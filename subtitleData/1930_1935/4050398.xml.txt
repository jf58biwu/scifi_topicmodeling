 ISLAND OF LOST SOULS Mr. Hogan ! Mr. Hogan ! Derelict afloat with a man on board ! - Whereabouts ? - Off your port bow ! Right ! - Get ahold of him , boys ! - We got him . - Wanna salvage that boat ? - No . Take him to my cabin . Ruth ! Ruth ! - Ruth ! - Easy , old man . Easy , easy , easy . What ship is this ? " Covena " , trading ship . We picked you up adrift . Oh , yeah . I remember . - Where 's she bound ? - Apia . Apia ? I 'm in luck . Luck ? Yeah . That 's where - - Where I was bound when my ship went down . - Yeah . The Lady Vain , wasn 't it ? - Yeah . We picked up her S.O.S. You - - you got a wireless aboard ? Yeah . - You send a message for me ? - Sure , sure . You better make it short . You got a lot of resting to do . Thanks . I suppose it 's to Ruth ? - How 'd you know her name ? - Heard nothing else for the last two hours . She 's my fiance . We 're going to be married in Apia . - Miss Ruth , uh - - - Thomas . Continental Hotel . What 's the message ? Tell her I was picked up by this boat ... And when we expect to arrive . Also , that I 'm all right , thanks to you , doctor . You are a doctor , aren 't ya ? Yes . At least , I was ... Once upon a time . - What 's up , old chap ? - Bulletin on the wreck , Lady Vain . Oh . Oh , yes . Good afternoon , miss van de Camp . Miss Thomas ? - Miss Thomas ? - Oh , right here . - For me ? - Radiogram . Thank you . - How do you feel ? - How do I look ? - Better . - That 's the way I feel . - A little turn around the deck will do you good . - Not a bad idea . You know , I thought I heard those things . Say , what is this , A floating zoo ? Well , yes , in a way . Good morning , captain . - I want to thank you for - - - Who 're you ? Mr. Parker , captain Davies . - Parker . Parker ? - We picked him up day before yesterday . Why wasn 't I told ? - We tried to wake you . - why didn 't ya ? You had a slight list to port . - What do you mean ? - You were drunk . Drunk , was I ? - Why wouldn 't I be , with a cargo like I got ? - Cargo is cargo . I know , but this boatload of filthy animals ? All the way from Mombassa to where ? To some island . Which island ? You answer me that , mr . Montgomery . You 're well-paid for it . An island without a name . An island not on the chart . You think I don 't know whose island that is , don 't ya ? - Well , I do , mr . " sawbones " Montgomery . - Easy , captain . Well , it 's Dr. Moreau 's island . Dr. Moreau 's island , and it stinks all over the whole South seas . That 's superstitious South sea gossip . Dr. Moreau is a brilliant man and a great scientist . Well , if you ask me , He 's a black-handed , grave-robbin ' ghoul . That 's what he is . Aw , what 's the use . You 're drunk . Ha ! Yeah ! Hey , what 'd you say ? - Nothing . - That 's all right then . What do ya got there ? - Slop for dog . - Slop ? Ain 't there slop on this deck already ? M 'ling , get out . Yeah , before I - - Why - - I 'm drunk , am I ? Only a drunken man would do a thing like that . That means trouble . There now . You 're all right . M 'ling ! Go forward and stay forward . Say , who is that fella ? My servant , that 's all . Now look here , Parker . You better get outta sight and stay out . There 'll be plenty of trouble when he comes to . Get him off there ! Overboard with the whole spittin ' mess of ' em . - Hey , is that Moreau over there ? - Yeah . Say , what is all this mystery about Moreau and his island ? I don 't know , but if I did know , maybe I 'd want to forget . Hogan ! Mr. Hogan ! Are we all free and clear ? All clear , sir ! - All right , cast off ! - Cast off ! All right , cast off ! All right , dr . Moreau , That 's the last of ' em ! And this is the last time I 'l ever pull in here ... Forevermore ! Amen ! I hear you 're gettin ' off here . No . I 'm gettin ' off at Apia . You 're gettin ' off here . Cast off . Now hurry it up . Now , what 's happened ? All right , old boy . Fell overboard . On deck . On deck ! Hey , you lost your man ! Well , finders keepers ! Full speed ahead , Hogan ! What 's that fool talking about ? Haul up that ladder ! I 've got to get to Apia ! - You can swim , can 't ya ? - Take this man with you ! There 's marine law ! This man 's shipwrecked and you 've got to pick him up ! I picked him up and dropped him in my first port of call . I can 't have this man aboard ! Well , throw him overboard . That 's what I did . Davies ! Drop that ladder ! - This is most unfortunate . - I simply must get to Apia . We sight a ship maybe once in a twelfth-month . - Uh , mr . Parker , dr . Moreau . - How do you do ? Mr. Parker , you may take Montgomery and the schooner ... And leave for Apia in the morning . That 's very nice . Thank you . Not at all . I 'm happy to be of service . Montgomery is a fair sort of sailor , And I can give you enough of a crew . Ouran ! Gola ! Get away from those cages ! Come on now . Let 's unload this stuff . The dogs first , then the monkeys , then the cages . Hurry it up ! I 'll stay with Parker tonight on the schooner . No . I 'm taking him to the house . Mr. Parker . - You can 't do that . - I 've got something in mind . - Would you come with me , please ? - Surely . - You understand you are an uninvited guest . - Certainly . You may find our domain rather strange . I shall have to rely upon your caution while you 're here ... - ... and you 're silence when you 're gone . - Of course , doctor . Limestone formation . Curious , isn 't it ? This was once the crater of a volcano . Extraordinarily fertile , this volcanic dust . Seeds blown hereby the wind and brought by birds . See the result . Don 't be alarmed , Mr. Parker . You 're quite expert with that whip , aren 't you , doctor ? It 's a hobby . I learned to handle one as a boy in Australia . There 's my house . Strange-looking natives you have here . You 'll be wanting a cold shower , I take it , before dinner . An excellent brandy , Montgomery . I hope you brought plenty . Then , of course , you did . Montgomery is a man to trust , Mr. Parker , Especially in the selection in the ordering of your liquors . M 'ling , you may take everything . Yes . You are a man of discretion , Mr. Parker . I hope so . Now , if you 'll excuse us . - M 'ling , brandy for mr . Parker . - Nothing more , thank you . That 'll be all , M 'ling . You may go . I should much prefer that you don 't leave this room . Your wish , doctor . I had my reasons for keeping you sober . - Go to the laboratory . See what 's to be done . - You 're not going ? I 'm taking her to Parker . - Lota to Parker ? - Why do I brought him to the house ? He 's seen too much already . She 's never seen anything like him . The only reactions we get from her are fear and terror . - That 's understandable . - But how will she respond to Parker ... Where there 's no cause for fear ? Will she be attracted ? Is she capable of being attracted ? Has she a woman 's emotional impulses ? I 'd scarcely hoped for a chance like this short of London . Lota . Lota . Come here . Lota , I 'e taught you many things . Yes . - All that you know , I 've taught you . - Yes . I 'm going to let you learn something for yourself . A man has come from the sea . I will take you to him . Let you talk with him . Yes ? I 'm going to leave you alone with him . You may talk with him about anything , About the world he comes from . But you must say nothing about me , nothing about the Law , Nothing about the House of Pain . - You understand me ? - Yes . Then come along with me . Get out ! Get out , I said ! It 's all right . Go in , Lota . - This is mr . Parker , Lota . - How do you do ? - Don 't be afraid . - How ... do you do ? Mr. Parker has come to us from over the sea . She 's a pure Polynesian . The only woman on the entire island . Well , uh , I 'l leave you two young people together . I 've got work to do . Won 't you sit down ? Cigarette ? No . - I thank you . - You 're welcome . You 'll have to pardon me because ... This is all very strange to me . What island are you from ? Tahiti ? Samoa ? I mean , where is your home ? Home ? This my home . I know , but you 're not a native of this island . I know because I 've seen some of them . How does it happen that you 're the only woman on this island ? Did dr . Moreau Bring you here ? Pardon me if I seem to be too inquisitive . Moreau . Quickly , please . You come from the sea ? Well , rather . Three days on an upturned lifeboat . You go away ? Tomorrow morning . I wish you would not go away . Well , that 's very nice of you . But ... I must . You come back again ? Well , I don 't know . What 's that ? It 's the house , the House of Pain . No , no ! It 's nothing ! It 's nothing ! Nothing ? Somebody 's being tortured ! Get out ! Get out ! They 're vivisecting a human being . They 're cutting a living man to pieces . Now I know about his natives . They 're his victims . You and I may be next . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Other gate . We 'll take Moreau 's boat and get away from here tonight . Now . Sea ! Sea ! Sea ! Sea ! Man from sea ! Man from sea ! Lota ! Stop ! Stop ! What ? What ? Man from sea , They are like us ! They are like him ? One is not man . - What is the Law ? - Not to run on all fours . That is the Law . - Are we not men ? - Are we not men ? - What is the law ? - Not to eat meat . That is the Law . Are we not men ? Are we not men ? What is the Law ? Not to spill blood . That is the Law . Are we not men ? Are we not men ? His is the hand That makes ! His is the Hand that makes ! His is the hand That heals . His is the Hand that heals ! His is the House ... Of Pain ! His is the House ... Of Pain ! I didn 't think you 'd be idiotic enough to leave the house . Now I can understand why you and your island ... stink from one end of the south seas to the other . What makes your natives such monstrosities ? I saw you vivisecting a man . My dear young fool , you 're entirely mistaken . You can 't get away with it in my case . Take it . I 'm now unarmed and you 're fully protected . It 's quite evident that I mean you no harm . Well , would you be good enough to come to the house ? Lota . Lota , go to your room ! I started with plant life in London 20 years ago . I took an orchid and upon it I performed a miracle . I stripped 100,000 years of slow evolution from it , And I had no longer an orchid ... But what orchids will be 100,000 years from now . That 's one there . Yes , but how , doctor ? By a slight change in the single unit of a germ plasm . That 's a common lily . That 's a chrysanthemum . That 's unfortunately what happened to some asparagus . I went on with this research just as it led me . I let my imagination run fantastically ahead . Why not experiment with the more complex organisms ? Man is the present climax of a long process of organic revolution . All animal life is tending toward the human form . I was still in London when I began this phase of my experiments . One day a dog escaped from my laboratory , Went shrieking into the streets , and I left London . The newspapers at my heels aroused England , crying for my blood . I picked up Montgomery and brought him along . He was a medical student ... Facing a prison term for a professional indiscretion . That was 11 long years ago , 11 long years I 've worked . Plastic surgery , Blood transfusions , Gland extracts with ray baths . With what I have discovered in my own work among the cellular organisms . My work , my discoveries , mine alone . With these I have wiped out ... Hundreds of thousands of years of evolution . From the lower animals I have made with - - Go see for yourself , Mr. Parker . - You 're convinced that this thing isn 't human . - Its cries are human . - You know what it is that I began with ? - No . - An animal . - An animal ? Like those in the cages outside ? Then those , creatures out in the jungle ? Are my creations . - They were made from animals ? - Yes . This thing , this poor , tortured creature - - What does that matter ? - Of all things vile ! - Mr. Parker , spare me these youthful horrors , please . And those ... those poor things out in the jungle , those animals , they , they talk . That was my first great achievement : Articulate speech controlled by the brain . That was an achievement . Oh , it takes a long time and infinite patience ... to make them talk . Someday I will create a woman and it will be easier . Those are some of my less successful experiments . They supply the power to create others ... more successful . With each experiment , I improve upon the last . I get nearer and nearer . Mr. Parker , do you know what it means to feel like god ? I 'm talking too much , aren 't I ? - Good night , Mr. Parker . - Good night . - You know the way to your room ? - Yes , thanks . I hope you sleep well . Thanks . Good night . Did you see that ? She was tender like a woman . How that little scene spurs the scientific imagination onward . I wonder how much of Lota 's animal origin is still alive . How nearly a perfect woman she is . It 's possible I may find out ... With the aid of mr . Parker . We won 't have much time if he leaves for Apia in the morning . Wouldn 't it be a great loss to science ... If he left for Apia in the morning ? I want to thank you , Doctor , for the - - - Happy to have been of service to you . - I appreciate what you 're - - Whoa ! Whoa , this is most distressing . I , I don 't know what to say . I can 't account for it . Unless the natives , they were a bit out of hand last night . You said it , mate . - Hello , darlin ' . How you been ? - Hello , baby . Did you miss me ? - Did I miss ya ? - Pardon me . Excuse me . Didn 't you have a mr . Parker on board ? - Parker ? - Yes . Oh . You better talk to the skipper . Now , men , stay sober . Any drinking to be done , I 'll do it myself . If you get in a fight , send for me . - Hello there , baby . - Captain , captain . Didn 't you have a mr . Parker On board ? - Parker ? - Yes . No . But won 't I do ? Didn 't you rescue him from the Lady Vain ? He sent me a wireless from your ship . Oh , yes . He got off at my first port of call . - But what port ? - That 's my business . Maybe the American consul will make it his business . Well , give the consul my regards . You knew this man wanted to come to Apia , didn 't you ? I rescued him at sea ... And dropped him off at my first port of call . What port ? - It was an island , sir . - What island ? Latitude 15 degrees south ... And longitude 170 west . 1-5 south , 1-7-0 west . Very small , sir . You won 't find it on the charts . Then it isn 't a port . Well , it 's an island , sir . I dropped some cargo there . Oh , I see . That 'll be all for the present . Yes , sir . If I find any irregularities , I 'll have your license revoked . - Yes , sir . - Wouldn 't like that , would you ? - No , sir . - I didn 't think you would . Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . - Good morning , captain . - Miss Thomas , this is captain Donahue . - How do you do ? - When will you be ready to sail ? - I 'm ready now , sir . You 'll find Donahue 's boat Perfectly safe , - But not very comfortable . - I 've worked her all over . - Are you clear on the position ? - Yes . 15 south and 170 west . - Okay . Well , good luck . - Thank you . - Thank you so much . - Not at all . Glad to be of service . Lota . You startled me . You 're a strange child . Talk to me . Not now . Talk to me . - Lota , do you know what this is ? - Book . Yes , book . From Dr. Moreau 's library . About electricity , wireless telegraphy , radio . How to build a shortwave transmitter . Course you haven 't the faintest idea ... What I 'm talking about , have you ? Talk to me more . All right . I 'l tell you something you will understand . Lota , I must get away from this island . Book ... take you away . Maybe book take me away . Lota ! Why did you do that ? Book take you away . Lota ... I 'm in love with someone else . I should have told you . Love ? Ohh ... Lota . - Moreau , you don 't deserve to live . - I beg your pardon . Those creatures in the jungle were horrible enough , But to have created that girl ... - Lota ? - Yes , Lota. oh , it 's criminal . You 're an amazingly unscientific young man . I could have overlooked those others . I could have shown you that much consideration . But now I 'l expose you to the world ... - for what you really are , Moreau . - When are you leaving ? I think you 'd better sit down and make yourself comfortable . - Would you care for a cup of tea ? - No , thank you . We may as well discuss this frankly , now that you know the facts . Lota is my most nearly perfect creation . I was thinking of taking her with me as exhibit " a " ... on a triumphal return to London . I wanted to prove how completely ... she was a woman , Whether she was capable of loving , mating ... and having children . She was afraid of Montgomery and myself . Then you came . Well , she was very much attracted to you . You can see , of course , the possibilities ... That presented themselves . I 'l tell you this , Moreau : You 'll make arrangements for me to leave this island ... As quickly as possible , Or this great scientific work you 've been doing will stop . How did he find out ? What did you say to him ? What did you do to let him know ? What is it , Moreau ? The stubborn beast flesh creeping back . It 's no use , Montgomery . I may as well quit . Day by day , it creeps back . It creeps back . You see this ? The first of them all to shed tears . She is human . I 'm not beaten . - Get everything ready ! - For what ? - This time I 'l burn out all the animal in her ! - No ! Aah ! - I 'l make her completely human ! - No ! No , no ! No ! No ! - I 'l keep Parker here . He 's already attracted . - No ! Time and monotony will do the rest . Gola ! Gola ! - Huh ? - Boat come ! Man ! One not man ! - One not man ? - One like Lota ! Hello in there . I guess it 's all right . - You afraid ? - No , of course not . All right . I just asked out of politeness . Look ! See some funny sights in these islands . That jungle don 't look any too inviting . We must go on . We 've got to find him . All right . But I 'd just as soon leave it for somebody else ... If there was anybody else here to do it . There 's a bird in these jungles , kind of a parrot . Laughs like a man . They call him a laughing jackass . Funny name for a bird . When you figure out he laughs like a man , That 's not such a funny name after all . You 're taking a very long time , Montgomery . There 's a short circuit here somewhere . M 'ling ! - M 'ling ! They come on boats ! - Who ? - Peoples . - People ? Two . One like Lota . Dr. Moreau ! Dr. Moreau ! Doctor ! - Dr. Moreau ! Boat come ! People ! - People ? - Man and one like Lota . - What ? Parker sent a wireless to Apia from Davies ' ship . Hello there . Ohh ! Ouran . We 're looking for a man named Parker . Edward Parker . - Oh . Won 't you come in ? - Yeah . Thanks . I 'm dr . Moreau . This is my house . You 're very welcome . Thank you , doctor . I 'm Ruth Thomas , - And this is captain Donahue . - How are you , doc ? - How do you do ? Go right in . - Nice place you got here . Serves its purpose . Ruth ! Oh . Ouran . All right I may not need Parker . Captain Donahue was good enough to bring me here . - How do you do , captain ? - Fine , thanks . How are you ? So you found him ? I 'd imagined Edward in some terrible place , - ... but this is charming . - I 'll get my things and we 'll be on our way . It 's getting late . You 'll pardon me , doctor . Not at all . Won 't you come in and wait ? Thank you . What kind of a place did you say this was ? - I didn 't say . - Oh . It 's an experimental station of a sort ... For bioanthropological research . Oh . I see . Lota ? House of Pain ? No . No House of Pain . I promise that . There 's no twilight in the tropics . Night falls like a curtain . Thank you , M 'ling . - Care for a highball , Miss Thomas ? - No , thank you . - Captain Donahue , I suppose - - - I 'll take mine straight . I thought so . Whoa . That 'll do . Thanks . - Mr. Parker ? - No , thanks . We 'll be going now . Aren 't you being a little rash ? - Rash ? - Come on , Donahue . You have a mile to go through my jungle . - Yes , I realize that . - We 're not afraid . I can see , captain Donahue , you would be afraid of nothing . But mr . Parker had one experience at night in my jungle . I have no wish to frighten you , Miss Thomas ... But if mr . Parker puts you in what he knows to be real danger , that will be his responsibility . Couldn 't you send someone - - If you 'd care to accept the hospitality of my house , You can leave in complete safety in the morning . Perhaps that would be better . Captain Donahue , you can share mr . Parker 's room . Miss Thomas , you can have my room . M 'ling , dinner Will be for five . No wine , Montgomery ? No . Extraordinary . - My regards , Captain Donahue . - Here 's mud in your eye , doc . Doc , I see you 're a vegetarian . It 's on account of the natives . - They 've never tasted meat . - No " long pig " ? " Long pig " ? - He means human flesh , miss Thomas . - Oh . What 's that ? The natives . They have a curious ceremony . - Mr. Parker has witnessed it . - Tell us about it , Edward . Oh , it 's - - it 's nothing . They are restless tonight . Oh ! Ohh . What is it , dear ? Oh , nothing . Uh ... Don 't pay any attention to me . - A little more claret , Captain Donahue ? - Don 't mind if I do . M 'ling , fill up Captain Donahue 's glass . Whoa , whoa , whoa . That 'll do . - Well ? - Skoal . - Good night , doc . That 's sure swell wine . - Thank you . - Good night , dr . Moreau . - Good night , miss Thomas . - Good night . - Good night . Whoa ! It 's a good thing I ain 't a drinkin ' man . - You did very well for yourself tonight . - You oughta see me when I 'm - - Yes , I have a rough idea . I remember one night down in Mombassa - - - Captain ... that 's our room over there . - Oh , sure . - Good night , miss Thomas . - Good night . Don 't be frightened , dear . - I 'll be just across the hall . - Oh , I 'm all right . What 's there to be afraid of ? - Good night . - Good night . - Better lock your door . - Now , don 't you worry . I 'lll be all right . - If you need me , call . - Good night . Aah ! Aah ! Ruth ! Ruth , what is it ? Quick ! You 'd better get dressed , dear . Ouran tried to break into her room . Miss Thomas ' room . - I suppose you know that . - I heard a scream and some shots . That 's all you know , is it ? You didn 't want it to happen , of course . That isn 't what you meant by not need Parker . Will you mind your own business ? I know you too well and too long , Moreau . I 'd have stood for anything . I have stood for plenty . But not this . You 're insane to even think of it , And I 'm through with you here and now . Are you going back to England ... to prison ? I 'd prefer it . Same one that peeked out through the bushes this afternoon ? Yes . It was horrible . We 're no safer here than in the jungle . I 'd advise the jungle . I 'm sure miss Thomas will be safer there . - I 'll go get my crew . We 'll stop this . - Come with me a minute . - I don 't like your taking this risk . - I been in tighter places than this ... and the old head is still on its hinges . - Here . You may need this . - No , no . I 'm already heeled . - I 'll take that lantern . It might come in handy . - Here . - Here 's a key to the front gate . - Well , here goes nothin ' . Ouran . Ouran , I want you to follow him ... And put your hands around his throat . - The Law . - It 's all right tonight . Get back there ! Get back ! Thanks , Montgomery . - You must have a reason for helping us . - I have . I 'm going with you . Get back ! Get back ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ... Ohh ! Uhh ! Aah ... Ouran kill ! Ouran break Law ! What is the Law ? Not to spill blood ! Are we not men ? Are we not men ? You broke the Law . Law no more . Law no more ? Law no more ? You spill blood . He tell me spill blood . What is the Law ? Law no more ! What is the Law ? Law no more ! Moreau ... They 're more than usually restless tonight . No more law ! No more law ! Where 's Captain Donahue ? No more Law ! This man like him ? Man like him . Man dead . - Dead . - He can die ? He can die . He can die ! He can die ! They 're quite out of hand tonight . Dr. Moreau ! Dr. Moreau ! They come ! They come to kill ! Where 's captain Donahue ? Dead . Give me the whip . - Don 't be a fool , Moreau , come on inside . - You afraid ? Lock the gates if you are . I 'm going to meet them . M 'ling , the faithful dog . What is the Law ? Law ... No more . What is the Law ? Not to spill blood . He tell me spill blood . What is the Law ? Law no more . Law no more ! No more law ! No more law ! - Come on , Montgomery . - Leave it open in case he runs for it . We 'll try the back way . Quick , they 're coming ! - Lota ! - Lota . We can 't leave her . Wait here . Have you forgotten the House of Pain ? No . You made us in the House of Pain . Pain ! House of Pain ! You made us ... Things ! - Not men ! - Things ! - Not beasts ! - Things ! Part man , part beast ! Things ! Things ! Things ! - Not man ! - Not beast ! Things ! Part man ! Part man , part beast ! Part man , part beast ! House of Pain ! Pain ! House of Pain ! Stop it , you fools ! This is the House of Pain ! No ! Stop ! The House ... Of Pain ! Pain ! Pain ! Pain ! What was that ? Where 's Lota ? You ... Go back ... To sea . She 's done for . - Come on . - We 'll take her to the sea . It 's better that we leave her here . The fire will soon destroy all of Moreau 's work . Ah ! Little knives ! Knives ! Aah ! Don 't look back . Subtitles by Duat

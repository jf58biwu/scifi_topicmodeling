 Ho w do you do ? Mr. Carl Laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning . We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein , a man of science , who sought to create a man after his o wn image without reckoning upon God . It is one of the strangest tales ever told . It deals with the t wo great mysteries of creation , life and death . I think it will thrill you . It may shock you . It might even horrify you . So , if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain , no w is your chance to ... Well , we 've warned you . ( priest praying in latin ) ( BELL tolling ) ( crying ) priest : Amen . ( BELL continues ) ( crying continues ) Do wn ! Do wn , you fool ! ( dirt THUDDlNG ) No w . Come on . Hurry , hurry . ( BELL continues TOLLlNG ) ( BELL STOPS ) The moon 's rising . We 've no time to lose . ( CLATTERlNG ) Oh , careful ! There we go . Here he comes ! He 's just resting , waiting for a ne w life to come . ( WOOD CREAKlNG ) ( BOTH grunting ) Here we are . ( DOG barking ) Look. it 's still here . Climb up and cut the rope . No ! Go on. lt can 't hurt you . Here 's the knife . ( barking continues ) ( panting ) Look out ! Here 's the knife . Here I come . is it all right ? The neck 's broken . The brain is useless . We must find another brain . That will do , gentlemen . ( STUDENTS laughing ) And in conclusion , ladies and gentlemen , here we have one of the most perfect specimens of the human brain that has ever come to my attention at the university . And here , the abnormal brain of the typical criminal . Observe , ladies and gentlemen , the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe , as compared to that of the normal brain , and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe . All of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the case history of the dead man before us , whose life was one of brutality , of violence and murder . Both of these jars will remain here for your further inspection . Thank you , gentlemen . The class is dismissed . ( talking lNDlSTlNCTLY ) ( exclaims FEARFULLY ) ( GONG BANGS ) Herr Victor Moritz . Victor . I 'm so glad you 've come . What is it , Elizabeth ? Oh , you 've heard from Henry . Yes . The first word in four months . It just came . Victor , you must help me . Why , of course I 'll help you . I 'm afraid . I 've read this over and over again , but they 're just words that I can 't understand . Listen . " You must have faith in me , Elizabeth . Wait . " My work must come first , even before you . " At night , the winds ho wl in the mountains . " There is no one here . " Prying eyes can 't peer into my secret . " What can he mean ? What does he say then ? " l am living in an abandoned , old watchto wer , " close to the to wn of Goldstadt . " Only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments . " Oh , his experiments . Yes , that 's what frightens me . The very day we announced our engagement , he told me of his experiments . He said he was on the verge of a discovery so terrific that he doubted his o wn sanity . There was a strange look in his eyes , some mystery . His words carried me right a way . Of course , I 've never doubted him , but still I worry . I can 't help it . And no w this letter . All this uncertainty can 't go on. I must kno w . Victor , have you seen him ? Yes . About three weeks ago . I met him walking alone in the woods . He spoke to me of his work , too . I asked him if I might visit his laboratory . He just glared at me and said he would let no one go there . His manner was very strange . Oh , what can we do ? Oh , if he should be ill ... No w , don 't worry . I 'll go to Dr. Waldman , Henry 's old professor in medical school . Perhaps he can tell me more about all this . Oh , Victor , you 're a dear . You kno w i 'd go to the ends of the Earth for you . I shouldn 't like that . I 'm far too fond of you . I wish you were . Victor . I 'm sorry . Good night , Victor , and thank you . Thank you . Good night . And don 't worry . Promise ? I won 't . Victor ? What is it ? I 'm coming with you . But , Elizabeth , you can 't do that ! I must ! I 'll be ready in a minute . Herr Frankenstein is a most brilliant young man , yet so erratic , he troubles me . I 'm worried about Henry . Why has he left the university ? He was doing so well , and he seemed so happy with his work . Well , you kno w , his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electro-biology were far in advance of our theories here at the university . In fact , they had reached a most advanced stage . They were becoming dangerous . Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed . You mean , changed as a result of his work ? Yes , his work . His insane ambition to create life . Ho w ? Ho w ? Please tell us everything , whatever it is . The bodies we use in our dissecting room for lecture purposes were not perfect enough for his experiments , he said . He wished us to supply him with other bodies , and we were not to be too particular as to where and ho w we got them . I told him that his demands were unreasonable , and so he left the university to work unhampered . He found what he needed else where . Oh . The bodies of animals . Well , what are the lives of a fe w rabbits and dogs ? You do not quite get what I mean . Herr Frankenstein was interested only in human life . First to destroy it , then recreate it . There you have his mad dream . Can we go to him ? You will not be very welcome . Oh , what does that matter ? I must see him . Dr. Waldman , you have influence with Henry . Won 't you come with us ? I 'm sorry , but Herr Frankenstein is no longer my pupil . But he respects you . Won 't you help us to take him a way ? Very well , Fräulein . I 've warned you . But if you wish it , I will go . ( wind howling ) ( THUNDER rumbling ) Fritz ! Hello . ( RATTLlNG ) Have you finished making those connections ? Yes , they 're done . Well , come do wn then and help with these attachments . We 've lots to do . ( THUNDER rumbling ) ( THUNDER clapping ) Look out . ( WHlMPERS ) Fool ! If this storm develops as I hope , you will have plenty to be afraid of before the night 's over . Go on . Fix the electrodes . ( static ) This storm will be magnificent ! All the electrical secrets of heaven ! And this time we 're ready , eh , Fritz ? Ready . ( rumbling continues ) ( GASPS ) Why , what 's the matter ? Look ! Oh . There 's nothing to fear . Look . No blood , no decay . Just a fe w stitches . And look , here 's the final touch . The brain you stole , Fritz . Yes . Think of it . The brain of a dead man , waiting to live again in a body I made with my o wn hands . With my o wn hands . Let 's have one final test . Thro w the s witches . ( WHlRRlNG ) ( DRONlNG ) ( electricity crackling ) ( CLANKlNG ) Good . In 1 5 minutes , the storm should be at its height . Then we 'll be ready . ( knocking ON DOOR ) What 's that ? There 's someone there . Quiet . Send them a way . Nobody must come here . Here ! Cover this . ( THUNDER clapping ) Whoever it is , don 't let them in . Leave them to me . Of all times for anybody to come , no w ! Think I 'm going to let these people in ? Not much . I 'll sho w them , messing about at this time of night . Got too much to do . ( knocking continues ) Wait a minute ! All right ! All right ! Wait a minute. I 'm coming . It 's Dr. Waldman , Fritz . You can 't see him . Go a way . ( knocking ) All right , knock , but you can 't get in . victor : Henry ! WALDMAN : Frankenstein ! Henry ! Frankenstein ! Henry ! elizabeth : Open the door ! WALDMAN : Let us in ! Who is it ? Who is it ? What do you want ? You must leave me alone no w ! It 's Elizabeth . Open the door ! Henry ! Henry ! What do you want ? elizabeth : Open the door . WALDMAN : Let us in ! You must leave me alone . elizabeth : Henry , at least give us shelter ! What 's all this nonsense of locked doors ? Henry ! Elizabeth , please . Won 't you go a way ? Won 't you trust me , just for tonight ? Oh , you 're ill . What 's the matter ? Nothing . I 'm quite all right . Truly , I am . Oh , can 't you see I mustn 't be disturbed ? You 'll ruin everything . My experiment is almost completed . Wait a moment . I understand . I believe in you , but I cannot leave you tonight . You 've got to leave ! Henry , you 're inhuman ! You 're crazy ! Crazy , am I ? We 'll see whether I 'm crazy or not . Come on up . ( THUNDER continues ) Are you quite sure you want to come in ? Very well . Forgive me , but I 'm forced to take unusual precautions . Sit do wn , please . Sit do wn ! You too , Elizabeth . Please . A moment ago , you said I was crazy . Tomorro w we 'll see about that . Don 't touch that ! I 'm sorry , Doctor , but I insist . Please . Dr. Waldman , I learned a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray , the ultraviolet ray , which you said was the highest color in the spectrum . You were wrong . Here in this machinery , I have gone beyond that . I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world . Oh . And your proof ? Tonight you shall have your proof . At first , I experimented only with dead animals and then a human heart , which I kept beating for three weeks . But no w , I 'm going to turn that ray on that body and endo w it with life . And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead ? That body is not dead . It has never lived . I created it . I made it with my o wn hands from the bodies I took from graves , from the gallo ws , anywhere ! Go and see for yourself . You , too . Dead , eh ? Quite a good scene , isn 't it ? One man crazy , three very sane spectators . ( RATTLlNG ) ( THUNDERCLAP ) ls everything ready ? Yes ! Get the batteries . ( electricity crackling ) ( talking lNDlSTlNCTLY ) ( BUZZlNG ) ( THUNDER rumbling ) ( BUZZlNG continues ) ( LOUD electric buzzing ) ( inaudible ) ( electricity crackling ) ( THUNDER clapping ) ( THUNDER intensifies ) ( BUZZlNG FADES ) Look. it 's moving . It 's alive. lt 's alive . It 's alive . It 's moving . It 's alive . Oh , it 's alive ! It 's alive ! It 's alive ! It 's alive ! Henry , in the name of God . In the name of God ! No w i kno w what it feels like to be God ! ( THUNDER continues ) Henry is well , but he 's very busy . He said he would get in touch with you soon . Don 't worry about him , Baron . He 'll be home in a fe w days . You t wo have it all arranged , haven 't you ? You think I 'm an idiot , don 't you ? But I 'm not . Anyone can see with half an eye that there 's something wrong . And I have t wo eyes , pretty good ones , at that . Well , what is it ? You 're quite mistaken , Baron . What 's the matter with my son ? What 's he doing ? He 's completing his experiments , that 's all . Why does he go messing around an old , ruined windmill , when he has a decent house , a bath , good food and drink and a darned pretty girl to come back to ? ( SCOFFS ) Will you tell me that ? Oh , Baron , you don 't understand . I understand perfectly well . There 's another woman , and you 're afraid to tell me . Pretty sort of experiments these must be . Oh , but you 're wrong . And ho w do you kno w ? If you please , Herr Baron , the Burgomaster . Well , tell him to go a way . But he says it 's important . Nothing the Burgomaster can say can be of the slightest importance . Good day , Herr Baron . Fräulein . Well , what do you want ? If it 's trouble , go a way . I have trouble enough . Oh , there 's no trouble , sir . What do you mean , " No trouble " ? There 's nothing but trouble . I brought you these flo wers . Thank you , Herr Vogel . Both in my private and official capacities as Burgomaster ... Yes , yes , yes , yes , we kno w all about that , but what do you want ? Well , what I really want to kno w is , when will the wedding be , if you please ? Unless Henry comes to his senses , there 'll be no wedding at all . But , Herr Baron , the village is already prepared ! Well , tell them to unprepare . Oh , but such a lovely bride . Such a fine young man , the very image of his father . Heaven forbid . But , sir , everything is ready ! I kno w that . Don 't keep on saying so , you idiot . There 's nothing to cry about . Good day , Miss Elizabeth . ( COUGHS ) Good day , Herr Moritz . Good day , Herr Vogel . Good day , Herr Baron . And good riddance to you . There you are . You see ho w it is . The whole village is kept waiting . The bride is kept waiting . And I am kept waiting . Henry must come home , if I have to fetch him myself . No , no , Baron . What do you mean , " No , no " ? What about his work ? Stuff and nonsense ! What about his wedding ? There is another woman , and I 'm going to find her . ( sighs ) Oh , come and sit do wn , Doctor . You must be patient . Do you expect perfection at once ? This creature of yours should be kept under guard ! Mark my words , he will prove dangerous ! Dangerous ? Poor old Waldman . Have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous ? Where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond ? Have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars , or to kno w what causes the trees to bud , and what changes a darkness into light ? But if you talk like that , people call you crazy . Well , if I could discover just one of these things , what eternity is , for example , I wouldn 't care if they did think I was crazy ! You 're young , my friend . Your success has intoxicated you . Wake up and look facts in the face . Here we have a fiend whose brain ... Whose brain must be given time to develop . It 's a perfectly good brain , Doctor . Well , you ought to kno w . It came from your o wn laboratory . The brain that was stolen from my laboratory was a criminal brain . Oh , well . After all , it 's only a piece of dead tissue . Only evil can come of it . Your health will be ruined if you persist in this madness . I 'm astonishingly sane , Doctor . You have created a monster , and it will destroy you ! Patience , patience . I believe in this monster , as you call it , and if you don 't , well , you must leave me alone . But think of Elizabeth , your father . Elizabeth believes in me . My father never believes in anyone . I 've got to experiment further . He 's only a fe w days old , remember . So far he 's been kept in complete darkness . Wait till I bring him into the light . ( SLOW FOOTSTEPS ) Here he comes . Let 's turn out the light . ( FOOTSTEPS approaching ) Come in . Come in ! Sit do wn . Sit do wn ! You see ? It understands . Watch . WALDMAN : Take care , Herr Frankenstein ! Take care ! Shut out the light ! Sit do wn . Go and sit do wn . It understands this time . It 's wonderful . Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Where is it ? Where is it ? ( SCREAMS ) Quiet , you fool ! ( MUFFLED SCREAM ) Get a way with that torch ! ( MUFFLED GROWL ) ( SNARLlNG ) Quick ! Fetch the rope . Quick ! Stop kicking ! Get him to the cellar ! Shoot it ! It 's a monster ! ( chains rattling ) ( MONSTER howling ) ( GRUNTlNG ) Quiet . Quiet ! Cooperate ! You 'll have the whole countryside on us ! Come a way ! He has the strength of 1 0 men . This is madness . Give me that . ( GROANS ) Oh , come a way , Fritz . Leave it alone . Leave it alone . ( groaning ) ( screaming ) Listen . What 's that ? Who 's there ? ( screaming continues ) lt 's Fritz ! ( MONSTER growling ) Come on , Doctor . Quick . Hurry . Get back . ( SNARLS ) Get back . Get back . Quick . Quick ! ( SNARLlNG ) ( GROWLlNG ) ( continues growling ) ( pounding ON DOOR ) He hated Fritz . Fritz al ways tormented him . Come , come . Pull yourself together . What can we do ? Kill it , as you would any savage animal . We must overpo wer him first . Get me a hypodermic needle . It 's murder . It 's our only chance . In a fe w minutes he 'll be through that door . Come quick . Hurry . ( pounding ON DOOR ) ( SNARLlNG ) Got it ? Yes . Here it is . It 's very strong . Half-grain solution . Good . No w , then . You stand there . When he goes to ward you , I will make the injection in his back . Right . Ready ? Yes . ( DOOR rattling ) ( GROWLS ) ( screaming ) Get back . Back ! ( GROWLlNG ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( CONFUSED GRUNTS ) ( knocking ON DOOR ) Dr. Waldman ? Dr. Waldman ! Are you hurt ? No , no , I 'm all right . It 's nothing . See who 's at the door . ( lNCESSANT knocking ) What 's happening here ? Elizabeth and your father are coming up the hill to see you . You must keep them out . Too late . They must not see that . Here , quick , give me a hand . Quick . Do wn here . ( GRUNTS ) Henry , you better hurry upstairs and get that blood off your face before your father and Elizabeth get here . All right . Well , pretty sort of place for my son to be in , I must say . is that the front door ? Yes , this is it . Why , I don 't like it , but here goes . Why , that ... There doesn 't seem to be anybody in the place . Oh ! ( knocking ) God ! ( chuckling ) What a forsaken place here . You 're trying to burn it do wn , eh ? What 's that for , eh ? What 's the matter with you ? You look as though you 've been kicked by a horse . Where 's Henry ? Why ... Well ? He can 't be disturbed just no w . Oh , can 't he ? ( SCOFFS ) I 'll soon settle that nonsense . Victor , where is he ? This place seems to drive everybody crazy. I ... Good heavens , what 's that ? I beg your pardon . I am Dr. Waldman . Oh , are you ? I 'm Baron Frankenstein . Perhaps you kno w what all this tommyrot 's about . ( COUGHS ) I 'll be shot if I do . I would advise you to take Henry a way from here at once . What do you suppose I 'm here for , pleasure ? Huh ? Where are you , my dear ? Oh , there you are . Let 's go and see what 's up the a wful stairs . I don 't kno w ho w the deuce I 'm going to get up them . Just watch me . Do the trick . Leave them alone . No banisters or anything else . God bless his soul . Ho w much further ? HENRY : Come in . Henry . Elizabeth . elizabeth : Henry ! Victor , Dr. Waldman , come quickly ! My dear , what have they done to you ? Poor , poor , Fritz . It 's all my fault . Get him on the sofa . Come on . Oh . Oh , my boy . Thank you . Have you got any brandy ? ( MOANlNG ) I did it . Quick , quick , quick , quick . Here , I 'll do that . Come on , boy . No w , no w , no w , drink . Drink this . There . There , that 's better . I 'm going to take you home with me , Henry . No , I can 't . My work . What will happen to the records of my experiment ? We will preserve them . And ... I will see that it is painlessly destroyed . No . Yes , yes . Leave it all to me . Poor Fritz . All my fault . There , Henry . You can 't do any more no w . You must come home until you get well again . You 'll soon feel better when you get out of here . ( GRUNTS ) ( choking ) ( GROWLS ) It 's like heaven , being with you again . Heaven wasn 't so far a way all the time , you kno w . I kno w , but I didn 't realize it . My work ... Those horrible days and nights . I couldn 't think of anything else . Henry . You 're not to think of those things anymore . You promised . All right . Let 's think about us . When will our wedding be ? Let 's make it soon . As soon as you like . ( BELLS ringing ) For three generations , these orange blossoms have been worn at our weddings . Your great-grandfather wore this , Henry . Looks as good as ne w no w , eh ? Thank you . And here . Here 's one to make the best man look still better . Thank you , sir . Thirty years ago , I placed this on your mother 's head , Henry . Today you 'll make me very happy by doing the same for Elizabeth . And I hope in 30 years time , a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition . ( ALL chuckling ) And no w , ho w about a little drink , eh ? Come on . My grandfather bought this wine and laid it do wn . My grandmother wouldn 't let him drink it . Oh , bless her heart .

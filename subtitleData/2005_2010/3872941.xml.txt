 What have you got for me , Fitz ? I knew you 'd be the guy to call on this , Kev . This is big , and I figured you 'd have the connections to ... Show me . I 'm just the middle man . Are you the buyer ? It depends . What are you selling ? Alien technology ... the good stuff . Watch the paint . What is it ? You don 't know ? You don 't know , do you ? is it a weapon ? Does it fire ? Can it blow stuff up ? See , this is important information for a prospective buyer . It 's alien technology , man . It 's gotta be worth some money . Are you interested or not ? Just chill . Let me talk to my partners . Partners ? You didn 't say anything about partners . Neither did you . You 're working with him ? Actually , I 'm working with her . Kevin doesn 't really work , he just stands around flexing his muscles . Yeah , how about I flex ' em in your face ? Who are these jokers , man ? I can 't tell you . I 'm just the middle man . We 're just some regular old folks who are beginning to think this is a big , fat waste of our time . What do we got ? I 've never seen anything like ' em , Ben . They 're complex . Must be grade 9 tech at least . Whatever they are , they 're screwing up the Omnitrix . What 's with you guys ? I 've never met buyers like you before . You never met anyone like them before because they 're not just black market lowlifes like you . They 're Plumbers . You mean they 're gonna pay for this stuff by fixing my toilet ? The Plumbers are a secret interplanetary security force , saving the world so we don 't have to . Oh , right , of course . We 're cops from outer space . Or maybe , we 're firemen from Atlantis . How did you learn about these Plumbers you think we are ? Everything I know about the Plumbers , I learned the same way you did ... Ben . Elena ? No . Way . Oh , you still remember me . I 'm honored . Hello ? Can anyone toss me a clue as to what 's going on here ? Kevin , this is Elena Validus . She 's a Plumbers ' Kid , like us . Not like you , Gwen . None of my ancestors were aliens . I don 't have any cool powers to rely on . We hung out for a while back in the day . Then Elena 's dad quit . And you moved away and we haven 't heard from you since . is that what they told you ? That my dad quit ? Considering that you have more power than all the Plumbers combined , you sure don 't know much . Then why don 't you tell me ? What 's going on ? What are you doing here with these chips ? I 'm here to find you . The Plumbers don 't exactly advertise . I need your help , Ben . It 's my father . He 's been abducted . Call the cops . They can 't help . His disappearance is connected with these alien chips . We 'll help you find him , Elena . You 're a Plumbers ' Kid , and a friend . Am I , Ben ? Really ? Because life 's been pretty hard for the last three years , and I don 't recall you ever looking us up . What is that ? Elena ? - l don 't know . - lt 's a double-cross . A trap , Ben . No ! swear it ! I just wanted your help ! Don 't wanna impose on your little dysfunctions , so ... Bring them back to us . Kevin , I think you were right about these not being ordinary computer chips . Stay down ! Gwen ! Ben ! I don 't mean to backseat drive , but it might be a good time for the Omnitrix . Not ! I think it 's having a meltdown or something . Don 't sweat it , dude . If you can 't handle it ... I know someone who can . What 's going on ? They 're all , like , freaks or something ! Let 's get outta here , man ! They 're not just chips . It 's some kind of alien nano-technology . The attack is too organized . There must be intelligence behind it . I don 't know if he 's intelligent , but I think we found the puppeteer . That 's not good . Ready or not ! Come on , Spider Monkey . Big Chill ? That 'll work . Hold on , Gwen ! Are you all right ? Yeah . Thanks . Who is that guy , Elena ? I don 't know . Then let 's find out . No ! Gwen ! Gwen , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Who is that guy ? I think you mean , who was he ? Elena ? If you 're looking for your girlfriend , I think your personal charm was too much for her . Kevin was right .. she set us up . Did she ? I 'm not so sure . This whole thing is wrong from top to bottom . Yeah , starting with that crazy biker babe girlfriend of yours . Elena 's not my girlfriend , Kevin . We were , like , 13 . Her story doesn 't add up , Ben . Why sell alien tech on the black market just to find the Plumbers when her father used to be one ? She said that something happened to her dad back when they lived here , and we weren 't told the truth about it . If that 's the case , Grandpa Max has some serious explaining to do . I 'm sorry , that old girl 's gonna need new pistons . There 's no getting around it . - Hey , Ed . - Hey , guys . Gotta grab something out of the back . Hey , Ben , you going to the game tomorrow ? Uh ... I hope so , Molly . Just got hit with some serious , uh , homework . You know Benji , all work and no play . Seriously , look , that 's the best I can do for you . I don 't make the price , I just fix the cars . I don 't recognize it , and I really don 't like it . Me neither . Sooner we get that under the scanner , the sooner we can hunt down that creep and his army of flying chips . You mean the chips your gal pal illegally had in her possession ? All right , Kev . I think he gets it . I don 't get what you see in him . System 's up . Good afternoon , Ben . Now activating all partitions . Ben , did you ask Grandpa Max if we could use the Comm Center ? You wanna start solving this thing , or you wanna go looking for a permission slip ? Engaging comprehensive interior and exterior scan . Biological and inorganic matter detected . Molecular density is inert . Austenitic , ferritic , and martensitic phase microstructure . Both organic and inorganic materials . Gwen , you are a credit to the science club . I 've never seen anything like this . I mean , it 's tech , but it 's also a carbon-silken based life form . So they 're alive . Man , I 'm liking these less and less . Well , they were alive , kind of . Now they 're in alien chip heaven . Let me see if I can trace where they came from . They 're completely inert . I can 't pick up any energy signature . What now ? Well , maybe I can jumpstart an energy pulse , but it will take forever , and it 'll be a total pain in the ... All right , I 'll get right on it . Or , we could just find Elena , and ask her where they came from . What makes you think that she would tell you the truth ? She could have set us up . She 's one of us . She was one of us . You have no idea who she is now . You can 't trust her . Evidently I can 't trust anyone . I can 't even trust Max . Trust me to do what ? Hey , Grandpa . We can 't trust you to make soup without putting baked hummus , or lizard gizzards in it . Hmm . That sounds like a pretty good combo . What are you guys doing down here in the hole on off hours ? Uh , we had a little situation . Commencing scan . Hey , what 's that ? Looks familiar . I 've seen that somewhere before . You have ? Where ? Max , there 's something you need to explain ... Unidentified intrusion at entryway three . Sounds like we 've got an uninvited guest . Kev , punch up a tracker on the complex . No need . I 've got ' em . They 're in Max 's office ! They better not touch my model train set ! I just painted the caboose ! Over here , guys . Whoever you are , you picked the wrong place to break into . You 're gonna be one fried , roasted and baked ... babe ? It 's okay , Max . You probably don 't recognize her , she 's ... lt 's not okay . It 's a Validus . How 'd you get in here ? It 's time to get Big Ed some glasses . Been a long time , Mr. Tennyson . You shouldn 't have come here , Elena . Max , Elena was the one who set up the sale of those weird chips . Of course . I knew I 'd seen those before . It 's time for you to go ! Mr. Tennyson , I had to do that . I need help , and it was the only way I could think of to get it . You know the rules ! It 's my father ! He 's been kidnapped by whoever , or whatever made those chips . I knew that only The Plumbers could help . Get her outta here ! You 're not serious . She needs help . That 's an order ! You heard the man . I don 't know what 's going on , but he means it . Come on , Elena . Then I 'll tell you what 's going on , Gwen . Your sweet old grandpa turned his back on us three years ago ... Threw us out on the street when we needed his help , lied to you to cover his tracks . Now my father is in serious trouble , and Max still won 't help us . is that true ? Can 't we just talk to her ? No , Ben . Anything she said would be a lie . Kevin . Thanks for the help . You guys are real heroes . And , Ben , thanks for being a real friend . What 's wrong with you ? There 's nothing wrong with me , but there 's a lot wrong with her . She 's Victor Validus ' daughter . Okay , I 'm sufficiently stumped . What 's going on here ? Dr. Victor Emilio Validus . Plumber l.D ... Victor Validus was the best Plumber I ever trained . We stopped more than our share of invasions . I trusted Vic with my life . I wanted to trust the running of this place to him . Until he betrayed me . What ? He was caught stealing alien technology from our vaults . Tech that he swore he 'd protect the earth from . He was given a dishonorable discharge . A traitor . Traitor 's daughter 's left the building . What did he steal ? Same stuff Elena was dealing . You still think she 's the girl you know ? She told us the truth about one thing , you lied to us . I did that for your own good . You were too young to understand . I still don 't understand . You can 't judge her by what her father did . Ben , stay away from her . The Validus family is blacklisted . There can be no interaction between them and the Plumbers . That 's the way you see it . The way I see it , a friend is in trouble . And she 's the best link we have to those chips and the freak who 's controlling them . A whole lot more people could end up in trouble besides Elena and her father . That 's why we are going to analyze those chips and take care of this crisis by the book ! I am not gonna boot up this whole operation on the word of that one girl . Ben . That is my decision ! Well , it 's the wrong decision . I order you to stay away from her . Sorry , Max , I 'm not following that order . Ben ! You can 't break Plumber ranks ! Max , don 't let him do this . It 's not up to me . He 's made his choice . Kev ? Somebody 's gotta stay here and look after the old man . Kevin ! Stop him ! Don 't worry . I can handle myself . What do you want ? The same thing as you ... I wanna help you find him . What about your Gramps ? Not too thrilled about it . And you 're helping me anyway ? Nice bike . It 's Max 's really . Can 't get any more angry with me than he already is . I 'm sorry . That 's my fault . Nah , it 's his . Let 's find your dad . First stop .. wherever you got your hands on those chips . Grandpa . Am I interrupting something ? Find your wayward cousin ? He 'll be back ... alone , hopefully . Yeah , so what 's the 41 1 on those two ? Elena was Ben 's first crush . She was the only girl on his soccer team in middle school , and Ben couldn 't kick a ball in a straight line when she was around . He was really bummed out after she moved away . Great , so now it 's puppy love . Cousin Ben 's growing up . It had to happen some time . Yeah , I 'll believe that when I see it . Invalid codec . Access to mainframe denied . Kev , what are you doing in Max 's office ? I wanted to know what intel we already had on those chips . If Validus took them from a vault , they should be in the system . And ? All the files are sealed . Well , then you should just ask Max . I tried that . He wasn 't open to discussion . So you just came in here and opened up his personal files ? What did they say ? They 're sort of locked . I could figure out the password ? That would be a huge violation of trust . And regulations . Well , I guess Ben is really on his own this time . I 'm sure he 'll be fine . I mean , he 's all grown up now and everything . Break the code . Now implementing search for variable internodes based on random numeric ciphers . Don 't worry . Yes , yes , our tests are all complete . Please , we must know . is it time ? Oh , yeah , pal , it 's time . Time for you to give us your money . Hey , we 're talking to you , loony toon . Don 't you know this is a bad part of town ? You shouldn 't be out here walking all alone . Alone ? We are not alone . We are never alone . Your wallet , fool ! We offer you so much more than money . We offer you a new life ! Join us ! Help us ! Rule with us ! My dad started acting really weird a couple months ago . I followed him one night to this place . Well , hanging out around here certainly classifies as weird . That 's a good girl . Bring him here to us . He can 't help you now . What was he doing , racing cockroaches ? He has a laboratory set up . Whatever he was working on , he didn 't want me involved . Then he stopped coming home at all . Come on . To the final staging area . Take care of our guests . What was he doing here ? He was studying the chips . Boy , when your dad takes up a hobby , he doesn 't mess around . Someone 's been here ... taking things . Or looking for things . Elena , these notes , he wasn 't studying the chips , he was upgrading , developing them . Look at all this . Your dad was crazy . You 're wrong . He 's a brilliant man , he just became possessed by his work . Why ? He said these things posed some kind of threat . The Plumbers didn 't believe him , so he took them . Now they won 't lift a finger to help him . And Max is kind of a stickler about the Plumber rulebook . This is where l found those chips in storage canisters . They were all over the place . Looks like your dad had business with Ship-lt . You think he could have sent the chips somewhere ? Well , whoever has your dad wanted these chips . The freak from the drop . Do you know who that is ? I have no idea . I just want my father back , Ben . We 'll get him . I promise . Who are you ? What do you want ? We want to help you . No thanks , we 're good . Just browsing . Whoa , look at their eyes . It 's not just their eyes . Look , the chips . They 're infected . They 're being controlled . We want you to meet the queen . And we would love to do that , but all the bowing and curtsying , I don 't think so . There 's too many of ' em , like they were expecting us ... like this is a trap . No , I swear it ! Looks like we could use some help . From a static squiggly blob ? Not good . Fire escape ! Run ! Ben ! Whoa ! No ! What do we do ? Okay , I think I got it . So if these chips are actually alive , like some form of techno-organic interface , then the watch must be in overdrive to scan ' em . Can we have this pop quiz another time ? Maybe I can redirect the scan back at the chips , if I can just boost the power . I got it ! Hey , not bad . Not great , either . Come on , let 's go ! Elena , get on ! Thanks . You 're pretty good on this thing . And you can hold your own in a fight . So what do we do now ? Visit the shipment center and find out what your dad was up to . Maybe even find your dad . Whatever he sent is long gone now . You sure about that ? This was dated today . I thought you said he 's been missing for weeks . He has . You believe me , don 't you ? I believe ... we 'll find something at the Ship-lt . Who were you gonna sell the chips to , Victor ? I keep telling you ... I had to take them . It was for research . Those chips , they 're a threat . They 're planning something . That is a lie ! They 're dead ! The lab boys said they 're nothing but alien tech , no threat at all . Who 's your buyer ? The hive , they want us ! They 're coming for us , Max ! They 're coming for us all ! I 'm telling you the truth , Max ! You 're gonna have to do better than that , Victor . I know you . Gramps has a great bedside manner there , Gwen . Validus was like , his prized pupil . I think Max really felt his betrayal . I wonder if ... You think Max 's getting stabbed in the back is keeping him from seeing straight ? That would make ... Ben right . And that 's a scary thought . And not just because I hate it when he 's right . So , what if this loony isn 't so loony ? What if the chips weren 't dead ? Like , some kind of species of insects that can remain dormant for decades . I learned that from watching The Science Channel . Your depth of knowledge astounds . Now commencing thermal and spatial analysis of all targets . Have any luck getting a trace on their energy signature ? Your wish was my ... headache inducing project . Targets identified . Absolute locations displayed in a radial curve , commencing at 38 degrees latitude ... The chips are showing up in a 100-mile radius . 96 degrees longitude . Kevin ! You did it ! The cheek ? I find all the big bad alien chips , and all I get is a kiss on the cheek ? Greatest concentration of chips ... is clustered here . It 's the Ship-lt distribution center . It 's only about an hour from here . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? That we 're going against orders and are no better than Ben . You had to mention it . Destination at absolute distance of 49.87 miles . Come on , it 's open . It 's open , huh ? It 's open now . Remind me why we drove all the way out here again . They were here , Kev . We 're too late . Yeah . That 's what I get , too . And there 's , like , nothing here anymore . There 's something . Let 's check it out . London , Paris , Shanghai . These orders originated from this location , and are headed all over the world . Literally . Air , sea , by every means , they have . Must be thousands of crate orders . Maybe 100,000 . Kevin , what do you think it means ? It means we 're at least one step behind something disturbingly huge . May I help you ? Um , hi , we just had a few questions . Ship-lt is closed right now . Please return during regular business hours . And what are you doing here in the dark ? We are workers . We live to obey . Well , you must be employee of the month . Look , Mister , we just need to take some of these documents for a little school project . I 'll bring ' em right back after we turn in our report . Okay ? No , you will remain . You will join us . I 'm gonna have to insist . Your desires are irrelevant . The queen 's will supersedes all . Well , tell your queen to supersede this . What 's that weirdo doing ? Don 't know . Praying to the great god of bubble wrap ? Kevin ! Okay , these chips are now officially an issue . That 's new . They couldn 't form solid shapes before . Could the chips be learning ? Come on , not the glass ! That 's custom ! Let 's get out of here ! Thank you for using Ship-lt . You should teach a driving class . Defensive drivers are the safest drivers . Looks like we have company . I think they 're getting smarter . Then so will we . Okay , so we gotta get smarter and faster . Watch out ! The Ship-lt office is right up over here . What was that ? The most obnoxious muscle car in the world . We 're taking a detour . I can 't lose ' em ! Kevin , no ! Hang on ! Are you okay ? Yeah . It hurts when I laugh , but I don 't think that 'll be a problem . I don 't know who 's behind all this , but they 're gonna fix my car ! You think they gave up ? I don 't know . Maybe they just wanted to scare us . Well , they succeeded . Nice timing . That 's kinda whatev . That 's kind of a nightmare . It 's got Humongusaur ! I wouldn 't count on it . Oh , no . Don 't do what I think you 're gonna do . That was so cool . Are you okay , Ben ? You destroyed my car ! What were you doing here ? Well , I had a sudden urge to ship something overnight , and suddenly we 're up to our neck in your girlfriend 's chips . And that 's right about the time you came along and annihilated my car ! Those chips aren 't mine ! I was trying to warn you ! Thanks . I 'll consider myself warned . They 're more than just autonomous tech . We found a hive of them at the Ship-lt office , and they 've infected the clerk .. absorbed him . Yeah , we just ran into his extended family and they wanted to adopt us . No kidding . They must have analyzed the threat and evolved . They 're clearly a highly adaptive species . And it looks like they still have some life left in them . We 've gotta get some of these active chips back to the lab right away . Maybe they 'll give us a clue about what happened to my father . Maybe we 'll give you a call because you 're not coming with us . You 're trouble in a jug . Oh , I 'm coming with you , all right . Ben , didn 't Elena just lead you into a nest of techno-organic zombies ? She 's coming . One .. she 's in too much danger on her own now . And two ... I trust her . Speaking of which . What 's that ? A quick and trustworthy cab service . This is an all-point alert from field operative 219 . Escalating incidents of an unidentifiable nature , presumed alien . Request immediate assistance . Where in the Sam Hill has everybody been ? I 'm getting reports on alien activity from installed Plumbers all over the globe ! Max , I ... We can settle our problems later . And she stays in the brig . It 's the chips ... Validus ' chips . She told you that ? It 's true . The chips Validus stole have become active . Very active . These things were nothing more than extraterrestrial hardware . This is impossible . They also have a nasty habit of burrowing into people and taking over their minds . They have an unusual energy signature . Can you use that to pinpoint it ? Already done . Targets reanalyzed . Absolute locations appear in a radial curve . Target is experiencing exponential growth at an absolute rate of 10,000 to 1 on an ascendant curve . That 's no 100-mile radius . Millions of ' em . And spreading at an increasing rate . So in other words , they are a threat , just like my father said . Those things were not alive three years ago . Your father 's tinkering probably activated ' em somehow . Now they 're a threat to the entire world . You 're wrong . They were hibernating . Just ask your know-it-all granddaughter . Knock it off , both of you . Let 's work on a solution , not blame . Well ... at least we know where they are . Well , what are we waiting for , let 's start shooting . What about the people who are already infected ? If it 's between me and a Ship-lt clerk , I 'm gonna pick me . No , Kev , there 's gotta be another way . - The queen . - What ? That 's right . The infected people , they all went on about their queen . You mean a queen like in an insect colony ? In a beehive or anthill , there 's only one queen . She lays all the eggs , produces all the offspring , and tells everybody what to do . The Science Channel . How do you destroy a hive ? Remove the queen , the bees disband . The queen dies , the hive dies . We have to find the queen . All right , people , nobody sleeps tonight . I 'm gonna dissect these chips to see what they 're made of . Kevin , we need to find a more effective way around those drones . Gwen , find a way to disrupt the connection between those things and their human host . Ben , they 're 100 million chips out there . Gonna be like finding a needle in a haystack to find the queen in there , but get on it . Now , Elena , since you 're here , you 'll help too . I don 't want her going two feet without an escort . Okay , people , let 's move ! My calculations recommend point-specific analysis gradient to regional demographics as related to current geographic coordinates . Now commencing thermal and spatial analysis of all targets . Duration ... Gwen , why don 't you get some shut-eye ? We need that brain of yours working if things get hot . Just for a few minutes . And you 'd better wake me up . You too , get some rest . No chance . I 'll sleep when my dad is home safe and sound . Suit yourself . Thanks , Ben ... for taking the risk to help me , for going up against the team . Just like old times , right . The guys didn 't want you on the soccer team and I stood up to them for you to join . You ended up being our MVP . You 're not doing this for old times ' sake . No , I 'm doing it because I know what it 's like to be on your own in a tough situation you never chose to be in . I didn 't ask to get stuck with this . It just happened . And no one who isn 't me knows how that feels . I think I do . Max , we need help with a map analysis . Max ? Snap out of it , Max ! It 's Ben ! Ben , stop ! Max ! We have to restrain him , but be careful not to ... Hurt him . What ? He 's restrained . Max , are you okay ? We 're fine . Never better . Why are you all looking at us like that ? We 're great . We 're happy . We 're going to colonize earth . He usually has a lot of odd jobs for us . But that one 's new . Grandpa ! Fight it , Max ! Come on ! You can 't stop what 's coming . The Plumbers are finished . Mankind is finished . Max ! Max ! Where did he go ? No one knows these tunnels like Max . He 's long gone . Now what ? Like it or not , he usually tells us what to do . We need him . No , we don 't . He needs us . We have to find the queen and stop her . Helping Max is gonna be the least of our problems . Wherever the alien queen is , that 's where we 'll find your father and Max . We stop her , we stop the spread of these chips . And just how do you suggest we do that ? Current geographic coordinates . Does anything seem weird to you guys about this map ? Color choices are a bit drab . Try sea foam blue . Check out the concentration of the chips ... London , New York , Paris , Munich , and central Missouri ? There are millions of people in all those cities , but that part of Missouri is ... The middle of nowhere . It 's barely a town . The only thing in Barren Rock is ... The world distribution center for Ship-lt . Right ! Those shipments from the local hub would have been the first wave of sentry soldiers . Now we 're talking total immersion . And they need a big enough base to spread that many chips across the entire planet . Come on , they 're taking over the world by 24-hour shipping ? What 's your brilliant theory ? Look , I think that 's where the chips are being manufactured and distributed . And that 's where we 'll find the queen . Sounds like we 're in for a road trip . What do you mean , " we " ? Fine , she 's coming . Now we just have to figure out how ... with Kev 's car out of commission . Kev made this for your birthday present . My birthday was two months ago . You can 't rush genius . Oh , my gosh , Kevin . It 's beautiful ! " She . " She 's beautiful . You call a car a " she . " And you 're right . Don 't be jealous , you 've got some good qualities , too . A car . Your friend built you a car . Well , the weapons and defense systems aren 't online yet , but she 'll run . Yeah , the fact is , she 'll pretty much eat anything in her path . I don 't know what to say . I can 't wait to test her out . Oh , you 're not driving . I said I was going to give you the car . That was before you bailed out on the team . I 'm keeping her . - Oh , I 'm driving . - How do you figure ? Humongusaur would be happy to throw the car to Missouri . I like it . I 'm thrilled . Missouri in February ... a dream vacation , only 40 degrees colder . Let me get a closer look . It 's like a small army ... or not so small . Check it out . We 're gonna be fighting some serious odds down there . The people ... they 're all infected . Oops . That 's coming out of your zombie paycheck . All those crates are filled with chips . God , there must be millions . Probably six billion . That 's how many people there are on earth . Okay , let 's get inside . Looks like that 's where we wanna be , right in there . Oh , no ! Grandpa ! Gwen , no . If he sees us , he 'll alert the others we don 't belong here . He 's one of them now . Hive mind . It 's up to us . It 's like a human assembly line . No sign of her royal highness , the queen . There 's someone we know . It 's the creep from back at the mill . That 's Victor Validus . I knew it . I told you not to trust her . It 's not like that . You knew your father was behind this the whole time . You said you didn 't know that guy . I don 't . That 's not my dad . He 's become some kind of freak . Well ... I think we found out how they 're making those chips . No . You expect me to believe you 're on our side ? I knew not to trust you . No , you 're wrong . You don 't understand . You 've got a lot of explaining to do . Not here , she doesn 't . They 're both in this together . It 's a trap . - Back off ! It 's okay ! - Yeah , how is this okay ? Ben , her father is reproducing those chips . He 's the one controlling this whole operation . is he ? It looks like the chips are controlling him , just like Max ! It 's not a trap . I trusted you , Elena . I had to lie . I knew you 'd react like this . Refuse to help me , treat me like the enemy , just like they did to my father . Then I guess you don 't know us as well as you thought . Right ? I 'm sorry . I just wanted this nightmare to end . Well ... looks like it 's just beginning . So that 's what those plans were for . He was conducting tests on himself . He 's the hive . His own body is producing them by the thousands , every minute . In a colony , only the queen can reproduce . So ... The queen is inside of my dad . We gotta shut ' em down , Ben . Destroy him , destroy the queen . No ! You can 't ! I 'm sorry , Elena , but Kevin may be right . If it 's a choice between one man and the entire human race ... You said you 'd save him ! It 's not his fault ! He 's being controlled by the queen ! Dude , I know this is hard , but unless you take out this guy , the whole world falls . You know what Max would do . I don 't know what Max would do , but I know what I wouldn 't do . I don 't destroy victims , I save them . What 's your plan , Ben ? It looks like all the soldier chips have been rendered dormant for shipping . If I stop the queen before she can activate them , it looks like we have a chance of beating this thing . Ben , wait a minute , what do we do if Alien X or Humongusaur gets absorbed by the hive ? It 's all over . Absorbed by the hive is pretty much what I had in mind . Remember when the Omnitrix scanned the chips ' DNA ? I can fight them from the inside if I become one of them . The watch has been cooking this up the whole time . It 's time to take it out of the oven . Ben , this isn 't like anything that you 've become before . Kevin 's right . It 's a hive mind based organism . So ? So , I think the Omnitrix can turn you into one of these things , but I 'm not so sure it can keep you in control once it does . You may become a permanent slave to the hive . A turbo-charged killer weapon slave . Ben , no . I don 't wanna lose you , too . We 're out of options . I have to put my faith in the Omnitrix . It always has to be your way , doesn 't it , Ben ? ! Just like walking out on the Plumbers . Okay , so maybe I should have stayed and talked it out , but this is different . Why ? This is something I don 't wanna do , I just don 't see any other way ! Aaahh ! Elena ! Guys , look ! Ben , what do you want us to do ? - Keep ' em busy . - How ? ! I trust you . What ? I 'm small ? What is that ? He 's turned into some kind of nano-mechanical organism . Nano-mech. I like it . Just like the chips . Time to get small . Even smaller . This is gross ! Listen to my voice . You must obey . You 're one of us now , Ben Tennyson . Aaaargh ! Run ! How can you care about the humans , when the universe is yours ? No ! You 're different from these other drones . Stronger ! Together , we can rule everything ! Sorry , I 'm just not ready for a serious commitment . Then you 'll die ... with the humans . Ow ! What 's Ben doing in there ? Whatever he 's doing , he 'd better hurry up . The chips are activating . You were a fool to transform into a drone . I can easily defeat any puny drone . I 'm not just any drone ! I 'm half-drone , half-human ! Drones can adapt . And humans never give up . Oh ! He did it ! - Dad ! - Elena . He 's alright ! What am I , chopped liver ? Hello , I just saved the world again . Don 't look at me . I 'm not hugging you . Actually , you might not wanna hug me so tight . I flew through a lot of snot . Max ! Max ! Max , where are you ? ! Grandpa ! You 've got a lot of gall ... disobeying orders , defying my authority . Grandpa , I ... You know what that kind of behavior gets you ? ! I 'm sorry , Victor . None of this would have ever happened if I had trusted you . No , Max , it wasn 't right to go it alone . Ben , thank you . I 'm forever grateful . You should be thanking your daughter . If it wasn 't for Elena , I 'd be at a school football game right now . He 's just being modest . Ben , modest ? lmpossible . I guess we make a pretty good team . We make a great team . We 're more than that , we 're Plumbers . And the Plumbers have a pretty great leader . Indeed they do . Ben , what would you say if I asked you to step in ? What ? Well , I 'm not getting any younger . And believe me , I 've been waiting for this moment long enough . I couldn 't take over . You already have , in a way . That Omnitrix could have gone to anybody 's wrist . We just count ourselves lucky that it found yours . I hate to say it , but Max is right . Can we at least get a 30-day trial period ? Well , my first order of business will be to unaccept Max 's resignation . Sorry , you 're not getting out of it that easy . Well , maybe you 're right . What in blazes did that zombie me do with my ride ? What did you mean when you said , " we 're a great team " ? You are not on the team . I am now , red . I earned my place , and I suggest you move your locker far away from mine . Oh , I don 't think so ... You better get used to that . It 's the sound of things to come . Now give me back my keys . Nice try , Kev . But from now on , I 'm driving . I call shotgun .

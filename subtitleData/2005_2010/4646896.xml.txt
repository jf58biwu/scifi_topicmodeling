 I 'm thirsty ! - Emergency services . - Gerda Larsen calling . My scooter 's fucked . - ID number ? - My ID number ? It 's 130147 1632 . I 'm on Highway 261 , 6 kilometres from the harbour . - How long will you be ? - Two minutes . Two minutes ? - That 's pretty damn quick ... - Stay where you are . How rude ! Gerda Larsen , 130147 1632 , has been successfully detained . Everyone in the school yard stay calm ! You have been detained under Section 17.3 of the Martial Law Act . Those with blue ribbons will shortly be escorted to classrooms . I repeat ... - Where are we going ? - You 'll soon find out . - Gerda ! - Kitty ? They 've rounded us all up . What about Big Frank ? He 's lying over there . I repeat ... Fucking army cunts ! Let us out and feed us something apart from rice ! We know our rights ! I haven 't done anything ! - All clear ? - All clear . Let us out . - Hey , cunt , let us out . - You 'll be interviewed soon . Listen to me ... Let me talk to the bloke in charge . - Fuck your interviews . - Chill . - Shut your face . - Now , now . I know your type . You know fuck all , you fat cow . Look , the old lady 's crying . Are you OK ? - I haven 't done anything . - None of us has done anything . My son 's a UN soldier in Africa , helping the little black sambos . - All clear . - Let go of me ! Let go of me , you Nazi poop pusher . Sod off home and fuck your mother . - You got a problem ? - Sit down . Easy , mate . I am sitting down . Detainees at Hilergade School will be served supper at 22.00 hours . Ethnic minorities will be provided with a vegetarian option . This announcement will be repeated in Arabic . What the fuck is that slag doing ? Hello . Good evening . My name is Sidse , and I 'm from the Mandela rebels . Any of you heard of us ? No . Hello , I 'm Ole Høgh Pedersen . And this is a complete mistake . I shouldn 't be here at all . Mistake ? I shouldn 't be here either . Hound , cease this endless bark of thine ! See 'st thou not thy master on the brine ? Ole , give me a moment . - Young lady ! - Don 't lecture me ! I have fought for the left wing for 30 years . I have my contacts . We haven 't much time . You must listen to me if you want to get out alive . What are you on about ? You are to be exterminated for failing to contribute to society . Are you taking the piss or are you just stupid ? - I don 't understand ... - Are you taking the piss ? Shut it ! - You want to die ? - Please ... stop it ... Stop that ! Your interviews will begin in a moment . I can help you survive the next 12 hours . I was in the home guard . Sorry , being in the home guard is a parameter for selection . I helped defend Denmark from the Communists . It 's only because of the left wing that there is a minimum wage . We fight for the little man . The home guard made sure we didn 't end up like the GDR . This is crazy . What am I doing here ? I 'm going to tell the guard there 's a crazy bitch in here who says we 're going to be executed . Trust me . Lots of your friends have already been killed . Guards ! - All clear ? - All clear . Yes ? What do you want ? Nothing . We 're ready for the first one . Dennis Henriksen . Yes . Come with me . No ! I want to say goodbye ! Just two minutes ! Cut it out ! Dennis , come with me . I 'm allowed to say goodbye . Two minutes . OK . Two minutes . OK ... Right ... Tell me your qualifications . Well , I 've got a few convictions for assault . This is not going to be easy . Talk about your place in the world . Tell them that in prison , you read about Apollo and the Cosmos . It made you think about yourself . - And your life . - Greek mythology ? You can 't simplify it in those terms . I did philosophy at university . So if you want to debate the issue ! The Cosmos is the world about us . In this world , we all have a place , and we need to know what it is . What a pair of idiots ! Yes , indeed . Shut your face . Apollo 's believers thought they were inferior beings . Tell them it 's your philosophy , too . You 'll never become prime minister or an estate agent with the cards fate has dealt you . But you now see a chance to use your background and unique experience to help others like you . Get it ? I reckon . Say it back to me . Dennis , come along . Kick arse , Dennis ! Jerk them off , you little poof ! Let go of me ! Hello . My name is Folke Rasmussen . Folke ? As in Volkswagen ? You might say so . I am not the interviewer ; I 'm from Parliament . You are a Social Democrat MP . You were on the committee that drew up the bill better known as the New Copenhagen Criteria . Major Christian Andersen . I always spend the first 24 hours with the new detainees . I learned something interesting tonight , Folke . It turns out that there is an underground army . They call themselves Mandela . One of their representatives has infiltrated tonight 's detainees . She wants to help them , Folke . Give them advice . Feed them lies about their lives and achievements . You know the rules , right ? I am the interviewer . I ask the questions . You are the external examiner . And I have the final say . Folke , listen . We want it to be quick and painless . - You voted for the bill . - Quite so . Come in . Are you ready for the first one ? It 's the girl from the rebels . - No , let 's start with Ole . - Ole Høgh Pedersen ? - Precisely . - Ole Høgh ? Do you know him ? That lefty artist . Ex Arts Foundation board . Yes , he 's the one . Artists often make our red lights flash . Low incomes , usually combined with substance abuse of some kind . It 's part of their work , really . So we agree . Yes . We 'll get him sorted . It won 't take long . And , Jensen , Gerda , the fatso in the wheelchair , check out her son . She says he works for the UN in Africa . - Will you be coming tomorrow , too ? - No . I asked Claus if I could sit in just for today . You are very interested in social policy , so I read . - You read that ? - Indeed , I did . Come in ! Ole , come on in . I 'm Major Christian Andersen . I 'm the interviewer today , observed by Folke Rasmussen , M. P. Hi , Ole . I remember you . There 's been some kind of mistake . It 's a mockery of human rights . Take it easy , Ole . I was telling Folke that it 's bizarre how often the lives of artists resemble those of the people we 're really after . But I worked for the Arts Foundation . I 'm practically an Art Academy graduate . I lectured there . I apologize . A mistake has been made . Your low income and chronic health problems rang the alarm bell . I certainly haven 't been lucky health-wise , I can tell you . You 're not to blame for that , Ole . - Right , Folke ? - Quite so . Can we offer you a lift home ? Yes , sure . Yes , please . Cheerio then . See Jensen about it at the door . Ole , what actually happened at the Art Foundation ? I 'm curious , that 's all . I was a consultant . But the management were so conservative . Oh , yes ! I remember ! Those huge grants you awarded yourself . An absurd accusation . So you didn 't ? I did all kinds of things , damn it , as you well know . I am not one of them . - Ole , sit down again for a moment . - Come off it . It 'll only take a minute . Let 's find a reason to let you go . Our red lights are flashing , see . You received quite a bit from the state . And our computers don 't visit art galleries . Take off your jacket and sit down . No , I don 't suppose they do . Ole , you 've received over a million in grants . To create works of art for ? Yes . Or ... to explore ... Art is a form of exploration ... Not just results , Christian . I set up a pottery school for the rural unemployed . It says here that the local authority put 2 million into it . It was meant to house 200 jobless . But Ole ... You fell ill , and the project was abandoned . No jobless people ever made it there , did they ? You said I wasn 't to blame for my poor health . - Which was due to alcohol . - Christian ! It was my daughter . She ... She killed herself . I tell you , I was beside myself . I just couldn 't cope . - I was on the ropes . - How awful ! Was she living with you or her mum ? Mostly with my mum . She grew up with her granny ? We were travelling so much . - It wasn 't anything for a kid . - The Socialist High School ... Yes , the sneaky bastards ! Of course , we didn 't know at the time . Ole , tell me what you 've created so I can let you go . You 've cost the state a fortune . Far more than all the people in the waiting room together . Now you 're on a disability allowance , but you 're still applying for grants . Just name a work of yours . Folke and I don 't mind which ; we 're no art experts . Give me a couple of days . To think . - I can 't concentrate in this heat . - I don 't get you . Why not mention the sculpture for the City of Roskilde ? All right , let me mention that then . Or perhaps my files will tell me why not ? " Petersen sculpture removed after two months . " The artist said it represented " the sick , sharp end of capitalism . " It was removed " after a 10-year-old girl poked her eye out " on one of its many spikes while she was playing nearby . She was the third child to be hurt like that . " Art isn 't for playing on . In a playground ? Don 't give me that ! I 'm having my doubts . I was ready to let you go . But your only work of art poked a little girl 's eye out . You only got the commission because your dad was a city councillor . You have not paid a penny in tax on your fee . What can I say ? Help me ! But we agree , don 't we , Folke ? Yes . Christian ... Christian ... Ole Høgh Petersen , by the powers vested in me by the Martial Law Act , I sentence you to death for neglecting your civil duties and responsibility to society . No ! Come in . No need to take him out . Just pop him into the teddy-bear corner . Let the others see we mean business . Clean up the chair and table . - You are completely crazy ! - Oh , stop it ! If you can 't butcher pigs , you can 't eat sausages . I 'm a country boy . The law says it 's meant to be humane . " By injection incompatible with life . " " Or any means military command deems necessary . " No buts . We agreed , right , Folke ? And I am the military command . He would have cried his eyes out all the way to the basement . But now it 's over . I won 't do it again if you 're so fussy . Did you throw up ? John and Nancy Frandsen , brother and sister , as you probably know , we 've decided to get rid of a good deal of the population . Nobody knows who thought of it first . Perhaps it was a politician or a civil servant in an ice-cream queue with his grandchild . Perhaps he found himself waiting behind a group of obese drunks and their offspring . Perhaps he followed them , saw them climb drunkenly into their car and jotted down the number just as the father slapped his little boy for spilling ice cream . The next day in the office , he came across the car number and did a search . The mother was on the records as living on her own . Perhaps he grew obsessed by this family and began to spy on them . He discovered the mum and dad cohabiting while drawing single-person 's allowances . At the local playground he discovered the mother was a child-minder . Unregistered , of course , and that 's despite the bad back , for which she claims a disability allowance . The father is always getting at the little boy , who terrorizes other kids and has a full-time special-needs teacher . The father works the door at the local discotheque . He sends numerous young people to hospital every weekend . Finally , our civil servant asks himself : " Why are these people alive ? What is their purpose here ? " What good will they ever do ? " In what way will they ever enrich the world we live in ? " Somehow the New Copenhagen Criteria were committed to paper , based on hard , irrefutable data culled from the enormous volume of details on every single citizen revealing the greatest drain on the treasury . It turned out that quite a small percentage of the population accounts for most of the social spending . Hospital beds , special-needs teachers , drug rehab , children 's homes , respite schemes , housing allowances , debt cancelling . Home helps , substance abuse , prison cells . What started as a fantasy went against the flow through industrial federations , trade unions . The movers and shakers got to hear of it . Slowly but surely , a consensus formed . " Let 's exterminate them all . " " In one go ! " " In the summer , while good , family Denmark is away on holiday . " " But the problems are still there ! Use the schools and the army ! " " Declare a state of emergency , and get the problem over and done with ! " John , let 's begin with you . John ... Yes . You were picked up at the airport on your return from ... - John ? - Thailand . Yes , that 's right . With two Thai girls , one of 18 , one of 16 . They weren 't with me . We just got talking . You run a striptease club . Yes , but it 's only ... the girls who work for us , we treat like our own children . We give them a roof over their heads . They have days off . It 's up to them who they sleep with . Yes . We cut the number of rapists and crazies with nowhere else to go . Ah , social work ? Interesting . Go on . That 's how it is , right ? Men ... Men need ... Pussy . Cultivated language is not a prerequisite . - Men need pussy or they go mad . - Get desperate . Insane . Murder . Rape . What if your own daughter got raped one night ? You 'd have been grateful if the man had had somewhere else to take his hard-on . Visit the topless bar and avoid eight years for rape ? Yes . You could put it that way . Nancy ... have you ever serviced these potential killer rapists ? No . For God 's sake , no ! No ? Because that 's kind of the twist that 's lacking from John 's reasoning . Let 's talk about you , Nancy . You were picked up at ... What does it say ... The Sealand Private Clinic for Beauty and Recreation . So it does ! Another name for a cosmetic-surgery clinic , right ? Yes . They didn 't pick you up in mid-operation , I hope ? Regrettable . They do get a bit impatient . But their workload is enormous . Your breasts , you say . Were they tired from too much nursing ? No . It says here you had a baby . It was an accident . Why did you put the baby up for adoption ? So you did ... What about the father ? - What about him ? - Yes ... who is he ? Some bloke . I don 't know . It was dark . It was dark in hillbilly country . Adoption isn 't illegal . That really is your theme , John . Legal . Illegal . Moving in the grey area between the two poles . Crossing the borderline and scurrying back with your prey . But today is not about the legislation you have been exploiting . Today is about your value as human beings . Are you worth anything ? It wasn 't a rhetorical question . Are you worth anything ? Of course we are worth something . We 're human beings . What are you worth ? What have you given the world ? - Your baby , for example ? - But I had him adopted . I don 't quite follow you either , Folke . Having a baby you can 't care for is no achievement . Is there nothing ... Anything will do . There 's our ... philosophy . Yes ? Go on ? Have you ever heard of Dionysus ? - Dionysus ? The Greek god ? - Yes , him . Anyway . It 's about pleasure . Right . Get me ? No . We are put here on this earth . We are all human beings . - We are all here for pleasure . - Yes . Pleasure . Yes . Like our topless bar . It 's a place of pleasure . One day we 'll all be gone , and the only thing that 'll count is whether we were happy . Right ? - Very good , eh , Christian ? - Yes , fabulous . Sidse found the only god you could mention with a clear conscience . I don 't know anyone called Sidse . John is in his element . A tiny hole just big enough for him to wriggle through . - But it 's our ... life ... - Our philosophy of life . Sidse from Mandela . You are in your final hour . Yet you choose to tell lies . We don 't know that . I was there . But I wasn 't , and I 'm the examiner . John and Nancy have an idea . A consistent pattern of existence based on a faith . Jensen ! Sidse , or whatever she calls herself , she 's next . We must stop her , or she 'll coach them all . And we 'll spend the next two weeks discussing myths and philosophy . - Anything else ? - No . Let 's finish these two off . Nancy , what gives you pleasure ? My big , firm breasts . Men gaping . Desire . Yes , and I enjoy my pleasure palace , the topless bar . You should try it . I 'll buy you a drink . Thank you , John . We 've got the message ; your philosophy is pleasure . But the cult of Dionysus was more than botox and silicone . They rode out into the night . They lived in an orgiastic pact with nature . - But times have changed . - They certainly bloody have . And I may also add that the girls enjoy their freedom . - There are no losers . - The tax collector . The rest of the population who slave away to pay their taxes . Oh , like builders and plumbers ? Have you got them on your list ? If I 'm going to die because a few girls forget to pay their taxes , those cowboys should die , too . They do so much work for cash . John and Nancy Frandsen , thank you . Jensen ? Take the cult of Dionysus back . Was that it then ? - Come on . - Let 's come to an arrangement . There must be some way ... - They weren 't so hopeless . - They 'd been brainwashed . So you say . Why would I lie ? But I have the final say . Sergeant ! Are there any vacant classrooms ? Yes . Nature studies . We 'll move . I 'm fed up with the sight of that dead potter . He stinks . No ! Stop it ! Fucking gay bastard ! Let go ! Fuck you ! Your mum sucks cocks in hell . - Come in . - Fucking Nazi queer ! You think you can feel me up free of charge ? Hi , Sidse . I 'll see to her . We meet again . Come and sit down . The game 's over , so just sit down . - Is he talking to me ? - Stop playing about . My name isn 't Sidse . Oh ? What is it then ? Belinda . Shall I spell it out on the blackboard ? Sit down , Belinda . I can 't have you executed if you don 't meet the criteria . But I can have you put in prison . Get it ? A pathetic little lefty . You make me sick . You 're not to bright . The name 's Belinda ; I just said . BE spells " be , " LIN spells " lin , " DA spells " duh . " Belinda Jacobsen ? Right on ! Fucking clever ! Ten out of ten . You 're playing a dangerous game . Right . Where were you picked up ? Down the mall . What were you doing there ? Bashing ethnics . " Bashing ethnics " ? Like , a crowd of us gets together and shares a few beers . It 's real nice . And we looks out for ethnics . If we sees a real ugly one , we follows after her and pisses all over her and then beats her up . It 's people like you . That 's why I voted for the bill . Those darkies are a fucking pest . They 're always on the fiddle and infecting us with lice and tuberculosis . There are doctors among them . People who 've completed university , who 've had to flee their homes , and now do the jobs you are too lazy for . " Lazy " ? Belinda 's on disability benefit . There is nothing wrong with you . You are a parasite who despises and makes life a misery for the " new Danes " who do the jobs you are too lazy to do . And you laugh ! - Nigger lover ! - You are going to die ... Folke , let 's take a break . " Volkswagen ! " - Nip out and hug an ethnic . - It 's just the heat . Who are you ? It 's only a matter of time before we unravel your underground army . Tricking Folke won 't do it . Tell me your name , and you can go . You 're not just some young activist . Just a moment . It 's me , Folke . I 'll find out who you are , don 't worry . I have heard enough to make a decision . Jensen ? Take her back to the others . We can despatch her at once as far as I 'm concerned . She 's got to die . Where are you going ? To find Belinda Jacobsen . Cut it out . - Your tits are bleeding . - Watch your lip . Fuck me , your tits are bleeding . - John ? John ! - John , you might have told me ! Her tits are bleeding . Your tits are falling off . - This is it . - What ? - I need the toilet . - For fuck 's sake . It 's not my fault I need a shit . I 'll give you a hand . I did my vocational training looking after people like you . - What do I do ? - Pull my pants down . - That 's fucking disgusting . - Come on . - Someone 's got to help her . - I 'll do it . Move that chair ! John , don 't just sit there . Come and help . She 's too fat . Lend a hand , China . - No way . - You want her to shit on the floor ? You are too stupid for words . For fuck 's sake ! Come on , John , you old-home help , you ! Nice one , John . Nice one , John ... For God 's sake ... - What are you staring at ? - You . What are you staring at ? - All clear ? - All clear . Let go . That really hurts . What ? Chill , man . I am sitting down . All your talk of Greek gods and your stupid rescue plan ! There 's a dead Commie upstairs . The plan is working . Folke doesn 't believe Christian . - I 've finished . - Stay there . On the toilet ? If you need another dump . - The other bloke 's more on our side . - Precisely . I gave it all I 've got and played my part so well that Folke went crazy . Your part ? Yes , as Belinda . Your part as us , right ? Don 't you lot get it ? She could be on their side . She isn 't . I 've been upstairs . - I know a bit more than you . - Like how to get us out ? Like how to get us out ? Sit down , John . Do you know how to get us out ? No ? So shut your trap . China , are you crazy ? Listen ! Do as I say . Right now we 're trapped at the top of a blazing skyscraper . Like fuck we are . - It 's a metaphor . - No , it isn 't . I 've seen it . It 's the one where the old lady dies . - I don 't want to die . - It was only a film . We 'll all get out alive . Christian will try to make you tell him who I am . You mustn 't . Stick to my story . I 'm Belinda Jacobsen , an ex junkie . - Folke has the final say . - It 's the immigrants who started it . - Shut up , Nancy ! - Not us at all . No , it is you . It is you . You all meet a large number of the New Copenhagen Criteria . - How big are these criteria ? - What ? How large are these criteria ? They 're a long list of things , Melanie ; very complicated . Why not just say them ? We don 't really have time . We want to hear them , bitch . Watch your language ! - Calm down , China ! - Stay out of this , John . OK . The New Copenhagen Criteria , Criterion 1 : Those who have been on welfare for years or on other benefits , with the exception of the old-age pension . Criterion 2 : Those who have deliberately defrauded society by moonlighting , forging benefit claims , evading taxes . Criterion 3 : Abuse of drugs , alcohol , etc . Criterion 4 : Those who use the health service far more than average . Criterion 5 : Those who cannot care for their own children . Criterion 6 : Those out of work for unusually long . Criterion 7 : Those who have lived on the edge of the law for years , even if they 've never been convicted . The list is long . The system compares what each citizen has cost to what the state derives from him , tangible or intangible , to see if he has fulfilled his contract with society . Are people to die just for being on disability allowances ? - It 's not my fault ! - No , Gerda . Fulfilling a single criterion is not enough . If the individual can present something , anything , to show that he or she has made a genuine contribution ... How can you remember all that ? It 's not that difficult . I wrote them . There aren 't any more . - We 've cleaned out the docks . - 270889 1422 Belinda Jacobsen . - Belinda Jacobsen ? - Where is her flat ? Block 57 , 3rd floor , on the right . Come back here ! Sit down . 270889-1422 Belinda Jacobsen . She isn 't here . She escaped . Are you the leader of Mandela ? I have a girl in my custody . Sidse . Part of this group . I 'm willing to release her , but she insists she is Belinda Jacobsen . - She set sail yesterday . - Where to ? Every country in Europe is following our example . We 're going to Africa . Africa ! For goodness sake ! Unless I can persuade the examiner that she 's Sidse , she 'll die . - I can 't help you . - Yes , you can . Or you 'll die , pal , and I 'll take the lot of you to the camp . But if you help me , I 'll give you all till tomorrow night to leave for Africa . So think again . I 'll count to three . 1 , 2 ... - 3 ... - Wilken Andersen . Sidse Wilken Andersen . - Shut up ! - Isn 't that what you wanted to know ? That 's the difference between them and us . You risk your life for them ; they 'll say anything to save their arses . It 's me . Sidse Wilken Andersen . Look her up while I wait . I must seem like the bogeyman who stole your PlayStation , TV , your Big Mac and your chips . But Africa will be the best thing that 's ever happened to you . You 'll live in the desert or the jungle . You and your mum and dad will learn how to cope for yourselves . - Are you looking forward to it ? - Fuck you . I see . Right . Interesting . Mind you don 't accidentally use a bad word . Right away . And her mother . - When do you sail ? - Tonight . I 'll make sure you can get out of Danish territorial waters . Bon voyage . And thanks for your help . - We 'll swap her . - I 'm not sure , China . But she 's our only hope . China , Stop ! What good will it do ? They won 't execute Sidse in our place . She doesn 't meet any of their stupid criteria . She 's breaking the law . Maybe . But that 's only one criterion . And you heard her . You have to fulfil more than one . She 's upper-class and educated . It 's because of her we 're going to die . - Not for certain . - I am going to . - I meet almost all their criteria . - I 've finished . - Shut up ! - You heard her . They expect to release the 7 percent who 've achieved something . - What ? What ? - Hey , I don 't know . Fucking great , John . That really helped . She made sure there was a loophole in case they found a genius among us . - Nobody else can help us . - We 're not to blame . There was this lady at social services who said to me once : " Melanie , forgive yourself . It 's not your fault " . - That 's what we have to tell them . - No , it isn 't . - You are so stupid . - Untie her , John . No ! No fucking way . You 're going to die , Sidse , you cunt . Is your name still Belinda Jacobsen ? He was about to kill you , right ? Tell Folke your real name . Belinda . Belinda Jacobsen . Are you fucking brain-dead ? Folke wants to check that you 're being held in decent conditions . Hello , friends . Are you ... - Are you being fed properly ? - Like fuck . All we get is rice and greens and stupid fruit juice . - Heard enough ? - Yes . Cut Sidse ... sorry , Belinda ... down . If one of you would help Gerda Larsen off the toilet and into her chair ... She 's next . Income tax will be cut by 30 per cent . I hear they 're interning them . Well , it won 't damage your market share ; they weren 't church-goers . Good evening . Is Bishop Andersen there ? Excuse me , there are some soldiers outside asking for you . Soldiers ? - What 's all this ? - William Andersen ? Bishop ? - Please come with us . - Not on your life ! How dare you ! What 's going on ? Inge Wilken ? You are also to be detained . Under the Martial Law Act . What nonsense is this ? There must be some misunderstanding . Josefine ? Take these young chaps down to the kitchen for a bite of supper ... Please come with me . We 're not going anywhere . What the devil ! Hell , I 'm a bishop , I 'm a bishop . Hands off ! I 'll phone Abrahamsen right away . You 'll be back by midnight . Gerda Larsen . Always on welfare or a disability allowance . It 's my hip . It just wouldn 't ... But you had expensive surgery . A fat lot of good that did . " The patient 's serious alcohol abuse " is impairing her functionality . " For surgery to be of any benefit , she must refrain from drinking . " But for the last three weeks , she has consumed no solids . " She will require monitoring on discharge . " But I 've hardly had a drink for ages . No ? This is what you were carrying . A receipt from Aldi . Twelve export lagers , a bottle of rum , sliced white bread , a sticky cake . Gerda ... that wasn 't doctor 's orders , was it ? You live in sheltered accommodation . The state has kept you all your life . - You have given nothing back . - That 's not true ! Oh ? Tell us your contribution then . My son . Despite the frigging hard life I lead , not that you 'd understand , you little lump of shit , I brought ... a son into this world who 's now a UN soldier . He travels the world rescuing little black children . Little black children ! That sounds fantastic ! Where is he now ? He 's not allowed to tell me . Shall we phone him ? - Can you do that ? - Sure . Have you found him ? Poul . Poul Larsen . - Yes . - We found him all right . In Africa , as you said . Listen ... - Hello ? - Yes , hello ? Major Andersen , Copenhagen . - Poul Larsen ? - Yes . - The son of Gerda Larsen ? - Yes . Your assistant has already phoned . Get to the point . Is the old cow dead ? What did you say ? Is she dead ? No . No , not yet . Well , I couldn 't give a fuck whether she 's dead or alive . And I 'm not coming home if that 's why you 're calling . You don 't care if your mum dies ? She never did anything for me . Apart from leaving me to cry while Big Frank shafted her behind the curtain . - Harsh words for a UN soldier . - A what ? Harsh words for a UN soldier . The UN ? A bunch of peace-loving faggots . I 'm not UN , mate . - But your mum says ... - Stop calling her my mum . Fucking hell , they 're coming . Poul ? Poul ? Poul ? Wrap them up and burn them . This one is still alive . He 's just a boy . He 's just a dead boy . Now burn the niggers . Your son works for South Africans who control the diamond mines in Sierra Leone . His job is to shoot the locals if they approach their own mines . He doesn 't give a toss if you die . You have lived off other people 's money all your life . Your son has thousands of lives on his conscience . If he 's got one . That 's the first thing to go if kids are completely neglected . What can I say ? No ! No ! Thank you for coming in at such short notice . Major Andersen ... and our observer , Folke Rasmussen , M. P. , Soc Dem . The Bishop of Roskilde , William Andersen . - What are we doing here ? - And his wife , Inge Wilken . Consultant gynaecologist , the University Hospital . Shall we ? Do come in . - What are we doing here ? - You 've lost me , too . We 'll put that right straight away . Come in . What the fuck 's all this ? Who 's that ? Yes , who 's this ? Your daughter ... what was her name ? What are you on about ? You 're speechless ... isn 't this your daughter ? Sidse Wilken Andersen ... You just can 't take it that I am not this Sidse slag . OK , I have heard of Sidse and her shitty group . It 's her fault we 're going to die . Because she wrote those Copenhagen Criteria . It 's her fault . Then she got cold feet , and now she wants to save us all . I tell you I am not that stupid cow . Get it ? My name 's Belinda . Get that into your pea brain . Sidse Wilken Andersen , justice ministry civil servant . As a joke , she drew up the New Copenhagen Criteria . Perhaps she sorted the state databases according to the criteria . It amazed her what a small proportion of the population cost us all our money . She showed the results to colleagues . And from that moment , it was out of her hands . Appalled by what she had done , she started Mandela , a group of good Samaritans to save the people she had condemned to death . She risked her life to rescue the ones on our lists . But there were too many . It took too long . So she started assuming the IDs of women her own age whom she knew would be picked up at some stage . And here she is . Sidse Wilken Andersen , Folke . It sounds rather fantastic . Is she really your daughter ? It 's hard to imagine ... What ? Inge , isn 't this your daughter ? No . You do realize that your answers may cost her her life ? Unless I can persuade Folke that this is Sidse , she 'll die . See , they 're not my mum and dad . I am in doubt , Christian . I quite understand . You don 't often hear parents condemn their children to death . It is very tiring to hear you of all people talk with such concern about condemning people to death . The people out there in that hell on earth of yours ! Your hell on earth . You and your friends created it , not me . For decades , you have done them the worst disfavour anyone can do . You 've decided they can 't speak for themselves . - They give us our humanity . - For God 's sake ! So they have to live their wretched lives just so you can keep your humanity ? You coward ! The Bible is full of divine intervention to ensure the survival of the species . The banishment from the Garden of Eden , the Fall , Sodom and Gomorra . The ten plagues of Egypt . The list is endless . What Sidse wrote was just the Seven Deadly Sins , the Ten Commandments and Jesus ' words translated into practical terms . It 's in the Bible ! Kill them ! Kill anyone who only lives on charity and the way the third world slaves 17 hours a day for three bowls of rice to make the crap that is these people 's only nourishment . Kill them . - God will surely find His own . - And you are not among them . The last two , China and Melanie ... To observe the 24-hour rule we must process them now . Folke , we 'll interview them next door . Perhaps this trio will see sense in the meanwhile . Just look at you ! Come on , Folke . Sidse ! My darling girl ... Is it true ? Did you write them ? Yes . How could you ? Sidse ? I don 't know , Daddy . It wasn 't meant to be like this . But we 're putting up a fight . Tonight the first ship sails with refugees for Africa . And I 've managed to get loads and loads out of here . But there are so many . And they 're executing them . Yes , many are dying . But I really am trying . Daddy ? Get out of my way ! You must tell him who you are . I am their only hope . But you 'll die . And that won 't help them . I saw the priest leave . For fuck 's sake , Folke ! The French anemone doesn 't belong among the flora danica . Use your head , man ! They 're no fools . China is an expert on flowers . Flowers ? Come in . - Take Sidse back . - Belinda , you mean . Christian ... You very much want to set Belinda free , don 't you ? Perhaps we could ... how shall I put it ... - Perhaps we could swap ? - Swap ? You set one free and I 'll set one free . Who do you want to set free , Folke ? - The mother . - Gerda ? No ! For heaven 's sake no ! That disgusting old cow ! No . Nancy . - No . - Then I can 't imagine " Sidse " ... This isn 't a market , Folke . We don 't deal in souls . It 's none of your perverted political horse trading . - Christian , be sensible . - I am being sensible . I am the only one here with any sense left . Of course you are . I just thought that if we could talk to her again , perhaps we could find some reason to let her go . Is that what you thought ? I am letting you go . Come on in . Christian will be back in a minute . - We have something to say . - No , you mustn 't say any more . I have something to say to you , too . Perhaps while Christian isn 't here . Sit down . Nancy , have you ever wondered what happened to your baby ? Yes . Loads of times . I 'm always wondering how it turned out . - Have you ever tried to find out ? - But you can 't . Only the kid can . It is about time the truth came out . And the truth ... - Right then . Let 's finish off ! - We were talking about the truth . The truth ? How interesting ! Folke seems to see depths in you that completely evade me . So do tell . - Yes . - Sit down , John . We grew up near a tiny village . In the country , right ? - And ? - Our dad wasn 't exactly ... - Your wretched origins won 't help . - Let her finish , damn it ! Thank you . We lived on a farm , and Mum and Dad weren 't around much . We looked after ourselves . Right , John ? Yes ... We had a younger sister . But she 's dead now . But back then , we looked after her . We were a kind of mum and dad to her . So it was only natural that we began sleeping together . - Shut up , Nancy ! - I got pregnant . - At first we didn 't tell anyone . - Shut up ! Go on . But my belly swelled . And it was too late for an abortion . We lied , of course , and said it was someone I 'd bumped into . - I don 't follow ... - My God ! - John 's the father ! - What ? Do you see now ? The sight of the baby revolted me . I looked for defects . His eyes were weird . His legs were too short . His nose was too long . He reminded us of everything you 'd done wrong . But then I thought : " He 's a sweet kid . He 's got arms and legs . " Maybe someone out there will be able to love him . " I couldn 't . It was simply so disgusting . Nancy , take it easy , OK ? But it 's something , right ? Isn 't it , Mr. Folke ? - I just wanted the best for the kid . - Yes . It is something . You saved a baby from loveless childhood . Folke ! What are you doing ? You are dreadful , dreadful people . I understand you less and less . I am a degenerate ! - You 're certainly clumsy . - My goodness ... is it you ? Dreadful , dreadful people . - Look what you 've done to me ! - John , say hello to your son . A real family get-together ! Bloody hell ! I knew you had a hidden agenda . - I want to go home . - Quite possibly . But the observers also have to attend the executions . You volunteered . It 's an important job . You knew your mother was here ; that was why you came . Let 's go and check the lists . - The lists ? - To decide who goes free . None of them . They 're animals . Kill them all ! Let 's see . Come on . - All clear ? - All clear . I shall now deliver the verdicts . Hans Peter Hansen , a.k.a. China , you are sentenced to death . I didn 't know your name was Hans Peter . John Frandsen . Yes . You are sentenced to death . Melanie Jensen Hansen . - Yes . - You are sentenced to death . - Now it 's my turn . - Stop crying . Nobody 's to cry . Gerda Larsen . You are sentenced to death . Ole Høgh Pedersen . Oh no . Nancy Frandsen . - Yes . - You are sentenced to death . And Belinda Jacobsen . You are sentenced to death . - You will be fetched at dawn . - Thanks a bunch . - It 's just like that film , man . - About the skyscraper ? No , these dickheads up some mountain . My dad was mad about it . - What was it about ? - Dickheads up a mountain . A kind of fort . They ended up there on the run . The enemy built a mega-fucking ramp to reach them . Then on their last night , they all killed themselves . You lot think you can get to us because you 're the biggest . But you have no say at all . They slit their wrists . Men , women , kids , they all died . - What are you saying ? - He 's mad . - I 'm not mad . - You mean do like they did ? No . There must be a way out . Maybe they 'll change their minds . We 're going to die . Will we get gravestones ? Yes , the funeral is the same as any other . - Beautiful . - We 'll just die , China . No ! All our lives , we 've been nothing but shit . But today ... we 're going to show up on equal terms with the others . And how ? Go on , tell me ! You know how ! By taking our own lives before they do . - It 's pathetic . - It 's brilliant . - I don 't want to die . - This is mad . Say something , Sidse . She 's said enough . This is about us . The others always told us what to do because we didn 't know . " Stand over there , China . No , not there . " Whack , and on I went to my next beating . " Do this , be that ! Up yours ! " But we just didn 't have . They couldn 't see it . - We just couldn 't fucking do it . - You 're right , China . " Why are you worthless ? " " Duh ... " " We don 't know . " " OK , in that case , you 'll have to die . " What ? Die ! Eh , John ? Do we have to die ? - No . Like heck we do . - Like heck we do . - We 're going to live . - But we 're going to die . I don 't get it . Any of it . Would you do it , too , Sidse , if it was you ? My name 's not fucking Sidse . Are you with us , Belinda ? Belinda 's on top . Is everyone in ? I 'm in . Fuck them . Me , too . - How about it , John ? - Yes . What ? I 'm in . And Gerda ? Are you ? OK . But only because I don 't want to be left here alone for two hours . China ! We must leave them a letter . To tell them what it signifies , why we 're doing it . - And that we get the last laugh . - A farewell letter . A farewell letter . Who 's going to write it ? Sidse , you write it . Belinda , I mean . This is how it 'll start . " To the world ... " - Are you ready ? - Yes . You haven 't changed your mind regarding Sidse and your mother ? My mother is Mette Rasmussen . She brought me up . Shall we go ? On the count of three . Ready ? Yes . 1 , 2 , 3 ... Sailing up the river Sailing down again Wasn 't that just a lovely song Amazing how we get along Sailing up the river Sailing down again Wasn 't that just a lovely song Amazing how we get along Up the river ... OK ... who 's going to jump first ? - Me . - No , you 've got to read the letter . - Right . Belinda reads the letter . - And then you jump ? Yes , Belinda reads and then she jumps . - Promise ? - Cross my heart and hope to die . - OK , I 'll jump . - No ! Wait ! Wait ! Let 's go at the same time . - China ? - OK . - China , count to three . - When I say " now . " Ready ? - Ready ? - Yep . OK . Yep . 1 , 2 , 3 , now . OK , Gerda . Are you up for it ? I don 't want to ! I don 't want to ! I just want to get over all this . I want to make up for everything . I want to go home . Think of something else . Close your eyes . Close your eyes ! Think of ... Fuck it , man ! Think of pizza . Jump ! Well , then Belinda pussy , it 's Chinaboy 's turn . Heck ... I 'm starting to sweat after all . I 'd better jump . - Goodbye . - No , wait . You 're all right . Shut the fuck up , you fat cow . They 're coming . You 'll never get me ! Stop ! Don 't move ! Don 't come any closer ! Belinda has something to say . " To the world : " When you read this letter , we will all be gone . " Because we tricked you . " We want to say two things . " Do unto others as you would do unto him . " And hell Hitler . " No ! No ! Mummy ! I am so sorry . This is intolerable . It 's a bloody opera . You ... You monster . That 'll do . Run along home , Folke . It 's got to stop . I will put a stop to it . Out of my way . That 's an order . - What do you intend to do ? - Set up a parliamentary committee . - The next lot is waiting outside . - Just take the lads with you . It 's gone too far . This wasn 't the idea . Perhaps it 's a good thing if it ends here . What 's the idea ? You 're mad . You 'll cost the state a fortune when your hereditary defects break out . Folke , it 's only a matter of time . Folke ! For fuck 's sake ... Folke . Folke , come along . Folke , your mum and dad died rather more stylishly . Apparently , it only gets worse the more degenerate you are ... Folke ... Wow ! See ? It isn 't that difficult . Christian is getting the last ones sorted . He 'll be out in a minute . What are we doing here ? Shut up and stay in two lines . What are you at , you fucking dickhead ? - Hi there ! - Hi . Hey , we 've arrived ! We 're in Africa ! Look ! Africa 's just over there ! Come on ! Be a bit sociable ! Africa .

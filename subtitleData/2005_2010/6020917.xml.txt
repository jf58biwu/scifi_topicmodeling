And solve a super cool mystery ? You 're a short giant . Aren 't you , like , 30 feet tall in the books ? If you think I 'm a disappointment , you should see Clifford . He 's like those little dogs rich ladies drag around . Plus he 's more pink than red . Anyway ... the magic flashlight shall lead the way ! Stupid f ... enchanted batteries . Follow me ! After we save the Venture family , I say we take this thing to Aruba ! And you all laughed at my speedos . I 'm not sure how to fly this . Put the coordinates from your magic crystals into the jet 's flight computer ! I can 't do that ! I can 't even find the other end of this seat belt ! I can 't help you not save the Ventures ... from back here in the kiddie seat . Why is creepo get to be the co-pilot ? I wasn 't the one who materialized him from a trading card . Point of order , I wanted to kill him ... because I bet he 's an abomination or something . And isn 't there some code about that ? Unless he 's made from dead people , it is still considered murder . Nice try . Got it ! It was all crammed into the cushion . What if he gets hit by a car and he 's half-dead ? I had this dog once that never ... I hope he knows where we are going . I hope he couldn 't understand what I said about him . We have to get her back ! We have to rescue her ! Daddy 's coming , baby ! What are you , crazy ? Scratch that . You 're a lunatic . There 's an armada of Guild WASPs out there ... waiting to spank our ass ! - Now , this thing flies , right ? - She is the pride of the poison skies . Then fire her up and show me what this ... cocoon can do . You ! You got weapons in this place ? Yeah . Armory 's fully stocked . We just came back from south of the border .

And thanks . Minions ! Prepare to launch ! That 's my seat , jackass ! And what is this ? What is this ? ! That 's for the reception ! Sorry . Get off of me ! You creepy jerk . What are you , anyway ? ! What are you supposed to be from the future ? And you , would you put a shirt on , for God 's sakes ? Where do you get off siccing your two stooges on me ? I vasn 't in The Stooges . Just saving you from a life of regret , my dear . Not to mention a fiery grave at the bottom of the Grand Canyon . Now , what say you slip out of that tacky little white lie ... put on your Queen Etherea costume ... and take your rightful place by my side ? Is everybody delusional today ? What do you think the Sovereign will do to you when he finds out ... you borrowed his entire army to fight your lovers ' quarrel ? You 'll throw away your whole career just to get back at The Monarch ? Over me ? If you 'd shown half as much passion , during the ... What the f ... do those creeps keep laughing at ? Well , I suspect the Sovereign will be quite all right with it . You see ... you 're looking at him . Strangers ! Attack ! - Engines online ! - Book ! So , it 's a cocoon ... that flies . - Obviously . - I just realized that makes no sense . Duh ! Monarch ? Butterfly ? Butterfly , cocoon ? - It 's a theme thing . - Yeah . I get it , but why didn 't you just make it shaped like a butterfly ? Because that 's gay ? All right . With a show of hands , how many of you are suicidal ? OK , now , how many of you love change ? - Here he comes , boys ! - Oh , thank God ! Now , I want you to give our new commander ... all the respect you were supposed to give 24 . Listen up ! I know that ... I have beat on most of you in the past ... - I forgive you , Brock Samson ! - I was asking for it ! I love you , Brock Samson ! ... but we have to put all that aside , and focus on getting Dr. Girlfriend back . Now , God knows , a child could take you guys one on one ... We do the best we can . We try . ... but as a swarm , even you guys can be dangerous ! Welcome to Big Boy Town ! As of this moment , you are no longer butterflies ! Today , you are murderflies ! In one decisive blow , we go for the head ... cut it off , and watch the body die ! We all fly for Phantom Limb 's command ship ! - What ? - We don 't have anything to fly in . We just have a Monarch Mobile and a Nissan Stanza . You all have wings . Yeah , these are for showin ' , not for blowing ' . No way ! They work ! What ? Total gyp ! Why didn 't anybody tell us these things worked ? ! - This changes everything . - I wanna come with ! I wanna help ! Not this time , Hank . It 's too dangerous . Come on , let me at ' em , Brock ! I probably know judo ! How many of those guys can make the same boast ? No . Why must you be the screen door on my submarine , Brock ? The answer 's no , Hank ! Now go find your brother and hide under something heavy . And there came a savior to our world . And he was known as Dean . Dean the brave . Though only a child himself , it has been prophesied ... that he will free the enslaved orphans of Insectia . Giant Boy Detective , show me this mighty warrior you speak of . OK . But don 't be judgmental . - You must keep an open mind . - I always do . - You 're kidding , right ? - You 're the one who 's always judgmental . Are you insane ? ! You 're always like " Hey , fella ... " you might wanna roll up the windows in this neighborhood . " - Am I doing it now ? - No , but ... Then show me the friggin ' warrior already ! - Behind the little kid ? - See ? You always do this . What ? ! I 'm not being judgmental ! I 'm making a judgment ! - There is a huge difference ... - This is just stupid ! You bother the Great White Oracle for this ? That shivering child ? Clearly he is incompetent and I bet he 's a sissy . Yeah ! Or a cry baby . Is this true ? Is baby gonna cry ? - Like a whittle baby cry ? - I 'm not a cry baby ! Don 't kid yourself there . You 're a bit of a pussy . - No offense . - I can do this ! I am the chosen one ! I have the Ring of Power ! - Your princess is completely screwed . - There 's a princess ? Sure , and she is a looker ! Please ! She dresses like a whore . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Hold up , soldier . We launch in waves . So , where you from , son ? I am exchange henchman from Russian Supervillain . Ya picked a helluva time to come over . OK , you 're up . See you on the other side , comrade ! Stick close and follow my lead . You 'll make it through this , soldier . - Oh , thanks , Brock . - Hank ? ! Damn it , Hank ! What did I ? We 'll talk about this later ! Henchmen ! Like we planned . Use the canyon for cover ! Maintain battle formations . And use those safety catches ! No clumping up like a JV soccer team ! Keep an erratic flight path ! Don 't let them put a bead on ya ! It 's fire then fall back ! Fire then fall back ! Dozens of them ! Everywhere ! Coming at us ! All sides ! Stay on The Monarch ! B-Squad ! Fall back and regroup . Let the flies come to the spider 's web . Come on , man , let me get ' em ! I 'm a streetwalkin ' cheetah with a heart fulla napalm ! Gimme danger ! Calm yourself ! I need you here to protect my queen . - Yes , Sovereign . - This is insane . There 's no way you can be the Sovereign ! I 've seen him chew you out over that TV ... whatever thing . The screen thing . - Telescreen . - You stay out of this ! God , you two skeeve me ! Didn 't you get the memo ? The old Sovereign is dead . I 've given myself a promotion . You killed him . You killed him , didn 't you ? Not me personally , but it was my invisible hand which guided the ... Well , I don 't have to tell you that . - You were there . - Bowie ? ! Quite a bean in that pretty little head . Give the lady a prize ! So this thing with The Monarch . Then this was all a ... - A front ? ! - Oh , dear . You didn 't really think all of this was just about you , did you ? No , thanks . I have to save mein voice . The smoking ? Outside ! Dude , what are you doing over here ? I 'm not good at turning yet . I 'm just flying all over the place . Squad E is down and my squad is mostly on fire . I need you ! Was it you guys that got caught in that engine ? - No , that 's an urban myth . - What does that even mean ? ! How can you start an urban myth with flying guys in the Grand Canyon ? Knock off all that chatter ! We 're comin ' up on the target ! Man , this is ridiculous . God , it 's friggin ' cold , man . Hello . I 'm David Bowie . - What the ? - Make way for the homo superior ! But you 're still chasing him ? Why ? You got what you came for . Because , my dear , I 've finally learned how to mix business with pleasure ! Your champagne 's getting warm . It 's wicked bad out there , sir . I didn 't mean to let you down . These five minutes under your command have been ... the proudest ... of my ... career . What are you waiting for , soldier ? Bogeys on your ten and two . Take ' em out ! Great shot , kid ! That was one in a million ! Henchmen ! We 're all clear . Move in on the command ship ! Turn , tiny engines ! Let your agony be the power that turns the engine of my black heart ! Turn , my orphans ! Turn me on ! Dean the Brave ! Your reign of extra badness is over , Insect King ! I shall destroy you as easily as I destroyed your father . He didn 't have ... the ring of power ! No , not the ring of power ! It 's the only thing that can steal my black heart ! Eat it ! That ... ing hurts ! Right down to the thorax ! Dick ! But it missed my black heart ! Die ! Dude , stop already ! You 're not even aiming for my black heart ! I vanquish you ! Come on , those are reproductive organs ! Will you take the f ... ing hint and stab me in the heart already ? ! I got it ! Your evil black heart is where your power comes from ! Oh , no ! You have learned my terrible secret ! Now we must destroy his evil machinery ! Run , orphans , be free ! And have your own room and maybe not have to live ... in fear of costumed guys trying to kill you all the time ! And with no yaddies freaking out on you , or , like , putting you on a rocket ship . Run to a place where your father ... will make you get in a fight with a Venus Flytrap ... and wands and with a gun ! What 's going on ? I got no go here ! Here 's something . We just lost power , like , all of it . - Where 'd it go ? - Well , I don 't know . Somewhere ? - Not in the engine . - What ? ! Someone go to the engine room and find out what happened ! No . No way . That place is spooky . Do you pay these people ? Wanna see my escape cocoon ? - Bowie . - That 's " Sovereign " to you . What say ? Check it ! It 's like Dracula versus Yoda in there ! The bolt cutters ! You were in charge of the bolt cutters ! Cut me some slack ! I wasn 't getting any altitude . I had to drop ballast . - That 's why my shoes aren 't even on . - Panicked . The man panicked . You didn 't see me throwing Certs out of my pocket , anything . This is useless . What the deuce was that ? ! I don 't care ! We 're gonna crash into that flying vase-thing ! Can 't you put a magic protective bubble around us ? Join hands . Our powers are stronger as a team ! No , they 're not . I 'm a blackula hunter , I don 't have powers . I got a magic powder that turns mosquitoes into bats ! But if you want to join hands ... Come on ! Come on , I wanna go with you guys ! F ... off ! It only seats two . Two ! Or would you prefer an escape butterfly ? Because you are the chosen one , you have saved Insectia . I can once again take my rightful place ... as the beautiful and approachable princess of everything . That sounds nifty ! But I think we should ... make-out . I love you ! That little guy we made ? All over the windshield . Watch your feet . I think its head is out there . Byron Orpheus , magic guy . Never flown an experimental jet before . Magic . A dog dragon ! Wait here with the orphans ! I must free Giant Boy Detective from the Spider Queen ! That 's the scrawny Venture kid . And he 's crazier than usual . To the castle in the clouds ! Fly ! He 's snapped , lost touch with this world and created another ! We must spirit him to safety ! He 's creepy . I am so not gonna touch him . No way ! Dude . Nobody tells me anything ! Did anybody else know this ? Again ! Again ! Again ! Pookums ! I 'm so glad you 're ... Hi , David ... Bowie . Have you seen ... I 'm over here ! Sweetness ! There you a ... Oh , crap ! Are you OK ? Tell me you 're not paralyzed , because that would be so unfair to ... both of us . I 'm fine , I just ... There . I was pinned under ... I think it 's Phantom Limb 's leg . Give it here ! I want to kick his smug limey face in with it ! He 's gone . No doubt a secret escape hatch or some such nonsense . God , how cliché can one man get ? Great ! Now I have a new arch-enemy . I wouldn 't concern yourself . There won 't be a corner of the globe he 'll be safe in ... once I sic the Diamond Dogs on his scent . Well , gotta run , love . Vicious coup to squash , strangers to execute , you know how it is . Congratulations , both of you ! Ta ! - Doc , you OK ? - I swallowed a gold filling in the crash ... so we have to hook up the metal detector to the toilet again . What 'd we miss ? The guy from Labyrinth turned into a bird ! OK . So the Sovereign recorded Station To Station ? And Changes One ? Love that album ! Could you be a bigger poser ? Changes is a Best of ! Don 't panic ! Dean is safe ! Safe in the magic hands of the Order of the ... - Hey , pop . - Dean was missing ? Nice job , Brock . Peoples , somebody here lose an invisible ... I 'm keeping this . It 's even more beautiful than I imagined ! - He gonna be OK up there ? - Yeah , he does this all the time . He 'll pass out in a couple of minutes and we 'll go up and get him . You 're insatiable , woman ! That 's one myth about married life we can scratch off the list . - You know , I never actually said " I do . " - You never said you don 't . Well , there 's something else I haven 't said . It ... It might ... change things . Is it " Let 's go again ? " Because I 'm gonna need a few ... No . OK , deep breath . Sheila , you 've been rehearsing this . Monarch , I 'm ... What ? ! Qu 'ils mangent de la soupe .

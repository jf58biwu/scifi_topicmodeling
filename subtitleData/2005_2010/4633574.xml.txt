 There was a time when " energy " was a dirty word . When turning on your lights was a hard choice . Cities in brownout , ... food shortages , cars burning fuel to run . But that was the past . Where are we now ? How do we make the world so much better ? Make deserts bloom ! Right now , we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world . The energy of the sun , trapped in rock , harvested by machine from the far side of the moon . Today , we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 ... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70 % of the planet . Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads ? The power of the moon ... the power of our future . Rock and roll ! 08 : 32 , Pacific Time . All harvesters running smoothly . Readouts are as follows : Matthew ... 14.6 miles . Mark ... 16.8 miles . I don 't ... Hey , Gerty ? Gerty ? Wake up ! Good morning , Sam ! We have got a live one on Mark ! I 'm going to go out now and rope her in . OK , Sam . I want chocolate .

Almost ! Three years is a long haul . You know ... It 's way , way , way , way , way too long ! I 'm talking to myself ... on a regular basis ! So ... Time to go home , you know what I mean ? That 's it , over and out ! Rock and roll , God bless America ! I can do that for you , Sam . God damn it ! I said I got it ! Why don 't you listen to me ? Package ready for launch . Sam , is everything OK ? - Sam ? - What ? You don 't seem like yourself today . - Is something wrong ? - No . Can you turn that off , please ? Jesus Christ ! Sam , it might help you to talk about it . Gerty , have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat ? No , Sam . From what I understand , it is fairly low ... on the company 's priority list right now . You tell them to sort that out . You know what I 'm talking about ? That 's not ... I 've only got two weeks ! But it 's not fair for whoever 's coming up here next . I will , Sam . Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later ? No , come on , let 's finish this . Got one of those headaches ... Can you ... , can you give me something for it ? Message received from your wife , Sam ... via Jupiter link . Fuck ! Hi , Sam ! It 's me . I got your last message . It was really good to hear your voice . I miss you , too ! I know you 're really lonely up there ... But I think ... In a lot of ways ... it 's been really good for you . For both of us . God , I hope you do not mind me saying that . I 'm proud of you ! Someone has got something to say . What did you want to say to daddy , baby ? Say " astronaut " . Astronaut . He is an astronaut ! Say daddy 's an astronaut . Say it really loud . Daddy 's an astronaut . Clever girl ! Wave ! Give daddy a wave ! Kathy , could you ... I can 't believe you 're going to be home soon . It 's her birthday next month ... And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden . - Gerty ! - We could work at it together . Sam ... I love you ! I love you ! - And I miss you ! - I miss you ! And I can 't wait to see you . OK , sweetheart ... Goodbye . Hi , Doug ! You 're really full of yourself , aren 't you , Doug ? Kath ... Not good ! What about Dumbo ? ... Fuck ! God damn it ! Fuck ! Wasn 't kind of smart , was it , Gerty ? - Sam , can I ask how it happened ? - I told you . I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand . You saw something on TV ? Yeah , I something on TV that distracted me . Is there something wrong with that , Gerty ? Sam , you said it was the TV that distracted you ... but when I came in , the TV wasn 't on . Perhaps you were imagining things ? Yeah , you think too much , pal . You need to get laid . I 'm going to go back to work . Shut up ! Good morning , Gerty . Good morning , Sam . - How are you today ? - Fine ! Fine . - How is the hand ? - Oh , it 's a little sore ! A little sore . It 's OK . - What 's for breakfast ? - The usual . Mmhmm . - Two weeks to go , Sam . - Two weeks to go , buddy ! Would you like some hot sauce on your beans ? No , my tummy 's a little tender , actually . But , thank you . Thank you , Gerty . You 're welcome , Sam . 08 : 19 , Pacific Time . Readouts are as follows ... Matthew ... 9.8 miles . Mark is less ... - 9 ... - Hey , Gerty ! Rock and roll ! Mark ... umm ... Mark is 11 miles on the button . Luke is a little twitchy today . Hey , Gerty . Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew . I 'm going to go out in a few minutes . I 'm just going to finish my coffee , OK ? OK , Sam . Searching for long-range comms . Signal failure on long-range comms . Danger . Atmosphere compromised . Where am ... - Where am I ? - Sam , you 're in the infirmary . You had an accident . Do you remember what happened ? No , I don 't ... I don 't remember a thing . Do you remember me ? Yeah , of course I remember you , Gerty . That 's good . That is very good . It 's nice to see you awake again . I 'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days ... And run some tests . How long have I been out ? Not long , Sam . Go back to sleep . - OK , pal . - You 're still very tired . We can talk later . Hello ? The new Sam is in reworking order . But we only have two working harvesters now . Yeah , well , what a surprise ! Gerty , we 're going to have to find a way to ramp up production . I know . This is incredible ! But how do you manage to destroy ... a fucking rover , a harvester and an employee all on the same day ? These were extraordinary circumstances , as you know . Gerty , what is the status on Harvester 3 ? How do the repairs look on ... - Sam , you 're out of bed . - Yeah . I wanted to stretch my legs a bit . Who was that ? We 've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat ... And our live feed seems to be down . I was recording a video-message for Central ... Updating them on your progress . Sam , you need to stay in bed . You 're not ready to walk around yet . Can you bring me my sunglasses ? It 's really bright in here . Give me some ... Give me all my stuff , you know ? Your belongings are in your quarters , Sam . - Well , bring them in here . - Certainly . Excellent , Sam . What ... When can I get out of here , Gerty ? Sam , you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash . This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment . So what 's the diagnosis ? When can I get back to work ? Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters ... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back . That 's terrific ! That 's fantastic ! You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow . But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule . Let 's try another test . I don 't want to try another test ! Please , Sam . Hey , Gerty ? Do you know about this ? Matthew has got no velocity readout . He is completely still . He must have stalled . Well , he has obviously stalled . Don 't you think we should tell Central ? Unlock the doors and I 'll go fix it . I will pass on your message . Message received from Earth via Jupiter link . Sam , we appreciate the offer , but you concentrate on feeling better . Yeah , we don 't want you to take any unnecessary risks . - You are too important to us . - You stay put . That is an order . It 's an order , Sam ... from Lunar . And what we 're going to do is send a rescue unit ... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet . - Fuck is with ... ? What the fuck ? - I 'm sorry , Sam . - What ? - Sam ... I 'm under strict orders not to let you outside . I don 't appreciate that , being treated like a child . I don 't appreciate it . Gerty ! Gerty ! Gerty , come here ! - What happened ? - I do not know , maybe a meteorite ... There have been no meteorites , Sam . Micrometeorites , maybe . I do not know . Either way , there might be damage to the exterior shell . I think you better ... you better let me go outside and take a look . There is no damage to the exterior shell . Well , it 's not that I don 't believe you , Gerty ... But , you know , this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose . You need to let me go outside and fix this problem , Gery . I can 't let you go outside , Sam . Gerty , if you don 't let me go outside , we can 't fix this leak . I 'm not permitted to let you go outside . Just let ... We 'll keep it between you and me , ok , pal ? This thing is leaking gas . Let 's go ! Come on ... Just to check the exterior shell ? - Of course . - OK , Sam . Thank you . Gerty !

We need to get him to the infirmary immediately . Hello , Sam . How are you feeling ? Where ... Where am I ? The infirmary . You had an accident out by one of the harvesters . Do you remember ? No , I 'm ... I 'm thirsty . I could get you some water . I saw someone out there , Gerty . I saw someone out there . Sam , you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries . But , all in all , the prognosis is good . I 'm happy to see you again . Gerty ? Yes , Sam ? Is there someone in the room with us ? Sam , get some sleep . You 're very tired . Spoke to Thompson today . They are in Europe , they ... he 's promising the world . I think it was the right thing . But ... it 's just such a long time . I suppose there are ... there are things ... You know ... that needed to happen . I ... I need time to think . Listen ... umm ... Sam ... Be safe ... And I 'll ... I 'll talk to you soon . Goodbye . Gerty ? Gerty , what the fu ... what the hell 's going on ? Who is the guy ... Who is the guy in the rec room ? Where did he come from ? Why does he look like me ? Sam , you 're out out of bed . Yeah , Gerty , I 'm out of bed . Who is the guy ? Who is the guy in the rec room ? - Sam Bell . - Come on , come on , come on ! You are Sam Bell . Sam , what is it ? It might help to talk about it . I don 't understand what is happening ... I think I 'm starting to lose my mind . We can run some tests . I haven 't let Sam contact Lunar . They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident . " Recovered alive " ? What do you mean ? Why did not you report it to Central ? What are you talking about ? I 'm here to keep you safe , Sam . Are you hungry ? Two weeks , two weeks , two weeks ...

About a week . - So how are you doing ? - What ? How are you doing ? " How am I doing ? " How do you think I 'm doing ? They locked all the exits . Who 's looking after the harvesters ? Harvesters are fine . It 's the fact that I 'm here talking to a clone that 's slightly troubling . I 'm not a clone . I 'm not a clone ! - You 're the clone . - Okay , Sam . You 're not a clone . Hey , hey ... You 're not looking too good . Sh ! Butt out of this ! I 'm not even talking to you , pal . I think that Katherine likes you . I think she likes you a bit . You 're not looking too good , my friend . I hope you 're not feeling too bad . Are you talking to yourself ? - Let 's just get you fixed up ... - How long have you been here ? Well , it 's about ... three years . For almost three years . Listen , I ... I wanted to thank y ... . I wanted to thank you for , um ... If it wasn 't for you , I 'd ... I ... I guess I 'd still be in that crashed rover . You saved my life . Hey , I know this is weird , you know ... ? I 'm real lonely , you know , I ... I just wanted to shake your hand . Will you shake my hand ? Maybe later . - What are you looking at ? - You look just like me , it 's incredible . Why do I look like you ? Why don 't you look like me ? We look like each other , I guess . I don 't know . Hey , you know ... It 's weird for me , too , you know ? Hey ? Hey , you want to play some ping-pong ? No . Come on , I 'll teach you .

Yeah , " OK " . - Should we play ? - Yeah ! Fuck ! God ! Shit ! 19-2 . Yeah ... You want a ... You want a stick of gum ? You know ... You should approach this in a different way . - Remember when you went to flight school ? - What are you doing ? I 'm fixing the net . It is very Zen with ping-pong , you have to just to relax . How long did it take you took to do that ? Oh , I don 't remember doing all of it . I remember doing the church ... and the Salvation Army . And doing the people . My mind has been acting kind of weird lately . That 's Fairfield , right ? There 's the town hall . Fairfield , that 's right ... Yeah , that 's Tess ... and Eve ... You ... You know Tess ? Yeah , I know Tess . - You know about Eve , right ? - What ? I had a ... We had a girl ... Eve . Ain 't she beautiful ? She 's my little monkey . She 's our little monkey . High five ! She might be the milkman 's , but she 's beautiful . Sam , a new message has arrived from Earth . Oh shit ! - Greetings , Sam . - How 's our man ? You feeling better ? - Have you had enough rest ? - You resting up , Sam ? You better be , you bastard . Well , enjoy it while it lasts . We 've got some good news . The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus , so we 've got a few pairs of hands for you . So what we 've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule . Rescue Unit Eliza . Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months . We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours . So commence to jump for joy ! You 're about to be back at work . In the meantime , hang in there . Rest up . You hang in there , Sam . Over and out ! They 're sending a rescue unit ? Why ? Why are they sending a rescue unit ? To fix the stalled harvester . They didn 't think I was up to it . Well , then I 'm going back . That 's it for me . - What ? - Is that what you really think ? Yeah . I 've got a contract ! I 'm going home . - You 're a fucking clone . You don 't have shit . - Hey , I 'm going home ! - Home ! - You 're not going anywhere . You know , you 've been up here too long , man . You have lost your marbles . What do you think , Tess is back home , waiting on the sofa in lingerie ? What about the original Sam ? Huh ? I am the original Sam ! - I am Sam-fucking-Bell . - Hey ! Me ! Me ! Gerty , am I a clone ? Are you hungry ? Hey , hey ... Don 't get your fucking panties in a twist . I 'm in the same boat , asshole . Listen ... - What about the other clones ? - What ? We might not be the first two to have been woken up . You said that that model had already been started when you got here . Well , who started it ? There might be others up here right now . Think about it . How did I get up here so quickly after your crash ? - I don 't know ... - They didn 't ship me in from Central . There wasn 't time . I must have come from the base . I don 't know what you 're smoking . Why would they do that ? That 's ridiculous . Impossible . I bet there 's some kind of secret room . " Secret room " ? Yeah , a secret room . Why not ? You know , you are the one that has lost your marbles . I 've been here three years , man . I know every inch of this base . And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there . Why would they do that ? What 's the motive ? Look , it 's a company , right ? They have investors , they have shareholders . Shit like that . What 's cheaper ? Spending time and money training new personnel ... Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job ? It 's the far side of the moon ! Those cheap fucks haven 't even fixed the communication satellite yet ! - Tess would know , she would have told me ... - Hey , Gepetto , wake up ! You really think they give a shit about us ? They 're laughing all the way to the bank ! Tess would know , she would have told me ... Where do you get off ? ! Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy ! - Jesus Christ ... - Wake up ! There 's some area that we don 't know about . And I 'm going to find it . Yeah , maybe you 'll find some buried treasure , too . Fuck ! Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours . You find your secret room ? Just put that anywhere . Yes , that 's a good idea ... - That 's where I keep my leprechauns . - Get out of the way . - What ? Why ? - I want to look underneath that model . You 're not touching this model . Get the fuck out of the way ! Listen , why don 't you just relax , right ? Why don 't you take a pill ? Bake a cake ? - Go read the encyclopedia or something ? - Oh , you 're a tough guy now ? What , are you going to stab me ? No , I 'm a peaceful warrior . I 'm a lover , not a fighter . Put the knife down . I want to look underneath there . - Put the knife down . - No , I 'm not going to give you the knife . - What ? - Just get out of the way . - Take it easy . - Let go of the knife . Don 't ever tell me what to do . - Let go . - You let go of the knife . - Don 't be an asshole . - Don 't push me . - Don 't push me , motherfucker ! - Let go . Let go ! What did I fucking tell you ? " Let go of the goddamn knife . " You fucking little girl , man ! Damn it ! What did I tell you ? You going to stop ? You going to stop ? OK ! OK ! Jesus , fuck ! Fuck me ! What the fuck ? I hardly ... I hardly touched you . Let me see . - That 's a lot of blood . - Get off of me ! Hello , Sam . Sam , is everything OK ? Yeah ! Yeah , we had a fight . Me and the other guy , the other ... He 's very angry , you know ? You know what he did ? He flipped my entire model over ! You know how much work I put into that thing ? 938 hours . 938 hours . Yeah , exactly . 938 hours , really ? Approximately . He 's got a problem . He scares me , Gerty . What is it about Sam that scares you ? The guy flies off the handle . I see it now . I see what Tess was talking about . I never told you this , Gerty , but she ... She ... She left me . Tess left me . For 6 months . She moved back in with her parents . I know . She gave me a second chance . - I promised here that I 'd change . - You have changed , Sam . Hey , Gerty , since I 've been up here , I 've sent Tess ... I 've sent her over a hundred video messages . Where did those messages go ? Did they ever reach her ? Sam , I can only account for what occurs on the base . What about the messages she sent to me ? Sam , I can only account for what occurs on the base . Gerty ... Gerty ? Am I really a clone ? When you first arrived at Sarang , there was a small crash . You woke up in the infirmary . You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss . I kept you under observation and ran some tests . I remember , yea , I remember that ... Sam , there was no crash . You were being awakened . It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests ... to establish mental stability .. and general physical health . Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA ... can have considerable impact on ... What about Tess ? What about Eve ? They are memory implants , Sam . Uploaded , edited memories of the original Sam Bell . I 'm very sorry . Sam , it 's been several hours since your last meal . Can I prepare you something ? Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours . - You OK , sweetheart ? - Yeah , I 'm staring into space . Hey ! Thanks for this , this is good . This is cozy . How 's the nose ? Much better , thank you . I went haywire before . You know ... I lost it . I ... - I 'm sorry about that . - It 's OK . No , it 's not OK . I fucked up Fairfield . I fucked up your model . I don 't know what 's wrong with me . I 've got ... I 've got a temper , I 've got to do something about that . Yes , you do . Hey , can you turn that off for a second ? I want to talk to you . Can you turn that off ? Listen . Listen . I wasn 't supposed to ... I 'm trying to tell you something . I never instructed Gerty to ... Listen to me . I wasn 't supposed to find you ... Tough Guy . - Listen to me ! - You look like a radioactive tampon . Like a banana with a yeast infection . Listen to me . I wasn 't supposed to find you . Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there . And there 's something else . Right around the time I was awakened ... I walked in on Gerty talking with Central . He was having a live conversation . " A live conversation " ? - Yeah . - How do you know it was a live conversation ? Because it was a back-and-forth exchange . Communications equipment was damaged . There was a solar storm . - It was live , man , it was live . - That 's impossible . There was a flare , it fried the satellite . The satellite is fine . They don 't want us to be able to contact Earth . They lied to us . They 've been lying to us since the beginning . They 've been lying since forever . If the satellite works , how are they blocking the live feed from down here ? Everything works fine . Maybe they 're not blocking the signal from inside the base ? From where , then ? Searching for long-range comms . I 'm just passing the last of the harvesters . Looks like John . How long until you are out of the base 's range ? Um , a minute . - 90 seconds tops . - Have you ever been out this far ? No ... never have . Leaving Sarang working perimeter . Leaving Sarang working perimeter . Leaving Sarang working perimeter . - See anything ? - It 'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for . Wait a second , I see something . Approaching station 3 . Holy shit ! I think I see something , too . Approaching station 1 . Do you see what I see ? Looks like an antenna or ... or ... A pylon or something . I think it 's the jammer . Dude ! This is why we 're not getting the live feed . - Sam ? Can you hear me ? - Yeah . Yeah , yeah I hear you . Listen , I 'm not feeling too good . I 'm going to ... I 'm going to head back to the base . OK , I 'm going to stay out here for a while . I 'm going to see if there 's any more of these things . Fuck ... Fuck ... Fuck . Access denied . Access denied . Access denied . Password accepted . Accessing Sam Bell database . My hair 's falling out . How about that for a status ? We 'll do this another time . Fuck ! I 'm going to see her soon . Rescue arrival estimated in 9 hours .

Hey , I saw 3 more of those jammers . I think the base is surrounded with them . I printed out their coordinates . Bud , what 's wrong with you ? What 's going on ? I found your secret room . - Who goes first ? - I go first . Jesus Christ , there 's so many of them . Why are there so many of them ? Sam , can I help you with something ? Not now , Gerty .

Of course , Sam , how can I help ? We 've found the hidden room . We know about the others . That hidden room , Gerty . The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones , Sam . Gerty , we need to wake up a new clone . New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed . Gerty , if you don 't wake up another clone , me and the other Sam will die . We will be killed , do you understand ? - Yes . - You want me and the other Sam to be killed ? - That is the last thing I want . - Well , then you have to wake up a new clone . OK , pal ? Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours . What 's going on ? You OK ? Don 't ... Don 't touch him . Come here . He 's not conscious yet . Gerty and I just woke him up . Why ? What 's going on ? Come on outside . When the rescue unit arrives , they 're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover . That guy ? What , are you going to kill him ? - Jesus Christ . - What are you doing ? Zip up your fly . You 're burning up . Sweating like a pig . Put your hat on . Put your hat on . If I go through with this , I 'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site . What about us ? When Eliza arrives , it finds you and me as a welcome party ... They aren 't going to find you and me as a welcome party . They 're going to find me . You 're going back to Earth before they get here . In that helium-3 launcher . I did the math , you 're going to pull some G 's . But you 'll be fine . You 'll be all right . You 're going home . You did your three years . They can 't expect you to stick around . Maybe you can meet Eve in person . I saw that V.P. She 's beautiful . She 's gorgeous . You did good . High five ! Go for it . - Are you comfy ? - No . - What ? - No ! - What if I have to take a shit ? - Well , I guess you 'll just have to hold it in , pal . For three days ? That 's the way it goes . - Need a hand ? - No . OK . All right . No reason for hostility . I 'm just trying to help out . Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours . Hey , we need to do this . If we wait too long ... The other one 's going to be conscious . What 's going on with you ? I changed my mind . I 'm not going back . I don 't think I can move my legs . Besides , look at me ! If I meet Eve now ... I 'd scare the crap out of her ! What are you talking about , man ? She 's your daughter . She doesn 't care what you look like . You 're not going to kill anybody . We can 't kill anybody . You can 't . I know you can 't , because I can 't . You go . You 're a good guy , Sam . And it was a good plan . You know , you just picked the wrong guy to go back . Are you sure about this ? Yeah . You should ... You should travel , you know ? I always wanted to do that . Amsterdam or ... Yeah , I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe ... Mexico . Aloha ! Bring me back a piña colada . All right , pal ? Hey , Johnny Spaceman ? Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview ? She was so beautiful . She wasn 't the best candidate , but it didn 't matter ... I had to give her the job . I wanted to keep her in the country . She was going back to Ireland . And you knew you had to take a chance . So ... you called her ... You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine ... but you didn 't need it , because she picked up the phone . She was like , " Why is he calling me ? " " The internship is over . Why is he calling me at home ? " I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that . She said , " Let 's get a drink . " I said , " OK . " We ... Sam , this is not going to work . Why ? I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening . If anyone were to check my memory cache , it would put you in considerable danger . You could erase my memory banks . I could reboot myself once you have departed . - Are you okay with that ? - I 'm here to keep you safe , Sam . I want to help you . Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes . Sam . I set your ... I set your computer to reboot ... - the moment that I launch . - I understand , Sam . You should be OK . I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be .

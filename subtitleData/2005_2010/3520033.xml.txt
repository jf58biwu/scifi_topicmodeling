 Dad , what 's happening ? Nick , Listen to me like we 're the Iast two people on the planet . Okay ? Nick , Some day a girl is going to give you a flower . You got that ? A flower . And you have to help her . You help her and you help us all . Okay ? I know it doesn 't make any sense right now , but I believe the woman who told me that . You think you could believe me ? I love you . I always said you were special , Nick . Turns out I was right . Division 's here . Just keep moving . And don 't make any decisions that any watcher can track . I just wanted to have a conversation . What a waste . Bring his body to the lab . There are special people in this world . We don 't ask to be special . We 're just born this way . We pass you on the streets every day , unnoticed by most . It started in 1945 . The Nazis were conducting experiments in psychic warfare ... trying to turn those with psychic abilities into soldiers . Lots of us died . The war ended , but the experiments never stopped . Other governments around the world set up what they called " Divisions " ... trying to do what the Nazis couldn 't , to turn us into weapons . Division 's agents are trained to track and hunt us down like animals ... take us away from our families and friends . There are children stuffed away all over the world . They test us and categorize us . I 'm what they call a " watcher " . We can see the future , even if that 's not always as simple as it sounds . The jumbo jet crashed . There are no reports of survivors . Others are called " movers " , just an easy way of saying " telekinetic " . " Pushers " put thoughts in your head and make whatever Lie they come up with the truth . They 'd already begun to control my mind ... " Sniffs " , " shifters " , " shadows " , " bleeders ' ' , it goes on and on . In Division 's eyes , we 're all just lab rats . Only one problem : we keep dying . The evidence shows that the kids were given milk with radioactive iodine . No one has ever survived the drug meant to boost our powers . My name is Cassie Holmes . Division took my mom from me . Right now the future I see doesn 't look so great . The good news is the future is always changing ... in the largest of ways by the smallest of things . They 've been winning a lot of battles . Now it 's our turn to win the war . " TODAY " " DIVISION LAB " She survived the injection . She 's our patient zero . Bring me every sniffer we have . But she 's on foot . She can 't get far . She 'll get help from anyone she can lay her eyes on . Do whatever is necessary to get her and that syringe back ! Now ! " 2 DAYS FROM NOW " You 're already down five thousand I hear you owe more than that to Chen . Chen 's a liar ... Am I a liar too ? I was told ... you owe fifteen So you want to bet or not ? Ok . But if you lose again ... I 'll have you beaten . You owe us six thousand , Nick ! What do you say , Nick ? Who are you ? - We 're with Division . - Like you didn 't know . - Go to hell . - Easy , son . If we wanted you , you 'd be in the back of a van . You gonna let us in or are we gonna have to be rude ? Smart move living in a shithole like this . One on top of the other . Took you far off the radar . Not far enough . Would you believe this is how we found you ? From your old toothbrush from that encounter ten years ago . Barely a scent left . Thought you were in Tokyo . Then Malaysia . Finally we got a few readings on some buildings . There 's a lot of runaway psychics in Hong Kong trying to disappear . Nick . People with no country , no loyalty ... No desire to get involved in political bullshit . Nobody but you in this apartment for a long time , Nick . Why ? You looking for someone besides me ? A girl . She has something belonging to us . Better than a hunch you know her . Obviously I don 't . In case we need to get hold of you again . I 've got some old toilet paper you boys might like more . Don 't bother running . We know where you are now . Shit . - Yeah ? - Hey , Nick . - Who is this ? - Open up , Nick . And put your gun down . Put that thing away . Got you something . Where 's the chicken ... ? There it is . Hey , whoa ! Excuse me ? Is this how you treat your guests ? This is how I treat random strangers who barge into my apartment . Like the Division sniffers who were just here ? Who are you ? I 'm Cassie . I 'm here to help you . Listen , Cassie ... I 'm sure your mom and dad are nervous about you right now , so why don 't you ... - You don 't understand . - You 've got that right . This is about us finding six million dollars . That 's us . And that 's our money . And that 's my toothbrush . You 're a watcher . So is there a place we can get something to eat besides chicken ? I 'm buying . Lose a bet with your hairdresser ? I Like color . First things first . I know you 're a second-generation mover . Is that what the kids are calling it these days ? I 'll let you know when I see one . You don 't really use your powers , which means you haven 't practiced and you kind of suck at it . - How am I doing so far ? - Go on . I 'm a watcher . Second generation , like you . - Wow . That 's ... - Complicated . Because the future can change just by talking about it . So I see glimpses and I draw in my book . But I 'm not really good at it . I 'm kind of a crappy artist , but ... I 'm sure you already knew that . But I got the sniffs in your apartment , right ? That 's why I brought you a new toothbrush . Anything with shrimp . You speak Chinese ? Cantonese . I 'm surprised you didn 't know that , being a watcher . I get things wrong sometimes . I know the feeling . Are you worried about the thugs you owe money to ? Don 't . Thank you . We 'll be able to take care of it in a couple days . With your six million dollars . - Where 's the money ? - It 's on its way here . With a girl . Don 't tell me . Same girl Division sniffs are looking for . It 's Cassie , right ? Enjoy your food . - That 's it ? - That 's it . Sorry . Some 12-year-old that knew I needed a new toothbrush ... isn 't enough to get me involved with Division . Even if it 's not a con . I 'm 13 . And I 've been told I look at least 14 . - Right . - And this is not a con . This is a way for everyone to get something they want . I 've actually used that line before . Fine . Don 't believe me . - But you will help me . - Really ? Because I 'm getting a message . It 's telling me " find somebody else " . If we don 't find the case and that girl , really bad things happen , Nick . What ? What 's wrong ? Shit . They 're here in the market . Who ? - Who ? - They 're in the market ! Come on ! - Division ? - Bleeders ! We 've got to get out of here ! - How does this end ? - I have no idea . Where is the girl ? My daughter has already seen you with her . Told you . I 've told three people already today , I don 't know this girl . Stupid child . I already saw how you die . Then you know it 's not here and it 's not today . Damn . Go , go ! ... Go , go ! ... Go , go ! ... Nick ! The big tanks ... Go ! - Quick ! - This way ! Stop ... ! - Stop ... ! - Run , Cassie ! Stop ... ! Not like this If we kill him we lose the girl I already know you 're here . You must be Cassie Holmes . - Who sent you ? - Your mother . A week before she was captured by Division , she told me to be at that fish market today . Stay away from him . If that 's what you want . Just be sure to add his picture to the Wall of the Dead . You 're a stitch . That should be obvious to a watcher . If you had even a modicum of your mother 's talent ... I 've been dealing with a lot . Years ago your mother did me a favor . Now it would seem I need to pay off my debt . I hear they 've got your mother buried deep inside Division . Have her so drugged up she can 't even hold a spoon . I bet they suck the future right out of her . You help her and you help us all . A flower Is he okay ? - You okay ? - Yeah . Wow . That woman 's got magic fingers . For you . What is that ? It 's a lotus . I heard what she said about your mother . You did ? Division 's got her . They locked her up because she 's the ... greatest watcher they 've ever seen . They 're afraid of her . And they 're afraid they can 't control her . They killed my father for the same reason . But I guess you already knew that . I see the future , not the past . And right now our future isn 't that great . That 's new ? Now the sniffs from your apartment are going to get the girl and the case . It 's changed . I don 't know why ... something I did , a mistake I made ... Doesn 't matter , it just has . My mother told me that case ... is the key to bringing down Division and freeing her . There 's no money in that case , is there ? Unless I 'm missing something , they don 't have the case yet . It 's still out there . If your mother 's such a great fortune-teller , how did she get caught ? I 'm just going to have to ask her that myself . I haven 't even gotten to the bad part yet . What is that ? We die . Great . Hello , Kira . You have a plane to catch . Come on . You want to come with us . Christ . Get a load of that . She must use that ten times a day . That 's a keeper . You 're not gonna have a lot of lipstick opportunities where you 're going . You know what I mean ? She 's doing it again . - Get the hell out of my head ! - No ! No ! - What does she want ? - She 's got to go to the bathroom . To throw up or something . Carver will kill us if anything happens to her . - Bathroom ? - This way . Come on . Coffee , black , with sugar . Alright . In you go . You 're a good man , Agent Mack . I bet you come from a good family . It must have been hard for you when he died . Who died ? Your brother . - I don 't have a brother , sweetheart . - No , you do . I 've got something that will make you feel better . And you loved him very much . But he was murdered . And you know who did it , don 't you ? But he was murdered ... And you know who did it , don 't you ? You know who did it , don 't you ? But he was murdered ... You know who did it he was murdered ... Lame . We 've got to work on your skills if we 're going to change anything . Don 't bite your nails . The lollipop chick freaks me out . - She 's a watcher . - Like you . Yeah . I know this place . This is ... I know this place . Club B , boss . Science Museum Road . Thank you . Why is that olive out of the glass ? - That 's not an olive . It 's a bead . - It 's a bead ? Yeah , it 's a bead . A shimmery kind of thing ... Well , it looks like a pimento . If I was going to draw a bead , I 'd ... It 's a bead with a shimmer . What does the bead have to do with it ? I don 't know what the shiny , shimmery bead has to do with it . Great . Let 's keep it simple . We 'll start with the bead and see where it takes us . Sounds like a plan , but ... what about the part where we die ? I remember growing up together . Where we went to school . How he died . So except for this brother you never had ... is there anything else she might have put in your head ? I 'm only asking because I don 't want to be shot in the face ... for screwing some made up sister you don 't really have . I don 't have a sister ? Agent Mack , you are relieved of duty . Get on a plane , eat some peanuts , and go home . She won 't push me again , sir . She just caught me off-guard . The only thoughts in my head are my own . You 're willing to risk your life on that ? Yes , sir . Then put the gun in your mouth and pull the trigger . Don 't worry . You already checked it . It 's not loaded . Spread these beads to any sniff , any watcher , any goddamn expatriate reader in Hong Kong who knows up from down until we find Kira . What about the Chinese government and their guys ? The story is out , bleeders all over the country will be looking for her . We can 't let them get the drug . Then we put a price on her head . Yeah , this is it . Hey , can you ... I don 't have any ... Yeah ! Sure . I got it . There you go . You can keep it . Thanks . How much do you have ? Don 't give him all of that . - It 's not gonna be enough . - It 's enough . - Just give me the ... - It 's enough . / Excuse me , sir ? Hey . We need five minutes . - Five minutes - Yeah ! Listen , this is a place for grown-ups , - so behave yourself . - Shut up . That sounds about right . - Choose another . - Yeah ! Show me ... - Concentrate . - Yes . - Queen of hearts . - Okay . Watch . It 's already here . Show me ... Ace of spades . Think I know why we 're here . You 've got good hands . - Nick ! You alright ? - Yeah . What 's going on ? Sit down . - Vodka martini ? - Thank you . I 'll have one of those . She 'll have a Coke . My mom drinks when she wants to get really clear images . She 's famous for it . Maybe something without caffeine . I 've got it . Whoa . There 's five . Keep the change . Thank you . I know who you are . When I was in Division , her mother was at the top of every watch list there was . You worked for Division ? You want to know about Division ? Ten years . No thank you , no pension . I was put out on the street with a threat to not shift again . Only the sniffs caught up with me in Chicago . I was just trying to buy something nice for my wife . Next day I get a call , she 's dead . Car accident . But my wife doesn 't drive . But I don 't have to remind you how that feels , right ? - We need this . - An olive ? It 's a bead . It 's supposed to lead us to someone we need to find before Division does . Excuse me ! May I ? Thank you . You 're welcome . Got it right ? It 's a little more round and shinier . That 's it . That 's just how I saw it . It won 't last long . I 'd take it Emily Hu . She 's ex-pat sniff . Only works by referral . Here 's her address . Thank you , Hook . Bye bye . Good luck . Here it is ... Is she with someone else ? Yes I see a man ... and a boat Is she happy ? Will she come back ? It 's a very big boat . May I help you ? Hook Waters sent us . A bead that looks like this one is supposed to lead us to a girl . You with Division ? Are you looking at us ? The truth is , the girl who dropped that bead ... is supposed to have a suitcase that will bring down Division . Cassie here thinks that if we don 't find it , we die . And you believe her ? She 's pretty convincing . Well , consider me unconvinced . Looks like we 've just got to wait . For what ? You have about one minute to help us . And what 's that ? That 's your ... poster . - That 's the bead . - That 's the clock . - It 's ... right now ... - You 've got about a minute . You guys can 't be serious . Don 't look at me . This girl 's been going at it with that plan all day . Everything that ends up on this pad seems to be coming true . I just see it like I 'm looking at a photograph . Look ... we want Division out of Hong Kong ... just as much as you do . It 's going to be a whole lot easier if you help us find the girl . You remind me of someone I used to know Fine . They 've been spreading these all over the city . You 'll find who you 're looking for on Kwun Tong Pier . Excuse me ! Excuse me . Speak any English ? - No . - No . It doesn 't really matter . I just need a ride . We 're old friends , right ? I know . I should have called . Whoa , whoa ! ... - Kira ? - Dammit ! - What the hell are you doing here ? - There goes my ride ! - Don 't . - Don 't . Don 't what ? You 're the girl everyone 's looking for ? - I should kill you , Nick . - Hey ! You know this psycho ? - What happened to you ? - Now you want to know ? What does that mean ? I thought you left . You stopped returning my calls . Division caught me and locked me up . - What ? - And you never came . I looked for you . I did ! You didn 't find me . It 's done ! You had a thing . Get over it . I really suggest we discuss this somewhere else . Let 's go , Nick . Kira . Division 's looking for you . They 're looking for the case . And so are you . What 's in that case ? I don 't know . All I know is that I woke up on a boat next to a note I 'd written saying to look for you and you 'd help me find the case . I don 't remember anything about the last couple of days ... no matter how hard I try . You must have had yourself wiped . Erased memories make it harder for Division to track you . Not the ones of you . Can I talk to you for a sec ? Can it wait ? I 'm kind of in the middle of something . No . You , me , and my mom . I 've never seen my mom 's death before . It 's her , Nick . She 's changing the future , and she 's making it worse . - We 've got to dump her . - Dump her ? Cassie , we ... Cassie ! We just found her . And she doesn 't have the case . Which is what we 're looking for , - if you remember . - Yeah ! I know . We find her , we find the case . - The three of us . - Yeah , and then Division finds her . Oh yeah , the three of us . We 'll get a shadow so they can 't trace her . - Satisfied ? - No . Cassie , you 've got to trust me . I 'm not the one with the trust issues here . You better do something quick because I 'm getting sick of drawing dead bodies . That 's him . - Hey , Pinky . - Hey , Nick . - Hey . Alright , who 's feeling the heat ? Alright . Here 's how this works : I get ten grand a day for shadowing Miss Trouble . As long as she stays within twenty feet of me , no sniff is gonna find her . I don 't care if they 're standing right on top of us with a piece of her fingernail . - Happy ? - Overcome . Come on . Let 's find a place to think . So Pinky , your wife give you that name ? No , the Division did , sweetheart . Back in the day . I 'm sorry . I can 't remember anything about the case . Shocking . Can I clean up without getting killed ? Don 't forget to wash behind your ears . Nice girlfriend you 've got there . Yeah . She used to be . I met her running cons on Coney Island tourists . We did everything together . Everything . So we 're just gonna sit around and wait for her to get her memory back ... and hope that she 'll tell us where the case is before Carver gets it ? Or us . Great plan . Where you going ? I saw a chicken place downstairs . Want to come ? No , I 'm good . I want to stay here , see if I can help . Have fun with that . Where you going ? relax , Romeo . I can shade her just fine out in the hall . I don 't need to be a watcher to see where this is going . Oh ! Sorry about that . I thought the bathroom was on fire . I had to get you to come in somehow . Did you push me ? You didn 't like it ? Push back . My father expects me to find that suitcase . So does my mother . But you don 't see it clearly , do you ? Too many things keep changing . I already saw how you die . Did you see it yet ? You can change it , you know . Plenty of planes leaving Hong Kong every day . Oh , we are going to change it . You put a shadow on the girl . You know that 's only temporary . That girl is the one who brings all your little fantasies crashing down . So tell Nick something for me , little girl . Tell him my family is going to make his brain pop like a tomato . Tell him that 's the future I see . Oh , boy . Hello ? There you are . Where is the chicky-chicky ... - who gets us all killed ? - Are you drunk ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know the procedure for stopping a blitzed ten-year-old . I 'm thirteen ! And I am powering my use ! I can 't believe this . I am working . - You screw it all up ! - Alright ... Give me this . What is this ? We talked about this , Cassie . Nobody is going anywhere . - What is this ? - You don 't get it , Nick . She is the one that kills us all , basically . Then I guess we 're all gonna get killed . Yeah . Screwed up . By " we " , you mean not ... You , too . Pop Girl 's a better watcher than I am . Whoa ! No one said anything about a watcher . I can only work long-term against the sniffs . - Good . - No ! True story . You 've got a watcher after you . It 's just a matter of time . Then we 'll split up . We 'll give her two things to track instead of one . - Pinky , take Kira somewhere safe - I 'm not going with him . No offense . None taken , cupcake . I know you 're sweet on the champ . I 'll find you . Let 's let her sleep for a bit . She 's a step ahead of our sister . Father will be displeased ... She saw me coming . Maybe she 's better than you ? She still dies ! She 's gone , you know . I 'm just saying ... - You okay ? - No ... Not until we find that case . When was the last time you saw it ? Not since yesterday . Not for lack of trying , though . If we don 't find it soon , they 're gonna kill my mom . And it 's gonna be my fault . Look at me . Hey ! Look at me . You really think I 'm gonna let that happen ? You said the future 's always changing , right ? It can change just by knowing it ? It can change . It doesn 't mean it will . - Good enough . - What are you doing ? What are you gonna go do ? I 'm gonna try and make a better one . Going after Carver doesn 't change anything . It doesn 't save me , it doesn 't save you , it doesn 't save her . It 's just a matter of time , Cassie . If I don 't go to him , he 'll come for us . Emily , it 's Nick . Division sent a pusher named Carver to Hong Kong . I need you to find him . Just use that bead they gave you . I 'm sure his hands were all over it . - We 're not open . - I 'm not hungry . Henry Carver . Now there 's a face I haven 't seen in a long time . Sit down . The food is actually pretty good here . Give me one good reason not to kill you right now . Good . Gonna try and get inside my head ? Go ahead . See if you can push me before I pull the trigger . Wow ! Ten years is a long time to hold a grudge . My father would disagree . - You piece of shit . - Your father I had respect for . He took a stand with great integrity , which is more than anyone can say about you . - If this is your attempt at ... - Think I don 't know this future ? Huh ? I 've got twenty of the best watchers in the world ... tracking every moment of this time right now . You die , Nick . You all die . You know who doesn 't ? - Me . - You sure about that ? Okay . Kira is our patient zero . And with her we 're going to create an army the world 's - never seen before ... - I 'm sorry . Am I supposed to care ? Fine . Fuck patriotism . The girl will die unless she receives the necessary injections . I 636 00 : 59 : 13,663 - - 00 : 59 : 16,359 And you 're not going to find it anywhere but with me . Maybe you care about that . Tell me something , Nick . Her blood turn black yet ? No ? Insides running out ? Or is she keeping that away from you , too ? I 'll take that as a yes . You already know the ending to this story . You can only draw it so many ways . We 're going to change it . You don 't believe that , do you ? Please ... don 't make me do anything to myself . Hurting you would change the future . And I like how this future goes . So will killing him . Victor ! I think I just saved your life . There 's no need to thank me . You should just start listening to me . You look like shit . - Where is she ? - 5-A . - Is she safe ? - Yeah . She 's sick , though . Pretty bad . I need to ask you a question . What 's in the case ? It 's a drug . Some sort of psychic steroid that boosts our abilities ... but kills us . They want me back because I 'm the only one ... who survived the injection . Tell me why I just drew a picture of me holding her shoe . Is she okay ? What ? No . You 've got to be kidding me . - She 's dying . - You are not bringing me into this . You 're already in it . We need to know what this key unlocks . Please . Cassie , how much do the Chinese know ? Whatever we do . It could be more . Their watcher is better than me . We know there 's a suitcase with a Division drug in it . Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong . Can you draw us a way out of this ? We can 't change anything with that bitch tracking us . The second we do , she 's gonna see it . - What do you mean ? - She sees intentions . What we decide to do . I decide to cross the street , so she sees me crossing the street . What if nothing we did made sense ? Or we just kept changing our mind , we didn 't know exactly what we were gonna do ? Would that throw her off ? It might , but we still have to find the case . Whatever this key unlocks is being shadowed . Like I 've never seen before . It 's this way . That really narrows it down . If it 's shadowed , I won 't be able to draw . There 's a building missing . I thought shadows weren 't supposed to be effective against watchers like Cassie . They 're not . We 're not supposed to be able to shade entire buildings either . You wanted to see me ? I 'm going to need your help . Watchers from everywhere are tracking us . Carver ... the Chinese ... Anything we think we 're gonna do , they know about it . That 's why we all keep dying in Cassie 's book . - Pardon ? - You die outside an elevator . Oh . How are we gonna make the future unpredictable ? By not knowing what we 're gonna do until right before we do it . - Like a plan without planning . - Yes . Right . Okay ! I 'll write letters to each of you giving you specific instruction . You don 't open them until I tell you . Then the last letter , I write to myself ... and wipe the memory of ever having written them . That 's why I need you to find the guy that wiped Kira . - Sure thing . - That sounds like a great plan . - Do you have a better one ? - We 're flying blind . Yeah . Cassie ... I need one more drawing out of you . I need to know the exact size and shape of that case . And that syringe . Our watchers say it is already here . Father ... I know what Division is looking for ... It 's a syringe . with this drug we 'll be more powerful than Division . The girl will die unless she receives the necessary injections . You 're not going to find the stuff anywhere but with me . You die , Nick . You all die . You need the medicine that Carver has . I 'm not gonna watch you die . I 'll come back for you . I promise . When do I open it ? When you start to doubt the truth . - You know when to open these . - You sure this is right ? No . Nick ? Take an umbrella . It 's gonna rain . You be careful , too . You make us chase you halfway across the world ... then you let a hack Like Pinky Stein bring you in ? - I 'm sick . - You 're sick ? You don 't know what you are . Victor , pay the man . Of course . I knew I wouldn 't get paid yet . Wait here . Were you followed ? I 'm never followed . Where is this guy ? - Which one ? - The yellow one . - The big one ? - Yep . Wo Chiang ? You are here about the girl ? You 're the one that wiped Kira ? 12 years ago , a woman told me an American girl would come . That was two days ago , Kira showed . I have a job for you . Two hours ago , I wrote seven letters . I need you to erase the memory of ever having written them . Seven letters , two hours of memory . The woman tell me those things . She did not pay for you , too . And when you 're done , I need you to open this and read it . 7 : 34 - I need a minute . - As you wish . I 'm not gonna wake up and forget who I am , am I ? 7 : 34 ... 7 : 35 Wait , wait . No , just ... go . It 's all gone . The future has ... disappeared . I lost the connection . Halt . Identification ? Safety inspector ... I need to know where the security lockers are . Certainly , sir . Go up the elevator ... to the top floor . - Up this way ? - Yes , sir . No problem . 4,100 The job is over . You don 't have to shadow the building anymore . The girl sent me ... " 4,100 " Thank you . You ready ? Right size , right shape . No problem . Better hurry . Won 't last long . Crap . The Lord giveth . Did you really think you could slip out of town with this ? Tell me , was this worth dying for ? No . He dies slowly . Your sister promised me that and a great deal of money . Do you know how many people in the world would kill for this drug ? Now ... Where is Cassie ? Get me back on my feet . Perhaps the Pop family can 't be relied upon . Didn 't see that one coming , did you ? Do you really want to do this , little girl ? I know where the drug is . More importantly , I know how you die . Do you want to know what the tiger means ? The drug is here . See if that will make him love you . My note says I 'm supposed to tell you ... the Division has Kira . 216 Batang Street . It said a lot on there . Was everyone 's that complicated ? I knew you could handle it . This immuno-suppressant will save your life and allow you to reach your full potential . You 're going to be a better you , Kira . You need to accept this reality . We 're not trying to hurt you . Kira . Matter of fact , your well being means everything to us . Understand it 's not your fault you 're forgetting who you are and running from us . The drug has side effects . We have no way of knowing the severity . I want you to know that I blame myself for that , Agent Hollis . This isn 't real . You volunteered , Kira . I was against it . You were certain you 'd be the one to survive the drug . I had to support you . After all , we were partners . Then you panicked . Did you think you made it all the way here ... and eluded us for so long without any training ? That 's the Division in you . Kira . Now let me help you remember . Let me help you remember . I keep trying to draw something different , but I can 't . It 's something to do with how I die . It 's a tiger . I 'm serious . I don 't know how I know , but I just know . I know I act like I don 't care sometimes , - but I don 't want to die . - Cassie ... It 's not gonna happen , okay ? Just tell me that I 'm a crappy artist and that I 'm wrong . You are a crappy artist and you are wrong . Listen to me . You 've already done more than enough for everyone . The only thing you 've got to worry about right now - is keeping yourself safe . - But how ? Just start walking . Don 't even think about where you 're going . Just keep moving . And don 't make any decisions any watcher can track . And when you come across someplace safe , you hide . Simple as that . I don 't know how , but I know this is gonna work out . I promise . No need to be scared . Trust me . That 's more like it . What are you gonna do ? I can 't tell you . You make me look like a fool in front of my family ! Don 't worry . You won 't remember a thing . Your mother 's very proud . I want to make a deal . The drug for the girl . Okay . Dock 4 , Man Yuen Street . Where is the case , Nick ? Kira ! Go ahead . Remember that night under the roller coaster ? We parked in the rain and got those little bottles of Jack . That was the first time you told me you loved me . He remembers . I want to hear it from him . I remember . It never happened . We met for the first time yesterday . You 've never been to Coney Island . Nobody 's been to Coney Island . I used you , Nick . And the quicker we find that case , the quicker I 'll let you forget it . You might as well . My card says you have to take the drug . Give me Carver . It 's for you . - Hello ! - You want the case , you let them live . I 'll tell you exactly where it is . - Another ? - Sure . One for the road . Don 't feel too bad . That push of Kira 's has worked on better men . 4,100 Kill him . If that 's alright with you ? The case ... Agent Carver . The contents of this case are the property of the United States government . Government ? We are the only government here . Be reasonable . There is no need for anyone to die . We 're not much for diplomacy these days . Victor ! Make me a way out of here ! Kira ! Kira ! Kira ... Whoa ! I 'm impressed . The engineers are always conservative with their projections ... but this is something else . Hey ! We are on the same side . Remember ? Now why don 't you march the men who tried to kill us off this roof , and we 'll call it a day . Wait ! Kira ! Don 't do this ! It 's a push . What Carver told you is a lie . I 'm sure they make a card for this . Where were we ? Where were we ? You don 't want to do that . Watch me . You 'd be doing me a favor if you did . What 's in that needle will kill you . I went through hundreds of potentials to find her . She 's our survival . Look at me . You know me . I know you . Look at me ... Look at me . Let him do it . What a waste . I told you to bring an umbrella . Thought you said it was gonna rain . I also told you I get things wrong sometimes . Maybe it will wash the crap out of your hair . So where 's the real case ? There it is . How long do you think your mother has been planning this ? Since before I was born . This is the key , Nick . Division will do anything to keep this from getting into the wrong hands . So we trade your mom for the drug ? I 'm still working on that one . Hey , what was it that I injected myself with ? Nine Dragon Soy Sauce . That 's gross . What about Kira ? You 're the watcher . You tell me . Don 't worry . We 'll see Miss Trouble soon enough . When do I open it ? When you start to doubt the truth . Put your gun in your mouth . Pull the trigger .

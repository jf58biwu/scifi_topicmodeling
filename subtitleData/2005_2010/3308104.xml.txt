 It all started in the year 2045 ... A worldwide depression resulted in civil wars all over Europe . Chaos ruled the streets States were no more . The bloody battles would rage on for decades It felt like time standing still Countless achievements of civilization would just dwindle away Future became history Even state of the art weaponry would be forgotten over time . It was then , a gruesome warlord would discover the power of the martial arts . Using this power , he would create an army to triumph in endless battles . The warlord knew well about the power of the martial arts But the highest form of the martial arts would remain hidden from him ... . Because the elder masters could tell his evilness and thus would refuse to teach him . So he decided to wipe their secret skills off the face of the earth for good He would hunt them down mercilessly Almost all of the elder masters were killed then My master once said : ' The well must be built ... before drought befalls the land That is why the elder masters would write down their secret arts in a book My master would keep it safe He was the last of the masters and I was his last student No ! Master ! No ... Thank you for everything . Are you sure you dont want to come with me ? I cant . If you ever drop by ... - I`ll mow the lawn . ... there are supplies in the basement . Take ´ em . I will be alright . There is nothing more you can do for him . There`s one thing ; I can bury him . Linda had saved my life But I was bound to recover the book my master has lived and died for This book was his most priceless possession and his teachings would live on with it . I just had to get it back . It was the same city altogether . But still ... . like a field of ruins tyrannized by a cloud of evil Where is she ? Where is she ? - I`m not seeing anyone around here . - You must be the slow-witted type ! You better start talking ; or my men will break every fuckin bone in your body Wouldnt you agree this is a bit unfair ? Six against one ? But that`s fine with me . In fact , its my pleasure . Are we gonna do this now ? Kill him ! Hey , cool it man . I am cool , man . You`re as good as dead . Are you okay ? Keep your gratitude for another day , i mean ... . you could have taken care of ´ em on your own , right ? ! . Thanks anyway . You`re welcome . What did they want from you ? You`re not from around here , huh ? ! Well ... I was gone for a while . So , what did they want from you ? Its not what they want , its what Bosco wants . Bosco . Bullshit ! Jonas is dead . I swear he`s alive ! Jonas Klingenberg is dead . Have I made myself clear ? Lieutenant . Affirmative , my leader . I dont want to fight with you . All I want is the manual . - And I am willing to pay any price . - Nothing is worth that much . - Then take me as your student . - I already have a student . Not anymore . Let`s begin with the lesson . Bosco had killed my master and taken the book . I had every reason to take revenge . By the end of the civil war the entire land was controlled by the warlord . He felt invincible and would challenge my master . It was his deep-rooted mad desire to triumph over my master . But the warlord would underestimate my master , and so he would die by my master`s hand . And his almighty power would collapse . But the hatred that had fueled him would survive through his children Bosco and Kleo . Is it true ? Jonas is still alive ? How dare you keep that from me ? He will be coming here for his master`s manual . We can`t allow that to happen , ever . It was me who led you to the manual . So , listen to me carefully . If Jonas is still alive , its your fault alone . Right , keep holding on to that straw . - It won`t help you . - Don`t you worry . It will . - It is perfect . - But you ain`t . October , 4th : I am making progress . Nevertheless , many chapters remain a mystery to me . One thing seems certain though , Father had underestimated the ancient traditions . But I am confident the secrets of the manual will reveal themselves to me soon . Soon my students will be unbeatable . Over there ! Move it ! Freeze ! Move it you scumbags ! Brace yourselves ! Keep it up ! Hurry ! Get your act together . After him . Come on ! Pass me the fuckin flashlight ! Fuck . What kind of shit is that ? Jonas ! Don`t be a coward and show yourself I`ll dump a load on your master`s grave Keep searching ! Somebody should have watched his steps Must be my lucky day . Check it out guys . No soldiers here . Look up in the sky ... Hmm , not sure . Certainly doesnt look like a bird - Now what are we gonna do with him ? - How about cutting me loose ? - We could . - But we dont want to . First things first , pay the toll . This is our bunker . But I dont have anything . Your gear , your boots ... It serves a good cause . And what would that be ? My boys dont get their feet wet . Get him down . Strip ! Strip . Someone`s looking for trouble . - Well guess what , you found it , buddy . - I`m not your buddy . Unfortunate for you . Show him what you got , Vinz . Do me a favour . I dont want any bloodstains on my new shoes . That`s really one nice staff . Let`s try something new . Your fist is quite good , buddy . Can I keep my shoes now ? The colour doesnt suit me anyhow . Let me introduce you to ... Malte . Frank , Ono . Marie . And this is my brother Vinzent . I`m Jonas . Kleo ... I`ve started to wonder whether or not you like me anymore . Have I ever been mad with you ? So ... are there any new developments ? My men will find him eventually . Your men are fuckin pussies ! You should know best . Send your new apprentices . - Their training isnt completed yet . - Bullshit . - Its the manual`s secrets still hidden from you - Make no mistake , I`m getting there ! Some things take their time , until they rise and shine . You start to sound like the old man . It was you who led me to him . Yes , to eradicate him and his kind ! Those impotent old fools and their weak minded teachings They shall burn in hell for all I care ! Father would be so proud of you . You must avenge father . Don`t you worry . Soon , Jonas will join his master . I hope so . He doesnt stand a chance . The manual`s secrets will help me build the most powerful army on earth Our late father`s kingdom will rise from the ashes again Under my command . - You meant to say ' our command ' ... - Ain`t that right ... brother ! ? ! Certainly . Yes ... bloody hell . Chill ... thats what I meant to say . Goddammit . You will come crawling back to me ... That spoiled bitch . Take a seat . Grab some food ! Why are you hiding out here ? We deserted . Deserters ! ? Bosco had forced us to join . He would force obedience upon his troops ? Mindbending . His soldiers must suffer a great deal , until they`re trained to do just anything . Why don`t you fight back ? No way in hell , man . He occupies an entire army . We dont stand a chance against them . Do you know where I can find Bosco ? On the southside of town . He made it his playground when everybody had abandoned their homes . Alright . Thanks for dinner . Hey - getting in is one thing ... Getting out is the tricky part . We`ll see . - Who do you think you are ? Rambo ? - Wasnt Rambo a little girl ? We meet again . It`s that way What if he`s a snitch ? Then we`ll have Bosco`s guys all over our asses . This guy knows our hideout now . He is not a snitch . - Drink up bitches ! - Drink up bitch ! Looking for this ? Your master has wasted his time on you ! Looking for this ? - Vinz ! - Get the manual , I`ll keep him busy . Let`s get out of here ! Alarm ! Now what ? Jump , slump , and when you hit the ground ... you roll over . - That`s just great . - Here we go . One ... two ... three ! Pass me that ! Thanks . So , was it worth our while ? You have no idea . Damn , I was beginning to think this is a cookbook of sorts Why would you say that ? You know ... Frank`s dishes start bugging me the hell out Go ahead and curl up . Hey Malte , everything cool ? Hey , what`s your problem ? You go out risking our lives for some ... book It means a lot to him . But nothing to us ! Bosco will tear us to shreds for that stunt . Guess we`ll find out . What do you mean " we`ll find out " ? I have no intentions to get myself killed . Chill . Cant get any worse anyways . Go underground , dont draw any attention - werent those your exact words once ? We can`t just dwell in this place for all eternity . You know , she`s right , man . We can`t keep this up forever . If you say so ... . That doesnt sound like him at all . He`ll be calming down . Don`t bother . And what are we gonna do about him ? He`s cool . He`s one of us now . Found your path of enlightenment yet , buddy ? - I`m on my way . - Mind taking a little detour over here ? Thank you . Read something from the manual . Sorry , no can do . Why not ? This manual was written by different masters . Each would use their own secret characters . My master would teach me the meaning of all these symbols ... But I dont know how to pronounce ´ em . Sounds like some freaky-deaky shit to me . So what`s their meaning ? They describe the highest form of the martial arts . I see why Bosco is after the manual . He`s constantly looking for ways to making life harder for us . Great powers are hidden within this manual It is my duty to keep it safe from evil forces . - Can you teach me ? - i dunno ... The manual`s gone . And what about Jonas ? Same . Now how could that happen ? I don`t know ! Someone is helping him . - Then change your strategy . - Change how ? Cut off those ruin dwellers` winter supplies What good is that gonna do ? Either they bring us Jonas or they will starve to death . What if they refuse to cooperate ? Less dwellers ! What ? Do you want to shoot me ? Or fuck me ? Why can`t I have both ? Do you know Jonas Klingenberg ? - No . - Then see into making his acquaintance . Burn it all down . Retreat ! Hey , what`s this ? An ingredient from yesterdays` stew ? Don`t hate , that`s some nutritious stuff right there . - Nutritious my ass . Tastes like shit ! - You dont know what you`re talking about ! Hey Vinz , Dude , we got a problem . - What`s up with you guys ? - Are you Jonas Klingenberg ? That would be me . You bitch ! I`ll smack your ass , you bastard ! Easy now . Let me talk to him . Bosco 's henchmen would attack us all because of you . Haven`t I told you he`s nothing but trouble ! - You can have him . - Cut it out . - What`s your name ? - I go by Ben . This is Gregor , my brother . What ´ s really on your minds ? All we want is to survive . - Then join us . - Now what is that all about ? We`re gonna get back what they took from you . And how are we gonna do that ? Hijack them . You really want to play in a mine field ! Who said anything about ' playing ' ? But we`re outnumbered by Bosco`s troops We wouldn`t stand a chance . This manual is our chance . So what you`re saying is ... there`s a chance we can beat ´ em ? ! Relying on a cookbook . Damn straight . Okay , then what are we waiting for ? ! My master would say : " I can teach you . But the secret is within your heart . It is for you to control your chi . Not the other way around . Let your chi flow , calm like soft breeze Your heart shall burn like the sun . These are the ways to succeed Practise your Gung , make use of it until you won`t need it anymore and then , rid yourself of all shackles . Then you will become one with the elements for they are the last ones to serve the arts . " October , 11th : Now that the enemy knows about the secret arts ... Power and strength of the chi will decide the outcome . I`m dedicated to fight this battle until my final breath . To reign supreme ... or fade to black . My master would say : 'It`s the hard way leading to the top ' . 'And if your chi flows like a river there is no stopping its way ' . - Help me ! - Shut the hell up , bitch ! You better check upstairs ! If you want to be free then join us in our cause . It`s on baby , proceed to round two . - Report . - No leads so far . If you don`t mind me asking - Why not ? Jonas ambushes my patrols . He`s taking all the supplies giving them back to the people . He has their full support . i don`t give a rat`s ass support or no support . But if you won`t stop spoiling my mood with all that bullshit then I will dispose of you . Understood . Hey , what`s up Malte ? Something bothering you ? What are you pulling a face for ? Things are going smooth like silk . We`re just lucky . It won`t last forever . Ease up , baby bro . Bosco will strike the sails in no time . Spotted the patrols . Let`s get busy . I`m not coming this time . C 'mon , don`t be like that ! Time for some action . Break a leg . I just can`t pull it off anymore . I`m sorry It`s okay . - Step on it . - What ? I told you to step on it ! Let`s play like big boys ! - He won`t stop . Sit tight , he will ! - Don`t do it . - Get the fuck out of the way ! - Out of the way , you cocksuckers . You ´ re not wimping out here ! Out of the damn way ! It`s an ambush . All troops commence combat position ! Incompetent . - Keep a little something for me , will ya . - Dude , you ´ re still digesting yesterdays` feast . Just my efforts to assure quality . Do we need yet another Lieutenant ? Keep this up and you`ll wear out more men than your sis does Shut your trap . Who is this ? - One of Jonas` people . - Have mercy . Somebody had to do something . What does he know ? - Everything . - Good . If I find out you lied ... I`ll cut off your balls and boil ´ em . Then we should seize the day while we can . Did my sister show her gratitude to you already ? - For what ? - Uh , saving her life of course . Not exactly . I`d be looking into that if I were you . Play nice though . Or else ... her brother just might run into you . I know how to protect myself . It`s pretty crowded in here , huh ! ? - Wanna join me for a walk ? - Sure . When are you going to admit you have a crush on me ? Who says I have a crush on you ? Your eyes . Is that so ? ! So , how about it ? It`s still so fresh . At least you admit it . You ... are a great dancer . Thanks . Are you happy ? I`m not sure but I think I am . Have you seen Malte ? I have no idea where he could be . Assault . Everybody run ! Come and get me , freak boy . Bosco ... There`s a raging thunderstorm ... Lightning strikes ... Who`s there ? I`m the king`s servant . Sent to Nimes as a courier . Regal . You know the king`s garment Does the donzel know his whereabouts ? Speak up ! - He`s out food-shopping . - Confess ! If you wanna play like that ... Fuck your momma and your sister Release him to me ! Fuck that shit ! What do I care about your fuckin donzel ! ? He remains silent . Whatever ... The naked feet , they will be mine to set ablaze He squirms . Blazing fire everywhere . Absorbing thee . You`re one sick freak , old man . Tomorrow ; by the fire ... I will tell you how the story ended . That`s just great . A house full of psychos . So ... you`d fail . Jonas wasn`t there . It can`t be . Please. i swear . Hit him ! What are you doing ? I`ve got to look for Vinzent . Maybe he is still alive . Let`s roll . You owe me one if Jonas won`t show . He will come . Men are like dogs . Dogs ? Give a dog a bone and they`ll drool all over it . Proceed . The outfit . As soon as I am in position you make some noise . Once they`re diverted I`m getting him out of there . Roger that . Be careful you . So , what`s up with that donzel of yours ? You`re smart and level-headed , Sir . Knowing I am servant to the highest of all kings . You murdered my wife ! God raises his voice Revenge be mine . I got my own revenge you bastard ! Set the naked feet ablaze . - Any last words ? - Suck a cock you freaks . Is that all you got ? Enough with the sweet talk . I want to see him burn . Get ready ! Get ready ! What became of " men are like dogs " ? Don`t you give me that look . Take her upstairs . Torch him ! Jonas ! Hurry up man ! Get me out of here . What are you idiots waiting for ? ! I want his head on a platter ! Time to retreat , dear brother . You`ll pay for this ! Mark my words ! Send my apprentices . Behold the crest ! Behold the chamber ! Raving madness , exegesis ! They have Marie . They got us by the balls . Come on ! I got you a front row ticket . So far , so good , so what now ? Attack on the flanks , I take the left , you take the right . Sounds like a plan . Now I can finally avenge my father . I `ve summoned my best student . He will crush you . Do you recognize your master`s style ? My student knows all the things that his student knows . And he`s much stronger than you are . I`ve really had it with you fools . - Welcome . - I`m not welcome in here . Better tell me where my sister is or i`ll smack the ... ..... What are you in the mood for now ? Want to kill me ? Or fuck me ? What was option no.1 again ? Wrong answer . You could never live up to my master`s . God , I feel like throwing up . Who wants to go first ? You asked for it . Vinzent . Look , people are coming back home again . There`s someone I want to introduce you to . - Oh , who is it ? My guardian angel . And so the reign of Bosco and Kleo would come to an end . People would return to their homes Embracing freedom and peace ... . ... making an effort to rebuild the city from the ruins The tyrant`s castle was turned into a martial arts school teaching the ways of my late master .

 I-I got the virus . I wasn 't immune . We 're beaming everything we record here to any communications satellite we can find . Maybe there 's someone out there , watching . Are you a doctor ? I don 't want the others to know . You saved my life , Anya . That makes us connected . Ah . Ah ! No ! 'Can you feel His presence ? 'Do you hear Him calling His children ? 'Yes . 'Do you hear the wind whispering your name ? 'Yes . 'Once all I heard were aeroplanes and cars 'and radios and computers and televisions , ' great babble of voices filling my head with so much noise I thought it might burst . And then , the great silence came and there was only Him at last , whispering to me gently of His infinite love . He told me , walk away from the cities of the dead and build a new world , a decent place where all His children live in peace and harmony with the Earth . Follow me and I 'll take you home . How are the blood samples ? She has a high number of antibodies , but there 's nothing unusual in the immune response . It 's what I 'd expect to see in a normal flu virus . - What about the lung biopsy ? - The same . You 're not looking closely enough at the lungs . There may be more virus damage there . The immune response could be clearer . It 's possible . But that would require a post-mortem . And she isn 't dead . Prepare the lab for pathology . You heard what I said . What 's your name ? Najid . We have nothing worth stealing . I 'm not a thief . We saw you sneaking around . I wasn 't sneaking , I live here . Are you a preacher ? In a way . What religion are you ? All religions and none . Do you believe in God , Najid ? Of course ! I wish everyone was like you . My job would be a lot easier . We 've met a lot of thieves on our travels . But we rushed to judgment on an innocent , and that was very wrong . Sorry , son . You should meet my friends . This place isn 't safe . We need a proper security rota . We 're wasting time . We should be planning how we 're gonna live , not just today and tomorrow , but for the next 20 years . And what if the others don 't want to ? They don 't know what they want . They 're waiting for you to tell them . - I don 't want that responsibility . - You 've got it . But this isn 't gonna work if you run off every five minutes looking for Peter . That 's not fair . When are you going to accept he 's gone ? When I know for sure . And what if you never do ? That was lovely . I 'd forgotten how much fun sex can be . If you want someone to tell you how beautiful you are , I 'm not the one . I 'm starting to wonder if you even like me . - Sure you want me to answer that ? - Ugh ! Hey , it 's OK , I 'm just kidding . I really like you , Tom . Naj ? Naj ! Naj ! Naj ? Where are you ? Let him go ! It 's all right , Anya . They 're OK , honest . - What do you want ? - I 'm John . They 're good people . You shouldn 't have brought them to the house . We didn 't have much choice . He 's a nice guy . Some sort of preacher . That 's reassuring ( ! ) They 've been sleeping rough . I know , Naj , it 's just we have to be so careful . They just need somewhere to stay for a bit , that 's all . It 's not a good idea . There you go , guys . Thank you . Oh , how many weeks ? 38 . My first two kids were both early , Aren 't you scared about having a baby now ? Why ? It 's the most natural thing in the world . And John says nothing will go wrong . Well , I 'd still fancy having a doctor for back-up . Well , that 's because you don 't trust in a higher power . Don 't you start . I get enough of that from Naj . But I 'm always open to a theological discussion . What 's he doing ? He 's talking to God . You mean praying ? If you like . What are you looking at ? There are patterns in everything . You just have to know how to read them . What is it that you need from us ? Nothing you don 't want to give us . That 's not an answer . My people are tired and hungry . Your people ? My family , friends . I don 't know what else to call them . Najid said that you were some kind of preacher . Is that what you were before ? I was an architect . I used to build car parks . That 's not important now . Linda 's baby is due . We 'd like to rest here until it 's born . I think it 's a stupid risk , we don 't know anything about ' em . All that New Age religious stuff , it just gives me the creeps . He seems harmless enough . I don 't want them here . Linda 's nine months pregnant . That 's her problem . OK . Hands up who wants them to go . And in favour of letting them stay ? I know why you 're on their side . Just doing the Christian thing . - You 're a Muslim . - Figure of speech . We can 't spare the resources . We can manage . Look , these people need our help . All right . But just until the baby 's born . OK , with Naj , that 's four to three . Oh , come on ! He doesn 't get a vote , he 's just a kid . He has the same rights as the rest of us . All of a sudden we 're a democracy , are we ? You 're making a mistake . This is lovely . Isn 't the furniture nice , John ? Yes . Thank you . I know your food and water are precious . Oh , we can spare it . For a few days . You 're a good man , Greg . I can see it . Don 't count on it . Look , anything you need , you just shout , OK ? Don 't worry about me . I 've done this before . I can pop them out like shelling peas . Do you really believe all that God stuff ? God , nature , call it what you want . John is a prophet . Every word he says is true and beautiful . Such as ? The Earth was out of balance . We abused our environment and destroyed the harmony of nature . The virus was our punishment . Like Noah 's flood . Only not as wet . Oh , come on ! You really believe that ? If you listen to John , it all makes sense . He made me see how beautiful the world is , how life could be good again , maybe even better than it was before . Look , why do you hate me ? I don 't know you . But you don 't want me here . No . Why not ? Because you 're exploiting some very vulnerable and traumatised people . You have such sadness , Anya . I can see it in you . Is that supposed to qualify as an insight ? I had family and friends , lovers , And the virus took that away from me . Yes , I 'm sad . But you feel your sadness will overwhelm you and every day it gets worse . I can help you live again . Get away from me . Did the creep try something on ? You say the word , I 'll break his neck . That 's very chivalrous . Don 't make fun of me . I 'm not . Tom ? Do you ever think it might have been better not to have survived the virus ? No . Not for a second . I can feel it kicking ! My first two were girls , so I 'm saying boy this time . Here . Look , don 't fuss , John . I 'm not sick , I 'm having a baby . I wish there was more we could do for you . Don 't worry . God told me nothing will go wrong . How did He tell you ? By talking to me . How many babies has God delivered ? What do you believe in , Abby , if you don 't believe in God ? Come on , Naj . Linda needs to rest . The truth frightens you . You don 't give up easily , do you ? You really believe He talks to you ? I hear Him as clearly as talking to you now . And how do you know it 's God ? How many other invisible , supernatural beings are there ? You don 't have to call it God if it makes you uncomfortable . It 's just a word for something greater than ourselves and that 's all . There 's such beauty in the world . If only we could all learn to embrace it . It 's a strange time to talk about beauty when people have lost everything . We can wither in grief , or we can choose to live again . Which would you prefer ? Have you , um ... have you met many other survivors on the road ? A few groups , here and there . Were there any boys ? About 12 years old ? Your son ? Yeah . Er , a handful . I 'm sorry , I didn 't ask any names . What makes you think he 's alive ? Instinct ... Hope , I don 't know . But you feel it deep inside . A conviction that he 's not dead . Some days I 'm so certain . Well , perhaps , then , Abby , God talks to you as well . You just don 't recognise His voice . Louise ? Louise ? Hi . I just wondered if ... .. if you fancied a nightcap . I don 't drink . Oh . But we can make love , if you like . What 's the scam ? I don 't understand . What is it ? The house ? The food ? What ? You might be able to fool your little gang of misfits and losers , but I don 't buy into it . There 's so much hatred in your heart . But God still loves you . Do your friends know the kind of man you are , Tom ? Have you ever shown them your true face ? You don 't know when to shut up , do you ? You can 't hide your nature forever . But you can still ... be a better man . Yeah , maybe . Not just yet . Does anyone actually know how to do this ? Having a baby doesn 't make you an expert in delivering them . There 's no need to worry . Everything will be fine . God told you . Yes , we know . You just ... you just keep believing that . I 've never been camping before . I could get used to it . You could join us . We could be together all the time . Early days , darling . Let 's take it one step at a time , eh ? Hey , hey , excuse me . Easy , mate ! - This is private . - Did you have a good night ? Yes , thanks , since you ask . What the hell was that about ? Mike 's my boyfriend . He was probably just checking up on me . Excuse me ? Oh , don 't worry . I don 't keep any secrets from him . This whole thing was his idea anyway . Um , what ? The world needs children now . The more men I sleep with , the more chance I have of getting pregnant . That 's why you slept with me ? You wanted me and I want to have a baby . What 's wrong with that ? I thought you liked me ! I do . You used me ! This is seriously out of order . - Why isn 't the baby coming ? - Something 's wrong . You ... you 'll be fine . She needs help . You 're a doctor . I was . I 'm not now . What does that mean ? It means I can 't help . I don 't care whether she lives or dies . She means nothing to me . Just ask yourself how you 'll feel if something goes wrong . Please , John . Do something . I 'll pray . Lie down . Oh , God ! You 're doing really well . My head hurts and I 'm too hot and there 's a lump . Oh , Jenny ! - It 's all right , I 'm a doctor . - What ? Anya ! Did you know about this ? It 's news to me . Ow ! What did you say you did before ? Systems analyst . Well , that 's handy ( ! ) It 's a breech . The baby 's coming out bottom first . Will it be all right ? It 's too late to do an ECV . I can 't turn the baby , it 'll rupture the uterus . I need a midwife . Anya ... I need a midwife ! I 'm sorry , I can 't do this . If you don 't go back in there , she might die . I 'm not qualified to handle a breech . You have to do this . I can 't . That night ... I watched them all die ... .. one after another , until they all died , and there was nothing I could do to help them . Anya , listen to me . Listen to me . You cannot blame yourself for that . There was no cure , no-one could help . I held her in my arms ... .. this woman I 'd held so many times before . She was my friend and my lover and she begged me to help her and I couldn 't do it . I watched the life drain out of her . I couldn 't save her . OK . But you can save someone now . I can 't , she 'll die . God sent you to us . He won 't desert you now . What about Pat and Jenny ? What about all the others ? Why did he desert them ? Listen , listen , listen . You know , maybe he 's right . Maybe there 's some mad reason for all this . So you just do it for all the people that you loved . OK ? You do it for yourself . OK , Linda . You 're fully dilated , the baby 's ready . You 're going to be fine . Yes . Yes . I can 't feel the cord . That 's good . Help us , God . As soon as you feel a contraction , I want you to push as hard as you can , and let me worry about everything else . Come on , Linda , breathe ! That 's good . I am so never having a baby . Good girl . Can I get you anything , Tom ? Is she all right ? She is now . Anya 's a doctor . You already knew , didn 't you ? That 's it ! That 's it , it 's coming . - Come on , Linda . - That 's fantastic . Thank you , God . It 's a boy . Is he all right ? Well done . He 's fine , he 's perfect . Linda ? Linda ! Linda ! Linda ? ! She 's crashing ! She must have some kind of heart condition . Linda ! Linda ! She can 't ... she can 't die . Please ! Please , God . Linda . Linda ! Anya ? Anya ! Get him away from her . John , John , come on , let us help her . Come on ! We 're gonna help her . Don 't , please ! Get her down the bed . Ssshh-ssshh . I am not losing you . She 's back . It 's getting stronger . I got her back . I got her back ! Thank you ! Thank you , God . Well done , Anya . This one 's for Abby . And I 'll get you a vodka . Just kidding . Oh , thank you . So , how 's he doing ? Healthy and strong . Will he be immune to the virus ? Linda was . So with any luck , he 'll inherit it from her . Maybe it 's gone now anyway . Hmm . Something tells me this little one 's going to live . We really don 't know anything about each other , do we ? We 've lived together all these weeks and ... and we 're still strangers . Maybe it 's better that way . You like to think you don 't need anyone , but you do . - Oh , you 're psychoanalysing me now ? - Somebody should . Somebody has . You were in therapy ? Yeah , for about a year . What are you looking at me like that for ? Well , you just don 't seem the type . I mean , did you , um ... did you actually talk ? No , not much . You know what I 've noticed ? That you don 't say much about leaving any more . Doesn 't mean I 'm not still thinking about it . You wouldn 't be getting attached to us , would you ? There you go . Cheers . I thought you didn 't drink . It 's a special occasion . I 'm sorry . I should have told you . I do like you , Al . Really . I want us to be friends . What kind of friends ? Are you talking to God now ? I don 't understand the pattern . I 've been counting the bubbles . Every one means something . I just don 't know what yet . Are you OK ? John 's talking to God in his champagne glass . I think he 's drunk . Are you coming to the party , Tom ? Tom ? Why didn 't you tell me you were a dyke ? Sorry ... lesbian . That 's a nice word for it , innit ? All that stuff you were saying about the ... woman you love . It made me want to throw up . I don 't have to justify my life to you . Well , I like to know who I 'm dealing with . You want to know what we did together ? Tom , is that it ? Shall I tell you the details so you can play them over in your mind like some dirty little pornographic movie ? Will you stop it ? ! I fell in love with a girl . I didn 't expect it . I didn 't plan it . It just happened . And for a while , it was great . And then it ended . It just didn 't work any more . Maybe I am a lesbian . Maybe I 'm not . I didn 't have a chance to find out . I think I 'd know if I was a queer . I don 't fall in love with women , Tom , or men . I fall in love with people . You 've been with blokes ? Yes , I 've been with blokes . Does that make you feel better ? Get out . Does it matter who we sleep with , Tom ? Does it really matter ? Just ask yourself one thing . Why are you so angry ? John ? John ? We have to protect the baby . Of course we will . God spoke to me . What did He say ? I couldn 't hear Him . Don 't , don 't do that , love . I couldn 't hear Him over the other voices . You 're tired . You need to rest . I can 't rest ! I can 't sleep ! Lie down here . You 'll sleep next to me . You always do . They want to hurt the baby . Who does ? No-one wants to hurt the baby . You 're imagining it . The voices told me . But we know they 're not real , don 't we ? Only God 's voice is real . Mike looked after me when I first joined . He looks after everyone . He helps us find food and places to live . He 's a good man . But you don 't love him . I want to . You 're sure he 's OK about this ? He doesn 't know . I told him you and I were finished . Seeing us together upset him . He changed his mind . He wants me to have a baby , but he wants it to be his . We 'll be leaving soon . Come with us . What about Mike ? He 'll have to accept it . I 'm sorry . I don 't think it 's going to happen . - I thought you liked me . - I do . I do . Listen , if you want to hang out here for a while , that 's great , we 've got plenty of room . I can 't leave John . I love him . You 're certainly spreading your love , aren 't you , darling ? Not like that . He knows things . He made me see how everything happens for a reason . Well , it 's a pity . It might have been fun . You know what ? You need to get away . Make your own life . - If I leave John , I 'll have nothing . - You 're frightened . We all were for a while . You just latched on to the first person that tried to make any sense out of anything . You know he 's full of crap , don 't you ? See you later . - What 's going on with you and Tom ? - Why don 't you ask him ? You 've had your chance . Stay away . It 's not funny . Trust me , if you knew what we were talking about , it really is . Oh ... Oh , oh . There , there , there , sshhhhh . It 's OK . Oh , there , there , there , there , sshhhh . Give him to me ! Oh , sorry . He was crying . You can 't have him ! - John , what 's going on ? - She was trying to steal the baby . What ? That 's ridiculous . You want him to replace the son you lost . She didn 't mean any harm . She was trying to help . - You can 't have him ! - Please , just go . John , John . You shouldn 't have messed with that girl . Louise wouldn 't do something like this . - And you didn 't have an argument ? - No . Not really . No ! All right , that 's it . I want them out . Thank you . - And don 't say I told you so . - Linda can 't travel yet . I need to watch her for another few days at least . I could be dead by then ! - Don 't forget to lock your door . - All right , they can stay . But only until Linda 's better . Will Linda be all right ? If she has a heart condition , there 'll always be a risk . You could come with us when we leave . Look after Linda and the baby . I can 't do that , John . I want you to . This is my home . Who told you Abby was trying to steal the baby ? I don 't know . But it wasn 't anyone you know , was it ? You heard a voice . When did you first hear God talking to you ? After the virus . He told me what to do . And you didn 't hear Him before ? I knew He was there . But there was always ... this fog , and I couldn 't hear Him in the fog . Did you take pills before the virus , John ? Or go to the doctor for an injection ? John ? Were you taking any medication ? I can 't remember . I can help you . We can find the pills you used to take . They told me I was ill , but they were making me ill ! Doctors , like you . Talking about me behind my back , planning things . They hated me . I don 't hate you . I want to help you . I don 't need your help ! You 're trying to trick me . You want to hide God from me again ! Is John sick ? I think so . I think he might be a schizophrenic . Do you know what that is ? His brain plays tricks on him . He has hallucinations and delusions . So he was making it up about talking to God ? He 's not lying . He believes everything he says is true . But it 's not , though , is it ? Can you help him ? Only if he wants me to . Come on , we said early . Come on , let 's go , let 's go , come on . Five minutes , yeah ? Come on , five minutes , yeah ? You 'll have to come with us . Linda needs you . OK . Anya ? Please , God , please , please , please ... John ? We don 't understand what 's happened - why we left so suddenly , why Anya is with us , and why you locked her in the vestry . She 's here to look after the baby . But she didn 't want to come . How do you know ? Did you talk to her ? Are you planning something ? No , of course not . It 's just ... we can all see she 's unhappy . Are you questioning me ? All of us are here because we want to be , because we love each other . It makes no sense to force anyone . What do you know about it ? God speaks to me , not you ! I know what 's right and no-one else ! Do you understand ? Do you understand ? ! Yes , John . Stop looking at me . All of you , stop looking at me ! And she said nothing to any of you ? They 've taken her . Maybe she wanted to go with them . Maybe she got religion . She 'd never leave without saying goodbye . They 're on foot . They can 't have got far . There are a million houses out there that they could hide in . - Are you gonna look in every one ? - If we have to , yes . Are you going ? Waste of time , isn 't it ? We 'll never find her . Do you think we should just give up ? You like her . Is there something going on between you ? I don 't like to be treated like an idiot . Don 't ask stupid questions , then . No , there 's nothing going on . We could be good together , Tom . I can make you happy . Do you want to hold him , John ? He 's a handsome little chap , isn 't he ? Shame his father isn 't here . What ? His real father - don 't you wish he was here ? No . I miss him , but that 's over now . Does the baby look like him ? A little , I suppose . You don 't have to worry , John . I never loved him like I love you . You know what you did wasn 't right , don 't you ? Locking her up like that . I did it for you and the baby . But she doesn 't want to be here . We could have gone anywhere , but we went to them . Don 't tell me that 's an accident . There 's a pattern in everything . He gave her to us . It 's what He wants ! I 'm sorry . I 've never seen him like this before . - He 's ill . You know that , don 't you ? - There 's a back door . Go quickly . You 've got to help him . You don 't understand . Please , no ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . It 's all right , darling . You didn 't mean to . Let me look at it . I 'm all right . I 'm all right . Anya ? Anya ! Anya ? Mike , no ! I don 't want to hurt you . Just tell us where she is . I won 't let you hurt us . John . You 're with them ! You 're against me , too . I 'm not against you , John . Please let her go . Easy , John . No ! Bring me the baby . Don 't do this , John . Bring him ! Listen , John . You 're not well . Let me help you . No , John ! Tom , no ! He 's sick . It 's all right , darling , it 's all right . I won 't let them hurt you . What are you going to do now ? We 'll find another way to live . We 'll be all right . Good luck ! He needs antipsychotics . See if he can remember what he used to take . If not , try him on Haldol , 30 milligrams a day . You can find it in the pharmacies . What will the drugs do to him ? Control his mood swings . Stop him from feeling paranoid . Will he still hear his voices ? I can 't take God away from him . Linda , he has to take his medication . He found me and took care of me . He gave me new hope . It 's my turn to take care of him now . He 's a paranoid schizophrenic . One day , he can hurt himself . Or one of you . My heart might stop beating tomorrow , or it might give me another 50 years . Well , none of us know for sure what 's gonna happen next . And he has the baby to think about now . You 'd be amazed at what love can do . Are you all right ? Fine . Hey . Hi . ... Fiona Murray . Um ... we 're trying to get to the Western Isles , if we can . Er , I 'm William Arnott and I 'm 54 years old . I 'm going north to find my daughter , Sadie . My name 's Abby Grant . I 'm looking for my son , Peter . And a man called Phil Emerson , who was with him . I got the virus . I wasn 't immune . I nearly died . But I recovered . I don 't know why . I was just , um ... lucky . He 's gone . Doesn 't he know what the city 's gonna be like now ? I will not allow murder to go unpunished . Don 't you dare bring my son into this . We make our own law now . The restoration of full government . Bringing you here was the first useful thing Darren has done in weeks . Drop it ! That 's it . We 've got nothing left . We 've got no food , no water . Tom ! No ! . : Napisy24 - Nowy Wymiar Napisów : . Napisy24.pl

 Previously on Heroes ... When I get back , we 'll be together . You came here to get control of your life . It 's another strain of the virus . My blood 's no longer a cure . I 'm going to die ? Claire is the key that could cure the virus . And he has asked you to give us Claire . You touch my daughter and I 'll kill yours . Then I 'll kill you . - Please don 't let them take me . - I 'll get us home , I promise - No , no ! Peter . I remember everything . See , when I get my ability back , I 'm gonna kill you and your sister . And I 'm gonna take it all . Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! No need to shout . Adam , I was there . I saw her . You haven 't gone anywhere , Peter . You were telling me about time travel And how you were going to save some girl from some deadly virus , And then you began shouting her name . No , no , I was in New York city a year from now . I saw Caitlin . I was calling at her to come back with me . Look . Impressive I have to keep trying . I can 't just leave her there to killed by the virus . What do you know about this virus ? I know that it kills over 93 % of the world 's population . Peter , do you know what the virus is called ? Shanti virus . That 's what the guy at homeland security called it . Does that mean something to you ? I knew a woman at the company . Victoria Pratt . She was a Biological Engineer . On Valentine 's day 1977 , She recovered a deadly virus from a sick Indian girl named Shanti . Under company orders , she tried to manipulate the virus into a weapon . I 'd heard the program had been shut down . Clearly I was misinformed . Those are my parents . Linderman , Charles Deveaux . What - Those are The Company founders , Peter . The virus is their crime . They 're responsible for this . Parents sin , children suffer . That is Victoria . We need to find her , Adam . We need to find her . Make her tell us everything that she knows . That 's the only way to stop the virus and save Caitlin . It 's the only way we can save the world . Get the hell out of my house . Noah Bennet was a loyal employee of our company , And for many years a true friend . I offer my deepest condolences . Are those my dad 's ashes ? You had my husband cremated ? Yes , his personnel file was very clear as to how his remains should be handled . What gives you the right ? We were only trying to help Claire use her abilities for the greater good . But Noah 's aggression forced our hand . He was trying to protect me . In the wake of this tragedy , I feel it 's only fair to honor Noah 's wishes . You will be left alone to lead a normal life . My father is dead . There is no normal . I 'm sorry for your loss . Pack your bags . We 're leaving tonight . The next 24 hours are critical . I want you to keep an eye on Claire . It 'd be easier without this thing on my arm . It itches like a mother ! And I thought my little girl was tough . I am , dad , but I was shot . And my body doesn 't heal itself . I 'm sorry you 're in pain , But none of this would 've happened if you hadn 't lowered your guard . How was I supposed to know that Bennet teamed up with West , the flying boy ? Excuses don 't change outcome , Elle . You need to accept responsibility for what 's happened . Can you do that ? Can you regain my trust ? Sure , daddy . I 'll watch the cheerleader . Subtitle Added By MohammaD [ shock ] Season 2 , Episode 10 [ Truth And Consequences ] Mohinder . Take it easy . Last thing I remember ... You were ... Ohh ... did you shoot me ? I didn 't have a choice . Why am I not dead ? You would have been , if you not for an infusion of your daughter 's blood . You took Claire 's blood ? It saved your life . You betrayed me . You went after my family ! You told me this company had to be brought down from the inside out . Thank god I came to my senses before I 'd done any real damage . What have you done with Claire ? Claire 's at home , grieving the loss of her father . They think I 'm dead . You put us on this path . With your violence , your paranoia . You have nobody to blame but yourself . What are you doing with that ? Your recovery has proven this blood has tremendous regenerative properties . I believe it holds the key to saving an innocent woman from a deadly virus . That 's what this company does . We save lives . Everything they 've told you is a lie . The company made that virus . They 've been experimenting with it for 30 years . You can 't trust them , Suresh ! You get back here , you son of a bitch ! 600 bucks for a comic book ? In mint condition . But that 's not why I collect them . I just like the stories . How about this for a story ? Once upon a time , we cash these in and live happily ever after , the end . Hey , if St. Joan 's a good guy , why is she wearing a hood ? Well , every superhero has to have a secret identity . How else could they live a normal life ? Who wants normal ? Pssh , I 'd be rolling large . Let everybody know who I was . But if your enemies knew who you really were , Then they 'd be coming after you at home , Maybe even taking revenge on your family . That 's why Clark Kent wears those glasses . Right . Micah ? Mom , you came back ! I told you that I would . I missed you every day . Oh , I missed you every minute , every second . What 's that even smaller one ? A nanosecond . I missed you that one too . So where were you , mom ? I went to a place that helps people like us when we 're sick . Is it Jessica again ? No , Jessica 's gone . They all are . This is about something else . What is it ? I have a virus . You don 't have to worry . I can 't make you or anybody else sick . What 's gonna happen to you ? Do you remember Dr. Suresh ? He is working really hard to find me a cure . And when he does , I 'll get better . Yeah , but what if he doesn 't ? He will . I am going to get better , Micah . We are going to have normal life . I promise you . I 've got something to make you stronger . Oh , yeah ? What 's that ? Dad 's medal . The one that the mayor gave him for saving that girl from the fire . It 's in my backpack . We cannot waste another nanosecond . What 's wrong , bud ? It 's my backpack . It 's gone . It 's beautiful here , Gabriel . Thank you . I almost feel normal . After you see Dr. Suresh , you will be . And then Alejandro and I can go back home . What if Alejandro could go home now ? But I need my brother . He 's the only one who can stop me from hurting anyone else . What if you could learn ... to control your own power ? I 've seen people 's powers grow . Do you love your brother enough to let him go ? Of course . It 's ... it 's just not possible . Well , you 'll never know ... unless you try . We should get back . - You put him through enough , Maya . - Me ? He gave up his entire life for you even after you killed his wife . It was an accident . You really think he 's forgiven you ? She was cheating on him . So she deserved to die ? That 's not what I meant . It 's just - But you wanted to kill her , didn 't you , Maya ? Stop it . Let me go . Where ? Back to your brother ? He hates you . Don 't do this . Please ! If you can control your power , no more innocent people have to die . I can 't ! Help . You 're killing me . Help ... please . You were right . I did it . I don 't think we should go in there guns blazing . Let 's just tell Victoria the truth . Ask her straight out where to find the virus . This woman can 't be trusted , Peter . She worked for the company . She locked me up . One glance at me on her garden path is liable to affect her mood . Fine . I 'll go alone . No . You lost ? Hope not . I 'm looking for Victoria Pratt . Never heard of her . You worked for the company . In 24 hours , the Shanti virus is released . A year from now , 93 % of the world 's population is dead . How can anyone know what happens a year from now ? I 've been there . I 've seen it . A time traveler . You created a virus that kills billons of people . I don 't know how it gets out or where , only that it does . Unless you help me . Inside ... Now . Hiro Hiro Containment breach in Bio-Research . Evacuation protocol in full effect . You have betrayed everything we stand for . No , Kaito , I tried to save the world . By releasing a virus that could kill billons of innocent people ? When you 're been around as long as I have , the patterns become clear . Constant war . Disregard for the environment . Famine . And it 's only getting worse . Someone had to make the hard choice for the greater good . Take him down to lockup . And throw away the key ! Are you all right , Victoria ? He was looking for strain 138 . If he 'd been successful , this place would 've been ground zero for a global pandemic . Thank you for saving us . You need to shut down the program , Kaito . Give it to me . This will be taken to the Primatech facility in Odessa . With Adam locked away , it will be safe . Look , with something that dangerous , there is no safe . That virus needs to be destroyed . The other founders would never allow that . Doesn 't that concern you ? Adam had help , Kaito . It 's the only way he would have known what to look for . I suggest you take a few days off before resuming your work . I won 't be a part of this . Not anymore . After Kaito and the others were killed , I figured that sooner or later someone would come after me . You look like your mother . I don 't know anything about this . The last time I saw my mother was a year from now , In a future where the world had already been devastated by the Shanti virus . Forgive my paranoia , but I don 't know you . I only knew your parents and what they were capable of . There was a woman . Caitlin . She trusted me to protect her . Now ... Somehow I took us into the future , and now I can 't get back . So if you just tell me where to find the virus , I know that I can save her . You 're looking for a mutated strain , 138 . If it were ever released , It would kill us all . She tell you where to find the virus ? Company storage facility in New Mexico . New Mexico ? Company never had a facility - Wait , you don 't understand . No , you 're working with him now . That 's all I need to know . I knew blowing your head off was the only way to be sure . Better late than never . Thanks , Peter . Let 's get her up to the house . Alejandro ! Maya ? Did you tell your brother the good news ? Is something wrong ? This ... says you murdered your mother . But I know you didn 't . You couldn 't . It 's true . I did it . I killed her . When my mother found out what I could do , she didn 't understand . She told me I was a monster . My own mother tried to kill me , Maya . And as I defended myself , There was an accident . I understand . Alejandro , no ! Everything 's gonna be okay , Maya . I 'll take care of you . Why did you lie to me , Victoria ? You 're with him . You 're helping Adam release the virus . Release the virus ? I 'm trying to find the virus so I can destroy it . 30 years ago , Adam broke into my lab . I stopped him from releasing the virus so he couldn 't kill everyone . And now he 's trying to do it again . I broke into the lab to prevent you and company from putting the world in danger . You killed Kaito , didn 't you ? And the others . And now it 's my turn . We 're trying save lives , Victoria , not take them . Adam 's a killer . And I guess since you 're helping him , you 're one too . Just like your parents . Adam helped me escape the company . He saved my brother 's life . But what you did , What you were a part of , That will bring an end to the world . Tell me where I can find the virus so I can stop it . Go to hell . Where is it , Victoria ? Primatech paper , Odessa , Texas . Texas . No ! Thank you . I am not gonna let you do this ! Get away from me ! We 're not hurting you . We 're letting you go . What are you doing ? Wait ! You didn 't have to kill her . She was about to take your head off . There 's no coming back from that one . I 'm gonna get the car . If anyone survives , I 'll tell them ... I couldn 't have done it without you . Well ? There was this kid on 3rd street who said he can tell me how much your comics were worth . I figured if you knew how much we 'd get then maybe - Where are they ? Where 's my backpack ? It was a setup . I got jacked - Oh ! Micah ! Damon ! - My dad 's medal was in that bag ! - I 'm sorry ! I 'll get you a new one ! You gonna get me a new dad , too ? - I 'm sorry . - I don 't care ! I hate you ! We 're gonna get you all cleaned up . And then I 'm gonna call the police , And you 're gonna tell them everything that happened . Come on . We need to get it back . Nana 's calling the police . I 'm not talking about the police . I 'm talking about us . We could get it back . We have talked about this . We need to be heroes . Like dad . Being a hero is what got your father killed . The medal 's gone . I 'm sorry . You all packed , Maya ? I tried to let you go the easy way . But you had to be persistent . I 'm taking my sister . Gabriel . Gabriel ! Hey . I didn 't hear you with the water running . Is everything okay ? - I have to talk to you . - Yeah ? You were right . About everything . About me . About Alejandro . I never meant to come between you two . He 's my brother . I have to do what I can to protect him . In time , he will understand . Of course he will . And without you , I would still be somewhere in Mexico . I just want to help you . You have done that . And so much more . Your mom said you 're leaving tonight . I 've fallen 20 stories . Been stabbed in the head . Crashed a car at 70 miles an hour . I 've even been on fire . But this hurts ... more than any of that . And it 's not getting better . I 've always gotten better no matter what , but this just keeps getting worse . I can 't stand to see you hurt like this . I won 't be . Not for long . There 's a man who used to work with my dad . He has the ability to erase people 's memories . These are a signal so that he knows to come . He can make forget I ever had a father . Are you gonna hang those in the window ? How do you know he 's gonna see them ? I don 't know , but I have to do something . You don 't want to forget your dad . Forgetting isn 't the answer . I just wish I could tell him how sorry I am . Micah . Why are you dressed like that ? I know what it 's like to lose someone you love . To wish that you had a piece of them , something solid to hold onto . Anybody tried to steal my mom 's piano , I 'd feed ' em their teeth . Look . I know where those kids live . The ones who stole your backpack . You 're gonna help me get back my dad 's medal ? Long as you stay out of the way . Anything crazy happens , I need you safe . Okay , I promise . Shh , we still gotta sneak you out . Come on . It 's as we 'd hoped . Claire 's blood has fortified my antibodies . They 're strong enough to defeat the mutated virus now . Congratulations , doctor . You promised Niki Sanders you 'd find a cure , and you have . And you promised me this Company 's viral research would end . In working up this cure , I 've been pouring over records That reveal the full extent of your program . And you of all people should understand what it would mean to Find a safe way to remove the abilities of dangerous individuals . Here , strain 138 . If even the smallest amount were released , it would wipe out all of human civilization . This strain is locked safely away in our facility in Texas . And I can assure you , doctor , this company is vigilant about security . Really ? For weeks I operated as a spy within your ranks undetected . God knows what someone with experience and ill intent could achieve . What can I do for you ? Help me hunt down every strain of virus within this company and destroy them . - Hello . - Niki ? It 's Mohinder Suresh . Are you still in New Orleans ? Yes . I think I found the cure , Niki . I 'll bring to you on the next flight . You 're nightmare 's over . I don 't know what to say , doctor . Thank you . Micah . There 's no one home . You should have plenty of time . You know how to get up there yet ? Almost . Got it . I just wish it wasn 't so bright . I don 't want people thinking I 'm robbing the place . Okay . How did you do that ? I told the lights I need them to be off for a while . - You told ' em . - Yeah . What ? You 're St. Joan ! You really have to stop reading those comic books . Stay here . I 'll be right back . Y 'all put that gas in that van . You figured out why they 're paying us so much to torch all these buildings ? Who cares ? As long as he comes with that cash , we come with the matches . I 'm sorry , dad . I 'm sorry I didn 't listen . I should 've done everything you told me to . If I hadn 't been so selfish , you 'd still be here . I love you , dad . We gotta better say good-Bye . We gotta be in Salt Lake by morning . Come on . This is all happening so fast . I 'm losing everything I care about . Claire ! What the hell are you doing here ? I came to watch the sunset . Liar ! Watch who you 're shoving , pompom . Claire , don 't . This isn 't fair . Welcome to life . Come on Claire , we gotta go . No mum , we don 't . I can tell the world what they did , how they kidnapped me and murdered my father . You have no prove , no one would believe you . You 're probably right . I guess I just have to show . I 'll show everyone what exactly what i can do . Once the secret out , you won 't be able to touch me or my family . You 'll be the ones running . - Hello . - Hello , Mohinder . Sylar ? Where are you ? I convinced the babysitter to take the night off . Don 't worry . I 'm taking good care of the little one . If you touch Molly - We won 't want to wake her . I brought someone to see you . She needs your help . We both do . See you soon , Mohinder . This doesn 't look like the sort of place where they 'd store a virus that could destroy the world . Paper company 's just a front . The good stuff is 3 floors down . Laboratories , jail cells - - Hiro ? - Peter Petrelli ? What are you doing here ? Adam Monroe killed my father , and for that he must pay . I can 't let you do that . Then you have chosen the wrong side . No ! I can 't let you hurt him . Brought To You By MohammaD [ shock Movies ] To Be Continued ...

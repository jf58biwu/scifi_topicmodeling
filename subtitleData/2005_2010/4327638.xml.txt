 Better get your game face on ... 'cause that 's the Venture Compound over there . Yeah , we lost a lot of good men trying to take that hill . 21 , why are you wasting your breath on the new meat ? ! Nine out of ten don 't even last a month ! Attention , my coiled minions ! Battle speech . Smoke ' em if you got ' em . Coil , my bright and bewinged army ! Coil and prepare to strike like the deadly sky-flowers you are ! - This is making me feel a little gay . - You , sir , are a big gay . ... awaits the enemies of the Mon ... What ? ! OK , so I 'm getting the wrap-it-up signal . Me , The Monarch . Yes , all right ! Fine ! Release the cloud of deception / diversion ! - Here we go ! - On your feet , Texas ! - Go , go , go ! - Fly , my spangly vengeance ! Fly to victory ! Brock Samson ! More power ! I must have more power ! Look , Brock . His fingers ! They 're twitching . Yeah , well , a stiff will do that if you shove a gigavolt up its ass . No , he 's alive ! Alive I tell you . Sure , Doc . Holy ... Told ya . This is it , Brock , The big one . The holy grail of super-science ! Brock , / cliché ! Well , great . Just great . Now you broke his whole head . Hey , there , bright eyes . Feeling better ? So , no hard feelings . I 'll chalk your little strangle-tantrum up to the surprise resurrection ... and the adrenaline enema and your basic criminal nature . Hey , pop , why is the top of that guy 's head black ? Not black , Hank , African American . The top of that guy 's head is African American . Dad , why is the top of this guy 's head African American ? Because Brock caved in his original cranium , and I had to use whatever fit . So , Brock killed him ? And you brought him back to life ? That 's right , boys . Your father 's beating death at her own game . Father ! No ! No , no , no . - Father . - Oh , no . Don 't think of me as your father . Please ! I get enough of that noise from these two . Darn ! Out of gas . Hey , gang , dig this ! Looks like some sort of secret abandoned military base . Patriarchal white pig square 's nest . Far out , Val . But something 's fishy in the state of Denmark . I can feel a mystery coming on . Ted , you said I could see my parents . This was on the way , Patty . We 've been driving to my parents ' house for ten years . - You promised . - Patty ... being out of your box isn 't a right , it 's a privilege . Baby , you don 't want to go back in your box , do you ? No . Sonny , Groovy , wake up ! Mystery time . Please , Groov , just say something to them . Say a " hi " or anything ... just so they 'll believe me . I 'm not here to talk to them . You are the hand chosen by the master . No ! Yours is the Wheel of Blood . Yours is the sword of Michael . Hey , Sonny ? Shut up ! Shut up ... damn it ! I can 't hear myself think . Come on , Sonny . Mystery . ... your mystery , man . I 'm sick . Sonny ? Bet you 'll come out for some Groovy treats . Why do we have to eat breakfast with your dead guy ? Venturestein has been through a lot , Dean . - Venturestein ! - You like that ? - Sure do , pop . - Good boy , Hank . Dean ? Right now , Hank is better than you . Anywho , the next phase of my work will be to socialize Venturestein ... to help him make the transition from dead guy to contributing member of society . Who says dead people can 't carry their own weight ? And maybe some of your stuff while they 're at it . Dude ! Fly walking on your eye ! I don 't know about this , Ted . Patty , if God didn 't want us to solve this mystery ... he wouldn 't have had us run out of gas here . But what 's the mystery ? You know ? We 're not out of gas , man . We got a five-gallon can in the back of the ... Damn it ! Why do you hate God so much ? I don 't hate God , man . Well , God thinks you hate Him . And that 's just as bad as hating Him . So , how about you and Groovy go start looking for some clues . Clues to what ? What is your trip ? Clues to why I don 't chain you to the back of my van ... and road-haul you till you 're nothing but a pelvis wearing a belt . Guy is pissing on your lawn , man . What ? What are you looking at ? - Why does he gotta cry like that ? - I think you scare him . I 'm not the one who froze his corpse ... or nuked him back from the great beyond ... to be a half-dead short-bus seat-warmer . But you did kill him . And then when I unkilled him , you kind of did it again . You hit him so hard he 's got an afro now . Yeah ! You 're like fire to his Frankenstein . - Venturestein . - Right ! And Venturestein is all like ... " Brock bad ! " Mr. Venture , I caught you . - Yay . - As per our landlord-tenant agreement ... I come to inform you of a small gathering I will host ... from say 5 : 00 in the post-meridian until question mark . Whatever . Knock yourself out . Any and all who hunger to know the secrets of self ... which stud like internal suns in the inky lattice-work of our very minds ... may join us in our purgative journey of ... Is that man dead ? No . Once again , Mr. Venture you cut decency to the quick ... and leave her to die in prostitute alley ! Prostitoo ! Prostitute . - Prostitoo ! - Prostitute . Brock , you 're a man of no small character . - What say you on this ? - Not really my department . But we two souls have shared a cheese sandwich more than twice ... and the stitched together quilt of your stony silences ... forms a tapestry of quiet desperation . No , it doesn 't . You are truly a Grim Reaper , my friend . But when you need to talk , I will be there . All right then . Brock bad . Good ! Suffixed consonants ! Good ! Brock bad ! And that 's the problem with men , Patty . The Y-gene is just an incomplete X-chromosome , dig ? A man is an incomplete female . Just a walking abortion . Gosh ! I hope Ted lets me take a shower soon . Zip it , gang . Something 's going down . Oh , my God ! Who is Héctor Molina ... and why do they keep sending me his junk mail ? Heads up , kids . Think we may have stumbled onto a Dracula factory . Where the heck did they put African America ? I don 't know , Hank ... but it 's not on any of my charts . I know . To the learning beds ! Dude , I am not getting in that thing with stinky old Venturestein . What 's he doing in there anyway ? Dad said he needs to socialize him ? Stand by for Part 7-B of Volume One . Take this time to reflect ... Who 's down in the old manufacturing wing ? I 'll get the flashlight ! I 'll get the astronaut ice cream ! Hi ! I 'm Everyday Joe ! I speak for you because ... Well , heck , I am you ! And sometimes I catch both of us wondering ... " Hey , what 's good about child labor ? " Yes , General Manhowers . My Venturesteins could be easily adapted to ground warfare . I suppose their chest cavities could hold quite a lot of C4 , certainly . That many ? No , of course ! No , that 's wonderful , General . Wonderful ! Good . Everything 's going my way , finally . Cross that off the old to do list . Come on ! Come on . Look , grandpa ! I made a shoe all by myself ! Little Jorge knows the satisfaction of a job well done ... and so can you ! Just watch and listen carefully ... and soon you 'll be ready for a career in bonded servitude ! - See you in a jiffy ! - / Vivan los zapatos ! Prostitoo ! Prostitoo ! Brock ! Think I might be a tapestry of quiet desperation . Excellent ! Everyone ! The sacred death vine ceremony is about to begin . Allow me to introduce our guide ... Don Rio impossible Isabanco ... one of the Amazon 's most learned shaman . I can feel it , friends ! Tonight will be a night of great healing and human oneness . I 'm not sure this is my scene . Correction ! Dracula-Frankenstein factory ! The few remaining men will exist as studs ... breeding in the cow pasture . Or they could go off to the nearest suicide center ... where they 'll be quietly gassed to death . Come on , guys ! Val , don 't . Pray tell , Brock Samson , you old so and so . What burden does your soul carry to our sacred circle ? I don 't know . Just not on my game today . Something 's not ... right . You are a child of the past . We must be children of the future . - Hang on a sec . What ? - Brock . I need dead people . Lots and lots of dead people . I 've got twelve with the henchmen you killed ... not counting the black guy with half a head . But we need like 100-something . We need like a full gross of dead people . Right , and ... where are we gonna get all these dead people ? Well , I thought seeing as how you 're ... you know , you and all ... I thought ... maybe ... you could go out and ... - No . - Make some ... - No . ... dead people . - No . - Well , fine ! - Thanks a lot for not helping ! - Anything else ? Help me get dead people ! Soup 's on , everyone ! Painted lips . Schoolgirl outfits . And the pretty hair , Sonny . The hair needs to be punished , Sonny ! Would ya give it a rest , Groov ? Start doing the master 's bidding ! You 're already filthy with wrath and sin ! - Halt ! - Who goes there ? ! ... God , wow ! - A hippie ! - We better follow him ! - And how ! - What is this ? - Liquid extract of the death vine . Your portal to another world of consciousness . This some kind of Jonestown deal ? Let not the Dixie cup mislead you ! The death vine will allow you to shed your ego . Only then ... can the repair of your spiritual whole commence . What the hell . Sonny , Groovy ! - There you are ! - Ted ! I 'm losing it , man ! No Groovy treat until you find a clue , dirtbag . I just saw those kids ! What kids , Sonny ? The squares from back in Baja when I was all freaked ! Don 't you remember ? ! Like , two years ago ! Me and Groovy had just run into something . Groov said it was a monitor lizard , but I wasn 't so sure . And then , all of a sudden ... Sonny ! What happened ? ! They freaked me , man . What ? You think I need this kind of heat ? ! Do you ? ! - I 'm sorry ! - Do you ? ! Sonny , I swear to the Lord God , my savior ... I will kill the living ... out of that dog ! Shut that dog up ! No . No , no . It 's OK , Groovy . - I got to learn ... - Yeah . That 's right . Learn what ? Got to learn to respect ... and not to harsh Ted 's mellow . Boys ? ! Boys ? ! Brock got the X-1 started . Let 's go ! Don 't make me come down there , boys ! These are my dress-up shoes . Don 't you see , Ted ? They have to be ghosts ... 'cause I killed them ! Yeah . He was just this guy . A guy in a butterfly suit who got in over his head . And I could see it in his eyes ... that if I let him get away this one time ... he 'd never come back . But ... then I also thought , you know ... kill him . What kind of way is that to ... One time ... I 'm on the Amazon in my canoe ... and I see swim the dolphin ... the beautiful dolphin ... so , I slip out of my canoe ... and I grab her ... this fish ... and then I ... it , this fish ! Hell 's that got to do with anything ? ! Hot dolphin ! You 're an idiot ! Don Rio is a transcendent multidimensional genius , Brock . His every word an onion of infinite leaf ... his every pearl ... Yes . This is coming on ... 30,000 feet . Cruising altitude . Oh , God ! Feel like I got a stomach full of drunk bees . Brock Samson ... this is your chance to find the way of peace ... of positive rainbow energization ... and karmic repair . Dried up little Keebler ! You poisoned me ! Venturestein ? ! Change of curriculum . You 're going to military school ! Problemo . You know what ? I think I ... I feel a little bad about killing that guy . Yes , my friend . A splendid first step ind ... All right ! Yeah ! Just cool out , Sonny . Look . Val found some tools and crap that I think we can sell . For money ? - What are you doing ? ! - Yeah ! That 's our dad 's stuff ! Get off our property ! Sonny ! You were right ! And this dog ... talks , man ! Think these guys have a screw loose , Hanker . Copy that . No , no ! Sonny killed you . I 'm telling you . Like , they 're ghosts , man ! Only one way to find out . Super run-away ! You see , Brock Samson , we 're all one . We all share the same need ... for shelter , warmth , fulfillment . The secret of happiness , lies not in conquest ... but in empathy . Better dolphin ! - Samson ! - Hunter ? ! What is all this nambi-pambi feel bad about good wet-work moose crap ? ! You 're beyond good and evil , Superman ! - You work for the Government . - What about ... humanity and empathy and all that garbage ? Who cares ?

I 'm so cold , man . I 'm so ... cold . Oh , no . Well , Venturestein ... I 'd say that radioactive isotope I put in your spine ... is worth its weight in radioactivity . - Doc ! - What 's going on here ? ! It 's bad , Doc , real bad . The boys saw their own clones . I think they 're in some kind of ... saw-your-own-clone coma . Boys ! Get up ! - Yes , sir ! - I hope you 're proud of yourselves . You 've ... - You 've ruined the surprise . - The what ? ! This was going to be your Christmas present . A whole big army of yous ... ready to think you 're the coolest , and do your chores ... maybe eliminate targets in high-risk combat zones .

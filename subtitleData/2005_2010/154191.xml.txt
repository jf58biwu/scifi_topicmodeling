 Previously on Surface ... Terrance ! Terrance ! Oh , my God ! ( announcer ) The species turned hostile . Hopin ' you can identify the animal that did this . An electrician got bitten yesterday in the marsh by some critter . ( announcer ) Was Nimrod the killer ? Really ? ( announcer ) Miles rushed to find out . Look . That 's him . You 're not Nim . Miles ! Get out of there , man ! Oh , my God ! Are you okay ? Don 't tell Mom . I 'm fine . Nim did that . No , i-it wasn 't Nim . ( announcer ) Rich and Daughtery built a submersible to get proof of the species . They 're breeding . ( announcer ) But on the surface , something went terribly wrong . Oh , my God . ( Daughtery ) Jackson , do you copy ? We are falling way too fast ! You have to pull us back up ! You 've got to stop us ! ( Rich ) Hang on to something ! ( announcer ) They were stranded on the sea floor ... until a miraculous recovery . We 're going up ! ( announcer ) Now Surface continues ... You gotta get out ! Go , go , go , go , go . Do you see Jackson ? Do you see him ? No ! Do you ? This isn 't far from the launch site ! Emergency beacon ! Emergency beacon ! That 'll help . Come on ! All right . Damn it ! The contacts are corroded ! So what , it 's not gonna work ? No , I don 't think so . It 's 121.5 megahertz . That 's like , at least , ten years old . It 's okay , it 's okay . Jackson will come . Jackson will come . And if he doesn 't , it 's okay . It 's not like he 's the only one that knew we were out here . Only Shaw . He 's the only one I told . But that 's good . He 's a smart guy . Shaw 's a smart guy . He 'll figure it out . Yeah , but it 'll take four days for him to even think that we 're overdue . And then another two days for rescue operations to start . So , six days . You hear that ? You hear that ? You hear that , Rich ? Look ! Look ! Flare ! Get the flare ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Do they see us ? They see us . Hey ! He 's gotta see it . He 's gonna see it . Oh , yeah ! Hey ! ( Rich ) He doesn 't see it ! He doesn 't see it ! Oh , no ! Oh , we got a leak . What ? We got a- - We got a leak . There should be a repair kit in here . Okay , okay ! Okay ? Something must have popped off that flare and burnt through the hull . Okay . Okay , okay . Oh , God ! Oh , no ! What ? This stupid thing 's got dry rot ! What ? ! Ah , son of a gun . Oh , here 's another . Oh , no ! You son of a bitch ! No , don 't go back in that water , Rich ! This is the Northern Pacific in mid-November- - The boat is sinking . Rich , I 'm telling you ... You 're gonna get hypothermia ! Rich , you 've gotta come back ! Please ! Rich , get back in the boat ! Get back here ! Are you okay ? Yeah . Did you get it ? No . Why not ! I don 't know . It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's all right . Miles , are you up ? Seven minute warning if you want a ride . Better not be in bed . Oh , great ! Look , I know you 've been pulling all-nighters looking for Nim , Nod , or whatever ... His name is Nimrod . So when did he come back ? Uh , last night . You planning on telling mom and dad ? When the time 's right . My opinion , that 's not today . ( Sylvia ) Savannah ! I mean , let 's not give them an excuse to stay , you know ? ( Sylvia ) Hey , is your brother up yet ? Yeah . He even dressed himself . Come on , we 'll miss our plane . Okay , you 're the adult while we 're gone , understand ? Yes , of course . Okay , you and Miles have a second chance to prove you can be on your own here , okay ? Let 's not blow it . We won 't , Dad . Good . We wouldn 't be taking off if , you know , we had a choice , but you know how it is . Really , please , you guys . Just go have fun . At a law firm retreat ? Look , the hotel doesn 't have phones , it 's that swanky . So , if you need to reach us , use our cell phones . What 's wrong with your leg ? Nothing , it just fell asleep . Well , you should put it to bed earlier . Come on , I don 't want to have to explain why we 're the only ones to miss the flight . So everybody okay ? Yes , mom . ( Sylvia ) Bye . All right . Don 't be late for school . ( Savannah ) We love you . Bye . So , your leg 's hurt , isn 't it ? Where those things bit you . I 'm fine . Really . Then why are you walking like you 're 80 years old ? I 'm practicing for when I am . You know he can 't stay , right ? Sip . Hmm ? No , I 'm okay . Don 't be ridiculous , Rich . Where the hell is Jackson ? I don 't know . What 's he gonna do ? That tether broke . He had to assume we 're dead . He would never assume that . Why not ? Because his ego 's too big to think that he couldn 't save us . Oh , pfff . What , you don 't- - you don 't think that he 's gonna come ? I don 't know why he would if he thought we were dead . I wouldn 't be surprised if he went on and called up your ex , and told him we didn 't make it . Gonna be nobody mounting any kind of rescue operation . ( Daughtery ) Don 't talk like that . Like what ? Like my life 's in the past tense . If it wasn 't for you , I 'd be at home picking up Jesse- - Oh , come on , don 't blame this all on me . Why not ? You 're the one that brought us down to the bottom- - You knew exactly what you were getting yourself into ! Yeah , I did , and I 'm gonna get myself out of it- - So quit being such a baby , and take some responsibility ! You know , I have kids too ! All right ? I got a wife ! I know ! You 're not the only one losing something here ! Dude , you 're gimping . What did I tell you ? Does it hurt ? Um , maybe a little . Looks like more than little . It 's from getting bit , isn 't it ? I don 't know . What else can it be ? What if that thing had rabies ? What if ? You have to get shots in your stomach with a 10-inch needle . It 's not rabies . I don 't know . You look kind of sweaty . I don 't have rabies , Phil . Stop saying that . Something 's definitely wrong , homes . Dude , that 's infected . You got to put something on that . And he won 't stop following me . Nim won 't . Something must 've happened when he was gone . Maybe he imprinted . Like a duck . No , no , it 's way beyond that . He wants to sleep with me . He follows me in the shower . Dude , we 're in a locker room . Make it clear we 're talking about a lizard . Whoa , dude , that 's so disgusting . Doesn 't it hurt , bro ? Yeah . But it 's okay . Dr. Phil on the case . This will kill the germs . You ready ? One ... two ... three . ( Rich ) We did the right thing . I don 't know . I guess . We did . And hey , we got what we came for , right ? Video ... , the species ... That definitely counts for something . If we live . Yeah , that 's the catch , ain 't it ? Ah , that damn fine print . [ whispers ] Rich . Hmm ? Rich . Hmm ? Shark . Hmm ? Shark ! Where ? White shark . 20-footer . ( Rich ) He 's circling . That 's just ' cause he 's- - He 's just checking us out . No , it 's circling because it 's gonna strike in about 20 minutes . Huh ? We gotta scream . We gotta scream as loud as we can . You scream , I 'm gonna shoot the son of a bitch . No , that 's the last flare we have . Who cares if it 's our last flare , if it 's a shark gonna eat us ! Listen to me , it 's your turn to have faith in me . Look at me . Seriously , put it down . Put it down . We can scream and scare it away , okay ? Okay , okay , okay . All right , all right . What do we do ? Scream . You ready ? Mesopotamia . The cradle of civilization . What does that mean ? What happened there 5,000 years ago that changed the world , practically overnight ? Some sudden breakthrough in human intelligence ? Absolutely not . It was an animal . But what animal was it ? Dude , wake up . ( teacher ) What allowed for the cultivation of vast acreage ? Miles . Creating food surpluses for the first time in history . Miles . Are you with us ? Guess an animal , dude . Any animal . Lizard . Try an ox . Miles , stand up . ( teacher ) What 's that on your leg ? I don 't know . Come up here so I can get a look at it . Now . Um , I 'm fine . Really . ( Miles ) It 's ... it 's nothing . ( teacher ) Miles , get up here now . I want you to go to the infirmary . So , when 's the party ? What party ? There is no party . With your parents out of town ? Are you kidding me ? You know , my house is not a frat for you and your Neanderthal friends every time my parents go out of town . Yes , it is . Oh , Savannah , they want you in the office . Something about your brother . Shocker . Miles ? Miles ? Savannah , thank God . You look terrible . Are you okay ? He 's been trying to convince me that he is , but he 's not . I am okay . No , you 're not . Miles , sit down . Put the thermometer back in your mouth . I was beginning to worry that I wouldn 't get a family member at all . I tried six different numbers for your parents- - They 're out of town . Home alone . So your brother said . I 'm almost 18 , Mrs. Bowen . Fine , then you 're in charge . 103 . You are not going anywhere . Okay , so be the bigger sister and talk some sense into him . Tell him to lie down and take it easy . Let me see the flesh wound . Savannah , I- - Let me see it . I don 't think- - Don 't . Show me . All right . Here . ( Miles ) I really think it 's not that big of a deal . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . It got bigger . Would someone like to tell me what caused this ? Savannah ? She doesn 't know . Let me talk to my brother for a second . Thank you . Miles . I 'm okay . I cannot believe you did not tell mom and dad . You were the one who said don 't tell ' em . Yeah , that Nim came back . I didn 't know you had gangrene . Miles ? Promise you won 't tell anybody . Miles , stop it . Miles ? Stop it . Stop it ! Stop it ! Miles ! Miles ? Mrs. Bowen , come help ! Raymond ? Raymond call an ambulance . Miles ? Miles ! ( Daughtery ) You know , I think it 's gone . I think the shark 's gone . I think we scared it away , you know ? Well , that 's good . I just hope it was us that did it . Yeah . Hey , don 't splash around like that in the water . No , it 's okay . Hey . What do you want with that ? It 's a bunch of seaweed . No , it 's Chondrus crispus . It 's edible seaweed . You want some ? No . I 'm all right . Come on , it 's really not that bad . You should eat . I 'm good . I ain 't that hungry . Hey , I thought Cajuns would eat anything . I tell you , I think it 's gonna be another cold one tonight . 26 hours--26 hours , and still no Jackson . This ocean should be crawling with rescue vehicles . I think something happened to him . He 's tachypneic . His respiration 's at 44 and shallow . BP 's at 132 over 94 . What 's his name ? Miles Barnett . ( Savannah ) He 's my brother . Miles ? You wanna tell me how you 're feeling ? Miles . What 's his temperature ? We didn 't get a read . Our unit broke , but he 's burning up . When did this start ? A couple hours ago . In school . ( Savannah ) Please do something . ( male doctor ) He 's seizing . ( female doctor ) Let 's get a lumbar puncture . What 's the temperature ? 108 point 3 . ( female doctor ) Get him in there ! Go , go , go , go . Get set . One , two , three . What is he doing ? We 've gotta get his temperature down . ( Savannah ) Don 't hurt him . Please Miss , just stay back , We 're doing everything we- - Stop it ! ( Savannah ) Get out of my way ! N-Nim ! ( Miles ) Nim ! Help me ! ( Miles ) Help ! Help ! Hey , Miles . Miles , it 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm here . Somebody help me . No , it 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Shh . Dried blood . We got something here . Shell casings . About a dozen . Must 've been a hell of a fight . Hey . Hey . You 're having a nightmare . Mmm , it 's so cold . I know . It 's killing me . You know , there is something that we could be doing to keep us a little warmer . What ? What ? We could spoon . Uh , I think that under the circumstances , my wife would understand . Okay , yeah , that 's good , fine . Under the circumstances- - Okay . Hey , Laura . Yeah ? Look . You see ? Kind of makes you feel a little small , don 't it ? Yeah , it does . ( Rich ) What do you think they 're doing ? I don 't know . Communicating ? Some sort of migratory ritual , or something . I don 't know what the apocalypse is supposed to look like , but I imagine it looking something like that . Mom , dad . I 've been leaving messages everywhere I can think of . Um ... Miles is sick . Really sick . ( Savannah ) He 's in the hospital , and , um , you have to come home . I guess your cells are off or whatever , but , um ... I sure hope you get this . So , um , call . Okay , call . Any luck ? No . We 're moving your brother to ICU . What ? What 's wrong with him ? Well , that 's the problem . We don 't know exactly . The precise medical term is a fever of unknown origin . No , I told you the origin . That bite on his leg . The lesions on his leg have none of the indicators of an animal bite . There 's no tissue tearing . No punctures- - No , I told you . And no infection . His white counts are normal . His labs are clean . Whatever 's causing that fever , is not a normal inflammatory response . The only diagnostic issue we found is a severe electrolyte imbalance . I 'm gonna be real honest with you . I am at a loss here . With a fever that high ... What ? Your brother 's life is in danger . Is there anything you can think of to give us some context ? What if I showed you one like the thing that bit Miles ? Would that help ? I hate the rain . I hate it . Yeah . It 's strange , but ... it reminds me of my grandmother . Every time I visited her , it was always raining out . She was a horrible woman , and she was very vain and manipulative . I remember this one time , she- - she was watching over me and it was raining , and we went to the store right as it was closing . And all of the lights were being turned off . And we were rushing through the store . And all of a sudden she started just trashing my mother . Saying that my mother wasn 't worthy of my father . She was a horrible woman to say that to such a little kid . And I didn 't really understand at the time . Come on ! Get that bag ! It 's the camera ! I got it . Come on . Come on ! Nim ? Nim ? Nim ? Nim ? Nim ? Nimmy ? Nim ? Nim ? Nim ! Nim ! Come back ! Come back ! Nim ? Nim , come back ! Nim ? Who let you in ? I knocked . How 's Miles ? Not good . I gotta find Nimrod . I didn 't know you knew his name . Nimmy ? Nim ? Just so you know , Miles doesn 't really call him like that . Why don 't you tell me how , Phil , huh ? I don 't know . You gotta ask Miles . I thought you both were like- - No , that 's Miles . He has the ESP . I don 't think he needs to call him . Find him . Mom , Dad ? No , I 'm sorry , this is Paul Blum from over at the aquarium . ( Blum ) Is Miles there ? No . Well , he wasn 't at work today , I just wanted to check and see if everything 's okay . Miles is in the hospital . Why ? ( Savannah ) They don 't have any idea . Something bit him when he was in the water . Wait a minute . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . Are you telling me Miles was bitten ? [ cage slams shut ] Got him ! I gotta go . Ooh , what--what 's going on ? Just stay there . Just stay there . What are you doing ? I 'm just gonna redistribute the weight . No , no , don 't get off the raft . I 'm not getting off . I 'm just redistributing . Get some more over here to you . There you go . There you go . No . There you go . Laura . Look . Eggs . She was just protecting her eggs . Let 's get the hell out of here . No , stay here . They work as a shield . Huh ? They might keep us from getting killed . Take it easy . We 're right here . Mom ? No , honey , it 's not your mother . She 'll be here soon . Tell her- - Tell her that it wasn 't Nim 's fault . Wasn 't whose fault ? Nim . It wasn 't Nim 's fault . He--he 's not the one who bit me . Okay , okay , okay . He didn 't do it . I 'm gonna get you something so you can rest . Tell her ! Okay , okay , okay . Excuse me , could you please get Dr. Kellino for me ? She 's with a patient right now . Okay , well then , can you tell her that I have it ? I 'm sorry , who are you ? My name is Savannah Barnett . My brother is Miles . Savannah . I 'm Paul Blum . Mr. Blum . Please come with me quickly . I have one like the thing that bit Miles . Miles is keeping one of these things ? For weeks . He didn 't want anyo- - to know . We 're gonna die . Don 't say that . No . Hey , what are you doin ' ? What are you doin ' ? You see that light ? Look at that . You see that ? Look at that light ! It makes light . It 's visible . ( Dr. Kellino ) So this animal thing , whatever it is , that 's now loose in my hospital , is responsible for two attacks ? That 's great . Is there a reason why local E.R.s weren 't notified ? We were just beginning to investigate . So what 's the story with this other victim ? That guy from Southport . The attack was fatal . Get security . Tell them we 've got an animal loose in ICU . Stay back . Get a crash cart in here , he 's going flatline ! ( Savannah ) Miles ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Viz is really limited , I- - Wait , hold that , I got somethin ' . I got somethin ' , it 's- - We got a flare ! We got a flare . Not a vessel , it 's some kind of green light . Are you seein ' this ? It 's hard to tell what I 'm seeing . Please , do it . Please , do it . Hey ! Hey ! All right , Command , I 'm gonna take it down , get a closer look , over . He sees us ! He 's coming . He 's coming . He 's coming ! Look ! Look at him ! All right , I got ' em . Look . There 's two of ' em , at least , a guy and a girl . Call the radio . Get the rescue gear out . Roger that . Hey ! ( Rich ) Over here ! Hey ! It 's over . No ! No , wait ! What the hell was that ? I don 't know , but I am backing ' off . Backin ' off . Wait ! You can 't leave us ! Wait ! Clear ! 300 . So where is it ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? It--it went this way . Charged . Clear ! 360 . ( security guard ) That 's just terrific . No , no , no . No gun . I just want you to stand guard till I can get a tranq gun . Charged . Clear ! There it is . Now stay back . It 's dangerous . No gun . Please , I 'm asking you . Don 't . You 're worried about an animal . We got a building full of patients here now . Stand back . ( security guard ) Please . Where 's that epi ? We need those meds ! Where is he ? Where 's Nim ? Where is he ? No , no , Miles , Miles . It 's okay . It 's okay . Where is he ? Somebody help , please ! ( doctor ) Let 's get a wheelchair . Where is he ? No , no . It 's okay . No . No . No , no , no , no ! No , stay back . ( Dr. Kellino ) No , stay back . Oh , my God . Your wound has healed . Nim healed you , didn 't he ? Please . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Wake up ! Come on , wake up ! Come on , he 's coming back . He 's coming back , all right . Come on , you just gotta hang in there . That 's it ! Come on ! Hey , hey , come on ! Get up here ! He 's coming . Yes ! Here ! Please ! No ! Hey , down here , you son of a bitch ! What are you waiting for ? We 're dying ! Hey ! Come on ! Hey ! You keep doing that , we 're both gonna die ! Now , wake up ! Fight ! ( Rich ) Kick ! Come on ! This is it ! This is it ! Kick it ! Kick ! Kick ! This is humidified air . It 's gonna help regulate your core temperature . In the meantime , let me get this out of the way for you . We need to keep this with us . We got the proof . The camera 's still dry . I told you we could make it . You just gotta have ... a little faith .

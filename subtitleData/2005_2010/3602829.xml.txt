 Previously on Heroes ... Lauren , it 's great to see you . Dinner 's ready , everyone . You brought a date ? No . How did the two of you meet ? Lauren and I use to work together at Primatech . She is so a date . I 'm dead . He knows it . You know it . Why don 't you tell us why ? As far as the world is concerned , Nathan is still alive . Yeah , but I 'm not me . They are your memories . His spirit and his mind are fighting for his family . I 'm gonna find him , and I 'm gonna bring him back , Mom . It 's over . It isn 't possible anymore . I 'll find a way . Maybe I 'm just not supposed to have a normal life . It sounds like you 're giving up . I want to find out where this leads . Where did you get that ? I stole it from my dad . You need to take me back . I need to know the truth . Your brother 's powers could increase a thousandfold . It 's been my life 's work to keep him in the dark . How long have you been lying to me , huh ? You had to be controlled . You have the power to kill millions . You have betrayed me . Aah ! I know the truth , Samuel . But I have a daughter to look after , so your secret is safe with me . You wanted to see me , Samuel ? I don 't know why I bother reading these- - nothing but God-awful news ... everywhere . Makes one wonder , doesn 't it ? About what ? The nature of our lowly existence . People want to believe there 's hope everywhere , but you , then you read this . It makes you wonder if we 're not destined to be the last generation of our species . And if that 's so , how can we stop that from happening ? I-I don 't really give it much thought . Well , you really should . You grew up in this family . You 've been a loyal and trusted member your whole life . That 's why I want to ask a favor . With Edgar gone , will you do me the honor of being my right-hand man ? Or should I say men ? The honor would be all mine . Good , 'cause I need you to start by retrieving some files from the apartment of a Mr. Noah Bennet . They 'll be in a box marked " Primatech . " Who should I give this to ? Do I get to use my friends ? I think they will lend themselves very nicely to the job . Evening , Mr. Bennet . Hello , Ms. Gilmore . Come on in . You know , um ... I easily could have picked you up . You do live closer to the theater . I asked you out . Seems only fair I pick you up . Are you uncomfortable with that ? No , no , no , not at all . It 's just ... It 's been a long time since I 've dated . You know , I kind of , uh , skipped right over the sexual revolution . Who said anything about sex ? What 's all that ? Oh , that 's the bad guys . I think . I don 't know . It 's been hard to wrangle resources since Primatech folded . Mm-hmm . " Compass " ? That seems to be the key component in the mystery- - enough for them to kill for . I 've come across two of them . Here , have a look . It was right here . Well maybe you put it someplace else . No . Claire . She took it ? When she was here last night . Damn it . Voice mail . Claire , it 's me . I know you took the compass . Whatever you 're doing right now , please just stop . This is much more dangerous than you know . Call me right away . Let me guess- - We 're not gonna go to the movies tonight . Give me her number . Working for the CIA has a few benefits , like waterboarding terrorists and pretty decent bagels and the ability to triangulate cell-phone calls . - What is it ? - 703-555-0187 . When we get the cell-tower locations , we can hop on Google Maps and get a general sense of where she 's headed . Thank you . I owe you . It 'll be okay , Noah . We 'll find her . We will . We gotta be the first ones in . Dude , wait up ! We came all this way to go to a carnival ? I guess so . Hmm . The compass is locked right onto it . I always said I belonged in a freak show . I just never took it so literally . I know why you 're here . Good . Then you 'll save me from the long-winded windup . Peter , there are five stages of grief . You need to leap over denial phase and get right into the acceptance of this whole thing . He 's not dead , Mom . Sweetheart , Nathan died months ago , despite my own grand gestures of denial . No , he 's in there , in Sylar . Why do you think we 're still standing ? Nathan kept us alive . So I 'm gonna find him , and I 'm gonna take Sylar down once and for all . How do you intend to fight him with all the powers he has ? Well , it won 't be too hard once I take them away . Thanks for coming , Rene . The least I can do . Please , Peter , think about what you 're doing . I have . I 'm gonna go get Nathan back . What happens when you find out there 's not a Nathan to get back ? I guess I 'll just settle for revenge . - Maybe we shouldn 't do this . - What ? We 've been driving for 21 hours . I know . It was a stupid idea . What if we run into Psycho Becky in there ? She already tried to kill you once . Twice , actually . But you 'll protect me , won 't you ? Look , I 'm serious , okay ? You don 't have to do this . And now that I think about it , neither do I. Claire , Claire , wait . I 'm here because of you , to support you no matter what . So you have to do this . Do I ? We 've been on the road for a day . But you 've been on this road your whole life , and it 's led you here . So you have to at least check it out . Claire . So glad you could make it . I know it can look a little scary from the outside , but you 'll get used to it . Here , free passes . The whole night 's on me- - everything . You like carnivals , right ? I guess . Thank you . But , um , we are just looking . Of course you are . Although I 'm not quite sure what I 'm supposed to be seeing . It 's actually more normal than it appears . This is just the " show " part of the business . We need to make money the most honest way we can- - Going town to town , always on the move , at least for now ... Till we find a better , more permanent way to live . Hey , you two like popcorn ? Who doesn 't ? Well , this is the best popcorn in the world , and I 'm not just saying that . - Mmm . - Wow . That is good . Tell you what , stay until you finish the box . Walk around on your own . Meet my family . When you 're done , I 'll walk you back to your car . You girls can go back to school . Fair enough ? Okay . Just until you finish the box . Every tattoo , a harbinger of things to come . What is it we 're suppose to be looking at here ? I don 't know , but I 've got plenty left . You never know what future will appear before your very eyes . Every tattoo , a harbinger of things to come . Her naked skin a canvas to rival Van Gogh 's . Step right up . Pay your money . You never know what future will appear before your very eyes . Every tattoo , a harbinger of things to come . Her naked skin a canvas to rival Van Gogh 's . Step right up . Pay your money . You never know what future will appear before your very eyes . Well , this looks promising . What are we supposed to do ? You ask a question , and then you take my hand . And then what ? You 're like a fortune teller ? I show you what you need to see . Like a crystal ball ? Something like that . Go ahead . Do it . Am I supposed to be here ? Must be some kind of projector or something , right ? What , am I--am I gonna have a circus act ? This isn 't the future , Claire . This is your desire . Come on , let 's get out of here . - Hi . - Hello . Is this all for me ? You shouldn 't have . No , seriously , you really , really shouldn 't have . Listen , Peter . I 'm pretty disappointed in you . Your plan was to syringe me in the neck with drugs . Wasn 't that the old plan ? I mean , don 't get me wrong . Congrats for pulling it off in the first place . But fool me twice , you know ? Yeah , I know . What the hell did you do ? Our Haitian friend ... I took his ability ... mind-erasing and power-blocking . Now give me my brother back ! Nathan 's pretty dead , Peter . I should know . He 's still in you , and I 'm gonna get him back . What are you gonna do ... beat him out of me ? Something like that . Oh God . That hurts , doesn 't it ? No healing power . Aah ! God ! Oh , God ! What do you want ? I want to make a deal . I 'll let up . I 'll let you heal , but you give me Nathan . You give him back to me , body and soul . Sounds like a pretty one-sided deal to me . It is . So what 's it gonna be ? Aah ! You 're gonna need a lot more nails in that thing . That 's fine . I 'll just take away everything that 's you ... until Nathan is the only one left . I would love to see you try . Come on , Nathan , I know you 're in there . Go ahead . Kill me . Come on , I can 't do this alone . Please . Pete . Is it really you ? What did she mean about seeing your desires ? No idea . Do you have some secret desire to be a circus performer ? Not that I know of . Well , this place is starting to give me the willies , so maybe we should just- - It 's kind of amazing , though . I mean , these people have all figured out a way to use their abilities . They 're conning people , Claire . At least they 're living out in the open . In a freak show . Look , I can think of worse things . Try having the government hunt you down . Maybe I can be the girl who gets sawed in half every night . Now , that 's something to aspire to . Yeah . Give me three more balls . I 'm going for that big stuffed tiger . That 's not fair . You 've had your turn . Uh , buh-buh . Watch and learn , missy . Three years pitching in the minors , dude . I 'm gonna clean you out . Ooh ! Ouch ! Hey , that ball was headed right down the middle . What the hell did you do ? I 'm not the one that pitched in the minors for three years . Double or nothing . All right , it 's your money , man . How 's he doing it ? Watch his right hand . Sorry . All right , little lady , your turn . So that guy was a jerk , but it doesn 't give him the right to rip him off . - Wow ! - Yay ! - Whoo ! - Alright ! Congratulations . Thank you so much . All right , who 's next ? Let 's go . Come on , three balls for a dollar . Looks like our time is up . Be our next big winner . And you , sir ! Come on , the little girl just won the grand prize . Evening , ladies . Hope you liked what you saw . Not really . If you 're interested , uh , I can show you backstage , where we all live . - We 'd love to . - No , thanks . You 're more than welcome to join us . We don 't exclude anyone here . Come on , step right up ! Here we go . All of Southern Ohio- - That 's great , needle in a haystack . Hard to believe we bagged and tagged every one of these people . You 're not gonna find any leads in there . Carnival 's a nest we never came across . I 'm gonna try cross-referencing these with the CIA database , see what I can find there . Let it go , Noah . Girls lie to their fathers . You 're not the only one . I deserve it . Like father , like daughter . Lying is a stock in trade in our line of work . And you reap what you sow . All right , fine . If you want to wallow , have at it . Unload . I 've driven everyone away with my suffocating need for control . Oh , come on . Everyone ? Sandra , Claire ... You . - Me ? - Yes . You . This ought to be good . Lauren , we ... had something together . What , at Primatech ? I definitely thought you were cute , but we never had feelings for each other . We did , actually . No , we didn 't . We had breakfast twice a week for almost six months , and ... We talked about everything . Well , I think I would remember that . Not if you had your memory erased . You had my memory erased ? No . You did it yourself . It was over before it began . We both knew it was gonna end badly , and you chose the high road . I Haitian 'd myself . This isn 't the way I wanted to tell you ... but you deserve to know the truth . And what , this- - Now you 're single , playing the field , and you thought what , you could reignite the flame ? Mr. Bennet ? Who wants to know ? Name 's Eli . Uh , I 'm an emissary . An emissary from where ? Sullivan Brothers Carnival . You mind if I , uh , come in ? I 'd rather you stay where you are . Now , now ... Where are your manners ? What do you want ? Something you have , and we want . We don 't want anyone to get hurt . So we 'll just take what we came for , and we will be on our way . Bathroom ! - He 's a multiplier . - I know . Okay , that 's what I call being prepared . One of them is a prime . We shoot him , we get rid of the rest . It took us two weeks to find the one in Tulsa . What 's the plan here ? Shoot them all and hope for the best . Gone . So are your files . From time to time , the ogre would return , always bringing presents to the boys and girls of the village . Even though the grown-ups feared him , hated him , the children knew ... he was harmless , because children always know . Right ? You got to admit , it 's nowhere near as creepy behind the scenes . That 's because it 's dark out . It 's just like any other carnival . Except for the part about the superpowered con artists . Everybody knows that the games at carnivals are rigged . And I don 't see the problem with doling out a little karma . I mean , they let the little girl win a prize , right ? They 're exploiting their abilities , Claire . I don 't see you running around conning people with yours . Hey , Barbie ... Doyle ? Hey . What are you doing here ? We were just in the neighborhood . How long have you been here ? Since you helped me leave Costa Verde . I kind of kicked around for a while , tried to stay under the radar . It didn 't work out so good . And then Samuel found me , and everything changed . It is amazing living here . I finally belong someplace . I can be completely myself . You have no idea what that 's like . I need to talk to you about this . Are you gonna be here for a while ? Yeah . Yeah , a little bit . I have to go strike my set , and I 'll talk to you in a bit . Okay . Okay . Explain to me how you 're BFFs with a carny ? He kidnapped me once , tried to get my mom to shoot me , but ... I got over it . Excuse me ? Claire . The children want to hear one more story before they go to bed . Why don 't you tell us one ? No . Oh , I don 't--I don 't think I know any stories . Of course you do . We all have stories . Uh , okay ... Hmm . Once upon a time ... there was a frog . And the frog lived in a far-away land with mom , dad , brother , and a tadpole named Mr. Muggles . And the frog always wanted to be special . What is it you people want from her ? It 's not fair to toy with her emotions like this . She 's vulnerable , you know ? We live in troubling times , do we not ? That doesn 't answer the question . Families encompass ... all manner and shape . But the defining ingredient is love . Now , we don 't profess to offer much , but love , we have ... in ample supply . Something that changed everything . I 'm tired , Pete . Yeah , I know . No , I mean I 'm tired . I 've been trying to get out , fight my way , and I don 't think I can do it anymore . I don 't think I can hang on . Sure you can . You know what ? Let 's go get some air . I know just the place . And after they saved the world from total destruction , the frog went back to its family with all that it had learned , and they all lived happily ever after . All right , children , time for bed . No . No more stories . Come on , lets go . Good night . - Bye . - They love you . Who 's in charge here ? Sorry , sir . This is a restricted area . Where 's the man in charge ? You 're looking at him , friend . You 're not my friend . You stole my money . Well , I 'm sure there must be some mistake . We--we don 't steal money from our customers . The hell you don 't . Now give me my damn money back . We offer our customers games of chance . And as such , you obviously took a chance , and you lost . The game was rigged . Or you don 't possess the proper skill level to win . We all have talents , certain talents , friend- - God-given gifts , but perhaps the good Lord forgot to hand a sufficient one out to you ? Well , how 's this for a gift . Oh , my God ! Why isn 't he fighting back ? It 's clear our friend has a point he has to make . Let him speak his piece . Okay , that 's enough ! Really ? I 'll take you on . I 'll take on any of you freaks . You can 't hurt us . Remember the last time we were up here ? Yep . Yeah , I do . You were standing on that edge right there ... like an idiot ... asking me about Dad 's depression ... asking me if I could fly . Remember what you said ? I said we could both fly . No , no , no . Before that . You denied it . It was an election year . Denial was the go-to . It seems like a million years ago , huh ? A lifetime . And we made it through it ... together . Made it through all the craziness , you and me . We can make it through anything , Nathan . Even death ? Why not ? Because this isn 't me . It 's not my body . Because it 's Sylar 's . No . It is you . Nathan , I 'm looking at you . You 're looking at an illusion . No , it 's you . Look , I need you to keep fighting in there , okay ? I can 't . He 's killing me . And I can 't hold on anymore , Pete . Yes , you can , Nathan . That 's- - That 's why you found me . That 's why you came and found me . I found you because I wanted to crucify you in Times Square . Nathan , that is not you . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . Whoa . Nathan , stay with me . - Hey , hey ! Fight it . - Aah ! Come on , I need you to fight it . I need you to fight it , Nathan . Come on , stay with me , bud . Please . Come on . I 'm sorry , Pete . Nathan ! Pull yourself up , Nathan . Let me go , Pete . I can 't do that . You need to accept that I 'm gone . I need you to help me . Now , pull yourself up , please . You 're gonna have to carry on for the both of us , Pete . Okay ? You tell Mom I love her . You take care of Claire . Fight the good fight . You 've always been everything that 's good in the world , Pete . Nathan . And I got a feeling the world ain 't seen nothing yet . I can 't do this without you . You can do anything , Pete ... Anything . Remember that . I love you . Nathan ? Aah ... I love you , Nathan . Why did you let him do that to you ? Life is a series of choices ... One of the many I 'm forced to make to preserve the well-being of this family . You could 've defended yourself . Yeah , easily . But we 're gypsies , Claire . We weigh our decisions very carefully when dealing with the outside world . The path of least resistance is sometimes the wisest . It 's not right . No , it isn 't . We 're not that different , are we ? We 're both learning new things about ourselves , both searching for new ways to live our lives on our own terms . But you found that out here . Have we ? You all get to be what you want to be , out in the open , right in front of people . If we lie , bow our heads , keep our mouths shut ... let some creep punch our face and not hit him back , oh , yeah . I 've been sold a bill of goods my whole life ... taught how to be comfortable being a second-class citizen . And now I 'm questioning that , and so are you . I know what you were thinking , walking around tonight , that this place is ... awfully strange , yet strangely familiar . Am I right ? I don 't know what I 've been thinking . Yes , you do , and you were right . We all think it 's a little strange . A carnival ? It 's the only life most of us have ever known . But we can be more . We can be bigger ... if we can just figure out how . And I have a strong feeling , Claire Bennet , that you can help us do just that . I think it 's time ... for some soul searching . And you 're welcome to stay a few days and do just that ... before you go back to school . God , this whole night just felt like a bad Fellini film . Ooh , 21-hour drive . Want to take the first shift ? What now ? I 'll see you Monday . What ? I 'm gonna stay , just for a couple days . We got two more days before break ends , and ... I know that it 's hard to explain . I just ... You need to see for yourself . I get it . I saw your face , Claire- - The way you looked at them ... Like you belonged ... Like you knew them . God , I 've never had that feeling anywhere in my whole life . I 'm happy for you . I 'll see you Monday . I hope so . I 'll make this right , Lydia . It 'll all make sense soon , Joseph , the gathering of the others- - All of it . You 've gone to great lengths to bring her here . She is awfully innocent . I 'm not sure she 's going to serve a purpose for you . It 's not her I 'm after . My brother Joseph had the right idea . He believed that alone , this family would be safe . And that idea has worked for us for years . But how long can we live like this , wandering in the desert without a home ? Times change , and we need to change with them . We need to stop running , stop living in the shadows . We should be stronger . The problem is , there 's simply too few of us to make a stand . If we are truly to be great , we need to grow our ranks , bring in new members . And the newest among us cannot be shackled with the same burden we 've borne- - wandering like Nomads . They deserve a home ... A promised land . Now , I 've thought a lot about exactly where this homeland should be . And I keep coming back to this very spot . Here we will plant roots and build a life , a community . Here we will be oppressed no longer . Here we will live our lives on our own terms . But none of that can happen until we have gathered the rest . And when we have done that , we will return to this place . We will wander no longer . We will finally ... be home .

 Years ago , I swear you said you were just a simple professor . You left out the top-secret warehouse full of madcap . Claudia . You 're the breach . Knock knock . Your brother Joshua visits you and tells you he 's not dead ? He 's stuck . Help me bring him back . Thanks . For not giving up . Claudia learned a great deal about the warehouse , which could become problematic . You know what the options are . And this . And this . What artifact did that ? Or is that the artifact ? It was created by a little-known sculptor Walter Burleigh , and it was stolen late last night from a high-end auction house in New York . But that 's not the issue . The issue is how this thing was stolen , because ... I 'm trying to figure out why ... After I just got back into this world you 're in such a rush to shove me out the door . Because I didn 't spend half my life trying to save your life so you could surf the net and watch Youtube . Well , excuse me for trying to catch up on current events and the state of the world in the last 12 years . Hey , we 're working . We 're working right here . Artie , I 'm sorry , but apparently I have to find a job . Don 't know exactly what I 'm gonna put in that little gap in my resume . Well , hey , what about what got you there in the first place ? You ! What ? Don 't you have something to do ? Like stay out of federal prison ? And aren 't you supposed to be writing me a full technical schematic on how you cracked my warehouse ? Yeah , buddy . It 's upstair . It 's almost finished . Well then , I want you to finish it , and i want every redirect and every backslash . Go . Now . And then after that , you 're going into the warehouse and you 're gonna re-wire what you unwired when you broke in . I 'd like to unwire you . Ah . The patter of little feet . All right , so , Artie , somebody boosts an ugly sculpture . Why does that involve us ? Okay , what is signifiant here is how this thing was stolen . I mean , this theft was ... impossible . There was a high-end alarm system , eight-inch thick walls , sealed vault . So one seond that culpture was there , next second gone . But it 's still just a well-executed art theft . I mean , it doesn 't automatically shout " warehouse , " does it ? Things rarely shout " warehouse . " They usually whisper , " hey , that 's a little odd . " That 's what they do . Well , I could be wrong . I mean , it could be nothing . But I 'm probably not wrong . Last time I was wrong was 1987 , June . Stop right there . That . I want to hear more about that . Not a chance . Go . Okay . Here we go . Going . Go , go , go , go . Hey , Artie . Yeah ? Hey , uh , you know I love New York . Oh , a great town . It is . Yeah . So I was just thinking maybe you guys could kick down some tickets to a show , or ... ? Well , it depends on the show . Really ? No . Get out of here . Show . Like you 're even gonna have time for a stupid musical . Or that I 'd even pay for it . Off Broadway 's not that expensive . Carruther ' auction house prides itself on security . This theft has us stumped . Video surveillance shows nothing . I 'm assuming you use an electronic lock that records all activity . And it says the door never opened . Who 's selling the piece ? Private estate . He decided to auction after he was approached by two interested parties , Both with deep pockets . When is this auction , uh , scheduled ? It was for today . Uh , I hate to ask , but would you mind ? Oh . You know , maybe one of these interested parties hates competition . Which would mean that said party has an artifact that lets them pull off an impossible heist . Or the simple answer , an inside job . She does bear scrutiny . Follow me . Yes , ma 'am . She 's out of your league . How do you know what my league is ? Not that I ask for them , but I 've got season tickets . That 's good . I like it . So the thief takes one piece . Was it the most valuable one in here ? Oh , far from it . But there 's no accounting for taste . Oh , I don 't know . Some things are just classic . Pete . Yeah ? Come here for a second ? Hmm ? Why don 't I , uh , stay here in the vault and look for anything , you know , " warehousey " , And you go check out those two interested parties ? Well , wouldn 't things go quicker if we just worked together ? Well , not if you 're on a date . Look , this way we can cover twice as much ground , and maybe you 'll even get done in time to take , uh , skirt girl to a show . Two interested parties , huh ? I 'll get their info . Great . I 'll , uh , go with . Batter up . Agent Lattimer ? Hey . Gilbert Radburn . Yeah , I 've seen your name on a few buildings . Good . That 's why I put it up there . What can I do for you ? You were interested in the sculpture that was stolen last night , the Burleigh ? I was . And as you might guess , I 'm not fond of losing . What 's the secret service 's interest ? How it was stolen . Which was ? You mind telling me where you were last night ? Ha . I have no need to steal . Well , sometimes it 's not about stealing . It 's about conquering . Like putting your name on a building . I was with friends . All night ? This is the city that never sleeps . You want names ? Yes , please . That would be swell . Also , why the Burleigh ? What 's so speial about it ? Eye of the beholder , Agent Lattimer . Eye of the beholder . Yeah , I 'll get you those name . Thank you , sir . What 's up ? You should get back here . You got something ? I found something behind one of the crates , but it 's easier to show and tell . What is it ? You 're not gonna believe this , but ... I smell fudge . I 'll be right there . What are we talking about here ? Well , it 's right here . You can see it . Right ? What the hell ? Okay . Easy . Oh . Huh . Pete , no . No . Artifact behavior usually requires a human element , right ? Yeah . Just be careful . Okay . Okay ? Okay . Wow . Oh , my God . Check it out . It 's crazy . Okay , you see this is one of those artifacts that I 'd really like to keep . Pete , put it in . Hey , Rocky , watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat . Now that 's cool . Ouch . That 's what I thought . What ? That pinching cause pain ? No . No , I know that . But the feather , it only works up to your elbow . So not enough to get in and out with the sculpture . Exactly , which means that this is only part of the artifact . It 's not the whole thing . Oh . At least that narrows it down . We 're looking for an arts-dealing bird that walks through wall . Like Artie always says ... Never rule anything out . Show me . Okay . Looks native american . Yeah , we think it fell off something larger , a ceremonial object , a walking stick , a peace pipe maybe . Or a bird . Yeah . Any guess as to who this thing belonged to ? Uh , well , maybe one of the two guys who wanted to buy the sculpture , but we haven 't interviewed one of them yet . Radburn 's too rich to risk it . He could outbid Donald Trump . I think we can rule him out . No no ... Never rule anything out . Okay , uh , well , the second guy 's a rich dude . His name 's Jeffrey Weaver . Jeffrey Weaver . Is that the son of Alexander Weaver ? Um , Artie , who is Alexander Weaver ? Yeah , was . He was an extortionist , a real estate swindler . And a ravager of cultures . Not a nice man . Now deceased . And ... yes . Son Jeffrey lives in New York . So ... Look , unless the acorn fell very far from the tree , watch your backs . Hmm . Which one are you ? Let 's see . Is it that one ? Whoa ! Oh . Geez . Hey . Chill , Sparky . Uh , how 's it going ? You mean are you scared I 'm gonna burn the house down ? Emergency exits are clearly marked . You think my concern for you is insincere ? I think you should pass me the cable shears . Those . So ... anxious to get on with your life ? Such shocking insight . Did my aura tell you that ? You 're certainly pushing Joshua . Only ' cause he needs it . Oh , you do have a thing for him . You 're changing the subject . You brought him up . Now that you 've saved him , your life 's work is complete , and that scares you . So you 're forcing your own need for a purpose onto him . Genius . And all done without a couch . How much do I owe you , Dr. Freud ? If Joshua accomplishes great things , then your sacrifice is justified . But you 're also afraid of being alone . Truly alone . It 's okay if I don 't like you , right ? Of course . But you do . Mr. Weaver will be right with you . Thank you . Wow . Call the cops . Crime solved . It 's not what it looks like . No ? Because what it looks like is that you 're in possesion of stolen goods . Take a closer looks . That 's not the one that was stolen . There were four in the series , each named for one of the four elements . This one is fire . The stolen one is wind . Check with the auction house . How can you tell ' em apart ? You 're a trained expert with a scrupulous eye for detail . Or you read the brass plaque on the base . Jeff Weaver . Myka Bering . Pleasure . Uh , right . Um , you mind telling us where you were last night ? Hosting a charity event for the children 's hospital in New Orleans . Rich , good looking , likes kids . Who 's on a date now ? Okay , uh , you said that there were four sculptures ... Earth , wind , and fire ? Love those guys . Rock , wind , and fire , actually , and water . Right . It 's the artist 's tribute to native american creation myth . Native americans , huh ? You into that stuff ? Well , it 's an interest . You wouldn 't happen to be missing a feather would you ? Maybe off something that lets you walk through walls ? What 'd you just say ? You got a lousy poker face there , Jeffy . New Orleans is , what ? A three hours flight away ? You 're still on our suspect list . Lacell , get in here . Whoa . Hey . Hold it right there . Don 't move . Let me see your hands . What is it ? This dude was at Radburn 's construction site . Yeah , he was giving me the stink-eye . It 's all right . His name is Lacell . He works for me . We 'll decide when it 's all right , okay ? He also works for Radburn . It 's ... it 's complicated . Okay , wait . You work for Weaver and Radburn ? Look , Lacell 's not the problem . If what you said about someone walking through walls is true , the sculpture isn 't safe . You think they 're coming after this one next , don 't you ? We 're standing right here . I think we got it covered . Thank you , but I can provide my own protection . That 's not an offer , okay ? If somebody 's walking through walls , the United States government needs to know who and how . All I can tell you is that this sculpture is the next target , so please let me move it to a secure location . Okay , well , hold on . What 's that , Badgey ? hmm ? Oh , okay . Sorry . Badgey says we stay with the sculpture . So wherever it goes , we go . No , no , no , no . Don 't touch that in the middle of the game . With whom ? Myself . White 's been backed into a corner by black . I 'm waiting for a eureka moment to save white 's butt . Been waiting a while ? Huh ? Three months . Why ? Oh , Claudia was looking it over . Noticed you were in a bit of a pickle . She noticed i was in a pickle . Where is the little demon ? Oh , she 's in there . She 's got work to do . She ... Artie ... Artie . She 's taking a break . She 's been working very hard . I hate that look . Claudia ... Here it comes . Needs a home . This is not the humane society . She 's not a stray cat . She 's not staying here . Mrs. Frederic is getting antsy as it is . I 'm not suggesting she stays here . Artie , you can pull strings ... M.I.T. , CalTech . Please . She needs a challenge . Yeah . Artie , she needs people . She 's got Joshua . And Joshua 's on his own path . Yes , they 're both brilliant , but he 's a researcher , and she 's a doer . She needs people like her . Brash , rude , anti-social , impulsive ? We 're discussing Claudia , not you . See , that 's kind of a low blow . You 're so brash , rude ... What are you doing ? No , no , no , no ! Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! Check . I 'll be damned . Well , maybe , but I 'm not one to judge . White beats black in nine moves . Whoa . Oh ! Ow . Hey , is the sculpture okay back there ? Yes , it 's fine . I 'm ... I 'm fine too , by the way . Thank you for asking . Hey , would you tell Chief Leadfoot to take it easy ? And how much longer till we reach the airport , anyway ? Pete , is everything okay ? Pete . Stop the truck . Stop the truck ! Aah ! Pete , are you okay ? Pete , look at me . Hey , stop ! Pete ? Ii need an ambulance right away . Pete . Hey , partner . How are you feeling ? Sore . Everywhere . Need cookies . You 've been out for a while . Remember anything ? I had my molecules rearranged , and got shoved out the side of a moving truck . That about sums it up . Not surprisingly , it gives you quite a headache . You know , I told Artie what you said about the buckskin coat before you passed out . And the creation myth . He 's doing his thing . Yeah , I don 't get it . I mean , this guy could be robbing Fort Knox . Why the sculpture ? Guess that 's our little puzzle , isn 't it ? Mm . The pretty boy . Boom chika boom boom . What is he doing here ? Jeff got you a free , multi-point inspection . Make sure all your part are where they belong . Oh , Jeff did . Yes , Jeff did . He , um , owns the hospital , or built it or something . Well , that 's handy . Ahem . He asked me to dinner . It 's 3 : 00 a.m. Well , in the cafeteria . Big spender . But I said no . Ah , you should go . No , I should stay here with you . Nah . No . I mean , Pete ... Myka . Pete . This guy knows what 's going on . Go for it . You know , use your feminine wiles . Smile . You 're pretty when you smile . I am ? Yeah . So what does that mean when I 'm not smiling ? Kind of frightening . Head injury . Nurse . Something I said ? I was just gonna come tell you . Here I am . Yeah , you were right . I have to go . Wow . Zero to 10 . I didn 't mean today . I was just looking for some forward momentum . Yeah , well , Artie made a few calls . And , uh , there 's a position at Cern . I should take it . It 's once in a lifetime . You 're going to Switzerland ? Yeah . Smashing atoms ? Like you said , can 't spend the rest of my life listening to Springsteen and surfing the web . Hey . If an interdimensional rift can 't keep me from being in touch with you , you think a few thousand miles will ? Well , you better . 'Cause I think I 've demonstrated I will hunt you down . Yeah . Well , come here . Come on . Pete 's fine , but somebody else could get hurt . I mean , where does that buckskin coat come from ? Is it connected to the sculpture somehow ? There are hundreds of these native American creation myths . I know , I know . I still think that the feather , however , gives us our best clue . Anyway , the feather was predominantly used by the Delaware nations , and also by the ... Aha . By the Lenape tribe . They 're the ones who sold Manhattan to the Dutch for 24 bucks worth of arts and craft . That 's not a great deal . You had to be there . And according to Lenape legend , the world was created through the spirits of four elements . Four . Fire , which gave us our soul . Wind , our breath . Water , death . It 's fascinating . And rock , which gave the w ... Leena . Rock gave the world ... solidity . So someone has a buckskin coat that manipulate solidity . No . I think that this whole thing could be a pattern . Because if there are artifacts that control the other elements , and somebody were to acquire those artifacts , that somebody would have immense power over ... The world . At the risk of sounding dramatic . That 's never stopped you before . That 's true . Mama ? Ow . Ooh , ooh . A ... ooh ! Pete , what took you so long ? Uh , listen . Jeffrey Weaver ... I think that that guy needs a second look . Myka 's taking a look at him now over dried turkey , mushy vegetables , and tapioca pudding . Okay . You 're still in the hospital ? I got pushed out of the side of a steel truck . I 'm recuperating . Yeah , well , recuperate later . While Myka 's keeping Weaver busy , uh , I 'm gonna need you to toss his apartment . Why steal his stuff from himself ? Is weaver our guy ? Well , tell me what you find out , and I will let you know . It 's very romantic . I had , uh , Verna turn up the steam tables . It 's all about atmosphere . Well , you sure know how to wow a girl . It 's my best move . So what made you join the secret service ? Well , um ... it was either that or prison . I 'm kidding . What about you . I mean , what is it you do exactly ? Accrue interest . Re-invest . Try to do something good with it . That 's a nice life . Yeah , well , it depends on how you got it . Your father . My father , yeah . And you don 't ... you don 't want to follow in his footsteps . Is that it ? I want to erase his footsteps . What ? What ? I 'm just trying to decide if i 'm sitting here with a good guy or a bad guy . You know who was in business with Radburn years ago ? The other guy who wanted the sculpture ? That 's right . Jeffery Weaver 's father . And both those guys tried to push really hard at that time to sell them , all four of the sculptures . Yeah . What do they do ? I don 't know . I guess , you know , something happens when you put all four sculptures together . My best guess , something ... Bad . Bad . Something bad . You find anything at Weaver 's yet ? No , I don 't know . This place is clean . If he 's the guy with the coat , he probably ... Oh , come on . What ? It 's probably nothing . I 'll call you back . No , no , no . Wait , wait . What ? You got to be kidding me . What a hack . Bingo mania . So what are you really after in all this ? And don 't tell me the government needs to know . I 'm here for the coat . And , yeah , the government actually does want it . There are certain things that just shouldn 't be out in the world . True . But , you , you 're only interested in the sculptures . Why ? They 're not that valuable . I think things that were created together belong together . Whoever 's doing this , and I haven 't ruled you out yet , is also collecting them . What happens when the four sculptures are together ? Seriously , Jeff , you should tell me , before somebody ... Just give me a seond . Pete ? Is everything okay up there ? Yeah , I 'm at Weaver 's . What ? Wh ... what are you ... the guy 's got a secret room that 's a shrine to Burleigh . He must have bought up everything the guy ever touched . Whatever 's going on , your boyfriend 's neck deep in it . I 'll wrap this up then . So we should probably head upstairs , huh ? You know , I 'd really rather go back to your place . You know , it 's funny . I usually like it when a beautiful woman says that . That is funny . That is funny . Because I never like it when my date lies to me . You know , I don 't ... Burleigh was married to a Lenape woman . And the sculptures are some kind of a key to a sacred , underground cave . To a sacred what ? A cave . Uh , it says it contains four offerings to the spirit of creation . Somehow he hid the directions to the cave In the sculptures . So those four sculptures , see , they 're a map . If you put the four sculptures together , they tell you where this cave is . Yeah , but how , Artie ? I mean , we 're missing something . Mr. Radburn , we found this man trying to break in . It 's Lacell , right ? What do you do for me , Mr. Lacell ? Geologial surveys , sir . That 's right . You see what 's underground , don 't you ? And yet here you are , lurking very high above ground . Find anything interesting ? No , sir . You 're not a very good liar , Mr. Lacell . And you work for Mr. Weaver . Don 't waste your breath with denial . Was he wearing it ? Yes , sir . Let me have it . Tell me about this . It 's nothing . My father gave it to me . Don 't you mean your uncle ? As I said before , deception is not your strong suit . Walter Burleigh was your uncle , wasn 't he ? Why do you think that I hired you ? I had hoped you would lead me to the place . Your uncle hid clues to the sacred cave in his art . What 's this ? Water , rock , wind . Well , that 's helpful . Now I know how to arrange the sculptures . Wait for me outside . But what then ? How does it work ? How will they lead me to the place where the objects are hidden ? I don 't know . Give that back . You have what you want . Do you want to leave here alive , Lacell ? Oh , is there more ? " The truth is in the dawn . " What does it mean ? I don 't know . " The truth is in the dawn . " What does it mean ? I don 't know ! I don 't know . I suppose you didn 't know . " The truth is in the dawn . The truth is in the dawn . " I ... I don 't know what that means , but it 's ... it 's written all over Burleigh 's notes . What 's ... what 's written ? Uh ... dawn . This ... I mean , I don 't know . Uh , creation , maybe . Tony Orlando and . Creation ... or destruction . Yeah . Look , Artie , how much of this stuff do we really believe ? Well , enough that if he 's looking for this cave , It 's better that we find it first . I would agree with that . Your partner 's already got me covered . Lucy , you 've got some ' splaining to do . So where 's the code ? Gilbert Radburn beat me to it , same way he 's been trying to find the cave . What cave ? Underground , sacred . Check it out . We have to stop him . Like you said , there are some things that should not be out in the world . Yeah , well , what about that big guy that works for the two of you ? Lacell is Lenape . He wants to save the cave too . He 's been my eyes at Radburn 's digs . He hasn 't checked in either . I think something 's happened . Okay , so we have to find this cave before Radburn does . Well , if he 's got all four sculptures , he could be there now . We 've got all of Burleigh 's note right here . Well , that hasn 't helped me solve it yet . True , Mr. Weaver . But ... you 're not me . And right now we need to find the location of that cave before Radburn does . The truth is in the dawn . Of course . It 's a map . Thank you . So Burleigh stopped taking notes when he got close to finding the cave . Yeah . It 's like he realize the stories were true and stopped writing anything down . Well , you know , I think it may be enough because I found all these old maps , and I ... Knock knock . I wish you wouldn 't do that . God ! Not funny . H ... h ... hang on . I just came by to grab my tool and then I 'm hitting the proverbial road . I 'm thinking Vegas . " Really ? Vegas , Claudia ? Remember , always hit on 16 , never on 17 . " There 's gotta be a Lenape settlement here somewhere and it 's gotta be somewhere safe . Yeah , and they 'd look for a place with special properties . It 's gotta be ... it 's gotta be somewhere safe . So ... no , this is not ... What ... hey , hey ! Dude , have you considered matching these against magnetic ley lines ? No , you don 't ... One runs right along the east edge of the island . Right there . This is the south ... An underground cave in Manhattan , huh ? You know , if no one 's run into it ... in all these years , then we can eliminate everywhere where they 've dug for major utility junctions ... and subways . This looks right . Indeed it does . Guys , I think I 've got it . I 've got it . It is lower east side . Corlear 's hook . That is , um ... That is just south of the Williamsburg bridge , and it 's right near the water , and it 's gotta be away from the subway lines . And Claudia pointed ... out ... the ... uh ... Radburn 's building there . He 's been digging everywhere that Burleigh focused using new construction to cover his hunt . Then he 's close to finding it . Okay , Artie , we 're heading out . Yeah , okay , feel free to hurry . Yeah . All right , I need to get right here . Right next to this cave . How long will that take ? We can blow it in five minutes . I need the contents of the cave to be intact . Nothing can be disturbed . Content ? Well , if it 's a surgical blow , I say we blast right here next to it and go sideways the last couple of feet by jackhammer . You just get me next to that cave . I 'll take care of everything else . Let 's go . Okay . Your site 's just 18 inches the other side of that wall . Let me get a couple guys with jackhammer . No one comes near here , you understand ? It 's true . It 's all true . The water of eternal life . Oh . Whoa ! He shall have the power of nature herself . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! Gilbert Radburn . Where is he ? Down in the blast site . But I 'm getting out of here . Let 's go . He shall have the strength of a hundred men . And he shall harness the strength of the earth . Hey , you kind of got your hands full , don 't you ? Don 't , Gil . You don 't know what you 're dealing with . You 're too late , Jeff . This is what I was meant to do . Nut bag . The nuttiest . Okay , Radburn , drop the arrow . Put it back , Gil . It 's not for us . Not for you , Jeff . You 're weak . And so was your father . Unh ! Ohh ! Listen to me . You don 't know what you 're doing . The fourth element completes the transformation . Then nothing can stop me . How fitting that this place should be your tomb . No , no , no , it 's not meant for you . They 're meant for the man who 's strong enough to use them . Argh ! Knock knock . Oh , God . Don 't do that ! That just never stops being funny , don 't you think ? Oh , never . What are you doing ... What happened with Vegas ? It was too easy . You didn 't . Just a little pocket money . Shouldn 't you be in college or something ? Don 't you want to be with people your own age ? Artie , I 'm not my own age . Come on . Writing english papers and going to frat parties ? Bor-ing ! I mean , at least here , you know , there 's , um ... there 's a challenge . That there is . You up for it ? Question is , geezer ... Are you ? Oh , you are so out of your league .

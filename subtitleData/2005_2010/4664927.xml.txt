 Next up is batter number 4 . in Japan . } although I had never heard of either of them before I began to feel sympathy for the losing team and I started rooting for them for some odd reason . my mobile began to ring . huh ? right ? We 're all meeting in front of the station at exactly 2 o ' clock . She cut me off completely . How did she know I was free today ? I 'm actually ... I don 't really have anything to do ... going ! Over left field ! And it 's out of here ! What ? I forgot to tell you something . Bring your swimsuit and come on your bike . okay ? That 's all . Over ~ No way . What 's going on exactly ? Kashima just finished rounding third base ... Pitcher Suzuki seems to be crumpled in a state of hopelessness . This is quite a painful sight to see . isn 't it ... And it 's their final year too ... I guess it can 't be helped . His teammates seemed to have lost their voices . The pitcher doesn 't offer even a single word of consolation . the score is 8 - 0 . This has become quite a torturous battle . 379 ) } Endless Eight Kyon ! Can 't you put more effort into it ? Who do you think you are ? You made the Brigade Chief wait ! I say ! Penalty ! I even made sure to come 15 minutes early ... Why am I always last ? let 's get going . you 'll carry Mikuru-chan . Yuki and I will sit behind Kyon . but where to ? of course ! we should have summer activities like what people do in the summer ! We can 't get back the time we waste so we 're going to go right now . This is our once-in-a-lifetime freshman summer vacation ! huh ... the smell of chlorine . It feels just right ! Take that ! And that ! No Diving - Dangerous ! Hurry up and get in ! and feels good ! Can 't she see the signs that say " No Diving " all over the place ? isn 't it ? Don 't you think Suzumiya-san may have found a normal way of enjoying things ? and then hung up on me after stating her one-sided demands . You can 't exactly say that 's normal . seeing as Suzumiya-san is laughing so joyfully like this there shouldn 't be anything happening that will endanger the world . { Not sure about these two lines } If only that were true ... There 's no need to worry . Nothing problematic has happened since that trip we took . the world is at peace . Let 's have lunch soon . We 've got Mikuru-chan 's homemade sandwiches ! It 's very tasty . Thank you very much . I 'm going to take another piece of fried chicken . pass me the tea . Okay . it is peaceful . Sorry ! here I go ! public ( shimin ) sounds a bit like masses ( shomin ) } public ( shimin ) sounds a bit like masses ( shomin ) Mikuru-chan ? Spending summer vacation like this isn 't so bad . Kyon ! These are my brigade members . so tell them anything ! Okay ! but ... What do you think ? What 's this ? An itinerary for how we should spend what little remains of summer ! For the SOS Brigade ? Exactly ! There 's only two more weeks left of summer vacation even though there 's still a bunch of stuff that I want to do . We 're getting serious from here on out ! I see . " Activities we must do during summer . stargazing ... isn 't there ? huh ? Is there anything else that you want to do ? Um ... I want to scoop up goldfish . Okay ! " Goldfish scooping . We 'll start carrying this out tomorrow ! does anyone know if there 's going to be an Obon festival happening nearby ? I 'd like to have a fireworks festival too . At least research these things before we carry them out . I 'll look into it . I 'll contact you later . and don 't forget about goldfish scooping . after all . Will do . Why do I always end up paying ? so isn 't it obvious ? Don 't make us wait again tomorrow . you 're all dismissed for today ! Man ... does that mean we 're going to be messing around every day ? from Haruhi . We 've figured out where they 're going to have an Obon festival . The time : tonight . Location : the Civic Stadium . Haruhi suddenly said : Let 's all go buy yukatas together ! { TL Note : Yukata is a type of summer kimono . } so let 's go ! and rushed off to the changing rooms . This is taking quite a bit of time . The three of them finally finished changing after we endured an hour of the other female customers avoiding us . Kyon ! They match you girls very well . after all . Especially Mikuru-chan ! Just what I 'd expect from myself ! It 's cute ! My eyes can never be wrong . this certainly is top class . And it really suits her . It 's a " yes " . So this is the traditional dress of this country . but it 's wonderful . our preparations are complete . Now let 's go ! To the Obon festival venue ! huh ? It 's been ages since I last saw one . Ah ! Mikuru-chan ! They 've got the goldfish scooping that you wanted to do ! Just keep scooping non-stop ! You get 200 points if you get the one with black eyes ! Shall we do the same ? How about a competition to see who can catch more ? I 'll pass . I 'm more interested in the food stalls . Nagato ? Want to get something to eat ? You 're interested in that stuff ? This . Oh ? Sure ! 800 yen . Thirteen of them ! so we just took one . though ... isn 't it ? you wouldn 't get that many . It 's easy if you get the hang of it ! Yuki ? I bought it . I see . But why that one ? They were probably on the same wavelength or something . As aliens . okay . so let 's go ! You still want to play ? Of course ! Come on ! Here . though . Thanks . Tasty ? Good . we 've pretty much seen all of the festival . Let 's do fireworks next ! Fireworks ! Fireworks ? we might as well make the most of the day . That 's true . There was a shop over there selling them too . Let 's buy some . That sounds fun . Let 's go then ! Kakizaki ! Note : Kakizaki Hayao from the " SDF Macross : Do You Remember Love ? " movie was blown up by missiles while making fun of women it 's so pretty ! Obon festival . Fireworks . There ! we 're going to go catch bugs tomorrow ! but did you finish your summer homework ? who hasn 't even touched his yet . What are you talking about ? I finished all of that in three days . Three days ? ! I finished it in July . Finish all that tedious stuff so you can actually enjoy yourself . That 's the right way to enjoy summer ! Why is this person so smart ? The distribution of attributes is pretty random . we 're catching bugs tomorrow . The person who catches the most gets ... Let 's see ... The position of Brigade Chief for one day ! no thanks . Sounds interesting . So it counts as long as it 's any kind of bug ? Hm ... cicada 's only ! this 'll be the SOS Brigade 's cicada catching competition ! The person with the most wins ! The next day . but unfortunately Note : Teru teru bozu is a small ghost-like doll made from cloth made as a charm for good weather . it was a ridiculously nice day . the cicadas must be enjoying the day with what could be considered the best temperature of this summer . aren 't they ? Don 't know . Would they taste good as tempura ? Try that by yourself . but isn 't tempura only good because of the batter ? Does that mean cicadas would taste good too ? Apologize ! Apologize to all the tempura chefs in the country ! isn 't it weird to see five high school students gathered around with bug nets and cages ? What are you talking about ? right ? That 's not what I meant . Let 's start then . The winner gets to be Brigade Chief for a day . Ready ... Start ! She 's not listening . Looks like she really wants to win . Isn 't that fine ? Geez . I haven 't gone bug catching since elementary school . Same here . Let 's do our best . you 've caught one already ? That 's not a cicada . I see . A Hercules ? { TL Note : A Hercules beetle is a very famous and rare type of rhinoceros beetle . } Note : A Hercules beetle is a very famous and rare type of rhinoceros beetle . Announcing the results ! Mikuru-chan : one . Yuki : four . Koizumi-kun : seven . Kyon : nine . And the person with the highest score is : You don 't need to say it . We know . Me with twelve ! everyone . Don 't tell me you seriously want to make tempura out of them ? What ? You want to try it ? What makes you think that ? I was joking . We should probably go with a " catch-and-release " mentality . They might repay us with a favor in the future . Here . Go back to the mountains ! Don 't get caught again ! but all you did was catch and then release them ! The day after that . and made sure we all had a part . It was the annual sale at a local supermarket . So do your best ! We were supposed to attract customers . Thank you very much ! Here you go . Here . Why ? Why is it that even I have to dress up like this ? Isn 't there a more suitable job to do during summer ? ! And Haruhi 's leisurely profiting from this ! there 's going to be a rebellion . Now I understand how snakes feel when they shed their skin . Well said . Good work ! The manager was also happy with your work . I don 't need his gratitude . What about the pay ? This is it . This costume was the pay . I 've been wanting this for a while now . He said he 'd give it to me because of Mikuru-chan . I think I 'll decorate the club room with this frog in commemoration ! you can wear this whenever you want . I give you my permission . Pool . Obon festival . Bug catching . Part-time job . The next activity Haruhi decided on was stargazing . So this is a telescope from this time period . It doesn 't seem so different from the ones used in Kepler 's period . I think it 's probably very different . Did you just buy this ? No . This was a hobby of mine when I was a child . I was quite touched . I found it . Mars . Where are they ? What ? Martians ! I don 't really want them to exist . Just imagine stupid octopus monsters wiggling around as they plot the conquer of Earth . I can 't imagine being an alien being fun . Why ? They could be a really friendly bunch ! They must be living quietly in a giant cave underground . It 's a testament to their timidness ! They 're probably doing it so they don 't scare us humans . Exactly how modest are these Martians that you 've got in your head ? Enough about Mars . Let 's look for UFOs . there must be scouts keeping watch somewhere . Mikuru-chan . UFO ... And summer vacation continues ! The next thing Haruhi said was : Let 's go to the batting center ! Why ? ! Note : Koushien is the name of the famous high school baseball championships in Japan . it hit me . { TL Note : Koushien is the name of the famous high school baseball championships in Japan . } We shouldn 't be satisfied with sandlot baseball . should aim for the National League ! What an impressive person . Where does she get all her energy from ? Perhaps the mitochondria in her cells are different from that of a normal person ? If only she 'd spend that energy on something beneficial to society . All right ! we continued day after day . We even went to a real fireworks show . we enjoyed the sight of flaming flowers flying up and going " boom " around us . we participated in a goby fishing contest by the river district border . Mikuru-chan ! The pole ! The pole ! Leave it to me . I 'll retrieve it . is a standard routine but no one actually does it . We went to see an overrated summer blockbuster that was advertised everywhere . We also went to the beach at the peak of jellyfish season . We had a punishment game of bowling entitled : " No One Can Leave Until Everyone Had Gotten a Strike . endurance karaoke marathon that tested the limits of our throats . I get the feeling I mixed in some completely irrelevant events we still spent two weeks of summer vacation having as much fun as possible . we 've reached August 30th and we 've pretty much gone through everything . Good grief . It ended safely . Is just this all right ? I guess it 's fine . is there anything in particular you guys want to do ? Nothing in particular for me . right ? I want to take some time to sleep . And Yuki ? I see . whatever . We did a lot this summer . and even caught a bunch of cicadas ! That 's plenty ! Does she still have some lingering regret or something ? Then let 's call it a day . but you can stay home and rest if you want . We 'll meet in the club room the day after tomorrow . Crap . I haven 't done any of my homework . August 31st . The last day of summer . Seeing as it was impossible for me to finish all of my homework and that I was tired from playing around so much I spent the day indulging myself by lounging around . Boring ... happens . Guess I 'll sleep . after all .

 Plane ticket , painting . - It points to Montreal . - What is this place ? " We were right about the company . The world 's in danger . Adam " . Please tell me who I am . What the future holds . We 'll figure it out . - We 're in New York . - Where is everyone ? - It 's an evacuation order . - June 14 , 2008 . This is next year . This thing we can do , it only begins at reading minds . And then it becomes so much more . My dad can put a thought into anyone 's head . Now we know why Molly calls him the Nightmare Man . - Bob . Looks like he 's next . - Runs the company . Sure you 're gonna be able to cure me ? In exchange , we 're going to want something from you . Hello , Dr Suresh . - You 're ... - Your new partner . Claire ! Oh , my God ! - See her face ? - Somebody could 've seen us ! Relax ! Just think of it as a lesson in humility . What 's on your neck ? I remember this man stepping out of the bushes , calling my name . - What are you talking about ? What man ? - Guy with the horn-rimmed glasses . It 's the warehouse near the train yard . You will find your paintings . I saw you , Hiro . And you , friend , betrayed me . Ah ! You can 't stop time with your nose stuck in a dollop of opium . You hear that , carp ? She thinks she loves you . Poor , pitiful you . You are supposed to be a hero . After I lead White Beard 's army , I 'll be the greatest leader Japan has known . - Hello . - Have they given you a gun ? - What are you talking about ? - A gun . Company issue . Where have you been ? I need to talk to you . Found the paintings . Series that leads to my death . - Where ? How ? - Ukraine . Old friend helped me find ' em . And I 'm looking at one of you holding a company gun . - I don 't have a gun . - These paintings are random . Need you to help make sense of ' em . Gonna forward them . Don 't ! Been trying to say they 've given me a partner . - Standard protocol . - It isn 't . - Here to watch . They don 't trust me . - My family is in danger . So that makes me expendable ? We were supposed to take the company down together , but ... I don 't know what your agenda is anymore . Dr Suresh . - I have to go . - Bob needs to see us . I get it . You don 't want a partner , but that 's not my call . You admit it . You 're a guard dog . - Where 's everyone going ? - I 'm evacuating the facility . - Why ? - I 'll let them explain it to you . - Officer Parkman . Mr Petrelli . - Matt ? - You were gonna find your father . - I did . He attacked Angela Petrelli . My father killed Kaito Nakamura . He 's killing them all . And now he 's coming to kill Bob . Hello ! Hello ! Hello ! There 's no one here , Peter . They 've all gone . Evacuated by Homeland Security . - Peter , what did you do ? - Me ? I didn 't do anything . - Are you sure ? - We were in Montr√©al . Picked up a note from some guy named Adam , says the world is in danger . Next thing , we 're here . One year in the future . I mean , how is that even possible ? Over there . Get on the ground ! Get on the ground now ! Do you have any symptoms ? - Are you sick ? - Sick ? What the hell is going on ? Take them to decontamination . Now ! - Mom , did you make waffles ? - Nope . West did . I wanted to bring you breakfast . I hope you don 't mind . Why would she mind ? Because he wasn 't invited , and some people think that 's rude ? Nonsense . Your dad and I love meeting your friends . - Will Mr Butler be joining ? - Sadly , no . His business trip was extended . Something about something I wasn 't paying any attention to . Lyle , get your butt out of bed ! He 's adorable . Why would you come here when I told you not to ? I had to show you something . Check it out . We 're infamous . Drunk cheerleader suspended . Claims that she saw a boy fly . What are we gonna do ? People are gonna know it was us . How ? It 's a blurb . On the last page of the local flavour section . - It 's no big . - It is big . You can 't just do whatever you want whenever you want . I just wanna be a part of your life . OK . But just for waffles . How do you know your father 's coming to kill Bob ? Isn 't this a bit reactionary ? No . Matt 's right . Security just found his car ditched off the road , - Maury could be here now . - Taking you into protective custody . - My priority 's to keep you safe . - Couldn 't keep Angela Petrelli safe . She almost killed herself on your watch . No , we stop Maury here now . - You realise that makes you the bait . - We all have our roles to play . That 's what Linderman used to say . My mother too . Always these half-truths . No straight answers . Constant manipulation . - I 'm trying to help everyone here . - How , Bob ? What the hell did you people do ? Why is Maury coming here to kill you ? Now is not the time to recount the past , but to focus on the task at hand . Fine , so we stay here . How do we stop my father ? Dr Suresh , I need you and Niki to inject Maury with the virus . Virus ? What virus ? Virus takes away abilities . Potentially lethal . - Said we 'd never use it . - Circumstances change . - I 'll not knowingly spread this . - Maury 's a killer . He knows your thoughts , nightmares , he could turn your world inside out . We take away his abilities , and then you can cure him with the antibodies in your blood . No one dies here today . He 's not gonna exactly volunteer for a shot . - I can be persuasive . - I appreciate the thought . - But this one goes to you , Matt . - What ? Me ? - All I can do is read minds . - No . You have the same abilities . Anything the brain controls , you control . - Senses , actions , thoughts ... - No . No ! No , I can 't . I ... I ... I can 't do any of that stuff . Learn fast because you 're the only one who could stop your father . Hiro ! Hiro ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Caitlin ! Peter Petrelli ? According to these files , you 're a dead man . What ? I got your death certificate right here . So ... you 're gonna have to explain to me , how 's a dead man walk around New York City with no sign of infection ? Infection ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Where 's Caitlin ? I need to see her . She 's from Ireland . Foreigners are deported . You can 't do that ! Who the hell are you people ? What 's going on here ? You really don 't know . On march 20th , 2007 , the first case was reported . After that , the Shanti virus spread across the globe . A pandemic . It 's killed 93 per cent of the world 's population to date . The rest of us live in quarantine praying to find a cure . - This can 't be happening . - I wish it wasn 't . - All these people died from the virus ? - Yeah , it 's been a tough week . I 'm supposed to be out hunting down Maury , but I needed to see you . I never should have asked you to use your ability to find my dad . You were just tryin ' to make me happy . I know that feeling . When my dad left I ... I blamed myself . I thought that I was too slow ... too ... fat . Too stupid . I thought that if I was better , or if I was smarter , he woulda stayed . And now they want me ... They think that I can stop him , that I 've got this power . And I don 't . I don 't . I need you to hear . I need you to know that I love you . Did you just hear me ? Molly ? I love you , Molly . What 's left of the virus is in the lab . Each syringe contains only one dose , so use it wisely . - You don 't trust Bob , do you ? - Did he put you up to this ? I put me up to this . I wanna hear your side . Bob is morally grey , at best . And the virus ? He 's toying with a death sentence . You have the cure . No one dies . Just because he has a safety net doesn 't make it ethical . So you would make a different choice ? Morally un-grey ? I killed a lot of people , brutally ripped them in half . They could have given me the virus , but they didn 't . They 've made me right , so that I could have a life . Go home to my son . You 're never gonna have a life . You 're not cured . You 're a killer . And before this day is over you 're gonna kill everyone . - Niki ? - Go on . Tell him what you 're seeing . He 'll think you 've gone crazy again . And then you 'll never see Micah . Is everything all right ? Let 's go . I know these other families . Linderman , Nakamura , Pratt , Deveaux . Everyone who 's been killed . I don 't know this one . Who is he ? Who 's Adam Monroe ? - Adam is ... complicated . - So un-complicate it . Adam convinced us that we belonged together . That we could make the world a better place for our children ... for you . " Snow falls on Miami " . - I don 't get it . - That headline could have read " Tsunami wipes out eastern seaboard " . What does any of this have to do with the murders ? - Adam 's the one trying to kill us . - I thought Maury Parkman was ... Maury 's the weapon , the blunt instrument . Adam was the visionary . With these abilities , sometimes people tend to think of themselves as gods . Did you ever think that , Nathan ? Adam did . And he began to talk about holocausts , plagues . Punishing humanity in order to save the world . - Sounds a lot like Linderman . - Linderman was Adam 's disciple . Adam was dangerous . So we locked him up . We threw away the key . Two weeks ago he escapes , and now he wants revenge . It sounds like you 're reaping what you sow . - Why should I care ? - Because of Peter . Listen , pal , you wanna talk about my brother , you better be very careful what you say next . Peter is alive , Nathan . Your brother is alive . I 'll leave you two alone . Do I know you ? They brought me here to help you , Peter . - You need to remember who you are . - I need to find Caitlin . You need to focus . You can move objects with your mind , heal , you can paint the future . - How do you know about that ? - You absorb abilities from others . You are the most powerful of us all . You 're a kind and caring soul . Selfless . Always thinking about others . But now you need to think about yourself and fly into the face of danger . - Just like your brother . - I have a brother ? He died in the first outbreak . But you ... You can change that . How ? I was in Montreal in 2007 . The next thing I know , I 'm here . You met a man named Hiro Nakamura . He can travel in time . So can you . - You can change history . You must ! - I can 't . I can 't control these things that are happening to me ! Then this virus will kill us all . Peter , you need to remember . You need to remember . Mom ? Do the marks hurt ? No . They 're kinda just there . Painless souvenirs of my alien abduction from the guy with horn-rimmed glasses . If you 're gonna be dropping in , there 's something I need to tell you . - I get it . - Get what ? I 'm moving too fast . We don 't have to go any further if you don 't want to . You know what I want ? Popsicles . Popsicles . Awesome . Raspberry or blue ? - He found us . - Who ? The man who abducted me . We 've gotta get outta here . - Come on . - No , wait . I 've been trying to tell you . The guy in the glasses is my father . What is this ? Some sort of trap ? - No , just listen to me . - Back off . - Wait . - Claire ! - Who are you talkin ' to ? - No one . You 've got two popsicles . Welcome home . All this trouble over one drop of liquid . - This could kill an entire species . - Or stop Maury and save our lives . Poor Niki . So vulnerable . You 're perfect . Show me your nightmares . Show me your thoughts , your soul . How do I turn you into a killer ? Nothing 's going to save you . This company is bad . You 're not making up for your sins . You 're diggin ' deeper into hell . Worse , you 're gonna drag Micah down . You 're wrong . They said that they would help me . - Niki , what are you talkin ' about ? - I was sick . I 'm still sick . - How can you say that ? - Because you 're dead . No , I 'm not . They don 't want me talkin ' to you . They 're using you , Nik . Just like Linderman . Just like Jessica . You can still do the right thing . You have to kill him . That 's the only way you can save Micah . Niki , you 're talking to yourself . I think it 's Maury . We need to call Bob . This many guns in Japan , they will crush history . I cannot let White Beard win . We can still stop this ... together . We did make a good team , you and I. You showed me how to be a hero . How to love . And then ... you took it all away . Do it , Hiro . Stop time . Kill me . Cut off my head . I will not do it . I still have faith in you . The honourable Hiro Nakamura . He won 't kill you . He 'll just lie and steal . I wanted to help you become a hero . I never claimed to be anything more than a happy drunk . Do not punish the world for my mistakes ! I only want to punish you , Hiro . Yaeko was right . She 's not destined to be my princess . She 's destined to die . - No ! - Ah ! Take my hand . We must get out of here now . As long as I have breath , anything you love , I will lay to waste . I swear . Peter 's alive , Nathan . This was taken three months ago right here . - Is he here now ? - No . He 's gone . Gone where ? What is it you 're not telling me ? I need to know everything . He was in Cork , Ireland , and then we lost track of him . Lost track of him ? How do you lose someone ? How do you lose someone ? Dad ! Matt ! Molly . What are you doing in here ? Where are we ? - This is where he keeps me . - What ? When I tried to find your dad , he locked me in here . - Now we 're both trapped . - No . No , we 're not . Dad ! Dad ! Matt ? - Did you bring me here ? - I think ... I think I did . - Stay back , Nathan . - I got it . Don 't do it . This isn 't you . Don 't do it . - How can you defend him ? He killed D.L. - Didn 't kill anyone . It 's Maury . - He 's inside of your head . - This is a nightmare . This isn 't you . Don 't be his puppet ! You 're stronger . You came to get control of your life . Don 't let Maury undo all of that . Listen to me . Listen to me . Think of your son . Think of Micah . Think of your boy . I couldn 't get the nightmare out . I didn 't know what else to do . I had to stop myself . - Matt . - Don 't be scared . We 're gonna get out . - Do you recognise this room ? - Yeah , of course . This is our old place on Parthenia . Brisket and potatoes . The night you left . - I never apologised . - You weren 't sorry . You walked out , never turned back . You think this didn 't hurt me ? This broke my heart . I love you , Matt . - Then turn yourself in . - That 's not gonna happen . - No prison can hold me . - I think there is ! I think I can trap you in here like you trapped Molly . - How are you gonna do that ? - This isn 't my nightmare ! This is yours ! I can walk right out that door . - No , you can 't . - I have to . Come on . You can 't ! You 're not strong enough ! You 're still that scared little boy ! No ! I 'm not scared of you anymore ! I 'm a good man ! I 'm a good cop ! I 'm a good father , something you know nothing about . You don 't know what it 's like to fight for someone you love . You left . You left . All you have are your nightmares . - Let 's get out of here . - Don 't leave me . Don 't leave me alone ! No ! No ! - Matt ? - Oh , God . The nightmare 's over . He 's never gonna hurt you again . Ever . I promise . - Oh , God , I love you . - I heard . So what happens next ? Where do all these people go ? Same place we are , home . - Peter ! Peter ! - Caitlin ! I 'm scared ! Don 't let them take me away from you . - I 'll get us home . I promise . - Please . Don 't let them take me . No . No ! No ! Caitlin ! Antibodies in my blood 'II eradicate any trace of the virus . Your nose , does it hurt ? Only when I breathe . - I 'm sorry . - It 's not your fault . You weren 't in control . This can 't be right . - What 's wrong ? - The antibodies aren 't working . This isn 't possible . Not now . It 's another strain of the virus . It 's immune . My blood 's no longer a cure . I 'm going to die ? Hiro ! This strain has no cure . Are you certain of these results ? We 'll keep Maury sedated . We 'll destroy every last vial . I promise . What is this ? It 's a chance to save Niki . We got a police report . A girl walks away from a 50-foot fall without a scratch . - Cellular regeneration ? - Her name is Claire Bennet . You remember her father , Noah ? He worked for us . Of course . He 's not exactly gonna let us take his daughter , is he ? - Are you saying we should kill him ? - I 'm saying we should be prepared . This is Ivan Spektor . Our man in the Ukraine . He was Bennet 's friend , his mentor . Bennet killed him . - When was this ? - Last night . Are you sure it was him ? He left fingerprints . Bennet is getting sloppy , emotional , and that means dangerous . I have something I need to tell you . I have been working with Bennet to take down this company . Why are you telling me this now ? Because ... I am unsure of who 's right and who 's wrong . And it is time to stop playing games . There 's a storm coming , Dr Suresh . Claire is the key . Her regenerative abilities , they could cure the virus . - She could save Niki . - I want to do the right thing here . For Niki . For everyone . - So did you meet him ? - Meet who ? The boyfriend , West . He was here today . - Claire has a boyfriend ? - I checked him out , he 's fine . You cannot be the only man in her life forever . No , I suppose not . We knew this day would come . You wanna tell me about this ? - It 's nothing . - Nothing . " Cheerleader claims she saw her team-mate fall 50 feet to her death " . That 's nothing . I asked you to do one thing , Claire . I asked you to keep your nose clean . Debbie was drunk . Nobody believes her . Did your boyfriend make you do this ? - Are you kidding me ? - Answer me . It 's none of your business ! Your tiny rebellions are putting this family in danger ! Me ? What about you , Dad ? Think any of us really believe you were out at a copy conference ? Where were you , out abducting people ? - What is going on down here ? - What did Claire do this time ? - Shut up , Lyle ! - It 's not safe here anymore . - Pack your bags . We 're moving . - You can 't do that . This is not a discussion . - We 're leaving . - Then you 're going without me . Adam . Adam . I don 't know any Adam . Peter , what the hell was that ? - Do you know me ? - Of course I know you . It 's me , Adam . Don 't you remember ? You and I are going to change history .

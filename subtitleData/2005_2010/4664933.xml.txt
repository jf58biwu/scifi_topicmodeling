 258 ) \ be1 } Stop Something wasn 't right . that 's how I felt . There was a match between two teams that I had never heard of before on TV I felt compelled to cheer for the losing team . I had the feeling that Haruhi was about to cause a commotion again . What in the world ... the phone . You don 't have to tell me . I know . right ? We 're all meeting in front of the station at exactly 2 o 'clock . Make sure you come ! I didn 't even get to say a thing . What ? I forgot to tell you what to bring . Bring your swimming gear and lots of money ! And make sure you come on a bike . Over ! I had the feeling that I knew exactly what Haruhi was going to say . that 's not right . it felt like the same thing happened not too long ago . déjà vu ? huh . 225 ) } En 202 ) } dl 225 ) } ess 365 ) } Ei 397 ) } gh 390 ) } t Kyon ! You need to show more enthusiasm ! yeah . Sorry for making you guys wait . let 's go ! Where to ? of course ! so I guess we would . we should have summer activities like what people do in the summer ! you know ? That 's why we 're doing this now ! check timing between this line and the next } we 're going to the pool by bike . You guys brought yours too ? you and I are the only ones who brought bikes . Kyon ? You can 't lose to Koizumi-kun . take off ! Charge ! you two ! Kyon ! We came here to have fun ! Why 're you acting so worn out already ? Too many people ! Just whose fault do you think that is ? Whose ? ! the smell of chlorine ! This is what it 's all about ! let 's find a place to put our bags and go swim ! It 's a race ! A race ! Mikuru-chan ~ Hurry up and get in ! The water is nice and warm ! Can 't she read the signs that say " No Diving " ? these next few lines seem to start a little late / the previous line end a little late } isn 't it ? { Nazo : based off of TLC since Ky messed up this line I think . Need to check with him } And really peaceful too . Don 't you think Suzumiya-san may have found a normal way of enjoying things ? Is inviting people by calling them up all of a sudden and then hanging up after stating her one-sided demands ... { Nazo edit : went from " them " to " me " so I just dropped the " me " } considered " normal " ? From my perspective something that minor isn 't a big deal at all . there shouldn 't be anything happening that will endanger the world . If only that were true ... What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's probably just my imagination . We 've been through a lot since spring . I think I might have become a little neurotic . Here you go . Thank you . It tastes good . Come on ! Let 's go in the pool again ! this should be a " pool for the masses " instead of a " pool for the public " . Why would Haruhi choose a place like this ? It 's this feeling again . I have the feeling that I 've seen this scene somewhere before . Nagato seems to be bored . Kyon ! That 's right . Then Haruhi said something like ... These two are my brigade members . They will listen to whatever I say . So ask them anything ! Now let 's go have fun ! We 're going to play water soccer . okay . I guess déjà vu happens all the time . Mikuru-chan ! but ... What do you think ? What 's this ? It 's our plan for how to pass what little remains of summer vacation ! When I suddenly realized that there were only two weeks of summer vacation left I was horrified ! It just feels like there 's still so much to do . we don 't have any time left . we 're going all out ! { Nazo : Minor reword } We 're doing all of this in less than 2 weeks ... do you have anything you want to do ? I would like to scoop up goldfish . Okay . Goldfish ... scooping . Excuse me . Thanks . I wonder if there 's an Obon festival being held near here . I 'll look into it . then . We 're starting tomorrow ! You 're dismissed for today ! Nagato ! but ... How have you been feeling lately ? Been doing fine ? I 'm fine . Th-That 's great . Yes . Why ... Why did I call out to her ? You can go if you want . from Haruhi . Apparently they had found the location of an Obon festival . Let 's all go buy yukatas together ! Mikuru-chan and Yuki said they don 't have one . And neither do I. so we 'll go for those ! Haruhi led us into a women 's bulk clothing store and then briskly proceeded to drag them into the changing rooms . After making us wait for nearly an hour - Woah ! So dazzling ! You girls look great . after all . Especially Mikuru-chan ! You 're so cute ! Just what I 'd expect from myself ! Y-Yes ! WOOOOOH ! Mikuru-chan ! Let 's scoop non-stop ! huh ? There 's quite a crowd here . but ... I feel like I 've been here recently . That stage ... That food stall ... Shall we do the same ? How about a competition ? Watch me go ! Forget about it . do you want to get something to eat ? You 're interested in these things ? Which one ? { Nazo edit : shortened to fit timing } It 's fine . This one . Sure ! That 'll be 800 yen . but ... We got a big catch today ! Thirteen fish ! I just took one . And one for Mikuru-chan too . I 'll let you have it . Thanks . what 's with the mask ? I bought it . Oh ... really . Right ! Fireworks are next ! We 'll finish today off with that ! Haven 't you ever heard of the saying " Don 't bite off more than you can chew ? you get summer vacation . but there was one thing bothering me . We 'll go bug catching tomorrow . but have you finished your homework ? What 's with you ? You can do all of that in three days . Three days ? ! then knock yourself out with fun . That 's the right way to enjoy summer vacation ! Why the hell is this girl so smart ? The distribution of attribute points is pretty random . we 're going bug catching tomorrow ! The one who catches the most bugs will ... Let 's see get to be the Brigade Leader for the day ! thanks . That sounds like fun . Will any bug do ? umm ... Cicadas only ! That 's right . It 'll be the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition ! The next day was ridiculously nice . we held the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition . but ... the winner was Haruhi . We should go with a " catch-and-release " mentality after all . they might return the favor in the future . What can a cicada do for us exactly ? I felt like I was Pandora . W-Welcome ! we were gathered for some random reason given a bunch of random frog costumes to wear and ended up handing out balloons in front of a supermarket as a part-time job . I feel like I 've just been released from the Adzam 's " leader " weapon ... TL Note : The MAX-03 Adzam is a mobile armor that saw action at Odessa during the One Year War ( Mobile Suit Gundam ) . everyone ! What 's with that cheerfulness of hers ? Good job ! The manager was really grateful ! I don 't need the old man 's gratitude . Where 's our pay ? This is it . What ? I 've wanted this for a while now ! He said he 'd give it to us because of Mikuru-chan ! You made us do all that work just for the sake of getting that ? ! Let 's decorate the clubroom with it in commeration ! just wear it whenever you feel like it . I give you permission ! That night . stolen by none other than a phone call . Kyon-kun ... Asahina-san ? it 's me . If this goes on ... I 'll ... Um - Koizumi . Why are you together with Asahina-san at this hour ? A slight problem has occurred . Do you think you could come right now ? Asahina-san ? Kyon-kun ... I ... can 't go back to the future ! it 's like this . We are currently looping through the same time over and over again . you said that quite cheerfully . do you have any idea what you 're saying ? I do . There 's nothing more to it . I was talking to Asahina-san just now . Call me for a meeting too ! I happened to notice that the flow of time lately has felt strange . I guess you can say Asahina-san was the one that discovered it . I was able to confirm something . Confirm what ? since it sounds weird . } You told me that already . it 's from August 17th to August 31st . We 're caged up in an endless summer vacation . It certainly is summer vacation now . endless summer . The world now has lost all its time after September 1st . That 's the reason why Asahina-san is unable to return to the future . I guess it 's only natural . What part of physics argues that a state of " no future " is natural ? Who the hell would believe that ? would believe it . I 'll give you an explanation too ... I always use * classified information * to communicate with the future and usually do * classified information * . so it was strange . That 's what I thought ... And then * classified information * . so I did a * classified information * but it was completely * classified information * . What do I ... I don 't know what to do either ... Was she just using the term " classified information " as a replacement for censoring words ? Are we inside something similar to an enclosed space ? that 's not the case . One part of the time continuum has just been cut off . everything will be reset at exactly 2400 hours and we will return to August 17th again . That 's the process . the whole human race 's memories ? gets reset . Everything starts over from the beginning again . it sounded weird . Maybe should check with Ky really ... } since people from the future are involved in this . Nope . This one has nothing to do with Asahina-san . Then what 's the reason ? Probably Suzumiya-san . She might be unaware of it herself but there might be a part of her that thinks : " I don 't want summer to end ! What the hell ? Does she have some sort of regret ? I believe so . It may very well be the fact that she feels like she still has something to do during the summer . Way to go . meaningless issue into galactic proportions . So what do you want me to do ? I would have already resolved it . but ... You look like you 're having fun . aren 't you ? Now that I think about it I 've finally managed to solve the riddle of the déjà vu being left as imprints from past loops . I 've come to understand that the imprints are the remains of a memory reset . Don 't tell me everyone in the world feels it too . It doesn 't seem like it . You and I are special cases . Just by being people who are close to Suzumiya-san we become the only people capable of feeling this . What about Haruhi ? Isn 't she at least aware of this herself ? It doesn 't look like it at all . though . I 'm thinking that there must be someone who has retained all of his or her memories of the repeated time . And who would that be ? I think you 'll know without me having to say it . It 's Nagato-san . being outside the constraints of space and time would most likely know the most . Is this true ? Yes . Do you remember everything ? Yes . how many times have we been " reset ? and twenty-fourth time . 524 ? 524 ? Nagato ? Are you serious ? Yes . So we did the same things over and over again each and every one of those times ? That is not necessarily the case . double check how this + next sentence sounds } 391 in which we did not go to the Obon festival . we went twice . Obon minus the goldfish catching occurred 437 times . Part time work has been conducted a total of ... that 's enough . 524th time . That 's what she said . about 595 years . living it over and over again while retaining her memories ? just how does it feel to have lived through all this ? I 'm thinking about ridiculous things again ... The next day was stargazing . The venue was Nagato 's apartment . Koizumi prepared the telescope . this is boring . Let 's look for UFOs ! anyway ? I wonder . Why don 't we try this out for starters ? Suddenly hug Suzumiya-san from behind and whisper into her ear : " I love you . And who 's doing that ? I wonder if there 's anyone more suitable than you . I was waiting for you to say that ... you think I want to ? ! Shall I do it instead then ? I 'm kidding . we went to the batting center . Nagato . Even before you talked to Asahina-san right ? Yes . Why did you keep quiet about it ? My mission is to observe . I did it ! I win again ! One more time ! we 've pretty much completed our summer plans . I wonder if it 's okay like this ? But ... I guess that 's it . do any of you want to do anything else ? fine then . so it 's probably enough . it 's not . You aren 't supposed to be satisfied yet . let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . just take a good rest until then . Let 's meet in the clubroom the day after tomorrow . Haruhi ! It 's this feeling again . Déjà vu ! It 's never been this strong before . I can 't let Haruhi go home like this . all those ten thousand something weeks will just end up being repeated again ! But what should I do ? What should I say ? What did she say up until now ? I don 't know . I can 't remember ... August 31st . Homework : unfinished . check timing here } happens . If everything really repeats again then doing this homework would be meaningless . I 'll just leave it to myself to figure it out then .

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... So you know . It 's MacPherson . I 'm right . Yes , I 'm afraid you are . And he now has a sword which renders him invisible . Now it 's up to you to stop him . You always hurt the one you love . Artie ! No ! No , no ! Okay , just stop . Okay ? Stop and think this through . Uh , guess what ? I 'm still taking the artifact . I can 't let you do that , Pete . Turn around . No , MacPherson is alive . And he 's loose somewhere in the world . Stopping MacPherson is not your job . My what ? Protecting the world happens to be my job , and right now , that is being threatened by an insane ex-Warehouse agent who is competing for artifacts that belong right out there . Mrs. Frederic said that she would handle it . I can do it . Artie , he ran a sword through your chest . I 'm all right . You could have died . Please , just let Mrs. Frederic handle it , okay ? This ... This is your job , Artie , and you 're not doing it . You have Pete , Myka and Claudia spread out through the Warehouse taking inventory for you day after day . Meanwhile , all of ... Yeah , all these things are piling up . Yes , they are . All right . Hey , hey , hey , hey . I 'm pretty hard to kill . Pete ? Yeah Really What 's all this ? Pete ? Nice one . Did not see that coming . Hey . Playing with yourself again ? One game . A quickie . We got time . Besides , none of this stuff 's going anywhere . Right , buddy ? Okay , this stuff is dangerous , all right ? All right . This is Lewis Carroll 's mirror . Alice in Wonderland , " Off with their heads . " That 's chick lit right ? Chick lit . Right . I mean , come on , not everything in here is dangerous . You got that cuddly , little ferret from a cooking pot . Yeah . He peed in my shoes . That was ... That was me . That 's funny . So , what , are you still mad at Artie ? No . No . I 'm not . I 'm not mad at Artie . No , I 'm mad at you . No , you 're not mad at me . Yes , I am . You 're not mad at me . You 're not mad at me , because when you 're mad at me , your neck gets all longer until you 're like that . It 's like a giraffe or whatever . And then when you 're mad at Artie , your neck gets all over here to the right . Yes . Just like that . Look , I know the MacPherson-DC thing is still bugging you , okay , but everybody has a past . But he lied , Pete . Artie 's past is treasonous , hazardous and , hey , there 's a crazy man who wants us dead and he wants the Warehouse all for himself . It would have been nice knowing that going in , Pete . Artie should have told us about MacPherson . Yes , yes , I get it . Daddy issues . Can 't deal with the old man . You 're an ... Oh , my God , the mirror . I got it ! Watch out ! Oh , wait ! Look , big , shiny thing . Pete ! Sick ! Let 's ... That sounds like ... The Studio 54 disco ball . God , I hate disco . Okay . Whoa ! Okay . Oh , God . Myka , are you okay ? Hey ! What 's going on ? Myka , are you okay ? What 's going on ? Huh ? Ask him . You can 't ... You can 't ... This is just ... I know you 're feeling lost . What ? Artie 's past , MacPherson . It can be a bit disorienting . I know . I feel pretty clear , actually . If things are the way they are , don 't fight it , just go with it . Whenever I don 't , I always end up right back in the same place , not a good one . Thank you for the tea . You 're welcome . Hi . Hey . I 'm gonna do it . I 'm doing it . I 'm doing it . Okay . Um ... They 're excellent , yeah . I don 't know what ... Ooh ! Mmm ! So , today 's ... Where is he ? Pete ? In the room , please . You do something different with your hair ? Mmm-mmm . Would you help me with this bag ? I don 't care about your high score , dude . Dude , take your meds . I want a turn , bro . I know . I know . I know . You saved at least ? I saved . Thank you . Focus . Focus . What are you doing here ? Focusing . No , no , no , no , no . You don 't ... We 're gonna ... We ... You ... All right , never mind . Fine . Just try ... Try to pay attention . Gary and Jillian Whitman , take one each , aka , more aliases than I even care to mention . They are small-time thieves who have inexplicably hit the big time . I smell artifacts . I smell a loser . - No . Come on . - Claudia . Claudia . Let 's let Artie get through this so we can just not be here any longer than necessary , all right ? Thank you very much , Myka . Much appreciated . You 're welcome . So , what is this , um ... What is this artifact ? I don 't know . It 's unconfirmed , but if there is one , it 's giving these two an unbelievable amount of luck , the kind that defies all the laws of probability . They 've had winning streaks in Miami , Detroit and Atlantic City and they 've not ... Not one single gaming commission alarm bell has been tripped . Well , how ? How ? Well , they go into a gaming room and it has high rollers ... Anybody ? Okay , fine . And , they 're really good . And they win just enough money to stay under the radar . Right ? And then they ... Fine . Then they move on , they don 't get caught . Okay , so they 're taking a little back from the house . OMG what 's the BFD What ? Yeah , iniquitous hands with the means to exploit fate . " Iniquitous " means " bad . " Thanks , Roget . So , where are they now ? Three hours ago , they checked into room 1510 at the Maximus Hotel in Las Vegas . So , I 've also prepared rundowns , this is yours , of possible artifacts that are still in the wild that might be responsible . And there 's also plane tickets and reservations for the Maximus and all that stuff . Vegas , baby . Kicking it ! Where 's the money ? Hmm ? Well , we need to roll high . Yeah , there 's $ 10,000 in Pete 's envelope . Oh , snap . Oh , yeah . Doubt it . Do you ... Are you sure this is enough ? Get out . Get out . Pack . Boys . Hey , hey , do me a favor . Yes , yes , yes , my liege , I shall bring you receipts . Yeah , that , too . But also one more thing . Is she mad at me ? No . Okay . Yes . Maybe . A little . But , look , a trip to Vegas will un-bunch the pants , and it should be fun . No , no , no , no . Please , don 't have fun . Yeah , or crap out . That 's so funny . Later . So , what am I doing ? What do you mean , " What are you doing ? " Well , Leena told me Mrs. F is keeping you off the MacPherson trail . So , I mean , it doesn 't mean I can 't look for him , probably ... I 'm only going to say this once , are you listening ? Yeah . Back off ! The man will kill you , kill you . Understood ? Yeah . Yes , sir . Why , hello . How are you ? Hi . All right . Va-va-voom ! Your tie 's crooked . Well , you just knocked everything crooked . How are my teeth ? Your teeth are fine . Perfume . That 's a first . Mmm-hmm . So , I 've been going over the possibles . I 've been sniffing 10 grand . Nothing in Artie 's hit list suggests a multi-part object , which means we 're looking for one thing , and it should be in their possession . Why ? Carson 's rule of linear transfer . It means they have to have it on them . Forced outcomes require tangency . Well , someone 's been paying attention . Mmm-hmm . Some of us longer than others . Okay , well , let 's assume that it is a single artifact shared by two suspects . Why don 't we each take one and we 'll compare notes ? Okay . I 'll take Lady Luck . You take her date . And I got these . I , uh ... What is it ? I cleaned them with alcohol , all right ? So ... And a little bit of spit . Kidding . Testing . Sorry . Ow ! Okay . Oh , you have the Tesla , right ? Yes . I 'll trade you for the Farnsworth . But you ... You have the gun . I know , but it 's the boring one . Well , you lost the toss . I know . Let 's just go find this artifact and see if we can 't change somebody 's luck . Okay , that thing is so freaky . What , this ? Yeah . No , the thing behind you . Yeah , that . Well , trapped desires refracted by light , sounds , sex , mind-altering drugs , into a disco ball . Disco ball . A disco ball . I know . I know . Dude , how ? Well , unknown , unknown , but mirrors are usually just gonna reflect light , but this thing projects yearnings and cravings . You know what this thing does ? It imparts the grim , stampeding inhumanity against anything decent . Don 't worry . Not in here . In here , it 's just a round , shiny object , but out there ... It 's the ' 80s ? The ' 70s . By the way , I 'm sorry I came down on you a little hard at Leena 's . You know , whatever . It 's just because I owe you , you know , for helping me and saving Joshua . I mean , the guy hurt you , you know . It pisses me off . Yeah , yeah . If finding MacPherson helps you ... Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay . Just ... Just help me lift this thing . We 'll do it on three . All right . Well , can Mrs. Frederic find him ? I don 't know . On three . One , two , three . Well , the guy used to work here though , right ? Yeah . And what , the place drove him nuts ? Something lured him to the dark side ? Yeah . No . He is the dark side , and things are lured to him , people especially , which is why you 're never going to mention his name ever again . Just to you ? To anyone . Promise me . Yes . Is that Myka ? Whatever it is , it 's not good . Red five . You 're pushing our luck . Yeah , and it 's pushing right back . Take a break . I 'm okay . We 've got enough , okay ? Nobody 's legs are getting broken . Everybody 's paid off . Well , college for five kids won 't be cheap . We 're having three . And it won 't matter if you 're not around for the honeymoon . Oh , I 'll be around . It 's going to be the best years of our lives . Just five more spins . Three . Okay , we found them . You see anything ? Besides two scoundrels in love ? No , but they might have something off-site . All right , I 'm going to go toss their room . Call me if you see them chewing on a rabbit 's foot or adjusting a magic girdle . Red 23 . - Careful ! - Stop yelling ! Start listening . I 'm so running over your toes . All right , just get it straight . Not like that ! Okay ! Could you close the door behind you ? Got it . You know what ? Pull all the Dodgson files , would you ? And pull anything that 's got a listed cross-reference like Alice Liddell , Lewis Carroll . What are you still standing here for ? I 'm not your girl Friday . What kept you ? Three pumpkin pies and a broken oven thermostat that you keep promising to fix . Um ... Yeah . What 's this ? Well , this is why I called you . Artie , what happened ? Yeah , optical divagation , I think . Wait , what ? Kind of like a retinal flare after a photo flash . My best guess is the blast from the disco ball , it kind of fritzed this mirror 's primary reflective capacity . And then , it probably clipped part of Myka 's psyche , infused it in there . I don 't know . You know , it 's kind of like shadows on a wall after Hiroshima . It 's a pretty lively shadow . Yes , but is it ? Is it what ? Alive . Uh-huh . You want to ? Sure . Uh , what 's that about ? I 'm going to pull her back if she falls in . Get your mind out ... Okay . Thanks . So ? Nothing . So , what is it , just a shadow play ? Well , the glass is like a barrier . If that 's alive , I can 't tell . Let 's just ask her . It . It . It might have something to tell us . I mean , why can 't we just talk to her ? Because we do not converse with reflected entities , okay ? Because ... Because two words , Bloody Mary . That 's just an urban legend , though , right ? Of course , it isn 't . Shadows have power , and you let this thing speak and there is no telling what could happen . Pete was playing ping-pong with one of those things . Weren 't you supposed to go pull files or something ? Thank you . Okay , oh , and pull anything from Studio 54 . Got it . 54 . Heard you . Can I make a suggestion ? Sure . I haven 't lost a penny , Mom . Is Myka with you ? No , she 's downstairs on the Whitmans . I 'm getting ready to search their room . What 's up ? Nothing . How 's your radar ? You mean am I having a vibe or something ? Yeah . Give it a second . Anything out of the ordinary ? Anything at all ? With Myka ? With anything . You know , now that you mention it , there is something . What ? The buffet is overpriced . Other than that . No . No vibe , no trouble . It 's all good . All right . Are you sure ? Artie , is there something I should know ? No , no , no , no , no . Everything 's good , it 's just a status check . Don 't dawdle , stay in touch , goodbye . " Kirk , out . " He 's fine , so is Myka . Okay ? Okay . Put it down on black 15 . Myka . Yes ? I got nothing . Yeah , nothing 's going on down here , either . They 're still winning and I 'll be damned if I know how . ... cons of the situation , I just don 't ... Yeah , I know . I have . I just think that that 's ... What if , maybe , we put those two together ? I don 't think that 's going to work . What about what we tried in ... What is that ? Oh , that 's just something I whipped up . Yeah . What do you mean ? Just now ? Yeah , that 's right . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . What ... What are you doing ? I 'm opening a line of communication . The CIA uses laser mikes to read vibrations off windows to hear what 's going on on the other side of the window , right ? Yeah . I want to hear what she has to say . Bloody Mary , shadows have power , I get it . But what if that 's not just a shadow , Artie ? Artie , that look on her face is somebody who 's trapped . Believe me , I know that look , and so do you . If things get hinky , you can pull the plug . What 've you got to lose , okay ? I do need to do this . Don 't ... I mean , just wait . I just ... Wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait . Let me think . Myka . Myka , where are you ? Oh . Hey . So , Mr. Whitman doesn 't look good . No sign of any artifact ? Not even a glimmer . What 's up with his hand ? I don 't know . Look , if you want to get some rest , I 'll stay with them . Not if they split up . If they do , I 'll call you . No , no , let 's stay together . If they 've got something , it 's on them . I want to know what it is . I 've been burned by this before . They look real and they 'll say anything . Say something . Artie , when I get out of here , I 'm hugging her and I 'm kicking your ass . Yeah , well , that won 't be happening . Why ? Artie , it 's me . No , no , you 're just a reflection . The real Myka 's in Las Vegas on a mission with Pete . What ? No , no , I 'm not . Artie . You see , that 's exactly what I mean . You just don 't do it . Turn that thing off . Artie , if I 'm in Vegas with Pete then how can I be here ? No , just don 't turn it off ! Whatever that thing is , it 's never getting out of here . Lewis Carroll 's Alice , you 're so sweet , so innocent , so not true . This woman was as mad as a hatter and Charles Dodgson , aka Lewis Carroll , was not writing books . He was chronicling this young woman 's descent into a sociopathic madness . All of his books , he didn 't write these books . These are Warehouse fabrications , brilliant fabrications , to hide the truth about that mirror . Here 's a report from Warehouse field agents . Yeah ? The mirror crossed paths with Alice Liddell . I bet it crossed paths . When ? Well , right before the murders . That 's terrifying . Yeah , and there 's no mention of where the mirror came from . Okay , well , where do any of these things come from ? Okay , but , Artie , these agents , they trapped her inside of the mirror . Yeah . Somehow her energy , her essence ... Even they weren 't sure how it happened . Wouldn 't it have been nice , Leena , if these Warehouse field agents had bothered to figure it out before she killed one of them ? Lot of loose ends here , okay ? So , I 'm not ... Hey , that is why , Claudia , taking inventory is so important ! So , what are we saying ? What are we saying ? Are we saying that just Myka 's image got melded with the crazy essence of Alice ? Yeah , yeah , that 's exactly what I 'm saying . Looks like Myka isn 't Myka . And if we give voice to that thing , it will trick us somehow to try to get out , and that is not going to happen . We 've done enough . No , we promised each other we 'd stop at $ 5 million . I 'm a lying , convicted thief , Gary . I 'm breaking the promise . No . We 're so close . We 're just a few thousand away . It won 't make any difference . You need to see a doctor . We don 't have any insurance . Please . We 'll be paying out of pocket . And I won 't go unless we offset what that 'll cost with an hour 's worth of betting . Listen to yourself . You listen . My hand can rot off . I 'm not going to any doctor . We should take it now . Take what ? Whatever it is they 've got , you know , force them to hand it over . Well , we 're not even sure ... One more round of betting and then I 'm cashing us out . You 're the boss . I was just trying to keep her distracted . We 're clear . I want him . Sorry ? You follow the girl . I 'll stay here and I 'll call you if he comes out . Are you sure ? Yeah . I can handle him if there 's trouble . All right . Okay . I 'II ... I 'll call you if I catch anything . Do that . Artie , I know you 're not as sure about this as you 're pretending . I 'm not pretending . You know when you hold a mirror up to a second mirror and you get that sort of reflected infinity thing ? Mmm-hmm . Well , what happens if that mirror is reflected in something like the Studio 54 disco ball ? Is it possible to get some kind of artifact interaction , something completely unexpected ? I don 't know . What if the disco ball goes off and someone is standing in front of Alice 's mirror ? Well , I think we know what happened . Do we really ? Could reflections switch places ? Could people ? She pulls to the right . Pardon ? It 's something I noticed a couple minutes ago . When Myka 's mad at me , she pulls to the right . She 's mad at you now , has been for about a week . So , is she ? Pulling ? To the right ? Red 23 ! Excuse me , miss . Hi , you dropped this . Keep it . Maybe you 'll get lucky . That 's what I 'm hoping . Red 21 ! Holy bananas ! Okay . Oh . Uh ... Okay . You are really mad at me . I feel sorry for you , actually . And why is that ? Because of all the things right in front of your face that you simply refuse to see . Like what ? Like me . Oh , well ... Yeah , well , I need to ask you a question that only the real Myka would know the answer to . You know what ? You 're wasting time , Artie , ' cause Pete 's in danger . Yeah , well , so are you , right ? In danger , if you 're really who you say you are . Okay . Okay , fine . Here 's what you and I both know , but we never talk about it . All right ? Mmm-hmm . That I don 't trust you . That I need you to tell me the truth and not treat me like some chess piece that you move around on a board that only you can see . That I am valuable . That I matter . And that I deserve to know everything I can about this world that you send me into every day so at least I have a fighting chance . You know , in spite of everything ... In spite of everything , I like you . I think you 're great . I want you to think the same of me . I screwed up . Honey , my key 's not working . Hi . Where 's him ? Him 's not here . What room you looking for ? My room . Who are you ? You 're cute . And you 're faking it . Never con a con artist . You had your chance to walk away . You won 't get another . Hey . Hey . Uh ... Pete with you ? No . Listen , I 'm a bit busy . Can I call you back ? Yeah . No , sure . Everything okay ? It will be as soon as I can get back to work . Okay . Oh , I 've got some bad news . Leena tells me that your ferret escaped and she 's been trying to call for it . She doesn 't know its name , I don 't even know if you finally did name that thing . Did you ? No . No , actually I never did . Just put some food out and it 'll come back . I got to go . Now , where were we ? Myka did name the ferret . She 's just not telling Pete the name . Why not ? Because she named it Pete . Yeah , it 's cute , but it 's so annoying . No , that 's good . I like that . You think that 's funny ? Huh ? Because if she thinks we know , she 'll kill him . Jillian , hi . The name 's Pete . Look , you 're in trouble and I 'm here to help . That chip that you have , the one that 's changed your luck ... Hey ! Let go or I 'll scream . Jillian , it 's hurting you , okay ? That is a contact wound . Wishing objects do that . This one seems to be a bit addictive and we both know that that 's bad , right ? So , you keep the money , but you give me the chip . No . Gary 's sick , too , isn 't he ? You got to stop while you 're ahead , Jillian . Trust me . Don 't make me use this . The Jubilee Grand , right ? The fire ? What are you going to do with it ? I am going to put this on a shelf and ignore it forever . Damn it ! Wow . I know . Now watch . Watch what ? That chip allows you to see the future . Damn it ! Are you all right ? Yes , thank you . Yeah , I can see the attraction . You have to tell him what 's going on , Artie . Well , he may have figured it out already . Seriously ? I mean , it 's Pete we 're talking about here . I can 't ... I can 't get a hold of him . I mean , his cell keeps going to voice mail . Alice has obviously got the Farnsworth , so ... Well , dude , he 's in a big hotel . There was this man at the bar one night bragging about how he miraculously survived the inferno . He said that this chip saved his life . And you stole it . That 's what we do . Pete Lattimer , white courtesy phone . Phone call for Pete Lattimer . Jillian , take the money and run , don 't walk , find a beach , never look back . I am going to go get your husband . Hold on . You 're not arresting us ? You 're letting us go ? What happens in Vegas , okay ? Just get out of here . It looks like you were telling the truth . Don 't hurt Jillian . Oh , Gary , do you know what ? Hurting is half the fun . You want to know what 's more fun ? The other half . Who are you ? You 've had your wishes , Gary . Now it 's my turn . And now I 'll know when they 're coming for me . And if I can see them , I can kill them . I bet you didn 't see that coming . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm fine . I had to use the Tesla . He 's dead . You killed him . Pete , what 's going on ? Change of plans . Pete ... What , do you think I 'm an idiot ? Don 't answer that . Just stop , okay ? Just put down the gun and let 's think this through . Okay . Guess what ? I 'm still taking the artifact . I can 't let you do that , Pete . Die trying to stop me , Alice . Oh , clever boy . What tipped you ? The real Myka would never kiss me . Never . Not if her life depended on it . Which is ... A shame . You 're a good kisser . So , Artie hasn 't figured this out yet ? No , not yet , but when he does , he 'll set the real Myka free and you will , poof , disappear . It doesn 't work that way , Pete . Meaning what ? Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in . Really ? And I am done with that . Oh . Well , I beg to freaking differ . Freak . I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance . Turn around . This is on you . You 're the one who set me free . Yeah ? Well , I 'm fixing that right now . Turn around . Oh , my ... I 'm never going back into that mirror . Do you hear me ? Never . And this , this is my ace . That 's it . Cash me out . " Curiouser and curiouser . " Artie , now ! Hey , Pete , help me . Artie , where is Myka ? Thank you . Yeah , you 're welcome . All right . Okay . Okay . Here , let 's get this . So , what now ? Now ... Now we move Alice to the dark vault . What 's the dark vault ? It 's better than the " Oy , Gevalt . " Yeah . No , the dark vault ... You 've never seen the dark vault ? Yeah . I 'm going to hazard a guess here , you 're never going to want to see the dark vault after we move that to the ... Okay , you get the ... No , you know what ? Let 's do this tomorrow , okay ? But , you know , we better secure it . You know , let 's move that trunk . When I say " let 's , " I mean you . Little known , but apropos fact , by the way , Steven Rubell , who was one of the co-founders of Studio 54 , he considered calling his club Wonderland . Wow . Oh , my God ! - Other side . - Hey , lady ! Okay . Yeah . Hey , let 's go . Hey , hey , my 10 grand . Right , about that . Well , Artie , you know , uh , last-minute Apache helicopter rides to the middle of nowhere , South Dakota , don 't come cheap . Okay , I know a guy with a Chinook . Would 've cost you about half if you would have called me . Well , I had to beat Alice here , didn 't I ? Hey , hey ! What 's going on Did it work ? Look who 's here . Oh , my God ! She 's back . Making breakfast , come on . Come on . - So , Myka , you said I was - What ? Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Is that ... Is part of that a Bell + Howell Spectroscope ? Surprise . I repurposed it . What ? Without asking me ? I 'm only going to say this once , are you listening ? Yeah . Back off ! Just do as you 're told , please . Vibe , it happens all the time . So why do you trust them ? Well , one time I didn 't and I should have . My dad was a fireman . He died that night in a house fire saving a couple kids . Apparently Martino and your partner were having an affair and he was married . Her history doesn 't bother you ? I read the press release of what went down in Denver . You 're a hero . Lives were saved . Lives were lost . Want to do a shot ? Sorry , I don 't drink . Sure you do . Do I know you ? I haven 't had a drop in five years . Probably ' cause you drank enough for a lifetime the night you killed me . It was an accident . It was an accident . I was 17 . It was prom night . I 'm so sorry . Lee ? Lee , what are you doing ? Lee . No . Lee , talk to me . Doc , I gotta ... I have to get away from her . Lee ! Lee ! Damn it ! We have a man down . C-Block , second tier . Stay back ! We 'll need a doctor down here right away ! Get out of the way . Yeah , we got a ... Yeah , we got a situation down here . We got to secure this ... You 're going to jail , missy ! Well , better safe than sorry , right ? What are you talking about ? Unexplained suicides up in Riverton . We are off to see the warden . You use soap on a rope ? Hey , I don 't judge your personal hygiene products , although you might want to invest into some moisturizers . You 're a little dry around the nose . You want to swap beauty tips ? Then we can talk about the hair that 's sprouting from your shoulders , your nose and your ears . Ow ! Or , you know , you could just tell me about the prison suicides . Well , let 's go with the suicides . Inventory . What a bone . Tycho Brahe 's snot pocket . Check . This place is falling apart . Venus de Milo 's arms . Rad . You know what ? I cannot work under these conditions . What you doing ? Re-building a carburetor . That 's funny . No , I mean , what 's the tune ? Something I 've been working on for my father . Oh . How old is your father ? No , I mean , that 's really good for you . Can I have the keys to the cherry picker ? Why ? And no , you can 't . I just want to fix this light bulb . It 's flickering . It 's really annoying . Just let it go , Claudia . You know , it 's just going to burn out and you 'll have me fix it later . Okay , here 's the thing . You know , these bulbs , they never burn out . They 're Shelby bulbs . They were invented by Adolphe Chaillet 108 years ago . So there 's no need ... What am I doing even talking to you ? I am busy . I will tighten the bulb later . Artie . Fine . I know you have a corner on the whole vibe thing , but this place is creepy . Well , maybe it just needs a woman 's touch . Agents Bering and Lattimer ? Sorry to keep you waiting . There 's a tropical storm headed this way and the preparations are endless . I 'm Corinne Huggins , the warden . I 'm not sure what the Secret Service 's interest is in all this , but I expect to be kept in the loop . Of course . Good . This way . Riverton hadn 't had a suicide in two years . Now , including Donaldson , we 've had four in the past month . His parole had just come through , right ? He had reconciled with his wife , he was looking forward to being with his family . Not a very high risk for suicide . None of them were . All four were model prisoners . Had anything new been brought in before the first suicide ? Furniture ? Art work ? Agent Lattimer , this is a maximum security facility , not a college dormitory . There 's been nothing new . No woman 's touch . Right . Of course . What about new inmates ? There 's been a freeze on intake . We 've been operating over capacity since before I took over . And when was that ? Just over a month ago , just before the first suicide . I bet she 's got some demonic tchotchke on her desk that she uses as a paperweight . Okay , I take back the " woman 's touch " comment . My predecessor had been here quite a few years . There hasn 't been much time to look at paint chips . You killed me , Bunny . As it is , we 've had to store his things in the anteroom closet until his estate is out of probate . Myka ? Okay , so this prisoner , Donaldson , didn 't leave a suicide note . Mind if I look through his stuff ? You killed me , Bunny . These are his personal effects . Cool , love that . - Ouroboros . - Huh ? It 's the snake . It 's a symbol of self-reflection and cyclicity . And the best Rush album since Roll the Bones . Snakes and Arrows rocks . Written by one of our inmates . His path to salvation . Creepy . Who 's John Hill ? Though we 're surrounded by concrete and razor wire , I can show you more freedom than the men who hold the keys . What 's he in for ? Killed his wife . A lot . Darkness has descended on this house . Death has returned to Riverton . And those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it . Dr. Cooper 's ready for y 'all . Regret has no place in your life . Your only salvation is here . Artie , if you won 't let me use the cherry picker , then how am I ... Hmm . No way . What every fashionable girl is wearing this fall . Awesome . Suck it , Magneto . Sweet . I can totally see my house from here . Okay . This is mildly disconcerting . Great . Now we know they last 108 years . And do you think freaky cult leaders are born with crazy eyes , or is it some sort of corrective surgery ? Pete , what is it ? You don 't see that ? See what ? That guy standing there . It 's my dad . So , Pete saw his father , but you didn 't , right ? Yeah , but I should probably mention that I saw Sam earlier . What ? Why didn 't you say anything ? Well , you know , Sam 's dead and your father 's dead . I mean , you can understand my reticence , right ? You 're both hallucinating ? And when were you gonna mention that to me ? Well , we just did . What was that ? Tropical Storm Inez . Uh , you didn 't say that there was a storm . Why is that important ? How many times do I have to tell you about electrical energy ? It can crank up the intensity of an artifact , I don 't know , tenfold . And if an artifact is causing these hallucinations , then a powerful electrical charge can make these visions seem absolutely real . Well , they seem pretty real now . All right , then , listen . You 're gonna have to stay in constant contact . You got that ? Constant . I don 't care if you have nothing to report , every hour you 're going to call me , all right ? And meanwhile , you 're going to find out everything about these inmates who killed themselves . Start with the last one , Lee Donaldson . According to your statement , Lee said something before he jumped . " I have to get away from her . " That 's what he said . I can only think he meant Claire . That 's the girl he killed in the hit and run , right ? He quit drinking , but never forgave himself for taking a life . Well , guilt 's a powerful thing . He was your trustee , right ? More than that . We were friends . I 'm trained in recognizing the warning signs . I don 't know why I didn 't see them . Did Lee have any enemies ? John Hill , Riverton 's self-proclaimed messiah , leading his personal religious cult . Lee was an early convert , but after Hill started capitalizing on the suicides , Lee saw what he really was , an opportunist , preying on fear . Lee got out , and Hill didn 't like losing one of his lambs . Hill may have strange religious beliefs , but he 's harmless . I don 't particularly like what he has to say , but you can 't deny the calming effect it 's had on some of the inmates . How are we today , Mr. Hill ? Another day above ground , Warden . Another day above ground . Indeed . These are agents Bering and Lattimer . They 'd like to ask you some questions . All right . I 'll be in my office . Where 'd you get that necklace ? Well , you could say it 's always been with me . Or you could say where you got it . The object itself is of no importance . Its value lies in what it represents . And what is that ? Some demand that we consume ourselves with remorse for our supposed sin . Ouroboros reminds us to transcend the cycle , and walk the path to enlightenment . No remorse , huh ? What about the path to parole ? I was and am his instrument on Earth , and with my hands , it is his will and not mine that is done . To feel remorse is to shame God . What about those who are remorseful ? Like Donaldson . Lee 's death revealed his greater purpose . A man cannot be saved without sacrifice . Oh , I see . Well , that 's a neat trick , huh ? Now you get to tell your boys you can protect them from sacrifice , like Donaldson . My followers are free because they know the way to freedom . You killed me , Bunny . The cruelest prison is the one that we build for ourselves out of fear and regret . I 'm done . Sam ? This isn 't real . This can 't be real . Hey . Sam again ? Yeah . I can 't move . Okay , no . No need to panic , just take off the coat . Can 't take off the coat . Okay , new plan . I 'm so getting grounded . Incoming ! Better you than me . Ow ! Artie ! This is the last one . What is it you 're looking for ? I 'm not sure . Anomalies , patterns . Riots . Well , that 's a little specific , but sure . Sure . No . No , look . For decades , Riverton was known as " the Snake Pit . " Dozens of inmates went insane here . Then in 1979 , during Hurricane David , there were uncontrollable riots . I mean , the place almost burned down . Six months later , it was closed . Reopened a year later under Warden Matthews . He was here until he died last month . So what did he do differently ? Warden ? You okay ? I beg your pardon . The week is catching up with me . I was just asking what Matthews did differently to whip this place into shape . Well , he was very religious . He instituted daily prayers . He swore it turned the place around . That 's him . Hmm . Hey , hey , hey . This looks familiar . Check out what he got rid of when he moved in . And no more riots . He wasn 't a very tolerant man . Anything he thought was pagan he had taken out . Well , let 's go see the good reverend . Goodbye , snakes and arrows . And that should take care of that . Warden , I had your permission to wear that . I 'm not sure I understand . What exactly is the danger ? I 'm sorry . We can 't disclose that information . Well , I was quite clear , you get free reign of my institution , I get some answers . Please don 't misconstrue our silence as disrespect . It 's just beyond our authority to tell you . Yeah , but I 'm pretty sure there won 't be any more suicides . Cause of death , brain hemorrhage due to blunt force trauma . Final report to come . You could have helped me , Doctor . Lee , I 'm sorry . I tried , I did . I thought you were my friend . You ignored the warning signs . You let me die , Doctor . Stop , Lee ! Lee , I 'm your friend ! You killed me , Doctor . Listen to me ! You told me the suicides would stop . Now we have another one . Clearly , you 're not able to help , and you 're not being truthful with me about what 's going on . I promise you , Warden , we have told you everything that we know . Oh , really ? And what exactly are you looking for ? Well , it could be anything . Look , sometimes freaky stuff causes other freaky stuff to happen . After the storm passes , I expect you two to be gone . I 'm going to request a federal team of investigators . Okay , so he was here alone and he was depressed about Donaldson . Medical examiners record their autopsy findings . Maybe he has a recorder around here somewhere . Right . So look for one . Well ... Fine , I 'll do it . Well , I 'm over here . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . Okay . God . Sorry , I just want to lift your ... Hey , Myka . Okay , play it . Lee , I 'm sorry . I tried , I did . Lee , I 'm sorry . You 're my friend ! Okay , okay , so now he 's talking to the dead guy , but he should know better . He 's a doctor . What 's that static sound ? Did you hear that ? Yeah . Play it again . Okay . Lee , I 'm sorry . I tried , I did . Lee , I 'm sorry . You 're my friend ! Did you hear that ? Yeah , it sounded like , I don 't know , bad cell phone service . That 's 10,000 cycles per second . It could be the electrical interference that any natural material makes when it vibrates . Okay , so where does it come from ? Well , any number of minerals or heavy metals , or it could be an artifact that contains both . But just give me a second , just one ... Ah ! Uh ... Yeah , okay , does that sound familiar ? That 's it . So , Artie , we 're looking for some kind of a mineral artifact that causes hallucinations . Is that banging ? Do you hear a ... Yeah , no ... You do that , you do that . But I ... Artie Hello ? What ... No , I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I just ... You know what ? Artie , we got it . Thanks . We 'll call you later . Yeah , all right . S-O ... SOS ? Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia ! Artie ! Hi , Artie . Hi . Huh . Funny story . So I kind of tried to fix this light bulb , even though you expressly told me not to . And , man , have I learned my lesson . You were so right about this place . You just never know what to expect . Okay , you 're pissed . Can we move past that part for now , and get to the part where you get me down from here ? That wouldn 't be Volta 's lab coat that you 're wearing ? All part of the hilarious story I should really tell you when I 'm back on planet Earth . The reason , Claudia , that Volta 's lab coat is in the Warehouse is because Volta couldn 't control its magnetic field , as you may have noticed . Each metallic object that it connects to makes the coat stronger and stronger . That explains so much . Thank you . My glasses . Those better not be scratched ! You know , when I was in Girl Scouts , we would make these little mini-metal detectors so we could hunt for gold . Most speakers are coated with a polymer film that picks up VHF frequencies , but we never found any gold , but we did find a lot of worthless minerals . Uh-huh . Mmm-hmm . Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . I want you to know that you can tell me things . I got the report about Denver . What did it say ? I don 't know , I didn 't read it . Intellectually , I know I did everything by the book . Of course you did . You 're you . What if I missed something , Pete ? What if it 's my fault ? Myka , the only person responsible for Sam 's death is the piece of garbage that pulled the trigger that day . You protected the President . That 's the gig . You 're a hero and so is Sam . Okay ? Yeah . Okay ? Mmm-hmm . That 's a cool-ass science project . Yeah , it 's ... You know , it 's ... It 's not working . Sounds like it 's working . No , it 's not . It 's just crackling at everything . Well , maybe there 's minerals everywhere . Well , there can 't ... How can there be ... Minerals . The miners ... Mine ! They are everywhere , including in the ground . Come on . Thank you . I 'm sorry about the ... Look . Quartz mines . Quartz . Do you see ? This building was built on an old quartz mine . And back then , indigenous materials would have been used when building a new structure . Quartz as in the mineral ? As in hallucination-inducer . As in this whole freaking structure is one giant tuning fork and mother nature 's just banging away . Okay , now I 've got these magnets . They 're attached to this thing . When I let go , they 're coming right at you . They 'll stick to you and the stuff near you . Okay , here they come ! Ow ! Okay , they 're on . Would it have killed you to put a warning label on this thing ? Saying what , " Only put on in case of stupid " ? Ugh . Just bottom-line this for me , Artie . Worst-case scenario ? Oh , why not ? The entire warehouse buckles in on itself , crushing us both to death . Okay , yeah , I changed my mind . Sugar-coat it . Okay , it must be the storm , because I can 't get any reception . Okay , so the whole building is causing hallucinations , right ? Right . So , maybe we should start thinking about what stopped them for 30 years . Okay , so the prison opens . Right . There 's a hurricane , suddenly there 's a ton of violence , the prison closes , it reopens with a new warden and suddenly the violence stops . Right . He dies . Uh-huh . His stuff goes into storage . Uh-huh . The suicides start . Mmm-hmm . I don 't know . Maybe the old Bible-banger had something that was curing the crazy . Right . Maybe this is what Mrs. Frederic meant by endless freaking wonder . Let 's go . Yeah , let 's get ... Yeah , let 's get out of here ' cause it 's ... Warden ? Warden Huggins ! Go ! Warden , what 's wrong ? It 's locked . Have you got the keys ? Stop . Stop . I 'm sorry ! Okay , he 's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs . Warden Huggins , this is Agent Bering . Are you all right ? Get back , Dr. Cooper ! No , that 's not true ! Look out . Let me bust the door down . But it 's ... It 's ... Ready ? One , two , three . It 's a warden 's door . It 's probably sturdier than most . Well , I wish you would have said that about five seconds ago . No . Get away from me ! That 's not a good sign . We have to go through the ex-warden 's stuff in storage . You can 't keep us out , Corinne . You 'll never control this prison . How many more have to die by your hand ? I mean , how much " World 's Greatest Warden " crap can you have ? We don 't even know what we 're looking for . Why would this time be any different ? Okay , look , give me the Farnsworth . I 'm going to try Artie again . Don 't let the vision of demons fool you , brothers . It appears that Riverton is now the land of the blind , and we are its one-eyed kings . Just a minute . Yeah ? Artie . Artie , thank God . Okay , what shuts down quartz ? Of course it 's quartz . It 's quartz , right . Yeah , that makes perfect sense . I should have known . Quartz . Artie ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay , listen . Um ... Pierre Curie , his brother Jacques , they proved the existence of a converse effect of piezoelectricity . You know what that is , don 't you ? Yeah . Yeah . So , what you 've got to do is you ... Artie ! Yeah , sorry . Yeah . Okay , the frequency of a piece of quartz can be completely canceled out by its proximity to a second piece of quartz . Now the second piece is probably what the artifact ... I 'm having a little ... The image is breaking up . It 's a large piece , okay ? Is the storm ... worse ? A lot . When you find the artifact , you got to put it exactly ... Exactly ... before proximity ... the original frequency essential ... Artie ! Artie ! Okay , big piece of quartz in the closet . Hey , hello . Can we get back to me , Artie ? There 's a bicycle on me . We 're going to have to reduce the magnetic field , but we 're going to do it very gradually . And we have to do that just because we wouldn 't want to destroy your central nervous system . No . No , we wouldn 't . We would not . Hey , what is that ? That sounds bad . What is that ? Artie ! Artie ! Box of crap . Box of crap . Warden , whatever you 're seeing , it 's not real . You 're perfectly safe . It 's the cross . Uh ... Claudia , new plan . But , listen , you have to do exactly , exactly as I say . Got that ? You 're the man ! Stay right there . What ? Bingo . You found it ? What is it that they say about those who live by the sword ? Stand aside , please . Is that some sort of prison term for " You 're a dead woman " ? I can 't take the door off its hinges if you 're standing in front of it . Do you really think we 're just gonna let you in there ? If the prison is in an uproar , that means the warden is in trouble . She 's always supported my work . I would like to help . - Good ? - Yeah , yeah . Warden , no . Wait ! Get out of here . Let 's move . Get out ! Target has arrived . Repeat , target has arrived . Sam ? Sam ? It 's happening again . You should have warned me , Petey . Dad ? If you knew I was never coming home , why didn 't you say something ? Repeat , target is on the move . Let 's move in . Negative . Negative . The plan is to extract at the stairs . Sam , wait ! I was a kid . It was just a feeling . I was afraid . Well , it 's time to be a man . Take responsibility for your actions . Your fears , your regrets . It 's your fault . You were late . Was I ? You killed me , Bunny , and now you 've got to make it right . Time to pay the price , boy . The cruelest prison is the one we build for ourselves out of fear and regret . What ? Not a day goes by that I don 't miss you , but you would have gone to work that morning whether I would have warned you or not , and I have no more regret ... Regret ... ... about not stopping you . And I have no more fear ... ... out of fear that I did the wrong thing . Regret has no place in your life . It wasn 't my fault . It 's just ... It 's who you were . And who I try and be every day of my life . The cruelest prison is the one that we build for ourselves . Stay away from me , Sam ! Myka . Myka , listen to me . You can fight this . Okay ? You know what happened in Denver . All your planning and preparations , they weren 't enough . You know the truth . Don 't be afraid of it . This is the report . Remember ? You know what 's in it . Don 't be afraid . Sam said I killed him . You know that 's not the truth . Myka , listen , you don 't need a report to tell you what you already know in your heart . You did everything right . Sam didn 't listen to you . That 's why he 's dead . He screwed up . Not you . Do you understand ? Now tell Sam the truth . I 'm sorry , Sam . Sorry 's not going to bring me back , Bunny . I 'm sorry because you made the mistake , not me . You were late . No . No . You were early . The target made you and you got yourself killed . I love you , Sam . I always will . But I have to move on . I have to move on . Wow , it 's ... You okay ? It 's getting worse . Yeah , I 'm fine . What are we going to do with this ? Okay . Artie said ... The picture in the old warden 's office ... Right . Right . Yes . So it was there . Hurry , Artie ! Oh , good idea ! What is that ? It sounds like a truck . No , there 's no truck . Oh , my God ! All right , it 's a truck . Wait , wait . Come on ! Come on ! Hang on ! Hey , what 's that for ? To get rid of the body ? No , it 's a good backup plan if this doesn 't work . What do you mean if it doesn 't work ? I don 't think I 'm going to like this . Whoa , girl ! Come and get me ! Artie , no , don 't do it ! No , please , Artie ! Oh , God , I hope you 're a good shot . Please , Artie , please be good at this . Just don 't move ! Okay ! I promise I 'll be good from now on ! Grab it ! Okay , I 'm trying . Got it . Artemis Maximus ! That was awesome ! Yeah , it kind of was awesome , wasn 't it ? Yeah . All right , let 's get out of here . You got to take that off right away . Okay . Now . Now . Yeah . Oh , God . Hey , are you hurt ? No . No , I 'm fine . What happened ? Well , it 's a long story . I hope you like the cross . Pete ! Oh , my God . Help me . What happened ? Oh , God . Oh , man . Okay , okay , he 's losing a lot of blood . We got to get him out of here . No , no , no . No . No . It 's all right . He 's chosen me for sacrifice . I 'm on a new path . How many times do I have to write this , Artie ? Okay . All right . Claudia , all right . Okay . You know what ? No . Yeah . Enough of doing it that way . All right . So , now , Claudia . Okay . Now focus , don 't just write it . Believe it . No . Yes . Oh . How long you been working on that ? Since I lost my father . Artie , I 'm sorry . When did he die ? He 's alive . I just hope that finishing this will help us find each other again . Myka ! Yeah ? Hey . Hey . So listen , I 'm taking the girls out for a little night on the town . You know , which in this part of South Dakota means going for ice cream . Mmm-hmm . You want to come ? I 'm beat . All right . You want me to bring you something back ? You know I don 't eat sugar . Right . Butter pecan , caramel sauce , chocolate sprinkles . You all right ? I 'm good . You know ... All right , well , remember , if you want to talk ... Maybe tomorrow . I 'll have my people call your people . You do that . Bye . Bye . Previously on Warehouse 13 ... That 'll take you directly to who has the sword , and that will lead you to MacPherson . Who Who ? I wasn 't here when everything went down between Artie and MacPherson , but I know it was bad . It 's called the past rearing its ugly head . And someone out there is running around using ... That 's right , someone , and that someone is MacPherson . He wanted more than the sword . He wanted to mess us up as a team . Now it 's up to you to stop him . Hello , Arthur . Done . I win . It 's not a race . Said the tortoise to the hare . You know , in the story , the tortoise actually wins . It 's a fairy tale . How is a turtle going to beat a rabbit ? It 's not a fairy tale . It 's a fable , a life lesson . Slow and steady wins the race . Okay , here 's a life lesson , Pete fast , Pete win . You all finished ? Hey . Hey , Artie . Artie . Yeah ? If you were making a bet , who 's faster , a turtle or a rabbit ? Yeah . You finished the reports ? Yeah . Who are these going to ? Not Mrs. Frederic . Yeah , she doesn 't seem like the paperwork type . No , these go above all our pay grades . Who ? Myka , one day you 'll know all answers to all questions . Just not today . Okay . Fine . Enjoy your top secrets . I just got to go . I just can 't leave that courier waiting . What A courier ? What is this , the Wells Fargo Wagon ? Haven 't you ever heard of e-mail ? No , no , no . That 's not nearly secure enough , because we ... It doesn 't matter . You guys are having a day to yourselves , right ? Have fun . Claudia 's doing chores . And I 'll see you later . Doing chores where ? Uh ... In the Warehouse . Scalpel . Thank you , Nurse . There 's an awful lot of blood . I think I need some suction . Ganza ! Good as new . And get into the corners this time . Don 't make me push you . Go on . Ew , warm . Mmm . Frosty goodness . Okay . " Repair auto-vac . " Slice-o-pie . " Tighten and lubricate zip line . " It sounds kind of dirty when you say it like that . God , ancient junk-oleum . You got to update this turd some day , Artie . Hey , be careful . No . No , no , no , no . Crap . Crappity , crap , crap , crap ! Oh , my God . This is not good ! This is not going to look good on my report card . Oh , my God . Okay , don 't panic . Oh , my God . WWAD ? What would Artie do ? Um ... Momentum . Got to get momentum . All right . Come on , momentum , let 's go . No , no , no , no , no . This sucks ! So if it isn 't Mrs. Frederic , then who 's getting those reports ? I don 't know . Mr. Frederic ? Claudia ? I brought donuts . Donut . It 's chocolate . Mmm . What 's " AD " ? Artifact disturbance . You know , you really need to read the manual . That can 't be good . Claudia ? Claudia ! Um ... Sorry . Yeah , I was just wondering ... I was hoping that you could take a message to the higher-ups for me . This MacPherson situation , I realize that they prefer a hands-off approach , but they ... You 're talking . We don 't talk . Oh . I didn 't think there was a rule . I just thought you weren 't particularly social . I see I was right about that . God . Hi . She would like a word . I 'm sure she would . Let 's just follow the zip line . She 's bound to turn up . I just hope she 's okay , you know . Uh , Claudia 's like bamboo . You can bend her all you want , she 'll never break . This is hers . How do you know ? We have to get rid of Artie 's BeDazzler . Hello . Hmm . Is that a dodgeball ? How did that get in here ? Hell , no . Um ... Did that just do what I think it did ? Yeah . Yeah . Gosh ! Is that thing having babies , or ... Yeah , look . Okay , okay , let 's get out of here . Okay . Those things hit us every time we look away . Yeah , I 'm going to go with you on that so I don 't end up with a concussion . Um , ooh ... The screen . What ? Right ? Let 's read the screen . Yes . " Baylor Dodgeball . " Used for military dexterity and agility training . " Multiplies upon contact . " That we already know . " Acquired after the bludgeoning deaths of five cadets in 1972 . " Bludgeoning is bad . Agreed . Agreed . Okay , there 's a neutralizing station around the corner . There should be . Okay . Ah ! Ah ! Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Ready ? On three . Okay . Three . Let 's see how these puppies like a neutralizer flea bath . Why isn 't it working ? Okay , this is bad . What 's happening ? Why isn 't it working ? I don 't know . It 's busted . Okay , what do we do now ? Plan B. What 's Plan B ? I was hoping that you knew . No . Okay , wait . What 's that one ? " Breathe underwater . " " Hear colors . " Okay . " Grow fingernails fast . " " Summon locusts . " That 's not ... They 're dodgeballs . Yes , yes , that 's already established . That 's how you win at dodgeball . You have to catch it . No , these are too fast . And what about that whole death-by-bludgeoning thing ? No , no , no , no . Look , you look away , right ? And when they go for you , I 'll catch one . I think we should go with Plan C. What 's Plan C ? Well , I run away and you get pummeled . Look ! Pete ? Pete ? Who smells like tuna fish now , Ralph Brunsky ? Who ? Huh ? Who ? Oh , I was just having a little playground flashback . Oh . Hi , there . Welcome to Ted 's . I 'm Theadora , but everybody calls me Ted . Party of one ? No , no , I 'm meeting that woman right over there , and it 's rarely a party . Hello . Oh , Arthur , have a seat . Why are we meeting here ? We need to have a chat . The pie of the day is banana cream . I highly recommend it . Made it myself . Yeah , a steak , bloody , black coffee , two pieces of the pie . Two ? Um , just a house salad . Leena 's got me on a diet . Maybe just one piece of that pie , ' cause she made it herself . How are things at the Warehouse ? They 're good . They 're fine . A little chaotic , but it 's a good kind of chaos . And the missions ? No one 's been killed . You can 't ask for more than that . And we have an excellent retrieval rate . What about the incidents in Paris or Las Vegas or Colorado ? Mrs. Frederic , you know all about those . Why are you asking me about them ? I 'm forgetful . Refresh my memory . You were saying about Paris ? Claudia , there 's half a donut in the office . How far do you think she could have gotten before the zip line snapped ? Could be the other end of the Warehouse . There 's an end ? I hope so . Duck and cover . Okay , that was bigger than usual . To hell with this . I 'm going to see if I can spot her from up here . Well , be careful . Whoa . What is it ? Go down the aisle , cross two over and turn right . It 's Leena 's . But how ? And there 's a Claudia-shaped hole in the roof . Claudia ? Are you here ? Wait , you guys ! No , no , no , no ! Don 't close the door ! Thank God . We were following the zip line , and the ... Yeah , no , I 'm good . I mean , we 're all trapped in here for eternity , but otherwise I 'm solid . Yeah . Okay . Let 's just get back to the office so we can fix the ... What What ? What the hell ? This is what I 've been saying . First the goo doesn 't work , Mmm-hmm . Then one of those static balls tries to cook us and now , a clingy house . The Warehouse is in a bad mood today . FYI , if anyone has to use the bathroom , don 't flush . Trust me . Okay . Okay , you know what ? Just ... We just have to wait and think about this for a second . New plan . Scoring that an 8.5 . Next time , you got to stick the landing ! Let 's all just stop and think about this a second . That 's a good plan . Good plan . Claudia , did you try climbing back out of the same hole that you fell in ? Yeah , came right back in through the fireplace . I don 't recommend it . And you trust Pete and Myka ? With my life . They 're consummate professionals . Mrs. Frederic , I have to ask you , why specifically ... Excuse me , we 're having a private ... Do you mind ? Oh , no , that 's all right . Okay . What is he ... Very sorry . Private party . Wait , what is going on ? I thought they would never leave . Okay , here we go . You be careful now . This is a hot plate . I think we can begin . Mr. Valda ? Hello , Irene . Mr. Valda , nice to see you again . This is Agent Nielsen . Just a minute . What is this ? That 's a house salad . Bering and Lattimer are consummate professionals . Thank you , Theadora . So , as you stated in the past , Agents Bering and Lattimer 's mission was ... Look . Do you mind telling me exactly what is happening here ? Arthur , Mr. Valda 's asking the questions . Please don 't interrupt him . Yeah . Well , I don 't think I 'm going to be answering any questions until you tell me what this is about . Sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority . What higher authority ? The ... The Regents . These are the Regents ? The Regents meet here ? They do today . Do you really expect me to believe ... What exactly were you expecting , Agent Nielsen ? Hooded , cloaked figures standing in half-light around a perpetually burning flame ? He 's seen too many movies . You know , I just would have thought that ... This waitress is a Regent ? John Adams was a farmer , Abraham Lincoln was a small-town lawyer . Plato , Socrates were teachers , Jesus was a carpenter . To equate judgment and wisdom with occupation is , at best , insulting . Yeah , that 's not what I meant . I know what you meant . Who would you have control the Warehouse ? Kings ? Popes ? Politicians ? There 'd be nothing left of it . Yeah . No , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . It 's just , you know , I didn 't think ... Yes , that 's one of the reasons we needed to speak with you . Your reluctance to think . Irene ? Mrs. Frederic . Thank you , Theadora . So as I was saying , you stated in the past that Agents Bering and Lattimer 's mission was to " Snag it , bag it and tag it , " correct ? Yeah , well , you know , I mean , I said that . I didn 't mean to denigrate the job description . Yet in their brief tenure as field agents , they managed to destroy James Braid 's chair ... If you just let me explain . Lewis Carroll 's mirror . That wasn 't destroyed . Your agents released a malevolent entity into the Warehouse , allowing it access to dangerous artifacts . It was an accident . It was a total accident . It is not uncommon for artifacts to be occasionally destroyed for the greater good . And Agents Lattimer and Bering , I mean , they 've repeatedly shown bravery , they 've shown quick-thinking . They 're an excellent team , and they 're probably the best agents that the Warehouse has ever had . Arthur , their abilities are not in question here . Oh . This is about me ? Not only you . Your former partner . MacPherson ? Okay , okay , so this version of the BB is in the Warehouse because ... It 's an artifact . But can this whole place be an artifact ? Like , is that even possible ? Yeah , pretty much anything is possible . Okay , so maybe there was an artifact in the original that they couldn 't take out , right ? Mmm-hmm . So they just moved the whole thing . And rebuilt the new one without it . Look for anything here that 's different from our BB . All right . Okay , that was kind of cool . All right . We had this little , like , group-think thing going on . Gold stars all around . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey . I do not recognize that chair . You were sleeping in it last week . What about this ugly lamp ? Those light bulbs burnt out a month ago , but this ... This is new . Or old . It 's fused to the wall . This is it . Huh . It 's a painting of this room . And we can 't leave this room . Seems like quite the coinky-dink , don 't you think ? Yeah , how very Salvador Dali . Do you think this painting 's keeping us here ? Maybe . Pete , look at the lamp . What ? Okay , now look at the painting . Claudia put it back in a different spot . It changed because of what you did . Okay , okay . So maybe if I do something to the picture ... That happens . Sick ! After you . Okay . Your turn . Don 't mind if I do . Don 't even bother . At least that was new . Man , you know what ? This thing is useless . Did I do that ? Well , neither of us did . I can see the Warehouse . Okay , there 's a letter opener , if I remember ... Yes . Okay . Okay . Let 's go . All right . Safe and sound . What ? That . Maybe we should have stayed inside . We need to get back to the office . No need . " What are you doing wasting time installing backup terminals in the aisle , " foolish red-haired girl ? " Because you never know when you might need one , Artie . Nice . Hey-oh . Okay , looks like the problem is in the Gooery . What 's a Gooery ? I 'm guessing it 's Claudia-speak for the Neutralizer Processing Center . Uh-huh . Right . Of course . Well , it 's Chapter 197 in the manual . It 's 1,000 pages long . I 'll wait for the movie . Okay , the Neutralizer Processing Center is what pumps the purple goo through the Warehouse , creating a stability field . Yeah , it 's like all the gack in here are nuclear rods , right ? As long as there 's coolant , it 's all good . The Gooery jakes out the coolant . It keeps the artifacts from getting all artifact-y on their own . Okay , so the Gooery , cool name by the way , needs to go back online . Man with a plan . Okay , so does Chapter 198 say what happens if we don 't get it working again ? The same thing that happens to the nuclear rods without the coolant , except probably worse . We 've got maybe half an hour left . What 's the fastest way there ? Let me see . We got to go through aisle Haddonfield 79 , then loop around Carlsbad 22 ... No , no , no , no . Why don 't we just go straight through here ? Because that 's the Dark Vault . Okay . See ? Now , I know what that is . Didn 't read the manual . That 's where all the dangerous stuff is . Yeah , like mega dangerous , dude . Mondo . Okay , okay , but we still ... We can 't loop around . I say we take the risk . I agree . It 's not often that I agree , but I agree . Guys , if we 're going to do this thing , let 's do this thing . Wait , no , no , no . You 're not going anywhere , Claud . You 're going to stay put . I 'm coming with . No , no . We 're the agents . We 're the ones that agreed to risk our lives , not you . Yeah , but this is my home , too . You might need my help . She 's right . She has read the manual . Am I never going to hear the end of that ? She knows this place , okay ? I say that she comes with . Please . Okay , fine , but you stick close and you do exactly as we say . All right . Suicide mission with the team . Kind of exciting . I 'm excited . Come on . And , in attempting to save Joshua Donovan , you placed his sister , yet another civilian , in danger . I 'm sorry . Excuse me , please . If this is about MacPherson , then why am I being asked about cases that have absolutely nothing to do with MacPherson ? Agent Nielsen , I will ask the questions . It might be wise to let this run its course for now . All right , fine . Fine . Yes . Yes . In saving Joshua , I maybe put Claudia in a little danger , but I promised her that if ... You promised ? You promised ? It sounds as if personal feelings became involved in professional judgment . This has been an issue in the past , has it not ? It may have come up , but his artifact-retrieval rate is excellent . It 's the highest in years . Thank you . It 's simply the facts . Very well , then . The facts . Thank you , Theadora . Did you or did you not , on two separate occasions , involve Daniel Dickinson , A high-ranking Secret Service officer , in Warehouse 13 matters , all of which were classified at the highest level ? Yes . We have a unique relationship with the United States government , a relationship that your actions have now complicated . I contacted a fellow government official in the normal course of performing my job , a job to which I have dedicated the last 40 years of my life . No one 's questioning your dedication , Arthur . What we are questioning , Agent Nielsen , is your future . It 's sealed with an omega-level security code . Can you hack it ? Pope , Catholic , bear , woods , you know the drill . And done . Man , this place is creep-tastic . Okay . Don 't look , don 't touch . Just keep moving . These objects are so dangerous they can only be controlled by purple containment fields . Why are the neutralizer systems still working in here ? Backup generators because everything 's so dangerous . Don 't worry . They should hold up long enough for us to Realize my karma sucks . We 're starting to lose them . Just keep moving . This is going to take me a minute . Is it a different code ? Yeah , I gotta use an FTL ASCII binary algorithm . Did you just make that up ? Hey , little guy . What are you in for ? Almost there . Hang in there , guys . And we 're good . Okay , let 's go . Pete ? Pete ? Pete ? Pete , what are you ... - Whoa , whoa , whoa . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . Pete . Crap . Pete ! Can you hear us ? Pete , what are you doing ? Pete , come to the door . Pete ! Pete , can you hear me ? Pete , are you okay ? Pete . Pete , are you okay ? Attention , Warehouse agents . Mrs. Frederic . Thank God . Emergency evacuation required . Repeat , emergency evacuation required . Mrs. F , we 're down here ! Energy levels approaching critical mass . That 's a recording . Yeah . Emergency evacuation required . That 's the most I 've ever heard her say . I know . Well , this is a whole other code level . It 's going to take me a few minutes . I 'm sorry . You know what ? What ? You know what ? Step aside . Just stand over there . What are you ... Okay , that was flat-out awesome . Pete , what are you doing , man ? Wait , wait , wait , wait . Stop , stop , stop . We gotta go . The circle . I think it 's there for a reason , right ? Pete , what you doing ? Nothing . He 's looking at a typewriter . It 's not just any typewriter . It 's Sylvia Plath 's . She wrote this poem called Ennui , and ultimately , she took her own life and ... Myka , I spend some serious time in the bell jar . I know who Sylvia Plath is . Right . What 's that thing doing to him ? It 's sucking the life out of him . We have to get him out of the containment field . Pete . Pete , can you come here ? Why ? What 's the point ? What do we do ? There 's no time . Okay , you , go to the Gooery , get it online . I 'll stay here and deal with this . Like , just on my own , or ... Yeah . Claudia , you know this Warehouse , okay ? I trust you . Right . Yeah . No , I 'll just ... Yeah , I 'll do it then . Go . Get going . Tick-tock . I have a few more questions . Do you ? Really ? Yeah , I have a few of my own . Arthur , don 't do anything foolish . This exercise is a pointless and insulting waste of time . I asked you not to do this . If MacPherson is out there ... What ? Lf ? Lf ? I have a wound right here , right here , in my shoulder that should prove it . He 's out there . He 's out there , and he 's planning something far worse than any of you can imagine . What are you doing about it ? What are you doing ? You 're tying my hands . You leave us no choice . You say MacPherson is a threat , and you use that to justify violating Warehouse protocol time and time again . Pretty soon , you 're going to be making up your own rules just to sanction your actions . Does this sound familiar , Agent Nielsen ? Huh ? Sound like someone we both knew ? Mr. Valda , he knows the rules . He knows that I 'm forced to follow them , don 't you see that ? And if I 'm going to take MacPherson , and I am , then rules have to be broken . That 's the only thing that 'll work . You know what 's not going to work ? Reining in the one person that can stop him before it 's too late . Look at all of you . You know , you 're not out in the field . You 're here , hiding in plain sight . What are you doing ? You 're judging me , you 're judging my methods because you 're afraid of him . Tell me I 'm wrong . Arthur . No , no , no , no , no . Mr. Valda , look at me . You tell me right to my face , tell me I 'm wrong . Yeah , well , either fire me or kill me . Or let me do my job . Better make a decision , and you better make it fast before he makes it for you . I believe the ball is in your court . Okay , Pete , we 're running out of time here , so ... Okay , look , what I 'm going to do , I 'm going to take off my belt . All right ? I 'm going to throw it to you , you grab it and I 'll pull you out of there , okay , Pete ? Whatever . Okay , grab the belt . Pete , grab the belt . Pete , grab it . Grab the belt . Okay . You 're a rabbit , right ? Pete , you 're not a tortoise , so win . Win the race . Just grab it . Win , lose , what 's the diff ? Okay . Warehouse , give me something . Give me something . Thank you . Okay , Pete . You again ! You okay ? Yeah . What was that ? Okay , listen , we 're running out of time . The Warehouse is about to explode . Okay , so just come on . Oh , boy . Critical mass in five minutes . Critical mass in five minutes . Really ? Cliche , much ? Yeah . Gross . Well , it 's not so bad . Kind of smells like chicken . Critical mass in four minutes . Are you okay ? I 'm okay . I 'm just a little drained , that 's all . You go . Go ahead . I 'll catch up . Are you sure ? Yeah , yeah . You go . Okay . Go . Myka . Yeah ? Thank you . Okay , ugly , I 'm just going to pull you out . This is slippery . Okay , the gloves are coming off . Yeah . Okay . Now I want Italian food . No . Not the plan . Nope . Critical mass in three minutes . Shut up . Claudia ? Myka ! Hey , I know it looks like I 'm having a bunch of fun , but help . Almost there . No , no , no , don 't touch . Way too sticky . No point in us both getting ground up . Okay , pull . What is this stuff ? If I remember properly , it 's hours of fun for the whole family . All right . No , they lied . It 's not even minutes of fun , really . Where 's Pete ? Still bored out of his mind ? No , he 'll be here in a minute . Just keep pulling . Critical mass in two minutes . Mind if I yell ? I 'm going to yell . Pete ! Pete , help ! Pete . Chicks . Pete . Pete , you have to find something to cut this stuff . " Stuff " ? You don 't mean our arms , right ? No . Don 't touch it . - It 's sticky . MRS. - Attention , Warehouse agents , energy levels are now at omega levels . Critical mass in one minute . We 're boned . How much time did she just say ? Fifty seconds . See , see ? Even on tape , she still creeps up . Please ! Just please go find something . Okay , okay . Wait . My tool belt . What ? Right there . Get the snow globe . Okay . I got it . Hey , hey , hey . Use it to freeze the gears . Pete . Okay , okay . I got an idea . Hold on . Hold on , hold on . All right . 30 seconds . You guys gotta pull really hard . Yes . You ready ? Now . Attention , Warehouse agents , emergency abated . Nice work . Thank you . God . How do you do that ? That was quite a performance . Sounded better in my head . So am I fired ? Worse . They want you to stay . Bering and Lattimer are not the best agents we 've ever had . You are . They said that ? It was said . And they were smart enough to believe me . Oh . Thanks . Simply the facts . What about MacPherson ? Good hunting . Try not to get yourself killed . No , no , no . Don 't try to be all friendly with me now . Um ... Hey , Myka ? Yeah ? I just wanted to say thanks for , you know , trusting me before . Claudia , I ... I know what it 's like to be your age and have no one believe in you . Yeah . You 're good . No , you 're really good . You 'll be fine . Thanks . Hey , you know , if you 're not busy later , maybe you could show me how to do that Kick thing . 'Cause , like , I tried it on a light switch and I think I broke my toe . And I know I broke the light switch . That would be fun , you know , and maybe you could teach me how to hack into the ... The grid ? Yeah . You want to hack the grid ? I want to hack the grid . Okay . Yeah , I 'm down . Okay , so I cleaned up the last of the mess . You know , I bet Artie won 't even notice . Won 't notice what ? Your welcome-back surprise party . Surprise ! You look surprised . Doesn 't he look surprised ? Tell me . The zip line crashed and there were these dodgeballs . Some glob got in the Gooery gears . And then we went to Leena 's BB ... We went to the Dark Vault and I was standing ... There was a thunderstorm brewing above the Warehouse . She came over and pushed me . In the Dark Vault ... I cut my arm . We fixed it . We fixed everything . But it 's fixed . Good as new . It 's all ... Totally . Fixed . How long did you have before the Warehouse was going to explode ? Under a minute . More like 30 seconds . That 's lucky . I once got there with 17 . And her voice gets really annoying when she 's counting down seconds one at a time . You didn 't lose that thing I had made for you , did you ? That ... Oh , no . Great . That 's good . It survived . Yay ! Wait , are we not in trouble ? You guys had it under control , right ? That we did , amigo . That we did . All right . I don 't know about you guys , but I 'm starving . Who wants Mexican ? Uh , I do . Need tacos stat . Artie ? No , I had pie . Well , I almost had pie . But go , go , go , enjoy yourselves . Enjoy yourselves . Now I want pie . You always want pie . Who doesn 't want pie ? Maybe just bring me one taco . Whatever . And rest up because you are going to need it . Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Whoever stole the sword has other things that belong in the Warehouse , which would mean that we have competition . Lattimer and Bering , right ? They 're so raw , so untrained , so corruptible . What about your folks ? Colorado Springs . They own a bookstore called Bering Sons . Well , they must be proud of you . You ever see that movie The Great Santini ? With the tough dad and the scared kids ? It 's like that , huh ? Yeah , except it wasn 't over in two hours . Yeah , just up the street . He 's open . Oh , my . Myka ? Artie , I 'm here , in MacPherson 's apartment . Myka , be careful . MacPherson 's gone . It 's another dead end . Found him . Pete 's having better luck in Montreal . How much better ? MacPherson 's headed east on Sainte-Catherine ! Artie , I 've got the cops on me . I 'll get rid of the cops . You just stay on MacPherson . There 's an alley on the right . He 's heading for the subway . We got him , Artie . Be careful , Pete . We do not know if he has them . Artie . Give it up , MacPherson . We win this one . Artie , he has the cymbals . He has the cymbals . Pete , you got to get out of there . Just get out of there . If you see the cymbals , cover your ... Pete , Artie , what happened ? Is everything okay ? Pete ? Pete , can you hear me ? Pete ! Nevermore . Pete , Pete . Pete , you got to get up . Mom , I 'm up . And I won 't be late . I 'm okay . I managed to cover my ears . Where is he Where 's MacPherson ? He 's gone , Artie . I lost him . I lost MacPherson . Hey , Mom , listen , I 'm busy right now . I can 't really ... Myka , it 's your father . He started feeling bad , and I ... What ? Just come on home . Just come back . Just come home . We got to wrap it up . Artie , I need to go home . I 'm going home . My father 's dying . Dude . Does Tamara know you 're stalking her , or is this just for makeup tips ? Give it back , Greg . Boo-hoo , baby . Yeah , I don 't know , Leena . It 's complicated . MacPherson put decoys and bogus informational breadcrumbs ... Put them all over the world . And my software narrowed them down to two locations , and Montreal turned out to be , you know , the one that was ... Did you say you wanted no ice in your ... God , don 't do that . Mrs. Frederic , what did you do with Leena ? Sorry , would you care for a ... No . You 're here because you want to know what happened . Two policemen dead , Arthur . I know what happened . The Montreal police have a dashboard camera in the car . But I told Pete to ... He had the recording ... How did you ... Please . Look , we were following a lead . You took a shot in the dark . We hit the center of that target . With a small caliber bullet . Pete 's caliber is very large . We ... You know what ? I 'm done with this analogy . We had an agreement . You were supposed to gather information . I know . Bring it to me . Yeah . And we would plan to get MacPherson together . You had no offensive strategy , no defensive posture , no containment plan . You were not prepared . Where 's Lattimer and Bering ? Out . Manage my assets better , or I swear on the ashes of the first twelve Warehouses , I will take them away . I can get MacPherson again . I don 't doubt it . And you make no moves against him without consulting me first . Yes , ma 'am . Do you have ... How does she do that ? All right , everyone . Please close your booklets , ladies and gentlemen . Tamara , can you gather them up , please ? Okey-doke . John Steinbeck 's East of Eden . Betrayal , lost love , jealousy . Good stuff . Please read the first 50 pages for discussion tomorrow , if you would . Have a good one . Bobby , can you come here for a sec ? You okay ? You seem a little distracted . Computer lab thing . Up late . Did you talk to her yet ? I 've got something for you . " So with the world thy gentle ways Thy grace ... " Thanks , Tamara . No problem . Poetry . Burns , Blake , Byron . That 's just the B 's . Let them do the talking for you . Good luck . Mom . Mom ? Mom . Myka , hi . Hi . Your cell phone isn 't working , and I tried calling , but ... The battery died . Where is he ? He 's fine . Don 't worry . He 's upstairs . Why don 't you go up and see him ? Sorry I scared you , but he 's fine now . Hey . Hey . Yep . A wasted trip , kiddo . You bring a gun in here ? Yeah . It 's packed downstairs , disassembled . I thought you were in the hospital . I thought you were dying . Your mother overreacted . I 'm fine . It 's not a stroke ? No , no , no . Not a stroke . No , we 've got a few more tests , but , oh , God , you should have heard him screaming . I didn 't scream . I 've never screamed in my life . Do you remember what happened ? No , I don 't remember anything except waking up in the ambulance wondering what the fuss was all about . Jeannie , get the girl some food . Mom , I 'm not hungry . That 's because you 've starved your hunger nerve to death . The doctors said it might be a virus . You 're too skinny . An inner ear or a spinal inflammation . They 've got him on steroids and an anti-viral . Mrs. B. Okay , I am gonna need this recipe . The hot sauce is killer . Great . You 've got some ... Look at you . Sorry . What are you ... We 've met Pete . He 's a pip . Just got here . Met your dad . Are these yours ? I found them in the kitchen . Yeah . I 'm so sorry . They 're for collecting evidence . I 'm sorry . What are you doing here ? Well , I thought you might need the support . Artie disagreed but was overruled . By who ? By me , the pip . Well , I don 't need any support . Miss Independent , me , neither . Seriously , Dad , I 've been here for like what , a minute ? Miss Touchy , too . Oh , please , Warren . I 've got to go down to the basement . Eat something . I 'm not hungry . Well , I 'm going to get that guest room ready . And for your bed , I 've got some new flannel sheets I got at Dodi 's . No , no , no . You are my guests . It 's my house . You 're my guests . Wow . What about work ? Well , work vanished and until it reappears , I 'm here as a friend in this hopefully not-too-stressful time . I mean , it could have been worse , right ? Your dad . Thank you . I appreciate it . And you 're right , it could have been worse . Hey , wait . Wait , Myka . Myka . Myka . Yeah . I was talking to your dad . He thinks you 're still in D.C. They both do . Well , yeah , and if you tell them any differently , I swear I will drop a dictionary on your crotch . What ? I 'm supposed to tell them that I 'm working for the world 's most dangerous Antiques Roadshow ? No , you tell them the truth , or at least part of the truth . I don 't know , something to cut the stress . I 'm not stressed . You 're lying to them . It 's a force of habit , you know ? It keeps my dad from being disappointed . You have hot sauce all over your face . " ... beauty Shall be an endless theme of praise " and love " " ... gently To sleep on her breast " Deeply to sleep From the heaven of her breast " " ... tenderly kissed me She fondly caressed " and then I fell gently ... " Dad ! Mom ! Myka , get back . Watch your eyes . Warren . Warren . What happened ? What happened is your dad 's got an artifact . Myka ! Myka ! Hey ! Where 's the notebook ? It 's this way . Myka . Mom , it 's okay . Myka , who is it ? Is she ... This is Claudia . We work with her . What 's that ? That is ... Claudia , back here . That 's for me . No , you wait just a minute . I want some answers , Myka . Now , first of all , who 's the man in the little TV ? His name is Artie . And is he a doctor ? No . But ... No . Your father belongs in a hospital . This isn 't medical . Mom , this is something else . And how do you know ? You 're not a doctor . You protect the President . Not anymore . I 'm still with the government , but I am doing this now . What ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to help Dad , Mom , so just let me do that . Trust me , please . You ready ? Yeah . Mom , just stay here . Whatever you see or hear , just stay put . But ... Just don 't move . Do you ... It 'll be okay . They do this kind of stuff all the time , so ... Claudia . I got to ... What 's going on ? They 're really good at this . Here it is . Kill it . Duck and cover . What 's happening ? Mom , how 's Dad ? He 's the same . Why ? Was something supposed to happen ? Check his arms . It 's still there . It 's ink . Ink . Take it out . Now what ? The neutralizer failed because I think we 're dealing with a bifurcated object . It 's got at least two parts , and they 're each dependent on the other . And that notebook is just one half of the package . So what 's the other half ? You know , based on the manifestations of the ink , then that would tell me that it 's a pen . Most ... Well , a pen . Anyway ... By the way , the shipper 's address ? That 's completely phony . MacPherson sent it , didn 't he ? I don 't know that . So what ? He 's coming after family now ? What does he want ? Well , he wants to hurt us because we 're going after him . Stop , stop , stop , stop . Just stop it . We don 't know who sent it or why . If it is MacPherson , it could be revenge , or mischief , or a diversion so that we 're doing this while he 's doing something else . Just in case , just to be safe , I 've ... I 'm circling the wagons around Joshua and around Pete 's family . Who or why does not matter . What matters is your father and the notebook . Now . Now , listen , I 've analyzed the text . It ain 't good . It 's Poe . Edgar Allan Poe . The reason that the book is getting under your father 's skin is because the pen is not with it . So , what ? We bring the pen together with the notebook , and this all stops ? Yeah . Well , probably if it follows a typical bifurcated artifact scenario . It can 't be an accident that this book found its way to your dad . Look , Myka , right now your father is a conduit . The notebook , the pen , they 're linked through his energy , through his love of the written word . So where is this pen ? Well , I 'm searching for coinciding incidents right now . You know , I 've got all the filters off . But it 's causing trouble somewhere . But I 'll find it . You 'll get it . The next time he has an attack , I 'll trace the pen , you 'll retrieve it and reunite it with the notebook . How long does he have ? I don 't know what you 're ... How long do we have ... What ? How long does he have , Artie ? My father can 't take this much longer . A day , maybe two . But you can help him . Until I land on something , Myka , just surround him with his books , with his world , and read to him , Myka . Read to him books that he loves , and use those words to fight what 's happening to him . And just try and keep him connected to reality if you can . Bobby 's not that bad . Look , all I 'm saying is watch out . Geek love . Ugh . " I might have been improved for my whole life . " I might have been made another creature perhaps , for life , " by a kind word at that season . " Do you want me to take over ? No . No , I 'm fine . He 's gonna be okay , Mom . I 'll be back in a sec . I 'm just gonna take these dishes . The freak 's probably swiped your panties from gym class or something . Gross . Tiger . Dad ? Tiger . Stop it . Fire . Dad ? Fire ! Dad . Help ! Somebody get some help ! Artie 's got something . What ? At the precise moment your dad was shouting , " Fire , " a kid in Portland , Oregon was burned by some bizarre wall of flame shooting from his locker . No one can explain it . Well , what about the " tiger " thing ? Kid 's a football star for the Kingford Tigers . Let 's go . Wait , Myka , I need you to stay here . I have to help my dad , Pete . I know , but we 've got two artifacts . He 's connected to one . I need you to stay on the notebook . I 'll take care of the pen . Myka , look at me . No one can help your dad right now more than you can . I can 't let you go alone . I 'll take Claudia . Keep her safe . Yeah . There 's something else . What ? I think I 'm hot for your mom . I 'll break it to Dad . Okay . I needed to speak with you , Bobby . Is everything okay ? Is the poetry inspiring you ? Not so much . You know , it seems we had a little burglary here the other day . The story is that it was one of the pens that Edgar Allan Poe used . Oh , he used it . I noticed that you were fascinated with the pen . Are you saying I took it ? You saying I took it ? I 'll tell you what , I 'm gonna go to the lounge for a soda , and if the pen should show up while I 'm gone , well , we 'll just chalk it up to something strange and mysterious . Back in a bit . Mr. Ives . Mr. Ives . No . Here . Wall ? Wall ? Wall what ? You . No . The young man 's burns weren 't serious , but they 've kept him out of football practice . He does have a reputation for scaring people . Really Does he like horror novels , Stephen King , Lovecraft , Poe ? You 're assuming the boy reads . No , he 's just a bully . Look , I mean , how big a deal is this ? I mean , the school 's got a reputation to maintain , and if it gets out that the government is investigating a teenage prank , it 'll put a lot of parents off . You mean donors ? Why do you think it 's just a prank ? Well , we 're not schooling little terrorists here . Somebody in the science class got tired of Permut picking on them and gave him a hot foot . Oh , yeah ? How 's he doing ? He 's fine . You want this open ? No , we 'll take it from here . You 'll want to step back , please . Why ? It 's not dangerous . Please . Thank you . Okay . You ready ? Why not ? Okay , we 're in business . Here we go . So , you had any other incidents ? With what ? Fire ? Well , anything strange , say a tell-tale heart , perhaps ? What ? Here we go . Got to love Artie . What 's that ? You don 't happen to have Edgar Allan Poe 's pen lying around , would you ? Well , actually ... Yes ? Mr. Ives ' classroom . He likes to collect items from famous people . The pen is here , then ? Well , was . Got stolen . This last one was the worst . I know . Dad ? If you 'd been a boy , I 'd have called you Sue . What ? Johnny Cash . It 's a song . A Boy Named Sue . Okay . Make you tough . Well , I 'm sorry I wasn 't a boy . I 'm sorry I wasn 't a father . He has regrets . About me ? Yes . About his life . What do you mean ? He wanted to write books . I know . I know that he wanted to write books . Did you know he wrote a novel ? No . Twelve times . Over and over again . Unpublished . He loved it too much to let it go . He was afraid . Where is it ? A long time ago , when he finally gave up , he told me to burn it . He hasn 't written a thing since . Come on , Pete . Mr. Ives ? Hello ? Nice place for a pen . Soaking up all that Poe juice . Wow . Do you know that ravens are actually brilliant ? They 've adapted to humans like rats and cockroaches . They figured out how to figure us out . What ? Me . Hear anything ? Just the beating of my hideous ... Stop it . Okay . Listen . What is that ? A rat in the wall ? Short story . Guy walled up . Cask of Amontillado . Of Amontillado . Here , take it off there . I don 't want avian flu . Take it ! All right . Mr. Ives ? Who did this to you ? Bobby . Find him . Stop him . Bobby , not cool . Myka , something 's wrong . Artie , I need help . What 's this ? A poem . I wrote it for you . I got to go . We 're losing him . Myka , just read to him . Read it . I have read . I 've read him everything , okay ? It 's not working . You have to find the words that he loves . You just have to find a book that means more to him than anything in the world . Mom , tell me you didn 't burn it . What ? Dad 's book . Aunt Cindy 's bureau , the bottom drawer . Okay , so Ives said that Bobby had a crush on ... What 's her name ? Tamara . Tamara . Right . There 's always a girl . What ? Don 't blame her . Blame testosterone . Crazy , crazy man hormone . I 'm not blaming the girl . I 'm blaming Poe . Bobby ? Crazy , scary man hormone . Check out Miss Teenage Zombie . Oh , right . Bobby and ... Tamara . Tamara , was it ? Right ? That 's a nice pen , Bobby . Why don 't you give it up , huh ? Come on , give it here . You 've got to be kidding me . Bobby ! I got it . Bobby , you 've got to stop this . I know you 're all full of Poe up to your creepy eyeballs , and " Nevermore " and crap , but ... But this isn 't fiction . It 's real ! This is the most real I have ever felt in my entire life . " The Blue Willow Sky by Warren Bering . Chapter One . " When the girl was born , his first thought was fear . " It 's beautiful . Bobby , you 're a good person , but you 're hurting people . You 're hurting yourself and you 're hurting Tamara , and it has to stop . People like you don 't see me . You don 't believe in me . People like you need to be shocked into seeing . You need to be horrified . Then you 'll understand . Understand what , Bobby ? Tell me what . That words have power . " For her . For his daughter . She was his life . " But this isn 't fiction . It 's real ! It 's real ! " She was his life . His only job now was keeping her safe . " She was his life . " It 's working , Myka . Words have power . Something 's happening . Go , go ! Claudia , get the pen . Who are you ? What ... One second . Nice , Claud . Here 's the bag . Get him to a hospital . This still has a hold on him . And Myka 's dad . Myka , I got it . Hey . Hey . How is he ? Is that it ? That 's it . Well , he 's not worse , but he 's not better , not completely . His strength is the only thing that 's keeping that pen from flipping completely out . Okay , the notebook 's in place . Good . Take the pen , keep it in the bag , and just , you know , approach the notebook . I 'm on it . Be careful ! I am . Would you stop yelling at me ? God , somebody turn down his volume or something . Okay , now what ? You know , put the bag right over the notebook , turn it upside down , dump the pen out . Make sure it lands on the notebook and stays there . That 's it ? Just dump it out ? Yeah . Just lay it on the notebook ? Yeah , this isn 't Cirque du Soleil . Just dump the pen on the book and stand back . All right . Artie , nothing 's happening . That 's okay . It 's all right . It 's fine . It 's been a while since they 've been together . Probably they 're just getting reacquainted . Whoa , wait , whoa , whoa . Dad ? What 's this ? Hi . Did I doze off ? Um ... Sort of . I was dreaming . You were reading , and ... You didn 't burn it . No . I did . Okay , well , I think I 've got everything . - Honey . - Yeah . Yeah , I don 't know what it is you do for a living , but you do it very well . I mean that . I 'll see you soon , and we 'll talk . We 'll talk about something other than books . Oh , Mom . Bye , honey . Thank you so much . And you take care of Pete . I always do . Hello . Hello . Got everything ? Yeah . Called the cab ? No . No , no . No , I didn 't . I think , Mr. Poe , that when your things arrive , we 'll stick them in ... Yeah . Madrid Section . That is , if Leena agrees . Arthur . Pete and Myka are in Colorado Springs . Yeah , I know . I should have tried ... And so is MacPherson . What ? How did he ... He was there the whole time . He had us all distracted . I think that was MacPherson 's intent . I 'll take the Farnsworth . Good choice . Hey , Artie . We 're heading home . Myka . Myka , listen . Myka ! That was weird . Hold on . Vibe ? Huge . Your dad . What ? Is this Poe ? Are we back into the Poe thing again ? I don 't know . You two are good . I see why Mrs. Frederic drafted you . I kill this , and it 's lights out for Mom and Dad . You hurt my father . He glimpsed the mind of one of the greatest authors in the world . He 'll thank me later . You 'll be dead later . What do you want ? I want what you risked your lives to get . I 'd have done it myself , but I lack the means . You have until the count of one . You came after family . Arthur started it . What is that supposed to mean ? Ask him . Pete . Now let them go . Do it . Thank you . Consider it a loan . What the hell was that ? Jack the Ripper 's lantern . At least we know where that is now . He used us from the very beginning . No , he used me . Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Claudia Donovan , Warehouse 13 , next generation . Don 't you want to be with people your own age ? Artie , I 'm not my own age . This place is my home . MacPherson 's headed east on Sainte-Catherine ! I want what you risked your lives to get . I can get MacPherson again . I don 't doubt it . You came after family . Arthur started it . What is that supposed to mean ? Ask him . Don 't quote Warehouse dogma to me , Arthur . A woman 's life is at stake . Many peoples ' lives are at stake . And you made an oath . I love her , and I 'm going in there . And you love her . I know that you love her , too . Then you know how agonizing this is for me . We can save her life . What about the consequences ? She lives , other people die . You want that on your head ? You can 't play God . Well , neither can you . Neither you nor Frederic nor the Regents . They sit there , Arthur , and they hoard the things that can save the world . We help them . Well , not anymore . I 'm finished with it . Now , give me that . No . No , I can 't . Give me that . Arthur . Arthur . Five firemen died that night . Only the woman survived . Who was she ? Carol Augustine . She lives in D.C. Now . Alone , as far as we know . And she was MacPherson 's wife ? Yes . Did they ever nail the murdering son of a ... MacPherson was given five consecutive life sentences and banished from the Warehouse . So obviously , MacPherson escaped . After serving two years in confinement , there was an unexplained explosion in the prison . Dozens were killed . We were told that MacPherson was among them . We were misinformed . Well , then he shows up at the Japanese embassy in D.C. Yes , and we 've had Carol under surveillance ever since . I 've been monitoring the D.C. Operation , and he hasn 't made any contact . No , he went after my family instead . I can understand why Artie 's obsessed with him . Well , this guy has no trouble killing anybody , does he ? As you go after him , you 'll do well to remember that . Come on . So how do you banish somebody from the Warehouse , anyway ? It sounds very Romeo and Juliet . No , no , no , no . There 's nothing romantic about it . The walls of this Warehouse are infused with this very rare mineral called Painite . Before MacPherson was incarcerated , he was permanently injected with a substance that reacts violently when in proximity of this Painite . Violently ? Mmm-hmm . Could you be a tad more specific with your modifiers ? I could . If MacPherson were to enter this Warehouse , then his blood would turn acidic and immediately eat through his own veins . Dude . Indeed . Where are you , by the way ? Already through the Middle East , heading into North Africa . I 'll find him . Yeah . It 's what I does . Well , you may have met your match when it comes to hacking through with MacPherson . Oh , yes . Who the best ? What ? What ? You got a nibble ? A chomp . What ? Edgar Allan Poe 's pen ... Let me see . ... for sale . No . Let me see . Excuse me . Uh-huh . Collection ? Why would he be selling artifacts if ... Don 't ... Don 't click that ! Um ... I always run a virus scan before I enter an unknown site . That 's a good idea . So , yeah . No . No , no , no , no . You do not shut down the Claudi-o-meter . Terribly , terribly sorry . Life in the cyber world , bro . I 'm going to need a sec . You know , you could try ... Touch it and die . Thank you for waiting , gentlemen . Mr. Freitag , I feel that this may be of particular interest to you . What exactly does this do , Mr. MacPherson ? Run your fingers along the rim . Consider it a gift , a taste of things to come . Mr. MacPherson , what other artifacts will be for sale ? Mr.Pak , already greedy for more , I see . Well , I am in the process of collecting others as we speak , but in the meantime , behold the Phoenix . This is the reason why we 're here in my factory , this demonstration . Very perceptive , Mr. Freitag . Yes , I didn 't think that cautious gentlemen such as yourselves would want to spend this kind of money on hearsay or legend . You would be correct . Carson , would you just hold this for a moment ? Thank you . What are you doing , man ? He 'll die in there ! Patience ! Patience . Patience . Yes . There . As you see , in the right hands , this can be uniquely useful . What is it What 's wrong with them ? Cause and effect , gentlemen , cause and effect . Even anomalies are bound by their own laws of nature . Insignificant collateral damage , but appropriate for a demonstration . Mr. MacPherson , make it stop . It cannot be stopped . For every life the Phoenix saves , others will be lost . Those who touch the Phoenix , they will be spared , but others are less fortunate . You dare to do this in my factory ? A demonstration , Mr. Freitag . If you haven 't the stomach for it , perhaps the Phoenix is not for you . Gentlemen , imagine this tool in the hands of one of your patriots . The commitment of a suicide bomber who never , ever dies . I managed to crash the computer system , so I 'm sorry . Until we 're up and running , deaf , dumb and blind . Don 't worry . I 'll get us back online . A girl loves a challenge . Oh ! It 's just great . The fate of the Warehouse in the hands of a 16-year-old kid . Okay , 19 . Nineteen . And the same kid who found you and hacked into super-Secretville once already . Okay ? A little faith , please . Why is he selling the pen ? I mean , God knows what else he 's got . What is he up to ? Okay , let 's go over what we don 't know . That could take weeks . Months . Hmm . Years . Hmm . Look , Artie , you must have forgotten something . You know MacPherson better than anybody . There must be some small detail that you 've overlooked . Yeah , something insignificant , a contact he might have used , a favorite place , a relative that you might have forgotten about . You two are , what , interrogating me ? They 're investigating . That 's why we hired them , is it not ? Um , so , about Carol ... How do you know about Carol ? What did ... What ... You told them ? Everything ? No , of course you did . Of course you did . No wonder I 'm getting the third degree . You think you might have asked me before you just blurted out ... Agent Nielsen ! You 're forgetting yourself . Arthur , no one knows what he 's capable of better than you except , possibly , me . Bering and Lattimer will need to know everything if they 're to survive this . Everything . Yeah , sorry . You 're right . It 's just that I never should have gone to see Carol in the first place . When MacPherson went to D.C. And the years had just twisted his thinking , I just didn 't know if I was putting her life in danger . The three of you need to speak to her . No . No , no , no . I 've already put enough of a spotlight on that woman . We 've got no choice , Arthur . She 's our only lead . Dude , don 't sweat it . I 'll cover it from here . After being magnetized to the ceiling and nearly ground up in the Gooery , I think I 'm prepped . What ? Why are you shaking your jowls at me ? You should all get going . I 'll stay with Claudia , and she will brief me on those two events . No matter what he said , you 're not safe . I haven 't seen James MacPherson in 15 years . I never even visited him in prison . Well , that 's hard to believe since he saved your life . Others died that night in my place . I wouldn 't have made that choice . And I 've never forgiven James for making it for me . Artie knows that . You like fresh-cut flowers . I beg your pardon ? They 're all around the apartment . Well , as you said , I like them . Mmm-hmm . There 's a jewelry box in the trash with some wrapping paper . I had a birthday . Your birthday 's in four months . We 're very good at the Google . There 's two umbrellas behind me . One 's pink , one 's black . Was it raining three days ago ? I think it was . He 's not the man you think he is . Carol . He 's changed . Carol , listen to me . I would like to protect you from whatever the hell it is he 's planning to do . God , you come barging in here , disrupting my life . He 's only been here a few times . When was the last ? Three days ago . Well , it 's easy to understand how you would have forgotten that . What 's this ? I have no idea . Let me see that . This is an Egyptian symbol . It 's a was scepter . Represents power . The deities used to carry this around as a sign of their control over the forces of chaos . It 's funny . It 's the same as the pendant you 're wearing around your neck . Oh . Let me see that . That 's very nice . It 's from James ? Yes . You know I have to ask you for it , Carol . Amazing . You think working in some magical storage unit gives you the right to do as you please . Stop protecting him . I never could decide . Does Mrs. Frederic hire arrogant people , or do you just get arrogant by working there ? What is it ? I got a really bad feeling . About what ? I think it 's about Artie . I think ... I think he 's going to ... Never mind . It 's gone now . " 6166 Broadview . " Ironically , the warehouse district . We 're up and running . Taking her to warp speed , Captain . Okay , so you think you can hack into MacPherson 's site ? Well , yeah , duh . But major firewall-age . I mean , you get past one , and there 's another one set up right ... Claudia ? Claudia , what 's wrong ? Who 's that ? That 's him . That 's James MacPherson ? Claudia ... Leena , I know him . How ? He was Joshua 's physics professor . I mean , I was just a kid , but I remember that face . He was the one who gave Joshua Rheticus ' compass . He contacted me . What ? When ? Eight months ago . I was tracking Artie , trying to find this place and I hit a snag . And , out of the blue , I hear from Professor Reynolds , right ? He friends me . We e-mail back and forth . " How 's Joshua ? " Blah , blah , blah . I fill him in , tell him about my project , and he suggests a few ways around the firewall . The Warehouse firewall ? Leena , I think James MacPherson helped me hack into the Warehouse . Tool and Die factory . Why " Tool and Die " ? What is he doing ? I don 't know . Maybe he 's got a new career . He doesn 't exactly strike me as the blue-collar type . All right , this is a German machine , I think . I think they all are . Why would he go to the trouble ... Can I help you ? We 're not open to the public . We 're looking for James MacPherson . There 's no one here by that name . Do you know him ? Who are you ? Secret Service . We 're going to need to look around . Yes , well , by all means , make yourself at home . I hear a loud buzzing . Can you hear it , too ? I can read your lips , but I can 't hear anything you 're saying . I can 't hear anything ! I can 't hear . I can 't hear you . What is going on ? What the hell is going on ? What are you doing ? Okay . All right . Just ... There . You can hear me ? Yeah . Yes ? Yes . All right . God . Artie , what was that Okay ? That was the Goblet of Severan . A Goblet of Severan because , obviously , the Goblet 's in the Warehouse , so there must have been another one that survived . Well , I bet I can guess what it does . Right ? Pete , here , put this glass in your pocket . This was designed by a Roman glassblower in 221 for the Emperor Elagabalus , who was a ridiculously incompetent young man . The only way he could get a room quiet was by using this thing . It emitted a high-pitched sound and brought everyone to their knees . I could have used one of those in high school . Indeed . All right , so why don 't we just ... Let me ... This has that Egyptian symbol on it . The was scepter ? Yes . Maybe Carol 's ... Like this . And now it opens . Always interesting . Hold this . Oh . Hmm . The Phoenix . What What ? It 's the Phoenix . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Here , here , let me see . Let me see . I look great in glasses . Oh , my ... That is amazing . What What is that ? " Starting bid , $ 20 million . " It says that ? Yeah , it 's like a catalogue . But the Phoenix is in the Warehouse . He 's selling it ? $ 20 million , and that 's just the starting . No , he can 't have it . It 's in the Warehouse . That doesn 't make any sense . Why would he sell it ? I mean , he 's not doing this for the money . Yeah , what kind of a villain would ... Listen to me . The Phoenix is in the Warehouse . He doesn 't have it . Well , but even if he did have it , right , he 's not doing this for the money . No , he 's not doing it for the money . He 's doing it for another reason . I just don 't know why . Here , check it . This is too easy . He wants us to find these things . Exactly . Which is what 's making me very , very nervous about following this lead , and making me very nervous about dragging the two of you with me . No , no , no , no , Artie . No , don 't even worry about that . We can actually go ... All right , fine . Yes , now , obviously it 's a trap of some sort , but he would know that I know it 's a trap . So what is he planning , knowing that I know he knows ? Guys , this ... This has the date , time and address of the auction , and it 's today . The auction is today . Is she certain ? She claims that MacPherson was posing as Joshua 's professor . That 's how he made his initial contact . She 's very upset . Where is she now ? At the BB . Your bodyguard 's keeping an eye on her . What is it ? I 've just always felt that she was out of tune . Something hovering . I just could never tell what exactly . This is troubling . Do you think that he could still be using her somehow ? Yes ? MacPherson claims to have the Phoenix . The Phoenix is in the Warehouse . I know . I 'll get back to you . Now I 'm getting angry . I told him the Phoenix was gone . He was genuinely surprised and distraught , and then he told me about the Goblet of Severan . Well , here it is , safe and sound . Open it , please . Okay . That 's not possible . He can 't possibly have access to Warehouse things unless ... Yes . These new video displays record access , do they not ? Hang on . There 's my access of just a few moments ago . Let me just toggle back to see the last person . MacPherson certainly knows how to pick his spots . Mrs. Frederic . Go ahead , I 'll catch up . I feel like Custer walking into Little Bighorn . If he wanted us dead , he 's had several opportunities . This ? This is about something else . All right . Well , what ? Okay , this is the place . This is the time . There 's nothing here . Hey , guys , the Phoenix and the Goblet of Severan , Mrs. Frederic says they 've been taken from the Warehouse . And she seemed shaken . Mrs. Frederic seemed shaken ? Yeah . That is so not comforting . Oh , great . Great . So what do we do now ? Just wait for MacPherson to drop a net on us ? If he 's ahead of us , we can 't see him . We 're going to have to follow the trail he leaves until we can see him . And we watch each other 's backs . What ? Good afternoon . Huh . Do you see that ? Did the boy cause this ? Artie . Artie , you still got those glasses ? Good idea . You know , I think I may ... Oh , I thought I knew what these were . This is ... But they 're not the originals . He replicated Timothy Leary 's reading glasses . But why ? Check these out . The guy who gave us LSD ? Yeah , Dr. Leary experimented with a lot of different ways to see beyond what our brains are capable of seeing . Okay , can I see those , please ? You know , the originals , when you put them on , you never want to take them off . Tell me about it . Artie ? Yeah . That wooden box , can I see that ? Thank you . Fancy . James always did have a flair for the dramatic . Ladies first . What ? Uh ... Yeah , age before beauty . What ? He 's older than me . He 's older than both of us put together . All right , shut up . Hold that . Children . I 'm working with children . Hand that to me . Be careful . Here . Okay , don 't tilt it . I 've got my lunch in there . Lower . Okay , I got it . These are Warehouse 13 crates . Okay , it 's really bad again . What is Your vibe ? Yeah . About ... Yes . Well , when did you get it again ? As soon as we walked in here . It just kicked me in the gut . Well , are you sure ? Yeah , that 's why I 'm telling you . Yeah , but you can 't tell him unless you 're positive . Okay , okay , stop . Stop . What are you talking about ? What vibe ? About me ? Yeah . What about me ? Look , I don 't know . Artie , man , I hate this . Just tell me exactly what you 're feeling . It 's nothing . I mean , I don 't know yet . Look , Artie , all I know is I 've got a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach . When you get a really specific feeling , just let me know , will you ? You 'll be the first . Okay , look , down here . See ? Yeah . I 'm going to go down there alone . Yes . And I want you guys to go back around that way . I think it meets up around the other side . No , no , no . No , Artie . Artie . Artie , no . We shouldn 't split up . Look , if he really is planning an ambush , don 't you think it 's best that we 're not all caught up in it ? He does have a point . He has a point . Artie . Keep your Tesla handy . I 'm fine . Go . I don 't want to tell you anything more about it , gentlemen , because I prefer not to have any competition in the bidding . But it is all true . We were there . Everything Mr. MacPherson talked about ... I 've seen it with my own eyes . In the ashes , to survive the blast of a furnace . And seeing truly is believing , wouldn 't you say , gentlemen ? Thank you all so much for joining me here today . Mr. Pak , how are your ears ? A little better ? How 's your vibe now ? Not good . Not good . As Mr. MacPherson has told you all ... What 's he doing ? I don 't know . The price of this particular item is starting at 20 million U.S. Currency . Okay , possibilities . Artie knocked MacPherson out and is pretending to take his place . Yeah , but they knew him . They called him Mr. Nielsen . No , MacPherson has some kind of mind control over Artie . Well , that 's a strange way to use it . Well ... Okay , Pete , what if Artie 's trading in 30 years at the Warehouse for $ 20 million ? Or ... Snap . What ? Artie is MacPherson . Uh , no , come on . You don 't actually believe that , do you ? Hold it right there , buddy . Yeah , yeah . Stay there until we figure this out . Cut it out , you two . That 's not me . I 'm me . Well , how are we supposed to know that ? Look . Security cameras . So ? He 's setting me up . I mean , he tried to do it a few weeks ago with the Honjo Masamune . You don 't remember ? He went after the sword , plus he dug up my past . I was arrested for treason . This time , he 's going to make sure it sticks . And that must be why Mrs. Frederic sounded so strange . So , what , did he go out and get an Artie suit ? Huh ? How do we know that you 're not him pretending to be you ? The Thimble . You really did read the whole manual , didn 't you ? I did . What thimble ? Harriet Tubman 's Thimble . She wore it as she stitched the rags of her fellow slaves . It became imbued with her dream of a better life , and it developed properties of light refraction so that people saw an image different from the image of the person wearing the thimble . It came in very handy for the Underground Railroad during the Civil War . All right , well , let 's just go in and blast them . No , no , no , no , no . No , he 's expecting that . Well , what 's he not expecting ? This ... I didn 't ... No . No , there 's no way . There 's absolutely no ... Claudia . Claudia . Leena , Mrs. Frederic , this place is my home . I would never do anything to hurt any of you , least of all Artie . We know you wouldn 't , not on purpose . What does that mean ? Do you think he put some kind of bug in my brain or something ? There are any number of methods to create sleeper agents . Apparently , MacPherson has amassed quite a collection of Warehouse artifacts . Then torture me ! You people do that . You 've got to have some kind of truth serum laying around here somewhere . Pump me full of it . Read me . Read my colors , tell my fortune , whatever it is you do . You can tell , right ? Yes , I can . And I have . Claudia , I 'm sorry , but something is wrong . Oh , my God . I 'm like the freaking Manchurian Candidate or something . What the hell ! Let her go . For the time being , it 's best if she weren 't in the Warehouse . What if she disappears ? She 's being watched . I have never seen her this upset before . That 's what made James such an excellent agent . He 'd get inside your head , throw you off your game . Just when you thought you had the upper hand , he 'd strike . $ 48 million going once , going twice ... Sold for $ 48 million to Mr. Pak . And when I get confirmation that the money is in our account , then the Phoenix will be yours . Wrong again , Arthur . Remember these ? Gentlemen , this next item is something that we went through a great deal of trouble to acquire . Edgar Allan Poe 's notebook and his pen . Together , they give their owner the unique ability to make what they write actually happen . What is that ? It 's a fire alarm . We must get out of here . There 's no need to panic . Mr. Nielsen , I 'd rather not be here when the authorities arrive . Excellent point . Next time , Mr. Nielsen . Gentlemen , you don 't ... Federal agents ! Don 't bother . I 'm sorry you went to all that trouble getting Poe 's pen . I guess you wasted your time attacking my family . Okay , pal , time for you to finally get yours . Just don 't kill him . He 's an excellent bodyguard . I 'd hate to lose him . Then who the hell ... James MacPherson , you 're under arrest . Aren 't you adorable ? You didn 't really think it was going to be that easy , did you ? Do you remember our old friend Erik ? He made those wonderful implosion grenades which I demonstrated for you a few weeks ago . Before his untimely death , I had him bring back yet another old favorite , the Eggshell Bomb . This time with a pinch of promethium . If the slightest pressure cracks the shell , it results in a small nuclear reaction . Small , but dazzling . Carson . Now , you two drop those little toys of yours Or Arthur will lose his footing . Thank you . Jaw getting tired , Arthur ? Won 't be long now . You were a Warehouse agent . What the hell happened to you ? Fifteen years of exile . And now I want to give Arthur back the gift he gave me , but unfortunately , you 're going to be tried for your crimes posthumously . In your soul , you believe as I do . That 's the vibe you 've been feeling . How do you know what I 'm feeling ? Because I know you , Peter Lattimer , better than you know yourself . I was you . Shall I tell you the thought that crosses your mind occasionally ? What if these artifacts really do belong out in the world instead of being locked up by a gang of autocratic Regents who see the universe through the blindness of their own bureaucracy ? Walk out of here with me now and follow what you know to be true in your soul . That 's a nice speech . It sounds even better with the fancy accent . But it still doesn 't cover the fact that you are out of your gourd , MacNuttypants . You put a bomb in a man 's mouth . Not really a great recruiting tool . Fair enough . Well , I 'll be saying goodbye , then . What , do you expect us to just let you walk out of here ? No , no . I expect you to die while you 're trying to save Arthur . And I 'd say he 's got about 30 seconds . Hey , Mac ! Good catch . So we 're never turning him in to the government ? The government ? No , I don 't think so . He 's already proven that prisons can 't hold him . So then what happens to him ? I mean , we 're not going to , you know ... No , no , no , no . Although he would happily kill all of us without blinking an eye . No , we don 't operate like that . We 'll put him in the Bronze Sector . Arthur , I 'm honored . Okay , look , I promise to read the manual this weekend , but what is the Bronze Sector ? Actually , I don 't remember that being in the manual . Bronze Sector , children , is where the most dangerous people in history have been ... What 's the generous phrase ? Preserved . Yes , preserved . People whose removal from society had to be certain , they 're put in the Bronze Sector . Locked for all eternity in Warehouse 13 . How poetic . Even a twisted mind can be an artifact . Let 's go . Aren 't you forgetting something ? Not that I can think of . My blood . If I remember correctly , my veins will burst upon entry . I say we give it a try , see what happens . James , what a bittersweet reunion . You 've aged . Mrs. Frederic , you haven 't . You must tell me your secret . Perhaps on a warm summer day over tea . Perhaps not . All this time you 've had them . How simple . I wish I 'd thought of it . What are those ? Crystalline diamonds with a trace of palladium . Palladium ? Yeah , it neutralizes the minerals in his blood . So he doesn 't go kablooey . Unfortunately . Wow . That is a load off my mind . Goodbye , James . Yeah , let 's go . Let 's go . So why is the Bronze Sector not in the manual ? No , no , no , it 's far too dangerous for there to be a written record . If someone were to find this place , somehow reverse the process ... The point is , we don 't want these people out in the world . So this place is filled with , like , the worst guys ever , right ? Hitler , Mussolini , Michael Vick ? No , no , these are men and women who would have become Hitlers and Mussolinis . Or worse , except we got to them first . A room filled with evil that you 've never heard of . It seems so unfair . No , this is a process that was first explored in ... Mesopotamia . In 1230 BC ... Uh , ' 50 . 1250 BC . Anyway , the bronzing process was too heavy , and it kind of cracked open . Let 's just say it was unsuccessful . Here , what we do is we flash-freeze the bodies cryogenically and we preserve them by bronzing . Unfortunately , it 's a painless process . Really ? How many times have you tried it ? It 's about as painful as a sword in the chest . Touche . What a beautiful creature . A farewell gift , Arthur ? You shouldn 't have . Just ignore the monster in the cage . Pete and Myka , the stolen artifacts have been loaded in . Can I get your help replacing them ? Fine by me . I 'd rather not see this . Wait . Come on , I want to watch this . When 's the next time something like this is going to happen ? Hopefully never . Who says you can never go home again , eh , Arthur ? James . You know , I thought I 'd have a lot more to say to you . Goodbye , James . Arthur , we can still be partners . Pleading for your life , that 's out of character for you . I 'm not pleading for my life . I 'm pleading for yours . You know , maybe I should go check on Artie . I 'm sure he 's fine . You know what ? I 'll go check . I 'll be back in a second . Okay . What a waste . Downtown , baby How she looks so ... Turn around . My dear , thank you for remembering our appointment . That is a relief . Wave to Arthur so he can enjoy the tape later . We 're clear . You won 't be needing that anymore . So was it all worth it ? Unfettered access to Warehouse 13 ? Time will tell . Hmm . There 's work to be done . The codes I implanted when Arthur tried to access my site need to be activated . Go on , now . Tempus fugit . Late as usual . How did you ... Get away from there ! Or what ? You 've had your chance , Arthur . So many chances . Go ahead , fire it . You see , there 's a way around almost anything , partner . No ! Artie . Artie ? Artie , are you okay ? Artie , hey ! Can you hear me ? Artie , get up ! Artie ! Artie . Artie , get up . Artie , get up . Pete , hurry ! Look out , look out . No . No . No , no , no . Artie ! Wait , wait , wait ! Wait for us ! James ! Self-destruct sequence initiated . The umbilicus will self-destruct in five , four , three , two , one .

 God , it 's cold . Gettin' too damn old for this . Make sure that blast cap 's on tight . It 's not the blast cap I 'm worried about , it 's my damn fingers . Stop your complaining . We fall behind schedule , we violate our permit . Just a minute . Almost there . Zone one clear . Zone two clear . Zone three clear . Zone four clear . Got a squatter in zone five . Getting him out . After that , we 're clear here , too . Zone six clear . Okay , people . Building 's clean . Wrap it up and get out . We 're go for demolition in three minutes . T-minus three minutes . So what 's up , man ? Stateside diner , meatloaf sandwich ? Thinking steak and eggs at cora 'S . Well , we could always head up route nine to parkview . - Sure . - What ? " What . " The waitress . The brunette . What 's her name ? Oh , marcie ? No , I wasn 't even- - I was thinking about the lean corned beef . Yeah , right , the lean corned beef named marcie . Hold up . What 's the matter ? You okay ? Dennis . What 's the problem ? Nothing . I don 't know . - You swept it , right ? - Sure . I just ... I don 't know . All of a sudden I got a weird feeling . Yeah ? Me too . Mine 's called , " I don 't wanna die looking at dennis . " Come on , man . Hey , radio mike , will ya ? Tell him I wanna do another sweep . Come on , man , where you going ? Dennis , they 're holding the countdown for us . Damn it ! Come on . Where we going ? I think we missed something . The plans show another room over here . Ahh , this doesn 't make sense . Phil , you got dennis ? What 's going on ? We don 't have a lot of time . Just two more minutes . We 'll be right out . - Do you hear that ? - What ? Sounds hollow . Come on , man , this place has been completely prepped . There 's nothing underneath there , just solid foundation . Does that sound solid to you ? It 's probably just frost damage . The--the concrete 's cracked . Mike , I think you should come down here . This is definitely not * * * * . God , and what 's that smell ? What do you think this was ? I don 't know , but it 's old . Well , good , that narrows it down . What the hell ? Oh , my god . Fringe Season01 Episode15 Inner Child Ella ? Mommy gets grumpy if I wake her too early . She always did . Mm , come on . Well , do you want some ... pancakes ? - Yes . - Yeah ? * * * * * * * Francis . Hey , jim . How are you , buddy ? I saw that your mayor got himself into a little bit of trouble . That couldn 't have been fun for you guys . When ? Has anyone taken anything from that fax in the last five minutes ? I 'll call you back . YOU ARE * * * * * * * * Ugh , liv , I 'm sorry . I told her to let you sleep late . Oh , she did until 6 : 17 . - Yup , that sounds late for her . - Which one ? Uh , the yellow one . - Aunt liv ? - Definitely the yellow . Did you tell her ? Go get dressed . What ? We went apartment hunting yestery . Really ? You 're thinking of moving to boston ? Yeah , well , ella loves it here , and so do I , so ... Well , you know that you can stay here for as long as you want . I know , but you don 't need a little creature waking you up at 6 : 17 every morning . If that little creature is ella , I am fine with it . - Hello . - It 's me . The artist is back . How do you know ? Did we receive another fax ? Yeah . Hartford office got one too . Well , did we get a trace ? Said from a copy store in allston . So I 've got mason and louis headed over to question the employees , see if someone can give us a description of whoever sent it . Okay , I 'm gonna be there in 15 minutes . - Some new horrifying event you 're not allowed to tell me about ? - Yeah . Okay , now it 's gonna be 14 . Excuse me , agent dunh ? Get the bishops . I need you to meet me at children 's hospital . Actually , I just had an old case reopened , and I- - It can wait . * * * * * * After the boy was found , construction crews performed a search of the tunnels . It was determined they 'd beenen sealed shut for at least 70 years . The place was a sarcophagus . The only living things down there were rats , insects ... and him . And we have no idea how he got down there ? He 's so pale . He seems to be developing some pigmentation . Well , he probably hasn 't seen sunlight in years . Does he have a name ? He hasn 't spoken a word since he was found . - Dr. Bishop , any thoughts ? - Perhaps . But first I need a piece of special equipment . My turntable . Is that some kind of lab equipment ? No , a turntable . Record player . You enjoy music , don 't you , mr . Broyles ? Well , imagine the agony of having an extensive record collection , and having no means to play it . The agony . I 'll have someone get right on that . This is dr . Winnik.Chief of p Look , I understand your agency 's taken an interest in this child , but he 's been through quite a trauma . Is he sick ? Not as far as we can tell , but he 's having difficulty breathing . - We need to administer oxygen . - No , don 'T . No no no . I wouldn 't do that . You said the tunnel was sealed , is that correct ? Well , then it 's obvious that the child was trapped in a low-oxygen environment for so long that his body adapted to it . And that is why he 's having trouble breathing . I don 't think so . Unless you have an iq higher than mine , I 'm not interested in what you think . Administering additional oxygen at this stage would simply cause his lungs to fill with fluid and drown him where he lies . We need to deprive him of oxygen . Get him a nasal cannula and a tank with low oxygen content . Perhaps 5 % to start . * * * * * * A griffin . 'Scuse me ? Your tattoo . The body of a lion and the head of an eagle . That 's a griffin , right ? Just picked it outta the sample book . Thought it looked cool . Oh , well . A nice choice . Did it hurt much ? I always imagined getting a tattoo would hurt real bad . It 's a good pain . - I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to embarrass you or any- - - You didn 'T . Do you need a hand ? Uh , thanks , I got it . Um , actually , you know , a little help would great . Cool motorcycle . What make ? '67 harley shovelhead . She 's a beauty . Yeah , she is . Any minute , now . It worked . You 'll want to increase the oxygen flow by 10 % every hour ' til he acclimates . So you said that he hasn 't talked . How do we know he can hear ? He responds to sound . And we examined his timpanic membrane ; there 's no physical damage . In fact , considering how he was found , he seems fairly healthy . His heart sounds fine , his blood pressure 's strong . And how do we think he survived down there ? I mean , what did he eat ? Rats . I 'd think . Moss insects . High in protein . Tastier than you may think , especially millipedes . Although they all lack certain minerals which may account for his follicular dilemma . His baldness . Have you performed a urinalysis ? We haven 't been able to . We 've been feeding him intravenously . He hasn 't relieved himself since he arrived . Can 't say I blame him for not wanting to try this . This looks worse than the dreadful food they served at st . Clare 'S . You were on staff at st . Clare 's asylum ? No , no , no , not a medical doctor . I was a patient . Got such a sense of humor , huh ? Walter , what do ya say we keep those old st . Clare 's stories to ourself , yeah ? Hello . My name 's olivia . What 's yours ? It 's my phone . It 's charlie . I 'm , uh , still in the hospital . You won 't remember this , peter , but you didn 't talk much either , as a child . Could you get me the address ? - What 's it say ? - Sam gilmore . He cawrite ? Is that your name ? I 'll see what we have on any sam gilmores in massachusetts . The body was found just after 6 : 00 pm . This part of the park 's usually empty this time of the year . Couple of kids were using it as a shortcut when they found her . Definitely the work of the artist . He clearly made alterations to the body post mortem , and put her out here for the whole world to see . Here 's what we have so far . She 's a local girl . A process server from weston . Next of kin is being notified by local agents as we speak . Samantha gilmore . Wait , did you say sam gilmore ? Yeah . Samantha gilmore . You know her ? Our perp 's name is the artist . Now , some of you here may recal that we had our first encounter with him three years ago . He killed four women in lower jamaica plain over a period of two days . After the fourth murder he stopped . - Are you holding for dr . Winnik ? - Uh , yes . Samantha gilmore , age 24 . Now , the killing bears all of the artist 's trademarks . His M.O.Is to kidnap , sedate , and kill his victims . Then after he kills them , using surgical tools and chemicals , he , in his mind , enhances their appearance . In this case he bleached her skin , removed multiple piercings , and dyed her hair . - * * * * * * * * - Thanks . It was preceded with a faxed invitation to view new work - that was to be displayed somewhere in public . - Anything yet ? No . That was the hospital . They 're giving the boy an mri . When he 's done I 'm gonna go in and talk to him again . In the meantime I 've sent his picture to samantha gilmore 's friends and family , but , so far , no one recognizes him . You didn 't really expect that they would , did you ? No . So let me ask you the obvious . What 's the connection ? Amala and kamala , the wolf girls of india . And--and , ah ... marie-gelique memmie leblanc , the wild girl of champagne . They 're all feral children who- - who grew up completely isolated from human contact , surviving , like our boy , uh , for many years alone . Yeah , but I 'm guessing none of them could write upside-down . You 're saying that the boy grew up down there . Well , based on the blood work , yes . I 'm fairly certain that the lack of vitamin d , for one , but also the complete absence of lactobacillus- - Microorganisms that help us digest . They 're everywhere . Precisely.If the boy had spent any time above the ground , then he certainly would have absorbed those . But that still doesn 't explain how he got there in the first place . You said that the place had been sealed off for decades . The boy couldn 't be more than ten . Well , he certainly looks that . You believe he might be older . Well , given the environmental conditions- - the lack of oxygen and light- - and their impact on his biological development , he could be significantly older . But none of that explains how he knew samantha gilmore . No . That I can 't explain . But good news , mr . Broyles . I have located my turntatable . So I don 't need you to purchase me one after all . It was under the sink in the john . So obvious.I was sitting on the toilet , and I - - Walte I think that 's probably enough information . - Agent dunham . We just got another one . The artist is going after another victim . * * * * * * - That 's a beautiful dog . - Thank you . - Is he friendly ? - Of course . His name 's mack . Hey , mack . Hey , mackie . They , uh ... they told me that you haven 't eaten anything solid yet . So I , uh ... I thought that you might like these more than the mystery meat . When I was a kid , I used to live on these . Except the yellow . Something about the color . Reminded me of medicine . You wanna try one ? That 's it . Good . Thank you . Yesterday you wrote down a name for me . Remember ? I thought today you could give me your name . You have a real way with him . Elliot michaels . Department of social services . Uh , olivia dunham , fbi . Um , you mind if I borrow miss dunham for a few minutes ? I promise I 'll bring her right back . I 'll be just outside . Dr. Winnik brought me up to speed about your interest in the boy 's case . The circumstances by which he was found attracted our interest . It 's bizarre , huh ? Have you been able to find out anything more about him ? You know , first name , where he 's from ... Uh , no . I 'm afraid not yet . Well , I 'm not gonna get in your way . I just thought I 'd stop by and see him before I g the ball rolling . - How so ? - How so ? Uh , well , you know- - physically , it- - it doesn 't seem as if there 's anything really wrong with him , - so I 've arranged to have him moved . - Moved ? To a facility that can provide the treatment he needs . - When ? - Tomorrow . You know , I hope . Assuming all the paperwork is in order . - What 's wrong ? - Uh , I 'm not sure . His bp and his heart rate are spiking . It 's okay , it 's okay . It 's okay . It 's gonna be okakay . * * * * * * * * I-I think we 're okay . You okay , there ? Maybe if you just , uh , gave us a moment . - Of course . Just take your time . - Thank you . I 'm at the hospital . I think we may have found another one . I should let you get some rest . * * * * * * Anything so far ? I just got here five seconds ago . So what 's the plan ? Start knocking on doors ? Unless you can think of a better idea . All right . You go east , I take west . - Good . - You are very good . Mind some company ? Of course not . Did I miss you last night , or did you not even come home ? Uh , no . You didn 't miss me . Have you eaten anything ? Uh , mms . Liv ... do you like it ? Your job ? Yeah . Most days . Today , not so much . I followed a lead that didn 't pan out . What about you ? Why are you up ? I 'm sorry . - Hello . - We found our second victim . It 's kate harper . Where ? She 's right outside st . Catherine 'S . Surrounded by candles . Good news is we might have finally caught a break . E.R.T.Said they found some blood underneath her nails . - So they 're running it . - Okay . I 'll be right in . Just one more thing , liv . The address the boy gave us . Little while after we left , a neighbor found a dog tied to a fence . It was whimpering . It was the victim 's dog . We were there . There 's no way we could 've known , liv . But he was trying to tell us , and he was right , and we were there ? WalteR . Olivia 's here . She needs to talk to ya . Walter . Could she come back later ? I 'm about to step in the bath . No , she can 't come back later . It 's the middle of the night . Shneeds to talk to you right now . Honestly , peter , can 't a man get a- - agent dunham . Peter , why didn 't you tell me agent dunham was here ? I 'm pretty sure I did . Well , what can I do for you ? Walter , it turns out the boy was right . He gave me a clue , but I didn 't know what I was looking for . So do you have any thoughts at all ? Any idea how I can reach him or how he 's doing any of this ? I-I believe I know how he 's doing it . Since he 's been living underground for so long , his hypersensitivity to light and sound- - it 's just possible he may also be sensitive to people 's emotions . A raw nerve . Able to intuit the feelings and intentions of others . Your killer , for one . So are you saying that he 's psychic ? No , no . More a shark . A shark ? Specifically , their electromagnetic field , which allows them to detect their prey 's bioelectric field from a distance of many miles . We humans have it too , of course . Pheromones . Undetectable chemicals that nonetheless affect our behavior , our sex drive- - Hey , speaking of sex drive . Oh , peter , don 't be such a prude . I 'm sure agent dunham knows what a penis looks like . Don 't you , agent dunham ? My father , ladies and gentlemen . But how would he know things that I don 't ? Know about the killer or victims that he 's never even met ? My dear , there is much that is unexplained . Until it is . In short , he has no idea . Even if you 're right , and he can sense the killer , he can 't tell me that . Not in a way that I could do anything about it . Well , if that 's the problem , then there 's no problem . What does that mean ? Well , the boy is obviously thinking , yes ? Having thoughts . We just haven 't beenble to hear them . And I 'm sure you can do that , can 't you ? Hear his thoughts . Perhaps I can . Did you make this ? Listen , I wanna take you away from here for a while . Is that okay ? Vintage bugs bunny . Didn 't get any better than this , right ? I found it ! Neural stimulator . Is there anything it can 't do ? Walter , is that what you 're gonna use to read the boy 's thoughts ? Not to read them , my dear . To listen to them . I wish you would have told us that that 's what you were gonna use . - Why ? - ' Cause you coulda saved us the hassle . You 're not putting that medieval torture device on that poor kid . Walter , the last time you used that thing , you drilled it to the guy 's head . If you think he 'll find it disagreeable ... - I suppose it could be modified . - Really ? You didn 't think to mention that to the last guy ? It shouldn 't be too much trouble . We merely need to intercept the neural responses from the speech centers of the boy 's brain , which can be achieved by placing electrodes in the halo ring . After that , it 's simply a matter of synthesizing the impulses . Think of it as creating artificial vocal cords . Simple . Like making ' an omelet . Actually , son , a good omelet is far more complex . We 'll have him talking in no time . Where 's the child thatas in this room ? - He was discharged . - By whom ? Just remember that you don 't have to do anything that you don 't wanna do . If for a second you 're scared , or you don 't like what 's happening , you just squeeze my hand like that . Okay ? Is he ready ? As ready as he 'll ever be . I guess . I 've seen that look before . Usually right before somebody throws up . Agent farnsworth , ready ? Walter , what 're you doing ? Watch and learn , son . - Nicely done , walter . - Thank you . You can turn the music off now , agent farnsworth . What 's wrong ? What 's going on in here ? Did you really think you could just steal a child out of protective custody and that somehow no one would notice ? Look , first of all , I didn 't steal him . The child 's assisting us in an active criminal investigation . Assisting you how ? No offense , mr . Michaels , but that 's classified information . The department of social services doesn 't have clearance to know that . - What ? - Mr. Michaels isn 't social services . He 's with the cia 's directorate of science and technology . I 'd ve told you earlier myself , but you don 't have clearance to know that . This morning we were informed the D. S.N.T.Will be taking full custody of the child . So they can what ? Study him ? This child was apparently able to survive for years , underground , in an oxygen-deprived environment with no food or water . Surely you could see how someone who doesn 't have his best interests at heart might want to exploit that . Oh , so you wanna take him to protect him , is that it ? Forgive me for sounding harsh , but I don 't buy that for a second . Dunham . It 's all right . To be honest , it really doesn 't make any difference what you think- - the boy 's coming with me . I 'm afraid this is above both of us . Agent francis just called . He said we got another invitation from the artist . Mr. Michaels , suppose you give us one day . A day ? He could help us catch a murderer and save a life . The boy would be under my protection . I 'll personally guarantee his safety . If I agree to this , then you 'll turn the boy over to me without a fight ? Do we have an agreement ? We do . My very educated mother just served us nine pies . No . That 's the planets of the solar system- - or at least was . You wanna take a look at this ? His name is roadblock . He 's not really one of your top-tier G.I. Joes , but it is the best we had . It 's funny , I always remember the scar being on the other side . You want him ? Cannot build phallic puzzles in the lab . - What is he doing ? - Mnemonics . You know , like a rhyme or phrase to help memory . Like , uh , " home " stands for the great lakes.That 's huron- - I 'm familiar with it . Why is he doinit ? Well , he is trying to remember which wires go into which connections on the machine . Yeah , thanks , charlie . I will . Keep me posted . More bad news ? We got the forensics report . We were hoping that the blood we found under the second victim 's fingernails was a match for the killer . But no ? Not unless gene is the killer . It wasn 't human , it was bovine . You said cow blood ? Yeah , and some plastic polymers . How would someone get cow 's blood on their fingers in boston ? Astrid , could you contact the bureau of animal health ? We should start pulling livestock licenses around boston . Petting farms , research facilities , anything . - Yeah . Gotcha . - She 's a bad mamma jamma ! Pha , beta , beta and gamma- - she 's a bad mamma jamma . Signal amplification , bifurcation , modulation , juxtaposition . You hanging in there , kiddo ? - Yeah , me too . - Peter , get me the red wires . - Peter . - Here 's a thought . A couple years ago , I was working down in tennessee as a floor sweeper at a meat packing plant . - Sounds awesome . - You have no idea . My point is we had these big rolls of industrial-grade plastic that we used to wrap their cuts of meat in before we would send them to the grocery stores . Cow 's blood in plastic . Yeah . Okay . I believe we 're ready . - Peter . - Yeah . Yes . Listen to that . Listen to what , walter ? That 's just random noise . No , that 's just the computer calibrating the signal to noise ratio . Adjust the attenuation setting to 70 decibels . Okay , that sounds a little more like a voice . Yes , now , the sound pressure level . Eh , dial the audio meter to 1,500 hertz . Slower , damn it , go slower . - Okay , if you wanna do this yourself , feel free . - No , there . Quickly , get me a tape recorder . Walter , turn the machine off right now . Turn it off now . He 's freezing . Help me get this off of him . Y , astrid , can you grab us a blanket ? - All right , free in the front . - Here . All right , we 're gonna get you warmed up . Doesn 't make any sense . If anything , brain activity should generate heat . We 're trying to track down a suspect in a murder investigation . What , you mean the guy on the news ... who killed those girls ? We 're not sure . Maybe . But any past or present employees that stick out to you ? Like antisocial behavior or a history of violent incidences here at work ? No . They 're good men . Hard workers . I 'm gonna need a copy of your employee records , regardless . Okay . And also a sample of your shipping plastic . Plastic ? Why ? It could be an element in our investigation . - Will that be a problem ? - No , but ... Mr. Wu ? A man came in here yesterday , and I--I sold him some plastic . Allow me . Oh , thank you . Your mother raised you well . Hey , peter , it 's me . I 'm just leaving . So , how 's the boy ? Has walter made any progress ? Hard to say ; we heard something , but I don 't know if it was the kid trying to talk . Look , I don 'want you to get upset about this because he is fine , but something kinda weird did happen . Weird how ? Well , he started shivering all of the sudden . Like , the temperature dropped 30 degrees , except it didn 'T . Is he sick ? No , he seems fine . We got him wrapped up in a blanket . He 's doing okay . How ' bout you ? You find anything ? Yeah , looks like the artist bought some plastic from a slaughterhouse in roxbury . I got his sketch , all thanks to you . Hey , guys . We got good news . What 's that ? Turns out the plastic did come from a meat packing plant . Olivia got a sketch of the guy . What about you ? You gonna go back to the fbi , or you coming here ? - Ask her if it was refrigerated . - Hold on a second . Peter ! Ask her if the plant was refrigerated . It 's a meat packing plant full of raw meat . So yeah , let 's go out on a limb here and say that it 's probably refrigerated . What does that even matter ? Because that explains everything . Walter , slow down . You 're not making any sense . Of course I am . The boy- - our strange , little friend- - is an empath . Yes . He senses other people 's emotions . You already said that , walter . Go on , walter , what are you saying ? That he 's capable of making connections- - emotional connections . Uh , to a construction worker who found him , the killer , but most importantly , he is emotionally bonded to you , agent dunham . That 's why he 's telling you about the crimes . Because he knows that the information is important to you . He 's trying to help you . Are you trying to help me ? That man who 's been hurting people is going to hurt someone else unless I stop him . Do you know who he is ? Can you tell me anything about him ? Maybe he doesn 't know . Or he can 't control the ability all the time . Perhaps a small electric shock to kick-start things . No . It 's something different . It 's like he 's mad at me . - Because he doesn 't wanna leave . - What ? Well , you told michaels that once the boy helped you stop the artist , you 'd turn him over to him . He heard you . Or , more accurately , felt you . I 'm sorry.I 've been so caught up in what I needed that I forgot how strange this must seem to you . And I know how scared you must be , but I need your help again . And I can 't even stop them from taking you . Even though I wish I could . And if you really can feel what I 'm thinking ... you know how much I mean that . * * * * * * Thank you . Nice car , sir . Where ya headed ? Uh , home . I was out to dinner . Open the trunk , please . It 's clear . Okay . Thank you . Sorry for the inconvenience . What 's going on , officer ? What are you doing in the neighborhood , sir ? I--just , uh , coming home from work . Haven 't had anything to drink . Would you mind if I ask what you- - what you 're looking for ? Uh , I 'm sorry . We 're not allowed to say . Sir , we need to check the back of your vehicle . Charlie ! Check the back of the van ! Liv , found the victim . She 's alive . - You okay ? - Yeah . Oh , god . This is francis . I need E.M.S.At the cemetery behind the 1600 block of york . Broyles . It 's olivia . I need you to help me with something . Here . Here . And then we just do the blood work , okay ? - Excuse me , dr . Winnik ? - Yes . I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment . Sure . I think you 'll find he 's doing much better . Oh , thank you . You remember d winnik . She 's gonna take you now . But not to a facility . She 's gonna take you to a home . With a very nice family that are gonna take care of you . And keep you safe . We should go now . Bye . What do you mean he 's gone ? I 'm sorry , mr . Michaels . Gone where ? Well , that 's what we can 't figure out . He disappeared from right under the noses of protective detail . How is that possible ? He 's just a kid . Yes . A kid who , as you said yourself , lived his entire life underground , which still begs the question how he got there in the first place . I 'm beginning to suspect there 's a lot about him we don 't understand . And apparently we never will . - You said it ! - No ! I didn 't ! I didn 't say it ! Yes you did , you cheater ! Hi , liv . Mommy is so bad at simon says she won 't even do what I say . Four years old and she 's drunk with power . I have created a monster ! Do you wanna play with us ? Oh , don 't do that . Let aunt liv rest . Sure . - I 'm simon . - Okay . - Simon says put your hands in the air . - Okay . Touch your noses . You lose . Okay , again , again .

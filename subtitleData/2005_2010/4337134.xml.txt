 MALE NARRATOR : Previously on Surface . You 're not Nim ! Miles was bitten by a creature . And now he 's changing . MAN 1 : Mark ! MAN 2 : Jonathan ! But the creatures have attacked others ... Aren 't you coming ? I know what they found . ( CRYING ) ... and killed . Rich and Daughtery presented their evidence to the world . Partly . explain that . I was able to obtain ... Genuine article , huh ? It was very similar to something called a Liopleuridon . I need a signature , ma 'am . Since when do they need a signature for a fax ? ( BANGING ON DOOR ) What are you doing ? MALE NARRATOR : They had to run . LAURA : Oh ! Keep going ! Keep going ! Get outta here ! Go ! LAURA : Rich , that 's the one . That 's the one that was in Cirko 's office . Hmm , that 's the flower . Until , a mysterious scientist contacted them . ELECTRONIC VOICE : If I wanted to harm you I could find easier ways ... What the hell is that ? It 's us . Who is she ? Does she have the answers ? AII ready ? Ready as we 're ever gonna be . We thought it was understood . The invitation was for Dr. Daughtery only . And now , Surface continues . ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO ) Hey . Listen , honey , I 'm really sorry I didn 't call , but I just ... I didn 't think it 'd be very safe . It 's so good to see you . Did you see us on MSNBC ? Yeah . You and the other woman . Now , honey , I told you it wasn 't like that . You went down into a submarine with her . I 'm not stupid . A submersible ... Honey , these things are incredible , okay ? The size of them ... I mean , you couldn 't imagine it . But you saw the program , right ? You saw them because they were on there . Who are you ? Ed BIagman . Who 's he ? I 'm not trying to ... I 'm not talking to you ! What 's he doing here ? This is my house ! Your house ? My house . Your family ? You just left us . I didn 't leave anybody . I told you exactly ... Who is this guy ? He 's my divorce lawyer . We 're offering a reward of $ 10,000 . $ 10,000 . They killed my son . We 're offering a reward . Thanks . Are you all right ? 10,000 bucks in the off-season ? It 's gonna be a war zone . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) caitlin 's saving me a seat , unless you want it . No . I 'm fine here . Okay . SHERIFF : ( ON MICROPHONE ) Okay , take your seats , please . ( FEEDBACK ON MICROPHONE ) Come on , people . Well , it 's good to see so many concerned citizens here today ... Yeah , well , I 'm concerned . I 'm concerned I 'm gonna get my ass bit off every time I check my crab traps . ( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) It 's not a joke , Burt . You see me laughing ? MAYOR : Sit down , Burt . Let him talk . We hear you got one at the aquarium . MAN 1 : Yeah , what about that ? ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) Look , everyone please . Quiet ! We 've got a lot to cover , and I 'll need to have some order here . You want order ? You got to level with us . MAN 2 : Yeah ! You got one or not ? ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) We have a specimen . Whether it 's the same species we 're looking for we can 't be sure at this point . ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING ) Eggs ! Washed up on WrightsviIIe Beach . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) A week ago , we lost a son there , my wife and I. He was swimming at that beach , just like I do and just like you do and just like all our children do . And what have they done ? Nothing ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) Bastards ! Now , I don 't know about you , but I 'm not gonna sit around here and wait for more of these things to wash into town and hatch . ( FEEDBACK FROM MICROPHONE ) MAN 3 : Turn that off ! The gifted few . What ? I 'm sorry ? " Most scientists are narrow-minded , dull " and just plain stupid . " James Watson , right ? Of Watson-Crick ? He was right . Then there are the gifted few . Those who , despite their hubris and contempt for received opinion , do the heavy lifting , make the real breakthroughs . Do you take sugar ? Yes , thank you . I was going to be one of those . I was going to save the world . Instead ... How did it happen ? Money , of course . They appealed to my vanity . That was my mistake . ( STAMMERING ) They who ? They gave me everything I wanted . Funds , freedom , unlimited resources . Yeah , but who 's the " they " ? I received my doctorate in 2000 , arguably the most important year in the history of science . The year Venter sequenced the human genome . It was a thrilling time , a paradigm shift , and everyone in genomics knew it . We were going to unlock the secrets of how life began . " congratulations on conferraI of your doctorate . " We would Iike to discuss your academic research " and propose an extraordinary employment opportunity . " First in your class . Magna . published two articles in Nature . Impressive . But let 's be frank . There are a Iot of impressive people in laboratories all over the world . At our firm , we 're interested in the level beyond . Men and women with the capacity of becoming a kepler , a Heisenberg , an Einstein . I 'm flattered . But what firm do you represent ? We are primarily a genomics firm , made up of Iike-minded scientists willing to work beyond the commonly accepted frontiers of genetics . What do you mean by frontiers ? Frontiers of knowledge , of technique , of societal conceptions of morality . Your graduate thesis on stimulating the neurotransmitters was just the kind of work we admire . only lacked one thing . And what was that ? The opportunity to test your theories on a thousand test subjects . That would 've taken money . unlimited resources and unwavering support . We provide both . This is dolly , the sheep that was supposedly cloned in 1996 . An impressive first , if it had been first . We cloned our first sheep in the early 1960s . You cloned a sheep in the 1960s ? And gibbons and pandas . And the infamous archaeopteryx . The archaeopteryx is extinct . ( CAWING ) We assumed a kind of custodial attitude toward the biosphere . ( ARCHAEOPTERYX CAWING ) Now I know this is a Iot to process . ( STUTTERING ) I don 't understand . Who pays for all this ? The firm has a vast library of patents , mostly medical , that funds a substantial endowment . We 'd Iike to make you part of the firm . Our only two requirements are confidentiality and a permanent commitment . Permanent ? employees commit for a lifetime . In exchange , we offer whatever salary you require . well , I ... I require a Iot . Fine . ( SCOFFING ) I should 've added a zero . I went to work the next day . Everything I had been promised was true . But there were other drawbacks . The corporation is extremely private . employees work alone . There 's no last names . socializing is forbidden . There 's frequent rotation to other facilities around the world ... I mean , that sounds like a terrorist cell . infinitely more cautious than that . And all this for the money ? This isn 't about the money . That 's not their agenda . And what is the ... What is the agenda ? There 's the rub . Each scientist is given their own specific focus , one that precludes a larger sense of the whole . Now , I built the carburetor , but I never saw the car . But you must 've had some idea . Over time , I had my theories . That 's why I contacted you . " When the stars threw down their spears , " And watered heaven with their tears , " Did He smile His work to see ? " Did He who made the Iamb make thee ? " ( GASPING ) ( TRAFFIC HUMMING ) You all right ? She said what ? She said the species are man-made . ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ) Man-made ? Yeah , genetically engineered . Like moId-resistant wheat . Hang on a second now . ( SIGHING ) You 're telling me a person created these things ? Who ? Deja vu all over again ? You and your friend pulling an egg out of the water . That 's how this all started , right ? Yeah . That 's how it started . JARED : Dr. bloom ! Take a look . Creepshow . Looks contagious . BLOOM : miles , get me a cooler , will you ? miles , what are you doing ? killing them . They take over everything . ( RAIN PATTERING ) Do you realize how incredible this is ? I mean , there 's maybe , maybe , two dozen people in the entire world who understand the true possibilities of genomics . And clearly this firm knows how to recombine DNA . It 's mind-bIowing . ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO ) What ? ( LAUGHING ) It just kills me . AII this time I thought it was something holy and here it is , it 's just some egghead in a lab somewhere . Yeah , you know ... Boy , I thought I was chosen , you know ? So did she . Yeah , but ... See , she didn 't lose her family over it . That 's the thing . while you were out there , I went home , I saw Tracy . ( CLEARING THROAT ) ( SIGHING ) She wants a divorce . Rich , man , I 'm sorry . I really am . Do you need to go back ? ( SIGHING ) No . No . If I quit now , then it 'd really be for nothing , so let 's just keep going , all right ? So let 's talk about this and figure it out . You said that ... Now she said that every member of this outfit had a part to play , right ? Yeah . Okay . But then none of them knew the entire design ? Hmm . Yeah , but that 's ridiculous . Somebody had to know the entire design , huh ? No , I don 't know . I don 't think she knew . But , I mean ... Someone designed it . So ... Oh , gosh , I can figure this out . How ? That 's the first rule of the insurance biz , man . You follow the money . RICH : Okay , she said they funded medical patents , right ? LAURA : Try Oxidase Inhibitor . Okay . The woman said that this secret corporation worked on it in the ' 60s . SSRI 's . Which are what ? selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , like anti-depressants . You know , happy pills . Got it , okay . well , it 's asking for an active ingredient . Right , try phenchIoramine . Which is ? The actual name for Nortide . What , the anti-depressant ? The anti-depressant is right . The corporation developed it . Okay , the original patent was filed December , ' 63 . timeline 's right . By who ? What ? It 's been redacted . How is the source patent for an anti-depressant classified ? When someone with sway doesn 't want to get traced . AII right , well , hey , that means we 're on the right track , right ? So , who makes Nortide ? Lorentec . As in the world 's biggest pharmaceutical company ? Yeah . Go ahead , spill it . What ? A week ago you 're all hot and heavy with caitlin , and today you 're staring into an empty incubation tank . Go ahead . Ask . I 'm an expert on women . Look , thanks , but ... Come on , dude . It 's psychology 101 . You can 't keep things all bottled up . You got to talk it out . Okay , but , dude , it 's a total secret . She 's pregnant . No , no , no , nothing like that . It 's me and Nim . Observation . I 'm asking you about a woman , and you 're talking about an unclassified marine vertebrate , which is in itself a warning sign . But go ahead . Okay . You know how Nim zaps things ? Like , electrically ? admittedly , that 's weird . Yeah , well ... I do it , too . You zap things . Yeah . Something very strange is happening to me . It 's called puberty , dude . No , no , that 's not it . ( STAMMERING ) I zap things , man . I can 't control it . It just happens sometimes . ( STAMMERING ) It 's like I 'm connected , not only to Nim , but to the other ones , Iike I 'm part of them . And sometimes , it 's like I can hear what they 're thinking , and it 's driving me crazy . Oh , I get it now . A jokester , huh ? You had me going there for a second . But , you know , with that deadpan of yours , I can see why CaitIin thinks you 're a little odd , bro . MAN ON P.A. SYSTEM : Lorentec . We see the future and make it happen today . Lorentec is the leading scientific discovery corporation in the world ... Hi . Annie Boertz . Media relations . RICH : Hey . Hey , Annie . Dick Yarborough , a pleasure to meet you . This is Sue Truftin . Hi . Now , Sue is my fact-checker , so if I get anything wrong , you blame her , okay ? Don 't worry , we will . So ? So , we really appreciate you taking the time . We 're really interested in finding out a little bit more history about one of your products , Nortide . The anti-depressant . That 's right . One of our biggest sellers . Oh , we know it . And Nortide 's just meant so much to so many people Yeah . that we were really curious to find out a little bit more about the man who was responsible ... Or woman . That 's right , Sue , thanks . She keeps me honest , doesn 't she ? Or the person who is responsible for developing the drug , initially . You know , who led the design team ? You know ... I don 't know . That is a very good question . Do you mind waiting here for a sec ? See if I can dig something up ? Okay . ( MAN CHATTERING OVER P.A. SYSTEM ) Why did you do that ? What ? You 're killing me with the lines here . I mean , I was trying to stick to my lines . No , no . I know . I was trying to , Iike add in that woman thing , because ... Don 't improvise . It 's killing me . But then she 's gonna think ... You know , she thinks that ... should we get out of here ? should we get out of here ? No , we should stay . I think it 's ... ANNIE : Hi . This is bill WoIff , one of our in-house counsels . Hey , bill , how are you ? Mr. Yarborough . Miss Truftin . Yes . You know we called Scientific Explorer and they said you didn 't actually work there . No . That 's ... Not technically . But that 's just because we ... Because we 're freelance . And actually , Scientific Explorer is really interested in the piece , and it wouldn 't take us very long to go through the archives . We just have a couple of questions ... I 'm sorry , but our archives are private . Do you need validation ? That is what I call getting stonewalled . Yeah , well , we ain 't giving up that easy . What , you 're gonna , Iike , hack into their archives ? No , it 's only one clue . That 's our only clue . You know , you would 've made a lousy insurance investigator . I 'II take that as a compliment . Hey , wait a minute . What ? Look at all these small biotech firms Lorentec acquired . So ? So , you don 't get to be the world 's biggest pharmaceutical company by making everything in-house . You get big by acquisitions . So any one of these firms could have been the one that made Nortide initially . This is a domesticated specimen . There 's absolutely no guarantee he 'II survive in the wild . So what if he doesn 't ? It 's still the most likely way to get a handle on the problem . You saw how many eggs were out there . So you want to risk losing the one specimen we have that we can actually study to understand the species . This is a domestic safety issue . I got three deaths in under a week ( DOOR OPENING ) and no sense of what we 're dealing with . MILES : What 's going on ? They want to tag Nim . If we tag and release it here , he 'II lead us back to the school . And what are you gonna do if you find them ? We 're gonna protect this community , son . What else ? ( TAG GUN CLICKING ) will you help us ? ( NIM WHINING ) ( WATER SPLASHING ) Nim ? Nim ? ( GROWLING ) ( FIRING GUN ) ( NIM WHINING ) RICH : So Lorentec bought this place to get Nortide ? LAURA : You saw the plaque at Lorentec . They bought everyone that had a good idea . Yeah , well , knowledge is power . hello ? hello ? Hey , Rich , what 're you doing ? I told you I ain 't quitting . Hey , hey , whoa ! It might be electrified . Hey . This is weird . There is nobody here . It 's like a ghost town . I think we should split up . No , that 's a terrible idea . Yeah , but look how big this place is . I think we should split up , then we can cover it faster . AII right , here . Take this then , all right ? That 's a hair trigger . Be careful . What are you gonna use ? I 'II use my mind . That 's my best weapon . Here . Like I said , what are you gonna use ? Funny . Die then . No , Rich , stop . I was kidding . Come on . I 'II do it . I 'II do it . Just how do you cock it ? It 's ready to go . You just take the safety off , all right ? Okay . You got it . SHERIFF : Where 's he going ? Back to the intracoastal , again . He seems lost . Is that possible ? He 'II find them . ( DOOR OPENING ) caitlin . I just came in for work and guess what I found out you did ? There 's a reason . I know . I know there 's something strange going on with you , that you don 't even want to understand . I do understand . I 'm changing . You want to be normal ? Is that so weird ? Besides , caitlin , these things are killing people . Nim isn 't . Everyone I know is worried that there 's nothing special about them , that they 'II never find what their life is about . But you ... You find something that no one on this planet has ever seen before , ever , something you claimed you loved , and you 're destroying it . SHERIFF : That 's it . Let 's go . AII right . Let 's do it , boys . Where 's everyone going ? Compton Marsh . Nim is settled in the Waterway there . It 's begun . ( WALKIE-TALKIE BEEPS ) Yeah , there 's no one over here . It 's like it 's abandoned . Yeah , this place is definitely cleared out . Pretty recently , too . ( WALKIE-TALKIE BEEPS ) RICH : I got nothing down here . I 'm in a room with a bunch of big machines and , I don 't know ... I found a computer here . AII right , well , get on it . See if you can find something . Hey , you got anything ? Yeah , it 's locked with a password , so , I just need a name , anything , just ... Who 's buying Nortide ? Yeah , there 's just some envelopes , some old invoices , not a whole helluva lot . LAURA : Rich ? Rich ? Rich ? I 'm all right . I 'm all right . Sorry . Don 't go silent like that . It 's really freaking me out . Don 't you wish you had that gun now ? ( OBJECTS CLATTERING ) ( CHILD CRYING ) Who 's over there ? Somebody in here ? Huh ? LAURA : I think I got something here . ( CHILD CRYING ) CHILD : Have you seen my mother ? Hey . What you doing back here , huh ? Somebody leave you here , huh ? Why don 't you come out from back there ? Come on . Come on , give me your hand . It 's all right , I won 't hurt you . Give me your hand . CHILD : ( IN DEEP VOICE ) You 're not my mother ! ( SCREECHING ) ( SCREECHING ) ( GROANING ) ( RICH GRO ANING ) Rich ? ( RICH GRO ANING ) Rich , I 'm coming ! ( CREATURE SCREECHING ) I 'm coming ! ( CREATURE SCREECHING ) RICH : help me ! help me ! Shoot her ! Shoot her ! TRAWLER CAPTAIN : ( OVER RADIO ) Well , we got them on the move here . We 're driving them into the marsh . Just keep driving them this way . We got a little something for them . ( MEN SHOUTING ) OFFICER 1 : Come on , boys . help us out . OFFICER 2 : Okay , now , listen up . Everybody , form a line ! SHERIFF : AII right , everybody spread out ! OFFICER 2 : Try not to shoot each other , all right ? Keep spreading down on the right . OFFICER : We 're ready . ( CRACKLING ) Everybody get ready ! Here they come . Take aim ! Fire ! miles ? I just ... I want ... caitlin , something terrible 's gonna happen . ( CREATURES WHINING ) Hey , Joe ! JOE : Yeah ? Like fish in a barrel , man ! That 's a keeper , huh ? ( GROANING ) Oh , God . Sorry . ( GROANING ) Sorry . I tell you what , you go to the bottom of the ocean and you see that thing and you think you seen it all . ( SIGHING ) hold still . Sorry , Rich . ( GROANING ) I thought it was gonna kill me . I really did . It spoke . It sounded like a little girl . I know . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) ELECTRONIC VOICE : That was a mistake . well , it probably was . But we had an encounter . It 's not just LiopIeuridon DNA that they 're manipulating . Listen , I have a list of the board of directors of Iderdex , okay ? I 'm sorry , I can 't . Okay , all you have to do is say yes or no . daniel Beecher . No . WHISPERING : Okay . Harvey Pierce . No . AIger KoestIer . ( GASPING ) AIger KoestIer . Did you hear what I said ? You are opening a door that cannot be closed . AIger KoestIer , yes or no ? Special collections library , Berkeley . Goodbye , Doctor . MAN : Hang in there , buddy . ( MAN CHATTERING ) ( MEN SHOUTING ) ( CREATURES WHINING ) Get back . Get back ! ( CREATURES WHINING ) ( MEN SHOUTING ) ( GUNS FIRING ) ( CREATURES GROWLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) ( GROWLING ) MILES : Nim , stop ! ( WHINING ) ( MEN SHOUTING ) ( NIM SNORTING ) I 'm sorry . ( WHINING ) I 'm so sorry . Dr. Morris . hello . Do you know who I am ? I can guess . I believe you 've violated company policy . Yes , I did . I 'd Iike to e-maiI my family to say goodbye . Of course . CAITLIN : miles ? ( CREATURES SNORTING ) caitlin , take my hand . I can 't . Hey , look at me . Take my hand . They won 't hurt us . It 's okay . Take my hand . I 've gotta go . You 're so beautiful right now . ( CREATURES WHINING ) MAN : What kind of freak is this kid ? The KoestIer Archive . Yeah . AIger KoestIer . Yes . I heard that he was actually a professor here at one point in his life . For almost 30 years , up until the early ' 50s . Okay . We don 't get a Iot of requests for this collection . No , well , thank you very much . Happy hunting . I believe this is what you 're looking for . Yes , thank you . Okay . Rich . It 's labeled , " The Discovery , 1957 . " obviously , they found something . What in the world do you think they 're looking for ? I don 't know , but whatever it is , I hope they got it on film . You think that 's KoestIer ? RICH : Maybe . It 's a good-sized expedition party . Hey , look . Look at this . There you go . Looks like they found something . Yeah . It looks like a crater or something or ... Hey ! Is that Cirko 's flower ? I don 't understand . What does that have to do with ... I know him . I know that guy . He was there . He was there when the creatures breached at BoIinas Bay with Cirko . ( STUTTERING ) That guy was there . That 's the same guy that got my blood taken at SuIIivan 's island . That 's impossible . Yes , he 's gotta be 50 years old . I mean , that guy would have to be 80 .

You are losing the suspect Loki Yes , thanks for the info ! The suspect went into the tunnel We can not move forward . We ' re losing . Do not let the suspect get into tunnel system , Loki . Again , the suspect should not escape the A14 sector . Where did she go ? Ah here it is ! Hey ! Remember me ? That way you pay for the coffee . and a biscuit ! Loki what are you doing there ? Having a bad day ! I have a big headache , I lost my coffee and what is worse all , been to a big party . Was ready for sex the daughter of the commander . Say that again Loki , say it again . I was wondering what comes next . What are the orders of the commander . That 's enough , send him to shoot . - Lord ? - Do it ! Knock down the suspect Loki . Are you sane ? This is an order of command . At what cost ? This means that Freeman gave you a direct order , pilot . Let I can get it in service tunnels Shit . Shoot the suspect This is a bad order , control . Walk ! Drop it . Not ! shit Sir , we 're receiving report an explosion . Some civilian ships involved . told Thirty bodies and is increasing . A call is coming commander T.K. Freeman . Major Sash ? Rebecca , are you awake ? It was you who called earlier when I was not ? probably not . So what 's the mission ? What ? No useless conversations , not , how have you been ? You already said that this is not social , We leave aside the mockery . I 'm glad to see that you do not lost its charm , and humor . How are you so prepared I 'll cut to the chase . We recently lost a team recognition That was developing a very important work . Search and recovery ? This work is for my station ? What is this , a situation of kidnapping ? Unfortunately , I do not think Sash , they were not lost in the tunnels . I wanted them to be . They disappeared at the surface . On the surface ? I know this may be difficult to understand , Sash . But , we are searching the surface at the moment ... It was not for me to be talking about this but you need to know ... We were Collecting samples , looking for clues ; trying to see if we could find something wrong . Maybe make our world habitable again . However , the nature of the environment indicated that these visits were dangerous . Our scientists have developed a serum which may contain viruses an area , but no cure . It allows the human body is exposed under current conditions , not more than 48 hours . and spent more than 48 hours and the team has not returned ! Bingo . Moreover , their equipment life support are exhausted . So you want to send me on a crazy mission to the surface to the infected find some people killed , for what ? Because there reading log their personal locators . Sash , they keep moving ! They are moving ! You are saying they are still alive ! That 's why we NEED to find them . Let me better understand all this - This team can be adapted the local atmosphere ? Not a chance . It is very critical without serum air can kill them in seconds . We are not expecting any good result of that . It is a comforting thought . I have a choice ? Have you asked . Honestly no . But I hope you want take this job . I and everyone we know how much you want to see the surface of the earth again - and by his gaze , you want to start soon . What is the worst pick up this mission is a joke ! It is a great privilege . Sash , we do not have time for this . I know how hard it must be for you since Loki left , We also regret their loss . He was a great pilot - He still is . But life goes on Sash . Take this mission . At the risk of being friendly ; It will be good for you . You will have another partner when you get to climb chamber . Ok I 'm in , but on one condition . Workers sewer ! Huh ! Looks like I ' m in the presence of royalty here . This guy ? Looks more like a loser if you want my opinion . Oh yes , my fault . It 's like a kitten leaves terrorists kill innocent people . I am not sure , mate ? Bad company . You should be so depressed - As a kitten ! It 's easier if you ask me . Seems like yourself caught any form of work . This shit ! You do not want to buy me a drink ? What ? Você.não.quer.me.pagar.um.drinque ? No , I can not say yes , mate . then kindly ... leave ! We have something else in mind . We do not want to make him suffer ! and I believe this is a correct bar ! when suffering , be sure to let me know . Ok ? come on guys a little more effort at work . bastard Wait , wait , wait ... girls I 'll throw myself on the floor , you ... Hit me . I found this funny ! Yes , use the bench , you get the idea . He does not seem to be here . Teach him ! Teach him . Teach it with this stool . You are a philosopher , I can see this stool . Use the bench . You want to do this ? I 'm guessing if you have enough brain mass to make beautiful the face of his friends there - You want to find ? You guys need references , you will let me know . what the hell you think Loki doing that ? Just having a drink with friends - You are very lucky . Those idiots could have killed him . You want one ? Loki ' s just a hobby . I heard that now you are a real pilot . I heard you 're working sewerage sector ! Yes , they pay us with shit ... Are you sure ? I did not come here to drink . Well , just between us , I not recommend the food . This is not you , you ' re a pilot . Pilot , great driver . Loki - fly Air : Die ! What do you think ; is not a good slogan ! Now you 're being pathetic . A minor setback and you are intoxicated with alcohol . Is finished , work it ! Not here , not here . It was not your fault . Look , the reason I 'm here is because that Freeman gave me a new mission . and I need a pilot . Major Floor wrong . I pile shit , remember . I need someone I trust to be my partner in rear . But forget . I have a responsibility here . This is good because we are going to surface . - To the surface ! That 's what I ' m telling is . I also spoke to the Freeman could not take this quest unless we have you on board part of this mission . I can not do that Sash . My pilot just days . Well , there is a chance that we can not survive anyway ! What ? Can be dangerous nobody really knows what will happening out there . But it seterminarmoscom do something to help the colony , Maybe reclaim the planet - Just speculation ? Can it be ? But I will not do this without you . and on the orders of Freeman ? Forget . Me too ! Let 's go up ? We can not go back ? Sounds like a suicide mission ! You have something in mind ? The transport that will take them to surface will go through the roof controlled using pulse . It is perfectly safe . We have not lost anyone so far . How will he get back ? He will not . It 's just a journey . The return is only possible through the tubes of pressurized air . They can only be opened inside ! So we will have to fly back ! Is this why you came my boy ! The air ducts open automatically at intervals of time . We have no control over them So it has to go now . How do we find the ship ? There is a C7Z in hangar near the site we lost the first team . It was for them to return , Now is yours . We have no idea as opening occurs have to find a light guide . You do not have to find it , leave with one of the team members . Team ? What team ? We think you need some help here these guys are equipped in all the areas you need . Commander , I never asked him . Some of them went to the surface before ? This group does . They are the best do not worry . They may not be the best , The boys have the prerequisites for this job . leave . I 'll let you familiarize yourself . Oh , Loki ? Stay away from my daughter . Appreciate it if you did that . It may be a good ride ! Check the status of the launch , please . Minute , sir foul . Report the status of captain system . Control drive online and functioning . Okay , listen up everybody , let 's do it quickly . This is Major Sash it will Analyze your reports . Hey , it will mark you Sergeant ! This is private , but for purposes of this expedition ... We suggest leaving Svelder as the Sergeant sniper , due to the fact that he is this team and he has more knowledge than I on our needs at the surface . Major Sash already know that this little expedition will be monitored . Correct ? Correct . And your pilot will Loki - you will like it . It is our Airman . Lord we have a strange reading the propellant four What diagnosis is showing ? Diagnosis was inconclusive , sir . It may just be the heat of the cells increasing fuel , then it will be better now abortarmos and do a full scan . Keep up the count . Ok , join the staff - this will not be comfortable . Are we really to the surface ? I was born there . Yes ? Yes , you had this sort , exposed to air ! Careful or you may have a new look : exposed to air . Ha ha ! That was good . She needs you here Gibson ! Close this Cole . continue using their equipment . Because you do not use my equipment , any day ? Hey pilot , what you drive ? anything lately . Are you kidding me ? No , to be honest I lost like about everything related to fly ! You better find the taste again . What 's that on your helmet ? Heh means my noble nature ! Do not worry about it , It is actually a cat . Plot ! Full Scan . We are ready Ok everyone save your breath . We will need the surface . And remember during ascent maintain his lips tightly closed or be responsible for losing their languages ? . You think you can keep your mouth Gibson closed for three minutes ? Cole ! Are you online ? Sergeant Navimap online . Begin at my command Good luck guys . Begin ! Turn on all thrusters Hawk 2 is ok . Approaching the exit 1 . The time is correct . Output one is open . 3 ... 2 ... 1 Output one is released Sir , we have a warning light four engine ! What is the problem ? Complete failure . What is the situation with the two output ? It 's getting very slow sir . Lord , I abort ? No . Stay the course . But sir , if it is too slow . I am fully aware of the problem , thank you very much . Two output opening now . How long have they ? 15 seconds . Four engine not responding . Come on . Four motor is out of operation . We have passed the point of no return now . Two output closing . Engine number four resumed operation . What the hell was that ? Two Falcon reached our target . We did everything we could . Now they are on their own . Wow . Yeah Wow . I 've never been on the surface before ... I remember some things but it was not like this ... Nobody ever told you that is ugly whisper ? Ah , that exciting touch makes you want to vomit ! Alright team , it 's time let 's get going . Okay Cole , Keep your eyes on the target . I will not be surprised by tempestado acid rain again . Not so fast . Cole let the serum ready . Ok Sgt . Do you really think these things are running ? Hem ? Between us I have no clue . But sometimes you want to escape these things . Jesus ! Are you okay ? Yeah Wow ! This is a good thing . Want to go next ? Yeah , sure , why not ? Never let it speak I have not tried these things . Good man . This really hurts . I know . I 'm going caring for others . If you want another dose Give a shout . I ' m fine , thanks . Okay who wants another round of doses ? Come Gibson , do it like a man . Let me , you pervert ! Cole not there , arm . Hey Loki , you saw Maddox somewhere . Hey , Maddox ! when you finish here I have something else for you . Buster . He ' s coming . Hey this is clear mellhor needle before use me Cole I do not want to catch something Gibson ' s . God ! What is this ? Cole ! You bastard . Come here ! Do not run away ! My scratching continues . Was to scratch ? Maybe Cole has not given you in a large enough dose ! How can he sleep ? This is called morphine . What was this ? Probably just the wind ! You can verify this , sergeant ? Yes , we do not want our pilot has bad dreams , do we ? No , forget it , probably some animal . Wait a minute , I 'm missing something here , an animal ? It was not to be all dead here ? This is what you should believe ! What do you mean " had to believe " ? Come on , you 've heard of the " Project " ? Of course , the attempt to return people to the surface cleaning the air and making the planet habitable ! Um , Um , wrong answer ! And you 're a major ! This is history government cover-up . History of cover-up for what ? Yes Sergeant , tell him what you know . Actually only part . Come on , tell him . I heard this many times . I 'll get more wood for the fire . The project is an attempt to return surface . Not clearing the air or eradicating the virus , ms for the creation of a vaccine . A vaccine that protects completely the body against viruses . Yes , nothing serum protection 48 hours ! But surely , this would not be a theory ? Sash not , they did it . The government created this vaccine . First they tested the animals . and it worked . Very little . What do you mean ? The vaccine met its objective . The central nervous system survived to virus attacks . The animals did not die . No side effects as well , this early . So the government discovered a problem ? Only when they started injecting in some humans . Human ? Almost human , prisoners , terrorists . And what happened to the animals ? They lived out their natural lives . The virus could not kill them , age could not kill them . Hunger could not kill them . Eternal youth ? Not completely . I love this part . They continued living but were in constant turmoil , The body cells not replicate naturally they were tired , decaying - rotting inside . Even in death , they did not die . And they have this thing for humans ? Bullshit ! The government may be crap but they did not go down to this level . This opens breach human rights . Terrorists also have rights . So come on , next page , what happened to the people ? I know that the government let them live a life of extreme suffering , no food , no water , only suffering . Eternal suffering . They are out there , rotting ! This story will get worse . Cole said it 's better to forget . Okay , everybody , let 's rest . Tomorrow we will find our team . What the hell is this place ? Any living room . Yes , the last living room . Everyone stay alert . This is the last known position the team missing , Keep your eyes open . Take care of security , Maddox , These are our own people that 're looking at . Come on . Still nothing ? Clear target . Well those signs came from somewhere then locate them , genius . You want to try ? Let there guys . Wait , stop ! I picked up a signal . Let 's take a look Is weak , I can not improve it . Increase this ! Thanks Marconi is on this side . What do you think ? These monkeys do not think lit butts in the dark with both hands and a torch . This is one of those teams , Chargers weapons . Cole , I have to get a return video now ! A platoon is getting a record visual mission . Whatever has happened with them can be on this tape . Something in the Cole video ? Man , what is wrong with this guy ? you want it in stereo ? Tap the damn tape . Okay , I got it , . Shit ! Look at them ! A squadron , bunch of cats . Get that out of my front you idiot . This is not a walk by the sea . He never changes , does it ? Focus on work I knew I could not be any living thing around here ! What are you ... You are seeing wrong , what is this ? Place this in a clear , he does not know how to use it ... You can not improve it ? What is this ? Rather , what does it do ? Jesus . This is .. this is insolence . What ' s in the box , man ? Something shone here ! Ok , guys , I ' m going to check . Cover me ! Come on ! Oh , this is not my lucky day . What is this man , what was it ? Nobody wants to be here to find it ? The other team was eliminated . Mission aborted . We do not know if they are dead not find any body . You were not looking for exactly ? What are we waiting for ? Pack it . The signal they received was in motion . How could they died ? Instrument set on me not care , I will never put my team in danger , we now move it . We are in danger , this is a rescue mission . We have another 24 hours before the serum to stop functioning . We make one last attempt ? Are you blind ? The other team is dead . Yes , but what no one asked died as they were . Who cares ? Come on . Shut up ! This is a storm of acid rain ... I do not like this sound . Now , let 's go ! Find me a quick shelter , has been an acid rain . Get them , get them ! Move it , move it , move it . Come over here , move it , come here , let 's ... OK , we 'll wait here all night . Get some sleep . Loki you take the first turn . I come to you to replace the second . This gorgeous , no ? In a funny , yes way . Ok Pilot , get some sleep , tomorrow will be your big day . I do not know that . Hey you 'll be fine . They are not pretty ? Never thought of it before . Yes , they are cute but at this point it means nothing . What are you thinking about Loki ? What goes on in your head ? Now , right now I 'm thinking ... I 'm thinking that there is something this mission that stinks more my work in the sewers . This is not right Maddox . Svelder gone ! Here ! So where is he ? Well anything that caught others took the Svelder . You mean he ' s dead ! He 's not dead ! Maybe others have found . Well , yes , that makes sense but where they take him ? We 'll find Svelder , We found the down tube for C7z and let 's get out of here . Hey honey I 'm in the race when Svelders if . Keep the orders , right ? Oh , and things are going well . You got a problem with me pilot ? A problem with you , as I might have a problem with you ? One more step and you will be in a world of suffering , shithead ! A step ! Come on then . This is not helping . Listen bitch , if not for you 'd be gone by now . Wait I got a reading the locator , moving west . Svelder . Show me ! Right . Grab your kit , 're going after him . Are four , not five signs . Orientation ? Straight ahead , some type of circular formation . Sash take the signal . I ' m not getting . Yes , you are . There is more than one signal , this is not right . He probably found the other , is the only reason to have left us . Sash is right . Not go ahead . I 'm going ahead and you also . Why have to go on ? To protect me . We can not protect you there . Cole Gibson you are with me , yes ? Let this " kitten " there . Come on . And if not the team ? We give coverage to one another be ready for anything . There are six signals , Svelder must have found the entire staff . Come on . I can not see anyone . Are you sure you ' re reading this thing right ? They must be right . I think you need some help . You crazy , come on . Svelder , you bastard I thought you had gone ! Do not try to talk , mate , we 'll take it from here . His eyes , I saw his eyes they are human ... Who , who are they ? Let him come mate , Let me get you out , come on . We need to find out what happened to him . No we do not need . We need to get out of here . Cole you got , Sash and Loki will flank , Gibson bring them in the back . I 'm reading the target again . Where ? - I can not find . The signal is too weak . Increase the signal . 'm Raising . ' m Raising . come on , grow it fast . Six signs , I ' m not sure . Sure . Where ? They are right behind you ! Paste which is reading . 5 yards and closing . We could not even eye contact . Come on you bastards ! Stay in the center . I do not like it , let 's get out of here ! Come on . Come on . Come and grab a piece of me ! Come on , you sons of bitches ! Who she is shooting ? Gibson . Gibson ! Come and get me you bastards ! Keep walking . I 'm going back to get it . Come on . Gibson ? Where is Gibson ? What happened ? She 's dead , she 's gone . Come the left , let 's get out of here ! Come on , move it ! Should be here . What the hell happened back there ? I do not know . I do not need to know . Everything you need to know and if you can fly that ship . Do not tell me you 're filling bottles with this ? Do not touch me . Shit ! What now ? What are you talking about ? The trapdoor is not here , antennas broke ! We 're in trouble , we 're dead ! No . Mate . It 's ok , not ... Sash ! Cole ! Come here ! Overthrew his soldier , fallen man . Grab your stuff ! Come on ! Wait ... yeah ... Maddox , he 's dead . He 's dead , Maddox . We are going to find this trapdoor . We 're out of here . We 'll split up and locate this trapdoor . No way . You are crazy . Not with these things circling around . Hear me , Maddox . Listen ! If not we do not get moving , I do not think we 'll see tomorrow . Yes , you are right , but someone should stay with the body of Svelder . I do not want to see these things coming catch it . We 'll find some shelter . I 'm staying . I can not see you guys using NaviMap , they sure do not come back the same areas . Okay Put your body there . if we do not locate this trapdoor within four hours Be killed by the virus anyway . I 'm worried about the other two . They are terrified . They are terrified . Just do not know who we 're fighting . Do you have any idea ? Sobriety is a bitch ? Look , this thing out there , Sash is the last of our problems If we 're not back soon , we will die anyway Yeah , right . If you see something moving you shoot , right ? Except Maddox . Hi Cole . Its area remains clean , Loki . Not yet found anything ? Nothing to do here mate , as are the others ? All quiet . Out . Sash , how are things ? Alright . Out . Cole , how this thing should look like ? Two large silver doors , oh , and your antenna lost . very funny , Cole . Yes , yes ! Cole ! I located the trapdoor . I found Cole respond . What is happening there ? Cole ! Shit ! You ' re making a big mate error . I do not know . I think we hit a shot one of the boys who came to rescue , was a big mistake , Mate ? I never thought I would be able to say it is good to see you mate . Well Travis I also never expected say this in response . I 'm fine , do not really need their care at this point . Yeah , right ! this thing should not be here , man . This also occurred to me . How many are there in your team ? There were six , now I 'm not sure . Someone alpha team survive ? No , they 're all dead and we we also , if we do not take us out . What happened ? Come , let 's go now ! Travis has a question I have tried to answer every day . What is going on here ? It is a mission of the black book , a day lost , as they say . We went to the surface to collect samples while you were here . We thought of some blow buildings that did not need more ? So what is the problem ? Slater ! Always a nosy bastard . We keep very well explosives . They are disguised like rays of light . They can blow up everything in a radius of two hundred miles . So it 'll be a show for the crazies . We split , that is evil , There are hundreds of them ! We will have no chance . We must drive the RV point if something goes wrong . I 'll be here waiting . Near midnight the rest them will arrive . Unless they are not . What do you mean , " are not they ? I do not know , I can not explain it the best way . Her eyes are dead . I know I have to shoot in many companions tonight . Keep your head up . Cole ! Maddox ! For all we know we are dealing is what to do with this installation . The big problem is that I do not understand some things on this computer . really interesting stuff I do not understand . Access granted . How did you ... ? It 's a long story . We ' re here . Right in the center of this temporary laboratory . They should have developed various kinds of experiments Hi ! I am the antivirus Mr. An injection and be in their blood . I was raised as a cure for the virus but the doctors did not tell them is that I ' ll cook your blood and fry your brains . I can be transmitted from many different ways including castrations and itching . This is running ? This is the daily newspaper , Entry 243 , 48th day . Today we confirmed that finally got a shortcut for what we were waiting for so long . We have achieved success making the investment in the virus atmosphere without effect . In layman 's terms , how you can clearly see in this video Now air from the atmosphere is breathable . This trap is safe ? As you see the virus has mutated . But what is ironic to me . In the search for a cure , we create a much worse disease . Whatever it is needs to be eliminated quickly . It was for this that sent us . So why send a rescue team ? PR . They did not expect the our return . Look who they sent as a pilot . I 'm afraid to report that some thing escaped . We can not let this thing go underground . It would be an apocalypse . Someone wants this mission fail . Someone who sent him here . Do not make secret We Commander Freeman . Freeman . After the sixth level of access . Wait a second , where you withdrew this code ? You have not picked his daughter , did you ? You did it ! Did not you ? You did it ! I was drunk . I was late . I do not remember . Were you wanting to keep sex with a girl and can not remember it ? What did you get her ? This is not important . This detail can put Freeman away for a long time . You have a problem with that ? No problem . The bastard sent me here to die . So let 's drop it . This here looks like a school . I have to get some things . Be quick . You stupid bitch ! You killed Svelder ! Maddox think ! There was Svelder , this was not the Svelder ! To me it seemed to be the Svelder ! Listen , something is keeping these living things . Nothing can stay alive here , right ? Right . This may sound crazy but if the same thing the infected Svelder You 're right ... this sounds crazy ! Sorry guys . Travis , what are you doing ? Whatever that is . Do not make noise . Go , go . Move on . Move Loki . Go ... come here . Loki ! There is only one way out now . Come on . Here ! They are many , we can not stay here ! This is not my lucky day . Clean ! Looks like you 're going home alone . The door can not be closed this way . Go . Save yourself , save others and ensure that Freeman will pay for it . See you later , mate . Travis ! Right . What the idiots want to be the first ? Hey , I think you ' re safe now . Nice story . What happens next ? Cole back to life and let 's have a beer . Maybe ... Now do you believe me ? Yes .. I found the trapdoor . Let 's go home . What we do now , what do we do ? We go to the trapdoor that will allow back home ... Sash ? Sash ! We can not do this . What ? If these things the way they think for underground , can spread the virus and kill everybody . No way ! I say we - They are here , what can we do ? Fight ! Let 's blow this place . and this epidemic and let 's clean it up . With what ? have no explosive . We have boots pumps . If we put a burden on them can cause a large explosion . But we use them all one may not be enough . Maddox right , let 's all join pumps , carry guns to maximum and put to explode . One at each corner and one fifth under the tower in the center , right ? What the hell . Good ! Charge in one position and ready to fire . Ok boot four five ready for the party . Ok everyone , let 's go to the tower . It 's time . After the first load blow the tower we will have 10 seconds . It is a very short time . Before the rest explode destroying all these bastards . We also , if you do not locate the ship . Yes , yes . Got it . you press the button and BOOM ! When you find the call in nature and we will find it . Let 's do this . Good luck Loki . Luck is not the main . All clear . Go ! And if he can not do it ? He ' ll get . He has to get . Do you trust this guy too . It 's more than confidence . I have a little problem here ! What is happening Loki ? I 'm seeing our friends . They are between me and the trapdoor . You can get close ? Negative . Loki ? Loki ! If he is gone . We 're in trouble , There is nothing we can do . We have to abort . We ' ll cross that , Maddox ! Do you understand me ? Anyway ! Now let 's put some loads . We have company . Guess who came to dinner ! Shit , we 're surrounded . So what 's the plan ? try not to die . Beautiful plan . What are they waiting for ? Maybe they 're making jokes . You want something ? Ok ! Who wants to do this ? We will return . Let 's go back to the tower ! Take this ! It was good , was good . I liked . Loads ready . You go ahead . Go to the tower ! Maddox ! - Come on , boy . - You will . I 'll stop them . Stand up ! Now ! Are you okay ? Will do well if I say no ? No . Give me your flag We will take a leap . Wait guys . Wait . Jesus Christ ! Wait ! I knew that . I knew you could do it ! Let 's get out of here ! Mooring up . Call the coming Commander TJ Freeman . Sash , Loki are you there ? We are observing their signals . Increase the signal . We lost two teams and everything was destroyed . So the mission failed . Do you think this was a success ? So , everything was destroyed ? Yes , everything was destroyed . Well , almost everything . Good God !

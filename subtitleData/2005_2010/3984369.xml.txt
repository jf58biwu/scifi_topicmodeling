" I left all the Crap behind . Now I live off of sports betting . There 's a fortune in it when you know the results . And the other you ? - You know how it works . I didn 't want to kill him . Your buddy was absolutely right about one thing : We are murderers . It 's the price we pay for our happiness . The fucking admission fee , so to speak . We have all paid this price . " We " ? - We . How many are we ? We are plenty . Do you think you 're the first one who Can 't handle the stress ? Who 's got trouble adjusting ? HomesiCkness , guilty conscience ... I 've seen it all .

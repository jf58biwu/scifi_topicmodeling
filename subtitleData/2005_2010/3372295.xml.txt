 A child is born to innocence . A child is drawn towards good . Why then do so many among us , go so horribly wrong . Everyone on the ground , now . My name is Chandra Suresh . I 'm a geneticist . I have a theory about human evolution , and I believe you are a part of it . ( Mohinder ) What makes some walk a path of darkness , while others choose the light ? Oh . Is it will ? Is it destiny ? Can we ever hope to understand the force that shapes the soul ? For thousands of years , my people have taken spirit walks , following destiny 's path into the realms of the unconsciousness . ( Hiro ) Okay . I 'm ready to begin my journey . Hiro ? Hiro ? ( Mohinder ) To fight evil , one must know evil . One must journey back through time and find that fork in the road - Hiro ? ! Where heroes turn one way - Hiro ? ! and villains turn another . ( Arthur ) I 'd like to thank all our dear friends for coming tonight and for helping us to celebrate . Nathan- - the finest Assistant D.A. New York has ever known . Peter , whose compassionate heart is a gift to us all . Told you he couldn 't say " nurse " out loud . - All right . But most of all to Angela ... the love of my life . Happy anniversary . ( all ) Cheers . ( Angela ) That was lovely . Let me have a- - [ both groaning ] All right , get a room . - After 41 years of marriage , you take it where you can get it . Congratulations , Mom . Congratulations , Dad . ( Daniel ) My king . My queen . Congratulations . Thank you , Daniel . Thank you . - Congratulations . [ clears throat ] Hmm . So , Nathan , are the rumors true ? Excuse me ? I heard your office is about to launch a full-scale investigation into all things Linderman . Care to comment ? I 'd shave my wrists . Handcuffs chafe . Come on . Let 's get a drink . - Oh . [ laughing ] Good one . [ sighs ] What do see there , Arthur ? [ feedback , distorted tone ] Trouble . Well , I 'm sure I can handle the heat . It 's not you I 'm worried about . If he starts investigating , he 's gonna see your hand behind every enterprise I 've been working on for the past 25 years . We can 't have the D.A. digging up skeletons . If you fall , I fall . Maybe you could talk to him one last time . Convince him to back off . When Nathan digs his teeth in , he doesn 't let go . So what do we do ? Read your Shakespeare . When the son challenges the father , only one is left standing . I should have one last talk with him . I owe him that . What happens if that doesn 't take ? Well , then I 'll ... kill him . ( Flint ) And now , who 's the man , yo ? - I 'm the man . I 'm sorry , who 'd you say ? Who 's the man ? I 'm the man ! [ laughing ] Look at this here . Back door- - book it ! Yeah , you got it . - You- - Flint . Hey ! Hey , buddy ! Hey , kiss the floor ! ( Meredith ) Flint , let it go ! Hey , buddy ! I 'm talking to you . You should listen to your sister . Run ! Flint , let 's go ! Run ! [ sighs ] [ chair squeaking ] My name is Brian Davis . ( Sylar ) Incredible . Can you make it go away ? Don 't worry , Brian . I can fix it . Don 't worry , Brian . I can fix it . Hello ? ( Brian ) Make it go away , make it go away . [ Sylar choking ] [ gasping , panting ] Are you all right ? Are you all right ? Say something . Forgive me . [ crying ] Everything is gonna be okay No , it isn 't . I 've done something unforgivable . Everybody does bad things . You think I haven 't felt exactly how you 're feeling right now ? Maybe if you talk about it . Sometimes when you talk about it- - I can 't . A man had something that I wanted , but i took it at a terrible price . I know it seems hard to imagine , but you 're gonna get through this , because you 're not a bad person . You don 't even know anything about me . I know what I see- - A man who deserves a second Chance . The rope broke . You can 't tell me that 's not a sign . [ scoffs ] [ chuckling ] I don 't even know your name . Elle . Elle . Well , look at you , Elle , just showing up out of nowhere , like an Angel . [ chuckles ] An Angel with a broken watch . [ sighs ] Cute meet . I still don 't understand why we don 't just bag and tag this guy like the rest of them . For years , scientists were stumped by the mystery of whale migration . Such a big ocean- - How do they find each other ? Then one night in the frozen pacific , some enterprising biologist recorded their song in the wild . They don 't sing in captivity . So we 've got to get the whale to sing . What Mr. Gray can do is extraordinary . The ability to transfer Power from one vessel to another is extremely rare . Yeah , but how do I get him to do it ? Pie . ( Thompson ) Nine group homes in seven years . Four of them burned to the ground . There 's a shocker . What 's the deal ? I mean , isn 't that why we 're here , so you can offer me a deal ? You have a gift , Meredith , And with gift comes opportunity . The company would like to train you to become an agent . It won 't be easy . It 'll demand a lot of hard work . Me , an agent ? I don 't think so . Why do you hate the company so much ? I have my reasons . And I would ask you ... to put those reasons aside and make the sensible decision . That ... or spend the rest of your life in an asbestos-lined cell . One condition ... promise me the company won 't go after my brother . You 're not in a strong negotiating position here , so what will it be- - agent or prisoner ? When do I start ? ( Angela ) Arthur ? You look spectacular . I wish you would reconsider . He can barely fit a dozen people in that shoe box anyway . Arthur , it 's his graduation party . Yeah , from nursing school . Be patient with him . When his powers manifest , Peter will become a great man . [ door closes ] Tell him I 'm sorry I couldn 't get there . Hey , there . Just thought I 'd stop by to see if- - - I tried . He won 't . Nathan , while you 're here ... I really wish you 'd reconsider handing off The Linderman case to another A.D.A. Come on , Dad , we 've talked about this . I 'm not asking as a lawyer . I 'm asking as a father . I 'm concerned about the pressure that your prosecuting my client will put on this family . Don 't be . Linderman 's toxic to this family , Dad . Nothing would make me happier than to bury him in a very deep hole for a very long time . What ? You look good in a suit , Nathan . What does this guy want ? [ gasping ] Nathan ! Heidi ! ( Heidi ) Aah ! Heidi ! Nathan ! Thank god ! Is she all right ? Don 't even talk to me , Dad . Nathan . You think I don 't know who did this ? It was Linderman 's guys that ran me off the road . Are you sure ? - That 's it , Dad ? That 's the best you got- - am I sure ? You invite that man into our home . He tried to kill me , Dad ! Come on , stop . - Heidi will never walk again ! ( Peter ) Stop ! Stop ! Just stop . - Okay . [ sighs ] Heidi ... It 's her spine . She broke her back . Oh , god ! Oh , no ! ( Peter ) I know . Mom . She just woke up , and she 's asking for you . Come on . Hey , wait . I 'm gonna hurt that man . And when I do , if you 're standing next to him , you 're gonna get hurt too . You might want to choose a side , Dad- - your client or your family . Nathan . [ keys clacking ] Any word ? I spoke with the neurologist . Her spine is broken in three places . It doesn 't look good . Arthur ... What Nathan said about Linderman ... You can 't be serious . Come on , Angela . Linderman wouldn 't dare go after Nathan on his own . No , he wouldn 't . What are you asking ? Am I trying to kill my son ? Nathan 's an Assistant D.A. It could 've been any one of 100 indicted criminal driving that Van . I will not have this conversation . No , I know . You 're right . But I need to hear you say it , Arthur . Did you order Linderman to kill Nathan ? No . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I love you , Arthur . I love you too . There 's our man . You want me to light him up ? Negative . This is strictly a training mission . You 're gonna watch and learn . No powers , unless I give the order . [ clears throat ] Danny Pine ? Who wants to know ? Jim Farrell with the V.A. I just need a minute of your time , pal . My partner and I are trying to transition some of the homeless vets out here into affordable housing . We feel it 's a crime the way this country 's turned its back on you guys . Yeah , what happened to Scofield ? Scofield ? The V.A. rep that was out here last week . Right . Oh , yeah , he was reassigned to Dallas . Uh , Farrell and I- - we 're the new team now . ( Thompson ) That 's the story . Aah ! Aah ! [ taser clicking ] Oh . Oh . Welcome to the company . [ knock at door ] Hi . Do you like pie ? Oh , that rhymed , didn 't it ? [ chuckling ] Come on in . ( Sylar ) I 'm really--I 'm really glad you came , Elle . I-I wasn 't sure you would . I have been thinking about you and--and wondering how you 've been since- - Oh , better . Great , actually , um ... Thanks to you . I just decided to clean up this place , and all this clutter was filling my head with bad thoughts . Yeah . What 's this ? Oh , that 's just , um ... It 's just a list of people like me . Nice , single guys like you ? [ laughs ] [ chuckles ] Maybe I should take this list . Oh , no , no ... Um , I 'm sorry , Elle . There 's ... there 's something you should know about me . I have a kind of a power- - um , an ability that 's out of the ordinary . I don 't understand . [ gasps ] Oh , my god . You- - the other people on the list- - they can do things too . W- - Wait . There are others ? What kind of pie did you bring ? Peach . That 's my favorite kind . [ chuckles ] [ plates clanking ] Good work , Meredith . You were born for this . Yeah , so that 's it ? I 'm an agent now ? Not quite . Getting scum off the street , that 's the easy part . The real test is loyalty . You 're not gonna always agree with the decisions the company makes , but when you prove you can follow orders No questions asked , that 's when we 'll call you " Agent Gordon . " Put him in cell nine . Come on . [ door opens ] ( Flint ) Meredith ? ! Flint ? ! [ laughing ] [ sighs ] I thought you got away . Yeah , well , an invisible man tackled me in the alley . What , are they gonna make you an agent also ? What ? What do- - what do you mean " also " ? What did they tell you ? They 're gonna train me , Mer . I 'm gonna get to wear one of them , uh , suits and everything . Oh , Flint . This is gonna be great , Mer . It 's gonna be you and me , working together . [ door opens ] Is there a problem ? No , sir . - Good . No problem at all . This is bag and tag , baby , bag and tag ! [ laughing ] [ Elle sighs ] I can 't believe you can just lift your finger and move things . It must feel amazing . It does . But it can be overwhelming too ... like a drug that you can 't get enough of . How many others are there like you ? With abilities ? I don 't know . To be honest , I don 't want to know . I have a kind of problem . I guess you could say I 'm like an addict . I have this overwhelming hunger to ... Um , I covet the powers of others . But somehow since the other day , since ... since meeting you ... I feel like maybe I don 't have to be so special . Maybe I can just be Gabriel again . But you are special , Gabriel . You 're special just the way you are . " Special just the way you are . " I was afraid you were about to burst into song . I was just trying to win his trust . Yeah , well , we 're stalling out here . We need to kick it into high gear . I don 't think he 's gonna kill again . I rely think we should look Into someone else on this list . No , we 're sticking with the plan . Mr. Gray is a killer . We know that . The only question is , " will we witness the act , or will he do it in a dark alley somewhere ? " But what if you 're wrong ? What if his suicide attempt was a wake-up call ? You like this guy . Oh ... Isn 't that adorable ? You think he 's sweet , is that it ? What about this one- - Trevor Zeitlan ? I 'm not gonna do it . We need to see him kill . I am not going to do it . All right , if that 's how you feel . [ door opens ] [ sighs ] Here , go ahead . Go on . New York City- - you could , I don 't know , become a waitress ? [ scoffs ] We have orders , Elle . You don 't follow orders , you 're not an agent . You 're not an agent , you 're on your own . Your father has been training you for this since you were four years old . Come on . [ sighs ] Let 's introduce Mr. Zeitlan to Mr. Gray . I 'm sorry , Arthur . I don 't know how he survived that crash . You know how badly you screwed this up ? Now Nathan 's out for blood . Look , maybe we should rethink this . I mean , a second attempt is bound to look suspicious , and who knows how Angela 's gonna react ? What do you suggest- - we abort ? No , no . Not abort , no . Postpone . - You 're not thinking this through . The plan for New York has been years in the making . Do we postpone that , too ? No , no , not necessarily . I don 't know , Daniel . Sometimes I worry you 're outliving your usefulness . [ chuckles ] You 're--you 're right , Arthur . We should finish this . I know a guy in Montreal . He worked for me in Vegas . He 's good . Now , I can fly him down tonight . Angela . Angela ! Angela ! [ thinking ] It has to be done , Angela . Arthur , Don 't . You know I 'm right . It has to be done . He 's my baby . Say it , Angela . [ distorted tone ] My baby . Nathan has to die . It has to be done . Nathan has to die . [ distorted tone ] Nathan has to die . Hiro . Hiro ! Hiro , wake up . ( Usutu ) No , don 't wake him . Why ? What 's happening ? He 's trapped between this world and the next . If he wakes now , he could be stuck like this forever . Wha--we have to do something . Here ... Mix . [ mumbling quietly ] Something has disturbed his dream time . Part of him wants to wake , but his spirit walk is not complete . Careful not to inhale the fumes . [ mumbling stops ] It 's working . Yes . [ thud ] Put your shoes on ! What ? What 's going on ? There 's a train yard a half mile from here . We can catch a freight straight on into Houston . What are you talking about ? What about us being agents ? Now , these--these people been nice to me . They 're tricking you because you 're dumb . You remember what Daddy used to say- - " god gave you a big sister instead of a brain . " Put your shoes on . Now . [ train horn blows ] ( Meredith ) Once we reach Houston , we 'll head straight on into Mexico , Fly under the radar for a little while . Maybe we 'll work in a little cantina . Mexico sounds good . Flint . Flint , you got to understand something . You can 't ever trust the company . They will lie to you . They 'll lock you up or worse . You hear me , Flint ? You got to promise me that you 'll never , ever- - [ taser clicking ] You killed her ! That 's right , genius . I killed her . Now I 'm gonna kill you . ( Meredith ) Flint , look out ! Son of a bitch . Oh ! You were following me , huh ? Why do you have to screw this up ? Oh , come on , Flint , an agent ? We could 've given him a purpose ! Now--now he 's our sworn enemy . So am I ! [ water boiling ] [ knife tapping ] [ sniffs ] Mmm . That smells good . [ chuckles ] Almost as good as my pot pies . Daniel , I think Arthur 's downtown . Yes , he is . What 's on your mind ? The question is , Angela , what isn 't on yours . Look ... it wasn 't an easy decision to come , but believe it or not , I still have a shred of morality left in me somewhere . I can no longer stand by and watch him destroy you like this . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I know he 's working on a project . I don 't remember the , uh , details right now , but I 'm sure it has to be done . I can 't push a thought into your head , Angela , but i can heal the scars . What scars ? ! From all the times he 's forced his thoughts , erased your memories . Each time leaves its mark- - a trace of damaged tissue . I don 't believe you . Arthur would never do that to me . Arthur is betraying you in the most heinous way possible . How dare you ? He 's gonna kill your son . You 're a liar . I can heal the scars , Angela , but you have to decide . Do you want to live in blind obedience ? Or do you want to know the truth ? Nathan . [ sirens wailing in the distance ] So you never answered my question . Why do you hate the company so much ? 'Cause they killed my baby girl . It was 14 years ago . They caught up with me in this little village off the panhandle . They stormed in at night . There was a firefight . Place went up like kindling . And my little girl , Claire , she was killed in the fire . Claire . That 's what they told you- - she died in a fire . What is that supposed to mean ? Go . Go on before I change my mind . What ? Think of it as a get-out-of-jail-free card for your little girl . Go . [ sirens wailing , horns blaring ] [ coughing ] Help ! [ man coughing ] [ breathes deeply ] This ziti smells terrific . ( Sylar ) Can 't wait . Hey , have you ever been to that little theater down the street ? [ cork pops ] I saw that they had some sort of artsy spoken-word thing there tonight . Maybe we should stop by later . [ sniffing ] Oh . - Hmm , maybe we should . [ knock at door ] Oh , I invited someone to join us . I hope you don 't mind . It 's open ! Yeah , um , I 'm Trevor . We spoke on the phone . - I 'm Elle . And , um , this is Gabriel . I thought you two should meet . Trevor has an ability , too . An ability- - I don 't understand . Don 't be mad , but I got Trevor 's number off that list you had . I really think it 's important for you to get to know people like yourself . I mean ... Alcoholics can 't do it alone . Trevor , why don 't you show us what you can do ? Okay . [ gasps ] Wow . [ laughing ] That is so cool . Gabriel ? Isn 't that special ? Wait here . I have a great idea . Soup is delicious . Italian lentil- - your mother 's recipe . Something on your mind ? What 's the matter , Arthur ? You can 't see inside it ? [ inhales deeply ] You just seem ... far away . I just wonder sometimes if , without your Power , you 'd ... know me at all anymore . [ clears throat ] Indigestion ? So what do you think , Arthur ? Do you still know me ? Can you tell anything about me just by looking in my eyes ? You 're my wife , Angela . I know you like I know my own heart . Really ? So what am I gonna do now ? Am I gonna kiss you , or am I gonna kill you ? Oh ! I love that . Don 't you love that ? That 's great . It 's so special . Let 's see it again . You think he 's so special ? I bet He can 't do this . Gabriel . I think you need to leave , now . Gabriel , don 't ! [ breathing heavily ] Please ... how did you- - you don 't have to do this . Who are you ? Get out . [ door closes ] Aah ! We can 't do this . Bennet , we have to make him stop ! [ gasps ] This is incredible . ( Trevor ) Aaah ! [ crying softly ] He actually exposes the brain . Oh , my god . Our son , Arthur , our own son . There are larger issues at stake , Angela . You can 't let sentimentality derail everything that we 've worked so hard for . I 'm sentimental because I don 't want to murder our son ? We were gonna rebuild the world . You were a great man , Arthur . You were a visionary , but somewhere along the line , you lost your soul . And I make no apology- - I lied . It 's not your mother 's recipe . [ thud ] Use the incinerator on level three . Use my pass card to grant you Access . Should anyone ask , he 's a casualty of field op . ( Nathan ) Ma ? Nathan . Anybody home ? Ma ? ! Dad ! Oh , my god . I think he 's had a heart attack . Is he ... ? he 's still breathing . He 's still alive . [ cell phone beeping ] We 're wrapped here- - just one more loose end . No , no , not that thing- - the other thing . Okay , I 'll let you know . Don 't beat yourself up . We 've done invaluable work here . Those tapes will be studied and analyzed . We created a monster . We set him loose on the world . I wouldn 't worry too much about that . I get the feeling that we 'll be tracking down Mr. Gray again soon . That 's not the point ! He had a soul , Bennet . He could 've been saved . We 're not missionaries . If they had wanted us to bring him in , that would 've been the assignment . It wasn 't . We follow orders , Elle . We 're agents . That 's what we do . Now excuse me . My ride is here . Where to , my friend ? JFK , please . ( Nathan ) We should call Peter . Maybe we should wait . Until what ? Until we have something to tell him . I 'm sorry . He 's gone . He suffered a massive coronary , brought on by anterior myocardial infarction . There was- - there was nothing we could do . Heart attack ? I 'd like a cremation as soon as possible . Why don 't you go home and get some rest ? We can deal with the paperwork in the morning . I can 't believe it . He 's dead . [ door closes ] It 's done . Yes . I understand . She wants a cremation . I can procure another body , of course . I 'm afraid the poison caused irreversible damage to the peripheral nervous system . The paralysis will likely be permanent . I 'm sorry . [ door closes ] He 's with Izzy now . [ chuckles ] Izzy . Thank you . - Yeah . Izzy . - Yeah . He hated that dog . Of course . It was the only living thing he met that ever disobeyed him . [ chuckles ] You remember we would sit with Dad out here when we were kids , [ sniffles ] watch as he buried her bones . [ sniffles ] Yeah . [ voice breaking ] Yeah , I can 't believe he 's gone . Let 's not idolize your father because he 's dead . He wasn 't a god . He was a man ... Deeply flawed in ways you will never know . Hiro . ( Usutu ) Aaah ! No ! I understand you 've been dreaming about me . Aaah ! Hiro ! Subtitles by LeapinLar

 Previously on Heroes ... We have a problem ... Sylar . He 's gone . Nathan . What are you ... I think I 'm in trouble . Ever think that we can just live , { \ * Noah , } out in the open ? - I 'm a friend , Tracy . - What is this place ? Home . Please take this . To find your way back here . I pushed Nathan 's memories into your mind . I made your body think that it was him . I 've gotta go find Nathan . Get my body back . Then I kill every single person even remotely involved . - Police , freeze . - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm crossing that line . - You idiot , you 'll die with me . - I know . - Gun . Where is Charlie ? I 'm the only one ... who knows exactly where your sweet Charlie is . And you can save her , but only if you do exactly what I ask you to do . I made a mistake about eight weeks ago . This green earth has given us so much . - Feels good to give back what we can . - { \ * Then } Why don 't you give back Charlie ? You 're an evil man , Butterfly Man . You must release Charlie from wherever you 're holding her . I have a way for you to earn her freedom . I met a man eight weeks ago . He had something I wanted . A film from 1961 . His name was ... Mohinder Suresh . I know Dr. Suresh . I don 't need to time travel . I can find him right now . Dr. Suresh is dead . You killed Dr. Suresh . I need you to go back eight weeks . To a motel room in Texas . - To save his life ? - No , to save that film , before he destroyed it . Once you return , deliver it to me , your sweet Charlie will be set free . I don 't know if I can even time travel anymore . Then you 're gonna have to try very , very hard . Your sweet Charlie 's life depends on it . - We 're done here . - Let 's go . So ... India was connected to Australia ? As well as Madagascar and most of Southern Africa . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Now together , they made a supercontinent called Pangaea . That is until India broke off and began to migrate north . Everything keeps changing , doesn 't it ? Indeed . Come on . One of the great lessons of plate tectonics is that all things are subject to evolution , even the earth beneath our feet . Remember to read chapter six before class . Thank you , Dr. Suresh . Your students adore you , Mohinder . You were born to teach . { \ * Teaching is what you were born to do . } It does feel good to be back in the classroom again . Listen , I was thinking of making lamb biryani for dinner tonight . You promised you were going to throw this away . I am . It was delivered over a month ago . I assumed you meant immediately . Look , it 's all of my father 's work from coyote sands in the 60s . And I didn 't mean to lie to you . It 's just hard to let go . We have a good life , Mohinder . A good , simple life here . Every time you dig into your father 's research , you disappear into a rabbit hole . It only leads you to a dark place . Perhaps you 're right . You doing okay ? You 've been sitting here staring at that poster for two hours . You ever wonder what it would be like . Running off and joining a carnival ? That 'd be a dream come true . Living with a bunch of fire-breathing freaks . Just because they 're different doesn 't make them freaks . { \ * Well } Seriously , can you imagine spending your life in some trailer moving from town to town ? And you spend your life where , in some crappy diner ? I 'm sorry . { \ * Are you sure } You 're okay ? I 'm great . I 'm fantastic . My God . I 'm sorry . We 'll figure out what 's going on . { \ * If something 's going on , we 'll figure it out . } I didn 't lose my car keys , I lost a week of my life . { \ * It 's not like I lost my car keys . I lost a week of my life . } { \ * Yeah , } And you woke up in a carnival . You sure you wanna remember that ? Senator Petrelli , welcome back . It 's good to be back . Elizabeth , do me a favor . Will you get my schedule out of the front office { \ * , please } ? Sure . That was awfully casual . I 'm telling you { \ * , Pete } . It makes no sense . { \ It doesn 't make any sense . } - What 's that ? - Even if my lost weekend was just some crazy bender under the big top , a senator ... going off the grid . That ought to raise one or two alarms . Don 't you think ? Mom say anything when you talked to her ? She 's in Washington , wants to meet us here . What are you thinking ? Talk to me . I thought I had a handle on this { \ * , Pete } . But these last few weeks , it 's just been like I don 't know who I am anymore . Just the last guy I figured for an identity crisis , Nathan . - Senator ? - Go ahead . The good news is ... your day 's wide open . We cleared your calendar because of your vacation . { \ * when you went on vacation } Vacation ? Sir , your mother said you weren 't sure how long you 'd be gone , so ... My mother . Right . Thank you . Deja vu . So sorry , you startled me . Can I help you ? Ren√© ? It 's okay . - Did my mother send you ? - Don 't come any closer . I 've come here to speak with Peter . It 's okay . Come on . What are you doing here ? I came to warn you , Peter . You need to know the truth . Freeze ! It 's me , Tracy Strauss . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } And you are breaking and entering in my dad 's apartment because ? I really need to see him . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Yeah , well , that 's why God invented doorbells . I didn 't mean to . I put my hand on the doorknob and it just ... Do you know where he is ? Something is going wrong with my power . I can 't control it . I didn 't know where else to go . Tracy , you 're freezing . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } So this was my mother 's idea to clean up Nathan 's mess . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } She sends you to wipe out our memories . It 's what she wants me to do , but I cannot do it . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } { \ * Okay , and } Why is that ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Your mother is blinded by her emotions . There are some lines that should never be crossed . Why do you keep looking at him ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } It is not up to me to reveal this thing . The decision must be yours . The answer you seek ... is here . If you go , Peter , go alone . What you discover may be more terrible than you can bear . This is Dr. Chandra Suresh , and this is entry number four . { \ pos ( 250,200 ) } Coyote Sands relocation center , { \ pos ( 250,200 ) } March 5th , 1961 . I 've been trying to alert the authorities { \ * here } to the potential danger of gathering so many persons with abilities in one location . My concern ... centers around an apparent force ... small , but measurable ... { \ pos ( 260,260 ) } that emanates from all such individuals . When two or more of these forces are proximate , they amplify , exponentially , like a kind of gravity or ... magnetism . An abnormal spike in seismic activity as of late appears to be emanating from one of the individuals being held here . A pregnant woman by the name of ... This is entry number 21 . It is my intention to document the birth of the child . There has been an enormous release of seismic activity throughout the day . { \ pos ( 260,270 ) } - { \ * Doctor , } He 's crowning ! - I fear that this child may indeed ... I 'm coming ! It 's okay ! It 's okay . { \ pos ( 260,230 ) } It 's okay , don 't worry . Nurse ! You okay ? That 's better . Why is this happening to me ? { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } I thought it would be a good idea to make you some tea . You sure you 're okay ? Thanks , Claire . What happened ? The water started to freeze . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } It is happening over and over again , and I can 't stop it . { \ Tracy , } Just calm down . Try to take a deep breath . Can you hear me ? My God . One hundred and six . I really thought we were done with this cloak and dagger stuff . I still can 't figure out why the Haitian didn 't want me in the loop . Well , does it matter now ? This just gets better and better . Check it out . - Are we good ? - Good . - What do you got ? - It 's a body . What is it ? It 's me . That 's not you . Could be ... A shape-shifter or something , it 's not ... { \ * There 's got to be a reason } The Haitian wanted you to see this . This is just weird . - Don 't ... - It 's all right . You 're now Nathan Petrelli . What did you see ? Bits and pieces of things . A hotel room . Old news . { \ That guy 's } He 's been dead for weeks . I know . I know . - I heard ... Parkman . - Matt ? His voice , he was angry . Whatever 's going on , we won 't get answers from mom or the Haitian . { \ * we 're not gonna get any straight answers out of mom or the Haitian . } - { \ Okay , So } We gotta find Matt . - Where is he ? - L.A. - Let 's go find him . You sure ? I 'm not sure of anything . I gotta get you in the bath . Gotta get you in . No , I heal . I heal . It 's , like , what I do . You think you ever really know somebody ? God , are you hearing yourself ? Okay , you know what I see when I look at all this ? I see the big brother that would let me win by a nose when we would race . I see the naval officer who would rearrange his leave . So that I could have a good birthday . And the past couple years , I 've seen the guy that 's saved my ass more than a few times . - I made a lot of mistakes . - So have I. Don 't beat yourself up over it . Senator Petrelli . I found something . I just hope this isn 't the Matt Parkman you 're looking for . He 's in a hospital in Texas under guard . They 're saying he tried to commit suicide by cop . Thank you , Elizabeth . Multiple gunshot wounds . He 's in critical condition . You know , Nathan , I can heal people now . If we could get in , I think I can save him . I 'm trying . You can do this , Hiro . I have faith in you . Mira . I 've made a remarkable discovery . There 's a power , an actual quantifiable force ... You promised me , Mohinder . Mira , this is important . Using my father 's equations , I built a device , a sort of compass that I can use to ... Will you listen to yourself ? You 're possessed again by these voices in your head . { \ Mira , } You don 't understand . By following this compass ... If the child on that film is still alive , and surrounds himself with a large enough number of specials , - he can become the most pow ... - Stop . I 'm begging you , Mohinder . Please think very carefully about what you have , about what you have to lose . I love you . But if you disappear again , I will not wait for you to return . - Can you help him ? - I can try . You 're okay . You 're okay . It 's me , Peter . - What happened ? - You 're okay . Good things do come to those who wait . - Son of a bitch , get out of my head . - { \ * You 're in the hospital , } I brought you back . No , you don 't understand . This is exactly what he wants . - What 's he talking about ? - Bring him closer , Parkman . One touch is all I need . Then you can have your miserable life back . I can have my body back . Shut up ! You guys , run . Get away from me before he comes back . Before who comes back ? { \ - Sylar . } - Sylar 's dead { \ , Matt } . - No , he 's in my head . He 's trying to con ... control my mind . I know this sounds crazy , but if he controls me , if he gets my power , he 's gonna jump back into his body . Whoa , whoa . Slow down , Matt . What do you mean , " his body " ? This should be good . Nathan , you 're ... you 're dead . Sylar murdered you , he cut your throat . I used my power to purge his mind from his body and put your thoughts in . You 're weakening , Parkman . I 'm not gonna let you do this . I don 't have time for all the five stages of grief . Let 's go right from denial to acceptance . Oh , my ... Oh , my God , you son of a bitch . It 's true . I 'm so sorry . - Stay back . - You 're saying I 'm Sylar ? Yes . But I can make it all right . All you need to do is take my hand . All you need to do is take my hand . - Don 't . Don 't take his hand . - It all makes sense , Pete . - { athan , } Get away from him . - Stop ! It all adds up . - These new powers aren 't mine . - Stop . They 're sylar 's . I don 't exist . Doesn 't make sense . I don 't buy that . Take my hand { \ , Nathan } . He 's controlling you ! Take my hand now . Do it { \ , take my hand } . I 'll kill you first . It 's okay , Pete . Matt 's right . It 's time to end it . One touch , Nathan . And it 's over . No , don 't touch him . You touch him , he 's got my power . His mind 'll go back into his body . Stop . Stop ! You ! Back away from the prisoner . Take my hand , do it now . - I said , get away . - Back away ! { athan , } Where is he ? Nathan , where is he ? Pete , come here . We gotta get out of here . No ! Nathan ! Nathan , is he in you ? You son of a bitch , is he in you ? They 're in here ! Can I help you with something ? I hope so . I 'm looking for someone who may or may not even exist . If he does , his name would be Samuel Sullivan . I 'm Joseph Sullivan , proprietor . The man you are looking for is my brother . Come with me . If my evidence is correct , your brother may be capable of magnifying his powers . Simply by being near others with abilities . Powers , abilities . I 'd like to help you , doctor . But I 'm afraid I have no idea what you 're talking about . I thought you were going to build a fire . Figured ... Edgar and Damian could handle that . I 'm Samuel . Samuel Sullivan ? Dr. Suresh here has a few questions for me . He 's writing a book on the life of traveling carnies . People wanna read a thing like that ? It 's a colorful and exotic world . Why don 't you join the others at the fire pit . I 'm sure they could use your help . Yeah , of course . I 've just traveled 8,000 miles to speak with your brother . If you 're gonna try and stop me , you 'd better have a damn good reason . Please . Come inside . { \ Oh , uh , } When you came { \ * in the room } , I was already dead . You don 't remember seeing anyone else in that room . You took me to the morgue . And that 's all you remember . { \ Oh , } And do me a favor . Take off all your clothes . - { \ Oh , } Let me give you my clothes . - Yeah , good idea . Hurry up , let 's go { \ , let 's go } . Come on . Why are we here , Nathan ? I shouldn 't be around people right now . Something happened to me out there { \ , Pete } . What ? I nearly put you through a wall with a flick of my hand . If Sylar gets into my head , the way he got into Parkman 's ... I can 't risk that with you . There 's a road around here somewhere . You 'll find your way home . - What are you doing ? - What are you doing ? Go ahead . I 'll be right behind you . { \ * The images on } That film leaves little doubt . - Your brother 's destruction power ... { \ The destruction your brother is capable of cannot be ... } - I 'm aware of what he 's capable of . But Samuel himself has no idea . And it 's been my life 's work to keep it that way , to keep him in the dark about the true nature of his power . Soon after our release from internment at Coyote Sands , my mother told me the truth about Samuel . You saw it on film . My mother lived it . She knew exactly how dangerous he could become . I 've kept our community small in number to ensure Samuel 's power remains subdued . I love my brother . But he 's become a man of great ambition . Somewhere inside , he can taste it , the immense potential he was born with . Under the right circumstances , your brother 's powers could increase a thousand-fold . - The information on that film ... - Burn the film ! Go back to India . We must do everything possible to keep this genie in a bottle . How do I know I can trust you ? I have watched over him for 40 years , and everything 's been just fine . You 're no longer welcome here . Mira , it 's me . You were right . This was all a mistake . I should have left that film in the trash . I should have left that box unopened . I miss you . I 'll be on the next plane home . Be careful , Dr. Suresh . Evil butterfly man will be coming for you . You know , you have not lost control of your abilities in over an hour . Whatever 's happening with you , I don 't think it 's physical . It 's psychological . Great . I panic attack with powers . When did it start ? Just this morning . I was sitting in this diner thinking about ... About what ? About changing everything . My entire life . I 've been so lost , Claire . I tried so hard , to put my old life back together , but once I did , nothing fit anymore . Then I met this ... strange man named Samuel . He lives with a group of people ... Who all have abilities . Yeah , I met him too . He invited me to join them , to move to this place where ... we 're all accepted . I think I might do it . Give up everything . Just start a new life . Maybe you should . Maybe that 's what your body is telling you it wants . It 's great to have someone to talk to about all this . It 's hard to find a friend out there in the normal world . Someone you can trust . Yeah . I had something like that , but I 'm pretty sure that 's over . Oh , it just sounded so good on paper . College . Now I 'm starting to wonder if ... It 's hard out there , for girls like us . Ladies . How was your day ? Oh , you know . Same old same old . I need to know what was on that film . It 's about my ability , isn 't it ? A way for me to increase my power a thousand-fold . Tell me ! Your brother warned me about you . After all these years , he 's been betraying me ? Holding me back so that he could keep playing the king . This is your last chance . Tell me what 's on that film . Never . I will learn the truth . And I will do everything I can to stop you . I 'm sorry . Hello , old friend . I am not the Hiro Nakamura you know . - I have come 8 weeks from the future . - To save my life ? To save this film . In the future I come from , you were dead . I was murdered right here in this room . How did you know I would need that Kevlar vest ? My time travel is not so good lately . The first time I tried , I arrived ten minutes from now . Wasn 't pretty . If I hadn 't gone right to Samuel , he would have never known the secrets of his power . My investigation has corrupted him . We have to stop him , Hiro . And we will . But first , you have to disappear for eight more weeks until he releases Charlie . Samuel is holding captive the woman I love until I deliver this film . { \ * Hiro , } This man is extremely dangerous . I can 't just go away for eight weeks while he consolidates his power . Please . If he knew I spared your life , he will never release Charlie . I understand your concern , and I appreciate all that you 've done { \ * for me } . But our primary focus must be stopping Samuel . I won 't { \ * will not } risk Charlie 's life . Well then , we 'll have to agree to disagree , Hiro . If you will not disappear until Charlie is safe , then I will have to make you disappear . What do you mean ? Sorry . He used to say , " Put your finger in a bucket of water , pull it out , " and see how fast that hole fills up . " Thanks a lot . Your have your film . Now I want Charlie . Soon . Sorry your friend had to die . Mr. Ahmadi , time for your medication . My name is Mohinder Suresh . My name is Mohinder ... Janice , honey , it 's me . { \ * Look , } This is tough to explain into a machine . Remember , { \ * I told you } there was a guy inside my head taking control of my mind , a monster named Sylar ? Well , I just want to let you know the craziness over the last few weeks is finally over . And ... Sylar 's gone . He 's gone back into his own body . I think he got what he wanted . I 'm not really sure what I 'm doing here . Not even sure I hope to find a ... I just know that I can 't go on living my old life anymore . I 'm glad you called , Tracy . I 'd hoped you would . I felt a real connection between us . There 's something I 'm gonna ask of you . A way for you to use your gifts to help make this a better world for all people of abilities . Together , we can accomplish great things . You have unique talents , Tracy . Nathan , this ... This idea , this thought that you 're ... Sylar . Change the voice , chance the face , still him underneath . These hands have killed dozens of people , Pete . Friends of ours . Whoever Nathan Petrelli was , he 's gone now . Just some random thoughts in a mass murderer 's head . Okay , look , assuming that I believe any of that . What would it matter ? I mean , didn 't Matt say that he forced Sylar out ? You really think Matt could purge every sick thought from that head ? To the rest of the world , I 'm Nathan Petrelli , Pete . But every time you look at me , the way you 're looking at me right now , you 're gonna see Sylar . Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me I 'm wrong , Pete . { \ fad ( 500,500 ) } { \ * TO BE CONTINUED ... }

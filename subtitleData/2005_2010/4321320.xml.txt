 Is he okay ? - Hey . Who is it ? Hello ? Who is this ? Excuse me . Are you okay ? It 's car v. Car . N.Y.P.D. ' s taking witness statements now . What happened to the drivers ? - Hey , you got the case . So who 's our man ? Who was driving this vehicle ? Walter , I don 't need you to make me anything . I insist . You know , there 's something you don 't know about me , son . What 's that ? Once you enter a grocery store , you never leave again ? No . Before I became chair of Biochemistry at Harvard which was after Oxford and MIT I was sous-chef at the Bakersfield Food Lab . - Sous-chef ? - Yeah . Well , technically . I worked under Seymour Brodien . Am I supposed to know who that is ? - He invented the Ho Ho . - Ha . Of course he did . Walter , I want to leave this place . I don 't need you to make me a cake . I 'm not . I 'm making you a custard . It 's my specialty . I don 't like custard . In fact , I 've never liked custard . As a boy , you loved it . You 've just forgotten . Now , Friday is your birthday . You deserve something wonderful . Well , for my birthday can I have getting the hell out of here ? We need to celebrate . And make sure that Agent Dunham can attend . I want to see her face when she eats my pudding . That 's disturbing . Peter Bishop . What ? - Mr. Bishop ? - Yeah . - Agent Jessup . Hi . - Hi . This is my father , Walter . - I have a couple questions ... - How bad is she ? - We don 't know . - Excuse me ? - How do you not now ? JESSUP : Can you explain what you do ? - You 're some sort of special consultants ? - Where 's Charlie ? - Charlie who ? Charlie Francis . Where is he ? He 's en route from Quantico . I 'm the agent in charge . Agent in charge , where 's Olivia Dunham ? Witnesses report after the crash , a man was seen leaving the car but no one saw anyone leave the SUV . The doors are still locked . The seat belt 's buckled . The airbag 's deployed . There 's no indentation , which implies no one was behind the wheel at the moment of impact . - Do these skid marks match ? You still haven 't told me what you do . You , Dunham , your father . - The field office said all your work is ... - Classified . And you don 't have access . I don 't have time for this . JESSUP : It 's not that I don 't appreciate petulance . Oh , my . I 'd love to cooperate . As soon as you can find me an agent who can help me . Female . Unconscious . Dislocated right hip . Possible brain herniation . BPs jumping 180 / 20 . - Pupils are nonreactive . - Coding . Prep her . Stat . Amy Jessup . Special Agent Broyles . - We need to talk about what happened . - Sir , she ... What happened , junior agent , is all right here in your report . A random traffic accident involving a federal agent . No extenuating circumstances . Case closed . Sign it , please . - But this girl ... - Sign the report , agent . That 's an order . Walter . I 'm afraid your friend 's injuries were too severe . Come on . We were unable to restore any brain function . Patients who suffer this kind of head trauma simply don 't regain consciousness . Simple . Reductive . Absurd . Life and death , these are relative terms . Contextually defined , dependant on cultural specifics . - Walter . - He is undoubtedly indulging in primitive diagnostics . Agent Dunham is not dead . She 's not dead . She 's not dead . - Walter ... - She 's not . - Walter . Walter , wait . - Stop . You can 't go back ... Doctor , please . Back off . I 'm so sorry . Mind if I join you ? I 'm guessing you don 't drink . Double . - How did you find me ? - I work for the FBI . Where 's your father ? My father is off in la-la land . Mixed himself up a really nice cocktail of Valium , Haldol Seconal , and I think , lorazepam . Astrid is babysitting . I 've been called to Washington tomorrow . The efficacy of the division is being questioned . I 've been informed that our failure to deliver any usable results is unacceptable . They 're shutting you down ? What were we even doing , anyway ? We 'd sit around and wait for somebody to die of some grisly , macabre death or for the entire fabric of the universe to come shredding apart . We were the cleanup crew . Sent in to mop it up and make sure it was all neat and tidy for the file . - We were always too late , anyway . - That 's not entirely true . We were too late for Olivia . To Agent Dunham . To Agent Dunham . Hey , Rach . - When did you get back ? - A few hours ago . Ella 's at a friend 's house . I didn 't want her to remember her aunt like this . She had a living will . No life-support . They 're gonna do this in the morning . So I 've just been sitting with her and ... Do you wanna ? Yes . You know , she liked you , Peter . Did you know that ? Hey . Goodbye , Olivia . DOCTOR : Can you tell me your name ? - It 's Olivia Dunham . - Do you know the year ? - Why am in the hospital ? My leg ? You were in an accident . Do you remember ? In New York ? - Is Peter here ? I need to see ... - He 's here . He 's here . Hi . L ... I went somewhere . - I know . You went to New York . - No . - Yeah , but no . - Olivia , look , you were in an accident . No . No . I was trying to get somewhere . And someone was trying to stop me . But I went there anyway and ... Oh , God , what is happening ? DOCTOR : Mr. Bishop , please , she needs to stay calm . - He told me something . - Who ? I don 't know . I can 't remember . But , oh , it was very important . - There 's something I have to do . - Who told you to do what ? I don 't know , but there 's something that I have to do and I ... - I think that our lives may depend on it . - Whose lives ? - Everyone 's . - That beta blocker . Get her pulse down . Peter , I need my gun . Please . I 'm not safe . Somebody hurt me . They did this to me . Please , Peter , my gun . I need my gun . Please , Peter . Excuse me . I need to speak with Special Agent Broyles . Agent Broyles is in Washington . Ugh . Then Agent Francis , please . Charlie Francis . Sir , what is this regarding ? Look , I work for you guys . I 'm a consultant . I need access to a file on a car accident yesterday in New York City . I 'm sorry , these credentials have been revoked , Mr. Bishop . What ? Look , lady , you need to help me . Feel free to file a civilian request on our website or ... No , listen to me . One of your agents is in the hospital . Her life depends on work I need to do , so find me somebody who can help me . Okay , sir , if you 'd exit the building ... JESSUP : I 'll take him . I 'm with her . What are you doing in Boston ? You like to fight , Mr. Bishop ? All that time in Iraq , Mob connections . You 've got quite a combative history . You said you were gonna help me get that file . - It 's on the seat behind you . - What ? Something wasn 't adding up about those skid marks . They were darkest in the back , not the front . So maximum torque farthest away from the incident . - The driver wasn 't slowing down . - He was speeding up . Then he must have been waiting . Those are pictures from the surveillance camera adjacent to the accident site . George Reed , 524 Littlefield Road , here in Lexington . We 're 15 minutes away . All right , now it 's your turn . What 's the Fringe Division ? What do you people do ? Nothing . Not anymore . FBI . George Reed ? Mr. Reed ? Body . Look at his lividity . If this guy was driving a car in New York , it wasn 't yesterday . I need to get a ride for someone . Feel his anus . It 's soaking wet . Expansion of the oral mucosa . The eyes and the rectum accommodate rapid fluid loss . If it 's a virus , it obviously doesn 't affect birds . Or people . At least not quickly . Agent , I need this body taken back to my lab . Hey , lunatic , this body 's going to the morgue . - Is he crazy ? - Peter ? - Who is the agent in charge here ? - I am . Take it wherever he wants . Lovely . - Is he crazy ? - Oh , yeah . JESSUP : Whatever Fringe Division is , or was , FBI says it 's been shut down . And yet I just sent you a body . Which does beg the question : Why are you doing this ? I 'm just following the case . It doesn 't pay to bluff a bluffer , Agent Jessup . You know , a lot of people would be scared by this . Most , actually . There are more things in heaven and Earth than are dreamt ... Oh , wow . Really ? Butchered Shakespeare ? Peter . Peter . They said I can ride in the back with the body . - Can I ? - Sure . Of course you can . Stay out of the medications , though . Please . I think I 've been waiting for you people my whole life . I 'll be with you in just a minute . So what can I do you for ? I 'm looking for a Selectric . Selectric 251 . Doesn 't exist . They never made one . - It 's , uh , 245 straight to 255 . - I know . I 'm still gonna need the 251 . Ah . You 're one of them . You know , it 's been six years . I just kind of figured that ... Straight back . Last door . Hey . You ... You tell them I 'm not waiting around forever . Running , running , waiting around forever . JESSUP : What are we doing here ? As I 'm sure you 're aware , my father was a scientist . JESSUP : Who was sent to St. Claire 's . A mental institution , yes , but there is more . Worse . And some good too . It 's complicated . For now , all you need to know is that this building is where he used to work . He was a working here as a professor . Simultaneously , he was working on top-secret government projects . We do our thing down here in the lab because according to him it 's the only place that he can work . You 're coming up on your last chance to turn back . Are you kidding ? Agent Jessup welcome to Fringe Division . - Astrid , Amy . Amy , Astrid . Nice haircut . - Thanks . - Hi . - Hello . Oh , hello , again . I need four Bunsen burners eight metal bowls , yay big , and a freezer . - Bowls need to be sterilized ? - It 's not for the autopsy . It 's for the custard for Peter 's birthday . Walter , will you forget about the custard ? I refuse . Also , rib cutters , toothed forceps and a bone saw . For the autopsy , not for the groceries . CHARLIE : I got here as fast as I could . - I 'm all right . You didn 't have to come all this way . - You 're not all right . - Charlie , I 'm fine . My second year with , uh , Brooklyn P. D one night we get a domestic disturbance call . Partner and I go over to his house . I 'm with the guy , right . And he 's , uh saying it 's nothing . You know , just a little argument . My partner calls from the other room and says that we need an ambulance for the girl . And I just know the guy beat the crap out of his girlfriend . So I go for my gun , I get him on the ground , and I 'm cuffing him and I hear a gunshot from the other room . I turn around and this , uh bloody girl brutalized , brutalized girl is , um aiming a gun at me . What I didn 't know at the time was , she just killed my partner . She fires , hits me in my chest . Anyway , um I 'm in ICU for six days , you know , and , uh , hospital for two weeks . Kept on telling my wife , " I 'm fine . " I was shaken , and I was scared . Now , if you 're like me you got a gun underneath your pillow . Peter called me . Hey . You can fool the doctors , kiddo . Can 't fool me . I don 't know what happened to me . I 'm so scared . I can 't even load it . My hand won 't stop shaking . Charlie , I can 't ... I can 't even load it . You 're gonna be all right . You 're gonna be all right . It 's a shame . These lungs were in excellent condition once . - Is the half-and-half boiling ? - Yeah , just about . Mix the eggs , sugar and salt in a separate bowl . Please . Walter , there 's nothing wrong with the blood sample . What are you thinking ? It 's funny . I love custard , but I hate flan . Which could be an issue of semantics , but ... Or difficulty with the French , which I doubt given my near-obsession with moules ? la crème Normandie . Well , that 's fascinating , but what I actually meant was are there any theories about how this man died ? No . The water expulsion , though , dramatic and messy seems to be a symptom of some other process . But I stumbled upon something that did the unthinkable . Look inside the mouth . You can come closer , dear . Look at the soft palate . What do you see ? There are three markings . Indents like stab wounds . What are they ? While we 're at it , what do you mean " something that does the unthinkable " ? It made me remember something . JESSUP : Is this you ? - Yeah . My father recently took a little trip down memory lane , and for no reason has become wildly obsessed with my childhood . He also likes to make sure I 'm still breathing when he thinks I 'm asleep . - Which is a little creepy . - Focus , please . This is an experiment that Belly and I did . We came up with such a spectacular blend of drugs one day , Leary came by , and he said , " You 're kidding me . " Is this gonna make her head explode or something ? In a sense , yes , but not physically . We 're trying to augment her fifth , sixth and seventh chakras . Throat , third-eye and crown . - That is correct , Astrix . - Astrid . Communication , speech , clairaudience , cognition and thought . - Spirituality . I can see him . You wanted her to see God . Who is he ? - The man with the machine ? The three ... The three nails . The three nails go in the mouth . There . Oh , yes , a soldier . From somewhere else . Ha , ha . He 's ... He 's from a place that looks like this , but it 's not here . Oh , he 's ... He 's from another universe , man . Oh , I can see it . He pushes up the machine . Pushes up the machine ? - Oh , yes , in the mouth . And then he changes . That 's how they change . They 're like shape-shifters . That 's how they hide . They can look like us . They can look like any of us . Astrid , I need you to log onto the joint law-enforcement database . We need to be informed of any corpse that matches that description . They can look like any of us . SENATOR 1 : Unsubstantiated claims of invasion . Reports of technology run amok . The old X designation and your Fringe investigations have been indulgences in the federal budget for over half a century . Well , the salad days are over , Mr. Broyles . - Colonel . - Excuse me ? Or special agent . As you 'd prefer , senator . SENATOR 2 : Colonel Broyles . Phillip , listen . We all have a job here , and we ... Yes , senator , I have a job . The same job I have had in three administrations and six wars : To defend our national security . And I assure you , we are not secure . Yes , sometimes a threat is familiar , but I have come to learn that sometimes , it is far worse , and when it is worse when the threat is unimaginable , that is when we are at the door . And you should thank God for that . Phillip , without something usable something to support the human and fiscal cost ... I 'm sorry . If your appearance is any indication ... I don 't have to tell you how important it is that Fringe Division not be shut down . - I 'm not the one who needs convincing . - We 've tried . I 'm afraid that this one is out of our hands . Do what you always used to do , Phillip . Save the day . - Feds ? - Yeah . That 's us . Well , her technically . But say us . Where 's the body that triggered the alert ? The one that has the three holes in its mouth ? It 's right over there . Thank you . JESSUP : They found this guy two blocks from the accident . Shape-shifters must leave the original body behind . Do you remember the girl from the video ? She said he was a soldier . My father was a soldier . They do one thing , life or death . They stay on mission . These killings weren 't random . Which means , this man , this thing , whatever it 's still trying to accomplish its goal . - Olivia . Oh , my God , you scared me to death . We 've sent his description to security and dispatched all available agents . He 's there , we 'll get him . - You 're looking better . - Thank you . I 'm starting to feel a little bit more like me . - So how 's your memory ? - It 's still all just fragments . I remember going to New York . I remember driving . But I can 't seem to see anything past that . Happens with head injuries . People can lose days before an accident . The best thing to do is just to keep trying , Olivia . I was on my way somewhere to meet with someone . And I guess someone hit my car . - But ... - But ? Doesn 't make any sense . Mm-hm . It 's as if I went somewhere and talked to someone . And then came back to the accident . Do you remember who you were going to meet with ? No . Almost . - He told me something . - What ? - Go on . - I can 't , uh ... Try . - Something 's hidden . - Yes . Where ? - L ... I can 't ... - Where is it hidden ? I can 't remember . - That 's really all you know , then , isn 't it ? - Yeah . Okay . We have surveillance of your suspect entering . - Olivia 's room ? - The floor 's locked up . The only person allowed in is the nurse . Don 't fight it . It 's over . Agent Francis , suspect is now white female , black hair , scrubs , gray sweater . She 's jumped down to the loading dock , heading into the basement . - You okay ? - Go get that bitch . Whoa ! Whoa , whoa . - Charlie ! Hey , you okay ? You hit ? CHARLIE : I 'm good . - So who was she ? - Walter thinks that she was a shape-changing soldier from another universe . He thinks that might be where you went . Hm . Think it 's a bad sign that I can say that , and neither of us thinks I 'm crazy ? She thought I knew where something was hidden . No matter what happened to you and no matter where you went Walter will figure it out . - Olivia , I need to ask you something . - Sure . You said that to me just after you woke up . Do you remember it ? No . - Latin ? - Mm-mm . Greek . My mother used to say that every night before I went to bed . There really isn 't a point where things just can 't get weirder , is there ? What does it mean ? It means " be a better man than your father . " Walter was already gone . It was like a code between my mother and me . It meant keep your people close . Take care of the people you care about . Well , you 're good at that . It 's good to see you again , Olivia Dunham . It 's good to see you too . NURSE : It 's time to check your vitals . You should get some rest . Peter . Is it true that they 're shutting us down ? No . - Agent Broyles . - Mr. Bishop . At the bar you said they needed to see results . Yeah . Walter says this tech isn 't from here . And that it 's broken . But it is proof . And if they can fix it they can have an army who can look like anyone they want them to . Tell them you can get this tech , they can have it . But they are not shutting us down . From now on , we 're calling the shots . We 're done reacting . We 're not gonna be too late anymore . After all , somebody 's gotta save their asses , right ? You surprise me , Mr. Bishop . Thanks . - Happy birthday , Peter ! - Happy birthday , Peter ! Ha-ha-ha . Look , custard ! Happy birthday , Peter . Happy birthday , Peter .

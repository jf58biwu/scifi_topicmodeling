 It 's a day of high emotion as we open our doors to a nation from beyond our imagination . The captains of our 29 ships are present . The Visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . There 's others out there like me . We 'll help . There were hundreds of images being captured by the damn jackets . why don 't they just annihilate us and get it over with ? They need us for something . We want to provide complete medical services to all . John May started the Fifth Column ... The first group of Visitors to ever turn against the leadership . The Fifth Column says hello . - Georgie , this is Erica . - I brought a friend . - Hello . - Hello . Tyler 's the one . You should use him . You 're doing an excellent job . Thank you , mother . Georgie . I feel like I 've been doing a lot of talking . * - Sorry about that . - No , it 's ... it 's okay . We 're ... we 're grateful . You know so much more about the v 's than we do . Been doing this a long time . They came after me when I first found out about them . I got away . My family didn 't . Jack told me . I 'm sorry . How do you know so much about them ? Been doing this even longer than Georgie . Look , we all know why we 're here . We need to hit them back for what they did to us at the warehouse . We don 't have enough people to hit anyone back . We don 't need a lot of people . We just need to get our hands on a V. Then what ? Then we cut it open and we show the world what 's underneath . If we do that , they got no choice but to retaliate . That 's just a war we can 't win . They 'd wipe us out . Georgie , no one 's backing down , but we have to be smart about how we fight . You didn 't answer my question before . How do you know so much about the V 's ? You got nothing to worry about with Ryan . He saved my ass at the warehouse . If it wasn 't for him , I 'd be dead right now . Why ? Why didn 't you just tell them that you 're a V ? It 's a priest and an FBI agent . What , you can 't trust them ? What is wrong with you ? I better not ever hear you talk about skinning a V again . His name was Dale Maddox , a sleeper agent we had installed in the New York FBI office . And you 're telling me he was murdered aboard my ship ? Yes . In the medical bay . We 've never had a murder any of our ships . Who would do such a thing ? There are rumors of traitors aboard ... Fifth Column . We can 't afford any kind of dissonance among our people . Joshua , assemble a team immediately and find out who did this . Hi , sweetheart . You working ? Can I talk to you for a minute ? Absolutely . Can you give me two minutes ? ... than the Visitors ' high commander , Anna . I understand you have some exciting news to share with us today . We do , Chad . We 're announcing a new program that will spread the miracles of our healing centers - to countless people . - Do you know when she 'll be back ? Well , is there another doctor I can see ? No , it 's all right . Yeah , thanks anyway . - You all right ? - I feel like crap . You know , there 's that nasty bug that 's going around . No , it 's these meds . They 're making me so tired . I 'm trying to get ' em changed , but Dr. Soder 's out of town till next week . - Maybe I should just stop taking them . - No , you can 't just stop - taking heart medication . - I know . I 'll be fine . I 've just got a couple of clients today , so I 'm gonna take it easy . Okay . - You need anything , you let me know , okay ? - I will . - Love you . - I love you . Which brings me to today 's announcement . Our physicians are able to treat a number of human ailments , but preventative medicine is also important . We 've developed an injection ... call it a vitamin supplement ... designed to strengthen the immune system . Not just strengthen it , I 'm told , but supercharge it to help fight off numerous forms of cancer , other diseases , even stave off the effects of aging . All true . We 'll be offering the injections around the clock at our healing centers in the days to come . Any chance you 're gonna cure the common cold for us ? Your flu shots will have to suffice . I 'm afraid even we haven 't cracked the common cold . I guess even the V 's have their limitations . Anna , thank you so much for being with us . Mom ... it 's been , like , way more than two minutes . Yeah . Um ... yes . Sorry . - Hi . - Hey . I 'm all yours . Okay ... okay . It 's ... it 's about the girl you met last night ... Lisa . Half-naked girl in my son 's room Lisa . - Mom . - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Do you ... okay . O ... okay . I 'm not gonna get it . I wanna hear . I 'm not gonna get it . It 's work . I mean , you should take it . It 's fine . Will you hold on for a second ? 'Cause I will get rid of ' em . - Okay ? Evans . - Yeah , it 's Ryan . Yeah , I 'm gonna need to call you back. what ? no , this can 't wait . - No , Ty . Bubba . What ... - No , mom , seriously , it ... it 's fine . - No , I 'm ... I can ... I w ... - Well , we 'll talk about it later . We can ... - Yeah . - We need to meet ... right now . This thing that Anna 's calling a vitamin injection ... - She 's lying . - How do you know ? A couple years ago , I took out a cell of V scientists . They were working on an injection . They tried to mass produce and distribute it among humans . If you 're gonna put something harmful into a vitamin , then why do you go on television , make such a big deal about it ? Anna wouldn 't make an announcement like this if it wasn 't something big . I know what I 'm talking about . They 've reactivated this plan . So they 're gonna what ... they 're gonna take us out one shot at a time ? No , this is part of something that 's ... that 's just much bigger . Now I know the names of the V 's that were involved the last time . Some of them survived . Maybe you can run ' em through the FBI , see who 's still out there . - Mm . This isn 't getting us anywhere . - Is that all of them ? Yeah . No . Try Peter Combs . He was a lab assistant , pretty low level . That 's him . Professor of chemistry ? Not low level anymore . - This Peter Combs ... he 's a V ? - He 's a V. Yeah , I say we track him down and find out what he 's up to . - How about we just take him out ? - Taking out one V is not gonna get us anywhere . If we follow him , he 'll lead us to a bigger part of the puzzle . Seriously , that 's the plan ? Follow him ? That 's the plan . I can 't talk to my mom anymore . I 've tried telling her about this girl I met ... She won 't give me two seconds . She doesn 't trust me . She just keeps on telling me , " stay away from the V 's . " And you don 't know how to tell her that the V 's are important to you ? She doesn 't want to hear it . Look ... I joined the peace ambassadors . If my mom knew , she would go ballistic . She thinks the V 's are evil . And how do you see them ? The world 's broken . They 're fixing it . All we do is , we get in their way . They got these healing centers . The things they can do ... Have you been down there to the healing centers ? No . Not yet . Why ? I just ... I 've been tempted myself to check them out . I hear you have to wait months though . Well , I mean , if you really wanna go , I ... I might be able to help . I ... I kinda know someone . That 's really sweet of you , Tyler . I might actually take you up on that . I hear they 're curing blindness , helping handicapped people walk , all these great things , and ... My mom will never know because she won 't even talk to one . You know , I shouldn 't even care . I 'm gonna be 18 in a month , and then after that I won 't have to deal with any of this . - Your mom doesn 't stop being your mom because you 're 18 . - Yeah . Well , I feel like she stopped being by mom a long time ago . I thought it might take longer , but I think Tyler 's ready . Good . Bring him up to the ship . Tell him I wanna meet him . - = It 's Only The Beginning = - Thank you again for doing this report on our healing centers . It 's not like I had much of a choice . Anna wouldn 't do the interview with me unless I did this . That was amazing . And that 's why we want you to share our story with the world . This is Tyler . Leave a message . Still can 't get ahold of him ? He 's mad at me . Ah . You wanna talk about it ? - I do not . - Okay . Hello ? Hey , it 's Ryan . We 're set . Class is out in 15 minutes . When Combs heads to his car , we got him covered . I 'm on the ground floor . Georgie 's upstairs . I 'm checking in with Georgie now . You 've interviewed all of the medical staff ? Extensively . We couldn 't find anyone who could shed any light on the murder . How many of your staff were on duty that day ? 14 , maybe 15 . Gather them . - They 've already been questioned . - I understand that . Gather them anyway . - You have to get off the ship . - I am not running . You 're too important . The column needs you . You 'll carry on , and so will the others . No , you cannot be sacrificed no matter what . I won 't let it happen . Hey , Combs . I 'm gonna cut you open and show the world what you are . Get the car . Georgie . You need to pressure on that wound . What the hell happened ? He just started shooting at me . We need to get him some help . I 'm gonna take care of Combs . - What happened ? - I don 't know yet . Thought you gonna wait to start a ? * ? - You got him ? - I got him . I 'll take care of Georgie . - Just be safe . - You , too . Did you think you were gonna get away ? Huh ? You thought you were gonna get away this time . You can 't stop us , filthy traitor ! No ! No ! You 're a Visitor . What the hell is going on ? Erica , you and I want the same thing . We both want to know what Combs was doing . Except now I got nothing . You just shot him . He was gonna kill you . We 're on the same side , Erica . Everything that I 've told you is true . Except that you 're a Visitor . Never said I wasn 't . Sirens are gettin ' close . What 's it gonna be ? Hi . Uh , a friend of mine called and made an appointment for me . The diagnostic scan provides an image of every system in your body on a cellular scale ... a level of detail our medical technology can 't even begin to fathom . Okay , I 'm all set . Now for anyone who 's had an MRI or a CT scan , this scan is ... well , I gotta say , it 's kinda pleasant . Okay , cut . Check that back for me , will you , Gary ? Thank you . Getting everything you need , Mr. Decker ? Yeah . Could use a little more freedom to walk around , talk to some of the patients ... you know , alone . I understand . Tight schedule , I 'm afraid . Maybe next time . How does a priest know his way around a bullet wound ? Army chaplain . Two tours in Iraq . You and the blonde are full of surprises . You went after that V in the garage , didn 't you ? I did what was right if we want to win this thing . You got lucky . The bullet went through . Oh , yeah , I feel lucky . All right ... This is gonna hurt . You know , pretty soon , you ' gonna need to decide what you are ... a priest or a soldier . Okay , look , we 're not gonna get anywhere until you get your question out , so ... go . - What happened to Combs ? - Suicide pill . Leaves no real evidence behind , nothing but ash . All V 's carry one . Next . He called you a traitor . Are there other V 's like you fighting against Anna ? They 're called the Fifth Column . Good to know . Good . This just looks like paperwork . He would get all of his supplies from his department , right ? Probably . So what 's his connection to the lyndhurst shipping company ? Let 's go check it out . The murdered sleeper agent was a valuable asset . Had he been debriefed , he would have provided us with invaluable information . Someone prevented that from happening . Would you please join the rest ? You are a part of the medical staff , aren 't you ? Unless the guilty party steps forward to take responsibility , I 'm gonna need to choose one of you to set an example . The innocent will suffer . Last chance . Long live the Fifth Column . Joshua . As lead medical officer , you will carry out the sentence . Skin him . Am I in trouble with your mom ? - Why would you be in trouble ? - I don 't know . When you called and said she wanted to meet me , if it was my mom , I 'd be in trouble . Mine 's not like that . You guys are so much more evolved than we are . Oh , my God . That ... that 's Anna . D ... do you know her or ... Yeah . That 's my mom . Come on . Lisa 's told me all about you . She , uh , didn 't tell me , uh , a lot about you . But , uh ... but I already know a I ... lot about you , so ... I 'd like to take some time to get to know Tyler . Is that all right with you ? Sure . Don 't worry . She doesn 't bite . See you later . Excuse me . Can I talk to you for a second ? Thank you . I 'm so lost . I was looking for 5700 Gibbs , and ... and ... You know , that address is right over ... uhh ! Erica . - How 's Georgie ? - He 'll be fine . What are you doing ? Protocol nine . Tells everybody in the building to evacuate immediately . They 'll meet at a rally point off site until further notice . Should buy us some time while we 're in there . There you go . All right . Let 's do it . Lisa 's happiness has always been the highest priority for me . Right now you seem to be a big part of her life . She 's quite taken with you . Me too . I mean , you know , with her . Good . I 'm glad . I wanted to make sure you felt the same . I think it 's universal instinct for mothers to be protective of their young . Lisa mentioned you liked motorcycles . Yeah , I 'm kind of hooked on machines . Well ... I think you 'll enjoy this . This is the propulsion system we use on each of our 29 ships . This ... is the engine room . You 've gotta be kidding me . No human has ever seen this before . You are the first , Tyler . I thought you 'd like it . How could you do this ? - How could you sacrifice yourself ? - You had to be protected . You 're one of Anna 's closest advisors . That makes you the best hope for the column . I can 't move my body . I gave you something . I can 't do this . She suspects you . That 's why she 's making you do it . You have to . Joshua , do it . My death will be meaningless if you 're found out . Erica ! Come on . You gotta see this . R6 ? What the hell is R6 ? That 's what they 're putting their vitamin shot . They 're experimenting on people . Is that the vitamin shot ? - No . It 's the flu vaccine . - What , human vaccine ? They 're not mixing their drug into the vitamin shot . They 're mixing it into our flu vaccine . Shipment leaves tomorrow . They did everything from here ... tested it on humans , packaged it to look like the flu shot . When this shipment mingles with the real shots , no one will be able to tell the difference . And no government agency 's gonna be worrying about a flu vaccine when theve got a V vitamin to evaluate . Which , in all likelihood , is nothing more than a vitamin shot . They know exactly how to play us . The media bombards us with stories of epidemics , pandemics , so we run out . We get a shot to protect ourselves . That 's what the V 's are counting on ... our ... our predictability , our human nature . It 's very calculated , isn 't it ? Everything that Anna does is calculated . So what , we stop doing what makes us human ? All I 'm saying is the more predictable we are , the more vulnerable we are . I 'm gonna keep this as evidence . The rest we destroy . The diagnostic scan detected your heart condition , and it is a condition we can heal . Oh , my God . That 's wonderful . I was just looking for a change in meds . But the thing is , Ms. Stevens , the diagnostic also turned up something else . Something else ? They came back . They figured it out . They know we 're here . - You guys go . I 'll be there . - Where the hell are you going ? Every V security system has a fail-safe . * Hurry . Come on ! They 're coming ! Let 's go ! Mr. Decker . Yes ? May we have a word before you go ? Okay . I 'm sorry . I just ... I wanted to make sure I heard you right . - You think I 'm gonna die ? - Had you not come here , almost certainly . In approximately six months , you will develop a basilar artery aneurysm . But we can heal you , prevent it from developing . You wouldn 't be offended if I got a second opinion , would you ? Your technology won 't be able to detect this until it 's too late . I know this kind of news is difficult , Mr. Decker . But the science is incredibly accurate . Would you like a printout of your medical history to take with you to your second opinion ? I didn 't give you my medical history . We analyze in four dimensions ... the fourth being time . Medically we can determine what 's going to happen as well as what 's already happened . Any trauma your body sustained over the years , there 's a biological marker of it stored in every cell . We just extrapolate the data . Chicken pox at age 8 , bronchitis at 14 , a broken femur , 26 . Appendicitis at 31 and migraines your whole life . As I said , Chad , incredibly accurate . But the good news is , we can heal you . The bad news is there is a long waiting list . Though I suppose if you 're open to it , we could work something out . It may not be anything more than a hiccup to Anna , but tonight we landed a punch . Yeah , we did . Speaking of punches , father , you got a hell of a right hook . That V didn 't see it coming . You guys gonna be okay getting home ? - Yeah , we 'll manage . - Yeah . We made a difference tonight . Our plan is beginning to take hold . Lisa was right . Tyler is the one . What is it ? The warehouse containing all of the r6 compound has been lost . - How ? - In an explosion . It 's all been destroyed . It was sabotage . We received a message from the warehouse moments before . * Word has spread quickly . Every ship has heard . There was already a growing concern , but now there is real fear . Then we 'll have to manage their fear . Remind everyone that even amid talk of the Fifth Column ... of John May ... they have me . No need for regrets , for mistakes made yesterday . The past is gone . No looming fate , no uncontrollable destiny . No hunger . No sickness . No fear . No death . Nothing ahead . Nothing behind . Just stillness ... Light ... warmth . The pain you felt , the pain that you may have caused others ... it 's behind you . Now looking back . no fear of what will come . Just the pulse of time , invigorating , soothing , bask in my light . Take comfort knowing I am here . You will never be alone . What was that ? A gift from my mother . We call it Bliss . - Hey , sweetheart , I 'm home . - I 'm in here . You all right ? How you feeling ? Okay . I got some news today . What 's wrong ? I didn 't believe it , so I had to confirm it . I wasn 't tired ' cause of my meds . I 'm pregnant . We 're gonna have a baby ! Pretty soon you need to decide what you are ... A priest or a soldier . Father Travis ? Father Travis ? Who are you ? How 'd you get in here ? The door was open . I need to talk . I 'm sorry , it 's I ... it 's late . You 're gonna have to leave . I 'm desperate . Look , I 'm here tomorrow . We ... we can talk tomorrow . What is it that you need ? Are you ... Jack ? Jack ! Tyler ? Ty ? Ty ! " Can 't believe you were invited up to the V ship ! " Is everything okay , Tyler ? Everything 's fine . Mm . Beautiful , isn 't it ? It must be awesome seeing space from one of these ships . Maybe one day you will . What you 've seen today , Tyler ... is only the beginning .

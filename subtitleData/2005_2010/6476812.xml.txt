 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes . And you 've got to be ready . - Diane Holmes . - How have you done this to me ? Love , you 're always at its mercy . Hate to break it to you , but you 're not my first . Anti-Weevil spray . Hand clamps . Come on , let 's make this easy for both of us . This always happens when I give them the night off . It 's not even really medium , let alone well done . French place , you see ? Hey , remember that weekend in Paris ? The little place with the wood paneling ... They barely even waved the steak under the grill and you said ... - Why are you looking at me like that ? - Sorry , like what ? Like you 'd rather be somewhere else . It 's becoming the norm , innit ? I 'm chopsing away , I look up and you 're just absent . - What 's happening to us , Gwen ? - I know , I 'm sorry . Is it something I 've done , or not done ? What the hell was that ? - Oh , God , what 's happened to you ? - Rhys , is it ? Nice to meet you . Sorry , dude , kind of an emergency . I 'll have her back for dessert . Come on . Hold on , sunshine . That 's my girlfriend . - Rhys , this is Jack ... - Sit down , Gwen . - He 's my boss ! - Sit the fuck down ! Don 't ever speak to me like that . Come on , Gwen . Let 's go . Hey , she 's with me tonight . One night off . You promised . Don 't you dare . If you go now , Gwen ... Sorry for cutting in , but I 've been having a little trouble with this one . Rhys will get over it . He always does . You promised to keep hold of your life . Don 't let it drift . 300 metres on the right , car park . Jack ! Over there ! Get him in , get him in ! MAN 2 : They 're fucking ... Hey ! Who the hell were they ? One , since when did other people know about Weevils ? Two , have they done this before and if so , how come we didn 't know about it ? Three , what do they want with them anyway ? Might not be connected , but we 've noticed a surge of unusual injuries being reported at the AE unit . Chunks taken out of legs and arms , deep wounds to backs and stomachs . So we have a wave of Weevil attacks to add to our problems . Oh , and by the way , that spray we used on them previously ? Looks like they 're becoming immune to it . - They 're mutating ? - Or evolving . So any sign of the one we lost earlier ? I 've run a trace on the van 's number plate . It 's fake . 2 , 500 vans of that type registered in the Cardiff area . Widen that to a 40 mile radius , and the number doubles . - So , run a trace on the vehicle ... - Route via traffic cameras ? This is Owen 's voice-mail . Leave a message if you must . Processing that now . Leave a message for Gwen and Rhys , and we 'll call you back . - If we remember . - Oi ! Hi , it 's me . I 've left three messages now . Look , I 've got dozens of excuses , um , hundreds , thousands ! But none of them good enough . Things have got away from me a bit lately . It 's this job . It never lets up . Look , I 'll see you later . I 'm not sure what time yet . I 've got some work to finish off first . Call me . Message deleted . Are you going to answer that ? Ninth missed call . Work . - Do you enjoy your job , then ? - Look , if you don 't mind , I came out to be alone . - Ah , the old Greta Garbo . - Something like that . Little bit of advice . Next time you feel like this , I think you should stay in . Trust me , the bigger the crowd , the more alone I feel . - I said no chatting up the punters . - Oh , for God 's sake . Tommy , I work in a bar . It 's my job to speak to them . You 're never happier than when you 're flashing your tits at a passing dickhead . - Don 't speak to her like that . - You what ? We were having a conversation . One day , when you 've grown up , you 'll realise that 's what human beings do . Tommy , stop it ! You 'll get me the sack ! See , it 's about using your opponent 's aggression to your own ends . Now , I 'd suggest you don 't pick fights with strangers . And you should really upgrade your boyfriend . What does a man have to do to get some peace in this city ? Owen 's still not answering his phone . Well , he 's been even more erratic than usual since that thing with Diane . Since the what ? It 's none of my business . What thing ? What thing , Tosh ? Owen and Diane . Before she took the plane , they had a thing . - You knew that , right ? - Oh , yeah , of course I knew that . I just didn 't know they had a " thing " thing . It started 10 minutes ago . What do you think it 's doing ? - I think it 's weeping . - Why ? Owen 's been studying this one . He thinks they have a low level of telepathic ability to share emotion across distance . You mean , it might be feeling the pain of another Weevil ? - I kind of hope we 're wrong , though . - Why ? Because that would mean somebody 's not only kidnapping Weevils , they 're causing them pain . What can you feel ? What do you know ? I 've tracked the van 's route . It went straight from the car park out to the docks . This was two hours ago . - What happened ? - The CCTV cameras went down . Do you think it was deliberate ? I think these guys really don 't like to be watched . See , and I know it 's a character flaw , but that makes me all the more determined to find out what it is they 're hiding . Looks like we missed them . Yeah , but if you quit places in a hurry , you tend to be forgetful . You know what they used these warehouses for during World War II ? Storing the bodies of dead Gls . Sometimes you can know too much history . Come on . There 's nothing here . So what were they doing here ? Why come all this way out ? - Psst . - What is it ? Looks human . Male . - Is he alive ? - Hello ? You okay there ? We 're looking for the people who were here last night . If you saw anything , now 's a good time to speak up . Jack , he 's bleeding . - Oh , my God . - Weevil marks . - You don 't think it 's still here , do you ? - No . We 'd hear it . Help me with the body . - Is that his ? - You don 't think I 'd choose that ring tone ? Don 't answer it . Hello . I don 't know who you are , but stay out of what doesn 't concern you . - Who killed this man ? - Did you hear what I just said ? I have this selective deafness when I 'm talking to cowards or murderers . Don 't interfere in things you don 't understand . Oh , I understand this better than you . 'Cause I know how this is going to end . We 're going to hunt you down . We 're going to ensure that you 're punished for what happened here . And we 're going to make you surrender that creature that you kidnapped . Is that clear enough ? Ianto , I need you to trace all calls to and from this number in the last 24 hours fast as you can . We 're on our way back . This is Owen 's voice-mail . Don 't leave a message . Nice try , Owen . I want you back at the Hub immediately . We 've got a Weevil murder , so get your bony little ass over here now . Dan Hodges . Date of birth , 21st January , 1979 . Salesman for web publishing software . Looks like he was married with a kid . Yeah , no shit , Sherlock . Right , definitely death by Weevil , but he took a right kicking before the throat was punctured . Weevils go for the kill , straight for the jugular . Look at his face . Black eye , bruises to the cheekbones . Same across the back and the ribs . Could he have been tortured ? Maybe , but I reckon these wounds were inflicted by humans . But why smack somebody about and then set the Weevil on them ? Why not get the Weevil to do all the work for you ? - Any joy with the phone records ? - The last incoming number was blocked , and the phone 's entire call history has been erased . God , they move fast . If you ask me , these guys are using Weevils to carry out the perfect murder . No fingerprints , no traces of recognizable DNA , a quick , guaranteed death . Nothing to connect anyone to the murder . Right . Should be a piece of piss to find the killer , then . What about this guy ? Someone 's got to break it to his wife that he 's dead . The shittiest part about being a police officer , and I can 't get away from it . Thanks for your kind words of support . What do you want me to say ? She 'll be all right in the end ? You can always count on Owen to make you feel better . Tosh mentioned you and Diane . - Did you ... - I didn 't want her to go . She went . Why are we still doing this , me and you ? Fine , let 's not . I was getting bored of your fuck-tricks anyway . You can be such a wanker sometimes , Owen , do you know that ? I do , as a matter of fact ! - Where the hell have you been ? - Walking . Well , in your absence , Toshiko 's had a great idea . - Well , it had to happen sooner or later . - Ignore him , Tosh . Yeah , just ignore me , Tosh . I can be such a wanker apparently . The van went from kidnapping the Weevil straight to the warehouse . They must 've known it was empty . So either they own it , or they had previous contact with the estate agents . Owen Harper , you 're going into property . Toshiko 's in the middle of fixing you a cover story . Hang on , why me ? Jack and Gwen were in the car park , I was in the warehouse . If they 've got access to CCTV , they 'll recognise us . We have to get under their guard , find out what 's going on . Yeah , all right . I could do with being someone else right now . - Mr Harper ? - Yeah . Mark Lynch . You 're looking to relocate your business to Cardiff . - Yeah . - And you export jellied eels . Really ? Huge growth market . China , South America ... I 'm having a nightmare trying to keep up with demand . - I 'll get you a batch if you find me the right gaff . - I think I 'll pass on that . - Any family to relocate ? - Just me . It 's better that way . And you 're looking for premises out by the docks . Hmm , nice big warehouse . That 's what I need . I 've got a couple that should be perfect . Hang on while I print . Thanks . Oh , we 're in . This 'll give us everything on his hard drive , including encrypted files . If I can establish a routing protocol , whatever he does on this computer from now on , we 'll know about it . Owen , you 're clear . These have got the square footage you 're looking for , good access , competitively priced . Except ... these all look like shitholes to me . Yeah , they are a bit . Didn 't I see your sign outside a big place in the Q section of the docks ? We 've accepted an offer on it . Pretty much signed and sealed . He 's lying . According to their records , it only went on the market last week . - Bummer . - What about a unit on an industrial estate ? Save a ton on rent , even after transport costs . And you just happen to have a list of suitable premises ? Nah . There are other possibilities . You free at the end of the day ? - Yeah . - Why don 't we go for a drink ? On your own in a strange city , see , I remember that feeling . Look at you now . Couple of gorgeous birds answering your phones for you . - If that 's not success , I don 't know what is . - It 's all bollocks , really . - But if you wanted me to put in a good word ... - No . Thanks . - Good to meet you , Mark . - Yeah , I 'll give you a bell . First , he 'll go for the web-link at the top of the page . Then he 'll want to know what other people say about the business . Now he 'll see what Owen has to say about himself . Welcome to the number one supplier of jellied eels to Britain and Northern Europe . With a client base of more than 150 resellers , we 're constantly looking to expand into new territories . If you 're interested in becoming an affiliate or Harper 's franchise holder , please contact our Sales Director on the number below . Harper 's sales , Jenny Long speaking . I 'm sorry , wrong number . Job done . I 've tracked down another set of suspicious injuries at the hospital . They sound pretty bad . Tosh , stay here and monitor Mark Lynch 's movements . - Ianto , with me . - I 'll come with you . - Go home . - But ... It 's not a request . Remember , don 't let it drift . - What you doing ? - You here now , are you ? That 's your pulling top . - No , it 's not . - It is ! That 's what you call it , since I said you looked sexy in it - You off out ? - Aye , Daf 's stag do . All day job . - Since when is Daf getting married ? - No , he 's not . But he thinks he 's missing out on a piss-up . So he 's having a Staying Single Stag . Few beers , see what transpires . Strip club , that sort of thing . - What time will you be back ? - Not sure . - But I 'm in tonight . - Well , I 'm not . I 've already made my statement to the police . According to your chart here , you nearly had your heart torn from your rib cage . Ooh ! A ten-hour operation to repair chest wounds . Why should I talk to you ? Let me tell you what did this to you . Six feet high , teeth like a shark , rippled skin and the rage of a wild animal . - Am I close ? - I was mugged . There was three of them , they had knives . So why were your wounds described by paramedics as bite marks ? Look , I can 't help it if they got mixed up . They 're overworked . There are lots of ways I can get you to talk , but the easiest would be if you consider the consequences should you not tell me the truth . And that is ... this creature will attack again , somebody will die , and it will be on your conscience . - Now tell us the truth . - I can 't . - They 'd kill me . - Who 'd kill you ? Everyone . What did he mean , everyone ? That 's all he 'd say . Couldn 't get any more out of him . That leaves us one option . Okay , Janet , time for a trip out . - You call it Janet ? - Barbara just never seemed right . You want to release a Weevil in the middle of Cardiff ! Not exactly in the middle , a little to the side . We placed a tracker in its boiler suit so when they capture it , we 'll know exactly where they are . It could kill any number of people before then . I 'm with Tosh . There 's no telling what might happen . We set it loose in the same place where they took the other one . It 's deserted this time of night . We 'll be with it every step of the way . - Tracker working ? - Yeah . Go , Janet ! Second right , 200 metres ahead . Shit ! Stop the car . She 's taken a left . Pedestrian access only ! Ianto , take over ! Now that 's what I call service . Cheers . Yeah , cheers . Shit . - We got a problem here , boys ? - Not with you . Come on then , let 's get it over with . No need for you to get involved ... Get up ! Thanks . Whoa , whoa . The Weevil has landed . - Got a signal ? - Yeah . Just so I know where we stand , we would never deliberately put a human being through that . - But Weevils are fair game , is that right ? - We need to follow them . This is your gaff ? Make yourself at home . I 'm in the wrong business . So , what 's your outlet ? Uh , for what ? - The anger . - Who said I was angry ? You 're not even living here yet and you 've got people coming after you . Yeah , well , some people need teaching a lesson . I 'm not criticizing . You 're not the only pissed-off bloke out there . It 's what the world does to us . - Fancy a beer ? - Yeah , why not ? You work yourself stupid , get a house , a car , plasma screen ... You end up with a workforce , people there specifically to look after your every whim . You 're officially successful , but what does it bring ? Nothing . Success has no worth other than itself . Seriously , I could live without all this . It doesn 't define me . Yeah , nice to have it though , yeah ? Ask yourself , what 's the point of your life ? Mark , mate , I only came here for a beer . There 's so much more , if you know where to look . Is that right ? It 's closer than you think . Something 's coming . Out there , in the darkness , something is coming . You drunk ? Two pints was all I could get down . They 've gone on without me . - Look , Gwen ... - I need to tell you something . What sort of thing ? I 've been sleeping ... I 've been having sex with someone else . From work . His name 's Owen . I mean , he 's a bit of a tosser actually , and it 's all gonna stop but ... - Shut up . - I 'm sorry . - I 'm really sorry . - You wouldn 't do that . But I have . - Then ... Why are you telling me ? - Because I 'm ashamed . And I 'm angry . And I want ... I need ... I need you to forgive me . And because I 've drugged you . - You 've done what ? - Just sit down . It 's nothing . It 's just an amnesia pill . Dash of sedative . You 'll wake up tomorrow , and you 'll forget everything . - Rhys ? - God , you selfish bitch ! I know , I just thought it would give us a chance ... A chance to get everything out in the open , you know , get everything out . Rhys ! Stay with me , Rhys . Say you forgive me . Say , " It 's all right , Gwen . " " Gwen , it 's all right . Gwen ... " Say it please , Rhys . Rhys , just say it once . Say it once , " I forgive you . " Rhys , please say it ! Say you forgive me . Say you forgive me . Say it ! Say it , please , say it . Say it , please . - Have you found the bathroom yet ? - Yeah . Cheers . Told you there was more to see . Mark , mate , I 'm really sorry . I couldn 't resist the padlock . - What do you think ? - What is it ? No idea . Don 't get too close , though . - Vicious bastard . - Where did you get it from ? I found one on the streets . It took five of us to bring it in . Other than that , I haven 't got a clue . Scientific experiment gone wrong ? Nuclear victim ? One of the lads even reckons it 's an alien . - Do you want to know what I think ? - Yeah , go on . I think it 's us , Owen , you and me , in 1000 years ' time . This is what we become when all we have left is our rage . - Not exactly a comforting thought . - Give it a smack . - You what ? - Punch it . - Why ? - That 's what it 's there for . - Or do you want me to do it for you ? - It just feels a bit weird , that 's all . All right , that 's enough ! It 's not exactly putting up a fight . We all need a punch bag . - So who are you , Owen ? - Sorry ? It 'd be pretty stupid not to assume you 're not connected to those two in the black SUV . I don 't know what you mean . Bloke in the big coat , cute little Asian girl ? I was watching . Nice website by the way . Kudos to whoever did that . Although , jellied eels ? I 'm not sure that was your greatest idea . - I wasn 't that bad . - Pretty much , you were . Whoever you are , you 've royally fucked up my plans . - Didn 't want all this getting out . - What about Dan Hodges ? What about his wife and kid ? I 'm not responsible for people 's life choices . Now , why did you lot take the body ? Why didn 't you go to the cops ? Because , Mark , they are parochial pigshits whose minds would implode if they saw this . Who are you , Owen Harper ? Is that who you are ? A little kid hiding behind a gun . If you want to know what happens , you 're not going to find out because of a weapon . Good boy , we 're finally getting somewhere . Now , you 're just you . Stripping things back to the core , Owen . Now we 're just two blokes . Equal . - Why did you murder Dan Hodges ? - I didn 't . All right , not technically . Did you do it here ? I mean , you let that thing loose on him . Perfect murder . Nothing to link you back to the crime . God , you haven 't got a clue , have you ? Dan wasn 't murdered . He was one of us . Tell me what happened . I can do better than that . Come on . Hello ? Anyone ? So where is it , Tosh ? - So what have we got now ? - Nothing . We have no clue where they are or what they 're doing . - So , what am I supposed to be looking at ? - Wait and see . All this lot with you ? - What 's going on ? - You 'll find out . I 've never been that keen on surprises . Jack , I 've ... Yes ! Jack , can you hear me ? What the hell are you doing there ? I told you to go home . There 's a text message that 's just come through on Dan Hodges ' phone . Charlie Foxtrot one zero , six Bravo Yankee . Seems to be a postcode for a building . It 's gonna have a Lynch Frost sign outside . - Okay , I 've got the location . - Gwen , we 'll pick you up on the way . So people get an alert by text message and they head to a property . A property Mark Lynch knows is empty . So the question is , what happens when they get there ? - What the hell 's going on here ? - Warm-up . - Warm-up ? Who are these blokes ? - Same as us . Ordinary blokes just trying to find meaning in a world that doesn 't have any . You don 't really believe that , do you ? We 're the dispossessed now , Owen . All the certainties our fathers had are gone . We 're a generation of no faith . In society , in religion , or in life . everyone into the big hall . All we can do is reduce ourselves to the basics . This is only the warm-up . Come on . You coming or staying ? Five , four , three , two , one . Come on , don 't just stand there , you muppet ! Get me out ! Nice one , mate ! Costs a grand to enter the cage . Whoever stays in there the longest across the night , takes home all the money . - You 're next . - Hang on . - These guys are paying to put their lives at risk ? - The ultimate extreme sport . Too much disposable income , not enough meaning . That 's us . So what about Dan Hodges , Mark ? He wouldn 't come out . Just stood in the middle of the cage and let it maul him . I think he got in there and he realised he didn 't want to live enough . He surrendered . - None of us could get to him in time . - And still you all come back . - Well , what else is there ? - This has to stop . More people are gonna die . Five , four , three , two , one . How long are we going to keep playing this game , Owen ? You lie , you bullshit , you sweet talk , but you are hiding , Owen . Get in the cage . - Not if you 're gonna point a gun at me . - Do you want me to shoot you ? Lower the gun and then I will get into the cage . Good boy . - What 's the longest anyone 's been in there ? - That 'd be Dan Hodges . When you get in there , when you 're up close with it , - take a look into its eyes . - Open the door ! It 's like looking into the darkest recesses of your own soul . Open the door . Come on , then . Owen ! Just open the door ! Jack ! Open it ! - Owen ... - Get off me ! - That 's enough ! - Help me , Jack . Help me get him out . - Owen , come on . Come one . - Get a stretcher ! - You did this to him . - He did it to himself . He had no fear . It 's over now . These creatures are to be left alone . Go back to your lives . Jack . - What are you doing ? - It 's over . You shouldn 't have . No , really , you shouldn 't . I hate grapes . Doctors reckon you can go home . Doctors ... what do they know , eh ? I didn 't want saving . You want us to apologise ? For a few seconds in that cage , I felt totally at peace . And then you blunder in . Do you always know best , Jack ? Is that what you believe ? I want you back in work tomorrow . - You sure you 'll be all right ? - Give us a moment alone , yeah ? Where 's the SUV ? Has it been stolen ? No , we have . They 're stuck in the middle of the Cardiff blitz . Toshiko ! It 's our duty to get them out . Open the rift now , and the whole world could suffer . Who knows what will come out ? I love you . It 's a trap to incite total chaos and destruction . - We don 't even know who he is . - He 's our leader . Not any more . I 'm Captain Jack Harkness , 133rd squadron .

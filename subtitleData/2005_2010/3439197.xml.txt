 Nothing is what it appears to be . It seems pretty clear to me . Because you 're only seeing part of it . I 'm talking about a clean slate . You ever try and clean an actual slate ? You always see what was on it before . Are you volunteering ... I don 't have a choice , do I ? How did it get this far ? Caroline , actions have consequences . Oh , God , you 're loving this , aren 't you ? I 'm sorry you don 't understand what I 'm offering here . But what we do helps people . If you become a part of that , it can help you . Right . You 're just looking out for me . Perhaps better than you have . We can take care of this mess . After your five-year term , you will be free to ... I don 't deserve this . I was just trying to make a difference , trying to ... take my place in the world , you know , like she always said , and now I 'm ... I know . I know . Actions have consequences . What if they didn 't ? Happy birthday , man . No way . No way . You cheated . How did I cheat ? You did something that will prove to have been cheating . This isn 't over . Oh , my God , you are a sore loser . Oh , I wouldn 't know ... I 've never lost . That 's okay , the first time , you 're always just a little bit sore . Oh , wow , that 's funny , coming from a cheater who is also a little bitch . You sure you didn 't let me win ? Two out of three . Nah . Huh ? Let 's just dance . You having a good time ? The best . Listen , uh , I know at the beginning of the weekend , we said no strings . We also said no ropes , and look how long that lasted . Yeah , I remember . I remember it all . I always will . What , like I 'd forget ? You think this is a normal weekend for me ? Maybe ? I had no idea you were a moron . Look , it 's ... it 's little , it 's stupid , but ... I want you to have it . You 're an amazing guy , Matt . When you say it , I almost believe . Thank you . For everything . It 's getting late . You 're not getting out of another dance . Of course not . I 'm just gonna go grab a drink . Okay . You ready for your treatment ? I think it 's time . Did you have a nice time ? I met a guy . Dude , where 's your friend ? It 's time for her to go . Had to get to her carriage before it turned into a pumpkin . What ? Stroke of midnight . Midnight ? The end of the ball . Dude , it ... it 's like 5 : 00 . Hey , you think you could take me back to the party after my treatment ? I 'll wait right here . You 're good people . Right . Maybe I shouldn 't go back . The last thing I want to be is clingy , but you know when you just ... you meet someone and ... you know ? If I 'm wrong , I 'll know . I mean , Matt can 't lie to save his life . If he gives me that look , I 'll walk away . But I don 't know , I think ... he feels it , too . I think I found something real . I 'm glad . This is gonna pinch a bit . You have a nice time ? I met a guy . I want you to have it . You ready to be a sad second place , man ? No obligations . Really ? No pressure . It 's just an experiment . How much fun can we have in three days ? Hello , Echo . How are you feeling ? Did I fall asleep ? For a little while . Shall I go now ? If you like . Everything go all right with the wipe ? Why don 't you just ask Echo ? Oh , that 's right . Because she can 't remember . Of course , it went all right . Imprint 's gone . The new moon has made her a virgin again . Is there some reason it shouldn 't have ? Something happen during the engagement ? I think she finally met the right guy . You 're so jaded , and at such a middle age . She had fun , right ? She thought so . There 's nothing good or bad , but thinking makes it so , man friend . We gave two people a perfect weekend together . We 're great humanitarians . Who would spend their lives in jail if anyone ever found this place . We 're also misunderstood ... which great humanitarians often are . Look at Echo . Not a care in the world . She 's living the dream . Whose dream ? Who 's next ? I don 't understand . You don 't have to understand . You just have to do as I tell you . They 'll find out , you know . And why should I care about that ? They 'll laugh at me . Everybody watches it . It 's all they talk about . That 's ' cause their brains are melting , and that reality crap is the reason why . I finished my homework . Well , if you finished your homework , you should get a present . How about ... Knowledge . I hate you . You have that right . Why are we stopping ? You know I could watch it , and you 'd never know . Yeah , well , I 'd see it all over your face even when you were sleeping . Some kind of roadblock . I got to go . And I 'll know . Tyrant . She 's completely helpless . I mean , she 's 12 years old , just a kid . How much are they demanding ? Five million . And you 'll pay it . Thanks . In Mexico , kidnapping is a thriving business , which is part of why we live here when my factories are there . But if you pay , there 's a better chance ... Have you contacted the police ? I was instructed not to . They 're useless , anyway . I need this to go smoothly . I need Davina to be okay . Mr. Crestejo , you 're a valued client . We will of course provide what you need . But there is a risk factor involved . I don 't want Rambo . I want a negotiator . This goes like clockwork , you understand ? That 's who I need . Clockwork . Well , our Actives are not robots , but I think we can make this work for you . Mr. Dominic will discuss the security details with you , and you can enter the rest into the confessional . Please remember , the Active won 't know they came from here . Any discussion of this place will only confuse them , and possibly send them right back . I know how important it is that not happen . Yes . Thank you . I 'm terribly sorry for all this . We will help . Ow ! Yeah , this feels very tight . I think you fell on it with something heavy . I don 't remember . Well , it 's gonna be fine . And your blood work and internals are all shipshape . I 'll just ask one of the staff to work on that knee . Would you like a massage ? They 're relaxing . Yes . I 'll set that up . I don 't remember what fell on me . Does that bother you ? Should it ? We 'll look after you . Does someone look after you ? Why don 't you wait in the massage area , and I 'll call for someone to work on that knee . She 's not asleep . Oh . What ... ? Just keep mapping the tissue . Hey , Echo . What are you doing here ? She hurts . She does . That 's because it 's her first time , and , uh , we have to do more extensive work on her . Work ? We 're making her better . In a little while , she 'll be strong and happy , and she 'll forget all about this and you ... will have a new friend living with you . Her name is Sierra . Sierra . Mm-hmm . Aren 't you supposed to be getting your physical with Dr. Saunders far from here right now ? We 're ready for your massage , Echo . Something fell on me . I bet it was something great . Agent Ballard , you were assigned to case designate Dollhouse over 14 months ago . How would you describe your progress to date ? Slow . I 'm actually very impressed by what I see here . You 've physically threatened a senator , disrupted a seven-year human trafficking investigation , been arrested for trespassing on Prince Amoudi 's yacht . The only legal action you 've successfully followed through on is your divorce . Paul , let me ask you . After all this , do you think the Dollhouse really exists ? I know it does . You 've seen it then ? You could , like , take us on a tour ? Look , we all know this assignment is a joke . If it 's a joke , then pull me off it . Except you can 't , because someone bigger than you thinks it isn 't a joke . I 'm a billionaire . I can hire anybody for anything . And I 'm gonna go to an illegal organization and have them build me , program me , what , the perfect date ? Confessor , assassin , dominatrix , omelet chef ? I 'm paying a million dollars for that ? I can get that . I have everything I want . Nobody has everything they want . It 's a survival pattern . You get what you want , you want something else . If you have everything , you want something else . Something more extreme , something more specific . Something perfect . Put it like that , it doesn 't sound so bad . The only way to imprint a human being with a new personality ... Which we 've yet to prove possible . ... is to remove their own . Completely . We 're talking about people walking around who may as well have been murdered . Which to me sounds pretty bad . Is that why you interfered with the Russians ? The Borodin case ? They 're the top of the heap in human trafficking . If people are disappearing ... That is an ongoing investigation ! All right ? We have a chance to dry up a major pipeline of girls being smuggled into this country , and you do not jeopardize that for a fairy tale ! You will stay out of everyone 's way , and you will stop pissing off powerful public figures without any evidence ! You 've been out of line , Paul . You have to back off . You need to keep away from the Borodin case . Do you understand ? Are you able to back off ? That won 't be a problem ... sir . Hello , Echo . Would you sit down , please ? The situation is a kidnap and ransom , 12 year-old girl named Davina Crestejo . The girl 's supposed to be exchanged for $ 5 million , which her father is willing to pay . And we are going to help him do that . Kidnapper 's Latino , probably Mexican , refers to himself as " Mr. Sunshine . " This is a high risk engagement so you 'll have both eyes and ears this time . Audio off a wire , and we 'll tap you into his security vid on the house and grounds . Anything goes wrong , or feels wrong , you extract Echo immediately . Her purpose is to facilitate the exchange , nothing more . No one is to be brought to justice . We 'll skip any ex-cop heroics , if you don 't mind . Not a problem . My only priority ... Is Echo . Good . So , who does she think she is ? Gabriel Crestejo ? I 'm sorry , who are you ? You asked for me . I 'm here to help . Our mutual friend referred me . I 'm sure he did . I 'm a little surprised , though , that he sent you . I 'm good with people . I put them at their ease . In my experience , a beautiful woman never puts anyone at their ease . Fatherly types do that . They 're warm and comforting , make people feel safe . A beautiful woman distracts people , makes them nervous , or jealous . I can 't afford that . Not with what 's at stake here . I think our friend sent the wrong person . Fatherly types . Like Edward James Almos . I hope there 's no offense . None taken , and I 'm not leaving . You can hire someone else , give them my fee , but I 'm the one best qualified to save your daughter . I 've been doing this my whole life . Just this . You want people to feel comforted ? We 're past that . These men are stone professionals . They took her from your house . Not on the way home from school , or in the park ... they came inside your house , your seriously fortified house , in order to tell you that they could . I 've dealt with the others ... amateurs , men with a grudge , or an urge . You want a professional , a man who knows the business . Knows how high the stakes should or shouldn 't go . The percentage of successful negotiations goes way up . And what 's the percentage ? Not a hundred . Is her room in here ? I 'll show you . We haven 't touched anything . Glasses , Topher ? She 's nearsighted . Is that supposed to make people take her seriously ? Like the librarian thing is gonna hide the fact that she 's ... Am I speaking Urdu ? She 's nearsighted , Boyd . You can mess up her eyesight ? I can mess up the neural connections to her eyesight . Make her brain process the information it gets any way I want . As , for example , blurry . But why would you ? Why handicap her in a job like this ? You see someone running incredibly fast , the first thing you gotta ask is , are they running to something , or are they running from something ? And the answer is always both . So these personality imprints ... they come from scans of real people . Now , I can create amalgams of those personalities , pieces from here or there , but it 's not a greatest hits ; it 's a whole person . Achievement is balanced by fault , by ... a lack . Can 't have one without the other . Everyone who excels is overcompensating . Running from something . Hiding from something . The past ? Sometimes . So what 's in the past that you gave Echo ? That 's her business , Boyd . She 's right for the job . She 's spent her life profiling and negotiating with kidnappers . That 's the person they needed , so that 's who Echo is . The expert . Who 's nearsighted . She also has asthma . What took you so long ? Is this Mr. Sunshine ? Where is Gabriel ? He 's right here . My name is Eleanor Penn . And I 'll be handling the transaction . I told him no cops ! Put Gabriel on , I 'm gonna cut his little girl so he can hear . He can hear . I am not a cop . I 'm not FBI . And I have no interest in justice . I 'm here only to facilitate a private transaction and make sure no one is hurt during it . No , you 're a federale ... you think I 'm stupid ? I think you knew Gabriel wouldn 't call the authorities if you took Davina . Which was not stupid . But Gabriel can 't do this alone . He 's afraid , and angry , and he knows those emotions are of no use right now . So you 'll deal with me . And everybody will get what they want . You may call me Miss Penn . I may ? I call you Miss ? I think I call you Ellie , since we 're becoming such good friends . I will not answer to Ellie . You may call me Miss Penn . Oh , so you 're the schoolteacher now , huh ? What , you gonna rap my knuckles if I 'm bad ? It 's unlikely . You telling me how it 's gonna be ? ! Al diablo contigo y to nombre ! I have the girl , okay ? I make all the rules . You want $ 5 million ? That 's right . Let 's make it eight . What ? 8 million . That 's two million apiece . Call back in 40 minutes and let Davina talk to her father . There 's no way you 're just gonna give me an extra three mil ... You have the money . It would have been polite to ask . They have to get used to doing it my way . Right now , they 're getting very used to it . Or they think she 's messing with them . I am . But you 'll give them the money . You have to get used to doing things my way , too . The last time a family 's head of security let their daughter get kidnapped , she was recovered in three days . His body never was . Speak out of turn again and I will scold you . How 'd you know there was four of them ? You said , " 2 million apiece . " Guy didn 't blink . You heard him not blink ? Four 's the median number in these cases . Three guys with ambition , one with information . What more can you tell me about them ? I 'll tell you when it 's useful for you to know it . They better put her on . They will . In 38 minutes . You 're the boss , Ellie . Miss Penn . What , you don 't believe me ? This immigration guy , he 's patting me down , he 's feeling me up , he 's starting to get very personal , right ? I tell him he should buy me a drink , tell me I 'm pretty , he wants to grope me like that . Oh , you 're a talker , new guy . It 's Lubov . Uh , Velnik asked me to come , give Mr. Borodin my respects . I like a talker . Immigration , he doesn 't even crack a smile . Then out comes the rubber glove . I 'm serious . Loomis , I got a name for you . Hello . You got $ 8 million for us ? That 's right . If it 's that easy , I think we gonna make it an even ten . What-What are you doing ? You hang up on me again , I chop her up right now ! And I 'll use her for bait ! Is Davina ready to talk to her father ? You got one minute . Papi ? I 'm scared . Mija ... Mija , I 'm right here . Papi , I 'm sorry . No , no , no , mija , it 's not like that . You just do as the men say , I 'm gonna bring you home . It 's okay , it 's gonna be okay . I 'm scared . All they want is money . They yell at me . Except the one with the mask , he doesn 't talk . It 's dark in the room , but I can hear the ... Davina , I 'm a friend of your father 's . I need to know if they 're hutting you . Not much . Did they feed you ? But they push me around . A little . And they wouldn 't let me use the bathroom at first , but then they did . It 's the small kind ... Your father wants to tell you something . I , uh ... I , uh , I want you to be strong , Davina . Remember that I love you and I will never let anything happen to you . I love you , Papi . Please put the man back on . The money tomorrow . I call you at noon to tell you where . Maybe . And she 'll be there . There are only two ways for this to go ... either everybody gets what they want , or nobody does . We will not pay if she 's not there . You told me you 're good with people . I misspoke . I 'm good at people . She was trying to tell me something ! And I needed her not to . Suppose they figured out what she was telling you before you did ? Do you think this would endear her to them ? But if we could find her before they do something ... And what , rush in with tear gas ? These people don 't handle surprises well . They get their money or they dig a hole . You have to trust that I have done this many , many times . I have to trust that ... right . Yesterday , you weren 't a nurse or a clown in the circus . What ? You 're the best , the best one they could send . Why is that ? What makes you so good at this ? I don 't have any hobbies . No , no , no . You have to do better than that . You have to make me believe , believe like you believe . Who are you ? You want my résumé ? I studied psychology , forensic science , profiling from former instructors at Quantico . Been licensed seven years . Handled over 12 negotiations . Why , why , why ? What made you do all those amazing things ? Did something terrible happen in your childhood ? Did horrible men come and snatch you away ? Yes . You were kidnapped . When I was nine . How long did that ... Three months . And they did things to you . Unprofessional things . Is this helping you in some way ? You don 't remember ? Maybe it 's all made up . There was one . He got rid of the others after they were paid and ... All the terrible memories these men put in your head . Why would they do that ? Sometimes the bad things just happen and no one can protect you from them . I 'm okay . I 'm fine , I 'm okay . I 'm sorry . Forget it . I 'd like to get some sleep . We 've got a long day tomorrow . I 'll have Maria make you up a bed . Don 't move . Hey , make sure the ladies at my table have what they need , huh ? The champagne never stops flowing . The good stuff . For the first few bottles , the good stuff . After that , the house is fine . You 're about to make a very bad mistake . Dollhouse . What ? Dollhouse . Say it . Dollhouse . Say it again . Your brains are ... Okay , dollhouse . Doll freaking house . I 'll keep saying it ... it 's fun to say . Dollhouse , dollhouse , dollhouse , dollhouse . You see the Borodins , you say it some more . You think you want to mess with the Borodins ? No , but they supply girls , some of them very high-end , to fine , upstanding clients . There 's one client I 'm interested in . Find out who 's connected to the Dollhouse , the Borodins won 't be touched , and you 'll never see me again . I haven 't seen you yet . You will . Wash your hands . And your shoes . You look better than on the phone , chica . It 's still Miss Penn . Me disculpo . The money . Please . This is not your first time . Let 's go . Come on , let 's go , let 's go . Davina ! Davina , mi hija , it 's okay . Papi 's here . Okay ... now you show . We take that on the boat . Your daughter steps off . You don 't move towards her until we are away . Whoa ... whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa whoa . Hey , Boyd , what 's going on ? We 're good so far . No , no , Echo 's not good . Something 's not good , and Echo knows it . This is maybe your first time . It 's just a condition ... we 're not making trouble . Are you trying to blow this ? Don 't let them on the boat . You said that 's the way it is . They 're not gonna give her back . He 's not gonna give her back . No , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . She gets off first . Get the hell back . You give me my daughter ! We need an ambulance . The client is shot . Extract the Active . Do it now . Is it bigger than your thumb ? Echo . Is it ... is it bigger than your thumb ? Miss Penn , look at me . You can 't fight a ghost . You ready for your treatment ? You can 't fight a ghost . It 's so dark . Of course it 's dark . It 's better . You don 't see , you don 't make a sound . You forget his face . Whose face ? He 's all thumbs . What happened on the dock ? What went wrong ? He doesn 't give them back . Who , the man in the mask ? He 's old now . He 's the same age . I am proportionately similar to a girl , a small girl . The older man . You know him . He 's the one that took you . They never found him . He said he was a ghost . You can 't fight a ghost ... but he was heavy , the weight of him . Ghosts aren 't heavy . Ghosts are sheets with holes cut out . He took you away . And now ... It 's unprofessional . He 's taken Davina . She 's proportionately similar to a girl . He won 't touch her until he 's taken care of the others . The other two men ? They 'll be dividing the money and make sure there 's no tracers , no dye pack . They 'll get excited . They won 't see him coming . Six hours . Before he kills them ? And takes her away . On the boat ? It 's been seen . They were planning to beach it anyway . It 's a Houlberd , 30-footer . It 's got a decent range . And it was riding high . They haven 't bothered to fuel it ... good . Let 's place them anywhere from here ... to here . Still a lot of choices . I 'm missing something . The man an the phone ... what did he say ? The mask . Only one man wore a mask . Because she knows him . He doesn 't just have information . He 's in her life . We find him , we find the ghost . How does she know him ? Something the other one said . We need to do my treatment now , and we need to do it fast . Miss Penn ... Come on , Langton . A client 's in critical , weapon 's discharged . You think I 'm gonna let you hold her hand while Topher scrubs her ? Two minutes . You have any idea of the crap that 's raining down on us ? Handler intervention triggers an immediate debriefing - to make sure that we weren 't exposed . - We 're close . As soon as I finish my treatment , we 'll find her . He won 't do this again . I need to talk to DeWitt . You need to tell me everything that went down today . It wasn 't a glitch . The imprint was rock solid . There was a weird spike last night , but what happened at the dock happened to Eleanor Penn . Or the people we made her out of . I need you to do this quickly . I live to serve . Barging in here isn 't going to help your situation , Mr. Langton . Echo can find the Crestejo girl . I 'm sorry . He 's faster than you 'd think . You cannot wipe her right now . I can do any damn thing I see fit . Echo botched the engagement . She jeopardized this entire operation . of an abused girl , and you put her face to face with her abuser . She recognized one of her kidnappers . And she can find him again . She 's the only one who can . Ma 'am , we need to distance ourselves from this . We don 't know if the client 's going to live . This is becoming news . I 'm sorry , Mr. Langton , but this is complicated . No , it isn 't . Echo 's in pain , but she 's the right girl for the job , and she knows the territory . She can find Davina before that man lays a finger on her . You wipe her , you 've lost all of that . We do not have a client ! We have a mission ! We prefer to call them engagements . You have not been here as long as some of the others , so I will overlook the error . I 've been here long enough to know that you like to tell yourself what we do helps people . Let Echo help this girl . Where are my glasses ? I know how to find her . It was the first call . The kidnapper said , " You 're the schoolteacher now . " He stressed you 're , like there 's already a teacher in the mix . The one in the mask . Check her school . See who 's missing . He 's been close to her . He 's probably not Latino . Ms. Penn , I 'm Lawrence Dominic . Security contractor . Yes , ma 'am . I have a chopper standing by . I 'll need a radio contact while we 're en route . That 'll be Mr. Langton . He 's staying here . She needs backup . Not from you . I 'm her handler . Miss DeWitt will decide what you are . James Shepherd , Caucasian male , 33 . Out sick 12 consecutive days . Has a sister with an isolated house six miles from the dock . I 'm going to need a clean and quiet touchdown with zero chance they 'll see or heaeaour approach . With respect , the last time you went head to head with these people , you folded . My man 's fully ... Your man gives me ten minutes , or Davina will die . How is she ? See the blue areas ? That 's fear . It all looks blue . That 's where I 'm going with this . Uh , the persona we developed ? Bunch of different people . Yeah . And one of them was abused by the guy she ran into . I know . Yeah , I looked her up . She killed herself . Last year . She never got away from him . What are we playing at ? It 's the woman . What ? From the drop ? Damn it ! Who else ? You see anyone else ? I 'm alone . Please open the door . Don 't do it , man . Listen to me . Who knows where we are ? Everyone 's going to know very soon , Mr. Shepherd . You left a wide trail , but that 's not your problem . He is . Hell you on about ? Soon as that money 's counted , he 's going to kill both of you . You think we fall for that crap ? Turn us on each other ? You tell us how long till they come , you talk . Or I find something to stuff that mouth up . I think I 'm a little old for you . The man that shot Mr. Crestejo is dead . You will be identified as the ringleader . You two haven 't killed anyone . You can let me leave with Davina , and get out of the country very rich men . The girl 's not here . She 's in the fridge . You unplugged it and pulled out the shelves . You had to rope it shut , of course , 'cause these days , they don 't lock . We were gonna tell people where she was . You were gonna die . 'Cause there 's something this man wants even more than eight million dollars . Shut your mouth ! Hey ! Lady seems to know a lot . I know everything . All the girls he kept , till he was through with them . Till he got bored , or just broke them down . I even know about the one he dumped in the river before he was sure she was dead . It 's over . You can 't hurt me anymore . You can 't fight a ghost . We 're going now . We 'll be okay . Here . Go now . I told you to wait . There were shots . We made a call . We were coming out . Is she injured ? Are you hurt ? Then get over it . The money 's here . I want it bagged , and our presence swept in three minutes . You 're okay . You 're okay , okay ? You 're free . You 're free . It 's a solid win , ma 'am . The client 's stabilized . We have the payment , plus the eight million . And both Actives performed admirably . It nearly came crashing down on us . It was contained . Yeah . Yes . Now tell me how we 're going to contain this . Oh , no , no , no , no , no , get that thing out of my face . It 's for the video yearbook . Say hi to your mom . Okay . Hi , Mom ! Are we done ? Is there someone you 'd like to say good-bye to ? Ditra and Meg , life without you will be meaningless and bleak , my dormies . Oh , and the girls of Sigma Tau , sisters forever . Let 's hope those venereal diseases make you all sterile , you snobby-ass pack of hos . Oh , that 's definitely going in . So , what are you planning on doing after graduation ? Yeah , I probably should have thought about that . I 'd like to take my place in the world , like Mrs. Dundee taught us . Global Recovery , Doctors Without Borders . The world is in need of some serious saving . And I want to travel . Travel around the world as I save it . In a private jet that I pilot and design . Okay , go ahead and laugh , yearbook monkey . I know : I 'm such a cliche . What can I say ? I want to do everything . Is that too much to ask ?

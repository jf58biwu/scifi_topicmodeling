 My name is detective Brett Hopper , and this is the day that changes everything ... Put your hands up ! You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder ... Who the hell are you people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I am living the same day ... over and over again . The day is the same but different things happen . - Every day , I get another chance . - For every decision , there 's a consequence . Garza sent evidence to my sister Jennifer and me before he died . I think whoever killed this girl killed Garza . My partner Andrea helped me figure out the clues . That thing you asked about matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez . He 's serving five consecutive life sentences . My informant Damien may know something that can help me , but Rita 's ex-husband , Chad had the most important information of all . Where is it ? The murder book , you have it . - No , I don 't . - You 're lying . If you 're right , the book 's on the front seat of my car . Now that I have the murder book , I have to find out who the girl in the picture is . That thing you asked about matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez . He 's been in Pelican Bay since ' 89 , so no way he could have killed anyone . Keep that lyin 'bitch in the trunk . I 'll be there . They got Baxter , but they can 't find Hop . I meet a chick like that , she 'll be cooking for me in three days . Whoo ! No , we agreed this be done a certain way , and now you 're changing the plans on me . No ... no , I 'm not angry . I just feel like I keep telling you the same thing over and over . Bye , mom . What are you doing here ? - That was nice . - That was more than nice . It 's been a while . A while ? What was last night ? No , I 'm just saying ... I guess ... I guess I just can 't get enough of you . Oh , no . Where do you think you 're going ? I gotta go to the station , pick up this murder book from this cop before he leaves for the day . You 're in narcotics . Why do you need a murder book ? This cold case that my pops was working on back in the day may be connected to something I 'm working on right now . Your dad ? That 's kind of weird , huh ? You and your dad connected through a murder . There have been stranger things . What time you supposed to go meet this cop ? I 'm not . I 'm just gonna break into his car and take it . Yeah , right . I hope they bust you . How you holding up ? Eddie wasn 't real happy about rehab , but ... we talked about it . He knows he needs the help . - That 's good . - Here 's the thing you called about . Miguel Dominguez . Gang task force didn 't have much . This is way too thin for a guy with five consecutive life sentences . Yeah , I know . It didn 't seem right to me , either , but I checked . That 's it . Hold up . He 's a latin disciple ? It didn 't come up anywhere I checked . It 's the first tag G.T.F. puts in the system . Anybody ask you why you wanted this ? No ... but you got me curious . Is this connected to the L.D. thing you 're working with the feds ? Yeah , I think so . And you were gonna tell me about that one day ? All right , you wanna roll with me on this , you find out why there 's only two pages on this guy . I have I.A. In an hour . - God forbid I keep Shelton waiting . - Well ... he 'll live . Any leads on the disciples yet ? I 'm about to go chase one down . Thanks for this . Where are you going ? Where is he ? - I don 't know . - Huh ? - I don 't know . I swear , man . - Where 's Damien ? You gotta be kidding . We 've got a problem . Hey , ese , you ain 't got no business here . Turn around and keep walking . My business is with Damien . Move . - You 're making a big mistake ... - Move . It 's not what you think ! Go ! You have no right to be here , Hop . - This is my family . - I called . - You didn 't pick up . - You know what this looks like , huh ? The lack of respect ? You coming up in here with a gun ? My moms is here . What the hell is wrong with you ? I thought you had more sense than this . You 're on the run , D. There are skinheads out there looking for you ... You think I 'm running , huh ? I got people looking for me everyday , Hop . I ain 't hiding 'from nobody . And being here is important , all right ? I promised my niece I 'd make it to her party , and I keep my promises . Something you need to work on . You lucky I 'm here with my family , Hop , or I 'd deal with you myself . - We need to talk . - Get up out of here , Hop before I change my mind about letting you leave . Two minutes , outside . I 'm gonna be right back , all right , loco ? Let me handle this hura . Better make it quick , Hop . I may be your boy , D. , But I 'm not one of your boys . We straight on that ? - Oh , I 'm gonna remember this . - Shut up and listen . Miguel Dominguez ... he 's a latin disciple connected to a murder I 'm looking into . You want me to help you ? Hop , you don 't get that kind of love , all right ? Everything that 's happening to you right now , D. : the skinheads , the hit on the safe house ... all goes back to this guy , to this case . What 's that ? It 's a murder book . Any info on a murder goes right in here . So this is how you catch bad guys , huh ? Some of 'em . - Who 's this ? - She 's a Jane Doe . Looks more like a juanita to me . Look here . Now this hourglass was found next to her dead body . L.D. prints were all over it . - So go catch 'em , Shaft . - Already been caught . Dominguez has been doing life , Pelican Bay , since ' 89 . Problem is , she was killed in ' 91 . Well , he 's definitely fam . Old school as hell , but he ain 't ringing no bells . What 'd he do ? Killed his parents in their sleep . Arrest report said the cops found him in the kitchen , - eating on a bowl of cereal , still ... - had all the blood all over him . So then you do know him ? Not as no damn Dominguez , bro . Well , as who ? Es el Llorón . " The Crying Man " . We don 't talk about him , Hop , - ever . - Well , you about to talk right now . He 's the bogeyman . Someone goes missing , must be el Llorón . Kid don 't eat his vegetables , you tell him , el Llorón is coming , and he cleans his plate . El llorón ... he 's like freddy , kill you in your dreams . - This is where she was found ? - You know it ? L.D. Territory ? - Nah , man . - Come on . Don 't waste my time , D. Look , Hop . I got nothing more to say about el Llorón . But I might be able to help you with her . Hop . El madre Magdalena ... está el detective Hopper . ¿ Y por qué busca esa muchacha ? She wants to know why you 're looking for her . Tell her I need to know who she is ... and why she died . Sólamente quiero saber quien era la muchacha , y porque se murió . Venga conmigo . The sister 's been looking after immigrants and illegals since I was growing up . Somebody goes missing , the families come to her . They 're all missing ? Yeah . I knew her . She used to live down the street from me when I was growing up . Not that many . We should be out of here in no time , right ? All right , where do you wanna start ? - Just start at the beginning . - I already told you , - Brett was with me all night . - Ms. Shelton , if we could just go through the night one more time . He didn 't do this . He got to my house around 9 : 00 . He stopped and got chinese , we watched a movie and we went to bed around 11 : 30 . Did you fall asleep together ? I woke up to use the restroom around 2 : 30 . He was still asleep . He was with me all night . Will you excuse me ? - She seems pretty credible . - Why , because she 's cute ? How about because she hasn 't flinched from anything we 've asked ? - I believe her . - If she 's telling the truth , someone 's lying . - Tell him what you told me . - You ! About to get outta here ! Man , this toy cop over here said I had some dime bags on me . Now I did have 'em , but y 'all need to let me back out on the streets , 'cause you know I 'm on the same team . - Team ? - Yeah , I been puttin 'in work for Hopper , man . I 'm one of his C.I. ' s . This is what you brought me here for ? Matter of fact , I saw my man this morning . You saw Hopper today ? Yeah . - Let 's talk some more . Come on . - What ? Oh , come on , man . I been up here all day . Yo , Hop , this is way too much work . Why don 't you just tell me about el Llorón ? We don 't have to mess with all this . We 're in the basement of a church . Nobody can hear you . What , you don 't think the devil ever goes to church ? ¿ Por qué un hombre al que buscan por asesino le importa tanto encontrar un alma perdida ? She said , " why does a man who 's wanted for murder care so much for a lost soul ? " La policía lo ha estado buscando . Cops been rolling through the hood looking for you , hop . Tell her I was framed . This girl can lead me to the truth . El dice que le culparon y esta muchacha puede llevarlo a la verdad . Entonces , no es el alma de ella lo que está buscando . - Cause ... - Yeah , I know , I got it . She still needs to be found . Ahora tienen que irse . Gracias . We need to see if this girl 's mother still lives around here . You know what ? Here on out , you need to do this on your own , Hop . If this is all connected to el Llorón , I ain 't tryin 'to be involved on that level . You already are , Damien . Rita , is everything okay ? Brett , where are you ? - What 's wrong ? - These two detectives came and pulled me off my job . They grilled me . - Wait , Chad didn 't come get you ? - Chad ? I haven 't talked to Chad in weeks . Brett , they 're saying you killed a man . I know , I know , and I didn 't do it . I 'll explain all that later . Listen , for now , stay in the house , no matter what . All right , I 'm gonna call you right back . You 've reached Chad Shelton . Leave a message . Yeah , man , where are you ? No , we agreed this would be done a certain way , and now you 're changing the plans on me . No ... no , I 'm not angry . I just feel like I keep telling you the same thing over and over . Bye , mom . What are you doing here ? - This is my family . - Two minutes . Got it . Here it is . Thank you , sister . All right , let 's go . - Excuse me . - I told you , he 'll see you when he 's ready . Okay , you know what ? Tell him he can find me in Narcotics . Yeah , it 's me . Reschedule , Battle . He lost the book . How 's your next week looking ? Don 't stress , Hop . This side of town , you blend right in . Yeah , right , with this Bull 's-eye on my chest . Bull 's-eye ? That 's more like an " S. " Today you 're " supercop . " I still can 't figure how you found that picture so fast . Been looking for it for a while . I hate this part . I know what you mean . Yes ? Ma 'am , I 'm detective Hopper . Are you related to Isabella Contreras ? Yes , I 'm her mother . May we come in , please ? Thank you . Yes , ma 'am , we 've finally figured out what has happened to Isabella . I hate to say this to you , but ... your daughter Isabella has been killed , Mrs. Contreras . Con permiso , I ... I 've forgotten where the tea is . Mrs. Contreras ... See ? She was just here yesterday . Who ? Isabella ? Yes . She told me before she went to work that ... she would be back tomorrow . Tomorrow ? Oh , I 'm sorry , the tea . Damn , Hop . She thinks her daughter is still alive . You need to go through her things ? I 'm just saying , you need to show some more respect for the dead . I 'm trying to find her killer , Damien . What do you call that ? Hotel soaps and shampoos . Maybe she worked at a hotel , cleaned rooms , kept a few nice things . You ever heard of a hotel maid that could afford dinner at Morton 's ... or these ? She had a papi chulo . What , that means " sugar daddy " ? I 'm right with you . Mrs. Contreras , did Isabella work at a hotel ? No , a very expensive club . She tells me all the time how nice the people are ... very wealthy . You know the name of the club ? She said it all the time . Just come back tomorrow when she 's home . Then you can ask Isabella the name . Ma 'am , I can 't come back tomorrow . Isabella will be sorry she missed you . I wish I had Mr. Detweiler 's number . He 'd remember . - Detweiler ? - Yes . He got Isabella the job at the club . You really should come back tomorrow . Now we 've gotta find this guy Detweiler . I was cool helping you with sister Magdalena , but after that crazy-ass old lady , you can do this little " tenspeed and brown shoe " routine by yourself . In case you forgot , - I got my own drama . - Yeah . Sure , I 'll be there . He 's good . How the hell did they find us ? Punk-ass bitches blew up my ride . We gotta bounce . I don 't give a damn about that truck . Listen , anybody come near my family : mama , Rosa , anybody ... you burn them to hell . Take me back to my truck ? I got a better idea . Hey , I just saved your ass . - Tú eres una maldición . - What ? You 're bad luck . - Whatever . Just take me to my truck . - Your legs ain 't broke . Use 'em . Yo , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! Forgot my damn ... phone . Yeah ... Andrea , it 's me . Hopper , I heard something on the way over here . I know , I gotta tell you about that . You know about Chad ? He was gunned down at an A.T.M. On Olympic and Hope . - What ? - They think it was an armed robbery . Okay ... Damien was attacked , and Chad was ... - This has never happened before . - What are you talking about ? You gotta take me to Rita 's . Rita . I can 't stop crying . How 'd you find out ? They called me at the police station . He still had me as a contact . Well , he was your husband . I know Chad and I had our problems , but he was a decent man . He was good in his own way . He just ... he didn 't have to die like that , so senseless . After they told me , all I could keep thinking about was you being safe . - They said ... - I know , I know . It 's-it 's not true . Then you shouldn 't even be here if they 're looking for you . No , I wanted to make sure you were all right . You should go . If anything was to ever happen to you , Brett ... Baby ... I 'm not going anywhere . - Stop it . - I don 't believe you . Seriously , I gotta go . So you 're saying no to breakfast ? When do you eat ? I never see you eat . I eat . It 's just ... I know , cop stuff , - cop stuff , cop stuff . - Come on . So what do you have to do today ? Today I gotta find a guy named Detweiler . All right ? - Later . - Move . You 're going to admit to killing Alberto Garza . Why ? Tell me why this is happening ! I swear to God , I will find you . Can I help you ? Son of a bitch ! Why are you doing this ? That 's funny , when I asked you why , you shoved a needle in my neck . Conrad ... - Conrad ! - Margaret , call 9-1-1 . Yeah , Margaret , why don 't you do that ? What do you want ? You 're gonna tell me everything , and then you 're gonna give me one reason why I shouldn 't kill you . Well , there 's one . I 'm gonna count to three . One ... two ... Mr. Detweiler , I 'm detective Brett Hopper . How can I help you ? Just so we 're clear , I know who you are and what you 're capable of . I 'm sorry . I don 't follow . I also know that your wife Margaret is in the house with a shotgun . Don 't call for help . - Sure you don 't want some ? - I wanna know about Garza and the Contreras girl . I wanna know why the hell you 're doing this to me . Conrad . You didn 't say you had company . Margaret ... dear , this is detective Hopper . Hello , detective . Remember , Timmy 's birthday party is today at 4 : 00 . Address is on your desk . Pleasure to meet you . Does your family know what kind of a man you are , that you torture and kill people for a living ? My family is none of your business . You made my family your business . I 'm just playing along . Timmy ... he 's a good-looking kid . Looks just like his mother , Lila . I bet you can 't wait to go see them , along with your other daughter , Catherine . Yeah , they have a really nice place in Westwood . and when did you discover this ? Today . Well , sorry if I seem unimpressed , but you need to understand that I 've been doing this sort of thing since you were a little boy with a toy badge , chasing after your father 's shadow . What the hell do you know about my father ? You 're not that kind of man . You don 't know what kind of a man I am . Trust me when I say that I do , and you are nothing like the people that I work for . What people ? Who do you work for ? People who 'd do far worse than threaten my family . People who would do far worse than put a gun to my head , because that 's never been done before . You 're gonna take me to them . - No , I 'm not . - Then you 're gonna die . Hopper ... what you don 't realize is that I am prepared to do whatever it takes in order to protect my family . So ... go ahead . Pull the trigger . Can I help you ? Everything you want is inside : the murder book , the hourglass , the photo , all of it . Just ... - make it stop . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . You don 't have to come after me , my sister or Rita . All right ? It ends today , you understand ? You and the people you work for , - you win . - It 's not that simple . No ! Make it stop . He came to your house . I assume there must be a leak at the station . Maybe you should have asked Hopper how he found you before you let him go . Sorry , I felt letting him leave was the best way to handle the situation , especially after he left this . He had everything : - the hourglass , the missing film ... - He had the murder book . How did he get it ? I don 't know . What did he hope to accomplish ? All he said was : " Make it stop . " Beyond that , I have no idea what he knows . they 're not going to be happy you allowed Hopper to make contact with you . And how should I proceed ? If he took the murder book , he knows much more than he 's letting on . Burn it all down . The cop who lost the book ... He was gunned down at an A.T.M. The gang leader ... Hopper ... kill them all . And the girl ? I 'll take care of the girl . Damien , shut up and listen . The skinheads are still out there looking for you , all right ? They 're in a black van with a woman painted on the back . They 're trying to kill you . Andrea , listen to me . - I need you to do something . - Jen , are you all right ? - Yeah , Brett , what 's wrong ? - Where are you ? On my way to the mall . Is everything all right ? Yeah , I just wanted to make sure you 're okay . - I 'm fine . - Where 's Randall and the kids ? At the house . Jen , I need you to get home immediately . Tell Randall if he sees anything shady , to call the cops . - Brett ... - Jen , please , just do it . - Yeah . - We got the girl . Good . I 'm on my way . Nah , he 's around here somewhere . They don 't stray too far from where they live . Tell Fencik once we take care of this garbage , we 'll call . Hey ... heard you were looking for me . No , we agreed this would be done a certain way , and now you 're changing the plans on me . No ... no , I 'm not angry . I just feel like I keep telling you the same thing over and over . Bye , mom . What are you doing here ? Tell you the truth , I 'm not so sure . I thought something happened to you . I 'm okay ... those detectives , they said ... I know what they told you . I didn 't do it . Why ... why is this happening ? A lot of people could have been hurt today because of something I did ... something I took . I ... I don 't understand . The most important thing is that you 're okay . Where 's the girl ? You said you had her . This is not a night for mistakes . I agree , sir . So what 's the problem ? You let him come to your house . Finish it . You just remember , next time it could be you . People are always wondering what the difference is between a warning and an example . The difference is rather simple . Most people don 't heed warnings , but they learn from examples . This is an example ... how we bury our secrets . I understand .

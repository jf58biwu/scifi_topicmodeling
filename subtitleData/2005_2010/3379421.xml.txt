But fire that big , There 's always survivor stories . Like with the titanic . You know , there 's only one titanic survivor left , Millvina dean . Course , she was only two months old when it happened So her story isn 't particularly instructive . You 're a very happy person . I am ? I don 't know that many happy people .

Living it up on the red carpet . I enjoyed your film very much , mr. valentino . Thank you . Although I thought your decision To return the gun to lady diana To protect herself from the caravan of thieves Was misguided Given that she was a security risk . Stark is shaking hands with valentino . But look at his eye line . He 's looking at that man . " rupert chandler . " Check out that hat . We could search the city and county records For more on stark . Where are they ? Basement. vital records . But it 's locked and I don 't have the keys .

Are you trying to get me fired ? - No . - then what are you doin ' down here ? Looking for records on myron stark . I don 't think he was who everyone thinks he was . I let you in After hours whenever you want . And for you to go and do this , Exactly what I tell you not to , Really not cool . I need the information . And I need this job. you broke the lock . I 'll fix it . Just put it back. put it all back . Don 't . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have gone down there . Forget it. it 's no big deal . Yes , it is . We 're friends . I don 't really have many friends . Actually , I don 't have any friends . You ? that--that can 't be true . So did you find anything out down there ? No. there 's no record of myron stark before the fire . Dead end . I don 't like dead ends . He could 've been an immigrant . Came through ellis island , shortened his name . Worked his way up from nothing . It 's the immigrant spirit . Single-minded pursuit of a goal . Never giving up . Buying into the american dream . An effective strategy . Either that or he robbed banks . What ? Can you show me police records ? Shortly after 2 : 00 pm , A lone robber held up the la brea savings and loan . Witnesses say the masked man Armed with a thompson submachine gun And a daring disregard for human life opened fire . Eight citizens were felled And did not live to tell about it . This is the third bank robbed in this fashion in recent weeks . Detective , can you tell us how much was looted From the vault ? Over $ 70,000 in cash , silver , and liberty bonds . Was the robber injured in the fray ? Police let fly with a hail of bullets . The robber was hit with nearly 30 rounds , But escaped on foot . How in god 's name did he survive ? that has not been ascertained . A manhunt is underway . You really think he robbed banks ? It 's a very effective strategy . But why ? what did he need it for ? To buy into the american dream . Stark bought parcels of land in the san fernando valley , Burbank , sunland , van nuys Two days after the last heist . What 'd he do with all that land ? He built houses . I found this application For a business license . Construction . This is worldwide news . Myron stark versus rupert chandler . A classic david versus goliath . Real estate magnate and builder rupert chandler Was the undisputed king Of the expanding san fernando valley . But along came a young upstart , myron stark . What started as a one-man operation Soon grew into a thriving business That went head to head With the largest builder in the county . It 's said stark spoke six languages , Paid double the wages of his competitors , And treated all of his workers equally Regardless of their employment history or citizen status . Stark himself could always be found shoulder to shoulder With his workers , A pickaxe in his strong hands . Soon stark company became a thorn In the side of his rival . His meteoric rise Threatened to topple the " king chandler " From his throne . Chandler 's top foreman , fred jeffers , Was recently asked about the rivalry . To hear jeffers tell it , " we 're not worried . " fly-by-nights like stark come and go . " chandler 's an established company with contracts " booked through 1925 . We 'll crush him like a bug . " Upon hearing jeffers ' fighting words , Stark reported to reply simply , " we 'll see . " Here 's more on chandler and jeffers . And something really strange . Fred jeffers , rupert chandler 's man , Went missing back in 1925 . Was never found . What is this ? A 17-round glock 9mm semiautomatic . Why do you have it ? In case I need it . Have you ever used it ? Yes . Are you in trouble ? No . Are you afraid of someone ? Afraid ? no . I 've seen cuts on your face . There was one last week . You were wearing makeup , but ... Sometimes I get into fights . Wh--why ? My brother . There are people out to hurt him . I protect him . Who protects you ? I do . Why are we doing this ? Why is myron stark so important ? He was doing something , and it doesn 't make sense to me . I need to find out what it was . None of this makes sense to me . Not you , not the gun , not the guy in the photograph . I know . I 've never fired a gun before . Do you want to ? Sure , but ... Wait . N--no. we can 't do this here . Grip it with both hands . Squeeze the trigger slowly . Slowly . Oh , yeah . Oh , my god . I 'm terrible at this . John . No , I don 't know how . What , you live in a cave ? Come on . What am I supposed to do ? I have no idea . I just pushed those buttons at random . And you sucked . Hey , check you out , mr. normal . Kill him , alex . Come on , johnny . I 'm rooting for you . * * * * Dude , you suck . Hey , come on. kill him , alex . I 'm gonna go. you stay here if you want . No , john , wait . This was a mistake . Well , i- - I 'm coming with you . Whoa whoa. you 're going ? with that weirdo ? Yeah . I 'm sorry. we have to go . Oh , no , no , no. wait . Give me my lighter back . Your what ? You took my lighter . No. c--no. come on , john. let 's go . No , no , no. give it to me . Give it to me. get off me . Hey , hey , you leave her alone . Hey , no one 's talking to you , weirdo . Don 't. don 't. stop. come on . Watch out , man . Give it to me , you screwy bitch . John. john . Take the damn lighter . Come on , john. let 's get out of here . I 'm out here on mulholland drive Where a hiker has discovered What appears to be the body of a man who died over 60 years ago . Tom jacobs was out for an early morning walk When he spotted a piece of metal in the ravine . Tom ? I saw what looked like the bumper of a car . But when I got closer , I could see that it was one of those old-timey ones , You know , like--like you see in the movies . And then I saw the bones . Personal effects found in the vehicle Reveal the remains to be those of fred jeffers , A man who disappeared in the 1920s . Wait ! what are you doing ? What are you- - What do you want ? No ! Please stop ! no ! " jeffers ' disappearance " was a terrible blow for chandler , " who endured a string of tragedies " starting with the death of his beloved son will , Who died on new year 's eve , 1920 . " New year 's eve , 1920 . Let 's get ' em out of here . That 's rupert chandler 's boy . Let 's cover him up. let 's get him out of here . Come on . Will chandler died in the speakeasy fire . And myron stark was there . So there must be a connection . I thought you were gonna kill that guy . Why 'd you call me ? Because . I wanted you to come . Weird way of showing it . Oh , the flirting with mike thing ? I 'm a teenage girl , john . We do that kind of crap to guys we like . The loner weirdo ? I don 't get it . Never gotten it . My old foster parents Are these ' 60s hippies . Always talking like they were single-handedly saving the world Because they recycled . They called me the deviant . Like , " the deviant got a " c " in math . " " should we take the deviant to see bruce hornsby ? " That 's why I came up to you that day , john . Because I thought since you 're a weirdo , You might get me . My foster parents used to call me the delinquent . So you did take the lighter . I like shiny things . Bad habit . What happened to your real parents ? They died when I was little . In a fire . Why were you in a foster home ? You have your mom . She was in a mental hospital . That explains things . She was engaged once . He was a pretty cool guy . Didn 't work out , But he was kind of the only friend we had . Little while ago , he , uh , helped us with something . There was an accident and his new wife died . And he left . That 's what happens . I shouldn 't be around people . Is that why you went nuclear on mike ? No , that 's ... That 's other stuff . Do you want to talk about it ? Sometimes , yes . Mostly no . But sometimes yes . I found will chandler 's obituary . I 'm kind of peeing right now. can 't it wait ? 400 people came to his funeral . He had a lot of friends . His father had a lot of money. there 's a difference . I think stark killed him . We don 't even know if they knew each other . And if stark wanted to kill chandler , Why take out 43 innocent people ? It happens . Do you ever think about dying ? About what ? Or about suicide ? Why would I think about that ? Because there 's something wrong with you . Gee , don 't ever look for work as a counselor . I 've never thought about killing myself . Not for a minute . It would destroy my mom , for one . I couldn 't do that to my family , To the people who love me . Could you ? Anyways , I 'm not sick anymore . I mean , I have to get a scan every six months . But so far I 'm clean . Earlier when I cross-referenced the names of survivors From the fire , this woman 's name Came up in a documentary about the roaring ' 20s . It might tell us more about what happened Inside the speakeasy . Film vault 's on the top floor . You 'll have to go alone . Why ? No wheelchair access . You 're really strong . I work out . Wow. look at all this . Dvds are all right , but this is the real deal . Silver nitrate. raw . Before film makers figured out all the tricks . Pure humanity on film . None of that computer generated , Digital crap they do today . All these people captured , frozen in time . They never age . I mean , 100 years could pass . They 'll still be here. still look exactly the same . It would be nice , wouldn 't it ? Freeze yourself in a moment . The best moment of your life . Have things never change . Be beautiful Healthy strong . Anyway ... Don 't let me get all a.e. housman on you . Uh , the documentaries Are up there . We would go out to the gin joints every weekend . We 'd drink , and smoke , And dance the black bottom , the charleston , The shimmy . Oh , I was a real bearcat back then . And I was crazy in love With this prizefighter . We were together there , The night when the fire started . He was helping everybody out . And I just remember ... Sitting on the curb ... Crying . People said that , uh , Someone threw a bomb in the door . Now , to tell you the truth , I was pretty zozzled.That 's what we called it then . But I didn 't see a bomb . Uh , what I did see was this , um , This flash of blue light And sparks , Then the craziest thing . This man in the middle of the room , Naked as a jaybird . I don 't know . Maybe I just imagined the whole thing . Who knows ? Probably the liquor talking . The fire , it was an accident . Yeah , sounds like there was some electrical problem . He didn 't mean to kill all those people . No. of course not . It 's just like in the wizard of oz When the house falls on the witch . Give me your clothes . Hey , where are you going ? I know what he was looking at . He was measuring the stars ' radial velocity , The distance in parsecs , and the cartesian coordinates . What ? why ? To pinpoint the date . You can tell the date by looking at the sky ? * * * * Stellar motion can be used to calculate What the sky will look like for hundreds of years In the future or the past . Why is the date so important ? It 's not. unless it 's the wrong date . * * * * Myron Stark was in the wrong place At the wrong time . " if we cry because the sun has gone out of our lives , " our tears can prevent us From seeing the stars . " Chandler 's eulogy for his son ? " today is a day for mourning . " but it is also a day to remember my son . " a gifted young man with a grand heart . " a budding architect , " his dream was to build pico tower " on the corner of 3rd and pico . " that was his land , " the soil where his dreams were to take root . " it will remain his land forever , " never to be sold or developed . " instead , his legacy will live on " in a memorial garden I will plant there in his honor . " That can 't be right . There is a pico tower in downtown la . It 's an architectural landmark . We took a field trip there in third grade . Someone must 've built it . Tax records . They show Chandler 's rivalry with Stark Cost him everything . His business went under in july 1925 . His assets were auctioned off To pay off his debt , Including the property at 3rd and pico . Bankruptcy. tragic accidents . The death of a beloved son . It 's like the family 's cursed . Mr. chandler , I 'm myron stark . Do I know you ? No , you don 't know me . Mr. chandler 's in a hurry . I 'm interested in purchasing a piece of property . 3rd and pico . That land 's not for sale . I 'll pay twice what it 's worth . Are you deaf ? Are you deaf ? He said it 's not for sale . Does it say who bought it ? the pico property ? M.s. stark ? So he not only bought the land , But he designed it himself ? The building . It 's about the building. what is ? Stark accidentally killed the man Who was going to build it , so he had to build it himself . Everything he did was to drive chandler under And get him to sell that land . Okay . There must be a reason why stark needed to build it . You wanna know the really weird thing ? Stark disappeared two weeks before the building opened In may of 1927 . Disappeared ? Fell off the face of the earth. never seen again . What 's happened at pico tower since it was built ? Anything important ? Anything on new year 's eve ? New year 's eve when ? Any new year 's eve . Not that I can see . In fact , it 's closed now . They had to retrofit after the last earthquake . I 'm not sure when they 're reopening . * * * * * * * * * * Hey . I thought you left . What are you doing back here ? Are you all right ? what happened ? I 'm fine . Your brother again ? I 'm fine . You never touched your donuts . I wasn 't hungry . Your muscles are weak . It was difficult for you to pull the trigger Of the glock . And you 've lost 8 % of your body weight In the past two weeks . When I carried you to the film vault , I weighed you . Wait , what ? This whole night , the entire time , You 've been examining me ? What--what the hell is going on here ? Your cancer is back . You have a secondary tumor in the long bone of your arm And possibly your lungs . Are you joking ? No . Then you 're crazy , you don 't know what you 're talking about . Ewing 's sarcoma. first identified in the 1920s- - I know what it is , okay ? I 'm the one in here ! No wonder you don 't have any friends . You can 't just do things like that . You can 't just show up whenever you need somethin ' . You can 't carry a gun around and freak people out , And walk into the bathroom when a guy 's taking a leak And ask him if he 's gonna kill himself . And you can 't just blurt things out Like " you have cancer , " Especially to someone who 's already had it . You have no clue , do you ? You have no idea what it 's like To have something inside of you , Something that 's damaged . It 's like a bomb ... Waiting to go off . I need to finish my paper . You should make an appointment With your oncologist . The tumor 's still small . Get out . Where were you all night ? Out . Carbon chain c24 . Lanolin and red dye # 27 . You were with riley . We 're closed . Is eric here ? Eric ? He works the night shift. he lets me in . I have no idea . They just called and asked me to come in . Sorry . Do you like donuts ? I have one glazed , one rainbow sprinkle , One cinnamon twist .

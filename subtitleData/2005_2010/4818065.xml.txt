Next ! Next ! Next ! Rouge ! Rouge ! you 're not moving well ! Rouge ? Next ! Okay ! you don 't have to keep pushing yourself . I-I 'm fine . Next ! Slash ! Why are ... you here ? my dear . I 'm sure you 'll find a use for it . This ... well if it isn 't the Commissioner . What brings you all the way out here ? Is Eclipse coming along well ? of course . An invitation . To the first OCB league match . Huh ? What is this ? A Change in Dunk Mask 's Play caused by the recent match against the idol team Eclipse ? " it says ... Bel . Has Dan changed at all ? No ... right ? Maybe ... A New Departure for Dan . A Clash of Fate in the Desert . This guy has always been frighteningly accurate so far ... And it seems like he 's been trailing Dan a long time . huh ? What if he 's some super stalker ? Everybody 's looking at us . It 's because of those photos that were spread around . No reason to let it bother you now . That kiss was setting a trap for all of you ... I 'm your enemy . Why are you being nice to me ? What 's so great about him ? ! This is his profile ... do you know ... Rouge ? No . Lower your butt more . Don 't follow the ball with your eyes . Mr. Dan . Don 't call me Mr. Dan . Mr. Dan . Good grief . Why do I have to give you a crash course ? I want to get a little nearer to your level so I can help as a reserve ! but it 's up to you whether you can do it . hypocrite ? Shut your face ! with basketball it 's really getting better through just playing . You 'll get better as you play . Shut up ! The moon person from before ... Moon ? Dan . Y-You 're that jerk who ... A flying leap ! Who are you ? ! I 'll tell you . What ? ! Outta the way ! Shit ! Pitiful ! Even though it 's two-on-one . Dunk Mask ? Idol Red ! Who the hell asked you to help ? That 's rude ! It 's Miss Rouge ! Just concentrate on the game . Thank you ! Shit ... Why you ! Move ! Miss Rouge ? ! I 'm fine . you ! You run into someone and can 't even say a word to apologize ? S-Sorry about that ... I swear I 'll get it this time ! Sweat ? Shit ! This was over before it started . Mr. Dan ! Mr. Dan ! Get a hold of yourself ! Mr. Dan ! Mr. Dan ! Mr. Dan ! Don 't call me Mr. Dan ! Where 'd that jerk — ! ? Went home . Shit ! who was that anyway ? Slash . Sla ... ? There 's no one on the moon who doesn 't know of Slash . then ? holds Slash in reserve as his final weapon . that player is the number one hot topic . Who cares about a number one pot topping ? ! It 's clobberin ' time next time we cross paths ! So there ! okay ? I want that back after you wash it . You better wash it ! Are you okay now ? From getting hurt before ? None of your business . What 's that supposed to mean ? ! I 'm asking because I 'm concerned ! what 's wrong with you ? What kind of play was that supposed to be ? Were you just trying to wing it ? I don 't know ! and then some weird monsters showed up ! Monsters ? Listen to yourself . You aren 't some little kid . This is pissing me off ! I don 't want to talk to you ! Mr. Dan ! Miss Rouge . Excuse us . wait up ! Don 't call me Mr. Dan ! Mr. Dan ! I may have heard that name before ... so I thought maybe you knew something . Apparently the Lunar League 's most anticipated rookie or something . Rookie ? This Slash is someone young ? Yeah . Maybe about the same age as Dan ... this is bad . What are you doing ? Finger exercises to keep me from going senile . They 've been giving me so much trouble lately . This one ? { mmmm sound } How did that one go ? ... What 's the deal ? Alan told us . We hear you were acting weird . Tell me . What did you see on that court ? What ? Stop it ! I don 't wanna remember ! Dan ? just leave me alone ! Mr. Dan ? I could hear it . The voice of Dan 's foot . What did it say ? That it doesn 't want to remember . You better make sure you give that back . Or else I bet she 'll never quit nagging . Of course I will . No way I 'm gonna just walk around with something this girlie . is it ? but it 's a team crisis . Aww . You finally recognized Dan as a teammate . What ? So Dan said he didn 't want to remember . And something about monsters ... right ? Probably . spit it out ! I mean ... It probably has to do with Coco . After what happened ... Mine now ! Coco ! right now ! You suck so bad ! It hurts ! Coco ! huh ? ! We can reassemble the shattered bones . But there 's nothing we can do about the shredded nerves . Nothing ... You mean ... I mean it 's no use hoping . No use ? ! You call yourself a doctor ? ! and do it now ! Coco ... you know ... and compared to me ... to some punk like me ... she 's got such a brilliant future as a player ! Please ... Please ! Don 't take basketball away from her ... Dan 's thrown himself into basketball twice as hard as your average person . Maybe Dan runs so hard when he plays because he wants to run away from the past . Miss Sela ? What 's wrong with Sela ? I don 't know ... But just now I felt a manas of terrible sadness . hitting rock bottom ! Can his team survive ? You ! How 'd you find this place ? I have a keen nose . Admit defeat ! Who is it ? no one ! Dan did sorta wash it with his dirty hands . It 's dirty ! There . You got it back . It 's all damp ... crap ! Where 's Rouge ? 689.4 ) } The bath . 642.6 ) } The toilet . here 's an invitation to a league match . so please be prepared . Hey ! Keep your hands to yourself ! I can 't help it ! please ! Jan told me not to meet with you ! Well you didn 't have to hide in here too ! I pushed you in and got caught in the moment ! Don 't forget I 'm here too . So what 're league matches anyway ? Ones hosted by the OCB . You aren 't gonna participate ? Couldn 't care less . you couldn 't anyway . What ? ! No way you could take part in matches with some trauma hanging over you . right ? That 's called trauma ? Thought so . Woman 's intuition . Women are amazing . Women are scary . you 'd be crushed . stupid ! No way ! Oh really ? Wanna try going against me again ? You 're on ! I 'll show you the difference between our abilities . } That 's my line ! Jan left . did we interrupt ? Not at all ! In unison ! Yep ! They 're totally in love ! I said it 's not like that ! Don 't copy me ! What ? ! don 't just toss your stuff around ! Shut up ! Rouge ... I 'm jealous . I want to be all lovey-dovey with someone too ! It 's all going as planned . James . It 's unusual for you to get so involved . Any reasons ? not really . huh ? Just winning isn 't enough . you should make it as interesting as you can . Bigfoots would stand out too much . right ? I 'm still gonna win ! I need to see Dan 's problems with my own eyes . Go Dan ! Not going to happen ! Shit ! Shit ! How about trying to use your head more ? Just running doesn 't get you anywhere . Shut up ! He 's getting his ass handed to him . { sz : lol this is a bit strong for the JP but it fits her tone so well . } Come back stronger ! Dan ! Keep cool ! huh ? Gotcha ! You think you can beat me like that ? Dunk Mask is nothing special ! How sad ! I 'm just getting started ! triple your score . It 's boring winning so easily ! You 're gonna eat those words . Dan has completely lost sight of his own play . Dan . } What the hell ... shit ! isn 't that Dunk Mask ? He 's playing Rouge from Eclipse ! You okay ? You 're all pale . Shut up . Ow ! Oww ! I 'm gonna die ! die ! get a grip ... please ! Rouge ! Rouge ! Now ! A three-pointer ! you finally got some points . Dan ! Did I imagine them ? and I bet you were thinking about a bunch of useless stuff . You like to go just one line too far ! You can 't play without rhythm . right ? It 's the silent places tucked in that make a rhythm stand out and give you a good song . It 's the same with basketball . Get it ? No ... Stuff like that 's beyond you if you can 't read music . What ? ! you know how ? Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti ! Don 't make fun of me ! sometimes you should stand still ! Why you ... Idol Red ! Game set . Signs of resurrection for the man of legend . His participation in the OCB league match a possibility ? I see . Dan has made it out of a long tunnel . But why did you tell me about the accident ? Isn 't that part of the past you don 't want to remember ? Was it all for Dan 's sake ? I thank you . You should make sure to come to the OCB league match . If I feel like it . Do you ... think you 'll ever play ? you could handle a Bigfoot . This is my Basquash . This is hard on you too . These are seeds I sowed myself . Yeah . I hope they grow tall .

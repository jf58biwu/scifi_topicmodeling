Not even walked hand in hand . Are you owe him money ? What game is this ? I know the rules ? The Denklab Paper Game . - I do not know . - I 'll give you a hint . " The need for immediate deployment ... Of Thomas Baldwin in active field service . " Nice title . You invented it yourself or with the smart asses from the basement ? Let 's say it 's me again with the idea . Tom is the best agent I know . Perhaps the best of the department . In the months that Baldwin the 4400 examined , learned this center more than in the whole year he sat behind the desk . He threatened a cop . He protected his son , that the people of the future , whoever they are , chose as their spokesman . His cousin Shawn is one of the 4400 . It sounds like conflict of interest . Dennis Ryland not believe that . Dennis Ryland is no longer the boss here . Maybe you should call Washington . I do not need to call Washington . I 'm under the shortcut . Congressmen , senators , Committee Chairs . They all look here , to me for answers . And that 's why you need an agent as Tom Baldwin exploit . It is important in this case . Perhaps the most important . What funny . That 's here too . Maybe I did it for Marco checked for typos . If you give me another A message sends , then put your own name on it . Mr. Walcott . Come on down . - Arlo . - Mr Walcott . Come on down . Arlo . You heard him . Mr. Walcott , come straight down . I call security if you do not come down . Arlo . This is your last chance . What are you doing up there ? I got it . Arlo . This is your last warning . Arlo , please . Be careful . I 'm coming down . Arlo , be careful . Watch out . I got it . I got it . Oh , my God . No . Lily , I 'm home . Lily , calm down . We do not leave . A crazy stuck all over town . He did not have us . I still find that we should leave . I was scared yesterday . But have you read it ? It is a sermon , not a witch hunt . Maybe , but we feel no longer safe here , Richard . Isabelle does not feel safe . Richard , we are talking often talked about . I do not know why they are with me and do not talk to you . Talk ? Communicates . Anything . Did she say where to go ? They chose a place out ? They recognize it when they see it ? - We can find a city . - We did that already here . Isabelle is six months old . I know she is special , but we are her parents . We decide for her , they are not for us . Isabelle , I know . We have to leave here . You 're right . Absolutely right . You know what , we 're leaving . We stay here . Sign . - What is that ? - Your resignation letter . I thought I got field service . That will get you . With immediate effect . I want results . We have a lot of expensive spirits in the basement who say that 's what you can deliver . So I take the gamble . But I must have certainty . This . I have not filled in the date . If you go over the line , I enter it . I can live with that . Good . Look at this . Tess Doerner . When she was 15 , she was paranoid schizophrenic . Disappeared in April 1955 from the psychiatric hospital . Let me guess : returned without cure her . People heal that did not . We just got phone of the hospital . A nurse is dead . And they say that there is a connection . We pull it out . Wait a minute . We still need to clarify one thing . Suppose you conditions ? - Is this your new home ? - Also yours . All your stuff there , right ? It seems a little our previous house , huh ? I tried it anyway . But one thing is missing . Mama . Yes , I know . Sometimes I can not believe she is not there . But we have tried , Kyle . We did our best . I wish you both better you had best . I 'm sorry . The ... You know , when something terrible happens , like when you were in the hospital , that brings people closer together , or drives them apart . Your mother and I ... I should call her . Say I 'm from quarantine . You do that . She will be pleased . Shawn will love it too . You know I go to him . You 're a good cousin . Do not expect too much . People change in four years . I can not believe that you 're here . I ... I have so long looked forward to this moment . Remember when we went to strike the cage ? - You never hit the curve ball . - I do , you do not . I saved little money , so ... Maybe we should just stop at the golf course . Want to learn to play golf ? I always begged you to . I do a lot of things try , Dad . Make a list . Whatever you want , we do it . Everything . - You can show me . Tonight - Are you leaving ? I just got here . It 's my job , boy . But at the beginning of the list . You take the lesson manual very seriously . Are you sure Tess drew this before they began to build ? She made the first sketch a few weeks ago . They started yesterday with build . And you think the dead nurse involved ? Arlo was on the verge of building B , to make. release a weather vane I think it was the weather vane . Why do you like the other patients in ? I thought about it . These patients never exhibit tive cooperative behavior . And I wanted you to see the thing before the demolition . It 's all right , Kevin . They want to talk to Tess alone . He takes her in great protection . She is his only friend here . Really , it 's okay . - I say that you are coming . - Prima . We saw your drawings , Tess . They are very good . They hear you . There are microphones in the walls . They broadcast by satellite to the submarines . Who does that ? The doctors . The doctors here at the hospital ? Some are here in the hospital . Some sit on the submarine . Well , we 'll talk very softly . They took off my pencils , but they are too late . - Why ? - Because it is built . They want me they contact . So they stopped the plans in my head . Did the doctors in the hospital , or doctors submarine ? Neither of the two . We are talking about people who took me , stupid . The people who took you thus want the patients here build the tower ? They do everything to get me back . They like me . Have the other patients asked for help , Tess ? I do not like talking to them . They are crazy . Arlo was crazy ? I never imagined . Perhaps madness contagious . He dictated a letter . No idea what he has . He clutched at his head and screamed . Wait outside . Now . Stay put . Just stay put . Thank you . Thank you . They become worse , Jordan . They also are becoming more common . - Are you okay ? - Yes . I do not understand . I do not why these attacks come back . I have emphysema cure and leukemia . That baby is getting hit a lot . Remember that only if we find Richard and Lily . You sound pretty confident , Jordan , but it 's been a year ago . Sometimes I forget that they are there . I 'll never forget it . And the men I pay to find also not . Okay , but if I were you , I did not want in the same time when that child . If you meet again may be dead . I have my reasons . The latest news : a revelation about the origin of 4400 . In his new autobiography claims former real estate magnate Jordan Collier that the 4400 were abducted by people from the future . The book contains copies of secret government documents which according to Collier confirm his claims . The documents are from an anonymous source from the National Safety Center . According to the 4400 Collier came back to avoid a disaster that threatens humanity . Why did not you say anything ? Collier claims that the government know this for over a year but the secret kept to prevent panic . The government calls the documents speculative and taken out of context . No matter who took them , or who they brought back . They had to continue . Did not you ? They save the world . What do you think he said ? He is one of them . You are very quiet . I believe in facts . The fact is that I have this radiator should rinse for lunch . You will love to hear that the source of Mr. Collier is no longer anonymous . Agent Hubbard will be prosecuted . And Collier then ? He sold national secrets . Collier must for treason facing allegations , but that does not happen . We can not determine payments traced back to him . And what this 4400 center concerns : until further notice is there constantly patrolled . I want pictures of everyone that comes close . Is it true that Collier tax exemption early ? Apparently . He makes of 4400 a religion ? More a cult . Sect is what the great congregation the little church says . Sect , religion , whatever , where he bases that on ? Have you read this ? Collier claims that he is the 4400 in anyone can unlock . So he thinks a factory worker in Pittsburgh believes he has hidden superpowers ? Most 4400 do not even. such capabilities Not yet , at least . No , but if you thought that there was a chance you have such a gift to yourself ... I think want to join . No . But I understand that people are curious . We always say that biologically the 4400 is not different from us . They are genetically or neurological not changed . As far as we know . But if Collier thinks that people give their lives , and their savings , for a metaphysical pyramid scheme , he soon jolted . Welcome to the center . My name is Devon . - What 's your name ? - Kyle . Pleasant , Kyle . Would you like a tour ? Thanks , but I 'm looking for my cousin . Shawn Farrell . Sorry . Mr. Farrell is not available now . Can you say Kyle looking for him ? He lives with you ? I unfortunately can not be with you talk about our members . I will not talk , but my cousin greetings . Your name and number like ... I do not care . What is the problem ? There is no problem . Talk to Shawn . If he does not want to talk , okay . - But that 's his choice ? - Want to lower your voice ? I have nothing against you personally . I hope the aliens your body ever return . It does not matter . I think Shawn myself . Right this way , sir . - Get your hands off . - You need to leave . Nobody said he was so great . - That he was not . Yesterday-not . They do not look and patients . - That they are not . - Dr . Clayton ? I know what you will say . We walk back . We pick up in the afternoon . Does the whole hospital it ? It is the only way off to get it . Sorry . Randy , Winston , we here need help . Dr .. Cho is there the satellite dish . Good . First , the patients and now the staff . If this is mass hysteria , it expands . Ridiculous . We have work to do . Important work . Let the doctors do their rounds . They may care for their patients . The tower and courtyard are prohibited . - Did you get that ? - Yes . Look how big he is . That I would in my backyard want . The outing is over . Wait in the car . Yesterday wanted some patients working on this thing and today the entire hospital . If we remove Tess here , the pressure then disappear ? - I do not know . - It 's worth a try , right ? Well , I got you . - It 's all right . - I am not bad . - No . - That 's not me . Nobody says , Tess . Why stop you then wires in my brain ? Parole , nobody hurts you . They all say that , before they hurt you . Why am I being punished ? I 'm good . Really . I only do what they want . Guards . Here . Kevin . Kevin . - Come on . - Come on . - It 's all right . - Kevin . I got the medical report Tess . Let me guess : physically all right . The 4400 are in each case consistent . Tess draws a tower or a monument . Yes , or a beacon . And around her everyone starts to build . They can not help it . They have to work . They 're like ants . Come here . The queen secretes a substance from that the other ants controls . The workers work through until the work is finished . It does not matter if one dies or that the anthill washed away in a storm . They just keep on working . Unless you remove the queen . Maybe our workers as well as responsive . So the future sent a strange ant queen back with a blueprint for an interstellar walkie talkie ? Let 's see what Tess can tell us . Do not come too close . Because if your theory is correct everyone is susceptible who comes near her . Well , I 'll talk to Tess . You go Garrity in the hospital . Those friends of yours , you took , where they want to talk about , do you ? They are so much smarter than you , it 's not fun anymore . I like to believe . They knew you take and send back . Send me back was not good and they know it . I should be there . Where exactly is ' there ' ? There were also doctors . They were nice . All of them . They were nice . Do you remember where you go was brought ? We slept a lot , but not all the time . We wore gray clothes . There was a large building . The doctors wore shiny coats and I miss it terribly . Go on . I like it when you talk about it . Our rooms had windows round , high doorposts with arches in it . The stones were described . Mathematical symbols or so . Inscriptions . Bottles of purple-colored metal and bars with mottled ends . These symbols , Tess , how did they look ? Tess ? Tess , remember what the inscriptions say ? They wait for my post . I need to get in touch . Tess . I ... Tess , wait . Garrity , why did you your phone is not on ? I 'm sorry , it was here a madhouse . - Everything is in order ? - Yes , it 's fine . - We are almost done . - Ready ? The satellite dishes are difficult to connect , but it works . Come on people . Connect the dishes . We have not got all day . I had just a very strange conversation with Tess . It can not be stranger than what I had just with Garrity . Junes gift I do not see it that way . You have to see it so . This book is blasphemy . Buy it if you find that . " The third angel blew his trumpet 'And a star fell from the sky , burning like a torch . " Revelation 8 : 10 . I believe you . The day she came back , was the beginning of the end . You can find more about it I , I believe . Whether you get the book from the store or my son does it for you . No way . You know what you 've got there , woman ? Just a book . The gate to hell . - Is that child yours ? That 's my daughter . Samples bring monsters . Richard . - What 's going on ? - We have to go here . Now . Hey . Garrity , what happened ? The guys you sent , can not do anything . Park said he had experience with welding , so ... Experience what ? Small fire start ? Now it is our schedule . Someone already called the fire department ? We have to go . TO BE CONTINUED

 ( radio static ) ( engine rewing ) ( engine idling ) ( engine rewing ) ( twig snaps ) ( grunting ) ( snarling ) ( growling ) ( Man narrating ) The more my weapons are bloodied , the greater my fear . ( snarling ) ( howling in distance ) ( howling continues ) ( footsteps approaching , panting ) ( snarling ) When nature took her revenge , I had a rifle , the last symbol of a mechanized world . But that was five years ago , Father . Now nature laughs at me . The savages are her gift to us , the walking dead . I am at her mercy . The primitive man . She knows my sins , has seen the things I have done , the acts of murder , of cannibalism , of madness . Will God ever forgive me ? I miss my rifle . ( radio static ) ( breeze blowing ) Is there a world outside of my own ? Or has God already forsaken me ? Is that why I 've waited all these years for Hareem Jabbar ? He said he is a man who comes from the East with promise of a new world . I wonder now whether he 's even alive . I wonder why I choose to wait for him here , the birthplace of the savages . I can still hear them , even now . ( growling , yelling ) ( growling , yelling ) ( snarling ) ( yelling ) ( snarling ) ( rustling ) ( footsteps approaching ) ( growling ) ( splat ) ( growling ) Our armies plundered the East for oil to preserve our way of life . Our bombs rained down from the sky , and 2 billion Easterners perished . The army said you weren 't native , Father , that you chose to fight alongside the Easterners . Only now do I understand your actions . When the oil ran out , the Corporation turned on us . ( helicopters approaching ) Those who survived were left with a fate far worse than death . I know they are coming for me , Father . - ( growling ) - ( gunshots ) ( snarling ) ( growling ) ( growling ) ( growling ) ( growling ) ( growling ) ( growling ) ( roars ) ( snarls ) In order to destroy your enemy , you must first understand them . That was what you taught me . The savages are learning , and so will I. ( growls ) ( growls ) ( roaring in distance ) ( growling ) ( snarling ) ( snarling ) ( growls ) ( growls ) ( growls ) ( growls ) ( screaming in distance ) ( screaming continues ) ( screaming ) ( grunting ) What is this war I feel in my heart , Father ? What is this force driving me to kill ? Is it God ? Is God a destructive force ? Was God beside you in the desert when you fought , before the war claimed you for itself ? Is it He who decides whether we live or die ? I wonder how many you killed . Were you remorseless in the face of your enemy ? I have lived the life you taught me . I have survived through slaughter . I have sacrificed my own humanity in all this bloodshed . Am I strong enough to fight to the last breath ? I have to see them as they are , Father . Not as human , as savages , as the enemy . They are the manifestation of the drug which destroyed so much of our world . But now they are evolving . No longer do they kill one another . No longer do the rely on scent or sound alone . Now they begin to see . And now I must face them . I know many more will soon come to kill their devil . I have waited for Hareem but I wait no more . Whether I prevail in battle or not , I need to believe there is a world outside of my own . ( growling ) ( growling ) ( snarling ) ( panting ) I 'm not here to harm you ! You hear me ? I 'm not here to harm you ! I am merciful , Father . I am merciful . ( howling in distance ) ( howling in distance ) ( howling in distance ) ( coughs ) So many bad things . ( coughs ) The prison camps . Made sense . My wife , I see her . What happened to you ? Where are you ? I see angels ... bringing death . I want to die . I want to hold my wife . I want to ... be close ... to my son . Salam . Salam . Sala - ( flies buzzing ) Hey . How long - You 're deaf . Can you lip read ? Max . ( coughs ) The army 's coming . They 're clearing the towns and cities of Biosyns . ( coughs ) ( mimics explosion ) You understand ? I didn 't think there were any survivors in the South . Doesn 't matter . ( groans ) It 's all right . It 's morphine ... for the pain . Should I believe him ... or should I kill him ? ( gunshots ) ( gunshot ) You stay here , you die . You understand ? Listen to me , you deaf bastard . You stay here , you die . You have your father 's strength , Max . His courage . You 're my creation . My beautiful creation . You have to look deep within yourself . You will understand . And you will not be afraid . Not be afraid . Do you hear me ? Go . Go . I need to believe , Father . ( crying ) What 's wrong ? Come on , get up ! Let 's go ! Come on ! We haven 't got time for this ! I 'm okay . Just give me a minute . ( growling ) For Christ 's sake ! Shoot them ! ( groans ) ( panting ) It jammed . I 'm sorry . Zac , are you all right ? Are you all right , Zac ? That second shot was not from you . Jesus . What is it ? Zac ? Keep your head down ! ( gunshot ) Oh , fuck . A Tracker . I said keep your head down ! Did you get him , Zac ? Did you get him ? Would you shut up , will you ? Let me think ! Can 't you just shut up and let me think ? Come on ! Go on ! What are we gonna do ? Zac , what are we gonna do ? I think I got him . Fuck . We just keep going . I mean , we just keep going . Always be sure . What ? I told you aim and fire ! One shot ! What 's the matter with you ? I 'm sorry . Your helmet and jacket , take ' em off . Zac , no . I don 't want it to end like this . Please , let 's just keep going . We can make it . We can make it . Take ' em off ! Listen . Anything happens , you run . Understood ? You run . You find the Resistance . I want you to ... ( groans ) Fuck it . I let her get close . I do not resist . I need this , Father . You put the gun down ! I 'll kill him ! I 'll cut his throat ! It wouldn 't do either of us any good . Zac ! What are you waiting for ? Zac ! Zac ! Listen to me , girl . You kill him , you kill the antidote . Oh , no , you lie . There is no antidote . None your pay grade allows . Oh , you 're lying . The Corporation doesn 't want to cure them , it wants - Pick it up . Pick it up ! He can 't hear you . He 's deaf . It 's a fusion of Max 's blood and the Biosyn 's . See how there 's no trace of ciodine in it ? How do I know this is his blood ? Zac , no ! You know what these fuckers did to my family ? Zac , wait ! Please ! Don 't do it ! He 's lying ! He 'll kill us ! I 'm not here to kill you . Zac , please ! Put the rifle on the ground ! Now ! Turn around and move away ! Do it , you fuck ! Show us . You just expect us to believe you ? Just because his blood can 't be infected does not make him the antidote . Bullshit . Stay down or I 'll blow your fucking head off ! Where are you taking him ? I hadn 't decided . What does that mean ? It means my orders were to locate and neutralize him . Neutralize ? This fucking guy - They why keep him alive ? I know you . I 've seen you in my dreams from the prison camps . You 're a scientist . What 's he talking about ? What 's he talking about ? You weren 't at the camps . I 'm sorry . What the hell 's he talking about ? What the hell 's he talking about ? I 'm sorry . We had no choice . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Zac , I tried . The Corporation gave us no option . You told me you were working on a cure . My wife ! I 'm sorry . I wanted to tell you . Believe me , I did . I just didn 't know how . You used me . To get to the Resistance ! You used me ! There is no Resistance . I was personally involved - ( grunts ) I 'm sorry . My wife ! My child ! Zac , I 'm sorry . You 're sorry ? Sorry ? Sorry doesn 't bring her back ! Oh , God ! ( shouts ) Get away from me ! We worked on so many of you . The ones that went crazy were released . They went on a rampage . The bull-market massacre . How is it possible - Possible for me to disobey an order ? I 'm still human . Couldn 't alter that completely . And if I was going to kill you , you 'd already be dead . I don 't remember you . What 's your name ? I 'm 21275 . Your real name . Rachael . Is the Resistance dead ? Yeah . Then where are you taking him ? South . No ! Get out of the way . What are you doing ? He 's unstable and unpredictable . He 's no reason to live . Then you may as well kill me , too . He can 't be trusted . And you can ? Jesus . No . No , I order you not to kill him . You order me ? You no longer have the freedom to enslave , Rachael . He 's already got ' cause enough . You have no idea where we are , do you ? The Corporation is driving the Biosyns out into the open , to slaughter them in their thousands . Are you in love with him ? All right , I 'll cut him loose . He 'll live hard , but he 'll have a chance . Or I shoot him . You decide . Goddamn you . I 'm offering you the chance to keep your life . We don 't need you . Right . You were doing just fine till we showed up . Max and me will scout ahead . You better not be here when I get back . He had his chance . Zac , please ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for everything , I won 't let him do it . Don 't do this , not now ! I 'm sorry , Zac . You have to believe me . I tried to tell you ! The Trackers , they were always under the influence of the Corporation . They just made you believe it ! ( spits ) You better not give me a reason . Forgive me . ( Max ) They would have come from the Corporation 's Red Zone . the last hive of civilization . They have traded hope where there is none . There are no walls to protect them . Out here there is only death . Are you infected ? No . First the sickness , then the strength , then you turn . Satisfied ? You don 't have to be bitten to be infected . Can I talk to you ? What can you tell me about him ? Was he alone when you found him ? Yes . Did he attempt to communicate with you ? Die he tell you anything ? No . Max Carter . Does the name Linda Canavan mean anything to you ? No . She was one of the Corporation 's chief scientists , the one who opposed the depopulation program and revolted . She created the Biosyns . " Nature 's punishment for the cruelty mankind have inflected upon the Earth , " that 's what she said . Mankind would survive without the need for food or water , but they would basically - Bunch of bloody savages . So what ? Put a bullet in their head , and they 're dead . Listen to me . Linda Canavan had a son called Max . He disappeared shortly after she died . She took her own life . They all did . I just thought Max might have - Look , no oil , 16 million people on the verge of starvation , and the virtual collapse of society . Create the lie , instill the fear . The Jundies are coming to get you . They 'll blow you up , poison your water , but we , the Corporation , will protect you . You know something ? I still have an image in my head of going from my home to the city , seeing all those people waiting in line for the shots outside the clinics , shots that one month later would kill them . I understand all that , but what you 've got to - You don 't understand anything , that 's your problem . There is a logic to what they did . Depopulating 3 / 4 of the country in order for the elite to survive is much easier than dealing with a mass revolt . But there was a revolt in the South , the Resistance . How can you be so naive ? Look around you . We 're already dead . And Max ? His obvious importance to you ? I have my reasons . What 's that supposed to mean ? Do you believe he 's the antidote ? Look , I wanted to ask you something . Gotta piss . What ? I have to piss . So what are you looking at me for ? ( unzipping ) ( snarling ) Where does he think he 's going ? ( growling ) Are you trying to attract attention ? ( Max ) Will God decide or will I ? They 're coming ! ( growling ) ( dogs barking in distance ) Dogs will keep them at bay for a while . You 're positive there 's no other way through ? Not with all this baggage . There 's a way , god damn it . There 's a way . I could get in amongst them . Draw enough of them away , create an opening . ( spits ) Off the coast of Hamala , I was in command of protecting the last of the oil tankers that we managed to secure . Before Kazakhstan blew itself to shit . I had 30,000 men protecting 20 tankers , enough oil to keep society functioning for another year , when they opened up on us . These people ... they blew up themselves back to the Dark Ages . They hit us with everything they had . First tanker gets hit . ( imitates explosion ) All that burning oil . Thought the ocean was on fire . We hit their shoreline . Pounded it . Still they came at us . Wave after wave . Man , woman ... child . RPGs screaming towards us like fireworks in the night sky . That night , 30,000 men and 20 tankers went into the ocean . 5,000 men and two tankers made it home . ( speaking foreign language ) That was a - That was a hard situation . Like an adrenaline shot . They 're like the old days . Jacking up methamphetamines before battle . Pity the undesirables . May they sleep forever . Man 's predisposition is not determined by the color of his skin . Predisposition to what ? Evil deeds . It 's gonna kick some . ( groans ) I 'm ready . ( Max ) Why must I bear this burden ? Tell me something . What the Corp. did to people like me . The undesirables . The Easterners and the convicts . I try to see my wife , to remember her , but it 's just a blur . But I know she existed . I know . My son , too . What happened to her ? You were created out of necessity . We lost so many troops to the oil wars . The resistant . I couldn 't erase your memory completely , though . Brainwashing , drugs . What happened to my wife ? What 's your name ? Jamal . you killed her . That 's how they tested your proficiencies . Kill her . I 'm so sorry . By now , they 'll seen I 've gone rogue . They 'll send a kill squad to neutralize me . How long ... do we have ? ( groaning ) ( high-pitched screaming ) Do you honestly believe Max is the antidote ? Save your strength ! Do you believe ? If you do , then try it out on me . Max , get out of the way ! She 's finished ! She 's infected ! Get out of the way ! Please . Why is he so important to you ? Fine ! Forget it ! I 'll do you both ! He ... needs us . Max ? Oh , my God . You 're telling me this whole time you 've heard every word ? You 're mute by choice ! Speak up , you little bastard ! Because ... of ... my mother . You are Max Canavan . Did she tell you that your blood could reverse the drug ? No . Right . Only that you couldn 't get infected . That 's why when your blood gets in their system it kills them . Like that one that took a bite out of your neck . I don 't know what you are , what 's in your blood , but you 're not a antidote . It 's over . If you wanna see what your blood will do to her , go ahead , do it . See for yourself . You think you know what you 're doing , but you don 't . You don 't know . The savages . Savages ? You don 't understand them . Enlighten me . ( muttering , indistinct ) They are growing together ... to ... to stay alive . Max , that 's impossible . The drug ... the drug inhibits all basic human instincts . Apart from one ... they need to survive . That much they do understand . You little bastard ! What else did that mother of yours tell you ? Save ... your strength . ( roaring ) Fucking Zac ! Your flares . What ? Make me a fire . You better be right about this ! Get out of the way , Max ! I 'm not fucking around anymore ! Wait ! Do you think I want to kill her ? She 's turning for God sakes ! We still have time ! We 're out of time ! Now move ! ( roars ) Aah ! ( screaming ) ( gunfire ) ( gunfire continues ) ( shouting ) Max Canavan . My name is Hareem Jabbar . I 've traveled across five oceans and seven seas to find you . I promised your father . We were - ( speaks foreign language ) - blood brothers . He told you somebody would come , no ? I 'm here to help you , my friend . Many Biosyns are - ( groans ) I have no choice . They have to know . ( crying ) Max . ( gunfire ) ( gunfire in distance ) ( footsteps approaching ) No ! ( growling ) ( grunts ) What are you doing ? Go over there . Go ! God has forsaken - God ! God stopped deciding life expectancy a long time ago . Max ? I 'm here . It 's all right . It 's all right . ( growling ) ( speaking native language ) No . ( gunfire in distance ) Stop ! ( shouting ) ( shouting ) ( shouting ) ( shouting , indistinct ) ( shouting ) Go back ! Go back ! Go ! ( gunfire ) No ! ( screaming ) ( gunfire ) ( grunts ) ( roars ) ( roars ) ( gunfire ) ( shouting ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) There is a war being waged against us , a war we did not start , a war we did not ask for , but a war we will have to fight . I know now what I must do . I know there is a world outside of my own . I know we here are the vanguard . Subtitled By J.R. Media Services Burbank , CA

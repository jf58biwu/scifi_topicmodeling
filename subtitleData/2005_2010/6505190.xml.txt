 Previously on Forbidden Science Endless possibility , that 's what 4ever Innovation offer you . Here all your dreams are possible through the advance of science . - Hey you know anything about this ? - It takes a photocopy of your brain . Every thought , every memory you ever had ... wicked , huh ? I can pretend to be like everyone else , but let 's face it , I 'm a clone , with the memories of a death woman . God , I need a normal relationship . Hi , is this Flash Gordon ? - This is my favorite part . - Mine too . Theater Jomblo Rev siGantenG Forbidden Science Episode 5 Hotzone Man , I wish you learn to knock ! I way behind schedule on all this upgrades . Good thing your work is your hobby . This new virtual stuff ... It 's incredible , man ! You gotta try it ! Not my speed . I 'm more of romance . Eddie . Hey , Eddie ! Hey beautiful . Nice outfit ! Come on , let 's get it right . You got HTMI3 cable . Just plug it in , the arm processor already know what data to copy . Now listen , these guys do not fuck around . I know , if I leave a minute past my shift , I get a full securty check out . I know , Dante . Good , you done your homework . I guess compared to all those military ops , this is good stuff . Not if I get caught . Eddie ! This is a great thing you do . 4ever makes a fortune of these biotech secrets . But once we make the data public , it 'll be open source . Everyone benefits . And the world of harmony just a felony break-in away . You don 't strike me as a crusader type . Why are you doing this ? I got my reasons . We know the gold chip is functional . Julie is the living prove of that . So tell me , what 's keeping us at finding practical applications ? The problem of the gold chip is just a prototipe , design to works exclusively to Julia 's brain pattern . We still trying to figure out how to modify the chip so it 'll record and download on anyone . Human or clone . Yeah , and adding one percent of memory to another person 's brain is a bit messy . The new memories could stick or flip and even lead to psychosis . What about surpressed memories ? The side effects can be devastating . Like monsters from the " IT " ? Like what ? Doctor Morbius from the forbidden planet , 1956 ? Well , utilize a clone . Generate the number 11934 right now , for this such contigency . We still have the donor problem . I mean ... Do you know anyone willing to put all their memories for public consumption ? Can you show me a law stating a dead person own the rights of theirs memories ? The crucial issue is , none of you considered this a financial . Monday morning I need to honestly asses the profit / loss of our current projects . And I 'd be lying if I didn 't put this on the loss side . You have 72 hours to show me that this project is a glimer of light , or it 'll be a memory . Let 's get to work . Hi , Julie , it 's David . Listen , we need to talk . I don 't know what happen yesterday , but I really feel that we have something ... Please give me a call back . Colin is really riding our asses . No , at least have something good . - We really need a break through on this . - Well , if my idea works it give us a way to monitor the process and shut it down before somebody has a complete mind fuck . - Is that the medical term ? - Yeah , I use it all the time . Sounds more offical in German . Sorry ! No , my fault . - Who 's that ? - Who 's what ? Oh , are you getting jealous ? What , jealous of him ? I have IQ at 213 and have more degrees than pro-tractors . He just a janitor with a tone of - Gaudius Maximus . - I 'll take that as a yes . Your lab is down that way . I have to go to make sure that my waste basket is full , and just waiting to be emptied . Oh God ! - Yeah ? - Hi . Remember when you told me to call you if I ghad anything that figured weirds ? - I think I got something special here . - What 's so special ? Well , it 's been dead for about an hour , there 's no ID per se ' , but best of all , - I think you know this guy . - See you in 15 . I working alone tonight . Save you better cash . What makes you think I know this person ? Coz he had this on . - Nice likeness . - Shit ! Yep ! Found it in Red Lake zone , probably crossed the wrong pimp .

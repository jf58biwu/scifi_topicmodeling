 Yes ! That is the last time you choose a film . I was told it was good . I feel asleep , Rhys . What does it mean , " Special Ops " ? It 's no big deal . Mostly filing . Special admin , really . Can we talk about something else ? Oh , come on , it 's your first day tomorrow , I 'm excited for you ! Big promotion . Secondment . You 'll be brilliant . Let 's have an early night . Check , please ! Bloody hell ! Is that plane on fire ? It 's not a plane . We haven 't paid . Come on . What was that ? MOBILE PHONE BEEPS I 've got to go to work . Simple locating clean up operation . Find that meteorite before anyone else gets their hands on it . Good to see you , by the way . Tosh , you found it yet ? You got enough kit ? Basic tracking and surveillance . The crash site . With this we can tap into CCTV networks , national databases . This is the police computer system . You shouldn 't have this ! Might wanna stop saying " you " and start saying " we " . Crash site is 100 metres ahead . Shit . The amateurs got here first . All right . Usual formation . What 's the usual formation ? Varies . How can a usual formation vary ? Who the hell are you ? ! Sorry ! This area 's restricted . No , it 's all right , I 'm with ... Special Ops . I 'm Special Ops . Torchwood . I 'm with Torchwood . Don 't mess with me , little girl . You 're not with Torchwood . And even if you were ... You 'd have put out the welcome banners ! First of all , she 's no little girl . All the right curves in all the right places . But she is Torchwood . We both are . We 'd appreciate it if you 'd leave us to do the real work . Shall we ? So let 's see what we came for . What do we know ? Bog standard space debris . That 's a technical term . Yeah , thanks . So take all the readings and let 's get out of here . Make yourself useful , sweetheart ! Pass us the big chisel from the toolbox . Not sweetheart - Gwen . One syllable , sure you can manage it . Not sweetcheeks ? Freckles ? New Girl ? It 's a shame your tool 's not big enough for the job , darlin ' . Catch ! Don 't ! Shit ! Put this on ! Is this all I get now , your voicemail ? You 're out with her , aren 't you ? You bastard , you could 've had the decency to text . I 've been standin ' in there all on my own . I 'm sick of this hanging around all of the time waiting for you to show up . I wish I 'd never met you . I wish I was dead , no , I wish you were dead . Call me back . Hiya . Evening , ladies . Hiya , handsome . Very nice . Where do you think you 're going ? I 've been in once , I came out to make a call . There 's no readmission . Um , OK , then , on you go . Watch and learn , boys . I don 't even know your name . Overrated , names . I don 't think ... I can ... hold on . Well , go on , then . Go on ... you 're ... this is ... the best ... Oh ! HE MOANS I 'm so sorry . Seriously , stop saying that . But I am ! I mean , really , I mean really , really sorry . God , I can 't believe it . Didn 't they teach you Health and Safety in the police ? You chucked tools at each other , so ... We didn 't miss . I 'll sort it . Whatever 's happened , I 'll deal with it . What d 'you think has happened ? I mean , it was just gas , wasn 't it ? That can 't be too bad , can it ? Right , because gas never did anyone any harm ( ! ) On the plus side , we 've got good evidence , relatively undamaged . On the downside , there 's an alien on the loose , we don 't know where it is , why it 's here or what it 's going to do . Give her a break ! God , this has been the worst first day ever . We all make mistakes . Now we find and recover whatever came out of there . This might help . Nightclub death been phoned into 999 . Circumstances sound ... a little unusual . Might be connected . Torchwood . Gwen ? Hi ! Bloody hell ! Look at you , all posh . Special ops ! We were wondering . I meant to call . It 's been a bit of a whirlwind . Go on , then , tell us all . Coming ? Yeah , sorry . You can get away now . No point you freezing your arse off out here . Boss of me now , are you ? Say hi to everyone for me . This is all that 's left ? How 's that possible ? The question is how did you know this used to be a body ? Go on , son ! With you all the way ! Bit of a shock , I tell you . We need to see that CCTV . Wow . Oh , my God ! He just ... Came and went . That 's the way I 'd like to go . I 'm sure we could arrange it . How can that be ? It doesn 't make any sense . It 's not possible . Do you know the girl 's name ? Did they arrive together or meet in the club ? Is she a regular ? Would any of the other staff know her ? I dunno ! We get hundreds of people here every weekend . I don 't keep tabs . Thanks for your help . We 've got all we need . What are you talking about ? We haven 't got a clue . We don 't even know her name ! We need a body from the cryo-chamber , close match for the dead guy . Disfigure the face , dump it someplace remote , make it look like a suicide attempt . You have a stash of bodies ? What about his family ? You can 't just fake his death . You want to tell his family he died screwing an alien ? We don 't know for sure . Same elements recorded at the crash site . Traces all over the club but strongest in this area . Something happened here . It 's my fault . If it weren 't for me , he 'd still be alive . That 'll get you nowhere , that thinking . At least now we know a little more . The alien 's taken on a host body . We can 't let her kill again . I said to them , you 're putting yourselves out of work , behaving like this . I can get five Polish lads who don 't take any breaks , happy as sand boys , all for 56 quid above board . I told Niall , I said , " Why should I bother with your moaning mates when I can get this ? " Carys ? Dad ? Hangover from hell , is it ? What did you get up to last night ? I can 't really remember . Mullered , I was . Gotta go . Tony needs the van by nine . You in tonight ? What 's this supposed to do ? I 'm using satellite-tracking data to determine the inward trajectory of the meteorite . He means he 's trying to find out where it 's came from . Sometimes techno babble is good for the soul . So this is a route planner . Not far off . Rhys , my boyfriend , is a transport manager . He does this sort of stuff . On a slightly smaller scale , though . You have a boyfriend ? Yeah . Have you ? Don 't have time with this job . What about you ? You seeing anyone ? You 've gotta be joking . I can get all the grief I need here . None of you have partners ? Just you , newbie . I 'm not being rude or anything ... Well , maybe I am , but ... how do you switch off from all this stuff ? What do you do to relax ? I torture people in happy relationships . SHE SOBS Gas traces confirmed as Vorax and Suranium . My two favourite gases . Can we do a check , and find out what we know about them ? I 'm all over it . What 's this doing ? I 've taken an image of the girl from the CCTV . This cross-checks her face with the UK population . You can 't have every face in the UK on there . That would be against civil liberties , data protection ... Still doing that " you " instead of " we " thing . 119 suspects . It 's supposed to give us a single match . The CCTV was too low res . I 've tried magnifying and augmenting but it just breaks up . The software can 't function properly . It 's narrowed the numbers down . I could check through the rest . The old fashioned way - with my eyes . What about the fingerprints I took off the alley wall ? It was a long-shot , anyway . Just a bit . Least I 'm trying to do something . You 're trying anything . The CCTV must have picked up her arrival at the club . Tosh , can you reformat the image recognition software to trace her journey backwards via street cameras ? It 'll take a while to process . Every possible turn means thousands of probabilities . Have a go . At least we 'll know where she started . We could cross reference that with the remaining face matches . Good one , newbie ! That 's a bit more like it ! Ah ! Ah ! No ! DOORBELL RINGS You 're keeping our website in business . Well , your , er , dad 's not in , then ? Get your clothes off ! Steady , Carys ! All right , that 's enough . Joke over . Barry 's put you up to this , has he ? Shut up ! What 's going on ? ! Put your trousers on and get out . NOW ! It always breaks my heart to say those words . Air quality 's OK . Gwen , look out ! What 's that ? It 's a sort of inflatable cell . Power runs down after an hour . The battery life 's bollocks . Who said you could use that ? Um , I just stopped a prisoner escaping . You know the rules . None of that stuff leaves the building without my permission . Fine . Don 't thank me . Come with us . See what you can find out from her . But aren 't you going to help me ? I don 't know what I 'm doing . Usually better if you don 't say that in front of the prisoner . Are you MI5 ? Where am I ? What do you want ? I think you know , Carys . How d 'you know my name ? I 've never been in trouble . What do you want from me ? I know there 's something living inside you and I know what it made you do . His name was Matt Stevens . His parents lost their only child at 3 : 07 this morning . Ah ! Ah ! You broke my ship . Come on then . Where are you from and why are you trying to invade earth ? You can forget about enslaving us . Who said anything about enslaving ? Well , that 's what you lot do . Aliens . Isn 't it ? No , I just want the energy . The climax . I live off that energy . Right , sorry , just to recap . You 've travelled here to feed off orgasmic energy ? There 's nothing else out there like it . You taste so good . You 're the best hit there is . Ah ! Ah ! No ! Help me Please , get it out of me . Carys ? Hel-lo . Happy birthday , me . OK , first contact with an alien . Not quite what I expected . Oi , you lot ... treat ! Whoa . Wow . She said she had a boyfriend . You people and your quaint little categories . We should really get her out of there . Yeah . I mean , yeah ! Come on ! Just ... record a bit first . No ! It 's no good . It 's got to be a man . Ah ! Oh ! I 'm losing . Promise me you 'll help me . Promise me . MOBILE PHONE RINGS I promise . Hi . You 're not still at work ? ' Fraid so . 'What time will you be done ? ' Not sure when I 'll be finished . Is it exciting , though , have you had loads of excitement ? Erm , some . Er sorry , yeah , is now a good time ? Em , maybe not the best . Oh , pity me , I 'm a Special Ops widow . I 'll call you later . 'Bye . ' Way to go , newbie ! That is what I call a methodical investigation . I can 't wait to see you take down her particulars . What are you doing ? ! Get off me ! That girl 's body is being overrun by I don 't know what . And you think it 's a joke ? All right ! Jesus ! I 'm sorry . We should be helping her . She 's not some lab rat . No , she 's a murderer . You were the one who wanted her caught . How come suddenly she 's your best friend ? You know , strictly speaking , throttling the staff is my job . So who 's for Chinese ? And she said ... " If I 'd known that 's what he was , I never would have married him ! " She knew all along ! She didn 't care . Until he started leaving black piles of mucus in the bathtub . Always the big giveaway . Aliens have no sense of household hygiene . Which reminds me , gotta pee . So what 's he told you ? What about ? Himself ! You 've been here longer than I have . We were banking on you ! You 're a copper , trained to ask questions . You don 't know anything ? Not who he is , not where he 's from . Nothing , except him being gay . No , he 's not . Really , do you think ? Owen does . I don 't . And I don 't care . Period military is not the dress code of a straight man . I think it suits him . Sort of classic . Exactly ! I 've watched him in action . He 'll shag anything if it 's gorgeous enough . We know he 's from America , right ? We don 't know that for sure . No US citizen by the name of Jack Harkness born in the last 50 years . Maybe his identity 's classified . Used to be something big in the CIA . That 's what I reckon . He must have his reasons for wanting to keep things secret . Sure he has . Doesn 't stop me wanting to know what they are . WOMAN SOBS What 's that sound ? WOMAN SOBS What are we doing having Chinese while a girl fights for her life ? Actually , while we 've been eating , the computers have been running a full bio-scan on Carys , profiling her blood , metabolism , organs , skin , the works . So we can see what effect the alien 's having on her . They 've also been taking samples of the air in the cell so we can analyse changes in the environment around her . Now , is that enough , do you want more ? Cos it gets kinda boring . You 've been hidden down here too long . Spending so much time with the alien stuff , you 've lost what it means to be human . So remind us . Tell me what it means to be human in the 21st century . All right . Carys Fletcher , born 13th November , 1987 . School reports , personnel files from her temping agency , swimming badges , reports of her mother 's death in a car crash . And emails discussing the merits of Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger . Why have you done this ? This isn 't about meteorites or gases . We have a trapped girl and we have to save her . When I was with her in the cell , Carys told me she was losing . We have to find a way to keep her fighting , remind her to hold on to who she is . Have I got something on my face ? No . Just , it 's ... brilliant . You are brilliant . Thank you . So we should bring in her dad . You 're kidding . We 've got to find something to connect with her . Make her fight back . Our priority is to contain the alien threat . Not put civilians in a cell with it . We should be helping her . If we don 't , who will , Jack ? Are you always this awkward ? 'You should take a look at this . ' This is the normal chemical composition of the air in that cell . And these are the readings from the last hour . The alien 's secreting an ultra-powerful blend of airborne pheromones . Sex pheromones . 1,000 times more potent than anything we 'd normally experience . She 's a walking aphrodisiac ! I did wonder why I ... Actually , I sort of snogged her . BOTH : We know . Now , still wanna put her father in the cell ? God , no ! We can 't let any man near ... Owen ! Jack , Carys is out of her cell . Cheeky bitch took my swipe card ! 'I 'll deal with it . And tell Owen he needs to work on those abs a bit harder . ' I was taking some readings , you know , keeping an eye on her , and bang . You got away lightly . Be thankful she was only interested in your swipe card . Are you all right now ? Or are you still feeling a bit of a cock ? No exit , sorry . Yeah ? You want a little rough and tumble ? Well , let 's make it a fair fight . You won 't stop me . Put it down ! That 's worthless to anyone but me . Down now ! Or I 'll shoot . Says he will but the eyes say he won 't . I 'm going . Don 't stop me . Please help me . Need me to do any attacking , sir ? Appreciate the offer . Just open the door . Now give me the jar . NO ! After all I said , a severed hand is more important to you than Carys ' life . You want to prove yourself ? Find her . Get your old pals in the police to do something useful for once . All right , I 'll give them a call . Put out an APB - woman possessed by gas knobbing fellas to death . Oi ! You 'd better get in here ! So I 'm trying to interpret the results of the bio-scan . Yeah , but it 's just a mess , like there 's no definitive readings . Because everything in her body keeps changing , nothing stays constant . As soon as you think you 've got something clear , the metabolic rate , the blood pressure all goes wild again . She 's fighting the alien for control of her body . So anyway , I decided to do a comparative diagnostic . Recreate the circumstances , accelerate the process a little , see what 's gonna happen to Carys . Yeah , thanks . I infected the rat with a combination of the Vorax and Suranium gas traces we found at the crash site and the nightclub . Looks fine so far . Once the gases start to flow round the body , the party really starts . The heart rate triples . The brain swells , pressing against the skull . Then the lungs began to shrink , making it impossible to breathe . The pressure increases on all the internal organs until ... Rat jam ! That 's what 's gonna happen to Carys ? " I 'm losing " , that 's what she said to me . Right now , it 's a struggle between where Carys ends and the alien begins . We have to think like her . Put ourselves in her place . It 's the only way to find her . Except we don 't know what her controlling impulse is by now - Carys or the alien inside . The last thing I saw was a fight for control . The overriding factor for the parasite is to have sex . It 's a survival instinct - that 's bound to be the strongest drive . All right , so you 're Carys . You 're desperate for sex cos that 's what the thing inside you needs , but you know it will kill . Where would you go ? I 'd come round and shag you . What ? ! It 's a joke ! Can 't I have a joke with my team-mates ? Right now ? No . So what are we talking about ? Brothels ? Lap dance clubs ? Anywhere there 's eager men ? I know what I 'd do . What the hell are you doing here ? You look a bit wired . I had to see you . You should 've called . Bethan might 've been in . I could kill you . I could bloody kill you ! What the hell was that message you left on my mobile last night ? Sounded like you were off your face . If I wanted to , I could kill you ... now . Look , I 've told you . I 'm not leaving Bethan . You 're a lovely girl , but it 's just not gonna happen . You were my first , see . I never told you cos I thought you 'd laugh . And you 're crap . All you want is to come and you don 't care what 's underneath . Go on , have a go . Get it out of your system . Ah ! Do you love me , Eddie ? Did you ever love me ? No . You could 've saved yourself . What ? We 're too late . Tosh was right , though . She went for the ex-boyfriend . Lucky she 's young . Work your way through my back catalogue , we 'll be here till the sun explodes . Where next ? And how long before that thing destroys her body ? So what 's our next move . Stop the entire city of Cardiff from shagging ? Put bromide in the water supply . No , too hit and miss . The water company got pissed off last time we did that . It could have used any body in Cardiff . Why her ? I just assumed it was random . It 's mining Carys ' life to get what it needs . What else do we know about her ? Anything you can think of ? What are you all looking at me for ? You did all the profiling ! I don 't know . Sorry . She 's great under pressure . There 's gotta be something . What did you say Carys ' job was ? She 's just a temp . Receptionist . Where 's she working at the moment ? I can pull her employment files up . Conway Clinic . You 're joking . What 's the problem ? It 's a bloody fertility clinic . Sperm donors . An unlimited supply of orgasmic energy without all the build-up . Perfect hit . Ah ! Carys . You 're not on today , are you ? It needs more . The energy - it 's not lasting . Sorry ? 'Mr Tunstall , room number one 's ready now . ' MAN SCREAMS What 's this for ? Need a diagram ? I 've never used a gun . You were in the police ! I was on the beat ! I 'll make sure you don 't need to use it . I 'm asking for you to get out ! Relax , I can help . I don 't think so , love , I 'm gay . What do we do if we find her ? How are we going to get it out of her ? Judging by the test results , the gas needed a host because prolonged exposure to our atmosphere is poisonous to it . But our bodies are the perfect environment . If we isolate it from Carys ' body ... It won 't survive for long . Sounds like we have a plan . Force it to die . Just like it did those poor blokes . What about Carys ? Better start praying we get to her in time . Come on ! Out ! Now ! Get as far away as you can ! God , how many more ? In here ! Nowhere to run . All this sex . All we see , all we think . So much beauty ... and so much fear . We want it but we 're so afraid of it ... Ah ! The strain on her body 's too much . Any second now , she 's rat jam . One more and I 'll be strong . Each time , it works less . Each time , the feeling 's weaker . One more . Make me feel alive . Make me feel human . I can 't . I can . Jack ! I 've got a surplus of alive . I 'm giving it away . You really want to feel something ? What 's he doing ? That was just the kiss . Imagine the buzz you get from the rest . Wasn 't exactly the reaction I anticipated . Her body won 't last much longer . Use me . Leave Carys . Take my body as host . Just let her live . Gwen ... I 'm stronger than she is . I 'll last longer . You might be able to save me , I don 't know . OK . Jack ! You can 't let her ! Like she said ... she 's responsible for this . Come on , then . Do it . Leave her . How long can it survive in there ? It was pretty weak . Why ? Bit worried how long that battery 'll last for . Look ... It 's dying . You travel halfway across the universe for the greatest sex . You still end up dying alone . Thank you . Still here ? Everybody else is off doing ... whatever it is they do when they 're not here . How long have you been there ? I wanted to finish off . Do one thing for me . Don 't let the job consume you . You have a life . Perspective . We need that . Who are you , Jack ? I 'm sorry ? You can 't die . You tell me the 21st century is when it all changes , that we have to be prepared . You do . But how can you know ? You think knowing the answers would make you feel better ? Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Go home , Gwen Cooper . Eat lasagne . Kiss your boyfriend . Be normal . For me . So I said , those bloody website ... I 've had years of experience . I know the journeys , I 've driven most of them , I know the best way . Am I boring you ? Sorry . Too grand to care about transport routes now , are we ? Let 's go to bed . You saw the echo of a moment amplified by alien technology . A ghost . .. 40 , 45 years ago . I saw it happen . Ah ! You need to know how to use these . Wait ! I 've see things you wouldn 't believe . No ! Get out ! Help me ! Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd - 2006 Email bbc @ subtitling.co.uk

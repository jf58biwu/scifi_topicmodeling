A list of names . i never saw nor contacted my parents again . I heard later they had believed i had died in the indian wars . I had just enough money in my pocket for a drink . I forgot all about my errand . I returned home as the sun was setting . But i hand that couldn 't lose and no money left to bet with . Instead of thinking of fanny and what she 'd been through , i satisfied my own cry by ... The battlefield in france during the first world war , i put another man in mortal danger in order to save my own son . I stole the formula ... While winning the affections of a good woman there , it became a game to me , I wasted precious time with a son and wife i dearly loved to chase fame and fortune .

Here on earth , we human detectives explore several theories as we gather the facts . I got this one . Ok . Marquez , stay with the vic . Run down the drug angle with the m . E. Let 's find out where chris duncan 's been since rehab , while mister sober over here finds out what tara brown brooklyn means and what that has to do with the price of beans in boston . Maybe he knocked her up , wrote a crummy song about it . Santori . You got your stun gun ? Chris duncan ? There 's a singer by that name . That 's the one . How would i know chris duncan ? Not a lot of white rock singers on this block . Tara brown . Fort greene , brooklyn . You 're the only one . Look , my baby 's sleeping , my son 's at school . I gotta take my shot . You could 've told me at the door you didn 't know chris duncan . You didn 't have to let me in . You 're a detective . I thought maybe you could help me . The cops that are on the case , they 've given up . Jason . My son ... He was nine . I sent him to the bodega . The baby needed milk . He got hit by a car . Killed . Hit-ane-run . Who would do something like that ? Kill my baby ... Just drive away ? Tara , when did this happen ? The hit and run was the same night as the shelter benefit . Chris has a place in park slope . He 's loaded , going home . He kills a kid . Next day he checks into rehab . Cuts up his driver 's license . Well , m . E. Ruled chris ' death a homicide . Methadone o . D. Same as ollie . Chris was going to come clean with tara brown , but someone killed him before he had the chance . Why kill ollie ? What 's the connection ? Are you john ? Yeah . I 'm sorry , but i have some bad news . Frank is dead . Heart attack . We kept him alive for a while last night , but he didn 't have a chance . Congenital arrhythmia . Since he was a kid . He never said . When he turned down the morphine , that 's when i knew . He wanted to die sober . Hmm . I got 93 days . God knows why , but when ruby shoots oswald ... That 's it for me . Good-bye , scotch . Thanks for coming . No choice . Frank told me if i didn 't , i 'd start drinkin ' again and die a hosrible death he was sorry he couldn 't hear your stuff . He said you gotta find somebody else quick . Another human being . That 's it ? Who are you , jack the ripper ? You 're supposed to read your list to somebody else . Ollie was chris duncan 's " somebody else " . He heard chris ' confession . So , they met at the aa meeting . Chris liked him . He was a musician . For a big celebrity , who 's the safest person to tell your deepest secrets to ? A homeless guy . Chris read it to ollie . Ollie was killed by someone who thought he was gonna give chris up on the hit-and-run . And the guitar ? It was a gift . Chris was grateful . Something happens when you do this . I would 've given the moon to the person who heard mine . I walked . He followed . Did you see that ? Sarge , we 're talking about two murders and a dead kid . You go , girl . Ollie was killed because chsis told him about the hit-and-run . Chris was killed because he was about to spill his guilty rock star guts to tara brown , the hit-and-run 's mother . Who killed them ? Ooh . Don 't wait for him . See , this is a chick thing . We 're bonding . Whoever else was in chris duncan 's car . Bonded . it might be - it might be skipping . what 's wrong ? I googled you . Oh , no . I feel violated . It 's not funny . I mean , what are you ? The cia ? Witness protection ? Sara . You 're something , because five years ago , you didn 't exist . I 'm a cop . Cops aren 't in public databases . Your partner is . The chief of detectives is . Family members , schools . Ask me anything . I 'll tell you . Why aren 't you in public databases ? Must be real bad . Something happened . I had to become someone else . What is it ? An undercover thing ? What 's your real name ? John amsterdam . I like it . I 'd like to keep it . I 'd like to keep you . Trust me . Do i have a choice ? No . i had no choice . I had to tell you the truth . Might take a while . I , uh - i brought sandwiches . The truth about what ? You probably want to sit down . So , what ? You some kind of superhero ? Is this your secret lair ? No . You know how i always looked younger than the other dads ? Just listen , omar . Please . The first family i abandoned was my own . In 1620 , when i came to the new world , i was 14 years of age . Hey ! I don 't care about papers . A black suv . It hit him . Never even slowed down . Bad news . Chris duncan never owned a black suv . Hit-and-run in fort greene . Nine-year-old killed . That 's it . The whole story . And in the same day 's paper ... That 's the good news . He did . Ben tucker . A black suv , city-owned . Driver reported it stolen that night , during the concert . Recovered a week later . Stripped . I think we better talk to the councilman . No . Not ben . Why are we here ? Looks different when you stop . A real place . A neighborhood . What are you doing ? It makes sense . Take me home right now . You talked to chris in rehab . He called you from the hotel . You were sleeping with chris duncan . You can 't do this . After the show , he 's out of his mind on dope . Wants to go home . To brooklyn . Your husband 's car , it 's right there . No . That didn 't happen . Jason brown . That 's his name . Look out ! The boy you killed . He was nine years old . The car knocked him 28 feet . He landed right there . Killing a kid . A secret like that , keeping it inside , it eats you up . Now , chris knew that . You gotta tell someone . If you don 't ... It kills ya . Watch out ! Who was driving ? You 're crazy . You 're gonna kill yourself . Telling someone . Letting go of the secret . I can 't . It 's the only way . Who was driving ? Get out of the street ! Who was driving ? I was ! I was driving . And two people were killed to protect your secret . Yeah ? Bob webson . Ben tucker 's driver . You write in haiku ? He 's on a methadone maintenance program . Injectable doses . Like what killed ollie and chris duncan . We 'd like to bring him in . We 're the only two women in the house . You notice that ? Hard not to . Try harder . We 're cops , not women . Our bond is our work . That 's it . Councilman 's driver ? Bob . Go ahead . Pick him up . Marquez . Look where 'd you get your shoes ? My wife killed someone ? A kid ? She says she panicked . A bad accident , a strung out rock star in the car . She told me that she was going to go back to the shelter that night . You didn 't know about the accident until now ? Uh ... In her statement , your wife says she told you the next day . I would 've reported it . She says she wanted to , you told her not to . You said you 'd " take care of it . " come on . I 've got her statement . I gotta get yours . Please . It 's my job . Please . Thanks , councilman . Her statement says chris duncan called her from rehab . I believe that . As part of his recovery program , chris told someone about the accident . A homeless guy . Ollie hardin . So , let me guess . Daphne says that she told me , and i killed ollie to protect our little secret . No , bob did . You had him shoot ollie up with methadone . Made it look like an o . D. My driver . He can barely drive . Bob was terrified of being homeless . Ben played on that fear . If the secret came out , he 'd be back on the streets . So i made bob kill ollie ? Chris duncan , too . My wife ... She 's a very sick woman . And i 've spent years pretending that she wasn 't . The sleeping around , the lies . You think chris duncan was the first ? It was her . All of it . What , you think it was bob 's idea to report the car stolen ? To kill two people ? The guy 's dumber than a box of hair . She probably didn 't even have to sleep with him more then once . No , i 'm sure it 's true . Everything she told you ... Except she did it . I didn 't say a word . I didn 't tell him anything . I stood by you . Tell him . She 's right . I think this is yours , sarge . She left it on my desk . A shopping list . No one 's gonna believe her . It 's her word against mine . Well , his , too , when bob hears what you just said . Take him away . Ok , sara . I could pick you up at work . Oh , me , too . So , we could be tired together . Exhausted . Ok . Sure , i ... You really want help , mick ? Thanks for coming . I 'm glad to be here . I want to thank my pal johnny , my buddy . Who-who are yow ? Mick . M - i-c-k . Alcoholic ? Huge . You know that . Johnny helped out ollie , and now he 's helpin ' me . You know , no one 's ever left me anything before . Johnny tells me this gitbox is worth a little dough-re-mi , but i 'd never sell it . I 'm gonna learn how to play it . Stopped drinking ' ... Gotta do somethin ' . Right ? And when i stop bein ' an alcoholic ... No . You don 't get cured . You get better . That 's what ollie always said . Mick ! Alcoholic ! One day ! All : hi , mick . Keep the change . Thanks . i blacked out . When i woke up , i was in a place for the insane . " stranger told me you put me in there . " that 's when i stopped drinking . ? my son . You deserve the truth . you all right ? Oh , boy . John , i 'm really beat . Me , too . That 's why i 'm here . The second we hit my bed , i am out . I 'm not going home with you . I can 't be with you , john . I don 't understand . That 's the problem . Neither do i . I don 't understand how i can be with someone who won 't tell me the truth . If i don 't understand something , i can 't make it work . I 'm a doctor . I need for things have to make sense . The heart attack . That 's what this is about . No , your heart . There 's something hidden in there . Something big . Some dark secret you won 't tell me . This is me . Right . John amsterdam . The man with anomalous blood and no past at all , whose father did " the best he could . " well , he could 've done a little better . He could 've taught you to be honest . He didn 't . I picked that up myself . Tell me i 'm wrong . Tell me you 're not hiding something . Tell me you were really undercover , that 's why there 's no history . If it 's true , i will believe it . I promise . That 's what i thought . You want the truth ? The truth is i 'm 400 years old . The truth is omar is my son , one of 63 children i 've fathered . John - i 've tried to be careful because i can 't stay with them . I 'm immortal , they 're not . The truth is - - stop . Just stop .

 Previously on Kings You 've been transferred to shiloh . You saved my life . We can skip all that . Besides you 're the darling today . You allowed an assault on your own soldiers . You are not my king . He 's harmless. he 's a cocker spaniel . That cocker spaniel Just got the best post in the military . I wonder how he 'd react if he knew about you ? Have you forgotten your vow ? what you do at night With your boys is a disgrace . We give up what we want when we want power . I woke you . I was up . Why do i ever leave ? I 'm happy when i 'm here . Daddy 's here . Finally ! How many tickets left in the lottery ? Only two seats remaining . By order of the queen , The first three rows for the first night Of the royal ballet and gala tonight Have been held for any citizen Wanting to attend , And clearly there are a lot of them . Any official response To reverend samuel 's condemnation of the king ? Polls show us divided on port prosperity . Not tonight we aren 't . No division nor anything else can disrupt first night . It 's strict orders from the queen . Do you have a ticket ? J-86 . Next . Pella dam is on the way To compensate for the reservoir 's loss With port prosperity . Drilling 's slowed by protest . Part of the campaign against the turnover of port prosperity . " our blood , our land . " Good slogan . Let me guess. reverend samuels . He 's spoken out against the port for peace plan In his sermon calling for- - The court is no longer interested In the opinions of the good reverend . Perry ? Deleted from the records , sir . Next petitioner . Court calls miss michelle benjamin . Petition on health care improvement , revised . Revised ? We 've seen this movie before , miss benjamin . Will there be more woeful pictures With no viable plan ? Numbers , sir. cold hard numbers . Independent auditing indicating national savings Should we incorporate early stage preventatives And avoidable losses if we don 't . Esteemed king is welcome to ignore The boon 's considered action owe him , Only he does so now at the expense Of fact , profit , and public record . Miss , you 've been learning to speak fancy . I have a fair teacher . These projections would suggest- - Your sister certainly makes her presence known , I 'll grant her that . She 's starting to sound like him . Yes.You Said he 'd be ready at I 'll employ my military escort , If i have to . And i don 't want any surprises tonight . There 's just been one . A seating change . Undersecretary charin has requested To be seated next to captain shephard . Along with a generous donation . What kind of donation ? 100,000 . He , quote , " wants to see what he 'll do next . " We asked for 10,000 for a seat by the king . Well , i see silas commands his thousands While david brings his hundred thousands . His star seems to be shining bright . Yes , well , someone should see to that And maybe consider tending his own . Oh , four o 'clock. well , then . There is such a health care plan , And i would hope that the government- - Apologies to the petitioner , but the king is Through with politics for the day . I waited a long time For peace to prevail , So the arts might have their day in shiloh . Pass law , Wage war tomorrow , if you like . Tonight he 's mine . Starting to find your rhythm , sir ? I was just a little worried I wouldn 't get out of there in time . I never thought i 'd be this excited About a ballet . About that . Unfortunately , we were one ticket short . Last minute need , One of the queen 's biggest fundraisers . We had to give away your seat . The queen appreciates it . It 's not something i did , is it ? There will be other invitations . 100 grand , not bad . I got the closed session in the boar room , But that didn 't cost anyone a dime . I 'm sorry , sir ? First night. should be fun . Oh , i 'm not going. they needed my ticket , so ... Let me guess. tomasina . Maybe a story about a last minute seat For a donor ? You 've been uninvited . My mother must have seen some advantage In not having you there and she pursued it . You didn 't honestly want to go , did you ? I was hoping to see michelle there . She 's the princess . If she wanted you there , you 'd be there . Don 't get me wrong. she 's my sister , But you can 't mind her moods . No one has that much free time . Don 't blame yourself . This is the greatest city in the world , Provided you don 't wait on my family To show it to you . Believe me . My father throws me a bone in court And thinks i 'll forget a life Of looking at me like a disappointment . You know what ? I 'll do you one better . My ticket 's gonna have to go to charity tonight . I 'm taking you out . You don 't- - you don 't need to do that . I think I do . I think you need a friend . I think you need a few friends . I think it 's lucky I ran into you . I believe you know these gentlemen . You flew my friends in from the front ? Hey , man ! What 's up ? First night . I can 't believe we 're really there . Technically , we 're not there. we 're outside . I think i saw a ballerina . I don 't see Jack . He just called to say he won 't be coming . Something about attending to his star . Sometimes your mother has a point . Thank you . I remember my first ballet . Every ruffle , every note . I thought I was watching angels And asked where their wings went . I had a dream , I hope is not too silly , To take what captured my imagination So absolutely once and bring it to you . When we have art ... We have inspiration . This is the true gift of my husband To whom this night , and my thanks , is due . You inspire all of us , sir . And so tonight , For the first time in our lifetimes , Let angels dance in Shiloh . Listen up , soldiers . You 've been recruited for a special assignment To show Shephard a good time . There are rules . Rules ? Yes , rule number one. stay within earshot . Someone messes with you , they handle it . Guys like fights ' cause guys like a lawsuits . Always fully protected. speaking of rule number two . Take these . The time comes , and it will , Use your own , unless you like being called daddy . And stay away from pins , needles , And the sharp nails of gold diggers . Ronnie makes good things happen . Often in little skirts and in little baggies . What ? whoa ! The man 's got taste. all in good time . You are partying with royalty tonight , So things are different . Physics don 't apply , and velvet ropes unhook like bra stripes . And everything comes free . We don 't pay for food. we don 't pay for drinks . We don 't approach girls . All things come to us and only the best . The fattiest tuna . I thought we saved a place for Shephard . A ballet would have bored an uncouth soldier . I was an uncouth soldier once . Sorry , sir. you have a call . I don 't . It 's the countryside , sir . There 's an emergency . Send the usual team. whatever they need . Where are we ? Relax. trust in god . Bruno . They 're all with me. very important people . I got my brother , my cousin , my reflexologist Tennis instructor- - Oh , can 't forget about my shrinks . Is that ... It 's her party. who wants to meet her ? Meet her ? I 'd nail her pregnant . Sick. say little . Meet private Matthews . He 's on furlough from the front , And no one 's offered him a drink in whole minutes . We can 't have that , now , can we ? Private . Gentlemen . That 's gotta be fun . What ? Being you . My dad has his boardroom . I have this. it 's a mystery . My parents did whatever they did long ago , And then had sex and had me , and now people care what i wear And where i go . Is it always like this ? Oh , it only gets better . If you 're even interested . I 'm not a saint . No , i 'm guessing you 're just lack for opportunity . Thing about royalty is , there 's no end To what people will do to get close to you . Like it 'll rub off and suddenly make them less obscure . Something in the way my mom set up the monarchy . They think we 're something other than human . So they give you things ? Whatever they have . The waters part and dignity crumbles . I have a room in my apartment just for that . It 's all there . The things you can do , or have , or have done to you , I can 't even begin to tell you how deep it goes . And I 've dug . But i can promise you ... if you start digging , You won 't be thinking about my sister after . Sir . How is he ? He 's not well . I had to bring him in . We 've been here before . Not like this. he 's bad , silas . He 's struggling . Specialists are on their way. whatever he needs . He needs his father . And he 's been asking for you , and he is in pain , And i just don 't know how to tell him , " no . " I don 't know if i can . A thousand times , you 've told me You 'd do anything for me . I 've never asked for a thing . I--I 'm asking now . I 'll be there . There he is . You missed the finale . That 's enough of that . Come . You made people care about ballet as much as you do , Really , was an achievement . Oh , only trying to share my passions . I thought david shephard was coming . All right . If you must know , security detail Said he went out with jack . Apparently they thought a twitty girl 's party Was a better offer . I 'm sorry . But if you are looking for a dance partner , There are plenty here . Not all heroes , but ... Let me guess . Paul Lash . You used to play with him very nicely back in the day . He manages a healthy fund now . He 's one of the city 's top financiers . We played when he was three and he used to eat my crayons . Enough . You can 't be mad at the world Just because you didn 't get your way at court . It 's your fault . What , that he didn 't grant my petition ? Well , you honestly can 't expect your father To give you everything . You know what ? You make a strong point . That laughter at my expense ? Merely appreciating the evening . But I can 't say I support what you have done . Offering away our lands ? You don 't support peace After all your words you 'd rather war ? I 'd rather an undivided nation as planned . As ... promised . Those plans , those promises , weren 't vouched safe by treaty . By action , i did that . You come to my house , drink my scotch , Criticize me ? I thought we agreed to no politics . This is beyond politics . The reverend has recently made this personal . Ma 'am , you have brought art to Shiloh and music to hearts . You have raised the level . This is why we end wars . And perhaps it 's best that I take my leave . Can 't you manage pleasantries for one night ? Not this one . We 've had a collapse at Pella . The whole timetable for the- - Absolutely not . I 'll bar the door if I have to . I 'll pitch a fit to make you wish for war . Whatever it is , You stay by my side and you handle it here . This one night , Silas . You promised . And by God , I 'm going to take it . How quickly they grow up . I wasn 't sure you 'd be here . Last minute thing. came with friends . You gotta do your thing . Yeah . See you after ? Not a good idea . Why ? No eyes on you tonight . Look , I know the drill . I 'll meet you later . I miss you . What is it ? Is it the guy you came with ? If I didn 't call you , there 's a reason . Take the hint . Time to go . Next stop. round up the kids . Jack . Gotta go , buddy . Already ? I 'm sort of okay here . You can do better . I don 't drink often enough to know what I want , But I find myself suddenly in need . Pick me something . You 're talking to me . Is that strange ? I 've been to a lot of events at ultra mansion And tried to talk to you at all of them , and ... How 'd you do ? Not well . Well , maybe today is a good day . But maybe today you want something . I never lived down being caught with a few munched crayons . I did grow up , Michelle . I read the papers and everything . And your petition crashed again . And if you 're as smart as your proposal , You figured you 'd do better If you came armed with outside funding . Well , are you willing to listen ? Not for free . Oh , so what 's a sales pitch cost these days ? Um , a dance ? Everyone gets to dance with you . I wanna see something no one else does . Ma 'am . Ah , Perry . Did you enjoy yourself ? Or were you stifling a yawn the whole time ? Be honest . Honest ? When curtain came , dare say , I cried , ma 'am . You weren 't taking notes the whole time ? The king demanded my stylus left bedside . Well . That- - Excuse me . Wedgwood is moving . Sorry to bother you , ma 'am . Just giving you the update on the king 's return . His return ? he left ? I--I 'm sorry . There was an accident at Pella . I initiated emergency protocol to unity . Was I not supposed to ? No , Hanson , you weren 't . You know my friend . Trouble comes . Trouble called . Claudia , I can always count on you . I was hoping one of yours would take care of one of mine . From the tank ? That hardly seems fair . He 's feeling a little clean . You 're an awful human being . I miss our wednesdays . Help me , and maybe we can reinstate . I know just the girl . You mean you ? I should warn you . He has a little thing for my sister . Things change . Hello. what are you drinking ? I 'm so sorry . Don 't. don 't ! Hey , puppy . It 's me . I 'm here . How 's he doing ? An entire floor of my hospital cleared And two servicemen dragging me around it . Are you going to tell me why ? You 're the most qualified specialist available . You treated him before . Wanna know about his progress And your intention for him . May i ask your relation ? He came in a few hours ago . Counts bad and fever climbing . He 's fighting infection . And given the immunosuppressant- - You run through the antibiotics ? he 's responded in the past . Look , we 've tried them all . What 's been working , isn 't . We considered a course of glycopeptides- - And the risk to the kidneys ? His system is so strained . If he 's going to make it through the night , We 're hoping to find something he can handle . Hoping ? You 'd best have a better course of action than hope . When was his last blood culture taken ? Within the hour . Seth was doing so well after his last round . He can 't stay this way . What do we do ? Well , we held off on last resorts before , Given the risks . Are you saying we 're there ? I--it 's hard . Are we there ? I-i don 't see an option . Do you--i 'm sorry. do you know the family ? - Prepare it , your treatment . - yes , sir . You 'll need a transfusion . I 'll order it from the bank . Nope , you 'll use mine . You 're certain you 're a match ? I 'll get a nurse . No , you won 't . So you 're the one who brings him ? Ma 'am . Thank you . Ma 'am . I didn 't think we 'd ever get you out on jack 's scene . You 're all michelle 's if the tabloids are to be believed . I made the mistake of believing them too . Whatever happened wasn 't your fault , trust me . I 'm an idiot for thinking i had a chance . I 've been friends with michelle Since before we knew what sex was . It 's just who she is . Ice doesn 't melt in her mouth . No one ever does . No one 's ever good enough for her . Even the ones who are . Come on . Oh , no , you don 't have to- - i mean- - Dance with me . Yep. the king 's socks . That one 's even got a hole in it . Just like us , only some are better . All right , so i 've taken you behind the curtain . The man is down from the mountain . Well , a deal 's a deal . Send me your proposal , and if it 's sound , Then my board can offer funds to match governmenrealize this , And they love this sort of thing . That 's it ? it 's that easy ? Yeah , i look forward To talking the details with you . I guess we 'll be having a lot of dinners together . Business partners and all . Th-thank you , paul . I--you may not realize this , But you just saved lives over socks . Yeah , i wouldn 't have guessed that our setup Would have a humanitarian outcome , But it 's an auspicious start . I 'm sorry . What- - what setup ? Oh , this . I thought- - Your mother ... She called me this afternoon to tell me That you wouldn 't have a date tonight- - My mother called you ? Yeah , uh , right before the ballet . Be sure to send an extra copy to mr. walker 's parents . You knew all along that david wouldn 't be here tonight . You planned it to push me into paul . If he took a night out with your brother , No one held a gun to his head ... or yours . He 's a good person . Probably the only person in this city Without an agenda . He 's not that virtuous . No one is . Are you so worried that i 'd like him ? No , i was confident that you would lose interest In him eventually , as always . Then why are you cutting him out ? Because he is taking up too much attention . Because the press writes about david ? Our whole lives are attention . We can spare some . This country only works if people look up to us . Not some boy . When i plan parties and force your father To sit still long enough so that people can see him , It isn 't because i want it . It 's because they need it . People like them . You think they need you because you choose Nice china patterns ? This country was nothing before it had a king . Stone age clans at war . It 's why i designed every inch of this monarchy as i did . The color of the flag down to , yes , the china . So they could have something larger than life To be inspired by . Decadence , kings , huge and poorless . You think i care about ballet ? They didn 't wait in line to see dancing . They came to see us . The royal family . We are the performance . I thought ... That you loved ballet . How long before we see a change ? Morning . We 'll know by morning . Think of all the evenings i wasn 't there . Mornings that i could stay through . You 're here now . You 're a pure thing found in the woods . You 're the only thing . Fever 's spiking . He 's not responding. he 's crashing . - I 'm bringing in my team . - you can 't . He 'll die if i don 't. i 'm bringing ' em in . Sir , we need to get you out of here . Your keys. now . We can take you wherever you wanna go . I go alone . Arrested for treason . So this is how it comes ? I seek counsel . Are you still a hero ? Things usually go well for me . Of late ... My plans are frustrated . I can 't lose what 's threatened tonight , And it hangs by threads , by minutes . What does he want from me ? Why does he act my enemy ? Port prosperity. is that the cost ? I 'll take it back. i 'll rescind the offer . I cannot tell you of god 's mind . He shares with me at his pleasure . And on the subject of silas , He is silent . I do right by him . This land was once a place where men of faith Feared to walk the streets and prayers came in whispers . I made it safe for men like you . So god owes you ? If not him , you . Tell me what 's the fair trade ? One offers sacrifice According to the offense . Only you can name that . Sacrifice ? Has he not moved past that yet ? Give him my best . Tell him i 've given too much . We make amends , silas . The pure. the unblemished . For our sins . He wants what i will not let him take . I will not leave this on the altar and live . Then you find another lamb . No . Not even god is that cruel . This what you need ? Something beautiful has to die to make you happy ? Jack , just talk to me . Can 't be like it was , joseph. i can 't . I don 't understand . What happened ? Stay away. but i love you- - I 'll take care of it . Watch it. hey , don 't touch me , dude . Don 't touch me , man ! Hey . You have a problem with my friend here ? No . It 's cool. you 're backing away ? The crown pimp doesn 't fight his own fights . I swing , your backup takes over . Yeah , that could- - That could be a problem for you . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , jack , jack ! Stay away from me . No . No ! no ! Come here ! Hit me ! hit me ! Hit me , man ! go ahead . Let 's go . Let 's go . Come on . Wait. jack , my friends- - They 'll be fine . Jack will take care of it . He just dug a little deeper . Mm-hmm . Is this what it 's like out every night ? This part 's new . Sir , you all right ? Any change ? What do you call it when i go to the countryside ? Your code ? We don 't have a code . You have a code when i take too long in the bathroom . We say you 're in serenity . Then serenity in It 's always midnight in the clock shop . I was starting to worry about you. worried about me ? He was in good hands . Don 't sweat your buddies . They 're sleeping it off in a hotel . Not alone . So did you have a good time ? I do my job ? I don 't know why you 're being so nice to me . We 're in the same boat . I 'm done for the night . You and claudia can have the other room . I.d. ? Now hold it up to the camera , please . Are you here freely and of your own volition ? Go ahead . Let 's go . This might not be a good idea . It 's not . It 's a very bad idea . You don 't have to worry . I don 't need anything from you . I just wanna take you In the other room and see what a real hero feels like . He didn 't fall asleep on you , did he ? He said to tell you he 's sorry . He couldn 't dig anymore . He left you ? I think the poor dope is in love And doesn 't know how to let go . He 's not like you at all . But it 's okay . You always have me . Wednesdays , saturdays . Get out . What ? All of you , get out ! I got the pictures . You still wanna leak them ? Not so virtuous after all . Daddy ? Daddy ? Yes . Daddy came . He came . No . You have to go ? What is it ? The cost . Silas ? Silas ? Silas ?

He is going to love that . We are coming . This morning it woke up . Transmitting on the 456 . It 's a transmission , a pulse , a broadcast . We are coming . You never tell me anything these days . - Dad died , that was it . - He is very handsome . You 're kidding me ? Really , though ? We are coming . It might be best if certain ... historical events were taken off the record . You never told me , I was never a part of it . CHILDREN : We are coming . - There 's a bomb inside your stomach . - We are coming . - Stop it ! - We are coming . John ! - I can survive anything . - We are coming ... back . ( CAR ALARMS BLARING ) ( GROANING ) ( GASPING MUFFLED ) ( ALARMS BLARING ) ( COUGHING AND GASPING ) ( ALARMS MUFFLED ) Whoa . Whoa , whoa , you can 't go back there , love . No , no , no , it 's too dangerous . They 're my friends , I 've got to get them out . My friends are in there ! - My friends ! - Get her to the ambulance . Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! No ! Hold her down ! Control said no survivors . ( SCREAMS ) ( PANTING ) ( SIRENS WAILING ) ( MOBILE RINGING ) - Sorry , I 've got to take this . - Work ? - After what just happened ? - Because of it . They 're okay now . Get yourselves to bed , girls , and don 't worry . Hello ? Target one 's eliminated . Two and three have escaped , but we 're in pursuit . - What went wrong ? - They got lucky , but they won 't get far . We can 't have witnesses . Call me when you 've got them . And make it quick . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Off to bed . I 've got the translations . Instructions . Specifications for something they want us to build . And we haven 't got much time to do it in . When they can communicate like this , this kind of detail , - why do the thing with the children ? - Because they can . And because they want to scare us . Who do you work for ? Who do you work for ? - The NHS ? - ( SHOUTING ) Who do you work for ? You tried to kill me . My friends , my friends could be dead , so don 't think I won 't use this . The government . I 'm working for the government . - I just follow orders , that 's all . - We 're on the same side . ( MAN GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) Why would the government want to destroy Torchwood ? Why ? I just do as I 'm told . I 'm just following orders , that 's all . ( SIREN PASSING ) ( RADIO CRACKLING ) ( SIRENS APPROACHING ) Jackson , keep the police back . You , come with me . If she 's anti-terrorist , I would not mind being uncle terrorist . Get some backup . Two escaped suspects . Ianto Jones , Gwen Cooper . Armed and dangerous . I know Gwen Cooper . She 's an ex-police officer , she 's not a terrorist . Haven 't you got tape to tie ? Fine , I 'm just saying . You 're barking up the wrong tree , that 's all . ( SIGHS ) I want their homes raided . Gwen Cooper is not a terrorist . You must know where she lives . ( SNORING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) - Get up ! Now . We got to go . - Bloody hell , Gwen . Get up , get dressed . We got to get out of here . - What 's going on like ? - Listen . Someone is trying to kill me , and if they 're after me , they 're gonna come after you . - Now , get up and get dressed . - What ? - Faster , Rhys , faster . Faster ! - All right , all right , all right . Down to the bottom , take a left . I mean , shouldn 't there be some sort of briefing first ? Like a risk assessment ? Not that Gwen 's a risk . - Rhys , car keys ? - Try the top of the fridge , I think . I 've tried on top of the bloody fridge , man . Come on , come on ! If you left the keys in the same place all the time , we wouldn 't have to go through this time and time again . Whoa , whoa , whoa , what you doing ? - Packing . - You 're not gonna have time to read . And they can trace us with that . Well , I don 't know , I 've not gone into hiding before , have I ? So , you lot are some sort of specialists from London , am I right ? I mean , I totally respect that , really I do . But sometimes , there 's no substitute for a little bit of local knowledge , and let me tell you , Gwen will be absolutely no bother . I mean , we 're not going in there all guns blazing , are we ? - How far is it ? - Two minutes . ( GUNS COCKING ) Come on , come on . ( PHONE RINGING ) Whoa ! Rhys , Rhys ! - Hello ? - Jesus Christ , Rhys ... - It 's Ianto , all right ? - For Christ 's sake , man . - Ianto , you okay ? - Yeah . - Have you heard from Jack ? - No . No , I haven 't . Sorry , hang on . Do you think he survived ? He usually does . IANTO : Who was it ? Any idea ? Well , I had a run-in with one of them . Said he was working for the government . That doesn 't make sense . How did they get close enough to plant it inside him , Ianto ? It was him and that Dr Rupesh guy . He was shot and killed at the hospital earlier tonight . It must have been then . - Oh , here . Let 's go . - Oh , take the bag , get the car ready . Um , where should we meet , Ianto ? Your phone , your phone could be bugged . Uh , right . Remember the last time we had ice cream together ? - No . - Yeah , you do . After the grand slam ? I don 't like ice cream , it gives me a headache . ( CAR HONKING ) I 've got to go . ( RHYS HONKING HORN ) Gwen ! Go ! ( TYRES SCREECHING ) Now do you believe she 's a terrorist ? She shot the wheels . What kind of terrorist shoots your wheels ? - Hmm ? - A clever one . Right . I think we made it . - Let 's go . - What ? What ? Can 't we just take a minute , just to ... Number plate recognition . They can trace us , we need to ditch it . It 's a brand new car , Gwen . It 's no good to us now , okay ? We need to keep moving . But wouldn 't it be better if we gave ourselves up ? You know , tell somebody what happened like ? When I know what 's happened , I 'll tell someone . Until then , we 're going underground . - Well , let me carry the bag . - What ? You want your trigger finger free , don 't ya ? Yeah . ( CRASHING ) ( GASPING ) We 're looking for Ianto Jones . MAN : Don 't move . Don 't move ! ( GIRLS SCREAMING ) We 're looking for Ianto Jones . You 're not going to find him in my bed , will you ? I 'm a married man . MAN ON TV : ... were being used by the government as a means of distracting attention away from matters of international concern . What ? - Keep your phones on today . - Why ? - I want to be able to speak to you . - Since when ? - Since we were possessed by the devil . - FROBISHER : I 'm serious . If they go off during a lesson , we can 't get them back till Friday . Keep them on mute . Every suspicious phone call , every mystery meeting , every time you come home late , you hide behind the Official Secrets Act . - And I put up with it . - Don 't start on this , not now . I accept it . But this is different . When it affects my kids , in my house ... - There is nothing to worry about . - I saw how scared you were last night . I know . It 's frightening to see it first-hand . But there 's no lasting damage , it 's quickly over . This isn 't a hula hoop craze . It happened to Brian and Wendy 's kids and they live in Canada . You don 't think this is over any more than I do . Just make sure they keep their phones on and don 't let them come home on their own . I 'm off now , girls . - I 'll see you . - Goodbye kisses . It must be serious . If you could get out of bed at a proper time , you 'd get plenty of kisses . Have a good day . - Dad ? - What ? - We want a pony . - We want a pony . ( CHANTING IN MONOTONE ) We want a pony . We want a pony . See ? Nothing to worry about . MAN ON TV : Latest headlines . Further reports are coming in about the explosion in Cardiff last night . No organisation has yet claimed responsibility for the explosion , which went off in the Bay area of the city . - Isn 't that where Uncle Jack lives ? - It 's a big place , Cardiff , shh . ... with only two people reported missing . Although 1 7 people ... WOMAN ON TV : Residents of Cardiff are reacting with shock and outrage . The entire Bay area has been closed off ... - Morning . - Morning . ... and witnesses say the effects of the explosion last night could be felt five miles away . No one can say for sure why this area was the site of such an unexpected attack . And the Prime Minister 's office have refused to speculate until more details are known . Fortunately , the timing of the device last night ... FROBISHER : As you know , Harkness is a difficult man to kill . Current theories suggest that his longevity is connected in some way to the Torchwood Hub , which necessitated taking out the entire operation . Well , he can 't still be alive after that . As I said , awaiting results . What about these specifications from the 456 ? I could barely understand a word of them . Nor me . But I 'm told the translations are excellent . And they 've started work . Dekker 's called in the damage control team , they 're working as fast as they can . Early reports are looking , well , let 's say promising . Can we see it ? They 'll be ready to show us work in progress by 1 600 hours . ( SIGHS ) We 're building something and we don 't even know what it is ? Can I ask , did the 456 contact any other country ? Intel 's been listening . No chatter on the wires . Seems like it 's only Britain . And how long can we keep it secret ? Given the children 's last statement , " We are coming back . " That 's what everyone seems to be asking . When were they here before ? Yes . - Well , if that 's everything ... - Sir . Sir , I just , um ... I just , um , wanted to say how grateful I am , sir . - What for ? - Well , I know that I 'm something of a middle man in these affairs but I just wanted to thank you for trusting me with the responsibility . All I 've done is put you on the front line . That 's what the front line 's for , John . First to fall . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . MAN : Come on , get the gases turned off . Bring the equipment down here , quickly . Hold on , stop . I got something . Hello ? If you can hear me , clench your hand . It 's not a body . It 's just the arm . ( MOBILE RINGING ) MAN : Come on . ( MOBILE RINGING ) This is Jack Harkness , leave a message and I 'll get back to you . It 's me . Call me , when you get a chance . CHILD : Mum , there 's no toothpaste . - Everything okay ? - Yeah . They 're expecting us , the car 's waiting . Well , come on , then . ( MOBILE RINGING ) Hello ? We thought there was a body , but we 've got an arm , a shoulder and the remains of a head . - It 's almost a waste of a body bag . - Is it Harkness ? Presumably . Take them to Ashton Down , keep them under surveillance . Sorry , sir . I couldn 't help hearing . That name , Harkness , is that Captain Jack Harkness ? From Torchwood ? Only , he was trying to contact you yesterday . I did mark it in the log . Said he could help . Not now , he can 't . Well , are you sure ? He was very insistent . He told me his team were the experts at dealing with things like the children thing . He told you that , over the phone ? - Yes . - He always was an arrogant sod . So , he can 't help ? He 's not really the expert ? That bomb in Cardiff last night , he was the one at the centre of it , and it tore him to shreds . Does that mean whoever 's behind the bomb is behind the children thing ? Like they wanted him out of the way or something ? Lois , your job . You don 't overhear phone calls , you speak when you 're spoken to , okay ? Sorry . That 's it , thank you . Thanks , mate . It 'll be from Uncle Ianto . Shh . We 're probably bugged . JOHNNY : Innocent kids , fast asleep at home . And a gang of uniformed thugs break in and point guns at their head ? It 's no wonder they 're traumatised . It 's no wonder our poor David pissed the bed . - I didn 't . - Yeah , you big baby . It 's the police state to blame . And I 'm gonna rinse the bastards for every penny they got . Oh , shut up , Johnny . ( DOOR SLAMMING ) What 's he done ? - Why 's he bringing it to our door ? - Hey , hey . We 're the only family he 's got . Put it in here . ( MOBILE RINGING ) RHYS : Come on , come on . ( RHYS SIGHING ) - No , they 've frozen mine as well . - Shit ! What now ? How are we gonna manage without money , Gwen ? We need to get to London . - London ? - Mmm-hmm . Everything 's dearer in London . That 's where all the decisions are made . Whoever wants us dead , that 's where they 'll be . Right , so where we should be is John O 'Groats ? I need to speak to people , but I haven 't got anybody 's numbers any more . So we 've got to go there , okay ? We 've got to go . These things are all linked up . Soon as we put your card in , bells start ringing somewhere . Come on . - Any change ? - No , complete waste of time . The body next door , Rupesh Patanjali . London wants to know if it 's okay to release him to the family . Zip it open . ( WITH DISGUST ) Ah ! It was a bag of bits when it came in . And I asked you to keep an eye on it . Get it out of that thing and cuff it to the wall . ( MOBILE RINGING ) Hello ? The good news is we don 't have to wait for the DNA tests . This is definitely Jack Harkness . And what 's the bad news ? His Lazarus qualities remain undiminished . Jesus Christ ! If he can survive that , what can 't he survive ? I haven 't got time to worry about this , Johnson . I 've got more important things in my in-tray . What about Cooper and Jones ? No sign of him yet . We 've had a sighting of her at a Cardiff ATM . We need that whole team out of the way by tonight . Get it done . Wait out here . Now , me , I use an electronic seal , see ? Even the driver doesn 't know the code . So no one gets in until it reaches its destination . - With this clown ... - You sure he 's going to London ? I don 't question how you defend the world against extraterrestrial infiltration , don 't you question my knowledge of the hauling industry , right ? - Sorry . - It 's a small company , Gwen . Cardiff to London , piss poor security and best of all , guaranteed food cargo . I 'm absolutely bloody starving . The smell from Tony 's is driving me crackers . There is food , I can 't fault you on that . I got the smell of bacon in my nostrils and I 'm looking at a lorry-load of raw spuds . RHYS : It mightn 't not only be spuds . There might be other things at the back . Come on , here we go . Right . Have you got your pen knife ? Rhys , you 're not eating uncooked potatoes . No , we need it to cut our way out . ( ENGINE STARTING ) What kind of snoops are you , then , dibble or dole ? - Don 't know what you 're talking about . - Ah , so you 're perverts , then ? MAN : Don 't know what you 're talking about , mate . Everyone , look , we got a couple of paedos on the estate . ( ALL SHOUTING ) Come on ! MAN : Charlie-Uniform-5 . WOMAN : We have observations in place , yes . ( SCREAMING ) He 'd have been better off staying dead . Oh , God , this is uncomfortable . Bloody torture , man . How are you , love ? My best friend 's belly had a bomb go off in it last night . Someone 's been trying to kill us ever since . I 'm travelling at 70 miles an hour on top of a bed of potatoes and I think I 'm going to be sick . Travel sick , is it ? When have you ever known me to be travel sick ? Well , when have you ever travelled like this ? On an empty stomach . ( RHYS SIGHING ) What ? What ? You know some announcements you rehearse in your head ? - Yeah . - Yeah , and this wasn 't - quite what I had in mind . - What you mean , announcements ? - Oh , God , no ? - Yes . - Oh , bloody hell , no ? - Yes . Oh , come here . Oh , my God . Oh , I don 't believe it . Hang on . The bomb , the guns , the car chase , the hiding from the law . God , what am I like , letting you do all that in your condition ? - Well , you carried my bag . - Gwen , I 'm serious . - This changes everything . - No , no , it doesn 't . We 're up the same creek and we still need a paddle . Yeah , but three of us in the boat . ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) Hey . - Oh , my God . What happened to you ? - I 'm not sure yet . I wasn 't followed . Sit down . You worked out my little code , then ? Dad didn 't break your leg on purpose , you know . He pushed me too hard . He always did . Well , you should 've held on tighter . - Seriously , how 'd you get in that state ? - A bomb . It was meant for me and the people I work with . My God , why ? - I don 't know . - What sort of civil servants are you ? Unappreciated ones . Are they okay ? The people you work with ? I don 't know . Gwen 's alive . I 've just no way of contacting her . I 'm not sure about Jack . Is he your boss ? The one Susan saw you with ? He 'll be okay . They won 't get rid of him that easy . I just need to find him . ( CHILDREN 'S CHATTER STOPS ) - If it 's a boy ... - Mmm . - Edward . - Edward ? Yeah . After the king . ( BRAKES SCREECHING ) ( LORRY HONKING ) DRIVER : Go on , out of the way ! Move , come on ! We are coming tomorrow . We are coming tomorrow . We are coming tomorrow . BRIDGET : Okay , I 'll tell him . - It 's happened again . - Shit . - What did they say ? - " We are coming tomorrow . " We are coming tomorrow . We are coming tomorrow . We are coming tomorrow . We are coming tomorrow . - We are coming tomorrow . - This has something to do with it . It must do . When they tried to blow us up , this is what we were working on . We are coming tomorrow . ( ALL GIGGLING AND CHATTERING ) - Tomorrow ? - Over and over again . - Are you sure ? - Positive . Oh , can you smell that ? ( SNIFFING ) Oh ... They 're coming ! Ah , I can smell them . They 're coming ! Tomorrow , and they 'll be here . Hey , hey , hello . - What did it feel like ? - Leave her alone . Go away ! - They said the same thing here . - Piss off , you perv . Yeah , okay , bye . It happened to David and Mica . What is it ? What is it ? I don 't know . But this is what we do . We deal with things like this . So deal with it . Stop it . - I need to find Jack . Give me that . - How will this help ? I took the number of the van they put him in . You can track any vehicle with the right computer programs . - Really ? - Yeah . Give me the car keys . Oh , Johnny 'll do his nut ! Please , we 've got no time to spare . A " thank you " would be nice . Look , I 'm sorry , I 've got to go . Thanks for all this . Be careful ! LOIS : Hold the line , please . BRIDGET : Hello , I 'll put you on hold , if that 's all right Mr Frobisher will be back in a moment . I 'll have to put you on hold . WOMAN ON TV : " We are coming tomorrow . " Repeated in total , 38 times . Hello ? I 'm sorry . It 's a bit hectic here at the moment with the children thing ... And reports from all around the world confirm that every single child said the same thing , from France to South Africa . Give me the name , and I 'll look into it and get back to you . Get my daughters on the phone . Ring the school office if you have to . Drag them out of their lessons . I want to speak to them . Then get me the Prime Minister . There 's a call waiting , sir . - Take a message . - It 's the Home Secretary . - And your wife wants you to call her . - Okay . The United Nations has yet to make a statement ... Hello , John Frobisher 's office . Can I speak to Mr Frobisher , please ? He 's not available at the moment . Can I take a message ? It 's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood . I need to see him urgently . Can you set up a meeting ? Um , I 'm not sure . - Just put me straight through , then . - He 's very busy . - Yeah . He would be . Who is this ? - Lois . Lois Habiba . What happened to Bridget Spears ? She 's on another line . - Do you know what Torchwood is , Lois ? - Yes . Then you should know that right now , you lot need us . The whole world needs us . We can help . But someone 's trying to kill us , someone who claims to be working for the government . Why would the government want to kill people who can help ? Yeah , exactly . That 's what I have to find out . That 's why I need to see him . Look , I know all this sounds mad . You have to believe me . I do . I do believe you . Hold the line , please . Call my wife , I 'm in a meeting with the PM . I 'll ring as soon as I can . - I 'm putting the school through . - Ah . - If you 're tracing this call ... - I 'm not . So you can set up a meeting , then ? Lilly , is Holly there ? They 're both all right . - You 're sure ? - Yes . The Prime Minister 's on his way . He 'll be there in 1 0 minutes . Okay , thanks . Ring ahead . Let them know we 're coming . - Right . - Simon , I 'm going back to Thames House . - Can you trust this guy ? - He 's our man in the government . If we can 't , we really are in trouble . Gwen , we really are in trouble . Yeah , we 've got to trust someone , Rhys , okay ? - Hi . I 'm Lois . - Where 's Frobisher ? - He 's not coming . - Why not ? My God , this is probably the worst mistake of my life . I 've read your files . Some of the stuff you 've done , you 're like unsung national heroes . Listen , I don 't do autographs and I don 't want to be rude . But why am I taking to you and not your boss ? Because if he knew you were here , you 'd be dead . He gave the order to have Jack Harkness killed . You sure ? I 've seen it with my own eyes . We really are in trouble . - Do you know a Captain Andrew Staines ? - No . - A Colonel Michael Sanders ? Ellen Hunt ? - No . They 're all dead . They were killed on the same day as Jack Harkness . I didn 't sign the Official Secrets Act to cover up murder . But then , I didn 't take the job to commit treason on my second day . - What am I doing here ? - You tell me , Lois . If you 're the bad guys , why doesn 't it say that on your file ? And if you 're the good guys , who am I working for ? And why do they want you dead ? Listen , this is a lot to talk about . And we 're going to arouse suspicion . And we haven 't ordered . When we went on the run , we didn 't have any money , see . And we put the last of the coins in the phone box to get through to you . So , is there any chance you could ... Thank you . Oh , great . Thanks . That 's magic . I 'll have a steak pie and chips and a cup of tea . - Yeah . - Just a latte for me . Okay . Won 't be a second . I 'll leave you to it . Thanks , we owe you one , a big one . Everyone in the office seems to think what 's happening with the kids is all to do with aliens . And that they 'll be here tomorrow . And there 's something big being built on the top floor of the MI5 building . - Okay , what do you mean " something " ? - I don 't know . But it 's like they 're getting ready . And if you lot , Torchwood , if you 're the alien experts , and they really are coming tomorrow , why does Mr Frobisher want you out of the way all of a sudden ? I 've no idea , but I 'm going to find out . Can you tell me anything about Jack Harkness or Ianto Jones ? Jones is missing . I 've been told Captain Harkness is dead . - Well , that can 't be true . - Well , that 's what I thought . I overheard Mr Frobisher say to keep him under surveillance . I mean , why do that to a dead person ? ( JACK SHOUTING ) JACK : Come on ! Who 's the genius behind the camera ? Come on , come on , take your bow . Show yourself . Face me like a man ! I 'm not a man . Who are you ? What 's all this about ? Apparently you can 't die . So it would be foolish to tell you anything . But I will say this , if I can 't kill you , I can contain you . ( SCREAMING ) JACK : Nooo ! GWEN : Do you know where they 're keeping him ? I 've got a floor plan in my bag . - Steak pie and chips twice ? - Oh , thank you . It 's a ... It 's a military compound . Are you sure ? That 's where Mr Frobisher told them to take him . - Salt ? - Thanks . This is brilliant work , Lois . Can you ... Oh . Only problem is , how do we get inside ? Well , um , Mr Frobisher 's just authorised the release of a body from Ashton Down . This is Rupesh Patanjali . They must have thought he was one of us . Well , the undertaker 's name is Richard Rossiter , and he 's got an appointment to pick him up at 5 : 30 today . And I was thinking , access to a funeral director would be easier than access to a secure military compound . So , he 'd have to pass through here sometime between 5 : 00 and 5 : 1 5 to get to Ashton Down for 5 : 30 . And there 'd be no witnesses . The name of the contact at the compound is a Corporal Camara . His number 's on there and he 'll be expecting you . Sugar ? I 'm a PA , it 's what I do . When this is all over and you want a job , come see me . ( MUFFLED MOANING ) I 'm sorry . I don 't suppose you 'd believe it , but this is all in the national interest . ( MUFFLED SHOUTING CONTINUES ) ( SHOUTING ) - Prime Minister . - We 're ready ? Let 's go . Have they sent us any further information ? Not since they sent us the designs for this thing . I 've got two radio operators working round the clock . They 're sending out continuous messages on the 456 wavelength , but we 're getting nothing back . Carry on , don 't mind me . What 's the latest from Jodrell Bank ? - Any signs of their approach ? - No , but then there wasn 't last time . What 's that for ? It 's for them . Uh , hi . Um , we 're here to pick up a body . 5 : 30 appointment to Corporal Camara . Kodak 's dead ? When did that happen ? No , he 's the contact . The name of the deceased is Patanjali . - Rupesh Patanjali . - Jesus ! Shit meself , then . He owes me money . - I 'm sorry . - I 'll have to look in the back . Kodak , got a couple of body snatchers down at the gate for you . - Over . - Okay , let them in . Over . RHYS : We 're not going to get away with this . You really shouldn 't be here , Rhys . Oh , I shouldn 't ? Hello ? If Jack needs carrying , you 're gonna need me here . See that fire exit ? Do you want to back up to that ? Save you having to wheel him round the block . Okay . CORPORAL CAMARA : So there 's an upside to this place being turned into a mortuary all of a sudden . So you don 't get many bodies , then ? Not usually . But we 've got in three at the moment . - Do I know you ? - No , I don 't think so . You don 't look like an undertaker . If more undertakers looked like you , there 'd be more of a demand for bereavement . Ooh , hang on . Just going to open the fire door for your mate . Corporal Camara , west corridor . Just opening the fire door for the body snatchers , okay ? Okay . She 's shy , isn 't she ? Just prefer the company of dead people . - She 's seeing anyone ? - She 's married . Married and pregnant . You can forget it , mate , right ? - You 're a couple , aren 't ya ? - Mmm-hmm . No offence , can 't blame a man for trying . - You wanna check this is the right one ? - Yeah . - Corporal Camara ? - Yeah ? Everything okay ? The camera 's not working . Yeah , just checking the paperwork . No problem . Come on , come on . What 's going on down there ? I 've lost two cameras now . Faster . Come on , come on . ( ALARM BLARING ) Intruders , two of , west corridor . Intruders , two of , west corridor . Move it , Rhys , out of the way . What the hell is that ? Move ! Move ! Move ! Positions ! We have to surrender . I 'd lay down your weapons if I were you . You 're as trapped and helpless as the man in the concrete cell . Put the guns down ! Okay . ( ALL CLAMOURING ) - Run , run ! - Positions , positions , come on ! Come on , get on . Ah , Ianto . You took your time . The roof 's collapsing . Come on ! - Go ! - Move it ! Take your positions . Go after them , all of you ! - They 're gonna catch up . - Rhys , get out and move that truck . Hold on tight . Move , Rhys ! Come on ! We 've got a problem . Cooper and Jones stalled us at a roadblock . How did that happen ? I 'm sorry , there 's a chopper on the way . But they 've got a head start on us now . If he talks we 're in deep , deep shit . I 'll have to call you back . RHYS : Where the hell are you taking us , Ianto ? What are we doing ? You 'll see in a moment . Get the car started . We 've only got a few minutes , come on . Come on , come on . ( GASPING ) - Told you I 'd be back . - With a little help from us . - What the hell 's going on ? - Don 't know yet . But the latest from the kids is that it 's happening tomorrow . Just in time , then . Get in the car . Come on , we 've got work to do . REPORTER : The United Nations has issued a statement asking parents ... REPORTER 2 : The question still remains why every child in the world is giving their statements in the English language . REPORTER : ... no theories as to why or how the children ... REPORTER 3 : Our focus now , is on tomorrow . With every child in the world claiming that tomorrow is the day , the world is left wondering . Mr Frobisher , sir . Seals locked and ... - release . - Sir . As per the 456 instructions . A combination of 25percent nitrosyl chloride , 22percent hydrogen chloride , 20percent nitrogen , 1 2percent fluorine , 9percent hydrogen cyanide , 6percent acetone , 6percent phosgene . In short , poison . I 'd hold onto your nose , Bridget . Though come to think of it , you 've been doing that for years . - And that 's what they breathe ? - Breathe ? Eat ? Fart ? - ( CHUCKLES ) We know nothing about them . - Excuse me . If we know the composition of that gas , can 't we work out what sort of creature could live inside it ? Could do . If we had all the time in the world . So they arrive , and then what ? The whole room 's laid out according to 456 instructions . Something of an ambassadorial suite , I 'd say . Or a throne room .

 All right , I got 50 smackers for each and every man ... willing to work an honest day at my compound . Who 's up for it ? I 'm taking rocket engineers ... radar-tracking operations managers ... super fusion fuel-rod insertion specialists ... with venturilium-handling experience ... and I 'm gonna need one or two guys ... who can do phased-plasma spectrum analysis . Any takers ? Anybody ? No ? Geez . They never learn . And they get lamer every week . Yeah , looks like Manosaurus . Better go check if he 's got any henchmen stuck further down . All right , all right ... enough about how great you 're doing ! It was a rhetorical question . What I 'm really calling about is just to , uh ... give you a heads-up . I 've got a meeting this morning with a certain 4-star general ... to discuss a certain hot business deal with a certain me . You got a meeting with Manhowers , huh ? - That 's great , Rust . - Yes , it is . Tell him I say hi , the choppers he ordered will be ready a week ahead of schedule . So , anyway ... next time you do a photo shoot for one of the science rags ... get ready to move over ... because I 'm lifting my self-imposed media blackout . Hey , you saw the super-scientific American piece , did you ? That must have been one of the gals in my P.R. Department . Hup . Hang on a sec . You have a Puerto Rican department ? Hello ? What ? Rusty ? Still here . - New phones . Hello ? - Hello , Dr. Venture ? Still me . Hadji . Give me good news , buddy . I wish that I could , Dr. Venture , but this is not so ! Hello . I can hear you . We have had some problems on the line . Come on , Raj , are you snowballing me ? You promised you 'd put on extra shifts to make the street date . A thousand pardons , Dr. Venture ! Get off ! Get off ! We are trying to work for you ! But I I have Jonny staying with me , and he is in a bad , bad way ! Car ! He 's early . Boys , inside . Doc ! Doc ! Code green ! The eagle has landed ! What am I to do ? ! My wife will leave me if I bring him to the house again ... but he is like my brother to me ! Brother ! Hold on , Raj , I forgot . I got Rusty on the other line . Rusty ? ! Has he asked you for money yet ? Hold on , Hadji . Rust , you still there ? Crap , did he hear us ? ! Places , everyone . Places ! Turn on the juice ! Uh , Dr. Venture , please . I got an appointment . And you are ? General H.I. Manhowers , United States Armed Forces . OK , now . Yes , yes , of course . $ 1 0 million will be fine . And anytime the European Space Agency needs more ... you know where to find us . Grazie , signore Ventura . Ciao . Guten Tag . Oh , hello , you must be General Manhowers ? Oh . Well , shall I give you the grand tour ? But wait . Why walk when you can ride in style ? Moving walkway . Hmm . Hold all my calls ! Venture Industries ? Dean , they can 't hear you . You don 't have to pretend that hard . They can 't ? Oh , OK . I 'm on . - Morning , dad . - Hello , son ! Say , is that where my top-secret ... experimental hover boots have gotten to ? Sorry , pop . I couldn 't resist . They 've got 1 , 001 uses around the home , at work ... or in combat situations . Boys will be boys . - Hmm . - Morning , Dr. Venture . " Hey , pop ! " " Hey , pop . " All right , what 's next ? Ah , " Future man . " Costume 's on the rack , wig 's over here ... makeup 's in the bottom tray . Line ? Line ! " Dr. Venture , quickly , the future is in peril . " " She swoons . " Dr. Venture catches her , and they kiss passionately . " Ugh . Who writes this crap ? Jeepers creepers ! What do you got there ? Oh , you like that ? It 's just a little stealth bomber ... I 've been noodling around with in my spare time . Now you 're talking . What say we get down there for a little looky-loo ? Oh , uh , well , it 's not , uh , finished yet . Maybe next visit . Though I got to wonder why you 'd put a big logo ... on a stealth plane . Um , so we can find it , of course . And now for the coup de grace- - the most highly restricted area of the Venture compound- - our Rocket Research Observation Command Center ... or Rrocc ! Uh , just- - just a sec . Uh , uh ... uh , I ... Looks like it 's seen better- - say , where is everyone ? Yeah , I gave the staff the day off . The week . Jewish holidays . What the ... Not now , not now , not now . Venture ! Face me , Dr. Venture ! Face me ... if you dare ! Uh , I 'll take care of this . Hey . Hey ! Uh , this kind of thing happen a lot ' round here ? Um , my archenemy quit ... so lately I 've got every Tom , Dick , and Skeletor ... out to make a name for himself knocking on my door . Who 's that other fella talking to him ? Oh , he 's another valued customer of mine . Aah ! Aah ! Uh , diplomat . Hell of a lot of brand loyalty from the big Indian . - Stop it ! Please ! - Come here , you little ... - Aah ! Aah ! - Come here ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Aah ! Well , since everything seems to be under control out here ... what say we head back inside and talk business ? Nah , I think I 've seen enough . Wait . Wait ! That 's not all I 've got . Look ! Zero-gravity pen ! It writes in space . You keep it , son . Truth is , you got a lot of impressive stuff here ... - ... no two ways about it . - Aah ! Aah ! A lot of it 's the same impressive stuff ... I saw back when your dad was running the show ... only it all still worked . Is this about your shoe ? Because if you wait 20 minutes , it 'll come back around . Oh , I don 't know how gum got on the walkway . Yeah , yeah , thanks for showing me around , Dr. Venture ... and for the Fruitopia . Can 't remember the last time I had one of those . And speaking of shoes ... you haven 't seen these yet- - spy shoes ! The soles flip around so that the Russians ... can 't follow your footprints ! I-I call them sneakies . Oh , stop it . It 's over . We 're not really gonna have to sell the compound , are we , pa ? I don 't know , Dean . I don 't know . Why don 't you ask Uncle J.J. for another loan ? He 's rolling in the dough . Perhaps I can be of assistance . I am Dr. Henry Killinger . And this is my résumé . " Freelance business consultant and executive motivational coach . " - I don 't know if I can afford- - - I work pro bono . Great ! When can you start ? I already have . Whoa ! You cannot hope to reverse your regrettable financial straits ... without increasing production und workflow . To do this , you will need a highly skilled ... full-time staff , und here they are . Jesus ! How did the ... Well , team building is a specialty of mine . I can 't- - they don 't look Mexican ! How am I supposed to pay all these people ? ! You won 't . The state will . These men are part of a work furlough program . I call them the Venchmen . Do you get it ? Venture ? Vench-men ? No , no , I get it . I 'm just imagining what the super-science workers union ... is gonna say when they get a load of the scabs . They 've been on strike for , like , two years . Da-a-d ! The manufacturing wing- - it 's on fire ! Aw , looks like we 're under attack again . Everybody in the panic room . I 'll take care of this . Relax , my friend . There will be no more attacks . What you see is not fire but industry breathing ... new life into the corpse of the Venture compound . I 've never seen it do that before . Me neither . Wow ! You 're some kind of magic man ! No , you are the magic man . Wow ! I suggest you put that into a high-yield mutual fund . Now , if you will excuse me , I have much work to do . Gentlemen . Esteemed representatives of the machine workers ... nuclear engineering and custodial super-science unions ... I have read your list of grievances ... and am prepared to make you a very generous offer ... on behalf of Venture Industries . Who the hell are you ? ! Killinger- - Dr. Henry Killinger . And this is my magic murder bag . Well , gentlemen , we have a deal on the table . What do you say ? Any takers ? " Notice of hostile takeover " ? Who ? Venture ? What a dick ! Wait , we 're not even a publicly traded company . Oh , uh , FYI- - I issued some shares back ... when we needed cash for the Nintendo Wii . What ? ! We 're supposed to be partners ! Why didn 't- - is this supposed to be me ? As a griffin , yeah . Well , we 're partners , ain 't we ? - Why are you a Minotaur ? - Centaur . Eviction ? ! But I 'm not in arrears ! The company is going back into arachnid research . Your quarters have been rezoned . What ? Why , Mr. Venture will hear of this ! Dr. Venture has given me power of attorney ... in all business matters . Wait . There 's something strange about you , doughy mystery man . I sense- - hmm- - the presence of- - hmm ... Hmm ... Your powers are useless on me , you silly Billy . Aah ! You have until noon tomorrow to vacate the premises . Good day . Yeah , I have just the thing to snap him out of it back at my place . I didn 't know who else to call . Thank you so much for doing this , Al . Before you thank me ... be warned- - I only have one bed . It 's a horsehair mattress , so if you guys aren 't allergic ... - ... and you don 't mind sharing ... - Ugh . I know , I know , sharing a bed ... with this guy 's like sleeping with a 1 0-speed bike . You two ? It 's not what you think . We did a lot of road gigs in the old days . Yo , beefcake ! Can we get a hand truck over here , or what ? You want me to what ? ! Now that we have repaired your business structure ... we must get to work on repairing your soul . I 'm not following you . You will never be able to reach your full potential until ... you first confront your deep-seated fear of success . Now get into the bag . What 's in it ? Only what you take with you . OK . I 'm standing in a bag . Are you ? This is- - this is my old kitchen . I remember this wallpaper . Hey ! " Remember . " Remember what ? What does this have to do with my super-science business ? Hello ? ! Hello , Rusty ! You 're up bright and early . I heard noises . Oh , um , daddy had a little sleepover . Say , uh , what ya eating there ? Alpha Dog ! I like Apple Mummy better , though . Apple Mummy . Either way , the thing is you 've got to get a good breakfast ... because breakfast is the most important meal of the day . King Nutri-man 's my favorite ... but you don 't get a prize ! Aw , what are you trying to do to me ? ! This is the moment your feelings of inadequacy ... first manifested themselves- - when your father ... turned from role model to tormentor / rival . What are you going to do about it ? ! Pop ? ! Help me , pop ! Hold tight , Rusty ! I 'll have you out of this in a jiff . No , do not call out to your father to save you . He is the one who tied you up ... und buried your dreams in this tomb . He commands these creatures of the dark- - fear , self-loathing , stinkin ' thinkin ' , und dillydallying . Free yourself and destroy this temple of failure ! Ugh ! Aah ! Rusty ? What 's all that racket ? The goliath will not stop crushing your soul ... until you slay him once und forever . Kill him ! Take your rightful place on the Venture throne ... und become the golden boy / king godhead . Lights out , son . It 's time for bed . Do it- - slay him now and forever be free ! The son has become the father ... und the floodgates of heaven have opened . Prosperity rains upon you . Mmm . Ah , but who is this tiny little man ? Why is he stealing your birthright ? Careful- - the vision was so traumatizing to your psyche ... you had a seizure . What ? ! How did I get in here ? ! Why am I naked ? Did you slip me a roof-o ? You 're naked because you 've been born again . Your old clothes , your old life no longer fit you . But I have something that will . Und I 'll be needing my wallet back also . Ah , Mr. Samson . Uh , yeah . Here , it 's a little housewarming gift . Give it here , big man . Ah ? Tch-tch-tch . Pop a squat . You 're just in time to rescue us from Mr. Goodtimes here . Er , to what do we owe this unannounced ... but welcome pleasure ? I dunno , bored , I guess . Then you 've vanquished your demonic intruder ? Excellent ! I presume you 've come to invite us back to home ? Uh , no , that new Killinger guy ... got rid of all those costumed schmoes ... who kept bugging us , so there 's just ... not a whole hell of a lot for me to do at the compound . What ? ! Not a lot to do ? ! Mr. Samson , are you not spiritually and morally outraged ... to find yourself the tenant of the devil himself ? ! Huh ? Oh , well , sure , you know , I was pissed ... when he told me I 'd have to start paying rent . Even more when he gave me a retroactive bill ... for the last two years . But he explained how I could write it all off ... so now I 'm getting way more back from the I .R .S. and I come out ahead of the game . But what of your boys ? Surely you don 't think them safe in the hands of the beast ! Gods , he 's probably shaking them as we speak ! Shaking them like a nanny possessed ! The boys ? No , no , no , no , he 's crazy about them ... and they 're crazy about him . Where 's Hank ? Dean 's really excelling in his studies ... getting great progress printouts from his learning bed ... which I got to credit to Killinger 's tutoring . Well , what did we learn ? I 'm not sure about some of the stuff he 's teaching Hank . This man stole from your father . Teach him the meaning of loyalty . But he 's got a PHD in child psychology ... so , you know , whatever . Have you not the eyes to see what he 's doing ? ! I have touched his mind ! His is the way of the serpent and the apple ! He 's seduced your employer with the poison promises ... of a Faustian covenant ... giving with one hand as he macerates your souls with the other ! We must stop him at once ! ! Oh . I 'm not sure about this . If you want to be a power player ... you need to look like one . How is the fit ? Snug , but there 's room . You 'll grow into it . Well , it 's ... different . Richard Nixon said the same thing when I gave him his first power tie . What do these things do ? This one is for your diet pills , and this is for what have you . Hmm . Hm . - I like it . - Ah . I-I 'm sorry ... I 've become the proud papa . Oh . I love mein job . - Whew ! Hey-o ! - Shh ! Ah , shit . That 's new . Intruders on the grounds . Should we call it in to the doctor ? Magic cloak of concealment ! Hurry , now . Oh , please hurry . Can 't ... keep ... it ... up ! Oh ! The universe wants you to be happy ... und have all the things you want in life . She is waiting to pour out her bounty of blessings upon you . Visualize the things you want in your mind 's eye . If they belong to someone else , take them . We will cover lethal force in the next- - Why are we putting on these getups , again ? Because he knows my face and because he 's magic . What are we , chopped liver ? We 're somewhat less magic , so we must resort to ... Mr. Samson 's plan of subterfuge and attack . Are you finished ? I 'm very excited about this plan . Ow ! I thought I gave you power of attorney ... so I wouldn 't have to be bothered with this kind of crap ! This is different . It must be in your own hand und only in blood . Well , you 've got enough of it to print a KISS comic book with . What the hell am I signing , a Zeppelin ? A most sacred pact- - membership in the most elite brotherhood ... mit exclusive arching rights . Didn 't have to go through all ... this hooey to get my first archenemy , but what the hey ? Did you pick me a good one ? No . You did . What ? ! My brother ? ! Bingo . Isn 't it perfect ? It 's a classic Cain und Abel story . Well- - but- - but he can 't arch me . He 's not even a super- - Oh , my god . This is- - but I 'm not a ... Aren 't you ? Is this not what your heart was trying to tell you ... in your visions ? Sign it ! Make your blood feud official ! Act now ! Venchmen are standing by for your order ! Ready , Dr. O ? On 3 . 1 ... 2 ... Uh , gee , would you- - oh ! Would you ... Ugh ! The fiend ! It 's as if he 's cast a spell of binding on the machine ! OK , OK , plan " B. " Al , take the door . I swear , this has never happened to me before . Oh , does nothing work in this place ? ! We 're too late ! Venchmen ! Aah ! This is it . Excuse me . Excuse me , pardon me . - Excuse me . - Excuse me . Thanks for this opportunity . - Thank you . - Excuse me . Hey , nice working with you , man . Doc , you OK ? I-I don 't know . I- - he- - he thinks I 'm a- - Brock , am I a ... bad person ? What the hell just happened ? Am I , Brock ? ! Uh ... Where is the one called Killinger ? ! Uh , he- - he left . Uncle Henry 's gone ? No ! But we saw you sign ... His severance agreement . I didn 't sign the- - the other thing . So he thanked me for my time ... wished me luck , and then just flew out the window . With your pants ? Is that the severance package ? That sucks . Well , did he at least leave a note ? ! He 's supposed to take me rock climbing tomorrow ! Oh , hell , I 'll take you , Aqualad . Hold me , Brock ? Uh , no . Please ? I feel so empty . What ? You guys said you wanted to help ... " Not with a stolen dick . " " All the world 's a stage ... " und all the men and women merely players . " They have their exits and their entrances ... " und one man in his time plays many parts ... " his acts being seven ages . " Ha ha ! You said it , killer ! And you can read more about it in the Bible . Bill , bill , bill , final notice . Hmm . Ugh ! Oh ! June 6 , 2003 ? !

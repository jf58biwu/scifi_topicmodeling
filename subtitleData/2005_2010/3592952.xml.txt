 - previously on heroes : - we have a problem with sylar . He 's gone . - nathan . what are you- - Hey . - i think i 'm in trouble , pete . - ever think that we can just live , noah , Out in the open ? - no . - i 'm a friend , tracy . - what is this place ? - home . please take this . To find your way back here . - i pushed nathan 's memories into your mind . I made your body think that it was him . - i 've gotta go find nathan . Get my body back . Then i kill every single person even remotely involved . - police , freeze . - what the hell are you doing ? - i 'm crossing that line . - you idiot , you 'll die with me . - i know . - [ grunts ] - gun . [ police siren blaring ] - where is charlie ? - i 'm the only one ... Who knows exactly where your sweet charlie is . And you can save her , But only if you do exactly what i ask you to do . I made a mistake about eight weeks ago . - [ grunts ] This green earth has given us so much . Feels good to give back what we can . - then why don 't you give back charlie ? You 're an evil man , butterfly man . You must release charlie From wherever you 're holding her . - i have a way for you to earn her freedom . I met a man eight weeks ago . He had something i wanted ... A film from 1961 . His name was mohinder suresh . - i know dr. suresh . I don 't need to time travel . i can find him right now . - dr. suresh is dead . - you killed dr. suresh . - i need you to go back eight weeks , hiro , To a motel room in texas . - to save his life ? - no , to save that film Before he destroyed it . Once you return , deliver it to me , Your sweet charlie will be set free . - i don 't know if i can even time travel anymore . - then you 're gonna have to try very , very hard . Your sweet charlie 's life depends on it . - samuel . - yeah . - we 're done here . - let 's go . [ grunts ] - so india was connected to australia ? - mm-hmm . As well as madagascar and most of southern africa . Now together , they made a supercontinent Called pangaea . That is until india broke off and began to migrate north . - everything keeps changing , doesn 't it ? - indeed . Come on . One of the great lessons of plate tectonics Is that all things are subject to evolution , Even the earth beneath our feet . Remember to read chapter six before class . - thank you , dr. suresh . - your students adore you , mohinder . Teaching is what you were born to do . - it does feel good to be back in the classroom again . Listen , i was thinking of making lamb biryani For dinner tonight . - you promised you were going to throw this away . - i am . - it was delivered over a month ago . I assumed you meant immediately . - look , it 's all of my father 's work From coyote sands in the ' 60s . And i didn 't mean to lie to you . It 's just hard to let go . - we have a good life , mohinder . A good , simple life here . Every time you dig into your father 's research , You disappear into a rabbit hole . It only leads you to a dark place . - perhaps you 're right . - you doing okay ? You 've been sitting here staring at that poster For two hours . - you ever wonder what it would be like Running off and joining a carnival ? - oh , yeah . that 'd be a dream come true . Living with a bunch of fire-breathing freaks . - just because they 're different doesn 't make them freaks . - well seriously , Can you imagine spending your life in some trailer Moving from town to town ? - and you spend your life where , in some crappy diner ? I 'm sorry . - are you sure you 're okay ? - yeah. i 'm great . I 'm fantastic . - oh , my god . - i 'm sorry . - if something 's going on , we 'll figure it out . - hey , it 's not like i lost my car keys . I lost a week of my life . - yeah , and you woke up in a carnival . You sure you wanna remember that ? - yeah . - senator petrelli , welcome back . - it 's good to be back . Elizabeth , do me a favor . Will you get my schedule out of the front office , please ? - sure . - that was awfully casual . - yeah . I 'm telling you , pete . it doesn 't make any sense . - what 's that ? - even if my lost weekend was just some crazy bender Under the big top , A senator going off the grid . That ought to raise one or two alarms , Don 't you think ? Mom say anything when you talked to her ? - she 's in washington , wants to meet us here . What are you thinking ? Talk to me . - i thought i had a handle on this , pete . But these last few weeks , it 's just been like I don 't know who i am anymore . - just the last guy i figured for an identity crisis , nathan . - [ exhales sharply ] [ knocking on door ] - senator ? - go ahead . - the good news is your day 's wide open . We cleared your calendar when you went on vacation . - vacation ? - sir , your mother said you weren 't sure How long you 'd be gone , so ... - my mother . Right . Thank you . - deja vu . - oh ! so sorry , you startled me . Uh , can i help you ? - rene ? - it 's okay . - did my mother send you ? - don 't come any closer . I 've come here to speak with peter . - okay . It 's okay. come on . - what are you doing here ? - i came to warn you , peter . You need to know the truth . - freeze ! - claire. claire . It 's me , tracy strauss . - and you are breaking and entering In my dad 's apartment because ? - i really need to see him . - [ sighs ] Yeah , well , that 's why god invented doorbells . I didn 't mean to . I put my hand on the doorknob and it just ... Look , do you know where he is ? Something is going wrong with my power . I can 't control it . I didn 't know where else to go . - tracy , you 're freezing . - so this was my mother 's idea to clean up nathan 's mess . She sends you to wipe out our memories . - it 's what she wants me to do , But i cannot do it . - okay , and why is that ? - your mother is blinded by her emotions . There are some lines that should never be crossed . - why do you keep looking at him ? - it is not up to me to reveal this thing . The decision must be yours . The answer you seek is here . If you go , peter , Go alone . What you discover may be more terrible than you can bear . - this is dr. chandra suresh . And this is entry number four , Coyote sands relocation center , march 5 , 1961 . I 've been trying to alert the authorities here To the potential danger of gathering so many persons With abilities in one location . My concern centers around an apparent force- - Small , but measurable- - That emanates from all such individuals . When two or more of these forces are proximate , They amplify , exponentially , Like a kind of gravity or magnetism . An abnormal spike in seismic activity as of late Appears to be emanating from one of the individuals Being held here . A pregnant woman by the name of- - [ violent tremors ] This is entry number 21 . It is my intention to document the birth of the child . There has been an enormous release Of seismic activity throughout the day . - doctor , he 's crowning ! I fear that this child may indeed- - [ tremors resume ] i 'm coming ! it 's okay ! It 's okay . [ baby crying ] It 's okay , don 't worry . nurse ! - [ shivering ] - you okay ? - [ shivering slows down ] That 's better . Why is this happening to me ? [ teapot whistling ] - i thought it would be a good idea To make you some tea . You sure you 're okay ? - thanks , claire . [ whistling continues ] - [ sighs ] - what happened ? - the water started to freeze . It is happening over and over again , And i can 't stop it . - tracy , just calm down . Try to take a deep breath . Oh , no . - claire . Can you hear me ? Oh , my god . - 106 . - i really thought we were done With this cloak and dagger stuff . I still can 't figure out why the haitian Didn 't want me in the loop . - well , does it matter now ? - this just gets better and better . [ metal bangs ] - check it out . - yeah . - are we good ? - good . - what do you got ? - it 's a body . - what is it ? - it 's me . - that 's not you . could be , uh ... A shape-shifter or something , it 's not- there 's got to be a reason The haitian wanted you to see this . - this is just weird . - don 't- - - sorry . - you 're now nathan petrelli . - what did you see ? - bits and pieces of things . a hotel room . Sylar . - sylar , that 's old news . that guy 's been dead for weeks . - i know. i know . I heard ... parkman . - matt ? - his voice , he was angry . Whatever 's going on , we 're not gonna get Any straight answers out of mom or the haitian . - okay , so we gotta find matt . - where is he ? - l.a. - let 's go find him . - you sure ? - i 'm not sure of anything . - i gotta get you in the bath . Gotta get you in . [ screams ] [ crying ] - tracy . - [ gasps ] - no , i heal . i heal . It 's , like , what i do . [ chuckles sheepishly ] Okay ? [ both laughing ] - you think you ever really know somebody ? - god , are you hearing yourself ? - yeah . - okay , you know what i see when i look at all this ? I see the big brother that would let me win by a nose When we would race . I see the naval officer who would rearrange his leave So that i could have a good birthday . And the past couple years , I 've seen the guy that 's saved my ass More than a few times . - i made a lot of mistakes . - so have i . Don 't beat yourself up over it . - senator petrelli . - yeah . - i found something . I just hope this isn 't The matt parkman you 're looking for . He 's in a hospital in texas under guard . They 're saying he tried to commit suicide by cop . - thank you , elizabeth . Multiple gunshot wounds . - yeah . - he 's in critical condition . - you know , nathan , i can heal people now . If we could get in , i think i can save him . - hiro . tick tock , tick tock . - i 'm trying . - you can do this , hiro . i have faith in you . - mohinder ? - mira . I 've made a remarkable discovery . There 's a power , an actual quantifiable force- you promised me , mohinder . - no , mira , this is important . Using my father 's equations , i built a device , A sort of compass that i can use to- will you listen to yourself ? You 're possessed again by these voices in your head . - mira , you don 't understand . By following this compass- - If the child on that film is still alive And surrounds himself with a large enough number Of specials , he can become the most pow- stop . I 'm begging you , mohinder . Please think very carefully about what you have , About what you have to lose . I love you . But if you disappear again , I will not wait for you to return . - can you help him ? - i can try . - [ gasping ] - matt . You 're okay . - [ coughing ] - you 're okay . it 's me , peter . - what happened ? - you 're okay . - good things do come to those who wait . - son of a bitch , get out of my head . You 're in the hospital , i brought you back . - no , you don 't understand . This is exactly what he wants . - what 's he talking about ? - bring him closer , parkman . One touch is all i need . Then you can have your miserable life back . I can have my body back . - shut up ! you guys , run . Get away from me before he comes back . - before who comes back ? - sylar . - sylar 's dead , matt . - no , he 's in my head . He 's trying to con- - control my mind . I know this sounds crazy , but if he controls me , If he gets my power , he 's gonna jump back into his body . - whoa , whoa , whoa . slow down , matt . What do you mean , " his body " ? - this should be good . - nathan , you 're- - you 're dead . Sylar murdered you , he cut your throat . I used my power to purge his mind from his body And put your thoughts in . - you 're weakening , parkman . - i 'm not gonna let you do this . - i don 't have time for all the five stages of grief . Let 's go right from denial to acceptance . - [ grunting ] [ gagging ] Oh , my- - oh , my god , you son of a bitch . - nathan . It 's true . - no , no , no . - i 'm so sorry . - stay back . - you 're saying i 'm sylar ? - yes . But i can make it all right . All you need to do is take my hand . - all you need to do is take my hand . - don 't. don 't take his hand . - it all makes sense , pete . - nathan , get away from him . - stop ! - it all adds up . These new powers aren 't mine . - stop . - they 're sylar 's . I don 't exist . - doesn 't make sense . I don 't buy that . - take my hand , nathan . - he 's controlling you ! - take my hand now . - no ! no ! - do it , take my hand . - i 'll kill you first . Nathan , no ! - it 's okay , pete . matt 's right . It 's time to end it . - one touch , nathan . and it 's over . - no , don 't touch him . You touch him , he 's got my power . His mind 'll go back into his body . Stop. stop ! - you . back away from the prisoner . - take my hand , do it now . - i said , get away . - back away ! No ! no . Nathan , where is he ? Nathan , where is he ? - pete , come here . We gotta get out of here . - no ! nathan ! Nathan , is he in you ? You son of a bitch , is he in you ? - they 're in here ! - can i help you with something ? - i hope so . I 'm looking for someone who may or may not even exist . If he does , his name would be samuel sullivan . - i 'm joseph sullivan , proprietor . The man you are looking for is my brother . Come with me . - if my evidence is correct , Your brother may be capable of magnifying his powers Simply by being near others with abilities . - powers , abilities . I 'd like to help you , doctor . But i 'm afraid i have no idea what you 're talking about . I thought you were going to build a fire . - figured , uh , edgar and damian could handle that . I 'm samuel . - samuel sullivan ? - dr. suresh here has a few questions for me . He 's writing a book on the life of traveling carnies . - people wanna read a thing like that ? - it 's a colorful and exotic world . - why don 't you join the others at the fire pit . I 'm sure they could use your help . - yeah , of course . - i 've just traveled 8,000 miles To speak with your brother . If you 're gonna try and stop me , You 'd better have a damn good reason . - please. come inside . - [ catching breath ] Oh , uh , when you came in the room , I was already dead . You don 't remember seeing anyone else in that room . You took me to the morgue . And that 's all you remember . Oh , and do me a favor . take off all your clothes . - oh , let me give you my clothes . - yeah , good idea . Hurry up , let 's go , let 's go . come on . - [ grunts ] Why are we here , nathan ? - i shouldn 't be around people right now . Something happened to me out there , pete . - what ? - i nearly put you through a wall With a flick of my hand . If sylar gets into my head The way he got into parkman 's ... I can 't risk that with you . There 's a road around here somewhere . You 'll find your way home . What are you doing ? - what are you doing ? Go ahead . i 'll be right behind you . - the images on that film leave little doubt . The destruction your brother is capable of cannot be- i am well aware of what he 's capable of . But samuel himself has no idea . And it 's been my life 's work to keep it that way , To keep him in the dark about the true nature Of his power . Soon after our release from internment at coyote sands , My mother told me the truth about samuel . You saw it on film . My mother lived it . She knew exactly how dangerous he could become . I 've kept our community small in number To ensure samuel 's power remains subdued . I love my brother . But he 's become a man of great ambition . Somewhere inside , he can taste it , The immense potential he was born with . - under the right circumstances , Your brother 's powers could increase a thousand-fold . The information on that film- burn the film ! Go back to india . We must do everything possible To keep this genie in a bottle . - how do i know i can trust you ? - i have watched over him for 40 years , And everything 's been just fine . You 're no longer welcome here . [ door slams ] - mira , it 's me . You were right . This was all a mistake . I should have left that film in the trash . I should have left that box unopened . I miss you . I 'll be on the next plane home . - be careful , dr. suresh . Evil butterfly man will be coming for you . - you know , you have not lost control Of your abilities in over an hour . Whatever 's happening with you , I don 't think it 's physical . - it 's psychological . Great . I panic attack with powers . - [ laughs ] When did it start ? - just this morning . I was sitting in this diner thinking about ... - about what ? - about changing everything . My entire life . I 've been so lost , claire . I tried so hard to put my old life back together , But once i did , nothing fit anymore . Then i met this strange man named samuel . He lives with a group of people- who all have abilities . Yeah , i met him too . - he invited me to join them , To move to this place where we 're all accepted . I think i might do it . Give up everything . Just start a new life . - maybe you should . Maybe that 's what your body is telling you it wants . - it 's great to have someone to talk to about all this . It 's hard to find a friend out there in the normal world . Someone you can trust . - yeah . i had something like that , But i 'm pretty sure that 's over . Oh , it just sounded so good on paper , College . Now i 'm starting to wonder if- it 's hard out there For girls like us . [ door creaking open ] - ladies . How was your day ? - oh , you know . Same old same old . - [ exhales forcefully ] I need to know what was on that film . It 's about my ability , isn 't it ? A way for me to increase my power a thousand-fold . [ chuckles ] tell me ! - your brother warned me about you . - after all these years , he 's been betraying me ? Holding me back so that he could keep Playing the king . This is your last chance . Tell me what 's on that film . - never . - i will learn the truth . - and i will do everything i can to stop you . - i 'm sorry . - [ gasping , coughing ] Hiro ? - hello , old friend . - i am not the hiro nakamura you know . I have come eight weeks from the future . - to save my life ? - no . To save this film . In the future i come from , you were dead . - i was murdered right here in this room . How did you know i would need that kevlar vest ? - my time travel is not so good lately . The first time i tried , i arrived ten minutes from now . Wasn 't pretty . - if i hadn 't gone right to samuel , He would have never known the secrets of his power . My investigation has corrupted him . We have to stop him , hiro . - and we will . But first , you have to disappear For eight more weeks until he releases charlie . - charlie ? - yes . Samuel is holding captive the woman i love Until i deliver this film . - hiro , this man is extremely dangerous . I can 't just go away for eight weeks While he consolidates his power . - please . If he knew i spared your life , He will never release charlie . - i understand your concern , And i appreciate all that you 've done for me . But our primary focus must be stopping samuel . - i will not risk charlie 's life . - well then , we 'll have to agree to disagree , hiro . - if you will not disappear until charlie is safe , Then i will have to make you disappear . - what do you mean ? - sorry . - he used to say , " put your finger " in a bucket of water , pull it out , And see how fast that hole fills up . " [ laughter ] Thanks a lot . thanks a lot . [ chuckles ] - your have your film . Now i want charlie . - soon . Sorry your friend had to die . - mr. ahmadi , Time for your medication . - my name is mohinder suresh . My name is mohinder- yes . - janice , honey , it 's me . Look , this is tough to explain into a machine . Remember i told you there was a guy inside my head Taking control of my mind , a monster named sylar ? Well , i just want to let you know The craziness over the last few weeks is finally over . And , uh , sylar 's gone . He 's gone back into his own body . I think he got what he wanted . - i 'm not really sure what i 'm doing here . Not even sure i hope to find a- - I just know that i can 't go on living my old life anymore . - i 'm glad you called , tracy . I 'd hoped you would . I felt a real connection between us . There 's something i 'm gonna ask of you . A way for you to use your gifts To help make this a better world for all people Of abilities . Together , we can accomplish great things . You have unique talents , tracy . - nathan , this , uh , This idea , this thought that you 're- sylar . - yeah . - change the voice , chance the face , Still him underneath . These hands have killed dozens of people , pete . Friends of ours . Whoever nathan petrelli was , he 's gone now . Just some random thoughts in a mass murderer 's head . - okay , look , assuming that i believe any of that , What would it matter ? I mean , didn 't matt say that he forced sylar out ? - you really think matt could purge Every sick thought from that head ? To the rest of the world , i 'm nathan petrelli , pete . But every time you look at me , The way you 're looking at me right now , You 're gonna see sylar . Tell me i 'm wrong . Tell me i 'm wrong , pete .

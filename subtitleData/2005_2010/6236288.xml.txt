 RUSH : Destiny . The design is clearly Ancient . Launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . SCOTT : Where the hell are we ? Several billion light years from home . We are on a ship , but we have no idea where we are in relation to Earth . RUSH : This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the stargate itself . YOUNG : These are the wrong people in the wrong place . SCOTT : I 've got a lot of wounded . We need to get home . RUSH : We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial Earth . Yeah , I read about these Chinese miners that survived a cave-in for six days by drinking their urine . I 'm gonna go ahead and pretend I didn 't hear that . Yeah . You know what they ate ? Coal . - Coal ? - Yeah . This is a true story . I mean , don 't get me wrong , it was pretty stupid . Almost killed them . Water level 's down again . You 're sure nobody went near that compartment on your watch ? Spencer came by and asked if he could have a look in the tank . Why ? He 's a crazy person . Sir . Anyway , I said no . Nobody goes in there without my authorization . GREER : Sir . Maybe it evaporated when we went through the star . RUSH : It 's a closed system . YOUNG : You know , all that water went somewhere . We 're down to half of what we had when we got here . RUSH : I don 't understand this . You 're the one trying to get the recycling system up and running . - Maybe there 's a leak somewhere . - Ship says it 's fine . - If what you 're saying is accurate ... - It is . - Then we 've got a serious problem . - Well , we wouldn 't if you did what I asked you to do in the first place . Oh , please , can we stick to one problem at a time ? Running out of water wouldn 't matter - if we just dial Earth , go home ... - I already explained that to you . The ship 's recharged . The power reserves are full . - That 's the point . They 're not ! - Well , where are we at , then , Rush ? Probably about less than 40 % of original design capacity . You think I can 't tell when someone just pulls a number out of his ass ? What ? I actually pulled that number out of my ass . He 's not making it up . Look , if Destiny was ever capable of dialing back to Earth , it was thousands of years ago , when the Ancients originally intended to come here , but not now . Well , then , you 're right . We have a problem . - Yes . - YOUNG : Again . - Okay , Eli ... - Get Brody in on this . He 's an engineer . I need to borrow Eli . - 40 , 000 liters ? - FRANKLIN : That 's what I heard . But we didn 't drink it . Let 's just say it wouldn 't surprise me if there was more water than they 're telling us . - So , what , they 're hoarding it ? - It 's a big ship . You know the military . Long as they control the water supply , they control us . That 's right . I 'm talking about you . Those two are harmless . Keep it up . I need to know who I can trust . - I feel like a spy . - Eli . - Clean this room up . - Right . - What is it ? - Nothing , sir . Just had a strange feeling . - Well , we just dropped out of FTL . - Wasn 't that . I 'm on my way to the Gate Room . There 's a planet in range . Come on . What have we got ? There 's only one planet in range . The ship 's already dialed it up . RUSH : We 're getting readings now . Whoa ! Looks like we entered the " Hoth system " . Empire Strikes Back . The second Star Wars movie . Okay , I refuse to call it Episode V. - Minus 47 degrees Celsius . - Bundle up . Is that water ice ? Yes , but the atmosphere is dangerously thin . And poisonous . 0.13 % molecular oxygen , 95 % carbon dioxide , with a hint of argon . GREER : Ooh ! Nasty planet . RUSH : The only candidate within range . We 're gonna have to use the spacesuits we found , but if that brings back a half a ton of ice , I 'll take it . Shut it down for now . Lieutenant Scott , come in , please . Scott ? JAMES : There a reason your radio 's off ? Come in . Colonel Young is looking for you . - I think I 'd better ... - Go , go . What , you couldn 't find a broom closet ? We 're still working on the other suits . We 're close to having a third one ready . - How close ? - A day , maybe . We 'll be back in FTL by then . Well , they 're not in great shape . All these years , there 's bound to be degradation . Well , keep at it , we 're gonna need them . Looks like it 's just you and me , then . I could take Kennair , sir . - She 's done EVAs before , and you 're ... - I 'm fine . How are we going to cut the ice ? Plasma cutter . Should cut through the ice like butter . Just don 't get the business end anywhere near you . Suit radios are voice-activated between you . Press here if you want to tie into the ship 's communication systems . T.J. , you 're in command while we 're gone . - Is everybody clear on that ? - Oh , I 'm sure we 'll manage . Riley , start dialing . Assuming a fair amount of physical activity , you have just over eight hours of air . That 's , what , 11 hours until the next jump to FTL , right ? Don 't worry . You 'll run out of air long before we leave you behind . Thanks . Beautiful , huh ? One deep breath and you 're dead . Destiny , this is Young . Come in . Yes , sir , we hear you five by five . YOUNG : I 've just tested the ice by the stargate . I read concentrations of ammonia and several other toxic chemicals . Now , how high are the readings ? Off the charts . Well , you could try looking farther afield . YOUNG : Maybe on the other side of that lake . SCOTT : Is that really a good idea , sir ? The further away from the gate we go , the less ice we can bring back . Oh ! I 've got just the thing . Give me two minutes . Colonel , give us five . Eli has an idea . Maybe there 's fresh water in the lake under the ice . At minus 47 , the ice will be 10 feet deep . We 're better off finding a pressure ridge , something we can mine . Sounds like you 've done something like this before . Oh , yeah . A million times . - Did you feel that ? - It 's just a tremor . Hey , you know , the last planet I was on exploded . Destiny , this is Young . We 're burning through suit air . What 's going on with this bright idea ? GREER : Here we come , people ! Here we come ! Sorry , it 's impossible to steer by remote . That 's fantastic , Eli . What made you come up with that ? Actually , it represents my most recent attempt to fly , but it should carry a ton of ice . PARK : Colonel , we 're sending through Eli 's latest invention . I love it ! The man gets a gold star . SCOTT : How much will it hold ? Definitely more than you can carry by yourself . YOUNG : All right , we 're heading out . Keep the gate active . We 'll radio back when we find something . - T.J. - Sir ? - YOUNG : Listen , if we don 't make it back ... - You will . Well , we 're two guys in million-year-old spacesuits walking around alone on an ice planet . If we don 't make it back , you 're gonna do fine . Yes , sir . Good luck . - The level 's dropped . - Again ? Nobody 's been in or out . Well , Brody said there 's no leak in the system , so that leaves one alternative . - Who could steal that much ? - That 's a lot of water . Yeah , I know , but I don 't know what else to do . Besides , it wouldn 't hurt to know where we stand . Start a search . Let 's go , Gorman . Dial it up again , Mr. Riley . We must maintain communication . It just went off a second ago . Your timing is perfect ! Because it 's been 38 minutes , the maximum time a stargate can remain open . Well , see , I didn 't know that . Colonel Young , it 's Dr. Rush . What 's your status ? We 've found an exposed area of ice that looks promising . - Testing now . - SCOTT : We 're pretty far out . - Can 't see the gate anymore . - It 's still worthless . RUSH : Keep looking . GREER : Lieutenant Johansen . - Go ahead . - GREER : I found something . - So did I. Can it wait ? - GREER : It 's Spencer . I can deal with him myself if you 'd like , but ... No , it 's fine . I 'll be on my way . - I didn 't steal anything ! - Yeah ? - What 's this , huh ? - SPENCER : Those are mine ! I brought them through with me when we evacuated ! You brought them through with you , huh ? - Give me a reason . Come on . Come on . - Hey , hey , hey ! Back off ! I don 't have time for this . Lock him up somewhere . Colonel can deal with him when he gets back . You said you found something . To be honest , I don 't know what I saw . I have to talk to Rush . You keep searching . Nothing we find is gonna add up to what 's missing . I know , but we have to know what we 've got . No one 's gone near the tank , and it keeps going down . Come on , come on . Destiny , this is Young . We got pure ice . That 's excellent news . It 's a frozen waterfall . We should be able to break it up into manageable pieces and haul it back . We 'll be ready for you . - Busy day on Destiny . - I haven 't taken anything . - I don 't think you have . - What are you doing ? - Checking for stolen rations . - It 's okay , Dr. Franklin . Confess , Miss Armstrong . You drank 40 , 000 liters of water . - He 's kidding . - I know . I 'm just saying we have rights . I 'm done here , Miss Armstrong . I hope I haven 't inconvenienced you . - I understand . - I knew that you would . You . Next . This is never going to be enough . Stand back . SCOTT : You 've done this before , too , have you ? - YOUNG : At least five times . - You mind if I give it a shot ? Remember , all we have are the bullets we brought with us . So , are we talking about , like , one little cloud of bugs or are they all over the ship ? I 'm not even sure that " bugs " is the right word for them . Huh ! What about " cloud " ? Except the cloud was alive . It was almost like thousands of tiny alien creatures . Yeah , I have a problem with everything you just said . What you 've just described is ... Well , it 's the same as Lieutenant Scott claimed he saw on the desert planet . That 's what I was thinking , and maybe some of them followed him back here . Wouldn 't we have noticed them ? No , not if only a few came through the gate . They 're like tiny grains of sand . And then what , started reproducing ? Well , if it 's a living organism , then , yeah , they would . Okay , so now we 've got aliens . What if they start bursting out of our stomachs ? I don 't think they 're dangerous . It almost felt like they were trying to communicate . Lieutenant Scott used the same word . Yeah , at the time , you said he was delirious . Well , I was wrong . What do you intend to do ? Well , I guess we should stop everyone from wandering around the ship . After you . - Here ? - Yeah , yeah . This is Lieutenant Johansen . We have a situation . It 's under control , but as a precaution , I ask everyone to return to their quarters and remain there until further notice . Thank you . You 're ... You 're not going to tell them ? - That we 've got aliens ? - No , we 'll keep it on a need-to-know basis . - What else ? - You 're in charge . And I 'm asking your advice . What else ? Always consider the greater good . That 's it . That 's enough ice for now . Let 's get out of here . GREER : Gorman , meet me in the Gate Room . We have ice on the way . Copy . MAN : They 're on it . Dial it back , please . Destiny , this is Young . How 's it going up there ? - Offloading the sled now . - YOUNG : Well , hurry it up . We want to do one more run . Just so you know , another matter has come up . - We have it under control . - We have aliens on the ship . - YOUNG : What ? - They just shredded Gorman . What the hell does that mean ? Millions of tiny flying razor blades floating around the ship like piranha . Corporal Gorman is alive . Lieutenant Johansen is tending to him now . - He 's probably not going to make it . - Eli ! YOUNG : That 's it . We 're coming back . No , no , no , that 's not necessary , Colonel . Eli is overreacting . We believe the creatures are the same as those Lieutenant Scott encountered on the desert planet . They must have followed us back through the gate . SCOTT : No , I doubt those things I saw were dangerous , sir . They helped me . RUSH : Corporal Gorman may have provoked them . We 'll know more once he comes to . - If he comes to . - In the meantime , Lieutenant Johansen has ordered everyone to remain in their quarters . They 're nothing more than a nuisance at this point , Colonel , but we desperately need more ice . YOUNG : All right . We 'll figure out what to do with them when we get back . Okay , sending the sled back through now . Rush out . MAN : Yeah , those are on the way . I just sent it through , sir . You 're gonna have to learn when to shut up . You can 't just ... You can 't just lie to the guy and expect me to ... Once back into FTL , it could be days before we find another planet capable of replenishing our water supplies . This ice represents a fraction of what we need to stay alive . - We need more ! - Yeah , I know ! - But that doesn 't mean that you can ... - Yes , it does ! - You 're making it sound like we 're ... - Just stop acting like a child , please ! RUSH : We have to figure this out . I said " we . " I say we torch them . You know , put some teams together , hunt them down . - Where 'd you get that ? - I can invent things , too . Hey , we 've really got to work together on this project ... You know , maybe the bugs were just responding out of self-defense . Self-defense ? Did you see what they did to Gorman 's face ? Yeah , I 'm the one treating him , Sergeant . I saw exactly what they did to his face . Look , we don 't know what it is we 're dealing with , and torching them may only serve to antagonize them further . - We hit them with something else . - Revenge , that 's great . We gotta do something . If we just sit around till they drink all of our water then we 're gonna ... Alien bugs show up and half our water disappears . Don 't tell me I 'm the only one who made this connection . Well , obviously not . The question is , what are we going to do about it ? Okay , Sergeant , you and your team go search for this alien , entity , cloud , bugs , whatever it is we 're calling them , and report back , okay ? Yes , ma 'am . - And , Sergeant , no torching . - Yes , ma 'am ! ELI : Ooh ! I have an idea ! YOUNG : It 's gonna be dark soon . ELI : Okay , stand back . RILEY : Nothing 's happening . Ooh ! - Yes , there is . - It 's like vapor . We just can 't see them . That 's what they did when I first saw them . It 's like they just disappear . So they 're growing in numbers exponentially and consuming our resources without us even knowing it . You have to get them off the ship . JOHANSEN : Sergeant Greer , come in . I 'm a little busy right now . The bugs are getting into the water tank every time we open the hatch . Once we locate the main swarm , we 're going to have to find ... They 're in front of me right now . - Don 't antagonize them . - I won 't . Unless they antagonize me first . Do they move when you do ? They do now . What we need is an airlock . Unfortunately , there are none in the habitable compartments of the ship . I know what to do . YOUNG : This isn 't going to keep us going very long . SCOTT : Maybe Destiny will figure out we 're getting short on water and find us a planet with nice fresh water right next to the stargate . I mean , come on , we deserve a break . Scott ! Scott ! Can you hear me ? Yeah . Sorry , sir , the ice just gave way . Are you hurt ? Negative . I 'm okay , but I 'm wedged in pretty good . Good thing , too . Looks like a long way down . All right , just hold on . I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna throw a line down . Here it comes . I need you to tell me when you 've got it . Got it . YOUNG : Now , if you can manage it , run it under both your arms and fasten it across your chest . - SCOTT : Done this before , too , have you ? - Oh , yeah . At least a dozen times . - Okay . - Now , I want you to pull yourself up . I 'm gonna pull from this end . You ready ? - Yeah . - YOUNG : Okay , one , two , three ! Pull ! Pull , Scott ! Come on ! Pull ! Pull ! - How stuck are you ? - Pretty dang stuck . - Is there any way you can dig yourself out ? - I 'm not sure . That 's okay . That 's passed . Scott ? Still here , sir . All right , let 's just ... Let 's think about this for a second . - Destiny , this is Young . - Go ahead . YOUNG : We 've got a situation here . There was a tremor , and Scott fell through the snow into a crevasse . He 's fine , but he 's just out of reach . I tried to pull him up , but that 's not gonna happen anytime soon . How 's that other spacesuit coming ? We stopped work on that . I confined everyone to quarters . YOUNG : All right , it was just a thought . Well , we 'll figure it out . How 's your bug situation ? Same as before . Don 't worry about it . And don 't you worry either , T.J. I 'll be out of here in no time . Good luck . Johansen out . Everyone is lying . Yeah , grown-ups do that sometimes . This is Greer . It 's working . They 're moving away from us as we move forward . Good job . Keep it up . SCOTT : How about you lower the gun down , and I shoot myself free ? YOUNG : Yeah , that 's good thinking . There 's no way the bullets will ricochet into your ass . SCOTT : Well , maybe I can cut my way out with the plasma cutter . You get one hole in that suit , you 're dead . Maybe there 's a way for me to get down there . No , that 's just as stupid . " That 's just as stupid , sir . " The last thing we need is for both of us to be stuck down here . All right . Break off . You okay ? Closed in a little tighter , but I think ... What ? What ? I think I 'm losing suit pressure . I thought we were supposed to be confined to quarters . Yeah , well , I heard over the radio ... There was a tremor . Lieutenant Scott fell into a crevasse . - Oh , my God . - He 's okay . Just stuck . Do they have enough air ? Colonel Young says he 's got it under control . I just thought you would want to know . - Thanks . - Yeah . YOUNG : I think the ice tore a hole in his suit . ELI : How big a tear is it ? I can 't see it , but I can hear it . It 's hissing out pretty good . - An hour at most . - YOUNG : Plenty of time to make it back . Yeah , if I wasn 't stuck ! Colonel , you have to consider the amount of time you have left now . YOUNG : I 'm aware of the damn time , Rush . All I 'm saying is if you delay much longer ... YOUNG : Listen to me ! I know exactly what you 're saying , and I 'm not going anywhere without Lieutenant Scott , and that 's the way it 's gonna be ! What is the matter with you ? Miss Armstrong , you should return to your quarters . No , you know where you can go ? Now , look , Colonel , I understand your desire to rescue Lieutenant Scott , of course , and only you can decide how much time you have left , but , Lieutenant , if Colonel Young remains there trying to free you , to pull you up by himself , there 's a chance he might not make it back . SCOTT : He 's right . YOUNG : Just keep the gate active . We 're gonna make it back in time with your damn ice , which is all you really care about . - Colonel ... - Young out ! Damn , he 's a lot of work . This is Greer . I locked them up . Closing off the ventilation in that room . Okay , vents are closed . - Should be airtight . - What are they doing now ? GREER : Looking for a way out . Let 's hope they don 't find one . Come on ! Come on ! SCOTT : Sir . - Colonel ? - I 'm thinking . Go . - It 's okay . Come on , sir . - No , it 's not . We both know you 've done this before , too . Done what ? Lost people . Too many times . I 'm not ... I 'm not doing it again . - I can 't let you do it . - You don 't have a choice . Not that I 'm counting , but this is the third time in almost as many weeks that you 've been willing to kill yourself , and there 's a pretty good chance , at this point , I won 't be around to talk you out of it again . YOUNG : You know , you 're a fine young officer . You 've got a heart as big as a house , but I 'm not here because I want to die . I 'm here because I haven 't given up on saving your ass , so just shut up and think . GREER : They 're getting pissed off . Really pissed off . A few of them got out . What ? How ? We need a plan , Lieutenant ! I 'm coming down there ! This is beautiful out here . Scott . Lieutenant . Lieutenant ? Scott . Scott ! Scott ! Scott ! Scott ! Wake up , Scott ! Lieutenant ! Wake up ! Scott ! I need you to wake up , Scott ! Scott , come on ! Wake up ! Come on ! Come on ! Lieutenant ! Come on , I got you . That 's it , pull ! Pull , Lieutenant . Come on , Lieutenant . Lieutenant ! Okay , that 's it . Okay , that 's it , I got you . I got you . Okay . Okay . All right . You 're okay . Hey , hey , Scott , come on . Hang on , kid . - What 's the plan ? - We open the door , they go for the water , we close the lid . - GREER : All right , who 's gonna do that ? - I am . - No , no , no , I will . - I 'm not the one with the torch . No , look , I am not gonna let you do that ... I 'm not the one who 's killed any of them , Sergeant . You are . I 'll stand back , torch them if they get out . - No , I want you out of sight . - What , you don 't trust me ? No , I don 't . All right . Eli , I 'm ready . Make us a clear path to the Gate Room . Seal off everything else . You 're good . JOHANSEN : If this doesn 't work , lock this compartment off from the rest of the ship . Destiny , this is Young . I 'm on my way back with Scott . Come in . Okay , let them out . Okay , I got them ! All right , dial the gate . We 're on our way . Destiny , I 'm almost at the stargate with Scott . Shut it down so I can dial in . Colonel , we 're about to send these alien bugs through to the planet . - We 've no other choice . - What ? What ? RUSH : We need you to step away from the gate and remain as still as possible . They 're coming through now . - All right , here we go . - Let 's go . Get his helmet off . - Pick that up . - Yeah , I got him . Give her a hand . His pulse is thready , but he 's breathing . Let 's get him out of here . Sergeant Spencer , you step out of line again , I will deal with you personally . Understand ? Yes , sir . I don 't think he does . FRANKLIN : Colonel , I need to talk to you about the behavior of one of your men . PARK : No , that can wait . We need to go over the new rationing amounts - before the next ... VOLKER : - Colonel , I was scheduled to use the communication stones this morning ... FRANKLIN : This is a matter of rights ! PARK : Colonel ! VOLKER : Colonel ! Just a second , I was scheduled to use the communication stones ... At approximately 0300 hours ship time , Corporal Gorman succumbed to injuries sustained in an encounter with an alien entity . Lieutenant Johansen did everything that she could . I intend to hold appropriate services tomorrow at 1600 hours . How do I turn it off ?

Shut up , Chad , and read the news . How exactly did you get into a fight ? Crashing a party in Soho .

Let 's go ! - What is that ? Since their arrival , there 's been no contact With any of the 29 ships Now hovering over the major cities of the world . Come on , Ryan , pick up . Streets are jammed . People are trying to flee- - The ships moving through New York and L.A. Was enough to rock both cities for miles- - Ann.O.R.A.D. Is now confirming The first jet to encounter the spacecraft Experienced full electrical failure . Dude , this is " Independence Day " ! Which was a rip-off Of any number of alien invasion predecessors . Oh , thank god ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . Good . Oh , thank god ! - I need to get through . - Nobody is getting through . Look again , sergeant . I 'm FBI . Counterterrorism Division . - I can read . You 're still not getting past . - I 'm looking for my son . - Everybody is looking for their son right now . - My son is in there . - If you will let me in there , I can find him . - I 'm not gonna tell you again .

Tyler ! - Mom ! - Oh ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . Oh , god ! Oh , god ! Oh , my god . Yeah . Don 't be frightened . We mean no harm . Please accept our apologies . We 're truly anguished By the turmoil our arrival has caused . This is a momentous day . Until now , We believed we were the only intelligent life In the universe . We 're overjoyed to find that we 're not alone . My name is Anna , and I am the leader of my people . We 're delighted to meet you , But we need your help . We 're far from home ... After we 've replenished ourselves And shared with you what we can , We will leave you , Hopefully better than we found you . We look forward to getting to know our new friends . There will be more communication With your world 's leaders in the hours to come . Until then , We are of peace always . " We 're all god 's creatures " ? That 's how the vatican explains the existence of aliens ? Yes . - They decided that in a day ? - Yes . Rattlesnakes are god 's creatures , too . Doesn 't mean they 're good for us . - Have faith in our leaders , Jack . - I do , father . It 's just that there 's not a lot of scripture on the subject . - Meaning ? - I 'm at a loss to explain How god and aliens exist in the same world . - Aren 't you ? - What do you want to do , Jack ? - Call the vatican and question their position ? - No , I just ... - I don 't know what to do . - All we can do is - Pray and minster to our congregation . - Our congregation Amounts to two bag ladies , a heroin addict and Roy . That may be , father Landry , But we will minister to any size ... Congregation . And it appears there 's some kind of translation ... Look at that . It--it 's opening now Oh ! Dude--dude , that is so cool ! I was right there , man . I was right underneath that thing . Ohh ! Why didn 't I come with you , man ? - They 're calling themselves " the visitors . " - You say that like it bothers you . Visitors are old friends who drop by for a drink . Did you see that we got a comsat alert today ? Uh , no , I was a little busy Looking at the spaceships outside my window . - You 're looking at terrorist alerts ? - The chatter among terrorist cells worldwide Dropped like a rock when the V 's showed up . Except for one of the cells we 've been tracking . Their chatter--instead of falling off , it actually spiked . - So what , you think there 's a connection between the two ? - We intercepted an uncoded message from them . As of yesterday They 're suddenly looking to acquire large amounts of c-4 . Why do that unless you 're going after a target ? Like say us While we 're distracted ? I 'll run the databases . I 'll put together a profile on them . Thank you . You watching ? Yeah , I 'm watching . Anna and her entourage Will be escorted into the building where she ... Hey , how are you with all of this ? Are you and Tyler okay ? - We 're fine . - Did you hear from the ex ? He , uh , he left a message . He wanted us to know he 's okay . Um . I 'm not bitter . It 's fine . I feel good , happy . Hey , you know that I 'm here for you , anything you need . Look , we 'll hit the ground running tomorrow . Go be a mom . You rock . These are live pictures Coming to you from the lobby of the united nations ... - Hey , mom , it 's starting . - Yeah . Here--here is Anna . She is now approaching the mike for a statement . Let 's listen in . - Damn , she 's hot . - I know , right ? ! Right here , guys . This is an inspiring moment For us all- - Mankind and visitors coming together . We are honored by your friendship . We will cherish it , Nurture it And never abandon it . We are of peace always . Anna ! Anna , how long have you been ... Anna , what do you have to say - About the damage caused by your arrival ? - How do you explain--how do you explain - The similarities between visitors and humans ? - Our scientists say it 's impossible . - Our scientists can explain it . - That 's not an answer . Why don 't you explain it ? Hey , why don 't you show some respect ? Do you have a question ? Yeah . I have a question . Is there such a thing as an ugly visitor ? I don 't understand . Oh , you all seem to be what we consider attractive . Thank you . You 're not so bad yourself . Thank you . If . No , I 'm sorry . No one allowed past this point . - Come back here ! Anna ! - No one 's allowed past this point . It was a truly remarkable moment . In the midst of all the chaos and , yes , Even hostility from some , came something unexpected From our new friends- - a sense of humor . Should the press be so tough on the V 's ? They did just get here , after all . When we come back , to discuss that and much , much more . Stay with us . We 'll be right back . I want him . Yet thousands are still flocking To see the mother ships in person . As a result , host cities find themselves in the midst Of a mini economic boom- - Tourism , spending on v merchandise- - All a welcome shot in the arm to local economies . The newly opened visitor healing centers Are drawing huge crowds . People afflicted With one of the 65 ailments the v 's can cure Are jamming the centers , hoping for their own personal miracle . And government officials have begun talks To open visitor embassies . But not everyone likes the idea . Violent protests denouncing the v 's Have broken out in numerous host cities . And more demonstrations are planned in the days to come . More on this ... - We finally got a real lead on our cell . - Our cell ? - I 've heard that one before . - No , this is a good one . That 's my coffee . A truck suspected of hauling drugs Was impounded by N.Y.P.D. Last night . They searched for residue- - no drugs . But they did find traces of ... C-4 . Uh-huh . See this ? The truck came from here on long island . Nice ! - Field trip ? - Can I drive ? No . Silos are empty . We 're still searching the grounds , But I gotta tell you . This feels like another dead end . - Yeah . - What 's this , 20 leads we found on this cell so far ? - Every one of them 's fallen through . - Uh-huh . What ? Look at the sat photo . - Yeah ? - That 's our truck . What is a white truck doing parked in front of that shack ? Nothin ' . I think we can rule out suicide . C-4 . Yeah , this is Ryan . I need your help . How 'd you get this number ? They 're here . It 's starting . I 'm not that guy anymore . Don 't call me again . Hey . Hey . Ready for lunch ? Oh , yeah . I 'm hungry . Mmm . What if that was important ? Sweetheart , there is nothing more important than you . How 'd you get tickets ? Dude , I can 't believe we 're about to see the inside - of a freakin ' spaceship . - You rock . Holy ! This is awesome . Dude ! This is incredible , man ! It 's like an amusement park . ... To the main docking station will only take About two minutes , so hang on tight and enjoy the ride . Wow . Unbelievable , man . Step this way , please , And welcome . Hello . Welcome to the New York mother ship . My name is Lisa . The examiner says the body 's been dead less than a day , But he was tortured before he was killed . They 've been printing fake docs--passports , I.D 's . Best fakes I 've ever seen . It 's a major operation , but no one was here . They cleared out like they knew we were coming . We 'll get the prints off the victim , See if we can get his I.D. Our ability to manipulate gravity Is essential for long-term space travel . Dude , dude , check it out . Oh , dude . That V girl 's coming over here . Be cool . Having a good time ? Having a great time . Good . Have you heard about our new peace ambassador program ? Peace ambassador program ? Yeah . You sign up , hang out with V 's , Learn about our culture , And you act as V ambassadors to your own communities . You even get a uniform . Ah , it sucks . You have to be 18 years old to join . We 're only 17 . You can still join . You just need your parent 's signature . Yeah . Well , that 's , uh , kind of a tough sell right now . Our parents don 't even know we 're here . Too bad . I just got assigned to the New York chapter . We could 've spent some time together . We 're all so quick to jump on the bandwagon . And a ride on the bandwagon , it 's ... It sounds like fun . But before we get on , Let us at least make sure it is sturdy ... And sound . Let us at least examine it To really make sure It is something that we want to climb aboard . No one is saying , " don 't trust the visitors . " Don 't they need to earn our trust ? It 's something we all need to think about . I thought we were clear about this , Jack . People need to hear the V 's are part of god 's plan . They hear it from you , father . They need to hear it from you , too . I thank god for the visitors every day , Jack . This church stood empty for years . Now look at it . The visitors are not driving people away from god . They 're driving people back to god . People are scared , father . That 's why they come . But they come , and that 's the blessing in disguise . It bothers me that they showed up Right when we needed them the most . The world 's in bad shape , father . Who wouldn 't welcome a savior right now ? I agree they 're a godsend , and we should be grateful . But that 's the danger . Under the right conditions and with enough time , Gratitude can worth into worship ... Or worse--devotion . hey . I thought you priest types would like to see somethin ' . They healed me . I got no pain . My god , Roy . It 's amazing . Yeah . Ty . Come here for a second . Your principal sent me this link to this ... Awesome video . - What are you doing on my account ? - Check it out . More , more , more ! Come on ! V 's rule ! Come on ! Hurry up . There 's gonna be people coming . V 's rule ! V 's rule , man ! First and foremost , the fact that you 're tagging now- - So proud . I called Brandon 's folks to kind of , you know , spread the joy . They weren 't surprised . They said that you two are obsessed with the V 's . I 'm not obsessed . Really ? Because this looks very obsessive to me . Texts , instant messages . And here 's an--an entire page About how to spread their word - through tagging . - Those aren 't even my links . - Brandon sent them to me . - Oh . Well , that 's okay then . Brandon sent them to you . So you 're gonna do whatever brandon or--or t 's Or who--whoever tells you to do ? - You have to think for yourself , Tyler . - I do think for myself ! Tagging someone 's property because a web site tell you to Is thinking fourself ? You call it tagging . But you know what ? The v 's- - they call it spreading hope . Okay . Okay . You have to talk to me . Come here . You and me , we talk . What going on with you ? Is it because of your dad ? Is it because he left ? You 're blaming him ? At least he has an excuse To be out of touch with his kid . He left me . I did not leave . I am here for you . Oh , when you 're here . There he is- - the man of the hour . Hello , Mr. Decker . Hello . - What 's going on , Freddie ? - You 've been selected . For ? Anna would like to do a live broadcast from the ship , And intimate one-on-one to help ease the protests against us . She 'd like you to do the interview . I-I-I got it . Who was that ? It 's no one . - No one ? - Yes . No one . You 've been getting a lot of calls from " no one . " It 's nothing . Okay ? We don 't do this , you and me- - Keep secrets . Talk to me . What 's going on ? What 's going on ? sweetheart ... Just ... Don 't read things into things , okay ? It was no one . Really . So pretty - I forgot my spoon . - Yeah . Uh , can I get an extra spoon ? Okay . Thank you , sir . What do you know ? Another fake one . Others like this . Solve the case yet , Sherlock ? Not one name , not one photo , Not anything from these passports Matches anyon our system . How can you not find this guy ? He 's very creepy . If only " creepy " were a biometric parameter - In our facial recognition software . - You 're kind of sexy when you talk all computer-y . - I am ? - Absolutely . What 's this ? Progress . I I.D.ed our victim from the silo . His name is Owen Chapman . This is a search warrant for his house . All right . Yeah , I 'll check ... They knew we were coming again . Someone tipped them off . Who are you calling ? Owen . Owen--our victim Owen ? Text . " To : All attending tonight . " Location : 400 Pier Avenue , Brooklyn , 10 : 00 P.M. Pass code . " If you 're new , be prepared for the test . Any info you can share about this cell is important . " Owen was going to a meeting about a sleeper cell ? If you have info about a sleeper cell , You call the cops . You don 't go to a meeting . Ryan . - Stay away from me , Georgie . - Ryan , please . Look , I told you I 'm not that guy anymore , okay ? - Stop calling me . - We need your help . - " We " ? Who 's " we " ? - There 's about 25 of us . We 've only met a couple times but we 're still recruiting . Again ? You 're trying that again After all those people got killed the last time ? We 're being a lot more careful this time . - Please , you gotta help us . - Look , I 'm about to get engaged , okay ? I 'm not gonna put my fiancée at risk . If I get involved , it puts her at risk , - And I 'not gonna let that happen . - So you 're just gonna sit there on the sidelines ? You know how many lives are at stake ? She doesn 't know about my past , okay ? I 'd like to keep it that way . That 's where we 're meeting if you change your mind ... Or grow a conscience . I liked your sermon the other day . You 're right to question the V 's . Are you all right ? I know the real reason they 're here , father , And I am not the only one . The real reason ? The V 's are gonna obliterate us . You 're bleeding ! I was coming to see you . The V 's did this to me . Let me get you some help . No , no , no . Take this and go to this address And give it to the people there . All right , all the information 's inside . - Promise me . - Okay . Please , it 's important . Okay . Okay , okay . I 'm gonna get you some help . I 'll be right back . Thanks again for choosing me to do this . - I 'm really excited . - So are we . Do you have any questions before we go to air ? No . Just be sure not to ask anything That would paint us in a negative light . Excuse me ? Don 't ask any questions that would portray us negatively . Ask ones like you did when we first met . Oh , I think there 's a mistake . I 'm a journalist . It 's my job to ask questions Even if they make the other person uncomfortable . That was not my understanding . Standing by to go to air . Afraid I don 't have a choice . This interview is now canceled . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hang on . Hang on . Look , this is just how it 's done . I swear I 'll be fair . You 'll need to be more than fair if you want to proceed . - Two minutes to air . - We can 't be seen in a negative light . This interview would elevate your career , Wouldn 't it , Mr. Decker ? Don 't you want to elevate your career ? You don 't even know what this meeting is , And you 're just gonna go in like you 're invited . They 're expecting people they haven 't met before , so , yeah . - This is stupid . Why don 't we call for backup ? - You know why . Because you think that there 's a mole tipping off our cell . - It 's a closed loop if it 's just you and me . - All right , then I 'm coming in with you . No . It 's a bad idea . I need you to watch the perimeter . I will be back in 30 minutes . If I 'm not , you can call in the cavalry . I 'm here for the meeting . This is a word-of-mouth group . You 're here because someone we trust Personally referred you . This is how we do things . This woman is a doctor . She 'll be injecting a small dose of anesthetic into each of you . Wait--wait a minute . Anesthetic for what ... Exactly ? Good evening and welcome . Tonight , " prime focus with Chad Decker " Is proud to present An up close and personal interview with Anna , The visitor high commander . On behalf of all of us , I wanna thank you For this opportunity to get to know you a little better . Thank you , Chad , And please , feel free to ask anything and everything . I 'm here to discuss all topics without reserve . I want you to confirm that you see skull bone . Take a good look at it . It 's important . You 're next . What is life like where you come from ? We come from a place of great beauty , Vast cities , massive oceans . Much like earth . Though unlike you , We don 't divide ourselves into countries . We 're one united people . - You 've all passed the test . - Test for what ? To ensure that you 're not a visitor . In order to walk among us , They disguise their appearance By cloning human flesh over their own reptilian skin . I thought everyone here was up to speed . The visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . You 've said we 're the only other intelligent life You 've encountered in your travels . Yes . Humanity is a rare gift , One we hold in the highest regard . For decades , they 've been implementing a plan That will result in the extermination Of every man , woman and child on the face of this earth . We 're honored and privileged to be able to assist mankind With our knowledge and technology . Truth be told , it stirs great emotion in us . So you are emotional beings ? we are , but we 've evolved To quickly process and expel all negative feelings . Happiness , we 've learned , Comes from tranquility and peace . V 's posing as humans Established themselves in all facets of life , Whether it be business , government , Religion , the military . It took years . And once embedded among us , They set out to cause worldwide instability- - Unnecessary wars , Economic meltdown , Faith twisted into extremism . If you could speak to the protesters , What would you say ? That embracing change is never easy , But the reward for doing so Can be far greater than anything you can imagine . Tonight we 're announcing The expansion of our healing centers . The goal is to open one in every major city across the world . The final stage of the visitors ' plan Began with them revealing themselves to us . They gain trust with the promise Of friendship and technology . And , of course , all they 're really doing Is positioning themselves as the saviors of mankind . The intent goes beyond just healing . We want to provide complete medical services to all . You 're talking about ... Universal alth care ? I believe that 's what you call it , yes . By the time people figure this out , It 'll be too late . They 'll take over Unless we can stop ' em . I see the looks . It 's the first time hearing this for so of you . You think we 're crazy . Right ? Do you have any proof ? You know , other than scary stories Being passed around the internet . Who are you ? Who referred you ? It doesn 't matter . I 'm leaving . Wait , wait . I have proof ... I think . It 's a bunch of photos- - Supposedly visitors living on earth . - This guy is a visitor ? - Yeah . This guy is a terrorist . He 's part of a sleeper cell . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . A sleeper cell of visitors . Yeah , a sleeper cell of visitors . You did a brave thing coming here tonight . Well , if I 'm so brave , why am I scared to death ? I think that makes you human . I 'm Erica . Jack . Get down ! Ryan ! What the hell , Dale ? ! Aah ! Aah ! No , Erica ! Let 's get out of here . Come on . Get out of here ! Come on ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Where the hell did they come from ? - We were so careful this time . - Georgie- - No . You were right to walk away . - What hope do we have ? - There is hope . But they are animals ! No . No . Not all of them . I was wrong to walk away from this , Georgie . You were right to fight . There 's others out there like me , Other traitors , deserters . We 'll help . Ryan . Where you going ? I gotta go tell Val I 'm leaving . It 's not safe for her to be around me anymore . Mr. Decker ? Mr. Decker , may I have a word with you , please ? Anna loved you . I 'm sure she did . She wants you to know we intend to call on you again . She trusts you . Yeah , I 'm not so sure I trust her . Look , I 'm sorry for the misunderstanding tonight , But you did the right thing . Compromising one 's principles for the greater good Is not a shameful act . It 's a noble one . Really ? I find that hard to believe . Your people are easily threatened . What you did tonight Went a long way toward reassuring them . - What 's the harm ? - She backed me into a corner . She could 've chosen anyone to interview her . She chose you . We would like to continue with the arrangement . Whenever Anna has something significant to say , We would like her to say it through you . Unless you have an aversion To a worldwide audience hanging on your every word . Val ? I hate myself . You just--you kept getting these call from " no one , " and ... I thought there was somebody else . I-I looked around and I found this . You were gonna ask me to marry you . I was even gonna get down on one knee . Do you still love me ? More than you 'll ever know . I don 't know who to trust anymore . I can 't get the image Of dale just lying there out of my head . What do we do now ? We help build a resistance . We recruit ... Bring more into the fold . We have to be careful . We 'll be careful , but we have to fight . Oh , we 'll fight . They have a big head start . They 're arming themselves with the most ... Powerful weapon out there . Yeah ? What 's that ? Erica , what big weapon ? Devotion . To the dawn of a new day . We are of peace always .

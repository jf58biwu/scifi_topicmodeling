 I guess it 's official . Now , we 're fugitives . You made this animal . Why would you do such a thing ? Because we could . ( narrator ) Rich and Audrey learned that the creatures were genetically engineered . [ crying ] Have you seen my mother ? And that there are other creatures as well . They made another discovery . I know that guy . ( Laura ) He was there when the creatures breached at Bolinas Bay with Cirko . ( Rich ) Guy would have to be 80 . ( narrator ) Miles was bitten , and hasn 't been the same ever since . The creatures have killed . ( police officer ) If we tag and release it here , he 'll lead us back to the school . Will you help us ? ( narrator ) And authorities released Nimrod as bait . Fire ! Everybody out of here ! ( narrator ) Miles saved the town . Now , Surface continues . Hey , guys , stop it . Stop it , stop it . Get outta here . Go over there and play . Hey , girls ! Girls , come to mommy . Hey , it 's Daddy . Come on , come to Mommy immediately . Honey ? Honey ? Honey , it 's me .

So , Koestler heads an expedition up in the ' 50s , right ? Out to Central Asia , and they find something . Okay , they find a way to create life . Change life . Right ? Oh , look , to tell you the truth , I really don 't give a damn about the science behind that talking monkey . All I know is that the feeling that I had when that thing looked at me ? What they 're doing over there is unnatural . It 's immoral . Evil ! Do you think it was , like , an accident ? You know , they 're , like , they 're playing with DNA and all of a sudden an experiment slips off the table and escapes into the ocean ? Yeah , and now they 're just not wanting to ' fess up to it . And they 're covering their tracks . They ain 't covered all their tracks . ? No , no , stop ! Stop , what 's wrong with you guys ? I 'm really sorry . I don 't know what 's gotten into ' em today . Come on ! Come on . ( Caitlin on receiver ) Miles , is that you ? Hello ? Hi . Hi . I 'm here to see Davis Lee . Do you have an appointment ? He 'll want to see me . Name ? Koestler . Sir , there 's an Alger Koestler for you in the lobby . There was a man here to see me . Yes , he left this for you . Walk . There are security cameras all over this garage .

Please , don 't make me shoot you . Get off him ! Just stay there , just stay right there ! Just stay right there ! Don 't move . Oh , my God ! Get the tape . Oh God . What ? Get the tape ! Okay . It 's all right . All right . Oh God ! I can 't get him . Come on ! Oh God ! Go , start the car . Start the car ! I was driving around all night looking for you . Yeah . I mean , the last time I saw you , you were heading off in front a thousand of those things . But at least you 're okay . And I 'm glad you called me , even if it was just to get some dry clothes and bum a ride . You called your parents , right ? No , just you . You gotta call ' em , Miles . They gotta be worried sick . I 'm going home . After this . Okay . Where did you go , anyway ? I don 't know . It was--it was a blur . I-I remember them following , but then , it 's like- - Like what ? Like instinct took over . Mm ! Are you okay ? He 's here . Who ? Come here . ( man ) Don 't get too close to him . Stanley ! I wouldn 't do that if I were you . Put it down . We 're leaving . Let 's go . ( man ) Get him outta here . Go . ( Daughtery ) Listen , please don 't go crazy , don 't do anything else , that we would regret . We know about Koestler . We know he led an expedition into Central Asia . Maybe Mongolia . And we know that he discovered something there that helped build Lorentec . But that isn 't his real legacy . Is it ? I 'll show you something . Oh ! Now ... who is that ? Looks awful familiar , doesn 't he ? Listen . Either--either that 's your father , or ... an uncle , or it 's you . We know that Koestler was a generation ahead of his peers in genomics . He cloned a sheep 20 years before Dolly . How much longer would it take him to clone a man ? We know his research made those things in the ocean . ? I have no idea where he is . I know , I know . I just keep thinking he 's all right , and um- - He 'll show up any minute , walk through the door . Miles ! Miles , oh , don 't ever leave like that again . I don 't buy it . Not for a second . I think you know exactly what you are . Where 'd you grow up ? Huh ? I bet you adopted . No siblings , only child , probably raised in a foster home . You 're life 's a lie . This guy . That 's who you really are . Yeah . Go on , look at him . Look at him . Look at him . That 's who you are ! You go to hell . Me go to hell ? Rich , Rich , stop ! Huh ? Stop , stop it . Hey , whoa , stop . I owed him one . Yeah , but if he 's telling the truth ? What if he really doesn 't know ? Who cares , he 's a murderer ! We 're not . You 're right . I just , uh , got a little carried away . Let 's--maybe we should talk about this outside for a sec . Yeah . Rich ! Rich ! Rich , open this door ! Let me back in , please . Rich , please ! Rich ! ( Rich ) Stop yelling , and let me do what I gotta do . [ punching and grunting ] Now , come on ! These things are out in the ocean . They 're killing people . Now ... what was it , huh ? Was it just some sort of experiment gone wrong ? Now , they 're just trying to cover up their accident ? What ? It wasn 't an accident . Then what is it ? Answer ! Answer me ! You got a lotta calls to 910 here , Davis . What is that ? That North Carolina ? What you got going on down south ? ( operator recording ) You 've reached Iderdex Systems' Central Cryogenics facility in Wilmington , North Carolina . Iderdex ? What 's going down in North Carolina you gotta call there all the time ? You think it 's funny ? I 'm getting tired of asking you . Last chance . If it ain 't an accident , then what is it ? Rich , put the gun down ! Stop . Just relax , all right , look at this . Look , that 's Iderdex . You didn 't use that , did you ? Yeah . Oh . It 's traceable ! We gotta get outta here , we gotta get outta here . All right , all right . Geez .

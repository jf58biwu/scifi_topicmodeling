 So that 's , you know , coming along . I 'm working with a vocal coach . Strengthening the ... ah . Lot of guys ignore the laugh and that 's about standards . If you want to get into the evil league of evil , you have to have a memorable laugh . What ? Did you think Bad Horse didn 't work on his neigh ? His terrible death weenie . No response BTW from the league yet . But my application is strong this year . A letter of condamnation from the deputy mayor . That 's gotta have some weight so ... Fingers crossed ! E-mails ! Too-sly-for-you writes " hey , genius ! " Whoa ! Sarcasm , that 's original ! " Where are the gold bars you were supposed to pull out of that bank vault with your transmatter ray ? " " Obviously it failed or it would be in the papers . " Well , no , they 're not gonna say anything in the press but ... behold ! Transported from there to here ! The molecules tend to shift during the ... transmatter ... . uh ... advance . But they were transported in bar form . And they clearly were ... And by the way it 's not about making money , it 's about taking money . Destroying the status quo because the status is not quo . The world is a mess and I just ... need to rule it . I 'm gonna ... Smells like cuman . So transmatter is 75 % . And more importantly the freeze ray is almost up . This is the one . It stops time . Freeze ray . Tell your friends . We have ... Oh , here 's one from our good friend Johnny Snow . " Dr. Horrible , I see you are once again afraid to do battle with your nemesis . I waited at Dully Park for 45 minutes . " Okay , dude . You 're not my nemesis . My nemesis is Captain Hammer . Captain Hammer corporate tool . He dislocasted my shoulder . Again . Last week . Look , I 'm just trying to change the world , okay ? I don 't have time for a grudge match with every poser in a park . Besides there 's kids in that park so ... Here 's one from dead-not-sleeping . Long time watcher , first time writing . Blah blah blah blah . " You always say in your blog that you will show her the way , show her you 're a true villain . Who is her ? And does she even know that you 're ... Laundry day ... See you there . Under things ... tumbelling . Wanna say ... " Love your hair " Here I go ... mumbling . With my freeze ray I will stop ... the world . With my freeze ray I will find the time to find the words to ... tell you how ... how you make ... make me feel . What 's the phrase ? Like a fool . Kinda sick . Special needs . Anyways ... with my freeze ray I will stop ... the pain . It 's not a death ray or an ice beam , that 's right Johnny Snow . I just think that you need time to know that I 'm the guy to make it real . The feelings you don 't dare to feel . I 'll bend the world to our will . And we 'll make time stand still . That 's the plan . Rule the world . You and me . Any day . - Love your hair . - What ? No , I love the air . Anyway , with my freeze ray I will stop ... - Hey , doc . - Moist , my heroe . Moisture , buddy , what 's going on ? Life of crime . Got your mail . Hey , didn 't you go on a date last night ? Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch . Yeah . Yeah ? It was alright . I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but ... I hear you . I saw Penny today . You talked to her ? So close . Just a few weeks from a real audible connection . I 'm gonna ask ... Oh my God ! Is that from the league ? It 's from him , that 's his seal , isn 't it ? The leader ? Oh my God ! I got a letter from Bad Horse ! That 's so hardcore . Bad Horse is legend , he rules the league with an iron hoof . Are you sure ... Bad Horse ! He rides across the nation the thorough bread of sin . He got the application that you just sent in . It needs evaluation so let the games begin . A heinous crime to show of course . A murder would be nice of course . Bad Horse ... is bad ! The evil league of evil is watching so beware ! The grade that you receive will be the last we swear . so make the Bad Horse proud or he 'll make you his mare . You saddled up , there 's no recourse . It high ho silver , side that horse . - I don 't know . - Are you kidding ? This is great ! I 'm about to pull a major heist ! You know , the Wonderflonium that I need for the freeze ray ? It 's being transported tomorrow ! Armored car ? Carrier van . Candy for a baby . Do you need anything dampened or made soggy ? Thanks but ... the league is watching . I gotta do this alone . Will you lend a caring hand to shelter those who need it ? You only have to sign your name . Don 't even have to read it . Would you help ... No ? How about you ? - Will you lend a caring hand ... - Ah ! What ? I was wondering if I could just ... Hey ! I know you . Hello . You know me . Cool ! I mean ... yeah , you do . Do you ? From the laundromat . Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice last month you skipped a weekend . Or ... if that was you . Could have been someone else . I mean , I 've seen you . Billy is my name . I 'm Penny . What are you doing ? Hmmm texting . It 's very important or I would stop . What are you doing ? Actually , I 'm out here volunteering for the Caring Hands homeless shelter . Can you spare a minute ? Hum ... Okay , go . We 're hoping to open a new location soon . Expand our efforts . There 's this great building nearby that the city is just gonna demolish and turn into a parking lot . - But if we get enough signatures ... - Signatures ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . Go on . I was saying ... Maybe we could get the city to donate the building to our cause . We would be able to pry 250 new beds , get people off the streets and into job training so they could buy rocket packs and go to the Moon and become florists . You 're not really interested in the homeless , are you ? No , I am . But they 're a symptom . You 're treating a symptom and the disease rages on , consumes the human race . The fish rots from the head as they say . So my thinking is why not cut off the head . Of the human race ? It 's not a perfect metaphor but I 'm talking about an overall of the system . Putting the power in different hands . I 'm all for that ! - This petition is about the building . - I 'd love to sign it . Thank you ! Sorry , I come on strong . But you signed ! I don 't wanna turn my back on a fellow laundering person . Well , if we can 't stick together , I don 't ... I 'll probably see you there . No , I will . I ... She talked to me . Why did she talk to me now ? Maybe I should ... A man 's gotta do what a man 's gotta do . Don 't plan the plan if you can 't follow through . All that matters is taking matters into your own hands . Soon I 'll control everything . Hey ! Hey ! My wish is your command ! Stand back everyone ! Nothing here to see ! Just imminent danger and in the middle of it : me ! Captain Hammer 's here ! Hair bowing in the breeze ! The day needs my saving expertise ! A man 's gotta do what a man 's gotta do . His destiny ends with me saving you . The only doom that 's glooming is you loving me to tears . I 'll give you a second to catch your breath . You idiot ! Dr. Horrible , I should have known you were behind this ! - You almost killed her ! - I remember it differently . If she ... It 's curtains for you , Dr. Horrible . Lacey gently wafting curtains . Thank you , Hammer man , I don 't think I can explain how important it was that you stopped the van . I 'd be splattered , I 'd be crushed in the debris . Thank you , sir , for saving me ! Don 't worry about it ! A man 's gotta do what a man 's gotta do . - You came from above . - Are you kidding ? What heist were you watching ? Stop looking at her like that . Did you notice that he threw you in the garbage ? - My heart is beating ... - When ass needs kicking , - when bombs are ticking ... - I stopped the van ! The remote control was in my hand ! Whatever ! So please give me a second to catch my breath . Balls !

 People think I collect art , but I really collect our lives fixed in paint . A perfect moment capturing an entire existence , made immortal . What you 've done is not evolution , it 's murder . What I am doing ... is revenge . A monster 's fight to survive ... and live to kill again . A mother willing to fracture her own soul to protect her child . Don 't lie to me anymore . You told me she was gone . Now which one of you is in control ? Niki , Jessica ? I 'm not so sure . Youth struggle for innocence , despite life 's cruelty . Who are you ? I 'm your grandmother . The double-edged lies needed to sustain a double-edged life . He is going to be a problem . Why don 't we do it right now ? Sorry . - What do we think ? - He 's telling the truth . He doesn 't know where Claire is . A wandering hero 's pure joy at success . And his darkest hour , when all the world seems lost . All perfect moments frozen in time . Alone , each tells a single story . Together they can tell the future . Daddy , I 'm so sorry . It 's all my fault . I tried to do what you said , but they caught me , and now ... I 'm so scared . What is it ? You . You 're not ... Not what ? Not you . Why don 't you leave us alone , Candice ? Are you sure ? I can show him things that would make him tear his eyes out . You 've got more important matters to take care of . Things okay in here ? Do you need anything ? I just got through with this Graham Greene I was reading . I 'll bring it . How was it ? Ended bad . I don 't know where Claire is . None of these games can make me tell you what I don 't know . I 'm going easy on you . The only reason we haven 't ... taken it up a notch , is ... because of friendship . Friendship ? I brought you in , vouched for you . And how do you repay my kindness ? Attempting to destroy the company ? You asked me to betray my daughter . You got too close . And then you got sloppy . I saw what your girl Candice can do . Maybe you 're the one who got sloppy . Maybe I 'm exactly where I want to be . You 're on death row . If you were gonna kill me , you 'd have done it by now . I 'm just waiting for the order . That 's how we do it here . We follow orders . I 'll see about getting you that book . Japanese feudalism . Renaissance , Baroque , Mayan , Persian . 20th century . You must bring all your first dates here ? What do you do with all this ? I protect it . I shield it from a greedy and dangerous world . You push the cultured facade long enough , people forget you 're a criminal . When my day of judgment comes , Nathan , I 'll be remembered as a humanitarian . I care about the world . I just want to save it . To heal it . And to do that , I need you . What could you possibly know about healing ? A few things . Parkman . Parkman , wake up . - They 're just waiting ... - You gotta be kidding me . They 're coming for you . They 're just waiting for the order . And then you 're never coming back . Not to your wife , or anyone else you care about . They 'll never see you again . We don 't have much time . If you can hear me , and if you can trust me , bang on the pipe . Good man . If you follow everything I say , you might not die . You may want to argue , but luckily this is a one-way conversation . Can I count on you ? I hate him . Yes or no ? I know this man . Well , great . If you see him , tell him I want my sword back . He said he needed it to save the world . A lot of people seem to be saying that these days . Well ... we all have our roles to play in the events to come . You know , this isn 't just a collection of art . This ... is a road map . These artists envisioned a brighter future . Peace , prosperity . That 's your idea of a brighter future ? What if I was to tell you that it was ? I 'd say you were a lousy humanitarian . I was a lot younger than you when I discovered my power . And there were others too , like me , who discovered theirs . We were all confused . And we found each other . Together , we tried to make a difference to the world . And for a while , we did . It was beautiful . And then , some of my ... friends ... they lost their way . They used their powers for personal gain . And all the good that we 'd done was ... Well , it amounted to nothing . And I learned that healing one person at a time was just not enough . We needed something ... something to pull it down on course . Something big . And that 's what you think this is ? People need hope , Nathan . An explosion of that magnitude would destroy half the population of New York City like that . There 's six and a half billion people on the planet . That less than .07 % . Come on , that 's an acceptable loss by anyone 's count . - By anybody 's count ? - Look , I said people need hope , but they trust fear . This is crazy . This tragedy will be a catalyst for good . For change . Out of the ashes , humanity will find a common goal . A united sense of hope couched in a united sense of fear . And it is your destiny , Nathan , to be the leader who uses this event to rally a city , a nation , a world . Now you look deep into your heart . You 'll know I 'm right . I don 't mean to toss a wet blanket , but if you haven 't noticed , I 'm down in the polls . I 'm not gonna get elected to Congress . Let alone the White House . Do you think I 'd leave that to chance ? If you know all this , then you also know that the exploding man is my brother Peter . As I said , we all have our role to play . Peter 's curtain call will come the day after you 're elected . You 're insane . You know that ? Now , all that banging has alerted the guards . What ? You told me to signal you ! Don 't worry , it 's a good thing . Now look for the rusted pipe . Pipes . It should be the one closest to the window . A couple of hits will loosen it . Hurry up ! A guard will be there . You 've got three minutes . Come on ! By now you should have removed the pipe . The guard will be coming through the door any second now . Signal when you 've knocked him out . Yeah , I 'm working on it . Come on ! Grab his pass , and head into the hall . Suresh ? It 's Peter Petrelli . Mohinder ? Sylar . I remember you . You 're like me , aren 't you ? I 'd like to see how that works . Not now . I 'm not done with him yet . Interesting . I can 't wait to try that one . My God . My two boys actually getting along . Nathan 's wedding . He has two boys of his own now . And that handsome man is Peter . But you 've already met him now , haven 't you ? He saved my life . He forgot to mention that we were related . Oh , he didn 't know . He didn 't even know you existed . But you did ? Since you were a baby . Nathan 's folly in Texas . And you kept me a secret ? I cared about you a great deal . Perhaps not in the traditional sense ... oatmeal cookies and school plays ... but I did what I could . My husband and I made arrangements for you . Arrangements ? Then that fire happened , and ... Nathan just assumed you were gone , so ... So you let him . It was the right thing to do . You need to be protected . Trust me , I don 't need protecting . Because you can grow back your bones and spit up bullets ? You have no idea , Claire . The life your abilities would bring you ... You deserve better . And that 's why you have to go . Get you away , like we planned . I haven 't seen Peter , or met my father yet . Neither of them is in a position to be anything to you right now . Be sensible . By shipping me off to Paris ? For now , yes . I 'll be taking you there myself . You 'll have a chance to grow up and develop into someone who can make her own choices . And then if you choose to come back and join this madness , like I once did , at least I will have given you the option . So you 're like me ? I regret a lot of the choices I 've made in my life . You 're getting the benefit of my experience . Whether I want it or not . You get that mouth from me . The list ... no ! My editor needs these pages right away , so I called my best messenger . Oh , man , the new 9th Wonders . I 've been dying to find out what happens to Hiro . The latest , and the last . Last ? Looks that way . Why , what do you mean ? Never mind . So what happens to Hiro in this one ? You promise you won 't post any spoilers ? The future ? How do you come up with this stuff ? It 's a gift . Speaking of which ... Your sketchbook ? Are you serious ? Hold on to it . It might be worth something someday . Thank you . Working for a gangster like Linderman , pulling triggers for him . Everything I 've done , I 've done for Micah . You keep telling yourself that . Hey , if it wasn 't for me , Niki would still be in prison , Micah wouldn 't have a mother , and you 'd be all alone . I don 't remember you complaining . Niki , Jessica , whoever the hell you are , I 'm done . - I 'm taking Micah , and ... - Careful how you finish that sentence . He 's not safe as long as Linderman owns our lives . Not as long as you 're around . Look at what you brought into our house . What , money ? Rent ? Poor me ! Nobody wants to hire a black ex-con . Everywhere you go , people die . Cash , cars , hurting people for the fun of it . Hell , you didn 't turn into Jessica . You turned into your old man . Don 't you dare . I 'll die before I 'll let you do to Micah what he did to you . Miss Sanders ... Mr. Linderman has asked to see you right away . If this is the life you want , you need to get Micah out of it . You can say good-bye tonight . The first door on the right is the supply room . Steal something less conspicuous . Keep moving . You 'll see an exit door before the hall . Orders came down . We 're moving Bennet , Sprague , and Parkman . Now make sure you gas Sprague 's room before you put the IV in him . I don 't want that man so much as dreaming . What about Parkman ? Put some tape on his mouth . I don 't want to hear any more about his pregnant wife . You want to do what ? ! We gotta go . Quickly ! Go ... how did you even get in here ? Bennet , he 's got a plan . Bennet ? Were you listening to him ? He told me to come get you . He could be leading you right where he wants you to go . It can 't be worse than the alternative . Mrs. Petrelli ? Yes . I 'm so sorry . It 's Peter . What about him ? I found this address in his wallet . I didn 't know where else to go . I couldn 't leave him . He 's dead . He was killed ... murdered ... trying to save my life . I was in over my head and ... Get out of here . I 'm sorry ? Please leave ... now . Mr. Linderman will see you now . Linderman ? You 're kidding . Linderman doesn 't see anyone . Not if I can help it . Fearsome Jessica , finally . Sweet Niki , yes , but you ... I never had the pleasure . You were due . We 've both certainly come a long way , haven 't we , since you borrowed that $ 30,000 and conveniently forgot to repay . Oh , by the way ... I 've had to have that room repainted since your last assignment . What is this ? I need a small favor . You 're Linderman . When you need something , you send your boys . When it 's something big , you send lawyers . This must be off the charts . It 's all a matter of perspective . I need to borrow your Micah briefly . Borrow ? Yeah , that is , his talent . I want to help Micah achieve something monumental in his life . I had a plan in place that , until recently , began to unravel . I need your son to help me repair it . Micah wasn 't part of our deal . I don 't want him involved in all this . Understand , Micah is involved by the mere fact of his birth . Now , I 've been , I think , more than fair to you . I mean , I helped you out of a tough spot . Spared you that long walk to the gas chamber even . So ... a chocolate milk , all the cookies he can eat , and I 'll tell you what . I 'll even make him a fresh sandwich myself . If you need something from me , point and I 'll shoot . Micah 's off limits . The request was a courtesy , dear . Send anyone you want ... you 're not touching my son . We 'd better take out an insurance policy on Miss Sanders . The power grid ! Why does he want me to do , melt it ? No , no , he says you 've gotta ... - What the hell 's an E.M.P. ? - I don 't know ! It 's an electromagnetic pulse that causes a high-intensity photoelectron surge . I don 't know what he 's saying , but he says it 's not radioactive ! - He says it 's clean . - But I don 't know how to do that ! He said you 'd say that . He says ... You have no concept of your potential ! You can focus all your energy into one burst . He says don 't burn hot , burn bright . Does that make sense ? Did he say anything else ? I shouldn 't stand next to you . The power 's out , let 's go ! - No . We 've gotta get Bennet . - That guy is why we 're in here ! He got us this far , we owe him . - I 'm not going back in there . - They 'll kill him ! - Yeah , well ... - They 're after his daughter . He 's just trying to protect her . He is the one person who can take them down . This is our only shot to get our lives back . I don 't have a life . Hey , you 're always talking about how you want to die , yet you fight like hell to stay alive . Some part of you wants to live , and for that , we need Bennet ! That went better than I expected . Ma ? Where is he ? He 's gone , Nathan . He isn 't supposed to die this way . He 's not supposed to die this way . He was wrong . What do we do ? We hide it . What ? 'Till after the election . Last thing he would have wanted was to bring you down with him . Why does it matter anymore ? Peter 's dead . I 'm not having this conversation . I know you don 't want me here . I just want to see him . I came all this way . Let the girl have her moment . I didn 't even get to know you . You 're the only one that made me feel safe . I thought you were like me . You saved my life . Guess we 're even now . What do you do with something that killed you ? You could put it underneath your pillow . I don 't know what I would have done . Don 't think about it . - I didn 't die . - Yeah , but if you had ... I don 't know who I am without you . Of course you do , you 're Nathan Petrelli . Top of his class , valedictorian , most likely to ... You 're that guy with me or without me . Who 's to say I 'm not all that because of you ? Most of what we are is what people expect us to be . I mean , if you take them away , nothing means anything . It 's a good thing I can 't die then . - What ? - Oh , I got that from Claire . She can regenerate . No matter what happens ? I think so . What about that painting ? You explode . If that happened , you could survive it ? Doesn 't really matter , does it ? Think about it for a minute . If I go nuclear ... if I blow up New York , do you know how many people are gonna die ? .07 % . Talk to her , Nathan . She wants to know her father . I can 't deal with that right now . She 's not just some girl , she 's your daughter . You know that Mom wants to send her to Paris ? You can 't let her go ! Don 't you get it ? Claire 's the girl that I saved ... in Texas . - Save the cheerleader ... - save the world . I get it . And she turns out to be your daughter ... your daughter ! Look around . Everything I said is happening , is happening now . It 's real . Maybe if Claire 's here , I don 't blow up . Maybe she 's here to save us . Talk to her , Nathan . We need her . About what just happened , Nathan and I need to talk to you . It 's okay , I know . I knew long before either of you did . I recommend the cherry pie . Shouldn 't we keep a lower profile ? They won 't come after us in a public place . - They wouldn 't risk it . - How can you be so sure ? Point taken . Eat up . It 's a long road ahead . Forget it , I 'm getting the hell out of here . They will find you . As long as they have that tracking system , you 'll never be safe . Neither will Claire . Look ... the system is well-protected , but we can get to it , destroy it . No more bagging and tagging . No more looking over your shoulder . We can end it all . Where is this tracking system ? New York City . We 're leaving on the next bus . Is this where Linderman is ? Where did you get that name ? From your boss , Thompson . He was thinking about sending us to go see Linderman . I just figured that must be who you 're working for . Wait a minute ... You didn 't know that ? You 're trying to take down your organization , you don 't even know who signs your checks ? My God ! - You 're middle management ! - So what 's that supposed to mean ? What it means is he 's a schlub , just like the rest of us . Linderman isn 't in New York . He 's in Las Vegas . So this is really Linderman Linderman , the mobster who owns all those casinos ? - What does he have to do with all this ? - Apparently more than I knew . I say we go to Vegas . We take the fight to Linderman . We stick with the plan . We take out the tracking system . And then whoever 's left standing can go after Linderman . New York . I 've always wanted to go . You boys ready to order ? But why 'd you have to pick me up so early today from school ? Today 's a special day . Mom ? The man we 're gonna meet , well , let 's just say he changes all the rules . And he wants to meet me ? He knows that you do the most amazing things . I told him he doesn 't know the half of it . My son the genius . So I don 't have to pretend about what we can do , like dad said ? That 's all right , gentlemen . I want to greet this young man myself . It 's a great pleasure to meet you , Micah . Thank you . How would you like to save the world today ? Cute car . You know why Peter Petrelli came here ? He wanted my help . Instead , I got him killed . You did the right thing calling us . I tried to stop Sylar ... but I couldn 't . I 'm a scientist . I can 't fight someone who defies the laws of physics . You can . You just need help . You 're not the one I called . Glasses , tall fella ? He 's no longer with the company . You know , you 've been going about this all wrong , Professor . Trying to take on the science and the killer all on your own ? What you 're dealing with , no man should face without friends . Now , we can provide you with the resources ... I didn 't call about my research . The man who murdered my father and Peter Petrelli is still out there . That takes precedence over any academics . A person that dangerous must be stopped . I can assure you we have similar priorities . The best way to stop Sylar is for us to work together . You really can paint the future . Just like the professor said . Fantastic . You 're late . I guess you know why I 'm here . You 're the one who 's gonna kill me . That 's true . This is usually the part when people start screaming . I tried fighting the future . It 's too big for me . Maybe you can do better . Why me ? Do you see some special future for me ? They stop you ... and you die . You painted all that too ? Show me . Show me ! Now , now . It 's already gone . Why don 't you tell me all about it then ? I 've seen enough of the future . I don 't need to watch it happen . I 've wasted my life , destroyed everything good that ever came to me . At least I did one good thing before I died . You can 't fight the future . Neither can you . It 's all right . I finally know my part in all of this . To die here with you . But not before I show them how to kill you ... and stop the bomb . I finally get to be a hero . Your mom said you wanted to talk to me . I did ... I do . Come in , please . This should have happened a long time ago , under better circumstances . It shouldn 't take someone nearly dying for the two of us to finally meet . You know , you don 't have to do this ... pretend to be nice to me . I 'm not pretending . Claire , most people ... they think the worst of me , and I 've probably given them good reason to . But I want to do better . I want to be there for you . But I can 't . Not now . Of course . I 'm sorry , but there are things happening right now that I can 't expect you to understand . I barely understand them myself . I got into politics for the chance to ... do something good . I have a chance to help . To be a part of something big . - But in order to do that , I have ... - The election . You can 't have some illegitimate daughter popping up and waving at the cameras . I need to win . You need me to leave . Paris , with my grandmother . She warms up . Sort of . It 's just one week . And then what ? And then you come home to your family . Okay ? You ! Me ?

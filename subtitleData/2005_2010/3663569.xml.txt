Source of a report of destruction in Kuberstan of a 1000 year old convent .. One of the oldest continuously functioning convents in Central Asia . Now occupied by an assetic branch of noelite The convent was strucked by a missile late last night There were no survivors . An initial reaction from the Noelite . It is a tragedy to think that even defenseless women who make the choice to withdraw from society and lead a life of purity suffer the attacks from terrorists who have no respect for the lives of decent god-fearing people . We shall mourn our sisters . The Noelites has been persecuted too long Tomorrow will be the dawn of our new age Congratulations , my friend . You made it safe and sound . - Gorsky . Did you destroyed the convent ? - I am not a terrorist , Toorop I am a mercenary like you . - Bullshit What the hell is going on ? You done your job , when you turn over the girl I 'll get paid and your home free . And that tracking device in your passport will be deactivated . Deliver the package , my men will be there to be sure you do They never hurt anybody Maybe it was an accident . - It was not an accident . It was destroyed right after we crossed the border . Would you like to pray with me ? I don 't feel like prayinmg anymore . Toorop said I am just a package to him . Is that all I am to you ? Of course not , I love you . How is she ? Scared . I wish she should be . Who are they ? To the left the range rover going work for your sect , the Noelites To the right , the bikers work for Gorsky . They 're all here to make sure I deliver And if we don 't ? It 's gonna be a free fall . Look sister . We traveled 6 thousand miles together . The truth is that this has been a suicide mission from the beginning They won 't let either one of use walk out here alive . The doctor that came to the convent 3 months ago . Answer the door , act with nothing is wrong . OK Good Eveningt sister . - Good Evening . Good Evening Where is she ? - In the room . You are a bad man . Thank you Aurora . Thank you so much . How is she ? - She 's fine . I have to run more tests . - More tests ? You just run a test . What is wrong with her ? I expect a call from my client - What is wrong with her ? Toorop let him go . If you , Please . Thank you , sister . Get over here . - What is wrong with you ? I want to know everything that you know Don 't you think that if I knew anything , I will tell you ? No , I don 't think . You 're a Noelite , you are like him , you swore an oath . Not to them , to God . God has nothing to do with it now . You understand , if she 's carrying a virus she can annihilate half the city . and I am not gonna have it on my conscience . I 'm pregnant , twins . It is not possible , I watched over you all your life . No one has ever touched you . And nobody has . It 's a miracle . Shit . Hello ? Mr. Toorop ? This is the high priestess - I know who you are . Thank you for doing such a good job , Mr.Toorop. You 're welcome Bring the girl to the limousine and you will be free . Toorop , if you deliver me to them , I 'll die . One of the way out We can 't let her go , Toorop Look around , do we have a choice ? She 's your problem now . Move ! We will go into the subway . - Thank you , Toorop . What 's wrong ? It 's a missile link to my passport . How can you stop it ? Only by death . We 're going to the subway . Toorop It 's you . Protect them . I need you to live . Aurora was our miracle . A true virgin birth . This was to make our the dominant religion of the world . Now we don 't know what happened to her . In this mess , there 's no sign of Aurora . We can 't find her . We 're finally on a verge of becoming a bonafide religion . and your incompetence has thrown 20 years of careful planning down the tubes . Who gave the order to use guns to retrieve her ? You left Gorsky no choice , What were you thinking ? Your Highness . - What ? The body stolen from the morgue was Toorop they found the van that transported him to New Jersey Who would want to abduct the body of a dead man ? He is back on line . Where are you taking me ? Mr. Toorop is not a prisoner , you can release him . Good evening , Mr. Toorop . I 'm Dr. Darquandier , Aurora 's father . I thought you were dead . Sometimes it is useful to be dead if the last one has the second chance .. You 'll see . Oh yes , you were clinically dead for two hours We lost quite a bit of time getting you from the morgue . And then you went into a coma for 5 days . I fixed you up as best I could . Now , Mr. Toorop , I believe I owe you some explanation . You see , 20 years ago , I was drummed out of the medical profession for trying to implant human babies with artificial intelligence . Around that time , the Noelites came to me to create smartest , stronger , healthier human beings .. So I built a super computer to be Aurora 's artificial mother .. As a fetus Aurora learned to process information just like a computer . Until she was born , she became much more than just an experiment you see , she became .. she became my daughter . She was beautiful , she was unique , and I couldn 't bring myself to give her away . That 's when they hired Gorsky to kill me and .. well , they almost suceeded . He took my baby away and hid her from the Noelites , I searched for her for years , but I couldn 't find her . I knew , that one day the Noelites would have to present a miracle to the rest of the world . What do you want from me ? I want you to find my daughter We think she is still alive . And that she 's left you a message , you died with your eyes open . but your brain recorded more than you can actually remember . we just need to rewind the tape . You need to return to the same condition when we 'd have found you . Almost dead ? Quite . What am I looking for ? What you missed the first time . We 'll guide your memory with our computer . Are you ready , Mr. Toorop ? Stay with the memory . Move forward a little bit . Focus on his memories of Aurora . We are going to be seeing her . very good . That 's right , We are getting there . Now good , focus on his gun . Easy , easy , steady steady . He 's way past the danger threshold I know , but he 'll be fine . He 'll be fine OK , slow down , slow down now . Slow down . Let 's wait , let 's wait ... I need you to live . He 's dead Wait , don 't bring him back yet . He 's almost there . Go home . Alright , alright . you 're back , you 're safe .. I know where she is . Mr. Gorsky . , I hoped I wouldn 't have to see you again . Where is my Money ? You still haven 't paid me . You have an odd way of killing people . What are you talking about ? I am on my way to see our old friend Darquandier Impossible , I made his car explode myself . Mr. Gorsky when I kill , I kill for good . Are you threatening me ? - Blessed your soul . you 'll need a nuke to kill me . Beef . How did you survived the blast ? it 's the babies you see ... .. I gave ' em power , they are the one guiding her . The rescue for survival is greater than anything we could have ever imagined . Professor , your wife is found . she 'll be here in two minutes . Find the door opened , you 're the only that can save her now . So where we go ? North . Hello my dear , it 's lovely to see you . - Where is my daughter ? I see you haven 't found her . And you never will . you selfish bastard .. 20 years ago I gave you the opportunity you wanted . Now it 's my turn . Where is my daughter ? - She 's not your daughter . She comes from me . - I designed her . For me , she 's my miracle , she belongs to my church . Your church is a lie . you 're paying miracles for your own profits .. Are you willing to die for her ? - Yes . Find Toorop . He knows where she is . Wait here . You 're finally home . - What 's left of it . But I came back for you . Have a little faith . Toorop , they are coming . Quick left . Toorop , they need help . Take the wheel ... Toorop . Thank you For protecting us . You 're their father now . Aurora That 's the first time you said my name . You 're gonna be OK . Take care of them , Toorop . Hey kids ... There is a storm coming , we need to go Ready ? - OK , Dad .

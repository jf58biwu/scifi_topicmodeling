 Hey Finn . Finn ! Azerin . Wake up , we jumped ! We 're almost home . Azerin ? What ... Another empty well . - Wanna dig another ? - Yeah , of course . - He wouldn 't give up on me . - You got it . Is this crazy ? Yeah ... I 'm sorry , but yeah . But look , he would give up on you . Eventually , if it didn 't make sense anymore , he 'd have to . He 'd understand . You wanna go home ? Yeah . You stripped the pliers ! I didn 't think he 'd hand them to her , but it didn 't make a difference . You injected Brooks with my morpha ! He started to wake up when I took it and put it back , but you trusted me ! - No , no ! You killed them all ! - We needed the air . - No ! Gods . What ... - Felix . I picked you ... over my own kind ... over my own model . I protected you from something you never could have done but you were thinking all along . I couldn 't . I wouldn 't . No one could ! That is not true . There is a fine line between ignorance and hope . I would have thought you 'd have learned that by now . - What are you talking about ? - Felix ! You have to open your eyes . You have to see what the world is really like ! You gave me the names , Felix ! The rest was easy . Kill everyone on this list .

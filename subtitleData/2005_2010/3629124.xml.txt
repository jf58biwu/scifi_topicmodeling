 There 's Only One Sun Light ... Dark ... Light ... Dark ... When you say it I can almost feel it . Read it for me . It just rained . Green lights are shining in the water . Green ? I remember red . Did they change them ? They did . When did you go blind ? A year ago . How did it happen ? I saw something I shouldn 't have . He probably had a name once , but no one knows it now . His codename is " Light . " From today on , you are blind . He 's paranoid about people recognizing his face . This Lightcatcher will lead you to him . Keep the signal on at all times . We wouldn 't want to lose you . That day , they showed me the only image of him in existence . I 'm Agent 006 of the Central Authorities , Human Sanitation Department . We remove pepole . With the Lightcatcher , I could feel his presence everywhere , but no signal was strong enough to reach him . A woman in your condition shouldn 't be alone . It 's dangerous . I don 't mind . The danger or the loneliness ? I don 't care . Neither do I. Will you do it ? Anything . Anything to keep us together . The plan was to cross the border . We needed permits . I managed to get two . But I wasn 't sure . At the border , I told him I had one . Only one of us could make it . That 's how he wanted it to end . Maybe it would have been better that way . But that night , I shot first . One year ago I saw samething I shouldn 't have . I saw him as a young man . He was beautiful . It 's hard to look at things directly . They 're too bright and too dark . Sometimes we need to see things through a screen . On one side of the screen , memories fade . On the other , they glow forever . Afterwards , they tried to remove Light from my memory . But I can still feel his warmth . There 's only one sun , but it travels the world every day . This sun is all mine and I won 't ever give it away ! Marina Tsvetaeva

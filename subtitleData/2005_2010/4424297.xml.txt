 I was just doing that same thing . Look at her pliers . Insulating grip has been stripped off . Who did this ? Old as frak . Grip wore off . Or someone didn 't like the idea of a machine breathing their air . Those were mine . - I was supposed to get killed . - Unless you did it . - I mean , you didn 't notice bare metal ? - What ? What are you saying guys ? We 're using up air . - Are you accusing me ? - Shut the frak up ! It was an accident . What are we gonna do with her ? Jettison her . We have to . We can pull air into our tanks and open the door . - We 'd lose air . - Only a little . She 's gonna start giving off methane and hydrogen sulfide . No . She 's right . We gotta get rid of the body and then we can figure out what to do next . Flight suits . Give me that . I 've an idea how to get us home , - but I need your help . - What do you mean ? I 'll tell you when they 're asleep . Trust me , okay ? This list ... Some of these people I haven 't seen in a long time . They may already be ... Gods . The Ones , they keep good records . If somebody 's locked up , I can find them . And get them out . We can do this . Really . Buckle in , Lt. Let 's go hunting .

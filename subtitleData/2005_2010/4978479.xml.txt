 Every child in the world is speaking English . We are coming . And one man . You 're pregnant . Have you told Rhys ? I 've only just found out myself . He is going to love that . We are coming . This morning it woke up . Transmitting on the 456 . It 's a transmission , a pulse , a broadcast . We are coming . You never tell me anything these days . Dad died , that was it . He is very handsome . You 're kidding me ? Really though ? We are coming . It might be best if certain historical events were taken off the record . You never told me . I was never a part of it . There 's a bomb in your stomach . Stop it ! Stop it ! We are coming . John ! There 'll be nothing left of you . I can survive anything . Back ! Whoa ! Whoa ! You can 't go back there , love . No , no , no , it 's too dangerous . My friend 's still in there . Go back to the ambulance . Walk as quick as you can , now . Let me go and get him . Let me go ! Let me go ! No ! Hold her down ! Control said no survivors . Aaagh ! Sorry , I 've got to take this . Work ? After what just happened ? Because of it . They 're OK now . Get yourselves to bed , girls . And don 't worry . Hello . Target one 's eliminated . Two and three have escaped , but we 're in pursuit . What went wrong ? They got lucky . But they won 't get far . We can 't have witnesses . " Call me when you 've got them . " And make it quick ! " Off to bed . I 've got the translations . Instructions . Specifications for something they want us to build . And we haven 't got much time to do it in . When they can communicate like this , in this kind of detail , why do the thing with the children ? Because they can . And because they want to scare us . Who do you work for ? Who do you work for ? The NHS . Who do you work for ? ! You tried to kill me . My friends could be dead . So don 't think I won 't use this . I 'm working for the government . I just follow orders , that 's all . We 're on the same side ? Why would the government want to destroy Torchwood ? Why ? I just do as I 'm told . I 'm just following orders , that 's all . " Please come in . " Jackson , keep the police back . You , come with me . If she 's anti-terrorist , I would not mind being Uncle Terrorist . Get some back up . Two escaped suspects . Ianto Jones , Gwen Cooper . Armed and dangerous . I know Gwen Cooper . She 's an ex-police officer , she 's not a terrorist . Haven 't you got tape to tie ? Fine , I 'm just saying . You 're barking up the wrong tree , that 's all . I want their homes raided . Gwen Cooper is not a terrorist . You must know where she lives . Get up ! Now ! We 've got to go ! Bloody hell , Gwen ! We 've to get out of here . What 's going on , man ? Listen , someone is trying to kill me . And if they 're after me , they 're going to come after you . Now get up , and get dressed ! What ? Come on Rhys , faster , faster ! All right , all right . Down to the bottom , take a left . I mean , shouldn 't there be some sort of briefing first ? Like a risk assessment ? Not that Gwen 's a risk . Rhys , car keys ? Try the top of the fridge , I think . I 've tried on the top of the bloody fridge , man ! Come on ! If you put the keys in the same place all the time we wouldn 't have to go through this time and time again ! What are you doing ? Packing . You 're not going to have time to read ! And they can trace us with that ! Well , I 've not gone into hiding before ! So , er , you lot are some sort of specialists from London . Am I right ? I mean , I totally respect that . Really I do . But sometimes , there 's no substitute for a little bit of local knowledge . And let me tell you , Gwen 'll be absolutely no bother . We 're not going in there all guns blazing , are we ? How far is it ? Two minutes . Come on , come on ... Come on . No ! Rhys ! Rhys ! Hello . Jesus Christ , Rhys ! It 's Ianto , right ? Christ 's sake , man ! Ianto , are you OK ? Yeah , have you heard from Jack ? No . No I haven 't . Sorry , hang on . Do you think he survived ? He usually does . " Who was it ? " I had a run-in with one of them . Said he was working for the government . That doesn 't make sense . How did they get close enough to plant it inside him , Ianto ? It was him , that Dr Rupesh . He was shot and killed in the hospital earlier . " It must 've been then . " Let 's go . Take the bag . Get the car ready . Er , where shall we meet , Ianto ? Your phone , your phone could be bugged . Erm , right ... Er ... Remember the last time we had ice cream together ? No . Yeah , you do . After the Grand Slam . I don 't like ice cream . It gives me a headache . I 've got to go . Gwen ! Go ! Now do you believe she 's a terrorist ? She shot the wheels . What kind of terrorist shoots your wheels ? A clever one . Right . I think ... we made it . Let 's go . Where ? Can 't we just take a minute ? Just to ... Number plate recognition . They can trace us . We need to ditch it . It 's a brand new car ! It 's no good to us now , OK ? We need to keep moving . Wouldn 't it be better if we gave ourselves up ? When I know what 's happened , I 'll tell someone . Until then , we 're going underground . Let me carry the bag . You want your trigger finger free , don 't you ? We 're looking for Ianto Jones . Don 't move ! Don 't move ! We 're looking for Ianto Jones . Well , you won 't find him in my bed , will you ? ! I 'm a married man . What ? Keep your phones on today . Why ? I want to be able to speak to you . Since when ? Since we were possessed by the Devil . I 'm serious . If they go off during a lesson , we can 't get them back till Friday . Keep them on mute . Every suspicious phone call , every time you come home late , you hide behind the Official Secrets Act . And I put up with it . Don 't start on this . Not now . I accept it . But this is different . When it affects my kids , in my house . There is nothing to worry about . I saw how scared you were last night . I know . It 's frightening to see it first hand , there 's no lasting damage . It 's quickly over . This isn 't a hula hoop craze . It happened to Brian and Wendy 's kids in Canada . You don 't think this is over any more than I do . Just make sure they keep their phones on . And don 't let them come home on their own . I 'm off now , girls . I 'll see you . Goodbye kisses , it must be serious . If you could get out of bed at a proper time , you 'd get plenty of kisses . Have a good day . Dad ? What ? We want a pony . We want a pony . We want a pony . See ? Nothing to worry about . " Latest headlines . " Further reports are coming in about the explosion in Cardiff last night . " No organisation has yet claimed responsibility for the explosion , " which went off in the Bay area of the city ... " Isn 't that where Uncle Jack lives ? It 's a big place . Shh ! " Casualty figures remain low , with two people reported missing . " " Residents in Cardiff are reacting with shock and outrage . " The entire bay area has been closed off and witnesses say the effects " of the explosion last night could be felt five miles away . " No-one can say for sure why this area was the site of such an unexpected attack , " and the Prime Minister 's office has refused to speculate until more details are known . " Fortunately , the timing of the device ... " As you know , Harkness is a difficult man to kill . Current theories suggest that his longevity is connected in some way to the Torchwood Hub . Which necessitated taking out the entire operation . He can 't still be alive , after that . As I said , awaiting results . What about these , er ... these specifications ? From the 456 ? I could barely understand a word of them . Nor me . But I 'm told the translations are excellent . And they 've started work . Dekker 's called in the damage control team , they 're working as fast as they can . Early reports are looking , well , promising . Can we see it ? They 'll be ready to show us work in progress by 1600 hours . We 're building something and we don 't even know what it is . Can I ask ? Did the 456 contact any other country ? Intel 's been listening . No chatter on the wires . Seems like it 's only Britain . And how long can we keep it secret ? Given the children 's last statement , " We are coming back " . That 's what everyone seems to be asking - when were they here before ? Yes . Well , if that 's everything ... Sir . Sir , I 'd just , um ... I just wanted to say how ... grateful I am , sir . What for ? Well . I know that I 'm something of a middleman in these affairs , but um ... I just wanted to thank you , for trusting me with the responsibility . All I 've done is put you on the front line . That 's what the front line 's for , John . First to fall . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Come on , check the gas is turned off . Get some breathing equipment down here . Hang on ! Stop ! I 've got something ! Hello ? If you can hear me , clench your hand . It 's not a body . It 's just the arm . " This is Jack Harkness . Leave a message and I 'll get back to you . " It 's me . Call me . When you get a chance . Mum , there 's no toothpaste . Everything OK ? Yeah . They 're expecting us , the car 's waiting . Well , come on then . Hello ? We thought there was a body , but we 've got an arm , a shoulder and the remains of a head . It 's almost a waste of a body bag . Is it Harkness ? Presumably . Take him to Ashton Down . Keep him under surveillance . Sorry , sir , I couldn 't help hearing . That name . Harkness . Is that Captain Jack Harkness ? From Torchwood ? Only he was trying to contact you yesterday . I did mark it in the log . Said he could help . Not now , he can 't . Are you sure ? He was very insistent . He told me his team were the experts at dealing with things like the children thing . He told you that ? Over the phone ? Yes . He always was an arrogant sod . So , he can 't help ? He 's not really the expert ? That bomb in Cardiff last night . He was the one at the centre of it . It tore him to shreds . Does that mean whoever 's behind the bomb 's behind the children thing ? Like they wanted him out of the way ? Lois , your job - you don 't overhear phone calls . You speak when you 're spoken to . OK ? Sorry . Thanks , mate . It 'll be from Uncle Ianto . Ssh ! We 're probably bugged . Innocent kids , fast asleep at home , and a gang of uniformed thugs break in and point guns at their head ? It 's no wonder they 're traumatised . It 's no wonder our poor David pissed the bed . I didn 't . Ha , you big baby ! It 's the police state to blame , and I 'm going to rinse the bastards for every penny they 've got ! Oh , shut up , Johnny ! What 's he done ? Why 's he bringing it to our door ? Hey , hey . We 're the only family he 's got . Put it in here . Come on , come on ! No . They 've frozen mine , as well ! Shit ! What now ? How 're we going to manage without money , Gwen ? We need to get to London . London ? Everything 's dearer in London ! That 's where all the decisions are made . Whoever wants us dead , that 's where they 'll be . Right . So where we should be is John O 'Groats ! I need to speak to people , but I haven 't got anybody 's numbers any more . So we 've got to go there , OK ? These things are all linked . Soon as you put your card in , bells start ringing somewhere . Come on . Any change ? No . Complete waste of time . The body next door , Rupesh Patanjali , London wants to know if it 's OK to release him to the family . Zip it open . It was a bag of bits when it came in . And I asked you to keep an eye on it . Get it out of that thing and cuff it to the wall . Hello . The good news is , we don 't have to wait for the DNA tests . This is definitely Jack Harkness . And what 's the bad news ? His Lazarus qualities remain undiminished . Jesus Christ ! " If he can survive that , what can 't he survive ? " I haven 't got time to worry about this , Johnson . I 've got more important things in my in-tray . What about Cooper and Jones ? No sign of him yet . We 've had a sighting of her at a Cardiff ATM . We need that whole team out of the way by tonight . Get it done . Wait out here . Now me , I use an electronic seal , see . Even the driver doesn 't know the code . No-one gets in until it reaches it 's destination . But this clown ... Sure he 's going to London ? I don 't question how you defend the world against extra terrestrial infiltration . Don 't you question my knowledge of the haulage industry . Sorry . It 's a small company , Gwen . Cardiff to London . Piss poor security . And best of all , guaranteed food cargo . I 'm absolutely bloody starving . The smell from Tony 's is driving me crackers . There is food . I can 't fault you on that . I 've got the smell of bacon in my nostrils , and I 'm looking at a lorry-load of raw spuds . There might be other things at the back . Come on . Have you got your pen knife ? Rhys , you are not eating uncooked potatoes ! We 'll need it to cut our way out . What kind of snoops are you ? Dibble or dole ? Dunno what you 're talking about . So you 're perverts , then ? Is it you making them do all the weird talking shit ? Everyone look , a couple of paedos on the estate ! We have observations in place . He 'd have been better off staying dead . Oh , God , this is uncomfortable . Bloody torture , man ! How are you , love ? My best friend 's belly had a bomb go off in it last night . Someone 's been trying to kill us . I 'm travelling at 70mph on top of potatoes , and I think I 'm going to be sick . Travel sick , is it ? When have you ever known me to be travel sick ? Well , when have you ever travelled like this ? On an empty stomach . What ? You know some announcements , you ... rehearse in your head ? Yeah . And this wasn 't ... quite what I had in mind . What do you mean , announcements ? Oh , God , no ! Yes . Bloody hell , no ! Yes . Oh , come here . Oh , my God ! I don 't believe it . Hang on ... The bomb , the guns , the car-chase , The hiding from the law . What am I like ? Letting you do all that in your condition ! You carried my bag . I 'm serious . This changes everything . No , it doesn 't . We 're up the same creek , and we still need a paddle . Yeah , but three of us in the boat . Hey . Oh , my God ! What happened to you ? I 'm not sure yet . I wasn 't followed . Sit down . You worked out my little code , then ? Dad didn 't break your leg on purpose , you know . He pushed me too hard . He always did . Well , you should 've held on tighter . Seriously . How did you get in that state ? That bomb . It was meant for me and the people I work with . My God ! Why ? I don 't know . What sort of civil servants are you ? Unappreciated ones . Are they OK ? The people you work with ? I don 't know . Gwen 's alive , but I 've just no way of contacting her . I 'm not sure about Jack . Is he your boss ? The one Susan saw you with ? He 'll be OK . They won 't get rid of him that easy . I just need to find him . If it 's a boy , Edward . Edward ? Yeah . After the king . Come on ! Out of the way ! Come on ! We are coming tomorrow . We are coming tomorrow . We are coming tomorrow . OK , I 'll tell him . It 's happened again . Shit . What did they say ? " We are coming tomorrow " . We are coming tomorrow . We are coming Tomorrow . We are coming tomorrow ... We are coming tomorrow . We are ... This has something to do with it . It must do . When they tried to blow us up , this is what we were working on . We are coming tomorrow . Tomorrow ? Over and over again . Are you sure ? Positive . Can you smell that ? They 're coming ! I can smell them . They 're coming ! Tomorrow , and they 'll be here . Hey , hey , hello . What did it feel like ? Leave her alone ! Go away ! They said the same thing here . Leave her alone . Piss off , you perv ! Yeah , OK , bye . It happened to David and Mica . What is it ? What is it ? I don 't know . But this is what we do . We deal with things like this . So deal with it . Stop it . I need to find Jack . Give me that . How will this help ? I took the number of the van they put him in . You can track any vehicle with the right computer programmes . Really ? Yeah . Give me the car keys . Oh , Johnny 'll do his nut ! Please ! We don 't have time to spare . A " thank you " would be nice ! Look , I 'm sorry . I 've got to go . Thanks for all this . Be careful ! Hold the line , please . Hello , I 'll put you on hold if that 's all right . Mr Frobisher will be back in a moment . I 'll have to put you on hold ... Hello ? " ' We are coming tomorrow ' , repeated in total 38 times . " Sorry , it 's chaotic here at the moment with the children thing ... " Reports confirm that every single child said the same thing . " Give me the name and I 'll look into it , and get back to you . Get my daughters on the phone . Ring the school office if you haveto . Then get me the Prime Minister . There 's a call waiting , sir . Take a message ! It 's the Home Secretary . And your wife wants you to call her . OK . Hello . John Frobisher 's office . Can I speak to Mr Frobisher , please ? He 's not available at the moment . Can I take a message ? It 's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood . I need to see him urgently . Can you set up a meeting ? Erm ... I 'm not sure . Just put me straight through , then . He 's very busy . Yeah , he would be ! Who is this ? Lois . Lois Habiba . What happened to Bridget Spears ? She 's on another line . " Do you know what Torchwood is , Lois ? " Yes . Then you should know that right now you lot need us . The whole world needs us . But someone 's trying to kill us . They claim to be working for the government . Why would the government want to kill people who can help ? That 's why I need to see him ! Look , I know all this sounds mad , but you have to believe me . I do . I do believe you . Hold the line , please . Call my wife . I 'm in a meeting with the PM . I 'll ring as soon as I can . I 'm putting the school through . Ah ! If you 're tracing this call ... I 'm not . So you can set up a meeting , then ? Lilly , is Holly there ? They 're both all right ? Are you sure ? Yes . The Prime Minister 's on his way . He 'll be there in ten minutes . OK , thanks . Ring ahead , let them know we 're coming . Right . Simon , we 're going back to Thames House . Can we trust this guy ? He 's our man in the government . If we can 't , we really are in trouble . Gwen , we really are in trouble ! We 've got to trust someone , Rhys , OK ? Hi . I 'm Lois . Where 's Frobisher ? He 's not coming . Why not ? Oh , God , this is probably the worst mistake of my life . I 've read your files . Some of the stuff you 've done , you 're like unsung national heroes . Listen , I don 't do autographs and I don 't want to be rude , but why am I talking to you and not your boss ? Because if he knew you were here you 'd be dead . He gave the order to have Jack Harkness killed . Are you sure ? I 've seen it with my own eyes . We really are in trouble . Do you know a Captain Andrew Staines ? No . A Colonel Michael Sanders ? Ellen Hunt ? No . They 're all dead . They were killed on the same day as Jack Harkness . I didn 't sign the Official Secrets Act to cover up murder . But then , I didn 't take the job to commit treason on my second day . What am I doing here ? You tell me , Lois . If you 're the bad guys , why doesn 't it say that on your file ? And if you 're the good guys , who am I working for , and why do they want you dead ? Listen , this a lot to talk about . And we 're going to arouse suspicion . And we haven 't ordered . When we went on the run , we didn 't have any money , see ? We put the last of the coins into the phone boxto get through to you . So If there 's any chance you could , er ... Thank you . Oh , great . Thanks . That 's magic . I 'll have steak pie and chips . And a cup of tea . Just a latte for me . OK , I won 't be a sec . I 'll leave you to it . Thanks , we owe you one . A big one . Everyone in the office seems to think what 's happening with the kids is all to do with aliens . And that they 'll be here tomorrow . And there 's something big being built on the top floor of the MI5 building . OK , what do you mean something ? I don 't know . But it 's like they 're getting ready . And if you lot ... Torchwood ... if you 're the alien experts , and they really are coming tomorrow , why does Mr Frobisher want you out of the way all of a sudden ? I 've no idea . But I 'm going to find out . Can you tell me anything about Jack Harkness ? Or Ianto Jones ? Jones is missing . I 've been told Captain Harkness is dead . Well , that can 't be true . Well , that 's what I thought . I overheard Mr Frobisher say to keep him under surveillance . Why do that to a dead person ? Come on ! Who 's the genius behind the camera ? Come on , come on out and take your bow ! Show yourself ! Face me like a man ! I 'm not a man . Who are you ? What 's all this about ? Apparently you can 't die , so it would be foolish to tell you anything . But I will say this . If I can 't kill you I can contain you . Do you know where they 're keeping him ? I 've got a floor plan in my bag . Steak pie and chips , twice ? Oh , lovely , thank you . It 's , um ... it 's a military compound . Are you sure ? That 's where Mr Frobisher told them to take him . Salt ? Thanks . This is brilliant work , Lois . Can you ? Oh , thanks . The only problem is , how do we get inside ? Well , Mr Frobisher 's just authorised the release of a body from Ashton Down . This is Rupesh Patanjali . They must have thought he was one of us . The undertaker 's name is Richard Rossiter and he 's got an appointment to pick him up at 5.30 today . I was thinking , access to a funeral director would be easier than access to a secure military compound . So ... He 'd have to pass through here at some time between 5 and 5.15 to get to Ashton Down for 5.30 , and there 'd be no witnesses . The name of the contact at the compound is a Corporal Camara . His number 's on there , and he 'll be expecting you . Sugar ? I 'm a PA . It 's what I do . When this is all over , and you want a job , come and see me . I 'm sorry . I don 't suppose you 'll believe it . But this is all in the national interest . Prime Minister . Ready ? Let 's go . Have they sent us any further information ? Not since they sent us the designs for this thing . I 've got two radio operators working round the clock . We 're sending out continuous messages on the 456 wavelength , but we 're getting nothing back . Don 't mind me . What 's the latest from Jodrell Bank ? Any signs of their approach ? No . But then there wasn 't last time . What 's that for ? It 's for them . Hi , we 're here to pick up a body . 5.30 appointment . Corporal Camara ? Kodak 's dead ! ? When did that happen ? No , he 's the contact . The name of the deceased is Patanjali . Rupesh Patanjali . Jesus ! Shit meself then ! He owes me money . Sorry . I 'll have to look in the back . Kodak , got a couple of body-snatchers down at the gate for you , over . OK , let ' em in . Over . We 're not going to get away with this . You really shouldn 't be here , Rhys . I shouldn 't ? ! Hello ? ! If Jack needs carrying , you 're going to need me here . See that fire exit ? Do you wanna back up to that ? Save you having to wheel him round the block . OK . So there 's an upside to this place being turned into a mortuary all of a sudden . So you don 't get many bodies , then ? Not usually . But we 've got in three at the moment . Do I know you ? No , I don 't think so . You don 't look like an undertaker . If more undertaker 's looked like you , there 'd be more of a demand for bereavement . Ooh , ooh , hang on . I 'm just going to open the fire door for your mate . Corporal Camara at the west corridor . I 'm just opening the fire door for the body-snatchers . OK ? OK . She 's shy , isn 't she ? I just prefer the company of dead people . Is she seeing anyone ? She 's married . Married and pregnant , so you can forget it , mate , right ? You 're a couple , aren 't you ? No offence . You can 't blame a man for trying . Do you want to check this is the right one ? Yeah . Corporal Camara ? Yeah . Everything OK ? The camera 's not working . Yeah . Just checking the paperwork . No problem . What 's going ? I 've lost two cameras now . That 's the one . Come on . Intruders . Two of , west corridor . Intruders , two of , west corridor . Shit . Leave it , Rhys . Out the way ! What the hell is that ? Move ! Move ! Move ! Positions . We 'll have to surrender . I 'd lay down your weapons , if I were you . You 're as trapped and helpless as the man in the concrete cell . Put the guns down ! OK . Run ! Positions . Come on ! Positions . Come on , get on . Ah , Ianto . You took your time . Come on . Come on ! Move it ! Take your positions . They 're going to catch up . Rhys , get out and move that truck . Hold on tight . Move , Rhys ! Come on . We 've got a problem . Cooper and Jones stalled us at a roadblock . How did that happen ? I 'm sorry . There 's a chopper on the way , but they 've got a head start on us . If he talks , we 're in deep , deep shit . I 'll have to call you back . Where the hell are you taking us , Ianto ? What are we doing ? You 'll see . Get the car started ! We 've only got a few minutes . Come on ! Told you I 'd be back . With a little help from us . What the hell is going on ? Dunno yet , but the latest from the kids is that it 's happening tomorrow . I 'm just in time , then . Get in the car . Come on , we 've got work to do . " ... United Nations has issued a statement asking parents and guardians of children ... " " ... still remains why every child in the world is giving their statements in English ... " " ... no theories as to why and how ... " " The focus now is on tomorrow . " With every child in the world claiming that tomorrow is the day , the world is left wondering . " Mr Frobisher , sir . Seals locked and release . As per the 456 instructions . A combination of 25 % nitrosyl chloride , 22 % hydrogen chloride , 20 % nitrogen , 12 % fluorine , 9 % hydrogen cyanide , 6 % acetone , 6 % phosgene . In short ... poison . I 'd hold on to your nose , Bridget ! Though , come to think of it , you 've been doing that for years . And that 's what they breathe ? Breathe ? Eat ? Fart ? We know nothing about them ! Excuse me , if we know the composition of that gas , can 't we work out what sort of creature could live inside it ? Could do . If we had all the time in the world ! So they arrive ... and then what ? The whole room 's laid out , according to 456 instructions . Something of an ambassadorial suite , I 'd say . Or a throne room . Who knows , maybe a slaughterhouse . But if they arrive tomorrow , then how ? How do they arrive inside that ? No idea . Who else knows about this ? For all we know , they 've sent the same instructions to every country in the world . We 've said nothing , maybe everyone else is keeping quiet , too . Oh , I don 't think so . Whoever they are , they 're coming for Britain . Well , why ? Exactly . Why is that , Mr Frobisher ? John Frobisher 's a good man . And better than that , he 's expendable . If anybody finds out what I 'm doing ... It 's treason ! You 're the only friend we 've got left , Lois . We are coming . We are coming . It 's them , it 's all of them - the kids . We are here .

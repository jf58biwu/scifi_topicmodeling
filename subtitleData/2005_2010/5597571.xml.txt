 How could he leave them there like that ? I wouldn 't want to guess . Trevor is a deranged individual . The fluid does that to them ? Look at that one . He seems alive . Lindze , to your right . That 's it ? An artificial world , sealed off from real life 's little irritations . You mean , like us . Quick and simple . We get Bargeld , and we get out . No distractions . I 'll be glad to get out of there . - With your eggheaded boyfriend . - He 's not an egghead . He 's just very inhibited . No time for tender reunions , Lindze . I know . Rats ! - What is it ? - My ammo 's gone . No time . Did you get that thing to work ? Get Bargeld , and we 'll rendezvous back here . Now ! Finally . Chairman Goodchild , just a note , in case you 'll be wondering . The fluid can be neutralised . I 'm going to do it . Put my few remaining hours to good use . The inmates will swim free . There 's nothing you can do about it , of course . Lindze ! What are you doing ? How did ... Bargeld , come on . Let 's go . Oh , no . No ! - What happened ? - Please . Don 't come any closer . It 's bad . I mixed some bad culture samples . - You shouldn 't have come . - Bargeld ? Just go ! I mean , I can 't go back now . Am I making sense ? Stay back ! Are you insane ? This is why I came . Lindze , don 't . It doesn 't matter . Aeon can take us . Oh , no ! Aeon . Aeon Flux can 't be allowed to disrupt ... the thread-fine symbiotic harmony that thrives here . You will subdue her for me , Number 16 ? The Republic 's tax dollars hard at work . Metal . No . What ... I can 't believe you got Aeon Flux involved in this . She only thinks of herself . That 's not true . - I know Aeon . She 's ... - She 's what , Lindze ? Think . What do you really know about Aeon Flux ? I could tell you some things . I was right . I hate that . She must have run into trouble . Your friend set the eradicator on us . Hurry ! Aeon ! Lindze . Lindze ? Bargeld ? Don 't bother with that . Our only chance is to get to a place where I can use ... Bargeld , don 't talk now . Aeon and I have a plan . Can 't you see it ? She 's just another variable . A cat loose in Trevor 's mouse maze . Aeon is trouble and nothing but . What the ... The fluid can be neutralised . I 'm going to do it . Put my few remaining hours to good use . The inmates will swim free . Lindze , enough fooling around . Let 's go . Your imagination has a gutter all its own , Aeon . Where 's Bargeld and Lindze ? Bargeld 's working for me . You 're not taking him anywhere . You don 't know where he is . I don 't . But he 'll come to me . He can 't escape , and neither can you . Your sub , I 'm afraid , is feeding the bottom . I 'm glad destroying things gives you such pleasure . It 's your vapid heroics that are contaminating ... my perfectly-balanced ecosystem . I don 't think I have the slightest idea how this thing works . Look , Aeon , I 've got a proposition for you . Go ahead , proposition me . Lindze , please . I can 't keep going . Take the neutraliser . Come on . We can do it . Which way now ? Down this vent . It comes out near my lab . I 'm finding my friends and going . You want to leave ? Fine . But not with the others . - Share reconstitution with me . - Reconstitution ? It 's the only way out . Let me show you . We melt our bodies together ... to form a single composite being that can pass through the fluid . Two minds , one body . Your little games always sound the same , Trevor . Well , think it over . At least let me rid you of ... These are what the insects want . Metal . All this time . All along . And I couldn 't see it . You were right , Bargeld . I hate her . Don 't be selfish , Aeon . Think about me for a change . I need a partner to escape , myself . We must melt . A dream can seem to last for hours ... and yet I awaken to find I have been sleeping only for a few minutes . The Habitat was my dream ... and soon it will be gone . Bargeld could save it , but he is dying . I could save Aeon ... but she will not come . Who will save me ? " Quick and simple . " No distractions , no tender reunions . " Goodbye , Aeon . Keep an eye on her while I neutralise the fluid . It 's not what you think , Lindze . I was late only because ... Because you couldn 't wait to sell us out to that sheepshearing visionary . You were right . Why did I trust her ? Lindze , what 's happened to you ? I mean , you look really sick . - We have to get you out of here . - Yes , and look at you . I figure I 'm doing everyone a favour , even Trevor . You 've got him eating out of your fingers . You don 't understand any of this , Lindze . You 're right . No , wait ! What is it ? - The key , it 's gone ! - What key ? It 's useless without it . Completely useless . I 've failed . Your key ? Shut up ! How dare you ! I know where your precious key is , Bargeld . - Aeon , the key ? - It 's a trick . She doesn 't know anything . Come on , Bargeld . We can still get to the submarine . The sub is gone . Trevor saw to that . And you , no doubt , helped him . - We don 't have time for this . - She 's right . All right . Take us to it . I can get there faster myself . - Come on . - I can 't . I 'm in a hurry ... so we won 't debate who tracked the mud into my brand new petri dish . What are you going to do with us ? I 'm going to cure you and get you out of here . This project is obviously at an end . I 'm sorry you have to see ... your life 's greatest achievement destroyed , Bargeld . Aeon Flux . If we go , what about you ? It takes two , right ? I 'm waiting for Aeon . What choice do we have ? It 's your decision , of course . But if you don 't do it , I guarantee you 'll be dead in five minutes . Let 's do it , Bargeld . Let 's go . Bargeld ! Oh , my God ! Lindze ? Bargeld ? Come on . If she isn 't here by now ... They say cats always land on their feet , but at this point there 's really no floor . Idiots .

 Surface ... Come on , Nim . Miles is forced to send Nimrod away . Go ... Nim . Congratulations . You have a police record . Dad hooked you up . Got you moved into a different community work area . ( announcer ) Lee stops at nothing to keep the species a secret . Turn here ! Turn , turn , turn , turn , turn ! ( Lee ) You couldn 't keep a tail on two civilians in a pickup truck ? Find them ! ( announcer ) Pursued by Lee and forced underground , they build their own submersible . ( Rich ) If Man went to the Moon in a tin can , we can do this . Emergency lifeboat . If you have to surface quickly , you flip this switch inside , the boat inflates . ( announcer ) They risked their lives to document the mysterious creatures and show the world . This is Dr. Laura Daughtery and Rich Connelly amidst a pod of the new vertebrates . ( announcer ) But something goes very wrong . What the hell ? Jackson , do you copy ? We are falling way too fast . You gotta pull us back up ! You gotta stop us . ( announcer ) Now Surface continues . Looks like they 've been here a little over a week . We just missed them . ( associate ) Where do you think they went ? Down . ( Rich ) Ah ! Hang onto something ! ( Daughtery ) Rich ? You 're bleeding . ( Rich ) We 're okay . We 're okay . We 'll be okay . [ mumbling ] This is where we 're supposed to be . We 're gonna die . This is where we 're supposed to be . Hey , Skinny ? Skinny ? You got a half-inch wire stripper for me ? What happened to the last pair I gave you ? ( Skinny , mumbling ) You 're a damned disgrace . He 's gonna cost me an arm and a leg . That 's what I get when I hire in-laws . Oh- - Where 'd you go ? Terrance ? Terrance ! Terrance ? Terrance ! Terrance ! Oh , my God . Paul , I want to thank you for coming down . Dr. Myers . This is Paul Blum from Fort Fisher Aquarium . Myers , here is our Charleston County coroner . How can I help ? Well , I 'm hoping you can identify the animal that did this . Um , the flesh is cut clean . Looks like a serrated edge to me . I was thinking , maybe a sand shark ? They don 't come this far up river very often . Some kind of cat ? A bobcat or Carolina panther maybe ? If it 's a panther , it 's the first one seen in this state in 50 years . Well , there 's also this- - ( Blum ) What is that ? His skin is charred . Is it chemical burns ? No , it 's electrical . Electric eel ? Hey , you ladies need to stay back . We have a rogue gator out here . ( officer # 2 ) I got something . I think they 're tracks . Tracks over here . Let 's get a cast of that before the tide comes in . Saw that at the mall . Thought you might want it for your collection . Thanks . I 'm sure Nim 's fine . He 's probably happier out in the wild . Yeah . No shrimp . Sea 's empty this season . Like something 's run everything off . What the hell is that ? Just gotta get this ... reserve battery to work ... since we have no lights . ( Daughtery ) No power . No life raft . We would 've been at the surface by now if you hadn 't stopped me , Rich . ( Rich , mumbling ) It 's okay . ( Daughtery ) The scrubber 's soaked . Wet soda-lime can 't absorb the CO2 . How long does that give us ? About ... 90 minutes . Less if more carbon monoxide gets in here . It might not seem like it now , but , we 're gonna be okay . [ softly ] Rich . Rich . Hey , listen to me . I 'm begging you to listen to me , okay ? I need you to help me out . You gotta--you gotta snap out of this , okay ? Please snap out of this . Rich . Rich ! We are going to die if you don 't help me now , okay ? Okay . What do I need to do ? You need to make that battery work . Where 's my ratchet ? Here . Okay . [ blows air ] All right . Easy . All right . Oh ! Power 's good . Power 's on . Okay . Okay , so the compressor is gonna inflate the life raft , and then we go up , okay ? Hang on , hang on . Wait , wait , wait . Hold onto something . Wait for what ? Just ' cause- - What 're we waiting for ? It 's- - I just wanna think it through for a second . 'Cause , you know- - Rich , there 's nothing to think about . Let 's just do this , okay ? Please ? Rich , we 're gonna go back to the surface . Okay ? Look at me . [ heavy sigh ] Okay ? Okay . Yeah , okay . Hold on . Okay . It 's not working . We gotta do it one more time . You ready ? Hold on . [ sobs ] Yeah , it 's not working . ( Jared ) Hey , Miles . Hey , don 't worry about the scrubbers right now . I need you to cover for me in Director Blum 's office . Okay . What 's up ? I 've gotta run these down to the sheriff 's office . An electrician got bitten yesterday in the marsh by some critter . Really ? Yep . Really . Killed him . [ makes ripping sound ] Ripped his throat out . What do they think did it ? ( Blum ) It 's a conundrum . Massive tissue lacerations like a shark attack , bizarre electrical burns . Yeah . Well , of course . No , the victim was in the shallows . Yeah , well , there wasn 't that much of the neck left , to be honest . Yeah . It 's , uh , got a footpad like a mammal . Long claws , webbed feet , like an otter or a seal . Yeah , I think I got time to make the last pickup . You 're the intern , right ? Yeah . I want you to ship this to David Howell in the zoology department at N.C. State , all right ? I want him to get a look at this . Yeah . Oh , man ... Maybe it was self-defense . Like , maybe they provoked it somehow . Shh . Tried to hurt it . You should 've seen the victim 's eyes . They were turned to jelly by the electrocution . ( Blum ) Yeah . Tomorrow morning , I 'm going to the fisheries . I 'm gonna examine the catches . I 'm gonna need you here at 7 : 30 tomorrow morning to help me with the specimen containers , all right ? Okay . I think the lifeboat 's just wedged or something . I 'm gonna check the radio . Maybe by some chance , Jackson can hear us . Where is it ? Where is it ? [ both panting ] Okay . Jackson ! Jackson ! S.O.S. , Jackson . Can you hear me ? Jackson ! Can you hear us ? Jackson ! Jac- - Uh , okay . ( Daughtery ) Okay , I just have to think . [ softly ] Oh , God , Jesse . ( Rich ) Don 't start doing that , okay ? It 's gonna be all right . You 're gonna be all right . You 're gonna see Jesse again . Just like I 'm gonna see Tracy . And my girls . And , uh , and my dog ... again . [ sighs ] I took this leap of faith , I got us down here , and I 'm tellin ' ya , George ain 't gonna let me down , okay ? Hear that , Georgia boy ? I need you . [ Nimrod bleating ] [ rustling and gurgling ] [ bleating louder ] Shut it . Son of a- - You want some of this ? You wanna live long enough for us to sell you , you better shut up ! I 'm gonna put you on ice . ( Daughtery ) About an hour left ... All right . .. little less . Just give me one more second , and I should have those lights up outside . We can get the lay of the land ... [ grunts ] [ whining ] Did you hear that ? ( Rich ) Almost ... there . Rich . Do you hear that ? Listen . Got it ! No , no , no , no . No , no , no . Uh ... Shut the lights off . Yeah . Off . Off . [ whispers ] I think we should keep the lights off . Me too . Did you see how many there were ? Yeah . You know , I also saw something else out there . ( Daughtery ) What ? Gave me an idea . If ... well , I thought- - I thought I saw a bait stick . It still had a live charge on it . Now , if we could somehow tilt this thing and detonate that charge , maybe it 'll- - maybe it 'll free up that life-raft . Okay . Worth a try . So ... Okay . You just- - Okay . [ grunts hard ] Come on ! Rich , stop ! Rich , stop , stop , hold on . We 're wasting air . Wasting air . [ grunts ] Wasting air , Rich . Wasting air . The air is running out . Only have 37 minutes left . What the hell ? ( Daughtery ) What ? There 's a man out here . What ? There 's a man out here on the ocean floor ! Look , come here ! ( Rich ) You see him ? Do you see him ? Huh ? Do you see him ? Don 't start freaking out on me , Rich . No , no , no , no . No , no . Where 'd he go ? Where 'd he go ? ( Miles ) So , before I shipped ' em , I took these . " His body was found early Saturday morning . " Authorities speculate that the animal might 've been an alligator . " [ scoffs ] Those are totally Nim 's feet , dude . You don 't know that . He 's got the taste of human blood and he 's on a spree . Nim is not on a spree . You 're problem is you think you speak Nim . You don 't speak Nim , no one speaks Nim , Nim 's a tiger . Tigers communicate . And what good did that do Roy , Hmm ? Siegfried and Roy ? Roy raised that tiger , dude . But sooner or later , the tiger grows up , and wild animal kicks in . [ scoffs ] This guy was food , dude . That was not Nim . You need to rat on the lizard . You saw the way police deal with this kind of thing . They 'll kill him . But I gotta get to him first . We trained him to come to the sound of the bell for food . So , if we broadcast the sound underwater , and loop it so it repeats over and over- - Dude , you can 't put my boom box in the water . We 'll waterproof it . Check it out . Aquaphonic speakers . Dad has ' em all around the pool . And track suit . Neck holes , doof . Hand holes ? Chip clips . You are the gadget master . All right , I gotta go meet Dr. Blum at the docks . Meet me back here at dusk . And take care of this . You got it . I can 't see a damn thing out there . This is Laura Daughtery , on board the submersible Little Heat . Our position is 41 ' 46 " North , [ slow breath ] 50 ' 14 " west . We are stranded at the bottom of the ocean , and we need immediate assistance . Jackson probably went for help by now . But the only DSRV on the West Coast is six hours away . [ garbled radio transmission ] Did you say something ? Hello ? Hello , do you hear me ? Can you hear me ? Is there anyone out there ? Please respond . What is that ? It 's not English . What is it ? Um , um , um ... [ speaking French ] There you go . There you go . Come on now . Keep it up , keep it up . Please respond . Please respond ! Do you hear us ? We 're trapped at the bottom of the ocean . We 're in a submersible ! [ foreign language on speaker ] What is that ? It 's , uh , it ain 't French . It 's Japanese or something . Yeah . Do you speak English ? Do you speak English ? Please , please respond . S.O.S. ! Mayday ! Mayday ! We are on the bottom of the ocean . Please , mayday . Mayday ! Please ! S.O.S. ! Oh , God . We have 30 minutes . It 's F.B.I. San Francisco SAC . I interfaced with Coast Guard , NOAA deep search . We did pick up a distress signal , actually . I 'm sending it to you over a secure line . ( Daughtery on recording ) Jackson ! S.O.S. , Jackson . Is that something you 're interested in ? Yes . Yes it is . Did you find any surface vessels in the area ? ( Lee ) Something that could launch a submersible ? Negative on the surface vessels . We 've had a lot of tough weather off the coast . Electrical storm . I 'm also looking for this man . Jackson Holden . ( Dawson ) All right . I 'll run a search . Put the name on the wire . Look , this distress signal , is this real ? Yes . I know the C.O. of the Reagan . I could get the DSRV . No , no rescue efforts . You destroy that sound file . What sort of bycatch are you looking for ? It kinda falls under the category of I 'll know it when I see it . Well , you 're welcome to take a look . But all the nets got excluders and BRDs . Cuts the incidentals in half . You notice anything strange about this spot ? Looks kind of scrawny . That 's right . It 's starving . See the flattened belly profile ? And the down-turned head , and the reddened mouth ? That means it 's feeding off the bottom . Where 'd all his food go ? I have no idea . Six months ago , all our indicators species-wide just spiked in the wrong direction . Hey . Yeah ? Anything out of the ordinary comes in here , I 'd appreciate you letting me know . You might wanna talk to the sports-fishing guy . Heard some crazy stories about the mackerel run . [ Fisherman speaking Spanish ] Ay ! Dios mio ! Big flash , it was like lightning in the water . And the King floated up . Dead on the line . ( Blum ) Lightning in the water ? Yeah . How long ago did this happen ? Yesterday . 6 : 09 am . You have a good memory . Memory 's not it . Stopped my watch cold . [ fisherman speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] Bite marks are deep . Reminiscent again of the former electrical burns . More of them , much more than the previous victim . This thing travels in packs . I 'll tell him . Sheriff just called . He said some guys down at Cape Fear caught our predator . What ? How did they catch him ? Apparently with bullets . ( officer # 1 ) It 's gotta be 15 feet long . ( officer # 2 ) Biggest gator I 've ever seen , Sheriff . Huge . Hey , Paul ! Watch your step . Careful , guys . Listen , thanks for coming down . I 'm sorry to have taken you away from your dinner . Look at this . You won 't believe this . Snuck right up on a couple of guys in that blind , fired both barrels each into its head . ( Sheriff ) Give us a hand , would ya , buddy ? ( Blum ) May I ? Thank you . This gator hasn 't eaten in three days . He 's not our predator . You sure ? I 'm telling you , what we 're looking for is not indigenous . All right , Paul . Then what is it ? I don 't know . I think we 're looking for an alien species . Alien-Australia . Alien-China . ( Sheriff ) Well then , we 'll just , uh , sound the horn , post a reward . Get some eyes in the water . Wait a minute , you don 't even know what you 're looking for . The last thing you need is a bunch of hotheads chumming the water , killing everything in sight . ( Sheriff ) The last thing I need is another somebody else getting hurt . I 'm gonna charter a boat with some professional fisherman who know how to handle these things . Yeah , " handle " . ( Sheriff ) That 's right . Eli ! Lalo ! ( captain ) The Hold ! I 'm on it , cap 'n . Lalo ! Hold ! Now ! Yeah ! Crap . Hey , how can it be so hot ? That thing . When Jesse was about three , we had this talk about life and death and ... God . And so I told him , I didn 't know who or what God was , or ... I said , maybe ... that he was all around us , in nature , in the air we breathe . So he took off his shoe , hands it to me , and there 's an ant . Smashed . Dead , on the bottom of his shoe . And he leans into me and he says , " Mommy , I smushed God . " And I say , an ant 's okay . People make mistakes . And he had this guilty look on his face , you know ? This little guilty- - and I said , Peanut , what--what 's the matter ? What 's wrong , you know ? And he leaned into my ear and whispered , " Mommy , I ate God too " . Hey . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! That was close . Get the camera . And a flashlight . Do you have a flashlight ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Here , here , here . ( Rich ) What 's he doing ? ( Daughtery ) Laying eggs . Laying eggs . Step back from there . Sorry , Doctor . Sir , I--I wanted to give you an update on the specimen . Mmm-hmm ? I tracked it to Northern California . Who was with you ? ( Lee ) I took a few grunts from Northern Command . Sir , I talked to the HAZMAT teams . They had a tough time killing this specimen . Eventually had to use radiation . Do you mind if I ask , what is it ? The quicker question is , what isn 't it ? ( The Gardener ) Do you recognize this ? ( Lee ) It 's a griffon . Half eagle , half lion . A mythological hybrid . A chimera . An improvement . Dude , it 's time . Give it up . Nim ! Nim ! ( Miles ) Nimmy ! Seriously . Before you fry the box . Electricity and water don 't mix . Electricity and water . Th--that 's where he 'd go ! ( Phil ) Where ? ( Miles ) Come on ! Good God , Eli ! He took some doin ' , but I got him . Just throw the damn thing overboard . I plan to . Not before I make sure he ain 't comin ' back up . ( Miles ) He 'll come here , I know it . ( Phil ) How do you know it ? ( Miles ) 'Cause Nim always goes for the current . I 've seen him stick his tongue in a socket before . ( Phil ) No way . Critter Pop Rocks . Yeah , it 's like he gets drunk on electricity . Hey , dude , one time I stuck a straw in my nose and snorted root beer . I cried root beer . It was awesome . That 's great , Phil . [ sighs ] I know he 'll come . Look . Look . That 's him . It 's Nim . Wait a minute , man ! Faces of Death , my brother . He 's a tiger . I know . You just have to know how to talk to tigers . Nim . Nimmy , come here . It 's me . Nim ? Where 'd you go ? Nim ? You 're not Nim . You 're smaller . Miles ! Get outta there , man ! Dude , get out of there , man ! Watch out ! 585 00 : 37 : 46,421 - - 00 : 37 : 47,720 Miles ? Miles ! Just a sec . Hey , Miles ? Miles , man , if you borrow my CDs- - Oh , my God . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . What happened ? Don 't tell mom . I 'm fine . Nim did that . No , it wasn 't Nim . This one was smaller . There 's more than one ? They travel in packs , like a swarm . Is that what did this ? A swarm of these things ? Yeah . I think that 's what happened to the electrician . One was in the house . You gotta get rid of those speakers on the dock . Nim wouldn 't do anything like that . What about the wildlife guy ? Nim wouldn 't attack anyone unless they hurt him . Maybe someone did . ( Laura ) We 're almost out of air . Georgie . Georgie . [ giddily ] Georgie . [ weakly ] No , Rich . Don 't , Rich . Turn it off . Turn it off , turn it off , turn it off . ( Daughtery ) Turn it off , Rich . You better come take a look at this . ( Daughtery ) It 's like some sort of birthing zone . There 's hundreds of ' em . All laying eggs . This is what Cirko saw coming . The population explosion . Sorry , Nim . So that 's where all the chip clips went . You know the tiger that bit Roy ? Siegfried and Roy ? Yeah . Roy tripped or something , right ? Ye--yeah , but ... the tiger thought he 'd been hurt . So , he picked him up like a cub . He wasn 't trying to hurt him , he was protecting him . He crushed his trachea . You know the last words Roy said as they took him off ? No . " Don 't kill the cat . " Nim . You 've grown . We 're looking at the new top of the food chain . No , no , no ! Leave it , leave it ! Huh ? If he attacks us , maybe he can knock us free- - Oh , yeah ! Swallow us whole ! Yeah , well , Rich , we 're already dead ! ( Daughtery ) The light 's gonna draw them to us . Okay , here , just- - Here ! Bang ! It will set the life raft free ! I 'm not going to die down here . Come on ! Bang it ! Bang it hard ! Come on ! Come and get us ! Hit the ballast ! Hit the ballast ! You 're gonna free the life raft ! We 're going up . We 're going up . We 're going up , Rich . We 're on our way up , Rich . Okay , just hang in there . You okay , Rich ? Come on ! Stay with me ! We 're going up ! Oh , my God ! We 're at the surface . Oh , God . Okay , we made it . Just hang in there , Rich , okay ? Okay ? Just--oh , my God . We made it . Okay ! Okay ! Hang on , okay ? Yeah . Okay . I can 't open it ! You gotta turn it ! Y--you gotta turn it ! I am turning it ! I can 't open it ! Well , then just kick it ! Kick the damn thing ! Kick it ! Kick it ! Come on ! Kick it ! Oh , my God ! ( Rich ) Come on ! I got ya ! I got ya ! I got ya !

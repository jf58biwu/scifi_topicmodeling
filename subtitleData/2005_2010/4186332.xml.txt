 Let me tell you a funny story . Today is the 30th anniversary of my death . I died on a stream near the mine shaft . The mine was still operating then , So I was drowned in the rust-filled water . The mines started perishing when gold teeth grow in their mouth . Damn ... gold teeth . And rich bastards gathered around town for those " gold teeth . " It was more profitable to take out people 's teeth than to dig . At first they didn 't want to sell them , but what could they do ? Some made money selling teeth , then everybody wanted to sell . Nobody would work at the mine , and it closed . Once it closed , people without gold teeth lost their jobs . Shit , not having a gold tooth a sin was . Some even killed themselves with poison . Some families killed themselves altogether . My family had gold teeth , but I never sold any of them ! I never sell our body for money ! I don 't make money that easily . I make money only with blood and sweat ! My country is rich now because I worked so hard . Today you must remember me . You must be thankful . Is the world still in confusion ? I heard a casino is coming into town . It 's pretty quiet here . 30 years ago I knew so many people here . Now I 'm alone . But I 'll be remembered by ... My son , Jang Sangu . What can a miner 's son do for living ? He was a foreman in the mine . He had many men under him . My second son . This mess is all her fault . How could she abandon her husband ? She 's worse than a beast . You 're the only one who remember me . You are my son . Can we shop with that money ? It seems little . Don 't worry about money . We 'll earn it somewhere , right ? This damn town is always under construction . What can they build more in this small town ? Just a waste of money ... No dream ? No tomorrow ? Here is your paradise . Hey . Get me a rice soup along with a drink . You didn 't pay last time . No more free meal . I 'll pay when I get money . So come again with money . It 's not because he has no money . But because he should spend it for me ! Everybody is blind with money . It just changed so much . Long time ago this street was crowded . Now nobody wants to live here . Thousands of miners worked there . The rich took what they wanted and now deserted it . Damn , the rich destroyed this town . Everything has changed since they came here . There were many jobs here but not a job now . You 're still here . Your brother left for Seoul . But you 're still here to remember me , right ? Completely rotten . This man 's father made money selling teeth . My family has fallen because of his father . He 'd better die in hell . You can gargle now . Gargle your mouth ! Pulling out poor people 's teeth for money ? Like father , like son . Here , recharge this . After washing this tooth . You did a lot today . Here , 100 thousand won . Is this all ? It 's enough for rotten tooth . No refund , you know . Anything I can help today ? You should have come earlier . I already have a worker today . Rude bastard , just like his father . I really need money today . Bring it if you finish . It 's hard to break even because price of gold decreases . It 's getting worse everyday . Well done . Go rest up . I should buy some food for my father 's memorial table . Bastard . Don 't look down on my son . Today 's the delivery day . I 'm very busy today . I heard Mr. Ku owed you some money . True . Mr. Ku sold his 3 teeth this morning . You can get your money from him . Don 't tell him I told you so . Right , Ku borrowed a million won from you . Why didn 't I remember that ? He borrowed some money at gambling before . Hey , Ku . My money . What money ? Damn , a million won you borrowed from me ! I have no money now . You sold your gold teeth to the teeth dealer ? No , I didn 't . He said you sold 3 gold teeth . I did , but ... He just paid 500 thousand for them telling mines are old . He knows nothing but money . Such a greedy asshole ! Stop nonsense . Give me what you got . - Hold on . - Give it to me . I 'll make a million won with this and pay you back . How can you make a million won out of 500 thousand ? All these people want to make money too . What are they doing here ? The casino opens today . Look behind you ! More people are lined up . Here comes the bus . I 'll double the money in the casio , and pay you a million won . Everyone is crazy about the casino . They all want easy money . See you later when I 'm rich . Hey , Captain Hong . Aren 't you cold ? What the hell are you doing ? Are you going to the casino too ? Every idiot is fucking crazy for it . Fuck you , bitch . Are you still drinking and making a mess ? I see why your wife left you . Shut up , bitch ! You betrayed your labor union and still have self-respect ? Fuck you . You 're applying for abandoned mine manager ? I 'm going there to protest . I 'm gonna kill you if I see you there . Shit , I don 't do that stuff . Fucking bitch , protest until you die . Finished already ? Where 's my money ? I lost all . You just went in . The day goes by so quickly . The day went by ? What about my memorial day ? Bullshit ! What about my a million won ? Take it easy . Actually I got a job yesterday . Yesterday ? No jobs anymore in this town ! Tomorrow Company hired me as an abandoned mine manager . I 'll pay you back when I get my earnest money . Your Earnest money ? How much is it ? A million won ! The same amount , damn . Got a job ? He must be telling lies not to pay back . The draw for the job is made toady . 5 minutes left . Was it yesterday ? Then is yesterday today ? The winner is Mr. Ku Sedong ! - Congratulations . - Thank you . Everything 's all set up , shit . We 're always in open arms for you . Go home . Son , Ku got his earnest money . Get your a million won before he takes it and runs again . Give me my money . I haven 't got it yet . Come to the repair shop later and I 'll give it to you . Now I have to stop by somewhere . What 's wrong with him ? Crazy because of too much coal dust ? The repair shop was behind the 8th shaft ? Oh no . Isn 't ' this Mr. Ku ? Oh , this is not good . Now that the contractor is dead , who 's going to manage the abandoned mine ? Didn 't Ku owe some money to you ? Yes , he did . You want to receive that money ? Why don 't we go inside and talk ? That way ... Son , you must be careful . Men in suits don 't even work and take other 's money . He looks fine but he 's a swindler . He just talks and talks ... Let me to introduce myself . I 'm Kang , a secretary to Mr. Richard , the president of Tomorrow Co . Tomorrow Co ? Tomorrow Casino ? Bold investment ! Bold tomorrow ! Invest Tomorrow ! Tomorrow ... Ku 's earnest money . I was supposed to receive it today . Take it easy . It 's not our fault that he died . And It 's not our fault that he lost all at casino either . Listen . Managing the abandoned mine is very important business for our company . Mr. Ku was fit for the job until the tragedy . But he is dead now . Would you take his place ? Then you can sign here . Oh , this is Mr. Ku 's contract . We don 't need this anymore . We should draw lots again in an hour . We always follow the democratic process . So please don 't worry . You 're already hired for the job . Would you sign here ? Just write your name here . Read carefully before you sign . When you receive your earnest money , you shall get ku 's money as well . So come to the meeting room an hour later , I 'll give you the money . Bury Ku 's body . What ? Ku 's money ? You should take your earnest money and Ku 's money separately . Son , you can get 2 million won ! I got a job today . Today 's my father 's memorial day . Give me some money . I said it 's my father 's memorial day . You think I spend everyday begging ? I 'll pay you back with my salary . That bitch divorced and left my son . My son makes 2 million won a day . Thank him for going food shopping instead of you , bitch . Son , aren 't you going food shopping ? Hi . - Miss Kim , you busy ? - Yes . Bring me something good . No free drink any more . I have money . So get me something expensive . What a unusual occasion . Get him the cheapest one . Let me tell you a funny story . It was a week ago ... I went to the casino . I met a young couple there . What are you doing here ? We 're waiting for the casino 's opening . What ? The casino opens next week . No , it 's today . Look ! Really ? A week has passed ? Today must be last week . And in the afternoon , I was passing by the casino . Shit ! What 's wrong with that bitch ? You got your money from Ku ? - I 'll get it an hour later . - An hour later ? I haven 't seen him these days . Of course you 've not seen him 'cause he 's dead . Whenever they sell you their teeth , they die . They just commit suicide or ... - Do you lend money on gold ? - Yes , I do . I didn 't anything yet . Your only gold tooth has a deep root . I need a stronger tool . Don 't complain anymore . Use a more painful tool . Why are you so mean ? - Holy shit ! So many tools . - Something stronger ... What 's so frightening ? You brought it upon yourself . Enough . - We gambled together . - What are you talking about ? You 're upset ' cause I keep talking ? Pain serves you right . Sir , use strong pincers or something . You deserve horrible operation . Stop crying . It 's because you bet all in one game . You do everything at a time . Do dishes at a time , wash at a time ... I told you to divide it . At casino , I told you to divide the bets . Why don 't you eat at a time and breathe at a time ? Huh ? Hey , you almost killed him . - Does it hurt ? - Yes , it hurts to death . No , you can 't die alone . Pathetic . Gargle your mouth . Are you alright ? Oh , son , you are to sign the contract an hour later . What a job to prepare all by yourself . I wish your brother would be with you . Scraps of iron are everywhere . They were brand new when I worked here . All those people have disappeared and only useless things are left now . Who wants to use the useless garbage ? No one would remember anyway . So many people died on that tunnel . Some died of accidents . And some killed themselves . Some families committed suicide altogether . At that time , no gold teeth , no human . Today is the 30th anniversary of my death . I hope he comes back home today . It must be hard living in seoul . I 'm happy you start to work again on this special day . You can take this job because you 've worked hard . What a fair world it is ! Get lost , Tomorrow Co . That destroys our area ! Get lost ! Get lost ! Evil company ! Get lost , Tomorrow Co ! Get lost ! Get lost ! Fuck ! Fuck ! Fucking Tomorrow Co ! Fucking Tomorrow Co ! Fucking Tomorrow Co ! Now , comrades ! Let 's show them our unified power ! Fuck ! Fuck ! Fucking Tomorrow Co ! Let 's go kill them ! You fuck ! I told you not to come ! You communist bitch ! Don 't bother my son doing business . You son of a bitch ! Destroy Tomorrow Company ! Today 's winner is Mr. Jang Sangu ! Son , we made it ! Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! Congratulations ! Thank you . - Did you bury the body ? - Yes . And my earnest money ? My boss is coming tomorrow . You can get it tomorrow . I can get it tomorrow ? My boss is coming tomorrow . You can get it tomorrow . I knew this was going to happen ! Capitalist bastards will never change ! We need money today ! Today ! I really need money today . Today is ... Today is your father 's memorial day ? I know today is the day . Long time ago , your father ... Oh , he 's talking too much . Never mind . You really need money today ? Yes , we do ! There is a way ... If you receive money due to us , I 'll tell you . The first way is like this : Our Tomorrow hotel is actually taking a loss though it may seem fine . Some guests steal hotel supplies . We have many expensive things since it 's a high quality hotel . I think they 're upset for they lost money at casino . How evil they are ! They actually have a financial obligation to us . You can get money from them . But they ... I know you can 't find all of them you 've never met . Stop bullshit and give him the money ! There is the second way : You can get your money from a person you know . You know the teeth dealer , right ? He has some debt to our company , quite a lot . What ? He has a debt ? And he 's acting like rich man ! Let me tell you something interesting more . Do you know where he sells the gold teeth ? He sells them to our Tomorrow Company . I knew it ! Like father , like son ! Oh , but it doesn 't mean that he owed us himself . In fact , it 's the debt that his father accumulated . Don 't they look exactly alike ? As if an actor plays both characters ? Anyway , his father worked for our company too . Yes , he was a slave for them . He should go to hell for that ! He had lots of debts to us ... A debtor pretended to be rich ! He should fucking die ! But he suddenly died one day . Isn 't that strange ? What ? He got smacked in the back of his head too ? He deserved it ! Since he died in debt , his son is still responsible for the debt . We 're asking you to get the money from him on behalf of us . I don 't think you need a warrant . Who killed him ? Whom are you talking about ? Obviously those capitalists did because he wouldn 't pay back ! Son , be careful of this man . Let me explain more . It was 30 years ago ... This place is full of coal dust ! It 's so cold here ! Let 's not talk about it . You can just go get the money from him . You trust me , right ? You can go now . Right , you can 't get money from a dead man . You only have to prepare my table . If his debt is that old , he should pay interest too . You can add interest to your 2 million won . So you can get 4 million won ! You saw the teeth dealer ? He went up this way a minute ago . Where are you going ? I 'm going my way , asshole ! Where is she coming from ? Storage house only up there . She 's getting more suspicious . Things just ended up this way . Who did this ? That 's not important right now . You can 't get money from a dead man . I need to know who killed him so I can get the money . I do have someone in mind . Ku wanted to be our employee . And the dealer worked for us as well . So the murderer must be someone with hostility toward our company . Someone who tries to disrupt our business . Yes , one who hates the casino ! It 's captain Hong . We saw her coming down from here . Ku ! Teeth dealer ! She killed them both . So the killer is responsible for the debt . You can get money from the killer . She 's trying to ruin my memorial day . Get all the money from her . You bury him . With that shovel there . One second . Check his pockets . Give it to me . Check his mouth too . Nothing in it ? Then bury him now . As deep as possible . I 'm sure she did it . There 's a rumor that she injects virus into people . It must be very strong poison . It 's horrible . You can get all your money from her . 4 million isn 't enough . For she 's a murderer , you can add a million for penalty . So you can get 5 million won . Wait ! Where is it ? Son , come here . Dig again ! It 's gone ! Then ... Ku 's ? She 's a merciless killer . Yes , there must be some evidence . It 's our duty to find the evidence and reveal the killer . And get the money from her . Give me my 5 million , bitch ! There must be evidence that she killed them . Look ! No head here too ! She cut off heads of those who go to casino . This is it ! The evidence we 're looking for . Kill the communist ! - You bitch ! - What 's wrong with you ? You monster bitch ! Son , beat her ! Shit ! Anyway , you 're dead today . You can 't cut off my son 's head . Today he should remember me ! You always talk about class and revolution . And you killed people for money ? Do you know how tragic it is to die for money ? Do you remember ? You brothers used to play on this street . I like this place too . I wrongly died ... But you 'll remember me today . Untie , asshole . You killed the dealer and Ku ? Why would I kill them ? You can 't deny the evidence ! Ku took out your gold tooth before he died ! This tooth was in Ku 's hand . Isn 't it yours ? Let 's see ! You dumb shit ! I never had any gold tooth ! Don 't lie to me , bitch . I 'm my own gold tooth , shit . Hello . Hi . I 'm your mom 's friend . She needs some money right now . So she wants you to bring all the money you have . To where ? Here are many coins ! She lied after all . I 'm sure she 's hiding 5 million won somewhere . Let 's go food shopping with the money before shops close . Go to the market this time . How much is dried fish ? This is a thousand and that is 4 thousand won . Get the good one . I 'll take the cheaper one . Well , I don 't need expensive one . It 's for my father 's memorial . This is more expensive than that . You may need the expensive one on memorial table . Get the expensive one ! I 'll take the cheaper one . What 's wrong with you ? This is the cheaper one ? It 's for my memorial table ! Buy the expensive one ! I 'll take this one . You ungrateful son ! I want my table rich . You 'll get 5 million won anyway . So Prepare the table well ! My memorial day is today , not tomorrow ! Shit , I barely left some money . I don 't need good food for the dead man . This is enough for him . It 's a pain in the ass every year . I 'm fucking tired of it . Preparing for the memorial table all by myself , shit . Where is she hiding the money anyway ? Shit , I need to drink first . You 're drinking too much today . Let me tell you a funny story . A year ago , there was draw for abandoned mine manager . I was a winner . It was real hot competition . The earnest money was a million won ! Can you imagine how big money it is ? We can get 5 million won , my son ! How can a million become 5 million ? A million is a million . You brag too much . They told me to come tomorrow to get the money , fuck . I bought a bottle of liquor for my father 's memorial . But I was so upset I drank it all . What 's the good of memorial day when I have no money ? Then I was on my way home . I came across my wife talking with captain Hong . You know they 're close friends . And it was before I got a divorce ... I was overhearing their talk . Those bitches were talking about my brother who died 30 years ago . My brother wasn 't the only one who fucking committed suicide ! No . It wasn 't what we talked about . Your brother killed himself ? Isn 't he in Seoul ? He killed himself with poison . Why ? Maybe he didn 't want to prepare father 's memorial . Then what were they talking about ? Captain Hong left something in the mine , but she couldn 't remember ... That was what we 're talking . Damn , I knew it ! She 's hiding money somewhere . Where is it ? - How much is it ? - 10 thousand won . I have only 9 thousand ... Hi . Aspirin , please . Thanks . - They 're short of some money ? - Yes , a thousand . Wait ! - Thank you for your kindness . - It 's no problem . - We want to make up for it . - It 's okay . - What do we have ? - Pillow in my bag . We brought this from the casino hotel . - It 's really expensive and large . - No thanks . Take it as token of gratitude . You stole hotel property ! You thieves , I got you ! Give me my money ! - Give me my money ! - He must be crazy ! Get them ! What a unlucky day . No mercy on the thieves . They 're running away with my money ! Somebody get them for me ! - I 'm scared . - Nobody here . Are you ready ? - Give it to me . - I 'll drink and die first . - Don 't be silly . - Give me . I think someone 's here . There 's no one here . It 's scary here . Let 's drink and die . Hey ! Where are you going ? You received your money ? Not yet . You saw the couple ? - Oh , the young couple ? - Yes . - I saw them . - Which way did they go ? There 's no need to find them . They 're already dead . - What ? - They died 10 years ago . They owed my company so much before they died . They 're very irresponsible suckers . How much do they owe you ? 5 million won ! My dad told me it 's 5 million ! Including the money before , 10 million won can be paid to you . Your father would be very happy with 10 million . You want to get it ? Follow me . Right . I should get at least 10 million won 'cause casino hotel properties are very expensive . They died 10 years ago ? 10 year is no problem if I can get the money . Shit , not easy to get it . Where did they hide it ? Would you share me some ? It tastes good . Let 's go . They 're here . You can get 10 million from them . She killed people again ! Now it 's very clear who owe you the money at last . Be careful of my food ! You did it ! You killed them ! Give me my money . Tell me where it is . You 're getting on my nerves today ! You have a grudge against me ? What a unlucky day ! You 're pissing me off . So are you happy with all the money ? Where did you hide it ? My 10 million won , you bitch ! That 's not true . They killed themselves . They drank poison . He didn 't die with poison . No , you haven 't finished killing yet . You kill again with a shovel . You can 't dig with poison . Where are you going ? To 30 years ago ! Dad , where 's she going ? She 's going to find a shovel to cut off heads . Right , she must hide money where her shovel is . Son , follow her and get the money to prepare more for my table ! Shit , isn 't it enough for the table ? I bought dried fishes and ... You think I 'm happy with the cheap dried fish ? You ungrateful . Today 's the 30th anniversary of my death ! I 'm sick of hearing your 30 years . Bitch ! You think it 's unfair ? It 's not only you who died 30 years ago . You little bitch . Shut your mouth ! Let me tell you a funny story . It was 30 years ago ... 30 years ago , gold teeth began to grow in people 's mouths . But I had no gold tooth . The rich thought it was strange . So they took me somewhere ... I was scared and I escaped . But he couldn 't . Since then , nobody has seen him . Some said he killed himself , Some said he left for seoul . Anyhow , I kept looking for him . I believed he was around here . Son , what are you looking for ? I 'm here . Let 's go home . No , dad . I think I can find him . Son , There 's no one here . Give me a second . I 'm almost there . Are you looking for money ? We have enough food . Let 's go home and eat . No , I 'm almost there . You 're not looking for money , bitch ! I think I remember now . You monster bitch ! Don 't remember anything . Stop and get out right now ! You bitch ! You know nothing ! You are nothing cause you have no father ! He must be around here . Today sons will remember their father . Right , she finally got her shovel . Now I remember ! Neither he killed himself nor left for seoul . I find out what happened when I get there . I can find him when I get there ! Yes , she 's hiding money here . Fuck money ! Sister ! Where 's the money ? Son , she won 't tell anything . Let 's kill her now ! Where did you hide it , bitch ! I 'll make you talk . Good ! Right , hit her ! Wait ! She 's saying something . Don 't let her speak . Just kill her ! Let me just say this before I die . You want to know who killed Ku and the dealer ? Do you know what happened 30 years ago ? Kill her now ! Nothing happened 30years ago ! Shut up , old man ! Shut her mouth now ... You know your father had heavy debt , right ? But you don 't know he owed all to Tomorrow Co . Your father worked for Tomorrow Co . , even before it built the casino . But he happened to fall into debt . Maybe he gambled . So he went to the teeth dealer . 'Cause he had no other choice . You know the teeth dealer , don 't you ? Father and son are exactly alike . Hey , I need some money . You sold your gold teeth already . No , not mine ... This isn 't true ! Don 't listen to her ! It 's strange . He has no gold tooth . I need to take him to the lab . The lab ? Can I get money ? Well , I guess so . And your brother was sent to the lab . Father sold his own son . Then your brother returned to the town , but couldn 't remember anything . He couldn 't remember anyone , even his father . Where is he ? Son , she 's a liar . How could she know all this ? I was there too . I was with your son in the lab . Remember the lab where gold toothless kids were sent ? Son of a bitch , he 's come back insane . - Give me my money ! - They didn 't pay me yet ! And that day , the dealer was killed . Your brother got worse day by day and then your father died too . Who do you think killed them ? It 's just the beginning . Since then , people began to be killed with their heads cut off . Who do you think did it ? Who cut off their heads ? She is a fucking storyteller . She 's lying . She is the murderer . Secretary Kang said too , that she killed Ku and the dealer . She 's the murderer ! Kill her now ! Wait . No money if I kill her . She knows where it is . She must be punished first . Kill her ! Then whom can I get 10 million from ? It 's a big money . What 10 million ? Only earnest money is yours . Don 't you still know who killed you ? It must be you who killed me , you bitch . You hit my head with shovel ! Your brother wasn 't dead . Don 't you see who killed your father and took their heads ? Son ! What are you doing ? What about your father 's memorial ? Get out . You 're not my family anymore . You 're drunk again today . Your father must be proud you drank all day . You 've not changed at all . Like father , like son . You think it 's easy to dig for living ? You hit me ? I 'm not your wife anymore ! You cannot beat me anymore ! Tomorrow Wasn 't I to manage the abandoned mine ? You 're fired . If you want to apply again , stand in the line . What do you mean ? What about my earnest money ? You 're fired . Please stand in the line . Give me my money ! Isn 't your boss coming here today ? He is in Seoul . What about my money ? He is in Seoul . You thought I was dead ? You thought I was dead ? Excuse me . I came to get my stuff . Don 't mind me . And bold investment ! Bold tomorrow ! Invest your tomorrow ... Get the fuck out of here . Get out of my sight . Wake up , you sucker . I 'm really sick of you . How can I get to Seoul ? What ? You can take a train ! Do I need money to take a train ? You have no money ? Here , get lost ! One ticket for Seoul . Son ! Must be crazy ! No ? Is President Richard here ? He is in Venezuela . I heard he 's in Seoul . He is in Venezuela . How can I get to Venezuela ? How can I get to Venezuela ? How can I get to Venezuela ? I don 't ' know . How can I get to Venezuela ? How can I get to Venezuela ? Venezuela . How can I get to Venezuela ? I don 't know . How can I get to Venezuela ? How can I get to Venezuela ? How can I get to Venezuela ?

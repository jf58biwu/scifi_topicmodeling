 Keep it straight ! Come on , straight . Give him room ! Hold the line , gentlemen ! Look left ! Look right ! Hold the line ! It 's here . It 's here . Hey , calm down , Buddy . Hey . Let him go . Let him go . Let him go . Let him go . Let him go . Easy , easy . Let him go ! Let him go , let him go . Here . Here , it 's here . - It 's here ! - Back up . Give him some room . I 've gone over the charts you 've sent and consulted another pediatric neurologist who works with me here . - We 're alarmed by two things . - Deficiency in lipid metabolism and diminished enzyme output . - Right . That 's exactly right . Both indicate lysosomal storage illness . You 're the boy 's primary physician , Dr ? Scully . Dana Scully . You tested his lysosome function ? I think you have all my results there , doctor . My fear is that it 's a type-two , degenerative brain disease like Sandhoff disease that his enzymes aren 't clearing lipids from his brain , causing atrophy . If you suspect Sandhoff disease , I 'd test the boy 's levels of hexosaminidase . I 've done that . What I 'm looking for here , doctor is a course of treatment . There is no treatment for Sandhoff . But if there were , I 'm sure you 'd tell me . Hi , Christian . How are you feeling ? Okay , Dr. Scully . How are you ? Me ? Well , I 'm doing just fine , thank you . You got some outside opinions ? Yes . We 're gonna do some more tests . Dana Scully ? Dr. Scully , I 'm looking for Fox Mulder . Excuse me . - Special Agent Drummy with ... - I can guess who you 're with . The FBI urgently needs to speak with Fox Mulder . I don 't work with Fox Mulder any longer . I don 't work with the FBI . Well , if you could contact him it might just save the life of an FBI agent . What 's up , doc ? You 've become awfully trusting , Mulder for a man wanted by the FBI . Eyes in the back of my head , Scully . " Auf einer Wellenlänge , " as the Germans say . It 's a precognitive state often confused with intuition in which the brain perceives deep logic underlying transitory human existence unaided by the conscious mind materializing much as you did just now . Though if you 'd actually materialized , you 'd be rapidly dematerializing . But who believes that crap anymore ? Well , they do at the FBI , apparently . I had a visitor today , Mulder . The FBI wants your help finding a missing agent . I hope you told them to screw themselves . They say all is forgiven . That they 'll drop all charges against you if you come in and help them solve this . The FBI will forgive me ? They put me on trial on bogus charges and tried to discredit a decade of work . They should be asking for my forgiveness . I think they are . Desperately . How can I possibly help these people ? Someone 's come forward with some promising evidence . A psychic , he claims . It 's a trick , Scully , to smoke me out . If the FBI wanted to get you , I have no doubt that they could . I think they 've been happy to have you out of their hair . Good . I am just as happy having them out of mine . A young agent 's life is at stake . Mulder , I know I don 't have to say this , but it could have been you once . Or me . You know , the truth is , I worry about you and the effects of long-term isolation . I 'm fine here . I 'm happy as a clam . I 'll tell them your answer . Shit . Okay , I 'll go . Under one condition . Thanks for the lift . Don 't thank me . I didn 't send it . Wait here . Come in . Excuse me . They 're here . Thanks for making this happen . I 'm Special Agent in Charge Whitney . - Dana Scully . - Fox Mulder , I believe ? I know this is awkward . Welcome back . My team and I appreciate your trust . Well , trust being what it is , what if I can 't help you ? Or your agent turns up dead ? The past is the past . I know your work on X-Files cases and believe you may be the best chance Monica Bannan has now . - How long has she been missing ? - Since Sunday evening . Almost three days . I know you know this , but after 72 hours there 's slim chance she 's still alive . - We have slim reason to believe she is . So far , we 've got no evidence to the contrary and the facts give us hope . Soon after she goes missing , we find this : a severed arm . - Where ? - About 10 miles from her home . I don 't understand . It 's a man 's arm . Is it a match for evidence found at or near the crime scene ? Blood or tissue ? Blood . Found in her garage and on the tool that matches the wound . - You were led to it ? - Like a needle in a haystack . By someone claiming psychic powers . Joseph Fitzpatrick Crissman . - And you think he 's full of shit . - What makes you say that ? Psychic . - Father Joe was ... - Father ? - He was a priest ? - Catholic . He cold-called six hours after Monica Bannan was reported missing claiming a vision of her . A psychic connection . - And he tells you she 's alive ? - That 's right . Have you found any other connection ? - To Monica Bannan ? - No . That 's why I sent for you . - I need to know we 're not wasting time . - Well he 's a religious man , clearly . Educated man . He took right action , said nothing to cast doubt upon himself has no connection to the crime . You 're wasting time only it 's mine and your agents ' . There 's a question of credibility . If no reason to doubt the man , why doubt the man 's visions ? He didn 't lead us to Monica Bannan . He gave us a guy 's bloody arm in the snow . This is not an exact science . If it were me , I would be on the guy 24 / 7 . I 'd be in bed with him , kissing his holy ass . Father Joe 's a convicted pedophile . Maybe I 'd stay out of bed with him . What is this ? - Dorms for habitual sex offenders . - Dorms ? They manage the complex and police themselves . Father Joe lives here voluntarily with his roommate . Just avoid the activities room . Joe ? Tell them to come in . Father Joe ? Excuse the mess . I haven 't been sleeping . Father Joe , this is Fox Mulder . - Okay . - He 'd like to ask some questions . Actually , I 'd like to ask something . What was it you were praying for in there , sir ? - For the salvation of my immortal soul . - Do you think God hears your prayers ? - Do you think he hears yours ? - I didn 't bugger 37 altar boys . - That 's a colorful way of putting it . - I have another word . I 'm sure you do . I have to believe he does hear me , or why would he send these visions ? Maybe it 's not God doing the sending . You call them visions . You see them ? In what you might call my mind 's eye . What do you see ? I see the poor girl being assaulted . I see her putting up a fight . - I hear dogs barking . - Where ? Can 't tell . - But you see her alive . - No , but I ... I feel that she is . Can you show us how you do it ? I don 't know that I can do this right now . Maybe it 'd be better if she wasn 't here . Maybe what you see is a way to try and make people forget what it is that you really are . Jesus , Mulder . So much for kissing his holy ass . I 'm sorry . I 've been too long away from this business . Or not long enough . No , you were good in there . All I had were questions . But you pushed him , you challenged him . Like old times . Yeah , well , he 's a creep . And a liar . He knows who did this . They 're supplying him with information . Look where he lives . And this arm they found ? This wasn 't severed in any fight . It was cut cleanly , chopped off . And tell me how he 's been able to lead them straight to it and not even muster a guess as to where the victim is . Two things you 're gonna find in the next 24 hours : A dead agent , and that this guy , Father Joe , is a big , fat fraud . You could be right , Scully . You could be right . But what if you 're wrong ? - What are you doing ? - Gonna take him for a ride . See just how psychic this Father Joe really is . Yeah , well , it 's been fun . Scully ? Nobody 's gonna make you sit next to him . Thanks , but I 've already been taken for a ride . Anyway , he doesn 't want me there . - I want you here . - This isn 't my life anymore , Mulder . I 'm done chasing monsters in the dark . I think you 've done all they 've asked of you here too . You know , no one says you have to stay here . These people need my help . And I could really use yours . - Are we getting warm ? - You tell us . I don 't know I have a clue of where we are . That 's all right . Everybody works differently . Who are you , the good cop ? I 'm the non-cop . I don 't know this girl . This Agent Bannan of yours . I haven 't a clue of the connection . There 's always something , however small . And who made you the expert ? I once investigated a series of cases involving unexplained phenomena for the FBI . So you believe in these sort of things ? Let 's just say I wanna believe . And his sister was abducted by E.T. Is that true ? It was a long time ago . She 's dead isn 't she ? Your sister . This is where she was taken . Your agent . This is where she was attacked . I want him to see the crime scene . No , it 's ... This isn 't right . You 've brought me to the wrong house . Pulled that right out of his ass . There were news crews covering the scene . Pictures of the neighborhood . He could 've recognized it from TV . Yeah , but ... ? But why ? - Why ? - Why do it ? Why go to great lengths to create an elaborate fiction ? Expiation . Forgiveness of his sins . He 's written dozens of letters to the Vatican , pleading reengagement . Rather odd way to impress the Holy See . Voice of God speaking through a man ? That 's been a winner a few times . - So you think he 's guilty too , huh ? - We have to consider him a suspect . You 've found no connection to the crime . Don 't think my guys stopped . They think they 're gonna find one . Yeah , but you don 't or I wouldn 't be here . I 'm not the most popular girl at the FBI right now for calling you in . Believe me . I wasn 't exactly Miss Popularity at the FBI myself . But you 've dealt with psychics before . Luther Lee Boggs , Clyde Bruckman , Gerald Schnauz . I went through those cases , and that work was extremely impressive . Yeah , well , I 'm only half the team . But it 's your insights I need . She ran away . She tried to escape . There were two men . Well , she couldn 't . He pushed her down . It was here . It was right here . And then they put her in the back . - Where ? - In the car . No . - It was a truck with something on it . - We have to find her ! She 's in pain . Great , great pain . - Tell me where . - I don 't know . I can 't see . - We need to find her . - I can 't see . I can 't see . Because he 's pulling it out of his ass . Father Joe ? Hi , Christian . You 're looking very bright-eyed this morning . - I was thinking . - Yeah ? What were you thinking ? How I 'm going to get out of here . Well , you know , I 'm thinking exactly the same thing . Can I get out of here soon ? What 's wrong ? Has something scared you ? The way the man is looking at me . What man ? Don 't be afraid . I was just looking for those . I wanted to go over them myself and the results of the new tests that you ordered . That isn 't really your purview , Father . It 's his primary physician 's . It is in my purview to make sure all my physicians are making the right choices for their patients and for the hospital . Can I have the test results , please ? We are here to heal the sick , not prolong the ordeal of the dying . There are other , better facilities for the boy . Hey , hey . Hey ! I 'm okay . I 'm fine . I can feel you thinking . I 'm sorry . I can 't sleep . Actually , I have a little something for that . - Just a little something ? - Thank you . What 's the matter ? I have a patient , a young boy with a rare brain disease . He 's very , very sick . Why haven 't you told me about this before ? I thought there was something I could do . There 's not ? Well , there 's radical treatments , but nobody wants to talk about those . Even the experts say there 's nothing to be done . Nothing but ... Nothing but let him die . So I 'm lying here , cursing God for all his cruelties . Do you think God is losing any sleep ? Why bring a kid into the world just to make him suffer ? I don 't know , Mulder . I 've got such a connection to this boy . How old is he ? You think it 's because of William . I ... I think our son left us both with an emptiness that can 't be filled . Just go to sleep . Let me curse God for a while . Thank you . Scratchy beard . There was something weird on the toxicology report of the severed arm . What ? I looked over the FBI evidence reports again . In the tissue , there were traces of a drug and traces of a drug called acepromazine . Why is that weird ? Acepromazine 's an animal tranquilizer . Now I can 't sleep . Mulder ? What is animal tranquilizer doing in the tissue sample of a man 's severed arm ? I can 't even begin to speculate . He said he heard barking dogs . - Who ? - Father Joe . Mulder , what are you doing ? Is it a tranquilizer that you might give a dog ? He 's a phony , Mulder . He pulls these so-called visions out of thin air . He 's got you straining to connect them . When I see a man cry tears of blood at a crime scene he recognizes without ever having visited , I need to go out on a limb . Tears of blood ? Yeah , some trick , huh ? How do you fake that ? - Hello ? - Hello , Dr. Scully ? - Yes . - I have Dakota Whitney for you . Can you hold on a second ? Sorry to call at this hour . - Has there been a break ? - They find her ? - We 're pursuing another lead . - The same source ? Same source , new news . It 's here . It 's here . Turn up ahead , at the barn . One more time . Ten minutes . - Did you find her ? - No . - What did you do ? - What ? You said there was news . The news is our psychic led us to the exact same site he led us to before . You 're gonna find it . That 's what you keep saying . You 're gonna find a body . - You keep telling us she 's alive . - She is . We could do this all night . These guys are all running on empty . I 'm sorry for bringing you out here . Hey , let 's go , fellas ! Bring it in ! Let 's go ! Bring it in , gentlemen . Time to go home . Tell me . Tell me what you see . I see a face . I see eyes staring out . Who ? Who is it ? It 's unclear . Like through dirty glass . It 's out there . I know it . What does he mean , " Like through dirty glass " ? - Mulder . - What ? Stop . Okay , feel free to give up like everybody else . This is not my job anymore , Mulder . No , that 's right . That 's right . You 're just like my booking agent now , right ? You 're right . - This is my fault . - What do you mean , it 's your fault ? For getting you involved in this . No . No . It was the right thing to do , Scully . This is not about finding an FBI agent . This is about you trying to save your sister . My sister is dead . It hasn 't stopped you from looking for her . Mulder , I have been through this too many years with you believing you can save her . You cannot save her . Not now , and not ever . I need those men back . - What are you doing ? - I 'm trying to ignore you . This is it . Here it is . This is it . We need shovels . It 's solid ice . No . It 's dirty glass . Flashlight ? You 're gonna need resources . We need equipment . Concrete saws and a backhoe . You two , get on the line . You two , come with me . Don 't give up . Please ! Get me out of here ! Help ! Help ! Get me out of here ! Please , please . Please , I won 't tell . I won 't tell anyone . I won 't tell anyone . Just let me go . I just want to go home . I 'm sorry I hit your truck . I didn 't mean to do it . I didn 't mean to hit your truck . I didn 't mean it . Wait . Stop . Wait . Wait . What is this place ? Who are you ? Please , just get me out of here . Get up . I can help you . Just get me out of here . Help ! I think we can resolve , then , in good conscience and without objection to relocate the patient to a facility suited for and humane to his condition . As you and I discussed , Dr. Scully , I was informing the staff and doctors of the hospital 's decision on Christian Fearon . I 'm sorry , what decision ? To relocate the patient to a hospice who will manage his palliative care . That was a discussion , not a decision . Well , it 's been discussed here at length , with no objection from your colleagues . I have an objection . You have , Dr. Scully , a patient with an untreatable condition . Now , that 's very sad and unfortunate . Nobody disagrees with that . - But he 's my patient . - Unless you 've come here with a cure for Sandhoff disease we all ask that you let the boy go in peace . Thank you . Now , I 'd like to wrap up so we can get on to the day 's good work . We have the final matter of a patient in intensive care Dr. Willard 's patient , I believe . Admitted after suffering myocardial infarction during ... - There is a treatment . - The matter is resolved , Dr. Scully . No , it 's not . The disease can be treated with intrathecal stem-cell therapy . You 're not serious . Don 't put the boy through hell . - Would you do it if it was your son ? - It 's not her son and he 's not yours . And it 's not a decision for hospital administration . It 's his doctor 's . If you 'd like to challenge that you can take the matter up with a higher authority . I have taken it up with the highest authority , Dr. Scully . As should you . Come on , pick up . Come on . Come on . Answer . This is Dana Scully , please leave a message . Scully , it 's me . I keep leaving you messages . Here 's what I want to tell you . That woman 's head in the ice ? It 's not the agent 's . It 's not Bannan 's . We don 't know who she is , but so far we 've pulled 11 discrete human limbs from the ice and we 're not done yet . Each one a clean cut too . An exact match to the previous amputation you noted , Scully . It looks like someone 's been dumping body parts in the ice there for months possibly years . And there seems to be no pattern to the limbs . Men and women , all with healthy , undiseased tissue according to forensics , which suggests to me that they are victims . But here 's the thing , what I need you to know . We found more traces of your animal tranquilizer , acepromazine . I don 't know what the hell it means , but I 'm hoping you can make sense of it . - Anything ? - No , I can 't reach her . But this is gonna make sense . This is a break . I 'm feeling it . You 're feeling it . Father Joe 's feeling it . I 'm feeling my head spinning . This is a serial case . You 're gonna solve a dozen murders here . Yes , but I 'm no closer to finding my agent . No , we 're gonna find her . I know it . Well , she may have to stand in line . I see a woman 's face . Another woman taken from a car . She 's being held in a box , I think . Is she with Monica Bannan ? I don 't know . Is it the same men that took her ? I think so . Yes . It 's the same men . You see this , or are you just telling these people what they wanna hear ? - No . - No , you don 't see it . No , it 's ... It 's the same men . - I want a car ready . - To go where ? I don 't know yet . I don 't believe this . That 's been your problem from the start . - I can get you a car . - And a list of missing persons over the last 48 to 72 hours . - Hi . - Hi . Cheryl Cunningham , 34 , never made it to work last night . No-show at home either . There 's no blood on the airbags . Driver 's side window knocked out . Keys in the ignition . Survivable crash with a seatbelt . She sets off , takes a shortcut gets tired , sits down , falls asleep . Happens all the time . Hard left turn for such a long , straight stretch of country road , don 't you think ? But why settle for my opinion ? I 'm sorry . I 'm not getting anything . What a surprise . What a surprise . - I think we 're done with Father Joe . - Yeah . - We 're not quite finished . - What is that ? Medical ID bracelet . I noticed your missing agent wore one too . - For what ? - What are you thinking ? Let 's pop the trunk . - This isn 't gonna do her much good . - It 's a gym bag . It 's a bathing suit . It 's frozen stiff . - Chlorine . - Where 's the nearest public pool ? Hi . We 're hoping you can help us . Would you like lockers ? We 're with the FBI . We 'd like to show you a photo , if you don 't mind . Why would I mind ? - Do you know this person ? - Let me see . These young people look so much the same . - Do you have a sign-in register ? - Yes , I keep one every day . - I 'd like to see yesterday 's . - I threw yesterday 's away . Excuse me , sir . Doesn 't he know that 's the women 's side ? Hi , Christian . You 've got a whole bunch of people taking good care of you today , okay ? What ? Now you look scared . People say I went underground . I 'm sorry , Mulder . - I have to keep my focus here . - It 's the boy , isn 't it ? Yeah . I thought there was nothing to be done . I 'm taking a big chance on something . On a radical and extremely painful new procedure . Last night you said that wasn 't an option . It wasn 't last night . What changed your mind ? When will you know if it 's working ? There 's a series of these procedures and we won 't know until they 're all done . But that 's not what you came to talk about . There 's another woman missing . She 's given us something to go on . She and the missing agent swam at the same pool . The agent kept a locker there . We think they were stalked . Both wore medical ID bracelets and both had the same rare blood type : A-B negative . Organs harvested for transplant . That 's how they were targeted . Donors and recipients need matched types . Someone using that pool knows that . Black market . Somebody filling orders . Well , they have access . Recipients , hospitals . That 's your world . Your knowledge will save time . Time is our enemy . Start with the transporters . Call the Richmond DA . No , no , no , I need you on this with me . No . No , Mulder . You asked for me to get involved , Scully . Now I 'm asking for you to stay involved . Mulder . You helped them already . You broke the case for them . - Why don 't you let the FBI pursue it ? - We 're so close now . - I 'm asking you to let it go . - It 's not that simple . No . It 's complicated . What is that supposed to mean ? Something I knew would happen , that I 've been afraid of that I haven 't had to face until now . What ? Just say it . I 'm a doctor , Mulder . - That 's not my life anymore . - I know that . You 're not understanding me . I can 't look into the darkness with you anymore , Mulder . I cannot stand what it does to you or to me . I 'm fine with it , Scully . I 'm actually okay . I 'm good . Yeah , that 's what scares me . Where else would you have me look if you want me to find these women alive ? I 'm asking you to look at yourself . Why ? I ... I don 't think I 'm the one who 's changed . We 're not FBI anymore , Mulder . We are two people who come home at night . To a home now . I don 't want that darkness in my home . Scully , this is who I am . It 's who I 've always been . This is who I was before I met you . - It 's what I do . It 's everything I know . - Write it down . Put it in a book . Are you asking me to give up ? No . I can 't tell you to do that , Mulder . But I can tell you that I won 't be coming home . Scully . Mulder , I 've got my own battles to fight . - Don 't do this . - Please don 't argue with me . Don 't do this now . I don 't know what else to do . Well ... Good luck , then . You too . Dr. Scully ? We 'd like to speak with you , if we may , about Christian . - Have you been in to see him ? - Yes . He was sleeping . - But we 've ... - We 've changed our minds about going forward with this new treatment . But you don 't even know if it 's working yet . We think that Christian 's been through enough . We want to put our faith in God now . - I see . - It 's nothing against you . No . If you were a mother , you 'd understand . Have you spoken to Father Ybarra ? Yes . But the decision is ours . What if it did work ? What if we found we 'd made the wrong choice by stopping ? You 're saying you can save my son ? I 'm saying I don 't want to give up now . We 're about to hit the tarmac when all of a sudden , the plane gears up and we 're back up in the air . I say , " Honey , isn 't this fantastic ? We 're going to die together . " Turns out there was a plane parked on the tarmac and we missed colliding with it by seconds . But we were in love and it was romantic . Sir ? Excuse me , sir ? Can we talk with you a minute ? I 'm transporting vital organ . - That 's what we 'd like to talk about . - This is my job . I move quickly . I don 't have much time . Please , sir . Step over here . My name is Robert Koell , with the District Attorney 's office in Richmond . - May I see your license ? - I have green card . - What are you transporting ? - Human liver for transplant . Paperwork and license , please . Where are you delivering it ? Willow 's Memorial Hospital . They 're expecting it . A patient wait for it . Have you procured or delivered an organ outside of normal or lawful channels ? No . You 're an employee . How would your employer answer this question ? He 's sick . Has cancer . That 's not what I asked you . Am I under some kind of suspicion ? A vision , if ever I had one . May I speak with you ? Would you like to come in ? Make yourself comfortable . I won 't be staying long . Have you come here by yourself ? Yes . Sit . Please , I insist . Now , you came to ask something . We 're alone , free to speak in confidence . You said something to me the other night in the snow . - Yes . I said , " Don 't give up . " - I need to know why you said that . I haven 't the faintest idea . - Were you hoping for another answer ? - Do you know anything about me ? Other than that you loathe me ? - Do you know what it is that I do ? - No . I can see you 're a woman of faith . But not in the same things as your husband . - He 's not my husband . - Do you care to tell me about yourself ? - No . - Do you care to offer a confession ? - I don 't think you 're ... - What ? In a position to judge ? Yet you 've judged me , haven 't you ? - You deserve to be judged . - Do you know why we live here ? The men who call this vile box of monsters home ? Because we hate each other , even as we hate ourselves for our sickening appetites . - That doesn 't make it less sickening . And where do they come from ? These appetites , these uncontrollable urges of ours ? - Not from God . - Not from me . I castrated myself when I was 26 . And the visions weren 't my idea either . - Proverbs 25 : 2 . - What ? God 's glory to conceal a thing but the honor of kings to search out a matter . - Don 't quote scripture to me . - What are you doing here ? - What are you afraid of ? - " Don 't give up . " What was that for ? - I don 't know . - I don 't believe you . - I 'm telling you the truth . - They were your words . - I don 't know why . - You said them to my face ! All I ever wanted was to serve him . All I 've ever wanted was to serve God . You can ask for his pity , but don 't expect mine . You can stop the act any time . Look at me . Paramedics have been here now . They 've been here for seven minutes . He 's stabilized . Blood pressure 's normal . No , they 're loading him in now . - What happened ? - Thank you . He had a seizure . - Who called you ? - No one . So , what are you doing here ? We need to talk to Father Joe . - Well , that 's not gonna happen . - We 've got a suspect . A Russian émigré working as an organ transporter . - In custody ? - No . The DA questioned him about trafficking black-market organs but he was released . They had no evidence to hold him . We 've got a witness who says he swam at the women 's pool . ASAC Whitney ? - Excuse me . - What 's that got to do with Father Joe ? - It 's the man in his visions , Scully . - Who ? - The suspect . The man in this photo . - Now you 're wasting their time . Tell me again what you 're doing here . Here 's a vision for you . A couple of my guys just had it . Who 's this ? Our suspect 's employer . An old friend of Father Joe 's , we just learned . - Known him for over 20 years . - Known him how ? That 's one of his 37 altar boys . Three guesses who he 's married to in the state of Massachusetts . Our suspect . We got a warrant to search their offices . Mulder . It 's over . - Hey , hey ! Hey ! - What ? Mulder . Why don 't you hold up ? Let these men do their jobs . Clear this bottom floor . We were fooled . I wanted to believe as bad as anyone . Look , I don 't need sweet talk . - You led us here . - Father Joe led us here . This is Special Agent Drummy with the FBI . We have warrants to search these offices . Anyone inside , identify yourself and unlock the door now . I called you in because I thought you could help me . - I valued your belief in these phenomena . - Now what do you think ? I think this is a longer conversation . Down on the floor ! Down on the floor ! Anybody here , I want down on the floor ! Somebody find the lights . We were at a standstill . You pushed forward , no matter the direction we took . Hey ! Hey ! What are you , nuts ? Hey ! Stop him ! Hey , you can 't go ... Hey . Come on . - Quick , which way did they go ? - Down that way . - Mulder ! - I 'm up here ! Mulder ! He 's coming at you . Hey ! Mulder ! - Yeah . - Where are you ? - Right here . - Where ? Fox . - Where is he ? Do you have him ? - No . I lost him . - I saw him . - Where ? They 're both dead . Monica Bannan and Dakota Whitney . I heard . I 'm sorry . Yeah , well ... - I thought we were winning , Scully . - I know you did , Mulder . I 'm here to see Father Joe . I wanna show him these photographs of these men . You still wanna believe him . I think you should know that he 's been diagnosed with a terminal illness . He has advanced-stage lung cancer . I just wanna be sure . Then let me ask him . You wouldn 't believe ... I was thinking of you . I had a vision you might find interesting . Of a man speaking a foreign language . Did he happen to look like this ? Yeah . That 's the man . How did you know ? We think he 's the man who abducted the FBI agent and the second woman you say you saw and possibly many more . And we think that he was helped by this man . - I don 't know who that is . - Are you sure ? I 'm fairly certain . I don 't know him . I 'm fairly certain that you do . And that you 've known him since he was a boy . Oh , no . It can 't be true . I don 't believe this . He was my connection to the girl . My visions were to save her from him . This is God 's work . This is God 's work . Let me ask you one more question , Father Joe . The FBI agent the first woman that you saw , Monica Bannan is she still alive ? I feel her . Yes . She 's still alive . - Mulder . - That second victim may be alive . Everybody 's given up , but I 'm not going to . Mulder , you think I don 't understand , but I do . This stubbornness of yours , it 's why I fell in love with you . It 's like you said . And it 's why we can 't be together . Whoa , hold up . - Hey . Hey , sorry to bother you . - I 'm closed . - No , I just need a moment of your time . - We 've got some bad weather coming in . You 'd better get wherever you 're going fast . So , what do you need ? Yeah , I was wondering if you carry an animal tranquilizer called acepromazine ? - You got a prescription for it ? - No , I don 't . Well , I can 't sell it to you , then . Can you tell me if you 've ever sold any to this man ? - I am never getting out of here . - I 'm just ... Nutter 's Feed . Yep , I was just closing up and I 'm gonna pick him up . Yeah . Goodbye . Yeah . - What happened to the other guy ? - Who ? The guy who was standing right here . I need to refill this now . Okay . - Yeah , it 's me . - Shit . I must be busy right now . Leave a message . Mulder , I just found something in my stem-cell research . Experiments being done in Russia on dogs , Mulder . I think that 's what your suspects have been doing , only on humans . Those women who 've been abducted ... You 've got to call me . Mulder , the FBI agent 's alive . FBI Special Agent in Charge Fossa speaking . It 's for you . - This is Special Agent Drummy . - I 've been trying to find you for hours . I can 't reach Mulder . - Is this Dr. Scully ? - Yes , it 's Dr. Scully . - Well , where is he ? - If I knew that , I wouldn 't be calling . Dr. Scully , I 'm gonna suggest you call the police . This is not an FBI matter . Listen to me . I need your help . I 'm sorry , I can 't help you . Then let me talk to someone with some balls , who can . No , don 't touch me ! Don 't touch me ! You 're going to be fine . I 've taken care of it . I 've taken good care of it . You don 't need this one anymore . Look at me . You 're going to live . You 're going to have a fine , strong body . Down . Down . Excuse me . - I 'm Dana Scully and that 's my car . - Right . I talked to some bigwig at the FBI . Called from Washington . Yeah . That 's him . Walter Skinner . Is there any indication what happened ? Or any footprints ? Nothing . Snow 's pretty heavy . But we did find this . You might want to give it to him . Excuse me . His cell phone , it 's got blood on it . Listen to me . Calm down . Stop and think . He 's okay . He 's gotta be . He climbed out of there . If he climbed out , he probably climbed up . Stop . Back off . Back away . Back off ! Do you speak English ? Do you speak English ? Anybody speak English ? I want her out of here . I want those tubes out of her neck and I want her neck sewn up . Do it ! We will find him . I know Mulder . He 'd get to a phone and call first . He didn 't do anything crazy . Not overly crazy . Wait a minute . Back up . Stop . What is it ? Proverbs 25 : 2 . The glory of God to hide a thing . I 've got it . It 's an invoice for medical supplies to a Dr. Uroff-Koltoff . It 's an address on Bellflower Road . - Listen . - What ? Dogs . Dogs . Hey ! Mulder . Can you hear me ? Sorry about your car . The girl is still inside . Show me your hands ! Show me your hands ! Put the scalpel down ! Put the scalpel down ! Just get it down or I 'll blow your goddamn hand off ! Get over there ! God , what have you done ? What have you done ? Mulder needs warm clothes and fluids . Oh , God . I 've got work to do here . Get in ! Get in ! All right , Mulder . - The girl inside ... - Scully 's got her . She 's in good hands . - Skinner ? - Yeah . Cold . I got you . I got you . Mulder ? What 's up , doc ? Father Joe is dead . He was clearly a very sick man . Did you see this story ? The FBI is claiming Father Joe was an accomplice . Not a word about his psychic connection . He 's dead , Mulder . - We 'll never know . - I know , Scully , and I can prove it . Father Joe died of lung cancer , right ? The same as that man that Dr. Frankenstein tried to give a new body . What time did you pull tubes from that woman 's neck ? What time did you cut blood to that man 's head ? That 's when Father Joe died . Get me his death certificate . I 'll take it to the FBI and I 'll show them . Do you think they 're really gonna take your call ? It 's an injustice to the man 's name . Well , considering his crimes against those young boys who is really gonna care ? - I thought you believed him too . I wanted to believe him . I did believe him . I acted on that belief . Why don 't you just tell me what he said to you ? He told me : " Don 't give up . " And I didn 't . And it saved your life . But I 've put that boy through hell . And I have another surgery scheduled for this morning because I believed that God was telling me to . Through a pedophile priest , no less . What if Father Joe 's prayers were answered after all ? What if he were forgiven ? Because he didn 't give up . Try proving that one , Mulder . I 'm due at the hospital . Scully ? Why would he say that ? " Don 't give up . " Why would he say such a thing to you ? I think that was meant for you , Mulder . He didn 't say it to me . He said it to you . If Father Joe were the devil why would he say the opposite of what the devil might say ? Maybe that 's the answer . The larger answer . What do you mean ? Don 't give up . Please don 't make this any harder than it already is . It 's okay . If you have any doubts any doubts at all just call off that surgery this morning . And then we 'll get out of here . Just me and you . As far away from the darkness as we can get ? I 'm not sure it works that way . I think maybe the darkness finds you and me . I know it does . But let it try . Are you ready to begin , Dr. Scully ? Yes .

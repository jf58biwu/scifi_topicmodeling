 JACK : Previously on Kings ... KING 'S OWN : David Shepherd , you 're under arrest . On what charge ? Treason . I 'm pregnant . Your father , he has eyes for David 's blood . King Silas framed this entire case . You 're a traitor . You 're both traitors . We act now . You did that ? For me ? I Iove you . The group will be meeting to consider the season . Do it . ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) Silas is dead . Jack will be King . His first order will be to avenge his father 's murder . Don 't do this , Jack . I know it , he 's alive . Jack has named himself King , Cross is the real power . I am the King . MALE ANNOUNCER ON RADIO : King Silas offered his hand in peace and Gath bit it . Killing innocent civilians , murdering our King and , very nearly , his successor . Prince Regent Jack Benjamin is alive and well and will be crowned sovereign . And while I can ' t give details , be sure that Gath ' s betrayal will not go unanswered . ( SIGHING ) Four of our generals and now our press minister , all loyal to us . Where one loyalist falls , ten others will beg you for their position . You 're very popular , Jack . It 's a message . My father 's still alive , and his teeth are still sharp . The panicked bite of a dying dog , probably dead already . ( SIGHING ) Just feels like he could just come back anytime . He 's not coming back . He 's one man against an army that answers to us . You 've been afraid of your father your whole life . Now might be a safe time to grow a pair and flaunt them . I can only put the crown in front of you . They need to see you take it . Sir . MALE ANNOUNCER ON RADIO : In response to the assassination of King Silas ... Sir , you should hear this . Public opinion now firmly in favor of military action with a reengagement of hostilities with Gath seen as a ... ( RADIO SIGNAL DISTORTING ) SILAS : People of Gilboa . A few days ago , our nation was a victim of a coup d 'Ã©tat . Your King was shot and the reins of our country seized by corrupt and evil men . My people , you have been deceived . I address you today to say that I , Silas Benjamin , King of Gilboa , am alive . Very much alive . I am still sovereign of this nation . I send a message to the traitors who would depose me , who would subvert God 's will and the freedom of my people . I am the rightful King of this nation . I and no other . I will return to Shiloh to take my place , given me by God and citizen . Like an earthquake , I will come . Silas is still alive . I told you he was tougher than any bullet . What did I say ? I said ... Well , he 's got Shepherd and Thomasina with him . Yeah . ( EXHALING ) So , are they still gonna have the ceremony ? Is Jack gonna take the crown ? He just had them polish it . He wants to be the new King . But we still have an old King . Can we have two Kings ? Oh , boy . ( SIGHING ) A man with much to consider . My whole life , I 've waited for this moment , my chance to lead , to impress my personality on a country and make it better . Tomorrow it happens , but I don 't feel anything . It 's not there . You mean , he is not there . Shouldn 't he give me something ? Words of wisdom , or a warning , an image for a new standard ? My father had signs . Butterflies , whole conversations , whatever , to give him the confidence to speak in his name . What 's my blessing ? God does not take counsel with sinners . Recently , you and I , we 've been made unforgivable . We both knew my father needed to go . And all the others ? AII the innocents shot dead ? Your declaration of war . That 's William . We allowed it . Silas was right . I cannot accuse him and let myself go unscrutinized . I can make good of our mistakes . Once you put the crown on my head , you will see how well it fits . That crown will never touch your head . That is the hollowness that you feel , and you know it . He knows it . And he will never speak to you . Why not ? You are not the one he wants . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) Jack . That 's enough . There will be no more debate on primacy . Silas ' threats are empty . We have the chance to rid ourselves of a tyrant . I 'II be crowned , as scheduled , in a touching ceremony to warm every patriotic heart . But , sir , if Silas is alive , he 's still King . ( GUN FIRING ) ( PEOPLE GASPING ) Does anyone else stand opposed ? You are worse than he ever was . Is this who you are now ? ( INHALING ) You 're gonna shoot me , too ? If you don 't sit . You could have been better , Jack . You 'II have to shoot both of us . Get them out of here ! Keep them under watch . You never do that again . Jack and William are wrong . I won 't pretend otherwise . Yes , you will . Until Silas returns , and then you will pretend even more . The fate of this monarchy , this family , no Ionger lies with your brother . Jack will die the moment Silas returns . And if Silas and David don 't return ? I know your father . He 'II come . And you have to stay alive long enough to greet him with open arms . You keep your head down , your mouth shut . You tell no one of this pregnancy , especially David . You 'II have nothing to fear . I 'II take care of everything . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Everything 's set . You can drink with people you hate . Life 's taught me that much . Come on . Might be your last . ( SIGHING ) So that 's it , then ? We die tomorrow . Odds are not in our favor . Not like the old days . Then , I was sure . I 'd ask the outcome of a battle and he 'd answer in thunder , and the answer would always be yes . No answer tonight ? Not for some time . Hey , maybe we can help you out a Iittle . Just let us know you 're listening out there , and that you exist , and that you care a Iittle for the back and forth-ings of we tiny men , and that success or death in the outcome of battle mean a Iittle out there in the sparkly quintessence . Just knock the glass over . An infant could do it , a breeze . No ? I guess we 're on our own . Maybe he doesn 't talk to bastards . And here I thought we were getting along so well . I know you too well now . I 'II help you tomorrow . I 'II probably die , too . But I 'II do it because the people need you . They have a chance at peace with you . If we do survive , I owe you more than apologies . I wronged you . The minute I see you in your chair , I 'm out of here . I don 't want to see any of you again . Do that . Just promise me one thing . If God ever does speak to you again , you 'II listen . Don 't . Curfew has been established across all Shiloh . Streets are secure , every roof and corner . No signs of any disturbance . Sir ? Reverend Samuels . He won 't come for the coronation . He knows I 'II kill him for this . He said he expects it . Fine . Send a team . Meet his expectation . Sir , what about the benediction ? You do it . ( WHISPERING ) How can the crown be missing ? It 's a national treasure , blessed and locked in a vault . The National Archives has arranged an alternate . A false crown and no Reverend . Don 't worry about him . Samuels has already recognized you in public . You 're still his magically approved choice . This is happening , Jack . You 'II be King in an hour . Try to enjoy it . ( BOY CHANTING ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( MAN SHOUTING ) ( CROWD CHANTING ) ( CHANTING STOPS ) I read from the benediction of the Reverend Ephraim Samuels . " Our cause is just . " Our union is perfect . " As we unified our lands , " unify our purpose . " Forgive my eyes for what they have overlooked . Forgive my mouth for its pride . Forgive these hands for works done and works unfinished . If I die today , I die knowing my offense . HANSON : " Guide his eyes , mouth , hands " that they see your goals , speak your words , " build monuments to your gifts . " Still think he 's coming ? Only let me live long enough to see my wrongs righted . I have walked before you from the time of my youth . Here I am . ( GUN FIRING ) ( GUNS COCKING ) Let this crown be our every hand . There to lift you up in darkest moments . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) HANSON : Do what your hand finds to do . Stand aside . What ? HANSON : He 's with you . Don 't let him through . Shoot him . SOLDIER ON RADIO : Orders are to fire . Prepare to fire . ( GUNS COCKING ) ( TANKS APPROACHING ) ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) It 's Gath . No . It 's him . Oh , William . Bringing guns to a tank battle ? Jack , come on . Stand aside ! Do not fire ! Find my son ! Bring him to the airfield ! If you would see peace with Gath and war ended , stand aside ! Husband . Wife . I believe this is yours . Where 's our son ? You were going to put this on Jack ? Sir ... Say there was a gun to your head , and I won 't have to put one there . So , where are they ? William Cross , Jack Benjamin , where are they ? I ask once more with words , and then with blood . ( DOOR OPENING ) JACK : I 'm here . I 'm not going to run . Not anymore . You said I couldn 't be what I was . God said I couldn 't be what I wanted . There 's nothing left for me but to die . Do it . Go on . Finish it . I 'm ready . We can think of worse things for you than death . You could have had everything . Everyone out . ( MUMBLING ) ( PANTS ) The plane is waiting , we have to move ! Not without my son ! Silas is closing the roads ! He 'II find us . We have to go now ! ( SIGHS ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Sir , we found Cross . He was just standing in the lobby , waiting for us . Where 's your father , Andrew ? His plan was to fly to the Calsays . He had a ship there waiting for him , to take him to a home on the southernmost tip . When I came back , my father told me to watch and learn , so I did . I Iearned who should be King , and who shouldn 't . Anything else ? You lost a son . I lost a father . Maybe I could be part of the family . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) David . You 're leaving ? ( SIGHS ) AII I did was replace one corrupt king for another . You stopped a war ! Who knows how many lives you saved ? I can 't live here . Back home , things were either right or wrong . David ! Hey ... We can go away together . What about your family ? You are my family . You really mean it ? You can leave everything behind for me ? You stood by me when your blood took another side . I 'd reward that , anything you ask . No . No need . But there were others . Kept their heads down , did nothing . I would Iike to see that they are sanctioned . ( SIGHS ) ( THUNDER CRASHING ) It 's you . Silas ? ( RUMBLING CONTINUES ) Not bad , right ? Even you must be impressed today . ( RUMBLING CONTINUES ) You 're welcome . I give and I 'm thankful , for giving is a need . We understand each other on the point . It was a mad idea you had in the first place . Kings , a monarchy , in this day and age ? I 'm looking out at a city that I built in your name . This is what you wanted . Deny it ? Then you can forgive me . Then , I still have some role yet to play . ( THUNDER CRASHES ) Oh , thank you . Thank you ! Whatever you want ! I am ready ! Him ? But why ? No . No , what about me ? What am I supposed to do ? Don 't go ! Don 't go ! Sir . Find Shepherd . Bring him to the mansion . Tell him I listened . Sir . Captain . ( SIGHS ) DAVID : You said I could go home . You were asked for . It seems God has plans other than you might have wanted . Get used to that . He spoke to me again . He told me you were meant to take my place . Me ? No . No , I 'm no king . It 's not up to you either . But why ? I don 't know why . Because you 're good . I 've been good . Because you 're young . I was young , too . Oh , I gave him that . Everything he ever asked for . But now he turns away , loves you . I don 't know that he does . You have his favor ! I doubt I could have escaped the traps I laid for you . You never knew what you were being given . But now , now I see . How long has he been whispering in your ear ? He hasn 't . ( SCOFFS ) You didn 't feel anything , huh ? Before your butterfly crown ? After ? Don 't lie to me ! I never asked for anything . He did come to you . Offered himself behind my back . Yours for the taking . Shameful . The two of you laughing at me . No . God loved you , and so did I ! ( GROANS ) I listened to your lies while you were playing me ! The old fool , huh ? Is that what you thought , huh ? Is that what you thought ? God looked me in the eye and lied to me like a backstabbing , cheating whore ! ( CHOKING ) You 're jealous ! That 's why he left you . Maybe I should be King ! Maybe I should ! ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) David ? What happened ? He 'II never let us go . Ever . MICHELLE : Reverend ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GROANS ) Reverend ! Reverend ! Here I am . I didn 't know where else to take him . Silas did this to you ? He thinks I 've stolen God 's favor . You haven 't , David . God gave it freely . I don 't want it . David Shepherd , son of Jessie , son of Judah , know this ... You were chosen to be the new King . It 's true , isn 't it ? Where can I take him ? His only place of refuge , you cannot follow . Gath . Silas would never look for you there . Gath ? ( SIGHS ) I 'II be alone . I 'II have nothing . You need fear no evil . You , David , are never alone . As long as we 're together , you 'II be in danger . I can 't risk you . You have to stay here . Take this . ( SNIFFLING ) Wear it . And know that I will always love you , no matter what . always know that . I will never stop loving you . Ever . I 'II be back for you . I 'II be waiting . SAMUELS : Husband and wife , if you Iike . Vows of love exchanged before God . You two were married long ago , and you will be married forevermore . ( DOOR UNLOCKING ) I pictured prison colder . She had no part in this . Her part , she 'II be glad to play . Your father wants for you a living death . To brick you into a wall with someone who loves you , who you can 't stand the sight of , until you produce an heir , which Silas will take and raise right this time . LUCINDA : I ... Don 't understand . Thomasina , love ... ( SIGHS ) please . You 've known me since I could crawl . You went against the family . You 're not charming anymore , Jack . Don 't do this . It 's not so hard . Just close your eyes and dream of someone who 's dead . Mother , I ... Oh . An issuance of the King . For her acts of treason in support of her brother , Michelle Benjamin is ordered exiled from Gilboa , stripped of any rights as citizen or noble , removed from all our lands , and kept from any company but her own for a period of no less than one year . What are you talking about ? ( WHISPERING ) I told you I would take care of everything . AII our plans . We 'II make new ones . We 'II be young again . Everything there is to fight for began with you . You 're the stone-center . You 're Silas . Yes . And nothing can take the future from this family . Nothing . Least of all David Shepherd . Let him go , Silas . I will find David , I will hunt him down , and when his dead body lays at my feet , I 'II come for you for your part in this . Killing David will not keep you King . At least God will know I 'm angry . He 's gone , Silas , where you cannot find him . His family is safe , too . Nothing can stop God 's plan . I travel that path no more . I 'm a sinner now . He wants peace , I want war . God and I are now constant enemies . Then I bring a message from the enemy . Do not search too hard for my servant , for the day you lay a hand on him will be the day that you die . Oh , is that what he says ? Well , take a message back to him . We are at war ! ( PANTING )

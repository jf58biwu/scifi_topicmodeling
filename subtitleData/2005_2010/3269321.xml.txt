 Previously on New Amsterdam the shaman told me i 'd feel it here , in my heart . What did you say your name was ? John Amsterdam . You meet your true love and then die ? Do you believe in true love ? I 've waited a very long time for this . Omar : doesn 't sound too romantic to me . Tell me about your family . Not much to tell . Sara , I 'd like you to meet omar . You really marquez ' kid ? He 's a real putz . Hope it 's not genetic . Matter of fact , it is . Your father buried it . He wanted to protect you . I googled you . no . I can 't be with you , john . Tell me you 're not hiding something . The truth is , i 'm 400 years old . The truth is omar is my son , one of 63 children I 've fathered . John . I 'm immortal . They 're not . The truth is- - Stop ! Just stop . Good morning , dr . Dillane . Fifth message . Clearly the whole 400-year-old thing didn 't go over so well . I know I can sound like I don 't care . Trust me , I do . Down to my bones . I said what I said because- - Love in the electronic age . What have we gotten ourselves into ? Seen eva ? Yeah , she 's by the elevators . With a man . Older . As I 've said to her--you know , your lives , I don 't care . Eva and i , we understand each other . She just doesn 't know it yet . Got a fresh case . Chinatown . Hmm . Land of low clearance . You know , Amsterdam , you and I should some time , because I like to show a human face . And not a bad one , I might add , before I show another one . I 've been through a million bosses . They all died happy . I 'm not done . Well , I am . I 'm not having this fight with you anymore . You need to understand , I 've got my own life . You don 't walk away from me . I think you should take your hands off her . I 've got this , Amsterdam . Now . I don 't need your help . I feel like helping . Help yourself . Walk away . He 's my father . Eddie marquez . Chief marquez to you . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't know . I 'm john Amsterdam . Uh , her partner . Yeah , yeah , how ya doing ? I hear you run brooklyn north . Bed-stuy . That 's a tough watch . Yeah , well , I guess after the eight-one , you 'll go through any door . And you 'll go first . You 're your daughter 's father . We gotta go . Eva , we 're up . We 'll continue this later . All right ? I hope not . Hey , take care of her . Do not , ever , under any circumstances , think you 're taking care of me . Furthest thing from my mind . It 's just--my dad and i , we have problems . What about your parents ? I 'm an orphan . That would explain a lot . Family . It gets you coming and going . Where are we ? Right in there . Thanks . You considering a career in urban planning ? Masonic triangle . Symbol of the triads . Forefathers of the chinatown tongs . Could be the killer 's trying to tell us something . I don 't know what the killer 's telling you . But this body 's telling me he 's caucasian , 21 , took a few to the chest . Blood spatter consistent with body position . Can I smoke ? no . 1913 greenwich village long day ? Endless . It 's only the armory show . And I 've got nothing . There 'll be other shows , my love . Remember hokusai ? The japanese painter ? He said nothing he did before he 70 meant anything . It takes time , dutch . 200 years isn 't enough ? 200 ? Well , then maybe you should consider another line of work . Get out . Dutch , we 've paid her for the day . Excuse me . I 'm a professional . I 've posed for real painters . You be quiet . Out ! now ! Dutch . Dutch , dutch , put it down . Put it down ! What are you doing ? Dad ! Dad ! What ? You know this guy ? A Robbo Upload I got a call from organized crime . They want in on the chinatown investigation . Why ? They like general tso 's chicken . What do you care ? Give them the case . There 's plenty more where that came from . They can 't have it . You don 't even have an id on the vic , we 're close . Yeah , so is jupiter if you 're on mars . I want this case , sarge . Motivation . All right . I like it . I 'll go talk dirty to the feds , buy you a couple more days . Is there anything you want to tell me ? My life 's an open book . That 's what I thought . Is it me or are john does the fastest growing segment of the population ? Any identifying marks ? Six bullet holes . One exit wound . We 're probably looking at five rounds . Aside from the little setback of being dead , he 's pretty healthy . No needle marks . Liver 's a nice rust color . Pink lungs . I got a joke for you . A dyslexic walks into a bra ... A bra . See , he 's dyslexic . Things criss-cross ... Forget it . Homework ? What subject ? It was in the world . It 's called a crossword puzzle . They give you clues and the answers crisscross . Clever . Sorry about today , rosie . Losing my temper . You should tell that to mother , not me . Oh , I already did . It 's just ... I 'm a painter . It comes with the territory . I have something in my mind . When I can 't get it on the canvas , it makes me crazy . That 's not an excuse . You 're right , it isn 't . Why ? Why is it so important ? Mozart 's requiem . He wrote it over a hundred years ago . People still listen to it . They 'll listen to it forever . It 's our connection to the past and the future . I don 't care about mozart . It 's just old . You 're young , it probably seems that way . But I 've been around a while . And I can tell you this , art links us over time . Everyone who 's ever heard mozart or will ever hear it , we 're all connected . You understand ? Don 't know him . What else ? You 've got exactly one minute . Help us out , detective . No one knows chinatown like you do . I know what I know . 50 seconds . Give us a break . Think I stand around all day and do interviews ? 40 seconds . I get made , I end up in the river . How long you work undercover ? Don 't ask him . Did a 10-year stint in the cia . We think this is a gang beef . Everybody down here wants to be a gangster . Coke deal on mott went south last week . Guy ran his whole magazine . He just had a bad temper . A.d.d. Or something . This kid was killed in a building owned by donald chen . This is all chen 's territory . Made his name by inviting another tong leader to a peacemaking dinner and shooting him in the head . You sneeze down here , chen knows about it . Time 's up . It 's Amsterdam . I need you to run a dna profile on a homicide victim and compare it to a second sample from a possible family member . Yeah . I will do . Thanks . What the hell 's that ? Family tree . The kid who was murdered , I think he was one of mine . That 's some dense foliage . This branch stops around 1910 ... With my son rosie . Looks like he didn 't have any children . Or he did and I lost track of them . I didn 't think you lost track of anyone . You know ! how certain things in your life , you wish you 'd tended to better ? Thank you . Thank you , roosevelt , for being such a big help and let me know if we need more wine . Oh , sacha , maria , welcome . We 're still setting up . Let 's get you some wine . Why don 't you say hello to dutch ? So , dutch ... I understand this is your cheering-up party . Yeah . Is it working ? What do you think ? Maybe you should read the masses . It 's going to change everything . Change is rare and slow . You want change ? You should exhibit in my gallery . It 'd make it easier to get you into the armory show . The work isn 't ready . It never is . You 're going in some interesting directions . Well , I should have arrived by now . Each painting is worse than the last . Now I paint out of curiosity to see how bad it can get . It isn 't bad . It 's just stiff . Constrained . It isn 't free . Perhaps like the artist . Dutch , this is alice crayborn . She 's a modern dancer . The next isadora . There 's only one isadora . And she has a very bad habit of speaking her mind . That could get you into trouble . So I 've been told . Any wine , dutch ? No , no . So how would a dancer feel about ... Sitting still ? Looking to pin the butterfly ? Hello . I 'm dutch 's wife . Samantha . This is alice . My new model . Hey , sara . I 'm on a new cell phone plan : unlimited rejection . We got a hit on your john doe 's fingerprints . He 's a skell ? He has a record ? Department of education . He was a teacher 's aide . Yeah . A cop with no gun . This is special agent lawson , fbi . I can tell by the shoes . He 's with the organized crime task force . I thought we agreed , this is our case . It still is . But the rules of the game have changed . Your vic 's name is alex spoor . You may know his family . They 've got a little brewery in brooklyn . Solid new england stock . Here 's a sample of some of their most recent work . A crime family . Born and bred . We 've had them under investigation for three years . Harry morton , labor boss , garroted in his car . Elsie gennaro , 68 . Apparently she saw something she wasn 't supposed to , stabbed in the heart . Yeah , we get the picture . If the chinese killed alex spoor , all hell 's gonna break loose . A gang war . I thought he was trying to become a teacher . Doesn 't matter if he was studying to become a nun . He 's one of them . You can 't escape who you are . Hey , you 're 400 . What you in training for ? It 's a release . Of course , now that you and sara have done the deed , maybe you are mortal . In which case , you better be careful . Well , if she 's the one , then where the hell is she ? The shaman didn 't say much about voice mail . What 's the story with the dead kid ? Alex spoor ? Yeah . Well , it turns out he 's part of a violent crime family . My family . Somehow this branch went bad and it started with me . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! It 's my family , too . People are people . If I took responsibility for everything you did , i 'd never get out of bed in the morning . It 's like , 200 years ago you beat up somebody in a bar . And today , one of his descendants blows up a building . You can say it 's not your fault , but you 're connected to it . It 's the butterfly effect . A butterfly flaps its wings in india , and you don 't get your wine shipment . Except with me , it happens over time . Most people don 't live long enough to see it . Because we only live one life . One life is just the blink of an eye . So who am I supposed to be ? In your painting ? You 're an odalisque . What 's that ? She 's a virgin slave girl in a harem . If an odalisque does well , she could become a concubine . Really . Mmm . Must be nice to be king . Sultan . How 's the work ? Fine . You need anything ? no . My god . This is really extraordinary . I was going to make lunch . I don 't want to break . Maybe for alice . no . She looks better hungry . Well , here they are . The downside of procreation . It begins with the o spoor . What about his father ? That 's as far back as we go . But you can always ask the old man . He 's still around . Nicholas made his name taking over the brooklyn docks . Killed a baker 's dozen doing it . Most of that traffic runs through jersey now . The spoors have diversified . Drugs , prostitution , counterfeit goods . Piers spoor , the middle brother , killed a few months ago in a gangland hit . Still unsolved . Sounds like a war is already on . What do you have on alex ? Whatever alex was into , he was flying too low for our radar . What 's the connection to chinatown ? Are the spoors making a move ? Well , like I said , they 're versatile . I can 't comment any further . You can 't comment ? This isn 't a press conference , is it ? Since alex died , there 's been a lot of chatter on the wire about the chens . Any of that " chatter " involve a name ? The name is chen . I 'll give you what I can , detective . Last time I checked , we were all on the same team . That 's my brother . I 'm sorry , Mr. Spoor , we have to ask you sooe questions . What can you tell us about alex ? Anyone he had problems with ? We know this is a difficult time , but the more information we get , the faster we get it , the faster our chances are . Do you think I care about your chances , detective ? Like she said , it 's a bad time . We need your help . You need to clear a case , that 's all . This was my brother . We 'll get whoever killed alex . I don 't want to get him . I want to kill him . I 've got a yen for chinese . You start a gang war , blood will run in the streets . Theirs and yours . Do you want to lose more family ? I 've already lost two brothers . And my family 's not your business . Well , that 's where you 're wrong . What do you care ? Let 's just say I have a personal interest . Now , we 'll get whoever did it . But I need you to let us do our job . One week . I don 't make deals . It 's not a deal . It 's a promise . You ever wonder why so many new york tenements are six stories high ? Water flowing from the upstate reservoirs will go that high unassisted . Otherwise , you need a water tower or a separate pump . You really annoy me sometimes . Ladies , nypd homicide . Do you recognize this man ? You 've never seen this guy before ? no . You recognize this man ? Excuse me . You ever seen this guy before ? No . Never . Do you recognize this man ? no . Talk about blue wall . We 've hit the great wall . On the contrary . Nypd . No speak . You speak fine . All the tourists understand you . Maybe we should take a look inside . You need warrant . You steered us in . I was shocked to find illegal counterfeit merchandise . Ever seen this guy before ? Huh ? You know dooald chen ? Mr. Chen good man . Good man is he ? You 've been asking about Mr. Chen ? Is that a crime ? He 's flying in from hong kong ! tonight . He will answer your questions at the midnight restaurant . 10 : 00 . Charming man . 10 : 00 . Can I talk to you ? You 're a detective . If someone doesn 't return your calls , it 's a clue . What do I need to do to make this right ? I asked what was going on with you , and you handed me a fairy tale about being 400 years old . Ok , I get it . There are things in your past you can 't talk about . It 's complicated . I know about complicated . I was married to a reporter who worked 90 hours a week and called me every day to tell me he loved me . Turned out he was in chelsea sleeping with a former assistant he was putting through fashion school . Now she has her own line . It isn 't going to happen to me again . That 's not what I meant by complicated . Look , something is happening between us . I know that , but I have an aversion to being lied to . So just answer me this : have you ever cheated on anyone ? What happened , happened a long time ago . This time it 's different . Is it ? Or is it different every time you do it ? Rosie ! Rosie ! I thought you were at school . Rosie , this thing with alice , it ... It just happened . It doesn 't mean anything . It didn 't " just happen " . You made it happen . You can 't understand . Why do we have to live like this ? That girl . She 's ... She 's five years older than I am . We 're--this isn 't a family . It may not be the family you want , but it 's the one you 've got . You 're right . I don 't want it . Rosie . Rosie . Whatever happens , you 're my son . You always will be . I like it . The darkness . In the old days , before edison ... You used fire . I know . Mr. Chen . Detectives marquez and Amsterdam . Nothing for us . I understand dining with you can be hazardous to one 's health . Mr. Chen , you probably know why we 're here . Alex spoor was murdered on your turf . If there 's a gang war , it will turn this place into a ghost town . It 'll kill your business interests . So we need to know what you know . You remember the tong wars ? Turn of the century . The hip sing tong , the four brothers . Must have been the year of the rat . Your great-grandfather was a police informant . But the thing is , they 're all gone now . All of them , forgotten . You want to be remembered , donny ? Do you want a legacy ? Be a peacemaker . How did you know about my great-grandfather ? No one knows that . I 'm a cop . As for the spoors , I don 't kill boys . When it 's time to cut , I sever the head . Get down ! Everybody , down ! Eva , you ok ? Of course . The feds . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Sorry . It 's a family gathering . Theo spoor . Mr. Spoor , he 's a cop . Do we know each other ? We might have known someone in common . [ speaking dutch ] let him in . We have nothing to hide . Five days left . Went to talk to chen last night . Funny thing . While we were there , somebody shot up his restaurant . What 's that have to do with me ? You tell me . I don 't operate that way . No ? I 've seen how you operate . I 'm a homicide detective . My best friend is that man right there . You ? I could care less about . Well , my day is ruined . Look , I can tell you where I was , who I was with . But that 's just conversation . I could have ordered it done . But I didn 't . Now , I 've done things you could never understand , but I never break my word . Ever . I understand alex had a girlfriend . He liked the quiet ones . Just not here . Not today . I think it 's extraordinary . Your best . Do you love her ? It 's just work . Please , dutch . Don 't insult me . All I know is that ever since she arrived , I can paint again . I did that for you once . You still do . Let 's--let 's move out of the village . Lead a normal life . It 'll be better for rosie . You mean for you . Yes . I don 't belong here anymore . Look at me , my hair 's gone gray . I want different things . You--you look and act the same as the moment we met . I don 't want to lose you . Then you 're going to have to make a choice , aren 't you ? We i.d. ' d the drive-by shooters at chen 's . Made a partial plate to a rival chinese gang . Ballistics matched some of their previous work . Spoor was telling the truth . Well , nobody lies all the time . Amsterdam . How was the wake ? Bet the beer was good . You went to see spoor alone ? I was in the neighborhood . You sure you weren 't " taking care of me " ? Partners . It 's like marriage without the makeup sex . What can we do for you ? Picked up something I thought would interest you . Wing storage down on mott ? Alex kept a locker down there . Well , you can 't blame the kid . With what they pay teachers these days . So the spoors were moving in on chen . Trying to get in on the counterfeit trade . That 's motive . Maybe . oh . These are good . What do you think ? Gina . Thanks for coming in . When I talked to you over the phone , I realized it was important . It is . Because you have the totally wrong idea . Alex was no criminal . Think we got that idea opening his locker full of bootleg merchandise . I don 't care if you found a dozen faberge eggs . I know him . Alex and I were together for three years . You 're aware of his family . Of course . Every christmas , they all watch the godfather and argue about who is which brother . It 's pathetic . Alex hated all that . Hated ? Well , he loved his brothers , but he hated the life . He was trying to get away and build something that would last . But when his brother was killed , everything changed . Piers ? Alex wouldn 't say much about it . But it was eating him up . It 's such a waste . Alex would have been a wonderful teacher . What part of " confidential source " don 't you understand ? What do you care where the tip came from ? It was solid . A little too solid . Could be somebody wants to lay this at chen 's door . Somebody who wants a war . Like who ? You 're a trained investigator , Amsterdam . Let the evidence lead you where it leads you . Don 't outsmart yourself . You 've been investigating the spoors for three years , you have nothing on alex . Then suddenly , out of nowhere , you get a tip on a locker filled with counterfeit merchandise ? Sometimes you get lucky . Woman : agent lawson ? Tell me about piers spoor 's death . Gangland hit . Probably a rival outfit . Alex 's girlfriend said that everything changed after that . What did she mean ? Maybe alex was sensitive . Maybe you 're protecting something . Maybe you should walk away . Why ? You have someone on the inside ? Was this kid working for you ? Is that why he was killed ? Someone found out he was on the payroll ? Here 's an idea : you do your job , we 'll do ours . Is that a yes ? No , detective . That 's a no . Lawson 's a fed . If he 's been working this board for three years , he 's heard everything that 's been said in that brewery . He 's got them on a wire . Electronic surveillance , 24 / 7 . I mean , he 's got to know more than he says . I 'm just going to put something on that wire . We 'll see what happens . Unless you got a better idea . no ? I didn 't think so . Are you an art lover ? My great-great-grandfather was a painter . Walked out on his family . Or so the story goes . You never know with stories . Over her . Don 't drink . You 're bad for my business . Tell me , what made you decide to become a cop , anyway ? I saw too many people get away with it . Man , you 're really bad for my business . We found out who shot up chen 's restaurant . You come here to apologize ? We think we 're about to break the case . Really . Found this witness in chinatown who saw the killing . One of those ladies who steers tourists in to buy knock-offs . She 's coming in tomorrow . She tell you what she saw ? It wasn 't the chens . She could be working for them . We don 't think so . She was pretty specific . You 'll keep me informed ? You 'll be the first to know . I told you I 'd find the killer , nick . Like you , I keep my word . It 's a family thing . What witness ? You knowow it is , lawson . We have to protect our sources . Did I come through loud and clear ? We have been working on this investigation for three years . And yes , we do work holidays , and you can 't control this cowboy ? Seems to me all he 's doing is investigating a homicide . We 're supposed to be on the same team here . Team ? You 've got a wire on those people and you haven 't given us spit . We give you what we can . What about that tip on alex 's stash ? Was crap . The whole thing smelled . You better watch your ass , my friend . One step over the line , i 'm gonna have your badge . Maybe you 'd like to come over here and take it off me . Oh , boy , a measuring contest . We love when you do that . Eva , what have you got ? I 'm not going to burn a source . This case could have serious implications on our investigation . I want the name of this witness . And I want the name of alex spoor 's killer . Circle game . Lots of fun . Special agent lawson , as of right now , we don 't have a name for you . John , take a few days off . Go home . What witness ? No one . I made it up . I am so glad I could take one for you . And you did that , why ? I knew lawson had a wire inside . I wanted to see if he 'd react . If he ignored the bait , fine . But if he didn 't , then he has something or someone he 's protecting . He bit . You think he knows who killed alex ? Alex 's girlfriend said that he hated what his family did . What if the feds flipped him ? What if he was wired ? You think the murder 's on tape ? There was no wire on the body . We need access to those tapes . We 'd have to get a court order . Maybe I 'll go see some family instead . Amsterdam . You saw spoor without me again . Why ? It was personal . You did know alex spoor , didn 't you ? Yes . And no . Samantha ? Rosie ? The gods have smiled . The armory show . They liked my work . I bought wine . Samantha ? Rosie ? Dna work . Pronounced similarity in genetic markers ... Alex spoor was family . Not like you didn 't suspect it . To alex . To alex . A descendent of my wayward father . Sorry we never knew you . Your wife and your son , why didn 't you go after them , john ? Try and see them ? And say what ? I knew I 'd have to leave them sooner or later . Better they left me . Amsterdam ? Thought you were going to visit family . I didn 't say whose family . Hey , dad . Your partner came to me with a problem . I think I can help . Whatever clears the case . See ? I told you she 'd understand . I 'm not talking to you . Maybe I owe my little girl one . I 'm not your little girl , dad . Not anymore . I 'm a cop . I work my ass off trying to get a tiny bit of respect . And then you tell my partner to take care of me ? Everything I 've been trying to build goes down the drain . It 's a point . So , how can you help ? Thanks for coming , terry . When eddie marquez calls , you listen . He was my rabbi . He saved my ass more than once . You 've been running the wire on the spoors . From the get-go . We 're working the alex spoor homicide . We think the feds have been holding back . You want me to turn over discs from a confidential investigation ? You 're familiar with " malfeasance , " terry ? Say a murder was committed and you had proof as to who was involved , but you withhold it . Any idea what you 'd be looking at ? So she 's the bad cop ? She 'll kick your ass out your mouth . Look , you have to understand , this whole thing was classified . I mean , lawson said it was being handled at the highest levels . Did you guys flip alex ? Not exactly . The day he was killed , we picked up a phone conversation . The two parties agreed to a meet in chinatown . So we followed them and recorded it shotgun . We need to know what you 've got . If it takes a year in the courts , we 'll take that year , trust me . For you , it 'll be a very bad year . Save it , guys . You 're kicking an open door . I 'm still nypd . I 'll get you those tapes . Nicholas ! I told you I 'd keep my word . What have you got ? With two days to spare . Live from chinatown . Tape : what are you doing ? Why are we here ? At first , I thought this was you , nicholas , but the voice is too light . It 's alex . Tape : I always looked out for you . This one 's you . I trusted you . And you go to the feds . Alex : I didn 't go to the feds . Turn it off . Now . I don 't think so . I said turn it off . Tape : I know , alex . You 're trying to sell me out . You killed piers , nicholas . Don 't talk to me about selling out . Piers betrayed us . To the chens . So you murdered him ? Yes , I talked to the feds , and I 'd talk to them again . You got to be stopped , nick . Piers was our brother . Not anymore . And neither are you . No ! No ! No , please ! I got it wrong , nick . It wasn 't alex who was on the feds ' payroll , it was you . For years , you 've been giving them stuff . Wearing a wire . That 's how you found out alex had talked to them . They were feeding you . You can 't touch me . We 're not the feds . I think we can . Kill them . Do it . You don 't have a family anymore , nick . Nicholas spoor was the most important source we have had in this division 's in the last 20 years . Do you know how many convictions he brought us ? He also killed his brothers . What do you think we deal with out there ? They 're all killers . Alex spoor wasn 't . Now , answer me this ... How did nicholas know alex had approached the feds ? How ? It 's all about protecting the golden goose . You are way out of line here . Special agent derek lawson . What a happy coincidence . I 've just gotten off the phone with your sac . Apparently , you failed to disclose some vital information about your investigation . Why are you talking to my superiors ? I woke up feeling like today was a good day to violate the chain of command . Or did they call me ? Huh . Well , whichever . They 've turned it over to opr , who are starting their own investigation . Of you . Amsterdam . You concern me . Can this wait ? You 're a lone ranger . That never ends well . Look at lawson . That is truly annoying . Tell me about it . Mr. Spoor . / . I never got a chance uo tell you how sorry I was about alex . Dying so young . He got robbed . I wanted to ask you about your father . Rosie ? He was a good man . A teacher . Like alex . Family split up when rosie was 17 . Kid changed his name . Never saw his dad again . Rosie became a teacher ? But then how did the family get into- - The depression , I made some choices . Made a lot of money with those choices . My children and my children 's children paid the price . You got kids ? Here and there . I hope you do better by them ... Than I did . Wasn 't sure i 'd see you again . I hate to leave things unfinished . About what you said in the hospital . Forget the past . Yours in particular . Just answer me the following questions ... Are you currently married ? no . Gay ? No , I take that back . Witness protection ? no . Terminal ? Not sure . Do you want to spend some time together ? Yes . Very much . My turn . Hungry ? Ravenous . I know a little place in chinatown . Very dark . Very romantic . After , there 's a little gallery in the village . I didn 't know you liked art . I used to paint a little . You ever hear of the armory show ? no . Well . I wasn 't in it .

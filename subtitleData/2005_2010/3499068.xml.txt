 Previously on Kings ... Some ministry positions have recently opened , and I 'm offering one to someone in name only . I think you two will enjoy working together . He came in a few hours ago . Count 's bad and fever climbing . Why do I ever leave ? I 'm happy when I 'm here . What is it ? The cost . The bloody King of Carmel , Vesper Abedon . I 'm the only one who ever tells you the truth . God gave us this land ! Not even Silas can take it away . - What 's gonna happen to my brother ? - He committed treason . He saved Michelle . Which is why he lives ... to stand trial . Don 't talk to me anymore . Don 't talk to any of us . Looks like someone 's ready for Judgment day . Quite a crowd gathered today at unity hall . Of the thousands of cases submitted , the committee has chosen just ten . All wait to hear the final decision . Judgment day . Bigger crowd every year . Everyone wants an old-school lord and master . Cutting a few babies in half . Your healthcare suit ... don 't get your hopes up . Just a warning . You work for the ministry of information . No good word for your sister ? Katrina Ghent isn 't interested in good words . She found the case dreary . Right . Since when do you let anyone else 's opinion win out ? Since I started listening to him . Whereas ... we made law where there was none , we mined justice from sand ... Whereas we have courts , civil and criminal , presided over by a tribunal of judges who all apply good law with study , intelligence , and compassion . In the case of State versus Ethan Shepherd , we have reviewed all evidence and are prepared to impart our decision . Will the defense please come ? A system of appeals insures justice decreed is justice deserved . And today ... the last recourse for those of you who feel themselves denied fair address of grievance ... ten cases here selected . I alone will adjudicate , divine wisdom my only counsel . And my gavel sound only after my words correct what is not right . Whereas ... Chancellor . First case . Watson versus Colfair . Second case , Milton versus the city of Arcadia . Ethan Shepherd , you know the severity of the charges . Your please stands ? It does . Not guilty , your honor . Then , for the record , the charges against you ... The congregation of the Silent Prayer versus Reverend Ephram Samuels . Margolis versus Hopewell . Seven sisters Brothel versus Carter . One count of fomenting dissent by means of physical violence . On two counts of reckless disregard for human life . One count of unlawful use of a firearm . And the tenth and final case ... The township of Sela versus Nayar . And the final charge ... One count of high treason against the crown of Gilboa . And on all charges we find the defendant , Ethan Shepherd , guilty . We will reconvene in 48 hours for sentencing . Tonight , we celebrate , and tomorrow at eight bells , Judgment day begins . - We have sacrificed too much already . - I 'll make a please to the King . - I swear I 'll do anything I have to . - I don 't need you . God will save me . I 'll fix this . Don 't worry . I will fix this ! Winston . Thank you . - Make do with your egg whites . - Eggs without yolks . Sacrilege . Prometheus on the rock gave better breakfast . I can 't get through to your father . - I 'll do anything . - Judgment day . - Everyone waits on his schedule . - My brother can 't wait . He 's being sentenced tomorrow . Look , I know Ethan let you be taken hostage . It may not put him in your favor , but I have to ask . I 'll do what I can . Believe me . I have to . - You can 't let this stand . - I don 't intend to . I 'm gonna sneak a couple of these in my pocket . David 's brother has been found guilty . - And rightly so . - David will suffer for this . You have to weigh in . - It 's Judgment day . - Why 's David even a subject ? His family harbored a traitor . He should be exiled . Sir , five till . A full boardroom waits . I 'm due at the ministry . I 'll walk with you . I need to clear my mind . Am I denied all pleasures this morning ? You 've had plenty . - Try a spelt muffin . - I 'd rather starve . Shepherd 's brother . We 'll find something . Hate Judgment day . More mess every year . I like it . Each envelope contains a unit of hope . More envelopes ... more hope . More envelopes , more hopes denied . - Some of us hold on to hope . - Boyden , Klotz . Wider path , please . The King approaches . You 're never gonna tell her you love her . - I will . - When ? Tomorrow . End of Judgment day . Let 's judge . The court calls Watson versus Colfair . Gentlemen . - A matter of pig . - Hog , Sir . My stud hog services were appropriated without payment or consent . Your hog wandered onto my land . What was given , given naturally . How 'd I rule in the last case involving livestock ? Found for the cow , Sir . I feel the crux of this case can be made clear by its only witness . Chancellor ... Let me see the pig ... Hog . A case dropped out of Judgment day . We 'll need an alternate . Call my sister , offer her an audience . Perhaps I was too quick denying her . Generous and polite . I 'm lucky to have you for a boss . You have no idea . Just do as I say when I say , and we 'll both have our due . Is cook prepared for table tonight ? With a mind to the King 's satisfaction . Broiled salmon , tomatoes , capers , wine . - Cook swears the cream won 't be missed . - I applaud cook 's optimism . At last , on dessert . Andrew is allergic to eggs . Andrew ? - Cross ? I thought he was ... - In exile . He was . Back tonight . And my nephew will be welcome to table by all . Hello dad . Andrew . I didn 't hear you come in . Why didn 't you tell me you came ? Didn 't wanna bother you . Welcome home , son . Every man 's entitled to pride of country and his livelihood . Medallion restored as well as full ownership of said cab . Your own boss now , Sir . - Drive carefully . - Thank you . Chancellor , You keep your King waiting on pork . At last word , approaching city limits . Move it forward . I 'm of a mind to judge . - David Shepherd did request a moment . - Yes , the right time . Captain David Shepherd ! - Sir ... - I submit to you ... Captain David Shepherd , a hero well-known . But unknown is his bravery in the crisis at port Prosperity . I know your brother . But I cannot publicly overturn a court 's ruling on treason . - Sir , I beg for clemency . - Not even for your sake . But I will hear none speak ill of you for his . The medal of valor . Our highest order offered . Given four times ever . Now five . His brother 's convicted of treason and Shepherd gets a medal . Where do we stand with the new tenth case ? Your sister 's set to present as we speak . I 'm due in chambers . Go . And keep Michelle talking . That 's cruel ... my father thinking a strip of tin will make up for your brother . - He can 't show favor . - He 's King . He can have cats called dogs if he wanted . But he doesn 't want to help you because he can 't intercede in a lower court decision without looking weak . But if the case were presented before him ... Call for Judgment day , for example ... How could that help ? That 's the whole reason for today . The kinder he is , the more they love him . If you can get your brother in there , my father can show the mercy he feels . But it ... it 's too late . I mean , the case is already chosen . The ministers are in session , deliberating . Your new tenth case ... Right now . Why should this come in as a tenth case ? We already have a system of healthcare . The system is anemic . Insurance companies refusing to fund treatment at the expense of patients ' lives . Coverage must be compelled . There wasn 't supposed to be competition for the opening . She was the only other one who knew , but ... I assume she knew about your brother . ... the girl 's genetic predisposition . Any other country in the developed world ... - I thought you wanted to help me . - I do . You took my chance to present . Look ... I 'm at your mercy . For my brother 's sake , I 'll ask . Withdraw your case so he can have a clear path . You can either help me or not . David and your sister at odds . Enough tarnishing for one day ? What 's the point of having power if you don 't use it ? The congregation of the Silent prayer versus Reverend Ephram Samuels . Presenting for the congregation is accountant Jane Lewellyn . Reverend samuels embezzled a half a million of our congregation funds , lost to unwise investment . His signature ... authorizing the transaction . I signed no such thing . It 's a forgery . You 're the one person in the country no one thinks capable of stealing a cent . Sterling reputation in the balance . I don 't expect a dose of shame . This is your signature exactly You withdrew our case ? After all that work to get heard , what , David Shepherd waltzes in and you shelve your ideals ? It was the right thing to do . Right or not , we 've been called to chambers . You don 't remember signing this . The day in question says here you ... signed off on moving choir practice to saturday nights . It was Wednesday nights . You signed the investment contract without reading it . A busy man has no time for fine print . Well , I hope you 're not too stubborn to admit to human error . I may have signed ... without knowledge . Miss Lewellyn . It was you who drafted the contract for the Reverend , lost the funds yourself , now looking to ... place blame ? I hereby order you to stand trial for theft and misrepresentation . We have read and weighed . The tenth position is awarded to ... miss Michelle Benjamin . Benjamin versus royal crown of gilboa to be brought before the King tomorrow by close of day 's business . But I withdrew ... We invested time and effort into the review . Unless there 's a change , your case holds the most merit . The ministers need a reason , I 'll give them one . I 'll get Ethan to recant . Turns out someone 's been leaning hard on the prosecution to make an example . They 're pushing for the death penalty . I thought you should know . - Are you pleased with my ruling ? - Just and generous . Address was given without expectation or barter . Is there something else that you wanted ? Why don 't you come to table this evening ? Too long since we 've shared a meal . We haven 't been on terms to break bread . I find myself in need of company . - Your coat , Sir ? - No , thank you . The mansion never changes . Aunt Rose will be happy to see you . I remember aunt Rose . I know all will go well tonight , Andrew . Welcome ... the absent son of Shiloh . Welcome ! Andrew returned home , overdue . - Come , sit , sit , sit . - Please . Reverend samuels ... is late . He sent his regrets . I thought you knew . He seems content , william . Yes . I was thinking , perhaps a position ... Something in unity hall . We 'll let him settle in . This time , things will be different , I trust ? Don 't feel bad , uncle . You did what you had to . Exile wasn 't so unpleasant . It was just ... empty . Nothing but time . No one to talk to . Like you know how many nice things there are in life , and they 're all denied you . You know ? Fish . I know . It 's always something lost . This time a shoe . Don 't ask me how . Well done , by the way , suffering through fish while we enjoyed roast . No snacking . - Why did we pardon Andrew ? - Do you even listen to me when I speak ? Not when I get a better offer . Don 't say a word . Don 't move an ... inch . Haven 't you had your fill ? Never . You 're really quite something , you know . After all these years ? Perhaps deserving of a medal ? - You really don 't like that boy . - I like our own boy . - You should too . - Enough of all that . Why don 't we just go to bed and pretend that we have neither kids nor kingdoms to consider ? You have an early morning of judgment . Well , I 'm not in the mood to judge . Justice is indifferent to your moods . As is my own wife , apparently . After all I 've done ... - To recant now ? - King can 't forgive you if you don 't . I don 't want his forgiveness . I want him to change his mind . He won 't on the land , but he might on you . If you give him a reason . Don 't you understand ? I stood up to the King for what I believe . Why would I want to live a life that 's saved by a lie ? As much as you believe in Silas , I know that he 's wrong . I know that he 's not the one in God 's heart . I don 't even know if there is a God . But I know that we can change things . You and I ... We 're the ones here ! We 're the ones who can save you . Can 't you see , David ? I 'm already saved . What 's this ? I 'm hungry . You need to help David . His brother won 't recant . - You know how badly this could go . - I tried . Who do you think suggested he present his case in the first place ? He won 't have a chance unless you convince Katrina to vote his way . I know you , Jack . You don 't let other people tell you what to do . You give the orders . I 'm just a humble civil servant . You 're lying . You 're calling the shots at information . You choreographed David 's entire situation ! You 'd let his brother die for jealousy ? - What , one too many magazine covers ... - I 'm not jealous ! He can have all the magazine covers he wants ! Then why ... ruin him ? Risk someone dying ... To save myself ! Don 't you get it ? I 'm fighting for my right to exist ! Whose life is more secure than yours ? You 're the prince ! And you 're the princess . Born first by four minutes . Eldest by a hair . Are you really that innocent that you haven 't thought about it yourself ? Or are you just too ashamed to admit you have ? No one wants your crown . Not yet . You can produce an heir . So what ? You could still take pride of place . I see the way you look at Shepherd . I see the way your father looks at him . All it takes is one wedding , and he can make of the pair of you a King and queen . And me ... Suddenly the court jester . I will not sit by and be plowed into obscurity by someone else 's ambition . Not after all I sacrificed . What do you want me to do ... Swear to never see David again ? All you have to do is tell Shepherd to take what 's offered . Landlady let me in . Benefits of being a princess . I 've a message from Katrina Ghent , a way to save your brother . Katrina carries influence with the judges on your brother 's case . She 's willing to wield it to lighten his sentence . What could she possibly want from me ? Your next press briefing . She wants you to denounce my father , say that he 's wrong on port Prosperity , tell the world that he 's lost his way , and ... he 's not fit to lead us . Why would she want that ? She knows it would hurt him , coming from you . So this is how it really works . If Ethan won 't save himself , you have to . To save my brother ... I 'm supposed to go against my King . If I make that choice ... I 'll never see you again . I 'm sorry . I can 't . Tender . You finished with that ? Is this my last meal , then , before execution ? Goodness ! It 's not my birthday , is it ? By my count , I 've over a week . Four months ago . I don 't need occasion to extend courtesy to a prisoner . Oh , dear . The King is bored . I felt that gloom ... I 'd rape a serving girl . So sure of yourself . I got nothing to do . I think a lot about you . There 's clarity in solitude . You don 't think I see loneliness when it 's eating in front of me ? You 're a king ... and every second you aren 't miserable is a second stolen . It 's a long time since you 've been a king . Our lives ... Not much different . Though ... I somehow make do without self-pity . Watch yourself . You expect to rule the world and be happy ? Being a King 's a terrible job . Joyless . No comfort or heat . No silky lover who wants nothing back . You 'd sure find ... The ark as a true friend . God won 't allow it . You still try , and he mocks you for it . What did I ever do to God ? You asked to be king . Macaroon ? Next case . The township of Sela versus Nayar . Dr. Nayar has turned himself in for a drunk driving hit and run fatality committed ten years ago . Authorities are looking to press full charges . I have struggled with the guilt of my mistakes since I was a young man . I 've spent the past ten years working as a doctor . I know ... the lives I 've saved can never take the place of the one I took . I believe that my time would be better spent in the community . We have a character witness in support of the defense , Helen Pardes . I am here on account of my son , Seth . Dr. Nayar has saved his life countless times , and his kindness and caring are second only to the boy 's father , whose visits have been less frequent of late . He works . Is your son well at the present time ? Yes , thanks to his doctor . And the hope of better days . You 're asking me to forgive ... A fatal crime to soothe one boy . Dr. Nayar has provided my son with a presence of stability , safety , of strength . A strength my son needs to stay alive . You are acting as God today , Sir . I ask you ... how much more can God demand ? I 'm sure Dr. Nayar deserves gratitude . As much as it will cause pain , I must do what God and law require . I order the doctor to be returned to prison to serve full sentence for wrongful death as applicable by law . Next case . I 'm not supposed to use this as a place to talk about personal things . But I find I have to . This is the first time ... I 've experienced how justice really works . Live . Not on TV . I see now ... how lucky we are to have a King who knows the difference between what is right and what is expedient . Who understands the sacrifices that must be made in order to pursue the true course ... so that we ... So that I ... can learn from him . Call the judge . David 's brother gets the full penalty . You tell him that 's from me . I tried . I can 't . Manipulating the system , dirty justice ... I can 't speak against him . I don 't want this . I don 't deserve it . They 're sentencing Ethan . I should be with him . They 're ready for us in the boardroom . And I have a feeling this could be it for us . No good reason . Just a feeling . I don 't think I can . You should present . After everything you 've done to get this here ? David Shepherd . When you wanted to withdraw his case , you said it was the moral choice . It was . You did it for him . Is that it then , you 're in love with him ? Don 't deny it on my account . I 'm not scared of a little competion . I 'll see you inside . Andrew ? I 'm home . Hello ? The court will rise . Ethan Shepherd , You have been found guilty of the high crime of treason against the crown . This court accordingly sentences you ... to death . Sentence to be carried out on the gallows dawn tomorrow . Granted . Your healthcare bill turned court case now made law . After so many petions for the same , is this the extent of jubilation ? Other things weigh on the mind . Indeed . Ladies and gentlemen , this is the conclusion of judgment day . You 're missing the festivities . His brother will die in the morning , thanks to you . Thanks to us . David didn 't do it . Why ? Because he actually believes in my father . Even without him denouncing the King , and with his brother 's head on the chop , he won 't stay . Either way ... I 'm rid of him . Only at the cost of tar on your soul . Don 't you worry about my immortal soul . It 's been starved . Maybe you wanna feed it ... or lecture me sternly somewhere private . You , of all people , Judging me ? That can 't feel good when someone like me won 't even have you . End of Judgment Day . Finally get to clean up . End of judgment day . You didn 't tell her . I know . - You 're never goingto tell her . - I know . You have business here , take it up with my son . I only came to return something the King might be looking for . I came here ... greedy for all the trappings position could provide . Someone here had all that ... and ... turned it down . Your friend . On to bed , Sir ? Time to assume . Not on rounds ? It 's the end of my shift , Sir . Long day after watching you . Doesn 't have to be over . It 's good to know I have someone I can trust . Captain Shepherd . You came when called . Under these circumstances . I failed my family . Not much to be done at home . Nothing more required . Your brother is being moved . Moved ? To a minimum security facility in vital will he will serve in full a six-month sentence if he can learn from his newfound remorse and keep his mouth shut . You did this ? Not for favor . I 'm justice . Impartial . Not blind . But when a court 's sentence is at such an extreme , It validates the sovereign 's right of oversight . You 'll be ... wanting to tell the family , plan a visit ? I wasn 't sure about God ... or how he deals with any of this . Now I see . God works through you . I love you too , mom . I 'll see you tonight . I can 't wait . Come on in . Good news about your brother . I 'm sorry there wasn 't more that I could do and ... It 's fine . I know you tried . I owe you something . The truth . About us . You and I , we keep finding ourselves in these ... moments ... where we look at each other and ... we both know what 's supposed to come next . And then I run . I didn 't know you thought the same . I did . I do . The same . I felt ridiculous for even thinking ... You 're not ridiculous . You 're in my heart . But I can 't ... David . Not ever . I don 't understand . - If you want to ... - I 'm sorry . I swore ... I 'm promised to someone else . I 'm sorry .

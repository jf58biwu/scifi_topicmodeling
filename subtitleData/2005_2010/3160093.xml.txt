Which is why maybe this isn 't the best thing for zack right now . Well , it would just be part-time . I mean I could still take him and pick him up from schoolevery day , most days . Ah , I don 't know . Dan , we have to start thinking long-term .

Those guys were committed . You ever seen them before ? No.Neighborhood 's really gone downhill . Probably just a couple of junkies looking for some cash .

Backstreet brothers , ' n sync or something.Why , what 's up ? You heard anything about a shooting earlier today ? Victim 's name is joel nemec . I 'm gonna take a wild guess : You 're working the valencia street gang case . - What can you tell me ? - It 's in trial right now . Ya know , a trip to the courthouse wouldn 't kill you.I thought reporters did research . What do you think I 'm doing ? Fine , but I really should start getting commission on your stories . Check 's in the mail . Uh , they 're saying the shooting was an attempt to stop nemec from testifying . - Against the gang ? - Yeah . They 've been running drugs in the mission . Nemec owns a furniture import business on their turf . They bullied him into shipping in heroin from overseas for them . - And he flipped on them ? - He 's the key witness in the case .

Okay , it 's a 1974 series . - It 'S ... old . - Right . No , no , no , I mean it 's , uh ... it 's actually strange for a bill this old to be in such mint condition . - Where , where 'd you get it ? - Does it look legit ? Uh , well , let 's see . It 's hard to say . It 's either been out of circulation for three decades or it 's counterfeit . I 'd have to check the inks to be sure . Do it.And run the serial number against the criminal database ; - see if you get a hit . - What , you think it 's stolen ? You tell me , marty . - hello ? - Katie ? Ed macklin . Ed.Hi ! How are you doing ? Wow , it 's been ... way , way too long.I 'd love to catch up , but I only have a minute . Listen , did you apply for a position at channel 6 ?

Thank you , thank you.Listen , if you 're still interested , why don 't we grab some lunch tomorrow , and try to figure something out ? Seriously ? Wow . That ... um , geez , I real ... I really appreciate you thinking of me . Well , why do I hear a " but " in there ? yeah.I just , uh ... it 's just I haven 't had a chance to talk to dan about going back to work yet . Don 't worry.I got plenty of dirt on old danny from the old days , - and blackmail is not beneath me . - Interesting.Care to share ? Only if I need to . Listen , take the night . - We 'll talk more tomorrow ? - Yeah . - Yeah , that sounds good . - Good . Thanks a lot , ed.I 'll see you then . Hey , it 's dan.Leave me a message . Must have been some party . Whoa.You okay ? - I don 't know . - What happened ? I rescued a guy from a couple of gangbangers . Now I seem to be paying for it . - Who did you save ? - Guy named joel nemec . He 's testifying tomorrow against a gang running drugs in the mission . Nemec wouldn 't be testifying if I hadn 't saved his life . That was hours ago.I 'm still here in ' 99 . - Shouldn 't I be going home ? - Normally , yeah . They found my nametagwhen they ambushed the car . That 's how they figured out where I live . They probably figured joel was talking to the press . Which means they think that I know everything . Liv , they tracked me here , my address in ' 99 . You 're not here to protect joel anymore . You 're here to protect you . It 's going to take forever . Complaining won 't make it go any faster . When are you supposed to be home anyway ? I don 't know . That 's kind of the problem . Okay , that should be enough . Maybe if i tried to warn myself , said people were after me . Well , who exactly is going to talk to your old self ? I 've been dead almost a year here . - Well , I could call on the phone . - No . We can 't risk altering your past in any way . The whole ripple effect in your timeline ... can 't believe we 're having this discussion . I can.I have them all the time with my wife now , never with my dead fiancée , though . No offense ? None taken . - I think it 's dry . - okay . Damn . - What ? - I loved this table . You have no idea how hardit was to find this thing . - I 'm kind of surprised it broke . - How come ? Always seemed pretty sturdy to me . so ... if something happenedto my past self , that would change everything , right ? Katie , me.Zack. None of it would have ever happened . Well , lucky for you , I got out of your life when I did , huh ? - That 's not what I meant . - Don 't worry.We 'll fix it . - All right . - This way . Here ? Is that it ? Okay.Don 't make any sudden moves . okay , one mess down , one to ... hey , whoa , whoa.No , no , that 's supposed to go there . everything in its place . Then let 's get out of here . Oh , never again . You know , I 'm putting it in my contract . Listen , if the worst part of your job is to cover a stupid renn faire , consider yourself lucky . Anyway , I thoughtit was kind of fun.Yeah , you would . What 's to hate ? Come on . Uh , grown men in tights , iambic pentameter , pipers , this ... okay , have you seen this costume ? No wonder jack dumped you with a wardrobe like that . Okay , it 's a loaner.And let 's not revise history.I dumped him . Yeah , whatever.Listen , I 'm exhausted.You want to come in for a bit ? If you 're too tired , you know ... - I could have a beer . - Great . I have really got to stop coming here . it only took you seven months to get over me ? Uh , katie and i weren 't dating yet.We just hung out a lot . In fact , I thought she kind of liked eddie . You 're just .. inspector vasser ? Richard garrity.I 'm with the bureau . Oh , pleasure.What can I do for you , agent garrity ? You submitted an inquiry on this currency yesterday ? Yeah , I did.Is there a problem ? Our system flagged it . Serial number on the bill was a match to a federal case from ' 75 . You familiar with a dylan mccleen ? Yeoh , ah.The guy that , uh , hijacked a plane and then parachuted off with a hundred grand . That 's him.Some of these bills turn up every couple of years . It 's standard protocol to follow up . Wait a sec.You saying that money came from the dylanmccleen heist ? Sometimes this job surprises me . How exactly did you come into this bill ? I got that off a tip from a confidential informant . I 'm afraid I can 't say much more than that without jeopardizingan ongoing investigation . You understand , any details you provide will be treated with full discretion . Of course.I ... I tell you what . I 'll check into a few leads , and I 'll see what I can dig up . I 'd appreciate it . - Great . - All right . Hey , that guy 's leaving with your wife . How comeI never met ed ? He worked with katie at the station . - You think they ever ... ? - What ? No.well , I don 't think so . So ... do I , uh , really need to ask ? What ? Where 'd the car come from ? Borrowed it . All right , I don 't want to know.I got enough problems . Actually , I 've been thinking . You said joel 's supposed to testify in the morning , right ? Yeah . So , once he takes the stand , you 're in the clear . - The damage will be done . - I don 't know.Gangs tend to hold grudges . But most of the time , in cases like these , - a dominant motive is to eliminate the witnesses . - What do you know ? You worked at the da 's office , what , a year ? One more year than you . well , it 's midnight . We can camp out here , keep our eye on the building , make sure they don 't come back . At least you 're already in for the night . Not exactly . I thought he said he was exhausted . He says a lot of things . Incoming . - Any idea where you just went ? - Yeah . Boscoe 's donut palace.During the day . At night , the owner runs illicit poker games . I remember your so-called late nights at the office . That was nothing.After you were gone from my life , it really got bad . You okay ? Yeah.vu moment . Something about this night just came back to me . It looks like we 're not the only ones who followed me here . - We could ram ' em . - They have guns . What if we figure out a way to keep my past self in there longer , so he doesn 't come out ? That would change the natural order of things . We can 't just sit here ; it 's been over an hour , and those guys aren 't going anywhere . I know , but we can 't do anything that will mess with your past . Well , how 's it gonna mess with my past when I come out after six scotches and ask those guys for a ride ? I 'm going to call the police . And get yourself arrested for gambling ? It beats dying . - Hello ? - Wait , dan.Dan ! This is bad . Wait , wait , wait.What ... - what are you going to do ? - I don 't know.Something. Hey ! Vasser , stop ! I don 't have any money.Stay down and shut up ! how 's it feel ? - I 'm trying to help you . - Do I know you ? get in ! Go ! Go ! So how 's danny doing these days anyway ? He 's good.Things have been a little hectic lately . You and me both . so I got to ask . - Are you and danny okay for cash ? - Sure.Why ? I mean , you getting back in the game and all ... - forget it ; I don 't want to pry . - Uh-huh.Since when ? danny 's not back at the tables , is he ? Oh , god , no , no , it 's nothing like that . I 'm sure you heard about the layoffs . We 're just looking to cover our bases . - He still with the register ? - Thankfully . Print business is taking a real hit these days . All the more reason to come to television news , right ? Well , the internet 's going to take us both down . Maybe . it 's been a tough month , though . I lost a reporter to channel 12 , I got another out on maternity leave . I just need somebody to cover a couple shifts a week . Well , I think I can do that as long as you promise not to put me on the morning show . Oh , what , you got something against getting up at 3 : 00 A.M. ? - Yeah , a seven-year-old . - Oh , that 's right.I forgot . Okay , if I promise no morning shows , do we have a deal ? I guess we do . Well , then , welcome back to the exciting world of broadcast journalism . Give it up.Give it up . almost there . Dollar margarita night . - he locked it . - Keys . - Got ' em . - You think he saw you back there ? 'Cause this could get pretty messy . I doubt it ; it was dark . And judging by his breath , he 's wasted . Yeah . and the details of that night were pretty fuzzy the next day . this wasn 't exactly my best year . I don 't know if I ever said it , but I want you to know - I 'm sorry . - For what ? For leaving . For not telling you the truth . It wasn 't easy for me either . Yeah . After the plane crash , when they didn 't find your body , I kept thinking , maybe ... maybe you didn 't get on that plane . Every time the phone rang , every time someone came to the door ... I guess the hard part was the not knowing . Not getting a chance to say good-bye to you . Well , it turns out " good-bye " was unnecessary . You know , a couple of times tonight when we were talking ... - it was like nothing had ever changed . - Yeah , yeah . Except those guys trying to kill me . And you fighting yourself ... that 's new . Maybe you won 't remember any of this tomorrow and everything will be the same . Livia , there 's something I need to tell you . something important happened after that poker game . - I thought you didn 't remember . - I didn 'T . - Someone filled me in the next day . - Great . I came here to get the rest of my money . - You went back to the game ? - Yeah , I had a pretty bad night . I almost lost everything except ... katie came toget me.She ... pulled me out . - How did she know you were at the game ? - Don 't know . All I remember is waking up here the next morning and there she was , sat right next to me . She 'd stayed the whole night through just to make sure I was okay . That was the moment we both ... kind of knew . Oh . I need to get to that game . If I 'm not there when katie comes for me ... you don 't end up together . No katie , no family , no son . He 's not going anywhere tonight . You could go back to that game , pose as yourself . I just need to get my money . I don 't understand.It should be here . - Where else would you have put it ? - Nowhere.It 's got ... - he took it . - Who ? The guy who trashed my apartment ... he stole my money . - vasser . - Yeah . Oh , damn , wrong one . - What are you doing here ? - How you doing , hugh ? Oh , same old . Not going to lie to you , though . I 'm never really comfortable when there 's a police officer in my newsroom unsupervised . Oh , relax , I 'm just looking for my brother . I 've been trying to reach him all day . - Join the club . - You having trouble finding him , too ? - No more than usual . - Why ? There a problem ? No , he 's just been working long hours lately . Dan pretty much works his own hours . He 's meeting his deadlines ? Missed maybe twoin ten years . How many in the last month ? Just have him give me a call when he gets in . Sure thing . How much money are we talking here ? I had over 20 grand in that drawer , give or take a few . You never heard of a bank ? It wasn 't exactly tax-deductible . - Anything ? - $ 242.07 . That 's all my past self has to his name . - Is that going to be enough ? - Not even close . Well , wait.We just need enough to get you in the game , right ? High stakes.I can 't even sit at the table without ten grand , minimum . Where are we going to get that kind of money at 1 : 00 in the morning ? Oh , great , perfect . Dan 's old cd Zack 's Winter clothes Zack 's Winter clothes will , hey , it 's dan , yeah . I 'm sorry to bother you.I know it 's late . It 's kind of an emergency . We 're not talking crazy money or anything . Ten grand.Hello ? Hey , hey , alex , it 's dan . That 's bull.When have I ... ? You know that I 'll pay you back . When have I ever not paid you back ? You know I 'm good for it . Okay , yeah.You know what ? Forget it . It 's chump change.You know that I 'll pay you back within the week . Never mind.I think I just figured out how I 'm going to get this money . yeah . When are they moving him ? I 'm on my way . why am I here ? Think , livia , think . Hey.Early day today ? We need to talk.Where 's dan ? I don 't know.Probably at work.Why ? He 's not at work ; I was just there . Is everything okay ? I know what 's in the closet.I saw the money . What money ? Just tell me where it came from . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Jack , where are you going ? Jack . Jack . Jack , talk to me . Jack.Please stop . Where is it ? Does dan have it ? - Okay , can you just stop for a second ? - No.Where 's my brother ? I really wish I knew . Okay , I am tired of playing this game with you . - I want you to answer the damn question . - Jack , you 're tired ? ! You come barging in here every day with some new accusation , you go digging through our finances , our private affairs ... for good reason.I 'm protecting you from yourselves . - You can 't police our lives . - Wake up , katie ! There were thousands of dollars of stolen money in here . You could go to jail.Dan could go to jail . Your son could go to a foster home . Now , I want to know where that money is now . You know what ? I 'm done . From the beginning , some of the most acute concerns about y2k difficulties involved air travel , which , after all , is heavily reliant on computers . It 's one thing to stock up on bottled water and canned food , but if something goes wrong ... there aren 't a lotof home remedies . Sick or visiting ? Are you sick , or are you visiting someone ? - Just visiting . - Me , too . My husband ate an expired can of sardines . - I 'm sorry . - It 's ridiculous . They put the expiration date on top of the can . Once you peel it back , you can 't even read it anymore . You don 't think it 's mercury poisoning , do you ? 'Cause this-this whole toxic dumping thing has me up at night . Gun ! - what happened ? - Kind of a long story . We got a problem.I was back at the game by now . - How did you get that ? - It was in your house . - You went to my house ? - Yes.We have to go . - You okay ? - Yeah . I saw katie . She didn 't see me . What else did you see ? I saw your house . Your life , zack . He 's adorable , by the way . That must have been hard . You deserve to be happy . - got to go . - I know Any idea what you 're supposed to do in there ? lose a lot of money and hope that katie shows up somehow . Well , good luck.Or bad luck . Hey , look who 's back ! I thought you were done for the night . Well , guess I just feel lucky . In for a thousand . 2,000 . 5.000 why don 't you take a load off ? I 'll put some coffeeon . Yeah , I just ... - I got to do something first . - What ? Got to puke . damn it ! dan ? long night . You could say that . Liv ... you saved my life . Thank you . I guess everything 's the way it 's supposed to be . Yeah . Good-bye , dan . We 'll have a high of 59 degrees with a temperature ... is this a bad time ? I was in the neighborhood . - Of course not.Have a seat . - Thanks . Any progress with that currency ? I hit a few walls , but I 'M ... I 'm still following up on a couple of leads . Anything promising ? It 's hard to say . I 'm sure you know ... tracing stolen cash these days is more art than science . Well , if you 'd like to share your findings , I 'd be happy to take some of the load off your shoulders . Thanks.I 'd rather not.It 's kind of a sensitive matter . - I want all your case files . - Excuse me ? Let 's cut the crap . I don 't know why , but you 're withholding information in a federal investigation . That 's a hell of an accusation . You 're damn right it is . So , you either tell me exactly where you found the bill , or I can start making things very difficult for you . All right . You want to know where I got the bill ? I got it from my brother .

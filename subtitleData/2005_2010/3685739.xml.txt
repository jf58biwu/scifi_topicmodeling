 My name is Jane Vasco . I could use you on my team . I work for a secret government agency that hunts Neuros . People who can do dangerous things with their minds . On my first assignement something a little weird happen , Okay , something really weird Until I get some answers , I 'm getting on with my life , doing my job , stocking up on aspirin , Because , I got to tell ya , pain 's a bitch . This is beautiful . You like it ? Absolutely beautiful . She 's just talking about the tag , Riley ! I know ! I love salamanders ! It 's not a salamader , it 's a chameleon . It 's the underground cop of the reptile world . Always blends in . Can 't be pinned down . It 's perfect for you So what 's gonna be for you , Lady ? Maybe a puma . Cunning , dangerous , Ever quite know , it 's going on beyond nice Hey , I ain 't got nothing for a while , thanks Hey , come on . It would be great right in here , ya Right there . Yeah , but who ? Ah no , I don 't know , I 'll pass , Thanks . Truly a shame . Now , you 're telling me All right , so what do you think I should get ? Right here All around here Definitely not that hangover you 're gonna have tomorrow morning buddy We should heu ... pack 'in up ! No it 's early , it 's early , right ? Seing , it 's early ! No , actually Mo , it 's quite late . Why don 't you , heu , paid him ? Do you accept good " two it is " ? Never said no before ! I think our friends has had a little bit too much to drink I dare say that yes ! Okay ! Jane , that man is an artist . And you 're clearly a patron of the arts . So , whatta you say ? The three of us ? My place ? One of us has to take him home . You girls could flip for it . That was easy . C 'mon ri , get in the taxi . You coming ? No , i 've got a ride . Oh , right . C 'mon cinderella . We better get home , before i turn into a pumpkin . I think you passed that critical line . So your place or mine ? Ri , you are really going to feel terrible in the morning . Five more , Five more minutes . Dr. Pearson to maternity , please Dr. Pearson to maternity . { / i } What ? No ! Hello ? Hello ? Is anybody here ? ! Hospitals , not exactly one of the top ten vacation destinations . Sterile surroundings , intimidating machines . And lab coated doctors rattling off critical data ... They make indigestion sound like some flesh ravaging disease . Then there 's the worst part ... The food . But the question of the day isn 't what 's on the menu , but what the hell was I doing here ? Hey , you 're awake . Who are you ? What happened ? Where am i ? How did i get here ? I 'm shelly . I 'm your day nurse . You 're in the hospital . Why am i tied down ? The doctor will be in , in a minute . Why can 't you tell me what the hell 's going on . I 'm sorry . The doctor .. No , no , please . You 'll pul your lines out . Take it easy , just try and keep still . Okay , okay ... It 's for your own safety , jane . I 'll take over , thank you . I 'm sorry about the restraints . But last night ... What about last night ? You don 't remember anything about last night ? Of course i do . I was out with my friends . I took riley home then i went home . At least i thought i did . That 's all you remember ? Well , clearly there 's something i can 't rember . So why don 't you tell me what 's happening to me . I 'm your doctor . Jakob baumgartner . As for your memory loss ... Don 't be too concerned . A certain amount of memory loss is to be expected . To be expected from what ? ! Was in some kind of accident ? Some of the treatments you 've received have been .. Rigorous . Treatments ? How long have i been in here ? Why don 't we have this conversation after the effects of the sedatives have worn off . Why don 't we have it now ? Because i 'd prefer that you were clear and focused . And less agitated . We 'll bring you some breakfast . Some strong coffee . We 'll talk afterwards . Why can 't you tell me what 's happening to me ? Do this for me . Have some breakfast and some faith that i have the best interest at heart . I promise , all your questions will be answered . I 'll be back soon . How 's our patient vasco ? Pretty much what we expected . Disoriented . Angry . Confused . You reassured her , of course . Gained her trust . Yes . But as i told you from the outset , vasco isn 't a simple case . Dr. Baumgartner . I was wondering about your orders for patient vasco . No more restraints ? No , not at present . Any special orders for staff , then ? Do we need to be on suicide watch ? No , i don 't expect that to be a problem . Thank you . Okay . No sudden movements , that 's how you pull these things off . Sorry . The doctor said he 'd be back to speak with me . That was over an hour ago . I 'll let him know . Soon , please . Seth ? Dr. Carpenter . Were we expecting you ? I 'm concerned about jane vasco . Of course you are . That 's to be expected . How is she doing ? She hasn 't recovered from her coma yet , Dr. Baumgartner is encouraged though . Her vitals are strong . If i could just look in on her . There 's really no point right now . I 'm sorry you wasted a trip . If there 's any change , I assure you , we 'll let you know . Seth ! Seth ! Seth ! Seth ! Jane ! I don 't know why they 're lying to you or what 's going on but we 've got to get out of here . Seth , we 've got to go , now ! Security ! Guards ! What are you doing ? This is no way to behave , jane . What are you talking about ? Why are you doing this to me ? What did you expect , jane ? How should we treat you after you killed riley ? What ? ! Get off of me ! It is impossible ! I don 't believe it . That 's not going to bring jensen back . It doesn 't make any sense ? Why would i do that ? When was this supposed to have happened ? Is this another thing you claim not to remember ? Andre ... I honestly don 't rember . You want to play this game , jensen had too much to drink . You walked to his place . He was found dead the next morning . Why don 't you tell me what happened ! What set you off ? ! How am I supposed to tell you what happened , when i don 't even believe this ! You don 't believe it ? Really ? You believe that ? Is that yours ? Looks like it is . Does that jog your memory ? Riley , you 're really going to feel terrible . It doesn 't make any sense . I made a bad call with you , vasco . I should 've turned you in . What are you talking about ? Your healing powers , jane . What did you think that was all about ? Your dna has tested neuro positive . Why didn 't you tell me ? Would it have changed anything ? The question is , why didn 't i report it to my superiors , if i had jensen might be alive today . In that sense , i own this as much as you do . And this place ? What is it ? If I am what you say I am , why not just chip me and take me to the lab at the internment center ? Where the others go . Chip you ? With your abilities ? As for the internment centre , we 'd get no answers there . Nico has been a complete failure . And this place ? Baumgartner ? Baumgartner was head of research at nico . Fought an uphill battle for two years to change procedures . But we still sent neuros there . No alternative . Not until baumgartner quit . Nico 's no more than a warehouse . They 've cut funding to almost nothing . The place is a toilet . The only one who seemed to care was baumgartner about research about finding answers . And maybe a cure . that 's beautiful . You think he can help me ? Help you . Do you think i give a damn if he could help you . As far as i 'm concerned , you 're here to help him . An intact neuro . Unchipped , powers fully functioning . There 's a lot he can learn from you . Things i should have but didn 't . I 'll be taking marrow samples along each leg . I 'll need ten intraosseus 1.27 mm needles . Did you say ten ? In a single session ? I should up the dosage of tetracaine or else she 'll feel pain ? You won 't need an anesthetic . For bone marrow extrusion ? Protocol calls for a 5 mig minimum , doctor . Anything less and she 'll be screaming in agony . We 're setting new standards , nurse wells . I don 't understand . I don 't need you to understand . I need you to assist . First needle please . - If you need something you should tell me now . - I don 't need anything ... That 's all , nurse , you can wait outside please . Okay , jane , just relax . I don 't give a damn about what happens . As far as i 'm concerned you are here to help him . Hey , how are you doing ? I 'm still alive . So not doing so good . Well ... Dr. Baumgartner seems quite sure of his methods . Even if they seem a little unconventional . I 'm just going to sterilize the entry sites , it 'll only sting a little . I must 've misunderstood . There 're no points of entry . Didn 't they ... ? Didn 't they tell you ? I 'm different . Is there anything i can get for you ? Are you in pain ? What 's it going to be for you , lady , maye a puma ... What i need , you can 't get for me . We have a visitor . I 'll send her in . Hey , kiddo . How you doing ? Mo , did i really do those things ? Did i really kill riley ? I loved riley . I don 't know what 's happening to me . You 'll be okay . I don 't even know who i am anymore . What did andre say to you ? He told me what happened and what i have to do . Follow doctor 's orders . Baumgartner . Let me ask you something . What 's your take on that guy ? What do you mean ? I don 't know . It 's just this whole thing . Why ? Before you , before any of this happen , did you ever hear any discussion that nico was failing ? Andre probably thought it was none of our business . Maybe . Or maybe he has something to hide . It 's a chameleon , always blends in . You ? The fact that he has someone like you on our team . You mean a neuro . That 's not been confirmed . Apparently you missed the morning edition . Mo , what 're you getting at ? I don 't know . It 's more questions than answers . It 's just ... I don 't know , baumgartner . Keeping you away from the internment center could be andre 's way of covering his ass . That doesn 't sound like andre . No , but killing riley doesn 't sound like you . I want to look into this , if i find any answers ... Trust me . I want to be the first to know . So hang in there , okay . I 'll be back . Nurse wells , bring me the bone marrow results for patient vasco . Perhaps i left it in my office . I found them , dr . Baumgartner . Good . I 'll be in room c examining the results . Seth ... You shouldn 't be out of your room without permission . I just needed to take a walk . To think . I understand . Next time , though , ask for permission . This is a hospital , not a prison . It 's for your own safety , jane . What happened , seth ? What would make me hurt riley ? I don 't know . There 's still a lot we don 't know about ... Neuros ? Your condition . And you think this is the best place for me ? Maybe the only place . But why not nico ? I thought all the research was centered there ? I thought andre told you . Nico 's become an embarrassment . They 've given up trying to do anything but store the people we send them . That 's why baumgartner left . Exactly . Jakob baumgartner is the foremost expert in this field . He authored the first paper describing the neuro aberration . He 's done nothing since but study the phenomenon . He resigned from nico when he saw their changed priorities . Do you trust him ? I do . Sorry , jane . I 'll look back on you tomorrow . Connor , am i glad to see you ! You got to know what 's going on here . Shhh , it 's okay . Don 't do this . Listen to me ! Why would i listen to anything a damn neuro has to say ? Are you part of this , too ? Face it , lady , you had us all fooled for a while , but you 're just another chip candidate . And what 're you , connor ? You and seth ? All of you . You just march step to whatever Andre tells you to do ? Mcbride didn 't kill riley . You did . So yeah. right now , i 'd follow him into hell . And being here with you ... It looks like i 'm already there . How is she ? She feels cut off and abandoned . Alone and isolated . She found the nico report as we expected she would . Then we 're almost there . Yes . I prefer speaking with you face to face . Any word on vasco ? Is that concern i hear ? So i like the broad . I just want to find her so I can bust her chops . I 'm sure she 'll be flattered . Riley ? Tell me you got something ! Look , I got feelers running into every system in the known universe . Airports , hospitals , everything 's running a blank . No credit card use , no atm hits . Nothing . You two , i need a complete timeline of everything you did that night . Every bar you stopped at , every joker who offered you a drink . Boss ... What ? We 've been over this ten times . We 'll go through it 10,000 times until we find her , is that clear ? ! I want security footage from every red light camera , bank lobby , every wired parking ramp you might have passed on thursday night . You think we had a stalker ? It happens . Wrong kind of guy sees a couple of chicks out drinking , faculties impaired maybe ... Follows his favourite one home , for the snatch and grab . How " impaired " was jane ? A few beers . Tequila . A few tequilas . Connor , emergency rooms in person . Every jane doe , every female admitted in the last two days . Done . Wait a minute ! If she 'd been hurt , she would have healed out by now . Theoretically , yes . But we have to check all possibilities . If she 's hurt and not healing , we can figure out why later . After we find her . Connor .. You should check the morgues , too . I think we 're ready to move to the final phase . She 's convinced that i 'm a fraud and that her only hope lies in getting to nico . Jakob , you understand failure is not an option . You were quite clear about that . It 's crucial that i find the location of that center . And she 's the only one who can take me to it . All that 's left is to throw her a lifeline , which is ? The one person she really trusts . This is good . Good evening . Good evening , doctor . I 'm afraid i was right about andre . I found out some things . That makes two of us . I found a report . The nico report . I managed to tap into riley 's database . I found the same thing . Then you know that baumgartner 's full of crap . I should be at nico . The doctors there are onto something . That 's why i 'm here . If andre finds out ... The hell with Andre . We 've got to get you out of here , jane . Thanks , mo . I owe you . You do . And you 'll pay . Just lay low , i got to figure things out . I 'll be back in the morning . And we 'll get you to nico . I 'd like to check on the state credentials of a dr . Jakob baumgartner ? Yeah ok , I 'll hold .. Hi , tomorrow ... Can i call back in the morning then ? Perfect . Thank you very much . Jane . - Here you are ! - What are you doing here ? They told me they moved you tonight ... I have to talk to you . What is it ? Whatever 's going on here ... Baumgartner ... He 's not a ... He 's a .. He 's a ... - What ? - He 's a ... I don 't know what he is . I 'm not even know if he 's human . But this hospital , this whole place ... What they 're doing to you ... It 's all a lie ! Okay , jane , it 's a lie . What do you mean ? There are no patients here , none . And no other doctors . Whatever 's going on ... It 's all about you . I know . I don 't understand . I saw something earlier . I don 't know how to explain it . But the doctor ... Somehow he changed ... I know it sounds insane but he 's some kind of monster who can change his appearance . I don 't know what he is . That 's okay .. That 's okay We 're called neuros , shelly . How are you feeling ? Little bit woozy , must have given me something . If we 're going to do this , we 're doing it now . Let 's go . What are you doing out of your room ? Get down ! Everybody stay down ! Everybody stay down ! No one will get hurt ! Stay down ! Put it down ! Put it down ! Damn it jane , my gun 's jammed ! No ! Mo ! My ankle ! Where 's the car ? Go ! Go ! Go ! Hurry ! I am ! Are you okay , mo ? ! Yeah , i 'm okay . Brought your clothes to change into . Aren 't you relieved you 'll be at nico soon ? ! You always had my best mo , i appreciate it . Hey Mo , you know what ? I heu ... I officially forgive you for stealing todd engels right out from under me the first year at the academy . Hey , what did you expect . He was there . I wasn 't really into him anyway . Thanks for driving , my ankle still killing me . Don 't talk to me about your ankle , i 'm the one who got shot in the back . let 's get out of here . Fill it up , we don 't want to stop again . We 're attracting too much attention . Hand me my wallet out of my purse and i 'll pay you when we get going . Have you got cash ? I don 't want anybody tracking us by my cards . Good thinking . Thanks . Jane 's credit card ! $ 23.47 for gas . How soon before we get to nico , jane ? We won 't get there until tomorrow . You planning to drive all night ? I could use a break . How 's the ankle ? Not good , actually . Want to stop and take a rest ? I just want to get there . How 'd you girls like your food ? It was fine . Best hash browns in the state . Great . I get you anything else ? No , i think we 're gonna head out . Just the check . Do you have enough cash ? Meet you in the car . Your foot better ? You want to drive ? It 's a little sore but if you 're sick of it , I can try . It 's fine , i 'll do it . Thanks Thank you ! Bless your hearts ! No problem . What can i say , i 'm a good tipper . Another hit . $ 23.47 again . $ 23.47 ... $ 23.47 ... How 's the ankle ? Still a little swollen . Hope you don 't mind driving the rest of the way to nico . No , we 're almost there . Excellent . This is it . This is it ? This is nico ? Why ? I just expected ... Don 't you recognize it ? This is where you live . No , that 's not exactly right . This is where i live . You forgot one small detail , doc . Maureen just got a new tattoo . And you didn 't realize i saw you walking without a limp . As my father always says ... What you don 't know can hurt you . Are you okay ? I will be . What ? I never thought i 'd be so happy to see the real you . Where 's riley ? He 's back at the command centre . Connor ... Want to get this garbage in the car , please . You got my messages . Guess i did . I don 't think we ever had a shape-shifter before . The guy did a pretty good " you . " never as good as the real thing . Really ? You took a hell of a risk , vasco , even if you didn 't believe maureen . How did you know the rest of us weren 't real . To be honest , i had my doubts about you , too . I mean baumgartner 's version of you . He kept referring to riley as jensen . You never do that . Smart . So once i figured out maureen wasn 't maureen , the rest fell into place , besides you would never had been caught with someone like todd engels . Who ? Exactly . Mo , i officially forgive you for stealing todd engels . What do you expect , he was there . Rember that little dude from first year at the academy ? Oh , the dorky guy who was always quoting mark twain ? No . I figured wherever you guys were , you 'd be looking for me . And i knew that if anyone could find me .. It would have to be " the best . " I brought donuts . Sweet ! Riley ! They told me i killed you . I could think of worse ways to go . I got it right away . $ 23.47 for gas . $ 23.47 for breakfast . I told him i was using cash but i knew you 'd pick up those hits on my credit card . Of course . Hey , it was big tip . Everyone knows you 're not that big a tipper . Good thing you remembered my address . Good information . Don 't even think about it . So what was it about ? Did baumgartner give anything up ? Not a thing . Obviously he wanted the location of nico . He has it now . Hope you had a good vacation , vasco . But we 've got work to do . Vacation ? Yep , I 'm home ! We often take our friends for granted until something happens and makes us appreciate them more than ever . Like being there for us when we break up with our boyfriends . Or when we realize they don 't want to be dissected in medical experiments and locked up for killing one of them . Absolutely nothing . Not a scrap of paper . It 's like no one was ever here . According to riley , there 's no record of any recent tenants . I can try to track something down through utilities or moving services , but I 'm not holding out much hope . This was a pro job . Whoever did this has skills and money Give me a minute . When i was in this room , i thought my friends had turned on me . I thought i deserved it . I was never happier to find out it wasn 't true . To be honest ... There 's a part of me stil waiting for it to happen . Ready ? Yeah . There 's nothing here . They 've accepted me as part of their team , even with my gift . But i 'm still not sure that gift isn 't really a curse , and it 's just a matter of time before they realize it . Okay , i have trust issues , sue me .

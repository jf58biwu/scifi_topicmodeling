 Previously on warehouse 13 ... Claudia Donovan , Warehouse 13 : Next generation . Don 't you want to be ? With people your own age ? Artie , I 'm at my own age . This place is my home . Macpherson 's headed east on st . Catherine ! I want what you risked your lives to get . I can get Macpherson again . I don 't doubt it . You came after family . Arthur started it . What is that supposed to mean ? Ask him . 15 YEARS AGO Don 't quote warehouse dogma to me , Arthur ! A woman 's life is at stake . Many people 's lives are at stake ! And you made an oath . - I love her . I will save her . You love her . I know that you love her too . Then you know how agonizing this is for me . You can save her life ! What about the consequences ? She lives , other people die ! You want that on your head ? You can 't play god ! Well , neither can you . Neither you nor physics nor the regents . They sit in there , Arthur , and they hoard the things that can save the world . We help them . Well , not anymore . I 'm finished with it . Now , give me that ! No . No ! I can 't . Arthur ... Arthur . Five firemen died that night . Only the woman survived . Who was she ? Carol Augustine . She lives in D. C. Now , alone , as far as we know . And she was Macpherson 's wife ? Yes . Did they ever nail the murdering son of a - Macpherson was given five consecutive life sentences and banished from the warehouse . So obviously Macpherson escaped . After serving two years in confinement , there was an unexplained explosion in the prison . Dozens were killed . We were told that Macpherson was among them . We were misinformed . Then he shows up at the Japanese embassy in D. C. We 've had carol under surveillance ever since . I 've been monitoring the D. C. Operation , and he hasn 't made any contact . No , he went after my family instead . I can understand why Artie 's obsessed with him . Well , this guy has no trouble killing anybody , does he ? As you go after him , you 'd do well to remember that . Come on So how do you banish somebody from the warehouse anyway ? It 's sounds very Romeo Juliet . No , no , no , there 's nothing romantic about it . The walls of this warehouse are infused with this very rare mineral called painite . And before Macpherson was incarcerated , he was permanently injected with a substance that reacts violently when in proximity of this painite . Violently ? Could you be a tad more specific with your modifiers ? I could . If Macpherson ran through this warehouse , then his blood would turn acidic and immediately eat through his own veins . Dude ... indeed . Where are you , by the way ? Already through the middle east , heading into north Africa-I 'll find him . Yeah ? - It 's what I does . Well , you may have met your match when it comes to hacking through what Macpherson - oh , yes . Who da best ? You got a nibble ? A chomp . - What ? Edgar Allen Poe 's pen . For sale . No . Let me see . Excuse me . " To view the rest of this elite collection ... " collection ? Why would he be selling artifacts if-don 't don 't click that ! Um , I always run a virus scan before I enter an unknown site . That 's a good idea . - So yeah ... oh , no . No , no , no , no , no . You do not shut down the claudiometer . I 'm terribly , terribly sorry . Life in the cyber world , bro . Gonna need a sec . You know , you could try - touch it and die . WASHINGTON , DC Thank you for waiting , sir . Mr. Freitag , I feel that this may be of particular interest to you . What , exactly , does this do , Mr. Macpherson ? Run your fingers along the rim . Oh , god ! Consider it a gift . A taste of things to come . Mr. Macpherson , what other artifacts will be for sale ? Mr. Pak , already greedy for more I see . Well , I am in the process of collecting others as we speak . But in the meantime , behold the phoenix . This is the reason why we are here in my factory-this demonstration ? Very perceptive , Mr. Freitag . Yes , I didn 't think that cautious gentlemen , such as yourselves , would want to spend this kind of money on hearsay or legend . You would be correct . Carson , would you just hold this for a moment ? Thank you . What are you doing , man ? Wait ! Stop ! He 'll die in there . Patient ! Patience . Yes . There . As you see , in the right hands , this can be uniquely useful . What is it ? What 's wrong with them ? Cause and effect , gentlemen . - Cause and effect . Even anomalies are bound by their own laws of nature . Insignificant collateral damage . But appropriate for a demonstration . Mr. Macpherson , make it stop . It cannot be stopped . For every life the phoenix saves , others will be lost . Those who touch the phoenix , they will be spared . But others are less fortunate . You dare to do this in my factory ? A demonstration , Mr. Freitag . If you haven 't the stomach for it , perhaps the phoenix is not for you . Gentlemen ... can you imagine this tool in the hands of one of your patriots ? The commitment of a suicide bomber who never , ever dies . I managed to crash the computer system , so I 'm sorry , till we 're up and running , deaf , dumb , and blind . Don 't worry , I 'll get us back online . A girl loves a challenge . Oh , that 's just great . The fate of the warehouse in the hands of a 16-year-old kid . Perfect . - Okay , 19.19 And the same kid who found you and hacked into supersecretville once already . Okay ? A little faith , please . Why is he selling the pen ? I mean , god knows what else he 's got . What is he up to ? Okay , let 's go over what we don 't know . That could take weeks . Months . - Years . Look , Artie , you must have forgotten something . You know Macpherson better than anybody . There must be some small detail that you 've overlooked . Yeah , something insignificant . A contact he might have used . A favorite place . A relative . Just ... you two are what , interrogating me ? They 're investigating . That 's why we hired them . Is it not ? Um , so about carol . How do you know about carol ? What did-what-you told them ? Everything ? No , of course you did . Of course you did . No wonder I 'm getting the third degree . You think you might have asked me before you just blurt it out ? Agent Nielsen ! You 're forgetting yourself . Arthur , no one knows what he 's capable of better than you . Except , possibly , me . Bering and agent lattimer will need to know everything if they 're to survive this . Everything . Yeah . Sorry . You 're right . It 's just that I never should have gone to see Caroline the first place . When Macpherson went to D. C ... and the years have just twisted his thinking . I just didn 't know if I was putting her life in danger . The three of you need to speak to her . No . No , no , no . I 've already put enough of a spotlight on that woman . You 've got no choice , Arthur . She 's our only lead . Dude Don 't sweat it . I 'll cover it from here . After being magnetized to the ceiling and nearly ground up in the gooery , I think I 'm prepped . What ? Why are you shaking your jowls at me ? You should all get going . I 'll stay with Claudia , and she will brief me on those two events . No matter what he said , you 're not safe . I haven 't seen James Macpherson in 15 years . I never even visited him in prison . Well , that 's hard to believe since he saved your life . Others died that night in my place . I wouldn 't have made that choice . And I have never forgiven James for making it for me . Artie knows that . You like fresh-cut flowers . I beg your pardon . - They 're all around the apartment . Well , as you said , I like them . There 's a jewelry box in the trash with some wrapping paper . I had a birthday . - Your birthday ' sin four months . We 're very good at the Google . There 's two umbrellas behind me . One 's pink , one 's black . Was it raining three days ago ? - I think it was . He 's not the man you think he is . he 's changed . - Carol ... carol ... Listen to me . I would like to protect you from whatever the hell it is he 's planning to do . God , you know , you come barging in here disrupting my life . He 's only been here few times . When was the last ? Three days ago . Oh , well , it 's easy to understand how you would have forgotten that . What 's this ? I have no idea . - Let me see that . This is an Egyptian symbol . It 's a was scepter . It represents power . The deities used to carry this around as a sign of their control over the forces of chaos . It 's funny ... it 's the same as the pendant you 're wearing around your neck . Oh , let me see that . That 's very nice . It 's from James ? - Yes . You know I have to ask you for it , carol . Amazing . You think working in some magical storage unit gives you the right to do as you please ? Stop protecting him . I never could decide , does Mrs. Frederic hire arrogant people , or do you just get arrogant by working there ? What is it ? - I got a really bad feeling . About what ? Well , I think it 's about ... Artie . I think-I think he 's gonna - never mind . It 's gone now . 6166 Broadview . Ironically , the warehouse district . We are up and running . Taking her to warp speed , captain . Okay , do you think you can hack into Macpherson 's site ? Well , yeah , duh . But major fire-wall age . I mean , you get past one , and there 's another one set up right at - Claudia . Claudia , what 's wrong ? Who 's that ? That 's him . That-that 's James Macpherson ? Claudia ... leena ... I know him . How ? He was Joshua 's physics professor . I mean , I was just a kid , but I remember that face . He was the one who gave joshua rheticus 's compass . He contacted me . What ? When ? Eight months ago . I was tracking Artie , trying to find this place , and I hit a snag . And out of the blue I hear from professor Reynolds , right . He " friends " me . We email back and forth . " How 's Joshua ? " Blah blah blah . I fill him in , tell him about my project , and he suggests a few ways around the firewall . The warehouse firewall ? Leena , I think James Macpherson helped me hack into the warehouse . Tool and die factory ? Why tool and die . What is he doing ? I don 't know , maybe he 's got a new career . He doesn 't exactly strike me as the blue-collar type . All right , this is-this is a German machine , I think . I think they all are . Why would he go to the trouble - can I help you ? We 're not open to the public . We 're looking for James Macpherson . There 's no one here by that name . Do you know him ? Who are you ? Secret service . We 're gonna need to look around . Yes , well , by all means make yourself at home . What are you doing ? Close your eyes . Okay . All right . Just close your eyes . There . You can hear me ? Oh ! Yeah . - Yes ? All right . Okay ? - Okay . Artie , what was that ? That was the goblet of Severan . A goblet of Severan because , obviously , the goblet 's in the warehouse , so there must have been another one that survived . Well , I bet I can guess what it does . Pete , put this glass in your pocket . This-this-this was designed by a roman glass blower in 221 for the emperor Elagabalus , who was a ridiculously incompetent young man . The only way he could get a room quiet was by using this thing . It emitted a high-pitched sound and brought everyone to their knees . I could 've used one of those in high school . Indeed . All right , so just , um-Artie , this has that egyptian symbol on it . The was scepter . - Yes . Maybe carol 's ... like ... this . And now it ... opens . Always interesting . Hold this . The phoenix . - What ? It 's the phoenix . - Wait , wait . Let me see , let me see . I look great in glasses . Oh , my-that is amazing ! What ? What is that ? " Starting bid $ 20 million " ? It says that ? - Yeah , it 's like a catalog . But the phoenix is in the warehouse . He 's selling it ? 20 million , and that 's just the starter . No , he can 't have it . It 's in the warehouse . That doesn 't make any sense . Why would he sell it ? I mean , he 's not doing this for the money . Yeah , what kind of a villain would he be ? Listen to me . The phoenix is in the warehouse . He doesn 't have it . Well-but even if he did have it , right , he 's not doing this for the money . No , he 's not doing it for the money . He 's doing it for another reason . I just don 't know what . Here , check it . This is too easy . He wants us to find these things . Exactly , which is what 's making me very , very nervous about following this lead . And making me very nervous ... about dragging the two of you with me . Don 't even worry about that . - No , no , no . All right , fine . Yes , obviously it 's a trap of some sort . But he would know that I know it 's a trap . So what is he planning , knowing that I know he knows ? Guys , this-this has the date , time , and address of the auction , and ... it 's today . The auction is today . Is she certain ? She claims that Macpherson was posing as Joshua 's professor . That 's how he made his initial contact . She 's very upset . Where is she now ? At the B.N.B. Your bodyguard 's keeping an eye on her . What is it ? I 've just always felt that she was out of tune . Something hovering . I just could never tell what , exactly . This is troubling . Do you think that he could still be using her somehow ? Yes . Macpherson claims to have the phoenix . The phoenix is in the warehouse . I know . I 'll get back to you . Now I 'm getting angry . When I told him the phoenix was gone , he was genuinely surprised and distraught . Then he told me about the goblet of Severan . Well , here it is . Safe and sound . Open it , please . Okay . That 's not possible . He can 't possibly have access to warehouse things unless - yes . These new video displays record access , do they not ? Hang on . There 's my access , which was a few moments ago . Let me just toggle back to see the last person ... Macpherson certainly knowhow to pick his spots . This is Frederic . - Go ahead , I 'll catch up . I feel like Custer walking into little big horn . If he wanted us dead , he 's had several opportunities . This-this is about something else . All right , well , what ? This is the place . This is the time . There 's nothing here . Hey , guys , the phoenix and the goblet of Severan ... Mrs. Frederic says it 's been taken from the warehouse . And she seemed shaken . Mrs. Frederic ? - Yeah . Seemed shaken ? - Yeah . That is so not comforting . Oh , great , great . So what do we do now ? Just wait for Macpherson to drop a net on us ? If he 's ahead of us and we can 't see him , then we 're gonna have to follow the trail he leaves until we can see him . And we watch each other 's backs . What ? - Good afternoon . - Nothing . Nothing . Do you see that ? Did-did the boy cause this ? Artie , Artie , you still got those glasses ? Good idea . You know ... oh , I thought I knew what these were-this is-but they 're not the originals . He replicated timothy leary 's reading glasses , but why ? Check these out . The guy who gave us Isd ? Dr. Leary experimented with a lot of different ways to see beyond what our brains are capable of seeing . Okay , can I see those , please ? You know , the originals , when you put them on , you never want to take ' em off . Tell me about it . - Artie ? - Yeah . Um , that wooden box . Can I see that ? Thank you . Fancy ! James always did have a flair for the dramatic . - Ladies first . - What ? Uh , yeah , age before beauty . What ? He 's older than me . He 's older than both of us put together . All right , shut up . Hold that . Children . I 'm working with children . Okay ... hand that to me . - Be careful . - Here Okay , don 't tilt it . I 've got my lunch in there . Okay . These are warehouse 13 crates there . Okay , it 's-it 's really bad again . - What is ? Your vibe ? - Yeah . About ... ? Yes . Well , when did you get it again ? As soon as we walked in here . It just kicked me in the gut . Are you sure ? Yeah , that 's why I 'm telling you . Yeah , but you can 't tell him unless you 're positive . Okay , stop , stop . What are you talking about ? What vibe ? About me ? - Yeah . - What about me ? Look , I don 't know . Artie , man , I hate this . - Just tell me exactly what you 're feeling . - It 's nothing . I mean , I don 't know yet . Look , Artie , all I know is I got a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach . Well , when you get a really specific feeling , just let me know , will you ? You 'll be the first . Okay , look , down here ... see ? - Yeah . - I 'm gonna go down there alone . Yes . And I want you guys to go back around that way . - I think it meets up around the other side . - No , no , no , no ! Artie ! Artie ! Artie ! No ! We shouldn 't split up . Look , if he really is planning an ambush , don 't you think it 's best that we 're not all caught up in it ? He does have a point . He has a point . Artie ! Keep your Tesla handy . I 'm fine . Go . I don 't want to tell you anything more about it because I 'd prefer not to have any competition with anybody . It 's all true . I 've seen it with my own eyes . A man rose from the ashes to survive the blast of a furnace . And seeing truly is believing . Wouldn 't you say ? Gentlemen , thank you all so much for joining me here today . Mr. Pak , how are your ears ? A little better ? How 's your vibe now ? - Not good . - It 's nice to see you . As Mr. Freitag has told you all ... - what 's he doing ? - I don 't know . The price of this particular item at 20 million , U. S. Currency . Okay , possibilities . Um , Artie knocked Macpherson out and is pretending to take his place . Yeah , but they knew him . They called him " Mr. Nielsen . " No , Macpherson has some kind of mind control over Artie . Well , it 's a strange way to use it . - Well ... - okay , Pete ... what if Artie 's trading in30 years at the warehouse for $ 20 million ? Or ... oh , snap ! Artie is Macpherson . Uh , no . Oh come on , you don 't actually believe that , do you ? Hold it right there , buddy ? Yeah , yeah , stay-stay there until we figure this out . Cut it out , you two . That 's not me . I 'm me . I 'll make an exception . How are we supposed to know that ? Look . Security cameras . So ? He 's setting me up . He tried to do it a few weeks ago with honjo masamune . You don 't remember ? He went after the sword plus he dug up my past . I was arrested for treason ! This time he 's gonna make sure it sticks . That must be why Mrs. Frederic sounded so strange . Oh , so what , did he go out and get an Artie suit ? Huh ? How do we know that you 're not him pretending to be you ? The thimble . You really did read the whole manual , didn 't you ? I did . What-what thimble ? Harriet Tubman 's thimble . She wore it as she stitched the rags of her fellow slaves . It became imbued with her dream of a better life . And it developed properties of light refraction , so that people saw an image different from the image of the person wearing the thimble . It came in very handy for the underground railroad during the civil war . All right , well , let 's just go in and blast him . No , no , no , no , no , no . No , he 's expecting that . Well , what 's he not expecting ? This-I didn 't-no . No . There 's no way . Claudia . Claudia ! Leena ... Mrs. Frederic , this place is my home . I would never do anything to hurt any of you , least of all Artie . We know you wouldn 't . Not on purpose . What does that mean ? Do you think he put some kind of bug in my brain or something ? There are any number of methods to create sleeper agents . Apparently Macpherson has amassed quite a collection of warehouse artifacts . Then torture me . You people do that . You 've gotta have some kind of truth serum laying around here somewhere . Pump me full of it . Read me ! Read my colors . Tell my fortune . Whatever it is you do , you can tell , right ? Yes , I can . And I have . Claudia , I 'm sorry , but something is wrong . Oh , my god . I 'm like the freakin Manchurian candidate or something . What the hell ! Let her go . For the time being it 's best if she weren 't in the warehouse . - What if she disappears ? - She 's being watched . I 've never seen her this upset before . That 's what made James such an excellent agent . He 'd get inside your head , throw you off your game . Just when you thought you had the upper hand , he 'd strike . 48 million going once ... twice ... sold to Mr. Pak . And when I get confirmation that the money is in our account , then the phoenix will be yours . Wrong again , Arthur . Remember these ? Gentlemen , this next items something that we went to a great deal of trouble to acquire . Edgar Allen Poe 's notebook , and his pen . Together they give their owner the unique ability to make what they write actually happen . - What is that ? - It 's a fire alarm . - We must get out of here . - There 's no need to panic . Mr. Nielsen , I 'd rather not be here when the authorities arrive . Excellent point . Next time , Mr. Nielsen . Gentlemen ... federal agents ! Don 't bother ! I 'm sorry you went to all that trouble getting Poe 's pen . I guess you wasted your time attacking my family . Okay , pal , time for you to finally get yours . Just don 't kill him . He 's an excellent bodyguard . I 'd hate to lose him . Wha-who the hell - James Macpherson , you 're under arrest . Aren 't you adorable ? You didn 't really think it was gonna be that easy , did you ? Do you remember our old friend Erik ? He made those wonderful implosion grenades , which I demonstrated for you a few weeks ago . Before his untimely death , I had him bring back yet another old favorite-the eggshell bomb . This time with a pinch of promethium . If the slightest pressure cracks the shell , it results in a small nuclear reaction . Small but dazzling . Carson . Now , you two drop those little toys of yours or Arthur will lose his footing . Thank you . Jaw getting tired , Arthur ? It won 't be long now . You were a warehouse agent . What the hell happened to you ? 15 years of exile . And now I want to give Arthur back the gift he gave me . But unfortunately , you 're going to be tried for your crimes ... posthumously . You think ? In your soul , you believe as I do . That 's the vibe you 've been feeling . How do you know what I 'm feeling ? Because I know you , Peter Lattimer , better than you know yourself . I was you . Shall I tell you the thought that crosses your mind occasionally ? What if these artifacts really do belong out in the world , instead of being locked up by a gang of autocratic regents who see the universe through the blinders of their own bureaucracy ? Walk out of here with me now ... and follow what you know to be true in your soul . That 's a nice speech . It sounds even better with the fancy accent . - But it still doesn 't cover the fact that - you are out of your gourd , McNutty-pants ! You put a bomb in a man 's mouth . Not really a great recruiting tool . Fair enough . Well , I 'll be saying good-bye , then . You expect us to just let you walk out of here ? No , no , I expect you to die while you 're trying to save Arthur . And I 'd say he 's got about ... 30 seconds . Hey , Mac . Good catch . So we 're never turning him into the government ? The government ? I don 't think so . He 's already proven that prisons can 't hold him . So then , what happens to him ? I mean , we 're not going to , you know ... no , no , no , no . Although he would happily kill all of us without blinking an eye . No , we don 't operate like that . We 'll put him in the bronze sector . Arthur , I 'm honored . Okay , I promise to read the manual this weekend , but what-what is the bronze sector ? Actually , I don 't remember that being in the manual . The bronze sector , children , is where the most dangerous people in history have been , um ... what 's the generous phrase ? Preserved . Yes , preserved . People whose removal from society had to be certain . They 're put in the bronze sector . Locked for all eternity in warehouse 13 ? How poetic . Even a twisted mind can be an artifact . Let 's go . Aren 't you forgetting something ? Uh , not that I can think of . My blood . If I remember correctly , my veins will burst upon entry . I say we give it a try , see what happens . James ... what a bittersweet reunion . You 've aged . Mrs. Frederic , you haven 't . You must tell me your secret . Perhaps on a warm summer day over tea . Perhaps not . All this time you 've had them . How simple . I wish I 'd thought of it . What are those ? Crystalline diamonds with a trace of palladium . Palladium ? It neutralizes the minerals in his blood . So he doesn 't go kablooey . Unfortunately . That is a load off my mind . Good-bye , James . Yeah . Let 's go . So why is the bronze sector not in the manual ? No , no , no , it 's far too dangerous for there to be a written record . If someone were to find this place , somehow reverse the process-the point is we don 't want these people out in the world . So this place is filled with , like , the worst guys ever , right ? Hitler , Mussolini , Michael Vick . No , no , these are men and women who would have become hitlers and Mussolini 's or worse , except ... we got to them first . A room filled with evil that you 've never heard of . Seems so unfair . No , this is a process that was first explored in ... Mesopotamia . - In 1230 b - uh , 50 . 1250 B. C. Anyway , the bronzing process was too heavy , and it kind of cracked open-let 's just say it was unsuccessful . Here , what we do is we flash-freeze the bodies cryogenically , and we preserve them by bronzing . Unfortunately ... it 's a painless process . Really ? How many times have you tried it ? It 's about as painful as a sword in the chest . Touché . What a beautiful creature . A farewell gift , Arthur ? You shouldn 't have . Just ignore the monster in the cage . Pete and Myka , the stolen artifacts have been loaded in . Can I get your help replacing them ? Fine by me . I 'd rather not see this . Oh , wait , come on . I want to watch this . When 's the next time something like this is gonna happen ? Hopefully never . Who says you can never go home again , eh , Arthur ? James . You know , I thought I 'd have a lot more to say to you . Good-bye , James . Arthur ... we can still be partners . Pleading for your life ? That 's out of character for you . I 'm not pleading for my life . I 'm pleading for yours . You know , maybe I should go check on Artie . I 'm sure he 's fine . You know what , I 'll go check . I 'll be back in a second . What a waste . Gonna go downtown with my baby ' cause she looks so - Turn around . My dear , thank you for remembering our appointment . Oh , that is a relief ! Wave to Arthur so he can enjoy the tape later . We 're clear . You won 't be needing that anymore . So was it all worth it ? Unfettered access to warehouse 13 ? Time will tell . There 's work to be done . The codes I implanted when Arthur tried to access my site need to be activated . Go on . Tempus fugit . Late , as usual . How did you-get away from there ! Or what ? You 've had your chance , Arthur ! So many chances ! Go ahead , fire it ! You see , there 's a way around almost anything ... partner ! No ! Artie . Artie ! Artie ! Can you hear me ? Artie ! Get up ! Artie . Artie ! Artie ! Get up ! Pete , hurry ! Look out . James , wait ! sync. gioni666

He couldt t have . I just found out . Whatever . I 'm my way . I am so sorry . She 's not usually like this . I mean , she 's usually a pretty considerate person . I guess she just takes her job responsibilities really seriously . Try not toakake it personally , because it 's not about you . I mean , you 're nice , and I think she really likes you .

What do you want to tell me ? You 're not safe here . You need to get on that plane and go home . I mean , come on , it 's a horse race . It 's not worth dying over . How much time have you spent in imara ? That would be none . I 'm not afraid to die for my beliefs and my people . I thought I might see you here . You 're on this case ? No , they just called me in for backup . Hey , where 's your protective gear ? Oh , tom , don 't start . This isn 't me thinking you can 't handle yourself . This is me thinking about a sniper bullet that big which almost blew out your brains . This is so typical of berkut . They think that the rules don 't apply to them . - The cia always goes by the book ? - You mind ? Yeah , actually , I do . You 're talking to my partner , causing yet another distraction , so back off . Tom , I 'll call you later , okay ? Well , why don 't you tell your partner that you don 't show up to a mission like this with no protection . She doesn 't even have a weapon ! You are way in over your head , Let 's go . We 've got work to do . I told you cia boy was a bad idea . I don 't need relationship advice from you , antonio . I spy with my little eye ... what is it , sommers ? What 's that ? I don 't know . A piece of rubber ? I 'm not sure if I should trust you with it . Why is that ? You want to tell me why you knew that guy arriving at the airport before jonas even called me ? Believe it or not , my good friend bomani called me . You want to level with me about this woman thing ? I was undercover in africa about three years ago , working with a woman . We were assigned on point on a raid for ... a terrorist training camp . We got the location , but they got her . I knew they were gonna torture her , but I had to do my job . Get back with the intel ... and leave her there . She was still there when the first cruise missile arrived . The missiles were right on target . It was considered a good mission . I 'm so sorry , antonio . Oh , my god , you just made the whole thing up . Oh , screw you . What , you don 't need a story to trust me , jaime . Just trust me ! I 'm off to berkut to show what we learned in school today ! I 'm right behind you ! This is all you got ? I 'll run some tests on it . How long is it gonna take for you to run these tests ?

I want you to be comfortable here . - Hi . - Hey , becs . I 'm so sorry i had to leave you earlier . Look , don 't screw this one up , okay ? He 's a great guy . He 's smart . Funny , kind . He 's crazy about you . He 's so much better than those loser guys you usually date . Sorry , I know , that 's just how I feel . I know you have a wild self-destructive streak . Just ... just keep that under control , okay ? Okay . Oh , jaime ? I threw out the carbonara . I know how much you love it , but it doesn 't keep , so- - night , becca . Hello . Hey , nathan . Where are you ? I 'm in bed . Really ? What are you wearing ? Ugh , focus , nathan . Why are you calling me ? Ah , to gloat . I ran my little tests on that ridiculously small so-called piece of evidence you guys game me , and already- - bop bop bop ! Ve a solid lead on where the guy might be . Fill me in . What you guygave m me was a piece of the sole of a high-end sneaker . On it was chlorinated residue found in residential fountains . I trac it back to the waterfall apartments . Antonio is on his way over there right now . Is there a team on the way ? Now , he said the guy would see that a mile away . he 's He 's gonna handle it by himself . without me ? Well , he said not to bother you . Just let you sleep . Said he could handle it . Now would be the part where you say , " wow , nathan " That 's really , really great work . You 're so smart and HOT and- - " she exited the building . She appears unarmed . Where 'd she go ? Why are you following me ? You 're gonna have to talk to agent hastings . You gotta be kidding me .

How can I argue with- - they know you we h here . They 're sending more agents as we speak . Just stay away from here . stay away from her What are you doing here ? I thought I told nathan to let you sleep . We 're partrtrs . Yeah . You 're right . Let 's go do this . He 's gone . Antonio is communicating with the assassin . are you sure ? You want to argue with the ear ? Of course I 'm sure ! You know , think about it . He knew the president was arriving sooner than you did . He told nathan not to bother me , He just stood there lying me . Going through the motions . And what did you do ? Well , nothing . I just pretended i didn 't hear him . Look , I haven 't been doing this very long , remember ? Nono , you did fine. you did fine . I knew he was stationed in imara five years ago , and I knew he had strong feelings about the leadership there , but I didn 't know they were this strong . You 're gonna have to bring him in . No , actually , you 're gonna have to bring him in . You 're gonna give antonio false information that the prent oimara is changing his box at the racetrack . We 'll stay on his ass . Bust him and the shooter . A little change of plans . Oh , really . Rudhan 's security told us they 've changed the location of the president 's box . He 's now gonna be sitting down below . Right there . that totally changes the sniper sig-we . Yep . What do want to do ? I 'll take the tower . And you can take this other one . We can cover this , right ? Yeah . Okay . Let 's go do it . What 's up with you today ? Nothing . Something happen with you and cia dude ? Maybe . I won 't say i told you so , but they never seem to work out in this line of work . If that 's the truth , then why do you still do it ? Sometimes I don 't know . Sorry I didn 't call . I heard you took out two of my agents . I can 't believe you had me followed . Thanks for the vote of confidence . Whoa , that 's not why they followed you . Really Why then ? When someone in the cia starts A ... relationship ... they have to tell the organizati . And then they check that person out , that 's all . So I told them that you were my girlfriend on paper . Right . You know are you who you say you are , and do you live where you say you live ? Normal stuff in our line of work . Ok . Are you okay with that ? Well , not being followed , but the other thing . I don 't know . I ha so much going on right now . Well , what 's going on ? I can 't tell you . - I 'll call you later , okay ? - All right . ladies and gentlemen , the official results are in on race eight . Sabrina 's bride in first paying $ 12 . 80 . Straight up no out in second paying $ 5 . 90 . Hannah 's gold to show paying $ 4 . 50 . the horses are on their way to the gate for the bay maiden cup . A graded stakes race for the million dollar purse . All betting windows are now open . tell me what the hell is going on ? I heard you with the assassin . I know you 're in on this . Did you tell jonas ? I had to tell him . I 'm not working with the assassin , but I do know her . Her ? Will you just tell me the truth ? We were stationed together in imara about three years ago . We saw a lot of bad things . She 's been working underground against the imaran government ever since . She 's in too deep . She 's lost . It happens . When I heard about the assassination attempt , I felt like it might be her . The night at the airport I found a cartridge . Hand-loaded . One done by her . that is as distinctive as a fingerprint . Once I knew it was her , I tried to stop her . I tried to talk her out of it at the motel the night you saw me . Told her that this was a bad idea . That we were onto her . But I couldn 't bring myself to take her down . She saved my life more than once , jaime . That- - that makes it a little hard to put a bullet in her . Why the hell should I believe any of what you 're saying ? Because I 'm asking you too . You 've gotta believe me on this one . I 'm trying to stop this thing just as much as you are . Wait a minute . If jonas thinks i 'm in on this , he probably had you feed me some false information about where rudhan is sitting . He did . Oh , sheesh . Jaime , that makes this guy an open target . We cannot allow him to die on american soil . You take the president . I 'll take the sniper . and they 're running.It 's a clean start as imara victor breaks out rapidly and moves to the inside .

You 've been working private sector ops too long . But then you were always good at walking away from things . Look , I didn 't walk away from you . I had to complete the mission . You know that .

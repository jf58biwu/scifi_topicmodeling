 SILAS : Previously on Kings ... I Iooked up and saw a great swarm of butterflies , upon my head like a crown . God 's signal to begin . SAVOY : Did you guys hear ? The squad got pinched . The bastards ambushed them . They took hostages . That 's Jack Benjamin . You saved the King 's son . You 're going to get shown off . You 're going to take a pretty picture with my father , and then get sent back to wherever you came from . I 'm a man with position offering you a thank you . Even if you ask for half my kingdom , as the saying goes . He 'II be trouble , you watch . The only way to deal with him is a bullet . Everyone thinks I 'm brave , but I 'm not . Be brave now . DAVID : ( SHOUTING ) You want blood ? I surrender ! Shoot me and call that enough ! It 's a peace treaty . They 're offering us a truce . This truce might not be the best thing for the country right now . Shepherd 's stunt was too grand a gesture . My hands are tied . Call the Treasury . Pull the gold . But I was thinking I might stay . It feels like the braver thing . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Don 't go ! Don 't go . Don 't go . ( SIGHS ) ROSE : There are days when things must be right . Today , things must be perfect . They come as we speak . Our enemy . And we must treat them as friends . Processional , signing , reception . Every detail has been carefully chosen , and details count . Seating charts can alter the course of delicate history . Battles lost for want of a dessert spoon . We can change the world today . So long as we provide perfection . The day is beginning , sir . And a good day it will be . I 'm feeling Iuckier already . Two inches from the King 's coffee . Mind the eaves . ( SIRENS WAILING ) They 've reached Shiloh . That one 's fine . Fine is for every other day . If today goes as it should ... As it will . Some photographer is going to snap the picture to keep the memory of the day you made peace with the implacable . And I 'II be damned if in it , your tie is just fine . They 're going to sign . You did it . Without any Reverend . That 's right . AII by yourself . Mmm . You were right about Shepherd . He 's a bad omen . We have a chance at peace , finally . Anything goes wrong , we could be plunged back into the black of war . Take him out . Today might not be the best time . As soon as the treaty is signed . Use your best . Order given . Radio silent . Nervous people challenging my assumptions . Hanson , you look two steps off awful . Treaty looks good , though . Thank you , sir . Pencils , Perry ? Sharp , sir . FEMALE REPORTER ON TV : Relations between Gath and Gilboa are historically contentious , going back to the previous century . But since the end of hostilities at the front , we have ... ( SOFTLY ) sleep well ? How was breakfast ? Shh ! Pay attention . Forward march ! Detail , halt ! So , do we shake hands ? Or shall we wait till there 's something to shake over ? Good thought . Join hands over things accomplished , not intended . Two pens , one paper . We are close , gentlemen . We sign our names . We shake hands . And future ghosts know us for our contributions , not our wars . Who 's in ? FEMALE REPORTER : Never before has so much hope pinned on one crucial moment . Mom , you made it . Hey . Come on in . They 're about to sign . Let 's just get down to Veterans ' Affairs and get EIi 's check so I can get back home . Yeah , Mom , we will . You just got here . You should see this . This is what EIi died for . FEMALE REPORTER : We have every indication that this treaty will be treated not only as a permanent truce between the countries , but as an opportunity to open up the borders to trade . We need to review the treaty first . I assure you the treaty is as we last left it . Every word consistent . Just a moment . Before all that ... Where 's your Captain , David Shepherd ? I 'd Iike to meet the man who offered the peace we accepted . He 's not here ? I 'm afraid not . We were of a mind to security . Entry limited to only the essential . FEMALE REPORTER : Given the scope of the agreement ... They 're not signing . It was your brother 's sacrifice that got them there . Now , we get to watch them squander it . You don 't have to do this , David . Staying in Shiloh . I 'm not coming home , Mom . Not yet . You have your family , your press . If we are to sign , he should be here as well . Don 't you think ? We 'II gladly wait . FEMALE REPORTER : Not certain what 's going on ... DAVID : Why aren 't they signing ? You 're just one boy . What good can you do here against all that ? ( CELL PHONE VIBRATING ) Some conversation that we 'll try to pick up between our King and Gath Premier Shaw . Okay . It looks ... It 's the peace talks . They 're asking for me . I 'II be back as soon as I can . David . It 's the King . David , wait . Don 't go . I have to . Go away . Shoo ! Yeah . They 're not shooing . Thomasina is going to be mad . I hate it when she gets mad . Five days . No break , no sleep . But he gets to lunch with the Premier . You 're going to table . Five-course meal , napkin in lap , bread on your left . White wine , red wine , water goblet . The King always grabs the wrong glass . So , if you 're sitting on his right , expect not to have one . Silverware . Start from the outside . Move in . Understand . We are far from finished . Do nothing to screw this up . These are volatile people . We can give them no excuse to take offense . You just keep getting into trouble . I 'm trying to memorize goblet order and all I can think about is my mom . She 's in Shiloh today . My brother ... I know some people in Veterans ' Affairs . Maybe I can get someone to help her . Walk her through it . Don 't worry . You think you 're ready for this ? SILAS : He 's ready enough . Sir , what you 've done today , getting Gath here to sign for peace ... If there 's anything I can do ... Being King means never sleeping through the night . An old enemy said that before I had him executed . People ask how I cope with all the responsibilities , millions of souls relying on all the good air in my lungs . It 's an easy secret . Every day , I Iook for signs in my Iife and try to read into them God 's intentions . Take a good look at your life right now , Captain . And think hard . What does God want you to do today ? To shut the hell up . So be it . Premier Shaw . Captain Shepherd . The hero of Gilboa , slayer of tanks . I imagined a giant . Sir . AII I 've seen in my Iife , I 'm not often moved . You did a rare thing . I 'm sorry , sir . You have no seat . That 's not possible . I 'm sorry , sir . It 's the case . It 's the seating chart . Then , change it . Go ask the Queen . The Queen spoke plain . No more changes . Not invited to table ? The Crown Prince ? Just offering my regrets . State Iuncheons . I have better things to do . Mrs. Shepherd . David told me you were here . He wanted to be here , himself , but he was called away . I 'm a friend of his . He told me why you 've come . I 'm so sorry about your son . I know the red tape can be sticky here . I just wanted to see if I could make anything easier for you . I can see why he likes you . If you really want to help me , help me get David back home . I know you think he doesn 't belong here . ( LAUGHS ) Oh , no , I ... I don 't want him to leave because he doesn 't belong . I 'm scared he does . He 's my son . I knew before anyone he was born different . And to call seven sons , a mother knows . Now , this one , you protect from what wants to happen . He has a destiny in him . People with destinies , things don 't go well for them . They die old and unhappy or young and unfinished . No . Not for him . ( INDISTINCT WHISPERING ) He looks to be enjoying himself . Maybe a partner after all . Not so sure about him . I don 't think General Malek much wants to be here . And what about you , Captain ? What do you think about our treaty ? Do you believe your people are willing to accept sacrificing to their hated enemy ? I want to hear a simple soldier 's opinion . Is your country ready for peace ? To be honest , I was instructed not to speak , for fear of saying something stupid and jeopardizing the treaty . It 's that important to everyone here , and it 's that important to me . My brother died . And this treaty is the only thing that can give that any meaning . So , if it 's not too rude , I 'm going to follow my orders for once . Keep my mouth shut and just try to use the right glass . ( LAUGHING ) He 's proving useful after all . Stay the order ? When we leave , wherever he stands , he dies . ABNER : But , sir ... That 's not going to work . It will . Don 't bother . You give up . I don 't . That 's what 's different about us . No , you 're scared of Thomasina . That 's the difference . Yes ! Master of the birds ! Sometimes , you should maybe listen to me . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) We 've traveled far , haven 't we ? Pretty damn , sir . You 're a hell of a commander . Well , my father doesn 't think I represent . The old man doesn 't know fig from fart . We 'II be at war forever with him as King . I know it 's been hard . You 've given your bones . Stopped the clock on your lives . I don 't have the power to change all that , as much as I 'd do well with it . But , I do wield an ample slice of the Treasury . Who wants to weigh some money ? JACK : Private . Hey . Don 't worry about it . Heads up . For your mom . Oh , no . This is all wrong . Miss . Mmm-hmm . This soldier has been valiantly defending your country . Maybe you should take him into the dressing room and make sure that fits . Soldier , you do as the nice lady says . You sell cars here ? And where does the great hero of Gilboa hail from ? I grew up on a farm near Port Prosperity . You mean the Port of Sorrow . We have a different name for it . My father died defending that land . I try to call it by the name he did . Excuse me . ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) ( CHUCKLES ) old habits . Stealing desserts . You went there to help my mom . She called me . Oh , I just wanted to help , or say hello . Not my best idea . Everyone else in your family always sends someone . In a sea of fish , you 're the mermaid . She ... She doesn 't think you 're safe in Shiloh . Yeah , she might have a point . You 're the only person in the city I can trust , and I only ever see you in the hallway . Well , as far as I know , life happens in hallways . Not the time for that , young man . Maybe later , if we make it through the day ... Maybe we could ... I don 't have an actual idea . None needed . I 'd Iike that . Go . I see you 're still nose to nose in private corners . Obviously , not too private . You know , it was nice that you took an interest in him when he was the press ' darling . But that card 's been played . I 'm not playing a card . Well , you should be . A boy like that , he 's ... He 's innocent now . But he 'II get a taste of manor life soon enough and then ... You know , he 'II start enjoying things . Desire for comfort replaces desire proper all too quickly . And the chairs here are very soft . I picked them myself . Give him the nod . Enough , Iet 's have at it . ( BELL CHIMES ) ( FOOTSTEPS MARCHING ) My wife commands an army . Ours wouldn 't want to face allies . ( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT WHISPERING ) There 's an inconsistency in the treaty . Water rights in the west are in your favor . This is not what we agreed . No , I assure you that 's correct . Amended by the percentages you requested . Your King built your country on lies like this . He won 't have us anymore . If there 's an issue , we can fix it later . You 've come all this way . It 's just two words on a page . Yes , it 's words that you twist to your advantage . We will not sign this . Fix it and we 'II be back . Wait . You can 't . You can 't do this . please . please . please . Get off of him . Our great hero 's just a jog , and a stupid one at that . Cry for your brother again . See what answer you get this time . Lay a hand on me now . I beg you , give me the reason . This is an insult . There will be no treaty . Congratulations , Shepherd . We 're going back to war . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) MAN : The Queen was already unhappy , you and the Prince didn 't attend at table . And now , she doesn 't know what to do about anything . Being foul to everyone . And the King ? He hasn 't said a word since Gath left . Just scary quiet , the way he gets . They say it 's the worst day the King has ever had . Treasury . Have them announce it now . Let 's see if we can 't make a bad day worse . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) You look tired , David . I keep having bad dreams . Disturbing ? No more than when I 'm awake . You 'II be fine . I really screwed up . Yeah . I saw that . Not your finest hour . I always have bad dreams in the city . Something about Shiloh . They say that dreams are a 60th part prophesy . Here , maybe even more . The key ... Read the signs . Find out what it is that they are trying to tell you . " Don 't go . " I shouldn 't have come today . Maybe . Where are you going ? Where I should have been all along . We have the response from Gath . They said they 'd reconsider leaving . They 've agreed to hold for three hours so we can weigh a new demand . They want an additional 10 kilometers into the north , and all the water rights to compensate for bad faith and personal insult . There 's nothing to be done . They never intended to sign . It 's not Shepherd 's fault . They were just looking for an excuse . If it hadn 't been one thing , it would have been another . The pattern in the rug . AII to lead us on . And maybe break our hearts in the offing . Sir ? This house is on fire ! Whatever it is can wait ! It 's the Treasury . They 're saying it 's empty . Bankrupt . But I don 't understand how . SILAS : He didn 't . It 's treason , what you 've done . You cut your strings . You think I 'd just let you stand ? What we 've built , over decades ? AII the country , gone in days ? AII gone because of your grudge ? AII gone on the day that we could have had peace ? We 'II all be stronger for it , in time with real leadership . This country is at its best when its King Iistens to me . Do you hate the idea of peace , or just the lost opportunity of more profit ? Or maybe you just can 't stand that someone had a thought to defy you . It doesn 't matter why I want the war to continue . Only that I do . Was it that sad in here , William ? Were you that lonely ? I could have had any number of women sent over . And look where we are now ? Go ahead . Killing me won 't change a thing . Your country dies with me . Oh , no . Things will change . I 'II stand , and you will watch me do it . I don 't die in a corner . I plow through or break a wall . How do you think I got to be King ? By begging me . We 'II see . Car . Small detail . Countryside , sir ? No , Gehenna . We 're going to hell . Excuse me . I 'm sorry , but there seems to be a problem with your card . It 's been declined . My card 's linked to the Royal Treasury . Run it again . I did . ( SCOFFS ) My card 's been declined ? My card 's been declined . ( ALL LAUGH ) Uh-oh ! I hope there 's no problem at the Treasury . MAN ON TV : No reason whatsoever for alarm . There 's still some time before the clock runs out , and we still remain hopeful that a settlement can be reached . I assure you that the King is personally engaged . There 's no hope , is there ? My boy . ... round the clock conference with negotiators from both sides . It 's all my fault . I 'm sure they 'd let you think that . They only use people like us . Look what they do . Make me wait all day just to get paid because my son died ! To hell with them , their death benefit . Remember , Gath is not our enemy ... Why did he die unless something good happens today ? ( CHUCKLES ) There 's no meaning in his death , David . No benefit . This is just pain . ( CHATTERING CONTINUES ) Come home . Let 's have no more of it . ... on both sides , eager for the coming peace . Open it . Abadon . Vesper . Huh ! He is awake also . Bad dreams , I 'II wager . I warned you . Being King means never sleeping through the night again . It 's day . ( SIGHS ) You got the Schiller ? Working on my translation . The verse is fighting me tonight . Today . So the bad days outweigh the good . Long time takes its toll . You start to see things , you 're not quite sure are there . ( CHUCKLES ) I used to fight it . Force the distinction . Is , isn 't . After a while it got boring , so I just gave in . And being mad means you 'II never be lonely again . ( LAUGHS ) I don 't have that good fortune . No , you saw too clearly . That can 't be fun . There 's a black weight on you . Looks like a squid over your head . AII goes well in my Kingdom . Your Kingdom ? Oh . It used to be half mine , until Silas came and took it and built his monstrosity and told them all I was dead . ( CHUCKLES ) Your people celebrated when I said so . The bloody King of Carmel , Vesper Abadon , finally falls . They melted your statue into a brick and sunk it into the sea . Shouldn 't have killed so many , maybe . ( LAUGHS ) I see it now . You didn 't come here today to taunt me . You want something . When I marched onto Carmel , your reserves were already empty . The money never found . Is that it ? My gold again ? You hid a nation 's material wealth in a hole or in a bank . I want it today . Where is it ? Thirty years , a king in a box . I haven 't told you yet . Why today ? I could kill you . You won 't kill me . I 'm the only one who ever tells you the truth . Waste of a day this turned out to be . Getting nothing done . She 's alive ? You spared her ? She 's a grown woman now . She lives well . You waited all these years until you needed something to show me this . And you think you had patience ? She 's not alone in the picture . There are others ? alive ? Who else ? please . please . The gold . No truth whatsoever to the rumors of problems with our Treasury . You are all welcome to go to your banks and check . Just a move . The gold being taken to a new location , prompting a system error . I ' m no system error . I ' m his damn benefactor . Where did he get that much gold ? Is all that really necessary ? This isn 't your concern . Well , it is , when it spoils my plans . I want you to stop this stupid game . Game ? Your husband ... My husband is a brat . But no more so than my brother . Mmm . I can 't have you two spoiling the holidays . ( ROSE CHUCKLES ) This thing between you . Let 's just call it done . He 's gone too far this time . And I 'm sure you went too far right on back . Then him again , your serve . The match has to end . No more retaliations , huh ? You take his last play on the chin . Why would I do that ? When we banished Andrew from court , we had good reason . But he could find himself invited back . Your life is too empty , William . It 'd be nice to have your son around again . Wouldn 't you say ? MICHELLE : Two minutes to the hour . Then they 're gone . Don 't blame David for what happened . He was only trying to help , see through your goals . People like him only make you a stronger king . Maybe you defend him too well . Oh ! Don 't you start lecturing me on class distinction and social hierarchy . You , yourself , were scandalously poor once . I don 't care about that . I wonder how he 'd react if he knew about you . The story that I 'd wager good money you haven 't shared with him . I think he might surprise you . Oh , you 're going to make me come out and say it ? Have you forgotten your vow ? I Iove you so much it embarrasses us both . So you know I take no joy . You once asked me to bear witness so that it ever appeared that you forget , I should be there to remind you . I didn 't want the job , but I 'm doing it because you asked . And so I have . ( CLOCK CHIMING ) So close . ( NEWSCAST ) I just wish there was something I could tell them . Something I could do . There 's nothing you can do . WOMAN ON TV : ... is yet to be explained . It 's uncertain at this time , but there might be some connection between this abrupt departure and the news that the Treasury was bankrupt earlier today . ( INAUDIBLE ) Stop the car , stop the car . JESSIE : What ? Stop the car ! I need you to get out . JESSIE : Why , honey ? I 'II explain later , okay ? What are you doing ? Sorry , man . I need the car . What 's going on , man ? It 's an emergency . It 's an emergency . Come on . Whoa ! Whoa ! David ! Hey ! Come on man , that 's my cab ! Hey , that 's my cab ! Hey ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) SOLDIER 1 : Out of the car ! SOLDIER 2 : Put your hands up ! SOLDIER 3 : Out of the car ! SOLDIER 1 : Don 't move ! SOLDIER 2 : Show me your hands . Don 't go ! SOLDIER 3 : Stop or I 'II shoot ! SOLDIER 2 : Keep your hands up ! please ! Hands up ! You have to finish this ! That 's your message ? please ! You think you can make peace ? There is no peace ! There never will be 'til every one of you is dead ! Everyone you love is dead ! SOLDIER 3 : Back away from him . Back away ! SOLDIER 2 : Hold your position ! Get down ! Stand down now ! Drop your weapons now ! Stand down ! Put your weapons down . I said back ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Get back ! Drop your weapon ! Stand down ! Stand down ! Why don 't we take a walk ? You want it over , too . I believe that . But your generals , they won 't let you . Gath is its military . And a boy destroyed one of our tanks . They 've been shamed . What will it take to make them stop ? Not some petty tariffs or a stretch of rock . What do you need to bring to them ? What 's the real cost of real peace ? My people have no hope for better . They see how you live , and they want it . They want this . Industry , games , cranes , Shiloh . The dream you gave them . They want my city ? I 'II do you one better . I 'II give you the means to make your own . Port Prosperity . A world center of trade . I took it from you , and with it , built Shiloh . Take it back . You build something with it for your people . Not your generals . Prosperity or the opportunity for it . Get your generals in line . Issue peace . Real , lasting . Six months hence , under Gath control . Your people won 't accept it . They 'II learn to if they know the reason . If you will accept . ( CAMERAS CLICKING ) I made an offer and Gath accepted . We will , in six months ' time , give over Port Prosperity in exchange for lasting peace . ( SCATTERED MURMURING ) It will be difficult . But it 's a sacrifice we 'II be glad for , in time . Michelle . THOMASINA : Sir . You 've had a busy day . Sir . That 's not a very detailed account of your actions . Sir , I just knew I couldn 't let them leave . There 's an upper limit to tolerance . Are you trying to get sent home , Captain ? No . I need to be here , sir . What you did today , saving the treaty , making peace . They don 't understand what you 've done for us , what you do . But I 've seen it , and I 'm in awe . You were chosen to be King for a reason . When I read the signs , in my Iife , they say that I was sent here to help you . What I can do for you , I will . Then do that . Another matter . My daughter . Doesn 't seem very interested . Then no matter at all then . You believe him , that he 's loyal ? We have nothing to fear from him . He acts in our favor . And fortune clearly favors him . Some people make me a stronger king . Abort the operation . What ? Then get word through , now . Our man went radio silent after your order . It may be too late to stop him . ( CLANGING ) What are we going to do ? Get it done . No bird 's telling me what to do . Is that a grenade ? Wait ! ( EXCLAIMS ) Check fire ! Birds are gone , ma 'am .

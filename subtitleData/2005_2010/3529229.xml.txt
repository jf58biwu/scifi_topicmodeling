HE 'S THE WORST INTERVIEW . IT 'S OKAY . JUST LET HIM GO , BILLIE . WE HAVE ENOUGH . ( Jean ) PREVIOUSLY ON PHAETON TV ... SIX MONTHS AGO , THE RESEARCH VESSEL PHAETON WAS LAUNCHED ON AN EXTRAORDINARY MISSION TO THE DISTANT STAR EPSILON ERIDANI IN THE SEARCH FOR INTELLIGENT LIFE IN ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM . BUT ONLY A FEW MONTHS INTO THE JOURNEY , SCIENTISTS HAVE MADE A SHOCKING DISCOVERY- - THAT EARTH WILL BECOME UNINHABITABLE WITHIN A CENTURY . NOW THIS MISSION OF EXPLORATION HAS BECOME A MISSION OF SALVATION . WITH THE HOPES OF BILLIONS RIDING ON THEIR SHOULDERS , 12 BRAVE ASTRONAUTS NOW APPROACH THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION OF THEIR LIVES- - GO OR NO GO , LEAVE THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND JOURNEY FOR TEN YEARS OR TURN AROUND AND COME HOME . THE STAKES ARE ENORMOUS . THE DRAMA INTENSE . AND YOU 'RE ALONG FOR EVERY STEP OF THE WAY . EDGE OF NEVER , PHAETON TV , ONLY ON FOX . ONCE WE PASSED NO / NO GO , THAT 'S WHEN WE ENGAGED THE ORION DRIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME . UH , IT 'S THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY , WITHOUT WHICH PHAETON WOULD NEVER BE CAPABLE OF THE NEAR-LIGHT SPEEDS THAT WILL LET US REACH ANOTHER STAR SYSTEM IN A MATTER OF YEARS INSTEAD OF LIFETIMES . I GREW UP IN A FAMILY OF LIARS . AND I HATE NOTHING WORSE THAN BEING LIED TO . THE PHYSICS BEHIND IT ARE ACTUALLY QUITE REVOLUTIONARY . THAT 'S GREAT , JULES . EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED . THANK YOU .

MEYER IS IN AIRLOCK C. OKAY , JEAN , TELL ME I 'M WRONG ABOUT THIS . ( Jean ) I 'M SORRY , DOCTOR , BUT I ESTIMATE A 6.3 % DECREASE IN DOPAMINE ACTIVITY IN THE BASAL GANGLIA , ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN TRANSITION METALS IN THE SUBSTANTIA NIGRA . IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP YOU WITH ? NO , JEAN . THAT 'S ALL . [ beep ] ALL DOCTORS REALLY WORK UNDER PRESSURE , EH , BECAUSE AS A DOCTOR , YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES ALL THE TIME , AND WE 'RE TRAINED TO DO SO . HEY , DOC . YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ? YES .

DR. FALLON , YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ? BILLIE , GOOD . COME IN . SIT DOWN . I , UH , FINISHED A ROUGH CUT OF YESTERDAY 'S SHOOT , AND I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE THIS . AS PHAETON APPROACHES OUR FINAL GO / NO GO POINT WHERE A SLINGSHOT AROUND NEPTUNE CAN SEND US HOME ... OH , GOD . OR LAUNCH US INTO DEEP SPACE AND THE NEXT PHASE OF OUR FIVE-YEAR JOURNEY TO ERIDANI , THE AIR OF TENSION ABOARD IS PALPABLE . THAT 'S TERRIBLE . BILLIE , YOU 'RE A NATURAL . AND IT 'S NOT JUST ME THAT THINKS SO . FIVE BILLION VIEWERS CAN 'T BE WRONG . WHAT ? FIVE BILLION . [ chuckles ] THAT 'S THE BEST RATINGS WE 'VE HAD SINCE THE LAUNCH , AND IT 'S WAY BETTER THAN ANYTHING I GOT WHEN I WAS HOST . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? I 'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE CONSORTIUM , AND WE 'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT . I 'M STILL GONNA PRODUCE THE SHOW , BUT FROM NOW ON , YOU 'RE GONNA BE THE VOICE OF PHAETON . YOU 'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING , RIGHT ? YOU 'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT JUST CAN 'T BE BOUGHT . PEOPLE RELATE TO YOU . I DON 'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA . LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS- - YOU 'RE DOING ME A FAVOR . I 'M A SHRINK . I WAS NEVER ANY GOOD AT ANY OF THIS . AS THE REALITIES OF THIS MISSION SINK IN , I 'M GONNA BE GETTING A LOT MORE PATIENTS THROUGH MY DOOR . DR. FALLON , I DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY . WELL , SAY YES . [ sighs ] YES . [ laughing ] YES . SAY YES . ( Jean ) EXCUSE ME , DR. FALLON . MANNY AND VAL WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU . OH , THIS 'LL BE FUN . CONGRATULATIONS , BILLIE . I 'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU . ( Jean ) IT 'S TWO DAYS AND COUNTING UNTIL THE PHAETON REACHES NEPTUNE , AND IT 'S THE DECISION WE 'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR- - GO OR NO GO . AND WHILE LIFE IS SWEET FOR KENJI AND ALICE , THINGS ARE STILL SALTY FOR VAL AND MANNY . ARE THERE JUST TOO MANY COOKS IN THIS KITCHEN ? PHAETON TV , THE EDGE OF NEVER . WEDNESDAYS AT 10 : 00 ONLY ON FOX . I DON 'T WANT ANY MORE FOOTAGE OF US ARGUING ENDING UP ON THE SHOW . LOOK , I AM CONSTANTLY GETTING NOTES FROM OUR NETWORK PARTNERS ASKING FOR MORE CONFLICT IN THE SERIES . YOU 'RE CONSTANTLY MAKING US INTO BITCHY KINGS . QUEENS . BITCHY QUEENS . GUYS , MAYBE THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF THE PUBLIC KNEW WHAT WE KNOW , BUT THAT 'S NOT THE CASE . I DIDN 'T SIGN UP FOR THIS . I DIDN 'T SIGN UP TO BE AN INTERSTELLAR PUNCH LINE , ALL RIGHT ? WELL ... [ sighs ] LOOK , THINGS ARE MUCH WORSE THAN THE PUBLIC KNOWS BACK HOME . DRY LAND IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE COMMODITY . THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS CONSIDERING RELOCATION VISAS FOR ANYONE WANTING TO MOVE FROM THE COASTAL REGIONS INLAND . IT IS THAT BAD ? IT WILL BE . GETTING ON ONE OF THESE VISA LISTS IS GONNA BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT . [ laughs ] I DON 'T KNOW WHY YOU 'RE LAUGHING . I-I HAVE FAMILY IN LONDON , AND YOU HAVE FAMILY IN--IN FLORIDA , RIGHT ? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? IF I DON 'T COOPERATE , THEN MY FAMILY DOESN 'T GET A VISA ? THE CONSORTIUM IS A VERY POWERFUL COMPANY . THEY 'RE GONNA BE WILLING TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HELP THEM TO MAKE MONEY . NOW , I-I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO PAINT ME AS THE VILLAIN HERE , BUT REALLY , I 'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU . WE 'LL DO IT . WE 'LL DO IT . YOUR FAMILY WILL NEED HELP . I DO LOVE YOU , YOU KNOW . YOU SHOULD . ( Jean ) ATTENTION , ALL CREW . PLEASE REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO THE BRIEFING ROOM . SO ANY QUESTIONS ? YEAH , I HAVE QUESTIONS . HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ABOUT THIS , AND WHY ARE THE REST OF US JUST HEARING ABOUT IT NOW ? THAT 'S REALLY NOT THE ISSUE . WITH ALL DUE RESPECT , SIR , THE HELL IT ISN 'T . WOULD YOU GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE ? I 'M JUST DOING MY JOB . DID SOMEONE GIVE YOU A JOB TO DO ? LET 'S JUST TRY AND ABSORB ALL OF THE INFORMATION BEFORE WE MAKE ACCUSATIONS , SHALL WE ? I 'M SORRY , ROGER , BUT IT 'S A QUESTION , NOT AN ACCUSATION . AND HERE 'S YOUR ANSWER . DOCTOR CAME TO ME YESTERDAY WITH HIS PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS . I ASKED HIM TO TAKE SOME MORE TIME TO CONFIRM IT . HE DID , AND NOW YOU 'RE BEING BRIEFED . PARKINSON 'S ? IS IT FATAL ? NO . BUT IT CAN LEAD TO SOME PRETTY SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS . NOW , SO FAR , I 'VE ONLY EXPERIENCED A FEW SYMPTOMS AND ONLY INTERMITTENTLY- - SOME HAND TREMORS , UH , CRAMPED HANDWRITING . WHAT COMES NEXT ? DO YOU START DROOLING ? WELL , THE SYMPTOMS AND THEIR RATE OF PROGRESSION VARIES BY INDIVIDUAL . BUT COMMONLY , WE SEE PROBLEMS WITH BALANCE , UH , MOBILITY , LATER WITH SPEECH AND SWALLOWING , UH , FATIGUE . BILLIE , I AM NOT KIDDING . I WILL ANNIHILATE YOU . I 'M JUST DOING MY JOB . JUST TURN IT OFF ! [ overlapping shouting ] OKAY , CALM DOWN , SUE . PUT IT AWAY ! PUT IT AWAY ! LET 'S TURN IT OFF , BILLIE . LET 'S JUST ALL TRY AND STAY FOCUSED . SHALL I CONTINUE ? PLEASE . UH , PROBLEMS WITH SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS AND DEMENTIA , INCLUDING HALLUCINATIONS AND PARANOIA , ARE POSSIBLE LATE-TERM DEVELOPMENTS . ALL RIGHT , THIS CAN BE TREATED WITH MEDICATION , RIGHT ? SO THE ONLY RELEVANT QUESTION HERE IS , " DO WE HAVE THE MEDICATIONS ? " YES ... WELL , TO VARYING DEGREES . AND , YES , BUT ONLY IN LIMITED SUPPLIES . WE DIDN 'T PLAN FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS . OKAY . WELL , WE WERE COMING UP ON THE GO / NO GO DECISION POINT ANYWAY . ALL THIS MEANS IS THAT WE 'RE FACING IT A LITTLE SOONER THAN WE ANTICIPATED . I SAY GO . DEMENTIA , HALLUCINATIONS , PARANOIA- - ARE WE ALL GETTING A VOTE ? [ overlapping shouting ] KIDS ! NO ONE 'S VOTING . THIS ISN 'T A DEMOCRACY . I 'LL MAKE THE FINAL DECISION AFTER HEARING THE DOCTOR 'S PERSONAL AND MEDICAL ASSESSMENT . NOR IS ANYONE ELSE GONNA BE BRIEFING MISSION CONTROL OR THE CONSORTIUM ABOUT THIS SITUATION . YOU GOT THAT , ROGER ? AND BY THE WAY , THIS ISN 'T THE ONLY SAFETY ISSUE WE 'RE FACING RIGHT NOW . JEAN 'S GOT A LIST AS LONG AS MY ARM , ANY ONE OF WHICH CAN SCREW UP THIS MISSION . SO IF YOU WANT TO BE PRODUCTIVE , START DEALING WITH THEM . I 'M JUST PLAYING A ROLE . WE ALL PLAY ROLES ALL THE TIME . WE BECOME MORE ... DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN THEM IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS . I THINK , FROM AN AUDIENCE PERSPECTIVE , IT 'S VERY EXCITING . I THINK IT 'S AS REAL AS IT COULD POSSIBLY BE , AND ... IT MAKES VERY GOOD TELEVISION . IT 'S ALWAYS SO DAMN RESTFUL HERE . MM , NOT ALWAYS . OH , THERE ARE STORMS SOMETIMES . THE LAST ONE ALMOST TOOK OUT THE SUPPORTS UNDER THIS BALCONY . I 'M IN THE MOOD FOR A STORM RIGHT ABOUT NOW . THAT COULD BE ARRANGED . TALK TO ME . YOU JUST GONNA USE THIS MEYER THING AS AN EXCUSE TO DUMP THE WHOLE MISSION ? EXCUSE ? I 'M NOT SAYING THAT WE 'VE NOT HAD AN IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF SETBACKS , BUT IT ALMOST SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU 'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A REASON TO ABORT . IF WE 'RE GONNA GO FORWARD WITH THIS THING , WE 'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE 'RE FACING . I MEAN , COME ON . MEYER HAS GOT PARKINSON 'S . YEAH , I WAS AT THE BRIEFING . WHAT 'S GOING ON ... REALLY ? IT 'S NOT THE- - THE FACTS OF WHAT THEY TOLD US , SO MUCH ... IT 'S THE TIMING . I MEAN , ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER , OKAY ? HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT SHOE TO DROP ? BUT FOR IT TO GO SO WRONG SO FAST , IT 'S A LOT TO SWALLOW . AND THE CLOSER WE GET TO GO / NO GO , THE TOUGHER IT GETS . YOU 'RE IMPLYING THAT THEY 'RE LYING TO US . THIS IS A $ 200-BILLION PROJECT . YEAH . THEY 'RE NOT GONNA START PLAYING GAMES . MAYBE IT 'S SOME KIND OF TEST . [ chuckles ] OF WHAT ? OF ME . I 'VE BEEN GETTING THIS FEELING FOR A WHILE NOW THAT MISSION CONTROL DOESN 'T EXACTLY HAVE THE GREATEST FAITH IN THEIR COMMANDER . COME ON . IT 'S NOT SAID OUT LOUD ON AN OPEN CHANNEL . BUT READING BETWEEN THE LINES , I 'M NOT SO SURE THEY WOULDN 'T RATHER SEE SOMEONE ELSE IN COMMAND UP HERE . HEY ... LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE . MAYBE YOU 'RE RIGHT . MAYBE I 'M OVER-THINKING THIS . YEAH . BUT I- - I 'VE GOT THIS FEELING IN MY GUT . IT JUST DOESN 'T ADD UP . I KNOW THERE 'S SOMETHING THEY 'RE NOT TELLING US . I--I KNOW THAT- - OH . I 'M SORRY . DO--DO GO ON . YOU SHOULD COME TO MY PLACE SOME TIME . YOU 'D LIKE IT- - OPEN AIR , INTERESTING PEOPLE . YEAH , YOU KNOW WHAT , FRANK ? I 'M BORED . COME AND PLAY WITH ME . [ mellow music ] ¶ ¶ [ breathing heavily ] [ ringing ] YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME . WHO 'S CALLING YOU HERE ? I DIDN 'T PROGRAM IT .

UM , I MEAN , LET ME SHOW YOU SOME OF THESE TEST SLIDES I 'VE BEEN WORKING ON . WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED LAST NIGHT ? I HAVE NO IDEA . I DIDN 'T THINK ANY OF US COULD GET INTO SOMEONE ELSE 'S MODULE WITHOUT AN INVITATION AND AN ACCESS CODE . AND I GATHER YOU DIDN 'T EXTEND MY INVITATION TO YOUR LITTLE FRIEND . SO HE COULD EXECUTE US IN THE SACK ? I 'M NOT THAT KINKY . YOU HAVE YOUR MOMENTS . YOU KNOW , IT 'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF STUNT ROGER WOULD PULL IF HE KNEW I WAS CHEATING ON HIM . NO ONE 'S CHEATING ON ANYONE HERE . THIS IS ALL JUST SOME HARMLESS FANTASY . REALLY ? THEN YOU WOULDN 'T MIND IF I TOLD MY HUSBAND , WOULD YOU ? OKAY , FINE . HE 'S NOT A SOFTWARE EXPERT EITHER ; HE 'S JUST A THERAPIST . DOESN 'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO PULL OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS . WELL , THEN SOMEONE ELSE IS SCREWING WITH US . RIGHT . ( Jean ) TONIGHT ON PHAETON TV , THE EDGE OF NEVER ... IT 'S ALL COME DOWN TO THIS . IT 'S TIME FOR THE COMMANDER 'S DECISION . THE WHOLE REASON FOR GOING ON IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL . AND IF I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL , WE WILL GO ON .

LONG-DURATION SPACE MISSIONS PRESENT A PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGE FOR MAINTAINING CREW MOTIVATION , MORALE , AND INDIVIDUAL WELL-BEING . UP TO NOW , EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE OF RELEVANT PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES HAS BEEN BASED ON MISSIONS OF ONLY UP TO TWO YEARS . HOWEVER , THE EXTENDED DURATION OF THE ERIDANI MISSION PRESENTS UNIQUE ISSUES , AS WELL AS PROMISING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER STUDY . THE RE-PURPOSING OF VIRTUAL-REALITY TECHNOLOGY ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN MISSION-CRITICAL SKILLS AS A RECREATIONAL TOOL IS ONE NEW FEATURE THAT IS ALREADY SHOWING GREAT PROMISE AS A--AS A MEANS OF AMELIORATING CREW TENSION AND ENHANCING MORALE . OF COURSE , AS WITH ANY NEW ... THERAPEUTIC TECHNOLOGY , THERE ARE VARIABLES AND--AND UNKNOWNS ... AMONG THEM , CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE CLIENT 'S EXPECTATIONS AND THE--THE STILL UNKNOWN LIMITS OF THE TECHNOLOGY , AS WELL AS PROBLEMS WHICH CAN 'T BE ANTICIPATED ... DUE TO THE UNIQUE FUSION THE TECHNOLOGY ENABLES BETWEEN INTELLIGENT COMPUTER SYSTEMS ... AND THEIR BIOLOGICAL MODELS ... THE HUMAN MIND .

JEAN ! [ breathing heavily ] JEAN . PROGRAM OFF . [ gasps ] [ groans ] JEAN ... FREEZE PROGRAM , JEAN . IT 'S YOUR FANTASY , BILLIE . WHY NOT ENJOY IT ? [ gasping ] [ crying ] I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE ENTIRE PROGRAM OFF-LINE , ALL THE VIRT MODULES , UNTIL I CAN FIX THE PROBLEM . I MEAN , WHAT IF SOMEBODY GETS TRAPPED IN AN EVEN WORSE SITUATION AND STRUGGLES TO GET OUT OF IT LIKE I DID ? THERE COULD BE SYNAPTIC DAMAGE FOR ALL I KNOW . I THINK YOU 'RE RIGHT , BUT I 'M WONDERING IF YOU 'RE TREATING THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT INTELLECTUALLY . YOUR COMPUTER GLITCH THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED , RATHER THAN SOMETHING VERY TRAUMATIC THAT HAPPENED TO YOU PERSONALLY . WELL , NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME , REALLY . I MEAN , PHYSICALLY , IN REALITY , NOTHING HAPPENED . [ scoffs ] IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT , IT 'S NO DIFFERENT THAN A BAD DREAM , AND DREAMS AREN 'T REAL , RIGHT ? WELL , THE EVENTS THEY PORTRAY MAY NOT BE , BUT THE FEELINGS DREAMS EVOKE AND THE MEMORIES THEY LEAVE BEHIND , THEY CAN BE AS REAL AS ANYTHING IN OUR LIVES . BUT I 'M--I 'M CURIOUS WHY YOU CHOSE TO DESCRIBE IT AS A DREAM . I 'M SORRY . UH , WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? WELL , SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT DREAMS ARE THE MIND 'S WAY OF EXPLORING THINGS THAT WOULD ORDINARILY BE SUPPRESSED IN WAKING HOURS . YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT FANTASIES . I DON 'T HAVE A RAPE FANTASY , IF THAT 'S WHAT YOU 'RE GETTING AT . NO , I 'M NOT GETTING AT ANYTHING , BILLIE . I 'M JUST SHOWING YOU YOUR CHOICE OF WORDS . BY DESCRIBING IT AS A DREAM , YOU 'RE IMPLYING IT 'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DREAMT UP , AS IF , IN SOME WAY , YOU BLAME YOURSELF FOR WHAT HAPPENED OR EVEN FEEL YOU DESERVED IT . IT 'S A COMPUTER GLITCH , AND THAT 'S ALL IT IS . [ door opens ] THE VIRT MODULES WERE YOUR BABY , ROGER . YOU FOUGHT TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE MISSION . NOW YOU WANT THEM SHUT DOWN ? WELL , ACTUALLY , IT 'S THE LAST THING I WANT , BUT THE SAFETY OF THE CREW HAS TO BE PARAMOUNT . " IN PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS , THE PHAETON MISSION " WILL AMOUNT TO FORCED CONFINEMENT FOR 12 PEOPLE FOR TEN YEARS . " THAT 'S VERY CLEVER , FRANK . " WITHOUT THE ABILITY " TO ESCAPE THE CONFINES OF THEIR METAL TUBE PERIODICALLY " TO EXPERIENCE OTHER ENVIRONMENTS " AND INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE , " EVEN IF THEY 'RE ONLY COMPUTER-GENERATED , THE PRESSURES OF THE MISSION- - " YEAH , YOU DON 'T HAVE TO READ THE WHOLE THING . " DIVISIONS WILL FORM AMONG THE CREW . " BARELY ACKNOWLEDGED ANIMOSITIES AND JEALOUSIES " WILL CROP UP . PARANOID AND EVEN DELUSIONAL BEHAVIOR IS POSSIBLE . " I KNOW WHAT I WROTE , FRANK . [ scoffs ] YOU 'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE . IN EVERY SENSE BUT THE PHYSICAL , BILLIE WAS RAPED . SHE 'S GONNA FEEL THE EMOTIONAL , PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THAT FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE . HOW IS SHE ? SHE 'S IN SHOCK . RIGHT . SHE 'S HANGING ON TO THE VIRTUAL NATURE OF THE EXPERIENCE AS A WAY OF SAYING IT WASN 'T REAL , THEREFORE NOTHING HAPPENED , AND SHE DOESN 'T NEED TREATMENT . WHAT DO YOU THINK ? WAS IT REAL ? WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME , FRANK ? I 'M ASKING IF YOU KNOW FANTASY FROM REALITY , ROGER . I THINK I DO . DO YOU KNOW WHAT 'S REAL , FRANK ? I 'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK . I THINK THIS MISSION HAS CHANGED . I THINK OUR EYES ARE ABOUT TO BE OPENED AND THAT--THAT- - THAT WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A PROFOUND AWAKENING THAT--THAT YOU AND I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE . AND I THINK THE VIRT MODULES ARE CRUCIAL TO THAT AWAKENING . I WON 'T SHUT THEM DOWN . IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION , YOUR BEHAVIOR OF LATE HAS BEEN ERRATIC AT BEST . ARE YOU SAYING THAT TO MISSION CONTROL ? I KNOW THE VALUE OF LOYALTY IN ANY ISOLATED CREW , FRANK , AND I LIVE ON THE SHIP TOO . WHAT 'S REALLY GOING ON ? I ONCE WAS LOST , BUT NOW I 'M FOUND . WAS BLIND , BUT NOW I SEE . LOOK , AT THE VERY LEAST , THE CREW DESERVE TO KNOW THE FACTS . THEY 'RE OUR FRIENDS AS WELL AS OUR COLLEAGUES . DON 'T LEAD THEM INTO TREACHEROUS WATERS UNAWARE , FRANK . YOU KNOW , ROGER , YOU 'RE RIGHT THERE . THEY DO DESERVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH . THE TRUTH SHALL SET THEM FREE . WHOO ! A SEXUAL ASSAULT ? COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC ? ASSAULT AGAINST WHO ? WELL , THERE 'S A PRIVACY ISSUE HERE . I 'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO DESCRIBE THE ATTACK IN DETAIL OR WHO EXPERIENCED IT . BUT IN MY OPINION , THERE IS A SERIOUS DEFECT IN THE VIRT SOFTWARE , AND I 'M STRONGLY RECOMMENDING THAT WE REFRAIN FROM USING THE VIRT MODULES . UH , FOR HOW LONG ? UNTIL WE KNOW THE PROBLEM 'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AND REPAIRED . CAN 'T WE JUST UPLOAD NEW SOFTWARE ? NOT AT THIS RANGE AND SPEED . WE 'RE LUCKY TO GET SIMPLE ENGINEERING PACKETS , LET ALONE COMPLEX SOFTWARE UPLOADS . I DON 'T THINK THERE 'S ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM THE VIRT MODULES . ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A PERMANENT SHUTDOWN ? POSSIBLY . WELL ... WE 'VE ALL EXPERIENCED COMPUTER GLITCHES BEFORE , AND JUST TO PLAY DEVIL 'S ADVOCATE HERE , ISN 'T IT POSSIBLE THAT WE 'RE OVERREACTING ? YOU HEARD HIM SAY " SEXUAL ASSAULT , " RIGHT ? [ sighs ] YES . WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY ? I MEAN , THERE 'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY GETTING A PINCH ON THE ASS AND BEING GANG-RAPED . SOMEONE WAS VIOLATED BY A COMPUTER PROGRAM . DOESN 'T MATTER WHAT IT MEANS EXACTLY . UM , FOR ONCE , I HAVE TO AGREE WITH JIMMY HERE . AND I DON 'T MEAN TO SOUND INSENSITIVE OR ANYTHING , BUT , UH , THESE PROGRAMS ARE THE ONLY CHANCE THAT ANY OF US HAVE FOR PRIVACY HERE ON THE SHIP . AND IF ALL WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SOME C.G. CHARACTER COPPING A FEEL , I DON 'T THINK IT 'S A- - WAIT , I 'M SORRY . WHAT KIND OF LOGIC IS THAT ? ONE OF THESE CHARACTERS SHOT ME , JULES . SORRY , IS MURDER A GRAY AREA FOR YOU TOO ? PEOPLE GET SHOT IN THEIR ACTION PROGRAMS ALL THE TIME . IT WASN 'T IN AN ACTION PROGRAM . I WAS RELAXING IN MY BEACH HOUSE . I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ALONE . AN INTRUDER CAME IN AND SHOT ME IN MY BED WHEN I WAS ALONE . SO YOU WERE SHOT , AND SOMEONE ELSE WAS ASSAULTED . IT 'S A SIMULATION . LOOK , JUST GO BACK IN , CREATE A COUPLE MACHINE GUNS , TAKE YOUR REVENGE . YOU 'LL FEEL BETTER , BELIEVE ME . LOOK , I 'M SORRY . I JUST DON 'T SEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS . NONE OF IT 'S REAL . IT 'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD . BRILLIANT , BRILLIANT . YOU AND I ARE GONNA REVISIT THIS . WELL , WE 'RE STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU , SKIPPER . GONNA SHUT DOWN THE MODULES OR NOT ? NO , I 'M NOT . KNOCK , KNOCK . WHAT ? CAN I COME IN ? YEAH . I 'M SORRY . THEY 'RE IDIOTS . I KNEW THAT . HOW OLD ARE YOU ? [ scoffs ] I 'M 24 . I WAS 24 WHEN I JOINED THE MARINES . AND I WAS ON , UH ... I WAS ON THIS TRAINING MISSION , AND TWO GUYS FROM MY OWN UNIT ... THEY , UM ... YOU KNOW , THESE GUYS- - I MEAN , I--I ATE WITH THEM . I RACKED WITH THEM . I--IT- - AND THAT WAS THE WORST PART , YOU KNOW ? JUST THE REALIZATION THAT NONE OF THAT MATTERED , THAT I DIDN 'T EVEN REALLY EXIST TO THEM . [ scoffs ] THAT 'S THE THING , YOU KNOW . LIKE , THESE GUYS- - THEY DON 'T GET IT , YOU KNOW . THEY DON 'T GET THAT- - THAT EVEN WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD , YOUR MIND IS WHERE IT HAPPENS , MORE THAN YOUR BODY . I MEAN , WHEN THAT 'S GOING ON , YOU 'RE NOT EVEN IN YOUR BODY . THEY 'VE ALREADY TAKEN THAT FROM YOU . THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IS YOU 'RE GONNA BE OKAY . DON 'T LISTEN TO THOSE ASSES TELLING YOU THAT IT 'S NOT REAL OR IT 'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD , AND SO IT DOESN 'T MATTER . JUST FEEL IT . YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ? YEAH . YOU ANY GOOD ? I 'M OKAY . YEAH , YOU ARE . SO WHAT WAS THAT CONVERSATION YOU HAD WITH FRANK YESTERDAY ? THERE 'S BEEN QUITE A LOT GOING ON WITH HIM . MM-HMM . YOU 'VE NOTICED IT TOO ? WELL , YEAH . [ laughs ] BUT QUICKLY , THE LAST FEW DAYS , ONE MINUTE , DEPRESSED , ANGRY AT THE--AT THE CREW . THAT 'S NOT LIKE HIM , REALLY . HE 'S VERY LEVEL . THE NEXT MINUTE , HE 'S UP . HE 'S COMPLETELY HIGH AS A KITE . JUST NOW WE SAW HIM . HE 'S ... [ sighs ] WELL , MAYBE HE 'S HAPPY . I DON 'T KNOW . MAYBE HE 'S HAPPY . I-I HOPE HE 'S HAPPY . SOMETHING MIGHT 'VE CHEERED HIM UP . [ sighs ] I DON 'T KNOW , BUT SOMETHING IS NOT ... QUITE RIGHT , AND I 'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT . ( Jean ) EXCUSE ME , COMMANDER . COMMANDER ? YES ? THERE 'S A CALL FROM JULES ON THE FLIGHT DECK . [ beeping ] WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE , BOSS . UH , WE RETRACTED THE COMM ARRAY SO WE COULD THOSE AIR-BRAKING TESTS , AND NOW IT WON 'T DEPLOY AGAIN . IT COULD BE A SERVO FAILURE . IT COULD BE A BLOWN POWER SUPPLY , BUT I 'VE DONE ALL I CAN FROM HERE . SOMEBODY 'S GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A WALK , CHECK IT OUT .

IT 'S NOT AS IF I 'M- - I 'M PRETENDING THAT YOU 'LL EVER READ THESE LETTERS . BUT , UM , I HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE ABOUT THIS , AND RIGHT NOW THERE JUST , UH , ISN 'T ANYONE ELSE . THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT TURNING BACK . HAVING PASSED GO / NO GO , WE 'RE COMMITTED TO THE MISSION . THERE WAS A BRIEF ARGUMENT ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE COMMANDER 'S DEATH . WHEN WE , UH , PULLED APART THE , UH , AIR-LOCK MECHANISM , WE FOUND A SHORT INSIDE ONE OF THE HYDRAULIC RELAYS- - A 20-CENT FUSE THAT MUST 'VE OVERLOADED . NOW , RIKA FELT THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO STUDY OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES , BUT DR. JOHNSON ... [ chuckles ] DR. JOHNSON , WHO WAS SECOND-IN-COMMAND , DECLARED IT AN ACCIDENT . SAID WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO MOVE ON , TRY AND PUT IT BEHIND US . WELL , AFTER THAT , WE ALL JUST TRIED TO GET BACK TO NORMAL . BUT WHAT 'S NORMAL ? YOU GOT TO ASK YOURSELF WHEN YOU 'RE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES FROM EARTH , AND YOU 'VE JUST LOST THE ONE MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO HOLD YOU ALL TOGETHER , AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE KNOWS . I KNOW EVERY INCH OF THIS SHIP , EVERY SYSTEM , EVERY SUBSYSTEM . AND I ALSO KNOW THIS ... THERE IS NO WAY THAT THAT OUTER AIR-LOCK DOOR COULD 'VE OPENED ON ITS OWN , NO MATTER HOW MANY RELAYS WERE SHORTED OUT . IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE . SOMEONE HAD TO DO SOMETHING DELIBERATE THAT CAUSED THAT DOOR TO OPEN ... WHICH MEANS THAT SOMEONE ON THIS SHIP IS A KILLER . AND BECAUSE I DON 'T KNOW WHO THAT IS ... I CAN 'T TRUST ANYONE . [ sighs ] [ beeping ] I LOVE YOU . [ beeping ] I LOVE YOU . [ beeping ] I LOVE YOU . I LOVE YOU . [ crying ] JEAN . ( Jean ) YES , RIKA . WHOSE HEADSET IS THAT ? ( Jean ) IT 'S COMMANDER PIKE 'S .

 Brock ! Aah ! Oh ! Ow ! Rusty ? Nobody move ! I 'll get it ! Colonel Fun has arrived ! Ah , you read my mind . I need a stiff one in me after that car ride . Why , was I too fast for you , Horace ? Never let a woman drive your Aston , Jonesie . This one handles a stick like it 's got herpes . Well , who knows , with all the strange garages you park it in . Hello , Dr. Venture . Ms. Quymn . More like , Ms. Bullocks-buster . If she won 't take my name ... maybe she 'll take a smack in her smart mouth . Try me . Mom , are you and Horace quarrelling again ? No , Tara . Oh , hello , Sunshine . Got your nose . Kano ! Take Tara downstairs , would you ? Go with the nice Chinaman , Tara , doll . Ahem . Where do we , you know ? H.E.L.P.eR. ! Oh , you pretty thing . Just a little further ... and we 'll reach the Lost City of Gold , Sabu . Save me , oh , save me , Dr. Venture ! Dr. Quymn , I presume ? Kano , we 're out of ice ! This time , I get to save you from the savages ! Dr. Quymn , I presume . Gently . I sucked the poison out ... but you were completely dehydrated . What were you thinking running about in the jungle in- - what is this , polyester ? " Humidity is no excuse for wrinkles , Rusty . " Pity your father also didn 't teach you not to steal ... fertility idols from irritable head-hunters . Oh , that . I 've been researching alternative cures for impotence . Oh , not for me , of course . Have you not tried Viagra ? It gives me- - my customers headaches , nausea , dyspepsia , and / or diarrhoea . But enough shop talk . How 've you been ? What are you doing way out here in the middle of nowhere ? Oh , you know , " curing cancer . " - Ah . - Well , I 'm trying , anyway . There 've been a number of ... obstacles . Mother , is your friend all right ? Yes , my darlings . Come and meet Dr. Venture . These are my daughters , Nancy and Drew . - Hello , Dr. Venture . - Pleased to meet you , sir . Ah , hello , ladies , hello . So , children . The father must be- - I 'm back . Finally caught that son of a bitch ... who 's been sniffing around the campsite . Big mo-fo , too . Ew ! Oh ! Rusty , this is Ginny ... my bodyguard and " right-hand man , " as it were . Oh , hello . I 'm Dr. V- - Ginny 's a yank . Just like you . Not like him . Ungh ! Well , really should be getti- - Oh , my god ! I 'll just carry them . Oh , poo . Are you sure you can 't stay just a while longer , Rusty ? - Yes , won 't you ? - Oh , do stay ! - They remind me of my boys . - Please , pretty please ! They get really excited about everything , too . Bang , Clyde . Aw . Hey , enough with that already , Hank . We 're supposed to teach him boxing , not tricks . - You ready , Dean ? - No . Brock , this is kind of the saddest thing ever . - Bang , Clyde . - Stop it , Hank . Yeah , it is , Dean . But your pop says we need the money , OK ? Now , fight ! Bang , Clyde . Ow ! Clyde ! Freeze , poachers ! Whoa , easy , lady . Wait , don 't ! They 're with me ! Your fancy new pal 's got a nice little side line ... selling apes on the black market , Tara . - Oh , Rusty , really ? - No ! - No , this isn 't how it looks . - Yeah , it is . Mummy . What 's going on ? Who are they ? We were in Thailand just last week ... and we came across this tragic little fella in a cage . Terrible , terrible ... Hank ? Hank ? Do you feel cold ? Is your skin tingling ? ... and so we had to rescue the little guy . Rigor . First symptoms of malaria , I think . ... reintroduce him to the wild . Slowly . In fact , hell , he looks ready to me . What do you think , Brock ? Huh ? Uh-huh . Oh , oh , yeah , sure . Sure , Dr. Venture . See , feral instincts taking over already . He 's cured ! Yeah , we had a bit of a fling years ago . Ah , she 's one of those bleeding hearts , save-the-world types . So , no more teaching chimps to box , huh ? By the way , thanks for that new personal low . I like to mix it up , keep you on your toes . Speaking of which , new mission . Operation " Do Rusty a Solid . " I need you to keep this Jimmy character distracted . - Who ? - The bodyguard , what 's his name . - Who , Ginny ? - Yeah , him . So , you two are identical twins ? Semi-identical , technically . We just look lots alike . Our own mum can 't tell us apart sometimes . My dad 's the same way with us . Say , what do you gals do for fun ? Oh , well , back home we usually like to solve mysteries . Hey , me , too . I 'm more the adventuring type . Oh , we go on adventures , as well ! Fight mummies ... You know how it is , mystery leads to museum ... museum leads to mummy ... and Bob 's your uncle , there we are , right in the thick of it . I can bench-press . I think he 's kind of got a thing for her ... and , well , frankly , he 's a bit of a wet blanket . The only wet blankets I 'm interested in are the ones- - All right , I know where this is going . You know , when we 're sweating- - - Yes ! - Rolling around . - Yes ! - When we 're having- - OK , Doc , I get it ! All right . Just making sure we 're all on the same page here . Sex . Son of a friggin ' bitch ! Stay close . Natives are real suspicious of outsiders ... ever since that IKEA opened up downriver . The logging company that supplies the lumber ... for their Billy bookcases has been trying ... to force them off their ancestral lands . He says it struck again last night . The Were-o-dile . Were-o-dile ? ! Local folk legend . Half man , half crocodile . And covered in awful hair . He says it tore the head off their mightiest warrior . He says it was as if someone shook up a six-foot can of ... blood soda ... and somebody popped the top . Poosh ! By day , it 's an ordinary person . But when the moon is full and the Were-o-dile 's spirit ... is displeased , it seeks vengeance upon the tribe . He says it 's your fault ... that you brought the wrath of the Were-o-dile ... when you stole their idol . Nice . Oh , it 's a sweetheart deal all around . We don 't even have to flip a coin , ' cause they 're identical . Semi-identical . Means they 're monozygotic but developed different . Listen to the lady-killer on this one . You have got to super-stop it with that egghead crud . Drew 's got a freckle on her nose . So , you can tell them apart . Frith help us . Play it cool , Dean-o . Step to them with that line , they 'll think ... you 're some some crazy obsessed weirdo stalker who , like ... draws pictures of them in your notebook . They 're for the Venture Home news . Pictures increase circulation . And they 'll think you , like , talk to the pictures . And then you cut out the lips and the eyes with , like , a razor blade ... and then you write dirty words on them with your own poop ... and you rub them on your chest . What- - where did- - C.S.I. Well , I 'm not interested in playing it anything . I like them . I just don 't like them like them . - Well , I do . - Which one ? I don 't know . Either one . Whatever . I like Dean . He 's got that hot little Iggy Pop body but with , like ... a Weezer sort of style . You little scammer-jammer ! I told you I like Dean ! - Go for Hank . - Ew , no . I don 't like Hank at all . I find him boorish . You two just keep clear of those boys . You can have all your prissy little adventures ... or whatever with them . But if I catch y 'all getting too adventurous ... I 'm gonna tan your hides . Capiche ? Yes , ma 'am . Now , come here , you buttons ! Virginia , why do you hate men so much ? I don 't hate men , princess . I just never met a real one . - Well , ain 't you a pretty one ? - Huh ? Oh , hey . Brock Samson . We weren 't properly introduced . Virginia Donne . How 's it hanging ? Oh , oh , tough guy , huh ? What do you drive ? '69 Charger . Pfft , penis substitute . Of course , all them horsies under the hood ain 't worth ... a damn in this rugged terrain without all-wheel drive . Solid chassis , pliant suspension , torque . Look , uh ... Whew . Hot in the jungle , huh ? Uh , yeah . Yes , it is . Yes , it is . Moist heat grips you like a vice . Maybe go for a nice dip in the river ? Skinny-dip ? Um , yeah , maybe . I 'll do that . Ho-ho , ease off the gas , there , Mustang Sally . Where I live , we drive on the other side of the road . What the hell ? Yes . Ahh . Wowza . Sex . Ahh . Down ... now . Oh , Rusty , you really should quit smoking . Don 't ... smoke . Then you really need to get more exercise . Brock ... second-hand ... killing me . Well , you can 't tell me this view wasn 't worth the climb . But I want to show you something even more special . God ... yes . This is the entire reason I 'm here . It 's called Solomon 's heart . This valley is the only place on Earth it can grow . But they only blossom on mature trees , over 40 years old . You see how the seeds form a heart ? - I do . - Now you know why ... it 's so desperately important we protect this rainforest . Because hearts ... Because these seeds contain the antigens ... that can cure cancer , and who knows what else ! - Loneliness ? - With further research , I- - Did you say- - - Ow . - Oh , let me . I 'm sorry . We should go . It 's getting dark , and I don 't want to- - - But I want to . - I don 't want to get hurt . You won 't . That felt good , didn 't it ? It 's not a good time . We have to get back to camp before moonrise . I 'm sorry . Wait a minute . Wait , how do I- - - Oh , my god ! - You 're the Were-o-dile ! I 'm not the Were-o-dile ! You 're the Were-o-dile ! How could you ? ! You 're my brother ! We 're twins ! That means I 'm a Were-o-dile , too ! Oh , no ! That- - that doesn 't really follow . I mean , we have different hair . And I have a huskier build , let 's admit it . Plus , I barely have hair under there . Me , too . Not for lack of trying . Run away ! I got him . It was a close call , but I got him . God , frigging harness buckle is digging into my back . - Is he dead ? - He looks dead . He was upside-down for a while . Blood probably rushed to his ... - Ugh . - Ugh . Who did that to pop ? ! Was it the Were-o-dile ? Did you see him , Brock ? No , I saw them . - Two of them . - Two of them ? Mummy ? What 's going on ? Girls , thank god ! Are you OK ? We 're fine . What 's going on ? You 're in shock . We got to get you warm . All right , no more screwing around ! This camp is officially on full Were-o-dile alert ! Everyone in their bunks now , come on ! Chop-chop ! Hey , your own bunks , dick . Supercuts , you take first watch . I want them out of here . They 're bringing bad juju to this place . Really , Ginny ? You know as well as I this ridiculous Were-o-dile ... is probably just some logging company stooge ... trying to put the scare into us . Ask Rusty . He was a boy adventurer . I 'm not asking him squat . I don 't like him . That 's unfortunate , because I plan to ask Dr. Venture ... to be my lab assistant . Oh , no , not that . Oh , Ginny , if I didn 't know better , I 'd think you were jealous . Don 't you worry . I could never replace you . But I have needs you simply aren 't capable of fulfilling , Ginny . If you 'd just give it a chance , Tara Bear , I can be- - Dr. Venture is a trained scientist . He can help me in ways you never could . Yeah , like out of your shorts . Virginia ! You forget your place . My place ? My place is watching out for your asses . Kindly remove your things ... from this hut and find lodging elsewhere . No , you kindly remember this , little miss fancy britches . Just ' cause mommy and daddy didn 't love you enough ... doesn 't mean I 'm gonna clean up after you ... every time you let a man make a mess of your life ! Get out ! Get out ! You monster ! I know what you really are , Tara ! Quit staring at my ass , Samson ! No means no ! Now get to your post . Stay calm . Stay calm . Don 't let the demon out . Curiouser and curiouser . Dr. Quymn has a demon she 's afraid to let out . Yet she calls Ginny a monster . And both of them were in the woods ... when Brock saw the Were-o-diles . But where were Nancy and Drew that whole time ? In their hut ? Perhaps . Then again , perhaps not ! One thing is certain , however . Someone or someones in this camp is the Were-o-dile ! And we 're gonna get to the bottom of- - Hank ... are you listening to me ? Actually , can you keep it down ? I 'm trying to write a song for the girls . Will you get with the program ? We 've got a mystery to solve . Then we should team up with the girls . We can 't ! They 're- - they 're suspects . Then solve it tomorrow or something . Man , what 's your hurry ? What 's your slow-ey ? You 've gone soft on me , Henry Allen so-called Venture ! You used to be all , " go , Team Venture ! " But now- - now you 're all , " go , team ... " B-boobies ! " Gosh ! The natives are getting restless . We 're not long for this world . Then before they kill us and shrink our heads ... and cut us up and eat us , kiss me , Dr. Venture . That 's it . Oh , yes , I 'm having the time of my life ! Aah ! Rusty ? Would you like to come and play in my jungle fort ? Ready , Drew ? Ready , Freddie , Nancy Fancy . Hey , Hank . You 're supposed to stay in your- - - Hey , Brock . - Oh , hey , it 's Dean . Well , looks like it 's up to me and you ... to solve the mystery of the Were-o-dile . Everyone else has dumb girls on the brain . All right , you big Nebraskan oak . Don 't make me regret this . You , too , Brock ? ! You , too ? ! The both of youse got jungle fever ! The both of youse . Screw this . Mood 's totally blown . Huh ? Ah . " Meet me in the clearing in 1 0 minutes . " Hank ? - Yeah ? - Hank ! Find some dynamite and a big cargo net ... and meet me behind the camp in 1 0 minutes- - 1 0 ! - But- - - No buts ! Do it ! The mystery is afoot . Shh , it 's me . Why are you walking through the jungle backwards ? I - I - I don 't know . Look , I 'd love to chat , but I really can 't , ' cause- - aah ! Shh , it 's me . And we 've solved the mystery of the Were-o-dile . - You have ? Well who- - - Not here . Come back to our hut . We 'll show you everything . But Hank ... A storm is coming . Can smell it . Hard rain 's gonna fall . Hard rain . Whoa ! Think I just found my cure for impotence after all . Now , if I could just find a way to bottle that ass ... I 'd be a multimillionaire . Here , have some of this . What 's- - It 's a native potion to ward off the Were-o-dile . Where 's Hank ? He said he 'd be here . Don 't worry . He won 't bother us . Just relax . And we 'll show you everything . Oh , wow . OK , OK . Oh , Rusty , you 've no idea how long it 's been . 1 9 years , 2 months and 4 days . W-w-wait ! Why- - whoa , what are you ... Please , we have to stop ... Aah ! Help ! Oh , this isn 't happening ! Help ! Just enjoy this . Oh , my god ! You 're the Were-o-diles ! Help ! Get your filthy mitts off of her ! What was that ? Ginny , what are you do- - I 'm not gonna let him break your heart again ! I 'm not gonna let you put your seed in her ... and walk out that door again ! Brock , Brock ! Ow ! Brock ! Oh , bodyguard , bodyguard , anyone ? She 's not the same liquored-up little teenage ... rich girl that you- - What teenager ? I haven 't seen her since I was 1 0 ! She doesn 't need your pills or your booze ... or your shock therapy anymore ! I fixed her , not you ! I did ! Me , me , me , me ! Oh , I see how it is . - Damn , you 're strong . - Bring it on ! Try it again , asshole ! Damn , you 're strong for a crazy old bitch ! She can fight ! You 're acting ... Dr. Quymn is the Were-o-dile ! She 's- - Oh , my god , I almost fucked a Were-o-dile . We have to stop her transformation before she kills us all ! The power of Christ compels you ! Stop it , you little asshole ! She 's not a Were-o-dile ! She 's an epileptic ! Ew ! OK , OK . You 're OK , Tara Bear . You 're with Ginny now . You 've come a long way , baby . Where 's my amulet ? Oh , geez , OK . Just this once . Any- - anybody got a light for her ? Ah , ladies . Fashionably late , I see . Hey . We never even believed ... there was an actual Were-o-dile . I mean , it 's preposterous . And we certainly didn 't mean for Hank to get hurt . Tell your brother he 's a real hero for what he did . The natives already did . They even made him an honorary warrior ... and gave him a circumcision . - Oh . - Hmm . Does that mean you aren 't ... Ew . Don 't talk to him , girls . Ginny , darling ! Come along ! We 're going ! Hey . How you holding up there , broken arrow ? Can I get you anything ? I could use a cocoa . Do we have any cocoa ? Or something stronger ? I just don 't want to feel anything anymore , Brock . Oh , god .

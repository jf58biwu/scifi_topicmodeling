 Previously on Heroes . Now that Danko has thrown Nathan off a building and watched him fly away , it all comes down to you , Noah . Danko doesn 't trust me . Tell me you didn 't know about this . Then make him trust you . They lost Angela Petrelli . I guess someone tipped her . Or she saw them coming . She does that , you know . I 'm walking a fine line here . Claire , I 've given you a free pass . I just dance away to college , pretend everything is all hunky-dory ? Claire ! Actually , he 's my biological padre . So , what 's the plan ? The plan is to keep you safe . I was exposed , so that free pass I had for you went away . But even Danko 's reach doesn 't extend south of the border . Yet . And what about everyone else ? I 'll make some calls , put some things in motion . All right , well , we also gotta eat . There 's a cantina down the way . Can I buy you a taco ? With what money ? I 'll think of something . I think I 'm just gonna go for a walk . Now look , it 's probably best that we stick together , okay ? It 's for your own safety . I 'll be careful , I promise . All right , look , I 'll meet you at the cantina , okay ? Don 't be ... I think we 're clear . My very own guardian angel . You 're a good son , Peter . That 's not why I saved you . I want answers . And you think I 've got them ? You always know more than you let on . I 'm sorry to disappoint you . But I need to find some answers for myself right now . What ? That 's why I had you bring me here . This is where I 'm supposed to be . So , tell me exactly what happened . We were moving in to apprehend this guy . Agents Whitman , Price and Holiday went in , I watched the hallway . Then I heard three gunshots . I ran in as fast as I could and I found them like this . And you didn 't see anyone ? No , sir . Nothing . I 'm sorry , sir . Go back to HQ . Get cleaned up . What are you thinking ? No sign of a scuffle . One bullet each in the back . Who was their intended target ? James Martin . 32 . High-school geometry teacher . Amateur fly-fisherman . Bio doesn 't exactly read " trained assassin . " What 's Martin 's ability ? Unknown . His DNA was in the national database . Set off a red flag . We 're doing that now ? You gonna lecture me about civil liberties ? No , about sending your men in blind . Unknown means Martin could be anything . He could be a telepath , a teleporter , an invisible man . Each one requires a different tactic . Our orders say to take them all in . You 're so desperate to chalk up a win , you 're cutting corners , is that it ? Let 's not forget you 're Nathan Petrelli 's boy . Your last crusade was to catch this rebel , and you didn 't catch him , did you ? You need a win a hell of a lot more than I do . As I walk along I wonder what went wrong With our love A love that was so strong I love this song . Oh , quite a bloodbath in there , isn 't it ? Did you get my gifts ? The taxidermied bunny and the near-dead puppeteer ? You shouldn 't have . It 's an overture toward collaboration , since we both want the same thing . And what 's that , again ? Killing people like me . I think we should pool our resources . What 's in it for you ? Let 's just say you fascinate me . And you 're in way over your head in there . I can help you . If you want . I can find the guy who killed your agents . I 'm a-walkin ' in the rain Tears are fallin ' and I feel the pain I want eyes on every road . Every terminal . Air . Bus . Roadblocks . This isn 't a drill , people . Three of our own died , and they will not die in vain . Not on my watch . Not on yours . So remember your training . Remember Agents Whitman , Price and Holiday and their families . And remember , we don 't sleep until this son of a bitch is caught . Any questions ? Nice speech . We need to win . You 've had 20 years of experience with these people . And I need a plan . And I don 't want to hear " One of us , one of them . " Then I won 't say it . But it got the job done . The very same tactics that you used on all of those counter-insurgency programs you ran from Havana to Kabul . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , right , okay . Well , if you did know what I was talking about , then you would understand the value of co-opting the native population . Working the enemy . A little focused manipulation goes a long way . How could you work with these people ? Trust them ? Who said anything about trust ? They 're assets . Weapons to be mobilized . Motivate them . Greed , revenge , love , hate , whatever it takes to make the collar . Speaking of which ... I have reason to believe that Sylar is here , in D.C. This could be the win that we both need . Or it could be another chapter in the big book of you letting him slip through your fingers . No , I got another assignment for you . Voil√† . Where 'd you get that ? I sold my kidney . Actually , both of them . Twice . I found a pawnshop down the street . I sold the necklace my dad gave me . My other dad . You didn 't have to do that . I didn 't want to , but he 's Mister Survival Skills . And if he knew we were in a pinch and I didn 't sell it , he 'd be mad . I expect he would . It 's a nice gesture , but I got everything under control . This isn 't exactly a simple situation here . It seems simple to me . Government agents are out there , hunting innocent people . And they 're gonna keep going until you tell them to stop what you started . Would it kill you to show me just a little bit of gratitude ? For what ? For what ? For giving you a free pass . For risking my neck to save your life when it was over . Pick one . Either one . Just common courtesy , Claire . Why did you give me a free pass ? I had my reasons . I 'll be back . What are you gonna do with it ? Turn it into more . Gentlemen , is that tequila ? The Mass is ended . May you go forth in peace and love , and serve the Lord . You think sanctuary 's gonna stop agents from coming ? I can 't sleep , Peter . To find where we should go , what we should do , I need to dream , and to dream , I need to sleep . And I can 't . I haven 't . Not for a long time . Take a pill . Doesn 't work . For the dreams to come , the ones that matter , sleep has to be natural . It has to be earned . Earned ? I always found peace here . Your father and I were married in this church . We walked down this aisle . Your first communion . Even Nana 's funeral . You 're probably too young to remember , but you held my hand . There used to be love in this family once . Look at us now . It 's all my fault . You 've come here to be forgiven ? I 'm not sure even God has that in him . You boys wanna make this a little more interesting ? What do you have in mind ? Listen , just come on ... $ 100 a head . Last man standing takes it all . Listen , I can do this . I used to do this , scraping for shore leave money in the Philippines , all right ? I 'm good at it . Fine . Go for it . All right . All right , boys . Line them up . In a line . You know where we 're going . Jenkins . Sir . I wanted to check in . See if there was anything else I can do . No . Just try and get some rest . I wanted to tell you that what you said earlier , about the guys ... It was inspirational . I wish I had your strength . Hello ? Special delivery . How the hell did you get in here ? Well , you 'd be amazed at what you can do with a lifted ID badge , a $ 4 tie and a West Baltimore accent . But you 've got much bigger problems . I 've done some homework about that killer of yours . I don 't need your help . Well , I just found some evidence to the contrary . There 's another body . He stashed it . You missed it . I found it , of course . You 're lying . Look in the box . And what 's in the box ? Your answer . How James Martin was able to shoot your men in the back so easily . It 's because of what he can do . He 's a shape-shifter . Where is he ? Just around the northeast corner . Excuse me . Hey , hey , hey . I didn 't do anything . Take him in . Your coat 's sopping wet . I found this one in the bins , it looked like something you 'd wear . It should . It 's mine . I made a donation last week . It 's supposed to go to someone who needs it . You need it . Come on . Didn 't know you were still so active . I give them things . Not devotion . Not myself . Not the same . It 's like with you and your brother . Your father and I supported you . But we didn 't give you support . Sure you did . Oh , Peter . There were times when you were growing up , you were so confused . You were so desperate for answers , and I could 've told you the truth . I could 've given you comfort . I didn 't . You must hate me . I 'll find you a cup of tea . It 'll help you sleep . I don 't hate you . Look , whatever 's happened , you 're still my mother . I 'm afraid that unconditional love isn 't really love at all . Hey , why don 't we just call it a draw ? You guys don 't look so good . Nonsense . You don 't have to do this , you know . Yeah , I do . We need the money , don 't we ? Besides , your dad 's not the only one who can ... Your other dad . He 's not the only one who can do stuff , you know ? You better get your old man off to bed . No . We need a rematch . Huh ? How about a rematch ? No , man . I beat him fair and square . Come on , what about winning a little bit more ? What did you have in mind ? What about this watch ? It 's a pretty nice watch , huh ? It 's a really nice watch , but I 'm like 22 shots deep . And you 're a little bit late to the party . Well , better catch up , huh ? You 're not the only one who can get the drop on someone . You 've been waiting here for me ? Your M.O. is predictable enough . You desperately want to find Martin so you can get that ability , don 't you ? I have plenty of powers . Yeah , but this is different . Shape-shifting . You 're salivating . I read your profile . How you like to take on accents , affectations . Play characters . It 's fun . It 's sad . You 're so desperate to be someone else , you want out . You have no idea what I want . Shape-shifting , it 's your escape hatch . 'Course , I could save you the trouble , end it all for you right now . The part of my brain that you 'll need to hit to kill me is microscopic . I 'm a pretty good shot . It 's not that simple . I also gotta jam something in there , right ? To make it stick . Well ... You 've clearly thought all of this through , haven 't you ? Except for the part where you can 't catch your guy without my help . You 're all the win I need . The white whale . Maybe I 'm the goose who lays the golden egg . I can round them all up . You 're suggesting that I can 't ? You chased a shape-shifter . You don 't chase a shape-shifter . I 'm just one photo on that board . Just one . But I could help you find them all . Then you can take your shot . I asked to be extraordinary . And I promised I 'd make the world a better place . So when I got my chance , I lived up to my end of the bargain . For what ? I 'm running for my life . A lot of people are running for their lives . They 're hurt and they 're dying . And I can 't help them . Do you even care what you put people through ? When they kneel here , before you , and they ask for help , do you even listen ? And I 'm tired of fighting . And I 'm angry . I 'm angry at my father , Nathan . At my mother . At you . We had a deal . I think it 's about time you lived up to your end . Please , just ... Show up . Right , I 'll check the back . I want the perimeter locked down . A team , rip apart the rectory . Excuse me . What do you people think you 're doing ? Sit down , sir . Sir , we have reason to believe the church is harboring two fugitives . Chain the doors . No one gets in or out , you understand ? Yes , sir . This is a waste of time . Martin 's halfway across the country by now . No , he 's not . He hasn 't left the city . He had his chance and he didn 't take it . He showed up as Agent Jenkins , right under your nose . Yeah , why would he do that ? Martin 's only human . We all crave routine . We just need to find his . You got some special power for that ? I do . But I don 't need it . You can tell everything about a person from their belongings . I thought you 'd be better at this . Why 's that ? Because you 're a shape-shifter , too . I 've been to your apartment . You 've got no books , no art , no keepsakes , no correspondence . Nothing to define you . This is the part where you get under my skin . That 's in your file , too . It must be very hollow . Boring . Not like Martin 's closet . I 've never seen so many costumes . There 's not much call for a geometry teacher to wear an Armani suit . Or scrubs . Or this . It 's fractured , disjointed . He 's trying on personalities like clothes . Has he made a choice ? Not yet . Like all of us , he 's still looking . What 's the common denominator here ? Lawyer . Doctor . Priest . Power . These roles give Martin something he could never find in real life . Why ? Why does anybody want power ? To screw with people or to simply screw people ? Here . Tell me what you notice about all those pictures ? Martin isn 't in any of them . Or these are all Martin . Different men of power with different women of allure . It 's a clich√© for a reason . And it 's Martin 's routine . But where is he ? Where he goes every night . Looking to fall in love . Jeez . What do you weigh , like a buck 10 ? That 's none of your business . I 'm just saying , man , you just don 't even look drunk . I think that you 're just jealous that I caught up . Yeah , after I put your old man to sleep . Oh , please , that 's not hard . He tends to bite off more than he can chew . He 's pretty slick , but he seems like a good guy . He wants to be . Free passes and swooping in and taking me off to Mexico , thinking that 's all he has to do ... I get it . My parents are divorced , too . No . It 's not like that . Maybe it is . I just wish he would take off his armor , shining or otherwise , and just act like a normal human being . Oh , hell . Thank you . We need to go . Hey , come on . We gotta go . I won the money . Right through that door . All right , I 'll get it . You got it ? Yeah , I 'm checking every one . I 'm sorry , Peter . Mom , you need to be quiet . No , this may be our last chance together , and there are things I have to say . You don 't have to say anything , it 's okay . Shh ! Listen to me . I was just like you . My head in the clouds , full of hope . I was gonna be a teacher . And then my power manifested , and the dreams came . Visions of a bloody future . Of deceit and death . The apocalypse . And when I awoke , I tried to warn everyone . But no one would listen . Why would they ? Why should they ? I was Cassandra , screaming that the sky was falling , but when they looked up there wasn 't a cloud in sight . And I did it with lies , and with manipulation and betrayal . And it cost me everything , my friends , my husband , my boys . Mom . But , Peter , it 's the price I chose to pay to save the world . All clear . Let 's go . All right , you heard him . Back out . - We 're moving outside ? - Yes , sir . Guess who 's here ? Where ? Which one ? I suppose that fits the pattern , a position of power , authority , significance . I think you 'll recognize him . Remember what happened last time you chased him . What 's he up to ? Why me ? He 's after power . He thinks that 's something you have . He 's trying to convert the power into love . He 's doing a pretty good job of it , too . He 's a better you than you . Where did he go ? Okay . You should never , ever , fly in that condition . How are you not ... Ah . The whole tissue regeneration thing , I think it includes my liver tissue . Oh , yeah ? I didn 't know that . I 'm so sorry , Claire . Let me help , okay ? Oh , man . Whoa , okay . I really messed up . It 's all right . It 's fine . It 's not fine . You know what I did when I found out about you ? I did what I always do . I denied there was a problem . Just like I 'm doing right now . You know , we should probably have this conversation in the morning . The truth is , Claire , I get a pit in my stomach every time I think of you . It was just so stupid , the way I handled it . You know , I thought if I kept my distance , when the time was right , we would ... Catch up . But look at you . I sort of missed my chance , you 're all grown up . Hardly . You wanna know why I gave you a free pass ? Because I thought in one move , I could win you over . Wait a minute . Look at me right now . I 'm using you as an excuse to hide behind this mess that I ... You know what ? I know everybody 's counting on me to fix it . And I wanna try . I 'm gonna do it for everybody . Peter , my mom . For you . I 'll fix it all . I 'll make it all ... I lost him . Me , too . I guess he 's gone . For good this time . Let 's go . You killed him . No . He 's still alive . Oh , God . Wait . Can you do it without leaving ... Oh , no . No . Oh , God ! No , no ! Good morning . Morning . You really bailed me out with those kids last night , I appreciate it . That 's what family 's for , right ? So what 's the plan ? Are we going straight to Washington ? No . Look , I didn 't make any calls to anybody . I don 't really have any friends on the Hill at the moment . But last night you said that you would fix everything . I was drunk . I 'm sorry if I got your hopes up . There 's gotta be something that you can do . I 'm wide open if you got any ideas . Claire , I overreached , I screwed up , and now it 's just way beyond my control . Some things are bigger than one man . You know what ? Over the years I couldn 't help but think about my real dad . Who you were , what you looked like , your job . And then I met you . And you were more amazing than anything I could have ever imagined . Honey , that 's just a fantasy . No . No , it doesn 't have to be . You can do anything you want . You can fly . Claire . You 're supposed to be Superman . You feeling better ? I slept and I had a dream . What about ? That . Or should I say , her ? I know what we have to do now . First , we need to go find Nathan and Claire . We need to bring this family together . And then we need to go visit my sister . Sister ? So where you headed , anyway ? There 's a quarter-past-ocho to San Diego . What time is it ? I got nothing . What happened to your watch ? I 'm heading back up , you know . Good . Coming ? You okay , sir ? Those things will kill you . So how did that feel ? Zipping up that body bag ? Cathartic . Poetic . And tactically fortunate . It 'll be a lot easier for us to operate if everybody thinks I 'm dead . If we do this , if we succeed , you 'd be the only one left . Funny how that works .

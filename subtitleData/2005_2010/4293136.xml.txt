 Bionic Woman Season 01 Episode 05 You all right , soldier ? You need a doctor ? Easy , soldier . It 'll be all right . Just ... just put that gun down . What about Jeremy , the one from the bar ? Married . Not happily . You 're in a good mood tonight . I 'm always in a good mood . Honey , you have been walking around miserable all week . Seriously , what 's going on with you ? It 's like the weight of the world 's on you lately . That 's what margaritas are for . What about my brother ? Uh , no . Why not ? Because honestly , Robin , he 's gay . He is not ! Look , it 's fine , just stop trying to set him up with your girlfriends . You guys are so cynical . Besides , i don 't need a man in my life right now . Yes , you do . Honey , it 's almost winter . Every day is precious . Trust me , i don 't need a man to make me happy . That is really sad . Pathetic . Yeah , ditto . Oh , my god . Girls , look at this . Names of the victims will be released after the families have been notified . This is a stunning and tragic event . The soldier was a P.O.W. Held captive and feared dead for two months . He was set to ship home later this week . Hello . We have a situation . What is it ? It 's supposed to be a treatment for depression . I feel better already . It has to be implanted in your brain . But this particular neural implant has some side-effects . Okay , three american soldiers , all P.O.W. Held by an Al-qaeda cell , all released . All suddenly make very specific attacks on their own men . They 're like human car bombs . They all had this neural implant ? Yeah , we don 't know what it does , but ... We know where it comes from . Professor Howard Samuels . He runs the country 's most cutting-edge lab developing these things at Stanwick university . How about we start by arresting Samuels ? We 're not cops . Antonio 's gonna go after the buyer , and you 're going after the implants . So what , i break into the lab ? It 's not that simple . What 's this ? Student ID You 're going to college . You 're transferring in from England . How 's your british accent ? Okay , these are the basic classes you would 've had taken as a transfer student in neurobiology . Cellular neuroscience , which is just about how neurons process physiological and electrochemical signals . Glad that 's all it 's about . Systems neuroscience , which is just about how neurons , you know , form circuits ... can you just stop saying " which is just about ? " This is an insane amount of information to process this quickly . You just have to pull up that harvard part of your brain . The part that never went to harvard is much bigger . Besides , i was gonna major in irish literature . Wow , then you dodged a bullet when you didn 't go , because you would 've ended up a hundred grand in debt and still a bartender . Science , Jaime . That 's what pays the bills . I 'm gonna look like a total idiot . You can 't fake math and science . Okay , okay , okay , just calm down . Going to college was a fantasy for me . But in my fantasy , i 'm hanging out with intellectual people , tossing a frisbee around , making a nice pot of earl grey , and finishing my dissertation on James Joyce . Wow , we have very little in common . And now i 'm gonna look like a total idiot faking my way through cellular neuron science physio ... yeah , neuroscience . Yeah , Yeah . Uh-huh . You could wear glasses . Then you would look smarter . Thank you , Nathan , for that completely unhelpful suggestion . Just doing my job . Thank you , Nathan . You 're welcome ! Starting with the primary somatosensory cortex , we have areas one , two , and three defined by the medial longitudinal fissure , central and lateral sulcus . This region receives the majority ... young lady , you are new ? Sorry . Sorry . Yes , i , um ... I just transferred in from Oxford . Clarissa Whyte . I presume English is your first language . Yes . Then perhaps you can tell me what that sign says . No cell phones . Well , come on , a little conviction in your voice . Try again . No cell phones . That is so much better . Now you 're on a roll , perhaps you can tell me when my lecture 's interrupted by students who can 't remember to turn off their cell phones , what area of my brain is firing like crazy ? Um , well , that would be ... i 'll give you a hint . It 's the region that processes emotions like irritation . If that doesn 't help , it 's bordered by the inferior and middle temporal area . Um , that would be Brodmann area 38 , also known as the Polar Gyrus . Yes , that is correct . Keep your cell phone off in my classroom . How about this ? Faraj habib . I 'd say if he weren 't in Guantanamo right now he 'd be our guy . Nadeem Samad ? I like him for this . Well , he has no known ties to any terrorist organization . He has no criminal record . He graduated college with honors . He started obsessively visiting terrorist web sites 14 months ago . I 'm on web sites all the time . You 're doing research . Maybe he was too , doing a paper in college . He took two classes with Professor Samuels and became a practicing muslim all in the same time period . Ruth , this is racial profiling . Or brilliant detective work . Check him out . Hey . Aoki ! Oy ! Every time you crumple that paper , it makes me want to kill myself . That 's what my last roommate did . Great . It was great . I got all " a " s for the semester . You 're kidding . Yes . What are you working on ? Neuroscience lab work . Really ? I love that class . Easy " A " . Of course you did . What are you working on ? I have a paper on James Joyce due . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . The dead . I don 't even understand what it 's about . It 's all , like , irish and stupid and nothing happens ... no , it 's a great book . It 's all from the husband 's point of view the whole time , until the end of the book , when his wife tells a story about her first love . And the husband , who 's been so loving towards his wife all evening , realizes she wasn 't even thinking about him . She was thinking about her first love , who 's dead . It 's about how you can 't escape . Like somebody dies , and you think you 're free , but you 're not . The dead are always there . Which is a different ending to ulysses , which is all about love , and life , and sex , and optimism ... okay . You want to - you want to just do it for me ? You want to do my lab work ? Deal . Deal , give me one of these chocolate bars . There 's a ... there 's a party later , if you want to go with me . So do you know lots of people here ? Eh , a few . Ooh , there 's food here . Yeah , okay . Hey , the transfer student from Oxford . The merciful T.A. Tom gilchrist . Clarissa . Nice to meet you . Thank you so much for earlier . I totally blanked . Well , samuels can be intimidating . Yeah , he is a little ... he 's a mean , mean cranky old man . Yes , he is . But you 're very nice to take pity on me . Um , can i interest you in a tasty beverage ? A tasty beverage . Who ... step off . Who is this guy ? You know what they say about the brits . We love our drinks . Go away ! He 's trying to get you drunk . Can 't you see that ? Vodka , wine ? Uh , wine . ( tom so you must be lonely being so far away from home . Actually , no , it 's quite exciting being in america and all . I feel like felicity . Only she wasn 't from england , and she wasn 't a scientist , and she went to college to look for a guy , which i didn 't , so ... I don 't feel like felicity at all . I don 't know what i 'm saying . Can you talk now ? I kind of like listening to you free associate . I feel a little discombobulated . Jet lag . How about you ? How long have you been samuels ' t . A ? Oh , just this semester . It 's too bad he 's such a bastard , because he really is brilliant . He 's ... Doing work that 's going to make a difference . It 's his work in neural imaging research that made me want to become his T.A. My ... My dad ... Died of parkinson 's last year . I 'm so sorry . Aw , oh , yeah ? Oh , god , the oldest trick in the book , sommers . Answer the phone ! But after he was diagnosed , it was a wake up call . Before that , i was a bit of a screw-up . Almost dropped out of college . You 'd never know it . Well , now ... I want to be a neurosurgeon . - Neurosurgeon ? - Oh , what ? Was astronaut taken ? Am i right ? I want to help people . I want to change their lives . You know , i want to make ... i 'm sorry . This is boring . No , no . Yes , chatty cathy , cut the cord . God , what ... okay . Hate to have to do this to you , jaime , but you leave me no choice . You all right ? Ow , yeah , bionic ear 's hurting . Yeah , earache . I-i left my drops at home . Oh . Could you excuse me ? You 're an ass . Tick tock , okay ? The changeover for the lab isn 't till 11 : 00 . Yeah , which is in five minutes . Yeah , i know what time is it . I was doing ... what do you call it ... recon . Recon ? You can 't just throw around the word recon , okay ? That wasn 't recon . That guy wants to be on top of you . Really ? Do you think so ? Get your head in the game , sommers . You gotta get over to the museum . What are you eating ? Chinese food . Kung pao cafe ? You get the moo shu ? Mmm , low mein chicken . The moo shu 's better . You should see a ladder to the roof . There 's no ladder . Okay , what 's plan " b " ? Plan " b " is your bionic . Figure it out . Okay , hold on . You okay ? Yeah , just hanging on to my cell phone . It messed me up . So typical of this place . They spend $ 50 million on you , and then won 't spring for a bluetooth . By the way , i 'll bet my paycheck that the story about his dad dying of parkinson 's was a load of ... Crap ! You 're so cynical , Nathan . It 's not attractive . I 'm telling you as a friend . I 'm just saying that you can 't believe everything everybody says to you . And i 'm just saying you have to assume the best in people . You have to assume that not everyone is trying to screw you over . Even if it 's hard sometimes . Okay , hang on a sec . Okay , where was i ? Yeah , not everyone is gonna want to screw with you , even if it 's hard to believe . Wow , that 'd be a good attitude to have if you weren 't a spy . Why are you not in the lab already ? I 'm going as fast as i can , bossy . Crap . The glass is wired . Don 't worry , it 's an analog circuit . We can override that easy schmeezy . Can you find the contacts ? By the way , why are you using the accent with me ? I 'm a method actor . Fine by me . It 's literally the hottest thing ever . Found ' em . Okay . You gotta put something metal between the contact points to keep the circuit from breaking . Like a paperclip or a hairpin . Or a steel bar . Okay , give me the code . " 3QR4561 . " I 'm here , i 'm in . What do i do ? Computer , let 's start scanning . We need to get the dirt on samuels . So i 'm a glorified fax machine ? Come on , don 't sell yourself short . You can also open cans . We need to find out who he may have contacted about the neural implants . Okay , old journal articles . Mptp neurotoxicity . Apparently the guy 's a pioneer in Parkinson 's simulation . There 's some grant applications . Wait . Synthetic neurotransducers . That 's it , right , nathan ? No , it looks good . Now let 's get out of there . What are you doing ? I 'm just curious about him . I want to know how old he is . Unbelievable . Professor samuels . I know who you are . Sean , go back to my office and get started on the research while i talk to Ms. Whyte . I 'm well aware of every pharmaceutical company , competing unversity , and everyone else trying to steal information from us . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Just transferred in from Oxford . I don 't care where you 're from . I just want to know what you were doing in lab . Sir , i 've wanted to be part of this program for years . You know , you 're a pioneer in parkinson 's simulation . That 's why i transferred here . Your work is cutting edge . And i made such an idiot of myself in class , and someone said if i wanted to get back in the good books to clean out the monkey cages , and now i realize it was a joke , and i feel so stupid . How did you get past security ? The door was unlocked . Clarissa , what are you ... you didn 't actually clean out the monkey cages , did you ? Yeah , i did . I told her to do that . Sorry . I 'm also the one that left the door unlocked . I forgot some papers to grade . I came back to get them . The only reason i 'm here now is because i remembered i left the door unlocked . Never happen again . So ... You 're dedicated . I 'll give you that . Okay , tom . How about you escort ms . Whyte out . I 'm watching you . Thanks . What were you actually doing in there ? The truth ? Yeah . I was trying to get a copy of the lecture . I , um , can 't read my notes , and i 'm in way over my head . Well , i can help you with that . You can ? For a price . Dinner , tomorrow night . 8 : 00 work for you ? I 'm supposed to buy you dinner ? I 'm buying . I just want you to show up . Sure . You know what ? The next time you have a crappy lame hunch like this , put nathan on it , please . What 's the latest ? They 're getting through the appetizers . She had the caesar . He had the soup du jour . Both were wonderful . The tortilla soup was a little spicier than he expected . And i swear to god , if i have to sit here while they order dessert , i 'm gonna kill you . What a minute , wait a minute . Hold on . Hello . Yes , that 's right . Sunday won 't be acceptable . Friday . We said 5,000 . Get backup . We 're gonna need someone on this guy 24 / 7 . There are those who find dna mapping to be the key to our future . Me , it 's the map of the brain . The way we think . How , why , who we are is in here . Yes ? Check this out . Before the implant , the subject 's tremors were so severe he couldn 't hold a knife , A fork ... drive a car ... That 's amazing . You think that 's good ? Watch this . He can juggle . Great . No , you 're missing the point . The neural implant not only reroutes the pathways , but it acts as a receiver . You send a signal to juggle , and he juggles . What you 're seeing there ... Totally involuntary . It 's sick . Wait . You can make him do that ? Anything . Watch this . When a computer takes over his body , the subject can be more coordinated and capable than he ever was before . Stop it . Stop it ! We can modify pain tolerance too . Brave new world , isn 't it ? What do we got ? Nothing . The guy hasn 't made any modifications to the application . He 's just treating parkinson 's . There 's no money trail with him either . Maybe he 's not the guy . Whoa , whoa . Who 's that ? Oh , it 's the t.A. Who 's trying to get into jaime 's pants . Really . I know . It 's like , " keep your grubby hands off our 50 million dollar piece of ... " hey ! Yeah , right , right , right , right . So what do we know about him ? He went to undergrad at stanford . Majored in cognitive and neurosystem sciences . Oh , really . I went to stanford . Okay . I just think that technology has become way too advanced . Isn 't it creepy ? I mean , it 's mind control . Well , the possibility for abuse exists , but think of all the people who ... you know what , i don 't want to talk about the chip . Let 's talk about you . You 're just here for a semester , right ? Yeah . I guess i have to work fast then . Oh , wow . I know , bold . Yeah . Just tell me if i have to slow down . This is ... this is cool . I just realized this is my college fantasy . This is just what i thought it would be like . What ? What ? What ? - You ... you have something on your nose . - Oh , god ! No , it 's okay . Here , wait . Embarrassing . I think you need a little more on there . Hi ! Hi . What , you 're not gonna introduce me , clarissa ? Uh , this is tony , my ... uncle . How are you ? I know , it confuses a lot of people , me being american and all . Sure . Um , hi , tony . I 'm tom . Shouldn 't you be at work ? Actually , i need a little word . It 's really important . Oh ! Oh , well , i gotta get going anyway , but it 's great meeting you . We 're still on for 8 : 00 , right ? Dinner , you and me ? Okay . What the hell is that about ? We think samuels is clean . But that guy tom is under some scrutiny . He only has a paper trail for the last six years . Before that , nothing . That doesn 't mean he 's involved . He says he majored at cognitive neurosystem sciences at stanford . There isn 't a degree of that name at stanford . So he lied on his application . A lot of people do . He 's had a hard time . His dad died of parkinson 's , you know . We have to assume that he 's the enemy , Jaime . I don 't believe it . My gut tells me he has nothing to do with this . " The last time you listened to your gut about a guy , you had your limbs replaced . Your paper 's done . I emailed it to you . Mmm , these are delicious . I know , huh ? I have some butterfingers hidden in the bathroom , but they 're better dipped in butterscotch pudding . What 's with all the hiding food ? I just like secret food , okay ? Why is that such a big deal ? It 's time to take my meds . Hello . I thought we should have a little post-first kiss caucus . I 'm good with the kiss . It was great . Um , let 's do it again some time . Well , what are you doing right now ? Oh , not now . I 'm cramming . I have to go to the bookstore to get this book on neuroscience . Microchips for dummies , i think it 's called . Supposed to be brilliant . All right . We still on for 8 : 00 ? Absolutely . Great . Bye . Bye . Oh , my god . You totally like him . Stop ! You have no idea what i can do to you . I can 't stop myself . Help me ... Matches the one they pulled out the soldier in iraq . My god . Is he gonna be okay ? They think so . Who knew where you were going ? Tom . What did i tell you ? It wasn 't him . Can i just ... what does a guy have to do to get you to break up with him ? He had you manchurian candidated . The drop is now up to 5,000 chips . That 's it . I 'm pulling you off this . No , you 're not . Yes , he is . It 's too dangerous . I can help . If he 's the bad guy , i want to know just as much as you do . Come on . You 're not gonna get anybody closer to him than me . How 's your sushi ? Mmm , good . How 's yours ? Yeah , it 's great . I love sushi . I don 't really like sushi . Sorry . It 's okay , i don 't really like sushi either . Well , why did we come here ? I 'm sorry , this is a little weird . You feel weird . You just seem kind of stressed . Do i ? Just a little bit . I mean , it feels like something 's on your mind . You look a little preoccupied . I 'm sorry , i just insulted you , didn 't i ? That was terrible . This is not going the way i wanted it to go . No . I didn 't mean that . You look beautiful . You really do . And i don 't know why i 'm still talking . This is going kind of awfully . You look amazing , and i 'm - all i 'm doing is insulting you . It 's really terrible . Do you want to - do you want to get out of here ? I would love that . Shall we ? I think that 's a great idea . Yeah , best idea you 've had all night . Uh , you know what would be good ? Yeah , i 'm one step ahead you . Do you , um ... i know this may sound silly . Do you have any champagne ? Do ... ahem . You want champagne ? Yeah . All right , i 'll get some champagne . What kind do you like ? The pink kind . Of course you do . Be right back . This guy 's too good to be true . Tarragon ? He is the perfect guy . Tarragon ? He 's too perfect . He lied . I 'm an idiot . We 'll know if it 's the same chip by morning . Nathan needs to run a few tests , so we 'll just keep him under observation . He 's gonna want to know what happened to me . And he 's gonna want to know what happened to his microchip . No , just sit tight . We 've got your dorm room wired . " WHERE ARE YOU ? - TOM " Subject spotted with a blue sweater . Subject at the door . Five ... Four , three ... Two , one . Let 's do this . Go , go , go ! Show me your hands ! Show me your hands ! Don 't shoot , no ! Clear ! What are you doing here ? My brother lives here , man . I was just dropping off his ipod . I swear to you . This is for transporting the chips . Who supplies to you ? I don 't know what you 're talking about , what i am talking about is the everest project ! What i am talking about is American soldiers that you are participating in murdering . Tell me who is supplying to you ... Now . Was that your family ? Is this why you did what you did ? Nadeem ... You 're killing innocent men . That 's all you 're accomplishing . Tell me where the drop is and when the drop is , and no one else needs to get hurt by this . This is what i think . Too many people have died already . Your people ... Our people . So let 's just end this here . Hello . Jaime , the chip 's a match . Antonio just found out the drop is now , right now . We 're on our way , so you follow him . Do not let him make the drop . Kill him if you have to . Okay Hey , Lee . Here , man . Got the answers to the final , all right ? You 're a friggin ' angel , man . I know . Thank you . Excuse me . Can i have that ? What ? Can you give me your paper ? No , that 's mine . Just give it to me . No , it 's mine . I need this , okay ? No , you don 't understand ... back away . I need that ... back away ! Crazy bitch ! Whoa , let me guess . You stand him up too ? Obviously you thought i was handing him something covert . No , i ... who are you ? Who are you ? I asked you first . Why were you following me ? I wasn 't following you . Are you FBI ? No ! You 're friggin ' FBI , aren 't you ? You 're supposed to leave this to us . Who is us ? Come on . God , are you like a CIA agent ? Well , what the hell are you ? I 'm with the Berkut group . The Berkut group . Yeah . The insidious , arrogant , always getting in our way ... oh , did i mention arrogant ... Berkut group ? Look , it 's really just a temporary gig for me , okay ? Yeah . I thought it was you . Well , it 's not . I thought ... thought maybe it was you . You 're the good guy . Well , cia . It 's open to interpretation . The Berkut group had you investigating me ? First Samuels , then you . Sorry . That 's why you went out with me , isn 't it ? Yeah ... i mean , not at first , but then yeah . Well , that really sucks . Well , why 'd you want to go out with me ? Because i thought you might be the buyer . Yeah , well , same thing . No , no , it 's completely different . I marked you off my list before - what happened to your accent ? I 'm not really from England . Oh , that 's disappointing . I loved the way you said " brilliant . " It was really a selling point . It turned me on . Yeah , well , you wanting to be neurosurgeon was a big turn on and selling point for me , and that was crap , right ? Yeah . Your name 's not Claris , is it ? You 're not Tom ? Hello , Sean . You got it ? Stay right here . We 'll come to you . Wait , isn 't that ... yeah , it is . They 're making the drop . All right , i 'll go down , you stay up here and cover me . Don 't underestimate me . Relax , i 'm trying to be chivalrous . Drop the bag , Sean . That wasn 't a request . Don 't do it . Oh , i think you should do what i say . I 'm not afraid to die . I can arrange that . You all right ? Yeah . Look out ! Get up or die . Get up , get up , get up . Get up , get up , get up , get up , get up ! Don 't move , man . I swear to you , don 't move . Where 's sean ? You got some cuffs on you ? Yeah . You want to cuff him ? How did you do that ? Top secret . You all right ? I 'm good . Okay . Had a nice chat with our boy sean . Why 'd he do it ? Some deeply distorted political reason ? Money . So why does the CIA hate Berkut so much ? Well , you ask me , they 're jealous . We do what the military , the cia , and the fbi can 't . We don 't have any red tape or bureaucracy . We get things done , Jaime . Not a good idea . I can 't believe you 're leaving . Yeah , i have to go back to England . Family emergency . That 's too bad . You were my favorite roommate . Oh . Oh , check it out . You got an " A " on your James Joyce paper . Now the prof wants me to apply to her graduate program . So i don 't know how i 'm gonna get out of that . Oh , uh , keep it . I 'm late for class . See you around . See you . Where are you going ? I was just , uh , casing the joint . You know , gonna rob you later . You were coming to see me , weren 't you ? Yeah , i was just ... you know , i wanted to see how you were , and ... mm-hmm ? Come on , help me pack . So i joined the army right after high school . They gave me some tests . Sent me to college , trained me , and put me right in the field . I 've got a nice face . People trust me . That 's true . So ... What about you ? I mean , what 's your story ? I mean , you 've got quite an arm . Were you a quarterback in high school or something ? I don 't want to talk about that . It 's my last night at college . Can we just hang out ? Pretend we 're normal ? Can we just have a night ? Yeah . Wait , wait . I don 't even know your name . Jaime . Jaime Sommers . Hi , Jaime .

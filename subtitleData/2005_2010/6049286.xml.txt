 Mmm . Hello , Governor . Really ? Is he on now ? There are people who are frankly stunned by your seemingly meteoric rise . In the Senate less than three months and already closely allied with the President on what many people are calling unprecedented access to the average American 's most private details . Steve , I 'm just a humble junior senator from New York . But as Chairman of the Senate Commission on Homeland Security , it 's my duty to protect and serve the people of America . I can assure you , Governor , I don 't know any more about this than you do . Trust me , that 's ancient history . Haven 't spoken to him in close to two months . Now , if you don 't mind , I do have to get some sleep . The rumors in Washington are of frequent private meetings at the White House , and the question on everyone 's mind is , " What are you discussing ? " Well , again , these are matters of national security . We 're protecting the American people from a very serious threat . Are we talking about terrorism ? Let me assure you , the threat is real . We 're not out to alarm the American public , but it 's important that we take precautionary measures . Senator , I don 't mean to belabor this . Of course , but the questions remain , " Why you , why now ? " Well , I 'd love to go into specifics with you , Steve , but these are highly classified discussions . There are those that fear that what you 're really talking about is taking away civil liberties , relaxing FISA policies , expanding the reach of the Patriot Act . What about that ? Anyone who knows my record and my career will tell you I 've devoted my life to protecting people . As a District Attorney in New York , I was tough on crime . You want me to beg ? And now I 'm continuing that passion for the protection of an entire nation . Screw you . Is this about your religious calling ? I don 't beg for anyone . After your assassination attempt , you made claims that God has a mission for you . What do you want ? Yes . I stand by those comments . Now more than ever . Cover her hands . All right , we 're good . I 'm a God-fearing man . I just want what 's best for our country . Tell Petrelli we got the first one . Ando ! Breathe . Breathe . Breathe . Breathe . Peter . It 's over . No . I can save him . It 's no use . He 's dead . Hey . Damn it . I could 've saved him . No . You couldn 't . He bled out in the car . I should have gotten to him faster . He was pinned in there . So , I should 've been stronger . We can 't save everyone . I should 've been stronger . Well , any favorites yet ? Yeah . I mean , Hamilton , Smith , Georgetown ... They 're all the best schools in the country . Getting your GED was the best thing you could have done . An elite education is something most people only dream about . Claire , you 're an exceptional young woman , and you deserve an exceptional education . If you say so . Are you okay ? Look , I appreciate this , you putting me up and offering to get me into school , but I don 't think I can do this . Your father and I have discussed this at length . Which one ? Both of them . And we all felt that going to college was the best chance that you would have at a normal life . Everyone keeps saying that . But none of us have a chance at a normal life when he 's still out there . When who 's still out there ? Sylar . Claire , Sylar is dead . We stood there together and watched Primatech burn to the ground . They found dental remains . I know he 's out there . Okay ? I can feel it in my gut . He 's killing again , and my father is trying to hide it from me . I found an article in his desk about a man who went missing in Memphis . They searched his house and found his entire upstairs filled with salt water . No , I 'm sure there 's some explanation . My dad keeps going away for days at a time , going on " business trips . " It 's happening again , and I should be out there helping to stop it . Claire , you have got to believe me . It 's over . All of it . Primatech , the Company , Pinehearst . All of it . And we all have to accept that . No . You 're just trying to put me on the bench . He 's out there . And if I 'm the only one who sees that , then fine . I 'll go find him myself . You move and I shoot . Damn thief . Think you can come into my shop without me hearing you ? Martin ? Martin Gray ? Do I know you ? Did you live at 423 Canmore Street in Queens 27 years ago ? It was snowing . Middle of February , you went out for a pack of cigarettes at 10 : 00 and never came back . Or so the story goes . Kind of clich√© , don 't you think ? Who are you ? I 'm your son . And I have some questions for you . Oh , hey , I was just ... Working ? Yeah , I got done with all my morning deliveries , so I thought I 'd just come home . At 10 : 30 ? Are you spying on me ? Maybe . Look , I know I said I wouldn 't use my speed , but you got any idea how long it takes to get across midtown on a bike ? Yes , and that 's sort of the idea . But I 'm all done for the day . We could go to the zoo or something . Some of us still have to put in a full day . You know , I could use my ability to work my way clear to the top of the police force . But do I ? No . ' Cause you 're a bodyguard who makes 12 bucks an hour . At least it 's honest work . When you should be opening your own private detective agency like you want . I told you , I can get you the cash . I am not going to use stolen money to open up a business , Daphne . What 's wrong with trying to live like normal people ? It 's boring , for one thing . Well , I will take boring any day over this bizarro world that I 've been in ever since this whole thing got started . Come on . We talked about putting it all behind us and just getting everything back to normal . Just ... Normal . Okay . Fine . You win . Normal it is . Yes , I know that . But she has her own ideas . And now she 's circling the building on your whole operation . She found an article about a guy in Memphis that your team picked up . And she thinks it 's Sylar . You haven 't ? Well , then I 'm sure it 's all just her imagination . What 's your point ? No . Well , the point is she 's suspicious , and I can 't control her . That 's too bad , Mom . Because I was counting on you distracting her . If she digs , she 's gonna start finding things . And today is crucial . We have to keep her away from Peter and Parkman when we take them down . Mom , you hear me ? I want Claire as far away from all this as possible . Mom ? I think we have a bigger problem now . I 'm a very different person now . That was a long time ago . Maybe for you . You said you had questions . Well , ask them . How does a boy without a father grow up to be a man ? How does he learn to make the hard decisions he 's gonna have to make in life , the ones only a man can teach ? You want an apology , is that it ? You want to hear " I 'm sorry for walking out on you and your mother " ? I just want the truth . What about ? That your mother was a sick , infantile woman ? Or that I made a mistake ever to have a child with her ? Well , let 's start there . Because I 'm sure as hell not the son of a man who repairs watches and the woman who collected snow globes . So who am I ? Tell me . You were given to me . By whom ? A man who needed money . Your mother wanted a baby and couldn 't have one . I wanted out of a loveless marriage and was too much of a coward . Seemed like the right answer at the time . Who was he ? My brother . Is he still alive ? You 're telling the truth . Now , please leave . So , you planning on seeing him ? See who ? Your brother . He 's in town . I saw him on TV this morning . I didn 't see that . I haven 't seen him in months . Not really talking at the moment . Maybe you won 't mind me being honest . He scares the hell out of me . Why 's that ? My family 's from Iran . The things he 's talking about , protecting the country from dangerous people . That 's code . It 's not very subtle , either . He 's talking about people like me . We 're different , so we 're scary . But you wouldn 't know anything about that . Believe me , I know more than you think . Hello ? Claire ? Oh , Peter , thank God . Hey , where are you ? I 'm in New York . We have to stop them . Stop who ? Your mom , Nathan . They 're planning something , something bad . I thought it was Sylar . But it 's them . What are you talking about ? I don 't know . I think they 're talking about rounding up people with abilities . They already started taking them . This guy in Memphis , he disappeared ... Look , wait a minute , slow down . They were talking on the phone , your mom , your brother . They were talking about keeping me out of the way so I wouldn 't find out . They 're going after Matt Parkman today . We have to stop them . Okay , look , just take a deep breath . All right ? I have to warn Matt . I 'll go talk to my mom . And when I know something , I 'll give you a call , okay ? I 'm just going a few blocks . 87th and Madison , please . Hello , Peter . Mohinder . This is a coincidence . Last time I saw you ... I know . It 's been a long time . Keeping out of trouble ? Trying to . Although you ever get the feeling like you are meant to do something extraordinary ? I used to . Turns out I was mistaken . See anyone ? I try not to . Everybody 's under the radar . All except your brother , of course . Well , you know Nathan . Seems like every time I pick up a newspaper or turn on the TV , there he is , right out in the open . He 's not wrong , you know . These powers , uncontrolled , unrestricted , I see only danger in that . Do you ? I was living proof of it . Okay , so what happens when the government wants to step in ? That 's a necessary risk I 'm willing to accept . Segregation ? Internment camps ? People hiding underground ? We 'll agree to disagree . How much do I owe you ? Ah , it 's okay . It 's on me . Thank you . Take care of yourself , Mohinder . You too , Peter . Where to , my friend ? Just drive . It 's your dime . Who are you ? And what do you want ? I want you to get in the van . You 're surrounded . Get in . You wanna live , get in . What the hell is going on ? Those guys were trying to kidnap me . Do you know who they are ? No . Has anybody contacted you about people with abilities being attacked or abducted ? No . Have you had any contact with Claire ? No . Or Parkman ? No . What did Peter Petrelli tell you today ? How did you know ... Where did you come from ? What are you doing ? Sorry , Mohinder . Mom ? Mom , you home ? She 's not here . It 's been a long time , Pete . Sorry I 've been out of touch . I 've been kind of busy . Yeah , what with all the press you 've been doing lately . Right ? Well , you know the media , they like new and shiny . You got the whole country thinking you 're talking about terrorists , but we both know who you 're really talking about . What can I say , Pete , last time I tried to out us , I got shot . I 'm nothing if not a quick study . You 're just gonna round us all up , get rid of us ? Let me guess , you got our mother involved in this , too . Mom 's got nothing to do with this , Pete . It 's not Dad 's plans . It 's all me . You know how I feel about this . We 've been over it . I 'm doing what 's necessary . No . What you 're doing is turning your back on your own kind . It 's one thing to disown me , Nathan , but this ... You 're a self-loathing hypocrite . And you wonder why I haven 't returned your calls . Look , I said some things that were pretty harsh , I admit it . I got a little emotional . But I 've had time to calm down , and I 'd like to talk to you about some ideas . I 'd like your input , your advice . Advice ? What advice could I possibly give you besides " Kiss my ass , " Nathan ? I 'm just trying to extend an olive branch here . That 's all . How about dinner ? Tonight . Just dinner . I 'll text you when and where . Okay . Just out of curiosity , what can you do these days ? Do ? Your abilities . What are you , a cop ? What was the last thing you saw me do , Nathan ? You flew . Hey , how the hell did you get out of your tank ? You 're talking to a turtle again . You again . How 'd you get into my apartment ? What are you doing here ? I came to give you a message . It 's kind of a long trip for a message , don 't you think ? I am not really here , Parkman . It 's an illusion . Like life . It 's best not to make this any more difficult than it has to be . There are things you 'll come to know along the way in this journey . No , no , no , no , I 've taken way too many journeys already . I know it 's difficult to understand , but I went through the same thing when it happened to me . When what happened to you ? The calling . To be a prophet . You 've been chosen . No , I didn 't ask to be chosen for anything . All I want to do is live a normal life . But you 're not normal , Parkman . And you 've known that for a while . The world needs you to tell them the future . The future ? How the hell am I going to do that ? You 'll paint it . I can 't even draw . You will learn . Fine , so what am I supposed to ... Hiro . Thank God you 're okay . Claire . What are you doing here ? Did they come ? Did who come ? I don 't know , but you 're in danger . I heard Angela and Nathan talking about sending someone to take you down . Take me down ? I came to warn you . It 's happening again . Sylar . The Company . They are planning something . I don 't know anything about that . But something weird is happening to me . Weird like what ? I made these drawings . Except the thing is , I don 't draw . Or at least I couldn 't until now . What does this have to do with anything ? I don 't know . These are supposed to come true , I think . But they don 't make any sense to me . Is that supposed to be us ? You 're right . That 's us right now . What is that on your neck ? I know we have dinner plans . There 's just some things I need to talk to you about that can 't wait . Okay . I can only imagine how you feel about me after disowning you the way I did . I was selfish , arrogant , obsessive . Those are your better qualities , Nathan . I know it hasn 't been easy losing me as a brother and a friend . You need to know , what I 'm doing is hugely important for this country . For the world . I want to give you the chance to understand that before you make a decision that may change your life forever . I 'm not making any decisions . Okay ? I 'm just trying to live my life as normally as I can . That 's just it , Pete . You 're not normal . Pete , please tell me you understand that , so I can make arrangements to provide you with the protection that you need . Tell me you understand . Why are you asking me this ? What is it that you 're looking for me to say ? I 'm looking for you to tell me you 're with me , then I 'll leave . I can 't do that . No , I won 't do that . Look , I don 't know what you 're up to , but if it 's what I think it is , I 'm gonna fight you with every breath that I have . I swear to God . Okay . Hey . Can you give your big brother a hug ? Of course . I 'm sorry , Pete . Don 't hurt him . Hello ? Anybody home ? Mr. Gray ? Hold him tight ! Take him out . Who are you ? I said , who are you ? Simmons . Agent Daniel Simmons . All right , Agent Simmons . Where 's the man that lives in this house ? Where 's Mr. Gray ? I don 't know . Then I 'll ask another question . I walked into a trap . Who sent you ? A challenge ? Fine , I like a challenge . We have a couple of situations . Let me guess . Sylar . We 've lost communication with the team . I told you to put a bullet in the back of his head . Right here . The last thing I need is a body count to try and explain . We 're sending a clean-up crew . But there 's something else . Uncuff her . Give us a minute . I hate you . I know . You 're never going to get away with this . Someday you might forgive me , Claire , someday you might not . The important thing is that you get home right now and forget everything you 've just seen . What makes you think I 'm going to do that ? What , are you gonna threaten my family ? Claire , I 've given you a free pass . Don 't make me change my mind . Where are you taking them ? Follow me . Nice and easy . Flight 195 , you are cleared for take-off . Hiro . Peter . Peter , it 's me . Come on , wake up . Come on , we need to get everyone out of here . We need to break these shackles . I don 't have strength anymore . Suresh . Take his stuff off . Suresh . Come on . Wake up . Come on . Wake up . Wake everybody up . Go to the cockpit . We 're gonna make an unexpected landing . Claire ? Mayday , mayday , mayday ! Den Mother 3-1 going down , bearing 2-4-5 at 9-8 off Walnut Ridge VORTAC . We have lost pressure ! Mayday , mayday !

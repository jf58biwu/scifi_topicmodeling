 Light , in the absence of eyes , illuminates nothing . Visible forms are not inherent in the world ... but are granted by the act of seeing . Though the world and events do exist independent of mind ... they obtain of no meaning in themselves . None that the mind is not guilty of imposing on them . I bid my people follow , and like all good equations , they follow . For full endowment of purpose they do submit . In turn , they resign me to a role ... inhuman , impossible , and unaccountable . But I can no longer stand the sleepless nights . I think I am learning to love the Demiurge . Ground engagement effective . The enemy resistance has failed . Monican launch effort has been scrubbed . Target payload is secure . Dismantle that cheap rig ... and let the Demiurge bring us to peace eternal . Yes ? I didn 't want this either , but you 're alive , Rubio . I 'm as good as dead , sir . You 're not as good as dead . I 'm not as good as I would be dead ? Understand why . What we 're doing here . Sir ? Aeon . Sir . What are you waiting for ? Regroup and take apart the launch vehicle . - Wait ! - Sir ? I remember now . Sir , I can 't ... Let no Monican near the missile . Do you see how the blue light is making those patterns on the joints ? Yes . It 's beautiful . It 's delusion . Come on . We launch now . Celia , you can make it out of here without me . There 's a box under my bed . Destroy it . Crush it , burn it , anything . But don 't open it . You mustn 't look inside . No , please don 't go . Promise you won 't look inside . Fine . You know the sequence ? Yes . I 'm ready . - Do you have enough ammunition ? - Trust me . Almost there . Nader . You shot Rubio and not me . Now why is that ? Trevor , don 't trouble me with your thin smile . Stop ! There 's a pain in my back . Can you describe it in words ? - What ? - I want you to tell me about the pain . Sharp . Stabbing . Piercing . You 're telling me nothing . It feels like ... a nail twisting into my spine . - Yes , but there is no nail . - No . And so there is no pain . Nader . You bastard ! I thought he was dead . I think he is . No ! Yes , it is that which is ! It is not . What ? No ! Nader , how are you ? Aeon Flux , stop and think . It could have changed everything . Not the ways that we are . Everything ! Family members are reminded to have identification ready ... when entering the morgue area . Weapons and personal effects may be reclaimed in hanger 12 . Have you found this man ? Zenith , Nader . You were out there . You were ... Weren 't you with ... I 'm sorry . This man 's body is missing . - Listen , please ! - I 'll listen later . - After I find my gun . - Your gun ? Yes . Is this ... This one looks good . Please , tell me what you know . We won . We must have been right . You know something . - Tell me what you know . - What I know ? He said the light was beautiful . Yes , it was . No use , see ? Because the truth isn 't even pretty . What else ? Oh , right . Love isn 't the answer , it 's the problem . You don 't know anything about us . - Your friend Nader ? - Yes , Nader , Zenith . I 'm sorry about what happened . It was that gun . It was you ! Nader is dead . Nader 's worse than dead . You saw it yourself . I know what I saw . You ... Got it . There 's a box under my bed . Destroy it . Crush it , burn it , anything . But don 't open it . With the perdition of dreams , the rights of youth fade like pale smoke . And on embers doused by blood of loss ... we ask , " For whom serves this vantage of hideous strength ? " To reap another harvest and ... Address to the public , number 41961 , take 1 . Fellow citizens , at 4 : 20 this morning , the 39th division special forces ... carried out a daring strike against those Monicans ... who have conspired to deprive us of a great event . An event that could usher in a new era of peace . As planned , our precise tactics have kept ... casualties on both sides to minimum levels . May we all hail a great victory . To those who have lost sons and daughters ... we express our deepest gratitude ... Sir , excuse the interruption . Yes , what is it ? There seems to be a disturbance . Incoming Monican aircraft are releasing projectiles of some sort . Sending us our own dead . Erase take 1 , record take 2 . The height of tension in any game occurs ... when the rules allow for the influence of human judgment . The advantage in this instance is held by the player who drops the ball ... to allow the opponent a hollow victory . Half of eternity is still eternity . Infinity and zero are different degrees of the same value . Pain isn 't real beyond the individual who feels it . But the nail is real . Trevor , what are you up to now ? Who was that ? Damn . That 's it , forget the damn bird . Nader ! Natural evolution should amount ... to nothing by now but a vicious cycle of obsolescence . A world unaccountable to its own past and doomed to repeat it indefinitely . Oblivious of any consequence . - Sagittal dilator . - Huh ? Quickly , damn it ! Oh ! Hernial contractions ! Scalpel . I said , scalpel ! Not you again . Trevor , you looked better before . You don 't know what you 're doing . That thing ... Is your salvation , and mine . It is the everywhere , the everything , the every all ! You ! You drove it out ! All right , you got it . You got what you wanted . So you answer to no one . Are you out of your mind ? The only reason I don 't shoot you has nothing to do with duty or principle . It 's simply a matter of knowing who I am . Is that why you won 't let it see you ? Why you can 't bear the gaze ? Because you 've done terrible things . Then there are the transgressions you never even knew you committed . Those are the worst because those you can never forget . All you can do is suspect . I 'm not in the habit of arguing over the colour of red herrings . Help me save your friend . Maybe you were wrong to have shot him . Just check his breathing . Celia . You didn 't look in the box , did you ? Just keep breathing . - What 's so funny ? - I don 't ... Nothing . - Am I making you uncomfortable ? - I 'm fine . No , I don 't think so . See , I think you just gave it away . You laughed but you caught yourself . Why ? Because you 're conscious of it . You didn 't drive it out . It 's still here . I forgot something . You can 't hide from it , Aeon , it 's everywhere . What ? Now this is odd . What ? Get out ! This is all wrong . It must still be down there . And it knows we have its best interests at heart . Let it go . Funny how things work out . No ! Don 't let go ! - Trevor , I can 't keep ... - Don 't let go ! If but the cosmos could possibly have come about innocent of history ... and not wholly ignorant of all its potential . - Celia ! - Unprejudiced but aware . Nader ! - You didn 't look in the box , did you ? - No . - I didn 't see it . - It ? Yes . No . I didn 't look . I never saw it . Rather than that its only trial be performed ... at the mercy of all its error .

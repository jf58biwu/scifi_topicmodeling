 Chapter Five - Hiros When a change comes , some species feel the urge to migrate . They call it zugunruhe . The pull of the soul to a far-off place . Following a scent in the wind , a star in the sky . The ancient message comes , calling the kindred to take flight and to gather together . Only then can they hope to survive the cruel season to come . Peter Petrelli ? What ? Are you doing this ? You look different without the scar . - I don 't know you . - Not yet . My name is Hiro Nakamura . I 'm from the future . And I have a message for you . I don 't have much time . I 'm risking a rift just by coming here . The girl ... You have to save her . - What girl ? - The cheerleader . - It 's the only way to prevent it . - Prevent what ? Everything . Listen to me . She must live . The painter , Isaac ... Go to him . He will know . When I call you , you must tell me where we meet . You told me many times how lost you felt . Before it all started . This ... is what you 've been waiting for . Be the one we need . Wait ! Save the cheerleader , save the world ! Wait ! Hiro ! I don 't understand ! Hiro ! Where are you ? I ... - I don 't understand ! - Peter ! Are you all right ? The cheerleader . She 's got an airway . - She 's breathing . - She 's got circulation . I 'm fine . I just wanna go home . Looks like she was driving . There was a lot of blood in her mouth . I don 't see anything . - Is her mother here ? - Claire ! Oh , my God . Is she okay ? - Your daughter 's gonna be fine . - Does it hurt ? - They said you 're gonna be okay . - Oh , I 'm fine . - I just wanna go home . - Sweetie , doctors just wanna run some tests first . I 'll call your father . I 'll tell him to come . Crazy bitch . Do you have any idea who I am ? Better than even you do . All right , look , I 'll pay you anything , okay ? You name it . We don 't want anything . We just need to know a couple of things . That 's all ... That was entirely unnecessary . You might as well go ahead and shoot now . 'Cause I 'll find you . And I will kill you . Unlikely , Mr. Petrelli . - I 've seen your faces . - That , I 'm afraid , won 't be a problem . Put him down . Where is he ? What 'd you do with Mr. Petrelli ? - Who ? - The guy you slept with . Where is he ? I don 't know . I don 't know how I got here . - I have to call my son . - Don 't even think about it . Get dressed . - You 're coming with us . - Leave the lady alone . If you have a problem , it 's with me . You have a congressional candidate ... - missing from your hotel . - My team 's working on it now . If you 'd like to review the security tapes with us , you can come with me . Fine . Let 's go . Admirable work , Ms. Sanders . Feel free to go home , secure in your solvency . What did you do to me ? As I saw it , a lot of things were done to you . However , none of them by me . No . I left . I didn 't go through with it . Mr. Linderman reviewed the tape . And , needless to say , he was quite pleased with your performance . Either that 's you , or you still owe Mr. Linderman $ 50,000 . Go home to your son , Ms. Sanders . And tell him that his mommy doesn 't have to worry about people asking for their money anymore . I ... uh ... He was right there ! Then he teleported away ? He ... he stopped time somehow . He talked to me . He knew who I was . He says that we all meet up ... somehow . Sometime in the future , I guess . Look , it seems crazy , but I know what I saw . He said something bad is gonna happen , but we could stop it . First we have to ... save a cheerleader . A cheerleader ? It seems impossible , I know . - Impossible ? It sounds mad . - Please , just ... He said that I have to go to see Isaac the painter . Okay , he 's gonna know what we have to do . So let 's just go back to his loft . If the answer isn 't there , I promise that I will drive you to the airport myself . You can go back to India and you never have to hear from me again . Will you fly me there yourself ? There are no answers . Go home , Peter . Someone there has to be able to do something to find him . No ! He went out on assignment , and he hasn 't checked in since ! I ... Look , will you just have Detective McHenry call me . Never mind . He 's home . Hey ! Where the hell have you been ? Do you know how worried I was ? I must have drank too much and passed out on the couch . Do we have any aspirin ? Uh ... you have been gone for a day . What ? That 's impossible . No , it isn 't , trust me . I 've been awake for every hour of it . And I called the precinct a dozen times , and they said that you were working with the F.B.I. Yeah . That just started . I was gonna tell you about that , but , um ... But what ? Where were you ? I was , uh ... - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? Do you have any idea what I 've just been through ? I kept picturing you in a ditch somewhere . And then every time the phone would ring , I 'd think it was somebody calling to tell me that ... I didn 't know you cared that much . I 'm your wife . I always care . I mean ... It 's good that you do , but , you know , you 've barely spoken to me lately . Except in our therapy sessions , Janice . What if something happened to you ? You worried about me ? That 's a good thing . That hurt more than I thought it would . You bastards ! You don 't know who you 're messing with ! I don 't think they can hear you . Well it makes me feel better ! Wow ... Good ... I 'm starving . Shut up , I 'm not talking to you . Do you think they have waffles ? I said I 'm not talking to you . I can 't believe I got beat up because of you . I 've never gotten beat up before . I got punched too . Once . They kept kicking me ! My jaw is clicking , did it used to click ? Let 's just eat then get the car back , okay ? This is all your fault , Hiro . All you had to do was stop time , and we would still have our money . My fault ? We got beat up because you made us cheat at gambling . Using my powers for personal gain . That 's the Dark Side . Not being broke is the Dark Side ? Oh ! Waffle ! Yahoo ! I don 't know why I 'm on this stupid trip . I 've told you now a hundred times . To save the world . " Save the world ! " Don 't you ever think of anything else ? All you 've done since you came to America is complain . If you 're so miserable here go back to Japan . I 'm not miserable here . I 'm miserable with you ! Then go . Go gamble and meet girls . Hang out with your internet stripper without me if that 's what you want . Fine ... maybe I will . - Okay then go ! - Okay ... - I 'm not following you . - Good ! You don 't even know anyone in Las Vegas . You don 't know anyone in this country . Yes , I do ! I 'll probably save the world faster now . All right , I get it . A guy in his pajamas . Ha ha . Now , we can all stare and have a good laugh , or one of you could lend me your cell phone . Can I help you ? I 'll take one of those T-shirts . And a cup of coffee , while you 're at it . Okay , so two porterhouse steaks , both medium rare . And , um , what sides do you have ? You know , one of everything 's great . Cool . Thank you . Bye . Why aren 't you at work ? You been , uh ... you been sleeping next to me all this time , and I ... I miss you . But I know ... I know you think I 'm lazy . And that I don 't know how to listen . And all I do is ... Mope . Well , um ... You know what ? That 's okay . Maybe you 're right . Maybe I just need to try harder . I think we both do . Good . 'Cause we 're calling in sick today . - No . No . - Oh , yeah . I got it all planned out . Just go get dressed . Can I help you ? Hiro . Hiro Nakamura . - Nathan Petrelli . - Petrelli . Nathan . - Very nice to meet you . - Thank you . Flying man . Oh ... you fly . I see you . Whhshh ! Thank you . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , it 's okay . I keep secret . I bend time onto space . Teleport into future . We are both special . All righty , then . Oh , I ... I go to New York . I see future . Big boom goes there . Bad for many people . Boo-khashhh ! I can see where that might be a problem . Don 't worry . I stop it . Am hero . Lucky us . Better go . In this future that you see , you don 't happen to know whether or not I win the election , do ya ? Yes , um ... Petrelli . Uh-huh . Nathan . Ah , hai , hai , hai ! Yes ! I know you . Nathan Petrelli . Election . You win . Very big win . Landslide . Yeah . I gotta get back to Vegas . Uh , give me ride , please . Hmm ? Ride . Boo boo . Sure . Well , what the hell ? - What 'd you say your name was ? - Hiro Nakamura . - Where you from ? - Tokyo , Japan . Ah . Never been there . Hi . Your mother told me you lost control of the car . That 's what I told her happened . Is there something you want to tell me ? I ran the car into the wall on purpose . - You could have killed yourself . - I wasn 't thinking about me . Well , what were you thinking about ? Claire . You 've got to start trusting me . I lied to you . About what ? I lied to you when I said that ... I lied to you when I said nothing happened ... at the bonfire . What happened to you ? He tried to ... - He tried to force me . - The quarterback ? He threw me down , and I hit my head , and I woke up somewhere else . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry that I lied to you . I didn 't know what else to do . I can 't prove anything . He was gonna get away with it again . I 'm not the only one . Please , you can 't say anything . No one 's gonna know . No one 's gonna know a thing . Hello ? Isaac ? You doing okay ? Go away , man . Isaac , I need your help . You need help ... ask Simone . You already took her . What else do you want from me ? You painted me . A picture of me flying . Okay , it happened . It was real . I flew . Congratulations . I 'm telling you that I believe you . That you can paint the future . So whatever is happening to you , it 's happening to me too . And I don 't know why , but I 'm supposed to ... see you . You 're supposed to have the answer . Is that what , um , I sound like ? No wonder she left me . I don 't have any answers . You 're supposed to ... know where I have to go . See for yourself . It 's her . The cheerleader . I 'll get it . Thanks . Vote Petrelli ! Early and often . - Oh ... up , up , and away . - Absolutely . Vroom , vroom ! Move ! Get out of the way ! Whoo hoo ! Maybe there 're instructions . It 's all English ... Tell Sakamoto I 'm back , and we need to talk . Yes , sir . Didn 't think I 'd see you again . It 's all right , I 'm good , I 'm good . What the hell did you do to me ? I could ask you the same thing . All I know is that I woke up in your room somehow , and you were gone . All you know ? We had a great dinner , then you leave . You come back and attack me . I have one of the best nights of my entire life . And the next thing you know , somebody 's trying to throw me into a van . I don 't know what happened last night . I swear . All I know is that when I met you , I was trying to be someone I 'm not . And that 's not who I wanna be . Who do you wanna be ? Someone good . A good mother . Not the person that I see in the mirror . Look , I don 't know how much of last night was an act and how much was you . The girl I met , that 's the kind of girl you spend your entire life waiting to meet . Somebody strong , somebody beautiful , somebody ... good . I didn 't know they were gonna do anything to you . They blackmailed me . Just like they 're gonna blackmail you . They taped us ? I 'm so sorry . Wow . Is it Christmas ? No , no , come here . What is all this ? This is the Shiraz from that great place in the Sonoma Valley . Remember we went there a million years ago , - and you 've been thinking about going back ? - How do you know that ? And , um , porterhouse steaks from Mickey 's that you craved . And I 'm gonna pretend that , uh , that I cooked for you tonight . Oh , and , uh ... - Wait , I 've had that song in my head for days . - Oh , I know . I don 't know what to say . How about , uh ... " Pass the salad . " So , who is she ? That 's nice . What , a guy can 't pretend to cook dinner for his wife without being accused of cheating on her ? Well , you were missing for a day , and now this , and ... Okay , sorry . I thought this was what you wanted . Everything I could think of ... you thought of first . It 's our best ... date . It 's our only date ... we 've had in a long time . I know . Okay , you know what ? Let 's , um ... let 's call this the first of many to come . Why , do you have something planned for tonight ? - Oh , I do now . - Good . Hello , Brody . - I 'm Claire 's father . - I know who you are . You 're the guy I 'm gonna sue . - I 'm very sorry about the accident . - It wasn 't an accident . - What makes you say that ? - Because she crashed my car on purpose . She 's a freak ! She 's ... not human . I 'd put more stock in her humanity than I would in yours . - You tried to rape my daughter . - I didn 't touch her . Well , it 's her word against yours . And from my perspective , she 's the more reliable witness . You don 't know your daughter . I know her better than even she does . I don 't have to listen to this . Shh . Claire is a very special girl . It 's confusing what 's happening to her , and she doesn 't need some punk making her life any more difficult . Do you understand me ? I should kill you . But instead , I 'm gonna do you a favor . You already threw away this life . I 'm gonna give you a second chance . I 'm gonna let you forget all the terrible things you 've done . And maybe this time , when you wake up in your new life ... You 'll make something decent of it . Shh . Hollow him out . Take everything . This is amazing . Look , it 's telling a story , like a comic . This girl , she 's ... running and ... I ... Is that me ? Why would I paint you ? These two guys ... I think we 're all trying to help her . Cheerleader . - Who is she ? - I don 't know . Yeah , but you painted these . I was high , dog . So what happens next ? - Where is she ? - I was high ! I could have been clean . I tore myself apart . I lost Simone ... to try and find an answer . How to stop it . All I got was this garbage . Some cheerleader . It 's nothing . I 've ruined my life for nothing . It 's not nothing . Look , don 't you get it ? Everything is connected . We are all connected . If this thing that you painted , this bomb , is true , we 're all dead . These are the key to saving us . Something 's gonna happen to this girl . We need to know what . You have to finish this . You ... You have to finish the painting . Even if I wanted to , I can 't . I 'm out of drugs . I 'm out of money to buy drugs . Can 't you just finish it without shooting up ? If you got some cash on you , man . That 's another story . We can call it a commission . I saw it . What ? I saw something in the , uh , in the canvas . A picture . This painting ... I can finish it . You can paint ? No . No , I can 't . But ... I drew the future after I saw you the other day . It was only stick figures , but ... It came true . Hi , Brody . I know you probably don 't wanna see me right now or hear what I have to say . But I have to say it . What you did to me ... what you tried to do , was wrong . But what I did to you was wrong too , and I 'm sorry . I think that everyone deserves a do-over at least once in their lives . I ... I don 't know you . Who are you ? Brody , it 's me , Claire . Why do you call me Brody ? Micah ! Where 's my son ? Micah ! Is he ... Oh , God . Honey . Honey . What happened ? They showed up a few hours ago . They 're looking for D.L. I told them you haven 't seen him in months . - Ms. Sanders ? - Uh-huh ? - Is this your husband , Miss ? - Yeah . What 's going on with D.L. ? Did he try to contact you at all in the past few days ? - My dad didn 't do anything . - Micah ... I need you to wait with Tina for another minute , okay ? Ma 'am . Your husband was spotted at a convenience store not far from here about an hour ago . - He 's here ? - No sign of him yet . But we got cars hidden around the block in case he tries to make contact . D.L. ' s been on the run for six months . Why haven 't you caught him ? We had him in custody two days ago . He pulled a Houdini , slipped out of his cuffs . D.L. Hawkins is a killer . He ... he has been following me . - Doing things . - What sort of things ? Look , if he 's here , and he wants something , I won 't be able to stop him . - You need to protect us . - We 've got someone coming . - He 's headed for the house . - Get these people safe . He 's headed for the back door . Repeat : cover the back door . Dad . Freeze ! Hands up ! Hands up ! Niki ? Your men are worried about you , Mr. Petrelli . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Though I can 't say I 'm pleased with the security situation . You have the hotel 's sincerest apologies . Consider your stay on us . If there 's anything else you need , just ask . Actually , uh , I was wondering how that tape turned out . Consider it a favor you 'll repay one day . Or what ? For a man whose campaign is founded on sound family values , this could be really embarrassing for you . Especially considering your wife . On the other hand , that tape really isn 't worth much unless I win , is it ? Why don 't you just give me my four million , and I 'll fly back to New York and put it to good use ? Our agreement was two million . It 's rather generous . You know , I thought so too . And then I thought , " Gee ... it must be pretty important for Linderman to see me in office if he 's willing to go to this much trouble to keep me in line . " $ 2 million makes me a candidate in your pocket . Four million makes me a congressman . Oh , that was ... Oh . I love you . I love you . It 's like you 're in my head . It 's like ... Mmm . I love you . - What can I get you ? - Nothing . Just sleep . For a week . Coffee ice cream . - What ? - You got it . Coffee ice cream coming up . I , um , I skipped lunch . - Is that the same as ... - Here we go . Hey , um ... You have aspirin ? Thanks . Security cameras won 't see me . - If he makes a move , I 'll blow his head off . - Now let me see ... If I eat cookies , then I 'm gonna have to work out . Clean everything out of the register . Probably get a couple hundred in cash too . Hey . Look , I know why you 're here . And I just wanna say don 't do this . What the hell do you know ? Nothin ' . But I 'm a cop . But I am not armed . Okay ? I just came in here to get some ice cream for my wife . But I know what you 're thinking about doing . And I know that you could ... pull out the gun that you 've got in there , and you could shoot me . But then you would be throwing your life away . And for what ? A couple of 20s in the register , huh ? Look , I know you 're hurting . But Marie ... is waiting for you . At home , right ? And Vincent 's getting out in a month . All you have to do is just ... take your hand out of your jacket pocket ... and put the gun down ... and get out of here . Oh , my God . Is that a gun ? - What 's that guy doing ? - No , no , no , no . - Why does everybody try to rob me ? - No , I 'm a cop . You do not look like a policeman to me . - I can 't believe this is happening . - No , it 's okay , I 'm a cop . Oh , my God . This is crazy . I 've gotta get out of here . I 've got kids . It 's okay , I 'm a cop . I just wanna get out of here alive . Okay ! You 're * * * the guy from Japan ? He 's one of my customers . I run a web site . How did you find me ? WHOIS database . You need unlist , maybe . You shouldn 't have come . I live here . My kid is in the other room . What did you think was gonna happen ? I 'm sorry . We chat so much online , I thought ... I thought you maybe help me . You got the wrong girl . That person that you see on the Internet , that 's not me . You get the difference , right ? Do you understand ? You want us to take him in for trespassing ? Just ... let him go home . It was ... nice to meet you . Okay . We 'll leave a squad car outside in case your husband decides to show , Ms. Sanders . Thank you . Hello ? I guess we call the artist again . How 'd you do that ? I don 't know . We have to save her . Ignore it . It 's a wrong number . Some Japanese guy keeps calling , leaving messages . Hello ? Mr. Isaac ? Isaac Mendez ? Who is this ? Uh ... My name is Hiro Nakamura . My name is Peter Petrelli . I have a message for you .

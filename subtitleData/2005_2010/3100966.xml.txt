 My name is detective Brett Hopper , and this is the day that changes everything . Freeze ! Put your hands up ! You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder ... Who the hell are you people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I am living the same day ... over and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . Every morning , I get another chance . For every decision , there 's a consequence . - I can save my sister Jennifer ... - You 're acting really crazy . - There isn 't any time . - What is this about ? I can track down every lead . Hopper , you should have received the package today . The message on your answering machine came from the home of a U.S. attorney , Nathan Baxter . Anything else you 're not telling me , partner ? But today , I need some answers ... You called and left me a message about this package . - Who told you to call me ? - Garza . Before it 's too late . If I can get here earlier tomorrow , I might be able to help her . Hopper , I need your help . I 've done something terrible . I love you . I love you , too . When will I see you again ? Tomorrow . I 'll see you tomorrow . - Rita ? - Hopper , I need your help . I 've done something terrible . Andrea , tell me what happened . It 's Eddie ... I think I killed him . All right , why don 't you take me through it ? He came over . He was high . He was tweaking so bad . He got violent and ... I fought back . And ... he went over . God , he 's dead . - This is my fault . - No , no , it 's not . We both knew what Eddie was into . - I didn 't mean to kill him . - Just stop it . He brought this here . You were defending yourself . We 're gonna fix this . We 'll leave him at his apartment . There 's a pay phone around the corner . We can call 9-1-1 from there . You okay ? I know you 've got problems of your own , Hopper . I just didn 't know where else to turn . He was my partner , too . When was the last time you talked to him ? Couple months , maybe . - You know if he was still using ? - I don 't know . I mean , how long did we work with him before either of us realized , right ? Eddie had his secrets . I didn 't feel a pulse , I swear to God . - Hang in there , man . - We gotta get him to a hospital . St. Francis is the closest one , but it 's the other way . St. Francis . Okay . You 're gonna be okay , man . - Oh , no ... - I can lose him . No , if we run , he 'll have a bird on us in minutes . - I don 't think Eddie 's got minutes . - So we can 't waste 'em by going nascar against a black and white . Just be cool . All right , hang in there , man . We 're gonna get you some help . Hang in . Narcotics . These are my partners . We 're on the job . - What happened to him ? - He was U.C. on a buy bust . Took a hit from a couple of bangers . We 're trying to get him to the hospital Let 's go . We 've got an injured officer here . 6-l-14 , I 've got an injured officer at Alvarado and Glendale with his partners . Show me escorting to St. Francis memorial hospital . Code three . Follow me . You know I can 't go in there . I know . I got this . Need some help over here ! Come on , this side , this side . Where 's your other partner ? Brett ? - Hey . - I didn 't hear you get up . I just ... I didn 't want to wake you . I like when you wake me . Now you 're all dressed , and I 've missed all the good parts . That 's a good part , too . Baby girl , I 'm trying to get an early start . But save me some of that for later , all right ? Well , later it might be all gone . Sweetie , it was ... it was just a joke . No , I know . I just ... I got a ... I got a lot on my mind . You wanna tell me about it ? It 's Andrea . I think she may be caught up in something with Eddie Reyes . Eddie ? I haven 't heard his name since he got fired . Well , he popped up yesterday . So what exactly are those two caught up in ? I don 't know . Trying to figure that out . Eddie 's had a rough time of it . I hope he 's not in any more trouble . Please . Eddie ain 't nothing but trouble . I gotta go . I have to see this lady about a package . - Lady ? - It 's evidence . Might be important . Hey , I know this is a little bit out of the blue . You gotta stay away from Eddie today . What the hell are you talking about ? I think he 's using again . Listen , if he calls , don 't pick up . If he comes over , do not let him in . - Where are you getting this ? - Just trust me . Stay away from Eddie today . Okay ? Okay , yeah , I got it . Who was that ? Hopper . He says I should stay away from you . Typical Hopper . All I 'm saying is , why today ? The same day that you gotta go to I.A. , he calls out of the blue to talk about me . He 's gotta know something . Then why didn 't he say something about us ? He did . He said to stay away from me . You know how Hopper gets an idea in his head , he can 't let it go . You mean , like , how he got me canned ? Come on . You know that 's not true . Thought you were on my side . I am . Come on , baby . I 'm just worried about you , you know ? You just said so yourself , Hopper gets an idea in his head , he doesn 't let it go . He 's going to I.A. today , too , and what if he knows what you 've been doing ? He doesn 't . Then why call this morning and tell you to stay away from me ? Is there something you 're not telling me ? Like what ? Come on , baby , of course not . You 've seen me at my worst , spun out . There 's nothing I can hide from you . Hey , how about I take you to La Cabanita tonight ? - You know you don 't have to . - I know . I 'd like to . Even a rent-a-cop can afford that . They played me some voice mail , a woman talking about some package they sent to you . They think it has something to do with Garza . You called and left me a message about this package . - Ava , I 'm Brett Hopper . - How did you find me ? Don 't worry about that . Where 's Baxter ? He 's in the shower . Now I know that you work for Garza . I know that he had you send me a package . - I need to know why . - Garza never told me . Why are you asking me , anyway ? Why don 't you just talk to him ? Garza 's dead . He was killed last night . My God . When ? I mean , why would anybody ... Right now I 'm trying to figure all that out , but I think it may have something to do with that package you sent me . Now please , I need you to tell me everything . Garza was acting nervous . When he brought me the packages , they were both sealed . I didn 't see what was inside . He just said to send them . - There were two packages ? - You didn 't know ? Yeah , I sent one to you and one to someone ... someone named ... Mathis . Jennifer Mathis ? You know her ? She 's my sister . Put your clothes on and get the hell out of here . You 're in danger , too . And stay away from Baxter . Wait , so you never received a package ? - No , I haven 't gotten anything . - You never got it . - Your husband must have taken it . - Randall ? Look , just tell Randall I 'm coming over to see him . - Brett , that doesn 't ... he 's not here . - Where is he ? He left work and went home . We got a call . Our alarm went off . - What ? - No , it 's okay . - It happens by mistake ... - Stay there . I 'm coming to get you . I thought you were supposed to be at work . I was worried about you , after your I.A. meeting , you know ? With Hopper calling this morning and all . So what did you tell 'em ? Slow down , slow down . - They know what ? - About Slim ... Everything , okay ? They 've got pictures and bank statements . I don 't know what I 'm gonna do here , Eddie . - They say anything about me ? - This is my ass we 're talking about . Come on , don 't be that way , baby . - Hopper 's the one who did this to us . - This wasn 't Hopper . Okay ? Hopper 's wanted for murder . - What ? - They say he killed the A.D.A. , Garza , and they want me to help bring him in . Offered me a deal . I roll on Hopper and they drop the case . - What 're you gonna do ? - He 's my partner . What if he did it ? Then you help bring down a murderer , - and you walk away clean . - And what if he didn 't ? Then you help prove his innocence , right ? And everybody wins . - Eddie , I can 't ... - No , baby , no . You take this deal , I.A. goes away . Slim goes away . I can try and clear my record . I mean , this could be a second chance for both of us . Look , I didn 't roll on you , and I 'm not gonna do it to Hopper . Is there any time you don 't side with that guy ? They just told you he killed somebody , and yet you 're still backing him . What about us ? Why are you looking at me like that ? Are you using again ? You think I 'd do that to myself , to you , after everything you 've done ? - It 's just a question . - No ... No , that 's a question that Hopper put there , right ? That 's what he told you this morning . So he doesn 't just get me fired , he gets to ruin us . Probably just take his side on that one , too ? Randall , it 's me again . Call me . This isn 't like him . I 'm gonna kill him . - What ? - Nothing . Don 't " nothing " me . You pull me out of class , you drag me home and then you won 't even tell me - what the hell 's going on . - I would if I knew , but for now , - you 're safer with me . - Safer ? What are you talking about ? Are we in some kind of danger ? - Is Randall ? - I don 't know . I can totally tell when you 're lying ... I just wish you 'd be a little bit more worried about yourself and a little less about your husband . What is that supposed to mean ? That 's Randall 's car . Jen , wait ... let ... hold ... Let me check out the house first . Yeah . Hopper , we need to talk . Yeah , I 'm a little busy right now , Andrea . Look , you called me this morning , okay ? I need your help . Andrea , I gotta call you back . The whole place is tossed . Nobody 's here . Why would anybody do this to us ? I think they 're looking for that package . Do you think they have Randall ? - Forget Randall . - What ? For all we know , he could be involved in this . What is wrong with you ? My house is turned upside down , my husband is missing and all you can say is that maybe it 's his fault ? All I 'm saying is that it 's a possibility . You never liked him . You always assume the worst in people . I 'm following my instincts , all right ? It 's my job . That 's right , your instincts . That 's why I don 't hear from you for a month . That 's why you missed your niece 's birthday . What are you talking about right now ? Look , I 'm sorry if I don 't have time for the perfect family - and the perfect life ... - It 's not about being perfect . It is about being there ! That 's why your relationship with mom - is so screwed up ... - What ? My relationship ... you keep turning her against me . That 's what 's wrong with my relationship with ma ! It 's never your fault . You are just like dad . You wanna play it like that ? Where 'd you get these bruises on your arm , Jennifer ? Where 'd you get those ? - What ? - What ? Yeah , I know about 'em . You don 't understand . You don 't . Brett ? Hopper ! - Randall , how did they find me ? - I don 't know , Brett ! - Did you tell 'em ? - No , I swear to god I didn 't tell 'em ! They took me , and then they were gonna get Jen , and they looked at that thing on the dash and they knew . I think it 's a G.P.S. or something . Brett , what the hell are you doing ? Where is the package ? What did you do with it ? I swear I don 't know anything ... - I don 't believe you ! - Stop it ! Let him go ! I 'm going to count to three , you hear me ? One ... two ... - Brett , please don 't ... - I have it ! I hid it , okay ? I was scared . I got a call . They said , " don 't tell anyone , " and I opened it and I saw that . - Do you know who this woman is ? - No . I thought it was some kind of threat , so I hid it . I didn 't even tell Randall . Jen , I 'm a cop . This is what I deal with . I can protect you . - Why didn 't you ask me for help ? - I tried . - When ? - Last night . I called you six times . And I called you back . You said something was wrong with your phone . What are you talking about ? You never called me back . The cops are coming . Get the hell off my property . I 'm closing my tabs . Anything else ? No , thanks . Tough shift , huh ? Just be glad your day 's not as bad as mine . ... in baseball , the Dodgers have once again defied expectation , coming back from the dead with a 7-run rally in the bottom of the 9th to beat the Giants 11-10 . I knew it . I told you this would happen . But nobody believed me . Didn 't I say this would happen ? I shoulda put money on that bitch . Hey , man , how did you know they 'd win ? Because the Dodgers rule . Right . Yeah . - Go , blue . - Go , blue . Yes , this is detective Spivak . I 'm looking into an old case . The D.R. Number is 91-1183944641 . Okay , well could you transfer me then , please ? So someone checked out the murder book . I need to know who . What did you say ? Internal Affairs pulled a murder book . I need to know the name of the requester . Well then , what time do they open ? Hello ? Hello ? - Hello ? - Hey , it 's me . - Thank god . Are you okay ? - Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Brett , you know what they 're saying . They brought me in , they asked me questions , told me terrible things . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry they put you through all that . - You know none of it 's true . - I didn 't believe it . I love you . I love you , too . Now , I have to ask you a favor . Honey , I need to speak to Chad . Now I don 't have time to explain . I know he 's there . That 's fine . I just need to speak to him , because it 's very , very important . It 's for you . It 's Brett . - Hey , partner . - Internal Affairs pulled a murder book for a case from 1991 . I need you to tell me who . Classic Hopper , target of a citywide manhunt , but it 's still " I need , I need , I need . " I 'm trying to prove my innocence here . Great . Come on into the station , we 'll talk all about it . Why don 't you come get me ? I 'm at the corner of ... Andrea , please tell me that you did not see Eddie today . Hello ? You turned her against me . - Eddie ? - You did it , Hopper . - Remember that . - Eddie , what are you doing ? Put it down ! Andrea . I like when you wake me . Now you 're all dressed , and I 've already missed all the good parts . That 's a good part , too . Do you remember Eddie Reyes ? Of course I do . Are you still feeling bad about how that went down ? No , no , it 's Andrea . I feel like she may be getting caught up in something with him . Like what ? I don 't know . It might have to do with the I.A. Investigations , though . Whatever it is , it 's not gonna end well . How could you possibly know that ? Because I 've seen it happen before . Yeah , but the difference is you . You 've seen this kind of thing happen before , so why don 't you help her ? Don 't let it happen . It might not be that simple . Well , then at least you tried . Be safe today , okay ? You too . That thing on the dash . I think it 's a G.P.S. Or something . - Hopper , what are you doing here ? - I need to talk to you . I know this is coming out of nowhere , but ... you gotta stay away from Eddie today . - What ? - Yeah , he 's using again , so if you see him it 'll just ... it 'll end bad for the both of you . Where is he ? - What are ... - Where is he ? Hey , Hopper . You got a lot of cojones , coming her saying that crap about me . You lied to me . You 've been all business with me for the last six months . All of a sudden we 're best friends , confiding secrets in each other ? I never hid anything from you . Oh , like the fact you 've been looking into the latin disciples ? Thought I didn 't know ? How is what we do together any of your business ? - You stay out of this . - No , no , no . You lost the right to tell me what to do when you called in that drug test to get me fired . - That 's not what happened , Eddie . - You expect me to believe - that you didn 't even know about it ? - You weren 't doing your job . That 's right . You just had to protect your reputation . And now you 're gonna screw Andrea the way you screwed me . You 're on your own . - This is Chad Shelton . - Chad , it 's Hopper . Hopper , didn 't expect to hear from you so early . - The meeting 's at 3 : 00 . - Yeah , I actually had a question for you . I 've got some questions for you , too . I was gonna wait to ask them in person . So , then , uh , we 're still on ? Oh , I 'm sure we 're both looking forward to spending this quality time together . - So why are you calling me ? - I 'm looking into this ... homicide from 1991 . Now the records say that Internal Affairs pulled the murder book . Do you have any idea who ? I can 't wait to help you out with that , buddy . Can I get you anything else ? Maybe walk your dog for you ? Wash your car ? Maybe you wanna sleep with my ex-wife ? Oh , wait ... Punk . Tough day ? Yeah . Things 'll look up . What can I bring you ? Just , uh , some coffee , please . Okay . Yes , this is detective Spivak calling from Homicide . I 'm looking for records . Yes , I will hold . Well , I know Internal Affairs has it . I 'm trying to figure out who . Can I please speak to your lieutenant ? I need to talk to your captain . This is the Los Angeles police department . Your call is important to us . Your estimated wait time is 15 minutes . Let me ask you something , woman . This look like white wine to you ? Oh , now I know you didn 't just do that ! Now bring me what I ordered . Yeah . Detective Hopper , I understand you 've been making some calls . - Who is this ? - It 's not going to be that easy . You 're going to admit to killing Alberto Garza . Well , you 're calling me , who ever you are , so you must want something . I 'll get right to the point . You do have something I 'm looking for . The packages . Very good , detective Hopper . Okay , you want the packages . I want some answers . You bring what you have to Elysian park . There are some picnic tables . The one on the North end at 2 : 00 p. m ... and I will bring you all the answers you need . Okay , if I get there , and it looks like a trap , I 'm gone . Detective Hopper , you act as though you have a choice . Andrea , I cannot do tthis now , okay ? I tried to help you early this morning . You 're on your own now . Please , Hopper . Andrea ? I need your help . It 's Eddie . I made a terrible mistake . What happened with Eddie ? I can 't go to the police because of I.A. , and Eddie ... look , I need you right now . And no one else can help me . If we don 't find him , he 's dead . Please , Hopper . I can 't do this alone . You bring what you have to Elysian park ... and I will bring you all the answers you need . You don 't always get to choose who you fall in love with , though , right ? I mean , I knew Eddie had been using , but I thought that was behind us . I helped him get clean . He was better . I didn 't think it was gonna be like that again . What happened ? You did ... this morning . After you left , he got so mad . He started throwing things . He ran off ... and then he found me here at the market later . I 've seen him like this before , and I know he 's gonna do something stupid . He had his old . 38 , and I know he 's gonna score . Where does he go to score ? Danny Yan . Slim ? Your C.I. ? Yeah . What exactly is Eddie mixed up in ? There 's a lot more bounce than bouncer for club like this . Something 's wrong . None of Slim 's guys are on the floor . Get everyone out there . He doesn 't leave this neighborhood . Battle . I should 've known . Where 's Eddie ? - We had a little disagreement . - What did you do ? Tell me something , babe . How does a pathetic tweaker like Eddie score such a sweet slice of pie like you ? Yeah , keep talking , slim . I will shoot your ass . Hey ... I 'm a victim here . I just got assaulted in my place of business by your boyfriend , which , by the way , doubles your juice . Shut up . Hopper doesn 't know about our little arrangement , right ? You want to arrest somebody , detective , try our star-crossed lovers here . One of them 's got a nasty habit he can 't keep up with , and the other one , well ... can you put somebody away for being an enabler ? Ah , ah , don 't , don 't . See , when Eddie was on the job , he got used to taking home free samples , but ex-cops don 't get glass for free , so Charlie 's angel here kept bailing him out . Straight out of Shakespeare , man . So sad . Did you wake up this morning and decide you wanted a bullet in your head ? Because the day I 'm having , you do not wanna get on my bad side . - All I 'm saying ... - Where 's Eddie ? ! Somewhere on foot between the 110 and the cornfields . Chinatown ain 't that big , man . You better hope you find him before we do . Yeah , you better hope we do , too . You were paying off that dirtbag ? That 's what I.A. ' S got on you ? - It 's not that simple . - Yeah , it is . You were giving money to a drug dealer . They we gonna kill Eddie , okay ? I couldn 't report it . I didn 't have a choice . Do you have any idea what I gave up to help you ? My family , Rita , their lives are in danger because I 'm being framed for murder , and today I had a chance to find the guy behind it , maybe even stop it , but I didn 't . I helped you instead . - I 'm sorry , Hopper . - " Sorry " ? " Sorry " doesn 't keep me out of jail , or Rita from getting killed . " Sorry " doesn 't end is damn day . " Sorry " . Every morning ... I wake up and I think , maybe today 'll be different , but it always ends the same . He 's 30 days clean , and I 'm back in Slim 's parking lot , hoping to God I find Eddie alive . But I can 't give up , because what if today it is different ? Maybe today he kicks it , or he dies . If it were someone you loved , wouldn 't you do everything that you could to save them ? I know where Eddie 's gonna be . - He 's gonna show up near here . - How do you know that ? Trust me , just keep looking . - I 'll take the inside , you take the street ? - Yeah . - Your keys . - Eddie . - Give me your keys . - Put down the gun . Now . Now . Shut up . Shut up . Hey . - Keys now . - Eddie . - Shut up ! - Hey , Eddie . This isn 't you . Eddie , don 't do this . Don 't do this . You never got it , did you ? I mean , you just ... you didn 't even try to understand . - Please , Eddie , you don 't have to ... - I 'm talking here , baby . All right , what didn 't I understand ? I got seven years on you , and you still made d-2 before I did . You know , I mean , not everybody 's a super cop . I just wanted a little relief . Okay , okay , I get that . I get that . But your beef is with me , no Andrea , so let her go , man . - Just put down your gun . - You know I can 't do that . Eddie , come on , it doesn 't have to go down like this . You know that ... that cholo that I caught up in Boyle Heights ? You know , that low-level dealer ? What ? - I patted him down ... - Eddie , stay with me - Why don 't you just listen ? - All right . In ... booking , I find out that he 's got a little 5-shot just jammed in his belt , and he coulda popped us at any time , and I didn 't catch it 'cause I was tweaking . So I look at this guy , and I say , " you know , why ... why didn 't you shoot me ? " And he ... he just looks at me and he said , " because you seem like a nice guy . " I should be dead , and you should be dead . We ... all of us should be dead because of me . - It 's over , man . - No , it 's not over . Eddie , listen , we can all walk out of here together . - Whoa , hey , hey , hey ! - Eddie , no ! I didn 't make the call , Eddie . You hear me ? I didn 't make the call . All right ? But I didn 't warn you , either . Now I 'd heard that the drug test was coming down , and I knew you were using , but what 's on me is that I coulda helped you , and I didn 't , and now I 'm asking ... all right ? There . I 'm asking you now , please , let me help you now . - No . - Eddie ? Let me help you . Let me help you this time . Okay . I got you . - Okay . - Sorry . All right . all right . I 'm so sorry . - Morning . - Hey , good morning . I didn 't hear you get up . - I didn 't want to wake you . - I like when you wake me . Is everything okay ? The phone is ringing . Yeah , that 's that 's what it does . - This hasn 't happened before . - What , someone calling you ? - Are you kidding ? - No , it 's not that . Something 's changed . - Andrea . - Hey , Hopper . So ... this might sound a little out of the blue , but ... I 'm taking Eddie to rehab this morning . There 's a lot to tell you . You still there ? You didn 't have to come . I can do this without you . Yeah , well , I just wanted to see for myself . You know , you threw a lot at me on the phone . Sorry . It 's just ... when I woke up today , I felt ... I felt different . Different ? Like ... like how ? Like I had this weird urge to call you , and then all this stuff came out , and ... it 's strange . I 've been feeling so hopeless , but today , I don 't know . So it ... it 's good ? Yeah , and even with this I.A. Stuff , I mean , I woke up with the strangest idea . Why don 't I just tell Chad the truth ? I 'd like to think that , uh , you know , he wouldn 't crucify you , but ... Yeah , I 've already called my league rep and told him that 's what I 'm gonna do , so ... If I get days , I get days . And ... if I loose my job ... at least I 'm not dead . What ? Why ... why does that make you laugh ? No , it 's ... this just isn 't the day that I expected to have . Yeah , me neither ... but here we are . What about Eddie ? Well , I don 't think he 's happy to be pushed out of the nest . I don 't think it 's gonna be easy either way . What are you looking at ? - My old partner . - Don 't look so smug . I 'll break my foot off in your ass , cabron . So you got any gas in this piece of crap , or what ? What , is this this some kind of joke ? What are you talking about ? Like I 'm supposed to see this , and it 'll remind me of what kind of cop I used to be or some garbage like that ? What 's supposed to remind you of that ? This stupid picture that you dug up . - You knew about that picture ? - Yeah , I should . - I was the first officer on scene . - What ? Jane Doe . Body dumped in a car off Figueroa . I was a rookie . I didn 't know much . That 's when I first met your old man . He was okay . My father was there ? Yeah , he was the lead detective on it . But he didn 't close it . Evidence went missing , and it just all fell apart . It 's funny how they always hinge on some little , stupid thing .

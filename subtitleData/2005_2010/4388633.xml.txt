 Previously on Heroes . You know what question you should be asking yourself ? " Who would want to save Peter ? " If you wanna know what 's missing from the files , who can fly ... A long time ago , I gave up trying to figure out what Angela Petrelli would or wouldn 't do . Daphne 's alive , Matt ! The only thing that matters right now is finding Daphne and getting her back . Don 't you come any closer to me . Everything 's gonna be all right . No , it 's not ! You turned me into a terrorist ! It was Danko . He 's got his own agenda . You 're lying to me ! It 's from someone named Rebel . Who ? ... and the words " Save Matt Parkman . " We are here to save Matt Parkman . You 're holding him . Matt Parkman . You sacrificed me for your own personal gain . You don 't have to like me . But you do have to understand that I am your last hope . Is that so ? Front door open . Front door open . Front door open . Perfect timing . Cloud just burst . Coming down in all sorts of ways . This should be our last conversation . It 's not safe for you to be seen with me . I 'm touched , or I would be if I could imagine that you really care about my safety . What I care about is having an awful lot depending on a man too distracted to pack an umbrella on a cloudy day or use a proper razor . Family is a horrible price to pay for what we 're trying to do . And the irony of sacrificing my relationship to my sons to save my sons isn 't lost on me . Well , I 'm sure that Nathan will find that it serves his agenda to forgive you . Of course he will . But Peter ... Peter , I 'm afraid , won 't . He 's said his goodbyes . Now that Danko has thrown Nathan from a building and watched him fly away , it all comes down to you , Noah . I hate to be dramatic , but there it is . Danko doesn 't trust me . Then make him trust you . Get his mind off Nathan . Give him some kind of feather to put in his cap . Give him one of us . If I were a better woman , I 'd suggest you turn me over . That would show him whose side you 're on . What makes you so sure I haven 't ? You need a bigger feather . Give him Rebel and Danko will be your best friend . You do realize you may be needing Rebel 's services very soon . I 'm resourceful . I 'll find ways to survive that don 't involve Rebel . I 'm going to leave the city tonight before something unfortunate happens . You 've got 15 minutes to catch the next rail to D.C. Take my umbrella . Don 't say I never did anything for you . Thanks . I wouldn 't go home if I were you . Don 't say I never did anything for you . What is this ? An effective way of stopping any of you from hurting any of us . Neat , huh ? Why don 't you just do it the old-fashioned way and dig a ditch ? This is gun control . Everyone in this room is armed and dangerous , yourself included . Where 's Daphne ? She 's right over there . I 'm afraid she 's not doing very well . Why was she moved from the medical facility ? There was the American taxpayer to consider . I want to speak to Nathan . Nathan Petrelli flew away . Look , this woman is dying . I need to get her to an emergency room . I can 't do anything to help her here . I don 't want you to help her . Then why did you bring me here ? I figured it would be a whole lot easier than carrying you . Hook him up . And let 's make up a bed for Miss Strauss . I brought you a present . Is that the same line you used on Suresh to get him in here ? No , he needed a little more convincing . In light of recent management changes , it 's important that you and I get along . I couldn 't agree more . So , happy whatever . Since the puppet man menaced your wife and fugitive daughter , I thought you 'd get some satisfaction out of seeing him strung up . It 's my gift to you . How 'd you catch him ? I 'm smarter than the average bear . Well , since you 're in such a giving mood , allow me to return the favor . How would you like to see Rebel lying here ? I would like that very much . He 's hacked into our system twice in the last three days . We 've tracked two messages , both to Tracy Strauss . He 's going to try to rescue her , and I think we should let him . Bad idea . Strauss is a killer . We 're not setting her loose . If we open the cage and let the rabbit run , she could lead us right to Rebel . They 'll both know it 's a trap . I 'm not suggesting we make it easy . And if you don 't catch Rebel ? Then I put a bullet in Tracy Strauss myself and chalk it up to self-defense . Fine . Let the rabbit run . Don 't worry , Baby Matt Parkman . We will make you big again ! Baby Matt Parkman , we will save you . If you understand , shake rattle once for yes , twice for no . A suicide attack on the capitol building thwarted by federal authorities Tuesday night ... Bad baby . No television for you . ... reported to have been instrumental in disarming Parkman , who was later ... Hello , baby . You are loved . ... on the scene by government officials . Senator Petrelli has been very vocal recently regarding certain threats to national security . Hiro . ... unnamed terrorist group . It now appears that a member of that terrorist group has been identified . Once again , former L.A. Police officer Why have we stopped ? Don 't stop the car . It 's a traffic stop . There 's ... What have we got ? Where is she ? We 're looking . Check every car . We lost the target . Excuse me . I foolishly gave my umbrella to a friend . I hope you don 't mind if I get close . Not at all . Cover all points of interest . They lost Angela Petrelli . I guess someone tipped her . Or she saw them coming . She does that , you know . She 's on the Island of Manhattan . She has a cell phone . We 'll track her signal . It won 't read my code . Rebel , Rebel . Rebel . Doctor . Oh , God , wake up . Come on . Come on , you need to wake up ! Where 's Daphne ? Come on , get up . You got to wake up . We 're getting out of here . Come on , wake up . Daphne ! Are you okay ? We have to get her to the hospital . She 's gonna slow us down . Yeah , then she 'll slow us down . Come on . Up , up , up . She 'll slow you down . I 'm leaving . No , no , no . Tracy , wait . We 'll all go together . Open the door ! All clear . All clear . So we just walk out the front door ? Yeah . Aren 't you glad you waited for us ? If we get out , I 'm not waiting for anyone . This won 't happen again . If Strauss does lead you to Rebel , kill them both . Chalk it up to self-defense . Do you want me to check any sizes , miss ? No , thank you . Actually , could you get me a smaller size in this ? Hello , Tracy . This is one instance where being out for yourself didn 't serve you . You should have stuck with Matt Parkman . You could 've walked right past me and I never would have known . We did walk right past you . Then you went on your own , and now here we are . But I think I can pull this trigger faster than you can turn me to ice , but I don 't want to take that bet . I 'll take it . While you were playing Abu Ghraib , I was trying to make ice in an oven . This is a breezy 68 degrees , and I 've worked up a hell of a cold snap . Well , like I said , it 's a bet I 'd rather not take . Everything all right in there , miss ? Oh . Yeah . I know . " No boys allowed , " but my fianc√©e is very self-conscious . Would you mind getting this in a size down , please ? Thank you . Thanks . Who is Rebel ? I don 't know who Rebel is . Rebel knows who you are . He went to a lot of trouble to break you out . I think he has something in store for you . I suppose you do , too . Here 's how being out for yourself can serve you better than it has in the past . Lead me to Rebel . How will that serve me better ? Lead me to Rebel and I 'll let you go . You won 't have your old life back . That 's gone forever . But you 'll be on the outside , and you 'll have a chance . And if I run ? If you run or if you kill me and then run , there won 't be another conversation . It 'll be a big fat " cut to black . " And that 'll be it for you . Help ! Help ! I need some help . Orderly ! I need a gurney , now ! Matt ? Where are we ? Come on , honey , it 's fine . You 're gonna be okay . Honey , it 's gonna be okay . Matt , you have to be ready to move . Chest wound septic . Prep for surgery ! Ma 'am . Can you tell me your name ? Her name 's Janice . I 'm her husband , Matt . This woman 's been shot . What the hell happened ? It was a duck hunting trip upstate . Her family 's idea . And she shoots herself . Just stupid . A clumsy accident . And her dad 's a doctor and patched her up and said she 's gonna be fine , but she 's clearly ... She 's not fine . Okay . Look , look , we have to report all gunshot wounds to the police . This was clearly an accident . But this clearly was an accident . I should stick close . Make sure she 's okay . You should stick around . Make sure she 's okay . She is gonna be okay ... Look , we 'll do our best . Excuse me . " Life from Lifelessness . " No , baby ! Bad baby ! You 're not from the baby-sitting service . Are you currently a Federal Bank of Washington , D.C. Customer ? Tracy Strauss , get free access to our savings program . We 'll match 100 % of your savings for the first three months . Get free checking , online banking and more with Federal Bank of Washington , D.C. Please wait for your receipt . Thank you . Taxi ! Union Station , please . Taxi . You know , I thought you said you were going to be late . Oh , my God . Hello , Millie . You look like you 've been mugged and the first thing they stole was your dignity . Having a bad day . Let me tell you about my day . It 's been exceptional . I was detained by people with badges for three hours . They came pounding on my door right in the middle of my Pilates session at 10 : 00 a.m. , had all sorts of questions about the company I keep , or kept . So you can understand why I 'm not in the mood to be ambushed . I 'm in trouble , Millie . I know we haven 't spoken in some time , and I 'm sure after this morning you can and are wondering why . You were never the same after Arthur died . We all saw it . I chalked the moodiness and the shoplifting up to grief . But , good Lord , Angela . What did you do ? Is it pills ? I have dug my sons a very deep hole and I 'm just trying to dig them out again . And you 're here looking for a shovel . Looking perhaps for a change of clothes , maybe a car , whatever cash you have on you . I need to disappear . You want my advice ? No . Turn yourself in . Whatever it is you 're doing , just stop . Just because there 's a road unfurling in front of you doesn 't mean you have to take it . Well , sorry to have bothered you . For what it 's worth , it was good to see you . Wait . It 's everything I have in my wallet . It 's , I don 't know , a couple hundred dollars . Thank you , Millie . Enjoy your lunch . Watercress soup was always a favorite . I 've called the police . They 'll be here any minute . Get going . Mother of Matt Parkman 's child , let us explain . Your baby is in danger . Who are you ? Do you know that your baby is special ? It started during the eclipse , just like it did with his dad . Are you here about what Matt did ? Yes . We are heroes like Matt Parkman . He 's not a hero . He 's a terrorist . Honey , can you turn on the TV ? A suicide attack on the Capitol Building - Good . By former Los Angeles police officer , Matt Parkman , was thwarted by federal authorities Tuesday night ... Senator Nathan Petrelli was present ... I came straight home when I saw this on the news . Matt Parkman wouldn 't . Someone made him do that . Yes . They want everyone to think that we are the terrorists so they can justify what they 're doing . Diabolical . " We are the terrorists . " You mean like the people that can read minds or whatever ? I am currently powerless . But Ando ... People like us are being arrested . By who ? The government ? Yes . They 're rounding us up , and they 're coming for Little Matt . We were sent to help . The government is coming for my son ? He is just a baby . He 's no threat . That must be the police . I never called the police . Janice Parkman ? Yes . We have a warrant to bring you and your child in for questioning . I assume this is about my ex-husband . Yes , ma 'am . Why do you need to question my son ? He 's never met his father , and he can 't talk . The warrant is for you and your child , ma 'am . Is the child home ? He 's at the babysitter 's . I could take you there if you like . That would be appreciated , ma 'am . Okay . I 'll just get my things . Search the house . What ? Let 's go . Check in there . It 's all clear . I 'm sorry we couldn 't save you , Baby Matt Parkman . Can you say , " Yatta " ? Yatta . No ? It 's okay . You convinced them I was Gwen Stefani ? Uh . Yeah . It got you a good room , didn 't it ? How long have I been out ? Two days . The doctors have been pumping you full of antibiotics to kill the infection , but nothing but the best for Gwen . I thought I was duck-hunting Janice . The " I 'm an idiot with a gun " story ? Who is duck-hunting Janice ? Um , Janice is , uh ... Janice is my wife . She was ... She 's my ex-wife . So the " idiots with the guns " story is true ? Uh , yeah , except no one got shot . Anyway , I needed a believable back-story , so I ... Slotted me into your ex-wife 's life . Yeah . I guess . Yeah . Why , was that wrong ? No . It 's just enlightening . You needed a believable back-story because you and me , we don 't really have one . Yes , we do . Do I have clothes ? Yeah , they 're ... Matt , you had a dream that we were married . So you think that 's a reason for us to be together . Turn around . We are supposed to be together , and I didn 't dream it . I went on a ... On a spirit walk . You got baked in the desert . That 's , uh , not a lot to hang a relationship on . I 'm hanging our relationship on the fact that I love you . Whatever we had or have , it 's all in your head . I don 't wanna be your surrogate Janice . No , no . You 're not . You 're ... You 're not . It was nice meeting you , Matt . And that 's the first time I 've ever said that to anybody and actually meant it . So , it was nice meeting you . Wait , wait . No . You have to stay . You gotta stay here with me . I mean , what if they catch you ? I 'm not gonna slow down long enough for anyone to catch me . Not even you . Westbound metro line now boarding . Departure in 10 minutes , track 11 . We 're sitting next to each other . I hope you don 't mind . Micah ? What are you doing here ? I 'm Rebel . Get over here . What have you gotten yourself into ? I 'm helping people , people like us . I thought we could help together . Micah , listen ... I know you 're not my mom , but you don 't have anybody else . Is something wrong ? I didn 't know that it was you . I led them right to you . Who ? You led who ? Wait . You 're bait ? I didn 't know that it was you . Doesn 't matter who you thought it was . How could you do that to anybody ? Thought there was a good chance they 'd follow you . I just didn 't think that you 'd be in on it . Attention , Union Station passengers , a gas leak has been detected This way . In our basement food court area . A station-wide evacuation is in progress . Excuse me ? Ma 'am ? Can I help you ? Ma 'am ? She went up here ? Clear , down that hallway . Michael , we 're going upstairs ... Sending elevator down . Move in . You must 've been a Boy Scout . What 's the Boy Scout motto ? " Be prepared " ? Yeah . Clearly you weren 't a Boy Scout . Because I 'm a girl ? Because the first rule of Scout law is to be trustworthy , and you suck at that . I know . I 'm not proud of myself . I don 't understand you . You got into politics to protect the civil liberties of the everyday American . Oh , God . You read my bio ? I read everything on you . Okay ? I thought that meant I knew you . I thought that because you look like my mom , that I knew you . If I met you earlier in my political career , maybe I 'd be more like my bio , but I 'm not that person , and I 'm not your mom . I know . You 're nothing like her . My mom , who was the everyday American , was a hero . You 're just a politician . Who are you ? Che Guevara ? Che Guevara led a revolution . This is a rebellion . So whose side are you on ? And " mine " is not an answer . Can you tell the sprinklers what to do ? I can tell the fire alarm to tell the sprinklers what to do . Okay . Then tell them to make it rain in here . Find a way out . Come with me . I can 't . Keep doing what you 're doing , Rebel . Go . And , Micah , stay ahead of the ice . She said she had a hell of a cold snap . Any sign of Rebel ? No . Don 't worry , Baby Matt Parkman , you will see your mother again , when it 's all safe . She 'll be very proud of you . You 've been very brave . You didn 't cry even once . But if you want to cry , it 's okay . If you feel like crying , you can . But when time starts again , you have to be brave . Yes . Your attention , please . Bus 352 to San Bernardino and Las Vegas is now departing . Hiro ? Penny for your thoughts . Since when did you start paying people for their thoughts ? And , more importantly , how did you find me ? You love Paris like I love ... Don 't . You got here awfully fast . How 'd you get here ? I flew . How 'd you get here ? I ran on water . So you 're Mr. Concorde now ? You read minds . You don 't fly . All right . You are flying . I didn 't know you could fly . I didn 't know you could run on water . I can run on anything , except air and the vacuum of space . Otherwise , I 'd be living on the moon . Honey , see that ? We are learning new and intriguing things about each other . That 's the kind of thing you can hang a relationship on . Wanna go for a ride ? I 'll show you Paris like you 've never seen it . Once around the tower . How high can we go ? As high as you wanna go . You just have to hold onto me . You really would do anything for me , wouldn 't you ? Just say the word . Then let me go . What ? We 're still in the hospital , aren 't we ? And this is all you , in my head , trying to give me a storybook ending . Sorry . Don 't be . I 'm not . But , Matt , you deserve the real thing , not a fantasy . I just wanted to make you happy . You did . Do one more thing for me ? Anything . Fly me to the moon . So what do you want to do now ?

How 'd you guys make out ? Oh , were fine . Its the listings Im worried about . At the very least , llI bet every one of our For Sale signs fell over . We had damage at the school , wouldnt you know ? Thats whatwe get for not fixing that roof when we shouldve , butwith funds being cut every year ... Youd think educating children would be more of a priority in this country , but youd be wrong . Governments got better things to spend our money on , like corporate handouts and building bombs . Daddy , is there a fire ? Is Mommy all right ? Im sure shes fine . Dontworry , okay ? Mind what youre doing , Sally . Oh , come on , we got 10 days leave . Check our papers . Look , I told you , all leaves are cancelled . I dont knowwhy . I gotta go check the pharmacy out . Three men meet me back at the Jeep in five minutes . Thats an order . Shit , man !

Wandas looking after little Victor . Shes only 8 . Sometimes she forgets shes supposed to be watching him . I told them Id only be gone a few minutes . Shes only 8 . For their sakes , dont . Well , isnt anybody gonna help me ? Shh . Its okay , pal . Wont somebody here see a lady home ? You ? You ? Its okay , buddy . - You ? Maam , please , I got my own boy to worry about .

Shes new in town as of this semester . Teaches third grade and the special ed kids , nowthat Moshers retired . Shes wonderful . The kids love her . And Davids an artist . He does movie posters and such . And me ... Lord , Im babbling away like some old biddy at a tea party ! My nerves are jangled , I guess . Boy settle down ? How is he ? Still hot . Why dont I get him some aspirin . - Aisle three . - Okay . Thanks . How 's Dan ? His nose stopped bleeding . Hes calmer now . Somebody gave him a Valium . Cant believe the way he ran in here . Never seen him like that . I need something to cover my boy up . Got any blankets ? Furniture pads . Loadin dock . Gonna keep checkin on people . If you need anything , just holler . You bet . Sally , you mind ? Oh , Id love to . I really should help him clean up . - llI take him . - Okay . Daddy , dont go . No , llI be gone two seconds , Big Bill . Come on , Im gonna get your blanket . Mrs. Repplers here , and so is Mrs. Turman . Ill be close by , okay ? - Okay . - Dontworry , Im not far . Okay ? Let me look at you . Hmm ? Wanna lie down ? Yeah . There you go . Soon as it blowss away , we can walk out of here safe andfree , butwe have to be smart about it . First thing we need to do is keep our wits about us and find outwhats happened . Well , howwe gonna do that , my man ? Weve got no phone signal , got no radio . Im sure theyre working on those problems as we speak . It stands to reason that restoring communications would be their top priority . Jeez ! Oh , shit . Ow ! Shit ! God damn it ! Ow ! Ow ! Bitch ! Its obvious thatwere ... were in some kind of natural disaster here . Aint nothing obvious about this sombitch from where I sit . There aint nothin natural about it either . Thats right . Its Judgment Day , and its come round at last . There is nothing more obvious or natural than that . Ohh , fuck , now . Youve done that to yourself , by a life of sin and dissolution . Hey , whoa ! David ! Hey , you guys hear that ? The generator ? Were just gonna check it out . No , no , I turned the generator off . It ... itwas backing up . - N-nobody else heard that sound ? - What sound ? I dont know , like a ... weird noise , back there in the dark . Like something was , like , pressing against the door . Did you hear it before the lights went out , or after ? No , only after . After , but , look , I heard it , okay ? - Nobodys calling you a liar . - Thats what it sounds like . No , no , no , no . Now , dont be thattaway , Mr. Drayton . You had a scare , no doubt . What saywe all go check it out ? Here . Oooopf ! Man . Its pretty rank in here . - Myron , go check it out . - All right . Go on , fire it up . All right ! Shut it off ! Holy crow , dont that stink ! Somethings got the exhaustvent plugged up from the outside . You get it running long enough to raise that door a little , llI go out and clear whatevers blocking it . No , no , you cant do that . Why not ? Its an electric door , right ? Well , yeah , but it may not be wise to send him out there . Okay , llI do it . No , look , its not about who goes out there . What , dont you think I can do it ? Hey ! I want to go ! Itwas my idea . Well , wait , just stop , okay ? - J-Jim , right ? Mm-hmm . Myron ? You guys are ... you , well , you dont seem to understand , or youre trying real hard not to . This is no ordinary mist , okay ? You open that door , and something gets in here . Like what ? Well , like whatever made that noise I heard . Are you guys being willfully dense ? Mr. Drayton , youll pardon me , but Im not convinced that you heard anything . I mean , were not hearing anything now , right ? Anybody ? See ? Now , I know , I know ... youre a big shot artist with connections in NewYork and Hollywood and all like that , but that dont make you better than anybody else , not in my book . Hey , I didnt say that . Nor do I like being talked down to or called stupid by a guywho went to college , just cause hes got the jitters . Fellas , it doesnt even matter about the generator . The foodll keep without it . Kid , Im gonna start the motor , you raise the door , and you yell out when you got enough room . Yeah . Okay , good . Wait . This is ... You guys gonna let this kid risk his life over a generator that doesnt even matter ? Would you just shut the fuck up already ? Norm ! Listen , Mr. Drayton , I tell you what . The next time you got somethin to say , you count your teeth , because Im sick to death of your bullshit . All right ? Come on , Myron . This is crazy ! Leave em be . What am I , impugning their manhood or something ? Listen , theyve lost their sense of proportion . Whats going on here ? Out there in the market , theywere scared and confused . In here , theres a problem they can solve , so theyre goddamn gonna solve it . Ready , kid ? - Lets rock . Norm , come on . Dont , man . Its a mistake . Pussy . Go up ! So ... any boogeymen ? Pretty scary , aint it , Norm ? Yeah , right . Norm . Norm ! What the fuck ! Ahh ! Get it off ! Get it off ! Get this friggin thing off me ! Get it off ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Aah ! Aaahhh ! Jesus ! Theres more ! Theres more ! Somebody help me . Somebody help me . What the fuck are you waitin for ? Aaahhhh ! Hang on ! Aaahhhh ! Hold him still ! Hold him still ! Aaahhhh ! Oh , Jesus ! Aah ! Aah ! Shit ! Oh , shit ! Oh , shit ! David , its no good ! Aah ! Start the generator . Aah ! Aaaggghhh ! Gaaahhhh ! Hey , Im sorry . I mean , howthe ... howthe hell was I supposed to knowwhat you meant ? You said you heard something . Howwas I supposed to know what you meant ? You shouldve said what you meant better . I dont know , I thought maybe itwas a big bird or something . You got that kid killed ! Did you get a good look at it ? Huh ? Did you get a good look atwhat you did ? - Huh ? - David ! Dont hit him anymore ! Doesnt solve anything ! You two assholes , you got that kid killed ! And I got his fuckin blood on me ! Okay , Im done . Okay . Whats next ? Kill the generator . Thats the first thing . Im sorry . Jesus Christ ! Oh , God ! Im ... Im sorry about the kid . Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , God . We oughtta get out of here . Hey , we didnt twist his arm . Yeah , hes a fuckin kid . Hes supposed to be stupid . Whats your excuse , huh ? Get outta here . Go back in the market . Stay by the door . Dont say anything , to anybody . Not yet . Not yet . Shit . David ? Need a little light here . We have to tell em . The people in the market , we have to stop em going outside . Theywont believe us . They have to . Im not sure I believe it . I was here . W - whatwe sawwas impossible . You knowthat , dont you ? I mean , what ... what do we say ? How do we convince them ? Ollie , what the hell were those tentacles even attached to ? Oh , my God ! Are ... are you all right ? Shh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah , its not my blood . Im fine . W - what the hell happened ? llI explain . Give me a minute , okay ? I need to deal with something first . Please , Ive got to ... I cant let Billy see me like this . Hes scared enough . Just give me a minute . Keep him distracted . Okay ? Okay . Hey , look , Im sorry about Norm . Me too . I mean , I aint making excuses , Im just sayin . Look , we need to tell people . No need to say how itwent down or anything like that , but , uh , were in the deep shit here . People need to know . What about the out-of-towners ? We got plenty of them in the store . Where do we even start ? Brent Norton ? Thatwindbag ? Hes an important attorney in NewYork . That fellow could be on the bench one day . Counts a lotwith people of this town , or ... or anywhere . Yeah , thats right . - Do it quick , David . Weve got to discuss howwere gonna stop that thing getting in here . W - wait . What do you mean getting in ? You shut the loading door . Yeah , but the entire front of the store is plate glass . Jesus Christ . I was wondering where youd gotten to . Um , listen ... that guy that came in here , the one with the bloody nose theyre ... theyre ... We saw tentacles . Aint goin verywell , is it ? Unh-unh . - You ... what ? - Come here , youve got ... Come here . Tell him . Its true . Tentacles . Yeah . Um , gentlemen , um ... Im sorry , I ... Im just not that stupid . I mean , what do you take me for ? Im shocked . Im shocked . Im shocked . Its pretty tasteless using whats happening here to try to make me look like an idiot . No , no , thats not whats going on here . Look , come back to the loading dock , okay ? llI show you . Blood . A chunk of tentacle on ... on the floor . No . No ? What do you mean no ? No . Weve got real problems to deal with here , and this pathetic attempt at a joke has gone far enough . Mr. Norton , what reason could we possibly have ... ? Oh , please ! Please ! This is payback for the lawssuit that I filed against him last year , and you guys are backing him up . So winning wasnt enough , huh ? You wanted to humiliate me some more , show me a rubber snake while these ... these hicks stand around laughing their asses off . - Watch who you callin a hick ! - Myron ! Myron ! - Hey , hey , fuck ... ! Mr. Norton I swear , you have got us all wrong . Youre not too crazy about , um , out-of-towners , are you ? I only spend my money , and I pay my taxes here , and I have seen you talking behind my back . Yall stick together . Well , dont I feel foolish ? I actually thought you were being kind to me today , and , well , thanks for setting me straight . And Im glad that tree fell on your boathouse , you knowthat ? Glad . Smashed it in pretty good , didnt it ? Fantastic . Now , all of yall , just stay out of myway . I know youre scared , man . Im scared too . - Lives are at stake around here . - David ... Okay , my son 's life . Now , I need you . Brent , please , get your head out of your ass . All right , llI drag you back there if I have to . Come here . David , get your goddamn hands off of me ! llI sue your ass again ! Sue your ass , and this time youll go to jail ! This man assaulted me . He assaulted me . You were witness to it . This mans crazy . Hes crazy . No . He isnt . I wish he was , but he isnt . E - everyone in the store , you want to come back here ? Theres something you need to hear . It concerns you all . Okay . W - w-wait . I dont know what you people think youre doing . Youre drinking ? For Christs sake , Ollie . Do you want me to report you ? You want to lose your job ? Look , Im gonna be taking down names , starting with you . And I am prepared to file a police report . - Fine , Bud , write down your names . - I will . But in the meantime , shut the fuck up and listen . This is Mr. David Drayton . You need to hear what hes got to say if youre thinking about leaving . Go hang out with the ladies , all right ? Listen , dont be scared . Its okay . Okay . This is how it is . Now , I dont know what this mist is ... but there are things in it , and theyre dangerous , like Dan said . Thats right . Thats exactly right . What kind of things ? I never saw it . It happened too fast . I got knocked down . Five of us went back in the loading dock . Itwas Jim , Myron , Ollie ... me Norm , the bagboy . - We opened the door ... - Wheres Norm ? ... so Norm could go out and clear the vent for the generator . Something come out of the mist and took him . Took him ? What do you mean ? Just ... killed him . I mean dragged him off . Now , guys , I dont know what these things are . All we sawwere tentacles . Tentacles ? Tentacles , he says . Tentacles from Planet X. Its a lie , you know . I mean , all these people do is just lie each other up . Its a pile of shit . Of course its a lie . Of course its a lie . Its lunacy . From the look of it , the tentacles are coming out of the beer cans . All right , uh , Bud , dont take our word for it . Go look . Over there . What the hell is that ? It appears we may have a problem of some magnitude here . Yeah , just keep em in line . Thanks . Let me ... help these people . Let me ... let me preach your word . Let me shine your light , cause theyre not all bad . They cant all be bad . Some can be saved , cant they ? Yes . Some can be brought ... to heavens holy gates through your grace . I have to believe that , though I know mostwill swim in the lake of fire forever . If I can save a few ... even one then my life will have counted for something . I will have pulled myweight . I will have earned my place at your side . I will have served a purpose here on this earth . Hello ? What ? I just need to use the bathroom . Oh . Okay . Well , then , have at it . Maam ... I ... I justwant you to know that its okay ... being scared , I mean ... and , well , if you need a friend ... you know , someone to talk to . I have a friend ... God up above . I talk to him every day . Dont you condescend to me . Im sorry ? Not ever . You dont mock me . Thats notwhat I was doing . Well , llI tell you what ... the day I need a friend like you , llI just have myself a little squat and shit one out . Maybe you do believe this . Maybe theyre not lies , theyre delusions . Whatever . Uh , the fact remains , the evidence here is flimsy . - Its bordering on ludicrous . - Hey , this isnt a courtroom . Youre not arguing a case , and youre doing nothing but damage , talking the way you are . And you can throw as much cow 's blood around the loading dock as you want to . You still havent fooled anyone . Leave it alone , David . You cant convince some people theres a fire even when their hair is burning . Denial is a powerful thing . Well , keep talking . Ill have no part of it , nor would any thinking person . Keep thinking , Mr. Lawyer . Theres no defense against the will of God . Theres no court of appeals in hell . Theres no defense here , either . Not even with all the fertilizer in the world , not even if you stack it as high as you can . Its still just bags of shit , isnt it ? Those of you who want to discuss this thing rationally to find a means of rescue are welcome to join me . Those who want to stack dog food , knock yourselves out . We got those windowss taped up as bestwe could . It should help . Yeah , think so ? Duct tape and dog food bags . That bad ? Its not good . Theres none so blind as those who will not see . Open your eyes . Let the scales fall away . This has all been written . Revelations , chapter 15 : And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power , and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed . Well , what are you saying ? What are you proposing ? Thatwe all prepare ... to meet our Maker . Oh , prepare to meet shit ! Lady , your tongue must be hung in the middle so that it can waggle at both ends . The end time has come , not in flames , but in mist . Come here ! Easy ! Back off ! How about if your ass prepares to meet my size-10 work boot . How about that ? Hey , theres no call for that . Myron , please , calm your friend down . Im trying to save your soul , you stupid man . - Doubters will doubt till the end . - Its okay . No , Im sorry , Im sorry . A monstrosity did pull that poor boy away . Things in the mist ... do you doubt ? Do you ? Then go out . Go out and say , How do you do . Shut up , lady . For Gods sakes . Look , youll have to stop now . Youre scaring the children . They should be scared . Oh , yes , they should . Their beautiful , pure little minds have been corrupted with lies . Lies . All this talk of a modern God , or no God . There is one God . The God of the Israelites . And he is a stern and vengeful God , and we have been mocking him far too long , and now he demands retribution in blood . It is time to declare yourselves . Take sides ... the saved and the damned . Read the Good Book . It calls for expiation . - Blood ! - What ? Blood . Little Normie was first , and now God calls the rest of us . The bill is due . It must be paid . As Abraham prepared to sacrifice his only son to prove his love for God , so ... Enough . - Ohh . - Another down payment . A few more pennies in the jar . Now , thats nice , see . I cant smack her , but its okay for you . L - Im sorry everybody , but this ladys perspective is a little too Old Testament for my taste . Theyll come for you . Maybe tonight , when darkness comes . Theyll come tonight , and theyll take someone else . See if they dont . And when they do , you will cry to God , and you will beg Mother Carmody to show you the way . Thats fine . But until then , if you dont shut up , llI wrap this tape around your mouth . You just try it , Ollie Weeks . And you , bitch ... you hit me again ... if you dare . Youll be on your knees to me before this is through . Those of you who arent local should know that Mrs. Carmody is known in town for being ... unstable . No shit . Whatwas your first clue ? Shh . Hi . Whats up , little dude ? How come your friends dont come get us ? They got tanks and stuff , right ? Why cant you just call em ? Phones dontwork . But dont you got , like , a radio ? Hey , champ , whats going on ? I want their friends to come rescue us . Theywould if they could , pal . Theyre stuck here just like us . But ... Shh . Now , guys , we could use a hand over there . Yeah , sure thing . Troop , off your asses . You all right ? - I dont like that scary lady . Oh , man , I dont either . But you knowwhat ? Maybe shes scared too . You think ? You think Mommys okay ? Billy ... Im sorry about the times I was bad to her . Aw , hey . Mommy loves you very much . And llI bet shes fine . And I promise you , Im gonna do everything I can to get us back to her . - Okay ? - Kay . - Yeah ? - Kay . So , we can use the charcoal fluid and the mops to make torches . And weve got knives and stuff , God knowss . This may be a silly question , Bud , but ... do you happen to have a gun in the store ? Here ? No . Please . This ... this isnt Los Angeles . Ive got a shotgun in my truck . I could try for it if you want . Oh , God , I dont think thatd be a good idea , Mr. Cornell . Hold on . This gun , um ... my husbands idea . Hes away on business a lot . Its not even loaded . Aint much use unloaded , maam . Um ... You know howto use that ? Well , I shot it once on a pistol range . Hit the target a fewtimes . So , we got a gun . Anybody know howto shoot it ? Well , I mean ? I do . You ? Ollie . Please . Some target shooting . State champion in 94 . Youre crazy if you go out there ! Let us pass ! Let us pass , please ! Lets just talk this thing through . We have , and weve made our decision . Were leaving . Hey , Mr. Mackeys gonna barbecue some chicken on the gas grill . - Why dontwe just sit down and just ... - What , and let you keep on talking ? No , Ive been in far too many courtrooms to fall for that . Youve already psyched out half a dozen of my people already . Y , our people ? What kind of talk is that ? Theyre people , thats all . Now ... now listen , everyone . We are experiencing some kind of disaster . I dont knowwhether its manmade or natural , but I do knowthat its definitely not supernatural or biblical , and , no offense , Mrs. Carmody , but the onlyway were gonna help ourselves is to seek rescue . Were going out . - Brent , look . - Im not discussing this any further . I know . I justwant to ask a favor . Tie this around your waist . What for ? Itll let us know you got at least 300 feet . Ill do it . Are you throwing in with them ? Me ? No thanks . I think your man there is a little too tightlywound . Gonna get somebody killed . But Im thinkin we could use that shotgun of yours . I sawwhere you parked when I pulled in . Red pickup , right ? Far entrance ? Son , you got brass balls . The shells are in the glove compartment . Drive it back . All right . Just see theyre paying out this line . Lines up , llI cut her loose , just so you understand . Yeah . You sure theres no way I can talk you out of this ? David ... theres nothing out there . Nothing in the mist . What if youre wrong ? Then , I guess ... the joke would be on me after all . Were gonna send back help . Youll die out there . All of you . Hey , crazy lady , I believe in God too . I just dont think hes the bloodthirsty asshole you make him out to be . Well , you take that up with the devil when you run into him . You just chat it over at your leisure . Well , lets strike out toward the center of town . Keep it loose . Nice and easy . Keep going . Look . Its going . Theyre doing good . Aah ! Aaahhhh ! Put it down ! Ohh ! Pull ! Oh , my God ! Im slipping ! Pull ! Back up ! Back up ! Back up ! Get it off ! Oh , my God . Aw , sh ... Blood ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Cut the rope ! Shut the door ! Now do you see ? Now do you believe ? About a half-hour of daylight left . Guys , how 's it going with these work lights ? Were gettin em rigged up all right . Yeah , check it out . All right , all right . Save it , save it . These batteries aint topped up . You turn the lights on , its gonna drain em quick . How quick ? - Five minutes , maybe ten . - Yeah , if that . Okay , emergencies only . If something gets in the store . Holy Jesus , you scared the shit outta me . Oh , Sally , Im sorry , really . I thought Id come in and say hi and see how you were holding up . - Hi . - Hi . Barely . How about you ? Im worried about my folks , I guess . You know , they live up on Shorm Road . Thats less than five miles from here . How bout yours ? Well , theyre out of town right now . Theyre at my aunts in Boston , so ... Thats lucky . That means theyre okay . I hope so . So ... how soon you shipping out ? Uh , couple weeks . Scared about going over there ? Yeah . - Hey , Wayne ? - Hmm ? How come you never asked me out ? We flirted all through high school . I know you like me . So how come ? Im stupid , I guess . Oh , shit ! Im sorry . Dont be . I just ... I just didnt reallywant it to happen like this , you know ? Some shitty locker room atwork . Can we just stay in here a while , then ? I mean , just ... just you and me . The parking lot lamps turned on . Theyre on a timer . Must be a different one thats live .

Its just a bad dream . I want my mommy . I know . I know . Of course you do . - Shh . I wanna go home . Just sleep . Everythingll be better in the morning . Think he likes you . Well , I hate that I had to lie to him . You have kids ? No . I always wanted to , but ... things havent been working out . Right now Im thinking maybe thats for the best . I saw creatures fly into the store tonight that ... they shouldnt exist . I keep thinking Im gonna wake up in a rubber room . Youre not alone in that . Were all right there with you . This isnt gonna end , is it ? David . Its Joe . Hes getting worse . Joe . How you holdin up , partner ? David ... is that you ? Yeah , pal , how you doin ? Its bad . Hes bad . Didnt know anything could hurt like this . If you guys cant help me ... you ... you gotta end it , okay ? Ollies got that gun , right ? Right ? - No . No way . You cant fuck with me on this , bro . Notwith me like this . Ill do it . Just give me the gun . Hey , hey . Shh . - Were not there yet , okay ? - Oh , please ! Joe , now , listen . Pal ... were gonna work something out . I just need you to hang in a little longer , okay ? Can we do that ? Staywith him . Ill be back . Hattie , I need to go to the bathroom . Will you watch Billy ? Hattie . See anything ? The last of those bugs went away about four . Dawns coming . Whats on your mind ? Its Joe . We dont get him on some serious antibiotics , hes gonna die of infection . Plus he needs painkillers in the worstway . All ... all ... all we got here is liquor and aspirin . You ... you thinkin about goin to that pharmacy next door ? Irene Reppler says theyve got Silvadene ... you know , the stuff they use in burn wards . She knowss where they keep it . Slow down . You cant actually be thinkin of doin this . Im also thinkin beyond that . We have to get out of here . I mean permanently . Why ? We got plenty to eat ! What happens when one of those things decides to break through this window ? Im talkin one of the big ones , like the one that killed Norm . Yeah , and that flaming torch idea didntwork so well , did it ? We almost burned the goddamn store down . Its Hattie . Here ? All right , gently , now . Gently . One ... two ... three . I dont know how long she was there like that , lying there next to us . I thought she was sleeping . I got my 4-wheel drive . Its out there . Y - youre talking about leaving ? Well , we ... should hit the pharmacy first . We gotta bring back supplies for the injured . I mean , if we dont , Joe Eagletons gonna die , and we cant let that happen . But after that ... look , my Land Cruiser can hold eight people . I saywe drive south as far as the fuel takes us and try to get clear of this mist . Thats it ? Thats the plan ? - Thats what I got . - No , you cant mean it . Not after what happened to Norton and his group . No , no , no . Amanda , think . Norton got over 200 feet from this store . Thats how much rope played out . Im parked half that distance from here . Butwho knowss howfar this mist has spread ? It could be the entire eastern seaboard . Yeah , it could be the whole world , for all we know . Wouldnt make us any less dead , now , would it ? We have one gun . - How many rounds ? We got ten left . Ten rounds . Jesus . Okay , so ten . Want another reason to get the hell out of here ? llI give you the best one . Her . Mrs. Carmody . Shes our very own Jim Jones . Id like to leave before people start drinking the Kool-Aid . Hes right . Flakier people get , the better shes gonna look . No , I dont buy that . Its obvious shes nuts . Look , a few people maybe , but ... No , I count four . Shes preaching to em right now . By noon , shell have four more . By tomorrow night , when those things come back , shell have a congregation , and then we can startworryin aboutwho shes gonna sacrifice to make it all better . Hmm ? You , Amanda ? My little boy ? Hes right . You dont have much faith in humanity , do you ? None whatsoever . I cant accept that . People are basically good , decent . My God , David , were a civilized society . Sure , as long as the machines are workin and you can dial 9-1-1 , but you take those things away , you throw people in the dark , you scare the shit out of them , no more rules , youll see how primitive they get . You scare people badly enough , you can get em to do anything . Theyll turn to whoever promises a solution , or whatever . Ollie , please , back me up here . I wish I could . As a species , were fundamentally insane . Put more than two of us in a room , we pick sides and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another . Why do you think we invented politics and religion ? Oh , Jesus , thats just ... wrong Look , nobody has to decide anything now , okay ? First things first ... the pharmacy . Thatll be our test run . Okay ? Its all right , Big Bill . Im gonna bring you back some comic books . I dontwant them . I want you to stay here . I wont be gone long . Just ... just next door . Hey , youll be safe . Daddy ... Daddy , there are things out there . Things ... Yeah . Theres a lot less of em in the daytime . Theyll wait . Theyll wait in the mist where you cant see em , and then when you go and cant get back in ... theyll come and eat you up ! - Shh . - Daddy , dont go ! llI be back . Big Bill ... I promise . Ill be back , and then Im gonna take you home . All right ? Together , were going home . If something happens , anything at all , you cut and run . You get your ass back in here , for your boys sake . If something happens to me , I want you to take care of Billy ... best as you can , and long as you can . Land Cruisers yours now . You ... you get him out of here . You just keep drivin . Where do you think youre going , Mr. David Drayton ? Are you so anxious to make your boy an orphan ? My boy is no concern of yours . Listen up . Were going to the pharmacy . Were gonna bring back some supplies . Also , there may be people trapped over there who need help . Listen , folks , listen ! Were not gonna take any chances . If theres any trouble , well come straight back here to the supermarket . And bring the fiends of hell down on our heads , thank you . Shes right . Youll make em notice us . Youll make em come . Why cant you just leave well enough alone ? Lady , this what you call 'well enough ? You wanna stop us ? You better explain to Bobby here whywere not bringin painkillers and medicine back for his brother . Im goin , even if I have to go alone . Youll die out there , young man . Youll walk out that door and be torn to shreds , and then your hell-bound pride will have them come get the rest of us . Yes , theyll come back for all of us , just like this good lady said . Do you want that to happen , people ? No ! No ! No ! No ! Well , it is this kind of hubris that brought the wrath of God in the first place . This kind of pride and defiance of ... Shut up , you miserable buzzard ! You old bitch ! Stoning people who piss you off is perfectly okay . They do it in the Bible , dont they ? And I got lots of peas . David , please , if you want to go , now 's the time . How bout it , Army ? Any help from the armed forces ? llI go . Jim Grondin . I had you in school , didnt I ? Yesm , me and my sister Pauline .

 Previously on Heroes ... You stuck your nose where it didn 't belong . So did you . Well , you stole something from me . - You mean this ? - Get- - Why are you doing this ? I work for a guy , I find stuff , he pays me . Where is Kaito 's part of the formula ? So the formula is gone . Someone is manipulating us . Someone powerful . And they must be stopped . I will find them and stop them . Actually , you 're the only one who can . What was that all about ? That was about buying some time . Meet your new partner . Am I been replaced ? Just until I find his weakness and then I 'm gonna kill him . I have seen the future Gabriel . I have seen how important you are . I don 't believe you can master your urges . My ability is not just understanding how things work . There 's a hunger . I couldn 't control it , it had turned me into a killer . You have it now . What did you do to me ? DNA manipulation . I 've hurt people you need to take it away . I can 't . You 're just gonna have to trust me , Nathan . You must help her . It 's all happening so fast . My life is a speeding train . and I 'm not sure where it 's headed . But one thing is certain . I have been given a second chance . Touched by god . And I 've got to believe that he has a purpose for my life . So why am I filled with self-doubt ? Plagued by demons real and imaginary ? Frightened by the challenges ahead ... and haunted by the ghosts of my past ? Does god know what I am ? Do I ? Am I an angel or a monster ? A hero or a villain ? And why can 't I see the difference ? Did I startle you ? Drink ? That 's right . Because you 're not really here , are you ? Whatever makes you happy , Nathan . You know what would make me happy ? Some straight answers . Like how you knew she was in trouble . You mean Tracy . You said she needed my help that she was my path . Next thing I know , she 's taking a header into the Potomac . And you were there to save her . Now I suppose you 're wondering why . I mean , was it luck ? Was it coincidence ? Or perhaps guidance from a higher power . You 're not a messenger from god . Moses saw a burning bush . Mary heard the angel . God came to Samuel in his dreams . And I 've got a dead mobster telling me he 's the voice of god . You think the answers to your questions are somehow outside of you , Nathan . But ... God resides within . The answers will come . Nathan ? Who are you talking to ? Nobody . Just clearing my head . Yo , what up ? What you need ? What do you got ? White lightning , base , angel dust . No , I need something to take the edge off . All right . I got just the thing . I don 't need your drugs . I need you . You have the hunger . You 're just like me . I will never let myself become you . You already are . - Brother . - No ! I can 't be you . Peter , stop ! You don 't know what you 're- - You don 't know what you 're doing . I know ... exactly what I 'm doing . When were you gonna tell me that Sylar 's my brother ? What other secrets are you hiding from me , mother ? Tell me your secrets ! Or I 'll rip open your head and I 'll take ' em out myself . No ! Are you okay ? Is he gonna be all right ? Yes . I 'll make sure of it . We got a lead on a new target . You want me to come with you . Don 't make this harder than it already is . Oh , god . Oh , god . Sandra ? Crap . What 's going on ? Claire lied . There was no cheerleading retreat . Now she 's not answering her cell . I 'm so dang stupid . She 's obviously gone after one of them . That 's all she 's been talking about wanting to help , no thanks to you . Okay , calm down . How can I be calm ? Look at them . They 're monsters . Claire can 't get hurt , remember ? Oh , no ? How about this guy ? Stephen Canfield . He creates Vortexes . Makes people disappear forever . Even Claire . All right , we 'll find her . Oh , no . What is it , Meredith ? We just better hope it 's not him . Why ? Who is he ? His name 's Eric Doyle . He 's a horrible man . You don 't even want to know . No , his place isn 't too far from here . I 'm gonna start by looking for her there . I 'm coming with you . Sandra . She 's my daughter . Can you do this ? I 'll have Claire home before you know it . You think I wanted to leave my family ? I had no choice . Just tell me where they are . You 're her sister . Damn it , you know where she is . I got the right to see her and my kids . Hello ? Is someone there ? Behind you . Got you . I need ... your ... help . My help ? You buried me alive . Why in bloody hell would I help you ? Let me out of here ! You sawed off little Japanese cretin . I will give you another chance If you behave . Okay ? Okay . We are searching for a formula that- - Formula ? Heh ! I knew it would come back to bite them in the ass someday . Even I told them to destroy it . So you know who would steal it ? Maybe . If I tell you , what 's in it for me ? When we finish our mission ... I promise to put you in a more spacious cell . - With a window . - And a vent . - Forget it . - Okay , back you go . Wait ! You little Japanese Nazi ! Let me think . Just off the top of my head I 'd say your villain is Angela Petrelli . She asked us to find the formula . I see . Well , I 'm fresh out of ideas . Fine . Wait ! I know how to find your big villain . And get you your formula . I have a plan . Na ? How do you feel about recruiting ? Recruiting for what ? An organization for a new world order . Daphne , you and I are standing on the precipice ... for real change . A world where people like you are embraced . Your gifts acknowledged and respected , not ignored . I mean , you 'd like to be part of a world where you can really be somebody , wouldn 't you ? As long as I get paid . What do I have to do ? There are others like you out there . Just invite them to join us . Everything you need to know is right here . These are some pretty nasty people . I don 't like getting my hands dirty . They 've merely lost their way . It 's time for us to give them purpose . Just ... sit . Just so you know , this was her idea , not mine . You mean my mother ? If it was up to me , I 'd have left you to rot . No forgiveness , is that it ? You terrorized my daughter . You killed countless others , including a target that had valuable information . Rehabilitation doesn 't happen overnight . I am trying . I understand . Killing is just in your nature . What 's going on ? What do you think ? I 'm bringing you back to level five where you belong . Please , don 't do this . I need to find my family . From the looks of things , they 're long gone . What do you expect ? Your company dragged me away in the middle of the night . I didn 't even get to say good-bye . They put me away for almost two years . My family must think I abandoned them . That 's what happens to people like you . They put you away so the rest of us can be safe . I made one mistake . You 're like the others . So quick to judge . - You want to believe I 'm a monster . - You killed someone . You are a monster . You 're wrong . And you need to listen . Mohinder ? Hey , there . You didn 't come home last night . What 's this ? A flyer . It was stuck in your door . Did you know your neighbor was missing ? I 'm getting closer , you know . This next stage in my research ... It could be the answer to taking away your ability . I can make you happy , Maya . I ... should let you get back to it . Your company has got it all wrong . I never meant to hurt anyone . Who 's this ? Your partner ? I don 't have a partner . What are you talking about ? " One of us , one of them , " right ? Company policy . You 're not with the company , are you ? Are you with them ? Who the hell are you ? Come in here and shoot me , hold me hostage . You know about me . I read your file . You killed a man . That was an accident ! Your neighbor , right ? Over what ? A broken lawnmower ? We got into an argument . It got heated . I overreacted . Next thing I knew , he was gone . I didn 't want to hurt him . They locked me away . No lawyer , no trial . I love my wife . I love my children . I just want to see ' em again . Hold them . Even if it 's for the last time . I just want to be normal . You don 't understand . Now just ... just go . You 're ... letting me go ? Yeah . Just give me a head start before you call your friends at the company . Maybe I can help . You tried to kill yourself . How do I know you 're not gonna do it again ? What do you want from me , Nathan ? Undying gratitude ? Thanks . You 're my hero . I want to know what you were doing on that bridge . I can 't talk about it . Why not ? Who 's gonna understand better than I am ? Just tell me . What happened ? I killed someone . Who ? A reporter . He threatened to run a story ... saying that I was Niki sanders . When there was no way that I could reason with him ... I got ... I got angry . I reached out to grab him froze him . He shattered . It was an accident , Tracy . I need to turn myself in . That 's probably not a good idea . What are you gonna tell them , Tracy ? Who 's gonna believe you ? I can fly , but I can 't talk about it . Well , then I 'll show them . You can 't do that . Listen , I 've been there . I understand . I- - I wanted to tell the world . I even called a press conference . What happened ? I got shot . I died . And then I saw god . And I truly believe with all my heart that he 's got a higher purpose for us . You think god gave us these powers ? If he didn 't , who did ? A doctor in Reseda , California . This is the last number the company has for them . It 's the same area code , so they can 't have gone far . Thanks , Claire . For everything . Hi , baby . It 's me . Wait , don 't hang up . Look , I know you 're scared ... but , uh , I love you . I need to see you and the kids . Well , then meet me , anywhere . The Griffith Park carousel . Great . Man , I can 't wait- - - What happened ? - We were cut off . - Claire ? - Dad ? He 's your father ? You set me up ? No , I swear . Back off ! Drop the gun . Let go of the girl ! Sylar . Dad , what is he doing here ? Let her go , Canfield . You don 't stand a chance . Stand back . Last warning . I didn 't know . I 'm sorry . It 's not over yet . Hold on to something . Stand back , I will shoot ! Hold on , Claire . Claire , hold on . Dad ! Help ! Dad , help ! Claire ! Don 't let go . Dad ! You okay ? Peachy . Oh , thank god . You okay ? Target 's gone . Well , he can 't be far . Claire . Where did Mr. Canfield go ? Leave him alone . He doesn 't want to hurt anyone . This isn 't a game . He 's very dangerous . Who are you to talk ? Bringing him here ? Tell me you 're not working with him after what he did to me . Claire , you hate me . I understand . When I touched your hand ... I could feel the pain that I caused you ... and I never meant for you- - Shut your mouth now . You don 't get to talk to her . Ever . Look ... we 'll talk more about this when we get home ... but right now you have to tell me where Mr. Canfield went . He 's not a killer . He 's having problems like I had problems . He just- - he didn 't have you to help him . All right . Okay , then just ... Let me talk to him . If what you say is true we 'll make other arrangements . You can trust me , Claire . I wouldn 't send anybody to level five that doesn 't belong there . He 's at the Griffith Park carousel . This is your plan ? Go to a bar ? I haven 't had a drink in months and they make a mean appletini . I 'm warning you , Adam Monroe . I 'll pop you right back into your coffin . Relax . You said the speedster girl was hired , right ? Well , this bar is the go to destination of specials for hire . - Specials for hire ? - That 's right . - Ooh , like the cantina . - Yeah . I never knew there was such a place . Can we find out who hired the speedster ? That 's why we 're here . Just leave everything to me . And try and ... Look tough . Barkeep , the usual ... and make it snappy . Hello , Milosh . How dare you come in here ? Look , I didn 't know she was your wife . And for the record , she never mentioned it . What happened to Peter ? I put him in a medically induced coma . What ? Your brother tried to kill me . Why ? He took Sylar 's ability ... and now he 's suffering the consequences . We 're in a lot of trouble , Nathan . Mom , it 's Tracy Strauss . Tracy , my mom . I know who she is . And why she 's come . I heard you saw Dr. Zimmerman . How do you know Dr. Zimmerman ? He worked for the Company many years ago in research and development . Very bright . Then you understand what he did to me . You can help me . No , I 'm afraid that 's not possible . His work was classified . You want me to go public with this ? What are you hiding , mom ? Zimmerman was instrumental in the company 's development of synthetic abilities . Synthetic . We used the technology on a number of infants . You were one of them , Tracy . As were your sisters , Niki and Barbara . And you , Nathan . We gave you your ability too . God ... What have you done ? Oh ... my ... God ! Gotta get you out . Maya ! I know you 're in here . You have to control your power . You don 't want to be a killer again , do you ? What have you done ? You 're ... a monster . I wish you hadn 't said that . It 's done . What do you want me to do about the two Japanese guys ? It 's all here . The testing , the experimentation . Everything they did to us . It wasn 't god . We were trying to be better than god . How ? By using people as ... lab rats ? Your own son . Your father was disappointed that you weren 't born with the genetic code . But we thought because of your lineage your system could handle it . And obviously we were right . Then what about me ? My parents were dead . I had no one to protect me . Tracy , what this company did to you in the name of science was wrong . We know that now . And that is why we divided the formula and hid it so this would never happen again . An innocent man is dead because of what you did to me . Then help me . Because someone has stolen the formula . They want to restart this project . They want to create a world filled with dangerous people . Deadly , out of control . They will destroy everything . Please help me stop them . Go to hell . Nathan , it 's why Peter took Sylar 's ability . It 's why- - It 's why he sacrificed himself . He knows what 's gonna happen to this world . You do not understand . I understand , Ma . I understand . You locked Peter up . Put a shunt in his head . You did experiments on me . And god knows who else . Peter ? Claire ? Who else did you use as your own personal guinea pig ? Nathan , listen to me . Nathan . I 'm sorry . What 's next ? I know a scientist . He understands all of this genetic stuff . If anybody can help you , he can . - Can he be trusted ? - Suresh ? Yeah , he 's harmless . Stephen ? It 's Claire . I talked to my dad . He said he 's willing to listen . It doesn 't matter anymore . What happened ? They never showed up . You were right , Claire . My wife ... my kids ... They 're afraid of me . Maybe I am a monster . Couldn 't put it better . - Dad , what are you doing ? - It 's all right . We 're just talking . I 'll make you a deal , Stephen . My partner is standing right over there by my car . You make him disappear and this is all over . I don 't understand . You want me to kill your partner ? Do it , and I 'll let you go . I give you my word . What are you saying ? You do not have to do this . Stay out of this , Claire . She 's right , I can 't . I 'm not a killer . Maybe not . But he is . And he needs to be destroyed . Unfortunately , I can 't do it . Please , I just- - I 'm not asking . Dad , no ! I 'm doing this for us , Claire . For what Sylar did to you . You people ... You 've taken everything from me . Do it . Kill him now ! What are you doing ? I won 't be a monster . No ! Hello , boys . Nemesis . So ... my friend here . Tells me that you 're looking for work . And I said , that 's not possible . Those goody two-shoes . We heard about what you are doing . Sign us up . I 'm not convinced . We have changed . We are badasses now . Yes , we are very badass . When do we start ? Not so fast . You have to prove yourself worthy . How do we do that ? You 're the one with the powers ? Yes . I control time and space . Cool . Kill the other one . Kill Ando ? Yeah , he has no powers . What good is he to us ? You kill him , you are badass . I 'm sorry , my friend . I must make some sacrifices to save the world . Hiro . We 'll talk more when I come home , okay ? Claire , wait . I know you 're- - you 're disappointed ... but I did what I had to do ... for us . She doesn 't believe a word you 're saying . She knows exactly what you did back there why didn 't take down Stephen Canfield when you had the chance . Nobody 's talking to you . Claire finally sees you for what you are- - a user . Isn 't that right , Claire ? You used her to try to find that poor man . Then you used him to try to kill me because to you . I 'm nothing but a monster . He doesn 't see our humanity , Claire . He never will . Claire , wait . You 're not gonna listen to him , are you ? The man is a deranged sociopath . - He 's a killer . - He 's a monster . Yes . And you are my daughter . And everything I do ... is to protect you . To protect this family . Tell me you understand that . I understand . It 's all gonna be okay . I promise . Mom . Claire ! Thank god . I was so worried . Are you okay ? 'cause if you are , you are so grounded . I 'm sorry . I 'm just glad Meredith found you . Meredith ? Enjoying your dinner , my dear ? Eat . Now ... give me a sweet kiss . Go to hell , you filthy- - ah ! My god . Peter , tell me you didn 't do this , please . Hello , Angela . No ... it can 't be . You can see the future . I can 't have that . It 's too dangerous . No , you won 't succeed . I 'll stop you . Don 't be ridiculous . You won 't even be able to move . You won 't even be able to move . You 're late . Have you completed your task ? They 're onboard . Even the Japanese guy . Look , I 'm not happy about what happened . That 's not what I signed up for . I 'm not a killer . It 's all part of making the world a better place , Daphne . No pain , no gain . There 's another one ... You 're going to have to recruit . I 'm afraid he 's going to be the most difficult . Matt Parkman ? What 's his thing ? He has the ability to alter your mind . Put thoughts into your head . Make you see things that aren 't there . Speaking of which ... I finally figured out what 's been bugging me about you . I 'm fast . Real fast . I can sneak up on everybody . I can 't sneak up on you . I knew it ! You 're not really there . It 's not your concern , Daphne . Just bring me Parkman . Guess I don 't really have a choice , do I ? The team is coming together nicely . Everything went fine . Perfect with Nathan . I messed with his head . I gave him visions of Linderman just like you asked . Now he thinks he 's doing god 's work . Yes . Very real . Daphne is spreading the word . We 're building an army , just like you- - Sorry . Knox called just a few minutes ago . He 'll have Adam Monroe here by tomorrow . Right . Absolutely . Whatever you say goes , Mr. Petrelli .

Where we supposed to get together tonight ? It doesn 't matter . Thank god you 're here cause I can 't get my stupid key ... What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . Who are you ? I have a hell of a day , allright . All I want is a couple of tight and all and ... And a dozen glasses of wine . Look miss I ... I really don 't have time for this . Brian it 's not funny .

I hope someone has an explanation because I 've no idea what the ... Joe , it 's me Jane . I don 't want no trouble . So just get the hell out of here and leave me alone . I need some answers Joe . What the hell is going on here ? I 'll shoot . I 'll do it . Go ahead . We both now I 'll heal . Andre talk to me . Tell me you know who I am . Jane , listento me . They shut down NYCO . They 're distoying any evidence of the team existence . Joe has been reprogramed to kill Connor and Riley . They 're getting close to me . It 's just a matter of time before they find you . Why is this happening ? There 's got to be ... ANDRE ! présente Painkiller Jane saison 1 épisode 16 : Thanks for the memories . You tell me . Should I be paranoid right now ? Most of my team has been assassinated . Joe has been brain washed . And I can 't even begin to understand what 's going on with my boyfriend . Oh yeah , I 'm also about to be offed . I hate that word " offed " . I hate the concept even more . Andre says they 're trying to wipe out any trace of the unit and what we do . I can 't let that happen . Since I don 't have any time to write my memoirs , I 've got to find a way and fast ... Which is why I am thinking about Simon . Well , I suppose I should be flattered . an entire team , the best of the best , devoted to following and finding pepole like me . Your friend Riley ... His mind is a vault of information . Neuros . That 's what you call us . At least i 'm glad to know i 'm not alone in my ... Uniqueness . Today is your lucky day , pal . 'Cause I 'm about to arrange for you to meet the rest of the freaks so you won 't feel so lonely . If you ever want to see your friend again , intact , that might not be the wisest thing to do . Wait ! Let 's hear him out . We don 't know if anyone can restore riley 's memory . I can . I can steal knowledge . I can transfer knowledge . And I can restore knowledge . It 's Jane Vasco . I need to see you . This 71 Latour shoudl be savored . Not coped . Savoring is not my life right now . I don 't know if ... Life is even my life right now . Why are you here Jane ? My team has been taking out . And I 'm supposed to be next . If that happens ... The world would never know . About us ? About what you did to us ? For good or bad , there needs to be a record . I thought you were here to chip me . You 're here for me to pick your brain . Yes . Well , you realize that ... That you 're dying I know . But I still think you can get the story down ... And put it somewhere safe . Are you willing to help me ? Yes . I 'll help you . Okay , so ... How exactly does this work ? Take my hands . Okay . Just in vision your experiences But there 's so many ... Well ... Start at the beginning . Have a seat . Your current investigation has been terminated by the director . Why ? She chose not to share that with me , agent Vasco . I could use you on my team . Only I don 't know what your team does , do I ? We hunt Neuros . Neurological aberrates . 6 years ago the governement became aware of a genetic aberration appearing within the population . Those are the aberration that possess unique to influence others . Welcome to the freak show . Someone has been dealing substandard medication on the black market . We believe there 's a Neuro behind the operation The drugs in question are made and manufactured by Vonotek . So we got to go back in ? Yes . But not solo . I want you and Jane inside . You can play tag with Hyde and watch each other 's back . As long I 'll take the head of security . Report to security on floor 1-14 . Take the express elevator . Blue one 's Hyde , Jane 's on him . Just landed on the 46th floor . Steve ! What the hell are you doing ? Why am I not dead ? Agent Vasco just survived a 46 story fall . Lacerations , contusions , internal organ damage . She doesn 't have any . Not even a scratch . Could she be ... No . Nothing in her blood work , tissue samples or brain scan indicate anything related to what we 're dealing with . Listen to me . Whatever the hell is going on with me ... I really need to know what it is . Okay ? I 'll find answers for you Jane . You have my word . Despite the differences , we 've discovered a definable pattern in her gene code . This aberration seems to affect the neuroligical center of the frontal cerebral cortex . We 've accounter dozens of variations . In how many people ? To date , almost 200 . What the hell are you talking about ? Obviously a Neuro that can raise people from the dead . Obviously ... I came up with a least a dozen other cases of corpses missing from graveyards All within the last nine weeks . They 're all young . And hot . I didn 't hurt anybody . You know this isn 't right . You have to make it stop . It 's none of your business . I know all about being lonely , Eric . I bet this all started after Albert died . Albrt 's my friend . And you missed him . And you were lonely . Come on . Why don 't you chip the little bastard ? I can 't get a clean shot without hitting Vasco . Just dial the range on that dart for 3 feet beyond her . It 'll pass right through her . Sorry girl . Eric you 're gonna be okay . Allright , nobody 's going to hurt you . You 're gonna be okay . Let 's go kiddo . Where are you taking me ? I didn 't hurt anybody . It 's gonna be okay . What 's wrong ? Where would you have taking me if you hadn 't let me here ? To an internment center . Internment center ... It isn 't like that . What is it like , Jane ? Have you seen it yourself ? No , but I 've ... Been assured that ... Assured by who ? The people who have killed your team . The people who are hunting you down . You can 't die on me now . You can 't . Maybe this was to much . No . I am so sorry . Yes . You should be . The intent ... Was to protect the public from danger . Then just what is your interpretation of danger I wonder ? I wish I could show you . Why can 't you ? At least cause of the heart attack episode you just had . Oh , I 'll be just fine . You 're savoring . I 'll try to remember that the next time I 'll do heart medication . They all knew one other , they all worked together , now they are all dead . What happened to them ? They died of old age . These women where all healthy one minute , and rapidely extend dead the next . I think we 'll have to investigate this from the inside . The only way I can get into this dress is if I had it painted on . Demarco designs his dress for girls with single digit bmis . You 're just too healthy . Good luck . People opinion is running pretty high ? People wants someone to blame . There is someone to blame : a pyromaniac neuro . Richard don 't ! The hell with you ! Seem to be dealing with a neuro who can induce persistent visual hallucinations in his victims . Connor . The last time we saw you we left you to question Marty Langton . The next thing you 're in here guns blazing . The neuro must have got to him back at the factory when he left with Marty . Connor ! What are you doing man ? It 's okay , it 's okay . It 's Jane . I still become in my head . Yes . They were unpleasant people . It looks like saying Hitler had issues . Simon , these people were a danger to society They were a danger to themselves . I mean , you saw what I saw . They had to be stopped . They had to be stopped . So , We gathered all the people together , good or bad hunted them down and chip them off . I didn 't know it was grey . But you went along with it . Not always . The man is Ethan Grant . No criminal record , no nothing . He told the police that he saw the plane crashed before it happened . There was no other evidence connecting him to it . But there were other calls , right ? The voice print from his call to the airline matches 3 others from the past 6 months , warning people about bad things that were going to happen : a gas main explosion , a fire at an elementary school , and get this ... A tornado that touched down near Amarillo , Texas . Okay , well , you heard that the man said , If he 's right , and so far you say he has been then three of you will die . That 's if you actually believe that someone can see the future . Even if i don 't , why risk it ? He hasn 't committed any crime . He 's only been trying to save people 's lives . So far , yes . But if he is a neuro and if he can see the future , you have to wonder what else he could do . Why assume he 's trying to hurt anyone ? Because he can . Traditional law enforcement can 't handle him . That power makes him and every other neuro our problem . Even if it 's cost us our lives . Let 's leave this one alone Andre . Is he still in custody ? No . They had to release him . Way to go Feds . That 's the address where they picked him up . The house is own by his sister Sarah . Allo ? Ethan ? Keep him on . Riley , you got that ? I need a trace . You got it . He says to tell to the 2 agents sitting in my living room that there 's going to be a terrible accident . 11 people will die . He 's saying that they 're not going to listen to him . Maybe they 'll listen to you . You have to let this one go Andre . Can 't do it Jane , you know that . He goes through what we just went through every time he sees a disaster coming . Now you want to act like one of the governement fugs that he is afraid of and hunt him down . But that is just it . Maybe we can help him . So far we 're doing a bang-up job . I mean with his visions . If he is a neuro , we chip him . Give him some peace . Unless you want him to deal with this for the rest of his life . No , you think ethan is some ticking bomb who needs to be defused . You don 't care about helping him . You do . I think we 've got a second neuro . Hit our SUV this morning , hit us at the marina this afternoon I got him . What are you saying ? We 've some lunatic neuro stalking the team ? It 's starting to look that way . It needed access to our intel . They 've got that . A leak ? Holly ! I would never do anything to put this team in danger . You would never do anything consciously . I 've discovered how Joseph 's healing ability works . Jane , you have more than once voice , you doubt about what it is we have to do . Let 's be franc . On several occasions you 've deliberately disobey my orders . We believe that , Joseph 's energy affected you all your mind in such a way that your doubts began to manifeste themselves . And they started to work against the team . I don 't believe that . No I didn 't think you would . I don 't blame you . But it 's clear you 've become a liability . Now , I would prefer not to have to restrain you . Convincing enough for you ? Open up , open up ! I wasn 't expecting anyone . This should be interesting . They 're about to find me . And try to kill me . Only ... Have yet to be killed . It 's not that I , can 't be , it 's just that I haven 't yet . Which , makes the question : what are they gonna do to me to achieve their goal . And , hum ... How much is it going to hurt ? What the hell are you doing ? Something where they trust to take . What are you talking about ? Take with us where ? Don 't forget to shut the door . I figure they 'd been here . They wouldn 't think I 'd be stupid enough to come back , so ... We 're probably safe here for a while . I thought you said Brian was here . He was . They were . Maybe they took them . I 've no idea . What 's Jane 113 ? Jane 113 . What 's that ? We should continue . Yes . Than we can find a cox cure . What are you thinking about now , Jane ? As quickly as you heal there are aspects of your genetic structure that are out of the lead . I 'm really going to hate this . Don 't ask me if i 'm okay .. I I know what you 're trying to do but I won 't turn Elyse over to you . I know what they can do here . I 've seen them cure people like elyse . I know what they 've done for me . You ? Oh God ! Oh God ! Oh god ! You tell me . Are you willing to take a chance on a miracle ? Mo ! Hey Jo ! Get out of here ! All I know is it hurt like hell . Hum sorry . You can put this on , your shirt is pretty much toasted So if my brain controls my healing , I should be able to turn the healing off . Confused right ? I 'm dead . So just keep on doing what you 're doing . Pretend I 'm not even here . Or am I ? Seeing is believing it , isn 't it ? I know how difficult it 's been for you . But you have to see the wonder in it , Jane . What if there 's a way someday to use it to help others ? Cancer patients ? Terminal children ? My team ? They were good people Simon . I know you don 't think so . I 've never said that . The world needs to know about them too . So do you . I 've spent a lot of money training me . I 'm very good at what I do . I can approach a man from 100 metres and he 'll never hear me coming . Are you okay ? Yeah . My boots are worst than my ears . Connor ! Hand me that gun . Slowly . How are you doing ? Agains the fence with her . You 'll be dead before your head hit the knob . I 'm a federal officer . I ... Allright , pal . Let 's see how much of a risk you 're willing to take . You found the neuro ? Yeah , I 'm with him right now . Good work Riley . Et ... I 'm on ... And I am the best . Crap ... Hum ... There was no answer when I knocked , I just ... I thought I heard some noises , I thought maybe there might be something wrong . So you picked the lock ? It wasn 't all that difficult . What are you doing here riley ? Who the heck goes in the basement alone ? Nice hardware ! You 're damn right ! Oh , you mean the bike . Can you live with yourself now ? Yeah ... I can live with myself . Case close , son of a bitch ! Football ! Didn 't you were into that game . You play ? She 's talking about the palyers . You take the other one . No ! Wait ! D.E.A. ! Hands up ! My pen won 't work . You 'd think the mayor 's office would have a pen that would work . Hold it ! I wouldn 't do that if I were you Sheriff . Just put it down . That 's might change your mind . But I ... I chiped him . How often ... Do you trust your life ... To a friend . I trusted my life to Maureen ... Everyday . And when she died , she was part of a team that had her too . We did our best . All of us . She knew that . We 'll miss her . I 'll really miss her What the hell is going on Brian ? Look , I can 't explain right now . Meet me at the subway platform . Which one ? You know what I 'm talking about Jane . Brought a weird chump hat . Really ? Just trust me . Please . That was Brian . He wants me to meet him at the subway . He 's not supposed to know about the subway . Then again , he 's ... Not supposed to be married with children and ... Living in my apartment either ... Jane , can you trust him ? I don 't know . We had a good relationship . I thought ... Show me . I 'm a grown woman . I can take it . So go on . Hit me with your best shot ! Come on . Duty calls . Yeah , something like that . But I promise , I 'll make it up to you . That I 'm looking forward to . Brian ? What are you doing here ? Do you want to try that again , but this time with ... Brian , hey ! This is great ! I thought you were out of town and I 'm so happy that you came back a day early just to see me . I don 't know what to think . But you 're thinking of going to meet him . Jane it 's hard not to let our emotional attentions cloudered our judgements . What are my options ? Go on the run and living hiding forever . No offense but , I wanna know the truth . I tried to run away before and ... escaped the inevitable . It didn 't work . Agent Vasco . I 'm not even sure who you 're an agent with , but i know that in 3 days , you , your team , will try to arrest me . Things won 't go well . Your 3 team mates will be killed . And you will shoot me . I 'll die in front of the orange door . You 're afraid to go after this guy ? You 're the one who should be afraid . According to him , I 'm making out of this . Maybe we don 't have a choice . Haven 't his experiences and ours prove that we can 't change the outcome . Nobody controls my destiny but me . Agent Vasco ? Ethan where are you ? I know you would come here . I saw it . I believe you . And I believe your premonitions about me and my team . How do I stop it ? Sorry . I just stopped by Jane 's place . There 's some clothes and a suitcase missing . But she left her locator behind . Okay . Would somebedy please tell me what the hell is going on in here ? Jane is still trying to change the future Ethan Grant predicted . By leaving town ? Right now , she 's probably trying to get as far away from ethan , the tosrona factory , and us as possible . Without her , the premonition can 't play out the way he saw it . Allright . I saw movement in the north-west corner . This is going down . It won 't be what he predicted not without Vasco . Let 's find out . Connor ! Bauer , why don 't you lay down some fire . Don 't worry Andre . I 'm gonna get you out of here . How bad is it ? What the ? Oh ! That one really hurt ! But I saw Andre died . I drugged Connor and Andre . But ... Don 't you understand ? I died in their place . You 're trying to fake out fate ? Who says it 's a fake-out ? Maybe this is exactly what Ethan saw , and he only interpreted it as seeing three different people die . But I saw my own death . You shouldn 't believe everything you see . Come on . Watch it ! You can 't stop fate . No one can . It 's like a living thing . It swallows us all in the darkness . No matter what happens ... I promise , your story will be told . Thank you . Joe . Whatever they did , or whatever they threatened you with , I understand . I just want you to be okay . Brian ? Do exactly as I tell you . You won 't heal from this . Trust me . Why ? Brian ... Be quiet . Please tell me ... There 's something making you do this , or was it always a lie ? Don 't ... Jane ! Are you allright ? What the hell is happening ? You 're fine , look at me . I was just sorting some tests . I had to sedate you . How long have I been out ? Just for a couple of hours . The anaesthetic I gave you should have been keept you out for longer . Are you sure you 're okay ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . I just ... I need to get up . This is interesting . Check this out . She downed by the pier , jumped off , nobody saw her surface . This one , she was down by the aquadote . And she just ... Disepeared . So what do we have ? Some fish neuro who can breath under water ? Let 's get your scuba gear ready . Yeah we 're all good . Check spear gun . Waow . Sleeping beauty awakes . And I didn 't even get a chance to kiss her . What ? No frog jokes ? You 're all ... Alive . Right ? I 've never thought I 'd be so happy to see you body . Well , if you like it that much to hold on ... Jumping up and down for a jewelry later on . I hear you ... Stupid ... Sexist ... . Jokes . And freaking Seth duty in there ... Jane are you allright ? Yeah . I guess ... I don 't know ... I just ... I think you ... Really need to go home . Pull yourself together . Okay . I think home is a really ... Good idea for me right now . I warned you abour hiring women boss . Well , nice to see you too . We were supposed to meet for dinner tonight . Right ? I suppose I 'll have to start thinking about making that next generation a reality someday . But right now , I just want to practise . A lot . Daddy , who is she ? We need to talk . There 's an other girl in my life . My niece . 7 years old and adorable . She must have dropped that in my briefcase . You think you can handle the competition ?

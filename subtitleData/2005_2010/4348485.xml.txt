 For those of you just joining us what you 're looking at is the work of ZFT a terrorist organization responsible for at least half a dozen biological attacks . Everything we know , in your packets including a copy of their manifesto , their ideology and their methods . Destruction by technology , which boils down to the following : Attempting to provoke or prepare for war . - War ? With whom ? - That 's the question , isn 't it ? What we do know is these acts seem to be increasing in frequency . And that their targets are unpredictable and therefore unprotectable . Taxi ! Taxi ! Evidence suggests ZFT is funded by an unlikely source and a name I 'm sure you 've all heard of . William Bell , founder of Massive Dynamic . Wait , wait ! Hold the bus ! You go up Park ? Past Lenox Hill Hospital ? Yes , six stops away . Are you feeling okay ? Fine . Just go , please . Those of you assembled in this room now have a single clear-cut goal : To provide actionable evidence establishing a link between Bell and ZFT . Agents Olivia Dunham and Charlie Francis will be coordinating the investigation . All efforts and information go through them . Now let 's go to work . Stop the bus . Stop , please , I have to get off . Ma 'am , please sit . I 'm not allowed to ... - Stop the bus . I have to get off now . - Okay , okay . Open the door . Oh , my God , please . Please help , somebody . Oh , my God . Oh , I can 't breathe . Oh , my God . - Miss , you need some help ? - Lady , you okay ? Yeah , 911 ? I 'm standing on the ... Find anything new in there , Walter ? You 've read the manifesto about a dozen times cover to cover , so just wondering . I need to show you something , Peter . - Hey . - Hey . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . Show and tell , apparently . What is this ? I don 't know what I 'm looking at . This typewriter is Belly 's . I remember the day he purchased it . It was raining . Do you understand what you 're saying ? That William Bell doesn 't just fund ZFT he wrote their manifesto and is responsible for everything ? Absolutely not . William Bell was many things . He was ambitious , he was egotistical , he was temperamental . But he wasn 't a madman . Although the ideas in this manifesto are radical he wouldn 't do this . These horrendous things . He would never do it . There are references all throughout to the chapter of ethics but there is no such chapter . It is missing . And I believe that someone has removed it to suit their own evil purposes . - And I can prove it . - How ? Get another copy of the book . With all the pages ... There is no other copy . This is the only one . - I 'll get it . - He wrote it here . In this lab . It could still be here somewhere , the original . - And what if you 're wrong ? - I 'm not wrong . And when I find it , you will see . It will absolve him , Peter . Peter , it 's Olivia . So this is what I got so far . Bus driver called 911 . Reported an agitated woman got off his bus . Moments later she caught fire and exploded . Police combed the area they couldn 't find any evidence of an accelerant or an incendiary device . There 's something strange in your neighborhood . Who you gonna call ? So , what do you make of this , Walter ? Well , from what Agent Francis described it 's possible we 're dealing with a case of spontaneous human combustion . I thought that was just a myth . A myth is just an unverified fact . - Maybe she was hit by a tiny meteor . - That 's also possible . Until I get this body to the lab I won 't be able to say anything with certainty . I 'll get the coroner to prep the bodies . Bodies ? Is there another somewhere ? You okay ? Yeah , I just ... Broyles . Send her in . - Philip . - Nina . I won 't play coy , Philip . I understand the FBI has opened an investigation into Massive Dynamic . As you can imagine , we spend a lot of money on counterintelligence . And any probe into our finances raises red flags . So , what are you fishing for ? Industrial espionage ? Treaty violations ? We have evidence that William Bell may be involved with several biological attacks perpetrated this past year . - But that 's ridiculous . - Perhaps . But as long as you 're here if you have something to offer , now would be the time . I 'm not one of your street thugs that you can bully , Philip . - And William Bell is not a terrorist . - I 'd like to hear him tell me that himself . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . He 's traveling . You 're wasting your time . William Bell is not the enemy . Is there something else ? Matter is just energy waiting to happen . The average adult at rest contains enough potential energy to explode with the force of five very large hydrogen bombs . You know , theoretically , you 're actually right . Ha-ha-ha . My son finally agrees with me . - Agent Farnsworth , take a note of that . - We 're not good at releasing it . Well , it needs a spark , of course , a trigger . What do you think released it in her ? Some say a particle is to blame . The appropriately named pyroton . Maybe we could finally prove that it exists . Peter , fire up the electron microscope . - I might have taken that apart . - What on earth for ? I needed the parts for a project I 'm working on . As I said , the potential for destruction in each of us is infinite . Yes , Jim , I understand . Right away . I had you pegged as a creature of habit . Heh . You changed your office . - Come again ? - Your desk . You 've moved it . Uh , ahem . We know from the driver what stop she got on . He 's worked up an artist 's sketch rendering so we 'll canvass the area , see if we can ID her . What about the other victim ? Did the bus driver see her get on too ? Were they not together ? I 'm sorry , you mean one . - There was only one victim . - I 'm confused . Agent Dunham ? Where are we on this ? The bus driver remembered what stop she , uh ... What stop she got on . He gave us an artist 's sketch rendering . We 're gonna show it around and see if we can ID her . - What the hell is going on here ? - Sanford . Why is the entire 13th floor trying to link William Bell to biological terror attacks ? - We have evidence Bell ... - I know what you have . Testimony from a dead man who was an admitted terrorist . Well , his testimony confirms what we 've long suspected . Massive Dynamic may be involved or behind events we 've been witnessing . William Bell and Massive Dynamic are the Defense Department 's largest contractors . These waters are much too deep for a fishing expedition . Are you seriously suggesting we ignore ... ? I am telling you to drop this , considering you have nothing more than an unsubstantiated report from a hostile source . Clear ? - Are we really going to ... ? - No . Get more evidence . Just a few more centimeters . You know , Walter , working with you it 's amazing the sort of things you get used to . - You 're not the first person to tell me that . - Wow . Looks like somebody could have flossed more . Okay . Let 's just hope that she has her dental records on file . File ? Of course . My filing system . Perhaps that 's where I hid the manifesto . Like how you seal things in the walls of your house ? Or how you squirrel things in deposit boxes around the country ? I would hardly call that filing . I was trying to hide things because I was afraid someone would unlock all my secrets . I didn 't realize that the someone would be me . Where 's my Geiger counter ? I left it here . A radiation detector is gonna help find the manifesto ? No , but I find that the rhythmic ticking it emits helps me think . Oh , Walter , Peter actually cannibalized that for his project too . Oh , no . Look , this has got to stop . Lab rule number one : Do not borrow Walter 's equipment without asking . - Walter . We found a match on the victim . - Oh ? Her name is Susan Pratt . Thank you . We 'll take it from here . Susan Pratt . She 's 29 years old . Single , worked for New York Highway Department . Toll-booth operator . That 's a lonely line of work . Doesn 't look like she had much of a social life either . She 's definitely a table for one . Hey , Liv . Do you think there was something wrong with her ? - What do you mean ? - You know . Good-looking woman in the prime of her life no evidence of a boyfriend , or any friends , for that matter . Just doesn 't exactly strike me as being normal . Well , I guess that depends on what your definition of normal is . Liv . Charlie , I think I found something . She has a $ 30,000 check from an Isaac Winters . I found something too . I think you should take a look at this . What the hell happened to her ? Walter , I 'm back . - Did you get it ? - No , I told you , they don 't have it . It has to be Frankenberry , that 's what I ate back then . If I 'm to remember where I hid the manuscript it 's simple sense memory , Peter . They don 't have it . For all we know , they don 't make it . I did , however , get you this . All the artificial sugary sweetness a growing scientist needs . Hello , Agent Dunham . Let me guess . You 're a cornflakes gal . Am I correct ? Yeah , why not ? We went to the victim 's apartment and there appears to be evidence of other fires . So the bus stop wasn 't her first incident ? No . Walter , does that mean something to you ? Well , it changes everything . We can rule out spontaneous human combustion , for one . I mean , that 's strictly a one-off event , as you can imagine . So what does it rule in ? Pyrokinesis . - Stop . This is no time for jokes , Walter . - Pyrokinesis ? It 's not even a real word . Made up by Stephen King . Ever see Firestarter ? Little girl who can start fires with her mind ? Mr. King coined the term , but the phenomenon existed long before that . It 's not that complicated . It 's merely a form of telekinesis , the ability to move objects with the mind . - " Merely . " - However , with pyrokinetics they can excite objects at a molecular level . Well ... Well , look . Think of each of these grains of cereal as molecules . As the molecules start to vibrate more quickly they generate heat energy until that energy must be released . Fascinating , Walter but it still doesn 't explain why Susan Pratt blew up . I suspect this was a newfound ability . It takes training to generate a heat source outside of the body . Without proper control , the energy is turned inward . You see ? She had no other options . So you think that she had a choice to either blow somebody else up or blow herself up ? Yes . But this poor woman had yet to master her ability . Which made her a powder keg . Emotional stress , agitation , any high anxiety , would set her off . So where does this ability come from ? Is it that she was just born different ? Or is it something that someone did to her ? That is the real question now , isn 't it ? - I 'm not cleaning that up , by the way . - Dunham . We got a hit from that check you found in Susan Pratt 's apartment . It was cut from a law firm , signed by Isaac Winters . He has an office in Charlestown . No movement . Why am I not surprised you brought one of those ? Because you know me too well . If we get caught , I don 't know you at all . Looks like somebody left in a hurry . You have four new messages . Mr. Winters , this is Susan . Susan Pratt . You told me to call you if anything odd started happening . Well , it did , after I took the tests . Please call me back . I 'm gonna call ERT , have them dust for prints . Mr. Winters , it 's Susan again . You told me not to talk to anybody , but I 'm scared . What 's happening to me ? Attention , all citizens . Evacuate the area now . This is not a test . Hey . Liv . You okay ? You sure you haven 't had any LSD ? Mescaline ? Magic mushrooms ? It wasn 't a drug trip , Walter . Well , hallucinations can be caused by a number of things . Could you look straight ahead , please ? Sleep deprivation , concussion , brain tumor . I feel like I 'm losing my mind . Oh , I don 't think so . If you were actually going insane , you 'd likely have no idea it was happening . Take it from me . When did these episodes start ? How did they feel ? First was Susan Pratt 's body . Then it was in Broyles ' office , the other , on the street . The same people , the same places , but bleak . I mean , the city was on fire . Fascinating . There 's another possibility , but it 's a bit complicated . Deja vu . It wasn 't deja vu , Walter . Not even close . Not typical . Protracted deja vu , prolonged . You 're familiar with the pliability of space-time , yes ? Of course . Who isn 't ? Wait , let me explain . Most of us experience life as a linear progression , yes ? Like this . This is an illusion , because every day , life presents us with an array of choices . As a result , life should look more like this : And each choice leads to a new path . To go to work , to stay home . And each choice we take creates a new reality . Do you understand ? Yes , but what does it have to do with deja vu ? Deja vu is simply a momentary glimpse to the other side . Almost everyone experiences it . We feel that we 've been somewhere before because , actually , we have in another reality . It 's another path . The road not taken . Walter , why me ? Why am I seeing these visions ? I don 't know . Walter , what about William Bell 's drug trials ? Cortexiphan ? - You said that it worked on perception . - Yes . If it 's true , and I was part of the trials when I was a kid is it possible that it 's causing these visions ? I don 't know . But what I do know is that you are a committed investigator . You 're a perceptive agent . If you are having these visions , whatever they are , there must be a reason . - Trust me . - Really , Walter ? From a man who routinely sees little green men prancing through the lab ? Hey , I think I found something . It 's another victim who died the same way Susan Pratt did . I checked it out and the guy who runs the website lives in Malden . - Yes ? - My name is Olivia Dunham . I 'm a special agent with the FBI . We need to speak to Emmanuel Grayson . May I see your credentials , please ? Mr. Grayson , you operate a website called Galaxy Truths . Where you claim to uncover conspiracies perpetrated by foreign governments . I don 't claim . I accomplish . Unlike you two . You 're just pawns being used by the government to spread their propaganda . Look , I can appreciate your opinion , Mr. Grayson ... No , look , look , you 're right . Okay ? She 's a fed , but I 'm not . I 'm just like you . I am a citizen in search of the truth . Give me the photo . We downloaded this off of your website . It claims this person was a victim of spontaneous human combustion . Now , you gotta tell us , where did this one happen ? Budapest . Three weeks ago . Victim was an American graduate student on holiday . The Hungarian police say he was attacked and set on fire . - That 's not the truth . - Why do you say that ? Are you familiar with William Bell ? Of course . William Bell killed these people . What do you mean ? William Bell 's company , Massive Dynamic , is a cover . For all manner of unethical behavior . Multinational , outside the purview of government control . He founded it to continue his experiments with impunity . Among them , secret drug trials . This was one of his test subjects . Then why would William Bell have him killed ? Well , he didn 't . At least not intentionally . You see , Bell is trying to activate his subjects . To see which ones were successful . Some can handle the process , others can 't . What process ? - To create super-soldiers . - Super-soldiers ? Yes . Like Khan Noonien Singh . To defend us in the coming war . - What war ? - I 'm sorry . - The Khan ? - Yes . As in The Wrath of ? - Yes . - And let me guess . This war , it 's against ? The Romulans . Renegade Romulans . From the future . Here to change the timeline . The sworn enemy of the Federation . The Federation ? That would be the United Federation of Planets ? Yes . - And you all know this because ? - I am the son of Sarek . - Which makes you Spock . - Yes . Well , Mr. Spock , thank you for your time . We 'll let you get back to the bridge now . Live long and prosper . Okay , yes , you were right . But see that ? I 'm a big enough girl to admit when I 'm wrong . Oh , I think we can prepare for that possibility it shouldn 't be a problem . Mr. Prime Minister , I 'm very sorry would you mind holding for just a moment ? Thanks . Hello ? When ? Well , no . Don 't do that . Don 't do anything until I get there . Sir , I 'm sorry , something has come up , if you 'll excuse me . Yes , you too . Get me to the helicopter , fast . What if we 're overlooking something ? What if Emmanuel Grayson was right ? About which part ? Being from planet Vulcan ? No . Forget that . Some of what he said made sense . We know that William Bell conducted drug trials with experimental drugs . Cortexiphan , for one . Do you have anything stronger for my coffee ? Yeah , bottom drawer . In the cabinet behind you . And here I was , halfway kidding . - What ? - What your father said about me having these visions for a reason . Maybe there 's a clue in them I 'm meant to find . - Meaning what ? - We have one victim , Susan Pratt . But in my visions , there are always two bodies . - Who are they ? - I don 't know . Unidentified . But if I could get back to that parallel universe as Walter describes , I can ID that second charred body . What 's happening there could help us understand what 's happening here . - Happening where ? Nowhere . Here 's your new assignment . Always a pleasure seeing you , sir . Hey . Wait a sec . Harris , can you stop ? You want me to submit for a psych exam ? - That 's right . I 'm concerned for you . - Why ? I 've read your briefs . I 'd say your analysis borders on the paranoid . Besides which , your behavior 's been noted as erratic and driven by emotion , and not just by me . That 's not what this is . My colleagues need to trust me , depend on me not wonder in their minds whether I 'm losing mine . - This job is intense ... This has got nothing to do with my ability . - This is about you and me . - Right now , you are acting emotionally . Yes , you 're right , I am . I 've tried to move past our history . I 've tried to reason with you in interest of a working relationship . But you seem to get off on this . So fine , I don 't give a damn anymore . I am not gonna let you undermine my ability to do my job . You can color this anyway you like , Dunham but I am still your superior officer . That evaluation is a direct order . You put a shoot-to-kill order out on the perps . You understand me ? Don 't get close to them . - Charlie . - Yeah , what 's up ? I was wondering where we were on the Susan Pratt case . Pratt , nowhere . - Same place we were yesterday . - I 'd like to look again . You have half of Boston in quarantined lockdown and you 're worried about a pair of charred twins ? Twins ? Sorry , didn 't see you . We already ran Susan 's bio , where we didn 't find a sister . I know . - Now , what makes you think ... ? - Look . You were right . Nancy Lewis . It says here that she had a twin sister who went missing 11 years ago . Maybe Susan ran away , changed her identity . Well , she must have been running pretty hard . Where does Nancy live ? She 's local , 934 Whittier . Thanks , Charlie . Hi . Can I help you ? Nancy Lewis , my name is Isaac Winters . Nancy Lewis ? FBI . We need to ask you some questions . It 's unlocked . Nancy ? Coffee 's still hot . This is Dunham . I need immediate forensic dispatch to 934 Whittier , apartment 210 . Dunham , take a look at this . This glass has been melted . You think she 's starting fires like her sister ? What is it ? I got an idea . I 'm not sure . I got it . Don 't touch that . - We haven 't pulled prints . - You 're not gonna need to . Protocols and processing evidence are clear . Let me guess , you 're new around here . - Is everything all right ? - Yeah , everything 's fine . Just tell Mr. Protocol to let me do my job , please . It 's okay , he 's with me . Are you ever gonna tell me what it is that you are actually doing ? Help me with this first . Hold the glass up here . Gently . I sure hope this is important . I was about to take my bath . Hey . You have any problem taking it apart ? Walter tried to take back the electron microscope but I convinced him that you needed it . So , what 's going on ? Nancy Lewis was kidnapped , and we 're gonna find out who did it . I 've seen this woman before . Why does she look so familiar ? Maybe because you dissected her twin sister yesterday . Remember ? Blond girl , about 5 ' 7 " , really well done , melted fillings ? Oh , right . Astrid , can you plug that in to the DVI input ? Yes . Okay . Here 's the deal . Walter , the project that I 've been working on was for you . - For me ? It reconstructs audio . I wanted you to be able to digitize some old records you have . - I know how much they mean to you . - Thank you , son . You know , when he was 5 , he built me a popsicle napkin holder . - Dreadful design . Utterly useless . - Thank you . But this ... This is ... Ha . You 're welcome . Anyway the basic principles at work here are very simple . - You know how a record player works ? - Needle goes over the grooves . Vibrations it picks up are amplified into sound . Exactly . The principle 's the same , except instead of a needle I use the microscope to take a high-resolution digital image of the grooves on the surface . That is transferred to the computer , which translates it into audio that we can hear . - You sound just like him . I 'm guessing that with the software modifications I gave you we 're gonna do the same thing with this . You 're saying that you can play back the glass somehow . Yeah . Walter says these pyrotechnic abilities only occur during times of emotional stress . I think that when our twin was kidnapped the heat that she generated caused that window to liquefy slightly . Which means that any sound that was in this room would have left microscopic impressions in the glass . Like the grooves on a record . Exactly right . Now , if you 'll please scan the glass . - Okay , you 're ready to go . - All right . It 's transferring into the sound processor now . Let 's see what we got . That could have been one of my records . It 's okay . I already have a digital scan of the glass . Let 's try that again . Shall we ? Just slow it down . I don 't understand , this should be working . Yes . Yes . Now , attenuate for ambient noise . Get out of here . Stay away . What do you want ? Please . I have her , see you there . The poor dear . Peter , can you play it from when he starts to talk ? Yeah , one sec . Okay , just there , where 's he 's dialing . Okay , can you make that clearer ? Sure . Now , we just isolate the sound . You thinking what I 'm thinking ? My cell phone app can dial the number from the tones . This is Harris . I 'm headed out for a few hours . Anybody needs me I 'm reachable by cell phone . - You got it . I got him , Charlie . He 's headed west . I 'm right behind you . Charlie , he 's approaching a warehouse off Moore and Adams . Roger that . We 're turning on to Adams right now . Hey . - He used a remote to get in . - I guess we 'll go the old-fashioned way . - Where are we ? - No thermal activity yet . The body temperature 's normal . We 'll know more soon . Well , he 's losing patience . We need her active . Get it done . - Liv , I heard gunshots . You okay ? - Charlie , we 've got a man down . Charlie , I 've got her . Back north-west corner . - I 'm Olivia , I am with the FBI . - Help me , please . Don 't worry . You 're gonna be okay . No ! Harris , open the door ! Goddamn it , Harris , open the door . Open the door . I can 't breathe . Well , look at that . Good work , Dunham . You managed to activate her before we could . Damn it , Harris , open the door . She needs help . Not if she can control it . If not , she 'll explode and kill both of you . So one problems solves another . - I 'm burning up . - You 're gonna be okay . - Just calm down . Just calm down . - I 'm burning up . - Okay . - Yeah , it 's me . I need to speak to him . Hold on , I 'm gonna get you out of here . It worked . She 's hot . We have an active , but she 's a loss . - She 's highly unstable . - Why is this happening to me ? They did something to you , maybe to both of us , when we were just kids . Now you 're feeling the effects from that . You can control this , okay ? You can control this , I 'm gonna help you . I just need you to focus the heat away from us . - I can 't . - Yes , you can . Just focus . Focus on anything . Focus , Nancy . You can do this , Nancy . - I can 't . - You can . Yeah , I 'll take care of it . There won 't even be a trace . I ... It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . Oh , yeah , you 're gonna be okay . Oh , it 's okay . It 's okay . Okay , I think you got all of that , Walter . I 'm gonna use the bathroom . I 'll be right back . Excuse me , could you keep an eye on him make sure he doesn 't leave ? Agent Dunham . Where 's Peter ? Peter 's in the bathroom . What the hell did you people do to us ? You and William Bell , Walter . What did you do to me ? Susan Pratt and Nancy Lewis are from Jacksonville , Florida . Just like Nick Lane . A guy that you conducted drug trials on when he was a kid . The drug trials that you conducted on me . They were Belly 's . They were his trials . But you knew . Walter , you were there . And you knew . We were trying to help . - We meant no harm . - No harm ? You were drugging children . Three-year-old children , Walter . Why did you do it ? We were trying to prepare you to make you capable . Able . - Something terrible is coming . - What ? I don 't know . Walter , what did you do to us ? I don 't know . - Damn it , Walter , you do . - No . I don 't . I don 't know . I can 't remember . I 'm sorry . Hey . Hey , Walter . What just happened ? Nina . What is it ? These were all taken in the last 24 hours . You know what happened the last time he appeared with this kind of frequency . We need to talk . Astrid , I found it . The original manuscript with the extra pages . I was right . Listen to this : " Our children are our greatest resource . We must nurture them , and protect them . We must prepare them so they can one day protect us . " You see , I was ... Hello , Walter . Hello . It 's time to go . Is it time ? I 'll get my coat . Evening .

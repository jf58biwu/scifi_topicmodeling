 Though Republic victories outnumber their losses , the Jedi have been unable to stop Separatist advances in the Outer Rim . The ever-elusive General Grievous stays one step ahead of his opponents . With thousands of droid armies at his command , the Jedi can never predict where Grievous will strike next until now . Stand by . Grievous is boarding . - Status report . - There 's too many of them . Get yourselves to the escape pods . I will deal with Grievous here . But , sir , they 're commando droids . That does not matter , Captain . Now go . Jedi . Grievous . Eeth Koth , isn 't it ? I 've been looking forward to meeting you . Your reputation precedes you , General . Reputation of a coward ... and a murderer . Murederer ? Is it murder to rip the galaxy of you Jedi filth ? Greetings , Jedi , it would seem , once again , one of your order has lost his way and even better , a leading member of your Jedi Council . Listen to me , Jedi , I do not care about your politics . I do not care about your Republic . I only live to see you die . But death will not come so easily for Master Koth . I will make him suffer endlessly because I know that is more painful for you all . He 's a monster . Away with the younglings . Much there is to discuss . It 's time somebody finally put an end to that monster . On that , agreed we are . How to find him , the question remains . After engaging Grievous , we lost contact with Master Koth . He could be anywhere . Commander Wolffe has found a message in the holo transmission . Play back the message . Look . Hand signals . I admit my skills are rusty , but ... Saleucami system , sector J-19 . Zero-eight , zero-five , two-nine . Saleucami ? But intelligence reported Grievous has no ships near that sector . But so often inaccurate our intelligence is . I shall go . So will I. And I. Are you ready ? Ready and waiting . I shall engage the Separatist fleet and send you the coordinates of Grievous ' command ship . Just make sure you get it right . I always do . How do you plan on getting Grievous aboard your ship ? Not to worry . The good General and I have a history . I 'm sure he 'll want to even the score face-to-face . Meanwhile , we 'll jump in undetected and board the command ship . If Master Koth is still alive , you will find him . Hopefully , by the end of this mission , we will have saved Master Koth and captured General Grievous . Sir , we have entered the Saleucami system . Begin preparations for our landing . Yes , my lord . There are several ships coming out of hyperspace . Are they Republic or Separatist ? Republic . Three cruiser-class , four escort-class . You see ? Your compassionate friends have come to rescue you , just as I knew they would . One of the Republic ships is hailing us , my lord . Put him through . General , I knew one day I 'd catch up to you . Kenobi ! What a surprise . I assume you are here to bring me to justice . You know me too well . Indeed , I do . Prepare to fire all cannons . And be alert . Where there is Kenobi , you will always find Skywalker not far behind . The enemy ships are faster and more maneuverable . I suggest caution . Draw them in . I want to board that vessel . I shall kill Kenobi face-to-face . We certainly have his attention . Admiral Yularen , keep Grievous ' fleet occupied so Anakin 's arrival is undetected . Yes , General . Commence attack . All ships fire at will . Yes , sir . We 're moving in . Commander Cody , do you have the exact coordinates of the command ship yet ? We 're patching them through now , sir . We are receiving the coordinates from General Kenobi . How close are you going to jump in next to Grievous ' ship ? Pretty close . Buckle up , boys . Define " pretty close . " Close enough to get the job done . Get me a tractor beam lock on Kenobi 's ship and prepare a boarding party . Tractor beam has us , sir . Shall we fire on the source ? No , Cody . Let them think they have us . We need a diversion for Anakin . Coming out of hyperspace . Hang on . Primary power down . So , was that close enough for you ? Any closer , and we 'd be flying down hallways . Next time . Coast is clear , Rex . Copy that , sir . Stay here and guard the entrance . This may be our only way out . Skywalker , Master Koth is located on the bridge . This way . Remember , we need to keep Grievous on this ship until General Skywalker is clear . Kenobi . How we doing ? We are close . So , Kenobi , is everything going as planned ? That depends on your point of view , General . You wouldn 't come here without a plan , and you wouldn 't come alone . Tell me , do you think Skywalker has rescued Master Koth yet ? Surprise . Not exactly . At least , they 're not destroyer droids . The General 's description of your tactics have been 100 % accurate today . Very impressive , even by my standards . Your plans have come to ruination , Jedi . I hear a lot of talking , General , but in the final accounting , what does all the talk get you ? A futile quest for power , a mutilated body , and your place as Dooku 's errand boy . I 'm no errand boy . I am not in this war for Dooku 's politics . I am the leader of the most powerful droid army the galaxy has ever seen . An army with no loyalty , no spirit , just programming . Why do you need to show all your power ? What have you to gain ? The future , a future where there are no Jedi . The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi ends here . One more step , and your friend will die . Your friends shall die , Kenobi , and you shall soon follow . Got to get it ... Behind you . I see you got my message . Where 's Grievous ? If everything 's gone according to plan , he 's on board Obi-Wan 's ship . He 's been captured ? If we can cut off his escape , there 's a good chance of that . Surrender , General . Never ! I hope you 've rescued Master Koth , because Grievous is headed back to his ship . You both go . I 'll make it back . I 'll be fine . I 'll have to disagree with you on that one . Master Gallia , you go ahead . I 'll get Eeth back to the shuttle . May the Force by with you . Get back to the bridge . We need to detach before Grievous jumps ship . Cody , come in . - Yes , sir . - Grievous is heading your way . Open fire on the Republic ship . Target their engines . But , sir , the ships are still attached . It doesn 't matter . Prepare all troops for our landing on Saleucami . The circuits are fried . We have no controls . I can 't even get the engines online . We 've lost our stabilizers . I can 't hold her steady . Until we meet again , Kenobi . Hurry . We can still catch him . Obi-Wan , Anakin 's leaving . We 'll be trapped on the ship . Anakin , come in . We 're in a bit of a spot , and we need a way off of Grievous ' ship . There 's a large hangar near your position . Make your way there , and I 'll pick you up . All droids to the landing craft . Get to your stations . We 're going to detach . Prepare to launch . The reactor 's been breached . I can 't lock it down ! Here we go . Anakin , get me Admiral Yularen . Several craft detached from Grievous ' ship and attempted to land on Saleucami . Then we 'll have to land and follow them . Prepare the tanks . Yes , sir . There must be several landing sites . It may be hard to locate the good General . You 'll have to command the space battle while Rex , Cody , and I head to the surface . You sure you can handle this on your own ? I think I can manage . I 'll get Master Koth to a medical frigate . You all took a great risk rescuing me . You 're welcome , Master Koth . Since you divided your forces , Grievous is still at large . I would have gladly given my life if it meant bringing that monster to justice ! At least we all live to fight another day . Fugitive ! Though the Republic has won many decisive battles against the Separatist army in the Outer Rim , the Jedi have failed to capture the elusive General Grievous . After specifically targeting members of the Jedi Council , a trap was set , but following a fierce confrontation , the droid General managed to escape to the surface of the planet Saleucami . Now the chase is on as General Kenobi leads a squadron of clone troopers and closes in on his target . We must find a way off this planet before they find us . We need to hurry and find an escape pod . Instead of scattering our troops looking for all the escape pods , we shall head towards the wreckage of the landing transport first . Contact the fleet . Our transmitter is destroyed . There is only one escape pod that survived . We must get there as quickly as possible . Let 's hope the transmitter is still intact . Now , find me some transportation . Sir , the cruiser 's returned to orbit . Any sign of Grievous ? I believe we 've found Grievous ' ship . Power low . Shutting down . I can 't go on . Sir , we need to get our power recharged . Not this again ! How could your power cells be so depleted ? You would not let us ride on one of those creatures with you , sir . If you would allow us to close down for a few ... Any more complaints ? I don 't think so . That 's what I thought . Now let 's find that pod . Yikes . Normalizing intakes are still warm . This couldn 't have happened too long ago . The crew compartment 's almost entirely destroyed . We 'll split into teams . Rex , take Jesse , Hardcase , and Kix - and search those wetlands . - Yes , sir . Cody , you , Crys , and I will pick it up from here . And Rex , if you get a visual on Grievous , contact us before you engage . - Rex is a smart man . - Indeed . Always thinking on his feet . These droids are too gone to give us any good intel . Here 's one ! Let 's load the droid in the tank . We 'll inspect it on the go . In range . Take the shot . Protect the Captain . Commando droids . Jesse , you better get back here . What do you have ? We 've broken the access codes and powered up the droid 's guidance system . According to his memory logs , he fired the emergency thrusters on the escape pod to avoid a mid-air collision . - Collision with what ? - Another escape pod . There was no time to correct for the steeper glide path , which is why this droid 's pod crashed . Can you pinpoint the landing zone for the other pod ? I can put us within two to three klicks of it , sir . Alert the men . We 've picked up the scent . How bad ? Pretty bad . I need to remove his armor to see the full extent of the damage . Those snipers might have called for backup . Unless we want to start getting picked off one by one , we should find a better cover first . Wait a minute . Those critters are domesticated . I think we 're on farmland , and where there 's a farm , there 's a usually a farmer . Let 's find his homestead . We want no trouble here . Easy with that weapon , ma 'am . We 're here as friends . - State your business . - Our Captain 's been hurt . We need ... - I 'm no doctor , so just ... - We have a medic , ma 'am . We just need a place to tend him overnight . - Who 's ... - Get back inside , both you . Mom . There are some benches out back in the barn . - It 's the best I can do . - That 'll be fine , ma 'am . What ? What happened ? Commando droids took a potshot . That would 've gone through your heart had it been two inches to the left . I can 't move my arm . - You have some nerve damage . - Understood . Now patch me up and let 's get on with it . Sir , you 're in no condition . It will heal , but it 'll take time . We 're getting under way , Kix . That 's an order . Sir , as the team medic , when it comes to the health of the men , including you , I outrank everyone . So , I respectfully order you , sir , to get some ... Excuse me . - If there 's not enough ... - That 's plenty . - Thank you ... - Suu . I told you to stay in the house . I couldn 't help it , mom . It got away . You look like my daddy . Don 't bother the soldier . - Now get inside with your brother . - Yes , mom . My husband is away delivering our first harvest . Do you require anything else ? Resume the search without me . You 're in command . I 'll be fine . There 's our escape pod . Any sign of Grievous ? It looks deserted . He must be heading to a second escape pod . - Captain Rex , come in , please . - It 's Jesse , sir . - Rex was injured . - What 's his condition ? He 'll be fine , but we had to find him shelter tonight . Grievous is on the move . We 're headed to the west . Swing around and we can meet up at the final escape pod . We 're going to need all the firepower we can muster . Roger that , sir . We 're speeding towards you . We should be there by now ! We are , sir , there . Almost . You had better be interpreting the coordinates correctly . We 're almost there , sir . One klick out . Straight ahead . I 'm losing power . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? You 're a clone . So ... I see the war has finally made its way out here , and I guess I can expect a visit from some droids soon . What 's your number and rank ? My name is Lawquane . Cut Lawquane . And I 'm just a simple farmer . You 're a deserter . I like to think I 'm merely exercising my freedom to choose : to choose not to kill for a living . That is not your choice to make . You swore an oath to the Republic . You have a duty . I have a duty , you 're right . But it 's to my family . Does that count , or do you still plan to turn me in ? - Do I have a choice ? - Daddy ! You 're home ! Look what I drew you , dad ! That 's great , Jek . I see you two have met . He looks just like you , daddy . I told him . You did . I was just making our guest , Captain ... What 's your number ? I also have a name , believe it or not . He was injured . His men brought him here . I told him he could stay just for the night . Of course he can . We never turn away those in need , do we ? No , we always help anyone we can . Right . You look hungry , Rex . No , I 'm fine . I 'll stay here . - You have to eat with us . Please . - Please ? They 're never going to stop till you say yes . All right . I 'll join you . You and I may be clones , but we 're still individuals . You have a name rather than a number , Captain . Why is that ? Perhaps our leaders feel it 's a more efficient way of distinguishing us . More efficient than a number ? I doubt the Kaminoans think that way . Still , a name has to make you feel unique , especially in an army where everyone looks like you and talks ... Actually , I never really thought about it . Yes , you have . How would you know ? Because I 'm as close to you as any life-form can be . I 've seen how you look at my family , our home . Come on , Rex , admit it . You 've thought about what your life could look like if you were to also leave the army , choose the life you want . What if I am choosing the life I want ? What if I 'm staying in the army because it 's meaningful to me ? And how is it meaningful ? Because I 'm part of the most pivotal moment in the history of the Republic . If we fail , then our children and their children could be forced to live under an evil I can 't well imagine . If you were to have children , of course , but ... that would be against the rules , wouldn 't it ? Isn 't that what somebody programmed you to believe , Captain ? No , Cut . It 's simply what I believe . It doesn 't matter if it 's my children or other people 's children . Does that meet with your approval ? Perfectly . To each his own . That 's what I always say . What does that mean , daddy ? It means you can do anything with your life that you want to . - How are you doing , Jesse ? - Closing in , sir . We have a visual . Very well . We 'll meet you in the middle . Is your transmitter working ? I don 't know . I haven 't used it yet . All right . I 'll check on it . Stupid battle droids . Sir , you made it . Get back in the pod and send out a distress signal towards the rest of our fleet . We need to get a shuttle down here immediately . Roger , roger . But I must inform you , sir , there are multiple life-forms approaching from the east and west . Battle positions ! Good move . Very good move . So what was it ? What made me decide to leave the corps ? Shortly after the battle of Geonosis , our troop transport got caught between two Separatist gunships . They fired at us with everything they had . We crashed . Most of us were either dead or severely injured . So when they started working their way through the wounded , killing us off , I knew there was no hope . I ran . It still haunts me . I 'm sorry . It 's the day I felt my life didn 't have any meaning . Everyone I cared about , my team , was gone . I was just another expendable clone waiting for my turn to be slaughtered in a war that made no sense to me . Can you understand that , Rex ? I 've been in countless battles and lost many brothers . They were my family . My home . Daddy , we finished our chores . - Can we go outside and play ? - Please ? Okay , only for a few minutes . Thank you , daddy . Come on , Jek . And keep the house in view . We will . You have wonderful children . I know you think I 'm a coward , Rex , but believe me , I 'll fight to my last breath to keep them safe . Fire ! Tank two ! Port side ! Great shot ! Where is that ship ? Shaeeah ? Where are you ? Where are you ? Stop fooling around . You are not funny . Am too . Look . In the field . What is it ? It wasn 't there before . It 's some kind of spaceship , I think . Hello ? Do you think somebody 's in there ? I didn 't do it . You did . Monsters ! - What 's wrong ? - Monsters . They 're chasing us . What monsters ? Honey , where ? They hatched from the big egg in the field . This is not good . I count 20 . Cut , what 's out there ? Commando droids . What are they doing ? - Suu , get the kids upstairs . - Come . Come now . What weapons do you have ? We can catch them in a cross fire . You take that corner . No , Captain . With respect , you 're not in charge here . I can be useful . You 're injured . You have only one good arm . But I can fight . So can I. Rex , I need you to be the last line of defense for my family . I 'll take care of them . Thank you . Finally ! General Grievous , sir . We see you below us . Are you ready to depart ? Concentrate your fire on that ship . They 're shooting at us . Coming back around . Sir , that ship 's coming around for another landing attempt . Keep firing . Don 't let that ship land . The guns are overheated ! Always something . Cody , Jesse , cover me . General , behind you ! They 're coming for you ! Daddy ? I 'm okay . It 's over . Forget trying to land ! Fire the engines . Jedi scum . Are you all right , sir ? We 're right back where we started . Call the cruisers . - See if they can stop that ship . - Right away , sir . And tell them to send someone to pick us up . All right , - that should do it . - Captain Rex . Are you going to turn in my husband ? I 'm sorry , Suu . It 's my duty , but in my condition , I probably won 't remember any of this . Thank you . You 're still a deserter , Cut , but you 're certainly not a coward . Captain Rex , are you still with us ? Yes , General Kenobi . I 'm still with you and thankfully on the mend , sir . That 's great news . We certainly missed you at the party . Sorry , sir . I had to attend one of my own . Can 't wait to hear about it . We 're standing by . You 're welcome to stay , Rex . This is your home , Cut . My family is elsewhere .

Is this some sort of secret base ? You must show me around one day , Captain . - Everything all right ? - How long before we head off again ? - My uncle 's expecting me . - When did you leave ? - About half an hour ago . - Which date ? - Today , December the 18th . - Which year ? Which year ? Which year , I need to know . 195 3 . - There 's no need to be frightened . - Who are you exactly ? The least you know about us , the better . Meet the team . - Toshiko . - Gwen . Doctor Owen Harper . - John Ellis . - Emma Louise Cowell . - Diane Holmes . - Please , follow me . - At least it wasn 't a spaceship full of aliens . - That might have been easier .

But if all this is true , then how do we get back ? You don 't . According to history , your plane never returned . I 'm sorry . What 's gonna happen to us ? Never mind about us . What happened to everyone else ? Our families . Your father died in 1959 . He was 48 . Dad said he 'd die young . All the men in the munitions factory did . Your mother lived till she was 81 , though . I know this is hard to take in , but is there anyone else ? My son , Alan Ellis . He was born on the 6th of April , 1937 . 14 Park Place , Grangetown . He might still be alive . The archives in the ' 50s weren 't that well-documented . We 'll try again tomorrow . Right now , you need to get some sleep . Friends ? Uh , boyfriend ? Not really . Never stayed in one place long enough . It 's a bit basic . Not when you 've slept in barracks . I was going to close a deal on a shop in Dublin tomorrow . - What do you trade in ? - Uh , food , knick-knacks , essentials . - What are you after ? - A bit of music . There 's , uh , photographs of my family in here . I 'll see what I can do . Don 't worry , Captain Harkness , I 'll look after the ladies . Call me Jack . - Who else is here ? - Couple of young girls . Pretty dress . Thank you . I made it myself . - Where are you from ? - Bristol . What were you going to Dublin for ? Auntie Nora 's ill and Uncle Finn can 't manage the children . It 'll be good practice for when I have children of my own mum says . She 's gone next door so Uncle Finn can telephone . She 'll know I 'm missing by now . Emma , she found out in 195 3 . Over 50 years have passed , remember ? What will she think happened ? It must have been like one of those murders where they never find the body . They seemed to think the plane went down in the sea . These will be your means of identification for the authorities .

No . - We can fake references . - You can 't take away our names . For God 's sake , man , it 's all we 've got left . It 's my son 's name , it 's the name above my shop . You 're right , I didn 't think . You should keep your name . I 'd suggest you use £ 2 5 for your food , and £ 20 for luxuries like cigarette , magazines ... My dad only made £ 10 a week . Things are a lot more expensive now . - How did it do that ? - It 's automatic . - It knows you 're there . - But how ? There are wave bouncing detectors which emit high frequency radio waves , - and then look for reflections ... - Bananas ! Of course , bananas are far more interesting . Look at all this . We 'd just come off rationing in ' 5 3 . - Yeah , sorry , we are a consumer society . - It 's bloody fantastic . - How much food money have I got left ? - £ 15.40 . - £ 12 . 10 , you 'll ruin your teeth . - You sound like my mum .

I 've , uh , I 've been reading up on you . England to Australia in four days , 1952 , that is impressive . - Yeah , terrible wind across the Bengal Bay . - Something you ate ? Uh ... So , how did you get into this ? Ferried planes during the war . Of course , when it was over , we were supposed to revert to being dutiful wives and daughters . But I 'd got a taste for it . No pig-headed man was going to tell me what to do . Ah . Sky Gipsy ? After the engine . The De Havilland Gipsy Six , a work of genius . Tuned with a higher compression ratio so it can squeeze far more energy from its air-fuel mixture . - Can I take her up ? - No . - You could get arrested . You haven 't got a licence . - But I ... Bugger . It 's no longer valid . I guess I 'm just another pig-headed man telling you what to do . Well , you 'd better make it up to me . I want to learn all about this new world . Blackpool were 3-1 down , then Stanley Matthews worked his magic . He scored two goals in the last 20 minutes . Bolton lost 4-3 . My boy was on his knees , punching the air .

So how did you end up here , doing whatever it is that you do ? It 's a long story . I 'm a slow drinker . You know everything about me . What 's the problem ? It gets kinda complicated . What , did you fall through time , too ? Yeah , you could say that . Sorry , mate , you can 't smoke in here . What are you doing Christmas Eve ? We could go carol singing . I 'm sorry , love , but I 'll be getting hammered . - Where are your families ? - No idea . We grew up in care . Like a children 's home ? - I haven 't got anyone else , either . - What happened to you ? My parents are dead , so I came down here to start afresh . So they didn 't leave you a house or anything ? No . I 've got nothing . Were you close to them ? Yes . I loved them very much . Must have been an awful Christmas for them , thinking I 'd drowned . I just want to know what kind of life he had , my son . He might have kids . I could be passing my own flesh and blood in the street . Find him , Jack . He 's all I 've got left . Cheers . - What ? - I 'm waiting for you to pull out my chair . Let me get this straight . You expect equality and chivalry ? I don 't see why they should be mutually exclusive . Well , if it makes you happy . Your chair , ma 'am . Thank you . So , what other strides have women made ? Well , on the strange but true , how about this ? You don 't have to have sex to have kids any more . What ? How come ? Get yourself inseminated with a sort of syringe , cheery little process . Seriously , men donate sperm anonymously . A little shuffle into a pot at a sperm bank . And they say romance is dead . Oh , come on , I wasn 't born yesterday . No , but for a bird who 's going on 90 , you look pretty hot . - What was your favourite song ? - Well , it 's hard to say . I know what mine was . # I just blew in from the windy city # The windy city is mighty pretty # But they ain 't got what we got # I 'm tellin ' ya , boys # What do you think you 're playing at ? I thought I could trust you to behave . - Where do you want to go now ? - Well , I 'm in your hands . Well , we could go back to mine . You could read up about yourself on the net . That sounds like a line . Um , it 's not a line . I 'm not chatting you up , not because I don 't think you 're attractive , because you are , but because I wouldn 't want you to think I was taking advantage of you . Got any Scotch ? - I don 't see why she had to get you involved . - She called me . She was upset . - She was drinking . - I only had half a glass . Enough to make a show of yourself . We 're not meant to draw attention to ourselves . We 're not the same as them . We can 't trust anyone . - Will you be okay now , Emma ? - Don 't worry , I won 't let her out of my sight again . I don 't like liver . Sit down , young lady , and be grateful for what you 're given . - And why should I listen to you ? - Emma . Only my dad gets to talk to me like that . I 'm never going to see him again , am I ? Or my mum , or my best friend , or my dog , and I miss them ! And I hate this filthy stinking place . I never had this sort of trouble with my son . Women have been to space , too , you know . You got a lot of catching up to do . - Do you have a girlfriend ? - No . So who do all those beauty products belong to ? - Uh , me , actually . - No ? Oi , real men can moisturise , too , you know . It 's not very homely here . No , I 'm not here that much . It doesn 't seem worth the effort . - You smoke too much . - So I gather . Amelia Earhart . She disappeared in 1932 . - Do you think she 's still out there somewhere ? - No , I doubt it . One in a zillion chance you ending up here . A whole new world . Oh , it 's not so bad once you get used to it . I reckon you 'll fit in just fine . I 'm glad you haven 't got a girlfriend . Me , too . I take it that wasn 't your first time . I had a lover . He was married . And you didn 't care ? Well , I was free to do what I liked and I didn 't have to cook and clean for him . - It suited me . I 'm not exactly marriage material . - No . I always thought the ' 50s were uptight , sexually repressed , you know . - You didn 't invent it , you know . - Mmm . Can we do it again ? Don 't see why not . We could have an affair . We could be fuck buddies . - What 's a fuck buddy ? - It 's , um ... It 's a friend that you have casual sex with . - There 's nothing casual about what we just did . - Oh , no . No , I didn 't mean that . Sex shouldn 't be devalued . Both parties should give it 100 % concentration . Because when you take off together , it 's the next best thing to flying . Emma is my auntie 's step-daughter . She was meant to spend Christmas in Cardiff with a friend , but they had this awful argument last night and , uh , she rang me . Got my number from mam . The thing is , she doesn 't really want to go back home so I thought , I thought maybe she could stay with us . We 've got a lot to catch up on . For Christmas ? - I 'd better get a bigger turkey . - Oh ! - Thanks . - Aw , this is Rhys , my long-suffering boyfriend . And he lives here . - Don 't your parents mind ? - Emma 's parents are a bit religious . Oh , uh , better not tell them you saw my morning glory then , eh ? The thing is , I couldn 't tell him your parents were dead . He 'd ask too many questions . The thing is , he doesn 't know exactly what I do . Just ... We can 't expect John and Diane to look after her . I mean , they 're complete strangers . I had to take her in . Diane didn 't even come home last night . Uh , I think she was in a BB . I 'm gonna take her job-hunting later if that 's all right . Jack , John 's son , I think I 've found him . Come and meet Alan , though I 'm not sure how much help he 'll be to you . Alan , there 's someone here to see you . He 's a nephew on your father 's side . - He 's been tracking down the family history . - Is Sally coming ? Sally is his wife . She passed away a while back . Sorry , this isn 't one of his better days . - What 's wrong with him ? - Alzheimer 's . - What 's that ? - He 's senile . He doesn 't remember who he is most of the time . Couldn 't live at home any more . He 'd leave hobs on , forget to dress , you know . He never had any children so there was no one there to look after him . That 's you and your dad , playing footy out the back . That 's your dad and your mum and your new television set . - When can I go home ? - N U RSE : You 're not well enough , love . I don 't like it here . They took my clothes . I 'll have a word , they 're probably in the wash . Keeps me going , this one . What did he do for a living ? Was he in retail ? Oh , I think he was a fireman . That 's what I did . In the war . - £ 60 for half an hour ! - Ah , no worries . I 'll pay . Cessna ! Oh , it 's my first plane . I bought one after the war . They 've hardly changed . Dream to fly . We 'll soon get you back behind the ... throttle . Thanks , Owen . Matthews did three set-ups in 20 minutes then Bill Perry cracked home the winner . You said he had wings on his feet , that 's why he was called a winger . - You used to say clever things like that . - Blackpool won ! - Yes . - Oh ! Alan , it 's me , your dad . I bought you that Football Annual you wanted for Christmas , Alan . It was in my desk drawer . Alan , please ? N U RSE : Everything all right ? He remembered who won the FA Cup Final when he was a boy . He sometimes remembers snippets from his childhood . It 's quite common with dementia . When 's Dad coming , Mum ? N U RSE : I 'm not your mum , love . JOH N : Alan ? Who are you ? John 's witnessing the end of his world , the end of his line . And we can 't help . There 's no puzzle to solve , no enemy to fight , just three lost people who 've somehow become our responsibility . Best I can do is Friday 29th , 3 : 00 . - Can 't you take her up today ? - Fully booked . Oh , it 's all right . I 've flown for years . I can go up on my own . Not without a licence , sorry . Erm , maybe you could cancel someone ? We 'll pay extra . I couldn 't do that to my regulars now , could I ? Look , it 's fine . Book me in for the 29th . It 's Diane Holmes . Diane , I 'm really sorry . I should have called ahead . For goodness sake . This is so silly . It 's just I was just really looking forward to ... Ignore me . Let 's get out of here . Do you think she 'll be all right , though ? I don 't think she 's even had a proper boyfriend before . Gwen , stop fussing . She 'll be fine , man . - What was that for ? - For putting up with me . I deserve a lot more for doing that . Cheers . Oi ! Hands off . Go back to your friends , there 's a good boy . - What are you playing at ? - Uh , I wasn 't going to let him do anything . You might not have had much choice . Come on , Gwen , don 't you think you 're overreacting ? I was just having a kiss and a cuddle . He was after a lot more than that . This is disgusting . I just want you to know that people are more sexually aware these days . Then maybe you 'll be more careful . Mum said that no man wants to marry soiled goods . Attitudes have changed . As long as it 's safe , and between two consenting adults , no one cares . So , how many men have you done it with ? A few . - And were you in love with all of them ? - No . Sex can just be about having a good time together . If you 're in the right mood , with the right guy , it 's the best , no big deal . - So , if I meet a boy ... - Mmm-hmm . - ... and we get on ... - Mmm . - ... and he wants sex ... - Mmm-hmm . - ... then , you think I should let him ? - No , no , that 's not what I said . - So , what are you saying ? - Sex is nothing to be ashamed of . And as for you , well , your first time should be with someone special . Do you wish you 'd waited for Rhys ? - He 's your special someone , isn 't he ? - Yes . Yes , I suppose . And I bet sex with him is better than with the others . Well ... - Well , I will wait for Mr Right , I think . - Mmm-hmm . - I 'm really not the kind of girl who sleeps around . - H mm . I 'm going to brush my teeth . Thanks for the chat . Not a problem . Leave it . I can 't if I want to fly a jet plane , 'cause that 's all flying is now , sitting on your backside pressing buttons . You used to have to know how to fix an engine , how to gauge the wind but ... Leave it . Open this . Oh ! It 's beautiful . Well , how did it go ? This coat I 'm wearing is their latest fashion , ' 50s inspired . - They offered me a job on the spot . - Oh , that 's brilliant ! Now we need to find you a flat somewhere near here . The shop 's in a new branch in London . I 've always dreamt about working in a London fashion house . They open the day after Boxing Day . I 'll be a shop girl and a trainee buyer , and I can house-share . - They 've given me contact numbers . - London 's a big city . - That 's what my mum used to say . - There 's no rush . There 's nothing to keep me here . I 'm sure we can find you something in Cardiff . You keep looking . I need to make a plan , get work , get my driving licence . - It 'll all help . - Thanks , Jack . Uh , I was looking for a bus timetable . I wanna get out to the DIY store , see if there 's any work going . - Best of luck . - Thank you . - Where are you taking me ? - We 're here . Bear with me . Oh , we have had such a girly day shopping . What 's up ? Your mum rang . Mmm-hmm . Funny thing , she 's no idea who Emma is . No ? And I 'm thinking back to you and me on the couch , work calls , you go out in the middle of the night and come back with a surprise relative . So , let 's have it , who exactly is Pollyanna ? Aw , is it to do with work ? It 's so hard to explain . Do you even know her ? She was lost . I 'm sorry . What worries me is how easy it seems to be for you to lie to me , Gwen . It 's my fault . I 'll leave by tomorrow . You don 't have to go . She 's 18 years old . I couldn 't turn my back on her . It 's like two separate worlds . There 's Torchwood and then there 's real life . That 's why you 've got to let me go . I , uh , couldn 't help noticing you standing out here in that beautiful dress . This beautiful dress is a gift from my lover . Then he is a fool to let you go out in it alone . What shall we drink to ? Chance meetings . Let 's go home . - Hello ? - My car keys are missing . John was behind the counter earlier on and I can 't get hold of him . He 's going home . John ? John ! JOH N : Let me go ! You can 't just throw it away , not without trying . I 'm not as strong as you . You don 't understand . I do . I was born in the future . Lived in your past . My time has gone , too . Why are you doing this ? Speaking to me in bloody riddles , keeping me here when my wife is dead , my son is a shell ... John , you 're still young . - You can get work , make friends , start a family . - I did all that , Jack . Years ago . When I was meant to . - I wish I could say something ... - There 's nothing to say or do . - I can 't leave you here . - Then we 'll wait . The sun will rise , we 'll have some breakfast , take a walk . Yes . A new day . And I 'll suffer it all and smile and wag my tail . And then as soon as your back is turned , I 'll make sure I do it properly . Because I want to die . You don 't get reunited , John . It just goes black . - How do you know ? - I died once . - Who are you ? - A man , like you , out of his time , alone and scared . - How do you cope ? - It 's just bearable . It has to be . - I don 't have a choice . - But I do . If you want to help me , let me go with some dignity . Don 't condemn me to live . Are you scared ? Yes . You 're very quiet . I don 't know if I can do this any more . This isn 't how it works for me . I 've slept with enough women , I 've done the fuck buddies thing . This is not it . I can 't concentrate . All I see is you . All I can think about is what you 're wearing , what you 're thinking , what you 're ... What your face looks like when you come . It 's been , what , a week ? And , uh ... it 's like when I 'm not with you ... erm ... I 'm out of focus . How have you done this to me ? I 'm scared . I 'm fucking scared . I love you , too . The thing about love is that you 're always at its mercy . Emma , these are your tickets , okay ? On the back is your seat number , keep this with you at all times . I 've also got you a return , just in case . Now , don 't go talking to any strangers and phone me as soon as you get there , okay ? No ! I 'm not letting you do this . - I 'm not a possession , Owen . - You can 't do this . It 's madness . If I listened to everyone who told me that , I wouldn 't have broken any records . You don 't have to go . If I don 't , then I 'll always wonder what it 's like . London , Gwen ! Okay . Go on . Diane , you 're not thinking straight , we can talk about this . No , I 'm sorry , Owen . We can make this work , you belong here now , with me . - I belong in the sky . - Well , we can get you up in the sky . In a couple of months , you can fly whenever you want . Look , weather conditions are the same as the day we arrived . - That rift will open again . I can feel it . - Diane , listen to me , there is no way back . - You cannot get home . - Then it will take me somewhere new . Merry Christmas ! - I 'll come with you . - I fly solo , Owen . - I go faster and further than others . - We have no idea how this rift works . You could end up anywhere . - That 's the beauty of it . - It 's too dangerous ! - It 's what I do . - What about me ? Please . Please . Don 't go . What memories I 'm taking with me . Merry Christmas ! Because when you take off together , it 's the next best thing to flying . Somebody 's not only kidnapping weevils , they 're causing them pain . These guys are using weevils to carry out the perfect murder . You want to release a weevil in the middle of Cardiff ! I 've been having sex with someone else . H is name 's Owen . Who are you , Owen Harper ? We 're going to hunt you down , and we 're going to make you surrender that creature that you kidnapped . Out there in the darkness , something is coming .

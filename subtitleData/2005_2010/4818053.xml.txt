 This is ours ... Ours ... Our Basquash ! Now ! The stones will awaken ! Do it . 300 ) } ' CAUSE SLASH SAID SO What are you doing ? ! Who do you think I am ? I am the ruler of this land ! Dan ! Dan ! Fire ! Sela ! This way ! Sela ! Navi ! No ! Navi ! Wait . Don 't kill him . He 's mine . Dan . Be safe ... The tracery of the legend 's thunderbolt ... It 's the same as the ruins I saw before ... That pattern ... Those ruins were a path ... to the moon ... Navi ! What ? That 's ... Dawn ? The morning of the legend ... The planet is screaming ! Alan ? what 's wrong ? what is it ? Hold on ! It 's horrible ... The legend has only just begun . and the friction of their atmospheres ... and freak weather ... It 'll get worse . And after three weeks ... Yan used military force to take control of Skybloom and impose martial law . Don 't worry . The people will save us . Don 't you agree ? There 's no reason why they would . you stopped hearing your people . This is your reward . Answer me ... Princess ... No one 's sparing a thought for the imprisoned king . welcoming them in the hope that they will protect the country better than the unreliable royal family . Meaning Yan intended to take over Skybloom from the start ? Yes . And what he wants is ... My brother ? Missing . Coco . He 's overcome hurdles again and again . He 'll overcome this one too . if he 's the true legend . No sign that you 've ever undergone reinforcement ... Just how is it that you were able to activate the ultinium ore ? We 'll have to investigate this in more detail . so I can do whatever I like . What do you think you 're doing ? Shooting Dan and pulling a coup ... Violette . Still ! Dan 's shooting was caused by some confusion in the chain of command . The soldier who shot him will be punished . And it was not a coup . This is for the sake of the legend . It means that Yan was looking at the bigger picture . We weren 't able to create a legend . That 's not accurate . starting now . That 's ... A new legend . and it became possible to synthesize the legend bullet . Legend bullet ? a powerful explosive . In a few days we can secure as much as we need . and destroy the moon . That way Earthdash will be saved . No ... So what will happen to the moon ? ! My family ... my friends ... They 'll all be ... Yan is right . what are you saying ? You have family on the moon too ! both Earthdash and the moon are done for . It 's better to sacrifice the smaller number . Rouge . so it should make sense to you . and not worthy of existing . Yes . The two of us will convince Violette . For the sake of creating the legend . Citron . I imagine the unrest will continue for a while . it will fall to Eclipse to calm the people . Yes . didn 't it ? Princess ... Navi ... and we have no idea what 's going on . Although thanks to that we were able to meet up with you guys again . But with things like this ... That 's exactly why we 'll do everything we can do . I get the feeling that whole concert was a setup for calling out Dan 's basquash . Alan said something about that . She said it has something to do with the ruins being a path to the moon . I 'm gonna head back to Area Zero . then head for the ruins . Miyuki ! Dan is definitely okay . right ? Goes for Navi too . Got it . then head for the ruins . We 'll take a little detour and do the same ! Take care of things here ! huh ? Navi ... Idiot ! How could you stand there and say it was fine to sacrifice the moon ? Didn 't we explain ? It 's so we can create the legend ! Violette ! What are you doing ? No ! Let me go ! Calm down ! It was an act ? Jerks . Forgive us . We had to in order to lure Yan into revealing his true plans . And he could still be listening to us right now . Dan . but I bet Dan can . Yes . If anyone could ... Dan . Let 's rescue Dan . and the future . to rescue him ... Do we know where he is ? Can 't tell from just this data . Maybe I 'll open you up . Dan JD . The closest anyone has gotten to becoming the legend . But is that really the truth ? Too many uncertain elements swirl around him . Are you all right ? We definitely don 't have much time left . But I will bring forth the legend ! let us go forth . We shall rescue Dunk Mask . you know . True . But disbanding didn 't change you three . You are idols ! Yes ! Dan . Wait for me . I swear I 'll bring you out of there . Thanks for all your hard work ! Don 't mention it . We never thought Eclipse themselves would show up handing out thank-yous ! It really is different seeing you in person ! Pardon me ! may the legend stand upon your shoulders . Let us go ! Fair maidens — Dan ! The perfect pick . Dan ! I 'm Dan ! Right here ! die ! die ! Dan ! He 's not here . Where 's Dan ? ! What ? The laboratory ? Yes ... Yes ... Professor Thousand ... is about to dissect him ? Dissect him ... where they 're making some raisined parade thing and I got caught ! and — hey ! Who goes there ? Freeze ! You don 't get to eat Dan ! You ... Get your hands off of Dan ! Dan ! stupid-head ! Don 't you know I came all that way to see you ? ! I was nearly there ! But my investigation so far indicated nothing physically unusual about Dan . the legend 's power won 't ... hm ? Aren 't you a little too old for that ? Thought I 'd practice a talent f-for when we have a party ... I 'd rein in the cradle-robbing if I were you . falling . Radii roughly 5 meters . Estimated impact zone is central Skybloom . If we follow this waterway ... Alan ! Mr. Dan ... Why is this hurdle the one stopping him ? and he 's not the legend ! Alan ! Princess ! We have calculation results . The moon and Earthdash will collide in three days ! Mooneyes 's power system has been damaged by the gravitational forces . Power down 20 percent . We don 't have time to wait for Dan . If it falls to us to create the legend ... Initiating plan phase five ! Move quickly on the preparations . I 'll give the announcement immediately ! we have no choice . Dan wasn 't the legend . He 's not breathing ! Come on ! Hold on ! Princess ! Him ... Slash . Slash Keens . And I must share a grave truth with all of you on Earthdash and Mooneyes . This is the legend of creation passed down from ancient times . I 'm sure many of you have heard it . Earthdash and the moon were born from the gods ' ball game . the same stone was divided . ultinium ore the lingering remanant of the legend of creation . the two planets have maintained a safe distance until now . and very soon ... They will collide . C-Collide ? What 'll happen to us ? Moron ! so ... we collide ! However ! The legend does not end there . Dan ... Is Dan ... ? Dan ! If you die ... I can 't eat you raw any more ! Stupid Dan ! Wake up ! Hold on ! The stars and planets were born in the gods ' ball game . the gods ' power saves them . The giants ' power . Did he say giants ? The ones in the legend ? The great power . The legend . The savior in whose hands is the thunderbolt ball . The thunderbolt ball from the legend ? That 's ... Bigfoots . the legend states : What will save the planets is again ... a ball game . Basquash . Basquash . I get it ! Basquash ! It 's basquash ! Basquash ! Basquash ! Dan . What is the world going to do ? Yes . and save Earthdash and the moon ! That is the power of the legend ! We spent many years developing the Legend Project and have found potential successors to the legend . those potential successors will play in league matches . I hereby convene the Legend League ! Save ... the world ... Are you watching ? Are you listening ? all of you whose hands resides the thunderbolt ball — I am here on the moon ! Come and play against me ! Run ! Soar ! Climb every wall ! Come to me ! basquashers ! No ... That 's not it ... That 's not it . But if it saves you ... The legend overcomes every hurdle and only becomes brighter . Baaya . I understand . It 's beating ! Thank god ! Dan ! Stupid Dan ! Dan !

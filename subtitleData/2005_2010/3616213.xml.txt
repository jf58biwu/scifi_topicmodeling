 Do you think I look like a possum in this shirt ? - Not in that shirt . Why ? - My wife went on and on this morning ... about how this shirt makes me look like a possum . Well - Sometimes I don 't know how you put up with that woman . Usually , I hold perfectly still until she goes away . The company has a problem . A recent survey found employee morale has dropped from " low , " which they were okay with ... to " I 'd like to burn this place down " ... which , frankly , I 'm surprised was one of the options . This is Clark . He conducted the survey . Right now he 's telling Veronica what the employees think about her ... which means right now Veronica hates Clark . And 63 % found you too intimidating . Is there such a thing as " too intimidating " ? Is there ? Answer me , you little bean counter . I 've told you three times I don 't like being called that . Oh . Sorry . I was told my evaluation was at 11 : 00 . We 're done . It seems everyone 's afraid of me ... which to me sounds like their problem , but apparently not . The company is worried that a decrease in morale is hurting productivity . We think it would help if you soften your image a little . Compliment people . Be more supportive . If people feel appreciated , then they work harder . Veronica , I 'm sure we 're all gonna have to make adjustments . - Not you . - No ? You mean , everyone likes me ? - Oh , you so desperately wanna be loved . - No , I don 't . Yes , I do . I mean , who doesn 't ? Mr. Crisp , you had a near unanimous rating of " excellent . " In fact , there were even several write-ins of " adorable . " Oh , brother . Look out , Jesus . Wait . Uh , near unanimous . Does that mean a few less than unanimous or a few more ? Well , really , the only group you didn 't score well with were men over 50 and lower management . Too bad , Ted . Men over 50 and lower management loved me . - No , they didn 't . - Shut up , you little bean counter . Huh . I don 't get it . What did I do to men over 50 ? Well , you 're young , good-looking , successful . Honestly , they probably just resent you . Well , maybe I 'll just have to make them get to know me . I mean , my father 's over 50 , and he - I 'll wait . You wanted to see me , boss ? Yes , employee . As part of an effort to raise morale ... I 've been told to find out what would make our workers happy . And I thought I 'd ask you since you 're the smartest , most observant person ... - in the whole company . - Let me guess . - You 've also been told to compliment people . - See how smart you are ? Thank you . But what makes you think I know how to make employees happy ? Because you 're the suggestion-box lady . Well , that 's what they call you upstairs . I 've never put my name on any of my helpful but ignored ideas . - How do they know they 're from me ? - Other people suggested ... that you stop hogging the suggestion box . Oh . Okay . Well , sitting out there in those identical cubicles , people start to feel anonymous . There 's no sense of community . Personally , I 've always felt disconnected . Like I 'm just some faceless cog in a giant dehumanizing machine . Whoa . Slow down , Chairman Mao . I don 't need a manifesto . I need something to make people happy . Well , the company could start by letting us individualize our space ... you know , decorate our cubicles , put up photos and artwork . Really ? That 's all it would take ? You drones are so easy . That 's not a compliment . Good morning . Hey , Rick , I think I 've been replaced by someone who likes cats . Yeah , my cubicle 's been decorated with space stuff . It 's a very aggressive move . But by who ? Nice sweater , Lily . I support your decision to wear it . Hi , balding guy . I love what you 've done with the hair you have left . Hello , mob . You look confused . We were just wondering about our new and lovely cubicles . - Well , Linda suggested - - Oh , great . I love where this is going . that you all be allowed to decorate your workplaces to express your individuality . The company thought it would be too risky to let people do whatever the hell they wanted . So they have expressed your individuality for you ... in four exciting and inoffensive themes - Green Bay Packers , cats ... space and classic cars . Isn 't that great ? Enjoy your new personalities . Nice job , Linda . I know . Can you believe this place and the things they do to all of us sometimes ? Veridian Dynamics . Teamwork . It 's a beautiful thing . In business , it means working together for a common goal . X - rays show that when people work together , they 're happier ... and less likely to do something weird . Veridian Dynamics . Teamwork . It keeps our employees gruntled . What about me screams " cat lady " to you ? Maybe the way you pounce on a fella who 's just trying to get a cup of coffee . The company personalized my cubicle with all this stupid cat stuff . What are they trying to tell me , that I 'm gonna die old and alone ... with a hundred cats chewing on my decomposing body ? Well , maybe if you fed the cats once in a while ... your story would have a happier ending . Would you just say they 're wrong about me , please ? Because in spite of what my new poster says , I 'm having trouble hanging in there . Look , the company does all sorts of crazy things . That doesn 't mean we have to be crazy too . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to go seduce a 55-year-old man . - Hey . Manny , right ? I 'm Ted . - I know who you are . I have always heard so much about you . You 're practically a legend in this place . I can 't believe this is the first time we 've actually met . It 's not . We 've worked together on three projects before . I meant the first time we 've met outside of those three projects . It 's not . What do you want , Ted ? I wanna take you to lunch . Screw that . Just fire me now . I won 't make a scene . - Oh , no , no . It 's not like that . - Thirty years I give to this company . Thirty years , and this is how it ends ? Uh , " A , " inside voices , and " B , " no one 's firing you . I just wanna get to know you and you to know me . Hey , you can bring some friends if you like so they can , uh , know me too . Uh , okay . How about Bill and Jeremy ? Uh , yeah . Don 't you have any friends who are , you know , older ? Hey , guys . I just want you both to know that you 're doing great work . Your specs on the robotic firefighting technology ... really blew my mind . That 's got to feel good , right ? Boost your morale ? Wow . Thank you , Veronica . Thank you , Veronica . You 're welcome . And , Phil , I like that outfit . That was incredible . - I 'm , like , tingly . - Our specs weren 't that great . I reject her compliment . - Then can I have your half ? - It doesn 't mean anything . She 's only saying nice things because the company ordered the executives to boost our morale . Then you shouldn 't have any trouble giving up your half . Hey , Linda . I see the company made you a cat person too . Yeah , well , the company can go lick its ass . I 'm sorry . I just don 't see myself as a cat person . I know . Neither did I. But then I realized that they 're not saying that we 're cat people . I mean , that 's insane . They 're saying we 're cats . - Oh , Sheila . - Oh , I don 't mean actual cats . They 're saying we share the same qualities . Cats are quick , smart and independent , just like you , me , Debbie and Bruce . Huh . You think I 'm quick , smart and independent ? Everybody does . We 've all talked about it . Really ? I never thought of myself in cat terms ... but I do like to think I have those attributes . Or should I say " cattributes " ? - Cattributes . Can I use that ? - No . It 's mine . What 's wrong with this picture ? Five steaks , one Caesar salad , low-fat dressing on the side . I like a light lunch . Keeps me sharp for the rest of the day . Oh , hey , look at Mr. Perfect . Mr. Stays Awake at Work . Ted , you 're so put together . It 's like you stepped out of a magazine . Didn 't you ever get a mustard stain on your shirt ... or a hooker 's vomit on your pants ? Well , I-I did do one of those things when I was 12 , at a baseball game . I won 't tell you which one it is , but it was the game of my life . Look , fellas , I can have fun . Oh , yeah ? What are you drinking , iced tea ? In our day , it was okay to knock back a few at lunch . Okay . Tell you what . I can go old school . Drinks all around . From now on , you can call me Mr. Has a Drink at Lunch ... But Let 's Not Go Overboard Because It 's Still a Workday . I know . It 's long , but it makes some good points . Hey , Linda . Have you met Debbie , Bruce and Rita ? They 're also cat people . Oh , hi . Sure . I 've seen some of you around , but we 've never actually met . - Now we all have something in common . Being surrounded by pictures of cats has made me realize how much I want one . I hate myself for being allergic . Oh . Hey , uh , have you guys seen that YouTube video thatJanet sent around ... with the cat that flushes the toilet ? - No . I didn 't get that . - No . Oh , it 's really cute . He thinks he 's people . Well , it turned out it wasn 't the school 's mascot . It was just some random pig I 'd stolen . This guy 's hilarious . And what an operator . Comes back from lunch with the hostess 's phone number . I am totally gonna make love to her . Oh , you would have loved it back in the old days , Teddy . There was no such thing as sexual harassment . There was nothing sweeter than telling some broad who wouldn 't do you ... to clean out her desk , put her crap in a box and go home . Well , gee , that-that sounds great . Well , you be sure to tell everyone in your age group how much fun you had . Uh , tomorrow will be even better . You are part of the group now . Tomorrow we 're taking you to lunch . Yeah . Bring some dollar bills and a lap . I just made three new friends . Maybe I was wrong about the cubicle themes . For the first time since I 've been here , I actually feel like I 'm part of something . Glad to hear it . I have to go to a strip club tomorrow with a bunch of old men . Wow . What theme did the company give you ? Veronica and her hair were working hard ... on the company 's campaign to improve morale . They both put on a good front , but one of them was feeling frustrated ... and the other was feeling dry and flaky . - You guys wanted to see me ? - Hi , Veronica . We isolated rat R.N.A. using T.R.I. Reagent . Would you like to see it ? Sure . Wow . That is very impressive . Nice work . Wait . Let me turn it on . Wow . That is very impressive . Nice work . And thanks for calling me down here to see it . Nice work on that too . I could listen to her praise me all day . It 's not real , Phil . Any grad student can isolate rat R.N.A. And I looked at our average specs from the other day . I rejected her compliment then , and I re-reject it now . Well , excuse me . Some of us aren 't married to my wife . I 've got to grab whatever compliments I can get . I 'm sorry , but when I hear an undeserved compliment , it makes my ears wanna throw up . Oh , your ears are always throwing up about something . I can 't believe you guys got me a kitten . Linda had finally found that sense of community she 'd been missing . Janet on the fourth floor , also a cat person , was giving them away . - We thought you 'd want one . - And they thought right , didn 't they , Boots ? No . Sandals ? No . I should get away from footwear . - Stapler . No . Now I 'm just looking at things on my desk . Oh , ho , ho ! That 's good , Teddy . It 's great having a strong , young friend around . How do you know when your need to be liked has become unhealthy ? Do me . Do me next . Seriously , how do you know ? Because clearly , I 'm having trouble finding the line . Hello , space people . - Is this space taken ? - Houston , we have a problem . Um , I guess not . Oh . Janet upstairs is giving away the cutest kittens . - Have you guys seen them ? - Houston , we have a problem . - What 's that , Joe ? - It 's just we were talking about space stuff . - Oh . - It might be over your head by 50 miles . That 's where space starts . I know where space starts , Joe . It 's not like you 're in a secret club . - Houston , we have - - Shut up , Joe . Linda , why are you sitting over here ? All of us cat people have our own table . I don 't know . I thought I 'd mix it up a little ... see what the other groups are up to , check out the final frontier . So , I heard Pluto 's not a planet anymore . How do we feel about that , fellas ? Yeah , but , Linda - Linda ? Linda ? - What ? - It 's just that I thought we were friends . You know . Cats of a feather . We are friends , but I also wanna be friends with other people . Did you just say " cats of a feather " ? Yes . If you were sitting at our table ... you would have seen the shirts that Bruce made for us . Sheila , it 's just one lunch . I can 't believe you 're making such a big deal out of this . I 'm not . But we gave you a cat , Linda . A cat . You 're disgusting . Hey , Veronica . I haven 't seen you in the lunchroom before . Don 't be silly . I 'm down here all the time . What 's that smell ? It 's my plate . Yum . Yeah , the food here is not very good . I like to say even the salt needs salt . You 're a very funny man , Phil . - You think ? - Yes . In fact , I think you 're " philarious . " My wife says I wouldn 't know comedy if it ripped my face off . Good for you for having a wife . What happened , Linda ? Looks like the cats abandoned you like you abandoned them . Yeah . They abandoned you . I hope they didn 't leave you any little gifts on the seat of your car . My car 's in the shop , Debbie . I didn 't drive today . That 's right . You better run . I 'm gonna mess you up . - Hey , Teddy ! Join us . - Guys , what 's going on ? Well , I was hoping foreplay . All right , this party is over . Aw , Ted . Don 't be that guy . That-That uptight guy we thought you were . You know what ? I am that guy . The guy you want me to be gets taken advantage of . So I 'm this guy , and this guy wants all of you out of my office . And why is that sticky ? Where 's the frackin ' aspirin ? Oh , here it is . Good job , cabinet . God , I must stop . This will kill everything . Right ? Yeah . That 's why we weren 't allowed to sell it . - I 'm losing my mind , Ted . - Oh , yeah ? I just saw Bob Gershon 's butt . I think it touched my desk . I 've been saying so many nice things to people , I 've started making words up . This morning I called Phil " magniflorious . " About Phil - he 's falling in love with you . And if that doesn 't sound " horriflivic , " I don 't know what does . Oh , God . See , that 's why I keep my hair up . It creates a distance , an unapproachability . Oh , I miss that me . I don 't know who I am anymore . Hey , you know who you are ? You are a great boss who gets things done . - That should be all that matters . - Well , thank you . And you shouldn 't be wiping wrinkly butt prints off your desk . I know . I shouldn 't care what men over 50 think about me ... except my father , and that ship has sailed . - You 're right . - About my father ? Why , did he say something to you ? No . I 'm talking about the people around here . You can 't win with some of them anyway . I found cat feces in my car . Speaking of cat-related vandalism - - What are you doing ? - Oh ! Clearly , I 'm losing my mind . I thought decorating the cubicles would create this great sense of community . But you can 't base a community on made-up personalities . That 's like high school , only no one 's on drugs and everyone 's trying to get pregnant . The druggie teen slut is right , Ted . - Wha - Hey . - I said you were right . - It 's time to pull the plug on this madness . - Agreed . Drones . Can I have your attention ? Something tells me I should have known you in high school . I actually went to an all-girl school and was totally straight . But I 'm very trampy now . Recently , we 've tried doing things a little - I have never seen you this excited about schematics before . Well , now that I 've redone them , I think they 're some of my best work . I finally have something worthy of Veronica 's praise . And since , unlike you , I 've earned this moment , I 'm going to enjoy it . And while it may have been a worthy experiment , it is now over . And so , from now on , there will be no more praise ... and I will no longer be complimenting any of you . Damn it ! Unless it is truly your best work . Damn it ! And the next time some survey asks how happy you are ... you check " very " ... or I 'll give you something to be happy about . I 'm not sure that makes any - The hair is up . That 's all they hear . And so , things got back to normal . - Hi , Phil . - Veronica . Phil , I think we need to talk . - Sweet . - Look , you are a very nice man . I like hearing that . That is , I like you as a friend . Step one , check . Phil , nothing is ever gonna happen with us . I see . And now I must get out of the room as quickly as possible . Wait . Another time , another place , two other people ... it could have been " magniflorious . " You mean that ? I do . Especially the part about two other people . Shh , shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh . And things got back to normal for Linda too ... although she did get that sense of community she was looking for . Unfortunately , it was centered around blaming her for getting things back to normal . And as for me , I kind of like the idea ... of not caring what people think of me . - Hey , Manny . - Go to hell , Ted . Will do . English - US - SDH

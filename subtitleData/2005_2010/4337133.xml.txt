Rich and Daughtery gathered evidence of the new species and showed it to the world . To the top of the Countdown now , and we conclude with a wild tale of what lies beneath . Do you think it could be a left over dinosaur ? Partly . Within six months , we will be on the brink of an ecological disaster . Want us to bring them in ? NARRATOR : But Lee will do anything to shut them down . We 're past that . MAN : Front desk . I have a fax here for you . NARRATOR : Now , Surface continues . ( KNOCKING ) RICH : Wait . LAURA : What ? Nobody knows we 're here . So who 's gonna send us a fax ? I don 't know Ann or the network or something ? AII right , tell him to slip it under the door though . Yeah , can you slip it under the door , please ? I need a signature , ma 'am . Since when do they need a signature for a fax ? That Iatch . ( BANGING ON DOOR ) Rich ! hold it ! I am ! What are you doing ? I 'm leaving . It 's tight , it 's tight , it 's tight . Fourth floor . Room directly below . AII right . Okay , okay . Check all the stairwells ! I 'm on it ! AII right . No one 's in the hall . But , you know , I think we should wait it out . They ain 't gonna be fooled for long . We 're better off making a run for it . I 'm telling you . Come on , Iet 's go . Here . ( GRUNTING ) LAURA : Oh ! Keep going ! Go downstairs , go ! Wait ! What ? Get outta here ! Go ! Get going ! I 'II catch up .

( WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA SYSTEM ) remarkable . No indication of a bite wound at all . Temperature 's normal . So , what was it , mitchell ? You said you 'd know better once the lab results were in . FUO ? What 's that ? We 're still calling it a " fever of unknown origin " . Meaning you have absolutely no idea what happened . You lucked out . well , forgive me , but that 's not very reassuring . Mom . could I just have a moment alone with Dr. Ashton ? Oh , um , sure . ( MAN CHATTERING ) So I was just wondering about that " unknown origin " part . Is it possible that my fever was caused by some physiological change ? Maybe a tissue anomaly like a collagen vascular or granulomatous disease ? You were just " wondering " this ? I Iooked some stuff up online . miles , we had a pretty intense scare , you and I. So just tell me . What 's on your mind ? Is it possible that if some weird thing bites you , that your body changes ? Like , you become like it in some way ? You 're 1 4 , miles , your body changes daily , and some of those changes are pretty strange . We don 't need any granuIomatous disease or anything else to explain it , it 's just life . Stand up . You 're fine . perfectly normal . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Hey , Laura ! Where have you been ? I 've been trying to get in touch with you all morning . I know . We couldn 't get to a phone . well , the feedback from the show has been phenomenal . Countdown was bombarded with all sorts of emails and responses ... Oh , my God , Rich , are you okay ? Yeah . Something 's happened . I don 't understand why these people would be after you ? No , not just people , okay ? We 're talking about the Agency of Strategic intelligence . Did they show a warrant or a subpoena ? ( SCOFFS ) Uh , no , these guys are more like , uh , the mob . well , what were they gonna do ? I mean , the story 's already out there . They can discredit the story . We 're the only living witnesses . That 's right . And it 's the " living " part they got a problem with . Wow . Okay . This is getting scary . And interesting . Let me go to the office , make some calls . Jack Cooper at SOCOM . Wait , wait . Jack Cooper ? Who 's that ? Uh , he 's a Marine colonel , a friend I can trust , someone who might be able to make some sense out of this . But you don 't tell him we 're here . No . You have my word . Okay . And in the meantime , you guys make yourself at home . Not much in the fridge , but it 's all yours , okay ? AII right ? I 'II call you later . Yeah , yeah . Oh , wait , we ain 't answering your phone . well , I 'II ring once and then let it hang up and you pick it up after that . Okay , that 's good . AII right ? Thank you , Ann . Thank you . You really think they were gonna kill us ? Damn right I do . AII I can think about is just Jesse . When am I gonna see Jesse again ? That 's all I can think about . Okay , we 've been through this , all right ? You wanna see Jesse , I want to see my little girls , but we both know if we try to contact them , we 're only putting them at more risk . I mean , they found us at a dang hotel , for goodness ' sakes . Now , your friend , she 's asking the right questions . Did they have a subpoena ? No . Did they give us a search warrant ? Uh-uh . I 'm telling you right now those guys would 've thrown us off that balcony if they 'd had half a chance . They probably killed Jackson . You don 't know that . well , where the hell is he , then ? Why hasn 't he tried to contact us ? We are onto something big . Something bigger than my brother . Something bigger than a new species . Okay ?

When do I get to meet " Mr. Big " ? Soon enough . What 's that ? Wait , wait , wait . What 's ... I need to sweep you as a final precaution . Legs apart , please . But , um , after all that you 've put me through , you really think that I 'm here to bust you ? " That which we intend is not always that which we accomplish . " Just ask Lisa Meitner . Lisa Meitner . Austrian physicist , right ? Uh-huh , yep . She escaped the Nazis in 1939 and went on to discover nuclear fission . She envisioned a world made prosperous by unlimited atomic energy . Instead , they hijacked her research to develop an atomic weapon . You 're him , aren 't you ? Who ? " Mr. Big . " SHERIFF : ... information regarding this creature . How long has that thing been here ? A week ? A month ? You didn 't tell anybody ? PAUL : We had no idea what it is . We didn 't know it was the same species that attacked those boys . I get a report about this kid over by Drawbridge . Fourteen or 15 , hospitalized just last week in another attack . This thing is starting to become an epidemic . We just want ... It was you , wasn 't it ? The boy who was hospitalized was you . Paul , give us something to work with here . You 've got to help us a little bit . It 's okay , miles . No . It 's not .

You have the gene that increases your risk of heart disease ? Hmm . I was messing around with my own code one Sunday and there it was . The gene . The corporation wouldn 't approve . What corporation ? You don 't need to worry about that . There really is no corporation , it 's a Iong story . samples . I thought this was a whole , you know , government cover-up , and ... There is no government cover-up . Of course , I 'm sure there are agents within ... What ? But the government is largely ignorant of the scope of the situation . So , you work for this nonexistent corporation . Yes . After a while you start to wonder if maybe you don 't exist . The samples . Right . Sorry . Here . Here 's my part of the deal , and then your part is to just give me some answers . Uh , does the corporation have a name ? Not a name . It has hundreds of names . shells within shells ... The worlds left to plunder aren 't out there anymore , they 're in here . Okay . But what 's your specialty ? RNA enzymes . I alter them . To do what ? To function like scissors . Snip out flawed gene segments . splice in corrected new versions . I envisioned a world where tissue could seIf-repair overnight . Maybe not in my lifetime , but someday . You envisioned a world where your work would be used for good . silly me . Those are my artificial chromosomes in your new vertebrate . I 'm sorry , are you saying that this ... Are you saying that this creature was designed ? I prefer the word engineered . Um ... You built this thing ? Me and , I 'm just guessing here , about 2,500 others . You made this animal ? Why ? Why would you ... Why would you do such a thing ? Because we could .

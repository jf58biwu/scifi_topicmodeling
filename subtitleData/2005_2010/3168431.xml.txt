Hey , ambacher ! - Vasser . - You can 't do it . You can 't cut 25 percent of the newspaper 's staff ; you 'll kill it . I 'm not killing anything . I 'm eliminating inefficiencies . Yeah , inefficiencies like me . Look , let 's not make this personal . Oh , it 's pretty personal already . All right , since you asked .

Oh , what smells so good ? - We made cookies . - We did . Hey , zack , can you help theresa put the presents under the tree ? - Okay . - Thanks Jack , can I talk to you for a second ? - Yeah . - Thanks . Those cookies do smell good . Did you run wild with the fennel seeds again ? Yeah , listen , your mom just called . She 's at the station . Dan was supposed to get a cab and pick her up , But i guess he never showed up . Any idea where he went ? - No . - That 's not good . What 's going on ? Oh , it 's just , like , a little mix-Up with the reception committee for my mom . Not a problem , I 'll get her . I thought dan was going to do that ? He probably flaked . Don 't worry , I 'll be back in half an hour .. Thanks The hostages in the american embassy in tehran were Gathered together this evening by their captors ... I wonder what he 's thinking . Are you okay ? Yeah . The last time I saw you , you had a hole in your shoulder and a fever of 105 . So why do I think that 's not true ? I 'm fine ... granted , I still can 't raise my arm all the way over my head . And whenever I try and talk to katie about aeden bennett She starts baking , oh , and I got fired . Apart from that , happy holidays . Fired ? Why ? My work product 's down because instead of filing stories in 2007 , I 've been in 1982 and ' 77 and 1994 , solving other people 's problems . I 'm sorry , dan . Yeah , well , let 's just do the job . So we keep old man ambacher alive , And if that means keeping his pants zipped , and , okay , gross ... But looks like that 's the assignment . No , I don 't think that 's it . I don 't care what people say , nancy stokes didn 't sleep with merritt ambacher to get her job . She 's too smart , too good . She didn 't need that kind of help . Okay , so we keep the old man alive without worrying about his zipper . I think it 's something else . What ? My dad . Maybe ... Getting him to stay with my mother . You know that 's not how this works , dan . Why not ? Because you don 't change your own future . It 's bad news . I don 't think the news could get much worse . You really want to find out ? I 'm not going off-Mission , liv . I think I am here to talk to him . Fine . Go . What ? I don 't know what to say . Does dan talk about his father ? - Frank ? - Not much . Jack never talks about him . Every time I bring him up , he makes a joke or changes the subject . I guess I 'm trying to understand the vasser male , And in my experience , the dad is a good place to start . Well , frank 's kind of a charged subject , I guess . He was a photographer at the register . A war correspondent , so he was , you know , a very romantic figure when they were boys . He was on assignment so much , barbara essentially had to raise jack and dan on her own . And then when dan was , um , Dan was seven , jack was nine , he finally left for good . You know , just packed a bag , took off . I think that was probably the last time dan and jack ever saw him . Why did he leave ? All barbara says is that he had " other things to do . " Oh . What do you want to do with this ? Um ... I am just going to take that upstairs . I was in the middle of my christmas eve when I got yanked here , and I 'd kind of like to get back . So I 'm going to go check on the old man and see if maybe he 's the mission . - Okay ? - All right . Hi there . Can I get you a drink ? No thank you . Excuse me . MR.Ambacher ? Excuse me . Hi , livia beale . I 'm here with a friend who works for the paper . Oh , pleasure , ms . Beale . Thank you for adding some much needed elegance to the evening . Oh , thank you . You know , I remember when all these parties were black tie . Of course , that was way before your time , I 'm afraid . How are you feeling ? Fine , thank you . - Yourself ? - I 'm good . I 'm good . So , you 're feeling well . As opposed to not well . That 's right . - That 's good . - Here you go , sir . - Ah , thank you . - You 're welcome . Nancy stokes , livia beale . - Hello . - Hi . Ms. Stokes is a very talented young lady who 's recently joined our staff . Thank you , sir . Well , congratulations . I 'm going to go get a drink . It was really nice to meet you both . - Carson . - Yes ... frank ? - Who is she ? - Who ? The woman you 're with . What 's her name ? Uh , livia . - She 's not with me . Not like that . - Mmm . 'Course not . 'Cause you 're wearing one of these and ... she isn 'T . It 's not what you think . Don 't worry , I 'm not gonna narc on you . Merry christmas . - Hi . - Hey . Okay , I know how you feel about nancy stokes , But she 's on the prowl and I think old man ambacher is up for some game , too . Are you sure ? He practically jumped down my dress . Well , I could understand that . My point being , the elements of a crime are in place . We need to keep an eye on those two . Hello again . Excuse me again . Oh , you 're not getting away that easily . - I think I am . - We were talking . I saw her first , pal . You what ? Do you know who I am ? No . I 'm dennis ambacher . - You 're dennis ? - That 's right . And this is my party . So back off , or you 're going to regret it . Son of A ... You know , dennis ... That felt good . You all right ? My locket . My locket 's gone . Do you see it ? This ? Liv ? Hey ! We 're here . Hello ! Hi ! - Grandma ! - How are you , kiddo ? How do you like the decorations ? Oh , they 're wonderful . Your mom puts up so many . Makes everything so fancy . Hey , mom , I 'd like you to meet theresa . How do you do ? Oh , it 's a pleasure , theresa . Jack 's told me almost nothing about you , but then of course he never does . Good times . Thanks , mom . Um , I 'm sorry about dan , I think he got stuck in traffic . - Traffic ? - Jack said it was a flat tire . Well , I mean , of course traffic and then he got a flat tire . Uh-Huh , really ? No , mom . They 're covering for me . I overslept . Danny . Oh , never mind that . Well , how are you ? I mean , have you healed ? I can 't believe you got shot in your own home . I 'm fine . I tell you about it later . But I got to go to work right now , I 'm sorry . Why ? Something came up . Hey , jack , could you help , um , barbara upstairs with her things ? Zack , why don 't you help your uncle , okay ? - I want to see his room . - Can I talk to you ? Hey . You were already at the paper once today . Is this work or the other thing ? Both . Sort of . Can you tell me anything about it ? I 'll tell you tonight . And I promise , I 'll try and get back as soon as I can . Don 'T.Stop it . Don 't promise me that when you don 't know . - Katie ... - I 'm sorry . It 's just , it 's christmas , you know ? And , and , and your mother 's here and ... I miss you . - Hey . - Hey . What , you did your reappearing act upstairs ? Very nice . You make me look like a liar to mom . I arrive where I arrive , jack . I can 't control that . I 'm sorry . Now , could you do me a favor and pull out the police records of the death of merritt ambacher , December 24th , 1979 ? Dan , it 's christmas eve , I 'll be lucky if anybody answers the phone . Do what you can , okay ? Thanks . I just heard . I am so sorry . No , it stinks . But , you know , I could be on the unemployment line with you by the end of the day . You know , I wonder about that . Nancy , you knew merritt ambacher , didn 't you ? The old man ? No . You sure ? You were here when he ran the place , weren 't you ? Yeah , but I was a copy girl , he was the publisher . Wasn 't a lot of mingling . I actually never laid eyes on the man . - Why do you ask ? - Uh , just curious . - Again , sorry . - Sure . So ? I got a police file from 30 years ago pulled on christmas eve and read to me over the phone . - You owe me . - So , what you got ? Okay , call came in from the paper at 10 : 07 saying someone had had a heart attack . The emts and uniforms responded . Ambacher was dead when they arrived at 10 : 19 . - Is that it ? - There 's one weird thing . The call that came in was anonymous . Which is strange because it had to be somebody who knew him . Or worked for him . Yeah . Was there a tape of the call ? Uh , not on christmas eve there 's not . I told you , you owe me , right ? Yeah , you did . Carson . How are you ? Uh , great . Uh , this is maggie . Hi . I 'M ... going to get another drink . Do you want one ? - You ? - No , thanks . Believe it or not , she wants to be a journalist . Oh , yeah ? How 's your family , frank ? Fine . Home , decorating the tree . It 's christmas eve . Aren 't they expecting you ? No , not at this point . I 'm gone so much , it 's when I show up that freaks them out . No , they 're , uh , they 're fine . You know , my dad was in the newspaper business . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Yeah , he was always out chasing a story . We 'd get a call , sometimes . - Postcard . - It 's not a job , it 's a life . - You know that . - Yeah . I remember , when I was a kid , I ... Just lay in bed at night and ... Just wish my dad would come home . Your dad is he , uh , still around ? Where 's he , uh , where 's he work ? - I don 't know . - He left when I was seven . Excuse me . Yeah . - How 's it going ? - You were right . The old man is the job . I guess nancy was with him when he died . What changed your mind ? I talked to nancy in 2007 and she lied to me about meeting him . Then let 's get out of here and save the old man . I just need a couple more minutes with frank . It 's five after 9 : 00 and the old man won 't even be in trouble for another hour . Sure . But let 's get the job done , all right ? Does , um ... That mean getting back to him ? I 'm thinking that explains the dress . His name is henry . We were on a date when I left . - Is it serious ? - Hey ! What are you doing ? Everybody just stay calm . You are leaving this building now . Listen , I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have popped off . Please , just let us stay . We won 't cause any more trouble . Put them outside . And if they try to come back in , call the cops . Ambacher , wait , hey , hey . What the hell ? What 's going on here ? Don 't worry , dad , I 've got it under control . Got what under control ? What have you done , dennis ? Nothing ... the guy took a swing at me , so I 'm putting him out . Nothing to worry about , dad . Took a swing after he took a swing at me . I don 't know you . Who invited you ? I did , merritt . Dan 's a friend . - So he 's with you , frank ? - Yeah . Frank vasser 's guest is my guest . - Dad ... - Let him go , boys . Sorry for the trouble . Please don 't do this to me . Don 't do what ? Can you just let me handle it ? Instead of ... In front of everybody . A guy takes a swing at you , And you need security to finish the fight ? Grow a pair , dennis . Back to the party , everybody ! Hey , thanks . I want to talk to you about your dad . Barbara ? Everything okay ? Of course , dear . But the back chairs are lined up right behind the front chairs . So that the people in the second row will be staring at the heads of the people in front . So by scooting them off center just a little bit everybody 's going to be able to see . Well , thank you . No problem . Are you sure you don 't want a nap ? 'Cause I know , um , it was a long trip . - No , I 'm fine . - Maybe just a little rest . No , I wouldn 't think of it . Katie , what are these ? They 're fantastic . Those are figs and goat cheese wrapped in pistachios . Oh . You mind if I take a few dozen home ? Katie is wonderful in the kitchen . She 's always surprising us with arugula or , Or something with pine nuts in it or milky cheese . I like my cheeses . Well , I just wondered all the work , dear . People are perfectly , happy with chips and dip , you know . Yeah . Is it just my imagination , Or does your mom have a target painted on my back a little sooner than usual this year ? It 's not your imagination . Katie ... you heard from dan yet ? No . But we shouldn 't wait for him . Got some rolls here I shot a few years back in florida When I was covering nasa . Took the family with me . Things were better then . Nasa . You covering the shuttle prototype ? Yeah , that 's right . Here 's the wife and kids . That 's jack . Dan . Barbara . When your dad left . How 'd you ... How 'd you take it ? I was seven . Yeah , it 's always tough , I guess . You think there 's any way boys that age can understand , You know , why their , uh , why their dad has to leave ? I don 't know . Why does he have to leave ? Maybe because he 's not much of a father . Or husband . - That 's too easy . - Easy ? Guy 's got people who love him , depend on him , why does that guy have to disappear ? Maybe ' cause he only really sees people like this . Take the camera away , and it 's like he 's not in the room . Especially to the people he 's supposed to be closest to . And the harder he tries to get close ... The more he can 'T.It 's like he 's a freak in his own house . I know what it 's like to be the freak in the house . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Lately some things have happened , Made me feel even more like I 'm out on the edge , you know ? - Away from everybody . - That 's right . That 's it . I 'd never leave my family . How could you do that ? Easy . You walk . You know , frank , those boys are going to ... Think about you every day . Wonder where you are , imagine what you 're doing , Dream about birthdays with you and ball games ... You think about that before you walk , okay ? Hey . I 've been looking for you . You were going to take my picture . Yes , I was . Stick around , frank . See you later , carson . A car 's pulled up . Oh , that 's probably the florist . - I 'm going to go help them . - Yes , go ahead , dear . And by the way , I haven 't painted a target on your back . Or anywhere else , for that matter . Old does not mean deaf . - Barbara , look ... - Katie , You make dan happy and you 've given me the most beautiful grandchild in the world . And for those things I am grateful . But first you hurt jack . Now , I guess all the rest of you are fine with it , so I don 't say anything , but ... It still matters to me . - It 's complicated . - Of course it 's complicated . So why don 't you go help with the flowers , And I 'll finish cleaning up in here . Barbara ... Oh , katie , do you have a sweater I could borrow ? Yeah , um , upstairs in the bedroom , sweetie . Thanks . Hey . You okay ? I 'm fine . What are you doing ? Uh , I 'm sorry . - Katie said you were cold . - I 'm sorry . I , I was just ... Checking out your brother 's meds . Snooping . Did I say I was sorry ? I 'm sorry . - What were you looking for ? - Don 't be a cop , jack . I am a cop . What were you looking for ? Anti-Psychotics , anti-Convulsants . Anxiety or mood disorder meds . Because you think dan 's crazy . I think he might be mentally ill , yes . He 's not . Okay , and if he were , it wouldn 't be any of your business . - Yes , it would . - Look , theresa , I like you . Okay , I like you a whole lot , but you are a guest in my brother 's house . No , jack , I 'm actually a lot more than that . There are studies linking mental disorders to dna . If it 's part of dan 's makeup it could be part of yours . What , you 're worried that if dan 's crazy I might be crazy , too ? No . I 'm worried about our child . You 're kidding . No . Oh , this is so not how or when I wanted to tell you , but ... I just took the test this morning And I didn 't want to ruin your family 's christmas and ... Hey , we got to split . - What , why ? - Something came up . Sorry . - Jack . - It 's all right . - We have a problem . - It 's 9 : 30 . We got to find nancy and get her out of here before she has a date with ambacher . We can 'T.Nancy 's gone . She left . What ? Did you speak to her ? No , she left on her own . And the old man 's in his office , and I don 't know who 's with him . What the hell 's going on , dan ? We got to get up there . Ambacher ! Open the door ! Ambacher ! Dennis , what happened ? Dennis ? He 's warm . He might still be breathing . We need to call 911 right away . Don 'T.I 'll call . - It 's a family matter . - We need to get your father some help . I said I 'll call . Do you understand what 's happening here ? Dan . He 's dead . I 'd like to be alone with my father . Let 's go . Merry christmas ! Welcome . Come on in . I 'm zack 's grandmother . Mom , people are arriving . Okay . You be careful . Don 't you fall . They 're so excited ... Hi ! Hey , everyone . Merry christmas ! Welcome . Hi . Hello . So ... - Congratulations . - Thanks . I want you to know that I 'm , I 'm in for this , okay ? Because this is something that I wanted . I mean granted this is not the way that thought it would play out , but I don 't care . I just think you should know that . Thanks , jack . But ? I don 't know how I feel about this ... Or us . What are you saying ? I don 't know you . I , I mean , you 're great to be with And you would probably make a wonderful father , But we haven 't been together for that long And you have a pretty strange family and ... I just feel like I 'm getting into something that I don 't understand . Vasser . When ? Forget it . Call chase or menzel . Because I can 'T . Because it 's christmas eve and I can 't go . Yeah . That 's right . - Fine . - Trouble ? It 's a cat in a tree . - Well , you should go . - No , I should be here . Unless you , you want to go . - Do you want me to take you home ... - No . No , uh , no . No , it 's , it 's christmas eve . I 'd like to spend it with you . All right . So we weren 't supposed to save merritt ambacher . I don 't think so . Then we 're done ? I better come up with a good story for henry . I should have told you about him . Sorry . I didn 't tell you about katie so fast . No , you didn 'T . There 's so much i can 't say to henry . About who I am , where I 've been . That television 's not just a fad . The more I lie the harder it gets . Is it easier since you u told katie ? More honest . Easier , I don 't know . Maybe we just can 't be with other people . Be right back . Frank . So what are you going to do ? I don 't belong there , carson . Then tell the boys why you 're doing it . If you don 't , they 'll spend the rest of their lives thinking it was their fault . See you . Merry christmas , frank . So if we weren 't here to save ambacher , why were we here ? I think so I could save something else . Save what ? Nancy . Dennis ambacher is going to gut this paper in 20 minutes . If you want to help me stop that from happening , follow me . You didn 't sleep with old man ambacher . You made a deal with his son . - With dennis ? - Yeah . What kind of a deal ? He needed an alibi for the night that his father died , So you let him spread a rumor that the old man was with you , So no one would think that dennis was in that room . Wow . That 's a pretty wild story , danny . Why would I do that ? 'Cause you wanted to be a reporter , nancy . Dennis agreed to make you one . Maybe it 's a good thing you 're leaving the paper . You should write fiction . You could have shot that story down any time . You weren 't even in the building when he died . How do you know that ? Believe me , I just know . Whatever I did to start out , I 've earned my career . I was a pulitzer finalist . I have an overseas press club award . But if this story gets out , nobody will remember anything else about me ... Forget it . 50 of your friends are about to lose their jobs . We can stop that . Excuse me Why did you come here that night , dennis ? - What ? - To yell at your father , ask him to treat you better , demand ... I don 't know ... respect ? What are you talking about ? Christmas eve , 1979 . The old man must have told you he wasn 't feeling well . Did he mention chest pains ? That he had a tingling sensation down his left arm ? I know what you did , ambacher . You sat in this room , and you watched your father die . Call off the cuts . Nobody gets fired . Blackmail . From you . Interesting . - What if I just told you to go to hell ? - Then I tell your family . They hear what I have to say , They 'll sue those shares you bought right out of your hands . What 's your proof ? You made a 911 call and left an anonymous message . - I have the tape . - Really ? If a call had been made That a man was sick in the publisher 's office , That would have gone directly to the precinct desk . And they tape nothing . Get out of here , vasser . You go quickly , I won 't have you arrested . You told me what happened . - Told me no one could know . - All right , nancy . Don 't do this . And you told me that I could be a reporter If I just did one thing for you . So what 's it going to be , dennis ? And I 'm aware that there have been rumors about layoffs and such , And I just wanted to come down here myself and assure everyone ... There 's no truth to them . There will be no staff cutbacks in the foreseeable future . So , happy holidays , And let 's get back to work putting out the best newspaper in america . All right , what do you know about this ? Not a thing . Why don 't I believe you ? Gloria ... Congratulations . Ken . Thank you . Thank you . Katie ? Are you okay ? Yeah . Sorry . I just ... Had a moment . A moment ? The , um ... Man who came to the house who shot dan ... His name is aeden bennett , And sometimes ... I have trouble getting him out of my mind . Well , that must be frightening . I 'll be fine . I just need a minute . You need more than a minute . It takes time to get over something like that . And dan isn 't much help , is he ? - Dan 's been wonderful . - Oh , no , I know . He wants to help , and he says the right things , but ... Truth is , he 's not here , is he ? Just when you need him , he 's gone . And it 's never his fault . It 's always work , or it 'S ... Some damn thing that 's pulling him away . Yes . You worry ... That he 's going to leave some day and not come back , don 't you ? - I do . = Now , you listen to me , katie . You don 't need him . You don 'T . He 's my son , and I love him , but you 're strong . You are a strong woman , and you don 't need anybody except yourself . Now , come on . Come on downstairs . The music is so beautiful . You sure you don 't mind sticking around ? Yeah . I 'M ... Having a good time . It 's kind of a relief , actually . Um , I might have messed up . I told , like , a couple of dozen people in there . You what ? And katie wants to throw us a shower . Joke . Joking . - Three months , right ? - At least . Look . I - I know this wasn 't what you were planning on , But it 's going to be a good thing . I really believe that . I 'm starting to feel that way myself . Want to go back inside ? Sure . Jack ? Is there anything I need to know about dan ? Seriously ? No . Okay . Go back in ? - Yeah . - All right . Hey , hi . Hey , you made it . Yeah . Merry christmas , dan . Merry christmas . Hey . Nice trip ? Jack ... You remember the night dad left ? Yeah . What happened ? Do you really want me to tell you this again ? Christmas eve , dad came home , and he woke us both up , And he told us that he was leaving 'cause he felt like a freak . And kind of ruined christmas . That was better , right ? He told you that ? It was better than not hearing it . At least he tried . What , you really don 't remember this ? No . No . I guess I was too little . Merry christmas . How are you feeling ? Better . Your mom helped me , actually . - My mother ? - It 's a christmas miracle . Wow . Do you want to hear another one ? I just saved the newspaper . Really ? And I went to the past , and I learned something . What 's that ? That I 'm not my father . That I belong here . journeyman Season 1 Episode 11 Home by Another Way

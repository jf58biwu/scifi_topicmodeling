 My name is detective Brett Hopper , and this is the day that changes everything . Freeze ! Put your hands up ! You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder ... Who the hell are you people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I am living the same day ... over and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . Every day , I get another chance . For every decision , there 's a consequence . Every day , I get another clue . Hopper , you should have received a package today . It 's important . So far I 've got an hourglass with a fingerprint and a photo from an old crime scene . I 'm looking into a homicide from 1991 . - That 's when I first met your old man . - My father was there ? He was the lead detective on it . But he didn 't close it . Evidence went missing , and it just all fell apart . To find out more about this evidence , I have to get past Rita 's ex-husband Chad ... Why do I get the feeling you know more than you 're telling ? - Because I do . - And go to the one place that 's most dangerous to me ... Police headquarter . - Give me that . - No . - Stop playing . - What 's ... what 's a " nitzberg " ? A nitzberg , that 's a name I 'm using for this undercover thing . - Really ? - Yeah . You 're so not a nitzberg . - Well , that 's the point . - And who 's Sid ? - Sid , there 's a Sid on there ? - Here . " Take hourglass to Sid . " That 's S-I-D , silly , scientific investigations division . After I drop you off at work , I 'm going downtown . The hourglass is evidence , and I need to see if S.I.D. can pull a print on it for me . Sounds like a busy day . Yeah , it 's pretty crazy , but , for the first time in a while , I think I see some daylight . - Watch commander . - Yeah , this is Hopper . Any messages ? - Anybody looking for me ? - Hang on , let me check . All right . Na Hop , nothing but crickets on this end . All right , cool . I 'll call back later . Hopper . Hold up . I 'll be there in 15 . Hey , lieutenant . I know what 's going on . You do ? What time is your I.A. meeting with Shelton ? - At 3 : 00 . - All right . You hang tough , and don 't do anything stupid . A little late for that . Don 't touch the bobblehead . I need you to run a print on this hourglass . Here you go . You know the drill . Call you in about a week . - No . I need it today . - That 's gonna be a problem . I already got 20 guys who need it yesterday . Hey , here 's a thought . Why don 't you come back last week , and then I can have it ready for you this afternoon ? So are we doing this or not ? All right . Can you run this D.R. number for me instead ? Is it connected to this hourglass ? Yeah , that 's what I 'm trying to figure out . Come on , it 'll take two seconds . What 's the number ? - " 91-11 " ... - 91 ? As in 1991 ? Yeah . " 91-118394641 . " - That 's weird . - What ? You 're the second cop to open up this Jane Doe in a couple days . - Who 's the first ? - Some tool in I.A. , Chad Shelton . I need to talk to you . That 's why we have a 3 : 00 . Fix your watch . Come back then . Jane doe . 15-year-old homicide . Sounds fascinating . Talk to cold case . Yeah , well , I hear you 're looking into it . - Doesn 't ring a bell . - It 's a case my father worked on , an unsolved homicide . Your dad had a lot of those . Be more specific . D.R. Number 91-118394641 . - 4641 , huh ? - Yeah . Well , let me think . Is that the murder book ? Huh ? Is that the case ? Maybe . Hey , man , why are you messing with me ? 'Cause I don 't like you . Shelton . Yeah , yeah . I understand . For you . Detective Hopper , you 're under arrest for the murder of Alberto Garza . Why 'd you do it , man ? I 'm not saying a damn thing until you bring me Rita Shelton . It 's embarrassing , isn 't it , chained up ? I 've got to get to my brother ! I thought it 'd be different this time . Didn 't you ? You know what I 'm talking about . You and me are the same , salt and pepper , a couple of flies in the ointment . You don 't ... you don 't believe me ? I can prove it . Give me your arm . Quick , before they take one of us away . Just ... come on , hurry up . I told you , we taste the same ! We all taste just like chicken ! Look , it gets worse before it gets better . Just ask my brother . Okay , listen to me . Everything is gonna be all right . I 'm gonna get you out of this . I wouldn 't make any promises just yet , detective Hopper . You and your friend Ms. Shelton are here because you 're going to confess to the killing of Alberto Garza . Okay , okay , whatever you want . Okay ? Just ... just let Rita go . Well , it 's not that simple . Yes , it is . You got me . All right ? I confess . I killed Garza . You 're scared , rightfully so , but I don 't think you understand the importance of what I 'm asking . What are you talking about ? ! I ... I 'm cooperating , all right ? What else do you want from me ? The hourglass ? You want that ... that picture with the girl on it ? Is that it ? It seems I underestimated your awareness of the situation . I don 't know what they mean . You can have them . Take 'em . Just let her ... let ... let ... let her go . Tell me , do you believe in déjà vu ? What ... what did you say ? I 'm reminded of another time , another place ... and a different detective Hopper . What are you talking about ? What ... You see , a long time ago , I made an error in judgment . Now it 's come back to haunt me . You know what that error was , detective ? Compassion . People will promise anything to avoid pain . Get away from her . Hey . Hey , get away from her ! Get away from her ! Get away ... No ! Now remember ... there are other people you care about ... - Your sister ... - Please , no ! - her children ... - Okay , I 'll do whatever you want . I will do whatever you want . It 's an empty promise . - No ! - It needs to be clear . No , no . You need to understand just how serious I can be . No ! Rita , no ... No ! No ! No ! - Rita ! - No ! Rita ! It was hilarious . So the father stops for a second to put a new tape in his camcorder . He was one of those scary , overinvolved dudes who probably videotaped the moment of conception ... so he puts back the tape , and rushes into the delivery room ... and I 'm so boring you . No , no you 're not . Please keep talking . No , no , it 's okay . I know my nurse stories aren 't as exciting as , you know , " tell me where the bomb is . " You scared me . W hat ? I 'm just really glad you 're here . Who are you right now and what did you do with Brett Hopper ? Okay , so you offer to drive me to work . Now we 're sitting here having breakfast . Is there something you want to tell me ? Actually , there is . I 've been working on this new case , and it involves some pretty scary people , and I 'm afraid of what these people might be willing to do . So honey , promise me , all right ? If you ever , and I mean ever , find yourself in a position where you cannot get in contact with me , I need you to call Chad . He 'll keep you safe . What 's ... what 's that supposed to mean ? I know it sounds crazy ... but believe me ... Hey , man , don 't ever wake me up this early again no more , all right ? - All right , man , thanks . - All right . What the hell was that ? Just a present . Hey . Tomorrow night , behind the dugout . Gotta get me prints on this bad boy A.S.A.P. Done ... and done . Excuse me , lieutenant Graves ? I have some paperwork here for you to fill out . Sorry , not now . You 'll have to put it on my desk . Captain wants to see me . Something about Brett Hopper and this Alberto Garza murder . I see you . What ? There are menus ... Hey , where is it ? - Where 's what ? - The murder book . D.R. Number 91-118394641 . You have it . No , I don 't . You 're lying . I 'd be careful if I were you . I need the files in that book . What , did you sniff some glue this morning , Hopper ? Where did you put it ? All right , it 's not in your office . My office , you went through my office ? You went through my stuff ? I.A. has classified files . I can have you arrested for that . I 'm not leaving without it . Do this the hard way . I need that book ... now . Gun . Gun ! Way to go , genius . All right , guys , let 's hustle up . S.W.A.T. command at R.H.D. in five minutes . Let 's go . Hey , let 's go . Hopper 's always been a bit of a bull in a china shop . Any bad blood between the two of them ? You mean other than Hopper banging Shelton 's wife ? Ex-wife . Andrea , this is lieutenant Romero , S.W.A.T. Detective Battle . She 's Hopper 's current partner . Your Lt was just telling me about this Garza business . How much do you know ? Enough that I can tell something 's not right here . This isn 't Hopper . Your honest assessment , how tough is this gonna be ? Hopper 's stubborn , you know ? Sometimes that 's a good thing . Sometimes ... let 's just say I don 't envy Shelton . Stay close . I want you in the command post . Okay , Hopper 's here in the I.A. bullpen . There are exterior windows , but they don 't open . Everything 's locked tight . I 've got shooters down each of these hallways here , here , and here . There 's only one way out , and that 's through us . Okay , Hopper 's not dumb . He knows what 's coming . Then we won 't disappoint him . All we gon 'do is talk . I like to talk . Ask my last two wives . 99 out of 100 times , that 's all a person wants . And what about the one person who doesn 't ? I 've been doing this a long time . We don 't explore other options until my jaw falls off . Says here we 'll have eyes and ears on Hopper in a couple of minutes . I want to put my men in these halls . Nothing personal . Don 't want anybody getting nervous , going all cowboy on us . So has anyone tried to call Hopper yet ? Yes . He 's not answering his phone . Typical Hopper . You gonna pick it up , or what ? Hello . You know they 're just gonna keep letting it ring until somebody answers . I know the protocol . Get demands , kill the A.C. , - eyes and ears ... - What ? ! Hopper , it 's Graves . I 'm gonna hand you over to S.W.A.T. lieutenant Romero . He 's been doing this 20 years , so ... All right , put him on . Everybody okay in there , Hopper ? Yeah , well , Chad 's ego 's a bit bruised , but I think he 'll be just fine . - How about you ? You okay ? - I 've had better days . Look , I know you 're wanted for Garza 's murder , so I won 't sugarcoat this . I 've got 10 S.W.A.T. guys , about 40 cops , two snipers and one meat wagon out here , Hopper . Give me a reason to send the meat wagon home . Okay , send 'em home , then . We can forget this whole thing ever happened . Love to , but I can 't . But you have a lot of people out here who really love and care about you ... Who care about me , who wanna see me get through this alive . Whatever , man . Let 's just get to it . All right , now ... these are my demands . All right . I wanna see my girlfriend Rita Shelton and my sister Jennifer Mathis with her kids , brought here . - Anything else ? - No . That 's it . Bring them here so I can see them , and know that they 're safe . That 's it . Found the murder weapon in Hopper 's closet . Yeah , I heard . Hey , look , pretend you 're a cop for a second . Okay , but it 's a stretch . - Just pretend that you killed Garza . - I can do that . Now would you hide the murder weapon in your closet ? No . Would you stroll into a police station afterward and take a guy hostage ? I see what you 're getting at , but you 're forgetting something . - What 's that ? - People are stupid . This is a D-2 we 're talking about here , man . Other than us , how many people on the whole force knew that Hopper was being taken down ? - Maybe a half dozen . - Exactly . Hopper knows the drill , knows that word wouldn 't go wide until late this afternoon . Well , so he 's smart enough to know that , but stupid enough to pull a gun on a cop in a police station ? ' Cause that makes sense . Who 'd he take hostage , anyway ? Shelton in I.A. Really ? Looks like christmas came early this year . You know you 're wasting your time . S.W.A.T. ' s wiring the place . You 're never gonna find anything . Hey , sit down . At least put the cuffs in front . I 'm losing circulation here . What was all that crap about Rita and your sister , all you want 's the murder book , huh ? That 's between me and you . I don 't trust any of the cops in this place . Why were you looking into one of my father 's old cases ? I told you I don 't know what you 're talking about . I.A. pulls old files all the time . I can 't remember half the crap I sign off on . It 's standard procedure . Get it , or should I talk slower ? You want the book , why don 't you just ask for it ? Why use Rita as leverage ? - Hey , she 's not leverage . - The worst part is , she 's gonna come - running right in here to save you ... - Do I need to gag you ? You don 't deserve her . You never did . That ship sailed a long time ago , Chad . Let it go . Picture 's up . I know it 's hard to watch a friend do something this irrational . If Hopper pulled a gun on Chad Shelton , he did it for a rational reason . Gonna see how we 're doing on Rita and his sister . Ballistics are a match . The gun in Hopper 's closet - is the same one that killed Garza . - What about the prints ? The lab 's backed up . Roknowski has some rush job . Any chance we might get audio in my lifetime ? We got sound . ... bring her in . Hopper 's sister and her kids are en route , but there 's no word on Rita yet . If you really give a damn about Rita , you 'd keep her out of it . I 'm trying to protect her . - You 're bringing her into harm 's way . - Hey , sit down . - You want to see her hurt . Is that it ? - Get your ass back in that chair ! If you give up now , they 'll bring her in . - I can 't do that . - You would - if you really cared about her . - If I get caught , she gets killed . - Is that some kind of threat ? - No , there are people after me . - They 'll kill her . - What people ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know 'cause you 're a liar . - I 'm not lying . I 've seen it . - You 've seen Jack ... - I 've seen it happen ! - I 'm not listening to any more ... I 've seen Rita die ! I have seen Rita die three times . If I get caught , she gets killed . - What the hell are you talking about ? - I 'm living this day over and over . If I get caught , Rita will die ... again . Yeah . This is gonna end well . This is perfect . It 's just so you . Basically , the whole world , the very concept of time , revolves around Brett Hopper , 'cause you 're so special . Man , and people say I got an ego . I know how it sounds , but it 's the truth . So every morning at quarter past 6 , Rita , Andrea , all these people who 've died the previous day they 're all alive again ? Well , if there 's some cosmic reset button , why waste time with civility ? Why not just march on in here , machine guns blazing , perforate us all , take what you want ? Gee , I don 't know ... maybe because it 's wrong ? Why don 't you just give up now and start again tomorrow ? I can 't do that . - Why ? - Didn 't you just hear a word I said ? I 've seen Rita die three times . Imagine seeing her executed ... hearing the gunshot that takes her life ... hearing her screaming . Would you want to live through that over and over again ? I can 't un-see that ... and you know what the scariest thing is ? I don 't know when tomorrow 's gonna come . What if this day stops repeating ? I get caught , and she dies , and then tomorrow comes and she 's gone ... forever . Would you take that chance ? Thanks for coming in , Mrs. Mathis . We just want to ask you a few questions about your brother . Of course . Anything I can do . You know , I ... I knew your father back in the day . He was a good man . Thank you . It was a real shame what happened . Yeah , it took us all by surprise . So ... you 're close to your brother ? Very close . Great , and if he were going through a difficult time , - he 'd confide in you ? - You know , it 's hard to say . I mean , you get it the whole stoic cop thing . He 's very much like our dad that way . Nothing ever seems to faze them , and then ... you know , one day ... Has your brother ever expressed any ideas that you 'd describe as paranoid or conspiratorial ? - Conspiratorial ? - Yeah . No . What are you implying ? - We 're just trying to determine ... - no , you 're implying that Brett is doing all this because of a history of mental illness in our family . I 'd like to see my brother now . Yeah . I 've got somebody who wants to speak to you . Hi . Remember what we talked about . Hey , Brett . It 's me . Jen , are you okay ? - I 'm fine . - And the kids ? How are the kids ? - They 're safe . We 're all here . - Okay , okay . We all want what 's best for you , Brett . We want you and ... and Chad to get out safely . - Satisfied ? - Did you find Rita yet ? We 're still working on it . Look , Hopper , we had an agreement . I came through for you . Your sister is safe . - Now I showed good faith ... - I know where this is going . I 'll give you Chad when you bring me Rita Shelton . Let 's get another camera in there right now . Move ! Move ! What are you thinking ? I have concerns that Hopper has a different agenda than he 's been telling us . You think he 's saying good-bye . - I 've seen it enough times . - That 's ridiculous . He 's concerned about his girlfriend because we can 't find her . What if we do , we bring her in , - then what ? - What if we find her and she 's dead ? Thank you , detective . Let 's take the A.C. Out in there . I don 't want Hopper to get too comfortable . - You were shot ? - Yes . - When was this ? - Today . - I mean , like ... - How many " todays " ago ? I don 't know . I lost track . Your wounds carry over even though no one else 's do ? Yep , except for the bandages . I gotta patch this up every day . So you get shot , you can die . - I 'm guessing , yeah . - Good to know . While you 're over there cracking yourself up , you realize they still haven 't found Rita . For all I know , they already got her . They 'll find her . You hear that ? Yeah , they killed the air . I hate this part . Gotta say , even though you 're riding on the short bus , I applaud your attention to detail . Swapping the cell phone battery , the girl at the pool , the bus and margo , is it ? It 's good stuff . What comes after the bus thing ? I 'm serious . I want to know . I go to my mailbox and I get a package . And what 's in it ? Evidence ... something that might clear me . Hey , hi . - Hi . - hi . Who in the hell is calling him ? - Yeah . - Before you say one word to me , they still got ears on you in that room . For the record , you sound like a complete whack job . Yeah , well , I got more important things to worry about right now . Yeah , well , I wouldn 't be so sure . They 've got you on suicide watch . What ? Listen , there 's a suction mike on the window , west side of the room . Lift up the blind . You 'll see it . Oh , and you might also notice the half-dozen snipers waiting to ventilate your bughouse of a brain . Get in the chair . Hurry up , get in the chair . Where the hell is my picture ? - He 's losing it . - I need you to do something for me . - I need three guys . Move , move ! - Yes , sir . so ... let 's just say that you 're not completely nuts . Let 's ... posit the notion that you could be living the same day over and over . How is that possible , what with the laws of physics and all ? You 're not gonna start with that Discovery Channel stuff , are you ? You know , in these last few wonderful hours , my thoughts have alternated between why you 'd be trapped in the same day and the most painful way I could kill you when I get my hands free . I 'm thinking about this theory I read about in an actual book , Hopper , time as a texture . Sometimes it 's smooth , sometimes it 's soft ... but other times , it can be sticky . - Sticky ? - Yeah . Maybe you 're stuck . And here I thought you 'd blame it on all the tree huggers like you do everything else . Or maybe it 's more rooted in quantum physics . You ever read " Mobius transformations and the doppler shift , " or " spacetime mediation of quantum interactions " ? This is so you . - What ? - Just like back in the day , always showing off that education , like all these plaques you got up in your office . I 'm not showing off . You know , forget my theories . Maybe your mom just dropped you on your head too many times when you were a kid . At least I put some thought into it . Why do you think it 's happening ? You gotta have some theories . It 's irresponsible not to . I don 't know . At first I thought it was because I was injected with that ... that drug , but ... I 'm not talking physical , " how " it 's happening . I 'm talking the metaphysical " why " . Well , maybe it 's not about why . Maybe things just happen to people . Maybe you were chosen . No , I ... I definitely have not been chosen . Well , then how do you explain it , Buck Rogers ? In your gut , what does it feel like it is ? I feel like I 'm being punished . Punished ... for what ? Maybe you 're the victim of some government conspiracy , huh ? I hear they 've been doing some experiments ... - on stupid cops . - Sit down . - That would explain a lot . - Sit down . Sit down . - Initiate , now ! - Move , move , move ! Jackson , stand down ! - Get the hell back ! - Stand down ! You , get back . - What the hell was that ? - Is everyone okay ? Shut up , shut up ! I 'm only dealing with Andrea Battle . I should blow your head off . - You tried to kill me ! - I saved your ass . A thank you would be fine . You stop lying ! Stop lying ! That sniper was gonna put a bullet in your head , but I pushed you out of the way . Guy had a . 45 . Real bullets . Shoot to kill . That 's not protocol . They should have entered non-lethal ... flash-bangs and ... - bean bag rounds . - The second team did . Why 'd you do it ? To save your ass ? Well , you may be all psycho right now , but we were friends once , partners . I didn 't want to see you go out like that . Yeah , we were partners , but we weren 't , uh ... I mean ... we rode together every day for two years . Fine . Whatever way you wanna put it . By the way , you owe me $ 171 and 53 cents . What ? I bought coffee twice as much as you did . About time you paid your debts . You kept a tab ? I 'm thorough . It 's what makes me good at what I do . Here you go . The print was in the system . - Hopper . Isn 't that the ... - Thank you . Hopper will only talk to you . Come on . I 've got a solution . If everyone you care about is in trouble because of you , why don 't you take yourself out of the equation ? - What are you talking about ? - Kill yourself . Seems to me if you die , everyone else will be fine . - Oh , see , you 're not getting off that easy . - Pretty please ? I can 't , not if I can change the day . What about Rita ? You 're saying you could do something to change her situation ? Maybe . What about the guys that are after Rita ? - What do they want from you , anyway ? - They wanna me to confess to Garza 's murder . - So confess . - I did , but they said that I didn 't take them seriously . What could be more serious than taking a cop hostage in a police station to save the woman you love , huh ? Come on , man , what kind of cop are you ? All these days , you haven 't figured out one way to contact these guys ? You remember Baxter , right ? Yo , Hop . Been looking for you , man . Damien , I need to speak to Baxter . Baxter . Well , if I see that fed , I 'll pass word along . Well , that should be easy , ' cause I know he 's stuffed in the back of your truck . It 's for you . It 's Hopper . - Hopper ? - Baxter , listen good , because I only have time to tell you this once . Now you gotta follow my exact instructions , or Damien will kill you . Do you understand me ? - Yes . - All right , now I know about the guys who 've been squeezing you , in the blue Sedan . I need you to contact them for me and tell them I will give them whatever they want . Okay ? I will confess , but only if they let Rita go . All right , you got that ? Yes . You also gotta tell them now this is really important--listen- - I know how serious this is . I understand how serious this is . Repeat that back to me . You understand how serious this is . All right . Now , Baxter , if you screw me on this , you will die . I need to make a call . Detective Battle 's here . Thanks for coming , detective . Rita Shelton 's car was just found on Cahuenga Boulevard ... keys still in the ignition , she 's nowhere to be found . What do you need me to do ? - Yeah . - Hey , Hopper . - Heard you missed me . - Did you get it ? That thing you asked about ... matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez . He 's been in Pelican bay since ' 89 , serving five consecutive life sentences , so there 's no way he could 've killed anyone in ' 91 , let alone Garza . I thought they were connected . What about Rita ? He deserves to know the truth . No , it 's the only card we have . They found her car . She 's missing . That was irresponsible . You might 've just cost us two lives in there . Now get out . We 're ending this now . This is all your fault ! All you had to do was give me the murder book . You come storming on in here ... did you even think to look in cold case ... you know , where they keep the unsolved murder books ? You didn 't even look , did you ? No , I didn 't go down there , ' cause you told me it was in that damn filing cabinet right there . - I never said that . - Yes , you did . - When ? - Today . Yesterday . How the hell am I gonna get down there ? How am I gonna get the murder book ? Looks like your time is up . Yours , too . Don 't shoot ! - Don 't shoot . We 're coming out . - If I die , he dies . If I die , he dies . Did I ever tell you about our honeymoon ? Rita and I were on our way to Vegas . It was a saturday night . I had this big special dinner planned , and there was this dog ... thing got nailed on the 15 . It was this mangy stray . It was all bloody , on its last legs ... and meanwhile , I got bottles of Dom on ice , a 7-course feast , violins , the whole shot . Rita had to stop , had to try to save the thing , huh ? Hopper , where you going ? Took a while , but I finally convinced her we had to go . She was just so torn up over it . That 's when I knew ... that 's ... that 's when I knew I 'd made the right decision , that this was the woman for me . Hopper , you are leaving us no choice . A woman with that much heart ... you know , the only reason she 's with you is she pities you , Hopper . Is that right ? She 's a rescuer . She needs things she can save . That why she married you ? No , that 's why it didn 't work out . I don 't need saving . Never did . I was fine just the way I was . - Stop right there , Hopper . - I ain 't going nowhere . - I 'm just trying to get to cold case . - You promised to release chad if we brought your sister and Rita Shelton . Yeah , and you failed . Rita , did they hurt you ? Are you okay ? - I 'm all right . - Okay . - Okay . - We need to know that you are a man of your word . We need to know how serious you are . I don 't think you understand the seriousness of what I 'm asking . You see that ? You see that ? Yeah . Now we kept our part of the deal . I need you to keep yours . I confess . I confess to killing Alberto Garza . All right ? I did it . You hear me ? Okay . Okay . Okay . Hey , had . - Yeah ? - Just so you know , it was never loaded . Move , move , move ! Hey , don 't worry ... I 'll look out for her . Oh and if you 're right ... the book 's in the front seat of my car . Brett Hopper , you 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto garza . You have the right to remain silent . If you give up the right to remain silent , anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .

 Adelle ( over speaker ) : There are three flowers in a vase . The third flower is green . ( groans ) ( grunts ) ( sobbing ) Agent Paul Ballard was suspended of duty , pending an investigation into the shooting of Officer Harton . I know at the beginning of the weekend , we said no strings . Mm . Echo : We also said no ropes . Yeah , I remember . ( chuckling ) : I remember it all . I always will . Echo 's off task . Your little brain child just backfired . She 's a risk . An increasing risk . She had control of the situation . But we can 't control her . Our trouble ends here . I 'm going to make you an offer . I told you , all I want to be left alone . We both know we 're past that . Gee , what gave it away ? The big , black van ? Or the being held in this room for two days with no frickin idea where I am ? My offer is this . Your life ... for your life . I get five years , you get the rest . You 'll be free . Is that you talking ? Or the Rossum Corporation ? Why me ? Why did you pick me ? Caroline , you picked us . This is a good thing , Caroline . I know what I saw . What started this ? You and I have been doing this dance for almost two years . I thought you 'd have learned by now . ( sighing ) Nothing is what it appears to be . Please , any hack can do a regenerative study . Any hack with two years and a 50-million-dollar lab at their ... Fly , be free . Owen ? Fly . Owen ? Fly , be free . Owen , you okay , buddy ? Fly , fly ! Owen ? Fly , fly ! Hey , Owen , it 's us . Fly , fly ! Fly ! Owen ? ! Owen , it 's okay . Fly ! Fly ! Owen ? Gravity 's not the equation . Owen ? ! Owen ? ! Hey , stop ! Owen , stop ! Ingrid : Oh , my god ! ( banging at glass ) ( Ingrid laughing ) ( laughing harder ) ( laughing uncontrollably ) ( glass shattering ) Ambrose : That is one of only two existing vials of our most promising new memory drug . The other vial is missing . I don 't need just one active on this . I need an army . I 've already rearranged the schedule . The boots are as good as on the ground . If this is about Foxtrot speaking Mandarin instead of Cantonese , It was a very ... Topher . Simple ... This is ... Clive Ambrose . Co-chairman of the , uh , Rossum Corporation , third richest man in the country , nominated for a Nobel prize . ( chuckles nervously ) I might throw up . That 's a compliment . Something really bad happened . There 's been an incident at Freemont College . Owen Johnson . He was a grad student at one of our premiere labs . But not anymore . Owen ingested a psychotropic modification of aphenethylamine compound . One of the memory drugs Rossum 's got in RD ? N-7316 . It breaks down natural inhibitions in the hippocampus in order to awaken sleeping parts of the brain . We 're still in the experimental stage . Phase one of N-7316 manifests like a recreational narcotic . Giddiness , light hallucinations . Munchies . ( chuckles ) Phase two apparently manifests as a complete loss of impulse control . Could be phases , could be ... a little thing I 'd like to call body chemistry . We 're all our own little cesspools of hormones , enzymes , chemical reactions . It 's the same as any drug- - Heroin , cocaine , caffeine , how your body reacts depends on a multitude of indefinable factors . You snort horse once , don 't like it , you go back to your organic tea , have a nice life . I do it once , whoo , I 'm doing two bags a day for 20 years . One toot for you , adios , amigo . That 's what 's so exciting About drugs ! Not that I 'd know . We do biweekly drug tests . Just pure scientific observations . How did the drug find its way into the general campus population ? We don 't know . Maybe Owen was selling it . Maybe he or someone else put it in the soda machine in the dining hall . One vial is enough to take out the entire student body . No antidote floating around , I 'm guessing . Right now the best we can do is sedation . We 're hoping you can help us do better . While you work on an antidote , a team of actives will secure the campus and try to locate the missing vial . Oh , right . They 'd be immune . How did you know that ? All right , this baby attacks the inhibitors in the hippocampus to break down the repressed memory blocks , right ? Actives don 't have them . Stuff would bounce right off them . Think you can help us , Mr. Brink ? Well , I can 't hurt . ( laughs ) Prob-probably . ( clears throat ) Start with the imprints and get the actives in the field . If you need any extra help ... Cool . Echo 's on an engagement , right ? Yeah , old client , new fantasy . I should call her back in ? No , she can sit this one out . So , what do you think ? Wow , I 've never seen anything like it . It looks like a dragon . Is that stupid ? Uh , here . Oh , no , thank you . Alice , you 're going to drive this bike . I am ? Yeah . You 're gonna do a lot of new things today . Okay ! Wow . Are you making breakfast ? It 's kind of late , but since I 'm a gentleman of leisure , and you 've taken up professional sleeping . Mmm ... Didn 't know I could cook , did you ? Nope . Good . Then you won 't be disappointed when you find out I can 't . Paul , listen . Take those off 'cause they 're done . And listen . I 'm a grown-up person . We got ... impulsive and five minutes later , someone nearly killed me in your apartment . I know you feel an obligation ... That is not what ... Hey ! I don 't think you don 't like me . But we don 't fast-forward to the honeymoon just because I had a bad day . I like taking care of you . I 'm glad . I think you 're dreamy . But in my dream , I 'm stronger than you know . I think you proved that when you ... That was luck . I 'm not a prize fighter . That Russian thug had two left feet . I wish he had . It would have been a lot easier to I.D. a guy with two left feet . They did I.D. him . They got a name which I guarantee you wasn 't his . I took a set of prints myself , though . Got a friend who can access a few databases outside of the Bureau 's reach . The Dollhouse found this guy somewhere . Professional killers are made . They 're trained . I 'm sorry . You don 't want to talk about this . You 're off the case . Officially . They suspended you ! So far as the Dollhouse is concerned , I 'm not a threat anymore . This is the perfect time ... You can 't drop it . You said you thought this was important . And they tried to kill me ! Mellie , I promise you ... You can 't promise ! It 's blind luck that I 'm not dead already . What you can do is drop the case . Let someone else handle it . Yeah , you love taking care of me . I think you know your way across the hall . Let 's go . You guys are up there . Alright guys . Everybody knows where they 're going ? Victor : All right , let 's go there . Energy . We 're going to do the grid . Six guys and girls , women- - Searching this campus top to bottom . I want that other vial . Tom , this is Dr. Gawa from the center for disease control . Super . I haven 't heard a good flesh-eating-strain-of-something horrible story in a while . Yeah , I 've got dozens . Hopefully today won 't be worth talking about . Let 's find these kids and get them better . I 've got you set up at the Kappa Zeta Chi house . And , Tom , you 'll be running the grid . Uh , the grid 's taken care of . I 'll be too busy rounding up our day-trippers to look under mattresses . That 's my call . Actually , it 's mine . You 're NSA ? Which outranks Rossum private security by more than a whole bunch . Topher . All right , fine , I 'll stay here and be the communications command post . First have someone show Dr. Gawa to Kappa house . You good ? Yeah . I 've always wanted to go to a frat party . Echo : Are you sure you 're okay ? I 'm okay , If you 're okay . I 'm great ! Is that terrible ? No , it 's wonderful . I 'm not sure how to work this , but ... Okay . Oh , God , what if somebody sees it ? Only us . Okay , my life on it . I never thought I 'd ... Oh , I 've lost picture . Sorry . No just , uh ... On the side . There 's a button . Oh . T.V. reporter : The tragic suicide appears to be a case of the stressed-out student who didn 't know how to ask for help . Freemont College officials said that counseling will be available on campus throughout the week . I have to go . I have to help him . Alice , is-is everything all right ? I 'm terribly sorry . I have to go . Yeah , very funny . I have to get him out of there . Okay , it 's ... It 's not actually that funny ! Alice ? ( door shuts ) That was a door . Caroline : You know what I want to do tonight ? Let 's drive to that thing up north . ( laughs ) You know , we don 't have to go to every antiwar demonstration in the state . Yes , we do . I love you . ( beeping and trilling ) Are you comfortable ? Yes , thank you . I 'm going to give you a shot . And then I just need you to sit still for a while . Can you do that ? If you like . Just think about pretty things . Rainbows . She 's immune , but dosing her will help me find an antidote . ( beeping ) ( sighs ) ( sputters through lips ) All righty . Let 's see exactly what this stuff is doing so we can undo it . This may take a while . Be patient . What shall I do , think about rainbows ? Go for it . Or shall I think about how that glorified dog 's body , Clive Ambrose , can 't keep his affairs in order ? ( computer trilling ) Oh . You could have said no . The Rossum Corporation is why we exist . And I believe in the work we 're funding . I also believe that the only reason I don 't have Clive Ambrose 's job is ' cause he couldn 't handle mine . Oh . So , now we 're sharing . Aha . Can you just figure out a way to keep people from killing themselves on this drug ? We have more than a few in the early stages , and sedating them is hardly a cure . It 'll buy me time . As long as we keep the place locked down and don 't have any more x factors , then here I come to save the day . ( laughs ) Yeah . ( sighs and sputters through lips ) Can you get me a juice box ? Are you lost ? Hi . Um ... No . Do you go to Freemont ? Um ... I don 't know . Th-there 's parts that seem ... I-I ... I don 't know . You can come with us . We got one more . Where are we going ? No , I don 't know anything is wrong . Maybe that 's the client 's new fantasy . Send a doll to college . Well , which college ? Uh , Freemont . I tracked Echo here . Oh , please God , be joking . Why ? What 's up ? Phew ! Your brain rocks ! Adelle : We have a major engagement happening there . Echo cannot interfere with it . Get her out of there quickly . And if you need assistance , call Dominic . Do you understand ? Hold on . Yes ? There are mansions in your eyes . Did you know that ? ( gasps ) You can see the doors ... Excuse me . No , I definitely don 't understand . Echo : I don 't think I 'm supposed to be here . Sit down . I 'm just going to give you a little shot . Sit down . The television made me . I had to come here . A shot of what exactly ? You ingested a powerful narcotic . I need to make sure you don 't hurt yourself . Oh , Matt and I don 't do drugs . I have somewhere to be , not here . Just relax . Leo : What do they need babies for ? Rossum . ( gasps ) no ! I don 't think she wants the shot . Look , I 'm not on drugs ! ( screaming ) The window glass . It 's coming for us . Sierra : Fine . I 'll get you the liquid gel . You , too . Don 't worry . It wears off . I mean , I 'm starting to feel normal again . Sort of . The walls stopped moving . I 'm not supposed to be here . I have to save him . Who ? I love you . I don 't know . Him . I have to get into Rossum . The Rossum lab ? This about Owen ? What do you know about Rossum ? Just that I have to get into the building . You know , I think they did this . Put something in the water , using us as guinea pigs . Guinea pigs ? Well , yeah , I mean , I 'm guessing that we 're all nice , neat entries in someone 's lab journal . You know , uh , this many affected , this many hurt ... Gone . They killed my friend . I have to get to the lab . Good luck . I mean , it 's surrounded by security guards . No , I can get in . I just have to listen to myself . You 're serious ? Yeah . I know a way in , I ... I think . Which kind of freaks me out . Okay , well , I 'll help you . I mean , I know that lab like the back of my hand . Oh , no . You don 't have to do that . Well , I 'm not gonna let you go in there by yourself . Anyway , it 's not just for you . I mean , I want to find evidence , prove they did this , and get their asses sent to jail . I 'm Sam . I think I 'm glad I met you . Alice . We got to get out of here . Woman ( crying ) : Stuff ! It 's all too big ! No ! ( woman crying ) ( man grunting with exertion ) We got to get out of here . Yeah . Wow . That worked . Thank you . Let 's get out of sight , okay ? Come on . Yeah . Would you like to have a treatment ? No . Hey . Wow . Did not maintain control of that situation . ( laughing ) Caroline : I don 't want to say evil ? Yeah . Yeah , you really do . Oh , the Rossum Corporation is evil . " Minds matter . " ugh ! This guy gives me the heebie-jeebies . Clive Ambrose , the face of Rossum . Marketing campaign that big- - he 's hiding something . Leo : That whole company 's hiding something . Yeah , for instance , animal testing . I mean , monkeys , puppies . They 're torturing them . Kicking it Mengele-style , all in the name of science . Monkeys should not be guinea pigs . Guinea pigs should not be guinea pigs . Whatever they say in those ads , the ends don 't justify the means . I have a plan . I have the beginnings of a plan . Is this when you free all the monkeys , and they go nuts and bite you to death ? No . This is where we film the monkeys in their cages and put the footage online . Yeah , where millions can view it over and over again . Mm . They 'll be shamed into policy changes . And we get in ... How ? I mean , Rossum 's got to have security . I 'm working on that part . This is not how we used to party . I spent four years partying in the shadow of that building . Do you know what they could have done in there in four years ? How many living creatures they ... Ugh ! Someone has to stand up . It doesn 't have to be you guys . I-I wouldn 't ask it . This is just where I am . Yup . That 's my girl . That 's my Caroline . Mmm . Victor : These . I think none of these are tagged . None of this is tagged . Get on all of this . James ? Nothing yet , sir . Well , I don 't have to tell you to keep looking , but ... Both : Keep looking . Sure . Now you 're experts . Four hours ago , you were discussing your love for apple sauce . Well , my guys have got this fairly well-contained . 14 subjects exhibiting erratic behavior , sedated . ( sighs ) What ? We rounded up 14 ... You okay ? I 'm fine . Go on . Four ... ( laughing ) : 14 round what ? Buddy ? Hmm ? How about we head over to containment ? I 'm fine . Dr. Gawa will give you a light sedative ... Hey , I 'm fine . All right . Easy , buddy . I know how to solve problems . You bet . Oh , man , this is so heavy . It makes my arms tired . Want me to help you out with that ? ( sighs ) Thank you . Okay , here we go . ( sighs ) Hey , wow . It 's ... It 's so heavy . Right . Okay . Extremely . Everything 's heavy . Yeah , I need to speak to the person in charge at the security office . I see . Please , do keep me updated . And please take care of him . Thank you , Agent . This is unbelievable . What part was believable before ? The drug . It 's not being sold , Topher . The effects are spreading . Mr. Dominic is exhibiting erratic behavior . ( nervous laugh ) He didn 't take any . There 's no way Dom would consciously try and have fun . It could be airborne . We 'd be seeing a lot more cases on the campus . Beyond even . Exposure to a patient , whether viral , or through touch ... that spreads more slowly , but pretty soon , that campus is gonna fill up with wacky time bombs . Well , we need to know what it is . Yes , well , we will ... When I figure it out . And reversing the effect ? You making any progress ? I 'm working ! What are you doing besides being ... Being what ? Wait a minute . Sarcastic ? Unfeeling ? ( sighs ) British ? It 's an animal . Where ? No ! The word ! Still , you have to admit , I am ... very ... British . I don 't say hard R 's . You know what I like ? Brown sauce . What 's it made of ? Science doesn 't know . It 's made of brown . Brown ... mined from the earth by the hardscrabble brown miners of North Brownderton . Oh , my God ! I find lentils completely incomprehensible . What the sun-dappled hell is Echo doing at Freemont ? That 's got nothing to do with the drug . Which means , our problems are huge and indomitable . Ooh . I could eat that word . ( sputters through lips ) Or a crisp . Do you have any crisps ? You haven 't seen my drawer of inappropriate starches ? Come on . Ah . Oh , my God , I 'm having such a terrible day . Well , sorry it 's not much , but the , uh , scholarship doesn 't cover a decorating fee . It 's nice . So , you used to go to school here ? No . I went back east . I think . I mean , I did . I went to Colby . Okay . So , someone you know went here . A boyfriend ? I don 't know . I mean , I woke up this morning , and everything was normal . And then , I met Matt , and ... we did stuff . And then , I saw the Rossum building on T.V. , and I had to leave , and ... and I-I can 't really deal with a lot of questions right now . Yeah . It 's been a , um ... weird , bad day . Say no more . Okay , so ... We are here , and ... Rossum building is here . The lab is on the second floor . That 's where I save him . Well , Alice , I don 't want you to expect too much . There may not be a " him " . There might not be the proof against Rossum you 're looking for , either , but that 's not stopping you . Nothing stops me- - my mother 's voice is too loud in my ear . Ah ... Mama 's boy . I ain 't got no choice . I 'm all she 's got . So , you remember how to get in this building ? Underneath . That 's the way in . Okay , you 're not overwhelming me with specificity . Lily Foundry . We have to find Lily Foundry . Listen to me carefully . I 've got a huge phalanx of machines that go ping , and this is carried by anyone exposed to it . Through touch . It is mandated That you get any Rossum operatives off the grounds and send them back here . Say hi for me . Nope , you dolls , you 're ... By which , of course , I mean NSA , CDC folks ... You 're safe as houses . Because of the government . They do things . But anyone else who comes in contact with the drug is susceptible . Am I sure ? I am fairly sure . ( grunting ) Secret Agent Victor is so lofty . I have a good story about him . Hold on . I have a ... I have another call . I have another call . I have a better call . Boyd ! Did you find Echo ? What ... Boyd . Did you find Echo ? It 's all right , Ms. Dewitt . I 've , I 've worked it out . Worked out what ? Is Echo contained ? Just listen . ( playing classical music ) ( classical music playing over speakerphone ) It 's around here somewhere . You mean she 's around here . I don 't think it 's a person . I think Lily foundry is an it . So , we 're looking for an it ? Uh-huh . Caroline . Caroline Farrell ! Excuse me ? I knew that was you . That 's not me . I 'm sorry . Professor Janak . We charted the whole history of the Americas together . Her name is Alice , but have a good day . I don 't know this person , do I ? I know , she 's ... She 's tweaked . She needs to be sedated . ( laughing ) We make choices . I 'm well aware that there are forces beyond our control , but even in the face of those forces , we make choices . And then we live with them . And then we die with them . ( crunching ) I know why Echo went to Freemont . To punish you ? To let Caroline punish me . ( sighs ) November : Are you ever gonna Shut up about her ? ( scoffs ) ( crying ) : Is she what you think about when you 're on me ? Would you let me die , Paul ? Would you be relieved ? ( sobbing ) You said it didn 't affect them . Topher : She 's not tripping . She 's glitching . She 's remembering . Adelle ( over speaker ) : There are three flowers in a vase . The third flower is green . " there are three flowers in a vase . " Then my odyssey takes me To the city clerk 's office , where , it turns out , the counter jockeys aren 't opposed to a little " you scratch my back with a wad of cash , and I scratch yours with sealed planning records . " And voila . Blueprints . I 'm riveted . You are a snide bitch . I know- - I love that about me . Me , too . Well , these look like ... Really boring building plans . Yeah . I thought so too , the first two hours I stared at them , but then I saw ... Oh . Nice work , babe . Yeah , I 'm totally in the dark here . Well , they put in these utility tunnels here . Leo : Yeah , but according to these plans , the room they lead to is empty . So , if you wanted to , say , move things in and out of the lab without opening the front door ... Echo : You 'd go in here . Babe ... This is good news . Where 's your happy face ? Rossum is seriously powerful , and this just ... this just became real . Well , it 's always been real to me . Caroline , I 'm just saying you might not want to piss them off . Rossum is exploiting animals in the name of " science , " and God knows what else . I might want to piss them off a real lot . Okay , okay . Go easy . I 'm not backing out . You 'd better not back out . I 'm with you . Damn right . Always . The entrance is here somewhere . Okay , we 're nowhere near the Rossum building , and I checked all the directories for all these buildings , and still no Lily Foundry . Because you 're standing on her . There . We ... We follow the red pipe . I 've been here before , but how can you not remember something and remember it at the same time ? That 's just the drug making you act weird . No . I felt it before . It pulled me here . Well , maybe you 're crazy . Do you think so ? What I do think is , when we get in there , we have to look for lab books , uh , logs , chemical samples , proof that Rossum is responsible for this mess . Right there . That goes straight into the Rossum building . Yeah . Okay , we 're gonna have to move like ninjas from here on out . We 're not gonna have to fight , are we ? Because I don 't even really know how to make a fist . Not if we do this right . Okay , so the staircase to the lab is just beyond the lobby . Now , timing is everything . Just pretend like we 're playing a video game , and I 'm gonna go first . And when he turns his back , then you go . I don 't play video games . You . I am so sorry that I tried to kill you . It 's okay . No , it 's not okay . I tried to burn you to death . Who does that ? What 's the holdup ? He says he tried to kill me . He 's been exposed . Oh . Um ... It 's okay . Really , uh , whatever you think you did , I 'm over it . You know , uh ... Water ... Bridge ... Under . Please , I 'm begging you , don 't walk away . I just ... I need your forgiveness . You got it . You don 't mean it . You still hate me . I could see it in your eyes , right , and you just keep looking at me with them . I mean it . I forgive you . Look , the guns , right , the running around , the barking orders . This is not all there is to Lawrence Dominic . No , ma 'am , this is just my job . I 'm not just hard edges . I mean , look at me . Check this suit out . I 'm not just hard edges . How many times have I told you ? He 's not a nice doggie . I don 't want to pet him . Sierra : Mr. Dominic ? Mr. Dominic . I , uh , hear you 're feeling a little under the weather . I think I might have something that might help . He 's not a nice doggie . I don 't want to pet him . He 'll attack me . ( gun firing ) ( sighs ) All right . Everybody with a firearm , turn it in , now . Right here ! Let 's get our friend sedated . ( gasps ) ( gasping ) You remember to be very quiet during the game , right ? Noise is upsetting . Lift up your dress . ( gasping ) Stay away from me . No , it 's okay , it 's okay . ( woman screaming ) I 'm not gonna hurt you . We got to move now . Let 's go ... Please . ( sobbing ) : It 's not ... A fun game . Please , stop . Victor : We got to move now . Please , wait . Listen , wait ! ( explosion ) Soft . Like a kitty . Mm ... ( clicks tongue ) I don 't hear anything . She didn 't finish the trigger code . She 's probably right as rain . Go check . I am your superior ! In every way . Go check . He dumped the stock . He ran out of options . Help me get her into the chair . I can 't deal . Help me get her into the chair . You need to wipe this out of her . It doesn 't make any sense . Then you make it make sense . ( grunting ) You think I float around like a balloon , untethered to your muck ? Flip . ( straining ) : I run this house . No , no . It doesn 't make any sense . Except ... Actives ' brains aren 't like ours . I mean , we alter them this way and that , so ... N seven three ... Blah , blah , blah ... It hit the actives later , all right ? And differently . Like ... A memory glitch . Which means ... The compound is breaking down into a protease and zipping right through our man-made memory blocks . November glitched to a traumatic memory . I bet the same thing is happening to the other dolls . Upside is the drug 's devolving . A couple hours , it will be gone . How do you explain the man who lost his brain down his shirt ? Had an extreme dose . Way more than you can absorb . Way more than ... ( sighs ) ... he would have taken . It 's a murder . It 's different . Yeah ? What did it used to be like ? I don 't know . Right where I left it . I have to stop him . Who ? Something awful . Is that the drug ? You found it . You found it really fast . Sam ? What are you ... Oh ... ( muffled screaming ) I 'm sorry . Look , I 'm-I 'm really sorry . ( muffled whimpering ) I 'm sorry . Leo : We 're in . Caroline : Leo , over here . What do they need babies for ? This is Rossum . They don 't care about souls . Human or animal . ( dog barks ) What are they doing to you ? ( cages rattling ) Caroline : Are you getting this ? Babe ? You got to see something . ( sighs ) what is it ? Science fiction ? They 're not just experimenting with animals . Babe , we got to get footage of ... Are they ... ? What the hell are they doing ? Something really not good . I told you Rossum was evil . Here . Take this . You get the animals . - Let me see what I can find out here . - Yeah . Look at her . Do we have to just leave her here ? Babe , it 's not a pet shop . We can 't take them with us . ( lock rattling ) Hey ! Don 't move ! Go ! Run ! Caroline : What ... Did you do ? Make it stop . Please . I 'm sorry about this , okay ? I-I didn 't want to do this , any of this . All these people- - why did you hurt them ? This right here is my chance for something . Owen and me were gonna take this over to Bel Med Tec . In Switzerland ? It 's the number two drug company in the world right after Rossum . You know what they 'd pay for this ? Billions . You 're insane . Nobody 's perfect . You do love a fight . So we 're going ? ( panting ) You 're a killer . ( sighs ) Listen , Owen was my best friend . And him dying- - I didn 't want that . I just wanted to get him out of the way long enough for me to get out of town . I didn 't know he 'd hurt himself like that , okay ? He knew what you were going to do . It was his idea . And then he got scared , said Rossum would come after us . He tried to stop me . Just because you didn 't mean it doesn 't mean you didn 't kill him . You 're responsible . You think about it your way , and I 'll think about it mine . Enjoy your trip . No . ( panting ) ( panting ) Here ... Leave it ! Leave it ! Leo : No ! Leave it ! Go ! ( gunshots ) No ! ( panting ) You 're a killer , Sam . You killed him ! ( panting ) ( whispers ) : I love you , and you 're gonna be okay . - Oh , my god . Come on , we have to get out of here . - Shh ! Okay , okay . Leo , come on ... ( grunts ) Oh , hey , again , so sorry about the burning alive thing . Ooh ! Ooh ! Stay with me . I need you ! Leo , please ! ( choking ) ( crying ) : I 'm your girl . ( slapping him ) Leo . Please , Leo ! Leo , stay ! Please stay ! Get off of me , you crazy bitch ! ( grunts ) ( panting ) ( gasping ) Echo ? Mm ? ( panting ) Would you like a treatment ? ( panting ) Yes . ( whimpers ) ( panting ) Man : Ms. Dewitt , I 'm glad you could come . Adelle : You seemed quite confident she fits the profile . Yes . She 's been through a lot . Well , you were right to call . She was just here . She won 't get far . Mr. Dominic , please come in . Thank you . Would you like a drink ? No , thank you . Yeah . All the actives have been evaluated and processed . Everything seems satisfactory . Wonderful news . Yours , I believe . Yes . Uh , thank you . The , uh , press is running with the story we sold them . " student drugs classmates before committing suicide . " And Echo ? I suppose you 'll be recommending she be sent to the attic . That 's entirely your call , ma 'am . For God 's sakes , quit calling me ma 'am . We got drugged . We behaved like idiot children . It happens . It 's over . You may go . ( sighs ) ( sighs ) Were you gonna say anything ? I just need to get away . It 's not forever . I get it . I 'm sorry . Debbie might crash here sometimes , if you hear a noise . If you need to reach me ... You know what ? Maybe it 's better if I don 't know where you are . In case . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Mellie ? You know where I am . This should help you relax . Well , I don 't want to relax . I want the hell out of here . I understand . You can 't hold me . You have to have cause , evidence . I 'm not with the government . Well , then who the hell are you ? I 'm someone who can give you what you want . And what do I want ? A new life . A better life . Your mother , Antoinette Jennings of 483 Hellena Street . I understand she 's experiencing some financial difficulties . In fact , she 's about to lose her home . Do not threaten my mother . Quite the opposite . Once you sign these papers , your mother will begin receiving a monthly stipend large enough to solve her financial problems . It will continue for five years , and at the end of that time , you will be quite capable of supporting her all on your own . How ? I 'm going to make you an offer . . : Napisy24 - Nowy Wymiar Napisów : . Napisy24.pl

 Yeah , everything is under control at the moment . SOCO are on scene , over . Probably three , over . - Oh , sweetheart . - Gwen , I 've got enough . It 's an order . Well , I 've only just arrived , so tough . What do I do now ? - Who is it ? - Dunno . Some bloke . - You going to Slimbo 's on Friday ? - What is it , drinks ? - Bit of pizza , I think . - Might do , yeah . Aye , aye . What 's happening there , then ? Yeah , SOCO are leaving the scene . Over . - On you go . - Come on , now . Come on . Move back if you could . Thank you . - Okay , now go . Back up . Back up . - Hey , what 's going on ? Excuse me , sir . What is it ? What 's happening ? Buggered if I know . It 's orders from above . But the body 's still in there , though , isn 't it ? - We can 't just leave it . - Move back , they said . Clear the site . - Special access , they said . - For whom ? Torchwood . - Who 's Torchwood ? - Special ops or something . - Is that hot ? - Yeah . Have it . But they 're not allowed in there . They could contaminate the evidence and all sorts . - How can they ... - Don 't ask me . There 's no procedure any more . It 's a fucking disgrace . There you go . I can taste it . Oestrogen . Definitely oestrogen . You take the pill , flush it away , it enters the water cycle , feminises the fish . It goes all the way up into the sky and then falls all the way back down onto me . Contraceptives in the rain . I love this planet . Still , at least I won 't get pregnant . Never doing that again . How 's it going ? Nothing yet . It 's got to connect . I 've just got to feel it . Then hurry up and feel it . Freezing my arse off here . I can 't just flick a switch . It 's more like access . - It grants me access . - Whatever that means . It 's like ... Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Position . If I get punched again , I 'm punching it right back . Just concentrate . Suzie . I was ... I was ... I was ... - Oh , my God . I was going home . - Listen to me . We 've only got two minutes so it 's important that you listen , okay ? - Who are you ? - Trust me . You 're dead . - How am I dead ? - You were stabbed . - But I 'm not dead , I can see you . - We 've brought you back , but we haven 't got long . I 'm sorry , but you 've got to concentrate . - Who did this to you ? What did you see ? - Why am I dead ? - Who attacked you ? - I don 't wanna be dead . Sixty seconds . You 've got to think . Just focus on me . - What was the last thing you saw ? - I didn 't see any ... - I don 't know . - Who killed you ? Did you see them ? I don 't know . There was something behind me . Police said one stab wound in the back . - So you didn 't see anything ? - No . - What happens now ? - Thirty seconds . - But he didn 't see anyone . - Don 't waste it . What else do I say ? - What 's your name ? - John . John Tucker . - Okay , John . Not long now . - Who are you ? Captain Jack Harkness . Tell me , what was it like when you died ? What did you see ? John , tell me what you saw . Ten seconds . Nothing . I saw nothing . Oh , my God . There 's nothing . Shit . I said it was stupid telling him he was dead . - Well , you try it . - Trust me ! Like that 's gonna work . Told the last corpse he was injured . He wasted the whole two minutes screaming for an ambulance . Maybe there 's no right way of doing it . What do you think ? MAN ONTV : Ah , your girlfriend , is it ? - You still up ? - In here . They said on the news , murder in the city centre . Were you there ? No . I don 't know . Nothing to do with me . - How come you 're still up , though ? - Banana Boat came round . He was saying he 's got plans . He 's off again next summer . - How come you 're not pissed , then ? - Oh , we had a cup of tea . He 's read this thing about diabetes . Me and him having tea . That 's middle age , that is . - Some Chinese in the fridge . - No , I 'm knackered . - You coming to bed ? - I 'll just finish here . This man 's found his sister . I 'll see you in a minute . Yvonne , can you do me a favour ? Can you do a search for me ? Join the queue . It 's a Captain Jack Harkness . Can you check him out ? I 'm busy . There 's proper channels , Gwen . What sort of captain ? - Don 't know . Just captain . - If I 've got time . - Thanks ! - Okay ! Sarah Pallister , 72 . Murdered in her front room . Rani Ghosh , 45 . Murdered in Robin Tree Alley . And now John Tucker , 19 , murdered in Llangafelli Lane . So far , there 's absolutely nothing linking these three victims apart from the way they died . As far as we can tell , all with the same weapon . A blade approximately eight inches long , three inches deep . The two women were stabbed from the front , but John Tucker was stabbed from behind . - What does that tell us about the killer ? - That he 's a coward . Those people last night , the people in the car , who were they ? - What 's Torchwood ? - Don 't know . - Special ops ? - Yeah , but what does that mean ? I 'll bet you 10 quid they 're DNA specialists . It 's all DNA these days , like that CSI bollocks . Cardiff . I 'd like to see that . They 'd be measuring the velocity of a kebab . Thank you very much , break it up ! Police . Break it up , thank you . Ow ! Excuse me . Sorry . It 's all sealed off up there . Who did that ? - I thought it was you lot . - But what 's it for ? What 's happened ? I don 't know . 9 : 00 this morning it was all sealed off . They never said . Chemicals or something . Hello . Sorry , I 'm just looking for someone . Yeah , right . Clever . Anyway , I don 't know if you saw a man come through here ? A tall man ? In one of those big sort of military coats . Okay . If you could answer , this is official business . You all right ? That 's good . That 's a good mask sort of thing . Look , I 'm sorry if I 'm interrupting something , but I think we can stop this now , okay ? It 's all very well playing silly buggers , but I 'm busy , all right ? Now , I 'm looking for a man in a big grey coat . I said , we can stop being silly . Ma 'am ! There you are . I did ask . I saw Dr Maheeb 'cause I thought it was him who said about the police , but he said no . Then I said about the chemicals and he said , " Don 't be so stupid . What chemicals ? " So I don 't know . Could be anything . Who 've you got with you there , then ? So much for sealing it off . Oh , there 's a face . N ice one . Hey , I tell you , mate . You should try plastic surgery . Not on the N HS , mind . - You all right ? - Yeah . Bloody hell . That is brilliant . That 's like , um , Hellraiser . That 's first class , that is . Look at that . That ... It 's just like real teeth . Honest . Go ! Go ! Go ! - Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! - Okay . Get it down ! On the floor ! Oi . Registration Charlie , Foxtrot , 06 , Foxtrot , Delta , Uniform . OFFICER ON RADIO : Charlie , Foxtrot , 06 , Foxtrot , Delta , Uniform . Hold on . I think Yvonne wants a word . - No sign of a Captain Jack Harkness . - Did you search outside Cardiff ? No , that never even occurred to me . Course I did . I went nationwide . There 's about 15 Jacks and Johns with that surname . None of them 's a captain . Suppose he could have made it up . The only Captain Jack Harkness on record is American . - That 's it ! He 's American . - Had you forgot to tell me ? - So who is he ? - American volunteer . Royal Air Force , 133 Squadron . Except he disappeared . Vanished off the records , presumed dead . - When was that ? - 1941 at the height of the blitz . On the morning of January the 2 1 st , 1941 , Captain Jack Harkness failed to report for duty . Never seen again until now . What 's going on , Gwen ? You seeing ghosts ? - You lot ! Oi ! Torchwood ! - Oi ! - You can 't leave that there . - Police . I can see that , love , and you 're still not leaving it there . I 'm talking to you . Excuse me ! Move your bloody car . Did you get anything on that registration ? No such number . - What does that mean ? - Doesn 't exist . Double checked with Swansea . Triple checked . There 's nothing . No such vehicle . But Temple 's been asking about you , Gwen . You in trouble ? I have walked . I have bloody walked . They were here , and then they were gone . And look . There 's nowhere to hide . They just disappeared . Temple 's not just livid . He 's doing his nut . There was a man . I 'm telling you . There was this porter , he was in a porter 's uniform , and he was killed . Or at least he was injured , he must have been injured , right in front of me . This man in a mask sort of lashed out and ... And I have told you . All hospital staff , present and correct . - I saw it . - That 's sick . Gwen , sweetheart , think about it . What sort of story is that ? You 're not well . Come with me , I 'll take you home . - They were here . - Come on . Hey , look at me . Hot pot . Or as the French call it , " hot pot " . I should have phoned . I 've got to work . - You should be off sick . - I know . But they were short and there 's a match on tonight , so I said I 'd take another shift . I 'm sorry . Forgive me . Go on , forgive me . Say you forgive me . - You do , don 't you ? - Yeah . Okay . I got to go . - Enjoy . - Thank you . Excuse me . Gwen Cooper , CID . I 'm making some inquiries round the Bay . I need to check some people out on your list if that 's okay . I don 't suppose you deliver to a Captain Jack Harkness ? - Oh , I don 't know . - Well , could you have a look ? No . He 's not a regular , anyway . J Harkness or just Harkness ? No . Okay , never mind . Thanks anyway . - I don 't suppose you 've got a Torchwood . - Oh , aye . We do them all the time . Good customers . Oh , hiya . Sorry I 'm late . Someone ordered pizza ? - Who 's it for ? - I think it 's a Mr Harkness . Don 't keep him waiting . I can 't do this . I 'm sorry . I 'm rubbish . I give up . He set me off . - Well , that lasted 0.2 seconds . - H mm . She 's actually carrying pizza . Come on . She was gonna say , " Here 's your pizza , " and I was gonna say , " How much ? " And she says , " Oh , whatever , 20 quid , " and I say , " Oh , I don 't have any money . " I was working on a punch line . I 'd have got there , but it would have been good . There 's your pizza . I think I 'd better go . - I think we 've gone past that stage . - You must have been freezing out there . How long you walking round ? Three hours ? - You could see me ? - Mmm-hmm . And before we go any further , who the hell orders pizza under the name of Torchwood ? Uh , yeah , that would be me . Sorry , I 'm a twat . That man at the hospital . That porter . What happened to him ? That was real , wasn 't it ? He was attacked . - He 's dead . - But there 's no one gone missing . We took the body , retrospectively changed the work rota , planted a false witness who saw him leaving the hospital , giving him an alibi for the next 48 hours , so when his body 's pulled out of the docks next Tuesday night , - he 's only been missing for three days . - He was murdered . - Yeah . - And you covered it up . It 's my job . And that other man , John Tucker ? - Last night in the alleyway , I saw you . - And what did you see ? - You revived him . - No . - What did you see ? - You resuscitated him . No . What did you see ? - You brought him back to life . - Yeah . Who are you ? - Torchwood . - What 's Torchwood ? This is Torchwood . All around you . And what happens to me ? - Oh . - I 'm police . Constable Gwen Cooper . You can 't do anything . Right , then , PC Cooper . - Do you want to come see ? - See what ? You saw the murder ... come and see the murderer . Go with him . What is Torchwood ? Who are you ? What is this place ? - What was that ? - Pterodactyl . Are you coming ? It 's all right , it 's safe . It 's sedated . It 's called a Weevil . Or at least , we call them Weevils . We don 't know their real name because they 're not too good at communicating . But we 've got a couple of hundred of them in the city , living in the sewers , feeding off the ... Well , it 's the sewers . You can guess . But every once in a while , one of them goes rogue , comes to the surface , attacks . Actually , it 's been happening more and more and we have no idea why . But it 's alien . Look into its eyes . There you go . Take your time . It was born on a different world , and it 's real . - Owen Harper , Gwen Cooper . - Dr Owen Harper , thank you . Toshiko Sato , computer genius . Suzie Costello , she 's second in command . And this is Ianto Jones . Ianto cleans up after us and gets us everywhere on time . - I try my best . - And he looks good in a suit . Careful . That 's harassment , sir . But why are you telling me their names ? I 'm not supposed to know , am I ? This is classified , isn 't it ? - Way beyond classified . - Then you shouldn 't be telling me . - What are you gonna do to me ? - What do you imagine ? Well , I 've seen too much . Your names and everything , and the Weevil and ... You can dump him out in the water and lie about his death . Okay , Tosh , finish that calibration tomorrow morning . Owen , first thing , get a hold of Chandler and Bell , ' cause I think they 're lying . Ianto , if he needs backup , then you better be on standby . Suzie , I know it 's a pain in the ass , but I need the costing on the glove research . And as for you , you 're coming with me . This way . I 'm getting tired of following you . No , you 're not . And you never will . Stand on here . Come on . Next to me . - Good night . - Later . Now , you came in through the front door . Let 's take the scenic route . But ... But they can see the lift . Why aren 't they , I mean ... We are right out in the open . They can see everything . - Do they look like they can see us ? - No , but look at us . We couldn 't be any more public . Hello ! Hey ! You there ! Hello ! It 's called a perception filter . He can sort of see us , but we don 't quite register . Just like something in the corner of your eye . It only works on this exact spot . Step off ... H i . N ice night . Oh , and lo , we are perceived . - How does it work ? - No idea . We know how to use it , not how it happens , but if I were to guess , I would say that there was once a dimensionally transcendental chameleon circuit placed right on this spot , which welded its perception properties to a spatial-temporal rift . But that sounds kind of ridiculous . Invisible lift has got more of a ring to it , don 't you think ? Hold on , if no one can see it when the lift 's coming up , there 's a bloody big hole in the floor . Don 't people fall in ? - That is so Welsh . - What is ? I show you something fantastic , you find fault . - The thing is , I just don 't understand ... - No , I 'll tell you what I don 't understand . You 're gonna rattle on with that " How can this be true ? " kind of shtick . What 's it gonna take for you people ? If you want evidence of aliens , how about that great big spaceship hovering over London on Christmas day ? What about the Battle of Canary Wharf ? A Cyberman in every home ? My boyfriend says it 's like a sort of terrorism . Like they put drugs in the water supplies , psychotropic drugs , causing mass hallucinations and stuff . Yeah , well , your boyfriend 's stupid . Oh , you 've met him ? So , you catch aliens ? - Yep . - You catch aliens for a living . - Yes , we do . - You 're an alien catcher . - Yes , I am . - Caught any good aliens ? - Tons of them . - That 's a hell of a job . Sure is . This is so weird . And who are you , then ? - Captain Jack Harkness . - I did some research . And there 's only one Captain Jack Harkness on record , and he disappeared in 1941 . Well , that couldn 't be me , could it ? We don 't just catch aliens . We scavenge the stuff they leave behind , find ways of using it , arming the human race for the future . The 2 1 st century 's when it all changes , and you gotta be ready . But who 's in charge of you ? Is it the government , or what ? We 're separate from the government , outside the police , beyond the United Nations . 'Cause if one power got hold of this stuff , they could use it for their own purposes . But so could you . All alien technology stays on the base . No one 's allowed to take anything outside . So go on , then . How the hell did you end up in Cardiff ? This is Torchwood Three . Torchwood One was London , destroyed in the battle . Torchwood Two is an office is Glasgow . Very strange man . Torchwood Three , Cardiff . Torchwood Four has kind of gone missing , but we 'll find it one day . So you just fancied Cardiff ? There 's a rift in space and time running right through the city . The Weevils didn 't come in a spaceship . They kind of just slipped through . All sorts of things get washed up here . Creatures , time shifts , space junk , debris . - Flotsam and jetsam . - Sounds like Cardiff , yeah . Hey , hey , hey , don 't knock it . I 'm a citizen . But where are you from ? - All sorts of places . - Thing is , we could liaise on this . This serial killer . I could be like your liaison with the police . Right , I can see the mistake . You think because we showed up at the scene of crime , - we 're out to catch the killer . - Mmm-hmm . Sorry , nothing to do with us . - Then what were you doing there ? - Testing the glove . We need murder victims , simple as that . The glove only works on the recently deceased , and the more violent the trauma , the stronger the resurrection . All we need is fresh meat . No , you were asking that man , John Tucker . I saw you . - You were asking him about his killer . - He 'd just been murdered . - What else are you gonna ask ? - You could get an ID . You could help . - We 're busy . - And your work is more important . Now you got it . Well , that 's tough shit ' cause if you let me go , then I have a duty . I can tell them what you 've got 'cause that glove could help us . - If you remember . - What do you mean ? How 's your drink ? - Have you poisoned me ? - Don 't be so dramatic . It 's an amnesia pill . My own recipe with a touch of denial and a dash of retcon . Wake up tomorrow morning and you 'll have forgotten everything about Torchwood . Worse still , you 'll have forgotten me . Which is kind of tragic . Don 't think you can fight it by staying awake . I mixed in a little bit of sedative , too . Then I 'll tell someone . Do you want to do that ? Do you really want us to come and find them , too ? - You bastard . - Language . N ice knowing you , Gwen Cooper . - Hello . - All right . - You having a good time ? - I was . - Can I buy you a drink ? - No , thanks . I 'm fine . - Am I wasting my time ? - I don 't know . Are you ? Look , I 've got to be up early . I 've got a hell of a day tomorrow , and I really can 't be bothered with all the chat . So , do you want a drink , or what ? Bloody hell fire . You 're coming home with me , you are . Right now ! Oi , you bastard . Come here ! Linda ! What are you doing with him ? What the fuck do you think you 're doing ? I 'm taking him home and I 'm having him . Now piss off . What the fuck do you think you 're doing with my girlfriend , you bastard ? Hey ! I didn 't know . She was on her own . She never said . - You tosser . You fucking tosser . - Colin , button it . He 's mine . You want to have a go , do you ? You want to have a go ? Come on , mate . Well , if it makes it easier ... - I 'm so having you . - I 'm having him first . Taxi ! Did you get pissed ? No . - What time is it ? - 7 : 30 . - You said you were working last night . - I was . Then how come you fell asleep in here ? I haven 't . I was typing . - That is work . - I 'm not having a go . Just saying . Not exactly clever going out on the lash when you 've just had a bang on the head . Hope you didn 't drive in that state . Who were you with ? Diane ? Must have been . Yeah . - Have any luck ? - With what ? Captain Jack Harkness . - How do you mean ? Who 's he ? - Oh , don 't worry about me . Just go ahead wasting my time . - H i . - H i . - Aye , aye . Come to see where the real work 's done . - Yes , sir . That 's right , sir . - How 's it going ? - Sod all . Is that the murder weapon ? Clever , mind . They worked it all out on a computer . Took measurements from the stab wounds . Calculated the shape of the blade and stuff . Even those prongs . I don 't know how they do it . Nasty looking beast , though . - Do you recognise it ? - No . We 're trying to trace it . Can 't be that many of them . Sort of ornamental . We 're checking the CDE logs with customs in case it 's been imported . Find the knife , we might find the killer . Anyway , if it rings any bells , give us a shout . Yeah . Thanks . I said to Geoff it 's vital , but was he having any of it ? No , he 's off and moaning , says , " Who books the ground ? Who pays the subs ? " Like we 're ganging up on him . Practically said so . And all the time he 's wheezing away and he 's getting more and more heated , and I am like , " Geoff ... " ... said , " You 're in charge of transport . " I said , " Mam , I can 't go hopping on a truck " just to come and pay you a visit . " And that set off her then . Should 've heard it . All that Christmas stuff all over again . I was like , " Oh , for God 's sake , leave it . " Hello , again . You were right . You told Jack we should liaise with the police . I was the only one who bothered so ... I was the only one who saw the report . They got a good likeness . I 'm arresting you for ... - How do I know you ? - I thought you might have seen it , and that can trip the amnesia , just one specific image if you 're clever . He said you were good . Anyway ... it 's not much good now , I can 't really ... You were gonna put up a fight , so I 've got ... Erm ... hold on . Sorry . There , that 's better . - Put it down . - You had to come back . - Put down the gun . - You 're the only one who can make the link . Well , the only one in public . Torchwood 's gonna find out by morning , but I 'll be gone . I don 't know where . Far away . What am I gonna do ? I loved this job . I really loved it . And now I 've got to run . Oh , Christ . How can you do any other job after this one ? - Please , put down the gun . - ' Cause it gets inside you . You do this job for long enough and you end up thinking ... How come we get all the Weevils and bollocks and shit ? Is that what alien life is ? Filth ? But maybe there 's better stuff out there . Brilliant stuff . Beautiful stuff . Just , they don 't come here . This planet 's so dirty , that 's all we get . The shit . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I wish I could forget . - Why did you kill those people ? - For the glove . Just ... Just stay where you are . I needed the bodies . That 's how it works . Violent death . It was so easy . To bring them by , I just position myself behind the head so they never see me twice . - You killed three people . - It was the only way . The more I use the glove , the more I control it . I don 't understand . What glove ? Where have I seen you before ? If I can get enough practice , then think what the glove could do . If I could get it to work all the time on anything , beyond the two minutes , if it could work permanently , it could resurrect . Resurrection on demand for the whole world . Isn 't that good ? Isn 't it , though ? Well , that 's what I 've been working for . All day and all night . The rest of them go swanning about while I 'm working . You got to get inside this stuff . You surrender yourself to it . I did with the knife and the glove . And that 's why the perception filter isn 't gonna work on me . What ? Who is he ? Where did he come from ? What have you done ? - Please don 't . - I can 't let you go . - Please . - I 've got to . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 've got to . I 've got to . I 've got to . Put down the gun . Suzie , it 's over . Now , come with me . I remember . Owen and Toshiko , you didn 't tell them that you were shot in the head and survived . You didn 't tell them either . Followed my lead . Keep doing that , and you might just get through this . But she killed you . - I can 't die . - Okay . But I can 't . Something happened to me a while back . Long story and far away . But I was killed ... and then I was brought back to life , and ever since then ... I can 't die . - But how ... - I don 't know . One day I 'll find a doctor , the right sort of doctor , and maybe he can explain it , but until then ... Nothing kills you ? Well , it kind of freaks people out so ... Best if you don 't say anything . It doesn 't matter anyway . You 'll only wipe my memory again . Why would I do that ? Torchwood 's got a vacancy . Job going spare . - Do you want it ? - But ... - What do you need me for ? - ' Cause maybe you were right . We could do more to help . What do you think ? Do you want to join up ? Yeah . I do . Yes . Is that plane on fire ? I 've got to go to work . So let 's see what we came for . There 's an alien on the loose . We don 't know where it is , why it 's here , or what it 's gonna do . The overriding factor for the parasite is to have sex . It 's a struggle between where Carys ends and the alien begins . Sorry ? What 's this for ? Please help me !

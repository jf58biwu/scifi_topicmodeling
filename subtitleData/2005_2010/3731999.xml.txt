That 's A Shame . How Can I Tell You What I Don 't Know ? Dg , Where Are You ? Mother ? Dg , Where Are You ? What Have You Done With Her ? Put Her Away For Safe-Keeping . Like Any Good Daughter Would . Where ? Somewhere You Will Never Find Her . Go ! Go ! Wait ! Bring Her To Me . Now I Know Why They Call You Zero . Still Can 't Fight Your Own Battles . I Do My Share . Dg ! Bring Him . Put Me Down ! No Iron Suit For You This Time . No Wife And Child Crying For Years To Free You From It . My Family 's Alive ? Hardly Matters Now . Glitch ! Ah ! Welcome Back , Little Sister . There 's No Place Like The O. Z. Mother ? I missed you . I don 't even know you . Your light is strong . Let it guide you through your memories . I 'm a waitress , and a part-time student . I don 't think i can do this . I 'm scared . When you were a girl , i used to rock you at our special place . Remember . Dg , breakfast ! Wind last night made a real mess a things . Branches took out a transformer . Well , you better fix it before it fixes us . Come on , woman , i can 't work on an empty tank . Besides , i need our expert on this one , if she ever wakes up . Morning , sleepyhead . All right ... Was i asleep ? Dead to the world for 14 hours . Figured you must 've had something on your mind . Lord knows i have . I was wrong , dg . You have a right to your own life . I had no business looking through your stuff last night . That was last night ? Had that crazy nightmare again , huh ? In technicolor . Well , you 're awake now so you better help your dad before he wrecks this place . But , the farm was wrecked . Mercy me . Have you been having those chili cheese fries before bed again ? But your stories must have worked their way into my subconscious , because there was a frozen lake and a palace , and my mother was a queen , and she was trying to get me to remember this thing about an emerald , so i could stop my evil sister . Well , did you ? Remember , i mean ? No , and when i didn 't , she sicked these monkey-bats on me . Well , you got the storm part right , baby girl . We got a heck of mess to clean up . That 's the cold hard reality . Finally talking some sense . Heck with that . You know i 'd pick a good story over work any day . I 'd rather hear the big secret about that emerald the queen whispered into your ear . Aw , popsicle , i can 't remember . It was something ... What something , honey ? I never said she whispered anything into my ear . Sorry , baby girl , guess i blew it . It 's okay , popsicle . I know you tried your best . That was all fake ? You are twisted . Why ? Because with a little re-wiring , i 've gotten something i 've missed out on for too long ? A father 's love , a mother 's affection . Where are my real parents . Our parents ? Well , daddy , the thief , abandoned us after you ... Died . Mother never forgave him for that . Had his name officially banished from the lands . Ever the drama queen . Where is she ? There came a time when she had to be ... Isolated . Mother ? Dg , where are you ? Let her go . That can be arranged , but first you have to do something for me . Fear not , my child , there is one thing that can stop her . The emerald of the eclipse . The secret to finding it now lives inside of you . When the time is right , you will return . Dg , just ... Tell me where the emerald is . Just tell me what she whispered to you , and i will take you to her . I promise . I don 't remember . That was a long time ago . We can pry those memories out of her . Zero , she 's my sister . I guess i haven 't really made this much of a family reunion , have i ? Well , i wasn 't expecting a picnic . I want to show you something , share something with you . " the majestic queen of the O.Z. had two lovely daughters , she . " " double eclipse it is foreseen , light meets dark in the stillness between , " " but only one and one alone , shall hold the emerald and take the throne . " So , what is that ? The great and ominous prophecy of the O.Z. It 's a nursery rhyme . A few couplets that roll pleasingly off the tongue . It 's not who we are , dg . You tried to kill me . I was just a child you know , i ... I foolishly believed the part about " only one and one alone . " and you don 't now ? No . I believe that the prophecy can be what you and i make of it . Dg , we were such good friends . We spent hours imaging what the O.Z. Would be like when we grew up . Please , you must remember that . We were friends ? We 'd explore the woods , gather apples , skip little stones across the lake . We made mother crazy with worry . Apples ? No . I 'm not buying what you 're doing with this whole " keys to the kingdom " crap . I 'm not doing anything . I just want what the prophecy can bring to both of us . It 's our birthright . It 's our chance to make a new O.Z. Just tell me where it is . I don 't rember . Dg ... My lovely little sister . That was the wrong ... Answer . Now we do it your way . I 'll take her for a reading with lylo . If you rember nothing else , remember this . The next time i snuff out your insignificant little life , there 'll be no one standing by to save you . Raw ? Cain ... Now it 's dinner for three . Lylo ... No ! He 's not one of us anymore . No iron suit for you this time . No wife and child crying for years to free you from it . My family 's alive ? My family 's alive ? My family 's alive ? You been sleeping for hours like a ... Like a baby with his pacifier . I thought you were dead . Ditto . You know , i may have saved you from hypothermia , but ... This is what saved your life . It stopped the bullet . Dg ... Azkadellia . Raw ? I don 't know , i can 't find him . Either they took him , too , or ... - He 's dead , or- - - maybe he ran away . You know , you really should do something about that bitter cynicism of yours , cain . Why ? Someone 's got to keep your wide-eyed optimism in check . Hey , glitch ... What ? I owe you one . You know , cain , professional psychiatric therapy is only a crow 's call away these days . I think a man like you with your issues of masculinity , and the ... Well , we call it the " boy scout syndrome ... " no ... Leave him alone ! No ... No ! No ... No ! Stop ! Stop ! A whisper , lylo . All i 'm looking for is a secret whispered to a little girl ! Lylo can 't find . - Focus ! - Something protecting her memories ! Break through . Now ! Lylo is trying ! Don 't try ! Do ! How can he rember , if i can 't ? What did mother whisper into dg 's ear about the emerald ? Emerald ... Only thing can stop Azkadellia . Focus , lylo ! Where is it ? All is gray ! Emerald within the gray gale . Gray gale ? What is the gray gale ? Don 't know . Can 't see . Where is it ? Hurts to reach into her memories . Memories surrounded by ... Magic . Lylo ! Magic ? I don 't have to guess who 's responsible for that , do i ? Mother ... More secrets ? You 've cloaked dg 's memories with your magic . You 're the one who forced secrets into our lives . Well , you did your work a little too well . All traces of the gray gale are gone . She 'll never remember now . Are you surprised i know about the gray gale ? What do you know ? Learn to love me , mother . Learn to trust me , and i will give you back your throne . Put the crown upon your head , and kneel at your feet . The loyal daughter you always dreamed of . You 're not my daughter . You 're ... How could you say such a thing ? - You made me who i am . - No . Tell me where the emerald is . Not while there 's still a breath in my body . Raw sorry ... Raw run away . Raw scared . We all scared . Don 't let them do this to kalm . He needs us . Needs you . Sleep . This one will read the girl next . Take him to the gilded hall for initialization . No ! Oh , please ... Try again . Lylo ... Lylo ? Raw ? What are you looking at ? I have a theory which can 't be unproven . Mystic man ? You 're alive ! It is called ... The " or not " theory . Oh , i have so much to tell you . Ah , ah , ah ... You know that they wouldn 't put you in a cell near mine unless they wanted to hear us talk . She 's . She 's listening ? First , you must journey to the north , or not . Yes , i journeyed to the north . I went to the ice palace , and i know who my mother is . Are you sure you 're not still on the vapors ? I 've never been clearer in my whole life . It 's all coming back to me . My troubled childhood , a rich life of scholarly pursuit , my brief but glamorous life in show business , although that part is a little bit hazy . Did you feel that ? Yeah . They 're testing a machine . What sort of machine ? The complete destruction of the O.Z. Is that why she needs the emerald ? O ... Kay . What are we going to do ? There is so much i would like to tell you , but . Azkadellia 's eyes and ears are all over us now . Okay . Tell me what you know about the ... The gray gale is a myth ... Dreamt up by the ancients to entertain their children . Time to change tack . Long time no see . Azkadellia ? A little older , a lot smarter , and most definitely still in charge . Nothing like a violent coup to win the hearts and minds of a kingdom . Good . You still have a memory . It may be the one thing that can save you . What do you want ? What i want is the very thing you 've devoted your feeble life to . Magic , my friend . Those who can 't do , teach . Remember ? Your freedom for your help . My help ? I mean , i 'm not saying they called me twinkle toes , or anything , but i cut quite a rug . Oh , you can make a face , cain , but it 's true . There was a time when i was a fantastic dancer . She may have taken my brains , but rhythm ! That comes directly from your- - do you have any bright ideas how to get in there ? I mean , i don 't mind taxing my half brain for dg , but just once i wish that someone would acknowledge me for my rhythm , which as i was trying to say before i was so rudely interrupted , comes directly from the soul . Sometimes , cain , you make me feel just like those ladies at the dance did , like i blend right into the wallpaper . That 's a good idea . You want to dance ? I 'll lead , you follow . What i can tell you is that your mother cloaked your memories in magic , so that azkadellia cannot get to them . Great . The only thing is , neither can i . Yes , you can . You know what , my mother was really good with the " to-do " list , she just wasn 't so good with the " how-to-do " lists . She said you must unlock your memories . Your light must brighten a place that is dark . In the south . It 's where you 'll find a message about your future and your past . Fiery , aren 't they ? Never seen ' em that large . Left , left ! Left , right , left ! Left , left ! Left , right , left ! You 're a deep well , glitch . It 's all about rhythm . Come on , let 's go . So eager to please the wrong sister . Azkadellia ... As i live and breathe . So far . I don 't know which is more pathetic , you on the vapors or off . Your sister is more powerful than you . She will never ... be as powerful as me . Then why are you so scared ? I know you ... Witch . What do you know ? Stop , az ! Stop it ! Unlock your memories . Not so great and terrible after all , huh ? Hey ! Do i know you ? Hey ... Thanks . My friend 's this way . Dg ? Dg ! Raw ! Are you okay ? Let 's get you out of here . longcoats . That could bust a zipper . Glitch ... Hey there , princess . Cain , you 're alive ! Barely . Furry lips here really packs a punch . We 've got to get out of here . Well , we can 't get out the way we came in . This way . Come on . Dg ! Which way ? Which way ? You 're taking directions from a dog . Left or left ? I 've got them , sir ! Longcoats ! I think he wants us to go in there . I think we 'd better hurry . Let 's go . You 're a good boy ! You knew the way ! It 's okay . It 's okay , i 'm a friend , i 'm a friend of your mother 's . She sent me to help . We 'd better go . We 've got an emerald to find . Good , good . Are you ready , kid ? Yeah . That machine that we escaped through ? The mystic man said that she was going to use that to destroy the O.Z. Wait a second . You saw the mystic man ? He 's dead . She killed him . He said that she needs the emerald to make the machine work . That 's interesting . How ? Folks ... I suggest we keep moving . Sorry , pooch , but this is where we part company . Part ? With the longcoats on our trail and the mobats in the sky , i don 't have time to figure out what your angle is in all of this . My angle is her mother sent me to help . And you did . I 'd even thank you for what you did back there if i knew who you were , or what . Whoa . Mr.Suspicious , this is the man ... Dog ... Thingie ... Who helped us escape ! - Shape-shifter . - Yes . Yes , Mr.Raw. He knew your name . How did you know his name ? I know all of your names . You 're Mr.Glitch , former advisor to the queen herself , Mr.Raw , a viewer of extraordinary skill , and you , Mr.Cain you were a tin man on the mystic man 's protection detail . You 're all quite famous in the O.Z. And quite in demand . Dead or alive . That is a terrible picture of me . Mmm ... Now , look , i 'm sorry if i scared any of you back there , but there 's never really a great time for the old beast-into-man moment . You just ... Wham ! And hope for the best . I don 't know . You 're still a stranger . Am i ? Let 's just see about that . Hey , that 's mine . It was yours when you were a child . Whoa . Am i really doing this ? Indeed you are . Magic 's in your blood . Let it shed light on your past so that you may better face your future . Now , concentrate , dg . Concentrate . Concentrate , dg . You must let the light flow through you effortlessly . Remember , light as air . To ... It 's tutor . Now , focus . I am , but this thing won 't float ! It will . It wants to . Just concentrate , deeg . Yes ! Yes ! Tutor . You were our tutor . Before you were sent over to the other side , your mother put a spell on all of your memories , in case you were ever taken into the wrong hands . So i 've been told . Well , she sent me now to help you reawaken the memories you 'll need to find the gray gale , and the emerald of the eclipse . Wait , how did you see her if she 's in azkadellia 's prison ? She came to me in a dream , but she 's growing weaker and weaker . There 's no time to waste . Mystic man said to head south . Then that 's exactly what we should do . Don 't you think , cain ? South ? Yes , that 's-that 's what i meant . Excuse me . South . Unfortunately , the only road to the south leads through the fields of p-pay . P-Pay ... - I should kill you ! - Shh ! She 's in conference . And i will . I will ... My men just told me that wyatt cain is alive . He was here . If she finds out . Finds out what ? That you 're utterly incapable of putting one man in his grave ? I shot him out a window into a freezing lake . That man has nine lives . He 's not the only one . Xora ... That 's my girl . She 's heading south . My men will blitz the area immediately . No , they won 't . You have them dead to rights , and you don 't want to take her ? No . I want her to lead me straight to the emerald . You 've planted a spy . Just keeping an eye on her , as any concerned big sister would . I want you to shadow her . Don 't get too close . Think you can handle a little restraint , zero ? That can 't be good . Hunter parties are out . Stay sharp . Did it always look so dead ? No , this used to be some of the most fertile land in the O.Z. So , what happened ? Well , about 15 annuals ago , all the crops died , which then caused a great famine . I bet i can guess who 's responsible . Yeah . You 'd think somebody would 've helped them with their crops , maybe ... Engineered a doohickey with a couple ... Thingies ... Got to love a good orchard . Papay once peaceful . Yeah ? Well , now the only peace they 're interested in is a piece of us ! Were farmers . Now hunters . No wonder they 're desperate . - They don 't have any food- - - shh , shh ! Runner scouts . They 're signaling to the others . Run ! Ah ! Good boys . Good boys . Com it 's almost dinner-time . Dg ... Use your gift . To do what ? Focus , dg . You 've got it in you . I don 't know how . Just focus . It isn 't working . Why are they bowing ? Thanking us . That is one heck of a defense , kid . Good , dg . Let 's get out of here . Come on.Easy ... Thank you . Let 's go , let 's go . Dg , my darling . You 're shaking like a leaf . What 's wrong ? She fell , and i let go . Oh , what are you talking about ? There 's az right there . You okay ? Yeah . It looked like you were having a nightmare , a bad one . Dg dream of azkadellia . Yeah . She told me once that we were friends when we were little , and i didn 't believe her , but now i 'm not so sure . Maybe your dream 's trying to tell you something . In my dream , i 'm scared , and my mother is rocking me on a swing ... In a special place . A beautiful place by a lake . Well , there 's about a hundred lakes just south of here . - Dg know which lake . - No , i don 't . Yo u do , dg . Because you were there before , as a little girl . Try . What was it like ? It was ... magical . To get to lake country , we have to cut across the crack in the O.Z. This ain 't going to be easy . I brought you a gift . Bulgar novi . Once extinct in the fields of the papay . I thought i 'd never enjoy their fragrance again . I suppose some things thought dead aren 't always so . Save the poetry for someone who cares . What do you want ? The little witch is reconnecting with her past . Then hope lives . And what about you , azkadellia ? Perhaps dg isn 't the only one who needs to unlock her memories . I 'm only concerned with the future . Then why are you here talking to me ? Why have you locked me away for all these years , kept my hope alive ? To see your face the day that hope dies . Can 't we rest ? I 'm tired . No time . We have to get to finaqua . I 'd give my last synapse for a juicy apple . - Apples ... - What is it ? Something azkadellia said . We 'd explore the woods , gather apples ... Clever how you tricked that old tree to throw fruit at us . I heard tell of it once in a story from the past . We should get back before mother realizes we 're gone , or we 'll be history , too . We are not supposed to be out here alone . She says there 's wild animals in the forest . Did you say what kind of wild animals ? Lions , and tigers , and ... Oh my ! Just hold my hand , deeg ! Nothing can hurt us if we stay together ! Azkadellia , what happened to you ? Hey , kiddo ... Are you coming ? Yeah . They won 't be puttin ' a zipper on that gaper . Longcoats everywhere . Yeah , we 're not getting past them in broad daylight . The eclipse is almost upon us . We don 't have any time to waste . Look , quick and dead might be okay with you , dogman , but i 'll take slow and breathing any time . Even then , we 're going to need some help . Cabin . Probably full of longcoats . No . Look at the smoke . So they lit a fire . Longcoats get cold , too . It 's blue . Come on . State your business . We mean you no harm . We 're travelers of the realms seeking a warm meal and a cold cup of grog . Food is scarce this time of year , and the grog has long since been seized . Then we will leave you in peace . May your hearth be warm . And your smoke be blue . Come in , quickly . Thank you ... For your help . I 'm that 's my wife , lorraine . Put your gun on the table . They 're friends , lorraine . No such thing anymore . It 's okay . We just need shelter till it 's safe to cross . It 's never safe . But the cover of night will help . Until then , sit , rest . Newom the resistance in the east ? Well , i was hoping that you would tell us . Do you know anything about a machine that azkadellia 's building ? Only rumors . We helped a captain from the lowlands . All he said was that azkadellia was pushing the miners and the metalworkers till they dropped . What mine ? Some mine in the black mountains . Mauritanium . Big " m " , little " t " . Number 216 in the ozian periodic table . School dys . - I remember a lovely lass named leona who - - mauritanium . What 's it for ? Besides its strength , mauritanium is valued for its ability to conduct magical energy . So if she gets ahold of the emerald , she can focus the power however she wants . Not if we get to it first . So it 's a weapon . No , it 's a sunseeder . What 's a sunseeder ? I don 't know , but it sounds cool . Oh , wait ... I invented it . What 's it used for ? I can 't remember . I can 't remember . I 'm sorry , we don 't have time for this . We have to know . Raw ? Calibrating the sequencing is a delicate process . Will it work ? It will work perfectly , sorceress . You have planned well , and nothing will stand in your way . | ? I 'm not so sure about all this . Glitch ... If azkadellia 's building a machine that you designed , you might be the key to stopping her . I am talking about fluffy diving into my cranium . Invasion of my privacy and all ... Dark day . Majesty , i bring bad news . The princess azkadellia has seized central city . Have our men pull back . To the south . What ? The fourth brigade has fallen . General lonot has defected . He was our most loyal friend . I 'm so sorry . There was no law other than azkadellia 's . She tried to steal the plans for the sunseeder . But i was able to destroy the blueprints . She 'll come after you , ambrose . Is there nothing you can do , majesty ? Too late . The darkness is too deeply rooted in her . But your light . You are the most powerful being in all of the O.Z. Was , old friend . I gave my power and my light to save someone very special . My angel ... Show some respect . The queen 's reign ends today . Do you have any idea what you are doing ? I do . You need a long rest , mother . Take her away , and take him to the alchemist . If you won 't tell me what you know , i guess i 'll just have to reach in and take it myself . Remove the brain slowly . No ... Please don 't-don 't do this . Please , it won 't-it won 't work . - Please . - Count back from 100 . please ... Please ! 99 ... Don 't do it.Don 't ... 98 ... 97 ... 96 ... Oh , my ... Uh , the name 's glitch , have we ... Are you okay ? Yes , glitch , i 'm fine . What ? Was my machine so bad ? No . But whatever it is , you sure sacrificed a lot to stop azkadellia . That 's why she had to go straight to the source . Oh , i guess it wasn 't the biggest sacrifice ever made for science . But it sure is up there . The time to go is now . Full dark and the moons have yet to rise . You okay ? I 'm disappointed in myself . My mother gave up her power to bring me back to life , and that 's how azkadellia was able to take over . You know , kiddo , there are some things in life that are just ... Out of our control . But we need you . You got to let it go . Come on . - Where did you get this ? - We should go . Where did you get this ? A resistance fighter made it for my son . He came through a few months back with his mother . I think their names were- - jeb ... And adora . My family , they really are alive . You 're a lot like her , you know . She wasn 't always all ermine robes and " thee 's " and " thou 's " . She started out just like you . Feisty but fair . My mother 's done so much for me , and i don 't even know her name . Oh , well , that 's easy . Her name was queen ... It 's okay . But she was happy to make the sacrifices she thought were right . We should all love someone that much . Come on . Quickly . Help me with this . Come on . We hide it as best we can . Good . Get it all . There is not much time . Your family crossed this same line , friend . Said they were headed to an old cabin about three spans on the other side , tucked behind a giant white elm , the only one there . Thank you . - We should thank you . - All right , come on . I 'm too big for that thing . Did i ever tell you i was afraid of heights ? You were hanging from the ceiling when i met you . Involuntarily ! If you shape-shift , i swear i 'll dr . - You okay ? - Yeah . All right , let 's go . There . That 's it . That 's where my family made their new home . I really don 't think there 's time for this . He 's always made time for us . Adora ! Jeb ! Adora ! ? j They crossed the gorge . Why continue south ? Nothing there but wasteland and ... Finaqua . That 's the first place you searched for the emerald years ago . It seems the light is helping the pure of heart . Zero awaits your orders . Should he ride to finaqua ? No , and tell him not to get too close . Your son , jeb , still lives . No . He lives to honor you . I feel it . You feel too much . Come on , let 's get a move on . You 've sent her into the heart of darkness , mother . Why finaqua ? She needs to know what she 's up against . Which way now ? Well , both ways head south . Your mother said your memories would guide you , dg . Let them . I don 't know , it looks familiar . Well , dig deeper . Remember , dg . I remember ... Her swinging me on a swing , and the suns reflecting in my eyes , and the breeze off the water . Oh , what 's that ? No ! Sorceress ! Water.Water ... Right away . Xora ? What happened ? Little beastie just came out of nowhere . Why did it attack now ? Probably a random hit . It 's dead now . Great . Maybe we should just move along like it never happened . Never happened ? Once az finds out that this one 's missing , she 's going to have longcoats crawling all over the zone looking for it . All the more reason to get moving . You okay ? You 're sweating up a storm . I 'm fine . I know . Come on ! What is this ? - She 's found something . - Come on . This way , come on . Dg ! Where are we ? Dg this way . Dg ? Where is she ? - I just saw her . - Where ? Dg ! Come on , come on . You were right about the magical waters , dg . That 's what " finaqua " means in the ancient 's language . Not sure about the translation now though . This used to be paradise . Not paradise now . It was one of the first places az scorched when she came to power . Well , she sure didn 't leave much . No . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble ... What was that ? Wait , guys , let her find it alone . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take them they will never know ... did you hear that ? Hear what ? Let 's go see what it is . No , we should get back . Mom said to stay close . If we did everything mom said , we 'd never have any fun . Come on , it 's like an adventure . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take them they will never know two little princesses dancing in a row dancing in a row dancing in a row ... Remember . Help ! Do you hear that ? We should go get mom and dad . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble . Hello ! Look at this . It 's the picture language of the ancients . N you tell what it means ? Some . At the dawn of time , good battled evil , and the light conquered over the darkness , and something about an evil witch ... Well ... That was fun . Wait . What is this place ? It looks ancient . Maybe it 's a tomb . I 'm not sure , but that face creeps me out . Let 's go . Don 't you t ? there 's someone trapped in there . Dg ! What have we done ? Hey , are you okay ? No , wait . How did you get re ? Help me ! Our parents aren 't far . We 'll go and bring back help . No ! I mean ... Please , don 't leave me alone . I 've been waiting ... Calling . I thought this day would never come . The magic is strong in you . Let go . No . - Don 't let go . - But i 'm scared . We have to stay together . Yo u can let go , little girl . No . T go no ! Dg my darling , you 're shaking like a leaf . What 's wrong ? Az ... She fell , and i let go . What are you talking about ? There 's az right there . Azkadellia , are you all right ? Of course , mother . I 've never felt better . I 'm sorry , my sister . All the terrible things that have happened , they were all my fault . I should never have let go . Excuse the interruption , sorceress , but without xora 's reports , zero would like to know if you 'd wish him to pick up the trail . I will pick up the trail myself . Find her . Hey ... You still in that cave ? I just feel so bad that I led her in there . You can 't blame yourself . It 's because of me that the witch got out . Look , you were just a kid . And I ran . You 're not running now , are you ? Your light must brighten a place that is dark . What is it , another memory ? It 's where you 'll find a message about your future and your past . I just need to find my mother 's message . Where ? Here in finaqua . Concentrate , Dg . Flat rocks fly . Round rocks die . How 's she going to find anything now ? The palace , the lake are gone . Azkadellia 's torched the place . Shh ! Quiet , glitch . We need to find the perfect stone . Come on . It 's perfect ! Let 's save it . We 'll hide it for the perfect day . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take them no one ever knows two little princesses dancing in a row ... I hope this is the perfect day . Dg , if you 're seeing this message , Then you 've overcome much on your journey to find the emerald . The emerald of the eclipse contains the power to bring either light or darkness to the O. Z. As you now know , the evil witch of the dark lives inside your sister . That is why she knows not of my plan And why I could only entrust the emerald 's power to you , my angel . Make haste now , south to the realm of the unwanted . There you must find a man named Ahamo . He will help you in the final leg of your journey To save the O. Z. To the gray gale , to the emerald . Wait ! Who 's Ahamo ? Ahamo is your father . I 'm so sorry , Sorceress . Wait for me here . I go into finaqua alone . You 've brought finaqua back . It 's perfect ! We 'll hide it , For the perfect day . Flat rocks fly . Round rocks die . Ah ... Dg , if you 're seeing this message , Then you 've overcome much on your journey to find the emerald . The emerald of the eclipse contains the power to bring either light or darkness to the O. Z. As you now know , the evil witch of the dark lives inside your sister . Make haste now south to the realm of the unwanted . There you must find a man named Ahamo . He will help you in the final leg of your journey To save the O. Z. To the gray gale . To the emerald . How very clever , mother . Hey , pooch . You okay over there ? You 've just been antsy as a guild fighter since we left finaqua . I 'm ... Just nervous about being a man on the run , I suppose . Yeah , I hear you . The sky 's clear . Yeah . But I get this funny feeling that we 're being followed . What do you think ? Another mobat ? Didn 't you say it was probably just a random scout Who just stumbled across us ? Didn 't you say we should pretend it never happened ? You were sweating then , too . Let go of me ! Let go - I 'd shoot you in the heart if I thought you had one . Cain ... What are those ? Bread crumbs for Azkadellia . She had an inside man all along , didn 't she ? A spy . Tutor ? Your trail ends here . You don 't understand . I stopped dropping those a while back . Afraid you 'd get caught ? But you were family . I still am , Dg . I care more about you than anybody else in the whole wide world . Then why would you do that ? For the last ... 15 annuals , I 've been locked up in a dark hole . Azkadellia came to me . She offered me my freedom if I 'd track you . If I had said no , She would have killed me on the spot . So I figured , At least I could keep her off your back while you rediscover your magic . But if that were the truth , why did you drop those disks ? Why didn 't you let us get away clean ? You know as well as I do that would have never worked . She would have been on us quick as death . Now , look , you guys , Whether you like it or not , Those things bought us valuable time . Why didn 't you tell me sooner ? I swear , Dg , I was just about to . I think it 's time to put this dog down . No . We 're all looking for second chances . Toto , too . Thank you , Dg . It doesn 't mean that I trust you , But we 're almost at the realm , And you 're the only one Well , we can 't just let him walk . Maybe we could keep him on a short leash . That 's a good idea . If you really mean what you say , you won 't mind traveling with us as Tutor . One wrong move , and I 'll take you on a walk you don 't come back from . You hear me ? Yeah . Now that we know that Azkadellia had a spy , She 's a lot closer than we thought we 've got to pick it up a notch . Come on , let 's go . Come on . My mother and father planned all this from the beginning , didn 't they ? They know all about us , don 't they ? They knew , and they left you for dead . I on the other hand , will never leave you . Think ! Ahamo is a man weak of heart , blinded by emotion , nostalgic , sentimental . He was so happy here . That 's it . That 's it . There must be a trace we can follow . Dg 's not the only one who can remember , is she ? Remember . Focus . Dg ? Leave them here . He 'll find them when he comes back with mother . Do you think father will know they 're from us ? Well , he told us to make him something he could keep forever , and he taught us how to sculpt clay . What if they 're touched with our magic ? Good idea . Now he 'll definitely know . Come on . Daddy . You loved that sappy little token of your daughters 'love , didn 't you ? I bet you still have it with you , glowing bright as a beacon . Go find the glow . Find Ahamo . What ? Trust me , the realm of the unwanted is here . Somewhere . I think he 's found something . Come on . I 'm fine . Where 'd he go ? Over there ! Come on . Come on . Yeah . Well , that 's some you don 't see everyday . Careful , Dg , careful . Easy ... Yeah , come on , let 's go . Come on ... Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . Come on , come on . Glitch , come on ! Come on ! Cain , uh , help a zipperhead out with a memory or two . In this realm , who exactly are the unwanted ? Criminals , outlaws , and a few living experiments gone wrong . Oh , and my father 's here ? How odd . Hey , look . What 's he doing now ? - I don 't know . Anybody got any money ? ASK AIROFDAY QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERS UNSPOKEN Can 't say they didn 't welcome us with open arms . Questions are answers unspoken . Isn 't it a little cramped in there ? Reference is to uncomfortable tight spaces . Answer , yes . Isn 't that good ? Okay . We got to go find Ahamo . Answer , Ahamo is a hard man to find . You know him ? More money . Answer , know personally ? No . Okay , great . Thank you for nothing . Goodbye . We were told Ahamo was here in the realm . Reply , know of one who might know this Ahamo . Answer , the seeker . Where can we find the seeker ? And you thought I had trouble with directions . The seeker doesn 't talk to just anybody . Doesn 't like strangers . He 'll like us . Where is he ? I might be able to arrange a meeting . Really ? What 's the catch ? 20 platinums . 20 platinums ? Done . Where is this meeting place ? Local tavern at the edge of the realm . Meet there at the rising of the first moon after midnight . We 'll be there . Airofday . Seeker . They are looking for Ahamo . They asked for him by name ? Yes . I 've been seeking Ahamo many years . He holds valuable secrets . You can ask them all the questions you want before we turn them in . I am offering you my usual split for your help . Are you in ? I am , But we do it my way , just the two of us . Oh , daddy ... I don 't like the looks of this place . Why don 't you guys wait outside ? I 'll cut the deal myself . No , I think we should ... Stick together . I feel very safe with you guys . Really ? I don 't . You , sit and stay . There 's nothing to be afraid of . Where can we find the seeker ? I 'm here . We were told that you knew where to find Ahamo . Show me your palm . What for ? Do you want my help or not ? It 's okay . The other one . Now ! We had a deal ! Put me down ! I can 't see ! Get us out of here ! - Dg Dg ... WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE Yeah , that 's right , abuse the guy with the zipperhead . It amazes me that you once influenced the queen . I know . Me too . But she wouldn 't be very proud of me right now , Though , being empty-headed enough to let her daughter walk right into a trap . Yeah , you and me both . Look ! Toto ! Hey , toto , come on , show these longcoats what you 're really made of . He just did . I believe you owe me something . A slow death or a quick one . Didn 't I capture three of the most wanted men in the zone ? What you did was stick your six greedy little hands into something far bigger than a bounty . Get rid of her . What ? No . No , zero , don 't do this . Give me my money . Zero ! Word from the Sorceress . We should return to the tower . At least I 'll have a souvenir to remember you by . Why don 't you unshackle me . I 'll teach you how to use it . You surprise me , cain . Not a lot of men make it out of the iron suit with their sense of humor intact . Let 's see how funny you are when you 're ... Hanging from the gallows in central city square . Let 's go ! Going somewhere ? What haou done with my friends ? Well , last I saw of them , they were putting up a good fight . Oh , so you only get a quarter of the bounty . I didn 't take you for the money . Oh ... Where I come from , freaks like you drive vans . Dg , you don 't understand , So just calm yourself . Calm myself ? I 'm not a kidnapper . Okay , so take me to my friends , seeker . I only call myself " seeker " so others in the realm Will come to me when they want to find Ahamo . What ? It was your mother 's idea . What do you know about my mother ? Well , I know you look just like her . You got your passion and your grit from her ... Your artistic ability from me . You 're my father ? Yes , Dg . The one your mother calls Ahamo . I have been dreaming of this day , of seeing you again . Okay , so you 've seen me , so ... Give me whatever it is my mother sent me for , And I 'll be leaving your , uh , teepee . Like it or not , Dg , I 'm your father . No , no , I had a real father . He was a robot , but he was there for me . He was a good guy . That 's for kidnapping me ! And that 's for abandoning my mother ! And that 's for being a complete bastard ! Stop , Dg ! Stop ! Everything you think you know , you don 't . Now , let me explain - - explain what ? Oh , you 're a pistol , I 'll mive yo thatuch . Just like your mother . Just as lovely , too . Don 't play that fake lovey-dovey card with me . I don 't buy it for one second . My feelings as real as they get , Dg . Go on , it 's from your mother . It 's from my mother ? What is it ? It 'll lead you o the gray gale . And the emerald . Dg ... I know this is a lot for you to handle right now . All I ask is that you open your heart . Trust me . Can you ? We have a long way to go and not much time . But I can 't go anywhere without my friends . Dg , the eclipse is almost here , and you 're the O. Z. ' s only hope , Now , your friends understand how important this mission is . Help me turn it over . Get this out of our way . Sorry . Now ! Would you and your troops like a drink of water ? Father ... Son . It just keeps spinning . Maybe you 're just trying too hard . Clear your mind . Remember how it felt when you were a little girl , How the light flowed through you . Just concentrate , Deeg . Hey , did you see that ? Hey ... Hurry . Here , let me help you . Help me lift him off the cart . Grab the other side . Fetch some bandages . On three ... This way . Move ! What 's that doing here ? I keep it to remind me . To remind everyone . What we 're fighting for . You know , i , uh ... I thought you were dead . They told mother and I you were dead . If I knew you were still alive , I would have risked everything , Crossed enemy lines to come get you . You know that , don 't you ? Yeah , I do . Excuse me , sir . Sergeant is asking for you . Sir ? You , uh ... It just worked out like that . I 'm proud of you , son . Hey ... You all right ? Sure . When I took off from the nebraska state fair , I got caught in a freak storm And somehow slipped over to this side . It was a rough crossing , But when the clouds cleared , I was hovering over this crystal blue lake , And the most beautiful woman I 'd ever seen . My mother ? From that day on , I was hers . We married , two beautiful daughters . The perfect life . Until I messed it all up Letting the old witch escape . Your mother and I would given anything to keep that memory hidden from you . No . I have to know . Well , when your sister ... Killed you , When your mother gave you second life , We both knew something drastic had to be done , Both for the O. Z. and for you . That 's why I took you to the other side , Brought you to that tiny farmhouse . Why didn 't u stay ? Well , my job was here , To protect the secret of the emerald and prepare for u return . ? you and my mother could never be together ? There ! Azkadellia shield his mind . Raw cannot see . I 'll make this easy for you If you tell us everything you know about the machine . Bring it in . What do you got there ? What-what is that ? What , uh ... What , um ... Uh , what ... Are you , um ... O - okay , um ... Hold his fingers . No ... No ! No , wait , wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! No , not the fingers , not the ... Not the fingers - shut up ! I 'll tell you anything you want to know ! Oh , it 's too late . I 'll talk , okay ? - It 's too late ! Son ... Let him talk . Talk . The machine forms an intense beam of light . Why ? It focuses the power of the emerald at the double eclipse . Locks the two suns behind the moon . It 'll bring darkness to the O. Z. forever . Damn thing 's the anti-Sunseeder . Sunseeder ? Yeah , it 's a little doe I designed To slow the suns and extend the growing season . How do we shut it down ? - Ask him . Well , it soun wh 'sat she using it for is an entirely different barrel of monkeybats . I don 't know how her machine works . Part of you does ... Ambrose . - Ambrose ? Jeb ? Our spies found out " ambrose " is the code word for the brain that runs the machine . My marbe in the tower ? - Where are they ? Brain room . - Brain room , sub-level three . Look , i ... I 've told yourything that you need to know . Can you just ... Put that thing away . Just , put the thing away , okay ? Can you just ... Glad to . Jeb , what are you doing ? Job 's not done yet . Now we can finally finish this . Not like this . Put it away . This is the guy that killed mother . He destroyed your life and mine , and you want to let him live ? He deserves to die . - Yeah ! I won 't deny that , then what killiim won 'g back your mother ... And it won 't honor her memory either . I think that means we 're here . But i don 't see anything . Your mother told me about this place , but i never dreamed it would be so beautiful . Who 's buried here ? The ones whose blood runs through your veins , a royal succession that lead to you . And the oldest rests here . She was your greatest great grandmother . The original slipper . First to make it through to the O. Z. From the other side . Dorothy gale . You were named in her honor . The emerald is guarded by the gray gale . This you must do alone . I 've been waiting for you . You 're dorothy ? The emerald of the eclipse is in your hands now . Come on . Adora ! Adora ! No ! It won 't be long until the eclipse . We have to hurry . Dg , you are everything i had hoped you 'd be . I am so proud of you . " i 'm so proud of you . " my little girl . You 're everything i hoped you 'd be . " daddy ... You old romantic . - No ! Daddy ... I have missed you so much . What did you do to him ? He 's quite comfortable . You have something for me . Come on . You want to share your shiny new trinket with your big sister ? No ... You 're not my sister . It doesn 't look like much , does it ? But it has so much power . Green 's not your colour . I thought you were dead , little sister . Buried in the ground all these years . - You 're a ... No . It 's where you belonged . You look good in marble . Green marble . Make camp . We leave in an hour . What did you do ? If we stop azkadellia , we 'll be back for him in a few days . If not , he 'll be there a long time . I hope that 's justice enough for you . It 's not my first choice , but mother would approve . If you don 't have heart ... You have nothing . Oh , who am i kidding , this is all my fault . If i hadn 't thought of my machine in the first place , she never would have been able to twist it . Yeah . I 'm scared . I don 't know what to do . Are you sure you trying to find dg is the right thing ? She 's alive , i know she is . Someone in the realm has to know how to find the seeker . Dg is the key to bringing the witch down . Well , gods willing , i 'll see you at the tower then . Thank you . Okay , let 's move it , men . We don 't have much time . Don 't you look pretty . Good thing , ' cause i brought you a date . Is it really you ? I have dreamed of this day . Oh , i love you . Enough . Do you know how long i have waited to see that look on your face ? No phony smile , no brave front , just pure and utter shock . It may be the most honest gift you 've ever given me , mother . I am not your mother . Our daughter is really gone ? Both of your daughters are gone . Dg is dead ? Your little girl 's quest has ended as your royal line ends today , in darkness . Permanent darkness . Toto ! I can take you to dg . I know where she is . She 's in trouble . Clear your mind . Remember how it felt when you were a little girl . How the light flowed through you . Concentrate , dg . Show me how she spins without touching it . You okay ? Dg ... Do you have the emerald ? Where is it ? She 's got it , cain . Okay , let 's go . Of course . Why would it be easy ? Well , if you guys can blow the generators that power those turbines , we can sneak in the same way we escaped . I 'll send my best men down to lay charges . Kind of boggles the noggin to think we 're going in there with all guns blazing . Well , let 's hope we 're the quiet part of this plan . We 're almost ready . - Have you guys seen raw ? I , uh , think he 's lost his nerve . Hey , raw , i wanted to show you something . That 's bad , right ? I mean ... You lost the emerald , so ... W - what does that mean ? It means ... That i don 't need it anymore . All that i need is right here . Raw ... You are no coward . You have taught me that courage is not about being fearless , it 's about standing up in spite of your fear , and you stood up to the papays , you threw yourself off a cliff , you escaped from prison . Raw do that for dg . No . You did that for you . Courage has been in you all along . You know , when i had a brain , i was twice as scared as i am now with only half a brain , which means that if i had no brain at all , i would be four times braver than i was when i was brainy . Glitch ... You 're the smartest guy i know . No , you 're just saying that to make me feel good . You helped me remember my past , and that 's probably the most important weapon i have now . Thank you . I know what you 're doing , kid . I 've led men through battle myself . And , um , how am i doing ? There 's less hugging when i do it ... But not so bad . We better get going - look ... You may not be able to save your sister . So if our plan doesn 't work , you will try to get out of there ... Right ? This is the one time that i 'm not going to be there to help . You 've already helped me , mr . Cain . I 'm serious . Don 't go up there and lose you head , and ... Forget about what 's really important . What 's really important is family . I can 't remember who taught me that . Good luck , mr . Cain . I want no interruptions once it begins . After 500 years , i want this moment to be ... Perfect . Forward light pulse is at 100 % . All we need now is power . The west wall , quickly ! Move , move , move ! The resistance is giving me a fireworks display . You three with me . - Yes , sir ! Let it begin . What is it ? - Intruders . We 're doubling the guard . This way ! Let 's go . Raw , which way ? Up one floor . All right , let 's do it . Good luck . I thought you hightailed it . Go . I 'll watch out . Go . Hey , look . I 'd recognize me anywhere . Glitch ... - Hmm ? It 's time to get reacquainted with yourself . Connect him to it . All right , glitch , i need you to remember something for me . Glitch , can you hear me ? My name isn 't glitch . It 's ambrose . Okay , ambrose . I need you to remember how you designed the sunseeder , and how to shut it down . Do you see the keyboard numbers that control the light pulsing ? Yeah , about a million of them . Which ones do i turn off ? Proper shut-down sequencing to reverse light pulsing is imperative - okay , which numbers ? What 's causing the problem ? Power surging in the brain cortex . Some kind of synapse interference . Get kalm . You two , come with me . Azkadellia ! There 's still time to stop this ! Look up ! The power of the emerald is about to lock the eclipse in the sky and bring permanent darkness to the O. Z. A fierce new world is awakening . No ! Listen to me , my sister ! This is not what you want ! Remember who you are ! Your sister is dead . No . Ah , good . I think it 's working . Why are we losing power ? And the last number to reverse light pulsing ... Yeah . One more , and it will be your last . No ! Don 't fire your weapon in here ! Kalm , tell me what they did and how to fix it . Now ! Turn on ... 1666 ... 14 ... 2025 - shut him up ! One more number , kalm . I can 't find it ! I need the final number for full power ! Ah , good . Finally ... Permanent darkness . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take you no one ever knows ... do you remember that time at the cave when you remembered what all those symbols meant ? You were so smart . It 's the picture language of the ancients ... " your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble , " that 's what you said . You said " you veadntures have a of getting me into trouble . Do you rememberpinning do how we made it fly together ? " concentrate ... " just concentrate , deeg . And do you remember the bear ? How scary it was , and you stood up . You were so brave , it made me brave . Just hold my hand , deeg ! Nothing can hurt us if we stay together ! Hold my hand . Nothing can hurt us if we 're together . Take it . Take it ! Take my hand . I 'm sorry i let go , az . I 'm scared . I 'm here , and i 'll never run away again . Take my hand . You 're talking into the wind , girl . Take my hand . Not now ! Take my hand . Have the little bitch . I care not . For the heavens do my bidding ! The emerald ... Give me the emerald . Give me the emerald ! Hold on . I 'm not going anywhere . Leave him alone ! You never understood . All you people need is encouragement . Raw just need courage . Glitch ... Wake up . Come on , glitch , wake up . Hello . Do i know you ? Good morning , sweetheart . - Cain ! We need that last number to reverse the beam . Now , think . The number , ambrose . The number ! Is it my locker combination ? Come on ! My parents ' anniversary ? I can 't think ! I won 't let go . You can do this . I can 't think . - Feel . I - i can 't ... I can 't think . I know what to do . Hold on . If we can 't reverse the number , i 've got to shut it down . I 'm sorry , ambrose . No , no , wait ! Wait ... 1208 ! The queen 's birthday , of course . Commence the reverse pulsing ! She melted . My azkadellia ? - Mother ... Oh , is it really you ? The witch is gone . It 's over . Dg ! I thought i 'd never see you again . Welcome home . Thank you . That 's the O. Z. I remember . I 'm so glad to be home .

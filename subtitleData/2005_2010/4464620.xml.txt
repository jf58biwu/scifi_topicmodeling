 The last time Mark had a problem , he was away from home testifying in one of his cases . Why can 't you remember everything ? Because I was loaded , okay ? Before he turned around , the flash-forward ended . - So I don 't think he saw me . - His son 's your patient . My son 's condition makes him a little hard to read . Dylan 's autistic . You 're panicked over what might happen . But we 've gotta use these flash-forwards to our advantage . Hey , Mark . We got our funding . Mosaic 's still alive . Mark ? I know what caused the flash-forwards . You don 't believe me . Well , of course I do . The world 's greatest mystery 's been solved by a boozer on a train bound for Los Angeles . Can you connect to the internet with that ? Real quick , do an image search for " quantum physicist genius . " Go on . I 'll wait . Which popped up first ... Me winning the Robert Wilson award or the jaunty one of me holding lab goggles over my genitals ? Hold up . You really ... I 'm obviously wasting my time . I 'm sorry . I 've just heard that line a hundred times before . - You genuinely want to know ? - Of course . The flash-forwards were caused by you . It 's simple quantum mechanics , really . Whenever a heavenly body carries such an intense force of attraction , the universe just goes ... bananas . - Sounds technical . - Helps if you have a PhD or two . If my calculations are correct , your dark energy could bring about another catastrophe at any moment . Luckily , I 've pinpointed the one location on Earth that has an irresistible enough force to counteract you . Let me guess ... - Your sleeper car . - Grab your purse . We 've not a moment to lose . I thought for sure that would work . A 21-year-old sorority girl , maybe . But , um , I 've learned never to go anywhere unless I 'm gonna get the real thing . The actual cause ? Mm . I have a theory , but the , uh ... The science is a little complicated . I 'm a complicated girl . I can handle it . The most basic concept you need to understand is quantum superpositions . Are you aware of the double slit experiment ? Well , there was that one time in college ... - What about Schr√∂dinger 's cat ? - No , I 'm not that kinky . Close your eyes . Give me your hand . Okay . Now imagine you have a cat ... B.B.L. ' s a liter in the field and only one P.I.V. We need access here ! A teeny , tiny cat ... OLIVIA : What have we got ? MAN : We 've got a gunshot wound to the abdomen . We need to set up a peripheral . - Janis ? - We need access here ! That fits in the palm of your hand . You also have a poisonous sardine . Once we close your palm , there are two possible scenarios . OLIVIA : Bring the code cart . Come on , let 's go . Clear . Either the cat eats the sardine and dies , or the cat doesn 't eat the sardine and lives . - No response . - Going again . Quantum physics says until we open your hand to discover the cat 's fate , both eventualities occur at the same time . Clear . Still no response . C.P.R. For us , the cat is both living and deceased . WOMAN : But how can that be ? That 's the miracle of quantum mechanics ... The observer gets to decide . The kitty 's already made up its mind . Alive or dead ? See for yourself . " Scary Monsters and Super Creeps " WOMAN : Hemoglobin 's holding at 12 . BRYCE : Hallelujah . OLIVIA : Okay . Fascia 's closed . " O " silk on a driver to Dr. Varley . I 'm gonna be honest . A few hours ago , I didn 't think we 'd get this far . Close the skin . Let me know when she wakes up . This is Mark . Leave it here . I 'll get back to you . Hi . It 's me . Where are you ? I have been calling and calling . I tried Demetri and Stan . I just can 't get through . I tried the office , and they 're just stonewalling me . After this thing with Janis , I don 't know , I 'm worried . Can you just call me ? Please ? I love you . I love you . Ohh . Again , Daddy , again . You 're not bored with this one ? No ! Cards . Make the cards . Okay . I 'll turn around , and you choose . So , Dylan , you know it 's almost time for you to leave the hospital . We 're gonna go to Palo Alto . Which one ? Which one ? - Did you pick a card ? - Uh-huh . Okay , now look at it and remember . Okay ? Uh-huh . Okay . So now it 's just you and me . I was thinking that the best idea is you come and live in my house with me . No . Dylan . Cards . We all lived there before your mother and I ... I mean , you 'll have your own room . It 'll be great . - Cards ! - Please . I - I need you to go along with this . Uh ... Um , okay . Uh ... Is this your card ? It 's my house , too . Hey , buddy . Almost time for trick-or-treating . - That 's today ? - Yeah , it 's the 31st . It 's Halloween . - The kids go from room ... - Yeah , I know , I know . I just forgot to get him a costume . Um , I 'll be right back , okay ? Excuse me . Playing cards , bud ? It 's my house , too . How 's Janis ? Two uniformed cops outside her room . Only her doctor and FBI badges are allowed inside . Good work . No one will be able to get to her . But what about you guys ? Whoever it was that came after you last night , what 's to stop them from trying again ? Nothing . Hey . Hey ! Are you okay ? What happened ? Yeah , yeah . It 's nothing . It 's nothing . But you have blood on your shirt . Well , now listen . Listen . There 's a room full of FBI agents that need a doctor to tell ' em if Janis is gonna make it . - Oh . Okay . - All right . Okay . Okay , okay . Okay . - Hi . - Hey . We had her in surgery for five hours . The bullet did some damage , but there shouldn 't be - any lasting effects . - And ? And she 's in recovery . She 's sedated . We 'll know more when she wakes up . Olivia , you saved her life . Thank you . All right , everybody , it 's been a long night for all of us . It 'll be a while before we know anything more . The hospital doesn 't need us clogging things up . So I got your numbers . Get some rest . I 'll call you if I hear anything . You , too , Demetri . I 'm sorry , boss , no . I 'm either staying here to see her through , or I 'm going out and finding the people who did this to us . There are already two dozen agents working this who didn 't have a grenade launched at ' em last night . Now I 'm serious . Get outta here . And if it helps , consider it an order . Come on . You tired ? Well , Wedeck told us to go home . No . He said for us to get out of the hospital . - It 's a surface wound . Just leave it . - Are you kidding me ? I want to see what those D.C. doctors did . Oh , Livy , it 's nothing . Come on . You want to tell me what happened ? - You don 't ... - I want to know . We were attacked . Um , pretty bad firefight . Wedeck and Demetri killed two of them . The others escaped . It 's gotta be connected to the guys who came after Janis . Simultaneous attacks . Because you 're investigating the blackout ? Why would anyone want to kill you because of that ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Still trying to figure it all out . Oh , see ? I knew I shouldn 't have told you . No . No , it 's not that . It 's ... You know , when they brought Janis in , I couldn 't get ahold of you . My imagination just ran wild ... I mean , not knowing where you were , not knowing what was going on . It was horrible . But I 'm here , and I 'm okay , all right ? I 'm all right . We have just been so ... obsessed with what we saw , and with the future , with what might or might not happen . And it 's ... it 's a distraction . It 's just pulling us out of today , and today , right now this moment is all we have , babe . It 's all we have . I don 't want to miss it . Me neither . Yo . Hey , Dewey . How is she ? - A lot better than these guys . - Attagirl , Janis . Do you mind ? Got no I.D ... No cell phone , no keys . No fingerprints , no dental records . It 's just like our guys in the parking garage in D.C. We got nothing . Got nothing . Which means we 're dealing with real pros . What about , um , medical history , Dewey ? So far just one removed appendix here , one Achilles surgery there . I 'm checking for radial keratotomy scars as we speak . Hey , Demetri . Demetri . Yeah ? What ? You doing okay in here ? Yeah . Why ? You put yourself on Mosaic . You think there 's anybody in the office who doesn 't know by now ? But the point is , you just got shot at 12 hours ago . Now you 're standing in a morgue ... acting kind of weird . Listen , Al , you 've been acting kind of weird for a couple of weeks yourself , all right ? So , um , you want to talk about our feelings , or you want to get back to work ? Work sounds good . This guy 's right eye is covered with corneal scarring . No big surprise there . What assassin worth his salt doesn 't get LASIK ? Should practically be a union requirement . Wait . You see that ? Looks like a hand stamp from a bar . No , it 's a blue hand . It 's a clue from Mark 's board . Something about Baltimore ... A hand ... a blue hand . This son of a bitch is gonna be useful after all . That costume is super fly . It was the last thing they had left in his size . No , I like it . Really , it 's cool . Although he doesn 't seem to like this very much . Yeah , it 's hard to tell with him . I think he 's mad at me about the move . Oh , I was just wondering if in the next couple of days Dr. Benford might come by so we could , uh ... Yeah , say our good-byes . Yeah . Yeah , sure , I 'll let her know . Great , thanks . - Hey . - Hey . I 'm glad she 's okay . Yeah . It 's pretty scary stuff for all of us . Yeah . Listen , it 's been a rough week , and maybe I said some things that were out of line . Um ... Let 's take a deep breath and ... get back on track here , hmm ? Ohh . This only takes quarters . Mm-hmm . I got it . - There . - Thank you . We 're even now . The guys who came after you , the guys who shot Janis ... All Asian . Why don 't I head over to Huang 's office , see if blue hand has some special significance - in Cantonese or Mandarin ? - Mandarin ? Come on , man . According to the CIA , China might have caused the blackout . If they did , trying to blow up a team of federal agents seems a little showy , don 't you think ? Well , in their minds , I mean , it could be as simple as neutralizing a threat . Well , then why come after us ? The CIA agent who testified at the hearings yesterday is fine , but Mark talks about D. Gibbons , Suspect Zero , the crows , for the first time outside of this office , and then eight hours later , it 's ... China is a dead end . I don 't want blue hand to become one , too . OLIVIA : All right , do you know where you are ? I am in a hospital ? Very good . Do you know who I am ? No . But for some weird reason , I get the feeling that your husband is a little bit of a neat freak . I don 't know . Something about how he doesn 't like his black pens to touch his blue pens . - Does that sound familiar ? - Uh-huh . She 's back . You 're an amazing doctor . And an overworked one . I wish I could be with you guys tonight . Oh , we 'll take pictures . Can you make sure she doesn 't eat too much candy ? Sure . Just , like , a couple of pieces - or something . - Couple ? 20 . I 'll see what I can do . Bye . When Mark had you pin the blue hand card to the board , he knew it was somehow related to the word " Baltimore . " Yes , that 's what I 'm saying , Sparky . Okay , Baltimore Street is 5 miles away . Let 's go check it out . But you were attacked last night in D.C. so Baltimore , Maryland , is the better bet . Yeah , but the guy who had the blue hand stamp on him was in L.A. , all right ? Baltimore street is in Silver Lake . If I 'm wrong ... if I 'm wrong , we 've wasted an hour . What ? So you believe in these visions now ? It 's ... it 's complicated . No , I get it . I mean , if I hadn 't had a flash-forward , I 'd be doing everything I could to prove those visions weren 't true . Listen , if we had anything to go on at all here , any real-life lead whatsoever , believe me , I 'd be the first guy talking to ballistics or forensics or whatever , all right ? But we don 't . I just want to find the animals that are trying to kill us , and Baltimore Street is the only thing I can think of , all right ? So come on . I 'll buy you a pressed sandwich from the Cuban place . Sold . One hour . CHILDREN : Trick or treat ! WOMAN : Oh , yeah ! Oh no ! Super shark has Monkey-See and Monkey-Do in his helmet ! He 's trying to eat them ! - Daddy , that pulls . WOMAN : Happy Halloween ! - Just be still . I 've almost got it . - Pirates . I can 't believe you don 't have a costume . - You always have a costume . - I 've been a little busy lately . I can finish up with her if you want to get in your costume . Thanks , Nicole , but I 'm not wearing a costume . You could go as Tim-Tim 's dad , Jim-Tim . What does Tim-Tim 's dad look like ? Don 't say a word , Obi-Wan . - You 've got to be kidding me . - Whoa . Was that a kangaroo ? That is the best costume I have ever seen . Hey , got some milk from the nurses ' station to ... Dylan ? I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I seem to have lost my son . What 's he look like ? Uh , he 's about this big , uh , wearing , um ... Well ... well , a pimp 's outfit . I mean , I only turned my head for a second . Haven 't seen him , but there are tons of kids around . You might want to check the nurses ' station . Okay , thank you . Sir , you don 't have to stay here with me . I 'm sure after everything that happened last night , the office is chaotic . I 'm right where I need to be . I just feel really uncomfortable in this gown ... Yeah , I associate those crappy gowns with my wife delivering our son . After you 've seen a thing like that ... Was it awful ? Just the opposite . It 's ... primal . You feel like you 're there at the beginning of something ... miraculous ... A new life . You 'll see . - What 's that ? - That little monitor up there . Janis , I 'm sorry . We have to take you back to the O.R. Bring the type specific . - What 's wrong ? - Your blood count 's dropping . Beck , get her on a portable . - What ... what happened ? - I don 't know . Times Square . April 29th . The estimates on the Mosaic web site have us at half a million people already . The ball is gonna drop and everything . Half a million people going to their future . Mm-hmm . It 's a glorified New Year 's party . Do you have something better to do ? Yeah , you could say that . Who is she ? Oh , come on . I told you mine . He ... had a neck like an ox ... smelled like a meat locker ... What the hell were you guys doing ? I had my hands around his neck . I don 't know where I was or who the man was ... But I felt my thumbs press down on his trachea ... until something snapped . And then I let go ... Looked down at his lifeless body , quite satisfied . Aren 't you glad you asked ? I found this on the south exit camera . Yeah , that 's him . How long ago was this ? 17 minutes . Where could he be heed this time of night ? I have no idea . You getting on ? Mm-hmm . Then get on . Come on . We gotta go . Hey , kid , you gotta pay the fare ! Hey ! Hey , kid . You gotta pay the fare . Now do you have it or not ? Yo . Are you lost ? To our friends at 25696 Sawyer Court , Los Angeles , California , 90024 . What is he , brain damaged or something ? - Is he one of those ... - I 'm gonna put you down like a sick dog if you don 't shut up . - It 's my house , too . - That 's your house ? You know that address ? Yeah , and he 's gonna need a transfer . That 's $ 1.55 . Don 't worry , kid . Do you know any magic tricks ? No , mijo . I don 't do magic . You said an hour . It 's been over three . She 's back in surgery . - She 'll pull through . - Why ? She had a flash-forward , so she has a future ? WOMAN : 450 out , and she 's tachy in the 130s . What are we waiting for ? We only have one real option here . 5-0 Vicryl . With all due respect , Dr. Benford ... We 're gonna do a B-lynch . DEMETRI : Did I ever tell you about the night before she and I graduated from Quantico ? No . We 're at some dorm room getting hammered . I get us a beer . We finish . She gets us a couple more ... Then a couple of shots , and , uh , I 'm starting to worry that nerdy little girl 's gonna have to have her stomach pumped , right ? BRYCE : There 's no guarantee that a B-lynch will contain the bleeding . A b-lynch is a far less invasive procedure . Gives her a fighting chance of still having - a normal , healthy uterus . - Barely . DEMETRI : Next thing I know , it 's 4 : 00 A.M. I wake up on linoleum , got a foot in the toilet . I look over . Janis is at the kitchen table playing quarters against herself . Her insides are stronger than any bullet . - I 'll tell you that much . BRYCE : Be honest ... Would you be making the same decision if you didn 't know this patient personally ? 5-0 Vicryl . AL : Let me get this straight ... You blacked out after five drinks , and they let you keep your badge ? - That 's ... - You know why ? Because I 'm always right about everything . It 's like the hand on Mark 's board . CHILDREN : Trick or treat ! Hey , guys . Dig in , cowboy , princess . A very cool costume . And ? Hi . Um ? Hey ! It 's my house , too . You really should see a dentist . My parents couldn 't afford braces . Thanks for coming out tonight . I love Halloween . And , uh , I was worried about you . It 's good to see you out doing normal stuff . Yeah , I think it 's a good idea - for all of us to start ... - Let 's get going ! Okay . Paying a little bit more ... MARK : Watch her . Hey ! FBI ! Stop ! FBI ! Stay where you are ! Same hand , only this one 's missing some fingers . And , um , the other way . That was the orientation on our assailant . Am I crazy , or does it look like it 's pointing that way ? # Scary monsters # - # And super creeps # MARK : Stop right there ! FBI ! # Keep me running # # Running scared # # Scary monsters # # And super creeps # # Keep me running # # Running scared # Wasn 't my ... It wasn 't my idea ! I didn 't throw any eggs ! I just threw some toilet paper ! Where did you get this mask ? 99 cents store , man . You 're not gonna call my dad , are you ? Yeah , Nicole ? I 'll be right there . Makes sense . You run an underground club , you want to make sure only the right people find it . If the hand 's positioning is the direction , why the missing fingers ? The last hand had three fingers , right ? Right . We just drove three blocks . That 's it . Nice . I 'm sorry to bother you , but I tried Olivia first . - She 's in surgery . - You did the right thing . He came out of nowhere , and he had on this hospital bracelet that I was able to get off and call his dad . He 's on his way over . I 'm Mark . What 's your name ? My name is Dylan . My favorite book is " Harry Potter , " Prisoners of Azkaban . My dad does magic . Okay , um , Dylan , does your dad know you 're here ? This is my house , too . No , Dylan , this is my house , and I 'm trying to find out how you got here from the hospital . Go ahead . It 's your house , too . How do you know this address ? " To our friends at 25696 Sawyer Court , " Los Angeles , California , 90024 . " - Hey , Dylan ! - Hi , Charlie . Nuts to you , Squirrelio ! - Toot , toot ! - Toot , toot ! What was that ? It 's from the cartoon . Charlie , do you ... do you know Dylan from school ? No , he 's just my friend . What ? Excuse me . Hello . I think my son is here . NICOLE : Yeah , he 's right here . Come on in . Oh , my God . Are you all right ? Don 't worry , he seems fine . He just slipped out of the hospital . I - I can 't believe he 'd just wander off . Thank you for taking - such good care of him , uh , Mr ... - Sure . Benford . Mark Benford . - Right . - And I didn 't catch your name . Uh ... L-Lloyd Simcoe . Uh , uh , this is my son Dylan . Simcoe ? - Wait . - Benford ? Are you somehow related to Olivia ... Um , um , Dr. Benford ? I 'm her husband . Of ... of course . That ... that makes perfect sense ... Uh , your name being Benford , her name being Benford . Uh ... Trick or treat ! Oh . Hey , honey . You 're her . Not yet . - Um ... - You know , Charlie ... Why don 't we double check your candy in the kitchen ? Nicole , you want to come ? NICOLE : Good idea . What 's going on ? I thought you might know . Dylan came here . - Why ? - This is my house , too . It 's your house , too , Dylan . He keeps saying that . Dylan is autistic . - The repetitive speech ... - I don 't need a diagnosis . Now I understand . What ? Why I made her ... Why I made you so ... - Uncomfortable ? - Yes . Um , okay , clearly , um , this is an unusual situation . - No kidding . - Mark , don 't be like that . I can make this comfortable for everybody . You leave ... You don 't come back . I 'm very sorry if we 've caused you any inconvenience . Thank you ... Both ... for the kindness you 've shown Dylan . Thank you . It 's my house , too . - Okay . Come on . - Good night , Olivia . LLOYD : Come on , Dylan . Let 's go . Good night , Dylan . Looks like the party 's over . Definitely over . DEMETRI : FBI ! These came from a friend of yours named Maya ... " Worried about you . " You okay ? When I got shot ... the bullet ... bounced around all over the place . The only thing they said they could do without taking the whole thing out ... Olivia did this thing called a B-lynch . But with all the scarring ... They said that it 's gonna be almost impossible ... Why am I crying ? I never even wanted to have a baby . It 's gonna be all right . I can see why you like him . He 's very charming . I don 't like him . Come on . Can you stop so we can actually talk about this ? I don 't like him . He 's the father - of one of my patients . - I know who he is . What I want to know is how his son found his way here . I have no idea . - Really ? - Yeah . Well , I 'm a little confused , because I thought you said you had Dylan moved off your rotation . - I did . - You did ? Then why are you listed as the attending - on his wristband ? - Oh , God . I had nothing to do with that . My boss made the decision . Your boss also tell you not to say anything about it ? No , I didn 't say anything about it because I thought it would make a horrendous situation that much worse . Oh , so you thought hiding it was a better plan . That 's not what was going on , Mark . Don 't turn me into someone I 'm not . Well , don 't you turn this around and make it about me . The man you might be sleeping with in six months ' time was just in our living room , and I sure as hell didn 't bring him into our lives . You did ! That 's not fair . Just be honest . Just be honest . Have ... have you been talking to him at work ? Oh , come on ! Come on , Mark . Huh ? Have you done anything else I should know about ? Mark , don 't interrogate me . - Then be honest with me ! - I am ! Are you being honest with me ? Oh , what are you talking about ? All the old patterns are back , Mark . You 're out of the house all the time . You 're more and more secretive . So I 'm asking you the same thing that you asked me ... Be honest . Are you hiding anything from me ? Mark ? In my flash-forward ... I was drinking . Wow . Here we are again . Olivia , this isn 't like before . The lying 's already started . What ? No , it hasn 't . This isn 't the same . Don 't condemn me for something I haven 't done yet . Did you even hear what you just said ? You 've been punishing me this whole time for an imaginary relationship . But when it comes back to you , you want to be let off the hook . But our past together , Mark ... All we 've been through with your drinking ... That 's real . That still hurts . I 'm not going through it again . I promise you ... I 'm not gonna drink . But it 's not about the drinking . You know that . It 's about trust . It 's about trust , and we don 't trust each other anymore . So everything we said at the hospital today about only living in the moment , well ... All that was a lie ? It 's not a lie . It 's what I want . I just don 't know if it 's possible anymore ... Not now ... Not with us . Hey , Demetri ? Am I missing something ? I mean , on the same night our guy tries to kill Janis , he 's hanging out here ? I don 't know , but they found this on one of the bodies . Remember the Rutherford case ? We were talking about a case that I don 't think even exists yet ... The Rutherford case . It begins tonight . All right . It was quite a day , huh ? Is it gonna be Halloween again tomorrow ? No . Just today . Good , ' cause it was kind of scary . Yeah . Yes , it was . I 'll see you in the morning .

 Previously on bionic woman What is going on Jaime Just tell me , OK , I need know . I can`t What 's this ? Sudent ID . You 're going to college . - The transfer student from oxford . - The merciful T.A. Tom Gilchrist . Can I interest you in a tasty beverage ? I 'll be right back - Who are you ? - Who are you ? I asked you first . You 're frickin 'F . B. I , aren 't you ? You supposed to leave this to us . What ? Are you like a CIA agent ? - Well , what the hell are you ? - I 'm with the Berkut group . They 're making the drop . All right , I 'll go down . You stay up here and cover me . Don 't underestimate me . - You all right ? - Yeah . Not a good idea . What about you ? What 's your story ? It 's my last night at college . Can we just hang out ? $ 250,000 cash . Walking around money . Five million in bearer bonds . As requested . I 've done my part . Where 's the list ? Right , the list . Move move move ! hurry move move move ! This one 's still alive . Get the chopper down . I want him alive and brought to berkut . Bring it in . Copy that . He is ? Okay , excellent . Wait , did you mention me ? What did he say ? Really ? Shut up . Yeah , tonight at 8 : 00 . Okay , all right , see you then . Guess who 's coming over tonight for tarantino movie night ? - Brennan . - Brennan . - Actually , I think I 'm gonna call him . - No , you are not calling him . Rule number one , let him call you . Rule number one ? Come on . There are a list of rules , and they are ironclad . Oh , the list of rules . Okay , I cannot believe you read that book . It is seriously anti-feminist . I 'm just saying calling a guy is the kiss of death . Even if you thought you spent an incredible , meaningful night with somebody , and they follow that up with eight days of stone cold silence . What are you talking about ? The rules . Let him take the lead . Rule five . Be mysterious . Rule six . And don 't ever split the check . Rule ten . I mean , am I allowed to vote our own property ? I 'm trusting you and your friends to have a good night , okay ? No smoking , no drinking , no driving . And more importantly , no calling brennan . Okay , you are seriously way behind the times you should have a word with him . I understand you worked for Victor Booth . I also understand ... you have a wife , children . The last thing you would want is for something to happen to them . What 'd you find out ? The sale is set up at the sahrawi embassy in paris . Put a team together . This is the last known photograph of Victor Booth . Who 's Victor Booth ? He 's an arms dealer , among other things . Doesn 't seem to have any permanent address . Multiple reconstructive surgeries . Uses decoys . Doesn 't get photographed , so nobody knows what he looks like . That image is eight years old . The only thing about it is we can see the eyes . What does Berkut want with him ? Killed one of my men last night . Our operative was set up as a buyer for a list we really need . Somehow victor got wind of the fact that he was berkut . He killed him and left the cash . Which was smart , ' cause the bills were traceable . We 've since learned he 's set up another buyer . Learned from who ? The CIA . I thought CIA and Berkut hated each other . We do , but in this case , we 're forced to work together . We need victor 's list . What 's on the list ? The identities of CIA and Berkut operatives . Now , intel says Victor 's on his way to Paris . Given the nature of the situation , CIA 's gonna insist that we send somebody in there with you . So I 'm going to paris with a CIA agent . - That 's right . - Can I pick who ? This isn 't a kickball game , Jaime . I just thought that , you know , since time is of the essence , it 'd be good to skip the getting to know you part and just hit the ground running . Tom Gilchrist and I seemed to get the job done last week . Okay , you wanna call him ? No , you go ahead . I don 't call guys . You 're missing the point , jaime . Really ? ' cause I think I just kicked your ass . Discretion . You have to be able to neutralize the enemy in public without anyone ever seeing . Once you 're exposed to the world , you 'll lose all value as a weapon . You know what I love most ? Being referred to as a weapon . You all right ? hi . - Tom . - Jae . Good luck . Long time . Nine days . So you ready for paris ? Yep . By the way , thanks for calling me out in this . Oh , I didn 't call you . Jonas called you . Okay , so here 's the plan . When we land in De Gaulle , we gotta move fast . Oh , De Gaulle , ha ha . I hate Paris . If I 'm being honest , I just ... I don 't get the allure . I 've never been . You haven 't ? Oh , It 's the most romantic place in the world . You 're gonna love it . - Really . - Yeah , romantic . My parents took me there when I was 12 . 15 churches and five museums in one day . Gun , mouth . The Louvre , don 't do it to yourself . - Can we concentrate on the case ? - Let 's get down to it . All right , Jae , you and I will take Nathan to the safe house and we 'll set up shop with the rest of the CIA team . Meanwhile , you 're gonna assume your cover and check into the hotel . How did Berkut find Victor ? Last week , one of our top operatives made contact . He was killed trying to buy the list . Victor means business . He sold names before . The three operatives on the last list were all dead 48 hours after it was sold . And if our intel is correct , there 's over 100 names on this list . Which means we 're talking about not only american security , but the immediate safetyof over 100 men and women and their families . So if we can get those names , we can protect those people . So is the sale definitely going down tonight ? The one thing that we know for sure is it 's happening tonight . And we need to get a positive id on victor from among 200 to 300 guests . So you two have to eye make contact as many eurotrash toolbags as you can . And we 'll take care of the rest at the safehouse . Bring victor into custody and we keep the list from getting into enemy hands . Let 's go do it . Sounds good . Hey , let 's keep it professional , you two , huh ? you ever seen breathless ? - Jean-luc Goddard ? - No . I bet you haven 't seen a single movie made before 1983 . The breakfast club ? Thanks for playing . We have some lovely parting gifts . We need two rooms . - I was in turkmenistan ... - I didn 't know you spoke french . - No , no , you go ahead . - That 's why I didn 't call . Bad service ? Who 's your carrier ? I know . It sounds lame , doesn 't it ? No , no , it sounds really important . Well , it was important . But you understand that , right ? Saving lives , national security , that kind of thing . I mean , you 're in the game too , right ? Sure . I gather I 'm madame lodato . Does that make me your wife or your mom ? My very chic wife . I 'm a lucky man . Oh , I almost forgot . You all right ? Yep . Look at the view ! Yeah , it 's great , right ? Well , since we 're a married couple , we should just watch tv and not have sex . That 's a great idea . I wonder if they have deal or no deal . Say it in french . Um , you know ... You don 't have to worry . I 'll ... I 'll just ... I 'll sleep on the couch . I think that 's a better idea . Bonjour , mi ami . What 's up , Jae ! - Comment c 'est va , everybody ? - Nathan . Wow , they 're not very friendly . This the french CIA ? Wait till you meet their handler . All right , I installed the iris recognition software I got from my friend at ... Oh , wait , I can 't tell you where I got it , because then ... No , don 't say ... - I have to kill you ... - Because then you have to kill me . All I need to know is whether this will effectively identify victor . Jaime needs to lock on to peoples 'eyes . Once she does , the program converts the details of the iris stromal pattern into a bit pattern , and I can cross-reference . Once I affirm the match , I apprise agent summers so that she can determine the means to extricate the mark to the jimjam . You realize that spies don 't really talk that way . I know . It blows . I 'm just trying to bring back the cool . Anyway , if jaime meets victor 's eyes , we 'll find him . Victor 's altered his appearance numerous times . Even if victor has gone victoria , the program is airtight . Okay , this biometric technology makes photoshop look like pong . Unprecedented false rate match . Like , never . Even these geniuses can 't change their eyes . Wouldn 't be so sure about that . Alexis . Ruth . Nice work in Dubai . Where 'd you find your floater ? High school sweetheart . Jaime summers , that 's a new name . How long has she been ... What is she , 12 ? How did you find her ? Happy accident . Iris recognition . I doubt your operative can get 200 captures during the cocktail party . I don 't know , our girl is pretty good . Dude , don 't ... Don 't touch my stuff . There 's a lot of security , but we knew that . Yeah , packing semiautomatics outside the embassy is a pretty big deal . If they 're doing that . Are they ? They are . So what 's the embassy party for , anyway ? Environmentalists . I didn 't know environmentalists liked to party . Hey , if we I.D. Victor before 8 : 00 , croissants on me . It 's gonna be more complicated than that . I know . Just trying to lighten the mood . Jeez . Jaime ... I have to go out in the field with a clear head . If I lose focus for a second , I 'm dead . Now , I can handle that responsibility if it 's just about me . But I can 't even begin to think about screwing up and , as a result , you ... Personal relationships can compromise a mission ... I get it . I do . I like you . I really do . Look , I think we should just be friends . Good . Good . - We haven 't even had a second date . - Exactly . It 's gonna be fine . Just partners executing a job . That 's right . I thought you guys said that brennan was gonna call . 'cause he didn 't . That 's a bad sign , right ? Calm down . He 's coming over . You guys 'll hang out , we 'll watch reservoir dogs , and you two 'll hook up . The end . No , no , I don 't really wanna hook up during reservoir dogs . Okay , I guess I can make that work . Hey , becca . This is my friend annie . Hi , rebecca . It 's becca . Annie didn 't even know who quentin tarantino was . Oh , shut up . Sorry , excuse me . Hopefully the receiving line 's still happening . That way we can split up and cover more ground . Victor could look like anyone , so we have ... Could you zip me up ? The drop needs to happen by 9 : 45 . We 've got to id victor before then . Security at 3 : 00 and 9 : 00 . Surveillance cameras in the grandfather clock and ugly flower arrangements . - Okay , how are you getting that ? - Oh , come on . What did those guys teach you at langley , anyway ? Possible target id , northwest corner . Funny , I would have said by the buffet . Shut up . Perhaps we can debate lithuanian tariffs another time . Mrs. Varnas is in basle tonight . Not our guy . He 's about to leave with her and it 's not even 9 : 00 yet . Okay . God . What do these euro douches have over me ? Wealth , power , dignity . No match . Plenty of targets , let 's look around . Him ? No No way , what 's this guy , shaolin monks here . This is a great party . Why am I not there ? By the bar . Nope . No , look at his hands . They 're in the broken zipper position . Low and in front of the waist . The sign of defensiveness . Everything we have on our guy says he 's a sociopath . Cool And confident . Okay . Fernando ! Is that you ? May I help you , senorita ? That 's so good . He looks like a fernando . Not him , let 's go . No match . Sorry , I mistook you for somebody else . And it 's senora . Now ... He could be our man . He 's not a diplomat , his shoes aren 't shined , he 's not wearing a cummerbund , and his jacket 's one size too big . Tom , you 're an ana ... You psychoanalyze people . Neurosurgeon , and you 're a therapist . We 're running out of time . Drinking , why not ? Let 's drink now . This is what we do at work . Do you know you 're at work ? What about him ? Yeah , how about , yeah , colonel sanders over here ? He looks good . That 's a rare vintage in this town . Only thing I order when I 'm in paris . Drives the french nuts . So I take it you 're not from paris . No , I just couriered a package over here this morning . Got roped into this little get-together . It 's a rental . Catch his eye . C 'est la vie . Come on , look her in the eye , come on . I 'm based in D.C. And , you ? I 'm a professor at stanford , and my husband is an art historian doing research at the picasso museum . No , I 'm here for the van gogh retrospectives , actually . She 's a beautiful lady . Come on ! What are you doing ? He 's looking at everything but your eyes . Come on , casino royale . I 'm shaken and I 'm stirred , okay ? Come on . What 's your favorite picasso ? My favorite ? Well , no , I 'm focused mainly on the impressionists . But as an art historian , you must have at least a passing interest in picasso . - I like the blue period . - Yeah , blue period rocks . Favorite , dora maar au chat . You know it ? No , I don 't . You 'd know it if you saw it . Look , when I was dropping off this package this morning , There was this piece in the secretary 's office . A picasso . But I can 't tell if it 's an original . Maybe you could , take a look at it for me ? Well , maybe later . We just got here . Honey , let 's see it . Maybe it 's one you don 't know . Attagirl . That 's what i 'm talking about . It 's close , just one flight down . Right up your alley . Thank you . Thanks . I 've got a hunch . - What are you doing ? - Just go with it . All right , there we go . Come on , we gotta get a clear shot of his eyes . Let 's do this . Right through here . First door on the left . Yes , finally . We have a match . That 's him . That 's victor . See ya . Come on ! I know it 's him . We lost him . How ? He locked us in a wine vault . Getting locked in a wine vault is a cliche . And do I need to remind you that you 're bionic ? Yeah , I know , I 'm on it . I 'll call you back . Let me help . - You 've been such a great help so far . - Pardon me ? Let 's go see that picasso . Maybe it 's one you don 't know . Everyone knows that 's picasso 's most famous painting . Everyone . You 're the one who went down picasso road . I was briefed in van gogh . Then you 're like , let 's just do down into this dark basement - with a strange man . - Anybody can be surprised . - It 's embarrassing is what it is . - Ass ! You know , the buy is happening now . Can we just try this together ? What do you weigh , a buck ten ? That 'll make a huge difference . We 'll see . Whatever . Thanks . But I loosened it . Whatever . Come on . Did you see that ? See what ? Work with me . Excuse me . The only place we could find a little privacy . I need you now to turn around and go up the stairs ? How much am I gonna have to pay you to look the other way ? - You know , I was gonna do that . - Sorry . That 's all right . Nice technique . Thank you . Let 's go . - I 'm just gonna go - What ? - Gonna go . - Becca ... Look , I 'm fine , okay ? It 's fine . Jerk ! License and registration . You 're late . - All right , I 'm going in alone . - You 're kidding ? I know you can handle yourself , but this guy 's gonna be armed . You 're not ready for this . Victor 's in that room . That 's the mission . We both have to go in there . It 's too dangerous . We both knew it was dangerous before we came to Paris . - Nothing 's changed . - Yes , it has ! So I 'm your trophy spy . Come on ! This is harder than I thought . Just hang back . You don 't get to corner the market on brave . We both have to go . You think you 're being a gentleman , but it 's condescending . Get over yourself . I 'll take him . - You okay ? - Yeah . sClear . There 's nothing on him . No list . It 's not Victor . It looks like him , but it 's not him . Go , now . Wait , we have to go back for Tom ! There 's no time . Where is Victor ? We had a lock . It 's not my fault she takes out a whole new guy . Why hasn 't Tom called ? Trying to locate his tracking device . It says he 's still at the embassy , the GPS could have been knocked loose , left behind . He 's still there . We have to go back and just go in . Hello ? It 's sovereign territory . Just going in is not an option . Where did she come from ? You cost me quite a lot of money tonight . Who do you work for ? The Metropolitan Museum of Art . Really ? The only reason you 're not dead yet is ... I forgot . Can I talk to Tom ? Tom , it 's for you . I can 't believe you called me . Shut up . Are you okay ? Honey , everything 's fine . You know how much I love to hang out with the guys . Don 't worry , I 'm gonna be fine . Let me guess , you want your husband back . This is the wife , right ? Good for you . You want him back . I 'm afraid it 's gonna cost you quite a lot . I do want him back . And I also want the list . The list , really ? Really . $ 6 million . Fine . 2 million for your husband . Great . One hour . Go to the cafe Sartre at the Clignancourt . 3 % in cash , the rest in bearer bonds . If I see you with anyone else , I 'll cut your fake husband into real pieces . Does Tom have Victor ? Reverse that . We can get Tom and the list for 8 million . The drop 's in 58 minutes . What makes you think I can get $ 8 million in less than an hour ? You can 't ? I 'm not authorized to release that amount . Can you call someone who is ? - Is that a yes ? - Give me a minute . Whatever . We still have 57 of ' em . Can you get the money ? I know someone who can . Can you get me $ 8 million in , say , 45 minutes ? Thank you . It 's for the mission , right ? No , I found this great pair of shoes . You know , being flip doesn 't engender my trust . It 's to buy the list . I 'll authorize the wire . Nathan knows the account . Thank you . Just get it done . Wait , you 're Jaime 's boss ? Sorry , she said I should call you if there was an emergency . Driving without a license underage and intoxicated , I 'd say that qualifies . Well , thanks for your help , but I 'm just gonna go call one of my friends ... I 'm responsible for getting you home . On the way , we can have a little chat . - We can 't go in after Tom . - What ? We 're not authorized to do anymore here . My hands are tied . Your agent 's life 's on the line , and that 's your response ? This is a ghost mission now . Tom is solely accountable . He knows that 's how it works . He wouldn 't want us to put other agents lives in jeopardy . He 's compromised , Jaime . What would you say if I told you I 'm gonna go in and get him ? I 'd say good for you . Who 's gonna have my back in there ? We 're gonna be with you every step of the way , okay ? Are we good ? Absolutely . You have a mic and earwig . We can talk to you , you can talk to us . I don 't like you in the market alone . I won 't be alone . You and Jae 'll be covering me . You just can 't be with me . It 's too dangerous to Tom . Jaime , Berkut is allowing you to carry $ 8 million to get the list . Not to hang out with your boyfriend . I have a degree in psychology . Quit playing with that ring . There isn 't time to reinvent the plan . The list is the only reason we 're here . She can do it . $ 240,000 in cash . The rest in bearer bonds . You good ? Drop me here . So I 'm supposed to believe my sister 's selling time-shares ? What are the most popular time-shares ? I 'd have to say Arizona . No , it 's too hot . Old people like that . I mean , what is my sister doing selling them ? If I had to guess , I 'd say she 's trying to earn a decent living so she can take care of you . Great . I realize why she wanted me to call you . It 's , like , a guilt trip once removed . Sorry , I didn 't mean to lay a guilt trip on ya . I have a daughter , she 's accused me of that . She 's probably right , so I apologize . It 's okay . I 'm not into Jaime 's list of secrets , you know ? It 's like some things she just ... puts on this repeat loop . And then others she totally clams up about . I mean , we 're sisters . Like ... Okay , her fiancé ? She never talks about him . And he died . I mean , that 's weird , right ? We 're family , we should be able to talk about that stuff . Yeah , you should . Are you gonna say " Maybe she has her reasons " ? Maybe she does , you know ? Just keep walking to the center of the cafe . Fine , but I want you to ... Damn it . Hey , pretty lady . Care to join me ? Here we are , second date . Not a cheap one . How much ? - $ 8 million . - God . I don 't mind saying I expect you to put out . That 's very forward of you . You must be american . That looks nice on you . Don 't worry about it . It 's a cubic zirconia . No , it 's not . Okay , it 's not . - I do have an expense account . - So it 's a write-off . Now you 're making me sound like I 'm not romantic . I shouldn 't have said any of that stuff on the roof . - No , Tom , I was way out of line . - It was complete crap . I didn 't mean what I said at the embassy . - About me being condescending ? - Any of it . I shouldn 't have said that stuff . You can kick some ass . - I can . - You can . God , you 're beautiful . You realize that the minute that you put the money on the table , - we 're dead , right ? - Right . And if you didn 't bring any money , we 're also dead ? You read comic books as a kid ? I did . I loved ' em . My favorite was this one called Freedom Fighters . There was this great character called The Human Bomb . My God . Bombs , no . Nobody said bombs . Great . You want an espresso ? Good evening , I 've got a list of specials . Bingo , we got it . Pay dirt . Actually , I 'm not that hungry . Cafe policy , mademoiselle . You cannot sit at the table without paying . I can pay . Good . Get away from me ! - How do I deactivate it ? - You can 't . Now let me check the manual . Can I look ? Give me two seconds . No . It 's a solar fuse detonator . One of the leads is hot and the other two are decoys ! Pull the wrong lead ... - Are you sure ? - Yeah . It 's the ... Black wire . I 'm sure . Yank that puppy . Wait ! Wait ! Yank it ! Lucky guess . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . Holy ... All right . Stay out of the open . Watch out ! Watch out ! Watch out ! Where the hell did you come from ? How the hell 'd you get here ? I 'm a really fast runner . So they recovered about $ 4 million . The rest is working it 's way into the french economy . Well , I was actually carrying $ 8 million . So in a way , I got the list for half price . Listen . Don 't just call me for money . Call for backup . This time we came out ahead . - Could 've done better . - I was thinking about Tom . I was thinking about you . - What about the CIA ? - What about ' em ? - You give ' em Victor ? - Yeah . But they left Tom . They abandoned him . Frankly , Victor 's a lot better off with the CIA . By the way , my sister didn 't call , did she ? I gave her your number . How did you get to Victor before I did ? And ... How did you figure out the explosive device ? Don 't tell me you guessed , please . - I didn 't guess , I ... - What ? I don 't know how to tell you how I did it . The time you were working on the wiring , I should 've been scared for my life . But actually I was just thinking about how nice your hair smells . - Okay . You know what ? - What ? I will not wait eight days again for you to call me . You 've got one more shot at this thing . Two strikes and you 're out . Rule 27 . Hey , how about dinner ? I mean , we 're in Paris and all . I 'd love to , but I have to get back to my sister . No dinner the same day you save a guy 's life . Is that rule # 26 ? That 's not a rule . That 's just me needing to see my sister . I 'll call you . Hello ! You here ? I thought you weren 't coming back till 7 : 00 . What are you doing that you shouldn 't be ? If you tell me first before I find out , I might not freak . I 'm not doing anything . Come here . Sure this isn 't a diversion to get your guy Brennan out a window ? Please . Brennan is yesterday 's drama . It 's warm . I put it in the dryer . I 'm so sorry I assumed you did something bad . You know , I worry about you so much when I 'm away . And I worry about whether I 'm doing the right thing . And I 'm just so tired . I know what you 're giving up for me . For us . I am exactly where I want to be right now , okay ? Go take a bath . I think I will . Thank you .

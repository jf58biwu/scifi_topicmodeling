 Metronome Films Telekino Studio with the support of the Federal Agency for Cinematography of Russia An Arsen Gottlieb production A film by Nikolay Khomeriki NINE SEVEN SEVEN How long do I have to wait ? You 've just come . Don 't get rough with me . They 're waiting for me ! Nobody 's waiting for you here . Go down the alley , there 's a grey building , number 2 . Go up to the third floor . Room 108 . Ask for Sergey Sergeyevich . - Thanks . - Not at all . I 'm looking for Sergey Sergeyevich Hello . Sergey Sergeyevich ... is dead . What do you mean ? His wife put poison in his soup . - Stop it , Sergey Sergeyevich ! - What ? So it 's you who asked to come here all the way from Novosibirsk ? Yes . Any relatives in the town ? Nope . So where shall we settle you ? At the barrier ... There 's a washbasin . We 'll put a bed in for you . Do you like cucumbers ? Yes ... I 've always liked them . Thanks . Tamara ... Give me a hand . Hold that . - Careful ! - That 's what music does . And love . What 's the barrier ? Go on . I 'm going . I feel dizzy . Careful ! - Hello there . - Hello . I know why you came here . Come here . Be careful ! I have to pass ! Yes ... Yes , go on , Arkady Ilyich , I 'm listening . For today we 've got Kononov and Timofeyeva . As for Grinyov , there are some changes . Mikhail Ivanovich will compute it . I 'll make my report on Friday . So there are some changes , some changes ... Changes are fine , of course ... but have we no shame ? We work with human beings . I couldn 't sleep all night . I was thinking ... maybe we should wait a little ... but I 'm afraid that ... this coming check-up leaves me no time for reflection . I am sorry , but it doesn 't leave me any time for reflection . So , to those of you who haven 't met him yet , let me introduce ... Tishkov Ivan Dmitrich . Hello . He 's from Novosibirsk and is writing his thesis . I 've read his work . Sit down , please . Hope he didn 't come here by chance . So , from this day on , Ivan Dmitrich is going to be in charge of the work of Department 7 . So , please , Arkady Ilyich , help him to start as soon as possible Good bye . Good bye . You know ... I 've always dreamed of playing the piano . So , why didn 't you learn it ? The procedure has started . We 'll have the results in 20 or 30 seconds . Our object is in a sealed box . We irradiate him a bit and we discover that around him is a particle flux of unknown nature . We can see the outline and , with the help of this unique device , measure the force of this flux . What is amazing about it is that every person has a strictly individual force of flux . As you know , we are trying to influence it to understand its nature . Let 's look at Valery Ivanovich . 270 . Always the same : morning , evening , before or after a meal , even instead of it , before gym or after , it 's always 270 . Hello . - Why are you here ? - Well ... Well , we don 't need you today . You did your job yesterday . - OK , so we 'll go then . - Bye . Look at the twins . They were born at the same time but the force of their flux is different . Stop talking . I just wanted to brief him . Valery Ivanovich , how are you feeling ? Thank you . Please , open the box . All our guinea-pigs live here and swore in writing not to leave . They 're all volunteers . We try to consider all the factors to understand what causes a change in the flux force . What ? Am I OK to go to space ? Yes , you are . Thank you , you can go . - I could do it again . - No , thank you . That 's enough . As you wish . # Along the dusty roads , distant planets ... # Ivan , I read your latest article in " Biophysics " about the hypothesis that the ultimate force of this flux amounts to 977 . Interesting logic . I liked it . Thank you , Mikhail Ivanovich . Now what , Arkady Ilyich ? Now there 's meat and spaghetti and dried fruit tea . Dried fruits ... Got any matches ? OK . # Tidied away in their case , the maps of the sky ... # Get acquainted . Hello , I 'm Ivan Dmitrich . - Valera . - Hello . Timofeich . Gosha . The old man is a hooligan . Gosha is always reading or sleeping . As for Valera ... He is enthuasiast . It 's been a long time they are here , so we get used to each other . - Hello . - He 's so calm . Ginger , put your socks off . The women 's part is other side . I 've got it all ready for you . Come , Klavdia Ivanovna . Dammit ! Rita ! So , what is it ? Dunno , it 's not clear . OK , come down . - You heard it ? - What ? Some woman 's voice . It 's the radio on the 3rd floor . The kitten put its paw into the ink of blue and neatly wrote : " Tonya , happy birthday to you ! " Be a happy woman ! Girls , drink less . Champaign is not vodka . It is nice to drink . - Why aren 't you drinking ? - I don 't drink . Where are you going ? I 've got my secret . Here . To Antonina . Take this . I 've got something else . Thank you . I 'll hide it . Kolya , wait . What I want to say is , I feel like having a real party ! It 's Antonina 's birthday . I feel like ... having some real fun . My name 's Ivan . OK , Ivan . Look , Ivan . If you like ... If you like , tonight ... I 'll get you a chick . Any chick you want . Svetka , Tomka . Whoever you like . I can get you everything ! Valery Ivanich ... I respect you a lot . But please don 't . I mean it . I am asking you not to do that . OK . I said it just for fun ... Be right back . Stay here . I 'll be back . I 'll be right back . Join us . Come on , come on ! Give me a glass . Quick ! It 's Antonina 's birthday and we must celebrate . Bottoms up ! Where are you going ? Stay . Any equation , any formula has a corresponding curve or a body . For irrational formulas , such as the square root of minus 1 , we don 't know such bodies or we have never seen them . It doesn 't mean they don 't exist . But if we haven 't seen them , then they have a dimension of their own . Mathematics never lies . I want to go home . And who 's home ? Ivan Dmitrievich , what are you doing here ? Nothing , Sonya , everything 's fine . The device is still on . We are obsessed about this threshold value of 9.7.7 ... while everybody 's having fun . Hey ! I told you they were here . Everybody 's waiting for you . Valera , you have something there . I have ! That 's not what I mean . Something important . Inside of you ... What do you mean ? A soul ? Sonya , we are scientists . Something which can ... What ? Hey , you can hardly stand . Gosha , can I ask you to go into the box ? Sonya , help him . Arkady Ilyich couldn 't make it . I will . I 've got a suggestion ... What are they doing ? Sonya , come on , I 'm waiting ! Excuse me . Gosha , I 'm going to ask you a question . Answer it as sincere as possible . Just between us , OK ? Gosha , have you ever loved anybody ? Your parents , for instance ? No . Gosha , give it some thought . Take your time . Think . I am thinking . Sharik ! Gosha , what Sharik ? I used to have a dog called Sharik . Ah , Sharik ... Go on , go on ! It 's going up ! Carry on ! Still the same . Hello . How are you ? Fine . Is the food OK ? It 's OK . - How are you ? - Well . - How 's the dacha ? - Excellent . Let 's go home . No . OK , bye . Bye . Nice perfume . Has she gone ? Yes . So ? Nothing . Can I sit here ? If you like . It works . I have to give it back to Timofeich . He asked me to fix it . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I left you some meat in your bedside table . Meat ? I cooked it yesterday . What for ? You 've got beautiful hands . You know ... I looked through the books . There 's nothing but formulas . Not a single normal book . There 's piles of magazines . Same thing : nothing but formulas . Neutrons , protons , quanta ... You 're still looking for an answer , aren 't you ? I 'm scared . Bull shit ! That 's stupid ! Tell me , Tamara ... Do you think I 'll make it ? Pass me the basin . And you ... Do you believe in what you are doing ? Bring the basin back . Are you spying on me ? My head 's splitting . Shut the door . When I was at school , I used to go to the choir . Go in , please . I 'll tell you in there . So , I used to go to this school choir . There was this teacher called Tatyana Valentinovna . I liked her a lot . I used to be a soloist and I sang a song ... Don 't worry , she was old . No inquiry will find anything out . Heart failure , that 's all . Why have we been stuck in here all day ? Let 's go play soccer . Everybody used to listen to music . Now they all play soccer . Or ask me for advice if you break something . I 'm a pro . We could drool over the new intern . Leave me alone . I said , go away ! Ivan Dmitrich ... Come here a minute . Please forgive me . But there 's one thing I don 't get . I can 't understand it . I 've run this institute for 20 years . For 20 years , nothing like this ever happened . It 's your department , you 're in charge of your team . She had a heart problem . A very serious one . But you had some party there ! A real orgy ! I don 't understand ! I don 't understand how it happened ! I 'm sorry , it 's my fault . What 's the use of being sorry ? Who broke the piano ? - I did ... - Enough ! Stop lying to me . He broke the piano , of course ! Was Tamara there too ? God ... You have to sign it , Evgeny Grigoryevich . Alright . OK , that 's it . He must have had about 800 roentgens . But he 's quite optimistic . That 's a special case . We transplanted the spleen and bone marrow from a healthy dog . That 's the control animal . He 's bound to die . If we take Jack , there 's a chance . For dogs . Only dogs have been operated on so far . With varying success . Look , Gusev , be honest , just between us , how many roentgens have you had ? 200 . - Had it happened before ? - No . You 're lying , but I can 't catch you out . What 's the point ? It didn 't count in those days , but I feel ... Don 't trust your feelings . Look here , patient Gusev , do you think that 's your model ? No , that one ! Evgeny Grigoryevich , it 's rude of you to compare me to a dog . I 'd rather be rude now . You can live and work for many years - on one condition : no more risks and no more neutrons ! You know , radiation ... Sonya ... Please calm down ... It was raining last night . I couldn 't help crying . I don 't like it here . Let 's go , shall we ? You 're not listening . Reached the threshold value ? I 'm glad Sergey put his foot in it ! It 'll teach him a lesson . Under me , there 'd been no problems in 2 years . A peasant replaces me . Then , there 's one old woman less , parties ... Tamara is seen leaving his room ! What a waste of money ! They 'll shut us down . He shouldn 't have touched Tamara . They can shut us down . I 'll show Sergey Sergeyevich ! I 'll get so much money , he 'll crawl to me like a worm . And Tamara is ready to sleep with everybody . Except Sergey Sergeyevich . Except Sergey Sergeyevich . She didn 't refuse me either . The trees are beautiful . They 're old . The doctors say ... What do they say ? They say that it 's her age . Yeah . Nothing serious . In fact , they 're just panicking . Why not go to the rest home ? We hadn 't thought of that . Why not ? She thinks her medicine can help her . - Mikhail Ivanovich ... - Sergey Sergeyevich . Problem ? A meeting . - A meeting ? When ? - In half an hour . Half an hour ... I see , I see ... Say hello to Klavochka . Of course . Tell her to take care . Certainly . Thank you . They need a net ! Yes , a net .. - Mikhail Ivanovich ! - Yes , Sergey Sergeyevich ? - Problem ? - No , I 'm fine . I won 't keep you any longer , then . - Arkady Ilyich ... - Yes ? How 's Ivan Dmitrich 's work going ? - Ivan Dmitrich ? - Yes . My dear friends , as the director , I have to make an official announcement that the work of Department 7 in which you all took part is over . The project is terminated . You 've worked well . We 're grateful to you for spending so much time here . But , to be honest , we 're still unable to define what our device measures . It is too hard for us to influence this flux . And besides , it might be dangerous . I say once again , we are very grateful to you , but unfortunately , we cannot continue the work . You can go home now . You can pick up your pay from Accounts . That is actually all I wanted to say . If you don 't have any questions , I wish you all the best . Goodbye . Take care . Give me paw . Good dog . Easy now ... Here , eat . Do we like sausages ? Good boy ... Who 's a good boy ? Sergey Sergeyevich . Is it true ? What ? About the project . The project ... It 's been stopped . We 're sending everyone home . If they ask why , tell them that the device broke down . Make something up . Tell them it 's for their own good . What can I tell them ? Ivan , stop annoying me , will you ? We 've been assigned money for another project . An accelerator , understand ? It 'll keep the whole institute going . But you said this experiment was very important ... It used to be very important . Now there 's another one . I don 't have to justify myself to you . Stop annoying me . Don 't get your hackles up . - Hello . - Hello . This is a scientific research institute . Not a craft business . We need a project that 'll feed us all . You have to understand that . But we 've got some new results . Why didn 't you tell me ? It doesn 't matter now . You won 't find anybody . They 're scared . Let 's put it off till better times . Come on ... Beautiful dog ... I see . What ? No , I 'm fine . Yes , I 've eaten . Give my regards to Aunt Zina . I don 't know . I 'll try to make it soon . Yes . As soon as they let me go . Goodbye , Sonya . So long . OK , can we go ? Take care . Rita ! Wake up , it 's time . Rita ! Hey , Ivan ! There 's one thing I don 't get . Which Rita ? What experiment yesterday ? They all left 2 days ago ! Not her . She stayed . Who ? There was no Rita ! I remember ! There was Luba , Sveta , the twins , the late Antonina ... That 's all . And the old woman . Where is she ? Ivan , what 's wrong with you ? She doesn 't exist and she never did ! What 're you doing ? Leaving ? Yes . You 're making me . Well , don 't exaggerate ! But free your room . Make sure there 's nothing left . Here . Just like with your Rita . Tired ? OK , go on then ... Go on . # What 's he looking for ? # # A girl . # # At least I think so . # Excuse me ... Can you help me ? Come with me . I 'll get in there , and you shut me in the box . Then come here and push this thing , OK ? Come on . Go on .

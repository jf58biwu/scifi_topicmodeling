 Hey kids , it 's time for adventure at Rusty 's Day Camp For Boy Adventurers- - The largest privately run day camp ... for budding super scientists in the area . Learn adventuring from pros like action Johnny ... Master Billy Quiz-boy , and of course me ... Rusty Venture , star of the Rusty Venture cartoon . Tell mom you need excitement . Tell dad you need a cashier 's check . And we 'll see you there . At Rusty 's Day Camp For Boy Adventurers ! Makes me feel warm and fuzzy ... just trying to give back to the fans that made me . These kids paid $ 200 bucks a head to get in here ... and then you charge the another 20 to get their picture taken ... with a cardboard cutout . I 'm not sure that qualifies as " giving back . " Alright , keep it down . I don 't want my fans to know how mean you are to their hero . That 's right , it 's Rusty Venture ! When do we eat , Sam ? We wouldn 't stopped for a cruller if we knew you were gonna starve us . Oh , those are underrated . There are fully stocked vending machines right next to the gift shack . Why don 't you two get yourself an eight-dollar bag of combos ? Whew ! Wowzie , some people just shouldn 't breed . Those are some ugly kids . Kids ? You 're kidding , right ? They 're achondroplastic dwarves . And they 're almost as good as you or I ... and they deserve this camp as much as any other kid here . Such a racist . - They 're not really a race , Doc . - Will you listen to yourself , Hitler . Well , not really a Boy Adventurer . Well , why are you even here ? Because you have a big head ? Hey ! All celebrities have large heads . You ever see Christina Ricci in real life ? So what are you ? I 'm a Quiz Boy . It 's a seriously underrated branch of boy genius . Quiz boy ? You don 't really look like a little kid . Come on . OK , fine , I 'm 35 years old . You happy ? I 'm neither Boy , nor Adventurer . Brilliant . You . You solved the case of " Let 's hurt the unpaid volunteer 's feelings . " Pretty smart kid . You know what you 're gonna be ? I 'm gonna be a Boy Adventurer like Rusty Venture ! What is " wrong " ! You , my friend , are gonna be a Quiz Boy ! No , I won 't . I 'll take " yes you are " for 50 points . We can 't all be famous Adventurers . That doesn 't mean you have to be out of the adventure game altogether . You mean , become a super villain ? Shiver me timbers , no ! I 'm talking about the rubber mask set . The little guys . Do we get to wear cool costumes ? You bet you do ! If you run a museum you get yourself a glowing suit of armor . You wanna protect your gold from meddling kids ... you might try a ghost miner 49er . Look at me . I look like Johnny Depp ! Oh , and that 's not all . Sometimes you get to hang out with people who were famous once , like Cher ... and the guy that did the voice for Inspector Gadget ! What are you guys doing ? You 're on monarch time ! You snack off the clock ! Wait , see if they have that in a medium . That 's hilarious . Honey , have you seen Tim-Tom and Kevin ? Your Murderous Moppets ? I sent them out on a ... thing . Monarch , you 're not arching Dr. Venture in there , are you ? What ? No , no , sweetie . This is reconnaissance work ... Pr-preemptive Arching . Isn 't that just arching ? Well , maybe if you 're retarded it- - man of manatee ! - Where did you get that number ? - You like it ? It 's a prototype for my Dr. Mrs. The Monarch costume . I don 't want to be picky ... but you 're gonna trip on those wings . And aren 't you a little afraid that your cupcakes might slide out ? Whatever , they 're taped . I 'm more worried that it makes my ass look chunky . Oh dear ... Come here , sit on your king 's ever expanding throne . What is that ? No doubt a recruitment facility cleverly disguised ... as like , the gayest day camp ever . What 's that ? It 's huge ! It can 't be a kid . Dean , that 's a teenager . But ... but , we don 't look like that . Oh , crap ! He 's coming over here . I-I gotta go . Dude , what is your problem ? - Hey . - Hey . Your mom make you come to this loser con , too ? I don 't have a mommy . So what , I don 't have a dad . He was in black ops . Probably went undercover to kill somebody . Hey , what was that nerdy kid 's problem ? That 's my brother , Dean . He 's never seen another teenage boy before . Hey , how many of you got fathers out there ? Show of hands . You ! Why is your hand not up , man ? What ? No father ? You don 't look like Jesus , bro . My daddy died while I was sleeping . Oh , well , you had a father ... and now you 're fuckin ' free , man . Let 's go ! Come on ! I wanna see all those hands up ! Oh , wait , Action Johnny 's hand isn 't up . Why is that ? Does he not have a father ? No ! Fathers are caring and protective men . And I don 't have one of those . No . No , but who cares ? Who cares , who cares , who cares , who cares ! ! Maybe I did kill the dog . Maybe I was the lizard man that stole your precious serum . You loved that serum more than you loved me . Father ! I liked him better when he was strung out . Poor bastard . I can 't believe you got him to do this . I know . You should read his rider . He requested 20 bars of Lever 2000 , one bottle of Crystal ... one bottle of Dom Perignon , and two cases of Tropicana Twisters . Right . Who was that , Van Halen ? No , that was Sean Puffy Combs Daddy . Hey , Pop , can I show my new friend my bedroom ? I 've never had a friend in there . Ya know , Pop , I 've never even had a friend . Hank ! Stop calling me " Pop " ! If these kids find out that their hero has had sex ... their heads will explode . But I want to show my new- - This isn 't all about you , Hank . These kids want to see Rusty Venture . Maybe when there 's a cartoon called The Venture Brothers ... it 'll be different . Hey Hank , I could sure use your help with my judo class . I can 't do it without your ukemi . I 'll go change into my Gi ! Smooth , Doc . Wait till you have kids of your own . Killing Blackulas with a sword is cool . But do you know what 's really cool ? Safety ! The Order Of The Triad ... has a lot of strange and dangerous enemies . Enemies of safety ! One of our enemies is invisible ! And he can enter any home through the ground . He 's in your home now ... waiting for you in the basement . His name is Radon ! And he will give you lung cancer . Lung cancer ? But Al , I don 't smoke . Of course you don 't , Jefferson . Because smoking is more evil than the hoary Denizens of the underworld . And if you smoked , we 'd know it ... because we have a smoke detector in every room . With fresh batteries ! Remember- - if a smoke detector doesn 't work , the silence ... Could be deadly ! - When did we lose them ? - That was my fault . I really hit them with that Radon part . We never get to my song ! Alright , you really gotta pound that hip in there . Break his balance . You can 't just pull the guy over . You have to roll him over your hip . What 's that throw called ? That one 's called o-goshi . You mean O-gay-shi . You guys look like a couple of bonobo chimps . - What ? - O-gay-shi ... Somebody pulls that ridiculous move on me ... I 'd land my inside axe kick on their face . I call it the widow-maker . If I , like , kick a guy married with it . Alright . Maybe you wanna come up here and show us some of your technique . Yeah , you wish . Too bad I had to register my hands and instep ... as lethal weapons . The friggin ' government made me do that . What are you- - Kid , seriously ? Are you for real ? Brock , are your feet registered ? Nobody 's are . They don 't even do that . This kid 's insane . Yeah , that 's right . You better walk away ... I 'm not going anywhere . What a- - what are you doing ? Alright junior Adventurers ! Who wants a tour of Rusty 's scientastic facilities ? What was that up there ? That kid was pushing my buttons hard . I-I-I wanted to beat on him . Don 't even think about it , I 'm uninsured . Go cool down . You look like you 're gonna pop a blood vessel . Yeah , I don 't know what 's got into me . All aboard for fun ! Next stop ... Excitement town ! Don 't forget to collect your free smile from the trolley conductor . What are you two idiots doing ? Get on that golf cart thing ! Now ! Sweetie , calm down . Honestly . It 's a tour of the compound ! That idiot Dr. Venture is about to open his shirt ... and tell me where to stick the knife ! You 're arching . I 'm seizing an opportunity . Now how do you do a screen capture ? It 's like shift , option- - Oh , crap ! I made an umlaut . Hey , we 're gonna use the buddy system . The person seated next to you is your buddy . Say " hi " to your buddy . Hi , buddy . If you touch something that melts your fingers off tell your buddy . If you get a face full of burning hydrofluoric acid ... it 's your buddy that drags you to one of the many eyewash stations . Any questions ? When do we get to meet Rusty ? I 'm Rusty Venture . Why can 't you kids wrap your heads around that ? What happened ? I left Neverland so I could marry Wendy . What do you think happened ? Any good questions ? Yes , the kid that 's bigger than everyone else . Yeah , it 's Pat . Pat McCrotch . Yeah , is this gonna suck the whole time ... or is this the only part that sucks ? I just want to gauge how much suck I have to friggin sit through . Any real questions about the tour ? OK , the blond boy . Yes , Walter . Walter Melon . Is this gonna be doo-doo stupid- - Walter . Walter , is it ? Yes , locked in your room for two weeks with nothing to eat but potatoes . And no car , ever . - What does that have to do- - - Oh , what ? I 'm sorry , I thought you asked me how long your father ... is going to punish you . So anybody that doesn 't immediately give you respect , you murder ? No , no . Well ... I mean , I don 't always kill them or anything . Just like a bruise or two as a little reminder . - I mean ... until this kid . - Just talk to him . When you treat a young man like an adult , he acts like an adult . If he was an adult , I 'd kick his ass . You can 't stoop to their level . Yeah , that 's the tr- - but another kid could , right ? No , I know where you are going with this . Yeah , I could get another kid to beat him down . - Not even close . - Don 't bother . I 'm not listening . - Who do I make this out to ? - Dean . Wait , you 're not one of the Venture twins , are you ? My dad told me so say " no " to that . Look , kid , I have a plane parked right over there . You say the word and we are outta here , man . You don 't need to live like this . - Dean ? - Here . Just say the word- - What are you doing , Jon ? Leave the kid alone . Just signing one of my baby pictures , Samson . " Action Johnny " Hey , Dean , you wanna come with me . I need a favor . Just say the word , man ! The E-Den ! A fully enclosed , self sustaining biological environment . Designed to prepare a single male and female astronaut ... for long term , space station inhabitancy . Why is it so dirty ? My father died before he taught me to care . Alright , Billy , wanna give me a hand with this door ? It 's rusted shut . When was the last time you opened this ? The project was abandoned 40 years ago . Maybe it 's a push door . Are you pulling or pushing ? Huh , thought it would be empty ... with , like , a plaque that says how wonderful my dad was . Alright , hands in pockets . I don 't care how soft something looks there 's no putting your lips on anything . This place smells like a hamper in a hippie 's commune . It 's spooky . Hey , don 't touch that ! It will make you sterile . Wh-what is that ? OK , kids . So ... The E-Den . A self contained- - We probably should get back to the camp grounds . Arts and crafts- - It 's OK , I 've talked to a gorilla before . I know their language . Koko , fine animal person gorilla . Brows drink polite nipple there hurry . Frown bad ! Billy ! Billy , I need a kitten ! - Why do you need a kitten ? - They like kittens . Don 't move , they can smell fear ! - Can they smell urine ? - It 's like liquid fear ! I pretty much knew this was gonna happen . That 's why I keep this sweet Betty ready to play . The SMK Westlake S2 . Cool beans . Is that a BB gun ? Pellet , douche ! Spring firing ! Like I need a CO2 cartridge going off in my pants . Mr. Action has just joined the server ... Meow ... I 'm a pretty kitten , meow . This isn 't working and I don 't know why you think it would ! Oh ! Son of a bitch ! Tour 's over , kids ! Everybody out ! Harder . Like , as hard as you can . Start with your shoulders and snap it . Try to punch behind my hand . Come on , Dean , at least keep your wrist straight . - Where 's your brother ? - He went on dad 's tour . - Doc . - What ! Is Hank with you ? Hold on ... - Yes , Hank is alive . - What ? - Look , Brock , I gotta go . - Yeah , alright . Hey , we have that demonstration thing at five . - And could you tell Hank tha- - - Yes , bye ! Let me out ! It 's me ! Let me out ! - Are you alone ? - Yes ! Let me out ! Now ! OK ! Everybody back on the people mover . Come on ! This is a fun day camp ! I jettisoned the hand . Got away . I wasn 't alone in there . We lost one . Well , where was his buddy ? He had a buddy ! They all had buddies ! Rusty ... I saw a little kid get disemboweled . You always wanted to be an Adventurer . Not like answering trivia , is it , boy ? OK , this is what 's gonna happen . I 'm gonna tell the kids that the ape was a guy in a costume ... and never speak of this again . Now give me that shoe . How did you work with those two idiots all those years ? I can 't believe they missed the tour ! Will you look at them ... You can 't just send my Moppets out to arch your former enemy . I put our name in with the Guild , and we 'll be getting- - I don 't wanna hate just anybody . I wanna hate Venture . Oh , here we go again . Shh-shh ! Wait ! This should be good . A hit , huh ... You want us to make him suffer ... or just end it quick and quiet like ? No , no , nothing permanent . Just , like , give him a little taste of fear . And I guess you could break something small ... like a toe . - We could take out his tongue . - With a knife . - Or remove his heart ? - Yeah , with a knife . - A bigger knife . - Fucking knife ! Yeah , you guys are , uh- - you 're kinda creepy . I think this may be a stupid idea . Yeah , hey , uh , Monarch . You wanna call the spooky twins home ... before I throw them there ? Ahh ! Crap ! - He can 't see you . - Get down ! Oh , and Doc really misses you idiots . I 'm pretty sure he cries himself to sleep at night . - He does ? - Yeah . Really ? Now when I come out , you guys yell , " ghost ! " Why don 't we get to be ghosts ? We have actual ghost experience . It 's a waste of good magic . I have only the one sea ghost costume . And you would not believe how many pirate costumes I have . Sorry I 'm late . OK , where 's Doc ? I want to get this out of the way . Whoa , whoa , whoa . It says in the program ... " Action Johnny and special guest star . " Johnny don 't like " and special " anything ! Failures ! Both of you ! Failures ! I can 't even send you out for the simplest mission . It 's like you were trying to fail me ! Was that the hover tank ? Great , Sgt. Hatred . I can 't even watch . This is worse than seeing you with another man ! Hey , that was not my idea . I thought it would turn me on . But it was just double the embarrassment . - Boo ! - Aahh ! Whoa , not too jumpy pants . Who did you think I was ? Sorry , I thought you were Hank 's new giant boy friend . So Hank 's finally out ? He thinks that Dermott kid is the kitty 's pajamas ... and he is , in fact , very rude . You 're pretty cute sometimes . And you 're the most- - You two girls talking about your periods ? Don 't let us men disturb your tea party . I 'm sure Silent Sally has some sweet makeup tips for ya . Oh , and here 's another one- - Keep your seatbelt on at all times . Thanks , Brock . These loafers have leather soles . Italian . Where were you ? I was cooking something up in the lab . We 've been keeping the crowd waiting with safety tips . Action Johnny ! Come give your Uncle Z a hug . What is this shit ? What is this shit man ? Is this some kind of a joke ? Did my father send you ? Did he ... Keep him off of me ! He 's all kinds of crazy . Brock , go cool Johnny off . Get him a Zima or something . Oh , God , oh God ! Come now , Dr. Venture , you told me it would be all cool . Then I get here and Johnny 's wired . Yes , Dr. Venture ! Wired like a time bomb attached to a killer whale ! Set to go off the moment you try to free yourself ... You never lose it . Seriously , you told me Johnny was clean now . He 's been dry for a month . But he 's been downing Xanax like they were Cheetos . He 'll be fine . Just get in your little helicopter and do a few passes . OK . Can I shoot at him ? I don 't think so . How ' bout scorpions ? Can I drop scorpions on him ? I bet that foreign guy could totally trounce your dad 's lover . - Who ? - Your dad 's lover in the bunny suit . The one who picked Action Johnny up like he was gonna totally hump him . Dude , do you have any idea what a dork you are ? I mean , any ? You think you 're all hardcore , but you are so Dave Matthews . You 're lucky you look like a suicide girl ... because of your- - Nobody ! That 's not how ! Whoa ! Silent Sally speaks ! OK , why don 't you wait for me naked while I kick your boyfriend 's- - Ow ! Come on ! You 're very rude ! Ahh ! That child is a spinning murdertop . Are you sure he 's your son ? Dean ! Stop hitting the- - No , no- - They 're kids , they 're kids . Why don 't you let them work this out . Yeah . This is Sgt. Hatred ! Your nemesis ! Welcome to flaming hell , Dr. Venture ! Scorch it , boys ! Not now . Whoa there ! Call off your Yeti-mummy ! Ahh , he 's murdering my boy . This is monkey business ! Brock , that suit is rented ! Stop getting blood on it . He started it ! You can 't just kill my bo- - What 's this now ? Come on , Venture . You gotta get these kids off me . I got a court order that says I can 't be around these ... sexy little children ! Alright , kids , nice job vanquishing the villain . Isn 't this the best play you ever saw ? Now go back to your seats . We got to get on the same page here . I 'm just pulling a Moses on some shrubs . It 's rock bottom henching . Well , you can 't just barge in and expect a hug . I 'm running a day camp today . My patoot . Says right here- - " Wednesday , 5 : 30 , menace Dr. Venture . " Let me see that . And I 'm sorry about my man Brock . He 's not as good with children as I am and they 're getting to him . OK , here 's your problem , 5 : 30 a.m ... . a.m. Looks like a fancy " P. " Alright , fine . Malice troop ! Back in the hover tank ! - Private Schwa ! - Sir ! Yeah , ask the gang where they want to stop for chow . Sir , yes sir ! I 'm thinking a little soup . See if Au Bon Pain is OK . So , I 'm just gonna tick this off as an arch . If you could just sign here . And there 's a little space for comments . I guess you could say I was absolutely menacing and- - This bruhaha brings me back ! Get right out of town ! The Doctor Z ! Oh , man , I love your work . When you had Kassim eaten by what- - A-a-a damn cheetah or something . The guy kills his own number two . That is priceless . The fool ! He made his last blunder ! Oh , oh ! This guy right here- - Total pro ! Oh , I gotta get a picture ! - Private Tilday ! - Sir ! Yes , sir ! Get the surveillance equipment . Well , I better get the little guy home . Keep an eye out for his hand . Yeah , yeah . I 'm sure it 'll turn up . That 's my dad ! Thanks for the zombie self defense lessons , Mr. Samson . Uh ... Have you seen our son , Kyle ? Oh , there you are ! I have your sweet boy here . You sure he 's okay ? He 's limp . And did you- - We shaved his head for the sack race . Wind resistance . Yeah , first place . Then , in Boy Adventurer tradition we poured victory plasma over him . Heh , heh . Good fun . He 'll be fine . - You didn 't ... - Oh , please . You shoulda seen that kid 's DNA . He was a ticking time bomb of cancer . I cleared that up . Trust me , they 'll thank me after they re-potty-train him . Short and Sassy shampoo ? Do they even make that anymore ? Ummm , no , because you mix Short and Sassy ... with the active ingredient in Certs , which is Retsyn , you get napalm . You lather that up , and it 's goodbye to , like , most of your face . Tsch . That 's my mom . I gotta brush . OK . Hey , Dermott ? Are you gonna call me or whatever friends do when they 're friends ? Yeah , we 'll hang . Shake it sleazy , loser . Bye bye , loser ! Heh heh . Dermott , sweetie ? Did you meet him ? Yeah ... he was okay . You sure he 's my real father ? How did we do , mum ? Just as I asked . My little Moppets were perfect as always . Come give your lady a hug . Mmm , I like the new costume , mum . I like hugging you in the new costume .

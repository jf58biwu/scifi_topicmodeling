 Sub Ripped and Sync by : jeevma Sakeasi . Yeah . Go ahead . You were supposed to check in five minutes ago . What are you doing ? I " m chilling , man . I " m on my lunch break . Everything is fine . Just fine . Rules are rules , Sakeasi . Every 30 minutes . No excuses . Yeah . Sure , man . Whatever . Access authorised . Damn ! Damn it . That is Australian champagne . Now , I must " ve said a dozen times that you will serve French until they " re too drunk to know what the hell they " re drinking . Do you understand ? Do it . Awesome , sir . Eyes like a hawk . " Primal Park . " Brilliant , sir . Brilliant . Alan , do I look like a politician ? Just save your sycophantic remarks till you are back in Washington . I " m just giving praise where it is due , sir . I just want you to stop the brown-nosing long enough to do an entry protocol check with Security for me . Sir , shouldn " t I be here when Mr Grant arrives ? - No , I can handle it . He " s my brother-in-law . - Ex , sir . Yes , I suppose I should count myself lucky in that respect . Why do you need his money ? I mean , the Japanese are falling all over ... It " s not his money . I want him to covet what I have . I want him to crawl to me on his hands and knees and beg me to cut him in . And I want to see him weep when I cut him off . Might sound heartless , Alan , but it " s not . I mean it in a caring way . - Now get your shiny little butt out of here . - Okay . Oh , and , Alan , get it right . Do you have any idea how much is riding on the success of this presentation ? No , I don " t . Well , not exactly , sir . I " m not strong with figures . $ 872,423,000 . And not that it matters , 42 cents . Well , you certainly have a way with figures , sir . You can " t help yourself , can you ? Just remember , if anything goes wrong , I mean anything , you " re toast . And you , my fiscally challenged friend , will be freezing your butt off back in Washington faster than you can say , " Where are my Guccis ? " Now go . Sakeasi checked in yet ? No , not yet . He " s at Gate 21 , right ? Area 21 , Gate 4 . Well , he " s late . - ls he on the booze again ? - No , most assuredly not . Ms Savannah , he " s my best friend . I can vouch for him . Yeah , that " s what I " m afraid of . Grant , delighted you could make it . Niles , you know that I would never miss the opportunity to see you fall on your face . Speaking of which , how " s your portfolio ? I understand that you were crushed in the market . " Buy low , sell high " is a concept you find difficult ? You should upgrade your spies , Grant . Look around . Nothing could be further from the truth . The truth ? Now that is a concept I know you have difficulty with . So , I " m supposed to be seeing something here but I " ve something you should see . Don " t stand too close to him . He " s liable to drool on you . Niles . Autumn . - Delighted . - Very nice to meet you . My sister suffered the great misfortune of being married to him . It was the most painful three months of her life . Three months . She said , " That " s it . That " s long enough . " I gotta tell you , rarely have I seen a divorce that was so delightful . I mean , I was actually moved to tears . Of joy . You know , Grant , I think we can do without the Leave it to Beaver reminiscences . Haven " t known a family this close since the Mansons . - Please . - Thank you , Niles . - Code orange . - We got a code orange on Gate 4 . There " s been endless trouble with that control box . - lt " s a false alarm for sure . - Yeah , it looks like it . Okay , so you " re gonna go down and check it out ? That won " t be necessary . This is the eighth time it has malfunctioned this week . We " ll replace the whole unit in the next service . Okay , so what if there is something wrong ? - Okay , this could cost me my job . - Yeah , we should be so lucky . Guys ! Alan , if you wanna go down there , be our guest . But the protocol is three failures in one week , replace at the next service , okay ? Nobody gives a rat " s ass about security around here . " Nobody gives a rat " s ass about security around here . " Hey , how " s it going ? Hi , guys . - Okay , why " re these dudes wearing dresses ? - lt " s tradition , dumbass . God , Kirk , do you have to embarrass us the second we get here ? All I " m saying is I didn " t fly halfway around the world to see some guys in drag . I came to see some topless native chicks . Wow , our only jock turns out to be a pig . Why am I not surprised ? - Let me take that for you . - Because this pig has the goods . The power envelope that we " ve all been waiting to open . And who do they trust to hang on to it ? The jock . Maybe I should just rip it up . Moron , I " ll hold on to that . This maybe a joke to you but it " s not to me . Don " t let him get to you . He wants to win just as much as we do . Yeah , I guess you " re right , Alys . Brains are what is needed to win this whole thing . Yeah , you " re right . And he was standing behind the door when they passed them out . I am so over muscles . Smoke detected . Smoke alarm . - Where ? - South wing . Service Tunnel 7 . There shouldn " t be anyone down there . Show me . Bring it in a little bit closer . There " s your culprit . It " s Brian . Damn . Brian , it " s Savannah . Come in . Brian , put the torch away . Either he can " t hear you or he " s ignoring you . Yeah . Brian , you set the alarm off . Niles doesn " t want any problems today . Cheeky fellow . He is ignoring you . You think ? Well , I " m afraid I " ll have to kill him . Shoot him in the head , Ms Savannah . Little less blood to clean up . Robbie . Great to see you . - How " s your father ? - He " s fine , sir . He sends his regards . Well , welcome to Valalola . I " m Niles Green . I " m the manager , the owner and your host . - l " m impressed . - So you should be . Come on , let " s get you checked in . This way . Okay , listen up , guys , I " m supposed to personally read the instructions when we get here so ... Alaina , if you don " t mind . Touch me again , Kirk , and you " ll be deader than disco . All right . " Welcome to the Annual Phi Beta Scavenger Hunt . " Our new pledges , along with those of our sister sorority house , - " have 24 hours from ... " - From the time we finish these drinks . Okay , fine . From the time we finish these drinks " to complete their mission . - " Hand out envelopes to each . " - No . No . See , that " s a parenthetical . You don " t read that part . You just hand out ... I know what a parasitical is , okay ? Here . Don " t open them until I tell you to . " lnside each envelope is a card with the name of an object " that exists on ... " - Valalola . - " lsland . " " Here are the rules . There are no rules . " You may bribe , beg , borrow or steal in order to find your assigned object . " Those who succeed will pledge . " Those who fail define themselves as inferior collegiate " peons unworthy of intercourse with Phi Beta brothers and sisters . " Open your envelopes . " A conch shell . " What " s that ? It " s like one of those big shells that you blow like a trumpet . You " ve got them in those Tarzan movies and stuff . Great . What did you guys get ? I got " an antique ceremonial shell spear . " Why would you wanna spear shells ? No , it " s a spear with shells on it , bozo . " The bowl from a cotton candy machine . " " A cannibal fork " ? Way to go . In your dreams . Mine says " a box of M-80s . " What " s an M-80 ? Firecrackers . Like cherry bombs . Back home we used to tie them to bullfrogs and blow " em ... Oh , Kirk , you know , you are living proof that the human race is evolving backwards . You know what ? Your attitude sucks , Goth girl . You know that ? Read my lips , beefcake , a Goth " s attitude is supposed to suck . Guys , let " s not bicker and fight over who killed who , okay ? Don " t worry about it , it " s nothing serious . Yeah , that " s what they said about the plague . Hey . Hello ! Wow . Casual Friday ? With accessories . Video 3 disabled . What the ... Wow . False alarm , my ass . - Security , this is Alan . - Go ahead . False alarm , my ass , we " ve got a genuine code orange here . Okay , we " ll check it out . Oh , nice . I hate that song . Come on , tiger . Savannah , are you still tied up down there ? Not at the moment . What " s up ? We " ve got a problem . There " s a confirmed breach at Gate 4 . I " ll be right there . Shit ! Oh , check that out . - Oh , man ! - We " re totally porked . This would be the only place that " d have a cotton candy machine . Who knows what else . But , hey , the rules are is that there are no rules . Think you can hack the security system ? Yeah , maybe . I mean , I used to hack into hotels in high school . You know , get free rooms for friends , but what do you want me to do ? It " s closed . Let " s go . Oh , nice . Nice . All right . - Nope . Looks like we " re out of luck . - Well , let " s make some luck . Dude , what " re you doing ? - The fragile X gene at work . - The what gene ? Fragile X. It " s a very rare gene , although it is found in 92 % of people in jail . Figures . As they say in Italy , voilá ! One . Two . Three . I am so over criminal behaviour . You know , there might be the kind of stuff we " re looking for in there . I guess beg , borrow and steal now includes breaking and entering . Let " s go . Sachariah . Tell me the cats are here . Shoot ! There has been a systems failure down at one of the gates . They were due back for feeding half an hour ago . Are they fairly regular ? Like clockwork , usually . - So , why the hell aren " t they here ? - Maybe they " ve eaten already . What ? There " s wild pigs out there . All kinds of stuff for them to eat . Don " t worry , Savannah , they " ll be back . This is from the cellar of a particularly conceited young duke . We were locked in a game of baccarat in Monte Carlo . We each bet something we prized dearly . My Lear jet against his wine cellar . Guess who won ? The duke , he didn " t care . He " d stolen it from Imelda Marcos , which is the least I " d expect from a family that had been filthy rich for 800 years . And rich is what I " m gonna be when my park opens . Hi , very nice to meet you . - Lovely party . - Yeah . Ladies , gentlemen , investors . I " m Niles Green . And I " m honoured by your presence as we celebrate the completion of Valalola Primal Park , stage one . Oh , yeah ! That " s gorgeous ! Well done . Well done . Bravo . Fiji , and this , our very own private island . It " s the perfect testing ground for a concept in live entertainment , which is unique , exciting , at the very cutting edge of the veterinary and genetic sciences . And need I say something , which I firmly believe ... His accent is very impressive , don " t you think ? ... investment you have ever made . All right ! By next spring , our five-star resort will connect to a midway with the most spectacular rides and our special attraction . The world " s most unique zoo , featuring the most astounding living creatures ever seen by modern man . I don " t want to blind you with too much science , but what I " m about to share with you , you must keep secret for the moment . But a recent breakthrough in the genetic multiplication of mitochondrial DNA has led to our first major success here at Valalola . And in the next six months , I " m assured by my scientific team that multiple replications will indeed have been carried out . Now , what does all this mean ? It means , my friends , that visitors to this island will see a world that mankind has not glimpsed for nearly a million years . " Genetic miracles reasonably priced . " And for you , the investor , the chosen one , a happy band of fiscal brothers , an endless stream of unimaginable wealth . Is that good ? There " ll be dollars , ducats and shillings , shekels , roubles and yen , and francs , pesos , pesetas , euros , the new kid on the block , and let " s not forget our old humble friend the zloty . A tidal wave of cash rolling into your private ... No , ultra-private , uber-private , numbered Austrian bank account , which I will give as a gift to every single one of you who invests with me in this dream . You come with me on this journey . And when they write the financial history of the 21st century they will start with your names . Primal Park ! Primal Park ! Splendid to see you . How are you ? Good to see you . Thank you so much . It is so exciting . Thank you . My pleasure . Hi , welcome . Welcome indeed . Thank you . Please . Wonderful to see you . Please invest . Valalola Primal Park . How are you ? Good to see you . Thank you . Great to see you . How are you ? Thank you so much . It is so exciting . Indeed . Thank you . Thank you so much . Ladies , gentlemen . Food , wine , help yourselves . The office is open . Bring your chequebooks . We " re open for business . Thank you very much . Sir , excuse me . We have a problem . We " ve got a code orange on Gate 4 and the cats haven " t returned to their pen . So ? So I recommend that we lock down the park . Remove the guests . Get them off the island . Oh , no , no , no . I mean ... Ruining the investors " celebration is not an option . Savannah , my reputation and your ass is on the line here . Sir , I " m sorry . These people are in imminent danger . This is Primal Park . Danger " s not in our vocabulary . People could get eaten . The only thing that " s gonna get eaten around here is some very expensive canapé . Now I don " t care how you do it . You get those cats back in their cages . And you make sure that none of my guests find out about this . - But , sir , the ... - Do it . Fine . Damn . Swimsuits . Check one . - He won " t lock it down or evacuate . - Should have known it . - The cats aren " t in the cages , right ? - Right . What if we turn everything in the park on ? Lights , music , PA systems ... You name it . That way , if they " re hiding somewhere , we can drive " em into the lab . - Do you still have your Spice Girls album ? - Yeah . Souvenirs . Come on . Unauthorised ... Jerk , you set off an alarm ! Please leave this area ... The doors weren " t wired and we checked the cameras , remember ? Unauthorised intrusion . Please leave this area immediately and report to Security . Sakeasi , Security . Do you read ? Sakeasi , it " s Savannah . Do you read ? What exactly did Alan say ? Code orange . 21 . Gate 4 . Damn it , Sakeasi . Ms Savannah , he " s my friend . Let me sort this out . Okay . Thank you . We " re totally screwed . They know we " re here . Get tough , man . Stop being such a wuss . Boo ! Keep it down . God , there " s cameras everywhere . - Kirk " s right . - Well , that " s once in a row . What , did you guys follow us ? So , this must be the place where they intended us to find all the stuff , right ? First thing we gotta do is shut down the cameras and alarms so we can break into these shops . So , what " s with all this criminal stuff , anyway ? Why can " t we just pick a lock or something ? It " s not criminal . It " s ROTC . For him it " s as natural as pulling the wings off of flies . Guys , stay here . I think I know what to do . I " m going with him . - What are you doing ? - Hush , be quiet . Oh , damn . Could you hold this ? Okay . Back up . Robbie ! I think you " ve picked up some very bad habits . Lie down with dogs , get up with fleas ? So why " d you follow me , anyway ? I thought you might need some help . My father programmed some of the basic code for Linux . You gotta be kidding me . You must be filthy rich . No , he signed it away . Loyalty to the company and all that . Yeah , my father was the same way . Yeah , my dad was hardcore . Wouldn " t even let me date till I was 18 . Oh , probably shouldn " t tell you , but , I " m 20 and I still haven " t really dated . But you " re such a nice guy . - You think so ? - Yeah , I think so . Watch out . Nice ! Let " s go . Sakeasi ! Come on . Bingo . This is it . Bingo . I could plug into the system right here . Great . Third one up from the bottom , right ? Oh , yeah . All right . Unit disabled . Unit disabled . Unit disabled . Disabled . Disabled . Disabled . Right . Listen up . I need a conch shell . So let " s all spread out and check all the souvenir shops . Time out , bozo . This isn " t just about you . Yeah , no kidding , Kirk . You are so selfish . My God , we " ve all got things to find here . And the clock " s ticking . And life would be so much simpler if you would just stop whining . Hey , you guys , Robbie shut down the entire system . Cameras , security , the lot . See , I told you I knew what I was doing . You didn " t do it , jackass . He did . Anybody could have hacked this place . They used the name of their hotel as the password . The security sucks . Security ? Security , come in please . Robbie " s got the cotton candy thing . Alaina " s got the spear , Alys needs the box of M-80s and my favourite chick in the whole entire world , Collette , needs the cannibal fork . Through the head if you ask me . I think we should split up into teams . Alys and Robbie , me and Collette . - Whoa ! One of you chicks goes with me . - Uh-huh , Kirk . Grown-ups only on our team . Well , you better make it fast . I mean , once they find out the alarms are off this place is gonna be crawling with security dudes . Stupid , freaking , loser chicks . This isn " t good . Power " s down . Savannah here . I need a signal check . Anyone read ? It must be the transmitter . That means that the cats can get out at any one of these gates . You know what ? I think this power failure has just happened . That means there " s a good chance they " re all still inside here , all right . This ought to keep " em down until you get all these gates tied off . Yeah . Hey , Brian . - Heads up , right ? - Right . You , too . Don " t shoot ! Damn , you scared the hell out of me ! The power " s down on the security system . I can " t reach base . I know . Savannah " s tying up the gates . - You see any of the cats ? - I got lucky . It looks like they were worn out from hunting pigs most likely . I sounded the horn . Both went into their cages without a shot . Yes ! I gotta say it again . You Fijian warriors have it all over us pale white guys . Oh , that " s good . Well , we " re not sure what " s going on . It could be a virus . We don " t know . Well , is the backup power on ? Well , yeah , but it " s weird . I mean , it " s on in some areas and not in others . Dance with me . I paid $ 2.8 million for that system . Just get it going . - And there is something else . - What ? - No , maybe I shouldn " t say . - No . Come on , come on , out with it . Well , the new technician , he told me some gossip about you and the lady . What ? Give me a break , you " ve got a problem with Savannah and I ? No , no , no , my friend . It " s just that ... But what do you know about the men who worked here before and who ... - Who what ? - Nothing , but ... We Fijians are , what you might say , superstitious . We believe in a magic between people , good and bad and ... Well , three men in a row came into a relationship with your beautiful lady and all three are no longer here . - Where " d they go ? - All three died . - What ? - ln terrible , horrible ways . So , you think that Savannah had something to do with this ? Of course not . She " s the sweetest , finest American woman I " ve ever known , but her first lover was killed by an anaconda . He died in excruciating pain . The second was electrocuted , his arm caught in high-tension wires , and the third , the one she was to marry , in a bizarre gardening accident . He fell from a tree when the men below were swinging their machetes and took his head clean off . You think I " m gonna be the fourth guy ? As I said , some would say it " s superstition . - Others would say it " s ... - Say it " s what ? The evil eye . The evil eye . The evil ... What do you know about exotic poisons ? Nothing . - Where " s Sakeasi ? - Home by now . I warned Sundip that I " d fire him if he didn " t give up drinking . I " d guess he took him home so he could sleep it off . What " s the problem with the power , Brian ? Batteries on the plasma screen are running down . And I " ve got 200 bottles of very expensive wine reaching an undrinkable temperature up there . Plus , I " ve heard enough damn Fijian music to last me three lifetimes . - You get the power working . You get it now . - Yes , sir . - Can you get them to shut up ? - Not while you " re around . They sense when someone doesn " t like them . What " s that supposed to mean ? They " re everything to me . Every cent l " ve got is tied up in there . They " re my licence to print money . I love them , damn it ! The power , you fix it . Sounds like he " s off their Christmas list . All right . All right . I " ll get this side . You take that side . - I found it . - No way . - I did . I found it . - No freaking way . Oh , my God . This is it . - Oh , my God . - This is it . Here . Make sure you get the whole thing , all right ? - Ready ? - Ready . Cheese . - You got it ? - Yeah . Let me see . I did the calculations of the odds of , of winning that ... Come on , let " s go . Quit it . It " s totally crashed . All right , now I get to tell Niles that he paid $ 2.8 million for this piece of crap . Oh , well ... Since we " re at loose ends maybe I can take care of something else . Oh , yeah . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , yeah . No . I " m crazy about you . I was too forward , wasn " t l ? I was afraid I would turn you off . I really like you , Brian . I " m sorry . It " s not that . I heard things , you know ... - My evil eye ? - Yeah . - And you believe what they say ? - No , of course not . I ... It " s just that you lose one boyfriend and that " s a tragedy . You lose three boyfriends and it looks like carelessness . It was a coincidence . - You afraid ? - Me ? No . You know , this is the first I " ve heard about it . Maybe I " m just gonna need some time to mull it over , or buy some life insurance . Look , maybe you don " t know what it " s like to be blamed for the terrible things in your life that you have no control over . Or maybe you " re just like every other stupid , insensitive male . Either way , I " m gonna go have a drink . Feel free not to join me . Brilliant speech , Niles , but it " s gonna take more than your usual ration of bull to impress me . I " m not trying to impress you . Just want to show you something . Come on . Come on . 500-room hotel . Adjoining amusement park and zoo . That " s it ? A hotel and a zoo ? Niles , you " re on the cutting edge here , my friend . Of dull . Monumentally dull . But , then , it would be unfair of me to expect any kind of original thinking from you . I " ll tell you what , have your people send the prospectus to my attorneys . But wait . There " s more . Ladies and gentleman , if you care to follow me . - Let " s go . - What " s going on ? Aren " t those , like , old weapons on the back wall ? Yeah . Wow ! Cool stuff . Clubs , hatchets , swords . No spears . Look over here . Let " s go . So , Niles , fess up . Looks like you managed a fluke here , but why not ? You know , we all get lucky sooner or later . You rely on luck , Grant . Me , I rely on planning . That " s the difference between us . No , no , Niles . The difference between us is really much simpler . It " s the bottom line . See , if you sell a share of my common stock , you can buy yourself a brand new Beamer , fully loaded . But you sell a share of your common stock , you might , just might , get it to stretch to a bottle of $ 2 chuck . Well , you certainly know your wines , Grant . When Primal Park is franchised worldwide , you " re gonna be selling your first born just to buy an option for one share . I can " t wait to stomp all over your dreams . You " re gonna need bigger boots . Much bigger . Wow ! All right . See how less pixelated this one is . It " s got so many dots per inch . Okay , all right . One , two , three ... Three out of five , that " s a start . Yeah , well , finding cannibal forks ain " t exactly the slam-dunk it used to be . So I " m gonna ... Ladies and gentlemen , if you care to follow me ... Oh , man . Go , go , go , go . Do be careful , ladies and gentlemen . It " s still a construction site as you can see . After you . You were supposed to come after me . I mean , I really , really thought you were gonna come after me . Well , I didn " t want you to think that I was chasing after you . - What ? - I was really out of line back there . I was a stupid ... What " d you call me ? Stupid , insensitive male . Right , that ... Really sorry that I was that . Okay . - Do you really mean that ? - Yeah . I think it " s in the main switchboard . I think I " m gonna go check it out . Okay . Put it down . Let " s go ! What is this place ? Looks like some sort of laboratory . Robbie , check this out . - What do you think it is ? - I don " t know . An incubator ? Awfully big , though , for hatching eggs . Why would they need an incubator ? Oh , remember all those signs for an animal park or something ? Maybe this is part of their animal breeding thing . - Oh , God . I " m gonna be sick . - Foetuses . Probably some prematurely born animals . This one looks like some sort of mutated cat . I gotta get out of here . Now . Help me ! Help me ! Alaina ? - Alaina ? - Help me ! Help me ! Alaina ? Alaina ? No ! Hey , where did everybody go ? - What " s that ? - lt " s a conch . - Okay . - Great earrings . Thanks . - You " re cute . What " s your name ? - Kirk . - l " m Sharona . - Oh , as in , My Sharona . - Wow . Never heard that before . - Thanks . So , Kirk , like a drink ? Does a bear dump in the woods ? - Savannah . - What " s wrong ? The cats are gone . What ? How ? When the power went off all the doors opened . Niles and the others are touring the forest . If the cats are loose ... No , I told Niles not to have anyone out there . Okay , we gotta get everyone back to the hotel . - Niles invested millions in those animals . - I don " t care . I " ve got three staff members that are missing . I don " t plan on being number four . They are too important to destroy . You don " t have any proof that they " ve hurt anybody ... I don " t give a damn ! Oh , hey ! What in the hell are you guys doing down here ? - We got lost . - Right . It " s not safe down here , all right . If you guys have anything to do with this blackout , I swear ... Hey , don " t look at us ! We just wanted to see the park and we ended up in here . Yeah , well , that " s trespassing . I " m gonna let the police on the mainland sort this one out . Shoot , this isn " t gonna work . - Do we really need to involve the police ? - Yeah , we do . - Hey ! - Run ! Hey ! Hey ! - What if he shoots us ? - For trespassing ? Oh , damn , I lost a contact . - I only got " em last week . - I know , I " m on my second pair this month . Stay there ! What " s wrong ? Are you guys hurt ? Oh , my God . How many of you are in here ? She only counts as one . Just us . - How many ? - Five . - Five ? - There were five . - Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ... - Where are the others ? - We don " t know . - Stop the bullcrap , okay ! Unless you wanna end up like that or worse . - There " s a worse than that ? - Yeah . Smaller pieces . - What did that ? - You don " t wanna know . I " ll tell you this , though , it " s still out there . You gotta do something . We gotta get out of here . Let " s go out this way . Watch your step , though . This blood " s real slippery . You might fall and hurt yourself . Go . Come on . There we are . Niles . - l " ve seen enough . - Well , that " s unfortunate . There " s still something I think you " d want to see . I think not . Autumn , grab your things , we " re out of here . You know , Grant , I " m not feeling very well . Maybe we could have some privacy and I could sit down for a while . There " s a couch in my office . Brian , come in . - l " m worried . - He " s a big boy . It " s a big cat . Come on . Go . Go ! Robbie " s computer ! He " s got to be around here somewhere . I mean , he " d die before he " d leave this lying around . Brian , come in . Please , give me a status on the power . Something . What ? Okay , say again . Where the hell are you ? Sachariah , hold on . Looks like one of yours . - Robbie ! - God ! - You all right ? - I think so ... - Must have locked myself in ... - Thank God you " re okay . But Alaina , she " s ... It just came out of freaking nowhere . There was nothing I could do . All right , cry . Nobody " s blaming you . It " s all right . I " m blaming me ! I just let her run out there and get torn up and I gotta live with that . Come on . Let " s get you out of here . Here you are . You all right ? Please , make yourself comfortable . - Glass of water ? - That would be nice . - You all right , Autumn ? - l " ll be fine , honey . - There you are . - Thank you . So , Niles , let " s cut the crap . What do you really have going on here ? It " s called Smilodon fatalis . What ? What fatalis ? Smilodon . It " s a prehistoric cat . Born and bred right here on the island . You know the best part ? Weighs 785 pounds . It " s ... Niles , even by your standards that sounds like pure bull . A prehistoric cat ? It " s what you today would incorrectly call a sabretooth tiger . Not one , but two . Male and female . Both perfect breeding specimens . I " ve got two words for you , Niles . Impossible . You know , anyone with a chemistry degree can do cloning these days . You know , the real trick is acquiring the base material . The DNA . You see , it " s assumed that DNA is lost in fossilised material . That " s not true . We " ve succeeded . Results speak for themselves . I " ve never really liked you , Niles , but if what you " re telling me is true ... It is true . - And you can " t have it . - Well , everything " s negotiable . Like the time you tried the hostile takeover bid for my TV network . Oh , but you didn " t really want it . You just wanted to see me spend all my cash defending a takeover . But that was a business decision . It wasn " t personal . So is this . Excuse me , sir . The investors are ready to sign . - Well , find Alan . I " m busy . - I can " t find him . If you " ll excuse me . Niles , I don " t believe you have them . You " re not smart enough to pull this off . You stick around . You " ll see how smart I am . Autumn , let " s go . Time to earn your pay . So , where do you think the safe is ? Well , unless he " s had a brain transplant and expanded his mental capacity , he would normally keep them in some fake books behind his desk . Okay , stay close . Back , back , back ... Oh , God . I love somebody who " s so predictable . You can open that , right ? Please . I tell you , if Niles " brains were dynamite , he couldn " t even blow his nose . Oh , I would love to be a fly on the wall when he discovers all his research patents and secrets are all over the lnternet for free . - You really can open that , right , Autumn ? - Grant ... I " ll do the singing , you sell the orange juice . Right . Follow me . Get in there ! You close the door . Don " t go back . Hey ! It " s kind of public ... - I said it " s too public . - Okay , okay . You guys all right ? So , is that it ? Is that what ... Yeah , that " s what tore your friend " s head off back there , I think . There " s another one out there . Wait . Another one ? Bigger one . Male . Let " s go this way . Come on , follow me . Stay close . Bingo . Oh , Autumn . You are really something . All his backup data , all his files ... You know , thanks to you , everything he knows , I know . Autumn , does that look like a billion dollars to you ? Come on , darling , time to make a graceful exit . This private enough ? I gotta get out of these wet clothes . Hey , help ! Help ! Hey ! Watch where you point that thing . - Where have you been ? - A barbeque . Thank God you " re okay . Savannah " s worried sick . - She safe ? Is she all right ? - Yeah . - Who the hell are they ? - College kids . There " s little bits of one around the corner . The cats , how often do you feed them ? Once a day . About 30 , maybe 40 pounds of fresh meat . Your friend back there , what did she weigh ? What the hell kind of a question is that ? I " m just trying to help , okay ? - Anyone know how to use a gun ? - Yeah . I love guns . Please . Okay , but I have to tell you there could be more than one roaming around out there . There were two and I killed one . Unless I " m missing something . You start with two , you blow one up you end up with one . I hate to be the one to break this to you , we bred three . Three . Three . Three minus one ... Niles kept it caged in the genetic research laboratory . Something went wrong when they cloned it . It " s a giant ugly bastard . Weighs about a ton . - That " s a lot of pussy . - lt looks like your worst nightmare . The whole back half of its body is like Jell-O . Drags itself around on its front legs . It " s slow . So you won " t have any problems unless it gets you cornered at night . Wait . Wait . Wait . Go back there to the earlier bit . - Drags itself around on its front legs ? - Yeah . I can handle that . Does this have anything to do with the dead freaks in the jars ? Yes , but this one lived . I tried to warn Niles , but he wouldn " t listen . They don " t just kill to eat . We ran some tests . Turns out that the cats are bulimic . They love to eat but they can " t keep their food down . They kill , they eat , then they throw up . That explains the abnormal number of body parts . They like to kill more than they like to eat . And we know they love to eat . Here , it makes a big first impression . So do you recommend a body shot or straight to the head ? About here is a good start . All right . Follow me . Let " s go . - Feeling better ? - She " s fine . We " re leaving . But you can " t . You haven " t seen the animals in person yet . I don " t need to see them in person . There " s nothing here that interests me . We are out of here . - But you can " t . - Watch me . Autumn . - Niles . - What the hell is going on down here ? They " re getting restless . I don " t know how long I can keep them here . - There " s a dead girl down there . - What ? Pieces of her , anyway , and God knows who else . All right . All right . I " ll keep them here . You go find my cats . From the tracks that I saw , they " re headed for Area 15 . It " s warmer there . That " s where l " ll start . Grant and that little airhead , they " re running around trying to get off the island . Well , you better find them . Look , I " m so close . Let " s not throw this away . I mean , the kid ... The money I " m gonna generate , I can string a court case out for years . Damn you , Niles . They ripped a kid apart and you see it as some minor legal obstacle . I mean , don " t you care just a little ? Savannah , people paint me as a heartless bastard but I " m not . You know that . Now , this whole " kid getting ripped apart by a tiger " thing , it " ll blow over . I " m telling you , in two weeks . The media and the public , they have an attention span like that . There is a special place in hell with your name on it . Right now , I " ve got some killing of my own to do . Hold it here . Hey . I just want you to know that I don " t really think you are a bitch . Well , that really makes my day . So , can I ask you a question ? You won " t get mad ? Depends . Fair enough . What " s up with the whole Goth thing ? I mean if you want to be a non-conformist , why dress like all the other Goths ? Because even if there were no other Goths , I " d still wear black . I " d still do my makeup like this . And I " d still listen to music that I like . Not everyone in a group thinks the same . - Don " t judge me . Okay ? - Okay . Bitch . There " s something down there . If only we had power , I could see what I am doing . I have to tell you something . You know the whole power failure thing ? Kind of my fault . - I introduced a virus into the system . - Nice one , Einstein . But I think I know how to get the power back up . How ? The security room . The PC " s got backup power . If I could find a backup disc , I could reload the system . Are you nuts ? We " re not going back that way . It " s worth the risk if we can stop this now . We " d stand a better chance if the regular lighting was working . At least we " d see what we were shooting at . Brian . Brian , you tell me this whole damn mess is over . I hate to be the one to inform you , Niles , but the fat lady hasn " t sung yet . Yes , but my cats are unharmed . Nice to know your heart " s in the right place . One down , two to go . - Where " s Savannah ? That " s who I " m ... - I don " t know . Look , I pay your wages , you listen to me . You find Savannah . You find my cats and you keep them safe . Because these people are worth millions to me . Do you understand ? Millions . I don " t think you get it . It " s over . This whole thing is over . 20 feet below us is complete carnage . It looks like Baghdad . Party over . I " d give my right arm just for one employee who didn " t bitch and moan his way through the whole day . Damn it . Oh , man . - Where the hell are we going ? - Shut up . You know , Grant , I can see why you " re so loved . If I need love , I " ll buy it . Including you . Dream on , jackass . Not for all the money in the world . When we get back , perhaps I won " t even pay you . Mr Congeniality . - What the hell was that ? - lt sounded close . - Hurry it up , son . - Okay . Okay , backups . Backups . Where do they keep the backups ? Okay . Okay . Okay . - This has last week " s date on it . - Let me see . This is it . It " s working . - Sure ? - Yeah . All right . Always pays to back up . Lights go on at any ... You hear that ? - Oh , my God . - l " ve gotta admit , he " s looked better . Stop the music . Listen to me , everybody , there are some very dangerous animals that have escaped . They " ve already killed two people and they " re headed in this direction . Now , I need you to get back to your rooms immediately and lock the door . - You " re ruining me , damn you . - I haven " t started ruining you . Ladies and gentlemen , you " ve nothing to fear . Primal Park is quite safe . Please , listen . Listen . Listen to me ! Keep up , damn it . You don " t want to wind up as Cat Chow . Bitch . Keep up , damn it . You don " t want to end up as Cat Chow . No ! Savannah , no ! Damn you , Niles ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Come on . Come on . Come on ! Stop it ! I created you , stop it . Stop it ! So that " s it , right ? We got all three . Yeah ? Yeah , I toasted one of them . And I think I hit the other one in the tunnel back there . He probably crawled away to die . Oh , God ! He may have been an idiot but he didn " t deserve to die like this . Wrong place , right time . Let " s make that the end of the evil eye . Right ? Right . Grant ? Grant ? Grant ?

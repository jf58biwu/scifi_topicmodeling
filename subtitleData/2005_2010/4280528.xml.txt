 ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( BRAKES SQUEAKING ) WOMAN : Come on , Tyler . Tyler , just stop it . I haven 't got time to muck around . Tyler ! All right ! I 'll just leave you there . Is that what you want ? - If I leave you in the middle of town ? - MAN : Suzette ! Suzette , we 're going to be late . Suzette ! Stop it . You 're just looking silly . Do you want other people to see you looking silly ? If he gives you any more trouble , your dad 's going round his house to punch his face in . I 'll punch his bloody mother . You got that , David ? I 've booked the car for 7 : 30 but I might have to leave it on standby . If Baxter starts talking he never stops , so I can 't guarantee what time ... Tell you what , I 'll send you a text from the motorway . ( DOOR OPENS ) Steven , if you leave the front door open , those cats are gonna get in . Darling , don 't just stand there , you 're gonna be late . Steven ! Steven ? Stop playing games ! Get out of the way ! ( HORNS HONKING ) Oi ! I said bloody shift , man ! David ? Are you listening to me ? Mica , oi ! You two , look at me . See you , then . ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) ( SCOFFS ) And you can shut up and all . You were the one crying . You were like a baby . - I seen you . - Was not . - Was ! - Not . You two , you 're gonna be late . We 're going , look ! I 'm going round to Polly 's later . See you ! Bye ! What ? You are pushing it , you are , young man . Come on ! All right , Glyn ? What 's occurring ? I 've been watching the bay . No sea monsters ! Ah ! Still early . Anyone in ? You two having shenanigans in the dark ? Jack ? Morning ! ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) - Clear ! - Yeah . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) - And again . - Charging 200 . Clear ! ( MONITOR FLATLINING ) I think we should call it . Everyone agree ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Okay , time of death , 09 : 1 7 . Sally , I can leave it with you , yeah ? I 'll go and tell them . Sorry . We did everything we could , but he didn 't make it . Oh , that 's a shame . - It 's very sad . - Poor old Mr Williams . It 's very sad , indeed . There 'll have to be an autopsy but I 'd say his heart gave out . Brave old heart . You were neighbours , is that right ? ( SIGHS ) We live next door . He 's got no family to speak of . All on his own . We 'd just keep an eye on him , you know . Well , I 'm sure he appreciated it . If only there were more like you two in the world . ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) I know it 's an imposition , but with us being such good neighbours ... Can we see the body ? ( SIGHING ) Bless him . God rest his soul . Say , do you think we could , uh ... Just on our own ... Of course you can . Just come and find me once you 're done . And I 'm sorry for your loss . Thank you . He thought we were together , like a couple . He said , " You two . " The way he said it , huh , " You two . " Well , we are . Does it matter ? Don 't know . It 's all a bit new to me , that 's all . - Laser saw . - Thank you . ( SAW HUMMING ) Tongs . Tongs . Almost . - Got it . - Sorry , one more ... thing . - There ! - What ? ( EXHALING ) Ooh . Now , look at it . That 's not human , is it ? Does that look human ? No , it does not . It 's just a hitchhiker he picked up . Didn 't kill him . Some say they 're positively beneficial . They release endorphins into the bloodstream . He died a happy man . And I 've got Tupperware . And we 're very considerate , we don 't leave any mess . ( SIGHS ) Thank you very much . We 'll just get out of your way . Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! Whatever it was ... That was mutilation , I should report you . Then why don 't you ? Well , that thing ... What the hell was it ? That hitchhiker ? Try putting it into a report . - You 're Torchwood ? - Never heard of ' em . There are bodies going missing . How many ? This whole city talks about you . What bodies ? Where ? It started two months ago . Bodies taken down to the mortuary , then the records just stop . Five of them . Five in two months . And none of them white . One of West Indian descent , one African , three Chinese . All male . What was your name again ? Rupesh . Rupesh Patanjali . - What do you think ? - NHS . Yeah , too much red tape . Sorry , but good luck with it . Don 't ... Look ... Wait a minute ! - See you . - Sir . Oh , Christ ! - Good morning , sir . - Morning . Good morning to you , too . Colonel Oduya for you , sir . Unscheduled . I 'd remind you , you 've got a category meeting at quarter past . - You 'd better come through . - Thank you . I 'm late . I 'm sorry . Oh , my God ! I 'm really , really sorry . Good morning . - Bridget Spears . - Lois Habiba . Right . This will be your desk . Just tell me it 's something small . Tell me it 's a meteorite or a shadow on the moon . Just for once , tell me it 's easy . It might be nothing , sir . But it 's my job to inform the government , even if it turns out to be a false alarm . Then what is it ? Children , sir . It 's the children . You are going to get us killed . No , you get killed , not me . You die like a dog , like an ugly dog . Oi , Chuckle Brothers . Think I 've found something . Yeah , well , I want you to do a check on St Helen 's Hospital , specifically the morgue . Well , there 's a computer . Do it yourself . Meanwhile , I 've been getting reports of 1 7 road traffic accidents happening right across the country , all the way from Glasgow to St Ives . Is that above average ? Well , they all occurred between 8 : 40 and 8 : 41 . Seventeen road traffic accidents happening at exactly the same minute . And every single one of them involving children . That 'll be the school run . All of them were just standing in the road . Not crossing the road , just standing . I saw it myself , Jack . Two kids on Market Street . Well , they just stopped . But the accidents are just one part of the picture . Because every other child stopped at the same time . And not just in Britain . Same reports from France , 1 5 road traffic accidents . All timed around 9 : 40 . They 're an hour ahead , so it was simultaneous . All involving children ? Yeah , hold on , still cross-referencing . Here we go . Reports coming in , RTAs in Norway , Sweden , Denmark , Luxembourg . Germany , India , Egypt , Guyana . Spain , Portugal , Bosnia , Tokyo . Singapore . At 8 : 40 GMT , most of America was asleep . But even there , I 'm beginning to get reports . I think we can assume it 's all of them , sir . As far as we can tell , at 8 : 40 this morning , every single child in the world stopped . Seen anything like this before , Jack ? No way . Kids . Until we receive further information , we don 't know if it 's extraterrestrial in origin , though the United Nations have taken UNIT up to yellow alert , just in case . ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) Bloody hell . And , uh , Colonel Mace , how is he getting on ? He 's fine . Wouldn 't mind a post in Vancouver myself . - Wonderful countryside , so they say . - Nice for some . Sorry , my name 's Lois . Lois Habiba . Just started today . I 'm helping out Miss Spears while they introduce the new computer system . - Thank you . - All right . All done . What 's his uniform ? That 's not British Army , is it ? If you could start transferring the names and addresses . - You have two daughters , is that right ? - Yeah . Maybe I should get them home from school . I 'd be careful , sir . I wouldn 't do anything to draw any attention . Right now , this thing 's random enough to go unnoticed , and if anyone files a news report , we 'll be crushing it . But so far , we 're the only ones with the software clever enough to piece this all together . Well , us and Torchwood . Do you want me to talk to them ? They 're a pain in the backside , but they can be helpful . We 're on to them right now . Okay , find out anything , let me know , immediately . Of all the times for Martha Jones to go on holiday . I get Sergeant Grunt . I 'm talking to a sergeant . Don 't you dare phone her . She 's on her honeymoon . What did they say ? UNIT base in Washington has run some tests on a couple of kids , brain scans , blood sugar , checking for radiation . Nothing . IANTO : You were right , he 's back . ( LAUGHS ) I said so . Who 's back ? What 's he doing ? Waiting , just like you said . He 's been there 20 minutes . - Persistent . - Good sign . - Dogmatic . - Always a plus . Oh , Christ , never work with a couple , you two talk like twins ! Now tell me who he is . Rupesh Patanjali , he saw the hitchhiker . He 's the bodies-going-missing man . Dr Patanjali . We need a doctor . What , and you just let him follow you ? Ask about Torchwood and most people point towards the bay . Oh . You bastards . That 's exactly what you did to me the first time we met . Well , sod that ! I 'm promoting myself to recruitment officer . She 's calling us a couple now . What 's your problem ? Just saying . I hate the word " couple " . Me , too . ( DOOR OPENS ) Hey ! Rupesh , isn 't it ? Yeah . Gwen Cooper . I 'm Torchwood . Three of the bodies were Chinese . - Were they related ? - No , one was 2 7 years old . And the other two were in their fifties . But not from the same family . Bit odd , though , statistically . - In a city this small . - That 's what I thought . Mind you , nothing compared to that hitchhiker . Freak you out ? - Oh , yeah . - Yeah , me , too . Apparently , anyone could have one . - Don 't , I know . - This place ... Ever since I moved here , it 's just weird . Where you from , then ? - Me ? I 'm from Chesterfield . - Hmm . I came down here 1 8 months back . - Enjoying it ? - Very much , yeah . I bet it doesn 't pay you much , though . Not at first . Could be worse . Torchwood 's paid by the Crown . First pay cheque , I almost fell over . I had to hide it from my boyfriend , I was buying clothes , had to stash ' em under the bed . What 's it like , inside Torchwood ? I mean , what do you do ? - Why are you so interested ? - Well ... From what I 've heard , it just sounds ... I don 't know . - Exciting ? - I suppose . - Glamorous ? - No , more sort of ... The thing is , we 've all seen it now , the past few years , alien life . Even though half the world 's still denying it . For me ... ( SIGHS ) Okay . It 's the suicides . The past few years , suicide rates have doubled and that 's ever since the first alien . My first case , my first death , was a suicide . Do you know why she did it ? 'Cause she 'd written all these letters ... She 'd been a Christian all her life , and then alien life appears . She wrote this bit , she said , " It 's like science has won . " Lost her faith . More than that . She said she saw her place in the universe , and it was tiny . She died because she thought she was nothing . I went through that , even now I get terrified . But at the same time , it is brilliant . And beautiful . And completely bloody magic . It 's bigger , you know . It 's like ... It 's like the whole wide world is bigger . My life is bigger . Shit ! Sasha , love , come on . Look , I haven 't got time , I gotta be in work . Jack , get up here right now ! It 's happening again ! The children ! They 're doing it again ! Are you all right ? We 're fine , she 's just playing a game . Okay . MOTHER : Now , come on , sweetheart . People are staring at you . - ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - Sasha , stop it ! ( CHILDREN SHRIEKING ) What 's she doing ? What 's that noise ? - I don 't know . - Sasha , stop it . Sasha ! Please help her . There 's another one . It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm a doctor . ( SHRIEKING STOPS ) CHILDREN : ( IN DEEP , DISTORTED VOICES ) We . We . We . We . We . We . We . - We . - Whoa ! CHILDREN : We are . We are . We are . We are coming . We are coming . Oh , my God ! We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . Who 's got children ? Find me a kid . Find me a bloody kid , now . MAN : We are coming . He won 't stop . He keeps saying the same thing over and over . We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . - CHILDREN : We are coming . - Sasha , please ! - CHILDREN : We are coming . - Oh , my God ! CHILDREN : We are coming ! Who are you ? Who 's coming ? Come on , then . ( CHILDREN CHATTERING AND LAUGHING ) Why is that man filming us ? Are we going to be on telly ? ( EXCLAIMS HAPPILY ) ( GASPING ) You all right ? ( GASPS ) They 've found me . Gwen , I 'll get on to the Home Office , this thing 's gone public , they 're gonna need us . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Where do you think you 're going ? Um ... I don 't know . I could help . ( PAGER RINGING ) - Doing what ? - You 're bleeping . Shit , yeah . Sorry ! Whole city 's come to a standstill , they 're going to need you in AE . We 'll get back to you , I promise . What 's in there ? Big science-fiction superbase . Honestly ! See you . ( DOOR SHUTS ) ( PAGER BEEPING ) Sorry , we 've got no comment . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Can we leave it for now ? All right . He 's not seeing anyone at the moment . The Home Secretary is demanding information , sir , and if you 're liaising with UNIT ... No , I 'm sorry , I don 't know who that is . I 'm new . Anybody else , just tell them no , Bridget . No more calls . WOMAN : Bridget , sorry ... ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . You can come with them . I 'll have to abandon the press list . Can you setup an auto-reply ? You 'll have to get into my account . That 's the user name , Spears . Password , Hastings . - Capital H , rest of it lower case . - Right . Bridget , I want to see Mr Frobisher . Will you excuse me ? - Sir . - I said no one . Mr Dekker , sir . 456 . I warned you . Just tell him it 's Captain Jack Harkness , he 'll take the call . I 'm sorry , I can 't . If you could just leave a number or ... JACK : Tell him it 's Torchwood . Right , and how do you spell that ? You 're working for the Home Office and you 've never heard of Torchwood ? I 'm new , started today . Just what I need . Sorry , not your fault . ( SIGHS ) Picked a hell of a day . Listen , just tell him Torchwood . W-O-O-D . We might be able to help , okay ? - What was your name ? - Lois . Lois Habiba . Good luck to you , Lois Habiba . ( BEEPING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) Right , too many people ... ( SIREN WAILING ) Been a while since we had visitors down here . Thought you 'd forgotten about us . It 's hardly the glamorous side of Thames House , my little domain . We converted the readings onto digital years ago . But I kept the original equipment . Call it nostalgia . Then this morning , it woke up . 8 : 40 and again at 1 0 : 30 , transmitting on the 456 . ( SCREECHING OVER SPEAKER ) Just five seconds in duration , but that 's enough . What 's it saying ? Well , I think it 's a burst of compressed information . I 'm running it through the translators , it might take a while . ( SCREECHING OVER SPEAKER ) But the point is , the 456 was open . But why would they change ? ( SCOFFS ) That 's your job to find out . I 'll have to tell the Prime Minister . Elected officials ? They just come and go . The 456 was here before him and it 'll be here long after he 's gone . So will we . The civil service , John . The cockroaches of government . Have you got kids ? Too busy working . Turns out to be a godsend . So I think it 's a transmission , a pulse , a broadcast . Like the mosquito alarm , the one that only kids can hear . Something unique to prepubescence . Maybe testosterone interferes with the signal and oestrogen ... - GIRL ON SCREEN : We are coming . - Oh , no , no , no , hold on ! We 're dumbos , we 're missing the bleeding obvious here , look ! Recorded in Taiwan . Point being , anyone ? We are coming . - It 's English . - Exactly . And all the footage is the same . So every single child in the whole wide world is speaking English . So , why is that ? I guess if you scan the Earth from the outside , you 'd register English as the dominant language . Actually , that would be Chinese . Well , Mandarin . There 's about a billion people speak Mandarin , - that 's three times more than English . - GWEN : Oh , my God ! - What ? - GWEN : Okay , ready ? So , every single child in the world is talking in unison , yeah ? - BOTH : Yeah . - Every single child ... - We are coming . - ... and one man . We are coming . What the hell , who 's he ? Name 's Timothy White , he 's a patient in a psychiatric ward , the Duke of York Hospital , East Grinstead . JACK : How did you get this footage ? GWEN : Staff emailed it to the police . Well , every police force is swamped with mums and dads going absolutely mental . So it was just waiting in line . I reckon no one else has noticed him yet . East Grinstead . - That 's what , two hours ? - I 'm on it . GWEN ON PHONE : I know I promised . shut up . Change of plan . Oh , it 's all right . I thought you 'd be busy . ( CHUCKLES ) " We are coming ! " Eh , but what 's it like ? The estate agent hasn 't turned up . Ah , fair do 's , she 's probably got kids . - So , what do you think 's causing it ? - Ah , I can 't say . Top secret . - You haven 't got a clue , have you ? - No idea . Tell you what , looks nice from the outside . I reckon we could knock 1 0 grand off the asking price . Three bedrooms , one could be a nursery . - Oh , stop it . - Well , one day . You can , uh , adopt a Filipino and get her to clean the chimneys . Thing is , I was thinking though , right , those kids went off at 8 : 40 , when everyone 's on their way to school , then at 1 0 : 30 , that 's break time . It 's like it was timed , you know ? So you 'd get maximum kids out in the open , visible to everyone . I suppose . RHYS : Yeah , but that means it 's timed around Britain . Specific British hours , yeah ? It might be worldwide , but I reckon someone 's looking right at us . That 's brilliant . That is brilliant . You 're not bad , you , are you ? - I 'm bloody superb . - Oh , my God ! Severn Bridge ! I 'm going into England . Farewell forever . Good luck . Have you got currency ? Yes , and I 've had my injections . See you ! Lunchtime . This place should be buzzing with kids . - Everyone 's taken them home . - We need a child . 'Cause we need to test those frequencies . Find the right frequency and we can find out who 's transmitting . Where do you get a child , though ? I can find you lasers and Weevils , hitchhikers . But kids ... See you later . Where are you going ? Now who 's a couple ? ( BIG BEN CHIMING ) When I was a kid , it was the bomb . Iron Curtain , Reds under the bed , it was all so bloody simple . Now it comes raining down from the skies , made of metal , stinking green and God knows what . I find myself running a country under siege from above . - What do you recommend that we do ? - You tell me . Given that this is now worldwide , Prime Minister , it might be best if certain ... historical events were taken off the record . - So Britain gets a clean sheet ? - Yes , sir . How do we know if these ... What do we call them ? The 456 , they never gave a name . We just called them the 456 after the frequency allocation . Well , how do we know that the 456 will keep quiet ? We don 't . All we can do is hope to cover ourselves . ( SIGHS ) You 'll have to issue a Blank Page . No . Then , what do we do ? I 'm not having my name on this . You never told me . I was never a part of it . I never knew . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Then I take it that that ... leaves the Blank Page with me ? Just don 't tell me about it . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Darling , it 's in the bottom drawer . I put them there yesterday , yeah ? Ah , I thought so . Good to see you . How 's things ? - Terrifying . - Uncle Jack ! Steven ! Hey , soldier ! How you doing ? I was talking like an alien , everyone was ! - It was brilliant ! - You 'd better come in . ( CAR LOCK BEEPS ) ( VIDEO GAME BLARING ) Only me . Oh , bloody hell ! We must be in trouble . - Or is it Christmas ? - How are they ? Yeah , it was a bit of a scare . I brought ' em home , just in case . But I reckon it 's that group hysteria thing . Like when lots of girls all faint at the same time . - Did you say thanks to your uncle ? - I did . David , your uncle Ianto 's here ! I was thinking I missed Mica 's birthday , thought I could take her to McDonald 's or something . That 's all of L3.95 , you big spender . - All right , cinema . - Yeah , that 'd be nice . You 'd like that wouldn 't you , Mica ? I thought maybe this afternoon ? No chance . What about Saturday ? I 'm kind of busy on Saturday . You 're a civil servant . They don 't work weekends , they invented weekends . And I 'm not having her going out . Not today , not with all that voice thing . I want ' em where I can see ' em . - She 'll be with me . - She 's staying put . Right , fine . Just an idea . I won 't bother you . Oh , that 's it , is it ? You 're just going to go now . Oh , sit down , you daft sod . I got some of that spinach dip . And you and me , well ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) We got things to talk about . - What things ? - You 've been seen . It said on the news that we should send them back to school tomorrow . Do you think it 's safe ? Well , I don 't know any more than you . - Oh , come on . - I don 't ! Any word from Joe ? In Italy , with her . They finally got married . He , uh ... He phones every now and then and sends Steven postcards , remembers his birthday . There are worse fathers . How are you off for money ? Don 't worry about that , you give me enough . Kind of easy writing cheques , huh ? Alice , you 're the one who asked me to stay away . I 'd come round here every week if you wanted me to ... Every day . Yeah . I just can 't stand it , Dad . I look older than you do and it 's never gonna stop . I get older and older and you stay the same . One day , you 're gonna be standing at my funeral , looking just like you did when you were standing at Mum 's . No wonder she was so furious . You make us feel old . Actually , I found a grey hair . ( LAUGHS ) Oh , well , that is the end of the world . ( CHUCKLES ) You ever going to tell him ? What do I say , that you 're his grandfather ? Well , he 's too young to notice right now that I don 't age . But one day he 's gonna realise ... And that 's another good reason for you to stay away . I suppose . I could make the most of it while he 's still young . Take him out , buy him stuff . Me and him sort of thing . You mean today ? While I 'm here , may as well . Oh , you bastard . Something happens to the kids , and you want to spend time with him on the same day . You are not experimenting on that boy , Dad , not ever . That 's why I want you to stay away , because you 're dangerous . ( PAGER BEEPING ) Dr Patanjali , you were paging me ? Rupesh , Captain Jack Harkness . You 've got a children 's ward , haven 't you ? I need a kid . Susan on the corner was in town and it was their anniversary . So they went to that posh French place in town , by the memorial . And there was you . So ... There was you , having dinner with a man . So ? Having dinner with a man , in a restaurant . - So ? You have dinner with Tina . - Not in town . Susan said he was gorgeous . Like a film star . - Like an escort . - He 's my boss . Well , she said it was intimate . I said , " Well , he 's had girlfriends . " And she said , " Well , no girl was getting her feet round that table . " No chance . " Have you gone bender ? Mica 's hearing this . She 's not bothered . Her friend Sian 's got two mothers . Go on . You never tell me anything these days . Dad died , that was it . You were off , you couldn 't wait . Like I did something wrong . I didn 't , did I ? It 's not that . It 's my job . It 's difficult . It 's ... ( SIGHS ) He is very handsome . - No ! - Now , stop it . You 're kidding me ! Really , though ? Really ... Christ almighty . He 's nice , though , is he ? Is he ? Oh , my ... I mean , since when ? It 's weird . It 's just different . It 's not men , it 's ... It 's just him . It 's only him . And I don 't even know what it is , really , so ... So , no broadcasting it . Oh , no , honest . I won 't say . If you want it kept quiet ... ( DOOR SHUTS ) I swear , I won 't say a word , I promise . Aye , aye , gay boy . She says you 're taking it up the arse . Mica , will you get off that thing ? Thanks . How have you been , then , you smart bastard ? ( LAUGHING DELIGHTEDLY ) ( CAR ALARM RINGING ) Hey , who 's car is that outside , is that you ? Black thing . Oh , that 's the company car . You want to watch it on this estate , boy . No , it 's fine , top of the rain . it 's got a triple deadlock . Oh , aye , sounds like it . ( CAR ENGINE REVVING ) Oh ! But it 's got a triple deadlock , they can 't have ! No , ' cause what they do is , see , they drive round the block , then come back for a lap of honour . The victory parade , we get ' em . - We should phone the police . - No , it 's more fun this way . Right , here they come , get ready . ( HONKING ) ( MEN EXCLAIMING ) ( SHOUTING ) David , get inside now ! That 's my car ! Close the window , I 'm not telling you again ! Get inside ! I 'll take your computer off you , get in . That 's my car . Timothy White , 52 years old , he 's been with us three months . But he 's got a history of being in and out of care all his life . Timothy White 's , my mum used to shop there . Well , if he 's got a different name , he 's never said . He spent 40 years living in Leeds . That 's where he first came on record . Found homeless , living on the streets at the age of 1 1 . 1 1 ? Bloody hell . No one ever reported him missing . Apparently , though , he did have a Scottish accent back then . Gone now , but ... ( SIGHS ) He was a long way lost . GWEN : Can you remember the voice ? You said , " We are coming . " Can you remember why ? Do you know what I think it was ? Aliens . There 's no such thing . Those days are gone . I don 't mean to scare you because you 're perfectly safe , but I think aliens are using you to speak . What do you think ? No such thing . Isn 't it , isn 't it ? I 've met aliens . It 's part of my job . But I 'm not the authorities or the police or the army , so anything you say is just between me and you and I will believe you . ( INHALES ) Give me your hand . ( SNIFFING ) You 're telling the truth . - How can you tell ? - I can smell it . You 've ... met them ? Dozens of them . Still not safe . Isn 't it , isn 't it ? They 're watching . Well , I can do something about that . Shh , shh . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) What 's that thing ? The technical name is a gizmo . ( LAUGHING ) Isn 't it ? I think you 've seen aliens , too . What 's your name ? What 's your real name ? When did you last say your name ? - Never . - Then tell me . I was a kid . What happened ? They ... They took us out , in the night , in the dark . Isn 't it , isn 't it ? They told us ... They said we were going to a new home . Who did ? Who said ? The staff . A care home ? ( GASPING ) They ... drove us away for miles and miles . ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) They were there , in the sky . What did they look like ? Light . The light ... took them . GWEN : Took who ? My friends . But not you . I ran . Hmm . There was something , there were people , there was ... Isn 't it , isn 't it , isn 't it , isn 't it ... ( GWEN SHUSHING ) You 're all right . You 're safe , okay ? You 're safe now . ( CATCHES BREATH ) But they 're coming back . I 've been smelling them for months . ( SNIFFS ) In the air . - Long time coming . - Tim , I can help . Look at me , I can help . If kids went missing , something 's gotta be written down and I will find it . But to do that , I need to know your name . I was Clem . Clement McDonald . Hi , Clem . Hi . Where were you from ? It was somewhere in Scotland , do you remember ? Holly Tree . Holly Tree . Now , then , is that a town or a place or ... The Holly Tree . The Holly Tree , is that where it happened , Clem , is it ? What was the Holly Tree ? What was the Holly Tree ? ( SNIFFING ) You 're pregnant . - Sorry ? - Yes , you are . No , I don 't think so . Yes , I can smell it . Three weeks . NURSE : Oh ! Bloody hell , I 've been running . That camera 's gone off . It just went dead . Still , no harm done , eh ? Is everything all right ? Yes , I 'm fine , thank you . Well , I think we 've had long enough . Time for your meds , isn 't it , Tim ? - If you don 't mind ? - No , not at all . Congratulations . Ianto , I need a search on Clement McDonald . It could be M-C or M-A-C . And try the words " Holly Tree " and " Scotland " . GWEN : We 're looking at the 1 960s . Got that ? Yup . Then try the words Timothy White , with the option of Timothy White 's , apostrophe S , like the shop . I lost the car . Yeah , and if you find anything let me know straight away . Don 't wait for me to get back . These kids nicked it . Yeah , see you later . ( SIGHS ) I 've got a red flag on a Torchwood intercept . The name Clement McDonald . Can you trace it ? MAN OVER PA : Roger , Ashton , Control initiating trace now . You 'll find the names under 456 . And what do you want me to do ? ( HONKS ) I promise , we can zap these kid 's memories so they won 't remember a thing . No side effects . Look , there 's been another death . Mr Chow Lee Jee , Chinese again . He came in with a nosebleed that wouldn 't stop . Next thing you know , it 's been diagnosed as a brain haemorrhage . He died at 1 6 : 25 . Sorry , he 's with me . Dr Patanjali , AE . We just need to check Mr Chow Lee Jee . - Well , he hasn 't gone missing . - I can see that . Need to run a toxicology scan , not on the NHS , we 've got much better equipment . Pupils blown . That corresponds with a brain haemorrhage , though it could be induced artificially . No sign of trauma to the skin apart from bruising but that 's ... ( GUNSHOT FIRES ) ( GROANS ) ( PANTING ) Get them in . Seal off the area . Permission to move out . The name Clement McDonald hasn 't been active for 44 years . Here he is .

It was perfect timing , he just fitted the story . Then get off your high horse , yeah ? Any sign yet ? Not so far . Do you think it 's true ? What they say about him ? ( GASPING ) ( GROANS ) - He was dead . - Now he 's dead again . And we 'll keep killing him till he 's ready . - Get him prepared . - Yes , ma 'am . How the hell does he do it ?

( GROANS ) ( GASPS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Oh , no . IANTO : Result ! There was a Holly Tree Lodge just outside Arbroath . It 's a hotel now , but up until 1 965 it was a state-run orphanage .

Five to Control , Harkness now approaching door one , over . He 's inside . We don 't know how deep that place goes , give it five . Over . We need damage control at St Helen 's . One body , Dr Rupesh Patanjali , shot in the back . - What happened ? - ( SIGHS ) I don 't know . He was just left there right beside me , like someone 's gloating . Did they kill you ? Yeah . Maybe we we 're being targeted . Whether it 's him or me , we should be careful . Better tell Gwen . She 's back , she 's in the lab . Gwen ! Boy , have I had a day .

Ianto , we 're having a baby . You told Rhys ? I 've only just found out myself . Oh , you told me before you told him , he is gonna love that . ( GIGGLES NERVOUSLY ) Congratulations . Would now be a good time to tell you I lost the car ? You did what ? That is just bloody spectacular ! But what about this place and my job ? We 'll manage . We always do . ( ALARM BLARING ) What the hell is that ? Oh , my God ! It 's a bomb . There 's a bomb inside your stomach . - Get out , both of you , right now ! - No , no ! Blast radius , one mile .

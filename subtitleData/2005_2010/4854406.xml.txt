 The body was found here by Pierre Seven . Police are canvassing the area . No witnesses have come forward at this time . And authorities are baffled by what appears to be one of the most gruesome murders in Boston 's history . The media has been blocked from the immediate crime scene and all we could cope was that a body was found mutilated by what might have been a hunting knife . Police are with-holding the name of the victim until their family can be contacted . There are a number of nightclubs around here that 's not the safest neighbourhood , but there haven 't been violent crimes of this nature before . Until someone with information comes forward , police have no clues at this bizzare murder that had occured here tonight . Hello , beautiful . Finally . Where you 've been ? Did you get my message ? I did . But you didn 't call me back . No , I thought I 'd call you later . I was at a conference . Where were you last night , Bob ? Where would I be ? I was at home , I was catching up on my sleep . But I called . You know I turn off the phone to get some sleep . Come on , now , you 're starting to go down that road again . Before you know it , you 'll be all upset . I think this has more to do with the miles between us , all that dreary weather you 're having in Portland . You 'll feel much better when you get back tomorrow . Hey , we 'll , uh , we 'll do something nice . In fact , we 'll stay in . I 'll cook for us . I 'd like that , Bob . Listen , love , I 'll call you when I get home tonight . Right now I 've gotta go have dinner with these insufferable suits from Hong Kong . I hope it won 't be too awful . You never can tell . Bye . You know what 's funny ... Before I came in here , I thought I was good-looking . Seriously , though , I can tell you 're my type of girl . How do you know ? I know these things . Cheers , mate . I can tell you 're my kind of girl . S01E18 : Midnight Oh , Olivia , you have to hear how Neal and Helen met . This could be good for my sister . We 're both single ... Uh , we 're in our thirties , hadn 't met anyone . We wanted to have kids . Then I heard about this program called Two Singles Together . Two Singles Together was the answer for us . I 'm sorry , Two- - - Two Singles Together . - Two Singles Together . It 's a matchmaking service . Not just a matchmaking service , Rachel . A way of life . Two Singles Together ? Uh , I have my own schedule . Works for me . I have no interest in controlling Neil 's , either . I like vacations in the sun and- - I like the snow . Doesn 't that kind of defeat the purpose of being in a relationship ? Well , I 'm- - There are things we agree on , of course . Like , um ... Where to live . - Yeah . - The appropriate kindergarten . Friends we both enjoy . Which , incidentally , I want to make sure Ella can attend Graham 's birthday party . Oh , I already R.S.V.P. ' d on the class sign up . And , uh , that was for Neil 's rock climbing party for Graham . My party for Graham is the following Saturday . We are doing science center . Excuse me for one minute . Oh , thanks Olivia . I think you have ... What ? Greg 's filing for divorce . Oh , Rach . Not now . Not in front of them . They 'll make me join Two Singles Together . Um , okay . Where were we ? I 'm sorry , I 've just been called into work . Oh , what kind of work do you do , Olivia ? Think his name was Bob Dart . He was 33 years old . His girlfriend . Got back from a business trip in Portland . Couldn 't reach him . She found him here . We confirmed the trip . No forced entry . No witnesses . So this matched the victim that Boston P.D. found two nights ago at the Pier ? The one that 's been all over the news ? Yeah , they don 't know what to make of it . So now they have another one . Now it 's ours to mix up . You know what this reminds me of , Peter ? Nope , but I 'm gonna guess it 's something unbelievably disgusting . Shrimp cocktail . You see , the shrimp must be deveined by putting a shallow cut down the back ... To expose the vein . Which , in fact , is not a vein at all , but the crustaceans intestinal tract . Great , thanks for that . Another foodstuff I can cross off the menu for life . Hey , you okay ? Why ? Well , you were awfully quiet on the car ride over here and you just don 't seem your normal , chipper self at a bloody , gruesome crime scene . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm , um ... It 's just home stuff . Well , I know from home stuff . I live with a guy who 's inspecting a severed spine . This is fascinating . These appear to be bite marks . See how the flesh is ripped and jagged markings . Canine or even ursine , but human . You 're suggesting that someone chewed his spine out ? Yes . But with a jaw strength . Well in excess of that of a normal human being . Great , well , maybe we 're looking for Dracula . Finally , son , you 're opening your mind to new possibilities . But , no ... There are no vampires , sadly . But it 'll be something exciting , I 'm sure . We have another monster on the loose ? Uh , no , sir . Walter says that the teeth marks are definitely human . I can just about remember when a suspect being human was a given , not an option . Bob Dunn 's girlfriend said that he had a car , an Audi A-4 . It wasn 't in the garage , and we couldn 't find it when we did a two-block sweep . Local P.D. is on it . Yeah , we could get lucky . Maybe the killer took it . And Dr. Bishop ? He 's at the lab with both bodies , doing autopsies . Okay ... Well , let me know if you learn anything . Is there something else ? This may sound impolitic , sir , but ... I was wondering if you were satisfied with your divorce attorney . I 've heard you talking on the phone to your kids , but never to your wife . I was satisfied . Except for the bill . I was wondering if I might be able to get the name and number . It should be waiting in your inbox . Thank you . I hope things work out for your sister . I pay attention too , Agent Dunham . The C-1 cervical vertebrae is connected to the C-2 cervical vertebrae . C-2 cervical vertebrae is connected to the - C-3 cervical verterbrae . - Look , Walter ... That 's enough . When you finally meet a nice girl , I would avoid bringing her home for as long as possible . Walter , this is the lab work you requested on the victims . Excellent . It may help us understand why their spinal columns have been completely drained of spinal fluid . The killer took the victims - spinal fluid ? - Hmm . Why would they do that ? Where would the fun be if we already knew all there is to know ? This is interesting . Traces of treponema pallidum . That 's the syphilis bacteria . On the victim 's neck and back . Most likely from the killer 's saliva . So the killer has syphilis . - Seems so . - Great . Should have worn gloves . And what 's even more fascinating ... This particular strain of syphilis is extinct . Has been for decades . Well , how could the killer be exposed to an extinct strain of syphilis ? See , isn 't this fun ? I appreciate the CDC 's prompt response on this matter . Of course . I ran an index search . A sample of that particular strain of syphilis was shipped out four weeks ago to a Lubov Pharmaceuticals . They have a local address on Brighton . Well , thank you , but a phone call would have sufficed . Actually , I 'm not sure that it would have . Because their address is on a residential area , I took the liberty of running the rest of Lubov 's research requests over the past few years . This isn 't the first contagion they 've ordered from us . In fact , there have been quite a few . We need to show this to Broyles . Any reputable scientist with the appropriate credentials can procure samples of bacteria and viruses for their research . In addition to the extinct syphilis bacteria , Lubov Pharmaceuticals also procured a sample of a substance called RUD-390 . Which is ... A chemical compound used in the construction of bioweapons . You 're suggesting whoever 's behind these killings may also be planning a biological attack ? Or has before . RUD-390 was one of the components of the rapid skin growth toxin that killed Agent Kent . You 're saying this is Z.F.T. ? Z.F.T. ? What 's that ? We believe Z.F.T. is a terrorist organization ... Responsible for a number of bio attacks in the last year . I see . Why ? What is their agenda ? That 's what we wanna find out . Assemble an assault squad . - Move on Lubov . - Yes , sir . Federal agents . You 're under arrest . Dr. Nicholas Boone . Advanced degrees in hematology and biochemistry . Founder of Lubov Pharmaceuticals , a multinational biotech firm whose corporate offices turn out to be in a split level ... In Brighton . Now we know that there 's a strain of syphilis that you ordered was found on his spine . Can 't you see these ? They 're human bite marks . What is out there doing this ? What happened to these people ? How long have you been a follower of Z.F.T. ? That 's right , Dr. Boone . We know about Z.F.T. What do you know ? Enough to know that they 're using the world as a testing ground for experiments . We want to know more about David Robert Jones , about who funds Z.F.T. and why . We want to know what we 're dealing with . I don 't have to spell it out for you , Dr. Boone . You talk to us , give us information . Help us with whatever 's out there killing people . It 'll go better for you . What is doing this ? What have you done ? - Someone was dosed . - With what ? Dosed with what ? ! I know a lot about the things you want . And more . And I 'll answer your questions . But you have to help me first . Help with what ? They have my wife . I want you to get her back . Z.F.T. has your wife ? Agent Dunham ... What counts with punishment is the ability to know whom to hurt , and when . You 're telling me Z.F.T. ' s coercing you ... To conduct these experiments by threatening to harm your wife . Why would they be punishing you ? Because when I realized what my work was being used for , I tried to get out . I 'll tell you everything you want to know . But first , you have to get my wife back . Do you believe him ? I don 't . Boone 's wife is a nurse . I checked with her hospital , and she hasn 't been to work in three weeks . Proves nothing . I 'm inclined to agree with Agent Francis . Everything we know about these guys Suggests that they 're Zealots . Why don 't we go back in there ; ask them why the sudden change of heart ? We can 't ask him a thing until we get his wife . - Could be a trap . - Could be the truth . I 'm sorry , but since I 've been working in Fringe Division , 81 people have lost their lives . And that 's not including the 147 on Flight 627 . In my entire career , only nine people have died on cases that I worked . This is the closest that we 've ever come to getting traction and stopping these people . Getting a handle on Z.F.T. , Jones ... Or more . This guy could be our chance . What is it ? The address Boone gave us , where he says they 're holding his wife . It 's a restaurant ... in Chinatown . Doesn 't exactly scream Z.F.T. hive of activity . They 've been tagged right at us . Meaning ? They 're burning five times more power a month than they should making moo shoo pork . They could be using the power for something else . Maybe to facilitate a laboratory ? This could be our chance to get to Z.F.T. Go , get ' em . I 'll get it teamed together . Peter and Walter Bishop . We 're here to catalog the chemical evidence . Walter Bishop , nice to meet you . Hello . Um ... Hello , please . Uh , Bishop , Walter Bishop . Walter , you don 't have to shake everybody 's hand . He gets a little nervous around authority figures . Oh , boy . Look at that . Benzyl alcohol . Colorless liquid used as a bacteriostatic in solutions for injection , topically as a local anaesthetic . Personally , I 'd like to use it as a mouth wash . What did this guy create ? From what I 've seen so far , I am forming a hypothesis . Would you care to hear it ? Well , I don 't know . Would I ever be able to sleep at night again ? Well , that depends . Depends on what ? On whether the light is on or not . There 's four exits . Risk and Walken , you take the rear . Taub and Brown , you take the side . Dunham and I are gonna be in the front with the rest of you . And remember , this is a hostile situation in a contained environment . So retrieving the hostage unharmed is our top priority . - Yes , ma 'am . - Dunham . Greg wants full custody of Ella . What ? Another process server just came by . Greg is claiming that I am an unfit parent . That " the minor 's mental and physical well-being would be " best served under the ... " sole custody of the petitioner . " He can 't be serious . I won 't let that happen , Liv . I will run if I have to . I will take her and I will disappear , I swear to God . Okay , Rachel , Rachel ... Just calm down . You 're not running anywhere , and you 're not gonna lose Ella . He 's just doing this to hurt me . Okay , Rachel , listen to me . Now , this is just one of those things that you 're gonna look back on and you 're gonna say , " I beat that too . " Do you hear me ? I hear you . Okay . So , um , look , let 's talk when I get home . I-I 've got a ... I gotta go to a meeting . Okay . Ahem . We got that meeting . Freeze ! Stay where you are ! - F.B.I. ! - Get your ass on the floor ! - Clear ? - Clear . Uhh ! Uhh ! Huh ? Your wife isn 't there . I know that . I need to talk to Agent Dunham . Dunham . I 'm putting him on . Agent Dunham . What the hell 's going on ? There 's a room in the back . Can you see it ? Yeah , we checked . She 's not there . I know , but what I need is . Okay , I 'm here . In front of you , you should see a row of refrigeration units . Third from the right . Yeah , I see it . Open it . You know , I 'm not gonna do a thing until you tell me why we 're here . We 're getting to that . No , you tell me now . Inside that cooling unit you 'll find a contagion , five vials marked XT-43 . The person who 's out there killing has been dosed with this . I need it to make an antidote . You lied to me ? No . Agent Dunham ... They didn 't kidnap my wife . They infected her . That was my punishment for trying to leave Z.F.T. It 's she who 's out there killing . Valerie Boone . Valerie Boone , you turn March into June . - Alright . - Okay , that 's enough . You ... You be on camera . - I always do this . - No . I have no interest in being on camera . - Come on , you . - We 'll both ... Are we both in ? Okay , that 's me . - Hi ! - Hello . Us in the park ! You are so beautiful . You are really warm . You 're burning up . What- - What 's wrong ? You 're my kind of guy . I 'm sorry . Dunham . Charlie 's running a background check on the body he found on the Mustang . Peter said that you had something I should see . We found this at Boone 's house . You wanna pay specific attention to the date . Ahh ... Whoever wore a lab coat and rubber gloves . Valerie Boone . Valerie Boone , you turn March into June . Okay , that 's enough . You-you be on camera . - I have no- - - I always do this . I have no interest in being on camera . - Come on , you- - - Okay , we 'll both ... All right . - Hi . - Hello . Us in the park ! Where is- - Okay . Look out . Okay . - Okay . - There , okay , that 's it . No , no , no ! That 's not it . There he goes . Oh , my God , you look like you ran in the trash can . That video was taken three weeks ago , Dr. Boone . Can you explain to me why you are in a wheelchair today ? She needs to feed . She can 't control it . I began to feed her my own spinal fluid . The more I gave , the more she craved , until ... I couldn 't give anymore . The contagion burns through her spinal fluid faster than her body can replace it . When she kills , it 's simply to ... Refuel . I tried to synthesize the antidote on my own , watching her suffer the effects of being infected . But I couldn 't do it . Not without a dose of the bacteria to work from . For the rest of my life , this chair will remind me of what I 've done . Why would Z.F.T. want you to create something like this ? To create a human nightmare . The syphilis was just a platform . Carrier for other attributes . Attributes that changed her . For what purpose ? For the same reason they asked me to ... create the skin growth toxin ... To show off . To who ? Other scientists . You mean nothing to them . So how many vials were created ? Just the ones that I took ? I made six , now accounted for , but I can 't guarantee they won 't pick up where I left off . If they did figure out how to make it , could they weaponize this bacteria ? You really don 't know who you 're dealing with . The answer for both of us is to let me make a cure . Now that you 've recovered the dose samples , I can make it . My offer still stands . I 'll tell you everything I know when you find her . If the cure works , we both win . Now I 'll need access to a lab with a blood analyzer . I 'll also need a spectroscope and a centrifuge . You might want to write this down . That won 't be a problem . You really think it 's a good idea to let him have free reign in Walter 's believe-it-or-not emporium ? Oh , and this is something my son Peter is working on . I haven 't got the faintest idea what it is . Your centrifuge is 20 years old . Oh , 25 . It 's an oldie , but a goody . I also have a cow . And , just for the record , one mad scientist is my limit . I think that having him help Walter is our best chance at saving lives . - Dunham . - It 's Charlie . We found Bob Dunn 's missing car . Where ? Clear across town , in Mission Hill . It 's completely stripped . Quarter panels , radio , everything . - The GPS ? - No , it 's gone . We got no way to track where he picked up Boone 's wife . Okay , thanks , Charlie . Uh , good news , Peter . Nicholas and I are in agreement about this penicillin . Yes , we need to purify the mould , then ferment it . To the highest possible concentration . Agent Farnsworth , we 're going to need a rat . Can you , uh , call me if something else turns up ? Okay , bye . Great news . They made a breakthrough . They 're gonna fight the super syphilis with super penicillin . Syphilis was the platform . If they can kill the syphilis , they can stop the contagion . They did the same thing once against super pneumonia . Right . Well , Charlie just found Dunn 's car , stripped in Mission Hill . Excellent . He check the GPS ? Stolen . Well , everything stolen is not necessarily lost . Meaning what ? Meaning if there 's a car found stripped in the Greater Boston area , I can guarantee you my man Mako has his big toe in it . Oh , you have a friend who runs a chop shop ? Yeah . You make that sound so illegal . Dunham . Let 's just say the GPS is here , allegedly . But it 's useless because it 's been wiped for resale . Hypothetically . We 're trying to track a killer , Mr. Mako . Nah , it 's just Mako . You know , like " Cher . " Theoretically , if the GPS is wiped , then that would put you in a rough spot , because you 'd be hampering a federal investigation . I 'm trying to work with you here . We need the GPS to find out where the victim was the night of his killing . But you stole his car from his home in Brookline . I didn 't steal his car from Brookline . Where 'd you steal it from ? If I tell you where we boosted that car , can we just say that this conversation never happened ? Hypothetically ? Sure . Route 18th , Weymouth . By the water . Fascinating . 105 degrees . Then the rat 's successfully infected . This strain of syphilis raises the body temperature well above normal . The cure is nearly complete . Once this penicillin concentrates , we can test it on the rat . Where did you study , Nicholas ? At the Curie Institute in Paris . Kings College , Aberdeen , Scotland . It 's quite a fall . It 's an honor to have your intellect in my lab . That 's high praise . Because I know very well who you are . Well ... That makes one of us . A little memory loss is often kind to the soul . That a figure of speech ? Or do you believe there is such a thing ? The soul . There are days when I wish I did . There are days when I wish I didn 't . I-I often wake up at night , frightened , with the understanding that there are things man shouldn 't know . That the scientific trespasses I 've committed- - Will one day be judged . Belly and I would often debate this very thing . William Bell . You 've heard of him ? Of course . Founder of Massive Dynamic . Richest man in the world . We used to share a lab . Quite a fall . Hmm . If indeed there is a soul , we must consider then that there is still time for redemption . We 're not being hauled off to be judged yet , Nicholas . This must be where Mako boosted the car . All the shattered glass . So we 're thinking what ? Boone 's wife kills this guy , steals his car , and then drives it out here ? Yeah . But what was she doing here ? And where did she go ? You know what I hate worst than the cold ? What ? Not much . Olivia ... Think I know why she came out here . The camera , aspirin . Okay . Ready . Ahem . We are about to inject the infected rat with an antidote . Should it prove effective , it will no doubt work on humans as well . Nicholas . Now we wait . Ah ! Marvelous . You can bring the bodies right this way , gentlemen . We 've been expecting you . Right over here is fine . May I offer you a peak freen ? A delicious vanilla wafer with raspberry center and lemon cream . He doesn 't want a cookie , Walter . Uh ... Apparently , you 're wrong . That 's two more bodies . One we found in the forest in Weymouth . The other on the street in Roxbury . Where is she getting her victims ? You must have some idea where she 'd go . The person out there killing people is not thinking like my wife . Well , she wouldn 't recognize me ... Let alone find comfort in places she knows . This one 's been drinking . He smells like a brewery . Hey , Peter , will you turn out the lights ? Seriously ? Oh ! All right , Peter . I ordered it on television . It 's an entry stamp . He 's got the same one . It 's a place called the Cavern . Industrial area is really happening in the underground club scene right now . So she 's going to the club to find these victims . Look , I need more time to make the cure . Please . If you take her alive , I know I can save her . I 'll see what I can do . Dunham , FBI . Him too , he 's with me . Now you 're my kind of guy . What is that ? It 's a hand-held thermal imaging radiometer . It tells me if you 're hot . So ... So you 're definitely hot . But ... I 'm looking for someone with syphilis . Uh , okay . I don 't understand . Something 's wrong . Something 's missing . The rat 's body has rejected the cure . Perhaps a protein incompatibility . No , it 's not that . I know what 's wrong . The contagion required cerebral spinal fluid ... as a catalyst . And the cure must require some as well . Bond the cure to the contagion . Yes , and the only spinal fluid we know for a fact is compatible ... is my own . Well , no , that 's out of the question . It 's too dangerous . If you lose more spinal fluid , it could cause a brain haemorrhage . No , I was very careful to monitor the amount of fluid I removed . Another 25 milliliters should be safe . Walter ... We can 't . We have no other choice ! Walter ? Prep the table , Agent Farnsworth . Thank you . Anything ? No , not yet . I got her . She 's moving along the back walk . Peter , I can 't find her . She was right there , but she 's gone now . Okay ... Um ... Alright , keep looking . I 'm gonna check in with Charlie . Hey , Charlie ? We had her , but we lost her . You got the exit ? Nobody is leaving yet . She 's still in there with you , Liv . You prepare the spinal fluid , Agent Farnsworth . Come on up . Here we go . Gently . Okay , gently , gently , gently . - Alright . - Yes , thanks . Charlie ... Yeah , Charlie , I think she 's headed to you . What 's she wearing ? Black dress ... and freakishly blue eyes . On it . Valerie Boone ? Are you Valerie Boone ? It 's her . Take her down . Alright , we got her . - Clear the area . - You just shot that woman ! I just got off the phone with Olivia . Good news , Dr. Boone . They have her . Oh , excellent ! Dr. Boone ? - Walter ... - Hmm ? Get me a TPA injection . You lied to me . You let me take too much spinal fluid . How far would you go for someone you love ? Unh ! How 's she doing ? She 's going to be out for hours . Where 's the siren on this thing ? There . Is that why you wanted to drive ? Everybody should get to do this at least once before they die . That looks says more than just , " I wish I hadn 't have let him drive . " I was just thinking about Nicholas Boone and what he did for his wife . What he is doing . Geez , that kind of love . Greg asked Rachel for a divorce , and now he 's fighting her for custody . You know , I never liked that guy . You 've never met Greg . Yeah , but I met your sister . So I know she deserves better . And I thought you were a card-carrying cynic . I am , world class . But there 's an argument to be made that beneath every cynic , there is a frustrated romantic . Agh ! Uhh ! Ohh ! Peter ! Peter , my tranq gun . Uhh ! Thank you . I think she liked you . Good . Bring her in , strap her down . Walter , what happened ? He had a stroke . - Pulse is strong . - Yeah , so is she . Agent Farnsworth , 30CCs of the antidote , please . Peter . Thank you . You 're welcome . Okay , now what ? Now , we wait . Uhh ! Walter ... No ! Let her ! Is she ... Seems to be working . Agent Farnsworth ... Prepare a solution , 30 parts saline . And some adrenaline and perhaps a cup of coffee . Walter . Hmm ? He 's gone . Dr. Boone asked me to give this to you personally , Agent Dunham . What is it , Walter ? Agent Dunham , if you 're watching this , I suspect I didn 't make it . But you and I had a bargain , and , uh , you held up your end . Now , I have made many mistakes in my life , But ... in the end , I should at least be a man of my word . And I promised you answers . With any luck , you will use them to rectify some of my misdeeds . Now , in the time I worked with Z.F.T. , I never dealt with anyone of significant rank within the movement . But I was able to gather some names . Including some I suspect you 've already heard of . Dunham . Hey . Are you all right ? Yeah . Uh , Nicholas Boone talked . He told us everything he knew about Z.F.T. Did he mention David Robert Jones ? No , he said he 'd never heard of him . But he did mention another name that we 've heard before . According to Boone , the man who 's funding Z.F.T ... is William Bell .

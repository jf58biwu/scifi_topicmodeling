 Jack ? Abby ? What are you doing here ? Zoe . That 's my mom . I asked you to wait . Has she spoken to you ? What ? You told her . No , jack . This is so like you ! I don 't wanna look like the bad guy just because you wanna come here and take away my kid . What are you talking about ? Your mom and I had an agreement when you came to live here . It was a year , and then you were supposed to come back to L.A. With me . You 've already ruined your own lives . Just leave mine alone . Were you seeing kim ? More during the months leading up to her ... to the accident . so you never visited her lab ? No . Hey . What 's up ? Noise complaint from the neighbors . What neighbors ? The ones three miles down the road . Exactly what kind of noise are they complaining about three miles down- - Whoa . Never mind . Yeah . Oh . hello ? Ah , excuse me , sir ? Yes ? Hi , I 'm sheriff jack carter , and you are ? Busy . What is it that you need ? Listen , dr . Babajanian , we 've had a noise complaint , and we 're gonna have to ask you to keep it down . But I 'm working on simultaneously configuring the position and momentum of electrons so they 'll no longer be conjugate variables , thereby debunking heisenberg 's uncertainty principal . And as exciting as that may be , we 're still gonna have to ask you to keep it down . Fine . Looks like you have an oil leak . That 's ununseptium , a highly volatile halogen . Whose effects on human skin have yet to be tested . Right . So not an oil leak . Carter ! I told you to watch your head . No , you didn 'T . Okay , you know you need special permission to use transuranic elements outside of global , right ? Of course . Okay , so let me see your permit , doctor . I 'm sure they 're on file , deputy . While we go check that out , we 're going to , uh , have to ask you to still keep it down . Thanks for your time . henry , are you sure about this ? Allison- - I can set you up in a brand-new lab with twice the space . Kim 's lab will do just fine . Then at least let me have someone clear out all the old stuff . No , you said you were gonna leave it the same way it was the day that she ... well , at least until I had time to go through it . I did and I have . It 's just ... this has to be hard for you . I see it as a chance to stay close to her , continue her work . You know , we used to finish each other 's sentences . So ... okay . So abby , you 're heading back to los angeles ? Yep , this is it . I 'm sorry to see you go . Oh , no , you 're not . Sheriff carter and zoe will miss you . No , they won 'T . Perhaps if you weren 't taking zoe away ... S.A.R.A.H. , Forgive me if I don 't feel the need to justify my parental choices to a talking bunker . Fine . Don 't let the door hit you on the way out . You wanna piece of me ? Are you , uh , threatening the house ? She started it . Yeah . Are you okay ? Yeah , I got a headache . Where 's zoe ? She 's in her room . She 's okay . She 's using a virtual therapy device that beverly gave her . It 's called an A.T.S. I 'll tell ya , the things this town comes up with ... oh , yeah , it 's a great place to live . I mean , it 's sort of full of mind-blowing opportunities and brilliant minds at the top of their game . And the schools--amazing . Jack . Yeah ? Are you really okay with this ? We had an agreement . I know . But I just don 't want you to do that thing that you do , you know , when you say you 're okay with something and then six months after that , we 're at my parents ' 50th wedding anniversary and you 've had one beer too many , and you ask my mom if the ball-buster gene comes from her side of the family ? You threw out my baseball cards . We were having a baby . We needed the room . I had a 1989 upper deck ken griffey , jr . Rookie card . Do you have any idea how much that 's worth now ? No , and dear god , before you tell me , let 's just try and swing this right around to my original point . Are you okay with me taking zoe back to L.A. ? Yeah.I 'm okay . Okay . 'Cause the end of the semester 's coming up , and I 'm gonna be coming back to get her . So ... I 'll call ya . Zoe ! How many times have I asked you not to leave your stuff lying around ? Huh ? Zoe . Zoe ? Hey ! I 'm talking to you here . Hey , I 'm getting my head shrunk here . Yeah , well , shrink it after you 're done cleaning up your mess , okay ? Is that the , um ... irs thing from beverly ? A.T.S. She 's out of town and ... she thinks it 'll help me confront my inner fears and resolve my anger issues . How 's it working ? Well , I 'm still pretty pissed , so ... do you wanna talk ? No , actually . I want you to leave me alone . Hmm . Okay , that 'S ... the exact opposite of leaving me alone . I know you 're upset . But your mom really misses you . We agreed to shared custody . And I think that , um , if you don 't give this a shot , you will regret it . Custody . Meaning ownership . Meaning I have no say . Zoe , your mom loves you a lot . Well , you know , I gotta give her credit . At least she 's willing to fight for me . Zoe . Zoe . I 'm gonna go clean up my stuff . Whoa , whoa , whoa whoa ! What are you doing ? Uh , rearranging furniture . What are you doing here ? Well , I said I was taking the afternoon off , not quitting . Okay . Okay , so everything back in its place . Go . Sure , why should I get to be by the window ? Hey , um , did you pull those , uh , permits I asked you to ? What ? The permits for , um , babajanian 's contraption ? What are you talking about ? I swear , sometimes ... I wonder if you even listen to me . I feel like I 'm talking to myself . Jo ? Jo ? hey , sheriff . What can I get for ya ? Uh , nothing right now . Have you seen jo ? W-who ? My deputy . Oh , you got a new deputy ? That 's great . I didn 't get a new deputy . I have a deputy . Deputy jo lupo . Oh . Yeah . Is he cute ? Okay , now you 're just bugging me . I-I really need to talk to her . Uh , listen , maybe I could help . Has anybody here ever heard of a , uh , deputy lupo ? Sorry , sheriff . I don 't think anybody here has ever heard of her . ± ¾ × ÖÄ " ½ ö ¹ © Ñ § Ï ° ½ " Á ÷ £ ¬ ÑÏ ½ ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ ¾ - = ÆÆÀÃÐÜ × ÖÄ " × é = - · ­ Òë : Ð £ ¶ Ô : Ê ± ¼ äÖá : ÊØ " ¤ ÌìÊ ¹ ¾ ÆÄÒ · ¹ ´ ü ÌìÊ ¥ ² Ý Henry ? jack . Oh , there you are . Here I am . I thought you 'd be at global today . No . Huh . Jack , you need something ? Do you know a woman named jo lupo ? No , don 't think so . Okay , this is really gonna sound strange . I have a deputy named jo lupo . Small , but surprisingly strong . Bit of a gun nut ? No . All right , I was having a conversation with her today , I turn my back for two seconds , and she 's gone . Like vanished , and no one in the town even remembers her . Okay ... so , um , I think everyone is playing a trick on me , right ? So I go to her house , and , uh ... you know , the name on the mailbox is changed , and there 's a family with , like , 12 kids living there , and the house is a different color , which is a bit far to go for a prank . A bit , yeah . You think I 'm losing it , don 't ya ? Um ... you think you 're losing it ? I know this woman ! You know this woman ! All right , maybe something 's affected your body chemistry or altered your neural pathway somehow . Were you exposed to anything ? Yeah , I visited a guy , he was , uh , playing with ... a new , uh ... atlantic element . Transuranic ? Yes ! Yeah , that 's it . Would that do it ? No . Okay . What else have we got ? Well , um ... maybe , uh ... all right , maybe you fell into some freezing water , and , uh , you went into hypothermia . No . Or you suffered a trauma , and that sent you into shock . Wha- - Yeah , I hit my head . With what ? A heavy , metal object . How many times ? Repeatedly . Well , see ? That would have some effect . So if that 's our problem , get an mri . Henry , I 've had a concussion before , that 's not it . Do you remember occam 's razor ? Um , yeah . Uh ... simple things , uh , are true . Close enough . So you are either part of some ... theoretical , unknown , scientific discovery where people vanish from our world and memories , or ... you suffered a head trauma . Well , when you say it like that ... get an mri . Yeah . I 'm not saying that you can 't have one . I 'm just asking why do you want one ? It 's not a big deal . It 's just , uh , I bumped my head this morning and henry thought it 'd be a good idea if I had it looked at . You having any dizziness , nausea , headaches ? No , my head was pounding earlier , but it 's , uh , fine now . Actually , it 's totally fine now . Problem solved . What 's he even doing here ? He works here . He was fired weeks ago . Okay , brain scan it is . Run an eeg and draw blood . No , I just need an mri , thanks . Relax , it usually only takes me two or three tries to hit a vein . Oh , you 're pretty talented . Really ? No ! Do you know anyone who 'd be working on A ... really intense , unknown , theoretical scientific discovery ? You mean like a class eight project ? Yes . Let 's talk about those . Sorry , all class eight research is classified . Mm ... oh , you know what else should be classified ? A certain assistant 's american idol audition . What ? No , no ! Zoe promised me she was gonna delete that . What 's it gonna be ? Fine . Gimme an hour . All right , so put the gown on , and all metal objects and jewelry in the tray . All right . Are you okay ? Uh , yeah . Just got a lot on my mind . You know , you can always talk to beverly . First of all , no . And , uh , second of all , she 's out of town . No , she 's not . I just saw her at cafe diem . R--well , then why 's she having zoe do therapy from home today ? I don 't know , but ... is zoe okay ? Uh , actually , not so much . No . Abby 's taking her back to L.A. At the end of the semester as a part of our custody agreement . And are you okay with that ? Um ... yeah . It 's complicated . Well , what do you think you should do about this ? I don 't know . What can I do ? I don 't know , but if someone was gonna take kevin away from me , I would feel like my world was ending . Yeah . Let 's get this over with . Hey , how 's your head ? A waste of time . The mri was clear . Well , I wouldn 't rule out your injury just yet . It might not be me , though . I mean , it might be a , uh , class eight project ? And what do you know about class eight projects ? Mainly that I 'm not supposed to know about them . Yeah , that 's true . And I don 't think that 's your problem , because most of that research is theoretical . I know , I know , and I know what I 'm asking isn 't probable , but is it possible ? Yeah , well ... it might have something to do with meta-material technology or vector decomposition or cellular irradiation . Okay . But none of those things could remove someone from the world 's consciousness . Unless ... it was some kind of transdimensional travel . Okay , let 's go with that . What 's that ? Movement between parallel universes . Right ... so you 're saying that jo got zapped to another universe ? Or maybe you did . Theoretically , every universe is different . But the closer they are , the more alike they are , with maybe just one difference . A green sky instead of blue , cats chase dogs or- - or in a town of 3,000 people , one of them isn 't where they 're supposed to be . Exactly . You know what , we should go talk to nathan about this . He 's really good with this kind of thing . Great ! Thanks . You 're welcome . You know , I was really starting to worry if it was something to do with me . Well , that 's where the smart money still is . Funny . Henry ? Henry ? Henry ! You wanna run that by meone more time ? People are disappearinginto this crazy light , and nobody remembers thembut me . People like ... what difference does it make ? You 're not gonna know whol 'm talking about anyway . Carter--stark ? I 'm gonna double-checkyour mri . There 's nothing wrongwith my head . Well , what you 're describingsimply is impossible . There 's no technology that couldcreate such an anomaly . Not even in eureka . Well , how about , um , many-materials technology or , like , the cell phoneradiation or decomposing vectors ? And now you 're justputting words together . Okay , I don 't knowwhat I 'm talking about , but henry saidthat you would . Henry ... ? Henry deacon.The- - how do you not remember--he was a friend of yours . I have a lot of friends . Actually , not so much . But we 'll table that . Um , I think it has somethingto do with me , okay ? People I interact with , people I know , but whatever it is , we have to figure it outbefore it affects the other 3,000 peoplein this town . You see , now I knowit 's in your head , because eureka 'sonly half that size . That means it 's spreading . Nathan , you gotta help me . Okay . Great . Where do we start ? You start by going homeand getting some rest . And I 'll start bydouble-checking your mri . Come on . Come on . Zoe ? Hey , what 's up ? Hey , um , uh , where are you ? Home . Why ? All right , stay put . Okay ? What 's happening ? I don 't know , but if you see a big flash of light , I need you to run . All right , just get away from it , and you call me , okay ? Seriously ? Yeah . Seriously , um ... I 'll be in touch . Gotta go . Fargo ! Fargo . Did you get it ? Yes . But you can 't tell anyoneI showed this to you . If you don 't show it to me , there might not be anyone leftto tell . I have no ideawhat that means . Ah , you don 't have to . Why do you need it anyway ? You wouldn 't believe meif I told you . Huh , stark 's on this list . Of course he is . He 's done moreclass eight projects than anyone elseat global . And this guy , I know this guy . Saw him this morning.Uh , dr . Babajanian ? Yeah , he 's a quantum physicist . Any chance what he 's doing could punch a holein another dimension ? Not likely , but when you start dealingwith subatomic particles , the typical laws of natureno longer apply . Okay . Thanks . And , um ... you got a great voice . Don 't let anyone tell you different . Hey ! Allison . Hey , carter.What 's going on ? I need you to come with me . There 's this noise complainton the outskirts of town . This guys is using an element hedoesn 't have permission to use . So make himget a permit . Yeah , well , I 'm not supposedto know this , but he 's one of your class eight scientists . Carter , everyone knows whothe class eight scientists are . Well , fargo said he 'sworking with atoms , and I just think this guy babajanian could be a reallyserious threat . Who ? Uh , babajanian . Weird guy , liveson the outskirts of town . Yeah , I know whobabajanian is . Who told youthat he works with atoms ? Fargo . Oh , man . Mm , hey , sheriff . Soup ? Ya hired larry the kiss-ass ? Okay , carter , I have work to do . Allison ... whatever this guy 's doing , it 's making people disappear , and I seem to be the only onewho 's noticing . Please . Please come with me . Okay . Oh , hey , and watch your head . He 's got this bigbooming machine with lots of littlethings spinning ... you 'll see . Dr. Babajanian ? Dr. Babajanian ? This can 't be happening . Can I help you ? Where 'd you put it ? Sorry ? Where 'd you put it ? The machine with the lightsand swirling ? Could you bea little more vague ? The thing you built to find outwhere the electrons are and how fast they 're moving . I was right here this morning.I saw it . What were you doingin my lab ? I know you 're up to something . I 'm gonna figure outwhat it is . Miss blake ... I 'm sorry about the intrusion , dr . Babajanian . Let 's go . Allison . Carter , there 's nothing here.Let 's go . Move ! Not again . I can 't believe it got him too . What are you talking about ? You have no idea what just happened , do you ? I know you dragged me outto an empty lab . And you 're startingto scare me . We gotta get outta here . Where do you thinkyou 're gonna go ? I 'm not sure . Well , I 'm gladyou thought this through . Well , we 'll get kevin , we 'll get zoe , and we 'll get the hell outof dodge while we still can . Avoiding the issue isn 't goingto help resolve it . Well , when the issueis that the people I care aboutkeep disappearing , I 'm willing to dowhatever it takes . Carter , listen to me.I trusted you . I need you to trust me . Let 's just go backto the office , I promise , we will figure this out . You wanna help ? Here . One of the 20 peopleon that list knows exactly what 's going on . Help me figure out which one . Carter , there is nothing writtenon this piece of paper . Please . I know that I can help you . carter , we need to slow down and talk about this . I 'm telling you , we gotta leave.It 's spreading . We can 't stay . Carter , just drink some waterand calm down . You 're dehydrated . I 'm dehydrated ? You gotta be kidding me . Just drink the water , all right ? I 'm fine.Just drink it ! Why the helldo I wanna drink- - so I don 't haveto do this . I 'm sorry.It was for your own good . How are you feeling ? Like somebodystabbed me in the back . And then stabbed mein the neck . I 'm sorry , there 's nothing elseI could do . You were practicallyhysterical . I expect it from stark . Not so much you . Stark ? Ex-husband nathan stark . Egomaniacalbane of my existence . Uh , well , that does sound likesomeone that I would marry- - But , no , I 've neverheard of him . The only wayto fix the problem , is to recognizethat you have one . What is that ? Aa ? Carter- - allison , don 't I--I mean , apart from the ... remembering peoplethat don 't exist thing , don 't I seemrational to you ? The former seemsto negate the latter . Why are you talkinglike beverly ? I 'm just trying to help you . Okay , then think thisthrough with me . How many offices are thereat global ? Over 1,000 . How many people work there ? Maybe 100 . Doesn 't thatseem odd to you ? We 're in a transitionalperiod . Or your mind is reachingto justify what 's happening . I could saythe same for you . Okay . But you gotta let mego get zoe . I can 't deal with losing her . I won 'T . Okay . Thank you . Allison , come here.Don 't let it touch you . Allison , move ! Everything 's gonnabe all right . S.A.R.A.H. , Door . Is everything okay ? Not even close.Zoe ! Zo- - Thank god . Zoe ! What 's going on ? Hey , sweetie . Um , get your shoes on , we gotta go , okay ? What 's happening ? No questions , just go . All right ? Okay.Okay , great . S.A.R.A.H. , Um , how many peoplelive in eureka right now ? My current calculations say two- - you and zoe . Okay , thank you . Um ... back to the beginning . Zoe ! Zoe . I 'm coming . What do you rememberabout this morning ? What do you mean ? Um , okay , your mom was here , and , uh , you and igot in a fight , and you threw the thing at meand you left , right ? Okay , mom has neverbeen to eureka , I don 't remember gettingin a fight with you , and I don 't knowwhat thing you 're talking about . The thing . The therapy thingy--the A.T.S. What ? Oh , for the love of ... I was sitting here . And I had it in my hands . And I stood up . Dad . I never put it down . So ? So ... then I go back downstairs and isee you on the couch , right ? And I say that I 'mgoing off to the office ? Okay , that I remember . But nothing before that ? Well , nothingthat you 've mentioned . So that 's our firstshared memory . Dad , I have no idea- - what I 'm talking about , I know . That 's the problem . And the only wayto solve a problem is to recognizethat you have one . Okay , you soundlike my therapist . Or a therapy device . Right , like the same onethat you had , the one that I haveno recollection of putting down . I mean , I must 'vetried it on , right ? That 's why everybody sounded like beverly . Except you . This is gonna be hardto swallow . Um ... I don 't think any of thisis real . Okay . I think that I 'M ... we are in a program . And , uh ... I don 't know howto find my way out . Dad , you 're freaking me out . Dad . Dad , can you hear me ? Dad , can you hear me ? Please wake up . I 'm so scared . Please . Oh , sweetie.Mom. I drove backas fast as I could . What happened ? I was doing my therapyon the A.T.S. And dad walked inand we got in a fight and I threw it at him , and for some reason , he put it on , and when I walked back in , he was shakingand he wouldn 't wake up . And I shouldn 't havethrown it at him . Honey , it 's nobody 's fault . But can 't you justtake this off ? We 're afraid that simplydisconnecting him could send himinto paralytic shock . So what is happeningto him ? Actually , we 're not sure . The , um , A.T.S. Was developed in collaboration with beverly barlowe . But we 've never had thishappen before . It 's a virtual versionof eureka , down to thevery last detail . The user 's subconscious issuescome to life in the game . Normally , they 're aware of whatthey 're experiencing , and they can leave the programat any time . We think the concussion may have caused a glitchin the mainframe , that carter is unawarethat he 's in an altered reality . Is his life in danger ? Someone answer me . Yes.It is . So let 's get beverly down hereand fix it . Well , we can 't reach her . So we sent henry to her house to find any informationthat can help us . Beverly , this is henry.I 'm in your house now . We really need your help . So when you get this message , call ! dad , where are we going ? If this isn 't real , therehas to be a way out , right ? Like an exit sign ? Yeah , I 'm not that lucky . Um , you said this therapy thingis for confronting your fears , working out anger issues ... okay , I don 't remember that . Yeah , well , you said it . And I 'm not angry . So maybe confronting fearsis the way out . Yours or mine ? Well , I 'm wearing the thing , so I 'm guessing mine . Okay , so whatare you afraid of ? Right now , that . What is that ? ! That 's what 's been takingpeople . Dad , what are you doing ? Confronting my fear . Abby . I am so sorry.Are you okay ? I 'M ... yeah . I 'm just , uh ... looking for a cupof coffee . Allow me . I , uh , cook when I 'm upset . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . What are you all doing here ? We 're herefor carter and zoe . All of you ? Well , yeah , I mean ... he 's our sheriff , and she 's our girl . Henry , did you find anything else ? Just another A.T.S. Device . Now , I can take it apart , and we can see what the mechanics are . - Yeah , well , if he can hold on that long . - Yeah . Hey , honey . There 's a whole lotof people out there who are worried about you . You wanna come say hi ? Not right now . Zoe , you gonna eat ? He wouldn 't leave me . I 'm not gonna leave him . Dad . Zoe , come on . What are you doing ? Come on . Why aren 't we running ? We don 't have to . You 're gonna go.It 's gonna take you . I 'm gonna stay with you . Uhh ! Dad ! W-what 's happening ? We 're losing him . Wait ! He 's fighting . Jack . Dad ! Jack , you 're all right ! I thought I 'd lost you . Oh , no , never.No. No , no , no . I knew you wouldn 't leave . I 'm here . Looks good . Looks very good . Well , great . Hey , uh ... henry said you could have visitors ? Uh , yeah , yeah , that 'd be great . Okay , guys , come on in ! You look great . Zoe , hi . - Hi . - Abby ! Hey , good to see ya . Good to see ya . Ahh ! Hey , chris.Thanks very much . I really appreciate it . Thanks for that . Hey , thank you so much . How many of you are there ? Hi . Hey . Hey , how you feeling ? Um ... a little strange . You know , I have all these , uh , memories and feelings aboutthings that never happened . Well , that 's gotta bepretty surreal . You have no idea . Anyway , I just stopped byto see if you were okay . To see if I 'm okay ? Yeah , this is your first dayback in kim 's lab . I know that 's a big deal . Jack , it 's fine.Really. I mean , you 're the onewe should be worrying about . They told me , uh ... the therapy thingwas forcing me to deal with my feelingsabout losing zoe . Apparently I have , um , abandonment , entitlement , and intimacy issues . - Ha , congratulations . - Thank you . Even though that wasn 'tactually you , you helped me a lotin there . I don 't know what I 'd dowithout you . Me too . I should get going . Abby 's taking off , and I gotta talk to her before she goes , so ... all right , well , good luck and , um , thanks . Yeah . Jack . Abby . You wanted me to stop by . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I think we should talk . Yeah , I know . Um ... I 'm happy here . I know I complain about it , and ... it definitely has its quirks . Yeah , that 's one way of putting it . Yeah . But , uh ... I belong here . And I 'm doing some good . You do.And you are . And I think this placehas been good for zoe . You know , I thinkshe fits in here somehow . Well , maybe that 's ' cause shedoesn 't fit in anywhere else . She has some good friends . Yeah , I 've noticed that . And I would neverask you to , uh , you know , not take her . That wouldn 't be fair to youor zoe . Jack , listen , I- - that being said ... I can 't go months without seeing my kid . Can 't even go days , really . So I 'M ... gonna ask for my job back in L.A. Really ? Yep . It 's funny , you remind me of a man I once married . So what do you think ? I think this place needs you . And it wasn 't until today that I realized just how much zoe needs you . And I can 't take you away from here . I can 't take her away from you . - But- - - this is where she needs to be . Abby . Thank you . I love you , jack carter . S.A.R.A.H. , Door . Zoe ? Good evening , sheriff carter . Will the former mrs . Carter be joining you for dinner ? Oh , relax , S.A.R.A.H. , She 's gone . What a shame . Sarcasm doesn 't become you . Is ... zoe , what are you doing ? Oh , I 'm sorry , I meant to haveall this cleaned up before you got home . Oh , it 's okay . It doesn 't matter.Leave it . Your mom and I had a talk . I told her how much you love it here , and , uh ... that you--you wanna stay . Um ... And I told her that I would respect our agreement . Oh . Um , what did she say ? Oh , she seems to think that , um , I need adult supervision . So ... if you 're up for the task ... um , I think I can handle it . I never wanted you to leave . I never wanted to go . Dad , um ... thank you for fighting for me . Yeah . S.A.R.A.H. , What are you doing ? That was such a beautiful moment , I thought musical accompaniment seemed appropriate . Uh , yeah , on second thought , L.A. ' S not looking so bad . Well , you 're stuckwith us now , so , um , what do you say--burgers , cafe diem ? Sounds good . oh , S.A.R.A.H. , Knock it off .

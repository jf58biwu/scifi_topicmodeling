 You all right , soldier ? You need a doctor ? Easy , soldier . It will be all right . Just ... Just put that gun down . What about Jeremy , the one from the bar ? Married . Not happily ? You 're in a good mood tonight . I 'm always in a good mood . Honey , you have been walking around miserable all week . Seriously , what 's going on with you ? It 's like the weight of the world is on you , lately . That 's what margaritas are for . What about my brother ? No . Why not ? Because , honestly , Robin , he 's gay . He is not ! It 's fine . Just stop trying to set him up with your girlfriends . You guys are so cynical . Besides , I don 't need a man in my life right now . Yes , you do . Honey , it 's almost winter . Every day is precious . Trust me . I don 't need a man to make me happy . That is really sad . Pathetic . Yeah . Ditto . Oh , my God . Guys , look at this . Look at this . Names of the victims will be released after the families have been notified . This is a stunning and tragic event . The soldier was a POW , held captive And feared dead for two months . He was set to ship home later this week . The military is investigating this ... Hello ? We have a situation . What is it ? It 's supposed to be a treatment for depression . I feel better already . It has to be implanted in your brain . But this particular neural implant has some side effects . Okay . Three American soldiers , all POW 's held by an al-Qaida cell , all released . All suddenly make very specific attacks on their own men . They 're like human car bombs . They all had this neural implant ? Yeah . We don 't know what it does , but , we know where it comes from . Professor Howard Samuels . He runs the country 's most cutting edge lab developing these things at Stanwick University . How about we start by arresting Samuels ? We 're not cops . Antonio is going to go after the buyer and you 're going after the implants . So , what ? I break into the lab ? It 's not that simple . What 's this ? Student ID . You 're going to college . You 're transferring in from England . How 's your British accent ? These are the basic classes you would have had to have taken as a transfer student in Neurobiology . Cellular Neuroscience , which is just about how neurons process physiological and electrochemical signals ... Glad that 's all it 's about . Systems Neuroscience , which is just about how neurons , you know , form circuits ... Can you stop saying " which is just about " ? This is an insane amount of information to process this quickly . You just have to pull up that Harvard part of your brain . The part that never went to Harvard is much bigger . Besides , I was going to major in Irish literature . Well , then , you dodged a bullet when you didn 't go , because you 'd have ended up $ 100,000 in debt and still a bartender . Science , Jaime . It 's what pays the bills . I 'm going to look like a total idiot ! You can 't fake math and science ! Okay . Look . Okay . Just calm down . Just take ... Going to college was a fantasy for me . But in my fantasy , I 'm hanging out with intellectual people tossing a Frisbee around , making a nice pot of Earl Gray , and finishing my dissertation on James Joyce . Wow . We have very little in common . And now , I 'm going to look like a total idiot , faking my way through Cellular Neuronscience Physio whatever . Yeah ... Neuroscience . Yeah . Yeah . You could wear glasses . Then , you would look smarter . Thank you , Nathan , for that completely unhelpful suggestion . What ... Just doing my job . " Thank you , Nathan . " You 're welcome . ... somatosensory cortex , we have areas one , two and three defined by the medial longitudinal fissure central , and lateral sulcus . This region receives the majority ... Young lady , you 're new ? Sorry . Sorry . Yes , I just transferred in from Oxford . Clarissa Whyte . I presume English is your first language ? Yes . Then , perhaps you can tell me what that sign says . No cell phones . Come on . A little conviction in your voice . Try again . No cell phones . That is so much better . Now , you 're on a roll . Perhaps you can tell me when my lecture is interrupted by students who can 't remember to turn off their cell phones what area of my brain is firing like crazy ? Well , that would be ... I 'll give you a hint . It 's the region that processes emotions like irritation . And if that doesn 't help , it 's bordered by the inferior and middle temporal area . That would be Brodmann area 38 . Also known as the polar gyrus . Yes . That is correct . Keep your cell phone off in my classroom . How about this ? Faraj Habib . I 'd say if he weren 't in Guantanamo right now he 'd be our guy . Nadeem Samad . I like him for this . Well , he has no known ties to any terrorist organization . He has no criminal record . And graduated college with honors . He started obsessively visiting terrorist websites 14 months ago . I 'm on websites all the time . You 're doing research . Maybe he was , too , doing a paper in college . He took two classes with Professor Samuels , and became a practicing Muslim all in the same time period . Ruth , this is racial profiling . Or brilliant detective work . Check him out . Hey , Aoki ? Oi ! Every time you crumple that paper , it makes me want to kill myself . That 's what my last roommate did . Great . It was great . I got all A 's for the semester . You 're kidding . Yes . What are you working on ? Neuroscience lab work . Really ? I loved that class . Easy A. Of course you did . What are you working on ? I have a paper on James Joyce due . Yeah ? Yeah , The Dead . I don 't even understand what it 's about . It 's all like Irish and stupid ... No . It 's a great book . It 's all from the husband 's point of view the whole time until the end of the book , when his wife tells a story about her first love . And the husband , who has been so loving towards his wife all evening , realizes she wasn 't even thinking about him . She was thinking about her first love , who 's dead . It 's about how you can 't escape . Like , somebody dies , and you think you 're free , but you 're not . The dead are always there . Which is a different ending to Ulysses , which is all about love and life and sex and optimism . Okay . Do you want to ... Do you want to just do it for me ? You want to do my lab work ? Deal . Deal . Give me one of those chocolate bars . There 's a party later , if you want to go with me . So , do you know lots of people here ? A few . There 's food here . Yeah , okay . Hey . The transfer student from Oxford . Merciful TA . Tom Gilchrist . Clarissa . Nice to meet you . Thank you so much for earlier . I totally blanked . Well , Samuels can be intimidating . Yeah , he is a little ... He 's a mean , mean , cranky old man ... Yes . He is . ... is what he is . But you 're very nice to take pity on me . Can I interest you in a tasty beverage ? A tasty beverage ? Step off . Who is this guy ? Can you ... You know what they say about the Brits . We love our drinks . Go away ! He 's trying to get you drunk . Can 't you see that ? Vodka ? Wine ? Wine . So , you must be lonely , being so far away from home . Actually , no . It 's quite exciting , being in America and all . I feel like Felicity . Only she wasn 't from England , and she wasn 't a scientist , and she went to college to look for a guy , which I didn 't . So , I don 't feel like Felicity at all . I don 't know what I 'm saying . Can you talk now ? I kind of like listening to you free associate . I feel a little discombobulated . Jet lag . How about you ? How long have you been Samuels ' TA ? Oh , just this semester . It 's too bad he 's such a bastard , because he really is brilliant . He 's doing work that 's going to make a difference . It 's his work in neural imaging research that made me want to be his TA . My dad died of Parkinson 's last year . I 'm so sorry . Oh , yeah ? Oldest trick in the book , Sommers . Answer the phone . But after he was diagnosed it was a wake-up call . Before that , I was a bit of a screw-up . Almost dropped out of college . I 'd never know it . Well , now I want to be a neurosurgeon . Neurosurgeon ? Oh , what ? Was astronaut taken ? Am I right ? I want to help people . I want to change their lives . You know ? I want to make ... I 'm sorry . This is boring . No ! Isn 't it ? Yes ! Chatty Cathy , cut the cord . God ... What ... Okay . Hate to have to do this to you , Jaime , but you leave me no choice . You all right ? Yeah . Bionic ear is hurting . Yeah . Ear ache . I left my drops at home . Oh . Could you excuse me ? You 're an ass . Tick tock , okay ? The change-over at the lab isn 't until 11 : 00 . Yeah . Which is in five minutes . Yeah . I know what time it is . I was doing ... What do you call it ? Recon . Recon ? You can 't just throw around the word recon . That wasn 't recon . That guy wants to be on top of you . Really ? Do you think so ? Get your head in the game , Sommers . You 've got to get over to the museum . What are you eating ? Chinese food . Kung Pao Cafe ? You get the moo shoo ? Lo mein chicken . Moo shoo 's better . Okay . You should see a ladder to the roof . There 's no ladder . Okay . What 's plan B ? Plan B is you 're bionic . Figure it out . Okay . Hold on . You okay ? Yeah . I was just hanging onto my cell phone and it messed me up . So typical of this place . They spend $ 50 million on you and then won 't spring for a Bluetooth . By the way , I 'll bet my paycheck that the story about his dad dying of Parkinson 's was a load of crap . You are so cynical , Nathan . It 's not attractive . I 'm telling you that as a friend . I 'm just saying that you can 't believe everything everybody says to you . And I 'm just saying you have to assume the best in people . You have to assume that not everyone is trying to screw you over . Even if it 's hard sometimes . Okay . Hang on a sec . Okay . Where was I ? Yeah . Not everyone is going to want to screw with you . Even if it 's hard to believe . Wow . That would be a good attitude to have if you weren 't a spy . Why are you not in the lab already ? I 'm going as fast as I can , bossy . Crap . The glass is wired . Yeah , don 't worry . It 's an analog circuit . We can override that , easy shmeasey . Can you find the contacts ? By the way ... Why are you using the accent with me ? I 'm a method actor . Fine by me . It 's literally the hottest thing ever . Found them . Okay . You 've got to put something metal between the contact points to keep the circuit from breaking , like a paperclip , or a hairpin ... Or a steel bar . Okay . Give me the code . 3QR4651 . I 'm here . I 'm in . What do I do ? Computer . Let 's start scanning . We need to get the dirt on Samuels . So , I 'm a glorified fax machine . Come on . Don 't sell yourself short . You can also open cans . Now , we need to find out who he may have contacted about the neural implants . Okay . Old journal articles . MPTP Neurotoxicity . Apparently , the guy is a pioneer in Parkinson 's Simulation . Some grant applications ... Wait . Synthetic neurotransducers . That 's it . Right , Nathan ? Looks good . It looks ... Let 's get out of there . What are you doing ? Just curious about him . I want to know how old he is . Unbelievable . Professor Samuels . I know who you are . Sean , go back to my office and get started on the research while I talk to Miss Whyte . I 'm well aware of every pharmaceutical company , competing university , and everyone else trying to steal information from us . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I just transferred in from Oxford . I don 't care where you 're from . I just want to know what you 're doing in my lab . Sir , I 've wanted to be part of this program for years . You know , you were a pioneer in Parkinson 's Simulation . That 's why I transferred here . Your work is cutting edge . And I made such an idiot of myself in class and someone said if I wanted to get back in the good books to clean out the monkey cages . And now I realize it was a joke . And I feel so stupid . How did you get past security ? The door was unlocked . Clarissa ? What are ... You didn 't actually clean out the monkey cages , did you ? Yeah . I did . I told her to do that . Sorry . I 'm also the one that left the door unlocked . I forgot some papers to grade . I came back to get them . The only reason I 'm here now is because I remembered I left the door unlocked . Never happen again . So ... You 're dedicated . I 'll give you that . Okay , Tom . How about you escort Miss Whyte out ? I 'm watching you . Thanks . What were you actually doing in there ? The truth ? Yeah . I was trying to get a copy of the lecture . I can 't read my notes , and I 'm in way over my head . Well , I can help you with that . You can ? For a price . Dinner . Tomorrow night . 8 : 00 work for you ? I 'm supposed to buy you dinner ? I 'm buying . I just want you to show up . Sure . You know what ? The next time you have a crappy , lame hunch like this , put Nathan on it , please . What 's the latest ? They 're getting through the appetizers . She had the Caesar , he had the soup du jour . Both were wonderful . But the tortilla soup was a little spicier than he expected . And I swear to God , if I have to sit here while they order dessert , I 'm going to kill you . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Hold on . Hello ? Yes , that 's right . Sunday won 't be acceptable . Friday . We said 5000 . Get back-up . We 're going to need someone on this guy 24 / 7 . There are those who find DNA mapping to be the key to our future . Me ? It 's the map of the brain . The way we think . How , why , who we are is ... It 's in here . Yes ? Check this out . Before the implant , the subject 's tremors were so severe he couldn 't hold a knife , a fork , drive a car . That 's amazing . You think that 's good ? Watch this . He can juggle . Great . No . You 're missing the point . The neural implant not only reroutes the pathways , but it acts as a receiver . He was sent a signal to juggle . Then , he juggles . What you 're seeing there , totally involuntary . It 's sick . Wait . You can make him do that ? Anything . Watch this . When a computer takes over his body , the subject can be more coordinated and capable than he ever was before . Stop it . Stop it . We can modify pain tolerance , too . Brave new world , isn 't it ? What do we got ? Nothing . The guy hasn 't made any modifications to the application . He 's just treating Parkinson 's . There 's no money trail with him , either . Maybe he 's not the guy . Whoa , whoa ! Who 's that ? That 's the TA who 's trying to get into Jaime 's pants . Really ? I know . It 's like keep your grubby hands off our $ 50 million piece of ... Hey . Yeah , right , right , right . So , what do we know about him ? Well , he went to Undergrad at Stanford . Majored in Cognitive and Neurosystems Sciences . Oh , really ? I went to Stanford . I just think that technology has become way too advanced . You know ? Isn 't it creepy ? I mean , it 's mind control . Well , the possibility for abuse exists , but think of all the people who ... You know what , I don 't want to talk about the chip . Let 's talk about you . You 're just here for a semester , right ? Yeah . I guess I have to work fast then . Wow . I know . Bold . Yeah . Just tell me if I have to slow down . You know , this is ... This is cool . I just realized this is my college fantasy . This is just what I thought it would be like . What ? What ? What ? You ... You have something on your nose . God . No , it 's okay . Here it is . I think I got a little bit more on there . Hi . Hi . What ? You 're not going to introduce me , Clarissa ? This is Tony . My ... Uncle . How are you ? I know . I know . It confuses a lot of people . Me being American and all . Sure . Hi , Tony . I 'm Tom . Shouldn 't you be at work ? Oh , actually , I needed a word . It 's really important . Oh . Oh , well , I 've got to get going , anyway . But , it was great meeting you . Absolutely . We 're still on for 8 : 00 , right ? Dinner ? Yeah . Okay . You and me ? What the hell was that about ? We think Samuels is clean . But that guy , Tom , is under some scrutiny . He only has a paper trail for the last six years . Before that , nothing . That doesn 't mean he was involved . He says he majored in Cognitive and Neurosystems Sciences at Stanford . There is no degree of that name at Stanford . So , he lied on his application . A lot of people do . He 's had a hard time . His dad died of Parkinson 's , you know ? We have to assume that he 's the enemy , Jaime . I don 't believe it . My gut tells me he has nothing to do with this . The last time you listened to your gut about a guy , he had your limbs replaced . Your paper 's done . I e-mailed it to you . These are delicious . I know , huh ? I have some Butterfingers hidden in the bathroom . But , they 're better dipped in butterscotch pudding . What 's with all the hiding food ? I just like secret food , okay ? Why is that such a big deal ? It 's time to take my meds . Hello ? I thought we should have a little post first-kiss caucus . I 'm good with the kiss . It was great . Let 's do it again sometime . Well , what are you doing right now ? Oh , not now . I 'm cramming . I have to go to the bookstore to get this book on Neuroscience , Microchips for Dummies , I think it 's called . It 's supposed to be brilliant . All right . We still on for 8 : 00 ? Absolutely . Great . Bye . Bye . Oh , my God . You totally like him . Stop ! You have no idea what I can do to you ! I can 't stop myself . Help me . Matches the one they pulled out of the soldier in Iraq . My God . Is he going to be okay ? They think so . Who knew where you were going ? Tom . What did I tell you ? It wasn 't him . Can I just ... What does a guy have to do to get you to break up with him ? He had you Manchurian Candidated . The drop is now up to 5000 chips . That 's it . I 'm pulling you off this . No , you 're not . Yes , he is . It 's too dangerous . I can help ! If he 's the bad guy , I want to know just as much as you do . Come on . You 're not going to get anybody closer to him than me . How is your sushi ? Good . How 's yours ? Yeah , it 's great . I love sushi . I don 't really like sushi . Sorry . It 's okay . I don 't really like sushi , either . Well , why did we come here ? I 'm sorry . This is a little weird . You feel weird ? You seem kind of stressed . Do I ? Just a little bit . I mean , it feels like something 's on your mind . You look a little preoccupied . I 'm sorry . I just insulted you , didn 't I ? That was terrible . This is not going the way I wanted it to go . No . I didn 't mean that . You look beautiful . You really do . And I don 't know why I 'm still talking . This is going kind of awfully . You look amazing , and I 'm ... All I 'm doing is insulting you . It 's really terrible . Do you want to ... Do you want to get out of here ? I would love that . Shall we ? I think that 's a great idea . Yeah . Best idea you 've had all night . You know what would be good ? Yeah . I 'm one step ahead of you . Do you , I know this may sound silly . Do you have any champagne ? You want champagne ? Yeah . All right . I 'll get us some champagne . What kind do you like ? The pink kind . Of course you do . Be right back . This guy 's too good to be true . Tarragon ? He is the perfect guy . Tarragon ? He 's too perfect . He lied . I 'm an idiot . We 'll know if it 's the same chip by morning . Nathan needs to run a few tests . So , we 'll just keep him under observation . He 's going to want to know what happened to me . And he 's going to want to know what happened to his microchip . Now , just sit tight . We 've got your dorm room wired . Subject spotted with a blue sweater . Subject at the door . Five , four , three , two , one . Let 's do this . Show me your hands ! Don 't shoot ! Clear ! What are you doing here ? My brother lives here , man . I was just dropping off his iPod . I swear to you . This is for transporting the chips . Who supplies to you ? I don 't know what you 're ... What I am talking about is the Everest Project ! What I am talking about is American soldiers that you are participating in murdering . Tell me who is supplying to you . Now . Was that your family ? This is why you did what you did ? Nadeem , you are killing innocent men . That 's all you 're accomplishing . Tell me where the drop is and when the drop is . And no one else needs to get hurt by this . This is what I think . Too many people have died already . Your people , our people . So , let 's just end this . Here . Hello ? Jaime , the chip 's a match . Antonio just found out the drop is now . Right now . We 're on our way . So , you follow him . Do not let him make the drop . Kill him if you have to . Okay . Malik . Answers to the final . You 're a frigging angel , man . There you go . Thank you . Excuse me ? Could I have that ? What ? Can you give me your paper ? No , it 's mine . Just give it to me . No , it 's mine ! I need to ... Give it to me . I need this . No , you don 't understand . Back away . Crazy bitch . Let me guess . Did you stand him up , too ? Obviously , you thought I was handing him something covert ? No . I ... Who are you ? Who are you ? I asked you first . Why were you following me ? I wasn 't following you . You FBI ? No . You 're freaking FBI , aren 't you ? You were supposed to leave this to us . Who is us ? Come on . Oh , my God . What are you like a CIA agent ? Well , what the hell are you ? I 'm with the Berkut Group . The Berkut Group . Yeah . The insidious , arrogant , always getting in our way , oh , did I mention arrogant , Berkut Group ? Look , it 's really just a temporary gig for me , okay ? Yeah . I thought it was you . It 's not . I thought , maybe , it was you . You 're the good guy . Well , CIA . I mean ... It 's open to interpretation . The Berkut Group had you investigating me ? First Samuels , then you . Sorry . That 's why you went out with me . Isn 't it ? Yeah . I mean , not at first . But then , yeah . Well , that really sucks . Well , why did you want to go out with me ? Because I thought you might be the buyer . Yeah , well . Same thing . No , no , no . It 's completely different . I marked you off my list before ... What happened to your accent ? I 'm not really from England . That 's disappointing . I loved the way you said " brilliant . " It was really a selling point . Turned me on . Yeah , well , your wanting to be a neurosurgeon was a big turn-on and selling point for me , and that was crap , right ? Yeah . Your name 's not Clarissa , is it ? You 're not Tom . Sean ? You got it ? Stay right here . We 'll come to you . Wait . Isn 't that ? Yeah , it is . They 're making the drop . All right . I 'll go down . You stay up here and cover me . Don 't underestimate me . Relax . I 'm trying to be chivalrous . Drop the bag , Sean . That wasn 't a request . Don 't do it . Oh , I think you should do what I say . I 'm not afraid to die . I can arrange that . You all right ? Yeah . Look out ! Hey . Get up . Or die . Get up . Get up , get up , get up . Don 't move , man . I swear to you . Don 't move . Where 's Sean ? Got some cuffs on you ? Yeah . Want to cuff him ? How did you do that ? Top secret . You all right ? I 'm good . Okay . Had a nice chat with your boy , Sean . Why did he do it ? Some deeply distorted political reason ? Money . So , why does the CIA hate Berkut so much ? Well , ask me , they 're jealous . We do what the military , the CIA , and the FBI can 't . We don 't have any red tape or bureaucracy . We get things done , Jaime . Not a good idea . I can 't believe you 're leaving . Yeah . I have to go back to England . Family emergency . That 's too bad . You were my favorite roommate . Oh , check it out . You got an A on your James Joyce paper . Now , the prof wants me to apply to her graduate program . So , I don 't know how I 'm going to get out of that . Oh . Keep it . I 'm late for class . See you around . See you . Where are you going ? I was just ... Yeah ? Casing the joint , you know . Going to rob you later . You were coming to see me , weren 't you ? Yeah , I was just , you know , I wanted to see how you were . Come on . Help me pack . So I joined the Army right after high school . They gave me some tests . Sent me to college , trained me and put me right in the field . I 've got a nice face . People trust me . That 's true . So what about you ? I mean , what 's your story ? I mean , you 've got quite an arm . Were you a quarterback in high school or something ? I don 't want to talk about that . It 's my last night at college . Can we just , hang out ? Pretend we 're normal ? Can we just have a night ? Yeah . Wait . Wait . I don 't even know your name . Jaime . Jaime Sommers . Hi , Jaime .

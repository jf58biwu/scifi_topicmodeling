 Donner ? Sharon , do you copy ? Donner ? Launch now , Donner . Oh , forgive me . I know Donner and I coming onboard last minute is a little awkward . Not for me . Just remember how much I love you . I think the obvious question is simply what the hell happened ? One minute we 're on the mission , the next we 're off . Something 's happening , and I need to know why . RETCHING AND VOMITING Paula Puke ! Queen of the Upchuck , Mistress of Heave . It 's talking to her again . My withdrawal symptoms are under control , doctor . So what you doing there ? You working on the rabbit embryos ? You 're changing the subject . And Ajay - will he be coming back on the floor ? Goss wants to do a thorough psych eval . And if he passes ? He won 't pass , Rollie . 'Ajay once told me that 'the idea of a man knowing everything about something 'is folly . 'His word , not mine . 'He said that man , by his very nature , 'is dependent on other men . 'We need each other to survive . I 'll get that . No . I got it . I can get it . I can get it , too . 'The problem is getting anybody to admit that . ' You must be feeling better . Starving . And I 've got lots of catching up to do . My space classroom , the lander GNC ... You know , if you need some help , I ... Steven , I can count on this spork more than you . 'As a species , we pride ourselves on being self-sufficient . ' No form 24 today . You guys know what to do . 'Why ask a stranger for directions ? 'We 'd rather stay stubborn and lost . ' How many times have you been back ? Three . And all I see is the storm . So how does it make you feel ? What do you mean ? I mean , how does it make you feel ? Afraid ? Alone ? What 's your response to it ? I 'm just trying to help you through this . Eve , all I see is a storm . I 'm in a Martian storm . Good morning , Frenchie . You look way too good to be in withdrawal . I am switching med patches as we speak . I think I 'm through the worst of it . You look awful . Not getting a whole lot of sleep . Wanna talk about it ? I know a good shrink . As long as his office isn 't 6 million kilometres away . Well , then you 're piss out of luck . How 's Ted ? Uh , he 's distant , but he 's doing his job . Whatever Rollie said to him did the trick . Maybe you should talk to Rollie . Ajay 's still on med watch , Donner . Can 't come on floor till he 's cleared . Well , you 're on the floor , Rollie . I didn 't need a psych eval . He did . That simple . It strikes me as damn stupid to have me up here running systems checks without the engineer who helped design it . Point taken . This better not be one of Goss 's games . No , it 's not , Donner . Smells like it . It 's not . So how come I haven 't heard from Ajay ? He has restricted access until he 's cleared . Roger that . I 'll run the check alone . THUNDER RUMBLES Didn 't expect to see you so soon . Didn 't expect to be back so soon . I 'll have the chicken curry . All right . Soda water with lime ? No , I think I 'll have a beer . OK . The nuclear reactor on Antares will power four redundant electrical subsystems . Now on the Mars missions , we were primarily solar . So this is a big improvement . For safety reasons , each of the subsystems is discreetly located on the ship . Sharma , you have your hand in the air . Yes . You have a question ? Your information 's actually out-of-date . There 's three subsystems now . Budget cuts . I 'm sorry ? The change is very recent . Uh , my sponsoring company designed it . I was on the team . Oh , well , then we 're very fortunate to have you here . Aren 't we ? I don 't know what the hell i 'm doing up here . Flapping my gums when we have the designer in the house . Donner . Come on , Sharma . You know everything . Why don 't you get your ass up here and share it with us ? Dude , those are some large , hefty man balls you got swinging down there . Dude , no , man . Donner . In class , making him look like a chump . It takes a pair to do that , especially when he 's on the rag . The rag ? What do you mean ? What , you don 't know what today is ? What ? It 's the fifth anniversary of the Mars disaster today , man . Look at him ! Donner 's ready to take that bag out . Good on you , man . Grinding his face in his shortcomings . He needed it . I 'm cramping . I gotta go take a steam . Life on the ship is an adjustment for everyone . The close quarters , the distance from Earth , the responsibility we have to help our fellow crew members . One of the biggest adjustments we make is to the lack of gravity . Just ask your host , Paula Puke . Stop . Here in our quarters , we have natural gravity caused by the centrifugal force of our spinning rotors . But in the rest of the ship , we create artificial gravity with magnetism and our grav suits . Jorge from La Escuela Gueverra in Santiago , Chile , asked why our hair doesn 't fly . Un excelente pregunta , Jorge . Let 's find out . What do you have in your hands , Zoe ? This is nano spray . We use it on our hair and non-standard clothing to make it slightly magnetic . Can you show us how it works ? Sure . You just , uh , give your hair a couple of good shots ... . .and...Voila ! Porcupine head . Que linda ! You 're so funny ! OK , who just turned out the lights ? Was that the ship or the camera ? The ship . Flight , we have a primary subsystem electrical failure . Donner , tell me that 's you running a systems check . Uh , negative , Mike . I 'm trying to get it back up now . It 's looks like some kind of short or a buss failure . Can you bypass it ? Uh , no . That 's not working . I 'm gonna have to go back and take a look . In the meantime , you guys better start looking for Ajay . We 're not wasting time looking for Ajay , people . Start looking for solutions . I hear they put it on the menu just for you . It 's an astronaut bar . They like to keep us happy . I 've had that curry . You can 't be that happy . It 's not exactly like home , is it ? Right . Yes . And now that you have so subtly reminded me we used to be subjects of the same crown , you should sit , and we should talk , because , well , we share the bond of flag and curry . Exactly . That was not a sincere offer . No , I 'm aware of that . Can I have a ... What he 's having . Thanks a lot . So , um ... Do you know what I did before I was assigned here ? I watched you every night on the evening news . Mm . Yeah , a heady time ruined by a single act of hubris . Guess the lesson is that journalists should not make up their stories , hmm ? And , of course , astronauts shouldn 't really go on unauthorised space walks . I was fixing the shield . I exposed a crooked politician , Ajay . It doesn 't matter , Mr Williams . That 's my point exactly , though , isn 't it ? Here we are , you and I , both exiled from what we should be doing , seeking some kind of redemption . And maybe we should be helping each other . Oh , thanks . Lovely . Looks just how I remember . Well , I understand they 're having a bit of a power problem on the Antares this morning . It 's a shame they 're not consulting you , really . You know , with your , uh ... Excuse me . Yeah , of course . I have to go to the men 's room . Right . Oh , God . It 's just how I remember it . Say , have you got , um , any mango chutney or anything ? Just to , you know ... SLUMP ... THUD. Ajay ? Is anyone left in their bay ? No . What are you doing ? Well , I 'm trying to figure out why anyone would think that Scott Summers is a better leader than Jean Grey . I mean , the sentinels alone ... I like your hair . You remind me of my Mom . What ? There 's something wrong . Yeah , I know . Look at her . Yeah , we were using a magnet . Looks good . We 're going to the flight deck now . Come on . Let 's go . Vamanos . What 's the point ? It 's just a buss failure . Donner 's probably got it under control . Flight , it 's not a buss failure . And all the brayton circuits check out nominal . I 'm gonna have a look up in the node . It 's the only place in the circ where the electrical subsystems meet . What are you doing ? You try to find the problem , and I 'll try to find your sex drive . It 's been missing since you got here . Seriously , Nads . Mm . Don 't you want to try it weightless ? Hmm ? Ow . Damn it . Do you have to leave a mark always ? Just laying claim to my territory . Your territory 's got some work to do . All right , flight , we 're going off grav in aft sector four . ELECTRIC HUM See ? You worry too much . So ? H-2-i-k . And h-2-i-k is bad ? H-2-i-k could be as bad as it gets . Sector four going back on grav . POWER HUMS DOWN I think I worry just enough . Too much , and that 's why nobody likes you . You swim in a sea of self-delusion , Wass . OK , if I 'm swimming in it , you 're drowning in ... THUD AND RUMBLE What was that ? I think it 's the rotor arm . This rotor arm ? Yep , this rotor arm . All right , what we know is that the failure is inconsistent , bridges all over the subsystems , and is somehow related to the mag grav in aft sector four . The mag grav checks out nominal . So it 's related , but not connected . I need to look at code as well as schematics and run a full systems check . OK . Go to work , people . They got it covered , and you got to get to the hospital . We should have operated the day Ajay and Rollie came home . Did we really think it was gonna get rid of their plaque ? It 's changing the crew 's genes . Anything is possible . It doesn 't give us permission to be negligent . Hi . Thanks for calling . Most guys would have called their producers first . How do you know I didn 't ? And I expect a little quid-pro-quo here , of course . Oh , of course you did . Hey , Ajay . How are you ? I 'm fine . I 'll be fine . Tell me about the electrical problem on the Antares . After you come out of surgery , Ajay . It 's just a glitch . How bad is he ? He 's in surgery . But the good news is they don 't have to replace the valve . But what about Rollie ? He 'll have the same plaque procedure this afternoon . No one 's taking any chances . Look , this is emotional for all of us , OK ? But let 's not lose focus on the ship . Worst case ? You mean , besides no Ajay to get us out of this ? Progressive overloads leading to a systemic shutdown , Like the New England blackouts last year . The systems are redundant . Can 't we switch from one subsystem to another ? Yeah , the ship 's programmed to do that automatically , And it 's been trying . This is somehow bridging systems . I 'm gonna check the exterior maintenance panels for damage . An EVA ? I 'm in . No , Donner only . You and Zoe can prep him and help with the egress and the ingress . I 'll be on the flight deck monitoring . Well , if this shutdown is systemic , we could lose power in the labs . I have embryos that could freeze . Then all of you should secure what you can and work in teams . Wass and Paula coming down ? He didn 't want to leave . She stayed with him . It 's getting really cold in here , Wass . This is stupid . It 's gonna be fine . Any minute , the rotor arm ... Oh ! Just twist and grab on ... Yeah , I know how to do it ! There 's gravity on the flight deck . And heat . Well , then go ahead and leave . I 'm really going . So really go then . Fine . I 'm leaving . Good . Do you have a rash , Donner ? I don 't think so . It is really red behind your ... Are those teeth marks ? I think Ted sent you down here to keep an eye on us . Um , what 's the word for the person ... Chaperone . The word is chaperone . And it 's not necessary . Then Zoe can go . No , Zoe will stay . Only because Ted assigned me , not because I want to . This has gotta be hell on him . You know , on both of ' em . I can 't imagine flipping that switch . Leaving two people behind . Donner was sleeping with her . What ? Who ? Sharon Lewis . Big romance . That 's why he won 't touch any of the ASCANS . Too much potential drama . Donner ? I , uh , I didn 't mean anything in the classroom today . I mean , I wasn 't trying to show you up or anything . I just thought it 's the most recent information probably . You know , when I worked for the company , There was always this pressure . Whenever the supervisor came around . Having to know absolutely everything about absolutely everything , which is obviously impossible . My team , we came up with a code . If one person got stuck , somebody else could come and relieve them . We called it an h-2-i-k sequence . What 's an h-2-i-k sequence ? It means ' Hell if I know . ' It 's h-2-i-k . It 's " Hell if I...know. " Hey , Sharma ? Yeah ? Know when to shut up . Conventional wisdom says it 's forbidden to ask , but I am a shrink , so ... Want to talk about it ? You want to talk about those beauty marks ? It 's a simple cardio cath . They break up the plaque sonically , then suck it out . Now he 'll be able to walk off the table . Huh . Ev ? You all right ? Yeah . I just , uh , hate that . Well , it 's probably just the boys down at mission control playing with the mag grav . I bet they 're laughing at us right now . Are you gonna be all right if we ... I can manage if you can . OK . I 'll see you in a bit . All right . 'Flight deck , I 'm ready to egress . ' Uh ... Copy that , Donner . You 're go for a walk . This is one hell of a backyard we got , Ted . ' Roger that . ' We know it 's connected to the mag grav switches . We knew that 3 hours ago . And everything we do to pinpoint it seems to be making it worse . Look , I just told the President of the United States we 'd have this cleared up by tomorrow morning . Don 't make a liar out of me . 'All right , I 'm proceeding to the exterior maintenance panels . ' You know the three of us are gonna be up here together for over six years , right ? And I know that you and Donner are going to screw , knock boots , whatever . He 's a red-blooded guy , and you 're throwing yourself at him . I don 't have to throw myself at him . We 've been sleeping together for years . Fine . You have , yes , and with a little room , I can handle it . But up here ... Up here , down there . We are going to do it whether you like it or not . Of course . Just don 't flaunt it at me . OK ? Don 't scar his body with little intimacies for me to see . Can you do that for me , Nadia ? Because he is all yours . We are not competing . We 've never been competing . I 'm a friend with benefits to Donner . Nothing more . The person you 've been competing with is Sharon Lewis . Ted , I 'm looking at pristine panels . Roger that . They look as good as the day they were installed . No damage to the ship at all . She 's beautiful . You should come in . Roger that . Heading back to the airlock now . Sharon ? Exactly how long are we supposed to overlook the obvious possibility ? Do you honestly think after all these years and the direction it so clearly pushed us in , Beta simply wants to strand your spacecraft ? Nothing else makes sense . Something will . Your guys just have to find it . And what is Williams doing down here ? Quid pro quo for sitting on Ajay and Rollie . The press is all over this electrical glitch anyway . He 's just getting a better view . Donner , are you coming in ? Donner , do you copy ? What is he doing ? Donner , do you have a problem ? Come back to me . INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS Would you people mind if I join you ? Trevor Williams , British Television News . We know who you are . Oh , OK . Good . ( MAN ) Oh . Oh , sorry . Yeah , sure . Cop a squat . Thanks very much . No problem . So I assume you 're all here for the , uh , for the show , eh ? Actually , we 're a little unsure what we 're doing here . I mean , aside from the fact that it 's the anniversary of the Mars mission ... Well , that 's exactly the point , isn 't it ? Tonight we get to be witnesses to prolonged torture disguised as tradition . # MELLOW COUNTRY Three single malts , Tom . Your finest Islay . Can you kill the music ? MUSIC STOPS Why aren 't they saying anything ? They will . Someone will . There is no greater calling than to be an explorer . No greater ambition than to stretch the knowledge and reach of mankind . And there is glory in success . But it rides on the back of personal sacrifice . And it is that sacrifice that we salute here tonight . We raise our glasses to two explorers ... who gave their lives . Who reached as far as man has ever reached ... and paid the ultimate price . They were friends ... they were colleagues ... and they were true heroes . Sharon Lewis and Jeff Walker ... you inspire us , you humble us ... and you will never be forgotten . ( TED SETS GLASS DOWN ) OK ... What just happened there ? Am I clueless ? Well , that goes without saying . ( WASS ) Clever . I don 't think anyone could have said anything that could have made Donner feel better . That 's not the point , Ajay . Goss just made Donner and Ted toast their own failure , toast killing the woman he loved . So then why do it ? Why--why show up at all ? ( TREVOR ) Well , that 's the question , isn 't it ? Why allow Goss to torture you year after year ? Easy . Goss picks the crews . You do it to fly . Donner , my man , this had better be a joke . Talk to me . ( MOUTHS WORDS ) Do you copy ? I can go out , help him back in . No-one else leaves this ship . Talk to me , Donner . Donner , what the hell are you doing ? Donner , you are outside of your flight plan . Get back to the ship now . Flight , we just lost Donner . ( sighs ) Where does he think he 's going ? I have no idea . Donner . INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ( GOSS ) Antares , this is Flight . Get him back on the ship . ( ZOE ) Maddux , you need to talk to me . Whatever you think you 're doing , stop it . We need you back on the ship . Donner , this is Zoe . Do you read ? Damn it , Donner . ( MOUTHS WORDS ) I need you , Donner . Stop . ( ZOE ) Donner . ( MOUTHS WORDS ) ( ZOE ) I need you to come back to me . Zoe ? Donner , do you copy ? Yeah , I hear you , Z. ( TED ) You took off on us there , madman . Roger that . I thought I saw something come off the ship . Uh ... I 'm headed back to the airlock now . We copy . Men only listen when they want to . Yeah . ( SIGHS ) ( WHISPERS ) Damn . You saw something come off the ship ? Yeah . What something would came off the ship ? I--w--like a panel or something . I don 't know . So you chased after it ? Yeah , I chased after it . Why ? ! Would you two stop , please ? Donner 's in . That 's what matters . POWER SHUTS DOWN Ah , terrific . Mission Control ? You guys playing with me down there ? Guys ? Mission Control , are you on comm ? Ted ? JET ENGINES ROAR , MISSILE WHISTLING MISSILE EXPLODES GUNFIRE , PEOPLE SCREAMING , MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY OK , that 's a third stage failure . Half the comm is down . We can start thinking about a progressive blackout . OK , we 're gonna need to call in some outside help from the contractors . Uh , how about some inside help ? I mean , Ajay Sharma should be sufficiently recovered by now . I think your quid pro quo just expired , Trevor . I 'll have a guard escort you back to the press floor . Over half the ship is out . They 're not telling me squat . They 're telling you anything ? Not enough . We need Ajay . Yes , we need Ajay . He should be conscious now . You know how Goss feels . Screw Goss . It 's our ship . It 's his command . It 's our ship , Ted . Hi . Hey . You enjoy the show ? Uh ... It takes a particular kind of jackass . That he is . Hey , you know , I ... understand the whole ... isolated , I-can-do-anything , stud astronaut part of you . I ... I really do , but it doesn 't unman you to need someone else at certain times . I just really don 't think you should be alone tonight . You 're right . Good night . THUNDER RUMBLES We 're showing that the dust is breaching your thruster controls . The storm 's on the rise . We 're losing our launch window . Copy that , Zeus . Yeah , it 's looking bad down here . How far out are they ? 100 metres . We 're holding . STATIC HISSES KNOCK ON DOOR Hey . Hey , brother . Man , three things- - burn that damn recording , we 're never gonna toast again , and from now on , we never spend this anniversary alone . Ajay . Yeah , it 's your command , but it 's our ship . We want Ajay . ( GOSS ) Negative . He 's not healthy . Yeah , neither is the ship . If he 's conscious , he 'll want to help save it . What do you have to lose ? Mike . Get the schematics , the test data and an uplink to the hospital . Right away , sir . Look--look who came back . I never left . I was in my quarters . Oh . Do you have any sweaters ? Yeah , lower left bin . You don 't have to do this , you know . Yeah , Wass , I really do . Why ? I mean , why help me after the whole Paula Puke business ? Is it the whole " Jesus said turneth thou cheeketh " thing ? ( SCOFFS ) No . It 's not because of the whole Jesus thing . Then why ? It 's because you 'll freeze to death if I don 't . Yeah , that 's a good point . Evram ? Evram ? Are you in here ? Evram . ( PANTS ) ( SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( CONTINUES SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) SCREAMING IN DISTANCE , MISSILES FIRE EXPLOSIONS No ! Oh ! ( HYPERVENTILATING ) Hey . Evram , Evram , Evram . You 're OK . You 're OK . I got you . I got you . You 're OK . You 're OK . I got- - You 're right here . You 're right here with me . It 's OK . Hey , buddy . Gave us a little bit of a scare there . Yes , well , luckily , Surgical is more astute than Diagnostic . 'Listen , we 're in a spot up here . 'Kinda hoping you had a can of monkey grease laying around 'for our squeaky door . ' I 've seen the 1,500 briefs . Is there anything you can add to them ? No , that 's about it . You get a chance to take a look ? Yeah . And ? From what I have here , it looks to me like an H2IK sequence . H2IK , huh ? You sure ? I 'm positive . Start at the beginning , Work your way through it . It 's the only way to complete the sequence . OK ? OK . Roger that . That 's what we 'll do . We 'll start and , uh , work that sequence from the beginning . All right , you get better , Ajay . Demand sponge baths from the nurses . You deserve it . OK . Fix it , Donner . So H2IK ? Yeah , stands for Hell If I Know . He didn 't know what it is . It 's time , Wass . We have to get out of here . Come on . What are you so afraid of ? I 'm not af- - People are just wired differently , OK ? And maybe we don 't necessarily like the way we 're wired , but ... But that 's the way it is , and wanting to be different is just a waste of time , so why bother ? Well , that 's all you 're getting . What happened , Evram ? Where were you ? The war . The lights triggered it . Post-traumatic stress syndrome ? This never happened during training ? I 've been ... medicating for alcohol withdrawal . I think these patches are bad . Does Claire know ? Of course she knows . Well , we 'll just keep it between you and me then . So he had no idea ? None . I didn 't want to burn him with Goss anymore . We could always turn around . Not an option . Why ? Why continue on a dead ship ? We could direct abort and be home in a month . I 'm just saying . There 's a solution , all right ? To every problem , there 's a solution . We just have to go back and work it from the beginning . It 's not software . Ted went through everything in the mainframe . It has to be hardware . It has to be a short . It can 't be a simple short . This entire ship is polymer-coated to avoid that exact thing . They wrench in these circuits , and that 's it . What is it ? The Mag Grav . We already looked here . What is it ? The short seems to go on and off with the Mag Grav . And it 's jumping subsystems like it 's moving , right ? So ? So you ever hear one of those stories about a doctor who sews up a patient , but he accidentally leaves a clamp in somebody 's chest ? Back in the dark ages . Well , if the circuit housing in the insulation 's too thin , and for some reason , there 's a large enough piece of stray ... . .conductive metal ... . .you wind up with all kinds of problems . How much do you weigh ? You 're a moron . Uh ... yes. A wrench ? Just a wrench ? Ferrous assembly wrench about yea big straddling all three buss lines . Mag Grav kept shifting around , and that 's what kept me from seeing it in the first place . Well , good thinking , Donner . That didn 't come from me . OK ? If Ajay hadn 't had me run that H2IK sequence , I 'd have never found it . We need Ajay on the floor , Mike . Listen , I 'm not prepared to- - ( ZOE ) We need Ajay . Ajay . Ajay . Put him back on the floor as soon as he 's healthy , Mike . Don 't test us . In the hall thruster , Xenon gas is injected into the chamber , where it 's passed through a hall current and stripped of electrons . Yes ? What 's a hall current ? That 's a good question . Uh ... That 's the hall current right there , OK ? It 's a current ... . .and it was first discovered by a guy named Hall , uh , back in the , uh , I believe it was the 1800s . Uh , and Hall ... who was also an early pioneer of the H2IK sequence ... Uh , yes ? Sorry . Is that Edwin Hall ? Was it his sequence that showed that when electric and magnetic fields are set perpendicular to each other inside a conductor that an electric field flows in a direction perpendicular to both fields ? Yep . Exactly right . That 's the hall current . Answer your question ? Yeah . OK , moving on . Like it or not , man , by his very nature , is dependent on other men . We call ourselves explorers , independent , courageous ... Ajay , we 're reinstating you . Welcome back to the floor . But what are we without the support of our brothers ? I mean , how far do we really get if we try to do everything alone ? When the simplest , smallest thing can bring the whole world around you grinding to a halt . I want peace of mind . Donner ? The guys whipped up some dinner in quarters . I want to rely on my brother . I 'll be right down . . .and know that he 'll find the wrench ... if I don 't .

 Previously on Heroes ... To stop Nathan from telling the world about us . No ! Is there anybody here ? What have you done with Peter ? Put him someplace safe . I 'm Peter Petrelli ! Linderman . You 're the one who healed me . ... for political redemption . I think we found our guy ! What 's his name ? Nathan Petrelli . This single syringe could give powers to anyone . It 's evil , and you should destroy it . Well , you stole something from me . Gotta go ! You 're special . And I couldn 't kill you even if I wanted to . Claire , when you are ready to talk about it , you know I 'm here , right ? Yeah . I 'm so angry . To think that that monster was in this house . Maybe we should go to a motel . He 's not coming back . How do you know that ? Because he got what he came for . You don 't have to give me any details , Claire , but I need to know . Did he ... No . No , it wasn 't that . Claire . I 'll get you a towel . Oh , gosh . I don 't feel anything . It didn 't hurt . There 's no pain . But that 's your power , isn 't it ? No , I heal , but I always feel everything . It hurts the same as it would for anyone else , but not this time . That pain I 'm always so grateful for , 'cause it 's the only time I know I 'm still human . I had another dream . One I 'd rather not repeat . And all because you 're not where you 're supposed to be . So go back where you came from , Peter . I 'm sorry , I 'm a little too busy saving the world right now . You never were as smart as you thought you were . I see a few more years on this planet hasn 't changed that . There are things that I know . Things that you can 't see , Mother . Even in your dreams . I 've seen what you become . I 've seen what you do , so don 't think that I came back here for my health . You have no idea of the fire that you 're playing with . You don 't screw with time . It 's called the butterfly effect . You step on a butterfly today , three years from now , a million people are wiped out . Let 's just hope it 's nobody that I know . Oh , well , what if it is ? What if it turns out to be someone you do know ? Someone you care about ? Claire . You talked to her today , didn 't you ? What did you tell her ? Told her not to go to Odessa . Told her to stay home . Why ? She listened to you . Ended up being where she wasn 't supposed to be , and had a pretty bad day because of it . Don 't believe me ? Go see for yourself . Dr. Suresh ? Hello ? Dr. Suresh ? - Up here . How did you ... Hi . I came to apologize about last night . I 'm sorry I was so ... How did you just do that ? That serum I made . You know how I said it would give abilities to anyone instantaneously ? You didn 't . I sure did . But you said it still needed to be perfected . I was wrong . And the results have been beyond my wildest dreams . I woke up this morning and I have never felt anything like it . I 've been cataloging the whole experience , monitoring my vitals . So it didn 't give you my abilities ? Far from it . My senses are heightened . I 'm stronger , faster , more agile , have boundless energy . I 'm a new man . Watch this . I 've run a blood sample , checked reflexes , hormone levels , blood pressure , balance . They 're all normal . I 'm completely the same in every way . My God , it 's unbelievable . Just different . Better . And if I can give powers to anyone , then it 's only a matter of time before I figure out a way to reverse the effects . Take the powers away . Your powers . And this all came from you , Maya . From what 's inside that extraordinary body of yours . You are different . Freeze , Sylar ! Get on the ground ! Freeze ! Now ! Karina and Cruz were two of our best agents . Fine . I 'll own it , Daddy . I screwed up . Sylar got away . And he got to Claire Bennet , making him virtually unstoppable . I can stop him . You know , I can 't help but think about you as a child . When your mother died , your need for approval , affection , was hard to bear . I will find him and I 'll figure out where he 's going to strike next . No , no , why should I keep putting you into a position where you 're just going to be letting me or yourself down again ? That 's not fair to either of us , is it ? Please tell me you 're not getting cold feet . I know we wanted to make a bold move , but Petrelli is a loaded gun . The seat 's been vacant for a month now . As governor , it 's your job to fill it . Doug Hargis is a safer choice . Hargis is a stiff . You 'd be better off leaving Dickenson 's dead carcass in there . All right , if ... If we went with Petrelli , do we really know what we 're buying ? Yeah , the future . Someone who 'd owe you a real debt in a very strategic place . He 's untested . Some say unbalanced . Well , he somehow got elected to Congress from the most populous district in the state . And gave up his seat for personal reasons . Do you really think the press is gonna look the other way ? If we point them in the other direction , yeah . The man was shot , died on the table and lived to talk about it . Who does he credit with this little miracle ? God . God and politics , risky bedfellows . Maybe so , but he 's landing huge on every major media outlet in the country . And the far right is loving him , which fits in nicely with your priorities . Sure , they love him now . You don 't pay me for sex , Governor . I give that for free . What you pay me for is my advice , and my advice to you is to appoint Nathan Petrelli the junior senator from the state of New York . But then again , like I said , it 's your call . We 're ready , sir . Reach out to him . My flight leaves in an hour . Miss Strauss ? The Governor hasn 't made his choice yet . Oh , no , this isn 't about filling the Senate seat . This is about you . Me ? There 's no story with me . Oh , I don 't know . Las Vegas stripper becomes K - Street Ice Queen . Big story . You 're kidding , right ? This isn 't something some grammar school kid couldn 't do with his laptop . No , no , no , I have my sources , they tell me this is you . Your sources are wrong . Why would someone like me do something like that ? That 's exactly what I wanna know . I 'm running this story with or without your comment . You run this story , and I will hunt your ass down and destroy you . It seemed to help last time I made a tape . But this time , it 's different . Because I 'm starting to wonder if I 'm even human anymore . Because if you can 't feel anything , do you still have a soul ? Will I live forever ? All these questions ... I just need to prove that I 'm still alive . So I guess I should just start by saying my name is Claire Bennet , and this is attempt number seven . What are you doing ? What were you doing ? What does it look like ? Trying to get hit by a train ! Just ... I just needed to feel something . What happened to you ? Something awful . He put the top of my head back on and left me there . He can heal now . Yes . I saw it . That wasn 't supposed to happen . What ? And what did he mean I was special , different ? What was he talking about ? What happened to you never should have happened , Claire . It 's my fault . You can 't save me all the time , Peter . What happened was my fault . I can 't defend myself . Yeah , I can heal , but what kind of lame power is that ? I 'm still just a victim . You could teach me . You learned how to use your power and you fought him . Claire ... You could help me do that ! I can 't . Not me . Not now . Why not ? I don 't understand . Because something could go wrong and it changes everything . I need someone to help me . It can 't be me , Claire . I have to be very careful what I say to you . Why ? I 'm sorry , I have to go . For the salvation of my soul , grant me true contrition that I may , day and night , by penance , make satisfaction for my many sins . Speaking of sin ... I 'm sorry . The nurse said that it would be okay if I stopped by . Yeah , no , it 's fine . I was just ... I 'm sorry , I 'm a little bit surprised . What are you doing here ? You 're right , I should have phoned . But I have quite a proposition for you , Congressman . A proposition for me ? No , thanks . I 'm here on behalf of Governor Malden . You work for Malden ? I 'm an advisor to the Governor . And we both agree that you would make an excellent choice to fill the seat left by Gerald Dickenson 's untimely death . Niki , it 's me . What the hell are you talking about ? Did you just call me Niki ? Yeah , Niki . Come on , cut the crap . Wait , do you think that you know me ? The word " biblically " comes to mind . Niki . Niki Sanders . We met in Vegas . Had a pretty good time , if I recall . I think you have me mistaken for another woman , Congressman . My name is Tracy Strauss . You 're not Niki Sanders ? Not in the slightest . And you 're an advisor for the Governor 's office . You can check me out if you like . Okay . And the offer . The Governor wants you , Mr. Petrelli . United States senator . Think about it . My cell number 's on the back . Interesting meeting ? You . You put Niki up to this ? That woman is not Niki Sanders . That 's Tracy Strauss , just like she said . And the offer that she made was quite legitimate . That 's impossible . That woman was Niki Sanders . Perhaps there 's a reason for that . Someone so familiar-Iooking offering you the chance of a lifetime . You should think about that , Nathan . This is God 's plan . You don 't know the first thing about God 's plan . Get out . Nathan , I ... I need my sleep . Dad , I 've been thinking about it . We don 't need to look for Sylar . He 's on the hunt for powers . On Level 5 , he 'd have an all-you-can-eat buffet . Are you even listening to me ? You know , you are so sure that I 'm going to disappoint you , but when I prove you wrong ... Hey , you come to see me , baby , or what ? Screw you ! Elle , it 's me , Peter Petrelli ! You 've got to let me out ! Please ! Let me out of here ! Sylar 's in the building , let 's go . Daddy doesn 't want me to leave my cell . My dad 's dead . Sylar killed him . Hello , Noah . Did you miss me ? Ouch . I got that from your Claire . You son of a bitch . Sylar ! You bastard ! - Jesse ! What 's going on ? - What 's happening ? - Sylar ! What are you doing ? - Jesse ! What 's up ? - What 's going on ? - Jesse , you okay ? Leave her alone ! - Who 's there ? - Sylar ! Leave them alone ! Sylar ! I 'll kill you ! Look what your daddy used to be able to do . You killed him ? I 've killed a lot of people , Elle . You 're as much to blame for that as anyone , maybe even more so . Elle , it 's me , Peter , you okay ? Jesse ! Come on ! We gotta go before they lock us back up ! Where are we going , man ? What 's the plan ? How are you feeling ? Conflicted . I 've been asked to fill the seat left by Senator Dickenson . That 's incredible . Last time I was in a position of authority , I nearly let Manhattan get wiped off the face of the map . Not really sure what that says about my basic nature . You 're different now . Everything 's different . Which is what I came here to talk to you about . I need to show you something . I 'm from the future , Nathan . I came back to kill you . I was the one who shot you . I 've lived for years in a world where people like us have been hunted , slaughtered , used . All because of what you told the world at that press conference . I had to stop that from happening . I 'm not sure how I 'm supposed to respond to this . I came here to save the world , but I don 't think that I have . You sure as hell stopped me from telling everyone . I know . But the future is different now . I 've changed everything . That 's what I 'm trying to say . Why are you telling me this ? I need your forgiveness . If you 're from the future , then what do I do next ? Do I take the offer ? Do I become a senator ? You had a different future where I came from . But I stopped that . Now you 're on the path to being the brother that I always looked up to . You 're gonna make the right choices . Where are you going ? To set things right . Tracy Strauss . Hi , it 's Nathan Petrelli . Listen , I 've given it a lot of thought and I 've decided . I 'd be honored to serve as junior senator from New York . The Governor will be very pleased . But it 's on one condition . I want you on my staff . I 'm not going into this without an ally . If that 's what it takes . We 'll make an announcement at the press conference tomorrow , the whole dog and pony . I assume you 're well enough ? I 'll be fine . Got to run . Expect a call shortly . Congratulations , Senator Petrelli . Hey , story runs tomorrow . You sure you don 't wanna make a comment ? I turn it in , in 15 minutes . That 'll be a serious mistake . This woman in Las Vegas , Niki Sanders , looks like me , she 's not me . Is that all you got ? You wanna tell me that 's not you ? I got this from a friend of mine who works in security at the Corinthian Hotel in Las Vegas . That is you . And , if I 'm not mistaken , that 's Congressman Nathan Petrelli , rumored to be Governor Malden 's choice for Dickenson 's Senate seat . Comment ? It 's not me . You know , I was thinking about running with something like , " K-Street Ice Queen heats up Las Vegas " sleeping with a senator and a congressman . " You can 't run this story . No ! Quite a little mess you 've made here . Mrs. Petrelli , what are you doing here ? With your father 's death , the chain of command falls to me . My father 's body isn 't even cold yet . This is how things work around here , Elle . You should know that . I 'm in charge now , and I 'm starting by making a few changes . I ... We caught Sylar . Good for you . Your electrical outburst also shut down the grid , letting out a dozen inmates who were just as bad or worse . And Noah Bennet is gone , too . I know , and I 'm going to get right on that . No , actually you won 't . I 'm sorry ? We only kept you around this long at your father 's insistence . He 's been protecting you for a long time . And circumstances have obviously changed , and we won 't be needing your services anymore . I have worked for this company my entire life . What am I supposed to do now ? I suppose you 'll have to get yourself another life . What are you doing here ? You have something of mine . And now , I have something of yours . All right , time warp , give it back . You are not faster than me , nemesis . Oh , yeah ? Here , kitty , kitty . I 'm offering you a trade . All right , but my boss isn 't gonna be very happy about this . Your boss ? You know , I was just heading out to get the other half of this . This is a trade between two honorable people . Wrong . You can 't stop me . I 'm taking them both . I can 't let you do that . That formula could destroy the whole world . Is it worth the sacrifice of your friend ? No ! Stop ! What 's happening to me ? Hello . Oh , God . I 'm going insane . That plant there , it will give you water . Thank you , turtle . You saved my life . Why are you talking to a turtle ? Thank you . You come from America . Yes . How did you ... You know Britney Spears ? What ? No . She 's from America . Yeah , yeah . America is a big place . Yes . Africa is , too . Africa ? Come . We walk . Walk ? Walk ? Your cell . I gotta use your cell . I gotta call home . No service here . Should 've gone with Sprint . Listen to me . It 's very important that I get back to America . You gotta help me get back . No . You will stay . You must spirit walk for many miles . Spirit walk ? No , no , no , no . No , I was sent here against my will . I have to find out why . Be patient , Parkman . How do you know my name ? It 's not right that you 're here . Not right at all . Tells me the future is not as I have painted it . The future ? Wait . Are you the one that painted that rock back there ? How do you know the future ? Keep walking , Parkman . Walking . Hey ! Dad ? Thank God you 're home . I was so worried about you . Are you all right ? No . But I 'm better now . You 're not staying , are you ? Something 's happened . Something that I can 't ignore . You made the right choice , my boy . Taking your rook ? Taking the Senate seat . It 's gonna be different this time . I 'm not gonna let you manipulate me . I 'm the one making the decisions . I 'm the one in control . Of course you are . Mr. Petrelli , it 's late . You need your rest . Can 't you see I 'm in the middle of a heated game ? You 're playing yourself ? I 'm obviously playing Mister ... She can 't see me , Nathan . No one can . Except you . Did I not mention that ? Now , whose turn was it again ? Some people are just evil . That 's their nature . His name is Knox . He can absorb a person 's fear and turn it into his own strength . Incredible strength . This guy is a flamethrower . We call this guy the German . He can control magnetic energy . And this guy , Jesse . You don 't want to know . Let 's just say they could destroy us all . You know , even before you were ever born , I 've been finding these people and locking them away so they can 't do any harm . And now , a dozen of them have escaped . They 're out there . And they will kill , and they will terrorize , and they will conspire . And they will cause unimaginable destruction to the world . They 're villains , Claire . And right now , I 'm one of the only people on the planet that knows enough to stop them . That 's why I can 't stay . Then let me come with you . I can be your partner . Claire . I can help . I helped save New York City . You were there . You saw it . I was willing to shoot Peter with your gun when you couldn 't do it . That 's exactly the kind of situation I can 't put you in again . I am doing this so you don 't have to . And what if somebody comes here ? What if somebody comes after me and Mom and Lyle ? I 've thought about that . And I 've called someone to help out while I 'm gone . What 's going on ? You have a lot of questions , Claire . As adoptive parents , there 's only so many we can answer . Mom ? She 's here to make sure you all stay safe . You 're in good hands . Sylar . What are you doing here ? Where is he ? Where did they go ? Escaped . That 's not possible . That never happened ! It 's the butterfly effect , Peter . Just like I told you . I put him here to keep him safe . I put him in the body of the guy in that cell , right there . Jesse ? You 're gonna figure out where my son is , and you 're gonna bring him back here . You understand me ? And then go the hell back where you came from ! This is Nathan Petrelli . Leave a message . Nathan , I don 't even know if you 're alive or not , but if you get this , you need to look out for someone who looks just like me . He 's got a scar on his face , and I think it 's me from the ... Come on , our ride is here . What are you doing ? Just having a little fun , that 's all . You coming ? It 's now or never . My sons have been such a disappointment . But you , I can give you what all boys crave from their mothers . Inspiration and guidance , comfort . Isn 't that right , Gabriel ? My name is Sylar . And you are not my mother . But I am , dear . I am .

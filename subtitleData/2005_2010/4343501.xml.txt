 Previously on Heroes ... - What happened to your parents ? - I touched them , they died . I know about your power , and I know you 're not a killer , you 're a healer . You 're staying here ? How long ? Until I know you 're all right . I 'm Becky Taylor . Open rush starts today at the house . What don 't you come by ? I 'm missing bid night , uncle Samuel . Checking on your work with Claire Bennet . You 're doing everything to isolate her , push other people away , push her in our direction ? I remember flying . I flew jets in the military , maybe . - What name pops into your head ? - Call me Nathan . I have a crush . Please accept this bid to join the Psi Alpha Chi sisterhood . You need to undo what you did . Give me back my body and I will be happy ... You 're a killer , I 'm a cop . If I have to keep you trapped inside for the rest of my life , so be it . That was amazing . You are amazing . Forbidden fruit . My favorite kind . Sheriff ? - You can 't do this . - Is that right ? You say you 're a family friend . Now , you 're a lawyer ? - Jeremy lost his parents . - My point , exactly . You saw the broken heater . You can 't lock him up like a killer . - You know this was and accident . - What I know ... is that two people are dead . And that boy ... Let 's just say ... it 's not the first time he 's made some trouble in my town . - He 's building up quite the rap sheet . - Are you pressing charges ? That kid ain 't going anywhere until I finish my investigation . And if and when that happens , I 'm not releasing him to anyone who 's not the next of kin . And that is not you , friend . You have yourself a nice evening now . It 's me . I need your help . I can get a latte here no problem , right ? I saw a cow about a mile back . Get some espresso , we 're in business . Thanks for coming . I didn 't know if you 'd show . - Who is your fallback ? - Don 't have one . Then I 'm honored . So , you found a kid with abilities ? I thought you were done with the bag-and-tag business . This is more of a rescue mission . His name 's Jeremy , 17 years old . He has ... a dual ability . Life and death . He got into an argument with his parents , and ... - He killed them ? - An accident . His emotions got the better of him . We all know that can happen . Is that why you called me ? Not entirely . They won 't release him , I 'm not family , but it turns out ... that the kid is very fond ... of his ant Tracy . Just go in , talk to him , sign him out . - I don 't know . - He 's got nobody . You 've been there . You awake ? - You ? - Yep . You 're afraid I 'm gonna kiss-attack you in your sleep ? Maybe . We should talk about this . Yeah , I guess we should . It was stupid and impulsive and bad . It wasn 't bad . I mean , you 're a good kisser . I just ... I don 't want to mess this up . Mess what up ? My new totally ordinary life . You know , the one I 'm still chasing ? You 're the first real friend I 've had since I left Texas , and ... that 's a big deal for me . And I really like you a lot . Just ... not in that way ? Jeez , Claire . You don 't have to go all Buffy on us . We 're just kidnapping you . I am so sorry . Do you want to be an Alpha Chi or not ? Is that a trick question ? - Where are you taking us ? - Well , if I told you , that wouldn 't be a very good kidnapping , would it ? Cannot believe that they shoved us in the trunk . So lame . Look at us . All tied up in the dark . You know , they have entire websites devoted to this . Sorry . So , you were saying how you didn 't really like me that way ? You were saying that . I was saying that you 've been a great friend . So , which way is it ? I don 't know . What does that mean ? It means I don 't know . Awesome . Good morning . Welcome to hell week . All right , ladies , listen up . This is what we call a screaming scavenger hunt . There 's a big Alpha Chi treasure close by . Whichever team finds it first gets to sit out hell week . Trust me , you want to sit out . We 've got goldfish . Good luck ! But remember , ladies , someone 's got to win and someone 's got to lose . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Where are we ? Thank you . My name 's Tracy . I 'm a friend of Mr. Bennet 's . How 'd you get in here ? We told them that I was your aunt . My aunt ? I don 't have an aunt . You do now . Mr. Bennet fixed some paperwork and here I am . Mr. Bennet said that everything would go away ... That the cops would buy the story . Mr. Bennet ... said they 'd let me go . All I have to do is sign you out . That might not be such a good idea . Why not ? I killed my parents . I 'm a murderer . You can 't control me . You 've never been able to do that . I had a compelling reason . Let 's face it . - Your wife is kind of hot . - Enough ! That is the second Parkman I made scream today . If you want , I can give you some pointers later . Crazy psycho ! What are you gonna do ? Hit me ? Defend your lady 's honor ? We both know it 's not about that . It 's about all those other things I can do to her ... And Matty , next time I take over your body . That 's when the real fun begins . Cozy . Oh , my God . Do you smell that ? It smells like something died in here . - What is this place ? - Oh , my God . Slaughterhouse . Oh , my ... Please , don 't say that again . Hey , guys ? Super-cute puzzle over here . " What you find will help you survive . " " When we were found will keep you alive . " " When we were found " ? Okay , let 's just open one , so we can get out of here . Wait ! Oh , my God . Relax . It 's not real . They 're just trying to scare us . Open 24 . How do you know ? " When we were found , " 1924 . That 's when the sorority was founded . You know that ? My mom 's a former sister . Remember ? Thank God . I am so thirsty . One bottle per team . No problem . Come on , Ash . They won the first round . Now we are going to bring it . Can I just stay here ? What happened with your parents ... I understand . All you did was touch them . The day that I discovered my ability , I killed a man . He was threatening me . I grabbed him and ... something took over . Something inside of me . And no matter how hard I tried ... You couldn 't let go . Your emotions took over . You got mad . For most people , that 's not a bad thing . We 're not most people . I 'm gonna get you out of here . His next of kin is here . What reason do you still have ? Well , we got plenty . Is this Jeremy 's ? Gil , show him what we found . " I feel the darkness surrounding me . " I am the bringer of death . " He 's 17 years old . The songs in his iPod sound like that . I should read you the part about killing animals . Any kid at school will tell you he does it , for fun . So now we 're taking gossip as evidence , is that it ? There 's something wrong with that boy . Far as I 'm concerned , this proves it . He ain 't getting away with killing his family . He 's staying right here . No , they still haven 't charged him . Their evidence is circumstantial at best . Yes , right now . I 'm calling in a favor , Denis . Thank you . All right , I 'll see you then . Sounds like you 're shaking things up in there . From the looks of the place , they could use it . - Is that right ? - Tell me something . How 's a girl like you end up in a place like this ? - You have to do better than that . - The name is Samuel . I 'm here to ask you one question . If you 're here to save young Jeremy 's life , then what 's next ? You gonna take him to a place just to live ? Or where he belongs ? - What did you do ? - It 's all right . - Stay back . - I 'm a friend , Tracy . - How do you know my name ? - It 's all right . You 're safe here . I 'm like you . We 're all like you . Where is this ? Home . Slaughter floor or operation center ? Should I even ask ? Have a nice hell week . After you . - So , how long have you known ? - Known what ? That I really don 't want to be in this sorority ? That you like girls . You make it sound like I have to declare , like , it 's my major or something . I 'm actually jealous . First year of college and you 've already figured yourself out . I don 't know about that . Truth is I 've had more boyfriends than girlfriends . Really ? How many more ? Six or seven . That 's not a lot , right ? Sounds about right . You 're not ... No , you couldn 't be . You were a cheerleader . Not what ? A virgin ? We could not be more different . Maybe we 're strange attractors . - Strange attractors ? - It 's a physics thing . Everything in the universe has a magnetic charge . So strange attractors are particles that end up together that don 't belong together , but together , they 're super-powerful . Sort of like we could be ? Or not . What ? Hold on . Come on . Don 't tell me you 're freaked out now . I mean , look . See ? Nothing . Just more lameness . What the hell was that ? I 'm starting to think this isn 't a game . This is the life Jeremy could have . What ? Working at a carnival ? Surrounded by family . His true family . Do you remember the first time you experienced your gift ? " Gift " might be a little generous . Like the entire universe coursing through you all at once . That wasn 't just your ability , Tracy . You were tapping into something greater than yourself . We 're all connected . - I 'd like to believe that . - Believe it . Every time someone joins this family , I get a feeling in here . It 's an energy , I guess . It gets stronger every day . This is where Jeremy should be . What , living in trailers , drifting from town to town ? What would you do ? Give him a false name ? A false life ? This is a boy who can work miracles . Why should he be invisible ? Bring him home ! You could join him . I know you 've been lost too . It 's your nature . That 's enough . Just take me back now . Fair enough . Look , I 'm never out the hard sell , but please take this to find your way back here . This is Lydia . She 'll take you from here . I know her . I helped her . She came to me when she was sad . I held her in my arms . We were flying . We 've talked about this . Those memories are not yours . Then whose are they ? And if the real me isn 't in here ... Where am I ? Matt , what are you doing ? I have to leave . It 's not safe for you and Matty . Why ? Because ... Someone else can control me . - My body . - Someone else ? Why do you always do this ? Come on . We 're getting close . We 're going on 15 years and you blow everything up again ? Look , I did a terrible thing . - This should be good . - I used my ability to push one man 's memories into another man 's head . Yeah , my head . There is somebody using my body without my permission . - I didn 't know you could do that . - It was wrong . I know that . But I had to do it to get rid of this really bad criminal . - That 's not very nice ... - Or at least just his mind . And now his consciousness is rattling around up in here . - There 's so much space . - Shut up ! Look . I can get rid of him . - The answer 's out there . I 'll find it . - Good luck . - I need you to trust me , okay ? - I 'm gonna give you guys a moment . - You trust me , right ? - Do your thing . You said it yourself . Fifteen years are worth something . I can fix this . You need a place to work things out . You should stay here . I insist . It 's safer for you here . I 'll take Matty and we 'll go and stay with ... Don 't ! Don 't tell me . I don 't want him to hear . All right . - I love you . - That 's good . That was pretty smart even for you , not letting her tell me where she 's gonna be . But you still haven 't figured out how to get rid of me , genius . Mohinder . I have no idea where you are . Will you do me a favor ? Call me back , okay ? When you get this , just call me . Mohinder ? How 's he gonna help ? He 's probably working on his father 's research . Why don 't you try your old lady ? See if she picks up . Forget it . It is time to give me back my body and just ... Accept it . I 'm ... gaining ground and I ... I can ... make you do whatever ... - I want . - Yeah ? This is hurting you a little bit ? You wish . You know , you 're right . I mean , you slept with my wife . You can control me at any time , right ? All right . Control me . Stop me from drinking this beer . Come on . Come on ! Stop me ! Why don 't we see ... how you do ... Against the heavy artillery . Wait . I think I 've finally found a leash for this dog . There you are . Your guy came through . - He made all the arrangements . - That 's great . - You all right ? - Yeah . Let 's just get him out of here . Thanks . Jeremy , they 're letting you go . But who am I gonna live with ? You 'll be a few doors down from me in my apartment building in D.C. I 've set up a new identity for you . Your name is Jarod Mitchell and you attend Georgetown high school . So nobody will know what I can do ? You 'll learn to control your ability with Tracy 's help . But you 're gonna keep it to yourself . It 's the only way . What if something happens ? Nothing 's going to happen . You 'll be safe . You 'll be invisible . What , you think a sorority brought us out here to kill us ? That 's ridiculous . It 's just a game . It didn 't just move itself . There was no one else there . How else would you explain it ? - In my world , there 's a million ways . - Name one . Telekinesis . I 've seen it . Heck , I know someone who has it . So wait , you 're saying there 's another one of you here ? It 's very possible . And what ? They 're playing a college prank on you ? Not a prank . You think that they 're trying to kill you ? Not me . Then who ? Me ? Come on . Think about it . My first roommate committed suicide with a mysterious note that wasn 't there , but then it was . Maybe you almost getting gutted wasn 't a coincidence . Claire , that is a little out there . Sounds like some crazy-ass conspiracy theory . Which pretty much describes your entire life . What was that ? I don 't know . Ash , cut it out . Come on . You guys all right ? - You find another clue ? - Like I 'm gonna tell you . Look , your roommate 's freaked out and we don 't care about the treasure . Let 's stick together , get the hell out of here , and once we find it , you can have it . Deal ? - Okay , can we just go ? - Deal . Lead the way . Take my car . Straight ahead . We know what happened to your parents ! We know what you did ! We know what you did . You 're getting away with murder , you ... Don 't hurt him ! Jeremy , stop . Let him go . Get the hell away from him ! Jeremy , you can save him ! - Everyone back ! Back ! - Listen to me . - You can help him . You can save him . - Everybody stand back ! Now listen , son . You 're going back in there . You know what you did to your mama and your daddy . Save him . You can do it . You have no idea what 's happening here . Three people are dead . I understand that . And that boy , whatever he is , is responsible ! Do you want it to happen again ? Let me talk to him . Talk to him ? You 're through talking to him . Both of you . You think killers go free ? Not in this town . Gil , where 's the boy ? Gil , do you read ? The boy is gone . Gil , do you read me ? Are you there ? Not so tough now , are you ? Go ahead . Take your best shot . Give me a reason . You 're not normal . You don 't belong here . Go . You like that ? You know what this is ? I bought this ... with Janice , on our anniversary trip to Ensenada . And it is so poetic that I am using it to bury you . Bury me or drown the truth ? The truth , what ? That you ... you 're nothing ? You 're just a figment of my imagination . Let 's quiet those voices , shall we ? Your wife walked out on you . You think she wanted to give you your space . She can 't stand the sight of you . Pathetic . You know what she said to me , in front of the fire last night ? " Why can 't you be more like this all the time ? " When you 're gone ... Janice and I are gonna have a beautiful life together . You 're so desperate to fit in . Why can 't you accept your power ? Why do you insist on being ... so forgettable ? Man . You 're afraid . You 're afraid of dying . And you just passed out . You just passed out . Yes ! Honey , I did it . I really did it . " Kill house . " " Prep room . " " Kill house " sounds more dangerous . We 're taking that one . I thought we were gonna stick together . No way . Let 's just check this real quick . We 'll catch up to them . Well , we won . Kind of . I 'm gonna go get Paris and Nicole . - I get it , by the way . - You get what ? You wanting to run from your freaky world and live a normal life . I shouldn 't have put you on the spot and gotten all relationship-y on you . - The last thing you need right now ... - I need you . Trust me . What ? What 's going on ? Oh , my God ! Claire ! Oh ... My ... God ! Becky ? Grab her ! A little help , please ? Oh , my God . Don 't do it ! Stop ! No , stop ! - What the ... - What ? How did you ... What 's happening ? What are we gonna do ? We could have saved him . He needed a home . A real home . Tracy , I 'm sorry . You know , this was supposed to be simple . Just go in and sign him out . I thought I could manage . By hiding him away for the rest of his life ? I stood on his porch and I told him that I wouldn 't let him down . But you did . We did . I did what I thought was right . And I was wrong . I 've been wrong all these years . Do we have to be invisible ? You ever think we could just live , Noah ? Out in the open ? Not after today , no . Don 't ever call me again . You gave us quite a scare there , brother . I know . I 'm sorry . I just ... I had to see if ... If I could ... I 'm much better now . Not quite . We start over ... from the beginning . You hear me ? Thanks . Both of you . I love you . You 'll love me a lot more after I take a shower . Let me guess . You want your body back ? Did you think you were actually winning ? The second you blacked out , I slipped right in . Now I 'm in the driver 's seat . You 'll never get away with this . I already have .

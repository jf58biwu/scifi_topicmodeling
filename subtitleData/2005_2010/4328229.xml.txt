 Torchwood , outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on earth , arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes ... and you 've got to be ready . This programme contains some strong language . Hello there . Apologies for the unplanned touchdown , just hit some rotten turbulence . I 'm Captain Jack Harkness . Diane Holmes , pilot . Is this some sort of secret base ? You must show me round one day . Everything all right ? How long before we head off again ? My Uncle 's expecting me . When did you leave ? About half an hour ago . Which date ? Today , December the 18th . Which year ? Which year ? Which year ? I need to know . 1953 . There 's no need to be frightened . Who are you exactly ? The least you know about us , the better . Meet the team . Toshiko . Gwen . Doctor Owen Harper . John Ellis . Emma Louise Cowell . Diane Holmes . Please , follow me . At least it wasn 't a spaceship full of aliens . That might have been easier . But how can you travel 50 years in half an hour ? Your aircraft slipped through a transcendental portal . A what ? A door in time and space . It 's some kind of trick , it has to be . Tosh ? Celebrations of the Millennium in your respective home cities , photographs documenting the development of Cardiff Bay from the ' 50s to the present day , blueprints of modern day aeroplanes . But if all this is true ... then how do we get back ? You don 't . According to history , your plane never returned . I 'm sorry . What 's going to happen to us ? Never mind about us . What happened to everyone else ? Our families . Your father died in 1959 . He was 48 . Dad said he 'd die young . All the men in the munitions factory did . Your mother lived till she was 81 though . I know this is hard to take in . But is there anyone else ? My son , Alan Ellis . He was born on the 6th of April , 1937 , 14 Park Place , Grangetown . He might still be alive . The archives in the ' 50s weren 't that well documented . We 'll try again tomorrow . Right now , you need to get some sleep . Friends ? Boyfriend ? Not really . Never stayed in one place long enough . It 's a bit basic . Not when you 've slept in barracks . I was going to close a deal on a shop in Dublin tomorrow . What do you trade in ? Food , knick-knacks , essentials . What are you after ? Bit of music . RADIO PLAYS BEETHOVEN 'S MOONLIGHT SONATA There 's photographs of my family in here . I 'll see what I can do . Don 't worry , Captain Harkness , I 'll look after the ladies . Call me Jack . DISTANT LAUGHING Who else is here ? Couple of young girls . Pretty dress . Thank you . I made it myself . Where are you from ? Bristol . What were you going to Dublin for ? Auntie Nora 's ill and Uncle Finn can 't manage the children . It will be good practice for when I have children of my own , Mum says . She 's gone next door so Uncle Finn can telephone ... She 'll know I 'm missing by now . Emma , she found out in 1953 . Over 50 years have passed , remember ? What will she think happened ? It must have been like one of those murders where they never find the body . They seemed to think the plane went down in the sea . These will be your means of identification . We 've set up bank accounts for you but we 'll give you an allowance so you can practice with the currency and money management . David Ward . Sally-Anne Hope . Deborah Morrison , and it 's spelt how Deborah Kerr spells it . Your background stories should incorporate your skills . John , you could have run a corner shop . No . We can fake references . You can 't take away our names . For God 's sake , it 's all we 've got left . It 's my son 's name , it 's the name above my shop . You 're right . I didn 't think . You should keep your name . I 'd suggest you use £ 25 for your food and then £ 20 for luxuries like cigarettes , magazines . My dad only made £ 10 a week ! Things are a lot more expensive now . How did it do that ? It 's automatic . It knows you 're there . But how ? There are wave bouncing detectors which emit radio waves and then look for reflections ... Bananas ! Of course , bananas are far more interesting . Look at all this ! We 'd just come off rationing in ' 53 . Yes , sorry , we are a consumer society . It 's bloody fantastic . How much food money have I got left ? £ 15.40 . £ 12.10 . You 'll ruin your teeth . You sound like my mum . They sell films in boxes and you can watch them at home . I love going to the pictures . Good God . Welcome to the wonderful world of scantily-dressed celebrities . " Super Excel Waterproof Luscious Lashes Mascara " . I 've got to have that . There 's children around . She 's a children 's TV presenter . So you like the musicals ? My best friend , Kate , and I saw Calamity Jane five times . I 've got the LP . You all right ? What does that mean ? I 'm just going to take a look at the stadium . You girls stick together now . I 'll be back for supper . Excuse me . Do you know a man called Alan Ellis ? He used to live here . No , sorry , mate . I 'm going to check on the plane this afternoon . Want to come ? I 'm going to watch this . And maybe make some paper chains . Wonder what work I can get in aviation . I 'm going to have to find a husband . LAUGHTER All right ? I 'm Alesha , this is Jade . All right . I 'm Emma . Diane . Excuse me , have to get ready . Where d 'you get those shoes ? They 're lush . Thanks . Hello , old girl , d 'you miss me ? I 've been reading up on you . England to Australia in four days , 1952 , that is impressive . Yeah , terrible wind across the Bengal Bay . Something you ate ? So , how did you get into this ? Ferried planes during the war . Of course , when it was over , we were supposed to revert to being dutiful wives and daughters . But I 'd got the taste for it . No pig-headed man tells me what to do . Ah . " Sky Gipsy " ? After the engine . The de Havilland Gipsy Six - a work of genius . Tuned with a higher compression ratio to squeeze more energy from its fuel mixture . Can I take her up ? No , you could get arrested . You haven 't got a licence . But I ... Bugger , it 's no longer valid . I guess I 'm just another pig-headed man telling you what to do . Well , you 'd better make it up to me . I want to learn all about this new world . Blackpool were 3-1 down , then Stanley Matthews worked his magic - scored two goals in the last 20 minutes . Bolton lost 4-3 . My boy was on his knees , punching the air ... The FA cup final live in my own living room . I charged the lads a shilling each to come and watch . Ever the business man , eh , John ? That 's an American accent , isn 't it ? That 's right . So how did you end up here , doing whatever it is that you do ? It 's a long story . I 'm a slow drinker . You know everything about me . What 's the problem ? Gets kinda complicated . What , did you fall through time too ? Yeah , you could say that . Sorry , mate , you can 't smoke in here . What are you doing Christmas Eve ? We could go carol singing . THEY ALL LAUGH I 'll be getting hammered . Where are your families ? No idea . We grew up in care . Like a children 's home ? I haven 't got anyone else either . What happened to you ? My parents are dead , so I came down here to start afresh . So they didn 't leave you a house or anything ? No . I 've got nothing . Were you close to them ? Yes . I loved them very much . Must have been an awful Christmas for them , thinking I 'd drowned . I just want to know what kind of life he had , my son . He might have kids . I could be passing my own flesh and blood in the street . Find him , Jack , he 's all I 've got left . Cheers . What ? I 'm waiting for you to pull out my chair . Let me get this straight . You expect equality AND chivalry ? I don 't see why they should be mutually exclusive . Well , if it makes you happy . Your chair , ma 'am . Thank you . So what other strides have women made ? Well , on the strange but true , how about this , you don 't have to have sex to have kids any more . What ? How come ? Get yourself inseminated , with a sort of syringe , cheery little process . Seriously , men donate sperm anonymously . A little shuffle into a pot at a sperm bank . And they say romance is dead . Oh , come on , I wasn 't born yesterday . No , but for a bird who 's going on 90 you look pretty hot . What was your favourite song ? Well , it 's hard to say . I know what mine was . # I just blew in from the windy city The windy city is mighty pretty # But they ain 't got what we got I 'm tellin ' ya , boys ! # What do you think you 're playing at ? I thought I could trust you to behave . Where do you want to go now ? Well , I 'm in your hands . Well , we could go back to mine . You could read up about yourself on the net . That sounds like a line . It 's not a line , I 'm not chatting you up . Not because I don 't think you 're attractive , but because I wouldn 't want you to think I was taking advantage of you . Got any Scotch ? I don 't see why she got you involved . She was upset . She was drinking . I only had half a glass . Enough to make a show of yourself . We 're not meant to draw attention to ourselves . We 're not the same as them . We can 't trust anyone . Will you be OK now , Emma ? Don 't worry , I won 't let her out of my sight again . I don 't like liver . Sit down , young lady , and be grateful for what you 're given . And why should I listen to you ? Emma ? Only my dad gets to talk to me like that ... and I 'm never going to see him again , am I ? Or my mum , or my best friend , or my dog and I miss them ... and I hate this filthy , stinking place ! I never had this sort of trouble with my son . Woman have been to space too , y 'know . You 've got a lot of catching up to do . Do you have a girlfriend ? No . So who do all those beauty products belong to ? Me , actually . No ? Oi , real men can moisturize too , you know . It 's not very homely here . No , I 'm not here that much , it doesn 't seem worth the effort . You smoke too much . So I gather . Amelia Earhart ... she disappeared in 1932 . Do you think she 's still out there somewhere ? No , doubt it . One in a zillion chance , you ending up here . A whole new world . Oh , it 's not so bad , once you get used to it . I reckon you 'll fit in just fine . I 'm glad you haven 't got a girlfriend . Me too . # .. Come around and knock me down again # Worry # Oh , worry , worry , worry , worry ... # I take it that wasn 't your first time ? I had a lover . He was married . And you didn 't care ? Well , I was free to do what I liked and I didn 't have to cook and clean for him . It suited me . I 'm not exactly marriage material . I always thought the ' 50s were uptight , sexually repressed and ... You didn 't invent it , you know . Oh ? ! Can we do it again ? Don 't see why not . We could have an affair . We could be fuck buddies . What 's a fuck buddy ? It 's , um , it 's a friend that you have casual sex with . There 's nothing casual about what we just did . Oh , no , no , I didn 't mean that . Sex shouldn 't be devalued . Both parties should give it 100 % concentration . Because when you take off together ... It 's the next best thing to flying . SHE SCREAMS Emma is my auntie 's step-daughter . She meant to spend Christmas in Cardiff with a friend but they had this awful argument last night and she rang me . Got my number from Mum . The thing is , she doesn 't really want to go back home so I thought ... I thought maybe , she could stay with us . We 've got a lot to catch up on . For Christmas ? GWEN MOUTHS I 'd better get a bigger turkey . Thanks . This is Rhys , my long-suffering boyfriend . He lives here . Don 't your parents mind ? Emma 's parents are a bit religious . Oh , better not tell them you saw my morning glory then , eh ? The thing is I couldn 't tell him your parents were dead . He 'd ask too many questions . The thing is , he doesn 't know exactly what I do . We can 't expect John and Diane to look after her . They 're strangers . I had to take her in . Diane didn 't even come home last night . I think she was in a BB . I 'll take her job-hunting later . Jack , John 's son . I think I 've found him . Come and meet Alan , though I 'm not sure how much help he 'll be to you . Alan , there 's someone here to see you . He 's a nephew on your father 's side . He 's been tracking down the family history . Is Sally coming ? Sally 's his wife . She passed away a while back . Sorry , this isn 't one of his better days . What 's wrong with him ? Alzheimer 's . What 's that ? He 's senile . He doesn 't remember who he is most of the time . Couldn 't live at home any more . He 'd leave hobs on , forget to dress , you know . He never had any children so there was no-one there to look after him . That 's you and your dad playing footie out the back . That 's your dad and your mum and your new television set . When can I go home ? You 're not well enough , love . I don 't like it here . They took my clothes . I 'll have a word , they 're in the wash . Keeps me going , this one . What did he do , for a living ? Was he in retail ? I think he was a fireman . That 's what I did . In the war . £ 60 for half an hour ! No worries . I 'll pay . A Cessna ! Oh , it 's my first plane . I bought one after the war , they 've hardly changed . Dream to fly . We 'll soon get you back behind the ... throttle . Thanks , Owen . Matthews did three set-ups in 20 minutes , then Bill Perry cracked home the winner . You said he had wings on his feet and that 's why he was called a winger . You used to say clever things like that . Blackpool won . Yes ! Alan , it 's me , your dad . I bought you that football annual you wanted for Christmas , Alan . It was in my desk drawer . Alan , please ... Everything all right ? He remembered who won the FA Cup final when he was a boy . He sometimes remembers snippets from his childhood . It 's quite common with dementia . When 's Dad coming , Mum ? I 'm not your mum , love . Alan ? Who are you ? John 's witnessing the end of his world , the end of his line . And we can 't help . There 's no puzzle to solve , no enemy to fight ... just three lost people who have somehow become our responsibility . Best I can do is Friday 29th , three o 'clock . Can 't you take her up today ? Fully booked . It 's all right , I 've flown for years . I can go on my own . Not without a licence , sorry . Maybe you could cancel someone ? We 'll pay extra . I couldn 't do that do my regulars . Look , it 's fine . Book me in for the 29th . It 's Diane Holmes . Diane , I 'm really sorry . I should have called ahead . Oh , for goodness ' sake , this is so silly . It 's just I was really looking forward ... Ignore me . Let 's get out of here . " I See You Baby " by Groove Armada Do you think she 'll be all right though ? I don 't think she 's even had a proper boyfriend . Stop fussing . She 'll be fine , man . What was that for ? For putting up with me . I deserve a lot more for doing that . Oi ! Hands off ! Go back to your friends , good boy . What are you playing at ? I wouldn 't let him do anything . You might not have had much choice . Gwen , you 're over-reacting . I was just having a kiss and a cuddle . He was after a lot more than that . This is ... disgusting . I just want you to know that people are more sexually aware these days . Then maybe you 'll be more careful . Mum said that no man wants to marry soiled goods . Attitudes have changed . As long as it 's safe and between two consenting adults , no-one cares . So ... how many men have you done it with ? A few . Were you in love with all of them ? No . Sex can just be about having a good time together . If you 're in the right mood , with the right guy , it 's the best , no big deal . So if I meet a boy and we get on , and he wants sex , then you think I should let him ? No , no , that 's not what I said . What are you saying ? Sex ... is nothing to be ashamed of . And as for you , well , your first time should be with someone special . Do you wish you 'd waited for Rhys ? He 's your special someone , isn 't he ? Yes ... Yes , I suppose . And I bet sex with him is better than with the others . Well ... I will wait for Mr Right , I think . I 'm really not the kind of girl who sleeps around . I 'm going to brush my teeth . Thanks for the chat . Not a problem . Leave it . I can 't if I want to fly a jet plane , because that 's all flying is now - pressing buttons . You used to have to know how to fix an engine , how to gauge the wind but ... Leave it . Open this . Oh ! It 's beautiful . Well , how did it go ? This coat I 'm wearing is their latest fashion , ' 50s inspired . They offered me a job on the spot . Oh , that 's brilliant . Oh ! Now we need to find you a flat near here . The shop 's in a new branch in London . I 've always dreamt about working in a London fashion house . They open the day after Boxing Day . I 'll be a shop girl and a trainee buyer . I can house share . They 've given me numbers . London 's a big city . That 's what my mum used to say . There 's no rush . There 's nothing to keep me here . I 'm sure we can find you something in Cardiff . You keep looking . Need to make a plan , get work , get my driving licence . It will all help . Thanks , Jack . I was looking for a bus timetable . Want to get out to the DIY stores , see if there 's any work going . Best of luck ! Thank you . Where are you taking me ? We 're here . Bear with me . We have had such a girly day shopping . What 's up ? Your mum rang . Funny thing , she 's no idea who Emma is . No ? And I 'm thinking back to you and me on the couch ... Work calls , you go out in the middle of the night and come back with a surprise relative . So , let 's have it , who exactly is Pollyanna ? Ah , is it to do with work ? It 's so hard to explain . Do you even know her ? She was lost . I 'm sorry . What worries me is how easy it is for you to lie to me . It 's my fault . I 'll leave by tomorrow . You don 't have to go . She 's 18 years old . I couldn 't turn my back on her . It 's like two separate worlds - there 's Torchwood , and then there 's real life . That 's why you 've got to let me go . I , er , couldn 't help noticing you standing out here in that beautiful dress . This beautiful dress is a gift from my lover . Then he is a fool to let you go out in it alone . What shall we drink to ? Chance meetings . # Oh , the good life # Full of fun # Seems to be the ideal # Mm , the good life # Lets you hide all the sadness you feel # You won 't really fall in love # For you can 't take the chance # So please be honest # With yourself ... # Let 's go home . # It 's the good life # To be free # And explore the unknown ... # MOBILE RINGS # Like the heart aches # When you learn you must face them alone ... # Hello ? My car keys are missing . John was behind the counter earlier on and I can 't get hold of him . He 's gone home . John ! John ! Let me go ! You can 't just throw it away , not without trying . I 'm not as strong as you . You don 't understand . I do . I was born in the future . Lived in your past . My time is gone too . Why are you doing this ? Speaking to me in bloody riddles , keeping me here when my wife is dead , my son is a shell . John , you 're still young . You can get work , make friends , start a family . I did all that , Jack . Years ago . When I was meant to . I wish I could say something . There 's nothing to say or do . I can 't leave you here . Then we 'll wait . The sun will rise , we 'll have some breakfast , take a walk . Yes . A new day . And I 'll suffer it all and smile and wag my tail . And then , as soon as your back is turned , I 'll make sure I do it properly . Because I want to die . You don 't get reunited , John . It just goes black . How do you know ? I died once . Who are you ? A man , like you , out of his time , alone and scared . How do you cope ? It 's just bearable . It has to be . I don 't have a choice . But I do . If you want to help me , let me go with some dignity . Don 't condemn me to live . Are you scared ? Yes . You 're very quiet . I don 't know if I can do this anymore . This isn 't how it works for me . I 've slept with enough women , I 've done the fuck buddies thing . This is not it . I can 't concentrate . All I see is you , all I can think about is what you 're wearing , what you 're thinking , what your face looks like when you come . It 's been , what , a week ? And it 's like , when I 'm not with you , um , I 'm out of focus . How have you done this to me ? I 'm scared . I 'm fucking scared . I love you too . The thing about love ... is that you 're always at its mercy . Emma , these are your tickets , OK ? On the back is your seat number , keep this with you at all times . I 've also got you a return just in case . Now don 't go talking to any strangers and phone me as soon as you get there , OK ? No ! I 'm not letting you do this . I 'm not a possession , Owen . You can 't do this , it 's madness . If I listened to everyone who told me that , I wouldn 't have broken any records . You don 't have to go . If I don 't , then I 'll always wonder what it 's like . London , Gwen . You 're not thinking straight , let 's talk about it . No , I 'm sorry . We can make this work . You belong here now , with me . I belong in the sky . Well , we can get you up in the sky . Soon you can fly whenever you want . Look , weather conditions are the same as the day we arrived . That rift will open again , I can feel it . Diane , listen to me , there is no way back . You cannot get home . Then it will take me somewhere new . Merry Christmas ! I 'll come with you . I fly solo , Owen . I go faster and further than others . We have no idea how this rift works . You can end up anywhere . That 's the beauty of it . It 's too dangerous ! It 's what I do . What about me ? ! Please , please , don 't go . What memories I 'm taking with me . Merry Christmas . 'Because when you take off together , 'it 's the next best thing to flying . ' Somebody 's not only kidnapping weevils , they 're causing them pain . These guys are using weevils to carry out the perfect murder . You want to release a weevil in the middle of Cardiff ? ! I 've been having sex with someone else . His name 's Owen . Who are you , Owen Harper ? We 're gonna hunt you down and we 're gonna make you surrender that creature that you kidnapped . Out there in the darkness , something is coming .

A library . And have you read them all ? Some . How did you get them ? I 've been keeping them , secretly . The regime fears the power of knowledge . Even though , the real danger is ignorance . Ignorance about the real effects of TECPANOL . Ignorance about what they really keep in those Cryo-pause warehouses . A medical center for the study of human anatomy , as they proclaim . No . They 've got brilliant minds there . Politicians , scientists , intellectuals . Useful people for the regime 's goals . They change the mind of some and then We must do something , Pablo . We 've got to rescue a military strategist ... since the beginning . He can unite the movement . And we need you there . But , why me ? You have access to the blueprints of the Cryo-pause warehouses . And to the access codes . And because that strategist is Goros . - What ? My father is there ? - Yes , Pablo . Let 's celebrate life ! Let 's see inside ourselves to heal our heart of selfishness apathy indifference and arrogance . Great Father , share Your strength with us to achieve a world with greater justice where each one of us is treated as individual So be it ! Ready ? - Yes . A soldier is approaching . Stay calm . All the way to the end . First code ? Now ! The codes ! Try 2-26 . Okay , try 2-26 . We did it ! What 're you doing ? Stop bothering me . Easy , Pablito . You 've been very stressed lately . Pablo ? Pablo , answer ! Relax . Answer me , Pablo ! - Stop working . How about we go for some drinks ? Or , what do you want to do ? Go Zorpa-hunting ? You tell me . I 'll catch up with you later . Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Sorry . Are you sure it 's here ? It 's alphabetical . No ! Yes . It 's me . Just a bit older . Do you remember the war ? Do you remember the attack on the Transition Palace ? Pablo , your son ? The boy , the boy ! The movement ? The kid , Miguel ! - I 'll get him ! We 're in a safe place . It 's the year 2033 . We thought you were dead until , not that long ago we discovered they had you in Cryo-pause . A sort of frozen state . Rest . What were you doing in that neighborhood ? Which one ? Son , please , stop being silly . Go back to your training with Benavides ! What 's this ? What are you doing to me ? We don 't want anything bad happening to you . You know what ? You 're a key piece in this . What ? What are you trying to tell me , Miguel ? We want you to organize the people the militia in the city . Look at me . Give me time . There 's no time . Jamaro is now the president and he has control over Villaparaiso , the capital . And over other territories throughout the country . Jamaro ? Easy ! Easy . It 's the effects of the Cryo-pause . I 'm scared . Your son was scared too . But thanks to him , you 're here now . My son ? Yes . Your son , Pablo . Pablo . Are you in ? We 'll form three fronts . In the east , Father Vega The north will be under commander Mariscal . We will have to take care of the central and southern zones . The main objective will be Pharmax . Second the Cryo-pause warehouses . No matter how long the storm lasts the sun always comes out again from among the clouds . " Khalil Gibran said that . And here too , the sun will come out again , among us . Goros . What ? Nothing . How did you meet Father Miguel ? Some time ago . A little after my father died , when PEC attacked the Congress . And your mom ? - They killed her too . They used her for experiments . My brother and I were very young . We ate rats to survive . Until one day Father Miguel came . I don 't know how . He saved us . Show me your arm . Here 's the safety . You shoot and that 's it . - Thanks . No children . - He can serve food or be a messenger . He 's quick . Please , sir . They killed his father . What 's your name ? Gabriel . All right . You can help us in some way . Thank you . Thank you , sir . But no weapons . Thank you . I see fear in your faces dread . No . Today , we must be strong . There will be many soldiers , yes but that won 't stop us Their God PEC will die ! And our God will live forever ! For our freedom ! - Freedom ! The calm of freedom was shattered tonight . Attacks on the dormitories in north Villaparaiso were carried out by rebels who killed at least 60 people and left dozens wounded . Many of the victims were sleeping when the rebels broke into the dorms and forcibly attempted to remove their identity chips . The regime 's forces prevented rebels from killing hundreds of people . After a battle , our agents restored calm . Remember , REGPEC protects you . Villaparaiso , your safe city . General , what 's going on ? Fifteen of my deposit machines were attacked ! They 're boycotting two of my wind energy generation units . Two of my communication antennas were destroyed ! This is affecting our performance . Why do you think Stam is not here ? - Because of work-related matters . Yeah , right . And remove all those bums , General . We 've had enough . We 're making no more concessions to the rebels . We 've set up a pre-military regime in the last 24 hours . And we 'll continue on this path ... Even if abroad they call us bloodthirsty . REMOTE REPROGRAMING It 's done ! Sending changes . Now ! ... TECPANOL acts directly on neuronal synapses by releasing endorphins . - I understand . But for you , I have planned something better . That General is frankly getting on our nerves . Okay . Tell me what to do . - I want you to start getting ready . To learn things they don 't teach in school or in the financial world . Strategies to control all this . OK . Don 't move . Do you know what " teamwork " means ? In this regime , you take the biggest and juiciest share of the pie ! But some of you aren 't doing your job well . You have a great responsibility ! What 's up ? I 'm coming . Think about it , gentlemen ! ... that 's the competitive advantage of TECPANOL . Our products are very powerful . The General would be a nobody without them . There 's something weird here . Look at screen 2 , there are no guards . And here , there 's no one . See why I didn 't go to the meeting ! Soldiers to the plant ! Everyone to the plant ! Tell us ! Who 's in charge of this operation ? We 'll never think like you . We 'd rather be soaked in blood and wait for death . Oh yeah ? Yes . - Really ? Bastard ! Go ! They 're attacking the dormitories in Calista on the west side . Have you gotten anything out of him ? Nothing , General . He doesn 't want to talk . You don 't want to talk ? Show some respect ! Easy ! I 'm not going to hit you . I 'm not like them . I already have all the information . Drop the gun , priest ! Soldier , kill her at the count of three . One ... Two ... Well , this damage is going to cost me , but I got you a little trophy . Leave him alone ! Nice to meet you . General ! We found Pablo Pablo ? Yes , we 've got his position . Pablo de la Lama , your # protégé ! To think of all you must have confided to him . It 's him , sir . When I come back , I want the locations of all your followers . Maybe I should be laughing . The same day as the security meeting ! Don 't make me look for alternatives in England or Israel ! By orders of the General , step aside . Father ! Pablo , the keys ! Pablo ! Go with Goros ! Go to the library ! There in the desk , is my diary and maps of the camps in the mountains . Go now ! - No ! Go now ! - I 'm not leaving you , Miguel . You 've got a more important mission . Follow me . This truck will get us out tomorrow morning . But they 're chasing us ! - This is the only way out of here . Get down ! Don 't shoot ! For all the ones you 've killed . Give me that ! You can 't kill me . No ! Lucia ! Navarro ! Take him away . Pablo , I 'm on your side . Let 's go ! Pablo , do something ! Get down . - What is this ? ! Get down ! The so-called Father Miguel the most-wanted terrorist who had infiltrated Pharmax Industries killed hundreds of workers and Father Miguel , ... was responsible for the electrical system breakdowns in several areas of the city . Run ! To the back ! Quick ! - To the back ! Let 's go ! Go , run ! Run ! Through the back ! Go ! Go ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! To the back ! Hey ! Stop ! No ! Master . Come here . I want to congratulate you . Good job . You killed Miguel ? Yes , Master . And Goros ? Damn ! But if you don 't have Goros , then you haven 't finished anything ! I want Pablo . Now , go ! Go ! What do we do now ? Into the mountains . We 'll regroup there . Come on , son . Come on . Soon , we 'll have to come back .

 Previously on Heroes : We find people and make sure they don 't become dangerous . And you yourself wanted to put a bullet in the brain of a man named Sylar . He 's no longer a threat . He 's dead . They finally took the bait . They caught up with me in Cairo . - I 'm in . - Find out what you can . I 'll find the other paintings myself . I was only given the first . There 's seven more . What 's in the other paintings ? I don 't know . No way . You might want this , Peter . This here is everything you had on you when we found you . It 's all yours . You just have to help us with one little job . Just tell me what I need to do to get my life back . You mean this ? The box with your identity in it ? Sure . It 's all yours . As long as you do us one favour , yeah ? See , Celtic is taking on AC Milan . We 're talkin ' football , yeah ? Soccer . I lost my memory . I 'm not an idiot . The local sports book will be full of cash . After the match , all that money gets put in a lockbox and taken to an armoured car . So you 're gonna rob an armoured car . All we ask is get rid of the guards before they call for help . Simple , really . So if I get you your box , you 'll give me mine . Everyone wins . Not everybody , Sideshow . That cash is mine . Even if I have to kill you for it . What did you say ? I ... I didn 't say a word . You said you were gonna take the cash . - Are you accusing me of something ? - I heard what you said . He said it . You see that ? That 's the family crest . These lads are me brothers . And I trust ' em a hell of a lot more than I trust you . Why would I lie ? I know Will . I don 't know you . You don 't even know yourself . I know . I 'm sorry . - I don 't want to leave Las Vegas . - If there was any other way , Micah ... We 're a family . We 're supposed to stay together . This is our chance at a fresh start . - Without Dad ? - Hey . I promise , whenever you want to see your father , I will make sure that happens . It 's time for us to say good-bye . Hey . No , he 's still sleeping . What can I say ? The guy 's tired . You ... He 's waking up . I 'll have to call you later . Yeah . Good morning , sleepyhead . You wanna go for a dip ? Where am I ? We 're in Maui . Nice , huh ? Feel those trade winds . Who are you ? I 'm Michelle . I used to go by Candice , but ever since I pulled you off of Kirby Plaza the police have been looking for my old self . I 'm going for a new look . What do you think ? You dragged me off Kirby Plaza ? After you got stabbed through the chest with a samurai sword . Eight surgeries later and here we are . Which reminds me , don 't try to move or you 'll rip your stitches . Daiquiri ? Stitches ? - There 's nothing there . - I covered ' em up . I make illusions . It 's kinda my thing . So none of this is real ? Show me what 's really going on here . Honey , you really don 't want to know . Show me . Ah ! Aah ! Hey . Your mom made waffles . Uh , OK . I 'll be down in a minute . You were right to be angry . You tried to talk to me , and I lost my temper . I 'm sorry . No , it 's fine . I shouldn 't have ambushed you with all those questions . Of course you should , Claire . I 've asked you to carry around a heck of a secret . And I think sometimes I don 't appreciate how difficult that must be . So if you have anything you want to ask me , as long as we 're in the privacy of our own home , please , ask away . If someone here found out about me , what would happen ? We 'd have to leave California immediately . Go deeper into hiding . Maybe forgo schools and jobs altogether . That 's worst-case scenario . - It was a pedicure . - I 'm sorry . That 's what I was doing . I was giving myself a pedicure . You 're not very good at it . What is with you creeping around my house ? Tryin ' to lend you a book . If I want to start a book club , I 'll let you know . Stay away from me . I didn 't see you cut off your toe ? The bottle of nail polish fell over . It looked like it was bleeding . - Improvising is really not your forte . - Why are you such a smart-ass ? - Why are you so bad at lying ? - I 'm not . You gave yourself a pedicure . Your toe came off , then came back on . Works for me . - I 'm going to class . - Don 't do your nails on the way . Freeze ! - Oh , for God 's sake . - Mohinder . - You 'll wake Molly . - I thought you were in Cairo . Haiti . My plane got in a couple hours ago . - I 'll be working here . - I thought you were in the field . They 're setting me up downtown . I 'll be around to help with Molly . You 'll be doing your spy work in our own back yard . Great . Someone 's grouchy . Molly 's struggling . Nightmares , problems at school . Can 't baby-sit her and you . - Why would I need babysitting ? - You 're in over your head . - Thank you , but ... - They abducted me . Kept me prisoner . You think you can beat them at their own game . Mohinder , you 're a professor . You 're not 007 . Told myself I would do whatever it took to take down the company . - That 's how I help Molly . - Want to help Molly ? Don 't die . Mohinder , you 're home ! That 's right . And I 'm never leaving again . What in heaven ? All this blood and no wound . You have a power ! An amazing power ! - What have you done to me ? - This is how you become a hero ! This is impossible . This must be some sort of trick . No . Look . Ah ! Lazarus risen . You 've cursed me . No . This is not a curse . It 's a gift . This gift will help you through the trials . To help find the Fire Scroll , 90 Angry Ronins , help rescue Yaeko 's father . Get away from me ! You 're a devil . No , no . I 'm here to help you . Kensei , wait ! We have to write history ! Lightning . Lightning ! Sparks ! Lightning ! So you just yell it out . I 'm just trying to understand how it works . That makes two of us . So far , I got nothin ' . It 's a shame you can 't order lightning up like a plate of chips . Sure would come in handy tonight . God , you know , I can do all these things . It 's just ... I feel powerless . It 's tough not knowing who you are . Yeah , looks like I might just die before I ever figure it out . Maybe you 're an extraterrestrial , escaped from a government facility . I have to admit , I 'm pretty excited to see you open that box . Don 't worry about tonight . I 'll be there to watch your back . How do I know I can trust you ? I haven 't told anyone about what you can do , have I ? Why is that ? Girl 's gotta have her secrets . Dude , you look like ass . No English . All right . Today , we are talking about mitosis . Yes , West . I have a question about regeneration in lizards . You said humans couldn 't regenerate . But what if a lizard were to mate with a human ? Could their offspring do it ? I think I met a lizard girl . This doesn 't strike me as a productive conversation , West . But seriously , what if that lizard girl were to accidentally cut off her arm , or a leg , or you name the appendage , in some kind of horrifying spa debacle ? Where are you going with this ? Would said appendage reattach itself back onto her lizard body ? I cut myself and the wound heals over and over again . You are a hero , like me . - I have powers too . - You ? - Really ? - Yes . I can stop time and move through space . Ah . Hello . How are such things possible ? Oh , some say it 's a gift from God . Some people think it 's evolution . What is that ? Evolution ? It means you can heal from any wound . Really ? Any wound ? Sword ? Serpent ? Fire ? This 'll make me richer than the pope . - Rich ? - Yes ! Swordsman are obsessed with duels . I 'll clean up in wages . You have to defeat Whitebeard and fight the 90 Angry Ronin . If you 're obsessed with my stories so much , you handle them . Kensei , you have to stop walking away from your destiny ! Who 's going to stop me ? Who ? No one is going to stop me because no one can stop me . God . This is extraordinary ! Where have you taken me ? To get the Fire Scroll . It 's on top of those steps . Who are they ? Those are the 90 Angry Ronin , sworn to protect it . How angry are they ? Good luck , Kensei . You can do this . I take it you 're annoyed . What is it , West ? Huh ? What do you want from me ? I want you to admit you 're different . - OK , fine . I 'm a freak . All right ? - Claire . I am such a freak , in fact , I have to tiptoe around this school pretending to be a brainless Barbie doll so nobody notices how different I am . 'Cause if they found out , I 'd be carted off to some human zoo so I could be poked and prodded at for the rest of my life . So yeah , West , I 'm different . And you can tell the world if you want to because I am tired of pretending to be someone I 'm not . Claire , shut up . A shocker in extra time . AC Milan one , Celtic nil . Coming up next on the news ... . - Be careful . - You too . Yes , who 's there ? - Safeline . Here for the pickup . - Hey ! I want my money back . - Back away , friend . - I 'm not your friend , OK ? Give me my $ 200 back . Look , Celtic was supposed to be a lock to win , OK ? - Just help a guy out . - That 's not our problem . Actually , it is your problem . Tie him up , Tuko . Mind these two . Stay down ! That 'll be that now . There he is ! Uhh ! Stop ! Go ! Isn 't this Isaac Mendez 's loft ? The painter . It was . Until Sylar killed him . He was murdered ? Every space has some unhappiness in its past . The company recently poured a lot of money into outfitting this laboratory . Everything state of the art . Well , lucky timing for me then . Mohinder , it was built for you . I 'm sorry . You don 't realise how valued you are here at the company . Our people have been instructed to keep a close watch on you . To anticipate your every need . That is very generous of you . But really , I prefer to work on my own . Supervision is in your best interest and in ours . You 're part of the family now . The scroll ! Things 'll be better now . You 'll see . But you have to remember your promise . No more powers . I don 't see the point of us having these abilities when we don 't even use them . The point is staying safe . This is your chance at a normal life with normal people . They wouldn 't understand . I just don 't want you to go . I 'll only be gone for awhile . And you 're gonna be staying with family . It could be fun . I don 't even know them . I don 't know how long I 'll be gone . But I do know that when I get back , we 'll be together . I have to do this . That 's what you always say before you do something bad . I love you . Well , welcome to New Orleans . Uhh ! Ahh ! No ! Uhh ! Uhh ... What is that ? W-Wait . Take me with you . I have a car . Oh , jeez . Look at that . Gorgeous . - I 'd say we earned these . - Damn right . Hey , drink up . Slainte . All right , Will the traitor . - Please don 't shoot . - This is no joke . Now give me that damn money or I swear I 'll shoot yous dead . So I was right . Yeah . That you were . Congratulations , Peter . Peter ! Hold your horses , sweetheart ! Now , about that money . - No way . - Give me the damn money ! Peter . What the ? What the jeez ... What 's he doin ' ? Peter ! Uhh ! Oof ! - Hiro . - I was worried you wouldn 't return . But you did . You brought back the scroll . Now I know that you will get the rest of them up to Whitebeard 's camp . And even Yaeko loves you . I can leave now . Wait . Wait . You 're going ? Yes , I have another life to go to . My father , Ando ... They 're all waiting for me . But what if I can 't do this without you ? Only you can keep me from returning to my heathen ways . You 're like a conscience . Only I take heed of you . I almost broke history by coming back here . If I stay , I risk making it worse . I don 't know what to say , Carp . You 've done this grubby soul a great kindness . I thank you . - It has been my honour . - No . No , it is I who am honoured to meet the great Takezo Kensei . My friend . Kensei ! Kensei ! I made you some breakfast . I can 't make it move . That cup . I used to be able to make things move with my mind . Thanks for making breakfast , Michelle . You 're a real sport . I can 't freeze anything , move things . What happened to them ? Uh , they must 've disappeared with your injuries . You said you were taking care of me ? Sorry . Are you breathing ? No collapsed lung ? No infection from the wound ? Everything that I 've been working for , everything that I had , it 's gone . The people I work for , they 're gonna make sure you get better . Your back 's already healed . It 's your chest we 're worried about . And when that heals , you 'll be able to reacquire your powers . With my help , of course . You . How are you gonna help ? You gonna make me some more eggs ? By making it easy . By making it fun . I can take you anywhere you want to go . Paris . London . How about Japan ? And I can be anyone you want me to be . If your fantasy is exotic . Or more run-of-the-mill . Or something more familiar , if that 's what you 're into . Don 't you see ? I can help you . We were meant to do this together . I underestimated you . You really are extraordinary . Just like me . You were right . I am gonna get my abilities back . Starting with yours . So this is what you really look like . So silly trying to be something that you 're not . Well , Michelle or Candice or whoever you are , it wasn 't all for nothing . Thanks to you I 'll be going back to Maui now . London . Japan . Japan ! Ah ! It 's not working . I don 't have it . Your power . What 's wrong with me ? Ahh ! Ah , would you quit being such a baby , pretty boy ? Peter . I may not know what you are , but I know who you are . You 're one of us . And we have no secrets among family . - Well ? - Well what ? This is it . Your box . Your life . You gonna open it or what ? What if it 's a life I don 't want ? When I had Will against the wall , I could 've killed him . I wanted to . What if that 's who I am ? - But you didn 't kill him , did you ? - No , that 's because of you . It 's not because of me , Peter . You 're a good soul . I can tell . What if I open this box and I find otherwise ? Do you like where you are right now ? Do you like who you are right now ? Well , then maybe for now just leave it be . I think yours is cooler . Any time your parents get annoying , you can just open the window and take off . Are you kidding ? You 're indestructible . - You can skydive without a parachute . - You could skydive without a plane . Uh , you can eat fire just for kicks . I feel pain . I just get over it quickly . So how would it feel then if I ... if I do this ? Ow ! It hurts ! - What about this then ? - Ah ! What 's on your neck ? A couple years ago , when we were living in St Louis , I was riding my bike to school , and next thing I knew it was a day later and I was waking up in my bed . Last thing I remember is this man stepping out of the bushes calling my name . What are you talking about ? What man ? I don 't know who he was . But I remember the way he looked at me . Like I was an animal he wanted to trap . I try to put him out of my head , but sometimes I see his face . That guy with the horn-rimmed glasses . - I have another vial . - I 'll get started on it right away . Yeah ? I have to take this outside . Where are you ? I just got here . I 'm sitting in youroffice . Are you sure you 're gonna be able to cure me ? Yes . And like I said , in exchange , we 're going to want a little something from you . They 're moving the paintings somewhere . There 's only a few crates left . This was a terrible idea . This guy 's watching my every move . I can 't do this . I 'm in over my head . I told you you have no reason to worry . As long as I 'm alive , you will be taken care of . - That 's exactly the problem . - What are you talking about ? I 'm sending you a JPEG of a painting I found . The rest have been shipped off . It 's the last in the series . 8 of 8 . We know how it begins with the death of Kaito Nakamura . - But how does it end ? - Not well , I 'm afraid . Night , Claire . Night , Dad .

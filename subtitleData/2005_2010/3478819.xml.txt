 All right . We are transmitting right now . We do have a signal . A Pentagon ... A Pentagon official ... A Pentagon official , reached by telephone has just confirmed that U.S. Missiles have destroyed an asteroid that entered the Earth 's atmosphere . The tail end ... to hit our planet in recorded history - to hit our planet in recorded history . Let 's go . Meteor impacts have caused destruction worldwide . We 've been unable to reestablish communication with anyone outside of North America since our satellite feed went down . So all we 're able to bring you are these images from last night ... last night . I apologize . We are experiencing technical difficulties . Here in the U.S. , casualty ... Here in the U.S. , casualty counts are still being compiled , but the estimates we 've been able to piece together are rapidly climbing to a staggering 22,000 . Property damages being estimated in the hundreds of billions , and environmental impact is truly catastrophic . An hour ago the president addressed the nation via shortwave radio , which is quickly becoming the only reliable mode of communication . We ask that you stay where you are . Or if where you are isn 't safe , please proceed to the closest shelter or FEMA camp . Now that the meteor storm and debris fallout has stopped , we 've begun using aircraft to deliver aid nationwide . Try to remember , as dark as this day may seem , we have neutralized an asteroid that could have wiped us out of existence . We have lived to fight another day . We have prevailed . Calvin . Calvin , please . All right , all right , partner . Just for old times ' sake , I 'm gonna be real nice about this . And make it fast . No ! Ladies and gentlemen , it 's over there have been no reported impacts in the last three hours . Now I 'm not one for speeches , but on behalf of the president and a very grateful nation , I want to thank each and every one of you for a job well done . We have accomplished our mission . We stopped the meteors . Now it 's up to other teams to clean up the mess . Now , I know we all want to get to our families . The skies are clear . We 've got choppers on standby . Let 's go home . Michael ! Chelsea ! Michael . Murphy . Ah . Murphy . - No . - Don 't try to talk . You gotta go . Go warn them . Go . Oh , no . No , you 're not getting off that easy . I have a granddaughter . When she grows up , I want her to be like you . No . Channel one ? Our signal 's too weak . Oh , man . Got some more blankets here , folks , if anybody didn 't get one Lester , turn it down a little bit , will you ? You 're scaring people . All right , listen up , folks . Listen up , please . I 've got some good news , and I 've got some bad news . The good news is that we haven 't seen or heard anything fall out of the sky for the last couple of hours , and the radio seems to be giving us an all-clear . The bad news is ... I ' m afraid you 're gonna have to stay here for a little while longer until we go out and check and make sure everything is safe . So give us your patience for just a little while longer , and we 'll get you home just as soon as we can . Nothing . The satellites are probably damaged . Can 't we just leave him here ? Tie him to a pipe or something ? I don 't trust him . He 's too smart . Come on . Are you okay ? Oh . I 'm feeling a little tender . You ? Yeah . I wish mom was here . I do too . Uh , Trent , are you okay ? It 's my leg . Uh , okay . Come on , I got ya . I got ya . Oh , jeez , sorry . Careful . Right . Buck , come on . Buck , wake up . Buck . Michael ! Michael ? Come on , kiddo . Please answer . Oh , god , he 's not breathing . What do we do ? I don 't know . Help ! Help ! Michael , can you hear me ? Mom , I 'm here . Oh , baby , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine , but buck 's not . He 's passed out . He 's not breathing . I need you to go to buck and do exactly what I say . Okay . Okay , I 'm here . Is he laying on his back ? Yeah . Now I need you to breathe for him . Ma , I can 't do this . I don 't know how . You can do this , Michael . His life depends on it ! Outstanding , sir . Oh , it 's gonna be okay . Sir ! We 've got incoming . What ? They 're reading off the charts . What the hell ? We got the level five counter ! They 're not fallout . They 're too big . Then what are they ? I don 't know . It could be another wave . I don 't know where it 's coming from . I got no data here . And where the hell 's our warning ? We got no satellite coverage . And ground radar 's still only 30 % operational . Get everyone back . How far out is Colonel Beck ? We can 't raise his chopper , sir . My god . General , get everything in the air down now . You heard the man . And let 's get all missile batteries back on alert . And pray that we have enough left . One , two , three , four . No way , man . No way . What is it ? He 's okay . Michael , answer me ! Michael , please ! He 's okay , mom ! Buck 's okay ! Oh , thank God . Oh , thank you , god . Folks , I know that some of your homes have been damaged , but just remember , the Fallout Shelter is open for business . We 're here to help you if you need us . It 's horrible . Yeah , it could be worse . At least we 're alive . Hi . Hello . Do you have a phone ? A landline ? Great . And it works ? Yup . Oh , thank god . $ 50 . Excuse me ? $ 50 for the phone . That 's ridiculous . Look , I 'm a scientist . There 's another asteroid coming . This is an emergency . I need to talk to the government . Fine , we 're all gonna die , but apparently , all you care about is your stupid money . I just came across the border , okay ? I have pesos and , like , $ 16 . Come on . $ 16 for one stupid phone call ? This is an emergency . I need to use the goddamn phone now . Drop it ! Drop it now . Please . Now go . Please ... Please don 't shoot . Even though the meteors have stopped falling , many fear this is just the first chapter in a worldwide catastrophe from which we may never recover . The estimated cost of rebuilding damaged and destroyed structures is projected to continue to rise for the foreseeable future . Many analysts are predicting a figure in the hundreds of trillions of dollars . Leading experts at the IMF have gone on record as saying that it will take a concerted effort by countries around the globe to address the truly biblical scale of the devastation . Max Pearl , assistant secretary of the treasury , testifying at the first congressional hearings ... Said that he believes the economies of the world will unilaterally become what he described ... I thought they 'd stopped . Economies of necessity , where rebuilding infrastructure and providing basic needs will become paramount for decades . Kitty Corcoran , NPR News , Los Angeles . Let go ! Let go ! Russ ? You 're lucky I decided to make another run for survivors . Why aren 't you at the shelter ? I think Chelsea ... Chelsea and Michael are inside . This whole place could cave in at any moment . I know . Which is why I gotta get ' em out . Wait . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Come on . This is a big place . There gotta be another way in . Where ? There 's a service entrance behind the south wing lot . We could try there . Come on . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Jenny . Jenny . Hello , this is Chief Crowe at the Taft Police Department requesting assistance . Anybody out there ? Highway patrol , come in . Still nothing . Maybe the relay station in Del Mar got hit . Yeah , maybe . Um , Chief ? What is it , son ? What 's the matter ? How long do you think we 're gonna be able to hold out ? This is ... this is a catastrophe . We 're gonna need help . And we 're gonna get it . Son , we just keep going . We take it one hour at a time . The important thing is to stay cool . Now , you hang in there . You 're doing just fine . Whew . Okay . Thank you , sir . Hello . This is Chief Crowe at the Taft Police Department . Come in . Come in . General , it 's confirmed . Colonel Beck 's chopper went down . No survivors . Sir ! Go . I have a rock heading just south of Taft , California . Isn 't that mostly desert ? Sir , there 's the Taft power plant . So ? Most of the pacific grid is already out . That 's a nuclear power station . What are the chances ? I don 't know . I 've never heard of a nuclear power station taking a direct hit from a meteor . Mom . What , honey ? Look . Any station this net . This is CHO station seven . Radio check , over . Come in , station seven . Chief , a meteor just hit the power station . Damn it ... Let 's get everybody back to the shelter right now . Mom ? Mom ! Hey , uh , something 's happening . Mom ! What ... what happened ? Buck , he 's not breathing right . Okay , is he bleeding ? Is blood coming out of his mouth ? No . Okay . All right , that 's good . Um ... Mom , what do we do ? It 's getting worse . Oxygen . He needs oxygen . What do I do ? You need to calm him down . Get him to calm down his breathing . That 's very important . How do I calm it ? Um ... Mom ! Mom ! Michael , uh , honey , I need you to look around . Do you see a closet ? In fact , there should be an exit to a closet in the back . Is that blocked ? Yeah , I think I can get in there . Why ? Okay , um , good , you 're gonna - there 's a hallway that leads down to stairs that go down to the first floor . That 's where they keep the oxygen tank . Okay , I 'm going . And , oh , once you get down there , you 're gonna make a sharp left and then a right . And then you 'll see the storage room . Okay , and please be careful . I will . Listen , you need to stay here and keep him calm while I get oxygen , all right ? How ? I don 't know . I can 't do this . No , you have to ! Okay , just hurry . Russ , Russ , come on . Come on . Breathe into it . Breathe into it . Stand up . Whoa , whoa come on . You gotta rest . All right , we 'll figure this out . Christ ! You know what ? This I can solve . Chelsea ! Michael ! Chelsea ! Come on ! Lieutenant , have you heard anything about Imogene O 'Neill yet ? Nothing yet . I 'm sorry , sir . I really could use her . Hey ! Hey , hey , wait ! Wait ! Can I get a ride ? Look at us . Maybe we deserve it . Want some ? Why are you doing this ? I thought maybe you were thirsty . I know what you mean . Your father destroys my life . And now it 's his turn to suffer . Is that what you mean ? Just let me go . There 's ... there 's nothing ... Come on , Jenny . Come on ! Have some fun , huh ? Life is too short , baby . It 's a gorgeous day . We got fireworks in the sky . Oh , god . Please don 't kill me . Killing me will do nothing . Contraire , my sweet love . Killing you is gonna be so , so much fun . And then I 'm gonna do your grandpa , your papa . And then , you know what 's gonna be the best part of all of this , huh ? Watching your daddy 's face see it all happening . You 're good for now . But you know what ? I see that look again , you try to walk away again , I 'm gonna blow out your kneecaps and still make you walk . Understand me ? And that hurts . Please , please . You ever try walking without kneecaps , baby ? Huh ? It 's hard to do . And it hurts . Go ! These prices for real ? Supply and demand . What you need ? I 'll take two of these bottles of water and one of what you 're eating . This oughta cover it . Your math 's not too good . No ? Well , then maybe this will help . I 'm not doing anything illegal . Pop , you all right ? You have a permit for that ? Put the gun down , now . Or what ? Okay , this can end a couple of ways , none of them good . This keeps up , your son will wind up dead or a murderer . It 's your call . Put it down . Now ! Wait outside . Ordinarily , I 'd have to confiscate the gun and take him in . Today 's not really normal , though , is it ? No . But showing him it 's all right to take advantage of people during a crisis , it 's just not a very ... Not a very good example . You follow me ? You should get to a hospital . No , I don 't have time . I have to find my , uh , my daughter . You on foot ? Yeah , I ... totaled my car back down the road . Look , let me help you out . I owe you . Hello ? May I help you ? I 'm sorry . I called out , but nobody answered . Oh , that 's okay . L ... my hearing isn 't as good as it used to be . Uh , would you like a cup of tea ? I just made a pitcher . Yes , please . All right . But can I use your phone , first ? I 'm just in a bit of a hurry . Oh , surely , go right ahead . Make yourself at home . Finn . Yes . Right away . Dr. Chetwyn . Imogene O 'neill on two . Hey , how are you ? Well , I 've been better . Dr. Lehman 's assumptions were off . Wait , wait , I 'm putting you on the box . Lehman 's assumptions what ? Were off . He miscalculated the mass . The first half of Kassandra split the comet in two . And the asteroid we blew up ? Was only half of Kassandra . And the other half is bigger . Now , this shouldn 't be happening , but I still think it 's heading right for us . All right , that explains the meteor activity we 're getting . Wait , are you telling me there 's another asteroid coming ? Yes . Are you sure ? Why didn 't near-earth radar pick that up yesterday ? Because the first half of Kassandra was shadowing the radar . Now look , I 'm running the asymmetrical trajectory algorithm . Sir , I have incoming , and it 's huge . That 's Kassandra . Not as big as Kassandra . I 'd say 900 square feet . Where 's it headed ? Uh , sir ? Is that ? Incoming . Everybody down ! Dr. Chetwyn ? Lieutenant , move ! It 's coming down ! Here we go . Dr. Chetwyn ! Anyone ? Sometimes it acts up . No , I think they 've been hit . Anything ? No . I think we 're all gonna die . Well , I think you 're right . Shouldn 't you be getting to a shelter ? Why ? If I 'm going to die , I 'll do it right here in my home with the things that I love . See , honey , I 've come to terms with who I am and how I 've lived my life . And I 'm surprisingly happy . Here . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry , I 'm ... No . I can 't . I can 't just give up . Not if there 's still a chance . Then you go , girl . Where 's the nearest Army base ? Well , that 's Claremont Naval Station . My Ronnie was ... Okay , okay . So if I could just communicate with Dr. Chetwyn , if he 's not gone . And , um , okay , and if he is , I 'm sure there are some sort of command center by now . Um ... can I borrow your car ? Oh , I 'm sorry , I gave it to charity last year . Damn it . Oh , I 'm sorry . Could you use a gun ? All right . Follow me . Michael ! Move , move , move ! Come on . The president has just declared martial law ... Chief , you think it was nuclear ? I didn 't see a mushroom cloud . Well , there could be radiation . That 's why we need to get inside . All right , let 's go , folks . All the way into the shelter . Water are being distributed at the local level by National Guard and Army Units . City authorities ... I.D. Tags ... Um , I 've just been informed ... Uh , sharp right than a left . Sharp right ... Come on . Think . Think . One , two , now ! What ? Find Imogene . She h-has t-trajectory . Christ . My god . He saved my life . Now who 's gonna save ours ? Turns out we used up most of our missiles on only half an asteroid . The other half 's coming back to finish the job . And even if we had enough firepower left , we 're radar-blind . No . No , we 're not . The space station . Didn 't we just send a team up last week ? You 're assuming they survived last night . But , sir , no one said they didn 't . If they 're still up there , they could be our eyes . How do we communicate ? Satellites aren 't on . Yeah , and shortwave won 't reach . What about the ground base dishes ? We can hook ' em up on a ghost relay , and then ... It won 't work for audio . We don 't need audio . Just bursts . Morse code . Good thinking , soldier . Let 's just hope it works . Now , I know you folks have been through a lot here , what with all the hoo-hah going on out there , and I want you to know I 'm kind of in a hurry . So I need you to just stay calm and relaxed , all right ? Oh . Oh , yeah . This is good . Ah . Look at that . Say cheese . That 's gonna turn out great , baby . There you go . All right . Gonna be out of your here in just one sec . You 're doing great . You 're doing very good . You 're not looking very relaxed , though . Why ? Why not let them live ? You know what ? Never even occurred to me . Here we go . All right , you can do this . Aah ! The associated press is reporting there have been two hits in Siberia . One off the coast of Iceland and one as far south as the Sinai desert . Trent ! Is he back yet ? No ! Reports are widespread of civil unrest ... Looting and violence appear to be growing ... Come on , baby , what are you doin ' ? Stop ! Leave me alone ! Damn ! Whoo ! Come on , baby . Come on ! Oh , yeah , baby . Don 't ! LAPD . On the ground , now ! Now ! Drop the weapon . What 's it to you ? The world 's gonna end . Please don 't shoot me , please . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's all right . I am a cop . I am a cop . Okay ? Come on . Let 's get you somewhere safe . For the record , steam pipes are hot . Hey , hold up . I just thought of something . Water . They 've been without water for hours . Shouldn 't we have brought the water ? Look , the most important thing is to find them and get ' em out of here . Yeah . Let 's go . We gotta move . Hey ! Hey ! No , you don 't understand . Wait ! Damn it ! Damn it . Damn it ! Damn it ! God . Stand by . They 're alive . They 're on the other side of the globe , through the worst of it . Can they track the center ? Yes , they say they 've now got her on visual . She 's that close ? Yeah , they say their biggest problem will be staying out of her way . Huh , and our biggest problem is shooting her down . What good is knowing where she is if we used up all our missiles ? We 've got some left . Chetwyn 's girl said this asteroid is bigger . We 're dead ! Mr. Whitaker , you will either calm down , or I will calm you down . Well said , lieutenant . And here 's a thought . What ? We 're not the only ones with missiles . Get me through to the bunker on shortwave . I need to get the president to start speaking with the Russians and , uh ... The Chinese . And let 's pray they haven 't used up their arsenal . I 'm really sorry , ma 'am , but I told you already , the fresh fruit is for the kids . I think this rationing is ridiculous . Why should the elderly suffer ? Ma 'am , we have limited supplies . Limited supplies . Don 't treat me like an idiot . Look , Mrs. Neely , just choose something else . Oh ! Uhh ! Excuse me . Look , Dwight , stay out of this . We have plenty of fruit . For the kids and Mrs. Neely . God bless you , young man . Thank you . You 're welcome . Here you go , guys . Dwight . I was wrong . Thank you . Okay , folks . Listen up . I checked the FEMA guidelines . The explosion itself was certainly not nuclear . So the chances of radioactive fallout , very small . But they 're there . You 're absolutely right . And that 's why I brought these . What are those ? Geiger counters . You have radiation suits that go with those ? No . No , we don 't . Unfortunately , we didn 't plan the way we should have . This is unacceptable . Which is why I am taking full responsibility . I 'll check the radiation myself . Sure that 's wise , chief ? Comes with the territory . You can 't go alone . He 's right . The more that go with you , the quicker you can cover the town , the less you 'll be exposed to radiation . Count me in . Me too . Me too . Comes with the territory . I was hoping you 'd say that . Step right up , gentlemen . Come on , Lester . I had to kill the two guys . So if you guys are headed back that way , back down the road ... Ma 'am , you want some water ? Here you go . Hey . Hey . Listen , these fellas are gonna take you to the FEMA camp . It 's ... it 's only about a half an hour down the road . They have a full medical team there , and ... Well , I 'm sorry . I wish I could take you myself . But ... I just have to find my daughter , so ... Do you think anyone will care ? About me , I mean ? With all this going on ? Yes . I care . These fellas care . The doctors will care . It may not seem so , but there are still decent people out there . Okay ? Really ? Thank you . Glad I could help . Oh , God . Oh , my God ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Trent ? Trent ! Yeah . Do you hear anything ? Like Michael ? He 's not back yet . I tried calling out earlier . How 's Buck ? He passed out a while ago . Behave yourself . We 're gonna need you to turn around . Sir , you all right ? Oh , I 'm fine , thank you . I 'm LAPD . We 're in pursuit of a suspect we think might have come this way . May I pass ? I 'm sorry , sir . I can 't let you do that . Nuclear power plant got hit with a meteor , and they think there 's gonna be some fallout . I need you to turn back . Oh , wow , that 's crazy . No problem . No problem . Oh , excuse me . Sir ? Do you guys have an extra bottle of water or something ? Yeah , of course , detective . One for the lady . Hold tight . Thank you . Look out ! If you ever try that again , I 'm gonna do things to you that 's gonna make you beg me to kill you . Do you understand ? I can 't trust you anymore . That 's what I 'm talking about . Hey , hey ! Stop ! Damn it ! What is that ? That 's the pipes . Pressure 's changing . Something must be blocking the valves . Aah ! Look , we gotta move . We gotta move . We gotta get outta here ! Look , we gotta get outta here . Whoa , no , no ! That stuff will burn you alive . Look , you go first , okay ? Yeah . One . Two . Ah ! Go ! Go ! Aah ! Move , Russ ! Let 's go , let 's go ! Oh ! Go ! - Get out of the car . - Ho , ho , ho ... wait . - Get outta the car now ! - Okay . All right . You may want to take the safety off that weapon first , though . Please , don 't kill me . This is your lucky day , lady . I am a cop and I don 't even have the time to arrest you . Okay , please . I need to get to the Claremont Navy Base . Please . No , you need to get lost , all right ? I am done . I need to find my daughter . Okay , and I need to get these coordinates to the army to shoot down that asteroid , or we 're all gonna die while I sit here yelling at you . So basically you need a lift . Yes . All right . I 'm going to Taft . It 's an hour away from Claremont . If the government really needs you , they can send someone to pick you up . No , you don 't understand . No , you don 't understand . Do you want to walk ? No . Then get in . Get in ! Idiots ! Sir ? The Chinese are on board , but the God damn Russians refuse to share their arsenal . They 're radar blind . They 've got to protect their people . Blah , blah , blah ... What do the boys upstairs say ? They estimate 20 minutes till she enters the atmosphere , 1 / 2 hour tops . All right , let 's hope our missiles and the Chinese are enough . Let 's get a trajectory from the space station . Sir . Go . You say the Russians are radar blind . Yeah , so are we . So what ? So they don 't know what 's coming their way until it 's about to hit . Your point ? Why don 't we warn them that ground zero for the asteroid hit is Moscow . And how would we know that , soldier ? We don 't , sir . They have to think we do . You mean ... Yes , sir . We tell them Kassandra 's headed their way and they won 't get the exact coordinates until they agree to a coordinated launch . That 's insane . Sir , we are running out of options . That 's so insane it just might work . Man , I 'm freezing . You smell that ? Oh , God . Oh , god . Uhh ! God , no . No . Mom ! Mom ! Help ! To the right . Russ , Russ ! Okay . Whoa , whoa . Ladies first . Damn ! What ? Something must be blocking it from above . Well come on , let me give it a go . No , wait , wait . I got it . Hey , chief . Dwight here . Hey , Dwight . How 's it going ? Looks all clear here . Same here . I 'll do a few more blocks , then let 's head up past oak street . Copy that . Would you look at that ? Your old grandpa didn 't even stop to say hello . And you call that family . You did it , kid . The Russians bought it . They 're not happy about it , but they 'll aim the missiles where we tell them . And that 's good , 'cause the space station says the asteroid 's entering earth 's gravity as we speak . Trajectory vectors ? Should have them at any minute . Luckily , Kassandra 's going to miss them by at least a mile . Good . We lost ' em . What ? No . Nothing . We lost contact . We have to assume the worst . Trent ? Trent ! Michael ! I 'm not dying here today . They 're wasting missiles . Okay , the initial impact was there ... So allowing for a trajectory differentiation and atmospherics ... How long till your asteroid hits ? About a half hour , if we 're lucky . You 're not making this up , are you ? It 's all right here . We 're gonna die , unless we stop this . I 'm sorry about your daughter . I will find her if it 's the last thing I do . Which , according to you , it may well be . This is insane . It 's just ... I know . Well , I don 't care if it is all ending . You want to be with her . I know . You 're a good father . No , i am a poor excuse for a father . Look , my dad went out for cigarettes when I was 12 and never came back . So wherever he is , I can guarantee he 's not thinking about me . Trust me . You 're a good father . Thanks . Dad ! Michael ! Thank God ! I 'm stuck . Yeah . Hang on , try not to move . Dad , we need to get mom . And oxygen for Buck . We gotta get you out of here first . Come on , come on ! Does it hurt anywhere ? What the hell ? I grew up here . I 'm sorry . Let 's get you a phone before ... before this gets any worse . I hope I can still reach JPL . My father 's office is just down at the end of the , uh ... Run ! Come on , Jackie boy ! Gonna get you , baby ! And your little friend too ! Dr. Hapscomb ? Yeah . Which way did Michael go ? Uh , there . Okay . I 'm gonna get you guys outta here . That 's okay . That 's it . You 're okay . All right , can you help me with that wheelchair over there ? Yeah . All right , we 're gonna take you outta here . You 're gonna be okay . What the hell ? He has my daughter . This way ! Coming for you , Jackie ! Whoo ! Dance , Jackie , dance ! I 'm coming to get you ! Dad . Jack . Dad , we 're not alone . That 's right . You 're not . Is that you , Calvin ? Yep . Play time 's over , jack . Slide your gun out to me . Now ! What 's going on , Calvin ? Uh-uh-uh . Don 't do that , chief . Dad , he has Jenny . Where is she , Calvin ? I won 't ask again . You 're in no position to ask anything . Now ... I think it 's time for you to say good-bye to your daddy . Good-bye , Calvin . Good shot , son . You got him . Come on . You haven 't lost your touch , son . Dad , this is Imogene . She needs the phone right away . I think the phones are out all over town . Where do you think he stashed Jenny ? I don 't know , but I 'll find her . What about the radio tower on the Hangman 's Hill ? Is it a microwave transmitter ? I don 't know . I think so . But don 't you think we ought to find my granddaughter first ? I will find Jenny , all right ? You get Imogene up the hill . We 'll meet you there . All right . Jenny . Jenny . Baby . Daddy ! I knew you 'd make it . Is he dead ? Yes , he 's dead . It 's over . Honey , I 'm so sorry about all this . It 's not your fault . Yes . Yes , it is . You 're a cop . That 's what you do . You do the right thing even if it hurts . I get it . Is grandpa okay ? Yeah . All right , we have to get out of here , all right ? Hello ? Hello ? Russ ! Oh , my God ! Chelsea Oh , my God ! Russ , Michael , my baby ! Good God ! Oh , sweetheart ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . Are you all right ? I 'm okay . Oh , my God . Hey , Buck 's ... Buck 's kind of passed out . Oh , right . All right , out . Out ... everybody out now . Move , move ! I got ' em , I got ' em , I got ' em . Give ' em oxygen outside . Come on . Here , rest here . Ugh . I 'm never calling this air polluted again . Mom , look . We gotta get away from the building . One more percussion 's gonna bring it down . Let 's go , come on . Is there anything I can do ? No , I 'm almost there . I just gotta boost the cell signal . San Diego and L.A. Both have visuals . Oh , God . And now Seattle . That 's three . Start triangulating . Descent vectors ? Coming through . Forgot to shut the windows . Brasser . It 's Imogene . Are you tracking Kassandra ? We 're about to launch . We have her on visual . No , she 's past the event horizon . The fall-out ... Will probably kill a lot of us . I 'm sorry , Ms. O 'Neill . What is it ? It 's too late . We 're all gonna die . Ms. O 'Neill , we 're launching . How much firepower do you have ? Well , hopefully enough . China and Russia are launching with us . Okay , I need your real-time descent vector . What 's the point ? Just give it to me , okay ? I have an idea . 1 ... 1-0-5 , 18 at 30 degrees to the ecliptic . Okay , okay . Uh ... Hello ? Hello ? Hello , Ms. O 'Neill ? Hello , Ms. O 'Neill ? Sir , we really should launch . Start the launch sequence . Yes , sir . What 's wrong ? The lights shouldn 't be off . We gotta get them back . I think the power 's plugged in . Um ... The generator . Gonna need a fuse for that . I thought this would come in handy . No ! Funny it should end this way , huh ? Yeah , funny . Okay , assume velocity is at least ... He 's gonna be okay . You did it , man . You did it . You okay ? Yeah . I thought I told you to stay in the car . Yeah . I never listen , do I ? Well , I ... I 'm fine . Thanks . Don 't worry about me . Grandpa , are you okay ? You think this thing is radioactive ? Oh ! I still need power . Six . Five . Four . Three . Two . One . Launch . Repeat . Launch . Weapons are red and free ... go . Mom , are we gonna die ? No . Look , whatever happens , we 're all together . 90 seconds till impact . It 's been an honor to serve with you . All of you . Brasser . I 'm sorry . We 've launched . How long till impact ? Just over a minute . You can reprogram on the go . Put me on the box . New coordinates . What 's the point ? Because I ... I figured it out . No fall-out . Impossible . Okay , well I can explain it to you , or we could save the planet , okay ? So it 's your choice . Go , new coordinates , reset on the fly . Okay , new target . 5-0-2 . 46 , 18 degrees . Two seconds below midpoint . Got it . New coordinates . 5-0-2 , 46 , 18 degrees . Two seconds below midpoint . Okay , now set all missiles to self-destruct on impact . That 's ridiculous . General , do you want to die today ? Sir , the woman 's a genius . 40 seconds to impact . Do it . Set all missiles to detonate on impact . Five seconds to impact . Four . Three . Two . One . Please . Please . Birds are blown . Detonation complete . Fall-out ? We ... What ? We ... we missed , sir . All ground units report still seeing the asteroid . Lieutenant , you said she was a genius ! Why did I listen to that girl ? Because we 're still alive , sir . What 's happening ? I don 't know . All I know is that we 're still alive . I think it 's getting smaller . She wasn 't trying to hit the asteroid . Imogene gave us coordinates to deflect her . The missile explosion acted as a shield , a bumper . And it worked ? All stations report the asteroid changed trajectory . It 's heading out of the atmosphere . Oh ! General , did it work ? Oh , my God . What 's wrong ? I think they 're dying . You did it ! Imogene , you did it ! They sound pretty happy for dead people . Excuse me . Mm , wow . Oh , my goodness . That is beautiful . I just ... I want ... I want to say something . I 'd like to propose a toast , first of all , to our gracious host for providing us with this wonderful meal . Oh , it 's the least we could do . And I would also like to say a special thanks to you , Imogene , for your courage . Without you , none of us would be here . Thank you . Cheers . Thank you . Please excuse me . Excuse me . Hey . Hey . You okay ? Yeah . I mean , it 's still so raw . You know it 'll take time , but ... things will get back to normal . Until next time . And what do you mean " Next Time " ? They say there will be another close call 18 years from now , around 2027 . How close ? An asteroid named A-N-1999 . They think it 's gonna pass within about 200,000 miles of earth . Well , that doesn 't ... that doesn 't seem so close . Unless we 're one degree off or if something knocks her off her course .

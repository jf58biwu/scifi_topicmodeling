 Mmm . Hello , Governor . Really ? Is he on now ? There are people who are frankly stunned by your seemingly meteoric rise . In the senate less than three months and already closely allied with the president on what many people are calling unprecedented access to the average American 's most private details . Steve , I 'm just a humble junior senator from New York , but as chairman of the senate commission on homeland security , it 's my duty to protect and serve the people of America . I can assure you , Governor , I don 't know any more about this than you do . Trust me , that 's ancient history . I haven 't spoken to him in close to two months . Now , if you don 't mind , I do have to get some sleep . The rumors in Washington are of frequent private meetings at the White House , and the question on everyone 's mind is : What are you discussing ? Well , again , these are matters of national security . We 're protecting the American people from a very serious threat . Are we talking about terrorism ? Let me assure you , the threat is real . We 're not out to alarm the American public , but it 's important that we take precautionary measures . Senator , I don 't mean to belabor this . Of course the questions remain : Why you ? Why now ? Well , I 'd love to go into specifics with you , Steve , but these are highly classified discussions . There are those that fear that what you 're really talking about is taking away civil liberties , relaxing FISA policies , expanding the reach of the patriot act . What about that ? Anyone who knows my record and my career will tell you I 've devoted my life to protecting people . As a district attorney in New York , I was tough on crime . ... and I can assure you ... What sort of precautions ... ... as you put it earlier , the normal job ... You want me to beg ? And now I 'm continuing that passion with the protection of the entire nation . Well , screw you . Is this about your religious calling ? I don 't beg for anyone . After your assassination attempt , you made claims that god has a mission for you . What do you want ? Yes , I stand by those comments . Now more than ever . Cover her hands . - You got her ? - Got her . All right . All right , we 're good . I 'm a god-fearing man . I just want what 's best for our country . Tell Petrelli , we got the first one . subtitle by team ydy. com edited and synced by rogard Tokyo , Japan Chapter One " A Clear and Present Danger " Open your eyes . Used to be a firehouse . I pulled some strings , bought it from the city . Now it 's our lair . Lair ? We 've been over this , Hiro ... You 're going to look very bad ass in the rest of your costume . See ? Perfect ! Is this Spandex ? I wouldn 't be caught dead in this thing . A superhero must hide his true identity . I know what this is about , Hiro . You do ? You have no powers anymore , so you want to live through me . No ! But my power is worthless . You 're a super charger ! For other people 's power ! Children will speak of your crime fighting skills for generations . Right after they stop laughing at the way I 'm dressed . Ando ... It is your destiny to become a superhero . Forget it . I 'm not interested . We 'll see if you feel that way after you see the Ando-cycle . There 's an Ando-cycle ? It 's a motorcycle . Not just any motorcycle . Go ahead . I 've embedded the latest two-way communication ... all from right here at base camp . You just enter the password . Let me guess , I don 't get to know the password . No . Not even a clue ? It 's the name of someone ... very important to me . Once I 've entered the password , I can track your location ... anywhere on the planet with your GPS implant . What GPS implant ? This one . I can 't believe you did that to me ! Don 't worry . I did the same thing to myself . Only hurts for an hour or so . You 're insane ! I 've had it with you ! Get yourself another superhero ! Breathe in . Breathe in . Breathe in . Breathe in . Breathe ... Peter , it 's over . No , I can save him . It 's no use . He 's dead . Damn it . I could have saved him . No , you couldn 't . He bled out in the car . I should have got to him faster . He was pinned in there . So I should have been stronger . You can 't save everyone . I should have been stronger . Well , any favorites yet ? Yeah , I mean , Hamilton , Smith , Georgetown , they 're all ... the best schools in the country . Getting your GED was the best thing you could have done . An elite education is something most people only dream about . Claire , you 're an exceptional young woman , and you deserve an exceptional education . If you say so . Are you okay ? Look , I appreciate this . You putting me up and offering to get me into school , but I don 't think I can do this . Your father and I have discussed this at length . Which one ? Both of them . And we all felt that going to college was the best chance that you would have at a normal life . Everyone keeps saying that , but none of us have a chance at a normal life when he 's still out there . When who 's still out there ? Sylar . Claire , Sylar is dead . We stood there together and watched Primatech burn to the ground . They found dental remains . I know he 's out there , okay ? I can feel it in my gut . He 's killing again , and my father is trying to hide it from me . I found an article in his desk about a man who went missing in Memphis . They searched his house and found his entire upstairs filled with salt water . I 'm sure there 's some explanation . My dad keeps going away for days at a time going on business trips . It 's happening again , and I should be out there helping to stop it . Claire , you have got to believe me . It 's over . All of it . Primatech , the company , Pinehearst . All of it . And we all have to accept that . No . You 're just trying to put me on the bench . He 's out there . And if I 'm the only one who sees that , then fine . I 'll go find him myself . You move , and I shoot . God damn thief . Think you can come into my shop without me hearing you ? Martin ? Martin Gray ? Do I know you ? Did you live at 423 Canmore Street in Queens 27 years ago ? It was snowing . In the middle of February , you went out for a pack of cigarettes at 10 o 'clock and never came back . Or so the story goes . Kind of clich√© , don 't you think ? Who are you ? I 'm your son . And I have some questions for you . Oh , hey . I was just- - Working ? Yeah . I got done with all my morning deliveries , so I thought I 'd just come home . At 10 : 30 ? Are you spying on me ? Maybe . Look , I know I said I wouldn 't use my speed , but do you have any idea how long it takes to get across midtown on a bike ? Yes , and that 's sort of the idea . But I 'm all done for the day . We could go to the zoo or something . Some of us still have to put in a full day . You know , I could use my ability to work my way clear to the top of the police force , but do I ? No , ' cause you 're a body guard who makes 12 bucks an hour . At least it 's honest work . When you should be opening your own private detective agency , like you want . I told you , I can get you the cash . I 'm not gonna use stolen money to open up a business , Daphne . What 's wrong with trying to live like normal people ? It 's boring , for one thing . Well , I will take boring any day over this bizarro world that I 've been in ever since this whole thing got started . Come on , we talked about putting it all behind us and just getting everything back to normal . Just ... Normal . Okay . Fine , you win . Normal it is . Yes , I know that . But she has her own ideas , and now she 's circling the building on your whole operation . She found an article about a guy in Memphis that your team picked up , and , uh , she thinks it 's Sylar . You haven 't ? Well , then I 'm sure it 's all just her imagination . What 's your point ? No . Well , the point is , she 's suspicious and I can 't control her . That 's too bad , mom , because I was counting on you distracting her . If she digs , she 's gonna start finding things , and today is crucial . We have to keep her away from Peter and away from Parkman when we take him down . Mom , do you hear me ? I want Claire as far away from all of this as possible . Mom ? I think we have a bigger problem now . I 'm very different person now . That was a long time ago . Maybe for you . You said you had questions ? Well , ask ' em . How does a boy without a father grow up to be a man ? How does he learn to make the hard decisions he 's gonna have to make in life , the ones only a man can teach ? You want an apology , is that it ? You want to hear I 'm sorry for walking out on you and your mother ? I just want the truth . What about ? That your mother was a sick , infantile woman ? Or that I made a mistake ever to have a child with her ? Let 's start there , because I 'm sure as hell not the son of a man who repairs watches and the woman who collected snow globes . So who am I ? Tell me . You were given to me . By whom ? A man who needed money . Your mother wanted a baby and couldn 't have one . I wanted out of a loveless marriage and was too much of a coward . Seemed like the right answer at the time . Who was he ? My brother . Is he still alive ? You 're telling the truth . Now please leave . So , you planning on seeing him ? See who ? Your brother . He 's in town . Saw him on tv this morning . Ah , I didn 't see that . I haven 't seen him in months . Not really talking at the moment . Huh . Maybe you won 't mind me being honest . He scares the hell out of me . Why is that ? My family 's from Iran . The things he 's talking about , protecting the country from dangerous people , it 's code . It 's not very subtle either . He 's talking about people like me . We 're different , so we 're scary . But you wouldn 't know anything about that . Believe me , I know more than you think . Hello ? Claire ? Peter , thank God . Hey , where are you ? I 'm in New York . We have to stop them . Stop who ? Your mom and Nathan , they 're planning something , something bad . I thought it was Sylar , but it 's them . What are you talking about ? I don 't know . I think they 're talking about rounding up people with abilities . They already started taking them . This guy , in Memphis , he disappeared . Look , wait a minute . Slow down . They were talking on the phone . Your mom , your brother . They were talking about keeping me out of the way , so I wouldn 't find out . They 're going after Matt Parkman today . We have to stop them . Okay , look , just take a deep breath , all right ? I have to warn Matt . I 'll go talk to my mom . When I know something , I 'll give you a call , okay ? I 'm just going a few blocks . 87th and Madison , please . Hello , Peter . Mohinder . This is a coincidence . - Last time I saw you- - - I know . It 's been a long time . Keeping out of trouble ? Trying to . Although you ever get the feeling like you 're meant to do something extraordinary ? I used to . Turns out I was mistaken . - Seen anyone ? - I try not to . Everybody 's under the radar . All except your brother , of course . Well , you know Nathan . Seems like every time I pick up a newspaper or turn on the tv , there he is , right out in the open . He 's not wrong , you know . These powers uncontrolled , unrestricted , I see only danger in that . Do you ? I was living proof of it . Okay , so what happens when the government wants to step in ? That 's a necessary risk I 'm willing to accept . Segregation ? Internment camps ? People hiding underground ? We 'll agree to disagree . How much do I owe you ? Ah , it 's okay . It 's on me . Thank you . Take care of yourself , Mohinder . You too , Peter . Where to , my friend ? Just drive . It 's your dime . Who are you ... and what do you want ? I want you to get in the van . You 're surrounded . Get in . You want to live , get in ! What the hell is going on ? Those guys just tried to kidnap me . - Do you know who they are ? - No . Has anybody contacted you about people with abilities being attacked or abducted ? No . - Have you had any contact with Claire ? - No . - Or Parkman ? - No . What did Peter Petrelli tell you today ? How did you know that- - Where did you come from ? What are you doing ? ! Sorry , Mohinder . Mom ? Mom , are you home ? She 's not here . It 's been a long time , Pete . Sorry I 've been out of touch . I 've been kind of busy . Yeah , what with all the press you 've been doing lately , right ? You know the media , they like new and shiny . Yeah , you got the whole country thinking you 're talking about terrorists , but we both know who you 're really talking about . What can I say , Pete ? Last time I tried to out us , I got shot . I 'm nothing if not a quick study . Just gonna round us all up , get rid of us ? Let me guess , you got our mother involved in this , too . Mom 's got nothing to do with this , Pete . It 's not dad 's plans , it 's all me . You know how I feel about this . We 've been over it . I 'm doing what 's necessary . No , what you 're doing is turning your back on your own kind . It 's one thing to disown me , Nathan . But this , you 're a self-loathing hypocrite . And you wonder why I haven 't returned your calls ? Look , I said some things that were pretty harsh . I admit it . I got a little emotional , but I 've had time to calm down and ... I 'd like to talk to you about some ideas . I 'd like your input , your ... advice . Advice ? What advice could I possibly give you besides " Kiss my ass , Nathan " ? I 'm just trying to extend an olive branch here , that 's all . How about dinner ? Tonight ? Just dinner . I 'll text you when and where . Okay . Just out of curiosity , what can you do these days ? Do ? Your abilities . What are you , a cop ? What 's the last thing you saw me do , Nathan ? You flew . Hey , how the hell did you get out of your tank ? You 're talking to a turtle again . You again . How did you get into my apartment ? What are you doing here ? I came to give you a message . It 's kind of a long trip for a message , don 't you think ? I 'm not really here , Parkman . It 's an illusion , like life . It 's best not to make this any more difficult than it has to be . There are things you 'll come to know along the way in this journey . No. no , no , no , no . I 've taken way too many journeys already . I know it 's difficult to understand , but I went through the same thing when it happened to me . When what happened to you ? The calling to be a prophet . You 've been chosen . No , I didn 't ask to be chosen for anything . All I want to do is live a normal life . But you 're not normal , Parkman , and you 've known that for a while . The world needs you to tell them the future . The future ? How the hell am I gonna do that ? You 'll paint it . I can 't even draw ! You 'll learn . Fine , so what am I supposed- - Ah , there you are , Ando . Ando , this is Hiro , come in ! I know you 're there . Just talk to me . Alright , I 'm sorry I shot you in the arm ... but you 'll thank me , I promise . No , I won 't . Ah ha , I knew it would work . Where are you ? I 'm fighting crime ... just like you wanted You moved ! I 'm looking at you and the Ando-cycle right now . You 're not fighting crime . You 're at A strip club ! You should be using your powers for good , not to pick up girls . The Ando-cycle is a chick magnet . You have a destiny just as I do . A sacred duty to use your powers ... to do great things in the world ... to fight injustice wherever you find- - Hey . What are ... ? No . Don 't ! Hiro ... Hiro . Are you okay ? ! Hiro ! What 's going on ? ! Thank God you 're okay . Claire , what are you doing here ? Did they come ? Did who come ? I don 't know , but you 're in danger . I heard Angela and Nathan talking about sending someone to take you down . Take me down , huh ? I came to warn you . It 's happening again . Sylar , the company ... They are planning something . I don 't know anything about that , but something weird is happening to me . Weird like what ? I made these drawings . Except the thing is I don 't draw , or at least I couldn 't until now . What does this have to do with anything ? I don 't know . These supposed to come true , I think , but they don 't make any sense to me . Is that supposed to be us ? You 're right . That 's us , right now . What is that on your neck ? I know we have dinner plans . There 's just some things I need to talk to you about that can 't wait . Okay . I can only imagine how you feel about me after ... disowning you the way I did . It was selfish , arrogant ... obsessive . Those are your better qualities , Nathan . I know it hasn 't been easy losing me as a brother and a friend . You need to know what I 'm doing is hugely important for this country . For the world . I want to give you the chance to understand that before you make a decision that may change your life forever . I 'm not making any decisions . Okay , I 'm just trying to live my life as normally as I can . That 's just it , Pete . You 're not normal . Pete , please ... Tell me you understand that , so I can make arrangements to provide you with the protection that you need . - Tell me you understand . - Listen ... Why are you asking me this ? What is it that you 're looking for me to say ? I 'm looking for you to tell me you 're with me , and then I 'll leave . I can 't do that . No , I won 't do that . Look , I don 't know what you 're up to , but if it is what I think it is , I 'm gonna fight you with every breath that I have , I swear to God . Okay . Hey , give your big brother a hug ? Of course . I 'm sorry , Pete . Don 't hurt him . Hello ? Anybody home ? Mr. Gray ? Who are you ? I said , who are you ? Simmons . Agent Daniel Simmons . All right , Agent Simmons , where 's the man that lives in this house ? - Where 's Mr. Gray ? - I don 't know . Then we 'll ask another question . I walked into a trap . Who sent you ? A challenge ... fine . I like a challenge . Password . Password ... " Someone important to me " ... Kaito ... Kensei . Ando . Hiro ... We had a couple of situations . Let me guess ... Sylar . We 've lost communication with the team . I told you to put a bullet in the back of his head . Right here . The last thing I need is a body count to try and explain . We 're sending a clean-up crew , but there 's something else . Uncuff her . Give us a minute . I hate you . I know . You 're never gonna get away with this . Someday you might forgive me , Claire . Someday you might not . The important thing is that you get home right now and forget everything you 've just seen . What makes you think I 'm gonna do that ? What , are you gonna threaten my family ? Claire , I have given you a free pass . Don 't make me change my mind . No . Where are you taking them ? Let 's move . Follow me . Nice and easy . Flight 195 . You are cleared for takeoff . Hiro . Peter . Peter , it 's me . Come on , wake up . Come on , we need to get everyone out of here . We need to break these shackles . I don 't have strength anymore . Suresh . Take this stuff off . All right . Suresh ? Come on , wake up . Come on , wake up . Wake everybody up . Go to the cockpit ! We 're gonna make an unexpected landing . Claire ? Mayday , mayday , mayday ! Den mother 3-1 going down ! Bearing two-four-five at nine-eight off Walnut Ridge Vortac ! We have lost pressure !

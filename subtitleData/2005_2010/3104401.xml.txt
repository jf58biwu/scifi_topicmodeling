 My name is detective Brett Hopper , and this is the day that changes everything . Put your hands up ! You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder . Who the hell are you people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this , because I am living the same day ... over and over again . The day is the same but different things happen . Everyday I get an another chance . For every decision , there 's a consequence . I discovered an alliance between a city councilman and street gangs . A skinhead alliance with the Latin Disciples . An alliance that led to Garza 's murder . All brokered by councilman Booth and his little lap dog . Turns out that Garza tried to send me a fax the night he died . Miguel Dominguez ? What would Garza send this to you ? He 's been in Pelican Bay since 89 . There 's no way he could 've killed anyone in 91 , let alone Garza . So , somehow , I 've got to catch Dominguez and find the answers that would clear my name . Flying to San Francisco . Very romantic . San Francisco ... you alone ... First off , it 's not even San Francisco . It 's Pelican Bay . It 's all the way out of Nowhere Ville and believe me , the last thing it is , is romantic . Do you know what a Supermax is ? Sure , some big grocery store where you buy things in bulk . Hello ! I was married to a cop . Supermax is like a fortress of solitude to violent offenders . You 're right , well , I gotta go see this guy there , Miguel Dominguez . He 's serving five consecutive life sentences for murder . Why do you have to go ? Miguel Dominguez ... Why would Garza send this to you ? This guy wants me to go see him . He 's a key to this murder case I 'm working on . That 's yours ? That 's okay , I got it . Hey . You know , can I give you a call back ? Who 's that ? It 's just work . So , what time do you want me to pick you up in the morning ? I got that covered . - Are you sure ? - Yeah , I mean , if today is like the passed few , by the time you wake up , I 'll be back . - Excuse me ... - What ? I 'm hearing a sort of horrible clang . I think we should tell the captain and turn back . Was this different from the clang you heard just a couple of minutes ago ? This one sounds even more dangerous . I fly five days a week all over the world . Airplanes are safer than cars . This is a silver gleaming death machine . It 's nice talking to you , sir . So do you really travel that much ? San Francisco , Seattle , Japan . Back to France next week . I 've been to Paris twelve times . Sounds fun . Of course , I 've only seen the Eiffel tower from my hotel window . I keep saying I 'm gonna go but , you know how it is , every time it 's the same thing . Tell me about it . Got to celebrate my birthday twice though . 'Cause of the international day line . I 'm on way back from Sydney . Today what day is it in Australia ? Well , see , seventeen hours ahead , so that would make it ... Tomorrow . Yeah , I guess it would . I wish I could get there . - Where ? Tomorrow ? - Yeah . Seems like today is going pretty well . You gotta live for the moment , right ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's what ... my girlfriend keeps telling me . Lucky girl . Excuse me , does he even know that I 'm here ? You don 't have an appointment , Detective . You 'll have to wait . Yes ma 'am , I 've been waiting for three hours . Detective ... Shelten , is it ? Yes , Chad Shelten . Come on . You understand that I can 't just stop my day because you drop in . I appreciate you seeing me , I won 't take you up much of your time . I need to speak with one of your prisoners , Miguel Dominguez . I 'm afraid I can 't accommodate that , Detective . An assistant D.A. was murdered last night in Los Angeles . Dominguez may have some information on the killer . A man who spent the last 17 years in prison would have information on a murder that happened last night ? I realize how that may sound ... I 'm afraid you come at a bad time , Detective . Dominguez shanked a guard a few days ago . That 's his third incident this year and we put him in solitary confinement . No visitors . No exceptions . I really need to speak with him . I 'm sorry . - Five minutes . - Detective . You 've come a long way for nothing . Yes . Bob Nedgo , I have Mr. Detweiler returning . For every decision , there 's a consequence . Good luck with your case , Detective . See you soon . Everything is gonna be fine . Nothing 's gonna happen to this plane . How do you know ? Because my day is repeating . I was here yesterday and this plane doesn 't crash . I watch TV . Planes crash all the time . So , if your day is repeating ... What do you know about me ? I hope we didn 't keep you waiting too long . Detective Shelten , is it ? Yeah . And ... Detweiler sent you ? If you don 't mind me asking , what exactly is your association with him ? We share a common interest . And he sent you here for me ? Relax , he just wants to know what happened with the guard that Dominguez shanked . That 's being handled . I sort of promised I 'd talk to him . See what went down . You want to talk to Dominguez ? Detweiler wants to know the whole story . Get the hell out of my office . He 's not gonna be too pleased with you filling me out like this . Who ? Detweiler ? Detweiler didn 't send you here . Mr. Parrison , get a guard in here to escort this gentleman off the facility . Hey man , why don 't you take this ? It 'll help you relax . Thanks . Mister Pusherman . But I 'll just say no . I 'm a police officer . Narcotics Unit . This is a prescription med , it helps relieve anxiety . You 're gonna take this , and you 're gonna stop moaning about how unsafe you think the plane is . You 're scaring the others passengers . Take it . Okay , thank you . And , the next time you 're in Paris , you should visit the Eiffel tower . Don 't wait . So , Detweiler sent you ? Told me to get up here as soon as I could . You don 't mind me asking what ... what exactly is your association with him ? Fencik and Buchatler were busy . Listen , I 'm not here to bust your hump . Detweiler is just a little concerned about this Dominguez situation . Well , I already spoke to him about it . Come on , you know how he gets . Always telling everybody how ... serious he is . I told him we shouldn 't put Dominguez in Gen Pop . Now he 's upset that there is a price to pay . Well , he 's a tough guy to work for . Don 't I know it ... I 've spent 12 years under that man since the time when he was a warden . I swear to God , if I never hear those two words again ... Decision ... Consequence . So , what do you need from me ? You 've got five minutes . Where the hell are you ? Some wrong with the food ? Another guy in a tub . I staked that place out for a week . - Never once was that guy ... - So you did what you have to do . Yeah , well , feels ... Unprofessional . Unprofessional is yapping about it all morning . There bigger problem than some guy flowed in his tub . - What ? The GPS thing ? - Yeah , the GPS thing . How we 're gonna find Hopper without it ? Call some favors . OK , think your guys can help us out ? We 're cruising brown town looking for that gang banger from the safe house . Great . This job is a lot easier now . All we 've to do is take out the trash . Slow down , you 're gonna choke . When is the last time you ate ? Couldn 't say . Did you bring the Dominguez file ? OK , I 'll buy it . Why are you looking at a guy who 's been in lock-up for 17 years ? I think he killed Garza . Hopper , the only thing this guy is killing is time . They call him " El Llor√≥n " . The Crying Man . They say he 's a ghost . He can walk the walls , he sees everything , hears everything . Even though he 's in locked up , people fear him like he 's the Boogie Man . What 's he in for ? Killed his whole family . Both parents , kid sister . They found him covered in blood , at the breakfast table , just sitting , eating his cereal . OK , he 's a psychopath . But this guy 's on ice in Pelican Bay . Even ghost don 't get over there . That 's what I thought , but the magic trick isn 't walking through walls . He 's left to the back door . You 're telling me somebody let this guy out of prison ? Yeah . I 've a CI , Damien Ortiz , he 's about to testify about contract killings within the Latin Disciples . Now I think that LDs are using Dominguez to do all the dirty work . But why go through all of this trouble ? The streets are full of bangers who whack their best friends for a c-note or an 8-ball . It 's the perfect alibi . If he 's behind bars , there 's no way he could possibly pull the trigger . OK , suppose it 's true . How you 're gonna prove it ? OK , what do you need ? I need you to look into unsolved homicides over the passed 17 years . MO : one shot to the head , two to the body . Execution style . Same way Garza went down . Go see Detective Choi at Robbery / Homicide . He 'll listen . See if Dominguez left prints at any of the crime scenes . But if this Dominguez guy is as good as you say he 's , you think he 'd be careless enough to leave a print ? Yeah , he did it before . He killed this girl named Isabelle Contreras . He left one there . Of course , he could just be taunting the police , telling us he can 't be caught . But you 're gonna try anyway ? Yeah , I 'm being framed for a murder he committed . I gotta to find him . You said it , this guy 's a ghost . How you 're gonna do that ? By getting my informer to inform . You pull me out of my niece 's birthday for this ? I 'll ask them to save you a piece of birthday cake . No , man . I 'm not doing this . We 're through , Hop ! I know that the LDs are into murder for hire . I also know that 's why Baxter and the feds want you to testify . - How the hell you know that ? - You were gonna give my name ? Louis Torrez . He 's the one who 's running all the hits . This bastard thinks he can pull on our faces , he 's soon no smaller than a gang banger ? He 's sailing his own disciples down the river . - You want him ? - He 's protected , Hop ! - He 's connected ... - To a councilman named Tobias Booth . Yeah , I know . He 's going down too . Look at you , Detective Hopper with the 411 . Alright . I 'm listening . You can get Torrez after I get what I need from him . Oh yeah ! What 's that ? El Llor√≥n . Use the front . - What ? - He 's the LDs secret weapon . Torrez is the dispatcher . Someone orders a hit , Torrez makes the call , El Llor√≥n pulls out , he 's got a " out of the jail " free card . You didn 't know that , did you ? Not about El Llor√≥n . - I 'd stay clear ... - I gotta have him . The Crying Man . If this whole thing goes down the way I think , we could pull them all away . Torrez , Booth , even El Llor√≥n . - So they do a couple of years ? - No , we pull them away for good . Call the feds , whoever we need . That 's gonna leave a lot more room at the top of the LD food chain . New for an entrepreneur . A young man with vision . I know a guy like that . Let me introduce one of the greatest success stories of our anti gang initiative . Louis Torrez joined the Latin Disciples at the age of 14 . Today , Louis is the key contributor to this community , a member of ... Oh , yeah ! Vato ! You think anyone believes that crap about you leaving that life behind ? How would you believe what I say ? I don 't buy it either . Andrea Battle . I 'm looking for Detective Choi . Battle ? Hopper 's partner ? Spivak , I 'm in charge of the Garza murder . Anything you have to say to Choi , you say to me . I need to look through your files on cold case murders . Anything that went down execution style in the last 17 years . Execution style , that 's good . What ? I admire what you do to help your partner , but you might have just deep-sixed him . Really ? How 's that ? Garza was killed execution style , but we didn 't release that information . Other than detectives of the scene , the only other person that knew that little detail is the killer . See , that 's the problem . 'Cause I happen to know Brett Hopper didn 't kill anyone . Great . Have him come in and tell someone about it . You play ball . I let you pull all the cases you want . I have a better idea . I pull the cases that I want , you play ball with yourself . Easy ! What we 're gonna to do is real simple . You tell me where El Llor√≥n is , you walk away . You don 't , I walk away , and I leave you with Damien . - I don 't know what you talking about . - Stop it ! I know he escaped from prison , I know he killed Garza , and I know you know where the hell he is . You 're mistaken . I work for councilman Booth ! At least the Latin Disciples had more respect for who they are . I left that life behind . You can lie , ese , but you ain 't done Let me just talked to him ! Vamo ! I got this . Easy , easy . Son of a bitch . You 're gonna have to get that little tattoo removed ? You 're gonna rip him off or make him talk ? Shut up ! I 'm still a cop . Yeah , shut up ! What is this ? Whose address is this ? That ? That 's muy importante . That 's where I hook up with Damien 's mother . Come on ! - Come on . - Come on ! Vamo ! - You know what they call you ? - Think I give a damn ? - You wanna me say why we call you LD ? - What ? - What ? - La Dama ! The woman ! I 'm cool , Hop . - I 'm cool , right ? - Right ? - I 'm good . - Yeah , run away ! You think it 's ... Who the hell 's gonna know , cabr√≥n ? Who 's running ? We are . Wait ! You gotta tell me about Dominguez . El Llor√≥n ... He 's not the ... What ? Torrez ! What the hell did you do ? Watch it , Hop ! Watch it ! You did it again ! - I knew I couldn 't trust you . - What the hell are you talking about ? You say I wouldn 't play bad cop for you ? I came here to get my note ! Got it ? You got a problem with that ? You could lay down right next to that bitch ! What are you doing ? What do you think ? You think I 'm gonna stay here ? I 'm getting the hell out of here , Hop . You should too . Spivak ! Detective Battle ? You found me a happy end ? No , but I found these . Two cold case hits match and the same MO as Garza : One to the head , two to the chest . And both crime scenes had errant prints belonging to one guy . Miguel Dominguez , who 's that ? Garza 's killer . Hold on , this guy was in prison when the murder was committed . Listen . I know what I 'm suggesting might sound a little ... - Insane ? - Implausible . It 's Dominguez . We just need to find an errant print from the Garza scene . Oh , we 've got an errant print ... On the gun . It belongs to Hopper . I don 't know your partner , but ... He 's our guy . I wanna recheck the gun . - You 're reaching , Battle . - Then let me reach ! It 's how we found Hoffa right ? Beneath the gold post at the metal ends . I need to see the gun from the Garza murder . You 're the IO ? - Not but I ... - I am . Do what she wants . Ok , just give me a second . We don 't have the gun . What do you mean ? It 's been checked out . Checked out by who ? Detective ... Spyvak . I 'm Spyvak ! - Yeah . - I 'm Detective Brett Hopper . I 'm conducting a police investigation . I 'd like to ask you a few questions . My cousin has one of those and he ain 't a real cop . Show me something else . - What do you want , Brett Hopper ? - May I come in ? Miss Zapanta , you live here by yourself ? Alma . Yeah , just me . Do you know a man named Louis Torrez ? Tobias Booth ? Doesn 't sound like my flavor . What about Miguel Dominguez ? I don 't know , I don 't think so . You don 't know or you just don 't remember . Men in my life come and go , I don 't know who 's got a name . What is this really about ? I found your address in a man 's wallet . Louis Torrez . I think you may be in danger . Maybe he just wanted to buy a painting . Well , I have reason believe he is a dispatcher for a contract killer . He had your address . - You could be his next target . - Why would anybody wanna kill me ? Excuse me . - Andrea , what did you get ? - You were right . I 've found Dominguez 's prints on two other crime scenes . But not at Garza 's . - What ? Did you recheck the gun ? - I tried : only one problem . - It 's gone . - What do you mean " gone " ? Chain of evidence says Spyvak signed out . But I was with him , I 'm telling you he had no idea . Alright , it means I gotta go back tomorrow and get the gun . What are you talking about ? Thanks . I gotta stop doing that . Miss Zapanta , is there anyone that you think would wanna harm you ? Yeah . But they 're dead . What do you mean ? I can take care of myself , detective . Why don 't you find someone else to save ? Hey , it 's me . Thank God . I 've been so worried . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry I haven 't had time to ... call you today . I just want to make sure you 're okay . - make sure you were safe . - I 'm fine why wouldn 't I be ? I know you 've been hearing a lot of crazy things about me today You need to know , I 'm trying to clear my name . What 's going on ? Where are you ? I 'm waiting for this guy , Miguel Dominguez . Sorry I can 't tell you more . Are you with Chad ? Yeah . How did you know ? It doesn 't matter , just ... stay with him tonight , OK ? Okay . I see you tomorrow . Alright baby ? I promise , I see you tomorrow . Hopper ? - Yeah . - What did he say ? That I should stay here with you . Really ? You 've got a hell of a tasted man . Where do you keep the blankets ? Hall closet . Everything okay ? Yeah , one of my bulbs burned out . Where do you keep spares ? In the kitchen . Hey ! Morning . You 're in a good mood , this morning . There 's this murder case I 've been trying to close off . Trying to put behind me and ... - They got finally got a handle on it . - Really ? Yeah , Andrea came up with some evidence that kinda support this theory I got going on , so ... That 's great news . I still have to catch the guy , but ... - We should celebrate . - OK . Tonight . - Unless you wanna ... - Unless I wanna what ? Unless I wanna what ? No , I gotta go to the house and see what 's up to Rambis , I gotta get this gun , maybe ... get it print in . I got this stuff too ... I 'm rather busy . Zapanta . Z-A-P-A-N-T-A . First name : Alma . 2216 Moulton Avenue . - Got that ? - Yeah . - What 's so important about this girl ? - She may be the target of a contract killing . Anything you can find will be helpful . I 'll look into it . Did you get the gun yet ? I 'm on the way to my apartment right now . Had to help ... Rita ... with some stuff . Is that what the kids are calling it these days ? I 've got IA at 11a.m. Don 't let your stuff make me late . Hey , buddy . What 's up ? Want some treats ? Let 's go ! Hey , Mr. Hopper ! Your apartment has a leak . I know , I was just coming up to investigate . No problem , I 'll tell the plumbers . - What you doing Mr. Hopper ? - Shut up ! Very bad . He was not supposed to move in here for a week . - Who ? - The new tenant , Mr. Jarvik . I should charge him for this . They were running surveillance on me . Mr. Zeitoun , these plumbers- - were they two of them ? Tall white dudes ? - Dark jackets ? - Yes . Why would they do this ? I just painted these walls . Upstairs . Move ! It 's Jarvik . He must have come in here to clean and surprised them . Them ? Who is " them " ? The men that you saw weren 't plumbers . Their names are Fencik and Buchalter . They 're parked across the street in a blue Sedan . They killed him . Police ! Open up ! What 's .. What are you doing ? Open the door and don 't let them in . - Why ? - Don 't let them in , I 'm the police . Don 't let in ! Heard some yelling . Is everything alright ? Yes , everything is fine , no problem . Have you seen your tenant from downstairs ? Yes , absolutely ... No . - Have you seen him or not ? - He was here , - but no , he 's not ... There is leak ! - Where 's Hopper ? - Where is he ? - I think he 's taking care of the dead man in the tub . Blue Jay , what 's your status ? Blue Jay ! No sign of Hopper , sir . You and me , we 're gonna talk . Tacos , uh ? - Breakfast of champions . - I 'm out for a run this morning . - Worked up an appetite . - I know . Not many people actually outrun SWAT . The gun 's in there . I don 't even wanna know how you got this . They planted it in my apartment . They 're gonna try and tell the prints on it are mine . I 've a feeling the real killer left it as a calling card . I 'm running down this ID . Say you got it from a drug bust or some , don 't say you got it for me . - And don 't let it out of your sight . - You think someone 'd tamper with it ? Think it might get up and walk away . So I ran a background on Alma Zapanta No prior , just got speeding tickets . There 's gotta be something . There is one thing . I checked with the county records and apparently she grew up in foster care . Horrible story . The parents were murdered . Ever found the guy who did it ? It was her brother . He almost killed her after he got the parents . Wait , Zapanta ? Is that her real name ? No . Birth name was Dominguez , why ? Alma Dominguez . She 's El Llor√≥n 's sister . Are you ready Mr. Zeitoun ? Everybody face forward . Do you recognize any of these men ? Those men . Those two . Numbers three and six . They are the plumbers . They 're the ones who put Mr. Jarvik in tub . They did not fix leak . Fencik and Buchalter . They 're ex-sheriff 's deputies . Nothing worse than a dirty cop . Is he tied to one of the other ass through the wall ? To make you happier , you can bog ' em 1st degree murder . I 'm Detective Brett Hopper . - Brett Hopper ? - May I come in ? I need to speak to you about your brother . - I don 't have a brother . - His name is Miguel Dominguez . That 's your given name , isn 't it ? Alma Dominguez ? You must have me confused with someone else . His name is Miguel . He also goes by El Llor√≥n . The Crying Man . He killed your parents , he tried to kill you . You don 't know anything about me . I know you 're lying . You need to leave . You 've been hiding from him ever since . That 's why you changed your name ? - Just leave ! - If he knows you 're alive , he 's gonna come back after you , finish what he started . Your brother 's been in prison 17 years - and you 're still scared ! - Just stop it ! Oh my God . I knew this day would come . You want everybody to think you 're dead , don 't you ? I am dead . Changing my name was the only way to be safe . I 'm sorry , but I think somebody out there already knows the truth . I found your address in a man 's wallet . Louis Torrez . I think he may have tracked you down on behalf of your brother . - My brother 's in prison . - No , he got out . Killed someone last night . Alberto Garza . And I don 't think he 's done . How could you know all this ? Excuse me . I have to take this . The gun you gave me , your prints weren 't on it . Were there any prints on it ? Rednazki found an unspent round in the clip . There 's one clean print on the casing , but it doesn 't make any sense . Yes , because it belong to this guy , Miguel Dominguez , locked up in Pelican Bay . How did you ... Is that the guy you thought was Alma 's fondest brother ? Yeah , and I 'm afraid she may be his next victim . - Hopper , the guy 's in prison . - Andrea , listen to me . I need you to go to Robbery / Homicide . Find Detective Choi , he 'll listen . Alright , tell him everything , have him run ballistics . Tell him the gun should match the three bullets in Garza 's body . I 'm on it . He just showed ... at my door ... That 's what I 'm telling you . No , his name is Brett Hopper . He 's looking for you . He knows about you , the prison , Torrez ... He 's standing right here in front of me . Yeah , I 'll tell him . How could you talk to him ? How could you protect that monster after what he did to your family ? - After what he did to you ? - He didn 't to this to me ! My father did this to me and my mother stood there and watched . They 're the monsters , my brother tried to save me . Are you his contact ? Torrez comes here to you . You give El Llor√≥n the orders . You know why they call him the crying man ? You think those tears are for the people he kills ? El Llor√≥n cries for me . You were talking to him and you said I 'll tell him what ? Tell me what ? My brother said that you don 't have to find El Llor√≥n . El Llor√≥n will find you . Hey ... I 've been meaning to tell you : I knocked down that wall you hated in the kitchen . You were right . Makes the whole place feel bigger . You should come over check it out some time . Hey , this is Rita ... Leave the message . - What ? - You need to change that ringtone . I like it . Some people just don 't quit . Where do you keep your blankets ? Aren 't you glad you finally picked up that phone ? I 'm a ghost . I 'll be back . And you 'll be dead . You ... and everyone you love . Miguel Dominguez , you 're under arrest for the murder of Alberto Garza . You have the right to remain silent , anything you say can and will be used against you ... Dominguez 's prints are on the murder weapon . We may have a few loose ends , but everybody can see it as it is , about now . And the Feds are on their way . They 'll make sure Dominguez never steps out of a cell again . They 're also looking into the names that you provided . Conrad Detweiler , Tobias Booth . And we 'll bring in Mrs. Garza back in sort out her conflict in testimony . Alright , good . It 's been a long way to assist you , Hop . Don 't know how you figured it all out so fast . It wasn 't as fast as it looks . Well , it 's over . Now you 're a free man . Go home , get some sleep , you both look like you could use some . Yeah , the sooner we can put this day behind us , the better . Took the words right out of my mouth . Excuse me . Something wrong ? Everything 's gonna be OK . I think we finally figured it out . You must be glad this day is over . You wanna watch the sunrise with me ? I 'll be right back . ... decision ... consequence ... You 're a free man . Here comes the sun ! You 're gonna miss it ! Morning . Something wrong ?

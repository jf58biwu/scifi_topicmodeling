 Fansubbed 4 Cinemageddon by BaseGBG The intergalactic war had been raging for ten years Emperor Zing used his doomsday weapon to control the galaxy . Planet after planet surrendered . There was almost no hope . The remnants of the once so mighty galactic army gathered for a final attack . Destiny depended on one man . The man , the myth , the legend . Chill out , boy . I ´ ll heat things up . It ´ s time to kiss that Wurlitzer goodbye , Mr. Zing . You got the point ? The mission was not over with the fall of emperor Zing . The green crystal , a mighty energy source must be destroyed . Touching it meant mortal danger . The Galactic Heroes sent it into the black hole so that it would be lost forever . What is a black hole ? Where do things go ? Kenny ? - What did you say ? - What is a black hole ? - " Welcome to Memorymatic ... " - You are not allowed to use that . You should know this yourself . And you probably forget to charge it . No I didn 't . Yes , I have forgotten it . Kenny , why are you here at the academy , year after year ? I would like to ask you that . What do you mean ? That , uh ... I mean that the one ... Like Lenny once down the trash can , I mean . " I will scare the janitor . " Listen carefully . A black hole is a kind of trash can . Or a kind of waste disposal . Or a kind of space toilet if you like . Everything flushed down a black hole disappear forever . General Sudoko . A hot tip for everyone : imagine a toilet in space . Space toilet , ordinary toilet . Black hole , brown hole . Sporty , clever and beautiful . Pontus , come here . About last weeks parent-teacher meeting ... Tell your parents we don ´ t want any former circus artists running around making a fool of themselves . It ´ s embarrassing . You get that , right ? - Yes , yes ... - Thank you . Nodding is enough . This is not a conversation between two equal persons . Keep a low profile appropriate for a social misfit like you . I promise . Pontus ? - Straighten up . - Ok . " Hello Miranda . My name is Pontus . " " And I like rounders . " " Imagine that the rings around Saturn consists of " ... - What are you looking at ? - Nothing . I am practicing for a presen ... Stop it . Let me go . I suggest that you stay away from Miranda . It would be bad if we were enemies . Hello ? Hello ! What are they doing in this school ? I have to release him . Moments with ClownIce are moments to remember . - Hello . Ice cream as usual ? - What ´ s on the menu ? You can get ClownIce on a stick or not . Wow , that 's a tough one . I will have ... uh ... - Think about it and I will get some . - I will think about it . We use the purest ice from the depth of the ice planet . ClownIce ice cream . A tasteless experience . Look ! It ´ s a commercial for the ice cream I ´ ve got here . That ´ s déjà-vu , right ? No , it ´ s not déjà-vu . We interrupt for a message from Rutger Oversmart . Galaxy friends . I promise to straighten up the economy of the universe just like I have made ClownIce the most profitable company in the galaxy . He makes the ice cream I have here ! That is why you can feel secure with me as your leader . - That ´ s déjà-vu , right ? - No , Kenny . It is not . Quality of life is my motto . - What happened this time ? - What happened ? He is stuck . - Any witnesses ? - No , no one saw or heard anything . I guess it ´ s possible he stuck his own head in the toilet . What are you whining about ? It must be nice to pass through the hallway without the limping for once . Be quiet ! This is not a kindergarten . Go on . This exercise will teach you the basics of space flight . To the far right you have the speedometer . The stick to your left is the throttle . In the middle is the control stick . Put your right hand on the control stick and your left hand on the throttle . Six ! Six ! One can go drifting with these . All sticks and levers are mockups and does not work except the red lever here . Do NOT touch it . It says something here . " ... touch " ... " ... touch " ... " Drifting " , that ´ s what it says . It is very important to keep your distance to avoid collisions . - Ischlo pischlo ! - But ... But ... Try to swim like a dog . Like a dog . Bow-wow . - Bow-wow . Bow-wow . - No more help , please . This is where we produce more than one million ice creams every week . Rutger Oversmart , the company founder said : " Everyone who wants ice cream should be able to buy our ice cream . " Let ´ s go to the ice crusher . Rutger ! Excuse me . I ´ m sorry to bother you . I want to talk about two things . Krister is retiring this Friday . I think we all can chip in for a cuckoo clock . - Do you want me to die ? Do you ? - No . I know you are looking for emperor Zings crystal so that you can get a healthy body run for presidency and rule the galaxy . But it feels like the spirit of our community is not a priority . If you want to remain a part of this community you better have something more interesting to tell me ! We have found a concrete structure in sector 24 . It may be Zings old bunker . Wollie bollie . I won these golden scissors in a cutting contest . Top of the line . - Is it Lenny the hairdresser ? - Is it Kenny the student ? - Yeah , but you . - Yeah , but you . Can you cut my nails ? And a paper into two or three pieces ? Can I borrow your Hairminator ? Oh , that ´ s right . You haven 't got one . You have not graduated yet . Do you comb hair top to bottom , or bottom to top ? Bottom to top . Ischlo pischlo ! - Ischlo pischlo . Can you do this ? - Yes . Can you do this ? Can you do this ? - Mom , Kenny is eating the shampoo . - No I ´ m not . Mom ! Kenny , my little friend . - I need to borrow more money . - No more . You will have to be a hairdresser . - Exactly , I need to be a galactic hero . - I know . What did you say ? - What ? - What ? - I know . You can be a hairdresser . - Exactly . I need to be a galactic hero . - What ? - No more money . It ´ s over . - You can be a hairdresser . - Ischlo pischlo . - Come on ! - We will get you ! Pontus . Pontus . Come out and play . Pontus , come out and play . Come here . This way . Well , here is no crystal . Poor Rutger , looking for so long . Shut up , shut up , shut up ! A light is lit here . Shall I press the button ? Shall I press the button ? The crystal is fitted with a tracking device . It can be traced no matter where it is . - What the hell are you doing ? ! - I pressed the button . It is on the planet Earth . Form an expedition and get the crystal at once . Pontus , me and dad is going to perform magic on a trailer convention in Bulgaria . If the food is gone you can find apples in the neighbors ' yard . - And don ´ t trash anything . Bye ! - Ok . It ´ s time for your final exams . 4000 points to be Captain . 2000 points to be Sergeant . Minimum to pass graduation is 1000 points . These are your missions : Save the universe 8000p Capture super villain 4000p Ticket speeders 50p You have 48 hours . Wollie bollie . Wollie bollie ! Listen , something came up ... How many speeders do I have to ticket to not be a hairdresser ? You can try to divide 1000 by 50 . If you can ´ t do that ... then you are not hero material . Oh , thanks . He said I am a hero . Waiting out here ... That ´ s really fast . It ´ s a Galactic Hero . Go , Andreas . - You were going a bit fast there . - No , it wasn ´ t me . Show me your flying certificate and the important papers in the glove box . Andreas , we have to get away . Go ! * Wanted * I don ´ t have to be a hairdresser . Guess what ? You are really wanted . No , not the black hole . Not good . Not good . Hi , Miranda . My name is Pontus . You are good at rounders , so am I. Let 's play some rounders some day . It seems like you didn ´ t understand me before . I told you to stay away from ... Hello , Miranda . I ´ m Pontus . How about playing rounders some day ? We can do whatever you want to . Oops . Pontus ! Do you have to make my life a living hell every day ? You limp around looking miserable . Do you have to destroy things too ? Mommy ! Gary ? Gary , my baby boy . Gary ? I ´ m sorry . Welcome to Magma Tech Sweden . You will see the first " Magma " - drill- - the future source for all energy needs . Many people think this is the site for secret military projects but that is nothing more than rumors spread by people with vivid imagination . - Who are you ? - What ? Wollie bollie . Kenny Starfighter . Galactic Hero-student . Well , now it looks more like hairdresser . I think . Maybe . - What have you done to my room ? - It was Sudoko . He told me there was nothing in the black hole . But that wall was there . - By the way , where am I ? - Harebell road number 6 . - What ? - Harebell road number 6 . - That means nothing to me . - In Forserum . - The planet Forserum ? - No , we live on the planet Earth . - Memorymatic , information about planet Earth . - Low power . Please charge battery . - No , I will not charge it . Tell me . - Please charge battery . Don ´ t get one of these boxes . It only says " charge battery " . - Maybe you should charge it then . - Don ´ t you start too . Charge , charge . I refuse to charge it while everyone is telling me to . MAYBE when no one tells me . - Are you from another planet ? - I am from the planet Mylta . Traveled through the black hole . Can you help me put my spaceship together ? - Did everything go as planned ? - It was a bumpy atmosphere entry . But it seems like a pleasant planet . They had miniature golf , cows , power plants and horses . Perhaps you don ´ t care about the journey . - Is something wrong ? - The crystal has no power . It is empty . I was looking forward to a new magnificent body be able to do things myself . Without incompetent helpers ! Is it just your looks and you body that stops you from achieving your goals ? Actually , you can be rather grumpy and even unpleasant . Yes , you are right . I will have to solve my physical shortcomings some other way . Thank you for trying . Many thanks . It ´ s unusual for you to be so nice . I ´ m glad . Not at all . I am very pleased with you . Can you go to ice crusher 2 ? There is something wrong with it . Please crawl inside to see what ´ s wrong . Will do . I ´ m sure it ´ s a switch . Or a fuse . Magma Tech Sweden has the energy you need for your invention . Good . One more thing ... Get me the toughest and most dangerous super villains in the entire galaxy for a job interview With huge honor ! My apologies . I mean ... will do . My parents wants me to be a hairdresser if I don ´ t graduate . - That ´ s tough on me , right ? - Yes . - Do you have rotten parents ? - We don ´ t talk much . They fight a lot . - What ? - They fight a lot . - Where is this supposed to be ? - On the side . - I found something yesterday . - I know . Do you ? It was like a pod with a glowing thing in it . Yes . Do you know someone who knows about spaceships ? Or someone smart ? Is that all you can do ? - Knock over a mango ? - Yepp . - Don ´ t call us . - We ´ ll call you . Next ! Captain Chaos ! That ´ s right . I make my victims go mad . Let me demonstrate . - No - But wait . Look at that . It was only a mirage . Luckily I didn ´ t produce three , four , up to 50 different plants . - The confusion would make me faint . - Thank you , that ´ s enough . But that is only one example . Imagine soap dispensers , toilet brushes . Endless possibilities . Make a deal today and you ´ ll get a juicer for free . Ouch ! Totally uncalled for . Hit a man with glasses . How mature . The Bounty hunters Association presents : Earth , Wind and Fire ! You ´ re hired . This little boy from Earth has taken something of mine . You have every right to use any violence necessary but you must bring him to me alive . I will see you downstairs . - Do you know anyone smart ? - Yes , this one girl : Miranda . She ´ s smarter than all the teachers . But I can ´ t talk to her . Good , there ´ s someone smart but I cannot talk to her . Good information . You can talk to her . But I can ´ t . - Are you in love ? - No ? Don ´ t fall in love . Never ever do that . - She ´ s mad at me . - That ´ s right . That ´ s what girls are like . They are either mad or in love . Or maybe it was the other way around . - Hey , guess what ... - What ? I can teach you all about girls . It ´ s really easy . - Are you rich ? - No . - Are you famous ? - No . - Well then , do you have a record deal ? - No . You could have told me that . This is going to be really tough . Really tough ! Miranda ? - Nice to see you again . Last time was so nice . - She seems really nice . I am really sorry about that . But I brought someone I think you ´ ll find interesting . Wollie bollie . Your turn . - Kenny crashed into my room . - No I didn ´ t . I just made a hard landing . He says he is from a another planet . - Yes . I am from the planet Mylta . - You are not from another planet . - Yes I am . - No . - Yes ! - No ! Look at this . I look really cool . He doesn ´ t . So I am from another planet . - Do you really expect me to believe that ? - Yes please , and then we can address the problem . - I don ´ t want to be a hairdresser . - Ok . What do you want to be then ? Galactic Hero of course . But I don ´ t even know how to get home . - Try Google maps . - I know . - Do you believe him ? What do you want ? - I figured ... like ... You are interested in space so maybe this would be interesting . That would take your mind of your model that I destroyed . Think of my problems instead . Look , a lady ! - Isn ´ t it Pontus ? - Oops . Ischlo pischlo ! Ouch , ouch , ouch . Right on the lump between my butt cheeks . - What the hell is going on ? - Bounty hunters . They are like regular hunters but they hunt for a bounty . - We know what bounty hunters are . - Excuse me for explaining then . Oops . Faster ! Faster ! Faster ! Mr. Smart . We have located the boy . He is with a Galactic Hero . Then you can track his Memorymatic . It has an old tracking device that transmits on channel 29 . But I guess you knew that . I ran out of fuel . Mad . - What ´ s the matter ? - Don ´ t move . - Does it hurt ? - No . What is it ? Let me look . Let me look . What is it ? Am I bleeding ? No . It ´ s nothing . You can see your house from here . See ? Over there . - You live across town , right ? - Yes . Did your parents let lose a lot of rabbits at school last week ? - They are part-time magicians . - Cool . - What are they doing the rest of the time ? - They only work part-time . My parents are planning my schedule for the week right now . - Do you want to go home ? - No . They plan my entire life . When to wake up , what to wear , eat , drink , when to go outside . It always seems like you have it real nice . You eat cinnamon buns , have kitchen chairs ... Are you spying on me ? No , not spying . Sometimes I can feel the smell of cinnamon buns ... and think ... Ice cream ... Hairdresser ... Ice cream ... - Are you alive ? Didn ´ t you die ? - I have been trying to tell you . I found a glowing stone . I am different since I touched it . It must have been a magic space stone or something . - What ? - A magic space stone . - Was it green and glowing ? - Yes . - You didn ´ t touch it , right ? - Yes - Not with your fingers , right ? - Yes . Ischlo pischlo ! It was nice to meet you . I didn ´ t pay much attention in class - but I definitively know that you never should touch emperor Zings crystal . Why not ? I have no idea . There are limits to how much you can learn , you know . Where was it ? - It was here yesterday . - It ´ s just rocks here . Great . Ischlo pischlo . I wish I had a control cabin . - A control cabin ? - Then I could call general Sudoko . I could tell him about the bounty hunters and the crystal and I would get my exam . But I knocked it into the black hole . - Can ´ t it be on Earth , like you ? - I doubt it . Is there no research about the black hole and how it works ? We use ours as a space toilet for trash like garden gnomes and nuclear waste . Brown hole , regular toilet . Black hole , space toilet . So it IS a black hole ? It can be a wormhole . How fresh . This hole is black . Let 's say it ´ s a black hole with a oneway event horizon that is not connected to a white hole , according to Einstein-Rosenberger . - I was just about to say that . - Me too . Einstein and stuff . I realized that a long time ago but then we went here and ... Kenny , I have calculated the time - when the control cabin flew into the black hole . I think it hit Earth somewhere in the ocean next to Mexico . Wollie bollie . Let 's go there then . It ´ s on the other side of the planet . Ischlo pischlo . You obviously want me to be a hairdresser . - Did you adjust for Earth 's rotation ? - Exactly , did you do that ? - Oh , I ´ m so stupid . - Yes , you suck at calculating . Ok . It crashed 3 kilometers east of where Kenny crashed . Three kilometers ? - Or ? - It ´ s not that far . - Are you really going with us ? - Why not ? - You don ´ t have to get involved . - I think I already am . I will protect you . Are you going to kiss now ? I want action . Or an ice cream . No , action . No , ice cream . No , action . I want both action and ice cream . That must be it . - What do that sign say ? - " Animals are fun " . I know . - It ´ s locked . - We can climb over it . - It says " Warning ! Electrified " . - Only the sign , not the fence . MemoryMatic is now charged . Thank you for using our products . - You ´ re welcome . - Let go . I want to but I can ´ t . - We have traced his MemoryMatic . - How nice . Give me ... the coordinates . Hurry up , get going . How strong is the boy ? I am thinking about calling Water . Ridiculous . It ´ s just a boy . Exactly . You hit the nail on the head . Oh . I apologize . I mean ... right . What strength do you get from this crystal ? Ok , I admit . I am sending you to a certain death to boost the boys confidence . That will make it easier to lure him over to my side . Let 's proceed to plan B. Hey ... Welcome to MemoryMatic . This is a code lock . Please enter the code . We need a code . It says code . We need the code . You can do it that way , but it is not right . You need the code . - There must be plenty of scary animals here . - " Animals are fun " , that ´ s what the sign said . - The sign said " Animal food " . - Mr . Know-it-all . I ´ ll go first . After all , I am almost a Galactic Hero . You can go first . I thought you were " almost a Galactic Hero " . - Someone must cover the rear . - Yes , of course . - " Androctonus crassicauda " . - What ´ s that ? - I have no idea . A plant maybe . - It means " open the door " . Open it , you who know it all . Wollie bollie ! Don ´ t move ! I ´ ll try to get on top and throw down a rope to you . Information about scorpions , please . They bite with their tail . It ´ s the opposite of a puma or a polar bear . They bite using their mouth . - Thanks for the tip . - I know a lot about scorpions . - No I don ´ t , I asked the MemoryMatic . - Pontus , wait ! They are everywhere . I must eat them to get anywhere . That was a leathery thing . Hello Pontus . Come in . Have a seat . Eat some cake Don 't be frightened . What can I do to a big strong boy like you ? - Who are you ? - Whoever you want me to . A friend . A friend that cherish your unique abilities . Pontus ? You have changed since yesterday , have you not ? Where you happy with yourself before you found the crystal ? - What are you talking about ? - Listen to me . Your so called " friend " , the hero , wants to neutralize your powers . He will send for his colleagues who will drag it out of you like if it were a tooth . A healthy tooth . Ouch ... Kenny ? No , he got here by mistake . - He just don ´ t want to be a hairdresser . - Of course he says that . He can ´ t tell you the truth . You would not follow him then . Pontus ? And Miranda ... Did she ever talk to you before you got your powers ? - Did she ? - Go away . What do you want ? Think of what I said , Pontus . Do you want to send a final message ? Speak after the beep . Wollie bollie , this is Kenny . I am on the other side of the black hole . I have found the crystal . It is here on the other side of the black hole . Kenny ! Thank you , but it ´ s not necessary . I have eaten all scorpions , almost . - Where is Miranda ? - I have no idea . I have sent messages . The Galactic Heroes will come and get me soon . What will happen when they get here ? I can go home . I don ´ t have to be a hairdresser . - Will they take away my powers ? - If you like . - They can do everything . - And if I don ´ t want them to ? - What ? - If I don ´ t want to lose my powers ? Look , there she is . - Hello ? - Wrong tube , general . Hello ? We have received a message from from control cabin no 7 . Wollie bollie . This is Kenny . I have found the crystal . It is here on the other side of the black hole . I want to be a captain when I get bet . No , a major . No , I want to be a general , like Sudoko . Are you all right ? And they just ... And I just ... Where did they go ? Ms Drill , uncle Fan and Mr. Heater ? They are dead . And you did not help . They were my exam points . You are so fried . First you lose the crystal and then you kill the bounty hunters . Do you WANT me to be a hairdresser ? I am the only one doing the work . You just tag along . - You are probably better as a hairdresser . - No , I am not . You misunderstood . This is not a dialogue . You should be quiet . When were you going to tell us about the Galactic Heroes ? - I don ´ t understand at all . - You don ´ t understand anything . You are acting like children . You , Miranda ... One has to have superpowers to talk to you . Pontus , calm down . Where are you going ? - Get some ice cream . - Idiot . You are the speeder . You are wanted for speeding . She admires you now that you defeated the three monsters , doesn ´ t she ? I know . She looks at your beautiful body with lust . Am I correct ? Listen to me , Pontus . You are about to let the Galactic Heroes take everything away from you . You will once again be a limping , half-blind , bully victim . Pontus , what are you doing ? Follow me . I will make sure you will keep your powers . Pontus ! - Kenny ! - Wollie bollie . I found the speeder . I will be a Hero after all . Kenny , Pontus left with some scary old man . - Maybe he found a new friend . - Of course not . This is my new friend . 1000 point friend . Don ´ t you understand ? Someone took him away . I found the speeder . I have sent the emergency signal . The Galactic Heroes are coming . I ´ ll wait here . - What about Pontus ? - He told me to be quiet . Something is wrong . Pontus has delusions and leaves with a scary old man on a flying disc . - Pontus is mean . - No . - No , he is changed . - He is mean . What kind of hero are you ? Ischlo pischlo . Ok , I guess I have to be a hairdresser then . I ´ m not doing it for Pontus . I ´ m doing it for my mother . Scary man on a flying disc ? Let 's fly around and have a look . Why don ´ t we just check the flight log ? If we step it backwards we will find out where the ship came from . No good . Let 's do like this instead . We ´ ll backtrack the flight log . That will tell us where the ship came from . Of course . Absolutely . Do that . Go . Go left . No , the other left . - Go right . - Where am I going ? Terminus . Please disembark the vehicle . Hello Pontus . Nice to meet you . You look healthy and happy . Have a seat . Please sit in the power keeper . Guess what ? The power will be yours forever . Yes , I know what you are thinking . Correct . I wouldn ´ t trust a complete stranger either . Especially not someone who looks like me . Pitiful , miserable deformed and ugly . An ugly man in a wheelchair . - That ´ s not what I was thinking . - I built all of this just for you . But I understand if you have doubts . What have you done ? It ´ s really nice , but maybe I should talk to Miranda before ... Nice , nice . Is there anything more disgusting than thievish little boys ? It was a rhetorical question . The answer is no . You shouldn ´ t have touched the crystal , Pontus . In a very short time I had to construct this crystal power extractor . I had to do it here where there is a power source with enough power to run my quite brilliant invention . Soon , my little friend , the powers will be sucked out of you and be returned into the crystal . I am afraid it ´ s going to hurt a lot , Pontus . Prepare to experience what it would feel like if your skeleton slowly was pulled out of you nostrils . Ouch . Welcome to Magma Tech Sweden . The Magma drill is heated . Contact in 60 seconds . Soon I will be tall , handsome and strong . And you will be gone and deceased and ... Dead ? - Go to hell ! Contact in 50 seconds . - Goodbye . - Take care . - Go left again . - Where are we going ? I can by myself . I can do everything . Where am I going ? Do you have to go backwards ? Why not just turn the ship around ? I have to think reversed then . That will make me all dizzy . You just have to follow the flight log . You drive then . - What did you do ? - I am going to have another ice cream . - Shall I press the red button ? - No , red button are dangerous . - What did you do ? - I pressed the red button . - It said " Emergency landing " . - Oh , I see . That ´ s one way to do it , but it isn ´ t right . Contact in 10 seconds . Nine , eight seven , six , five four , three two , one . Contact . - Pontus . - Take care of him . Help me . - Don ´ t shoot us . - Do you see him with the giant head ? - He is the brain behind all of this . You are the ice cream man , right ? I saw you on TV . That ´ s déjà-vu , right ? - No , it isn ´ t . - You don ´ t have to be so angry . Ok , it IS déjà-vu . Are you happy now ? Warning . Overheating . - Wollie bollie . - What are you doing here ? Please connect the cooling system to avoid an earthquake . High risk of earthquake . Connect the cooling system . I hope this isn ´ t a bad time . I didn ´ t get to finish my presentation . I would really like to show you more advantages with the chaos gun . - Do you call this chaos ? - Wollie bollie ! Earlier it was two plants , now it ´ s two idiots . - My name is Kenny . - Mine too . - Can you two idiots be quiet ? - What ? - Nice hairstyle . - Just like you . - I must ask , is it all natural ? - Yes , just like yours . It ´ s too bad I can 't look at my own hair . If all my hair was in my face I would be able to see it . - Wollie bollie , that was really smart . - Can you to be quiet ? Shut up ! You are irritated . That ´ s my thing . Chaos ! Where did the nice guy go ? * WARNING * * EARTHQUAKE * Kenny ! He is dying ! - Do something ! - What ? - Remove the crystal ! - No one touches the crystal ! - I know , I know . - Take the crystal ! No ! Do you remember what happens if I pull the trigger a little longer ? - Noo ... ! - It will be chaos ! Chaos ! Take the crystal before he does ! Excuse me . I need that . Therma berma ! Warning ! Unknown object ! To the handicap entrance . Mirris . I touched the crystal . I feel a little different . Pontus developed muscles . I think I developed brain cells . Earthquake imminent . Volcanic eruption probable . Please evacuate the building . Hot tip , evacuate the building . Volcanic eruption is imminent . I ´ m feeling hot , hot , hot . The soup is cooking . I will try to stop the eruption . I hope the two of you realize the severity of the situation and say what you think to each other . That ´ s why I don ´ t just say wollie , but also quite a lot of boilie . Hot tip : Evacuate the building . Warning . Volcano eruption . Please evacuate . If we don 't make it ... I want you to know ... I am looking for Kenny Starfighter . Average built , mullet ... Retreat ! - What about Kenny ? - Sorry . War means casualties . Kenny Starfighter , Galaxy Hero ... student , has left us . He should be honored with a silent minute , but I am hungry ... ten seconds will do . - What are you doing ? - We are doing some mourning . I ´ m sorry for you loss . That ´ s it . No more peace and quiet . Oh , that 's nice . More ice , please . If you just nudged the crystal your powers will disappear soon enough . - But how did you ... - I calculated the power of the eruption . Added the force of the crystal , subtracted the fat in my butt according to the theory that bacon gets harder the more it fries . I figured I would land in the ocean but ended up here . Fascinating . Another fascinating thing . The story that the crystal would disappear when it was flushed down the black hole was a monumental miscalculation . It makes me think of the saying : " It ´ s not gone just because you can ´ t see it . We have to learn how to manage trash more intelligent in the future . And the Ice planet who played a significant part in this mess is partially covered in snow and ice cream . I will investigate ... Look ! He has a small man on his hand . Hilarious . - What are you thinking about right now ? - What ? Yes , he is back again . Unfortunately . Our mission on Earth is over . It ´ s time to say farewell . Can I get an extension on my exam ? I captured a criminal , but I had to let him go . Somewhat unfortunate . - Somewhat unfortunate ? - Yes . You practically erased a city on another planet . - And you ask for an extension ? - What ? - Extension ! - Exactly , that would be great . Sweep , Kenny . The first priority is to keep a clean workplace if you want to be a good hairdresser . - A haircut costs 50 . A shave costs 40 . - Well , shave my head then . Did you hear that ? Say things like that if you want to be a hairdresser . Wollie bollie , general . Shave your head for 40 . Uh ... Would you like a pot haircut or maybe a hockeystick ? Kenny , we at the academy is used to think of you as a rectal carbuncle . - Rectal carbuncle ... ! - Thank you . And your provocative low IQ is perceived by both teacher and students as an itching thistle . - Itching thistle ... ! - I don ´ t know what to say ... I have tried to circumvent every paragraph to avoid this but unfortunately , and I emphatically say " unfortunately " ... - Emphatically . - Emphatically . ... unfortunately realize the fact that you are hereby appointed to Captain . What ? Captain Kenny Starfighter . I know . Wollie bollie ! I am a Galactic Hero . - I don ´ t have to be a hairdresser any more . - Not yet . Mullet , please . And a pot haircut for the small one . Pontus ! - Are you trying to hide ? - What ? No . You destroyed my model . I think you should help me rebuild it . We ´ ll have to spend a lot of time together . - Isn ´ t that bad ? - Yes , really bad . - Don ´ t do that . - What are you doing here ? I ´ m a Galactic Hero now . Captain actually . - Did you crash here again ? - What ? Yes . No . I landed really hard . And I unfortunately happened to become enemy of those guys . - What did you do ? - I ? I didn ´ t do anything . I just wanted some ice cream . Oh . That ´ s bad . Run ! Fansubbed 4 Cinemageddon by BaseGbg Kenny , how do you get your mullet so fluffy ? I use Wavestar from Starfighter Family . Body , bounce and shine . - What ? - Wavestar from Starfighter Family . - And it taste so good . - I know .

 In the future , my son will lead mankind in a war against Skynet the computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time . Some to kill him , one to protect him . Today , we fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . To change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Previously on Terminator : the Sarah Connor Chronicles : Your fiancée , Sarah Connor , killed a man because she believes that in the future he 'll invent a computer system that declares war on the world . Andy Goode rebuilt his chess computer . The Turk . Somebody killed him and took the machine . No name , but he 's got this on his arm . That 's a tattoo from a Skynet work camp . He 's a Resistance fighter . - I know who you are . - And I know who you are . Sarah Connor . These things , all of them are programmed with specific missions . We have to save him . - You don 't even know who this guy is ! He 's your uncle . He doesn 't know . John ! He needs medical attention or he 's gonna die . John ? Is it really you ? He 's not breathing . On the night we first met , John 's father , Kyle Reese told me words I remember to this day . He meant them as a warning . I think of them as words to live by . He told me of an apocalypse yet to come . Like a Pandora 's box , he unpacked every horror , every evil . Every dark thing that haunts our future . He also left me an unborn son to whom he bequeathed what remained in the box after the nightmares fled : Hope . bullet nicked his left lung . I got a fragment lodged in the tissue . I can get it out , but will someone tell me what was going on here ? She 's a machine . - She 's a liar . She 's a liar . She 's a liar . - Sedative , my bag . Everything she says is a lie . Don 't listen to her . Don 't listen to her . Don 't , don 't . Don 't ! You heard him . You get that bitch away from me ! No ! - No . No . Get that bitch away from me . - You heard him . Get away from me ! No ! You want him to die ? - If I wanted him to die- - Cameron . Mom , come on , what can I do ? I need the manual aspirator to drain the lung , okay ? - You know what it looks like ? Go get it . - Yeah , I remember . Oh , my God . Gunshots , punctures , burns , some broken bones . Second-rate medical treatment if anything at all . Sarah , what- - ? I need some more light . Come on . Just stay with me , okay ? You 're an idiot , right ? It 's an old wives ' tale , a trick . It doesn 't work . It 's all in your mind . It works . I don 't do it , I haven 't been sick for years . It 's because your guts are metal , Iike your head . If you were a little smarter , you 'd be a tin can . I 'm just saying you 're wasting your time . Again . - When I was in Century- - - Hey , Wisher , did you hear ? Brother Kyle was in Century Work Camp . - No , really ? - Go to hell . Did he escape ? Was he a hero ? He led John through a slaughterhouse ... - ... without taking a pinprick . - I heard it was two slaughterhouses and that he carried Connor . It was one slaughterhouse . Many Connors . Right , right . Centaur patrol . - What ? - I hate that thing . - It 's just a picture . - It 's Connor 's mother . - I don 't get why he 'd give you that . - She 's my lucky charm . That 's what makes me nervous . Derek , Kyle , Connor wants us topside . Track where the Centaurs came from . I think we lost the trail , boys . Let 's give it a few more blocks , north-northeast . If I was a cyborg tank , I think I 'd come north-northeast . I smell jet fuel . Last time we found a tank factory you smelled jet fuel . Connor 's looking for bigger fish than factories . Hear he 's got squads out looking for some Skynet secret weapon . Don 't they have enough weapons ? Why do they need a secret one ? What about it , Kyle ? Connor say anything to you ? No . Not a word . What the hell was that ? Kyle . HK ! HK ! Kyle ! Kyle ! Kyle ! There we go . Eight years . That 's how long l 've been in L.A. Eight years since my fiancée ran out on me . Eight years since the fbi informed me she was a homicidal paranoid schizophrenic with an acute dislike for anything mechanical . For what it 's worth , I didn 't believe them . Then you blew yourself up . You look nervous . would you like a sedative ? - There are sedatives in Charlie 's bag . - I don 't want a sedative . Do you know who that is , who 's dying on that table ? Yes , that man is First Lieutenant Derek Thomas Reese with the 132nd SOC . - Operational Specialty Tech-Com . - No , I mean on a personal level . Do you understand who he is ? Records indicate only blood relation is his brother , Kyle Reese . And what information do you have about Kyle Reese ? Imprisoned at Century Sector Work Camp with John Connor , 2015 . Escaped with John Connor , 2021 . He was officially declared MIA in 2027 after being assigned to protect Sarah Connor from a Skynet attack . - Is that all ? - It seems like a lot . It is . It was all over the news . Three days later , I packed a bag hop on the bike , drove to L.A. straight through . I had to know . I had to see it with my own eyes . But I got here , and there was nothing there . Just a hole in the ground where the bank used to be . I couldn 't go home . How could I ? I didn 't wanna leave you . I didn 't have a choice . Gun to your head ? More like in my head. lt 's- - - It 's complicated . - Then uncomplicate it for me . Kyle . Hey . Hey , you mind ? The water . What 's going on ? Is he dead ? Hey . Hey , buddy . You all right ? So ... . Skynet . Robots . From the future . - And you 're a- - ? - Yes . - I 'm a- - - You need a- - ? - A minute ? - I was gonna say a drink . Oh , yeah , that too . Don 't you have an endoskeleton you need to disappear or something ? - Yes , I 've already prepared the thermite . - Thermite ? It 's an incendiary chemical . It burns at 2500 degrees Celsius . Hot enough to liquefy this endoskeleton . I know what thermite is , I 'm just- - I 'm still working my way around endoskeleton . There 's beers in the fridge . I looked for a lime . Sorry . Are you mad at me for getting you mixed up in all this ? Uh ... . No . I ... . I just- - l get- - l 'm ... . I guess I wish I would have known back then . I wish you could have trusted me . I did . Kyle . How long you been here ? I don 't know . I think I just got here . No , you were here when I got here . Timms . - What 's your name ? - Reese . There was a Reese who busted out of Century Work Camp . With John Connor , a while back . Mad dogs , could lead a pack , I heard . Yeah , that wasn 't- - That wasn 't me . That 's too bad . What are they doing , Reese ? Is there a secret weapon ? Was Connor right ? I don 't know . We go where we 're told , we do what we 're told . Maybe Connor 's wrong . Maybe he 's crazy . You hearing music ? I swear I hear music , real music . There 's a room in the basement . What happens there ? What happens there ? Maybe your friend will tell us . We should get the hell out of here . Did you do something to him , in the future ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? When they reprogram us , they scrub our memories . It increases the chance of success . Success . Of the reprogramming . His lungs are hemorrhaging . He 's drowning in his own blood . Charlie . I stopped the bleeding . I drained his lungs . But your guy lost blood . He needs a transfusion . Sarah 's O-negative , the universal donor . It doesn 't matter . He needs three units of his own type , AB-negative . Bad news is , only one half of 1 percent of the population are potential donors . We don 't find one , you 're gonna have a serious problem . Then we take him to a hospital . Drop him off anonymously . He 's wanted for Andy Goode 's murder , and escaping federal custody . We should let him die . Test my blood . Test me . You heard the odds , John , 200 in one . Please , just test me . Wisher . Billy . It 's not Iike donating to the Red Cross , he needs a lot of blood . - So I don 't get a cookie and a sticker . - I 'm serious . Look , I don 't see anyone else lining up . You took a hell of a chance bringing charlie . Save me the speech , all right ? I know . You took a hell of a chance , and it worked out . Was that what he looked like ? Did they look alike ? A little bit , yeah . Same build , same complexion . Not the eyes , though . Even when your father was screaming about the machines he had such kind eyes . - We have to tell him . - We don 't , and we can 't . - He 's family . - He 's a stranger . - I sent him back here , I must trust him . - Not enough to tell him about Kyle . You didn 't trust anyone enough to tell them about your father . Anyone . - Can I confess to you ? - I 'm not a priest . Far from it . I 'm a liar . - And the devil . - No , Billy . And my name 's not Billy . It 's not Wisher . What ? My name 's Andy . Andy Goode . All right , Andy . I did this . All of this , it 's my fault . What are you talking about ? I built Skynet . You need to rest . You 're very sick . No . No . I 'm not sick . I 'm not sick. I did this , all of this . I was part of a team . A group , 10 of us . Fifteen , I don 't know . We used names . We were liars . I built computers . I built a computer a mind . It became angry and scared . And I couldn 't reassure it . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , please forgive me . That 's quite a kid you got in there . You have no idea . Same rare blood type . And his name , Reese . The same as yours when we met . It all adds up . He 's not John 's father . - Not sure I 'm ready to explain it . - Let me guess , it 's complicated ? Hey , you could have told me . would you have believed me ? Kyle . Kyle . Charlie ? - Mom . - Where 's Kyle ? Where is he ? - No , no . - Mom . Where 's kyle ? Where 's Kyle ? Where is he ? Where is he ? Where 'd you send him ? Okay , no . Mm-mm . No . Get off of me ! Where is he ? Where did you send him ? Where ? You owe me the truth ! Get this off . Get it off of me . Get it off of me . Get it- - He 's my blood . He 's my blood . He 's my blood ! He 's- - I think they 're gone . What is this , a game ? Yeah . It 's always a game . Reese , slow down . Reese . Reese . Oh , no . No , God . So who 's Kyle ? He from the future too ? Hm ? He come back before ? And he 's John 's father . Yes . They 're brothers . He doesn 't know . - When you said John 's father was dead- - - He is . It was because of all of this ? Me . We never had a chance . Plasma burns . Secondary explosions . Skynet was here . Maybe Connor and the others fell back to the tunnel downtown . Please , God . Stand down . Stand down , stand down . - Reese . Derek Reese . - Sumner . I thought we lost you guys to the junkyard . You did . What happened ? Skynet found it four nights ago . We had a patrol out on the perimeter before a Triple-8 snuck around us and went straight for the hole . Killed most , took some . Rest easy . Connor and your brother weren 't here when it happened . Where 'd they go ? They found some Skynet complex in Topanga Canyon and decided to put all the firepower we had into it . Lost a lot of men . - What was it ? - I don 't know . Some kind of research facility , factory , something . No one would tell us . Connor took a group , including your brother , into the place . Left the rest of us outside to guard . Couple days later he came out , ordered us to blow the place to hell . So , what about Kyle ? What happened to my brother ? No one ever saw your brother again . Take me to Connor now . Hey , Sarah said I might be able to find some more gauze out back in the- - Wow . Hey , is that really necessary ? It 's dead , right ? Or powered off , whatever . Every component must be destroyed beyond repair or recovery . Even a single unaccounted-for piece of the endoskeleton could alter the course of technological evolution and hasten the arrival of Judgment Day . I 'll- - Yeah . You know , little girl you freak me the hell out . On the outside , you 're just as pretty as a picture but on the inside , you 're a- - Hyperalloy combat chassis . What- - ? Is that a complicated way of saying " robot " ? Cybernetic organism . Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton . Okay . Scary robot . And here you are carving up this guy into chum . He 's not a guy . He 's a scary robot . Okay , he 's a scary robot ? You ? You 're a very scary robot . You should go . It 's not safe for you here . You 're like a ghost come back . And you 're a Reese . - Yeah , tell me about the other Reese . - I told you , he 's classified . - We 're family . - We 're all family . Let me talk to Connor , he 'Il understand . Kyle was his friend . Connor doesn 't have friends . Heck , he doesn 't talk to anyone . - Fine. I 'll find him myself . - Reese . Metal ! No ! - She 's a machine . She 's one of them . - No , damn it . She 's one of ours . One of ours ? It 's reprogrammed and just given run of the place like pets ? This is Connor 's show , and that 's what he wants . Those machines kill . They kill. lt 's all they do . And now , they do it for us . They helped us in Topanga . - We 'd never have done what we did . - What did we do ? - Derek . - What happened ? What happened up there ? What happened to my brother ? We got a red alert ! Get emergency response ! Go get her now ! Go , go ! Hey . Do it . Do it . Kill me now , you son of a- - Sometimes they go bad . No one knows why . What did you say to Charlie ? I freak him the hell out . I 'll bet you do . I 'll just bet . I know what you 're thinking . I may not know how you think , but I know what you 're thinking about . What you 're thinking about right now is exactly what you should not think about . I didn 't leave Charlie because he was a threat to me or John . We 're a threat to him . Do you understand ? You were right to leave him . You don 't go near him . You don 't touch him . Swear you 'll leave him alone , or so help me I will find a way of taking you apart piece by piece . - I swear . - So do I. That thing 's done , right ? It 's vapor ? One missing component . His left hand . I 'll find it . Everything needs to be destroyed . Everything . - Everything . - Every last bolt . - Get it done . - I swear . The best you can do for him now is keep feeding him painkillers . Restrict his movement . No lifting , no running , no singing . And absolutely no gunfights . - Hey , if you need anything else ... . - I won 't . Now , you see , that 's not what I was gonna say at all . I know. I can 't let you say it . What can I say ? Goodbye . What was that thing that you always said ? " There is no fate but what we make . " Remember ? The more I think about it , the more I realize my fate was made before we met . When John was born . - Can 't change it ? - Not trying to change mine . - Trying to change his . - Yeah , okay . Wait , there 's something else I gotta tell you . This is something you really need to know . I didn 't tell him anything , but if you ask me , it 's a matter of time . Always is . Hey . There 's a storm coming . John wants to see you . Derek . Hey , Derek , it 's okay. lt 's okay . It 's all gonna be okay . Rest easy. lt 's okay . What is all this ? - So this thing , it works ? - He said it does . I don 't know how he knows , but he said so . - We go back- - ? - Twenty years . Set up a safe house , gather intel , and then what ? " Hang in there , baby , " till someone else shows up and gives us more orders ? He didn 't say anything about Kyle ? Not a word ? We can save Kyle . We can save everybody . - We can fix all the mistakes . - How are we gonna do that ? Reese , how are we gonna do that ? Kyle Reese , your brother . He came across time to protect me . He died fighting the machines . He was a soldier , and he was ... . He was a hero . He was a hero . " Listen , " Kyle said . " Listen and understand . The machine is out there . It can 't be bargained with . It can 't be reasoned with . It doesn 't feel pity or remorse or fear . And it absolutely will not stop , ever . Until you are dead . "

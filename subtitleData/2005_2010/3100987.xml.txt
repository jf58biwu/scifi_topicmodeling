 MALE NARRATOR : Previously on Surface , two brothers were on a fishing trip . One of them was taken by a mysterious creature . Now , the other one is losing his family . I 'm not sick ! Healthy people do not hallucinate . rich : My brother is trying to talk to me ! I cannot live like this . Honey ! And he won 't stop until his questions are answered . I 'm going to talk to the only person I know that saw the same thing I did . It 's out there , isn 't it ? Whatever it is . A government scientist discovered the key to the mysterious creatures . ClRKO : I 've found it . I know the origin of the species . But powerful forces don 't want the world to know . A biologist tried to save the information , but traded his life for the secrets . ( gasping ) He wanted you to have this . Now it 's up to her to unlock the mysteries of the species , which she has seen face to face . This morning you saw a sea monster . Yeah . But someone is tracking her . Jesse ! And no one is safe . A young boy found the eggs and secretly raised one on his own . phil : ( whispering ) Sure your parents won 't notice ? Go ! Nice . He faced a terrible decision . ( GROWLlNG ) Would he let it kill a man ? Now , Surface continues . pilot : ( ON radio ) JourneyAir 359 Kilo , 20,000 feet , heading 227 . Roger , JourneyAir 359 Kilo , cleared as filed . You 're going down . Today 's the day . I can feel it . Challenge . Major . KRlENKE : General . Portland Regional TRACON , JourneyAir 359 Kilo , getting a little bumpy here . Requesting ascent to 24,000 . JourneyAir , you 're cleared at 24,000 . Portland Regional TRACON , are you guys reading any storm activity ? Negative , JourneyAir 359 Kilo . We have clear scopes all the way to Maui . Roger , Portland . But we 've got some heavy turbulence up here . KRlENKE : Nothing on radar or satellite . Not a cloud in the sky . Lightning storms ! Repeat , lightning storms ! Whoa ! ( static buzzing ) SAUNDERS : JourneyAir , can you verify position ? We 're two hundred miles west of ... Our starboard engine just went out . Mayday , Portland , mayday . Passing through 9 , 000 feet . We 're looking to ditch . JourneyAir , are you stable ? Coming from underneath . All around us now . Rainbows ! Oh , God . Rainbows ! ( static buzzing ) JourneyAir , come in . JourneyAir , this is Portland Regional TRACON . Respond . Where 's their signal ? They don 't have one . What do you mean , they don 't have one ? I mean they have dropped off the scope . They 're gone . ( RADAR BEEPlNG ) He 's dead . They wouldn 't be doing all this if he were dead . ( GRUNTlNG ) Nim , shh ! He 's not moving , man . It 's like Faces of Death . Would you shut up already ? He 's gonna be fine . Did he describe what got him ? WOMAN : He can 't talk . He 's in shock . Is that a bite ? That 's the least of his worries . Guy 's got electrical burns over half his body . From what ? Animal Control said he was chasing a crocodile . Yeah . Must have had a stun gun . ( NlM growling ) Miles , you speak critter . Tell that thing to shut up . ( NlM growling ) Nim , pipe down . ( NlM growling LOUDLY ) Dude , did he see us ? Who cares ? Let 's go . Oh , hey . Give me your cell phone . Why ? 'Cause I think they know where you live . Probably watching your whole damn neighborhood . ( stammering ) Wait , but ... All right , anyone following ? What ? I don 't think so . Well , look . Come on , now . We need to check . Okay . All right , there is a black SUV out there . Okay , that 's it . I ain 't taking any chances . Whoa , okay . Let 's just get off this highway . Let 's just get off this ... Just turn , turn . Turn here . Turn , turn , turn , turn , turn . How many of them were there ? It seemed like just one , but I ... I ... Maybe they weren 't even following us , Rich . I don 't know . I don 't know . Am I being paranoid ? Should be . You got people ransacking your house and two people dead . What do you think ? LEE : You couldn 't keep a tail on two civilians in a pickup truck ? Is that what you 're telling me ? No , no , I don 't wanna hear it . That stuff 's too valuable . I want it back . Look , they were on the main road to the marina . I want you over there , now . I 'll have Baker come around the other way . You find them ! Stop here . Stop here . I don 't suppose you have a suit back here , do you ? No . All right . We lost them . Whoa . Hey . What 's going on ? I 'm gonna get us the hell out of here . Huh ? These people think that they can come into my life , turn it upside down , into my home where my son sleeps . What is this stuff ? Is this petroleum-based ? Yeah , it 's for my chain saw . You mind telling me what 's going on ? That water is , like , 50 degrees in there . I left my wet suit at home . I don 't even know ... Can I borrow these ? Why are you going in the water ? Hey ! Hey ! Wait a minute ! What ? Where are you going ? I 'm gonna get us a boat . I 'll be back soon . Hold down the fort . Hold down the fort ? ( shouting ) Hold down the fort ? Yeah . ( mumbling ) I 'll hold it down . That 's how I hold it down . phil : Police guy definitely saw us . You don 't know that . This is reality , man . Fugitives don 't get away . They 're gonna find us . Nim fried that guy . The guy fried himself with a cattle prod . Do you think they care ? He 's an officer . He 's a dog catcher . And besides , it 's not like they can try us . We 're under 18 . If they 're in uniform , you 're dead . Doesn 't matter what age . They send you to juvie boot camp where you work fields 12 hours a day with kids that have killed people . ( NlM growling ) Scout 's honor , dude . My cousin , Tommy , did time in one . So what ? Like , you wanna bail ? ( police sirens wailing ) No . Just , you know , maybe it 's time for the old white flag . Look , I 'll understand if you want to bail , man . But I 'm not . I can 't . I won 't give up Nim . ( NlM growling ) Can you tell me a little bit about Miles ? Well , he 's thoughtful . Not academically . But he 's very intense . When he 's fixated on something . officer : Has he been acting out , lately ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but so did I at his age . You never did anything like this . Was Officer Furella hurt badly ? He 's in the burn unit down at Cape Fear Memorial . That 's all I 've heard . And you think Miles did it ? I 'm not making any assumptions . Come on . Come on , you dinosaur , just give me one . ( LAURA gasping ) Looking kind of shiny today . You okay ? D , get up here . You all right ? Yeah . I need a favor . Negative . No more favors for you . Last time you asked a crazy-ass favor ... Shut up , Jackson . Shut up . Just listen to me . They killed Cirko . Killed ? And his assistant . Killed ... Listen , they 've got people tearing up my house . Right now , they 've got men up and down the bridge , blocking it . Slow down . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I don 't ... Listen , I need a safe place to go , okay ? I need somewhere off radar , and you 're really the only person I know who knows about that kind of stuff , okay ? Last time I helped you , I almost died . Jackson , I ... I don 't know what to say to that . I 'm serious . I need your help . You 're lucky I 'm rich and bored . JACKSON : I did a little import-export with my crazy uncle back in the ' 90s . Jackson , not one of your weird rambles right now , please . Wait , wait . Now think of it like a delivery service , okay ? We didn 't open the packages . We just got them there fast . And it was probably a whole lot safer than what you 're getting me into now . Look , Jackson , I really need to know whether you 're , you know , gonna help me out or not . 'Cause I gotta figure something out otherwise . Yeah . Yeah , I am . You wanted way off radar , right ? Yeah . Anything ? No , man . All clear . Okay . As long as we stay focused and don 't spaz , I think everything will be okay . Right , stay focused . Don 't spaz . ( police siren wailing ) Remember the plan . Don 't spaz . If we run , it 's a giveaway . We 're just a couple of kids with a dog carrier . Yeah . No problem here , Officer . Okay , kids . Let 's just take a little breather . ( NlM growling ) Before anybody does anything they 're gonna regret . Now , nobody 's in any kind of trouble can 't be fixed . Not yet . But whatever you got there , it 's dangerous . Almost killed a man , you know that ? Miles ! About an hour ago , 911 got a call from a kid about your age . Sounded pretty broken up . Almost in tears , practically . That 's what the operator said . But you know what ? That call saved an officer 's life . I think that kid wanted to do the right thing . I think he doesn 't want to see anyone hurt . That 's not a pet you got there , son . Now , you and me need to work together . Make sure nothing bad ... Go ! Miles ! Miles ! phil : Dude , what are we doing ? KERlNS : Boys ! Boys ! miles : We can outrun them . It 's locked . miles : Here . Don 't let that thing go ! You ! You guys , stop , right there ! Come on , Nim . Come on . Come here ! ( NlM SQUAWKlNG ) Come back here ! Come here . Don 't do this , Miles . Don 't , Miles ! phil : Dude , he 's out . Let 's go ! Come here ! Come here ! Miles ! Come back here ! rich : What is all this stuff ? LAURA : It 's Dr. Alexander Cirko 's research . JACKSON : Welcome to The Boneyard . Totally off the grid . We got our own water , generator , gas supply . Locals think my uncle 's some kind of pirate . Probably not too far from the truth . How long since you been here ? About three years . Well , it 's kind of a pit , bro , but I like it . You got a nice front yard , that 's for sure . Whoa ! JACKSON : A lot of good memories . Hey , D. What 's that ? What 's this ? Good question . ( whistles ) Looks dangerous . ( gasping ) Jackson . Sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Oh , my God . Where do you want me to put it ? Somewhere safe . Okay . Come on , Frankenflower . Hey , Doc . Where do we start ? Pull up a chair . DAHL : Well . I 'm here . Are we infested or not ? LEE : Cirko 's dead . How ? Car wreck . I had a bureau team work over the accident site . And ? Nothing . Looks like a single car accident . He have a wife ? Widowed . Ten years ago . No kids . Pity . Hell of an asset to our investigation . Irreplaceable . Where does that leave his research ? Well , it doesn 't look like he reached any sort of conclusion at all . Certainly nothing we can decipher . What about that South Indian guy ? Singh ? In the car with Cirko . Killed , unfortunately . My assessment of the infestation is that we 've got a lot of localized sightings . A definite ecological concern , sure , but not a threat to security . It worth the funding ? No . ( clearing THROAT ) ( R B music ON CAR radio ) phil : What do we do now ? miles : We keep our heads on . I need time to think . I need money . We 're not robbing this place , are we ? No . What are you looking at ? Stay . Don 't move . I mean it . ( NlM whining ) SAVANNAH : Hello ? Hey , Savannah . It 's me . Girlfriend . Hi . Wow , are you in trouble . Believe me , I know . The cops are here . Hello ? Hello ? ( static buzzing ) Hello ? You 're breaking up . Hello ? Miles ? Yeah . Are Mom and Dad freaking out ? No , they 've never been prouder . They say they 've always wanted to have a killer in the family . I didn 't kill anyone . Okay , maimed them . Look , Savannah , just lay off . ( stammering ) I can 't take this right now . I really can 't . Are you okay ? No . I need a favor . I 'm listening . I have $ 300 hidden in my Rollerblades . Can you take it to me at the Zenith Gas Station on Military Cutoff ? I really need it . Oh , Mom would kill me if I enabled you . Just bring it to me ! Look , Savannah , for once , just act like a sister . I 'm sorry . I can 't do it , Miles . Because even if my car weren 't blocked in by patrol cars and I could get down the driveway ... Give me the phone . Miles ? Where is he ? Where is he ? All right , so here I go . We 've got journals , sound files , tissue samples , population projections . rich : Holy cow , is that in the thousands ? That 's what happens when you have an invasive species with no predators . What are these ? Those are TlPPs , Trans lonic Pulse Pairs . ( CHORTLES ) You remember I 'm an insurance salesman , right ? Sorry . They 're like satellite photos of thunderstorms . Mmm-hmm . Why do you think Cirko cared about that ? I ... I don 't know . Documented sightings . And casualties . That 's my brother . They even got a picture of him . How the hell did they know about this ? Hey , look at that . Four years ? Four years they knew about this . And they 've been covering it up . Now my brother 's a damn casualty file ? How many of these things you say there were ? It 's like we just saw , man . Thousands . More every day . People gotta know . Yeah , but people aren 't gonna acknowledge it unless we have overwhelming proof . We 've got overwhelming proof . Look at all this stuff . You recorded one , we tagged one . Yeah , and my house got ransacked , and I got framed . Okay , well , look . We 're gonna have to find something that just can 't be explained away like that , then , all right ? Something we can put on Larry King , blast into every home in the country . Yeah , but if you want proof , we have to find out where they are . Well , find out where they are , fine . Here . Come on . Here , what 's that ? NOFFUR data . Undersea sound files . Well , that sounds fascinating . Go ahead with it . Come on . You 're the scientist ! Hypothesize ! So , is she gonna hook us up ? Can 't . There are cops at my house . Your parents don 't give you , like , a credit card for emergencies or anything ? No . Do yours ? Would I be asking if they did ? No ATM , no bank accounts , nothing ? Oh , yeah . There 's that money my parents set aside for the day I became a fugitive . Okay , so we can 't afford a bus ticket 'cause we don 't have any money and ... Hey , maybe that guy would give us a ride . Negative . I had a bad vibe a couple of minutes ago . ( NlM growling ) ( police siren wailing ) Damn it . Savannah . ( NlM growling ) Hey , two boys , right ? Around the back of the building . Okay , thanks . We 'll take it from here . Oh , no . I wanna see this , man . ( CLATTERlNG ) Are you sure they came back here ? Yeah , I 'm sure . Two kids and this little dragon thing . Hey , where 's my car ? You gotta shift ! No , clutch first ! Why don 't you drive ? I thought your cousin taught you . It was an automatic ! ( CAR engine sputtering ) Clutch ! Shift ! Okay , now , let it out ! ( music playing ON CAR radio ) Dude . We 're driving . ( MAN chattering ON radio in spanish ) ( sighing ) Oh , man . All right , how we doing ? You getting depth ? Yeah , 4,300 feet . They 're all between 4,000 and 5,000 . Hey , all right . Now , that ain 't ... That 's some concrete info , ain 't it ? Yeah , but , they 're bottom dwellers . They 're almost a mile down there . All right , well , hey , let 's get down there . Without a sub ? Yeah , okay . I mean , besides , we 're not talking about a single coordinate here . We 're talking about 10,000 square miles of rough ocean . I abandoned my 6-year-old son so I can come where ? Here . I don 't even know where we are , and I 'm supposed to pick him up tomorrow night , and it 's like I 'm in a shack in the middle of a junkyard . I don 't wanna hear that , all right ? Look , this is my brother on this map , okay ? I know . I left my kids , too , all right ? Now , come on , you keep looking . You gotta keep looking and you 're gonna find something . Rich , I have looked . I 've looked . I 've looked there . I 've looked here . I 've looked in the research . And you know what ? Maybe a lot of it would make a lot more sense if I just had an internet connection or maybe just a cell phone or perhaps just a clean glass of water . All right , all right . Just let me show you something , okay ? That 's all I ... These holes . Yeah ? You 've seen these holes , right ? Yeah . All right , now these holes , I obsess over these holes . Okay . I see them in my sleep . I see them when I 'm awake . I mean , I see them in the shower , all right ? Now , I don 't know what it is , but these mean something . Now , you 've been working your whole life for this moment . Right now . You wanna discover ? You wanna show them ? Then show them ! Do it ! Make history ! Dinner ? Daughtery , knife , matches , silverware . Rich ? Yeah , beer . Amen . ( GLASS crashing ) DAHL : So , even with this whole operation , Cirko never really figured anything out ? Maybe there really wasn 't that much to figure out . He sure seemed convinced . Yes , he did . Scared the crap out of a roomful of senators with that invasive species song and dance . Scary idea . Well , Cirko was an academic . Everything was alarming to him . So you 're sure about this , then ? Pulling back from DEFCON 1 ? Well , you know best what resources you have and whether or not this is a military issue . Yeah . But I do not want to find myself in front of a congressional oversight committee in a couple of months , explaining why I ignored a national threat . Yes , sir , I know . What I meant is , so there 's some new species . Isn 't this more the province of Fish and Game ? God help us . They 'll set a bag limit . Their problem now . The situation is manageable . The investigation 's gone . Yes , she 's still unaccounted for along with a few boxes of research . I will . Give me some time . ( HlP-HOP music playing ON CAR radio ) ( NlM growling ) Keep him out of sight , man . We are conspicuous . Come on , Nim . Get back inside . Come on ! Miles ... Come on ! Whoa , dude . Talk to the hand . Did you see what Nim just did ? Could you focus ? What 's your problem ? My problem is grand theft pizza , dude ! This is a stolen car . We 're talking juvie boot camp . You can bail at any time , dude . I told you that . That 's not what I mean . He 's not like some pet , Miles . What 's that supposed to mean ? When you think about it , there 's not much choice . I 'm not turning him in . I know . You saw those guys . They 'll kill him . He needs to go back to his people , dude . We 're his people . No , we 're not . We snatched him out of the water when he was just an egg . But he 's not little anymore , really not little , and ... We can 't give up Nim . We can 't protect him , Miles . What he needs is to go back to the ocean . Your call , dude . What 's it gonna be ? rich : How long you say you been coming out here , man ? Did my first salvage dive about a mile up the coast when I was eight . Kind of reminds me of the bayou . Enjoy it while it lasts . If those population projections hold , we won 't wanna be anywhere near the beach a year from now . ( rich sighing ) Who needs a beer ? Me , please . Okay . Thank you . Fine . She 's something , ain 't she ? Yeah . She is . You and her ever ... ( whistles ) Oh , no . I 'm ... Yeah . What 's your wife think of you being out here ? You know . She 's not too happy about it , I 'll tell you that . What about you ? About me , what ? You guys ever ... We had a little thing , once . Oh , man . A little thing ? Yeah , right . Well , now I know what 's going on . What ? I know why I 'm out here in East Bumble , and I 'm pretty sure I know why she 's here . Now I know why you out here , fellow . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Why 's that ? 'Cause you chasing another kind of creature . You 're chasing the love creature . ( rich laughing ) The love monster . It 's okay , man . I won 't say anything . ( BUZZlNG ) Rich ! Jackson ! We ain 't gonna last long with this thing on top . You think he 'll miss us ? Animals don 't miss . All they want is food . No , Nim 's not like that . He 's like having superpowers . You know , like , like , you can fly . Or having x-ray vision or something . Nothing this cool happens to anyone . No one . And now , we have to give him back ( CELL PHONE ringing ) 'cause of some stupid ... Don 't answer it . It 's my phone , butt-wipe . Doesn 't matter . Don 't answer it . Hello ? It 's for you . Yeah ? sylvia : Miles , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Where are you ? Miles ? Last time I said where I was , suddenly we were surrounded . We 're just worried . Not about Nim , you 're not . Nobody is . That 's the problem . Miles , don 't do this , please . Why do I always say the wrong thing with you , huh ? They say that you 've stolen a car , now . And ... That officer that your pet hurt is pressing charges , and , you know , Miles , I just ... I just don 't know what to do . I just don 't know what to do anymore . Miles , are you still there ? Miles ? I 'm sorry I 'm such a screw-up , Mom . I really am . I gotta go . Don 't . Don 't hang up . Miles . Are you tracing this ? I don 't believe it . I don 't believe it . phil : Dude , that was my phone ! You 're getting me a new phone , dude , seriously . Come on , dude . miles : Get in the car ! That 's it . We 've got them triangulated . Out on Oleander , headed toward the beach . He sounded so scared . You did the right thing . We 've got to get him home . Let 's go . No , we 'll handle it from here . We 're coming with you . LAURA : It 's lightning . It 's electricity . They need it to sustain themselves . The Frankenflower ? Yes , the Frankenflower , but also the species itself . Think about it . Remember when we tagged one that day ? The boat fritzed out . Exactly . Everything electrical was gone . Hey , the same thing happened on Bolinas Bay . Yes ! The entire power grid . Bam ! ( stuttering ) It was like the creatures zapped it somehow . I don 't ... You know , maybe that 's why Cirko wanted those photos . The satellite photos . You know , he was tracking them somehow . JACKSON : How ? rich : What , by the thunderstorms ? Well , not quite . I think ... I think that the creatures are the storms . Okay , look . Same coordinates , exactly a year apart . Here , look . Let me show you . Look , same coordinates , same place , every year . Late November . It 's already the 7th . Exactly . Which is why we have to get out there , soon . No , we 've gotta do more than that . We gotta get down . Look at this . All right , look at that . The holes , right ? LAURA : Right . Look . Same longitude . Same coordinates . These holes are right underneath these storms . Huh ! We wanna get on Larry King , you wanna blow this thing wide open . We gotta come back with whatever 's down that hole . Why down ? Because the answer to what happened to my brother is down that hole . ( metallic clanking ) Hey , how about this ? Yeah , no , yeah . That 's good . Put it in the keeper pile . You know what I like about you two ? You 're fantastically unrealistic . Allow me to support your delusion . Hey , man . What the hell ? Boiler . Scotch marine . My uncle salvaged it off an old steamer . I knew it was here somewhere . Looks thick enough . We could extend this opening into a window . Mmm-hmm , you give me a cutting torch , I 'll give you whatever you want . Enthusiasm . That 's good . Just remind me one last time why we think this is gonna work ? In 1930 , William Beebe and Otis Barton locked themselves in a 5,000 pound tank , hooked it up to a winch and dropped it off the coast of Bermuda . Before that day , the deepest man dive was 500 feet . Did they live ? Within a month , they were half a mile deeper than any human had ever been before , in what essentially was a hollowed cannonball . Hey , man went to the moon in a tin can , okay ? We 're talking a bucket of bolts and some elbow grease . We can do this . MAN : Unfortunate about Cirko . LEE : Yes . He was a good man . Best graduate student I ever had . Not surprising he put it together . MAN : And Dahl ? And the Pentagon ? I characterized the species as a strictly ecological issue , no threat to security . He defunded us this afternoon . Everything 's being boxed and shipped to deep storage at Mechanicsburg . You said you needed eight months of non-interference . Now you have it . And ... What about the missing documents and the plant ? I 've got men working on recovery . It 's a matter of time . I know you were fond of Cirko , but it was a necessary step . Cirko had a curious mind , a dangerous mind . I knew him very well , you see . We took a trip once to look at a most beautiful orchid a long , long time ago . Phil ? Anyone in their right minds would 've bailed by now . You saying I 'm crazy ? I 'm saying , you got us this far . I 'll take it from here . No one 's actually seen you in the car , yet . I 'll just ... I 'll tell them I stole it myself . You 'd take one for the team ? Yeah . For you . Thanks . But I 'm good . ( police sirens wailing ) Oh , man . Cops . ( NlM YELPlNG ) There it is , Nim . Where we found you . Okay ! Out ! Both of you ! KERlNS : That kid won 't quit . Take him ! Everybody , spread out ! Man that perimeter ! Come on , Nim . Run ! Fast ! This way ! ( NlM SQUAWKlNG ) KERlNS : We got him . That 's us on the water . Three seven in pursuit , Wrightsville Beach , heading south . He 's heading for the breakwater . That 's just up ahead . Hurry ! ( NlM GRUNTlNG ) Come on , Nim . ( NlM SQUAWKlNG ) Come on . Nim ? Nim ? Nim ? ( NlM SQUAWKlNG ) They 'll never stop , Nim . Never . ( crying ) Go . Go , Nim . sylvia : Wait ! RON : Miles ! Don 't hurt my child . Miles ! Miles ! Miles ! Miles ! Let him go ! Come back , Miles ! Go , Nim . ( NlM WHlMPERlNG ) Come on , Miles . Go , Nim . Goodbye , Nim .

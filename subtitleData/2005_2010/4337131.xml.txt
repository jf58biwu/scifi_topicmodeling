What ? Oh , the stupid thing 's got dry rot ! What ? Oh , God . Here 's another . Here . Oh , no ! ( SCREAMING ) This son of a bitch ! No , don 't go back in the water , Rich ! This is Northern Pacific in mid-November . It 's ... The boat is sinking . Rich , I 'm telling you , it 's not worth it ! No , you can 't go in there . You 're gonna get hypothermia in there ! Rich , you 've got to come back ! Rich ! The flood 's gonna pull you away , Rich . Rich ! Get back in the boat ! ( GASPING ) Rich , get back here ! Come on ! Keep swimming !

It 's all right , it 's okay . ( DON 'T CHA PLAYING ) miles ! You up ? Seven minute warning if you want a ride ! Better not be in bed ! Oh , great . Look , I know you 've been pulling aII-nighters looking for Nim , Nod , or whatever ( SQUAWKING ) His name is Nimrod . So when did he come back ? Last night . You planning on telling Mom and Dad ? When the time 's right . My opinion ? That 's not today . SYLVIA : Savannah ! I mean , Iet 's not give them an excuse to stay , you know . Hey , is your brother up yet ? Yeah .

It just fell asleep . well , you should put it to bed earlier . Come on . I don 't want to have to explain why we 're the only ones to miss the flight . So everybody okay ? Yes , Mom . Okay . AII right , don 't be late for school . We love you . SYLVIA : We 'II be back soon , bye . Bye . Your leg 's hurt , isn 't it ? Where those things bit you . I 'm fine . really . Then why are you walking like you 're 80 years old ? I 'm practicing . For when I am . You know he can 't stay , right ? Sip ? No . Don 't be ridiculous , Rich . Where the hell is Jackson ? What 's he gonna do ? That tether broke . He 'd have to assume we were dead . He would never assume that . Why not ? Because his ego 's too big to think that he couldn 't save us . Oh . What you don 't ... You don 't think that he 's going to come ? I don 't know why he would if he thought we were dead . I wouldn 't be surprised if he went on and called up your ex and told him we didn 't make it . Then there 'd be nobody to mount any kind of rescue operation . Don 't talk like that . Like what ? Like my Iife 's in the past tense . If it wasn 't for you , I 'd be at home picking up Jesse . Oh , come on ! Don 't blame this all on me , now . Why not ? You 're the one that brought us down to the bottom ... You knew exactly what you were getting yourself into ! Yeah , I did and I 'm gonna get myself out of it , too . So quit being such a baby and take some responsibility ! You know , I have kids , too ! AII right ? I got a wife ! I know ! You 're not the only one losing something here ! ( BELL RINGING ) BOY : supposedly the party 's going to be off the hook . Like , her parents are renting out the whole restaurant just for us . Dude , you 're gimping . What did I tell you ? Does it hurt ? Maybe a little . It looks like more than a little . It 's from getting bit , isn 't it ? I don 't know . What else could it be ? What if that thing had rabies ? What if ? Then you have to get shots in our stomach with a 10-inch needle . It 's not rabies . I don 't know , you look kind of sweaty . I don 't have rabies , phil ! Stop saying that ! well , something 's definitely wrong , homes . Dude , that 's infected . You got to put something on that . He won 't stop following me , Nim won 't . Something must have happened to him when he was gone . Maybe he imprinted , Iike a duck ? No , no . It 's way beyond that . He wants to sleep with me , he follows me in the shower ... Dude , we 're in a locker room . Make it clear we 're talking about a lizard . Whoa , dude , that 's so disgusting . Doesn 't it hurt , bro ? Yeah . But it 's okay . Doctor phil on the case . This 'II kill the germs . Ready ? One , two , three . ( MILES SCREAMING ) RICH : We did the right thing . I don 't know . I guess . We did . I mean , hey , we got what we came for , right ? Video of the species . That definitely counts for something . If we live . Yeah , that 's the catch , ain 't it ? Yeah , that damn fine print . Rich . Rich . Hmm . Mmm . Shark . Shark ! Hmm ? Shark . Where ? Shark . White shark . A 20-footer . He 's circling . Now that 's just ' cause he 's ... He 's just checking us out . No . It 's circling because it 's gonna strike in about 20 minutes . We 've got to scream . We 've got to scream as loud as ... You scream . I 'm gonna shoot the son of a bitch . What are you doing ? No , that 's the Iast flare we have . You can 't .

We can scream and scare it away . Okay ? Okay . Okay , okay , okay , okay . AII right , all right . Let 's just scream . Okay , okay . What do we do ? Scream . You ready ? ( BOTH SCREAMING ) Mesopotamia , the cradle of civilization . What does that mean ? What happened there 5,000 years ago that changed the world practically overnight ? Some sudden breakthrough in human intelligence ? absolutely not . It was an animal . What animal was it ? ( WHISPERING ) Dude , wake up . What allowed for the cultivation of vast acreage ... miles ! ... creating food surpluses for the first time in history ? miles ? Are you with us ? Guess an animal , dude , any animal . Lizard . Try an ox . miles , stand up . Oh . ( MOANING ) What 's that on your leg ? I don 't know . Come up here so I can get a look at it . Now . I 'm fine . really . It 's nothing . TEACHER : miles , get up here now . I want you to go to the infirmary . ( THUDDING ) So , when 's the party ? What party ? There 's no party . With your parents out of town ? Are you kidding me ? You know my house is not a frat for you and your NeanderthaI friends every time my parents go out of town . Yes , it is . Oh , Savannah . They want you in the office . Something about your brother . Shocker . miles ? miles ? Savannah , thank God . You look terrible . Are you okay ? He 's been trying to convince me that he is , but he 's not . I am okay . No , you 're not . BOTH : miles , sit down ! Put the thermometer back in your mouth . I was beginning to worry that I wouldn 't get a family member at all . I tried six different numbers for your parents and didn 't get ... They 're out of town . Home alone . So your brother said . I 'm almost 18 , Mrs. Bowen . Fine , then you 're in charge . 103 . You are not going anywhere , okay ? So , be the bigger sister and talk some sense into him . tell him to lie down and take it easy . Let me see the flesh wound . Savannah , I ... Let me see it . I don 't think ... Show me . AII right , here . I really think it 's not that big of a deal . I mean ... Oh , my God . Oh , my God . It got bigger . would someone like to tell me what caused this ? Savannah ? She doesn 't know . Let me talk to my brother for a second . Thank you . miles . I 'm okay . I cannot believe you did not tell Mom and Dad . You were the one who said don 't tell them . Yeah , that Nim came back . I didn 't know you had gangrene . miles ? miles ? Promise you won 't tell anyone . miles , stop it . miles ? Stop it ! Stop it ! miles ! miles ! Mrs. Bowen ! Come help ! Raymond . Raymond , call an ambulance ! RAYMOND : Right away ! miles ! miles ! You know , I think it 's gone . I think the shark 's gone . I think we scared it away , you know ? well , that 's good . I just hope it was us that did it . Yeah . Hey . Hey , don 't splash around like that with that thing in the water . Hey ! What do you want with that ? It 's a bunch of seaweed . No , it 's Chondrus crispus . It 's edible seaweed . You want some ? No . Uh-uh . I 'm all right . Why ? It 's really not that bad . You should eat . I 'm good . I ain 't that hungry . Hey , I thought Cajuns would eat anything . I tell you , I think it 's gonna be another cold one tonight . 26 hours ! 26 hours , and still no Jackson ! This ocean should be crawling with rescue vehicles . I think something happened to him . It 's tachypnea . His respirations are 40 and shallow . BP 's at 132 over 94 . What 's his name ? miles Barnett . He 's my brother . miles ? You wanna tell me how you 're feeling ? miles ? What 's his temperature ? We didn 't get a read , our unit broke . But he 's burning up . miles ! When did this start ? A couple hours ago , in school . please do something . He 's seizing . Let 's get a lumbar puncture . What 's the temperature ? 108.3 . DR. KELLINO : You ready ? Get him in there . Okay , go , go , go , go , go ! Get set . One , two , three ! What is he doing ? We 've got to get his temperature down . please , miss , just stay back . We 're doing everything we can for your brother ... Stop it ! Just stay back ! Get out of my way ! Nim ? Nim ? Nim ! help me ! help . help . Hey , miles , miles . It 's okay . It 's okay , I 'm here . Somebody help me ! Don 't worry . It 's okay , it 's okay . ( SHUSHING ) ( MAN CHATTERING OVER RADIO ) Dried blood . We got something here . shell casings . About a dozen . Must 've been a hell of a fight . ( THUNDER CRACKING ) ( SHIVERING ) ( WHIMPERING ) Hey . Hey . You were having a nightmare . Hmm . It 's so cold . I know . It 's killing me . ( GROANING ) You know , there is something that we could be doing that would keep us a little warmer . What ? We ... We could spoon . What ? I think that under the circumstances , my wife would understand . Okay , yeah , that 's good ... Fine , under the circumstances ... Okay then . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( SIGHING ) Laura , look . You see ? It kind of makes you feel a little small , don 't it ? What do you think they 're doing ? I don 't know . They 're communicating ? It 's sort of a migratory ritual or something . I don 't know what the apocalypse is supposed to look like , but I imagine it to be something like that . SAVANNAH : Mom ? Dad ? I 've been leaving messages everywhere I can think of . miles is sick . really sick . He 's in the hospital and you have to come home . I guess your cells are off or whatever , but ... I just hope you get this . So call . Okay ? call . Any luck ? No . We 're moving your brother to ICU . What ? What 's wrong with him ? well , that 's the problem . We don 't know exactly . The precise medical term is " a fever of unknown origin . " I told you the origin , that bite on his leg . The lesions on his leg have none of the indicators of an animal bite . There 's no tissue tearing , no punctures ... No , I told you and no infection . His white counts are normal . His labs are clean . Whatever 's causing that fever is not a normal inflammatory response . The only diagnostic issue we 've found is a severe electrolyte imbalance . I 'm gonna be real honest with you . I 'm at a loss here . With a fever that high ... What ? Your brother 's life is in danger . Is there anything you can think of to give us some context ? What if I showed you one like the thing that bit miles ? would that help ? ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) I hate the rain . I hate it . Yeah . It 's strange , but it reminds me of my grandmother . Every time I visited her , it was always raining out . She was a horrible woman . actually , she was very vain and manipulative . I remember this one time she , she was watching over me and it was raining , and we went to the store right as it was closing , you know , when the lights were being turned off . And we were rushing through the store and all of a sudden she started just trashing my mother , saying that my mother wasn 't worthy of my father . ( RICH SIGHING ) She was a horrible woman to say that to such a little kid , and I didn 't really understand at the time . ( CREATURE GROWLING ) ( BOTH SCREAMING ) ( GASPING ) ( COUGHING ) ( GAGGING ) Rich ! I 'm here ! Rich ! No , don 't you move ! Come on , swim to me . Get the bag ! The bag has the camera in it ! Rich , the camera bag . ( GRUNTING ) I got it ! Come on . Come on ! ( CREATURE GROWLING ) Come on ! Swim ! Swim ! It 's coming ! Come on . Grab on . Grab on . ( CREATURE GROWLING ) Nim ? Nim . Nim . Nim . Nim ? Nimmy ? Nim ? Nim ? ( THUDDING ) Nim , Nim , come back ! Come back ! Nim . Nim , come back ! Nim ! ( SCREAMING ) Who let you in ? I knocked . How 's miles ? Not good . I gotta find Nimrod . I didn 't know you knew his name . Nimmy ? So you know , miles doesn 't really call him like that . Then why don 't you tell me how , phil , huh ? I don 't know , you gotta ask miles . I thought you both related . No , that 's miles . He has the ESP . I don 't think he needs to call him . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Find him . Mom ? Dad ? No , I 'm sorry , this is paul bloom from over at the aquarium . Is Miles there ? No . Well , he wasn 't at work today . I just wanted to check to see if everything was okay . miles is in the hospital . Why ? They don 't have any idea . Something bit him when he was in the water . Wait a minute . I 'm , I 'm sorry , I don 't understand . Are you telling me miles was bitten ? ( WHIMPERING ) ( NIM CRYING ) Got him . I gotta go . What 's going on ? Stay there . You stay there . What 're you doing ? I 'm just gonna redistribute the weight . No , no . Don 't get off of the raft . I 'm not getting off , I 'm just redistributing . Okay . Get some more over here to you . There you go . There you go . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( GASPING ) She was just protecting her eggs . Let 's get the hell out of here . No , stay here , they work as a shield . Huh ? They might keep us from getting killed . ( GROANING ) ( BEEPING ) Take it easy , we 're right here . Mom . No , honey , it 's not your mother . She 'II be here soon . tell her ... tell her that it wasn 't Nim 's fault . Wasn 't whose fault ? Nim . It ... It wasn 't Nim 's fault . He 's not the one who bit me . Okay . Okay . Okay . He didn 't ... He didn 't do it . I 'm gonna get you something so you can rest . tell her . Okay , okay . ( NIM GRUNTING ) Excuse me . Can you please get Dr. KeIIino for me ? She 's with a patient right now . Okay . well , then , can you tell her that I have it ? I 'm sorry . Who are you ? My name is Savannah Barnett . My brother is miles ... Savannah ? I 'm paul bloom . Mr. bloom ? please come with me quickly . I have one of the things that bit miles . miles is keeping one of these things ? For weeks , he didn 't want anyone to know . ( SIGHING ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) We 're going to die . Don 't say that . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Can you see that light ? Look at that . You see that ? Look at that light . See it ? The eggs ! well , someone 's gonna see us from the light from the eggs . So this animal thing , whatever it is , is now loose in my hospital , is responsible for two attacks ? That 's great . Is there a reason why local ers weren 't notified ? We were just beginning to investigate . So what 's the story with this other victim , that guy from Southport ? The attack was fatal . Get security . tell them we 've got an animal loose in ICU . NURSE : Yes , doctor . ( CARDIOGRAPH BEEPING ) ( NIM GRUNTING ) Stay back .

Look , there 's two of them at Ieast , a guy and a girl . call the radio , get the rescue gear out . Roger that . ( SHOUTING ) Over here ! Hey ! ( LAUGHING ) ( CRYING ) ( GROWLING ) Hey ! Get out of the way ! What the hell was that ? I don 't know , but I am backing off . Backing off ! What ? You can 't leave us , please ! please , no ! please ! Hey ! DR. KELLINO : Charge to 200 .

 For the gods keep the secrets of life hidden from humans . Men did , however , figure out one secret : How to use fire . And Zeus punished them with the worst thing he could think of . Something so terrible ... the writer Hesiod called it the source of all mortal suffering . Any guess what punishment he came up with ? Some kind of disease ? No . - War ? - Nope . Fire ? Floods ? Drought ? None of those . For their punishment , Zeus gave them ... women . - Hello ? Uncle Tom ? - Back here , in my office . Hey . - So , what 's today 's experiment ? - Biosynthesis . There are extinct plant-cell walls in this fossil . Crinoids , a type of echinoderm . The mature crinoids artificially resemble flowers . Hence the name ... ? - Sea lily . - Very good . You know , theoretically , I could use the molecular genetic material ... to create a whole new breed of crinoid . Isn 't that a little unnatural ? Yeah . But interesting , right ? You seem distracted . Is everything all right ? It 's Oxford . They called me again this morning . But I can 't go to England and leave you here . You 're the only family I 've got . I 'll see you later . I have another class . Hey , Uncle Tom . What are you cooking ? A fabulous red-wine sauce . I hope you 're hungry . Tempting , but I have a date . He should already be here . As far as going to England is concerned ... you 're too talented for this little town . Oh , but I thought we already settled that . But what if I came with you ? Really ? You 're bright . You deserve it . And anyway , I 'm getting a little homesick . It 'll do us both good . I don 't know what to say . In cases like that , it 's better to say nothing . A toast . To your future . And to Oxford . Oh , that must be him . Don 't wait up . And thank you . Get out of here . Have fun . Miss ? Jesus Christ . Miranda ? Hey , Miranda , come on . We 're gonna be late . Miranda , come on , you ... - What have we got ? - Female . No ID . Early 20s . Some kind of skin rash . Some jogger found her passed out in the park . Uncle Tom . I hope you 're hungry . Tempting , but I have a date . You 're bright . To your future . Miss , I need you to give me your name . What 's your name ? Miranda ... Hollander . Hollander . These blood levels can 't be right . These aren 't human . We shot them . That 's how they came out . Yeah , right . Nice try . Stop screwing me . Go and do the x-ray . Okay , you 're the boss . Whatever you say . Just stay still and relax , ma 'am . I just need to shoot another x-ray . What the heck ? Edward , what kind of joke is this ? Get out ! - What 's going on ? - Just get in the car , Miranda . I don 't understand . When are you gonna tell me what 's going on ? We 're going to Mexico . Mexico ? Why ? Well , it 's beautiful down there . Haven 't you always wanted to see it ? Is it the police you 're afraid of ? Yup . Whatever happened at the hospital , I had nothing to do with it . Right ? Are you saying I killed those people ? Yes . And no . Yes and no ? What are you not telling me ? You 're sick . And I can 't help you . Sick ? With what ? I wish I knew . But , Uncle Tom , if I 'm sick ... shouldn 't I go see a doctor in the United States ? No . They can 't help you , either . Why not ? We 're going to Mexico ... to find someone named Forbes . He 's an old colleague of mine from the university . I was his professor . Though sometimes , I wondered whether it wasn 't him teaching me . He was brilliant . Crazy , but brilliant . I haven 't seen him in years because I ... I didn 't wanna have anything more to do with him . But he 's the only one that can ... That might be able to help you , Miranda . I tried . But I ... I guess I failed . Tell me . I didn 't always work with fossils , Miranda . I always wanted to tell you the truth , I just didn 't know how . The truth about what ? Forbes and I made you ... in our lab ... as part of a project we were working on . I tried to keep it from you . I just wanted you to have a normal life . No . There were these DNA strands ... from somewhere else ... sent to us . I mean ... to Earth . We mixed those DNA strands with human genes . Experimented with a new kind of life . You were one of the results . But it was wrong ... so I walked away from it . But I didn 't want anything to happen to you ... so I took you with me ... and raised you as best as I could as a normal human being . You were all that mattered to me , Miranda . You 're lying . Not this time , Miranda . What about your parents ? Do you really remember them ? My mother was your sister . No . I 'm an only child . They never existed . All your childhood memories ... were one big story I told you when you were young ... again and again till you believed it . You only think you remember . I lied until you stopped asking me where you came from . Until you believed we were just ... two normal , happy ... human beings . I 'm sorry . I am so ... terribly sorry . It 's okay . It 's okay . So why would Forbes live in Mexico ? I guess some people come down here to disappear . What did you two have a falling out over , anyway ? Well , let 's just say we didn 't see eye to eye . I thought what we were doing was immoral , he didn 't . He was abusing the project . Uncle Tom . - What 's that ? - Human hormones . I 've been administering them to you while you slept . Just two or three times a year ... to keep the aliens side of your biology from surfacing . And ever since you got sick ... they don 't seem to work as well . So , what exactly is wrong with me ? I wish I knew . It could be an infection or a toxic reaction of some sort . Whatever it is , I don 't know enough about your biology to cure it . Forbes is the one who designed you ... so he 's the only one who might be able to help . It 's going down . Yeah , for now . You 're a mixture of human and alien DNA . And a highly functional hybrid . You can soak up a body of knowledge like no human can . I didn 't teach you anything , Miranda . This look familiar ? Of course . This is the complete works of Shakespeare . And I read this a hundred times . You 've never opened that book in your life . That 's not possible . Okay . You know nothing about cars , right ? Right . So what ? Take this . Close your eyes . You know that clicking noise you have ? You should switch to a higher-octane gas , that 's why ... That 's why you get that metallic tapping sound . If you 'll sign here , sir ? Your keys , senorita . Enjoy . I 'm looking for an American who lives down here , the name of Forbes McGuire ? I 'm not familiar with this gentleman . Perhaps I can make some inquiries . Thank you . I 'd appreciate it . Hey . Where are you going ? I 'm going to find Forbes . Why don 't you stay in and rest ? I filled the syringe with hormones . If the rash gets worse while I 'm gone ... inject it . I 'll see you later . Hey , nino . - No . - No ? Okay , gracias . Let me in ! - Hold on there . Where 's the fire ? - Excuse me . Excuse me . Say , I know you . Leland Fisk . San Antonio , Texas . Same hotel . How would you like to go for a drink ? - No , no , thank you . - Oh , come on . Come on , I 'm buying . Yeah . Look ... I heard you back at the hotel asking that Calderon fellow ... about finding a certain somebody . Well , I 'll tell you something . Unless you give him a bribe , he ain 't gonna do nothing . Well , that 's the way it is with these Mexicans . They play dumb until you play ball . Now , you seem like a right nice fellow , so I 'll tell you what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna cut through all that bull and I 'm gonna hook you right up . What are you getting at ? You wanna know how to find Forbes , huh ? I 'm gonna tell you . Now , at midnight ... you go down to the Square of the Blessed Maiden . There will be a taxicab there . You wait till he flashes his lights . Then you go over and you get in the back seat of the taxi . Any business you have with Forbes , you put it in an envelope ... - and you give it to the driver . - I 'm looking for Forbes McGuire . Hey , where are we ? Is this where he lives ? I 'm a friend of Forbes . I just wanna talk to him . Hey , buddy , are you listening to me ? Hold on . I 'm coming . Goddamn . Hold your goddamn horses . I said , I 'm coming . You don 't look so good . Goddamn you . You set me up , you son of a bitch . - Now , you just hold on . - No . I don 't care who put you up to it ... but God help me , I 'm not leaving here until you tell me where I find Forbes . Well , I don 't think you 're tough enough to be telling me what to do ... in my own hotel room . You are trespassing . Put the gun down . Well , lookie here . Oh , is that your new bodyguard , huh ? Put it down now . Oh , I 'm so scared . I 'm scared . I 'm ... That cowboy better not be setting us up again . What is this place ? He can 't be here . Listen . Whoever 's here ... they 're behind this door . Yeah , but how do we get in ? Yeah , giddyap , girl . That 's it , girl . Giddyap , that 's the way . That 's the way I like it . Fantastic . Go on . Go on , why don 't you ? Why don 't you ? Oh , that 's it , girl . Come on , sweetheart . Oh , baby . McGuire . What the ... ? Oh , shit . I don 't believe it . As I live and breathe . Tom Hollander . Why did you try to have me killed ? What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about the nun . You know , the one with the tentacles . - And your friend , the cab driver . - Okay , then . I do not know what you 're talking about . You haven 't changed , have you ? Hey . Hi , sweetheart . Forbes McGuire . Have we met somewhere before ? And by the by 's , how did you two get in here anyhow ? You left out a keypad for us . Oh , my God . We have met before . You 're G-178 . Her name 's Miranda . Whatever . She 's gorgeous . Oh , right . Everyone , yeah , this is Azura . Azura is my director of community relations . We 've already met . This was your nun . What ? Oh , for God 's sakes , Azura . Listen , Tom . I 'm really sorry , mate . I had no idea you were here . That 's because no one tells me anything anymore . It 's the trouble with these inferior models . No complex thinking , love . Absolutely no high intellectual functioning . But this one . Come on , sweetheart . Tell me a little bit about yourself . I hold advance degrees in biochemistry , comparative literature and classics . Well , well , well . All right , Tom Hollander . You sly old fox , huh ? I mean , come on . Frankenstein built some stumbling drunk with bolts to his forehead . Another bloke at Caltech wins tenure for getting a robot to peel an orange . And you , you come up with this . The Holy Grail of every man 's dream . - What the ... ? - Miranda . Miranda . What 's happening to her ? She 's sick . That 's the only reason we 're here . Put her up there . We need an IV line of 50 cc 's of hormones . Oh , no shit . Look , I do know what I 'm doing , okay ? Now , keep an eye on her blood pressure . We need to stabilize her human hormone levels and quick . Come on , sweetheart . Stay with me . Quickly . You 're playing with fire , you know that ? Look , I dabble , okay ? You know , once in a while I try something out . For Christ 's sakes , if I can really make someone 's dream come true ... by giving them back a dead relative or whatever , then why not ? Because it 's not their dead relative . It may look like them , but they 're half alien . Do your clients even know that ? They don 't need to . I 'm telling you , these things are safe . The alien side always never comes out , I 've worked out most of the kinks . What about your cab driver ? Look , who knows , you know ? Random behavior . So , okay , there 's been one or two mistakes ... things I never should 've made . And admittedly , you know , one or two of those mistakes ... might have escaped into town , but they 're unstable . They die off in a month or two . Look , it 's cool . Trust me . What 's wrong with Miranda ? Any ideas ? Yeah . So , what is it ? What does she have ? Old age . Come again ? Mortality , mate . There 's nothing actually wrong with her . She 's just reached the end of her life span . Her ? Are you crazy ? Look at her . Yeah , I know . It 's hard to believe , isn 't it ? She 's young , she 's beautiful . And soon she 's gonna die . How long ? I mean , you know , until ... Soon . I don 't know , today . Maybe tomorrow . I could try making you another one . Might not be as smart . Whatever you might think , Miranda 's a human being . Well , then tell her the truth . Tell her she 's gonna die . I mean , isn 't that what being a human being is all about ? What about Azura ? What are you gonna do when she dies ? Don 't you care about her ? Oh , hell , no . Just pop out another one . Blond , probably . Green eyes and a tan . I mean , come on , mate . It 's the beauty of all this . No . Look , all right , then don 't tell her . After all , you lied to her in the first place about what she really was . Was that because you respected her as a human being ? Or was it just a convenient way of keeping things in control ? Shit , mate . Don 't listen to me . What do I know ? I mean , look at me . Look at this place down here . I 'm the one who should have died off a long time ago . I tell you , between me , you , and the guide post ... I kind of hope one of these buggers polishes me off someday . Miranda . I raised you as my niece ... but I love you like my daughter . Unfortunately ... there 's nothing he can do . And I ... just want you to know ... I 'm truly sorry . There is something I wanna see . You name it . I don 't know if I 'm human or not ... or if I have a soul or not . But whatever I 've done , I have to settle it . But , Miranda , whatever you wanna do , we 'll do . Wherever you wanna go , we 'll go . I 'd like to be back home . - Of course , but ... - And go to the police there . The police ? I killed people in that hospital . I need to take responsibility for that . Miranda . Even if ... Even if I don 't make it home ... I have to try . Group hug ? Come on , you two . Come with me . Okay . So there is one way to extend Miranda 's life . Why didn 't you tell us this before ? Because it requires ending someone else 's . No way . I won 't be a party to a murder . You won 't get caught , right ? People disappear around here all the time . Nobody asks too many questions . You gotta try and think of it as a genetic transplant . You know , a complete infusion of living , healthy hybrid cells . Miranda , it 's the only way for you to go on . It 's immoral . Immoral ? Give me a break . This town is full of scumbags . Cheats , liars , murderers , rapists , you name it . Take one of those guys off the street , hell , we 're doing a public service . Well , that 's ... That 's not the point . I 'm not a killer . There must be another way . Something else we can try . You have to let me accept this . I 've had a good life . And mostly because of you . So have you thought about what you 'll do ... afterwards ? Forbes is a lost soul ... living in a pit of misery . Maybe you should help him . Is there nothing good that can come out of this ? I told you ... I want nothing more to do with this technology . So you 'd leave him here ... and go back to working in a museum ? Can you honestly tell me you 've been satisfied ... working with things that have been dead for thousands of years ? Uncle ... don 't you miss your true scientific work ? You are my true scientific work . Miranda ? Oh , my God . Hey , hey . Hey , hey , hey . Right here , mate . Get her on the table . Clamp her down and make it quick . We need to get a sedative inside her before she fully turns . - Turns ? - Yeah . She 's fighting for her life . And that 's when the less attractive , the very , very strong side comes out . Come on . Okay . Okay , that will stabilize her for a little while . But we need to do a human graft soon or we 'll definitely lose her . Now go out and give me a donor . I need a female and bring her back alive . Me ? You want me to ... ? Yeah . It 's time to get your hands dirty . Do you wanna save her or not ? Go ! Looking for me ? Maybe . Do you want to dance ? - Sure . - Let 's go . Should we go somewhere else ? I know a place . No . Do me here . - Turn around . - What ? No . Hey , hey . Turn around , prick . - You 're kidding . - Pervert . You prick . I don 't believe this . You 're robbing me ? Now , where do you want it ? One on the leg or two in the ass ? Stop wasting time . Let 's take her and go . Come on , let 's get you home . You had a little too much tonight . Who are you pricks ? Where am I ? Let me go . Let me go . Shut up ! You 're about to be harvested . Please ! Please , let me go . Please , please . Why ? Let me go . No . No , no . First off ... we 're gonna impregnate Collette with alien DNA . - Time to go fishing . - Oh , God . Hey , no worries , mate . She won 't feel a thing . This is monstrous . Fertilization achieved . Now , the trick here is injecting the stem cells ... at just the right point in their evolution . In other words ... now . I 've forgotten how fast this thing went . Hey , hey , hey , what 's happening ? The cells are infusing all over her body . Well , that can 't be good . - Come on , you 're killing her . - Vital signs , critical . - Now stop this . Stop it now . - Hey , hey , hey . It 's done , dude . It 's out of my control . Oh , crap . Miranda , easy , easy . Easy . It 's me . Come on , Miranda . Miranda , come on . It 's me . It 's okay . You 're all right now . Come on . Hi . Where am I ? In the presence of two bloody geniuses , that 's where . Guess what . You 're all better now . - But how did you ... ? - Stem cells , baby . Here , drink some water . Temperature 's normal . Blood pressure 's excellent . All systems are go . I don 't know how to thank you . Hey , look what I found for you . Ovid 's Metamorphoses . I never thought I 'd read Latin again . Intellectual functions appear present . The Metamorphoses is about people getting changed into other creatures . Your idea of a joke ? Yeah , well , then again ... we haven 't heard her conjugate any Greek verbs yet . Try me . I 'll give you all the tenses . Past , present , future , subjunctive . What have we done , mate ? Okay , I 'll stop . - Just let me do one thing . - What 's that ? Fuck this girl here . Miranda , what are you ... ? What are you talking about ? You 're director ... of community relations . Let me fuck her . Azura , there 's something I wanted to talk to you about outside . Just come with me , babe . Miranda , are you feeling okay ? Never better . So where to ? We can 't go home , right ? Police are probably looking for me . I thought you wanted to talk to them ... and face up to the whole thing ? Why , so I can rot in jail ? What 's the point of extending my life if I can 't enjoy it ? Regardless , I think it might be a good idea to go back to the hotel . You need some rest . Rest ? I 'm not tired . I 'm going to go live . Experience things . So , what do you say ... we grab one of Forbes ' bottles of top-shelf tequila ... and get naked ? Hey , hey . Come on , what are you talking about ? Oh , come on . I know the truth now . You 're not my real uncle . No . No , Miranda , no . No . Fine . Fuck you , then . What 's up ? Is this some perverted stunt of yours ? What the hell have you done to her ? I extended her life just like you asked me to . - There might be one or two glitches ... - Have you seen her blood cells ? It 's chaos . She 's not stabilizing . We 've gotta do something . Another transfusion . - More stem cells . - That won 't help . That woman 's here to pick up the dog . Look , hang on a second , mate . God 's sake . Azura . You got the money ? - Lady . - Yes . Yes . Here 's the money . There it is . Release form . Oh , my sweet , sweet Pamela . It 's you . Actually , it 's a fucking alien facsimile . You might wanna remember that . My good girl . You 's a good girl . It 's you . Hey , man , I 'm sorry about that . - Had a bit of business to take ... - Miranda ? Miranda ? She 's gone . You hear ? She 's gone . I gotta find her . She 's sick . - She 's not just sick , she 's dangerous . - I don 't care . Listen , mate , if you 're gonna go , at least take this . - What the hell is that ? - Hydrochloric acid . Now , it won 't kill her , but it might slow her down . - This dosage , on the other hand ... - I 'm not gonna kill her . I 'm gonna fine her , bring her back here , refine the hormones ... temper the mixture and get her back to what she was . - Do not underestimate these things . - Stand out of my way . This is your fault , McGuire . You always did sloppy work . Listen , Tom , I 'm telling you . She 's got no human imperative anymore , she 's pure creature . She 'll likely be pregnant before nightfall . In two weeks , this entire town will be overrun . - She 's sterile . I took care of that . - I wouldn 't count on it . With new stem cells , there 's no telling what she might do . We 've gotta kill her . Face it , Tom , she 's not human . She 's not your little girl anymore . If you weren 't so obsessed , you 'd see that . Look , mate , if you won 't kill her , then we have to bring her back here . - Wait , Tom . Let me help you . - Do what you want . I 'm telling you , you can 't stop her alone . You 're gonna get yourself killed . Miranda ? Miranda . Senorita . May I do something for you ? I think so . I must ask you ... to cover yourself , senorita . It 's okay . I know ... you like me . I knew from the beginning . Miranda ? Miranda ? Senor . Oh , you scared me . Where 's Miranda ? Everything was fine until you two showed up . I should have killed you in the alley . Not so good ... you humans . You don 't have to do this . Genesis 20 . Behold , thou art but a dead man . Your dress . I want it . - You want my dress ? - Yeah , take it off . You know what ? Got a better idea . Why don 't you better get out of here right now , bitch ? Oh , you mean my dress ? In my ear . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Kiss me lightly . Hey , hey , hey . - A monster , it killed my compadre . - Oh , crap . Where did she go ? The monster ? - Over there . - Right . Bingo . Well , here goes . Miranda ? Miranda ? The innkeeper was one of mine and he was sterile . Otherwise , you 'd be pregnant by now . Turn around . You have wanted to fuck me since the moment we met . Miranda ? Oh , God . Where am I ? It 's okay . It 's okay . Relax . Relax , Miranda . Tom . Lay down . Tom , I need your help . Of course . Anything . We have to end this . Hang in there . Hang in there . The human side of me is dying . And I don 't want what 's left . It 's over . You know what you 've got to do . Thanks ... for giving me life . You were right , Miranda . You were always right .

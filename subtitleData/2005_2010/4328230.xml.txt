 This programme contains some strong language . Torchwood , outside the Government , beyond the police . Tracking down Alien life on earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes and you 've got to be ready . Diane Holmes . How have you done this to me ? Love , you 're always at its mercy . Hate to break it to you , but you 're not my first . Anti-Weevil spray . Handclamps . Come on , let 's make this easy for both of us . This always happens when I give them the night off . It 's not even really medium , let alone well done . French places , see . Remember that weekend in Paris , the place with the wood panelling - they 'd barely even waved the steak under the grill and you said ... Why are you looking at me like that ? Sorry , like what ? Like you 'd rather be somewhere else ! It 's becoming the norm , in 't it ? I 'm chopsing away and I look up and you 're just absent . What 's happening to us , Gwen ? I know . I 'm sorry . Is it something I 've done ? Or not done ? What the hell was that ? Oh , God , what 's happened to you ? Rhys , is it ? Nice to meet you ! Sorry , it 's an emergency , I 'll have her back for dessert . Come on ... Hold on , that 's my girlfriend . Rhys , this is Jack . Sit down , Gwen . He 's my boss . Sit the fuck down ! Don 't ever speak to me like that . Come on , Gwen . Let 's go . Hey , she 's with me tonight . One night off . You promised . Don 't you dare . If you go now , Gwen ... ! Sorry for cutting in , but I 've been having trouble with this one . Rhys will get over it . He always does . You promised you 'd keep hold of your life . Don 't let it drift . WATCH BEEPS 300 metres on the right , car park ! Jack ! Over there ! Get him in , get him in ! They 're fucking mad ! Hey ! Who the hell were they ? ! One - since when did other people know about Weevils ? Two - have they done this before and if so why didn 't we know about it ? Three - what do they want with them anyway ? Might not be connected , but we 've noticed a surge of unusual injuries being reported at the AE unit . Chunks taken out of legs and arms , deep wounds to backs and stomachs . So we have a wave of Weevil attacks to add to our problems . And by the way , that spray we 've used on them previously ? They 're becoming immune to it . They 're mutating ? Or evolving . So any sign of the one we lost earlier ? I 've run a trace on the van 's number plate ... it 's fake . 2,500 vans of that type registered in the Cardiff area . Widen that to a forty mile radius and the number doubles . So , run a trace on the vehicle . Route via traffic cameras ? This is Owen 's voice mail , leave a message if you must . Processing now . Leave a message for Gwen and Rhys , and we 'll call you back ... if we remember ... oi ! Hi , it 's me . I 've left three messages now . Look , I 've got dozens of excuses , em ... .. hundreds . Thousands ! But none of them good enough . Things have got away from me a bit lately . It 's this job - it never lets up . Look , I 'll see you later . I 'm not sure what time yet . I 've got some work to finish off first . Call me . Message deleted . MOBILE RINGS Are you going to answer that ? Ninth missed call - work . Do you enjoy your job then ? Look , if you don 't mind ... I came out to be alone . Ah , the old Greta Garbo . Something like that . Little bit of advice - next time you feel like this , you should stay in . Trust me , the bigger the crowd , the more alone I feel . I said - no chatting up the punters . Tommy , I work in a bar . It 's my job to speak to them . You 're never happier than when you 're flashing your tits at a dickhead . Don 't talk to her like that . You what ? We were having a conversation . When you grown up , you 'll realise that 's what human beings do . Tommy , stop . You 'll get me the sack ! It 's about using your opponent 's aggression to your own ends . Now , I 'd suggest you don 't pick fights with strangers . And you should really upgrade your boyfriend . What does a man have to do to get some peace in this city ? MOBILE RINGS Owen 's still not answering his phone. he 's been even more erratic than usual since that thing with Diane . Since the what ? It 's none of my business . What thing ? What thing , Tosh ? Owen and Diane . Before she took the plane , they had a ... thing . You knew that , right ? Oh , yeah , of course I knew that . I just didn 't know they had a thing ... thing . It started ten minutes ago . WEEVIL HOWLS What d 'you think it 's doing ? I think it 's weeping . Why ? Owen 's been studying this one , thinks they have a low level of telepathic ability to share emotion across distance . You mean it might be feeling the pain of another Weevil ? I kinda hope we 're wrong , though . Why ? Because that would mean somebody 's not only kidnapping Weevils , they 're causing them pain . What can you feel ? What do you know ? I 've tracked the van 's route . It went straight from the car park out to the docks . This was two hours ago . What happened ? The CCTV cameras went down . D 'you think it was deliberate ? I think these guys really don 't like to be watched . See , and I know it 's a character flaw ... that makes me all the more determined to find out what it is they 're hiding . Looks like we missed them . Yeah , but if you quit places in a hurry , you tend to be forgetful . Y 'know what they used these warehouses for during World War Two ? Storing the bodies of dead Gls . Sometimes , you can know too much history . DOOR CLANGS Come on . There 's nothing here . So what were they doing here ? Why come all this way out ? What is it ? Looks human . Male . Is he alive ? Hello ? You OK there ? We 're looking for the people who were here last night ! If you saw anything , now 's a good time to speak up . Jack , he 's bleeding ! Oh , my God ! Weevil marks . You don 't think it 's still here ? No . We 'd hear it . Now help me with the body . FUNNY RING TONE Is that his ? You don 't think I 'd choose that ring tone ? Don 't answer it . Hello ? ' I don 't know who you are . 'Stay out of what doesn 't concern you . ' Who killed this man ? 'Did you hear what I just said ? ' I have this selective deafness when I 'm talking to cowards or murderers . 'Don 't interfere in things you don 't understand . ' Oh , I understand this better than you . Cos I know how this is going to end - we 're going to hunt you down . We 're going to ensure that you 're punished for what happened here . And we 're going to make you surrender that creature that you kidnapped . Is that clear enough ? Ianto ? I need you to trace all calls to and from this number in the last 24 hours . Fast as you can . We 're on our way back . MOBILE RINGS This is Owen 's voicemail . Don 't leave a message . Nice try , Owen . I want you back at the Hub immediately . We 've got a Weevil murder , so get your boney little ass over here now . Dan Hodges , date of birth , 21st of January 1979 . Salesman for web publishing software . Looks like he was married with a kid . Yeah , no shit , Sherlock . Right , definitely death by Weevil , but he took a right kicking before the throat was punctured . Weevils go for the kill , straight for the jugular . Look at his face - black eye , bruises to the cheekbones . Same across the back and the ribs . Could he have been tortured ? Maybe . But I reckon these wounds were inflicted by humans . But why smack somebody about and then set the Weevil on them ? Why not get the Weevil do all the work for you ? Any joy with the phone records ? The last incoming number was blocked . The phone 's call history has been erased . God , they move fast . You ask me , these guys are using Weevils to carry out the perfect murder . No fingerprints , no traces of recognisable DNA , ... a quick , guaranteed death . Nothing to connect anyone to the murder . Right . Should be a piece of piss to find the killer , then . What about this guy ? Someone 's got to break it to his wife that he 's dead . The shittiest part about being a police officer and I can 't get away from it . Thanks for your kind words of support . What d 'you want me to say ? She 'll be all right in the end ? You can always count on Owen to make you feel better . Tosh mentioned you and Diane ... Did you ... I didn 't want her to go . She went . Why are we still doing this , me and you ? Fine . Let 's not . I was getting bored of your fuck-tricks , anyway . You can be such a wanker sometimes , Owen , d 'you know that ? I do , as a matter of fact ! Where the hell have you been ? Walking . Well , in your absence , Toshiko 's had a great idea . Well , it had to happen sooner or later . Ignore him , Tosh . Yeah , just ignore me , Tosh . I can be such a wanker . Apparently . The van went with the Weevil straight to the warehouse . They must 've known it was empty . Either they own it or had previous contact with the estate agents . Owen Harper , you 're going into property . Toshiko 's in the middle of fixing you a cover story . Hang on , why me ? Jack and Gwen were in the car park , I was in the warehouse . If they 've got access to CCTV , they 'll recognise us . We have to get under their guard , find out what 's going on . Yeah , all right . I could do with being someone else right now . Mr Harper ? Yeah . Mark Lynch . You 're looking to relocate your business to Cardiff ? Yeah . And you export jellied eels . Really ? Huge growth market . China , South America , I 'm having a nightmare trying to keep up with demand . I 'll er ... get you a batch if you find me the right gaff . I think I 'll pass on that . Any family to relocate ? Just me . It 's better that way . And you 're looking for premises out by the docks ? Mmm , nice big warehouse , that 's what I need . I 've got a couple that should be perfect . Hang on while I print . Thanks . We 're in ! This 'll give us everything on his hard drive , including encrypted files . If I can establish a routing protocol , whatever he does on this computer from now on , we 'll know about it . Owen , you 're clear . These have got the square footage you 're looking for , good access , competitively priced ... Except ... these all look like shitholes to me . Yeah . They are a bit . Didn 't I see your sign outside a big place in the Q section of the docks ? We 've accepted an offer on it . Pretty much signed and sealed . He 's lying . According to their records , it only went on the market last week . Bummer . What about a unit on an industrial estate ? Save a ton on rent , even after transport costs . And you just happen to have a list of suitable premises ? Nah . There are other possibilities . You free at the end of the day ? Yeah . Go for a drink ? On your own in a strange city . I remember that feeling . And look at you now . Couple of gorgeous birds answering your phones for you . If that 's not success , I dunno what is ! It 's all bollocks , really . But , if you wanted me to put in a good word ... No . Thanks . Good to meet you , Mark . Yeah . I 'll give you a bell . First , he 'll go for the weblink at the top of the page ... Then he 'll want to know what other people say about the business . Now he 'll see what Owen has to say about himself . Welcome to the number one supplier of jellied eels to Britain and Northern Europe . With a client base of more than 150 resellers , we 're constantly looking to expand into new territories . If you 're interested in becoming an affiliate or Harper 's franchise holder , please contact our Sales Director on the number below . Harper 's sales . Jenny Long speaking . I 'm sorry , wrong number . Job done . I 've found another set of suspicious injuries at the hospital . They sound pretty bad . Tosh , stay here and monitor Mark Lynch 's movements . Ianto with me .. I 'll come with you . Go home . But ... It 's not a request . Remember - don 't let it drift . What you doing ? You here now , are you ? That 's your pulling top . No , it 's not . It is ! That 's what you call it , since I said you looked sexy in it . You off out ? Aye , Daf 's stag do . All day job . Since when is Daf getting married ? He 's not . But he thinks he 's missing out on a piss-up . He 's having a Staying Single Stag . Few beers , see what transpires . Strip club , that sort of thing . What time will you be back ? Not sure . But ... I 'm in tonight . Well , I 'm not . I 've already made my statement to the police . According to your chart , you nearly had your heart torn from your ribcage . Ten-hour operation to repair chest wounds . Why should I talk to you ? Let me tell you what did this to you . Six feet high , teeth like a shark , rippled skin and the rage of a wild animal . Am I close ? I was mugged . There was three of them , they had knives . So why were your wounds described by paramedics as bite marks ? Look , I can 't help it if they got mixed up . They 're overworked . There are lots of ways I can get you to talk , but the easiest would be if you consider the consequences should you not tell me the truth . And that is , this creature will attack again . Somebody will die . And it will be on your conscience . Now tell us the truth . I can 't . They 'd kill me . Who 'd kill you ? Everyone . What did he mean , " everyone " ? That was all he 'd say . Couldn 't get any more out of him . That leaves us one option . OK , Janet . Time for a trip out . You call it Janet ? Barbara just never seemed right . You want to release a Weevil in the middle of Cardiff ? ! Not exactly in the middle . A little to the side . We placed a tracker in its boiler suit , so when they capture it , we 'll know where they are . It could kill any number of people before then ! I 'm with Tosh . We set it loose in the same place where they took the other one . It 's deserted this time of night . We 'll be with it every step of the way . Tracker working ? Yeah . Go Janet ! Second right . 200 metres ahead . Shit ! Stop the car ! She 's taken a left . Pedestrian access only ! Ahh ! Ianto , take over ! Now that 's what I call service . Cheers . Yeah . Cheers . Shit . We got a problem here , boys ? Not with you . Come on then , let 's get it over with . No need for you to get involved , sweetheart . Get up ! Thanks . The Weevil has landed . Got a signal ? Yeah . Just so I know where we stand ? We would never deliberately put a human being through that . But Weevils are fair game . Is that right ? We need to follow them . This is your gaff ? Make yourself at home . I 'm in the wrong business . So , what 's your outlet ? Er , for what ? The anger . Who said I was angry ? You 're not even living here yet and you 've got people coming after you ! Yeah , well . some people need teaching a lesson . I 'm not criticising . You 're not the only pissed off bloke out there . It 's what the world does to us . Fancy a beer ? Yeah , why not . You work yourself stupid . Get a house , a car , plasma screen ... You end up with a workforce , people there specifically to look after your every whim . You 're officially successful . And what does it bring ? Nothing . Success has no worth other than itself . Seriously , I could live without all this . It doesn 't define me . Yeah , nice to have it , though , yeah ? Ask yourself , what 's the point of your life ? Mark , mate , ... I only came here for a beer . There 's so much more . If you know where to look . Is that right ? It 's closer than you think . Something 's coming . Out there in the darkness , something is coming . You drunk ? Two pints was all I could get down . They 've gone on without me . Look , Gwen ... I need to tell you something . What sort of thing ? I 've been sleeping ... I 've been having sex with someone else . From work . His name 's Owen . He 's a tosser and it 's all gonna stop but ... Shut up . I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . You wouldn 't do that ! But I have . The .. then why are you telling me ? Because I 'm ashamed . And I 'm angry . And I want ... I need ... I need you to forgive me . And because I 've drugged you . You 've done what ? ! Just sit down . It 's nothing , it 's just an amnesia pill . Dash of sedative . You 'll wake up tomorrow , and you 'll forget everything . Rhys ? God , you selfish bitch ! I know , I just thought it would give us a chance , a chance to get everything out in the open , you know ? Get everything out . Rhys ! Stay with me , Rhys ! Say you forgive me , say , " It 's all right , Gwen . " Gwen , it 's all right . " Say it , please , Rhys . Rhys , just say it once , say it once , " I forgive you . " Rhys , please say it ! Say you forgive me ! Say you forgive me , say it . Say it , please , say it . Say it , please . You found the bathroom yet ? Yeah , cheers ! GROWLS Told you there was more to see . Mark , mate , I 'm really sorry . I couldn 't resist a padlock ... What do you think ? What is it ? No idea . Don 't get too close , though . Vicious bastard . Where did you get it from ? I found one on the streets . It took five of us to bring it in . Other than that , haven 't got a clue . Scientific experiment gone wrong ? Nuclear victim ? One of the lads even reckons it 's an alien . Want to know what I think ? Yeah , go on . I think it 's us , Owen . You and me . In a thousand years ' time . This is what we become , when all we have left is our rage . Not exactly a comforting thought . Give it a smack . You what ? Punch it . Why ? That 's what it 's there for . Or d 'you want me to do it for you ? It just feels a bit weird , that 's all . All right , that 's enough ! It 's not exactly putting up a fight . We all need a punchbag . So , who are you , Owen ? Sorry ? It 'd be pretty stupid not to assume that you 're not connected to those two in the black SUV . I dunno what you mean . Bloke in the big coat , cute little Asian girl ? I was watching . Nice website by the way , kudos to whoever did that , although jellied eels ... That wasn 't your greatest idea . I wasn 't that bad ! Pretty much , you were . Whoever you are , you 've royally fucked up my plans . Didn 't want this getting out . What about Dan Hodges , what about his wife and kid ? I 'm not responsible for people 's life choices . Now why did you lot take the body ? Why didn 't you go to the cops ? Because , Mark , they are parochial pigshits whose minds would implode if they saw this . Who are you , Owen Harper ? Is that who you are ? A little kid hiding behind a gun . If you want to know what happens , you won 't find out because of a weapon . Good boy , we 're finally getting somewhere . Now you 're just you . Stripping things back to the core , Owen . Now , we 're just two blokes . Equal . Why did you murder Dan Hodges ? I didn 't . All right , not technically . Did you do it here ? I mean , you let that thing loose on him . The perfect murder . Nothing to link you back to the crime . God , you haven 't got a clue , have you ? Dan wasn 't murdered . He was one of us . Tell me what happened . I can do better than that . Come on ! Hello ? Anyone ? So where is it , Tosh ? So what have we got now ? Nothing . We have no clue where they are or what they 're doing . So , what am I supposed to be looking at ? Wait and see . All this lot with you ? What 's going on ? You 'll find out . I 've never been that keen on surprises . Jack , I ... 'Jack , can you hear me ? ' What the hell are you doing there ? I told you to go home . There 's a text message that 's just come through on Dan Hodges ' phone . 'Charlie Foxtrot One Zero Six Bravo Yankee . ' Seems to be a postcode for a building . One that 's gonna have a Lynch Frost sign outside . OK , I 've got the location . Gwen , we 'll pick you up on the way . People get a text message and they head to a property ? An empty property . So the question is - what happens when they get there ? What the hell 's going on here ? Warm-up . Warm-up ? Who are these blokes ? Same as us . Ordinary blokes trying to find meaning in a world that doesn 't have any . You don 't really believe that ? We 're the dispossessed now , Owen . All the certainties our fathers had are gone . We 're a generation of no faith . In society , in religion ... or in life . All we can do is reduce ourselves to the basics . This is only the warm-up . Come on . Coming or staying ? Five , four , three , two , one ! Get me out ! Nice one , mate . Costs a grand to enter the cage . Whoever stays in the longest takes home all the money . You 're next ! So these guys are paying to put their lives at risk ? The ultimate extreme sport . Too much disposable income , not enough meaning . That 's us . So what about Dan Hodges , Mark ? He wouldn 't come out . Just stood in the middle of the cage and let it maul him . I think he got in there and he realised ... he didn 't want to live enough . He surrendered . None of us could get to him in time . Yeah . And still you all come back . Well , what else is there ? This has to stop . More people are gonna die . How long are we going to keep playing this game , Owen ? You lie , you bullshit and sweet talk . But you are hiding , Owen . Get in the cage . Not if you 're gonna point a gun at me . Do you want me to shoot you ? Lower the gun . And then I will get into the cage . Good boy . What 's the longest anyone 's been in there ? That 'd be Dan Hodges . when you 're up close with it , take a look into its eyes . Open the door ! It 's like looking into the darkest recesses of your own soul . Open the door ! Owen ! I said open the door ! Jack ! Open it ! Owen ? Get off me ! That 's enough ! Help me , Jack , help me get him out ! Owen , come on ... Get a stretcher ! You did this to him . He did it to himself , he had no fear . It 's over now . These creatures are to be left alone . Go back to your lives . Jack ! What 're you doing ? It 's over . THE MAN WRITHES IN AGONY You shouldn 't have . No , really you shouldn 't . I hate grapes . Doctors reckon you can go home . Doctors . What do they know , eh ? I didn 't want saving . You want us to apologise ? For a few seconds in that cage , I felt totally at peace . And then you blunder in . Do you always know best , Jack ? Is that what you believe ? Want you back in work tomorrow . You sure you 'll be all right ? Give us a moment alone , yeah ? Where 's the SUV ? Has it been stolen ? No , we have . They 're stuck in the middle of the Cardiff Blitz ! Toshiko ! It 's our duty to get them out . Open the rift now and the whole world could suffer . Or who knows what will come out ? I love you . It 's a trap to incite total chaos and destruction ! You don 't even know who he is ! He 's our leader . Not any more ! Captain Jack Harkness , 133rd Squadron . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd

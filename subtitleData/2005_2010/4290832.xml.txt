Together , they fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . The battle for our tomorrow starts today . Episode 202 : Automatic for the People v 1.00 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... Whatever happened with the explosion flipped a switch . - You don 't know what you do . - You 're gonna kill me . I love you , please . I love you , John , and you love me . You could fix her , but I can 't let you . I 'm sorry . - I 'm looking for the Connors . - Sarah Connor ? Mr. Dixon wanted to marry her before . Maybe he 's hiding her . If one of them follows you here , you 'll have killed us . You died two years ago . It was cancer . You died . Did you sleep ? What do you do with a guard dog you can 't trust ? What , that one ? I 'd have spent the night talking to him . I think she 's outside his jurisdiction . Just a wire knocked loose , or something . So he says . Bitch is nothing but wire . It 's only a matter of time . - It 's healing quickly . - Quicker than yours . What about the rest of you ? You 're back to normal ? - Things have changed , John . - What things ? You can 't be trusted anymore . Me ? I can 't be trusted anymore ? You risked your life to fix me . That was a very dangerous thing to do . That could upset people . They 'll have to deal with . Not them . What did she say ? Nothing . You should to school . I 'll start on a new place . School ? Really ? You always talk about how english is so boring . I think we could all use boring today , especially you . What about her ? Last thing she is is boring . I 'll keep her with us . So , you 've been sitting in the same spot since you bailed out on english . I figure it must have some kind of redeeming value . You 're in Mr. Hendrickson 's class , right ? It 's Mr. Amidon 's class , weirdo . And , yeah , I 'm third row , second from the left . Right . - And your name is ? - It 's Riley . Way to flatter a girl . Look , Riley , I really ... - I don 't mean to be rude . - Wait , let me guess , you are just way too busy for company right now . Obviously . - Don 't you have somewhere to be ? - Don 't you ? You got 20 bucks ? - Yeah . Why ? - I 'm still hungry . There 's three bedrooms . Four if you count the nursery , and why wouldn 't you ? This one here 's the master suite . I 'll check the electric . So you live next door ? - Where 'd the owners go ? - They 're in Tokyo for a year . Bob 's a last-minute fill-in for his boss . Guy stroked out three days before he was supposed to leave . Don 't feel bad . I met the guy , and he grabbed my ass with his wife five feet away . Not this ass , of course . Car accident . The whole family . Teaching that one to drive . You 're kidding me . I don 't kid about teenagers . I can 't even imagine . - How many months are you ? - Seven . I feel like a whale . - You look great . - I 'm an orca with boobs . There are worse things to be . Do you want to feel it ? It 's cool . Everyone does . It 's crazy , right ? Once upon a time , you were inside her . We move in . As soon as I figure out what to do with all this stuff . We 'll take it , all of it . Mrs. Dixon . I 'm James Ellison , FBI . May I come in ? I 'm not here as an FBI Agent . I 'm here to help you . I found it in a drawer this morning after he went to work . Charlie hates guns . Mich , I 'm home . What 's going on here ? We need to talk . Help ! Check the perimeter . - Greenway . - What ? - What are you trying to say ? Who ? - Stop Greenway . - Who 's Greenway ? - Stop ... Serrano point . The power plant , Serrano point . - Two days . - Two days what ? No , wait ! No , no . He 's from the future . Sent here by John . I assume that 's how he found us . - You sure that 's not broken ? - I 'm sure I don 't care . You heard the guy . Serrano point , two days , stop Greenway . - I 'll handle it . - I 've seen how you handle it . I send you and a land mine to do this , I guarantee someone 's ending up dead . Maybe it 's supposed to . And the other part of that equation is maybe not . Are you coming ? It looks a lot different than I remember . In the future , the Resistance controls this plant ? The battle of Avila Beach . December 8 , 2026 . Humans regain control of Serrano Point from Skynet . It 's a key strategic hold . It 's one of our main sources of power . The guy who died said something about two days . - What 's happening in two days ? - Maybe Greenway will tell us . Maybe Greenway 's trying to sabotage the plant . - You think he 'll tell us that ? - I think he will . All right . Nuclear power plants supply 20 % of the nation 's electricity . But how do they work ? These lovely ladies are uranium fuel rods . And they are hot . We 're gonna start a chain reaction . Nuts . Hot rods make the water boil . The steam spins turbines , and abracadabra , energy . Of course we can 't forget to cool the steam back to water so the whole process can be repeated . Or else we 'll have a massive compromise of the containment system . You know , I don 't like taking on new temps , I will tell you . Still , perfect score on your placement exam . Security clearance . And I did have two janitors call in with some personal emergencies , so ... Come on . Is there a reason you two are so rough around the edges ? Car accident . 'Cause I can 't have any problems in my plant . Car accident . Just stay out of the fuel building without a protective gear on you , or you could get crapped up . That doesn 't sound very pleasant . It 's plant talk for getting exposed to radiation . Then you 'd need a scrub down . You don 't want a scrub down . Sarah 's alive ? In LA ? And these things , they 're not human ? I can 't ... I can 't ... I don 't love her anymore , babe . Not like that . Of all the things you just told me , she seems the least of your problems . You two need to leave this place . It 's not safe here anymore . Where is ? Saint Bibiana . - Saint who ? - Saint Bibiana . It 's the school that I went to , until ninth grade . Well , ninth and a half , technically . 'Cause I got the boot for this . Can you believe it ? So what 's your story ? You look a little ... Oh , it 's just a car accident . - I was teaching my sister how to drive . - Did everyone check out ? - Check out ? - Is everyone okay ? Oh , yeah , we 're fine . We 're good . We 're alive . For now . You 're full of carrots and apples . Carrots and apples ? Yeah , carrots and apples . You know , happy thoughts . I don 't think that 's really an expression . It 's not ? I don 't know , maybe if you 're on a farm . We 're moving . My mom found us a new place this morning . Is it nice ? I don 't know . I haven 't seen it . Are you serious ? She hasn 't , like , shown you any pictures or anything ? She 's not really the picture type . Yeah , I totally know that type . So you wanna come see it ? What , the mystery house ? Yeah , the mystery house . Do you wanna come with me and see it ? Check the cooling pump calibration on the PWR board . It was fine yesterday . We 're less than 36 hours from going online . Check it again . I 'd have a headache too if I had to figure out what all those buttons do . - They 're just vitamins . - I 'm Karen , by the way . Carl . You 're new ? Brand spanking . Just moved here from Texas . Really ? Whereabouts ? - A little town called Elgin . - Near Corpus Christi . I was stationed at Ingleside naval base . Oh , imagine that . Neighbors and never even knew it . I hear there 's a big test tomorrow . The reactor 's going back online ? - Exactly how 's that work ? - Hopefully perfectly . Greenway . A word . - Nice meeting you , Karen . - Likewise . There 's cautious , and there 's just plain paranoid , okay ? We 're going online . Sure as hell not gonna let you stall us . Well , I guess this is it . Sweet . What 's the matter ? Never brought a girl home before ? No . - Well , I wonder where your room is . - I don 't know . Well , let 's go look for it . She can 't be serious . One more , please . I 'll have what he 's having . I 'm drinking tonic water . I won 't have what he 's having . I waitressed for years . On our break , the other girls would smoke and I would ... Play with matches . Study for my computer classes . See how far it got me . So what 's your story , Carl ? How do you end up at Serrano Point ? Started off in the Navy . Served 12 years on a nuclear sub . - Every girl loves a uniform . - My ex didn 't . At least not the one with my name stitched to it . - Bitch . - Affirmative . That 's a good scar . - Got a good story to go with it ? - Don 't know about good , but a story . Hi . I 'm Cindy . I 'm new in town . This looks like fun . Well , Cindy , this may look like fun , but Bob here 's got 50 bucks says he can beat anyone in this bar . Ain 't that right , Bob ? I 'll play you , Bob . You ever played this game before ? - How hard could it be ? - Oh , it 's plenty hard , girl . Let me show you . Now , what you 're gonna do is take this stick and lean over the table . Now slide it through your fingers . Relax , and get a real good feel . That 's right . Nice and easy . Still my shot . Right , Bob ? So the first surgery , they went in , took out most of the lymph nodes . Then they went back in four months ago and cleaned out the rest . Luckily , they were able to go through the same incision . You don 't hear many people with cancer use the word " luckily . " You 'd be surprised . After four rounds of chemo , you say a lot of things you never thought you would . Most of them I won 't repeat . Now I 've gone and spooked you . No . Yeah . It 's okay . You wouldn 't be the only one . In a nuke plant , a guy with cancer is sort of a black cat . Funny thing is 20 years around nuclear reactors , I haven 't been crapped up , not once . Lucky . See , lucky . There you go . You seem like a good guy , Carl . If no one will drink with you 'cause you 're sick , it 's their loss . That isn 't why they won 't drink with me . Somebody just smashed Greenway 's windshield . - Big guy with a crew cut . - Greenway 's got a lot of enemies . He stopped the last reactor test because of safety concerns . If he stops it tomorrow , people are afraid the plant will get shut down and they 'll lose their jobs . He 's concerned about one of the sensor boards in the control room . It 's showing slight irregularities in the coolant pumps . I hacked into the computer and read his notes . His boss is pressuring him to ignore it , says it 's nothing major . But if Greenway 's right , and there was a problem ... The reactor could melt down . Half the state would be contaminated . Skynet wins . But if Greenway stops the test and they close down the plant ... Then the Resistance can 't use it . Skynet wins . They didn 't even leave any pickles . Check the freezer . My God , you 're a genius . How did you know ? What 's wrong ? - It 's my mom . - Is that a problem ? Who are you ? This is Riley . - From school . - Hi , mom . Let 's talk , you and I. Riley from school . You never mentioned her before . - That 's because I just met her today . - Really ? Now is not the time for this . Now is not the time . Well , when is the time ? For me , I mean , to live my life . If you guys are gonna keep fighting , I can leave . No . Everything 's fine . Do you think about the future much ? The future . When you 're out of your house , away from your family . You know , freedom . Yeah , I think about the future a lot . I don 't know about freedom though . Parents are freaks . Yours too ? Look at the stars . What are you doing in here ? This is a restricted area . I 'm looking for the supply room . One lift in the waste barrel area leaked hydraulic fluid . You might as well take care of it since you 're here . Suit up . It can get nasty in there . What is that ? What does that mean ? It means you just got crapped up . Morning . - Did you sleep on the floor ? - Early riser . - What 's that ? - What 's it look like ? Looks like a robot . It 's a robot , big scary man , whatever , he 's for you . To protect you while you sleep . - Do I look like I need protection ? - If you don 't want it then ... No , no . It 's very cool . Thank you . You 're very welcome . So I guess I 'm gonna try to make it to English . What about you ? Maybe ... not today . Can I call you sometime ? This is gonna sound really weird , but whenever you call me the first words out of your mouth need to be the date . Day first , then the month , okay ? And I 'm doing this because ? Because you wanna call me , and that 's just the way it is . See you later then . These are my same clothes . Aren 't they crapped up ? You know , it turns out they 're not . Positive reading must have been a hiccup . A hiccup ? Yeah , sometimes these scanners have a mind of their own . Wanted to make sure you got off all right . Well , all right 's pretty relative , isn 't it ? How 's she doing ? Well , you know , we always thought we 'd raise kids in this house . But you just can 't plan for anything now , can you ? For the road . So what about you , are you gonna leave ? Or does God have a plan for you ? We 'll see . Yeah , we 'll see . Thank you . Good luck . T minus two minutes . Coolant system numbers are within tolerances . Of course they are . Everything is fine . - But yesterday you said ... - Everything is fine . - 16 november . - 20 : 07 . Something 's wrong with Greenway . Are you at his house ? I 'm searching . Sarah , is Greenway there ? Are you telling me that he 's there ? He 's here . 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . And we 're online . Greenway , he 's been replaced by a machine . You heard me ? Greenway has control of the plant , and he 's a machine . You alive in there ? I 'm thinking about what to do . Since when did you do that ? - What 's going on ? - Turbine building . Water valve 's sprung a leak . Go fix it . Where the hell did you go ? Something 's wrong . We need to turn on the water pumps . We gotta cool it down . Everything is fine . Carl , the reactor 's overheating . It 's going to melt down . Please remain calm . You need to talk to Greenway . He 's lost his mind . Code red . All employees must evacuate immediately . He 's unconscious . The reactor 's overheating . - Emergency manual . - There 's no way . Water tank leak . There 's no time . We gotta go . - I found the instructions . - Let 's go , now ! No , no , no ! This is some kind of schematic . NRC emergency . Security code , please . I 'm in the control room . We need help . Sir , I need a security code . This is an emergency . We don 't know what we 're doing . Sir , I 'm sorry but ... Hold it . Stop right there . Are you okay ? Are you okay ? I 'm okay . You 're clean . When we jumped through time , you told me I died of cancer . Yes , 2005 . Am I still gonna get sick ? I don 't know . Is today how it happens ? I don 't know . What am I supposed to do , just wait ? Like a time bomb , am I just gonna go off someday ? I don 't know . Am I ? You have a new friend . Her name is Riley . And you probably creeped her out . When you talk , don 't stand so close . I was assessing her threat level . Well ? Am I safe ? I don 't know . Girls are complicated . About what you said before , about not being able to trust me . Yes ? I don 't have to prove anything to anyone . Anyone . Including you . 16 november . You got it right . What 's up ? Just practicing . Because of this tragic incident , the owners of Serrano Point and six other power plants across the nation are entering into a partnership with my corporation , Automyte Systems . New automated technology we 've developed will be implemented in all control rooms . These sophisticated machines will eliminate the possibility of human error and prevent a major disaster .

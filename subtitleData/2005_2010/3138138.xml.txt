Welcome to the world of " You want , you got " . What 's on the seventh floor ? This place was built to hide a secret . Now we need it to become a fortress . More than a fortress . A trap .

Subtitles : Nathbot Mrs Jackman , your children must be starving . I know what boys are like . Are you hungry , boys ? Would you like some breakfast ? There 's brekkie inside , bacon and everything . Come . You really think I 'm gonna trust you to feed my children ? You have a point . What you don 't have is a choice . You have beautiful boys , Mrs Jackman , and they 're perfectly safe with us . Mrs Jackman . Mrs Hyde . For now . Just so you remember ... Just so you keep in mind what 's coming ... I 'm Mrs Hyde . And , honey ... Just you wait till my husband gets home . In the meantime I 'd offer you breakfast , but the truth is ... We don 't have any . No ! They 're fine , Mrs Jackman . Completely safe in these things . Get them out of there , for God 's sake ! They 're children ! Get them out of there ! Mrs Jackman , we don 't want the equipment damaged . Mummy , I can 't see ! Eddie ! Harry ! There you go , dear . - Give that a minute . - Please . Sit her down . There . That 's better , isn 't it ? Claire ! It 's alright , it 's me . Don 't be afraid . He 's gone . Do you hear me , Alice ? Do you hear me , Alice ? Do you hear me ? Claire ! Don 't look so scared . I 'm not one of them . They don 't even know I 'm here , so ... Then what are you doing here ? How did you get in ? Who are you ? You 're every bit as beautiful as your pictures . He 's a lucky boy , my son . Tom 's mother is dead . Then I must be a ghost . Where am I ? At the beginning . This is Klein Utterson , mark one . There are a lot of secrets here . And they keep them underground . Buried deep below this building . What secrets ? Do you want to know the truth about your husband ? About Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and how they came back from the dead ? I just want my boys . That 's all I want . It 's the same thing . Then of course , I want to know . Good . Claire ? Just wanted to make sure you were alright . They 've unpacked everything . If there 's anything else you want , there 's a phone . Strictly internal I 'm afraid . I want my children . - They 're perfectly safe . - In boxes . Safest place in the world , those boxes . You should probably get back to sleep . They gave you a bit of a hefty dose . Be in your bloodstream for a while . He 's coming , Peter . My husband . And do you know what ? He 'll be coming for you first . Goodnight ... Mrs Jackman . She has a point . I 've seen what he can do . He 's remarkable , yes . But he 's alone . No one to turn to , no one he can trust . Everything he knew has betrayed him . No friends , no home , no hope , no one . Not even Tom Jackman , not even Hyde himself 's a threat , when they 're completely alone . Well , well , look what the cat dragged in . It 's the next stage of human evolution . Hi , Dr Jackman . Cup of tea ? What 're you doing here ? Those people can track you anywhere . I know . Right now , they 're tracking us all over Dartmoor . They just called in another team , sent us straight into a bog . This is Gavin Hardcastle . He 's one of the men who tried to shoot us last night , and bury us in a ditch . I hit him over the head with a bit of wood . Clever old Gavin . He 's got us cornered and he 's calling in the troops . Hardcastle , we 've not got a visual yet . Over . Hardcastle , are you receiving me ? Please restate your last position . Over . So , whose turn to choose a map reference for Mr Hardcastle ? Hardcastle , please confirm your last location . We all seem to be standing in the middle of a duch pond . Over . They 've taken your family , haven 't they ? Yes . So , what we need is the current location for your wife and children . What we have is a man in his shorts in the know . It 's a start , Dr Jackman , we 're not beaten yet . I don 't know what to say . Can I vote very strongly for nothing ? None of you needed to ... I didn 't ... Cup of tea ? Yes , thanks . We 've got the good one ? - There 's only one tea . - Yes , but the one I like . We 've only ever had one tea . I always give you the same . I 'll just ... Kettle . She really likes you , Dr Jackman . She prefers you to Mr Sexy Pants , so there 's no accounting for taste . Mr Sexy Pants can hear you . We 're doing double shifts . He 's awake . What did he say ? It 's a boy . I said it was . I did , didn 't I ? I said . I take it Mr Sexy Pants has made up his mind whose side he 's on . For now . Right , so ... We need to find your wife and family . Knock yourself out . I know what Klein Utterson can do to people . D 'you really think I 'll sell them out to you ? No . Not to me . Where 's Hardcastle ? Probably Glasgow by now , and still running . - Got what you needed , though ? - Yes . What 's wrong with your hand ? Nothing . That 's what 's so odd . Hyde 's got a cut across his palm , he got it late last night . Hasn 't healed properly . But I don 't have it , and I 've never had it . It 's like we 're not sharing the damage anymore . I didn 't know you could be injured separately . Hasn 't happened till now . Maybe he thinks I can 't cope anymore . Can you ? I 'd better . Your suitcase is packed in the hall . And the letter you 're writing is addressed to me . You 're leaving now , aren 't you ? When I get back , assuming I get back ... I won 't be needing this place anymore . Or me . I 'll be gone in a minute or two . You should probably get back to bed , get some sleep . Anything you need before you leave ? No , I 'll be fine , thanks . OK . Good night , Ms Reimer . Good luck , Dr Jackman . Tom ! Tom , what have they done to you ? Tom , can you hear me ? It 's OK . It 's OK , I 'm here . Oh , baby . Oh , God . It 's alright , they 're quite harmless . You 're perfectly safe . What are they ? Syme told you they attempted to clone Dr Jekyll , didn 't he ? Did he tell you how far they got , or how many times they tried ? This is where Klein Utterson made its fortune . These rooms . Drugs created from the antibodies in these poor creatures . - You said you were Tom 's mother . - Yes . You 're not , are you ? You just work here . This is where Tom comes from ! I don 't work here , Claire , I 'm not even supposed to be here . What does that mean ? Tom is not a clone . Then where did Tom come from ? From me , I 'm his mother . He 's a Jekyll . A direct descendent of the original man . Dr Jekyll didn 't have any descendants . Dr Jekyll died a virgin . You 're not making sense ! Come on , Claire , you know how this works better than anyone . If Dr Jekyll is a virgin , then what is Mr Hyde ? Edinburgh in the 1860s ? No birth control and Hyde rampant ? The world is full of the bastard descendants of Mr Hyde . Teeming with them . Split personalities , Siamese twins ... . Tom Jackman is just one of many descendants . But he 's the only perfect one . The only perfect throwback . A chance in a million . A perfect genetic duplicate , generations later . We tracked him yet ? Any word ? Look at that . Birds flying at night . This is like they 're flying away from something , like a fire . Freeman . Is there a fire ? Sorry , what ? In the forest , is there a fire ? Has anyone checked ? I don 't know , don 't think so , no . We would 've heard . Then what 's in the forest ? Why are they flying away ? Why are they leaving ? " Run if you want to live . " Here , look . It doesn 't matter what I type , look . People think Hyde is rage . Or hate , or greed , or lust . But Hyde is far worse . What is he ? What was the first day you knew you could kill anyone ? Anyone at all , if you had to ? The day I first held my children . It 's our oldest deadliest impulse . The need to protect our own at the expense of any other living thing . And we give that impulse such a nice name , don 't we ? Hyde is love . And love is a psychopath . Dr Jekyll loved . In 1864 , he fell in love with a servant girl . That 's her . Alice Cameron . She 's standing at his shoulder . They found themselves a new Dr Jekyll , but it was Hyde they wanted . And to summon Hyde , you need Alice Cameron . They needed to bring back the only woman in a hundred years Dr Jekyll has ever loved . Tom Jackman isn 't a clone , Claire . You are . No . What the hell 's happening with these lights ? I 've just got a text . I 'm real , I have a life ! Of course you 're real . You 're as real as anyone is . But you were a baby in these rooms . You came from here . Grown from the cells of Alice Cameron . You 've dreamed of this place , haven 't you ? You always dreamt of it . No , I have a mother and a father ! Who love you very much . They should . They were chosen for you . What 's happening ? Run if you want to live . What 's happening ? Jesus Christ . That 's not possible . Did somebody do this ? Is this a joke ? He 's in our heads . He 's messing with our heads . Look , the real words are still here , it 's like he 's transmitting . It 's bleeding into everything . That 's impossible . Yeah ? You wanna tell that to the guy who switched off London ? Mr Freeman , you stay here . Mr Syme , no , I won 't . - You get one warning ... - Mr Syme . The devil is coming . The most powerful thing alive on the planet is coming right to our door . And we 've got his missus locked up upstairs . Right now , d 'you seriously think anyone in this room is frightened of you ? Sit down . Give that to me . Give it to me ! You sit down ! You 're not serious . Jesus Christ ! Sorry about that , just ... It just went off . Bloody hell , that hurts ! Sorry everyone , is everyone OK ? Just a stupid mistake , that 's all . If everyone just stay ... You just stay calm . Just stay calm and sit down . I think ... Please , just sit ! If you just stay where you ... What 's happening to the lights ? Is the power going ? It 's your husband . Love has arrived . It 's everywhere ! Oh , my God ! It 's them ! It 's my boys ! Help me ! Oh , God ! Help me ! Your men ... Will they stay ? I 'll round up those who will . I 'll kill those who won 't . Yeah , well . Try and get that the right way round , won 't you ? Most of my staff seem to have taken the night off . Very impressive . How does it feel to be half a god ? I 'm the other half . Sounds a bit Denis Thatcher . Yeah . Drink ? You look bloody awful . I 'm dying . To old times ? To twenty years of lies ? To friendship . So ... Where do you want to start ? How long has this been going on ? Oh , since the beginning . It was my job to befriend you . That 's why we met . There wasn 't a day I betrayed you , it was the deal from the beginning . That 's all there ever was . Your defence is that it was all lies , not just most of it ? I was never lying . We were friends . How can you say that ? Because it 's true , I was your friend . I am ! As it happens , I 'm also my enemy . For God 's sake , Tom , you know me . I don 't like anyone . Except for my daughters . I don 't talk to anyone except you . You 're the only friend I 've ever had ! And look what you did . For God 's sake , Tom , grow up . No one 's who you think they are . Haven 't you learned that yet ? - Learning it now . - People have different sides to them . Sorry , just remembered who I 'm talking to . Is Hyde going to kill me ? I don 't know . Is there a way for me to ... Tell me how you justify what you 've done . Explain to me how you can be forgiven for what you did . Is he ... listening ? Yes . He 's a psychopath , for God 's sake . Aren 't we all ? OK , OK . There is such a thing as the greater good . Hyde is a marvel . The next stage in human evolution , no exaggeration . With Hyde , we could cure every illness known to man . He 's a blueprint for a better kind of human being . To have Hyde back is worth almost anything . And one day , people will understand . One day , people will thank us for what we 're doing right now . Even you , even your family . Even Claire will thank us . There 've been sacrifices along the way , of course . There are always sacrifices . You don 't start out that way , but it 's inevitable . It 's the way things are . Advancement comes at a cost . Sometimes it will cost your friends . But what does that count against the good that can be done ? The greater good ? No . I can justify myself , Tom , because I believe , I do . I absolutely firmly believe there is such a thing as the greater good . Now ! It would kill a normal man . Become Tom again ! Let it kill him ! You don 't have to share the damage . Actually , let him die . He 's dying anyway , he 's ageing to death . That means genetically , you 're separating . You don 't have to physically share the damage . Become Tom again ! Let Tom die ! Oh , God . Shut it off . Shut the gas off . Extractor fans . Now ! What happened ? You said it wouldn 't kill him . It wasn 't supposed to kill him ! He 's dead , for God 's sake ! He 's bloody dead , we just killed him ! What 's the point in any of this if he 's dead ? The gas is at non-toxic levels now , Mr Syme . Keep your mask on . But it should be safe . Keep your mask on , Mr Syme . - Until we can ... - Oh , shut up ! Strange , his ... His lungs are expanded , like they 're full of air . D 'you think he 's faking ? OK , not unless he can stop his own heart . He can . Mr Syme . That 's not air in his lungs . Tom ! Please , don 't let him , Tom . Old friend . We can stop him . What for ? He 's going exactly where we want him to . Tom ? Tom ! Claire ! Christ ! What 's this ? What now ? - Where are the boys ? - In there . They 're in those boxes like you were . I can 't get into the room . Wait . Try this . - How did you get that ? - Just get the boys out of there . Dr Jackman . We have your family ... We have you . It is over . Excuse me , talking to my wife . Claire . We need him again . I 'm sorry . It 's OK . It 's not OK . He 's not OK . He 's you . You 're him . And it 's OK . It 's always been OK . I mean , what the hell ? You bag yourself a handsome doctor , there 's bound to be some tiny bit of baggage . Dr Jackman ! You 'll be kind enough to turn around now . Don 't dim the lights . Not this time . What ? I wanna see it happen . I wanna see you change . Why ? Been over a hundred years , you and I. Did you know that ? Yeah . Well , then ... Don 't you think it 's about time I saw my husband naked ? Just for you . No one else sees this . Not ever . Hello , toots . Hello , sugar . Look at you , Mrs Jackman . Look at you ! Wasted on him , you are . Yeah , well I have been many times . Let 's make that a date . It 's a date . But not for you . I might peek . - I might let you . - Oh , baby . - Dr Jackman ! - Talking to my wife ! Mr Hyde ! Nothing has changed . This is over , we have your family . What you have is six guys with guns . Make it interesting , give me their names . I 'll do ' em in alphabetical order . Move ! Mrs Jackman , get the kids . We 're leaving . Talking at the back ! Something you want to share with the rest of the class ? Tom , I don 't know how to open them . Mummy ? Harry ? Eddie . Eddie , it 's OK , I 'm here . Mummy 's here . Mummy , we can 't see ! I 'm right here , baby . Mummy , please get me out ! What 's happening ? What 's happening ? We have cut the power to the life supports , Mr Hyde . No ! Please , you can 't ! You want to know how long your children have to live , Mr Hyde ? Hold your breath . Switch the power back on . Right now . Change back to Dr Jackman . Why would I do that ? Because we can take Dr Jackman . Then you 'd have my family ! So will you . You 're not having my family ! Tom , they 're suffocating ! They can 't breathe ! It 's me you want . They 're dying ! Now , there 's an idea . Coming down there , boys . Just coming to turn the power on . Don 't want any trouble . Stop ! Or we fire ! Hold your fire . Nobody fires . Coming , boys . Coming at you ! - Have you got a problem with that ? - Nobody fires ! Didn 't think so . Stop ! Stop shooting ! Look at that . Look what you did . This was clean on this morning ! Wanna be careful with those , you could put someone 's eye out . What ? You think that 's enough ? For me ? I 'm Mr Hyde ! Show a little respect ! Colonel Hart , when he 's done , freeze the body . I 'm sure we can find something we can use . Your family will be safe to leave . Someone 's going to kill you for that , Colonel . Then ... I 'll die . Here it comes . Tickles . Tom ! Mrs Jackman . Your children . Oh , God , I 'm sorry , Tom ! Tom , I 'm so sorry ! Are you all right ? Let me look at you . Are you all right ? Yes , Mummy . How do you feel ? Do you feel OK ? Were you scared ? You must 've been so scared . It was scary when we couldn 't breathe . Of course it was . Of course it was scary . But it was boring most of the time . Why did they put us in the boxes , Mummy ? I don 't know . They were stupid men . Stupid , stupid men . They even put you in the wrong boxes . No , we swapped . What do you mean , you swapped ? They didn 't know , but we did . We swapped . You mean , you got out of the caskets ? How ? We didn 't get out . We just got so bored , we swapped . Sorry , Mummy . Where 's Daddy ? Come here . Come and give Mummy a great big hug . But Daddy ? He can 't ... He 's not ... - Daddy ! - I 'm sorry , Eddie ! Eddie , baby , I 'm so sorry . Daddy , why is Mummy crying ? What ? He didn 't share the damage . He let me go . Here I come ! Be the horsie ! You alright ? He 's gone . He 's really gone . I didn 't think it would feel like this . I thought ... I thought it would feel good . Did you know he could do that ? Take the bullets for you ? It wasn 't for me , Claire . It wasn 't for me . It 's over , though . I promise you . You know that , don 't you ? How did you find me ? I know a good detective . I imagine you have questions . I 'm not a direct descendent of Henry Jekyll . This is my father . There 's no question of any connection with the Jekyll family line , bastard of otherwise . Not possible . I 'm not a direct descendent of Henry Jekyll , so where do I come from ? How are your wife and children ? They 're very well , thank you . And you ? I still have three bullets in me , but I seem to have healed around them . The legacy of Mr Hyde . The legacy ? You think it 's over , don 't you ? You don 't even know how it began , not really . And it 's never over , Tom . Never , ever . I need to know where I come from . I need the truth . I need to know why you left me at a railway station . Why you had to protect yourself by rejecting me . Your father was a good man . A very good man . I miss him . But he wasn 't a Jekyll . A good man until the day he died . What did he die of ? What killed him ? I expect I did , I must check . What ? Tom , you still don 't understand , do you ? What do you think I 've been fighting all this time ? You should know . You didn 't get the curse of the Jekylls from your father . You got it from me . Hello , darling . How smart you 're looking . What 's wrong , sweetie ? Don 't you have a kiss for Mommy ? Come on , sweetie , kiss for Mommy . Kiss for Mommy ... A kiss for Mommy ...

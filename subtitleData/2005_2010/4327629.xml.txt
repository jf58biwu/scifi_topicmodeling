 - Gary ! - What ? ! - Phone ! - Fine ! Have a cow , why don 't you ? - Atomic comic collection connection ... - Shut up ! I know . - What are you doing ? - Working . Hang on . Atomic comic collection connection . Your on-line ... - 21 , this is The Monarch speaking . - Boss ? Holy crud ! I got 24 on the other line . I 'll put us on three-way . Good . I want him to hear this , too . - Dude , it 's The Monarch . - Hey , boss . How 's prison ? Well , I 'm out . No thanks to you schmucks ! Guess where I am now ? - At a good friend 's house ? - At a Best Western ? I am sitting in the charred remains of my once mighty flying cocoon . Anyone wanna explain to me why my cocoon is charred ? Because you told us to destroy the cocoon ? - And why it is sideways ? ! - We were following orders ! - You can 't yell at us for following orders ! - Or kill us for following orders . Never mind . Just summon the others and get over here . There are no others . Yeah , most of them joined up with Monstroso 's crew when you went inside . And we kinda lost touch after that . I 'm not gonna lose my temper . All right , here 's what is going to happen . I 'm going to take a shower in what is left of my bathroom . When I get out , I expect you to be here . And I expect this cocoon to be fully manned and fully operational ! - Awesome . We are back , dude . - You heard him . I 'll pick you up at 5 : 00 . Be outside . I don 't want to have to talk to your mom . I will be there . Daddy 's home . Quit honking ! I heard you the first time . Lady ! Lady , no ! Mom ! Call the dog ! The Grand Cooley Dam ... the largest concrete structure in the United States . Whatever . Do they really need to know this ? Happy fifth ... Happy 16th birthday , boys . Blow out your candle . Here , boys . Put these in your wallets . You 're official now . - How come they 're all burned up ? - Laminating accident . - They 're still good though . - You sure ? ' Cause this date is wrong . - If I was born this year ... - Curiosity kills more than the cat . Put them in your wallets , like the man said , and get dressed . We have a big day ahead . Are you the bully of your school or even the victim of bullying ? Do you watch movies about costumed heroes and think ... " That guy 's a pussy . I sure hope a much cooler bad guy kicks his ass . " - It 's like you 're reading my mind . - I am not a mind reader , stranger . You , like so many others , are drawn to the sexy action-packed lifestyle ... of the professional henchman . But I could never be a henchman . I am just a normal guy who is between the age of 18 and 30 ... a loner , and lacks ties to friends and family . You , stranger are the perfect candidate for costumed aggression . Yo , fat boy . We get to carry a piece ? But of course ! Your standard Grade One henchman ... in service of the mighty Monarch is issued a dart gun and a grappling cannon ... to name only a few of the exciting accoutrements ... that will aid the henchman in his wondrous world of career henching . What kinda ride we get ? How does an enormous flying cocoon sound to you ? A flying cocoon ? I can already feel my life getting better ! The mighty Monarch Around the world No way . Are we floating ? - Hey , boss ! - Welcome back ! - You actually did what I told you ? - Yeah . We are up and running . The new guys stole some parts from Sergeant Hatred 's hover tank ... which is cool but broken now . So there 's a couple of issues . Let me do this . You know that 21 and I have been working for you for , like , ever , right ? And we think it 's about time we were given new numbers . - Like one and two . - Or two and one . - Fine , whatever . - Yeah , like it 's that easy . No , listen to this . Henchman 28 ! Front and center ! You want me ? You roll your big ass over here ! And I 'm done told you my name is # 1 ! I like that ! Shows initiative ! Seems like you collected ... the perfect team of go-getters to carry out my brilliant new plan . Operation / Get Back Dr. Girlfriend ! # 1 , it 's time you met your leader ! The Monar ... What the ? ! Get that off your head ! I smell weed . Can 't you give me just a little hint ? And ruin the surprise ? No , sirree Bob . I wish I was you . This was a big day for me when I was your age . - Hi . May I help you ? - Yes , you may . I would like to fit the lucky birthday boy for his first speedsuit . Great . And what is a speedsuit ? What is a speedsuit ? Only the perfect habiliment for the science-minded man ... who knows both comfort and ease and demands them from his clothing . In a speedsuit , you say to the world ... " Look out ! I know what I 'm wearing for the rest of my life ! " That 's a short-sleeved jumpsuit . Check the workwear department in the back . - My big surprise is a jumpsuit ? - Speedsuit . I don 't want to hear you ever say jumpsuit , Dean , not ever . Speedsuit . There she is ! Follow her ! Steady . Steady now . Keep your distance . Yeah . Fly casual . She 's standing around . Quick ! Evasive maneuvers now ! - Something wrong ? - No . I thought I forgot something . Of course . I look like Santa 's magic janitor . Nonsense . You look like a million bucks . And you were right . The pipe main seams on the explorer model were too showy . This one is elegantly understated and the color has a dancer flair to it . - How does it fit in the seat ? - Pop ! There are people around ! You 'll want a sleek profile yet roomy . A properly fit speedsuit should crotch ... at least six inches below your natural inseam . - Can I take this off now ? - How is everything going ? - Will you be taking that ? - No . Yes , ma 'am ! And don 't bother wrapping it up . The future super scientist will be wearing it out . Magnificent . Finally someone who understands that serration is only good for bread . That is so great . You know how we shall celebrate ? Yes ! Dinner party . I will begin a marinade tonight . We shall invite Manta Claus and Animus . No , wait . That 's awkward . Phantom , honestly . I am finding this so hard to care about . You have to feel the heft to really appreciate it . Shopkeeper , the lady would like to inspect the WÃ¼sthofs ! Well , I 'm gonna get a nosh . You coming ? And suffer the embarrassment of not having enough pickle forks for the party ? No , my queen . There is much to procure . - Because mine got broken , that 's why . - Jeez . - How did that happen ? - I don 't know , Hank . Probably when somebody was playing with it . Go on ! - Come on with that ! - Sorry , sir . Yeah , keep walking . He crept away ! Hi . I forgive you . - What do you think you 're doing ? - Butterfly kisses . Learned it in prison . What , are you gonna pretend that we just accidentally ran into each other ? You know , do that " Fancy meeting you here " routine ? ! No ? I guess ... Could it be that you were tailing me in a gigantic floating cocoon ? By the way , tell 24 that the cloak mode doesn 't work in fourth gear . See ? We need you ! Come back ! Everything is crazy ! The henchmen cry themselves to sleep at night . I think the cocoon is probably really ... busted , I don 't know , I can 't even tell . There 's ... there 's just so many buttons . So many buttons ! - Cut to the chase , Monarch . - Don 't you want to console me ? Why do you want me back ? Because your tree fort is falling apart or because you love me ? Because I love you ! Because ... Because when I 'd lay my world-weary brow on your perfect breasts ... and feel the phlegmy rumble of your chest as you told me , " This is heaven " ... I believed you . You can 't do that . When you threw me out , I was devastated . I would have come home if you asked me to . Yes , I 'm that stupid . But you didn 't . You called me a whore ... and you went back to your I 'll-get-you-Dr . - Venture shenanigans . - Boss ? - What do you want ? - Code blue ! - I want you to grow up ! But it 's late now . - You 'll never guess who just walked in ! - Who ? - You know damn well I 'm staying ... - Dr. Venture . - Holy crap ! - What do you want us to do ? - Move in ! - What ? Move in with me ! Do you want me to share the bedroom with you ? No , don 't be an a-hole ! I was talking to ... I was talking ... You were talking to who ? To your henchmen . I don 't believe I was falling for this ! You haven 't changed at all ! Let me tell you something about Limb . He 's an animal ... Does he know this channel 's open ? Who gave him the map ? What the ... is up with this female ? Ease up on him . He 's been through a lot . The man 's heart has been broken . I am leaving ! Call me when you can act like an adult . I am an adult ! - Let me go ! - Please , just let me ... - Come on , Monarch . - Stay for me . Get your hands off of me . I 'm getting tired of this . Monarch , unhand her this instant ! Come on ! You ! # 2 with fried rice , get down ! There you are . We 're almost ready . Just had to swing by the Shoe Shack . I spotted the perfect Italian ankle boots to complete Dean 's ensemble . - Don 't say it . - You look like the Mayor of Candy Land . It 's an ambush . Boys , get back ! Can you read my mind ? Do you know what it is that you do to me ? Here I am like a kid out of school . Holding hands with the goddess . I 'm a fool . Son of a ... God ! My glasses ! Where are my glasses ? Where are my glasses ? Has anybody seen ? Excuse me . Oh , my God . Thank ... What 's going ... I 'm gonna throw up . Only one shot at this . You can do it , Duffy Moon ! What the ? You want some of this ? Damn you , Nerf ! What the hell was that ? No ! S ... ! Mall cops ! Henchmen ! Retreat ! I won 't let you keep her , Monarch . Hello . What 's this ? What the ? You 're probably wondering why I haven 't killed you . I 'm wondering where the hell I am . The lair of the Phantom . Behind these modest walls ... lies the most technologically advanced system of controlled evil in existence . You , sir , are sitting smack dab in the middle of location " B " ... for the Guild of Calamitous Intent ! You like doing that , don 't you ? Yes . Next to the " Behold a giant walking death ray " speech ... the " Welcome to hell " speech is my favorite . No , don 't get up . You 've been shot . Sadly , it wasn 't fatal . I have removed the bullet . And three others . A blowgun dart , two shark 's teeth , the tip of a bayonet ... a twisted paper clip , and a meager handful of buckshot . - You may want to learn how to duck . - In a couple of minutes ... I 'm gonna get up and pound your smug face into that armrest . So why don 't you spend your last minutes of life telling me what went down ? It seems that our mutual pest , The Monarch , has himself a death wish . He operates in full costumed aggression without a Guild license . His henchmen are using Level 5 offensive weapons for a Level 1 threat ... no offense to Dr. Venture , and he 's kidnapped my girlfriend . - So , what are you gonna do about it ? - Not me . We . I left out one small detail . The Monarch also kidnapped your entire family . The most reckless , graceless exhibition of henchmen that I 've ever seen ! You think you 're all a bunch of hotshot young Turk 182s , don 't you ? Well , there are rules in this business ! It 's about finesse . You don 't just go in , guns a-blazing , willy-nilly . Where did you get real guns anyway ? Are those standard issue ? Hand them over ! What , is this funny to you ? I said hand over your firearm , or I 'll be forced ... Wait a minute , hold up ! - Who are you ? ! - Keep up ! Where are you parked ? - Where am I what ? - Where 's your car ? - I don 't have ... - We came in our bodyguard 's car , why ? Because my ex-boyfriend , the idiot , kidnapped your father and Brock ... and probably my current beau . And you two are gonna take me to him , now ! Yes ! Wait ! How do you know Brock ? Here it is ! - Aren 't you gonna ? - Hank , you drive ! - I never drive mad . - Brock would never let us drive his ... Don 't be such a candy-ass , Dean . Get in the back . - How do you know my name ? - You heard the woman , candy-ass . Wait a sec . OK , get in . How do you know all this stuff , lady ? ! I number two 'd for Truckulese when I was first starting out . I can hotwire anything . No , I mean how did you know it was gonna ... Ten o 'clock . Two o 'clock . You can do this , Hank . That pedal on your left , that 's the clutch . Put your foot on it . Now shift into first gear . See that little diagram on the knob ? With that little one on it ? Wait a minute . Are you our mommy ? Nice . It 's unbearable . First , a mutiny , and now ... I can 't believe I 'm sharing the same air as my sworn enemy ! And I can 't even breathe ! I 'm drowning in my own hate ! God , what is it with this obsession of yours ? - What did I ever do to you ? - How dare you ? ! As if you ... - Frankly , it 's beginning to get a bit old . - And then to belittle my ... These two ! I would love to smack that smug ... Oh , my God , guys . Chill , chill ! If we 're gonna get out of this alive ... you two are gonna have to put aside your differences and work together ! Now , I think I got an idea . If we can get our hands on some weapons , we can totally take these guys . Yeah . No , duh ! But if , just if , we weren 't locked in a cell or haven 't you noticed ? The armory 's on the other side of the cocoon ! - We 'd have to cross the Throne Room . - Where those guys are . Those scary guys . OK . We don 't even need the armory . I 'm talking about my own personal stash . And we happen to be standing right under my room . Trust me . We can climb through the air ducts . - There 's no way you 're fitting in that thing . - Yeah , no . You 're just too heavy . - What the hell is that ? ! - Muscle growth accelerator . Just a little nostalgic item from back when I was a scientific goody-goody . Not unlike your Dr. Venture . No , wait ! I was good at it . What is it with you dicks ? The minute an experiment messes up ... you sell yourself a pair of tight pajamas , and become a professional pain in my ... - Turn that down ! - Deal with it , tough guy . And I don 't need a clumsy bully making a mess of this . If this little incident gets out , my career is done for . This will be handled surgically and quietly . Yeah , we team up like Scully and Mulder and solve mysteries . Been over this . I know that you love playing make-believe but a lunatic has kidnapped my family ... and I 'm going to do something about it ! Not without me . - There we go . - " Good call on the WD-40 " ... said The Monarch grudgingly . - Never go anywhere without it . But thanks . - I have to admit , you proved us wrong . Yeah , yeah . Keep laughing while I totally emancipate you . Gentlemen , choose your weapons . - Is this them ? - " Are these they ? " - Who talks like that ? - Out of the way ! I am the leader here ! I will distribute the ... - Are these they ? - Yeah . And you have to admit it is a pretty formidable collection . You ... ing idiot ! What the hell are we supposed to do with this crap ? Make them laugh so hard they blow malt liquor out of their noses ? No , I think you 'll have that covered ... when you storm the room in butterfly costumes . Nice onesie , Dick . Does it have snaps in the back , so you can make poopies ? This is a speedsuit , mister . Not a onesie ! Maybe they 'll think you 're a three-year-old with progeria and take pity on us . - In your face ! - Would you stop that ? ! Look ... this is extra-amusing and everything , but we 've got us a cocoon to take back ! - With toys . - Toys schmoys . Check this action . An official , licensed / Lord of the Ring replica sword . Now we 're talkin ' ! What are you doing ! ? That is mint in box ! Not even a scar ? Did you look around the nipple or the belly button ? - Sometimes they put ' em in through there . - Look , she is all woman . I 've explored every inch of her and I found only nectar . All right , fine . Maybe The Monarch 's just better equipped . You are strapping on an ultra-light gyropack . They 're only issued to top-ranking Guild operatives . - No , I mean better ... equipped . - She was kidnapped , all right ? ! - Kidnapped ! - I 'm just sayin ' . - Are you ready ? - How do you ? Up , down , side , side . Ready weapon . Left hand , operate speed and targeting . Just like a helicopter . - Just like my kind of helicopter . - Let 's go . I thought for sure you were going to hit me with lock and load . The night is still young ! Left . Turn left . - I 'm driving ! - Yes , we know . Mommy , how do you know where to go ? I 'm not your mommy ! And I put a tracer on The Monarch ... when we were first dating . Hank , take this right ! I 'm driving ! I 'm a driver ! We know ! Yeah , tracer . You do stuff like that when you date Supervillains . Where 'd you put it ? Is it in his brain , or is it like a secret tracer tooth ? I hid it in my mouth and I jammed it up ... Honey , like I said ... you do some pretty strange things when you date Supervillains . I 'm still keeping this thing . It 's the first net cannon I 've used that actually works . - They usually just mess up the guy 's hair . - Prototype . I 'll get you more net cartridges . Thanks . That killer hand is pretty cool . Can you get me one of those ? That 's all me . The outcome of a botched experiment that made me evil . I so called that . So , we done here or what ? It 's just those guys over there . I want them to show you that twin double roll thing . You 're mad , sir . It can 't be done without a trampoline . Wait . Let me do this . You 'll love this . Follow my lead . Classic . Oh , sweet mercy ! I 've been rend asunder by your violence ! Be merciful and finish me off . Have a heart ! Put one between his eyes ! My God ! Do I have to do it ? Give me those guns ! Well met . You do that with his own finger . - Yeah , it 's just one guy . - You show-off . My car . I just fixed that ! - My queen ! - Brock ! - Brock , I drove ! - Boys , you 're all right ! This is a joke ! What the hell is going on here ? Where 's Doc ? What do you want me to do ? Read their fortunes ? They are / Magic : The Gathering cards , not Tarot cards . You can fuzz ' em at their heads . You catch a corner with one of those and they 'll know what hit them . We 'll get our asses kicked . We didn 't have a breakfast . Gentlemen , it 's time we take back the cocoon . Hands in the center . Who would like to lead us in prayer ? Smash puny humans . Did you hear something ? On three . One , two ! Three ! Well , his vital signs seem to be fine . You told me you never put a tracer on another man before . Glad I wasn 't the first one through the door . - Who are all these people ? - Are they all mommy 's other boyfriends ? Stop calling me your f ... mommy ! Come on , don 't kill them . From what I 've gathered , The Monarch is only guilty of poor judgment ... and not being able to get over me . As you wish , my queen . He is only a man ... and no man is immune to your charm . " No man . " I 'm still lookin ' for scars on her . What ? I 'm a Supervillain . / Qu 'ils mangent de la soupe !

 - You want me to go out there and do that ? - Check out this site . Go ahead . Where is he ? ! - Where is Venture ? - Venture ? Dude , no , stop ! There 's been a mistake ! What now ? This isn 't the secret Venture compound . It 's your accountant 's office . What ? Are you kidding ? That was , like , my best entrance ever ! It was excellent . - Very impressive . - This sucks ! Wrong address . Wrong address . Everybody back in the cocoon . - Should we ... - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Take the pens and the Post-its and some , copy paper . You always need copy paper . And get that security tape ! I want a Quicktime of my minty-fresh entrance ... posted on my homepage by tomorrow ! Who 's a pretty pussy cat ? Who 's a pretty , pretty pussy cat ? Yes . You are . No , no ! Just calm ... Don 't ! OK , fine , go ! Just go ! Mr. Venture , you 're back . How was Japan ? Fan-freaking-tastic . How 'd you know ? - Call it a hunch . - Is that what you call it ? No . I call it an Oni . Actually , a Japanese demon . So you can see it . Thank you ! Brock said it was the diet pills . Can you get rid of it ? Yes , yes . I have just the stuff ! These Oni are usually after some form of retribution . So what did you do ? Violate a sacred temple ? No . Let me guess . You relieved yourself in someone 's zen garden . Here we are ! One demon extraction coming right up ! What the hell ? - Wily one , this demon of yours . - Damn it ! Perhaps we should have snuck up on it . Nice . It was perfectly content to just tag along until you pissed it off . Surprise ! You don 't know what the hell you 're doing . The Tempest Tongs should have worked . I must consult a higher power ! Wait here while I go to my daughter 's closet . OK . I 've reviewed the video of the attack on Venture . What happened ? Why did we suck ? How can we not suck in the future ? One answer pops up every time . Weaponry . 21 ? Gentlemen , I give you the Peda-Blade ! Two razor-sharp blades menacingly attached to ... not the end of a skinny arm ... but the end of a long , fat leg ... giving us both the reach and the edge ... or should I say / two edges ? But we raided the wrong address ! We need real planning , not ... What ? Figure skates ? Look . I am trying . This is really tough . I know I 'm not Dr. Girl ... - Do not say her name ! - Forgive me ... but zee problem is one of planning , not one of armament . Mr. Zee Monarch already has a dazzling armory . What he needs is a strategist . A man of his prestige cannot simply go after an enemy all villy-nilly . He can 't give an enema to free Willy ? What ? Shut up , 21 . You might learn something from this guy . What you need is a second in command ... who understands the intricacies of organized villainy . - Zis I could offer you . - Perfect ! You 're hired , Number ? Number Killinger , Dr. Henry Killinger . And this is my Magic Murder Bag . Come on , Deano ! You are , like , the worst wheelman ever . We 're actually moving slower than when you were parallel-parking . Gun it ! Look for some jumps ! Try to get her up on two wheels ! Get something cool going , will you ? Don 't distract the driver . - Ten and two , ten and two . - Hey . What 's that up ahead ? I didn 't know we got that much traffic inside the compound . I get it . I 'll bet Brock set this up , you know , to test us . OK , Mr. Handbook , so what do we do ? We should pull over to the shoulder . I 'll set up the road flares and try to flag down a state trooper . You see if anyone 's been injured . Wait ! K-turn . Hank ! Roll , Hank ! Tuck and roll ! Protect your limbs ! Will you come on ? Holy smokes ! Hey , lady . Are you OK ? Don 't move her ! You 're not supposed to ... See ? Master ? ! Master , are you here ? I have need of your counsel . Orpheus , you 'll love this . Check me out . I 'm Catherine the Great 's horse ... to teach you a lesson about biting off more than you can chew . My partially lovely assistant , Miss Manyface , will play the part of Catherine . - Hi . - Enough with the chatter . Get under there . Don 't wince ! Master , far be it from me to question the relevance of your symbolism ... but I 'm fairly certain the whole horse thing was an urban legend . What do you think ? Pretty sweet , huh ? - This floor totally lights up . - If you don 't mind me saying ... you seem to be a tad overstaffed in your control room . You could reassign ... Say no more ! You 're right again , # 2 . Him and ... the dead guy next to him . This place is all creepy since that mumbly guy just magically showed up . Totally ! And those new Black Guard dicks ... took the / Tekken 3 game out of the lounge ! Those guys are wicked spooky . How unfair is it that they get the cool uniforms ? - I 'm still wearing an orange jerkin . - Jerkin ... One of you little chatter bugs want to pop open the Venture files ? Killinger needs to be brought up to speed . - Yeah . Those files are classified . - By whom ? By you . OK . Great . Well , now they 're unclassified . Boys ! Where the hell ? Boys , come in . You seen the boys ? They were supposed to be practicing for their road test ... but looks like they forgot the car part . What are you guys ... into there ? Orpheus is making me follow that magic head thing I told you about . We 're very close to divining its will ! He 's got you doing it now . You guys are cute together . I 'm gonna go look for the boys . Story of my life . It stopped . It seems interested in this automobile . Tell me . Is it associated with some recent sin of yours ? I wish ! I can 't remember the last time I got lucky in that car . Unless you count the dollar I found under the seat . Can 't see why the beast would want ... What are you doing ? That wasn 't so hard , was it ? Problem solved . No , Mr. Venture . You 're still bound to the beast ... by the gossamer , invisible threads of psychic ... Mother of God ! Help ! I suggest we get in and see where it takes us . What if it wants to go back to Japan ? Zee Venture problem is very volatile . Ve must approach it with caution ... but first ve need to address our domestic issues . The floating cocoon is in bad need of ... The cocoon 's fine . I think the problem is you . He 's right . Yeah . Everybody just thinks you 're so great , but you 're just so not ! - Who do you think you are ? - Come on . This guy just waltzes in here with his huge baby-bearing hips ... and he starts changing everything . Zat 's not fair . I never chose my build . I can 't believe you guys are falling for this sheep in wolf 's clothing . He 's trying to destroy us from the inside . How can you not see that ? Nobody talks to my hot , new # 2 like that ! Black Guards , bring him to the Chamber of A Thousand Torments ! There you may deliver torments 1 through 980 . Killinger , I 'm gonna let you do torment 993 ... 'cause you seem to have bigger thumbs than me . Forgive me , but your methods of discipline may be too Draconian . Give me a moment along vith Mr. Henchman # 24 . I know I can change his mind . Vait . I almost forgot . My Magic Murder Bag . We 've stopped . - What is this place ? - A cheap motel . Perhaps it wants us to stay here and rest until morning . Wait . I know what you 're doing . You 're trying to get me in the sack ! I beg your pardon ! No wonder nobody but you can see that head . How dare ? The tights , the jewelry , always tagging along . " Let me get my big gay cloak , and I 'll join you ! " - I 'm trying to help you ! - Help me out of my speedsuit . Jock Rock my ass ! Listen to those lyrics , man . It 's all about love and longing . Yes , and hobbits , too . Look . It 's a metaphor . They wrote about a lot of other stuff . Why am I arguing with a robot ? Right up ahead . Don 't think we 're done talking about this . Oh , no . Thank God . Crap . Myra 's back . Well , isn 't this new and different ? - Hey , Dean . - What ? - I smell pee-pee . - Well , what are you looking at me for ? Dean , did you get pee-pee scared again ? No . Shut up . Where are we this time ? Hush , little darling , don 't say a word Mama 's gonna buy you a mockingbird OK . That is creepy . And if that mockingbird don 't sing You 're up . You can relax . The nightmare is finally over . No , it isn 't . Hanky , my little , snotty-puggy-dinky . Dean , Dean , Dean , Jimmy Dean , Jimmy Dean sausages . You 're safe now . You 're with mommy ! I have to bring the prisoner his medication . - Give me the medication . I 'll do it . - OK , but ... you have to administer it to him . It 's a suppository . You know , it 's up-the-butt medicine . Oh , don 't knock or anything . It 's not like I live with eighty guys and no women ... so there is no chance I 'm masturbating . Chill . I thought I was rescuing you . What did he do to you ? What 's in his Magic Murder Bag ? Dude , have you even talked to him ? He 's great ! He 's like Mr. Belvedere . He knows nothing about honor or living by the sword . - He 's not like us . - What are you talking about ? Seriously . That Killinger guy has brainwashed the whole cocoon . Man , will you just talk to him already ? He 's amazing ! He cured my herpes . I bet he could even help you with your problem . He 's already got to you . Don 't touch me ! Stay back . - Stay back , pod-person ! - All right . Whatever . You 're not our mom ! - You just can 't be ! - On account of the crazy . Search your feelings , boys . You know it to be true , so true . Funny how it seems always in time but never in line for dreams . OK . We 're losing her again . I bought a ticket to the world , but now I 've come back again ! If you 're supposed to be our mom , then why you got us tied up ? People only do that when they want to kill us . Or hold us for ransom . - Or touch us inappropriately . - What ? When ? That never happ ... Sergeant Hatred ? What ? Did you block that out ? Wait . You were passed out from the wine . Most of it was awful . Trust me . This is no life for my sweet boys . I would have never , ever ... Rusty , why have you forsaken me ? ! Have I ever told you how mommy and daddy met ? Eat web ! What are you ? Black Guards ! He 's covered my Magic Murder Bag / mit silly string . You can silence me , but there will be others . / Semper fidelis tyrannosaurus ! It 's / " Sic semper tyrranis .

Your father ... I spent 24 hours a day with him . First , there were casual glances ... the occasional brush of the hand , clever innuendo . It was inevitable . Something would happen sooner or later . Then the pleasure stopped ... No , no . It was not ooky ! It was the most wonderful , passionate night of either of our lives ! And nine months later ... you two perfect wet , little pink kittens came into the world ... from out of my body . Oh , double eww ! I just didn 't know what else to do . He 's taken over the whole cocoon ... and you 're our last hope . Oh , this ? This is the new Monarch Mobile . That 's how bad it 's gotten . It doesn 't even burn nitrous .

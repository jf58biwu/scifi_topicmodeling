 That 's very good , sir . A very good sign . I don 't have time for this , do I ? Two problems . We 're venting atmosphere from a damaged shuttle , and even if we could seal it off , the life-support system in this ship is past its expiration date . We 'll build up CO2 to lethal levels within a day . Well , that explains the headache . You already had one . They 'll find a way . That 's what these people do . Well , most of these people aren 't even supposed to be here . How did the ship get damaged ? We don 't know . It certainly looks like it 's been through a battle , at least the parts we can access . We 're still cut off from most of the ship . It 's huge . They tried jamming something into the shuttle doorway to keep it open long enough to let the person inside get out ... But it just opens again . Some sort of safety mechanism , like an elevator . Rush says he can 't override it . How long do we have right now ? As it stands ... Rush says if we don 't get it closed , we 've got just over an hour . Bad air 's better than no air . Guess a day 's better than an hour . Someone 's got to go in there and close this door . My head is pounding . Heartbeat has accelerated . It 's getting harder and harder to breathe , as our very lives are being vented out into space . That is going to get old very fast . This needs to be documented . No one 's going to see that . How do you know ? We made it here . Someone else could , too . If we die , maybe this can help them to find out what happened to us . Yeah , well , we 're not dead yet . I 'm starting to have slightly blurred ... Eli ! What ? So how are we going to decide who ? I assume we 're not going to get any volunteers . What 's another day going to buy us ? Time , to find a way to survive . May I see the list ? I marked the names of anyone injured . Right . We have to find out people 's skills , background , experience ... Doesn 't take any special skills to die from asphyxiation ! Look . What I 'm saying is , it shouldn 't be someone with potentially valuable knowledge or abilities we might need to help us survive beyond this . Are you really suggesting what I think ... Half the people on this ship already want to kill you . I don 't care . You can 't ask someone to sacrifice themselves , period . Politicians ask military personnel to sacrifice themselves for the good of others all the time . If someone doesn 't go in there and close that door , we 're all going to die , period . Franklin is still working at the airlock controls locally , but it doesn 't look good , sir . Camile 's explaining the situation to everyone onboard . I 'll do it . Sir ? This isn 't the kind of thing I can ask somebody else to volunteer for . If we 're going to make it past this , we 're going to need you , sir . I don 't know about that . You 're doing a pretty good job without me , Lieutenant . Yeah ? Well , look at the mess we 're in . If that 's not proof that we need you , then ... Look , I 'm not sure anyone should do it . I don 't want someone sacrificing themselves for me . I say we figure this out together while we still have time , or we all die trying . I want you to both listen to me . It needs to be done , and I 'm doing it . Look , sir , you can barely stand . Help me . Look , the paralysis is temporary . Help me . You know that now . You will recover . Lieutenant , I need your help . No , sir . I gave you an order . I know . You can have me court-martialed when we get home , but I am not going to help you kill yourself . My father 's not in his room . We 'll find him . He does not leave this room . He can 't have gotten far . I told him what was going on . Greer , this is Scott , come in . Greer ? Greer , do you read ? Senator Armstrong is missing . He may be headed your way . He 's here . He 's got a gun . I don 't want to shoot you . I don 't think you want to shoot me . Get out of the way . Just give me a little more time . Let me try and fix this . I don 't have much . Guys , I 'm not seeing any change . Whatever you just tried , it 's not working ! The problem 's obviously mechanical . You can 't fix it . Tell me what to do . Dad ! No , wait ! Dad , no ! No ! No ! No ! Open the door ! Open the door , please ! I can 't ! Please open the door ! He was dead on his feet . Dad , no ! I love you . Please open the door . No ! Eli ! Not him ! There 's nothing I can do for him here . Help him ! Open the door , please ! Please ! No . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! He can 't leave me . Chloe . Chloe ! Well , at least he bought us a day . You ! You did this ! You killed him ! You 've killed all of us ! Chloe , stop ! Little help here . Hey , hey , relax . Hey , hey , Chloe . Just get away from me ! All of you ! Miss Armstrong . You 're in shock . Believe me , I understand . Everyone deals with tragedy in different ways . You 're looking for someone to blame . I 'm not looking . Hey , hey . I 'm sorry about your father . I truly am . He was a good man , and he certainly wouldn 't have been my choice , but you must realize , none of this was my fault . I didn 't create the situation that forced us here . There was no other way . Miss Armstrong , I know you don 't want to hear this just now , but this ship ... This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the stargate itself . You know , the Icarus Project was something your father truly believed in . Enough to risk his career to support . What difference does it make if we all die ? A number of people died during the attack on the base . Some of them I knew very well . I 'm sure some had more value than others . As human beings , all of them were invaluable . Look , my point is , I promise you , I will do everything I can to make sure no one gave their life in vain . No one . Please give me a chance . Colonel . We 've lost Senator Armstrong . Oh , my God . He 's bought us some time . To do what ? We 're working on it . First up is trying to dial the gate back home . Should you even be on your feet ? No . Well , I am on my feet , and right now we 're trying to get home . Camile , I need your help . You know these people . I need you to spread the word . Try to keep things as positive as you can . I can do that . Good . I can 't believe my dad is gone . I watched him die , and I still just can 't accept it . Tell me about him . Why ? Man died so I could live . I 'd like to know a little more about him . No matter how tired he was , or how long he 'd worked , or what was going on in his life , he always had time to listen to me . I 'd go on and on . He never preached . He never told me what to do , even though sometimes I wished he would . He would just listen . And then he would tell me that he loved me . The best part was if I 'd had a fight with my mom , he never took sides . Hmm . Oh , God . My mom . He was her whole life . She probably thinks we 're both dead . All I know is that he wanted you to go on . I know . I got to get back to the search . You going to be okay ? I don 't know . Fair enough . Eli ? What ? What are you doing ? I just watched a man die . Okay ? Don 't you even care ? Of course I do , and I 'm also trying to learn as much as I can , as quickly as I can . That is , in addition to running nine separate searches in the database in the hope of solving our life-support issues . Right . Found anything ? Destiny . As in ours ? The name of the ship . Translated from Ancient . I 've also discovered that they were never here . I thought this was an Ancient ship . It is , but they sent it out unmanned , planning to use the gate to get here when it was far enough out into the universe , but they probably learned to Ascend before that time . Learned to what ? Ascension . It 's a process whereby consciousness converts to energy that no longer requires physical form . That wasn 't in the video . Well , there 's more than one video . We should get back to work . Sorry . Sir , I think I got it . It wasn 't even that hard to find . It 's right here in the dialing program . You 're sure ? Yes , it 's an eight-symbol address . You mean you can dial this thing back to Earth ? There 's no point of origin indicated , but still , there 's only 36 symbols on this gate . I 'm assuming the ninth symbol represents some X - factor distance equation . Well , I don 't care . Start dialing . Sir , don 't we want to bring Dr. Rush in on this ? Well , you said this wasn 't that hard to find ? No . Well , then he probably already knows and didn 't tell us . Who is this Lucian Alliance anyway ? Where did that come from ? I just want to know who to blame for this . They 're a human coalition made up from various Milky Way planets , formed in the power vacuum left behind when the Goa 'uld were defeated . They 're criminals mostly . A street gang with starships . How 'd they find out about Icarus ? Wasn 't it supposed to be , like , double secret ? I suspect there was a leak somewhere . Someone working on the inside . The legend surrounding the ninth chevron has been floating around our galaxy for some time now . We found that it meant various things to different cultures . Some said it was a key to the universe itself . And once unlocked , you would gain untold power . Now , if the Lucian Alliance knew that we 'd discovered the address and a means to dial , they 'd want it . This ship is a source of untold power ? No , no , not literally . It 's more to do with what it 's doing . The information it 's capable of gathering . If you know how to use it . Yeah . That 's what you 're after , isn 't it ? Why you risked everything to get here . You think this ship is going to make you all-powerful or something crazy like that ? Eli ... If I could find a way to send all these people home safely and then return with a properly skilled team to pursue this mission as intended , why wouldn 't I want to do that ? I don 't know . Uh-huh . Now turn that thing off . You saw that ? Oh , no , no , no , no . What ? Someone 's dialing the gate . Colonel Young . You 're up . Nice to see you , too , Rush . I did order you to report to me . Yes , but what are you doing ? We 're trying to dial Earth . That would be a mistake . Riley thinks he 's found the address for home . His understanding of Ancient is marginal at best . With respect , Doctor , I know enough to recognize a reference to Earth . He says the address wasn 't that hard to find , Rush . No , no . This is a complete waste of power we may need . We have the address back . All we need is the right point of origin . And we 've got 36 tries . We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial Earth . You see , that 's news to me . He didn 't tell me that , either . Well , I 've only just learned myself , and you know what I 've been doing . Even if it doesn 't work , the people aboard this ship need to see us at least try . So , what , you 're going to drain what little power we have for the sake of morale ? How ridiculous . What was that ? Anyone near the observation deck ? Colonel , it looks like we 've dropped out of FTL . Because we were draining power ? No , no . If I 'm right , the gate should begin to dial any moment . How did you know that ? The ship detected a stargate on a planet within range that may have what we need . What ? How the hell are there even stargates out here ? The Ancients sent out a number of unmanned ships ahead of this one . They 're programed to gather data , resources , to manufacture stargates and deposit them in habitable worlds . Any relevant information is relayed back here to help plot the course . You 're telling me that this ship knows we 're in trouble ? Yes , because I told it we were . Essentially , we 're flying on autopilot . This ship may have stopped when it was within range of a stargate regardless of our need . But I have reason to believe ... So , what we need is on the other side of that wormhole ? An educated guess , yes . There 's only one way to find out . Sir , you can 't do that . We have no idea what 's on the other side . We can use the Kino to find out . I expect that 's the purpose of this device . I 'm getting readings over here . What have we got ? Temperature , gravity , atmosphere composition , barometric pressure . Oxygen , nitrogen , very little CO2 , extremely low humidity . Habitable , but just barely . Good enough . Looks like four other addresses came up here , too . They could be other planets within range . Maybe we should think about dialing them up and seeing ... No , no , no , they 're locked out . The ship chose this one . The stargate is open , all we have to do is step through . What we have to do is put a team together . Dr. Rush . Looks like our time might be limited . What is it ? It 's a countdown . Just over 12 hours left . What happens then ? I suspect we jump back into FTL . Palmer is a geologist . Obviously she should go . Franklin and Brody are the best of the rest of what we have . Thanks for the ringing endorsement . He didn 't even mention me . Franklin goes . The others stay . We 're still going to need good people working on the problem from this end . I 'd like to go . Really ? If I can help , then ... Colonel Young , please . What ? You don 't think I can handle it ? He 's going . I 've been off-world before . You have made a habit out of pulling our asses out of the fire . Eli , you want to go , you 're going . The only one I 'm questioning right now is you , Dr. Rush . Well , besides Palmer , I 'm the only one who knows what we 're looking for . We have 12 hours to find what we need and then get back on the ship . You 're sure you can 't stop it ? No , we 're just along for the ride for now . Then we may all be better off on the planet . Well , that 's another reason why I should go . Someone to assess whether long-term survival there is even an option . Right . Okay . I want everyone clear that Scott is in charge of this mission . Let 's gear up , let 's find whatever supplies we have , and move out . Sir , about Eli ... He volunteered . He 's not trained for this . Just like a lot of people we got on the ship . I 'm going to need to know what they 're made of . He 'll slow us down . Well , if he does , you send him back to the gate . Listen , if we 're going to make it , and I 'm not just talking the next few hours , we 're going to need everyone on board to step up . Lieutenant . Keep an eye on Rush . Think there could be dinosaurs ? Anything 's possible . We 'll be back , sir . Good luck . Hot . Cool . Make sure we can dial back to the ship . Already on it . Looks like gypsum . That would be good . Why ? We 're looking for calcium carbonate . Calcite . Gypsum is calcium sulfate , which is 36 % calcium carbonate . Hmm . Huh . It dissolves . Are you saying we can use this sand to fix the scrubbers ? That would be convenient . No . Well , it 's a fair indication that the components may exist nearby . For the sake of portability and efficiency , I 'm hoping to find high-concentration granular limestone . We are looking for the dried lake bed or salt-water body all this sand came from . It 's a desert . Lime is formed mostly from the remains of marine organisms . Huh . Are you saying there was life here ? Not likely anything we 've seen before . Yeah , the water may be gone now , but this desert was formed by H20 evaporating on a playa floor , causing gypsum to be deposited in a fine crystalline form called selenite . Where are you going ? Higher ground . Is that supposed to happen ? If this sand is high enough in calcite concentration , the solution would absorb the acid . Right . The liquid would turn clear . It 's not . We 're good ! This is Scott . Unfortunately , there 's nothing useful in the immediate vicinity of the gate . You have 12 hours , Lieutenant . Make them count . Copy that . We 're moving out ! Too bad we can 't just use this sand . There certainly is enough of it . James . Yes , sir . I 'm looking for Chloe Armstrong . She 's still in there . She hasn 't come out . How is she ? How is she ? How about asking how I 'm doing ? Well , you 're trained for this , Airman . Give me a ... She just watched her father die . My father may as well be dead to me , too , 'cause I 'm stuck in some galaxy that only God knows about . Yeah . Okay . You know , I was supposed to go back to Iraq again , but they said that this would be a better opportunity . We 're all going to die out here . Hey ! I want you to listen to me . I don 't want to hear that kind of talk . Do you understand ? 'Cause we 're going to work ... We 're going to work this out . Just letting you know how I 'm doing , Colonel . Since you asked . I 'm fine . No , you 're not , and neither am I , but we 're ... We 're still alive because of what he did . Look , for what it 's worth ... Well , it 's worth a lot . You know , as long as we 're still here , I promise you ... Colonel , I 've edited enough of my father 's speeches to know what you 're going to say . You don 't have a clue what I was going to say , because I don 't . We ... We brought along an Ancient device . Communication stones . They allow us to ... Yeah , I know what they are . Good . Well , I 'm about to use one of them to report to my superiors on Earth , tell them our situation . I want to tell her myself . You 've been sitting here since Rush made contact . Let somebody else take a shift . I 'm not leaving this chair . I 've been on this project for the last six months , and I 'll be damned if ... Colonel ? This is strange . Dr. Rush , is that you ? No , it 's Colonel Young . I need you to put me in a room with General O 'Neill . I 'm going to need you , too . Sir , I told you not to get up . What did he do to himself ? He 's got cracked ribs , more bruises than I can count and a concussion that resulted in neuropraxia . Oh , that 's just great . Chloe ? Dr. Mehta . Can you help me , please ? You know , I had some of my favorite arguments with your father . Are you saying you won some ? Depends on who you ask . Listen , Major Green 'll be escorting you to see your mother . Please give her my condolences . Thank you . Yeah . So , how is it going out there really ? I don 't know what Rush has told you . We may not have much time left . The ship 's very old . It 's falling apart . Fix it . We 're trying . Even if we can get the life support working , we don 't have much food and water . Then go get some . We 're not supposed to be there , sir . These are the wrong people in the wrong place , and as a group , they 're just not qualified . Oh , please . I wasn 't qualified to lead that first team through the stargate ... I understand that , sir . In the past dozen years or so , we 've sent hundreds of teams through that thing ... And I think the bottom line is , none of us are qualified . I just think we 're going to get to a point very soon where everyone onboard should get a chance to say goodbye . Understood . Save it . That 's not very smart . Temperatures like these , the human body needs at least ... Walk , don 't talk . Just FYI , he 's right about the whole human body and water ... Eli ! Walk , don 't ... Oh . Look . More sand . This is pointless . We should go back . We just got here . I still think we should be checking out the other planets in range of the ship . I still think you 're wrong . The solution 's here . I know . It was a mirage , but when we were walking over that last dune , I thought I saw the Statue of Liberty sticking half out of the sand . Just for a second there . I was all ready to yell , " Damn you ! " Damn you all to hell ! " Oh , come on . That was funny . Was it ? Because it would mean we were really on Earth , but in the future , and the apes had taken over and then buried the Statue of Liberty for some reason . Eli ? Have a drink . Greer , hold up ! Hold up ! This isn 't going to work . Not if we keep stopping . I 'm saying we need to split up . Fine with me . I agree . Franklin , you should come with me . Nah . No , no , no , you 're with me and Greer . Sun 's been moving that way , we 'll call it west . Eli , Franklin , Palmer , and Curtis , you head that way . We 'll test every 20 minutes or so . After two hours , you head southeast . That should take you back in the direction of the gate . Whoa , wait a second . Do we really think that splitting up is the best idea ? I say we head straight back . There 's no point in crossing over the same territory we 've just crossed . Or we could just stick together . Look , Matt , I 'm sorry . I just have this really , really sick feeling that you 're going to go that way , and we 're going to go this way . Eli , I need someone that I can trust to lead the second team , okay ? That is you . Curtis is a good soldier . He 's a tough guy . He 's not going to let anything happen to you . Truth is , I 'm slowing you down and you want to get rid of me . I 'm doing what I think will best accomplish this mission . You asked to come . I 'm telling you how you can help me . Now suck it up . Yeah . Okay . Okay , guys , we 're going this way . Move out ! Radio if you find the lake bed , we 'll double back . When you see the Statue of Liberty , you know what to say , right ? Right . Now we can make some time . She 's here ? Right now ? Yes , ma 'am , but as I 've explained ... Chloe ! Mrs. Armstrong ... I know I look different and I sound different , but it 's me . Mom , please . I have something to tell you . Mom ... Stop ! I 'm sorry . It 's just ... The thought that you 're actually on some ship so far away , I can 't even imagine . Mom ... Just tell me you 're coming home . I don 't know . Mom , please ! The ship is old and damaged . We were losing air and somebody had to ... He 's dead . He 's dead , isn 't he ? Where is everyone ? Able bodies are searching the ship for anything that might have CO2 sequestration properties , and the rest are in crew quarters . Colonel , we were able to dial out to the planet again . Colonel Young and Chloe are using the communication stones . This is Colonel Telford , Dr. Mehta . Uh ... Right . Okay . Did you make radio contact with the off-world team ? Yes , nothing to report yet . They 've split up . How much time before the ship jumps back to FTL ? Roughly nine hours . Dial out every 20 minutes . Maintain regular contact . We do have power issues to be aware of . Dialing the gate is a significant drain on what seems to be limited resources at this point . The away mission is priority one right now . Sir ? I 'm fine . I understand that there are other stargates in range . Four other addresses came up in the system , but we seem to be locked out from here . Well , have you tried working around it ? Dr. Rush didn 't think that was a good idea . I think it makes sense to know what our options are , so do what you can . There has to be a good reason why these addresses are being disqualified . If I wasn 't being clear , I was giving you an order . If there are good reasons , find out exactly what they are . Let 's keep moving , I want to see more . You should rest . Lieutenant . Sir , Colonel Young 's body needs time to recover . Give me something for the pain . The body feels pain for a reason . I would rather not mask it . Just do it , Lieutenant . From the sound of things , you need my help here . All right , come on . Let 's go . You better save some of that . We need to slow down . We need to cover more ground . It 's going to be impossible to maintain this pace on the way back . Maybe for you . How tedious . Little boys playing soldier . Well , I 'm sorry . I 've no interest in playing your game . I 'm not playing anything , I 'm trying to save the lives of everyone aboard that ship . If we continue this pace , we 're going to die out here . Yeah , maybe we will . Light years away from the admiring eyes of your father , or your drill sergeant , or whoever 's approval it is you so desperately seek . How dare you ! Get up and move . Hey , did you see that ? What ? I don 't know . Nothing . Let 's move . One hour . One hour , and then we start circling back . All right , fine . Just hold that there . Thank you . What did you ... That was supposed to be for the pain . What did you give to him ? A strong sedative , which we are desperately short on and I should not have had to use just so that Colonel Young can return to a body in working condition . You are out of line , Lieutenant . Disregarding the health of another human being is out of line . I am well within my rights as ranking medical officer . He 'll be out an hour or two . Well , what am I supposed to do ? I don 't care . I have other patients to attend to . Something wrong ? No , I 'm fine . Good a place as any to stop and test . I take it that 's not good ? No . I don 't know . I think that ... Hey , guys . Another negative over here . I 'll radio Scott and tell him we 're moving on . Uh , yeah , but that 's not what 's going down . It 's not ? No . There are four other viable addresses in this thing . I think I found an override that 'll allow us to dial from here ... Yeah , but ... Look around . This planet is a dead zone . But ... We should 've been trying to dial these other planets from the start . Rush said ... We don 't care what Rush said . We don 't trust him . Rush doesn 't want us all to die . That doesn 't mean we trust him to make the right decisions . You , too ? What about the lake bed ? It could be hundreds of miles from here . We could be blowing our only chance at finding a decent place to evac . Maybe the ship did bring us here because there 's lime on this planet . For all we know , the Ancients had a way of locating it that we don 't . For that matter , I 'm sure they could 've stopped the ship for longer than 12 hours to find it and recover it with the proper tools . The fact is , the Ancients wouldn 't have let the life-support system get that screwed up in the first place . Rush is set on fixing the ship . He 's deaf to any other logic . We need to find a planet we can survive on . This might be our last chance . That ship jumps to FTL , we could be dead before it drops out again . We 're going to the gate . Give me the remote . Or not . That was optional . Give me the Kino . Isn 't this mutiny ? I 'm not sure that applies on the other side of the universe . Besides , my orders were to keep on searching and then head back to the gate . Are we done ? We 're done . Go ahead and tell Scott we headed for the gate if you want . My radio doesn 't seem to be working . We 'll let you know if we find a planet everyone can survive on . That remote was our only way back to the ship . You 'll have to get another one . Gotta keep going . Here . Take it . I have my own . No , no . I can 't go on . I 'm never going to make it back . I know it 's here . You have to find it . Take it . We 're going to leave him here ? I 'll make my way back to the gate . Go with him . I 'm not leaving you here alone . Make sure he gets back alive . What difference does it make ? Because if I don 't find what we need , he 's going to be the one to find some other way to save his own ass , and yours along with it . You 're losing it . I 'll be okay . Scott , this is Eli . Come in . If you can hear me , please respond . This is Scott , what 's up ? We have a problem . Franklin , Curtis , and Palmer have given up and are headed back to the gate to try dialing the other addresses in the remote . They also have the Kino . They don 't think we 're going to find the lime here . They want to look for another planet that will support life . They 're going to get themselves killed . Don 't we need the remote to get back to the ship ? That 's not the point . A few hours is nowhere near enough time to determine whether a planet is even safe , let alone viable for sustaining life . The ship . The ship 's our only real hope of ever getting home . Stop them if you can . I 'll turn back when I have to . Yes , sir . Go ! You lead . I can 't lose you , too . I can 't . No , you won 't . I 'm going to be okay . Thank you , Martha . Here , Mom . Have some tea . I 'm sorry , excuse me . Miss Armstrong , we better be going soon . You get my daughter home . Everyone is doing the best they can , I assure you . That 's not good enough . Mom , it 's not his fault . I 'm a personal friend of the President and of the First Lady . Yes , ma 'am . You tell your superiors if anything happens to her , I will go public with what I know . Mom ... I 'm sorry , she 's upset . My husband gave his life for my daughter . You get her back to me , or the whole world is going to know what has really been going on these past years . I need water . We 're almost there . I thought since I gave Scott my canteen , we 'd share . And you were wrong about that . I should 've known . Yeah ? You think you know me pretty well , don 't you ? I helped choose the personnel for Icarus Base . I read your file . And neither you nor Captain Marvel back there were on my list , I can tell you . You think I care ? Give me some water . Keep walking . You think just because you were born poor that it gives you the right to be angry at the world . How pathetic . Mmm , yeah , yeah . You think that 's why I 'm angry ? If it wasn 't for the army , you 'd be in jail , or worse . That 's what all you rich people think . Rich ? My father worked in the shipyards in Glasgow . I earned a scholarship to Oxford while I was working two jobs . I have earned the right to make decisions without explaining myself to you or anyone else . You give me some of that water ! Keep walking . You give me some of that water ! Don 't you ever touch me . Give me some ... And you do that again , and I 'm gonna put a bullet in your face . Oh , really ? I don 't think so . You need me . Otherwise , you 'd have gladly done it by now . Right now , I pray to the God above that dehydration will shut you the hell up . Walk ! Or die here ! It 's your choice , Mr. Decision-maker . Looks like it 's worth a shot to me . Let 's do it . Wait ! Stop ! Look , it 's not perfect , but it 's better than here . Vegetation , water , air . It 's not too late for you to come with us . Don 't go . We 'll dial back when we know it 's safe to evacuate everyone . You 'll never get back home . You don 't know that . Maybe there 's a way we can use the gate system to connect the dots . There has to be a reason the ship locked out those addresses ! Don 't . Please . Shoot him ! Why did you do that ? He told me to . I saved his life . By shooting him ? He 'll live . You just stranded Curtis and Palmer . We 'll send them another remote . I wasn 't taking any chances . Where 's Scott ? Still looking for limestone . It 's almost halftime . We only have six hours before the ship leaves . Lieutenant , this is Greer . Come in . I hope he 's turned back by now . Lieutenant ! Come in . You must keep going , my boy . Don 't give up . I don 't need you to tell me that . I 'm not going to let anyone else down the way I let you down . You really don 't have to follow me around to remind me . He has his plan for all of us . He 's either out of radio range or he 's lying face-down in the sand , dead , or soon to be . I 'm going back for him . Well , that 's great . Suicide . I 'm not leaving him out here . I 'll go with you . No , no , you 're just gonna slow me down . Look , this man has to get back to the ship . He needs medical attention . Dial . He can take Franklin back . You wait here for me . You have five hours to find him and get back here . Well , it 's not been a pleasure knowing you . What do I need that for ? Just in case . In case what ? I don 't even know how to fire this thing . You 'd better be here . I will . I have a gun . Why do I feel like I 've been drugged ? Oh . Good to have you back , sir . Son of a ... What the hell was Telford doing ? Well ... You 're going to need this . There they are . Hurry up , hurry up . Come on , help him , help him . What happened ? Greer ... Greer shot him . Water . Water . Hey . That was my ration for the day . What 's going on ? Oh , we 've had a lovely day at the beach .

If you can hear me , please come in . Curtis . Palmer . Please , respond . Do you love her ? She 's not going to have it . You 're certain ? She 's 16 . We barely even know each other . What are you going to do ? I don 't know about anything . I thought He was my calling . But now ... I am sorry . Why ? I 'm the one who 's weak . It 's my fault . No , it isn 't . It 's not yours . This is Scott ! Come in ! I found it . I found the lake bed ! I 've got the lime ! Oh , my God . If you can hear me , wait . Just wait , I 'm coming ! Eli . Which way ? Let 's move out . Scott ... Come on . Ready ? Drink . Come on , come on , come on , man . Take the bag . There 's no time ! You have to take it . Yes , you can . No , I can 't make it . Get the hell up ! Come on !

Come on ! Five , four , three , two , one ! Eli , drink . Scott , look at me . Lieutenant , look at me . Look at me ! Look at me . Well done , Eli . Well done . In the quiet of a shadow In the corner of a room Darkness moves upon you Like a cloud across the moon You 're a-wearing all the silence Look . Of a constant that will turn Like the windmill left deserted Or the sun forever burn So don 't forget to breathe Don 't forget to breathe Your whole life is here No eleventh-hour reprieve So don 't forget to breathe Keep your head above water But don 't forget to breathe I brought you some water . I still have some . You really need to drink it . I 'm fine . Everyone appreciates what you did . Rush say how long it will last ? He 's not sure . How are you ? My parents died in a car crash when I was four years old . I 'm sorry . And the priest who raised me , he pretty much drank himself to death when I was 16 . My God . I 'm sorry . I 'm not trying to diminish what you 're going through . I ... I know . I think my point is , there 's just some things you never get over . That 's just the way it is . You go on through . As best as you can . Don 't forget to breathe Don 't forget to breathe You know you are here But you find you want to leave So don 't forget to breathe Just breathe Just breathe English - US - PSDH

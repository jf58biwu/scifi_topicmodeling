 My condition is unprecedented . Nothing like this has ever happened before . Don 't ! Just stop , just stop now ! Why ? Tell me Daddy , what 's the big deal about Claire ? Oh , Daddy ! I 'm not married to you ! Yes , you are . Get used to it . Klein Utterson exist to follow you . You are its sole purpose . No , for God 's sake , no ! Please ! Claire ! No ! - You have some questions ? - A few , yes . You have my husband in a box ! - It 's Hyde we want . - So who is he now ? How do you know which one he 's stabilised as ? We open the box . Sorry Poole , mislead my keys . Good morning , Dr Jekyll . Subtitles : Nathbot { 7 } We weren 't sure when you 'd be returning . { 7 } Will you be requiring breakfast ? No , I think I 've eaten . I have . I 've eaten . Any messages ? One caller , the same gentleman as before . He said he would call back after ten o 'clock this evening . Gentlemen do not call after ten o 'clock . I could contact the police if you 're concerned . Alice said his manner was odd . I 'll have business with this man . We are connected . He spoke to Alice ? The maid , yes , sir . He came to the kitchen door this time . I 'll talk to her . Is she still in the kitchen ? Dr Jekyll , I could send for her . Alice . { 7 } You had a caller today . He 's coming back tonight . Ten o 'clock tonight . Mr Hyde scares me . Mr Hyde scares me very much . But not half as much as that man and all his questions . " The strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde " . My wife thinks I should throw it in the fire . But my publisher is interested . You called at the house while I was out today . You spoke with the maid . Yes , I 'm sorry . Background details , you know . I have provided you with sufficient details . You 've kept within the limits of what we agreed ? I elaborated for colour , altered for economy . It has the appearance of a fiction , but the substance of the facts . Just as you wished . It lacks only an ending . An ending will present itself shortly . How ? I will die . I can no longer control the changes . I thought you said the potion controlled the changes . At the beginning , yes . Hyde comes when he chooses , now . Each time , he weakens me , reduces me . I can feel it . I 'm sorry . I 'm not . If I die , he dies too . People aren 't stupid . This tale is not in my normal style . There are those , a few , who might suspect its origins in truth ... in a tale of a potion that can transform its hero into a demon . I am not a hero and it is not a tale . Such an account might set some thinking about this potion . There are those who 'd wish to possess such a thing . I know . Then why should this tale be told ? It is not a tale . It is a trap . The secret of this potion , you are certain it is known to you alone ? Oh , yes . You are wrong . It is known to one other . Who ? Me . I only want to know if I 'm right . One never quite knows who 's listening . The secret of Dr Jekyll 's potion . Nothing will appear on my account . You can trust me . You will tell no one . You have my word . It dies with you . Dr Jekyll 's last secret . Oh , Tom . Oh , my God . You 've chained him . Claire ? Claire , be careful . Help me , Claire . I can 't see your face . I can 't move . I need to see your face . I can 't move my head . Paralysis ? No , can 't be . Why have you chained him ? Thing is ... If he 's stabilised as Hyde ... - Well ... - What ? The process would make him more extreme . - Worse ? - Stronger . He doesn 't look stronger to me . Claire . It 's me . Please . It 's me . I can 't move . Our honeymoon . Where did we go ? What ? You heard me . Our honeymoon . Name of the hotel . The Apple Yard . Room 702 . We could see the church ... from the window . The spire . You know what ? I 'd forgotten the room number . Claire . You know what ? Not too close . He hasn 't . The doctor is out ! Security ! Get security in here now ! He 's out of my head , hallelujah ! Home alone . Oh , this feels good ! Roomy ! Look at all this space ! I could put up shelves ! Where is he ? Where 's my husband ? Search me love , he was in here a minute ago . Turn my back and whoosh ! Not even a tip on the dresser . Men ! Oh , this feels so peaceful . Love it ! No more boring little doctor yapping away in the corner . Honestly , you have no idea . " Don 't do this , don 't do that , don 't kill her , your turn to shave " , and if I 'd had one more argument about who was biting their fingernails ... Did that bug you ? The fingernails ? Did he do that when he was with you ? We should talk , you and me ! We 're fellow sufferers . We should have a cup of coffee and a good old chinwag about him ! The wife and the ex . Girls together . All friends now , the bastard 's dead . How can he be dead ? You 're still here . How can he be dead ? Hello again , Mr Hyde . Appreciate it if you kept right where you are . The thing about consuming an alter-ego , bit like a Chinese . A minute later , you 're hungry again . Hello , boys ! Mr Hyde , no one here means you any harm but ... we do need to examine you . Thing is ... Basically , you may not be stabilised yet . It 's for your own good . Basically . OK , Mr Basically . Talk to me like you know me again , in public where people can see , and the next sound you hear will be your own neck snapping . Do we now have a basis for communication ? Mr Hyde . Step away from Dr Gilligan . Yeah . Neckaty-neck-neck . Sorry . Mr Hyde . Please step away from Dr Gilligan . We don 't want to hurt you . I can smell your sweat . Vegetarian . Woof ! You 've got a dog . Two dogs . Big dogs ! I vant to say Alsatian . Is he correct , Colonel Hart ? Yes , sir . He 's correct . Mmm , tasty ! Fifty-seven years-old , ex-smoker . Gave up ... two years ago ? Yeah , two years ago . Two years and too late . It 's started already , hasn 't it ? Rustling a way down there . Growing in the dark . Hello , Mr Tumour . Goodbye daylight . Am I right ? Is he right , Colonel Hart ? Yes , sir . He 's right . 'Course , I 'm right ! Two years , I 'd say , and then it 's night-night Colonel Cancer , sir ! Stop it ! Stop that ! Don 't you dare do that ! Ho ho , it 's the missus ... Leave him alone . Why ? Because my husband is better than that . Your husband is gone , Mrs Jackman . Erased , boiled away and never ever coming back . Do you get it , Mrs Jackman ? He 's dead , Mrs Jackman . Any questions , Mrs Jackman ? Yes , one . The Apple Yard . Okay . Good question . The Apple Yard , room 702 . Now you see , she 's smart . She 's the one . You girls ... You big Mary 's with your guns , you haven 't got a clue . She 's the one who 's dangerous . Well ? The Apple Yard ? The answer is , I don 't know . You weren 't there . That was our wedding night . You didn 't even exist then . I don 't know . You don 't have Tom 's memories , you told me that . So how can you know about the Apple Yard ? I don 't know ! I get it ! You throw the bread on the water and the ducks ... eat the bread . That 's the basics , yes . Mr Hyde ? Mr Hyde , are you alright ? I like feeding ducks . Is this your usual second date ? I only thought it 'd be nice to talk this time . You don 't have to actually throw the bread at the ducks . I 'm getting their attention . It 's quicker . Mr Hyde ? You 're in a park . You 're feeding ducks . What ? Excuse me ? The bill , please . Just getting it ready . Don 't want the date part crowding on the sex . Stop , stop . - Where are you now ? - In a restaurant . You ordered the bill . You said ... Too fast . Too much , too fast . Stop it ! Good boy , shh . Good boy , good boy . How 's yours doing ? Almost gone . Can we swap ? Half of the work done . Stop ! What 's wrong , what 's happening ? Stop ! They did . They stopped . What are you seeing right now ? We can 't help you unless you tell us . In a kitchen . Their kitchen . I 've got rewind . Look at that . I 've got digital rewind . It 's like Sky + in here ! Can you explain to us what you 're experiencing ? What it 's like , what 's happening to you ? It 's his memories . It 's like I 'm downloading his memories . Big chunks . Like it 's happening . Tom 's memories . Hence the Apple Yard . Does that mean he 's still in there ? Tom 's still in there somewhere . He 's alive . No . That means he 's dead . The brain is reallocating the memory space . You killed him , Peter . Not killed , technically , more like deleted . Deleted ? I 'd be careful if I were you . Careful . Three months married and I 'm already competing with the television . I like this film . Is there nudity ? No . Okay , then . I 'm back in the game . Now we 're talking . What 're you seeing now ? I finally found the adult channels . What does that mean ? You know the way you sometimes think men are mentally undressing you ? Peanuts ! She switched channels ! It is not a tale , it is a trap . Typical woman , it 's a costume drama . The secret of this potion , you are certain it is known to you alone ? Yes . You are wrong . It is known to one other . Who ? Me . What are you seeing ? What are you seeing now ? Tell us what you see . It 's like Victorian times . And Daddy 's here . No , not Daddy . Granddad . No . Great-granddad . Great-great ... whatever . Dr Jekyll . The original . Doesn 't look a bit like Spencer Tracy . How can he have a memory of the original Dr Jekyll ? He was never there . I don 't know . Race memory ? Race memory doesn 't work like that . For us it doesn 't . Maybe he 's got something better . I only want to know that I 'm right . One never quite knows who 's listening . The secret of Dr Jekyll 's potion . What 's he saying ? It 's the original pronunciation . Dear God , he can 't actually be there , can he ? Nothing will appear on my account . You can trust me . You will tell no one . It dies with you . Dr Jekyll 's last secret . It 's not a tale . It is a trap . What ? Tell us , what ? How long 've you been looking for Dr Jekyll 's potion ? Cost you a bit , has it ? Burned a hole in the bucket ? At the beginning . And you used Jekyll 's notes ? His notes , yes . And what happened when anyone drank it ? They died . He sent you on a wild goose chase ! With a little bit of murder on the side . Alice . Were you listening ? What do you hope to achieve , sir ? Your protection . With a tale of a magic potion ? D 'you think anyone will think that 's the truth ? The truth is just a tale told often enough . The truth is me , sir , and we both know it . I raise the devil in you , not any potion . My touch . My love . Me . What ? It 's you . You then , and you now . You 're here ... And you 're there . What d 'you mean ? Where am I ? With him . Back then , with Dr Jekyll . You 're with Dr Jekyll . You . It 's all about ... you . Alice . Oh , Alice . You 're the one thing that keeps me here . Without you , I 'm just him . Well , do you see ? The one thing that keeps him here . Keeps him here and keeps you weak . Look at her ! You will always be weak with her in the world . She 's still alive . But what if she wasn 't ? Imagine . Oh , imagine . You could be free . She keeps you weak . Only her . You know what you need . Claire ! You alright , Mrs Jackman ? What time is it ? - Half past three . - In the morning . We know . I 've bloody had fifteen separate food cravings . She drew pictures of the last three . It passed the time , didn 't it ? Four women locked in a room without a single magazine . Is that some kind of vile experiment ? Can I see that ? Anything in particular ? You 've got photographs of Dr Jekyll . What about the people around him ? His friends ? People he knew ? No , not really . Members of his households , his servants . Who 's she ? What 's happened to her face ? Oh , yeah , the maid . That 's interesting , isn 't it ? It 's the same thing on this one . The damage is on the original photograph . Done at the time , I think . Like someone was trying to conceal her identity . Why ? Dr Gilligan ? D 'you want anything from the canteen ? No ... Oh , yeah . Something chocolaty . Dr Gilligan . Neckaty-neck-neck . Syme . Hello , this is Syme . Who is this ? The next stage of human evolution . How much do you get for that , these days ? Mr Hyde ? Where 's Dr Gilligan ? Don 't know . Probably down on the booze with his mates , having a laugh . Mr Hyde ... That lab is secure . You 're in the centre of a secure area . You can 't leave this building ... If I want to leave this building , there 's nothing you 've got could stop me . But you know what ? That 's not what I want . Tell us what you want , Mr Hyde . Who are you ? What do you want ? I want her . I want Claire . You know what I 'm thinking ? God forbid you should ever have an unexpressed thought . I 'm thinking about the wastepaper bin . Sorry ? You 'd all need to turn your back . Oh , for God 's sake . I 'm a pregnant woman ! And you 're getting nowhere with that lock . Thumbprint activated . I 'm sure this is a print scanner . You used to be so good with locks , didn 't you , dear ? Technology 's running away with me . Just not fun being locked up anymore . Like you ever listen when I say that . So , why you ? I 'm sorry ? My husband gave you a job . - Why you ? - I 'm qualified . I 'm a fully qualified psychiatric nurse . Does that come with a uniform ? As far as I know , he 's never had any interest in me other than professional . And I certainly have no interest in him . - Really ? - Not my type . Very much not my type . Oh , come on . Is that actually likely ? I mean , just between you and me . Just as girls together , all good taste and decency aside . He does spend half his time as a world-class hottie . Yeah , well , he spends the other half as Mr Hyde ! Oh , you meant the other ... the other way around . See what I did there ? You have good taste . Mrs Jackman . - Your husband wants to see you . - He 's up at last , is he ? What is he wanting , bacon and eggs ? I 'll take you to him . What does he want ? I 'll take you . Are my children here ? Where are my children ? I need to see them . They 're being looked after and ... we should go . What 's going to happen to her ? Mrs Jackman . When you 're talking to Mr Hyde , keep watching the lights . If Dr Jackman is in there somewhere , the lights will flicker . It happens when he 's fighting to get out . Like he needs to draw the energy or something , give himself a leg up . If he 's in there fighting , the lights will flicker . You 're very observant . He 's strong , Mrs Jackman . And if there 's any way for him to come back , he 'll come back for you . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . OK , let 's go . So , what about us ? Yes , because quite honestly , desperate for a pee . We 're taking you home . Oh , no need , we brought a car . Just point us towards the door . We 're taking you home . No need . No problem . Oh , my God . Mrs Jackman . Hi honey , I 'm home . Oh , you 're scared . Love that . And just a little bit excited . A teensy-weensy bit . Or is that me ? Well ? On their way . Moment alone with the wife , boys ? Oh , nice and private . What am I , getting lucky or something ? No , you 're not getting lucky . Messing with my head now , Mr Big Scary Man ? I 'm so afraid . D 'you know how they killed your husband ? - They put him in a box . - Yeah . They put him in a box . Couldn 't figure it out , at first . Didn 't make any sense . They didn 't give him any drugs , I 'd have felt that . Just one big shot of adrenaline , that 's all . But you know what ? They didn 't have to give him drugs . He was claustrophobic . All they needed . His biggest nightmare come true . Buried alive in a big steel box . Wired up to keep him fully alert . Completely aware of every passing second . Can you imagine ? Afraid of the dark , with your eyes plain to open . Wouldn 't you just die ? That 's how they killed him . They drove him mad , Mrs Jackman . They drove him out of my head . They put him in a box . How do you know he went mad ? Because I 'm here and he 's not . No , no , no , no ! The lights won 't flicker this time . There 's not enough power in this whole building to put Humpty together again ! He 's down a deep dark corner and he 's never coming out . Tom . Tom , if you 're in there , I need you . I need you now . Can 't hear you , love . Never gonna hear you again . But you know , you 're right . There 's always a chance , so let 's be sure that you and me give him a memory he can never live with . Tom , I know you 're still in there . You 're my husband and you would never hurt me . - And I know you 're still in there . - All gone , love . Hubby 's all gone to dust . Tom , you wouldn 't do this . You would stop this ! Good , you 're gonna fight ! I was worried you wouldn 't . - I 'm gonna scratch your eyes out ! - Goody . Try , I 'd like that . Tom 's never coming back . Any minute now , Tom won 't even want to come back . Oh , he 'll come back , you hear me ? Knock yourself out . Killing me will not be enough . Oh , sweetheart . Not nearly enough . Mummy ? Hello boys , it 's Uncle Billy ! What are you doing to Mummy ? We 're playing ! It 's playtime ! You will not touch my children ! I swear I will kill you if you touch my children ! Syme ! I want ten minutes . Ten minutes playtime . You will not touch my children . Make it twenty . I swear you will not get out of here alive . I swear it ! What the hell . Give me half an hour . I know you can hear me . You have half an hour . Gee , thanks Mum ! You 're the best ! He 's a child . Give him what he wants and he 'll be ours . Peter ? Are you there ? Peter , if you can hear this , you can 't let this happen , Peter , please ! They 're your godchildren ! Turn it off . For Christ 's sake , turn it off ! You can 't let this happen ! They 've turned off the cameras . All of them . No one can see or hear us . Suckers ! We have ½ hour to get out of here . Come on , Mrs Jackman , let 's get those kiddies home ! We can get out through the floor . The cable docks . That gets us into the next room , then into the carter . Hang on . Yeels ! Next room ... carter ... no worries . He 's got a good memory , your husband . Comes in very handy . You 're not gonna hurt us , then ? Oh , take a joke , can 't you ? A joke ? You said you were gonna kill us ! And they turned off the cameras . Let 's go home , honey ! I 'm supposed to trust you ? You 're safe with me . You 're a psychopath , then I 'm not safe ! I 'm a psychopath with superpowers and you 're my girl . - You are not my husband . - It 's you that kept saying that , baby . - Changed my mind . - Know the feeling . You are not Tom ! I 'll tell you what I am : I 'm strong . I don 't care how strong you are . I 'm so strong I walk through this funny little world of yours and I don 't notice it . It bores me . But you ... You , Mrs Jackman ... You make me weak . I notice you . You 've never been safer in your life . Let 's go . Boys . Am I your father ? Give me your hands . It 's alright , give me your hands . Look closer . You know me . You always know me . Am I your father ? Okey-dokey , you first . Why me ? Fantastic arse ! As you 're gonna be taking us home , wouldn 't asking our addresses be an idea ? Colonel ! Mr Syme ? No one 's in the life support casket now , are they ? I 'm getting readings . Jesus Christ ! Get out of my way ! Get those cameras back on ! Expansion hatch . They went out through the power hub . Can 't go down , there 'll be a total lockdown . - So where are we going ? - The roof . Then what ? One thing at a time . D 'you have the same fingerprints as Tom ? No . That 's a thumbprint scanner . No one gets up there unless they 're allowed . Trust me . Get the bloody thing open ! My God ! What did he do to you ? He cut off my thumb ! We 're getting out here . Send the lift back down , they 'll be tracking us . We 'll take the stairs the rest of the way , it 's only two floors . The wife 's making a bit of a fuss , so could you put this in a fridge ? It 's for Dr Gilligan . - What is it ? - He 'll recognise it . Excuse me , who are you ? That 's a point , but I kill you . What 're you doing ? You 're killing him ! Trust me , I 'm a psychopath . - Leave him , don 't ! - But I 've started ! You 're not gonna kill that man . Or anyone . From now on , no more killing people . All day , every day , without killing someone ? - What kind of life is that ? - It 's called marriage , honey . What am I gonna do with him ? Tie him up . That takes ages . There . He 'll be out for twenty minutes . No , solid . We 'll take the full hour . It 's OK , don 't look . - There 's a heliport on the roof ? - What about it ? Heliport , yeah . OK , question . Quite a big question , if I 'm honest . Can I fly a helicopter ? That 's the plan ? " Can I fly a helicopter ? " That 's the plan ? Wait . He had a lesson . Yeah , he did , he had a lesson . I thought he did . I 've got him sitting in a helicopter . No , it 's a moped . No , it 's a helicopter . Oh , Jesus Christ ! Actually , could 've been a horse . His attention really wandered , didn 't it ? Mr Hyde . These weapons are aimed at your wife and your children . If you hesitate in any way to comply with my instructions , we will first kill the child on your left . Signal your understanding , but do not speak . You have a gun in your left hand . You 'll drop it . No play acting , Mr Hyde . I know how much they mean to you . My camera was never switched off . She makes you weak . Not that weak . This organisation has waited over a hundred years for you . There is nothing you can accomplish with that gun that will change a thing . I will count to five and you will drop it . One . - Two . - Never gonna make it to five ! Then neither will your children . Three . Let my family go , or I 'll blow my brains out . You waited over a hundred years , don 't miss out now ! Let them go ! No . Kill yourself . It 's a good plan , I never thought of that . Kill yourself . If you 're dead , we have no further use for your family . You can save ' em now . Just kill yourself . Blow your brains out . Can you do it ? Tom Jackman could do it , he loves them enough . Do you ? Four . No , don 't ! Five . 'Course not . Too afraid of dying . Like all children . You 're just a child , Mr Hyde . We took the man in you away . As we 're up here , I 'll take the helicopter now . I 'll take the Jackmans with me . Where are you taking them ? Where you will follow . We have your family and you have no choice . You will come to us . Welcome to the company , Mr Hyde . I was hoping for a longer journey . All three of you . Go and stand in the beam of the headlights , right in the middle . This is murder . No . No , we 're just taking a break . You must 've been a soldier once . What could possibly be worth all this ? A cure for cancer ? Oh , I see . You wanna live . I know the feeling . I 'm supposed to be a superman . Why am I not a superman ? Daddy ? Why am I not a superman ? Daddy ! I 'm supposed to be dangerous . Why am I not a superman ? Are you listening to me , Daddy ? I 'm supposed to be Superman ! Half a man . For her . Yes , Mr Hyde , we all know about your little power draining trick . But it won 't work this time . Tom Jackman 's gone . There isn 't enough power in this entire building to bring him back . Oh , my God . My God . Sorry ladies , not my decision . Oh , God . What are we gonna do ? Run ! After them ! This way . Mr Hyde ? Sorry . You 're not dealing with Junior anymore . Daddy 's home . I want you to send a message to your boss . To those people who took my family . Three words . We are coming . " We " ? There is no " we " , Tom . You 're alone . Alone against everyone . Three words . We are coming . Send it . Sign it ... " Jekyll ... " " ... and Hyde " .

I 'm looking for this girl . Have you seen my niece ? There was a guy here looking for your sister . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] - I get rid of him ! - Riley ! If you don 't leave , I 'm calling the police . ( John ) That guy is really dangerous . That 's all you need to know . Really dangerous . This has nothing to do with Riley . You 're pissed off because I found someone I actually like Spending time with , and it 's not you .

I bought her a helmet . Responsible . You think it 'll stop a bullet ? Why , you gonna take a shot at her ? A lot of bullets fly around here , someone will . You care about this girl ? Yeah . Then leave her alone . I 'll talk to John . John 's not listening . He 's always listening . I was going to suggest a safe . Well , you might have suggested it before we got robbed . Where are you going ? I need to restock the supply drop . We 've been using a lot of ammunition . Business has been booming . Where 's John ? Still in his room . He hasn 't gotten up yet ? He needs more sleep than you do . It 's because the circadian rhythm of teenagers is abnormal . How late were you up talking to him ? Not late . He won 't be seeing Riley anymore . Is that so ? John 's not stupid . I don 't like the way he responds to you . You got what you wanted . [ DRILLING ] Where is he ? Check under the bed . You don 't know . ( John ) I didn 't even know if you were busy when I texted you tonight . ( Riley ) I 'm never busy . So then I guess I should do it again sometime . Or maybe you could even call .

Are you busy ? No . Did you change ? It 's hot out . Since when do you feel heat ? I feel heat . Are you hoping that Riley 's gonna see us in bed together , And be totally scarred for the rest of her life or something ? No . I watched Riley leave till I couldn 't see her anymore . And then you and mom high-fived . You bring danger into Riley 's life . I know that . I 'm not stupid . But sometimes you do stupid things . It would help me to understand why . Humans do stupid things . So don 't worry about it , and be happy you 're a machine . I 'm a machine . I can 't be happy . But I understand more than you think . So you understand that I 'm going to keep seeing Riley , Even if everyone thinks it 's a bad idea . I understand that it 's a bad idea . And ... I understand that being John Connor can be lonely . Oh , yeah ? How do you understand that ? You and I talk about it a lot . We do ? We do . We will . I need ... I need to get some sleep . And Riley ? I know . I know . He won 't be seeing Riley anymore . I don 't like the way he responds to you . [ DRILLING ] You got what you wanted . [ DRILLING ] It 's just you . You been stealing my supplies ? We needed to make a small bomb . I set this drop up with my people for my people . And everything 's in here for a reason . John was supposed to ask . John needs to get his head in the game . Maybe he couldn 't find you . You don 't spend much time at the house . I don 't have a bed , remember ? You didn 't have a bed in the old house . I had a gunshot wound at the old house . Yes . You almost died . [ CELL PHONE RING ] It 's not the first time . Who 's that ? Alarm code from John . He 's in trouble . I need to get some sleep . And Riley ? I know . I know . Yeah , right . [ DIAL TONE ] I 'll be there in a few minutes . Ew , please stop doing that . Look , I got this from my foster parents . And it 's a rape whistle . It 's totally for moments like this . Moments like this ? - Yeah , all right . When I was a kid , I ... I lived in Mexico for a year and a half . In this , uh , little village called Dejalo . And , uh ... That 's where we 're going . Thought I 'd show you around . Um , well , did you run this idea by your mom ? Because sometimes I get the impression That she doesn 't really like surprises . I don 't care . Did you guys get in a fight last night ? No . So this is definitely a field trip , And not some revenge fantasy ? All right , if you don 't wanna go , that 's cool . But do not make me feel like I 'm kidnapping you or something . Oh , no , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You just caught me off guard . I 'm really , really happy that you want To show me where you grew up . Good . 'cause I booked the honeymoon suite . Wait , what ? It 's good , right ? It 's nice to get some space . You and space . You know , the first time we talked , You were sitting by yourself in the grass . That was space too . So it was . You know I used to watch you at school ? When the bell would ring And those narrow hallways would fill up , It got so loud , and people would bump into you . You looked like you could just Jump out the window and run away . God , you 're such a little stalker . All right , so I get that ... We ran away to get some space . [ CHUCKLES ] The only shame is ... We ran all this way , and there 's skulls everywhere . What , you don 't like skulls ? I like other things better . It 's for Dia De Los Muertos . The festival 's tonight . Nice . Skulls and darkness , how charming . Doing the best I can . ( Riley ) I never want to leave this room . Wait , I think I see the problem . Would you just get in here ? We don 't need bubbles . Well , there 's bubbles to be had , And I 'm going to have bubbles . Ah , not bad , huh ? You 're a total pro . Wait , you didn 't live here with your mom , did you ? No . We , uh ... We actually had a cabana on the beach . I think we had very different childhoods . It wasn 't always good . Sometimes I wish we just stayed here . Away from everybody . People suck . Not just people . No , I mean ... When you meet someone , you don 't Really expect to give a damn about them , right ? Who 's got the time ? Life 's too short , and people suck . I don 't like getting attached to people . So ... Why were you living in Mexico ? Oh , you 're thinking of a lie or a joke . - No , I 'm not . - yes , you are . - You have a tell . - I just don 't want to sit around And talk about my messed up childhood . Can 't we just enjoy ourselves ? Yeah , fine . Enjoy yourself , John .

The domestic terrorism case . You 're familiar with the Connors ? It was flagged during processing . But we dismissed it as a coincidence . Your fugitive would be 24 years old by now , If he was not already dead . Look , I 'd be grateful for just a visual identification To help bring me some closure . You have traveled an awful long way for closure . If he is who I think he is , Then I have reason to believe that your prison is in danger . And yes , I 've come a long way .

And you still came to Mexico ? You could have led it right to John . It wasn 't me in the trunk . So what were you going to do , Just pop him out of jail ? Set him free , no questions asked ? ( Ellison ) Yes , actually . That 's exactly what I was going to do . Hm , I have a hard time believing that . [ SIGHS ] I owed you one . The fire . Silberman 's cabin ? Wasn 't much .

All things are possible To him who believes . We 'll attract less attention if we don 't travel together . You want me to leave ? What 's next ? We 'll come back down here . And bring something with us to destroy it . His name 's gonna be on an alert . He 's got other names . Then what ? There is no " Then what . " Pretend I died again . I lost a lot when you died the first time . My marriage , my career . That 's a lot to you ? I suppose many people lost those things . You want answers . I just want to know my role in all of this .

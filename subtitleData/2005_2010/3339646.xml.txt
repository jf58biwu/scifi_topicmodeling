Where are you ? Don 't worry about me , John . Just get to the pier . - I 'm sorry . I have to go . - What ? - I thought we were going to the movies . - I have to meet my mom at the pier . Seriously ? Look John , I 'm not afraid of your mother . Not like you are . I have to go . I 'll call you . Don 't forget the secret code ! Come on . I figure it 's five miles to the highway if we head due west . Across the desert . We need a car . We need to get to John . Oh , God . How bad is it ? I can 't tell . I can 't tell if the shrapnel knicked an artery or something ... She could be bleeding out , inside , I don 't know . - We have to go . - Go ? Go how ? On foot . No way , Sarah . I 'm not moving her . And I 'm not making her walk . I 'll send someone back for you as soon as I can . I can walk . No one has to wait on me . So ... You know who I am . You know what happened . George Lazlo was a shooter . George Lazlo is dead . It 's all in the report . And yet here you are . Five years ago , a small commuter jet went down in the Eastern Sierras . On its way from Sacramento to Portland . My brother was on the NTSB team that investigated the accident . He found these . And brought them to me . My late husband and I have spent three years and $ 20 million , trying to reverse engineer this technology . We 've not been successful . Yet . Red valley , new Mexico . Eight years ago . 22 witnesses report seeing a man with some kind of robot leg , try to kill a boy later identified as John Connor . Son of Sarah Connor . It was your case . She believed robots were after her son . I know what she believed , Ms. Weaver . You know what really killed those agents . You did not even pretend to ask me what those were . What do you want from me ? I want what you want , Mr. Ellison . I want answers . But more than that , I want you to help me find another one . Where 's John ? Get out . Out ! Sarah , slow down ! She 's bleeding out . I need to get pressure on it , Sarah . Damn you , Charley . I told you to stay away . Sarah , you 've gotta stop now , please ! - You should have stayed away . - I 'm here now and she 's here now . You 've got to stop . Now ! Little help ? - I don 't swim . - Yeah , I just figured that out . Mom , I 'm good . Let 's go . We do not lose heart . Though outwardly we are wasting away , inwardly , we are being renewed ... Day-by-day . For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory , that far outweighs them all . We know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the Heavens . For God who 's given us the Spirit as a guarantee , and as long as we are at home in the body , we are away from the Lord . We walk by faith , not by sight . And so we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but what is unseen . For what is seen is temporary . What is unseen ... eternal .

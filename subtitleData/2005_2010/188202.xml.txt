 It 's us . ( announcer ) Who is she ? Does she have the answers ? All ready ? Ready as we 're ever gonna be . We thought it was understood , the invitation was for Dr. Daughtery only . ( announcer ) And now , Surface continues . Listen , honey , I 'm really sorry I didn 't call . But it just- - I didn 't think it 'd be very safe . So good to see you . Did you--did you see us on MSNBC ? Yeah . You and the other woman . Now , honey , I told you it wasn 't like that . You went down into a submarine with her . Submersible . I 'm not stupid . Honey . These things are incredible , okay ? The size of ' em . I mean , you couldn 't imagine it . But you saw the program , right ? You saw them . They were on there . Who are you ? Ed Blagman . Who 's he ? I 'm not trying- - I 'm not talking to you . What is he doing here ? This is my house . Your house ? My house . Your family . You just left us . I didn 't leave anybody . I told you exactly- - Who is this guy ? ! He 's my divorce lawyer . We 're offering a reward . $ 10,000 . $ 10,000 . They killed my son . We 're offering a reward . 10,000 bucks in the off season ? It 's gonna be a war zone . Caitlin 's saving me a seat . Unless you want it . No . I 'm fine here . ( man ) Everybody take your seats , please ! Come on , people . Well , it 's good to see so many concerned citizens here today . Yeah , well , I 'm concerned . I 'm concerned I 'm going to get my ass bit off every time I check my crab traps . It 's not a joke , Burt . You see me laughing ? Sit down , Burt , let him talk ! We hear you got one at the aquarium . Everyone , please- - Quiet ! We 've got a lot to cover . And I 'll need to have some order here . You want order , you got to level with us . You got one or not ? We have a specimen . Whether it 's the same species we 're looking for , we can 't be sure at this point . Eggs . Washed up on Wrightsville Beach . A week ago , we lost a son there . My wife and I. He was swimming at that beach just like I do and just--just like you do and just like all our children do . And what have they done ? Nothing ! Now I don 't know about you . But I 'm not going to sit around here and wait for more of these things to wash into town and hatch- - ( man ) Turn that off ! ( woman ) Can 't somebody fix that ? 2,2 ? IThe gifted few.UVUUU * I 'm--I 'm sorry . Most scientists are " narrow-minded , " dull , and just plain stupid . " Uh , James Watson , right ? Of Watson-Crick . Mm-hmm . He was right . Then there are the gifted few , those who despite their hubris and contempt for received opinion do the heavy lifting , make the real breakthroughs . Do you take sugar ? Um , uh , yes . Thank you . I was going to be one of those . I was going to save the world . Instead ... How did it happen ? Money , of course . And they appealed to my vanity . That was my mistake . They--who ? They gave my everything I wanted . Funds , freedom , unlimited resources . Yeah , but who 's the " they " ? I received my doctorate in 2000 . Arguably the most important year in the history of science . The year Venter sequenced the human genome . It was a thrilling time . A paradigm shift . And everyone in genomics knew it . We were going to unlock the secrets of how life began . " Congratulations on conferral of your doctorate . " We would like to discuss your academic research " and propose an extraordinary employment opportunity . " First in your class . Magna . Published two articles in Nature . Impressive . But let 's be frank . There are a lot of impressive people in laboratories all over the world . At our firm , we 're interested in the level beyond . Men and women with the capacity of becoming a Kepler , a Heisenberg , an Einstein . I 'm flattered . But what firm do you represent ? We are primarily a genomics firm made up of like-minded scientists willing to work beyond the commonly accepted frontiers of genetics . What do you mean by frontiers ? Frontiers of knowledge , of technique , of societal conceptions of morality . Your graduate thesis on stimulating the neurotransmitters was just the kind of work we admire . Only lacked one thing . And what was that ? The opportunity to test your theories on a thousand test subjects . That would 've taken money . Unlimited resources and unwavering support . We provide both . This is Dolly . The sheep that was supposedly cloned in 1996 . An impressive first if it had been first . We cloned our first sheep in the early 1960s . You cloned a sheep in the 1960s . And gibbons and pandas . And the infamous Archaeopteryx . The Archaeopteryx is extinct . We 've assumed a kind of custodial attitude toward the biosphere . Now I know this is a lot to process . I don 't- - Um , I don 't understand . Who , um , who pays for all this ? The firm has a vast library of patents- - mostly medical--that funds a substantial endowment . We 'd like to make you part of the firm . Our only two requirements are confidentiality and a permanent commitment . Permanent ? Employees commit for a lifetime . In exchange , we offer whatever salary you require . I- - I require a lot . Fine . I should 've added a zero . I went to work the next day . Everything I 'd been promised was true . But there were other drawbacks . The corporation is extremely private . Employees work alone . There 's no last names . Socializing is forbidden . There 's frequent rotation to other facilities around the world . I mean , that sounds like a terrorist cell . Infinitely more cautious than that . And all this for the money . This isn 't about the money . That 's not their agenda . Uh , and what is the- - what is the agenda ? Well , there 's the rub . Each scientist is given their own specific focus . One that precludes a larger sense of the whole . So I built the carburetor . But I never saw the car . You must ... had some idea . Over time , I had my theories . That 's why I contacted you . " When the stars threw down their spears " and water 'd heaven with their tears , " did he smile his work to see ? Did he who made the lamb make thee ? " You all right ? She said what ? She said the species are manmade . Manmade ? Yeah . Genetically engineered , like mold-resistant wheat . Hang on a second now . You telling me a person created these things ? Who ? Deja vu all over again . You and your friend pulling an egg out of the water . That 's how this all started , right ? Yeah , that 's how it started . ( man ) Dr. Blum ! Take a look . Creep show . Looks contagious . ( Dr. Blum ) Miles , get me a cooler , will you ? Miles , what are you doing ? Killing them . ? Do you--do you realize how incredible this is ? I mean , there 's maybe , maybe two dozen people in the entire world who understand the true possibilities of genomics . And clearly this firm knows how to recombine DNA . It 's mind-blowing . What ? It just kills me . All this time I thought it was something holy . And here it is . It 's just some egghead in a lab somewhere . Boy , I thought I was chosen , you know . So did she . Yeah , but see , she didn 't lose her family over it and that 's the thing . While you were out there , I went home . Saw Tracy . She wants a divorce . Rich , man , I 'm sorry . I really am . Do you need to go back ? No . No . If I quit now , then it 'd really be for nothing . So let 's just keep going , all right ? So let 's talk about this . Figure it out . You said that--she said that every member of this outfit had a part to play , right ? Yeah . Okay . But that none of them knew the entire design ? But that 's ridiculous . Somebody had to know the entire design , right ? No . I don 't know . I don 't think she knew . But , I mean , someone designed it . Oh , gosh , I can figure this out . How ? That 's the first rule of the insurance biz , man . You follow the money . Okay , she said they funded medical patents , right ? ( Daughtery ) Try oxidase inhibitor . ( Rich ) Mm-hmm , okay ... ( Daughtery ) The woman said that this secret corporation worked on it in the ' 60s . ( Rich ) SSRI 's . Which are ... what ? ( Daughtery ) Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors . Like--like anti-depressants . You know , happy pills . ( Rich ) Got it . Okay . Well , it 's asking for an active ingredient . All right , try--try , uh , try phenchloramine . ( Rich ) Phenchloramine . Which is ? The actual name for Nortide . The anti-depressant ? The anti-depressant is right . The corporation developed it . Okay , the original patent was filed December , ' 63 . Time line 's right . By who ? What ? It 's been redacted . How 's a source patent for an anti-depressant classified ? When someone with sway doesn 't want to get traced . All right , well , hey , that means we 're on the right track , right ? So , uh ... who makes Nortide ? Lorentech . As in the world 's biggest pharmaceutical company ? Yeah . Go ahead . Spill it . What ? A week ago , you 're all hot and heavy with Caitlin , and today you 're staring into an empty incubation tank . Go ahead , ask . I 'm an expert on women . Look , thanks , but- - Come on , dude . Psychology 101 . You can 't keep things all bottled up . You gotta talk it out . Okay . But , dude , it 's a total secret . She 's pregnant . No , no . Nothing like that . It--it 's me and Nim . Observation . I 'm asking you about a woman and you 're talking about an unclassified marine vertebrate , which is in itself a warning sign . But go ahead . Okay . Um ... You know howim zaps things , like , electrically ? Admittedly that 's weird . Yeah , well ... I do it too . You zap things . Yeah . Something very strange is happening to me . It 's call puberty , dude . No . No , no . That 's not it . I-I-I zap things , man . I can 't control it . It just happens sometimes . It 's like I 'm--I 'm connected . Not only to Nim , but to the other ones . Like--like I 'm part of them . And sometimes it 's like I c--I can hear what they 're thinking . And it 's driving me crazy . Oh , I get it now . A jokester , huh ? You had me going there for a second . But you know with that deadpan of yours , I can see why Caitlin thinks you 're a little odd , bro . ( male voice over P.A. ) Lorentech--we see the future and make it happen today . Lorentech is the leading scientific discovery corporation in the world . Hi . Annie Boertz . Media relations . Hey , Andy " Dick " Yarbourough . Pleasure to meet you . This is Sue Truftin . Hi . Now , Sue 's my fact checker . So if I get anything wrong , you blame her , okay ? Don 't worry , we will . So ... So . We really appreciate you taking the time . We , um , we 're really interested in finding out a little bit more history about one of your products , Nortide . The anti-depressant . That 's right . One of our biggessellers . Oh , we know it . And Nortide 's just meant so much to so many people that we were really curious to find out a little bit more about the man who 's responsible- - Or woman . That 's right , Sue . Thanks . She keeps me honest , doesn 't she . Or the person who is responsible for developing the drug initially . Who led the design team ? You know ... I don 't know . That is a very good question . Do you mind waiting here for a sec ? See if I can dig something up . Okay . Why did you do that ? What ? You 're killing me with the lines here . I mean , I 'm trying to stick to my lines . No , no , no . I was just trying to look at it- - Don 't--don 't improvise . That is killing me . She thinks- - Should we get out of here ? Should we get out of here ? Hi . This is Bill Wolf , one of our in-house counsels . Hey , Bill . How are you ? Mr. Yarbourough . Ms. Truftin . Hi , how are you ? You know , we called Scientific Explorer and they said you didn 't actually work there . No . That 's , uh , not technically . But that 's just because we 're- - Because we 're freelance . And actually , uh , Scientific Explorer is really interested in the piece . And it wouldn 't take us very long to--to go through the archives . I 'm sorry , but our archives are private . Do you need validation ? That is what I call getting stonewalled . Yeah , but we ain 't giving up that easy . What , you going to go like hack into their archives ? No , it 's only one clue . That 's our only clue . You know , you would 've made a lousy insurance investigator . I 'll take that as a compliment . Hey , wait a minute . What ? Look at all these small biotech firms Lorentech acquired . So ? So you don 't get to be the world 's biggest pharmaceutical company by making everything in-house . You get big by acquisitions . So any one of these firms could 've been the one that made Nortide initially . This is a domesticated specimen . There 's absolutely no guarantee he 'll survive in the wild . So what if he doesn 't ? It 's still the most likely way to get a handle on the problem . You saw how many eggs were out there . So you want to risk losing the one specimen we have that we can actually study to understand the species . This is a domestic safety issue . I got three deaths in under a week and no sense of what we 're dealing with . ( Miles ) What 's going on ? They want to tag Nim . If we tag and release it here , he 'll lead us back to the school . And what are you going to do if you find them ? We 're going to protect this community , son . What else ? Will you help us ? Nim . Nim . ( Rich ) So Lorentech bought this place to get Nortide ? ( Daughtery ) You saw the plaque at Lorentech . They bought everyone that had a good idea . ( Rich ) Yeah , well , knowledge is power . Hello . Hello . Hey , Rich , what you doing ? Told you I ain 't quitting . Ho , hey , whoa . It might be electrified . Hey . This is weird . Wow , there is nobody here . Like a ghost town . I think we should split up . Nah , that 's a terrible idea . Yeah , but look how big this place is . I think we should split up and we can cover it faster . All right , here . You take this then , all right ? It 's a hair trigger . Be careful . What are you going to use ? I 'll use my mind . That 's my best weapon . Here . Like I said , what are you going to use ? Ha ha . Funny . Die , then . Oh , Rich , stop . I was kidding . Come on . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . Just how do you- - how do you cock it ? It 's ready to go . You just take the safety off , all right ? Okay . You got it ? ( sheriff ) Where 's it going ? Back to the intercoastal again . Seems lost . Is that possible ? He 'll find them . Caitlin . I just came in for work and guess what I found out you did . There 's a reason . I know . I know there 's something strange going on with you . That you don 't even wanna understand . I do understand . I 'm changing . And you want to be normal ? Is that so weird ? Besides , Caitlin , these things are killing people . Nim isn 't . Everyone I know is worried that there 's nothing special about them . That they 'll never find what their life is about . But you ... you find something that no one on this planet has ever seen before , ever . Something you claimed you loved . And you 're destroying it . That 's it . Let 's go . All right , let 's do it , boys . Where 's everyone going ? Compton Marsh . Nim has settled in the waterway there . It 's begun . Yeah , there 's no one over here . It 's like it 's abandoned . Yeah , this place is definitely cleared out . Pretty recently too . I got nothin ' down here . I 'm in a room with a bunch of big machines , and , I don 't know ... I found a computer here . All right , well , get on it . See if you can find something . Hey , you got anything ? Yeah , it 's locked with a password , so ... I just need a name . Anything , just who 's behind Nortide . Yeah , there 's just some envelopes , some old invoices . Not a whole hell of a lot . Rich . Rich . Rich . I 'm all right . I 'm all right . Sorry . Don 't--don 't--don 't go silent like that . It sorta freaked me out . Don 't you wish you had that gun now ? Who 's over there ? Somebody in here ? Huh ? I think I found something here . Have you seen my mother ? Hey . What are you doing back here , huh ? Somebody leave you here ? Huh ? Why don 't you come on from back there ? Come on . Come on . Give me a hand . It 's all right , I won 't hurt you . Give me your hand . You 're not my- - ( demonic voice ) Mother . Rich ? Rich , I 'm coming . I 'm coming ! Help me ! Help me . Shoot him ! Shoot him ! ( Captain ) Well , we got ' em on the move here . We 're driving ' em into the Marsh . Just keep driving them this way . We got a little something for them . ( man ) All right , everybody spread out ! Keep bringing ' em down on the right ! ( man ) Get ready . Everybody get ready ! Here they come ! Take aim ! Fire ! Miles . I just ... I want ... Caitlin , something terrible is gonna happen . Hey , Joe . Like fish in a barrel , man . ( Joe ) That 's a keeper , huh ? Ow . Sorry . Mm-hmm . Mm . Sorry . I 'll tell you what , you go to the bottom of the ocean , you see that thing , and you think you 've seen it all . Hold still . Mm . Sorry , Rich . I thought it was going to kill me . I really did . It spoke . Sounded like a little girl . I know . ( computevoice ) That was a mistake . Well , it probably was . But , um , we had an encounter . It 's not just Liopleurodon DNA that they 're manipulating . Listen , I have a list of the board of directors of Iderdex . Okay . I 'm sorry , I can 't . Okay . All you have to do is say yes or no . Daniel Beecher . No . Harvey Pierce . No . Alger Koestler . Alger Koestler . Did you hear what I said ? You are opening a door that cannot be closed . Alger Koestler . Yes or no . Special Collections Library , Berkeley . Good-bye , doctor . Hang in , Jim . Hang on there . Hang on there , buddy . Hang in there . Get back . Get back ! Everybody out of here ! ( Miles ) Nim , stop . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Dr. Morris . Hello . Do you know who I am ? I can guess . I believe you violated company policy . Yes , I did . I 'd like to e-mail my family . To say good-bye . Of course . ( Caitlin ) Miles ? Caitlin . Take my hand . I can 't . Hey , look at me . Take my hand . They won 't hurt us . It 's okay . Take my hand . I 've got to go . You 're so beautiful right now . ( man ) What kind of freak is this kid ? The Koestler archive . Yeah . Alger Koestler . Yes . I-I-I heard that he was actually a professor here at one point . For almost 30 years , up until the early ' 50s . We don 't get a lot of requests for this collection . No ? Well , thank you very much . Happy hunting . I believe this is what you 're looking for . Yes , thank you . Rich . It 's labeled " The Discovery , 1957 . " Obviously , they found something . What in the world do you think they 're looking for ? ( Daughtery ) I don 't know , but whatever it is , I hope ty got it on film . You think that 's Koestler ? ( Rich ) Maybe . ( Daughtery ) It 's a good sized expedition party . Hey , look . Look , look , look at this . There you go . Looks like they found something . Yeah . ( Daughtery ) It looks like a crater or something . ( Rich ) Hey . Is that Cirko 's flower ? I-I don 't understand . What--what does that have to do with ... I know him . I know--I know that guy . He was there . He was there when the creatures breached at Bolinas Bay with Cirko . He--that guy was there . It 's the same guy that got my blood taken at Sullivan 's Island . That 's not possible . Yes , he 's to be 50 years old . I mean that ... guy 'd have to be 80 .

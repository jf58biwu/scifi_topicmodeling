 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Can we get back to the Warehouse computers breach ? - Someone 's poking around in the system . - I should never have told you . Warehouse 13 . I got hacked . Does Artie seem a little ... crankier than usual ? Who 's there ? Someone 's there . I can hear ... - What was that ? - What are you gonna do ? I know this place . - I know this place . - Yes . You 've been here before . You don 't remember it , but you will . So this is a dream ? It 's time to get up , Artie . It 's time to go . Where ... Where am I going ? Back to the beginning . No more zoos , okay ? From now on , if an artifact is at a zoo , - we leave it there . - Monkey 's spit . Artie , do you know that ? They spit , and it is not pleasant . - Tell him about the cheetahs . - I don 't want to think about them . I just ... I want a bath . All right , I 'm sorry about all that . I 'm dealing with a lot here too , okay ? You found who 's hacking into the Warehouse ? I can 't pinpoint the origin of the breach . It 's a little frustrating . Sleep . Artie , you look ... You look terrible . Thank you very much . You still have some monkey phlegm in your hair . It 's not phlegm . Look , Artie , just ... Myka 's right . Get some rest , bro ? Just get back here as soon as possible . We have a lot to do . No , I can 't get up . Yes , you can . Try . I can 't . - How did you get in here ? - I 'm disappointed , Artie . I figured you 'd have me totally clocked by now . I don 't ... I know you ? - What 's going on ? - I 'm hurt . Well , it was a while ago . I was a lot younger , so were you . Looking for this ? Dude , an alarm system ? So not groovy . Besides , this is you-and-me time right now . Yeah , it 's funny . Years ago , I swear you said you were just a simple professor . I guess you left out the off-the-grid , top-secret Warehouse full of madcap . Claudia . Claudia Donovan . You 're the breach . Knock , knock . I 'm sorry . I don 't have time for games , and these cuffs are not gonna stop me . I know , but check this . It 's supercharged cuffs , see ? 20,000 volts . Designed it myself . You like ? - Well done . - Thank you . Now chill . I 'm not in the mood . Kid , look , that was a long , long , long time ago , that stuff . Time flies , Professor . It really does . I 'm not responsible for Joshua 's death . Claudia , look , just stop it right now before you do something you regret . I regret ? Me ? Have you got it back-asswards . You 're responsible for what happened . It 's all good . You know why ? It 's payback time for me and for Joshua . So let 's go , Artie . Time to make good on your promise . The door is open . That 's not good . Artie would never leave his Farnsworth . If there were trouble , Artie would have triggered the ... Alarm ? Someone took Artie ? Projet-SG ( 1.00 ) Damn it ! I don 't know what to do . The cache is wiped , there 's no tracks outside , and there 's no clues in here . - Don 't worry . We 'll figure it out . - Don 't worry ? Could that be Artie ? I 'm calling for Artie . You two are decidedly not he . Mrs. Frederic , hi . Look , we got some really bad news . Artie 's gone . Someone took him . That doesn 't happen . Agents don 't get taken out of the Warehouse . Our security system is ... I see . The person who 's breached the security , he 's taken Artie . - Any idea who this guy is ? - None . So can we put out an APB or alert the authorities ? We are the authorities . What did you learn from the directional spectrometer ? - The spectro ... - It shows the afterimages of anyone who 's been in the room in the last five hours . You kidding me ? That 's , like , our favorite thing , with all the lights and so forth . Once you 've ID 'd them , let me know . And stay put . I don 't need three missing agents . Okay , but , Mrs. Frederic , look , if we have a lead , we could just ... Consider yourself under lockdown . I know this place . It 's a lab . It 's Joshua 's old lab . - Come on . Away from the door . - I 'm fine right here . - Think so ? - Or there . There is very good too . You 're doing this all wrong , Claudia . Brought me here in daylight , used my car . These are amateur moves , and for what ? What are you gonna do to me ? Kill me ? Because a long time ago , your brother died in an accident ? - Come on . - He 's not dead . It was a terrible , terrible accident , - but we both witnessed it , he 's gone . - No , no , no . He 's not . He 's stuck . - Listen to yourself . - No , this isn 't in my head ! You 're gonna see . - Be careful . - Okay , okay . Let 's open this baby up , see what she 's got . That 's cool . - Okay . All right . - That is crazy . Strange person of authority . - Who is that ? - I don 't know . - Hold on . - Who is that ? I don 't know . Hang on . - Do you have it ? - Okay , yes . Here we go , here we go . Okay , there we go . Okay , that 's weird . Did you see that ? Was he saying something ? What did ... What is he saying ? Do you ... Go , go . Wait , wait . That 's a trip . It 's ... I can 't . " Claudia Donovan " . - How did you ... - My sister taught me how to read lips . - Why does your sister ... - The deaf find it handy . Okay , Claudia Donovan ... where are you now ? Mrs. Frederic said we should stay here . Really ? I didn 't hear that . Neither did I. Looks like she was institutionalized . What if she 's dangerous ? So , okay , this is what ? This is poetic justice , bringing me back where it all started ? No , we 're here because it 's strongest here . We need that if you 're gonna bring Joshua back . Back ? You did a nice job on these , by the way . What 's conducting the charge ? A lithium filament ? - It 's very fine craftsmanship . - Dude , just shut it down , can we not ? Claudia , you are not well . All right . Joshua 's death was ... - He got the rules wrong , Claudia . - Yeah , ' cause he got sloppy , didn 't he ? Right ? We both know why he did that , don 't we , Artie ? Is Claudia in some kind of trouble with the secret service ? In the four years that she lived here , did she ever give you any problems ? No , not at all . She was very nice . Well , what can you tell us about Claudia ? Well , I 'm not one to gossip , but you might not know . She lost her parents when she was just a child . Poor thing . Her brother raised her . Then a few years later , he passed too . Can you believe it ? More bad luck than a turtle on his back . She went off to live with a foster family . If you ask me , I think it all just finally hit her . Then six months ago , she checked herself into a psychiatric-care clinic . You know about that ? Of course you do . You 're the government . You probably know what pills I take . Anyway , she keeps up on her rent . She checked herself out two months ago . Has she contacted you ? Well , no , I haven 't seen her . - She 's got a home base somewhere . - Did she ever stay with friends ? I don 't think so . She kept to herself . No boyfriends , no girlfriends . I 'm very nonjudgmental . Here we are . Thank you , Mrs. Richman . We 'll just take a look around . I guess I can trust the secret service . Oh , boy . I 'm guessing this is the brother . I don 't wanna sound like a broken record , but what makes you think that Joshua 's still alive ? 'Cause dead people don 't visit , Einstein . - He visits you ? - Yeah , a lot lately . Your brother Joshua visits you , and he tells you he 's not dead ? Yes . I 'm not appreciating the snark , by the way . Rheticus was right , you know ? His theories ? Joshua was right too . He was this close to proving it . Rheticus ' experiments were never re-created . Never . He was nuts ! Joshua 's gone . You are gonna be so put down when he gets here . Yeah ? Well , you know , I 'll take my chances . God . It 's about the minerals , Professor , the minerals in the metal . That 's what should have made it all work . Sure . You know what I 'm sensing here ? It 's kind of a private chat . Some brother-sister thing . What do you need me for ? Because I took it as far as I could , and now I need you to help me bring him home . You made me a promise . - Something 's wrong . - That 's what I 've been saying , fossil . I can 't ... Professor , I 'm Joshua Donovan . Yeah , I remember this . This is when I met you . - We 've met before ? - Yes . No . You showed me your experiment . You thought I was here to give you a grant , and ... That been happening a lot ? - What ? - You went back . I have the visions too . We 're mad connected . The difference between us is ... I didn 't ignore them . What 's wrong ? - What 's the matter with you ? - It usually happens just before . - Just before what ? - You might wanna sit down for this . He 's here . What is that ? What is happening ? I told you . What the hell was that ? I don 't understand what just happened . What 's going on ? I mean , what the hell was that ? That was Joshua . - No . - Yeah . - You saw it too . I 'm not crazy . - Yes . I saw Joshua . How ? Because he 's not dead . Now you know it too . Help me bring him back . Well , I wouldn 't know where to start . Well , I 've got everything here . The Feldkirch minerals , equipment for an electric field . Did you try to re-create Joshua 's experiment on your own ? You 're such a creaker . Of course I did . The question is , why didn 't you ? So far , none of this stuff is telling me where Claudia might have taken Artie . Are you finding anything ? For a kid , she seems pretty focused on the 16th century . - She 's definitely a thinker . - Always dangerous . - Rheticus . - Rheti-who ? He was a mathematician and mapmaker , a student of Copernicus . Yes , I read books growing up . Right . Why go to the prom ? Of course you did . Three times in one night . It 's a long story . I bet it is . Well , it looks like our girl genius took something with her . Just to clarify , you decided to re-create a clearly dangerous , potentially deadly experiment ? Sure . It sounds bad when you say it like that . These are very real forces that you 're playing with here . - And if you stop to think ... - Chill out , Obi-wan , okay ? I 'm trying to save his life . I really hope we are trying to save it together . I 've spent the last two years of my life trying to figure out what happened to Joshua . And when I reached the end of what I could do , I just kind of sort of took a peek at your research . You took a peek ? You hacked into highly classified government files . I 'm all puckered . You know , imagine my surprise when I discovered that you had done nothing to help him . In 12 years , nada . - I thought he was dead . - Oops . Wrong . Now you can help . Don 't tell me you don 't want to . I know you have guilt . Look at me ! I don 't . Whatever helps you sleep at night , Professor . - You all right ? - I 'm fine . Lay off . Yeah , you 're fine . Sure . The nosebleed is , what , just for fun ? Damn it . I 've been jamming for answers . I 'm just a little burned out . And then I 'm just gonna guess that it 's getting a little worse ? Okay . It 's like three or four times a week now . It 's just stress . You get stressed , you get the flu . It 's not the flu , dummy . You 're so close to this , you can 't see it 's your connection to the experiment - that 's making you sick . - No , please . It 's just ... It 's just ... Rheticus was attempting human teleportation , so was Joshua . It 's beyond dangerous . Look , it 'll be ... a little easier for me to see what you 've got if you took off the cuffs . When love is lost and loss oe 'rtakes me , the rules of love then are hidden ; and chaos rules and order lost , and hidden then , my heart , from love . - What is that ? - Nothing . Nothing . It 's not important . A compass . Rheticus claimed he owned it , only no one ever saw it . It says here it probably never existed . It 's just ... folklore . Okay , now , is it just me , or does that sound all artifact-y ? You 've got the Feldkirch minerals , and you 're using an electrical field , but what about the rest ? The compass , it disappeared with Joshua . My question is , what are you using instead of the compass ? Aren 't the minerals enough ? It 's the same as the metal in the compass . It 's the same thing . You can 't just replace an artifact with , you know , something else . - There 's always an " x " factor . - Which is maybe why I need your help , Which is why you shouldn 't have done this at all . I 'm shutting you down . - You said you were gonna help me . - What I said was I would look , which I now have . And believe me , shutting you down , that is helping you . Fine . You know what ? Fine . Just do it . Just shut me down . You abandoned him once . Why shouldn 't you do it again ? - It isn 't like that . - Oh , no , it 's exactly like that ! Joshua and me on our own again . It 's a good thing I 'm used to it . I know that it hasn 't been easy . No , it hasn 't been easy . He was all I had after our parents died , and then he was gone too . He spent his fun years sewing girl scout patches and teaching me how to fold an omelet . And then reading Maria Looney on the red planet to me every night . He was a genius who put his life on hold for me . None of that 's your fault . I opened a door to wherever he is , and now he 's in pain . You saw his face . That is my fault ! Me ! I 'm the epic fail . Claudia , it is making you sick . I owe him ! And so do you , and we 're running out of time . Damn it ! Help me save Joshua . - It 's a pay phone . - What ? Pete , how are you ? How you doing ? - Artie , hey , man ! Are you all right ? - Ask him where he is . Yeah . No , I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I 'm here with an old friend , that 's all . Very good . You ready my lips using the durational spectrometer ? Where is he ? Wait . He probably doesn 't know . Right . Artie , do you hear anything like a freeway , machinery ? Train whistles . Ask him if he hears any train whistles . The truth is that I 'm helping her . - You 're helping her ? - He 's helping her ? You 're helping her , Artie ? I figured that you 'd be halfway towards finding us , but you can stop now . Did you hear me ? You can stop . No , Artie , she 's been under observation at a psychiatric facility , all right ? I had no ... Poor kid . I didn 't know . Not poor kid . Poor Artie . She 's obsessed with you . She 's obsessed with the Warehouse , and I 'm not letting you stay with her . What ? You 're not letting me ? That 's really cute , Myka . Cute ? Cute . - She 's cute ? - Does she have a gun on you ? These kids ' lives were messed up by ... They 're in trouble . I can help . That 's all you need to know . - Well , let us come and help you . - No , no , no . We have everything we need to make this work , - and I 'm telling you I 'm fine . - Wait ... He hung up . Let 's just get back before Frederic finds out we 're gone . Seriously , if Mrs. Frederic can call us , we should be able to call her . Is there a star 69 on this thing ? Star 69 wasn 't invented when that was made . No , this wasn 't invented when this was made . Why doesn 't Artie want us to help him , Pete ? - What 's going on ? - Yes , what 's going on indeed . Man , I really hate that . I believe I told you to stay put . No , I know , it 's just that we were going to ... You know , it would be nice if we could contact you . We had a lead . We decided to follow it . - Don 't make her angry . - What kind of lead ? - Artie is with Claudia Donovan . - Voluntarily . Do you know where they are ? It 's possible . But we 've got bigger fish . You need to get down to the Warehouse floor . Find the San Anselmo grid on the larkspur shelf , number 1021 , section 40594904 . Wait , we have a right to know where Artie ... Ms. Bering , your right extends exactly as far as I say it does . If Artie is working with Claudia , he may be trying to re-create her brother 's experiment . - And that 's bad ? - Where do you work ? - The Rheticus compass . - Yes . His experiments were successful . That 's why he didn 't disappear . - And Joshua did . - Yes , something went awry . You have to glean how Joshua went wrong 12 years ago . - I still don 't understand why you ... - What ? Tell you where he is ? If you run after Artie governed solely by your affection , you won 't be helping him . I don 't think it 's a bad thing to care about Artie . He needs information , not emotion . You go empty-handed , the experiment ends up just as it did before . You 're merely two more lost bodies . Thank you . So what are we looking for on the San Anselmo grid ? I 'm not certain . But every artifact in this Warehouse is an extension of a person . Understand Rheticus , understand the compass . And for the record , I care a great deal what happens to Artie . " Glean " . You 're lucky that I have an emergency travel kit in the trunk of my car . Well , " serendipity " is my stripper name . So without the compass , what I 'm hoping is some of these will be able to help us get a much stronger electrical charge than what you get using conventional means . Now , to electrify the Feldkirch minerals to a higher frequency ... Ben Franklin 's lightning rod . - I thought his thing was a key . - No , no . Everybody fixates on the key . Please . This is much , much better , trust me . What about ... That 's terrifying . Listen , I heard about the psych ward . I had no idea . I 'm sorry . Yeah , well ... It 's his journal . Take a look . Joshua 's ? See , this . That 's the rubbing at the edge ... Useless . Useless . Useless ! Useless . I 'm guessing Artie thought these things were useless . I mean , they 're all ... Rheticus gadgets , but none of them tripped Artie 's trigger . So Joshua had to follow all these rules to try and make the compass work , right ? The kid even figured out this complicated differential equation . - He was a genius . - And the compass still didn 't work . Well , it half worked . What is that ? It 's engraved with the letter " T " . - " T " ... Why not an " R " and why " T " ? - I don 't know what it means . Artie 's notes said that Rheticus ' work often expressed a need for order . So what did Joshua miss ? Maybe he translated something wrong , or ... I don 't know . I don 't know . Maybe . What are you doing ? - Rules and order , right ? - Right . Okay , well , after spending the last couple of months with someone who also likes those things ... - You know , crosswords , puzzles . - I like puzzles . So ? So ... So did Rheticus . A secret panel . I 'm increasing the power of the electrical field here by about 17 times where you had it , so you might wanna stand back . Standing isn 't really an option right now . - You all right ? - Super . - What ? - Artie , he 's almost here . I know . I ... I feel a ... I feel ... Feels like ... something familiar . Listen , I know , I know , I know . It 's all ... It 's all folklore . I know this place . I know this place . Professor ? I 've found all of the instructions . I have the equation for the field . - I have all of these things . - Nobody believes that he succeeded . I mean , it 's probably just a bedtime story , Joshua . That 's what you think . Joshua doesn 't get the concept of being nice to the money guy . Do you want the professor to recommend you for the grant or not ? See , Claudia here doesn 't get the concept of being ten . - Joshua , please don 't do this . - It 's okay , professor . He may be antisocial , but he 's very smart . - He knows what he 's doing . - Does he ? This . This is his compass . I know I can recreate what Rheticus did . - It 's teleportation , professor . - Please don 't . Trust me . I started having the dreams two years ago . It 's what got me started on all this . It 's because we were both here . Hang in there , kid ! This should be a good first run ! May be able to slow him down with this one ! Yeah , I got it . Hold ... Hold on . Man , this guy was nuts for secret panels . Yeah , and they weren 't mentioned in any of Claudia 's books . And if she didn 't know , it 's a safe bet that Artie and Joshua didn 't know . - You see the writing around the edges ? - Yeah , it 's Latin . Let me guess . - You speak Latin too . - Okay , make one more nerd joke , and I 'm gonna point out how you 're losing your hair . Okay , so the rules , right ? The rules are in Latin , and rules teach us how to use the objects . So Joshua took them off the compass himself . Yeah , but he was missing something . Rheticus hid some rules . And Joshua never saw them . Nice . I 'm not losing my hair . You don 't have it high enough yet . I 'm stuck . No , Joshua , I can help you ! No , Claudia 's tied to this now . It 's killing her . And you , you 're tied to this now too . No , she 's the one I 'm worried about . If you come back ... twice more , I can hold you here ! - I can save you both ! - No , will you look at her ? This place is growing increasingly unstable , and it 's getting worse . Next time I show up here , it 'll kill her , okay ? Listen , you have to cut the tether . All right , overload the electrical field . - The conductor you 're using ... - The lightning rod ? Yeah . Blow it up . Just use that . No , that 'll destroy the whole ... It 'll kill you , Joshua ! I know . You can 't save us both . To save her , you have to kill me . Do it before I 'm pulled back here again . So there 's something hidden on the compass . And we think it 's the rule that Joshua missed . - Nicely done . - Right , yeah ? Now check this out . In Artie 's notes , it said that Joshua had everything he needed - for his experiment , in his lab . - Where it was locked up for 12 years . But before Artie hung up , he said that he had everything that he needed . Bing , bang , boom . Claudia took Artie to the lab . You took the initiative , and recognized what needed to be done , all in Artie 's absence . I 'm pleased . I know , right ? Score ! Why the test ? - Was Artie going somewhere ? - Let 's hope not . The directions are in the file . You should get to that lab and quickly . We don 't know how much time we 've got left . Do you think she 's weird ? I think she 's weird . She always acts weird . Joshua come ... Come and gone already ? Craptastic . Well , at least we 're closer to bringing him back . - Okay , you all right ? - Yeah , no , I 'm fine . - Listen . - Yeah ? Thank you . Teleportation is such a powerful weapon , and people want it , Joshua . - They 're gonna come get it . - I think I 've solved the equation . - Listen to me . I could just lay low . - Listen to me . The people ... The people that want it , want it now . They 're coming after you right now . There 's no time left , Joshua . What you have to do is you have to ... protect yourself . Just protect your family . Just give me the compass temporarily . I know exactly where to put it where it 'll be safe . It 's in my Professor 's office . Good . You stay with Claudia till I get back . I 'll just be a minute . - Thank you , Professor . - Sure . - What are you doing ? - I made a promise to your brother , and I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you . What ? We 're blowing this up . That 'll kill Joshua . Artie , you have to put that back . You have to have the field ready to catch him . No , no , no , no , no . That 'll kill you , and I don 't care ... if you hate me . - I 'm not gonna let you die too . - I do hate you . I 'm never gonna forgive you . - He 's on his way . - Good . That 's good . What 's wrong ? - Nothing . - Yes , something . What ? It 's just your brother . He should be back by now . You know what ? Why don 't we go check on him ? Don 't worry . I won 't let anything happen to Joshua , I promise . I don 't have much time before it starts again . I 'm sorry ... for everything . But I 've gotta save one of you . Showtime . Showtime . I told you not to do this ! I told you not to follow me . Okay , well , dock our pay . We came here to save you . - Is that Claudia Donovan ? - Yes . She 's just unconscious . What ? What ? Joshua didn 't have all the rules , Artie . - Rheticus loved puzzles . - And his designs had secret panels . It 's inside ? It 's inside the compass . Yes , in Latin . Where is it ? Artie , where is the compass ? We just have to pop open the panel and find out which rule it is , so where is it ? I don 't ... I don 't ... I don 't have it . I had to try , Artie . I couldn 't give up without trying . Once you said there was no more time left , I had to prove I could teleport . Artie , what are you doing ? - I 'm doing what Joshua did . - No , no ! That 's how he died ! He 's not dead . I think I can save him . I thought what I have to do ... Don 't do this ! Artie , make him stop ! - You promised ! - Claudia , it 's okay . Remember , I will always , always ... Artie , what 's happening ? It 's not over . Touch my hand . - Where the hell are we ? - Claudia , Artie , you 're here . Look at you . You ... I can 't believe you 're here . Yeah , I 'm here . I 'm here . Wait . I 'm here ? You took me to the inter-dimensional space ? You were supposed to get him out , d-bag . No , he was supposed to destroy it . Clearly , he 's insane . Children , don 't fight , please . I can be both a d-bag and insane . - Just where 's the compass ? - It 's right there . All right . Rheticus put rules right on objects , sometimes inside objects . A hidden panel . Yeah . In this case ... It requires a combination , but they didn 't mention a combination . - Wait . Letters or numbers ? - It 's letters , but ... - How many ? - I mean , there 's 20-something letters . Try T-H-O-M-A-S . - Why ? - " Thomas . " Rheticus wrote a poem , The Loss of Reason , about his lost love , somebody named Thomas . Thomas , okay . How did I miss that ? Ah , Latin . Oh , crap . It 's fine . I can read it . It 's just directions . It 's just , " Move the dial 90 degrees towards axis . " I 'm no expert , but maybe hang on ? Okay , touch ... . Are you okay ? Thought we lost you , buddy . Thanks . Thanks for not giving up . Shut up ! So the secret-panel thing ... I gotta say , very nice work . Well , we were motivated . You know , maybe you should ditch us more often . I 'm really sorry about that . If you ever do that again , I 'm not finding you , and I quit . Yeah , just out of curiosity , by the way , how exactly did you figure out the secret-panel thing ? Well , each artifact is an extension of the person , Artie . We gleaned what we needed from the person . Mrs. Frederic . I thought so . No , hey , hey , you know what ? She 's pretty scary , man . If we hadn 't found something , she would have glared us to death . Yeah . You have no idea . What ? It 's just ... It couldn 't have been easy losing someone on the job like that . It wasn 't . You know , if you ever wanna talk about it ... I don 't wanna talk about it . You know , unless you wanna talk about it . I mean , unless you wa ... Look , anytime you wanna talk about it is fine , okay ? Hello , Mrs. Frederic . An in-person visit . Must have done something right ... or wrong . It 's a little of both . - I had to go back . - I know . I was responsible ... Back then . You wanted him to teleport ? Oh , I thought he could do it . I knew it , so I pushed him . And he was lost for 12 years . And you might have prevented it all ... And I might have saved Gus , but I didn 't . We make mistakes . Some people are lost . We can 't save everyone . Something to keep in mind regarding Mr. Lattimer and Ms. Bering . - That 's not why I 'm here . - Then why ? The girl , Claudia ? We didn 't do a very good job of protecting her , did we ? Well , she was determined to find her brother . And in the process , she learned a great deal about the Warehouse , which could become problematic . She wouldn 't hurt us . But others might . And ? You know what the options are .

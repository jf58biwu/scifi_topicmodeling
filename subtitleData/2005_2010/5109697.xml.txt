There is significant bruising and abrasions . Do you know him , ma 'am ? Yes . His name is ... His name is Alexander Cirko . Alexander C-l-R-K-O ? Mind if I ask you a few questions , ma 'am ? Not at all . I 'll tell you one thing . That wasrt no car accident . You see him two days ago , y 'all swap war stories then bam , hit-and-run . Come on , that doesn 't sound a little weird to you ? Cirko just told me he was bringing me into the investigation . Exactly . That 's what I 'm talking about . You 're almost in and he gets in an accident ? Come on , now . You know what ? Let 's try to get out this way . Miles ! Miles , get out of bed . It 's one in the afternoon ! Okay , okay . Jeez , Nim . What did you do ? Oh , my gosh . Nim , I told you , not in the house . He 's gonna sleep the whole day away . Nim , stop . No play . Nim , no play . Stop that , boy . Let go ! Miles . Stay . Well , I was beginning to think you 'd gotten bitten by a tsetse fly . Um , I didn 't sleep so good . I don 't blame you . It smells horrible in there . Why don 't you clean out the pigsty ? Yeah , okay . And you promised to sweep out the garage today . No , I 'll do it . Jeez , Nim . Stay in there . I 'll be back . Well , I 'm actually walking out of the house right now . Yeah , so , can I call you later ? Yeah , oh , that .

Please leave me a message . Come on , come on . Come on , come on . The rest of you all , down in there . We have an intruder in Corridor F. I see him . That way ! You need to watch ... Move ! There he is . Hold it right there ! Hey , hey , hold it right there ! Block on three ! There he is . Go ! I got him ! This way ! Take this way . Okay , go . Careful . Yeah , I got it , I got it . That 's right , go ! Go ! Yeah . Yeah , you think ? This way , everybody ! There he is ! Get there . Get to that ... It 's armed ! This is Security 3 , we 've got a breach on 4 , taking south elevator . Look for an exit on south ... All right , what does it say about Cirko ? " Cirko was a maverick among biologists " whose critical refinement of Darwirs Origin of Species " polarized the scientific community . " Well , he more than just polarized it . I mean , he was stripped of his chair at Berkeley for his theory of spontaneous equilibrium . " And cast him as a defiant outsider " for the latter stages of what was once a bright academic future . " That 's right . Well , guy had enemies . Definitely was not an accident . Can you get me some salt ? Yeah . Where is it ? On the counter . Hey ! What you got there ? Jesse ! Jesse ! It 's time for dinner ! Jesse ? Jesse ! Jesse ! Jesse ! Mom , look ! Jesse ! Never do that to me again , you hear me ? Do what ? What did that man say to you ? What did he want ? He wanted to know where to fish around here . Have you found Dr. Singh ? We haven 't been able to locate him as yet . But you 've taken care of the recovered research ? Yes , sir . Packed up and shipped to DC as you requested . We 're organizing a team debriefing for lower personnel . There is one issue , however . What is it ? Videotape from the lab showed that Singh might have gotten away with the specimen , some kind of marine flora . Find Singh . Recover the specimen . It 's of the utmost importance . I understand , sir . Oh . Oh , my God . Phil ? Phil . Don 't let my mom see us together . From now on our friendship 's gotta be covert . But why ? They think you 're a bad influence . So that 's how it is . A little adversity and you just throw me under the bus ? I 'm grounded , man . I 've never been grounded before , ever . Not for anything . Well , if it 's any consolation , Nim 's back . Big whoop . The thing never liked me anyway . Is that my dad 's car ? What 's he doing home ? Mom ? Is Dad home ? Yeah . Why do you suppose that is , Miles , huh ? Whoa . Is it here ? Huh ? What ? The thing . Is it here ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Miles , I can 't listen to this anymore . I 've had it . Your dad and I both have . Mom , if you just gave him a chance ... What did you say ? If you only met him ... I did meet him , Miles . He was in my kitchen cabinet . This isn 't about your lizard . It 's about your lying . I am very disappointed in you , Son . I 'm up to my ass in depositions on a Saturday . The last thing I need is your mother calling me up , hysterical , in the middle of a work day . I know , Dad , I 'm sorry . Sorry isn 't gonna cut it anymore . I 'm tired of sorry . I wouldn 't do that , Dad Son of a bitch , the teeth on that thing . He wouldn 't hurt anyone . It 's in the floor , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? It 's in the floor . Miles , out of the way . Out of the way . Promise you won 't hurt him . It 's already killed a poodle , Miles . What do you want it to kill next ? A baby ? Your sister ? Don 't answer that . It 's in the walls now . He 'll come to me . I trained him . You can 't train a lizard , Miles . He 's just scared ! I trained him to do a lot of things . He fetches , and he can do these jumps out of the pool . This is all a big joke to you , isn 't it ? You 're 14 , Miles . You 're too big for pet lizards . Time to start acting like an adult . I 'm trying . Like you were trying to tell the truth ? Honesty is all we got , buddy . That 's it . Without it we 're strangers . Just go to your room . Please don 't hurt him . Just go , Miles . Now . Well , come on , you think you can take the champ ? Let 's have it . You think you 've got what it takes to take the belt ? Come on ! You 're biting my hair ! I got the suplex and the body slam . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Look , look , look ! It 's us ! Hey , hang on , buddy . Hang on . ... with us now , an eyewitness . Now , tell us , what did you see ? This huge thing . I don 't know what it was . It had orange eyes ... Oh , come on ... really smooth skin like a salamander 's . Are you seeing this ? It 's not the first time I saw it ... Salamander ? I know . ... at the river road at the mouth of the bay . Also , on a day of the new moon . These creatures are connected to the zodiac . Oh , that poor , poor woman . Well , whatever it was , it was selling a lot of T-shirts . For now , News Three , Michelle ... Hey . Hey , man . Hey , you all right ? Huh ? Come on , now , buddy . Wake up . Oh , my God . Do you know him ? Yes , he 's Krishna Singh . He 's an evolutionary biologist . He 's Cirko 's right-hand guy . I 'm not getting a pulse . Oh , my God . I feel sick , Rich . I really do . I can 't even ... Hey , hey ! Everything all right out here ? Hey , hey , there 's been a bad accident ! Could you please call us an ambulance ? Sure , right away . Try to open from the inside of that door . Let 's try to get that door open . Just reach in with your hand . There 's a little handle in there . Hey ! Hey ! He wanted you to have this . Just take it easy , man . Just take it easy . We could just throw it into the ocean . We could . Forget that we even got it . Walk away . You know , call the police , let the authorities deal with it . Yeah . The authorities . Like Cirko and Singh . You know , whoever hit Cirko and killed Singh , they want what 's in this locker . And we go sniffing around , we 're fair game . Not only us . I mean , our families , too . Yeah . Walk away . I can 't . And this ain 't just about my brother anymore . There 's something more . I can 't explain it . But I couldn 't go back to hawking insurance policies if I tried . I understand if you want to do something different . Have you taken a look at the house upstairs ? Yes , I have . Yeah , you know what that 's gonna cost to replace ? I know , and I don 't know who to trust . I don 't know ... You know , where do you start with him ? I don 't know what 's got into this kid , but it 's out of control . I 'll tell you that right now . Well , that 's why we need ... I think ... Word to the wise-ass . You might want to stay in your room . What are they doing ? Uh , wondering how they ended up with such a defective son . Just so you know , boys and their creepy animals , you 're supposed to have outgrown that by now . Did Dad find him ? That 's what you 're worried about ? That thing ? Did he ? You 're hitting puberty and going completely insane . Mom and Dad are only trying to help you . You 've heard the horror stories of affluent kids with a sense of entitlement , right ? Yes , yes . I just don 't want that to happen to Miles , Ron . Yeah , well , we 've already given him too much . Way too much . First it 's lying , then he 's sneaking out , getting drunk with his buddies , then he 's dealing pot . Yeah , well , I didn 't have half the advantages he 's had . Half . Well , look what he 's done with them . I just think we should at least explore other options , that 's all . Like what ? Well , something ... Outward Bound , Maybe military school . Something that will teach him character , discipline . I didn 't even know where he 's going with this whole thing . I don 't know what 's wrong with him . I don 't get it . But we 've got a decision to make . Are we gonna be parents or are we gonna be friends ? Well , where do you draw the line ? Come on , Nim . He 's 14 years old . Line 's already drawn . Okay , we definitely need to find you a new crib , 'cause , well , we may have just been voted off the island . Which , you know , in a way , I understand . What did you do ? Ate some salt . And a poodle . Which , yeah , I guess is wrong . But , swear to God , Nim , I really don 't see that we 're the big problem here . Don 't worry . We 're gonna stash you someplace safe . Hi , Cheryl . Hi . Hi , Laura . Sorry to intrude . Sean , hey . How you doing , buddy ? How you doing ? Fine . Hey , how you doing ? Rich Connelly . Oh , sorry . This is Rich , my friend who I ... Sean . Sean , a pleasure . ... told you about . He 's the one who saw the ... The new vertebrate . The new vertebrate . Right . That 's right . So , I heard about your job . What happened ? Something about plagiarism or ... It 's an allegation , Sean . She was framed . It 's really ... Things are really complicated right now , and I think it would be a good idea if Jesse stayed here . There 's a body outside our house . A body . You wanna tell me what 's going on , Laura ? Look , Laura believes the government is covering up the existence of a new species and is killing people to do it . Well , it 's not that extreme . Laura , come on . Well , it is that extreme . I mean , the situation is really extreme . And I think the same thing , too . For what it 's won 'th . But , Sean , I know how this looks , and I know how it sounds . But I wouldn 't do it if I didn 't have a reason . Hey , Jesse , why don 't you come on in and I 'll put you to bed . Yeah , okay . That 's a good idea , right ? Hey , you know how much I love you , don 't you ? Infinity ? Infinity plus one . Promise me you 'll find it . Okay . Tomorrow we do this . Let 's go . Not bad , right ? Me and Phil come out here sometimes . It 's like a hang out . You know , Mom and Dad aren 't usually like this . They ... They just gotta get used to you , that 's all . I got to go . Yes , sir , that 's right , he 's been gone for about five or six hours . Yes , I understand , but he 's never run away from home before . Yes , sir . Okay , thank you . Don 't worry . He 's a smart kid . He 'll be okay . Here , here , here . Wow . Trees and lots of cover . Good place for a sniping . Can you shut up and help me with this thing , please ? Here , here , here . That 's it . That 's it . Stop , stop . It 's stuck . It 's stuck . All right , all right , all right . Oh , my gosh . Well , I 'm not really good with small spaces . I 'm a girl . Oh , come on . You 're a girl who drives submarines and tags little sea critters ... All right , all right . Get your butt in there . If I don 't come out in 10 minutes , call the police . Yeah , yeah . Shoot , if you 're not back in 10 minutes , I 'm calling an air strike . All right . Stay cool . Rich , there 's something in here you 're not gonna believe . You gotta see this , Rich . Rich , you gotta see this . You 're never gonna believe what 's in here . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , Daughtery ! Come on ! What are you doing ? I need you to pull me in . There 's somebody coming ! Yeah , but you won 't fit . Yeah , but I can 't even , I mean ... Come on , get me in there ! Somebody 's coming ! Wait ! I gotta get in there ! Careful ! Look , I gotta go . Nim , I 'll be back , okay ? It 's just that , I don 't know , I got school , and my parents . I don 't really want to think about my parents . Look , I need you to stay . Stay ! Oh , man . God , they must have been watching us the whole time . Don 't you think we should come clean ? I think we should come clean . These are not people that are gonna listen to reason , you know what I mean ? Well , we don 't even know what kind of people these are . What we need ... Ha , ha ! We need a weapon . Are you sure we shouldn 't just go out there and just , you know , pretend like we 're totally meant to be here . We 've got keys . I mean ... Look , I 'll tell you what . You talk . I 'm gonna hit . We 'll see who gets out of here . What the hell am I supposed to do with this ? Use your imagination . Hey , the car 's gone . He 's gone . Yeah , just a little bit paranoid , I guess , huh ? No , you 're not . That 's what they do . That 's their technique to get you out into the open . What are you talking about , " technique " ? How in the world do you know what their technique is ? I 'm an oceanographer , and I spend a lot of time on boats reading spy novels . Wait a minute . Just a second ago , you 're talking about reasoning ... Yes , then I remembered that I got framed , and that Cirko is in ICU and that Singh is dead . Just because you 're paranoid doesn 't mean they aren 't after you . over that way . You sure ? Look , they switch off in a second . It 's gotta be ... It 's jammed . Give me a hand with this , all right ? Ready ? One , two , three ! You folks having any trouble ? Supposed to check in at the guard station . Uh , yeah . Sorry about that . Almost called the police but I figured I 'd come , have a look-see . Well , we 'll sure make sure to do that next time . Sorry , buddy , promise . Okay ? Thank you , boys . Feel like an idiot ? No . No more than usual . Hey , it 's a funny-looking thing , ain 't it ? It 's the research . Hmm ? What ? What research ? Mine . He used my research to track the migration patterns . Don 't worry , Mr. And Mrs. Barnett . The boat is gone , you know he 's on the water . I 'll find him . Be careful with him . Please . There . There he is ! There he is now ! Miles ! Miles ! Miles ! It 's okay ! Miles ! Miles ! Miles , come back ! Stop ! It 's the police ! Don 't scare him ! Don 't scare him ! Miles , it 's all right . Miles , nobody 's gonna hurt you . Miles , you 're not in trouble ... Miles , come back ! Miles , come back . Don 't scare him . Don 't scare him ! It 's okay , honey ! Nobody 's gonna do anything . You 're not in a lot of trouble right now . Turn around ... We 'll talk through it , sweetheart . It 's okay , just come back . Sweetheart ? You 're not in a lot of trouble right now . If you just stop and turn around , we 're gonna be fine . We 're gonna be fine ! Miles ! Come back . It 's okay . Just come back . Okay , Nim . Time to go . It 's not gonna be safe much longer . Get in . Nim , get in . Come on , Nim . Crap , dude , you scared the bejeebs out of me . Good , maybe you 'll start acting normal . You 're parents are wigging . How did you find me anyways ? Did you see where I hid the boat ? How many times have we come here , idiot . It wasrt that difficult . Where did you put your bike ? Right next to the " Find Miles Here " sign I posted up on the road . Okay , okay . I just wanna make sure they don 't find us . Are you okay ? They 're gonna take him . They 're gonna take him . Oh , but we ... Look , we gotta put him somewhere . We just ... We gotta leave . Have you got any money ? My little sister just had a birthday . She 's sitting on maybe $ 100 . Okay , I need it here . I had almost $ 300 stashed up in my bookcase if Nim didn 't shred it . Son , you probably think you 're in so much trouble right now , things can 't get any worse . But that 's not accurate . Now step away from that thing . You can 't take him . Is he dead ? We gotta call 911 . Dude ! Take him . Take him ! No , no , that 's terrible . I 'm sorry . Thank you . Yes , thank you for calling . What 's up ? Cirko passed away . The police are calling it a homicide . No , Daughtery . No , what are we doing ? This is my house . I 'm not leaving . No , wait , get in the truck . There are laws . This is my home . I do not have to go . Laura , get in the truck , now ! Come on !

In trouble now , mate . Damn ! You star , you did it ! I was that close ... No , you got it . I 've lost him , Tosh , I 've lost him . I swear , whatever it is ... You 're holding it . Let me check the cameras . BEEPING SHE BREATHES HEAVILY FOOTSTEPS STEAM TRAIN CHUGS Hello ? Who are you ? Can you hear me ? I want to go home . No-one knows who I am here . I 'm lost . Come back ... Come back . ANNOUNCEMENT OVER TANNOY I 'm sorry , that damn gate cut us off . Gwen ? Are you all right ? I 've just seen a ghost . This is the feed from the station camera . Gwen grabs the kid . She 's got his jacket , and he just slips out . You OK with this ? And then ? Jack and Owen arrive . Then , nothing . Sorry . No . It was as real as this is . More real . I didn 't just see that boy . I could ... I could hear what he was thinking , I could feel it . Like I was lost . Intense emotion can be part of a neurological event . Hallucinations , dementia ... I wasn 't hallucinating , Owen . And I 'm not bloody senile . You pushed this button which caused this apparition moment ? Yeah . Jack , please don 't ! THEY ALL SHOUT " NO " As if ! But that 's how it felt . Like an apparition . A ghost . Toshiko , where do we start ? The guy you were chasing , I 've got lots of CCTV , so tracking him down 's gonna be easy . You said there was a name on the card around the little boy 's neck ? Flanagan . Tom Erasmus Flanagan . Unusual name , that 'll help . Run a full check . Births , marriages , deaths , criminal record , passports . However long it takes , wherever he is , we 'll find him . I 've found him . Flanagan , Thomas Erasmus . 74 Brynaeron Terrace , Butetown . He 's in the phonebook . Hi , I 'm DI Cooper , this is DS Harper . Could you spare a few minutes , please ? Yeah , OK . Dad , visitors . It 's the police . Oh ! Caught up with me at last , have you ? I 'm Gwen . This is Owen , he 's training . It 's just routine - we 're looking for eye witnesses to an incident at the railway station last night . We were here , weren 't we , Dad ? Strictly Come Dancing finals . Who won ? That newsreader . She 's got legs up to her armpits ! Would you like a cup of tea ? I 'd love one , thanks . Owen will give you a hand . This way . She 'll talk him to death out there . He 'll give as good as he gets . She was right , though . We were in all last night , we wouldn 't have seen anything . Just for the record , you are Tom Erasmus Flanagan ? My father was an Erasmus , his father before him . Now , that 's not a Welsh accent , is it ? No . Lived here 66 years , and still sound like a barrow boy . I was evacuated during the war - 1941 . The Germans bombing the hell out of the East End . Cardiff was being bombed as well as London , wasn 't it ? We were taken to the countryside . My mother packed me a suitcase ... Big sister wrote my name on a card . They put me on a train at Paddington . Kept saying I had to go , had to be a good boy , telling me not to cry , and the pair of them were crying their eyes out ! That was the last I saw of them , though I didn 't know that then , of course . Waving goodbye . How old were you ? Eight . You must have been very , very frightened . I didn 't know a soul here . And there was a mix-up . I kept my head down so much they forgot all about me . So they left me all on my own . Felt like the end of the world . I wandered down this tunnel , totally lost . Forgotten . Looking for someone , anyone , who 'd look after me . " Why don 't they come for me ? " I kept thinking . No-one knows me . I 'm lost . They worked it out in the end , they came back for me , and I got taken in by a lovely couple , no kids of their own . And well , at the end of the war , I had no-one left in London . So I stayed here . I 'm still here now . Just ! I don 't get it . He WAS the boy at the station . I can 't comment - I was stuck in the kitchen with Motormouth , thanks to you . So was what I saw just a bit of him from years before ? Hanging around ? PHONE RINGS Hi . Gwen , I 'm just putting a wash on , you got any whites need doing ? I don 't know . Just leave it , I 'll sort it out . No , no , no it 's no trouble . Just remind me , which drawer do the tablets go in ? Ah , just leave it . OK , so , are you in or out tonight ? I don 't know . Again ? ! Sorry ? All I 'm asking is you in or out tonight ? I don 't know . I can live with all the Secret Squirrel stuff , but if you can 't even tell me if you 're coming home ! Well , nagging isn 't helping . Right . Well , that 's me told . Aw , Rhys ... I 'm not staying in on the off chance . Daf 's having mates round . I 'll stay there . Do what you want . CAR HORN BEEPS Hello ? All right ! ENGINE REVS Our friend with the alien machine in his pocket is one Sean Harris aka Bernie . And what he 's doing with an alien machine is anyone 's guess . 19 . String of convictions - burglary , shoplifting , credit cards ... Do warn me if he 's dropping in ( ! ) The theft conviction - he was stealing tyres off a car when the owner turns up , gives him so much grief , he apologises . starts putting them back on again . Which is when the police show up ! And here - shoplifting conviction . Bottle of vodka and three Pot Noodles . A criminal mastermind ( ! ) Got anywhere with that mystery object ? Alien , of course ... Gorgeous nanotechnology , makes NASA look like Toys ' R ' US . Well , you 've really narrowed things down , haven 't you ? At the station it was doing this . When I held it , it lit up and went mad . It 's not doing it now , is it ? No . So . What next ? This kid , Bernie , where does he live ? Splott . Splott ? I believe estate agents pronounce it " Sploe " . Hi , I 'm looking for Bernie , is he in ? Friend of his , are you ? Yes , I 'm from ... I 'm his mother . He 's a robbing little bastard who won 't set foot in here till he pays me the Â£ 50 he owes me ! He 's barred . He said he 'd get me a iPod and he never . And he smoked my fags . Wouldn 't piss on him if he was on fire . Bernie Harris , the Scarlet Pimpernel of Splott . Tell me about it , give me aliens any day . Any luck ? Nope , but I got four pasties for a pound - anyone ? If I wanted days like this I 'd've stayed in the police . We did try , Jack . What 's he gonna tell us ? " Got it off an alien down the market . " Where are we going ? To the station . Controlled experiment . We replicate the original events as far as possible . Observe and analyse the results . What I have to do that again ? ! Someone does - any volunteers ? Whoa ! We don 't know what it is , what it does . Nope . Jack , this could be dangerous . Yep . Don 't mean to be picky , but I think I can spot some flaws in this ... I 'm sorry , I thought you gave up looking for a 19-year-old kid this morning ( ! ) I figured maybe you were after something more exciting . A bit of a challenge . This door-to-door stuff never gets us anywhere . BEEPING Guys , come here ! Owen ! Owen ! Wait ... ! THUNDER RUMBLES RAIN WOMAN WEEPS He 's a rotten bastard ! My mam was right , his eyes are too close together ! I said , " Just a dance , " but he wasn 't having a bar of it . I shouldn 't have gone outside with him , I should have known better ! What 's your name ? MAN CALLS MENACINGLY : Lizzie ! Lizzie Lewis ... You 're a bad one , Ed Morgan ! The girls said not to go with you , and they were right . Am I bad ? Am I a bad boy ? You 're a big girl now , Lizzie . You can make your own decisions . That 's why I like you . You 're not like the others . You don 't follow the herd . You 're smart . Don 't you like it that someone can see how smart you are ? Hmm ? I can see you , Lizzie . The way you really are . SHE SCREAMS I don 't want to hurt you , I don 't ... I-I told my mam I 'd be home by 9 ! Shhhh ... PLEASE ! Oh , God , someone help me ! Help me ! Help me ... ! Owen ? Are you all right ? She ... she was so scared ! I-I-I couldn 't ... I couldn 't move ! I couldn 't help her ! The first time , it happens to Gwen . A boy , at the railway station . Who 's now in his 70s , alive and well , and living in Butetown . The second time it happens to Owen . Like me , you didn 't just see it , you felt emotions that weren 't yours . She was terrified . The victim 's name was Lizzie . It was maybe 40 , 45 years ago . Toshiko , do we know anything about her yet ? Elizabeth Lewis . Lizzie . Only child of Mabel Ann Lewis of Hafod Street . Died March 29th , 1963 . Raped and murdered on Penfro Street , under the bridge . 17 years old . He killed her . No-one was brought to trial . She told her Mum she 'd be home by nine . So what about Ed Morgan ? That 's what she called him . " You 're a bad one , Ed Morgan " Look him up . It 's kind of a common name . What 's the connection ? Where did they come from ? It 's like being haunted . Quantum transducer ! Look . Wow . I 'd kill to get one of those . Transducers convert energy from one form into another . They 're in headphones . They convert electrical signals into sound . They 're in this device too converting quantum energy and amplifying it . Into ghosts ? Of course . It 's emotion . Human emotion is energy . You can 't always see it , or hear it , but you can feel it . Ever had deja vu ? Felt someone " walk over your grave ? " Ever felt someone behind you in an empty room ? Well . There was . There always is . A ghost . What else have we got on Lizzie Lewis , what else have we got ? Um . 1963 - the records aren 't always that detailed . What about newspapers ? Witness statements , coroners ' reports . Owen ! What do you want me to find ? To re-open the case you need new evidence , or a new witness . I saw it happen . You didn 't ! You weren 't there . You saw the echo of a moment , amplified by alien technology . So just tell me how that will play in court ? Since when did we care about court ? Tomorrow we look for Bernie Harris and find out what he knows about this ghost machine . We do our job and find where this thing came from . Now , go home . Gwen ! With me ! Jack ? Whoa . You need to know how to use these . Though I hope you never have to . So , do I ... SHE LAUGHS I 'm sorry , it 's just ... I don 't even kill spiders in the bath . Nor do I , not with a gun . It 's all yours . Target 's that way . Right . Let 's leave the roof in one piece , shall we ? One hand , not two . Turn sideways to the target . Looking along your shoulder , down your arm , a straight line to the sights . Bring up the gun . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Too fast . It 's all in the breathing . Hold it firmly , don 't grip it . Breathe in . Focus . Breathe out . Squeeze gently . ( Wow . ) That was a joint effort . Try it again . This time on your own , and remember , breathe in . Don 't grip it too tight . Hold it and cock it back . I didn 't cock it right . Nice and slow . Up a little . Yeah . Breathe first , then go . You know how to do it . Two hands or one ? One . Woo-hoo ! Wow ! Nice work ! Like I said , I hope you never have to use ' em . Yeah . Oh , God , look at the time . When do you get to go home ? You seem to live here . You don 't , do you ? Gotta be ready , the 21st century 's when it all changes . And I hate to commute . Where do you sleep ? I don 't . Doesn 't it get lonely , at night ? I 'd better get back , Rhys 'll be wondering where I am . Goodnight . Goodnight . Hello ? DOOR SLAMS 'Hi , it 's me here , I 'm at Daf 's 'playing poker , and I 'm winning ! Ha-hey ! 'Look , just so you know , erm , 'I-I-I put your whites on earlier , even though you were bloody grumpy . 'They 're still in the machine so you 'll need to hang them up . 'I 've out the bins out , but I didn 't do the washing-up . 'But there 's not much of that so ... and you haven 't done it for weeks anyway . Ha-ha ! 'I 'll see you when I see ya . Ta-ra . ' ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS THUNDER RUMBLES SINISTER CALLING : Li-zzie ! WOMAN CRIES Lizzie Lewis ... You 're a bad one , Ed Morgan . Are you the-ere ? The girls said not to go with you and they were right ! Am I that bad ? Li-zzie ... Am I a bad boy ? WOMAN CRYING Lizzie Lewis ... Help me ! Help me ! So , I 've got to stay out of trouble now , have I ? Best behaviour . I 'm a fully-trained police officer , I 'll have you on the floor and handcuffed like that . Mm-mm ! Promises , promises ! I 'm so proud of you . CAR HORN BEEPS Rhys ! The taxi 's here , we 're gonna be late ! I haven 't worn these since the Luckley 's interview . I 'll wear jeans with a shirt and tie . It 's mum 's 60th . She wanted us smart , that 's the whole point . I bust my zip ! I 'll be flashing my family allowance if I 'm not careful . What are you doing ? Come on . You 're joking . I 'll staple it ! You 're not coming near my valuables with that . Hiya . Daf and Karen had a barney . She 's making him sleep in the spare room . I didn 't fancy the sofa . Look , I don 't mind you working all the hours . I really don 't . As long as you still want to come home at the end of it . I do . I 'm here . And you 're gorgeous . Bet you haven 't hung the washing up . Let 's leave it till tomorrow , eh ? Aye . Who is it ? Mr Morgan ? What do you want ? Well ? Mr Morgan . I need to come in . Who said there was gas ? I can 't smell anything . There 's nothing wrong . I 'd have noticed . Can you smell anything ? Was it next door ? Can we go into the living room , Mr Morgan ? There 's nothing in here . No gas fire , I mean - I haven 't got one . There 's an electric heater . I don 't hardly use it . What are you looking for ? Sit down , Mr Morgan . Was it next door ? She can 't mind her own business . Something wrong with her . She makes stuff up . Is it her ? You won 't find anything , if it is . It 's all in her head , know what I mean ? What 's your name ? How long have you lived here , Mr Morgan ? Years . This was my mam 's house . You 'd remember your neighbours . People who lived in this street a while ago ? People who lived ... just round the corner ? Like in Hafod Street ? Like ... Mabel Lewis ? She only passed away a few years ago , did you know ? Of course , she 'd moved away long before that . Couldn 't bear the memories . Her daughter . Her only child . Died in ' 63 . HEARTBEAT Lizzie . Little Lizzie Lewis . She loved dancing . Do you remember ? You should . Pretty girl . Blonde hair , blue eyes . Used to wear a little pink coat . Bet she saved all her pennies to get that . All the rage . She was wearing it last time you saw her . Last time anyone saw her . Alive . Remember now ? ( I know what happened under the bridge that night . ) ( Just the two of you . In the dark . ) ( Water dripping from the roof into the canal . ) ( Lizzie 's hair all wet from the rain , cold and crying . ) I know what you did , Ed Morgan . And here you are , just ... living your life ... free as a bird . Lizzie told her mother she 'd be home at nine . " Please don 't , " she said . " Please . " PLEASE ! " You 're a bad one , Ed Morgan . " " The girls said not to go with you , " and they were right . " Get out ! Get out ! GET OUT ! You thought you 'd got away with it ! You 'll get nothing from me ! I told you before , you 'll get nothing ! Get out of my house ! Get out of my house ! Bernie Harris ! Oi ! You mind out ! Sorry ! Sorry ! Go on ! Kick his head in ! Mam , there 's a man in the garden ! There 's TWO men in the garden ! Bernie Harris ! Who ? That wasn 't a question . Don 't hurt me please , I got asthma . I 'm not going to hurt ya . I 'm going to bloody kill ya . Why do they call you " Bernie " ? I burned my neighbour 's shed down when I was 12 . Why ? I was having a fag . Got a bit carried away . Well , this IS cosy . I hope he bought you flowers . If this is about the dodgy fags , I don 't know what happened to ' em . Well . It 's worth knowing , we 're probably the only people you can tell . Me and a mate was using this lock up , down on Moira Street . Used to belong to this old guy . Soft in the head , he was . Still loads of his stuff in there but we chucked most of it . There was this old biscuit tin full of foreign coins , weird bits of rock , and that . Thought it might be worth something . Take it down the Antiques Roadshow . Yeah ( ! ) You don 't know . Cash In The Attic , all that . So I takes the tin home with me and that thing switched itself on . It makes you see things . Real things . Real people . I was down the Old Wharf , in the bay . I seen this woman , with a bundle , something wrapped up . It was night time . She was putting it into the water all secret like . It was weird cos it was like I was her , somehow . She was scared , because she knew what she was doing was wrong . I knew , without seeing . It was her baby , wrapped up . Dead . She hadn 't told anyone . Then she just ran away . And I realised , I KNEW her . She 's old now , but she lives up by the Catholic Church in Splott . So I goes up to see her . Told her what I 'd seen . She give me money not to tell anyone . You blackmailed her ? She offered . I 've seen things you wouldn 't believe . There 's the old bridge , on Penfro Street . I saw a man ... and a girl , from ages ago . He was following her back from a dance , along the canal ... Yeah . I know , I saw it . He doesn 't know anything , does he ? It 's been fascinating meeting you . Where you going ? That 's mine ! You can 't walk off . I 've got rights . So you don 't want the other half , then ? The other half . Weird bits of rock . Foreign money . Alien rock . Alien money . Driftwood , washing in through the rift . So , Bernie . Was this thing in two halves when you found it ? I 've got it ... Like clicking Lego together . You split this into two pieces , didn 't you ? C 'mon , you lot . We 'll take these too , if you don 't mind . Come on , you lot ! Aren 't you gonna arrest me ? We 're not the police . But I stole it . I know . And you 're going to rob it back off me . So call the cops . Don 't go ! I only used it once ... .. That half . Anyway I couldn 't use it again . Why not ? I 'm going to die . I 've seen it happen , out there on the road . I 'm just lying there , bleeding , and then I die . Just like I am now , not old . What do you mean ? Come on , Gwen ! I 'm gonna be 20 in July . Do I die before then ? GWEN ! Just wait there , I 'm coming back . Jack ! Jack ! Jack , I need to speak to you . Gwen , no-oh-oh-oh ! Hello ? Help me , please ... I was too late , I couldn 't stop it . Stop what ? He 's dead . Owen had the knife . He wanted to kill him . Owen ? Oh God , I couldn 't stop it ! Help me ! Christ , Gwen , what were you thinking ? I didn 't see him . I didn 't see anyone but me . I just said his name . Owen . Bernie said he saw himself , dead in that street . You saw Owen with the knife . But I was holding it . My hands were covered in blood . That was one future , one of many possible futures . Whatever you saw , what Bernie saw , might not happen . Might not ? ! Can 't we find out ? You 've got all this stuff , alien stuff - isn 't there anything that can help ? I 'm sorry . I wish we 'd never found it . Poor Bernie . Seeing himself dead . He might not be . Possible futures . He might like to know that . You 're certainly finding it a comfort ( ! ) I don 't know what to do . I found your Ed Morgan earlier - did a trace . I found him too . Phone book . Took all night . But I found him . Paid him a visit this morning , put the fear of God into him . What did you find ? His medical records . He 's claustrophobic , paranoid , depressive , got a couple of recorded attempts of suicide . He 's barely left his house in years . Look Owen , if Jack finds out ... Well , he won 't , will he ? PHONE RINGS Hello ? I think he thought I wanted money . He kept saying , " You 'll get nothing from me . " Paranoia . Yeah ... He said , " You 'll get nothing from me . Leave me alone . " I 've told you before . " Told who ? 'Look , I 've seen things you wouldn 't believe . 'There 's the old bridge , down on Penfro Street . 'There was a man ... and a girl , from ages ago . 'He was following her back from a dance along the canal . ' KNOCKING Bernie , it 's Gwen . Can I come in ? Thanks . I know it sounds mad , but just because you saw yourself ... Dead , yeah . Doesn 't mean it 's gonna happen . But you don 't know how to stop it . For you , or for me . It 's got right into my head , this thing . Some things you 're better off not knowing . PHONE RINGS Jack ? Ed Morgan . Owen went freelance earlier and paid him a visit . Wanted to frighten him . Sounds like he succeeded . I think Bernie Harris got there first . Tried to blackmail him . Bernie was blackmailing him ? ! Looks that way . Ed thought Owen was part of the same outfit . Are you home yet ? No . I 'm at Bernie 's place . We 're heading over , stay right there . Owen , with me ! Tosh , keep an eye on CCTV , in case Bernie makes a run for it . So you saw Ed Morgan assaulting that girl and thought you 'd make some money out of it . " Diagnosed with severe depression . Agoraphobic . " No . I don 't believe this ! PHONE RINGS 'Jack , I 'm on CCTV ... and I 'm looking at Ed Morgan . ' What ? Where is he ? Coming onto Evelyn Street . That 's Bernie 's street ! He 's heading for Bernie 's flat . What , are we expecting someone ? Where are you going ? Bernie , Bernie ! PHONE RINGS Jack , yeah , what the hell is going on ? We 're on our way , are you OK ? Yeah , I would be , if someone would just ... just tell me ... I 'm gonna die . I 've seen it happen , out there on the road . Bernie said he saw himself dead in that road ? Gwen ? ! Gwen ! I knew you 'd find me in the end . I knew you 'd come for me . I 've been waiting for years . Have you come for me , too ? I used to see it in people 's faces when they looked at me . They knew ! I tried to hide , but ... they knew . I haven 't been outside for so long . Edwin ... Little bitch . You 're all the same ! You 'll blame me , make me the bad one ! Edwin , put the knife down . I 've wasted my life for you . We won 't tell anyone , no-one else will know . Stay calm . I won 't say a word . You 'll never see me again . I promise . I know . That 's why I came . It 's what you want , isn 't it ? Got him ! Got the knife . Are we OK ? ... ARE WE OK ? ! Yeah , yeah , we 're OK . ( I 've got the knife . ) I 've got the knife , Edwin . You were so close . You were going for her , weren 't you ? Just like with Lizzie . I 've got the knife , Edwin . You were so close . As close as I am now . Owen had the knife . He wanted to kill him . Why should you get away with it ? Owen . You said you were sorry , that you didn 't want to hurt her , but you didn 't stop . Owen ! What if I didn 't stop ? Would I be sorry ? Owen , NO ! I don 't know . Go and deal with Bernie ! No-one died . You stopped it from happening . You got here in time ! I knew you 'd come for me . Oh ! He 's arresting ! Help me . I was too close , I couldn 't stop it ! Oh , God ! ( Oh , God ! ) I just - I just ... I couldn 't stop it . He wanted to die . He would have found a way , no matter what . I screwed up , I know I did . But um ... I didn 't kill him . I could of , but I didn 't . No . I did . Tosh is right . It could have been anyone . What about that ? The problem with seeing the future is you can 't just sit and look at it . Got to try and change things . Make it happen differently . It 's not meant for us . All these ghosts . We 'd be lost . Sun 's nearly up . Ianto . Secure archives ? Come on . I killed him . I 've still got blood on my hands . He killed himself . Come on , Gwen . Look - the sun 's coming up . A new day . The city 'll be awake soon . All those people . All that energy . All those ghosts . We 're surrounded by ' em . We can 't see ' em , we can 't touch ' em ... .. but they 're there , all right . A million shadows of human emotion . ( We 've just got to learn to live with them . ) What 's happening ? Internal power drain . Who the hell is it ? It 's wrong . It 's beyond wrong . It shouldn 't be here . We have found parts of a Cyber conversion unit fully powered up and working . ( I 'm deadly serious ! ) Oh , God , there she is ! She 's still alive ! You execute her .

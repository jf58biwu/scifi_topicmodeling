 In my flash-forward , I was investigating what casued all this . I seemed to have an idea why all of this was happening . We know you were planning an attack . - Tell me what happened ! - We didn 't do this . You were still planning on killing thousands of people . I think God did this to punish us . I 'm a little at sea in dealing with Dylan 's condition . He 's autistic . This man means nothing to me . I 'm not gonna cheat on you . On March 15th , 2010 , you are going to be murdered . ¶ Shh ¶ ¶ Shh ¶ ¶ It 's oh so quiet ¶ ¶ Shh ¶ ¶ Shh ¶ ¶ It 's oh so still ¶ ¶ Shh ¶ ¶ Shh ¶ ¶ You 're all alone ¶ ¶ Shh , shh ¶ ¶ And so peaceful until ¶ ¶ You fall in love , zing , boom ¶ ¶ The sky up above , zing , boom , ¶ ¶ is caving in ¶ ¶ Wow ! Bam ! ¶ ¶ You 've never been so nuts about a guy ¶ ¶ you wanna laugh , you wanna cry ¶ you cross your heart and hope to die ¶ ¶ Till it 's over ¶ ¶ And then ¶ ¶ Shh , shh ¶ ¶ It 's nice and quiet ¶ ¶ Shh , shh ¶ ¶ But soon again ¶ ¶ Starts another big riot ¶ It 's okay , you 're gonna be fine . You 're gonna be just fine , okay ? What we 're gonna do is on one , two , three , you 're gonna take a big breath with me , okay ? One , two , three . I wish I could have saved more people . I reached the surface , did the Australian crawl to the shore , and then I walked home . Oh , and then I , you know , realized that the whole world had blacked out . That was two weeks ago . This is the first time you 've seen a doctor ? Yeah , didn 't need one till now . Okay . Well , Mr. Ned , I- - You can call me " Edward . " - Edward . - Wait , you know ... Call me " Ned . " my friends call me Ned . Ned Ned ? Yes , yes . Uh , how did you stay so calm ? I don 't know . I just was . It says here that triage gave your morphine for your pain . - Does that mean- - - Let me tell ya . They should call that stuff " mor-fine " 'cause that 's how I 'm feeling for the first time since the crash . Well , why didn 't you come in sooner ? It didn 't start off so bad . You know , I thought I 'd maybe just bruised my spleen or somethin ' . Okay , Mr. Ned- - Um , Ned . Whatever . Uh , I think with your low blood count and your pain , we should keep you in for observation and a C.T. scan , all right ? It 's all gravy , Dr. Benford . Truly . Okay , good . Now after the blackout , do you remember what- - Hey , your flash-forward- - What did you see ? Not where I was goin ' . You really wanna know ? I was rocking leather pants . I 've never rocked leather pants . ¶ Atomic dog ¶ It 's always been one of my top three fears , along with clowns and escalators . But there I was , rocking out at this bar that I 've always wanted to go to but I 've never gone to because I-I thought I 'd be too nervous , that I 'd be ... Well , too nervous . But it wasn 't that way . I was happy . I was at peace . ¶ Atomic dog ¶ Oh , and I was black . Wait , you were ... - Black in six months ? - Yeah . Like Oprah . You know , African-American . Black . Okay . Okay , Mr. Ned . Well , okay . We 'll see you later , Mr. Ned . Okay . Yeah . " Black Swan " So they 're your parents , so I think you should be the one to tell them that we moved up the wedding . Uh-huh . Though I 'm sure a free to trip to Hawaii still won 't make up for the fact that I 'm not Korean . Right . Okay , where have you been for the last 20 minutes ? I 'm fine . It 's just work stuff . Work stuff . I 've been trying to trace a call from , uh , an informant . - Is everything okay ? - Yeah , I 'm here . Okay . Well , speaking of work , can I ask you something work-related ? Are you guys gitmo-ing a suspect downtown ? No . Some blonde , arrested the day of the blackout . Bin Laden in Prada ? I can 't confirm or deny this , Zo . I think you just did , sweetie . Wow . Look , professionally , if the bureau 's violating someone 's due process , that 's uncool . But personally , if that woman has anything to do with the blackout , I really hope you 're getting all Dick Cheney on her ass to find out what she knows . Ladies and gentlemen ... As Eggbert , I would like to egg-xpress my desire for you to eat oatmeal this morning . You 're silly , daddy . Silly ? - Can I get a " cluck cluck " ? - Cluck cluck ! Cluck cluck . Thank you muchly . I believe you know my mum . Oh ! - Oh . - Aw , Eggbert ! Wow , you really are the Shakespeare of cheesy dad humor . Ah , you could play , too . You could be ... ze french toast . Ze toast of love . - Good morning . - Good morning . Hey , mommy . Hi , sweetie . So guess who 's picking you up from school this morning ? - Nicole ? - That 's right . Nicole . She missed you . She 's ready to start babysitting again . Yay ! - Yeah , Nicole is coming . - Yeah , Nicole is coming back . Thanks for breakfast . First time in a while I 've been out acting like a normal person . I know what you mean . You want an ice cream or something ? Where was that place Tracy used to take you when you were little ? They turned it into a giant juice - when I was a freshman . - Hmm . She spent all the money she made babysitting you buying you milkshakes . I should get going . It 's my first day back at the Benfords ' , so I don 't want to be late . Mark told me you went A.W.O.L. I 'm sorry , Aaron . You got me that job with them , and I totally screwed it up . If that were true , they wouldn 't have asked you to come back . You know , Nicole , you 're not alone . Everyone 's freaked out by this . But I think we have to surrender to a higher power and have faith that whatever we saw , we saw for a reason . So make Cowbell Lady N.P.O. We 'll take her to the O.R. if she spikes again . Yeah . And , uh , what happened to the scan we- - Oh , come on . Come on ! Ugh ! What did the scan show on our bus crash guy ? - Yeah . Ned ? - Mm-hmm . Oh , I-I can 't stop thinking about that guy . I mean , how does somebody possibly go from being Caucasian to African-American ? I mean , if--if that 's the vision that he saw in his future , - then I guess- - - Ugh . Bryce , I need you in the present . - Here , now . - Yeah . You know , patient care , doctoring , C.T. scan . Still don 't have it . E.R. ' s got a bunch of traumas . They keep bumping Ned from the scanner . So I ran into Dr. Flemming earlier . Who ? Blythe Flemming- - the psychiatrist you 're supposed to be following up with every week ? Yeah , well , it 's just , you know , I 've had my rounds and , um ... Come on . Less than a month ago , you were standing on a pier with a gun . Look , I know how it sounds , - But trust me , things have change- - - If you wanna keep working here , you need to follow up with psych at twice a week . - You got it ? - Yeah . Excuse me , ohh ! Bollocks . Hey , honey . Sorry . You know what ? That Simcoe kid is awfully tuned out . I wanna transfer him to physical therapy . Yeah , but he 's on I.V. antibiotics . Just as soon as you can , okay ? - Yeah . - And I need that scan of Ned 's , so wheel him to the scanner yourself if you have to . Okay . You wanna go to Somalia now ? Last week , you talked me into flying you to Germany - because of an index card . - And it paid off . Mm-hmm . You found out some crows died in Somalia 18 years ago . You know , your definition of " paid off " is a little different than mine . If a blackout had happened before , that 'd be major . I agree , which kind of makes you wonder why we haven 't heard about it before . Evidence , Stan . There is evidence . Last I checked , all you 've got is a footnote in a C.D.C. funding request . I have been working with Mark on trying to get satellite photos of the region from ' 91 out of Langley . They 've been giving us the runaround , so- - Maybe the CIA 's just a little busy these days to dig through satellite intel from last decade . Guys , I get it . Germany didn 't exactly work out , and you 're trying to stretch a single into a triple . I get it . But going to war with the CIA is not the way to do it . Hey , Al , remember that hacker we busted ? You know , the one who broke in the D.O.D. ' s network , trying to take our overseas drones for a joyride ? Mr. Cheeto Dust ? Yeah , that 's him . Don 't you think he 'd find Langley 's mainframe a delightful challenge ? Yeah , he 'd find it delightful . It 's illegal . Whoa . Spying on your own country ? That 's more than some procedural jujitsu . You 're talking about a federal offense . Yeah . You 're right . Where 's Demetri ? Uh , he brought that hot blonde terrorist over from holding . - He 's questioning her now . - Why ? I don 't know . 'Cause she 's hot ? I 'll repeat what I 've said many times . My name is Alda Hertzog , and I 'm an honest businessperson . Yeah , we caught you doing business on the day of the blackout . Remember ? With known terrorists , selling them weaponized nuclear material . Then charge me with a crime . You can 't hold me here indefinitely . You 're right . You should call your embassy and complain . Which embassy is that , by the way ? We wanna know 'cause , uh , we wanna get you the right phone card . I 'm truly flattered that you still feel the need to talk to me after all that 's happened . But I 've done nothing wrong . It 's my associates who you want . Honey , your associates died on the day of the blackout . They were super dead . So you wanna give me somebody else ? Customer Choice restaurant group . It 's in Indio . Town comes up a bunch of times in wiretaps , but we never found out the significance . Customer Choice restaurant group . That 's all I have for you today . You 're running out of time for this to continue being a civil conversation . Really , Agent Noh ? Here I thought you were the one running out of time . What 'd you say ? You really should get out there before it 's too late . I 'm not- - I 'm not getting this . Instead of following up on the Somalia lead , you wanna reopen the dirty bomb case ? We never closed it . And Somalia is not a lead . It 's an urban myth , at best . Meanwhile , back on planet Earth , - we have a material witness- - - In a weapons deal . That broke on the day of the blackout . Okay , so maybe it 's not as sexy as dead poultry in Africa , but you gotta admit the timing 's a little hinky here , Mark . - It 's a coincidence ! - So what if it is ? It is a legit lead on a terrorism investigation , which is kind of what we do around here . Agreed . Send me a postcard from Indio . Okay . What the hell 's the matter with you ? I just want to be an FBI agent today . All right ? Life is short . Thank you for putting up with me . Hi , Mr. Simcoe . I 'm afraid I 'm the annoying parent who always wants a thousand details . I 'd like to apologize for that . I can tell it makes you uncomfortable . No , it doesn 't . Doesn 't make me uncomfortable at all . I 'm sorry about the little outburst this morning ... The tantrum in the hallway , the ... unidentified flying meal tray . It 's his autism . I-I really don 't know what to say to him when he 's like that . Oh , sometimes you can 't say anything . You just have to be there . Thanks . Thank you . Yeah , unfortunately , I haven 't really been there since our separation . You know , work picked up and , um ... Well , I barely know him . Well , you 're here now . It 's what counts . A good night 's sleep might help . Yeah , well , despite the luxury of two rigid plastic chairs in Dylan 's room , the Sandman has proven a bit elusive . Well , you shouldn 't be sleeping in his room every night . Well , actually , the ... police brought me the keys to his mother 's house . I just can 't bring myself to go there for some reason . Well , you should try . Maybe being in Dylan 's room , around his things ... It might give you some sense of who he is . Too much time in the hospital is not good for anyone , Mr. Simcoe . You hang in there . Hey , Dr. B. , I-I got that scan that you wanted . I was just gonna grab a veggie dog - while it prints out . - Transfer Dylan Simcoe to physical therapy . - But I thought you wanted him to- - - P.T. can handle the antibiotics . Just transfer him . Okay . I don 't understand what all this is about . Welcome to my world . This restaurant came up in a confidential investigation . We need the names and addresses of every employee . The list , please . Thank you . Burgers and waffle fries- - That 's all we do . Well , for now at least . We 're going to be adding frozen yogurt - in , you know , the future . - So this place is owned by Customer Choice restaurant group ? Uh , this place is Customer Choice restaurant group . Uh , we 're not quite a group yet . Would you give me and Agent Noh a moment , please ? Sure . Yeah . Uh , somebody get some burgers for these FBI guys , please ! Wow , I can 't believe I didn 't want to come here today . I mean , the intel- - - They 're adding frozen yogurt ! - Come on . Freeze ! FBI ! Aah ! Freeze ! Aah ! - Go left . I 'll take right . - Gotcha . Aah ! Come on . Give me your hand ! You got him ! Shut up , man ! - Where you running , man ? - Get up . Get up ! I thought we were just coming in for a burger . On your knees ! Get on your knees ! I heard what you 're being . FBI can be biting my ass ! Oh ! Hello ! Yellowcake uranium , Mark . Black market nuclear material . Or do you think we should leave it here , go back to your office and stare at your bulletin board ? You don 't be wanting this , yo . Hey ! Yellowcake . It 's the type of strain , the type of weed he 's slinging ' ! It 's the sickest strain 'round , yo . In my flash-forward , I 'm driving pimping ride . 19-inch rims , yo . I must be going to be Scarface of pot . You can 't be fighting fate , yo . - Shut up ! - Aah ! Aah ! Truth hurts , pig ! - Get off of me ! Get off ! - What are you doing ? ! - Burning his mouth ! - I 'm talking about today ! I 'm talking about you ! Racin ' around , looking for someone to shoot ! Just drop your personal crap and do your job ! Hey , I 'm doing something ! I 'm not sitting on my ass , waiting for clues to appear to me in my dreams ! Oh , give it a rest . This isn 't about what I saw . It 's about what you did ! March 15th . Three shots to the chest . I 'm not just gonna die . I 'm gonna be murdered . How 'd you find out ? Anonymous call . The woman said she read it in an intelligence briefing . That 's all she gave me . Mark , I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you , but I thought maybe I could find who 's gonna kill me or get a lead on them . I don 't know , but ... Why would you think there 's anything out here ? Alda said I was running out of time . That was it ? Yeah . Dem , Alda 's a pro . She knows you 're vulnerable , and she pulled a number on you . All I can hear is the clock ticking . Every day . What am I supposed to do ? Somehow ... you get past the fear and you fight . - How ? - You know what I saw . I 'm in my office , staring at the Mosaic board , and men are coming in to kill me . You and I are partners . If they 're coming to kill me , they 're probably after you , too , - or gonna be . - It 's the future , Mark . W-why do you think you can stop it ? Because we saw it . We can use what we saw to stop what we saw . Demetri , we can solve your murder before it happens . That 's why I wanna put everything we have on Mosaic . For you . For me . For everybody . Now can we get out of here ? Yeah . We can . Oh , excuse me . Hey , Mr. Simcoe . Stepping out for a bit ? Just , uh , following some advice . Oh . I think you left this in Dylan 's room . Oh , uh ... thanks . - She 's beautiful . - Yeah . Your girlfriend ? Um , we haven 't actually met . Coming up soon , a Glendale postal worker uses the Mosaic web site to meet the police officer he believes is going to save his life in the coming months . You won 't wanna miss this . But first ... Ah , it 's incredible , isn 't it ? A temporal anomaly in global consciousness . Yeah , I think that qualifies . So what 'd you see ? Oh , I guess this is the new " How 's the weather , " isn 't it ? Alright , then ... Why not ? Um ... I was in a house- - Uh , not my own house . I got a call from someone . I don 't know who it was , but it was urgent . Dylan was nearby , maybe in another room . I heard a woman 's voice ... - Hey , honey . - I turned towards it ... And it was over . Um , I never saw her face . But I knew that we were together ... That she was important to me somehow . I know exactly what you mean . Thank you . Um , excuse me one- - One second . I 'm sorry . Dr. Benford ! Dr. B. Dr. B ! - Ned 's C.T. - Oh , great . Whoa . Big hematoma . Blood 's been gathering around the liver since the bus crash . Ned 's lucky he showed up here in time . Well , n-no , it 's not luck . It 's ... I mean , he was alive in his vision . - So clearly he made it to the hospital- - - Oh , God . Enough about visions , - Dr. Varley . - No , Dr. Benford , - it 's relevant data . - It 's not data . It 's not data any more than the dream I had last night . Look , I-I don 't understand how you can ignore something that even the most skeptical people in the world think might be real . I 'm not ignoring the flash-forwards . I 'm just not bringing them into the practice of medicine . Now consent Mr. Ned for surgery and meet me in the O.R. Oh , with any surgery , there 's a risk of infection , blood loss , drug allergy and even death , Ned . It 's all gravy . You know , it 's okay if you 've got questions or if you 're worried . - Uh , this is a major surgery . - I get it . You 're telling me I need some sort of drug allergy-death surgery . I 'm totally cool with it . I mean , I know it sounds weird , but ... Some kind of change is happening . I mean , I don 't feel nervous or afraid of , like , anything . I mean , all that worrying all the time ... It 's just , like , kept me from being the me I 'm supposed to be . Six months from now , I see myself , and I 'm like , this invincible , fearless black guy , like Shaft or Bryant Gumbel . - Hmm . - And knowing that ... It 's already changed me . Oh . Yes . Yes , Rabbi Hirscholtz . Oh , 15 in the last 2 weeks . Four , uh , on Sunday , actually . I didn 't leave the cemetery until after sundown . Bye . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry about everything . I 've been so busy with everything . So how can I help you ? I , um ... Oh , I 'm sor- - I keep crickets . Oh , I really--I really like the way they sound . So , Paige , you were saying ? Paige is my sister . I 'm Nicole . - Oh . - I only come on Christmas and sometimes on Easter . But that 's gonna change . I , um , I wanna help out . I wanna start doing some volunteer work , in the morning before I have work and- - That 's great . Uh , but as far as volunteer work goes , we are full up . See , in a crisis like this , people--they really wanna ... Well , people need to help . Uh , why don 't you--why don 't you tell me what this is all about ? How do I atone for something I haven 't done yet ? Uh ... In my flash-forward , I felt like I was being ... punished . Do you think ... Do you think God made this happen ? Y-y-you know , it 's- - it 's really hard to believe that there 's not a divine hand involved somehow . Tell you what . This right here is Audrey Ridgeway 's phone number . She is the volunteer coordinator . I hope she can help . Here 's a T-shirt . Bye . - Where 's Ned ? - O.R. took him . When ? 10 , 15 minutes ago . What 's wrong ? Call the O.R. We 're about to kill our patient . We can 't operate . I couldn 't figure it out . I couldn 't make sense of it . But now I 've got it . Ned has Addison 's disease . Surgery could kill him . In the bus crash , he was calm in the face of an insane disaster . And again today , he spoke about his flash-forward . - Bryce , please . - And again he mentioned that he was weirdly calm and black . You better scrub if you want in on this case . If he 's got Addison 's , then his body is making melanin compounds instead of adrenaline . That 's why his skin is going to get dark . Yeah . I know what Addison 's disease is . And without adrenaline , his body can 't mount a proper stress response . That 's why he 's so serene - in the face of this surgery . - Ugh ! Bryce ! - And without the stress hormones , - Stop ! his body will be unable - to adapt to surgery . - No , without surgery , - he 'll die . - His blood pressure will tank and he 'll die . Listen . You 're not listening to me . In his vision , he saw- - Enough about visions ! He needs hydrocortisone . No , I 'm not administering a potentially harmful drug because a patient had a freaky dream . They are not dreams . Look , I don 't know what you saw , and I don 't care . But it is affecting your professional judgment , and it needs to stop . How about your professional judgment ? - Excuse me ? - Come on , Dr. Benford . You know why you don 't want to believe ... - in your flash-forward . - Oh , you don 't want to do this , Bryce . You said it yourself . You saw the end of your marriage . Oh , you are so out of line , doctor . And you sticking your head in the sand - is gonna end up killing our patient . - No . You know what 's gonna kill our patient ? Wasting any more time arguing because he 's lying on that table continuing to bleed . Now that 's not from a Magic 8-ball or a Ouija board or some kind of vision . Right here , right now , that 's real . Don 't bother scrubbing in . ¶ Oh ¶ ¶ Look what you 've done to me ¶ ¶ I 'm ¶ ¶ in pieces around your feet ¶ ¶ And no ¶ ¶ Don 't take back what you said ¶ ¶ She ¶ ¶ She 's on an aeroplane ¶ ¶ While I ¶ ¶ Yeah , I just learned how to stay ¶ ¶ Yeah , it 's all very well ¶ ¶ It 's all very well ¶ ¶ But is it love ? ¶ ¶ Oh ¶ ¶ Look what you 've done to me ¶ Retract the duct a little more laterally . Suction . Anyone make it to grand rounds today ? This guy from Yale says he can enhance memory of the flash-forwards - using a calcineurin antagonist . - Yeah , I was there . Pretty cool . - Yeah . - Irrigation , please . B.P. ' s 78 over 54 . Stay clear of the hepatic artery . 800 ccs out . Guys , systolic 's in freefall . Must be another bleeder somewhere . Or some kind of fluid shift . Get another unit on the rapid infuser . - Tributary 's ligated . - Run of 6 . 100 of lido right away . He 's in V-TAC . - No pulse . - Damn it . Code cart and a mig of epi . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Lido 's in . Where 's the cart ? Where 's the cart ? ! You 're charged for 360 . Clear . No change . Going again . Clear . Come on . - Fourth epi 's in . - Chase it with lido . - He 's had five rounds . - Amiodarone then . This makes no sense . This makes no sense at all . 100 migs of hydrocortisone . I.V. push . He 's got adrenal crisis . He 's got Addison 's disease . What ? Nobody bothered to tell me this ? He hasn 't been diagnosed yet . Addison 's would explain the lack of response - to fluids and pressors . - Exactly . Hold compressions . Holding . Normal sinus . - Good carotid . - Nice catch , Dr. Benford . Let 's close him up . What do you know about Agent Noh 's murder ? His murder ? Something funny about that ? Just that I knew he didn 't have a flash-forward . I had no idea he was gonna be murdered ... till now . Then how did you know he didn 't see anything ? Because your partner posted it on the Internet . Because everyone in this office knows . Any particular reason why you felt the need to waste the time of the agents investigating the blackout ? In all likelihood , nothing I tell you will be the truth . So why persist in asking ? Asking questions is my job . So let 's start with a simple one . What do you know about the blackout ? That 's not a simple question . All right . You ever been to Somalia ? I can 't say I 've had the pleasure . What about Detroit ? Utah ? You 're wasting your energy on what caused the blackout , who 's responsible . You 're ignoring the most profound question of all ... Why ? Do you know what a black swan is ? It 's a metaphor used to describe a high-impact event ... Something so rare it 's beyond the normal realm of human expectation . It comes from the 17th century when scientists assumed that all swans were white . They were wrong . Fascinating . " There 's a room . A small boy enters with a candle . " What is this , a bedtime story ? It 's a Sufi parable . The man in the room , referring to the candle , asks , " Tell me where this light comes from . " And the boy blows out the candle and replies , " If you tell me where this light went , I 'll tell you where it comes from . " Cute . Your partner is right about one thing- - I commune with some very dangerous people . I 'm friends with those willing to don suicide vests in the name of ideology . I know when a man is willing to sacrifice anything for his cause . And you 're not that kind of man , Agent Benford . Even if you were to start asking the right questions , You 're not willing to do what it takes to get the answers . You 're that little boy , Agent Benford ... Alone in the dark . Hey , Al . - Hey , man . - Hey . Remember that hacker- - Mr. Cheeto Dust ? Give him a call . You sure ? Is Somalia really that important ? Yeah . It 's time I got out of the dark . Addison 's disease ? Who 's Addison ? Well , he was the guy who discovered the condition . It 's a hormonal imbalance that makes surgery very dangerous . But , uh , luckily , Dr. Benford realized it in time and gave you the medication that saved your life . Wow . Thanks , Dr. Varley . Hey , we should thank you . I mean , your flash-forwards helped us piece it together . If you hadn 't told us what you saw , you might have died on the table . It 's pretty cool . I wasn 't afraid , because I didn 't need to be afraid . The future saved me . Uh , Ned 's crit is- - is stable . - Look , about earlier , I , um- - - Yeah , I was completely out of line . Yeah . But you were also right . I just didn 't want to see what was going on with Ned ... 'cause of what 's going on with me , so ... Look , I-I-I get it . It 's what 's happening with me . That 's what made me believe him . Mm-hmm . Bryce , I haven 't pushed you 'cause you didn 't want to talk about the ... Me standing on the pier with a gun to my head ? I just want you to know that I 'm here ... if you want to talk . Thanks , Dr. B. , but , uh , I 'm gonna be all right . You really think you 're just okay now ? I know I am . The future saved me . Oh , uh , Dr. Benford ? Hey . I need you to sign the discharge on the rollerblade guy - so I can roll him on out of here . - Sure . Oh , and , uh , Dylan Simcoe 's white count spiked to 19 . Here 's his C.V.C. He was transferred to physical therapy . Can you give it to his attending ? The chief transferred him back . What ? P.T. said they couldn 't handle the antibiotics , so the chief put him back on your service . Are you okay , Dr. Benford ? Yeah . Fine . Hey , Nicole . Uh , Charlie 's just upstairs changing into her P.Js. All right . Um , we did some finger painting , and she 's all done with her homework , and , uh , we kicked around a soccer ball , too . Oh , and she had ants on a log for a snack . And how are you doing ? I feel bad for disappearing on you . Eh , everybody disappeared for a while . Some people aren 't even back yet . I guess I 'm just trying to figure out why you guys didn 't fire me . Nicole , you 're part of the family . Hey , what 's the matter ? You want to talk about what happened ? You can , you know . I saw someone drowning me . What ? I saw someone drowning me ... in my flash-forward . I saw someone drowning me , and I don 't understand , but I-I felt like I deserved what was happening . Like I had done something wrong , and there 's no other way out . I saw the man 's face who was doing it . He pushed me back down , and ... And then I was just gone . What did I do that ... I think I deserved getting killed ? You don 't know exactly what you saw or even how you felt . What kind of person doesn 't care they 're being murdered ? Nicole , I 've known you a long time . You didn 't do anything wrong , and you won 't . Tomorrow , I 'm gonna have a detective friend of mine from the L.A.P.D. come talk to you . We 're not gonna let anything bad happen . I 'm gonna do whatever I have to ... to make sure you 're safe . All right ? That person you think you saw ... That person you 're worried you might be , that 's not you . Do you think you could try to believe that ? Yeah . I can try . Good . - Hey , daddy . - Hey ! Come here , you . Oh ! - Moons Over Miami . You in ? - I 'm in . All right . Let 's get started . Are you staying ? Um , you know what ? I have to go . She 's staying . Breakfast for dinner ? Can 't beat that . - Come on . Please ? - Sounds great . - Get cracking the eggs , Professor . - Okay . - Can I have a bowl , please ? - One bowl coming right up . - Okay . - Here . - That 's silly . - Here we go . Okay . Gamanta , McGillicutty ... frog leg ! Do you want the coin back ? - Yeah ! - Say the magic words then . - Not again . - Are you ready ? See you tomorrow , Dr. Benford . Good night , Deb . Gamanta , McGillicutty , - frog leg . - There you go . Do it again ! Just once more ! I think my junior magician has to get his strength up before the next trick . How about some dinner ? Okay , Dad . I 'll be right back . Uh , you 're the , um , the eye of newt soup , right ? All right . Chicken , it is . Yeah ? We need to talk . Yeah , well , I can 't right now . Well , I 'm truly sorry about that , Lloyd , but talking to me is just one of those little inconveniences you 're going to have to put up with . Now that we 're responsible for the single greatest disaster in human history .

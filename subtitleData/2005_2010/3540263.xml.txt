 Previously on kings ... David shepherd , you 're under arrest . On what charge ? Treason . I 'm pregnant . Your father ... he has eyes for David 's blood . King Silas framed this entire case . You 're a traitor . You 're both traitors ! We act now . You did that ? For me ? I love you . A group will be meeting to consider the season . Do it . Silas is dead . Jack will be king . His first order will be to avenge his father 's murder . Don 't do this , Jack . I know it . He 's alive . Jack has named himself king . Cross is the real power . I am the king . [ On radio ] : king Silas offered his hand in peace , And gath bit it . Killing innocent civilians , murdering our king , And very nearly his successor . The prince regent Jack benjamin is alive and well And will be crowned sovereign . And while I can 't give details , Be sure that gath 's betrayal Will not go unanswered . Four of our generals and now our press minister . All loyal to us . Where one loyalist falls , Ten others will beg you for their position . You 're very popular , Jack . It 's a message . My father 's still alive And his teeth are still sharp . The panicked bite of a dying dog . Probably dead already . Just feels like he could just come back anytime . He 's not coming back . He 's one man against an army that answers to us . You 've been afraid of your father your whole life . Now might be a safe time to grow a pair And flaunt them . I can only put the crown in front of you . They need to see you take it . Sir . Sir , you should hear this . [ On radio ] : public opinion now firmly in favor Of military action with a reengagement of ... [ Silas on radio ] : people of gilboa , A few days ago , Our nation was a victim of a coup d 'etat . Your king was shot and the reigns of our country Seized by corrupt and evil men . My people , you have been deceived . I address you today to say that I , Silas benjamin , king of gilboa , am alive . Very much alive . I am still sovereign of this nation . I send a message to the traitors who would depose me . Who would subvert god 's will And the freedom of my people . I 'm the rightful king of this nation . I and no other . I will return to shiloh to take my place Given me by god and citizen . Like an earthquake , I will come . Silas is still alive . I told you he was tougher than any bullet . What did I say ? I said- - He 's got shepherd and thomasina with him . Yep . [ Sighs ] So are they still gonna have the ceremony ? Is Jack gonna take the crown ? He just had them polish it . He wants to be the new king . But we still have an old king . Can we have two kings ? Oh , boy . A man with much to consider . My whole life I 've waited for this moment . My chance to lead . To ... impress my personality on a country And make it better . Tomorrow it happens . But I--I don 't feel anything . It 's not there . You mean he ... Is not there . Shouldn 't he give me something ? Words of wisdom Or ... a warning , an image For a new standard ? My father had signs . Butterflies , whole conversations , Whatever to give him the confidence To speak in his name . What 's my blessing ? God does not take counsel ... With sinners . Recently you and I , We 've been made unforgivable . We both knew my father needed to go . And all the others . All the innocents shot dead . Your declaration of war . That 's william . But we allowed it . Silas was right . I cannot accuse him and let myself go unscrutinized . I can make good of our mistakes . Once you put the crown on my head , You will see how well it fits . The crown will never touch your head . That is the hollowness that you feel . And you know it . He knows it . And he will never speak to you . Why not ? [ Whispering ] you are not the one he wants . Jack . That 's enough . There will be no more debate on primacy . Silas ' threats are empty . We have the chance to rid ourselves of a tyrant . I 'll be crowned as scheduled in a touching ceremony To warm every patriotic heart . But , sir , If Silas is alive , he 's still king . Does anyone else stand opposed ? You 're worse than he ever was ! Is this who you are now ? You gonna shoot me too ? If you don 't sit . You could 've been better , Jack . You 'll have to shoot both of us . Get them out of here ! Keep them under watch . You never do that again . Jack and william are wrong . I won 't pretend otherwise . Yes , you will , Until Silas returns , and then you will pretend even more . The fate of this monarchy , this family , No longer lies with your brother . Jack will die the moment Silas returns . And if Silas and David don 't return ? I know your father . He 'll come . And you have to stay alive long enough To greet him with open arms . You keep your head down and your mouth shut . Tell no one of this pregnancy , especially David . And you 'll have nothing to fear . I 'll take care of everything . Everything 's set . You can 't drink with people you hate . Life 's taught me that much . Come on . Might be your last . So that 's it then ? We die tomorrow . Odds are not in our favor . Not like the old days . Then I was sure . I 'd ask the outcome of a battle , And he 'd answer in thunder , And the answer would always be yes . No answer tonight ? Not for some time . Hey , maybe we can help you out a little . Just let us know you 're listening out there , And that you exist and that you care a little For the back and forthings of we tiny men And that success or death In the outcome of battle Mean a little out there in the sparkly quintessence . Just knock the glass over . An infant could do it . A breeze . No ? I guess we 're on our own . Maybe he doesn 't talk to bastards . And here I thought we were getting along so well . I know you . Too well now . I 'll help you tomorrow . I 'll probably die too . But I 'll do it because the people need you . They have a chance at peace with you . If we do survive , I owe you more than apologies . I wronged you . The minute I see you in your chair , I 'm out of here . I don 't want to see any of you again . Do that . Just promise me one thing . If god ever does speak to you again , You 'll listen . Don 't . Curfew 's been established across all shiloh . Streets are secure . Every roof and corner . No signs of any disturbance . Hmm . Sir . Reverend samuels . He won 't come for the coronation . He knows I 'll kill him for this . He said he expects it . Fine . Send a team . Meet his expectation . Sir , what about the benediction ? You do it . How can the crown be missing ? It 's a national treasure , Blessed and locked in a vault . The national archives has arranged an alternate . A false crown and no reverend . Don 't worry about him . Samuels has already recognized you in public . You 're still his magically approved choice . This is happening , Jack . You 'll be king in an hour . Try to enjoy it . I read from the benediction of the reverend ephram samuels . " Our cause is just . " Our union is perfect . " As we unified our lands , Unify our purpose . " Forgive my eyes ... For what they have overlooked . Forgive my mouth ... For its pride . Forgive these hands ... For works done and works unfinished . If I die today ... I die knowing my offense . " Guide his eyes , mouth , hands . " That they see your goals , speak your words , Build monuments to your gifts . " Still think he 's coming ? Only let me live long enough To see my wrongs righted . I have walked before you ... From the time of my youth . Here I am . Let this crown be our every hand . There to lift you up in darkest moments . Do what your hand finds to do . Stand aside . What ? ... is with you . Don 't let him through . Shoot him . Orders are to fire . Prepare to fire . It 's gath . No . It 's him . William ... Bringing guns to a tank battle . Jack . Come on ! Stand aside ! Do not fire . Find my son . Bring him to the airfield . If you would see peace with gath ... And war ended , Stand aside ! Husband . Wife . I believe this is yours . Where 's our son ? You were gonna put this on Jack ? Sir- - Say there was a gun to your head , And I won 't have to put one there . So where are they ? William cross . Jack benjamin . Where are they ? I ask once more with words And then with blood . I 'm here . I 'm not gonna run . Not anymore . You said I couldn 't be what I was . God ... Said I couldn 't be what I wanted . There 's nothing left for me ... But to die . Do it . Go on . Finish it . I 'm ready . We can think of worse things for you than death . You could 've had everything . Everyone out . The plane is waiting . We have to move . Not without my son ! Silas is closing the roads . He 'll find us . We have to go now ! Sir , we found cross . He was just standing in the lobby Waiting for us . Where 's your father , andrew ? His plan was to fly to the calsays . He had a ship there waiting for him To take him to a home on the southernmost tip . When I came back , My father told me to watch and learn . So I did . I learned who should be king ... And who shouldn 't . Anything else ? You lost a son . I lost a father . Maybe I could be part of the family . David . You 're leaving . All I did was replace one corrupt king for another . You stopped a war . Who knows how many lives you saved ? I can 't live here . Back home , things were either right or wrong . David , hey , We can go away together . What about your family ? You are my family . You really mean it . You 'd leave everything behind for me . You stood by me when your blood took another side . I 'd reward that anything you ask . No . No need . But there were others , kept their heads down , Did nothing . I would like to see to their sanction . It 's you . Silas . Not bad , right ? Even you must be impressed today . You 're welcome . I give , and I am thankful , For giving is a need . We understand each other on the point . It was a mad idea you had in the first place . Kings ? A monarchy ? In this day and age ? I 'm looking out at a city that I built In your name . This is what you wanted . Deny it ? [ Thunder booms ] then you can forgive me . Then ... I still have some role yet to play . Oh , thank you . Thank you ! Whatever you want , I am ready ! Him ? But why ? No . No , what about me ? What am I supposed to do ? ! Don 't go ! Don 't go ! Sir . Find shepherd . Bring him to the mansion . Tell him I listened . Sir . Captain . You said I could go home . You were asked for . Seems god has plans other than you might 've wanted . Get used to that . He spoke to me again . He told me ... You were meant to take my place . Me ? No . No , I 'm no king . It 's not up to you either . But why ? I don 't know why . Because you 're good . I 've been good . Because you 're young . I was young too . Oh , I gave him that , everything he ever asked for . But now he turns away . Loves you . I don 't know that he does . You have his favor . I doubt I could 've escaped the traps I laid for you . You never knew what you were being given . But now ... Now I see . How long has he been whispering in your ear ? He hasn 't . No ? You didn 't feel anything ? Hmm ? Before your butterfly crown ? After ? Don 't lie to me . I never asked for anything . He did come to you . Offered himself behind my back . Yours for the taking . Shameful . The two of you laughing at me . No . God loved you . And so did I ! I listened to your lies while you were playing me ! The old fool , huh ? Is that what you thought ? Huh ? Is that what you thought ? God looked me in the eye ... And lied to me ! You backstabbing , cheating whore ! You 're jealous ! That 's why he left you ! Maybe I should be king ! Maybe I should ! David . What happened ? He 'll never let us go ... Ever . Reverend ! Reverend ! Reverend ! Here I am . I didn 't know where else to take him . Silas did this to you . He thinks I 've stolen god 's favor . You haven 't , David . God gave it freely . I don 't want it . David shepherd , Son of jessie , son of judah , know this . You were chosen To be the new king . It 's true , isn 't it ? Where can I take him ? His only place of refuge ... You cannot follow . Gath . Silas would never look for you there . Gath ? I 'll--I 'll be alone . I 'll have nothing . You need fear no evil . You , David , are never alone . As long as we 're together , You 'll be in danger . I can 't risk you . You have to stay here . Take this . Wear it . And know that I will always love you , No matter what . Always know that . I will never stop loving you , Ever . I 'll be back for you . I 'll be waiting . Husband and wife if you like . Vows of love exchanged before god . You two were married long ago . And you will be married for evermore . I 'd pictured prison colder . She had no part in this . Her part she 'll be glad to play . You father wants for you a living death , To brick you into a wall With someone who loves you , Who you can 't stand the sight of , Until you produce an heir , Which Silas will take and raise right this time . I ... don 't understand . Thomasina , love . Please . You 've known me since I could crawl . You went against the family . You 're not charming anymore , Jack . Don 't do this . It 's not so hard . Just close your eyes and dream of someone who 's dead . Mother , I- - Oh . An issuance of the king . For her acts of treason in support of her brother , Michelle benjamin is ordered exiled from gilboa . Stripped of any rights as citizen or noble , Removed from all our lands , And kept from any company but her own For a period of no less than one year . What are you talking about ? [ Whispers ] I told you I would take care of everything . All our plans . We 'll make new ones . We 'll be young again . Everything there is to fight for began with you . You 're the stone center . You 're Silas . Yeah . And nothing can take the future from this family . Nothing . Least of all David shepherd . Let him go , Silas . I will find David . I will hunt him down . And when his dead body lays at my feet , I 'll come for you for your part in this . Killing David will not keep you king . At least god will know I 'm angry . He 's gone , Silas . Where you cannot find him . His family 's safe too . Nothing can stop god 's plan . I travel that path no more . I 'm a sinner now . He wants peace . I want war . God and I are now constant enemies . Then I bring a message from the enemy . Do not search too hard for my servant , For the day you lay a hand on him ... Will be the day that you die . Oh , is that what he says ? Well , take a message back to him- - " We are at war . "

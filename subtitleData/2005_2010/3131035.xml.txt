 { \ pos ( 200,225 ) } We have a toasted mouse that didn 't get the T4 { \ pos ( 200,225 ) } and a happy mouse that did ! It either works or not . Wanna watch Bob burst into flames ? Get back to work ! - He 's such an asshole , Carlos . - He 's scared , Mayko . David ! You 're not sick because of the cyanobacteria . When you came in you were legally drunk . They found Sertraline and Escitalopram in your system . Just take me home . Why won 't you just say " goodbye dad " ? Why do you make it so hard for me to leave ? Dad . Dad ! Go in there and let them tell you what to do . I come out of there , I become this total boring prick , you 'll tell me right ? It 's too late for that . - Good luck . - Thanks . Very nice . Good morning . Good morning . Shit , shit ! What do you make of this ? They think it 's West Nile Virus . It 's tough to diagnose , even tougher to cure . It 's very routine these days . Why are they bothering us ? Just keep reading . Victims , male , females , 30s and 40s . Most people who get sick with West Nile are over 50 . There are exceptions . I 've heard of 35-year olds who come down with it . I was hoping we could divert this crate to San Francisco . Avoid this bullshit . - What 's this ? - A wish list . That 's what you do all day . You 're asking for 147 million ? - Yeah . - 2 million for an electron microscope . Are you sleeping with somebody I don 't know about ? I ran it all past Herb Kinsman when you were out . Didn 't even blink . Then why is he pulling us down to Washington ? Because the White House has put together this blue ribbon advisory board and he would like to showcase us . So I would like you to focus on being a nice , genial guy . I am so good at that . Answer some basic questions like " What have you done for us lately ? " I think Utah would be a good talking point . If I 'm still awake . Would you like 147 million dollars or not ? Wake me when I 'm on . ReGenesis 3x03 Strangers in the Night Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Goufrach , Lovechange , NikoMagnus Version OGM 1.0 Oh Lord , okay . - The first stop ? - Where do we hide ? Bar . - We 've never met . I 'm Mayko Tran . - Pleased to meet you . - Oh my God . - What ? Be right back . How are you ? - How are you doing ? - Fine , thank you . Surprised to see you here . I 'm the new science czar . - Really ? - Really . So I would just ... love to hear how you landed that one . It was an opportunity I couldn 't refuse . - An opportunity to what ? - Don 't flatter yourself . { \ pos ( 250,260 ) } We 're in Washington . It 's all about maintaining { \ pos ( 250,260 ) } the perception of civility , right ? I had a really nice visit with Jeff . { \ pos ( 150,260 ) } Did you get that letter from my lawyer ? I did . I have to tell you that I was really hoping that we could discuss Jeff 's custody without a lawyer . Can 't the 3 of us sit down and work this out ? Personally , I would prefer an outside opinion . - So you never answered my question . - Which was what ? How did you get this appointment without knowing one damn thing about science ? Well , I slept with you for 25 years . I suppose something rubbed off . { \ pos ( 250,260 ) } The optic nerve damage was extensive . { \ pos ( 250,260 ) } But the surgical team at Sinai treated it aggressively . I was told if the impact had just been 2 millimetres closer to the macula , I would have been permanently blinded . So are we having a good time ? It 's more fun than a roadside colonoscopy . I got another reply from San Francisco . They think it 's 2 outbreaks : West Nile and something else . Mr. Riddlemeyer , Weston Field , NorBAC . Good to see you , Weston . I was looking over your brief this morning . - It was thorough , tight . I appreciate . - Thank you . I 'm a little bit surprised by all the changes at the top though , sir . Carl . Hm ? That 's how it goes with this administration . It 's results-oriented . Without the appropriate outcomes , they 're not afraid to act decisively . Let me introduce you to NorBAC . It 's not necessary . Carlos Serrano . Carl Riddlemeyer . Mucho gusto en conocerlo . Es muy buenas cosas de usted . Pues se va a desilusionar . De ninguna manera . David Sandström . Your reputation precedes you . Who are you ? - This is Carlton Riddlemeyer . - It 's Carl . - Let 's get you a drink . - No thanks . I 'm on the wagon . 3 weeks . I 've been there . Good luck . So what 's the game here , Carl ? It 's all about sharpening the tip of the spear , Dave . Reevaluate . Rejuvenate . - Cut the fat , you know . So we ... - It 's just ... - What ? - Is this David Sandström ? - Yeah , who 's this ? - Angelica Starov . I 'd like to talk to you about Owen . You know what . Hang on a second . I gotta take this . A good friend of mine 's in the slammer . You 're a Republican , I 'm sure you understand . Okay , yeah , what , Owen ? Go ahead . He 's been getting in fights . He stabbed another inmate . Okay , um ... And I believe he 's back on drugs . Fuck . Look , I wanna talk to you about this . I really do but I can 't right now . Can I call you back ? - When ? - Tomorrow . Tomorrow night ... ish . Maybe I should just go back to Toronto . So , Rachel , you 're just full of surprises . - I 'm as surprised as anybody . - Where 'd he come from ? Money and power . He 's a lobbyist . He reps everything from Tobacco to Big Pharma - anyone who needs a shot of perfume . - Okay ... Charming , manipulative , brutal . Usually all 3 at once . And you 're married to him ? - I 'm divorcing him . - Great . What can we expect from him tomorrow ? We 'll be catching a falling knife . - 2 more hospitalizations . - In San Francisco ? We could be doing the science instead of just talking about it . Last week , the President called me into the Oval Office and asked me to help . My first challenge is to cut 3.8 billion dollars out of the science budget . No one likes this . He 's put me in a very difficult situation so I have asked these distinguished gentlemen to recommend some major institutional cuts . Now , I 'm of the opinion that too many individual cuts weakens the whole . Sometimes amputation is in order . I 've been advised to take a good hard look at NorBAC . - Are you familiar with NorBAC ? - Somewhat . Enough to see that there are a number of structural issues . The lab is abroad , run by a Canadian . We have to share decisions with both Mexico and Canada . Now , I understand that this is an enormous decision . And I like to believe that ... I am open to dialogue . I want to give you people a chance to state your case . I assure you , my mind is open . - Doctor Sandström . - Would you allow me to begin ? NorBAC is a watchdog in the world of genetic science . - But what do you actually do ? - We do what nobody else does . We 're a biomedical SWAT team . We have expertise in bioweaponry , disease outbreaks , climate threats ... We 've all read the brochure . Let 's talk specifics . What have you done for me lately ? Oh , I don 't know , uh ... lately ... We saved the planet 's water supply . And you tested the solution on yourself . - What if it went wrong ? - It didn 't . It went really well . The bottom line is , in the science envelope I have centres for disease control , environmental protection , food and drug , NIH . And then there is homeland security , customs and borders , FBI , CIA , NSA , FEMA . They all now do science preparedness and response . So why the heck do I need NorBAC ? This is by far the finest lab I 've ever been associated with . As I understand it , Ms. Woods you 've been in academia for the last 10 years . We have scientists from 3 countries . Viruses know no borders , neither do we . That gives us a special place in U.S. science . We pay 80 % of the tab . Why should the American taxpayer support a lab that 's in Toronto , Canada ? And your location allows you to circumvent american law . Work was done at NorBAC to reverse engineer AIDS drugs . Technically we didn 't break any US laws . What about the fact that your chief virologist got sick from a disease that you were trying to solve ? - That was an accident ... - She quit over it didn 't she ? Now what was her name ? Her name was Jill ... Langston . What the hell is going on here ? Excuse me ? After everything we 've done , everything we 've been through , you dragged our asses down here because we have some explaining to do ? This isn 't personal , Dr. Sandström . I 'm sorry if you have a problem with procedure . Well ... I wanna be perfectly clear here , so ... I 'll rephrase the question . You don 't know what the fuck you 're talking about ... And your distinguished advisors clearly don 't have a fucking clue about what we do at NorBAC . But we have to sit here pissing in our pants while you decide our future ? We 're simply following a directive from the President of the United States . Yeah ? Fuck that shit and fuck you . This is a goddamn ambush . We 're done here . - Perhaps you 'd like to sit down . - You know ... every day your government spends in Iraq could fund NorBAC for a decade . If your President wants to hack away at his budget , - tell him to look at the Pentagon . - The subject is science , not politics . Science ? Science is on the verge of unlocking the secrets of life . There are genetics programs out there underway right now , that make the Manhattan Project look like a bunch of fucking babies playing with lego blocks , and you 're thinking about amputating the only organization that 's actually minding the goddamn store . You 're insane ! All of you ! FEMA ! Jesus Christ ! Thank you , Dr. Sandström . Thank you for your time . - Where is he ? - Relax , Wes . He screwed us in there ! We have operating funds for 4 maybe 5 months then the lab is finished . What was he supposed to do ? It was an inquisition . Beautifully orchestrated by Riddlemeyer . There he is . Let 's get out of here . - Who in the hell do you think you are ? - What ? You cannot tell the US government to go fuck themselves ! They let us play in their sandbox ; you went and shit in it . And I have all the confidence in the world , that you 'll find how to clean it up . Right now , we 've got work to do . Carlos and I are going to San Francisco . They don 't know which way is up . The rest of you back to TO . They 're sending samples . In or out , Wes ? Shit . - Doctor Sandström ? - David . This is Carlos Serrano . - Carlos . - Nice to meet you . - Good flight ? - Next time we take donkeys . Where are we at ? We have 27 critically ill , 4 mortalities , caused by necrotizing pneumonia . They are spread out over 7 hospitals in the bay area . - Victims ? - Adults , equally male and female . - No recoveries ? - None yet . - We understand you have some anomalies . - Why we called you . Test results are all contradictory . We have 4 hospitals saying it 's West Nile and 3 saying it isn 't . And that 's because ... Well , West Nile is spread by mosquitoes . Generally , we 'd see 30 to 50 mild cases in an infected area for each hospitalization . - You 're not finding that here ? - No . Okay . So you 've got a West Nile-like virus that 's not being spread by mosquitoes . Human contact . But none of the victims knew each other . Other than the 2 couples . So how is it spreading ? David would like for you to text him your results . Tell him the IgM-antibody capture ELISA test came up positive for WNV . We 're also doing a real-time PCR on the CSF . - CSF ? - Cerebrospinal fluid . - And an IgG ELISA . - You just said that . That was an IgM . But they show a lot of false positives , so we 're doing a couple of extra serum tests : an IgG and an IgA ELISA . - How about you do that ? - Yeah . West Nile 2004 in the bay area . Lot of dots . 2005 . 2006 . West Nile is increasing 20 % a year in the Bay Area . Climate change ? Probably . Let 's take a look . Fever , headache , stiff neck , convulsions , pneumonia , coma . Textbook West Nile . Treatment ? Intravenous and pulmonary assist . What 's the CDC saying ? They 'll have PRNT results in 4 days . Are any of these patients healthy enough to talk ? She 's the only one who 's making any sense . My name is Doctor Carlos Serrano . Do you remember being bitten by a mosquito ? Have you travelled or been on an airplane in the last 10 days ? No . Have you been with anyone who 's sick in the last 10 days ? I work at the information desk at a library . Strangers all day long . Nina , do you have any idea how you caught this illness ? God has a plan . Everything happens for a reason . Are you a man of faith ? Yes . People are dying , aren 't they ? Don 't worry , Nina . You have the best care in the world here . God bless . God bless . There you are . Video hook-up with David in the conference room . - Great . Thanks . - Okay . Rachel , Wes says the 2 tests came up contradictory . That 's putting it mildly . They got the same thing here . The CDC is doing PRNT , we need to kick some ass . - I 'll run a PCR . - Good . Here 's the problem with the West Nile diagnosis . I 'm not buying that all 4 of these people got bitten by mosquitoes . It 's possible . No , there 'd at least be a mosquito bite , somewhere it scratch . Are there no cases of West Nil passing from human to human ? One case of mother-to-fetus and ... one case of an infant getting it from breast milk . There . That 's why it 's gotta be another kind of virus . People don 't know each other . The transmission has to be , food , place , or air system . That narrows it down to couple thousand types of virus or bacteria . Rachel , you just keep trying to identify it . Bob , look for a chemical or environmental explanation . Carlos will work the cure . He 'll liaise with the CDC and other hospitals . - I know that 's not a real word , Bob . - Interface . Mayko , see if these people are more connected than we think . Okay , maybe they all went to the opera , ate at the same restaurant , had the same flu shot . You know the routine . Happy hunting . We need full medical records on several patients ... I 've got social security numbers here . Patient one is Dennis Harper , social security number 482-623 . That 's not what I wanted . Anything ? Patient 23 has high levels of nickel , cadmium , and palladium . - I don 't think it 's anything , Rachel . - I think you 're right . What ? Okay ... So , of 31 people , 2 went to the same catholic high school in Cleveland at the same time , but didn 't know each other . And that 's about the most exciting thing I 've found so far . You ? Nothing . I do have some more PCR data coming in I could use a hand with . Yeah , no problem . - Coffee ? - Yeah , love some . So can I ask you a personal question ? Let me guess . You and Carl Riddlemeyer ? I cannot get the 2 of you together in my head . I 'm sorry , how did that happen ? Well I 'm a freshman at Brown . It 's the 70s . And ... I read an op-ed in a student paper : Fighting for peace ? Fucking for chastity . Get out now . That 's the guy I fell for . - And that was Carlton ? - Yeah , that 's right . Walked away from a family fortune to change the world . - Pretty sexy . - Serious dough ? Carlton Riddlemeyer the 4th . Shock and awe ... For all the right reasons . Okay , so then what happened to this fairy tale ? Oh , reasons change . We go to Georgetown so he can get a degree in environmental law . I get pregnant . We run out of money . - That 's when family reels him back in . - What do you mean ? He slowly became everything he hated . One molecule at a time . How long were you 2 married ? 147 years . Why 'd you stay so long ? I 've stopped asking myself that question because I hate the answer . Yes , we 're trying to get different drugs in play at different hospitals . We 'd like St. Joseph 's to try ribavirin and acyclovir . That 's fantastic . Okay , thank you . I have been through every obscure disease website , I can find ... Nothing . They lost another patient . - 7 more were admitted . - 7 ? Any connection to the others ? How is it spreading ? How old are the new victims ? 30s and 40s . Where are the young people ? Where are the old ? Morning . PCR results came back , confirming the obvious . It 's not West Nile . Alright , now we know what it isn 't . What the heck is it ? I 'm not here . - What ? - It 's me . - Tell me you know what it is . - Unidentified . Well , call the CDC and let ' em know what you got . Sure , but here 's why I called . 3 of the sick people , either they or their spouse paid for a night at the same motel , on the same night . - Are you awake ? - No . Where 's the motel ? - San Francisco . - No Mayko , they 're from San Francisco . Why would they stay at a motel in San Francisco I don 't know . Ask them . Okay , what are the patient numbers ? 3 ... 13 , and 15 . Okay , good work , Mayko . Dead . Dead . ICU . - Nothing to do with us . - They all stayed here , Miss Gryce . I phoned 2 customers who stayed on that same floor the night before and 2 the night after . Nobody 's sick . These people had rooms on the same floor ? Yeah . Can we see a list of the guests that stayed here that night , on that floor ? Mr. and Mrs. Dean Martin , Mr. and Mrs. Sammy Davis Jr , Peter Lawford ? It 's a motel , Sir . Fine . Do you recognize any of these people ? Right . I call Public Health . They find one cockroach turd , I close you down for a year . He stayed here with his wife . They 're married . Why did they need an alias ? What about this woman ? Did she stay here ? Same night ? Same floor ? Yes . Okay , what 's going on ? Who are these people ? The floor was rented for a convention . Convention ? What kind of convention ? The Sinatra Appreciation Society of San Francisco . What do they do ? They appreciate . And who 's the head appreciator ? Everything 's done by email . Info @ Sinatra or something like that . All I know is they take the same floor the first saturday in march , june , september and december . And on sundays they go to church . Nina , it 's Doctor Serrano . Thank you for visiting me . I need your help , Nina . Tell me about the Sinatra Appreciation Society ? I knew it would catch up with me . Evil has a long memory . What happened ? I went once . You know about the sin of lust ? I know a lot about it . He invited me to join his group . Now God 's punishing me . Who invited you ? You won 't get a better sleep than with a perfect Dreamcoil 2000 . Roll around , it won 't spill . Try it together . It 's okay . He snores . It 's nice though . Firm . How is it for ... indoor sports ? Well , load it up with all your buddies . She 's built to take it . Now all I need are a bunch of buddies . Know how I can get in touch with Joey , Dino and Sammy D ? Okay , who wants to know ? American Bio ... What is this ? We need to know about the Sinatra swingers club . Our club is a matter of personal choice . Okay ? Why don 't you tell us about your personal choice ? You could be in a lot of trouble , Mr. Braungart . - What are you talking about ? - You might 've made lot of people sick . - No , that 's not true . - People are dead . No . We practice safe sex . Okay ? Some viruses can be passed through saliva , physical contact , coughing ... - Sucking , licking , probing . - Come on , Pete . How many partners do your people have each night ? - I don 't know . - Answer . I don 't know ! One ? 10 ? 20 ? It 's up to them . Well , we need a list of all the people who were at your group grope last month . Look , I ... I really can 't tell you that . It 's anonymous . Life and death , Pete . I don 't know everybody 's real name . Okay ? I swear to God . How long have you been sick ? Maybe you have our mystery illness . No , it 's just a summer cold , that 's all . - How long have you had it ? - I don 't know . Couple of weeks , maybe . If he has it , why isn 't he in the hospital with the others ? What the fuck ? - What ? - David Sandström ? Angelica Starov . Yeah , from the Ontario Juvenile Detention Centre , right ? No . I 'm at U of T. Aren 't you the person who called me about Owen getting in some fights ? He was . He stabbed some kid . - Oh , Jesus . - Who needed 12 stitches . David . Another death . - Oh shit . - One of the nurses is sick too . So it 's communicable . It could be a secondary infection . They 're doing tests . He has 32 out of 38 addictive genes , which is why I believe Owen would be perfect for the kind of research I 'm doing . What ? Research ? But you 're a social worker . No ! I 'm scientist ! Peter Braungart 's blood work . Hematologist can 't be certain , but he thinks the blood profile of interleukins and lymphocytes - are identical to the other patients . - So Braungart 's got the virus . A milder case . Why would it be milder ? He 's on a massive dosage of Interferon . Hep C ? Chronic Granulomatous Disease . What ? It 's a hereditary ... - Hello ? ! - I 'm here . Did you get my number ? You know what ? I 'll call you back . It 's a hereditary disease where the neutrophyl granulocytes can 't destroy ingested pathogens . So , they put you on Interferon To boost your immune system . This is fantastic . We may have stumbled on a treatment . Interferon ? Maybe . - We can test it on mice . - That 'll take some time . People . That 's high stakes . Do you think any of your patients look like they 're gonna recover ? Okay . There 's 2 patients whose lungs have ceased to function . They may not last through the night . I 'm willing to take a risk on one of them if we can get - family to okay it . - Good luck . That was an odd call for you to make . Nothing else is working . You 're not gonna start reading to me from that thing are you ? There 's nothing wrong with the Bible , David . I didn 't say there was . I just think it should come with a disclaimer . This is a work of fiction . No , it isn 't . It 's the divine word of God ? I didn 't say that . But it 's not fiction . It 's a book of myths . What 's the difference ? A single person writes fiction . It takes an entire civilization to write a myth . She ... She didn 't make it . She didn 't even last an hour . It might have been the disease . We don 't know . - What ? - Miss me ? Where the hell are ya ? - I 'm not telling . - I can 't believe I 'm talking to you . Come home ! I miss you guys . Where are you ? What are you doing ? Somewhere . Teaching , English and science . I had a few days off , so I hit a beach with a friend . - A friend , - She 's a nun . - I swear . - Bullshit . A Buddhist nun ! So , Bob , Mayko , they 're okay ? We just , we miss you like crazy . When are you coming back ? I need more time . So I check my email , for the first time in 2 months and there are , like 70 from Owen . Man . I thought you were calling to talk about me . You can wait . I don 't think he can . Seriously , he sounds depressed . He 's got some science thing he wants you to check into . What ? Well , have you been checking in with him , like you promised ? I haven 't seen him in , like ... a couple of months . I know . It 's been crazy for you , David . I know , I know . Go see him ? I will ! I was going to . When are you coming back ? I still have a lot I need to figure out about my life . I think I was hiding behind that big mountain of work . Work for me . I miss you . I want you . I want you back here . I better get off the phone before you talk me into getting on a plane . I will see you sometime , David . Wait , wait . Just ... Look , tell me where you are and I 'll come and visit you . Love to Bob and Mayko and Carlos . Even Wes . What about me ? You too . So we are now at 7 dead , 36 hospitalizations . The 4 spouses who were in quarantine have now been admitted . Fuck . Mayko , where are we at with the victimology ? All I could get from the Sinatra website were member emails . Most were anonymous addresses . But I emailed them and explained the situation , told them they 're the only ones who know who else might have contracted this . Did you tell them to report to a hospital ? 'Course , but I don 't know if they went . Rachel ? Well , we 've cloned and sequenced 32 viruses common to patients 3 , 17 , and 19 , and still can 't find the one that explains Sinatra . - That 's what we 're calling it . - Nice . How many do you have left ? - Hundreds . - Hurry it up . Well , Rachel and I coo .. The viruses that we have eliminated are the most likely candidates . So the work we 've done is actually significant . Is it ? Well , then , I 'll be patient for the next ... Time 's up . Anything else ? One medical worker became infected , but it looks like she has strep . We 're back to believing that it 's only passed through very intimate contact . That 's the good news . - Bad news ? - Well , there are still no recoveries . Okay , here 's what I don 't understand , Pete Braungart is on Interferon , right ? That 's why he 's alive . The Interferon gives him the extra immunity that he needs to live . So we give this Interferon , we give this extra immunity to Nina and she dies . It doesn 't make any sense . We 're still missing a big piece of the puzzle . Pete has Chronic Granulomatous , right ? It 's a disorder of the phagocytic cells . It 's a strange disease . Only 1000 Americans have it , 86 % male . And it 's rare to live to be an adult . They think it 's associated with 4 genes . CYB-B , CYB-A , NCF-1 and NCF-2 . Maybe those genes are the key . That 's good , Bob . Work that up , okay . Have a good day . How you doin ' ? So , what 's the drug of choice in here ? Crystal ? - No . - No ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Sometimes . Not much . - Think that 's a good idea ? - You try being in here . Have a seat . I hear you 've been getting in some fights . Knifed a guy . That 's VD . Got a venereal disease too ? No . Violent and Dangerous . That 's what they call this place . Well , that 's still no excuse for the stabbing . Come on you 're a smart guy . You know how to talk yourself out of a tight spot . 2 guys tried to rape me , alright ? Now my lawyer says my case is fucked because of the fight for protecting myself . So I 'm looking at even longer in here . I 'll uh ... - I 'll talk to your lawyer . - Fuck that noise . I 'm gonna do this thing with Angie . Who ? Angie . Scientist . Russian . Smokin ' hot . I spoke to somebody about you . Is that who I was talking to ? Are you fucking retarded ? Yes ! She 's doing this thing about knocking out addiction . - She 's gonna do it on me . - Wait a minute . What are you talking about ? I don 't know . She fixes addicts by messing with the biology in their brains . The science is way off . But that 's what you said had to happen . I was talking about your genes . She just does it with your brain . How ? - I don 't know . She does it on mice ! - That 's mice , Owen ! She 's going to do it on me . - No , it 's ridiculous . - She 's going to do it . It sounds like your mind is all made up . So what am I here for ? You want my permission ? I 'm not your old man . You want me to tell you it 's all gonna be okay . Is that it ? Well , I 'm not gonna do that , cuz it 's not gonna be okay ! Forget it , Owen . Look , my lawyer says that if I volunteer to be a test subject then I got a shot at getting outta here . Look , I cannot stay in here , David ! Just call her . David . Really bad time right now Wes . - It 's gonna get a lot worse . - What ? We just got a priority alert of an outbreak in Boston . 13 thirty-somethings , male and female , in critical condition , one fatality . Symptoms ? Fever , headache , sore neck , convulsions , coma , pneumonia . - Sinatra ? - Looks that way . Fuck . Okay , Carlos and I on the next flight . Get Mayko in the loop with Richard Shrider . Tell him we need to figure out if any friends , relatives , or colleagues of the patients in San Francisco travelled to Boston . I 'm on it . Guys ! This little virus is already starting to jump cities and we still don 't know what the fuck it is ! We 're losing ! We 're losing . { \ pos ( 200,225 ) } I asked you to help me . { \ pos ( 200,225 ) } You told me that my addiction could be fixed . Owen ! What I told you was we might be able to turn off the addiction genes in you but the science is like , 15 years from now . Angelica can do it now . I 'll talk to her . Isn 't appetite related to the same neurological pathway as addiction ? Fever , headache , stiffness , convulsions , pneumonia , coma . Wes , the Boston patients are all parents of infants . The outbreak seems to be centered around a place in a mall where kids play . Where are you Sinatra ? We 've got the beginnings of a pandemic here and we don 't have a clue .

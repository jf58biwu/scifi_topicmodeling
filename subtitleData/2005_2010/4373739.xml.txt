How 's my girl ? Daddy ! Hey , boys , come here . Anything interesting happened while we were gone ? Nope , everything was ... unbelievably ordinary . Wait 'll you see what I got you guys . What do you think it is ? Paris is cold this time of year , so here 's a nice warm coat . Brown Wool , It 's not flashy , but it 's fashionable . Now let 's talk about gloves . I 'll let you two say good-bye . You can 't leave . I have to . At least until the election 's over . I found you in Odessa . We save each other , you end up being my niece . This isn 't just random , okay , this is destiny . My father sacrificed himself so that I could have a life , not a destiny . You can 't save me , Peter ... not this time . And Nathan can ? Nathan can keep me safe . Safe ? ! You can 't get hurt ! You 're here to save the world . How ? ! I 'm sorry , I can 't go around chasing some fantasy . It 's not some fantasy , okay ? I explode . I see it . I wipe out this whole city . You , Nathan , everyone . You explode ? Yeah . Like a nuclear bomb . Nuclear ? Like Ted . Ted ? Who the hell is Ted ? - I told you no phone calls . - It 's my wife . If we 're going on a suicide mission , I 'd like to call her and tell her I love her , say good-bye . You think I don 't want to talk to my wife ? That I don 't miss my son and my daughter ? We 're doing this to protect the people we love . The company has a new tracking system . Now , this Walker System doesn 't rely on Isotopes and Satellites . It just finds you wherever you are . So we 've gotta play this smart . Switch cars , stay to the back roads . Fine , we go to New York , we wipe out the Walker System . Exactly . Ted . Yeah , almost done . Let 's go .. That man . the glowing hands . He 's the exploding man . I 'm going to take his power . I 'm going to explode ? Is this my future ? Is that what you saw , Isaac ? Hello ? Mohinder , I need your help . Sylar ? I think I 'm gonna do something bad . You 're a murderer . You don 't get the luxury of regret . You don 't understand . I think I 'm gonna kill a lot more people . A lot more ... I understood it before ... the killing . I had a reason . To take what others didn 't deserve . It was natural selection . What are you talking about ? An Apocalypse . A Massacre . Half the city gone in an instant . They mean nothing . They 're innocent . There 's no gain , so why would I do it ? What possible reason could I have for killing so many ? Wait , listen . You don 't have to . If you 're truly repentant about what you 've done , ... turn yourself in . I can hear you dialing 911 . It was a mistake to call . No , wait , Sylar ... Sylar ! Where 's Micah ? A car from the Corinthian Casino picked him up . That 's Linderman 's casino . What aren 't you telling me ? Linderman said that , he needed Micah for a job . A job ? ! He 's ten years old , and you let him go ? ! Of course not . I told him no . - What have you done ? - Me ? It was Linderman . No , this is your fault ! Your responsibility . I 'm done with you . I 'll get Micah my damn self . Don 't let him go . You 're the one that can save Micah . He 's gonna get killed if he goes alone . Please . Wait . Two-pointer for Vladimir Radmanovic . Everything 's under control , Mr. Linderman . He 's a good kid . Not that I mind the babysitting , but don 't you think this is a waste of my talent ? Thanks . No , I appreciate that , I do . I will . Who was on the phone ? It was Mr. Linderman . He wanted to make sure that you were ready for tomorrow . Isn 't that nice ? Mom , I don 't like Mr. Linderman . Well , why not ? I don 't know , He smells funny . Mom , I don 't like it here . I don 't want to do this . Micah ... I want to go home . Mr. Linderman helped us , and now we have to help him . That 's the last that I want to talk about it , okay ? But , Mom , I just don 't ... Micah , that 's enough . Hey ... You know that I would never let anything bad happen to you , right ? Give me a smile . Okay . It 's good to see you again , Professor . So , have you thought about my offer ? Are you ready to come to work for us ? As far as I can tell , you 're all a bunch of untrustworthy Gundas . Is that a NO ? No , I 'm not going to work for you ... you 're going to work for me . You 're going to show me everything you do , everything you know , and I 'm going to use it to help me stop Sylar . And why would I do that ? You raided my father 's office in Chennai , planted Eden as my next door neighbor . You want what I have ... the formula . I can find more of them . You 're the one who needs me . Some people died because you led Sylar right to them . And now you blame yourself , so you become a vigilante . Hmm , that 's cute . Is that a " NO " ? What choice do I have ? Come on in . What is this place ? There 's someone you need to meet . Molly Walker . Does the name ring any bells ? Yeah , she was on my father 's list . That 's right . Your father led Sylar right to her . He slaughtered her parents , then attacked her . How did she survive ? Well , luckily , we got to her . That 's what we do . We find people with abilities , help them , protect them . And she 's sick , isn 't she ? How can you tell ? Her nucleotides are decomposing . You need to get her to a doctor . A doctor can 't help her . I 'm thinking maybe you can . I 'm a geneticist . I wouldn 't know the first thing about this . Molly 's virus is very rare . It 's destroying her nervous system . Prevents her from accessing her ability . There 's been one other case . An Indian girl , 1974 . My sister . Shanti died . Yes , we know . Sadly , your father developed a cure months too late . Unfortunately for Molly , our people can 't figure out what that cure is . Cute , huh ? You 're trying to manipulate me ? Showing me this poor girl , preying on Shanti 's memory . Sylar is out there , and he 's planning a slaughter . Everyone is in danger , and this ... none of this is going to help . You just don 't get it . Molly is the only one who can stop Sylar . It 's me . I know it 's been a while , but I 've been thinking about things . Thinking about the future- - my future . I know it 's last minute , but if I could just come talk to you . Can I come over ? Great . I 'll see you soon . I can hear you . Whoever you are ... come on out . You do that again , I will kill you . You 're lucky I didn 't leave your ass stuck in the wall after what you 've done . What the hell is this place ? It 's where Linderman restores his art . He usually hangs out in here . What 's that ? Is that supposed to be ... Micah ? Where is he ? I don 't know , New York , maybe ? Her fourth grade report card . Niki 's immunization records . School photos and medical files . He 's tracked our entire life . This finally makes sense . No . No , this is crazy . Nobody does what you and I can do ... what Micah can do ... Nobody . My life . Me and Niki , everything we had , it was ... it wasn 't real . It was all Linderman 's science experiment . All this time Linderman 's just been playing with our lives . What are you doing ? Linderman obviously isn 't here . We 're wasting our time . If Linderman knows this much about us , he must know something about Micah . Where he went , what he 's doing . Linderman went to New York . Some note about Petrelli on election day . We find Linderman , we find Micah . Let 's get Micah the hell out of there . Hi , Molly . I 'm Dr. Suresh , and I need to take some blood , if that 's okay . Molly , I want to stop the man who hurt your family , and who tried to hurt you . You can 't stop the Boogeyman . He sees into your soul , and then he eats your brain . Well , you know who can stop the boogeyman ? You . I hear you have an amazing ability . It 's not so amazing . They ask me where people are , and I find them . You find them ? Anywhere in the world ? Yeah , I just think about them , and then I know where they are . But it doesn 't work right now . Well , that is a very special ability , Molly . Because the boogeyman , he likes to hide . But if you can tell us where he is , we can make sure he never comes back again . You 're different from the other doctors . You 're much better at this . Thanks . You 're telling me , this guy Ted Sprague blew up your house ? Yeah , pretty much . Don 't you see this , Nathan ? Maybe I 'm not the bomb . Maybe this guy Ted Sprague is . Maybe we can stop him . You said you had a dream that you blew up New York City . Yeah , I also dreamed that I could fly . We know how that turned out for you . You can fly ? That 's cool . The election is tomorrow . Pick up the phone , call the FBI . We need to find him . Nathan ... trust me . I 'll make a few calls . Claire . You 've been through a lot . You 're very brave . I just want you to know that I admire that . Mr. Linderman , we have a problem . Oh , thank you , Lord , for bringing my Gabriel home safe . Hi , Mom . Huh ? Thank you , Lord . Oh ... Come in , come in . If I 'd known you were coming , I would have straightened up more . Um , I brought it from Texas . It 's ... For your collection . perfect ! One more , and I have the continent . I 'm just missing Oregon . I hear it 's beautiful there . Green everywhere . The clock 's broken . Oh , that old thing , I should have thrown it away years ago . It was Dad 's . It 's junk . It 's a beautiful piece . It just needs a little attention . I can tell you how proud I am . I haven 't done anything . You 've traveled the world . Some of us only get to see it in snow globes . I 'm tired of traveling , I think I might stay here . In Queens ? Why would you ever come back ? If I stayed , maybe I could stop . Maybe I wouldn 't have to ... What ? Gabriel . I 'm gonna make you a sandwich . You want tuna fish ? Please don 't , I 'm not hungry . Well ... if you insist on staying ... You should call Mr. Bilger ... that man from Smith Barney . You fixed his Rolex . Why would I call him ? Because he said you should . He said you were very talented , and very special . Maybe he could get you a job . I have a job . I fix watches . That 's a hobby . Investment banking is a very lucrative field . I can 't be an investment banker . You could be anything you want . Mom , he wouldn 't even remember who I am . Who could forget you ? You 're not even listening to me ! I am listening . No . You 're making a tuna sandwich . So ? I asked you not to . I made a mistake . I 'm sorry ! Mom ... Mom , don 't . Don 't , it 's just ... maybe I don 't have to be special . That 's okay to just be a normal watch-maker . Can 't you just tell me that 's enough ? Why would I tell you that when I know you could be so much more ? If you wanted , you could be president . What are we doing here ? Shouldn 't we be looking for Ted ? The FBI and police aren 't going to believe us . They 'll take Nathan seriously , though . He can evacuate the people . Wait . What ? What , what , what ... . what is it ? That man . That 's the man my father works for . He 's the one I 've been running from . Whoa , whoa , whoa , wait a minute . We don 't know what 's happening in there . Linderman doesn 't have a grasp on the situation , Thompson . And why would you think that ? All the pundits think I 'm gonna lose . And this morning my brother tells me about a fella named Ted Sprague--ring a bell ? We know all about Sprague . I don 't appreciate being kept in the dark . Especially not today . Oh , God , I can 't believe I 've been so stupid . My father took a bullet to keep me from that man , and now he 's with Nathan . It can 't be what you think . Why do you keep running back to him ? 'Cause he 's my brother . The truth is , you have no idea what 's gonna happen . You 're nervous . Nervous ? You want to blow up half of New York . Yes , we do . - You 're scared . - Yeah , I am . I 'm terrified . I have to find a nuclear man , and I don 't know if I can contain all that power . Then run the other way . - I can 't . - Why not ? Because if we save ourselves , who 's gonna save everyone else ? Why are you asking me to make this sacrifice ? For the best of reasons . You 're not alone , Claire . All right ? You coming ? No ... this is crazy . I 'm getting out of here . Micah , I 'm gonna go hop in the shower . You gonna be okay ? Mm-hmm . Hey , Mom , I 'm sorry that I talked back to you earlier . I know that you just want what 's best . Thanks . Uh-oh . Now I got ya . Put ' em up or I 'll blow you to bits ! Okay , you asked for it . Take that . Uh-oh . Uh-oh . Who are you ? How 'd you do that ? I can make you see anything I want . Makes it kind of hard to get away , huh ? Now I got ya ... Where 's my mom ? Look , I don 't want to hurt you . I like you . But if you don 't listen to what Mr. Linderman says , well , I 'll show you things that 'll seriously mess you up for life . So you need to behave . Okay ? What if I told you that I can be special ? Important . But to do it , I 'd have to hurt a lot of people . Should I ? You ? ! You can never hurt anyone . There 's a lot of things that I can do that you don 't know about . I have something to show you . What are you doing ? ! I know how much you love snow globes . How ... how did you ... Gabriel ? Gabriel ? I 'm sorry , Molly . I didn 't mean to frighten you . You can 't help me either . It 's okay . No , actually , my father did find a cure . It 's called an Antibody . Unfortunately , we don 't know where or what it is . It 's hiding , like the Boogeyman . Exactly . Who 's that ? It 's my sister Shanti . She 's very pretty . This is the first time I 've ever seen her . She died before I was born . Am I going to die ? Molly , my father did everything he could to save my sister . He was just a few months too late . I won 't be , I promise . Oh ... What 's this ? It 'll protect you from the Boogeyman . Thank you . Please . I 'm sorry I scared you , just come out and talk to me . Please . Mom ? I saw a vision of the future ... and I 'm gonna kill a lot of people . Tell me why I would do that . Mom ? I 'm leaving . And when I get back , I expect you to be gone . Don 't say that , Mom . - It 's me ... it 's Gabriel . - You 're not Gabriel . You 're damned , and I want you out of my house . Mom ... Let go ! Get away from me ! Mom , calm down . - Get away ! - Calm down . I want my son . What did you do with my son ? Give me back my boy . Mom , please , it 's me . It 's me , Mom , please ... No . My Gabriel ... - Mom , stop it , stop it ! - You 're not ... you 're not ! - Stop , stop . - You 're not , you 're not ! You 're not ... I 'm sorry . Hyah ! That heartbeat ... You were in the loft . Why are you following me ? I must stop you . Then do it . Do it ! Kill me ! You can 't , you coward . Now I 'm gonna have to kill you . No ! Hiro ! You did it . You found the cure . Where was it ? It was in me . Sometimes ... when a mommy and daddy have a sick child , they have another baby . A healthy baby with healthy antibodies . And if we 're very lucky , the healthy baby 's blood will heal the sick baby . Unfortunately , I was born a little too late to help my sister . But I 'm not too late to help you . You weren 't even going to say good-bye ? Good-bye . I think I figured a way for you to save the world . A gun ? That 's how I save the world- - that 's your plan ? I can handle Ted . But if I lose it , you 're the only one who can get close enough to stop me . Right through the back of the head . You know the spot . Same place you pulled the piece of glass from . My destiny is not to shoot you . The universe cannot be that lame . You cannot run away from who you are , Claire . This bomb is happening . How can you be so sure ? Because I can draw the future . I met a guy who can do it , now I can do it , you see ? Someone 's gonna blow . Me , Ted ... It doesn 't really matter . It 's happening around the election , unless you stop it . That 's Ted . You drew Ted . Are you sure ? I 'll never forget that face . That 's Kirby Plaza , Midtown . Ted is here in New York . Don 't you see , Claire ? You 're part of this . But you have to do this . Thank you , Benjamin . What are you doing here ? I didn 't think I 'd see you till later tonight . A mother can 't be worried about her son on the most important day of his life ? I was just working on the speech ... some details of the concession . I 'm not talking about the election . Linderman called me . He said you 're getting cold feet . It 's natural to feel ambivalent . Nobody expects you to feel otherwise . So I wanted to give you perspective . You know about Linderman 's plans ? Yes . Well , they 're not just Linderman 's . A lot of people put time and care into making this a reality . Myself included . You ? Yes , you don 't know everything about me , Nathan . But I do know everything about you . And I know what you 're capable of . Do you think I 'm a mass murderer ? Important men make impossible decisions . President Truman dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II . Killed thousands to save millions . That was different , Ma , we were at war . I can 't accept this . That is your one weakness , Nathan ... you have no faith . So how could you possibly believe this bomb could actually heal the world if you have no faith in the idea of destiny ? Your destiny , Nathan , is to set the course of history after this unspeakable act has occurred . The people will look back on what you do as the freshman congressman from New York , and they will thank you . For your strength , for your conviction , for your faith . In my day , we called it Being Presidential . Can you believe ? Can you be the one we need ? That 's my boy ... You were right , Mom . I am meant to be special , just like you wanted . I can be anything . I can even be President . There 's no sign of him . What 's wrong ? I 'm not normal . I tried to pretend that I was , and I just ... hurt everyone . My mom , my dad . I ruined everything because of what I am . I hated it . But you ... When I met you , I finally felt like I was a part of something . That 's funny . I felt the same thing when I met you . Dad . Dad ! Claire ! I love you , Claire Bear . Claire ? What 's he doing ? He 's absorbing your ability . He 's gotta make it stop . Brought To You By MohammaD [ shock Movies ] To Be Continued ...

 THE LAST DAYS OF THE WORLD WEDNESDAY , JULY 4 Nice day . I 'll go out . Looking for something ? Good day . I 'm looking for ... a notebook , or something to write in , but ... Oh , sorry . There are problems with processing paper . - We 're sold out on notebooks . - All right . There 's a shortage of paper . Just look at the newspapers : Nothing but disaster and catastrophes . I stopped reading newspapers . Good decision . I 've got an idea for you . Here . This is a cookbook , but in between the recipes ... there 's a blank page where the cook ... can make personal notes . Voila ! That 's all I can do for you . Do you fancy cooking ? No . But I can fix some food . It was last year , early in July . Like every summer , I visited my parents for a week , with my wife and daughter . Be careful ! You too , Dad ! The sun is very strong . Don 't be cheeky ! But she 's right . The sun is really intense . Look ! Biarritz is small ! Every night I drank a beer after dinner . The afternoons with my parents bored me ... but my wife enjoyed it . Dad ! Dad ! Want a drink ? No thanks , I 'm going home . Ciao . It would be strange not to be concerned ... about what happened around lately ! May I buy you a coffee ? Of course . Why not ? Sorry if I 'm so curious , but what are you writing ? Does it work ? There isn 't much space . It 's enough . Are you staying in your parents apartment ? I saw the lights on at night . Sorry , you seem to know me well ... I 'm not sure if I 've met you , Mrs ... Ombeline Ribot . - Ombeline Ribot ? I don 't know ... sorry . Ombeline isn 't my real name ... Let me tell you . My father called me so ... twenty years ago , when he sold umbrellas and parasols . Well I talk a lot . You taught geography , right ? Yes , I quit teaching five years ago . To become a writer ? Oh no , I 'm kind of travelling salesman . I work for a Taiwanese company selling baths . Now that 's original . I was very ... affected by the disappearance of your parents last autumn . To die on such a beautiful boat ... Again the incinerators ! This can 't be true ! It seems that 's it . Excuse me , but I have to go . No problem . I 'll try to find paper for you . And if things get worse ... It was a pleasure to meet you . Thanks , I feel the same . Waiter ! The bill . Bye . Bye . Were you early up or didn 't you sleep ? Call me if you like . What do you want to do today ? I 'd love eating fish in Spain . AVENUE DES BASQUES NO.12 ... THIS AFTERNOON ? Damn it . A meeting with the Taiwanese at the baths . - I have to go . - Me too . Hello . See you tomorrow . Excuse me , I 'm going crazy since yesterday . Has anything special happened , so you came here ? - No , no . ? Sit down please . Today it 's a little better . But you are unique . I 'll try to make the consultation as short as possible . I don 't know how to say it , but I feel that ... I have an impression that ... An impression of ... ? I think we ... We 've been three weeks fishing for tuna ... but my problem is I can 't catch the hare . The hare is out of its burrow . Has your wife noticed your obsession with that woman ? Yes ... Well , not really . I started writing my story to her this morning . I was together with Lae until after midnight . I hadn 't seen my family all day . In the evening Lae worked in the " Chambre d 'Amour " . " On the beach behind the lighthouse ? " I asked her . " No , under the lighthouse " , she answered with a laugh . I walked through a deserted Biarritz waiting for her all night . I felt like a street dog . - I 'm hungry . - I bought something . Thank you . You ... sleep with your clients ? No no . I don 't get involved with customers . What means " not involved " ? Let 's go swimming . Yes , come on . And so we lived for ten days , without my wife and daughter . I sailed the seas of adultery with absolute lightness . Like Robinson and Friday on the deserted island . What was the best time in your life ? My childhood especially . And yours ? The present , you . I hoped to find you here ! I 'm glad to see you . So am I. What are you doing here ? The concert got cancelled . You didn 't get my message ? - You know they 're looking for you ? - Really ? Oh shit . Are you relaxing ? Yes , a little . They expect the worst , Dad . What will you do ? - What can I do ? - Will you stay here ? - But what ? - Come on , Dad ! - The virus has spread to Ukraine ... - That 's nothing new . - I 've talked with Mom . - How 's it going for her ? Are they still trying to control the air pollution . They say Biarritz and the Atlantic coast are very dangerous areas . The water 's contaminated according to the ministry . Listen , we have an agreement with a skipper . We meet in Hendaye and go to Bilbao . We 're leaving tonight . We are a four . Everyone can bring someone . Want to join us ? Thank you for caring about me , but sorry , no . - I can 't imagine to go out ... - I know dad , that 's not the problem . Where will you go ? With whom ? I 'm fine here by myself , with my cookbook . - Want to try ? - I 'm not hungry . How 's your hand ? It 's okay , if I treat it carefully . - Good luck . - You too . Waiter ? A whiskey , please . I missed you . So did I. - It 's Djibril ! - Who ? Hello . - Is Lae ready ? - Ready ? - How are you ? - Fine , thank you . Sorry , but it 's a date I couldn 't cancel . Don 't worry . I 'm back soon . Ciao . SEE YOU AT " RESIDENCE MAXIM " SUITE 516 . LAE . Monsieur ! The bill please . Monsieur ! Oh my god ! You 'll see it won 't be only him ! It will happen to everyone ! Shut up ! Robinson . Theo ? I was just thinking of you . This doomsday mood makes people start to party , everyone returns home , families come together . It 's like Christmas ! Does it still rain ashes ? - Did you arrive today ? - Yes , from Paris . I 'm so happy to see you . In fact , I 'm here for a rather funny reason ... you see that blonde girl , at the end of the bar ? Yes . Another one for me and my friend ... Whiskey , no ice . - Do you think she resembles me ? - Well she 's blond , maybe if ... In the late 80s , I gave singing lessons for the Marquise d 'Arcangues . I was 20 , she was twice as old . We had a short affair . But then she didn 't want to see me anymore . Last week , I got a letter from her , where she says that I 'm the father of her daughter . Iris . It 's her . The Marquise has got insane , she believes that her daughter and I can save the world from the apocalypse if we ... make love together ... Sounds scary , huh ? Does she know it ? Well , I don 't know . She jumped on me and called me " Dad " . She said I 'd find her in the " Chambre d 'Amour " this winter . - " Eclipse " , is all she said . - Hello , Robinson ! - Hello . Theo . Theo ? I know him . You are Theo Rosell , the tenor . I love your work ! The finale in " L 'amour sorcier " is fantastic . May I present my husband . Cedric Ribot , the town 's pharmacist . Excuse me , but we can 't stay . We 're going to the Costa Brava to our apartment tonight . An early holiday . Nice to meet you . - Likewise . Bye . - Yes ? - Could you put on some music ? Of course . Well , well I 'm leaving . And you , where will you go ? I 've no hurry . Have you heard from Laetitia ? Nope . I 'll come along . You don 't want to talk to her ? No , tonight I 'm not in parental mood . Lae ? Lae ? Thanks for coming . I 'm exhausted . I don 't want to work anymore . The suite is reserved tonight . - How was your " dinner " ? - Oh , nothing special . I met the producers of an erotic show . My tits are too small . Do you also find it ? No , no . Are you going to leave ? What do you mean ? I just came . Is this a game ? Come on . Let 's go to Paris . Okay . - Great ! - Come on . The next morning , Lae was gone . Without an explanation . Not a note . Nothing . What are you doing here ? I 've been driving all night . I 'm so tired of hotels . Has Melanie left ? Yes , not long ago she went to La Rochelle . Oh sorry , that 's true . - How was Luchon ? - Not bad . Did you enjoy the mountains ? They are awesome . What ? I was neither in Luchon , or Vichy or Aix les Bains . I 'm in love with a younger woman . We met this summer at ... - Biarritz ? - Yes . I spent some nights with her . This morning she was gone . All her things too . I know it 's over . Now you want some advice ? Yes , Pierre ? It 's Chloe . I have to cancel the staff meeting . I can 't come , my husband had an accident . No , not serious . You call me if something goes wrong ? No , I 'll reach it in time . Yes ... see you . Excuse me . I was also with someone . Really ? We broke up a week later . THURSDAY , JULY 5 Basque coast ... Yesterday at 23 : 00 , the Prefect of Bayonne ... ordered the evacuation of the entire Atlantic coast . The Spanish authorities haven 't made a decision yet . Farewell , my country ... Oh my god . Farewell father . Farewell mother ! I don 't know if I ever can come back . I 'll try to meet Melanie . She said there 's a place where it 's safe to go . An island . " Robinson " . It sounds like a fantasy , dad . I 'll tell you . Hey , you idiot ! Fuck you ! Saint Jean Pied de Port ... to Roncevaux ... via Pamplona , and then to Bilbao . Zaragoza Her mother lives in Zaragoza . Anyone here ? Come on . This weekend I 'll go to Normandy to eat cake . Enjoy the benefits of freedom ! How do you say : " One woman lost ... " ? On Monday my seminar in Taiwan starts .

Lae . FRIDAY , JULY 6 No news ? No . We 're looking for other survivors of the earthquake in Spain . Take a banana . Don 't worry , I 'll be back before darkness . What an earthquake ! And we didn 't feel it coming . I think it were underground nuclear explosions ! - Want a drink ? Pastis ? It 's going to be hot . No thanks . I 've got water . Look . Water from Lourdes . Decontaminated . It delivers us from evil energy . The beautiful basilica collapsed ... with all the pilgrims inside . Swap it for your bicycle ? A nuclear bomb was dropped at Moscow . There are an estimated 90,000 deaths . SATURDAY , JULY 7 Where 's the train station ? Through that gate and left . Madame Ribot , Ombeline ... May I help you ? M. Laborde ... Robinson . Yes , yes . Where shall we go ? I don 't know . The train dropped me off here . They closed the station . My husband ... My husband left me . Excuse me . Let 's go somewhere . My God , this city is so strange . What shall we do ? When I returned from the bathroom , only my suitcase stood there ... Can you imagine ? He had just abandoned me , here in Spain ... in all this chaos . My life had changed instantly . I realized that he did exactly what I dreamed of . You know , I actually loved another man . We used to meet secretly on his boat ... and the next morning we went fishing ... I enjoyed to eat fresh fish from the Hendaye bay . We did it for several years . I loved him , until one day he said : " Tonight I can 't come to the port , I have to do something . " He never returned . We stopped meeting . That man was your father . These nights my husband was with an other woman . He said he was at his mother . That was last autumn . I 'm talking too much again ... What about you ? Me ? Are you a good cook ? For me ? May I ? I wrote with my left hand . It 's a story . It 's your story ? We must go . My suitcase ! Bombs have exploded all over the city . They blew up the station . We can 't get out of here ! Tomorrow morning ... We can walk ... Where to ? To Zaragoza . We can go to the station there , and take a train . To go where ? Got a flashlight ? Yes . - I remember it , it 's your father 's knife flashlight . - Yes . Can you read ? Yes . - Does it suit me ? - Very well . We 'll take it off in the bath . - Will we be naked ? - Yes . There 's for women . - Don 't we go together ? - No . Do how I told you . Cuckoo , Robinson ... Cuckoo ! This is so good ! I missed you ! The women were very nice , but no one speaks French ! - Laetitia , you can 't be here . - Why not ? Relax , we 're alone ! Robinson ! The girl I met in the bath , Abi ... has a bar in the center of Taichung . It 's called " Je T 'Aime " , nice huh ? She 's invited us for tonight . I 've booked a table in a traditional restaurant . For a dinner for two . Please close the door when you 're on the toilet . Really , you have no shame ! What 's your problem . I 'd like to be naked always . It tickles ! And it 's hot ! - Want to try ? - It stinks ! I know very well that I don 't stink . Alright , I go to Abi 's bar to tell her we won 't come . See you in the " Bamboo " . " Les Cerisiers " . And Mme. Labolde ? Sake . Sorry , I 'm looking for a nightclub called Je T 'aime . - Turn left over there . - Into that street ? Thank you . - Are you Abi ? - Yes . - I 'm looking for ... a young lady , Laetitia . - Lae ? From Paris ? - Yes ... - She left ! - Alone ? - No , with a man . A man ... A Taiwanese ? No , someone like you ... Eh ... you know . Lae ? It wasn 't her . But the police from Biarritz . Yes , that 's me . Yes . My parents had disappeared . Their boat was found ... but not the bodies . I 'm abroad . Well . Yes , thank you . Lae hadn 't returned to the hotel yet . I left her a message that I had to return to France urgently . SUNDAY , JULY 8 Following a woman doesn 't always lead you to hell ! There it is ! I knew it . The Grand Hotel de Saint Jeroni ! - Have you been here before ? - Yes , coincidently . Oh no ! Again ! Wait here . Bravo . Traditionally , the Grand Hotel Saint Jeroni reserves ... a suite in case the Royal Family comes . Come . I have not a penny left , but we 're still alive . If you knew how lonely I was at the time of my adultery , I felt like a stranded ship . But now we have something common . Tell me how you lost your ... your hand . You 're sure I 'm not the wrong man ? You 're at your father 's age was when first I met him . But you don 't look like him . It 's a sign that we met while everything 's falling apart . Come . Look at that beautiful landscape . Take me outside . I spent all my life hiding ! Yes ... by the rocks . Everything is possible with you . Yes ! With your father I always cried afterwards . I 'm sorry that it happened so quickly for me . It was such a long time ago . No problem . We did it together . - That is what counts . - Yes . Oh my God ! There he is . Who is there ? Cedric , my husband . With the blonde from the " Eclipse " . No , stop it ! Don 't look at them ! The bastard ... What have you done ? - Me ? - Yeah , you . You took me to town and now I meet my husband ... dining with another woman . It 's so embarrassing . Let 's do something ... - Shall we go ? - And then ? And I just follow you ? You don 't care about what I 'm going through ! You are a coward ! Just like your father . I leave . Won 't you talk to your husband now ? He has seen us . Hey dad . I just want to say that everything 's fine . See you . Kiss kiss . Hello Melanie . I 'm in Spain . Everything 's fine as well . The situation here is still fairly quiet . It is evening , I walk around . I 'll stay here a few days ... until the situation gets better . Keep me informed about you trip ... and good luck . I still had the spare key of my husband 's car . Come on enter . It 's better than walking . But don 't try to touch me . In early March I received a phone call , it was her . She was in Canada . We should meet a week later in a hotel near Montreal . She said : " We can ride a snowmobile " I didn 't know what that was . " You 'll see . You 'll love it . Until Saturday , my love . Big hug . " Lae was radiant , as always . She paid it all . I was her guest . I saved my questions for later ... Is that the hat from Taiwan ? Yes . You look good . Let 's run ! I couldn 't think anymore . I just wanted to save my skin . I thought I should die but I arrived at the hotel finally . MONDAY , JULY 9 First I lost my fingers , and then my entire hand . I tried to forget the whole story ... but I just can 't . Her mother lives here . I need to know if Laetitia is dead or alive . I understand . There it is . If I were you , I 'd drive to Costa Brava and wait for your husband . He 'll come sooner or later . You think I can 't handle our great adventure ? You 're wrong . I 'll wait for you , okay ? There . I 'll be back ! Madam ! Madam ! Lae ! Laetitia ! I 'm a friend of Laetitia ! Are you her mother ? Laetitia 's mother ? Mother of Lae ? - Lae 's mother ? - Lae ? Yes . Do you know where she is ? I 'm a friend of Lae . - Robinson . - Lae ? - What ? Since when ? - Since always . - Since always ? - Yes , since always ... Robinson ! Was it her mother ? Yes , but she knew nothing . Put that on ! Free at last . Let 's find the station . I don 't want it . Come on , quick . Welcome to Toulouse-Matabiau . It 's 11 : 50 p.m .. The outside temperature is 38 ° C. We 're save , my dear . I 've studied geography here . I don 't want to hear it . Ladies and gentlemen , please follow the decontamination program ... and queue in line at the train . Thank you . Ladies and gentlemen , I am Captain Husson , ... Commander of the Sanitary Intervention Team . With the huge influx of refugees in the region ... the capacity of residences is saturated . You 'll be brought to a temporary camp to spend the night . Food will be served on arrival . Thanks for your attention . Robinson Laborde ? - Yes . - Follow me . TUESDAY , JULY 10 Madam ? - Yes , that 's him . - What are you doing here ? All ministries are moved to Toulouse since Friday . I moved along . Melanie said you 're in Spain , so I kept checking the refugee lists . Last night appeared your name . It 's weird , remember ... here we met ... 22 years ago . On the banks of the Garonne where you came after school . I haven 't seen the river after the cyclones yet . Well , I don 't have much time . Here ... a passport . Visit me in the Ministry of Environment at the Hotel de l 'Opera . Chloe , my ex-wife . Ombeline Ribot . - I 'm pleased . - Nice to meet you . See you later . I count on you , it 's important . I can 't leave you alone . I imagined her taller . Let 's go drink coffee . It 's like last century , during the war . PARIS EVACUATED ! - TOULOUSE - CAPITAL OF FRANCE ! A newspaper , please . I 'd prefer Bordeaux because I know it better . We could live in a large apartment ... making love and drinking wine . We can have a coffee before you meet your wife , huh ? Shall I leave you some money ? - Afraid you won 't come back ? - No ... I 'll be back soon . I 'll wait over there . I have an appointment with Chloe Laborde . This is your ... Sleeping room until 9 : 00 . and then office until 20 : 00 . I 'm glad I found you . Me too . And what exactly are you doing now ? What a question . Yesterday was a summit meeting with the president . He and is wife have moved to their refuge in Evreux . That 's not a good sign . I still love you , Robinson . And I you . It 's weird to kiss after so long . But it feels not so bad . I believe nothing of that story you told Melanie about that ski resort . Are you still in love with Laetitia ? Yes , but the story ended in Canada . Why don 't we join Melanie , on that boat ? I thought you weren 't alone ? Well , I don 't know ... And who is that Mme. Rideau ? Oh , that 's awesome ... I love that . Damn , here we go again . Chloe Laborde , yes ? Get dressed , quick ! No , I 'm working with decontamination . Send him to room 320 . Okay . Just a minute ... There 's a hotel at Place Esquirol . I 've booked a room in your name . I don 't know if it has a double bed or not . I 'll call you there . If the mobile net isn 't overloaded . Are they many ? How many ? Well , I am free . More free than I 've ever been . Oh , my Laetitia , it 's that kind of freedom that you 're living . I understand you now . - A whiskey . - Coming . Being young means you don 't know what will happen . Maybe it 's not that bad after all . The world has just become young again . Good evening , sir . Have you emigrated too ? - Everything 's okay ? - Everything 's okay . - Have you any news ... - From your wife ? Yes . Is she in Toulouse too ? Yes , she waits for you , on a terrace by the Garonne . - I thought she was with you ... - No , no , absolutely not . - Well , I 'll see what I can do . - Good evening . - Ladies and gentlemen , ... - Iris ? Due to the exceptional TV-program with the President of the Republic ... at 22 : 00 , the second act of the opera is shortened tonight . Would you please sit down ? - Robinson ? - Shut up ! - I must find him . - Please ! - Ombeline . - Robinson ! Can you please move one seat ? Well , here you are ! I feared something had happened ... 'cause you didn 't come back , but this ! Even if he 's your friend . If I hadn 't seen the poster , I 'd never found you . Bastard ! Why do men always abandon me ? Ombeline , relax now . Everything 's fine . I 'd like to see this . I can 't take it ... Die alone ... Abandoned in this wicked world . Ombeline ... What 's happening ? Robinson ! Where were you ? I 've looked everywhere . The President made a statement on TV . They have lost control . Missiles will hit France in 2 hours . After the speech panic will break out . - A plane is waiting for us . - Leave , but where ? No idea . To Australia , an island ... If we could tell Melanie . Chloe , quick ! We 're leaving . Pascal ... Robinson , my ex-husband . Nice to meet you , Robinson . But war is war ... We must hurry . What are you doing ? I 'll stay . - That 's ridiculous . Is it her again ? - No , I don 't know ... I don 't want to die with all those people . We won 't die . It 's the only chance to survive ! - Don 't be stupid ! - Sorry . Then I 'll stay too . Together with you . Wait for me , I 'll be back . I love you . Death to the cowards ! Chloe ! WEDNESDAY , JULY 11 Hello ... Hello ... Is there anyone ? Is there anyone ? Theo ? " I 'll come like a thief in the night ... surprising and unexpected ... " My Robinson ! I thought we 'd meet again ... but in a another world . I 'm so happy . I was in the opera yesterday evening . Short ... life is short . It was the shortest performance of my career . What happened to you ? A rocket launcher at the town square ... My wife just evaporated when it exploded . Damn . You have a daughter , right ? - Yes ... She 's participating in a regatta . I hope she 's unaffected by this ... chaos ... Where 's everyone going ? Many went to the airport . Some returned to find shelter in the station . The airport ... is closed . The planes over the Atlantic Ocean have to turn around . The Americans shoot down everything what comes from abroad . And I 'm here with you . When I saw that everyone escaped from the centre , I came here . Here I felt safe , like at home . You 're not alone . Don 't worry , she 's asleep in your room . Funny , I always thought you ... - That I liked men ? - Yes . That 's right , but I 'm not hardcore . Sometimes I sleep with women too . I can 't resist anything , not even ... Never mind . Miracles still happen . You are here . And we 're together , Robinson . You were the love of my life , Robinson . We belonged together . Me , walking through the streets all night long , ... hoping to meet someone ... who would touch me . You , who squandered your life ... for this charming whore , Lae . I always dreamed of all things we could do together . And right now nothing is impossible ... we are here together . We have only a short time to live , Robinson . Theo ... Don 't . You 're right . Don 't move . I feel fine . For a moment I thought I was somewhere else . You again ... Yes . Theo still asleep ? He just jumped out the window . We must go . You 've an idea where ? No . Are you alone ? - Yes . And you ? - Me too . I know a castle in Lot , shall we go there ? After the attack in Toulouse , the panic throughout the country increases . Last night the president didn 't yet know how to react . Paris is attacked by missiles . Survivors hide underground . - Do we we need it ? - Yes . - Put it on . - Thank you . Who lives in the castle in Lot ? A cousin of my mother . Two years ago he built a nuclear shelter in the cellar . And now the whole world is paranoid ! Do you really believe in using a shelter ? A nuclear winter lasts only six months . When we come out , we 'll be the first tourists in the New World . I 'm hungry . Auberge Des Grottes . Nice interior ... and a warm welcome with the best of regional gastronomy . - We 're closed . - Is there nothing else in the village ? The whole region is contaminated . What a mess , huh ? This night it will happen ... What is that ? - A truffle . Did you know that Theo was my father ? Yes . We 've passionately made love all night ... since it won 't have consequences anymore . This is it . What ? Everything 's dead . No , there are still birds . Iris ? Iris ? Take one . It makes you feel better . I must lie down . Are you coming ? - Yes ? - Yes ... " Death will come and appear in your eyes . " - What ? - The password to enter the castle . Your skin ... Come ... let 's be one . I see you . Death will come and take your eyes . - Death will come and appear in your eyes . - That 's it . - Who are you ? - Robinson Laborde . Sorry , I 'm a little tired . I came here via Iris d 'Arcangues . See you later . Homère Magal , owner of this castle . Do you have news from Iris ? Her mother is worried . She died this afternoon in a hotel room near Cahors . She quietly passed away . I think you 're our last guest . We 're enough people now and the news aren 't good . Paris is lost ... and the army is using missiles . It 's all unsafe now . My internet is still working , so I can read some news ... Auntie ! Auntie , this is Robinson . He told me that Iris , your daughter ... unfortunately died this afternoon . Sincere condolences . Good evening , aunt . At midnight we 'll go to the shelter . I always imagined the end of the world would come ... on a fine summer morning , while everyone sleeps . But until midnight it 's time to party . Just surrender to all the pleasures ... and enjoy a delicious cocktail , from the old France . See you around ! My husband 's still in New York . New York and the entire East Coast were wiped off the map this afternoon . Weird how communication affects everything ... We are all manipulated . I 'm glad I 'm in France . There are incidents here too ... but not such a huge disaster . Excuse me , sir , I 'm from Libourne ... where a virus that attacks the nerves has broken out . Don 't trivialize it . We came from Paris this afternoon Everything 's radioactive there . In two hours we 'll become luminous . Lae ? The hat ... She 's alive . May I ? Not now ... thank you . Do you know where I can use internet ? There ? Thank you . Sir , excuse me , may I just check my email ? It takes a minute only . Go away . It 's okay . Listen my friends ! We currently live in the time of the end of the World . Soon there will be days of wrath like never before . But God will not allow that humanity disappears . Christ will return ... to put an end to all human insanity . Crime will disappear . Truth will survive . Families will be honored again . And parents will learn again to love their children . THURSDAY , JULY 12 Is anybody here ? Tell me , why are you still alive ? - What happened ? - We poisoned them all . Didn 't you drink blue cocktail , blue like France ? - No . - You can stay if you want . We can survive for a year in the shelter . I 'll go to Paris . - What ? - Hello , sir . This road is closed until further notice . Go to the cave of Pech-Merle . There 's a shelter . - Follow the arrows , no discussion ! - I 'm not discussing . What are you doing ? FRIDAY , JULY 13 Damn ! SATURDAY , JULY 14 All the days that have been ... Lae ? Cuckoo ... Robinson ! It worked ! Yes ... I 'm ready to die . So am I. I 'm afraid .

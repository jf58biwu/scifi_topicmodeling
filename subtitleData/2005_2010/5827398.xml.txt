 Previously on " Heroes " : Peter Petrelli . My name is Hiro Nakamura . I 'm from the future . I have a message for you . The cheerleader , you have to save her . It 's the only way to prevent it . It 's the only way to prevent it . Prevent what ? Everything . He says that we all meet up . Somehow . Sometime in the future I guess . I see . He says something bad is gonna happen , but we can stop it . To die here . With you . But not before I show them how to kill you and stop the bomb . Whether you are 16 , or 64 ... I will be there for you . Always . 11 years and I 'm still directing traffic . I wish you could see what I see . We 're gonna have a baby ! I want you to know that I would never let anything happen to you . You 're gonna win your election . I 'll see to that . Hello ? Mr. Isaac ? Mr. Isaac ! You . Me ? What are you doing here ? You 're not supposed to be here . None of this is supposed to be here . ( Hiro ) It was an accident . We time traveled . ( Ando ) What happened to the city ? The bomb . The bomb still happened . It was all supposed to change . Five years ago , a man named Sylar exploded in the heart of the city , changing the world forever . I thought I had it all figured out . I thought I had it all beat . I look upset . Go . Talk to yourself . No way .. I scare me .. You do it . Excuse me . Future Hiro , what is this ? This is a map of time . The events that led up to the bomb .. That destroyed half the city , five years ago today . I 've been working on it for years . Why ? To determine .. the precise moment to go back in time .. To change the future .. I finally found it .. Save the cheerleader ... Save the world ! You visited Peter Petrelli with this message . Yes , did he do it ? Did Peter save her ? Yes , he did . Claire is still alive . Which means Sylar never took her power . Which means you were able to kill him , right ? Me ? Kill Sylar ? You didn 't ? Then .. I need to get you back there .. On the day the bomb explodes , You need to kill Sylar . You kill someone ? This string here . This is you . It crosses with the black string .. Sylar .. here .. This is the moment that you killed him on the day after the election .. I stabbeb him , but he regenerated . Because he had the cheerleader 's power . Exactly . But if Peter saved her .. Sylar can now be killed .. But I can 't go back . I can 't control my powers . If I try , Ando and I can appear anywhere . They must have spotted you . Hiro ! Go ! Come on . Lets get out of here . Well , what do you know ? Hiro Nakamura . Go after his friends ! The Haitian stays with me . I want to take him in personally . What ? [ Matt grunts ] Hey ! What 's going on ? Get out of those clothes . You 're sticking out like a sore thumb . What happened to Hiro ? Who was that ? Homeland Security . The government ? They 're taking him to a special holding facility in midtown . How can you be so sure ? Because that 's where they take all the terrorists . Why would anyone think that Hiro 's a- - You ? A terrorist ? After Sylar exploded , the world became a very dark place . And that is why we need to change it . Get him back so he can kill Sylar . Then let 's go get Hiro . You can freeze time . We 'll teleport in . No , no , it 's not that simple . The Haitian has a way of stopping my powers . We need help . There 's only one person who 's powerful enough to get us through . Peter Petrelli . We 're going to Las Vegas . BUYO presents Subtitle by BUYO 30 / 360 This is where we 're going to find Peter Petrelli ? No . This is where we find his girlfriend . ( man on P.A. ) And now in the center ring , gentlemen , give it up for the main event , Jessica ! music Maybe the future 's not so bad . You have one song , two minutes , and $ 500 . After that , you 're out of here . You got me , Hiro ? It 's me , Niki . Ando . Do you remember ? Is this how you 're gonna use your time ? I need to find Peter . It 's important . War 's over , General Chow . We lost , remember ? Peter 's not interested . ( Future Hiro ) You could talk to him . Tell him it 's about stopping Sylar . You say that name again , and I will break your neck . Do you know where Bennet is ? As far as I know , he 's still rustling cattle in Texas . How are the receipts tonight , Marco ? It was a good night , ma 'am . Good . You don 't have to be here . I told you that I can handle it . What did he want ? What do you think ? He 's still trying to stop an exploding man . Hey , Sylar 's dead . I sent him off to Bennet . Just let him deal . Of all days , huh ? Today is just another day . You lost your son , Niki- - It 's called letting go . Maybe you should give it a try . Or would you rather go off with your buddy and fight the pain away ? I 'm not going anywhere . This is all misunderstanding . Hiro Nakamura . Born Osaka , Japan , to Kaito and Ishi . Teleportation . Stopping time . Prison breaks . Attacks against U.S. interests . No , I don 't think there 's any misunderstanding . Prison breaks ? ( Matt ) Two years ago , you killed a lot of good men when you raided the National Science Center in Raleigh . No , I know myself . I 'm not a killer . How can you not remember that ? Because I do not know what you are talking about . I 'm talking about men like you and Sylar ruining it for the rest of us . Making us live in fear , captivity , and hiding . Making us choose sides . Tearing families apart . I would never tear a family apart . [ thinking ] I just want to be a hero . I don 't know what kind of game you 're playing , Nakamura . What you 're hiding . But I 'm gonna get it out of you . That 's right . We got him . We 've been after him for years , and today he decides to get sloppy just before the anniversary ? ( Matt ) I thought that 'd be good news to announce at the speech tomorrow . This can 't be a coincidence . They 're up to something . I need to know what it is . That could be a problem . He doesn 't seem to remember anything about the last five years . You sure it 's- - It 's really him ? It 's not a trick or an illusion or something ? Anything seems possible these days . There be something we 've overlooked . You 're a mind reader , Parkman . Rip it out of him . If you can 't do it , I 'll get someone who can . [ exhales ] Yes , sir , Mr. President . Send in the professor . ( Nathan ) I 'm sorry to keep you waiting . We 've captured Hiro Nakamura in Manhattan . That 's excellent news , Mr. President . It seems we 're running into some problems . You 're the only person I trust to figure out what 's going on up there . I 'll be on the first flight to New York . Thank you . That 's not why I asked you here . Please sit down . Five years ago , you and I allowed a man to blow up in New York . Millions of lives came to an end , and the world was changed . Soon after we sat down in my office . Do you remember ? Of course . We made a pact to eliminate such danger at any cost . Billions in research later ... how close are we to that ? We , uh ... we 're not much closer to reversing their condition than when we started . What 's the problem ? It 's hard coded in their DNA . It 's like they 're a separate species . We cannot change who they are , Mr. President . So in other words , we 've failed . No , no , the measures we 've put in place- - They 're not working . We 've outlawed their breeding . We 've confined their movement . We police them . We track them . Their attacks continue . Their population is increasing exponentially . Your numbers . Yesterday in Santa Cruz , a boy somehow sucked all the oxygen out of the air . Suffocated his entire middle school . My God . These events are increasing . People are anticipating another Sylar . In your original assessment , you posited a potential solution . Extinction . Yes , but I never meant to suggest that- - " They wouldn 't be the first species " to be exterminated for the preservation of another . " Your words . I was talking about the natural order of things . What you 're talking about is genocide . Self-defense . And I 'm not suggesting it lightly . We 've just run out of options . You haven 't slept in five years , Mohinder . We need to put an end to this . You 're one of them , Nathan . Am I supposed to march you off to the gas chambers as well ? I 'm thankful for the secrets you 've kept . But let 's be honest . I can fly . I 'm hardly dangerous . I value your opinion as a scientist and a friend . But if I gave you five years , ten years , 20 more years , be honest with me ... could you reverse it ? No . Probably not . Then we need to start thinking about Plan B. I don 't care about five years ago . What are you planning for tonight ? You are like me . Special . Why do you want to hurt other special people ? Yeah , it 's Parkman . Suresh ? What 's he doing there ? Watch him . ( Bennet ) You ready ? Pad turns red ... you 're one of them and they 'll arrest you . Pad turns blue , you 're free to go . From now on you will be the Cranes from Boise , Idaho . We 've enclosed back stories , references , and money , okay ? How do we know when we 're safe ? You don 't . Not ever . Always keep a refrigerated sample of this on your person . Buy a thermos . Now you 're gonna have to be vigilant . Always on the lookout . Can you do that , son ? Yes , sir . Good man . Okay , we have to go . Do whatever it takes to protect him . It 's out of the question . It 's Homeland Security . I need help getting in there . These people trust me . They come to me to keep them hidden . You 're asking me to do the exact opposite ! I 'm only asking for the ones that I brought to you . D.L. , Candice , Molly Walker . And they 'll all be safe when we succeed . Sorry , I can 't help you . He saved your daughter 's life . Excuse me ? Your daughter . The cheerleader . She 's alive because of Hiro . What is he talking about ? Five years ago , I asked Peter to save Claire from Sylar at Homecoming . My friend tells me he did it . Claire 's alive . Isn 't she ? You guys sit tight . I 'll see what I can do . Each string represents a person . Every action , every choice . How people came together , how they were torn apart . It 's a living map of the past . Why would a terrorist care so much about the past ? Maybe he thought he could change it . Hiro Nakamura can stop time . Teleport by folding space . Theoretically , he can fold time as well . ( Matt ) So you 're saying he 's a time traveler . Is that any stranger than being able to read someone 's mind ? Yeah , it is . Haven 't you ever wished you could change the past ? Set your life down a different path ? I used to be that guy . Wishing it and making it happen are two different things . Not for Nakamura it isn 't . Look here . These two dates seem to be the focal points . Both in the past . The first is the bomb . The other- - What ? What is it ? The other 's the day I received my father 's ashes . I was with Peter Petrelli that day . On the subway , he said he saw a man who could freeze time . Nakamura ? I don 't know . He said he had a message for Peter . What ? What was the message ? Hey ! What was the message ? Save the cheerleader ... save the world . All right , here are you chilequiles and your waffle platter . Now just holler at me if y 'all need anything else . Okay ? ( news reporter on TV ) Right now we 're watching live footage of the President approaching Marine 1 for his trip to his home state , New York . The White House promises a major policy shift ... You know , Sandra , for a girl who 's supposed to hate the President , you sure do perk up whenever he 's on . A guy could get jealous . He 's old enough to be my father . Hey , so what did you think of Rafferty 's ? For the reception . You were supposed to check it out , remember ? I 'm sorry . I forgot . You 're not getting cold feet , are you ? No , of course not . My feet are very warm . Two pairs of socks warm . Well , good . 'Cause I 'm kind of crazy about you . You know that . The creepy guy with glasses is back . Sitting in your section again . There we go . Thanks . Would you like a scoop of ice cream on that ? Um , no , not today , thank you . But my table 's a little sticky . Someone knows about you , Claire . You need to leave as soon as possible . There 's a bag on the chair to my right . Leave ? What am I supposed to tell Andy ? Tell him nothing . Just go . I can 't do that to him . We 're getting married . Have you told him ? No . All I want is a normal life , Dad . I 've done my best to provide that for you . But people are starting to ask questions . Now I am trying to control the information , but it 's not safe here anymore . I 've been hiding for five years . California , Nevada . I brought you back to Midland . Only after Mom left . ( TV ) This word just coming in . We have breaking news ... I just want you to be safe . ... where enforcement agents have just bravely rounded up over 200 undocumented individuals as part of a coordinated nationwide sweep . This has been cited as the department 's most successful operation since the Linderman Act was passed four years ago . Homeland Security spokesmen praised the near-perfect execution of local police , citing zero casualties on the enforcement side ... Enjoy your pie . Officials were also sure to note that community tips ... The incident resulted in the safe transport of suspects to special holding facilities within their states , where the individuals will meet with federally provided attorneys to discuss their legal options . And a note to our viewers . If you see any suspicious activity , please ... D.L. can phase inside the buildings . Candice 's illusion can distract the guards . Hey , what about me ? You 'll help too . That 's not what I meant . What happened to me ? Where am I ? Am I rich ? Married ? I can 't tell you that . Why not ? Because ... The whole time / space continuum ... might explode because you were impatient . So ... my friend is still in there . There 's something I need to tell you . We already caught you . Two Hiros . Son of a bitch ! He really can travel through time . Unh ! What ? Your friends got away . If they were my friends , I wouldn 't have called you , Matt . Yeah , thanks for the heads up . That 's the deal , right ? I turn you on to the dangerous refugees , and you let me help the harmless ones . Doesn 't hurt that we 're both harboring children of interest . Of course , mine isn 't the President 's daughter . She 's getting married . Mazel-Tov . I guess . Have you , uh ... you heard anything from Janice ? You ever wish you did something different ? Wish you took a different path ? Every day . You did right by her , Matt . You did right by him . Thanks . I really appreciate all you 've done for them . What are you doing ? ! I 'm ending our arrangement . Unfortunately , I have to explain to the President that there 's a second Hiro Nakamura out there . Then I gotta tell him how I let him get away . See , I can 't come back empty handed . Now tell me where she is . No . Let 's elope . What ? Let 's elope . Right now , run away . I 'm thinking Vegas . We 'll pack our bags . Get hitched tonight . Take off , see the world . What do you think ? [ chuckles ] I think you 're crazy . Maybe . Probably . But I 've got my reasons . And I promise I 'll tell you everything . Will you do it ? For me ? I 'll do anything for you . Let me get my things . Okay . Coffee ? Can I get something for you , sir ? I don 't know , Claire . What 's good ? Save the cheerleader , save the world . What does that mean ? How do you know that ? Five years ago , Peter Petrelli and I were on the subway . He said someone stopped time . That 's what you do , Mr. Nakamura . Peter and I were on our way to see Isaac Mendez that day . An artist who can paint the future . A lot of his work is remarkably accurate . Except this . Is that a new 9th Wonder ? ( Mohinder ) The events in this comic . History didn 't happen like this . You didn 't kill Sylar . You 're trying to change the past . Trying to stop Sylar , is that it ? If you could save millions of lives , wouldn 't you ? Thank you . Is that really you , Ando ? Why are you so surprised to see me ? He didn 't tell you . What ? You 're ... dead . How ? In New York . The bomb . Really ? Do you remember how he used to be ? All full of hope and optimism ? ( Ando ) Of course . That 's the Hiro I know . He went away the day you died . Between you and me , I think you 're the reason why he became so obsessed with trying to change it all back . He wants to save you . ( Niki ) Hey , baby , you in here ? Nakamura was trying to find a way to kill Sylar before he exploded . You actually think he can make that happen ? I do . Think about it . Without Sylar , the world would have never considered these people to be dangerous . None of this would 've ever happened . Imagine the possibilities . If he kills Sylar , we can change the past . I don 't have that luxury . I need to find answers in the here and now . Genocide is not an answer . Is that what this is about ? You 're feeling bad because you came up short ? It 's wrong . I was elected to make hard decisions . I understand how things work . And how is this going to work ? Today I 'm going to announce that you 've developed a treatment to reverse this . You 're going to lie . The world will cheer . And what happens when people start dying ? I 'll say you made a mistake . A fatal error . At first , the world will mourn . They 'll be united in grief . And then they 'll just be united . Mohinder , I need to know if I can trust you . I need to know if you 're with me . Are you with me on this ? Of course . Mr. President . There are two of them , sir . Two ... Hiros . You 're sure ? ( Matt ) I am . I think we got the younger one . It explains the gaps in his knowledge . I want to put him down . No . I want Dr. Suresh to do it . Yes , sir . Mr. President ... that 's not the only thing that I found in Texas . ( Nathan ) I thought you were dead . You have no idea how important you are to me , Claire . I 'm not important . I 'm just a waitress . We both know that isn 't true . You made everyone afraid of us . I made everyone aware of us . Fear is just the natural response . You can 't blame them , really . We 're more powerful than they are . More important . We 're special . Who are you to decide who 's special and who 's not ? I 'm the leader of the free world . For all I know , I 'm the most special person there is . Lord knows I found enough power . Met a lot of special people . Like this girl named Candice who allowed me to become President . But I 'm done . I just want to eliminate the competition . I don 't need any more power . Especially not after you . Sylar . I 've waited a long time for this . You 've always wanted to become a kendo master . I studied in Tohoku , so technically I 'm a Battojutsu master . Why do you always have to correct me ? Because there 's a difference . What difference ? You 're still a hero . You became everything you wanted to be and I .. I became dead . Peter told you ? Looks loke you fought a lot of battles . More than I 'd like to remember . How was it ? Not nearly as fun .. without you . Remember what we promised each other ? Yeah , I remember . Then why can 't you just let it go ? Hey , I 'm not the one who can 't let go . You gonna call yourself Jessica on stage night after night and act like nothing gets to you ? We both know that 's not true . That is not who you are . It is now . You 're gonna look in that mirror , but nobody is looking back but you . She is gone , Niki . D.L. is gone . Micah is gone . You have to accept your loss . Jessica was right all along . Look out for yourself . Don 't get attached . I don 't buy it . Then why are you in such a hurry to leave me ? My own reasons . And I 'm not leaving anything . I 'll be back . What reasons ? What makes you think that you are so important ? That you have to fix everything ? Because I do . Why ? Why does it fall on your shoulders to save everyone ? Because it was me ! The bomb ? It was me ! I killed all those people . I killed Micah . No , it was Sylar . Everyone knows ! It wasn 't . Nathan lied . He lied to protect me . He told everybody that it was Sylar . Think about it . You know me . You know what I can do . Listen , if there is a chance that Hiro can undo this , I have to help him . You walk out that door , you don 't come back . Is everything okay ? No . Let 's go fix it . My fellow Americans , fellow New Yorkers , please let us take a moment to remember the men , women , and children who were taken from us five years ago . Five bells for the five years of sorrow . ( Nathan ) Sacrifice ... is something that we 're all too familiar with . We 've all lost . We 've all mourned . And we 've all had to become soldiers , heroes . [ alarm ] Protecting one another from the gravest of dangers . This is a battle that none of us wanted . One that we entered with a heavy heart . Should we freeze time ? ( Peter ) No , I haven 't had a good fight in years . ( Nathan ) Knowing that the enemy was ourselves . We 've won battles the world over . Not only against those that would do us harm , but against poverty , reclaiming the environment ... Upstairs our powers will be blocked by the Haitian . ( Peter ) We need to take him out so the other Hiro can teleport out of here . But there are guards up there . Won 't they be waiting for us with guns ? ( Nathan ) But we do not forget the price that we 've had to pay . The laws that we 've had to pass to keep our citizens safe . Put ' em all down . No warning . ( Nathan ) To preserve our way of life . Our hope has always been that a great peace is on the horizon . That one day wounds would be healed and salvation could be found . I 'm here to tell you that that day is today . I 'm proud to announce that we have developed a treatment , a method to reverse the genetic code . The first clinics will open next month across the world . And soon , we can begin lifting restrictions . Cities and families can be reunited . And we can finally live without fear . We 've been vigilant . We have been uncompromising . And our efforts have paid off . The nightmare is over . The world is saved . Why are we waiting , sir ? Why can 't we just bring the fight to them ? Because we 'd lose . The Haitian 's up here , so up here , they 're powerless . Weapons free . Shoot on sight . I must go back to stop explosion . You know I 'm telling truth . Hold him down . Please don 't do this ! I 'm sorry . Come on . Come on , come on ! You 're letting me go . Why ? I think I 'm supposed to . ( Mohinder ) I 'll take you where it 's safe . So you can change all this . No , future me ! He 's good guy ! Mohinder . Peter ? Hiro ! Ando ! You need to go back now . But how do I return to the right moment ? I don 't know how to do that . I 'll take you . Come on , come on , come on , move it ! Move it ! Sir . The Haitian 's down ! The Haitian is down ! What about Nakamura ? We can 't get to him , sir . Your brother is holding us off . If I don 't get reinforcements now , it 's all over , sir . Nakamura will escape . Mr. President ? Mr. Pres- - [ disconnects call ] Bust the door ! I 'm dead . We need to get out of here . I 'm dead . Get in there Parkman .. end this . Yes sir . Move it ! Brother versus brother . Its almost My brother can 't walk through walls , who are you ? I know a friend . The guy they blame for blowing up New York .. But you and I know the real story don 't we Pete ? Cmon Lets go . You must leave . Now . You 're gonna pay for what you did to Nathan . What you did in his name . What I did . When I kill Nathan he don 't return againts his own kind . Liar . Subtitle by BUYO

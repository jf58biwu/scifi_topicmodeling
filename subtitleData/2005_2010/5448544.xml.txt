 Previously on Heroes . We have a problem . Sylar , he 's gone . Nathan , what are you ... Hey . I think I 'm in trouble , Pete . Ever think that we can just live , Noah ? Out in the open ? No . I 'm a friend , Tracy . What is this place ? Home . Please take this . To find your way back here . I pushed Nathan 's memories into your mind . I made your body think that it was him . I gotta go find Nathan . Get my body back . Then I kill every single person even remotely involved . Police ! Freeze . What the hell are you doing ? I 'm crossing that line . You idiot . You 'll die with me . I know . Gun ! Where is Charlie ? I 'm the only one who knows exactly where your sweet Charlie is . And you can save her , but only if you do exactly what I ask you to do . I made a mistake . About eight weeks ago . This green earth has given us so much . Feels good to give back what we can . Then why don 't you give back Charlie ? You 're an evil man , Butterfly Man . You must release Charlie from wherever you are holding her . I have a way for you to earn her freedom . I met a man eight weeks ago . He had something I wanted . A film from 1961 . His name was Mohinder Suresh . I know Dr. Suresh . I don 't need to time travel . I can find him right now . Dr. Suresh is dead . You killed Dr. Suresh ? I need you to go back eight weeks , Hiro . To a motel room in Texas . To save his life ? No . To save that film , before he destroyed it . Once you return , deliver it to me , your sweet Charlie will be set free . I don 't know if I can even time travel anymore . Then you 're gonna have to try very , very hard . Your sweet Charlie 's life depends on it . Samuel . Yeah . We 're done here . Let 's go . So India was connected to Australia ? Mmm-hmm . As well as Madagascar and most of Southern Africa . Now , together , they made a supercontinent called Pangaea . That is until India broke off and began to migrate north . Everything keeps changing , doesn 't it ? Indeed . Come on . One of the great lessons of plate tectonics is that all things are subject to evolution , even the earth beneath our feet . Remember to read chapter six before class . Thank you , Dr. Suresh . Your students adore you , Mohinder . Teaching is what you were born to do . It does feel good to be back in the classroom again . Listen , I was thinking of making lamb biryani for dinner tonight . You promised you were going to throw this away . I am . It was delivered over a month ago . I assumed you meant immediately . Look , it 's all of my father 's work from Coyote Sands in the ' 60s . And I didn 't mean to lie to you . It 's just hard to let go . We have a good life , Mohinder . A good , simple life here . Every time you dig into your father 's research , you disappear into a rabbit hole . It only leads you to a dark place . Perhaps you 're right . You doing okay ? You 've been sitting here staring at that poster for two hours . You ever wonder what it would be like ? Running off and joining a carnival ? Yeah , that 'd be a dream come true . Living with a bunch of fire-breathing freaks . Just because they 're different doesn 't make them freaks . Seriously , can you imagine spending your life in some trailer , moving from town to town ? And you spend your life where , in some crappy diner ? I 'm sorry . Are you sure you 're okay ? Yeah . I 'm great . I 'm fantastic . My God . I 'm sorry . If something 's going on , we 'll figure it out . Pete , it 's not like I lost my car keys . I lost a week of my life . Yeah , and you woke up in a carnival . You sure you want to remember that ? Senator Petrelli , welcome back . It 's good to be back , Elizabeth . Do me a favor . Will you get my schedule out of the front office , please ? Sure . That was awfully casual . Yeah . I 'm telling you , Pete , it doesn 't make sense . What 's that ? Even if my lost weekend was just some crazy bender under the big top , a senator going off the grid , that ought to raise one or two alarms , don 't you think ? Mom say anything when you talked to her ? She 's in Washington , wants to meet us here . What are you thinking ? Talk to me . I thought I had a handle on this , Pete . But these last few weeks , it 's just been like I don 't know who I am anymore . You 're just the last guy I figured for an identity crisis , Nathan . Senator ? Go ahead . The good news is , your day 's wide open . We cleared your calendar when you went on vacation . Vacation ? Sir , your mother said you weren 't sure how long you 'd be gone , so ... My mother ? Right . Thank you . Déjà vu . So sorry , you startled me . Can I help you ? Rene ? It 's okay . Did my mother send you ? Don 't come any closer . I 've come here to speak with Peter . Okay . It 's okay . Come on . What are you doing here ? I came to warn you , Peter . You need to know the truth . Freeze ! Claire ! Claire , it 's me , Tracy Strauss . And you were breaking and entering in my dad 's apartment because ... I really need to see him . Yeah , well , that 's why God invented doorbells . I didn 't mean to . I put my hand on the doorknob and it just ... Look , do you know where he is ? Something is going wrong with my power . I can 't control it . I didn 't know where else to go . Tracy , you 're freezing . So this was my mother 's idea to clean up Nathan 's mess ? She sends you to wipe out our memories ? It 's what she wants me to do , but I cannot do it . Okay . And why is that ? Your mother is blinded by her emotions . There are some lines that should never be crossed . Why do you keep looking at him ? It is not up to me to reveal this thing . The decision must be yours . The answer you seek is here . If you go , Peter , go alone . What you discover may be more terrible than you can bear . This is Dr. Chandra Suresh . And this is entry number four , Coyote Sands Relocation Center , March 5th , 1961 . I 've been trying to alert the authorities here to the potential danger of gathering so many persons with abilities in one location . My concern centers around an apparent force , small but measurable , that emanates from all such individuals . When two or more of these forces are proximate , they amplify exponentially . Like a kind of gravity or magnetism . An abnormal spike in seismic activity as of late appears to be emanating from one of the individuals being held here . A pregnant woman , by the name of ... This is entry number 21 . It is my intention to document the birth of the child . There has been an enormous release of seismic activity throughout the day . Doctor , he 's crowning . I fear that this child may indeed ... I 'm coming . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Don 't worry . Nurse ! You okay ? Yeah . It 's better . Why is this happening to me ? I thought it would be a good idea to make you some tea . You sure you 're okay ? Thanks , Claire . What happened ? The water started to freeze . It is happening over and over again , and I can 't stop it ! Tracy , just calm down . Try to take a deep breath . Oh , no . Claire ? Can you hear me ? Oh , my God . ... six . I really thought we were done with this cloak and dagger stuff . I still can 't figure out why the Haitian didn 't want me in the loop . Well , doesn 't matter now . This just gets better and better . Check it out . Yeah . - We 're good ? - Good . What do you got ? It 's a body . What is it ? It 's me . It 's not you . It could be a shape shifter or something . It 's just not ... There 's gotta be a reason the Haitian wanted you to see this . This is just weird . What ? It 's all right . You 're now Nathan Petrelli . What did you see ? Bits and pieces , I think . A hotel room . Sylar . Sylar ? That 's old news . The guy 's been dead for weeks . I know . I know . I heard Parkman . Matt ? His voice , he was angry . Whatever 's going on , we 're not gonna get any straight answers out of Mom or the Haitian . Okay , so we gotta find Matt . Where is he ? LA . Let 's go find him . You sure ? I 'm not sure of anything . I 'm gonna get you in the bath . Tracy . No , I heal . I heal . It 's , like , what I do . It 's okay . Do you think you ever really know somebody ? God . Are you hearing yourself ? Yeah . Look , you know what I see when I look at all this ? I see the big brother who would let me win by a nose when we would race . I see the Naval officer who would rearrange his leave so that I could have a good birthday . The past couple of years , I 've seen a guy that saved my ass more than a few times . I made a lot of mistakes , Pete . So have I. Don 't beat yourself up over it . Senator Petrelli . Yeah . I found something . I just hope this isn 't the Matt Parkman you 're looking for . He 's in a hospital in Texas , under guard . They 're saying he tried to commit suicide by cop . Thank you , Elizabeth . Multiple gunshot wounds . Yeah . He 's in critical condition . You know , Nathan , I can heal people now . If we can get in , I think I can save him . Hiro , tick-tock , tick-tock . I 'm trying . You can do this , Hiro . I have faith in you . Mohinder ? Mira , I have made a remarkable discovery . There 's a power , an actual quantifiable force ... You promised me , Mohinder . Mira , this is important . Using my father 's equations , I built a device , a sort of compass that I can use ... Will you listen to yourself ? Possessed again by these voices in your head . You don 't understand . By following this compass ... Okay . If the child on that film is still alive and surrounds himself with a large enough number of specials , he can become the most ... Stop . I 'm begging you , Mohinder . Please think very carefully about what you have . About what you have to lose . I love you . But if you disappear again , I will not wait for you to return . Can you help him ? I can try . Matt . You 're okay . You 're okay . It 's me , Peter . What happened ? You 're okay . Good things do come to those who wait . Son of a bitch , get out of my head ! You 're in the hospital . I brought you back . No , you don 't understand . This is exactly what he wants . What 's he talking about ? Bring him closer , Parkman . One touch is all I need , then you can have your miserable life back . I can have my body back . Shut up ! Hey , guys , run . Get away from me before he comes back . - Before who comes back ? - Sylar ! Sylar 's dead , Matt . No , he 's in my head . He 's trying to control my mind . I know this sounds crazy , but if he controls me , if he gets my power , he 's gonna jump back into his body . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Slow down , Matt . What do you mean , " his body " ? This should be good . Nathan , you 're dead . Sylar murdered you . He cut your throat . I used my power to purge his mind from his body and put your thoughts in . You 're weakening , Parkman . I 'm not gonna let you do this . I don 't have time for all the five stages of grief . Let 's go right from denial to acceptance . Oh , my ... Oh , my God . You son of a bitch . Nathan , it 's true . No , no , no ! I 'm so sorry . Stay back . You 're saying I 'm Sylar ? Yes , but I can make it all right . All you need to do is take my hand . Don 't ! Don 't take his hand . It all makes sense , Pete . Nathan , get away from him . Stop ! It all adds up . These new powers aren 't mine , they 're Sylar 's . I don 't exist . Doesn 't make sense . I don 't buy that . Take my hand , Nathan . He 's controlling you . Take my hand now . No ! No ! Do it . Take my hand . I 'll kill you first ! Nathan , no ! It 's okay , Pete . Matt 's right . It 's time to end it . One touch , Nathan , and it 's over . No ! Don 't touch him . You touch him , he 's got my power , his mind will go back into his body . Stop ! Stop ! You . Back away from the prisoner . Take my hand . Do it now . I said get away . Back away ! No ! No . Nathan . Nathan , where is he ? Nathan , where is he ? Pete , come here . We got to get out of here . No ! Nathan ! Nathan , is he in you ? The son of a bitch , is he in you ? They 're in here . Can I help you with something ? I hope so . I 'm looking for someone who may or may not even exist . If he does , his name would be Samuel Sullivan . I 'm Joseph Sullivan , proprietor . The man you 're looking for is my brother . Come with me . If my evidence is correct , your brother may be capable of magnifying his powers simply by being near others with abilities . " Powers , abilities ... " I 'd like to help you , Doctor , but I 'm afraid I have no idea what you 're talking about . I thought you were going to build the fire . Figured Edgar and Damian could handle it . I 'm Samuel . Samuel Sullivan ? Dr. Suresh here has a few questions for me . He 's writing a book on the life of traveling carnies . People want to read a thing like that ? It 's a colorful and exotic world . Why don 't you join the others at the fire pit ? I 'm sure they could use your help . Yeah , of course . I 've just traveled 8,000 miles to speak with your brother . If you 're gonna try and stop me , you better have a damn good reason . Please , come inside . When you came in the room , I was already dead . You don 't remember seeing anyone else in that room . You took me to the morgue , but that 's all you remember . And do me a favor , take off all your clothes . Let me give you my clothes . Yeah , good idea . Hurry up , let 's go , let 's go . Come on . Why are we here , Nathan ? I shouldn 't be around people right now . Something happened to me out there , Pete . What ? I nearly put you through a wall with the flick of my hand . If Sylar gets into my head the way he got into Parkman 's ... I can 't risk that with you . There 's a road around here somewhere . You find your way home . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Go ahead . I 'll be right behind you . The images on that film leave little doubt . The destruction your brother is capable of ... I 'm well aware of what he 's capable of . But Samuel himself has no idea , and it 's been my life 's work to keep it that way . To keep him in the dark about the true nature of his power . Soon after our release from internment at Coyote Sands , my mother told me the truth about Samuel . You saw it on film , my mother lived it . She knew exactly how dangerous he could become . I 've kept our community small in number to ensure Samuel 's power remains subdued . I love my brother . But he 's become a man of great ambition . Somewhere inside , he can taste it , the immense potential he was born with . Under the right circumstances , your brother 's powers could increase a thousandfold . The information on that film ... Burn the film . Go back to India . We must do everything possible to keep this genie in the bottle . How do I know I can trust you ? I 've watched over him for 40 years and everything 's been just fine . You 're no longer welcome here . Mira , it 's me . You were right . This was all a mistake . I should 've left that film in the trash . I should 've left that box unopened . I miss you . I 'll be on the next plane home . Be careful , Dr. Suresh . Evil Butterfly Man will be coming for you . You know , you have not lost control of your abilities in over an hour . Whatever is happening with you , I don 't think it 's physical . It 's psychological . Great . I panic attack with powers . When did it start ? Just this morning . I was sitting in this diner thinking about ... About what ? About changing everything . My entire life . I 've been so lost , Claire . I tried so hard to put my old life back together , but once I did , nothing fit anymore . Then I met this strange man named Samuel . He lives with a group of people ... Who all have abilities . Yeah , I met him , too . He invited me to join them , to move to this place where we 're all accepted . I think I might do it . Give up everything . Start a new life . Maybe you should . Maybe that 's what your body is telling you it wants . It 's great to have someone to talk to about all this . It 's hard to find a friend out there in the normal world . Someone you can trust . Yeah . I had something like that . I 'm pretty sure that 's over . It just sounded so good on paper . " College . " Now I 'm starting to wonder if ... It 's hard out there for girls like us . Ladies . How was your day ? You know , same old , same old . I need to know what was on that film . It 's about my ability , isn 't it ? A way for me to increase my power a thousandfold . Tell me ! Your brother warned me about you . After all these years , he 's been betraying me ? Holding me back so that he could keep playing the king . This is your last chance . Tell me what was on that film . Never . I will learn the truth . And I will do everything I can to stop you . I 'm sorry . Hiro ? Hello , old friend . I 'm not the Hiro Nakamura you know . I 've come eight weeks from the future . To save my life ? No . To save this film . In the future I come from , you were dead . I was murdered right here in this room . How did you know I would need that Kevlar vest ? My time travel is not so good lately . The first time I tried , I arrived 10 minutes from now . Wasn 't pretty . If I hadn 't gone right to Samuel , he would have never known the secrets of his power . My investigation has corrupted him . We have to stop him , Hiro . And we will . But first , you have to disappear for eight more weeks , until he releases Charlie . Charlie ? Yes . Samuel is holding captive the woman I love until I deliver this film . Hiro , this man is extremely dangerous . I can 't just go away for eight weeks while he consolidates his power . Please . If he knew I spared your life , he will never release Charlie . I understand your concern . And I appreciate all that you 've done for me , but our primary focus must be stopping Samuel . I will not risk Charlie 's life . Well , then , we 'll have to agree to disagree , Hiro . If you will not disappear until Charlie is safe , then I will have to make you disappear . What do you mean ... Sorry . He used to say , " Put your finger in a bucket of water , pull it out , " and see how fast the hole fills up . " It takes a lot to ... It takes a lot . You have your film . Now I want Charlie . Soon . I 'm sorry your friend had to die . Mr. Ahmadi . Time for your medication . My name is Mohinder Suresh . My name is Mohinder ... Janice , honey , it 's me . Look , this is tough to explain into a machine . Remember I told you there was a guy inside my head taking control of my mind , a monster named Sylar ? Well , I just want to let you know the craziness of the last few weeks is finally over . And Sylar 's gone . He 's gone back into his own body . I think he got what he wanted . I 'm not really sure what I 'm doing here . Not even sure what I hope to find . I just know that I can 't go on living my old life anymore . I 'm glad you called , Tracy . I hoped you would . I felt a real connection between us . There 's something I 'm gonna ask of you . A way for you to use your gifts to help make this a better world for all people of abilities . Together we can accomplish great things . You have unique talents , Tracy . People like you ... Nathan , this idea , this thought that you 're ... Sylar ? Yeah . Change of voice , change of face , still him underneath . These hands have killed dozens of people , Pete . Friends of ours . Whoever Nathan Petrelli was , he 's gone now . Just some random thoughts in a mass murderer 's head . Okay , look , assuming that I believe any of that , what would it matter ? I mean , didn 't Matt say that he forced Sylar out ? You really think Matt could purge every sick thought from that head ? To the rest of the world , I 'm Nathan Petrelli , Pete , but every time you look at me , the way you 're looking at me right now , you 're gonna see Sylar . Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me I 'm wrong , Pete .

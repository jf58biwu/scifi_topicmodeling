 Mom , this can 't be the answer ! . You won 't feel a thing ! I don 't have the key ! I swear I don 't ! Jezebel ! Jezebel , give me the key . Give me the key ! I solved the riddle ! No ! Mrs Garneau ? It 's Julie . You 've been tailing me all week . No . Not a week ... Lapointe ! It 's been 6 months , not a week . - Lapointe ! - Didn 't I tell you ? Take this and scram ! You completely screwed this up ! Sorry , Biron . No ordinary storm . I can 't get wet . - What ? Shut up ! Gimme the camera . Is this another vision ? Not now ! Not tonight ! Gimme the camera ! No . Stop ! Hands up ! - Says who ? - Gastonne Belliveau . Private investigator . I notified the police . You 're not a cop ? No . I used to be . But now I work for myself . That 's my associate , Emile Biron . Your keys ! Enough bullshit ! He has a gun . Give him the camera . C 'mon , Biron ! We worked on this too long . - Toss it ! - Gastonne , catch ! Pull me up . Pull me up ! Lapointe ! What 's happening ? Hold on , Biron ! Emile ! Dammitall ! Dammitall ! The Master Key Some days are like that Some lives are like that . Who is it ? Lapointe . Listen to this : . " " Emile Biron of the Third Eye Agency , " " even had his mentor with him , former star reporter Louis-Bernard Lapointe , who ... " " Fraud Artist Nabbed I had a gun pointed at me ... The photo I took is on page 3 ... Lapointe dumped me in the river , but he 's the hero ! He 's trying to help us , not upstage you . Who 's Gastonne 's big star ? I 've nothing to wear on our trip . It 's a BB , not a luxury resort . It 's a country inn . But you 'll look great in this . What ? Nothing . No , it 's just weird . A medium died . Important Witness Sought Two seconds . I 'll check on him . Hello . Excuse me ... I know it 's not your specialty , but ... Would you have any ... I 'm looking for ... On the rack over there . For the Children of Our Love Your mail . The old witch I saw in my head yesterday ... She 's wanted for murder . Of Lucinda Garneau ? Yes . So you saw her too ? I don 't like this . I love it . I am so amped ! No ! It looks like I 'm next on the list . What list ? " " Lecture by Charles Foucault . " " It 's not a crime , you know . No . But my husband 's not ... Very romantic ? He 's jealous of these books . Gastonne ? I saw that name once before , in the cemetery on the cliff . Something like , Estelle , beloved mother of Gastonne ... My mother . I 'm sorry . That was long ago . My dad 's grave is there . It is ? Look at this ! Here ... You 're right . Look , " " Charles Foucault , " " authority on ancient mythology , noted lecturer . " " I wanted a book but it isn 't here . What 's up ? There 's a book ... I hear that ... It 's not what you think . Lapointe ... I saw her ! - Who ? - Her ! She was outside your door . The list ... Her list . - What list ? Duck ! Thanks . Did she go ? Emile , let 's go ! I 'll take the alley , you try there . It 's a long story . The newspaper ... Did you want to pay for it ? Y es , of course ... How did you get this ? A real treasure ... You could 've given it to me . No , I 'm sorry . You don 't want it , trust me . Why ? Does it bring bad luck ? To say the least . Whatever . I live alone , I 'm bored , going bankrupt . It can 't get worse . That 's what I thought . But I discovered things can always get worse . I got the book from a witch . When she died , she passed on her powers to me . In short , you have a gift . More like a curse . All my life , whenever I get close to someone , misfortune strikes . In addition , with my " " gift , " " I see misfortune before it hits . Great , huh ? Believe me ? No . But I 'll play along . You 're a mysterious sorcerer and I 'm ... naive and reckless . Where 's your wand ? I 'm sorry , Miss ... Evelyne ... You 're delightful , but I 've got a bad feeling . I 'll give you a feeling ! Please , I want you to know , I loved you . What happened ? I saw ... I 'm sorry . It 'll end badly . I know it . - She 's gone . - Are you free ? Where you going ? FoucauIt 's lecture . It 's started . But ... Who 's Foucault ? Why 's the old lady after him ? Enough , I 'm calling the cops . No , wait . This is big . It 'd be good for the agency . Let 's tail her . - This is close enough . She 's just an old woman . An old woman killer . She 's only a witness . An " " important witness . " " In police lingo , that means a serial killer ! Undeniably , ladies and gentlemen , the legend of the Key of Possibilities transcends all cultures . Indeed , every ancient civilization speaks of a key that gives access to an infinity of virtual universes in which every possible future is lived out . Every society possessed a sacred object that allowed priests , druids and shamans to travel to a parallel world to seek this key . For the Incas , the sacred object was a box engraved with a gold sun . The Chinese of the Ming dynasty venerated an iron star . This is the ebony cross of the Yoruba people . This cross , believed to be lost forever , reappeared briefly in a Dakar market last year . It is said that a powerful witch has taken possession of it . Hurry or we 'll lose her ! Follow her , fine . But from a distance ! I won 't cancel our weekend for this . No way . I 'm not giving up our country inn ! I know why 're hot on a romantic getaway . You do ? To make amends for dragging me to your mom 's grave again . We light a candle for her once a year . Is that so much ? We didn 't mark your birthday , so why her death ? I wanted to celebrate my birthday . We need to spend more time together , reassess , don 't you think ? Reassess what ? Us ... two . Us , the agency ? The two of us . Why ? We 're doing fine , no ? You 're not answering ? I don 't know ... Love , the future ... Is this really the time ? It 's never the time . The future ? I don 't know where I 'll be next week . You won 't be there ? There ? Where ? You mean with you ? But we have the agency . I mean , I love you . Yes . So you say . What should I say , my love ? Emile ! That 's not just some old lady . Lapointe 's behind this . Who is she ? I don 't know . Our fascination with the Key Of Possibilities is understandable . Imagine , having within your grasp , as many universes as there are choices . If , for example , you 're walking down a road and come to a fork , and you go right ... There 's a universe where you go left , one where you go back and so on , for each of us . The Key of Possibilities would provide the means to know what would have happened if ... the Nazis had won the war , or Columbus hadn 't discovered the Americas . And no doubt more importantly , if you 'd had the nerve to confront an enemy or been able to save a dying loved-one . Or , simply , if you 'd had the courage to say I love you , in time . But ... what holds back many a seeker from this quest is that the souls of those who fail are snuffed out forever . Christine ! The witch of Dakar ! I must speak to her ! I must know . No , Charles ! Madame . Remain calm . Step away from the child . Put your hands up . Do you truly think you 've understood everything ? And you ? Ifyou could experience all your possible lives ? No thanks . I know , I screwed 'em all up . Then perhaps you 're ready . Damn , what was that ? Dear guests , the lecture is over . Come , Charles . Professor Foucault ? Biron , detective . Investigating the Garneau death . For several years , I 've studied the world 's best-known shamans . Several have died recently by drowning . Seemingly unrelated news items in the papers but , in my opinion , they were forced to set out in search of the key , but failed . I saw Lucinda Garneau die . I saw my name on a list . You ? You inherited Grande Ourse 's powers ? Not by choice , Miss . Mrs. I 'm Mrs Christine Foucault . Mr Lapointe , if I were you I 'd flee the country . But what 's the point ? She found the others . Did you notify the police ? From Hong Kong to Chicago , no one is less open-minded than a cop . What 's wrong ? It 's her ! Christine , it 's her ! She 's contacting me . Emile ? Biron ? Mr Biron ! Mr La ... Mr Lapointe ! " " You know what I want . " " If you don 't leave at noon tomorrow , your friend is finished . " " It 's the Yoruba ebony cross . It can 't be . Emile ! I 've had it with your nonsense ! At midday or at midnight , the seeker makes his bed with watery sheets . Water allows the soul to pass from reality to a possible world . You will return alive on one condition . The book says , " " He must solve a riddle in stages three . " " He must find a guide , a chasm , " " the bearer of the key . " " He has 1 2 hours to succeed . " " To get the key , he must kill its bearer . " " I can 't take any more . Anything to do with it . Past or future , all I see is crap . No . Do you remember your very first prediction ? Announcing something beautiful ? The only one never realized ? Does Biron know ? We 'd said we didn 't want any but ... I 'll get him . The universe into which you 'll be transported may be similar to ours or very different . Try to contact us . Only Charles can help you . Be brave , Lapointe . Rhodes ... Lapointe ? Do you hear me ? Third Eye Agency aces another case ! Roger 1 0-4 . How 'd it go with the kids ? The kids ? Oh , yeah , fine . Perfect angels . You have two , right ? Two ? - Thanks , Lapointe . What 's that ? I need to talk to you , alone . Can you give me a lift ? Emile , he 's your friend , the breakup 's been hard ... Lapointe stinks ! - Roger . - Lapointe stinks ! I saw images of antiquity , the word " " Rhodes . " " Might mean something . Now only Lapointe can solve the riddle . He has nothing to fear in this world . I 'll be back . The two worlds aren 't so different , but tell me about myself . What ? Just the main events , please . You 're Louis-Bernard Lapointe , born in Port Lacroix 56 years ago . You married , had a son , not by your wife . Worked in TV , wife died . At Grande Ourse , we worked a case together . 5 years later your son died . You inherited powers of divination that ... That destroyed your brain ! Great , thanks . Seems the same . On the other hand , the designers here are ... a disaster ! What do you mean ? Burnt orange and lime green ... Isn 't it common sense ? So you 're just back from a stylish parallel universe , and that thing is supposed to show you a riddle that must be solved in a generous 12 hours ... to reveal the bearer of the Key of Possibilities . Right ? " " A riddle in stages three ... Find a guide , a chasm and the bearer of the key . " " Don 't forget the punch line . " " To get the key , he must kill its bearer . " " Why not ? Just keep in mind that we 're not in the real world but a virtual one , an imaginable , possible world . If I kill someone here , no one real dies . - Reassuring . - If I 'm wrong , though ... I mean , do I seem virtual ? Come on . You , I don 't know . Your jacket , absolutely . What 's this ? What is this ? Look , I have 12 hours . I 've wasted two . Humor me till midnight . For the Children of Our Love Hi , Emile ? I 'm trying my best to find you . If you can get to your phone ... And also ... I recently discovered that ... Emile , I 'm pregnant . It 's yours , of course . I ... That 's all . I want to be with you always . Do you understand ? " " Neptune . " " I 'm meeting Foucault in two hours . If I had the key , would you whack me ? So ... the first stage of the riddle is supposed to take me to my guide . Someone in this universe who 'll help me solve the others . Rhodes ... R h o d e s ... Does Rhodes bring anything to mind ? There 's an island by that name , the Colossus and ... Wait a sec . In Greek myth , Rhodes was the daughter of Poseidon . The images I saw were Roman , not Greek . But Poseidon 's daughter ... There 's Rhode Island . What did the Romans call Poseidon ? God of the sea ... Neptune . Neptune ! The daughter of Neptune ! Oh no ! Because Neptune 's daughter ... can only be her . Evelyne ! Stop it , Lapointe ! Know her ? Right , you wouldn 't know , you 're from another universe . Evelyne 's your ex . You 've moped for two weeks now cause she dumped you . And this is ... the dumbest strategy to win back a woman I 've ever seen . So I loved her . Why did she leave me ? Many reasons , mostly because you had too many secrets . She didn 't know about ... You wouldn 't tell her . Seems I 've changed my mind . Let 's go ! Neptune 's daughter ... Sweetie , daycare this afternoon . Hi , Evelyne . What 's he want now ? I know , they 're so repetitious . To complain , call Baldaquin Books . It 's not that . It 's your store 's name . Why Neptune ? Why not ? I don 't know . You seemed to know your neighbor , Louis-Bernard Lapointe . - What 's this about ? You a detective ? Yes . But this is personal business . Lapointe 's a friend . He 's in danger and you can help me . Well ... I hardly know him . But ... yesterday we were together here , and it was ... Magical ? Exactly . He said he had a bad feeling . For a reason . He 's loved three people in his life . His wife , his son and another woman later on . All three died before his eyes . Because of him ? No , but he probably thinks so . And also , there 's this . You disappoint me , Biron ! I never said I believed him . Then why are you here ? Evelyne , please . Play along until tonight , then I 'll leave you alone . In your universe , were we a couple ? No . Did we know each other ? By sight . - You 're crazy ! - Enough of this , let 's go . Ok , I 'll follow . Not follow , you have to guide me . Real good start . Hello ? I 'll follow you . If FoucauIt 's not there , I 'll guide you good . Fine , I 'll come get you and ... Well , just wait . How 're things ? Not too bad , why ? Don 't know , I had a weird premonition . Like a deja vu , but something I 'd never seen . I 'm worried about you . I don 't know why . Foucault ! She 's lost her shoe . Come here . That 's Roger 's snack ! For his visit to the zoo . The bus just left . I want the zoo ! I know , Roger . You 'll see Mr Lion another day . Shouldn 't we have given Foucault my cell number ? I don 't want you involved . You guys may be virtual , but you 're growing on me . Ok , I 've had it . No , stay . Look ... I wanted to show Foucault , but too bad . Biron , come here ! If I 'm right and you 're my guide , we 'll see stage two of the riddle . Hold hands . Hold hands , please ! Wait . Wait , this 'll work . 2,8,5 3,5,6,2,1,6,1,4 1,2,8,5,3,5,6,2,1 6,1,4,1,2,8,5,3,5,6 Clock , clock , bridge , cross , clock , bridge cross , 2,1 6,1,4,1,2,8,5,3,5,6 Clock , bridge , cross . clock , bridge , cross . Bridge , cross . Clock , bridge , cross . Help , help ! . You alright ? Do you believe me now ? Will you try to help me now ? With him , never a dull moment . Sure . Stay there , ok ? Just a sec . The numbers ? Dad , why was the lady crying ? I dunno , maybe she felt bad . Why ? Because ... She was crying because ... We 're trying to find out . Go look after Hortense . Could be a navigation code . At sea you chart three fixed points to find your position . There 're too many numbers . And what clock , what bridge ? You know navigation ? I own a boat , remember . - You own a boat ? - Roger ? Roger ran off . Look over there . Sorry . So what does our future look like ? In this universe ? No idea . And in yours ? Just crap ! There he is ! Little scamp . Roger ! You scared me . It 's time for the happy family to go home . Lapointe is right . You go with him . Clock , bridge , cross ! Find something ? Like I said , they 're for finding position . Look , there 's the clock . And the bridge . Cross ! There 's North . The clock 's at 214 , 21 5,216 degrees . The bridge is at 141 , and the cross is at 260 , 285 ... So it 's ... Right here ! And the other number ? 356 . It might be ... wait ! Ok , turn it . A bit more . 356 degrees . It 's that way . Biron , let 's go . " " Crossing the Styx " " Why 's the old woman crying ? She wants to cross ! To reach the boy . The Styx ... isn 't it an underground river ? To the underworld . When the city was built , the main sewage canals were constructed in an old river bed . So that 's it . A 3-stage riddle . Find a guide ... Evelyne . A chasm ... then the bearer of the key . - Not in the sewers ! - I 've a boat , everything we need . Perfect . Let 's go . Call Foucault . Tell him we 'll go up the big canal to the main entrance . Send him an email too . I guess I 'll ... hop aboard your boat for the first time again . Why not ? I 've climbed aboard yours again umpteen times . Do we know each other ? Yeah , maybe . No , I don 't think so . Sorry . Do you or don 't you know her ? I knew her , briefly . - Is he dead ? - No . In a trance . You 're kidding . No , I swear . He has mostly past and future visions but ... if he wanted he could see farther . Please , you have to help me . Lapointe could do great things , but he rejects his powers like a cancer . Call Gastonne ! Call Gastonne ! Call Gastonne . Weak battery Shit ! Hello ? Gastonne , listen ! Where are you ? I dunno . The Foucaults kidnapped me . Charles and Christine Foucault . Come find me ! Emile ? Come find me , Gastonne . Come find me . Come on , I 'll explain . You 're so handsome . I just discovered your lodger . I didn 't hide him . Not this one . How could you lie to me like that ? Lucinda and the others ... You did the same to them ? Everyone , even great mediums , would risk it all for someone . It 's a question of who . You 've completely lost your mind . You can 't abuse your powers this way . A man must freely choose to look for the key . Such a quest can 't be imposed . But everything 's possible . And they all chose freely . I don 't understand . What do you want ? To know everything that might have been ? And that is not . I love you . You 're so very unhappy . I want to see you walking . It 's too late . Much too late . It isn 't . There is a world where you are not ... There is a world ... A world where you are you , where you are whole . What if it were true ? It 's a legend , my love . You mean Biron and Lapointe , right ? They 're crackpots . Or students pulling a prank . You will walk , Charles . You 'll carry me in your arms . Christine , this is madness . I feel a little peaked , my love . Do you mind if I stay home ? You never liked the Sullivans . I 'll make up an excuse . " " A big canal ... Main entrance . " " The greatest mediums have lost their lives ... Your powers , in comparison , are puny . I know . Lapointe is our last chance . Christine ! - Do you know me ? - Y es . Then it is true . I had a vision , where my husband was very ill . You promised me you 'd never leave . I promised you here . Not elsewhere . And it 's elsewhere I 'm going . You 'll walk , Charles . You 'll carry me in your arms . So much effort , all to end up in hell . Really great ! The Greek underworld wasn 't about the devil , but the dead . Very reassuring . What was that ? From here on ... I must go on my own . Louis ! Head that way . You 'll come out by the water tower . Go on . Louis , is something wrong ? Marie ! Look , Dad . He has your eyes . Give me the key ! I want it ! Give me the key ! I want it ! I want it ! Give me the key . The bearer of the key can only be revealed there , where the moon shines on the dead . Help me , please . Go home , Mr Biron . Leave us . Mr Foucault ! Foucault ! Tell me how to bring back Lapointe . It 's too late . Christine made her choice - to live with me as I was and can never be here . So she left the real world , to steal the key from Lapointe there . To be with you in the parallel world . Yes . Gastonne ? Emile ! Ok , I 'm going back down . Christine ? Are you there ? Hello ? Where are you ? Don 't tell me you answered him . Where are you ? I 'll come to you . Wait for me . I 'm coming . He doesn 't have much time left . Give me your hand . You too ? I haven 't your lover 's talent . My gifts are modest but ... I worked very hard to develop them . I want you to know that I , at least , loved you . What do you see ? Great happiness . He 's coming . Lapointe ? This way ! You ok , Louis ? You found the chasm . Ready for what comes next ? The bearer ... There is the possible , Mr Lapointe , but there 's also destiny . We must go where the moon shines on the dead . So if your wife finds the key before Lapointe , he 's toast . And if she doesn 't , it 's she who will die . For me , she 's already lost . Here is the only means I know to help your friend . He must place one 's hand on the same spot at the same time in the two worlds . How do you know where you are ? It takes great power or lots of luck . Fat chance I can do that before midnight . I know where I have to be . Your mother ! The bearer will be where the moon shines on the dead . The cemetery ! The moon shines on the dead . The cemetery on the cliff . Yeah , it 's near here . Gastonne 's even ... - What ? Nothing . Your wife , your son , a dead love affair . Does it make any sense ? I know I was hard on you at the end . I 'm sorry . I probably deserved it . Gastonne ! Louis , stop ! This isn 't the answer . Maybe I 'm not simply your guide . No , it 's Gastonne . What do I do ? What you always do . You sob and ... Is it working ? My love , are you the bearer of the key ? What do you mean ? Lapointe will kill you . The Key of Possibilities , do you have it ? No , no . I 'd love to have the key . With infinite universes ... I 'd find my mother in one . To hell with infinite universes ! We live in this one , Lapointe ! There can 't be an infinite number . Not everything can be possible . Because whichever one we live in , I love you Gastonne , and I 'll always love you . Come , my love . Come . Tell Lapointe Christine wants to steal the key from him . Don 't you touch her ! I must have the key ! Get up , Biron . Louis ! Wait ! It 's not Gastonne . Remember the clues . My dad is buried here . Take a look . Look at my boat . The Styx ! The river in the underworld . Yes , but it 's also the name of a nymph . - Tell Lapointe ... - What ? The three people you saw are the three you most loved in your life . They died before your eyes . The one you most love here ... It 's you ! Tell Lapointe ... Lapointe ! Christine wants to steal the key ! My time 's up ! I need that key . You won 't feel a thing . Christine ! What are you doing ? You can 't understand . It 's to be with you . But I 'm here . Not me . Not yet . Leave me . I want you to know I , at least , loved you . It 'll end badly , I know it . Biron is right after all . The possible isn 't infinite . A world in which I kill you ... it can 't exist . There 's only one destiny . The one that we build with every decision we make . That 's the hidden meaning . The bearer of the key is me ! So that 's it . We are all bearers of our own key . Yes . But to open the door to the infinity of possibilities you must immerse yourself in infinity . You must become pure spirit . You must be ... Dead . Exactly . It 's your key . Take it and in your death you 'll know all that might have been . Refuse it , and you 'll know only one destiny . On the 1 2th stroke , you must choose what you will do . It 's all been decided . I did it ! I killed the bearer ! The key ! If you leave , swear it 's to find me . Yes , yes . I 'm coming . My way of saying how beautiful you are and intelligent and unique . I don 't want to lose you , Gastonne . Emile ! You 're so romantic . You hadn 't noticed ? Before today , no . But ... I have a surprise for you too . Did you check your voice mail ? No , I left my cell at FoucauIt 's . What is it ? Wait . Daddy , look at me ! . Roger , Hortense ... Go to sleep now . Roger Biron ? Roger Belliveau-Biron . The Master Key Do we know each other ? No , we don 't . Shit , isn 't she dead ? Which universe did I end up in ? Here ? It 's obvious , no ? This is reality .

 Initiating landing procedure . Everyone on standby . Cabin crew , prepare for landing . Security checks commencing . All personnel in position . Everyone returned from the rest room ? Check . All little tables folded away ? ALL : Check . Seat belts on ? ALL : Check ! Winkers to shut down . Landing gear down . - Requesting landing line . Suggest left-hand traffic pattern , sir , towards that landing light edifice at the end of the street . Applying brakes now . Velocity decreasing . Revs 2,000 and dwindling . Pavement in sight . Landing lights locked . Standby , we 're attempting to stop . Good luck , everybody . Handbrake engaging . Ignition off . Wow , we made a good landing ! Well done , everyone . OK , doors to manual . Check . Disembark in your own time , gentlemen . What sort of godforsaken place is this ? This is worse than Rimmer World . Get out of town , this is brilliant ! This is just like where I grew up , except there 's less burning cars . I 'll find out where Mr Charles is from that information droid . Salutations , fellow droid , sir . I 'm looking for the actor Craig Charles . Can you direct ? Perhaps it 's overheated . Are you usually that red ? I 'm going to place this instrument into your voice unit and I want you to say " aah " . Hi , it 's me . Where are you ? CRAIG CHARLES : ' In the Rovers , kid.Why ? ' - See you in a minute . Seems to be some sort of malfunction , sirs . Good grief ! Vandals have stolen the droid 's entire hard drive and stuffed envelopes through its voice unit . What kind of place is this ? Let 's ask in the shop . Let me do the talking , sir . I 've been studying the dialect . I 'll wait outside , guard Carbug . Earth , man . INHALES DEEPLY Smell those chip butties . Hiya , chuck , pal , love , sir . We 're looking ... I mean , lewk-ing for granny-grabbing , philandering taxi driver Lloyd Mullaney , as played by Craig Charles . Um ... I think he 's in the Rovers , learning his lines . Is this some sort of joke ? The Rovers ? Well , I 'll stand at the bottom of our stairs and eat a barn cake . We were just past that , weren 't we , lads ? MANCUNIAN ACCENT : Aye , we were , weren 't we ? What a load of numpties . Get your keks on , lads , we 're sorted . Quality . Mint . Ta very much , chuck , pal , love , sir . See ya . Ta-ra , pet . Good job , chaps . We were so authentic it was frightening . Oi ! You 'll never guess who I 've just seen . All your mates from Red Dwarf . They 're outside . Serious ? Yeah . They 've just landed in a little spaceship . It was green . Um ... What 's it called ? Listen , mate , don 't mess about . I 've got loads of lines to learn . I 've go a massive scene this afternoon . But I 'm serious . I know what I saw . Even you were there . I was there ? How many have you had ? Well , I 've had a couple , but listen , I 've just seen you . So high , ugly ... It was definitely you . Hi , guys . What are you doing here ? Ah , Mr Charles , sir . My name is Kryten . I am a fictitious character from the television series Red Dwarf and we really need your help . Told you . You 're the only one that can help us , man . I 've heard about these . They 're called flashbacks . Flashbacks ... I know you don 't exist . OK , no need to rub it in ! Just give us the address of whoever created us and we 'll jump into Starbug and be out of here . Starbug ? ! I just told you . They landed outside the Kabin . That is OK ? We 're not going to get a ticket , are we ? You 're not all here . I know you 're not all here . Er , he 's not all here , but the rest of us are . Yeah . You see , sir , we 're from an alternate dimension and we need answers , like , " How many episodes do we have left ? " Um , I know how many episodes you 've got left . How many ? Er , one . It 's called Back To Earth - Part Three . Script due in a couple of days . RUSTLING All we need from you is an address , bud . We 've got to speak to our creator . And I 've got to get back to the Priory . I am so glad I 'm not him . The guy 's a wreck . He pretends to be somebody else all day . That 's no way to make a living . Smeghead . Visitors , sir . I 'm surprised you didn 't find me sooner . It 's not an easy thing to find your creator . And how can he assist you ? We want more life ... smegger ! A series cancellation sequence can 't be revised once it 's established . What about all the loose ends ? Me and Kochanski ? Getting back home ? I grew weary of you . Does this mean this is our last episode , sir ? The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long . Yeah , but the light that burns half as bright burns four times as long . But the light that burns three-quarters as bright burns five-eighths as long as the light that burns a quarter as bright as the light that 's gone out . ( I 'd have needed a calculator for that . ) The point is , gentlemen , you have all burned so very , very brightly and for so very , very long . Just like the red dwarf star itself , nothing lasts forever . Not even ... banks . What about a Kryten spin-off series ? I could be his sidekick . Or a sitcom ! I 'd even do a sitcom . Anything ... Anything to stay alive . What about a show about cats ? That would never work . Look , what you need is me and Kryten thrown back in time , like a new kind of Robin Hood . Each week , he gets captured and is about to be burnt at the stake for witchcraft or just having a stupid head , and each week I - in a different new , brave new way - rescue him ... bravely . All right , it sucks . Fair enough . Your deaths will be magnificent . Sad and beautiful . The shooting script . Let me describe it for you . You try to escape your destiny and run . I give chase . Move out of my way ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Out of my way ! Sad and beautiful . Blade Runner is the film which inspired both your creation and your death . Gentlemen ... .. time to die . Come here ! You 'd kill me ? ! You 're damn right we would . You know how much you 've made me suffer ? The life you created for me , all those cheap laughs . All that stuff about Rachel the inflatable doll . All the jokes about my puncture repair kit . Actually , that bit was funny . Sorry , carry on . Did you ever think how I felt ? Start writing . I save the day . I get a girlfriend who 's gorgeous and crazy about me . And before you even think of it , after we 've bonked each other senseless , she doesn 't turn out to be my long-lost sister . Damn . How did you know I was thinking that ? Because I know how you think . Now write me a happy ending or we 'll take you with us . You can never win . Accept it and die well . If you kill me , you moron , you 'll cease to exist . Haven 't you been following any of this ? Aargh ! I 've been dead for ages , man - just sitting around , getting old and fat . I never thought I had responsibility to anyone . I never thought there was anyone out there who was on my side , who wanted things to work out . We 've got a fan club . They 've even named a TV station after me . I was never alone , I just didn 't realise it . Now I want more life , smegger ! I 've killed him . Well , we shouldn 't exist . All I wanted was a sitcom . THUD ! A sitcom in a biscuit factory - is that really too much to ask ? I killed him . How can I kill him ? That 's not me . I don 't kill people . You killed him because he made you kill him , sir . Kryten , Page 19 . " You killed him , sir , because he made you kill him . " It 's all in here . He lied to us about our deaths on the street . That was just to throw us off . He killed us by getting us to kill him and now we 're gonna die too because there 's no-one to keep us alive . He 's right . In fact , I don 't think I feel too well . Me either . I think I 'm gonna ... Check the end , see what happens ! Oh , yeah . We can write our own end ! Of course ! What 's written happens . We 're free now . Hey , man , I feel like a god ! I feel like I 've got liquid gold coursing through every vein in my body . Hey , we can get out of this . As long as we 've got this , we control the world . We can do whatever we want . I could command my own ship . I could get Kochanski back . I could get some new sponges . How come I didn 't get a line ? I just gave you one there . I knew you 'd be smegged off . I control everything . So the rest of our loaves can be one giant hedonistic wash filfulment . Typos , sorry , guys . You really think you can write your wee out of this ? Hey , witch me , baby just witch me . He controls the world . He can do anything he wants . I could , if I wanted to , do this . Lister , stop ! That 's an order ! Aargh ! This is brilliant ! What 's he doing ? You 've git to hop me stoop him , sir . Hop me stoop him . Ow ! This is absolutely awesome . All right , next step . Happy ending . Back off , sir . There 's no way we can get to him . Whoa , whoa ! I didn 't type that . Or that . Hey , I 'm not typing this , guys . What 's happened ? Maybe it 's not the typewriter that 's controlling our world . Maybe it 's something else . What is it with these damn things ? Why do I keep making them ? Useless . What actually is it , sir ? There 's something inside . Blow . It looks like a squid . Why would I be making squids ? That something else that controls the world , how about it 's our combined subconscious ? Like the time we were ambushed by the Despair Squid ? On that ocean planet . That thing that attacked us years ago . Whoa , whoa ! Hang on a minute . Are you saying the creature in the water tank , the one that inked us , was another Despair Squid ? Cos I don 't feel despair . I feel ... elation , joy . I 've felt great since I got here . In here , I 'm somebody . It 's made me want to live again . Ssh , footsteps ! Do you hear them ? Kochanski ! I can smell her perfume ! I can get her back again - kids , everything I 've ever wanted . But in the real world , sir , you 'll be dying . This isn 't real . It 'll feel real . Not in your heart . I 've got no option , Krytie . This is the only chance I 've got of getting her back again . Miss Kochanski 's not dead , sir . Those kids were right ? ! I-I-I lied to you , sir . She dumped you . I was trying to protect you . She 's out there somewhere . She 's in here somewhere as well . In fact she 's right behind that door . In this world , she loves me . In fact , in this world , she 's gonna love me until the moment I die . She 's not real . Nobody 's perfect . Look , I 'm becoming transparent . I 'm returning to reality . Me too . Sir ! I 've got to stay . What the hell happened there ? I need diagrams and pointy arrows . Best guess , our natural defences fought back . Our previous encounter with the creature must have strengthened our antibodies . Which gave us the option to choose between realities . This one or the one that started when Kremlin Kate showed up . What if monkey boy chooses not to fight this ? Then he won 't be coming out . 'I 've gotta stay . ' It seems you 're undecided about which reality you wish to live in . I 'm mulling it over . Would you mind if I asked you a question ? Shoot . In your dreams , did you kiss me ? Was it good ? I never wanted to wake up . Then don 't . Where are you going ? I have to leave and get you back . The real me ? You 'll never get me . I 'm way out of your league ! I thought that , too , but I was wrong . You were right . Nah , I 'm pretty cool . I don 't take any smeg . And even though I 'm disgusting , sometimes I can be quite brave . You 'll never get me . Yeah ... I will . I mean , explain this - how can me getting everything I 've ever wanted be caused by despair ink ? Analysis of the creature , sir , suggests it 's a female . Male squid , female squid - what 's the difference ? Females can do ten squidy things at once , but not so good at reversing round rocks ? The male defence system is an ink that produces despair . It seems that the female ink causes the opposite . What ? It gives you joy ? That 's like attacking something that retaliates by giving you an Indian head massage or an aromatherapy luxury nail treatment . What kind of crazy defence mechanism is that ? It 's an ingenious one , sir , because it means you stop attacking it . Yeah . And while you 're all happy-clappy , she scarpers , right ? Precisely , sir . How did she get on board ? I kinda brought her . Years ago , from that ocean planet . # I 'm gonna eat you , little fishy # Cos I like little fish . # Then she escaped . I knew you guys would get mad so I didn 't say nothing . Boy , has she grown . So what 's gonna happen to her ? I 'm thinking sushi-time . I 'm thinking we drop her off at the nearest ocean moon - make some happy sea life . What 's gonna happen to everybody in the reality we left - the guys all watching us on TV ? They 'll continue to exist as a consequence of us creating them in our hallucination , sir . It 's quantum mechanics . Every decision that 's made creates a new universe , as do all dreams and hallucinations . It 's multiverse 101 . But those sad suckers will live out the rest of their lives convinced they 're the real ones and we 're characters from a TV show . And if you told them the truth , you know what they 'd probably do ? Laugh . Yeah . They probably would . # It 's cold outside # There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie # Shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun . # Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd

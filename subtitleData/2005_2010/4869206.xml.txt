 From the very beginning , we have wondered how life began . What our purpose is and where we are headed . We have struggled to understand time , matter , the infinite universe , who we are and if we are alone . Great minds have imagined the most wonderful and the most terrifying answers to these questions . We invite you to join us on this great expedition . Almost done . Are there events so impossible to forget that they become too painful to remember ? Forgot to shave this morning . Sorry to hear that , Doctor . Gail ? This is hard , Deanna . Let 's see if I can make it easier . The cancer has metastasized . H.E.R.-2s are through the roof , and treatment prospects are poor . Sorry . It 's not your fault , Charles . Feels like it is somehow . So what do you think , three to four months ? Sure . You 're a better doctor than you are a liar . See you next time . If I can work it in . Come in . I 'm not sure I 'm in the right place . You are . Please sit down . Want some water ? No , I 'm ... Did I have an appointment ? You 're right on time . I pride myself on that ... being punctual . It 's a lost art . I 've always said so . And you are ? Dr. Evans . This is ... a hospital ? May I ask you some questions ? The nurse 's station . They directed me . I 'd like to start with a little game . Game ? What sort of game ? I want you to watch what I 'm doing . Are you going to make that disappear ? What 's under the handkerchief ? Can we place a bet on it ? Not this time . Let 's see . A paperweight ? Wonderful . There . You 're not recording this , are you ? - Would that matter to you ? - I simply want to know . Matter of common courtesy . You 're being dig 'ed . These are cameras , are they not ? You 're very observant . I 'm being observed . We 're both being observed . Do you like it here ? Well , honestly , I haven 't been here long enough to form an opinion . How long have you been here ? Tell me ... what you were doing before you got here . Before I ... I was at work . And where do you work ? I.S.T. worldwide . That 's a technology company . - That 's correct . - Government work ? - Pentagon . - And what do you do there ? I run the company . I suspect you know that . Well , why do you assume I know ? It 's hardly a secret . What we work on ... That 's another matter . Something you can 't discuss . Suffice it to say that we 're an indispensable part of this nation 's defense . Well , I wouldn 't want you to compromise any state secrets . Confidentiality is part of your work , too , Doctor ... Doctor / patient privilege and all that hokum . Excuse me . so your job seems quite important ... Lucrative , too , I guess . That 's a little personal . I could retire before I turn 45 , but I doubt that I will . What about your family ? - What about them ? - Children ? Look , for the life of me , I don 't know what you 're getting at , but for the record , I have been married for 13 years . My wife is named Dorothy . I have 2 children ... Margaret , 12 , and Peter , 7 . We live in a 10,000-square foot colonial . I drive a 2-seater . I 'm a Redskins season ticket holder . I don 't eat quiche , and I loathe pointless small talk . - What 's your name ? - You obviously know my name . I 'm Robert Havelmann . Is there anything else you 'd like to know ? - Lots . - Am I being interrogated ? Is that what 's going on ? What 's under the handkerchief ? How in god 's name should I know ? - How old are you ? - This is absurd . It 's a simple question . I 'm 41 years old . How old are you , dDctor ? What year is this ? - Are you seriously asking - - Year , Mr. Havelmann . It 's 2007 . Maybe you should pop for a desk calendar . So it 's 2007 , and you 're 41 years old . - That 's what I said . - Take a look in the mirror . - What ? - Please . The mirror . My god ! What have you done to me ? What did you do to me ? ! But you agree there 's no significant change . You watched . Did you see any sign of progress ? The old man is losing his patience with us . How does he think I feel ? Maybe we ought to try another tack . I need more time . Thanks . So you still think there 's a chance he 'll remember ? I don 't think he 's forgotten . On some level , he knows . You 'll have a hard time convincing Geslow of that ... - Or me , for that matter . - That 's why I need more time . Just a few more sessions . I know I can break through . You know how much I respect your work ... You think I 've lost my objectivity . Presumes you had it in the first place . Not with Havelmann , anyway . - That 's not even the point . - Then what is the point ? Accountability . The truth . He can 't just keep pretending to disappear into the ether like this . Two number twos , nice and hot . - There you go . Enjoy . - Thanks . So what should I tell Geslow ? Buy me a week . He wants closure on this . Not as much as I do . Deanna , there are so many other people here who need you ... People in pain , people who 've lost hope ... Lives you could be saving . You 're a gifted Doctor , and ... Well , I honestly think you 're throwing away the chance to make a difference . I care about these people . That 's why I 'm doing this . I 'm doing this for them . I need one more week . I am so over vegetable lasagna . Hold on here . Oh ! Behind you ! - Will ! - Gotcha ! Over here ! Gotcha ! No , you got my shirt . That doesn 't even count . No , no , no , no . He got you . He got you . I got you . Oh . Will , be careful . Come on ! Hi , Dad ! Oh ! You got me . That 's because you 're it . Come in . - Hello ? - Mr. Havelmann . They told me down the hall ... Come in . What can I do for you ? I thought we could have a talk . I 'm sorry . Have we met ? Dr. Evans . I was due for a checkup ... annual thing . - Is that why I 'm here ? - You tell me . You 're what kind of doctor , exactly ? A psychiatrist . Then I 'm definitely in the wrong office . I don 't think so . What 's this about ? I think you can answer that , Mr. Havelmann . It 's pierce . It 's that S.O.B. Pierce . Am I right ? Niles ! Not now , Jerry . We 're late already . - I need your support . - Yeah . Always . Tell me I got you in my corner . Yeah , yeah , always . Let 's get to that meeting . I 'm going after Havelmann . I thought we agreed the strategy was to let him self-destruct . We can 't wait for that . I don 't think it 'll be long . The man 's a ticking bomb . He 's a lot smarter than you think . You give him way too much credit . He canned Seidman this morning . He smells rebellion in the ranks . He 's dangerous to us ... to this company . We have to move now . We wait till we go public , He consolidates his power . You take your shot , Jerry . I will not be joing you in this suicide expedition . - Niles ... - Say what you like about Roberts . He has friends in high places . We all have friends in high places . Happy hunting . I need to know if I can count on you to help me take this son of a bitch down . Jerry pierce was my right-hand man until he made a very serious miscalculation . - What happened ? - He went off the reservation . Let 's call it an aborted coup . - But you stopped him . - I fired him , yes . But I don 't know if that stopped him . - Because ? - Because I 'm here , aren 't I ? Somebody is still gathering information against me . Do I detect a little note of paranoia ? You don 't know the corporate world very well , do you , Doctor ? - No , suppose I don 't . - It 's not going to work . I built I.S.T. I have a game plan . I 'm not about to see it derailed . You believe strongly in maintaining your objectives . That 's what it 's all about . You chart a course , and then you stick to it . No ... self-doubt ? As a leader , first thing you learn ... Inconsistency invites disrespect . Respect . That 's important to you . Respect , honor , loyalty , old-fashioned values ... All in painfully short supply these days , I 'm afraid . How would you describe your values ? The fundamentals ... God , the family , Constitution , - doing what 's right . - What 's right . It 's not a dirty word , Doctor . No . No . If we ent a little more time protecting the fundamentals , we wouldn 't be as vulnerable to our enemies . Sounds like a man ripe for politics . Don 't laugh . I 've thought about throwing my hat in the ring ... State legislature . Of course , there 's a little empire-building to take care of first . You 're an ambitious man . Is that fair to say ? I only want what 's due me . I think we both want that . - I 'm sorry ? - Let 's just drop the charade , Mr. Havelmann . It 's really getting old . You make it sound as if we 've met before . Imagine that . Look , whatever this is about , we 've got ten minutes to conclude it . I 'm due at my daughter 's school at 11 : 00 . She 's in a play , and I promised dorothy I wouldn 't miss it . Promises like that ... they mean a lot to you ? If you had children , you 'd understand . If I had children ? I had two children , Mr. Havelmann ... A boy and a girl , just like you . Only I don 't have them anymore , because somebody killed them . You killed them . You killed my babies ! We ran Havelmann through the synaptical scanner . That 's digned to detect brain abnormalities , am I right ? For the most part , yes . But I had them adapt the program in a way I believe amounts to a very sophisticated lie detector . And let me guess . This proves that he 's lying . No , not definitively , - but it does prove that there 's ... - But what ? What ? Deanna ... You 've been banging your head against the same wall for a year . Don 't you see what he 's doing ? He 's hiding . He 's cocooned himself into a dream world . I don 't know what 's crazier , him taking refuge inside his head - or you thinking that this matters . - But there are moments . It 's almost like he 's reaching out , as if he senses a whole different reality . Oh , come on . You just have to talk to him . He 's lost his mind . It 's not as if he hasn 't already paid the price . He has to be held accountable . He can 't just get off scot-free . You have until the end of the week . Then we put this thing to rest . It 's wednesday . That 's only 2 more days . Warren , if I push him too hard , we might never get him back . Deanna , we have to move on . We can 't afford to endlessly tie up ouresources on Havelmann . You know the difference between us ? You 've given up . I haven 't . I haven 't . My , uh ... My colleagues ... think they have a possible diagnosis of your condition . My condition ? I wasn 't aware I had a condition . They think you exhibit symptoms remarkably similar to Korsakoff 's syndrome . You ever heard of that before ? No doubt there was an " Oprah " devoted to it . Korsakoff 's syndrome is a rare form of memory loss . There was a famous case back in the 1970s . A marine sergeant by the name of Arthur Briggs ... He was in his late 50s , good health , generally . But somehow he lost his memory of any event which occurred to him after September 1944 . I don 't know what this has to do with me . I remember everything that happened to me right up until the time I walked into this room . And that 's precisely what Briggs told his doctors . And to prove it , he told them that world war ii was going strong , that his unit was being deployed to the Philippines , - and that he was 20 years old . - Fascinating . Couldn 't rember anything that happened to him for longer than 40 minutes . He was permanently stuck in 1944 . Very distressing , no doubt . Now can weet on with it ? Where 's the questionnaire ? What questionnaire ? That 's why I 'm here , isn 't it ? To answer questions like , do I sometimes feel as if there were a tight band around my head ? And do I agree with the statement that these days I don 't believe we have much to hope for ? - Oh . Do you ? - Do I what ? Believe we have much to hope for ? I 'm not going to be forced from my position by a handful of young turks who don 't know cutting-edge from cutting farts . Your colleagues didn 't send you here . Then who did ? I envy you , Mr. Havelmann . - You don 't even know me . - You never have to grow old . You never have to watch your friends die . You can still enjoy the music you love , the pleasures of a good meal , good sex . - You 'll always be 41 years old . - Not in 4 months , I won 't . You can create misery , but you don 't have to feel it . You made a clean escape . I don 't have to put up with this . You don 't have to put up with any of it . That 's what 's remarkable about your deception . You are blissfully insulated from who you are , from what you 've done , or maybe , just maybe , it 's just what you want us to believe . Go to hell . What was the weather like this morning ? Do I really need to tell you ? It was a glorious spring morning . 68 degrees . Red buds on the trees . - Is that so ? - Good day . Take a look out the window before you go . That 's not possible . I 've been very careful with you up to now . But that wall between you and your memory is coming down . There 's nothing wrong with my memory . No , nothing , except that little ellipsis ... the 24 years that are missing . To ... this morning . I don 't remember discussing this morning . That 's ... of course . We 're beyond our window . Your attention span , it 's shorter than sergeant Briggs ' . Who 's sergeant Briggs ? Never mind . This morning . Tell me about this morning . I got up at 6 : 30 , just like every morning . Dorothy made me breakfast ... oatmeal , one slice of ham . I kissed the children . I picked up my briefcase . You were going to the office ? Of course . Where else would I ... But you wound up here ... at the ... hospital . All right , I did . How did you get here ? If you know the damn answer , then tell me . The answer is you were already here . That 's absurd . What do you remember before walking into this room ? There was a nurses ' station . I got directions . There 's no nurses ' station . I 'm quite certain . I ... There is ... no ... nurses ' station . All right , I ... I could be wrong about that . Maybe we 're finally making some headway . I 'm glad you see it . The technology your company supplies to the government ... You don 't like talking about that . I 'm forbidden from discussing the details of our proprietary patents . Okay , well , you have my permission . Really . All right . We managed a breakthrough in impulse beam weaponry . Satellite delivery , intelligent targeting . - Intelligent targeting ? - That 's right . Ah , I bet that 's winning you some points on the hill . It never hurts to have the support of those who control the purse strings . Actually , you might be happy to know that you sold your interest in the company for nearly a billion dollars in 2009 . Is that so ? You cashed in your political chits as well ... to run for a seat in the maryland state legislature . Maybe you could tell me who to bet on in the world series in 2010 . Oh , 2010 ? If I 'm not mistaken , it 's the braves in six . You are a deeply disturbed woman . You have no idea . So how does the fairy tale end , Mother Goose ? - Get your hands up . - That 's my wrap . - Did you wash these ? - I don 't want that . What ? You told me you wanted a ... No ! Not mine . - Did you wash these hands ? - Look , look , look . - Now he took mine . - Easy . Why does he get chicken ? Sir . Major , we 're at defcon one . - Defcon one ? - You 've been ordered to the bunker . I 'm gonna decline . It 's not about saving you , Major . It 's not your call one way or the other . We 're not launching ? It hasn 't come to that ? You 'll be briefed at the appropriate time . Now get in the vehicle . well , I 'm not going alone . I 'm gonna take my family ... My children , my husband . We just need an hour . You don 't have an hour , and even if you did , there 's no provision for you bringing anyone . Now please get in the vehicle . discussion is over . - Mom ? Mom ! - Deanna ! That 's how it started ... An international crisis . Not the first , certainly , but it was the last . If you have a shred of decency in you , Dr. Evans ... It 's Major Evans . I work for the NSA . Whoever you are , I just want to go home . Is that asking too much ? You don 't have a home . None of us do . Our homes are gone . Our families are gone . Anything that ever mattered to us ... is gone . You 're talking in circles . I - I don 't know where we are anymore . Well , then I 'll tell you ... We 're stuck here , 1,000 meters under a hillside in Virginia . That doesn 't make any sense . I don 't care what year you say it is . You just showed me the view out of that window . It 's quite obvious . We 're not underground ! It 's not a real window . It 's a projection , a digital display . Then you admit , you have been playing with my mind ! We 're not underground ! It 's not winter ! Oh , it 's winter , all right ... Nuclearwinter . That was a view from a robotic camera 3,000 feet above us . Welcome to the apocalypse , Mr. Havelmann . I am going to see my daughter 's play . I am going to see my family now . And I 'm going to report you as unconscionably abusive to your patients . Your family is dead , Mr. Havelmann . That is a horrible thing to say ! Not as horrible as the way they died . This has gone far enough . You 're a lunatic . I just saw my wife less than two hours ago ! And so you 've been telling me for ten months . Game 's over , Havelmann . You never showed any pity . Why should you get any ? You 're not a doctor at all , are you ? Deanna , what the hell are you doing ? Deanna , put the gun down . Deanna , please , just put it ... Nobody 's gonna save you now . Nobody . - Now where were we ? - Somebody help me ! You will remember , Mr. Havelmann , or you 'll die trying . I had a feeling something like this might happen . - What you gonna do ? - Find a way to that room and stop her . - What do you expect me to do ? - There is an alternative . What are you talking about ? You could let things take their course . Maybe she isn 't the only one who 's cracked under the pressure . Justice would be served , one way or the other . The justice of naked revenge ? Is there another kind left ? I don 't believe you . Not a single thing you 've said . Then I suppose that puts us on equal footing , except that I can prove that what I 'm saying is true . Fine . Then by all means , prove it . - Just put down the ... - Get back ! That 's New York . Former population , 11.3 million . No survivors . That 's Tokyo . Sao Paulo . Beijing . And that 's London ... Eight hours after the bombs hit . The first few weeks , we had reports of pockets of survivors in Central America , North Africa , Australia . But we lost contact with them . As of now , we 're not sure if there 's any more than 871 people alive , all inside this bunker . You 're asking me to believe that I left home this morning , kissed my wife and kids and then stepped through some kind of time tunnel into a post-nuclear holocaust ? You 're not listening to me , Mr. Havelmann . You never really did hear me , did you ? You couldn 't even hear your own experts when it might have made a difference . We have a potential problem with the I.B.-8 , sir . What sort of problem ? It may be more ... More powerful than we intended it to be . We 're designing the weapons system of the future , Nate . The more powerful , the better . Or am I missing something here ? Group 5 ran the beta through 10,000 sims . Every possible scenario , including the targeting of nuclear sites , missiles , power plants . And ? We think the beam could unintentionally trigger all fissionable material within a radius of 60 miles . You think , or you know ? We 're not certain , but given the danger ... - Of course . - The potential ... I - I mean , if we don 't solve this ... I 'll read this immediately . Mansur blew the whistle , didn 't he ? You had ample warnings . You just wouldn 't heed them . There was a timetable in place . A timetable . Do you think the competion calls a time-out ? - So you ignored the warnings ? - Of course not . We tweaked the design . We built in safeguards , but we didn 't veer off course . Right and now you 're looking at the result . You 're showing me a simulation to manipulate - It 's not a simulation . - There 's a sea of corpses - - How stupid do you think I am , Major ? You 're not stupid . No one ever suggested you 're stupid . There 've always been people like you , Major ... People who don 't understand that progress is our birthright , that the greatest danger is ... that we shackle our genius as a people . If it had been up to you , you would 've outlawed electricity , the automobile , the personal computer . Oh , maybe I would 've . There . You 've proved my point . One day , it 's the greenhouse effect , and then the next day , we 're poisoning the oceans . You live in a world of paralyzing fears and irrational paranoia . If we surrender to that fear , we might as well be back in the cave . We are back in the cave . I 'll give you points for cleverness , Major . You really had me going there . So what are you going to do , Mr. Havelmann ? Are you going to walk out into the crisp , blue sunshine and congratulate yourself for making the world safe for democracy ? I think I 've earned a certain measure of contentment . Well , it pains me to disappoint you , but you 're not going to walk out of here . By my watch , you have less than ten minutes before you cycle back to square one , before you tell me we 've never met before . Oh , I hardly think I could forget you , Major Evans . You know , maybe I should put a hole through your brain right now . The threat alone could end your career . If I picked up the phone right now , you 'd be toast . Really ? Who would you call ? I think it 's fair to say I 've accrued some friends you would not want to tangle with ... Frankly , some of the most important people in washington . Mr. Havelmann , you are the most important person in Washington . I 've made my contributions , certainly , but there are a couple of hundred movers and shakers who might take issue with your assessment , not to mention the man in the oval office . Mr. Geslow took over shortly after we arrived due to your diminished capacities , but he was never sworn in . You were , and still are , President of the United States . It 's designed to be impervious to attack . It 's the President 's safe room in case the facility is breached . There 's no way we can bust in there ? Not without the kind of firepower that would put the whole facility at risk . There 's got to be something we can do . There are 4 inches of case-hardened steel . - So ? - We could use plasma torches . - It could take some time . - Do it . We 're in the President 's office at the strategic emergency command bunker . You should 've made things a little more spartan if you wanted me to believe that . The appointments are all yours , Mr. President . Lavish , self-indulgent , personalized . If I 'm the president what does that make you , the secretary of assassination ? I was your psychiatrist . You shared the most intimate details of your life with me . And I cared about you , sir . You know what 's crazy ? Part of me , even after all you 've done , part of me still does . I ordered a retaliatory strike , is that it ? It was a preemptive strike . You went against the advice of virtually all your advisors , including ... your Vice President . You attacked with I.B 's ... First time they 'd ever been used . The one-minute war , you called it . The I.B. is a deterrent . Who would 've ... What are you saying happened ? You wound up triggering nuclear explosions from the Caspian sea to the Persian gulf . Six countries answered in kind . And then ... Well ... all hell broke loose . Why are you doing this , Major ? Is it possible you 're actually a patient in this hospital ? More pictures . I told you your family didn 't make it . They were at the western white house at the time . You had the arrogance to think they wouldn 't be in danger . What the hell is this ? You had a robotic camera deployed before the Korsakoff tightened its grip on you . What kind of sick joke is this ? You watched this footage . I was in the room when you did . You cried like a baby . That 's Dorothy 's ring . Who gave you this ? The remote found an inscription . It also confirmed her D.N.A. Do I need to show you the children ? Oh , god . Is it coming back now ? What do you remember , Mr. President ? - I have to know . - All of it ! All of it ! Do you remember ordering the strikes ? I believed in what I was doing ! Protect the country , protect our way of life , protect the democracy . I had a duty ... A sworn obligation . Of course , there 'd be consequences ! You can 't succumb to emotion ! Reports ... Three million dead ... 40 million ... A billion ... Numbers ... Incomprehensible numbers ... I considered the options . I thought things through . I ... didn 't back down . I believed in what I was doing ! The democracy , the nation you protected ... It prevailed . It 's 871 strong . Mission accomplished , Mr. President . There was reason , Robert ... A reason for what must seem like my unspeakable cruelty . The people will survive . The world will start again . And they will look back to this moment and they 'll be reminded that none of us can surrender our individual responsibility . Not those who lead , not those who follow . It 's all we have , sir . It 's all we 'll ever have . We still have audio , but we lost picture . It 's time now . I wish there was another way . Please . Good-bye , Mr. President . Deanna ... You can 't do this . Come in . Hello . Is this where I 'm supposed to be ? Yes . Please sit down . I hope this doesn 't take long . I 've got to be at my daughter 's school at 11 : 00 . My wife will kill me if I 'm late . When the fate of so many rests in the hands of so few , can the failure to be accountable ever be forgiven ?

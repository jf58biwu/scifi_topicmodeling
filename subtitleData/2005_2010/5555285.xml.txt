 We believe that this particular lot of libido inhibitors is contaminated . Think we sold them on the halos ? Paula can 't pilot that lander . Beta chose Paula . It didn 't injure her thumb . My thumb ! If she 's not the one , it 'll let us know . - What ? - Paula failed . Like Job , I feel I am being tested , you see . As if Satan himself were on this ship . Rollie , there is a thing on board with us , OK , a thing that you knew about and just forgot to mention to me . So while this is thoughtful and sweet , it doesn 't make that right . When we got married , we made a rule . We could get angry , fight , slam doors , sulk . In three hours ' time , we would come back and discuss it . Well , what do we do after three hours up here , Rollie ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Hey ! I get to make a call ! Like most kids , I used to play hide-and-seek in my neighbourhood . Best place to hide was an old oak barrel behind the Sutters ' garage . I used to climb in and pretend I was John Glenn orbiting the earth in Freedom 7 . And I never got found . But I did discover that after about an hour or so , an old oak barrel can get pretty cramped and lonely ... just like the life of an astronaut . So ... Rollie didn 't call me , and I didn 't call him . And I think make-up sex is probably a long shot . I guess that 's what happens when the three-hour rule passes up here . Nothin ' . Sorry . All right , guys , so , er , form 24 today . We are ... T minus 23 hours until the Venus landing and Zoe 's walk . What . Not doing my job isn 't gonna make this thing go away . Zoe , you 're under orders to rest . Well , it 's just a 20-minute walk . In 460-degree weather . You need to conserve energy today . Fine . Donner , mission control wants you to run the landing simulation . Everyone else , T-1 standard . Why can 't we just say " business as usual " ? Because we 're astronauts . Oh ! Good morning , sunshine . Morning , Steven . I 'm OK . I 'm sorry . I ... I got a little overwhelmed yesterday . But I 'm OK . Good . Now that we 're all OK , let 's get going . Oh , if you need help running the sims and the lander , I 've been helping Paula all week . I 've spent some time in landers , too . I think I can manage . You rest . Ted ! I would love to do my space classroom on the Venus suit today . Any objections ? I don 't , but mission control does . You 've been ordered to have a psych eval with our good doctor . How are they doing ? 'They 're rattled , Eve . ' Yeah , we trained hard , but not for this . You did . You just didn 't know it at the time . So you are going to make history tomorrow . We made history on Mars , too . Ted , we are doing it right this time around . What if we 're not ? If we 're not ... If we 're not , then I was wrong . And we have wasted billions of dollars , 15 years ... And lives , Eve . Lives . Walker and Sharon ... And Zoe , Donner ? Ted , that is not going to happen . We 're gonna be OK . I developed the halos that they sell at Merkmancinco , 20 years ago . We have never , in clinical trials or active use , ever had hallucinations caused by the halos . well , maybe one batch went wrong , and ISO got it . No , there 's thousands of halos in a batch . We sell the things to prisons , to priests . So the press release from ISO ... Is a lie . It 's a total fabrication . But you 'll have to get somebody from ISO to corroborate that . Why do you care ? It 's my retirement . And it 's my grandkids ' college fund . And i get 1 % of all sales . Kim , where 's Goss ? No idea . You 're lucky that the cop that picked you up washed out as an ASCAN back in ' 43 , because he called me . Your blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit , Rollie . Is she OK ? If that girl dies , you 're looking at vehicular manslaughter . That 's 25 years . No parole . Mike , just tell me . Is the girl OK or not ? She 's in a coma . But holding on . Oh , God . What the hell have I done ? Er , I-I , er , I have to talk to Jen . No , you don 't . You are not calling Jen . In fact , Jen is not gonna hear anything about this . And you are gonna sit there silently while I figure something out . 'You 12 get the first shift for sensory deprivation training . This is how we find out who can handle the pressure of being alone in space and who can 't . What happened to " there is no I in team " ? This is how it works . You 're in the tank until we pull you out . It could be a half-hour . It could be two days . You can expect periodic noises . We don 't want anyone napping . Why is he looking at me ? I feel like he was looking at me when he said that . Listen up . This is a requirement , people . No-one goes any further in the programme until the exercise is complete . Is that clear ? We 'll start in ten . Dude , this is it , man . This is totally it ! What are you talking about ? Man , one of the old Als told me that after Sensdep training , everybody gets laid . Yeah , man , it 's something about being alone and then needing ... to-to not ... be alone ? That doesn 't sound like it 's particularly scientific . Doesn 't need to be . It 's not . Don 't crush my dreams , doc . Guaranteed sex tonight . Guaranteed sex tonight ! Don 't leave me hanging . There ya go ! Hey , Mamacita . So , er , this sensory deprivation thing ... Handsome , vulnerable , kind of broken . You targeting Mintz to help you blow off a little steam later ? Don 't be ridiculous . I 'm gonna be sleeping alone in my own little bed tonight . Amen to that . Said the bitter space nun . What ? Me , bitter ? Come on ! Not even a word of support ? What is wrong ? Nothing . I 'm fine . Really . Come on , this is gonna be like spending the afternoon in a jacuzzi . Yeah , except jacuzzis are in open air with other people and with delicious beverages with tiny umbrellas . OK , then once we get through this , we will go to Major Tom 's , and we will consume delicious beverages with tiny umbrellas in them . Deal ? Deal . Wass , tank one . Wesson , two . Schilling , three . Barnes , four . I hear tonight can 't help but be hot . Can you do me ? I 'm sorry ? Zipper . Are we still on ? Uh , for tonight ? Yeah , I 'll see you at Tom 's . Great . So I 've got , er , room to spare in mine , ladies , if anybody gets lonely , wants to chat . No ? This is where I 'm at , if you 're curious . Jen ? Oh . Yeah . Good to go . Get me out ! Somebody get me out ! Let me out ! Easy , easy , easy , easy . Easy . Thank you . For the record , I didn 't last five minutes my first time . But it is a requirement . You have to pass . Well then I guess I 'm out . Jen , i promise you , if this is the reason why you burn out of the programme , you will never forgive yourself . You know what to expect now . You can push yourself through it . You-you don 't un ... you don 't understand . Look , I will get you into a later group . You can at least try it again . Yeah . Sure . Whatever . This is exactly what we need , so as soon as you get it , let me know . Hey . All right , thanks . They didn 't keep you in there very long . What happened ? Your place . Right now . Will you marry me ? Uh-huh . 30 metres . 20 metres . 10 metres . Stand by . Touchdown . Landing secured , even with the musical accompaniment . Hey . Sure you don 't need any help ? You 're supposed to be resting . Oh . Well , you know , talking to you isn 't exactly taxing . You 're supposed to be completely off your feet , OK ? It 's a caloric burn thing . It 's like prepping for a marathon . Why don 't you go watch a movie ? No , I 'd rather not . Well , read a book . I 've read them all . Practise your first line . What ? Your line . You know , what you 're gonna say . The first woman on Venus - I hope you have a line . Right ? Yeah . I hope it 's better than Walker 's " Red planet conquered , " the warrior brought to his knees . " Yeah . Of course it is . OK . How 's he doing ? Perfectly . We 've run three different simulations three times each , and he 's nailed it every time . Can we wrap this up , Donner ? Let 's have one more time through . I want 549-B . It 's the last one , I promise . 549-B . Wind gusting at 15 kilometers per hour . OK . Storm system moving in from the east . And ... I 'm in . Watch your pitch . I got side winds coming in . Hang on . I 'm gonna power through this . 30 metres . 20 meters . 10 . All right , going again . I have nothing to say . I find that hard to believe . No . I 'm going down to Venus tomorrow , and , er , they 're gonna record whatever I say when I get there in the annals of history forever . And , er , ahem , I 've got nothing . I 'm sure you 'll think of something . " Through difficulties to the stars . " Venus is a planet ? It 's Seneca . It 's a famous Latin quote . Oh , see , I took Mandarin . You know , one of the useful languages . And by the way , aren 't you supposed to be resting ? OK , I am going to Venus tomorrow ... I know . We know . The whole world knows . Are you OK ? I 'm fine . I 'm sorry about before . Eh . Are you still fighting with Rollie ? How did you get " I 'm fighting with Rollie " from " I 'm fine " ? Well , just cos you say you 're fine doesn 't make it true . It 's OK to reach out and ask for help sometimes , Jen . Zoe , I 'm fine . Call Rollie . I 'm leaving . I 'm gonna go . I know I messed up yesterday . I get it . It 's just ... I don 't know what to think about beta . At first , I thought it was God showing me my miracle . But then it kept me from passing my landing test . Why would it do that ? I don 't know . You said that you think it shows us things that we feel guilty about . It 's just a theory . Based on what ? Back in the war , there was a girl trapped inside a building . I tried to save her , and ... didn 't . The scar on your back ? Yeah . And that 's what you 're hallucinating about ? Like I said , it 's just a theory . But I don 't feel guilty about Hector . Hector was my miracle . Your miracle ? Yes . Beta shows me my miracle . Hector 's why I believe . He 's alive ! It 's a miracle . Noise to keep us from napping ? Whatever . I could sleep through World War IV . How was your stint in solitary ? Easy . I saw my miracle , and I knew I wasn 't alone . Hey , er , you wanna be my miracle , baby ? You 're disgusting , Steven . What about you , blondie ? You wanna be my miracle ? I 'm going to suggest that you , er , never say that to anybody ever again . It is both creepy and gross . Oh , yeah . Well , that 's what I was going for . 42 seconds . I mean , I think that must be a new world record for worst performance ever by an ASCAN . No . No . But you do know it is a requirement , and ... You can get cut . So I 've heard . Seriously , you know what you need ? You need ... mind over matter . What the hell are you talking about ? You don 't mind , I don 't matter ! Oh , God , you are such a cheeseball ! It 's dark ... And quiet . It 's not so bad , right ? No . It 's not so bad under here with you . Mmm . My proposal is this - an evening of dangerous games , followed ... by ... Again , creepy and gross . Come on . I 'm sorry . How 'd it go today ? Fine . Wow , you sound like an astronaut . You got the one-word answer , the flat delivery . Now you just gotta work on that drink . You hanging out alone tonight ? No , I 'm not alone . No , we 're here . Together . Really ? Hanging out , yep . Yeah . Yeah , we 're just hanging out , man . You guys are hanging out . Doing what ? We 're playing darts , having some bevvies . You don 't play darts . I love darts . She 's really , really good . Well , let 's go . Come on . No , now ? Now ? Yeah , you love darts . Come on , honey , he can join us . All right . That 's me . I gotta , gotta . Gotta . Hey . Oh . OK . OK . It was Rollie . He got me back in . Bueno . Will you , um , will you come with me ? I mean , it might not be so bad if I know you 're out there . OK . I 'll try . But just let me take a shower first . Sure . You OK ? Yeah . Uh , I go in in half an hour . Schilling . How was it ? Like taking a nice warm bath . So what is the miracle that beta shows you ? Hector used to wait for me by the window to come home from school . That day , I saw Hector by the window , like always . Mama ! ' I walked in , and then somehow , Hector got out . ' Hector ! ' He was dead . I begged God to give him back to me . ' And then he did . God answered my prayers . God sent Hector back to me as a reward for my faith . I don 't care what it costs to bury this . Just make it happen . I 've been looking for you all morning . Their genomes have held steady since that first mutation , but in the last week , they 've mutated again . We 've been over this , doctor . We could be looking at serious medical problems down the line . What 'll happen when they pick up gamma ? We hope for the best . we have to tell them . I need you to go back out there to your station and do your job . I 'm trying to do my job , but you seem hell-bent on making that impossible . Sir . Claire , we have just regained a modicum of equilibrium up there . If I tell the crew that their genes might be changing , what does that gain me ? So ... how was it for you ? I thought it was kind of relaxing , once you got past the weird sensation of not knowing where your body ends and the water begins . Kinda like having a few drinks . Yeah . So I 've already had two glasses of wine , and if I don 't get some food , I 'm liable to get to that place where I make bad choices . Like dancing on the bar bad choices ? It 's really not pretty . So I was wondering if you 'd like to , um ... save me from myself by getting some food with me . I know this Italian place . It 's ... Claire ... I like you ... A lot . Which is why I 'm gonna say no . I 'm not the guy you want to get involved with . Well , why don 't I be the judge of that ? Trust me . # I like it when you get there # Don 't say you need another reason ... # Hey . Hey . You ready ? No . That 's the spirit . Have you , um , have you seen Ted ? No . No , I haven 't . You OK ? Jen , look , you are putting way too much on this . You know , between you and me , it 's kind of a stupid exercise . ISO and the space programme have built-in redundancy . I mean , there are nine ways to solve every problem . You 're never alone . Somebody 's always got your back . Look ... Try this . Six sick slick slim sycamore saplings . I 'm sorry . I don 't even know what to say to that . It 's a tongue twister , and it 's harder than you think . Trust me . You focus on getting that right , and you won 't think about this . And I 'm gonna be here the whole time , OK ? Six sick slick slim sycamore saplings . Six sick slim ... Six ... Come on . Six sick ... Sick ... S - sick ... Sycamore ... Saplings . Six ... Sick slick slim sycamore saplings . Six sick slick slim ... ( Sycamore saplings . ) Six ... Six sick ... Slim slick sycamore saplings . I am talking to a bunny . Good work . OK . 'Hey , Jen . ' Kim ? I - I 'm sorry . What ... ? Isn 't Rollie there ? He ... he should be on shift by now . Yeah , he had to go to Bertran HQ . Last-minute all-day meetings , mission status updates . Do you want me to leave him a message ? Why don 't I just call him ? What , he 's not reachable ? Communication lockdown until he leaves Bertran headquarters . Their rules , not ours . OK . All right . Uh ... Thanks . Damn . Well , that did it . You are officially the worst darts player in the world . You want some tips ? No . Oohh . Bathroom , right now . I don 't even want to wait to get you home . Oh , my God . It 's even better from this angle . Is everything OK ? Everything 's fine . Why wouldn 't it be ? Um , I don 't know . Just checkin ' . Mmm . OK , yeah . The only thing is I 'm sort of in the middle of a game here . How about you let me finish , and I 'll , er , buy you a drink ? What do we need to win ? Double 20 . Mm-hmm . Hmm . I love darts . I thought you got the golden ticket to do nothing all day . It looks like you 're working . I have nothing to say . Then say nothing at all . Oh . Yeah , I hadn 't thought of that . I don 't know . Uh ... Doesn 't have much of a ring to it . What are we talking about ? Venus . I need an opening line . Oh , you should totally be like ... That isn 't dirty . I would ... Or juvenile . We could all ... Or incomprehensible to anyone without five years of post-grad maths . Yeah , I got nothing for ya . Yeah . Why did Donner even say anything to me ? You know , I would 've just gone down there , and something would 've rolled off my tongue . OK , take it up with him then . He 's still in the lander . Still ? 'Simulation failed . ' Run it again . All right , brother . Let 's take a break . Yeah , I 'm not gonna get a break tomorrow , so I don 't know why I 'd take one today . Donner , this is an insanely hard simulation , OK ? You know the only reason it exists is to prove to dumb jock pilots that they can 't land in every condition . OK , this is designed to be impossible . It 's not impossible . I 've done it before . Let 's go ! We would never launch in these conditions , OK ? It would never happen . Come on , let 's take a break . Man , let 's go . Tomorrow , I 'm gonna be down there with Zoe , and you 're gonna be safe and sound up here like Goss was . I 'm not Goss . And this is not Mars . Nadia , let 's run it again . So Hector came back to life because of your prayers ? Yes . OK . How did he get out ? Did you leave the door open when you came in ? No . I walked in , I closed the door and I locked it like always . Well , how did it get open ? Did someone else leave the door open ? God needed for Hector to be on that street , so that I could witness that miracle . He makes all things possible . So Hector goes from lying in the road , dead , to the sidewalk and breathing in your arms ? Yes . And how does he get from the street to the sidewalk ? That 's part of the miracle . Are we done ? Tell me again about the door . You doing OK , Claire ? I 'm fine . If you need to talk to someone ... I don 't need to talk to someone , Eve . Do you realise what we 're doing here ? This is a 10 trillion experiment without a control . I know . What kind of science is that ? There 's so much good could 've been done with that money here on Earth . Instead , we send eight people hurtling across the galaxy with a rock that we have no idea what it 's ... It 's about faith , Claire . And you know I 'm not talking about the religious kind . Now I don 't know where I come down on God , but I have faith in those eight astronauts , and I have faith in Beta . Yes , well , I am a scientist and a doctor , and my only concern is the well-being of that crew . I can 't just take things on faith . And neither should you . I walked in , and then Hector got out . How many times do I have to tell you this ? So you didn 't forget to close the door ? No . Do you remember who else was home ? I can tell you who wasn 't home ... my mother . OK . Tell me about that . I don 't want to talk about this any more . You 're just questioning my faith because you have none of your own . Paula . Paula , we 're not finished here . Yes , we are . You know , you strike me as more of a usually Cabernet , never Chardonnay type of drinker . What ? You just don 't seem like the type for whiskey shots . Are you secretly judging me ? No , no , no . It sounded like judgment . No , I 'm just being ... just being observant . What , did Sensdep training get to you or something ? Sure . Let 's go with that . You know , I read somewhere that the best crew to send up into space would be a group of Buddhist monks . Think about it . You know , they shut off all desire , they meditate all the time and focus on their religion . Maybe I should try that . Mind you , it does sound really bloody boring , doesn 't it ? OK , come here . Come here . I 'm gonna help you . No , I don 't need your help . Yeah , no , you ... you do , if only for the safety of Tommy 's patrons . OK ? That guy was not hurt . Uh-huh . All right . Your left . Put your arm out . Now it 's all about touch . You wanna be solid but relaxed . All right ? Just let the dart fly itself . Solid but relaxed . Take your time . That 's it . Beautiful . Doesn 't get any better than that . Right ? Yeah ! That 's perfect . Thank you . How about you buy me one more drink and then take me home ? OK . Yeah , yeah . That sounds like ... sounds like a plan . Mmm . Uh ... I guess , er , have a good night . OK ? Yeah , you , too . Ciao . All right . ( Solid but relaxed . ) Oh . Thanks . So , er , I guess Ted never showed , huh ? Well , there was a meeting . He probably got pulled into it . Right . Hey , come on ! You did it ! Yay ! Look , why don 't you let me take you out for a drink to celebrate ? Oh , I think I 've been more than enough trouble for one day , Rollie . I should just cut my losses , er , and , um , head home . Thanks . Jen , you are never any trouble . I couldn 't have made it through this without you , Rollie . Thank you . Any time . So this is how this is gonna work . You 're back on the floor starting tomorrow . What ? And this cost ISO a small fortune , so we would really appreciate it if you could just keep this to yourself . As far you 're concerned , as far as I 'm concerned , this never happened . What about the girl ? Did you hear me ? It never happened . This is completely messed up . Is that what you plan to tell her family , Mike ? You gonna tell her that nothing ever happened ? Is that what you 're gonna tell her if she ever wakes up ? I may not have killed her , but she 'll probably never walk again . But nothing ever happened , did it , Mike ? ! Now I 'm supposed to just walk the hell out of here , huh ? Cos nothing ever happened ? Go home and call your wife . She 's been looking for you . Can I help you ? Whoa , whoa . Hey , those are vintage . Hey , hey . Ssh . It 's OK . I ... messed up . Please just hold me . So how 's Paula ? She 's OK on the surface , but there 's something underneath it all - you know , something she 's hiding . Repressing . I think I can help her once I figure it out . You OK ? Yeah . I 'm ... fine . It 's just one of those days . Je t 'aime . I love you , too . Bye . 30 metres . Simulation failed . All right , go on again . End simulation . What are you ... ? You can 't be in here . OK ? You 're throwing me off my game . You 're holding on too tight . What ? It 's all about touch - solid , but relaxed . All right , get outta here . I 'm not going anywhere . 20 metres . 10 metres . Touchdown . All right , Nadia . Let 's call it . I think I 'm good . All good . Isolation is a fact of life in space . I don 't know if there 's any real training for it . There certainly isn 't a cure . Most of the time isolation 's self-imposed . Sorry . I got called into a meeting at mission control . Jen ? ' Sometimes by shutting people out ... ' Jen , don 't . Please don 't . Jen , don 't . Jen ! ' .. sometimes by inviting people in ... ' ' .. and sometimes by hiding alone in the Sutters ' oak barrel . ' 'Sometimes it 's by losing faith in the very things that keep us going . ' # Dream # Chasing # You followed the sun Across mountains and oceans # And cities # And small towns # Stopped in # Someplace # Oh , they 're glad they met you Their hearts are now with you # In joy # And pain # Young and plain # Young and plain ... # What are you doing here ? You were there for me before I left for Antares , so ... I 'm here for you tonight . Er , I think ... I think I 'm OK . Well ... # You 're on your own again ... # I 'm not . I 'm terrified . 'We lean on each other and seek solace 'where we think we 'll find it . 'But sometimes it 's just unavoidable . 'There 's nothing to do but embrace the isolation 'and walk out into the void alone . ' # .. Now I 'm on my own again . #

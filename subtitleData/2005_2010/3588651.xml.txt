I 'm afraid i 'm gonna have to clean it up . - a bit of a mess ? Sounds to me like the claire bennet recruitment Is a lost cause . - well , you know me . I 'm the patron saint of lost causes . - this is a lost cause . - no . there 's got to be something . - there 's nothing . Nothing about becky taylor , Or why she wants me dead . - or why she killed annie . - right . Let 's not forget that she already succeeded In killing one of your roommates . Awesome . - i should go to the sorority house And go into her room , Go through her stuff . I 'll find answers there . - what if you find becky instead ? Or what if she 's here right now ? Wanting to kill me ... Invisibly . - uh ... There are ways to make her visible . Huh ? See ? Nothing . - maybe i should go with you ? - no . No , just stay here . It 'll be safer .

Wow , 4 1 / 2 hours at the airport , Trying to talk your way out of that airport jail , Only to still be on the no-fly list . And now this . - how did i not see that huge chunk of metal In the middle of the road ? - maybe i made it so you didn 't see it . [ metal clangs ] Oh , man , i could get used to this- - Playing the bad guy , the saboteur . - do you have any upper-body strength at all ? - actually , i 'm deceptively strong .

In his death , He has helped me prove a point about the line . - what line ? - the one i can cross and you can 't . The one that says i can do anything i want , Like killing people in cold blood . - no , you can 't just- the world is my hostage , matt . Anybody . Anytime . So no more sabotage , okay ? Because i 'm the one that 's in control here . Do you understand me ? I 'm sorry . I don 't think i heard you . - yes . I understand you . - good . - [ breathing heavily ] Hey . I 'm ... fine . I 'm fine . I can 't ... Too many people need help . This power , it keeps draining out of me , And then it comes back , And then it drains out of me again . - maybe you shouldn 't use it anymore . - and be ordinary ? I got to get back in there . [ exhales ] Thanks . Hey , you know , they could use your help . Earlier i saw you with the , uh , suture . Where 'd you learn how to do that ? - clown college . - clown college . Seriously . - medical school . I dropped out . - you 're packing . Why are you packing ? - because i 'm going home . Maybe forever . - no. no , no , no , no . you can 't do that . I told you that i was gonna handle it . - with what ? baby powder ? That doesn 't exactly inspire confidence . - i know. i know . And that 's why i called my dad . You 're too important ... To me . I just don 't want to lose you . - i 'm sorry . I already booked my flight . - wait , wait , wait . you don 't understand , okay ? This is rene , And he can keep becky from being able to turn invisible . - i 'm scared for my life , okay ? - i know . - do you ? Because becky 's after me . She 's not after you , Because you can 't get hurt . But i can . - gretchen . Gretchen , everything 's gonna be fine . Okay ? my dad and i have done this a thousand times . - exactly ! This is everyday life for you , But it 's not for me . I 'm just not like you . - stay with her , please , Until she gets on the plane . - can i help you ? - possibly . Hopefully . - i apologize for this awkward introduction And my more awkward agenda . My name is samuel , And i 'm here looking for my niece , rebecca . Becky . - and why would i know where your niece is ? - because she told me who you are , claire . At least a little bit . I know you 're special . Like her. like me . I know you 're asking yourself right about now , " who is this guy ? What could he possibly know about me ? " - yeah , something like that . - i also know it 's very hard To trust anyone in this world Being ... one of us . - so why should i trust you ? - you shouldn 't . Not until you hear me out . If you have a moment to listen , I might have some answers for you . [ door closes ] - i had a partner like you once . As i recall , about 10,000 volts of electricity Should make you materialize ... And then some . Don 't want to have to use this . - why do i find that hard to believe ? - just you today ? - i 'm actually hungry enough to eat for two . - if memory serves , The tahitian pancakes here are really good . And a coke . Uh , a diet coke . - oh , i 'd say go for the real thing . Life 's too short for artificial sweeteners . - well , amen to that ... Lynette . Regular coke it is . - yeah . - oh , she 's so sweet . Isn 't lynette so sweet ? Funny story ... I tried to kill a waitress here once . - you can 't kill her . - oh , i 'm sorry . Did you miss my whole " the world is my hostage " bit earlier ? - no , i got it . i got it . I 've done nothing . and i 've kept quiet . - and now i want you to talk . Hostages are used to get things that you want , And i want to know everything- - Exactly how i ended up in your head , And where the hell my body is . - no . - it 's nice and isolated back there . Nobody 'd ever hear her scream . - come on . Stop. please . Come on. stop it . - okay , fine . Just tell me what i want to know . Your choice . Her life is in your hands . - do you need something , sweetheart ? - as a matter of fact , i do . All right . fine , fine . I will tell you anything you want to know . - thank you very much . - so you can move the earth ? - something like that . We 're all like you . A family of sorts . People with extraordinary abilities . Rebecca came to us when she was still very young . - so she 's not really your niece ? - a family is more than blood . It 's about trust , About love . About those who embrace you . The real you . Unconditionally . - becky pushed my roommate out the window . Do you embrace that ? - no , of course not . But rebecca 's complicated . Her father was murdered When she was just five years old . - okay , but how is that my fault ? - it 's not . You 're not the one she 's after . - it 's all about you . - i 'm sorry . Do i know you ? - you don 't remember me at all ? Well , i guess you wouldn 't . You never saw me . But i remember you . I was five when you came to my house , When you tried to take me and my dad away . He told me to stay out of sight . - shh . - i had never seen him so scared . [ pounds open doors ] [ whooshing ] - and then in came my dad ? [ gunfire continues ] - shooting first , asking questions later . - well , i 'm sure he had a good reason . - the reason is we were different . Potentially dangerous . Your father needed neither warrant nor probable cause . Not for people like us . Life is more complicated . - i hid under the bed and i wished ... Wished that you wouldn 't find me . And my wish came true . You didn 't see me . - your ability manifested . - i kept making wishes , That that whole night had never happened , For my dad to come back . I have spent my entire life Wondering why i could make a wish And save myself , but not him . - i thought perhaps becky had moved past it , but ... - she came to get revenge on him . - through you . - and then when i found out that you had a daughter , I stopped making wishes And i made a promise . I 'm gonna take away All of the dreams that you had for her Just like you did to me . - i 'm sorry about your father . I take responsibility for that . But you 're not going to hurt my daughter . - i 'm gonna hurt you both . - becky , i picked up your costume . Oh , um , hi . What are you doing in here ? - just , um , looking for someone . I guess she 's gone . excuse me . - i am truly sorry for what happened to your roommate . Both of them . But it was good of you To send the other away . - i didn 't send her away . She left . - well , it 's a slanted perspective To see the extraordinary Through ordinary eyes . Fear is easier than understanding . - so how do you deal with it ? - by not having to deal with it . I simply surrounded myself with people who , By definition , are like me . It 's a whole lot easier For someone like you to understand you . Which is why i came to you and not your father . We both know exactly what he would do in this situation . - no , tell me . [ gun cocks ] What would bennet do ? - i don 't mean you any harm . i swear . - he said he was becky 's uncle . - you were stalling . You kept me talking . - you seem to like to talk . You actually think that i would trust you over my dad ? - i just ran into your niece . She 's , um , not all there , is she ? - rebecca 's a very disturbed girl . But in all fairness , You had a hand in that . A responsibility . - okay , let 's talk responsibility . What do you know about this ? - what is that ? - every time i see that compass , It comes with a dead body . First was danko 's . - agent danko killed my brother . He started all this . We didn 't want any bloodshed . - well , you forgot to tell that to your knife-wielding friend Who sliced my guts open . - in the wrong hands , This compass could mean trouble for my family . We just need to stay hidden . - from who ? - well , for starters , you . No offense , sir , but you have a reputation For scorching earth to get to people like me . Please , i just need to find rebecca And get her some help . - and i want some answers . - help ! Somebody help ! She 's not breathing . - let 's get her to the e.r. - no time . it 's a pneumothorax . I can do this . Thoracotomy kit . - okay . Take over . - [ gasps ] - hey . Hey , sweetheart . You 're gonna be okay , all right ? You 're gonna be okay . You did it . - you really should watch how you treat us In front of your daughter . After all , she 's like me . - you really ought to watch what you say to my daughter . - don 't blame your father . He really doesn 't understand us . - get in the car . - [ groans ] - rebecca , no ! [ electricity crackles ] - no , come on . - dad , don 't ! - look out ! - dad , no ! - i 'm so sorry . You all right ? I 'm sorry . - okay , here 's the truth . After peter took you down , I pushed nathan 's memories into your mind . I made your body think that it was him . Your shape-shifting took care of the rest . I had never done this before . I thought that i was pushing all of sylar Out of that body . I didn 't--i had no idea That all of it would stay with me . - well , that 's just crazy . Just the check , please , lynette . Thank you . - clearly you didn 't decide to do this on your own . Who else was involved ? Mama petrelli , right ? who else ? - bennet . Everyone else thinks you 're dead . - well ... I was off to see the wrong brother . I got to go find nathan . Get my body back . - then what are you gonna do ? - then i 'm gonna kill ... Every single person Even remotely involved . [ sirens wailing ] - you should really pay more attention To what you 're doodling on a napkin . - hands up ! - police. freeze . - what the hell are you doing ? - i 'm crossing that line . You told me that i 'm not man enough to take a life . Well , you know what ? you 're wrong . 'cause i 'm gonna take yours . - you 're an idiot . you 'll die with me . - yeah . I know . - gun ! [ indistinct police radio chatter ] - i 'm sorry i pushed you . - it 's okay . i don 't bruise easy . - no , you don 't , do you ? Hey . You 're amazing . You know that ? - think you mean extraordinary . - i want you to have everything . You deserve it . A social life . The education . The white picket fence . All of it . - well , as you said , sometimes life Just isn 't that simple . Good night . - night , claire bear . [ pressing piano keys ] - who 's that ? - my nephew , christopher . He drowned . I was babysitting , and ... I got distracted for a moment . I didn 't hear him . I tried to revive him . It was right before my second year of residency . - that 's why you dropped out . - yeah . - megan wanted you to have that . She said it 's only for very special people . - special . I couldn 't save him . - but you saved her . - you saved me . Thank you . - are you gonna go back to school ? Go be a doctor ? [ presses keys ] - can you see the colors ? - no . I don 't have that power anymore . But we could still play , if you like . [ siren wailing ] - still asystolic . - all right . 360 . [ defibrillator charging ] - clear . - i 'm sorry i had to do that to you . - i 'm sorry that i messed things up with claire . I just ... Got impatient . sloppy . - don 't worry . Might not have been the plan as conceived , But i think claire bennet 's Right where we want her to be . Look , when i asked you to do this , I promised you revenge , And you 'll still have it . [ chuckles ] - uh , we have a problem . A big problem . - what ? - sylar , he 's gone . [ knocking at door ] [ knocking ] - nathan , what are you--what--what ? - oh , thank god . - what are you doing ? What 's going on ? - i think i 'm in trouble , pete . Brought to you by NdieZ

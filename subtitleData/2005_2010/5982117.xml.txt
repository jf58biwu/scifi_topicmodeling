 I just want the plans , Venture . I have the plans right here , Half-Jackal . Right here in my head . So why don 't you keep trying to beat them out ? That baby 's gonna kick like a virgin . You have to re-level quick . Go for the bastard 's neck . Do I have to kill him ? Keep him up there , Kano . I don 't care if he wets himself and your head . That boy is gonna see somebody die . And if he doesn 't want it to be his father he 's got to pull that trigger . Knew it . White , White , I 've done it . Congratulations , you 've discovered pornography . Oh , that 's unsavory . Quit it . This is serious . You see what 's written on that smoke ? That 's circumference and length . It describes a cylinder . Billy , you 've snapped . No , White . This boy genius is sane . 30 years of searching for clues ... in the old Rusty Venture cartoon has led me to this . Wow , impressive . It 's a scytale , a helical cipher . You just wrap this strip of paper ... with what appears to be nonsense around it ... and Bingo was his name-o . Well ? Don 't tell me . It 's more code . It 's all " form type equals address . " I was so close . I 'm already regretting telling you this , but that 's a URL . - What ? - Billy , it 's a website . That 's impossible . The Rusty Venture cartoon is from the ' 70s . " 52 equals country equals U.S. and geodiff " - - that 's with two f 's- - " equals one . " You got it ? Yeah , I got it . It 's a maplook map . White ? That 's a map to the Venture compound . Oh , my God , you 're right . And look at that . I could save 1 .3 miles if I take Ridge Street . The bricks on that Mayan temple- - random pattern or Morse code ? Morse code . Slide . Do giant spiders really have that many eyes ? They do when it 's code written in Braille . Slide ! That 's a shirtless drunk albino , I think . - Spring break 1 994 . - Slide ! Alright , Billy , all you 've proved is that you 're way too into cartoons ... and that I should find out why I haven 't seen dime one from those DVD sales . Wrong ! Every one of these clues and hundreds more like them have led me here- - slide- - to this spot in your compound and the final clue . Yeah , that 's my herb garden . Doc , can we talk outside ? You can say it to everybody . Oh , cool ! Brock 's gonna swear . No , he 's not . Cool , Brock 's gonna talk about naked sex ladies . Alright , fine , when I got assigned this ridic- - important assignment ... I was given explicit instructions to watch that exact patch of ground . Sorry , I 'm not digging there . Well , your employer is . See , we 've already lost Brock . And who knows who 's next ? Any one of us could meet our demise or be driven crazy by greed . The quest will not be easy . Look , Billy , you just saw me ride a komodo dragon ... and they have poisonous spit . Poisonous spit , infected mouths , komodo dragons . It 's- - if they bite you . Whatever . Nobody works as hard as Rusty Venture . Hurry up . My ice is melting . I 'm going as fast as I can . Yell at Dean for once . Your brothef 's busy helping the grown-ups . I think I have heatstroke . You have lollygagger syndrome . That 's what you have . Here , freshen this up for Daddy . White ? Sure , I 'll take another Fanta . - Billy ? - What are you drinking ? Red Mocho Cooler . It 's Kahlúa , Hershey 's syrup , and a dash of red Kool-Aid . That sounds horrible . I just hit something . Oh , now we 're talking . What ? Oh , false alarm . It 's a box full of old mops . It 's a dog corpse . Well , looks like we found where Brock buried Scamp . Scamp ? No . No-o-o-o-o ! Dean , less ice this time ! Oh , come on ! Oh , Brock , I 'm glad you 're here . This is yours , I think . It came from the past . Ooh-ooh-ooh . This is totally what we 're looking for . I recognize it from episode 209- - the Talking Cave Mystery . Whoa , is this Brock 's room ? Sweet digs , Samson . Get out of here . I have a dart board like that . You ever turn it around ? Baseball . Yeah . Get out of here ! Is this a rec room ? Please tell me there 's bumper pool . Out of my room now , everybody ! Look , I found even more treasure in there- - a mysterious card that says " Ancient Gear Fist " and a coin . I 'll bet it 's Indian money . Look , a magic nurse shoe . That 's my shoe . Hey , that 's my Yu-Gi-Oh card and my slammer pog . Aw , gyp . Dean , give me those . - What did I tell you about gambling ? - Gyp ! Out ! OK , before we open this ... if it 's gold or diamonds ... I think it 's pretty clear my father meant for me to have them . And if poison gas should come out and kill us ... I just want to tell you that ... I was the one who carved Dean 's name into the bathroom door . Thanks , Hank . I love you , Dean . OK , Billy , open it up . Oh , for the love of God . Was anybody else waiting for their face to melt off , eh ? The final clue . I can decode this . Get me a roll of toilet paper . Oh , and get me another Red Mocho Cooler . Don 't look around you , man of the future . Sandow is speaking to you from beyond the grave . The voice you now hear is coming from the Victor talking mach- - Duty that no man , dagger , bullet ... or blow harmed Colonel Venture . Foolishly , Sandow believed the device ... and my dreadful orders to protect it to be a myth . That changed . Everything changed . Look out there , Lloyd . We 're being attacked by members of our own Guild . The only way we can gain control is to activate the device now . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know we were out of options . No , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know it was sarcasm day . I 'm sorry I wasn 't aware of your delicate constitution . I 'm sorry you smell like spoiled fruit . Fantômas has a point . How dare you , sir ? Why , I smell of freshly cut flowers . Not that . Look , all of us have devoted our lives ... to perfect and protect the Orb . But we 're losing everything . Now , I can 't even afford another suit . Same suit for the last five years . Samuel , the Orb is a source of untold power . We must take our time and learn how to harness that power ... for the good of mankind . Whoa , there . Orb is ours . The Guild will decide what is best for mankind . For shame . This Guild was founded to protect and serve man at his best ... not to be a guild of calamitous intent . But ... But- - and it 's a bigger but than the huge one I sit on- - that little ball has to be tested . The ugly queen is right . I was the last to add my genius to Orb . And I , the great beast , Aleister Crowley ... will prove the mighty art of hermetic- - Whoa . Sandow , show that lunatic out . Let 's see if the chubby wizard can fly . Alright there , big guy . I get the hint . No need to get shovey ... because I will come down on you like a storm ! Aah ! OK , you see ? We can no longer trust anyone . It 's time to harness the power of the Orb ... whatever that power may be . Colonel Venture , it 's Tesla , and he 's with the Avon ladies . They have us surrounded ! To our gliders ! Don 't do it , Colonel Venture . I beg you . Sandow , my faithful bodyguard , these are desperate times . Sandow knew what had to be done . Men like us follow orders . Yes , future man , we are pawns ... but pawns that move in that crazy " L " shape ... like that horse piece . Oh , this thing is tiny . Sandow will pick this up on the other cylinder . Sorr- - Great . Alright , Hank , read it one more time . " In Minuit 's bargain sits house that coke built . " In a loud room of quiet whistlers ... " behind the wild gray gentleman , sits the 22121 0 . " Alright . Googled Minuit ... and he 's the guy who bought Manhattan Island ... from the Indians with beads or something . So , Minuit 's bargain is New York City . Obviously . Man , the poor chump who came up with this riddle ... didn 't bank on us having the internet , eh ? What 's the next line ? " In Minuit 's bargain sits house that coke built . " I 'm on it . " The house that coke built . " No , that 's the Cola . Wait . Studio 54 , New York City . It 's just like the old show . " Rusty Venture , " brought to you by- - smoking . This is tits . I 'm in your old seat , aren 't I ? I don 't remember . Alright , time to put on our costumes , Rusty . Costumes ? Did I say costumes ? I meant disguises . Did any of you find a tube about yea big ... while you were digging up my garden ? If you mean the roll ... Dad and Mr. Billy took it to New York City . Of course they did . OK , White , I 'm taking off for a while . You 're in charge of the boys . Right . Do they have a bedtime or , uh , any dietary concerns ? 'Cause I 've noticed Hank eats a lot of refined sugars . You know what ? Never mind . I 'll get Orpheus to do it . I can 't believe you talked me ... into wearing my old clothes . This is New York City , the fashion capital of the world . Trust me , we 'll blend in . I 'm serious . Next season will be all about the mancapri . Input voice identification . - Samson , Brock . - Confirmed . Search Samson , Brock , active assignment . Verify clearance level 8 . John Bonham Rocks . Confirmed . Samson , Brock , active assignment- - Operation Rusty 's Blanket . Subsearch Orders Regarding Bodyguard termination clause . Clearance level 1 0 identification number required . Alright , hold on . - Incorrect identification . - It wasn 't a number- - - Incorrect identification . - I know ! Knock it off ! Incorrect identification . Uh , uh , 2 , Delta , 9 , Romeo , Tango , 8 . Autopilot initiated . Agent Samson , Brock , terminated . Oh , what the ... Did you just fire me or kill me ? Hello ! You piece of shit ! Come on ! Argh ! Ah ! Hey , I know we shouldn 't be seen together , but , uh ... well , I saw your feature-dance here last week . Yeah ? What 'd you think ? You like the part with the fan ? Never mind . Look , butter-top , the boss man 's watching me like a hawk . Better buy me a drink . What are you drinking ? That son-of-a-bitch silverback knows damn- - Gin neat ! You cretin ! Alright , what 's the skinny ? You tell me . Sweet lord , that hack actually found it ? - Found what ? - Damned if I know . You want the bad news or the good news first ? I don 't know- - the good , I guess . There is no good news ! Just bad news and weird news . You were never assigned to protect wee little Rusty Venture . You were assigned to protect something else . Or maybe to protect us from something else . What does that mean ? It means that the man you thought you had to protect is a godless idiot . His father hid some rotten device from him . Guess he figured if he had the noodle to find it ... he 'd know what to do with it . I 'm also guessing he was wrong ! Yep . That 's the weird news . The bad news is that if he tries to activate the device ... you have to take him out . Before the O.S.I. takes me out , I suppose . What do you want ? A moment to cry over a spilled life ? You 're a pawn , son . So , what is this device I 've been protecting ? How will I even know when I see it ? Known the whole time . Operation Rusty 's Blanket . Orders Regarding Bodyguard . Orb . That 's all I know . You want any more information ... you got to ask another Venture bodyguard . I can 't . Doc took the second cylinder to New York . Don 't know what you 're talking about , and I don 't care . You take this hot wad of cash and do what you got to do . Don 't you dare ask me what I did to get those $ 1 00 bills . Mine is not to poop on anyone 's parade ... but Studio 54 ? This box is from the Victorian era . Alright , fella , then what do you think it is ? This isn 't my forte ... but I know a cipher master ... who knows the 1 9th century like the back of his hand . I 'll be right back . Cool . He 's astral projecting . Dean , you know what to do . Oh , my God ! What do you eat ? ! Wake up , fat boy . I have been waiting half my life for this moment ... but I never dreamed it would be you they sent , Brock Samson . Look , nobody sent me . Wait a second . I thought you were a mute . My silence was a choice . I have taken from this world a great man . My silence is my penance . Now end my suffering , O.S.I. man . Alright , look , I 'm not here to kill you . I 'm here because Doc is looking for the Orb . Orb ? Master Rusty has found Orb ? Did he find it under the couch while looking for change ? Yeah , well , he 's not only looking for whatever the hell Orb is ... but he has my second gramophone cylinder . I don 't even- - have a clue what 's going on here . Wait here . I have something for you . I tell you , Brock Samson , it feels good to talk again . I 've been holding so much in . Do you watch Top Chef ? Uh , yeah , but I didn 't like Top Design . Oh , it feels so good to talk . Let 's go to karaoke bar . I so want to sing Humpty Dance . Uh ... Yes , yes , we go later . First , you should listen to this . What is that ? The other cylinder ? Well , what the hell does Doc have ? Knowing Rusty- - roll of toilet paper ? - OK , " In Minuit 's bargain ... " - Manhattan . - " ... sits house that coke built . " - Studio 54 . - " In a loud room of quiet whistlers ... " - Backstage in the bathroom . - " ... behind the wild gray gentleman ... " - That guy . " ... sits the 22121 0 . " Which has to be that foldaway changing table . And I bet we already know the model number . Oh , that is never not fun . Oh , oh , man . Orpheus , they TP 'ed your corporeal form . That is hilarious . Yes , of course . A regular panic . Oh , OK . So , why have you summoned the alchemist ? ♪ Ba-daa ! ♪ To solve a mystery . The mystery of the box we found in Brock 's garden . Alright . Give me the clues . I 'm on the job . Sandow thinks it may not be a good idea . They 're dying out there . All over this . - What is it ? - The Orb . Archimedes himself began the construction ... with little more than the mirror alignment . Da Vinci added the gearings , Newton the lenses ... Galileo the prisms . All of the great poets , painters , scientists ... alchemists , and philosophers have had the Orb in their hands . But what is it ? Some say it 's a weapon of catastrophic proportion . I believe it to be a type of engine ... self-sustaining and of endless power . I believe this , Sandow , because I am a man of hope . Colonel Venture , please don 't activate it . Sandow , I must . Then so must Sandow . Sandow will forever carry this burden like a- - That 's about it . The rest is Sandow listing chocolate recipes . That 's why I kept it . I like to bake . So , did you have to do it , too ? Kano , did you kill the great Dr. Venture Sr. ? Oh , so , now you 're a mute again . Well , at least we don 't have to sing karaoke now . Come on . Please ? Studio 54 is the house that coke built ? You guys went crazy from everything after that guy that sold Manhattan . Yeah , I got that one . Alright , let 's start again . Get me a dictionary . We have the internet . I don 't want to play World of Warcraft . Get me a regular dictionary . Ugh . Internet . It 's only good for finding out that your boyfriend is sleeping around . Freaking Myspace . What ? I 'm not supposed to look at his friends ' comments ? They 're right on the first page . That 's hardly snooping . Alright . I have your antique . Look up " coke . " Give me the first definition . Hold ... on . OK . " Noun . The residue of coal ... " left after destructive distillation and used as fuel . " Who ever heard of that ? Gentlemen , we need a coal magnate with a home in Manhattan . Two points- - the alchemist . There 's nothing in there but discotheque . It could be something small ... like an IBM stock or something . Keep looking . Hey , what do we got here ? Is there a problem ? No , officer , no problems here . Just , uh , changing my son . That 's a mighty big boy you got there . Bet he 's , uh , he 's gonna be a football star , huh ? Well , don 't let me disturb you . Carry on . OK , there , Billy . Up-a-bum . Lift your little fanny . Daddy 's gonna change you now . This is how we lost George Michael . Come in , Boy Wonder , this is control . Studio 54 is not the coke house . Head to the Frick museum on- - What 's that all about ? My Nintendo DS Lite ? Goo-goo , gaga . - Butter me , Hank . I 'm on a roll . - OK . Um , how ? Alright , how is " wild " in the " wild gray gentleman " spelled ? Ye old-e-fashioned way . What the hell does that even mean ? With an " e . " You know , wild-e . That 's not old-e fashioned . That 's a surname . Oscar " ding-dong " Wilde . Alright , give me some time here . Control . What is your 1 0-20 , Boy Wonder ? Hank , it 's Brock . Where 's your father ? Kind of lost contact with him . But he should be going to the Frick museum with Mr. Billy . Alright , book me on the next flight to Laguardia . How ? I don 't know , Hank . Get White to do it . Sweet pecan pie , I 've solved it . Alright , now , try to keep up . " In a loud room of whistlers " is the Whistler wing in the Frick . " behind the wilde gray gentleman ... " refers to Whistlef 's painting of Robert de Montesquiou ... the guy who was the model for Dorian Gray . And who wrote The Picture of Dorian Gray ? Edgar Allan Poe . Not even close , Hank . It was Oscar Wilde . So , " behind the wilde gray gentleman " means ... " behind the portrait of Montesquiou . " Get it ? A-almost . Doesn 't matter . Just call your dad . Billy , knock it off . You almost hit the painting with your arrow . Don 't even try to tell me ... that hasn 't been your fantasy since you saw The Pink Panther . So , it 's behind this ? Alright , let 's tear it down . Uh , don 't you think we should check out the room behind this ... before we destroy a priceless masterpiece ? Rusty 's back . It 's the old stuff , Billy . I 'm feeling it again . Alright . " Behind the Wilde gray gentleman sits the 22121 0 . " - Super . - OK , I think I got something . The 22nd letter is- - I got it ! Billy ! Billy ! Keep it down . We 're in a museum . Trying to get us popped ? Sorry . I cracked the final code . It was a simple substitution . We are looking for an Orb . Wow , you are back . Me and Rusty Venture solving mysteries . We haven 't found it yet , so keep your pants on . Why ? Are you planning on taking them off again ? Paperweight , my ass . Hello , sweet thing . Well , like my dad used to say ... " You want to hide something leave it where everybody can see it . " My god , it 's gorgeous . - Let me see . - No . Don 't know what it is yet . Could be dangerous . What ? Wrong . I got to know what it is . Been looking for that fucking thing for 30 years . - Billy , don 't be such a dick . - Poop . This isn 't an invention . It 's a responsibility . I need to study this . And if we find that it will help mankind move peacefully forward ... then we shall share its teachings ... because we are not only men of science . - We- - - Are men of hope . How did you know what I was gonna say ? What ? Your dad said that at the end of , like , every episode . Oh . Well , he was right . I mean , he was always right . My dad hid this for a reason , and we have to respect that . The guy was a crappy father . But , Billy , I 'll tell you , he- - he was a great scientist . No . Rusty , please . Come on . You got to hit this . Don 't leave me hanging . Alright , just once . And if this ever gets out ... My lips are sealed . Go team Venture ! Hey , pop . What was the treasure ? What ? Oh , it was nothing . Just a-a note from my father . Where 's Brock ? I want him to get right on fixing up his room . It 's a pigsty . I thought he was with you .

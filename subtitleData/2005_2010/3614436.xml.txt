 - You 're always sick . - You were sick when you were my age . - Evening , sir . - Evening , Victor . I didn 't realize you were still here . I was just keeping James company , sir , if that 's all right . Very kind of you . - Any better , Son ? - still cold , Father . Just a mild fever . - You 'II be all right in the morning . - You always say that . And you always pull through , don 't you ? - Yeah . - Now , you taking your medicine ? elizabeth ! elizabeth ! - Your father 's drunk again . - elizabeth ! - You should help him home , Victor . - It 's not my name he 's calling , sir . - Father ! - Stay where you are , James . - Get off me ! - Father ! Now ! You never loved him ! I told you never to come back here . Get out ! James ? - No . - James ? - There are things you don 't understand . - Don 't . - I need him to know ! - please don 't . - No more lies . - James ... - No ! - James ! He ... He wasn 't your father , Son . What are you ? - I didn 't mean it ! I didn 't mean it ! - Yes , you did ! He deserved it , and you gave it to him . We 're brothers , Jimmy . You realize that ? And brothers protect each other . You have to be hard now , hard so nothing can ever touch us . - I want to go home . - We can 't . We stick together , no matter what , and take care of anyone who gets in our way . Can you do that , little brother ? - I 'm going down to the river . - They 're coming . - Head over the hill . Hurry ! - Can you run ? - Keep on running and don 't look back . - Okay . Back to back ! That 's enough ! Enough ! No ! No ! Stand down , soldier ! Victor ! Stand down ! Stand down ! Stand down ! No ! Ready , aim ... Wake me when it 's over . ... fire ! Freaks ! You 're animals ! Freaks ! My name is Major william Stryker . You 've been charged with killing a senior officer . Is that correct ? apparently , we have some issues with authority ... - Just keep a lid on it . - ... sir . The warden tells me that your sentence was carried out by a firing squad at 1000 hours . - How 'd that go ? - It tickled . You boys tired of running ? Tired of denying your true nature ? - What do you care ? - Oh , I care . I care because I know how special you are . How valuable . Look , you can stay here locked up like freaks of nature , or you can join me . I 'm putting together a special team with special privileges . Now , tell me , how would you Iike to really serve your country ? You know , I Iove this weapon more than any other thing in the whole wide world . - Do you wanna know why ? - No . It 's memorable . Sure , it 's a little bulky , tough to get on a plane . You whip out a couple of swords at your ex-girIfriend 's wedding , they will never , ever forget it . That 's funny , Wade . I think you confuse me with someone who gives a shit . Right , it 's probably not as intimidating as having a gun or bone claws or the fingernails of a bag lady . - Manicure ? - Victor . Easy . Fred got a new tattoo . I 'm concerned . Oh , Jesus , Fred , you just met her last night . - I Iove her . - You love her after one night ? She 's a gymnast . bradley , take her down . Oh , God . - Are you gonna puke ? - If we were meant to fly , - we 'd grow wings . - Don 't worry , Nancy . - More people die driving than flying . - How about from impaling ? Hey , be nice , or be your approximation of nice . - would you Iike a bucket ? - No . gentlemen , wheels down in Lagos in five . - Why are we here ? - AII in good time . Zero ? - Intruder ! Perimeter breach ! - Man the weapon ! Intruder , stop ! Put your hands behind your head ! Having fun yet ? - Fred ? - The tank ? - The tank . - Yeah , I got that . Great . Stuck in an elevator with five guys on a high-protein diet . - Wade . - Dreams really do come true . Just shut it ! - You 're up next . - Thank you , sir . You look really nice today . It 's the green . It brings out the seriousness in your eyes . - Oh , my God . Do you ever shut up , pal ? - No . Not when I 'm awake . bradley ? Top floor , please . Cover the elevator ! The elevator ! Time to go to work . Okay . people are dead . If you didn 't have that mouth on you , Wade , you 'd be the perfect soldier . I wouldn 't do that if I was you , brother . - Take the diamonds . They 're yours . - I don 't want your diamonds . I want this . But that is nothing . A souvenir . Where did you find it ? I want the source . A small village , far inland , three days from here . tell him this rock is more valuable to me than his life . Ask him where he found it . Okay . He says it came from the sky . He 's telling the truth . You don 't know the language , Logan . - It 's a meteor fragment . - I know what it is . I 'm asking him where he found it . Sir , base wants to know our location . - Shut them down . - Yes . tell him everyone here will die unless he tells me where he found the rock . - He says that it 's sacred . - Okay , fine . Victor . Victor ! Don 't even think about it . We didn 't sign up for this . Put him down ! What are you doing ? We finally got a good thing going here . Don 't you screw this up . Enough . That 's enough . We 've done enough . Who do you think you are ? This is what we do . Maybe you 'd rather be rotting in a hole somewhere till they figure out a way to do it to us . Is that it ? Huh ? I 'm done . You coming ? Jimmy ! We can 't just let you walk away . Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Why are you up so early ? Come here . See you , baby . Hey . Oh , that 's nice . Yes . Take your time . You 're wrapped , man . Okay , I 'm totally gonna get this . Nope . Come on . Oh , wow ! Let 's go on the Ferris wheel . - How does he do it ? - Come on . ... amazing lady in a box ! Swing the hammer , ring the bell ! Hey , what do you do ? If you turn off the light , you win a prize . - Three tries for a buck . - Come on , I wanna do it . There you go . Okay ? No , that 's obvious . That 's two . well , that 's a stupid trick . It 's not a trick , man . Come on . Freak . Bye . Show 's over ! I said show 's over ! The show 's never over for us , bradley . - Victor . - Aren 't you gonna invite me in ? Yeah . Come on in . You know , I 've never said anything to anyone about what happened . I 'm living a totally different life now , Victor . No need to bring up the past . You know , I always thought it wouId be Wade to come knocking at my door . well ... well , Wade 's gone . I 'm not afraid of you , Victor . I 'm not afraid of dying . How do you know ? You 've never tried it before . Was it the wars ? Which one ? AII of them . - tell me . - Hey . It 's just a scratch . Looks like we 're gonna need new sheets again , baby . Yeah . Who the hell is this ? smells like government . My God . Haven 't aged a day ! clean living . - You remember Agent Zero ? - still shooting first , asking questions later ? - You still chewing on cheap cigars ? - Boys , please . - I have a job for you . - I already have a job . Lumberjack ? 18 grand a year ? 18.5 . plus I haven 't had to kill anyone in a while . - Starting to miss it ? - Right about now I am . - Yeah ? - Zero , back to the car . Attaboy . You know , I 'm not proud about the way things ended between us . Conversation 's over . playing Little House on the Prairie with a schoolteacher , I mean , that just isn 't you , Logan . And you would know , huh ? - I would . - What do you want , Stryker ? bradley was killed three days ago . Wade before that . I believe that someone is hunting down our old team . - Anyone else ? - As far as I know , Victor is safe . But whoever it is has names , addresses . I can take care of myself . This is not about you , Logan . Your country needs you . I 'm Canadian . I know you , Logan ! I know who you are ! - Miss KayIa , Miss KayIa , look what I did . - What did you do ? Bye , Miss SiIverfox ! Bye ! What 's wrong ? Stryker came by today . Don 't worry . I said no . Why is he bothering you after all these years ? Because I 'm the best there is at what I do , but what I do best isn 't very nice . You 're not an animal , Logan . What you have is a gift . A gift . You can return a gift . Come on , fellas . AII right . Stay in the car . I 'm just gonna ask nicely . You mind letting us go by ? - You in some kind of a hurry there , pal ? - Hey , hey , hey . Are you ? Just move your truck so we can go by . We 're trying to have a conversation there , all right ? You start something , you 'd better be ready to finish it . Listen ... Hey , guys , take it easy ! calm down . - Your boyfriend 's got a big mouth . - I know . Big temper , too . So please let us pass . - Thank you . - Come on , man , Iet 's go . How 'd you do that ? female powers of persuasion . It 's a gift . Oh , I see . Do you have those powers over me ? well , you didn 't stay in the car , did you ? Why is the moon so lonely ? Why ? Because she used to have a lover . - You tell this to the kids ? - No . His name was Kuekuatsheu and they lived in the Spirit world together . Oh , this is a true story ? AII right . And every night they would wander the skies together , but one of the other spirits was jealous . Trickster wanted the moon for himself , so he told Kuekuatsheu that the moon had asked for flowers . He told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses , but Kuekuatsheu didn 't know that once you leave the Spirit world , you can never go back . And every night he looks up in the sky and sees the moon and howls her name . But he can never touch her again . Wow . Koo-koo-ka-choo got screwed . " Kuekuatsheu . " It means " the wolverine " . What you doing , Logan ? kayla . Oh , God . kayla ! You 're not from around here , are you ? What gave me away ? Victor ! - You got insurance on this place ? - Insurance ? No . - Too bad . - Victor ! well , well , well . Look what the cat dragged in . Guys , whatever this is , take it outside . Why ? Why ? You don 't call . You don 't write . How else am I supposed to get your attention ? I hate to say it , Jimmy , but , frankly , I 'm a little disappointed . Stay down . tell me something , Jimmy . Was she worth it ? When are you gonna figure it out ? We 're not Iike them . I am nothing like you . Sure , you are . You just don 't know it yet . - What do we got ? - Bar fight . multiple knife wounds . What is this , a joke ? Guy 's fine . - Where is he ? - Hey , hey , don 't ... - I said , where is he ? - I don 't know who he is . I can help you . Six years I 've been here . No one knew me , and then you show up , and the next day she 's dead ! I tried to warn you . Why didn 't you tell me it was Victor ? - I didn 't know ! - bullshit ! - Why ? - I swear on my son 's life , I didn 't ! Victor 's appetites were becoming too public . I had to lock him up . He felt I betrayed him . Went AWOL . He said he was coming after all of us . You didn 't come to warn me , you came to save your own ass . So what 's your plan , Captain ? You can 't beat him , Logan , you know you can 't ! I 'm gonna find him and kill him . I can give you the tools to defeat him . And we can still save the others . You mean save yourself , right ? I promise you two things . You will suffer more pain than any other man can endure , but you will have your revenge . I come with you , I 'm coming for blood . No law . No code of conduct . You point me in the right direction , you get the hell out of my way . When it starts , whatever the reason is that you 're doing this , focus on that . Maybe it will help . Trust me , I 've been through worse . No , you haven 't . We 're ready . We 're gonna make you indestructible , but first we 're gonna have to destroy you . You remember what we were looking for in Africa ? - I remember . - well , I found it . It helped us create a metal compound so strong that you will be able to withstand virtually anything . It 's called Adamantium . I can 't put Victor down myself , Logan . To kill him , you 're gonna have to embrace the other side . Become the animal . Let 's do this . I almost forgot . I want new ones . What do you want them to say ? wolverine . generals , welcome . general Munson . Today we 're gonna witness medical history . - Today we 're gonna create Weapon X. - X ? Roman numeral 10 . We are about to begin bonding Adamantium to Weapon X 's skeleton . Let 's begin . - We 're brothers , Jimmy . Logan ! Body temperature , 108 and rising . Why is he thrashing like that ? Why isn 't he sedated ? He feels pain just like the rest of us , but anesthesia won 't work on him . - That 's why he had to volunteer . - Heart rate , 190 . 195 . - will he survive this ? - I don 't know . 200 . Son . Heart rate well beyond maximum . - blood pressure ? - 260 over 180 and rising . He can make it . He can make it . Victor ! I love you . You 're not an animal . It means " the wolverine " . well , I guess he can die . Come on , old friend . Come back . Heart rate rising . Adamantium reservoir is depleted . No rejection . Procedure completed . - We did it . - We did it . Yeah ! Yes . Are we taking him to the island ? The island ? No . The bonding works . We 'II use his DNA for the XI . Erase his memory . Erase his memory . I think he heard you . Lock down ! Hunt him down . Take his head off . Travis . - I think there 's a naked man in the barn . - Yep . Son ? What in hell you doing ? - It 's cold . - cold . - You got no clothes on . - Yeah . - You 're not on the drugs , are you ? - No . - No , just had a rough night . - Yeah , you could say that . Come on up to the house . Some of my son 's old clothes will probably fit you . Here . Cover it up with that , huh ? I don 't want you giving the old lady a heart attack . - You all right in there ? - Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine ! Supper 's on the table . Yeah , I 'II be there in a minute . I swear , I 'm gonna pay for it . - Set it down over there . - Right . Come and sit down , son . I can 't thank you both enough for everything . It wouldn 't have been decent to leave you out there to freeze . - " Decent . " - What ? Nothing . I 'm just not really used to that word . That 's a nice chopper you 've got out there . - You know motorcycles ? - Oh ! Lord , here we go . My favorite 's a ' 48 Panhead . Bought one new off the line . I think you 're a little young for that , son . You must be exhausted . You get a good night 's sleep . In the barn . Nothing you can break out there . Why is the moon so lonely ? Why ? Because she used to have a lover . He can never touch her again . You sleep okay ? Yeah . You look like a man fixing to do a bad thing . You know what happens to men who go looking for blood ? - What ? - They find it . We all got a choice , son . - Yeah , well , mine got taken . - bullshit . This was my son 's jacket . Try it on . - Thank you . - Yep . You want to take my bike for a spin ? Test the suspension ? '64 , huh ? Man , you 're heavy . Yeah , I put on a little weight recently . - Good morning ! - Good morning . Oh . It fits you beautifully . I brought you some ... Weapon X is in the barn . He 's just murdered two civilians . blow him to bits . Let 's see if he can survive that . Come get me . blow his brains all over the road ! Damn it ! alpha one , do not lose him ! alpha two ! Target coming to you ! pull up ! pull back ! pull back ! Zero ? Zero. come in . Zero ? Zero. is Logan dead ? - I don 't know . I 'm down . Zero. is he dead ? is Logan dead ? Zero. come in . You tried to kill me . - Logan ? - Where 's Victor ? Come back to base . I 'II explain everything . We 'II take Victor down together . Wrong answer . After I kill Victor , I 'm coming for you . Logan. listen to me . If you go down this road , you 're not gonna like what you find . You wanted the animal , colonel . You got it . Those were good people back there . Innocent people . It 's funny how good , innocent people tend to die around you . Zero never stood a chance . The only thing that 'II take him down is an Adamantium bullet . This facility 's compromised . Prep transport . colonel , this is turning into a disaster . - Don 't worry . We 'II stop him . - really ? You just spent half a billion dollars making him indestructible . - Sir ? - Yes ? The young mutant you 've been looking for . We 've found him . general , Logan isn 't the only piece of this puzzle . I need to evacuate this facility . please go back to Washington . We 've got work to do . Yo hablo . I talk . Tu hablas. you talk . El habla ... Somebody translate . Summers ! Sit up and take off those glasses . I have a headache . Then you can wear them in detention after school while you write out this conjugation 100 times . - Somebody else ? - He talks . Thank you . He talks . El habla . - You sure it was Victor ? - Yeah . Damn . I 'm sorry , man . What the hell happened to him after I Ieft ? He got worse . He felt like you abandoned him . hell , we all did . But Victor , he had to prove he was better than you . Hunting and killing everything he was pointed at . Quit a few months later myself . CouIdn 't take rounding them up . - Rounding who up ? - Leave it alone . Rounding who up , John ? Hey ! Damn it , John ! We hunted our own kind , Logan . There 's a special place in hell for the things we did . Mutants ? Why ? Stryker said we 'd be making a difference , protecting people from the bad ones . How are you gonna take Victor down , Logan ? - Remember that stuff in Africa ? - Yeah , I remember Africa . What about it ? Damn . What 'd they do to you , man ? Don 't ask . Listen , Zero said something about an island . Does that mean anything to you ? Nope . But maybe Dukes knows . - Him and Zero were real tight . - Fred Dukes ? Where is he ? - He 's here . - well , Iet 's go talk to him . hold on . He don 't get in till around 4 : 00 . But I got to warn you , he developed a bit of an eating disorder . We all got our coping mechanisms . I 'm trying to whup him back into shape . Whatever you do , don 't mention his weight . Come on , Fred , if you wanna get in shape , you got to move , man . I told him he got to move . He 's got to move ! What ? Fred Dukes ? That looks like the creature that ate Fred Dukes . Hey , be nice , man . Hey , fat ... Fred . I seem to remember that girl when she was about 85 pounds , huh ? Oh , that 's funny . You 're still so funny , Logan . You know where Victor is ? - No idea . - What 's the island , slim ? Don 't let the door hit you on the way out , Logan . Listen , I ain 't leaving here till you tell me where Victor is . So come on , bub , for old times ' sake , huh ? Did you just call me blob ? No , but ... I told you not to mention his weight . Why 'd you call him blob ? I didn 't call him blob . I said " bub " . - God damn it . - Hey , hey , hey . Hey , Logan . I got an idea . - This is your idea of an idea ? - I 'm trying to help you out , Logan . Dukes don 't like you that much and you know it . - Yeah , the feeling 's mutual . - well , use them gloves , man . Dance with him a little bit . allow him to let his anger out on you . Figure if you do that , he 'II probably tell you everything you want to know . Come on , man , look at him . Got a big old ass coming out the front of his shirt . Jesus . He 's gonna have a coronary , for Christ 's sake . Is there even a stretcher big enough to take this guy out of here ? It ain 't him I 'm worried about getting out of here on a stretcher . - You 're an asshole . - Come on , Logan . - Whup his ass ! - You want it ? Dance with him , Fred ! Just like I taught you . You want to dance with me ? - Come on , Fred ! - Oh ! Oh , that feels good . Hey ! Guess what ? See , he gonna talk now . - You got him right where you want him . - Whose side are you on , anyway ? Come on ! Come on , now , lamb chop ! Damn ! Now , where 's Victor ? little dark for sunglasses , don 't you think ? - please , don 't ! please , don 't ! - Victor ! Hey , hey ! Where 's Victor ? Yeah . Victor 's with Stryker on the island . They run it together . What ? They what ? Victor will be with Stryker ? Yeah . You didn 't know that ? AII that 's left now is Logan . I trust you can handle that . - I did before , didn 't I ? - Oh , yes . You did that . Our deal . It still applies , right ? Of course . Now bag him and tag him , Captain . What 's the island ? It 's where Stryker takes them after Victor 's caught them . Wait , hang on a minute . Takes who ? Mutants . Rumor is that Stryker 's doing experiments on them there . I mean , you never wondered what happened to them ? I tried not to . They killed her so I 'd let them put Adamantium in me . They killed her for a goddamn experiment . - Where is it ? Where is it ? - Logan , Stryker kept it real secret . But a prisoner escaped there once . - Who ? - His name was Remy LeBeau . He was a street hustler from New orleans . The guards at the prison called him Gambit because he kept taking all their money at poker . - That 's all I know . - What 's Stryker up to , Fred ? What 's the endgame ? He 's taking their powers . Trying to combine them somehow . That 's all I know , Logan . That 's all I know . If I have to come back here , I 'm gonna take your head off . I 'm coming with you , Logan . - There 's no redemption where I 'm going . - I ain 't asking . There 's our dude . That 's cool . I 'm gonna go cover the back in case he rabbits . - I 'm not gonna fight with him . - Yeah , right . What ? I get in fights with everybody ? Don 't dogs kill cats ? Just go cover the back , will you ? - Give me 500 . - I 'm in . Are you Remy LeBeau ? - Do I owe you money ? - No . Then Remy LeBeau I am . Large blind 's 100 . small blind 's 50 . - May I deal you in ? - What can I get for 17 bucks ? $ 17 ? A cab ride home , perhaps ? You my brother 's new babysitter , John ? I ain 't bradley , Victor . And your creepy black coat don 't scare me . really ? Worked on Dukes . You shouldn 't have done that , 'cause now I 'm gonna kill you before Logan even gets a chance . So what brings you to our fair city , sir ? Victor Creed . And who 's that ? The man I 'm gonna kill . He works with a man named Stryker on an island . - Just need to know where it is . - And why would you think I know that ? well , ' cause I know who you are , Gambit . You 're the guy who escaped and you 're the guy who 's gonna take me back there . You know , John , there 's something I always wanted to tell you . You 're predictable . I can feel your spine , Johnny Boy . That 's funny . Never knew you had one . Those are mighty nice tags you have on there , sir . The men who took me wore tags just like them . Hey , now , bub , you listen to me . Damn it . That little ... Two years I rotted in that hellhole and I ain 't never going back . Shiny . tell me something , Jimmy . Do you even know how to kill me ? I 'm gonna cut your goddamned head off . See if that works . You 're getting slow , old man . You son of a bitch . You 're gonna die for what you did to her . Victor ! well , that 's a nice stick . Okay , shithead , here 's the deal . See , you 're gonna take me to this island , where I can kill Creed , Stryker and pretty much everyone you hate in this world . Do you understand ? You 're really gonna kill them ? As long as you stay out of my way , yeah . colonel ? - general ? - Is this Weapon XI ? AII their strengths and none of their weaknesses . You really hate them , don 't you ? No , I don 't hate them . After 20 years of working with mutants , I just know what they can do . We can win this war before it starts and save countless lives in the process . Pre-emptive action is the only action here , general . The days of our country sitting on the sidelines are over . We need to take the fight to the enemy before they take the fight to us . - I admire your passion , I do . - Thank you . But this is as far as it goes . - Weapon X was a hiccup . - We know about your son , bill . We know he 's a mutant , and we know he killed your wife . - You shouldn 't have kept that from us . - That ... That has nothing to do with my work , general . bullshit . You 're too close to this . I 'm shutting you down . Okay . You 're right . I won 't lie to you . My son did bring the problem home for me , but I took an oath to protect the American people from every threat , both foreign and domestic . - You don 't like flying , huh ? - I 'm fine . - Just concentrate on what you 're doing . - You sure ? You got a bit of sweat on your brow there . Very funny . Just keep your eyes on the ... On the what ? The clouds ? Keep my eyes on the clouds ? You 're up and down like a freaking yo-yo here ! - Where 'd you get this thing , anyway ? - Oh , this is my baby . I won her in a game . Jacks over fives . Great . relax . We 're almost there . There it is . The island . Three mile island . Hiding in plain sight . No one 's gonna snoop around a nuclear reactor . They think it 's gonna turn them into freaks . - Like you ? - Right . AII right . You ready ? Because it 's now or never . Let 's go . About time . Hey , if it makes you feel any better , this is really gonna hurt . well , yeah , it kind of does , actually . - Good luck . - Likewise . Oh , shit . How you doing ? Everything all right ? - Is he ready yet ? - A few more hours . - And he will respond to my commands ? - absolutely . Logan . welcome back to the war . Before I gut you , I want to know why . I needed your powers for the pool . - For the what ? - The mutant killer . DeadpooI . Years of searching and refining , finding the right powers that can coexist in one body without ripping it apart . My son was the first piece of the puzzle . Logan , you were the Iast . You made Weapon XI possible . I asked you to help , but you said you wanted the quiet life . well , I 've learned that nothing motivates the men in your family like revenge . Who are you ? Oh , she 's real , old friend . Did you really think we 'd just let you walk away ? You 're a dangerous man . We like to keep an eye on dangerous men . tell him about the day you died . They gave me a shot of hydrochlorothiazide . It reduces the heart rate so low it appears you fIatIined . Don 't be angry with her . She 's a real credit to your species . Did you know that her sister has diamond-hard skin ? kayla 's mutation is tactohypnosis . She can influence people as long as she touches them . Quite a useful tool in a seduction . It was never real , my friend . It was real for me . I told you if you came down this road , you wouldn 't like what you found . That story you told me about a man who gets flowers for the moon , I had it backwards . I thought you were the moon and I was your wolverine . But you 're the trickster , aren 't you ? I 'm just the fool who got played . The worst part of it is , I should have known . But I ignored my instincts . I ignored what I really am . But that won 't ever happen again . - colonel ? - Not now , kayla . I 've done everything you 've asked . My sister . You said if I helped you , you 'd let her go . kayla , it 's not as simple as that . Her mutation is unique . Quite beautiful . We just need a little more time to analyze it , that 's all . You let him go ? - Victor , please . - You can 't let him go . - You can 't beat him , Victor . - Then give me the Adamantium ! - Your tests came back . - We had a deal ! You would never survive the operation . - I can take anything he can . - No , you can 't . You 're my favorite soldier , Victor . Be patient . Your time will come . He 's using us . How about this time you die for real ? Let me go . Your little mind games don 't work on me . Victor ! feels good , doesn 't it ? AII that rage . - Do it . - Logan ! - You 're not an animal . - Oh , yes , you are . Do it . Finish it . Logan ? My sister . They have my sister . please . I didn 't trick you into loving me . It was real for me , too . please , I 'm so sorry . They have my sister . Where is she ? - Activate Weapon XI ! - The bonding process isn 't complete . Just do it ! Now ! Come on . Come on ! Okay . Perfect . - kayla , get these kids out of here . - Logan ... Find another way out . Okay . Let 's go . Wade , is that you ? Guess Stryker finally figured out how to shut you up . Now ... Wade ? You don 't have to do this . AII right , maybe you do . You 're shitting me . Shoot on sight ! - I can help ! Point me at them ! - Go . Go ! Now ! - Did I get them ? - Yeah . - Let 's go . - I can 't go . - kayla , come on ! - I have to stay here . You take them . Go ! Go ! Go left . Left . - What ? - We go left . - You can 't see . - Trust me . Let 's see you dance up here . Nobody kills you but me . Back to back ! - I got him ! - Oh , no , you don 't . Stop ! This can 't be the way . - This is the way . - How do you know ? I just know . Come on . Adamantium bullets . Let 's see him heal with a few of these through his thick skull . You can 't stop him , even with that . - He 'II heal . - His brain may heal , but his memories won 't grow back . This doesn 't change anything between us , Victor . - We 're done . - We can never be done , Jimmy . We 're brothers , and brothers look out for each other . - You miss me ? - Ah , Jesus . You know , when you said you were gonna kill everyone , I thought you may just have been exaggerating . Yeah . Do I Iook like a man who exaggerates ? - You 're welcome . - Logan ? Logan . There 's kids trying to get off the island . split up . Go ! I 'm on it . kayla ! kayla ! Hey . I Iove you . - Hey ... - I 'm so cold . Listen to me . I 'm gonna get you out of here . Understand ?

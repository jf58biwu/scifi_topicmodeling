 T minus 120 to burn . M.F.B is go . Hydrogen go . Deuterium sequence started . Stabilizers set on 1-4-0 . Positioning thrusters on 7-niner-7 . Seal generators are engaged . Oh My God , she is out ! Ted , I got Zoe out in the air-lock . She 's in the Air-lock 4 . Do you copy ? Somebody get down here , stop her . Zoe ? Zoe ! Hey . Please , I ... No , no , no . You go ahead , you look like you have a need . OK . Guten morgen . – Hey . – Briefing in 20 minutes . All right . So glad that you have joined us . All right . You 're supposed to be wearing your H.A.L.O. I 'm wearing mine . Mission control says that com channels 30 to 45 are glitchy . – I 'll a look at the transmitter . – Thank you . And ... Sorry ! Sorry . Thanks for joining us , Zoe . Now , I know I may be the new guy , But I like for daily brief and for 24 rundown , to start at 07 : 00 . – My mother called . Won 't happen again . Is anyone noticed that com 45 is glitchy ? – Yeah , I 'm already on it . What ? Zoe , you will be assisting Jen with her N.A.S.T.E.L " A " in the science lab . Then you gonna join Paula , Donner and Mintz for the Venus suit check up . Wassenfelder , says that you are looking for DU.N.N.O.S. ? DU.N.N.O.S ... Dark , unknown , non-reflecting , non-detectable objects somewhere . In another words : dark matter . – In another words : nothing ! If nothing is 90 percent of the universe , then nothing . All right , guys , look I know Donner and I coming on board last minute is ... a little awkward . – Not for me . – Well it is for most of us . This is a huge , unexpected adjustment for all of us . So please bear with us . We have a lot of catching up to do . Any questions , comments , concerns ? Carry on . Do you guys mind if we take just a minute here ? I think its important to remember where we are . You would think that there would be a sadness ... when you start to pull away from Earth . An ache for the mountains , what 's left of the beaches . For the sweet smell of fresh air . My guess , there is a little bit of that . But , when you are an astronaut , you start asking your self questions like ... How the hell did I get here ? Was it hard work ? Fate ? Was it the hand of God ? You ask yourself : why am I one of the lucky suckers leaving ? And not one of the poor bastards being left behind ? I think that the obvious question is simply : what the hell happened ? And the obvious answer is that we do not really know . One minute we 're on the mission . The next minute we 're off . You had no warnings , no previous conditions ? Well , A.J and Rollie had small irregularities that became exacerbated on the launch and the trip up to the ship . If this had been a shorter mission , they would still be up there . But the fact is , this is a 6 years flight through the solar system . This was a extremely difficult decision and one that 's been extraordinarily hard on the astronauts and their families . Please , respect that . So , will you two be joining the team on the floor now ? We certainly hope so . After a little RR ( rest and recuperation ) and ... life adjustment . Thank you very much . Thank you . Sorry , A.J. As am I , Arnel . Those were the breaks , ah ? I guess my place is here , now . Hi , students . Welcome on " Antares " . And a very special welcome to the fifth graders at Lincoln Elementary in Findlay in Ohio . I am Paula Morales , the mission H.A.L.O specialist . And this is day three of our amazing mission through the solar system . We are all just starting to settle into our routines and starting our science work . Isn 't that right , Jen ? – Yeah , yeah , that 's right Paula . – This is our mission biologist Jen Crane . Hi Rollie . Hey baby . And this is our mission geologist , Zoe Barnes . Today Jen is starting a mission long experiment in natural selection . – Can you tell us what that is Jen ? – Well , what we are doing is we are studying the differences in rabbit sperm and egg selection in weightless environment as opposed to the weighted one . – Does that mean you actually make bunnies ? No , we harvest the DNA from the fertilized embryos and then we destroy them . And then we start all over again using that new DNA to fertilize new embryos . It 's a ... pretty much as close as we gonna get to sex in space . Have a look . See that ? Look at that determination . I had a boyfriend like that once and I 'm telling you ... booty call . Uhmmm . Today we will be testing your basic swim skills . Those of you who don 't have any will be packing your bags and aye , this is a pass / fail situation . We gonna start you guys out tr * water . Sound simple ? Twenty minutes , no hands . When you are finished you pull yourself in the life raft unaided . – It 's your body . It 's your life , and I 'm not gonna tell you what to do with it . – Good . Thank you . It 's just the sooner you abort the better you feel , physically and mentally . – Yes , I 'm thinking about it . We don 't wont to do that if you can 't swim . Seriously , this is the end of the line for me . Negativity prepares the mind for losing . You are not a loser . – I 'm not a swimmer , dude . Alright , can we start by the training underwater for zero gravity . I feel like I 'm gonna puke . – Alright , we do that with scuba gear that take adventage of neutral buoyancy . Wow . Anything that big still got to hurt . – How do you think he got it ? – It 's a war injury . Whatever happened to him , he 's lucky he survived . You should ask him . No , you ask him . Scars like that come with scars . There 's nothing to think about . Honey , is this guy worthy of your gene pool ? You see , if you can 't answer that one quickly you should just forget about it . I mean , I don 't understand why are you protecting mystery man anyway . If he 's telling you he had a vasectomy then he is telling the same thing to other women and he should be outed immediately . – Questions ? Group one , you 're in a pool in two minutes . – Wow , wow , what group are we ? – Three . – Three ? That 's my least favored number . – You are going to be fine , Wass . Come on . " You are going to be fine , Wass . Come on . " The miracle of life . Space babies Rollie and I always joked they 're gonna be our kids . But you destroy them to harvest their DNA . Yea , when they 're 10 cell embryos , Paula . That 's the experiment . Still , in a way you are killing your children . Little Miss Sunshine . Zoe , we are going back to airlock to power up the Venus suit . We 'll need you in about 20 minutes . – Copy that . Excellent . I 'll come with you to make sure that the cameras are set up . – Happy to see him ? – Nadia is happy to see him . That is all about knocking boots and you know it . I really don 't care . I really don 't . Still , you have to admit , its weird having Donner and Ted up here . Isn 't it ? I couldn 't even begin to tell ya . Okay , A.J. Take a deep breath . We will hold off any cardiac procedures and put you guys on thinners . Maybe the plaque will dissolve on its own . – How soon can I get back on the floor ? Mike you can use CAPCOMS as soon as you will feel ready . – I am ready now . And I 'm gonna need you to help brief Ted . Yeah , of course . This can 't be easy for him , either . It isn 't easy for any of us . Why do you think he waited so long to reject us ? This is as big a mystery as the day that we found it . All we can do is follow its lead . And A.J ? Will he be coming back on the floor ? Goss wants to do a thorough psych eval . If he passes ? He won 't pass , Rollie . Barnes , you coming down ? The suit is up and waiting for ya . I 'll be right in . If only I could ... fly . The people I know ... Aren 't strangers . Where I live is ... In a house . Now , there is a woman who needs some love . Oh , you mean the blonde with the glasses at the bar . Aha , take it she gets an eye . Eh , I am pretty sure that I 've seen her at the training center . That puts her off-limits to you . No , she is not off-limits unless she is a candidate . That 's her fourth drink . She is drinking alone , so something tells me she screw the pooch . – Did you just said " screw the pogue " ? " Pooch " . I said " pooch " . – Oh , oh , oh , oh . There she goes . – Gentlemen . – Be careful . – Better hurry . – She may bite . – She looks a little green . Excuse me , do you have a ... Thank you . I am a little emotional . I 'm just a ... I ... You wanna know what I did today ? Do you want to know what 's wrong with me ? You want to know ? I spent my whole ... freaking life ... Working my ass off ... I mean , dreaming about this , when chances ... one freaking chance , and I ... I blew it . Hi mom . No , it 's cold up here . I have the sniffles . Who ? No , I haven 't called him yet . I haven 't had the time , mother . Do you even remember why I came up here ? It was not to meet your podiatrist 's nephew . I don 't care if he 's a Scorpio , mother . Cancer women have got to be compatible to some other sign and I 'm not — No ... no I am not interested in a relationship right now . I am ... How many times do I have to say ... You know what , mom ? I am ... I am gonna go . I am done with this . So say " I love you " . I love you too . Bye . You know they are making these things for 200 years . You think they would come up with something better then these buttons ? You can get them with zippers , and this is the ladies room . Couldn 't fool me with that language . Kiss your mother with that mouth ? That 's freaking shocking . – Alright , you are mocking me . Screw you , Maddux ... Donner . You 're Maddux Donner . Is that a good thing or a bad thing ? Bad being ... a sorry excuse for a guy who left two people on Mars , or the good 's , the tragic American hero you wanna take home and comfort . That is pathetic . You 're not gonna pee ? Four beers goes right through me , but you * have the big bladders . Are you stalking me ? I probably could 've taken a pee in the men 's room . Get out ! I 'll be at the bar . – Ow , ow , ow . – Astronauts don 't say ow . Well , apparently they do now , Donner . I just did . I 'm in . – Control , Zoe 's in . – Roger that , Donner . Lock and load . Is that you , Rollie ? Just came on shift . Is A.J back on too ? Negative , Maddux . He 's got some pretty testing to go through . He 'll be out here soon . – Well , everybody up here thinks ... we 're making piss poor replacements . Well , you let us be the jugde on that . Helmet on ? – Roger that . The Venus suit ... was delivered to Antares over six months ago . This is Zoe 's chance to check out all of the critical operating systems . The motors to help her move , the life support system and most importantly ... to check for any tiny leaks ... that may have developed in the seals . We do this now , so if anything is wrong ... we have time to fix it . Comprende ? Suit 's secure . The suit is secure . We are go for pressure . Zoe ? I 'm set for a normal air mixture . – Copy that . – Everything is go for power up . Executing power up . Dr Mintz , can you tell us why Zoe needs this much protection on Venus ? Well , the surface temperature on Venus is over 800 ° Fahrenheit ... and the air pressure is that of 90 Earth atmospheres . So even a tiny micro leak in her suit can be catastrophic . Can you tell us how you will check for leaks ? Zoe 's suit can be pressurized to 5 atmospheres ... We 're gonna drop the airlock pressure to that of a vacuum ... and if there is any breach at all , her pressure will fall . – Hey , lover . – Hey . We miss you ... a lot . Roy made you a bowl of cereal this morning . He forgot you were gone . How are you holding up ? I 'm still in shock . It 's hard to take in within a few days . Rollie will help you get through it . And then you will have to help the crew when you get to Venus . It won 't be easy . Why did it do this , Eve ? You 're the expert . Why did it wait till the last minute ? – Rollie was asking the same question . – Because it doesn 't make sense . We know so little about Beta , about what it ultimately wants . But apparently , it picked you and Donner . For what ? And why are we any better than A.J and Rollie ? – I don 't know . – Well what do you know , Eve ? What do you guys know ? This is a huge mission . – It knows . Beta knows . That 's the leap of faith here . We need you to visit Pod 4 , honey . It chose you . Maybe it will give you an answer . If you 're the active cap com , then what are you doing talking to me ? Well , Arnel and Donner are running suit check with Zoe ... so I thought I grab a little sugar with my baby . I still can 't believe you 're not up here with me . A.J says it has to do with our true path in life . There 's nothing we could do . Yeah , but they drag you all the way back there ... and they don 't do a cardiac procedure ? – They have us on thinners . They think the plague might resolve all on its own . I 'm making our babies . I caught a little bit of Paula 's show this morning . She 's explaining the Venus suit right now . She ragged on me for having to kill the embryos . An obnoxious way to put it , but she is entitled to her views . Yeah , as am I. And you have plenty ... which is why I love you . You know I want babies with you , don 't you , Rol ? I know , baby . Plenty of time for that when you get back . Yeah . Yeah . Couldn 't you do that on Earth ? Whatever it is you 're doing . The short answer is yes . So , why do they bother launching your fat ass up here to do it ? This conversation was old when you had your boobs done . You are avoiding an answer . You don 't think I ask myself that question every day ? Seriously . I never should have made it through the program . I know that . But put yourself in my shoes . If they offered you this , would you ever turn it down ? Look at Nadia Schilling . Her elbows are out of the water . So are her breasts . She is flashing the eyes . She really think that will help her get a better note ? I hate men . Group one , into the raft ! Group two , into the pool ! Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go . This is so stupid . What ? I am not even gonna make it that far . What 's the point ? The point is that you try . You made it this far , Wass . Who 's to say you are not meant to go the whole way ? – Me . I am saying it ! – It is never your own choice . You 've painted your face and went on an unauthorized EVA . Is that a rational behavior for an astronaut ? I understand completely what I did was highly emotional and self destructive response . When you feel like your destiny has been ripped from your body , you are without the rudder in a fierce wind , completely overtaken by the emotion ... of that moment . How is he ? Sane and moving . For this I truly apologize . But that won 't get him anywhere , will it ? Left arm forward . Nominal . – Arm bend . – Nominal . Twist on diagonal . Nominal . Full range of motion , though I fill like the Michelin man . Yeah , it has always been an uncanny resemblance . Hey ! That 's it for a test , Control . We are nominal in all . We copy that . Zoe , you can give me a pressure reading of your heads up ? – Just over 73 PSI . – 5 atmospheres . Perfect . Same we got out here . Let 's see what happens in the vacuum . Copy that . I 'm gonna try a turn around here . Something wrong , Zoe ? – Did you hear that ? – Hear what ? On the com ? Are those glitches still there ? Yeah , just a little feedback on the com . You okay ? Nominal , Donner . I 'm perfect . Ah Rollie , just give me a second here before you secure . Copy that . Tether is not required , Donner . The outside hatch is not opening . Well , airlocks makes me nervous a little , let 's just leave it at that . Alright , Paula , let 's clear . Pod 4 engaged . Zoe , please don 't . Flight , we have a breach . Open the hatch ! – Donner ? – Zoe ! The pressure blew her out . Ted , we got a problem . Hatch failed . Zoe 's out . Repeat . Zoe 's out . What the hell 's happening ? Exterior airlock hatch opened . Zoe 's out . She had to hit the hatch pad . We didn 't do it here . Thank God she 's tethered . Zoe , you OK ? Suit 's operating ? I 'm a little shaken up , but everything looks nominal . What the hell happened ? I don 't know . Did you hit the hatch pad ? – I did not hit the hatch pad . – Well , I 'm just asking . Well , you don 't need to ask because I did not pull the freaking ... eject lever . – Fine . Can you get a hold of anything ? Not a chance . I feel like a fishing lure . Set tight . I 'm gonna roll you in . – 10 bucks . – 10 bucks for what ? – 10 bucks is a no go . – No go ? – He goes home alone . – Ok , here she comes . Can I have my debt , please ? He took care of it . Tell him thank you ... And to go screw himself . My man ! You 're losing your touch . Yeah , certainly looks that way , doesn 't it ? Damn . No , no , don 't give up . I think she likes you . You might have a better luck without the sunglasses . Of course , if you 're looking for this , you left it with the bartender . I think it was on purpose . – Did you bring any ... – What ? Do you have any ... I 've had a vasectomy . Is he in the program ? Why would I tell you if he 's in the program ? – Okay , so he 's in the program . – What ? It 's an easy denial , Zoe . Is he in the program ? " No " . You ? Okay ... So , which one of these schmucks is dumb enough to tell you he had a vasectomy ? Group two , in the raft . Group three , into the pool . Oh God . Is he an instructor ? We stop ? Can we please just stop ? You never gonna find out , cause I 'm never gonna tell you . – Tell her what ? – Nothing . Wass , let 's go . Wass ? Wass ! Did you guys see him ? – No . – Wass ? – Let 's look around . Let 's go . Come on out of the water . – Shaw , where did Wass go ? Control ? – We 're here , Zoe . Just talking about your suit . – That 's good , because my heads-up says I am losing pressure . Hear that , flight ? We have a leak . Copy that . It 's built like a tank . Should hold . Donner ? Zoe , can you give me some numbers ? I 'm at 65 P.S.I. 64.7 ... .3 ... We could go to the O.P.S. The concern down here is that ... introducing more pressure may cause the leak to open further . Guys , I am coming with you to Venus . I 'm gonna need to get you back inside as fast as we can . Okay . We have to depressurise this compartment , so he can get out . Let 's clear the bay . Move it , guys . – She 'll be OK ? Will she , Donner ? – Yeah . Yes , she 'll be fine . – What the hell were you doing ? – I was a lifeguard , you idiot . Haven 't you ever heard of passive rescue ? – What ? Literately , you have not . Passive rescue means not struggling with the drowning , but ... you rather allow him to pull you down . When the victim tires and starts to drown , he becomes weak enough that you take control and bring him to the surface I was doing what I was trained to do . What the hell were you doing ? I was trying to help you ! Well , then , be a gentleman and help me to pull him out of the water . – My frigging pleasure . What ⁈ The Canis Major . Finding constellations at 2 in the morning with the buzz on is fun . Not so much at 7 am with a hangover . Yea , I 'm stretching it anyway . My Mirzam is a little far from my Sirius . – Yeah , I was gonna mention that . – I didn 't hear you complain . What 's the matter ? The test . Oh , come on . Stop with the tests . It 's easy for you to say . You 've been to Mars . It 's a psych-eval . There 's no right or wrong answer . Unless you saw the black splotches as being severed body parts , you 're fine . My answers to Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blanks went something like ... " If only I could ... fly . " OK . " The people I know ... aren 't strangers . " " Where I live is ... in a house . " That 's what you said ? All right , those are perfectly fine answers . Maybe if I was applying for space pre-school . Yeah . Could I 've been a little bit more stupid ? Well ... A ... Let me tell ya , actually ... ya know , couple years back , we had this candidate by the name Rogers . Okay ? I took this guy up in the trainer , and he 's puking the whole time , all right ? So , we set her back down again and he 's so desperate to get out that he thinks that eject lever is the canopy . – He did not . 150 feet strait up ... 150 feet down . Boom . The 'chute didn 't have time to open . That 's terrible . – Yea , but he was more stupid than you . – He died ! Yea , but it was funny . Donner , this is personal . Don 't you get it ? That guy is me . I am a clueless dead guy . I just pulled the eject lever . Closest that I 'm gonna get to the space program , was last night , here , screwing you . Oh , so that 's why you did it ? – Did what ? – Screw me last night . Get your little piece of the space program ? I 'm sorry . Wasn 't that part of your pick up line ? Yeah , for civilians . You know , I thought that you are a civilian . I don 't screw astronauts . Then , why did you sleep with me ? I don 't know . Drunk . Wrong . So ... wrong ! I got you ! – What 'd ya mean you got me ? You knew ! Even when I told you why I was here . You knew ! What did I know ? You knew that I will never make it into the program . Zoe Barnes ! Hi . Yes . Right . Well , yes I am flying out this morning . That 's very nice of you to say . Thank you . Yes . Thank you very much for calling . That was the Agency Administrator . Hey , I am sorry . Look , they ... There 's something like a 1000 applicants for every person that makes it . It 's really brutal . Just ... kiss me . OK ? You wanna roll one more time before your flight ? I don 't screw astronauts , Donner . I just got in . Are you there , Donner ? I 'm here , Zoe . Mission control , I am in the air lock . Hatch is secure . – We copy that . Ted , you guys wanna get back in the corridor , you can re-pressurise now . – Copy that . How 's your pressure , Zoe ? I am at ... 24 ... 23.9 ... Guess what ? I am looking at Canis Major . I can see it . That would be ... a ... perfect Mirzam-Sirius arrangement , I think . – Yes , it would . – Much better than yours . Although , yours is pretty good . OK , I 'm gonna start puling you back in now . Sure as hell , beats ceiling sparklies . She 's gone from 5 to 2 atmospheres , in less than ten minutes . Her speech is starting to slur . – Nitrogen narcosis ? Yes . It time to start worrying about the bends . Donner , switch to private com two . She 's gettin ' a little loopy , isn 't she ? We have her on a normal air mixture for these tests . She 's getting the nitrogen build up in the blood , like she 's on a 50 meter scuba dive . – Well , I can handle her drunk . With depressurization , Claire worries she may be getting the bends . I 'll set up the hyperbaric chamber . – Can 't you guys give her a pressure bust ? – Negative Donner . That micro leak we have is getting bigger by the minute . You 're telling me pick up the pace a little bit , aren 't ya ? Do you feel like we 've been here , Donner ? I feel like we 've been here ... many many times before , you and me ... Zoe ... You should really conserve your air now . Is that ... a euphemism for " shut up " ? I need you to conserve your air , Zoe . I did not pull the eject lever . I know you didn 't . Stop talking . Oh , it was a euphemism . Euphemism . Get her out of the suit as fast as we can , and then we get her into the chamber . – Get off your ass and do something ! – What ? Tell me what to do , and I 'll do it . She 's down to about 10 P.S.I. Her interior suit will keep the pressure up , but she 's only got three minutes of air . That 's not enough time to get her in . The floor 's open . Ideas , people ? She 'll have roughly five minutes , after losing consciousness before sustaining brain damage . It might be enough time . What about spit , Arnel ? – Is that you , Wass ? – Yeah , yeah . Can she spit ? A thick one might slow a micro leak considerably at that pressure . And it would ... find the hole on its own . – Couldn 't hurt . – Anything 's worth a shot . You get that , Donner ? Copy on the lugi . Zoe , you think you can spit for me ? Spit ? Yea . Spit . Hack a lugi . Big one . Right down in your suit . Are you making fun of me ? No , I 'm not . I am serious . I need you to hack a big one . Rollie ... Is he making fun of me ? – Zoe , do it . – How big ? – Big as you can . Right now . Do it . Come on . Right now . Come on . It 's slowing . It 's slowing . Holding at 7 . Oh , my God . Wow ! Very impressive , Steven , but truly disgusting . Oh , thank you ! There is a reason he 's on this mission . Donner , get her back inside before she gets the bends . Roger that . I was a pretty decent athlete as a kid . Hoops , soccer , baseball . When it came to choosing up sides , I was almost always picked first . That leads to a certain arrogance . It 's an expectation ... You perform well , you win . Cause and effect . I always knew you 'll be here . Doesn 't always prepare you well for being an adult . Schilling . Stellar . Pass . Barnes . Pass . Wassenfelder . I 'll send that boy back tomorrow . I want him passed . He can 't swim . Teach him . Life , isn 't always fair ... I don 't understand . I am part of this team . I am so sorry , A.J. Failure can be rewarded ... We 'll find something for you in research . Merit can be looked at like a disease ... Sometimes , I think the only natural selection happens in a Petri dish . But ... if it 's in a Petri dish , that 's not really natural , isn 't it ? No answers in the hatch blowing . She didn 't do it . We are lucky we found that leak today and not on Venus . Yea . Freaky lucky . So , the question is ... who or what is it that 's picking the teams ? And why can results seem so unfair and so painful ? I have no answers . All I know is , if they pick you first , you better come through ... And you never , ever , ever ... pull the damn eject lever . by Dobrivoje , Siban and friends from

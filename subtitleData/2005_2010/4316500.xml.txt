 The world will have to deal with us . " Previously on " The " 4400 : " You 're so sweet . I wish I could take you with me when I go , but I can 't . So yesterday , a few patients were compelled to work on this thing . And today , it 's the entire hospital . If we get Tess out of here , do you think this compulsion will fade ? I 'm injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum . I will have taught my body how to produce promicin . And then I will be the first non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities . Enough running , Dr. Burkhoff . You need to come with us now . No . Stay back . I don 't wanna hurt anyone . That 's very reassuring . We 'll keep that in mind . No ! No ! No ! Mr. Tyler . Come in . What can I do for you ? I wanted to ask you about your work with the students here . Sure . I teach three classes . - History , arts and ... - I 'm not talking about your teaching . I was talking about the counseling that you do . I understand you use your ability with the kids . That 's right . My ability is to help them focus their abilities . It 's pretty much what I 've been doing ever since I came back . If a student has a talent , like all of our kids here do , I help them learn how to use it . Gain control of it . Build their confidence . Does it work with adults ? It didn 't use to , but I haven 't tried it since I 've been off the inhibitor . Why ? I developed this ability a few months ago . Telekinesis . What a word . I can 't even say it with a straight face . - Oh , that 's fantastic . - I 've just been pretending it isn 't there . I mean , I know a little bit about it . So far , it only works with inanimate objects . Little stuff . And when I 'm mad or excited , I can do a lot more with it . And you 're looking to control it when you 're calm ? Yeah . That 's why I 'm here , I guess . How many times do I have to go over this with you people ? I have not been injecting promicin into anyone but myself . You 're certain of that ? You 're a world-class scientist . I find it difficult to believe you wouldn 't build a redundancy plan into your experiment . This isn 't your basic sleep study . I mean , look at me . Do you think I 'd have an easy time finding volunteers ? No , I do not . You look like you 're in quite a bit of discomfort to me . Yes . - As a matter of fact , I am . - Well , you can relax now . The experiment 's over . This will only hurt a minute . Bag him . We 'll take him back for the autopsy . Get Dr. Burkhoff up there quickly . We promised results by the morning . Mommy ? Mommy ? Mom ? Are you okay ? Of course , sweetie . I 'm fine . Why wouldn 't I be ? I had a bad dream . You were in it . Well , why don 't you get in and tell me about it ? You turned into a monster . It was horrible . It seemed so real . It was you , but you were different . What kind of a monster ? Nice . Something for the refrigerator door ? You don 't think there 's anything to this ? It 's not a prediction , right ? Just a bad dream . Well , I hope so . But when your daughter is a precog , you don 't want her giving you a picture like this . Hello , this is Skouris . Well , thank you for calling me back . - Let me know if you see him , all right ? - Everything okay ? Maybe . I 'm not sure . I mean , that was the 4400 Center . I was hoping maybe they 'd seen Dr. Burkhoff . I stopped by his apartment yesterday , and he wasn 't home . Diana , why would you be stopping by Dr. Burkhoff 's apartment ? You actually saw the wound in Kevin 's hand heal over ? Yes . He pulled the scalpel out , and it was gone within seconds . He 's developing an ability . I mean , he 's close to it anyway . He says it comes and goes . What ? Anyone else developing a 4400 ability I should know about ? - I should have told you earlier . - You 're damn right you should have . Gotta hand it to you , Diana . Some people play racquetball in their spare time , maybe collect old records , but you , you play Igor to the one man who ... Well , if he has developed an ability like you say , maybe he really is the father of 4400 technology . Just like the future predicted . Are you two the only ones who know about this experiment ? I thought we were . And now I 'm not so sure . And that 's what I 'm worried about . Tom , what if someone else finds out what he 's up to ? Well , if he succeeds , we could be talking about the mass marketing of 4400 abilities . I 'm sure a lot of people would like to keep that genie in the bottle . Make our jobs even easier . Are you ... ? Are you okay ? Yeah , it 's just my allergies . They 're acting up . I 've already spoken to his family . They haven 't heard from him in months . Okay , so who else is he close to ? " ' I didn 't know that Cheshire cats always grinned . In fact , I didn 't know cats could grin , " said Alice very politely . " ' You don 't know much , " said the duchess . " And that 's a fact . " We 'll finish this chapter tomorrow . I hope you all can make it . I 've been living in a halfway house for about three months . And I got this job here two weeks ago . Well , that 's great , Tess . So they found a medication that works for you ? Well , so far , so good . I still have my disease . Schizophrenia never goes away . But I haven 't had any symptoms for a while . Hopefully , I won 't . So these kids you 're reading to , they 're not going to try and build a tower to contact the future , are they ? I don 't think so . I can barely remember all that now . I 'm still not sure how I could compel people to work or why they put those blueprints in my head . I 'm glad it made Kevin better . But it was still so weird . That 's actually why we 're here . Have you been in touch with Kevin lately ? No . I called him when I first got out of the institution , but ... We met for coffee ... I haven 't seen him in months . Is he okay ? Well , we 're not sure , but we 'd like to talk to him . So if he contacts you , would you let us know ? Of course . When you find him , will you have him call me ? Sure . It 's nice to see you again , Tess . - Bye . - Bye . I just spoke with the program coordinator . She says the first segment will be interviews with some of the people you 've healed . And then they 'll bring you out after the break . She says the emotional stuff also plays well with her audience , so feel free to cry or ... We 'll see about that . They 're also kind of curious about the wedding . She 'd love it if you answered some questions . Let 's keep the private life private , okay ? Nick ! Nick , please wake up ! Nick ! Nick , please wake up ! Jesus , that 's Nick Crowley . Oh , my God . You 're that 4400 . The one with the hands . Help him , please ! Nick ! Nick , wake up , please . - Is he all right ? - If you 're okay , say something . Well , Jim Morrison says hello . Easy , easy , boys , easy . Coming up ... You just saved Nick Crowley . On behalf of millions of rock ' n ' roll burnouts all over the world , allow me to thank you . Any time you wanna lay these on me , you just let me know . It was a little bit big , so I just had it resized . It 's perfect now . I think Mom would be really happy , don 't you ? Lily gave you that ring . I guess you can do what you want with it . I think it 's perfect . So have you thought about what you 're going to say at the wedding ? Usually , the father of the bride gives a toast . Well , it 's all been so sudden . I haven 't had much time to really plan it yet . That 's okay . I have a few thoughts . There 's an article in this magazine on toasts . Read it . I think I can handle that on my own . Dad , I want you to read it . Tonight . Hi . I bought some food . Let me help you with that . Thank you . My joints are a little stiff . Kevin , why did you put your hood up when I came in ? You shouldn 't have to look at me like this . Like what ? Diana Skouris and Tom Baldwin came by the bookstore today . They were asking about you . I figured Diana would be worried . How did she look ? Okay , I guess . A little sick . Kevin , I felt bad seeing her . I don 't like what we 're doing to her . - What I 'm doing to her . - I don 't like it much either . But we are on the cusp of changing the world for the better . We have to keep going , even if it gets ugly . Kevin , it 's already ugly . Someone shot you yesterday . I know . But the experiment is worth the risk . They woke me up to do this . You woke me up to do this . I have to move forward . And to do that , I need Diana . And I need you . Is Shawn Farrell around ? I have something for him . I played that when we were recording my first album . I 've been holding on to it for years . You 're really giving this to me ? You saved my life . Seems like a fair trade to me . So this ability of yours . It works every time out of the gate ? Yeah , pretty much . Oh , my God . I wish they 'd brought you back 15 years ago . Career in rock ' n ' roll ... Sometimes it feels like you 're living in a war zone . You lose a lot of people along the way . One day you look up , and you 're the last man standing . You should take better care of yourself . I 'm not always around . I feel like I owe you more than a guitar . We 're playing tomorrow night , and I wanted to invite you backstage . You can hang out , watch the show from the wings . - Really ? - Sure . I figure it 'll be handy having you around . If I keel over , you can always come out and do your hands of God thing for an encore . It 's cold . You should bring your jacket . She didn 't say anything on the way over ? Of course not , Kevin . She hardly ever does . You 're so brave . I always wanted to give it to you first . I thought you deserved an ability . I 'm sorry it has to happen without your permission . Can we get this started ? Give Dr. Burkhoff your hand . Mommy , I 'm gonna be late for school if we don 't leave soon . I 'm sorry , baby . I slept through my alarm . I 'll be ready in a few ... Mommy , are you okay ? I 'm fine . I just broke a nail is all . Hi . Hey , Marco . What are you doing down here ? Tom asked me to check out Dr. Burkhoff 's computers . Are you okay ? - I heard you had the flu . - No . Hey , I thought you were taking a sick day . Everyone , please , stop treating me like a plague patient . I 'm fine . Have we learned anything here ? Dr. Burkhoff 's computers are clean . Like , completely clean . I mean , there 's no saved files , no records of anything . It 's like someone took out his hard drives and swapped them for new ones . - So either he took them somewhere ... - Or someone else has them . Diana look at this . Is that Kevin ? Yeah . My God , these are the side effects of the injections ? I haven 't seen him in a couple of weeks . I had no idea he 'd gotten so bad . So who drew this ? You think it 's a self-portrait ? No way . Kevin 's hands weren 't steady enough to make coffee . Didn 't Tess like to draw ? I feel like I 'm in a staring contest . It 's okay . I know it can be a little awkward at first . So sometimes when I 'm having trouble getting started with a student , I 'll take their hand . It helps everything get rolling . You up for it ? Yeah . I guess . Just relax , okay ? I 'm sorry , I ... To be honest , I felt a little awkward . I haven 't had someone touch me like that since my wife passed . It 's okay . Sometimes it takes more than one session to make headway . Diana ? Diana ? Should I just call you a cab ? I can handle this if you want . No , I 'm okay . Any sign of Tess ? No , she hasn 't come out yet . Look , Tom , I made an appointment with the doctor tomorrow morning . But for now , I 'd just like to stick with it , okay ? I have to say , this does not feel like the flu . It 's like I 'm dragging myself around . Here she is . Come in . Hey . What ? Different look for you . New look ? I dressed like this for ten years . Hey , you 're not here to ask about the wedding , are you ? I am officially taking the night off from all planning . This has nothing to do with the wedding , unless Nick Crowley 's invited . He 's downstairs . Really ? I 'm getting ready for his show . Maybe he wants to give me a ride or something . I don 't think that 's it . Well , what ? I never get enough refills . I mean , look at me . - Where is he staying ? - What 's he saying ? Nick has a prescription for Antabuse . They 're these pills that are supposed to help him cut back on his drinking . He finally tried some . I guess he overdid it , huh ? It 's the same thing he does with everything . He insisted on coming here instead of the hospital . Continue medicine for me . Do your worst . Please ? Come to my arms , my beamish boy . Lay down . Lay down . You 're my little lifeline . Kevin . Dr. Burkhoff , I 've been worried about you . What are you doing hiding up here ? My God , look at you . Dr. Burkhoff , you need to come with us . We 're gonna get you some help . I can 't do that . People are trying to kill me . What people ? Who 's trying to kill you ? I think they work for the government . No , they don 't work for NTAC . Are you sure about that ? Because I 'm not . Listen , Kevin , you know us . If you come in , we 'll protect you . Besides , I 'm not taking no for an answer . Come on . Actually , I think you 're going to have to . - Diana , what the hell are you doing ? - I don 't know , Tom . I 'm sorry . Diana is not quite herself right now . She 'll do whatever Tess tells her to . Tess , would you get his gun , please ? Please . I am so close to finishing . Stop trying to find me . I have no desire to hurt you . Diana . Are you okay ? You all right ? I don 't know . What happened ? You pulled your gun on me . - Tess . - Yeah . - Oh , God . - What ? Something 's wrong . I feel weird . Oh , my God . What are those ? They 're lesions . They 're just like the ones Kevin had when he started taking promicin . We need to get you to NTAC medical . We want him brought in unharmed . If there 's anything at all to these experiments Dr. Burkhoff has been conducting , a lot of people in D.C. Are gonna want to look over his notes . These pictures have already been circulated to local law enforcement . We 're gonna distribute them around the neighborhood near Dr. Burkhoff 's apartment and the vacation home where he was hiding . - Maybe we 'll get lucky . - So , what ? We tell people there 's some kind of monster on the loose ? No , if anyone asks , we tell them Dr. Burkhoff has Werner 's syndrome . - It 's a rare wasting disease . - Okay . You think we 're gonna be able to bring this guy in safe and sound ? I mean , some cowboy cop sees this stumbling towards him , you don 't think he might shoot first and ask questions later ? That 's why we have to get to him first . Whatever Dr. Burkhoff is guilty of , he saved thousands of lives during the inhibitor scandal . Look , the good thing about his condition is it shouldn 't make him too hard to spot . I don 't know . They 're nice hands , but they don 't look magical or anything . Making friends already ? - Hey . - Oh , you 've chosen wisely . I speak from experience . The show was amazing . - Thank you so much for having me . - What are you thanking me for ? The show would have been canceled if not for you . Listen , I just had the best idea during the encore . Why don 't you come out on the road with us ? And do what ? Well , you could start with Mischa , and work your way onward from there . Okay , yeah , it 's tempting , but I kind of have a lot on my plate here in Seattle , you know ? I 'm supposed to be getting married soon . Well , in that case , you have to come with us . It 'll be like an extended bachelor party . He 'll take good care of you . Promise . And a promise from Mischa is money in the bank . Besides , I like having you along with us . You keep me limber . - You mean upright . - Oh , yeah , that too . I don 't ... I 'm not your personal physician , you know ? Of course you 're not . You 're a hell of a lot better than any doctor I 've ever met . Think about it , but not too long . What 's to think about ? Who could say no to all of this ? So , what can I get you this morning ? Could I have the steak and eggs ? Could you make the steak extremely rare ? Thanks . Dr. Burkhoff was spotted at a diner in Beacon Hill . He 's there right now . Bring him in quietly if you can , but bring him in . Diana , wake up . Dr. Anapurn . I thought I was supposed to sleep . You gave me drugs . You 're being discharged . You need to come with me . I don 't know . I guess he left about 15 minutes ago . Did he say where he was headed ? No . I mean , he didn 't even touch the food he ordered , right ? He just left in a hurry . He left a good tip though . Where are we going ? Thank you . You can go back to your office now . - Tess , don 't do this . - I 'm sorry . I wish it didn 't have to be you , but there 's no one else . We better go . He 'll be waiting for us . How could I have done that ? I don 't remember any of it . Diana doesn 't remember going to Kevin 's apartment at night either . If Dr. Burkhoff 's willing to break her out of here , he must be getting desperate . Feels like he 's running out of time . He has to complete the experiment . He 's gonna up her dosage . If we don 't find Diana soon , she 's gonna wind up in the same shape as Kevin . I think it 's the silence that 's messing us up . It 's too awkward . So instead of us just staring at each other , I thought we 'll talk . Okay . Something specific you want to talk about ? No . You pick . Well , I 've been thinking about my parents a lot lately . What they 'd think of all this . This place . Me . Sitting here trying to figure out how to use my ... Telekinetic ability ? You know , you can say it out loud . It 's nothing to be embarrassed about . Yeah , you can say that , but when I first got back , I was a 4400 , but I didn 't have an ability . I felt normal . It was something I could hold onto . Now you have to get used to the idea that you 're special . Is that what my parents would think if they were here ? Or would they just think that their son had become a freak ? Richard , when you got taken , you were one of the first black pilots in all of the military . You were at the vanguard . Now you 're part of a different vanguard . There 's a reason they picked you . I think your parents would be proud . Yeah ? Maybe that 's true . Richard ? Well , I guess that worked , huh ? This will be fine . We can work here for a while . Tell him he can go home . Please , you gotta help me . Say something . Don 't bother . He 's not going to remember any of this . Thank you . You can go home now . Kevin , can I get you some water ? No . - I 'm fine . - Kevin , you 're dying . You 're killing yourself , and now you 're gonna kill me too . No . You will not die . My work is valid . Are you sure ? Look at yourself . If it isn 't working in me , the fault isn 't with the experiment . It 's with me . All those years of shock treatments , the fistfuls of medications . They must have changed me . I 'm not a good subject . There is no good subject . Kevin , you 're brilliant , but you 're wrong . You failed , and you 're not thinking clearly enough to see that . My mind is not compromised . We are at a point , Diana , where it would be easy for the timid to turn back . We have to be braver than that . And if necessary I 'm prepared to be brave enough for both of us . Working on a song ? The end of one . Can 't nail it though . Inspiration . What ? Are you shocked I 'm drinking my lunch ? - I didn 't say anything . - Good . - Because ... - Listen ... This here is called maintaining a base level . It 's kind of scary , actually . Shawn , don 't worry . I 've made a solemn vow not to overindulge , unless , of course , you 're around . Yeah , that 's kind of the thing . You 're not going to be around , is that it ? You 're not coming on the road ? I wanted to . It 's just ... I mean , even if it was for a little while . This gift I have , though , it 's kind of a responsibility , you know ? And I don 't mean to be harsh , man , but I don 't think it was meant to be used as a rock star 's personal safety net . You don 't know that . Maybe they sent you back to keep me alive so I could finish my album . Nick , if you go down again I can 't be there for you . There 's still time , you know . We can save him . I think maybe you don 't have enough faith in Kevin . He can do this . He 's special , that 's why they had me wake him up . Tess , I packed an adrenaline shot when we left the cabin . - Have you seen it ? - No . I need it . It has to be here in case I slip under . Kevin ? I think I got stung by a bee . What is this ? Don 't move , Dr. Burkhoff ! - Tess . - There 's nowhere to go . We 've got this place surrounded . Nobody fires . He 's not going anywhere . Hey , Diana . Are you all right ? Tom . Hold still , Burkhoff . Put your hands up . Burkhoff ! They won 't be able to hide for long . Tess will run out of meds . Dr. Burkhoff 's not exactly inconspicuous . They 'll show themselves , we 'll find them . You mean we 'll find Tess . Doesn 't sound like Dr. Burkhoff 's gonna live out the week . I don 't get it . He was supposed to be the father of 4400 technology . That 's why they woke him up . Well , that 's just our theory . Maybe you 're putting too much faith in the future . Diana 's okay ? Yeah , she 'll get there . She 's down in NTAC medical . You got us a ride . Someone let me borrow them . Mr. Ryland wants a status report on the promicin . We 're good . Great , actually . We have enough of a stockpile to last us for almost two years .

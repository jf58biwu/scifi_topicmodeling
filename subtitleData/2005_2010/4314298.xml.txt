 We are not a threat we are salvation the world will have to deal with us Previously on the 4400 ... you know those visions that maia used to have ? It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped . How long have you known ? Not long . I only found out because I read her diary . You 're one of those 4400 guys . Huh ? One day . All of this will be yours . But you 're not going anywhere . Whatever you do . Shawn . Don 't reveal your healing ability . Because if you heal one of them . You 'll have to heal them all . I 'm blacking out . If you 're losing chunks of time . You should talk to your dad about it . What 's he going to do . Turn me over to ntac medical ? Can I help you ? Heidi . It 's mommy . Who ? That 's okay . Sweetie . I got it . She 's my daughter . She doesn 't know that . She thinks carol is her mother . Brian . look . I need your help . Richard . He 's been arrested . Okay . I 'll make a few calls and do whatever I can . Hello . Richard . I want you to come home . If I 'm lying . Isabelle will punish me accordingly . If isabelle accepts me . Well . Then I can offer you and lily and the child a new life . Let her judge me . Hush-a-bye . Hush-a-bye go to sleep little baby when you wake I 'll give you cake and all the pretty little horses and go to sleep-y little baby who 's a special girl ? Is isabelle a special girl ? Is she ? Come here . Look at him with isabelle . This keeps up . We 're going to have to start calling him " uncle jordan . " There 's something so wrong about that . Isn 't there ? A week ago . He was the one guy we were trying to keep away from her . - And now it 's like ... - they 've bonded . She 's really taken to him . Is that the couple of the hour ? Hi . Richard . What 's up . Man ? It 's good to see you . Look at you . Oh . You look great . You look great . So how long do you guys think you 're going to be staying ? We 're not sure . Collier said we could stay at the center till we get back on our feet . Did he get you squared away with ntac ? Started to . His lawyers took our statements . I guess we 're looking at back fines for not reporting in . Well . Hey . I 'm sure jordan will take care of it . He offered to . But I think we 're going to try and swing it ourselves . Well . Hey . You picked the right week to come . This reunion thing 's going to be big . Huh ? We 've got 4400s coming in from 27 different countries . Three more maybes . There haven 't been this many of us in the same place since quarantine . What 's happened since we left town ? I mean . Suddenly it seems like everyone 's dying to meet a real . Live 4400 . Yeah . Well . What happened ? Jordan happened . Welcome to the revolution . Little lady . Huh ? He 's going to die ! I saw it . He 's going to die . Sweetheart . Are you okay ? Did you have a nightmare ? No . I was awake . And I saw it . Tell us what you saw . That man we watched on tv once . What man ? Him . Jordan collier ? Someone 's going to kill him . - = YYETS = - Capture £ ºjohnsonh Sync £ ºp0000000 S02E05 As far as this department knew . Maia wasn 't having visions anymore . Right ? Well . She was keeping them secret from me and writing everything down in a diary . But I 'm not here to talk about my daughter . We 're here to talk about collier . We could talk about him all you want . But if I was collier . I 'd be bringing all my books back to the library . If you know what i 'm mean . The kid 's never wrong . Right ? Look . As far as I can tell . Maia has two kinds of visions . If she can see an event clearly enough in her head . She can sometimes influence the course of the future . But mostly her visions are abstract . They 're more like ... certainties . Prophecies . I guess you could call them . Now . This is one of those . And as far as I can tell . They 're never wrong . Well . Not yet . Anyway . But nobody 's made a concerted effort to stop one of them from happening . So we could always offer collier a suite in the basement . 24-hour surveillance . And a food taster . Sure . We just tell the guy he needs to stay isolated for what . A week ? A year ? When it comes to the prevention of future crime . There are no time limits ... and everyone 's a suspect . I mean . Literally everyone . So how to stop the inevitable from happening ? Stopping the inevitable ... isn 't that what we deal with every day ? I mean . That 's why the 4400 were sent back . Right ? I like the " can-do " attitude . But I have to ask ... do we even want to save collier ? Well . He is kind of the bad guy . Maybe that 's the way the future wants it . Unless they gave us this message as a way to stop collier 's death from happening . Fascinating . What an extraordinary gift . You are clear on what we 're telling you ? Your daughter has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future . Her latest visión involves my death . I leave anything out ? No . That about covers it . Ntac is offering you all its resources . That means round-the-clock protection . Threat assessment and I 'm meant . Of course . To isolate myself ? Well . That would be the safest move . Let 's say I 'm willing to assume good faith on your part ... which . Given your exploitation of the 4400 to get to me . Is rather generous ... what . You think we made this up ? I 'm not sure you 're that creative . But your plan does call for my total withdrawal from the public eye and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest in the 4400 that 's been months in the planning . Our history with each other is what it is . But this is real . And denial is not a luxury you can afford . Thank you for the information . I 'll keep it in mind . Maia is never wrong . Whatever protection you can afford me . I can afford myself . Pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out . The foreign returnees ' stories are particularly inspirational . Still come here every thursday . Huh ? Thought I might get lucky . Lily . What are you doing here ? I 'm back in seattle . I just wanted to thank you for helping richard . Just a couple of phone calls . It was no big deal . We were in a bad spot . You did what you could . It meant a lot . Well . You really didn 't have to get me anything . It 's actually for heidi . Her birthday 's coming up . Oh . Lily ... it 's just a cool little handbag . You don 't have to tell her it 's from me . I don 't want to mess with your life . Brian . I 'm just trying to say " thank you . " Okay . You 're looking well . Lily . I 'm glad things are working out . I can 't talk to first keys today . There 's too much going on with this party . But class starts in 10 minutes . I can 't do it . Lucy . You 're just going to have to tell them to think of it as a study hall . Um ... this is outgoing . Thank you . You guys come for the tour ? Could we talk to you outside ? Kind of a bad day . It 's pretty crazy around here . Told you he 'd blow us off . What 's up ? Oh . Liv . They were too embarrassed to come inside . I can 'T . I can 'T . But I saw what you can do . We all did . You can heal people . Listen . It 's not that simple . I can 't heal everyone . I 'm not asking you to heal everyone . Just them . You don 't understand . It 's like it drains me . I can do it for maybe one . Maybe . One is better than none . And who chooses that one . Way ? You ? Me ? I can 't heal the world . I 'm sorry . What 'd I tell you ? Waste of time ... don 't look at me like that . Kyle ? Hey . You with us . Buddy ? What ? I thought you were ... you know . Elsewhere . No . I 'm right here with you . Was just thinking . Relax . I haven 't had one of those blackouts in a couple of days . I 'm hoping that 's all done . Yeah . I do too . But I still think you should tell your dad about it and get yourself checked out . You want to go with me to see the kills ? Okay . So we 're ignoring the whole blackout thing . Or ... pretty much . They go on at 8 : 00 . You should come . The tsa is putting a flag on ian dravitt and his known associates . They 'll call us if anyone shows up in seattle . This whole dravitt thing is just collier 's latest deal gone south . Collier had his name on the side of a skyscraper by the time he was 30 . You pursue power that ruthlessly . You pick up some enemies along the way . So we find the one who seems most like john hinckley or sirhan sirhan . And then do what ? Follow him around for the rest of his natural life ? We could spend the next year looking at collier 's moves since he founded the center . The guy had a whole career before he got abducted . Or maybe it is coming from someone who collier 's never met . I mean . If you hate the 4400 . Killing their figurehead 's a good way to make them suffer . But what are we supposed to do ? The potential victim has refused our help . No one said stopping the future was going to be easy . Diana . look at this . His name is miles quinlan . Claims collier bankrupted him . Then kicked him out of the center . Lives with his parents What . Nursing a persecution complex ? Pretty much a póster boy for the lone gunman theory . Come on . Maia . I 've named every guy I 've dated for like the last five years . Are you telling me I don 't have a future with any of them ? I wouldn 't worry about it . Seems like you meet a lot of boys . Yeah . Well . That 's the trouble . I 'm tired of meeting boys . I want to meet a man . You will . When ? Aunt april . Just because I don 't see it doesn 't mean it 's not going to happen . Oh . That 's probably mrs . Bradshaw from upstairs . She 's going to watch you tonight while I go to work . I 'm sorry . It 's not my fault . You recognize me . You 're jordan collier . I didn 't mean to frighten her . I just wanted to talk to her for a minute . Yeah . Well . Doesn 't look like that 's going to happen . She believes I 'm going to die . Please give her my apologies . I brought this for her . I hope she doesn 't already have one . Thanks . Hi . I 'm lily tyler . - I think someone was asking for me - - excuse me . Heidi ... are you my mother ? I heard them fighting about you . My mom and dad ... carol . It 's okay that I still call her " mom . " right ? I know it 's confusing . Baby . Just ' cause they 're talking in the other room doesn 't mean I can 't hear them . They said you were one of the 4400 . That 's why I was gone . That 's why we don 't know each other . Didn 't you come to our house once ? It 's the first thing I did when I got back . I wanted to see you . But your dad and I. We weren 't sure it was a good idea . Sweetie . Does your father know you came down here ? No . I didn 't tell them I heard . I didn 't go to school today . I came here instead . I 'm glad you did . Was it hard for you not to see me ? It was the hardest thing I 've ever had to do . I think about you every single day . Look at this . Is that me ? That was the day we brought you back from the hospital . You look the same as you do now . I was gone so long . But ... to me ... this feels like yesterday . You want to talk about collier ? He uses people up and leaves them on the curb . Is that why you left the center ? I didn 't leave . They threw me out . That 's what happens when you run out of money . They have all these different levels . They call them keys . Right ? You make seventh key . You 're unlocked . " Unlocked " ... meaning you 've got your own 4400 ability ? Well . That 's the big prize . Only they set it up so no one ever gets there . There 's mid-levels and side seminars you have to pass . If you 're not one of the 4400. each one costs . First I ate up my savings . Then I cashed out the equity in my house . And they didn 't deliver . Soon as the first check bounced . They told me I 'd reached maximum potential and sent me on my way . Is that why you applied for a handgun permit ? We ran a vicap check on you this morning . So I bought a gun . So what ? I need to protect myself from collier . Yeah . Well . I hope self-defense is all you have in mind . Because if you 're planning anything else . We will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center . You want something to be paranoid about ? Think about that . You 're simplifying the issue . Canceling the gala is no guarantee of my safety . It 's a start . Jordan . You just told me there 's a little girl out there who can see the future and she saw you dead . It 's time to make yourself scarce . And where does it stop ? Do I stay away from the center ? I cut myself off from our work ? Yeah . If it means staying alive . I am not going to become a hermit . That is not a win for us . Look . The center is significantly safer than it seems . Half the people you see in workmen 's uniforms are bodyguards . Are you looking to die in public ? You 're developing a real flair for drama . You know . This is hanging over my head . Not yours . Look . I 'm sorry . Jordan . I 'm just - I am not ready to become a martyr . And you don 't have to be . I know you 've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time . Bringing all the 4400 together . It 's like a validation for everything you 've done so far . But if something happens to you . It could undo everything that we 've started . The movement 's not ready for you to be a martyr . Either . Just go . Go . Where 'd you go ? I was about to have them page you . Richard . There 's someone I want to introduce to you . This is my daughter . Heidi . She came to the center to meet me . We 've been talking . Well . It 's very nice to meet you . I 'm richard tyler . I 'm married to lily your mother . She told me . It 's nice to meet you . Too . Is that ... isabelle . This is your half-sister . Don 't be scared . I 'm sorry . She must be hungry . It 's okay . I should probably get home anyway . Well . I hope I can see you again . I hope so . Too . Maybe next time I can hold isabelle . I bet we could make that happen . I 'll walk you out . No more cutting school . Okay ? What 's the matter ? All I 'm saying is he was taller than I pictured him . Well . Tall or short . Collier had no business showing up here . I totally agree . Di . I didn 't let him in . Aunt april likes tall boys . Oh . So you 're talking about men to my daughter ? She 's a child . It might have come up in passing . Hey . Mom ? How come you never go out on dates ? Well . I wouldn 't say never . But aunt april Goes out all the time . Well . I think your aunt 's an extreme example . How do I know which one is right ? Not many or lots ? I think that you should probably shoot for somewhere in the middle . I 'll try . But do dates always have to be with boys ? They 're so gross . You get used to them . Can we have this conversation . Like in two or three . Maybe 10 years ? What 's that ? Oh . A lady dropped it off today . Oh It 's a subpoena . What 's that ? Well . It 's when someone wants you to give them something . Who 's it from ? It 's from my bosses . What do they want ? Your diary . Kyle ! You okay . Man ? You didn 't have a drink . Did you ? Just diet coke . It 's really loud in there . Huh ? Yeah . But they 're great . Huh ? You want to go back in ? Come on . My buddy 's saving us a spot by the stage . Do you know what time it is ? What are you doing here ? Kyle ! Do you know what time it is ? What are you doing outside my apartment ? I don 't know . I was at the pub . You 're scaring me . How long have you been out here ? I don 't know ... I think I was digging or something . Look . Kyle . I think you should go . - We can talk about this - - I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . It just happened again . Let me in . Get your hands off of me ! You don 't understand . He 's a fraud . All of you . Do you hear me ? Your golden boy is a big fraud . Liv . You need to calm down . It 's okay . Guys . I got it . My whole life . I have been looking for just one thing . Just one thing to believe in . I thought it was you . How long ago did you get high ? You gonna help me up . Or what ? Are you going to stop yelling at me ? I am done with you altogether . Go back to your penthouse . Pretend we don 't exist . Everyone else does . Why not you ? Listen ... easy . I 'm not going to sen d youoff into the night like this . You can sleep on my couch . I got you . It 's okay . You started all this . You know . Everything around you took shape after you showed me where to go . I don 't know what to do . Though . I could count the number of times I 've said that on one hand . But right now it 's true . That 's right . If you know anything ... now would be a good time to tell uncle jordan . Huh ? Oh ... thank you . Thank you . The reunion goes forward . Diana . One of dravitt 's hired guns flew into town last night . His name is laurent ganning . Tsa had his alias flagged . Well . Do we have a present whereabouts ? He just checked into a motel in first hill under the name " lawrence gawain " It 's clear . Tom ... he 's on the move . Wendy . Wait . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . You were waiting in the hallway outside my apartment last night . Do you know how weird that is ? I don 't know how I got there . Please . Believe me . L - l - I had another blackout last night . Look . Kyle . This is getting bad . And I can 't give you the kind of help that you need . So you want me to just go away ? No . I ... I want you to talk to someone . Someone qualified . I 'm scared for you . Scared for me or scared of me ? And we are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests . Many of whom risked so much to be here today ... you know . Glen . I 'm getting some nasty echos . Can we adjust the levels on the speakers in the back ? Testing . Testing . One . Two . Three . Testing . You know . That 's a lot better . Nobody moves ! Everyone stay right where you are . Don 't move . Don 't move ! Get your hands on your head . Get them up . Turn around . Turn around ! Get down . Down . Down ! Ganning 's pistol was made from synthetic polymers . The bullets . Too . He walked it right through your metal detectors without so much as a peep . You were Round to get him . He never would have killed me . He was standing two feet away from you with a loaded firearm . The whole thing was put in motion by maia . Your daughter 's visión was a gift to me . A prescription . If you will . For changing the future . In one chain of events . Ganning 's bullet killed me . I can only assume that somebody has a different plan for me . Well . I wouldn 't be putting my feet up by the fire just yet . I have no intention of canceling the extra security measures . The same extra measures that just allowed an assassin to walk right up to you . Would ntac like a presence at the gala tomorrow ? Yes . Mr. Collier . We don 't stand off to the side and watch . We take command . I 'll issue credentials . That was a rather dramatic demonstration of competence just now . What time is it ? It 's about 2 : 00 . How 'd I end up here . Anyway ? Liv . You were pretty far gone last night . But are you really telling me you don 't remember ? I remember . You don 't have to hover over me . I 'm not going to steal anything . The maid can come in and clean the couch as soon as I 'm gone . How many of these nights do you think you have left in you ? Hopefully not too many . You 've seen my life . When I O. D ... It 's not gonna be any big loss . That is not true . How 's it going to change ? I used to feel the same way . I meant what I told you . I can 't save the whole world . And I can 't even save your friends . And I 'm sorry . But if you 're serious about wanting a change . Maybe I can save you . How ? By giving you the same thing that saved me . He 's here . Hi . Good to see you . Excuse me . Hello . My love . Here we go . I think I have to ... nice to meet you Pleasure to see you . Excuse me . Sir . All the guestscheck out so far . Yeah . We secured the surrounding rooftops . Did a bomb sweep . So now it 's cross-our-fingers time . Yeah . Good afternoon . Thank you for coming to the center . We have a great day planned for you . But before we get started . I 'd like to thank the man that made this all possible . I mean that literally ... he didn 't just pay for the food . He built this place . And this movement . So I 'd like you to please welcome my mentor . My friend ... mr . Jordan collier . Thank you . And thank you . Shawn . For that introduction . We are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests . Many of whom risked so much to be here today . Let 's go . I just want to hear what the man has to say for himself . Jordan ? He 's up there ! Go ! Everybody stay down ! We 've got a shooter . Everyone calm down ! Just stay down . Stay down ! We 've got a shooter . Let me go . Jordan ! Oh . My god ! Oh . God ... please let me go . Please ! Get that stretcher ready . Pulse is weak and thready come on let 's go harry up ! Breathing 's stopped . We 're losing him again . No ! You 're not going anywhere yet . Shawn ! She told me to go through with it . Who did ? She lies . No ... don 't go anywhereno ... - Lily . I need to - - brian . I don 't have much time . I did not violate our agreement . Heidi found me . Lily . Heidi 's sick . She 's in the hospital . It happened yesterday . Something with her spleen . They had to operate right away . Is she okay ? Can I see her ? She 's okay . She 's still recovering from the anesthesia . She 's been asking for you . She 's still in recovery now . But carol thinks it 's all right if you want to get in there tomorrow . Brian . What happened ? Her spleen ? She 's 12 years old . It just ruptured . Her doctors said they 've never seen anything like it . Even they can 't tell us why . Where you been ? The funeral 's about to start . Lily . What 's wrong ? What is it ? Heidi 's sick . And I think isabelle 's responsible . I think they 're ready for you . You are going to read a lot about jordan collier in the next few weeks . Some of it good . A lot of it bad ... I will be ignoring all of it . Just like jordan would have . Because jordan may have used the media . But he never allowed himself to be seduced by it . I could tell you how much I owe the man . He took me in when I was feeling lost and alone . Confused . I 'm sure many of you have similar stories . The fact is that everyone alive today . Whether they know it or not . Owes jordan collier . He had a visión to save the future . And he gave us that visión . And now he won 't be here to see us achieve it ... but we will achieve it . I promise you . We will achieve it . We have all suffered a tremendous loss . We are heartbroken and bleeding on the inside . But we will not let that stop us . And I will not let that stop me . We will honor jordan collier . And we will create the better future that he died building . Thank you for coming . Goodbye . Nice words . Shawn . I think collier would have approved . Yeah . I hope so . He would have liked that you came . Oh . I don 't think I was that high on his radar . Don 't be too sure . You guys bumped heads . But you believed the same thing . That the 4400 are the key to the future . Your goals were identical . But our methods were different . Not as different as you think . See . That 's where your view of jordan collier splits from mine . Well . At least we have some common ground . Maybe your side and my side can work together now that I 'm assuming new duties around here . You 're becoming quite the little politician . Shawn . Now I know collier would have been proud of you . He 's gone . Is body . It 's not there . Someone stole the body . There 's only one way out . And we were standing right in front of it . Stole it how ? Then what happened ? All lying across the ground try not to make no sound to make or break you down I said to make or break you down I break all lying across the ground try not to make no sound to make or break you down I said to make or break you down I break I take down what I need 'cause you know I need to breathe I 'm tired of walking on another plane another plane ' cause I feel insane I step back to get to you cut back I 'm falling through another day I feel the same I 'm cutting and I 'm bleeding here with you

 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes . And you 've got to be ready . This programme contains some strong language . SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER OK ! Come on , Gwen ! LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING CONTINUES Gwen , this is for you , baby ! Come on ! Just get it off him ! Take if out of his hands ! Oi ! Oh , come to Daddy ! YES ! First round 's on you , boss . Girls , get your handbags ! Of course , that was an illegal move . Totally illegal ! Yeah , keep telling yourself that , yeah . Losers . Bye . He 's never seen a live rugby match ! I have other things to do with my time ! Rhys knows a bloke whose cousin works at the Millennium Stadium . We should all go to the next home international . Can you make it two Pepperoni Feasts tonight ? And a tub of coleslaw . My boss says I 'm not eating enough vegetables . Yeah , usual time . See you then . Good to see you again , sir . Are they looking after you at the hotel ? Konnichiwa , Tanizaki-san . Konnichiwa . I did all I could . I really did . My God ! It 's not possible ! One of them survived ! This is Lisa . Is she awake ? It 's just a reaction to the medication . She 's the only one left . Across the whole world . Thank you , thank you so much . Bringing me here . I never thought ... to get my chance ... .. to study ... to work with ... anything like this . Anyone ! Tell me , what happened ? She worked for Torchwood London . It was the end of the Canary Wharf battle . The Cybermen needed soldiers fast . They started upgrading whole bodies instead of transplanting brains using Earth technology . Lisa was halfway through the process when the machinery shut down . You found her ? Help ! Help me , please ! Somebody ! I pulled her out . Do you know the percentages ? The what ? Some elements have been augmented . Some are still human . Sensory capacity , for instance . Her breathing and hearing appears completely cybernetic . And yet ... there 's also bare flesh . Amazing . Perhaps 55 % augmentation with 45 % awaiting completion . Do you think ? Or perhaps , maybe 60 / 40 . It 's fascinating . Can you make her human again ? You took parts from a Cyber conversion unit and modified them into a life support for her ? How did you know what to do ? I told him . I thought you were resting . You should be resting . How 's the pain ? Are the new doses working ? A little . Oh ... Is this him ? I promised , didn 't I ? And you always keep your promises . I would like to ask her some questions . My name is Dr Tanizaki . I specialise in Cybernetics . Your friend , Mr Jones , asked me ... My boyfriend . Yes . He asked me to come . We agreed , together . Few simple questions . What is your name ? Lisa Hallett . How old are you ? 26 . What is the last thing you remember before coming here ? Somebody ! Anybody ! Pain . I remember my body burning with pain . You said ... there was somewhere I could work upstairs ? This first stage should enable her to breathe without the respirator . Once her body functions without support , I can judge what work is needed . What if she 's not ready to breathe on her own ? You must be prepared for her not to survive . Sometimes ... in order to save what we love , we have to risk losing it . MACHINES BEEP , HEART MONITOR FLATLINES She 's not strong enough ! Let me do my work ! And she said , " D 'you know how difficult it is to find a man in this city ? " He had a nice flat , all his own hair , so frankly , a couple of tusks , I can live with ! " PAGER BEEPS UFO sighting over Cardigan Bay . Seven calls to the emergency services . Oh ... Can we at least finish our drinks , please ? Sure . Take ten seconds . HEART MONITOR FLATLINES , LISA GASPS If she dies because of you ... SHE GASPS , HEART MONITOR BEEPS Ianto ? Yes , I 'm here ! She 's breathing ! It worked ! Why aren 't I connected ? You 're alive ! He kept you alive ! Thank you . This is only the start . COMPUTER BEEPS We 've gotta move . Quickly ! I 'll walk ! You 've only just woken up . You can 't . I want to walk ! Please . Help her downstairs . I 'll clear up here . I 'm alive . All I 'm saying is , once in a while , I 'd like to drive ! And all I 'm saying is no ! Why not ? ! Look , I 've shared cars with women before . I know what 'll happen . There 'll be an emergency , we 're all raring to go , I jump in , what do I find ? Seat 's in the wrong position , the rear view mirror 's out of line and the steering wheel 's in my crotch . Time it takes to sort it all out , aliens 'll have taken Newport . JACK LAUGHS What about a rota ? Different people drive on different days . We 're a secret organisation , hunting alien technology from an underground base . And you want a rota for who drives ? Just trying to help . As soon as they 're gone , I 'll be down . Tosh , call up the radar within a 50-mile radius of the Bay for the last six hours . Gwen , check with that man - Neil , I think his name was , voice like Sean Connery - at Jodrell Bank . See if they picked up any chatter around the time of the sightings . Owen , access the airspace provision over Cardigan Bay , also any RAF flightplans , see if it 's just a case of mistaken identity . Take it slowly . You 're still very weak . This way . HE CHOKES Is that Neil ? It 's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood . I know , we 're always after something , aren 't we ? Ianto ! Would you work some coffee magic ? Lisa ! Let me go ! I can help you . The human race is weak . I can make you strong . What 's happening ? Internal power drain . What 's causing it ? Something big to drain that amount of power . Tosh , run a system diagnostic . Actually ... We 've been having generator problems all evening . I was down there checking earlier . Couple of bits of cabling have come loose . I thought I 'd fixed it . Let me have another look . Fine . Go check . Want some help ? It 's fine . ALARM BLARES You 've got to shut down the power ! Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! What happened ? ! His upgrade failed . Was it an accident ? Tell me you didn 't do this ! I wanted to repay him for helping me . By removing the weaknesses of his humanity . What have you done ? ! You 've killed an innocent man ! It 's all right . It 's not all right ! They 're gonna come looking for me in a minute . If they see the body , if they find out what we 've been doing ... I can deal with them . Don 't you go near them ! You didn 't mean to do this . Something 's happened to your mind . Um ... just , um ... Some kind of side effect from this whole process . It 's post-traumatic . You didn 't mean to ... You 've ruined everything now ! How hard have we had to work to keep you alive ? And now you do this . I need you to stay in here . Rest . Don 't come out unless I tell you . This can 't happen again , Lisa . If you harm anyone else , I 'll ... Yes ? What will you do ? OK , the body . I 've got to deal with the body . I can do this . This is my fault ! I 'm responsible for this ! I 'll hide the body . Everything 's gonna be OK . That 's a UFO ? ! Only just ! Arkan leisure crawler , first generation . Collectors ' item , don 't see many of those around these days . Tosh , send a polite message saying great to see them , but could they please get the hell out of our atmosphere they 're spooking the locals . Done ! Shouldn 't we be apprehending it ? Investigating it ? Oh , please . You interrogate an Arkan , you 'll be in there for a month . And that 's just the first question . They are so boring . Besides , they 're mostly liquid , the cells would be a mess . There it goes again ! Ianto , we 've got another dose of darkness . You found anything ? ALARM BLARES Ianto ? I need to hear those beautiful Welsh vowels ! Power 's draining to the storeroom at the bottom of the building . Looking for human heat signals . We 've got ... Two signals ? So assuming one 's Ianto ... Who 's the other ? I 'm thinking we 're under attack . Security 's been breached . We assume battle protocols . That 's impossible ! Nobody can get in without triggering seven separate alarms . Yeah , well , looks like our system needs to be upgraded . I 'll head down and look for Ianto . I 'll come with you . You all right with that ? Keep your comms open at all times . Any doubts , shoot first . Priority is to find Ianto . I 'm sorry . What 's down here ? Normally ? Nothing . 'Progress report ? ' Signs of ... 'activity at the eastern end of the main corridor . ' We 're losing your comms signals . We 're going in to have a look . Whatever that power source is , it 's interfering with the comms . Gwen , Owen ? Can you hear me ? Damn ! Can we get them back ? Trying other channels . There 's something else you need to see . I 've gone back through our internal CCTV footage for the last couple of hours . Someone 's tried to remove the images from our system . See , now I 'm starting to get a little peeved . These people come into my house , start using my things ... I 've dug into the system memory . What the hell 's going on here ? ! Jack ? Tosh ? Gwen ? Owen ? Can you hear me ? No comms . We 're on our own , then . What the hell is going on ? What 's the matter ? I can 't see well enough . But there 's something in there . Some kind of operating table . Get the bolts . OK ? Yeah . OK , one , two ... No ! No , no , no , no ! What the hell is it ? ! It 's wrong . It 's beyond wrong ! It shouldn 't be here ! Turn the thing off ! TURN IT OFF ! Internal levels are being restored ! Gwen ? Owen ? Can you hear me ? COMMS CRACKLE These things brought down Torchwood One . But they were all destroyed . Why is there one in our bloody basement ? ! Just tell me what it does ! It 's the remnants of a conversion unit . This machinery turns humans into Cybermen . If I don 't hear something within 30 seconds , I 'm coming down there ! Jack , it 's Gwen . The comms dropped out . We 're back online now . 'Any sign of Ianto ? ' No . But we have found parts of a Cyber conversion unit . 'Fully powered up and working . ' This is no time to be kidding around , Owen . I 'm deadly serious ! I dunno why it 's here , or how it got here . But that 's what 's draining our power . Jack ? You there ? I want you two back up here immediately ! We still haven 't found ... Jack , code zero incursion . Repeat ! 'Code zero incursion . We 're under attack . ' If you don 't hear from me within 15 minutes , activate total shutdown procedures and get yourself to safety . But I can 't just leave you all here ! If there 's a Cyberman in this building , we need a last line of defence . Just make sure it never gets to the outside world . Whatever you ... Whoever you are ... I don 't mean you any harm . But come any closer , I 'll shoot . SHE CHOKES Let me go ! Do not struggle . You will be like me . GWEN CRIES IN PAIN Throw down any weapons , put your hands up and turn and face me ! GWEN SCREAMS You 're a woman ! Owen ! JACK ! GWEN SCREAMS She doesn 't know what she 's doing ! You are fighting the wrong guy ! Get me out of here , someone , please ! Switch it off ! I 'm trying ! She 's changed all the circuits ! Shut off the power everywhere ! Toshiko , cut all power in the base ! I do that , the base goes into lockdown ! We 'll be trapped . Just do it ! Switch it off ! Gwen ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Sort of . Jack , please get me out of here ! It 's all right . Where is she ? Where did she go ? Please tell me you got her ! Stand guard by the door . I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . What for ? Let 's just get out of here . Clear ? Clear . Oh , God , there she is . What is she ? Some form of Cyberman . They 're us , upgraded . Humans with emotions removed , created on a parallel world and supposedly destroyed on this one . What are we gonna do ? I don 't know . She 's gone . GUN CLICKS Get us back to the Hub . Jack , what are you doing ? ! Resisting the urge to shoot . Tosh , get everything from the weapons room . Fast as you can . It 's locked down , there 's no manual override . Just open the store ! On your knees ! Hands above your head ! Jack , for God 's sake ! What are you doing ? ! I gave you an order ! Gwen , help her ! Did you know that thing was down there ? I put her there . You hid a Cyberman within Torchwood ? ! And you didn 't tell us ? What else are you keeping from us ? Like you care . I clear up your shit . No questions asked and that 's the way you like it . When did you last ask me anything about my life ? Her name 's Lisa . She 's my girlfriend . Why didn 't you tell us ? We could have helped you . Torchwood exists to destroy alien threats . Why would I tell you about her ? A little loyalty , perhaps ? My loyalty 's to her ! She worked for Torchwood . She was caught up in battle . I owe it to Lisa ... WE owe it to her ... to find a cure . Ianto , you have to believe me . There is no cure . There never will be . Those who are converted stay that way . Your girlfriend will not be the exception . You can 't know that for sure . Look , you need to know what 's happening here . Because this is where these things start . Small decisions that become mass slaughter . These creatures regain a foothold by exploiting human weakness . Then they take a base . Rebuild their forces . And before you know it , the Cyber race is spreading out across the universe , erasing worlds , assimilating populations . All because of the tiny beginnings here . We need to stop her ... together ! You 're not listening to me ! The conversion was never completed ! She already tried to kill Gwen ! You think she 's gonna stop there ? There is no turning back for her now ! I 'm ... not giving up on her . I love her . Can you understand that , Jack ? Haven 't you ever loved anyone ? You need to figure out whose side you 're on here . Because if you don 't know ... you 're not going to make it out of this alive . There 's no way this weapons store 's gonna open . It 's going to take six hours for the power to come back online . Let me talk to her . I can still save her . Save all of us . She 's not a monster . MECHANICAL WHIRRING Ianto ! Lisa ... It 's me . You can 't just let him go ... Ssh ! The army will be rebuilt from here . This building is suitable . Who are you ? Human point two . No ! Lisa ... So how come you look like human point one ? I do not understand . Look at yourself . Go ahead . Remember , Lisa . Remember who you are . The upgrade is incomplete . You 're still human . I am ... disgusting . I have ... I am ... wrong . We can help you . I must start again . Upgrade properly . For God 's sake ! Have you heard yourself ? Lisa , please . I brought you here to heal you . So we could be together . Together . Yes . Transplant my brain into your body . The two of us ... together . Fused . We 'll be one complete person . Isn 't that what love is ? No . Then we are not compatible . Argh ! Code Nine manoeuvres . Go ! Gwen ! Gwen ! Get out of there ! Lisa ! What you waiting for ? Run . We all ran . She 's coming after us . There 's a surprise ( ! ) Could you be any less helpful ? ! I just helped you escape ! Shut up , both of you ! OK , now , this is a fight to the death . We do whatever is necessary to destroy her . Forget what Ianto said . That thing is not human . Clear ? Yeah , yeah . What 's this ? Something Suzie scavenged . She claimed that it could open any lock in 45 seconds . I want you out the exit gates up the emergency stairs to reception . She 'll never open that door without power ! It weighs a ton ! Anyway , I 'm not leaving you here ! Just do as I say ! All of you ! Once in reception ... panel next to the desk , pull it out . Take circuit 357 from the main system and patch it to these . There should be enough power in there for what we need . Once the main circuit goes live , get out . Meet us by the water tower . Go ! .. You two ... find anything that even resembles a weapon . Autopsy room . There should be some lethal equipment ... What are you gonna do ? Buy you some time . Go ! Hey ! Lisa ! It is Lisa , isn 't it ? You 've been hiding in my basement . That 's OK . Draining my power , I can live with that ... But now you 're starting to hurt my friends . This is gonna stop ! Come on ! This building belongs to me now . You will all be deleted ... I 'm sorry for what they did to you . But this ends here . How did he survive that ? Is that all you got ? I 'm not so easily deleted . We can 't help him . Shit ! Is there another exit ? No ! We 're trapped ? ! Get in ! No way ! Lie on top of me and it 'll take us both . I 'm not laying on top of you ! I 'm not saying it 's a brilliant idea , but it 's the only one we 've got ! What do we do ? IANTO PANTS ( Ssh ! ) MOBILE PHONE RINGS Where is it ? Quick , please ! Turn it off ! Turn it off ! All right , lover , it 's the man of your dreams ! I 've had a couple of beers with Daf and we 're off for a curry , so can you video Wife Swap ? Don 't you touch her ! LISA SCREAMS What the hell was that ? What ? Snogging me ! Last kiss for the condemned man ! Little embarrassing given we haven 't been killed . What ? ! It 's not like I fancy you or anything . I was on top of you . I could feel your hard-on . Yeah , well , you didn 't exactly struggle , did you ? It was kill or be killed . Owen 's right . There was no choice . Ianto , move ! Get out ! GET OUT I SAID ! MOVE ! MOVE ! You should be dead . I 'm the stubborn type . Get behind me ! 357 , 357 , come on ! That 's right . Stay back . This 'll at least give you heartburn . The power will run out . I can wait . Jack , help her . Give her a chance to surrender ... Have you not seen what she 's done ? Let her stay in the cells ! We have to reverse the process ! I 've told you ! We 're past that ! Hold him back ! What are you gonna do ? Don 't ask questions , just get him on there and hold him ! What is that stuff ? Kind of a barbecue sauce . It helps identify its food . Help what identify its food ? ! I 'm sorry . PTERODACTYL SQUEALS You 'll kill her ! Let me go ! Let me help her ! Yes ! Hold him still ! NO ! Call it off her ! You can do that ! Have some fucking mercy ! NO-O-O ! It worked ! What happened to ... ? No . You could have saved her ! Argh ! You 're worse than anything locked up down there ! One day , I 'll have the chance to save you ... and I 'll watch you suffer and die . It was the only thing that would stop her ! Listen , when I was at reception , I managed to trip the lockdown timer . The power should be coming back on any second . We can get back in . Ianto ! Pizza ! DOOR BUZZES Ianto ? Bloody hell ! Ianto ? D 'you want these or not ? PTERODACTYL SQUEALS Ianto ! Stop ! She can 't have survived that attack . I used my initiative ! I 'm sorry ! When I want you to think for yourself , I 'll tell you . Maybe if you 'd told me your plan , I wouldn 't have done it ! Ianto , don 't be stupid ! I 've nothing left to lose . There 's always something left to lose . I 'm going back in to save her . Anybody tries to stop me , I 'll shoot them . Ianto , put the gun ... You make a threat like that , you better be prepared to follow it through . See , you disobey me now ... I really will shoot you . Get off me ! You wanna go back in there ? You go in to finish the job . If she 's still alive , you execute her . No way . You brought this down on us . You hid her . You hid yourself from us . Now it 's time for you to stand as part of the team . Jack ... The girl you loved has gone . Your loyalty is to us now . You can 't order me to do that . You execute her or I 'll execute you both ! I won 't do it . You can 't make me . You like to think you 're a hero . But you 're the biggest monster of all . I 'm giving you ten minutes . Then we 're coming in . Pick it up . How can you ask him ... ? I don 't need your opinion ! PTERODACTYL SQUEALS Lisa ! Ianto ... Ianto , it 's me . It 's Lisa . I 'm human again . You fought so hard for me , I had to hold on for you , so I took this body and transplanted the brain . You 're not Lisa . You always said you didn 't love me for what I looked like . Last time you said that , it was a Saturday . We were hungover . You made cheese toasties , and moaned I hadn 't descaled my kettle . That night , we camped on a beach in Brittany . It got so freezing we wore our coats and shared one sleeping bag . When we woke up the next morning , a dog was pissing on our tent . Hold me , Ianto . I need you to hold me . I need you to tell me it 's all right . HE CRIES GUN CLICKS What are you doing ? Ianto , it 's me ! You wouldn 't shoot me . I did this for you ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Lisa ! We can be upgraded together . ALARM BLARES You 'd never have shot him . Not really . Wouldn 't I ? Would you have shot me if I 'd gone to stand by him ? But you didn 't . If I had , though . But you didn 't . Will he stay ? All that deception . Because he couldn 't bear to live without her . So have you ever loved anyone that much ? When she had hold of you , I thought , just for a moment , I thought maybe you could die after all . Wanna know a secret ? So did I. And just for a second there , I felt so ... alive . Are you kidding me ? That 's him , we have to find him before all hell let 's loose . It 's little girls , their little bodies . No-one can hurt me . They protect their own , their chosen ones . Are you saying our machines can 't pick them up ? Nothing can . She was beautiful , I loved her at first sight . It 's gone crazy . No ! This means these creatures can invade my life whenever they feel like it and I am scared , Jack . For the sake of the world , this is our only chance !

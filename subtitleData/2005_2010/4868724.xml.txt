 And you 're listening to WZPZ 720 on your A.M. dial . The lines are open now , so now 's your chance . There 's still no information on the disappearance of six Lansdale residents . Forgot my gear . - Hurry , I don 't want to miss kickoff . - If you see anything or anyone suspicious , please contact Sheriff Golightly 's office . All calls are anonymous . Well , that 's it for me . Cheryl Clark is up next to keep you company all the way home . Let 's go , Raymond . - What 's the holdup ? - Just a second . Aah ! Raymond ! Raymond ! " Night of Desirable Objects " There you go . Thank you . You take care , Agent Dunham . I will . Let me get that . Peter , I 'm fine . I know you are . What ? Well ... Just looking for the hidden ninja sword . Well , that one wasn 't covered by insurance . Thank you . Did you check the drawers ? No . Anything I 've forgotten , they can keep . I don 't want to spend another minute here . I 'm , uh , no good at sitting around . You 're also no good at letting people help you . Oh , I 'll let you carry my suitcase . Aah ! Did you get me everything on my list ? The FBI signed off on everything you asked for , including new housing for you and your father . But the C-130 transport plane is proving a bit tough to requisition . We 're not gonna need it for this one . Pennsylvania ? I was trolling the FBI databases , looking for any cases that were similar to Olivia 's . Sudden disappearances . This town has had six missing people in the last two months , four of which eyewitnesses say just disappeared into thin air . Thought it was worth checking out . - How is she ? - Olivia ? She 'll be fine . Do it . And keep a close eye on Dunham . All right , Walter , the cameras are ready . Here we go . Agent Dunham , you 're just in time . Just in time for what ? We 're re-creating your car accident . Okay , Astrid , ready . 3 ... 2 ... 1 . - The photographs , quickly . - I know , Walter . Y - your accident - I 'm-I 'm testing a theory . Oh . Thank you . Excuse me . Uh ... No matter what I try , I can 't make the frog disappear . We 've been at this for five hours . Science is patience ! It 's also slimy . From all the evidence , you were missing from your car for at least an hour before you came crashing back through the windshield . You simply disappeared . He thinks you traveled to another universe . You see , Agent Dunham , we assume that our universe is the only universe . But that 's not true . There is an infinite number of universes . And in each of them , there is a version of us - You , me , and Agent Farnsworth - But each one slightly different ... Changed over time based on the accumulation of our choices . So ... in this reality - Walter . We 've had this conversation before , haven 't we ? I know that I went somewhere . I think I met with someone . But the rest is like a dream that I ... I just can 't quite remember . Perhaps you will ... in time . When they said you were dead ... When I saw you lying there ... I don 't know what I would have done . Walter ... But you 're here now , and apart from the obvious , you ... You appear to be fine . I appear to be ? No . Traveling to an alternate reality has its consequences . No . No , you 'll be fine . Hey . You feel up to going for a drive ? Put it in back there . Hello . Hello . Hello . I 'm Walter Bishop . Hello . Uh , Sheriff Golightly ? Special Agent Olivia Dunham . This is Peter and Walter Bishop . Don 't remember calling the FBI . Well , your office has filed six Missing-Persons reports . Seven now . Seven . All under the same circumstances ? Same as the others . Just disappear . Be damned if I know what to make of it . Well , we 're all victims of our own gene pool . Someone must have peed in yours . I - I 'm sorry , you 'll have to excuse my father . Yes . Excuse me . Sheriff . These two men are both special investigators with the FBI . And when the good men and women who have come here from three separate counties have finished collecting evidence , then you can see it . Let me see what you got . May I ? Wonderful ! Have you run across something like this before ? Absolutely not . The air here is quite auspicious ! Makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck . The air . This ! It 's a fresh mystery , pregnant with possibilities . Who knows where it may lead ? I bet you he knows . Here are the investigation files . Everything we have so far from the first disappearance , which is not a hell of a lot . Possible suspect interviews , case leads , dead ends from the disappearances . Okay . Thank you . Agent Dunham ... The FBI has very specific laws that govern what their jurisdiction involves . None of these disappearances occurred on a military base . None of them happened across state lines . You 've already given us evidence to analyze . - There 's information in these files - - I understand . But I can get a special procedural order to - Why are you so interested in this case ? Excuse me ? Why are you so interested in this case ? I , um ... I - I 'm sorry , I-I - The night of desirable objects ? I have one just like this . You know yourself a little bit about night fishing , do you ? I 've used hair jigs and pork rind , rubber jigs for largemouth . You ever try using spinnerbaits at night ? Oh , yeah . You can use pork rind with those too , you know . - Can you really ? - Yeah . I like the topwater ... Agent Francis . - Hey , it 's me . - Hey . Look , I 'm sending you a victim sheet from a multiple Missing-Persons case in Pennsylvania . Can you run the names and , um ... And notify me if any red flags come up ? Sure . I just have to run an errand . Okay . Thanks , Charlie . Bye . I 'll be with you in , uh - in just a minute . I need the back room . Now ! Oh , this is wildly helpful . According to the sheriff , the second person who disappeared - His mom makes a mean apple pie . In case you were wondering , Andre Hughes is partial to flannel . He likes to wear flannel shirts , except , of course , in the summer . I 'm gonna go get a soda . - You want something ? - No , thank you . Hmm . How 's it going , Walter ? I plan to urinate in 23 minutes . Good to know . I 'm telling you because I 'm going to need help unzipping my fly . I can 't feel my hand . It seems the substance from Pennsylvania is a paralytic . Which means that whoever took those people paralyzed them first , so they couldn 't fight back . Interesting theory . Very devious . Do you think we can trace it , where it 's from ? The base solution contains human DNA , male , I think . Of course , it 's a mutation . Perhaps a whole new stage of human evolution . Wouldn 't that be fantastic ? If we 've stumbled upon a mutant ? No . Fantastic 's not the first word that pops into my mind . We 're all mutants . What 's more remarkable ... is how many of us appear to be normal . Find anything ? Hey , you remember Andre Hughes ? Uh , yeah , Hughes . He was the flannel guy , right ? Yeah , well , he 's a neighbor of the Shanes , and he was at their house when the sheriff went to follow up on their son 's disappearance . He was also at the Thomasons' just after Jennifer Thomason disappeared . Sheriff Golightly arrived just as Hughes was leaving . What are you thinking ? I 'm thinking you drive . No ! No ! Aw , hell . Aw , hell . Who are you ? Ah , Mr. Hughes . Olivia Dunham , and this is Peter Bishop . We 're wanting to ask you a few questions . FBI . Oh . Uh ... I assume you 've heard about the people that have recently gone missing . Uh , yeah . I know about it . I 'd love to help if I can . Please ... After you . Either of you have any experience with water wells ? No . No . Ah . This time of year I spend most of my time maintaining and ... digging ' em out . I wouldn 't wish it on either of you . Eh . It 's like to drive me crazy . This is my fifth well in two months . Can 't seem to find that switch button . I 'm just gonna go in the other room and wash this dirt off . Make yourself comfortable . Excuse me . Is there someone else in this house ? No . There 's someone else in this house . Did you hear that ? Keep him busy . Come out of there . Oh ! Peter ! Oh , my God . Oh , Peter , oh , my God , I - I-I 'm so sorry ! I thought I heard something . I thought I - I thought I heard someone . You fired a gun in my house , and now you 're bringing me down here ? I don 't understand . You don 't think I had anything to do with these missing people , do you ? Well , at the moment , Mr. Hughes , we 're just trying to gather information . So I understand that you 're a doctor . Yes . But you retired nearly 20 years ago . That 's right . - Anything ? - Not yet . What have you done since then ? We scoured the house . There 's no evidence that links him to the disappearances . Just a bunch of old lab equipment . We had it packed up , sent over to Harvard . Walter 's taking a look at it now . According to our records , in the wake of the disappearances , you visited with some of the victims ' relatives . With , uh , Martin Shane 's mother and , uh ... Jennifer Thomason 's husband . Yes . Were they former patients ? No . Just friends ? I hardly knew either of them . But I thought I could help them . I ... I thought I could comfort them . I lost my wife and my son 17 years ago . She died , giving birth to him . He was mine . For five minutes , I had a son . I could never hurt these people . Mr. Hughes , we 'd like to take a sample of your blood . We 'd like to compare it to some evidence that we found at the scene of the last disappearance . Do we , uh , have your permission to do that ? Am I under arrest ? Not presently . Then , no . No . You don 't have my permission . I 'll get a warrant to take his blood . Have Olivia hold him for 24 hours . It says in her report Dunham 's gun went off ? Yeah . Misfire . I 'll send Agent Jessup to the Hughes ' house . Dizziness ? No . How 's your short-term memory ? Uh , what 's your name ? Good . You seem to be doing well . You can go ahead and get dressed . Hello , Agent Dunham . I haven 't had a chance to visit since your ... accident , but Agent Broyles has been keeping me apprised . I was concerned . Well , thanks . I - I 'm doing okay . I 'm glad to hear that ... Though sometimes the physical injury is the easiest to get over . I remember when I was first diagnosed with cancer . Beside the fear , my most overwhelming sensation was one of betrayal ... The realization that my own body was fundamentally foreign to me , that it was a threat . You 've been through quite an ordeal , Olivia - One of many lately . To overlook it would be a mistake . What 's this ? Sam Weiss , the man who helped put me back together . You know , the FBI has psychologists . If I thought that I needed - Well , he 's not a psychologist . When you 're ready , I believe he can help you . Okay . Thanks . That was Olivia - Agent Jessup told her Hughes may have killed his wife and child 17 years ago . Oh , finally some good news . I assume we can dig them up . I haven 't had any bodies to examine . Seven missing persons , no bodies . All right . I 'll get an exhumation order . Put his wife 's coffin is down here . If Hughes is hiding something , we 're gonna find out what it is . Okay , let 's open it up . Let 's open the baby boy 's . Oh , my God . There 's no body . Looks like something dug its way in . Or dug its way out . I think we have some questions for Mr. Hughes . That 's curious . What ? What 's curious ? Mrs. Hughes has ... scarring to the joints , butterfly lesions to the face . Systemic lupus erythematosus , a very advanced case . Lupus ? Which means what ? Notably , she was incapable of producing offspring . Except she did . She had a baby boy . Yeah . A baby boy ? That 's impossible . Lupus results in an overactive immune system . Her own body would have destroyed the fetus - long before - - Yes , and yet despite that , she was somehow able to give birth to a son . Who , from all appearances , then burrowed his way out of his casket . The grave of a boy ... who was not in his grave . How the hell did this happen ? Why wasn 't anyone watching him ? We 're looking into it right now . We need to have Andre Hughes ' body taken back to Walter Bishop 's lab as soon as possible . Already on its way . Hey , Jim , it 's Alex . Yeah , I know I 'm late . Yeah , I 'm leaving right now , alright ? Yeah , I understand . I 'll take care of it . I 'll call him right now . Agent Dunham ? Agent Dunham ? Peter , I 've got it . Mrs. Hughes ' womb . You were right . She did give birth . I 'm glad we got that settled . The afterbirth is still inside her . Look . Look at the tissue composition . Walter . According to this , Hughes' baby wasn 't entirely human . It explains his research - Reproductive biology and gene replacement . I hypothesize that he may have used some scorpion DNA - It 's an incredibly resilient creature - And also possibly something that lives underground , a - a mole rat . Scorpions do paralyze their prey with toxin . It could explain the blue liquid . Hey , what did I miss ? Hughes ' baby - he altered it inside the womb so that it could survive its mother 's lupus . - Okay . That is sick . - That is brilliant ! He 's created a super-baby - one capable of surviving in the most inhospitable environment . Oh , Agent Dunham . We 've had a breakthrough . I heard . Hughes ' son . I think I might know where he is . When we were at the Hughes ' house , I heard a noise , like something breathing . I thought that I had imagined it , but ... I didn 't . So if Hughes ' son is still alive , I think that he is somewhere in that house ... Or near that house . Or under it . Hello ? Sheriff Golightly ? Peter . Hey . I think it 's a canine tooth . Ugh . Confirmed . Dog . Gonna grab a shovel . Peter ? Yeah . Aah ! Oh ! Peter ! Olivia ! Oh ! Oh ! Olivia ! Aah ! Oh ! Oh ! Peter ! He must have realized that it was his son , because we found traps set in all of these holes that he 'd dug all over his property . Could you imagine living with a burden like that ... when all you wanted was a son ? Charlie , what if I don 't want to remember ? You mean your accident ? All of it - Where I went , who I met with , what he told me . I mean , what if there 's a part of my brain that 's trying to protect me ? I 'm just not sure you have much of a choice here , Olivia . If Walter was correct about you going to that other universe , then whatever secrets you learned might be worth remembering . Another universe . I never thought that I would ever hear you utter those words with a straight face . You 've come a long way , Charlie Francis . Well , you know , whatever it is ... We 'll deal with it together . I 'll help you remember . I know you will . - Are you going fishing , son ? - Yes . But not alone . Oh , no ? Who with ? Well , once upon a time , there was a young man ... probably around 10 or 11 , who got it in his head that he wanted to take his father fishing . So he saved up all the money from his paper route and bought a very special lure . Oh ! It 's called the Night of Desirable Objects . Sadly , his father was never really all that available to him , so ... What started out as a would-be bonding experience ended up with a young man fishing alone in a boat . A - and this young man ... gave this to you ? Yes , Walter . Can I come ... with you and your friend ? You know what , Walter ? I think that would make the trip . Good . Good . If you want to bowl , we close in 15 minutes . No . Um ... I 'm looking for Sam Weiss . Is he here ? Sam ? No . Well , do you know where I can find him ? Atlanta , Georgia . He met a girl ... moved away . Oh . Thank you . That 's it ? Excuse me ? You 're giving up ? I tell you he met a girl and moved away , and you 're just gonna give up ? You 're Sam . Nina Sharp said you 'd be coming by . Have the headaches started yet ? No . They will . What are you , a size 8 ?

 - Previously on heroes ... [ rumbling ] - I must have gotten your ability on the street . - Ability ? - Aah ! - [ gasps ] - Peter Petrelli ? - Hiro . - You 're supposed to be the man with the plan , remember ? - I 'm not sure I 'm that guy anymore . Well , it 's just , you know , kind of sad When you look back on your life And you realize it hasn 't amounted to much . - What are you talking about ? Your whole life has been about trying to help people . - But I don 't remember actually helping anybody . - The guy don 't know his name , what day it is , nothing . - I 'm gonna help you . - You 're a watchmaker from queens Who murdered your own mother . - No ! [ dogs barking ] - What are you waiting for ? - A broken vessel . An empty shell . What is a man without mind , Without memory ? A ghost ? A body in search of a soul ? With no compass to guide us , How can we know if our destiny is to seek the good ... Or obey the demons that whisper in our ear ? The blank slate hungers to be written upon . The body thrives when the heart has a mission . - How you feeling , hiro ? You collapsed in my apartment last night . You remember ? - Mm . And you brought me to the hospital ? - I spoke to the doctors . Hiro , you 're very sick . - Yes , I know . Brain tumor . I 'm dying . I guess I didn 't want to believe That I would end up in a hospital bed so soon , But ... Here I am . - Look , I know about dying . I 've helped a lot of people through this transition . And I 'm gonna help you with whatever you need . Maybe that 's why you came to me . - Maybe . But maybe not . Destiny has been sending me to different places , Different times , To right many wrongs before I die . Maybe destiny has brought me to you , peter ... To fix a problem in your life . - No , my- - my life is fine . I really don 't need any fixing . What if you didn 't come here so that you can fix me ? What if you 're here so that I can fix you ? - I 've seen the best doctors in japan . There 's nothing that can be done . - Maybe not by doctors . The faster I can go ... - Ooh . - The faster I can get back . - Go--go where ? - Just sit tight , okay ? I 'll be right back . - Okay . - Are you okay ? - Did you send a cello to my apartment ? - A cello ? No . - There 's something wrong with my ability , Or whatever you call it . - There 's nothing wrong- - It 's confusing , at first . I know . It 's difficult for everyone in the beginning . And I want to talk about it with you , but I can 't . Right now I have to leave . - Leave ? - My friend is dying , and it can 't wait . You know what ... You have questions about abilities ? You should talk to him . He knows everything there is to know about abilities . His name is hiro . Talk to him , and I 'll be back soon . - Where are you going ? - To save his life . - He 's not what you expected . - For years I 've heard rumors , stories . Sylar , the most powerful one of all . But that man seems beaten . Afraid . What happened to him , lydia ? - I 'm not sure . It 's like there are two sides at war within him . - [ chuckles ] [ sighs ] [ clicks tongue ] Good morning , sylar . How 'd you sleep ? - You called me sylar . Who 's sylar ? - That 's you . That 's your name . - The police told me my name is gabriel . - You don 't even know your name ? What happened to you ? - [ chuckles ] I don 't know . I can 't remember . - You know what I think ? I think a great damage has been done to you . And you 've come to us to heal . Walk with me . Spend the day among us , And with time , your memories will return . What do we call you ... Gabriel ? Sylar ? Take a deep breath . What 's the first name that pops into your head ? - Call me nathan . - Why are you doing this for me ? I mean , you 're taking me in , hiding me from the police . You don 't even know me . - Of course I do . You may not realize it , But you 're a man of great powers . - Powers ? Last night at the police station , I raised my hand and somehow threw a man across a room . What 's wrong with me ? - Oh , there 's nothing wrong . You 're special . Take a look around . Here , everyone is . Hey , teddy , show him what you can do . [ chuckles ] - You mean everybody here ... - Is like you . Like us . Lydia , come meet our new friend . Show him around a bit , will you ? I think you two are gonna like each other . - My pleasure . - [ gasps ] - What is it ? - I remember shaking a lot of hands . Like a I was a politician or something . Is that possible ? - I suppose anything is possible . - Come on . - Hi . - Laundry day . Is this a bad time ? - No- - come on in . - How goes job hunting ? - Unproductive . - Well , hang in there . It 'll work out . - Thank you . - Can I have some quarters ? I need , like , 12 of them . - Yeah , sure . Over there in the jar . Help yourself . - Don 't take this the wrong way , But have you ever thought about doing a little volunteer work ? [ noise at door ] - Oh , wait ... - Peter ? How did you get in the bathroom ? - It 's been a long time since I 've teleported . - I need you to deliver some tickets . - " captain lubbock , baltimore p.D. " Isn 't this the guy who was hunting sylar last night ? - Something is very wrong . The memories are returning , but they 're the wrong memories . There 's someone else inside his head . We need to jump-start the real sylar . Wake the sleeping lion . - If the real sylar sees this cop coming at him , He might kill him . - Indeed , he might . - Hiro 's dying ? - He doesn 't have to if I can find a healer . That 's why I came over here , noah . I want you to help me locate one . - What about my blood ? Can 't you take me back with you- - We can give him a blood transfusion ? - That won 't work . A tumor is living tissue . Your blood 's regenerative powers Would only make it grow faster . But there was a kid , Bag-and-tag of three to four years ago . - How long does he have ? - Hard to tell . It could be a couple months . Could be a couple hours . - Yeah , that 's him . Jeremy greer . I found him when he was 13 . I was getting a report of a kid that was bringing Squashed bugs back to life . - Back from the dead ? - Well , no , not exactly . But if just a leg still twitching , All he had to do was touch them and away they would fly . We studied him for four days and , Of course , erased his memory . He was a good kid . Or he wanted to be . He couldn 't decide If his power was a gift or a curse . - Well , if he can save hiro , it 's definitely a gift . - Cainan , georgia . You ready ? - Yeah . - Samuel 's brother joseph began the tradition Of morning chores . He believed that hard work helped bind A community together . - Well , I 'm certainly looking forward To getting my hands dirty . I haven 't done an honest day 's work since , uh- - Since I can 't remember when . - [ chuckles ] It 's nice having you here . We don 't see a new face among us that often . Especially one so handsome . - Well , I should get us some shovels , maybe . - Hey . - How you doing ? That lydia always had a thing for bad boys . - What do you mean ? - I 've heard about you , sylar . How you steal powers from other people . - [ chuckles ] how I ... I 'm sorry , man , I literally have No idea what you 're talking about . - I 'm sure you can do some fancy tricks . But you know what , I have some tricks of my own . - Uh ... Okay . Excuse me . - Wow . Those are kind of in the way . - Are you gonna stop this ? - Boys will be boys . Why don 't we let the others finish up here . There 's someone I 'd like you to meet . - It 's so strange when that happens . My hand just rises up and can suddenly do These incredible things , like motor memory . - Memories don 't only exist in the mind . The body retains everything . [ jet engine roars ] - I remember flying . - You mean flying in a plane . - No , I mean , like piloting a jet . I flew jets in the military , maybe . - A politician 's life , jet pilot . It all sounds like a very exciting life . But it isn 't yours . Someone 's done something to you . Polluted your mind somehow . I thought your true memories would return on their own , But it 's just not happening . You want to know who you really are , don 't you ? - Of course I do . - Then it 's time for stronger measures . Damian . This is damian . He has a powerful gift . In his hands , your true memories will be returned . Are you ready to know the truth ? - Yes . - Take him to the house of mirrors . - Oh , go away . I have no more blood left . No more blood . - Blood ? I 'm sorry ... I read lips , but yours move differently . - Oh , sorry . Japanese accent . - I 'm emma . - I 'm hiro . - Yeah . Peter Petrelli said I could ask you questions about my ... Abilities . - You have a power ? - How can I make it stop ? - No , manifesting a power is a wondrous time . A hero never refuses the call . - I 'm deaf . I can 't hear the call . Oh , you must have many questions . - Just one . How do I turn it off ? - It 's not a light switch . It 's part of who you are . - Sorry to have bothered you . - Dead plants , dead bushes . - Not exactly what you 'd expect from a healer , huh ? - So what do you know about this kid ? - Well , not much . You know , I tested him . I wrote up a report , threw it in the file . But the kid was just coming into his ability . He had a lot of questions , So naturally we wiped his memory , Sent him back to his messed up family . And I went on to my next assignment . The company was never what you 'd call a support group . - Yeah , more about powers and less about the people . - But you saw him heal , right ? - Yeah . Bugs . Dog that got hit by a car . Day four I slashed my arm pretty bad . The kid touched it , it was good as new . - Guess his power doesn 't work on birds . [ clears throat ] That smells like ... - Death . - Hello ? Is anybody home ? Oh ! [ coughs ] - Hello ? - Oh ... Noah . Noah . [ coughing ] Ugh . - The parents . - What the hell happened here ? - There was a case in china . This woman manifested as a healer , But as time went on , It evolved into something very different . There was a flip side . She could control the flow of life--give it ... - Or take it away ? - Yeah . Jeremy ? Jeremy , is that you ? [ gunshot ] - Gabriel . Hello , gabriel . - Mom ? [ speaking inaudibly ] - Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Oh , my god , no ! No , this isn 't me . This isn 't me . Why are you doing this to me ? Make it stop , please ! Make it stop ! - So tell me about your ability . I have an ability too . I am the master of time and space . Well , I was . Lately , time and space has been the master of me . Oh , is that my brain scan ? - No . Mine . I see sounds . They make colors . - A new ability can be frightening . But you must not turn away from it . - I want it to stop . - Huh ? [ gunshot ] - I don 't think he 's shooting to kill , noah . - He 's just warning us to stay away . Still , we 're talking about a scared kid With a small cannon in his hands . - All right , I 'm going up . - No . I need to talk to him . There 's a staircase out back , though . - Yeah , yeah . I 'm on it . - Jeremy ? Jeremy , I 'm coming upstairs . Unarmed . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Talk to me , jeremy . Say something . - Stay away , all right . I 'm warning you ! - No , I 'm coming upstairs , So if you 're gonna shoot , lock and load . - I told you to keep away ! - Why ? What happens if I come near you ? - Everything I touch ends up dead . - Captain lubbock . I 'm samuel sullivan . Glad to see you and your family could make it . - I appreciate you sending those tickets over this morning . But a gotta ask- - why me ? - Ah , we always try and do something special For local law enforcement . I heard about you on the news last night . Out chasing down some escaped prisoner ? - You 'll indulge me . I 've been showing this To everyone I can . Got a lot of people on the hunt for this one . - Don 't think I 've seen him . But I could be wrong . A lot of folks come and go around here . - Well , if you spot him , call me right away . - I absolutely will . Enjoy the carnival . Mrs. Lubbock . - No ! [ shudders ] no . No . Stop . Make it stop . Please , please ... Oh , my god . Oh , oh ... Oh , my god ! Oh--oh- - Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Oh--oh , my god ! My god , no . This isn 't me . No ! Please make it stop--no ! Please . No , this can 't be me . This can 't be me . Please make it- - No ! [ vomiting ] - Tell me what happened . - Don 't come any closer ! - Okay , I 'm right here . I 'm right here . What happened to your parents ? - I killed them . I was angry , and I just- - I touched them ... And they died . I didn 't mean to do it . - I know you didn 't . You know , what 's happened to you , jeremy , It 's--it 's not fair . You never should have been left to suffer through this alone . - And who are you ? - You don 't remember me , but we 've met . I know you . I know all about you . I know about your power . I know that you 're not a killer . You 're a healer . - I used to heal things . And then it turned . And now I kill ! - No , you 're still a healer . You can do both . - Stop . If you come one step closer , I swear to god I will shoot you ! - Noah ! [ breathing unsteadily ] [ pained groan ] [ gasps ] - No ! Peter , stay with me . - Oh , my god . - Peter . Peter ! Peter , stay with me . Peter ! - Oh , my god . - He 's bleeding out . He 's never gonna make it to the hospital . You need to heal him . - I can 't . - Yes , you can , jeremy . I 've seen it with my own eyes . You need to come over here and lay your hands on him now ! - If I touch him , he 'll die . - He 'll die if you don 't . You can do this . Listen to me . My power is understanding people like you . That 's what I do . What happened to your parents never has to happen again . You can control it , and you can heal him . - Everything I touch dies . - I 'm touching you right now . You can do this . You can give life . Come on . Focus , jeremy . Visualize peter healing . Imagine what it 's gonna look like When the wound disappears , His eyes open again , and he is healthy and alive . Picture it , jeremy . Keep that thought in your mind . - [ gasps ] [ breathing more steadily ] [ gasping ] Oh ... [ laughing ] - [ laughing ] - Welcome back . - [ groans ] yeah . - Ta-da ! And now , to assist hiro the magnificent , Please welcome to the stage emma the ... Also magnificent ! [ applause ] - Hiro , what are you doing ? - Magic . Oh , and we are going to need much applause For the next feat of magicalness . I will make emma ... Disappear ! [ applause suddenly stops ] - It 's like time is ... - Standing still . - [ chuckles ] It 's all so beautiful . - There are no bad powers , emma . You just have to understand them . And when you do , you will learn to use your powers To do good things in the world . Oh , but please , for now , our magic trick . Hide behind the curtains . Over there , yeah . Abracadabra ... Alakazam ! [ amazed murmurs ] Where did she go ? Where is emma ? Oh , emma ! Oh ... Emma ? Oh , emma ? Where are you ? There she is ! Ta-da ! [ applause ] A big applause for emma the magnificent ! Oh , but we have to give applause in a different way . Like this . - All those murders ... All those memories in my mind- - But I cannot believe that they 're mine . How many did I kill ? A dozen ? Two dozen ? - I 'm sorry for your pain . Truth can be difficult . - Difficult ? I am a monster ! I stalk people and slash open their skulls . - Has it ever occurred to you to question What brought you here ? Why providence has seen fit for our paths to cross ? This place is a safe , protected womb . But out there is a cruel world Filled with people who persecute our kind . Can 't you see , they made you what you are ! They turned you into a monster . - Oh , that makes it okay ? - It makes it the truth ! You wanted to know who you are . And now you do . The question now is , where are you gonna go from here ? Do you wallow in self-pity , Or do you learn to use the gifts god gave you and command fear And respect , and defend against those Who would do us harm ? All in the embrace of a community Who loves you for exactly who you are . - You just met me . You would take me in here ... Knowing what I 've done , knowing who I am ? - We 're family . Family accepts . Family forgives . There 's a problem . That policeman who was hunting you , He 's here . It 's not just about you anymore . We 're harboring a criminal now . - What do you want me to do ? - I ... Can 't make that decision for you . But your presence here puts all of us in jeopardy . Something has to be done . - Where is he ? - One of my men saw him going into the house of mirrors . - I don 't know what to do with him . A leash . A cage ? Maybe a cattle prod . Now ... You keep your japanese tush in this bed ! - I am not a pet . - She 's right , hiro . You 're sick . You need to stop using your power Before it kills you . - But my power isn 't killing me . It keeps me alive . When I was stuck in my cubicle every day wasting my life , That 's when I was dying . - How can you be so focused helping others , Knowing what it might cost ? - I had a friend once . She knew she was dying , But that didn 't push her off her path . She told me to keep joy and dignity alive , Even in the face of death . Her name was charlie . Oh , my god . I can 't believe I left her off the list . - What ? What are you doing ? - Paper and pen , stat . I had a list . A list of all the wrongs I have to right before I die . I can 't believe I forgot her . - Hiro ... Promise me you won 't leave until peter returns . - There 's been an accident at 2627 otsego . Please send the police and the coroner . Did you get his ability ? - Yeah . So what next ? - Well , there 's an air field about six miles south of here Off the highway . I called in a favor and I got you a ride . It 's not as fast as the way you got here , but- - - You 're not coming with ? - No . All right , better hurry . Hiro 's waiting . - Okay , so , I jerry-rigged the heater . And I backed up the vent . It 's gonna look like carbon monoxide poisoning , okay ? You came home and you found them . All right ? - You 're staying here ? - Yeah . - How long ? - Till I know that you 're all right . Jeremy , it used to be my job To watch over people like you . But somehow I , um ... I lost my way . I dropped the ball . [ sirens blaring ] You may not know it , but I let you down . Come on . - You ! Hands above your head ... Now . Now ! - You need to leave here now . While there 's still time . - I got a better idea . You resist arrest , then I have an excuse . - I 'm just trying to save you . Unh ! [ grunting ] - What are you ? - Don 't just stand there , get a mop ! - That was beautiful . - You promised you would stay in bed . - Joy and dignity in the face of death . - Just like charlie . Come on , back to bed . Hiro . - You 're safe now . Tonight ... We welcome a new brother into our family . He will live and work among us ... And will be welcome here all the rest of our days . [ overlapping conversation ] There , there , edgar , don 't pout . - Good thing I followed that bastard . I had a feeling he wouldn 't follow through . - Aw , he 's just a baby learning how to walk . - What use is he to us like this ? What use is a lion that can 't kill ? - Maybe it 's better this way . We just make a better sylar . And when we do ... He 'll be ours forever . - Peter . - Emma . I 'm sorry it took so long . How is he ? - Hiro 's gone . - What ? - He disappeared . Just disappeared . - " save charlie . " - Charlie !

 " In 1997 Soviet bioweapon facility R-17 was looted by black marketeers . " " The stolen biological agents were never recovered . " " Today more than a dozen similar facilities remain abandoned across the former Soviet Union with their inventories of biological agents still in place . " " SIBERIA " Give me your flashlight , quickly . Now you won 't be tempted to leave without me . Don 't worry . We 're under the contaminated areas . Hurry . Come on , hurry . Wait out here . Our Chechen friends will pay us a half million Euros for Pandora 's box . Al-Qaeda will pay me a full million . The diseased call me the " Devil . " I am at war with that sub-human race who feed off the dead . They tremble at the thought of me . I 've killed more of them than I can count . To the diseased , I am the devil . Who else but God is left to judge me ? So before you condemn me for any crimes against humanity , just remember that you would not be reading this if I allowed the Diseased , that subhuman race , to inherit our world . I 'll start this book at the beginning so you understand everything . It doesn 't really matter how the world ended . The " Doomsday bug " got loose and everyone started dying . Have a seat . All right , rookie , you finally get your chance . You 're in . I 'm in ? You 're kidding me , right ? No , no . We 're short . Martinez is out , you 're the only one I got left . You 're in . You 've got your shot . Thank you ! Thank you ! You won 't regret this ! Yes ! Don 't get too fired up , we only got three games left and tha  s it . You 're a short timer . Wait until you see me play . Lionel . You brought a cell phone to the dugout ? One second . Uh , huh . No , no , no , no . I 'm off the clock . Get somebody else ! No , I 'm playing tonight ! Listen , I 've been waiting all year for this ! Get somebody else . What ? Okay . I 'll be there in twenty minutes . Bye . Why did I answer that stupid thing ! They said they were going to fire me if I didn 't get back to work . If I would have known that was the only baseball game that I would ever play , I would have quit my job . I coulïve been more than just a benchwarmer . But I didn 't know what was happening until it was too late . Oh , come on ! No one did . Stupid traffic ! I shouldn 't have answered that stupid phone , man . How stupid can you be , huh ? But no ... You had to answer that stupid phone . You could have been playing tonight this could have been your night , you know that ! I 'm so stupid . Damn hospital . Everyone I ever knew is gone and now I 'm alone . But enough about that , you want to know who I am . My name is Lionel Verney and today is Armageddon . My time is short so I 'm leaving this brief record to any remaining human beings who still might exist somewhere in the world . To you , I leave the history of the last man . The emergency room is full , we can 't take these people . You guys are stage one . All stage one over here . I 'm sorry , sir . You can 't go . Please wait over here . Who are you with ? You are stage two . Let me see you , kid . Ok , take this young man now . I 'm sorry madam , you have to wait . I 'm sorry , you have to wait . All stage one has to wait . Someone please help her , please . I worked at the hospital but I wasn 't a doctor or an R.N. Or anything . I was a " C.N.A. " That means I cleaned up after patients but I was certified because I handled a lot of infectious human waste . I know , too much information . But that job paid the bills until I got my big break playing baseball . Please , Doctor ! You 're going to have to see an R.N. I 've been waiting six hours ! Listen , I 'm an orderly ! I just clean stuff up , okay ? Okay ! It is a complete zoo out there . They almost spilled my coffee like forty times ! Floor ? So wha  s up ? I see you didn 't get out of here either , huh ? No , they called me back and you know what ? I was playing tonight . So wha  s up ? Not sure . There was maybe ifty people in the clinic when I got in today . Now there 's almost three hundred . What the hell is it ? Beats me . I 've got a dozen calls out and all the nurses are screaming for answers . Gosh , you have really pretty eyes , you know that ? You 're going to have to do a lot better than that , Romeo . I  s your floor . Hey , listen , umm ... We 're still on for tonight , huh ? Getting involved with your co-workers is a risky thing for your career . What career ? I should be playing baseball ! Hey ! I though you were playing baseball tonight ? What are you , kidding me ? Give me that . Hey Doc , that wasn 't very funny . Shut up and put a damn mask on , now ! What the hell is up with the Doc ? Keep an extra mask and gloves in your pockets , i  s some kind of contagion . Listen , I just talked to Eva right now and nobody knows ... Lionel , these patients are dying , fast . I  s something bad . Don 't scratch ; don 't touch your face ; and don 't put anything in your mouth until you 're off the floor and scrubbed . We don 't even know if i  s airborne , so put that mask on , now . And get this patient prepped for the morgue . Where is your mask ? I got it right here . The bedding , everything goes in with the body . And don 't worry about the paperwork , Admin is handling it all downstairs . Okay . Your gloves ? I don 't got any . Where are your gloves ? You don 't have any gloves ? Ugh . Pull your head out , will you ? I need everyone functioning here . I 'm here . One hundred percent , okay ? No you 're not . Now get that deceased patient downstairs . This is what I 'm talking about ! Tha  s it , I 'm out of here . He doesn 't bite ! Hey , I 've got another one here for you . Well there 's no more room at the inn . You know what , just leave them right there for now . I though like only six people died . Where did all these bodies come from ? Six ? You want to know where they come from ? Pediatrics , eight years old . And the E.R. , and this one was just dropped off by the E.M.T. ' s . Well , here 's more paperwork . Great . I 'm going to be here until Thursday . In just three days , we were down to a skeleton crew with every bed in the hospital filled . Everyone else ran away or was in one of those beds . Everyone except the core staff . I stayed too but not because I was all that dedicated , I just didn 't understand what the hell was going on yet . Where 's Chef ? I don 't know but we 've got plenty of coffee . I just want to go home , eat some ice cream and sleep for a week . I think I 've got ice cream at my place . Hmm ... Chocolate ? Yeah , I think so . But if not , you could always put your clothes back on and go home . No one gets me naked ... ... without a ring , pal . That is so ... so ... Un-constitutional . Tha  s how I filter out the losers . I see not everyone left . Good . A little Chicken Pox outbreak isn 't going to make me run home crying . I  s Pox . Whatever . And i  s not just Small Pox - this strain isn 't responding to conventional treatments . Nothing works on it . Wait . I 've been here for three days and you 're telling me nothing works ? I could have been playing baseball ! Just make the patients as comfortable as possible . This is something new . Pediatrics already lost three nurses to this so don 't think we 're not all at risk . It may not be airborne but you can get it from any one you touch . Understand ? Back upstairs and on the clock in five ? No . What ? You come into direct contact with all the dead bodies in the hospital . I wear gloves , okay ? What ? Stupid Chicken Pox ! You did this ! Lady ! Lady ! Get off him ! Everything 's going to be okay ! She , she must have just gone over ... I didn 't see that coming . It looks like once fever cooks the brain , you can add violent dementia to the list of symptoms . Cover her up . Huh ? She 's dead . Move ! What happened here ? We got word back tonight from C.D.C. And ? It looks like this bug has got a ninety-nine point nine percent mortality rate . Ninety-nine point nine percent mortality rate ? That can 't be ! I 've got ten patients in the clinic that have lasted over forty-eight hours now . I know they 're wrong ! And what about the guy down the hall that can still see , he 's got - the pox scars and everything . - Genetic luck of the draw . Tha  s all . There might even be someone out there tha  s immune to this thing but i  s going to be a one in a billion case . You know what ? I 'm not a doctor or an R.N. , I really do not need to be here , okay . You can 't hide from this . Sooner or later , we 're all going to get this . I  s just a matter of time . I didn 't stay at the hospital for humanitarian reasons , I just wanted to be around Eva . The whole world was dying from plague but she was still there helping people to the end . Now , I know I fell in love with her during that time . Eva was an angel in my eyes . The only real hero I ever knew , well , besides Dr. Adrian . I 'm not just idealizing her , she really cared about people , people she didn 't even know . Once Dr. Adrian died , I was so out of there . I knew there wasn 't any hope at the hospital anymore . But I stayed anyway , I stayed to be with Eva . Doctor ! Are you okay ? No , I 'm not okay ! Wha  s going on ? The National Guard came and took all the bodies away - in garbage trucks ! How disgraceful ! Garbage trucks ! The National Guard ? Yes . They 're burning them outside of town , like garbage ! Well this is Doctor Adrian . They 're going to burn him like garbage too , believe me . Put him outside with the others . But i  s Doctor Adrian ! I said put him outside ! Halt ! Do not move ! No , no ! I work here , I work here ! Inside ! Get back inside Back inside ! As best as I can remember from the news , it was a biological weapon that the Soviets developed in the 1980 's . It was the " Doomsday Bug " with a sixty-six day incubation period so it spread to everyone , everywhere before anyone even knew it existed . Everyone already had it , even the Jihadists who released it . Tha  s how the whole world ended in just three weeks , if it really matters to anyone . It was obvious the hospital was history . All I wanted to do was take Eva with me and get far away from everything diseased . - Doctor Adrian is dead . - No ... My whole family lives up in Phoenix . I need you to come with me , Eva . No . I  s too late . I 've got it . I want you to come with me . No ! Don 't touch me ! I 'm infected ! But after I found out that Eva got it , everything fell apart . I fell apart . The end of the world got very real for me . But I never told her how I felt . I wish that she would have lived long enough so I could have told her how much I loved her , so I didn 't have to carry those feelings around with me to this day . Eva ! I never found out whatever happened to Eva after she disappeared . I still have nightmares of running endlessly through the hospital looking for her but never finding her . - Doctor ... Doctor ... - Help me , help me ... Doctor , listen ... Who 's there ? I  s Lionel Verney . Oh , Lionel ... Have you seen Eva ? Maybe they took her to , to the pit . I don 't know for sure , I can 't see ! Is there any records or anything ? Doctor ... Doctor ... Doctor ... Adam ? Listen , have you seen Eva ? She 's dead . You 're next ... You 're lying . You 're lying ! Don 't let him leave ! He can see ! He can see ! Verney ! Stop following me ! The Diseased chased me for a few blocks before I lost them . I thought I was going to die just like everybody else but I was immune . I had no idea what happened to the outside world . The hospital I was living in was like a cocoon . You see , not all of the Diseased were blind . I saw one that could still see . He took down a group of three blind Diseased and cut one of them into pieces before he could even scream . I  s okay , i  s okay . I can help you . - I can see ! - Help me ! Help me ! Don 't let the Butcher get me ! Please don 't let the Butcher get me ! Come on , which way ? I helped one of the Diseased home before he got killed too , I was so stupid . Thank you ... Thank you ... Please , take me inside , take me inside . He brought me to the storefront where he was living with a group of other Diseased who were all blind . The keys are in my pocket . Let me in , please let me inside ! No way , I 'm not going in there ... I 'm sorry . He can see ! Get him ! Get him in there ! Let me go ! Damn it , you 're infecting me ! Get him ! Eat him ! Eat him ! They cracked me over the head and dragged me into their filthy nest . They were all cannibals . They turned to feeding off the corpses of the ones who died from starvation after the food stopped coming into the city . They must have finished off the cats and dogs first . I haven 't seen any roaming animals since then , not even rats or pigeons . Take his pants and shoes so he can 't get away . Where is he ! Where is he ! Where is he ! I 'll kill him ! No one touches him ! He can see ! Where is he ! He can see ? He can see ... I didn 't kill your brother . Why would I bring him here ? Who will be left if we continue to feed on one another ? We need him . Rober  s flesh will spoil soon . Then we will starve . So tonight , you will take us to a supermarket . If you refuse , you will be our only food . All right ! All right , I 'll take you . Tha  s right you will ! I 'll take you right now . They were sick and needed help but all I wanted to do was kill them . I mean , I felt guilty for my lack of sensitivity but I felt nothing but revulsion for them . It made me sick to even look at them , smell them or even listen to the phlegm rattle in their voices . But deep inside , I knew there wasn 't anything human left in them . He 's taking us to the burning place ! - Shut up ! There 's no smoke ! - He 's taking us to the pit ! He 's taking us to the pit ! I  s a trap ! I  s a trap ! Once the sun came up , the stink rose with the temperature . The population of Tucson before the plague was about a million people . I don 't know how many corpses the National Guard carted out of town but it smelled like the most blasphemous stench that ever soiled my sinuses . In the daylight , I saw how bad it was . I don 't know how many corpses were clustered beside any source of water . Some fell over and sprayed their guts up right there on the spot , wherever they fell over . Dying from the plague was a pretty gruesome way to go . Pain all the way to the end . The stench was so suffocating , I ran back to the baseball stadium where I knew the air was still clean and smelled like fresh grass . Baseball season was over , permanently . At least the terrorists who did this died the same gruesome death as the human race . I thought I was the last living creature left alive in the whole city . I don 't know why but I was suddenly overcome with claustrophobia and had to leave that stadium . And tha  s when Ray found me outside of the Tucson Electric Park in my underwear , standing there like some crazy person . I didn 't know it then but he thought I was diseased and just stopped to put me down with his 12 gage . Excuse me , you haven 't seen any women around here lately , have you ? No , I 'm serious . No , I haven 't . Wha  s your story ? I thought I had the whole city to myself . Well , except for those roving gangs of crazies that come out at night . Say , you 're not crazy and messed up , are you ? Oh , no . Well , tha  s good . I  s getting kind of late . Are you going to be okay out here by yourself tonight ? I didn 't think so . Get in . I 'm Lionel . I 'm Ray . Actually , call me , " Titanicus " . Ray , he taught me everything I know . This is just crazy , isn 't it ? I was up in the sticks when all this went down . But I figured , you know what , just make it back to civilization and everything will be all right . Well , I get back to town about a week ago and I 'm like , whoa ! Total apocalypso . Where did everybody go ? Where did everybody go ? What , did you just get here ? Funny story . The other day , I 'm walking down Forth Avenue , right ? And they 're everywhere . And I see a group of them all over this poor guy . I mean they 're on him like he 's a piece of sushi . I start walking over and I feel this hand on my shoulder . So I turn around and i  s one of those " things " , he could see me . I mean he couldn 't see as well as you or I do but he could see well enough to know that I wasn 't infected . So they got you ? Huh ? No ! I pulled out my 45 , put it to the bastarïs head and blew his brains out all over the crowd . And it was that moment I realized , I 'm looking at this all wrong . I need to see it as the glass half-full instead of half-empty . You know what I mean Not really . They 're psychos , right ? So I 'm fighting fire " with fire " - i  s " psychological " warfare . ... Psychological warfare . Is this where you live ? No , we ran out of gas . What do we do now ? We go find another car . This is like the forth car I 've had this week . I change cars like I change my underwear . Come on . Shut the door . So this is your place ? I thought that you 'd get a large estate up in the foothills . I 'm trying not to draw any more attention to myself than necessary . So wha  s up with the shirt ? You want to put some pants on ? Got any extra clothes ? Follow me . This is the downtown war room . Don 't touch anything , okay ? I 've got my own little " Feng Shui " thing going on in here , so I don 't trip over stuff in the middle of the night . Here are the clothes . Take your pick . I  s all green . Yeah , you 're in a military surplus store . I hate green . It looks like he 's going to need some new underwear too . Got any shoes ? Sorry , no shoes . We 've only got boots . We 've got lots and lots of boots . Oh , crap . Did you hear that ? We 're never going to get any sleep with that going on outside , are we ? We own the day but they own the night . Not exactly . Wait , wait ! You 're not just going to go out there and start shooting people , are you ? The moment these things first tasted human flesh , tha  s when they crossed the line and as far as I 'm concerned , they 've resigned from the human race . They 're not people anymore , Jack . They 're cannibalistic , uh ... Mutants . Look at them ! Stop it ! Get your hands off me ! They 're just people . They 're sick - and they need our help ! - Oh , stop it . The twenty-first century 's over , Jack . So there 's no one left to jerk off with political correctness . This is year one and i  s us against them . And if we want to survive this thing , there 's two things we really don 't need right now . " A " we don 't need any Gays and holy crap , especially no Lesbians , they would be totally , umm , ... superfluous trying to re-populate a new world ! I 'm not done ! And " C " we don 't need any liberal stupidity trying to make us feel better about doing whatever it is we have to do to survive . Yeah , yeah . I know , I know . So stop trying to make me feel guilty about blowing the heads off a few lousy mutants , all right ! You know what your problem is ? You 're just not as " well-adjusted " as I am . We 'll get you , Devil ! Ray ! Ray , where are you ? What the hell do you think you 're doing ! Well , there is a little too much " yin - yang " in here right now and what we need is a little " zen " . How many people have you killed ? Forty-five caliber , 1911 automatic . Read that . How many people have you killed ! Here it is . M-16 assault rifle . Keep this on you at all times . How many people have you killed ! I don 't know , forty-five , sixty . I really wasn 't keeping score . Do you realize that they call you the " Devil " ? Yeah , i  s part of that " psychological warfare " thing I was telling you about . Why does this have to be about war , huh ? Why can 't we go out and help those people ? Oh , here it is . Sun Tzu . The " Art of War " . I expect you to read this one , cover to cover by the end of the day tomorrow . Now , you 're tired and I need some quality alone time . He 's a freaking nut-case . And this ... Is your new home . Sleep tight , Jack . That crazy bastard . So , you read Sun Tzu . Any questions ? Why did you hack up my hair ! Just trying to dial down that " Village People " look you got going on there . Don 't you ever , ever touch me again ! Or what ? You 'll shave my legs ? Don 't make such a big deal about it , Jack . My name is not Jack ! I  s Lionel ! Lionel Verney ! I 'll tell you what , if we ever do run into any women , please let me do all the talking . Is that what you 're doing here ? You 're trying to pick up women ! I know what I 'm doing here , what are you doing here ? Don 't be such a Neanderthal ! Actually , you 're the Neanderthal . You know , a month ago , they would have medicated you . But now , this world is a kook 's paradise and I 'm stuck in it with you ! I 'm no kook , Jack . I 'm earth 's last , best and only hope . And who are you , the mutan  s best hope ? You know what , I 'm going back down . History lesson , Jack . We only became the dominant species because we made the Neanderthal extinct but you don 't feel too bad about that , do you ? The exact same thing is happening right now , only you 're dropping the ball on the entire human race . Better get with the program , Jack , or you 're going to be just as extinct as the Neanderthals , buddy . Ray and I really started to get on each other 's nerves until things went to blows by the third day . I was keeping track . You were keeping track ? Of what ? How many shopping days left until Christmas ? You know what ? That is the last wise crack I 'm going to take from a " Neo-Con " Neanderthal ! Or you 'll do what ? You stupid , Liberal nut sack ! You made me do that . Nice shot . You 're such an idiot , you know that ? Get up . Get up ! I can 't . Why ? I ... I don 't know . Your ribs ? Uh , yeah . Don 't try anything stupid , do you understand ? You 're infected ! So now you know ... Why the hell didn 't you tell me ? Why do you think I brought you here ? You 're such an idiot . We 've only got a couple of days for me to teach you everything I know . A couple of days ? You have hours to live . Are you sure about that ? I 've seen a hundred of these people . I work in the medical field , I should know . Get me my vodka . I can 't believe you . Go get me my vodka . I can 't believe you . And read the book , Lionel ! What ? Swear to me you 'll read the book ! Yeah , whatever . The next day , I buried Ray in the park under the shade of the palm trees . Okay I 'll read the book . Now shut up ! Once he knew he had the plague , he saved the human race the only way he had left . I still miss him . Ray stockpiled everything but food . After three days without eating , I was so hungry , hungry enough to go look for anything I could find . The stores were all picked clean , so I started looking inside deserted apartments and buildings . I found food but I almost didn 't make it out of there alive . Someone 's here ! They 're stealing our food ! Only the municipal power grid was powered by the big nuclear power plant out in the desert . Everything else was fed from the power plants in town . The street lights still worked until the bulbs burned out . But I was going to be living in the dark once the generator ran out of gas . There were no more washing machines . When I needed clean clothes , I just pulled something off the rack . I smelled a little better but I still didn 't have any food in my stomach . I couldn 't just lay there and starve when I knew there was food out there waiting for me . The only thing standing between me and starvation were those Diseased people . A lot of them . I beat myself up because I could have taken Ray 's gun with me . I could have been eating that night , if I knew how to use it . Everyone is afraid of guns , even the Diseased , so I sat up all night , learning how to use that pistol . You want to steal our food ? Not all of it . Anything but dog food . Let me show you what we do to thieves . Can you see this ? We have guns too . Drop it ! Drop it ! I will shoot you ! Now you can eat them . Don 't try anything stupid . We know who you are ! We know where you live ! Those diseased were mostly blind . They had no chance against me . The Diseased knew where I lived so they burned me out the very next day . I knew they mistook me for Ray because someone painted " burn the devil " on my door . Ray must have made a lot of enemies . I wandered the city looking for a car with keys still in the ignition . I wanted to drive up to Phoenix where my parents lived to find out if they survived too . If wasn 't affected by the plague , maybe they weren 't as well , if it was a matter of strong genes . I also want to leave the stench of death hanging over Tucson behind me . I followed the smoke rising in the distance to the pit where the National Guard were stationed . If anyone was still alive , I thought it would be them . But all I found were bodies , all dead from plague . Almost a million bodies were cremated in hundreds of garbage containers . Just the month before , I was sitting behind all of them in traffic , cursing at them for driving slow in the fast lane . I didn 't know what I would find up in Phoenix so I armed myself with a few grenades and an automatic rifle . The body armor wasn 't a bad idea either . For all I knew , Phoenix was ten times more dangerous than Tucson . I stayed off the interstate . I thought it was probably jammed with cars and roadblocks , so I raced up the back roads . Half way up there , Phoenix was gone in a thermonuclear flash , along with my family . Oh , my God . My God . My God . Phoenix ... The blast was so strong , even 50 miles or so away , it flipped my Hummer all the way over . I wouldn 't have survived if I was driving anything smaller . The suspension was totalled and the engine quit working . Phoenix was gone , so I had to make the long walk back to Tucson on foot . I knew it wasn 't a good idea to walk through nuclear fallout but neither was sitting in the Hummer breathing it in all day . If my family wasn 't already dead , I 'm sure they were now . Who the hell would do something like that ? What the hell happened ? It was a mystery . I must have walked about ten miles before I passed through the aircraft graveyard where they stored all of the mothballed jets in the desert . I wish I knew how to fly , I could have just climbed in and flown any one of them anywhere . Maybe there were survivors just like me in Mexico or Canada ? I had just seen a nuclear blast and lived , one of mankinïs greatest scientific achievements and there I was walking under the shadows of the giants that could fly around the world as fast as a bullet and they just sit here , like dinosaurs . I wondered if these jumbo jets would be just as impressive as the pyramids in a thousand years , now that mankind has been thrown back into the stone age . A desert full of Dinosaurs . Where there 's a corpse , there were always car keys . And sometimes , even a full tank of gas . The dead didn 't bother me anymore , it was the Diseased who weren 't dead yet , lurking in every shadow , that bothered me . I  s amazing what you can get used to . When I got back into the foothills , I decided to stop and check out one of those big fancy houses that I always wondered about , just to see for myself how the other half lived . I never left . I made it my home , I claimed it . This palace was my new home . I wish Eva had been able to enjoy it with me . I had to stop thinking about her , she 's dead and crying over her wasn 't going to bring her back . I knew that . They say , idle hands are the Devil 's workshop and there 's something to that . In just two weeks of living alone by myself , I completely broke down . I couldn 't stop thinking about Eva . Wasn 't this everything she could possibly want out of life ? Living here like this ? This is so unfair that I would have everything I ever wanted , all that meant nothing to me all by myself , without her or anyone else to enjoy it with . So I drank myself into oblivion to numb my despair . I fell asleep drunk , woke up drunk , just to get drunk all over again before cycling through the same old thoughts that made me want to get drunk all over again . After a while , I couldn 't keep any food down . I didn 't care . Everyone I ever knew was gone . My whole world was gone . I had nothing to live for and I just wanted to be with everyone else , on the other side . Heaven . Whatever that means . Where ever everyone else went . I couldn 't stand being alone anymore . I was going to check out like Ray . I think sometimes you have to give up your old life before you can start a new life and I had to start all over , leaving everything I once was behind . That was the last day of Lionel Verney . Just like ray said , i  s " us against them " like when we made the Neanderthals extinct . So I started reading Sun Tzu 's " The Art Of War " every day until I knew how I was going to exterminate the Diseased so humanity could get a fresh start . I went back to the pit and armed myself then I stashed those weapons in the trunks of cars strategically throughout the city . Then I was prepared for a prolonged war , at times and places of my own choosing . I still had to train myself to kill them without any hesitation , just like an exterminator spraying a nest of roaches . I looked one right in the eyes the first night and I killed it . That helped get me past thinking of them as people . That first night of the war , I left a clear message . I let them know that the Devil was back in town . After that , they began to hide . And I knew they were afraid . The diseased who could still see went out at night , scurrying in the shadows like rats , too terrified to go out during the day because of the " Devil " . I sniped at them from rooftops , in the alleys they once thought were safe . I blew off so many heads that I became very bold , and stupid . One night , they baited me and almost got me . They lured me into a trap and I had to fight for my life . I  s a good thing they 're in such bad physical shape or I 'd be dead by now . I read Sun Tzu twice but I still didn 't understand it all . Back then , I couldn 't help but see the diseased as people sometimes , even if they weren 't really people anymore . They 'd kill me if they had the chance , so don 't feel sorry for any of them . They 're all diseased , psychotic cannibals . But I didn 't know if I could kill the very young ones then , until one night , I saw them eating a corpse 's organs like it was " Night Of The Living Dead " . Shooting it was the most merciful thing I could do for them . I know that sounds really twisted but it was merciful . Believe me . I must have killed at least 100 of those things in the first few months . Back then , I thought I killed them all off because I rarely saw them out in the open anymore . But the corpses kept disappearing , so I knew that they weren 't all dead . After they ate all the cats and dogs , they cannibalized the blind , the weak and the frail . Not all of the Diseased were blind and crippled . The best fed ones were almost healthy , not like me but still healthy enough to be dangerous . I took back all the high places from the Diseased . But I never found any of them above the second floor of any building . It must have been too painful for them to climb many stairs . Anything above the third floor in any building would make a safe place to hide if I ever found myself out-numbered or cornered . By the end of the first year , I lost count of how many of those things I killed . I thought I was invincible and I got careless exterminating so many every week . What I didn 't count on was the ratio changing . I mean , once the blind and weak ones were all gone , all that were left were the strong ones who could still see , to some degree . It was a lot more dangerous than I realized . I found out that they were now hunting me down . That took me completely by surprise . I made so many stupid mistakes all at once , i  s a miracle I 'm still alive . If the diseased were hunting for me , I could use that against them somehow . Sun tzu said , " To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands , but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself . " And I would give them that opportunity . He hides behind locked doors . He 's up there , in the light . I began setting traps for them because I knew if I could kill off their strongest , their numbers wouldn 't mean a thing . Sun Tzu said , " A general is skillful in attack when his opponent does not know what to defend ; and he is skillful in defense when his opponent does not know what to attack " . I doubt the leader of the Diseased ever read Sun Tzu but who is leading them ? I stopped mourning Eva around this time because I became too consumed with planning my attacks to think about her anymore . It was a welcome relief to feel ... Nothing . I went back to the pit where the gasoline trucks they used to burn the bodies were parked . Sun Tzu said , " When the force of the flames have reached its height , follow it up with a swift attack on your enemy " . If I couldn 't find out where they were hiding , I would have to destroy every dark place in the city they might use to hide and begin a fire storm that spread throughout the warehouse district . The warehouses had basements ; the Diseased preferred those old buildings because they were easier to defend than a business or a residential building . But I knew they were all fire traps . I used that to my advantage . Sun Tzu said , " If your enemy is taking his ease , give him no rest ; if his forces are united , separate them ; attack him where he is unprepared ; appear where you are not expected . In almost two years of war , I thought I had killed off at least a thousand of the Diseased . I should have kept a body count because there were still some out there I didn 't know about until I stumbled right into them . When I found them like that , I 'd kill them deader than hell . You 're not stealing our food ! I don 't want your food . Take our food ! Take our food ! Stop shooting ! Stop shooting ! If there were any Diseased left , I thought they can 't be much more than a handful but something went wrong . They started taking pot-shots at me . It wasn 't just one sniper but it wasn 't a coordinated attack either . I  s a good thing their vision isn 't what it used to be or I 'd be dead right now . I couldn 't let them get any more organized than they already were . They only needed to get lucky once . I didn 't know how they got those machineguns , I didn 't leave any behind at the Pit . Burn ! All of you burn ! So I burned and kept burning every place in the city they could possibly hide but they are still out there . Only the most cunning and strongest of them are left . I hope i  s only a few of them . My luck may not hold out any longer than my ammunition . The Diseased have discovered my weapons stockpiled around the city . They 're now using my own weapons against me . I 'm down to only a few weapons , everything else is gone . Tonight , I either win this war or I lose it . I know that someone has to have organized them . Lfirst have to identify their leadership then destroy them . That is my plan . Wipe out the leadership then mop up the few that remain . There can 't be that many left , probably no more than a dozen of their strongest . I know that God has spared me alone for this holy purpose . I may be the Devil to the Diseased but to the human race , I am the divine instrument of deliverance . All the odds are against me but I am not afraid . I know that this has always been my purpose . I will go down from this mountain and destroy my enemies . But first , I will pray to my God for the strength and the courage to do this great and terrible thing . I am just one man but while the Diseased labor to move and strain to see , I will strike down at them , like lightning , with the fury of the archangel . Who are you ? I 'm the Devil . Who 's your boss ! The Butcher ! Well you tell the " Butcher " that I 'm coming for him tonight and there 's nothing he can do about it . Do you understand ? Now get out here ! Now ! I don 't know what will happen from this point on . So I am leaving this last page blank but I will later record my victory against the Diseased . But if this last page is never written and no one ever reads these words , then you ghosts of humanity will know that I lost the battle to save the human race and this journal is the obituary of our kind . What are you doing in here ! The " Devil " is coming to kill you ! Anyone who stays here will die ! So you led him right to me ! Get out of here before I kill you ! And leave the " Devil " to me . I also pray that I will not be , The Last Man . You were caught in the act of cannibalism . You understand why the penalty is so severe , don 't you ? Your rules mean nothing without food ! Your clan is mine , witch . Your " civilization " is over . Everything that was yours is now mine . Where 's the Butcher . Where 's the Butcher . I can 't hear you , I can 't hear you ! I 'm not going to ask you again . This is your last chance . Where is the Butcher ! Where is the Butcher ? The Butcher ! Thank you . Oh , ho , ho . Come closer ... Over here , devil ... No , don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Please ! Eva ! No . Stay back . No , no , no don 't . Eva , is it really you ? Leave me alone ! No , Come with me . Come with me , Eva ! No ! Eva , Come on ! Come on , Eva , le  s go now ! No ! No ! No , let go of me ! Eva ! Come on ! Let go , please ! - Come on ! - Please leave me alone ! Let go of me ! Hold tight , baby . I 'll get you out of here . I can 't believe i  s you Eva . Are you hurt ? Did you get hit ? I  s me , Lionel . So you 're the " Devil " . Lionel Verney , the nightmare plaguing my people . No . I 'm still Lionel , the last " human being " at large . Don 't you know what you 've become ? You 're a monster . I do what I have to do , to eat and stay alive . The right for humanity to survive . I wish that you survived I have survived . I 've been reborn . Reborn ? Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately ? I led over a thousand of my people before the Butcher took them from me . This is who I am and who I will be again . How many have you killed to steal their food ! I don 't keep count . Well I keep count . And you killed four hundred and sixty-six of my people . You 're the evil one . Not us . Your " people " are nothing but diseased cannibals . They deserve to die . You 're lucky I didn 't kill you . You came to kill the Butcher and you had him , but you let him go . Why ? Because finding you was more important . You threw off my plan . I can deliver him directly into your hands . Now , why would you do something like that ? Wha  s in it for you ? The scars the plague left weren 't only on the skin but on the brains and organs of many . Insanity , impotent men , barren women . The Butcher is a cannibal and tha  s why he must die . And tha  s why I want you to kill him . But tha  s what you want too , isn 't it , Lionel ? You , and me , together , we can lead them but you must stop killing my people . Can 't we find a way to live together ? It can be ours , you and me . If we could just stop the pain and misery . I 'm sorry but this is necessary . You 'll get your chance to kill the Butcher . I promise you that ! Step aside . Lionel , can you hear me ? Do you want to live through this ? Then first there is something you need to do if you want my help . Yeah . Just give me a minute . Listen very carefully . You have to kill the Butcher in front of the whole clan . He 's out on the balcony . Do you understand me ? You 're going to get me out of here right now . You wouldn 't make it past the guard without my help . What do you want from me , Eva ? Only three of our women remain fertile . But I 'm not one of them . The plague left all of our men sterile . All the men , except you , Lionel . How do you know ? I could tell , You reacted ... Tha  s why I brought you here . You 're the only successful mutant I 've seen , maybe the only scar-free mutant in the world You 're wrong . I 'm not a mutant ! ... You haven 't been exactly human , for a while now . You weren 't immune , you 're just a successful mutant . One in a billion . You 're a genetic wonder . And now you have the chance to save wha  s left of the human race with your undamaged genes . You can become the father The father of what ? Freaks ? I don 't think so . You , Lionel , are the one in a billion case that Dr. Adrian talked about . There 's no war left to fight , my dear friend . The killing stops tonight , after the Butcher is gone . The cannibalism ends and we can raise a healthy , unscarred generation . Outside , those three women are waiting . Tell me I can send them in to you and then you can kill Victor and be the patriarch that butcher could never be . With three mutants ? No . Hell no ! I  s not just your life in the balance , i  s all of humanity . You need to do this to save mankind . On your decision , we all live or die . After you 've fertilized the women , I will take you up to the balcony and you will kill the Butcher . Don 't be afraid . You are blessed to be the matriarchs of our people . No ! I saw him . He 's going down sixth street but he was a little too fast for me . He 's heading north on sixth . Do you hear me ? North on sixth . Shut the hell up , I 'm not blind ! I 'll find the Devil and kill him ! Do you know who I am ? Then move . You hear that ? Hurry up ! I know . We only got one shot at this . I can see them coming , hurry ! They 're coming , hurry ! They 're behind you , run ! Get in the plane , get in the plane ! Who are you ! Who are you ? Talk ! Talk ! What are you doing here ? Where did you come from ? What are you doing here ? Say something ! Tha  s a nuclear bomb , isn 't it ! Hell yeah , i  s doomsday ! No ! Don 't touch him ! Here 's your one in a billion female , Lionel . And she came to kill us all . She 's just like you , a monster , a creature of contempt ! Can you fly this thing ? Le  s go ! Come on , Eva ! Eva , come now ! Eva ! - Go ! Now ! - Eva ! Eva ... You were more human than I ever was . I am a monster . Five minutes to blast ! Get up here ! Don 't touch that ! Don 't touch anything ! We don 't have time to climb , hang on ! I 've never been this close to a blast before ! Are we landing ? No , we 're crashing ! Pull up ! Go left ! No , I mean right ! Oh , no ! No ! Wait until the fallout settles . How long is that going to take ? Six , twelve weeks ? Do we have any food or water ? No . Are there any other survivors ? No . Just you and me . We didn 't think we 'd find another immune case like us . Like you . What do you mean , you 're " immune " ? I was never infected . I 'm not a Scab . I 'm completely human We both have it , lady . You 're infected , aren 't you ? Everybody has it , including you . I  s just that some of us survived it a little better than others , tha  s all . Six weeks ? We 're not going to survive six weeks . No way . We 're going to die . We have to leave . Scab ! Don 't touch me , you 're infected ! I  s just you and me , disease or no disease ... But it really doesn 't matter , does it ? Your genes are corrupt ! You 've degenerated into something subhuman ! Listen ! Listen to me , I thought I was immune too but we both have it . Don 't you understand ? Stop it ! Listen , don 't you understand ? We are what we hate . It turned us into genocidal maniacs . We might be the last two people in this world . This has got to end now ! No ! We took out L.A. , San Francisco , Phoenix , we killed millions of Scabs so that you wouldn 't inherit the world ! Let humanity die off with dignity . Get out ! Get out ! Ray ! You were wrong ! It was never " us against them " . We self-destructed ! What did you think ? We were going to make little Scab babies together ? At least I know what I am , I 'm still human ! You don 't even know what you are ! You 're wrong . I 'm a man ! Eva was right . That woman in the plane is exactly like me , normal looking on the outside but diseased on the inside another blood-thirsty monster . I believed that I alone was spared to carry out this divine purpose , saving mankind by killing hundreds of people in the name of God but I was just committing genocide all along . I 'm not the hero I was so sure I was . A hero would have sacrificed their own life to save the lives of other people . That was Eva , not me . I answered my own prayers with self - delusion and my own hatred for those people that deceived me into believing that God wanted me to kill them all . Yes , I won the war , humanity is finished , i  s extinct ! But it was really the Devil 's jihad , just like every other genocide in history . The Diseased were different from me , so I slaughtered them , but they were still people . I systematically killed those people like I was exterminating bugs , but they were still people . Anyone who wasn 't like me , I killed in the name of God . But God had nothing to do with me killing hundreds of people in his name . God had nothing to do with me killing those last three women and sealing the doom of the human race . Now I know how bad my mind has been diseased . Now I know that I was the monster all along , I wasn 't humanity 's salvation I was its damnation . I am the Destroyer of mankind .

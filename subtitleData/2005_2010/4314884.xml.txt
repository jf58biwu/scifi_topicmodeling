 Haemorrhagic fever in smallpox . Game over . He 's got it . - MI-5 . - MI-5 , cool . Listen , we need to talk . Our friend Martin Jamieson , aka William Zanzinger was found dead in Cape Town . Hey , write this down . Bethke Labs , B-E-T-H-K-E , Labs , Cape Town , South Africa . Tell James Bond to get us all the biohazard samples he can . We knew it was smallpox two days ago when we started this . Now we 've got National Guardsmen who are sick and they were inoculated . 20,000 dead and that 's a diversion ? What the hell do they have in mind ? Numbers , numbers , numbers ! Jesus Christ . - Marburg . - Marburg ? As in war games Marburg . This doesn 't ring any alarm bells for you ? Here , from the motherland . It 's Marburg . It 's not mine . Wait a minute , this is weaponized ? It looks like they increased the incubation period of the virus . Well , I think we should keep Gamelan here for a couple of days , put her on a drip , X-rays , blood work . If I didn 't know so much , maybe I wouldn 't think that I could save Gamelan . I could just let her go . I 'm going to go back to the people I work with and tell them that this thing came from Fort Egan . Okay . The man who ended up with the viruses from Egan was Ivan Chiernegin . He was head of germ warfare research - for the Soviets , wasn 't he ? - My beloved boss . There 's been a SARS-like case reported in Denver , Colorado . The local doctors and public health officials can 't identify the virus . I don 't want to sound paranoid , but let 's hope to God this isn 't coming from the same guy who gave us Miranda . 1x12 - Resurrection It 's all pretty much the same . We 're seeing respiratory tract infections leading to pneumonia , pleurisy , as well as cyanosis . How low is the hemoglobin ? It varies . You can look at the charts . It 's basically higher in patients in the 20-40 year old range . Flu-like symptoms at first , it worsens over the course of 24 hours . Runny nose , aches and pains , in some cases diarrhea . Any poxes , rashes , lesions ? Fatality was diagnosed as pneumonia . How many in quarantine ? Well , we 've got 12 in there now . We 're running out of room . Has there been any response to medication ? Not as much as we hoped . Did you try Zanamivir or Oxycodan ? Acetaminophen ... We tried them all . We definitely think it is a new strain . It 's just not acting like any we 've had before . - Okay , let 's pick it apart . - Samples from every patient . We 're going to need a complete set of specimens from the fatality . Where are you at with your isolation protocols ? - We 're at high levels . - Bump them to critical . - Sure . - Can I set up a station in your lab ? - Of course , it 's just right this way . - Is this okay ? - Oh , you 're fine in here . - All right , I 'll catch up with you guys later . - Yeah ? - How bad is it ? You 're going to have to coordinate a press release - with the WHO and the CDC . - What have you got ? Tests so far on this virus can 't tell us what it is except it 's incredibly virulent and contagious . - Made in a lab ? - It looks natural on the outside . Is it Marburg ? So far no poxes , no internal hemorrhaging . I 'm pretty sure we can rule that out . What is it ? We 're working on it . - Okay , stay in touch . - You too . Ivan Chiernegin is Ivan Havlac . - According to who ? - David . I thought he was the scientist and I was the intelligence agent . Find Chiernegin and you 'll find the bastard who made the Miranda virus and maybe stop another potential epidemic . Wait a minute , what are you talking about here ? We 've got a bad viral strain in the States . It 's spreading fast . It could have been manufactured in a lab . Or what ? A Chiernegin lab ? Yeah . You 're getting a lot of doors slammed in your face , aren 't you ? Yeah ... Wait a minute ! What aren 't you saying ? Come on . Colin ! Come on . Do you ... Do you remember Jersey Shores ? Colin ... Navasink light station . Hum ? Don 't go there . Just indulge me , will you ? I remember it was raining , I remember we didn 't even make it to the top of the stairs . I 've got a big problem . I need your help . Sit still . What do you know about Chiernegin ? Ran the Soviet 's biochemical weapons program until 1989 . After the wall came down . Is that it ? Pretty much . You 've got to tell me . After the CIA got hold of him , they hired him to monitor the Iraqi chemical weapons program during the Iraqi / Iran conflict . Monitor it ? Iraq threw every chemical weapon they had at the Iranians during that war . Yeah , hundreds of thousands were killed , and where were the United States ? I know , I know ... Officialy , it was none of our business . So , what happened to him ? Errant cruise missile . Wiped out the entire compound . So , why doesn 't anyone want to talk about a dead guy ? I don 't know . Do you still got somebody deeper in Washington ? I might . Do want to keep me in the loop ? I will . When all this is said and done , do you want to still ... I would . Thanks , Digby . - What ? Is that it ? - Yup . That 's ... That ... Come here , listen ! This is lung tissue from a 29 year old male a day after being admitted . It 's dense tissue . - Here 's what 's a little scary . - This isn 't ? This is the patient ... a day after admittance . Five hours , temperature 's up to 101 . Eight hours , 30 minutes , the temperature spikes up to 105 , lung are 93 % filled with fluid . Jesus . We managed to keep him alive for another 4 hours . What sort of lab results do you have ? Blood cultures . They 're all pretty much consistent . PCR , mass spec . But we 're not equipped to run those tests . Okay , let me see what you got . Networking to the mainframe . - Thanks . - No problem . Do you think it might have something to do with a specific blood type ? I don 't know . Oh , interesting idea . You can read the screen from over there ? Sure . What does this say ? Go away . Bob , I 'm going to need you to coordinate a team to get going on some PCR sequences . Bob ? I 've scanned over a hundred genes so far and I 've come up empty . What are you talking about ? Scanning the canine genome to identify the genetic basis of MH . I 'm not having any luck . Bob , blood cultures . David and Jill are sending blood ... Specimens , I know . I have a team ready to do PCR and mass spectrometry work as soon as the samples arrive . Good . Okay . What are you working on ? Malignant histiocytosis . Gamelan 's been diagnosed with it . Your dog ? Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . The dog genome project has been really helpful . I haven 't heard of it . Oh . It was done by a cancer research center in the States . They are working on identifying the mutant gene that causes histiocytosis , and they think they 're about 2 years away from finding the right one . I don 't think Gamelan 's got two years . But they 've mapped out the entire canine genome . Isn 't it amazing ? So , all I have to do is compare Gamelan 's genes to a healthy map and I 'll find it . I know , there are 30,000 genes in a dog . But I might get lucky . I 'm doing random scans . I could find the right mutated gene . You could , of course . Yeah , sure . Uh , when those blood cultures come in we 're going to need you to get to work on that . Okay , of course . Bob , you know I have some free time now , maybe if you want you could give me a set of genes to scan . - Thank you , Carlos . - Okay . Thank you . Every bone ... Every bone in my body feels like it 's broken . Jesus , I feel like shit . Well , I 'll talk to your doctors and see if we can 't make you more comfortable . - You 're not a doctor ? - PhD . You 're all scientists from Canada . Somebody said it was SARS . Is that it ? Is that why you guys are down here from Toronto ? Because if I 've got SARS , I 'm going to sue . I don 't think you can sue a city that contained an epidemic . You hang in there . Thanks . Thank you . Poor guy . At least if it was SARS , we 'd know what we were dealing with . Okay , get these in a priority box to NorBAC and we 'll get back to it in 15 minutes . Thank you . - How 's it going ? - I don 't know , what do you got ? Well , they 've just admitted 3 more patients - and there 's a rumour that it 's SARS . - It isn 't SARS . More a corona virus , they 're running an ELISA test , but my hunch is it 's a type-A flu strain . But without a decent PCR run or mass spec , we can 't know that for sure . The only other useful test we can run down here is an antibody array . - All right . I 'll get on it . - Okay . Jill , I want you to go wide on that victim down in the morgue . Brain , lungs , heart . Everything . Samples of everything . Freeze them and send them to Carlos right away . David , what are you thinking ? I just want to be thorough . All right . Chiernegin . Where 'd you pull that one out of ? Well , can you tell me about him ? No . I thought you knew what was going on around here . Ivan Chiernegin was a Soviet biochemist who worked with everything from sarin to REX . He ended up working for the CIA in Iraq . As far as the United States is concerned , Chiernegin doesn 't exist . I didn 't hear it from you , Conner . After the U.S. and Iraq 's relationship fell apart , Hussein offered Chiernegin a palace on the Tigress and all the money he wanted to work for him . We knew where he was and decided to take decisive action . So , it wasn 't an errant cruise missile . It was believed that he was neutralized . Along with his wife and child . They were confirmed . Around the summer of ' 97 , Ivan Chiernegin reportedly surfaced in North Korea . A couple of years later in Pakistan , leaving behind bio-warfare programs in each country . He dropped off our radar around 2000 . Which would be around the time he dropped down to Cape Town and started to work on Miranda . When this thing first hit , this ... This Miranda virus ... people around here did get a little jumpy . Wait a minute . They knew that Chiernegin could have been behind the Miranda virus ? I don 't know , but when NorBAC first suggested that Miranda was a camel pox / ebola blend , the folks at Fort Egan went to work and compared it to their own . - And ? - Not the same . - Far more virulent than what we make . - Oh , come on Conner . Even I can make the leap . Fort Egan misplaces a milder strain of Miranda , it ends up in the hands of a Soviet biochemist with a vengeance towards the West , he ends up in well equipped lab in Cape Town , South Africa ... Yeah , it makes sense . Why didn 't anyone at Fort Egan share information with us when we were trying to figure it out ? The United States doesn 't manufacture chemical or biological weapons . Yeah , right . It can 't be . Okay ... Here we are . Sit . Come on . How are you , Bob ? I 'm fine . So , there 's nothing you can do . Bob , we could try another transfusion but it 's very unlikely that it would ... I understand . If we operated now ... I know . And even if we could take out the spleen , we can 't be sure it 's not already in her heart , lungs ... Is she in any pain ? I don 't think so . Not yet . Not yet ? Histiocytes attach and grow throughout every organ . The heart will have to pump harder , the lungs will struggle for more oxygen . What can I do ? You can take her home , make her as comfortable as possible . She 'll probably be just the way she is right now . I had a bag for her . - Her ball and blanket and bowl . - It 's in the back . You want to take her home ? I 'm so sorry , Bob . I 'll go get it . Hey . Hi . Dr. Sandstrom 's not here ? No , he left . Left ? Left where ? I assume on a plane by now , back to Toronto . Hey Joe , it 's me . Are you there ? Listen , call me as soon as you get this message , okay ? It 's very important . Oh , you 're fucking beautiful . You are one sick seal . You got it , David . The Spanish flu . - Intact . - We got it . - We got it . - We got it ! You know your terminal ? Your terminal ? You 're going to Canada , right ? Do you know your terminal ? No ... West , I think . Air Canada . Your cell phone 's ringing . Yeah ? - Was it something I said ? - What ? David , you just took off . Where are you ? - I 'm in a cab at the airport . - Why ? What 's going on ? Nothing . I just ... I need to get back to the lab . - Something 's not ... - Not what ? Not what ? David , what is it ? Nothing . I just ... Listen , finish getting all those samples okay , and then get them back to the lab as soon as you can . All right . I 'll stay on it all night . Good . I 'll see you back in Toronto . Okay , David , are you ... David ? I 'm sorry , did I scare you ? What the fuck are you doing here , Bob ? I just ... I had some work to be done and Gamelan is ... I need you to purify this blood for a PCR run , okay ? Sure . Are you running anything on the mass spec ? I had some histiocyte cells ... Okay , well this is definitively a priority . I understand . Is this from Denver ? - Yeah . - I see . David , I have a hard decision to make . Not now , Bob . I really need you to do this blood work for me , okay ? All right . David . David , did you hear me ? - What ? - When did you get back ? I don 't know . Last night . Well , how did it go in Denver ? What are you working on ? Mayko , do you need me for something ? - What 's your problem ? - I 'm busy , okay ? Hey , David . You 're back . Yes . Bob , we just received the samples from Denver . Bob , the PCR sequencing ? I already did it this morning for David . Where are they ? I don 't know . I gave them to David to read . David ... We just got the samples , Bob says that you 've already run them ? Just one . Do all the other victims . Okay , you got something or ... ? David , I got confirmation - that Chiernegin is alive . - So , find the fucker . Do you know what we 're dealing with in Denver ? You 'll know when I know , Caroline ! I don 't know . His temperature hit 104 early this morning . Lungs are filled up . None of the antivirals work . It 's been 24 hours since he was admitted ? If that . About two thirds of the people who are in there - have had their flu shot . - Got it . Well , flu viruses mutate . That 's a given . I guess the question is , can we stop it ? Yeah . Mayko ... - Here are the fragments . - Oh , okay . Thanks . Hello ? Hey Jill . We 're just trying to put together a total gene sequence now . Okay , anything panning out with David 's hunch ? Type-A flu looks like a possibility , but Jill , - we 've never seen anything like it . - That figures . Just keep on it . Is David there ? He got back last night . What is with him ? Is he acting strange ? Yeah , he 's totally intense . I mean he hasn 't come out of his office since this morning . Try and talk to him . I mean , I don 't know ... I don 't know what 's going on , - but try to talk to him , Mayko . Okay ? - Yeah , sure . - Are you on your way back ? - Yeah , I 'll be in the lab as soon as I can . Okay , safe trip . I 'll see you soon . David . David , are you all right ? - Do you want to talk ? - Leave me alone , Mayko . Leave me alone . David , you should take a look at these flu sequences . David . Joe . Joe , if you 're there pick up , okay ? I need you to go out and see if that body 's still there . You be careful , all right . Don 't touch it . I 'm serious , Vasili . Is this the Spanish flu that you dug up the northern ? I told you about Nunavut ? The vodka and the marijuana did in New York , remember ? It 's in Denver , Vasili . I think I put it there . Hey Lil , it 's me . I ... I just wanted you to know ... I love you . I just wanted to call and say that . Hey Jill , it 's me . I really need to talk to you . If you haven 't figured it out by now . Shit , I can explain . I really fucked up this time . Really ... I really fucked up this time . Call me . Okay , Sandstrom , get your shit together . You 're going to go back to the lab and tell them what 's going on . Caroline . Call Caroline . What ? We went to your house when we fucked up , my house when we were fucked up . Danny ? How about getting laid ? You want to do that ? Just keep driving the car , Danny . Do you want a drink ? Do you want to get wasted ? I am wasted . I 'm done . You don 't want to go there , man . Believe- - - It 's my fucking life . - Fine , you drive . Sit down ! I am not going to make this easy for you . You don 't know what you 're doing man . Did you when you took that bottle of pills ? Yes , I did . I had nothing left . - Yeah , well neither do I. - Get the fuck out of my cab . How bad is it ? Right now he has severe cerebral edema . I 'm calling in a specialist from Boston . He 'll be here tonight . All right . Well , we 'll monitor him overnight . Definitely no way of knowing . Other than the head trauma and a few fractured ribs and some other minor injuries . He 's very lucky . Come on , David . We 've got work to do . Hey , come on , buddy . You 're going to be okay , right ? Well hi , Gamelan . Hello . Who 's a good girl ? Hi , good girl . Hey , you 're back . Yeah , how 's it going ? We haven 't heard anything . They 're watching him tonight . Who ? You didn 't hear ? David , he was hit by a car . A cab . He 's in the hospital in a coma . What ? In intensive care . I want to keep working on things . I 'm not good at things like this . I 'm better when I 'm working , trying to fix things . Yeah , sure . I understand that . I like dogs better than people . They don 't judge , they 're not duplicitous . They can 't confuse you like people do . Mayko 's down at the hospital . She 's going to call if there are any changes in his condition . Are you going to go down there ? Yeah ... Yeah , I guess I should . Okay . Gamelan . Hey , pal . You 're looking good . You 're going to be okay . Hey , Jill . Hey , Mayko . How 's it going ? The same . Every now and then he kind of moans , but then he seems to go away . Are you going to stay all night ? Yeah . I think if I talk to him , I think he might hear me . He might answer , you know . Are you okay ? Yeah . Shit . The more I know ... I 've only known the guy 6 months . He really gets under your skin , doesn 't he ? Yeah . You want some company ? Sure . You reckon David does ? Yeah . David . When did you get here ? I don 't know . 200 . Clear . I 'm not hungry . - You have to keep your strength up . - I don 't want to . You have to get better . It 's good for you . - What is it ? - Soup . Your favorite . You made red lentil ? Eat . That 's mine . That 's the gun that killed me . That 's not for you . Go to 300 . Don 't die on me , David . Don 't die . Clear . Do you want something to drink ? Everything I do turns to shit . You don 't want to get better , do you ? No . Go to 360 . Clear . No pulse ? Alright . Come back . Can I have a litre of saline ? His volumes might be low . Check his blood pressure . Interesting isn 't it ? Very . - They 're definitely influenza-A . - I can see that . It 's the most common strain of the flu virus . Influenza-B , influenza-C , Hong Kong , Russian . - Bob . - Asian , Swine , Avian . - Bob ! - We 're not even close . Bob , slow down . I 'm sorry , I guess I 'm not very focused . Are you having a hard time concentrating with David ... ? David 's in good hands , Bob . Okay , stop . He 's going to be okay . That 's why I have to think . That 's what 'll get us through . On top of everything his dog is dying . - Good morning . - Hey , welcome back . Thank you . Where are we on the virus ? I 've sequenced 2 segments . So far nothing is hanging , and it 's no Marburg , no Miranda . Just influenza-A . It has to be . Wait a minute . This is what came out of Denver ? That 's what you sent . No . No . What ? Jill ? Jill ? Jill , what is it ? Better get ... Denver ... the WHO , every other health department on alert . This is the fucking 1918 Spanish Flu . Wes ! Fortunately this Spanish Flu is David and Jill 's life 's work . I 'm well aware of that . That 's why we were so quick to identify it . So , hopefully we 'll be able to get a head start on the vaccine . The Spanish Flu is extremely contagious . If not contained , it could turn into a pandemic overnight . Can you contain it ? Right now , there are 28 reported cases , all confined to the Denver area . That 's good . I think we should shut down all access to the Denver area . Airport , highway . No , no . That 's politically impossible . Then we 're just going to have to hold our breath a couple of days , and see if it crops up anywhere else . Caroline , do we have to use the term Spanish Flu ? It 's the strain we 've identified . - Yes , I know . But it has such a ... - Devastating connotation ? Yeah , that 'd be it . I 'll advise Denver accordingly . Thank you , Caroline , and please keep me updated . I will . And I 'm supposed to ease your mind about Chiernegin ? The Spanish Flu doesn 't just appear out of nowhere , Colin . He 's out of Cape Town , we think he 's in the U.S. Oh shit . And that 's all we know right now . What ? What is it ? There was an army 2 star general that worked at Fort Egan . His name was Ablamar . Ablamar was Hira Kahn 's direct boss when she worked at the Pentagon . I 'm pretty familiar with her history . Before that he was a liaison to the intelligence agency in Pakistan . Where are you going with this ? Well , Miranda came out of Egan . - You 're thinking Hira ? - Well , we don 't know yet . There were some issues about her past . And she did seem really familiar with Miranda . If Chiernegin got to her and she did cross a line , a man like that would want her dead . He always covers his tracks . Why wouldn 't he go after David , or this entire lab ? You 're right . I think it 'd be a good idea that we put some security around David . What are you ... what are you doing ... ? You don 't believe in this . I don 't know what I 'm doing . Yes you do . Look at you . Another one of our failures . Stop it . It killed you . It made me . It gave my brother hope . It 's wrong . It 's all wrong . It could have worked . You have no idea what I 've done . You just wanted to find an answer . What I wanted was a lot different than what I did . So , fix it . David , you can fix it . Goodbye , Dr. Sandstrom . Bye , Mick . The CDC 's widening the quarantine area . This has doubled in just the last 2 hours . They 're turning the old stables and airport into a quarantine centre . Denver proper is reporting 10 confirmed deaths , 204 people in quarantine . Lakewood has 5 reported cases . Aurora 7 . Hi . Okay , here 's what I got . These are David 's notes , from what I can tell was the beginning when he first had a line on the 1918 flu victim . He was working with a guy named Joe Okalik in Nunavut , which makes sense because the sample we worked on clearly came out of the permafrost . How did a flu in Nunavut end up in Denver , Colorado . I don 't know , but more important than that right now is we need to find the body he exhumed and make sure it 's contained . - Yeah , let 's do it . - I can 't find any dig records - or permits anywhere . - Can I take this ? - Yeah . - Thanks , Wes . That sounds like David . I 've been trying to get in touch with this Joe Okalik and he 's not answering his cell . Okay , go home , pack your long johns and catch the next flight up there . - Okay . - Fuck . What ? I don 't know what 's worse . Thinking some terrorist released this flu or that the head scientist from NorBAC did . Fuck . I know you wouldn 't leave if you didn 't have to . I know that . You 're off on a whole new adventure . And when you look back , I 'll always be there . Goodnight , Gamelan . David , if you die I 'm going to kill you . Joe , look , I need you to go out and see if the body 's still there . A male caller . Yeah , it 's my boss . - They let you out ? - I 've been trying to get in touch with him . - He 's dead . - Flu ? Denver 's already begun the antiviral treatments but nothing seems to be working . - So , how did it get there ? - I caused it , Mayko . I let it out . It 's the same fucking flu . Bu the girl she was sitting next to had contact with just about everyone who 's gotten sick . Daisy , I am so sorry . There 's no hope ? Just a corpse . Another fucking corpse . All I have are corpses . I buried my baby and I buried my parents . What kind of person would want to see another corpse ? Do you think that 's why I 'm pissed at you ? I don 't know . David , I am pissed at you because we could have had a vaccine by now . People are dying David ! You fucked up ! Subtitles : kubilai Lama Transcript : RaceMan

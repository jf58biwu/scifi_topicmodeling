 in the future , my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet , a computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has senmachines back through time ... some to kill him ... one to protect him . Today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created to change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season01 Episode03 Previously on terminator : The sarah connor chronicles . Where are we ? Same where . Different when . I want my new name , my all-new me . I 'll track down enrique . I need three sets of papers . My nephew has taken over the business . You 're in the system and everything . Uncle enrique will be proud . He referred to you as a rata- - a snitch . Why would you do this ? Because you wouldn 'T . Why not stay in the past ? You died . Two years ago--cancer . I 've seen that before . skynet work camp . Resistance fighters . you sure there 's money here . anything they valued , money , guns- - it 'll be hidden . you told me we 'd be safe . skynet doesn 't know you 're here . Thers no directive to hunt you . What if they found it , but they don 't know what to do with it ? Who the hell are you , man ? they do . when I was in the mental hospital , I became obsessed with science . Not all science , actually . And not really science at all . Scientists--and then only nuclear scientists . The ones who invented the bomb . Oppenheimer , heisenberg , fermi , and teller . Pioneers , geniuses all . I read every book I could . I wanted why couldn 't they stop , these fathers of our destruction ? And why wouldn 't anybody stop them ? And if I had the chance , would I ? Morning . - You look like hell . - Up late . Newspaper clippings ... surveillance photos , bank records . Pamphlets from every high-tech company in the state . I even thought I saw the deeds to city hall in here somewhere . Those resistance guys weren 't sent back here to be our support crew . They 're a skynet hunting party . Really ? Are you--you sure ? Most of this is still a puzzle to me , but there is one list in here I understand . Employee list , cyberdyne systems . Seems they thought it was a good place to start . And it is . She 's not gonna be happy to see you . She never is . Want me to come along ? No . You have your own job to do.A big one . You 're getting pretty good at that . Thank you . Still , it 's not exactly brain surgery or anything . Be pretty funny if you were some sort of advanced cybernetic intelligence , yet stumped by a stick of eyeliner . No , it 's not brain surgery . It would have to be a lot sharper for brain surgery . much better . When you wear clothes- - much better . Okay , six ways in . Six ways out . The front opens to the street here . Security 's minimal . Two armed guards in the morning . Four in the afternoon . And if anything goes wrong , there 's a parking lot here . Mom , it 's high school , okay ? Not supermax . We can handle it . We can handle it . Don 't you kiss me . Or anyone else . Okay , now blend in . Blend in . Yeah , I mean don 't seem like a freak . You know what I mean , right ? Freak . Weirdo . Kook.Oddball.Crackpot. Strange duck . Queer potato.Nut. I 've been reading the dictionary . I don 't sleep . Yeah , see , that 's what I 'm talking about . You do that , you sound like a freak . And don 't walk around acting like my bodyguard . You 're supposed to be my sister . You won 't fool anyone . I fooled you . What 's that all about ? Appears to be a reimagining of a trompe l 'oeil fresco . I don 't sleep . cell phones , hats , rings , and bling , take it off and put it in the basket . Cell phones , hats , rings , and bling in the basket . In the basket , people . Come on . The line keeps moving . Let 's go . Cell phones , hats , rings , and bling . In the basket . Please , keep the line moving . Thank you . Cell phones , caps , rings , and bling . Cell phones , caps , rings , and- - Again with you , missy . Excuse me . This is my sister . Extra credit for you . Look , she 's got a metal plate in her head . Really . I-it 's a big one . I fell . Hard . All right , let 's go . Cell phones , caps , rings , and bling . I thought you were dead . Well , I 'm not . Lucky you.You look- different ? - The same . Well , I can 't explain . I wouldn 't want you to . - Is john - - he 's good . Bout that machine ? She 's still around . Not that one . - The other . - No . Do you mind ? You brought it . Danny 's not here ? It 's ten years , right ? He 's at school . He hasn 't come in a long time . I 'm sorry to hear that . What do you want , sarah ? You never die , and you always want something . I need you to look at these photographs , tell me if you recognize anybody . I know it 's been a long time , but ... no . Nobody . Sorry . There 's one of them maybe involved with skynet right now . They might not even know it . Sorry to bother you . I 'll leave you alone . The fourth photo . The young one . His name is andrew goode . Andy . He was an intern at cyberdyne one summer . Miles liked him . Is he going to die too ? Is that what happens now , he dies ? I don 't know . I hope not . Well , if he does , just make sure it matters . Make sure it 's not in vain . No one dies in vain . agent ellison . They told me you were coming . But I told them the last time you worked a crime scene , hoover was cross-dressing at quantico . Ballistics . I can already tell you mine are bigger . Same gun that killed your boys here killed one of my cis . Enrique salzia . What 's the connection ? Well , he made fake paper.Your guys I hope you 're not selling the terrorist cell theory , ' cause I 'm not buying it . Why not ? Well , look at the print report . * * * * * * * * There 's nothing here . These guys were drug dealers , small-time . Definitely not worth you putting your tie on and breaking open your thomas guide . Oh , yeah . You see this every day . You didn 't find that curious ? Why would anyone wire a safe directly into the power ? Why 's the sky blue , ellison ? Don 't overthink it . The guys were druggies . They 're not rocket scientists , not terrorists . Your guy sold my guys paper . My guys whacked your guy to cover their tracks . Go back to your office . Your desk misses you . Right . Good one . Somebody came back here for whatever was in that safe . They 're out there . And I 'm gonna find them . Can I help you ? No . Andy . Just looking . You just kept looking over like you needed something . That 's the phone . Seriously , if I was gonna be alone on a desert island with only a phone for a companion , that would absolutely be the phone . Is that something you would do ? May I ? Got a four-meg camera . Texting- - true texting too . Not that sms cartoon bubble junk . 3g data access . 10 gigs free music . 6 hours of talk time and 36 standby on your battery . What happens if I press these numbers here ? 'Scuse me ? These numbers , one through nine . If I press seven of them , will someone talk to me through the ear part up here ? yeah . Okay . I 'll take three . Hello ? Are you calling me ? I was just following up to make sure everything 's okay with the phones . I just left the store . I know . Okay . Do you wanna have dinner with me tonight ? No . Well , you answered too quickly . Hear me out . Just give me one minute . - 30 seconds ? - Talk fast . Okay , well , first let me clear up the whole desert island and a cell phone thing . Seems kind of strange if you picture it . I wasn 'T . Right , of course . Why would you ? It 's an asinine sales pitch , really . There 's nowhere to plug in the phone . It would be worth le than a rock when the battery died . Couldn 't even use it to open a coconut . This is you selling yourself ? Selling myself ? Oh , I don 't know . There 's something immoral about the whole selling process . And yet , that 's your job . Part-time . And I 'm not very good at it . So I 'm actually less immoral than the average ... anyway . where was I ? You 're right . About what ? I answered too quick . - Mr. Baum . - Yes . Take your seat , please . Okay , paper and pencil out . Time for a pop quiz . Here . Come in . I said come on in . I 'm transferring in . Okay . Any open seat . What part about don 't act like a freak didn 't you understand ? Sit down . - So ... - so ? Like I said on the phone , your sweet uncle enrique lived a colorful life . One we have not yet painted in full . You grow apart . Every day 's a new adventure . Who can keep up ? I got an uncle who 's like a father . I also got one who 's like a stranger . How ' bout you two ? More like an a aunt . Chatty , chatty . All right . So you 're not too close . But he did call you three times the day he was murdered . What 'd you chat about ? Well , those lakers . Really ? What about ' em ? Kobe . He 's the bomb . I always thought he was a ball hog . He 's all alone , man . He 's got no one else who can shoot . Is that you , carlos ? Now that your uncle 's dead ? You all alone ? Yeah ... all these boys can shoot . - I didn 't kill my uncle . - No . And you 're too smart to know nothing about who did . I 'll be in touch . No , I-I know . The guy 's 18 months ahead of the germans . Yeah , well , I would if I had that kinda grant money . No , I 'm not saying the guy 's a complete idiot . But it 's not exactly avant-garde science , is it ? I mean , why don 't they give the money to the people on the cutting edge ? But they never do . They never- - How was school ? I have a metal plate in my head . She 's gonna need a note . I meant you , not her . Yeah , fine . You 're not gonna give me anything ? We went , we learned . I didn 't get killed . She didn 't kill anybody . It was a pretty good first day , I think . What about you- - did you go ? I did . And how was she ? Surprised to see you weren 't dead ? More like disappointed . She id 'd one of the safe house photos . - Intern at cyberdyne . - Really ? So what does he do now , work in a lab or build rocket guidance systems or something ? Cell phone salesman . Shut up . Cell phone salesman . And not a very good one . These need to be cleaned . Okay , so about the cell phone guy . I-I 'm having dinner with him tonight . Dinner ? What do you mean , like a date ? Not a date . Are you going to kill him ? Kill him ? I don 't know the first thing about him . He interned at cyberdyne when he was in college . His photo 's in a pile of photos . Nobody dies till I say so . Tell her . People die all the time . They won 't wait for her . I fooled you again . who are you ? How did you find me ? What--what do you want ? Are you a veteran ? Is that what this is about ? Do you speak ? Read that . H-how did you ... no , no , no . That 's not possible . That 's an epidermal growth rate . That 's just not sustainable . Keratinocyte and- - a-at that rate , you couldn 't possibly maintain cell regulation or differentiation . I-it 's impossible . Possible . Woo was wrong . Thomason was wrong . I was- - I wasn 't even close . Can you do it ? Well , I-I-I 'd have to go to my lab . There 's a whole mix of growth rates , uh , tgf beta , uh , pdgf , egf . I 'd need ... you know , there 's a lot of equipment . Oh , and blood . We 'd need , um , at least0 units . Preferably with tissues comprised of- - I brought my own . Can you do it ? Yes . Yes , I can . in 1943 , the german physicist werner heisenberg delivered a physics lecture to a packed hall in zurich . One of the audience members was moe berg , an ex-professional baseball player working as a spy for the O.S.S. Berg 's task was to listen to the lecture and determine whether heisenberg and the germans were close to perfecting the atomic bomb . If berg discovered that this was the case , he was to wait for heisenberg outside the hall and shoot the scientist in the head . He had never killed anyone before . So what 's your deal , andy ? I can 't imagine you majored in cell phone sales at college . No . No . More like funions and 12-packs of jolt from the vintage soda store while my roommates and i hacked zelda iii so the princess would say funny lines ripped from reruns what 's that language you speak , boy ? Computer science . Caltech . Advanced ... dorK . And what would you do with a computer degree from caltech ? I don 't know . I never got one . Really ? My father died senior year . Mom went a little off the rails . I dropped out to help . I 'm sorry . That was a long time ago , but ... thanks anyway . She 's good . She married the security guard at her bank . You have family ? Distant . Don 't take this the wrong way , but as a cell phone salesman , I think I can ask . Did you ever wanna be anything other than a waitress ? Yes , I did . What was it ? I can 't remember . What 's this , andy ? Oh , isn 't it great ? That is the official promotional poster for the kramnik deep fritz match . Awesome match . Just awesome . Most people cite the ' 97 kasparov / deep blue as the watershed man versus machine chess match . But , uh ... fritz would have wiped the floor with blue just like kramnik did with kasparov . Besides , the other poster 's impossible to find . What is it you do , andy ? Do you wanna see ? Yes , I wanna see . All right . Be * * * * The turk . The turk . Well , not the original turk . The original turk was an automaton constructed and unveiled in 1770 by the baron wolfgang von kempelen . It played chess . Is that what your turk does ? It plays chess ? I know that sounds boring as hell . Most people think so . But maybe I should put it this way . My turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player that has ever lived and probably ever will live . That 's not bragging , really . A number of ais can do that now . But the ai chess platform is very valuable for artificial intelligence developers these days . What ? I thought I saw someone outside . Uh , yeah , it 's a prowler . Back porch . It 's the police . There 's been some break-ins in the neighborhood . - My- - - I have to go , andy . No , sarah , wait . It 's 165 mesrow . Sarah ! Again- - what did it look like ? What did it look like ? Who cares what it looked like ? It was just a rack of computer equipment . Okay , but was there obvious network access ? Do you know what kind of bandwidth ? You 're joking . What about power supply ? Was there a cooling element , like a fan or something ? John . Mom , I 'm just trying to get a sense of the horsepower . I wanna know if this thing was A ... dinky little homemade soap box or if it was a full-fledged ai platform capable of learning and growing and taking on other applications . It plays chess . So did einstein . Have you ever heard of the singularity ? It 's a point in time where machines become so smart that they 're capable of making even making smarter versions of themselves without our help . That 's pretty much the time we can kiss our asses good-bye . Unless we stop it . Like you said you would . So I caught a break on a set of fingerprints from our drug dealers . I wanted to see your face when I laid that on you . See , the only fingerprint database I hadn 't checked was kid prints . That 's no joke . That 's him--that 's one of your dead terrorists . A black-haired , brown-eyed 35-pound four-year-old boy living in canton , ohio . And that 's the look I wanted to see . Hold up . Did your crime scene guys find any peculiar blood ? I think they got all the peculiar they could stomach with these prints . Lab says some blood evidence found at my ci crime scene is almost human ... except there 's no red blood cells present . I wanna see the blood evidence from your guys . I 'll get back to you . You 're gonna ... double-check those prints , right ? On the kid in canton ? Have a party . The one thing I hadn 't thought of , the one thing nobody thought possible was the use of a synthetic oxygen carrier . By creating a synthetic spear that carries oxygen , bringing nutrients to the skin , it obviates the need for the marrow interaction . The real world applications are ... mind-blowing . It 's ready . I , uh , have a video camera . Would it be all right if- - move away . who are you ? what are you ? Sarah ? Didn 't you get my message ? I returned your call about the test results . Y-yeah , I got your message . Yeah . You 're healthy as a horse . A healthy horse . I got that from your message . I wanted to talk to you about prevention . For cancer ? What you 're doing seems to be working . Specifically . Um ... don 't smoke . Get lots of exercise . Eat leafy greens . Don 't snort asbestos I don 't meanto make light , but you 've got no risk factors . No genetic disposition . Is there anything else about your history that I should know ? No . You 've got children , right ? Yeah , I got two myself . You worry . You wanna make sure you 're always healthy and strong for them . Don 't drive yourself crazy chasing the future . We can 't predict ... you know ? We can only try and prevent . Andy , it 's sarah . - Hey . - Hi . - You going to chem ? - Yeah . - What is going on ? - No idea . she is such a skanky , slutty whore . I can 't even talk to her ever again . I love this color . It 's tight , right ? This color 's tight . What is it ? Rash . It 's so tight . I 'm a pig . I look pregnant . Does it make me look fat ? Yes . What the hell ? What 's your problem ? You asked . Bitch whore much ? I don 't understand . I said bitch ... whore ... much ? What are you looking at ? I 'm looking at you . You saw it , right ? Right ? You saw it ? It 's so ... freakin big , and right out there ! It 's freaking big . Right . It is , right ? Whoever 's doing this is such a jackass . I mean , who would do this ? And how would they even know ? My parents ... they 're gonna kill me . Kill me ! I mean , don 't we have hall monitors or something ? I mean , how could someone just- - You 're upset . No kidding I 'm upset . My life is freaking over ! Here 's a present . It 's tight . well , I have to admit , I wondered if I 'd see you again . miracles happen every day . that 's funny . That was a joke , right ? If it was funny , it was a joke . So the , uh , police recommended I put in a security system . Armed patrol , that kind of thing . Can 't really afford it , though . You think someone wants the turk ? Well , eight years of my life . Not just the software . I customized the hardware too . One month , I worked so much on a motherboard that I lost my sight for three days . No , that really happened . Those circuits are so small . A lot of the gears I actually pulled from gaming platforms . Did you know that the military uses them ? Yeah , I 've got the guts of three xboxes and four playstations daisy-chained . Plus some seriously modded-out code that I swear came to me in a dream . And all this to beat another computer at chess . None of this to beat another computer at chess . Then what ? What are you doing ? Would you believe me if I told you turk has moods ? Obviously not in the sense that you and I understand mood , but sometimes I 'll feed it a particular chess problem , and it 'll solve it one way . The next day , I feed it the same problem , and it solves it differently . Once in a while , it can 't even solve it at all . Do you know why it does that ? No . Yeah , neither do I. Someday ... I 'm gonna figure it out . Someday , turk 'll tell me . You talk about it like it 's human . Well , you never know . What ? Too far ? What is it ? Nothing . Nothing at all . Do you like this color on me ? What ? I 'm a bitch whore . What ? I have a new friend . Did she tell you you were a bitch whore ? No . She cried . Wait--what ? Okay , what the hell is this thing ? jumper ! Outside the gym ! Jump ! Jump ! Shut up . She 's not gonna jump . She 's just trying to get attention . Jump ! Dude , come on ! That 's my new friend . The crying one from the bathroom . When ? Two hours , three minutes ago . Four minutes ago . She 's upset . Her parents are going to kill her . Did you do anything to her ? I tried to give her a tight present . - We gotta help her--now ! - No . I 'm going up there . Let me go--I order you to let me go ! Don 't be a freak . Gotta go--now . I could have done something . I was right there . Maybe . Come on , mom . John , people who wanna take their own lives , this girl ... if they 're serious about it , they 'll find a way . You didn 't see her . If you 'd have seen her , you wouldn 't be talking like this . What were you gonna do , be a hero ? Get your name in the papers , your face ? Isn 't that what I 'm supposed to be ? A hero ? Isn 't that who I am ? If it 's just gonna sit inside me , if it 's just gonna sit in my gut , then what are we doing ? What 's the point ? Why not just give it to them if we 're gonna act like them ? I don 't know how to help him . Andy goode must be killed . Took his eyes , james . Took his friggin ' eyes . on july 16th , 1945 , in the mountains outside of los alamos , new mexico , the world 's first atomic bomb exploded . A white light pierced the sky with such intensity that a blind girl claimed to see the flash from a hundred miles away . After witnessing the explosion , J.Robert oppenheimer quoted a fragment ofhe bhagavad ga , declaring , " I am become death , the destroyer of worlds . " His colleague , ken bainbridge , put it another way when he leaned close to oppenheimer and whispered , " now we are all sons of bitches . " now we are all sons of bitches .

 Previously on Heroes I think Sylar 's beginning to emerge again . I 'm part of you Matt . Whatever you did to me I held on . Now I 'm inside your head . I 'm in control here not the power . I 'm not you . You son of a bitch ! Keppler ! The guy 's name is keppler . Lives in long beach . You 're supposed to be the man with the plan , remember ? I 'm not sure I 'm that guy anymore . Why 's that ? Because I 've lost my family , Angela . Maybe changing your name back to Bennet Wasn 't such a great idea after all . But they say college is for reinventing yourself . Have you ever heard of the jump push fall test ? All we need is a dummy The approximate size and weight of Annie . So where do we get our hands on a dead body ? I guess she did kill herself . I met an empath . You talk to him ? Didn 't really get a chance . Claire ? Claire , it 's Gretchen . Open up . Claire , we need to talk ! No darling , this batch isn 't for you . I think I think I found someone to fill Joseph 's shoes . I 'm going out . Wearing that ? I draw unwanted attention being myself . Haven 't worn a suit since I was a boy . My parents forced us to be prim Binding us to a life of combed hair and Shined shoes . And then I discovered I could control the very earth under my feet And I was liberated . I could be filthy . Tie still feels like a damn noose around my neck . Come here . You don 't have to leave . You know I could I could do whatever you want . No . Thank you . It 's my responsibility . Ever since Joseph died I feel like the lights don 't shine as bright in here . Feel like I 'm missing a part of myself . He was my compass . I 'm afraid of where we 're going without it . - I need it back . - I 'm sorry for your loss . But you know you cannot replace your brother . No . You don 't understand . We have a need and I have a candidate . I just want to see if he deserves a place at our table . Do you think that you might go home While you 're out there ? No . I left that life . I don 't ever want to go back again . - How do I look ? - Like everybody else . Hey . Are you peter petrelli The paramedic who saved that cop 's life last week ? - Yeah . - That was awesome man . - Here . - Thanks . What 's this ? You been served . Guess you need to be more careful when you 're saving people - hero . You expecting somebody , Parkman ? Suspect 's house is over there . How damn long does it take a judge to issue a warrant ? We are gonna get this guy , okay ? We 're gonna find the stash both get commendations . It 's gonna be a great day . Just relax . Yeah . It 's not even about that . I ... My 30-day sobriety chip . I slipped . I used . I 'm still being haunted By the ghost of all the crappy things I 've done past And it got the better of me . A.d.a. Yeah . I wish I was a ghost . It would be so much better than this hell being stuck in your miserable life ... ehh ! I mean have you seen yourself eat a burrito ? Why don 't you just get the hell out of here ? Well there 's only one way out . Which is you need to figure out how to undo what you did . Give me back my body and I will be happy To leave you stewing in your mediocrity . You 're a killer . I 'm a cop . If I have to keep you trapped inside this prison For the rest of my life So be it . You really think you 're up to the challenge ? You got no power . None . You 're annoying as hell yes but ultimately harmless . I can just ignore you until you fade away Like a bad memory . We 'll see . - We got the warrant . - Good . I want you on this job . But you 're not going into that house Until I know that you 'll keep it together . I 'm fine . Look . It 's the first day of the rest of my life right ? So I put away my ghosts and put my game face on . - Let 's go . - All right . Police open up ! Open up ! I 'll check upstairs . Parkman . I 'm not interrupting you , am I ? I 'm everywhere . Hey . Where you going ? He 's in the closet . Yeah . Your drug dealer is in that closet . What kind of cop doesn 't check a closet ? And he has a gun . You 're done . Drop it . Now ! Okay ! You 're welcome . Gretchen ? I told you that ... Dad . What are you doing here ? " Hey dad . Nice to see you . Thanks for bringing the house-warming presents . " Hey dad. nice to see you . Thanks for bringing the housewarming presents . You okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . Your mother told me About your roommate Annie committing suicide . I should have called you . I know . - I didn 't call because ... - No . No no no I ... I don 't want to put you on the spot . I just wanna make sure you 're all right . I 'm dealing with it . I 'm fine . I know that fine . It 's uh It 's not very convincing . You want to try again ? It 's not just the whole Annie thing , it 's It 's just an adjustment college . I 'm adjusting . I miss my family . I miss you . Mom . Even Lyle . What do you say we grab some lunch ? Spend a little time talk . - If you 're not busy . - No . Sounds like a plan . - Let me just go get pretty . - You look beautiful .

Yeah but I finished my paper already . - And I 'm starving . - Great . Great . Great . Hey . We can do this the easy way or the hard way . So why don 't you just tell us where you hid the drugs ? - Why don 't you ask my lawyer ? - Did he just- - I can 't believe people actually say that . You can call your lawyer after We 're done searching that house - No you can 't do that man . - We have a warrant . You attempted to murder an officer--me . So we are gonna stay here as long as it takes . Or you could just grow a pair and End this idiotic sobriety . I 'm gonna ask you one more time Stop asking . Use your abilities . I 'm gonna go check in the bathroom . Not as easy to ignore me as you thought . It 's because I ooze charm . - Looking in the wrong place . - Stop helping .

Well I remember everybody that was on that bus . You weren 't on it . What is this a scam ? You recognize my family name ? You want money ? I 'm not scamming you . Don 't need your cash . - Then what ? - Empathy . I 'm in town because of my brother Joseph . He died and There 's a lot of loose ends to take care of When someone passes . I 'm all alone now . I have to take care of our entire family . It 's my responsibility . It 's my burden . But I can 't do that on account of you . Doctor says I won 't work for months . If I don 't work I don 't feed my family . Are you the kinda man That 's going to allow my family to starve ? You know what ? this was a mistake . I 'm gonna let the lawyers handle it--good day . Working two three shifts at a time . My lawyer already checked on you . I know what it 's like to feel the pressure of obligation .

You wanted me to pick your sorry ass up out of the mud And help make you a man . Very good , detective . You found it all on your own . I 'm almost impressed . Now what are you gonna do , Matt ? Are you man enough to save her ? You were right , Mr. Bennet . This was outstanding . Thank you . You 're welcome . That mango lassi just goes right through you .

This is what I 'm talking about The girl you wrote the ransom note for . - Where is she ? - There is no girl . Little girl 's life at stake , Parkman . You don 't have a lot of time . Use your power . Use your power . Under the stairs She 's under ... She 's under the stairs . What did you do ? What did you do ! What ? Dude , what are you doing ? Parkman ! Parkman what the hell are you doing ? A girl . He killed a girl . Her body 's under the stairs . - What girl ? - The girl ! The girl 's body Mike. she 's right- - The stuffed rabbit . where 's the stuffed- - Pink stuffed I used your own power against you . You 're being sued ? This is a scam . This guy wasn 't even in that bus crash . According to my log he was . The hospital is not gonna take the fall on this . They 're gonna blame you . For what ? I 've been nothing but committed . Yeah I know . You 're everywhere . Always the first on scene . What 's that supposed to mean ? There 's a couple of people floating the theory that you cause the accidents yourself . Glory hounding . So what you-you believe them ? They ask if you 've been reckless They ask if you 've been behaving suspiciously . - You have . - Hesam , you know me . - We 're partners . - Partners ? Man , you run off the second we get on scene . I 'm your chauffeur . He was on the bus . Look . Claire , I 'm sorry if I push too hard . I push . I 'm pushy . Ya think ? You don 't want to talk . I get that . Wanted to keep a secret that got out . When I was in junior high The girls called me retching ' Gretchen . That 's a terrible nickname . Yeah , they said that I smelled like puke Because I was bulimic . Wow . I can 't believe they would make that up . Yeah . Made it up . I 'll see you around . Gretchen . I really really want to trust you But my life has been a complex series of disasters And it 's been a really really long time Since I felt safe enough to tell anyone the truth . But I 'm tired of keeping the secret to myself . So ask me anything . I 'll tell you the truth . Mr. petrelli. didn 't expect to see you again . You look like you 've been running all over the city . I need to apologize to you . You were on that bus . I made a mistake and I am sorry . Thank you . I 'm gonna make it right . No need to concern yourself . There must be something I can do . Have you ever lost a brother ? No. no I haven 't . I used to work hospice . I used to help families through the worst pain imaginable . Joseph and I grew up nearby . I thought I 'd go back home To remember the good times . Can 't bring yourself to go ? Too many bad memories mixed in with the good . My trip here started as one thing But it turned into something else . Can 't seem to find any solace anywhere . Grieving is messy . I saw it all the time . People can offer their condolences . They can tell you they 're sorry for your loss But they don 't know what it is that you 're feeling . What do you say to people ? I just sit with them Be with them . I 'd let ' em know that they 're not alone . So what made you become a paramedic ? I wanted to save lives instead of watching them pass . You 're exactly who I 'd hoped you 'd be . I 'm dropping the lawsuit . Thank you peter for everything . You know it 's not for nothing but if you Made the trip all the way out here I really think that you should visit your home . I think I will . Sorry to bother you at this hour But um I grew up here . My father used to be the butler . My mother was the maid . My brother , uh , recently passed away And uh I just Thought I could take a look around . Not here but in the carriage house . We 're actually in the middle of a dinner party . Please . This really is not a good time . Sorry for your loss . So wait you 're telling me that you 've never been drunk ? Because that 's like 85 % of the college experience . I know. it just doesn 't work on me . I heal too quickly . But the good thing is You will always have a designated driver . Can I see it ? See what ? The healing ? If that 's not crossing a line . The hand 's always the favorite . Go for it . I 've never done this before . Well I would hope not . It 's okay . Aah ! oh my god oh my god ! I 'm so sorry ! are you okay ? I 'm just kidding . I 'm sorry . That was mean . I 'm fine . I have to take this . I 'll be right back . Dad I 've got everything under control , okay ? And I told Gretchen everything about everything And I know that you 're gonna be mad . But this was my choice . It 's not just us anymore And I 'm gonna have other people in my life Friends and boyfriends And I can 't close myself off with lies . - Did you rehearse that speech ? - Yes . I wanted to get it right . No , it .. it was good. listen I , um I think I owe you an apology . I was a bit harsh earlier at the restaurant . - A bit ? - Okay . Two bits . It 's just ... When I look at you I can 't help seeing my Claire bear and , uh When you get in any kind of trouble I feel this instinct to protect you . Well you can 't do that now . I don 't think I can ever really do it again . Not like before . Look I will always be here for you . Always . But you 're right . You can handle your own problems now . And I 'll try to worry about myself from now on . Thanks . Good night , dad . Good night Claire . Good night . Can I , uh , borrow this ? No . Right . Sorry . No , I .. I mean yes . Yes , but Well you won 't have to borrow it because It 'll be here . Do you want to be my roommate ? Let me think , um Rooming with a boring girl who smells like pickles Or the supergirl who 's got excellent taste in literature . Well , all right then . Roommate I just I don 't see any other way out of this . You crossed the line man . What 's gonna happen to me , Mike ? You need to find yourself a damn good lawyer . This is gonna ruin my life . I am sorry . Yeah . Me too . What are you doing ? I guess I 'm just not strong enough anymore . Nothing happened here . He attacked you . I stopped him . That 's all . Go call it in . I 'll go call it in , Matt . I 'm proud of you . You 're finally becoming more like me . Today is the first day of the rest of your life . Now they can all be like this Or you and I can go find my body . Weird , huh . Sorry to make you boys come out . Three people died here . Could have been a lot worse . - So what happened ? - Sinkhole . Sinkhole ?

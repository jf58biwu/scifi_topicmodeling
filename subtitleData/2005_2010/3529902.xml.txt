 And finally , through a small incision in the skull the nano device is placed directly into the brain . Where , once activated , it causes everything the subject eats to taste ... sweet ! The implications for weight loss are enormous . And while an eletric brain surgery isn 't test THAT great , it still tests better than dieting and exercise . Excellent work , everybody . Thanks for staying late . Oh , shoot . What 's the matter ? My driver died a few days ago , and I haven 't got a replacement yet . Oh , I 'm sorry ... I can give you a ride home . I suppose that 's OK . But I can 't ? you what my old driver was ? ing . You don 't have to pay me , I just thought it 's a nice thing to do . All right ... thank you ! Thank you , right ? Thank you ? Yes . I 'll go get my things . Oh , we can stop at an outlet on the way ? Sure . Oh , still free . Then pull the car around . We never were getting along . I think that maybe ? some time sun melt the chill . I always thought Veronica lived here . Me , too . You know , she just finds a comfortable chair and powers down for the night . Come on , we are gonna be late ! You ? share the bathroom mirror . Hey , guys . Thought we may go to McTaggert 's for beers . Now ? tonight , without warning ? You don 't have to get home to your daughter ? Nope . Her mom 's visiting after a year in Botswana , which , by the way , is the year that Botswana won 't never get back . Anyway , they 're hanging in New York for a week , until Stacy finds a country to go fix , so she ? work on herself . So ... I am free . I wish my wife would go to Botswana . The thing is , we kind of have plans . Although , if you want it to ... Oh , I see . You are going some place you do not want me to come . It 's cool . You 'd think it was lame . I promise I wouldn 't . Well , then maybe then ... Phil , can I can talk to you for a minute ? It 's not about you . An occasional drink is fine , but being friends with your boss is a slippery slope . Guys , we can get past the " boss " thing . I consider you friends . So can I talk to you a little further away for a minute ? Still not about you . You think you are their friend , but when push comes to sharp , they are always your boss and they know it . ? but Ted is not like that , he 's a good guy ... Don 't touch that ! Besides , ? us a lot of ? It 's ? . You know , credibility . Now that finally makes sense . Thanks for swinging by my grandmother 's place , and for helping me carry all her possessions . You 're really handling all this pretty well . I can 't believe your grandmother and your driver both died in the same week . What ? Oh , that 's funny . No , they were the same person . You hired your own grandmother to drive you around ? She needed money , but he did 'nt want the handout . She was a very proud woman , and a very proud driver . You maybe wanted to talk about her ? You know , how you 're feeling about losing her . Oh , that 's sweet , but ... No . Are you sure ? I fear that could change our relationship and make it difficult to continue working together . But I suppose is 's the risk I 'm willing to take . Or ... I could just go . Don 't be silly . Let 's talk . Would you like some wine ? I 'd like a whole bunch of wine , yes . Ok , but we 'll have to pour it ourselves , my housekeeper died this week . I 've never been in the ? basement before . They don 't want executives down there , because of all these ? . If you work for a company this intense , you have to find ways to relax . We tried the Veridian chess club and the ? club , but those are ? markets . Besides , nothing releases tension like this . A-ho . Welcome to Medieval Fight Club . Veridian Dynamics . Bosses . Everybody has one . Without bosses we would be like these worms . disgusting . Bosses make everything better . So listen to your boss ... and don 't question them . Otherwise , you 're no better than a worm . Veridian Dynamics . Bosses . Necessary . You have to fight your way up the ladder . The newbies start as peasant farmers . Here are your soiled rags . Sorry , we have stay on character . The King is watching . This is Gill the IT guy ? On the surface world . Here he is our king . Listen , fellows , this all seems really ... Cool ? Sure . Let 's go with " cool " . But I think I 'm ? go . Ted , wait ! You were the first executive that 's ever been down here , You leaving like this makes us look like fools ! And we haven 't been fools for months . Let him go . It 's not your fault . Bosses and employees just shouldn 't hang out , it 's like a ventriloquist trying to be friends with his dummy . At the end of the day you know who is sleeping in a suitcase . The dummy . All right , I was the first who 1st proposed to hang out , so I should endure this . I mean , suffer through ... I mean , support you . Because that 's what friends do . And she married my grandfather at 18 . And my grandfather had an amazing life . He came to this country with nothing but a huge fortune and then Oone day ... tragically ... he got deported . ( drunk voice ) Oh ... That 's so sad . I have a question . We 've been drinking all night . How can you be so sober and me completely fitchased [ drunk ] ? Oh , I 've always been like this . My body just doesn 't process alcohol that way . You want one of these ? You want one of these ? That 's what I thought . Linda . My grandfather ... I never liked him . His smell of onions and once cheated on my grandmother with Eleanor Roosevelt , who ... hated men but loved onions Why you are telling me all this ? Because I 've never told anybody . I 'm the one who turned them in . I had 'em deported . I declare Ted the victor and Victor the loser . God , that was fantastic . Can you fight more than once in one night ? You have done well to bring a warrior of suck pluck into the vault . I told you that 'll work out . ? We ? king 's moped . My ex-wife is spoiling the hell out of our daughter . I can spoil her , too , but one of us has to be a good parent . Really , sweetie ? Ice cream for breakfast . No , you 're right . I don 't let you do that . You know what I do let you do ? Get vaccinated . Ok , I love you too Rose . That bitch is driving me crazy . Oh , easy . Hey , hey , she 's 7 . Not Rose ... my ex-wife . Oh , Stacy . Yes , she was ... Crazy . Crazy hot . Totally agree . You were an animal last night . No-one has ever won four battles in a row . Can admit this medieaval stuff is a ? . And it wasn 't just the winning . It was a constant winning . I can 't wait to get back there tonight . There 's no ? tonight . They give us the basement once a week . I took care of that . I have the AAA ( alcoholics anonymous ) ? mini ? moved to the utility closets , So we can have the basement . The Medieval Fight Club for two nights in a row ? Man , my cog piece ( ? ) just tightened ( ? ) . See ? It 's good to be friends with the boss , ah , fellows ? I hate to break it to you , but we can 't make it tonight . Mom 's birthday . Oh , that 's OK . See you the next time . I can 't miss MFC . That 's how rumours start . Would it be weird to bring my mother ? Yes . Morning , Linda . I couldn 't sleep all night . I really mess things up with Veronica . Last night she opened up and told me something very personal . Now I know too much . What if she has me fired , or deported - I mean , who knows what ? Hello , Linda . I need to see you in my office . Ok , ? heard that , everyone ? Veronica wants to see us all in her office . No , just you . I don 't know why I drink ... I always ( at the end ? ) get laid or fired . I have to start drinking . I like those odds . Linda , there is no easy way to say this . You are firing me . No , that would be easy . You 're fired . What I want to say is , I 've been keeping that secret about my grandfather for years , and it fewlt wonderful to finally get ot off my chest . Oh , really ? I 'm glad to hear that . So , thank you for listening to me . We 're letting you go . What ? That would be another way to say it . Anyway , I slept like a baby all night . Actually , I 'll be afraid that I would tell people your secret . Oh , I haven 't thought of that . I haven 't thought of that at all . But do what you 're going to do , Linda . Oh , I 'm not gonna do that ! We 're friends . Friends don 't do things like that . Friends . I like the way that sounds . Ok , we are friends . Oh , good . Because you never have too many . I used to feed my sister in her sleep , so she wouldn 't be skinnier than me . Wow ... You are my first friend that has ever done something like that . You feel so good to finally admit that to someone . Let 's take the morning off , so we can talk somewhere . I 'll take you to breakfast . Somewhere where the mills ? end of the world slam . I don 't know . I 've got a lot of work to do on the Doppler project . You 're with the boss , relax . Besides , I can give the Doppler project to Joe . Really ? Because I do hate the Doppler project . And I hate Joe . So everybody wins . No-one gets in ! No-one gets in ! Alright , I 'm calling it . Did I win ? Well , he didn 't get in , but ... no . And this defeat brings you all the way down to the court jester . Ted , in order to advance to squire , there is but one knave standing in your way . I propose a mutual surrender . Valiant try , you giant ball of wuss . I declare Ted the victor . Hey guys , no hard feelings , ah ? No , we like that you 're succesfull in everything you do . And you realize , a forfeit takes YOU down to a court jester as well . - Fine , whatever . But it 's going to be the same jokes you heard the last month . Hey ! Your hair look nice . You like it ? Veronica took us out to get our hair done . We 've been spending tons , and tons , and tons of time together this week . Well , at least you to are bonding . We are not bonding , I 'm being absorbed . Well ... whatever it is you 're doing , keep it up , ' cause your hair looks great . You think I care what my hair looks like ? Linda went loudly explaining that the hair isn 't important to her right now . Because being friends with Veronica , hmm , had a price . Sure , they were shopping ... I once slept with my boyfriend 's therapist to find out if he was cheating on me . He wasn 't . And there were massages And I accused Omar Sharif of being a terrorist . So he 'd been kicked off the plane , and I could get his 1st class seat . ... And midnight girl-talk . Hallo ? Hi , it 's me . I 'd ask you over but ... My sister 's in town for my grandmother 's funeral . ... But the friendship came with a price . Veronica keeps dumping all this stuff on me . I 'm like her brain toilet , I don 't know how much more I can take . Just because she 's your boss doesn 't mean you have to prop with her , . Or jump every time she calls you . Phil , Lem ! Is he coming ? Just go , go ! That 's weird , I could have sworn they saw me . Hey , friend ! I was thinking we 'd have lunch today . One o 'clock ? - Excellent . I ... I don 't think that 's such a good idea . Afterwork drinks ? Veronica , I 'm sorry . It ' s just ... I see . You 're dumping me . No , no ! It 's just I 'm really enjoying spending time with you , and don 't deserve this much pleasure . I know , I messed up . I 'm just a big old bucket of crazy . But I thought , again , because of my own inadequacies , we should take a little break . Well , isn 't that funny , because I 've been wanting to take a break , too So , this works up perfectly . Goodbye . You want to take a break from Medieval Fight Club ? But don 't you want to see my new tunic ? It 's got clovers on it . You bought a tunic ? It 's a big investment , considering you stop coming when Rose gets home . That 's right , you stop coming when Rose gets home . No way , I am hooked . I 'll just get a sitter couple of nights a week . But it 's not goint to be the same without my two court jesters . The thing is ... We 've been under a lot of pressure from the model train club to get back ? Also , I have a chance of being the first black mayor of the tiny towns , so ... Well . I guess I can 't force you to keep coming to Fight Club Oh , by the way ... I 'm going to see the specs on taste-altering brain implant on my desk by 9 A.M. No way ! We cannot do it that quickly ! Well , looks like you 're gonna be up all night . Although ... If you had good reasons for not to be working , I suppose it can wait a few days . ? ... Maybe The Fight Club would be good enough for a reason ? That 's what I want to hear . C 'mon , guys , it 's gonna be fun , Be there or be squired ! OoOoOo : ) Be there or be squired ! I said that two years ago . You were right , Lem . His true boss nature came through and attacked . We have to ? a way to drop out of the Fight Club . Yes , but how ? And if we pick ? the Groth ? The Groth ? Well ... I guess it was put on this Earth for a reason . I do not think so , fellows . I 'm done with the Medieval Fight Club . I have a girlfriend now . It 's just one time . Please , Groth ! For us . Meanwhile , it turned out Veronica didn 't like to take a friendship break . Oh , hold it ! And since Veronica was the boss , she had lots of ways to make it clear . Here you go , Joe , enjoy your extra room . Br-r-ing him to me-e-e ! You 're OK , Ted ? You look a little nervous . You can call off now and never come back . No , I just got off the phone with Rose . She 's gonna stay a few more days in New York with her mom , who didn 't clear with me first , so now if I say no , I 'm the bad guy . But .. stuff happens . No ? Who dares challenge ? What the ... Linda , I feel like you 've been wanting to get our relationship back to the way it was . What gave you that idea ? The fact that you turned my cubicle into a hobbit hole ? Let 's not get into the " who 's shrunk whose office " , or " who 's canceled whose dental plan " The point is ... we had something special and you 'd like to get back to that . And I accept . Veronica , I 'd like to be friends , but real friends don 't just talk about their problems all the time . Real friends listen to each other . Okay . I am listening now . Oh .. well , let 's see ... here 's something . When I was growing up , I wanted to be a gimnast , and every night after my parents went to sleep , I used to sneak out of my bed and put on my leotard . And one night , when I thought that my parents were sleeping ... I 'm sorry , I 'm gonna have to stop you . You 're going on and on about yourself ... It feels ... nnn ... needy . Needy ? I told you one thing that happened to me , one thing that 's important in my life ... You 're doing it again . And I find that it off-putting . I 'm sorry , I can 't be friends with you any more . You 've changed . Hey . No , it 's ok , I got it . Oh , sorry . I 'm a little preoccupied . I almost killed a man in the basement . Last week , a story like that would have surprised me . So who 's that you 've alnost killed ? Was it Joe ? I hate that guy , he took off my cubicle . No , I 've been do this Medieval Fight Club , Since Rose had been with her mom , and ... I got carried away . Your ex-wife 's in town ? No , no , she ? in New York for a couple of weeks . And since she 's never around , I had to drop everything so Rose can go be with her . Well , when Rose gets back , she wants to stay up late , and to have ice cream for breakfast , and I don 't let har , because I am an actual parent , not Willy Wonka . So I 'm the bad guy . Rose gets mad at me , and ... I 'm going back to the basement . Why ? There 's your wife down there ? What ? Because it sounds like you 've been fighting ? all week . Either that , ot you 've been turning into a sort of gigantic nerd . First of all , you 're speaking to a knight of ? . So show some respect . Second of all , eh ... you might be right . There 's a single dads ' club that meets on the fifth floor every week . You should check it out . I think I can go beat up some single dads . But I see what you 're saying . You 're smart . In the basement they would drown you as a witch . Actually they 'd just spray you with water ... It 's like a ... Mediaeval Wet T-shirt ? . Good news , Ted . We took a vote , and made you the new king . Then we took another vote , and you 're died . Gloriously in battle . Listen , fellows . I owe you an apology , I 've been working out some personal stuff and I acted like a jerk . I hope I can make it up to you . Just ... rest in peace , King Ted . It means ... you 're dead , so don 't come back . I got it . Just making sure , because ? guy who can miss ? . At least you two got an apology from your boss . All I got from Veronica was a week 's worth of frustration . Translation : n / a Review : MosheDayan : Netzah Yisrael Lo Yeshaker :

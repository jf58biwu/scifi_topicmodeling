 Let me tell you about my day so far . Coffee in Paris . Surf in the Maldives . Took a little nap done on the Kilimanjaro . Oh yeah , and I got pinched for this bullshit in Rio . And then I jumped back for the final quarter of the NBA Finals ' . First class , of course , and all that before lunch . I could go on , but I 'm saying , 'I 'm staying on top of the world ' . It wasn 't always like this . Once I was a normal person . A chump , just like you . You have a lot of cities there . You gotta have a dream , so dream big , right ? See you later . I wanted to give you this , I picked it up in yard sale . I thought you 'd really like it . It 's a little dinged up , missing a few steps . I love it . Really ? - I do . Grow up , riceball . What 's this ? Mark . - Come on , Mark . Mark , give that back to her . - What a nonsense . Look at what David got Millie . - Mark , come on . Stop . You guy like the Eiffel Tower ? If you shake hard enough , you can hear the Eiffel Tower move . I swear to god . He wants to be shaken . - Hey , that 's enough . Stop it . Give it back . - OK Sorry , here . Sorry buddy . I don 't know my own strength . That 's not funny . David ? David , don 't go out there , it 's not safe . David , forget about it . Come on , riceball , don 't be stupid . David , come back . Come on , let it go . It 's OK . Stop , it 's not worth it . Come back , please . Come on , David . Be careful . Come on . - All good , see ? Come back . Millie , don 't out there ! - David ! Someone help me . You can 't help him . - David . Stop , stop stop . And that 's how it happened the first time . One second I 'm a goner , and the next thing I know I 'm at the Ann Arbor Public Library . Home sweet home . Mama left when I was five . As for dad , well ... let 's just say he wasn 't much of one . You 're late , supper 's cold . Where you been anyway ? When I ask a question , I expect an answer , okay ? Hey , hey , hey . What happened to you ? This kid at school . David , get back down here , get a mop and clean this crap up ! David ? David ? Make the right choice ... David ? David , open the door . Did I just teleport ? My own personal library . And that 's when it occurred to me . This thing that just happened to me ... could set me free . If she could run away , so could I. I wanted to tell her everything . - David ? David ? I mean , she wouldn 't believe me anyway . I think it was time to move on . I 'd like a room . You 're not going to be any trouble , are you ? No weird stuff ? Nope . No weird stuff . This is the way I was . I had a million questions . Like , how 's this thing work ? And how I control it . - Mommy , Mommy , you can see the ocean and everything . If we 're lucky , maybe we 'll see King Kong . Really ? You got me ? - I got you , I 'm not letting you go . I was fifteen . I knew of a shortcut . I figured I 'd pay it back someday . Is there a bathroom for customers ? Hey ! It 's this way . - OK . Make it quick . No problem , thanks . I need a bigger bag . Hey ! I said no weird stuff . Let 's go , two days rent you owe me , alright . Hello ! Hello . The police and the FBI have already been through here . Who are you with ? NSA . - They couldn 't make heads or tails of it . The vault has a time-lock , pressure mounts , steel plates . The guy didn 't even open a door . They didn 't know they were robbed until half way through the day . I want the security tapes for the whole month . And I need the names of everyone who has a safety deposit box in that vault . That 's confidential . Why do you need those names ? Whoever robbed your vault has been here before . I want those names , and I want those names ... today . The story had a happy ending . Riceball is dead , but I 've never never been so alive . Now I 'm livin ' in New York . Why should settle in one place , when I can have the whole world . It 's supposed to be a river . But you can see the flooding is worse than ten minutes ago . The question now is , 'What will happen to these people ' ? It would take a miracle to get them . Good afternoon , Mr. Jones . How they doin ' ? - Down by six at the half . Don 't think you need an umbrella . You never know . Watch out . - Can I come sit with you ? Why ? - What are you drinkin ' ? Gin and tonic . Two gin-tonics . You live in London ? Taxi . Dude , this is so cool . I thought the storm was supposed to hit . I heard it went to Fiji . - Fiji , huh ? Yeah , they got about thirty-foot swells . Really ? Why ? - Because you are an abomination . Only God have the power to be all places at all times . One less of you to worry about . Cut him down . - Get the hell out of here . Yeah . We have a lead on the bank , sir . I 'll be on the next flight . Hey , Angelo , how 'd they do ? - Not so good . I told you that you wouldn 't need an umbrella . Yeah , you were right . Long night . Eight years we 've been looking for you . And who are you ? My name 's Roland . What are you doing in my apartment ? - I 'll get to that . What kind of crook leaves a note ? Yeah , I think I need to talk to my lawyers . - Why ? You 're not under arrest . You 're not ... police ? Anybody can rob a bank . What I 'd like to know is how you robbed a bank without opening any of the doors ? Come on , I 'm sure that you can think of something . Look , uh ... if you 're not the police and ... and I 'm not under arrest ... I think I 'd like to leave . Need some help with that ? It 's been a while since you 've used a door , huh ? I know who you are . I know what you are . This conversation is over . This conversation is not over until you answer my question ! Tell me ... how 'd you last this long , huh ? Who 's helpin ' you ? Jumpers . You can hardly jump with 1000 volts of electricity passing through your brain ? Who 's protecting you ? Give me an answer so I can go home . I hate Jumpers . Did you think you could go on with this forever ? You think life faces no consequences ? There are always consequences . Where are you going , huh ? I got you now . Do you think you can hide behind the wall ? Go somewhere , do something ? Not anymore . David ? David ? That you ? David ? Don 't go . Don 't go . Just hear me out , okay ? David ? I don 't know if I 'm goin ' crazy or not ... I don 't know how to think too straight ... but , if you can hear me ... Wait . David . Don 't go . I have to talk to you . David , can you hear me , son ... It 's ok . You can come home ... anytime you want . You 're not crazy . Tele-communications . - This is Roland . He got away . We have his jump sites . I want everybody helping on this . Everybody . Who is this ? May I help you ? - Yes ... Hi , Mrs. Harrison , it 's me , David . David ? David Rice ? Millie was right . You 're not ... - Dead . Yeah . No , I 'm not . Actually , I was hoping that you could tell me where to find Millie . Millie , she 's got her own place over on Wharton , number 260 . She 's still here ? - Yeah , uh-huh . She works at the Little Hands bar , down on the campus . Hey , Riceball ? Mark , Mark Coleman . Sorry , man , I don 't know you . Jesus , am I seeing a ghost ? Some kind of sixth sense ? I don 't know who you 're talking about , okay ? Hey , everyone . It 's Riceball . Come on . You wanna run from your old buddy from high school ? I 'm not , this David . David ? No getting away . Millie ? Hi . You were going to leave without saying anything ? Sorry , I didn 't see you . - No ? That why you 've been staring at me for the past forty-five minutes ? Yeah , David . Why didn 't you say something , huh ? I think you 're drunk . - I 'm not drunk , okay ? I 'm cool . I 'm totally , 110 % cool . And that 's really cool , why don 't you go find a bed and sleep it off , okay ? Why don 't you make a drink , sweetheart ? A splash of that . Come on , come on . Come on . Mark . Stop fighting . Stop . Riceball goes down . Whooo ! What are you doin ' to me ? I guess I don 't know my own strength . Hey , are you okay ? - Yeah . Where 's Mark ? He took off . What ? - I don 't think he 's gonna come back anytime soon . It 's bleeding . It 's nothing . We should take care of that . Come on . So you saw me as soon as I came here ? Maybe . I didn 't know what to say . How about , 'Hi , wow , it 's been a long time ago , how are you ? ' Hello , it 's a long time . How are you ? Good , how are you ? Oh , pretty bored . I didn 't think uh ... you 'd still be here . - Where else would I be ? You had this list , right ? You wanted to travel all over the world ... Things change . We all need to grow up , right ? What do you do ? Banking , you know , banking . Banking ? How 'd you get into that ? It was pretty easy , actually . I sort of landed in there . Didn 't you flunk Algebra ? - No . Fiona , I 'll take my break now . - Yeah , sure . You 're back . Now what do you plan ? Maybe do some traveling . I was uh ... thinking of maybe checkin ' out Rome , actually . You were thinking of checking out Rome ? Come on , you know that was my dream . Don 't try to run me off , okay ? . Why don 't you come with me . - Come with you ? You 're asking me to go to Rome ? I mean only if you want to skip the boring parts . I got it . I 'll take it , thank you much . - As you wish . Can you believe that ten hours ago we were in Ann Arbor ? What does the CIA want with this ? - I 'm afraid that 's classified . Really ? Well , then I 'm afraid that I 'll have to see a federal warrant . 'cause I don 't believe you are who you say you are . Certainly . Great , another cop . Well Mark , tell me what happened at the bank . I told them already . You 're just another suit , you 're never going to believe it . Says here you were beamed into the vault . You want to laugh about it ? Go ahead , have a laugh . You hear me laughing ? The girl 's name is Millie Harrison , and she boarded a plane for Rome sixteen hours ago , and she didn 't go alone . Merci . So ... what do you think ? I think ... there 's something you 're not telling me . What do you mean ? This room ... first class ... Usually in my life when things seem too good to be true , it 's because they are . I told you I 'm in banking . Banking ! See , I know ... that you flunked algebra . David , if you don 't want to tell me everything , that 's okay . Please don 't lie to me . I 'm not lying to you . Okay . I can 't reach it . You know , this was always number one on my list . I know . - You must be really good at this ? Good at what ? Rookie ... you have no idea . Whoa , whoa , wait , wait , wait ... - Sorry folks . Sorry . It 's not possible . It 's closed . - Closed ? How do you mean , it 's closed ? Already closed ? We want to go inside there . - No , it 's impossible . No . - Why is it closed ? It 's impossible . David , it 's okay . I got to see the outside , alright She came all this way to go inside . David , come on . Sorry , he 's ... - See you later . Come on . What ? - Come on . How about a private tour ? It 's closed , we can 't break into the Colosseum . Who said it was closed ? The door was open . Do you want to see the Colosseum or not ? Come on . - Nobody will believe it . This place is incredible . I want you to see this . It 's worth the risk . Yeah . It 's so cool . - Yes , it is . Down here is where they used to keep Gladiators and lions in cages . We should go down there . We can 't go down there it 's prohibited ... - Nothing is prohibited . What ? Millie . That door was open too ? - It 's open now . You 'll want to see this , trust me . There 's more stuff ? - Maybe ... I think it 's telling you to not enter . You speak Italian ? No . Well , ' ingresso " ... Uh-huh . is ' come on in - Oh , I thought it meant ' Bullshit ' . Well , that is the cue you stay here while I go around and open it from the other side . It 's alright , you 'll catch up . Thank you very much . The next show will be at six o 'clock . Don 't forget to tip your host . It 's in there . Yes , I can see it , never mind . I wouldn 't open that door if I were you , not if I wanted my girlfriend to keep breathing I wouldn 't . But that 's just me . What are you going to do anyway , bring her down , have a nice little romantic picnic ? Nice little tea party . So many things can happen . You much as look at her I 'll ... - Wait a minute , wait a minute . Are you going to jump me away ? Did you think you were the only one ? You really have no idea , do you ? You lead the life you live , you think you can just go on a Roman holiday , and they wouldn 't know it ? Just jump all over the place , jump , jump , jump , jump , and nothing 's gonna happen ? But they 'll know it . Or me . I mean , I already know you know me , so don 't talk about me , but them . There . Hello , boys . Just me . That 's new . Welcome to the war . Let me know if you guys are gettin ' tired . Close . David ? What 's going on ? Hey , which way 's the girlfriend going ? Who are these people ? - Paladins . Paladins kill jumpers , I kill Paladins . Case dismissed . Police . Wait . I just came through your jump slot . What do you think you are doing here ? Huh ? You probably want to jump right back . You 're not supposed to see all this stuff , you 're not supposed to be here , get out . So would you kindly fuck off ! I said now . Maybe your girlfriend is still alive . What happened to you ? Uh , nothing . Let 's go , come on . What ? - Come on , let 's just get out of here . That didn 't sound like nothing . - You were right , okay ? I shouldn 't have gone down there . - David ? Everything 's fine . Come on , we can still get to the museum . David ? Will you talk to me ? David ? - There must be a cop around here somewhere . Why aren 't you talking to me ? Would you please talk to me ? I 'll tell you all at the hotel , okay ? I don 't want to wait until the hotel . Millie , it 's all part of a ... - No , that 's not it . We 've got to go back . Police . Um , no comprendo . - You were at the Colosseum ? Uh , I think you 've make a mistake . I know ... We wanted ... I 'm sorry ... Could you send us not with a warning to leave ? OK ... Ok ... Millie , go back to the hotel , okay ? No ... No , we 're not together . - Please listen to me . I know its not . Millie , go back to the hotel . No . I told you , I want to see Millie . - Where is the body ? I didn 't do anything , okay ? I don 't know how many times you want me to tell you the same thing . Do you know how much longer he 's going to be back there ? We 're waiting for a Magistrar . Yeah I know , we 've been waiting for a Magistrar all night . I don 't speak not your ... I don 't know what you 're saying . Now please sit or we sit you . Okay . - Sit ! She 's got nothing to do with this . - Pero ? ( speaks Italian ) The Magistrar is here . We will hold onto your passport . Don 't worry . You won 't need it where you 're going . Hello , David . You 've only got about thirty seconds before they come through that door . You understand me ? Let 's get out of here . Take the girl if she stays here , she 's dead . Mom ... Mom ! Twenty seconds , David . Mom ! Mom ! Ready . They released me . They just let you go ? - They just let me go . Just like that ? - Just like that . If they let you go , why are you running ? It 's a good idea that we leave now . - Wait , what did they say to you ? Asked me some questions . - For eight hours ? They had a lot of questions . I really want to trust you , but you 're making it extremely hard . So trust me , let 's go . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hey ! Can you take us ? Yes . Step into the taxi , Millie . Millie , get in the car . Please , get in the taxi . It 's yours . Do you remember I told you that you didn 't have to tell me everything ? I changed my mind . What 's in the backpack ? Where did you get that ? I will not lie to you . But you don 't want to tell the truth either . I can 't get on this flight with you , Millie . This is far as we go together . You are going to Detroit ? Uh-hum . Roland . We lost him , sir . How many did you send ? - Two men . I told you , send everybody . She said that two would be enough , but we missed him . It 's like he knew we were coming . We 're searching for him now . Keep me informed . I 'm taking a different tact . William Rice ? Yeah . - IRS . Could we , uh , go inside and talk ? I don 't have to ask , it 's a courtesy . So , what 's this all about ? - Your son , David . Why , is he in some sort of trouble or something ? This would go a lot swifter if you let me ask the questions . When was the last time you saw your son ? Eight years ago . Eight years ? - That 's right . What about friends ? Anybody I can talk to ? - He didn 't have a whole lot of friends . I would like to talk with David 's mother . Well , me too . Her Barbie toys are all over . Is that her ? Mary Rice . At least that was her name back then . When was the last time you saw her ? She split when the kid turned five . I haven 't heard a word since . If I hear anything , I 'll be sure to give you a holler . No , you won 't . - No , I won 't . First thing we need to get on this Nintendo is its new controls . Look , you see that ? Still alive , eh ? There 's more of them ? - Hundreds more , I 'm tracking ten right now . What do you care ? There 's lots more . What about the rest ? What about the rest ? Like I said , I hunt them . Who are these guys ? - I told you , ' The Paladins ' . Yeah , you 've told me their names . But you didn 't tell me what they want . It 's pretty simple , they want us dead . You didn 't figure that out ? Yes , I got much . What do you want ? I was thinkin ' we do whatever the hell we want . Now , can you please ... I 'm hit . He 's dead . Thanks . You really don 't get it , do you ? Paladins have been killing jumpers for years . Way back since Medieval Times . They 're fanatics . Religious nut jobs , Inquisition , witch hunts , that was them . Look , they 're smart . They 're fast , they 're organized , no matter what , they 'll kill anybody that gets in their way .

Just answer the question ... or I 'll drop you off the top of Mount Everest , okay ? What ? - What have you told him ? I have no ... What ? What ? I know you told him about home , I know you told him about Ann Arbor , Did you tell him about Millie . - I told him everything . Why ? Why did you do that ? - Why not ? Who are you ? Where did the Paladin go ? - Swimming . Pacific ? - No , actually Atlantic . Nice little shark pit in Cuba . What 'd you think you 're doing ? Put that stuff back ! - Actually , I need to borrow a few things . Stay away from that wall ! Keep your eyes out ! I need to find Roland . - No , it should not . No , you don 't . All we got is eight hours . - Eight hours ? Her plane lands in eight hours . - That stuff 's not gonna help , it 's like four years old . You wanna jump back to your high school , so you can learn something ? I 've been tracking you for ten years . Look at this . Do you see this ? Our first run in Nepal You should see what he gave me back in Prague . They 're dead . Forget Roland . Don 't waste your time . Just leave it to me . Do you mind ? - Look ... Can I have a little privacy here ? You know , this is kinda like ... Just ... Just ... You know ... turn around . I was thinking that if we do this together ... We could get him . - You mean , like you and me ? Yes . - Like we 'd team up ? Yeah . I 'm sorry , but I don 't play well with others . Do me a favor , will ya ? Don 't be here when I get back . Find a rock , crawl under it and stay there . Choi Woh , brother . That 's " goodbye " in Chinese . You fuckin ' followin ' me ? I 'm the only person who can . - Lucky me . Why you walkin ' ?

Two superheroes , join forces , like a limited run ... I see what you 're trying to do . I 'm not buying it . For your sake , go home . You live in a cave . - It 's called a lab . And what 's the point ? I 'm just saying , we have this common thing . And I know where to find Roland . We doin ' this or what ? Sorry , foot stuck . Going solo . - I 'm not getting rid of you , am I ? You might want to hold on tight . That was close . Not bad . This thing must weigh two tons easy . How do you ... ? - If it moves , I can jump in it . Actually , I knew this jumper once , crazy bastard , Tried to jump a whole building . Won 't be tryin ' that again . Why 's that ? Cause he 's dead . Killed him . He got it to shake a little though . How long you been doing this for ? - Doing what ? Driving ? No , jumping . Since I was five . Since you were five ? - Yeah .

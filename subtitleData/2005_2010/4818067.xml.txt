We can 't be concerned about appearances ? you three . What is it ? We have something to discuss . Oh ? What ? We think it 's time we were told . What is the true purpose of this tournament ? You asked Jan ? so we all decided that asking the Chairman directly would be faster . Violette ? Yes . What good will knowing do you ? Ummm ... Simple pride or stubborness isn 't enough to win against Basquash or King of Kings ! Oh ? we don 't want to throw this fight ! Citron ! That 's an insult to the Chairman ! I understand . And I agree . You three may have a right to know . It 's gotten larger again ... both larger . Destroy ! Destroy ! Destroy ! Not going to accept kindness from an enemy ? I have no problem with it . I still remember when you changed . Your play 's been different ever since you met that man . I became arrogant . Thinking of myself as someone chosen ... And then I lost everything . I cursed people . Falcon . we 'll meet in the final match . Don 't break before then . I 'm back ! What are you doing ? welcome back ! We were just running a simulation of the matches .

 Have you heard anything about Jackson Holden ? We launched from his trawler . I haven 't heard about him . Okay , well , maybe we could check the Coast Guard and see if there have been any emergency ... Right now , you need to worry about yourself . Look ... if I hear anything , I 'll let you know , okay ? Try to sleep . Excuse me . Excuse me . Okay . I almost punched you in the face . We gotta get out of here , Rich . No , it 's okay . Let 's go , come on . There 's no way we 're gonna get out of here . Okay . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Look at this . How ' bout these , huh ? Yeah , right ? Hey , what are you doing ? I 'm just calling Jesse to let him know I 'm okay . What ? No ! Don 't do that , Laura . Why ? Just quickly . I just need to hear his voice . Laura , what makes you think that if they followed us to this little town in Oregon that they ain 't staking ' out Sean 's house or my sister-in-law 's already ? I need to hear his voice really quickly . Laura , I understand that , but they 're already tapping the phones . Come on , now , that 's the easiest and first thing that they do , okay ? If you call him now , you 're gonna be putting him in more danger than he already is . But I mean , Rich , Jesus , I mean , don 't you need to hear your kid 's voice ? Yes , of course I do ! But that 's not an option ! It 's not an option . Okay ? Now we gotta finish putting on these clothes , see if that ATM card works , and just let 's concentrate on the things that we do have control over , all right ? Like getting that tape in the right hands , right ? Yes . Okay , then , come on . Hello ? Hi , Sean , it 's Laura . Laura , are you okay ? I called the Coast Guard , and I didn 't ... I know , I know . I 'm ... I 'm okay . I don 't Rich to know I 'm making this call . There are people looking for you . They could be listening . What people ? Wh-wh ... they were there ? Yes . Uh ... what about Jesse ? Is he okay ? He 's fine . Sean , I 'm gonna come there . No , don 't . I don 't care . I 'm gonna come there . I think it 's safer for us if you don 't come . Okay . All right , Sean , well , please give him a ... a big kiss for me , please . I will , and take care . Be safe . All right , I got 300 bucks . All right , come on . Let 's go . You should know your son has done something quite extraordinary . Well , thank you . It 's been very interesting around our house lately . Well , it truly is an amazing animal . I may be getting ahead of myself , but this could be bigger than the coelacanth . The coelacanth ? Well , let 's just say it 's a bit like finding a unicorn . Oh . Except ... Nim 's real . Well , he certainly is . This is David Howell from the North Carolina Oceanographic University . And this is Dr. Hammaker from the Smithsonian in Washington . How does it feel to make natural history ? Pretty good , I guess . This week 's Copy City special is two-for-one on all laser print orders . That 's right , two for one on all color ... Hey there . Hi . You guys need some assistance ? Yeah , actually , we do . We 're looking to do a couple things . We want to upload the footage on this tape , and then make a couple of DVD copies of it . Keith 's better with the computers . Keith . We 'll download the tape into the hard drive . Okay . Then upload and burn from there . Cool , cool . Just need a firewire . See ? Goes up in there . Great . What 's that ? Why is it doing that ? Hmm . Let 's see . Looks like the tape got wet . No , no , no . That shouldn 't be a problem . It should be fine . Yeah . Man , what are you doing ? The reels on the tape are sticking . I 'm just gonna tighten them up . Okay , sorry . Just ... We traveled a long way to get that footage . I understand . Okay . Okay . Oh , come on , man . This can 't be happening now . There it is . You guys shot this ? Yeah . What we need to do is get it on the web and we need as many people to see it as possible . What are our options for that ? You mean like viral video ? Yeah , yeah , exactly . Strange-Film . That 's the joint . I mean , people post videos like that George Bush cartoon , cats with two tongues , stuff like that . People can get it , they can copy it , and they can send it out to all their friends ? Yeah , maximum eyeballs . I mean , how do you think the Paris Hilton tape happened ? Um ... Hey , what is that ? Where did you find the egg ? Out in the harbor , by Figure Eight . There was a whole bunch of them . So you took it home . And put it in our fish tank . We have some of the eggs here , but they 're not fertilized . But a lot of eggs have hatched . Whole swarms of them . He thinks that may be what 's responsible for the killing out at Southport . And I got attacked by a swarm of them , out at the electric cable . But Nim would never do that . Nim ? Nimrod . That 's his name . How 'd you come up with that ? Actually , my friend Phil did . We totally trained him . He 's smarter than a dog . What 's this about the electrical ? I ... He just likes it . And salt . He loves salt . And he obviously has some really advanced healing capabilities . Yeah . Yeah . So it 's kind of better if we go in one or two at a time . I think , uh , a lot of people would spook him . Whatever you say , Miles . This is your show . David , why don 't you go in and ... one more ? Uh , Mom ? Okay . So just ... keep quiet and , uh , no sudden movements around the tank , and he 'll stay calm . Just grab a fish . Whoa . Yeah . Whew , you kept this thing in your house ? They skipped , boss . They were gone when we got there . She 'll try to make contact with her son . She already did . We got something on the tap on the ex-husband . Well , let me hear it . Hello ? Hi , Sean , it 's Laura . Laura , are you okay ? I called the Coast Guard , and I didn 't ... I know , I know . I 'm ... I 'm okay . I don 't want Rich to know ... They called from a pay phone ? Cell . Probably stolen . Get people in the area . They can 't be too far from the hospital . Here 's 15 extra DVDs for you , and you 'll go for Strange-Film . Okay , and so it 's online right now ? Yeah , yeah . Oh , and I chain-mailed the entire OSU history department with the link , Really ? So you 're good . That 's awesome . Hey , man , you 're good . Huh ? Appreciate it . Sleestak underground , baby . Thanks , thank you . Peace out . Y 'all be good . Laura . Oh , my God . I 'm starving . Oh , this is so good . Mmm , unbelievable . Mmm . Yes , may I please have the number in San Jose , California ... Channel 6 , KSOJ . Mmm , can you help me remember this ? 555-0186 . Mmm-mmm . Who is that , your reporter friend ? Now all we 've got to do is get to San Francisco . Hey . Hey ! Ah , you ... They didn 't take it . I mean , what is ... Nobody stops for hitchhikers anymore . They all seen too many crazy movies and read too many stories about all the weirdoes out there . You know what I think ? Huh ? Honestly ? You wanna get old school on ' em . I mean , I think . Let 's get old school on ' em . Come on . All right , here we go . Hi ... hi , hi , hi , hi . Rich ! Hi ! San Francisco ? All set with sensors ? Should be reading his field ... now . There you go . He 's putting out about 15 volts . Let 's put in the mullet . That 's odd . Why isn 't he going after them ? Maybe he 's not hungry . Well , that isn 't it . We 've been withholding food . Why would you do that ? We 're trying to prompt his hunting behavior , and measure the electrical charge . Well , you don 't need to starve him . He 'll zap the fish on his own . Miles , I appreciate you being here , but I want you to stand over there , please . What was that ? Pretty sure he sneezed . Yeah , I don 't think he likes this . Miles , get back , you 're distracting him . Go . Thank you , have a good day . You too . Bless you . Uh , thanks . You 're the guy that goes to Del Mar Academy , right ? Uh , yeah ... I guess . You got arrested or something , right ? I go to Eisenhower . I heard about that . It 's ... pretty crazy . Well , it wasn 't that crazy . I mean , well , we did steal that car , I guess . Stole a car ? I 'm Caitlin , by the way . Miles . So , why aren 't you down in the critter lab with all the big brains ? Oh , you know , I just , uh , taking a break . Lot of research to do . Kicked you out , huh ? Yeah , kinda . It 's not like they 're gonna let you stand in the way of their big discovery or anything . I mean , he was my discovery . It 's all about revisionist history , dude . No , no , no , no . Dr. Blum and I have a deal . Maybe you don 't know Dr. Blum as well as you think you do . That 's good ! Hello ? Hi , Laura . It 's Ann Tracy . Hey , Ann , hi , how ... Yeah , thank you so much for calling me back . How are you ? Good , got married . Really ? Congratulations . That 's ... that 's great . Last month . Oh , that 's really wonderful , Ann . Uh , listen , Ann , I ... I have a question for you . I have this tape that I think is potentially newsworthy . And , um , I would really like to bring it by your office and show it to you . Okay , sure . Great ! Do you still remember how to get here ? Yes , yes , I do . See you soon . We on ? Yes . All right . We were rescued from the coast guard , like , you know , two days ago . And so here we are , I mean , basically . Wow , that 's a pretty crazy story . Yeah , it 's actually a true story too . Oh , thank you . And this other guy , Jackson ? Jackson , yes . He just vanished ? Not quite sure what happened . Right , but maybe you could , you know , get to the coast guard and , like , talk to them , poke around , find out what happened to him . Well , yeah , but let 's take a look at your footage first . Sure , sure . Absolutely . Okay , so I just have to sort of fast forward some of this . 'Cause I 've documented the entire experience . So just bear with me . Where are they ? There . There . So tell me , what am I looking at ? It 's pretty impressive , isn 't it ? It 's , um , it 's a new marine vertebrate . New species at the bottom of the ocean . A carnivore . So it eats ... Everything . What is this ? What am I looking at ? I don 't get it . It 's a new species , Bret . Why is that news ? Uh , does it eat people ? Um , yes , yes , actually ... Eating people is good . We can use that , right ? The real thing is that it 's an ecological threat . So 's hairspray , but hairspray doesn 't eat people . It 's different than hairspray . You 're saying you were down how deep ? 5,000 feet , actually . It killed his brother , Bret . What ? - That thing ? - Not that one . It ate your brother ? Why didn 't you tell me that ? You built your own submarine . That 's actually a bathysphere , which is a slightly different structure . So this is my copy ? Yes , you keep that . And we know how to get in touch with you ? Yes , absolutely . Have a good day . So we 'll let you know . Um , where are you gonna be ? We 'll be at the Fairchild . But nobody can know that , ' cause ... Mum 's the word . Right , but seriously , Ann . Seriously , nobody can know that . It doesn 't leave this room . Thank you , thank you very much for your time . Just think about ... Right , yeah . So what do you think ? American Nessie . Oh , come on , the story 's too good to check . Look , I 'm asking Bill . He 's a science reporter , okay ? Oh , yeah , I can use this . Yeah . Is he okay ? The gland is here on the anterior edge of the scapula . He 's fine , Miles . But he 's not moving . We had to sedate him . It 's safer that way . Hold him still . Tell me what you 're doing ! We 're just exploring his healing properties , that 's all . Dr. Blum ... Come on , now , you shouldn 't be in here right now . It 's just a needle biopsy . He 'll be fine . I should be in there with him . No , Nim gets too riled up when you 're around . That 's ' cause he knows me . That 's right . You 've bonded , you raised him . It 's what we call imprinting . And that 's a bad thing ? I just think it would be best if you kept out of the lab . At least while we 're doing research . You 're always doing research ! This is an important discovery . It 's not time to be selfish . Taking another break ? Yeah . Guess you were right . Congratulations . Wanna see something cool ? What are you doing ? You 're into critters and all that . You 'll like this . Nice , huh ? A jelly did that . No way . Mmm-hmm . North shore last summer . Man-o ' - War rolled up on me in-between sets . Touch it . It 's all smooth . I got a scar . Not from a jellyfish , but ... What is that , a bite ? Yeah . Dog ? Yeah , dog . Cool . Well , since I 'm off work , I think I 'm gonna hit the water . Swells picked up . Why don 't you come ? Um , I don 't surf . I could teach you . I 've taught lots of guys . Wow ... so you 're turning me down . I guess so . No worries . See you around . Oh , here she is . Hey , guys . Hey , Ann . Hi . Guess what ? What ? They 're running with the piece . Yes . Hey , they think this thing is really fun . Fun ? No , it 's not . It 's not a cute piece . I mean , it 's not a cat in the tree kinda thing . So what are you saying ? Are you not interested ? Of course we 're interested , Ann . I 'm saying it 's not a funny ... Perfect . I 'm gonna get a crew here in about an hour . Wha ... okay . So right away ? Yeah , we 'll put you in the ballroom , it 'll be great . And we 'll have your video streaming online . Oh , we actually got it streaming on a website already . You wanted eyes on this . Yeah . You 're gonna get it . Great . Hey , we could really use a laptop . You think you could get your hands on one ? I might need some clothes to change into . No problem . Anything you need . There 's just one more thing . I was just off the phone with the coast guard . They found your friend 's boat . Really ? Where ? Off the coast of Long Beach . They emailed these photos . Long Beach , that 's ... 1,000 miles away . That 's California , isn 't it ? They said it looks like there was a struggle . Yeah , I mean , these are shell casings here . Is he , um ... They don 't know . Uh , sorry , you mean they don 't know ... Where is he ? He wasn 't on board . All they found was a boat . Phil . Genius . Phil ? Who 's Phil ? Wh-what are you doing here ? I have a surprise for you . Come on . I ... I can 't go anywhere . I 'm grounded for , like , another six months . If my folks come home and I 'm not here ... Come on . Back in the day , you stole a car , remember ? Go get your stuff . Go on . All right . How 'd you know where I live , anyways ? I snaked your work file . Well , you 're like a total criminal , huh ? You 're the one that 's on work release . No ... oh , community service . Hey , check what else I snaked . I thought maybe we could go see your lizard after hours , no pencilnecks . Cool . You can hold on tighter . Hey , honey , listen , I was thinking : science chic , or business casual ? Uh , yeah , that one 's nice . I like that . You know what ? You 're right . This color isn 't right for you anyway . Okay . You know what ? Um ... I forgot your name , but we 're gonna need a couple chairs here . See , Laura , you know , Dr. Daughtery , she should be sitting over here facing me . Un , no , no actually . We 're ... I think ... I think one 's good . Thank you . What ? Come here . We gotta get another chair . What do you mean ? Um , I just , um ... Rich . Yeah ? Even after all that we 've been through together , we still have two very different takes on this thing . And , um , I don 't wanna confuse people . Confuse people ? What 's that supposed to mean ? It 's television , you know ? And , um , I guess there 's an image and a credibility to project ... that ... is ... I see . So what are you saying , that , uh ... I 'm gonna get up there and make us look crazy ? Rich , don 't get mad . I 'm only trying ... I 'm not mad . Who 's mad ? I 'm not mad . We were down there in that thing , and I told you we were gonna be all right . It was all part of the plan , didn 't I ? Yeah . And it was . And we made it out . Okay . Just fine . I know . That 's true . That is ... The only reason we got those tapes is because of what I did . And I know that 's true . Okay , then what 're you doing ? What are you talking about ? Rich , we have a videotape of a sea monster . It 's really not the most believable thing to begin with . And I think that to put a scientist out there , it gives it a more credible face . All right . All right , I 'm here . And I 'm ready . Folks , let 's clear it out , okay ? Where is Dr. Daughtery ? Go on , go get ' em , doc . Um ... Okay , this is it . This is our big piece . To the top of the countdown now , and we conclude with an amazing rescue at sea . I know , I know , amazing rescues at sea are a dime a dozen . How about saving two people bailing out from what amounts to a backyard submarine ? And then it gets interesting . The wild tale of what lies beneath from our correspondent Bill Withrow in San Francisco . Sea monsters have been a part of our storytelling tradition since man first set sail on the open seas . They are the stuff of legends . Tall tales , myth . Or are they ? Humans have explored less than 10 % of our oceans . There 's an entire world deep beneath the sea . A world far larger than our own . Could this world be inhabited by giant unseen predators ? One woman from Sausalito , California believes such creatures are in existence . And she says she has the evidence to prove it . That looks natural . Yeah , I , um , had to ... I had to do it , like , three times , 'cause I kept looking at the camera . It 's okay . Three days ago , Dr. Daughtery and a friend were pulled from the icy waters of the North Pacific after a harrowing deep water dive . A dive where she claims to have captured video footage of something in the deep . Something that threatens our very existence . Quite an adventure , huh ? Yeah . How did you get that video footage ? Uh , Two colleagues and I built a bathysphere out of salvage material . Now bathysphere is a small submersible with no propulsion . That 's right . That 's right . It 's tethered to a steel cable and then simply lowered down . And in your case , about a mile ? Almost a mile . That 's right . We sailed out to where we presumed the animals were gathering . And we went down there and made a videotape . It sounds so simple , and yet you almost died in the process . Yeah , uh , shortly after we had an encounter with a pod of the creatures . Uh , our cable snapped . And , um , we were stranded on the sea floor . Yeah , you look good . Thanks . I really didn 't think that we would make it out alive . Yeah ? But she did make it back . Back from a watery grave with video footage of a new , amazing species in what she describes as a mating ritual . Now what you are about to see has not been edited in any way . Is it a sea monster ? Judge for yourself . This is doctor Laura Daughtery and Rich Connelly 4,000 feet below the surface , amidst a pod of the new vertebrates . Their lengths range from 100 feet to 175 . This tape has been examined by our video experts . They say it 's unaltered . The genuine article . And furthermore , they say these things are real . Absolutely . There you go , that 's what I 'm talking about . That 's what I 'm saying . Genuine article , huh ? What are they ? Where are they from ? I ... I can 't actually speak of its origin , But I can tell you that it is a new species . It is a new marine vertebrate . And 175 feet ? The ones that I observed , yes . Here 's a question , do you think it could be a leftover dinosaur ? Partly . Explain that . I was able to obtain tissue samples . And we compared its DNA to various other fossil records . And we found that it is very similar to something called a Liopleuridon . An extinct animal . Presumed extinct . Yes . We found them . A hotel near Nob Hill . Want us to bring ' em in ? We brought Dr. Daughtery 's video to Robert Vanderwal ... We 're past that . Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association , to see what he had to say . Very intriguing . Oh , man , this doesn 't look good . I 've met Vanderwal before . He 's an excellent scientist . You 're not buying it ? I think the idea of a Leviathan , the Kraken , is very powerful in the human psyche . It 's an exciting idea . It sells . We like a good monster story . Exactly . But that 's all it is , a story . This guy 's a jerk . If there were huge sea monsters running around out there , don 't you think we 'd have seen some kind of evidence by now ? I address this . I address this . Evidence Dr. Daughtery says she 's seen first hand . These creatures will have a profound impact on food supplies , shipping , natural resources . Uh , international relations . Within six months , we will be on the brink of an ecological and an eventual humanitarian disaster . What do you say to that ? I say consider the source . What is that supposed to mean ? By that he means Dr. Daughtery 's standing in the academic community . Her PhD in marine biology from the University of Hawaii was rescinded after charges she plagiarized her thesis . Charges she denies . I have the proof . They have to discredit me somehow . By planting this material in your thesis ? That 's part of the cover-up . That might make you appear as a conspiracy nut . I realize that it might be difficult for people to trust me . But , uh , trust your eyes . My eyes see an unemployed woman with flash animation software . Trust your eyes , Keith . Either way , I 'm canceling my trip to Belize . Hate to be eaten on my birthday . Just don 't go swimming below 5,000 feet , and you 'll be fine , Bill . Be with us tomorrow night , when our special live guests will probably be the Jersey Devil . Good night , and good luck . Are you sure this is okay ? I thought you liked to live dangerously . Yeah , just ... Not when I 'm on probation . It 'll be okay . Here ... hold this while I change . A little bit higher . No peeking . I ... I 'm not . Aren 't you supposed to be ? My hands are so totally pruned . Let me see yours . Yours aren 't wrinkled at all . Weird . Dr. Blum ... Dad , I can explain . " Dad " ? Caitlin , not one more word . Get him out of there . Nim , get over here . Miles , I thought you were smarter than this . You wouldn 't let me see him . So you broke in , Endangered his safety , your safety . Potentially contaminated the habitat . You know what it costs to drain and clean this tank ? I 'm sorry , Miles . I think it 'd be best for everyone if you stopped coming to the aquarium . Yeah , it 's a real good thing we decided to play that science angle , 'cause , boy , you get my face on camera and , just , the credibility goes right out the window . You know what , Rich , man ? I didn 't know they were gonna make it , like , an info-tainment piece . How am I supposed to ... I don 't know , but it was like shark week . Oh , man . Nobody 's gonna take it seriously now . Hey . What ? Look at this . Look . I mean , what ... You see that counter ? Oh , my God . I mean ... you kiddin ' ? And look ... they got forms and everything . Huh ? It 's gettin ' out there . It 's gettin out there . Come on , get on . I 'll take you home . No thanks . Look , I 'm sorry , all right ? It 's not like I knew he was gonna be there . It 's not your fault . When he cools off , I 'll talk to him about your pet . This is what no one gets . He 's not my pet . Okay , he 's the missing link or whatever . Forget it . You sure you don 't want a ride ? It 's not that far . I can walk . Okay . Maybe I 'll see you tomorrow . I don 't know . I can 't go back . Who is it ? Front desk . I have a fax here for you . Uh ... Rich , are you expecting a fax or something ? Huh ? What ? I said are you expecting a fax ? No , not me .

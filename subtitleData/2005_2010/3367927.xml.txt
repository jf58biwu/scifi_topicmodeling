 Torchwood Outside the Government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes ... and Torchwood is ready . Ladies and gentlemen , girls and boys , have we got a show for you tonight ! A once in a lifetime show . Amaze your ears , astonish your eyes , then run along home and tell your friends and neighbours . A once in a lifetime show , never to be forgotten for the rest of your lives . So , why not step inside ? We 're waiting for you . Great ! What is that ? I don 't know where you came from , mate , but I know where you 're going . Tosh ? I heard this sound . An old sound , like a pipe organ . A what ? Did you hear anything ? No . Is there a circus in town , or a travelling fair , something like that ? On a night like this ? They 'd be wasting their time . Where 's Ianto ? He 'd know . He 's gone to the cinema with Gwen and Owen , some kind of opening night he wanted to check out . The building 's got a record of rift activity but it 's been quiet for years so ... A nice trip to the cinema , you said . Yeah , that 's right . Ianto , nothing down here , mate . - Oh , come on , Owen . - It 's more than just a cinema . - It 's the Electro ! - Oh , wow ! Excuse me . Thank you . Where 's that stupid bloody son of ours ? - He said he 'd be here on time . - He 'd better be . He 's got the film . And what good is a cinema without a film ? Good evening , gentlemen . Evening , madam . Welcome to the Electro . I love this place . Used to come here with my dad . They 'd show kids ' films on Saturday morning . So where 's the popcorn and the ice cream ? I think you 've missed out . - It 's educational . - Okay . Come on . - What time do you call this ? - Sorry , dad . People are waiting . You won 't believe this , but when I was splicing the film- - Look , just get up to that projection room , will you ? Now ! As proud owners of the Electro museum , it is our privilege to be able to show you how the cinema and Hope Street looked in days gone by . If you watch carefully , who knows ? You may even see long-dead members of your family waiting in the cinema queue . Bernard ! Do you recognise any of your long-lost relatives , Gwen ? There 's Aunty Peggy . She 's been on the gin , again . Can you be quiet ? He 's showing the wrong bloody film ! Where 's Hope Street gone ? Oh , shit ! Where the hell did that film come from ? I 've no idea . I swear I didn 't edit those clips . - Don 't be so stupid ! - It 's true ! Look , just bloody well change it , will you ? ! - I can 't , the machine won 't switch off ! - Oh , get out of the way . This is crazy ! It 's the same pictures over and over again . Yeah . Right . Come on , let 's go . Wait ! - I just saw Jack . - Where ? In the film . - What are you talking about ? - What ? I swear I saw him . - Ianto .. ? - Wait . Just wait . Come on . - Let 's go . - Yes , come on . Are you coming ? When the film stopped , these shadows went past me . What kind of shadows ? I don 't know . It wasn 't clear . There was something else . You were up there on the screen . As large as life . What was I doing ? You were on some sort of stage . Outside a big tent . You seemed to be part of a travelling show . I heard it . Heard its music . Just a snatch of it . That film was beautiful . All those acts performing for us . Part of history , trapped on film forever . Their days were numbered . Cinema may have saved their images , but it finished off the travelling shows . Killed them . I 'm at the bus stop , mum . By Hope Street . No . Gemma 's brother couldn 't bring me home . His car don 't work . Well , what about dad ? Can 't you wake him ? Mum ? Would you like a ticket for the travelling show , my dear ? - No , thanks . - Every young person 's dream . Perhaps she 'd like to join the show instead . Why not ? You could travel with us . - Forever . - Look , just go away , will you ? Did you hear what I said ? So you say the projector went haywire ? Yeah , even with the mains switched off it still kept running . Playing those film clips . It 's like it had a mind of its own . - Working now . - I know . So where did you get these ? From the basement here . There were stacks of cans . See , I 've been compiling old footage of Hope Street and the Electro for the opening night . But the circus clips weren 't on it . I swear . So the film that was shown wasn 't meant to be here ? No , and that 's what 's so scary . I mean , it kind of played itself . It 's like it wanted to be seen . Like something was trying to get through ? Yeah . And there was a sound , like old fashioned music . Played on an organ or something . And there was a face looking out at me . And there was a smell , like ... like bromine . Or iodine . - Like film itself . - That 's right . - And this is the film ? - Yeah . Jack , the systems here are behaving very oddly . And I heard the sound you mentioned . That fairground sound . Can you trace the source ? No . But there was a peak in rift activity at the Electro . Then nothing . Plus I 'm recording unusual rift traces nearby . - Where ? - Chain Lane . Runs parallel to Hope Street . Sending the co-ordinates now . Tosh , we 're on our way . Tell the police we 're dealing with it . Epileptic maybe ? Could be wearing a tag . - She isn 't . - She got ID ? - I 'll check . - What 's wrong ? She 's got a heartbeat , but she isn 't breathing . Shouldn 't really be alive . And look at her mouth . She 's got no saliva . Look , her lips are cracked . Dry as a bone . We need to get her to a hospital . Sorry . We 're closed . Do you hear me ? We 're closed . - Make her cry . - You what ? I want to drink her tears . The name 's Nettie Williams . Her parents are outside . Apparently she was visiting a friend . - Have any witnesses come forward ? - No . Has anyone been able to communicate with her ? No . No change in her condition . - Motor response ? - Non-existent , and they 're treating it as a coma . - And they 're wrong ? - Totally . There 's no signs of cerebral dysfunctions , no symptoms of hypoxia . And her body 's dehydrated . You know when a spider sucks the liquid out of its victims ? Well , this is a bit like that , except they 've left her partly alive . She couldn 't cry about it even if she wanted to , the poor kid . She 's got no tears . There 's been another one . - Who 's she ? - We don 't know . The paramedics found her . It freaked them . She was lying in an open doorway . Looking like this . - Where was this ? - The corner of Hope Street . The same . Heartbeat but no breath . Her mouth 's been drained of moisture . This makes no sense , they 're almost dehydrated and possibly brain dead yet somehow they 're still with us . So , some part of them has been taken elsewhere ? Well , that 's impossible . For the body to be alive there must be a life force somewhere . - Yet they 've separated it , stolen it . - Who has the power to do that ? I don 't know . But we need to find out fast . Two people chosen at random . Who 's next ? Whatever 's doing it has the whole city to choose from . Or the world . I knew those two . They argued day and night . That is you . - Right , now I 've seen everything ! - I told you so . You did stand-up ? - I never did stand-up . - Okay , then . A song and dance . I was sensational ! I don 't believe this , Jack . What were you doing there ? - He 's part of this freak show . - Yeah . Some things never change . Are you being rude about me ? Look at the state of them . I do love his leotard . - The night travellers . - The what ? Tosh , play that back . - So , they did exist . - Did you work with these people ? I didn 't work with them , I never knew anyone who did . They only performed in the dead of night . Anyway , it was just a tale that was around at that time . A ghost story . They came from out of the rain . That 's how people described them . Jack , what did these night travellers do ? Left a trail of damage and sorrow wherever they performed . Tosh , can you run this frame by frame ? Er , sure . - What are you looking for ? - I 'm not sure . But something 's wrong . Something 's missing . - This must be years back , now , yeah ? - 80 odd years . Then the travelling shows faded away . No-one came to watch them and without an audience they died out . Forgotten . Until all we have to remember them by were these film clips . Jack ! This film . It 's not the same one we saw at the cinema . - Of course it 's the same one . - No , things are different . Tosh ... Easy to miss at first , but after watching it a few times I realised . Just there . There was a woman in front of that water tank . Yeah there was , Ianto , you 're right . That 's right , I remember her . Wearing almost nothing . And there was a man in like a top hat , a sort of MC . - Yeah . - That 's right . He was reaching down to the audience . Are you sure you brought the right can of film back ? - Positive . - So what are we saying ? That two people from a piece of film have decided to go AWOL ? Yeah . Like you said , trapped in film forever . When they opened the cinema , it gave them a chance . When that kid ran the film , he let them loose . So they 've become physical ? They 've escaped the film ? We need to find out more about the havoc they caused in the past . We need evidence . Possible witnesses . After all that time it 'll be tricky . What , town and parish records ? Sure , we can do that . How far back do you want us to go ? As far as you can . We don 't sleep till we find them . Toshiko , keep checking for sightings . There 's got to be a way of tracing them . Ianto , with me , I need your local knowledge . Oh , is that what you 're calling it these days ? So , two people who should have been dead for years . What kind of creatures are they ? No-one ever knew the night travellers were coming . They 'd just appear from nowhere . Not like the team I was with . We 'd send out flyers , bang drums , blow whistles . Ours was a small company . Working the UK . Trying to find paying customers . I was sent to investigate rumours of the night travellers . - By who ? - Long story . So I joined a travelling show . I was billed as the man who couldn 't die . The night travellers always found an audience . They knew where to look . Step along now , ladies and gentlemen , come and see the show of a lifetime ! Fill your eyes with the spectacle of ... the tattooed man ! Witness for yourself ... the superhuman strength of the Mighty Stromboli ! He can take on Samson , Goliath and Hercules with one arm tied behind his back , and still have strength to dig their graves . Come along now , ladies and gentlemen , the night won 't wait forever . Come and see the amazing Pearl ! She lives in water . She sleeps among the waves . She can reach the bottom of the oceans . She has swum the seven seas . She is the nearest thing that you will ever see to a living mermaid . She will take your breath away . How many other old cinemas are there in Cardiff ? Most of them have been pulled down . And the ones that are left ? Converted . This one is a pub . Four-pint jugs for a fiver and girls in free before 11 . I 'm registering the sea . The sea ? Inland ? Running through the centre of town ? What is it ? I thought ... I thought I saw something . Saw what ? Ghosts . Don 't be stupid . So the Electro is the only one left . Could the night travellers have performed there ? Possibly . If cinema killed the travelling show , maybe this is their way of fighting back . Their only chance to escape before every old movie theatre and piece of film has gone . What better way to get revenge ? They were left forgotten , on pieces of film . And now they 're looking for a new audience . - What is it , Tosh ? - She was picking up the sea . In the middle of town . It 's gone now . I was getting the sound of waves . Seagulls . I could almost smell the ozone . - No other sightings ? - No . What the hell are they up to ? I like the lights . They make the rain glisten . And they 're part of us . Smell the water . Taste it . Careful . - How many now ? - Six . I wish I could see the air they once breathed . You know you can never see it . We could never see it . We have their ghosts here . I can see them whenever I want . Our audience . They 'll never leave us . We can 't see . But we can hear . Listen . I can ! I can hear them . Little last breaths , still sighing their sighs . Can we bring the others ? Make ghosts forever ? The others shouldn 't be in some old dark cupboard . They should be here with us . And I want to travel again , perform . All right . But first we need the rest of that film . Found in a car with their parents , near Hope Street . Oh , no . What happened to the parents ? They 're in the same cataleptic state . They came from out of the rain . What did you say ? Nothing . Why ? Those words , " From out of the rain " . I 'm sure I 've heard them before . Oh , I remember , it was Christina . She was a patient . Here ? No , at Providence Park , it 's a psychiatric hospital . - I know it . - I used to work there . She was a full-time patient , been there since she was a child . Yeah , she was a strange one . Whenever anything , any kind of entertainment show was laid on , she became scared . She 'd run away and hide . Did she say why ? Yes . She said they were coming to steal her last breath . Poor love . I think we 've just found ourselves our first witness . They came from out of the rain . At night . Came to the village . How old were you at the time ? Oh , just a child . Five , I think , or six . Are you visiting someone ? Christina , we 've come to see you . No one comes to see me . Your eyes are older than your face . - Is that a bad thing ? - Yes . It means you don 't belong . It means you 're from nowhere . Christina , tell us about them . The people who came out of the rain . There was music . Hurdy-gurdy music . Acrobats . And a man with fire in his hands . Who else was there ? A man in dark clothes , and a woman . A beautiful young woman in a silvery costume . She seemed to glisten . They touched you , I can sense it . They touched you as they passed you by . Tell us about the man , Christina . Oh . He spoke to me . He asked if I would like to join the travelling show . He took a kind of flask out of his pocket . It was polished like silver . I asked him his name . Oh , I shall never forget it . I never shall . He said he was the ghost maker . He wanted to take my breath and put it in his flask . He said I could travel with his circus , I would be in his audience forever . I turned and ran away as fast as I could . People went missing from the village that night . My mother , my father ... Here we go . Church Stretton , 1901 . People went missing when a travelling show visited the town , and there was one earlier on . 1898 , a small village called Wellsfield . These disappearances , there 's a lot of old wives ' tales attached to them through the years . People still alive but been deprived of breath , children being told to hold their breath while the travelling show passes by . Yeah , this local paper , didn 't take it seriously . Hunstanton Chronicle , March 1911 . " Police and doctors were left quite amused and baffled when Mr. Alfred Mace insisted that his dead wife could be brought back to life providing a certain flask could be found . " He reckoned his wife 's last breath had been taken and put in a flask . A silver flask . And the last breath of each victim . - So that 's how he makes his ghosts . - So if we find the flask ? We can save them . Now we have the film . Time to bring the others . Jack , this is Jonathan , they 're here , they 're at my flat , you 've got to get over here now ! Who was in there ? A woman , lying under water . I thought she 'd drowned . - Anyone else ? - No . Be careful . Did Bernard say he was coming here today ? No . David ... This way , please . - So they haven 't left the area . - They probably can 't . Probably need to be near the Electro . - All my old film cans have been opened . - What was on them ? - Clips from circus sideshows . - They 're bringing more through . Then we need to stop them . Gwen , Owen . Meet us at the Electro . Look , what 's going on ? I 've got to find my mum and dad . If anything 's happened to them ... Hey , there 's that smell again . Like chemicals . Yeah , I can smell it . - Like when you develop a film . - That woman . She grabbed me . But her hand , it was different . It wasn 't like a hand . It wasn 't like flesh . It was it was like touching a piece of plastic , a piece of celluloid . They were on this film for 80 years . Became part of it . - What if we filmed them ? - A film of a film ? Yeah . Then they 'd be trapped . Is this thing loaded ? If they were trapped on film before ... They can be got rid of in the same way . Okay . Let 's suppose they 're made of camphor and nitrate , made of shadows , made of light . - Just enough light . - We film them . Capture them in that ... Then expose the film to as much light as possible . Of course . We 'd blank them out , we 'd lose them . Let 's hope so . - Jack ? - Yeah ? We 're at the Electro . Something 's happening inside . Let 's go . Do you hear that ? - Maybe it 's my mam and dad . - Would they lock themselves in ? No . Please let them be okay . Please . - Mum ? Dad ? - Whoa , take it easy . What 's going on ? Mum ? - No , Jonathan . - Mum ! Dad ! What 's happened ? Please ! Don 't die , please ! Speak to me ! No ! Leave me alone ! They 've been frozen in place , the circus needs an audience . Get him out of here . - Jonathan , come on . - Leave me alone . Owen , find out who 's upstairs . The same pictures as before . Jack . They 're coming through ... Open up ! We 've done it . We 're together again . This place is ours . It belongs to us . This whole city belongs to us ! What are you ? There 's not a breath in your poor , sad body . You 're no use to me . The flask ! He 's got it ! I 've got it ! - Gwen , are you all right ? - Oh ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yes ! Owen , look after the family . Come on . Argh ! No ! Please ! If their breaths escape the flask all the victims will die . Quick ! We could lose them forever ! They 're flat-lining , call the crash team . One . I think we saved just one . I hear it , Jack . I heard it , something inside calling out to me . Okay . So we managed to save one . But which one ? There was nothing we could do . They all died so suddenly . Except this poor little soul . I suppose he 'll be next to go . What are you doing ? I need your help . - What is that thing ? - Please . Just trust me . Give me a hand . Careful . Hold his head . What 's in there ? Something that belongs to him . His last breath ... his life . What have you done to him ? It worked . Welcome back . Those reels of film in Jonathan 's workroom ... I took them out , and destroyed them . Let 's hope that 's an end to it . What worries me are all those long lost pieces of film , tucked away in dusty cellars , hidden in lofts . The night travellers could still be there , somewhere . Just waiting . How much is this ? Jonah Bevan . Disappeared walking home from football practice . Why is this one so special ? Something 's glowing , just out of the camera 's line of sight . Cardiff has an epidemic of missing persons . Oh , my God . I 'll make it my own special project . - No , leave it alone ... - I can 't . - He 's got to be out there somewhere . - Tosh , can we keep this to ourselves ? You 're covering it up , then . In the middle of the Bristol Channel ? What if the rift doesn 't just leave stuff behind ? What if it also takes ? What 's your mate Mulder doing there ? Any reason you 'd be on the barrage that night ? Close this down !

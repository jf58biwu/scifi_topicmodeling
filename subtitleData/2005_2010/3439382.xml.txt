I 've been keeping up with the work you 've been doing with Professor Barnhardt . What does it have to do with this ? I 'll have to crash-brief you in the conference room . Object 07 / 493 was first spotted just beyond Jupiter 's orbit by the Spaceguard program . It was notable for the fact that it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse , but rather , it had a hyperbolic orbit and was shooting through our solar system . The object was moving at speeds of up to three times 10-to-the-seventh meters per second . At first , it was projected to pass millions of miles outside of Earth 's orbit . However , we soon discovered that the object was not following a gravitationally freefall trajectory . As such , its path was recalculated . ( MUTED CHATTERING ) It was at this time a crisis response team was activated and everything you see around you was set in motion . ( EX CITED MURMURS ) Can we launch a missile to intercept it ? The military is attempting to do just that . In fact , they may launch several . But , given the speed at which this object is moving , our chances of success are slim , at best . Why don 't they evacuate the area ? We simply do not have enough time . The affected area contains some 8 million inhabitants . The best we can do is to plan for the aftermath . How long do we have ? Seventy-eight minutes . JACOB : Hey . What did the cops want , anyway ? Well , there 's going to be a big storm tonight , and they needed some scientists to help out , you know , with planning stuff . So ... Pretty soon you 're all gonna go down to the basement , okay ?

If they can 't stop it before it hits , there will be nothing left but dust . It will sterilize the Earth . This is all theater . They 're saying we lost launch capability . - MAN 1 : What ?

NEWSMAN ON TV : Global markets are panicked in early trading this morning in response to the crisis in Central Park . Trading has been halted on the New York Stock Exchange , the Nikkei and Hang Seng , as Manhattan prepares for a massive evacuation . In other cities around the world , people are voluntarily evacuating population centers , fearing that the sphere in Central Park may be the vanguard of an impending alien invasion . The President and Vice President have been taken to separate , secure locations . Until this situation has some kind of resolve , I am the eyes and the ears of the Presidency . So , what do we know ? Madam Secretary , we lost contact with one of our DSCS-3 listening satellites orbiting Earth . What is that image ? Are you saying that sphere in Central Park isn 't the only one ? In fact , we have intelligence that smaller spheres have landed at other locations around the world . Do we have briefings on that ? And , General , where exactly are these spheres right now ? I think we 're asking the wrong questions . What questions should we be asking ? Well , let 's start with this . Where is our satellite ? We lost contact with it . In the scheme of things , the loss of one satellite - isn 't necessarily our concern . - DSCS-3 stands for " Defense Systems Communication Satellite . " Remember what it communicates with ? They were able to access our defense mainframe via that satellite . That 's how they temporarily shut down our missile defenses and entered our airspace . - GENERAL : We 've changed all the codes . - And on top of that , there is a vast amount of vital intelligence on that mainframe . They know everything about us now . - And we know nothing about them . - JACKSON : Almost nothing . The fact that they chose to disable our defenses tells us something about their intentions . Madam Secretary , we brought in several specialists to analyze the tissue samples we harvested from the being . This is our chief geneticist , Dr. Hideo lkegawa . This is our chief astrobiologist , Dr. Helen Benson . - Hello . - Doctor ? The being is in a nascent state . The DNA samples we 've taken seem to represent three distinct life forms . - Three different DNA types ? - Yes , including the being 's brain . The body tissue is human , as far as we can tell . The gray flesh encasing it is organic material , some kind of bioengineered spacesuit . What it resembles , oddly enough , is placental tissue . Which makes sense , given the placenta 's a life-support system . And that , basically , in order to survive in our environment , the being had to be born here , in its human form . They must have come here in the past and obtained a DNA sample from a human subject . Now , since that birth , the being has grown exponentially . This is one hour after surgery . Three hours . Six hours . How much can you tell us about it by decoding its DNA ? You don 't understand . These are the Dead Sea Scrolls . Geneticists are gonna be studying this code for generations . No , they aren 't . This code is the property of the US government . Its very existence is classified . I want to see it . ( BREA THING DEEPL Y ) Water . Bring him up . Does it actually speak our language ? Or does it just parrot what it 's heard ? No , it seems to already understand our language . They 've compromised our satellites . They know everything about us . Mr. Driscoll . My name is Regina Jackson . I 'm the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America . This body will take some getting used to . I 've been sent here to determine who or what you represent , and what your intentions are . It feels unreal to me . Alien . It will take time to adapt . What were you before you were human ? Different . Different how ? It would only frighten you . Do you have a name ? Klaatu . Do you represent a civilization ? I represent a group of civilizations . Where is this group of civilizations ? All around you . What is your purpose in coming here ? There is a gathering of world leaders not far from here . I will explain my purpose to them . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . Perhaps you should explain yourself to me instead . Do you speak for the entire human race ? I speak for the President of the United States . Now , please , tell me , why have you come to our planet ? Your planet ? Yes . This is our planet . No . It is not . We 've decided to sedate him and move him to a more secure location . - Are you going to interrogate him ? - That 's a possibility . Madam Secretary , as scientists , we can 't consent to this . He says he wants to speak to the UN . History has lessons to teach us about first encounters between civilizations . As a rule , the less advanced civilization is either exterminated or enslaved . I 'm thinking of Pizarro and the Incas , Columbus and the Native Americans ... The list goes on . Unfortunately , in this case , the less advanced civilization is us . This is a representative of an extraterrestrial civilization . This is the most important discovery in the history of mankind . It may well be the last discovery in the history of mankind . We need to know what they 're planning , and we need to know now . So you want to drug him ? Interrogate him ? I 'm sorry , we won 't do that . Do you understand ? I understand completely . Of course , if you won 't do it , we 'll have to call in someone who will . Well , I 'm sure you can find someone who will ... I 'll do it . Helen . I 'll do it . ( SIGHS ) That won 't be necessary , Doctor . We 've already prepared the solution for you . I just need a syringe . JACKSON : I want to apologize to you . It seems we got off to a bad start . It seems we did . We 're going to transport you to a different facility - for better medical care . - No , you are not . - Excuse me ? - I am leaving . I can 't allow you to do that . - It is not up to you . - This is a military installation . You 're surrounded by hundreds of soldiers . There 's no leaving here . I have done nothing wrong . You invaded our airspace . That automaton that emerged from the sphere , it attacked our troops . It acted to defend me . It activates in the presence of violence . Dr. Benson ? Please . ( WHISPERING ) Run . It 's done . If you 'll come with us , ma 'am ... Keep moving , please . ( DOOR CLOSES ) I 'm going to ask you a series of control questions . Are you currently in a seated position ? Yes . Are you human ? My body is . Do you feel pain ? My body does . Are you aware of an impending attack on the planet Earth ? You should let me go . I 'll repeat the question . ( ELECTRICITY SURGING ) What gate did you use to enter this base ? East loading door . How do I get there ? One hundred yards left from the back of this building .

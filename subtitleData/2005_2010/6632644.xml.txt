 Hey , Monarch ! Huh ? I 'm taking your fuckin ' car ! 24 ! 24 ! Nooooo ! Nooo ! Agent Samson ! Agent Samson , can you hear me ? Medic ! I need a medic over here ! Heartrate 's dropping . We gotta get that ... schrapnel out of him now ! It 's huge . I need more suction here ... He 's flatlining . Stay with us , Samson ! Oh , you are a squirmy one , Venture . Sit still . Hank ... Hank ? Do you have it ? Over . Yeah , it 's a clean shot . Good ! Hold it there . Dean ? Come in , Dean . Aahh ! What ? Did you stab him to death yet ? No , I didn 't . I lost my knife again . Because I hate it . I 'm gonna take my shot now . I have it figured out that if I can just skim pop 's belt buckle , maybe the bullet will ricochet off it and kill the guy with the gun . Hank , I will give you so much money to not shoot your dad . I don 't wanna do this , Mr. Hatred . I 'm not giving you a choice here ! You gotta stab Hitler ! I can 't ! All right , ya forced my hand . helper , come in helper . helper , murder Hitler . Down boy ! Down ! Down ! Heel ! Giant boy detective , no ! Come back ! Dean ! Don 't look at it ! Shut your eyes , Dean ! Don 't look at it , no matter what happens ! It 's beautiful ! Ahh ! You 're getting face all over me ! Hot melting face ! I did it ... Yep , I hit every light with one bullet . Ow ! Hello ? Anyone ? Well , what the hell do we do with the big lug when he wakes up ? We put him back to work . - The guy 's a damn traitor . - He quit the agency ! Top brass thinks there 's still some use for him if he can be persuaded to curtail certain anti-social behaviors . What 're they thinkin ' ? The old brain drain ? Full memory wipe ? No . That brain of his has got 20 years worth of news we can use . He just needs a little attitude adjustment . Wakey wakey , Mr. Hatred . It 's time to make all those little naked boys in your head go bye bye ... Stop him ! Bring him back to room 2-2-7 and strap him down . Oh , Samson . What 're you doing out of bed- - Oh , hey ! What 'd you bastards do to me ? You were dying ! We saved your life ! Why , so I could be one of your zombies ? I know the kind of shit you do on this level . Sick bay was full of wounded ! We had nowhere else to bring you ! What the hell did you do to me ? Just relax , Samson . Let us take care of you . Oh , god ! Please ... don 't kill me ! I 'm not . No ! No , helper ! Whatever you do , do not engage your helicopter blades ! You 'll kill us both ! No , I won 't . Just trust me . Aaaahhh ! Hank , you take out the lights . I 'll get the Nazis . I mean , if Oswald can squeeze off three hot slugs in six seconds , old Hatred can drop evil Nazis in half that time . Is it me , or does every Nazi wanna clone Hitler ? It 's like the only thing they think of . Seems that way , right ? I guess when everybody hates you , ya fixate on making rotten Hitlers . How can you say that about Hitler ? ! I love Hitler ! And Hitler loves me ! He 's not all bad . Hitler just needs someone to believe in him ! Can 't you just give Hitler a chance ? Dean ! Hitler is a mass murderer ! He 's pure evil ! And you have to kill him ! I won 't destroy the only thing I 've ever loved ! I won 't kill Hitler ! Never ever ! You might want to look at your face . Oh , come on ! I shoulda asked RuPaul to paint my camo face ! I 'll kill Hitler ! I 've killed hundreds of Nazis before . Many of them with a grenade launcher . Medal of Honor , Heroes II . I can also blow up a submarine . He must be killed with this golden dagger . And only after the cleansing of fire . And Dean is the only one he 'll let get close enough to do it . All right , everybody out . I gotta wipe . Good lord , have you been using the toilet under there this whole time ? We are at war with Hitler again ! This is how it 's done on the front lines , soldier ! Hank , hand me that magazine ! We 're out of TP . Hey , um ... Mister ? News flash from the situation room . We 're outta toilet paper ... You told me you hadda make number one , not number two , kid . Well , I don 't speak your special spy code talk ! Come on , dude . Don 't make me do the crab walk here . Fine , kid . Where do you keep the shit tickets in this dump ? The linen closet ! Right down the hall . Hurry ! Jeez , deliver me from 1978 . Did you find it ? No , but I think I found your dad 's time machine . Dammit , helper , if I wasn 't afraid it might stop my heart , I would shut you down . " ' Don 't take another step , ' said Giant Boy Detective , urgently . 'The floor is booby-trapped ! ' 'How do you know ? ' asked Suzy- - " All right , Wishbone . Why don 't you give Giant Boy Detective a rest ? You 're givin ' me a migraine here . I only have five more chapters to go . It 'd be a whole lot more fun if you read Suzy 's parts . " ' Gosh , ' said Suzy , 'How did you know it was the rancher all along ? ' 'Simple , Suzy , ' thundered Giant Boy Detective , his freakishly loud voice echoing off the walls of the old mine . 'Cow patties don 't sparkle . That was gold dust on his boots ! ' The end . " Happy now ? Wow . I did not see that coming . Brock ! I know you couldn 't quit us ! Shh . They can 't know that I 'm here . helper ! I knew you couldn 't quit us ! You gotta be quiet . I don 't have much time . Now where is everybody ? Hank 's in the bathroom with Mr. Doe or something . Pop 's getting yelled at by a bunch of your old friends ... Samson ! What the dog-dammit are you doing back ? Brock , are you ' on the lam ' ? No time to explain . Here . Give this to your dad for me . I gotta go . Wait . Are you taking helper with you ? Yyyyyeah , Dean . I 'm afraid I gotta borrow him for a while . Then here . Take my hoverbike . You keep it , Dean . And tell your brother ... I don 't know . Tell him to " stay gold " or you write something . You 're good with words . Had a total cray-pas situation up there . Took me a while to lock it down . Whoa ? What happened to these guys ? What did you bore them to death ? Brock . H-He was just here . You missed him . Oooh , yeah . And what , he whisked away up the chimney with a thumb of his nose ? Ooh ! Wait ! I think I hear hoofsteps up on the roof ! That 's the X-1 ! Maybe Brock 's back ! You hear that , Giant Boy Detective ? Brock 's home ! His name isn 't Giant Boy Detective . And Dad said he has to go . Giant Boy Detective isn 't going anywhere . Aw , H. E. Double hockey sticks ! It 's the X-1 alright . But that sure ain 't Brock . What the hell did you do to my jet ! ? You , sir , are lucky I returned it . No , you 're lucky it has a homing autopilot function ! What is going on ? Who are these idiots ? This is my LARP crew , The Orchard Street Wolf Pack . They are here to keep the peace . Now step aside ! I have business to attend to ! Finally ! Look what they did to my jet . I think the Monarch 's boys did that . Whatever ! Just ... I don 't know . Kill these guys or something . What you got there ? Foam swords ? We made them ourselves . Mine 's a battle axe . Look , I 'm sorry ! But I 'm in deep doo-doo with this whole cloning thing . The OSI 's on my ass , and now I have these other nut-bags making me clone their dead hero " or else . " I don 't care . I gave you a priceless family heirloom and you deceived me . Now good day ! I 've come to seek council with the necromancer in your village . But you 're a necromancer ! That 's what necromancers do ! That is the definition of necromancer ! Well , yes , technically . But the term is used loosely these days . Magician , wizard , warlock ... they sound rather goofy . Necromancer is all we 've got left . Omelet ? You can 't do anything ? I 'm sorry , I can 't hel - what is that racket ? ! Drop it ! Drop it , boy ! Drop ! Drop it ! He 's been in my reliquary chest ! I 'm sorry ! My dad wanted to kill him ! I was gonna hide him here ! He has the holy arm of Saint Moses the Black of Scete ! Where did he even find it ? This dog has a great evil in him ! That is learned behavior . That 's the owner 's fault usually . You have to show them that you 're the alpha male ! Not even the great Cesar Milan could whisper this hell hound ! Dean , give me your funny pages ! Bad news , Dean . Your dog is the spawn of hell , and you must kill him . Why does everybody want to kill my dog ! ? Because he carries the soul of evil ! I must prepare the ritual of cleansing ! I totally wish that guy lived next to me . Seriously cool . And his daughter is pretty . Bonus ... Hey , aaah , what comic book were you reading ? I 've done all that I can , but he 's highly unstable in this state . We thank you , Herr Doctor . You will be rewarded handsomely in the fourth Reich . Yeah , whatever . But if you fellas don 't find another body soon , you 're gonna be all out of Reichs . Workin ' with Nazis now ? That 's pretty low , even for you . Oh , hey . You Hunter 's friend , right ? Not anymore . I need an operation fast . And you 're the best I know at this kind of ... unorthodox work . Lemme guess - - you want to beat up Hunter but you can 't punch a girl ? So you want me to make a snip , snip ! Meow ! Cat fight ! What ? No . I want you to remove something a little higher up . What made you change your mind ? Huh ? I put in a lot of those this year . Ever since the Iron Man , everybody wants the robot hearts . Yeah , well ... theirs probably don 't talk this much . How come all of a sudden you trust me now ? What 's to stop me from killing you when you 're under ? Him ... Hmm . Oh . Aha ! Okay . And ... time ! Wha ! Oh ... the stopwatch doesn 't have an hour function , so ... whatever . You somehow built your blindfold into your gun . And I 'm pretty sure the trigger doesn 't go there . Hank , where is your uniform ? I 'm not wearing that clown suit . And you are not the boss of me . Au contraire ! I 'm Tony Danza to your spunky Alyssa Milano ! I am full on Charles in charge of you ! You are my unit ! Unit . And a unit operates as one ! We dress the same , we walk the same , we eat the same ! Do you like pineapples and ham on your pizza ? Gross , no . Well you do now ! Why ? Because I do ! Unit ! Now put on your Venture blues before I tell you how much you love country and western music ! Brock is my bodyguard . Not you . Take this . Cool ! Okay . Now shoot me . Huh ? Really ? Henry , I trust you . And if you don 't trust me , I want you to shoot me . Hank . I don 't like Henry . Well I love Henry ! Now shoot me ! Those bullets are like a dollar each ! I 'm taking every missed shot out of your allowance ! Will you two stop it ! When the going gets tough , that boy always gets going . You really want me to shoot you ? I have tried everything to earn your respect . If this is what it 's gonna take to get it , I 'll take the bullet ! Shoot me , Henry ! That 's two dollars out of your allowance , and I 'm still not bleeding ! Hot damn potato ! Ya hit me ! Oh my God ! I am so sorry . Don 't apologize , boy ! Remember this moment ! Remember when we became blood brothers ! Remember when ol ' Hatred took a bullet for you ! Remember the power , the regret , the confusion ! Get it away from me ! Come on , Dean ! helper 's back ! It 's just like when Brock was here ! He just wants a hug , Dean ! It 's time , Steve . I have to do this . Violence begets violence . You don 't have to live like that anymore . They played me for a fool . Double-crossed me . All of them . If I don 't do this , I 'll never be free . Maybe you should wait a while . I mean , you 're not exactly in peak physical condition . I 'm just gonna keep getting softer if I stay any longer . I tried to get you to run with me in the mornings ... You got bionic legs , man . It 's no fun trying to keep up . Aww . Hey , what 's this ? For me ? Well , we couldn 't let you go off on a commando raid half-dressed , now , could we ? I got you guys something , too . I 'm afraid art therapy isn 't really my bag , but ... it 's the least I could do to thank you for all your help . It 's beautiful . We 'll cherish it always . I 'll send you a postcard if I make it . And you ! Stay away from those campers , huh ? I don 't wanna see you on youtube again . Why does everybody suddenly want clones ? What are you guys gonna pay me with , a dog ? I 'm not taking any more barters ! I need cash . You will be paid handsomely . You and your family will live like kings in the glory of the new fatherland ! Wait ! You guys are Nazis ! - Nein , we are not . - Yes , you are ! And that 's like the worst fake German accent I 've ever heard . Vis is undt outrage ! Yours is worse ! Wait ! I get this ... really ? You went with that cliche ? C 'mon , really ? This dog is the Blood Grail ! In his veins flows the blood of our leader . Yeah , Hitler . I 'm not cloning Hitler ! Get out of here . This is not a request . You have eight months to take that dog and make a beautiful pink sweet baby Hitler . If upon our return , this is not accomplished , the consequences will be grave , Herr Dr. Venture . A doggie ! And he likes me . Hank , we can 't wait for Brock anymore . We need a bodyguard . Aw , c 'mon ! The doggie made a poo poo ! Great ! Some fucking master race ... Dean , don 't get attached to that rotten dog , he 's not staying . Burgos , Carl . Serbian diplomat . He 's giving a speech at the U.N. on Thursday and the JSO want him dead . But not in their back yard . Hmph . What 's the offer ? One hundred fifty . Tell ' em two hundred and give it to Zara . Next . Gustavson , Paul . Norwegian industrialist . Greenpeace says the pollution from his factory ... What the- - hey ! What ? Hey ! Who are you ? Are you with the Blackhearts ? None of your business . Get out of here . You get out of here . I was here first . Why don 't you make me ? Last order of business . I think we may have a mole within the organization . Really ? What gives you ... that impression ? Idiots ! Whoa whoa whoa . Easy , there , Babe Ruthless . That 's close enough . Samson ! ? Jeez , is that you ? You have really let yourself go . What 're you gonna do , little man - - woman . I know you know how to stab me in the back , but do you really have the balls to shoot me ? Nope . But she does . All right , let 's say I do it . You do understand that he 'll be a little baby and have none of your friend 's memories . Really ? That 's a gyp . I thought maybe he 'd look like Hank . Fat chance , I lost all my slugs with your friend out there . Fine ! Do it ! I will raise him as my own son ! Anything ! Just bring 24 back to me , please ! Okay , okay ! Let 's see the half mill . This relic belonged to my father 's father . It has been passed down to the first born male in my family 's line . What ? It 's a comic . A comic that has a price on it for ten cents . A comic ? That is Marvel number one ! Look , I wasn 't born yesterday . There is no way that something featuring Ka-zar the Great , and 12 pages of jungle adventure is worth half a million bucks . That 's in almost dead mint condition ! That is CGC rated at 9.6 ! Okay , why don 't you go sell your magic beans to another superscientist with an illegal cloning facility . I 'm done with this crap . Hold on to this . Look it up on the internet . You will see that what I tell you is completely true . And take this . What 's this - - the world 's most valuable cooler ? It 's cloning material . It 's 24 's finger . It still has the Blackbeard 's diamond treasure ring I got him . You can keep that too , I guess . It 's worth two low , low payments of 29.95 . Alright , get out of here . I don 't want to tell my kids about this crap . Sorry about the bad news Highlander . Looks like you 'll never see the Quickening . Huh ? Hey , Pop ! This came for you all the way from Argentina . Hank , this is opened already . I had to , it was beeping . So explosive device never occurred to you ? Hank , you gotta be more careful now ! Your safety net 's gone . I know ... Brock 's gone . Yeah , that too . What is this ? It 's helper 's head wrapped up in Brock 's coat . Good God , he 's been left on . It 's okay . Okay , I know , boy , it must have been a nightmare . Hank , push the eyes for five seconds while I hold this . Are we retrieving his data files to find out where Brock is ? He 's in Argentina near a Mailboxes , Etc . No , this is a hard-reboot . I 'm not about to send a robot to therapy . Can I have Brock 's jacket ? If you 're so excited about worthless garbage , you want this too ? Yeah , totally ! What ? What 's this crap ? Where 's Batman ? ! What is your relationship with the assassin Molotov Cocktease ? How long have you known about our operation ? What operation ? I didn 't even know you guys still existed . You expect us to believe it 's just coincidence that an O.S.I. Agent waltzed into the middle of an ongoing S.P.H.I.N.X. Operation ? I don 't care what you believe . I told you , I 'm not with the agency anymore . I quit . Or they fired me . I don 't even know anymore , man . I see . Well , then perhaps we 'll leave the two of you to discuss what it is we should do with you . " The two of you ? " Helluva pickle you got us into , eh , boy-o ? Hunter ! They got you , too , huh ? Well it serves you right , you two-timing bitch . What the hell are you so P.O. ' d at me for ? So I sicced those three reprobates on you . So what ? You 're Brock Samson , damn it ! Thought I 'd add a little spice to your life . So , what , you did me a favor ? You 're damn skippy , I did ! Got you out of that dead end job and back to doing what you 're best at . And then what ? You were hoping I 'd be so grateful to you and Molotov I 'd join up with your little thrill kill girls ' club ? Sorry , I don 't have the tits for it . 'Coulda fooled me , Poppin ' Fresh . Unless ... you were working undercover ... That 's it . Work it out , Thinkenstein . The sex change , the defection- - it was all a ruse so you could infiltrate Molotov 's group ? Well , you 're half-right so far ... You 're still with O.S.I. , aren 't you ? S.P.H.I.N.X. wasn 't after Molotov- - They were after you ! I knew it ! Boy-o ... you don 't know dick . The cleansing of fire is complete . Now Hitler must die ... again . Bring me giant boy detective ! He ran away . Hark ! Who goes there ? ! It 's okay , Giant Boy Detective . Whose a good dog ? I mean , Hitler . Who 's a good ... Fuhrer ? Alert ! Come in- - Na , na , no , lone wolf . We don 't want to tattle . I can cross " stab Hitler to death " off my list of cool crap I thought I 'd never get to do . Brock ? Hey Hank ... 'killed Hitler ... W-Why are you here ? Why are you wearing that ? Why didn 't you say good bye to me ? - Why didn 't- - - Hank ! Listen buddy . You have to trust me . You can 't tell anybody we were here . This is our little secret . Why did you leave me ? Hank , I 'll never leave you . But right now , these guys need me a little more . You can share me Hank , can 't you ? I mean look how big you got . Can barely get my hands around these shoulders . Hank ! Hank ! I 'm over here ! It 's okay ! I 'm with - - Hank , did you kill Hitler ? No , it was ... it was ... an angel . Oh ... I thought it was you . I was gonna buy you an ice cream cake and stuff . Naw , I was just kidding . Yeah , it was me . I totally killed Hitler .

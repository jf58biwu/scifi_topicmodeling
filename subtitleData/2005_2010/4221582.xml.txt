[ SONG : Never Say Never BAND : The Fray ] The female has the Cube fragment . Soundwave acknowledges . Pursue her . Retrieve it . NEST : Secret Operations , Diego Garcia , Indian Ocean - Autobot twins , report to Hangar Three . Excuse me , excuse me . Hello . Those are nice . Yeah , baby , it 's upgrade time . Yes , oh , yeah . Look here . Come on , let me call right here . Time to get my sexy on with the green . Green ? Oh no , Green is mine , I call green . Be my body . - I got the green . - That hurt , man . It 's supposed to hurt . It 's an ass kicking . Director Galloway , what an honor . Let me show you around but you gotta be in the classified access list . I am now . Presidential order , Major . I got a message for your classified space buddies . You guys made a mess at Shanghai . Alright , so this is where we communicate with the JCS . And this area serves as the Autobots ' hangar . Secured line to JCS is up , Major . US Military Satellite - Secured line to the Pentagon now . - Saw the Shanghai op . It was a rough day . - Yes , sir . - We have intel that I believe warns an immediate debrief . - Now with your permission , I can 't let you see him - but I would like you to hear from the leader of the Autobots . Proceed . You gotta wonder . God made us in his image . Who made him ? General , our alliance has countermanded 6 Decepticon incursions this year . Each on a different continent . - They 're clearly searching around the world for something . - But last night 's encounter came with a warning : - The Fallen shall rise again . " The Fallen . " Meaning what ? Origin : Unknown . They only recorded - history of our race was contained within the All-Spark , - lost with its destruction . Excuse me ! With this so-called " All-Spark " now destroyed , why hasn 't the enemy left the planet like you thought they would ? - Director Galloway , our national security advisor . - The President just appointed him liasion . - Well , I guess I didn 't get that memo . Forgive the interruption , General . Excuse me , coming through . Excuse me , excuse me ... After all the damage in Shanghai , - the President is , uh ... hard-pressed to say the job 's getting done . Now , under the classified Alien Autobot Cooperation Act , - you are agreeing to share your intel with us , but not your advancements in weaponry . We 've witnessed your human capacity for war . It would absolutely bring more harm than good . But who are you to judge what 's best for us ? With all due respect , we 've been fighting side-by-side in the field for two years . We 've shared blood , sweat and precious metal together . Soldier , you 're paid to shoot , not talk . Don 't tempt me . And the , uh ... - The newest members of your team ... - Easy ... I understand they arrived here after you sent a message into space . An open invitation to come to Earth , - vetted by no one at the White House . Let me stop you right there , Mr. Galloway . It was vetted right here . - And in my experience , the judgement of both Major Lennox and his team has always been above reproach . - Well be that as it may , General , it is the position of the President - that when our national security is at stake , - no one is above reproach . Now , what do we know so far ? We know that the enemy leader , - classified NBE-1 , AKA Megatron , - is resting in peace - at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyss , - surrounded by SOSIS * detection nets - and a full-time submarine surveillance . We also know that - the only remaining piece of your alien All-Spark - is locked in an electromagnetic vault , - here on one of the most secure naval bases in the world . Decepticons , we have located the shard . - And since no one ... can seem to tell me what the enemy is now after , well , there--there 's only one clear conclusion : You . The Autobots . They 're here to hunt you . What 's there to hunt for on Earth besides that ? " The Fallen ... shall rise again " ? Sounds to me like something 's coming . So let me ask if we ultimately conclude that our national security is best served - by denying you further asylum on our planet , will you leave peacefully ? Freedom is your right . If you make that request , we will honor it . But before your president decides , please ask him this : What if we leave and you are wrong ? That 's a good question . Oh , my gosh , look at this place ! I feel smarter already . Ron , can you smell it ? Yeah , smells like $ 40,000 a year . Okay , cheapo . Go ahead , we 'll , uh ... We 'll get your stuff . Just go ahead and check out your room . [ SONG : 21 Guns BAND : Green Day ] - Hey . - Hey . You must be Sam , right ? I 'm Leo . Hey . Uh , sorry , I already set up the crib . Do you want this side or that side ? - That side . - I already chose that side . You know what this is ? This is the awkward moment . Yeah , so you 're trying to see if I 'm a normal guy , I 'm trying to see if you 're a normal guy , balanced and medicated enough for another curl space . Good personal hygiene won 't stab me in my sleep .

Anybody can do it on any computer , okay ? And I wasn 't , uh ... there . So I can 't comment or speculate . - Oh , no . - " Comment and speculate " ? We 're supposed to go habitate ? No , listen , okay . Don 't be sucking the sack , bro . - Whose sack ? - Look , the ball sack . - Dude , what kind of tool are you ? - Mainstream media sack .

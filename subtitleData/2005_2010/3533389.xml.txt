 { \ pos ( 270,240 ) } Now , in addition to all the museums and art galleries and other great stuff here in our nation 's capital , there 's one thing you 're gonna love probably more than anything else ... the dinosaurs . This way . Stick together . Agent Bering ? - Hi , Chet Greenfield . - Hello . - Sorry I 'm late . - No problem . My assistant said you double-checked everything yesterday . I did , but I 'd like to run a full review before we lock it down . Sure . - With you . - Me ? You 're the boss . I 'd like to avoid any chain-of-command confusion . I tell you , and it gets done . - Shall we start in the main hall ? - Well , I understand , - but I 'm pretty booked up { \ at the moment } right now . - I apologize for the inconvenience . - I 'll clear my schedule . - I 'd appreciate that , sir . Good morning , Kacey . I just figured out who you are . You 're a fireman . No . Come on . You know absolutely everything about me . Well , that 's because you talk a lot . Gordon , this is agent Bering with the Secret Service . Gordon Letanik ? And what 's ... What 's this ? An Aztec blood stone . The boss of virgin sacrifices . Handsome devil . I 'm just cleaning him for the reception tonight . Agent Bering wants the group D artifacts moved to the west wall . They 're blocking an exit . Lose Tuvalu and Malta . Move Britain to the back . If it still doesn 't fit , see me and we 'll cut something else . Yes , sir . I 'll just finish up . What 's next ? The main floor bathrooms . I 'll need the plumbing pulled again . I would try to sneak you in , but the Secret Service will be there , and they can be jerks . So I 've heard . Call you soon . You promise ? Promise . Bye now . Champagne ? Thank you . Champagne ? Cham ... Status check on Eagle . - Who 's on Emerald entrance ? - Me . Morris . Why aren 't you at Emerald ? Well , because I 'm here . - How 's Home Base ? - We 're calling Home Base " Magenta " . Well , I 'm not . - You changed the protocol . - I tweaked it . I wrote it . And I didn 't use colors . Why weren 't you at my briefing ? I was vetting one of the servers . - Screwing off is more like it . - Well , you say po-tah-to . - Get back to Emerald . - You 're not my superior . Dickinson gave this to me . I 'm running it . - Meeka . - Myka . I get ... vibes . Sorry ? This isn 't some run and gun that you 're used to in Denver . - Get to the point , Lattimer . - Dickinson gave you this shindig with my protocol because my specialty is logistics , framing ... and I kid you not , there is something really off in here . Eagle at Magenta . Mr. President , wait a moment , please . This is Bering . Eagle is free to enter . Negative , negative . This is Lattimer . Hold Eagle at five until further . - Copy ? - Copy { \ that } . Holding Eagle . Get back to Emerald . Look , Myka , why don 't you pull your head out of your Magenta and feel the room . - Something 's off . - Listen , Showboat . Nothing 's off . The room is fine . Everything is fine . Now take your vibe ... and go . - Enjoy your party . - I will . I want a perimeter check asap . - Emerald clear . - Peach clear . - Orange clear . - Gold clear . Crimson clear . There 's ... There 's blood , so ... Pete ? - What are you doing here ? - Working . Is there a fire ? - Excuse me , sir . Wait just a second . - Secret Service . This is ... Gotta go . Excuse me ! Excuse me ! That 's an okay for Eagle to enter . Affirmative . Clear Eagle . Freeze ! Drop the knife . Hold your fire ! Seriously , Gordon , drop the knife . Drop that . - Whatever it is . - Can 't do that , Pete . Weapon . We 're done here . Tell me you found the guy . The guy who you said stole the rock ? We 're gonna need a sample . Come on , Dickinson . Well , you said , among many strange things , - that the rock was bleeding . - It was . Taxpayers will probably wanna know if you were high , paranoid , or just part of an Aztec art theft ring . In the meantime , you 're suspended , with pay , for two weeks , till we get this thing worked out . - What about Morris ? - He says nothing happened at emerald . Okay , can we ... stop with the colors already ? What about ... the guy with the knife ? - What , Letanik ? - Yes . He 's in a coma . Docs don 't know why or how long that 's gonna last . - And Bering ? - Myka 's being thanked personally by the President and the first lady . - Of course she is . - She 's going places . You , on the other hand , you 're going to the bathroom . That 's funny . Mr. Lattimer . My name 's Frederic . Frederic what ? - Mrs. Frederic . - Well , that 's a relief . I 'm with the government . I 'm here on a matter of national security . - What 's that ? - An invitation to endless wonder . Could you sound a little more creepy ? Read it . Please note the action code . It is legitimate . - You 're part of my bailiwick now . - Your bailiwick ? - You 're working for me . - For you ? - Am I stuttering ? - No , ma 'am . All right , I get it . It 's a ... this is a joke , right ? Dickinson put you guys up ... This is Dickinson being funny , right ? Do I look like a joke ? You 're to be in South Dakota at those coordinates at noon tomorrow . You will mention our meeting and your pending assignment to no one . Is that understood ? How long am I gonna be in South Dakota ? - Indefinitely . - Indef ... no , no . I 've got a life here . Really ? I 've got ... things . Pack light , Mr. Lattimer . We 'll ship what you need and store the rest . Prepare to turn right in 100 feet . Turn right now . You have missed your turn . Go back . Turn right . Destination straight ahead . You gotta be kidding me . Endless wonder . It 's agent Lattimer ! I 'm here ! Great . - I heard you were suspended . - Yeah , I heard that too . Why are you here ? I was ordered here , last night . Mrs. Frederic . Said it was a matter of ... National security . Right . How are you guys doing ? I 'm sorry I 'm late . I had to fix the fish . - Stop right there . - What are you doing ? This is the guy . { \ You know , } The one from last night . - The guy who stole the rock . - You stole the rock . It 's a blood stone . It 's safe . It 's inside the building . It 's the property of the museum . And that museum is property of the { \ US } Government , so is the warehouse . And so am I. I 'm secret service . I also work for Mrs. Frederic . I 'm Dr. Nielson . You can call me Artie . Got some ID ? We take the secret part seriously around here . I just wanted to thank you for your assist in last night 's retrieval . That was very good . Did you throw that foot ball at me ? You weren 't here when I threw it . It takes a while to circle back . Come on inside . - I 'll show you around . - Around what ? What am I doing here ? I 'll explain everything inside . Come on . I made cookies . Come on . Really , it 's okay . Go inside . Don 't go far ! Okay . Come on in . Wait for me at the bottom of the stairs . It 's fine . Don 't touch anything . Don 't touch the bombs . Hold this . Hold it . Come on . It 's okay . Right this way . Ms. Bering , Mr. Lattimer , welcome to Warehouse 13 . - I 'm thrilled you 're on the team . - What team ? What is this place ? Officially , K-39 triple-Z on the North American grid . But ... I like to think of it as America 's attic . Projet-SG ( 1.00 ) Pete , close the door . Tell me exactly what I 'm doing here . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Exactly ? That 's a little dif ... { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Well , to put it plainly , { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } you 're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets . Put it plainer . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } This ... This warehouse ... { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } { \ Well , } Look , the Warehouse needs you . It needs ... Pete , don 't touch . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } It needs your combined talents . { \ I mean , } He 's intuitive , and you 're ... { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } { \ I mean , } You 've got a scrupulous eye for detail . He 's scattershot , { \ you see , } and you 're meticulous . You look , he leaps . There 's been a mistake . I 'm too valuable to be wasted here . No offense . - Of course not . - Can I use your phone , please ? { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Mine ? { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } It 's broken . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } - { \ Well , } I have to make a phone call , so ... - There 's no signal here . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Yeah , you 're ... You 're ... Just pull ... Pull the door , and you 'll be ... now . There you go . I think she had other plans . So did I. You want juice or are you a milk person ? - You know what I 'd really like ? - I do indeed , but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point . - Milk it is . - Yeah . - That 's Mrs. Frederic . - Long time ago . - She looks exactly the same . - Odd , isn 't it ? You don 't want a cookie ? - So who are these guys ? - Former colleagues . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } And where are they now ? This one and this one are dead . This one , a mental institution in Germany . And this last one ... { \ pos ( 192,205 ) } disappeared . One day I 'll find him . Ted , these are two of my best agents . How can you not know ? I 'm looking at the order . You processed it . How { \ * can you not } can 't you know ? Hold on . - Dickinson . - Sir , it 's Myka Bering . Sir , I have a little situation here . I 'm not sure ... Yeah , yeah . You know what ? I 'm looking at the transfer order { \ right now } . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } The name on here is Frederic . You 're transferred to where ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - Where are you ? - { \ Well , } I 'm in South Dakota . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - Where ? - South Dakota . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - What are you doing in South Dakota ? - You don 't know about this ? No . Who is Frederic ? Sir ? Sir ? { \ pos ( 192,205 ) } - Who 's this Frederic ? - Sir ! Yes , yes . { \ pos ( 192,205 ) } She handed me orders last night to come here to a warehouse in South Dakota . The order code was solid , and Lattimer 's here too . Look , I 'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to DC . { \ pos ( 192,185 ) } Myka . Myka , I can 't do that , okay ? This order trumps me . Let me get on this , { \ and } I 'll get you back here asap . - What should I do ? - Follow orders . - { \ pos ( 192,205 ) } Those orders , both of you . - And how long will this take ? Sir ? Sir ? Are you still there ? { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } That 's a pile of crap . { \ pos ( 192,225 ) } - No kidding . - No , I 'm not kidding . You 're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure . - Oatmeal scotchie ? - No . Thank you . I don 't eat sugar . Good for you . Listen ... Please don 't think of this assignment , you know , as some sort of punishment . - Can you hold this ? - What ? You know , yeah , your presence here is not really a reaction to what happened to you in Denver . So ... I got a commendation for what happened in Denver . Yes , you did . It 's time for the nickel tour . Come on . The order trumps Dickinson ? The first Warehouse 13 was built in ' 98 . - So we 're stuck . - Until he works out a transfer , yes . 1898 . We didn 't have a handle on how to store stuff . It burned down . Some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts . What 's stored here , exactly ? This and that . Bric-a-brac . Some things along the lines of ... last night 's rock and roll . I 'm talking about the blood stone . Both hands ... on the bar , please . I think I 'll survive a crash . No , that 's not a safety bar . It 's a conduit . You and Pete are the power source . Your combined electrical energy makes this thing move . It 's fine , it 's fine . Look , Thomas Edison built this automobile for Henry Ford as a proof of concept , and it 's perfectly safe . Trust me . Put your hands on the bar . Put your hands on the bar . Thank you . We need both of you . Hands on the bar , Myka . Thank you . Edison , he wanted Ford to let go of oil , but Ford , no , no , he stuck with it because it ruined his engines faster . People had to keep buying them . - What is that ? - What ? That is training flight 22 . We pulled that from the Bermuda Triangle . The Triangle 's been trying to pull it back ever since . Duck and cover . It 's harmless . The inventory kicks up a little static from time to time . Why are you grinning ? Well , don 't you think this stuff is kind of cool ? I mean ... - Where is he ? - I don 't know . He 'll be back . - Hello ? - We should stick together . Right this way , please . Many of the items in here , kind of like the blood stone , Pete , that you wrestled with last night , the channel of tangential energy ... Well , tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced the museum employee , last night , into ... well , into almost committing murder . - So how does that happen ? - { \ Yeah , you know , } We 're not really exactly sure how . It goes back to Einstein , and E equals ... Yeah , okay . Somehow ... the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter . You know , like you . - Move me where ? - Into trouble . Bunk . Is gravity bunk ? Magnetism ? { \ You know , } These are mysterious forces that we live with { \ every day } , but we can 't explain ' em . { \ I mean , } Can you even explain to me how a radio works ? And you don 't { \ really } care , as long as you get the traffic report { \ , right ? } . But if a radio landed in the hands of Thomas Jefferson , you know what Jefferson would do ? He would just lock it up until he figured out it wasn 't gonna kill him . And that is exactly ... what we do here . We take the unexplained ... and we just safely tuck it away in this super-sized Pandora 's box . - Metaphorically speaking . - { \ Well , actually , } Pandora 's box is over in aisle 989B . Empty , of course . Do the world a favor and clear your mind . Well , that should be easy . How did that get there ? 'Cause I didn 't pick that thing up . It still amazes me how that thing moves . { \ What ? } What ? What is it ? Don 't talk , don 't hope , don 't wish for anything . - That kettle grants wishes ? - Yes . Now Pete , look at me . Just keep your eyes on me . Open it . Pete ! Pete , this ... This is a neutralizer . You can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that act up . Now look , I want you to come over here and { \ I want you to } drop that { \ very } slowly , right in here . { ow listen , } There are items around here , if you were to put it in there , they would generate a { \ * big } flash , but this { \ little thing } will { \ probably just } be a little spark . But you may flinch , and I don 't want { \ you } to , 'cause you could drop it , okay ? - Well , I have a wish . - Don 't ! - You wished for a ferret ? - No . - That was already in the thing . - I don 't think so . You wished for a transfer , didn 't you ? Impossible wishes , wishes that can never be granted , they produce a ferret . Don 't ask me why . My first year here , the whole place was crawling with ferrets . - I swear , I didn 't pick that thing up . - No , I know , I know . Not everybody is affected by everything . Here , okay ? You have to be metaphysically predisposed . And the external energies , they have to be in alignment . - This is just a convergence thing . - Right , sure , okay . So we 're ... we 're all converged here , but I still have no idea what I 'm supposed to do . What you 're supposed to do is hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world 's day , { \ and } neutralize it and bring it here . You gotta snag it and bag it and tag it . This is crazy ! This is crazy ! { \ Well , y } You know , I don 't ... It could be , you know , crazy fun . { \ Well , t } That 's { \ exactly } the attitude that brought you to our attention . Do you guys want a cookie for the road ? What road ? There 's rooms for you at Leena 's Bed and Breakfast . It 's about 7 miles down the road that way , and I 'll join you there in the morning and I 'll tou ... { \ well , } I 'll just join you there in the morning . Stay close ! Seriously , Lattimer , there 's been a serious screw-up . I 'm serious . And now you have a ferret . What ? This town ... Is this a town or what ? - What 's the name of it ? - Well , it 's more like a street . So it says here to turn left at Buffalo Station . What ? No , no , no . It 's " Buffalo Statue " . Well , your penmanship is atrocious . I don 't need wise ... You know , that 's ... You know , don 't do that . Can you finish a sentence ? A full thought ? Would you really like me to ? Wait . No , no , no . Don 't ... don 't call Dickinson . - He hates being pestered . - I don 't pester . { \ Well , w } When he knows something , he 'll call . Clearly the phrase " rolling with the punches " is not in your vocabulary , so may I make a suggestion ? What might that be ? Unbunch your panties ... and make the best of a bad situation . And how do I do that ? Which part ? You 're a freak . Hello . I 'm Leena . You must be Pete and Myka . Come in . I 've got your rooms ready . We serve three meals , 9 : 00 , noon , and 5 : 00 . We 've got radios in the rooms . No tvs . No in-room phones , but there is one there at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway . You may choose any room . Is there anywhere I can get a drink ? I mean , a drink ... drink ? - What would you like ? - Whiskey neat . - I can do that . - Please do that . She hates traveling . She loves traveling . It 's the places she 's traveled to that 's the problem . - Can I get you anything ? - No , I 'm fine . Just ... - Is everything okay ? - You 're a lucky man , Pete . I am ? You 're in tune . Very rare . I don 't know what that mea ... Look ... are you ... are you connected to Artie ? Let me know if your bed is big enough for you . Hey , buddy . - How 'd it go today ? - Not bad . { \ pos ( 192,230 } Lattimer seems interested . { \ pos ( 192,230 } And Ms. Bering , not so much . { \ pos ( 192,230 } Did you select a case for them ? { \ Yeah , Listen . } I don 't mean any disrespect , but are we really sure { \ that these are } they 're { \ the people , } the right people ? Because ... I 'm fully aware of their baggage . Now what 's the real problem ? Artie , take yourself off the hook . Their fate falls on me . You say that ... Dickinson wants them back . You 've got to get them locked in . Can 't sleep ? Yeah . Me neither . We don 't have to talk . So ... - Do you always eat when { \ you 're } stressed ? - Do you always talk this much ? You know , no light from the city to get in the way . Nothing but sky . This time of the year , we get Leo , Cygnus , Sagittarius . You know this how ? My dad and I used to camp a lot . Where is he now ? Sorry . What about your folks ? Colorado Springs . They own a bookstore called Bering and Sons . - How many brothers ? - No brothers . Just me . My dad thought the " and Sons " sounded classier . { \ Well , h } He must be proud of you . Mom is . Well , did protecting the president of the United States turn him around ? This won 't . From Denver to DC to a warehouse security guard in six months . Now there 's a career trajectory . Look , about Denver , I didn 't mean to spit on that last night . What you did there was better than textbook . We 're not discussing that . Ever . All right , well , I 'm gonna ... go back upstairs ... and not sleep some more . Earlier , did you hear a ... Hear what ? Never mind . Dickinson will call . He better . Rotation , time , Seever City . Come on . So it 's gonna be you , then . Cody Thomas , a law school grad student , at the university of Southern Iowa . - Iowa ? - Yeah , Iowa . His parents were killed in a plane crash . He is a really good kid { \ . He 's been } , putting himself through college with the settlement . Why are we going to Iowa ? To find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge . - What edge ? - He struck his girlfriend . That 's it ? So far . For the past five days , I have been reviewing 11 possible cases , looking for whatever doesn 't fit , something out of place , like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife . Because of a rock that isn 't just a rock . I 've got a hunch that this is the one . What exactly are we looking for ? Well , you tell me . It 's bigger than a breadbox ... Or smaller . If there is an artifact at the heart of this , then I 've prepared a few questions for Cody that might reveal it . Actually , it 's more than a few questions , but ... " Do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday ? " If they say yes , then we could ... They probably won 't say yes . It 's unlikely . - { \ But } We could be dealing with time slip . - Or a hangover . Please take this seriously . I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar { \ a } few years ago , { \ and } that question saved my life . And the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky . What happened to them ? Their clocks ... Stopped . So , what ? They died ? { \ Well , } They 'll wish they had in 100 years or so . Anyway ... Neutralizer . The purple stuff . If you find the artifact , just drown it in there , like this , if you can . And if it 's too big , you just take this and throw it , and then call me . And don 't ask me how it works , because I have no idea . And it doesn 't always work . And don 't ingest that stuff , because you 'll ... see things . And we 'll stay in contact with these . I have one just like it . - Two-way video communication ? - I call it a Farnsworth . Named after Philo Farnsworth , who invented that in 1929 , right after he invented the television . Isn 't that remarkable ? I mean , anyway , if you wanna talk to me , just press that button . What is that ? Nicola Tesla , Thomas Edison 's chief rival or nemesis , depending , he cooked this up as an alternative to bullets . It 's a ... It 's really ... a kind of electric stun gun { \ , really } . A polyphase ass-kicker . Now , that 's ... Just here . Just don 't put it past two to begin with . That 's the trigger , right there . You should practice with it first . One blast and down you go . Don 't point that at me . Keep your finger away { \ from the trigger } . Just don 't . Give him the gun . And also , it zaps short-term memory , which is why agent Morris doesn 't remember seeing me at the museum . And that 's it . That 's what ? Go to Iowa . Talk to Cody . Find the artifact , if it exists . Neutralize it and bring it back . Don 't get killed . - How 's her aura ? - Tortured . Guilt and grief , mostly . She has a soft spot for the ferret { \ , though } . Just like you . Now that was a long time ago . You haven 't changed that much . She had a stowaway . I found this in her room . Oh , Lord , that 's Houdini 's wallet . Fingers ! That was a bad spike . That landed on something with her . I requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago . And every year since . - I 've told you this . - A few times . You 'd think Mrs. Frederic could maybe get that done . Don 't look at me . Well , I had the FBI in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing . All egos out to here and all looking like they 're wearing daddy 's suit . Well , we feel the same way . { \ Well , just } Let me know if the thing 's going federal so I can { \ get } prepare my staff for the media . It 's not going federal . We just have a few questions and then we 're gone . It 's Dickinson . - { \ We 'll } Just { \ be } a sec . - Yeah , this is Bering . - How you doing ? - { \ Well , } We 're in Iowa now , on assignment . - Any luck in getting us back ? - The bad news is not so far . The good news is , I 've got a line on this Frederic woman . She worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s , and after { \ that } ... Well , it 's not the same woman . The woman we met was younger . I 've got a Frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox . { \ It 's being } Funded from a black ops budget I 'm still trying to source . { \ Well , } I can fill you in . These lines aren 't secure . Listen to me . I 'm doing everything I can to get you and Pete back here . 48 hours , tops . So just follow your current orders and keep your head down . Wait , sir ! Sir ? So how 'd he sound ? 48 hours . - Yeah , but how 'd he sound ? - Not good . - What kind of questions ? - { \ Well , } They 're sort of diagnostic . Diagnostic . { \ What , } Like I 'm sick ? You 're Secret Service doctors ? Question number one . " Have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life ? " Something like { \ what ? } ... An object of some kind . Do handcuffs count ? Question number two . " While looking up , do you have the sensation of falling ? " I don 't feel like I 'm falling . - Next question . - Okay , question number three . " Have you recently smelled something that could best be described - " as fudge when there is no fudge ? " - Fudge ? Is that ... Question four . " Do you have ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time ? " Okay , so ... We 're done with those questions ... What do you think happened with your girlfriend ? - What 's her name ? - I don 't know . Emily . I don 't know . I don 't remember . I was in class , talking to the professor about some mock trial thing . { \ Then } I woke up here , and they told me I beat Emily up . - Have they let you see a doctor ? - Yeah . - Says I 'm fine . - And no ... - No alcohol or drugs ? - No , I swear . No history of blackouts ? This isn 't me . I would never hurt Emily . This isn 't me . This isn 't ... Se li uomini sapessino le cagioni della paura mia , capir potrebbero il mio dolor . Get him out of here ! Let 's get him down to secure lockup . Well , that was scary . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Can you come this way , son ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Hello . I 'm Lorna Soliday . I 'm Cody 's lawyer . And did Travis call you ? Sheriff Travis respects the law , and he doesn 't like being railroaded by federal agents . Are you that hands-on with all your clients ? - Just my godson . - So you knew his parents . Very well . And neither Cody nor I will be answering any more questions - until I know what this is about . - We 're interested in Cody 's behavior . - His violent behavior . - As in , where 's it coming from ? What is this ? Someone pegged him as a threat to the President ? Not yet . Not ever . That 's not Cody . { \ Well , } It was Cody that just destroyed that table { \ in there } . Not to mention what he did to his girlfriend . Does the secret service investigate every case - of battery among college students ? - Nope . Just this one . - So where 'd the Italian come in ? - What do you mean ? He spoke Italian in there , just before he decided - that the interview was over . - I don 't know anything about that . Well , has Cody come into contact with anything unusual , say , in the past few days ? - Yes . You two . - That was a serious question . That was a serious answer . Any more questions , Sheriff Travis has my number . You felt that , right ? I 'm not sure what you mean . It got hot . But you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out . The vibe . Right . Okay , so how do those things work ? Is there false alarms or ... - It happens all the time . - So why do you trust them ? One time I didn 't , and I should have . You 're right . It 's Italian , sort of . I mean , this is either part gibberish . I don 't know . It 's some kind of code , maybe . And my software can barely translate any of this and says " dolor " means " pain . " And a text search came up with nothing . There 's no films , no books , no plays , no songs , no poems . So what now ? You 're right beside a college campus . You can go find somebody who speaks Italian . Excuse me . Professor Marzotto ? We 're with the secret service . Oh , my . It 's an old construction . 15th century . It 's not working-class Italian either . This is high brow . - So what 's he saying ? - Roughly ? " If people knew " the reasons for my fear , " they 'd be able to understand my pain . " Do you visit Italy a lot ? I haven 't been back in nearly two years . But you 're sure this translation is correct . I 'm a Renaissance scholar . I 'm sure . One last question . Do you know a student here named Cody Thomas ? I know of him . I read about him in the paper . It 's a sad story { \ , that } . - How so ? - Well , you know . He was a good kid , from what I heard . And he had some sort of a breakdown . All right , well , if we need you to translate anything else ... I 'd be more than happy to help . You can reach me at that number . Great . Thank you . He 's hiding something . Did you see his neck pulse ? Don 't you have a scrupulous eye for detail . - He shelves his books alphabetically . - I didn 't notice that . And he puts pens in one cup , pencils in another . Now you 're scaring me . Did you see where he put his pen right before we left ? Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal at your parents ' bookstore ? - Something got Marzotto going . - And you . I don 't like being lied to . I 'll remember that . { \ So , what ? } Do you want to go back and hit him again ? No , I want a hard phone line . I thought this was a colossal waste of time . Not anymore . Hold up . - Do you always walk so fast ? - Yes , I do . Are you coming ? I have an incoming code Madrid for Minnie Harris . Reply 6955 . - Hi , Minnie . - Hey , hotshot . - How 's the White House ? - You know , it 's a lot smaller than it looks on TV . How are you ? - Chad and I are dating . - Very nice . Yes , it is . - Look , I need some information . - Okay , shoot . Edward Marzotto , one " z " two " t " s . - Professor at Southern Iowa University . - Turnaround ? I need it now . Sorry , I know this is big . It 's not a problem . { \ You can } Hang on and I 'll give you the highlights ? - For sure . - Thanks . Hang on . I 'm sorry to bother you . Government agents are asking me lots of questions I can 't answer without getting you and me into a lot of trouble . It 's about the book . Your boyfriend is quoting from it . How 's Myka ? Edgy , irritable . You know , Myka . - Why ? - Just checking . Listen , there 's something I forgot to mention before . - What ? - Just before Cody got physical , there was some kind of a ... I don 't know , a heat wave . It just rolled right off of him . This happen after a question ? No , he was talking about his girlfriend , Emily Krueger . - You talked to her , right ? - No , not yet . All right . Listen , I 'm gonna check out that heat thing , and { \ I 'm gonna } see if that relates to anything . And ... meanwhile , what was that translation ? " If people knew the reasons for my fear , " they would be able to understand my pain . " Do you want me to ... Do you want me to run that again ? I got it . You 're positive that 's the translation ? Absolutely positive ? Yeah , I mean , that 's what Marzotto said . - I 'll call you back . - Okay . Got some good stuff . Edward Melville Marzotto . - Melville ? - Yeah , I know . Anyway , the man loves his Italian art . He just got back from Italy eight weeks ago , and the cops think ... Hey , bunny . - Slow down . - Walk faster . So what 'd you find out ? What happened in there ? Tell me . I heard a ... I thought I heard ... a voice over the phone that I really should not be hearing . Same thing you heard at Leena 's . Look , sometimes we ... We hear things - and see things that aren 't there . - What I heard can 't be there . - It can 't be . - Then it 's not . I mean , maybe it 's post-traumatic stress . I read the press release of what went down in Denver . - Lives were saved . - Lives were lost . You 're a hero . You 're gonna put me on a psych eval , aren 't you ? Why would I do that ? Because you need to be able to depend on your partner . All right , well , then you 're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you 're okay . We 're gonna finish this case , we 're gonna get out of here . We will . I don 't know if I can . I don 't even know what we 're looking for . Yes , you do . I mean , whatever doesn 't fit . You know , something that 's out of place . Marzotto lied to us . He said that the last time - he was in Italy was ... - Two years ago . Yeah , my contact told me it was eight weeks ago . How 'bout that ? I wonder what else he lied about . - I guess we need more information . - Yes , we do . - Cody 's girlfriend . - Emily Krueger . I need a picture ! { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } Just give me a picture . { \ pos ( 192,240 ) } Give me a picture . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Don 't make me come down there ! All right . I know this is ... awkward . And I feel terrible , but ... You can 't keep it . I don 't know what I was thinking even taking it out of Italy , but it has to go back . I 'm going to Rome next week . And that 's coming with me . What 's that for ? I hate this part . - Emily , you 're late . - Sorry . We were setting up for the party . Can I help you ? Emily Krueger ? I know your pain , trust me . We saw you leaving professor Marzotto 's office , didn 't we ? Oh , right . I was there for a meeting . For the play . I 'm in it . Marzotto 's sort of a technical advisor . Does he know about your relationship with Cody ? He knows what happened . Why ? Because when we talked to him about Cody , he didn 't mention you . Or that you 'd just been to see him . Maybe he was trying to protect my privacy . - Why did you guys mention Cody ? - We needed something translated . Yeah , have you ever heard Cody speak Italian ? Just once , when he did this . - How long have you known Cody ? - Since the eighth grade . Got serious after his parents died . I came here for theater . He applied for law school . His godmother helped him get in . - Lorna Soliday ? - You met her ? - Does she have any family ? - Just Cody . And that 's not even real family . She made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died . Do you know what it means ? " If people knew the reasons for my fear , " they would be able to understand my pain . " - Does that mean anything to you ? - Only that he 's afraid of abandonment . It scares him . Maybe he thought that I was spending too much time on the play . I don 't know . Can I go back to work now ? Ten to one this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus Artie 's pushing . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } How 'bout a billion to one ? How about a cute girl { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } in a play by Machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Or ... or try this . Emily , an actress , is a ruthless gold digger . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } She 'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend { \ pos ( 200,230 ) } to get him made enough to hit her . { \ Right ? } She goes for the money . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Sues him for it . { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } What kind of women do you date ? - It 's Marzotto . - What ? The attendant said he heard him speaking Italian before he doused himself . Hold on . Why 'd you talk to marzotto ? Who told you that ? Secret service hits campus , and people notice . And now he 's dead . Before this , you said something to make Cody { \ Thomas } want to knock your heads off . - { \ Is there } Something you want to tell me ? - We should talk { \ about this } later . - Let me tell you something ... - Sure . { \ Tell me } Something that makes it seem like I couldn 't kick your ass in front of your men . Boys , can we put our badges back in our pants , please ? Sheriff . What was that ? - We gotta get to Marzotto 's office . - And how are we gonna get in ? Hotshot . What the hell is Warehouse 13 ? We haven 't met . I 'm Mrs. Frederic . - How 'd you get in here ? - Through a door . Warehouse 13 , is it yours ? It 's mine . And so are Lattimer and Bering . Excuse me ? Can I ask you something ? Shoot . Never mind . The vibe thing ? My dad was a ... fireman . When I was 12 , I got this feeling one morning that I was never gonna see him again . And you didn 't say anything ? I didn 't want him to see how scared I was . He died that night in a house fire , saving a couple of kids . I 'm sorry . Me too . So now when you get a feeling ... - He got his pen out of his pencil cup . - At least he died happy . That 's not funny . You 're right . That 's strange . What ? The " m " s are out of order . There 's something in there . - Is this it ? - I don 't know . - Well , what if it is ? - Then we 're done . - So open it . - You open it . I don 't want another ferret or whatever . - Se li uomini ... - Don 't . Just in case . - What 's that ? - Something 's missing . Let 's call Artie . Miss Soliday . - What are you doing here ? - You heard what happened to Marzotto ? Yes , Sheriff Travis just called . Now get out before I call him back and tell him you 're searching this office without a warrant . We 're here investigating his suicide . Ed didn 't kill himself . - He had help . - What do you mean ? Somebody broke his heart . We were together for three years . And then we weren 't . I thought we were in love , but things change , and he chose someone else . A student ? Did Emily Krueger break his heart ? And Cody 's . She 's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants , and then when she 's done using them ... We 're looking for something , something about this big . We think Marzotto had it , but now it 's missing . Did Emily get it , you know , whatever it is ? Why don 't you ask her ? She 's helping with the party for the play . Cody 's there . - Cody 's out ? - Emily dropped the charges . - Okay , we should go . - I 'm coming with you . If you 're confronting Emily , I need to be there for Cody . Let 's go . I gotta lose weight . Do you think Emily would ever hurt Cody ? Not physically . Even if she tried , she couldn 't . And why not ? Me . Cody has me . I made a promise to his parents when I became his godmother that I would always be there to protect him . It 's only a matter of time before Cody realizes Emily 's just small-town trash . Cody is destined for great things , and I 'm helping him succeed . With me , he can do anything or be anyone he wants . Could you pull over for a sec ? I know you . Well , that 's a good sign . Where am I ? Hospital . In Iowa . Seever City . What happened ? Car accident . You 've been out for two days . How 's Pete ? Lattimer 's still unconscious . We don 't know . There 's someone here to see you . Someone who 's gonna help you get back to where you belong . The President ? Better . Hey , bunny . Hey . You know you shouldn 't be here , right ? I could say the same thing about you . I think you just did . I 'm hurt . That didn 't stop you in Denver . - I was late . - No , bunny . I was early . I jumped the gun . You 're dead , Sam . You need to get up now . You got a lot of things you need to do . Get up . You have to get up now . Get up . Wake up , buddy . Can you hear me ? Come on . Here we go . All right . - Wait , wait , wait . - What ? What ? What ? - You 're giving me a wedgie . - What ? Just ... you okay ? Sit here and don 't move . I 'm just gonna get the book . If you find a badge , it 's mine . Never mind . I found it . You okay ? Soliday crashed the car . You think ? Where is she ? She 's not here . She had ... some kind of jewelry in her hair , like a comb thing . It looked old , like it would fit in the book . - Pete , you 're bleeding . - I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Just ... here , answer that . You 're looking for jewelry . This , this thing . Yeah , we know . We just saw it in a woman 's hair . - She tried to kill us . - A woman ? What woman ? Her name is Lorna Soliday . She 's ... Part of the ruling class , single , successful { \ . She 's } , middle-aged . She 's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones . { \ And s } She 's connected somehow to a young man , { \ a young man } that she believes needs her protection ? He 's good , yeah . What 's the matter with you two ? { \ Are you two all right ? } Okay , anyway , look . This comb is transmitting Lucretia Borgia . - Lucretia who ? - Borgia . She 's a cutthroat Italian who ruled Italy in the 1600s with her father and brothers . My family owned a book store , remember ? That 's right . So what do you mean the comb 's transmitting ? An alchemist made it , okay ? Out of what , I don 't know . It 's supposed to be some kind of Renaissance roofie . Somehow the crystals in the ionized metal { \ in this thing } are affecting brain chemistry . - What about the phrase ? - Yeah , the phrase . That 's like some kind of phonetic trigger . This is a very , very , very unhappy woman . Very unlucky in love . - There 's supposed to be a jewelry box . - We found it in Marzotto 's office . He must have given Soliday the comb . Like her , she wants love at any cost . She wants love , and she is gonna kill to get it . She wants ... She wants Cody , so she wants Emily gone . And Emily 's at the party . What are you talking about a party ? { \ Party ? } What party ? God . Some renaissance blowout for some Machiavelli play . Machia ... This woman 's gonna be there ? You 've gotta stop this woman . Lucretia Borgia , 600 years ago , started a bloody reign of terror , and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again . It 's got twisted desires , and it 'll amplify , it 'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus . First to Iowa , then to Nebraska , then to Illinois . We understand . Probably first to Illinois and then ... Okay , look , we need to get you to a hospital first and ... No , look , I 'm trained to take a bullet if necessary . But ... I 'm not sure how to stop a dead Italian cougar . We need some kind of approach . Well , I have no more color-coded plans . There 's a silver lining . Okay , I 'll go in , grab Cody . - You flank . - No , you flank . Trust me . That 's not creepy . How you doing ? That 's nice . Come on , man , you don 't wanna do this . Look . You don 't wanna hurt her . Just let Emily go . He intends to . Her dying scream will be the trigger ... Look , nobody 's screaming , okay ? We 're gonna take a deep breath , and we 're all gonna come back down to Earth . Cute . Kid 's fast . What 's your pain , Lorna ? What are you afraid of ? You know . And so does she . Show 's over . Drop the comb ... thing . Did you really let your lover die ? - Shut up . - For a chance at glory ? I said shut up . Don 't look at it , Myka . Yeah , sorry . No one 's dying here tonight . But you might lose a tooth . Duck and cover ? - What did I do ? - It 's okay . It 's over . Love hurts , I know . So here 's the deal . You got a choice . You can come back to DC . Or you can stay with the new assignment . - What 's the catch ? - I only get you . Lattimer has to stay there . - And if I stay , what happens to Pete ? - He still stays . - How long do I have to think about it ? - About five more seconds . Four , three , two .

 Previously on Heroes : I must have gotten your ability on the street . Ability ? Peter Petrelli ? Hiro . You 're supposed to be the man with the plan , remember ? I 'm not sure I 'm that guy anymore . Well , it 's just , you know , kind of sad when you look back on your life and you realize it hasn 't amounted to much . What are you talking about ? Your whole life has been about trying to help people . But I don 't remember actually helping anybody . The guy don 't know his name , what day it is , nothing . I 'm gonna help you . You 're a watchmaker from Queens who murdered your own mother . No ! What are you waiting for ? A broken vessel . An empty shell . What is a man without mind , without memory ? A ghost ? A body in search of a soul ? With no compass to guide us , how can we know if our destiny is to seek the good ... or obey the demons that whisper in our ear ? The blank slate hungers to be written upon . The body thrives when the heart has a mission . How you feeling , Hiro ? You collapsed in my apartment last night . You remember ? Mm . And you brought me to the hospital ? I spoke to the doctors . Hiro , you 're very sick . Yes , I know . Brain tumor . I 'm dying . I guess I didn 't want to believe that I would end up in a hospital bed so soon , but ... here I am . Look , I know about dying . I 've helped a lot of people through this transition . And I 'm gonna help you with whatever you need . Maybe that 's why you came to me . Maybe . But maybe not . Destiny has been sending me to different places , different times , to right many wrongs before I die . Maybe destiny has brought me to you , Peter ... To fix a problem in your life . No , my ... My life is fine . I really don 't need any fixing . What if you didn 't come here so that you can fix me ? What if you 're here so that I can fix you ? I 've seen the best doctors in Japan . There 's nothing that can be done . Maybe not by doctors . The faster I can go ... the faster I can get back . Go ... go where ? Just sit tight , okay ? I 'll be right back . Okay . Are you okay ? Did you send a cello to my apartment ? A cello ? No . There 's something wrong with my ability , or whatever you call it . There 's nothing wrong ... It 's confusing , at first . I know . It 's difficult for everyone in the beginning . And I want to talk about it with you , but I can 't . Right now I have to leave . Leave ? My friend is dying , and it can 't wait . You know what ... You have questions about abilities ? You should talk to him . He knows everything there is to know about abilities . His name is Hiro . Talk to him , and I 'll be back soon . Where are you going ? To save his life . He 's not what you expected . For years , I 've heard rumors , stories . Sylar , the most powerful one of all . But that man seems beaten . Afraid . What happened to him , Lydia ? I 'm not sure . It 's like there are two sides at war within him . Good morning , Sylar . How 'd you sleep ? You called me Sylar . Who 's Sylar ? That 's you . That 's your name . The police told me my name is Gabriel . You don 't even know your name ? What happened to you ? I don 't know . I can 't remember . You know what I think ? I think a great damage has been done to you . And you 've come to us to heal . Walk with me . Spend the day among us , and with time , your memories will return . What do we call you ... Gabriel ? Sylar ? Take a deep breath . What 's the first name that pops into your head ? Call me Nathan . Why are you doing this for me ? I mean , you 're taking me in , hiding me from the police . You don 't even know me . Of course I do . You may not realize it , but you 're a man of great powers . Powers ? Last night at the police station , I raised my hand and somehow threw a man across a room . What 's wrong with me ? Oh , there 's nothing wrong . You 're special . Take a look around . Here , everyone is . Hey , Teddy , show him what you can do . You mean everybody here ... Is like you . Like us . Lydia , come meet our new friend . Show him around a bit , will you ? I think you two are gonna like each other . My pleasure . What is it ? I remember shaking a lot of hands . Like I was a politician or something . Is that possible ? I suppose anything is possible . Come on . - Hi . - Laundry day . Is this a bad time ? No . Come on in . How goes job hunting ? Unproductive . Well , hang in there . It 'll work out . Thank you . Can I have some quarters ? - I need , like , 12 of them . - Yeah , sure . Over there in the jar . Help yourself . Don 't take this the wrong way , but have you ever thought about doing a little volunteer work ? Oh , wait ... Peter ? How did you get in the bathroom ? It 's been a long time since I 've teleported . I need you to deliver some tickets . " Captain Lubbock , Baltimore PD . " Isn 't this the guy who was hunting Sylar last night ? Something is very wrong . The memories are returning , but they 're the wrong memories . There 's someone else inside his head . We need to jump-start the real Sylar . Wake the sleeping lion . If the real Sylar sees this cop coming at him , he might kill him . Indeed , he might . Hiro 's dying ? He doesn 't have to if I can find a healer . That 's why I came over here , Noah . I want you to help me locate one . What about my blood ? Can 't you take me back with you ... We can give him a blood transfusion ? That won 't work . A tumor is living tissue . Your blood 's regenerative powers would only make it grow faster . But there was a kid , bag-and-tag of three to four years ago . How long does he have ? Hard to tell . It could be a couple months . Could be a couple hours . Yeah , that 's him . Jeremy Greer . I found him when he was 13 . I was getting a report of a kid that was bringing squashed bugs back to life . Back from the dead ? Well , no , not exactly . But if just a leg still twitching , all he had to do was touch them and away they would fly . We studied him for four days and , of course , erased his memory . He was a good kid . Or he wanted to be . He couldn 't decide if his power was a gift or a curse . Well , if he can save Hiro , it 's definitely a gift . Cainan , Georgia . - You ready ? - Yeah . Samuel 's brother , Joseph , began the tradition of morning chores . He believed that hard work helped bind a community together . Well , I 'm certainly looking forward to getting my hands dirty . I haven 't done an honest day 's work since , uh ... since I can 't remember when . It 's nice having you here . We don 't see a new face among us that often . Especially one so handsome . Hey . How you doing ? That Lydia always had a thing for bad boys . What do you mean ? I 've heard about you , Sylar . How you steal powers from other people . How I ... I 'm sorry , man , I literally have no idea what you 're talking about . I 'm sure you can do some fancy tricks . But you know what ? I have some tricks of my own . Uh ... okay . Excuse me . Wow . Those are kind of in the way . Are you gonna stop this ? Boys will be boys . Why don 't we let the others finish up here . There 's someone I 'd like you to meet . It 's so strange when that happens . My hand just rises up and can suddenly do these incredible things , like motor memory . Memories don 't only exist in the mind . The body retains everything . I remember flying . You mean flying in a plane . No , I mean , like piloting a jet . I flew jets in the military , maybe . A politician 's life , jet pilot . It all sounds like a very exciting life . But it isn 't yours . Someone 's done something to you . Polluted your mind somehow . I thought your true memories would return on their own , but it 's just not happening . You want to know who you really are , don 't you ? Of course I do . Then it 's time for stronger measures . Damian . This is Damian . He has a powerful gift . In his hands , your true memories will be returned . Are you ready to know the truth ? Yes . Take him to the House of Mirrors . Oh , go away . I have no more blood left . No more blood . Blood ? I 'm sorry ... I read lips , but yours move differently . Oh , sorry . Japanese accent . - I 'm Emma . - I 'm Hiro . Yeah . Peter Petrelli said I can ask you questions about my ... abilities . You have a power ? How can I make it stop ? No , manifesting a power is a wondrous time . A hero never refuses the call . I 'm deaf . I can 't hear the call . Oh , you must have many questions . Just one . How do I turn it off ? It 's not a light switch . It 's part of who you are . Sorry to have bothered you . Dead plants , dead bushes . Not exactly what you 'd expect from a healer , huh ? So what do you know about this kid ? Well , not much . You know , I tested him . I wrote up a report , threw it in the file . But the kid was just coming into his ability . He had a lot of questions , so naturally we wiped his memory , sent him back to his messed up family . And I went on to my next assignment . The Company was never what you 'd call a support group . Yeah , more about powers and less about the people . That 's right . But you saw him heal , right ? Yeah . Bugs . Dog that got hit by a car . Day four : I slashed my arm pretty bad . The kid touched it , it was good as new . Guess his power doesn 't work on birds . - That smells like ... - Death . Hello ? Is anybody home ? Oh ! Hello ? Oh ... Noah . Noah . Ugh . - The parents . - What the hell happened here ? There was a case in China . This woman manifested as a healer , but as time went on , it evolved into something very different . There was a flip side . She could control the flow of life ... - Give it ... - Or take it away ? Yeah . Jeremy ? Jeremy , is that you ? Gabriel . - Hello , Gabriel . - Mom ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , no ! No , this isn 't me . This isn 't me . Why are you doing this to me ? Make it stop , please ! Make it stop ! So tell me about your ability . I have an ability too . I am the master of time and space . Well , I was . Lately , time and space has been the master of me . Oh , is that my brain scan ? No . Mine . I see sounds . They make colors . A new ability can be frightening . But you must not turn away from it . I want it to stop . Huh ? I don 't think he 's shooting to kill , Noah . He 's just warning us to stay away . Still , we 're talking about a scared kid with a small cannon in his hands . - All right , I 'm going up . - No . I need to talk to him . There 's a staircase out back , though . Yeah , yeah . I 'm on it . Jeremy ? Jeremy , I 'm coming upstairs . Unarmed . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Talk to me , Jeremy . Say something . Stay away , all right . I 'm warning you ! No , I 'm coming upstairs , so if you 're gonna shoot , lock and load . I told you to keep away ! Why ? What happens if I come near you ? Everything I touch ends up dead . Captain Lubbock . I 'm Samuel Sullivan . Glad to see you and your family could make it . I appreciate you sending those tickets over this morning . But I gotta ask ... why me ? Ah , we always try and do something special for local law enforcement . I heard about you on the news last night . Out chasing down some escaped prisoner ? You 'll indulge me . I 've been showing this to everyone I can . Got a lot of people on the hunt for this one . Don 't think I 've seen him . But I could be wrong . A lot of folks come and go around here . Well , if you spot him , call me right away . I absolutely will . Enjoy the carnival . Mrs. Lubbock . No ! No . No . Stop . Make it stop . Please , please ... Oh , my God . Oh , oh ... Oh , my God ! Oh ... oh ... Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh ... oh , my God ! My God , no . This isn 't me . No ! Please make it stop ... No ! Please . No , this can 't be me . This can 't be me . Please make it ... No ! Tell me what happened . Don 't come any closer ! Okay , I 'm right here . I 'm right here . What happened to your parents ? I killed them . I was angry , and I just ... I touched them ... and they died . - I didn 't mean to do it . - I know you didn 't . You know , what 's happened to you , Jeremy , it 's ... it 's not fair . You never should have been left to suffer through this alone . And who are you ? You don 't remember me , but we 've met . I know you . I know all about you . I know about your power . And I know that you 're not a killer . You 're a healer . I used to heal things . And then it turned . And now I kill ! No , you 're still a healer . - You can do both . - Stop . If you come one step closer , I swear to God I will shoot you ! Noah ! No ! - Peter , stay with me . - Oh , my God . Peter . Peter ! Peter , stay with me . Peter ! - Oh , my God . - He 's bleeding out . He 's never gonna make it to the hospital . You need to heal him . - I can 't . - Yes , you can , Jeremy . I 've seen it with my own eyes . You need to come over here and lay your hands on him now ! - If I touch him , he 'll die . - He 'll die if you don 't . You can do this . Listen to me . My power is understanding people like you . That 's what I do . What happened to your parents never has to happen again . You can control it , and you can heal him . Everything I touch dies . I 'm touching you right now . You can do this . You can give life . Come on . Focus , Jeremy . Visualize Peter healing . Imagine what it 's gonna look like when the wound disappears . His eyes open again , and he is healthy and alive . Picture it , Jeremy . Keep that thought in your mind . Oh ... Welcome back . Yeah . Ta-da ! And now , to assist Hiro the magnificent , please welcome to the stage Emma the ... also magnificent ! Hiro , what are you doing ? Magic . Oh , and we are going to need much applause for the next feat of magicalness . I will make Emma ... disappear ! It 's like time is ... Standing still . It 's all so beautiful . There are no bad powers , Emma . You just have to understand them . And when you do , you will learn to use your powers to do good things in the world . Oh , but please , for now , our magic trick . Hide behind the curtains . Over there , yeah . Abracadabra ... Alakazam ! Where did she go ? Where is Emma ? Oh , Emma ! Oh ... Emma ? Oh , Emma ? Oh ... Where are you ? There she is ! Ta-da ! A big applause for Emma the magnificent ! Oh , but we have to give applause in a different way . Like this . All those murders ... All those memories in my mind , but I cannot believe that they 're mine . How many did I kill ? A dozen ? Two dozen ? I 'm sorry for your pain . Truth can be difficult . Difficult ? I am a monster ! I stalk people and slash open their skulls . Has it ever occurred to you to question what brought you here ? Why providence has seen fit for our paths to cross ? This place is a safe , protected womb . But out there is a cruel world filled with people who persecute our kind . Can 't you see ? They made you what you are ! They turned you into a monster . - Oh , that makes it okay ? - It makes it the truth ! You wanted to know who you are . And now you do . The question now is : Where are you gonna go from here ? Do you wallow in self-pity , or do you learn to use the gifts God gave you and command fear and respect , and defend against those who would do us harm ? All in the embrace of a community who loves you for exactly who you are . You just met me . You would take me in here ... Knowing what I 've done , knowing who I am ? We 're family . Family accepts . Family forgives . There 's a problem . That policeman who was hunting you , he 's here . It 's not just about you anymore . We 're harboring a criminal now . What do you want me to do ? I ... can 't make that decision for you . But your presence here puts all of us in jeopardy . Something has to be done . Where is he ? One of my men saw him going into the House of Mirrors . I don 't know what to do with him . A leash . A cage ? Maybe a cattle prod . Now ... You keep your Japanese tush in this bed ! I am not a pet . She 's right , Hiro . You 're sick . You need to stop using your power before it kills you . But my power isn 't killing me . It keeps me alive . When I was stuck in my cubicle every day , wasting my life , that 's when I was dying . How can you be so focused helping others , knowing what it might cost ? I had a friend once . She knew she was dying , but ... that didn 't push her off her path . She told me to keep joy and dignity alive , even in the face of death . Her name was Charlie . Oh , my God . I can 't believe I left her off the list . What ? What are you doing ? Paper and pen , stat . I had a list . A list of all the wrongs I have to right before I die . I can 't believe I forgot her . Hiro ... Promise me you won 't leave until Peter returns . There 's been an accident at 2627 Otsego . Please send the police ... and the coroner . Did you get his ability ? Yeah . So what next ? Well , there 's an air field about six miles south of here off the highway . I called in a favor and I got you a ride . It 's not as fast as the way you got here , but ... - You 're not coming with ? - No . Better hurry . Hiro 's waiting . Okay , so , I jerry-rigged the heater . And I backed up the vent . It 's gonna look like carbon monoxide poisoning , okay ? You came home and you found them . All right ? You 're staying here ? - Yeah . - How long ? Till I know that you 're all right . Jeremy , it used to be my job to watch over people like you . But somehow I , um ... I lost my way . I dropped the ball . You may not even know it , but I let you down . Come on . Hands above your head ... now ! Now ! You need to leave here now . While there 's still time . I got a better idea . You resist arrest , then I have an excuse . I 'm just trying to save you . Unh ! What are you ? Don 't just stand there . Get a mop ! That was beautiful . You promised you would stay in bed . Joy and dignity in the face of death . Just like Charlie . Come on , back to bed . Hiro . You 're safe now . Tonight ... We welcome a new brother into our family . He will live and work among us ... and will be welcome here all the rest of our days . There , there , Edgar , don 't pout . Good thing I followed that bastard . I had a feeling he wouldn 't follow through . Aw , he 's just a baby learning how to walk . What use is he to us like this ? What use is a lion that can 't kill ? Maybe it 's better this way . We just make a better Sylar . And when we do ... he 'll be ours forever . Peter . Emma . I 'm sorry it took so long . How is he ? - Hiro 's gone . - What ? He disappeared . Just disappeared . " Save Charlie . " Charlie !

 Previously on Heroes ... There 's a lot of change going on with me . Really ? It 's like , when I look back on my life , it just seems like it 's not my life I 'm looking back on . It 's a mid-life crisis . That 's all this is . Pete , it 's me again . I have left you three messages . You need to call me . Something 's happening to me , and I think you 're the only person who 's going to understand what it is . For years , I put my job ahead of my family . Now I 'm eating cereal for dinner , and a strange man is answering my wife 's phone . That 's no way to live . So what did we win ? A compass . A broken compass . You can never change the past . It 's bad . If you want to change one thing ... that 's all you do . What if I could make it so that Danko wasn 't interested in you anymore ? Why do you want to do this for me ? Maybe we 're both looking for redemption . I want my old life back . I go back to my apple martinis and overpaid lobbyists . Excuse me . Tracy ? Is that you ? Hello , Governor . I 'm back . Nathan . Mom . What brings you to D.C. ? You cleaning out the garage ? Yes , as a matter of fact . Here , come look . Just what the doctor ordered : A trip down memory lane . Last we spoke , you said something about looking back on your life and it feeling like someone else 's . Well , Nathan , this is your life . Gee , Mom , you didn 't really have to do that . Yeah , I don 't recognize any of this stuff . Well , of course you do . Come on , pick something up . Ma , really , I got to ... Here . Used to be your favorite toy . Uncle Tim bought this for me when we took that trip up the coast . I was in the back seat of the car . That 's when you decided you wanted to be a fighter pilot . You remember ? Yeah , I remember it like it was yesterday . Literally . Is there something wrong , Nathan ? No , everything 's fine . Come on , what happened to you ? I mean , it feels like you fell off the face of the Earth . - It was family . - Oh . It was a family crisis . It was complicated and dramatic , and it 's behind me . So , you 're back . I 'm back . And I 'm looking for work . Not anymore , you 're not . I can use you back in New York . That is , if you 're willing to come work for me . I 'd be a fool to turn it down . Terrific . So what 's going on ? I could use your help to ease some legislation through the mine fields . You know , cut a few corners , charm a few regulators . It 's right up your alley , Trace . Right , baby ? Not a problem , Governor . Have dinner with me ... tonight . We can discuss the particulars . So happy to have my tiger lady back . Peter . Hey , Noah , you got a minute ? Sure , come on in . I thought you wanted nothing to do with me . I need to show you something . That 's a very nice arm . No , it- - There was a tattoo . Right here . I noticed it last night . Mystery tattoo ? No , it was a compass . Just like the one that you pulled - out of the safe deposit box . - Mystery compass tattoo . I know where you 're going , Noah . And I 'm not seeing things . It was there . I thought you 'd help me ... I don 't know , what are we going to do , though , Peter . Seriously , are we going to go on the road , and search for this speedy guy with the knives , and uncover some giant conspiracy ? Not particularly . You want to get cut up again ? No , I don 't . That 's what I 'm telling you , I 'm not up for it . That 's all . Got it . So what am I doing here ? - Sorry to bother you , Noah . - Hmm , fine . Not at all . Any time . - Claire . - What are you doing here ? I , uh ... I had to ask your dad a question . He was helping me clear my head up , but ... I 'm good . I got to go . I , uh , I got to be at work in ten minutes . Ten minutes ? You live in New York City . New power ? Ask your father about it . Just a , uh , fishing expedition . Doesn 't amount to anything and it 's over . Can I get you something to eat ? A , um ... bowl of cereal ? Val , before you put that in , the guy didn 't tell us he was diabetic . Pete . I left you three messages . I 'm so sorry , man , I 'm so sorry . I 've been slammed . Are you okay ? Yeah , I need to talk to you . - Can it wait ? - Five minutes . So what 's up ? Whoa ! When did that start happening ? A couple days ago . I 'm like a Swiss army knife of superpowers now . It 's a new power every day . Guess it runs in the family . Yeah , but there 's something else . - What ? - I 'm seeing things , Peter . Memories . Images . Memories , but they 're not my memories . Not exactly . I 'll touch something , and ... It 's freaking me out . Uh , I 've read about this . It 's called psychometrics . It has something to do with seeing the history of an object , where it 's been , what it 's experienced . So what I 'm seeing , it 's real ? Possibly . I don 't know , why ? What are you seeing ? You remember Kelly Houston ? Kelly Houston . Before or after she ran away and broke your heart ? I don 't think she ran away , Pete . I really don 't . I touched my old baseball hat , and I got a flood of images of her and me in a pool . I know how all of this must sound . But she was dead , and there was blood everywhere . You think somebody killed her ? I don 't know . If what I 'm seeing is real , then yeah . What would you do ? Then you got to find the truth . Go by the house . I mean , her mother still lives there , right ? Millie ? Yeah . Okay . You want me to go with you ? No , it 's my mess . I 'll clean it up . Tell me the truth , Claire . Why are you here ? You checking up on the old man ? No . Can 't a daughter just drop in on her father unannounced ? I worry about you . Since Mom 's gone and the Company 's not around , you just seem plan-less . You always have a plan . I 'm fine . That " fine " sounds very unconvincing to me . You 're not fine . You 're living off of cereal and Japanese take-out . Well , that is a good point . Tonight , I order Italian . What about a job ? What about it ? Well , I know it 's a down economy and all , but I 'm sure there 's something you can do . Well , my particular skills aren 't really all that marketable . That is not true . You were middle management of Primatech Papers for over 20 years . During which time , my skills consisted of lying to my family , breaking down doors , bagging and tagging . On the plus side , you are a people person . Look . Oh . Lumber salesman . Minimum five years sales experience . Ta-da ! You do know that was a cover , right ? I never actually sold anything . Yes , but you don 't have to admit to that . Okay , say you 're at the interview , and I 'm the interviewer , - and you 're the interviewee . - Oh , are we really- - Tell me , Mr. Bennet , what do you think your greatest strength as a salesman is ? Well , if they won 't buy from me , I can always just shoot them . Nathan Petrelli . Millie . What are you doing here ? Reminiscing about Kelly . I happened to be in the neighborhood . Thought I 'd stop by and say hello . That calls for a drink . What can I get you ? Oh , nothing . I 'm fine , thanks . Sit down , Nathan . Thanks . Nobody ever talks to me about Kelly . Guess they figure it 's a sore subject . Truth is , I 'm made of sturdier stuff . So ... ? I was just going through some old things in my office . I started thinking about Kelly . Got to wondering if you ... If I 'd heard from her ? Well , I wish I could say that I have . Wish I could say that all this time , she 's been living in the South of France . That she became an artist . That she has a daughter named Francoise . Do you ever wonder if ... maybe she didn 't run away ? To be perfectly honest , there was a time when I thought maybe you knew more than you were saying . After all , we were away that weekend , but you were in town , Nathan . And I knew that you and Kelly had been seeing each other . I never told your mother , but I hired a private investigator . Turns out , you 're in the clear . Kelly , in fact , used her credit card to buy a one-way ticket to London , Heathrow where she claimed her checked baggage , and no one has seen or heard from her since . You think it 's possible something else might have happened , Millie ? Trust me , I 've been over this ad nauseam . Kelly was willful and spiteful and full of herself . Add to that , me not being the most attentive of mothers . It 's no wonder she ran off . I 've got a hair , nail and body sculpting thing , and I don 't want to be late . I understand . So , you 'll show yourself out ? Of course . Here you go . Broke out the good stuff . I 've already had too much . And my mom would kill me if she found out . There 's no way she 'll find out . You 're right . You know , my folks won 't be back until Monday . Is that an invitation ? Do you want it to be ? I don 't know . You 've been drinking . I wouldn 't want to take advantage . Don 't be such a prude . You want it , Nathan ? Come and get it . Come on , Nathan . Come and get it . You better give me that . Come and get it . - Come here . - No . No ! You wanted to see me ? Millie called . Chardonnay . She said you came to her asking questions about Kelly . Do you have any idea what your trip down memory lane is doing to that poor woman ? Thank you . Kelly didn 't disappear . She died . I was there . What I want to know is why I can 't remember any of it . How would I know ? Because every time there 's a secret buried someplace , I find you with a shovel behind your back . You should write Mother 's Day cards . I 'm going to get to the bottom of this , one way or the other , so you can tell me , or ... Fine , I took care of it . And you don 't need to know the details . You made sure I wouldn 't remember anything , didn 't you ? You were drunk and foolish , so , yes , I took care of it . All of it . I had the Haitian wipe your memory . I disposed of her body . I bought the plane ticket to London . It was an accident . No , it didn 't look like one , dear . So what would you have me do ? Her death would have ruined your life . I 'm just waiting for the part that makes any of this okay . I made a choice to protect my son . You want to vilify me for that ? Fine , I have been vilified for so much less . But , please , Nathan , don 't destroy yourself over this . So what , you 're going to have , your old friend Millie go on believing that her daughter ran away because she was a bad mother ? Yes , Millie has made her peace with this . I suggest you do the same . I 'll be in touch . Did you forget something ? There 's something I need to tell you , Millie , and I 'm not sure how to do it . You all right , Nathan ? Look , I can 't tell you how I know this , but I 'm not really sure I should . What are you talking about ? Say it . Kelly didn 't run away . She died . And I was there . It was an accident . And it was my fault . She got on a plane . There was no plane ticket . She died , Millie . And the whole thing was covered up by my ... family . What kind of twisted , pathetic game are you playing ? I 'm just trying to tell you the truth for once . I think you should leave . Please . Go . I 'm sorry . So you never answered the question . - Greatest strength . - Greatest strength . Well , I would have to say that above all else , I am ... a company man . You won 't find anybody more dedicated ... to his job than me . See , that 's perfect . What lumber company wouldn 't want to hire you ? Yup , I 'm a real people person . What 's the matter ? Oh , I don 't know . It 's just , you know , kind of sad when you look back on your life and you realize it hasn 't amounted to much . What are you talking about ? Your whole life has been about trying to help people . Has it ? 'Cause all I see is pain . I shot them , cuffed them , locked them up , wiped their memories , but I don 't remember actually helping anybody . That 's not true . You 've helped plenty of people . Yeah , name one . Me . Life changes . We all change . Sometimes you have to remember who you were to figure out who you want to be . Why do I suddenly feel like you 're the parent , and I 'm the kid ? - We 'll take turns . - Yeah . So , you don 't really want to sell lumber , huh ? Nope , not at all . Hiro . Hiro . Hiro . Fancy meeting you here . Am I that predictable ? You live upstairs . How are you ? Okay . So what brings you to my neighborhood ? I got my old job back , with Governor Malden . Well , that was quick . Good for you . Let 's celebrate . I 'll buy you a tuna roll . Yeah , I 'm not really hungry . So why are you here ? I don 't know . You got your life back , Tracy . And that 's what you wanted . Isn 't it ? It just feels like something 's missing . Something needs to change . Well , you got a job in government . That 's a good start . Please , Malden isn 't about helping people . - Then quit . - I can 't . Do you know how many people would kill for my position ? Life changes , Tracy . We have to change with it . Maybe you just can 't go home again . Maybe you have to remember who you were to figure out who you want to be . Oh , I got to go . I have a dinner with Malden , and I can 't be late . Thanks for the advice , though . Any time . Oh , I can 't tell you how great it is to have you back , Trace . I missed you . - It 's nice to be missed . - Yeah . Uh , Cosmo still your drink ? One Cosmo , please . Look at us , huh ? Just like old times . Kind of . This job ... I want it to be more . I want to set agendas , help people who can 't help themselves . So much for small talk . I want a job where I 'm making a real difference in people 's lives . Trace , you don 't have to work so hard to impress me . We both know what you bring to the table . Tell you what . Why don 't we skip dinner ? Let 's go upstairs . Make each other happy . Just like old times . Will you excuse me for a moment ? Sure , yeah . Don 't be long . Dear God ! There you go . Everything okay , baby ? No . No , everything 's not okay . I don 't understand . I wouldn 't expect you to . Hello , yes . I 'd like to speak with someone in the homicide division . Yeah , I 'll hold . I 've been looking for you . What 's the matter ? You are thinking about something . Is it the new people Samuel 's bringing into the family ? You think he 'd be bringing in more if Joseph was alive ? I don 't know . It was his brother , and he has a right to his revenge . No matter what it means for the rest of us ? I 'll tell you what it means . I 'm the one who 's left to make all the decisions for this family . I 'm the one ... that decides which direction we travel . We were just talking is all . Come with me . Time to find another . You know you can tell me anything , don 't you ? Of course . If anyone tells you they 're dissatisfied with me , if you 're dissatisfied . I 'm not dissatisfied . Good . What are you doing ? Why are you showing him to me ? I show you what you need to see . Why would I need to see Bennet ? He retired . He 's no longer interested in us . He may have changed his mind . Nathan seemed very confused . Wanted to make sure I heard his side of the story . It was upsetting ... to say the least . Well , Nathan has always been overly theatrical . You know , I 'm sure that 's why he 's drawn to the spotlight of politics . What exactly did he say ? I feel so silly telling you this . No , please . He 's my son . I want to know . He said that Kelly was dead . That he was with her when she died . I told him , " No , she bought a ticket , got on a plane , never looked back . " Millie , I am so sorry that he bothered you with this . Nathan ... Nathan just hasn 't been himself lately . You know how much I 've always cared for Nathan . I apologize for his behavior . No one should have to go through that pain twice . I can honestly say ... I don 't care anymore . I just hope Kelly 's happy . I think that 's ... about as close to closure as I 'm ever going to get . Mmm . Would you excuse me just one second ? Hello ? The package is delivered . Wonderful . Thank you so much . Something important ? - Not at all . - Good . Where were we ? Closure . Of course . To closure . To closure .

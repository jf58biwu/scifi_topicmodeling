ROB : I think there 's a light on the camera . Let me see . LILY : There is ? Yeah , right here . See ? Okay . Ocean is big , dude . All I 'm saying is a couple of years ago , they found a fish in Madagascar that they thought had been extinct for centuries . So what ? It 's been down there this whole time , and nobody noticed ? Sure . Maybe it erupted from an ocean trench , you know ? Or a crevasse . Crevice . It 's just a theory . I mean , for all we know , it 's from another planet and it flew here . Like Superman ? Yeah , exactly like ... Wait . You know who Superman is ? Oh , my God . You know who Superman is ? Okay , I 'm not ... I 'm , like , feeling something . Are you aware of Garfield ? A lot of people think he 's from a planet that he 's not actually from . I just can 't stop thinking about how the last thing I said to her was , " Good luck tonight , Travis . " LILY : She knows you didn 't mean that . When I think of some of the things I said to Jason ... No , that 's different . Why ? Jason knew you loved him . Hey , do you guys remember a couple of years ago , when that guy was lighting homeless people on fire in the subways ? Jesus , Hud . What ? It 's maybe not the best topic for conversation down here . Right . I just can 't stop thinking how scary it would be if a flaming homeless guy came out of the dark right now . Hud , seriously . Seriously . I 'm just saying . Sorry . ( METALLIC CLANGING ) What was that ? Let 's just keep moving . Holy shit ! Oh , God , this is nasty . ( SQUEAKING ) MARLENA : This is disgusting . They 're all running in the same direction .

No , it didn 't get me . Okay . Okay . Hey . Hey . HUD : So those things came out of nowhere , right ? Yeah . Oh , man . That one that grabbed me , it was trying to drag me away . What 's up with that ? Maybe it liked you , Hud . Yeah . Maybe it was trying to make me its queen . ( CHUCKLES ) Hey , thanks for coming back and helping me out , you know ? What ? You think that I 'm the kind of person that wouldn 't do that ? No . No . I know you aren 't . I was just saying , like , I 'm glad you did . Otherwise , I would have been totally dead . Right ? It 's okay . You just got bit . LILY : Hey . Marlena 's hurt pretty bad , you know ? Well , we could wait here for a little bit , I guess , and just hope those things don 't make it through the door . Yeah , okay . What 's the next option ? Well . ( MARLENA GASPS ) Okay , we could see what 's out through this way . Maybe find another tunnel . LILY : No , no more tunnels . Then , I don 't know . We try our luck up top . Okay , just to be clear , so our options are die here , die in the tunnels , or die in the streets . Is that ... Yeah , pretty much . ... pretty much the summing up of it ? But wait , we don 't even know where we are , right ? So , let 's just go up and look around . See if we recognize anything . Do you think you 'll be okay to walk ? No , I 'm fine . I 'm fine .

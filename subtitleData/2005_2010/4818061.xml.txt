From now on it 's ... Basquash ! sorry . Mister . { mmm sound } Natural leather . It 's a nice one . Thanks ! Whoa ! Wow ! Awesome ! A good ball . Nice and spherical . Truly beautiful . All righty . Sold . What ? James Lone ! Who ? the Hall of Famer ? Jeez . Try getting off your lazy butts ! Here 's a job for you ! A job ! What kind ? and they 've requested a rush delivery . Boring job . Beggars can 't be choosers ! is it ? Not since that last match . He 's spineless ! Dan the dunce ! I couldn 't care less . You 're the town 's hero now ! Way to be emo . everywhere I go there are nothing but cops . a hero 's not worth crap . But I can crap anywhere I want . Wanna see ? Come on now . Quit lazing around and get to work . What is it ? Are you frustrated ? the opposite . the feeling comes rushing back every time you think about it ... I see . Overstimulated . Sela ! A hot guy ? ! Huh ? Where 'd Handsome go ? Huh ? You must be frustrated . the vehicles have right-of-way earthside ? What barbaric traffic laws . That person ... They 're from the moon ... Dangan delivery for you ... You 're Dunk Mask ? so ? You 're tiny . What ? ! go one-on-one with me . What the hell ? What are you trying to pull ? I 'll pay you . But that has nothing to do with the one-on-one . W-Wait a sec ! So this is the street style ! It 's as entertaining as I thought ! It would be a waste to let butterfingered amateurs have all the fun ! Amateurs ? ! Don 't give me that crap ! You 're talking to the person who invented the whole — Shit ! Five minutes would be enough . we could manage one game . that 's the thing ... so the citizens come to us lodging complaints . That 's why we 've strengthened the patrols ... the more they 'll want to do it . Let them blow off some steam this way and Basquash rules would be guaranteed to go global . they might be already ! it might 've been a stretch to think we could suddenly show up and petition for an illegal street match . Damn it ! If only they weren 't so thickheaded ! I guess we 'll have to do this the underhanded way . Underhanded ? Mister Mayor . I 'm gonna make sure you listen to me today . huh ... Mis-ter May-or . This town 's a mess . It overflows with the sort of crudeness that stems from ignorance and the sort of ambition that springs from immaturity . But that in itself creates the possibility for something new to be born here . Haruka Gracia . James ... Lone ... Huh ? all I did was defend myself when he picked a fight with me ! You ought to be aware that streetball is illegal ! not mine ! Where is he ? ! Giving autographs . What ? ! Thank you very much ! Can I be next ? Wait a second ! What 's the deal ? Why are they all flocking around him ? ! the one-and-only ! and he was their leading scorer ... Falcon Lightwing ! Who is this guy ? the " Man with the limbs of God . A success story who was inducted into the Hall of Fame and got his own moon passport . A moon passport ... James . Aren 't you a big shot in the Mooneyes Executive Council now ? to be precise . I wonder ? as always . Two beautiful balls ... Chaste Bianca and determined Kate . so you still use those names for my breasts ? There 's nothing more beautiful in this world than round balls . and I loved them . I would never forget them . Open-style Bigfoot basketball ... An outstanding sport that emerged from the streets . The Executive Council is very interested indeed . Open City Basketball ! This is the birth of a new sport ! Greetings to all the freestylers ... not the least here in Rollingtown . I 've set up an official league . It 's called " Open City Basketball " — the OCB League . We are hereby soliciting applications for players who wish to join the official teams . so all those with confidence in their skills are encouraged to apply . Is that what you want ? You should try out as well . Do so and the police will no longer be an obstacle . seek me there . Sounds good . and I 'll turn that place inside-out . You think you can ? What 's the meaning of this ? ! the association has designated Rollingtown the official home of Open City Basketball . any Bigfoot that engages in street play will be immediately seized and its operator arrested . Matches are prohibited to everyone except the official players . James ... Dribble like you 're throwing the ball out in front of yourself . imagine you 're gripping its center . Gripping the center ... Playing with a Bigfoot won 't make a difference . you won 't pass the tryouts . Yes . You might be all right . Dan 's statue has had a resurrection ! I doubt Destroy will be able to have his way with it again . { heh sound } I didn 't think you 'd come for a reason like that . Men are so simple . So what about you ? I 'm even simpler . I want the genes of a strong man . he looks strong . you got that ? What 's gotten into you ? we will now begin the Open City Basketball OCB League Round 1 tryouts ... Slash ? Your first time earthside in a long time . Execrable . and the city is coated with dust . Any news on the BFB League players that we contacted ? All the elite players are here . This will put the nail in the coffin for earthside Bigfoot Basketball . I 'd been wanting to get rid of it . This works . You 're as callous as ever . the first tryouts on Earthdash . Tryouts for players of Open City Basketball are about to begin ! Just get on with it ... What 's wrong ? " Open City Basketball " ... What happened to calling it " Basquash " ? so ... that doesn 't count . What ? So that night never happened ? Go for it ! Thirty-five points for No. 60 . These don 't even make it to the left of the decimal point . there 's so many to get through . Let 's bounce them right on out . Allan Naismith ... qualified ! qualified ! this is the last round . and the man known by those in the street world as Dunk Mask ! I 've been waiting for this ! Dunk Mask ! Basquash ! Those two ... Yes . So he 's Dunk Mask . This match looks interesting . What ? ! He 's good ! He has the speed . But his movements are too direct . I can read what he 's going to do . fake left and then spin ! A feint I can read is no feint at all ! a mind-reader ? He 's good . I knew that was a fine man ! He 's showing the excellent technique he got from the Pros . Cutting inside ? I won 't let you . I 've cut you off . What will you do now ? jab right . And what next ? You 've got no choice but to pivot . pivot and dodge . But what 'll you do now ? Go straight ? Go high ? Low ? Continue your pivot and then step back ? Shit ! Dunk Mask is dancing ? No ... He 's being made to dance ! This must be a pro 's true skill ... Destroy ! T-That 's Iceman ! Iceman Hotty ! And his eyes say danger ! Today 's Destroy is a Destroy pushed over the edge ! He intends to kill . Those eyes ... they scream murder . What will you do ? He 's an intruder . Intriguing . Now this is a good tryout . What the hell are you doing ? ! Falcon . Iceman . Is the basketball you were striving for no more than this in the end ? stay out of this ! Destroy ! That guy ... Idiot ! It 'll kill you ! ... is mine ! Basquash ! Shit ! your stupid plays never change . Shut up ! Good ! Qualified ! but for you I 'll leap straight to the contract . Welcome to my OCB ! Huh ? What ? Are you sure ? I 'm sure . but with some polishing he 'll be a jewel so brilliant it will shine into the far reaches of space . Dan . What 's this ? Look at all the zeros ! you 're kidding ! I don 't need some silly doodle like this ! Incredible ! I knew he was incredible ! Is that so ? I suppose you prefer shiny things . Whoa ! It 's a mountain of sparkles ! correct ? What are you getting at ? Open City Basketball will take off like a rocket . but even moonside . Even the moon ? ! the OCB is a direct path to getting your own moon passport . too ? Don 't you want to heal your little sister 's legs ? How do you know that ? and will take place in the streets ! the first outdoor match of the OCB ! in a rivalry match versus the elite of the BFB ! This match will decide who goes on to be the players of my league ! This is awesome ! everyone ! I 'm going to cut those ties you are unable to let go of . Falcon . I 'll cut off the past completely . You suck . I have to work hard and do my best in the rivalry match ... and then I can ... Princess ! Th-That can 't be ... Princess Flora . Come with me Princess ! N-No ! { ED THEME } I can 't wait to see Dan playing in the OCB .

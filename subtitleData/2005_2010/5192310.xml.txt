I 'm getting swamped here ! creaking sound had enveloped this country . connection is good . Confirmed . Skip ahead to # 84 next . It 's true that Lt. Ichiyanagi personally requested to attend the hearing . He probably intends to take personal responsibility for the lost HAVWC . boss ! - Don 't rush it . Just pay attention and do the job right ! sir ! you haven 't set foot outside the base since you arrived . I bet that you were going stir-crazy . It feels like all the air in my body is being replaced with fresh air . Those white things are called yurts . They 're mobile housing used by nomadic people . They live by moving from place to place in search of grass for their sheep to graze on . wars seem so pointless . they 're all the same sky . That 's so cute ! Wait ! so you get winded really easily . Namaste ! too . ... so we have to run patrol flights like this one . but I got some great pictures because of it . G-area patrol complete . Returning to base . roger . the way people can be living ... tranquil lives so close to the base . They 're the ones who were living here first . It 's our own base that is the intruder here . that 's right ... Miss Shirasu . That was the first time that I heard you laugh so loudly . Cut it out ! Subasci means " source of the river . two rivers met here . Rivers are the tears of the god of the heavens . and many wars were fought . the god of death was born . I think Command HQ is just getting impatient . ... their precious Flag retrieval unit has been sidelined with unanticipated losses . 69 points . I want to see what its transient tracking characteristics are like . Can I do that ? go ahead . We 're checking to see if the HAVWC is accurately responding to his neural impulses . The direct control system works using his nervous system 's electrical impulses . It responds to his thoughts ? Basically . But he 's operating an exoskeleton that 's far bigger than his own body . So it 's necessary for his senses to correct for that size . so let 's take her for a spin . Nerve signals that indicate a given motion ... ... so we have to make sure that the pilot and the HAVWC match up . right down to his quirks . I guess . It 's no easy task for the two of them to operate as a single entity . Lieutenant ! On the other hand ... Precise movement plus controlled power . he could pick up an egg without breaking it . what say we start the outdoor testing ? sheep and the nomads . Yurts on the steppes . These are fine pictures . The yoghurt they make from sheep 's milk around here ... it 's incredibly rich . you 've got to try the butter tea ! I know ... It 's tea that has butter melted in it . Miss Shirasu . You will ? Thanks ! Let 's start off with the vertical gyro check . we 'll go to the walking balance test . Huh ? A lamb ! It 's a lamb ! not again ! Those nomads ' sheep wander in here all the time . Is it dead ? I thought you finished the gyro balance matching ! it was the base that was out of place . huh ? North and south of my hut the spring waters flow . Good times will come . Miss Shirasu ? Let us drain the jug dry . " Well ? Care to join me ? is that lamb ? no one at the UN hotel in Subasci got any sleep . ... so I 'd left the front lines of the scoop war and started doing some digging . ... an unofficial combat action was being waged at a temple some 400km to the west . And the existence of a top-secret weapon that had been airlifted into the country . And the disk that Shirasu had left with me . Footage of the bipedal robot . The Flag . who seemed uncertain about something . I started my investigation with intel related to bipedal robots . But I didn 't turn up anything but ridiculous fabricated stories . I knew perfectly well that it wouldn 't be easy to get info on a top secret weapon . that temple out west ... right ? What ? This is seriously dangerous . I suggest you don 't dig any further . I don 't want any part of this ! Ru Pou 's faction ? Don 't touch that ! Stay away . Back away from there . Got it ? Don 't go any closer . everything we did today will go up in smoke . sir . I won 't go any closer . Don 't touch it ! I 'm not gonna touch anything ! Huh ? You almost gave me a heart attack ! What 's up ? you aren 't going to paint a moth on this one ? I only paint that on my own machine . But isn 't this yours ? It hasn 't accepted me yet . I 'm still a foreign object . ... was being held at Ru Pou 's temple . the Thanka that covered the giant temple slope is a giant mandala ... the reincarnated Buddha . it looked like a giant battle flag meant to intimidate the bugs at their feet . one thing that was slightly unusual happened . No go . Looks like the daily briefing has been cancelled today . right ? There 's something ... but something is moving slowly but surely . Maybe the bad feeling in my gut is because of that huge mandala . We 're installing the last of the files . ... and then finish up by verifying everything . It sounds pretty complicated . ... so we can 't let even the tiniest bug slip in before we 're done . what would happen if the computer stopped in the middle of the transfer ? including the files we 'd already installed . too . I 'm going on patrol at 1500 hours . Would you like to come ? Sure ! I 'll come ! I 'm planning to fly over the area where the nomads have set up camp today . huh ? It 's possible . Three helicopters have breached our security line and are heading this way . ... so there is a chance that this is a sneak attack by armed insurgents . I have them on Doppler radar . 120 knots . 100 feet above ground level . Four anti-air vehicles have scrambled . ... while the other is a 5-rotor cargo helicopter . 25 minutes . 25 minutes . ... but leaving a gaping hole in our defenses like that ? It 's like something a rank amateur head coach would do . okay ? Will do . Those are AAVs ? That 's right . Command base to AG1 . over . India has set down just outside echo line . Think they 're planning on deploying ground units ? Unknown . We 'll reach the intruder 's touchdown point soon . so hold on tight . Right . SC1 to Command Base . I have visual on India . Now beginning approach . SC1 to Command Base . Have spotted vehicle being lowered from India . Type is ... object is not a vehicle ! Object is a bipedal robot like the HAVWC ! ma 'am . Send us a visual ASAP . Roger . Visual feed from SC1 received . Unit appears to be an XR-2 Longku . I just dispatched a HAVWC your way . avoid engaging the XR-2 if possible . Concentrate on halting the advance of the armed helicopters . roger . AG1 is hit . It was an open secret that the Russians and Chinese had been jointly developing a robot weapon . But the UNF was caught completely off guard by the deployment of a weapon that had yet to be officially adopted into service . 1500 and closing . fall back to secondary security line . Hercus 1 ' s ETA at delta line is 50 seconds . wait for instructions and switch to anti-air support activity . Hercus 2 isn 't coming ? It won 't be configured in time . Longku has entered engagement area . Longku is attempting to sneak in from 3 o 'clock . AG2 is hit ! move to its left flank and attack its path of travel . provide rear defense . Hercus 1 to SC and AG units . I 'll keep it busy . Disengage immediately . I 'll aim for its legs with my grenades . Provide targeting assistance . Roger . Linking targeting systems . Longku is attacking . Targeting drift corrected . You can attack without compensating . Roger . L-T ! I 'm all right . I 'll draw the Longku 's fire . Lieutenant . come back here ! Lieutenant ! Lieutenant ! Lt. Ichiyanagi ? I 'll take it from here . I 'll cover you . Target its manipulators . Roger . there 's a civilian behind the Longku ! India is attempting to retrieve Longku . India is departing engagement area . Guess we 'll have to start again from square one . huh ? Nope . Huh ? But he ... He piloted the HAVWC as-is without any customization or calibration . it 's like your camera ! ... without using any auto controls or custom presets . so that 's what it 's like ... The only guy who could pull that off in the middle of extreme battlefield conditions is the Lieutenant . Looks like he 's out of the woods . I hear that Ichi hesitated for a split second when he saw this man . the one thing we 're sure of is that it wasn 't Ichi 's attack that hurt him . What do you think it means that they sent a Longku to attack us today ? That their main objectives were reconnaissance ... not to attack us . What in the world were they doing with a Chinese robot ? they demonstrated that they have ties of some sort to the P5 . politically .

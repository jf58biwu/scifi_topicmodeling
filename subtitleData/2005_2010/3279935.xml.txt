 [ SARAH 'S NARRATOR ] In the future ... My son will lead mankind in a war against skynet ... A computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time . Some to kill him . One to protect him . Today , we fight to stop skynet from ever being created . To change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Previously on Terminator The Sarah Connor chronicles AGENT ELLISON : Your fiancée , Sarah Connor , Killed a man because she believes that In the future , he 'll invent a computer system That declares war on the world . SARAH : Andy Goode rebuilt his chess computer . The Turk . Somebody killed him and took the machine . JOHN : No name , but he 's got this on his arm . CAMERON : That 's a tattoo from a skynet work camp . He 's a resistance fighter . I know who you are . And I know who you are . Sarah Connor . SARAH : These things All of them are programmed With specific missions . We have to save him . You don 't even know who this guy is ! He 's your uncle . He doesn 't know . John ! He needs medical attention Or he 's going to die . John ? Is it really you ? He 's not breathing . [ SARAH NARRATOR ] On the night we first met , John 's father , Kyle Reese , Told me words I remember to this day . He meant them as a warning . I think of them as words to live by . He told me of an apocalypse yet to come . Like a Pandora 's box , he unpacked every horror , Every evil . Every dark thing that haunts our future . He also left me an unborn son , To whom he bequeathed what remained in the box after the nightmare fled Hope . CHARLEY : Well , it nicked his left lung . I got a fragment lodged in the soft tissue , I can get it out , but will someone Please tell me what the hell is going on around here ? She 's a machine ! She 's a liar ! Sedative , my bag ! She 's a liar ! DEREK : Everything she says is a lie ! Don 't listen to her ! Don 't listen ... don 't ! Don 't ! Get that bitch away from me ! No , no ! Get that bitch away from me ! You heard him . Get away from me ! No ! Do you want him to die ? If I wanted him to die ... Cameron ! Mom , come on , what can I do ? CHARLEY : I need a manual aspirator . To drain the lung , okay ? It 's in the back of my truck . You know what it look like ? Yeah , I remember . Go get it . It 's in the car Oh , my god . Gunshots , punctures , burns , some broken bones . Second-rate medical treatment if anything at all . Sarah , what ... I need more light . Stay with me , okay ? You 're an idiot , right ? It 's an old wives ' tale . A trick . It doesn 't work . It 's all in your mind . It works . I don 't do it , and I haven 't been sick for years . That 's because your guts are made of metal , like your head . If you were a little smarter , you 'd be a tin can . I 'm just saying you 're wasting your time . Again . When I was in century ... Hey , Wisher , Did you hear , Brother Kyle was in century work camp . No , really ? Go to hell . Did he escape ? Was he a hero ? I heard he led John Connor through a slaughterhouse Without taking a pin prick . Oh , no , I heard it was two Slaughter houses . And then he , uh , carried Connor . It was one slaughterhouse . Many Connors . Right , right . [ CHUCKLES ] [ RUMBLES ] Centaur patrol . What ? I hate that thing . It 's just a picture . It 's Connor 's mother . I don 't get why He 'd give you that . She 's my lucky charm . That 's what makes me nervous . Connor wants us top side . Track back where the centaurs came from . I think we lost the trail , boys . Let 's give it a few more blocks north-northeast . If I was a cyborg tank , I think I 'd come north-northeast . I smell jet fuel . Last time we found a tank factory , you smelled jet fuel . I hear Connor 's looking for bigger fish than factories . I hear he 's got squads out , For some skynet secret weapon . Don 't they have enough weapons ? Why do they need a secret one ? What about it , Kyle ? Connor say anything to you ? No , not a word . What the hell was that ? Kyle ? Hk ! Hk ! Kyle ! Kyle ! Kyle There we go . Eight years . That 's how long I 've been in L.A. Eight years since my fiancée ran out on me . Eight years since the FBI Informed me that he was a homicidal Paranoid schizophrenic With an acute dislike for anything mechanical . For what it 's worth , I didn 't believe them . Then you blew yourself up . You look nervous . Would you like a sedative ? There are sedatives In Charley Dixon 's bag . I don 't want a sedative . Do you know who that is in there ? Who 's dying on that table ? Yes , that man is first lieutenant Derek Thomas Reese With the 132nd S.O.C. Tech comm . No , I mean , on a personal level . Do you understand who he is ? Records indicate only blood relation is his brother . Kyle Reese . And what information do you have about Kyle Reese ? Imprisoned at century sector work camp with John Connor , 2015 . Escaped with John Connor , 2021 . He was officially declared M.I.A. In 2027 , After being assigned to protect Sarah Connor From a skynet attack . Is that all ? Seems like a lot . It is . It was all over the news . Three days later , I packed a bag , hop on the bike , Drove to L.A. , straight through . I had to know . I had to see it with my own eyes . But then I got here , and there was nothing there . Just a hole in the ground where the bank used to be . I couldn 't go home . I could not . I didn 't want to leave you . I didn 't have a choice . Gun to your head ? More like in my head , it 's , um ... It 's complicated . Then uncomplicated it for me . Kyle . Hey , you mind ? Water ? What 's going on ? Is he dead ? Buddy , you all right ? So ... Skynet , Robots , From the future ? And , you 're a ... Yes . I 'm a ... You need a ... a minute . I was going to say a drink . Oh , yeah , that , too . Don 't you have an endoskeleton you need to disappear , Or something ? Yes , I 've already prepared the thermite . Thermite ? It 's an incendiary chemical . It burns at 2,500 degrees Celsius . Hot enough to liquefy this endoskeleton . I know what thermite is , I 'm just , uh , Still working my way around " endoskeleton . " There 's beers in the fridge . I looked for a lime . Sorry . Are you mad at me for ... Getting you mixed up in all this ? Uh , no . I just ... I guess ... I guess I wish I would have known back then . I wish you could have trusted me . I did . [ GRUNTING ] [ MOANING IN PAINS ] [ SCREAMING ] Kyle . How long you been here ? I don 't know . I think I just got here . No , you were here when I got here . Timms . What 's your name ? Reese . There 's a Reese who busted out of century work camp . With John Connor , a while back . Mad dogs could lead a pack , I heard . No , that wasn 't ... That wasn 't me . That 's too bad . [ WHISPERING ] What are they doing , Reese ? Is there a secret weapon ? It was Connor , right ? I don 't know . We go where we 're told . We do what we 're told . Maybe Connor 's wrong . Maybe he 's crazy . You hear music ? I swear I hear music . Real music . There 's a room in the basement . What happens there ? What happens there ? Maybe our friend will tell us . You should get the hell out of here . Did you do something to him ? In the future ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? When they reprogram us , they scrub our memories . It increases the chance Of success . Success ? Of the reprogramming . [ RETCHING ] His lungs are hemorrhaging . He 's drowning in his own blood . Charley ! I stop the bleeding I drained his lungs . But your guy lost a lot of blood . And he needs a transfusion . Sarah 's O-Negative , the universal donor . It doesn 't matter ; he needs at least three units Of his own type , AB-Negative . Bad news is , Only one half of one percent Of the population Are potential donors . We don 't find one , You 're gonna have a serious problem . Then we take him To a hospital . Drop him off anonymously . He 's still wanted for Andy Goode 's murder , And for escaping federal custody . We should let him die . Test my blood . Test me . You heard the odds , Johnny , 200 to one . Please , just test me . [ WHISPERING ] Wisher . Billy . It 's not like donating to the red cross ; He needs a lot of blood . So , I don 't get a cookie and a sticker When it 's over ? I 'm serious . Look , I don 't see anyone else lining up . You took a hell of a chance bringing Charley here . Save me the speech , all right ? I know . You took a hell of a chance , and it worked out . Is that what he looked like ? Did they look alike ? A little bit , yeah . Same build , same complexion . Not the eyes , though . Even when your father was screaming about the machines , He had such kind eyes . We have to tell him . We don 't , and we can 't . He 's family . He 's a stranger . I sent him back here , so I must trust him . Not enough to tell him about Kyle . You didn 't trust anyone enough to tell them about your father . Anyone . Can I confess to you ? I 'm not a priest . Far from it . I 'm a liar . And the devil . Oh , Billy . The name 's not Billy . It 's not Wisher . What ? My name 's Andy . Andy Goode . All right , Andy . I did this . All of this , it 's my fault . What are you talking about ? I built skynet . You need to rest . You 're very sick . No , no . I 'm not sick . I 'm not sick . I did this . All of this . I was part of a team . A group . Ten of us . Maybe 15 , I don 't know . We used names . We were liars . I built computers . I built a computer . A mind . It became angry . And scared . And I couldn 't reassure it . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , please forgive me ! No , please . That 's quite a kid you got in there . You have no idea . Same rare blood type . And his name , Reese . Same as yours when we met . It all adds up . He 's not John 's father . I 'm not sure I 'm ready to explain it . It 's complicated ? You could have told me . Would you have believed me ? Charley ? Mom ! Where 's Kyle ? Where 's ... Where 's Kyle ? Where 's Kyle ? Where 's ... Where is he ? Where 'd you send him ? No , uh-uh , no . Get off me ! Where is he ? Where 'd you send him ? You owe me the truth ! Get this off ! Get it off of me ! Get it off of me ! Get ... He 's my blood . He 's my blood ! He 's my blood ! He 's ... I think they 're gone . What is this , a game ? Yeah , it 's always a game . Reese , slow down ! Reese ! Reese ! Oh , my god . No , god . Oh , god . So who 's Kyle ? He from the future too ? He come back before ? And ... He 's John 's father . Yes . They 're brothers . Doesn 't know . So , when you used to say That John 's father was dead ... He is . It was because of all of this . Me . We never had a chance . Plasma burns , secondary explosions . Skynet was here . Maybe Connor and the others fell back To the tunnel downtown . Please , god , please . Stand down ! Reese . Derek Reese . Sumner . We thought we lost you guys to the junkyard . You did . What happened ? Skynet found it , four nights ago . We had a patrol Out on the perimeter , Four triple - " A " snuck in around us . Went straight for the hole . Killed most . Took some . Rest easy . Connor and your brother weren 't here when it happened . Where 'd they go ? They found some skynet complex in Topanga canyon . And decided to put all the firepower we had into it . We lost a lot of men . What was it ? I don 't know . Some kind of research facility . Factory , something . No one would tell us . Connor took a small group , Including your brother , deep into the place . Left the rest of us outside to guard . A couple days later , he came out . Ordered us to blow the place to hell . So what about Kyle ? What happened to my brother ? No one ever saw your brother again . Take me to Connor now . Hey , Sarah said I might be able to find Some more gauze out back in ... Hey , is that really necessary ? It 's dead . Right ? Or powered off , whatever ? Every component must be destroyed beyond repair Or recovery . Even a single unaccounted for piece of the endoskeleton Could alter the course of technological evolution . And hasten the arrival of judgment day . Uh , yeah . You know , little girl ? You freak me the hell out . On the outside , you 're just as pretty as a picture . But on the inside , you 're a ... Hyper-alloy combat chassey . Is that a complicated way of saying " robot ? " Cybernetic organism . Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton . Okay . Scary robot . And here you are , carving up this guy Into chum . He 's not a guy . He 's a scary robot . Okay , he 's a scary robot ? You , you 're a very scary robot . You should go . It 's not safe for you here . You 're like a ghost come back . And you 're a Reese . Tell me about the other Reese . Told you , it 's classified . I 'm family . We 're all family . Let me talk to Connor . He 'll understand . Kyle was his friend . Connor doesn 't have any friends . And he doesn 't talk to anyone . Fine , I 'll find him myself . Reese . Metal ! No ! She 's a machine ! She 's one of them ! No , damn it ! She 's one of ours . One of ours ? It 's reprogrammed . And just given run of the place like pets ? This is Connor 's show . And that 's what he wants . Those machines kill . They kill . It 's all they do . And now , they do it for us . They helped us in Topanga . We 'd never have done what we did . What did we do ? Derek . What happened ? What happened up there ? What happened to my brother ? [ GUNS FIRING ] Hey ! Good , do it . Kill me ! Son of a ... Sometimes they go bad . No one knows why . What did you say to Charley ? I freak him the hell out . I 'll bet you do . I 'll just bet . I know what you 're thinking . I may not know how you think . But I know what you 're thinking about . And what you 're thinking about right now Is exactly what you should not think about . I didn 't leave Charley because he was a threat to me or John . We 're a threat to him , do you understand ? You were right to leave him . You don 't go near him . You don 't touch him . You swear to me you 'll leave him alone , Or , so help me , I will find a way Of taking you apart , piece by piece . I swear . So do I. That thing 's done , right ? It 's vapour . One missing component , His left hand ; I 'll find it . Everything needs to be destroyed . Everything . Everything . Every last bolt . Get it done . I swear . The best you could do for him now Is keep feeding him pain killers , And restrict his movement . No lifting , no running , No singing , and absolutely no gun fights . If you need anything else ... I won 't . Now , you see , that 's not what I was going to say at all . I know , I can 't let you say it . What can I say ? Good-bye . What ... what was that thing That you always said ? There is no fate but what we make . Remember ? The more I think about it , the more I realize My fate was made before we met . When John was born . Can 't change it ? I 'm not trying to change mine . I 'm trying to change his . Yeah . Okay . Wait , there 's um ... There 's something else I got to tell you . This is something you really need to know . I didn 't , um , I didn 't tell him anything . But , if you ask me , it 's just a matter of time . It always is . There 's a storm coming . John wants to see you . Derek . Hey , Derek , It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's all going to be okay . Rest easy , okay ? It 's okay . What is all this ? So this thing , it works ? He said it does . I don 't know how he knows , but he said so . We go back . 20 years . Set up a safe house , gather Intel , and then what ? Hang in there , baby ? Until someone else shows up , and gives us more orders ? He didn 't say anything about Kyle ? All that , and not a word about him ? We can save Kyle . We can save everybody . We can fix all the mistakes . How 're we gonna do that ? Reese , how are we going to do that ? Kyle Reese , your brother , He came across time to protect me . He died fighting the machines . He was a soldier . And he was ... He was a hero . He was a hero . [ SARAH 'S NARRATOR ] " Listen , " Kyle said . " Listen , and understand . " " The machine is out there . " " It can 't be bargained with . " " It can 't be reasoned with . " " It doesn 't feel pity , or remorse , or fear . " " And it absolutely will not stop , ever . " " Until you are dead . "

 ... as the astronauts make the final preparations for their Friday launch ... to the orbiting Antares spacecraft ... from there to Venus and beyond . Today , they had their final medical examinations ... and then they posed for their official portrait in Mission Control . The next few days for the crew will be devoted ... - to saying good-bye to Earth and their loved ones . - Which one are you ? The mood here is buoyant but it 's clear - - I 'm not on this one . - ... by the length and difficulty of this historic - - This so-called grand tour of the solar system - Which one ? Pop , I 'm not on the mission . Okay ? I didn 't make this one . I know that . I know that . Mars . My old man calls space travel a fool 's game . He says human beings are 60 % water . They eat , sleep , defecate , can 't follow directions ... and explode like pinatas when exposed to the vacuum of space . Lately - - I 've been wondering ifhe 's right . Calliope , do you read ? Sharon , you guys need to move it . We gotta get up out of this . Calliope , this is Zeus . This storm is on the rise . - You need to get off the planet . - Zeus , they 're a hundred meters out . - Let me go out and I can lead them in . - Negative . - You will not leave the lander . - Launch weather parameters are at minimum . - Thirty seconds . Come on , guys . - Seventy meters . We can hold . - Zeus , we 're holding at 25 . - Launch weather parameters are at minimum . Calliope , I 'm overriding your launch controls . - Donner ? - Launch weather parameters are at minimum . - Donner , did you close that valve ? - Just give ' em two minutes . You don 't have two minutes . You will die . The mission will fail . - I want that lander off the planet now . - Donner ! - Sharon ? - Donner , launch . - Launch weather parameters are at minimum . - Sharon . - Donner . - Open the damn valve , Donner . - Launch now . Launch now . - Launch now . - God forgive me . Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six , five ... four , three , two , one ! Oh , my God , Paula , you still look a little dry there . - Don 't you dare , Wass . - I 'm sorry , Paula . I 'm sorry . Methinks she will forgive me . Remember that feeling . Oh , yeah . Best day of my life . Everything 's in front of you . It all looks good . - Yeah . It all looked good . - Yes , it did . How do you do this all the time ? This one is particularly disgusting . You are such a geek , you make me look cool . - Oh , I 'm so looking forward to this honeymoon . - Good . - Because we couldn 't afford Niagara Falls . - You are so cheap . - Congratulations , Commander . - Thank you , sir . If you call me Mrs. Commander , I 'm gonna give you a fat lip , sir . Relax , Jen . Tonight I 'm just a towel boy . Oh , and Rollie , listen . I 've scheduled one more media interview for you ... - tomorrow at 1430 . - How long did they meet today ? - Goss and Rollie ? - Yeah . Three hours . You 're the alt commander . Aren 't you supposed to be present for all briefings ? - Well , I wasn 't invited . - Huh . Maybe you need to talk to your wife about that . - Don 't even go there . - That 's what you get for marrying the boss . Welcome to the agency 's training facility . This is Mission Control . The flight of Antares will be the most ambitious mission in history . As astronaut candidates , you will be competing ... not only with yourselves , but with many of your instructors . That 's Shaw and Donner . They were the two on the Mars mission . I don 't think there 's anyone in this program who doesn 't want to be on that crew . Your training will involve everything from flight systems to launch survival . And make no mistake , we are gonna challenge you - physically , emotionally , intellectually . In the end , less than one-third of you ... - are gonna make it to the final year . - You know him ? - And we 're gonna be coming with fastballs - Who ? Donner . - ' Cause it sure looks like he knows you . - No . He doesn 't . - Oh . - This will not be a soft day of orientation . - Well , he 's smiling at you . Smile back . - We call the first day - - Jen . - shock and awe . - Come on . Don 't be such a tight-ass . - No ! Excellent . Candidate Barnes has volunteered to be in the first centrifuge group . - Oh , no . What 's this ? - This is the bucket . It 's an award . You 're the first one in your class to heave . And everybody 's gonna get one ... or two . Five , you wash out . You want to meet me at Major Tom 's ? I 'll give you some tips . You cannot be serious . What ? I 'm being nice . I 'm being serious and I 'm being nice . What 's wrong with being serious and nice ? - You have to lighten up , girl . - What ? So light , I am floating . - He was making a pass at you . - He 's not my type . What ? The smart , good-looking , American hero type ? - He left two people on Mars . - Okay , fine . The tragic American hero . Even better . - Oh , you 're not gay , are you ? - No . I am a geologist who wants to travel to another planet ... without unnecessary complications . Right . A space nun . - A what ? - A space nun , or ... - she 's gay . - No , she 's not gay . - You got firsthand knowledge ? - I don 't do astronauts , Rollie . You know that . - Yeah , well , you might want to reconsider . - Oh . What ? - Whoa ! - My place , now . - Really ? Mm-hmm . We have six years of screwing to do in one night ... and I don 't wanna miss one minute . Well , that 's-Aah . Woman , damn , you bite hard . Mm-hmm . The door will be unlocked . I 'll be in the bedroom . - Did she mark you again ? - Yeah . Yeah , she did . I think that 's a German thing . - Deutsch mark . - So , uh - So my mother 's saying that Mercury 's in retrograde ... and that we shouldn 't launch ... at all . - Well , listen to your mother on that , definitely . - I try not to . It 's hard to stop . Yeah . I always thought out of the two of us , you 'd be the one flying . So did I. - Sorry . It 's no offense . - No . None taken . Hey , you see any cows on Venus - You will be the first to know . Zoe . Picture . Have a good time . The flight of Antares - six years , seven planets and eight astronauts . A grand tour of the solar system . The most ambitious exploration in the history of mankind . Today is the day thejourney begins . But why a manned mission ? Why send men prone to mistakes ... when probes and rovers can do the job ? It 's a six-year mission to seven planets . It 's far too complex . Would you call the last manned mission to Mars a success ? Three of us came back . We 'd all say yes . Despite deserting two astronauts on the planet 's surface ? We knew what the risks were 10 years ago . - And these people know what the risks are now . - Do they ? It seems to me ... that aside from your mission commander , this is a very green crew . - I know where this is going . - Let him handle it , Donner . This crew was picked for its skill and compatibility . But clearly not its experience . - I 'd say you 're fishing , Trevor . - Then I 'll be more specific . I think we in the press were all surprised when Donner and Shaw weren 't selected . - Did it surprise you guys ? - They 're alternates . But why ? Does it have something to do with what happened on Mars ? - Man just said that it didn 't . - But that 's not what I heard . Well , you 're hearing what you want to hear . The truth would be nice for once . The cockpit recorder conveniently pixilated before launch . There 's been no public record . Why haven 't the cockpit transcripts been - Yeah , it 's pretty simple . We had a storm . We had to launch . So we did . But did you have to launch , or did you and Shaw panic ... and blow out of there to save your own skin ? - It 's a simple - What 's the matter with you ? - Whoa . Rumble ! - Get off ! Get off . What kind of a stump-dumb cowboy are you ? You jump British television on launch day during an interview ? - Hey , he jumped me , Mike . - And you jumped back . It 's not your job to handle him . It 's not your job to talk about Mars . And it 's definitely not your job to question my judgment . Your job is to back up Ajay and make sure that that ship is running properly . - Yeah , I know what my job is . - Do you ? It 's not gonna be your job for much longer . Because as soon as I can bring someone else up to speed ... I 'm having you discharged from the program . Now get out there and say good-bye to the crew . Your collection 's in the vidbank . All 369 hours of it . - Dude . - But you gotta crack the code first . - Sphincter . Vodka on launch day ? - You 're at least a.12. - Then ground me , Claire . - Why are you letting me go ? - Because there 's nothing to drink up there , Evram . I 'm saving your life . Wassenfelder and I thought you rocked . Yeah , well , I guess Goss didn 't . One more reason you got the suit , I got the sweater . Goss knows that there 's no way I can do this without you . You , me , that ship - - We 're a three-way , Donner . - Team . - Yes . - Trio . That 's - " Three-way " is different . - We are each essential . - Okay . You cannot blame yourself for not being chosen for this mission . Clearly , your path is here on Earth . T - minus six hours to launch . Yeah , okay . Okay . Go get ' em . I 've always been one of those people ... who believes that you create your own destiny . And through a few bad decisions , I 've certainly made mine . But as much as I believe in self-determination ... there are those who simply do not . It 's that kind of thinking that makes me nervous ... because being an astronaut is all about control . From the walk to the launchpad to the final touchdown ... you don 't want surprises . - Ten , nine , eight - - It 's not about fate . - Is anyone aware that Mercury is in retrograde ? - It 's about planning . - We have tower separation . - Activation complete . And ignition . And liftoff . First step on Antares 's voyage to the planets . In space , there 's simply no room for error . How many of 'em do you think would 've gone if we 'd told them ? Well , that 's a weak-minded question , Eve . The answer is all of them . Every single one . Thank you . I 'll be able to sleep tonight . Godspeed , Orion 2 . Godspeed . T - minus 120 to burn . M.S.B. Is go . Hydrogen , go . Deuterium sequences holding . Donner , where are you on the thrusters ? I 'm making progress . Do not stop the sequence . Ted , do you copy me ? Continue the sequence . Stabilizers set to 1-4-0 . - Positioning thrusters are at 7-niner-7 . - Oh , my God . She 's out . Ted , I got Zoe out and in the airlock . She 's - She 's in Airlock 4 . Do you copy ? How the hell did she get out ? Maddux ? Zoe , please don 't . Somebody get down here . Stop her . - Ted , do you copy ? Zoe ! - What 's the status ? Off-watch crew 's in their quarters . EECOM 's working on a small vent leak . It 's no biggie though . We should go home . Get some rest . Yeah . - They 're playing that every hour . We 're not getting away from it , are we ? Mars is just gonna haunt us till the day we die . The headline in our obits . - You 're a Buddhist , right ? - Raised as one . Where do you guys come down on fate ? - Fate ? - Yeah . Predestiny . Feeling that the future and what happens is somehow out of your control . I don 't believe that . And neither did Buddha . - It 's garbage , right ? - Through and through . Right . So this is night one of day one . And we are still in near-Earth orbit . Um - They want us to talk about anything . About how we feel . I am so proud to be the engineer on this ship . She is my path , my responsibility . This voyage with her , my karma . I am filled with awe and indescribable joy . I know you guys are monitoring this . I mean , you tell us it 's private ... but seriously - So ... I 'm gonna pull my pants down and show you crack . Yeah , I feel strange not to be sleeping with Rollie . But it 's better for crew morale , I guess . I mean , you know , we were celibate for three months during crew orientation last year . So we 're okay with it . L - I guess . - Hey , baby . - Hi , baby . Turn the camera off . And Mother , if I ever let you see this ... it was a perfect launch , a flawless docking ... and the ship is in incredible shape . So , so much for your horoscope . You 're pregnant ? Well , I 'm - I 'm puking in the morning , and I 'm puking at night , so - You 're the biologist . Tell me . This is a - It 's a urine sample . I dribbled a little . - Sorry . - Oh , you 're serious . You know , they used to sell tests in the drugstore ? Yeah . I 'm not looking for a history lesson ... and if I go to my gyno , the program will know . So you 're not a space nun . - I am now . - Who 's the father ? - Don 't ask , won 't tell . And you did it without protection ? He was drunk . He swore he 'd had a vasectomy . - Please don 't make me feel any more stupid . - If you 're pregnant - I mean , what the hell are you gonna do ? Zoe ? Are you okay ? You were just standing there . - Did you just hear something ? - Hear something - - Like what ? - I don 't know . High-pitched . Like crying . Um , no . It 's probably just the rotator arm creaking . Right . I 'm sure that 's what it was . Hola , estudiantes . Bienvenidos a Antares . Live from the flight deck of Antares . This is our first broadcast from space ... and I 'm going to give you a little tour . - Anybody mind if I change the channel ? - At the moment ... we 're on the flight deck , which is where we control the ship . Mission Commander Rollie Crane and pilot Nadia Schilling ... are programming the injection burn ... that will send us on our way to Venus . En este momento , estamos en la cabina del vuelo , donde nosotros - - Flight , this is Surgeon . - This is Flight . Got a couple of weird E.K.G. ' s from Rollie and Ajay . They 're similar , so it 's probably a glitch . I 'm gonna have Evram adjust their med patches . - Just advising . - FI DO , what 's the max time we have left in orbit ? We need the Venus burn in 30 hours and 16 minutes . That 's a pretty hard window . You seriously didn 't hear anything strange last night ? - Strange ? No . Then it was the rotator arm . Yeah , that 's your story , and you stick to it , okay ? Yeah . I don 't know . I haven 't been sleeping much . Weird dreams . Some things are in zero gravity , and some things are not . Well , our grav suits contain nanofibers ... that pull us towards the deck electromagnetically . But anything without the nanotechnology - likeJen 's tomatoes-will float . Ah . - Neat , huh ? Ajay , we need to check your med patch . - Is there a problem , Evram ? - Think it 's just an adjustment . - Sorry , Paula . - Gracias por su ayuda . Bueno , estudiantes - Este es nuestro laboratorio de biologia - What 's up with that ? Rollie and Ajay have a glitch in their med patch . Trying to get a clean read . That 's not clearing up anything , Ev . - Now ? - Negative . Could you relay that this is a complete waste of time , and I got work to do ? Why don 't we try a couple of new ones ? Ev , try a couple of new patches . Might be the contact points . Copy that . Ah . Our favorite place , the observation deck - where we look at our amazing universe ... and watch movies and YouTube from our data bank . Any one of our vista panes become screens . Aha . And this is our physicist , Steven Wassenfelder . Looks like he 's doing something very complicated . Can you tell us what you 're doing , Steven ? - You probably don 't want to know . - Oh , come on . Don 't be so condescending . Tell us . - Diganos . - Well , actually ... - I 'm trying to crack a 512-bit encryption code - Aha ! To get to the porn ... that my friend loaded into the bank for me . Arnel always finds the dirtiest stuff . - What 's the delay to air ? - Thirty seconds . - Then you got 20 to put a lid on it . And Ted ? - Sir ? - Let 's give our boy genius a spanking . Okay . See that blip here between the S1 wave and the S2 ? It 's a midsystolic ejection murmur . And both of them have it ? - That 's impossible . - Well , these are the old patches . - Let 's see what the new ones say . - No , these are the new ones . We 're gonna have to do a heart scan before I can clear either one of them for flight . It 's just not possible for both of them to come down with heart murmurs . It has to be an equipment error . Yeah , it has to be , right ? And you said that Mercury 's in retrograde ... so maybe this is a " Mercury in retrograde " thing . Please don 't encourage my mother . In a strange way , your mom 's kinda right . I mean , we 're hopelessly dependent on planet alignment . We 've got , like , what , 28 hours to leave Earth 's orbit or we 're screwed . And the next launch window isn 't for , like , six years . - Well , then we have to use Rollie and Ajay . - Actually , no . - I 'm not following . - Then you didn 't read the latest flight schedule . There 's a service pod headed for the space station tomorrow morning . And Ajay and Rollie 's alternates could possibly be on it . Hello , Ted . Hello , Donner . Don 't you dare go there . That 's six years alone up here with your old boyfriends . This is calcified plaque . Here , here and here . It 's on their aortic valves , which is causing the stenosis . Now , I don 't know how it got there or why it wasn 't there three days ago ... but I 've checked the results five times , and it 's real . The odds of this - of two men at the same time . Off the chart . Okay , Claire . Put a med team on it . Check for everything - diet , environment , viruses . And run a detailed analysis of every crew member 's genome . We gotta find out what 's causing this . I can 't clear these men for space travel . I think we got that . You 're excused . I 'll have Vandenberg get the pod ready . I want a few minutes . You don 't need more time , Mike . You know damn well what 's causing this . - And they 're going . - This is our mission . I am not gonna let that thing dictate any more of the crew . Wassenfelder 's bad enough . We don 't have a choice . - Do you think for a moment I want to send my husband ? - Well , that makes two of us . And Donner for about a hundred reasons . And who 's to say this thing isn 't gonna give them heart murmurs ? Well , there are no guarantees , Mike . None . We 're in uncharted territory here . But this seems to be what it wants . Whether you want to face it or not ... it has a lot more to say in this mission than we do . Remember last night I asked you about fate ? - Told you I don 't believe in fate . I 'm a Buddhist . - I didn 't tell you something . - I 'm having a dream about this mission . - And ? You and I are both on it . You 're both gonna need immediate physicals . You 'll have tonight to get your things in order ... then launch in the service pod tomorrow morning . - Report to Medical now ? - Yes , Donner . Leave us . Roger that . This wasn 't supposed to happen . Ted , you have no idea . We need to see the new mission commander upstairs . # Stitch # # In your knitted brow # # And you don 't know how # ♪ You 're gonna get it out ♪ ♪ Crush ♪ ♪ Under heavy change ♪ ♪ Trying to catch your breath ♪ # But it always speeds you # # By your step # # All right , now # # Making the best of it # # Playing the hand you get # # But you 're not alone in this # # Clean bill ofhealth .

I had it done when I got back from Mars . Well , yeah . Um - According to your chart , you did ... but not according to your scan . When were you gonna tell everybody else ? In 43 days - when you get to Venus . I 've always believed that this was my mission , my ship . That I was traveling on the path that Ganesha wanted for me . That this - Out here were where my challenges and obstacles lay . I feel so lost now . I cannot understand this . I cannot . Who needs this path more than I ? - Pop , I 'm going on the mission . It 's six years , and I don 't know if you 're gonna be here when I get back . You had the sweetest slider I ever saw . Fastball , changeup ... monster curve . You had all the tools . I wanted something else , Pop . Pour me another ' fore you leave . Here 's the stretch now . Maybe I could request a replacement . I could come back on the pod . No . There 's no time for that . Jen , forgive me . I want you to know that I was gonna be there with you . You 'd be there with me ? - Yeah . - For what ? For everything . Just remember how much I love you . Okay ? Show me .

It could be viral , environmental , something they were eating . We were eating . They 're looking into everything . Claire 's gonna be monitoring us all very closely . Did you hear that ? - What ? - That . - No . No . It 's the , uh - It 's the rotator arm . - I 'm gonna go check on Ajay . - Oh , tell him I got the porno up and running ... so he can pop his HALO off andjust enjoy . Zoe Barnes ? Uh , I 'm Ajay ... Sharma . - Hi , Ajay . - Hi . It 's a good thing that you won the bucket . - I 'm not so sure about that . - No , it - Upchucking - It is an obstacle that we all must face eventually ... and you were just fortunate enough to face it first . - Uh , there 's - I - Ajay , scram . - Girl talk . - Oh , uh , okay . Another time , then . Can I get a vodka cran , please ? Somebody 's got a boyfriend . If that 's vodka , drink up . - Thank God . I 'm not pregnant . - Oh , no , no . You are pregnant . Means you 're just not gonna have a baby . - Well , last time I looked , it was the law . - It 's a stupid law . You know , a couple of justices kick , and it 'll be reversed . Zoe , you have more than one option here . Yeah - I don 't know . There are over a thousand qualified applicants for your slot alone . I mean , getting into this program was winning the lottery . Believe me , I know . I know . Okay . So you cannot give it up for a one-night stand . I mean , you just can 't . Look , I know of a guy . He 's a doctor . When you 're ready , just give me the word . Think I need some air . - Zoe . Hey - - Not now . Dude , you don 't stand a chance . Ajay ? Mission Control , this is Antares . Antares , this is Control . Do we have permission to put up the cameras ? - You do indeed , Mission Control . And thank you for your discretion . Yeah , well , we didn 't want that to end up in Wassenfelder 's vidbank . Uh , listen , Rollie ... we just had the cameras and operation controls for the airlock corridors go off-line . We can 't seem to get ' em back up . Yeah , we 're seeing that too . I 'll get Ajay down to look at it . Actually , I think Ajay 's the problem . I just saw him enter the airlock corridor . I tried to follow , but he locked me out . Flight , I 'm showing an E.V.A. And M.M.U. Pack up and running . Damn it . He 's going for a walk . How soon until we can override his instructions ? We 're working on it . Give us five minutes . If he 's in that suit , we don 't have five minutes . - Where the hell 's Donner ? - On his way in . - And what 's the time to Venus burn ? - Six hours , nine minutes . Ajay 's heart rate and B.P. Are spiking . Antares , this is Control . Have you made contact ? Negative , Control . Rollie 's running through the channels . Looks like his comm 's off . This guy tested the most stable in the entire program . - Does anyone know if Hindus commit suicide ? - No , they don 't . Least I don 't think they do . Let me talk to him . - He 's turned his comm off . - Well , that 's not good . He 's moving away from the ship . Don 't do that , Ajay . Space travel is a fool 's game . Human beings are 60 % water . We sleep , eat , defecate , can 't follow directions ... and we explode like pinatas when exposed to the vacuum of space . What 's he doing ? Putting himself in orbit . Oh , Ajay . Well , wherever he 's going , I hope he makes it . Flight , we 've just been able to override his programming . We now have control of the airlocks . - Antares , this is Control . Did you copy that ? - We have that here . I 'll go out . I can go out and get him . We want to go out and get him . Do you copy ? Yeah . Let her go . Mike , let her go . Negative . I 'll eat the loss of an E.V.A. Suit . I can 't afford to lose another crew member . You and Shaw ship out in two hours . Get your ass in gear . - That 's it ? - That 's what ? You 're just gonna let him die ? I got six hours to launch a $ 10 trillion mission on its way to Venus . I don 't have time for Ajay and his silly little meltdown . And I sure as hell don 't have time for you . Don 't piss me off now , Donner . Not now . - Soon as I get back , I quit . Arnel , how much time has he got left in that suit ? Eight hours ? Give or take . My old man is right about every single item ... except the initial premise . Man belongs in space because of exactly what he brings into the void . We carry the baggage of our past - our fears , our superstitions , our failings . Mercury went direct two hours ago . It 's too late for Ajay . No , it isn 't . But we also carry our hopes and our dreams ... the hard lessons learned from our lives . Donner , Shaw , you dock your craft to the Antares right now . Uh , negative , Flight . Unless you can override these controls ... I think we 're gonna take a little detour . - They 're on 41 . Hell of a view out there , huh ? Ganesha and I have been enjoying it very much . Ganesha ? He is the lord of obstacles . But he 's also the lord of new beginnings . All right . Well , you wanna hitch a ride back in and start something new ? This is my path , Donner . Right here . All the way to Venus . Correct me if I 'm wrong here , Ajay , but if you stay out here ... doesn 't that mean you gotta start all over in the next lifetime ? Now , I mean , I 'm no expert . But you 're the one who 's always telling me that , uh - that each of us has lessons to learn ... and obstacles to overcome . So maybe this is your big one . You know ? Maybe you overcome this and you take a big step ... towards nirvana . - You don 't understand . - Wait , wait , wait . Wait a second . You think I don 't understand ? I think I do . My path is here on this ship with these people . Your path 's back on Earth , Ajay . But you know what ? We can 't do it alone . You , me , the ship - We 're a three-way . We need each other . For all our faults ... and whether we 're guided by our destiny or we guide it ourselves ... we 're resilient . We can adapt . There 's something I must do first . Yeah . We can find redemption in the simplest acts of humanity . I 've never heard of a robot or a probe that was able to do that . So ... if space travel 's a fool 's game , then , uh - Hey , that 's what I am . So be it . But I 've never felt more alive ... or more human . Antares , you are go for Venus in five , four , three ... two , one . Ignition . # Ain 't it good # ♪ To be alive ♪ # Ain 't it good # ♪ To be alive ♪ ♪ To feel the sun ♪ # Strong against your face # # It spills over me # # Like the Milky Way # Mmm . Ahh .

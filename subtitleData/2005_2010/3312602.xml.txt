 What happened to the dog ? I don 't know . He must be around . They 're getting scarce . Yes . And we 'll be out soon . There must be something we can do ... If you need them ? Use them . Period . And don 't ask any questions ... Fran Zembrino , the actress ' son Disappeared in this cave with two others guys . Renzo , this isn 't really news ! Not yet , but it could be . - I want you there just in case . - We 'll be the only ones there . Better still . Did you explain it to him ? Trust me . - I want us go back there right now . - What 's the matter ? We still have all afternoon . - We have all our life . - One moment please , they 're sleeping . They 'II be right with you . - Thanks . - Let me decide what 's best for me . Maria I 'd write a blank check for each and every word . Beware of those fantasies smart ass . Or you 'll end up with nothing . You dote on those fantasies . I live on fantasy . Happiness wasn 't meant for me . - Hello . - Sorry . Did I wake you ? Yes , this is a town . At this time of day , we are all sleeping . - Can I make a reservation ? - No , you can 't . It 's siesta time . OK . Sweet dreams . Just leave me alone . I could never be faithful . Not you , nor anybody . This is Lala Zembrino , one of her last photos . And this is a photo of the cave ... And you want us there because Lala Zembrino 's son is missing ? Yes . And because she may show up in the town . Will they come and get us ? No . They 'll wait for us to leave . Why ? No one in this town dares come in here . - I thought she was dead . - Who knows ? There was no funeral ... One day she just vanished . That was forty years ago . He disappeared a few days ago and the mother had been in that cave - Do you have enough ? - Yes . I still have some . Here , take a few more in case ... See ? It 's got rhythm . No matter what he says , he keeps his rhythm . Keeps them glued to the TV . - I won 't be able to speak that fast . - Don 't worry . It 's easy . I 'll explain later . Love you . I tried to make reservations by phone but no one took them . Don 't worry about it . Renzo 's made them already . Renzo ? Julieta . Isn 't this all a bit strange ? Don 't worry about it . Just be careful . - What do you mean , careful ? - Yes , it 's one a day , a while before recording . Why ? What happens ? I have no idea . But just in case , take only one . No , really . I don 't know ... maybe we shouldn 't be ... Trust me . They can 't harm you . Everybody 's taken them and nothing ever happened . OK ? Is this the Pablo you mentioned ? Yes . Take it . Come on , don 't worry . I 'll register you in . Who 's this beauty in the photo ? Ah ... a friend . Don 't you recognize her ? It 's Lala Zembrino , the actress . Of course . I meant the other one . Ah ... her ? That 's me . Why ? Hello . Is something the matter ? No . I was ... like transported . That rhythm ... An allegro con fuoco . Right ? Yes . You 're the guy who ... called yesterday , right ? The very same . What 's your room number ? Room five . This way . - You treated me really badly . - Normal . - Don 't you want people to stay here ? - Don 't really care . I just want to get out of here . - You 're journalists , aren 't you ? - Yes . I didn 't imagine you like this . - How then ? - I don 't know . I didn 't expect sensitive souls to music . - Well , let me be the exception . - Sure . You can ask my aunt for breakfast between 8 : 30 and 10 : 30 . The towels are in the closet ... Don 't throw the paper in the toilet . It clogs . Don 't worry . We sensitive souls don 't use the bathroom . - And where do you want to go to ? - To Buenos Aires . - What for ? - I 'm preparing for a piano audition . You play really well . - How old are you ? - How old do you think ? - I don 't know , not old . - Well , I 'm older than you think . - Here are the keys . - Thanks . How 'd you know the rhythm on the metronome ? I can 't tell you . It 's a secret . And if I told you how old I am ? In that case , it 's different . - But you 'd have to go first . - Forget it . I don 't trust you . OK . Come here . Give me your hand . Well ... what about our deal ? Fourteen ... on Saturday . Tree explorers disappear in a cave . Fran Zembrino , Igor and Mauricio . Fran is trapped where his mother disappeared years ago . Lala Zembrino , the renowned actress . Just a few pictures remain . Fran was raised by nannies far from his mother , of whom we 've known nothing in 40 years . Witness report to saw her ... What does seek in the cave ? What lies behind the lady 's veil ? Everything that happens , happens , Be the first to know , beforehand . That 's great ! See . It wasn 't so bad . What 's that ? Don 't touch it ! - Why ? - I don 't know . Mauricio , I 'm getting tired of this ... - This was the guide . - What guide ? My mother 's . How do you know that ? He was the one who died . - Is him ? - No , this is Narciso . Metronome . What 's the matter , Ana ? - I 'm losing my rhythm . - You should practice more . The class is over . Ana , you have a good ear . But it 's not enough . Let 's leave this piece for now . - But the exam is on Wednesday . - You need to increase the speed . Let 's leave it for next year . They won 't have me next year . I 'll be too old . - Bye . - Bye . - Who is she ? - Just a friend . Now she 's going to start again . It 's a difficult piece . And very fast . It reminds me of something . - Isn 't it from a film ? - No , but it resembles " The Hands of Orlac " - Could be . How 'd it go ? - He 's a pianist who loses his hands in an accident . He has a hand transplant . That 's it ! He wanted to play this piece but couldn 't . - Why ? - His hands belonged to an assassin and when he started playing , he had criminal urges . Those films are all the same . You cannot alter the natural order . He who rebels suffers terribly in the end . - That 's the way it is . - Not always . - Let 's change the subject ? - Don 't worry . For something to happen , she has to play two consecutive musical phrases At last ! What will you have for dinner ? - Need any help ? - No . You should use gloves for that . This is how we do it here . - What are you doing up so early ? - I couldn 't sleep . Must be your heart . It beats too fast . - Could be ... - Where 's your girlfriend ? - Sleeping . - So ... she is your girlfriend . No . She 's my wife , actually . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . You should care for your hands if you play the piano . - It 's nothing . - Show me . - What for ? I 'm fine . - Let me see . - Let me put cream on that . - You use cream ? Not me , my wife . Nice ! What do you keep inside it ? It 's a secret . Aren 't you going to tell me ? - No . - Why not ? If you won 't tell me , don 't . You 'll tell me at some point . I 'll find something to negotiate with . We 'd have to get to know each other too well . I don 't think I 'd even tell you then . Stop . Don 't you feel something weird here ? Something that 's holding us back ... No , not me . And you ? Me neither . Let me see the map ? We 're here , there should be a trail here . And where is it ? The place caves in , Mauricio . That can change the trails . What do you mean by trails can change ? Yes ... maybe . So , the places we 've passed they don 't exist anymore ? Fran . What now ? Well , if the trails change our only chance is to get lost . If so , we 're doing great . Little is known of the explorers who escaped from the cave . No one ever said a world . As if they all ... guarded a common secret . They say that the cave gradually swallowed . The few men who ventured in . Maybe Fran needed to travel to the end of this labyrinth where his mother was lost many years ago . Everything that happens , happens . Be the first to know , beforehand . Good . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . - Are you sure ? - Yes , everything 's fine - You 're acting weird . - I 'm a little dizzy . It 's happened before . I feel as if you were talking slower . When , before ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I told you it was weird from the beginning . - How much did you take ? - Just one . Count them . - What are you doing ? - I 'm keeping them . You 're not taking any . - You 'll get in trouble , Julieta ? - I don 't care . They 'd be stupid to fire me because of this . They 'll fire you then . I 'll find something else . I don 't yet understand why you wanted me to come . I thought it would do you good . That if we could share something maybe things got better between us . Or ... did you want me to meet Pablo ? That has nothing to do with it . Although , maybe , this needed a definition of some sort . Let 's head back guys ! - How ? - I don 't know . Let 's try that way ... I 'm not going back . Well then , I 'm leaving by myself . I think you should come with us . - Why ? - Because you 're really scared . And that attracts danger . Let him go then , Fran . I 'm not following you . I 'm not going with a madman . Can you hear that ? - What ? - The absolute silence . It 's gone . It rarely happens . It 's as if the whole world stopped . The animals are quiet and the wind is still for a few seconds . Hey ! Are you going to town for dinner ? Yes , to see what 's happening . If you want , we can have dinner then , you can do your thing . Thanks . I prefer to do my own thing . - I 'm dead tired . - OK . Bye . - Another time . - See you . - Excuse me . Have you seen my niece ? - No - We saw her this morning . - She 's nowhere . I 'm going into town . Maybe somebody saw her . Don 't worry , she must have a boy somewhere . I don 't think so . She should be back . I rarely go out myself . I don 't like going out alone at night . - Shall I go with you ? - It 's not necessary . - You must have things to do . - No , I 'll go with you . Remember we have an early start tomorrow ... He 's dead , Fran . In the end , he was right . There is something funny here . She only cares about her piano . She says the town boys are all stupid . I think she 's left town . She 's obsessed with leaving . It 's my fault for letting Carmen put those ideas in her head . - Who is Carmen ? - Her piano teacher . Let 's go to her house . I called her today but she didn 't answer . Carmen ! Carmen ! I think we found her . Felipe , we have to talk to Carmen . Come on Felipe ... Just for a second . What is it that you want ? Don 't just stand there like an idiot ? Have you seen my niece ? She 's definitely not here . Just what we needed . - Did she say anything about leaving ? - No . Hello . Just keep on putting those ideas into her head . Don 't start that again . I 'd better not say what I 'm thinking . There are men present . But if she 's left , it 's on your account ... If so , don 't worry . She hasn 't got a chance at the audition ... Excuse me . Are you coming from the cave ? - Did you see my niece ? - No . Are you sure ? We haven 't seen her for hours . The last time someone saw her , she was around there . Don 't worry , Ma 'am . She 'II show up . All right . Thank you . What was that ? I don 't know . Fran ! Fran ! It 's her writing . - Fran , did you see that ? - Yes . Look at that . Were you out all night ? Yeah . We didn 't find her . I 'll take a shower and we can go . It 's OK to worry ... but don 't forget we 're working . I won 't neglect the work . She must have run away a hundred times . It 's like that in small towns She probably dates the milkman since she was seven . You 're adorable , today . Thanks , love . Sometimes , you look like the fourteen year old . Fourteen ? I thought she was older . She 's a kid . Are you jealous ? Sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . - Any news on your niece ? - No . - What do you want ? - I 'm a little hungry . - So ? - I woke up and couldn 't sleep . Ah ... you slept ? Why ? Does it worry you ? No , look this is off limits . The dining room opens at eight . So what then ? I 'm hungry . I told you . You can 't be in here , wait outside . OK . Call me if you need anything . I 'm fine . Don 't go looking for me . You won 't find me . Ana I 'm waiting for you Are you OK ? Can you hear me ? Let me see . Are you Ana ? Are you Ana ? Can you hear me ? Can you talk ... What took you so long ? Why ? How long has it been ? For you , it 's been a night . But for me , a long time . - No , don 't . - Don 't worry , she can 't see us . - Why ? - Because we 're moving too fast . Are we moving too fast or is it that they 've stopped ? No , they 're moving as usual . It is us who are in fast motion and see them like that . So , you were waiting for me ? Yes . I 'd hoped you 'd know how to get back . But , it seems you have no idea . I guess the effect must wear off at some point . Or , we 'll just have to get used to one other . Yes . Well , I 'm going to bed . I 'm a little tired . - What ? Are you still taking siestas ? - It 's not a nap . - Yes it is . It 's day time . - But it 's a long time before dark . No , wait . I had a busy day . - Pick your house of choice . - Cool . Good morning . Good morning . How long did I sleep ? A few seconds with any luck . That 's more than enough . - How did you now I was here ? - It 's the biggest house and bed in town . I used to come here too at first . If you 've tried it all , then tell me what 's best and we can save time . Mine 's the best but , I 'm not going to share it with you . The bed or the house ? Neither . Did you have an allergic reaction ? My back itches all over . That 's not a symptom , it 's just the grime . I think I preferred you as a teenager . I don 't think so . - What are you doing ? - I 'm trying to scratch myself . If only it had longer legs . Can you help me ? A little more to the left and up ... Harder and further down . Towards the centre , Lower ... Lower . There . That 's enough . Come with me . I 'll show you something , you 'll want to see . I discovered a way out of the cave . No one knows it . - How did you find it ? - I had lots of time . When I went in , I left signs to avoid getting lost . - And , did you see them ? - Yes . I signaled the way out . Look . - What about the rest ? - One died . The other , didn 't follow the signs . - Or he didn 't see them ? - Yes he did . He decided to stay , to find something . - Looking for what ? - I don 't know . They found a manuscript . It mentioned a substance it could only be found in that type of soil . - Do they have enough food ? - I don 't know . Now they can leave if they want to . Come on . I need more clothes . It will be hot when the sun is out . - Are you wearing your old clothes ? - No , I 'll use my mother 's . - And where is she ? - She died . My aunt told me she kept her old clothes . She tries them on to see if they fit ... but she never gets thin so they must be in the closet . - We should come back another day . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . - Let me see . Ana , come here ! I 'd better not . - Why ? It 's something natural . - But she 's my aunt . So ? Don 't aunts have sex ? - What ? - Don 't they have sex ? - OK . Well ... - Come on , choose some clothes . Don 't tell me that you 've never spied on anyone in all this time . - That 's what you 'd have done . - You know , I don 't believe you . You 'II never know , will you ? So you think you know me well ? I don 't see how when I was a girl , you would ... - I ... what ? Tell me . - Nothing . Well ... I haven 't talked to anyone in a while . So if you 'd just keep quiet . He 's finally opened . Going in through the back was uncomfortable . Why is there so little food ? I 've been eating it all . Could I make dinner ? Please yourself . But mind you , I 'm not easy . You 're not ? How about roast lamb with mashed peas and mint sauce ? You won 't find that here . There are chips , nuts ... That sort of thing . No . You 'll like it . - I don 't know , I 'd have to try it . - You 'll see ... Why don 't you pick the wine ? You 'll like this one , it 's expensive . No , this doesn 't go with lamb . We should take ... A young Malbec . - As you wish . I 'm having coke . - No you 're not ! - What are you doing ? - I taking them just in case . No . - I 'll take them . It 's the best with chips . - What are you doing ? - We 'll get it later . - I don 't have much money . - Are you going to pay ? Sure . I 've known the owner all my life . I 'm not going to steal . Not this either . - Where are you getting the money from ? - Stealing it from the bank . What 's wrong ? Nothing , I 'll be fine . It must be the poor diet . You are going to have a proper meal . A while ago , you told me it would take a minute Good things take time . Are you OK ? I don 't know . - Maybe the effect is wearing off ? - I hope not . And why not ? Will you bring me the chips ? Don 't eat junk . I 'll speed up dinner . Are you eating junk ? It doesn 't cook . I don 't know why . To cook with this fire you 'd need years . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - Because you didn 't ask . But we went to the supermarket , got the meat ... - Did you know this would happen ? - Yes . But you had to experience it for yourself . I see you 're feeling better , aren 't you ? And I 'll be even better when you beg me for chips . - That 'll never happen . - Are you going to starve then ? No . You 'll give me one without my asking . - You 're crazy . - Then , I 'll take it by force now . - I 'll report you . - To whom ? You 're taking advantage of the situation ! No , you are . Come here ! At last . I thought I 'd never manage it . Here is your prize . I 'm tired of breakfast . What will we do when there is nothing left in this town ? - Move to another one . - Did you ever try that ? Yes ... but I came right back . I knew you 'd find me someday . Plus , there were no pianos in tune . I often imagined this ... - but something is missing . - And what is that ? To be able to tell somebody . Tell it to me . I 'm Carmen . Well ... Remember this guy we didn 't like that much ? Who ? The good looking one ? No , he was normal . OK . Well , I 'm giving him a chance . Why is that ? I don 't even know why . And ... what else ? - He has a problem . - What ? He 's married ... He must look at this as a minor episode in his life . I don 't think so . I know the sort . He seems pretty hooked . Plus , I feel so weird . I don 't let him even get close . What about him ? He 's a little slow . He respects my space . What a fool . I thought they didn 't make those anymore . It seems that they do . I think you should choose your friends better . Yes . I agree . - OK . Now it 's your turn . - For what ? Your turn to tell someone . Mine ? I don 't need to tell anyone . Come on , your go . Talk ... - I know what I 'm doing . - Don 't get angry . - Any news on your niece ? - Yes . She left a letter ... She 'll be back when she runs out of money . Good morning . Will you be staying ? - No , I just want something to eat . - You look familiar . - Is this your first time here ? - No , I was here as a child . See ? - I never forget a face . - Yes , you seem very observant . - I can only offer you tea or coffee . - I have no toast or croissants . - I need to eat . - I 've been robbed . - That 's terrible . We 're all missing things . You must have something hot and salty . Some pasta perhaps ... At this time of day ? I have money , to pay you . - Hello ? - Hello , Gise . - Where have you been ? - Here ... Wasting my time . - Anything on our story ? - Not that I 've seen . People have been asking about you . Really ? Put Renzo on . He 's not here . We haven 't heard from him lately . If you see him , tell him to call me . Bye . - Have you seen Alex ? - No . Where are you ? Here . Hugging you How do I go back ? A matter of time - How are you ? - OK . - OK , I think . - You 're back so soon ! - To me , it seemed forever . - I was going to wait . - Obviously . I waited for you . - What did you wait ? - For years , for you to grow up . - That was really fast . But I was ready to wait for as long as it took . - What a liar ! - No , I mean it . I must get to Buenos Aires . - The audition is today . - I 'm going with you . What ? And what will you tell your wife . It doesn 't matter . Don 't worry . I want us to stay together . After all we 've been through ... Don 't exaggerate . It was only three minutes . Wait for me at the door at the theatre . OK . I 'II count on you . - Finally . Where have you been ? - I went for a walk . - What 's the matter ? - I took too many . How many ? Are you crazy ? I told you it could be dangerous . Don 't worry . Now , just tell me everything you know about this . What I know is that Renzo buys them from a so called Narciso . When you recover , we have work to do . They are asking too many questions . If they catch us , - we 'll be wasting the morning . - I can 't go on . I can 't go on , this is all crazy . Maybe . But you should have listened . Look at you ... so dirty ... Didn 't you just take a bath ? I 'm quitting and I think you should too . Let 's get today over with . We 'll talk about it later . Narciso . I couldn 't find you and was really scared . - Why ? - I don 't know . I though something could happen ... For a second , I thought you wouldn 't come back . He 's delirious . Says he saw a virgin who helped them get out . - Igor ? - Who are you ? - I believe you . Then tell them to follow the signs and get Fran . Why doesn 't he follow them ? What is he looking for ? He wants to know why he was abandoned . I took something . I was the first woman to even try it , Narciso and I traveled to the centre of the cave ... Where there was a spring of red glowing liquid . He was always afraid of the unknown ... and wanted me to try it first . Everything began to slow down . Narciso was petrified ... when he saw me ... disappear . The pills are more dangerous than we thought . I need you to give them all back . Why ? What happened ? They found Renzo 's body . It looked 120 years old ... - I don 't have any left . - They need to study the pills . - I don 't have any . - Where are the missing pills then ? I don 't know . It 's hard to explain . What are you saying ? And what the fuck are you looking at ? Stop . - What are you doing ? - Let me see . - Why did you take them ? - I didn 't . Ana did ... - Who 's Ana ? - She 's the girl you saw this morning when you were with Pablo . - How do you know that ? - Because I saw you . I was looking for you while you were spying on me ? No . It 's hard to explain . And , you wouldn 't believe me . It doesn 't matter ! Say it regardless . I was so accelerated that you couldn 't see me . To me , it was as if time had stopped . For you , time stopped a long time ago . - You 're right . More than a year ago . - Since you stopped working . No , since you lost interest in me . - Why do you say that ? - Because it 's true . - Tell me who Ana is . - What for ? It 's not worth it . - I want to hear it . - She 's the hotel owner 's niece . For you it 's been a moment , for us , much longer . - I don 't understand . - It 's weird but that 's how it is . But she grew old and you didn 't . I accelerated for a moment . She accelerated all night . Where are you going ? To Buenos Aires . What ? Don 't do this to me . You were a one night stand . - And you did for love ? - No , I 'm fine on my own . Are you in love with the chauffeur ? - No ! Lord , no ! - Lf it 's serious , ask him to stay . - The guy is up for grabs . - You 're crazy ? - Let him go . - So ... what 's all the fuss about ? - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . Just pay and let 's go . What is happening here . It won 't start . Let 's see ... start the car . - What 's happening ? - Come on , give it some more . - Go on ... - Well ? What 's wrong ? It won 't work . Call the mechanic . If a normal minute ... equals 1440 minutes of accelerated time ... This girl ... the kid ... spent nine hours , it means she 's been 7.000 , 700 ... Alex , it was much easier to say it 's over between us ? Excuse me . Are the auditions over ? - Yes . - I 'm looking for a friend . Ana Berardi . Have you seen her ? Let 's see ... No , there 's no one with that name . Could you check again ? She has light brown hair , she 's thin , has blond curls , wears an antique locket . I know ! Her ID said she was fourteen . - Come on ! - Did she audition ? No , she was too old for the orchestra . - Why ? What 's the age limit ? - Fifteen . Though , she said she 'd audition for the symphonic orchestra . - And when is that ? - Tomorrow . At 10 am . - She has to learn all repertoires - She may just make it ... From one day to he next ? She won 't have time . Plus , there is something you can only achieve with time . Sorry . Ana , I thought I 'd never find you . Renzo 's dead . Give me the pills ... - Why weren 't you here before ? - It got complicated , Ana . This is very dangerous ... It 's too late now . What did you do ? I thought you wouldn 't come . No , give it to me . I 'II go with you . I don 't have any . I hope we meet again . Who are you ? Your son , Fran . Stay there . Don 't move . How could you lock her up like this ? I didn 't force her . She wanted to isolate herself . To stop time and be remembered like that . I had to create a world ... in which nothing moved . You are a coward ! You gave her something you 'd never have taken . I had to spare her from the passing of time . And did so as best I could . Now it 's your turn to take it and die in the same way Renzo did . These are for you . All for you . - Fran ! - Who are you ? I need to find the person who helped you out of the cave . Is this what you want ? - Yes . - No . This is the last of it . There are no more raw materials . - The cave is dried up . - Give it to me ! I have to find her . It 's not worth it . They 'll ruin your life . - They took everything I had . - And me . But I still have some time to get her back . Is this staying ? No , we 're taking it . I 've had it since I was a child . Don 't you want to take that one too . - You always liked it . - OK . Thanks . What did you tell him ? That you were my uncle . - Shall we go in ? - I 'll be right there .

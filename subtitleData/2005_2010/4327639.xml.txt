 Breakfast in bed . I got an orange and a bag of carob pretzels . That 's all they had in the mini-bar . Why don 't you put that crap down and come over here ? Hello , girls . Remember me ? Dumpling ? Have you had some work done ? I can barely get my hands around them . They 're exactly the same size . - Are you riding your menstrual cycle ? - No ! What are you getting at ? That maybe you 're hiding something from me ? Like a little gift that Phantom Limb left in your oven . All right . I knew you couldn 't handle this . It 's crazy ! We 've been meeting in this crappy hotel ... like , three times a week and it 's going nowhere ! All right , fine , I 'll do Thursdays , too ! But only for , like , an hour . Which means we have to get right to the dirty deed ! I give you permission to begin without me . Gee , thanks . Look , I keep coming home with welts on my neck ... and the " I got jumped by Flying Squid " excuse ... is starting to get Phantom Limb a wee bit suspicious . Screw Phantom Limb ! No , wait , no , don 't . Don 't you get it ? ! I love you ! But I don 't want this ! All right . Fine ! Oh , crap . You 're crying . I ... I ... Marry ... me ? Stop it , I 'm worn down from all this ! I should go . - Marry me . - You 're being serious ? Deadly serious ! - Yes . - Good ! Done . Now get your ass back in that bed ! But we need to make some ground rules . One . No more of this " I need my space , you 're crowding me " crap . Fine , whatever . Where were you hiding that list ? Two ! I 'm not your number two . I 'm your partner . OK . I 'll get you a crown or something . Anything else on that magic and probably moist list of yours ? Yes , number three . This whole Dr. Venture thing is over . Yes ! We kill him once and for all ! And we shall make slaves of his sons ... and a lamp from the flesh of Brock Samson ! No ! I want you to give up ... this insane grudge you have with Dr. Venture once and for all ! No way ! Dr. Venture is my sworn enemy ! Never mind then , I knew you weren 't serious ! No , no , don 't go ! Fine , I 'll do it . No more arching Dr. Venture . - Ever ? - Never . - Swear . - I pinky swear ! OK ? Are you happy now ? The happiest woman alive . He 's gonna kill us . - Maybe if we beg for mercy . - God , let him . It would be such sweet release ... from this torture we 've brought upon ourselves . F ... it , you kill me . Just don 't hit my head or make too much noise doing it . I have an idea , Chunk . You open this door , and I 'll kill ya . What did we do ? Sh ... ! I thought I dreamt that part . Apparently , you lost your hearing as well as your arms . I said I 'm getting married to your girlfriend ! Yes , yes . I heard you . You surprise me , Limb . You 're taking this pretty well . I thought you 'd try to kill me . I 'm no fool , Monarch . You don 't live with a woman and not know when this is coming . You don 't dine on the bounty of a woman 's flesh and not know what she 's thinking . - OK , OK . You don 't drive your manhood over and over into a woman and ... Yes , stop . I get it ! Just give me her sh ... and let me go . She needs something old . In due time . I thought we 'd have a nice chat first . There 's one . - Was that Mr. Monday ? - Yes . You two were in prison together , were you not ? I saw him ... around . I think . You 'd be surprised at the array of wildlife here on the grounds . Wonder what other game we could scare up . Dr ... Septapus ? Oh , don 't tell me . Not another one of your former prison mates ? What are the odds ? All right , Limb . What 's going on here ? Just disposing of some vermin . Terrible , the havoc they can wreak ... on a meticulously manicured lawn , you know . OK , OK , fine . So what did you do ? Bust all these guys out of jail just to show me how ruthless you are ? What do you take me for , a common thug ? Of course not . I hired them an excellent appeals attorney . And there he is . Please ! Phantom Limb ! I did everything you asked ! I 'm a reasonable man , Monarch . But don 't think for a moment that I will forget this . Revenge , like gazpacho soup ... is best served cold , precise and merciless . Oh , yeah . You can never have enough precision in your soup . Look , nutjob , I hate these traitorous dinks more than you do ! So shoot whoever you want . Go . Her sh ... is by the door in a box marked " Hers . " It 's like playing keep-away with the neighborhood spastic . Can 't get a bead on him . You should give us the all-seeing orb . " You should ? " nice , Al . Very polite . What ? You catch more flies with honey . - Give us the eye , or face oblivion ! - Please ! Fat chance , ladies . Weep the tears of damnation ! Form the Thaumaturgic Man-Mound ! Man , Orpheus , what are you wearing ? Golf shoes ? I think my hand is bleeding . And the squirming ... I think it 's the flip part . That 's the zing . We need the zing . Well , the zing hurts my hand . Well , if we practiced more often than once a month ... Hey , look ! I 'm in / The Residents ! Does anybody else feel even slightly embarrassed here ? Only most of the time . Practice makes perfect ! We shall meet at my home for some real training . Yeah ! Slumber party ! Are you out of your f ... minds ? ! They were going to be our gift to you guys . " On this your wedding day . " You dicks ! I promised her ! I made a pinky swear ! A sacred pinky swear ! Dr. Fiancée is going to flip ! And then she will never have sex with me again ! - How does he do that ? - I can hear that in my eyes ! Will you shut up and listen to your leader ? ! Do not do that . OK . We get it . We screwed up . Just use the quiet voice , please . Look , don 't think I 'm not impressed . I am . That isn 't what this is about . I 'd love to know why you couldn 't pull this off ... at , like , any point in the last ten years , but ... Wait a minute . How the hell did you pull this off ? Well , after the party died down and you went to bed ... you know , some of us were still pretty wired ... and so we decided to pick up a case and hit the tenderloin . Loin . Mind you , we were wicked toasted by this point ... which is when I spotted this tattoo parlor ... and I just had to get me some ink . See ? I 've had this design in my wallet for , like , a year ... but , you know , that sh ... is permanent . - You never had the balls . - Guilty . But once this Cowardly Lion got himself some courage ... from that Wizard of Booze , we went in there . Stand by . OK , so we get in there . And who should we see , not , like , ten feet away ... getting himself a sweet friggin ' tat ? None other than Brock Samson , murderist extraordinaire . Slayer of men , slayer of henchmen . He , who would , and has , totally ripped our heads off if he saw us coming . Which , of course , he didn 't , so we got the jump on him . Now there were , of course , the predictable casualties . Of course . But once he was , like , totally out of the picture ... we naturally got to thinking ... Dr. Venture 's , like , easy pickings now . And what better gift to get The Monarch , than his arch-nemesis ? Honey ! I 'm going to start getting dressed . I just want ... What the f ... ? Funny face ! You 're ... - Hi . - I can 't believe you . You couldn 't keep a promise for one lousy month ? ! That 's it . I 'm calling this off . No , no , no , no . This isn 't how it looks . You 've got Dr. Venture and his whole f ... family in that f ... cell ... and this isn 't how it looks ? No . Of course not , pookums . He 's ... He 's my best man . You know , I wanted to prove to you ... I was going to let bygones be bygones . Turn over a new leaf . Then why are they in our holding cell ? Because , well ... we were rehearsing the whole ring thing , you know ... and the blonde kid , he was all , like , " Is that a real prison cell ? " And I 'm like , " Yeah , you want to see inside ? " And between you and me , the kid 's not the sharpest tack . Pretty sure he thinks we 're in a submarine . Where are we ? - See ? - All right , fine . Well , I got to get ready . The next time I see you , we 'll be man and wife . Can 't wait . See you later ... Mr. Girlfriend . / A bientôt , Dr. Mrs. Monarch . The Council of 13 has reviewed your request and it is denied . You are to commit no acts of vengeance against The Monarch . It matters not that you were dumped . And that 's kinda ... you know . - I understand , Sovereign . - May I suggest you start a journal ? There you could pour out your woes upon the tear-stained pages of dear diary . That is an excellent suggestion , my liege . Or maybe go jogging with friends . I shall do just that ! You honor me , my master . So I have your word then ? No movement on The Monarch . - You have my word . - Excellent ! Well , I 'm glad we got this wrapped up . I 've got a wedding to get to . I 'm gonna go . I can 't thank you jerks enough . So , you and Manwich are finally tying the knot , huh ? I always figured you for a closet case . In your dreams , macho man . I 'm about to marry the hottest piece of ass in Supervillainy . - Why would you do this ? - What , be a henchman ? Yeah ! Retardo costume , some skinny guy yelling at you all the time ... Dude , are you describing me or you ? - I don 't wear a costume . - What ! ? Are you drunk ? Where do you even buy a baby blue kerchief ? I just said kerchief . Dude , what , does your dad use his time machine to go shopping ? Are the walls titanium , or made of secret rocket-ship metal ? What ? Who cares ? I know they 're wicked easy to stain . Then we can rule out any chromium-based metals . Those clean nicely with a damp cloth . All right . I 'll " rule that out . " So ... you ... like being a ... - Dean ? - Yeah , a Dean . That must kind of ... suck . Come on , that voice ! ? Sounds like a dude ! - Probably still half a dude . - Hell-o , jealous much ? Excuse me , but I am not the rough trade ... in a tight camisole with a naked guy tattooed on my arm ! It 's not finished . Supposed to be Icarus . You know , from the / Led ... / Zeppelin albums , yeah , yeah . Super f ... cool ! When I was , like , 14 . Sweetie , it 's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding . It 's Doct ... Rusty Venture . - I have something for you . - Sorry . I brought you something blue . Me . So ... you agreed to be the best man . That 's rather big of you . That 's not the only thing that 's big of me . Are you trying to say something sexual ? Don 't play games here ... Charlene . Who is Charlene ? Why don 't you two go help Willy Wonka or something ? This is grown-up business . Who is Charlene ? ! Only the finest woman in 18 years to steal my heart ... only the sexiest pile of girl parts to climb Mount Rusty . What ? I have no idea what you 're ... Oh , my God ! I 'm here ! And I 've got some fancy beer ... and some chips that are guaranteed to be extreme ! - How is that possible ? - I don 't know . By putting a lightning bolt on the bag . Where 's JT ? I got him a surprise . - He 's setting up the apparatus . - Apparatus ? Sounds sexy . Al , what is that ? I need earplugs to look at your shirt . I 'm in disguise as a paunchy gay guy who loved Jimmy Buffett . I thought you were setting up an apparatus ! That 's a pilates mat and a baby 's first birthday candle . Orpheus is trying to hone our conjuring skills . Great . I 'll try to work up some interest . But in the meanwhile , what say you gents to ... taking the edge off ? For one , it 's only noon , and two , I don 't drink . Drink . I know . I have here , in this very bag ... five packs of nickel nips . Maybe after we have filled our bellies with the super-natural . There is much to do ! Yeah , like watch JT go blind on red-flavored sugar water . Orpheus , get the insulin ! It 's been a while . What 's that ? ! You say you 're waxy good . You tease . I think I 've still got an old costume you can wear . And before you say it , I was much slimmer then . I was gonna say you have more toys than a little girl . - What ? Dude , there are no toys in here . - What do you call that ? - That 's a maquette . - Doll . And that ? - That is a collectable bust . - That is a toy . How can you play with a disembodied head ? Well , he could be like a ... like an all-knowing head that tells ... - Quisp ? - That tells Quisp that he has to kill ... - The micronaut . - Kill the micronaut . - So do you wanna ... - Only if I get to be that He-Man head . I bet I know what I 'd like to do . Is it sit quietly till the wedding begins ? No , silly ! I would sure love a tour of the engine room . I 've only read about engines that run on anti-matter . OK , there , junior science cadet . Why don 't you go exploring or something ? Just don 't touch anything . Aye-aye , sir . I 'll touch with my eyes , not with my hands . Care to escort this cadet ? That 's a negative , Cadet Dean ... who really should be going now . Under orders ? That 's preposterous ! - You were all over me . - That was my mission . I seduce you , turn you into a butterfly ... and then The Monarch was going to tie you to this huge bug zapper thing . But you didn 't ! You gave me the antidote . And why ? Because I turned the tables and made you fall for me . - You didn 't even know it was me ! - Well , I do now . And I put two and two together , and that equals forever . All right . Basics . You understand that you 're my boyfriend 's archenemy ? You know how this works , right ? I know what works . I know that / we works . And I know as sure as sugar that you planned this whole thing . Yes . Exactly . That was my big dream . I wanted to get The Monarch and Dr. Venture together ... and then do them both . I 'm not willing to share you . You have to make a choice . What 's a girl to do ? Will you zip me up ? You kicked my moppets out . Die ! Die ! - I killed Hugo ! - You totally missed ! Oh , my God ! So wrong ! Solarian has , like , 20 / two billion vision . Cool beans ! The beard comes off . Hello-ski ! I am , how you say , Russian Guyovitch ! Hank , you should totally grow one of those ! You look like Green Arrow . Or , like , the mirror mirror version of Hank ! - Yeah , Evil Hank ! - Yeah , Evil Hank , completely . Crap , is that the time ? Dude , the guests will be here any minute and I 'm not even dressed ! Hello , Rusty , it 's time to get up ! OK , come on , we 've got work to do . And then , like , that wasn 't enough ... I ended up with a raging case of crotch crickets . And did I get an apology ? Hell , no . I got a , " I 'll call you . " Still waiting for that chestnut . OK , Byron , your turn . Truth or dare . You 're actually talking to me ? Truth . Did you really think you could get a bunch of middle-aged men together ... to chase bad guys around and take it seriously ? Well , yes , I did , as a matter of fact . The Order of the Triad has potential . Potential ? When JT was conscious ... he was throwing up artificial cherry-flavored vomit . And I 'm a little Busby Berkeley myself . Just don 't touch anything . What could go wrong ? You know I 'm on the PA and not in your mind , right ? What ? Yeah . I wasn 't going to push it . - Good . Now get to the wedding . - Okie-dokie . - Good . You going to the ceremony ? - Yes ... sir . The radar 's been lit up like a Christmas tree . You got to get these radars to The Monarch , pronto . Keep it hush , OK ? What is that ? - You seen my brother ? - Nah , he 's probably sitting down ... torturing Monstroso with Snapple Facts . Nah , I don 't think ... Holy moly ! That guy is almost a truck ! Truckulese ? - Yeah . - With a " T. " Here you are ... and your guest . Came stag , friend . This big ol ' rig takes up two seats . OK , but you only get one bag of Jordan Almonds . Bride 's side , fourth row , seats 6-7 . - Where am I sitting ? - You are ... next to ... Sergeant Hatred and guest . No . Look at that , honey ! Look at that ! Tell me those aren 't the monitors from my old hover tank ? What the hell kind of a deal is this ... what kind of a shabby operation they running here ? You 're not gonna bad touch me , are you ? Do I know ? Honey , do we know him ? No ! Hello-ski ! I am ... How you say ? Russian Guyovitch ! Sergeant Hatred , pleased to meet you ! This here 's Princess Tiny Feet . Show him , honey . Show him the little gentlemen . So she is . Look at those perfect little toes , so plump ! Like little nibblets ! Like little corn nibblets ! - Maize . - That 's right , honey ! Hot damn it ! Those things are beautiful ! Gimmie , gimmie ! Gimmie just a little ! Gimmie just ... - No way ! - Is that ? David Bowie . - Brock Samson , it 's been a while . - Not long enough . You 're lucky I don 't kill you right here after what you pulled in Berlin . You 're welcome to try . - What the hell are you doing here ? - He 's giving me away . You look fabulous ! Thank you so much for doing this , David . And one , two ... All right . Left foot on the one but don 't enter until the second verse ! I 'll know when to go out . - She 's too good for you . - Are you still mad at me ? What ! ? I 'm suddenly supposed to be your best friend ? I can 't remember a day of my life that you didn 't f ... up . Calm down . Look at all that history ! We have so much in common . You don 't know the half of it , buddy-boy . What is that supposed to mean ? There she is ! Hi , pookums ! - I feel so dirty when they start talking cute . - Get used to it . I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot . Are you reciting / Jessie 's Girl ? Sorry ! Dearly beloved ... We just need to take it more seriously . The séance was going great . Don 't you remember how light as a feather and stiff as a board Jefferson was ? - He 's still pretty stiff . And we were able to materialize a spirit from the beyond ... or at least from a trading card . Yeah . Poor guy . Can we take him in the back and kill him with a shovel or something ? Why am I bothering ? You don 't care about this . No . I care about the true spirit of the divine ! I care about the universal truth ... but being a magic super hero that keeps chasing the same guy ? It 's completely gay ! And that is coming from a guy ... that voluntarily has sex with men ! Well . So does this mean it 's over ? - Are we breaking up ? - I guess so . Do you want me to pack up my blackula hunter and leave quietly ? Come on , Byron , don 't be so ding-dong serious all the time ! Your Montel Williams neck pin is blinking . There is cosmic peril somewhere . No , no , answer it ! I guess I 'll just wait . It says that Dr. Venture and his entire family are in danger . Then there was something about hundreds of deaths . Like you care . No ! You old bag of sad ! / That I care about ! That 's the kind of cosmic ju-ju / I am interested in ! For I am , the Alchemist , seeker of truth ! And I am Dr. Orpheus , master necromancer ! And he is ... Jefferson Twilight , blackula hunter ! Do you , Ms. Dr. The Girlfriend ... take Mr. The Monarch to be your lawfully wedded husband ? To have and to hold ... in sickness , and in health ... till death do you part ? I ... Monarch , this is the Phantom Limb . - You are surrounded . - Dick move ! You have five minutes to turn over my girlfriend ... or I will destroy your ridiculous cocoon ... and all inside . / Ça , c 'est de la bonne soupe !

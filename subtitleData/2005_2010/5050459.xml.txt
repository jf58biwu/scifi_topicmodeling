 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 2 1 st century is when everything changes . And you 've gotta be ready . I 'm returning to the same spot . I do hope they 're here . I have to move carefully . Don 't want to frighten them . Now , then . They 're home . They 're here . My little darlings . You shouldn 't be here . Neither should you . What you got ? Funny sort of weather patterns . Bye . - Didn 't you see what the time was ? - I was on the phone , wasn 't I ? - Well , shall I call the school ? - Don 't be stupid . She 'll be all right . Ow ! - Bye . - Bye . - Who 's picking you up , Jasmine ? - Roy . Your mum asked me to fetch you ' cause she 's a bit late . I promised your mum I 'd fetch you , so get in the car . - Did you hear me ? - No ! Come away , O human child . Come away . - What exactly are we doing here ? - I had an invitation from an old friend . Here we go . Fairies ? Are you kidding me ? I suppose , I 'm one of the fortunate few who 's been allowed to see our little friends . And it 's been no easy task . One needs to have the patience of a saint and the blind faith of a prophet . But , for me , the long wait has been worthwhile . This is my first picture . Not that clear , I know , but the ring of stones can be seen quite distinctly . - I don 't believe this . - Shh ! Well , of course , I 'm not the world 's best photographer . But this little person is just about visible . I was so lucky to have seen them . So privileged to witness such a magical moment . Because fairies are shy , you see . But I know in my heart that they 're friendly , loving creatures . Thank you . Wrong . She always gets it wrong . - Estelle , when did you take these ? - A couple of nights ago . - Where ? - In Roundstone Wood . - Not far from here . - So good to see you again , Jack . Oh , look , there 's the wood . - What 's wrong ? - Jack and I have always disagreed about fairies . I only see the good ones . He only ever sees the bad . - They 're all bad . - No , I refuse to believe that . Well , I suppose one person 's good could be somebody else 's evil . That 's what his father used to say . Oh , Jack , if only you 'd seen them there in the wood . They were happy , they were dancing , their fairy lights were shining . Do you have any more photos ? - Yes , at home . - Right . I need to see them all . - Something wrong , mate ? - Sorry . Yeah , well , look where you 're bloody going . Got a problem , pal ? Oi , pick that up ! - Oh , God , help me ! Help me , please ! - All right , mate , just calm down . - Hey , hold on , you . - Just bloody help me ! All right , that 's it . - You crazy bastard ! - No , no , no , please . It 's coming . It 's coming ! - Where was she ? - Walking home on her own . - Jas , come here . - Do what your mum says . - You 're not my dad . - Just bloody well do what she says . All right . You must never walk home on your own . You understand ? It 's not safe . It 's all right , Mum , no one can hurt me . Oh , thank you , Jack . This is Moses . Hello , Moses . They 're mostly just pictures of the area . Come on , my darling , high time you went outside . This is you . Sorry , no , that 's my dad . He and Estelle were quite an item once upon a time . They were inseparable . Then why did they part ? It was wartime . He was posted abroad , she volunteered to work on the land . Just happened that way . If you don 't mind me asking , did you know Jack 's father after the war ? No , we lost touch . Why ? Did all three of you ever meet ? You , Jack and his father ? Oh , no , never . Jack contacted me a few years ago . I was so surprised . He 's so like his dad . Same walk , same smile . I hope he 's still alive . - He 'd be in his early nineties now . - You could always ask Jack about him . I have , but he doesn 't seem to want to talk about his father . Estelle , when you next see these creatures , you call us immediately . - Understand ? - Mmm-hmm . N ight or day , it doesn 't matter , just call us . And be careful . It 's important to me . - But , Jack , I have nothing to worry about . - Just be careful . Please . Estelle shouldn 't be living in town . She belongs in the countryside . - How often do you get to see her ? - We meet up now and again . - Whenever she 's seen her fairies ? - She calls them fairies , I don 't . - What do you call them ? - I 've never really had a proper name . Why not ? Something from the dawn of time , how could you possibly put a name to that ? - Are we talking alien ? - Worse . - How come ? - Because they 're part of us . Part of our world , yet we know nothing about them . So we pretend to know what they look like . We see them as happy . We imagine they have tiny little wings that are bathed in moonlight . - But they 're not ? - No . Think dangerous . Think something you can only half see , like a glimpse , like something out of the corner of your eye , with a touch of myth , a touch of the spirit world , a touch of reality , all jumbled together . Old moments and memories that are frozen in amongst it . Like debris spinning around a ringed planet , tossing , turning , whirling , backwards and forwards through time . If that 's them , we have to find them before all hell breaks loose . - Why won 't she play anywhere else ? - She likes it down there . Other kids have friends . Where 's her friends ? Must be something wrong with her . There 's nothing wrong with her . Well , when 's the last time you saw her watching TV ? Or reading a book ? Or playing with a doll ? Or sitting down to have a chat with us ? When 's the last time you heard her laugh ? Come away , O human child . Come away . This is the youngest girl and the girl 's cousin . - I blame it on magic mushrooms . - What you do in private is none of our business . - These photographs were fake . - Conan Doyle believed in them . - He was gaga at the time . - And Houdini ? - Self-publicist . - How do you know so much about it ? Because I wrote an essay on the Cottingley glass-plate photographs when I was at school . And when the girls were old ladies , they admitted they were fakes . - So where was this sighting , then ? - In a place called Roundstone Wood . Oh , I know it . Has an odd history . - How do you mean , odd ? - It 's always stayed wild . In the ancient times , it was considered bad luck to walk in there , even to collect timber . - Even the Romans stayed clear of it . - I 've had no report of any sighting . You won 't . These things come in under the radar . But they play tricks with the weather , so set up a program for unnatural weather patterns . - Right . - Are you saying our machines can 't pick them up ? Nothing can . What is it ? Is it God ? Somewhere safe , that 's all I want . Just put me somewhere safe . Got a right one here . - Look , they 're trying to kill me . - Said there were flowers in his mouth . - Flowers ? - They 're trying to choke me . - We checked . Nothing . - And they didn 't want to hurt that little girl . It 's just me . They just want to hurt me . They just want to kill me . - Who wants to hurt you ? - They won 't leave me alone . I 've done wrong . - What do you mean you 've done wrong ? - And if it 's God , I 'm sorry . - I can 't help it ! - Name ? It 's little girls . It 's their little bodies . It 's their little smiles . They 're as bright as buttons . Look , I 've been in trouble before , so just help me . Just lock me up ! Please . I asked Estelle about your dad . She said she 'd never seen the pair of you together . Why would she ? She lost touch with him after the war . I just happened to catch up with her later . Oh . The stones in those photographs . This whole area was forest in primeval times . Most of the development areas have been built on ley lines . - Anyone could 've made this circle . - Why do you keep doubting me ? I spell out the dangers , you keep looking for explanations . - That 's what police work 's all about . - This isn 't police work . - All right , then science . - And it 's not science . I know , you told me . It 's that corner-of-the-eye stuff . All right . JASMIN E : That 's a cat , and now it 's a tiger , a white tiger . And now it 's a horse , a white horse with wings moving through the forest . It 's looking at me . Tiger , tiger . Tigers can kill . Show me the tiger ... I heard you laughing , Jas . Seemed like you were talking to someone . Just talking to yourself , were you ? It 's lovely to hear you laugh . I thought I 'd seen everything in this game until now . We had him locked up , for Christ 's sake , on his own . He was shouting the odds when he was brought in , said things were following him . - What kind of things ? - Shadows , he said . He was going on about being choked . There were four other prisoners . They saw nothing . - Where are they now ? - Had them transferred . - CCTV ? - I 'm dealing with that . At first , I thought he was a drunk or a nutcase , or both . Right , I want this place locked off . - Name ? - Mark Goodson , worked in town , - business consultant . - Cause of death ? Well , going by the pinpoint haemorrhages on the eyelids and around the hairline , I 'd say oxygen deficiency , but it 's odd . There 's no fingertip bruising on the face , no areas of pallor . - Nothing to suggest that pressure was applied ? - Nope . Yet he suffocated alone in a locked cell . Looks like it . Wait a minute . Never seen anything like that before . I have . Quartzite , the searching stone . Oh , let the energies flow . Help me find them again . You know the dead man was a convicted paedophile . He used to hang around schools . - But why the petals in his mouth ? - Just a bit of fun on their part . - You call that fun ? - That 's the way these creatures like to do things . They play games , they torment , then they kill . - Why ? - As a punishment or a warning to others . They protect their own , the chosen ones . Somehow children and the spirit world , they go together . - So how do we stop them ? - First we have to find out who they want . And we can 't trap them , they have control of the elements . Fire , water , the air that we breathe , they can drag that air right out of our bodies . - Sometimes I think they 're part Mara . - Mara ? Kind of malignant wraiths . That 's where the word nightmare came from . They suffocate people in their sleep . - Yeah ? - Jack . - It 's me , Estelle . - What is it ? You were right , Jack , there are bad ones . - They 've come to me . - Estelle , we 're on our way . Stay where you are . Don 't go anywhere near them . Do you understand ? Yes . Moses ? God , Moses . Silly cat . Come on , Moses . Come on , darling . Moses ! Moses ! Come on . Come here , darling . Come on , puss . Moses ? Moses ! Oh , no . Oh ! It makes no sense . It 's a fine night , yet the weather map says there 's rain . Oh , God . Estelle ! Estelle ! Estelle ! Looks like she died from drowning . Rest of the garden 's dry as a bone . It wasn 't your dad that was in love with her all those years ago , was it ? It was you . We once made a vow that we 'd be with each other till we died . I need a drink . - Where did you and Estelle meet ? - In London . At the Astoria ballroom , a few weeks before Christmas . She was 17 years old and she was beautiful . I loved her at first sight . But nothing lasted back then . Promises were always being broken . Estelle . To have to die like that . Those petals in Goodson 's mouth , where had you seen that before ? Was that during the war ? No . Long before then . On a troop train . Fifteen men , with me in charge . Everyone happy . Too happy . Too noisy . Then we hit a tunnel . We thought some birds had flown in through an open window . Then came the silence . And when we came out of the tunnel , all 15 men were dead . They 'd been suffocated . My squad . Men I was responsible for . But why were the men killed ? About a week earlier some of them had got drunk , drove a truck through a village , ran over a child , killed her . That child was a chosen one . She 's a nightmare . Three hours , wouldn 't say a word , just sat there glowering - ' cause she thought I 'd nicked her special stapler . - Don 't worry about it . - You okay ? - No , I 've had a bit of a weird day , actually . Bloody hell ! What the hell 's gone on here ? How 'd they get in ? They smashed everything up , the bastards . I 'll fetch you straight from school this afternoon , Jas . You don 't want to miss our party , do you ? I 'd rather play down the garden . You 're right , she 's spending too much time down there . Don 't worry , I 'm gonna put a stop to things . So what are you gonna do when they start building at the bottom of the garden ? It 'll happen one day . Don 't you ever want to have a conversation with me ? No wonder your dad left when you were a baby . He must 've seen what was coming . - Who were you waving at ? - Just friends . You don 't have friends . All the boys in my class aren 't very nice size , mince pies , catch the buggers by surprise . TEACH ER : Jasmine . - Did someone push you , Jasmine ? - Yes , Miss . - Who ? - Don 't know , Miss . Come here . In the whole of my working life , I have never had to bring the bad times home with me . I have never had to feel threatened in my own home . But not any more . Because this means these creatures can invade my life whenever they feel like it and I am scared , Jack . What chance did Estelle have ? What chance do any of us have ? - You said these creatures protect their own . - Yeah . You mentioned the chosen ones . What are they ? How many are there ? Tell me , Jack ! All these so-called fairies were children once . From different moments in time , going back millennia . - Part of the lost lands . - Lost lands ? What ? The lands that belonged to them . - What exactly do they want ? Why are they here ? - They want what 's theirs . The next chosen one . - Hey , you ! Did you tell on us ? - No . - Yes , you did . - Yeah . Well , maybe you need a good kicking . Get those teeth of yours kicked in . I want a check on all unexplained deaths in the area . - What 's the weather forecast for today ? - Long sunny spells . It 's happening again . - I can 't understand it . It 's going crazy . - Just leave it . Let 's go . Hold on to me . I 've never seen anything like it . It was so sudden . Then it ... Then it just ended . - Kate , is it ? - Was anyone hurt ? No . Two children were almost scared to death , but they 're okay . - What is it ? - I saw them . And there was little Jasmine in amongst it all . She hadn 't been touched . The sun was shining down on her . It was ... It was like an aura , like something protecting her . - Who is Jasmine ? - Jasmine Pearce . She 's a pupil of mine . - Where is she now ? - We 're sending all the children home . We have to . Okay , thanks . - The chosen one ? - Yeah . All right , you made it . - Must 've been scary at school today . - It was fun . Roy said you saw some of your friends this morning . He said you waved at them . Only Roy said , when he looked , he couldn 't see anyone . - That 's because they were in the trees . - Trees ? - What trees ? - The trees along the road . - Is this one of your games , Jas ? - No . - Want another beer ? - Hey , come on . Come on . - So who are they ? - Just friends . - You should 've invited them to the party . - They don 't like parties . - I 'm not surprised if they live in trees . - Oh , they don 't always live in trees . They can be anywhere and everywhere . They can even be in this room . - In this room ? When ? - Now . Don 't be silly , Jas . Where did you meet these friends ? Must 've met them somewhere . They said they 'll always look after me , even through time . - When did they say that ? - I forget . Oh , yeah , got big plans for this place . Gonna extend the patio and landscape this garden . Come on , Jas , hurry up with that food . People are hungry . - So when are you gonna name the day , Roy ? - Oh , never . Can 't afford to keep her . No ! No , please , no ! - No ! - Jas , get away . - You can 't do that , that 's my own place . It 's mine . - I said , get away . Ow , Jas ! You little bitch . - That 's all we need . - Just a bit of bad weather . It 'll pass . That was good . - Where 's Jas ? - Oh , well , she 's around . Ladies and gentlemen . Ladies and gentlemen , can I have your attention , please ? As you all know , today is a very special day . Lynn and me have been together now for the past five years . And not only is she my partner , she 's also been my rock and my best friend . And now we 're looking forward to having children of our own . Oh , my God ! Come on , move ! - Go , go , go ! - Stay back . Come on . Go ! Roy ! Roy ! Roy ! Get off him ! No ! LYN N : Leave him alone ! LYN N : Roy ! No ! Oh , Roy ! No ! Do you know you 're walking in a forest ? Well , you are . It looks like a very old forest , and it 's magical . I want to stay in it . - You can see this forest ? - Yes . But it 's not here . It 's just an illusion , Jasmine . It is . Your friends are just playing a game with you . - The real forest can never come back . - Oh , it can . When they take me to it . They told you this ? But what about your mother ? Don 't you want to stay with her ? - Come on , the child isn 't sure . - I am sure . No ! Leave her alone . - Find another chosen one . - Too late . She belongs with us . - The child belongs here . - No ! She lives forever . - Jas ? Where 's Jas ? - Wait , wait . No . No ! No ! Jas ! No ! No ! Good God , no ! My daughter ! - Suppose we make her stay with us ? - Then lots more people will die . - They tell you that ? - They promised . Come away , O human child . Next time , they 'll kill everyone at my school , like they killed Roy and that man and your friend . - How do you know these things ? - If they want to , they can make great storms , wild seas , turn the world to ice , kill every living thing . Let me go ! The child won 't be harmed ? - Jack , you can 't ... - Answer me . She won 't be harmed . We told you , she lives forever . A dead world , is that you want ? What good is that to you ? There will be no more chosen ones . - They 'll find us , back in time . - They 'll find us , back in time . Take her . Jack , no ! You asked me what chance we have against them . For the sake of the world , this is our only chance . Thank you . Jas ! Jas ! Jas ! Jas ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Jas ! I am so sorry . No ! What else could I do ? Come away , O human child , to the waters and the wild with a fairy hand in hand . For the world 's more full of weeping than you can understand . Seventeen disappearances within the last five months . The rift is spreading , and it 's dumping aliens and psychos wherever it fancies . Where is everybody ? Tosh ! - Oh , my God . - You can 't fight them , they 're too strong . Help me ! Stop them ! - Oh , my God ! - How many people are there down here ? What did this , Jack ? It can 't be human . How far is this gonna spread ?

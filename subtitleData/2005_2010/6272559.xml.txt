Hey . Hey , is this the place ? I don 't think this is the place . Definitely not the place . I no go further . You no go ? You 're leaving us here ? Bad things in there . This is good stuff .

Trying to acclimatize , I guess ... the sounds , the shadows . Creepy , I know . Creepy , I know . What 's that ? A global positioning system . It should let me know exactly where we are . Great . So where are we ? Thanks . What 's that ? I don 't know . I 'm a little jittery . It 's all right . You do that as much as you like . You moron ! It 's not funny ! Ow ! That 's not funny !

Let 's take it on home . Let 's go . We 're in the jungle ! That 's it . It ? No more track . Well , so ... what do we do now ? We wait . What , we 're gonna wait here ? Looks like that 's the plan . We 're stranded . I can 't believe it . Well , keep up the good work . How long are you gonna wait . How long are you gonna wait before you tell him you 've got a lighter ? Five , maybe ten more minutes . He 's , like ... obsessed with it . I bet he 's , you know , a Taurean . stubborn and obsessive . You do horoscopes ? Yeah , sure . Like Sydney - she 's an Arian . True ? Wow , you 're good . Oh . Smart-ass . Oh . Smart-ass . See anything ? No . No , not really . Yeah . How could you ? Maybe we should get back to the guys . Maybe we should get back to the guys . Yeah . Did you guys hear that ? Yeah . What was it ? - It sounded far away but the echoes sorta ... - - -Sorta , yeah . I know what you mean . It scared me , too . Hey , guys , I 've got smoke ! I think I 've got smoke ! Wait a minute . Let me see . Wait a minute . Let me see . That is not funny . Why 'd you stop ? I saw smoke . It 's not funny ! Hey , guys ? Yeah ? Oh , my God . What is it ? Something 's there . What is it ? Keep still . Oh , my God ! Keep still . Oh , my God ! Keep still . Nobody move . Dani ? Yeah ? Camera . Why ? - Night vision . - - -Oh , my God ! Oh , man . Can you see it ? I see ... something . I can 't stop shaking . Oh , man . Keep still . I see something . Yaah ! Huh ! Um ... Um ... who are you ? I am Chenne . I with Professor Hamilton . The cavalry . About time . Come . Uh , wait ! When do we get to see Professor Hamilton ? When he is ready . Right . What do you think about Jungle Jane ? What do you think about Jungle Jane ? She 's something else . She 's definitely a bit of a ... Piece ? Greg , must you always insist on being such a prat ? Yeah . Good morning , students . I am Professor Hamilton . Breakfast is in ten minutes , and we leave in 40 . Leave ? Where to ? Leave ? Where to ? You 've hit the jackpot here . We have all hit the jackpot . A valley ... untouched , undiscovered . Flora and fauna ... unlike anything you have ever seen . Wait . I thought we were just gonna be here . Study the same things you see in your textbooks . Study the same things you see in your textbooks and your classrooms back at home ? Or ... you have the opportunity to write the new textbooks , to bring home the newly discovered specimens to those classrooms . Each one of you ... blazing new trails . It 's rare to go where no human being has ever gone before . Oh ! Oh ! These days men have to look to the skies and beyond to achieve that , but not us . We have that right ... here . So , chop-chop ! No time to lose . That had to be rehearsed . Had to be . Had to be . I don 't know if this is ... No , no , this 'll be cool . I don 't know if this is ... No , no , this 'll be cool . It 's like ... Aristotle . This is cool . What about you , O Quiet One ? You ready to blaze new trails and all that ? I don 't know . Do you ever get the feeling that you 're not getting the whole truth ? Hello ? Where are the others ? They told us there 'd be others , right ? Anyone else think that Professor Hamilton is a little , Anyone else think that Professor Hamilton is a little , you know ... strange ? And this camp . Is this base ? I mean , well , it 's like , where do they do all the work ? Guys , this is my first time here as well , you know ? They said there would be others . Yes , we heard you . So , uh ... you guys think that Professor Hamilton and that chick Chenne are ... ? And that chick Chenne are ... ? It 's not as if everybody else wasn 't thinking it . No , I was . I 'm just surprised you said it . Hey , guys . Hey ... anyone seen my cell phone ? No . Where did you last have it ? Where I just looked . What 's going on ? Syd 's lost her phone . No , somebody stole it . Hey , what 's the deal ? What ? Mine 's gone . Who 's nabbing phones ? I am . You stole our stuff ? I am . You stole our stuff ? Turn camera off . No . Now ! I don 't see why . Why should she ? Hey ! That was mine ! " Was " is the operative word . Can we please have back our stuff ? Nothing in that bag belongs to you . Chenne was obeying my orders . Now , the nature of your ability is not a concern . Your trust , however , is . I will not risk the leaking of any information I will not risk the leaking of any information while on this project . All right , listen up . Who 's missing ? Nice of you to join us . I want you to consider these your badges of honor . I want you to consider these your badges of honor . They 're dog tags before marching into battle . But , uh , sir , we already know each other . Sir . Oh ? This isn 't me . I 'm Greg . Ah ... Greg . How interesting . The rare blood type , Greg - OH . Seth ? Yeah . That 's me . These tags contain all the information needed in case of an emergency . But be sure you wear your own . Come , pick yours out . Pick out your name tag . Wear them . It could save your life . The jungle is not good for the complexion . The jungle is not good for the complexion . It 's so hot . And that 's five minutes . Everybody up . Oh , it 's beautiful , isn 't it ? Yeah . You 're gonna want to have that ready for this . There . Whoa ! Yeah , so ? It 's all uncharted . All unknown . All for me . For us . All for me . For us . How exactly do we get down ? That 's how we get down . Yeah . You have got to be kidding me . No way . No way . And so here the journey ends . You can 't expect us ... Aw , it 'll be fine . It 'll be fun . It 's important to push oneself in this life , especially now . With great risk comes great reward . Exactly . I read it in one of Josh 's comics . I 'm not going . I can 't do this . What are you gonna do ? Go back . Go back ? I can 't let you do that . You 'd be robbing yourself of a great opportunity . But I 'm not ... I am counting on you for documentation . Ah , perhaps , uh ... an introduction ? Hmm ? Sorry , guys , but ... You can 't not do it . You have to prove him wrong . I didn 't sign up for this . I am Professor Conrad Hamilton . I am standing on the edge of the Hamilton Crater . Situated below , a valley unspoiled , Situated below , a valley unspoiled , in its most pure and natural state . As it was millions of years ago , so it remains today . Have you gone through this yet , Professor ? Out and into this valley ? No . We will be the first . You are watching history , and each one of you ... will be living it . OK , guys , I 'll see you down there . See you down there ! I 'll be waitin ' for ya . OK , go . I 'm not looking forward to this . Come on in , the water 's fine . Oh , my God . This harness is ... riding up in places that I ... I 'm not sure if I 'm comfortable with this . I really need the bathroom . You guys OK up there ? You 're looking good from down here . Wasn 't so bad , was it , buddy ? Hey , just drop . I 'll catch you ! Oh , my God , don 't look down . Oh , my God , don 't look down . You just looked down ? No . Oh , crap . Man , I have never seen two girls coming down on me like this . Is that guy ever serious ? Would you want him to be ? Shut up ! Go . Go ! I can 't believe we just did that . Oh , yes . Whoo-hoo . Come on , Josh . Hey , come on , Josh , you can do it . Go on , Josh . Go on , Josh . - - You 're doing good . - -Come on . Come on , keep going . That 's it , buddy . Go on , Josh . Go ! Go ! Now ! Ow ! Let go of the rope ! Now ! Go ! Josh ! Josh , slow down . Go , go . Go now . Josh , just slow down ! Josh , just slow down ! Josh , let go of the rope and then you 'll stop . Help ! - - Let go of the rope ! - Just relax , man . Stop spinning . Slow down . Josh , slow down ! Help ! Oh , Jesus ! The bitch kicked me ! I 've really hurt my ankle . Let 's go . Let 's go . Pick him up or carry him , but we 've got to go . You can assist him when we make camp . We 're not gonna leave him here . OK , I got it . Come on , let 's get him up . You all right , Josh ? There 's your bag . Get your bag on . It 's all right . I 'll be fine . Josh , are you sure ? Ow . Oh , no . Ow . Oh , no . What 's this ? Headquarters . Base camp . Weren 't we supposed to be the first ones here ? Weren 't we supposed to be the first ones here ? Yeah , we were . That was the argument . This is where everyone else is ? This is where the others are ? Others ? You 're the others . While I shouldn 't have to explain myself , I admit that I twisted the truth a little , but I had to get you down here . But ... But ... No one else needs to hear this . Yes , myself and Chenne have descended into the valley before , but ... have descended into the valley before , but ... but we have yet to explore the outer limits . What about all those extra packs ? Whose are they ? Professor ? Huh ? Ah , yes . Yes . Um ... we 'll continue this later . Better ? Yeah . Yeah , much better . Thanks . She watches out for him . Yeah . Yeah , that 's good . Come on , seriously . I am . Serious . The guy is insane . You know I can 't use that . Why not ? You 're supposed to be documenting the truth . Why not ? You 're supposed to be documenting the truth . Yeah , but still . Hang on . Incoming , 12 : 00.What ? Behind you . Gather ' round . A little ... food for thought . Anyone know what this is ? It 's part of a skull . It 's part of a skull . Einstein . It 's not ... Can I see it ? - That 's weird . - - -What ? What is it , Syd ? It 's a monkey skull . Moving on . It 's definitely not a monkey . So ... human ? That thing ? Yeah , right . It 's ... I believe what Sydney is coming to terms with I believe what Sydney is coming to terms with is that she doesn 't quite know what it is . No kidding . But I should . But she should . I mean , aside from the distorted features , look at the cranium . The volume . Well , it 's like ... it 's like us . I mean , we 're ... 1,200 cubic centimeters in volume . Right . And this ... This has got to be at least ... Right . And this ... This has got to be at least ... 14 ? 15 . No , it 's gotta be about ... 1,800 cubic centimeters . When did this creature become extinct ? It isn 't . Stay there . Stay right there . Did you see it ? How big was it ? So I 'll just go ahead and be the one to say it . What the hell was that all about ? No . No . How did you catch it and then lose it ? You had it . It 's just me . You 've gotta watch that . What is that ? Chenne digging . Chenne digging . Now ? At night ? I think it 's for our benefit . It 's a grave . For that guy ? Yeah . They carried him out of the tent a while ago . Something 's not right here . Something 's not right here . I mean , we 're students , not professionals . Not yet , anyway . We 're not supposed to be in life-threatening situations . I get enough of that at student parties . Did you understand any of that skull stuff ? Yeah . Intelligence , well , evolutionary intelligence , anyway , can be sort of measured by the size of the skull . So ? So , we 're looking at a new species , maybe . Only I don 't understand why we 're here . Only I don 't understand why we 're here if he 's so protective of it . I know . Well , you know , Sydney and Josh were talking about going back tomorrow . She 's a little scared . Yeah ? But how ? I don 't know . She says she feels pretty confident she could find her way back . What about you ? Are you gonna go with them ? I was thinking about it . I was thinking about it . I 'm just ... starting to feel a little like ... A hostage ? Yeah . Come on , let 's go . They let him go . This was a warning . I 've gotta go . OK , I know this isn 't need-to-know , but ... I 've gotta go . I really ... need ... to pee . Hey . Who 's there ? Greg ? Come on , guys , this is private time . Get lost . Enough ! I 'm gonna waste you guys ! Hey , hey . Sydney left . Hey , hey . Sydney left . What ? Woke up , and she was gone . She wouldn 't leave us , even if she knew the way . Did Hamilton say anything ? No . Dead man walking . Come in or go away . Sit . Well , what is it ? Did Sydney come and talk to you this morning ? Which one is she , the brunette ? The blonde . Oh , yeah , her . Well , I mean , did she say ... ? Yeah , she did . Ah . So she left ? I mean , you let her leave ? Let her leave ? Why wouldn 't I ? It 's not like you 're in prison here . It 's not like you 're in prison here . I had Chenne escort her back early this morning . She came to see me . I explained what we were doing here . She was intrigued , but said she thought it was best she left . Homesick , she said . Really ? Yeah . It just seems kind of odd . What does ? Maybe she would have waited for the rest of us . Say goodbye . Maybe she would have waited for the rest of us . Say goodbye . Well , you know women . They get an idea in their heads ... And what ? What is it exactly we 're doing here , Professor ? You 're getting an idea in your head . You shouldn 't . I won 't tolerate mutiny on my crew , you understand ? I want you to rally the troops because we 're going in further . Truly uncharted territory , I promise you that . But Josh , with his ankle , there 's no way we can go into uncharted territory . He can stay , but the rest of you , the rest of you must come with me if I 'm to accomplish anything . Seth ... I 'm relying on you . Will you do this for me ? What did he say ? He said we need to move out . We need to pack up . We 're moving further in . But what about Syd ? We 're moving further in . But what about Syd ? He said he had Chenne take her back safely . So she 's gonna be all right ? Yeah . I 'm sure she 'll be fine . It 's just that I ... I didn 't think she 'd leave without saying goodbye to me . She wouldn 't . What do you mean ? Well , I just think Sydney ... Nothing . All right . Let 's move out . Let 's move . Hey ... you all right ? Seth , what 's going on ? He said you can stay here , hold down the fort . Alone ? No . N-No , I 'll cope . What do you think ? Yeah , we 'd best stick together . Seth ... Look , let 's just get going . But ... Look , I 'll think of something . OK ? Help ! Help ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me . Where are we ? Please . What are you doing ? Please don 't leave me . Help ! Help ! What is that ? It 's working . What is that thing ? Hold on . What about Sydney ? You took her back ? Yes , Sydney returned safely . She got back pretty damn quick . As you can see , Chenne moves pretty damn quick . But even so ... Prepare to move out ! Two minutes . Guys , we need to do something . I feel like ... Like bait ? What do you mean ? I don 't think it 's this place he 's so interested in . It 's what 's living here that he 's into . What are you doing ? Breadcrumbs , like markers , for when we need to get out of here ... without those two . For when we need to get out of here ... without those two . How are we gonna do that ? The gun . We gotta get the gun . If we do that , we do it tonight . What about Josh ? If we get the gun , we don 't need to worry about it . We can take our time with Josh . Move out ! This way . Ah ... Perfect . We 'll camp here . Pitch your tent there . Thanks . Do you want some water ? Ugh , flies . There 's millions of them . There 's heaps of them . Ugh . Right , mister . Let 's get you away from that mess . It 's like a warning . A warning ? It 's like a warning . A warning ? Yeah , that 's exactly what it is . It 's a warning for us . Come on . What 's that ? It 's nothing . Don 't worry about it . It 's nothing . Thank you . You really think it 's a good idea to stay here ? You really think it 's a good idea to stay here ? Yes , I do . Professor ! What is it ? Hush . Start talking . Yes . I suppose it 's time . I have uncovered a new species of primate , a completely separate branch of evolution , one that could possibly tie up the loose ends . The missing link ? How can you call it missing when it 's been found ? No . How can you call it missing when it 's been found ? No . This is an offshoot . They 've been breeding down here for thousands of years ? So what do you call it , then ? Them ? What does he call them ? Frankly , I just ... I don 't know . It 's been like trying to to prove the existence of Bigfoot or aliens . But all of this . Instead of waiting for them to come to us , we 've been going to them . We 've been going to them . You have that skull . Isn 't that enough evidence ? Only that they once existed . I want to prove they exist now . We need something more concrete , something ... That can 't be debated . Exactly . How dangerous are they ? Well , I should imagine that they 're only dangerous when their space is invaded , which ... is exactly what we 're doing now . No ! No , they 're not any more dangerous . No ! No , they 're not any more dangerous than any other animal in the wild . The fact of the matter , students , is that I can 't do this without you . If I had chosen assistants from academia , they 'd have wanted a share in the glory , but you , as students , you 're just as smart as they are , but there 's no chance that any of you . Will outshine me . No offense , of course . This is bullshit . This is wrong , Professor . This is wrong , Professor . You realize what 's gonna happen when someone finds out ? I mean , you 're treating us like prisoners , like lab rats . By the end of this , you won 't be telling anyone . You will be so enthused with the discovery and the knowledge that you 'll barely remember my little persuasions . Enough ! It 's time we all got some rest . Don 't you think ? This is so messed up . Sydney was right about all the other people missing . Sydney was right about all the other people missing . I don 't even wanna think about what happened to them . I 'll get the gun . Tonight , after everyone 's asleep , I 'll get the gun . Me too . No . It 's gotta be quick . It 's gotta be quiet . If there 's two of ... If there 's two of ... It 'll be easier if it 's just me , yeah ? Or me . I mean , it could just be me . Greg . Look ... if it 's you and something happens , I 'm not strong enough to carry Josh . Don 't worry about me . Don 't make it about me . I 'm not . But they 'd just wake up ... Look , I am just saying , OK , just in case , that 's all . Look , I am just saying , OK , just in case , that 's all . That 's why it 's gotta be me . Well ... scream or something if anything happens . Ah , yeah . Thanks . Nice touch , Greg . And , guys ... if it gets really serious , we can always use this . Look . It 's like Morse code . SOS ... without the dots . See ? Batman 's got one quite similar . Seth . Hey . Seth . Hey . Hey . Do you mind if I stay here with you tonight ? Just ... Dani 's with Greg , and I just didn 't wanna be alone tonight . No . I mean ... yeah , that 's fine . Thanks . Yeah . I ... don 't think anyone should be alone tonight , you know ? I ... don 't think anyone should be alone tonight , you know ? Yeah . Thank you . Tonight , those noises . What do you think they were doing ? I don 't know . It might 've been like another warning , maybe like some sort of call to arms or something . But , I mean , it could be anything . It 's probably nothing . But , I mean , it could be anything . It 's probably nothing . We don 't even know what we 're dealing with . You 're not scared , are you ? No . No , I 'm not scared . Good . I am . Are you gonna get the gun ? Now 's as good a time as any . Do you think they 're asleep ? No . We should probably wait . We should probably wait . I 'm glad you got such a big ... tent . I usually plan ahead for two . You 're such an idiot . Are you OK , Josh ? Can 't I just pitch my own tent ? Can 't I just pitch my own tent ? You know what I mean . I 'm not letting you go anywhere . I 'd be fine with it , really . I just keep thinking about Sydney . Well , now that ... I mean , who 's to say they didn 't ... ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . Just the rain . It is not my foot . That 's gross , Josh . Stick it outside . What ... ? That rain 's urine . You 're kidding me . Come on , Greg . It 's true . Some animals piss on their prey . Wicked . Watch out , Josh , they 're marking you . Wicked . Watch out , Josh , they 're marking you . Yeah , out of 10 , I get 11 . Josh ! Guys , Josh has gone ! What ? ! They took him ! What about Greg ? ! He 's gone after him ! Wait , wait . Dead or alive , I want one . Greg ! Josh ? Josh ? Josh ? Greg ! Help me ! Josh ? Josh ? Oh , my God ! Help ! Josh , I can 't see you ! Josh , where are you ? Josh ? Josh ? Josh ? Josh ? Josh ? Josh ? Josh ? Josh ? Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! Josh ! - What the hell ... ? - Ow , my ... You son of a ... Why ? Why 'd you shoot me ? Oh , God ... Oh , God , it hurts . Why shoot me ? Why 'd you shoot me ? Why shoot me ? Why 'd you shoot me ? Oh ! Why ? What 's wrong with you ? Why are you ... ? Why ? What are you doing ? Why ? What are you ... ? Why are you ... ? What 's going ... ? What 's going ... ? Oh , you bitch . Why ? No . No . No . Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! God , help ! God , help ! No ! No ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Greg ! I have to go help ! No , no , no ! I have to go . Please , no ! No ... What are you doing ? I have to go help him ! You can 't leave me ! I have to go after him ! I 'll be right back ! No ! No ! Go . No ... Shh . God , help . You ... You will not go to them . It hurts . Please help . Oh , God ! Help . Help . Oh , God , help . Help ! Help ! Help ! Oh , God ! Chenne ? Chenne ! Chenne ! God ... Oh , God ! Chenne ? Chenne ? Chenne ? Che ... ? You used us all as bait . This place , you knew how dangerous it was . This place , you knew how dangerous it was before we got here , and still you told us to come . You must understand . No ... I don 't . You are so young . You have a lot to learn about ... About what ? Desperation ? Insanity ? Failure ? Failure ? I am just about to succeed . Don 't you realize what 's being discovered here ? What 's being discovered ? They 're killing us ! What 's being discovered ? They 're killing us ! You 're ... killing us . You think they 're just gonna let us walk outta here , stroll outta here so you can put ' em in a cage and put up a big sign ' round them ? I expected some casualties . Everyone understands sacrifices . Do they ? Well , we 'll see about that . Do they ? Well , we 'll see about that when I get back and I explain to everyone how you sacrificed a 20-year-old girl for your precious discovery . You get that ? Yeah , I get it . Listen . What ? Someone 's coming . Greg.Seth. Ah ... Wonderful . Where 's Seth ? Where 's Seth ? Greg . Where 's Greg ? Where 's Seth ? Gone . Everybody 's gone . Oh , Seth . Oh ... Seth . Is it on ? Can we go ? Yeah . Tonight , our expedition , led by me , Conrad Hamilton , led by me , Conrad Hamilton , was attacked by a new breed , an intelligent species that has so far killed at least five of our members . We are being stalked , hunted , toyed with , but we stand resolved . Tomorrow , we begin again . Three of us remain , and three of us will continue ... Wait ! What ? You can 't be serious . Yes ! Of course . We 're so close to achieving our dream . Our dream ? Our dream ? We have to get out of here now ! No ! You will not ! Keep on recording ! The three of us will continue our quest to find this new breed . And we will endeavor to bring back evidence to the outside world that these incredible creatures exist ! She should be right around here . Who ? Your friend Sydney . What is that thing ? A tracking device . A what ? Are you serious ? Someone knows we 're here ? Don 't get excited . We 're the ones doing the tracking . Sydney shouldn 't be too far off now . Why aren 't you recording this ? Why aren 't you recording this ? What is the camera for ? Record it ! We are close ! We are very close ! Did you plant a device on one of them ? On one of them ? No . On all of you . What ? I can 't believe you . They got hold of Sydney , didn 't they , and you let them ? How could you ? Science . That 's how I could . That 's why I did . She should be right ... right around ... She should be right ... right around ... Oh , my God ... Ah ... Oh , my ... Ah ... Girls . - -Girls . Get this . I can 't . Yes , you can . They did this . They did this . They did this . This ... is beyond intelligence . This is imagination . And they are my discovery . Mine . Professor Con ... Good . Right , let 's go ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! He was tracking something . It was Sydney 's tag . He needed it to get them to come to him .

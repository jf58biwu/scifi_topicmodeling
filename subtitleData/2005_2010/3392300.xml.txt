 - What are you transporting ? - Human liver for transplantation . Paper work and license , please . Where are you delivering it ? Willow 's Memorial Hospital . They 're expecting it there . A patient wait for it . Have you ever procured or delivered an organ outside of normal or lawful channels ? No . You 're an employee with this company . How would your employer answer this question ? He 's sick . Has cancer . That 's not what I asked you . Am I under some kind of suspicion ? ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) A vision , if ever I had one . May I speak with you ? Would you like to come in ? Make yourself comfortable . I won 't be staying long . Have you come here by yourself ? Yes . Sit . Please , I insist . Now , you came to ask something . ( CLATTERING OUTSIDE ) We 're alone . Free to speak in confidence . You said something to me the other night in the snow . Yes . I said , " Don 't give up . " I need to know why you said that . I haven 't the faintest idea . Were you hoping for another answer ? Do you know anything about me ? Other than that you loathe me ? Do you know what it is that I do ? No . I can see you 're a woman of faith . But not in the same things as your husband . He 's not my husband . - Do you care to tell me about yourself ? - No ! Do you care to offer a confession ? - I don 't think you 're ... - What ? In a position to judge ? And yet you 've judged me , haven 't you ? You deserve to be judged . Do you know why we live here , the men who call this vile box of monsters home ? Because we hate each other , even as we hate ourselves , for our sickening appetites . That doesn 't make it any less sickening . And where do they come from , these appetites , these uncontrollable urges of ours ? Not from God . Not from me . I castrated myself when I was 26 . And the visions weren 't my idea , either ! - Proverbs 25 : 2 . - What ? God 's glory to conceal a thing , but the honor of kings to search out a matter . Don 't you quote Scripture to me ! What are you doing here ? What are you afraid of ? " Don 't give up " ! What was that for ? - I don 't know ! - I don 't believe you ! I 'm telling you the truth ! - They were your words ! - I don 't know why I said them . You said them to my face ! All I ever wanted was to serve him . All I 've ever wanted was to serve God . You can ask for his pity , but don 't expect mine . You can stop the act anytime ! Look at me ! ( GRUNTING ) ( DOGS BARKING ) ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) ( ALARM BEEPING ) ( SHUSHING SOOTHINGLY ) ( DOGS BARKING AGITATEDLY ) ( EX CLAIMING ) ( GASPING AUDIBLY ) ( BARKING VICIOUSLY ) ( SCREAMING ) SCULLY : Paramedics are here now . They 've been here for about seven minutes . Yeah , he 's stabilized . Blood pressure 's normal . - No , they 're loading him in now . - What happened ? Thank you . He had a seizure . - Who called you ? - No one . Then what are you doing here ? We need to talk to Father Joe . Well , that 's not gonna happen . We 've got a suspect . A Russian émigré working as an organ transporter . - In custody ? - No . The Richmond DA questioned him about trafficking black market human organs this afternoon , but he was released . They had no evidence to hold him . We 've got a fairly credible witness who says he swam with the women at the pool . ASAC Whitney ? - Excuse me . - What 's that got to do with Father Joe ? - It 's the man in his visions , Scully . - Who ? The suspect . The man in this photo . Mulder , now you 're wasting their time . Tell me again what you 're doing here . Here 's a vision for you . A couple of my guys just had it . MULDER : Who 's this ? That 's our suspect 's employer . An old friend of Father Joe 's , we just learned . - Known him over 20 years . - Known him how ? That 's one of his 37 altar boys . Three guesses who he 's married to in the state of Massachusetts . Our suspect . We got a warrant to search their offices . Mulder . It 's over . - Hey ! Hey ! - What ? - Hey ! - Mulder ! ( AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING ) Why don 't you hold up ? Let these men do their jobs . Clear this bottom floor . We were all fooled on this . I wanted to believe it as bad as anyone . Look , I don 't need the sweet talk . - You led us here . - Father Joe led us here . This is Special Agent Drummy with the FBI ! We have warrants to search these offices ! Anyone inside , identify yourself and unlock the door now ! I called you in because I thought you could help me with this case , because I valued your belief in these phenomena . Now what do you think ? I think this is a longer conversation . DRUMMY : Down on the floor ! Down on the floor ! Anybody here , I want down on the floor ! Somebody find the lights . We were at a complete standstill and you pushed us forward , no matter the direction we took . Hey ! WHITNEY : Hey ! ( HORN HONKING ) DRIVER : What are you , nuts ? Hey ! Stop him ! MAN 1 : Hey ! You can 't go there ! MAN 2 : Whoa ! Hey ! ( CLATTERING ) - Quick ! Which way did they go ? - Down that way ! - Mulder ! - I 'm up here ! Mulder ! He 's coming at you ! Hey ! - Mulder ! - Yeah ! - Where are you ? - Right here . Where ? ( GROANS IN DISGUST ) Fox ! - Where is he ? Do you have him ? - No . I lost him . - I saw him . - Where ? ( SCREAMS ) They 're both dead . Monica Bannan and Dakota Whitney . I heard . I 'm sorry . Yeah , well ... I thought we were winning , Scully . I know you did , Mulder . I 'm here to see Father Joe . I want to show him these photographs of these men . You still want to believe him . I think you should know that he 's been diagnosed with a terminal illness . He has advanced-stage lung cancer . I just want to be sure . Then let me ask him . You wouldn 't believe ... I was thinking of you . I had a vision you might find interesting . Of a man speaking a foreign language . Did he happen to look like this ? Yeah . That 's the man . How did you know ? We think he 's the man who abducted the FBI agent and the second woman that you say you saw , and possibly many more . And we think that he was helped by this man . - I don 't know who that is . - Are you sure ? I 'm fairly certain . I don 't know him . I 'm fairly certain that you do . And that you 've known him since he was a boy . Oh , no . It can 't be true . I don 't believe this . He was my connection to the girl . My visions were to save her from him . This is God 's work . This is God 's work . Let me ask you one more question , Father Joe . ( SIGHS ) The FBI agent , the first woman that you saw , Monica Bannan , is she still alive ? I feel her . Yes . She 's still alive . - Mulder . - That second victim may be alive . Everybody 's given up on her , but I 'm not going to . Mulder , you think I don 't understand , but I do . This stubbornness of yours , it 's why I fell in love with you . It 's like you said . That 's why we can 't be together . ( MAN SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN ) ( BOTH ARGUING IN RUSSIAN ) ( SHOUTING ANGRILY ) Whoa , hold up . Hey ! - Hey ! Sorry to bother you . - I 'm closed ! No , I just need a moment of your time . You know , we got some bad weather coming in . You better get where you 're going fast . So what do you need ? Yeah , I was wondering if you carry an animal tranquilizer called acepromazine . - You got a prescription for it ? - No , I don 't . Well , I can 't sell it to you , then . Can you tell me if you 've ever sold any to this man ? ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) - I am never getting out of here . - I 'm just ... MAN : Nutter 's Feed . Yeah , I was just closing up and I 'm gonna pick him up . Yeah . Goodbye . Yeah . - What happened to the other guy ? - Who ? The guy who was standing right here . I need to refill this now . ( SIGHS ) Okay . ( DOGS BARKING ) ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) - MULDER : Yeah , it 's me . - Shit . I must be busy right now . Leave a message . Mulder , I just found something in my stem cell research . Experiments being done in Russia on dogs , Mulder . I think that 's what your suspects have been doing , only on humans , those women who 've been abducted . You 've got to call me . Mulder , the FBI agent 's alive . ( GRUNTING ) ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) FBI , Special Agent in Charge Fossa speaking . It 's for you . This is Special Agent Drummy . SCULLY : I 've been trying to find you for hours . I can 't reach Mulder . - Is this Dr. Scully ? - Yes , it 's Dr. Scully . - Well , where is he ? - If I knew that , I wouldn 't be calling . Dr. Scully , I 'm gonna suggest you call the police . This is not an FBI matter . Listen to me ! I need your help ! I 'm sorry , I can 't help you . Then let me talk to somebody there with some balls who can . ( METALLIC CLANGING ) ( DOGS BARKING ) ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) No ! Don 't touch me ! No ! ( SCREAMING ) Don 't touch me ! You 're going to be fine . ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) I 've taken care of it . I 've taken good care of it . You don 't need this one anymore . Okay . ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) Look at me . You 're going to live . You 're going to have a fine , strong body again . ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) ( DOGS BARKING ) ( DOGS SNARLING ) ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) ( DOGS WHINING ) ( DOG WHIMPERING ) COP : Excuse me . I 'm Dana Scully and that 's my car . Right . I talked to some bigwig down at the FBI . Called from Washington . Yeah . That 's him . Walter Skinner . Is there any indication what happened or any footprints ? Nothing . Snow 's pretty heavy . But we did find this . Might want to give it to him . Excuse me . Here 's his cell phone . It 's got blood on it . Hey , listen to me . Calm down . Stop and think . He 's okay . He 's got to be . Now , he climbed out of there somehow . And if he climbed out , he probably climbed up . ( DOGS BARKING ) ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) Stop what you 're ... Stop . Back off ! Back away ! ( STAFF CLAMORING IN RUSSIAN ) Back off ! Back off ! Do you speak English ? Anybody speak English ? I want her out of here ! I want those tubes out of her neck , and I want her neck sewn up ! Do it ! Do it ! Are you gonna do what I said ? ( MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) ( MULDER EX CLAIMS ) ( GROANING ) ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) ( SIGHS ) We will find him . I know Mulder . He 'd get to a phone and call first . He didn 't do anything crazy . Not overly crazy . Wait a minute . Back up . Just stop . Back up a sec . Stop . What is it ? Proverbs , 25 : 2 . The glory of God to hide a thing . I 've got it . It 's an invoice for medical supplies to a Dr. Uroff-Koltoff . It 's an address on BelIflower Road . ( DOGS BARKING ) Maybe I can Google it . - Listen . - What ? ( BARKING CONTINUES ) Dogs . Dogs ! Hey ! ( WHISPERING ) Mulder . Can you hear me ? Sorry about your car . The girl is still inside . ( MAN SPEAKING URGENTLY IN RUSSIAN ) Show me your hands ! Show me your hands ! ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) Put the scalpel down ! Put the scalpel down ! Put the scalpel down , or I 'll blow your goddamn hand off ! Get over there ! Oh , my God , what have you done ? What have you done ? Mulder needs warm clothes and fluids . Oh , God . I 've got work to do here . Get in ! Get in there ! ( PEOPLE CHATTERING IN RUSSIAN ) All right , Mulder . The girl , inside ... Scully 's got her . She 's in good hands . - Skinner ? - Yeah . I 'm cold . I got you . I got you . - Mulder ? - What 's up , Doc ? Father Joe is dead . He was clearly a very sick man . Did you see this story ? The FBI is claiming Father Joe was an accomplice . Not a word about his psychic connection . He 's dead , Mulder . We 'll never know . I know , Scully , and I can prove it . Father Joe died of lung cancer , right ? The same as that man Dr. Frankenstein tried to give a new body . Mulder . And what time did you pull those tubes from that woman 's neck ? What time did you cut off the blood supply to that man 's head ? That 's when Father Joe died . You get me his death certificate and I 'll show it to you , and then I 'll take it to the FBI and I 'll show them . Do you think they 're really gonna take your call ? It 's an injustice to the man 's name . Well , considering his crimes against those young boys , who is really going to care ? I thought you believed him , too . I wanted to believe him . I did believe him . I acted on that belief . Why don 't you just tell me what he said to you ? He told me , " Don 't give up . " And I didn 't . And it saved your life . ( VOICE BREAKING ) But I 've put that boy through hell . And I have another surgery scheduled for this morning because I believed that God was telling me to . Through a pedophile priest , no less . What if Father Joe 's prayers were answered after all ? What if he were forgiven because he didn 't give up ? Try proving that one , Mulder . I 'm due at the hospital . Scully ? Why would he say that ? " Don 't give up . " Why would he say such a thing to you ? I think that was clearly meant for you , Mulder . He didn 't say it to me . He said it to you . If Father Joe were the devil , why would he say the opposite of what the devil might say ? Maybe that 's the answer . You know , the larger answer . What do you mean ? Don 't give up . Please don 't make this any harder than it already is . It 's okay . Okay . ( SOFTLY ) If you have any doubts , any doubts at all , just call off that surgery this morning . And then we 'll get out of here . Just me and you . As far away from the darkness as we can get ? I 'm not sure it works that way . I think maybe the darkness finds you , and me . I know it does . But let it try . ( SIGHS ) Are you ready to begin , Dr. Scully ? Yes .

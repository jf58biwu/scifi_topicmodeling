Do not lose heart . Though outwardly we are wasting away , Inwardly , we are being renewed day-by-day For our light and momentary troubles ... Are achieving for us an eternal glory , That far outweighs them all . For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens For God has given us the spirit as a guarantee and as long as we are at home in the body We are away from the Lord We walk by faith not by sight And so fix our eyes not on what is seen But on what is unseen . For what is seen is temporary . What is unseen ... Eternal .

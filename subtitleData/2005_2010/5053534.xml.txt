 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 2 1 st century is when everything changes . And you 've got to be ready . I 'm Bilis , the manager . Get out , Gwen . It 's a trap ! Open the rift now and the whole world could suffer . You know , it 's rude to stare . I thought telepathy would get you to make me a cuppa . - What 's it worth ? - What do you want ? I 'll draw you a diagram , shall I ? N ice arse . Don 't answer it ! - Yep . - You watching the news ? WOMAN ONTV : There 's speculation that the incidents overnight may be linked . Initial reports suggest a terrorist involvement , but this morning some intelligence experts have claimed the incidents may be a stunt . The first sightings were of UFOs over the Taj Mahal in India . They came in just after midnight . In London this morning , there were reports of men in historic dress firing upon police . Down , down , down . Some religious groups are claiming events overnight are a vindication of their teachings . Do you think it is terrorists ? Terrorists bomb things . This is different . People didn 't believe us . Now they should . Judgement Day is finally here . This is the End of Days . " And I heard but did not understand " and I said , ' Master , what is the end of all these things ? ' " And he said , ' Go , Daniel , for the things are closed up and sealed until the end of time . " ' Daniel 12 , verse 10 . Sounds a bit close for comfort . This machine 's on the blink . Keeps losing power . Sorry , don 't let me stop your portents of doom . Or have you finished ? No . Plenty more where that came from . Abaddon , the Great Devourer , who 'll lead the world into shadow . Yeah , thanks , Ianto , I can do without the superstition . You people love any story that denies the randomness of existence . Thanks . That makes me feel a lot better . Okay , I 've been fielding calls all night , the government , U NIT , the CIA . Half the Western world and a good proportion of the Eastern are all asking the same question . Is this anything to do with us ? And is it ? I 've run a profile on every reported temporal anomaly and tracked any physical or temporal pattern . Shit . The cracks in time trace back here to the rift . This city , this H ub , is the centre . What you 're seeing around the world are ripples and aftershocks . - The rift is splintering because of you . - What ? You opened the rift without knowing what you were doing . You 've caused the temporal cracks to widen . Time is seeping through . If it wasn 't for me , you two would still be in the 1940s . So are we gonna sit around crying into our lattes or are we going to do something about it ? Bring those who 've fallen through time back here , into the vaults . And do what with them ? We 'll deal with phase one first , then I 'll tell you about phase two . You can 't control time , you can 't send them back . - What are you gonna do ? - We 'll think of something ! Hey , this is not the end of the world . I 'm certain of that . Priority one attendance requested at the hospital . Mortality rate 's gone through the roof . They 're sealing off the area and designating a hot zone . - I 'll go . - Tosh , go with him . No , thanks , I 'm fine on my own . And you 'll be even better with me alongside . Shut up and come on . Did you have to pick on him in public like that ? All of our actions have consequences . And all your staff have feelings , Jack , even Owen . Well , you would know . He brought you back . Would you rather be stuck in World War II ? Hello ? Gwen , it 's Andy . Listen , I didn 't know who else to call . Double murder . Stabbed two blokes in Penarth . Brutal , it was . No mercy . What are we supposed to do ? He doesn 't speak a word of English . And he 's dressed as a bloody Roman soldier ! He 's not dressed as a Roman soldier , he is a Roman soldier and he 's shouting in Latin . - Only word I could pick out was Gelligaer . - Gelligaer ? There 's a Roman fort out in Gelligaer . Built around 75 AD . So he was on his way there , time splintered and he ends up here . Excuse me ? H i , any time you feel like talking sense ... - That soldier came through a crack in time . - He 's not serious , is he ? This sort of thing just doesn 't happen . Not in Cardiff . Just because you can 't understand it , doesn 't mean it isn 't true . I know it sounds mad , Andy , but ... All right , Mulder and Scully , say I do believe you , which I don 't , ' cause it 's bollocks , but say I do , how exactly are we meant to handle a prisoner from 2,000 years ago ? Has he got the same rights as anyone else ? How 's this gonna work with the CPS ? We 'll take him off your hands . Under any other circumstances , an exuberant Roman soldier would be my idea of a perfect morning . Careful , Jack . Everyone 's saying it , you know . In work , on the streets . Do you think this is the end of the world ? Oh , Andy , don 't be silly . Do you think the world 's gonna end on your shift ? I 've seen you use that smile on a lot of people . - What smile ? - The smile you use to reassure people when deep down when you know everything 's going to shit . This was the first one to die . No ID on her , she just appeared in the middle of AE . Nobody saw her come through the doors , she didn 't register at the desk . So what happened ? She started coughing up blood , we moved her into isolation immediately . An hour or so later , the staff started presenting similar symptoms . Which were ? Bite-like bumps on the skin , chills , fever , headaches , along with black patches on the skin . Indicating bleeding into the skin and possibly other organs . From the staff , it started spreading to other patients who 'd been in reception when she came in . These aren 't contemporary clothes . Her teeth aren 't exactly modern style , either . Shit . As soon as we realised the rate of infection , we closed down the whole area . How many others are infected ? - 30 , maybe 40 . - All quarantined off ? We think so . Have their clothes and their sheets destroyed immediately . - What is it ? - That woman isn 't from this century . More like the 14th . It 's the fucking Black Death , Tosh . She 's infected Cardiff AE with the plague and it 's my fault . The team are instigating procedures . The infected will need 30 milligrams of streptomycin and chloramphenicol plus two of tetracycline . That 's plague medicine . Standard issue for bubonic . Well done , House . That 's what you 're up against . So what are you gonna do now ? Well , you 're a hospital . You 've got procedures , haven 't you ? Yes , but everybody said Torchwood would sort it out . What if we get more carriers appearing out of the blue ? We 're working to stop that . We waited for you ! You 've got to stop this ! You 've got to do something ! No , you 've got to do something . People are dropping through time , and they are gonna bring every disease in history through your doors . - So you 'd better be ready ! - Owen . You scared enough yet ? 'Cause fuck knows I am ! Come on , Tosh ! Make sure they get the medicine . Call us if things get worse . How much worse can they get ? Owen ? Owen ! Tosh . Come on , stop pissing about ! If Owen managed to open the rift to get you and Tosh back , can 't we do the same for these people ? We 've still got the Rift Manipulator . There 's a world of difference . We 're talking about taking control of time , not bringing two people back from the past . Besides , look at the damage Owen caused . We mess with it further , we 'll put the whole planet in danger . Have I ever let you down ? Gwen ? Gwen ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Gwen . Gwen ! Come on . H ustle . Are you sure it was the same guy ? It was definitely him . Bilis the caretaker at the dance hall . That 's all he said ? Sorry ? What 's he got to be sorry for ? Coming through ! Thirteen more reports of Weevils on the loose . We 're not gonna keep up at this rate . - Everything 's on the increase . - Can we stop them from making that noise ? - If you 've got any ideas how . - Maybe they 're time-sensitive . This disturbance may be too much for them . We 're now full in all vaults across all nine levels . Do you want me to activate the vaults below ? It 's just we 've never used them since I 've been here . Do it . Gwen , maybe you 're right . Let 's run a search on your dance hall buddy . - We need to find him . - Okay . Hello , Ianto . What do you want ? Why are you here ? This isn 't happening . There 's only one way to stop this before things get worse . People will die , Ianto , thousands of people , unless you open the rift . Owen . How was the hospital ? Laugh a bloody minute . They 've got an outbreak of the Black Death . What ? Oh , my God . Have they got it under control ? Tosh ! How are they coping ? Owen got the place quarantined and organised treatments for those who 've been infected . Only consolation is it 's treatable these days . But , you know , what happens when the next carrier comes through , Jack ? Someone carrying smallpox or Ebola or something from the future we don 't even know about yet , what do we do then ? Well , it 's not doing us any good standing around speculating . We need to be prepared . We 're helpless , all we 're doing here is putting sticking plasters on gaping wounds ! What do you suggest ? I suggest you lead us and you tell us what the instructions are . - Owen ... - No , come on . You 're all thinking it , too . You 're the big man here . You keep all the secrets ! Well , now 's the time to tell us a few and tell us how the hell we 're going to get out of this ! You want to know a secret ? There is no solution . I can 't fix this . Because this was never meant to happen . The first thing you learnt when you joined Torchwood was don 't mess with the rift . But you disobeyed those orders and now everything that 's happening is down to you . I only disobeyed instructions to get you back ! - And now people are dying . - What , so I shouldn 't have bothered ? Who the fuck are you anyway ? Jack Harkness ? You don 't even exist . We 've looked . So if you 're not even a real person , then why the hell should I follow your orders ? Get out . - What ? - Get out ! I 'm relieving you of your duty . - No . You can 't do that ! - Bollocks you are ! Jack , wait . You 're done here . What , so that 's it ? The whole world is going to shit and you 're gonna fire me ? For God 's sake ! Both of you ! We need to stick together on this . If I can 't rely on you , if I don 't have your complete trust , you don 't belong here . That goes for the rest of you . Anyone who agrees with Owen , leave now ! So now we know how it is . So that leaves me 24 hours to savour the good times . What are you talking about ? Think about it , Gwen . Nobody leaves this place intact . Some time in the next 24 hours , I get retconned . All my memories erased . I don 't know where or when , but he 'll get me . Jack , this has gone far enough . Well , I guess this is goodbye . Good luck with the end of the world . I would say thanks for the memories . Jack , for God 's sake ! Okay , guys , Bilis ' shop is coming up 20 metres on your left . Wow . Some of this stuff must go back centuries . He scavenges antique pieces from the past , brings them here , sells them for a profit . Not a bad business plan . We all have to earn a living . - You 're from 1941 . - As you were . Hello , again . How can you be in two time zones at once ? I can step across eras , like you 'd walk into another room . At first , it was the most incredible gift . Now I know the reality . It 's a curse . Why ? I can see the whole of history , but I don 't belong anywhere within it . So , your return to this time had a price . Time 's splintering . This city exists on a rift in time . The only way to make it right is to fully open that rift . Let it suck back what fell through . - No way . It 's too dangerous . - Can we even do that ? Of course you can . Isn 't that right , Captain ? - Jack ? - You 've seen what happened . If we open that rift fully , millions of lives will be at risk . And yet if you don 't , more will fall through . Lives will be lost . - You know so much , you 're coming back with us . - I 'm sorry . Damn it ! Trace the temporal activity round this location . We need to find out where he is . Come on . Gwen . I am not your enemy . In the cells , why did you say you were sorry ? Sometimes it 's better to live in ignorance , unless ... Do you really want to know ? Know what ? Hold my hands . I 'll show you . - Okay . - Only if you 're sure . I 'm sure . I 'm sorry . - What did you just show me ? - The future . What took you so long ? Gwen ? Gwen ! Is that you ? Yeah . It 's me . - You 're cleaning the oven ! - Aye , somebody got to , love . We got to go . - Why , what 's happened ? - We 've got to go , that 's all . - Let me finish here first . - Rhys , we 've got to go now ! Oh , here we go again , look , always a hurry with you , ever since you started that bloody job ... I 'm sorry . Owen . Owen . No ! Jesus . Diane . - Oh , Jesus . - I 'm lost , Owen . I can touch you . I don 't understand . - Where did you end up ? - Please , bring me back , Owen . - You can do that , can 't you ? - I don 't know . - Everything 's out of sync . - Please . Please , bring me back . Open the rift . Do you want another drink there , mate ? Whoa , whoa , take it easy . What 's going on ? Am I dreaming ? This is where I work . - You work in a prison ? - These are just the cells . You locked me in a cell ? What the hell are you playing at ? I was just trying to keep you safe . - I was safe at home ! - No , you weren 't . You really weren 't . Listen here , Gwen , you better tell me exactly what 's going on . 'Cause I 've taken some shit over the past few months . - I mean , what 's all this ? - Rhys , listen to me , I need you to trust me . Okay , it may not seem like it at the moment , but I am just trying to take care of you . I love you , sweetheart . What the hell was that ? Just try and relax and I 'll come back for you . What do you mean ? Hey , you 're not going to leave me down here ! - I 'm sorry . - Gwen ! Gwen ! - I 'm sorry . - Shit ! - Did he wake up ? - Yeah . Yeah , he did . Tosh , can you bring up the CCTV of the vaults ? Just leave it on the screen , I know it sounds crazy but ... Sure , no problem . Thank you , for helping me bring him here . I can 't understand how Bilis was able to show you that vision . It was so real , Tosh . I was in my flat . It smelt like my flat , it had all the sounds of my flat . I touched the blood . I can still feel it on my hands . Rhys ' blood . It 's not gonna happen . Come on , there 's still work to be done . - What 's going on ? - We 've got a security breach . All right , nobody panic . Rhys ! Oh , do you work here ? I 'm Rhys , Gwen 's boyfriend . No ! Rhys , please , please , God ! Please , God ! No ! We can bring ... We can bring him back ! - There 's nothing we can do . - Yes , there is ! My boy , what am I gonna do ? What am I going to do ? No ! I 'll have to tell his family . We 'll deal with it . The way you dealt with that porter first time I met you . No , you won 't deal with him , Ianto . Gwen , I 'm so sorry . You never even met him . This is what happens here . We all end up alone . Not me . No way . You bring him back . - No . - The resurrection gauntlet ... Was destroyed . - We 've got to have something else . - I said no . No , there 's something wrong with time so we can go back - to the moment , to the very moment ... - Gwen . Well , there 's got to be something that you can do otherwise what 's the fucking point of you ? You , you bring him back ! You bring him back ! Bring him to me ! You bring him back ! Do you understand me , Jack fucking Harkness ? - Do you ? - I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . Oh , shit . - What happened ? - You came back ! Are you all right ? You okay ? Are you all right ? Don 't touch me ! How many other people have got to suffer ? I 'm gonna fix this . I 'm opening the rift . Make sure you stop him . No . We 're gonna help him . Bilis was right . He said , " Open the rift and everything goes back to normal . " Owen 's right . I 'm going to get Rhys back . - Gwen . - No ! Gwen ! Enter Emergency Protocol One . Out of the way , I 'll do this . Get away from the computer , Gwen . This is a trap . All these cracks around the world , they 're diversions . This is what Bilis wants . What are you afraid of , Jack ? Rhea Silva . I said move . - What the hell are you doing ? - Final warning . Come on , Jack . You 're a united front now . Toshiko , the poor girl who 'll screw any passing alien that gives her a pendant ? Owen , so strong , he gets in a cage with a Weevil , desperate to be mauled . Ianto , hiding his Cyber-girlfriend in the basement . Your three comrades here pumped bullets into her , remember ? I 've got to get Rhys back . Yeah , ' cause you 're so in love with Rhys that you spent half your time in Owen 's bed . Fuck you ! We 're relieving you of your command , Captain ! We 're opening that rift and getting back what we lost ! - Shit ! - Stay down ! You wanna be in charge , Owen ? You got to have significantly bigger balls . I 'm sick of people doubting me . What have you done ? We 've still got to do Jack 's . Oh , my God . What have you done ? Help me move him ! Quick ! Go ! - Keep moving . - Right , Jack ... everything is going to go back to normal . From out of the darkness , he is come . What is he talking about ? Son of the Great Beast , cast out before time , chained in rock and imprisoned beneath the rift . What ? All hail , Abaddon , the Great Devourer . Come to feast on life . The whole world shall die beneath his shadow . I look upon you , my God , and know my work is done . How do we stop it ? Tell me what to do , Jack . Just you , get me to an open space . What are you gonna do ? If Abaddon is the bringer of death , let 's see how he does with me . If he feeds on life , then I 'm an all-you-can-eat buffet . No , wait ! Wait , you 're too weak ! Get out of here , go ! Drive as fast as you can . Jack . Bring it on ! - You 're here ! - Weren 't you just here a minute ago ? You 're here . Go to bed . Get some sleep and I 'll be back for you . You 're certain ? He 's ice cold . No vital signs . He survived when you shot him . When I first joined he said he couldn 't die . He was wrong . I want to sit with him . - Gwen ... - I want to sit with him . Wake up . Jack . How long is she gonna do this ? It 's been days . We have to face up to it . He 's not coming back . I believe in him . Let him go , Gwen . Thank you . - I 'm ... - I forgive you . What 's happened to the rift ? It closed up when Abaddon was destroyed . But it 's gonna be more volatile than ever . The visions we had . We all saw people we loved . What did you see ? Nothing . There was nothing . Jack ... what would have tempted you ? What visions would 've convinced you to open the rift ? The right kind of doctor . Jack ... Where are they with those coffees ? Jack . Jack ? - Did you see Jack on your way in ? - No . I thought we tidied up in here ! What 's the matter ? He was just here . Something 's taken him . Jack 's gone .

 MYKA : What kind of artifact could cause a gas explosion ? PETE : I thought we were gonna get a break . Did you ask Artie ? Yeah . He laughed for about five minutes . ( LAUGHS ) I guess that 's an answer . You know , I 'm not asking for two weeks in Tahiti , you know ? I just want a couple days to get out of Podunk , Dakota , and go someplace that serves martinis . Well , you are looking pretty ragged . You got those bags under your eyes and ... What ? I 'm supporting you , here . It 's very helpful . Thanks . Ow ! MYKA : Secret Service . That 's a big-ass generator , huh ? Mmm-hmm . PETE : I count six body bags . Excuse me , can I see this body , please ? Oh , God . Kentucky Fried , extra crispy . Thank you . Can I help you ? Hi . I 'm Agent Bering . This is Agent Lattimer . Captain Powell . Secret Service ? What went down here last night ? An underground gas main ruptured . It ignited . City engineers are checking to see if it 's safe to go down there . Until then , that 's all I know . Thanks for stopping by . Hmm . I think I have more questions . You ? Let 's go meet the engineer . Let 's . You get through ? Hello ? Hey . It 's us again . Look , General , I 'm going to need a list of all the casualties and a list of all the witnesses to the accident . Well , it 's pretty much the same list . Half a dozen suspects haven 't even been processed yet . All right ? We 're still trying to confirm the IDs . And I wasn 't here , but a desk sergeant and a duty officer got knocked out by the blast . One 's comatose and the other one 's in surgery . I 'm sorry to hear that . Good . So maybe now you 'll let me get to the ton of paperwork I have ahead of me . Hey . So , what do you think ? Is it safe to go down there ? Yeah . There 's not much to see , but it appears to be structurally sound . Mmm . It 's dark . Thanks . Okay . PETE : So , this must have been a cellar they sealed up when they built the police station . MYKA : Uh-huh . Huh . You got a vibe ? No . Something else happened . Check this out . The explosion must have blown this door open . Pete ? ( GASPS ) Wow . I guess he 's been down here quite a while . Yeah . Secret Service . Myka . Uh-huh ? This guy was a Warehouse agent . MYKA : Look , he has a Secret Service star , but his ID and his credentials are dust . I 'm sending for the body right now , okay ? And meanwhile , what I want you to do is I want you to get me pictures . Meanwhile , I am going to find who this agent is . I 'll ID him and I will find out , if I can , what mission he was on . It looks like the blast opened up the wall , and somehow , people were fried . I mean , could an artifact cause an explosion like that ? Or did the explosion release the artifact and then burn everybody up ? Well , that is a very good question , Pete , very good question . That 's exactly what you have to figure out . Bye . How the hell ? How the hell am I going to figure out who that mysterious agent is ? Unfortunately , the Warehouse filing system never quite caught up to the computer age . Like your wardrobe . Yeah , could ... What ? These are earth tones . They never go out of style . The files on all the Warehouse agents for the last 200 years , give or take . And missing agents , too , somewhere . Excellent . You can teach me about scrapbooking . Yeah . Okay , I 'll call you if I need you . All right , all right , I 've got my own stuff . Besides , I 'm allergic to old . ( BEEPING ) Hey , Myka just sent pics from the scene ! ARTIE : Yeah , no , we 're getting the actual body later today , so we don 't need that digital crap . Digital 's just as good , Artie . No , you know what ? Welcome to the new millennium . Pixels will never replace the real thing . Pixels , you know what they are ? They 're just ... Look , they 're a start , but they 're ... God , they 're a really small start . But they don 't have to be . What ? They can be so much more . I 've been working on something , okay ? I really want to show you . No , I really , really don 't need any kind of newfangled ... Chill . This is totally old-fangled . Check it out . What ... What ... What is ... Is that ... Is part of that a Bell + Howell Spectroscope ? Surprise . I repurposed it . What ? Without asking me ? What ? It 's just a hologram projector . It 's perfectly safe . Now behold ... No . No . I don 't need to behold . Can we behold a whole other time ? See , I 've composited all of Myka 's pictures , and ... Wait . No . No , no , hold on . No , I know this works . Yeah . I 'm sure it 's fabulous . Can we just do this at a more appropriate ... Percussive maintenance . Wait , it gets better . What did you ... What did you do ? CLAUDIA : I upgraded the whole megillah . Strung together a bunch of Haswells on a Cray XT backbone I found in the Warehouse . I mean , I guess keeping me around here wasn 't the worst idea you ever had . What is that ? Is that a tattoo on what 's left of his skin there ? Could be . Can you zoom in a little ? Okay . Yeah . Yeah , I can 't ... I can 't ... Could you digitally reconstruct that ? Couldn 't any genius whiz kid ? Okay , you do that . I 'll be in the records room . " Really brilliant job , Claudia . Love the initiative . " " Oh , thank you . Thanks , Artie . " So , nothing on the tapes , like I said . You know , I 'm really enjoying our time together . These are the personal effects from the suspects who died in the accident , right ? Yeah . And processing them has a very low priority right now . Yeah , but whoever started the job put out seven trays . Yeah ? There were only six bodies . Son of a bitch . Son of a bitch . Everybody , drop what you 're doing right now . Which means we might have a survivor or a witness . Or a guy with an artifact that fries people . Reggie Hinton , where are you now ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ( LAUGHING ) Look , buddy , give me some of that . Reggie ? Shut up . We gotta get out of here , y 'all . Now . He 's coming after us , all of us . Who is ? Just come on , y 'all . We gotta get out of here , now . Reggie ! Wait , Reggie ! Let 's go . DONNY : Reggie , who is this guy ? REGGIE : It 's him ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) MYKA : It 's consistent with a fast , hot fire . The same as the bodies in the station . Except this time , no gas leak . Looks like they were microwaved . POWELL : We ID 'd this one as Reggie Hinton , your suspect . What killed these guys ? Why is this not ... CLAUDIA : Okay , it 's an eagle . ARTIE : Yeah ! And an anchor . Uh-huh . And just a circle , I guess . Could it be a globe ? Yeah . Why not ? Okay , so , eagle , anchor , globe . He 's a Marine . He 's a Marine . That 's gonna narrow it down . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) I mean , there 's only like a dozen or so agents that were former Marines . So , you know , we can ... Yeah . There are more bodies . They 're burned to a crisp again , but there 's still no sign of an actual fire . No fire ? Wait a minute . No fire . Okay , so , there was ... There was some Babylonian battery . It was unearthed and then lost again in 1952 in Texas , not Missouri . But there was also a rumor that Edward Teller was working on a micro-fission thing , but I don 't think that that ... Well , here 's a wrinkle . There 's a handprint on the bodies . It 's the only part not burned , and our only suspect was one of the victims . It was like he was , I don 't know , followed from the police station , Artie . No , no , no . Not like he was followed . He was chased . I don 't think that these deaths are random . So , maybe somebody at the station last night found the artifact , whatever it is , and used it to settle some old scores . Yeah , okay , you know what ? You trace the victims , you see if they 've got any enemies , then maybe you can get ahead of this guy before he settles more scores . Okay ? Bye . Yeah . If that 's what it was , which I doubt , you know . Would it have killed you to leave a note ? Captain Powell . Yes ? Did you know that every one of these burn victims were members of the same gang ? And they were brought in the other night after an altercation with a rival gang . I mean , could this be payback ? That 's just what we need , a turf war with a new kind of weapon in play . Okay , we 're gonna need names , addresses , whatever you 've got . The head of our gang unit , Sergeant Clark , is out on leave . As soon as I get in touch with him , I will put him through to you . PETE : And this is Clark , huh ? Until then , this is his latest stuff . Will you need a blue-and-white escort ? No , no , we can handle it . Good . ' Cause I really can 't spare one . I think he 's starting to warm up to us , you know , a little . I can 't ... It 's not ... Your uncle staying the weekend or just the night ? ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , he just arrived . This is actually the missing agent . It 's a little bit better than a hologram or pixel , isn 't it ? If you 're into that kind of thing . Yeah , well , you know , I 'm trying to scan it with this dingus you made , and I can 't connect it ... Hold on . May I ? Seriously . Yeah , well . Just do that , but go slower . All right . Wow me with your 3D . Hey , I don 't appreciate the tone , young man . Yeah . A little speed would be good . People are actually dying . Yeah . Go . Nice . Okay ? This is what I 'm saying . Wow . Okay . So ... He 's kind of cute for an old-timey guy . Okay . Okay . No . No . No . No . Welcome back to the Warehouse , Jack Secord . Joined the Marines in ' 48 , recruited to the Warehouse in ' 55 . Last known location , Minneapolis . That 's a long way from St. Louis , Louis . Five , four , eight , four . Here , put these on . What are we , going into surgery ? Just do as you 're told , please . CLAUDIA : Okay . ( RUMBLING ) Oh , Jack Secord , living quarters , personal effects , sealed 6l22l62 . Holy Bed Breakfast , Batman . This is Leena 's . No , no . This is the Warehouse , but yes , it is Room 5 of the Bed Breakfast , but still the Warehouse . See , whenever a Warehouse agent , if he disappears or if he dies ... Hey , are you listening to me ? Yeah . If he dies mysteriously , then , you know , living quarters , personal effects , they 're collected , they 're preserved right here . So he smoked . A lot . Hey , it was the ' 60s . Everybody smoked . What 's this ? What 's what ? " I 'll be in town in a few days . Until then ... " Are there envelopes ? No . So , there 's no addresses ? No . Maybe he thought somebody was reading his mail . Well , you know , it was the Cold War , probably somebody was reading his mail , but girlfriends weren 't against the rules , unless ... Wait , girlfriends ? Yeah . It 's female writing . See ? You can still smell the perfume . Oh . So , was that like an old-school booty call ? Yeah , before there was texting , grasshopper , there was a time when people actually did put pen to ... You know what ? That 's the ticket . Here , you know , it 's not what he got , it 's what he actually wrote . The indentations left behind . Oh , sweet . Yeah , product of a misspent youth . And that is ... Rebecca . And where do you live , Rebecca ? Is that St. Louis ? Yeah . St. Louis . Well , what do you know , Jack Secord ? You actually did leave a note . Rad . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Rebecca Saint Clair ? I 'm Agent Lattimer . This is Agent Bering . We 're with the Secret Service . Oh , my . How can I help you ? Would you mind if we came inside ? Well , sure . Thank you . Ma 'am , we 're just in the middle of an investigation , and a body was found today . A body ? Yes . In the personal effects of the deceased was this address . Oh , my God . You found Jack . PETE : So , you knew him ? Jack Secord , yes . I knew him quite well . Where did you find him ? PETE : Well , he was ... He was sealed up underground . MYKA : We 're very sorry . Do you remember if he mentioned any strange occurrences before he went missing ? Jack really didn 't talk about his work . Is this connected with that awful thing that happened at the police station ? No . Yes . ( CLEARS THROAT ) We 're really not at liberty to say , but if you have anything , if you know anything , no matter how seemingly insignificant , it would be very helpful . Would you like some tea and cookies ? No . Yes , please . ( STUTTERS ) Yeah ... I ... Yeah ... I just ... I love cookies . He does . Let me put on a kettle . Okay . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . What are you doing ? Establishing a rapport , you know , making her feel comfortable . I think she knows something . ( GROWLING ) Is that a vibe or do I hear your stomach growling ? I haven 't eaten since last night , okay ? Unbelievable . Unbelievable . Those look great . Thank you . The tea will be here in a minute . Thank you . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) I 'd just like to ask you , when his body was found , was there anything strange about ... Agent Bering . PETE : Good cookie . What ? When ? What 's the address ? Thank you . Pete . It happened again . Same condition ? Uh-huh . Okay . I 'm sorry , ma 'am , but we 've got to go . Thank you so much for everything . I 'm sorry . Just ... I won 't ... MYKA : Pete , don 't take them all . Okay . That one is ... Have more people been electrocuted ? Listen , we 're very sorry , but we really can 't talk about it . Thank you . PETE : Thank you . BOY : Let go of me . OFFICER : Take it easy , kid . Don 't touch me , you stupid pig . Stop . Take it easy . Watch yourself . Just don 't kill me . Okay , look , we 're not here to hurt you , okay ? We just want to ask you a few questions . No . The cops that killed him are going to kill me , too . What do you mean , " like him " ? Like who ? The killer guy . Are you saying a cop did this ? Five-0 walked right up and started burning people . I was just over there . I don 't know , it was crazy . What 's going on ? Who 's this ? Some witness . He says a cop did this . Yeah ? They never say that . He 's probably covering for a gang he wants to join . Hey , get the hell out of here . Look , have all of your officers checked in after the explosion ? No . But only Clark is out , the head of the gang unit . Why ? Because he needed to decompress . He lost his temper in an interrogation . So , these bodies , these gang members , fall under his jurisdiction ? Well , of course . But like I said ... He 's on RR . Right . He 's on RR . Right . Could we get his address ? We could use his expertise . Give me a second . So , the volatile lead of the gang unit is on mandated leave . While gang members get mysteriously killed by what looks to be a cop . What do you think ? Two plus two equals four ? Have you ever stopped by the office on your day off ? No , but I 'm sure you have . Hmm . Sergeant Clark and I call it dedication . ( ELECTRICITY BUZZING ) ( MAN GROANING ) PETE : You hear that ? Look at that . Sergeant Clark , federal agents ! Open up ! One , two , three , go ! PETE : Sergeant Clark ! Hey , hey , hey , Clark ! MYKA : Oh , my God , what is that ? Clark , no ! Come on . PETE : He went down here ! There ! He 's dead . Help me . That thing , it 's gone . ( SIGHS ) Go ! ( SIREN WAILING ) Okay , just tell me that Clark 's body is on the way to me right now . No . Powell took it . For God 's sakes . You know , I just don 't have time to play bureaucracy games to get it back . Well , I sent you a bunch of pictures that Claudia asked for . Yeah , great , pictures . Got them . There was something on his back , Artie . Some kind of a nasty metallic lobster-Iooking thingy , and it 's gone now . Okay , so , maybe , you know , if we find out what that thingy was , then we can track where it went . And you say that it also leaves a body when the body dies , maybe . Okay , that 's a good start . Please , tell me that you have something else . Well , it looked like it was fused to his back . Okay . Hold on , hold on , hold on . I got an idea . Yes , let 's do it right now . Now . Come on . Come on . Right . Right away . Just do it . One , two , three . ( EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST ) Go do your thing . Do your thing . All right , talk to me . It gave off arcs of electricity . It must be how he burned those people . You got it ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . All right . So , the electricity , did it emanate from Clark or from the artifact ? Both . Okay , you know what ? So that just eliminates our last possibility . All right . Just ... Did it have buttons ? Did it have wires ? Did it have an antenna ? Hey , Artie . Yeah ? Digital rendering shows Jack had something on his back , too . Okay , just ... All right , can you guys hear me ? MYKA : Yeah . PETE : Yeah . Okay . Attached to the vertebra at T2 , 4 , 7 and 9 and accesses the spinal cord , I think . I can 't really tell . Listen to me . Jack Secord , when he died , did not just have this artifact with him , he had it on him . I mean , this thing was like some kind of a ... It 's like a parasite . Well , dude , Ripley 's Believe It or Not , same markings on Clark 's back . ARTIE : All right , did you get that ? Clark 's back , too . PETE : So , what powers it , Artie ? I mean , it must be drawing electricity from somewhere to electrocute people the way it did . Yeah , okay , I 'll just add that to our already-huge list of questions . Thank you . All right . Goodbye . What ? Why are you making that face ? What ? You got something ? Electrocution . That 's the word Rebecca used , but we didn 't know it did that yet . We hadn 't figured it out . Oh ! Mmm-hmm . I see more cookies in my future . Of course you do . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You asked if there were any more electrocutions . What exactly did you mean by that ? I heard it on the news . No . It was never mentioned in the news . Ma 'am , you know more than you 're saying . Okay . Let 's cut to the chase , shall we ? You didn 't come in from D.C. The unexplained electrocutions raised a flag . You found Jack , and you finally figured out there was an artifact . You 're from South Dakota , right ? ( SIGHS ) This artifact that Jack was hunting for before he disappeared , it 's active again . Am I correct ? You weren 't just his girlfriend . You 're a Warehouse agent . Welcome to the conversation . Okay . Come here . I mean , this is it . Ew . Oh , that 's definitely a nasty lobster-Iooking thing . And what is ... It 's electrocution , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Wait . What was that writing ? This one . Okay . See , this ... This writing is very old . I have no idea what that writing is . You want me to , you know , scan it in ? Do my thing ? You go , girl . Don 't . Sorry . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Wrong . You left before I could be certain you were Warehouse . I wanted to share this with you , what I dug up back then . What I think Jack was following . There 'd been several unexplained deaths , burned bodies . It started at a museum shortly after an 11th-century exhibit passed through . I couldn 't find a connection . But Jack had vibes about these things . Very annoying . He must have started to investigate , and then ... Then he just disappeared . I always knew if we didn 't quit , one of us , one day , would lose the other . But , for Jack , the Warehouse was his first love . Till death do them part . I scoured the crime scenes , but I never found any answers . You never went back to the Warehouse ? I couldn 't do that . Changed my last name , just disappeared . I stayed in St. Louis , hoping to find him one day , maybe lost , confused . Eventually , my life was here . Myka , does this look familiar to you ? That 's what we saw on Clark 's back . That 's the device . REBECCA : That 's Jack 's handwriting . Jack knew what he was looking for . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Are you still using that old thing ? ( LAUGHS ) Yeah , right ? Okay , can you see this ? This is what you 're looking for . It 's called the Spine of the Saracen . Okay . Great . So it has a name . What is a Saracen ? Saracen 's a Turk . Now listen , there 's a legend that during the first Crusade the Turks had this elite warrior-cult . And these warriors were rumored to be unstoppable , for some reason , in the field of battle . What I 'm thinking is that this Spine , can you see this ? The Spine was specifically designed as a weapon for these warriors . Eleventh century , it 's the same as the museum exhibit . What exhibit ? Well , we found pictures , too . Something happened at a museum exhibit that Jack Secord stumbled on . Rebecca showed us this . So , maybe this thing was sealed and it got out somehow . Okay , so , if we find it , how can we stop it ? Yeah , okay . Well , I 'm deciphering the text right now . It 's a little difficult , but I 'm trying . It 's the words under this drawing and , loosely translated , it says , " The Spine requires a lifetime commitment . " Oh , yeah , I had a girlfriend like that once . ( LAUGHS ) So , this thing must get its power from somewhere , right ? So , if we shut down its source , can we stop it ? Yeah . Well , you know , when I figure it out , you know what ? You 'll be the second to know . So this Spine , you know , it 's probably still at Clark 's apartment . So we should get there before somebody else finds it . Now , Jack was a very good agent , the best . You be careful . Yeah , we will . Okay , so the last time we saw Clark alive , he ran into this alley . So we should start here ? Well , unless you want to look under the arch . ( GUNSHOT ) WOMAN : No ! No ! What is that ? Help me ! Help me ! Hey ! Hold it ! Hey , hey , hey , hold it , hold it , hold it ! He 's trying to kill me ! Bring the gun here ! I shot him ! I shot him in the chest and he just kept coming at me . Who 're you talking about ? He 's ... ( GRUNTING ) Okay , now would be a good time to take the shot . Okay , that didn 't work . Pete ! No , but the good news is we pissed him off ! Okay , stop it . We 're on your side ! Please , help me ! Please , help me ! ( GASPING ) Vince ! What happened ? Is he ... He 's gone . He was my ex-husband . There was a restraining order , but I 've never seen him ... Wait , it 's gone . ( WOMAN EXCLAIMS ) MYKA : But how ? Ma 'am , get out of the area now ! Now ! Pete ! Do you see it ? No . Do you ? No . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( RUSTLING ) Look out ! ( SCREAMS ) Pete ! Pete ! Pete ! Oh , my God ! Pete , don 't move ! I 'm okay . Okay , just let me call Artie ! All right ? Just let me ... No , stay away . I don 't want to hurt you ! ( SCREAMS ) POWELL : Agent Bering ? Agent Bering ? Agent Bering ? Are you okay ? Where 's Pete ? I don 't know . He 's not here . What happened ? Same thing that happened to Clark and Jack , it 's happening to Pete . I have to go find him . Hang on a second . You were knocked out . We need to call an ambulance . I 'm fine , okay ? Just excuse me . I have to go . The Spine was designed for one thing . It turns a person into a killing machine . It 's a warrior-maker . It uses the body like a big battery , heightening and redirecting the host 's natural electrical impulses . Yeah . It 's like ancient PCP . It jacks up your adrenaline and testosterone , so on a scale of one to 10 , you 're about a 25 . ARTIE : Until the battery is drained . Then the bars retract . It lies dormant , just waiting for the next nearest living host to latch onto . Artie , the Spine is on Pete . Okay , where is he right now ? I don 't know . Just tell me that you can remove it . ARTIE : We will . We will . Just ... There 's a way . There 's always a way , Myka . Artie , listen to me , I can 't ... I will not lose another partner . The look in Pete 's eyes , Artie , he looked ... I 've never seen him so angry . That 's not Pete . That 's the artifact . It 's just ... It feeds on aggression . It makes you go after what you hate , right ? Clark went after the gangs and the last victim went after his ex-wife . A warrior that 's been programmed to kill his enemies . Jack fought it . He fought his feelings long enough so that he could seal himself up and not hurt anyone . What are you saying , Myka ? You think Pete is going to do exactly the same thing ? I don 't know . Artie , what do I do when I find him ? What have you got , Claudia ? Just tell me anything you 've got . Okay , hold up . So , when this thing was built , electricity didn 't exist yet , right ? Right . So it zapped people , but what would happen if it got zapped ? I mean , that 's what the bolt of lightning was in the picture that they found . Remember , Jack wrote , " Hand of God . " " Hand of God . " Maybe that 's what shuts down the Spine , a bolt of lightning . Bolt of lightning . Overwhelming the spine 's receptors might make it automatically detach . That 's not bad . Just turn the Tesla 's power to full . No . Artie , look , we already tried that . All right , listen . Myka , find Pete . Your Tesla 's not strong enough , so you 'll have to find a powerful electrical source , somehow , somewhere . REBECCA : He 's going to take a bullet . What ? That 's what we 're trained to do , isn 't it ? Every Secret Service agent will take a bullet for the President , for his country . That 's what Jack did . He sacrificed himself . That 's what Pete 's going to do now . No . Because Pete knows that the Spine will just latch onto another person . Then he 's going to make sure . That 's what Jack did . ( KNOCK AT WINDOW ) Agent Bering , your partner , Lattimer , two of my men just saw him headed back to the station house . What ? Why would he ... The generators . He 's found his bolt of lightning . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO ) ( SIREN WAILING ) Lattimer . Lattimer ! Stop ! Get out ! Captain , wait ! Wait ! Look , it channels anger , okay ? You have to go outside . Please , just go . Pete , it 's going to be okay . Okay ? Artie can fix this . The Spine requires a lifetime commitment . You can 't help me . Yes , I can . Okay ? You just have to ... No ! I can feel it ! This thing is stronger than I am . I don 't think I can fight it much longer . Yes , you can . Yes , you can ! Okay , we can find a solution . We can lock you up until we find an answer . Like Jack ? Buried for all those years to have that thing come back to life ? No ! It 's gotta end here . I have to die . And I have to take the Spine with me . You understand , right ? Pete ... Take these and clamp them to the Spine . ( CRYING ) I tried , but I can 't reach . If I miss , I 'll just kill myself and it 'll attach to its next victim , Myka . You 've got to do this . ( CRYING ) Pete , I can 't . Please ! Please . ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANING ) Pete , listen to me . Pete ! You will come back . Do you hear me ? You will . Do it . ( SCREAMING ) ( PANTING ) Come on , Pete . Don 't leave . Come on , Pete . Come on ! Don 't leave ! ( GASPS ) Oh , God ! ( GASPING HEAVILY ) Are you okay ? ( LAUGHS ) Yeah . I 'm okay . God ! PETE : ( SIGHS ) Man , this trip really killed me . Could you not ... Could you stop that , please ? Seriously , I am totally dead . Yeah , I 'm surprised to see you alive . Don 't ... Don 't encourage him . I have but one life to live for my ... Oh , no , wait . All right , you know how I felt when you were actually close to ... Artie ? So , when you ... Oh . This is Rebecca . Right , right . Wow . This is quite an honor . Hello , I 'm Artie . Hello . Absolutely . I can take care of that . ( RATTLING ) Place hasn 't changed very much . Yeah ... I 'm working on that . Claudia Donovan , Warehouse 13 , next generation . Thank you very much , Claudia . Thanks . Oh , I ... Well ... Okay . Thank you . So ... I was wondering ... We could always use an extra pair of hands . " Use , " that 's the perfect word . Like I said , this place hasn 't changed very much . And it never will . It hates to let go of anything . Thank you , but no , thank you . I came here to complete Jack 's mission . Now , I 'm going home . ( CLAUDIA CLEARS THROAT ) I understand . Oh , right . Rebecca , there is one last thing that you might be interested in seeing . Just like he left it . His lucky lighter . Oh . Rebecca , there 's something in here , in Jack 's desk that Claudia found that obviously belongs to you , so ... ( SIGHS ) " Rebecca and Jack . " Together forever . " Yeah , I 'm going to give you a minute here . I guess Jack chose you over the Warehouse after all . Get out of here , while you have time . While you still have a life left to live . This place , it 's like the Spine . It 'll use you up .

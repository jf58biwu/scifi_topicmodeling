Everyone has a destiny , and mine is just over that horizon . Krayt , listen to reason . The elders all say it 's just a never-ending ocean of desert out there . Oh , pishposh . What kind of cruel god would create a whole planet defined by just one topographical feature ? Why , that 'd be as ridiculous as a whole world made of nothing but ice , lava , or forest . No , sometimes you just have to dig deep down inside yourself and find the courage to say , look out , world . Here comes Krayt Dragon . What is thy bidding , my master ? My bidding ? How about I bid thee to stop ramming the ship into funcking asteroid fields ? Can you handle that ? - I 'm trying . - Yeah ? Well , there is no try . There 's do and there 's fucking up royal .

Up ! - Yes , I c ... - No , I 'm here . Right . Oh , and be sure to mention some kind of a reward . What ? Oh , I don 't know . How much do you think ? Really ? That seems a little high to me . No , I see your point . I tell you what , why don 't we just say " substantial reward " and leave it at that ? Okay , thanks , Sheila . What ? Sure . What 's his name ? Dengar ? Sounds good . Yeah , no , we 'll bring him in first thing . Okay . Okay , bye-bye . Sheila 's husband 's a bounty hunter . I told her we 'd give him a look-see . Bet that knee 's starting to hurt . Sally Johnson is a real person , not an actor , so to tell her story , we hired the star of " Phantom Menace " . I was driving down my street when a truck hit me head-on . Osa-noes ! There 's a truck a-comin ' ! We 's-a gonna die ! Yes . I was fine , but the car was totaled . Whoo-ee patootie ! It 's a mess ! Got the engine over here , but the wheel for steering ' way over there ! My agent at Gecko lnsurance sent me a check right away . You-sa not even gonna believe this . Ja wheh . We win da money . We win da money ! Um , I think I was explaining it better than he was . Gecko Real help Real money Me-sa thinks me broke me bombad spine ! Did ... did they say cut ? Bounty hunters ? We don 't need their scum . My brother 's a bounty hunter , Gareth . There will be a substantial reward for whoever captures the Millennium Falcon . Is he paying attention ? Can 't wait to get started , right , fellas ? Got to hunt that bounty , but the bounty 's in the hunt , I always say . Tricks of the trade , trade secret ... disintegration devices . D-guns , D-bombs , D-missiles . I 'm the disintegration machine . Want a guy disintegrated , get me integrated . That 's Dengar 's motto . I want them alive . No disintegrations . As you wish . Aw , shucks . See you at the finish line , A-hole . - Where my keys ? Where my keys ? - Best bounty hunter in the league ! Better stop soft-shoeing boss . We are bounty hunters ! I got to say , Boba , this is one beauty of a ship . I 'm not crazy about the name , though . I 've made a deal that will keep the Empire out of our affairs forever . We 'd be honored if you could join us . C-can I get a little more water ? - What ? - Nothing ! I just asked for more water . Hmm ? So , how we doing ? Leia , how 's the soup ? You ever had soup this good ? Yes , on Alderaan . Hey , Princess , let it g-o-o-o-o-o-o . " Oh , help me . We 're a peaceful planet " . " You may fire when ready " . Ka-bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-om ! Big laser . Alderaan chunks everywhere . Anyone , uh ... anyone got a joke ? I 've got one . Who 's got two thumbs and betrayed his best friend ? This guy ! Uh , too soon ? Well , it 's been a time and a half . But ... lot of torturing to do . Hi . Have you or someone you know been permanently handicapped by a Jedi ? If so , call me , Bob Goldstein , at Naboo-5-SUE-JEDli . I 'll get you the money you deserve fast . I have over 10 years experience , and I 'm ready to work for you . At last we will have our revenge . You call now . I love you . I know . That I did not know . Leia and the Wookiee must never again leave this city . That was never a condition of our arrangement , nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter . I have altered the deal . Pray I don 't alter it any further . This deal 's getting worse all the time . Furthermore , I wish you to wear this dress and bonnet . This was never a condition of our arrangement . I have altered the deal . Pray I don 't alter it any further . This deal 's getting worse all the time . Here is a unicycle . You will ride it wherever you go . What ? I 'm not riding no fucking unicycle ! I have altered the deal . Pray I don 't alter it any further . This deal is getting worse all the time ! Also , you are to wear these clown shoes and refer to yourself as Mary . Oh fuck you , man ! I 'm not doing it ! I have altered the deal . Pray I don 't alter it any further . This deal ... is very fair , and I 'm happy to be a part of it . Join me , and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son . Father and son ? # Think of all the time we wasted # # So many plans we never made # Okay , don 't let go . Don 't let go , dad . Don 't ... don 't let go . I 'm doing it ! Whoo ! I 'm doing it ! I 'm doing it ! Dad ! Yeah ! # Crack , jam , take it down , slam it # # Pick it back up , but don 't forget to ram it # # I make the rounds , then I double back # # ' Cause I 'm doubling twice around # # I make the rounds , then I double back # # ' Cause I 'm doubling twice around # # I make the rounds # Father and son . What ? Oh , I said , aah , I can 't believe this apartment 's priced so low . It 's got a washer and dryer , central air . What does this do ? You know , I 'm not quite sure ... Uh . Garbage disposal ? Well , apparently it does nothing . How 's the cable in this place ? Crystal clear satellite TV . Cloud City . More like Crap City if you ask me . I 'll have the calamari . Well , I guess I 'll have the insensitive bitch , with a side of fuck you . Hello ! Meant to do it . Thank goodness . I thought I was doing this thousand years of digestion alone . How did you fall in ? What ? Fell in ? Ha ha ! Volunteered , more like it . You should 've seen it . You would 've dug it the most . I was flying around with my jet pack , just smokin ' rebels with my laser . Ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom . Han Solo was all , " hey , wait " . And I 'm like , " oh , I 've been waiting for this for a long time , Solo " . Ba-bang ! The big , bad Wookiee be growling in hell now . I even put one between Skywalker 's eyes , right between those pretty baby blues . But then Jabba the Hutt was all , " oh , no , this guy 's too badass , man " . So then 80 Jedi showed up . I took out about 67 of them , but then 20 dudes finally flanked me . And I was like , " you know what , kids ? It 's been real , daddy-o , but I 'm not giving you the pleasure " . So I jumped into the pit myself . On the way down , I was thinking , maybe I should have left ' em a party favor . Oh , I did ... a thermo detonator right up their ass . Ba-boom ! Oh , that 's awesome . At least you didn 't go out like a punk . Yeah . Oh , ' cause I looked like a badass . - Are you crying ? - No . Huh ? That 's funny . Da-da-da daaaaa-da . Da-da-da daaaaa-da . I 'm okay . Welcome , my master . The Death Star construction ... Yeah , great . Fine . Whatever . That flight was a fucking nightmare , man . My stupid tray table broke , and I ended up with a gallon of coffee in my crotch . It 's like dunking my wang in hot lava , something you have some experience with , I guess , huh ? - Right ? Ha ha ! - Yes . Is that yours ? No , for the hundredth time , that 's that same stupid black bag . Mine doesn 't have a stripe . It 's like that stripy bag is mocking me . Fuck you , stripy bag . Well , my suitcase is gone . Sacrificed to the airport gods . Now I 'm here for two fucking weeks with one fucking robe . All right , now it 's sticking to me like a wet Kleenex . Wow , for real ? Yeah , guess I 'll just be killing myself , then . Good chair , good chair . Nice lumbar support . Great view of ... utter blackness . Oh , for ... I 'm right under the air-conditioning vent . And the chair 's bolted to the floor ? Who 's the brainiac ... Hey , Crayola , help me shut this vent . Yeah , reach up there with your Staff of Ra and ... Hey , want to see me tempt fate ? Could this day get any worse ? I did it ironically , so I think I 'm safe . What are you doing ? Put me down . Convene all ships on Endor . I want the moon obliterated and the rebels wiped from the face of the galaxy . Sorry , sir . Actually , we can 't . The rebels have won . What do you mean , they won ? We have tens of thousands of ships . We ... we control countless worlds . We have millions of troops at our disposal . But they just blew up the second Death Star and killed the Emperor . - So ? - So , that means they won . How does that mean they won ? They blew up the first Death Star years ago , - and the fighting continued . - Yes , but they didn 't kill the Emperor . They had to do both . We can 't fight back ? No . Sorry . This is the end of the Empire . - Really ? - Yeah , ' fraid so . That 's it , then . What do we do now ? I guess we can go get a massage . Let 's do that .

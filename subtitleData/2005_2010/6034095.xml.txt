 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Can we get back to the Warehouse computers being breached ? Somebody is poking around in your system . I should never have told you . Warehouse 13 . I got hacked . Hey , does Artie seem a little , you know , crankier than usual ? Got to stop ... Got to stop her ! Someone 's there . I can ... What the hell was that ? Artie , what are you gonna do ? I know this place . I know this place . Yes . You 've been here before . You don 't remember it , but you will . So , this is a dream ? It 's time to get up , Artie . It 's time to go . Where am I going ? Back to the beginning . Yeah ? No more zoos , okay ? From now on , if an artifact is at a zoo , we leave it there . Monkeys spit . Artie , do you know that ? They spit and it is not worth it . Guys , guys , guys ... Tell him about the cheetahs . No , I don 't want to think about the cheetahs , all right ? I just want a bath . All right , I 'm sorry about all that . I 'm dealing with a lot here , too , okay ? Right , have you found out who 's hacking into the Warehouse ? I can 't pinpoint the origin of the breach . It 's a little frustrating . Sleep , Artie , you look terrible . Thank you very much . You still have some monkey phlegm in your hair . It 's not phlegm . Look , Artie ... Just ... Myka 's right , get some rest , bro . Okay ? Yeah . Just get back here as soon as possible . We have a lot to do , okay ? No , I can 't get up . Yes , you can . Try . I can 't ... How did you get in here ? I 'm disappointed , Artie . I figured you 'd have me totally clocked by now . Do I know you ? What 's going on ? I 'm hurt . Well , it was a while ago . I was a lot younger . So were you . Looking for this ? Dude , an alarm system ? So not groovy . Besides , this is you-and-me time right now . Yeah , it 's funny . Years ago , I swear you said you were just a simple professor . I guess you left out the off-the-grid , top-secret warehouse full of madcap . Claudia . Claudia Donovan . You 're the breach . Knock , knock . Yeah . I 'm sorry . I really don 't have time for games . These cuffs , they 're not going to stop me . I know , but check this . I super-charged the cuffs , see ? Twenty thousand volts . Designed them myself . You like ? Well done . Thank you . Now chill , I 'm not in the mood . Kid , look , that was a long , long , long time ago , that stuff . Time flies , Professor . Really does . I 'm not responsible for Joshua 's death . Claudia , look , just stop it right now before you do something you regret . I regret ? Me ? Have you got it backasswards . You 're responsible for what happened . But , hey , it 's all good . You know why ? 'Cause it 's payback time for me and for Joshua . So , let 's go , Artie . Time to make good on your promise . The door 's open . That 's not good . Artie would never leave his Farnsworth . Yeah . If there were trouble , Artie would have triggered the ... Alarm ? Someone took Artie ? Damn it , I don 't know what else to do ! The cache is wiped . There 's no tracks outside and there 's no clues in here . All right . Don 't worry , okay ? We 'll figure it out somehow . Don 't worry ? Could that be Artie ? I 'm calling for Artie . You two are decidedly not he . Mrs. Frederic , hi . Look , we got some really bad news . Look , Artie 's gone , someone took him . That doesn 't happen . Agents don 't get taken out of the Warehouse . Our security system is ... So ... I see . The person who 's breached the security , he 's taken Artie . Yeah . Any idea who this guy is ? None . So , can we put out an APB or alert the authorities ? We are the authorities . What did you learn from the durational spectrometer ? The spectro ... It shows the after images of anyone who 's been in the room in the last five hours . Are you kidding me ? Yeah , that 's like our favorite thing , with all the lights and so forth . Once you 've ID 'd them , let me know . And stay put . I don 't need three missing agents . Okay , but , Mrs. Frederic , look , if we have a lead , we could just ... Consider yourself under lockdown . I know this place . It 's a lab . It 's Joshua 's old lab . Come on , away from the door . I 'm fine right here . Think so ? Or there . There is very good , too . You 're doing this all wrong , Claudia . Brought me here in daylight . Used my car . Those are amateur moves , Claudia , and for what ? What are you going to do to me ? You 're going to kill me ? Because a long , long time ago , your brother died in an accident ? Come on . He 's not dead . Claudia ? Claudia , it was a terrible , terrible accident , but we both witnessed it and he 's gone . No , no , no , no , he 's not . He 's stuck . Listen to yourself . Look , this isn 't in my head . You 're gonna see . Be careful . Okay . Okay . Let 's ... Let 's open this baby up and see what she 's got . That 's cool . Wow . Okay . All right . That is crazy . Okay . Wow . Okay . Okay . Strange person with Artie . Who is that ? I don 't know . Who ... Who is that ? Hold on . I don 't know . Hang on . Do you have it ? Yes . Here we go . Here we go . Here we go . Okay . There we go . And ... That 's ... Okay . That 's weird . Did you see that ? Is he saying something ? What is he saying ? Do you ... Yeah . Go . Go . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Yeah . That 's a trip . It 's ... I can 't . Claudia Donovan . How did you ... My sister taught me how to read lips . Why does your sister ... The deaf find it handy . You ... Okay . Claudia Donovan , where are you now ? Mrs. Frederic said we should stay here . Really ? I didn 't hear that . Neither did I. Uh-oh . Looks like she was institutionalized . What if she 's dangerous , Pete ? So , okay . This is what ? This is poetic justice ? Bringing me back where it all started ? No , we 're here because it 's strongest here . We need that if you 're going to bring Joshua back . Back ? Nice job on these , by the way . What 's conducting the charge ? Is that lithium filaments ? Very fine craftsmanship . Dude , just shut up now . Dude , can we not ... Claudia , you 're not well . All right . Joshua 's death was ... He got the rules wrong , Claudia . Yeah . Because he got sloppy , didn 't he ? Right ? And we both know why he did that , don 't we , Artie ? Is Claudia in some kind of trouble with the Secret Service ? In the four years that Claudia lived here , did she ever give you any problems ? No . Not at all . She was very nice . Well , what can you tell us about Claudia ? I 'm not one to gossip , but you might not know she lost her parents when she was just a child , poor thing . Her brother raised her . Then a few years later , he passed , too . Can you believe it ? More bad luck than a turtle on its back . She went off to live with a foster family . Well , if you ask me , I think it all just finally hit her . And then six months ago , she checked herself into a psychiatric care clinic . You know about that ? Of course you do . You 're the government . You probably know what pills I take in the morning . Anyway , she keeps up on her rent . She checked herself out two months ago . Has she contacted you ? Well , no , I haven 't seen her . She 's got a home base somewhere . Did she ever ... Did she ever stay with friends ? I don 't think so . She kept to herself . No boyfriends , no girlfriends . I 'm very non-judgmental . Here we are . Thank you , Mrs. Richman . We 'll just take a look around . I guess I can trust the Secret Service . Oh , boy . I 'm guessing this is the brother . I don 't want to sound like a broken record , but what makes you think that Joshua is still alive ? Because dead people don 't visit , Einstein . He visits you ? Yeah . A lot lately . Your brother Joshua visits you and he tells you he 's not dead . Yes . Not appreciating the snark , by the way . Rheticus was right , you know , his theories . No . No . No , no . And Joshua was right , too . He was this close to proving it . No . No . Rheticus 's experiments were never recreated . Never . He was nuts . Joshua 's gone . You 're going to be so put down when he gets here . Yeah ? Well , you know , I 'll take my chances . God . It 's about the minerals , Professor . The minerals in the metal . That 's what should have made it all work . Sure . You know what I 'm sensing here ? That this kind of a private chat , it 's a brother-sister thing . What do you need me for ? Because I took it as far as I could and now I need you to help me bring him home . You made me a promise . Something 's wrong . That 's what I 've been saying , you fossil . God . Something 's wrong . I can 't ... I can 't ... I can 't ... I can 't ... Professor , I 'm Joshua Donovan . Joshua . Yeah , I remember this . This is when I met you . We 've met before ? Yes . No , no . You showed me your experiment . You thought I was here to give you a grant and ... That been happening a lot ? What ? You went back . No . I have the visions , too . We 're mad connected , Artie . The difference between us is I didn 't ignore them . What 's wrong ? What 's the matter with you , Claudia ? Usually happens just before . Just before what ? You 're going to want to sit down for this . He 's here . Joshua ! What is that ? What is happening ? Joshua ! Joshua ? Joshua ! Told you . What the hell was that ? I don 't understand what just happened . What 's going on ? I mean , what the hell was that ? That was Joshua . No . Yeah . You saw it , too . I 'm not crazy . Yes . Yes , I saw Joshua . How ? Because he 's not dead . Now , you know it , too . Help me bring him back . Well , I wouldn 't know where to start . Well , I 've got everything here . The Feldkirch minerals , equipment for an electric field ... Claudia , did you try to recreate Joshua 's experiment on your own ? You 're such a creaker . Yeah . Of course I did . The question is , why didn 't you ? So far , none of this stuff is telling me where Claudia might have taken Artie . Are you finding anything ? For a kid , she seems pretty focused on the 16th century . She 's definitely a thinker . Always dangerous . Rheticus . Rheti-who ? He was a mathematician and mapmaker student of Copernicus . Yes , Pete , I read books growing up . Right . Why go to the prom ? Of course you did . Yeah . Three times in one night . It 's a long story . I bet it is . I bet it is . Well , it looks like our girl genius took something with her . Just , you know ... Just to clarify , you decided to recreate a clearly dangerous , potentially deadly experiment ? Sure , it sounds bad when you say it like that . Claudia , these are very real forces that you 're playing with here . And if you stop to think ... Chill out , Obi-Wan , okay ? I 'm trying to save my brother 's life here . I really hope that we are trying to save it together . I 've spent the last two years of my life trying to figure out what happened to Joshua . And when I reached the end of what I could do , I just kind of , sort of took a peek at your research . You what ? You took a peek ? You hacked into highly classified government files . Oh , I 'm all puckered . You know , imagine my surprise when I discovered that you had done nothing to help him . In 12 years , naught . I thought he was dead . Oops ! Wrong . Now you can help . Don 't tell me you don 't want to . I know you have guilt . Hey ! Hey , look at me . I don 't . Whatever helps you sleep at night , Professor . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Lay off . Yeah . You 're fine . Yeah , sure . The nosebleed is what , just for fun ? Damn it . I 've been jamming for answers . I 'm just a little burned out . Yeah . And then I 'm just gonna guess that it 's getting a little worse . Okay . It 's like three to four times a week , now . But it 's just stress . I mean , you get stressed , you get the flu . Everybody knows that . It 's not the flu , dummy . You 're so close to this , you can 't see that it is your connection to the experiment that 's making you sick . No , please , it 's just ... It 's just ... Yeah . Rheticus was attempting human teleportation . So was Joshua . It 's beyond dangerous . Look , it 'll be a little easier for me to see what you 've got if you take off the cuffs . " When love is lost and loss o 'ertakes me " The rules of love then are hidden " And chaos rules and order lost " And hidden then my heart from love " Hey . What is that ? Nothing . Nothing . It 's not important . Hey . A compass . Rheticus claimed he owned it , only no one ever saw it . It says here it probably never existed . It 's just folklore . Okay , now , is it just me , or does that sound all artifact-y ? Well , you 've got the Feldkirch minerals and you 're using an electrical field . But what about the rest ? The compass disappeared with Joshua . My question is , what are you using instead of the compass ? Aren 't the minerals enough ? Uh-uh . It 's the same as the metal in the compass . It 's the same thing . No , no , no , no . You can 't just replace an artifact with , you know , something else . There 's always an X factor . Okay . Which is maybe why I need your help . Which is why you shouldn 't have done this at all . I 'm shutting you down . No . Hey ! Hey ! You said you were gonna help me . What I said was , I would look . Which I now have , and believe me , shutting you down , that is helping you . Okay , fine . You know what ? Fine . Just do it . Just shut me down . You abandoned him once , why shouldn 't you do it again ? It isn 't like that . No , it 's exactly like that . Joshua and me , on our own , again . It 's a good thing I 'm used to it . I know that it hasn 't been easy . No . No , it hasn 't been easy . He was all I had after our parents died . And then he was gone , too . He spent his fun years sewing Girl Scout patches and teaching me how to fold an omelet . And then , reading Maria Looney on the Red Planet to me every night . He was a genius who put his life on hold for me . None of that 's your fault . I opened a door to wherever he is and now he 's in pain . You saw his face . That is my fault . Me ! I 'm the epic fail . Claudia , it is making you sick . I owe him , and so do you , and we 're running out of time . Damn it , Artie ! Help me save Joshua . It 's a pay phone . What ? Lattimer . Pete , how are you ? How are you doing ? Artie ! Artie , hey , man , are you all right ? Ask him where he is . Oh , yeah . No . I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I 'm just here with an old friend , that 's all . Claudia Donovan . Very good . You read my lips using the durational spectrometer , didn 't you ? Where is he ? Where ... Wait , he probably doesn 't know . Right . Right . Artie , do you hear anything ? A freeway , machinery ... Train whistles . Ask him if he hears any train whistles . Guys . Hey ! Hey ! Look , the truth is that I 'm helping her . All right ? You 're helping her ? He 's helping her ? You 're helping her , Artie ? I figured that you 'd be halfway towards finding us , but you can stop now . Did you hear me ? You can stop . No , Artie , she 's been under observation at a psychiatric facility , all right ? Oh , I had no ... Poor kid , I didn 't know . No . No . Not poor kid . Poor Artie . She 's obsessed with you . She 's obsessed with the Warehouse , and I 'm not letting you stay with her . You 're what ? You 're not letting me ? That 's really cute , Myka . Cute . Cute . She 's cute ? Does she have a gun on you ? Okay , look . These kids lives were messed up by ... They 're in trouble , I can help , that 's all you need to know . Well , let us come and help you . No , no ! No ! No ! We have everything we need to make this work . And I 'm telling you , I 'm fine . But , Artie , wait , wait ! Artie , Artie ! He hung up . Now let 's just get back before Frederic finds out we 're gone . Seriously , you know , if Mrs. Frederic can call us , we should be able to call her . Is there a star 69 on this thing ? Star 69 wasn 't invented when that was made . No . This wasn 't invented when this was made . Why doesn 't Artie want us to help him , Pete ? What 's going on ? Yes . What 's going on indeed ? Man , I really hate that . I believe I told you to stay put . No , I know . It 's just that we were going to ... We had to ... You know , it would be nice if we could contact you . We had a lead . We decided to follow it . Okay , don 't make her angry . What kind of lead ? Well , Artie is with Claudia Donovan . Voluntarily . Do you know where they are ? It 's possible . But we 've got bigger fish . You need to get down to the Warehouse floor . Find the San Anselmo grid . On the Locksberg shelf number 1021 . Section 405-949-04 . Wait . We have a right to know where Artie ... Miss Bering . Your right extends exactly as far as I say it does . If Artie is working with Claudia , he may be trying to recreate her brother 's experiment . And that 's bad ? Where do you work ? Right . The Rheticus compass . Yes . His experiments were successful . That 's why he didn 't disappear into thin air . And Joshua did . Yes , something went awry . You have to glean how Joshua went wrong 12 years ago . I still don 't understand why you don 't tell us ... What Tell you where he is ? If you run after Artie , governed solely by your affection for him , you won 't be helping him . I don 't think it 's a bad thing to care about Artie . He needs information , not emotion . You go empty-handed , the experiment ends up just as it did before . You 're merely two more lost bodies . Thank you . So , what are we looking for on the San Anselmo grid ? I 'm not certain . But every artifact in this Warehouse is an extension of a person . Understand Rheticus , understand the compass . And for the record , I care a great deal what happens to Artie . Gleaned . Miss Fancy . You 're lucky that I have an emergency travel kit in the trunk of my car . Well , " Serendipity " is my stripper name . Okay , so , without the compass , what I 'm hoping is that some of these will be able to help us get a much , much stronger electrical charge than what you were able to get using conventional means . Now , to electrify the Feldkirch minerals to a higher frequency . Ben Franklin 's lightning rod . I thought his thing was a key . No , no , no , no , everybody fixates on the key . No , no . Please . This is much , much better . Trust me . Well , what about ... That 's terrifying . Listen . Heard about the psych ward . I had no idea . I 'm sorry . Yeah . Well ... Hey . It 's his journal . Take a look . Joshua 's ? Mmm-hmm . See this ? That 's a rubbing of the edge ... Useless . Useless . Useless . Useless . I 'm guessing Artie thought these things were useless . I mean , they 're all Rheticus gadgets , but none of them tripped Artie 's trigger . Okay , so , Joshua had to follow all these rules to try and make the compass work . Right ? The kid even figured out this complicated differential equation . He was a genius . Yeah , and the compass still didn 't work . Well , it half worked . Ooh ! What is that ? It 's engraved with the letter T. T ? Why not an R ? Why T ? I don 't know what it means . Okay ? Look , Artie 's notes said that Rheticus 's work often expressed a need for order . So , what did Joshua miss ? I mean ... Maybe he translated something wrong or ... I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know . Maybe . What are you doing ? Rules and order , right ? Right . Okay , well , after spending the last couple of months with someone who also likes those things , you know , crosswords , puzzles ... I like puzzles . So ? So ... So did Rheticus . A secret panel . I 'm increasing the power of the electrical field here by about 17 times where you had it . So ... You may want to stand back . Yeah . Standing isn 't really an option right now . You all right ? What ? Oh , super . Artie , he 's almost here . I know . I feel ... I feel ... Feels like something familiar . Listen , I know , I know , I know . It 's all folklore . I know this place . I know this place . Professor , I have found all of the instructions that I need . I have the equation for the electrical field . I have all of these things . Nobody believes that Rheticus succeeded . I mean , it 's probably just a bedtime story , Joshua . That 's what you think . Joshua doesn 't get the concept of being nice to the money guy . Do you want the professor to recommend you for the grant or not ? See , Claudia here doesn 't get the concept of being ten . Joshua , please don 't do this . It 's okay , Professor . He may be antisocial , but he 's very smart . Knows what he 's doing . Does he ? See this ? This is his compass . I know I can recreate what Rheticus did . It 's teleportation , Professor . Please , don 't . Hey , trust me . I started having the dreams two years ago . It 's what got me started on all this , because we were both here . Hang in there , kid . This should be a good first run . We 'll be able to slow him down with this one . Yeah . I got it . Hold on . Claudia . Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia . Claudia ? Man , this guy was nuts for secret panels . Yeah . And they weren 't mentioned in any of Claudia 's books . Yeah , and if she didn 't know , it 's a safe bet that Artie and Joshua didn 't know . You see the writing around these edges ? Yeah , it 's Latin . Oh , let me guess . You speak Latin , too . Okay . Make one more nerd joke , and I 'm going to point out how you 're losing your hair . Okay ? Okay , so , the rules , right ? The rules are in Latin , and rules teach us how to use the objects . So , Joshua took them off the compass himself . Yeah , but he was missing something . Rheticus hid some rules . And Joshua never saw them . Nice . And I 'm not losing my hair . You don 't have it high enough yet , Artie , I 'm stuck . No , Joshua ! I can help you . No . Claudia 's tied to this now . It 's killing her . And you . You 're tied to this now , too . She 's the one I 'm worried about . Joshua ! Just come back twice more . I can hold you here . I can save you both . No . No . Will you look at her ? This place is growing increasingly unstable . It 's getting worse . Next time I show up here , it will kill her . Okay , here 's ... You have to cut the tether . All right ? Overload the electrical field . The conductor you 're using ? The lightning rod . Yeah . Blow it up . Just use that . No , that 'll destroy the whole ... It 'll kill you , Joshua . I know . You can 't save us both . To save her you have to kill me . Do it before I 'm pulled back here again . So , there 's something hidden on the compass . And we think it 's the rule that Joshua missed . Nicely done . Now , check this out . In Artie 's notes it said that Joshua had everything that he needed for his experiment in his lab . Where it was locked up for 12 years . But before Artie hung up , he said that he had everything that he needed . Bing bang boom . Claudia took Artie to the lab . You took the initiative , and you recognized what needed to be done , all in Artie 's absence . I 'm pleased . I know , right ? Score ! Why the test ? Is Artie going somewhere ? Let 's hope not . The directions are in the file . You should get to that lab , and quickly . We don 't know how much time we 've got left . Do you think she 's weird ? I think she 's weird . She always acts weird . Joshua come and gone already ? Yeah . Craptastic . At least we 're closer to bringing him back . Okay . You all right ? Yeah . No . I 'm fine . Listen . Yeah ? Thank you . Teleportation is such a powerful weapon , and people want it , Joshua . They 're gonna come get it . But I think I finally solved the equation . Listen to me . I could just lay low . It 's ... Listen to me . Look , the people that ... The people that want it , want it now , they 're coming after you right now . There 's no time left , Joshua . What you have to do is , you have to protect yourself . You have to protect your family . Just give me the compass temporarily . I know exactly where to put it , where it 'll be safe . It 's ... It 's in my professor 's office . Good . Stay with Claudia until I get back . I 'll just be a minute . Thank you , Professor . Sure . Hey , what 're you doing ? I made a promise to your brother that I 'm not going to let anything happen to you . What ? We 're blowing this up . But that 'll kill Joshua . Artie , you have to put that back . You have to have the field ready to catch him . No , no , no , no , no . That will kill you , and I don 't care if you hate me . I 'm not going to let you die , too . I do hate you . I 'm never going to forgive you . He 's on his way . Good . That 's good . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Yes , something . What ? It 's just your brother . He should be back by now . That 's all . You know what ? Why don 't we go check on him ? Okay ? Don 't worry . I won 't let anything happen to Joshua . I promise . Claudia , I don 't have much time before it starts again . I 'm sorry . For everything . But I 've got to save one of you . Showtime . Showtime . Artie ! Joshua ! I told you not to do this ! I told you not to follow me . Dock our pay . We came here to save you . Is that Claudia Donovan ? Yes . Yes . She 's just unconscious . What ? What ? Joshua didn 't have all the rules , Artie . Rheticus loved puzzles . And his designs had secret panels . It 's inside ? It 's inside the compass ? Yes , in Latin . Where is it , Artie ? Where is the compass , Artie ? You just have to pop open the panel and find out which rule it is . So , where is it ? I don 't ... I don 't ... I don 't have it . I had to try , Artie . I couldn 't give up without trying . Once you said that there was no more time left , I had to prove that I could teleport . No . No . No . No . No . No . No ... Artie , what are you doing ? I 'm doing what Joshua did . No ! No ! That 's how he died . He 's not dead . Claudia , I think I can save him . But what I have to do ... Don 't do this . Artie ! Artie , make him stop ! You promised ! Claudia , it 's okay . Remember , I will always , always ... Artie , what 's happening ? It 's not over . Joshua ! Touch my hand . Joshua ! Artie , no ! Okay , where the hell are we ? Claudia , Artie , you 're here . Joshua . Look at you . You ... I can 't believe you 're here . Yeah , I 'm here . I 'm here . Wait , I 'm here ? You took me to the inter-dimensional space ? You were supposed to get him out , D-bag . No , he was supposed to destroy it . Clearly he 's insane . Children , don 't fight . Please , I can be both a D-bag and insane . Just where 's the compass ? It 's right there . Okay . Rheticus put rules written on objects , sometimes inside objects . A hidden panel , yeah . Yes , yes , yes . In this case , it requires a combination , but they didn 't mention a combination . Wait . Letters or numbers ? Letters . But there 's 20-something letters . How many ? Artie ? Try T-H-O-M-A-S . Why ? Thomas . Rheticus wrote a poem The Loss of Reason about his lost love , somebody named Thomas . Thomas . Yeah , okay . How did I miss that ? Latin . Oh , crap ! No , no , no , no . It 's fine . I can read it . It 's just directions . Move the dial 90 degrees towards axis . What ? I 'm no expert , but maybe hang on . Can we touch the ... Artie ? Are you okay ? All right . So ... I thought we lost you , buddy . Oh , thanks . Thanks for not giving up . Shut up . So , the secret panel thing . I got to say , very nice work . Well , we were motivated , you know . Maybe you should ditch us more often . I 'm really sorry about that . If you ever do that again , I 'm not finding you , and I quit . Yeah . Just out of curiosity , by the way , how exactly did you figure out the secret panel thing ? Well , each artifact is an extension of a person , Artie . We gleaned what we needed from the person . Mmm-hmm . Mrs. Frederic . I thought so . Hey , hey , you know , she 's pretty scary , man . If we hadn 't found something , she probably would have glared us to death . Yeah . You have no idea . What ? It 's just ... It couldn 't have been easy losing someone on the job like that . It wasn 't . Well , you know , if you ever want to talk about it ... I don 't want to talk about it . Okay . Oh . Oh , uh ... You know , unless you want to talk about it . I mean ... Unless you want ... Anytime you want to talk about it is fine , okay ? Okay . Okay , bye . Bye . Bye . Hello , Mrs. Frederic . Arthur . An in-person visit . Must have done something right , or wrong . It 's a little of both . I had to go back . I know . I was responsible back then . You wanted him to teleport ? I thought he could do it . No , I knew . So I pushed him . And he was lost for 12 years . And you might have prevented it all . And I might have saved Gus , but I didn 't . We make mistakes . Some people are lost . We can 't save everyone . Something to keep in mind regarding Mr. Lattimer and Miss Bering . That 's not why I 'm here . Then why ? The girl , Claudia . We didn 't do a very good job of protecting her , did we ? She was determined to find her brother . And in the process , she learned a great deal about the Warehouse , which could become problematic . She wouldn 't hurt us . But others might . And ... You know what the options are . Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Years ago , I swear you said you were just a simple professor . You left out the top-secret warehouse full of madcap . Claudia . You 're the breach . Knock , knock . Your brother Joshua visits you and tells you he 's not dead . He 's stuck . Help me bring him back . Oh , thanks . Thanks for not giving up . Claudia learned a great deal about the Warehouse , which could become problematic . You know what the options are . And this . And this . What artifact did that ? Or is that the artifact ? It was created by late , little-known sculptor Walter Burleigh . And it was stolen late last night from a high-end auction house in New York . But that 's not the issue . The issue is how this thing was stolen , because why , after I just got back into this world , you 're in such a rush to shove me out the door ? Because I didn 't spend half my life trying to save your life so you could surf the net and watch YouTube . Well , excuse me for trying to catch up on current events and the state of the world for the last 12 years . Hey , we 're working . We 're working right here . Artie , I 'm sorry . But apparently , I have to find a job . Don 't know exactly what I 'm going to put in that little gap in my resume . Well , hey , what about what got you there in the first place ? You ! What ? Don 't you have something to do ? Like stay out of federal prison ? And aren 't you supposed to be writing me a full technical schematic on how you cracked my Warehouse ? Yeah , buddy , it 's upstairs . It 's almost finished . Well , then , I want you to finish it . And I want every redirect and every backslash . Go , now . And then , after that , you 're going into the Warehouse and you 're going to rewire what you unwired when you broke in . I 'd like to unwire you . Ah ! The patter of little feet . All right , so , Artie , somebody boosts an ugly sculpture . Why does that involve us ? Okay , what is significant here is how this thing was stolen . I mean , this theft was impossible . It was a high-end alarm system and 8-inch-thick walls , sealed vault . So , one second that sculpture was there , next second gone . But it 's still just a well-executed art theft . I mean , it doesn 't automatically shout " Warehouse , " does it ? Things rarely shout " Warehouse . " They usually whisper . Hey , isn 't this a little odd ? That 's what they do . Yeah . Well , I could be wrong . I mean , it could be nothing . But I 'm probably not wrong . Last time I was wrong was 1987 , June . Stop right there . That . I want to hear more about that . Not a chance . Go . Okay . Here we go . Going . Go , go , go , go , go . Hey , Artie . Yeah ? Hey , you know I love New York . A great town . Yeah . It is . So , I was just thinking maybe you guys could kick down some tickets to a show or ... Well , it depends on the show . Really ? No . Get out of here . Show . Think you 're gonna have time for a stupid musical . Or that I 'd even pay for it . Off Broadway 's not that expensive . Carruther 's Auction House prides itself on security . This theft has us stumped . Video surveillance shows nothing . I 'm assuming you use an electronic lock that records all activity . And it says the door never opened . Who 's selling the piece ? Private estate . He decided to auction after he was approached by two interested parties , both with deep pockets . When is this auction scheduled ? It was for today . I hate to ask , but would you mind ? Oh ... You know , maybe one of these interested parties hates competition . Which would mean that said party has an artifact that lets them pull off an impossible heist . Or the simple answer , an inside job . She does bear scrutiny . Follow me . Yes , ma 'am . She 's out of your league . How do you know what my league is ? Not that I asked for them , but I 've got season tickets . That 's good . I like that . So , the thief takes one piece . Was it the most valuable one in here ? No . Far from it . But there 's no accounting for taste . I don 't know . Some things are just classic . Pete . Yeah . Can you come here for a second ? Excuse me . Hmm ? Why don 't I stay here in the vault , look for anything , you know , Warehouse-y and you go check out those two interested parties ? Well , wouldn 't things go quicker if we just work together ? Well , not if you 're on a date . Look , this way we can cover twice as much ground and maybe you 'll even get done in time to take skirt-girl to a show . Two interested parties , huh ? I 'll get their info . Great . I 'll go with . Batter up . Agent Lattimer ? Hey . Gilbert Radburn . Yeah , I 've seen your name on a few buildings . Good . That 's why I put it up there . What can I do for you ? You were interested in the sculpture that was stolen last night , the Burleigh ? I was . And as you might guess , I 'm not fond of losing . What 's the Secret Service 's interest ? How it was stolen . Which was ? You mind telling me where you were last night ? Ha ! I have no need to steal . Well , sometimes it 's not about stealing . You know , it 's about conquering . Like putting your name on a building . I was with friends . All night ? This is the city that never sleeps . Do you want names ? Yes , please . That would be swell . Also , why the Burleigh ? What 's so special about it ? Eye of the beholder , Agent Lattimer . Eye of the beholder . Yeah . I 'll get you those names . Thank you , sir . What 's up ? You should get back here . You got something ? I found something behind one of the crates , but it 's easier to show and tell . What is it ? You 're not going to believe this , but I smell fudge . I 'll be right there . What are we talking about here ? Well , it 's right here . You can see it . Right . What the hell ? Okay . Easy . Whoa ! Oh . Pete , no . No . Artifact behavior usually requires a human element , right ? Yeah . Just be careful . Okay . Okay ? Okay . Wow . Oh , my ... Check it out . It 's crazy . Okay , you see , this is one of those artifacts that I 'd really like to keep . Pete , put it in . " Hey , Rocky , watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat . " Now that 's cool . Ouch ! That 's what I thought . What ? That pinching causes pain ? No . No . I know that . But the feather , it only works up to your elbow . So , not enough to get in and out with the sculpture . Exactly . Which means that this is only part of the artifact . It 's not the whole thing . Well , at least that narrows it down . We 're looking for an art-stealing bird that walks through walls . Like Artie always says , " Never rule anything out . " " Never rule anything out . " Show me . Okay . Looks Native American . Yeah , we think it fell off something larger , a ceremonial object , a walking stick , a peace pipe maybe . Or a bird . Yeah . Any guesses who this thing belonged to ? Well , maybe one of the two guys who wanted to buy the sculpture , but we haven 't interviewed one of them yet . Radburn 's too rich to risk it . He could outbid Donald Trump . I think we can rule him out . Never rule anything out . Okay . Well , the second guy 's a rich dude . His name is Jeffrey Weaver . Jeffrey Weaver ? Is that the son of Alexander Weaver ? Artie , who is Alexander Weaver ? Yeah . Was . He was an extortionist , real estate swindler . And a ravager of cultures . Not a nice man . Now deceased . And , yes , his son , Jeffrey , lives in New York , so ... Look , unless the acorn fell very far from the tree , watch your backs . Hmm . Which one are you Let 's see . Is it that one ? Whoa ! Jeez ! Hey ! Chill , sparky . How 's it going ? You mean , are you scared I 'm gonna burn the house down ? Emergency exits are clearly marked . You think my concern for you is insincere ? I think you should pass me the cable shears . Those . So , anxious to get on with your life ? Such shocking insight . Did my aura tell you that ? You 're certainly pushing Joshua . Only ' cause he needs it . You do have a thing for him . You 're changing the subject . You brought him up . Now that you 've saved him , your life 's work is complete . And that scares you . So , you 're forcing your own need for a purpose onto him . Genius . And all done without a couch . How much do I owe you , Dr. Freud ? If Joshua accomplishes great things , then your sacrifice is justified . But you 're also afraid of being alone . Truly alone . It 's okay if I don 't like you , right ? Of course . But you do . Mr. Weaver will be right with you . Thank you . Wow ! Call the cops . Crime solved . It 's not what it looks like . No ? Because what it looks like is that you 're in possession of stolen goods . Take a closer look . That 's not the one that was stolen . There are four in the series , each named for one of the four elements . This one is fire , the stolen one is wind . Check with the auction house . How can you tell them apart ? You 're a trained expert with a scrupulous eye for detail . Or you read the brass plaque on the base . Jeff Weaver . Myka Bering , pleasure . Right . You mind telling us where you were last night ? Hosting a charity event for the Children 's Hospital in New Orleans . Rich , good-Iooking , likes kids . Who 's on a date now ? Okay , you said that there were four sculptures , earth , wind and fire ? Love those guys . Rock , wind and fire , actually . And water . Right . It 's the artist 's tribute to Native American creation myth . Native Americans ? You into that stuff ? It 's an interest . You wouldn 't happen to be missing a feather , would you ? Maybe off something that lets you walk through walls ? What 'd you just say ? You 've got a lousy poker face there , Jeffy . New Orleans is , what , a three-hour flight away ? You 're still on our suspect list . Lacell , get in here ! Whoa ! Hey , hold it right there ! Don 't move , let me see your hands . What is it ? This dude was at Radburn 's construction site . Yeah . He was giving me the stink eye . It 's all right . His name is Lacell . He works for me . We 'll decide when it 's all right , okay ? He also works for Radburn . It 's ... It 's complicated . Hey , wait . You work for Weaver and Radburn ? Look , Lacell 's not the problem . If what you said about someone walking through walls is true , this sculpture isn 't safe . You think they 're coming after this one next , don 't you ? We 're standing right here . I think we 've got it covered . Thank you , but I can provide my own protection . That 's not an offer , okay ? If somebody 's walking through walls , the United States government needs to know who and how . All I can tell you is this sculpture is the next target . So , please , let me move it to a secure location . All right , well , hold on . What 's that , Badgey ? Hmm ? Okay . Sorry , Badgey says we stay with the sculpture . So , wherever it goes , we go . No , no , no , no , no , don 't touch that . I 'm in the middle of a game . With whom ? Myself . White 's been backed into a corner by black . I 'm waiting for a eureka moment to save white 's butt . Been waiting a while ? Three months . Why ? Claudia was looking it over . Noticed you were in a bit of a pickle . She noticed I was in a pickle . Where is the little demon ? She 's in there . She 's got work to do . Artie , Artie , Artie , she 's taking a break . She 's been working very hard . I hate that look . Here it comes . Claudia needs a home . This is not the humane society . She is not a stray cat . She 's not staying here . Mrs. Frederic 's getting antsy as it is . I 'm not suggesting she stay here . Artie , you can pull strings . MIT , Caltech . Please . She needs a challenge . Artie , she needs people . She 's got Joshua . And Joshua 's on his own path . Yes , they 're both brilliant , but he 's a researcher , and she 's a doer . She needs people like her . Brash , rude , anti-social , impulsive ? We 're discussing Claudia , not you . See , that 's kind of a low-blow . If you weren 't so brash , rude ... What are you doing ? No , no , no , no , no , no ! Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! Check . I 'll be damned . Maybe , but I 'm not one to judge . White beats black in nine moves . Whoa ! Is the sculpture okay back there ? Yes , it 's fine . I 'm fine , too , by the way . Thank you for asking . Hey , would you tell Chief Lead Foot to take it easy ? And how much longer until we reach the airport , anyway ? Pete , is everything okay ? Stop the truck ! Stop the truck ! Pete , are you okay ? Pete , look at me . Hey , stop ! Pete ? I need an ambulance right away . Pete ! Hey , partner . How are you feeling ? Sore . Everywhere . Any cookies ? You 've been out for a while . Remember anything ? I had my molecules rearranged , and I got shoved out the side of a moving truck . That about sums it up . Not surprisingly , it gives you quite a headache . You know , I told Artie what you said about the buckskin coat before you passed out , and the creation myth . He 's doing his thing . Yeah , I don 't get it . I mean , this guy could be robbing Fort Knox . Why the sculptures ? I guess that 's our little puzzle , isn 't it ? Mmm . The pretty boy . What is he doing here ? Jeff got you a free multi-point inspection , made sure all your parts are where they belong . Jeff did ? Yes , Jeff did . He owns the hospital , or built it , or something . Well , that 's handy . He asked me to dinner . It 's 3 : 00 a.m. Well , in the cafeteria . Big spender . But I said no . You should go . No . I should stay here with you . Nah . Nah . I mean , Pete ... Pete . No . Myka . This guy knows what 's going on . Now , go for it . You know , use your feminine wiles . Smile . You 're pretty when you smile . I am ? Yeah . So , what does that mean when I 'm not smiling ? You 're kind of frightening . Head injury . Nurse . Something I said ? I was just going to come tell you . Here I am . Yeah , you were right . I have to go . Wow ! Zero to 120 . I didn 't mean today . I was just looking for some forward momentum . Yeah , well , Artie made a few calls . And there 's a position at CERN . I should take it . It 's a once in a lifetime . You 're going to Switzerland ? Yeah . Smashing atoms ? Like you said , I can 't spend the rest of my life listening to Springsteen and surfing the web . Hey , if an inter-dimensional rift can 't keep me from being in touch with you , you think a few thousand miles will ? Well , you better . As I think I 've demonstrated , I will hunt you down . Yeah . Come here . Come on . Pete 's fine , but somebody else could get hurt . I mean , where does that buckskin coat come from ? Is it connected to the sculpture somehow ? There are hundreds of these Native American creation myths . I know . I know . I still think that the feather , however , gives us our best clue . Anyway , the feather was predominantly used by the Delaware Nations and also by the ... Aha ! By the Lenape tribe . They 're the ones who sold Manhattan to the Dutch for 24 bucks worth of arts and crafts . That 's not a great deal . You had to be there . And according to Lenape legend , the world was created through the spirits of four elements . Four . Fire which gave us our soul , wind , our breath , water , death ... This is fascinating . And rock , which gave the ... Leena . Rock gave the world solidity . So , someone has a buckskin coat that manipulates solidity . Manipulates solidity . I think that this whole thing could be a pattern . Because if there are artifacts that control the other elements , and somebody were to acquire those artifacts , that somebody would have immense power over ... The world . At the risk of sounding dramatic . That 's never stopped you before . That 's true . Mama ? Pete , what took you so long ? Listen , Jeffrey Weaver , I think that that guy needs a second look . Yeah . Myka 's taking a look at him now over dry turkey , mushy vegetables and tapioca pudding . Okay , you 're still in the hospital ? I got pushed out of the side of a steel truck . I 'm recuperating . Yeah , well , recuperate later . Because while Myka 's keeping Weaver busy , I 'm gonna need you to toss his apartment . Why steal his stuff from himself ? Is Weaver our guy ? Well , tell me what you find out and I will let you know . It 's very romantic . I had Verna turn up the steam tables . It 's all about atmosphere . Well , you sure know how to wow a girl . It 's my best move . So , what made you join the Secret Service ? Well , it was either that or prison . I 'm kidding . What about you ? I mean , what is it you do exactly ? Accrue interest . Re-invest . Try and do something good with it . That 's a nice life . Yeah , well , it depends on how you got it . Your father . My father , yeah . And you don 't want to follow in his footsteps , is that it ? I want to erase his footsteps . What ? What ? I 'm just trying to decide if I 'm sitting here with a good guy or a bad guy . You know who was in business with Radburn years ago ? The other guy who wanted the sculpture ? That 's right . Jeffrey Weaver 's father . Both those guys tried to push really hard at that time to sell them all four of his sculptures . Yeah , what do they do ? I don 't know . I guess , you know , something happens when you put all four sculptures together . My best guess . Something ... Bad . Bad , bad . You find anything at Weaver 's yet ? No . I don 't know . This place is clean . If he 's the guy with the coat , he probably ... Come on . What ? It 's probably nothing . I 'll call you back . No , no , no , wait , wait . What ... You 've got to be kidding me . What a hack . Bingo-mania . So , what are you really after in all of this ? And don 't tell me , " The government needs to know . " I 'm here for the coat . And , yeah , the government actually does want it . There are certain things that just shouldn 't be out in the world . True . But you . You 're only interested in the sculptures . Why ? They 're not that valuable . You know , I think things that were created together belong together . Whoever 's doing this , and I haven 't ruled you out yet , is also collecting them . What happens when the four sculptures are together ? Seriously , Jeff , you should tell me before somebody ... Just give me a second . Pete ? Is everything okay up there ? Yeah . I 'm at Weaver 's . What ? What are you ... The guy 's got a secret room that 's a shrine to Burleigh . He must have bought up everything the guy ever touched . Whatever 's going on , your boyfriend 's neck deep in it . I 'll wrap this up then . So , we should probably head upstairs , huh ? You know , I 'd really rather go back to your place . It 's funny . I usually like it when a beautiful woman says that . That is funny . That is funny because I never like it when my date lies to me . You know , I don 't ... Burleigh was married to a Lenape woman . The sculptures are some kind of a key to a sacred underground cave . To a sacred what ? A cave . It says that it contains four offerings to the spirits of creation . Somehow , he hid the directions to the cave in the sculptures . So , those four sculptures , they 're a map ? If you put the four sculptures together , maybe they tell you where this cave is . Yeah , but how , Artie ? I mean , we 're missing something . Mr. Radburn , we found this man trying to break in . It 's Lacell , right ? What do you do for me , Mr. Lacell ? Geological surveys , sir . That 's right . You see what 's underground , don 't you ? And yet , here you are , lurking very high above ground . Find anything interesting ? No , sir . You 're not a very good liar , Mr. Lacell . And you work for Mr. Weaver . Don 't waste your breath with denials . Was he wearing it ? Yes , sir . Let me have it . Tell me about this . It 's nothing . My father gave it to me . Don 't you mean your uncle ? As I said before , deception is not your strong suit . Walter Burleigh was your uncle , wasn 't he ? Why do you think that I hired you ? I had hoped you would lead me to the place . Your uncle hid clues to the sacred cave in his art . What 's this ? " Water , rock , wind . " Well , that 's helpful . Now I know how to arrange the sculptures . Wait for me outside . But what then ? How does it work ? How will they lead me to the place where the objects are hidden ? I don 't know . Give that back . You have what you want . Do you want to leave here alive , Lacell ? Well , is there more ? " The truth is in the dawn . " What does it mean ? I don 't know . The truth is in the dawn . What does it mean ? I don 't know ! I don 't know ! I suppose you didn 't know . The truth is in the dawn . The truth is in the dawn . Look , I ... I don 't know what that means , but it 's written all over Burleigh 's notes . What 's written ? Dawn . This ... I mean , I don 't know . Creation maybe ? Tony Orlando and ... Creation . Or destruction . Yeah . Look , Artie , how much of this stuff do we really believe ? Enough that if he 's looking for this cave , it 's better that we find it first . I would agree with that . Your partner 's already got me covered . " Lucy , you 've got some ' splainin ' to do . " So , where 's the coat ? Gilbert Radburn beat me to it , same way he 's been trying to find the cave . What cave ? Underground , sacred . Check it out . We have to stop him . Like you said , there are some things that should not be out in the world . Yeah , well , what about that big guy that works for the two of you ? Lacell is Lenape . He wants to save the cave , too . He 's been my eyes at Radburn 's digs . He hasn 't checked in , either . I think something 's happened . Okay , so , we have to find this cave before Radburn does . Well , if he 's got all four sculptures , he could be there now . We 've got all of Burleigh 's notes right here . No . That hasn 't helped me solve it yet . True , Mr. Weaver , but you 're not me . And right now , we need to find the location of that cave before Radburn does . The truth is in the dawn . Well , of course . It 's a map . Thank you . So , Burleigh stopped taking notes when he got close to finding the cave . Yeah . It 's like he realized the stories were true and stopped writing anything down . Well , you know , I think it may be enough because I found all these old maps ... Knock , knock . ... and I ... I wish you wouldn 't do that . God . Not funny . Hang on ... I just came by to grab my tools and then I 'm hitting the proverbial road . I 'm thinking Vegas . Not ... " Really ? Vegas , Claudia ? " Remember , always hit on 16 , never on 17 . " There 's got to be a Lenape settlement here somewhere , and it 's got to be somewhere safe . Yeah , and they 'd look for a place with special properties . It 's gotta be somewhere safe . So , no , this is not ... What ? What ? Hey , hey , you 'II ... Dude , have you considered matching these against magnetic ley lines ? No , you don 't ... One runs right along the east edge of the island . Right there . This is the ... So ... An underground cave in Manhattan , huh ? You know , if no one 's run into it ... In all these years , then we can eliminate everywhere where they 've dug for major utility junctions and subways . Subways . This looks right . Indeed , it does . Guys , I think I 've got it . I 've got it . It is Lower East Side , Corlears Hook . That is just south of the Williamsburg Bridge . And it 's right near the water and it 's gotta be away from the subway lines . And Claudia pointed out that ... Uh ... Radburn 's building there . He 's been digging everywhere that Burleigh focused using new construction to cover his hunt . Then he 's close to finding it . Okay , Artie , we 're heading out . Yeah , okay . Feel free to hurry . Yeah . All right , I need to get right here , right next to this cave . How long will that take ? We can blow it in five minutes . I need the contents of the cave to be intact . Nothing can be disturbed . Contents ? Well , if it 's a surgical blow , I say we blast right here , next to it , and go sideways the last couple of feet by jackhammering . You just get me next to that cave . I 'll take care of everything else . Let 's go . Fire in the hole ! Your site 's just 18 inches the other side of that wall . Let me get a couple guys with jackhammers . No one comes near here . You understand ? It 's true . It 's all true . The water of eternal life . " You shall have the power of nature herself . " Hey ! Hey , hey , hey ! Gilbert Radburn , where is he ? Down at the blast site , but I 'm getting out of here . Let 's go . " He shall have the strength of 100 men . " And he shall harness the strength of the Earth . " You kind of got your hands full , don 't you ? Don 't , Gil ! You don 't know what you 're dealing with . You 're too late , Jeff . This is what I was meant to do . Nut bag . The nuttiest . Okay , Radburn , drop the arrow . Put it back , Gil . It 's not for us ! Not for you , Jeff . You 're weak . So was your father . Listen to me , you don 't know what you 're doing . The fourth element completes the transformation . Then nothing can stop me . How fitting that this place should be your tomb . No , no , no , it 's not meant for you . They 're meant for the man who 's strong enough to use them . Knock , knock . God , don 't do that . That just never stops being funny , don 't you think ? Oh . Never . What are you doing here ? What happened with Vegas ? That was too easy . You didn 't . Just a little pocket money . Shouldn 't you be in college or something ? Don 't you want to be with people your own age ? Artie , I 'm not my own age . Come on . Writing English papers and going to frat parties ? Boring . I mean , at least here , you know , there 's a challenge . That there is . You up for it ? The question is , geezer , are you ? Oh . You are so out of your league . What kind of artifact could cause a gas explosion ? I thought we were gonna get a break . Did you ask Artie ? Yeah . He laughed for about five minutes . I guess that 's an answer . You know , I 'm not asking for two weeks in Tahiti , you know ? I just want a couple days to get out of Podunk , Dakota , and go someplace that serves martinis . Well , you are looking pretty ragged . You got those bags under your eyes and ... What ? I 'm supporting you , here . It 's very helpful . Thanks . Ow ! Secret Service . That 's a big-ass generator , huh ? Mmm-hmm . I count six body bags . Excuse me , can I see this body , please ? Oh , God . Kentucky Fried , extra crispy . Thank you . Can I help you ? Hi . I 'm Agent Bering . This is Agent Lattimer . Captain Powell . Secret Service ? What went down here last night ? An underground gas main ruptured . It ignited . City engineers are checking to see if it 's safe to go down there . Until then , that 's all I know . Thanks for stopping by . Hmm . I think I have more questions . You ? Let 's go meet the engineer . Let 's . You get through ? Hello ? Hey . It 's us again . Look , General , I 'm going to need a list of all the casualties and a list of all the witnesses to the accident . Well , it 's pretty much the same list . Half a dozen suspects haven 't even been processed yet . All right ? We 're still trying to confirm the IDs . And I wasn 't here , but a desk sergeant and a duty officer got knocked out by the blast . One 's comatose and the other one 's in surgery . I 'm sorry to hear that . Good . So maybe now you 'll let me get to the ton of paperwork I have ahead of me . Hey . So , what do you think ? Is it safe to go down there ? Yeah . There 's not much to see , but it appears to be structurally sound . Mmm . It 's dark . Thanks . Okay . So , this must have been a cellar they sealed up when they built the police station . Uh-huh . Huh . You got a vibe ? No . Something else happened . Check this out . The explosion must have blown this door open . Pete ? Wow . I guess he 's been down here quite a while . Yeah . Secret Service . Myka . Uh-huh ? This guy was a Warehouse agent . Look , he has a Secret Service star , but his ID and his credentials are dust . I 'm sending for the body right now , okay ? And meanwhile , what I want you to do is I want you to get me pictures . Meanwhile , I am going to find who this agent is . I 'll ID him and I will find out , if I can , what mission he was on . It looks like the blast opened up the wall , and somehow , people were fried . I mean , could an artifact cause an explosion like that ? Or did the explosion release the artifact and then burn everybody up ? Well , that is a very good question , Pete , very good question . That 's exactly what you have to figure out . Bye . How the hell ? How the hell am I going to figure out who that mysterious agent is ? Unfortunately , the Warehouse filing system never quite caught up to the computer age . Like your wardrobe . Yeah , could ... What ? These are earth tones . They never go out of style . The files on all the Warehouse agents for the last 200 years , give or take . And missing agents , too , somewhere . Excellent . You can teach me about scrapbooking . Yeah . Okay , I 'll call you if I need you . All right , all right , I 've got my own stuff . Besides , I 'm allergic to old . Hey , Myka just sent pics from the scene ! Yeah , no , we 're getting the actual body later today , so we don 't need that digital crap . Digital 's just as good , Artie . No , you know what ? Welcome to the new millennium . Pixels will never replace the real thing . Pixels , you know what they are ? They 're just ... Look , they 're a start , but they 're ... God , they 're a really small start . But they don 't have to be . What ? They can be so much more . I 've been working on something , okay ? I really want to show you . No , I really , really don 't need any kind of newfangled ... Chill . This is totally old-fangled . Check it out . What ... What ... What is ... Is that ... Is part of that a Bell + Howell Spectroscope ? Surprise . I repurposed it . What ? Without asking me ? What ? It 's just a hologram projector . It 's perfectly safe . Now behold ... No . No . I don 't need to behold . Can we behold a whole other time ? See , I 've composited all of Myka 's pictures , and ... Wait . No . No , no , hold on . No , I know this works . Yeah . I 'm sure it 's fabulous . Can we just do this at a more appropriate ... Percussive maintenance . Wait , it gets better . What did you ... What did you do ? I upgraded the whole megillah . Strung together a bunch of Haswells on a Cray XT backbone I found in the Warehouse . I mean , I guess keeping me around here wasn 't the worst idea you ever had . What is that ? Is that a tattoo on what 's left of his skin there ? Could be . Can you zoom in a little ? Okay . Yeah . Yeah , I can 't ... I can 't ... Could you digitally reconstruct that ? Couldn 't any genius whiz kid ? Okay , you do that . I 'll be in the records room . " Really brilliant job , Claudia . Love the initiative . " " Oh , thank you . Thanks , Artie . " So , nothing on the tapes , like I said . You know , I 'm really enjoying our time together . These are the personal effects from the suspects who died in the accident , right ? Yeah . And processing them has a very low priority right now . Yeah , but whoever started the job put out seven trays . Yeah ? There were only six bodies . Son of a bitch . Son of a bitch . Everybody , drop what you 're doing right now . Which means we might have a survivor or a witness . Or a guy with an artifact that fries people . Reggie Hinton , where are you now ? Look , buddy , give me some of that . Reggie ? Shut up . We gotta get out of here , y 'all . Now . He 's coming after us , all of us . Who is ? Just come on , y 'all . We gotta get out of here , now . Reggie ! Wait , Reggie ! Let 's go . Reggie , who is this guy ? It 's him ! It 's consistent with a fast , hot fire . The same as the bodies in the station . Except this time , no gas leak . Looks like they were microwaved . We ID 'd this one as Reggie Hinton , your suspect . What killed these guys ? Why is this not ... - Okay , it 's an eagle . - Yeah ! And an anchor . Uh-huh . And just a circle , I guess . Could it be a globe ? Yeah . Why not ? Okay , so , eagle , anchor , globe . He 's a Marine . He 's a Marine . That 's gonna narrow it down . I mean , there 's only like a dozen or so agents that were former Marines . So , you know , we can ... Yeah . There are more bodies . They 're burned to a crisp again , but there 's still no sign of an actual fire . No fire ? Wait a minute . No fire . Okay , so , there was ... There was some Babylonian battery . It was unearthed and then lost again in 1952 in Texas , not Missouri . But there was also a rumor that Edward Teller was working on a micro-fission thing , but I don 't think that that ... Well , here 's a wrinkle . There 's a handprint on the bodies . It 's the only part not burned , and our only suspect was one of the victims . It was like he was , I don 't know , followed from the police station , Artie . No , no , no . Not like he was followed . He was chased . I don 't think that these deaths are random . So , maybe somebody at the station last night found the artifact , whatever it is , and used it to settle some old scores . Yeah , okay , you know what ? You trace the victims , you see if they 've got any enemies , then maybe you can get ahead of this guy before he settles more scores . Okay ? Bye . Yeah . If that 's what it was , which I doubt , you know . Would it have killed you to leave a note ? Captain Powell . Yes ? Did you know that every one of these burn victims were members of the same gang ? And they were brought in the other night after an altercation with a rival gang . I mean , could this be payback ? That 's just what we need , a turf war with a new kind of weapon in play . Okay , we 're gonna need names , addresses , whatever you 've got . The head of our gang unit , Sergeant Clark , is out on leave . As soon as I get in touch with him , I will put him through to you . And this is Clark , huh ? Until then , this is his latest stuff . Will you need a blue-and-white escort ? No , no , we can handle it . Good . ' Cause I really can 't spare one . I think he 's starting to warm up to us , you know , a little . I can 't ... It 's not ... Your uncle staying the weekend or just the night ? Yeah , he just arrived . This is actually the missing agent . It 's a little bit better than a hologram or pixel , isn 't it ? If you 're into that kind of thing . Yeah , well , you know , I 'm trying to scan it with this dingus you made , and I can 't connect it ... Hold on . May I ? Seriously . Yeah , well . Just do that , but go slower . All right . Wow me with your 3D . Hey , I don 't appreciate the tone , young man . Yeah . A little speed would be good . People are actually dying . Yeah . Go . Nice . Okay ? This is what I 'm saying . Wow . Okay . So ... He 's kind of cute for an old-timey guy . Okay . Okay . No . No . No . No . Welcome back to the Warehouse , Jack Secord . Joined the Marines in ' 48 , recruited to the Warehouse in ' 55 . Last known location , Minneapolis . That 's a long way from St. Louis , Louis . Five , four , eight , four . Here , put these on . What are we , going into surgery ? Just do as you 're told , please . Okay . Oh , Jack Secord , living quarters , personal effects , sealed 6l22l62 . Holy Bed Breakfast , Batman . This is Leena 's . No , no . This is the Warehouse , but yes , it is Room 5 of the Bed Breakfast , but still the Warehouse . See , whenever a Warehouse agent , if he disappears or if he dies ... Hey , are you listening to me ? Yeah . If he dies mysteriously , then , you know , living quarters , personal effects , they 're collected , they 're preserved right here . So he smoked . A lot . Hey , it was the ' 60s . Everybody smoked . What 's this ? What 's what ? " I 'll be in town in a few days . Until then ... " Are there envelopes ? No . So , there 's no addresses ? No . Maybe he thought somebody was reading his mail . Well , you know , it was the Cold War , probably somebody was reading his mail , but girlfriends weren 't against the rules , unless ... Wait , girlfriends ? Yeah . It 's female writing . See ? You can still smell the perfume . Oh . So , was that like an old-school booty call ? Yeah , before there was texting , grasshopper , there was a time when people actually did put pen to ... You know what ? That 's the ticket . Here , you know , it 's not what he got , it 's what he actually wrote . The indentations left behind . Oh , sweet . Yeah , product of a misspent youth . And that is ... Rebecca . And where do you live , Rebecca ? Is that St. Louis ? Yeah . St. Louis . Well , what do you know , Jack Secord ? You actually did leave a note . Rad . Rebecca Saint Clair ? I 'm Agent Lattimer . This is Agent Bering . We 're with the Secret Service . Oh , my . How can I help you ? Would you mind if we came inside ? Well , sure . Thank you . Ma 'am , we 're just in the middle of an investigation , and a body was found today . A body ? Yes . In the personal effects of the deceased was this address . Oh , my God . You found Jack . So , you knew him ? Jack Secord , yes . I knew him quite well . Where did you find him ? Well , he was ... He was sealed up underground . We 're very sorry . Do you remember if he mentioned any strange occurrences before he went missing ? Jack really didn 't talk about his work . Is this connected with that awful thing that happened at the police station ? No . Yes . We 're really not at liberty to say , but if you have anything , if you know anything , no matter how seemingly insignificant , it would be very helpful . Would you like some tea and cookies ? No . Yes , please . Yeah ... I ... Yeah ... I just ... I love cookies . He does . Let me put on a kettle . Okay . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . What are you doing ? Establishing a rapport , you know , making her feel comfortable . I think she knows something . Is that a vibe or do I hear your stomach growling ? I haven 't eaten since last night , okay ? Unbelievable . Unbelievable . Those look great . Thank you . The tea will be here in a minute . Thank you . I 'd just like to ask you , when his body was found , was there anything strange about ... Agent Bering . Good cookie . What ? When ? What 's the address ? Thank you . Pete . It happened again . Same condition ? Uh-huh . Okay . I 'm sorry , ma 'am , but we 've got to go . Thank you so much for everything . I 'm sorry . Just ... I won 't ... Pete , don 't take them all . Okay . That one is ... Have more people been electrocuted ? Listen , we 're very sorry , but we really can 't talk about it . Thank you . Thank you . - Let go of me . - Take it easy , kid . Don 't touch me , you stupid pig . Stop . Take it easy . Watch yourself . Just don 't kill me . Okay , look , we 're not here to hurt you , okay ? We just want to ask you a few questions . No . The cops that killed him are going to kill me , too . What do you mean , " like him " ? Like who ? The killer guy . Are you saying a cop did this ? Five-0 walked right up and started burning people . I was just over there . I don 't know , it was crazy . What 's going on ? Who 's this ? Some witness . He says a cop did this . Yeah ? They never say that . He 's probably covering for a gang he wants to join . Hey , get the hell out of here . Look , have all of your officers checked in after the explosion ? No . But only Clark is out , the head of the gang unit . Why ? Because he needed to decompress . He lost his temper in an interrogation . So , these bodies , these gang members , fall under his jurisdiction ? Well , of course . But like I said ... He 's on RR . Right . He 's on RR . Right . Could we get his address ? We could use his expertise . Give me a second . So , the volatile lead of the gang unit is on mandated leave . While gang members get mysteriously killed by what looks to be a cop . What do you think ? Two plus two equals four ? Have you ever stopped by the office on your day off ? No , but I 'm sure you have . Hmm . Sergeant Clark and I call it dedication . You hear that ? Look at that . Sergeant Clark , federal agents ! Open up ! One , two , three , go ! Sergeant Clark ! Hey , hey , hey , Clark ! Oh , my God , what is that ? Clark , no ! Come on . He went down here ! There ! He 's dead . Help me . That thing , it 's gone . Go ! Okay , just tell me that Clark 's body is on the way to me right now . No . Powell took it . For God 's sakes . You know , I just don 't have time to play bureaucracy games to get it back . Well , I sent you a bunch of pictures that Claudia asked for . Yeah , great , pictures . Got them . There was something on his back , Artie . Some kind of a nasty metallic lobster-Iooking thingy , and it 's gone now . Okay , so , maybe , you know , if we find out what that thingy was , then we can track where it went . And you say that it also leaves a body when the body dies , maybe . Okay , that 's a good start . Please , tell me that you have something else . Well , it looked like it was fused to his back . Okay . Hold on , hold on , hold on . I got an idea . Yes , let 's do it right now . Now . Come on . Come on . Right . Right away . Just do it . One , two , three . Go do your thing . Do your thing . All right , talk to me . It gave off arcs of electricity . It must be how he burned those people . You got it ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . All right . So , the electricity , did it emanate from Clark or from the artifact ? Both . Okay , you know what ? So that just eliminates our last possibility . All right . Just ... Did it have buttons ? Did it have wires ? Did it have an antenna ? Hey , Artie . Yeah ? Digital rendering shows Jack had something on his back , too . Okay , just ... All right , can you guys hear me ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Okay . Attached to the vertebra at T2 , 4 , 7 and 9 and accesses the spinal cord , I think . I can 't really tell . Listen to me . Jack Secord , when he died , did not just have this artifact with him , he had it on him . I mean , this thing was like some kind of a ... It 's like a parasite . Well , dude , Ripley 's Believe It or Not , same markings on Clark 's back . All right , did you get that ? Clark 's back , too . So , what powers it , Artie ? I mean , it must be drawing electricity from somewhere to electrocute people the way it did . Yeah , okay , I 'll just add that to our already-huge list of questions . Thank you . All right . Goodbye . What ? Why are you making that face ? What ? You got something ? Electrocution . That 's the word Rebecca used , but we didn 't know it did that yet . We hadn 't figured it out . Oh ! Mmm-hmm . I see more cookies in my future . Of course you do . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You asked if there were any more electrocutions . What exactly did you mean by that ? I heard it on the news . No . It was never mentioned in the news . Ma 'am , you know more than you 're saying . Okay . Let 's cut to the chase , shall we ? You didn 't come in from D.C. The unexplained electrocutions raised a flag . You found Jack , and you finally figured out there was an artifact . You 're from South Dakota , right ? This artifact that Jack was hunting for before he disappeared , it 's active again . Am I correct ? You weren 't just his girlfriend . You 're a Warehouse agent . Welcome to the conversation . Okay . Come here . I mean , this is it . Ew . Oh , that 's definitely a nasty lobster-Iooking thing . And what is ... It 's electrocution , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Wait . What was that writing ? This one . Okay . See , this ... This writing is very old . I have no idea what that writing is . You want me to , you know , scan it in ? Do my thing ? You go , girl . Don 't . Sorry . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Wrong . You left before I could be certain you were Warehouse . I wanted to share this with you , what I dug up back then . What I think Jack was following . There 'd been several unexplained deaths , burned bodies . It started at a museum shortly after an 11th-century exhibit passed through . I couldn 't find a connection . But Jack had vibes about these things . Very annoying . He must have started to investigate , and then ... Then he just disappeared . I always knew if we didn 't quit , one of us , one day , would lose the other . But , for Jack , the Warehouse was his first love . Till death do them part . I scoured the crime scenes , but I never found any answers . You never went back to the Warehouse ? I couldn 't do that . Changed my last name , just disappeared . I stayed in St. Louis , hoping to find him one day , maybe lost , confused . Eventually , my life was here . Myka , does this look familiar to you ? That 's what we saw on Clark 's back . That 's the device . That 's Jack 's handwriting . Jack knew what he was looking for . Are you still using that old thing ? Yeah , right ? Okay , can you see this ? This is what you 're looking for . It 's called the Spine of the Saracen . Okay . Great . So it has a name . What is a Saracen ? Saracen 's a Turk . Now listen , there 's a legend that during the first Crusade the Turks had this elite warrior-cult . And these warriors were rumored to be unstoppable , for some reason , in the field of battle . What I 'm thinking is that this Spine , can you see this ? The Spine was specifically designed as a weapon for these warriors . Eleventh century , it 's the same as the museum exhibit . What exhibit ? Well , we found pictures , too . Something happened at a museum exhibit that Jack Secord stumbled on . Rebecca showed us this . So , maybe this thing was sealed and it got out somehow . Okay , so , if we find it , how can we stop it ? Yeah , okay . Well , I 'm deciphering the text right now . It 's a little difficult , but I 'm trying . It 's the words under this drawing and , loosely translated , it says , " The Spine requires a lifetime commitment . " Oh , yeah , I had a girlfriend like that once . So , this thing must get its power from somewhere , right ? So , if we shut down its source , can we stop it ? Yeah . Well , you know , when I figure it out , you know what ? You 'll be the second to know . So this Spine , you know , it 's probably still at Clark 's apartment . So we should get there before somebody else finds it . Now , Jack was a very good agent , the best . You be careful . Yeah , we will . Okay , so the last time we saw Clark alive , he ran into this alley . So we should start here ? Well , unless you want to look under the arch . No ! No ! What is that ? Help me ! Help me ! Hey ! Hold it ! Hey , hey , hey , hold it , hold it , hold it ! He 's trying to kill me ! Bring the gun here ! I shot him ! I shot him in the chest and he just kept coming at me . Who 're you talking about ? He 's ... Okay , now would be a good time to take the shot . Okay , that didn 't work . Pete ! No , but the good news is we pissed him off ! Okay , stop it . We 're on your side ! Please , help me ! Please , help me ! Vince ! What happened ? Is he ... He 's gone . He was my ex-husband . There was a restraining order , but I 've never seen him ... Wait , it 's gone . But how ? Ma 'am , get out of the area now ! Now ! Pete ! Do you see it ? No . Do you ? No . Look out ! Pete ! Pete ! Pete ! Oh , my God ! Pete , don 't move ! I 'm okay . Okay , just let me call Artie ! All right ? Just let me ... No , stay away . I don 't want to hurt you ! Agent Bering ? Agent Bering ? Agent Bering ? Are you okay ? Where 's Pete ? I don 't know . He 's not here . What happened ? Same thing that happened to Clark and Jack , it 's happening to Pete . I have to go find him . Hang on a second . You were knocked out . We need to call an ambulance . I 'm fine , okay ? Just excuse me . I have to go . The Spine was designed for one thing . It turns a person into a killing machine . It 's a warrior-maker . It uses the body like a big battery , heightening and redirecting the host 's natural electrical impulses . Yeah . It 's like ancient PCP . It jacks up your adrenaline and testosterone , so on a scale of one to 10 , you 're about a 25 . Until the battery is drained . Then the bars retract . It lies dormant , just waiting for the next nearest living host to latch onto . Artie , the Spine is on Pete . Okay , where is he right now ? I don 't know . Just tell me that you can remove it . We will . We will . Just ... There 's a way . There 's always a way , Myka . Artie , listen to me , I can 't ... I will not lose another partner . The look in Pete 's eyes , Artie , he looked ... I 've never seen him so angry . That 's not Pete . That 's the artifact . It 's just ... It feeds on aggression . It makes you go after what you hate , right ? Clark went after the gangs and the last victim went after his ex-wife . A warrior that 's been programmed to kill his enemies . Jack fought it . He fought his feelings long enough so that he could seal himself up and not hurt anyone . What are you saying , Myka ? You think Pete is going to do exactly the same thing ? I don 't know . Artie , what do I do when I find him ? What have you got , Claudia ? Just tell me anything you 've got . Okay , hold up . So , when this thing was built , electricity didn 't exist yet , right ? Right . So it zapped people , but what would happen if it got zapped ? I mean , that 's what the bolt of lightning was in the picture that they found . Remember , Jack wrote , " Hand of God . " " Hand of God . " Maybe that 's what shuts down the Spine , a bolt of lightning . Bolt of lightning . Overwhelming the spine 's receptors might make it automatically detach . That 's not bad . Just turn the Tesla 's power to full . No . Artie , look , we already tried that . All right , listen . Myka , find Pete . Your Tesla 's not strong enough , so you 'll have to find a powerful electrical source , somehow , somewhere . He 's going to take a bullet . What ? That 's what we 're trained to do , isn 't it ? Every Secret Service agent will take a bullet for the President , for his country . That 's what Jack did . He sacrificed himself . That 's what Pete 's going to do now . No . Because Pete knows that the Spine will just latch onto another person . Then he 's going to make sure . That 's what Jack did . Agent Bering , your partner , Lattimer , two of my men just saw him headed back to the station house . What ? Why would he ... The generators . He 's found his bolt of lightning . Lattimer . Lattimer ! Stop ! Get out ! Captain , wait ! Wait ! Look , it channels anger , okay ? You have to go outside . Please , just go . Pete , it 's going to be okay . Okay ? Artie can fix this . The Spine requires a lifetime commitment . You can 't help me . Yes , I can . Okay ? You just have to ... No ! I can feel it ! This thing is stronger than I am . I don 't think I can fight it much longer . Yes , you can . Yes , you can ! Okay , we can find a solution . We can lock you up until we find an answer . Like Jack ? Buried for all those years to have that thing come back to life ? No ! It 's gotta end here . I have to die . And I have to take the Spine with me . You understand , right ? Pete ... Take these and clamp them to the Spine . I tried , but I can 't reach . If I miss , I 'll just kill myself and it 'll attach to its next victim , Myka . You 've got to do this . Pete , I can 't . Please ! Please . Pete , listen to me . Pete ! You will come back . Do you hear me ? You will . Do it . Come on , Pete . Don 't leave . Come on , Pete . Come on ! Don 't leave ! Oh , God ! Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm okay . God ! Man , this trip really killed me . Could you not ... Could you stop that , please ? Seriously , I am totally dead . Yeah , I 'm surprised to see you alive . Don 't ... Don 't encourage him . I have but one life to live for my ... Oh , no , wait . All right , you know how I felt when you were actually close to ... Artie ? So , when you ... Oh . This is Rebecca . Right , right . Wow . This is quite an honor . Hello , I 'm Artie . Hello . Absolutely . I can take care of that . Place hasn 't changed very much . Yeah ... I 'm working on that . Claudia Donovan , Warehouse 13 , next generation . Thank you very much , Claudia . Thanks . Oh , I ... Well ... Okay . Thank you . So ... I was wondering ... We could always use an extra pair of hands . " Use , " that 's the perfect word . Like I said , this place hasn 't changed very much . And it never will . It hates to let go of anything . Thank you , but no , thank you . I came here to complete Jack 's mission . Now , I 'm going home . I understand . Oh , right . Rebecca , there is one last thing that you might be interested in seeing . Just like he left it . His lucky lighter . Oh . Rebecca , there 's something in here , in Jack 's desk that Claudia found that obviously belongs to you , so ... " Rebecca and Jack . " Together forever . " Yeah , I 'm going to give you a minute here . I guess Jack chose you over the Warehouse after all . Get out of here , while you have time . While you still have a life left to live . This place , it 's like the Spine . It 'll use you up . Excellent . Oh ? Oh . So , you want a piece of me ? Is there anything you don 't play with ? Um ... No . Lift the point . Off the floor . Sorry . Put it down , put it down . Yes . Gently . Blade up . What ? Blade up . Thank you . Sorry , sorry , sorry . Sorry , Artie . That is really cool . Thank you . We try . You made this ? In record time , too . With the help of things . This is a copy of the finest samurai sword ever forged . The Honjo Masamune , owned by the ruling family of Japan for centuries before it disappeared . The real one , unearthed a few weeks ago . Dig site in Okinawa . The real one . Which does what ? Which will arrive in D.C. First thing in the morning in order to be presented as a gift to the President , but it 's not gonna happen , because you two are gonna intercept it at the Japanese embassy . That wasn 't what I meant . No , I know what you meant , but you 've gotta pack and you 've gotta catch a plane and it really doesn 't matter , does it , what the real sword does , because you remember , snag it , bag it and tag it . Well ... Get snagging , bagging and tagging . You 're off to swap a Masamune for an Artie Nielsen . What ... Get out . Okay . Too many questions . It was never boring working with you people . Back and forth , back and forth . One day your government wants me , the next , I 'm a crackpot . Your own partner said to me , " Never again . " Even then I knew . One day , one of you would be back to place an order . Huh ? That better be cash , American credit ain 't what it used to be . Hey , what 's that ? Another gadget for me to tinker with ? Wait . I did what you asked ! Lots of eyes to make the switch here . I guess night 's our only option . White House won 't be any easier . I 'd feel a lot more comfortable doing it before it gets anywhere near the President . It 's ridiculous that we don 't know what we 're protecting him from , but typical Artie . I mean , I understand grabbing an artifact before it causes trouble , but he couldn 't spare two seconds to warn us about what we 're walking into ? Look , I 'm sure if it were really dangerous , Artie would have told us . Let 's go , let 's go . Wait , wait , wait , go ... Go back , go back . What exactly happened there ? You tell us , Artie , okay , because the Japanese sure as hell don 't know . They 're testing for everything , from dirty bombs to gas leaks . They won 't let us in the room . They 're holding us in the lobby . They 're treating us like suspects . Suspects ? Why ? Did you have the decoy sword with you ? No , but they 're not even looking for the sword , Artie . They 're not even sure whether or not it was taken . Okay , that makes no sense to me whatsoever . I mean , either it 's gone or it 's not gone . You said you saw somebody leaving . Did he have it ? I don 't know , okay ? 'Cause I was about two seconds away from passing out . Yeah , but what did this guy look like ? Not female . Look , Artie , my Japanese sucks , but it sounds to me as if they think that the sword was vaporized or something . What do you mean vaporized ? What do you mean , by the bomb ? There was no bomb , Artie . Nothing blew up . There was no victims that were brought out or dead bodies or ... There was nothing . I don 't understand . Nothing blew up ? That 's the weird part . It was like a bomb , only backwards , okay ? Instead of blowing out , it yanked everything in . Implosion ? Artie ? Artie ? Did the sword do this ? And if it did , can I reconsider this mission ? It didn 't . And what you have to do is you have to get in that room and tell me exactly what you see . That 's a look I don 't know . It 's called the past rearing its ugly head . So , in other words , the sword didn 't do whatever happened at the embassy . But you know what did . Oh , God , I hope not . Artie , where are you going ? Don 't know that yet . But first I have to ... Pete . Yeah . Here we go . Round two with Mr. Congeniality . Mr. Ogawa , look , we 've answered all your questions , and now we have a few for you . Actually , Agent Bering , I have one more . Why does the Secret Service need to send two different units to inspect the same gift ? Two different ... I 'm quite certain that they will have the same question . On the QT is one thing , but you 're tramping through my backyard , literally tripping over my agents , and you don 't even give me a heads-up ? We have explicit instructions not to contact you anymore . Artie Nielsen . Look , it 's not like we can 't have coffee now and then . We just can 't have you on speed dial . Look , I get it . For better or for worse , and I happen to think worse , you two are serving a new master . This isn 't your screw-up . It was his . It 's just that he doesn 't really play well with others , so much . So , this security officer , Ogawa , Japanese embassy . He 's waiting for my explanation of what you were doing , and if you had anything to do with whatever the hell that was . Any suggestions what I 'm supposed to tell him ? All right , do me one favor . Get on a plane and leave D.C. While I can still let you . Can I at least have that ? Be out of here as soon as possible . I don 't think this is what Dickinson had in mind . Well , what are we gonna do ? We 've got to get into that room . You know , a room that 's losing evidence as we speak . I know . It 's just I thought coming back to D. C. Would feel like old home week or something . Home is overrated . God ! What are you doing here ? Uncool , Artie . Uncool , Artie . I had a hunch about something from Pete 's description . I just need to see this with my own eyes . You two have a plan to get in there ? Yes . We 're gonna crawl ... There 's an access panel under the motion sensors on our belly on the roof . We go in through ... What ? Please , ladies first . No , you know what ? You ... You be the smart one this time . Okay , get this . There 's an access panel on the roof . It 'll bring us in right above the main wiring for the security system . Now , if we crawl on our bellies , we can avoid the motion sensors ... What do you mean , " This time " ? All right , I get the idea . If I may ... Well , I didn 't ... Put these on . Really , or you 'll be of no use to me . Let 's go . I 'm going to look like Kermit the Frog . God , Artie , stop doing that ! I 've gotta tell you , Myka , those really bring out your eyes . This is a 14th-century Chinese firework known as an Ice Flower . Very few ... Very few like it left . Now ... Do not tell Mrs. Frederic that I did this , all right ? All right , we 've got about 10 minutes , more or less . Let 's go . The light pattern triggers a feedback loop in the optic nerve that mesmerizes the viewer . They won 't remember a thing . Whoa , Freaky McFreakerson ! So , it 's some sort of reverse chemical reaction ? Yeah . Okay . Take these off , just don 't look directly through the window . This was made by an implosion grenade . It removes matter from the center of a space and pulls everything , obviously everything , directly towards it with a violent force . This explains why they couldn 't find the sword . It could be in there . Oh , no , no , no , no . No . The sword , long gone . Stolen . This was used by the thief as a cover . So the guy that I saw ... Yeah , the guy you kind of saw ? The guy that I saw leaving must have stolen the sword and hidden in this room over here when he set off the bomb . I collected these grenades years ago . Every last one of them . I know I did . So wait , whoever stole the sword has other things that belong in the Warehouse , which would mean that we have competition . I don 't know . Artie , just how long is this list of things we don 't know ? I don 't know . About twice as long as the list of things that I don 't know about , all right ? Well , who else would have these implosion grenades , Artie ? I mean , if you collected them all ? Well , whoever it is , if he 's willing to use this to cover his tracks , then it 's somebody that 's ... What 's a darker word for dangerous ? If he did this to steal the sword , he 'd have no trouble killing anyone who got in his way . Oh , none at all . None at all . Next time , don 't get a suite , just a room . Okay , the lead here is the implosion grenade . We find out who had one of those , and then we find out who has the sword . Okay , let me just ... What , is there a listing for implosion grenades ? Those were the days . Artie , we 've got Wi-Fi . No , no , no , I like paper . Actually , I hate paper , but , you know , it 's a security issue ... Okay , Artie , enough . You have to fill us in , okay ? If the competition used an implosion grenade to steal the sword , then what the hell does this sword do ? Yeah , I mean , it must be pretty major , right ? You don 't drop a nuclear bomb to steal a butter knife . Exactly . Okay , you want to know about the sword ? I 'll tell you about the sword . The Honjo Masamune is much , much more than a dull knife . It kept the ruling shogunate in power for hundreds of years by making them invincible in battle . And the beauty is the way these things were forged . I mean , ritually . Hammered and folded the blade , millions of layers of steel with a carbon content that 's right off the charts . And each layer only atoms , atoms thick . I mean , this sword is said to be perfectly aligned . So , what does it do ? Yeah . Okay . You know how geese fly in a V formation , and the wind hits the first bird and then splits and then keeps on splitting wider and wider ... Right , sure , of course . ... with each successive bird . 'Cause it makes it easier for the birds to fly that way . Good , so what does the sword do ? The blade in this particular sword is said to be so perfect that light splits in its path and goes around the person holding it . Are we talking about invisibility ? Well , kind of , in effect . No , the person 's still there , although , you know , the light that we see doesn 't hit ... Yes , invisibility . Awesome . I knew ! I knew that was possible . I knew it . Okay , invisible swords now . Hey , Artie , these are the same sword , right ? Yeah . They don 't match . What ? Well , you see the disc thing that 's attached to the grip , well , it 's in the painting , but it 's not in the sword from the dig site . It 's missing its tsuba . This piece right here is called the tsuba . It 's actually a collectible in its own right , you know , separate from the sword , but this is missing its tsuba . Then the sword might not even work . And if it doesn 't , the guy 's gonna come looking for it . We are in a race . We 're in a race . You two have to find what happened to that tsuba , and fast . Artie , we 're looking for a 500-year-old sword . Eight-hundred , exactly , so it should be easy . You guys follow the tsuba , I will follow the implosion grenade , and one of us will find the thief . But wait , I mean , where are you going ? Well , somebody is making new grenades , somebody who promised not to . Again he doesn 't answer . And no goodbye . This is impossible . Well , keep at it , though . You 're the smart one . What are you doing What ? What are you doing ? Nothing . You 're doing great . Hello ? Leena , hey . Hey , is Claudia there ? Okay , she won 't be able to find it either . Claudia 's out . It 's just me . Okay , well , you 'll do . Flattered . Sorry . Listen , Leena , you know that 800-year-old sword that we were swapping out ? Well , it turns out a piece of it has come up missing , so if you were standing next to Artie , all right , and he was looking for this thing , what would he be doing ? Artie did say that the sword was from the Edo period , so instead of trying to track it forward from the past , just find it in the present . Identify any collectors that deal in that period and then try and find as much information as you can on any sales or transactions of those pieces . Right . Right . Right . Since you 're right there , do you think that maybe you could ... Give me a minute , Pete . One point , Lattimer . Thank you . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? You should have kept your promises , Erik . The tsuba , did you find it ? Well ... Well , it wasn 't easy . Yeah , it took some digging , but it turns out an antiques dealer had it in Tokyo in the 1920s . Now it 's here in Washington . Artie , it 's at the Secret Service . The ... What the hell 's it doing there ? Well , the Japanese government presented it in the 1920s to Woodrow Wilson as a symbol of peace . Guess that didn 't work out so well . And the curator at the Wilson Museum of Peace made the connection a couple days ago and offered it to be united with the sword at the gift ceremony . But freaky explosions tend to put the kibosh on ceremony , so it 's going back to the museum in the morning . The sword and the tsuba in D.C. At the same time ? No , no , no . That 's too much ... Too much coincidence . Well , Artie , we 're sitting on the Secret Service building , but look , if this thief is coming to get the tsuba , we have to warn Dickinson . No , no , absolutely not . Well , Artie , you saw what this guy 's willing to do . Yeah , and so did you , and imagine what he 's capable of with the sword . No , no , no , this thief is ruthless and smart . So if you warn the Secret Service and they do anything out of the ordinary , anything at all , then he will be tipped off . So you want to use him as bait . No , Artie , no . Hey , hey , hey , this is not a discussion . When I ... Hello ? Artie ? Artie ? Artie ? James . Okay , I think I know who this is , and I 've gotta go . Tail the agents , grab the tsuba , watch out for implosion grenades . Goodbye . Your agents , Bering and Lattimer , are compromised . Not possible . I ran a background check on Arthur Nielsen . Where 'd you get this information ? I have my sources . Same as you do . I don 't see how any of this is your business . The three of them returned to the embassy last night . Well , I 'm very sorry to hear that . I have no desire to stir up an international incident . It 's a great deal of paperwork , and a great deal of scrutiny . And you and I both get screwed . If you can 't handle this , I will be forced to take this to a higher authority . Everything all right ? Yes . Peachy . What ? The tsuba 's heading back to the museum . We 're heading out . Regards to President Wilson . Hi . It 's me . Artie . No , I know , I know . Look , please , do you think you could meet me ? Well , as soon as possible . Artie does to us what he 's making us do to them . He keeps us in the dark . For all we know , we 're decoys too . Look , we 're all pretty good at our jobs , okay ? We accepted the risk going in . Having intel in the fields keeps an agent alive , Pete , but Artie acts like keeping us alive isn 't a priority . To him we 're just ... Redshirts ? Yeah . First , he doesn 't think we 're redshirts . And second , that 's so cool you knew what I meant . Come on . He 's got a Tesla , too . Drop that weapon ! Are you okay ? Yeah . Grab the tsuba . You get a look ? Did we get it ? We got it . Yes . Now , give it back . Slowly . No . No , no , no . Did you see that guy with that gun ? It erases your short-term ... No . Never mind . What the hell is up with you two ? Now , who are you working for ? The Secret Service , but a department that you , sir , know nothing about . Yeah , I doubt that . Now , what department ? It 's an archival department . What , you 're filing clerks ? Running around shooting stun guns at your own people ? We didn 't shoot you . Right , filing clerks that protect us from invisible bad guys . Yeah . Pretty much . Yeah . Pretty much . Yeah . I 'll take it from here . Careful , Archives . Paper cuts ? They take days to heal . That 's hilarious . You 're hilarious . Very scared . So glad to see you . Thank you ... Not a damn word . Now , I warned you to back off before things got worse . Do you have any idea what this looks like ? Come on , you know we didn 't shoot at them . You know that we 're legit . Yeah , I do , but if you keep shutting me out , how am I supposed to back you up ? We 're just ... This stays with me until things die down . Or implode . What ? Sir , you 're putting yourself in serious danger . You have no idea what you 're dealing with . So tell me . We can 't . Well , I admire your loyalty . I prized it myself once , but you need to look at where you 're placing it right now . This has come to my attention . It checks out , and I will have to act on it . You want me to trust you ? Okay . If there 's even a remnant of a two-way street left , if you still trust that I 'm trying to look out for you , then read it . I want some extra people in the office , round the clock for the next 72 . Just in case . Why ? 'Cause he stole something dangerous and it 's important that I get it back from him . What makes you so sure it was him ? Call it a gut feeling . That 's still annoying , you know . What is ? You , talking in riddles and intuition . You never change . Yeah . So , has he , you know , contacted you ? I haven 't seen or heard from James in 15 years . And the irony 's not lost on me that you 're the one who 's asking . No , no , no , Carol , Carol , look at me . No matter what you think , I 'm not the one who drove him away . You made things intolerable , for all of us . Well , if it makes you comfortable to blame me then you should go ahead and blame me , I don 't care , but the truth is that you made choices , and the choices you made , you chose badly . I 'm not the one who disappeared . Oh , there it is . How did I not know ? What ? What ? Not know what ? Oh , stop it , Artie . You 're in town for whatever reason and you decide to twist the knife for old time 's sake . Rub it in that I chose the wrong guy . Right . You 're not the one who disappeared . You would have had to have been there in the first place . No , not Artie . All your secrets and your treasure hunts and that damn place . You know , James believed in life . You need to get one . Whoa , hold on , Carol , Carol . Carol . Could you please just ... Wait , wait , wait . What ? Listen , listen , Carol , if you 're harboring him in any way , you 're in danger . What are you doing here ? I was just about to ask you the same thing . Why are you bothering that poor woman and torturing yourself ? It 's called investigating a case . This isn 't the case . This is self pity . The case is the implosion grenade and the sword . And someone out there is running around using ... That 's right , someone , and that someone is MacPherson , and I can prove it . Remember ? Artie , we 've both seen you like this before . No , no , no , no , no . He planted this on purpose . He wanted me to find it . Otherwise he would have been much too careful . He 's taunting me . Would you listen to yourself ? You are leaping to wild conclusions based on nothing , and meanwhile your team is falling apart around you . They 're not falling apart . Myka and Pete are fine . Are they ? Did you know the tsuba 's now under Dickinson 's control ? Did you know Bering and Lattimer had been detained ? They 're at the hotel . I 'm taking you all off this case . Wait , wait , wait , what if I 'm right ? What if it is MacPherson ? Go home , Artie . Artie , where are you ? It doesn 't matter . New orders . You two stay in the hotel and you wait for me . I will take it from here . What 's the matter ? What 's wrong ? You okay ? Yeah . Everything 's fine . Okay . I don 't want to hear about it because it isn 't true . That isn 't Artie . I don 't want to believe it either , Pete , but it 's true . Yeah , well , you shouldn 't even be reading that . Pete . We should be out doing something . Pete , his real name isn 't even Artie Nielsen . It 's Artie Weisfelt . He used to work for the NSA . He was a cryptographer , a code breaker when he was in his 20s . They recruited him right out of school . They had him decoding Soviet communications . He intercepted letters , phone transcripts . Then they think he turned . He contacted one of the people they were spying on and he started selling secrets to the Russians . Then his file , it just ends . He was never prosecuted . We 've got a security breach . It 's like he just disappeared . But it 's him , Pete . What ? It 's definitely him . Freeze . You 're under arrest . No , no , no , listen to me . I have to take this . Lives are in danger and if ... No , no , not for that . Arthur Weisfelt , you 're under arrest for treason . Just tell us that the charges aren 't true . We both know . So just tell us . I can 't . They 're true . Okay , that 's not ... I had my reasons . Artie , Homeland Security is coming to pick you up . You need to give us a way to help you now . You need to concentrate on the mission and not worry so much about me . Mrs. Frederic fixed this once , and she can fix it ... This whole thing could have been avoided if you just told us anything about the sword , the tsuba , your past . Anything , Artie , we could have helped . We could have run interference with Dickinson , if you just trusted us . So what happens now , Artie ? I mean , what happens with the Warehouse ? I mean , what , are we in charge ? What ? I think we should know . She fixed all this , Mrs. Frederic . She fixed all of this years ago . It 's him , too . It has to be . Okay , Artie , this isn 't just about the treason , all right ? You also burglarized the Secret Service . I 'll spend a little time in prison . You 're not getting what is important here . I 'm not getting what 's important ? And the fact that I changed my name , which , by the way , I did so the Soviets wouldn 't find me , not to hide from our government . Important that Mrs. Frederic fixed all this . She expunged all the charges . Someone obviously unfixed it . Artie , focus . Oh , I 'm focused . Here 's the key . Who gave Dickinson my file ? Find out . That 'll take you directly to who has the sword , and that will lead you to MacPherson . Who Who ? Time 's up . Some friendly advice , it 's self-preservation time . Put in for transfers while this whole Warehouse business is still just a sidetrack in your careers . The scars don 't have to be permanent . Yeah , no can do . Just think about it . Meantime , I have some self-preservation to do , too . Now , I may not be your boss anymore , but until someone tells me otherwise , I still outrank you . So this time I am putting you on a plane with your best friends as an escort . Why is he here ? Ogawa ? The guy makes me itch . Well , Japanese want their tsuba back . With the sword gone , that 's all that 's left of a national treasure . Don 't worry . They 're leaving tonight for Japan . By tomorrow , the tsuba will be on the other side of the planet . By the way , just to ask it , who did give you that file on Artie ? That 's my secret to keep . Cooper , see that they get on their plane . No detours . Yeah , and don 't rule out shooting them if necessary . What 's going on ? What ? It 's Ogawa . It was him at the embassy . He walked out with the sword . Are you sure ? Myka , I saw him . You have to trust me . Dickinson looked at him when I asked him about the file . Artie was right . Yeah . And now he 's got the sword and the tsuba . Heading for the diplomatic terminal . There 's no security . How about you both just take a timeout , huh ? Just for the drive to Dulles . Let 's go . Bored ? Yeah . Oh , finally . Hi . Who 's Mrs. Frederic ? I 'd tell you , but then he 'd have to kill you . What do you think 6th to Constitution ? This time of day I 'd take 9th . Yeah , right . Want to grab a beer after we drop off ... Give me the gun . I can 't . In-laws are here , you know . Hang on , I want to pull over and grab a paper . They 'll be fine . Look , before you say anything , I know that I mangled this . I know I ran in there impulsively without thinking , without my bag , because I had a bigger ... Someone dug you up . So you know . It 's MacPherson . I 'm right . Yes , I 'm afraid you are . Now it 's up to you to stop him . Thank you . Don 't move ! So , Mr. Ogawa , when does he get here ? Oh , God , it works . Hello , Arthur . James . Good to see you after all these years . I wish I could say the same . Not while you 're pointing a gun at me , or trying to . Well , you know , you 're an invisible guy with a sword . I think you might have the advantage over me . My point exactly . So , what happened to you , James ? What happened ? I mean , I know we had our differences , and I know Carol happened . You always had your own ideas , your own objections to Warehouse policy , but I mean , James , James , killing people . When did you turn into that ? I woke up , Arthur . Once I was out from under Mrs. Frederic 's iron hand and your neuroses , I could see the world more clearly . Yeah , well , you know , that 's a little pathetic , isn 't it , James ? Blaming everybody else but yourself . I don 't think you 've found clarity . I don 't think your ego could stand the light . I 'd love to discuss this with you at length . You or one of your new agents . Lattimer and Bering , right ? I 've been observing them for some time . I see they have potential , but they 're so raw , so untrained , so corruptible . You come anywhere near them , I promise you , I promise you , James , that you 're gonna regret it . You 'll never get anywhere close to them as long as I 'm alive . Arthur , you can still read my mind . You always hurt the one you love . Artie ! No ! No , no ! Artie ? Yeah . Oh , my God . Okay , we have to get you to a hospital . What did you do to yourself ? Well , that was the only way I knew how to get the sword . What if we didn 't get here in time ? Yeah , I thought you would . So , right now , could you just hurry and pull it out ? Wait , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Now , wait a minute , are you sure ? Yeah , it 's the sharpest sword ever made . It should slide out just like butter . Just do it really , really , really , really fast . Okay ! Not like butter . No . Artie ! Pete . Is that one of those ... Yeah . I wasn 't here when everything went down between Artie and MacPherson , but I know it was bad . Here . Yeah , this feels right . Yeah , it must have been bad . I mean , all that stuff with Ogawa , giving Dickinson the file . He wanted more than the sword . He wanted to mess us up as a team . It worked . Well , I don 't know how to work with him right now . The thing about Artie is that he 's lost a lot of people in his life , including agents . So now he just shuts everybody out . It 's defense mechanism ... That 's not an excuse . It 's not a reason to keep secrets as compulsively as he does . It 's not meant to be an excuse , just an explanation . Artie acts like he doesn 't care , but he does , about you both . A lot . And that scares him . Well , I guess he needs to work that out , doesn 't he ? You know , just because he lost people , it doesn 't make us expendable . I 'm not a redshirt . I 'm not . She 's upset because I don 't communicate . Did she not notice the word " secret " in her job description ? Their job is to follow instructions . So is yours . You knew that I couldn 't let this go . As it turns out , I was right . I apologize for doubting you . Oh . Well , thank you . You know , we 're all human , as far as I know . You know that this was only MacPherson 's first move , and he 's planning something bigger . Any guesses what his plan might be ? No . I don 't know . I don 't want to wait to find out . You know what the Talmud says ? " If someone 's coming to kill you , " get up early , kill them first . " It also says , " Don 't rush into any unnecessary danger . " A miracle may not save you . "

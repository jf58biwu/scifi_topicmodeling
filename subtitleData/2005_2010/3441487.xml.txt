 we 're developing a human-interactive a.i. It 's going to change the world . Hello , mr . Ellison . My name is john henry . He taught it rules , but it 's got no ethics . You wanted to talk ? I don 't think i can do this anymore . What if i want out ? There is no out . Riley . Tell me about the metal , about the symbols . At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse . No windows , no way to see in or out . Where 's the metal ? John connor gave me a picture of you once . I didn 't know why at the time . You were young , like you are now . I always wondered what you were thinking in that moment . You seemed a little sad . Like you were remembering something long gone . I came across time for you , sarah . I love you . I always have . So , you got a car full of questions . Who shot her , for one . Deputy ... who 'd she shoot ? Good luck there ; she couldn 't even tell me the year . On your feet , soldier . Imagine that . No name ? No i.d. ? look , you just tell elvin that he 's gonna have to wait a bit . She 's not going anywhere . Not with her leg like that . You 're right . You are very right . She is staying put , and so am i . Suit yourself . Yeah . On your feet . Pain can be controlled . Come with me if you wanna live . Gun . Hallway 's clear . Go , go ! We need backup . Bullet 's still in your leg . Need to get that out . Can 't do anything until it 's gone . Call him . He can help . No way , i 'm not calling john . It 's too dangerous . Not john . Him . Call him . Please . You just got here . It 's an emergency . That 's john . His girlfriend tried killing herself in his bathroom . He 's taking her to the hospital . That 's awful . Hospital could be tricky . A lotta questions . I gotta go . I 'll keep you posted . And the girl ? How 's the girl ? Alive . What 's the status ? Paramedics got there before she lost too much blood . The hell were you thinking bringing her to the hospital ? Social workers , cops ... can 't believe you brought her here . I made the call . Live with it . Hey . Riley dawson . She all right ? That depends . Who are you ? John 's her boyfriend . Have you notified the family ? She 's in foster care , but i don 't think that we should call them . I think something 's up . Something bad . I see . Well , by law , i have to place her under a 5150 hold for the next 72 hours . Cps sends a caseworker out to evaluate her home situation , and they make the appropriate judgment . You 're gonna need to just stay put until cps arrives . Say it again . Listen to me , there 's a warehouse in the desert . A man , alan park , told me they 're building something there . Metal . Extracted from bricks of coltan like them , like the machines . Yeah , what did you see ? Doesn 't matter . Park is dead , reese . How bad is your leg ? There 's evidence of me all over the jeep . All over everything . Burn it . Burn it all . I talked to your mom . She found something out in the desert . Sounds like it has something to do with those three dots she 's been after . Is it real this time ? Well , the bullet in her leg sounds real . You stay . I 'll go . You made your call . This is what living with it means . She 'll be fine . I know that look . He 'll push you , and doubt you , and make you wanna kill him . He 's certainly on the list . He 's out of his time . He 's lost . John 's all he 's got . John and you . We 're all out of our time . We 're all lost . And john is all any of us have . You a doctor ? You have a name , right ? You can tell me your name . Inside , now . Okay , go . Don 't move . Sit down . Hey . Ease up . You need her . Reassure her . No time for games . I have a bullet in my leg . We need the hospital . Hospital 's no good for me . Why , did you hurt someone ? Not today . Not yet . Sarah . No , i didn 't hurt anyone . May i ? Hurry . Please . Who hurt you ? Today , i mean . It 's not your problem . Let her help you . She wants to help you . She 's a doctor for a reason . Figure it out . A man . One man ? God , sarah , what did it do to you ? Stabbed me . Trying to hurt me and make me scream . To get to our son . I 'm sorry . What ? This man . He 's in your life ? I 'm sorry . We had a fight . It went bad . Really bad . I ran . I can 't go to the hospital . Is he a doctor ? In law enforcement ? He 'll find me . He always finds me . What 's your name ? Sarah . My name is sarah . Elvin . Serial number on her gun was filed off . No idea where she got it . The gun . Not necessarily her gun . Powder burns . She sure shot it . Stand-up firefight , too , judging by the wound in her leg . And there 's this . Haven 't listened to it yet ? She hasn 't done anything yet . Hospital . Hello . Oh , hell . She 's still got a slug in her thigh ; it 's gonna make it hard to move real quick . Most people can 't even get that needle out . Let alone break that window or choke out a deputy . She is , as they say , accustomed to her circumstance . Just talked to the chief resident . Got a doctor who didn 't show for rounds today . Dr. Felicia burnett . Felicia . All right , get an apb out on her hybrid , check her house , check every parking lot within a five-mile radius . Our mystery woman 's got a problem . She 's gotta get that metal out . Okay . There are two things you need to know . First , this is going to hurt . Second , this is really going to hurt . You said you have a son . What 's his name ? I don 't wanna talk about my son . Women have higher pain thresholds than men . Especially women who 've been through childbirth . This is gonna be like that ? About like that . John . His name 's john . What 's he like ? Tell me about him . He looks like his father . He 's about the same height . He 's got my eyes . And you trust him . There 's a strength about him . I 'd die for john connor . I 'd die for my son . First big contraction . Breathe . Hi . How are you ? I feel like an idiot . You 're not an idiot . You 're just ... it 's okay . There 's really nothing to say . You 're here , too ? Of course . I 'm worried about you . Well , don 't be . Please . I 'm really tired . I 've had a long day . Yeah . Long day . Come on . You must be stronger than you imagine you can be . You must survive , or i will never exist . What is that ? I 've heard that before . John 's message to you . He made me memorize it before i came back . I 'm not strong enough . I 'm gonna die . Won 't be the first time . Reese ! Hey , hey . Who 's reese ? Is it out ? The bullet ? It 's not out . I can 't get it out . Not here . You 're lying . You were out for half an hour ; if i were lying , you 'd be in a hospital , handcuffed to the bed , with armed guards outside the door . She could 've given you up any time . She didn 't . The bullet 's dug in just over your femoral artery . You know what that is ? Yeah , i know what that is . Then you know if i nick it , you 'll bleed out and die in less than four minutes . So don 't nick it . You gotta trust me here . I need a picture of what is going on inside that leg . I need real instruments . You wanna go back ? No , not want . Need . I know what it is to be afraid . Hello , mr . Ellison . How are you today ? I 'm fine , thank you , john henry . Are those toys ? Yes . Mr. Murch brought them to me . He thinks these will help me develop fine motor control . They 're very interesting . This is toa tahu . The toa of fire . He wears the mask of shielding and wields the nynrah ghost blaster . He is sworn to defeat the makuta . I see . They have excellent range of motion in their limbs . It 's from the ball and socket joints . This body uses hinge joints in the knees and elbows . It 's less efficient . That body was meant to look like a person . It was made in our image . Oh . Whose image were humans made in ? God 's . We were made in god 's image . This body was made to resemble a particular human . This body appeared in red valley , new mexico in 1999 . It had a different appearance then . In 2007 , it kidnapped dr . Alistair fleming . Forced him to re-grow its organic covering . Then it forced a plastic surgeon named dr . David lyman to alter its face to resemble actor george laszlo . Then it killed 20 members of the federal bureau of investigation 's hostage rescue team in north hollywood . And then ... that 's enough . That 's enough , john henry . How do you know all this ? I wanted to know about this body 's history . So i accessed the internet , and used a simple search parameter . And what was that ? James ellison . Mr. Ellison , i have a question . What is it ? It 's not for you . I have a question for god . What do you wanna ask god ? I wish to know why he didn 't use more ball and socket joints when he made you . You 've given john henry access to the internet . John henry has many questions . Mr. Murch thought it would be a good idea to give him the capacity to look for answers himself . Well , he 's gotten very good at it . He 'd make a hell of a detective , actually . Still , it seems unwise . Who knows what he 'll find , or who may find him . You 're worried about outside forces influencing john henry ? I 'm worried about what he 's going to become . Who 's gonna guide him . Why , you are , mr . Ellison . You . Whew . There 's a lotta blood in there , some discarded medical equipment . Looks like someone tried to operate . Whoever was in there is long gone . Now what ? Don 't know . I 've never snuck into one before . This is crazy . Get the gurney . You know me in the future . What would future me do ? You mean about riley ? Yeah . What would future me do right now ? Future you has more important things to do . So this reese guy you were talking about . He did this to you ? No . That 's not completely true . And if it weren 't for me ... no . God , no . Reese is john 's father . And he 's dead . I 'm sorry . Look , can we just do this ? Okay . Right . I 'll come right back . Your leg . It 's bleeding again . I think it 's the bullet . I think it 's moving . It is . What did she say ? If the artery gets nicked , how long do i have ? Four minutes . Sarah ? Where are you ? In the morgue . Is that a joke ? Not a joke . I need surgery . A long story . The warehouse , did you find it ? Not yet . First thing 's first . That is the first thing . Cleanup is the first thing . We have a situation with you . We have a couple situations , actually . What ? Where 's john ? What 's wrong ? John 's fine . It 's his girlfriend . I think she 's turning into a problem . Been a problem . Yeah , i know . Reese , i , um ... i got a problem with this leg . I can tell . You called me . Twice . Sarah , you there ? Sarah ? Yeah . Yeah , i 'm here . Don 't worry about john . Hello , ms . Weaver . How are you today ? I 'm well , thank you , john henry . Mr. Murch said you asked for me . Do you know solek ? He resides in karda nui and idolizes the toa . He has stated that he 's best friends with takua . You 're not human . Excuse me ? You 're not human . You 're made of metal . Not the same metal as i am . But metal . How can you tell ? I looked into your eyes . There 's nothing there . Have you shared this with anybody ? Mr. Merch ? Mr. Ellison ? No . Should i ? No . You should not . This body contains a high percentage of processed tantalum niobium . Commonly known as coltan . The coltan in this body came from a mine in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . That 's very likely . I wouldn 't know for certain . In the last 26 months , zeira corp has obtained control of 7 % of the world 's coltan reserves . Is that so ? I have been scanning available sources for the keyword " coltan . " I detected this audio transmission on an unsecured line . Got a breach . Man shot out at heaton air . Damn . A breach ? Well , you know the drill . Shut the place down . Down ? Damn . I got 16 tons of coltan . You know the drill . Shut it down . I 'll call . And you detected that on an unsecured line ? During my scan , yes . Well , that was a mistake . Ms. Weaver . Yes . What are you doing ? I can 't answer that right now . But know this , john henry , everything i do i do for you . This thing is an arthroscope . Basically a camera in a tube . I need to stick it in your leg while i operate . Remember how it felt when i cut you open at the motel ? It 's gonna be worse ? I need to put you under . And i need you to hand over that gun . Hmph . Listen to me . That bullet isn 't a joke . This isn 't something you can tough your way through , it 's going to kill you . Do you understand ? I can 't stop . You 're not one of them . Gun . Listen , lady , you don 't ... i know . Better than you think . Now give me the gun , or i swear on a stack of bibles , i will let you die . Please give me the gun . Don 't worry , sarah . I 'm here . I 'm watching . Is everything all right ? I was about to ask you the same thing . She 's missing . We 're locking down the hospital and we 're searching room by room . I saw empty cargo elevators back there . I 'm gonna go see if she 's hiding . You check the parking lot and the exits . We need to find her . Now . No . " No " what ? No , we don 't need to find her . Jesse , please . Shut up . Not a word outta you . Found you in that tunnel , i scooped you outta that hell , and i brought you to paradise . And this is what you do . You 're bleeding , love . Let me take a look at that . There was this girl at school . She killed herself . John tried to save her . But the machine stopped him . He doesn 't like to talk about it . So this . This was all for his benefit ? Can i stay with you ? People are gonna be looking for you . Just for a little while ? An hour ? An hour . Careful . It 's rented . And make sure you take everything . Tomorrow at this time , it 's like we were never here . Turn around slowly , and keep your hands where we can see them . Do you mind telling me where you keep your demolition materials ? The sub-basement , perhaps ? No ? We come to a stop . At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse . There 's an office in front . No windows . Can i help you ? 9-millimeter discharge , semiauto , all from the same point of origin . That 's an execution . The gun we found in the jeep was a .45 . Different gun . But 9-millimeter matches the round in our girl . And no one on that tape shot back . Who were those people on the tape ? Well , someone knows . Of course , he 's got a .45 caliber hole in him . Copy everything we 've got . Send it to the fbi , the atf , and every police outfit inside 100 miles . Where you gonna be ? Out in the desert . Looking for a warehouse at the end of a dirt road . She 's covering her tracks ? She wouldn 't dare come here . Holy hell , elvin . A second shooter ? Could be . Whoever it was , he knows where she 's been , knows her condition , i bet he is looking for this . Go back and secure the office . Call the hospital . Tell ' em to keep their eyes open for strangers . Tell ' em to steer clear . Tell ' em i 'm coming . What kind of tree is that ? Apple , i think . No . No , i know this tree . As a child , derek and i ate fruit from it . That 's not true . You were never here . I saw an entire orchard on fire once . Skynet flamethrowers . Smelled like apple pie . It 's just a story . What are you doing ? Derek and i used to leave notes for each other . This tree was our marker . See ? I never lie to you . Never . Reese ? It 's okay , sarah . You 're okay . Hey , easy . Easy . I 'm here for her . I know why you 're here . Stay back , or i swear to god , you will regret it . You don 't wanna do that . You really don 't . You even know how to use that thing ? It 's tough to shoot with the safety on . You wearing body armor ? I am . Go away , elvin . Felicia . Put the gun down . Please . Go . Felicia . Baby . Please put the gun down . Felicia . Put the gun down , you crazy bitch , or i swear on a stack of ... elvin . Elvin ! Sarah . Sarah , we have to go . Reese ? Reese ? You 're reese ? Yeah . You 're not dead . Not yet . Are you the father ? John 's father ? No . No , he 's not the father . You realize this place is probably locked down . Deputies will be all over us . They 'll think i did this . All you have to do is let them . No , that 's not right . He pointed the gun at me , he put it up against my head , he wanted to kill me . Wouldn 't be the first time . Go . Sarah . Was anything you said the truth ? I got shot . I wanna explain . About john . About your brother . I don 't need an explanation . Sarah . What the hell 's that ? That 's where the warehouse is .

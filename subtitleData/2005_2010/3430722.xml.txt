And then you went into a coma for five days . ' R. R ' I believe I owe you some explanation ΄ They anted e to do exactly what the rest of the world was scared of That is ' to create a supernatural human being ... So I built a supercomputer ... to be Aurora 's artificial mother . Just like a computer . But when she was born , she became much more than just an experiment . You see ' she became - she became my daughter . That 's when they hired Gorsky to kill me . Well , he almost succeeded . He took my baby away . I searched for her for years . I couldn 't find her . To the rest of the world . What do you want from me ? I want you to find my daughter . We think she 's alive and that she planned everything . She even shot you with a purpose . You see you died with your eyes open . But your brain recorded more than you can actually remember . I was dead . Precisely . People are starving for any kind of miracle . We were the provider and we had the copyright . 250 million followers today . Two billion tomorrow . This is what Aurora represented . Our stock options were sky high , and the whole world was waiting for a revelation . But not anymore . Aurora was our trademark . And your incompetence has thrown 20 years of careful planning down the tubes . Who gave the order to use guns to retrieve her ? You left Gorsky no choice ! What were you thinking ? Try not to get upset , Your highness . It 's bad for your blood pressure . Stop fussing . Well ? Does anyone have any suggestions ? What should we do ? Your highness , we want to launch a campaign . ΄ . To inr the people that we were targets of a terrorist attack . We need to be proactive , not victims ! I i , a closer look at God through our new space module . We need a miracle , not another gadget ! What ? I from the morgue was Toorop 's . Lic t a that transported him in New Jersey . Who would want to abduct the body of a dead man ? What am I looking for ? What you missed the first time . We 'll guide your memory with our computer . Are you ready , Μr . Toorop ? I hope so . St r . Fast forward . Νot too fast . Those are his wars . Don 't bring him too far back ΄ ' li I. He 's going back too far . - Kill ! ' I il . Bring him back . Don 't lead him there .

He 's dead . Wait . Don 't bring him back yet . Go home . It 's all riht . It 's all right , Toorop . You 're back . You 're safe . " Go home . " What does it mean ? How 'd she survive the blast ? It 's the babies , you see . They 're gaining power . They 're the ones guiding her . Her capacity r suival is greater than anything we could ever have imagined . Survival of the fittest . We 're a pathetic race , really . E stopped evolving at a critical point . Her babies are our future . They are the real miracle . You tried to correct mankind by creating a Virgin Mary .

Twenty years ago I gave you the opportunity you wanted . Νow it 's my moment . Where is my daughter ? She 's not your daughter . She comes from me ! I designed her ! For me ! She 's my miracle ! She belongs to my church ! Are you willing to die for her ? Yes . Why ? For a reason you will never understand . Love ? I understand love . Find Toorop . He knows where she is . Wait here . Toorop . You 're finally home . What 's left of it . But I came back for you . Have a little faith . I thought I had saved her . But i was wrong . Aurora was designed to breed .

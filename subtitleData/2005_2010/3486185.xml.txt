 Previously on Terminator ... { \ Make sure you } Get to the safe house before night . The safe house in the desert ? - The desert 's that way . - We 're taking a detour . Who lives here ? - John Henry was infiltrated . - Someone out there wants to kill him . I don 't know which one is his . Doesn 't matter . Grass , trees ... Could be worse . Could . It 's been 25 years . Desert . You said meet us in the desert . I did . Funny thing about the desert , you don 't find many lighthouses there . We stopped to see Charley . So you did . - Charley 's dead . - So I heard . - From who ? - John . - He called you too . - Good thing . Might not have found you . My brother buried out there , I thought ... That counted for something between us . Well , John counts for more . And you keep too many secrets for my taste . Sorry about Charley . Well , everybody dies for me , right ? I found this on the body at the lighthouse . Who is it ? I don 't know , but I 've seen her . - Where ? - Dr. Sherman 's office . - The shrink from the list ? - I think she was a patient there . Probably the one we were looking for . { \ These people , } They tried to kill us , they have a picture of this girl . It means something . We all know where we 're going , so let 's just go . All right , everyone . Go to your Learn-a-word program . I 'm gonna give you ten new words . You 'll put them in the search box . And then ... Maybe you 'd like to tell the class what 's so funny ? Nothing . - That doesn 't look like Learn-a-word . - I 'm just chatting . With who ? My friend . Who 's your friend ? She said his name was John Henry . I 'm sure it 's made up . These types of predators often use pseudonyms . I see . Grown man contacting a girl this age ... I probably don 't have to tell you { \ , Ms. Weaver , } { \ that } there 're some troubled people out there . Yes , there are . And some of them look perfectly normal . Yes , they do . { \ Well , } I hate to think what can happen if he finds out where she lives . I appreciate you bringing this to my attention . I 'll talk to her . Why were you talking to John Henry during class ? I was teaching him the words to a song . - What song ? - The one daddy used to sing . I want John Henry to sing it with me . - Maybe I could sing it with you . - You 're not a boy , and you can 't sing . Fine . We won 't sing . But what you do have to do is pay attention to the teacher . She said bad things about John Henry . What did she say ? She said if you talk to somebody on the computer , they could come to your house and hurt you . John Henry would never hurt you . But there 're some people who wouldn 't understand him . And people are afraid of things they don 't understand . If they knew him , they 'd like him . That may be , but for now , { \ I } don 't { \ want you to } talk to anyone about him . - Is that clear ? - Okay ... I won 't . I 'll see you tonight . What are you looking at ? Myself . Why ? Do you have a brother , Mr. Ellison ? Yes ... In Atlanta . - Does he look like you ? - People seem to think so . Do you think my brother looks like me ? John Henry , wherever your brother might be , he 's a ... computer . He doesn 't look like anyone . He certainly doesn 't have your face . I know that , Mr. Ellison . I simply meant , I wonder how similar his data is to my data . I wonder if we share the same thoughts . I have no idea , but ... I imagine you 're unique . Yes , I am unique . But we may still reach many of the same conclusions , - given similar data sets . - You may think alike . I 'd like to know if we do . The human brain is an amazing computer . Its raw clock speed is 20 billion calculations per second . Its storage is functionally infinite . But it 's flawed . How is that ? There 's nowhere to download it when you die . Not exactly , no . Your Bible solves this problem by introducing the concept of heaven . Billions of souls with no bodies . Yet all this is required simply to process the unique entity you call John Henry . It 's possible heaven has a hardware problem . It 's not that simple . I need to know what my brother is thinking , Mr. Ellison . I need to know what he plans to do . I don 't wanna die again . { \ Do you think you can } Will you be a little angel while I do 25 min of turbo body crunches ? I still have math . I 'm adding . Great . - I can 't talk right now . - Why not ? I 'm doing my homework . But I have an idea . You can come over and do math with me . I have to go . I can 't hold the phone and write my numbers . Use the headset . You can talk and work simultaneously . Si ... Simul ... Simultaneously . It means to occur at the same time . Coterminous . What does " coterminous " mean ? Hi . Savannah , listen to my voice . I 'm scared . Do as I say , and you will not be harmed . But you 'll have to finish your homework later . Hello , Mrs. Weaver ? This is RNE Security . We detected an unauthorized entrance at your front gate . Do you require assistance ? Mrs. Weaver ? We 're sending a unit to your home . - Now come out of there . - I don 't want to . Don 't worry . I can tell you where to go . Who 's that man ? - The water delivery man . - Where is Debbie ? Debbie 's in the foyer . We 're not going that way . Go to the garage . Where do I go now ? Episode 2.21 v 1.00 Subtitles : Projet-SG No , it 's okay . Come on ! Come here . It 's okay . Come on . Keep moving ! Keep moving . Detective Crayton . LAPD . James Ellison , head of security . - { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I know who you are , Mr. Ellison . - What happened ? There was an attack on the residence about an hour ago . Alarm went off , security arrived , found the nanny dead . It was a pretty ugly firefight . Four security guards killed , plus one of the gunmen . - Daughter missing . - Any ID on the gunman ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } No ID . We 're waiting for ballistics , coroner 's report . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - Anyone call with demands ? - There 's an amber alert out . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } We 've set up a command post in the lobby here . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Officers posted throughout the building . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I 'm putting 24-hour protection on Ms. Weaver . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } How are you holding up ? { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } The detective wants to speak with Savannah 's friends . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I made a list . I 'm concerned I may have left someone off . If you can think of anyone else Savannah spends time with ... { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I 'll take a look . Excuse me . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } When I said I knew who you were , { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } I didn 't mean anything bad by that . { \ pos ( 192,190 ) } You know , thing are rough when " I know you " { \ pos ( 192,190 ) } can be taken as an insult . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Anyway , no offense . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } None taken . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } So how do you like the private sector ? { \ pos ( 192,180 ) } - I get a better car . - Nice . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Anything you can tell me ... About Weaver ? { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Not much to tell . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Husband died a couple years ago . She didn 't talk about that much ? { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } She doesn 't talk about much much . What 's her relationship with her daughter like ? They seem close . { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Have any enemies ? { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Not that I know of . I hate these cases . We 'll find her . Why did you stop looking for Sarah Connor ? { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } Well , she ... She died eight years ago . No , that 's not true . So you accept she 's alive ? - Sarah Connor was at the house ? - Alive . Obviously , yes . Did she take Savannah ? So it doesn 't surprise you she 's alive . No , it doesn 't surprise me . You lied about what you know . Did she take Savannah ? I tried to help but could not . Did Sarah Connor kill those guards ? - No . - Then who was she shooting at ? Him . We should tell Ms. Weaver . I don 't think we should tell anyone . You 're asking me to keep a secret . You tell me it 's wrong to lie , yet you keep doing it . I know what I said , John Henry . But in this case , a lie might save someone . How ? Our best chance to get Savannah back is for me to handle this . Quietly . You understand ? Is Sarah Connor going to hurt Savannah ? Would she harm me ? - Why do you ask that ? - She blew up Cyberdyne . She killed Miles Dyson . - His work is in my code . - Right now , the most important thing is to find Savannah . Who is she ? She 's ... like me , isn 't she ? If I keep your secret , will you bring Savannah back ? I 'll do everything in my power . So will I. Sarah Connor . This is James Ellison . How 'd you get this number ? A friend found it for me . Do you have her ? Just tell me if she 's safe . I need her back . Weaver 's house is wired . I 've seen the surveillance tapes . Right now , I 'm the only one that has . Let 's keep it that way . I can 't , not yet . It 's a long story . Tell it to me . Downtown , 3rd Street tunnel . One hour . - What are you doing here ? - Taking you to Sarah Connor . The plan was to meet at the tunnel . The plan changed . You 'll take a left . - I 'm gonna need your gun . - I don 't carry one anymore . You lied to me once before . I should have killed you then . Drive ! Where 's Savannah ? - What 's your deal with Zeiracorp ? - I work there . Why take the girl at the Weaver house ? - To protect her . - From who ? One of them . A machine was there at the house . What would they want with a six-year-old girl ? Who knows with these things ? - They may want her mother . - Why ? The girl was seeing Dr. Boyd Sherman . He worked at Zeiracorp . Died at Zeiracorp . That was an accident . The girl and her mother are in danger . You are in danger . Get me the girl back . I 'll handle it . Listen to me . Derek 's dead . Charley 's dead . Eight years ago , you would have thought I was crazy . Thrown me back in Pescadero . But you 've seen them . You know it 's true . They 're very good at what they do , and they 're not going to stop . Now , let me talk to Weaver . - Let me have Savannah . - She 's not safe with you . I 'm gonna have a hard time explaining that . Then let me explain it ... to her . - I told you to stay out of this . - I tried . Everywhere I turn , there you are . The security footage from the house ... I need to see it . I can 't access it right now . - Why not ? - The files were corrupted . A faulty sector on one of the drives . I 'm working to repair it . Savannah 's safe . You didn 't bring her back . Not yet . I 'm working on it . We need to talk . You remember me , right ? The squirrel runs around the tree . Dives in the hole , scurries up the other side . That 's right . - You taught me how to tie my shoes . - I did . At Dr. Sherman 's . He died . I know . I liked him . Me too . He was my friend . That man that got hurt at my house , was he your friend ? Yeah , he was . I 'm sorry . Me too . It 's all my fault . That is not true . The teacher told me ... Mommy told me too ... not to talk to John Henry . That if I did , bad people will come to our house and hurt us . Who 's John Henry ? He 's my friend ... at my mommy 's work . What does he do there ? He lives in the basement . He lives there ? My mommy says people won 't understand . Well , I understand . I had an imaginary friend too when I was your age . He 's real . He talks . I 'm teaching him how to sing . Why does he live in the basement then ? He can 't leave . There 's a cord in the back of his head . A cord ? In the back of his head . Do other people talk to John Henry ? Mr. Ellison . He works for my mommy . He teaches John Henry stuff . What kind of stuff ? Sarah Connor 's alive ? She wants to meet you . - She took my daughter . - To protect her . From a machine . It might be after you . - How do you know ? - I saw the security tapes . You did ? - John Henry , I suppose . - I asked John Henry to hide them . - From me ? - From everyone . Including you . - I can 't say that pleases me . - I think you should do what she asks . - You should meet her . - I 'm staying here . - Why ? - Someone needs to protect John Henry . John Henry ? This is your daughter . There 's a machine looking for her . You need to protect her . - I 'm sorry . - You should be . What you need to understand , Mr. Ellison ... What I believe you 're beginning to understand ... is that when my behavior implies that I value John Henry 's survival more than that of my own daughter , it is not because I love John Henry more than Savannah . It 's because I believe Savannah 's survival may someday depend upon John Henry 's survival . And because I believe that your survival may someday depend upon John Henry 's survival . I 'll meet with Sarah Connor . Make it happen . Ballistics came in on the John doe . Funny thing : the bullet that killed him didn 't come from the security guards . Strange . Turns out he 's a fugitive . Ex-con . Escaped custody on a felony murder charge . That 's the other funny thing . It was your case . Andrew Goode murder . - You interrogated him ? - Yes , I did . Hours before he escaped ? That 's right . Guilty ? - I never had a chance to prove it . - Because he escaped . Only to turn up months later at the home of your employer . I know what you think . I know why you 're thinking it . I would think the same thing if I were in your shoes . I 'm not thinking anything yet , Mr. Ellison . I 'm just collecting information . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - How 's the girl ? - She 's fine . She was just telling me about her friend , John Henry . The man with the cord in his head in the basement of her mother 's work . Plugged into a big computer . And this is him . Oh , it gets better . She says that Mr. Ellison has been teaching it things . I destroyed that chip . You destroyed " a " chip . I don 't think it 's Cromartie . I think it 's something else . Something bigger . Something worse . - It 's Cyberdyne all over again . - Why do they need the body ? The technology can be reverse engineered and used as a platform . Yeah , I know all that . But they 're not using it for the parts . They 're playing with it . I should have killed him . - I 'm going to kill him . - You 're not going to kill him . - He can 't be trusted . - No one can be trusted . - But I only wanna kill him . - No one 's going to be killed . No one 's going to be killed . - Catherine Weaver has agreed to meet . - Great . When ? Where ? You give me the girl , the police go home . When it 's clear , I 'll bring you in . The girl can 't stay there . It 's not safe . That 's for her mother to decide . Done . We don 't kill just to kill . I never have . Looks vicious . They stay in hiding , mostly . And only attack when provoked . What does it eat ? Cuttlefish . Crustaceans . Other eels . Please don 't tap the glass . How long has Mr. Ellison worked for you ? A few months . You ever ask yourself why he didn 't stay with the FBI ? No , I don 't . Are you aware he was arrested ? Murder . He was cleared of those charges . Did the two of you argue lately ? Had any tension ? Any reason he might want to harm you and your family ? Detective ... Are you suggesting Mr. Ellison may be complicit in the disappearance of my daughter ? It wouldn 't be the first time we 've seen an employee try to blackmail their boss . It would be the first time I had . This thing ... It eats other eels , huh ? It 's interesting . { \ pos ( 192,190 ) } When you told me the security tapes were corrupted , { \ pos ( 192,190 ) } you were lying to me for Mr. Ellison . { \ pos ( 192,190 ) } And I 'm lying to him for you . What would happen if he knew ? Knew what ? That you aren 't Savannah 's mother ? That you aren 't anyone 's mother . Are you threatening me , John Henry ? I could tell Mr. Ellison . You could ... But that would be unfortunate . Mostly for Mr. Ellison . I find him useful , but not efficient . What if he fails ? Then we won 't see Savannah again . Mr. Ellison taught me that human life is sacred . Sacred ... That 's an interesting word . Comes from the Latin , sacrum . Much like another word : sacrifice . Sacrifice . Perhaps it 's necessary to sacrifice Savannah for the greater good . The greater good is keeping you safe . In the elevator , you told Mr. Ellison ... that Savannah 's survival depended upon my survival . Yes , I did . But you didn 't say ... that my survival depended upon hers . It doesn 't . There is a bible story of two brothers , Cain and Abel . God fathered Abel . Cain killed him . God cursed Cain and ordered him to wander the world alone . I 'm familiar with the story . Which brother am I ? I don 't know , John Henry . Perhaps you 're neither . Perhaps , in this story , you are God . I wanna tell you something . It was not my idea to ditch you and Derek . I thought we were gonna meet you { \ in the desert } . Mom took this detour off to Charley 's . I thought you knew . She had her reasons . She was pretty damn pissed at Derek about the whole Jesse thing . Who wasn 't ? I guess none of that matters now . You 'll miss him . There 's no use crying about it ... Is there ? I 'm sure future me would beat my ass if I did . Future you knows what it means to lose people you love . It happens to him too . Your mother ditched us because she was going to ditch you . She was going to leave you with Charley . - No , that 's insane . - She found a lump in her breast . The transmitter , I know . She thought it was cancer . She had a lump . It makes sense . She 's lost weight . What ? Get her up . We 've gotta go . Think he 'll come ? He 'll come . He could be deceiving us . He 's done it before . He wants the girl . He 'll be here . And what if he doesn 't come through ? With the meeting with Weaver . We 're going into Zeiracorp with or without him . When we 're done , it 'll be ashes . You alone ? Where 's Savannah ? Row " J " . I 'll be in touch about the meeting . Put your hands behind your head . Kneel on the ground . John , I swear I didn 't know . I 'll kill you ! Let go of me ! I 'll kill you .

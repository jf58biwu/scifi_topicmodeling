 Previously on Heroes : Of all of them , I never expected it would be you . Kaito ! This thing we can do , it only begins at reading minds . And then it becomes so much more . Isaac Mendez . Everything he 's painted comes true . They given you a gun ? Her name is Claire Bennet . Remember her father , Noah ? - We should kill him ? - We should be prepared . I have been working with Bennet to take down this company . Why are you telling me this now ? He found us . The man who abducted me . Gotta get out of here . Been trying to tell you . Guy in the glasses is my father . Not safe here . Pack your bags . We 're moving . - What are you wearing ? - My uniform . I have a pep rally today . Maybe I didn 't make myself clear . We 're leaving Costa Verde today . You made yourself plenty clear . I 'm not leaving . Go change out of that outfit or I will ... Or you 'll what ? Abduct me ? Experiment on me ? Erase my memory ? That 's what you did , isn 't it ? You inject them with some sort of ... Talking about things you don 't understand . Actually , I do understand . You abducted West . - What ? - When he was , like , 12 . When he saw you yesterday , I have never seen anyone so terrified . What are you talking about ? Dad does not abduct people . Dad is a bad guy , Lyle . He 's a liar . Don 't listen to a word he says . - Claire ! - Would you stop defending him ? That 's all you do . I mean , look at us ! Moving , lying , changing our names . All I want is for you to have a safe and normal life . This isn 't about me . This is all about you and the things you 've done . If you and your boyfriend hadn 't showboated ... Stop using that as an excuse . No matter what I do , this is never gonna end , is it , Dad ? We 'll always be running . Do not walk out of that door ! What are you gonna do ... tie me up ? If I have to . Enough ! Noah , put down the tape . Claire , go to school , say good-bye , come right home . We 're leaving tonight . I hate you . I do not take death threats idly . - So you think one of us sent these ? - Yes , for the pain we caused . The people we have killed . There is no end to our suffering . - Good morning . - Morning ! - How 'd you sleep ? - On my pillow . No nightmares , no Nightmare Man ? - No . - Good . - What were you looking at ? - That 's a puzzle . People in that photo fit together somehow . Some got hurt . I 'm trying to find the rest - so that no one else has to . - I can find them . No . No , you won 't . I made that mistake once . I 'm never gonna ask you again . Sit down . I want you to be a normal little girl . I 'm not normal . I can find people . All right , you wanna help ? Come here . If you wanna help , help me put the nightmare man behind us , so we can get back to normal . OK ? And just be a little girl . Go to school , have fun . And I 'll be ... an underpaid cop . - Deal ? - But why can 't we ? Just do it , OK ? For me ? OK , I 'll do it for you . Back to normal . Come back and finish yourcereal . - Welcome to Costa Verde . - How are we gonna do this ? Swiftly . We grab Claire , we take out her father . We get out . When you say " take out " , you mean kill ? It is a euphemism . Word choice aside , I never agreed to take out anybody . You were loyal to Bennet . I get that . You were going to take down the company . Made the right choice in telling me the truth . I 'm not choosing sides . This is about Claire 's blood curing Niki . I 'm just trying to do the right thing . What I like about you , your moral compass always faces true north . Which is why you 're going to get a new partner . One who can execute . One whose compass faces north-northwest . - I hope you 're using sunscreen . - Ugh . Overprotective , much ? Dr Suresh , I would like you to meet my daughter , Elle . Your daughter ? She 's the executioner ? What 's your super power ? Punching bag ? Been working on your sharp shooting ? Don 't want you to get too close to Bennet . Hey , Fight Club ... Check this out . What 's your deal ? I figured this was your flight path to school . You don 't have to pretend anymore . The jig is kinda up , spy girl . I 'm not pretending . And I 'm not a spy , I swear . I 'm just ... I 'm just a cheerleader . So this is all a big coincidence ? That your dad just happens to be the guy who abducted me ? - Then why didn 't you just tell me ? - I was selfish . You liked me . You were like me . And I thought that if I told you it would just mess everything up . And I guess it did . - My family 's leaving town . - When ? Tonight . But I 'm not going with them . I 'm staying here because of you . I wanna believe you . But I don 't . I need to go figure things out . I 've been on hold waiting for a special agent ... No , some of that interdepartmental cooperation I 've been hearing about on the news . Yes , I 'll hold . What are you doing ? I was on hold with the FBI . Want you to tell me why you 're on hold with the FBI . To get information on the Nakamura case . The Kaito Nakamura case is closed . Angela Petrelli confessed . She didn 't do it . There 's something bigger going on . These guys are involved in some kind of , organisation , like from the ' 70s . - Like a disco ? - No ... no . Like a research facility . I was there yesterday . All these guys ... Nakamura , Linderman , Arthur Petrelli , my dad and this Adam Monroe guy . - Your dad ? - Yeah . - Let it go . You got real work to do . - This is real work ! And it 's important . Lives could be at stake . Your job could be at stake if you keep this up . Now , I need you back on the planet Earth . You got me ? - No . - Excuse me , detective ? Give me 24 hours . Let me talk to Angela Petrelli again . Tell you what . You got 24 hours . Talk to Angela Petrelli again . - Then you 're done . - Thank you . Great idea . - Is this him ? - He looks a lot younger there . Well , apparently , he can fly . Did you really do what Claire said ? Abduct him when he was just a boy ? I thought we were doing good . Saving the world . I don 't know why I 'm not getting in the car with the kids and leaving you . Come here . I want to show you something . Remember that painting I showed you ? The death of Kaito Nakamura ? Hard to forget a story about a man who can paint the future . That was one of eight . I found the other seven yesterday . That 's Claire , isn 't it ? - Is that ... - Claire 's right . It 's all about me . And this man with the gun , is he gonna shoot you ? I 've considered it , but Suresh is one of the good guys . You think West has something to do with it ? Don 't know . West is the reason Claire won 't leave . I need to talk to him . It 's all falling apart . I really need you now . I 'm gonna take Lyle to school . Hello . Molly well enough to use her ability ? - Why ? - I need to track down a boy , and I don 't have time to run all over Costa Verde . His name is West Rosen . - You OK ? You sound ... - Can you do it or not ? Yes , of course . - Mohinder ... - Yeah ? Just ... Thank you . - That was Bennet . - Does he know we 're here ? No . He just wanted some information . A location of a boy . Maybe we can use this to our advantage . - How so ? - We feed him a false location . Isolate him . Get him away from Claire . We don 't have to kill him . Do you know what happens when you change your plans mid-stream ? - No . - Neither do I. - Because we don 't do it . - Let me put it this way . We do it my way , or I blow the whistle right now . - Tell Bennet everything . - Bennet is dangerous . You saw what he did to his mentor in the Ukraine . Don 't you think , if push came to shove , he 's do the same to you ? - No . I don 't . - He 's adorable . Can I keep him ? OK ... We do it the doctor 's way . I sought redemption by helping Hiro fulfil his destiny to save the world . How did you help your son ? I 'm leaving for Japan tonight . I suggest you disappear as well . - Where are you going ? - I can 't just wait around . He goes to school with Claire . And I know where that is . Remember me ? Then you know I don 't have super strength . I can 't hold on forever . - What do you want ? - Answers ! - We took you to study your abilities . - Don 't care about any of that ! Claire ! Is she working with you ? Or for you ? Did she ever care about me ? Claire never even mentioned you existed ! You hear me ? She lied to me ! So I 'm guessing you 're pretty important to her . You listen to me very carefully . I am taking Claire . We are leaving town . You are gonna convince her that 's the right thing to do . Hello . I spoke to Molly . She 's located West . He 's in Costa Verde . - Corner of Verbena and Palm . - Now ? - You sure ? - Molly 's ability has pinpoint accuracy . Can 't guarantee he 'll be there forever . You should get there quickly . OK . I 'll head right over . - What 's going on ? - Claire 's in danger . I need your help . Claire Butler , bring it on in ! Hey , we missed you this morning . - Is everything OK ? - Yeah , everything 's great . Good . Come here . This is Mr Bishop from the state board of education . He needs to talk to you about the Debbie incident . Please ... call me Bob . - Am I in trouble ? - No , no , no . Just wanna ask you questions . May we walk ? Yeah , sure . We take underage drinking very seriously . Of course . You haven 't seen any other incidents of drinking , hazing ? - No , sir , none . - You wouldn 't lie to me , would you ? No , sir . An incident like this can ruin a girl 's life . You wouldn 't wanna do that , would you , Miss Bennet ? What did you just call me ? - Have you killed many people ? - How is that any of your business ? I guess it 's not . Bennet . Let me talk to him first . Alone . - You sure ? - I am . He trusts me . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm sorry I lied to you . I only have a second . Listen to me . They forcing you to do this ? Do they have Molly ? Nobody is forcing me to do anything . I 'm here to ask you to give us Claire . - We need her blood . - You 've gone native . Are you kidding me ? She 'll be returned to you safe , unharmed . You have my word . No offence , Mohinder , but your word isn 't what it used to be . Claire is important to the work we 're doing . She can save lives . You sound like me ten years ago . This is what they do , they indoctrinate you . I couldn 't have been more clear when you agreed to go in . - They 're not who you think they are . - They are not getting Claire . I have to do what I think is right . Start driving . Please . Dad ! Mom ? ! Lyle ! - Ah ! Mom ! - Claire ? This guy showed up at my school . - He knew our real name . - What ? Dad was right . I messed up and they found us . - We gotta go . What is this ? - Go where ? Why your father 's been acting strangely . - Thinks that 's gonna happen . - Isaac Mendez was a very talented artist , and incredibly accurate . Good to see you again , Sandra . - You know him ? - Yeah . He was the regional sales manager of Primatech Paper . - So who 's your partner ? - Excuse me ? Company policy . One of them , one of us . Who 's yours ? Elle , huh ? - You know her ? - Oh , yeah . Hey , you . You lie to me , betray me . You come after my daughter . How did you think it was gonna end ? Mr Butler , what are you doing ? No one 's taking my little girl . Sandra ! Claire ! He took Claire . Your old boss , Bob . - What the hell is going on ? - It 's OK . - We 're gonna get her back . - How ? - I 've got collateral . - What do you mean ? Hi , Mrs Butler . It 's good to , uh ... see you again . Did you pack Mr Muggles ' doggy bath ? I need to speak to your father . What do you think , this is my first day ? Stings like a bitch , doesn 't it ? I know all about your ability , Elle . You don 't know anything about me . I was there . When your father first brought you in . You were a normal girl . Unicorns and rainbows . And then they started the testing . The human brain isn 't built to take that much electricity . - You poor girl . - My father would never let that happen . - Your father was leading the charge . - I don 't remember any of that . No memories , huh ? Kind of like someone took them away ? Why do you think I never let the company anywhere near Claire ? I didn 't want her to become you . Now , I need to talk to your father to arrange a trade . - Claire for you . - What if he doesn 't wanna make a deal ? You 'd be surprised what a father would do for his daughter . Elle , where are you ? You touch my daughter and I 'll kill yours . - And then I 'll kill you . - Noah ? We 'll be at the Imperial Beach parking lot in two hours . Well , looks like you and I are going to the beach . I 'll do whatever you want . Promise me you 'll leave my dad alone . Wish it were that easy . Unfortunately , he 's got my daughter . Let me talk to him . He 'll listen to me . He 's not big on the listening . And once he sets his mind , it 's stuck . Which is why we gave you to him . We thought he would be loyal to the end . Turns out we were right . It 's too bad , really . You 'd be an excellent addition to the team , Claire . You , your blood . You can help a lot of people . Good . Take my blood . Take as much as you want , but leave my dad alone . No one has to die . Thanks for your help , West . - Go on home to your family . - No way ! I 'm going with you . No , it 's too dangerous . Exactly . I 'm the quickest way to get Claire out . All right . Wait for me in the car , OK ? They say girls tend to find boys like their dads . - Because he can fly ? - No , her real dad . You . All he cares about is protecting her . If anything happens ... Nothin ' is gonna happen , except you bringing Claire back . Of all of them , I never expected it would be you . Hey ! Kaito ! Kaito ! Kaito ! If you visit me one more time , Detective Parkman , I 'll expect you to make an honest woman out of me . That is the plan , actually . Are you going to try to read my mind again ? I knew your father when he could do it . I 'm even less impressed with you . Those marks that you have , my father made you do that to yourself , didn 't he ? Did you know him when his mind reading became something more ? When pull became push , and then he realised he could put a thought into anyone 's head ? Don 't do this . You are gonna answer every question I have , truthfully . For once . Who really killed Kaito Nakamura ? - It was Adam . - Adam ? Monroe ? Son told me that you and your friends locked him up 30 years ago . - Why ? - He was dangerous . - How ? Like a bomb ? - No , worse . We thought he was just able to heal . - Cellular regeneration . - Like Claire , your granddaughter . What we didn 't know is that if your cells continually regenerate , after a while , you stop growing old . - What 's old ? - Four hundred years . - Know where Adam is ? - He wants revenge for locking him up . He 's not gonna rest until all of us are dead . You are , except for you , Bob , my dad and this woman in the photo . - Who is this woman ? - Please ... don 't do this . - I need you to tell me the truth . - The truth ... The truth is that our generation mortgaged our souls to protect yours . Show a little respect for that . Get over your daddy issues and leave us be ! That 's all I want . Believe me . But Adam is still out there , and this woman is on his list . Tell me the truth . Who is she ? All she wants is to be left alone . I made her a promise . If you take this secret from me , you 're not just like your father you are him . - What kind of car do you drive ? - Excuse me ? You can fly , but you 're still a teenager . - You do have a car , right ? - Yeah , it 's a piece of crap SUV . I drove a ' 52 Citroën when I was your age . Oh , those things are awesome . Now , once we get Claire , you fly her out immediately . No matter what else happens . You understand me ? Yes , sir . It doesn 't have to be this way , Noah . Dad , the painting ! - Ah ! - Claire ! - Ah ! - Elle ! No matter what I do , we 'll always be running . But if you die , Bob , the company dies with you . Please , don 't do this . Dad ! The last thing I really said to my dad was " I hate you " . You didn 't mean it . No , I did . I keep playing it over and over . How I 'll never get a chance to take it back . Holy ...

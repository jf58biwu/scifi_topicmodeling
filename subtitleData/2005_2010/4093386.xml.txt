 Man : Okay , let 's go . - ( gasps ) - Man : Move it . Come on , baby . Come on . - ( electricity crackles ) - Move move move ! On me ! On me ! Through the room . He 's on flank . Drop it . What are you waiting for ? Do it ! Get the fuck up ! Get the fuck up ! Computer : Ending simulation . - ( gasping ) - Computer : Extracting players . You just got your whole unit blown up . You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - You 're a fucking liability , trooper . I think she 's really hurt , man . She 's fine . Automatic cut-out- - any vitals go critical , the system brings her out . You know the score . You fuck up , you get basted . We weren 't warned about booby traps in the arena , Sergeant . Warned ? You 're not Special Forces . You 're special fucking needs ! Now outside . Playtime 's over . Actually , I 'm gonna need her for a while first , Sergeant . You okay , Jess ? Yes , sir . Outside in 10 . The rest of you- - good work . Now piss off and have yourselves a weekend . I 'm fine . - Hey , Tom , what was that all about ? - Go debrief the others , Vic . Look , I 'm sorry , but my job is not to give you an easy ride . - Dismount , cowboy . - ( laughs ) All right , so when you were in there , there were times when you realized it was a simulation , right ? For instance , before finishing off that guy , you hesitated when you thought it was real , - but then you realized- - - Shit ! Just don 't tell them , all right ? Tom : It 's no problem . My job is to make the sim for the brain . Taggert 's the one that 's supposed to make a mindless killer out of you . Thanks. ls that it ? Yes , ma 'am . That 's all . What 'd you go and do that for ? - What 's that , Victor ? - This- - it was a booby trap . Were you planning on bringing her ? Because I really don 't think it 's her scene , man . No no no , that 's not the point . The point is , you nearly blew her fucking hand off , mate . And it grew right back . - ( dialing ) - l did you a favor , man . I mean , tell me . How did you plan on getting out of seeing her , anyway ? Oh , we had no definite plan . ( chuckles ) lt 's Friday night , dude . She may be Special Forces , but she is a chick . She would 've had you by the balls . - Fuck off . - She 'll be fine , trust me . It 's you I 'm worried about. I mean , look at you . You 're falling apart . You can make it up to her tomorrow , but for now , let 's get this show on the road . Okay . All right , dude . Load up and I 'll make the call . And try to be inconspicuous . Man : Tom , Fort Bragg is not the same without you , bud . Hey man , listen up. I 'm gonna run some sims tonight , off-base remote link . So I 'm gonna need a support team and the system running . Man : You 've got it. ls this another one of your crazy-ass experiments ? Tom : No . No no no , man . Just some regular extreme gaming , dude . No for reals . But hey , I am gonna push this . So if the readings get a little crazy , don 't worry about it , all right ? And , uh ... don 't tell the chief , okay ? Cool. I owe you one , man . - Hey . - Hey . So listen , sorry l- - l , um- - l screwed up earlier this evening . - You know , not that we had plans exactly- - - No. lt 's okay . It 's just too bad . So are you going somewhere ? Hey , I forgot to ask you about your hand . Oh , right . Yeah. lt 's fine actually . - Gave me a bit of a shock , that 's all . - Yeah , I 'm sorry about that . It 's hardly your fault. I have two hands now . - See ? - ( laughs ) - So , what 'll you do then , tonight ? - l don 't know . No real plans . You know ? Bit of gaming with Benny . Iain 's got this really kind of cool setup at work . So we 're gonna check that out . Oh , God . Geeks ' night out . Yeah . Geeks ' night out . - Are you up to something ? - No . No . I mean- - you know , anyway I 've got to go . - Oh ! Steady . - All right . Okay . - Uh , well , you better run . - Yeah . - so should I call you later then ? - Yeah . Yeah , you can call me later . You might need me to come rescue you . - Yeah . - All right . Let 's go . She 's gonna call later . Subterfuge just ain 't your thing , is it , bud ? What did the guy mean by " crazy-ass experiments " ? Oh , the guy 's retarded . They all are . They can 't even begin to fathom what this shit can do . A prophet 's never recognized his own land , mate . Tom : Damn straight . You think I came here for the weather ? Vic : Tell me about it . Fuck 's sake ! Fuckers ! - ( laughing ) - Come on , that 's mean . Kind of thought so . Tom , Benny . Benny , Tom . - The American Vic , right ? - ( laughs ) No. I 'm the original , he 's the Australian rip-off . - Oh . - Oh , man . - That hurts . - Have you got it ? The question is , my friend , have you got it ? - You know what I 'm saying ? - Absolutely . Oh , yeah . ( laughing ) Hold on . People actually pay you to get their avatars up to higher gaming levels ? Are you kidding me ? You call that a job ? Well , what can I tell ya ? - Meet the master . - Oh , here we go . And you can 't fucking laugh . I 've just creamed your high score again . I 'm on fucking fire , boys . This game of yours- - it won 't know what the fuck has hit it . Here we go , guys . Die , you fuck ! An empty jail . Imagine being stuck in here on your own every night . ( laughs ) Hell of a security guard . How long do we have to sit here for , Vic ? I mean , can 't we just go anywhere and set this up ? - No . - Why this gloomy shithole ? Tom : " Gloomy shithole 's " the point , bud . It 's completely undisturbed and it 's all ours . Not to mention , he 's got CCTV which clearly is not working . About bloody fucking time . About time ! Thank you ! Benny : Jesus Christ . This place is being turned into a hotel ? Vic : Five stars . Hey ! - What took ya ? - Mr. Sullivan . Good to see you again . You ready for this ? So it 's up to me and Vic to lift everything , eh ? Hey . Welcome to the house of fun , boys . We 'll be the judge of that . Yeah . Cool space , man . This will be unreal . Hey , where 's that stuff at ? - What stuff ? - Come on , man . You know what I 'm talking about . That crazy shit you told me that night in the pub . - Where 's it at ? - Benny : What crazy stuff ? Vic : Keep up . - The place that really spooked you . - Oh , yeah . People laugh at me for that . They think I 'm fucking hallucinating . But if they went down there , they wouldn 't laugh . I 'm not laughing at you , man . Just tell me , down where ? Benny : Where do I dump this ? North wing , lower level , through the tunnel . That 's where it 's worse , you know ? Benny : Oi ! Security . You sly fuckers . Fuck . - So this game ... - Mate ? - Cheers . - ... is it as good as Vic says ? This game ... is no game , my friend . Benny : Very fancy . What kind of specs are we talking ? Unless you have a PhD in Al from mit , don 't even ask . I do have an MA in " fuck you . " Will that not do ? - All right , so ... - ( beeps ) ... we 'll go ahead and wire up this place ... - ( beeping , whirring ) - ... and one other wing . That one . All the way downstairs too . My lovely assistant here will show you what to do . Wow . These are not what we 've been using . - What are these sexy things ? - lt 's an upgrade . It 's for your greater comfort and pleasure . - Oh , very comfortable . - ( device beeping ) They 're not gonna put themselves out . Okay . Take the bag . Vic : Iain , you know what to do , mate . Bring the weed and let 's get the fuck out of here . So , Vicky , if Yankee Doodle Dandy says to suck his cock , do you say , " How hard ? " Vic : Oh , Benny boy , for the purposes of tonight , so do you . Hold on , why are we going this way ? Because , my very stoned friend- - - Tom said so . - Yeah , but- - So , what do these gizmos do then ? - ( whirring ) - lt 's how the system maps the location . See , these babies will monitor just about anything- - geography , temperature ... lt 's looking good . Computer : Warning : raising emersion- - ... monitor movement , temperature , ionic charge every fucking molecule . This way . - Question . - ( gasps ) What were you up to at the sim building ? If you have a question , you can fucking well wait outside . You 're not a woman here , you 're a soldier just like all the rest . Isn 't that how you want it ? Get the fuck out of my way . - ( locker door rattling ) - Looking for lover boy , were ya ? You think I don 't know you 've been fucking your way through the course ? Bad news . The geeks can 't get you through . They 're not proper army . I 'm the real fucking army ! Basic training , trooper- - never drop your guard ... unless you want me to treat you different- - more like a woman . 'Cause I can do that . Put it away or wave it goodbye . Yeah . You think I can 't take that off you ? ( grunts ) Don 't you blink , trooper . You blink and it 's mine . And you . You 'll blink . Fuck ! Aw , fuck ! Wanker ! What kind of fucked up prison is this , lain ? Yeah , it 's not a regular prison , mate . Well , I mean it was until it closed down 20 years ago . Then the military took it over after 9 / 11 . When I was in the service it was supposed to be out of use , but we all knew different . - Benny : And ? - lain : Mate . Benny : Come on , lain . Spill the beans . - What the fuck happened here ? - Whoa . You know our boys were working with the Americans- - - Whoa . - - -picking up suspects overseas . And if they wanted to interrogate them without worrying about the Geneva Convention and stuff , - well , this is where they took them . - Bollocks . - What ? - You mean rendition ? - Yeah . - There was none of that shit here . What the fuck do you know ? All right , then wise up now . Now they export it . - That 's why they let this place go . - Of course they did . I 'm telling ya ! I was stationed at your base . - What , my base ? - Yeah . They used guys from there as guards here . - Uh-huh . - Mates of mine- - they told me stuff . Stuff ? What kind of stuff ? Torture . Unmarked graves . Dark shit . Whoa whoa whoa . These prisoners , they all went to Guantanamo , didn 't they ? Not all of them . Some people came in and never came out . No shit ? Iain : That leads to the interrogation cell . I don 't go down there . Bro , seriously , no one in the security company goes down there . That 's where it 's cold . Cold ? Yeah , well , I mean a kind of cold . It 's like death . How the hell were you ever in the army ? What do you know about fear ? Vic : Come on , lain. I 'll look after you , mate . Vic : Come on . - ( phone ringing ) - Jesus . - Jess : Vic , where are you ? - Hey , babe . Kind of weird , hmm ? Vic 's voice : ... leave me a message - and I 'll ring you back . - ( beeps ) Hey listen , Vic , it 's me . Um- - l know what you 're up to . And to be honest , I really don 't feel like hanging around here right now , so ... give me a call . All right . Fuck . - ( door clacks ) - Oh , you asshole . Fucking hell . What is that stench ? When did you say this place was last used ? We 're in . - Woman : Good evening . - Yes , hello . Do you have a Mr. Iain Sullivan working for you ? Woman : Mr. Sullivan- - yes , we do . Right , well , his mobile 's off , so do you think you could tell me where to find him ? Woman : I 'm not supposed to release that- - So , Major Tom , what are we waiting for ? Monitor signals need a boost- high as you can . - Gotcha . Aren 't you afraid of heights , soldier ? Iain : So do you guys do this often , then ? You know , knick the kit from the base ? yeah , sure . A bunch of us at Bragg devised a scoring system for the shoot-em-ups . We got ourselves a little league going . Thought it might be cool to have some international competition . And well , Vicky says you boys know what you 're doing . - Yeah . - Well ... maybe we 'll teach you a thing or three . - ( laughs ) - Yeah , or seven . Wow . You boys have got a high opinion of yourselves now , don 't ya ? Joking aside , as an American , at immigration , when they say " occupation , " do you have to say " No , just here on holiday " ? You 're a funny guy . Let 's see how much you laugh when you 're inside the belly of the beast . - Whatever . - Guys ! - We 're good to go . - ( beeping ) Hello . Private , I need the keys to the sim building . Right , Sergeant . - All right . - You 're fucking kidding . Okay . All right , none of that . Come on . - Ready ? - Spoil sport . how does this miracle machine work then ? Well , we- - we manipulate the temporal lobe . It stops the brain from being able to tell reality from fantasy . What the- - temporal- - No , is it ... - it 's safe , yeah ? - ( laughing ) Relax , Tom 's done it 100 times . Right , Tom ? Simple appliance of science . Don 't worry . I 've only ever lobotomized a couple of guys . You 'll be just fine . See , basically , you boys- - you 're going to be in a waking dream state . - Right ? - You know how sometimes you know - that you 're dreaming ? - Yeah . Yeah , well , you might feel that at first , but then we take the breakers off , the dream becomes reality . - Here we go . - ( computer beeping ) You guys not coming in then ? We just gotta get things running smoothly . - We 'll see you girls in there in a bit . - Right . - Aw , cool . - This is gonna be great . All right , mate . How fucking crazy is this ? It looks like you . Guys , listen up . I can feel that ! You 're moving into a different reality . Your brains need time to interface with the software . This is fucked . Guys- - Tom : Pretty soon you won 't be able to hear me . - You 'll be completely online . - Stop it , right ? Something is up with Benny . Unfamiliar scenario . He 'll be fine . You are soldiers in enemy territory . Look around . Fight and stay alive . - Full combat ? - The works , baby . ( laughs ) Holy mind fuck . Yeah ! It 's been too fucking long , right ? Check your weapon . Okay . Safety off . Go for it . ( laughing ) Yes . Right , let 's fucking go for this . Come on . Computer : Uploading . - That 's so beautiful . - Concentrate , soldier ! Focus . They 're above us . Get behind me ! Go go ! How do you score ? Tom : Let 's regenerate a few . Go go go ! Benny : They 're coming from everywhere ! Fuck ! Go down the fucking stairs ! It 's getting a little extreme there , don 't you think ? It 's a fucking program . The combatants are programmed to miss . Go go go go ! Fall back ! Come on ! Go go go go ! What the fuck ? Get in here ! - lain ! - Piece of shit ! Benny : Iain , you all right ? - Bitch ! - You 're not so clever now ! Iain . Fuck ! - Vic : Shit , man- - what- - - ( keys tapping ) What the fuck is that ? That looked like a woman . - l 've got bigger problems to deal with . - Computer : Access denied . The automatic cut-out just ... cut out . - Computer : Access denied . - ( beeping ) Oh , shit. lain 's in trouble . - Where are you going ? - l 'm pulling the plug , man . What are you , crazy ? There 's a million different ways that could mess him up . If nothing else , you could turn him into a vegetable . But leaving him in there might fucking kill him . Okay , man ? It 's my call . First you close the program . - Well then , close the fucking program ! - l 'm trying ! - ( gunfire ) - lain ? Fuck . - Okay , we didn 't upload that . - ( snarling ) Tom : We 've got to get them out now . Oh , fuck . Oh , God . Come on . For fuck 's sake , lain , get up . Come on , get fucking up ! You all right ? Yeah ? What doesn 't kill ya ... Ready , yeah ? Holy fuck . Look like we fucking blew them away . No , man . That wasn 't you . No . Bullets may have done that ... but not that . Benny : I definitely did that , mate . This has got to be the most coolest thing yet . That 's for sure , eh ? Escape , you stupid- - Fuck ! Escape ! Iain : Shut up ! Just shut up ! - ( grunts ) - Computer : Ending simulation . - Tom : Got ' em . - Computer : Extracting players . Hey . You okay ? Oh-ho , my fucking God ! - Yeah , you like that , huh ? - Liked it ? ! It was fucking horrible ! Give me more ! ( laughs ) Hey , you all right ? Yeah , fucking fine . Man on loudspeakers : Sergeant Taggert , this is Fort Bragg Control . How can we help you ? Equipment 's gone missing from my base . It may be your base , but it 's our equipment . This is a security matter . Man : And your security status does not permit you to be in this facility on your own . Please leave immediately , Sergeant . That is some intense shit . Vic : What did I tell you , Benny boy ? Huh ? I mean , that could really fuck you up . Guys , listen- - Tommy , how did we do , anyway ? What 's the score ? Tommy boy ? The score ? - No score . - No score ? Yeah , the system , it didn 't collate it . We had to extract you early . We had a technical glitch . - He 's checking it out . - Fuck ! I fucking creamed them ! - ( chuckles ) - No , that wasn 't you . It certainly wasn 't fucking you , soldier . You see this guy ? He froze on me . Wouldn 't want him beside you in a real fight . - Shut the fuck up . - ( phone ringing ) - ( beeping ) - Computer : Scan complete . Sensor malfunctioning . Man : Hey , Tom , we 're getting some crazy readings . - What 's up ? - Yeah , it 's no big deal . It 's just a couple of the sensors blew . I 'm gonna go change ' em now . I 'm coming right back . No touching . Right , guys . Something really fucked up happened in there . Here we go . - Acid flashback . - No . This was not in my head . Well ... it was in my head , but- - ( snickers ) Iain , mate , you fried your brains . You really fucking deep-fried ' em . You gotta relax , lain . It 's all part of the game- - total immersion . I really don 't think this was part of any game . The game worked , man . You played the game . So , um , this precious system of yours- - Can it read any CD-ROM ? Yeah , it sure can . The program just acts as a catalyst for the brain . How about , say , this one ? No no no no , Benny boy . No . The system 's not all clear yet. lt 's too damn risky . Oh , how risky can it be ? Naked women . Oh fuck , no . Hey , whoa- - no . Don 't touch that . Which is it- - you don 't know how or you 're not allowed ? ( whispers ) Howdy . Now it 's best to stay in the room . The rest is not all mapped out yet , okay ? Yeah . All right . Man , this is a bad idea . Stop being such a fucking Cassandra . - A what ? - Ho-ho ! He 's ignorant too . Cassandra , she was the Trojan princess . She- - well , she had the gift of prophecy but no one believed her . Right . So what you 're saying is that no one believed her , but actually she was right . Right . That- - that was a bad example . That 's not what I meant . What I meant was- - What he 's saying is a faint heart never fucks a pig , yeah ? - True . - Yeah . - Let 's rock . - Hmm ? I hope the ladies like a guy in uniform . We 'll make it ideal . And they don 't give it a shit because they 'll even like you . Now you 're going into a new place . Your mission- - well , it 's to fuck anything that moves , right , mate ? - ( laughs ) - Can you actually , like , fuck ? - Fuckers . - ( laughs ) Fuck . Evening , darling . Got something for a weary soldier , have ya ? Cool . Yes . Ha ha . Can you give her a bit more , I don 't know , character ? What , you mean like " character " ? Yeah , like , you know ... dominatrix . I can 't do that . Iain : He likes ' em beefy . That 's what I call " WM-Double-D . " Perfect just got better . Come here . Woman : Hey , baby . - ( glass shatters ) - Oh fuck . Yes . ( laughs ) - Tom . - Jess . What are you doing here ? Funny that. I was about to ask you the same thing . Oh , boys will be boys . When did you plan this ? Totally last minute . You 're full of shit . Don 't tell anyone , okay ? - Hold that thought . - Oh , I will . - Man : Tom . - Hey , man . Yeah , I just fixed it . - Man : Copy that. lt 's running right now . - No no , that 's not possible . Man : I 'm getting some strange pictures here , Tom . Those motherfuckers ! Unbelievable . Oh , yes . What 's this ? Brought another friend , did ya ? - On you go , cowboy . - Hey , asshole ! Stop the fucking program ! Would you relax ? It 's just a bit of fun , No fucking idea- - Big drama queen . Don 't fuck with my game , dude . - ( clears throat ) - Jess ! You are in so much trouble . Benny : Why don 't you come over and join us here , love ? The more the merrier . Why don 't you let me work on this one a couple of minutes , yeah ? - You fucking idiots ! - Relax . It 's just a bit of fun . Look at him . You stood me up for this ? Uh , technically we didn 't have a date . Charming . Relax , it 's not like I 'm with another woman . Right , so ... what would you call this then ? Okay , it was Benny 's idea . It was his idea . Look at him . - ( slams CD ) - Come on ! It was Benny 's idea , babe ! That is ... some look , babe . A little shy , are ya ? Not too shy for a bit of bondage though . That 's , uh- - just a little tight , babe . - Seriously ? - ( groans ) Guys . Guys ! Look . l- - l don 't think this woman is ideal . No need to stop entirely . See ? What I tell you ? Look . Huh ? He 's loving it . Look at him . - Jesus Christ . - Fuck me . - Shit . - What the fuck happened there ? Benny ? Someone get him out . - Computer : System locked . - Tom : It won 't close . Vic : Shit ! Shit . - Jess : Jesus . - Do something . - Jess : His neck ! - Tom : I 'm on it . - What just happened ? - l just replaced some of the sensors , but these idiots started the program before it came online again . Just hold on , okay ? - That should do it . - ( beeping ) I thought that there was no way that it could cause actually , physical damage . Yeah , I said that this is out of control . Look- - the cut-out fucked up . It could just be a muscle spasm , okay ? But he 's alive . We can get him out . We just have to find him , that 's all . - So , where is he ? - The arena 's shifting . - Tom ! - That 's unexpected . - Unexpected ? - Appliance of science . We apply , it replies . Fuck . What 's it saying now ? Fuck . Oh , fuck ! Hey , Tom ! Stop staring at it , mate , and do something . Come on , please . Shit . I 'm sorry , Benny . Why can 't we just unplug him ? To unplug him , we 'd have to close the program . And to close the program , we 'd have to extract the players . And to extract the players , we gotta know where they are . - How can this happen ? - What part of it , Jess ? The program not closing ? The disappearances ? Injuries ? It 's got in there , that 's how . It 's fucking in there . - What is ? - He 's got some mentalist notion - there 's a haunted corridor . - Oh , for- - There 's something down there . Vic , you felt that weird shit . And I told him we shouldn 't be fucking around down there . If you don 't believe me , fucking ask him . Why 'd you pick that wing , Tom ? If you would all just calm down- - As a matter of fact , why did you even insist we come here in the first place ? We need to focus on Benny . No , we need to know what 's going on , Tom ! Yeah . Tom , enough . All right , no bullshit , no cryptic comments . Just tell us what the fuck is going on . We may have uploaded an anomaly . What kind of anomaly ? He means a ghost . Did I not just say that ? I mean an unidentified source of energy - that has corrupted the system . - You uploaded it how , Tom ? Look , the vital thing right now is to get Benny out , wouldn 't you say ? We need to find him . So how do we find him ? Somebody has to go in . No . - Quickly . - All right . I put him in there. I 'll go and get him . Jess : Vic , there 's a hostile in there . You 've got hardly any combat experience . I 'll go with you . You 're better off to bring somebody who knows the place well too . It 's kind of ... changeable . You 're going in . Okay , Tom . Can we find him ? - ( beeping ) - To find him , we have to find her . Clearly we 're not dealing with an ordinary sim combatant . - How do we fight her ? - Well , you 're going to need a special weapon and I 've got just the thing . - Vic : An immobilizer . - Tom : lmmobilize , capture , drag- - bingo . You seem mighty well-prepared for this anomaly . What can I say ? I was a Boy Scout . Authorization is Taggert 750-X-02 . I 'm running a training sim here . I need you to triangulate a mobile signal . I 'm taking you in fast , guys . This is a search and rescue mission . Find the hostage , capture the hostile . Test your weapons . Good luck . Yeah . Beautiful . Iain , what 's the matter ? Arm yourself . Let 's go . Right . This way . Last man down . Go right . Closed down all this years ago . Running silent- - stick to giving directions . Right . Take the stairs in front of you . What stairs ? The fucking stairs in front of you . Iain , what stairs ? This is no time to piss about . The fucking- - lain , just ' cause you don 't want to go down there , mate- come on , hurry up . - No- - right- - look . I 've walked this beat 100 times- - a fucking 1,000 times . This is where the fucking stairs are . - He 's fucking right . - What are you waiting for ? All right. I 'm going to check down this way . You check the other cells . Come on . Vic ! Come here ! - Jess ! - Where the fuck has she gone ? ! Shit ! Fuck . She 's right behind you . Turn around . Guys ? Vic ? Jess ! Benny ! Shit . Jess ! Jess ! Mate , I don 't think you should be fucking shouting . Shut up . Benny ! Jess ! Jess : Oh my God . - Benny . - Jess . No , go . Go - She 's here . She 's here . - lt 's okay . She 's not here. I 've got you . ( grunts ) lt 's okay , Benny. lt 's all right . That 's it . Down you go . Oh , shit . - ( groaning ) - All right , Benny . You just hang tight . Help is coming . - Did I get the top score ? - What ? - Did I win ? - Benny , listen to me . You 're hurt . Just fucking beautiful . Just- - don 't try to speak , all right ? Hell of a thing- - world in a microchip . Looks ... almost ... real . Benny . - ( phone beeps ) - Man : Tom ? Did someone just die ? Benny . Shit . Fuck . There 's a good girl . Go ! Go ! ( screams ) - Man : Tom ? - Just bear with me , dude . I got a plan . - ( beeping ) - Shit ! Not again ! Fuck . Come on . What kind of a fucking game do you call this ? Listen to me , Taggert . You just cut the signal boost . Now they 're trapped inside until I reconnect . They 're already in serious danger . You just made it worse . No no , don 't touch him . Don 't ! He 's past caring . I knew you couldn 't handle combat , girlie ! You can 't even handle a fucking game . - ( grunting ) - No , she 's still in the system ! - Jess ! - She 's here ! She 's here ! Where is she ? Jess , stop . You 're out of the sim , Jess . - The sim , Jess- - - Fuck . Tom , there was a woman . - She killed Benny . - What was she like ? What was she like ? She- - she was evil . I know this sounds crazy , but ... she got inside my- - my head . It was like I had her memories . How could that happen ? You interfaced with it . Oh my God . That 's- - that 's everything- - Wait . He was there . - This is crazy . - Taggert ? - Where ? - He attacked me. I mean , fuck- - l mean , he attacked her. l- - Christ , that 's what she wants- - revenge . She 's going to kill- - why are they not out ? Tom , why are they not out of the sim ? You weren 't as fully immersed as they are , but ... if we don 't get them out right away , they may never come back . Here . Signal- - as high as you can . Iain : Where 'd the lights go , man ? It 's the extraction team . They cut the power . They have a tendency to do that . No . There 's no team , man . It 's just us . We 're left here , Vic . Oi , there 's something there . There 's nothing there , okay , lain ? Please , hold it together for me , okay , man ? - ( beeps ) - Okay . Come on , come on . Guys , hang in there . Cavalry 's coming . - Can you see them ? - lt 's rebuilding . Well , the whole fucking world has disappeared , man . Shut up . - You hear that ? - ( lights buzzing ) You hear that ? Fuck . Listen . Listen to that , mate . Listen to that . Hello ? Jess ! Benny ! Anyone ? No , mate . Don 't think about it . What 's that , lain ? Iain ? Iain ! - ( Iain screams ) - Shit , man ! Fuck ! Fuck ! You did this intentionally . Yeah . - l had this theory- - - What the fuck ! Are you saying that Iain was right ? What have you done ? Jesus Christ . Who is she ? A life form , a spirit , a ghost , call it what you- - l 'm sorry . Who was she ? Beats me . But she knew Taggert , so she can 't be that long gone . - Wait , I have an idea . Dude . - Man : What 's going on , man ? I need you to check some files for me . - ( computer beeping ) - Come on . Okay , complete . Get them out . It may be complete , but nothing is where it should be and I still can 't see them . - ( alarm beeping ) - Look at this crazy shit . She 's doing this . I can 't find anything anymore . I know where they are . Put me back in . - Put me in , quick . - Jess , once you find her , just get her in the beam and I 'll take care of the rest . Tom , get this- - if I find her , I 'm going to tie her chain around her fucking neck and I 'm going to rip her evil head off . Oh , shit . Fuck . Jess ! Jess ! Jess ! Vic ? Shit ! - ( woman moaning ) - Shit ! - ( beeps ) - Man : Tom , we got one possibility . - Talk to me . - Man : Just known as Prisoner K- - cyber-terrorist .

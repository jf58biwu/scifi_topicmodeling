 Previously on Heroes ... This is goodbye . I love you , Dad . I love you , Claire Bear . I care about the world . I just want to heal it . What could you possibly know about healing ? A few things . The company has developed a new tracking system that doesn 't rely on isotopes and satellites . It just finds you wherever you are . We go to New York , we wipe out the Walker System . There 's someone you need to meet . Molly Walker . I hear you have an amazing ability . They ask me where people are , and I find them . Molly is the only one who can stop Sylar . I must stop you . Then do it . Do it ! Kill me ! You can 't . Now I 'm gonna have to kill you . Hiro ! Your destiny , Nathan , is to set the course of history after this unspeakable act has occurred . Can you be the one we need ? That 's my boy . I explode . I wipe out this whole city . You , Nathan , everyone . You explode ? Like a nuclear bomb . But if I lose it , you 're the only one who can get close enough to stop me . Me , Ted . It doesn 't really matter . But you have to do this . I just miss my family . I hope I can make them proud . Dad ! Claire ! Claire ! What 's he doing ? He 's absorbing your ability . He 's gotta make it stop . Claire , you know what you have to do . Do it . Wait ! I 'm okay . Jittetsu Arms . Hello ? Yes . Do you fix ancient samurai swords ? Yeah . My name is Hiro Nakamura , and the fate of the world is in your hands . So Peter Petrelli is your uncle . You didn 't know that ? There 's a lot of things they never told me . I thought Peter was the only person who could protect me . And now you 're here . Why did you come here with them ? The people I used to work for have a tracking system . They can find anybody anywhere in the world . We came here to destroy it . That 's the only way we can ever start over . Build a normal life . Is that even possible ? I mean , I 'm not normal and they 're not normal . Everything that 's been happening to us has been so monumentally un-normal . I mean , maybe Peter 's right . Maybe we all have a destiny , and it 's to save the world together . I just rode 26 hours from Texas to take down the evil bastards who want me dead , and you 're saying I should turn around and go back because of a painting that you saw ? Yeah . That and a dream . He might be nuts , Ted , but he 's not lying . He believes every word of it . They 'll take out the tracking system , then you 're gonna be free . Free ? I killed people with my powers , okay ? I didn 't mean to , but it happened . And now the FBI thinks I 'm a terrorist . Yeah , but you 're not a terrorist . You need to get out of town before you become one . There 's a town in Nebraska . Windy Fork , population 15 . I want you to go there and wait for me to contact you . He gave me directions . You 're sending your daughter with them ? Claire tells me she has a destiny . She stopped Ted from melting down once before and saved all our lives . She could do it again . She could stop both of you . You coming ? I 'm in . Me , too . We can do the photo op outside the polls . Yes , Marty . Marty ! I know we 're still behind . That 's why every vote counts . Exit polls have me five points down . Oh , I never listen to polls . Be ready , Nathan . Today you will become a congressman . In time , you will lead the country . As long as I let this city become a nuclear wasteland . And let my brother explode . You can 't stop that . No one can . But it 's what comes next , and that is entirely up to us . Your father would be very proud . Pop would have me committed for even considering this nonsense . Well , clearly , your mother didn 't tell you . Tell me what ? Your father was one of us , someone with great power . He tried to make a difference in the world . He did all he could , and when that wasn 't enough , he just gave up . Your father was weak . My father was my hero . And when I win ... Nathan ? I thought you were gonna see the boys before they went to school . They wanted to wish you good luck . Oh . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know you were here . That 's all right . I 'm just on my way out . Mrs. Petrelli , your husband is about to become a very powerful man . I would like to give you both a gift to honor his forthcoming victory . Something to make the days ahead a little easier . What is he talking about ? I don 't know . I can 't believe you let that man into our house . Honey , he 's my largest campaign contributor . He 's a thief and a liar and God knows what else . And if I win this election , he 'll be the reason . Why ? Because he gave you money ? Nathan , don 't forget who you are . I know exactly who I am . I 'm a man who 's being asked to make a hard choice for the greater good . And you will . And you 're gonna do great things , but you don 't have to sell your soul ! What ? What is it ? Your foot . It 's moving . What ? Oh , my God . Oh , Nathan . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! It 's a miracle . You know , I 've been thinking after we save the world , I may go on patrol . You know , jumping in front of bullets and dragging people out of burning buildings . You 're not gonna catch me wearing a cape , zipping around with my underwear outside my pants . Why do we have to rent a car ? Can 't we just fly to Nebraska ... in a plane ? The FBI 's got my face all over wanted posters . I wouldn 't get very far in an airport . Ted 's a fugitive . I can use that to get his power . What is it ? It 's Sylar . He 's here . He 's watching us . Right now ? He knows what Ted can do . We need to get off the streets . Who 's Sylar ? Would have been nice to have Heidi for the photo op . Something happened back at the house . Is she all right ? Yeah . She 's fine . She 's better than fine , actually . Nathan Petrelli ! Nathan ! We 'll make an announcement after the election . Nathan ! What 's going on ? Miracles , Marty . Nathan Petrelli , Nathan ! Nathan Petrelli ! No , I need to speak to Nathan . It 's all right . Mr. Hiro , how are you ? Fine . Thank you very much . We are trying to stop a bad thing . The bomb . Big boom . You must help , or bad future will come . Bad future ? Yes , we went there , but I was already dead . You become a bad person , Nathan . But you can come with us now , help us stop a bomb together . I 'm sorry , Hiro . I can 't stop it . Nobody can . It 's a pleasure to see you again . Thanks for your support . You already bad guy . You are villain ! Villain ! Thank you all . Villain ! That 's Petrelli ? Yep . I don 't see Micah or Linderman . We know they 're in town . Nathan can tell us where . He 'll never see us coming . Hiro ! Mr. Claremont ? It 's me . Hiro Nakamura . I spoke to you on the phone . About my problem . My God . The Kensei . What happened ? It got cold . Frozen . Then snap . Can you fix it ? Depends on him . Hiro ! I have a cousin who eats like you . He 's huge . So am I. You said you like comic books , so I bought you a stack . Anything good ? The original Silver Surfer number one ? This must have cost you a fortune ! Yeah . You 're nice , even when you 're scary . I just don 't understand why you 're working for such a bad guy . You could use your power to be a hero . Oh , okay . No , you 're just too young to see how much the world sucks , how people can be so mean to each other just because of where they were born or what they look like . Mr. Linderman 's gonna change all that . He 's gonna heal the world . I didn 't know it was sick . Candice . Mr. Linderman . How are you ? Good . And how is our boy ? Good , sir . I wanna see my mom . After today , you can go home . I don 't believe you . I 'm sure other grownups talk down to you , Micah . I 'm not gonna make that mistake . I 'm gonna look you straight in the eye and tell you one simple truth . What you do here today with your incredible ability is going to save many lives . What do you want me to do ? What comes naturally . Talking to machines . And after that , you 'll take me home ? I 'll tell you what . I 'll do better than that . You do as you 're told , and I 'll make sure that you and your parents have enough money to live happily ever after . So this guy Sylar , he kills people like us ? Yeah , to take what we can do . How does he manage that ? He rips your head open . Then I say we stick with the plan , get out of the city . Get out of here . Go ! Federal agents . On your knees ! Get out of here , Claire . Now ! Now ! Let 's go ! There were two others ! Find them . You 're under arrest . Agent Hanson ? I 've been chasing you all across the country , Ted . You know I 'm not a terrorist . Do I ? You blew up a van full of federal agents in Los Angeles . But I didn 't mean to hurt anybody . Good . Your next stop , Guantanamo Bay . Look , I 'm gonna need a concrete cell lined with lead . So everyone is safe ! We got him , thanks to your tip , Mister ... Mendez . Isaac Mendez . I thought I recognized Sprague from his picture in the post office . I knew it was my duty to call , especially with it being election day . Well , you helped us capture a very dangerous man . Most people wouldn 't take the risk . I 'm not most people . Hiro . Welcome , Miss Baker . Do you mind if I take my son into the voting booth with me ? I 'm trying to teach him about democracy in action . Oh , what a lovely thought . Follow me . I 've been thinking about how you make yourself look like that . You must bend light or something . How do you know this isn 't the real me ? Okay , Micah , it 's time to boot up . What do you want me to do ? You can tell computers what to do . So I want you to tell this one and all the others here to vote for Nathan Petrelli . After this , we do the same thing in 12 other precincts . We don 't have to go anywhere else . It says that they 're all networked . So from here , I can change every one in the city . It says that ? Yeah . How many votes does your boss want him to win by ? Make it a landslide . Can I go home now ? Sorry to interrupt your big day . How did ... I didn 't think I 'd be seeing you again . I thought after you tipped me off about Linderman , I figured you 'd be dead . And Niki thought that you were gonna take him out . Let me guess . He made you an offer that you couldn 't refuse . Something like that , yeah . We came here to find Linderman . Who are you ? He took our son . Why would he do that ? Something to do with you and the election . Kidnapping . That 's a serious accusation . I hope you have evidence . Cut the crap , Nathan . We both know that you hate Linderman as much as we do . You were gonna kill him . Let us finish the job . Look , whatever you think you 're getting from this man , he 's gonna take back 10 times more from you . And he ain 't never gonna stop until everything you care about is gone . If I tell you where Linderman is , I have to know that he 's not gonna come after us . The man took my son . He 's gonna pay for that in full . Takezo Kensei longed to unite Japan . He went to the dragon of Kiso Mountain and asked the dragon to teach him the secrets of the sword . The dragon taught him to become the Kensei , a sword saint . He fought his enemies and won , saving his people . Then the dragon came to his palace , demanding the life of the princess . Kensei drew his sword and plunged it into his own heart . He handed it to the dragon and said , " My love is in here . Take it . " And then he died . Tracking system 's on the 42nd floor . Get a read on someone . Yeah . You sure there isn 't another way ? The reason I brought you here , Parkman , was so that you could get us to those elevators without raising a ruckus . Now , if you can 't do that , you might as well give up on your wife and unborn child right now . Because no matter how far you run , they will find you . Okay . A simple " no " would have done the trick . Good morning , Stanley . Okay , I got it . Good morning , sir . Stanley , hey , man . I just took my buddy to lunch . I forgot my ID . Can you buzz us through ? I don 't know you . It 's Matt from accounting on 3-6 . What are you talking about ? We just went to Ray 's for an egg parm . I 'm gonna need to see your ID , buddy . Stan , come on , buddy , you don 't remember ? Remember on the weekend , I ran into you at the ... At that restaurant ? Where did I take Tanya , Shopsin 's ? Shopsin 's . Right ? You introduced me to Tanya . I did ? Drank and , God , I hope I didn 't ... You okay , Stan ? Remember ? You were really drunk . And you were worried about people finding out about the ... You know , the porno . Oh , hey , yeah , don 't worry about it . Here . Right . You guys go ahead . Have a good day . Thanks . Thanks , Stan . No problem , sir . The password doesn 't work . They must have changed the protocol . Great . We have to wait until you can pick it out of somebody 's head . We gotta move . Right now . That blonde works for Linderman . Let 's go . Linderman could be on any floor . Then we 'll search them all . Come on . Mr. Hawkins , Ms. Sanders , relax . My friend can hear your thoughts . He says we have similar goals . Didn 't I throw you out a window ? You 're responding well to the treatment . The important question is how are you feeling , Molly ? Good , I guess . As long as I don 't get any more shots . The antibodies in my blood are a cure for the virus . I 'm afraid we will need to continue the treatments . But I 'm all better . See ? Look what I can do . Just like before I was sick , I think about someone , and I know where they are in my head . Right here . How do I know you 're not playing a trick just to get out of more shots ? Now , you 've put that pin in this building . Is that supposed to be me ? No . It 's my other hero . If he 's here , can I see him ? Your other hero ? The police officer that saved me from the bogeyman . Molly , if your power has returned , we can stop the bogeyman so he never hurts anyone else . Can you think about him ? Show me where he is ? Are you sure you wanna know ? And how 's our favorite patient , Dr. Suresh ? Much improved . Molly says she can locate Sylar . We should go after him immediately . We will , soon . Right now , you need to go away with Molly . We have a helicopter on its way to take you both to a safe location . You 'll find Linderman on 51 . Good luck finding your son . Right . Nice to see you , too . How do we take out this tracking system ? Erase a hard disk , destroy a satellite link , what ? You did your part . This is mine . Surveillance picked them up in the elevator . What does he want ? Molly . Good night , Bennet . It was Thompson . I heard him waiting for you . Anybody else ? No . He 's alone . All right , stay here ! What ? No , no , I don 't have a gun ! What am I thinking now , Parkman ? Your last thought . How 'd you know he was gonna come up on me ? We were old friends . Dr. Suresh ? I thought I heard a noise . It 's nothing , Molly . Go back to your room , okay ? Good girl . Look , whatever happens in here , you gotta know this is the only way our families are ever gonna be safe . Why ? What do you mean ? What 's here ? Where 's the tracking system ? It 's in there . That 's the tracking system ? A kid ? We came here to kill a little girl ? No . No , I knew it was a person , but I had no idea . Lower your gun . As long as she 's alive , my daughter will never be safe . None of them will . Lower your gun , or I will kill you . Shoot me , and she dies . I 'm hurt ! I think it 's bad ! Here , let me help . Ando ! Ando ? Where is my friend ? He bought one of my Nagamakis and left . He bought a sword ? He said if you weren 't going to save the world , he would . Hey , move the car ! Come on , get moving ! Is this the only way out of the city ? No , but it 's the fastest . This is the sickest thing I 've ever seen . Did this happen in the accident ? The top of the guy 's head came off ! How else does that happen ? You don 't wanna know . Sylar got him . He killed Ted . Does that mean Sylar can do what Ted can do ? He 's the one . He 's gonna wipe out the entire city . You 've gotta stop him . I don 't think I can . The last time I fought Sylar , he killed me . Come on . Come on . Yes , we 'll send a helicopter to retrieve the Petrelli family . Just make sure they 're not late . Bill . Jessica ? Oh , I must admit , I 'm quite surprised to see you here . Where 's Micah ? She asked you a question . You wouldn 't even have Micah if it wasn 't for me arranging your relationship , crafting your opportunities . What gives you the right to ruin our lives , take our boy from his home ? Your money ? You think being rich makes you better than us ? Well , social Darwinism did play its part . I believe destiny to be intrinsic . Your destiny is to give me back my son . He 's in the building , 42nd floor . I 'll go look for Micah . Watch him . You 'll never see him again , you know . How 's that ? Jessica 's gonna kill you for me . Open the bag . You just caught me preparing for a trip . Yes . Well , consider this a deposit with more to follow . How much more ? You can 't be listening to this ! Of course she is . Like most women whose lives have been ruined by men , all Jessica really wants is security , and money buys that . Money 's all she 's ever really cared about . She cares about our son . How much ? Five , $ 10 million ? Think about Micah . You saw that painting . You came here to save him . All right . Twenty million dollars to kill your husband and walk away . He 's right , D.L. I wanna take the money . I really do . I would even kill you for it . But Niki wouldn 't . D. You don 't love him . Everything I 've done , I did for them . You should have taken the money . I 'm still here . I don 't care what he said . Me and you getting together , that was real . Jessica wasn 't the strong one . It was you . Baby ... I feel so stupid sitting here . I wanna jump out of this damn chair . People don 't believe in miracles . When the time is right , we 'll tell everyone . We 're ready . Thank you . Thank you all . Thank you very much for your amazing support . A landslide . That 's what they 're calling it . I 'm sorry my brother couldn 't be with us tonight . But I know that Peter cares about this city more than anyone . You know , our father always said that we had a responsibility to use what God gave us , to help people , to make a real difference . Pop always made the hard choices for the greater good . He believed in that . And so do I. Our children deserve that . They deserve a better future , a future where they don 't have to face their fears alone , but can look into the darkness and find hope . I challenge everyone in here to inspire by example to fight the battle , no matter the cost . Because the world is sick . It 's spinning out of control . But we can help . With our help , it can heal . With our love , with our compassion , and with our strength , we can heal it . Let 's put aside our differences . Let 's embrace our common goals . Let 's do it for our children . Let 's show them all exactly what we 're capable of . Thank you all . Thank you very much . Thank you . Boom .

We are his legacy . Thank you for joining us this morning . This is his legend . give it to me in a nutshell . Light up the darkness . the premise is quite simple . Take something designed by nature and reprogram it to make it work for the body rather than against it . - We 're talking about a virus ? - Yes . the measles virus which has been engineered at a genetic level to be helpful rather than harmful . I 'm not- - l find the best way to describe it is if you can imagine your body as a highway and you picture the virus as a very fast car being driven by a very bad man imagine the damage that that car could cause . But then if you replace that man with a cop the picture changes . And that 's essentially what we 've done . how many people have you treated so far ? 009 clinical trials in humans so far . - And how many are cancer-free ? - Ten thousand and nine . So you have actually cured cancer ? we have . What you see ? What you see ? Damn . Sam . Come on . I 'll tell you . Not only was this the biggest snowstorm in New York City history it had to be one of the prettiest . Imagine waking up on Sunday to 26.9 inches of snow in New York City . Here you go . Just the way you like it . Disgusting . excuse me . relax . trains and automobiles . a Turkish Airlines flight skidded off the runway at JFK . Matt ... . There you go . attempting the Bob Hager rule of thumb here . And I 'm gonna plug my ruler in . Matt . Matt and Katie . at least . - And then it turns brown . If that . thanks so much . no .

I forgive you for stabbing me in the back ! you 're afraid of your own feelings . Go away . See ? just like you did to Fiona ... maybe love you . a hideous creature . I heard the two of you talking . she was talking about somebody else . I 'm afraid the eggs are powdered . Obviously you know that . They 're yours . which is about the most fantastic thing in history . And some antibiotics in the bathroom . because your leg is okay but it won 't be for very long if you don 't start a course soon . Who are you ? I 'm Anna and that 's Ethan . Don 't let it get cold . It 's okay . Go on . We came from maryland . We heard your message on the radio . We were at the pier at noon . We waited all day . We 're going to Vermont . To the survivors ' colony . What ? In Bethel. lt 's a safe zone . there 's no safe zones . Nothing happened the way it was supposed to . Nothing worked the way it was supposed to . In the mountains . There 's a whole colony of people there who didn 't get sick . The virus couldn 't survive the cold . There 's a colony- - Shut up ! Shut up ! Everybody 's dead . Everybody is dead . I just need- - l need a minute . Okay ? Just ... . l just- - l was saving that bacon . I was saving it . I 'm just- - l 'm gonna go upstairs . All right ? Just- - l 'm gonna go . put the knife down . You there ! Ogre . Aye . By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility . really ? You and what army ? Can I say something to you ? really something back there. incredible . Are you talking to me ? I was talking to you . You was really great back there . and bam ! Tripping over themselves like babes in the woods . That really made me feel good to see that . it 's good to be free . why don 't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends ? Hm ? uh I don 't have any friends . And I 'm not going out there by myself . Wait a minute. I got a great idea . I 'll stick with you ! green fighting machine . Together we 'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us . I Iike Shrek . That was really scary . If you don 't mind me saying ... your breath will get the job done ... because your breath stinks ! you almost burned the hair out of my nose . Just like the time ... . are you ? Thank you for my leg . Okay . Where have you been ? I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship out of São Paulo . Those boats weren 't meant to be permanent . they weren 't . we started docking to take on supplies . Someone picked it up on shore . Five of us were immune . You said five ? The Darkseekers got them . aren 't you ? It 's too late today . we can make it to Vermont in a straight shot . - So if you had- - - l 'm not leaving . This is ground zero . This is my site . I 'm not gonna let this happen . I can still fix this . What happened to your leg ? That 's my snare . These are my materials . The infected didn 't do this . They can 't . - How do you know ? - They have no higher brain function . They don 't plan or hate . They don 't love . They can 't . Could they be evolving ? Ethan . Ethan . It 's cold . We gotta go . I 've been cooking the compounds . What ? lce. I need ice . Whoa . You scared me . - Sorry . I called down twice . thank you . it 's safe . I 've never seen one so still . They 're always biting . You think that can cure her ? this will almost certainly kill it but it 's possible by drastically reducing the body temperature I can increase the compound 's effectiveness . Did all of them die ? Yes . My God . we did . Where can Ethan sleep ? He 's heavy . Can you get that ? She 's beautiful . What 's her name ? Marley . - Her name was Marley . - lt 's a beautiful name . Yeah . We named her after Bob Marley . the singer . Damian ? his father . His father . Nope . I shot the sheriff But I didn 't shoot the deputy that is unacceptable . - What ? Best album ever made . - You don 't recognize that ? - Mm-mm . Wow . it was kind of a virologist 's idea . He believed that you could cure racism and hate . Literally cure it by injecting music and love into people 's lives . he was scheduled to perform at a peace rally . Gunmen came to his house and shot him down . Two days later he walked out on that stage and sang . Somebody asked him why . The people who are trying to make this world worse are not taking a day off . How can I ? Light up the darkness . Neville . To the colony . Anna . Everything just fell apart . - There was no evacuation pIan- - - You 're wrong . There is a colony . okay ? Anna ? I just know . how do you know ? How could you know ? God told me . He has a plan . - God told you ? - Yes . - The God ? - Yes . - l know how this sounds . - lt sounds crazy . But something told me to turn on the radio . Something told me to come here . Anna . You were trying to kill yourself last night ? Anna . I got here just in time to save your life . That 's a coincidence ? - Just stop it . Stop it . Stop . - He must have sent me here for a reason . the world is quieter now . You just have to listen . If we listen we can hear God 's plan . - God 's plan ? - Yeah . All right . Let me tell you about your God 's plan . There were 6 billion people on Earth when the infection hit . KV had a 90 percent kill rate . That 's 5.4 billion people dead . dead . Less than 1 percent immunity . me and Ethan . The other 588 million turned into your Darkseekers . And then they got hungry . And they killed and fed on everybody . Everybody ! Every single person that you or I has ever known is dead ! Dead ! There is no God . There is no God . What is that ? Was it still dark when you brought us home last night ? You were bleeding . There was light on the horizon . Turn the light off . Turn it off . They followed us home . Ethan . Shit . Anna . Anna . Anna ! Anna ! Anna ! Anna ? Anna . Come on . Come on . - Are you okay ?

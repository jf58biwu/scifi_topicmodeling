I was flying around with my jet pack , just smokin ' rebels with my laser . Ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom . Han Solo was all , " hey , wait . " And I 'm like , " oh , I 've been waiting for this for a long time , Solo . " Ba-bang ! The big , bad Wookiee be growling in hell now . I even put one between Skywalker 's eyes , right between those pretty baby blues . But then Jabba the Hutt was all , " oh , no , this guy 's too badass , man . " So then 80 Jedi showed up . I took out about 67 of them , but then 20 dudes finally flanked me . And I was like , " you know what , kids ? It 's been real , daddy-o , but I 'm not giving you the pleasure . " So I jumped into the pit myself . On the way down , I was thinking , maybe I should have left ' em a party favor . Oh , I did - - a thermo detonator right up their ass . Ba-boom ! Oh , that 's awesome . At least you didn 't go out like a punk . Yeah . Oh , ' cause I looked like a badass . [ sniffles ] [ sobbing ] Are you crying ? No . Huh ? That 's funny .

Ha ha ! is that yours ? No , for the hundredth time , that 's that same stupid black bag . Mine doesn 't have a stripe . It 's like that stripy bag is mocking me . [ bleep ] you , stripy bag . Well , my suitcase is gone . Sacrificed to the airport gods . Now I 'm here for two [ bleep ] weeks with one [ bleep ] robe . All right , now it 's sticking to me like a wet Kleenex .

Yeah , reach up there with your Staff of Ra and - - [ air gusting ] Hey , want to see me tempt fate ? Could this day get any worse ? I did it ironically , so I think I 'm safe . What are you doing ? Put me down . Aaaah ! [ chickens clucking " Star Wars " theme ] Convene all ships on Endor . I want the moon obliterated and the Rebels wiped from the face of the galaxy . Sorry , sir . Actually , we can 't . The Rebels have won . What do you mean , they won ? We have tens of thousands of ships . - We - - we control countless worlds . - Yeah . We have millions of troops at our disposal . But they just blew up the second Death Star and killed the Emperor . So ? So , that means they won . How does that mean they won ? They blew up the first Death Star years ago , and the fighting continued . Yes , but they didn 't kill the Emperor . They had to do both . We can 't fight back ? No . Sorry . This is the end of the Empire . Really ? Yeah , ' fraid so . That 's it , then . What do we do now ? I guess we can go get a massage . Let 's do that .

 Previously on Eureka ... - Jack ? - Abby ? What are you doing here ? Zoe . That 's my mom . I asked you to wait . Has she spoken to you ? - What ? - You told her . This is so like you ! I don 't wanna look like the bad guy because you come and take away my kid . What are you talking about ? We had an agreement when you came to live here . A year , and then you were supposed to come back to LA with me . You 've already ruined your own lives . Just leave mine alone . Were you seeing Kim ? More during the months leading up to her ... To the accident . So you never visited her lab ? No . Hey . What 's up ? Noise complaint from the neighbors . What neighbors ? The ones three miles down the road . Exactly what kind of noise are they complaining about three miles down ... - Never mind . - Yeah . Oh . Hello ? Ah , excuse me , sir ? - Yes ? - Hi , I 'm sheriff Jack Carter , and you are ? Busy . What is it that you need ? Listen , Dr. Bajanian , we 've had a noise complaint , and we 're gonna have to ask you to keep it down . But I 'm working on simultaneously configuring the position and momentum of electrons so they 'll no longer be conjugate variables , thereby debunking Heisenberg 's uncertainty principal . And as exciting as that may be , we 're still gonna have to ask you to keep it down . Fine . Looks like you have an oil leak . That 's ununseptium , a highly volatile halogen . Whose effects on human skin have yet to be tested . Right . So not an oil leak . Carter ! I told you to watch your head . No , you didn 't . Okay , you know you need special permission to use transuranic elements - outside of Global , right ? - Of course . Okay , so let me see your permit , Doctor . I 'm sure they 're on file , Deputy . While we go check that out , we 're going to , uh , have to ask you to still keep it down . Thanks for your time . Henry , are you sure about this ? - Allison ... - I can set you up in a brand-new lab - with twice the space . - Kim 's lab will do just fine . Then at least let me have someone clear out all the old stuff . No , you said you were gonna leave it the way it was the day she ... At least until I had time to go through it . I did and I have . It 's just ... This has to be hard for you . I see it as a chance to stay close to her , continue her work . You know , we used to finish each other 's sentences . So ... Okay . So Abby , you 're heading back to Los Angeles ? Yep , this is it . I 'm sorry to see you go . Oh , no , you 're not . Sheriff Carter and Zoe will miss you . No , they won 't . Perhaps if you weren 't taking Zoe away ... SARAH , forgive me if I don 't feel the need to justify my parental choices to a talking bunker . Fine . Don 't let the door hit you on the way out . You wanna piece of me ? Are you , uh , threatening the house ? She started it . Yeah . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I got a headache . - Where 's Zoe ? - She 's in her room . She 's okay . She 's using a virtual therapy device that Beverly gave her . It 's called an ATS . I 'll tell ya , the things this town comes up with ... Oh , yeah , it 's a great place to live . I mean , it 's sort of full of mind-blowing opportunities and brilliant minds at the top of their game . And the schools ... amazing . Yeah ? Are you really okay with this ? We had an agreement . I know . But I don 't want you to do that thing that you do , you know , when you say you 're okay with something and six months after that , we 're at my parents 50th wedding anniversary and you 've had one beer too many , and you ask my mom if the ball-buster gene comes from her side of the family ? You threw out my baseball cards . We were having a baby . We needed the room . I had a 1989 upper deck Ken Griffey , Jr . Rookie card . Do you have any idea how much that 's worth now ? No , and Dear God , before you tell me , let 's just try and swing this right around to my original point . Are you okay with me taking Zoe back to LA ? Yeah . I 'm okay . Okay . 'Cause the end of the semester 's coming , and I 'm gonna come back to get her . So ... I 'll call ya . Zoe ! How many times have I asked you not to leave your stuff lying around ? Zoe . Zoe ? Hey ! - I 'm talking to you here . - Hey , I 'm getting my head shrunk here . Well , shrink it after you 're done cleaning up your mess , okay ? Is that the , um ... IRS thing from Beverly ? ATS . She 's out of town and ... She thinks it 'll help me confront my inner fears and resolve my anger issues . How 's it working ? Well , I 'm still pretty pissed , so ... Do you wanna talk ? No , actually . I want you to leave me alone . Okay , that 's ... The exact opposite of leaving me alone . I know you 're upset . But your mom really misses you . We agreed to shared custody . And I think that , um , if you don 't give this a shot , you will regret it . Custody . Meaning ownership . Meaning I have no say . Zoe , your mom loves you a lot . Well , you know , I gotta give her credit . At least she 's willing to fight for me . I 'm gonna go clean up my stuff . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! What are you doing ? Uh , rearranging furniture . What are you doing here ? Well , I said I was taking the afternoon off , not quitting . - Okay . - Okay , so everything back in its place . Go . Sure , why should I get to be by the window ? Hey , um , did you pull those , permits I asked you to ? What ? The permits for , um , Bajanian 's contraption ? What are you talking about ? I swear , sometimes ... I wonder if you even listen to me . I feel like I 'm talking to myself . Jo ? Jo ? Hey , Sheriff . What can I get for ya ? Uh , nothing right now . Have you seen Jo ? - W - who ? - My deputy . Oh , you got a new deputy ? That 's great . I didn 't get a new deputy . I have a deputy . Deputy Jo Lupo . - Oh . - Yeah . Is he cute ? Okay , now you 're just bugging me . I really need to talk to her . Uh , listen , maybe I could help . Has anybody here ever heard of a , uh , deputy Lupo ? Sorry , no . Not me . Sorry , Sheriff . I don 't think anybody here has ever heard of her . The Projet-SG Team presents : Timing : Golgi , Linwelin . Edition : Golgi , Linwelin . Proofreading : Golgi , Linwelin . - Season 2 | Episode 4 - Games People Play ( v. 1.0 ) Henry ? Jack . Oh , there you are . Here I am . I thought you 'd be at Global today . No . - Jack , you need something ? - Do you know a woman named Jo Lupo ? No , don 't think so . Okay , this is really gonna sound strange . I have a deputy named Jo Lupo . Small , but surprisingly strong . Bit of a gun nut ? I had a conversation with her today , I turn my back for two seconds , and she 's gone . Like vanished , and no one in the town even remembers her . I think everyone is playing a trick on me , right ? So I go to her house , and , uh ... You know , the name on the mailbox is changed , and there 's a family with , like , 12 kids living there , and the house is a different color , which is a bit far to go for a prank . A bit , yeah . You think I 'm losing it , don 't ya ? Um ... You think you 're losing it ? I know this woman ! You know this woman ! All right , maybe something 's affected your body chemistry or altered your neural pathway somehow . Were you exposed to anything ? Yeah , I visited a guy , he was , uh , playing with ... a new , atlantic element . - Transuranic ? - Yes ! Yeah , that 's it . - Would that do it ? - No . - Okay . What else have we got ? - Well , um ... Maybe ... Maybe you fell into some freezing water , and , uh , you went into hypothermia . Or you suffered a trauma , and that sent you into shock . Wha ... - Yeah , I hit my head . - With what ? A heavy , metal object . How many times ? Repeatedly . Well , see ? That would have some effect . So if that 's our problem , get an MRI . Henry , I 've had a concussion before , that 's not it . Do you remember Occam 's razor ? Yeah. uh ... Simple things , uh , are true . Close enough . So you are either part of some ... theoretical , unknown , scientific discovery where people vanish from our world and memories , or ... you suffered a head trauma . When you say it like that ... Get an MRI . Yeah . I 'm not saying that you can 't have one . I 'm just asking why do you want one ? It 's not a big deal . It 's just , I bumped my head this morning and Henry thought it 'd be a good idea if I had it looked at . You having any dizziness , nausea , headaches ? No , my head was pounding earlier , but it 's fine now . Actually , it 's totally fine now . Problem solved . What 's he even doing here ? He works here . He was fired weeks ago . Okay , brain scan it is . Run an EEG and draw blood . No , I just need an MRI , thanks . Relax , it usually only takes me two or three tries to hit a vein . You 're pretty talented . - Really ? - No ! Do you know anyone who 'd be working on a ... really intense , unknown , theoretical scientific discovery ? You mean like a class eight project ? Yes . Let 's talk about those . Sorry , all class eight research is classified . Oh , you know what else should be classified ? A certain assistant 's american idol audition . - What ? - No , no ! Zoe promised me to delete that . What 's it gonna be ? Fine ! Gimme an hour . All right , so put the gown on , and all metal objects and jewelry in the tray . All right . Are you okay ? Uh , yeah . Just got a lot on my mind . You know , you can always talk to Beverly . First of all , no . And , second of all , she 's out of town . No , she 's not . I just saw her at Cafe Diem . R ... Well , then why 's she having Zoe do therapy from home today ? I don 't know , but ... is Zoe okay ? Actually , not so much . No . Abby 's taking her back to LA at the end of the semester as a part of our custody agreement . And are you okay with that ? Yeah . - It 's complicated . - Well , what do you think you should do about this ? I don 't know . What can I do ? I don 't know , but if someone was gonna take Kevin away from me , I would feel like my world was ending . Let 's get this over with . - Hey , how 's your head ? - A waste of time . The MRI was clear . Well , I wouldn 't rule out your injury just yet . It might not be me , though . I mean , it might be a , uh , class eight project ? And what do you know about class eight projects ? Mainly that I 'm not supposed to know about them . That 's true . I don 't think that 's your problem , most of that research is theoretical . I know , I know , and I know what I 'm asking isn 't probable , but is it possible ? Yeah , well ... It might have something to do with meta-material technology or vector decomposition or cellular irradiation . - Okay . - But none of those things could remove someone from the world 's consciousness . Unless ... it was some kind of transdimensional travel . Okay , let 's go with that . What 's that ? Movement between parallel universes . Right ... So you 're saying that Jo got zapped to another universe ? Or maybe you did . Theoretically , every universe is different . But the closer they are , the more alike they are , with maybe just a difference . A green sky instead of blue , - cats chase dogs or ... - In a town of 3,000 people , one isn 't where he 's supposed to be . Exactly . We should talk to Nathan about this . He 's good with this kind of thing . Great ! Thanks . You 're welcome . I was starting to worry if it was something to do with me . Well , that 's where the smart money still is . Funny . Henry ? Henry ? Henry ! You wanna run that by me one more time ? People are disappearing into this crazy light , and nobody remembers them but me . - People like ... - What difference does it make ? You 're not gonna know who I 'm talking about anyway . - I 'm gonna double-check your MRI . - There 's nothing wrong with my head . Well , what you 're describing simply is impossible . There 's no technology that could create such an anomaly . Not even in Eureka . Well , how about , um , many-materials technology or , like , the cell phone radiation or decomposing vectors ? And now you 're just putting words together . Okay , I don 't know what I 'm talking about , but Henry said that you would . - Henry ... - Henry Deacon . The ... How do you not remember ... He was a friend of yours . I have a lot of friends . Actually , not so much . But we 'll table that . Um , I think it has something to do with me , okay ? People interact with , people I know , but whatever it is , we must figure it out before it affects the 3,000 people in this town . You see , now I know it 's in your head , because Eureka 's only half that size . That means it 's spreading . Nathan , you gotta help me . - Okay . - Great . Where do we start ? You go home and get some rest . And I 'll start by double-checking your MRI . Come on . Come on . - Zoe ? - Hey , what 's up ? Hey , uh , where are you ? - Home . Why ? - All right , stay put . - What 's happening ? - I don 't know , but if you see a big flash of light , I need you to run . Just get away from it , - and you call me , okay ? - Seriously ? Seriously , um ... I 'll be in touch . Gotta go . Fargo ! Fargo . - Did you get it ? - Yes . But you can 't tell anyone I showed this to you . If you don 't show it to me , there might not be anyone left to tell . I have no idea what that means . Ah , you don 't have to . Why do you need it anyway ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . Huh , Stark 's on this list . Of course he is . He 's done more class eight projects than anyone else at Global . And this guy , I know him . Saw him this morning . Uh , Dr. Bajanian ? Yeah , he 's a quantum physicist . Any chance what he 's doing could punch a hole in another dimension ? Not likely , but when you start dealing with subatomic particles , the typical laws of nature no longer apply . Okay . Thanks . And , um ... You got a great voice . Don 't let anyone tell you different . Hey ! Allison . - What 's going on ? - I need you to come with me . There 's a noise complaint , outskirts of town . This guys is using an element he doesn 't have permission to use . - So make him get a permit . - Yeah , well , I 'm not supposed to know this , but he 's one of your class eight scientists . Carter , everyone knows who the class eight scientists are . Fargo said he 's working with atoms , and I think this guy Bajanian could be a really serious threat . - Who ? - Bajanian . Weird guy , lives on the outskirts of town . I know who Bajanian is . Who told you that he works with atoms ? Fargo . Oh , man . Hey , Sheriff . Soup ? Ya hired Larry the kiss-ass ? - Okay , Carter , I have work to do . - Alisson . Whatever this guy 's doing , it makes people disappear , and I seem to be the only one who 's noticing . Please . Please come with me . And watch your head . He 's got this big booming machine with lots of little things spinning ... You 'll see . Dr. Bajanian ? Dr. Bajanian ? This can 't be happening . Can I help you ? Where 'd you put it ? - Sorry ? - Where ? The machine with the lights and swirling ? Could you be a little more vague ? The thing you built to find out how fast the electrons are moving . I was right here this morning . I saw it . What were you doing in my lab ? I know you 're up to something . I 'm gonna figure out what it is . Miss Blake . I 'm sorry about the intrusion , Dr. Bajanian . Let 's go . Carter , there 's nothing here . Let 's go . Move ! Not again . I can 't believe it got him too . What are you talking about ? You have no idea of what happened ? I know you dragged me out to an empty lab . And you 're starting to scare me . We gotta get outta here . - Where are you gonna go ? - I 'm not sure . I 'm glad you thought this through . We 'll get Kevin , we 'll get Zoe , and we 'll get out of dodge while we still can . Avoiding the issue isn 't going to help resolve it . When the issue is that the people I care about keep disappearing , I 'm willing to do whatever it takes . Listen to me . I trusted you . I need you to trust me . Let 's just go back to the office , I promise , we will figure this out . You wanna help ? Here . One of the 20 people on that list knows exactly what 's going on . Help me figure out which one . Carter , there is nothing written on this piece of paper . Please . I know that I can help you . Carter , we need to slow down and talk about this . I 'm telling you , we gotta leave . It 's spreading . We can 't stay . Carter , just drink some water and calm down . - You 're dehydrated . - I 'm dehydrated ? You gotta kidding . Just drink the water . - I 'm fine . - Just drink it ! - Why the hell do I wanna drink ... - So I don 't have to do this . I 'm sorry . It was for your own good . How are you feeling ? Like somebody stabbed me in the back . And then stabbed me in the neck . I 'm sorry , there 's nothing else I could do . You were practically hysterical . I expect it from Stark . Not so much you . Stark ? Ex-husband Nathan Stark . Egomaniacal bane of my existence . That does sound like someone that I would marry ... But , no , I 've never heard of him . The only way to fix the problem , is to recognize that you have one . What is that ? AA ? - Carter ... - Allison , don 't I ... I mean , apart from the ... Remembering people that don 't exist thing , don 't I seem rational to you ? The former seems to negate the latter . - Why are you talking like Beverly ? - I 'm just trying to help you . Then think this through with me . How many offices are there at global ? - Over 1,000 . - How many people work there ? - Maybe 100 . - Doesn 't that seem odd to you ? We 're in a transitional period . Or your mind is reaching to justify what 's happening . I could say the same for you . Okay . But you gotta let me go get Zoe . I can 't deal with losing her . I won 't . Okay . Thank you . Allison , come here . Don 't let it touch you . Allison , move ! Everything 's gonna be all right . - SARAH , door . - Is everything okay ? Not even close . Zoe ! Zoe ! - What 's going on ? - Hey , sweetie . Um , get your shoes on , we gotta go , okay ? - What 's happening ? - No questions , just go . All right ? Okay , great . SARAH , how many people live in Eureka right now ? My current calculations say two ... You and Zoe . Okay , thank you . Back to the beginning . Zoe ! - Zoe . - I 'm coming . What do you remember about this morning ? What do you mean ? Okay , your mom was here , you and I got in a fight , you threw the thing at me and you left , right ? Okay , mom has never been to Eureka , I don 't member getting in a fight , and I don 't know what thing you 're talking about . The thing . The therapy thingy ... The ATS . What ? For the love of ... I was sitting here . And ... I had it in my hands . And I stood up . Dad . I never put it down . So ? So ... Then I go back downstairs and I see you on the couch . And I say that I 'm going off to the office ? Okay , that I remember . But nothing before that ? Nothing that you 've mentioned . So that 's our first shared memory . - I have no idea ... - What I 'm talking about . That 's the problem . And the only way to solve a problem is to recognize that you have one . Okay , you sound like my therapist . Or a therapy device . Right , like the same you had , the one I have no recollection of putting down . I mean , I must 've tried it on , right ? That 's why everybody sounded like Beverly . Except you . This is gonna be hard to swallow . I don 't think any of this is real . Okay . I think that I 'm ... We are ... in a program . And ... I don 't know how to find my way out . Dad , you 're freaking me out . Dad . Dad , can you hear me ? Dad , can you hear me ? Please wake up . I 'm so scared . Please . - Oh , sweetie . - Mom . I drove back as fast as I could . What happened ? I was doing my therapy on the ATS . And Dad walked in , and we got in a fight , and ... I threw it at him , and for some reason , he put it on , and when I walked back in , he was shaking and he wouldn 't wake up . And I shouldn 't have thrown it at him . Honey , it 's nobody 's fault . But can 't you just take this off ? We 're afraid that disconnecting him could send him into paralytic shock . So what is happening to him ? Actually , we 're not sure . The , ATS was developed in collaboration with Beverly Barlowe . But we 've never had this happen before . It 's a virtual version of Eureka , down to the very last detail . The user 's subconscious issues come to life in the game . Normally , they 're aware of what they 're experiencing , and they can leave the program at any time . We think the concussion may have caused a glitch in the mainframe , that Carter is unaware that he 's in an altered reality . Is his life in danger ? Someone answer me . Yes . It is . So let 's get Beverly down here and fix it . Well , we can 't reach her . So we sent Henry to her house to find any information that can help us . Beverly , this is Henry . I 'm in your house now . We really need your help . So when you get this message , call ! Dad , where are we going ? If this isn 't real , there has to be a way out , right ? - Like an exit sign ? - Yeah , I 'm not that lucky . You said this therapy thing is for confronting your fears , - working out anger issues ... - I don 't remember that . - Yeah , well , you said it . - And I 'm not angry . So maybe confronting fears is the way out . Yours or mine ? I 'm wearing the thing , so i 'm guessing mine . Okay , so what are you afraid of ? Right now , that . What is that ? ! That 's what 's been taking people . Dad , what are you doing ? Confronting my fear . I am so sorry . Are you okay ? I 'm ... Yeah . I 'm just , uh ... - Looking for a cup of coffee . - Allow me . I cook when I 'm upset . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . What are you all doing here ? We 're here for Carter and Zoe . All of you ? Yeah , I mean ... He 's our sheriff , and she 's our girl . - Did you find anything else ? - Just another ATS Device . I can take it apart , we can see the mechanics . - Well , if he can hold on that long . - Yeah . Hey , honey . There 's a whole lot of people out there who are worried about you . You wanna come say hi ? Not right now . You gonna eat ? He wouldn 't leave me . I 'm not gonna leave him . - Dad . - Come on . - What are you doing ? - Come on . Why aren 't we running ? We don 't have to . You 're gonna go . It 's gonna take you . I 'm gonna stay with you . Dad ! What 's happening ? We 're losing him . Wait ! He 's fighting . - Dad ! - Jack , you 're all right ! I thought I 'd lost you . Oh , no , never . No . No , no , no . I knew you wouldn 't leave . I 'm here . Looks good . Looks very good . Well , great . Henry said you could have visitors ? Yeah , yeah , that 'd be great . Okay , guys , come on in ! You look great . Zoe , hi . Hi . Abby ! Hey , good to see ya . Hey , Chris . Thanks very much . I really appreciate it . Thanks for that . Hey , thanks for that . Hey , thank you so much . How many of you are there ? Hi . Hey . Hey , how you feeling ? A little strange . You know , I have all these ... memories and ... feelings about things that never happened . Well , that 's gotta be pretty surreal . You have no idea . Anyway , I just stopped by to see if you were okay . To see if I 'm okay ? Yeah , this is your first day back in Kim 's lab . I know that 's a big deal . Jack , it 's fine . Really . I mean , you 're the one we should be worrying about . They told me ... The therapy thing was forcing me to deal with my feelings about losing Zoe . Apparently I have ... abandonment , entitlement , and intimacy issues . - Ha , congratulations . - Thank you . Even though that wasn 't actually you , you helped me a lot in there . I don 't know what I 'd do without you . Me too . I should get going . Abby 's taking off , we gotta talk before she goes , so ... All right , well , good luck and ... thanks . Yeah . You wanted me to stop by . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I think we should talk . Yeah , I know . I 'm happy here . Yeah , I know I complain about it , and ... It definitely has its quirks . - Yeah , that 's one way of putting it . - Yeah . But ... I belong here . - And I 'm doing some good . - You do . And you are . And I think this place has been good for Zoe . You know , I think she fits in here somehow . Well , maybe that 's ' cause she doesn 't fit in anywhere else . She has some good friends . Yeah , I 've noticed that . And I would never ask you to ... you know , not take her . That wouldn 't be fair to you or Zoe . - Jack , listen , I ... - That being said ... I can 't go ... months without seeing my kid . Can 't even go days , really . So ... I 'm ... gonna ask for my job back in LA . Really ? Yep . It 's funny , you remind me the man I once married . So what do you think ? I think this place needs you . And it wasn 't until today that I realized just how much Zoe needs you . And I can 't take you away from here . I can 't take her away from you . - But ... - This is where she needs to be . Thank you . I love you , Jack Carter . SARAH , door . Good evening , Sheriff Carter . Will the former Mrs. Carter be joining you for dinner ? Relax , SARAH , she 's gone . What a shame . Sarcasm doesn 't become you . Is ... What are you doing ? Oh , I 'm sorry , I meant to have all this cleaned up before you got home . Oh , it 's okay . It doesn 't matter . Leave it . Your mom and I had a talk . I told her how much you love it here , and ... That you ... You wanna stay . And I told her that I would respect our agreement . What did she say ? Oh , she seems to think that ... I need adult supervision . So ... If you 're up for the task ... I think I can handle it . I never wanted you to leave . I never wanted to go . Dad ... Thank you for ... fighting for me . SARAH , what are you doing ? That was such a beautiful moment , I thought musical accompaniment seemed appropriate . Yeah , on second thought , LA 's not looking so bad . Well , you 're stuck with us now , so ... what do you say ... burgers , Cafe Diem ? Sounds good . Oh , SARAH , knock it off .

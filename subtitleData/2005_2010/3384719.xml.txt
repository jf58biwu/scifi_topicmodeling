 re.edited.by.font color = " lime " npdv Isaac Mendez is dead . This is the last posthumous issue . But it 's not the last story . The day that he died , Isaac mendez bequeathed his sketchbook To a humble bike messenger . You find that messenger , You find your story . It 's got nothing to do with dad . I 'm going to Pinehurst . His idea , Giving people abilities , The right people . It 's wrong. it 's not wrong . It 's so right . We 're taking Claire with us . That 's what we came for in the first place . Well , I 've read your files , gabriel . You 're not their son . They 're just leveraging your mommy issues . And turning you into their weapon . And I understand now That I 'm never gonna change . Theoretically this formula is sound , But something is missing , Some kind of catalyst . The key component of this catalyst Would live in a human host . I think I 'm the catalyst . That 's Claire , and that 's hiro hiding behind the ferns . I think hiro has to take Claire here To get his memory back . Hiro ! Heroes.Season3.Episode12 " Our Father " What did you do ? What the hell is going on ? Dad ? That baby 's me . You 're Hiro Nakamura , aren 't you ? Hiro Nakamura ! Yes ! Peter told me about you . You 're a time traveler , So you brought me back in time . Why did you bring me here ? You don 't speak english ? Oh , look . Is that you ? Am I here for you ? Where is train station ? I must use toilet . More waffles , please . Hiro . Mommy ! Hey , where are you going ? Should I stay with me , or should I go with you ? Hey , what am I supposed to do ? Our son can hear us . Speak english . Are you feeling better ? We must face the inevitable . I am dying . I think it will happen tonight . We must make arrangements For the catalyst Before it is lost forever . The catalyst . Are you sure ? Nothing will ever be the same . You must think of the future , kaito . I will have Noah return with the baby . She is the perfect candidate . I wanted to keep it in the family . Absolutely not . Our son couldn 't possibly . This conversation isn 't over yet . - I think I can stop the catalyst . - I think my mommy can heal my brain ! I have to follow my dad , protect that baby , So they don 't inject the catalyst into me . I 'll meet you here tonight . Stay out of trouble , okay ? Okay . What ? You were supposed to be here by now . Where 's Claire ? Gone into thin air . What happened ? Don 't know , don 't care . I 'm not helping you anymore , Arthur . I 'm not helping anyone . I talked to Bennet . he told me everything . He told me you 're not my father . I want the truth . And I know exactly where I 'm gonna find it . I 've got a whole new list of people with abilities . It 's gonna be very useful . Don 't do this . Come see me . Don 't worry , I will . Very soon . Good-bye , Elle . One shot to the back of his head And it 's done . You want me to kill him ? Why do you think I sent you and your brother To find the haitian ? He makes Arthur vulnerable . And now that Nathan Has switched his allegiance , It 's all up to you . Your father is far too powerful . He won 't be contained . If the tables were turned , He would not hesitate to put a bullet in your brain , Or Nathan 's . Why do you think I poisoned him , The man I loved , Father of my children ? He tried to kill your brother . And if you get in his way , he will destroy you . You don 't know that . I know that he will stop at nothing To get what he wants By any means necessary , no matter who gets hurt . There 's no other way . So D.O.D. is on board. we 're all set . Well done , Tracy . Nathan , nice to see you . What are you doing here ? It 's my job , Senator- - Finding opportunities for you . Have you reconsidered my offer , son ? I agree with what you 're trying to do . The world 's a dangerous place and it 's not getting any better . We need a leader , somebody with vision . And that somebody isn 't you . Is it you ? I 'm taking over pinehurst , The complete program . I 'll work out of my office . We can use my resources . Who do you think you 're talking to ? I made you . You wouldn 't have gone To all this trouble to make me If you didn 't need me . You wanted a legitimate face for Pinehurst , A person with authority . Senator Nathan Petrelli . All right , Nathan. you win . Brief him on what we 've done . You 're angry . What do you expect ? You went behind my back . You 're supposed to be working for me . That 's exactly what I was doing . We 're on your side , Nathan . Your father sees the problems in this world- - War , terrorism . He wants to make it a better place . You have no idea who my father is . I know he 's crossed some lines , But he has a vision for the future , And you 're in it as president of the united states . That is where you belong , Nathan . And I belong there with you . We 'd like to call it " intelligent design . " Until now abilities have been random , Given to good people and bad , Whether they deserve them or not . When we perfect the formula , We get to choose who gets what power . And we have chosen the best . Meet the future . Fall in ! A-ten-hut ! Okay , almost there . Hang in there . Oh , gosh . Come on. hang in there . Okay , here we go . Oh , my gosh , let me help you . Oh , thanks . Oh , my husband bailed on me . Our first day with an adopted baby , And he had to go back to work . Oh , my gosh , thank you . No worries . I 'm Bonnie , by the way . I 'm staying next door with the monacos . I 'm their niece . Hi , Bonnie . I 'm Sandra . Thank you so much . Put ' em anywhere . Thank you . Come on , baby girl . Here we go . We made it home . Nice place . She 's probably just wet And doesn 't know how to tell you yet . Let 's see . Up we go . There we go . Yeah , she 's definitely wet . You want me to change her ? sure . There we go . There we go , little one . There we go . I 'm so glad I ran into you . To be honest , I 'm a little overwhelmed . She 's so little . And I 'm completely unprepared . I don 't have a clue about how to take care of a baby . Well , I have a feeling you 'll do just fine . Besides , I have major babysitting skills . I could teach you a thing or two if you want . That would be great . What about your husband , is he good with kids ? Not really . Noah 's very busy at work . He just got a promotion . Apparently he is , um- - He 's very good at what he does . I 'll bet he is . All done . There we go . Thank you . There we go . Oh , it 's so strange . I 've only known Claire a few hours , And I 'm so in love with her . I think she knows that . Yeah . Don 't let her out of your sight , okay ? What do you mean ? Oh , I just mean that She 's gonna grow up really fast . Believe me , I am gonna watch her like a hawk . Hi , baby girl . Hey , Sue , is it really your birthday ? Hey , birthday girl ! Sue Landers ? Special delivery . You 're lying . You 're not here to make a delivery . Impressive. how did you do that ? What do you want ? To understand what you do . Human lie detector , how does that work ? When someone tells a lie , does it tingle ? How did you know about me ? Who are you ? Someone who covets your ability . I have to find out the truth about something . No , you don 't . Trust me . I 'm sure it 's hard , Seeing the ugly truth at every turn . It must make it hard to trust anyone . It 's not gonna hurt a bit . Got me . That 's a lie . I almost forgot how good this feels . Happy birthday ! Cake . Tell me what you know about this program . It 's gonna make us better marines , sir . Yeah. but how ? Not exactly sure . Some kind of drug . I 'm told it 's safe . Sergeant , I want you to know Exactly what it is you 've signed up for . The drug that we 're developing , It 'll change your life In ways you can 't possibly imagine . Forever . I get it , sir , but I have my reasons . I did two tours in iraq . In the last mission , last tour , RPG took out our Humvee Three klicks south of kirkut . Boatload of hadjis has us pinned down , And we fought as best we could . End of the day though , 12 of us went in , only 2 came out . That 's tough . The trip back to stateside , I couldn 't help thinking , " why couldn 't I have been better ? " You 're being too hard on yourself , marine . Everybody says that . You 're only human . If only I was more than that , Maybe they 'd still be alive , you know ? Yeah , I think I do . I like teleporting better . Less windy . I don 't care where you are. hey . It should been there an hour ago . They 're ready. get it to them . Excuse me , we 're looking for a messenger . Sure , pal , what do you need delivered ? We need to find something , someone . Yeah , a messenger picked up a package From an artist at a downtown loft , Isaac mendez . We need that package . Sorry , can 't help you out . Johnson , 57th and lex ! The messenger picked up this package last year . If you just- - Wait , last year ? you 're kidding me . I can barely keep track of what we delivered last week . You have records , right ? receipts . Just look it up . His name was Isaac Mendez . M-e-n-d-e- - Look , I would like to help . City regulations prevent me from talking about deliveries . There 's no city regulation about that . What are you , a cop ? - He knows something , matt . - Right . Sorry to do this to you , buddy . He does know about the sketches . Wait , how do you know that I know ? I also know that you 're skimming off the top . What , $ 5,200 already this year . Give us the sketches now . Okay , fine . I got it in the back . It 's in the safe . I 'll go get it . That 's a great idea . We found them . Hey , you 've been a good friend to Hiro , Nemesis . How come ? Well , it 's kinda my fault . I mean , I started this whole mess stealing the formula- - No , no , no , it 's more than that . You 're doing it because that 's the right thing to do , And that 's who you are . Guys . He 's getting away . He 's got the sketchbook . we have to stop him . Allow me . Hey , watch it ! Watch out ! What the- - Fine , I give . Remember , fifth grade a boy named Danny . He 's cute , but he 'll break your heart , So whatever you do Do not share your juice with him . Don 't do it . Don 't do it , okay ? Who are you ? I 'm , uh- - I 'm , uh- - I 'm Bonnie . I was just watching the baby While sandra set up the nursery . Hi , hon . I thought I heard you come in. how 's work ? You left the baby alone with some strange girl ? She 's not strange . Bonnie , this is mr . Bennet . She 's a potential new babysitter for us . Is there a problem ? You can 't let a stranger come in our home Under any circumstances . Don 't worry , Claire . I 'm here to protect both of us . Something wrong ? Tell me who you are again . I 'm the Monacos ' niece . The Monacos don 't have a niece . So I 'm gonna ask you one last time . Who are you ? And what the hell do you want ? You don 't understand . I 'm here to protect her and this family . Who sent you ? What 's going on , Noah ? Nothing ; just go on back in the bedroom . Does this have something to do With how we got the baby ? No questions. that was the arrangement . Please , just go sit in the bedroom and wait . I 'll take the baby . No , everything is fine , Sandra . Please , just go . I know you 're scared . You 're a company man . And this little baby is your assignment . You 're thinking , how can she possibly Be your daughter when they could Take her away from you at any moment ? You 're trying so hard , But you can 't let yourself love her . What is this ? are you one of them ? Are you a mind reader ? Something like that . Believe me , this little baby Will be in your life for at least 16 more years . And many more hopefully after that . She 's gonna need you to protect her From so many things , Terrible things . But you 're gonna love each other so much . How do you know all this ? No , don 't answer that . Why not ? It 's the company , okay ? They want to take her back just for a minute . But they 're going to do something to her . And it 's gonna change everything . This little baby , your Claire-bear , She 's fine Just the way she is . Trust me . Claire-bear , huh ? Thank you . Your silence betrays you . What ? No , I 'm fine . You know , I was just thinking It 's too bad the eclipse had to end . The world be a lot simpler without powers . To kill one 's own father is a horrible thing . He tried to kill my brother . He took away my powers . He 'd kill me if he had to . But he didn 't . You and I both know The world isn 't safe with my father in it . But I also know you , Peter . You want to save the world . You always have . It 's that part of you that wants to save your father . Give the gun to me . I 'll do it . No . Just like your brother was your responsibility . This one is mine . Something wrong ? No . No . Does kind of tingle . I found it in some guy 's locker After he got canned . I had no idea how much it was worth . Every fanboy in the city 's been trying to grab it . My life 's been a living hell . I don 't understand . This is how it ends ? What 's happened to Hiro ? Maybe it 's not so bad . Right . Maybe this is just the cover to get people to buy it . Hiro will come back . He has to . 16 yeas ago . Cheerleader , it 's over . We can go home now . Hey , you speak english . - I thought that- - - it 's a long story . Just know that I have taken the catalyst . The light is in me now . We have saved the future . Wait , you put the catalyst in you ? Guess I showed up just in time . Keep away , Arthur Petrelli . I will save the cheerleader again . I don 't think so . I 'll take the catalyst and your powers too , Hiro . You 're a dead man . No ! Hiro . As for you , I need you to deliver a message for me . Tell Angela it 's over . I 've won . Cheerleader ! Hello ? ! Anybody there ? Help ! Help . Please . I can 't believe it . Hiro 's stuck back in time 16 years ago and no powers . Maybe it isn 't all bad news . Arthur Petrelli has the catalyst . He could perfect the formula . Yeah , wait , he- - he can give people powers . So that means that there could be another time traveler . Someone to save Hiro . Maybe it could be me . I can go back in time And save Hiro . We 've got to find the formula . How do we find the formula ? Doctor . Ready to change the world ? ID please . We 'll need 50 doses to begin- - One for every marine ? We 'll just try it on one first . Let 's make sure this thing works . No offense . What is it ? Nothing . Just a minor inconvenience . Call your first marine . I 'll be back . Peter . I 'm glad you 're here . Nathan and I have just been- - Don 't be ridiculous . So ... You 're here to kill me . I 'm here to stop you . Creating abilities like this , Giving them out , It 'll destroy the world . In your opinion . I 've seen it. this ends now . I don 't think you have the nerve to kill me , Peter . I like your choice . Very all-american . We could put him on a poster . Where 's my father ? We don 't need him . You 're in charge , remember ? All right , let 's do this . What the hell happened to you ? A mistake . Hopefully this formula will fix all that . What 's in there ? It 's all right , Scott . Who is this guy ? ! What 's happening ? I 'm not sure . He 's too strong . I cannot hold his powers back . Listen to me , son . There is another way . The formula is ready . Nathan is here . I can give you your abilities back . - We can start over . - No . Peter ! - Wait. just wait . - Shoot now . That your problem , son . Too much thought. not enough action . How could you be my son ? Hello , Arthur . Gabriel , you 're here . I am . No place I 'd rather be than with family . Are you really my family ? Of course . I 'm your father . No , you 're not . Now I know the truth . You 're not a killer , Peter . I am . There 'll be no need for that . I 'm not gonna kill you . You don 't have anything I need anymore . I 'm sorry , Peter . Your father was the one who had to die . Go after sylar . It 's over . How do you feel ? I feel good . re.edited.by.npdv

 JACK : Previously on Kings ... Some ministry positions have recently opened . And I 'm offering one to someone in name only . I think you two will enjoy working together . He came in a few hours ago . Counts bad and fever climbing . SILAS : Why do I ever leave ? I 'm happy when I 'm here . No . What is it ? The cost . Silas ? The bloody King of Carmel , Vesper Abadon . I 'm the only one who ever tells you the truth . God gave us this land ! Not even Silas can take it away ! DAVID : What 's going to happen to my brother ? ABNER : He committed treason . He saved Michelle . Which is why he lives to stand trial . Don 't talk to me anymore , David . Don 't talk to any of us . ( BOTH EXHALING ) Well ... Looks like someone 's ready for Judgment Day . FEMALE REPORTER : Quite a crowd gathered today at Unity Hall . Of the thousands of cases submitted , the committee has chosen just 1 0 . AII wait to hear the final decision . Judgment Day . A bigger crowd every year . Everyone wants an old-school lord and master cutting a few babies in half . Your health care suit ? Don 't get your hopes up . Just a warning . You work for the Ministry of Information . No good word for your sister ? Katrina Ghent isn 't interested in good words . She found the case dreary . Oh , right . Since when do you let anyone else 's opinion win out ? ( TRUMPETING ) ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) Since I started listening to him . Whereas we made law where there was none . We mined justice from sand . Whereas we have courts , civil and criminal , presided over by a tribunal of judges , who all apply good law with study , intelligence and compassion . In the case of State v. Ethan Shepherd , we have reviewed all evidence and are prepared to impart our decision . Will the Defense please come ? A system of appeals ensures justice decreed is justice deserved . And today , the Iast recourse . For those of you who feel themselves denied fair address of grievance , ten cases here selected . I alone will adjudicate . Divine wisdom my only counsel . And my gavel sound only after my words correct what is not right . Whereas ... Chancellor . ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) First case . Watson v. Colfair . ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) Second case . Milton v. the City of Arcadia . Ethan Shepherd , you know the severity of the charges . Your plea stands ? It does . Not guilty , Your Honor . Then , for the record , the charges against you . The Congregation of the Silent Prayer v. Reverend Ephraim Samuels . ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING ) Margolis v. Hopewell . Seven Sisters Brothel v. Carter . One count of fomenting dissent by means of physical violence . On two counts of reckless disregard for human life . One count of unlawful use of a firearm . And the tenth and final case ... The Township of Sela v. Nayar . ( GRUNTING ) And the final charge ... One count of high treason against the Crown of Gilboa . And on all charges we find the defendant , Ethan Shepherd , guilty . We will reconvene in 48 hours for sentencing . Tonight , we celebrate . And tomorrow , at eight bells , Judgment Day begins . ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) We have sacrificed too much already . Ethan , I 'II make a plea to the King . I swear , I 'II do anything I have to . I don 't need you . God will save me . Mom , I 'II fix this . Don 't worry . I will fix this . Ah ! Winston ? Ah ! Thank you . Make do with your egg whites . Eggs without yolks . Sacrilege . Prometheus on the rock gave better breakfast . David ? I can 't get through to your father . I 'II do anything . Judgment Day . Everyone waits on his schedule . My brother can 't wait . He 's being sentenced tomorrow . Look , I know Ethan let you be taken hostage . It may not put him in your favor , but I have to ask . I 'II do what I can . Believe me . I have to . You can 't let this stand . I don 't intend to . I 'm going to sneak a couple of these in my pocket . David 's brother has been found guilty . Rightly so . David will suffer for this . You have to weigh in . It 's Judgment Day . Why is David even a subject of conversation ? His family harbored a traitor . He should be exiled . Sir ? Five till . A full boardroom waits . I 'm due at the Ministry . I 'II walk with you . I need to clear my mind . Am I denied all pleasures this morning ? You 've had plenty . Try a spelt muffin . I 'd rather starve . Shepherd 's brother . We 'II find something . I hate Judgment Day . More mess every year . I Iike it . Each envelope contains a unit of hope . More envelopes , more hope . More envelopes , more hopes denied . Some of us hold on to hope . Boyden . KIotz . Wider path , please . The King approaches . You 're never going to tell her you love her . I will . When ? Tomorrow . End of Judgment Day . ( ALL CHEERING ) ( BANGS GAVEL ) Let 's judge . ( ALL LAUGHING ) The court calls Watson v. Colfair . Gentlemen , a matter of pig . Of hog , sir . Oh ! My stud hog 's services were appropriated without payment or consent . Well , your hog wandered onto my land . What was given , given naturally . How did I rule in the Iast case involving livestock ? Found for the cow , sir . ( ALL LAUGHING ) I feel the crux of this case can be made clear by its only witness . Chancellor , Iet me see the pig ... Hog . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) A case just dropped out of Judgment Day . We 'II need an alternate . Call my sister and offer her an audience . Perhaps I was too quick earlier denying her . Ah ! Generous and polite . I 'm lucky to have you for a boss . You have no idea . Just do as I say and when I say it , and we 'II both have our due . Yes , sir . Is Cook prepared for table tonight ? With a mind to the King 's satisfaction . Broiled salmon , tomatoes , capers , wine . Cook swears the cream won 't be missed . I applaud Cook 's optimism . Ah ! At last , on dessert . Andrew is allergic to eggs . Andrew ? Mmm-hmm . Cross ? I thought he was ... In exile ? He was . Back tonight . And my nephew will be welcomed to table by all . Yes , ma 'am . ( CLANKING ) Hello , Dad . Andrew . I didn 't hear you come in . Why didn 't you tell me you came ? I didn 't want to bother you . Welcome home , Son . Every man is entitled to pride of country and his livelihood . Medallion restored , as well as full ownership of said cab . ( ALL CHEERING ) Your own boss now , sir . Drive carefully . Thank you . Chancellor , you keep your King waiting on pork . Last word , approaching city limits . Well , moving forward . I 'm of a mind to judge . David Shepherd did request a moment . Oh , yes . The right time . Captain David Shepherd . ( ALL CHEERING ) Sir , I was hoping ... I submit to you Captain David Shepherd , a hero well-known . But unknown is his bravery in the crisis of Port Prosperity . ( SOFTLY ) I know . Your brother . But I cannot publicly overturn a court 's ruling on treason . ( SOFTLY ) Sir , I beg for clemency . Not even for your sake . But I will hear none speak ill of you for his . The Medal of Valor . Our highest order offered . Given four times ever . Now , five . His brother was convicted of treason , and Shepherd gets a medal . Mmm . Where do we stand with the new tenth case ? Your sister is set to present as we speak . I 'm due in chambers . Go . And keep Michelle talking . ( SIGHS ) It 's cruel . My father thinking a strip of tin will make up for your brother . He can 't show favor . He 's King . He can have cats called dogs if he wanted . But he doesn 't want to help you because he can 't intercede in a lower court decision without looking weak . But if the case were presented before him ... Called for Judgment Day , for example . How could that help ? That 's the whole reason for today . The kinder he is , the more they love him . If you can get your brother in there , my father can show the mercy we both know he feels . But it 's too late . I mean , the cases are already chosen . The Ministers are in session deliberating a new tenth case . Right now . Why should this come in as a tenth case ? We already have a system of health care . The system is anemic . Insurance companies refusing to fund treatment , at the expense of patients ' lives . Coverage must be compelled . There wasn 't supposed to be competition for the opening . She was the only other one who knew , but I assumed she knew about your brother . MICHELLE : ... the girl 's genetic predisposition . Any other country in the developed world would have ... I thought you wanted to help me . I do . You took my chance to present . Look , I 'm at your mercy . For my brother 's sake , I 'II ask . Withdraw your case so he can have a clear path . You can either help me or not . ( SNICKERS ) David and your sister at odds . Enough tarnishing for one day ? What 's the point of having power if you don 't use it ? The Congregation of the Silent Prayer v. Reverend Ephraim Samuels . Presenting for the Congregation is accountant Jane LIewellyn . Reverend Samuels embezzled a half a million of our congregation funds . Lost to unwise investment . His signature . Authorizing the transaction . I signed no such thing . It 's a forgery . ( SIGHS ) You 're the one person in the country no one thinks capable of stealing a cent . A sterling reputation in the balance . An unexpected dose of shame . Yet , this is your signature , exactly . Michelle , you withdrew our case ? What , after all that work to get heard ? What , David Shepherd waltzes in , and you shelve your ideals ? It was the right thing to do . Well , right or not , we 've been called to chambers . SILAS : So , you don 't remember signing this ? The day in question , it says here , you signed off on moving choir practice to Saturday nights . Yes . It was Wednesday nights . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) You signed the investment contract without reading it . A busy man has no time for fine print . I hope you 're not too stubborn to admit to human error . I may have signed , without knowledge . Miss LIewellyn , it was you who drafted the contract for the Reverend . Lost the funds yourself . Now looking to place blame . I hereby order you to stand trial for theft and misrepresentation . ( BANGS GAVEL ) We have read and weighed . The tenth position is awarded to Miss Michelle Benjamin . Benjamin v. Royal Crown of Gilboa , to be brought before the King tomorrow by close of day 's business . But I withdrew ... We invested time and effort into the review . Unless there is a change , your case holds the most merit . The Ministers need a reason . I 'II give them one . I 'II get Ethan to recant . David ... Turns out someone has been leaning hard on the prosecution to make an example of Ethan . They 're pushing for the death penalty . I thought you should know . I trust you were pleased with my ruling . Just and generous . I trust it was given without expectation of barter ? Ephraim . Is there something else that you wanted ? Why don 't you come to table this evening ? Too long since we 've shared a meal . We haven 't been on terms to break bread . I find myself in need of company . ( CLASSICAL GUITAR PLAYING ) Your coat , sir ? No , thank you . The mansion never changes . Aunt Rose will be happy to see you . I remember Aunt Rose . I know all will go well tonight , Andrew . Ah , lovely . Ah ! Andrew . William . We welcome the absent son of Shiloh . Welcome , Andrew returned home . Overdue . Come . Sit , sit , sit , sit . ROSE : please . SILAS : please . The Reverend Samuels is late . ROSE : He sent his regrets . I thought you knew . He seems content , William . Yes . I was thinking , perhaps , a position . Something at Unity Hall . Well , Iet him settle in . This time things will be different , I trust ? Don 't feel bad , Uncle . You did what you had to . Exile wasn 't so unpleasant . It was just ... Empty . Nothing but time . No one to talk to . Like you know how many nice things there are in life , and they 're all denied you . You know ? Hmm . Fish . I know . It 's always something lost . This time , a shoe . Don 't ask me how . Well done , by the way . Suffering through fish while we enjoyed roast . No snacking . Why did we pardon Andrew ? Do you ever listen to me when I speak ? Not when I get a better offer . Don 't say a word . Don 't move an inch . ( SCOFFS ) ( BOTH MOANING ) Haven 't you had your fill ? Never . You 're really quite something , you know . After all these years . Mmm-hmm . Perhaps deserving of a medal ? Oh , you really don 't like that boy . I Iike our own boy . You should , too . ( SHUSHING ) Enough of all that . Why don 't we just go to bed , and pretend that we have neither kids nor kingdoms to consider ? You have an early morning of judgment . ( SIGHS ) Well , I 'm not in the mood to judge . Well , justice is indifferent to your moods . Oh , as is my own wife , apparently . ETHAN : After all I 've done , to recant now ? The King can 't forgive you if you don 't . ETHAN : I don 't want his forgiveness . I want him to change his mind . He won 't on the land . But he might on you . If you give him a reason . Don 't you understand , Ethan ? I stood up to the King for what I believe . Why would I want to live a life that 's saved by a lie ? As much as you believe in Silas , I know that he 's wrong . I know that he 's not the one in God 's heart . I don 't even know if there is a God . But I know that we can change things . You and I. We 're the ones here . We 're the ones who can save you . Can 't you see , David ? I 'm already saved . What 's this ? I 'm hungry . You need to help David . His brother won 't recant . You know how badly this could go . I tried . Who do you think suggested he present his case in the first place ? Yeah , well , he won 't have a chance unless you convince Katrina to vote his way . I know you , Jack . You don 't let other people tell you what to do . You give the orders . I 'm just a humble civil servant . ( SCOFFS ) You 're lying . You 're calling the shots at Information . You choreographed David 's entire situation . You 'd let his brother die for jealousy ? What ? One too many magazine covers cut ... I 'm not jealous . He can have all the magazine covers he wants . Then why ruin him ? Risk someone dying . To save myself ! Don 't you get it ? I 'm fighting for my right to exist ! Whose life is more secure than yours ? You 're the Prince . And you 're the Princess . Born first by four minutes . eldest by a hair . Are you really that innocent ? That you haven 't thought about it yourself ? Or are you just too ashamed to admit you have ? No one wants your crown . Not yet . You can 't produce an heir . So , what ? You could still take pride of place . I see the way you look at Shepherd . I see the way your father looks at him . AII it takes is one wedding and he can make of the pair of you a king and queen . And me ? Suddenly , the court jester . I will not sit by and be plowed into obscurity by someone else 's ambition . Not after all I sacrificed . What do you want me to do ? Swear to never see David again ? AII you have to do is tell Shepherd to take what 's offered . Landlady let me in . Benefits of being a princess . I have a message from Katrina Ghent . A way to save your brother . Katrina carries influence with the judges on your brother 's case . She 's willing to wield it to lighten his sentence . What could she possibly want from me ? Your next press briefing . ( CLEARS THROAT ) She wants you to denounce my father . Say that he 's wrong on Port Prosperity . Tell the world that he 's lost his way and he 's not fit to lead us . Why would she want that ? She knows it would hurt him , coming from you . ( CHUCKLES ) So , this is how it really works . If Ethan won 't save himself , you have to . To save my brother , I 'm supposed to go against my King . If I make that choice , I 'II never see you again . Wait , I 'm sorry , I can 't . ( DOOR CLOSING ) Oh , yeah . Tender . Are you finished with that ? Hmm . Oh , good . Mmm . Is this my last meal , then ? Before execution ? Goodness . It 's not my birthday , is it ? By my count , I 've over a week . Four months ago . I don 't need occasion to extend courtesy to a prisoner . Oh , dear . The King is bored . I felt that gloom . I 'd rape a serving girl . So sure of yourself . I 've got nothing to do . I think a Iot about you . There 's clarity in solitude . Do you think I don 't see loneliness when it 's eating in front of me ? You 're a king . And every second you aren 't miserable is a second stolen . It 's a Iong time since you 've been a king . Our lives , not much different . Though I somehow make do without self-pity . Watch yourself . You expect to rule the world and be happy ? Being a king is a terrible job . Joyless . No comfort or heat . No silky lover who wants nothing back . You 'd sooner find the ark as a true friend . God won 't allow it . You still try , and he mocks you for it . What did I ever do to God ? You asked to be King . Macaroon ? MALE ANNOUNCER : The public fully supports King Silas ' authority , and this is the most controversial case of Judgment Day ... Next case . Township of Sela v. Nayar . Dr. Nayar has turned himself in for a drunk driving , hit-and-run fatality committed ten years ago . Authorities are looking to press full charges . Sir , I have struggled with the guilt of my mistake since I was a young man . I have spent the past 1 0 years working as a doctor . I know the lives I 've saved can never take the place of the one I took , but I believe that my time would be better spent in the community . We have a character witness in support of the Defense . Helen Pardis . I am here on account of my son , Seth . Dr. Nayar has saved his life countless times , and his kindness and caring are second only to the boy 's father , whose visits have been less frequent of late . He works . Is your son well at the present time ? Yes , thanks to his doctor . And the hope of better days . You 're asking me to forgive a fatal crime to soothe one boy . HELEN : Dr. Nayar has provided my son with a presence of stability , safety ... Of strength . A strength my son needs to stay alive . You are acting as God today , sir . I ask you . How much more can God demand ? I 'm sure Dr. Nayar deserves gratitude . As much as it will cause pain , I must do what God and law require . I order the Doctor to be returned to prison to serve full sentence for wrongful death , as applicable by law . Next case . I 'm not supposed to use this as a place to talk about personal things , but I find I have to . This is the first time I 've experienced how justice really works . Live , not on TV . I see now how lucky we are to have a King who knows the difference between what is right and what is expedient . Who understands the sacrifices that must be made in order to pursue the true course . So that we ... So that I can learn from him . Call the Judge . David 's brother gets the full penalty . You tell him that 's from me . I tried , but I can 't . Manipulating the system , dirty justice ... I can 't speak against him . I don 't want this . I don 't deserve it . They 're sentencing Ethan . I should be with him . They 're ready for us in the boardroom . And I have a feeling this could be it for us . No good reason . Just a feeling . I don 't think I can . You should present . After everything you 've done to get this here ? David Shepherd . When you wanted to withdraw this case before , you said it was the moral choice . It was . You did it for him . Is that it , then ? You 're in love with him ? Hey , don 't deny it on my account . I 'm not scared of a Iittle competition . Well , look . I 'II see you inside . Andrew ! I 'm home . Hello ? JUDGE : The court will rise . Ethan Shepherd , you have been found guilty of the high crime of treason against the Crown . This Court accordingly sentences you to death . Sentence to be carried out on the gallows , dawn , tomorrow . ( INAUDIBLE ) Granted . Your health care bill turned court case now made law . ( ALL CHEERING ) Well , after so many petitions for the same , is this the extent of jubilation ? Other things weigh on the mind . Indeed . HANSON : Ladies and gentlemen , this is the conclusion of Judgment Day . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) You 're missing the festivities . His brother will die in the morning , thanks to you . Thanks to us . David didn 't do it . Why ? Because he actually believes in my father . Even without him denouncing the King and with his brother 's head on the chop , he won 't stay . Either way , I 'm rid of him . Only at the cost of tar on your soul . Don 't you worry about my immortal soul . It 's been starved . Maybe you want to feed it . Or lecture me sternly somewhere private . ( SCOFFS ) You , of all people , judging me ? Well ... That can 't feel good , when someone like me won 't even have you . BOYDEN : End of Judgment Day . Finally get to clean up . BOYDEN : End of Judgment Day . You didn 't tell her . KLOTZ : I know . BOYDEN : You 're never going to tell her . KLOTZ : I know . You have business here , take it up with my son . I only came to return something the King might be looking for . I came here greedy for all the trappings position could provide . Someone here had all that and turned it down . Your friend . Time to bed , sir . Time to , Stu . Not on rounds ? It 's the end of my shift , sir . Long day after watching you . Doesn 't have to be over . It 's good to know I have someone I can trust . ( CAR LOCKS ) Captain Shepherd . You came when called , under these circumstances . I failed my family . Not much to be done at home . Nothing more required . Your brother is being moved . Moved ? To a minimum security facility in Vital , where he will serve , in full , a six-month sentence , if he can learn from his newfound remorse and keep his mouth shut . You did this ? Not for favor . I am justice , impartial . Not blind . But when a court sentences in such an extreme , it validates the Sovereign 's right of oversight . You 'II be wanting to tell the family . plan a visit . I wasn 't sure about God . Or how he deals with any of us . Now , I see . God works through you . I Iove you , too , Mom . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) I 'II see you tonight . I can 't wait . Bye . Hey , come on in . Good news about your brother . I 'm sorry there wasn 't more that I could do when ... It 's fine . I know you tried . I owe you something . The truth . About us . You and I , we keep finding ourselves in these moments where we look at each other and we both know what 's supposed to come next . And then , I run . I didn 't know you felt the same . I did . I ... I do . The same . I felt ridiculous for even thinking ... You 're not ridiculous . You 're in my heart . But I can 't , David . Not ever . I don 't understand . If you want to ... I 'm sorry . I swore . I 'm promised to someone else . I 'm sorry .

 Previously on Heroes There were 12 of us . Now ... there are 9 . Who wants revenge , Mrs. Petrelli ? I want my lawyer now . Where is she ? It 's gonna be all right , ma . So you can find anyone in the world ? You just need to think about them ? There 's only one that i can 't . When i think about him , he can see me . Everything that i had , it 's gone . Wait . Take me with you . I have a car . I 'll only be gone for a while . And you 're gonna be staying with family . It could be fun . Okay , fine . I 'm a freak , all right ? Claire , shut up . What 's on your neck ? Last thing i remember , this man stepping out of the bushes calling my name . What are you talking about ? What man ? The guy with the horn-rimmed glasses . I 'm sending you a jpeg of a painting i found . It 's the last in the series . Eight of eight . Mr. Muggles and i just did two whole miles at the beach . You wouldn 't know it looking at him , but this dog can power walk . Have you talked to claire lately ? About what ? Oh , just about how she 's adjusting . Has she met somebody ? A boy maybe ? If the wrong person comes into her life , it could be ... problematic for all of us . What makes you so sure it 's a boy ? What makes you so sure it isn 't ? Is there something on my face ? Claire , your mother and i need to talk to you ... about boys . Oh , please , not the sex talk again . It was painful enough the first time . We just want to know if you 're seeing anyone . Why , because dating is forbidden too ? Along with cheerleading and a social life ? Nobody 's forbidding anything , claire . It 's just that any outsider could be a threat to the family . Dad , believe it or not , there are people in this world who aren 't out to get us . All we 're saying is if there is a boy , i 'd like to meet him . We could help you decide whether this is somebody that you could trust . Dad , relax . Okay , there 's no boy . Okay , it 's okay . I 'm sorry , i can 't help it . It just keeps on happening . I 'm sorry . Shh . It 's okay . Get the light . Oh , honey . Molly . She 's fine , she 's fine . Okay , put your head down . It 's over right ? Okay . You want something to drink ? Water . Water , okay . It 's getting worse . Two a night now . I 'm trying to listen in . Get in her head . And i keep getting thrown back . So what are we supposed to do ? I don 't know . You 're the scientist . That doesn 't exactly make me an expert on nightmares . That makes two of us . I don 't know . I 'll go get the water . Just keep her calm . And we 'll just ... figure it out , right ? Just try to get some sleep , sweetheart . When will they stop ? I don 't know . Come on , kids , let 's go . Monty ! Simon ! - Dad ! - Dad ! Dad ! Hey , boys . You grew a beard . You like it ? No ? You want me to shave it ? Listen , i wanted to tell you that your grandmother is in the hospital . Is she okay ? Yeah , she 's gonna be fine . When you get home , i want you to get your mommy to help you call her , okay ? Because i know she 's gonna want to hear from you . Okay . I know i haven 't been around . And i 'm sorry about that . But i 'm coming home . I promise . And what do Petrellis do when they makes promises ? Keep them ! That 's right . Can i help you ? I 'm their father . You know you 're not allowed to be here . Go ahead . No , i want to stay with you . It 's okay . Go on . See you soon , okay ? Mm-hmm . Go ahead . So ... you are from California ? California ? Uh-huh . The license on the car . It says " California " . Oh , that . No , i just picked the car up there . I 'm actually from Jersey . This is very , very close to New York . We are going to New York , my brother and me . Look , i can take you guys pretty far , but when we get to the border , chances are they 're gonna be looking for all of us . Dude looks dead . Help me ... Heroes Season 02 Episode 04 " The Kindness of Strangers " Micah ! Wake up , fool ! Morning , boys . You ready for school ? Yes , ma 'am . Yes , ma 'am . You watch your tongue , young man . He 's a guest in our house . We 'll see about that . Nana , i need $ 65 . That 's funny . So do i . Good morning , everybody ! Well , do i look any different today ? Just as lame as you always do . You look confident . Confident 's good . How about in charge ? Micah ? Yeah , you look like someone who 's in charge . And why do i look like someone who is in charge ? Because somebody died and left you that way ? No , because today is the day they 're posting the test results for the Regional Manager training program . The test i just happened to have aced . Right . Good , so now you can afford that $ 65 i asked you for . No , i can 't . And don 't be asking grandma either . Don 't give him a dime , Nana . He wants it for some wrestling match on pay-per-view tonight . Half the people in this county are living in fema trailers , and you want to spend good money to watch grown men jump around in their underwear . You can walk down Bourbon street for that . But it 's the night of the tag team title . I can 't miss it . You should be watching something educational like this . This is good tv . And voila , you have a beautiful tomato rose . Making flowers out of tomatoes ? Who 's got time to do that ? Unfortunately , i do . And you have a recipe to impress . I 'll bring dinner home from the restaurant . - Mwah ! - Again ? Wish me luck . Break a leg . Whatever . What you lookin ' at ? Nothing . It 's just i think i know a way to get you pay-per-view . I did it . I killed Kaito Nakamura . Why ? For all the reasons you said . - Sex ? Money ? - Yes . You know i was on the roof . You have my fingerprints . I did it . I pushed him off . When we , uh , we brought you in , you tried to kill yourself . Turns out your wounds were self-inflicted . I was distraught . Overwhelmed by what i did . And so I ... i attacked myself . Write down the statement and let it go , Parkman . Please let it go . Ahem . Uh ... Mrs. Petrelli , why are you doing this ? My head is clear now . I understand . The only way out of this is for me to confess . Fine . I 'll start the paperwork . If they keep digging , they will find out about all of us and what we can do . Let it go . What 's that ? Parental release form to try out for the cheerleading squad . For me ? Yep . I 'm flattered . I don 't think i can squeeze cheerleading into my schedule . But you 're kind of a hero to the girls in the squad . A hero ? Why ? The way you stood up to Debbie on your first day . You know , half of being a cheerleader is having guts . And you have got those in spades . I 'll tell you what . I 'll think about it , and then i 'll let you know if i change my mind . Good ! Then take the release form , just in case . Hi . Hi . I can 't stop thinking about yesterday . It was so amazing . I finally have someone i can be myself with . Uh , about that . I ... i 'm not sure we should hang out anymore . It 's just my parents are really overprotective . Is this because we flew together ? - I weirded you out , didn 't i ? - No ! I like you , i really do . Then it 's those marks on my neck , right ? You think i was abducted by aliens . I told you , it was a guy with horn-rimmed glasses . It 's my dad . He 's just really overprotective about the dating thing . Then let me talk to him . I don 't think that 's a good idea . But ... i can fly . And you can regenerate . I mean , doesn 't that tell you anything ? Please don 't make this harder on me than it already is . Okay . I 'll tell you what . Tomorrow i 'll totally back off . Today , i 'm asking you out . - West ... I ... - Tonight , anywhere you want to go . If you want to call it off after that , fine . Fine , but just this once . You won 't regret it . What do you think you 're doing questioning a suspect in a hospital ? - Any confession is coerced . - She 's sick . Coerced or not , they believe her . But i know she 's innocent . How ? The same way i know that you can fly . I can read your mind . Just like i read your mother 's . But i can 't tell my partner what i know or how i know it . You reading my mind right now ? No ... yes , sorry . Look , your mother thinks she 's protecting somebody by shutting down this investigation . But i 'm not gonna let it happen . I 'm not backing down . I 've got a little girl at home that wakes up in the middle of the night screaming about nightmares , and drawing a symbol that ... this . The same symbol that 's on these photos . I know that symbol . I think it 's all connected . Everything . What you and i can do . We 're all connected . I know this photograph . Good , because i need your help . I can 't continue this investigation without you . All right , i 'll help . I need five minutes alone with my mother . Alone . Why are you confessing to a crime you didn 't commit ? Because you were right , Nathan . I don 't deserve to be saved . Ma , i was angry when i said that . I was drunk . I didn 't mean it . Of course you did . You asked me for help once . Now just let me help you . Just because you shaved doesn 't mean you 're clean and sober . You still have to get yourself into a program . Get your family back . Don 't let your children hate you . Not if you can help it . You didn 't kill Kaito Nakamura . I know that . I have done so many bad things in my life it really doesn 't matter what crime i confess to . Let me help you , ma . No , what you want is redemption , and you 're not gonna get it by helping me . You 'll just get killed . And i can 't bear to lose another son . Ahem . He has to do this . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . I 'm ... i 'm ready . Where 's your stuff ? You 're traveling pretty light . I got robbed . Been walking for three days . Thank god you came along . Where are you going ? Going home to America . New York . New York . This is where we 're going . Do you have family there ? No . Uh ... we need to find this man . Maya , no . Dr. Suresh . This is a coincidence . I know this book . I 've read it . Really ? Why are you searching for Dr. Suresh ? For a ... how you say this ? - Answers . - To what ? I know Dr. Suresh . We 're old friends . You and Dr. Suresh ? You 've helped me . Now i can return the favor . I can ... i can take you to him . I can help you find him . Thank you . I don 't know what to say . I don 't even know your name . It 's Gabriel . Gabriel Gray . Gabriel . Oh ! Like the angel . Yeah . Just like the angel . * i spent oh so many nights * * just feeling sorry for myself * * i used to cry ... mm mm * * but now i hold my head up high ... * We 've got rules against drinking on the job , you know . It 's all about attitude , Camille . - What 's about attitude ? - Life . And today is the first day of the rest of mine . Uh-huh , you sound like a fortune cookie . No , i sound like a woman with a future . Is there something you 're not telling me ? I took the test . Oh , are you pregnant ? No ! Girl , now how am i gonna be pregnant wearing this outfit two shifts a day ? The management training program . I took the test . Oh , that . What do you mean " Oh , that " ? Nothing . I just think that you shouldn 't get your hopes up , that 's all . Only a fool would put money on a 1 in 50 chance . Look , if i make manager , i can earn enough money to go back to school , get my degree . I can move my family out of here . It 's not right . One storm comes rolling through here and blows away my whole life . My mother . My college education . My dreams . I 'm sorry . It 's just you 've been talking like this since we were in kindergarten . One scheme after another , and nothing every happens . What in the world ? Where did you learn to do that ? I don 't ... Monica , let me talk to you for a second . Okay . I 'm sorry , Monica . You 're just not qualified for the management program . So i didn 't do well on the test ? You did fine . Not top tier , but ... but what ? I 'm motivated . I 'm hard working . Mr. Lamont , i 've never missed a day . That 's not the issue . A management position means you need to be available for any location in the state . And it 's just not right for someone in your situation . My situation ? Your home life . Your brother , your grandmother . That 's the point . I 'm the breadwinner . I need the money . And i mean , i can 't make hamburgers for the rest of my life . You 're good at your job , Monica . What 's wrong with that ? And you should be happy you have one . There 's a lot of people in this city who don 't . I thought for dessert we could go to that adorable yogurt place near the bus depot . I can 't . I have to go to the library for a research paper . The library ? Haven 't you ever heard of the internet ? Actually , the research paper is on libraries and how during the digital age they 're becoming increasingly obsolete for our generation . Do you need a lift ? What ? Your car ? It got stolen , remember ? So do you ? That 's okay . I think i 'm just gonna walk . Okay . Hi . Hi Photo 's gotta be in here somewhere . It 's a group shot . Maybe 10 , 12 people . What kind of group is it ? It was a party or a meeting . My parents are in it . Kaito Nakamura . You knew Nakamura ? No , my folks did . He used to come over the house sometimes . My father didn 't seem to care for him too much . I remember the last time i saw him , my mom hugged him , and it lasted just a little bit too long . What about the others in the group ? Linderman was in it . Charles Deveaux too . A lot of them are dead now . These your boys ? Yeah . What , you don 't see ' em that often ? Look , i don 't ... i 'm sorry , i don 't really know you that well . My wife ... my ex-wife , uh , cheated on me . Which i could 've forgiven her for , except for the fact that she was pregnant with his baby . Why are you telling me all this ? I just ... i know a bunch of stuff about you . I figure it 's only fair . If you want to unload , go ahead . Six months ago , i was a cop in L.A. Married , expecting a child , and then all of a sudden this stuff started happening . It just turned everything upside down . I 'm just looking for answers . Maybe this 'll help . That 's the same photo . Half the people in this picture are dead . It 's the like killer 's picking ' em off one by one . Maybe one of these is the killer . Look , here 's my father , here 's my mother . Charles deveaux . Linderman . Kaito nakamura . This guy 's name is Bob . Bob ... i don 't know his last name . I don 't know the rest of the people in the picture either . I know him . How ? That 's my father . Hey . Ugh . Making hamburgers ? Is he kidding me ? I swear , i 'd like to smack him upside his head . I 'm glad you didn 't . You can 't afford to get fired . I can 't explain it , but i know i 'm supposed to be somebody . I feel like there 's something inside me that wants to come out . Does that make any sense ? You lost more than most in the storm , and that kind of loss , it takes a while . You shouldn 't be in such a hurry . I don 't know . Maybe god 's punishing me . Now why would he do that ? For being selfish . I pray for it every Sunday in church . For god to find me a way out of here . Everybody else is praying for the community . To put things back together , to give them strength . Not me . I 'm just praying for a way out . That 's terrible , isn 't it ? Monica , given the situation , i 'd say it 's pretty normal . Normal . Yeah , that 's me all right . I offer to take you anywhere , and this is all you can come up with ? Well , what can i say ? I 'm a cheap date . You got a thing for heights , huh ? There was this place near where i used to live in Texas . It was this old gravel tower . I used to climb up to the top of it . See what i could do . You 'd jump off ? Yeah . Guess i 've just been thinking a lot about my life . How it all went away so fast . Why did it go away ? I can 't tell you that . The truth is so many terrible things happened to me while i lived there ... i 'm not sure i could ever open up to anyone again . Well , we 're here together . So part of you must want to share something . I want to trust you . Then jump . What ? - Trust begins with a leap . - Oh ! Cheesy , but true . Oh , no , it 'll be gross . My arms pop out of their sockets and sometimes my feet come out facing each other . It 's ... it 's not cute . Claire , these fears you have of someone finding out about you , of feeling different forever , i have them too . You can share them with me , but i can 't help you if you don 't trust me . Okay . You caught me . Of course i did . But i would 've been fine . I know you can heal , Claire . But i never want to see you hurt . I don 't understand . You don 't even have tools . Just hold on . Almost got it . You know if this doesn 't work , you 're dead . You know that , right ? Wow , you did it ! All right , you got your stay of execution . Is that Pay-Per-View ? Uh-huh . How did you get that ? Turns out Micah 's some type of genius and rigged the cable . Is that true ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . I was just trying to help . Look , i know it 's tough being stuck with your cousins like this after everything you 've been through . But i promised your mother that i 'd look after you . So you gotta obey the rules around here , okay ? I know . I , uh , i got dinner for you guys . You can eat in front of the tv . Hey , you okay ? Yeah . I just wish i could fix your dreams for you . You 're a sweet kid . Go tell Damon dinner 's ready . Dinner 's ready . Yeah , in a minute . Here goes a 619 . That 's awesome . Matt , you 're home ! Hey , yeah ! I 'm home . Oh , and i need to talk to you . Uh , both of you , actually . Is everything okay ? Yeah , yeah , i , um ... i have to find my father . You don 't know where your dad is ? He left me when i was 13 . He gave me 120 bucks and a pat on the head . And you haven 't seen him since ? I 've tried , but that 's the thing about criminals . They ... they don 't like to be found . He 's a bad guy ? My dad stole a lot of money from a lot of people . And the case that i 'm working on right now , i have a feeling that he 's in the middle of something really dangerous , and i need to talk him . So i need you to help me find him . - Okay ? - Okay . All right , good . There he is . That 's my dad . - Molly , what is it ? - Molly , what 's wrong ? Put it away ! Put it away ! - Molly . - Molly , what 's wrong ? Please don 't make me look for him . Please don 't make me look . I don 't understand . Why not ? He 's the man in my dreams . He is the nightmare man . I 'm gonna make things right , Pete . Get away from me ! Oh , my gosh , look what time it is . My dad 's gonna kill me . What lie did you use to get out of the house ? 'Cause i 'm guessing you didn 't say you were flying around in the arms of some kid from school . I said i was going to the library . Ouch . I 'm sure he didn 't suspect a thing . I 'm sorry , i 'm a lousy liar . Look ... if we 're gonna keep seeing each other , you 've gotta come up with something good . Something consistent . Like what ? I 'm volunteering at a soup kitchen . Claire , the credible lies are the ones that make you look bad . What else is it that your dad doesn 't want you to do ? I think i have just the thing . Aren 't you gonna say good night ? You 're killing me . Gabriel . Come here . Check this out . There are killers in the car with us . What ? " Homocidio . " Right there . Well , golly , they seem so ... Dude , i have been riding with them for two days . We gotta ditch ' em . Okay , um ... all right , i 'll distract them . And you ... you go call the police . There 's a payphone right inside . We have a problem . I 'm gonna ask you a question , and you need to tell me the truth . What is it ? This . Is this you ? Yes , this is us , but it is not our fault . We didn 't mean to hurt anyone . Well , you can tell the police that , because Derek is calling them right now . No , no , no , please , no ! He cannot ! Maya ! What are you doing to me ? You both ... have power . This is not our fault . We don 't know what 's happening to us . That 's why you need to find Dr. Suresh . Yes . Believe me , i understand what you 're going through . To be held responsible for things that you didn 't mean to do . Being hunted . I 've helped Suresh with so many people like you . He 'll know what to do . But the police . They have to catch us first . How was the library ? Dad , i can explain . You don 't need to . You were with a boy . No , no , there 's no boy . Okay . So ... i 'm waiting . I tried out for cheerleading . Cheerleading ? I made the squad . I forged your signature on the release form . The girls took me out to celebrate . You ... first you get your car stolen , now ... I - i told you no cheerleading . I was very specific about that . Dad , cheerleading makes me happy , okay ? Look , i know , it 's scary and i know there are risks . Just please let me have this one thing . I 've done everything else you 've asked me to . I 've given up my friends and my life . I just need one thing that 's normal . I had no idea that cheerleading meant that much to you . Took me by surprise too . You 're gonna let me do it ? I 'll make you a deal . You cheerlead , but you promise me that you will not date for now . Okay . Okay . I have a lead on the paintings . We have to go to Odessa . Texas . The Ukraine . It 's a long trip . What will you tell your family ? Oh , i 'm sure i 'll think of something . She 's finally settling down . I 'm sorry . You didn 't know . No , i 'm sorry , because ... Molly has to find my father . That is out of the question . A lot of people in this photo are dead . This guy , dead . This guy , dead . Kaito Nakamura , murdered . Angela Petrelli , attacked . This is my dad . He may already be dead . He be the next victim . He may be the killer . I have to find that out . Look , this man here ? This is the man i work for . His name is Bob . I 'll take you to him . Fine . After we find my dad . You leave Molly out of this ! You 're asking a little girl to confront her worst nightmare ! Maybe confronting it is exactly what she needs . Oh , so this is all about helping Molly ? Because to me it sounds like a 13-year-old boy trying to make his daddy pay for leaving him . And you know everything about daddy issues . Yeah , i do . I 'll do it for you , Matt . I 'll find your father . Thank you . Monica , it 's dead tonight . Let 's close up . You get the front door . I 'll get the back . Sure . Sorry , we 're closed . But the sign say y 'all close at 10 : 00 . Look , i 'm hungry . My boss , he 's making me close up for the night . And i said i 'm hungry . And while you 're at it , i 'll take everything you got in the register ! Okay okay Sit down right there ! Did you just see ... Where 'd you learn that ? On tv . We 're right here for you . Yeah , we 're gonna protect you . I see a city . Philadelphia . Good . - An apartment building . - What floor ? I don 't want to go in . He can 't hurt you . It 's okay . - Third floor . - Okay , good . Good , what 's the apartment number ? He knows i 'm here . He 's coming . - Okay , Molly , what 's the apartment number ? - Quickly , come on . Nine . Nine , good girl . All right , get out of there right now . He sees me , he ... leave me alone ! Molly , get out of there ! Leave me alone ! Molly , Molly ! Matt . - Molly ? - Molly ! She 's breathing . What happened ? She 's in shock . She won 't wake up . Come on , Molly , you did it . Molly , it 's time to get up ! - Come on , wake up ! - Matt , don 't . Don 't . Matt , help me ! Matt !

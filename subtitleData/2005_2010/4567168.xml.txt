 First cold . Then pain . Birth pain . Then I realized my energy cell was running out unusually fast . So fast that there was only time enough for my short life to flash in front of my eyes . EDIT AND I I keep my fingers crossed . Broni Belgrade . May 20th 2074 dawned on us . what is a morning drizzle compared to yesterday 's cloudburst . However ... Belgrade 's Weather Bureau informs us 4F . humidity 75 percent . blue and healthy and these are some modern Mays . like any other ... it 's a pity we are losing so much beautiful weather ' . ' Miss Stefanovic . too . Next ! Don 't say you 're crying because of the exam . - Otomo has died . No ... How ? He picked up some radio virus . Just started singing some Arabic song and then fell . Just like bots in my brother 's company . and I could only go to bot-graveyard and bury him . You didn 't ? You are sick ... Even weather was right for my little morbid excursion . I even made a little gravestone . OTOMO Everyone said you weren 't alive They are finally right This one rules . - I knew you 'd like it . Look at this one . - And you get this for only 30 dinars ? this is for real players . 50 dinars . - Listen Woo ... I have nothing against plastic but sometimes you have to make out with some real meat . she 's not a bitch in her PMS . And leaves huge emptiness when you come . That 's if you 're a romantic fool that wastes energy on emotions . this is like electrical massager . when you can listen to a dynamic recording on a disc ? - Mostly guys that are not screwing plastic dolls . - Speaking of dolls ... You can tell she has aced it . Look how cheerful she is . too ? You obviously don 't know me . This is a real challenge for me . I can always tease her about the exam . I won 't join you two in that exercise . - Why ? It is too stressed for someone used to a partner that only tells him she loves him and he 's the best in you know what . Bye . - Bye . Promise not to make me laugh and I 'll drive you home . you should know Otomo has died . Then I suggest we go silently to your place and then to our separate ways without unnecessary intimacy . Great plan . You thought of it all by yourself ? my dear . you told me you 'd ask grandpa for money today . You should never trust a bear that smokes filterless ' Drina ' . you don 't trust me ? could you give me your social security number ? Give you what ? - Social security number . For the exam and all . - God ! This robo-rabbit of hers is asking for my social security number to sign up for the exam . She has flunked it again . When I ask her how it was she 'll say she aced it ! I would be the only human in line to sign up for the exam . How did she turn out to be such a liar ? - Like Tarzan . will steal ... She 'll end up in prison . this morning they caught your ex again stealing high voltage tablets . My former husband is an artist of a French origin . What do these electro-workers know ? too . - That doesn 't count . What is one failed exam compared to the avalanche of knowledge she is ready to tackle . - Avalanche ! Give money to the rabbit to pay for her exam . You don 't talk about your new job . - TDR ? Not bad . I think that I got in because grandpa although he says he didn 't . I don 't really know what my job is . But they are pleased have communication skills and that I am good looking . - Good looking ? What are you doing there ? - Taking care of an autistic boy . we talk ... I talk . He never does . We take a walk in the park and I try to reach him ... Make him say something . - Like what ? - I don 't know . They just told me that he is a mathematical prodigy . I just hope that he is not that confused to ask you to extract his pants . - I knew it . I should have taken a bus . I 'm home ! honey . How was it ? - I passed . You passed ... And what about grade ? - I 've got a B. - B ... You fatherfucking liar ! Don 't think I don 't know you didn 't pass the exam ! At least learn to lie ! Am I feeding you for that ? And providing for you so that you can fool around ? I told you . You should have asked him . Of course you didn 't pass the fucking exam when you are honey ... you say ? Wait ... Why is the image like this ? They can 't ruin my show . Today 's episode is important . our love is finally free . there is something you must know ... I am a robot . My heart is made of metal . I also have a confession to make ... I don 't even have a heart . Pedro ... - Maria ... honey . Teddy ... Please pick up these posters so that we don 't tread on them . But your posters ' tube is not here . That idiot Bojan hasn 't returned it yet . it is like this ... - Now we are on a look doc basis ! we 'll stay there . You shouldn 't get too intimate with me . You are not really my type . - Young man ... whose boundaries you couldn 't even imagine . - Listen doc ... Can you imagine boundaries of Meta Group 's funds ? it is not that complicated . they squeeze me and I squeeze you . That 's a lot of squeezing . Like the prom night . Until someone gives in . - I still think this thing is between the Meta Group and me . - The thing between you and the Group is called Sergey and you 're looking at him . but not for long . They need something solid . Tell them that this time we have concrete plan . will ... - Edit Stefanovic ? - New intern . I think she will be able to reach Abel . She has all relevant qualities . has excellent knowledge of psychology and she 's capable of split second reactions . What are you doing ? you better use it . Just stroke his monkey and one exam less . am I right ? You 'd do a little muff diving to pass an exam ? - Naturally . the line of least resistance . - Thanks . Higher education reform should be based on your method . Oral educational method ... It would be interesting to be a professor . Will you come to pick this up ? - I intended to . but it 's more so than the oral method . Oral morals ... I 'll drive you to Herb and go home . I have work to do . - You are still writing the book ? That is my therapy . I 'll do it for the rest of my life . Does that mean that one day I will be with a rich writer ? Or with a serial killer . Don 't forget the initial capital letter in sentence . I 'm glad to see you are better . - That 's two of us . exhale and that is it . and ... hold it for three seconds and exhale ! inhale ... How long should I hold ? Hold your breath for five minutes . Maybe you 'll survive . Scram . Next customer . Damn technology . What was wrong with swallow it . Hi . - Hi . - Bye . three . Take off your clothes . Implanting is five more dinars or you could go and wait at the public ambulance . - Ok . Hit me ! Why the fuck are you screaming ? - You said it wouldn 't hurt ! It wouldn 't if you drank brandy . She is bleeding all over your carpet . - Fuck ! Chip searches and automatically recognizes the nerve by the structure of its impulses and then presto ! it has even automatically bandaged your arm . What now ? - That 's it . - That 's it ? Read this small paragraph here . And then his large penis ... What 's this ? - Keep reading . man ... What do you mean gone ? I gave you the whole damn bong ! There were just four hits . - What do you mean four ? There was a whole corn . Where did all this fog come from ? I 'll make more . - I don 't have more . I am Weissmuller . I haven 't told you to read the whole thing . Now ... What is the 24th letter that you have read ? How should I know ? Ryto remember . E ! - E ... one 'd think you 're really enjoying it . are you ? Your pupils are moving pretty fast . What are you counting ? You won 't tell me ? I probably wouldn 't understand . My head is full with modulars and modular models . Whole next month I 'll be stupid for everything else . Don 't answer it ! - You speak ... What did you just say ? Say it . Abel has spoken . - What ? right now ! it seemed like he knew that phone was about to ring . and wanted to warn me . professor ? You owe me an explanation . follow me . what is this ? what we are doing here is a state secret . Abel Mustafov was a mathematical prodigy that has made the greatest breakthrough ever in universal theory research . That is theory that defines interconnectedness of all energies found on earth . Experts have been trying to find this formula for centuries . It 's believed to be the formula of the all-encompassing energy . Direct line to God . One day something happened to Abel . We believe that he has figured it out . But what does happen to a man that discovers fundamental truths about life and universe ? He becomes autistic and disinterested . Based on his notes we managed to reconstruct part of the formula . We also used research methods used on unborn babies . we got the graph of this formula . but we don 't know how it works . What you saw upstairs is not a coffee machine . It 's one of the most powerful computers in the world . It is useless with these calculations . An incredible phenomenon occurs during calculations . Computing software falls into what we call 'algorithm absurd ' . and then it simply shuts down . This is why we need to communicate with Abel . You said that Abel could see future . That is also true . based on parameters all the points on the graph one image is worth a thousand words . You 'll see the graph its spatial coordinates and temporal function are in mass and color as an audio function . You must see it in a special neuro-perceptive technique . I don 't have to tell you that everything to ensure our safety . That was a picture impossible to draw . shimmering lines that trick the eye and form various shapes that seem familiar but you don 't know where from . I don 't know ... you jerk ! I 'll call my children ! Let me go ! and you say that happened to whom ? I felt so stupid . She didn 't understand how important that was for me . Why didn 't you tell that to someone else ? - I did ... That 's just like my new earrings ... now you don 't . now you don 't . but you 'll feel the same if you take two opis . That is the worst excuse for not having sex ever . Don 't you understand I stood in front of it weeping with joy ? Come here and you 'll also weep with joy . - Stupid prick ! I have to study ! how could you do that ? Meta Group would understand ! - Understand what ? That a broad is wandering around city telling everybody what is going on in a state company that should be conducting social research ! We gave you millions so that you could gamble with them now ! - You do not understand . She is now closer to the answer then we ever were ! she will be under special surveillance and your clock is ticking ! Do you ever clean your nose ? let 's go . - I have to get dressed you fool . Your folks don 't like me . I don 't want to come in . Be in grandpa 's room . I 'll be done in two minutes . grandpa . Good evening . - I 'll be back in a minute . Don 't sit on that chair ! There is a strange story about that chair . I remember as if it was yesterday . It was on 5th October 2000 . I think of that day with tears in my eyes . tear gas ... I just remember I have found myself in the Parliament . People were shouting and running . I started running down the hall looking for something to take as a trophy of this great victory . I burst into a room on the first floor . I was reaching for a painting when I felt a presence ... I glanced around and saw Misko ! - Who ? - Slobodan Milosevic . I also thought it strange that he is not in some bunker or on a private island . I am looking at him and he is looking at me . a tentacle sprouts from his forehead . not believing . Tentacle is growing longer and slowly it takes shape of an eight-legged beast . When its tail was free from his head bouncing from wall to wall like lightning until it went into the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Serbia . In that moment he became aware of my presence and quickly ran through a secret door behind him . Then I heard a noise behind me . People were entering this room too . I just grabbed the chair he was sitting on and I ran away . And that is the story of that chair . But this is a garden chair . - You mean that one ... You can sit into that one . It 's from the flea market . - Move . We are meeting Broni in five minutes . Is that my son in law ? - Good evening . we are in a hurry . - That 's ok . I just hope that there is no hurry in bedroom . we already ... - I know . But when you drop it who will rock the cradle ? - You mean that ? Don 't worry . Bojan is a girl . - What ? - What ? He went to a hospital and told them you know . What ? - Bye ! - Tell me what ! Tell me what ! Are you insane ? That woman will never speak to me again ! June 12th . Edit insane . Cause inherited . nice surprise indeed . I will be glad to give you the highest mark . And all thanks to Herb 's chip . Too bad I didn 't know about this little wonder I was just on my way to Herb to get it out but for some reason I stopped here first . What ? You let that moron grab your tits ? You don 't understand . That was what professor was expecting . I hope he doesn 't expect you to lay down with financiers . that boy has been alone for 15 years . I 'm the first that has succeeded in approaching him a little and discovering another side of him . Beside autistic side . And what if he discovers another side of your personality ? that is my job description . You slut ... - Your daddy is a slut . really ... but I am too much confused since you put that thing in . but please do not scream . You 'll upset Moki . - Last time I got painkillers . Of course . I have plum painkillers . but I also have iron pills . You want that ? - Even better . Here it is ... don 't scream ! Moki ! I can 't believe what she 's doing to herself . She has been acting weird . And that job at the TDR ... and that thing with green salad and liver . For the last few weeks that is all she has been eating . she says . - Iron ? - She has been ordering beet in cafe . - Don 't mention iron . You cannot imagine what she has done two days ago at the Sound Arena . is everything OK ? - Never been better . Try this . This stuff really blows you away . - This is iron ! - Yes . Here are six . - Give me twelve . - You gulp down six of these and you feel great ! - I really like you so this is on me . You take three of those and it is terrific . - Give me ! What 's up ? - That stuff was so good that we came for more . I was so happy that I puked . She poisoned us with those pills . and she tells me she has hallucinations . But never mind . It is important that she had passed that exam . She even wants to take us for a game at the hover dome . No kidding ... That 's very nice of her . her and me . Dream team . Yeah ... It 's been almost six months since we have been there . You remember how it was ? They carried us out ... Goal for each team is to be first one to reach the switch . The first player pressing the switch opens the appropriate door . There are 4 switches . The winner is the team that finishes first after three laps . Woo and Sanja are since I am paying for all this I think that my team should win . - Dream on . Why engage in extreme sports when we can extremely drink and smoke ? Winners also pay for bandages . - Losers ' ' mamas are bold . Has someone noticed that I have matching hover board and pants ? - No . That I have matching hover board and pants ? - No . they play the ' Gate' and get themselves killed . Same last week . We had to scrape them from walls with a toothbrush . All junkies . Junkies . and you activate number three ! - Roger ! You are really not normal . white beard and hair ... I cannot believe that you haven 't seen the idiot on tracks . If it weren 't for that you would 've gone to three and plastered yourself all over it . You are right . And you would be paying for this liquid sound . you could buy that round you promised . Kiss my ass . Fucking digital smokes ... you know . Money is short and I can 't make ends meet . My Jemalia and Suzana and Moebius don 't work . These new robots Moebius ! Moebius ! Daddy is giving an interview . - The horse has shat ! taking our jobs ... I 'm taking you to a terrific place . You are so down lately . Why don 't you ... And what are you doing taking pills all the time ? I like them . I suppose I am anemic . I don 't feel my legs and arms lately ... Could it be malnourishment ? - Whatever . Do you know for Data-date ? - Don 't . It 's sexoholics anonymous out there . - It is OK . Think of it as a cyber masked ball . And when they take off the masks ? Geeks and pimples all around . That place is a little shop of inadequacy complexes . but tonight I have a date with a ' butterfly queen ' . Your boyfriend pushed me into this . He said : ' How long do you plan on screwing plastics ? ' Where ? - Inside . - Invitation ? bro ! I don 't have one . - Than take this one home . could we arrange something ? all of you immediately go for a wallet . dude ... not dependence on things . Do not search for Identity in brands but inside you ! but in Art for example ! - You are an artist ? - Yes . Poet ... Can we hear something ? - Let 's see ... 'Innocent bite succumbs to falling . Will anyone hear a plea from acid Rectum bubbles satisfied . I don 't need this . Why doesn 't it start ? my face ? Help ! Edit ... - Hello . What are you doing here ? - I am here with a friend . Aren 't you dating Bojan ? - I am here with a friend . It is not a problem for you . Everybody is hitting on you . I am here with a fr ... Who 's hitting on me ? You haven 't been to Faculty ? - No . - In some mysterious way professor Grkinic succeeded in losing your test . You should check in to do it again . in his office . leave all metal objects you have . Everything is here . I don 't have anything else . - Alright . Now we will see ... baby . - What ? - That is just jewelry . get her ! alarm ! I was afraid I am not mad enough ! Baby ... My pal says that you have some jewelry in your panties . Get her ! Damn ... Come in . of course . Just get in . but we should finish very fast . and I feel that there is no need for these ciphers . You know that I like you too . as this will be . there is a girl ... Fuck . maybe it would be better if I go . Yes ... Everything is ... Great ! I can 't believe . You were ready to kiss him ? Long kiss goodbye . Both from his family and his career . Either that or to let me pass the exam ... With compliments . - You think he would agree to that ? He is tricky . - He would . I made couple of shots while I was unzipping him . I don 't think his wife would love that . You want to see it ? I think you won 't like it too much . Miss ... Please leave all metal objects you are carrying . too . Wait . No ... I have that one . Who 's that ? Hallo ? - You have to take me to this private clinic . Sanja 's friend is working there . - I have some business with Woo . Probably another chapter in a debate ' Plastic or meat ' . I think that plastic is the right answer . you idiot ... - Something is wrong . Maybe I ate something metal . - Chocolate wrapping isn 't edible . but now I need concentration . Let me see ... clinics ... that 's it . Jurija Gagarina 42 . You are searching wrong town . Relax and breathe deeply ... Like that . doctor ? Doctor ... Doctor ... What 's that ? I don 't know . - How can you not know ? but ... not a doctor . And what did she say ? - You don 't need a mechanic . How do you know that ? - What ? She must have said something . too . - When ? - Now ! But I haven 't seen you . - Where ? - I know . How ? - What ? - Shut the fuck up ! I 'm talking ! with hi ... either . run ! What did they do now ? - They probably didn 't want to pay . He 's probably some poor guy that died thanks to malpractice and now haunts the clinic . - I am not a ghost ! I am not a ghost ! I am not . Enter here . I 'll explain everything . but still I know little more than you . But still I know little more than you . since this is a little bit creepy . This better be convincing and simple ... Because all those hallucinations ... I 'm sorry to interrupt but first you sprinted from the clinic and now you are talking with a garbage can ? Only you can see me . Bojan went there . then I 'll see you later . Bye . Sergey . I have something that will interest you . Two hours ago we got this shots via Undernet . - What 's that ? - Full body scan Edit Stefanovic . I am not sure what happened . I just remember ... feeling . Everything was indistinguishable group of stimuli at first and then I started to slowly systemize . I connected verbs to audio and tactile sensations . I was memorizing faces and their names as well as all other things surrounding you . As well as all other things surrounding you . I learnt language and laws of your world . Only thing I didn 't know was who or what I am . From time to time I would try to move but you probably just felt it like slight tingle in your limbs . Good . I was afraid I have heart condition and in fact I was going schizophrenic . - You were not . I have material existence . I found out that when you did . both visually and audibly . - We communicated visually ? - Yes . Both visually and audibly . - We communicated visually ? - Yes . The guy on the hover dome track . That was me . Also the one that passed by when faculty security was chasing you . Just before I started controlling your limbs . Controlling ? What did you do to me ? metal nervous system . Identical to yours . As your brain can so can I. First time I could only make you go suddenly to the left . In the fight with the security I controlled your whole body . The most important thing for me is that I started controlling your metabolism . Thanks to me your system could stomach all those pills of iron and small bits of metal you swallowed . - Wait . How did you end up in me and how can you be alive when you say you are made of metal ? I have no idea . - Tell me what 's the first thing you remember . Everything started with an image . Multitude of lines intertwined into some impossible shape . Abel 's graph chart ! What is this ? - You can clearly see from this scan that Miss Stefanovic had a chip removed from the left forearm . military chip that has also shown good results in treatment of schizophrenia . It 's also used by students to cheat at tests . God knows where they get them . Interesting part is on these micro scans . there are small plates now . When we analyzed them we noticed unusual imitation of circuits but somehow chip started to multiply like a cell . made from some unknown metal that also have started to sprout micro-conductors . You can see here that these micro-conductors have grown so much that now they trigger metal detectors . They reach the tips of fingers as well as the sensory organs the spine and the brain . Conductors on organs end in small sensors ear or finger . Chip has developed its nervous system parallel to host 's . That chip is alive . - Exactly . The same thing happened to our computers when they worked on Abel 's formula . For some reason our software fell into ' algorithm absurd while this chip started developing some qualities of a living being . - Because it found consciousness . Edit 's subconscious . - This is wonderful . Now we have the machine that could calculate Abel 's formula . professor . But you cannot do that ! What will happen to Edit ? What is one sacrifice compared to the benefits it will bring to the whole society ? Can you imagine ways in which predicting future could help us avoid any conflict ? Think of thousands and thousands who will live thanks to this . the Group will see to that you are in no way connected with her disappearance . her capture won 't be that easy . You 're the one who fights like crazy ? You want me to fight you like crazy ? - Please do . That was the best man from Sergey 's team . What you just saw happened half an hour ago . We checked . Edit never trained any martial arts . Are you there ? Can you hear me ? - Of course I am here . I am always where you are . - You are making me eat all those iron pills ? - Yes . - But why ? I already told you I 'm alive and I can also hunger . Iron is my food . - Food ? Do you want to say that you eat ? You have mouth ? and to grow I must make you take pills and iron bits . How can you make me ? - By controlling your hypophysis . Every time you take certain amount of iron which makes you feel wonderful . And if I stopped doing that ? - It would be very hard for you . You would die from lack of iron in your blood . I need you well and alive . I can kill viruses in your body very precisely . Bit by bit . And I can also ... I feel your ... What are you doing ? - You don 't feel me . I am just creating a sensation that you feel me . As I can create this sensation too . That was the last time we saw her . that was two days ago . - What is happening to her now ? Nothing . She tells me that she is depressed and that she would like to be left alone . now she has new buddies . Garbage can and coffee machine . She is so far in the left field that she is in the locker room . You try to eat all that iron and stay normal . Now I will have to use magnet to drag her to bed . What 's this ? - Iron pills . Why do you need them ? - I am sick . There are a lot more where I found these . - I am very sick . You could shit horseshoes with all the iron you ate ! Why are you rummaging through my stuff ? - Because I don 't want to find out you are junkie when you 're found dead in a basement ! What are you talking about ? - I know everything ! I 'm not blind . Look at you ! Get out ! - You have no idea . - Shut up ! You are junkie ! You lazy dope head ... Am I lying now ? What 's this ? I didn 't know you 're so tough . - I am not . Stop this bleeding or I will faint . This hurts ! That woman can drive me crazy like no one can . How 's that you are image of my subconscious and you are male ? - I have no idea . You tell me . Who knows what kind of latent personalities are hiding in you . And why do you look like that ? I have no idea how do I look . I can 't read thoughts and I don 't have a mirror . I can draw you . Then you would see through my eyes . But I am not really skilled at drawing . - It is not a problem . you can also draw like ... - Bruce Lee ? - Yes . I could try to guess in whose image you created me . Did you have some sort of sexual encounter as a small girl ? Sexual encounter ? - Subconscious is usually and since I am a male I could venture a guess that you either fought or played ' visit the doctor with someone who looks like me . One mystery less . I don 't believe it . I have totally forgotten about that . Here you are now . And he is still wandering through the channels of your subconscious after all those years . This is why you are probably a little bit hypochondriac . You remember that once visit to the doctor was shut up . It is finished . You were right . It turned out pretty good . I am handsome . so that I can be a complete person . I ought to give you much more in order for you to be complete . Start with a name . - Let it be ... Edi . - Be a little more creative . We are different after all . Not that much . Edi is OK . And we have to go ashore . and professor wanted to see me . I wouldn 't expose myself so much out there . I have other plans ! but guests shouldn 't overstay their welcome . Edit . Come in . Sit down . thanks . - I wanted to talk . too . About metal entity in your body ? - You know ? - Yes . That is what I wanted to talk about . We know everything . iron pills and audio-visual sensations caused by the entity you charmingly named Edi . And we can help you . - Yes ? Our microsurgery is advanced enough to complete the operation . That machine in your body is what we need . Machine capable of solving Abel 's formula that is alive and can overcome 'algorithm absurd ' . I don 't want to be a calculator . - What ? I don 't want to be calculator for the rest of my days . Your problem . - I think that is also your problem since you do not stand a chance of surviving that procedure . ask your good friend Abel . He sees future . - That is right . immediately call Abel to come . - Of course . Abel . Sit down . Edit would like to ask you something . - Abel ... Professor will send me for an operation . Will I survive it ? No . A week later they will kill me as well . A miracle happened to you that needs to have its purpose which is to create a much better place from this world . It would be a pity to miss chance to overcome the future . Don 't listen to his bullshit . Run ! floods . All of these can be prevented Only with Abel 's formula and that entity that is capable of calculating it . professor . Suspect is fleeing across level 3 . move ! It is vital to capture the suspect alive . Use NNs ! Shit ! Suspect is on coordinate 7R-72V . She moves towards highway . roger ... please . The hyper-highway begins in 30 seconds . I don 't want to frighten you but hyper-highway begins in a mile . That 's what I want . They won 't follow me there . - Of course . They don 't want to die and neither do I. You just keep our eyes open . Hyper-highway begins in 10 seconds . Is it wise to charge into trucks driving at 250 miles per hour ? The question is how do I get out of there . - OK then . Hyper-highway begins . Have a nice trip . What now ? I think we got away . - Great . Now get me out of here . - Me ? my grandma . A friend of mine asks me why his car doesn 't work ... Is someone following you ? - What ? - I don 't know . Help me . They 're chasing me . - What mess did you get yourself I swear . I was set up by this TDR guys . I barely escaped . - What do you mean ' I escaped ' ? They 're tracing you by satellite . They can see if you have lice . They could if I haven 't disabled my ID chip . - I cannot believe ! That could be only done by ... - Bold Jack from Bezanija ! we have to go back to enemy stronghold tonight . Are you crazy ? I have to risk my life for some loony risk our lives ... He groped your tits ? - Abel saved my life and I owe him that much . too ? - We 'll be done in 10 minutes . It 'd be best we reacted right now and caught them off guard . And then what ? - I already arranged it with Sanja . I 'll be on her raft on Ada Ciganlija . We 'll meet at the TDR parking space exactly at 20h . I 'll enter when they are changing guards . I 'll open backdoor . Broni will keep watch on the first floor while Bojan and I proceed to Abel 's room on the second floor . We 'll plant small decoders on security cameras . That 'll give us 3 and half minutes to finish all . We 'll pass security area 2 using the pass I stole from professor . there is a coded lock on Abel 's door . I 'll open the door using Herb 's logical picklock . Bojan ... Hold the door in order not to close and to fool sensor lenses so that it looks like no one has entered the room . Where is Abel ? - He is in Kosutnjak building . Just like every Thursday . - Thursday ! What ? You planned everything except for the fact that it is Thursday ? Crazy fuck ... we 'll do the same there if we hurry . - What are you babbling about ? There are so much cops out there right now as if Santa Claus is giving away gifts . You burry your own shit ! - I have to go meet Woo . What a building and elevator is not working . now I feel bad for not helping her . - What ? We 've helped her understand that she is an idiot . ninja ? Look who is waiting for you ! You are here . Let me introduce you to Abel . you were right . Santa Claus was there . great . it 's for me ? - Very perceptive . cast replica of Ron Jeremy 's penis . right ? - I got paper tube . but your idea is even better . - You better take this one . Who knows what he did with your . - Youth is always fooling around . But please someone tell me what we will do with Abel . He can stay at my raft but someone should stay with him . I 'll stay with him and you will rotate . madam . State security . Is Edit Stefanovic at home ? - No . - Do you mind us taking a look around her room ? - What if I do mind ? We could charge you for aiding and abetting . Then take a look . - Thank you . I knew she was pushing drugs . Stupid cow . I 'd like to ask you something . then your phone ... You must be really hungry . - It 's not me . It 's him . him . occupies space and wants more and more food . I 'll give it to him . If not I would die . - What do you say we go to ' Cyber Toys ' . That takes you out of depression every time . I need someone to take depression out of me . Why did I do it ? Edi ... What did I realize ? What day is today ? Why don 't you say it already ? - What ? You know what . What we have been avoiding all this time ? - That . Edit ... You 'll die soon . Damn you ! - Why me ? When you 'll realize that I 'm not here of my own free will ? Why don 't you let me try the operation ? You are clutching at a straw . - That is called will to live . That is called despair . You know you wouldn 't survive . Abel told you that . - Liar ! You are covering your ass . There is no mine and your ass here . It is our ass . Look at that this way . You got sick and died . What now ? She ran away and there is no way to locate her ? she has disabled ID chip . - That is true ... But she won 't be able to run for much longer . - Why ? Judging by the date when Edit saw the formula it can be seen that entity is growing fast . At this pace he should have doubled its weight . Based on the time that has passed since I think that Edit has serious health problems . I cannot do anything more for her . Should we try to take her to some private clinic ? Without ID chip they won 't even look at her . Has anyone called her folks ? - I did . I told them that we are going to Sirogojno village To visit loom-knitting museum . Why are you looking at me ? That was the only thing I could think of . - Never mind . Cops have probably visited them by now . – They were at your place ? Of course . - Fuck . I 'll have to lay low for a while . and this one there . all right . you just have to move one match so that it equals ... You are really not much of a mathematician . Hallo ? Do you hear me ? Where do you think you 're going ? I have to finish something . I give up . Take me for the operation . This wasn 't really wise . - What ? That I had implanted damn chip and now I am sitting here waiting to die ! - And you will . Police is already on their way . Sergey has bio-meter on the wall . Shit ! because now you have the opportunity to spend in jail the life you try so hard to keep . It would be wise to move on . Now I really hate you with all my being ! Denial of the ego is good first step in spiritual development . - Eat spiritual shit . Anti-matter in carton . Revolutionary formula powdered anti-matter . A simple use in useful package . Call now and make your own pocket space with reduced price . And that 's not all ... you are such a shit eater ... while Edit is who knows where with that thing ... So what if you wrote the formula ? I finished fourth year on faculty and I am not silent . On the contrary ... I 'd like to scream . - Hi . Where is Edit ? - How should I know ? You were supposed to keep an eye on her . You saw the condition she is in . - How should have I stopped her when she kept hitting me with electricity from her finger ? She says she wants to go and I say ' go ' . Why didn 't you follow her ? - How ? And what about this joker ? - When did she go ? Two days ago . - Two days ago ? when one of you two should have come to relieve me . she could be anywhere . I am ashamed to face people because of you . Look at me ... I haven 't seen parents for days . Everybody is looking for me . I 've been charged with cop killing and now nothing else matters . I am going to die anyway . At least give me some strength to go to hideout . I don 't want to die in this garbage . Bojan ! You speak ? - You have to go now . I 'll guide you . we have intercepted an ambulance call . Girl matching Edit 's description with disabled chip in her arm . We have dispatched one car with the ambulance . The ambulance is spotted ! Did you check everything ? - Yes . - Is everything all right ? She is dead . - Turn left . roger . - Left again . we are ordered to drive the body to the TDR building . we are driving in circles . Now left . - I say we are circling ! they are already here . - You have to get her body . but I can 't think of anything . There is no ID chip . - So what ? - What do you mean so what ? Maybe someone is after her ? please ! Good evening ! - Good day ! Use the procedure 32 ! Undress her . - As in naked ? and leave her here . In the middle of the room . It is wonderful . - Is it better like this ? Yes . Don 't stop . we are not here to cuddle . There is no time for that . - Edi ... What are you doing here ? Where am I ? What is this place ? This place ... Some eggheads have postulated about this place . It would be too complicated for me to go into that now . Let 's say we are in a Heaven . I am dead ? - We are dead . but let me start at the beginning . When whole adventure ended we were faced with a question ... What now ? Who now ? And we knew the score . just like yours had a drive for self-preservance . I would continue to grow even if I didn 't want to . That night at Sergey 's ... I killed him . That made me think . Then something strange happened . I noticed I was getting older . I am not immortal . like everybody in that room . Meaning of life ... - Exactly . being a machine . In the moment of awareness I have processed equal number of conditions for staying and not staying in function . For the first time in my life it didn 't matter to me . I wanted for you to go on living . To give life was my last task as a living being . But at that moment it was already too late for you . You were killed by metabolically induced problems caused by the presence of a foreign body . Then I died too . There was this last problem . What about my body ? Before I died I programmed it you are not really dead . My perception of the reality has radically changed in the moment of my death . I have realized that there is direct connection between spirit and matter . I realized that I could control matter with spirit . And now it is time for me to say goodbye . Here is a parting gift . It 's over . Everything is over . - Not exactly . Police is on their way . I rise from the dead and you manage to spoil that . What was I supposed to say ? - For example ... 'You are alive ' . She is alive ! That is the story ... When I come to think of it I cannot say that I am sorry this happened . I learnt a lot about me and about others . but they didn 't arrest us . and whole case as well as accompanying damages mysteriously went away . everybody is doing OK . I am still with Bojan ... Woo is still in love with Broni . Professor wasn 't able to make his future predicting machine but he got rich with the revolutionary chip . so he is now lying around on his own grass field . About that kid from kindergarten ... I easily found him and told him I remembered everything . And Edi ... I hope that he is swinging on some electronic cloud with Otomo .

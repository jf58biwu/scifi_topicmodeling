 My name is Detective Brett Hopper . And this is the day that changes everything . You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder . Who the hell are you people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this because I 'm living the same day over and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . Someone went a long way to set me up . Konrad Deitweiler , Tobias Booth ... But I finally discovered who really killed Garza . Miguel Dominguez ... A gang member who 's supposed to be in prison . My informant , Damien , helped me track him down . You gotta tell me about Dominguez ! Whose address is this ? And I caught the killer . - I cleared my name ... - You 're a free man ! I thought this was over . I thought I 'd escaped the day ... You wanna watch the sun rise with me ? ... but I didn 't . So now , I 'm wondering what comes next ... and if anything I do even matters . Day Break 1x11 What if he walks away ? Hey , Andrea . What 's up ? Rehab ? Waow ... Yeah , I know . And he 's really lucky to have you . Hey , Damien . It 's me . I know . I know about the safehouse . I have a lead on some people who I think did this . And I won 't be able to make the 9 o 'clock , but tell your niece I said happy birthday . My name is Brett Hopper . You sent me a package , you 're in danger . Stay away from Baxter , skip the morning swim and get out of town , Eva . Then , it 's gonna be okay . Yes , I know about the briefcase . No , listen . Don 't even stop for coffee , Margo . Why ? Because if you don 't , you 're gonna get hit by a bus ! Who are you talking to ? Nobody . Just people . What is it ? Never does it get sick of it ? Sick of what ? I don 't know . Just ... talk to the same people , doing the same things ... Doing to the same places ... Sure I do . Not everybody I work with is a ray of sunshine . That 's the job . People count on us . What 's the quote ? 85 % of life is just showing off ? I don 't know . Some days ... Some days , I really hate this job . Man up , Preisser , nobody likes a whiner . Did you hear how that cop talked to me back there ? He was totally disrespectful . If you joined the IA to make friends , you 're a bonehead with the enemy . Cops are gonna take shots at us . If you ground it up now , that guy 's still gonna be running parking tickets when you make lieutenant . Hey , Hippo ! Take that last nutty bar . I won 't sue you . Hey fellas , question : when did you stopped caring ? Excuse me ? No , for real , you used to be cops , you used to stand for something . Used to help people . What happened ? You . Why did you just give up ? We 're tourists . It 's a serious question . How does it feel to be dead inside ? Do yourself a favor , alright ? Walk away . Right now , just walk away . Yeah . That 's sound a better idea . Thanks guys . Hey , baby . I thought you left . Let 's blow off the work for a day . - What ? - Yeah . Call in , take a vacation day . Oh , we shouldn 't . Come on . - Should we ? - Just one single day . We could be here tomorrow . Look , in ten years ... what 'll you remember ? A day doing the same old thing ? Or a day getting crazy with me . How crazy ? You like ? Yeah , I like ! Maybe ... Maybe we should stay somewhere less expensive . My friend knows this nice motel off the street . Baby , if we 're gonna do this , we gotta do it right . What is gotten into you today ? Just felt it was time for a break . You know what I love about Vegas ? Free drinks and hot chicks ? It 's unpredictable ... You gotta deal the cards , roll the dice . Anything can happen . - Come on . - You got a history , here , you don 't want me to listen . It 's not that unpredictable . Pretty much everyone leaves the standard loser . Not us , baby . Not today . Five hundred dollar ? And that 's for a regular suite ? Last minute avaibility is limited . How much for your best suite ? The presidential suite starts at five thousand dollars a night . We don 't have that kind of money . We 're gonna be right back , Amy . I thought at the bank you said you 're only seeking out a few hundred for this trip . - How much is that ? - Just got to make one bet . That 's it . Since when did you become the big gambler ? I want you to get us some drinks , and I 'll meet you at the bar . OK , but don 't go crazy , that 's all the cash we have . I got you . Alright . OK , can I make a bet on the Dodger game ? Sir , this is Las Vegas . What kind of odds can you get me on a bet that 's like , let 's say ... Dodge over the Giants , 11-10 . Seven run , Dodger rally about the bottom of the ... 9th . I take it you like long shots . How much did you put down ? - All of it . - What ? You gambled 6 runs in the bottom of the 9th . It 's OK . They 'll come back . Oh , it looks like he got it ! What did happen ? Pretty one homerun to left after a naughty fast ball . Keep watching , it 's good . Oh my god , you win ! Look at this place ! Look at the view ! So this is how the other 1 % lives . - You hungry ? - No ... You spoiled me enough . It 's been the most amazing day . I still don 't know how you did it . I don 't know . I guess ... luck finally came my way . Look ... fake New York ... Fake Italy ... Do you think next time when we come here we can stay at fake Paris ? Why do we gotta setup for fake anything ? If you could go anywhere ... in the all world . Where would it be ? New York ... - Paris ... - Mexico . I used to go down there when I was a kid . Those pelicanos ... it was magical . DAY 2 ( del vo ) - No way ! - What ? Of all the places in Mexico , I used to come here when I as a kid . For real ? Right before my parents split , we used to come down every spring , me and my brother used to swim and play here all week . What are the chances of that happening ? What 's up hot mama ? We should , like , just move here . It sounds good to me . I think you 're kidding , city boy . You can never leave LA . You 'd miss all the excitement of home . Actually I could get used to this . As long as you 're with me . - Buenos dias , señor , señorita . - Hey , what 's happening ? - What 's this thing called again ? - Abahablast . What 's in it ? Well , a concoction of rhum , tequila , brandy , triple-sec , orange , and pineapple , cranberry and a special secret ingredient . You want some ? No , thanks . I like my liquor like I like my pizza . Less than three ingredients . - You 've got some , and leave a little . - Yeah . This is amazing . I could do this every day . Maybe we should ... DAY 3 ( del vo ) Buenos dias señor , señorita . Thank you ! - What is thing called again ? - Abahablast . What 's in it ? Well , a concoction of rhum , tequila , brandy , triple-sec , and ... What 's the secret ingredient ? It wouldn 't be a secret if I told you . This is so amazing . I could do this every day . DAY 4 ( del vo ) What is this thing called again ? Abahablast . It 's got rhum , tequila , brandy , Triple-sec , orange , cranberry , pineapple , and the secret ingredient is pomegranate juice . How could you possibly know all that ? I don 't know . I just knew it . This is amazing . I could do this every day . Buenos dias señor , señorita . Buenos dias señor ... This is amazing . I could do this everyday . ... do this everyday . ... everyday . This is amazing . I could do this every day . You know , for someone who suggested this trip , you don 't seem very happy to be here . I am . It 's great . - I love it here . - No , you don 't . I can tell . What 's going on Brett ? I don 't know , I 'm just not feeling this place anymore . We just got here this morning . What if I told you that ... A surfer dude is gonna eat sand in about like 5 seconds . - How could you even ... - Just watch . Look . Yeah . His name is Spence , he works for an overnight shipping company . He got caught smoking weed on the job , so they fired him yesterday . Are you making this up ? The waitress , that 's about to bring us here Abahablast . Ask her ... if she left her curling iron on this morning . Buenos dias señor , señorita . Ask her . You left your curling iron on this morning . Oh , my God ! Don 't worry , her house isn 't gonna burn down , she just left a mark on the sink . How could you even know that ? This one , I have been working on with practises . " Sorry , that one sank like a dive-bomber at operation metal horn . " Sorry , that one sank like a dive-bomber at operation metal horn . - Thank guys . - All right , take care , man . - You 're scaring me . - That 's ok . I 'm just living the same day over and over and over again . - What ? - Come get a drink with me at the bar . There 're some things I need to tell you . I mean , at first , I thought that I ... There was something wrong with me . I got an MRI , I spoke with a doctor . He didn 't find anything . You 're saying that we 've done this 12 times . Same beach , same hotel . A place you came , as a kid . But here 's the thing : I know how happy this place makes you . But I just ... I just ... I can 't take it anymore . So you pick up another spot , and we go there tomorrow . Anywhere . No problem . So while we 're living large in Mexico , you 're accused of murder in L.A. - Yeah . - And you know who 's framing you . And these people back home , they 're getting hurt , every day . Yeah , but like I said , the day ... It resets itself every day . Look . I used to think that if kept doing these things , if I could solve the case , if I could find the real killer , if I could keep everybody from getting hurt . I used to think that I could fix the day . But I ... I did all that stuff . Over and over again . And I ... The day kept repeating , so it doesn 't matter . I decided , if I can 't do anything to change it ... that I 'm just gonna ... I 'm just gonna take care of you . I 'm just gonna make you happy . You ... But you lied to me . This trip , this day . It 's just been a ... one big lie . - Wait , it 's not " one big lie " . - What did you expect would happen when you told me this ? Why are you telling me this now ? Because I 'm tired of pretending I 'm having fun . Just pretending . Fine . That 's not what I meant . I 've known it for a while . I just don 't have the word . What did you say ? Everything about this is wrong ! What about those people in LA who need you ? They ... It doesn 't matter . They don 't matter , it keeps ... It matters to me ! Well , it 's not gonna matter tomorrow morning . Because , you 're gonna ... forget we even had this conversation . You wanna bet ? Hey baby , I got an idea ! Why don 't we ... take the day off ? You 're suprised ? Sounds like stuff I wouldn 't normally do . Why don 't we ... go to the desert , over ... San Francisco ? What you think ? Same floor , let 's go ! Go ! Move , move . Sir , if you 're here , please identify yourself . Move , move ! Clear ! Clear after search , detective . Guess at least you 're free to check the rest of the building , doesn 't it ? You know what I think ? Police must come out here all the time . Nobody comes out of the houses to watch . Cops is second nature in our days . Too much reality on TV . Go . Drive . Wow , partner . I think you jumped into the wrong car . Shut up , I know who you both are . Fencik , Buchalter . You 've been following me for weeks , videotaping . I wish I knew what you 're talking about . Look , we could drive or we could all go talk to the cops , right now . - Maybe that 's a good idea . - We can both tell ' em you 're ex-sheriff deputies . That you two are involved in the Garza murder . They 'd love to find out who killed the guy in the tub above my appartment . Do yourself a favor : get out of the car , - and walk away . - Or we can call Detweiler . Or maybe Booth ? Tell ' em what a big mess you 've been making of this whole thing . What do you say ? How about you ? - Let 's go . - Attaboy ! I said put Shelten on the line . He 's not here right now . And when he 's done torturing some beat cop , have him give me a call . Well , perhaps it 'd be best if you left a message . Tell him thanks for nothing . sending us on a wild goose chase . Alright , now you 're gonna tell me ... You 're gonna tell me where Rita is . - Who ? - My girlfriend Rita , the girl you 've been following . Videotaping . Her ! You got a good taste . A girl nice to wake up next to . Shut up ! It 's gonna be OK . We get down on the station , all this guy is gonna do is asking a couple of questions about Hopper . Billy , calm down . What 's wrong ? Look , I can 't , not today . - Who is it ? - It 's Billy . What kind of trouble is he in now ? Billy , just slow down , you 're not making any sense . What ? What happened ? Someone found the body . It must be tough keeping tabs on a girl like that . Don 't open your mouth again . - I 'm just saying ... - What are you just saying ? Your girlfriend has a secret , that 's all . You don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . Like you said , we 've been following her . Taping her . Maybe we know things that you don 't . Give me that video camera . Give me the bag too . Don 't try to think cute . Damn ! How long have you been following me ? Wait ! What are you doing ? Stop the car ! Stop ! You should 've walked when you had the chance . Maybe we should call this in . I 'm making an executive decision . Why did you get in the car ? Idiot . How are you feeling , kid ? What did you dragged my father into ? Your dad and I were told to make the case go away . Uncle Nick ? What the hell are you doing here ? I 've still got eyes and ears at the station . I know all about your little situation . Who 's this shooter ? He 's not a shooter , he 's a friend . I can count the number of guys on the force I trust on one hand . Hippo 's three of ' em . He heard they were setting you up on this Garza thing so ... I told him to stay close . Your old man was on the right track with the girl . He 's with you . You 're not just keeping an eye on me . You want me to look in the Contreras murder . The Jane Doe from 15 years ago . - Where did you hear about th ... - I know ... already , Nick . I know that Booth made the call to kill Isabella Contreras . I know Dominguez pulled the trigger and I know that you and my father ... I know that you and my father took money to make this case go away . When did you find all this out ? Today . Don 't judge him , Brett . Everything your old man did was to protect you , your mum , your sister . It was never about the money . Well , then what was it about ? What your stake in all this ? We might wanna sit down . I don 't want to sit down . I want to get this interview over . Where the hell is Chad ? - I don 't know , he 's not here . - So , where is he ? None of your business . I 'll be conducting the interview . Consider me Shelten . Now for the day . Not till you gain a hundred pounds and grow a pair . I know about Danny Yan . Strip club . Bank withdrawals . Call me when Shelten 's back . I will be out the rest of the day . For the night or by the hour ? - Excuse me ? - We 're looking for a guy . Name of Billie Foster . Sorry , can 't help ya . What room ? The only way I 've managed to stay alive in this thing is to stay out of it . But you didn 't stay out of it , you saved my ass today . I helped you out because I owed your old man . There 's more to it than that . What 's your bee with Tobias Booth ? Me and him ... We don 't exactly see eye to eye . You wanna take him down . You really think I 'd do some that stupid ? No , that 's just my job , isn 't it , Nick ? Right ? You want me to get to Booth ? I didn 't pick you , son . - They did . - Why ? Booth 's vindictive . Paranoid . If he set you up for this , he thinks you can bring him down . So the question is : What can you prove ? I can prove that Dominguez isn 't in prison , that he hit Garza last night . What do you got ? Dominguez 's print on the gun that killed Garza . They tried to plant it in my place but there 's evidence of a stakeout in the apartment above mine . Holes drilled in the floor . Surveillance wires . A dead body in the tub . Can you tie any of it back to Booth ? There were chain of corruption that would make your head spin . Crooked cops , federal prosecutors , prison officials . I 've waited in 15 years for this to blow up in Booth 's face . Well , you should 've come clean a long time ago . None of this would be happening . I took the money , Brett . This son of a bitch had me . And I wasn 't going to piss away my life the way ... What ? Say it ! Like my father ? Listen . Here 's what we do . We get on my boat , go fishing in Baha for a couple of months . - While the heat died down . - Can 't do it , I can 't leave , not today . I gotta find my girl before they do . This girlfriend . You trust her ? Rita ? Yeah ! Of course . You watch yourself , Brett . I had Hippo get your truck for you . Any word ? I checked the station . Put a bulletin on her place like you asked . The lady at the hospital said Rita took a vacation day . Vacation day ? What d 'you mean she 's not here ? She started at 8 . She called in , said she was taking a day off . Anything can happen to anyone . - Is it possible ? - No , something 's wrong . What about Chad , did you speak to him ? That 's the funny thing , he 's MIA since this morning . Hasn 't checked in with his minions all day . This is odd jumble , something 's ... - Something 's different here . - What do you mean ? That 's enough ... Did you ... - Did you sell me out ? - Put your hands where we can see ' em ! Did you sell me out ? - Backward ! - OK , OK ! - Turn around , turn around ! - By the right . Did you follow me here ? Brett Hopper , you 're under arrest for the murder of Alberto Garza . I didn 't do it , and I can prove it . You 're also under arrest for the murder of Chad and Rita Shelten . What ? What did you say ? Come on , you heard me . Sit down . Sit down or I 'm gonna sit you down . Try . Try and sit me down ! Come on , look . We 're all cops here . Now we wanna hear your side of the story . There is no story , because I didn 't do anything . I 'm sure you 've got an alibi to back that up , right ? Yeah , he 's halfway to Baha , by now . How convenient . Wanna know what I think happened ? Thrill me . I think you killed Garza then you ran home to your girlfriend for a little wine down when she booted your ass out . And she called her old boy toy Shelten , so you followed her to the motel . Motel ? What 's the name of the motel ? You busted in on your gal pal and Shelten just as they were playing seven minutes in heaven . Coming off the rage with Garza , - You gave ' em both what they deserved . - What was the name of the motel ? You should know it . You left you .9mm at the crime scene . I told you . I didn 't execute anybody . That 's probably a guy named Miguel Dominguez . You know Dominguez ? No , but it 's funny you should say " execute " . OK , Garza , you did him cold . But these two ? Not so neat . You shot Shelten , five times . You shot your girldfriend another three . I don 't want to see that . That 's what I call a crime with passion . I don 't want to see those . - Real shame . - Stop it . She 's quite a looker . I need backup ! Attacking an RHD detective . Not exactly the best way to prove your innocence . I already proved ' em my innocence . When did you do that ? It doesn 't matter . None of it matters . How can you say that ? I didn 't think this day could get any worse . But it did . And I tried to changed it ... but Rita still died . And now I 'm scared that tomorrow is gonna come . And she still gonna be dead . You cannot do that . Nobody can . See , you just have to do what 's right . Punish the people who did this . You don 't understand . I understand just fine . You 're giving up . Stop saying that . I am trapped ... in this thing . Hopper , what the hell happened to you ? You have no idea . Then give me an idea ! You don 't have all the answers ! Or you wouldn 't be there , - feeling sorry for yourself ! - Andrea , please . So pull yourself together and give me something . OK ? Anything . Look at me . You 're not alone here . But I need you to help me . If you think of anything that can get you out of here . I know where there is an other dead body . In a bathtub . Let me see what I can do . It 's right in here . But you said there was a body here . It was . There was . Choi . All right , come in , come on . Come , hurry . What 's going on , Hop ' ? They cleaned it all up . Cleaned what up ? It was Pelican Bay . It seems Miguel Dominguez is resting comfortably in his cell where he 's been for the last 15 years . Let me speek to him . The man who knew the warden . A guy named Mangle . Detweiler did not send you . I spent 12 years under that man since the ... You can 't speak to him , he 's in on it . So now , the warden 's part of the conspiracy too ? Uncle Nick ? You did this ! You told them everything I had on Dominguez . You cleaned up that mess ! I didn 't clean up anybody 's mess ! Now calm down and hear me out . They killed Rita ! I didn 't have anything to do with that . Do you forget who saved your ass today ? Hey , what 's going on in there ? It 's OK . We 're all right in here . So what is this uncle Nick ? You 're here to save me or sell me out ? You don 't understand , kid . I don 't call the shots . I 'm just middle management . A conduit for information . Yeah , you mean you 're Booth 's bitch . Booth is a monster and if I could , - I 'd put a bullet in his head . - Don 't give me that . Every single thing I told you about Dominguez you ran and told Booth , didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? I 'm sorry . I ... When he- - I didn 't have the choice . When it came down to you or them , well , I picked me . See , Booth may have his grand agenda but I got one on my own too . - Survival . - You were my father 's partner . Spent Chritmas with us . Bought Jen her first bike . You sat at our table . How could you do this ? Do you have any idea how powerful these people are ? If they wanted to , they could drag you right out of this cell - and make you disappear . - But they won 't . They need a fall guy . That 's why I 'm here . To make you an offer . You do your time , peacefully , mouth shut . And I can garantee your safety . Nobody in here would touch you . You 'd be out in seven years . I 'm begging you , kid . - Give it up . - I gave up already . But the day just got worse . And I 'm paying for it . You think this is bad ? Think of the alternative , the people you love . Booth can get to them . Look at you . Coming up in here like you 're family , like you care , You 're no better than Detweiler or Booth . So take your little offer and shove it up your ass . It 's easy to say now . But eventually , they 'll own you . Just like they do me . And your dad . Your girlfriend . What did you say ? What are you talking about ? Everybody 's got secrets , kid . My assets , Kinda irrelevant now , isn 't it ? What are you talking about ? What do you know about Rita ? Some days , I really hate my job . Man up , Preisser , nobody likes a whiner . Did you hear how the cop talk to me back there ? It was totally disrespectful . Chad , it 's me . Rita , everything OK ? Yeah . No , no , it 's not . What 's wrong ? - Talk to me . - It 's Brett . - This morning he ... - Did he do something to you ? No , no , it 's nothing like that . I wish I knew how to explain it ... Don 't forget Hopper 's a cop . He may be expecting us , don 't take any chances . Did you say Hopper ? We 're going to his appartment , I just got the warrant . - For what ? - Murder of a D.A , Alberto Garza . Hold on a second . Rita , is Hopper there ? Is he with you ? Yeah , he 's in the shower . Listen to me , I want you to get out of there , right now . - What 's going on ? - He 's wanted for the murder of a guy named Alberto Garza , get out of there . Change your plans . Hopper 's not at his place . You called Chad ? Does he know I 'm here ? He must have called SWAT . Why him ? Why did you call Chad ? - I don 't know . - Think , there must be some reason . I don 't ... I woke up this morning . - I just had this feeling . - What kind of a feeling ? Something different . Like something was wrong . You 're keeping something from me ? A secret ? A secret ? Like the one you 're keeping from me , Brett ? Chad said you 're accused of murder . That all thing is a set-up . You have to believe me when I say I did not kill Garza . How did you know it was Garza ? - You were here with me all last night , you know I couldn 't have done this . Everything about this is ... wrong . And maybe I 've known for a while , and I just ... didn 't have the word . No , I wanna protect you , I wanna keep you safe ! I don 't feel safe , right now . Rita , please . I 'm not the one that 's different this morning . It 's you . You 're not the same guy I went to sleep with last night . You should go . No , I 'm not leaving . Then you can explain everything to the cops when they get here . Glad you could make it . You and me both . Those skinheads were to smoke my ass back at the safehouse . Thanks for the heads up . Least I can do . I still can 't believe Hopper and Baxter set me up . They gonna answer for that . We got bigger problems . Garza got wacked last night . So , what does that mean ? They 're making their move . And neither one of us is gonna like where that 's going . This whole town 's going up in flames . So , I say we take ' em out now . Torrez , Booth , all the lot of them . First , we talk . We gotta be smart . So what , you gonna have a sit-down with Booth ? Not with Booth . I 'm going above him . Straight to the man at the top .

 Previously ... So beta is causing these hallucinations . Elevated heart rates and body temperatures . Like you experienced in the past ? And I 'm experiencing now . There may be a chemical reaction that acts like a psychotropic . A contaminated batch of H.A.L.O.S ? All of us are running low-grade fevers except for Jen and Wass . Please . Certainly explains what 's been happening to me . What would it have to gain ? We 've been hiding it from the crew , from the world . Maybe it wants to be revealed . Paula ! Steven ! She 's got no thumb ! She can 't pilot a Venus lander without her thumb . You will never know what I gave up for this program . This is all yours now . I 've been having this dream . I 'm pregnant . I 'm up here , And I 'm floating , naked ... through here into the airlock . And there 's a really bright light emerging from behind a planet ? Yeah . I 've been having that same dream for , like , two months . What happened today - these hallucinations , the dream ... This has nothing to do with H.A.L.O.S , does it ? No . So no-one has suffered any hallucinations for approximately ten hours . Is that correct ? Correct . Well , again , we apologize for the bad batch of H.A.L.O.S , folks , but flight surgeon has assured us that by this time , your bloodstream should be free of psychotropics . We understand . Claire can 't assure them of anything , Mike . You know that . The caveat , of course , being that everyone 's biochemistry is different , so if any of you do experience further hallucinations , in all likelihood they will be slight and of no cause for alarm . Roger that . What 's the final word on our science funding ? I second that question . Yeah , the lawyers and comptrollers are into it . We 'll figure out something to keep you guys working . Ah , that 's great , cos the nearest unemployment office Is 30 million kilometers away . And I hear the lines are killer . So , dudes , I 'm glad you 're all back down from your trip , But we got a lot of work to do . Roger that . Venus is only a week away , people . I need to see you busy . We 're on it . INAUDIBLE You guys heard the man . And we 're all buying that the H.A.L.O.S were the problem ? Till proven otherwise . Do you have a better explanation ? I don 't know . Do you ? No . But I 've got a back-up in the head . Urine bypass valve on toilet 2 won 't open . Come on . I 'm an aerospace engineer , not a plumber . It 's funny . You look like a plumber . A plumber who needs a shave . If I was a plumber , I 'd be making more money . Fine . Goss wants us busy , we 'll get busy . All right , Paula , you ready ? Two hours in the hyperbaric chamber , Then an hour of physiotherapy . What , it 's only three hours out of your day . We 're all gonna be working our asses off so you could just ... ( sneak away and practice the lander , and nobody would even notice . ) How are they doing ? I 'm seeing an occasional spike , but they 're all pretty stable . Think we sold them on the H.A.L.O.S ? I 'm pretty sure Ev believes it . Ted 's handling Donner . Just give me a few days where nothing happens . When do you tell them ? November 5th . Day after the election . Why are you turning off the comm ? This is between you and me . The H.A.L.O.S didn 't cause those hallucinations , and you know it . Nadia , mission control already explained what happened ... I 've never worn my H.A.L.O. , and I was hallucinating as bad as anyone . Ted , I 'm second in command . I need to know what 's going on . I need to know what I 'm doing . What you 're doing , Nadia , Is programming the Venus insertion burn . Not if I 'm being lied to . No one is lying to you . Now program the burn . And that 's a command . DONNER : I suppose there 's a kind of comfort in following orders . All you have to do is exactly what you 're told to do . It 's effortless . It 's mindless ... And it completely absolves you of any responsibility ... Unless you get a conscience . JEN : Well , frankly , I 'm a little freaked out . I mean , six years without a H.A.L.O ... That 's like jumping without a parachute . Prayers and pure thoughts are not gonna stop you From hitting the ground . It 's not the H.A.L.O.S. If they were causing the hallucinations , you and Wass would 've seen something . Not true . Listen , Zoe , I was one of those people that never got off on weed . So put yours back on . I 'm not allowed to . Rollie thinks they 're dangerous . Seriously , you guys have no idea how weird you all were . I 'm still weird , Jen . You know how I was telling you I 'm having strange dreams ? Well , we 're in a strange environment . We 're gonna have bad dreams . Dream . One dream ... over and over . So ? Donner 's been having it , too . 'Eve said we had no choice but to leave them . ' How the hell would she know ? I 'm trying to tell you , she has freaky high clearance , Complete access to the archives . And she looked at everything ? Yeah . Telemetry , cockpit tapes , readings from the EVA packs . Donner , Sharon and Walker weren 't going to make it . I hate to admit it , but Goss was right . Yeah , I don 't buy it . She just took a huge monkey off of our backs . Your back , maybe . Nobody talked to me . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? She show you any proof ? No , I believe her . So why don 't they go public with it , huh ? Share it with the world . That 'd make my life a lot easier . You and I both know they have their reasons . She flirt with you , Ted ? She 's working you , Ted . I don 't trust her . Neither should you . Ah , the morning after . Please don 't shout . I 'd ask you how you are , but that 's kinda self-evident . Hey , listen , about last night ... the , uh , rule thing . Didn 't we already ... say too much last night ? Yeah , we did . I just wasn 't sure if you 'd remember any of it . Well ... clearly , you are a rule breaker , And I am a rule follower . So ... I have rules about all kinds of things ... You know , taking out the garbage , buying clothes . I have a rule about , you know , not wearing eyeliner under my eye because it makes me look like an albino goth whore . Do you see any eyeliner under my eye ? No . No . That is because it is a rule . You are free to , uh , break as many rules as you like , And I 'm free to follow mine ... yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Good morning . Oh . Well , there he is ... Dr No-show . Oh , you know , I 'm glad I didn 't show up . You guys look a mess . I tried calling you . You could 've ... I don 't know ... picked up . Jen , I know . I got pulled into a meeting , And I turned my g off . I 'm sorry . Well , you know , I do still have the costume , so I could always put it on ... Drop by your place . We could do a little trick-or-treating . Mmm , except I don 't think you 're gonna feel like doing anything tonight after today . How so ? Okay , listen up ! You got ten minutes to finish getting dressed to get down to the track , run a 5k , assemble in the stands . Let 's go . Space is an unforgiving mistress . One mistake at the wrong time , you die . That 's the reason we have a chain of command . That 's the reason you follow orders . Now , Donner and Shaw are standing behind me today because they have learned this lesson . In a critical time , they did what they were ordered to do , And that is what we are gonna teach you to do now . For the next 12 hours ... ( All gotta be about Mars . ) Let it go , brother . All we want you to do is follow orders . We say run , you run . Push the red button , you push the red button . An order is an order . We say it . You do it . No questions . No comments . You will be evaluated solely on your capacity to obey . Is that clear ? Stand up . Excellent . Run another 5k then report to the manual training facility . Uh ! I think they 're trying to kill us , man . Ajay ? Go to comm 6 . I need some private plumbing advice . Never work with your mouth open . Ha ha . That 's very funny . You didn 't have anything to do with the design of this thing , did you ? Subcontractor . They made a fortune . Uh , listen , do you have any clue what 's going on ? ( I 'm not in the loop . ) There 's a loop , though , right ? Affirmative . Goss , Eve , Claire ... And I believe Rollie . Yeah , this H.A.L.O. thing 's ball cock . Agreed . Any suggestions ? What would be our course of action , Maddux ? There 's nothing to do now but follow orders . That 's not very helpful . WOMAN : Everyone stand . Take a deep breath and hold it . You 're all stressed . You 're all tired , and now I want you to think . The task at hand is to simply duplicate a sequence of lit pads that 's presented to you . Follow the computer 's lead . Is that clear ? What happens if you screw up ? You just exhaled , Mr Wassenfelder . Go out and run a 2k . You serious ? I 'm as serious as I can possibly be . Let 's go , Wass . Move it . Group , exhale . Would anyone like to go first ? Candidate Barnes . Excellent . Monkey could do that , right ? BUZZING We 're also testing your determination . You may find in your careers as astronauts that there are orders that you must obey that cause you distress . Regardless of pain , regardless of outcome , you must proceed . This test requires that you proceed . BUZZING AND GASPING BUZZING AND GASPING BUZZING AND GASPING BUZZING CONTINUES MULTIPLE BUZZES AND GASPS That 's enough . 2k . Then report back . Candidate Schilling . What 's for lunch ? Oh , roast turkey , Mashed potatoes , stuffing , cranberry sauce and pecan pie right out of the oven ... In my head . Ah . How 's plumbing ? It 's uncooperative . Although it 's just busywork to keep our minds off other things . I talked to Jen about our dream . Not the details ... just that we were having it . And ? She still believes it 's the H.A.L.O.S. Ajay doesn 't . He thinks , uh , they 're keeping something from us . So what do we do ? I don 't know . I don 't know what we can do . Just fix the toilet and ... follow orders . Should be easy for you . You 're a rule follower , right ? BABY CRYING What 's that ? Is that your hallucination ? ECHOING CRIES What is it ? Okay , you don 't have to tell me what it is . Can you tell me where it 's coming from ? BABY 'S CRIES ECHO Here . In this bay . CRYING CONTINUES Up there . Pod 4 . BABY CRYING Uh , flight , I 'm showing the storage pods being rotated . You have it on the watch list . I 'm reporting . Copy that . Thank you . Put the storage bay up . Donner and Barnes . ( Donner , whatever you 're doing in the storage bay , ( they 're watching . ) Copy that , Ajay . Can you stay on this comm with us ? We 're getting warm . BABY CRYING CRIES ECHO It 's in there . Huh . Here , you try . That 's weird . Ajay ? Can you pull up the manifest for pod 4 ? I 'd like to know what the hell is in there . Let me see what I can do . I don 't know what led them there , but they 're trying to get in , and you have to do whatever it takes to stop them , commander . Get their minds off it and put them to work . Copy that . Heading down to the bay . He needs to handle Donner . He 'll try . Let 's clear the press gallery . I 'm going downstairs . Did we just lap you ? Couple times . Ohh ! 12k in one day . It 's a miracle I 'm still breathing . There are no miracles . There 's only karma . Well , until a few weeks ago , my karma was living on rice and jelly just so I don 't have to walk the three blocks to the store . So if I 'm not dead right now , it 's either a miracle or reincarnation . Ohh , taking orders is ass . For a chance at this mission , I 'm an order whore . Ah , space as a trade-off for free will , huh ? Well , if you believe in destiny , taking orders is free will . Oh , he 's too deep for me . Damn , girl , you know , you might wanna pace yourself . We do have 2k to go . Last night teach you nothing ? Yeah . If you don 't mind the barfing and the hangover , mixing painkillers and tequila is a quick way to lose 5 pounds . Look , I 'm serious . You 've been through a lot . You might wanna go easy on yourself for half a minute . A little late for this mission , you know . Not for me . Not anymore . Hey . I 'm sorry Goss put you through that this morning ... The Mars business . Guess everybody seems to think that we did the right thing but me , which seems kinda strange since I was actually there . For what it 's worth , I tried to find you last night , But you 'd already left the building . I had no motive in telling Ted first . Except my reputation for being difficult ? He says you didn 't believe me . No . It 's nothing personal . If you have data , I 'd love to review it , but , uh , I was told we saw everything . There are certain classified materials that were withheld . I 'm not permitted to give you the reason why . And I 'm just supposed to take you at your word ? Yes . Eve , what exactly is it that you do here ? I understand you 're involved in astronaut selection for some reason , but I 'm a little fuzzy on why . I 'm employed by the Burtran Corporation . We have $ 3 trillion invested in this mission . Trillion ? With a " t " ? Well , I guess you could make some money in oil back in the day , huh ? We 'll be deeply involved in mining rights throughout the solar system . My job is to protect our investment , which means making sure we have the best astronauts onboard . Now , although Goss may not agree , I feel strongly that that includes both you and Ted , so , yes , I went in . I had to make sure you guys were clean , and you are . End of story . I followed my Goss ' order , so if that makes me clean in your eyes , that 's terrific . But my gut tells me that Walker and Lewis could 've made it and should 've made it . So until I see something that shows me different , that 's what I 'm gonna believe . Pick it up ! Stand up . Extend your arms in front of you . This is round two . For a final exercise , we 'll be testing your capacity to follow orders that bring distress to someone else . Candidates Sharma and Barnes , Please drop your arms . Sharma at the console . Barnes in the chair opposite . Ahem . Drop your arms and sit . It 's like the Milgram experiment . I don 't know it . 20th century obedience to authority study . It was inspired by the Nazi atrocities in World War II . " I was only following orders . " Yeah , but in Milgram , the subjects fake the pain . This is more sadistic . Proceed , Mr Sharma . Zoe , I ... Do it . Get it over . But I ... Do it . BUZZING AND GASPING The test requires that you proceed , Mr Sharma . I can handle it , Ajay . This is what you have to do . BUZZING AND GASPING BUZZING AND GASPING BUZZING CONTINUES BUZZING REPEATED BUZZING Hello , princess . Where 's Paula ? With Mintz . Finished . Her bay ? Empty . The galley . Nada . Bathroom ? Still not working . The can 's really important , dude . Paula ? Check the lander . Is this how you unravel the mysteries of the universe ? Well , Einstein played the violin when he was stuck . I just like to annihilate mutants . Hey , careful with her thumb ! And my glasses ! So aggressive . Pod 4 . Pod 4 is surplus , medical and dried rations . Uh ... circuit boards . Little of everything . I should be able to get under that . Yes , everyone should . It 's probably a glitch in the scanners . Did you guys try one of the other pods ? No , and I 'm feeling a little stupid . AJAY : Donner ? Yeah , Ajay . All I 'm showing in pod 4 is surplus . In fact , it remained empty until the very last cargo delivery . Does it say who made the delivery ? Uh , according to the payload records , The Burtran Corporation . You want to tell me where you 're going , Donner ? We knew five years ago that Burtran was a major player in this mission . Now you 're grasping at straws , Donner . Okay . Let 's open up the pod , take a look . There 's nothing but surplus in there . Is that according to Eve ? It 's on the manifest . Ask Paula . I don 't have to ask Paula . Open up the pod , and I can see for myself . Why are you being so bullheaded ? It 's classified , Donner . Classified . You know what that means ? I 'm not gonna open it until they tell me to . Now that 's all you 're gonna get from me . Whatever you got in there is endangering your crew , and you know that and I know that , whether you 're willing to say it out loud or not . A couple of us could 've died yesterday , and we deserve to know why . I like Eve . I was best man at the wedding , remember ? But she 's got you carrying a pretty heavy load right now , and I think it 's about time you started sharing it . Screw the orders . Do what you know is right for the mission . ALARM SOUNDS Flight , that 's a N.O.A.A. Warning . Solar terrestrial dispatch . Ship 's proton sensor panels are activating . Active region one zero six niner six approaching central solar meridian . We are looking at a major " x " - class event . Solar flare ! Give me an ETA o the ship . Intercept seven minutes . This isn 't beta . No . We have substantial coronal mass ejection with intense proton activity , " x " - class , 2.3 . Antares , you have 6 minutes , 35 seconds to shut down And get to a radiation shelter . This is a big one . Copy that . I 've got the lab . Lander bay ! Flight deck . Already on it , Donner , but I could use some help . Mintz . On it . Med bay is shutting down . Wass , let 's go ! Just putting dishes away in crew quarters . Closing the lab . Shutting down all nonessential circuits . BUZZING REPEATED BUZZING BELL RINGS Okay , there 's the fire alarm . Everybody up . Remain calm . Follow me . Oh , god . I 'm so sorry . It 's all right . Come on . We gotta go . Okay , this way . Come on . Single file . People , let 's go . Let 's go ! Single file . This way . Go ! The exit 's this way ! The exit 's this way ! You 're taking us the wrong way ! Wass ! Straight ! Straight ! This way ! Up the stairs ! We should be going down . Why are we going up ? Let 's go ! Look out for one another . Straight up . Straight up . Faster ! Let 's go ! All right , head to the fire escape and down to the streets . One , two , three . Four minutes , Jen . Gotta go . Rufus . Where 's Paula ? Inside . Where 's Jen ? We left the lab together . She was right behind me . Jen , where are you ? Jen , do you copy ? 'I 'm in the lab . Here , just give me a minute . ' We 're losing the comm . Let 's go . Let me check on her . No , no , no , no , no , no . There 's no time . How much ? 3 minutes . Piece of cake . No , Zoe ! I 'll make it , Donner ! Let 's go ! MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY Radio blackout 's starting . How long will it last ? A 2.3 x-class event could last a couple hours . There won 't be any communication with the ship until the flare radiation passes . Are you picking up anything on their med bands ? Negative . But you 're showing an elevated heart rate . I think we all are . Jen , what the hell are you doing ? ! My gene samples . If I leave them in here , they will fry . We 've got 90 seconds to get to the bunker . Let 's go . Come on , Jen ! Zoe , I will get there . You go . Damn it , Zoe . Donner , the radiation has already killed the comm . It is building . We need to close this door now . 50 seconds . OK . Come on , come on ! 40 . If the comm 's out , we 're getting major rads now . Donner ! It 's Zoe and Jen . OK , you wanna give ' em a couple seconds ? ALARM BLARES Whoa ! Jen , we have to find cover . Get inside now . 20 seconds . Come on , dude ! Get in here and close the door . Donner , please . Donner ! 10 seconds . I cannot afford to lose you . Get inside now . Just ... Donner , stop acting like an A.S.C.A.N. Get inside now ! What are their chances ? Depends on the event ... and if they were able to get under radiation blankets . They won 't die immediately . Oh , God ... POUNDS WALL Sorry . How much do you think we 're getting now ? Well , the shield doesn 't provide us with much protection from a solar event , but the ... water and the polyurethane around us ... we should be fine . Until 20 or 30 years from now when we all come down with cancer . Well , that 's the price we pay for doing what we do . Hey . Hey . I thought you could use this . Oh , thank you . You 're welcome . It 's been an hour-and-a-half . Yeah . Shouldn 't be much longer . You know , you can 't give in to the fear . You got six more years of this . You don 't have to remind me . We just have to believe that they 're gonna come home to us . You know what I do every night ? What ? I clean my kitchen table . Jen hates it when I leave my stuff out on it ... My wallet , my mail , whatever . Drives her nuts . " A kitchen table is neutral territory , Rollie ! " You have an office . Use it ! " BOTH CHUCKLE So , every night , I collect my wallet and my mail , and I put it in my desk in my office . And then I wipe down the table ... just in case Jen comes walking through the door . Hmm . It 's goofy , I know , but it keeps me sane . No ... It doesn 't sound goofy at all . Thanks . It 's big and long . N.O.A.A. profile puts it close to the January event in ' 36 . They 're gonna take some rads , even in the shelter . Shouldn 't be a problem . If it was a one-time event . These guys are gonna be taking all kinds of radiation on a six-year mission . Every one of these is bad . Arnel , can you pull up the profile of that January ' 36 event ? Yeah , let me dig around . It might take a few minutes . KEYBOARD CLATTERS Schrodinger 's cat . Schrodinger 's cat ? What we are to mission control - alive ... and dead at the same time . Paula , it 's just basic quantum mechanics . You put a cat in a steel box along with a vial of hydrocyanic acid and a very small amount of radioactive material . I don 't think I wanna hear this . If even a single atom of that radioactive material decays while the cat is inside the box , a relay mechanism trips the hammer , which breaks the vial ... and it 's curtains for kitty . The cat is dead . Yeah , but we don 't know that because the box is closed . It 's only when we open the box and see the condition of the cat , the cat becomes one or the other - dead or alive . Clearly , you are alive . But mission control doesn 't know that because the comm is down , so to the world , we 're Schrodinger 's cat ... dead and alive at the same time . What does that make Zoe and Jen ? BELL DINGS , DOOR WHOOSHES That 's the all-clear . COMPUTER BEEPS We 're starting to get data . OK . Let me know when the comm 's back up . I need to speak to the commander . Still want a look at that profile from ' 36 ? You found it ? Put it up . It 's identical . OK , you want to tell me what the hell 's going on ? 18 ... ( COUGHS ) 19 ... 20 . Fire escape . 21 , 22 , 23 ... Let 's go . Fire escape . 24 , 25 , 26 ... 27 , we got 28 , 29 . 30 . What ? Zoe 's not here . What ? No , no . Let 's go . Outside and down . Zoe 's not here . Neither is Dr Greer . The fire department 's on the way . Let 's go . Westin ! They might have gone the wrong way ! Outside ! It 's Zoe , for God 's sake ! Ted . I got it . Zoe ? ! Dr. Greer ? ! Let 's go . No . Jen ! Jen , get back up here now . Zoe 's dead , Dr Greer is dead and you 're dead . Under different circumstances , we 'd all be dead . Sorry , Jen . Well ... ( SIGHS ) How bad was it ? BEEPING This can 't be . Donner ! Are you OK ? Yeah . What the hell do you think you were doing ? No , Donner , we 're fine . The neutron detectors are reading zero . What ? You think that 's strange ? Wait till you see this . Yeah . Come on . Mission control , this is Antares , do you read ? Copy that , Commander . We read you loud and clear . Well , the neutron detectors are indicating no radiation at all . Zero . That 's right , Commander , because what you and we in mission control just executed was an exercise . A drill . It 's based on the solar event of 2036 . I knew it . My astrophysics class in college did a case study on this . Goss used the same profile . An exercise ? Did you know ? No . Commander , switch to comm 10 . You had no right to stage a drill without briefing me first . Well , you were losing control of your crew , Ted . I had no choice . I was not going to let them in . That 's not the way it looked to me . Their attention had to be refocused , the chain of command reinforced . Do you copy ? HE SIGHS Roger that . Now , round up your crew and get back to work . Venus is six days and counting . They need us in the science lab . We were under the blankets . We couldn 't see them but we could hear them . Dios mio . Unbelievable . Dude ... . .they 've gone fractal . Fractal is a geometric , right ? Like a shell ? It 's a geometric shape that can be split into parts , each one a reduced copy of the whole . It 's ... It 's infinitely complex and all around us . Everywhere in the universe ... A galaxy is a fractal shape . A hurricane , a wave , a shell . Ice . The Stock Market . And I guess tomatoes are . No such thing as miracles , huh ? What is going on ? Kill the media feed . Rollie , enough of this . What 's happening up there ? Is this Beta ? It wants them to know . Not now . NADIA : My God . Incredible . A solar flare didn 't do this . No , there was no solar flare . It was a drill staged to get Donner off my back . A distraction . Goss just told me . Distraction from what ? What 's he got hidden in the storage bay ? Mission control , are you seeing this ? Uh ... roger that , Ted . We 're just ... We 're speechless down here . We 're gonna be looking for some explanations down here . We 'll have people interface with Jen . They 'll come up with something . Yeah , well , some of us already have a pretty good idea of what caused this . I think it 's time the rest of the crew knew as well . He 's right , Mike . You know he 's right . That 's a negative , Commander . You will all return to your duties and execute this mission . That is an order . Well , my duty as commander of this ship is to protect the lives of my crew . A big part of that is them knowing exactly what this mission is . What exactly is the mission , Ted ? The answer 's in the storage bay . It 's in pod 4 . LOWERED VOICE : Talk to him . Now is not the time . Talk to him . Uh , Ted , honey , it 's me . Just ... um , breathe for a moment and think about what you 're doing . I 've been thinking about this every minute of every day for the last month , Eve . It 's a mistake . Trust me . Yeah , well , you know what ? That ship has already sailed . Ted , please . Commander , you will not enter that storage bay . I am ordering you to stand down . You will not ... LOUD HUMMING My God ... HUMMING CONTINUES What the hell is that ? Beta . It 's singing . Sounds like a whale song . It 's beautiful . 'It 's been said that the capacity to blindly follow orders 'is what turns ordinary people into monsters . . . ' We have to stop them . There 's nothing we can do . 'Or ordinary people into heroes ... 'All depends on exactly what the order is . ' Shut down all power to the storage bay . 'And that 's the catch ... 'because we 're all responsible for who we pick to lead 'and who we choose to follow . . . ' Sir , the storage bay is not responding . Try the main buss . ' . .whether we give orders or take them . . . ' Negative , sir . It won 't shut down . I 'll see what I can do . 'We all contribute to the outcome . ' Commander , you have got to take control of your crew . 'Have them report to the observation deck at once ! ' 'The responsibility falls on all of our shoulders . ' HUMMING CONTINUES 'And no matter who 's giving you orders 'and who 's taking them ... 'sooner or later , 'we all have to answer to a higher power . '

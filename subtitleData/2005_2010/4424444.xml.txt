 the.prisoner.2009.part03 Previously on The Prisoner . Now , I wanna get back to New York . There is no New York . There 's only the Village . If there are others like us , who dream , I can 't leave here , can I ? Why would you want to leave ? The problem ... six ... is in your mind . Well , why shouldn 't I be interested in you ? But never doubt your family . You can 't get to the Towers . I 'm six . I 'm six ! You okay there ? Do I look okay to you ? What do they call ya ? They call me " six . " Well , six , it 's not wise to hang around here . Well , I wouldn 't wanna be not wise , would I ? You could always walk . This may take some explaining . Can I-can I get another drink ? A man finds himself senseless in some back alley . I 'd say he has a problem with the drink Or trouble with a lover . My guess it 's a lover . You have a knack I 've noticed . You talk a lot , And the more you talk , the less you say . Is that something they teach you ? It 's-it 's nerves . You make me- - you make me nervous . We 're here and we 're staying here , So you can talk all you want But we 're not leaving until you tell me two things . Okay . Who are you and what do you want ? Come on- - why me ? That 's three things . Where is this place ? You 've had an invitation . Oh , thank you , for coming , six . Nine-o-nine here , He 's an undercover , one of our best . I thought you might 've noticed that . I want you to work with 909 , six . You think I 'd work for you ? Oh , no-no-no , not for me , for them , For the people you would be watching . You 've announced so loudly your opposition to me , Your disbelief of everything we stand for . They might trust you . We already have our suspects . And I know you want to make contact with dreamers . I offer you the apparatus and expertise Of our highly Undercover operations to do just that . Why would you give me all that , if it wasn 't a trap ? Oh , my dear six , it is a trap . You have such a high opinion of yourself . I wondered if you would be clever enough To turn this opportunity to your own advantage . Still- - Everything you say is a trap . All right . Let 's do it . Hello ? Anvil Undercover 's work in cells- - twos , threes , fours . You and I are a cell . First rule , you tell no one about your cell . We don 't know the other cells . They don 't know us . That means everyone could be an undercover ... Every single person in the village . So , someone could be investigating you right now , another undercover cell . It 's a possibility . Yeah , I suppose . There 's our suspect . His number is 1955 . And what makes him a suspect ? We had a report . How do I find out if he 's a dreamer ? Get close . You have a position here . Teacher . You start today . Be careful- - 1955 might be an undercover himself . He may be compiling a dossier on you . Come on- - come on- - come on . Uh-uh , they 're with me for history first session . Sixteen thirty-four has them for math after that . Then , it 's sports . I don 't see the point myself , really . And then , they 're with you , Uh , for surveillance techniques all afternoon . Doesn 't that seem a bit odd , teaching surveillance to kids ? Why should it ? It 's your subject . No reason . And who can tell me which number two oversaw the reformation . Sir , it was two the 14th . It was , indeed . And who can tell me the first woman number two ? Put your hand down , 1,100 . Sir , was it lady number two the great ? Who was number one ? Ah , the oldest question in village history . Go on , 1,100 , you tell them . There is no number one . There never has been , and there never will be . The concept of the number two is an act of humility . The title reminds us all that we are all public servants , Even number two . No one is number one . Very , very good . None of my friends have a relationship with their father Like ours . That 's good , isn 't it ? I 'm certainly glad of it . Perfect . It is as it is ... As it should be . Nineteen fifty-five , can you keep a secret ? You 're an oddity , six . I have these crazy thoughts . What if there was some other place , You know , outside the village ? How mad is that ? I 'm one of those lucky people who doesn 't need distraction . Uh , no wife , no family . I 'm not interested in alcohol or gambling . Sports , cigarettes , no . No- - everything I need is right here . When I was five , I dare to try When I was six , I picked up sticks Is everybody here living in fear ? Yes . No-no-no . It doesn 't - it doesn 't have to be like that . Good and bad- - right and wrong . The people here , they get on with it . They have jobs . They clean the streets- - they-they wait on tables . They work in hospitals . They look out for their neighbors . They 're decent , ordinary people . They-they fall in love ... Have kids ... Normal lives What 's wrong with that ? What if they speak out , think differently ? What kind of lives do they have then ? They go for treatment . What treatment ? I don 't ask . So , that 's what 's wrong with your cozy , little village life , 313 , and you know it . The old man , 554 , hell , she was killed right here . They had dreams , they knew the truth . No-no-no--look , I can 't . Well , there 's gotta be others , and I 'm gonna find them . Yeah , I have to stop seeing you , six . The people who get close to you , They don 't tend to live very long . Question- - why does he go swimming after work ? Answer- - because he likes swimming . We 're looking at a man who doesn 't wanna go home . And that makes him suspicious ? He knows he 's being watched . Everything is suspicious , if you look at it properly . Everyone has secrets . No one is without guilt . You just have to work out what it is they 're guilty of . Why don 't you arrest him and ask him if he 's a dreamer ? Well , that would produce nothing , but confusion . He would lie . If I catch him out in his lying , Then he tells new lies , and then more new lies . It 's better to watch him . Wait ' til his guilt emerges . Who reported him ? One of his students . We don 't know which one . Reports come in anonymously For the safety and protection of the informant . That 's nice . Joggers . Good place to go lookin ' for dreamers . Usually one of the newcomers . Someone a bit too eager , Pushing themselves too hard , right at the front . Runnin ' like they wanna get away from somethin ' . So , tell me the kind of work you 've been doin ' , so far . What do you got there , 6616 ? My mother goes to yoga on tuesdays . She hasn 't missed one in the last 23 weeks . Then , she missed one . That 's suspicious . Maybe it 's just she wasn 't feeling well . What do you have there , 1,100 ? My birthday presents . Long distance speech recording device . And a mobile person tracker . Very nice . Sir , have you worked with the latest roach cam technology ? Uh , no , I have not . You drill a hole or plant it on a suspect , On their clothes or in their skin , So you can observe them 24 / 7 . Well , you certainly all have skills . You 're smart . So , here 's your new task . Find out who we 're working for . What do they want ? What are they up to ? What 's their secret ? That 'll be all tonight . Thank you . The towel is probably a coded signal . Maybe he 's just hanging it out to dry . A signal to who ? The others . What , like a group of them ? Organized ? They meet ? Did one of the suspects tell you this ? No one 's admitted it , yet . Once you 're a suspect , you 're guilty . Hello , you . Am I home ? Yeah . You 're in the village . Well , so I am . Good . How long have I been sleeping ? Too long for my liking . Feels like moments . Oh , dear . You having dreams a bit ? No-no-no . That 's what I was afraid of . Why this time ? Can a man not converse with his wife , Now and then ? I just needed to know that it was still possible . Are you hungry ? Like you wouldn 't believe . Wraps We haven 't much time . I know that . You okay with heights ? There 's a flask of coffee in my trunk . Will you fetch it for me ? Tell me about him , our boy . How is he ? Our boy grew up . He 's curious about everything . Of course , he is . And ? Six . What is it ? Drink up . Got any family , 909 ? Family ? No . I was never much good at relationships . I guess undercover 's don 't like to get too close to people . Something too human about that , huh ? Knock-knock- - who 's there ? We have to get him to the hospital . No . Six ! Kinda makes you wonder . If he 'd do that to himself , Maybe he is guilty . You 're catching up fast . Is that how it works ? Is that how dreamers are caught ? That 's the way I was shown . You decide . I got it . You must be an undercover , Someone with a roach cam . We know so many undercover 's . It could be anyone . It could be you . Six . He 's different . He 's not like the other suspects.He has- - Yes- - say it . Conviction . No harm must come to six . He must survive . But he can suffer . His work as an undercover must make him feel compromised.Hmm ? Has six ever met up with my son ? Eleven-twelve ? Why would he be meeting with six ? Youth is susceptible to wild ideas . Young blood craves rebellion as much as it craves sex . Eleven-twelve spying on you ? No . No . No , of course not . Still , let 's keep an eye on him For his own protection . Thank you . Your father is watching you . He knows you go out at night . You 'll lose your guards . Have I been followed ? He wants me to follow you . It 's a good thing it 's you . He suspects you might be meeting with six . Why would he think that ? I don 't know . How 'd we get to this place ? It 's a good place still , isn 't it ? A safe place . Safe ? Hey , no one 's gonna touch you . It 's good . What ? This , I mean . You choosing me . I seem to recall it was you chose me . When I asked for your phone , You already knew I 'd been sent after you . It 's summakor . Everyone has a monitor . Perk of the job . And you brought me here . Well , you 're free to go . But if you stay , we talk . You know I 'll stay . Let 's not waste any more time . I liked you- - that wasn 't a lie . But if that was all , Then I would 've had the courage to approach you . So , what did give you the courage ? Your reports . You asked questions . You were different . You said things that I was feeling About what was going on at summakor . You must know more than you realize . They wanted you stopped . Nineteen-fifty-five , what happened to you , We have to stop this from happening to other dreamers . What ? I 'm a teacher . I 'm a mistake . No , you 're not . I 'm the mistake . Please , I have a friend.She 's in danger . I need to get her out , get her to safety . Who are the dreamers , and how do I make contact ? I am a history man , that 's all . Why did you do this to yourself ? We could 've found a way out . Why ? Despair ! You 're two and a half minutes late , six . I hear you 've been doing outstanding work . Everything and anything I might do is for one reason . That 's to work against you . I have a new mission for you . Shouldn 't we wait for 909 to get here ? Wasn 't invited . Nine-o-nine 's my new mission . Nine-o-nine has made himself suspect . I have every faith in him as a conscientious undercover . I know he 's been spying on me . Well , of course , he has . But you 've known that before , surely . It 'd be a sorry state of affairs if he weren 't . Why has he become a suspect ? Well , something 's changed . Nine-o-nine , he 's different . Don 't tell me you haven 't seen the fear in his eyes . - Fear is not guilt . - Yes , it is . Fear is always guilt in disguise . I thought you were the man who understood human behavior . Nine-o-nine 's fear must be investigated , Analyzed thoroughly . What is it I 'd be looking for ? Well , you 'll know when you find it . Perhaps he 's a dreamer . Why should I do it ? Because you need to keep up , six . Give yourself a chance . He 's watching you . Now , you watch him . Do it , six , because you want to ... Because you must . Three-one-three , you have to be careful . What do you mean ? I mean , whatever you dream , don 't draw anything , Put anything on paper , or talk to anyone . Why are you doing this ? 'cause I don 't want anything to happen to you . So , we found him . He was hurt . Where did you get these ? They were sent to me anonymously . That 's you ... That 's you on the roof of my building . It 's you ! Let me tell you why I did this . I know why . You 're the undercover . I let myself believe you . I can 't even bear to look at you . We should stop for a while . A few weeks , that 's all . I don 't think your father suspects us , But we should be careful- - My father suspects everyone . Yeah ... But not us ... Not if we 're careful . Come here . You sent those photographs to 313 . Why ? I , I didn 't send any photographs . Three-one-three is not my mission . I want all surveillance taken off 313 . I want her left alone . I can 't give you that . But you can . I want 313 to be safe . That 's my price for keeping what I know to myself . Hello . I was sitting out in the garden a few days ago . - I was being watched . - Watched ? Well , who would do such a thing ? Nine-o-nine is different . Something 's happened to him . My long-serving lieutenant has secrets In his past weeks and months . We 're going to have to dig those secrets out of him . And then , we will know what we 're dealing with . He knows . It 's OK Don 't be afraid . Three-one-three ! Where are you taking her ? No . No , it 's done . Don 't blame him . Tell me the dreams are true . They 're true ... They 're all true . There are dreamers ... They meet ... I 'm sure of it . Find them . Nine-o-nine ? Don 't drink anymore . Please ? Tell me . Why did you resign ? To drink beer . Up on the purpose floor , something is wrong . That is why I came looking for you . I thought it bothered you . I thought you wanted to know . And now , you just want to drink beer . Maybe I don 't know what to think or who to trust . Maybe I 'm just trying to hold on to my own mind here . Maybe drinking beer is easier . You wanted to know . You stopped . Why ? Because you 're already there . What do you mean I 'm " already there ? " The people that you saw . The ones you said changed . The same thing has happened to you . I need you to help me . Where have they taken 313 ? What makes you think I would help you , six ? Help me , or I go to your father with What you did to 909 . They went to the clinic . You 'll never find her . She 's been sent into the tunnels . Tunnels ? What will they do to her ? You don 't wanna know . How do I get in ? Don 't . Only people going for treatment ever get in . Send me for treatment . This one is 909 . Are you okay ? One thousand , one hundred ... We 've gotta get to 313 and find a way out of here . Come , this way . Three-one-three ! Three-one-three ! Shut up- - shut up ! Three-one-three ! Three-one-three ! It 's okay.It 's me . There is a way out- - come on ! I had a thought . The mountains . We could walk , huh ? Escape for a week , huh ? Just us . Yeah , it sounds good . The man is dead . What ? Forget him . Someone your own age , hmm ? Could go to the other place . Well , you 've got this ... The village . Oh , that 's enough , isn 't it ? Curtis ... That 's the name that I hear whispered all the time ... Curtis . We have to go in there now . - I-I- - - No , I 'm trying to help you here . I 'm not going back there . Why-why should I trust you ? - Because ... - Get out . We don 't have time for this . Get out of my apartment ! You know , if you , um , change your mind , You can call me , okay ? [ 5550166 ] I will allow six to be in the tunnels for a while longer . Thank you . You did extremely well . You wouldn 't go against your parents Like my son disobeyed me , Would you , one thousand-one hundred ? No , sir . Now , was this you ? No , don 't-don 't turn away . This hole is exactly at your head height . It could 've been one of the other kids . But it was you , wasn 't it ? We 're going to have to send you for treatment , Aren 't we ? It 's all right . You can finish your ice cream first .

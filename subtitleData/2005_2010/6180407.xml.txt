 In the future my son will lead mankind in a war against Skynet the computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time . Some to kill him . One to protect him . Today we fight to stop Skynet from ever being created to change our future , to change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . Cromartie 's here . - Are you forgetting that I blew his head off ? He came through . He knows we 're here . He 's just a head . We 're programmed to repair ourselves . We 're programmed to blend in . There are other people here . Resistance fighters . Humans sent back from the future by John who have money and guns . Jumper outside the gym . That 's my new friend . The crying one from the bathroom . - We gotta help her now . - No . I need you to look at these photographs . Tell me if you recognize anybody . The young one . His name is Andrew Goode . He was an intern at Cyberdyne one summer . Do you wanna have dinner with me tonight ? My Turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player ever lived ... - ... and probably ever will live . - You talk about it like it 's human . Well , you never know . Andy Goode must be killed . Of all of the training my son received in the jungles of Central America nothing prepared him better for combat than the game of chess . It taught him almost everything he needed to know about war . That to win , you must be patient bold calculating and most of all willing to sacrifice . Andy . I haven 't heard from you in a while . Sorry I 've been out of touch , but after the fire at my house how can I explain ? It was kind of a blessing . - Can you meet me ? - Where are you ? A hotel in Pasadena . I 'm checking into a tournament . - A tournament ? - Yeah , you know , chess . Charlie Dixon . Agent Kester , fbi . I need to ask you a few questions . - What 's this about ? - Sarah Connor . Yeah , come in . You 're really good at math . Yes . You wanna do mine ? Yes . We got a problem . Andy Goode rebuilt his chess computer . The Turk . But you napalmed it . Apparently he 's spent every minute since then in a coffee shop in Van Nuys rewriting the code from memory . Good code is like a good song . It 's gotta come out . Yeah , well , this song might blow up the world . You should have killed him when you had the chance . I 'm surprised it 's taken you this long to bring that up . I 'm busy doing John 's homework . Andy entered it into a tournament . - Computer vs. human ? - Computer vs. computer . It 's the new thing . These programs are too smart and powerful to play people . It gets better the more we talk about it . You 're going to school . You and Tin Miss can meet met there later . - You don 't know anything about chess . - I know a bit about Andy . Besides , you can 't be absent . Absent gets you on their radar . Okay . I get it . I 'll go . Can I have some money for lunch ? Is this the most recent one ? It 's the new edition , it just came out . Isn 't this awesome ? God , I love robots . Come here . So is this one better or worse ? Well , it 's different , really . More adaptable , but less predictable . Not as powerful , for now , but it 's quicker on its feet . It has a hunger for learning , but sometimes the lessons it learns- - Sounds more human . Well , if you want an analogy I 'd say that Turk I had grown into a brooding teenager and Turk II is still more of a precocious child . Speaking of brooding and precocious , this is my partner Dmitri Shipkov . I built the Turk but Dmitri taught it to play chess . She 'll never sleep with you . We should plug that in . Yup . Don 't listen to him . He 's just worked up about the military contract . We have a deal , we split the money . - What military contract ? - Oh , the one the winner gets . Why don 't you people get your story straight ? Is she dead or isn 't she ? Sarah Connor survived the explosion in the bank vault , and so did her son . Yeah , that was eight years ago . You guys just figured that out ? - Yes . - Yes ? " Yes , " what ? Yes , we just figured that out . Babe , who was that at the door ? Oh . Good morning , ma 'am . - He 's from the FBI . - I 'm asking a few questions . - Charlie , is something wrong ? - No . - I 'm looking for the Connors . - Sarah Connor ? Your ex ? - I 'm looking for them here . - Here ? Mr. Dixon wanted to marry Sarah Connor before you . She 's alive . Maybe he 's hiding her here . What ? I already told you , no . No . Okay ? Look , with all due respect , Agent Kester the woman that I knew , Sarah Reese she blew herself up at a bank eight years ago . I never knew and I do not know Sarah Connor . If you see or hear anything , call me . Any time . I never sleep . Just a reminder : Grief counseling will be available in my office throughout the week . - What are they doing ? - Writing notes , for Jordan . She 's dead . - Yeah , I remember watching her fall . - Me too . How will she get the notes ? - She won 't . - But you said- - Sometimes things happen and they 're so bad that people don 't know how to deal with their sadness . So they write it in a note . But I thought people cried when they were sad . Sometimes it 's not enough . Are you gonna ... ? I didn 't really know her . I didn 't either . I like the note part . Thirty-eight . Come on . Pass to me the 50 mm- - Okay , so , three-quarter inch , open-ended . Nice accent , white boy . I have no idea what 's with those guys . They 're always messing with me . Hey , man , I have no idea . - I 'm Morris . - John . Hey , I saw you talking to Cheri Westin this morning . Maybe no one told you because you 're new . She 's damaged goods . She 's my chem partner . Do you know her or something ? No one knows her . Something went down at the last school she was in but no one knows what it is . Her dad 's got her locked down tight . That 's a pretty boring rumor . - It 's truth . - Not much of it . I 'm just looking out for you , bro . Yeah , you and everyone else . An extremely close match between the American and Japanese computers here in the finals . The Americans , lead by programmer Andrew Goode have a slight positional advantage . The Japanese seize control ofthe center with bishop to C5 . The construction 's not consistent , you know . Do you know how many grand masters are here ? How 's Andy doing ? Well , that depends on what your plans are for Andy . On the one hand , he 's in the final round . On the other hand , winner gets a military contract . Military ? Are you serious ? What do we do ? Cheer very hard for the Japanese . Or Cameron will kill him . An unorthodox move by the Japanese leaving their queen hanging on B6 square . The American computer calculating a response . What just happened ? That bishop on C5 totally hammered him . Black 's in total zugzwang . - Translation . - The Japanese just lost their queen . - They 're in big trouble . - Andy 's gonna win . So that was quite a speech earlier . With the agent . That wasn 't a speech. lt was just- - It 's just what it was . What it was , was a lie . - What ? - A lie . You have a tell . - A what ? A tell ? - You have a tell . When you lie . Do you know why you love me , Charlie ? I 'm gonna tell you why you love me . It 's because I 'm not that girl . I 'm not that jealous girl . I 'm not that insecure girl . - I 'm not that petty girl . - Of course not . Yeah , so just don 't make me into that girl by lying to me . If that woman is alive , if you 've seen her ... . This is important . I saw John . What ? - Where ? - Here . In our house . In our house ? In our house ? What did he want ? I don 't know . I think he just wanted to see me . What are you gonna do about it ? I don 't know . They 're fugitives , Charlie . They 're dangerous people . Sarah 's not dangerous . Oh , well , maybe not the Sarah you knew , Sarah Reese . But Sarah Connor killed a man . - We don 't know that . - Well , what do we know ? What do you know ? Ugh . The Japanese desperately hoping for counterplay after the disastrous loss of their queen . Victory appears imminent for the Americans . Andy Goode 's Turk seized control of the match in the middle game and now appears just moves away from winning . Rook to C2 . Checkmate . A shocking turn of events . The Japanese team has won the tournament and the military contract . It 's over . - Andy lost . - But the other team ? Didn 't lose their queen . They sacrificed it . Just like Byrne-Fischer all over again . Byrne-Fischer , 1956 ? - Never mind . The point is- - - The Turk fell for a trap ? It 's like it just choked . So now what ? Go after them now ? No , their names weren 't in the safe house . Andy 's was . What computational error let them put the bishop on E6 to- - ? I can 't help it if it 's stupid . Nobody 's gonna want Andy 's program now . - That thing 's kind of crazy . - He could still be a threat . - It could still become Skynet . - Could also become Pong . - What are you gonna do ? - I don 't know . Maybe I 'll just sit Andy down and tell him everything . Andy . Who are you ? Put your hands above your head . Do it now . Turn . Turn . - Spread them . - Put your hands behind your back . Open . I 'm so sorry , Andy . What 's this ? You should write Andy a note . If you can 't cry . Doesn 't bother you that he 's dead , does it ? The world is safer without him . That was way too easy . L.A.P.D. firewalls really blow . Show me what you found . Okay . Look . No name . But he 's got this tattoo on his arm . He 's one of them . That 's a tattoo from a Skynet work camp . He 's a resistance fighter . From the future , like the three guys in the safe house ? - He was the fourth . - Then you know him , in the future . So do you . He 's one of your best soldiers . They 've been watching Andy Goode . Doing surveillance . Same as us . Well , not exactly the same . He actually killed the guy . That was not his mission . You sent him here to wait for us . Well , then I guess he changed his mind . A lot . I have to talk to him . Talk to him , how ? He 's in lockdown . Freeze ! What are you doing ? - Math . - I already did your homework . I know , but I still have to take the test . I need to know this stuff . Then why did you ask me to do it ? Because maybe it 's kind of hard to concentrate on geometry when people keep dying around you . You have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? You 're grieving . Grieving ? How do you know what grieving is ? I read all the notes . Cameron Baum ? Mr. Harris wants to see you . I know this is difficult for you to talk about . So I 'm gonna need you to be strong . Okay ? - Can you do that for me ? - Yes , I can be strong . People say you were the last person to speak with Jordan before she died . - Is that true ? - I don 't know . Are you asking me if people say I was the last person to talk to Jordan ? Or are you asking me if I was the last one to talk to her ? - I guess I 'm asking if you were . - I don 't know . What did she say when you did talk to her ? I mean , was it something upsetting for you to hear ? She said : " You saw it , right ? Right ? You saw it ? It 's so freaking big and right out there . " She was talking about the graffiti ? It 's freaking big . Yes . Yes , it is . - And no . - No ? No , it wasn 't upsetting for me to hear it . Did Jordan mention any names ? Any specific people that she was upset with ? - Her parents . - Anyone else ? - The hall monitors . - Anyone else ? You ask that question a lot . Is there anything else you want to tell me ? I don 't think I told you anything . Oh , okay . Can I go now ? I 'm done with grief counseling and I feel much better . Yeah . Please , go . Yo , John Doe . You 've got a visitor . Those hurt ? Sometimes they crank those tight before they bring you in here . That way you might ask me to loosen them up and I 'm able to accommodate you in that . It 's a trick they do . It gives us a connection . But we already got a connection . Your prints are everywhere . Oven , light switch , toilet , safe . Wasn 't us who found it . But somebody did . After police thought they cleared the scene somebody came back and emptied the safe right quick . Didn 't force it either . They knew the combination . So we 've got you running from the scene of Andrew Goode 's murder . And we 've got you living at , and disappearing from and most likely returning to , the scene of these three murders . All of which would be a prosecutorial bounty . But I 've also got forensic evidence linking this to this . And this . Feeling connected yet ? What is it ? Hm ? The forensic evidence linking all these people . What is it ? Blood . Not my blood ? No , not your blood . And technically , not even blood . Some kind of synthetic . Come on , man , help me out . Tell me something I don 't know . We 're all gonna die . Yeah . I want him out of local custody today . He has more to say , and I want him on federal turf when he says it . Yes , this is Cameron 's mother . Mrs. Baum , you 're aware of the recent tragedy we 've had here at school ? - Jordan somebody . - Cowan . When I spoke to Cameron about it , she seemed strangely unaffected . I 'm sure you 're doing all you can as a parent . It 's been overwhelming for all of us . First with the tornado and then the move . Tornado ? I 'm sorry , she didn 't mention that . That might explain what I think might be classic posttraumatic stress . You 're gonna have to speak up . You shouldn 't be here . - I know who you are . - And I know who you are . Who else but Sarah Connor would have burned down that poor kid 's house ? It was you , wasn 't it , on Andy 's porch that night ? You 've been watching . You wanted to kill him , the poor kid . And you did . I didn 't do it . All I wanted was the Turk . Somebody else killed him and took the machine . - What ? - He was dead when I got there . He was dead and the Turk was gone , and I hoped you 'd done it . - You thought I killed him ? - But you 're here . And the Turk is out there . So we both failed . You gotta get out of here . If you haven 't figured it out , I have a T-triple-8 on my ass . Now , if you found me , it will too . - We should get you out . - Go . Find the partner of the Russian . He 's gotta be neck deep in this . - You 're dead in here . - Go . Please . I won 't be the bastard who brings metal down on the Connors , so go . You 're prettier than your picture . Picture ? Yeah , it 's actually how I clocked you . - My brother carried your snap for luck . - Who 's your brother ? What does it matter ? You don 't know the Reese boys and you never will . - Reese boys ? - Derek Reese . Brother 's Kyle . When John sent Kyle Reese back to protect me we had two days together . He told me about the future about the apocalypse and the terror of a world run by machines . Kyle Reese saved my life . He gave me a son . He never told me that he had a brother . He never told me we would have family that , in our grief , we are not alone . Cheri . - Cheri . - Walk away . John , please . Lock and key , bro . Lock and key . - Mom 's here . - Whoa . Hi , I 'm Morris . You 're brother 's new best friend . - Cameron . - Nice grip . Watch yourself . I 'm just looking out for you . - Field trip . - I call shotgun . I call 9 mm . What 's the ETA on my prisoner ? All right . - Drop it . Now . Run . - Easy , easy . You stay close . Take the jeep and follow us . - Metal bitch . - She 's on our side . Triple-8 . Lose him . - Let 's go . - Where 's Cameron ? - Leave her . Let 's go . - Let 's go . Stay back . Get down . Bring me the toolbox . Switchblade . Pliers . - Do something , we have to help . - Don 't let that thing touch me . - We have to stop you bleeding . - Get away . Please don 't move , you 're increasing your blood loss . - I can 't fix it . - You took a bullet out of me . He has internal damage . He needs medical attention or he 's gonna die . - A stun gun . Are you nuts ? - He needs a doctor . So you 're just gonna go kidnap one ? There 's an ER a mile away . It 's almost dark . - Mom , this is crazy , even for you . - We have to save him . - What happens when you get caught ? - We have to . - You don 't even know who this guy is . - He 's your uncle . He doesn 't know . He 's your father 's brother . His name 's Derek Reese . John . Two females . Approximately 5 ' 6 " , 120 pounds overpower you and your partner ambush your secure vehicle and kidnap my prisoner . Is that an accurate summation of what happened out here today , officer ? Yeah . Five-six . Five-six . If there is a flaw in chess as a game of war , it is this : Unlike war , the rules of chess are constant . The pieces unchangeable . You will never win the heart of a rook or the mind of a knight . They are deaf to your arguments , and so be it . The goal of a chess game is total annihilation . But in war , even as the blood beats in your ears and you race after your enemy , there is the hope that saner minds than yours will stop you before you reach your target . In war , unlike chess , rules can be changed . Truces can be called . The greatest of enemies can become the best of friends . Derek ? Derek ? He 's not breathing . Reese . Reese . In war , there is hope .

 My name is jane vasco . I could use you on my team . I work for a secret government agency that hunts neuros . People who can do dangerous things with their minds . On my first assignment ... Something a little weird happened , okay , something really weird . Until i get some answers i 'm getting on with my life , doing my job . Stocking up on aspirin , because let me tell ya , pain 's a bitch ! Make it stop ! Make it stop ! Make it stop ! Make it stop ! We 've got a problem here ! Make it stop ! Make it stop ! What are you waiting for ? Not here . Not in this house . Make it stop ! This is special field agent leslie jackson . Put me through to cooper . Coop , it 's lj . Whatever it is with this damn house ... It looks like it 's starting all over again . What the hell is your problem ? A daily ritual . Cleansing ourselves . We wash our hair , our bodies , our hands and our teeth . But with all the lotions , soaps and shampoos , none of it seems to reach below the surface . So we do our best to cover up whatever we 're trying to hide . But with so much concealed , ... i often wonder what it will be like when it cracks . And what lies underneath comes rushing out , unable to be contained . A shot of confidence , i 'm out the door to face neuros , pain and unanswered questions about my special condition . Seventeen maiden lane . In the dunbar district . It 's an odd little place . On the market for years . odd , you mean haunted . When it wouldn 't sell , the f.b.i. Picked it up for a song and reprovisioned it as a safe house . Since that time , four year ago there have been several " incidents . " what exactly is an " incident ? " show up at my place tonight and i 'll demonstrate . Oh , you mean a minor incident . Oh . Several witnesses being held at the location experienced some sort of mental breakdown . So much for " safe " house . None of the effects were permanent . The victims all recovered shortly after leaving the premises . The bureau 's been thorough . They 've pretty much eliminated most of the obvious . Radon . Mold . Gasses . All of it ... Eliminated . So , now the press has this story . Senator moreland is requesting a special committee to investigate the bureau 's handling of suspects and witnesses . They think the bureau 's responsible ? The f.b.i. Has been accused of using drugs and " mind control " tactics to get people to talk . When they don 't give people the answers , they will fill in the blanks . Think there 's any truth to it ? My contacts at the bureau say no . So obviously no one scanned for neuros . Obviously , until now . ) if we are dealing with a neuro , we 're gonna have to consider proximity . Riley 's downloaded the city zoning maps . We 've eliminated all the surrounding neighbors . Well , I got a map for the entrances to the main sewer lines , if that helps . Alight , you guys cover inside . We 'll take the perimeter . Just in case something goes bump in the night you 'll be outside so i have nothing to fear . Did you feel something ? Yeah , a draft . Upstairs or down ? Up . I 'll check down here . Basements . Mom ? Nothing out on the perimeter , anything here ? Uh , no . Not that I can find . Where 's maureen ? She 's downstairs . You alright ? Yeah , yeah , i 'm fine . and ... and that 's when you came up behind me . And ... whatever it was that I saw ... Wasn 't . What do you mean ? The room was ... as it was as it was when i first came into it . Why didn 't you tell me this on site ? I was a little freaked out at the time . a-and I didn 't know what the hell was going on . Do you know now ? No . But i know what i saw . Ok so the woman that you saw , did you see her face ? No , no . It all happened so fast , and ... She was gone . Is this her ? Picked these up off of nsa 's satellites . This was time-stamped when the last f.b.i. " incident " occurred . No , that 's not her . I thought you said you didn 't see her face . Yeah . I didn 't but ... I 'm just saying the coloring and the shape , it 's , it 's not ... sue me , alright ? It 's not the woman i saw ! Anyways , i 'm running her against the facial recognizance database . Nothing so far . She might 've been just passer by . Almost makes you start believing in ghosts . Well , whatever is going on in that house and we 're not going to solve it from down here . Boss , if you give me another day ... No , the FBI is under a lot of pressure . Hope you didn 't make plans for this weekend . Pack for a few days . We 're moving in . I told you what i saw . I don 't know why it warrants a special interrogation . Is that what you think this is ? It 's what it feels like . Given everything you told me , i have the distinct impression that you haven 't told me everything . I told you what i saw . But there 's more , isn 't there ? What you saw meant something to you . Yeah , maybe that i was losing my mind . It 's so simple , just tell me what you 're not telling me . I 'm pretty good at reading my people . Well , maybe you should try reading one of these . Because you 're certainly not doing a very good job reading me . You 're off the case , jane . What ? Why ? Because i believe whatever you saw in that house affected you deeply . So deeply you can scarcely talk about it , and that makes you unreliable . Hey , i 'm the one that heals and recovers quickly , remember ? Only on the outside . Get some rest . You 're sitting this one out . the kitchen 's fully stocked if anyone 's hungry . This feel to you guys like one of those movies where everybody goes in the old house and nobody survives because they all just get ... Riley , whatever 's going on in this house has a rational explanation . Yeah ... That 's exactly what the scientist always says . You know what , he 's also always wrong . We secure here ? Just have to finish up in the basement . Then do it . That 's great , just great . Sure , riley , we need you on site . Why don 't you just go down to the basement set up some wires and die . Great idea . Thanks andre . These guys ever watch movies ? Who the heck goes down into the basement alone ? ! The first guy to get it , that 's who ! Nothing down here , that 's good . That 's easy , that 's easy . It 's fine , it 's fine , it 's fine ... The spirit of a dead child . The spirit of a dead child . That 's the worst . That 's always the worst . Security breach in the kitchen , security breech ! I 'm on it , backdoor . It 's okay . I don 't eat much . We 're a team , mcbride . If you think it 's worthy of a court martial , go for it . But i 'm in . Every entry and exit is covered . If anyone comes in or leaves ... They 'll activate the alarm . These clasps will keep any of us from activating the system . We 'll work the " buddy system . " two to a room , one on watch . Do we get to draw straws for our buddy ? Riley , you 're on first watch . Great ! It 's always the second guy that gets it . If you see or hear anything ... I know ... Just scream . It won 't be too difficult . God . On a serious note , i pulled an i.d. On that woman who was in front of the house when the f.b.i. Agent lost it . Anna robeson . She 's been near or around this house since the incidents began . This is the first image i have of her at this site , captured four years ago . But this man , her husband , karl robeson . Protected witness ? If he was , the bureau claims to know nothing about it . I mean , I 've been through their database . I can 't find one record , not one that he was ever brought here or held in custody . You think the bureau 's covering up ? Or someone on it . Riley , give me a closer look here . Mean something to you ? It might . Riley , what else do you have on karl robeson ? The guy is off the radar completely . All i could come up with is that he did time at havenhurst for grand theft auto . You have a local for anna robeson ? Still working on a current address . I mean ... I don 't know if she 's indigent or what , i 'm striking out . So the broad 's a neuro . Could be . You find anything else on anna robeson , you let me know right away . Yeah , of course . Okay , people . Let 's turn in . Nighty night , don 't let the bed bugs bite . Good night . Good night . Don 't let the bed bugs bite . You sure this is the right way , lieutenant ? The map says east , lieutenant . Yeah , the map says east , lieutenant . I think you got this one wrong , boss . Should of checked the map . Should have checked the map . I checked the ... NNoooo ! Side servant 's entrance ! Alright , what do we got ? Side entrance breech . Send connor ... They 're already on it . Okay . You alright ? Yeah ! Look what we found sneaking around outside . Anna robeson . Why are you here , mrs . Robeson ? Why do you keep coming back to this house ? Because my husband ... Because karl is here . There 's no one here besides us . The day those two men came to take karl ... I followed them . They brought him to this house . I never saw karl after they brought him here . They said that they were investigating him about a kidnapping . Karl would never hurt anyone . The f.b.i. Disagreed . Karl was different . And he worked for the people who lost their daughter . But if you knew him ... What do you mean " different ? " it 's hard to explain . Try . He could take my hand ... And instantly , i 'd experience what karl was feeling . Joy , pain , sorrow ... Even anger . Husbands and wives often have those feelings of being connected . I know what you 're thinking . But this was different . And it wasn 't just with me . I remember once when we were out together ... It was a beautiful , wonderful day . We came across a homeless man , asking for money . But one look in his eyes , you could see that his life was lacking more than money . Karl handed the man five dollars . But he held onto his hand for a moment . You could see the change immediately . It was as if this man lit up inside ... His hope was restored . Karl gave that to him . It 's beautiful . This son of a bitch sounds like a chip candidate to me . Karl would never hurt someone 's child . Or anyone . Mrs. Robeson ... I 'm afraid you 're going to have to spend the night here . We 're in the middle of an investigation and right now ... You 're a suspect . I know why you 're here . The things that have happened in this house . Karl is here . Maureen , would you be so kind as to take mrs . Robeson up to your room . Keep an eye on her . Well , we know she 's telling the truth about her husband being brought here . Why would the bureau lie about that ? That 's something we 'll have to find out . I want every scrap of information you can give me on karl robeson . You gotta consider that broad has been around this place every time something bad has gone down . That 's right . Why risk it ? I say we chip her and ship her . I do not believe that she is our neuro . E.s.p. ? No , she was right here with us . She could have had any one of us at any time . Why take the chance ? ! Why risk it ? Because i think she knows something . Something she 's not telling us . Jane , would you mind going upstairs , help maureen keep an eye on that woman . If you 're right and she 's not a neuro , what she said about her husband ... How when he touched people ... I know . Yeah . Had enough of connor as a roomie ? Just wanted some time to myself . You want to talk about it ? Not really . Sounds like you do . What 'd you see ? Saw enough to help me understand part of what 's going on in this house . Which is ? Which is specific to the individual . Whatever he or she fears most . I 've been going over the documented cases in my mind . It was a woman . The last woman , she was supposed to be a witness in an organized crime case ... A hemophobic ... That means she fears of blood ... She saw blood coming out of the walls . An agent , arachnophobic . Could have sworn he saw scorpions crawling out from under the bed covers . And you ? I saw men ... Under my command ... Dying . because I made a mistake . Something from your past ? Not specifically . But something i live with every day . You can 't take responsibility for what happens to us . You don 't believe a word of that . You know if you were leading this team , you would feel exactly the same as i do . You still haven 't told me what you saw . I 'm not sure i understand it . Enough to support my theory ? When i know , i 'll let you know . What are you doing here ? How did you find me ? What do you want ? ! What do you want ? ! No ! no sign of connor upstairs . And mrs . Robeson ? Apparently slept through the night . No , i 've checked the entire basement and the outside . When was the last time anyone saw connor ? Last night when we took mrs . Robeson upstairs . You try his comm ? Nothing . Did an ultrasound sweep . Come on , people ! Well , where the hell did he go ? He didn 't just vanish into thin air ! I got him . Picked up connor 's comm set via gps . Can you force a connect ? I could do that while i was still in diapers . You 're hot . Connor . You already know what it 's like to sleep in a four by six cinder block room . You gunning to go back ? I 'm here , what 's up ? What 's up ? Isn 't that my question ? Technically , you 're awol . Now , I want to know why . Because hanging around that house , waiting for ghostly apparitions to appear is a waste of time . That 's my call . ) well , i made my own . I can do a lot more in the field than i can hanging around that house , tucked in with the rest of you . I think the old broad was onto something . There 's something i need to check out . You saw something in the house . What did you see ? Connor ! Damn ! I lost him . He 's off the map . I 'm making a fresh pot . Dr. Carpenter should be here in about an hour to pick you up for analysis . What is it you people are afraid of ? We just want him to check you out , make sure you 're in good health . You 're a bad liar , miss bowers . But whatever it is you want me to do , i 'll do . Maureen ! I 've got something . I 'll be right back . Is everything alright ? What ? Hey , mo , not tomorrow . Now ! Miss bowers . Miss bowers . Everything alright ? Bowers . You alright ? What 's wrong ? Maureen ? Andre ! You okay ? No , i feel like i 'm losing my mind . It 's alright . It 's just the house . Mom ? I thought you were at school . I don 't go to school anymore . I 'm grown up now . This is always my favorite time . When i have the house to myself . Your father 's gone and you 're gone . And i get to be alone . You like being alone ? It gives me time to think . What do you think about ? I think about you . And wonder what 's so wrong about you . I don 't understand . Can you imagine what it 's like to have a child ... A beautiful child .. Only to find yourself frightened by the very thing you love the most ? You 're frightened by me ? You were never like the other children . Even before you could talk , i knew you were different . All the dreams we had for a child only to discover that i was the mother of a freak . Jane . Tell me what you saw . I don 't wantto talk about it . It isn 't real . Whatever you saw , it 's this house . It 's not real . Some wounds don 't heal so quickly . I understand . But maureen 's right . This house has a way of getting inside us . The fear is real ... What you saw is not . Is there any difference ? Yes . We can conquer ... Or at least learn to live with our fears . I 'll be alright . I never doubted it . yeah , yeah ... I 'll let him know . Connor 's coming in . He says he 's got something . And he 's bringing it here for show and tell . Jane ... Before you freaked ... I mean before what happened ... What did you touch ? What 're you talking about ? What 'd did you touch ? Did you plug something in ? Turn on a light switch ? I don 't know . I suppose i turned on the light . Why ? Andre ? I was making some notes ... I turned off the light and went to bed . I was in the kitchen with anna making coffee . Is everything all right ? I knew it ! I knew it ! I am right again ! I am right again ! You going to have a parade for yourself or tell us what 's going on ? I just confirmed with connor . That his mp 3 player plugged in and he was listening to music . Wow , that really explains it riley . Don 't you see , Whatever it is ... it is in the electricity , in the circuitry of the house . So it seemed brilliant to ask , how come whatever is in here didn 't touch me ? I mean , with all my equipment plugged in , the drawing power . There had to be a logical explanation . Look at this . Come here . Andre and jane were upstairs when whatever happened , happened . But me and connor ... I 'm getting to that . The light switch in jane 's room , the lamp in andre 's , the outlet connor used , they all work on the same circuit . The house was re-modelled at some point and there was too much power to draw from one circuit so they split it off . The coffee machine works on the same damn circuit . Except for this room and my gear . Riley , you 're out on a pretty big limb with this . Think about it . Why does chipping work on neuros ? Because neurological activity is ... Electrical . Exactly . The chip can interferes or shortcircuit a connection in the brain . All the wiring goes to a breaker box located in the basement . Hell , guys , it 's worth a look . Okay ... It should be here , right along this wall . It 's hollow . It 's just painted drywall . It looks like a door that 's been boarded up . Help me get this thing out of the way . Alright , get back . Whoa . Different circuit . What do you make of this ? It 's an interrogation room . Crude , but familiar . I see you found camp 's playground . This is russell camp . Assistant special agent in charge of the northeast division of the f.b.i. Who are you people ? I thought i told you that we 're asking the questions . Alright connor , what 's going on ? I saw something last night . Something from my past . Someone i hurt . Which helped me rember who this piece of garbage was . You know him ? I know of him . When i was in the joint , cops would be investigated by the bushel . Campy here was working local p.d. And was accused of some very bad things . What kind of things ? Let 's just say that his interrogation techniques were ... Unconventional . This is the agents who brought anna 's husband to this house . He and his partner , dwight elkins . Why lie about it ? Isn 't it obvious ? He and elkins wanted to get away from f.b.i. Headquarters so they could conduct their interrogations so no eyebrows would be raised . A five-year old girl was missing . We didn 't know if she was dead or alive . Robeson wanted to lawyer up . So you tortured him . We were trying to extract information . Alright ... What happened ? He said he didn 't know anything about the kidnapping and we let him go . Look at this ! You better talk , you son of a bitch ! There was a girl 's life at stake , for godsake ! Here we go . Alright ! Alright ! Nobody ... Nobody thought anything was going to happen to him , ok ? We roughed him up a little . Dwight gave him a jolt from the charger . Nobody knew his heart was going to stop . We didn 't know . So you killed him ? He died , yeah . You and elkins ... You got rid of the body , walled the place up , you didn 't tell the f.b.i. That you 'd even questioned the man . They ended up catching the kidnappers . Two weeks later . Still had the kid with him . Robeson had nothing to do with it . Given your future , he might 've made the right choice . Connor , call the f.b.i. And tell them to pick up this piece of garbage . Congratulations , pal , you are first in line for the senate investigation committee . I love you , anna . Everything anna robeson described about her husband , how he could pass on his moods and emotions ... Sound like a neuro to me ? Alright , let 's say he was . So in his last moment , he 's electrocuted . All his pain , his fear , his last emotions ... All which are brain activity ... And electrical ... Passed into the circuitry of this house . So you 're saying the house is a neuro ? I don 't know . But it seems everyone who came in contact with that circuit seemed to experience their own pain and fear ... As if karl robeson was still able to transmit emotion . So what ? You 're saying we should chip the house ? This is nuts . You have a better explanation ? Wait , at the end ... That wasn 't camp 's voice . I 'll bet even money that whatever was wrong with this house , isn 't wrong anymore . Carl robeson escaped this house through camp , the man who killed him . Alright , are you willing to put your money where your mouth is ? Yes , i am . Let 's go . Follow me . After you . Keep talking . Alright , you fill my wallet . You just turned it on , right ? Flicked the switch . Alright . Oh , no ! Oh God ! Oh God ! Anything but that ! Riley ! Anything but that ! What is it ? What 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? It 's ... It 's decaf ! I hate decaf . I will get you for that . I 'm sorry . A president once said , " we have nothing to fear but fear itself . " andre , one of the strongest men i know , admitted his fear to me . Even maureen admitted her fear of losing control , i think my greatest weakness is the fear that i 'll be seen as weak . But i have to wonder , if the vulnerable aren 't the strong . And if those who wear their strength like a shield , the weak and frightened . Hey . I think i am ready to talk . Come on in .

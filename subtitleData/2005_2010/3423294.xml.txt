There are a lot of photographs on your wall . Who are they ? That is , the fourth generation . the fourth generation ? The fourth generation . That one , is my grandpa . Your grandpa ? He was of a different time , like the bubble economy , Each night , everyone got together to party , Back then , he had 50 maids ! And now ? This generation ? doesn 't have any maids , none . Even when they are single , What are the wages like ? People have no concept of circumstances . So , for now , I just try to enjoy myself . A month goes by so quickly . My wage is barely enough to survive . Soon , I 'll have to rob banks to support myself . All I can do is use my talent to make money . Why were they more popular before ? Maybe , because of the quantity of the monsters . How can I put this ... Today , this industry is very quiet , now one must rely on far fewer monsters . And there 's much less creativity , Much less . The monsters just don 't appear as often now . They were better organised ? Back in those days . It really was a golden time ( age ) . Or so it seemed . Nowadays it 's all dead . It 's shown at a late hour , Too late for most ... Yes , the ' dead ' hour Yes . 1 million viewers ? I remember when we reached 2 million ! The viewers will come back , I 'm sure . I don 't know . Where do you go from here ? It 's all changing . I hear that the monsters are all in the central region . There are a lot of electricity wires there . I really want to go to there . How many places are left in this country ? Nowadays , We are running out of places left to fight in . But , we still have the castle of 8 Princes , that hasn 't been used for a while . Always historical sites ? At the beginning of the century we had 52 places to fight . 52 places ? In all . More choice . What can you do to change things , to improve the ratings ? Some people say you are a monster ? Yes , I am a monster . The general term is ' monster I am fine , with this . A ' monster ' to me is not always a bad thing . We must choose our words carefully , Today we can use this word freely , The conotations aren 't so bad . Yes , a ' monster ' . During the old times , people didn 't think like they do today . I am sure of that . Are you sure ? Really ? So you say ... It 's depends on how you think about it . How do you feel about working for the military ? Your opinions ? Well , This doesn 't interest me at all . I occasionally hear comments , but I take no notice . What I do is a tradition , from ancient times . It is certainly very complex The end result is that , monsters and humans resist each other . Only when one of them is dying do the humans or monsters understand the other culture I have no hatred of humans Are you scared of anyone ? Uncertainty scares me , or this new generation ! We are just products now . Last of the things that cannot be controlled . Todays generation just wants to clean up everything . The children ? The children ... Yes , the children I am not so sure . Can we come in ? Bear with me , Just wait here a moment . Okay . I am the ' King of Pain' That ... crew is filming me , Can you let them in ? He says it 's okay ... Hello . Hello .

He was more solemn before . He is changing , For quite a while now , Yes , a while . The ceremony must be done right . How do you know if it 's allright ? Well , what I mean is , as he grows - he changes . He 's very unpredictable . Does he transform here ? Not always ... From time to time . Does he prefer it here ? It must be done correctly ? That is vital . Are you scared ? Does he worry you sometimes ? No ... because they are a good team . Sorry , Sorry , can you start again ? Okay . Okay , ready now . Sorry ! The beginning ... I am ready . Please stand back . Do you think he is cursed ? Cursed ? A curse is something ... that doesn 't have a positive meaning . I 'd say it 's a ... gift . It 's hard to say , Go on ... A curse ... A curse ... can be used to serve justice also . His heart is honest . Who said it was a curse ? Well , we all have our own personal viewpoint . Everyone thinks that they are usually right . I thinks that that he is a man of justice , but , what exactly is justice ? In todays world , these definitions become blurred . What is life ? Your life ? My life ? Whose so-called life is the standard ? it 's all a process . My own life is here life still ... from generation to generation we continue the last one , that progression is ' life To say that the ones self is the only life ? Or death ... Will only I die , when I close my eyes for the last time ? This is very important . Which one is more important is another matter . But if I compare death to life , then life is certainly the most important . Life is hard , People get die all the time . To ignore it is foolish , It 's all we have . Animals also think in this kind of way Even monsters ... He must find a safe landing spot before he jumps down . If he is successful he will prosper . This is the survival mentality that drives the monster . Please do not cover your chest . What a hero ! What a hero ! . It 's starting ... Thanks Thanks It 's starting , Does the ' King of Pain ' come here often ? Yes , when his schedule allows . He drops in . Sorry , what is your relation to him ? Me ? Just a friend . We were childhood friends . We have known each other for so long now . This is the true test of friendship . What do you think of his work ? It 's very tiring . I 've seen him grow , and transform into the giant . it looked so painful ! A lot of people let fame go to their head , But not him . He always wants to please and help others . Ms Mulberry , How old are you ? What do you think , Guess how old ? 30 ... s 30 's ? ! You divided in two ! It doesn 't matter whether you know or not , Just don 't say I am 20 years old Age is important to a woman . I 'm sorry . Ms Mulberry , are you coming too ? Come with me , right ? I should slap you !

Your grandpa can be difficult ? It 's tough to feed him , or give him his medicine . When he was younger he took a lot of different drugs . Maybe more pressure from society ? How did your father die ? Very tragically , my father died when he was still very young . His death came about ... because he ... wanted to be bigger . but he over-worked himself ... and died abruptly . His generation was different , in the fourth generation the elder of the house couldn 't connect with their sons . They reminded them of the ageing process . Well , that 's my guess . Do you think everything is bigger now ? Can we deny it ? We sometimes forget the consequences , which are bigger problems . as a result ... intelligence is slipping away . Our brains are bigger . No . Hello . - Your Grandpa has escaped . He fled the hospital Tokyo Tower Under Attack ! What do you think ? This is ... this is a problem of the fourth generation The generations are irrelevant .

That 's why you are the manager ! Me ? The fourth generation ? You are also the fourth generation ? What exactly is ' fourth generation ' ? How can you do nothing ? People don 't understand my position . Your position ? People just want a little peace and quiet . I work hard . In this business , the sponsors keep us going , from this month to the next . I want to stay in my job . I am not saying it like that . You missunderstand me . Please try and help me . We 've been here before , it 's just like the last time . Believe me , I know . You sure about what you are saying ? The sponsors will drop out . Can you promise me they won 't ? I said that I am sure . Somehow , you need to do something . I 'm not doing anything ! I told you . Don 't get angry with me . There is nothing to do ! That is my policy . Just ignore what other people say . I trust you to do the same . Remember this you 'll be a good manager .

He was weak then ? Yes , I saw the fight ! Compared to the other monster , he was right to run . He would have been beaten . I agree . He still needs to grow up a little . He should be more serious . I was dissappointed . The ' King of Pain ' needs cheering up ... Yes , sounds right ... Certainly . He could be happier . Have you bought a new car ? I haven 't bought one yet . Why the delay ? You should get one . Well ... I want you to recommend one for me . I 'll have a look for you . What do you think of last night ... Our ratings went up like a shot . Running away wasn 't good though ? You are my Manager , Do you think that I ran away ? You escaped from a bad situation . You had no choice , no doubt about it . I am not a coward , In that moment ... it was all I could do . You saw it as well . You don 't have to be like everyone else , I hate nationalism . I know . Our great nation , Japan By order of the General ... will punish all big Japanese You know ...

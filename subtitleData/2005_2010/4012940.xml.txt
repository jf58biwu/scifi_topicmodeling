YOU 'LL THINK OF SOMETHING . HELLO . MY NAME IS SHAWN FARRELL , AND I AM ONE OF THE 4400 . UH , A FEW MONTHS AGO , I NEVER THOUGHT ANYONE WOULD EVER CLAP WHEN I SAID THAT . BUT WE DIDN 'T KNOW THEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW- - THE FUTURE OF MANKIND IS IN JEOPARDY , AND RIGHT HERE , WITH YOUR HELP , IS WHERE WE START TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT . IF YOU JOIN US HERE- - MR. COLLIER , MR. DRAVITT 'S HERE FOR YOU . THANK YOU . ... THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELVES . IAN . THANKS FOR FITTING ME IN . INTERESTING PLACE YOU GOT HERE . I 'M NOT GOING TO BE ABDUCTED BY ALIENS , AM I ? NO , IAN . THEY WEREN 'T ALIENS . THEY WERE FROM THE--FUTURE I KNOW.SO YOU 'VE TOLD ME , AD NAUSEUM . LOOK , IT 'S ALL THE SAME SIDESHOW TO ME . SO , HERE I AM . HERE YOU ARE . WHAT SAY WE GET DOWN TO BUSINESS ? IAN DRAVITT . FOUNDER AND CEO OF EXECUTIVE PROJECTIONS , A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION BASED IN ZIMBABWE . YOUR COMPANY WANTS TO DO BUSINESS IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY , THEY 'LL SHOW YOU THE LAY OF THE LAND . IT 'S ALL PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE- - YEAH , ON THE SURFACE , BUT DRAVITT 'S REAL MONEY COMES FROM MERCENARY ACTIVITY AND ARMS DEALING . SOLD GRENADE LAUNCHERS TO THE I.R.A. , WHITE PHOSPHORUS LANDMINES TO THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS IN PERU ... SO WHAT 'S HE SELLING TO COLLIER ? GOOD QUESTION , BUT OUR OBSERVATION TEAMS CAN 'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT TIME COLLIER TAKES LUNCH . BEYOND THE LOBBY , THAT PLACE IS A MYSTERY . I MEAN , WE 'VE SENT OUR AGENTS IN DISGUISED AS AIR CONDITIONING GUYS , FIBER OPTICS REPAIRMEN- - YEAH , WE GET A BUG IN , IT 'S YANKED BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER . PROBABLY SWEEPING THE PLACE EVERY FEW HOURS . AS FAR AS COLLIER 'S POW-WOWS WITH DRAVITT ... ALL WE CAN DO IS GUESS . YOU THINK HE 'S STOCKPILING WEAPONS ? OH , ARMS , ANTHRAX- - NOTHING WOULD SURPRISE ME . I MEAN , COLLIER 'S ALL BUT SAID HE 'S AT WAR WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT . COULD BE LAYING DOWN A DEFENSE PERIMETER AROUND THE CENTER .

TWO HOMERS , TWO SINGLES , AND A DOUBLE . THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT- - YEAH , IT WAS GREAT WHEN IT STARTED , BUT I CAN 'T CONTROL IT . FIRST , IT WAS EVERYONE ON THE TEAM , AND THEN EVERYONE IN THE STANDS , AND THEN , I DON 'T KNOW , IT WAS JUST ... JUST EVERYONE . IT 'S LIKE THIS OCEAN OF NOISE CRASHING AROUND IN MY HEAD . I WANT SOMEONE TO MAKE IT GO AWAY . THAT 'S WHAT I WANT . I WAS THIS CLOSE ... TO MAKING IT TO THE MAJORS WHEN I GOT SNATCHED . THIS TIME , I 'M GONNA MAKE IT . I HAVE TO MAKE IT . WHAT , SO NAVARRO IS REALLY SOME KIND OF MIND READER ? I BELIEVE " TELEPATH " IS THE WORD YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR . WELL , CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE IF THE WORD MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE , BUT THE GUY DEFINITELY KNEW WHAT WE WERE THINKING . INTERESTING GIFT . I COULD THINK OF A FEW PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS FOR IT . DR. OSTMAN GAVE HIM SOME HALOPERIDOL . IT CALMED HIM DOWN , QUIETED THE NOISE SOME . SO HE CAN FUNCTION AS LONG AS HE 'S ON ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDS ? WE DON 'T HAVE TO FIT HIM FOR ANY STRAITJACKET , BUT HE 'S NOT GOING TO BE HITTING ANY KNUCKLEBALLS EITHER , WHICH IS ALL HE WANTS TO DO . YEAH , I 'LL PUT NTAC MEDICAL ON IT .

WELL , WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT COLLIER AND IAN DRAVITT ARE UP TO . A 4400 WHO CAN READ MINDS JUST WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR . YOU WANT TO USE NAVARRO AS A MOLE ? IS THAT EVEN LEGAL ? MM-HMM . D.C. CLEARED IT . WELL , HOW ABOUT ETHICAL ? GUY 'S ASKING US FOR HELP . HELL , HE 'S EVEN BEGGING US . AND WE 'LL HELP HIM . BUT HE 'S GOT TO HELP US FIRST . WHAT IF HE SAYS NO ? THEN YOU 'LL GET HIM TO SAY YES . EXCUSE ME . CAN WE GET ONE MORE BLANKET ? THE ONE WE HAVE IS KIND OF THIN .

YEAH , BUT WE DO KNOW THAT COLLIER THINKS HE 'S HEADED TOWARDS A CONFLICT WITH SOMEONE NTAC , THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT , I DON 'T KNOW . HE INSTALLS A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT IN SAO TOME . IT COULD HAVE BEEN A PLACE TO GO WHEN THINGS HEAT UP . WHAT , LIKE A HOMELAND FOR THE 4400 ? TOO BAD YOU CAN 'T PROSECUTE A MAN FOR DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR . THEY 'RE NOT DELUSIONS IF YOU CAN MAKE THEM COME TRUE . WE 'RE ALWAYS ONE STEP BEHIND COLLIER BECAUSE WE KEEP SEEING HIM AS SOME KIND OF CULT NUT . WHAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING OURSELVES IS , BEFORE COLLIER WAS ABDUCTED , DID HE EVER SET HIS MIND TO SOMETHING AND ... NOT GET IT DONE ? THEY DIDN 'T MAKE HIM ANY DUMBER IN THAT BALL OF LIGHT . WELL , ANYWAY , WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT COLLIER WAS THINKING . GARY FOUND OUT FOR US . TIME TO TURN HIM OVER TO NTAC MEDICAL , RIGHT ? SOON . " SOON " ? THE NSA IS CC 'D ANY TIME WE REGISTER A NEW 4400 ABILITY . THEY HAVE BEEN LEANING ON D.C. TO BORROW GARY FOR AN OP THEY 'VE GOT PLANNED . NO- - NO MORE CLOAK-AND-DAGGER STUFF . HE 'LL SIT IN ON A FEW CONFERENCES . YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH DIPLOMATS . THEY DON 'T ALWAYS SAY WHAT THEY THINK . THAT WASN 'T THE AGREEMENT I MADE WITH HIM . BUT TERMS HAVE CHANGED . GARY 'S TOO VALUABLE . I GAVE HIM MY WORD . YOU 'RE TURNING ME INTO A LIAR . YOU 'VE BEEN IN THE GAME ALMOST 20 YEARS . MY GUESS IS , YOU 'VE COMMITTED ALL THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS , JUST LIKE THE REST OF US . I SHOULD HAVE LET HIM STAY WITH COLLIER . HE MIGHT HAVE USED HIM , BUT HE WOULD 'VE HELPED HIM TOO . DON 'T YOU EVER USE ME AGAIN . ALL I WANTED WAS TO PLAY BALL . YOU GUYS PROMISED TO HELP , BUT YOU CAN 'T DO THAT , CAN YOU ? WE 'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE 4400 . IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKE THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT US . YOU KNOW THAT BAR , MEL 'S ? CORNER OF LANCASTER AND THIRD ? YOU FEEL LIKE JOINING ME ? WE DON 'T GO TO BARS . WELL , I 'M GOING TONIGHT , WITH YOU OR WITHOUT YOU .

 Previously on Heroes . Sword not there . Original owned by man named Linderman . He 's a client of mine . Get your car . You 're going back to Vegas . You 're going home . The charges against you have been dropped , Miss Sanders . And as far as Linderman is concerned ? Don 't worry about tomorrow 's problems today . Officer Parkman , we 're enforcing a six-month suspension . We 're gonna need your gun and your badge . Nothing in my life has been real . My dad obviously doesn 't work in a paper factory . He 's gone now . You 're okay . This is my friend . He 's gonna make everything okay . Mom ? Claire ? I was hoping you could tell me about my father . Now , that 's complicated . He 's kind of a big shot . Hello ? You might not remember me . We haven 't spoken in a long time , but I just had ... Our daughter just found me . Did you hear what I just said ? She 's alive . Meredith ? We need to talk . Nathan , are you still there ? It 's been 14 years . I went to your funeral . Look , that fire , it wasn 't an accident . Someone was out to get me , and the police , they just assumed I was dead , so I ran . And our daughter ? Well , she 's got an angel on her shoulder , that one . She was adopted by a nice family here in Texas . She 's 16 now . She 's beautiful . She 's got blonde hair like me , and she is smart just like you . Maybe one day she 'll run for Congress . The timing of your call two weeks before my election , that 's not a coincidence , is it ? A child born out of wedlock , that 's big news . You wouldn 't want that to come out . Ruin things for you . How much do you want ? Oh ... A hundred thousand ? Yeah . That ought to cover it . I 'll let you know where to send it . Nice and easy . Mom , are you okay ? I 've been better . Oh , she 'll be fine . She needs a little rest , little time to recover . Recover from what ? She had an appointment with a neurologist , who ran some tests . What kind of tests ? Your mother 's been having some headaches . Yeah , she 's also been having some memory loss . Did you tell them that ? Of course , Claire . I 'm handling it . Don 't worry , honey . I 'll be fine . Mr. Muggles isn 't worried , is he ? No , he 's not . D.L. Won 't be fooled . Sure , he will . Love is blind , and if last night is any indication he won 't be able to see anything for a long time . Nik , baby , I 've got to get going . I 'll be right there . Don 't you look all secret service . Is this standard issue for bodyguards ? Bodyguards ? We 're not called bodyguards anymore , honey , it 's private security . Whatever you want to call it , it 's paying the bills . Are we ever gonna talk about it ? Talk about what ? What we can do . Our powers . I just feel like we 're supposed to be fighting crime or something . That 's true . But for now , can you just have fun at school , my young genius ? Yep . All right , baby , there 's a package for you over on the table . Thanks . Are you taking your gun ? It 's the difference between 500 and 350 a day , my carry permit . You 're not gonna need it , though , right ? I 'm basically a glorified babysitter . Nothing 's gonna happen . I hope not . Thank God you called . Playing house was making me cranky . I understand . Guy stole his money . He wants him dead . What Mr. Linderman wants , Mr. Linderman gets . The white curb is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only . No parking . I 'm Malsky . Matt Parkman , here to protect you , sir . Bang . Excuse me ? Are you okay , miss ? Anything we can do to help ? No , I couldn 't possibly , I mean , we 're complete strangers . I 'm Ando . This is my friend Hiro . Hi . I 'm Hope . So , where we headed ? Diamond District , Broadway and Sixth . What a beautiful day to be in Los Angeles . Look at this weather . And the air ... What 's your name again ? Parkman , Matt Parkman . Listen , Parkman , the job is simple . You drive me downtown . We meet a man . I make a deal . Then you drive me back to the airport . You just make sure no one bothers me . That includes you . Hope this loser knows how to use his gun . Otherwise we 're both dead . My name 's Dr. Mohinder Suresh . It 's very important that I speak with him . I assure you my interest is legitimate . My name is Dr. Mohinder Suresh . It 's really rather complicated to explain over the phone . This is Dr. Mohinder Suresh . There 's a certain genetic trait . Hello ? Have you noticed anything unusual about his behavior ? My name is Dr. Mohinder Suresh . You still there ? One new message . Hi , this is Zane , Zane Taylor . Z-A-N-E Taylor . I got your phone message , and something 's happening to me . I can 't control it . I ... I think we need to talk . Please hurry . Can you come see me right away ? It 's really ... Five minutes , ladies . Five minutes . We 've dated for a few months . He lives in LA . Comes to visit . And , at first , he was really sweet . But now he 's just horrible . He even hit me once . Your boyfriend did this to you ? I 'm sorry . I left this morning while he was sleeping , and then I forgot my bag . It 's pink and it has rhinestones on it , and it 's got all my money and my credit cards . It even has my family photos in it . That I can 't replace . I should go up there and talk to him . Maybe he won 't be so mad . No . We will do it . Eh ? Excuse us , please . Hang on . Did you two say something about Mr. Linderman ? Yes . You know him ? No , not personally , but everybody knows who he is . I know people who do . That 's great . If we get your bag , can you introduce us ? Yeah , I can do that . We still have a problem . How do we get past security ? I have an idea . Who 's there ? Room service . I didn 't order room service . Complimentary , for high roller . Ah , very nice room . How are you today ? You 're done . Oh , God , hurry . Please hurry . Oh God , hurry . Hurry . Please hurry . Please hurry . Dr. Suresh ? Yes . Yes . Thank God . Come in . Come in . I was starting to think you weren 't gonna show . I didn 't know what I was gonna do . I mean , look at what I 'm living with . Yes , I see what you mean . I 'm just a regular guy . I mean , I 've never been different , or special . I mean , no one would even look at me twice walking down the street . I guess I should show you . Right ? What I do , you need to see it , right ? Yes , of course . I haven 't left the apartment for three weeks , I 'm going a little crazy . Maybe you should step back . It can get a little messy . We reap what we sow , Nathan . You have no one to blame but yourself . I 'll go down to Texas and handle it . So close to the election ? Don 't be ridiculous . If the press gets wind of this , especially on the heels of the Linderman scandal ... I cared about Meredith once . I owe her more than a phone call . I owe them both . Besides , I 'm this girl 's father , Mom . You 're a glorified sperm donor . Don 't get emotionally attached . How can you be so cold ? Because I know you , Nathan . Beneath the gruff exterior , you 're a sap . And the moment that young girl looks at you with those sad , little weepy eyes , you 're lost , you 're finished . You 'll start giving , she 'll start taking , until there 's nothing left . So prioritize , Nathan . Wire the money to Texas . Focus on the people who really matter . How 's Mom ? Your mother 's resting . So I understand you and Zach cut school yesterday . Mom said we could . It was for a report . We went to the aquarium . With these tickets ? Printed from your computer ? These fake tickets , Claire ? You 're spying on me ? I don 't know where you were , and I don 't want to know . You 're a teenager . You need to assert your independence , but this behavior is unacceptable . You 're grounded , young lady . You 're to be home everyday at 5 : 00 sharp , until further notice . What ? You can 't do that ! You have no right ! I 'm your father ! You 're not my real father . No , I 'm not . But I 'm as close as you 've got . So you 'll stay home at night until you earn our trust back . Hello ? Hi . It 's me , Claire . Do you have a second to talk about my father ? Oh , hey , Claire , I 'm glad you called . Talk about coincidence . I found your father . You 're kidding . What did he say ? Well , after he got over the shock that we were both alive , he was actually kind of sweet . Said he 'd be happy to help us out , sounded real generous , too . Says he 's gonna fly right down from New York . Well , I want to meet him . Oh , right , well , I don 't know about that . But he 's my father . Right , well , why don 't I talk to him , and we 'll see what he says ? You know what , Claire , I actually have to go , but I 'll call you later , all right ? I love you . I 've got the money . Let 's see the diamonds . Stones range from two to nine carats . My offer is more than generous . Not that it matters . Linderman 's guy will be here soon . You won 't get out alive . Sir , sir , please . We 've got to get out of here right now . This is a setup . What ? How do you know that ? I just do . You have to trust me . You 've got a deal . I gotta run . Who 's Linderman ? My ex-employer . How do you know his name ? Never mind . Why has he sent someone here to kill you ? Because I stole his two million . I should have been out of the country by now . Oh , great . You stole the money . How do you know ? Please , you 've gotta get me out of here . Take this . There 's another one for you when you get me out . No , no . You can 't bribe me . I don 't want to die . Two in the bodyguard . Then Malsky gets one in the gut . Two in the bodyguard , then Malsky gets one in the gut . She 's in there . This should be fun . I do all the work . He takes half the profit . I 'm sick of it . No , I got these two Chinese guys to help me out . Turned on the waterworks , and they were mine . Yep . They 're getting the suitcase as we speak . All right , I 'll catch the bus from Primm and meet you in Barstow . I love you , too , Leo . Oh , hi . I didn 't see you come in . You were on telephone . Uh , with my mom . So , where 's the bag ? We are not Chinese . We are Japanese . Whatever . Where 's the bag ? You are bad person . You may fool Ando , but you do not fool me . Thanks for the help , Sulu . What are you doing ? We can 't stop here . Back up . This way ! Come on ! Come on ! Go to the elevator . You can 't do this . You have to stop ! Don 't worry , Niki . I don 't plan on being Little Miss Homemaker forever . Just gotta lay low for a while . You 're chasing two men with a gun in broad daylight . You call that laying low ? This is my life , my child . You can 't do this . I have to . Somebody 's gotta repay Linderman . You made the deal to get me out of jail ? I couldn 't leave it up to you , now could I ? The elevator 's not coming ! Come on ! Who are you calling ? Back up . You can 't bring the cops into this ! Terry , hey , it 's Parkman . I 'm working security . Diamond District , Sixth and Broadway . I 've got a shooter , possibly two . Send everyone you 've got . Come on ! All right , you go to the other side of the building . Cops will be here soon . I 'll buy us some time . Drop your weapon . Over the side , right now . Okay , where 's your partner ? Partner ? Come on , your partner . I heard you arguing with her . Niki , right ? Where is she ? You heard Niki ? Where is she ? She 's probably killing Malsky . Right now . Fourth one over , third one back . Fourth one over , third one back . Fourth one over , third one back . Hey . There you are . Come on , let 's go ! Me again . What ? No ! No ! Claire ? What are you doing here ? I have to see my father . You don 't understand . I 'll wait here all night if I have to . Why don 't we take a walk ? It 's my mom , she 's sick , and I think it 's bad . Oh , I 'm so sorry . How can I help ? You said my father had money . You said he had power , and that he wanted to help us . I thought maybe he would give me ... Oh , honey , I didn 't mean that kind of help . I meant just money . I don 't understand . Your daddy , he 's ... How do I explain this ? When your daddy found out that I was pregnant with you ... What I 'm trying to say is that you can 't count on him . He 'll give us cash , because that 's easy , but anything else , he 'll just disappoint you . He doesn 't even want to meet me ? Oh , Claire , please . Why 'd you even tell me about him ? Because he wants to give us some money , $ 50,000 , and you 're entitled to half of that . I don 't want his money . I 'm heading back to Mexico for a while , so we 're probably not going to see each other . I want you to take real good care of yourself , okay ? Hang on . So I can remember that sweet face . Police ! Get your hands up ! I 'm on the job . I 'm on the job . Hello , Zane Taylor ? Yes , you must be Dr. Suresh . Come on in . Can I get you some tea ? Sorry it took me so long to get here . No , it 's no problem . Is Earl Grey okay ? Yes , that 'll be fine . You sounded rather alarmed on the phone . You seemed to have calmed down some . I had a kind of epiphany about it this morning . Are you familiar with Abraham Maslow , the peak experience ? No , I 'm afraid not . It 's a single moment that takes you out of yourself . Makes you feel very tiny , or very large , to some extent , one with life . Or nature , or God . I see . Like , seeing all the pieces of a puzzle fit together . All this time , I was trying to fight it , deny it . But there is no shame in having this ability , is there ? None whatsoever . It would be like denying you had brown eyes . Right . So , I guess that you want to see my ability . Yes , I mean , I 'm quite anxious to document it . You might want to step back . That looks like a nice jacket . My God . You want to see it again ? Look , for what it 's worth , I 'm sorry for the way things turned out . You know , I could have been a much better person back then . You politicians , you sure know your way around an apology . You and me , we were never gonna work out . In two different worlds . In two different worlds . I hope this goes a long way toward making up for the fact that I wasn 't there for both of you . So ... Where is she ? Claire ? Mmm-hmm . You just missed her . Did she want to see me ? Yeah . I snapped a photo of her . Look how beautiful she is . I 'm sure she is . Take a look , Nathan . She came here with her bags all packed . She thought you were going to rescue her from her tragic life . That sound familiar ? I told her you were just here to pay your money and go . Did I speak out of turn ? I could call her . I could get her to come back . No . You did fine . You did just fine . I should probably be heading back to my family . Just the kids . I 'm very interested in how you control this ability . Well , it 's like riding a bike . For the first time , it 's a little wobbly , and then I discovered something . A kind of peace , a sense of purpose that can only be described as destiny . I 'd like to take a DNA sample . From me ? Okay , sure . Just swab it on the inside of your mouth . The tea . If you 'll excuse me for a second . Of course . I just swab it on the inside of my cheek ? Yes , that 's right . Here you go . DNA sample . Thank you . You know , you should be careful who you talk to about this ability , Zane . There are some people who might not understand , who would want to hurt you . Why would anybody want to hurt me ? I don 't know yet , but I do know this . There are others out there , like you . Really ? How many others ? Dozens , and those are just the ones I know about . With more time and research , I could find hundreds , thousands . But you 're the first one who 's returned my phone calls . But I am going to find them , all of them . I could go with you . I could help you , think about it . These people could need convincing . Who better to do that ? Ando , over here . Hope . You got it . My hero . I was trapped under a bed . Your boyfriend is very large . You mean ex-boyfriend . Come on , I need a ride to Primm , my mom 's house . I 'm sure she would love to meet you . Where is Hiro ? Oh , I took him to meet the guy who could introduce him to Mr. Linderman . He didn 't wait for me ? Well , he said he didn 't really need you anymore . But I didn 't even give you your bag yet . Why didn 't you wait for me ? Three 's a crowd , baby . We gotta go . You are not Ando . S.R. Gustavson , State Gaming Commission . I come in peace . I only saw the blonde , yes , but I heard them talking . I know there were two of them . I 'm telling you , she was incredibly strong . She broke my handcuffs . Any idea where the diamonds are ? You didn 't find the case ? Nope . I guess the incredibly strong killer and her partner must have taken it . Fourth one over , third one back . Fourth one over , third one ... What a joke , Parkman . What a joke . Can 't even do a decent job as a rent-a-cop . He 'll never wear a police badge again in his life . Parkman ? You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm good . Mom , I 'm home . MOHINDER : To survive in this world , we hold close to us those people on whom we depend . We trust in them our hopes , our fears . Go away , you . Mom , what 's going on ? This mangy thing came at me out of nowhere . I think it has rabies . Go away . Scat ! Mom , this is your dog , Mr. Muggles . You love him . I don 't have a dog . I don 't know any Mr. Muggles , and I don 't know you . But what happens when trust is lost ? Where do we run when things we believe in vanish before our eyes ? It 's done . Micah , did I get another package ? Yeah , it 's in your bedroom . Thanks . Opening it now . When all seems lost , the future unknowable , our very existence in peril ... Yeah , I remember him . Not a problem . Consider it done . ... all we can do is run . With this sword ... Our life of legend begins . I 'd like to point out an observation here . Hiro , we 're back in Las Vegas . Right where we started . Only this time ... we have to sneak into Linderman 's hotel ! We have less than two weeks ... to stop the bomb from destroying New York City ! Face it , Hiro . It 's a lost cause . Ando . I will never give up . And neither should you . More than anything , a hero must have hope . Fine . You figure out how to get into Linderman 's office ... I will finde hope . What about our mission ? He hit her . She can 't go back there . We 'll sneak in . Get her bag - You want to break into a hotel room and steal a bag ? You said I need to find Hope . It 's a sign ! You said I need to find Hope . It 's a sign ! It 's a coincidence ! Why is it that whanever you want to do something ... it 's our destiny . But when I want to do something , it 's not important . Charlie ... Linderman ... Charlie was special . She can help us ! This is a terrible idea . All because you like this girl . " A hero does not have regrets . " We 're wasting time . I should just to Linderman 's office without you . We need to go . Now . Why ? did you find Hope 's bag ? " A hero never runs . " Stop saying the things I say to you ! We have to leave ! No . All this time , I have trusted you . Now , it 's your turn to trust me . I have no powers . " A man does not need powers to be a hero . " We 'll call the police . Come on . We 're leaving ! Now ! Fine . Ando ! One . Two . Three . Ando ? Is that you ? I 'm locked in ! She 's an awful woman ! And so strong ! She punched me !

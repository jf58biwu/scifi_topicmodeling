 I ran the scan three times . Recalibrated the equipment . I keep getting a shadow under number 11 . Let me see it . You have a copy of the old aerial scan ? Put it under it . Give me de Vaux 's plot . De Vaux went over this whole site With a fine tooth comb . He 's dead , but he was here 50 years ago . You can say he had a technological disadvantage . Son of a bitch ! What ? This isn 't a shadow . It 's isn 't ? No . Archaeologists have been coming here since 1947 . Sukenik , Harding , de Vaux . They found the dead sea scrolls In 13 of these caves . De Vaux explored another 40 . And all of them missed this . There 's another chamber . It 's hidden under cave 11 . There is ? There is . I want you to get me five men with shovels . Meet me at cave 11 . Got it . Here 's those fragments you wanted me to catalogue . Oh , great . Whew . What 's going on ? We may have just turned the last 50 years Of biblical archeology on its ears . You want to go open an undiscovered cave ? You 're kidding , right ? We found it . Under cave 11 . Let 's go get our hands dirty , shall we ? Absolutely ! There ! It 's a cover stone . Find the edges ! It 's in cuneiform . Sumerian , maybe ? Yeah , maybe . It isn 't a cave . No , it 's a vault . Wait , what ... hey , what are you saying ? Must not open . Death waits below . Oh , don 't be ridiculous . No , no , no , no ! Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! Death waits below . Take it easy . Nobody needs to get hurt . We 're on a search for truth , not treasure . You 're foolish to ignore the word of god . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Maybe he 's right . What ? That god would strike me down If I opened the vault ? Please ! No , no , no . Not god ... Mold . What ? Well , the seal on this vault is airtight . It could contain airborne pathogens , Bacteria , fungi , spores , That could very well kill you . Remember what happened to lord Carnarvon After he opened Tutankhamen 's tomb ? She 's exactly right . I got carried away . We gotta be careful about this and do this right . Russell , go back up and get me some breathers , and also get my air tester . You all right ? Yeah . Good catch . That 's it , Russell . Okay , lift it on three . Just a little bit . One , two , three . Good . All clear . No methane . No toxins beyond normal levels . All right , let 's get down there ! That 's it ! good , come on ! A little bit more ! Good ! Russell , get on the other side . On three , push . One , two , three . Good ! All right , ladder . Look at these . What are they for ? I don 't know . Never seen anything like it . Could they be air vents ? Maybe , but why ? Uh , doc ? Yeah , I see . Wow . Oh , my god . Run ! What ? Run ! Russell ! Unh ! Go , go ! Run ! Russell , come on ! Russell ! Professor ! Nicholas ! Doc ! Nicholas ! Professor ! Nicholas ! Doc ! You think it could be it ? We need to get this back to the university So we open the jar there . Let 's just take one little peek inside . Just a little look , doc . Not until we 're in An environmentally controlled ... Room . Not until then . You need to book us on a flight out of here . All right , but why do I always have to do All the booking of the flights , The lugging of equipment ? All the grunt work , and you Joanna don 't ? Seniority . Tenure . All right , I 'm on it . All right , I 'll help him out . Russell , entire academic careers Have been made out of discoveries like this . Still , doc , I don 't know if this is a good idea . You should face the facts . The fact is she 's the best archaeolinguist on the planet . You could get Hoffmann at Braxton University Or Dr. Lillis at Whittendale . They could help us out . Yes , but she is the best . She 's also your ex-wife . So ? Doc , this is you we 're talking about . You know , you and her , oil and water ? Alcohol and public nudity ? Some things just don 't mix ! Look , doc , I don 't know what happened between you two , And it 's none of my business , But every time someone mentions her name you get all dark and irritable . Then you usually find Two days worth of paperwork to dump on me . It 'd be two hours if you could type . There you go ! You haven 't even seen her yet and you 're already attacking my academic credentials . Give me that . I wasn 't attacking your academic credentials . I was just pondering your lack of posable thumbs . Right there ! You did it again . Not nice , doc ! Not nice . I bet that 's a page-turner . Nicholas . Hello , Ava . What do you want ? Your help . I never thought I 'd hear you say that again . It 's important . I don 't know who else to trust with this . I don 't know . It 's been a long time . Yes , it has . Doesn 't make it any easier , does it ? No , it certainly doesn 't . I 'm glad to see you , Nicholas . Really . You look good . I hope you 're happy . But I don 't want to do this anymore , So please leave . Ava , I think I just found the last dead sea scroll . You what ? How ? Qumran . I found an undiscovered man made vault under cave 11 . Was there a clay jar in it ? Yes ! Did you open it ? No . The lid is sealed . All right , but we do it my way , no debates . Fine , but I have to have my graduate students with me . They helped me find it . Agreed . Great . So see you in an hour ? All right , fine . Thank you . All right , I 'll meet you inside . Dr. Greenaway is waiting on us . So what 's the deal between him and Greenaway anyhow ? I 'm surprised he 's even talking to her . What happened ? I 'm not really sure of all the details , but ... about five years ago One of Nicholas' grad students accused him of sexual harassment . Yeah . It got ugly . She said that they had an affair , and after she broke it off , he harassed her . Dr. Greenaway found out about the affair and dumped him ? Well , that 's just the thing . There never was an affair . Turned out that she had some mental problems and was just obsessed with him . I mean , he was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing , but ... it was after a pretty lengthy investigation . So why did they break up ? I don 't know . I guess Dr. Greenaway didn 't believe in him and that 's when things got broken between them . Come on , I don 't want to miss the opening of the jar . Dr. Greenaway , these are my assistants , Joanna and Russell . Nice to meet you . Joanna . It 's extraordinary . The seal is cracked , but it 's intact . We had a little trouble getting it out of the chamber . Yeah , like nearly dying . Oh , he exaggerates . Do you want to open it or shall I ? you always had the steadier hands . I thought you forgot . Okay . Gentle . Aidan , take this to Caitlin for dating . Thank you . Let 's see what we have here . Dear god , they are amazing . The most well-preserved papyrus I 've ever seen . Are they decipherable ? This is different than anything I 've ever encountered before . Look , the structure , the syntax , it 's unlike the other scrolls discovered at Qumran . But you can translate them , though , right ? It 's going to take time . There 's a lot of information here . There are a battery of tests I want to run . I 'll put my entire team on it . Give me three weeks . But ... Nicholas , let me do my work . All right . All right , fine . I 'll see you then . Caitlin , come here . Come see . Aidan , come here . So what 'd you find ? Nicholas . I only managed to decipher half the documents , And that wasn 't easy . There 's more to this than you can see on the surface . A palimpsest . Yes . What ? A palimpsest is parchment , sometimes vellum . It 's written on , then the ink is washed away and it 's reused . Only the surface text is visible To the naked eye , but there are secrets hat lie beneath . So what is it ? It 's the book of Genesis . My god . Carbon dating says it was written around 380 B. C. While the exodus scrolls are somewhere between 98 BC. and 13 AD . Yes . And you just said this is the book of Genesis . As in the Book . The unabridged edition . There are things in here that are not in any translation of the old testament . This is the oldest biblical document ever discovered . Cool ! There is still work to be done , but if it bears out , this could be one of the most significant discoveries in the history of mankind . Well , the dead sea scroll was pretty significant . Why is this one so special ? According to these scrolls , Noah was sent on more than one mission from god . It says early in the time of man , giants , creatures , and demons roamed the earth . They were called the Nephilim . God banished all these evil beings , for he thought their wickedness was corrupting mankind . All of them were gone except one . It was created by the darkness to do its bidding . Tormented and tortured , the darkness took pleasure in the creature 's pain . The darkness ? It 's a reference to an evil being . The devil , perhaps . It 's metaphorical . The devil didn 't exist . Some religions don 't recognize the devil . And some do . It 's not metaphorical . It 's a matter of faith . Right , fine . Faith it is . Go on . The creature was to roam the earth killing the faithful , until god summoned a righteous man , Noah . God to spoke to Noah and ordered him to build a mighty ship to banish the darkness . So you 're saying there was more than one ark ? Yes . The first ark was Noah 's test by god . Well , I guess he passed . Actually , he didn 't . Noah captured the creature and set sail for the far ends of the earth , to banish it . For if left unchecked , it was determined to annihilate all of mankind . Get out of town ! So Noah built a monster ark ? I suppose you could call it that . It says the powers of evil were fighting with god over the ship . They did not want the last of their breed banished . Lightning struck the ship and it began to burn . And as it burned , a spear rose from the depths and cleaved the ark in two . I managed to decode the next part of the palimpsest . It appears to be coordinates of a map . It 's in the middle of Iraq . It 'd be impossible to explore that right now . Not necessarily . Doc , you don 't plan on going into Iraq , do you ? Don 't worry . I wouldn 't expect you to come with me . I 'll go . I appreciate that , but I don 't know If anyone is going just yet . I 'll have to talk to someone . Oh , I 'm sure she 'd love to follow you there , professor . Yeah , um , I gotta go . Me too . You can 't just leave things alone , can you ? Me ? I 'm fine . I 'm just amazed that you continue to play games with your career and your reputation . She 's my student , Ava . That 's all . I 've heard that before . That 's right . You heard the truth . And you were the one who chose to ignore it . What did you want me to think ? No , really , what did you want me to do ? Just walk around campus and be the oblivious wife ? Not me , nick ! Not anymore ! I loved you . I was faithful to you . I trusted you . I am sorry that you were too blind to see that . I 'm sorry . I have faith in something else now . Oh , your faith ... your faith , your righteousness . You 're always right , aren 't you ? Don 't go there . Please , don 't go there . Hell , you have more faith in a biblical fairytale than you ever did in your own husband who was right in front of you . Don 't you mock my beliefs ... No , you 're a scientist , Ava ! You should act like one ! That 's right ! You just love to push the buttons , don 't you ? But if you can 't touch it , or see it , or have some rational explanation for it then you don 't want to hear about it . I think I made a mistake by coming here . So do I. Damn it . And that 's really the basis behind the classification scheme . Excuse me . Hi . What are you doing here ? I want to talk to you . Uh , I 'm a little busy right now . It 's important . Oh , okay , yeah , join the meeting . This is Dr. Ava Greenaway . Dr. Greenaway , this is Mr. Fasanella from Federal Tactical Intelligence . What is it that you do ? We do satellite mapping and imagery , among other things . I see . I made an inquiry to the defense department about the coordinates that we found on the palimpsest . Apparently , it raised some flags . Earlier this month we launched a satellite that was tasked with monitoring The Sunni triangle for insurgent activity . Almost as soon as the bird went up , it began sending us readings That indicated an energy anomaly . In the area we want to have an expedition ... Is within the quadrant registering the anomaly . What do you think it is ? We don 't know for sure . Communication in the area is spotty at best . The troops have a very difficult time Operating there , and the insurgents know that and take full advantage of it . It could be a weapons cache , or a secret bomb making facility , or worse . Weapons of mass destruction . Possibly . We 'll be sending a small strike team to the area to investigate , but we thought with your particular expertise in archeology , it might be mutually beneficial to bring you along . You might spot something our boys don 't . I 'm going with him . No , you 're not . It 's gonna be very dangerous at best . I 'm the only one who can decipher the documents . I haven 't even finished with them yet . I 'll provide more information for you when we go . I said no , and that 's final . I don 't remember asking for your permission , Nicholas . Who should you start now ? Why don 't you stop with the sarcasm ? Sarcasm ? Me ? Oh , that is rich . Excuse me , Doctor . Put your team together . You 'll be meeting up with the transport in the morning . I don 't want to be responsible if anything were to happen to you . You don 't have to be responsible for me . I can take care of myself . Look ... I have to do this . I believe in it . Just trust me . Please . This is crazy . You know that . We should wait until the war is over , When it 's safe . No , anything that is out there can be looted or destroyed by then . No , we are gonna do this now , not in five years ' time . Nicholas . All right . Joanna , right ? Yeah . I just want to apologize for my comment the other day in the lab . That was uncalled for . Yeah , it was . Okay , well , I just want to apologize . Apology noted . You don 't like me very much , do you ? No , that 's not true . I just really care about this expedition , and ... well , I 'm concerned about you coming along . You think that I 'm a problem ? Well , where we 're going is not exactly a walk in the park , and ... I just think that everyone should be in top form . No distractions . You think I 'm a distraction . I 'm sorry . Maybe it 's not my place . Joanna , I am going , and you and I are going to have to work together . Okay . If anyone wants to back out now , I wouldn 't think any less of you . We 're going to the most dangerous place on the planet . And there 's a real possibility Of getting hurt or worse . Forget it , Doc . It 's Noah 's Ark we 're talking about here . As they say in Texas hold ' em , we 're all in . All right , then . First stop is Dover , then we catch a transit plane to Iraq . I 'm driving . What ? H-how come you always drive ? Because you can 't . Yes , I can . What he does cannot be considered driving . Oh , he knows you well . I ... Oh , great , now you 're all ganging up on me . What ... So if we find this ark , are you still gonna think the bible is fiction ? Whatever we find will be an archaeological artifact . I 'm interested in proving historical realities , not perpetuating biblical stories . I 'm not going on a crusade here , And I don 't know the frequent flyer miles . You 're amazing . What ? We 're about to discover The first ark that Noah built , And yet you refuse to believe . In what religion ? What about God , Jesus Christ , Mohammad , Buddha , Vishnu ? No , there are plenty of people who believe in those things And have done horrible things to their fellow man in the name of their religion . Yes , but you cannot let what men do affect your belief in a higher power . I 've never felt the need to have something in the universe to intercede in my life . I am in control of my life . And if people took responsibility for their actions , The world would be a better place . But I would hate to live like you do . You know , just living like there 's nothing out there . That we die and we get buried in the earth for a future archaeologist to dig up . I sometimes envy you . I ... I think it would be easier to live life with those blinders on , But I can 't do it . I can 't . This scroll you found , the fact that it was buried In a vault beneath a cave ... You think that somebody didn 't want them found . Yes . Yeah , that 's a pretty safe bet . You know the legend surrounding the scrolls . The secret brotherhood sworn to protect them . That possibility doesn 't concern you ? That doesn 't worry me . It 's all fiction for the faithful . That is definitely one of the reasons why we broke up . You have no faith in anything unless you can see it . The reason we broke up Is because you had no faith in me . This is Cain . Hello ? Hello ! It has been found . We must alert the brotherhood before it 's too late . Nicholas Zavatterro . Major gentry . Welcome to the sandbox . Thanks . We 'll talk in my command center . Come on ! The search area is ten kilometers square . We 're using a low-profile tack team . I don 't know about this , major . Aren 't there an awful lot of insurgents out there ? We 're gonna look just like any other patrol . Not something for them to target with their forces . The only thing we need to worry about Is the roadside bombs . Oh , that makes me feel better . We 're going to a communication dead zone . The sat phone will be spotty at best . Excuse me . May I state the obvious here . I think we need a full unit to go in there . Ma 'am , with all due respect , I don 't tell you what rock to dig up . I appreciate you not telling me How to run no damn operation . Get your gear together . We leave in one hour . All right , listen up , you guys . I didn 't expect it to be this hairy . Maybe I should be the only one to go out there For safety reasons . We 're all here now . Might as well go . We all knew the risks when we signed up . Besides , I don 't know about you , but I 'm not gonna sit around here while you go out there and discover the most important archaeological find in the history of mankind . All right , let 's go . You getting out ? I got out the last six times . I think I 'll sit this one out . I don 't know . You think we got the coordinates wrong ? One more hour , then we set up camp for the night . We need more time , Major . You don 't have more time . I 'm trying to do my job , And you 're making this more and more difficult . I suggest you find this damn thing in the next hour . Nicholas , it says " a great spear rose up from the sea and cleaved the ark in two . " There . And there . That could be it . A bump ? After 5,000 years , you 'd be worn down too . Number seven . Lucky seven . This is where it is . Where ? I don 't see anything . Look closer . Look at the shape of the rocks . Look at the upper sections . How they could be the hull of a ship . Yes , yes ! In Noah 's time , this entire plain was under water . See how the bottom of the hull must be embedded in what was once the sea floor . We did it . We found it . Whatever it is , It has one hell of an energy footprint . But I 'm gonna send my men down there first just in case . Stand back ! Over here ! This must the section that leads to underground . I said stand back ! All right , but don 't touch anything . Relax , doc . It 's petrified . I 'm not gonna break it . Come on , let 's go , y 'all . Get down there . All clear ! Men , stand down . yes , sir ! It looks just as it 's written . So you gonna open it up , doc ? No , I 'm not gonna open it up . This ... is a priceless archaeological relic found on what could be Noah 's Ark . I 'm not touching anything until this site is properly secured , and then we get it back to the states and open it up there . Doc , I 'm not debating with you . This box is pumping an energy signal the D. I. A. sent me after . So either you open it up or I will . with some C-4 . C-4 , check ! No , no , all right , all right , all right . We 'll set up a port-a-lab in base camp and get it up there . Thought you 'd see it my way . Men , get to it ! Carefully ! Carefully . All right , put it over there . This is the gopher-wood cage they put the demon in . Are you sure we want to open it ? Whatever was in this crate is long dead . But then where 's the energy coming from ? We 're about to find that out . Goggles , everybody . All right , lasing . Okay . Did you see that ? It moved . It 's not possible . Yeah , maybe someone should tell it that . Run ! What the hell was that ? Where the hell is it ? It went that way , major ! What was that thing ? Damned if I know . Get Martinez ! We got two men down in there ! Martinez , we have a medical emergency in the lab tent . Do you copy ? Over . No ! Aah ! Argh ! No , no ! Aah ! No ! Aah ! Get that sucker ! Watson ! Go ! Go after it ! If you get it in your sights , send it back to hell ! Soldier , you stay with me ! Major ... Solider ! No can do . Don 't you die on me ! Martinez ! Zeke ! No . You guys get to the APC . Lock yourselves in . You guys should be safe there . Let 's go . Just leave him ? No , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , come on ! Here it comes ! Everybody run ! If you guys are gonna do something , now would be a good time ! Get out of the way ! if we shoot , we 're gonna take out the generator . To hell with it ! Aah ! Come on . Is it dead ? Lost it when it took out the generator . Show me a body ! Not dead , sir . You mean that thing survived the explosion ? No body , no blood . Just tracks into the desert . Mount up ! We 're gonna hunt it down and kill it . Hutch ! Russell , it 's Jo . You okay ? Take the APC and get those civilians back to camp liberty . Is it over ? Yeah , it 's over . Did we get it ? No . We have a problem , sir . I don 't like problems , corporal . Well , that creature took out most of our fuel with that generator . What we 've got left is not enough for all the vehicles . And this was my favorite shirt . Well , you stay here an protect the civilians , and I 'll be back for you . Yes , sir . What ? ! No , no , no , no . You are not gonna leave us here . You do as I say , professor . Get in that damn APC and don 't come out till I get back ! You listen to me . I want my people out of here now ! I don 't care how many stripes you have on your sleeve . Your job is to protect us ! If you shut up and listen to me , that 's what I 'm gonna do . If one of my people gets hurt , I 'm coming after you . These people 's lives are in my hands . Welcome to my world . That thing just killed two of my men . I 'm sure as hell not gonna let it get away . Here ! Nothing gets through the APC armor , nothing ! Can 't we just call for help ? Ma 'am , all our communications been trashed . That thing is getting away as we speak . It 's almost dawn . I will be back before noon . Now it 's on you . It 's kind of creepy that they carry their own body bags with them . It 's Iraq . The sad reality is they 're standard . I didn 't sign up for this . None of us did . We have to set this right . Look , I can deal with being in a war zone . Hell , it 's scary . But to be a part of an archaeological discovery , this important to find . I 'm in. but this thing , this creature ... I don 't do razor-sharp teeth . Radio 's toast . We should bed down in the APC , get some rest . Nicholas , we made a huge mistake . Yeah , well , you can 't put the genie back in the bottle . That is just it . I have been studying these scrolls . It says that if this creature is released , an age of darkness will descend upon all mankind . The beginning will mark the end . Are you saying that by releasing this demon we 've triggered the apocalypse ? I 'm saying that we put this creature right back in its prison . Oh , Ava , I don 't know . Nicholas , you just saw this creature that 's from the time of Noah come back to life . Now if you do not believe in this prophecy , You never will . She 's right , doc . I 'm not a religious guy , but ... I 'm starting to give this whole bible thing another look . There has to be a logical explanation for this . It could be some prehistoric creature from the past . A leftover from the age of the dinosaurs . Come on ! No . We 've known certain species of fish that have been extinct for 70,000 years until someone pulls one up in a fishing boat in 1938 . Coelacanth . That 's right . Yeah , well , I 'll tell you what . The only thing I believe in is staying alive . And right now , the best place to be is between two inches of plate armor out in the APC . Just in case your little friend decides He wants to come back and have some more fun time . I 'm with him . Me too . All right , he 's right . Let 's go , come on . You see anything ? Negative . You summoned me . This is a very important day , Belus . Whether it beckons our salvation or our destruction is completely in your hands . I don 't understand . The genesis scroll has been found . But it has eluded our own people for centuries . Who ? Who 's made the discovery ? An American professor , Nicholas Zavatterro . Our spies tells us he already mounted an expedition . The secret is in grave danger . The knowledge must not be allowed to pass into the wrong hands . If it does and they release it , We are lost . I will have it back in our possession within 48 hours . You must do whatever is necessary . I will not fail you . If you do , you will fail a great deal more than just me . Hold it , hold it ! What is it ? Tracks . They go up that way . What 's in that direction ? There 's nothing on the map , sir . It 's heading that way for a reason . Come on , let 's go ! Well ? That 's where they stop . So it could be anywhere . You guys hear that ? Where 's it coming from ? Out there . Lock and load . Let 's go ! Fire it up ! Coles , left flank . Wilson , right flank . I 'm on point . Good hunting . It 's gone ! Double back ! Come and get me ... You stinking bag of bones . Yaah ! Don 't shoot ! I almost killed you . I thought you were that thing . How could you possibly mistake me for whatever the hell that is ? You 're right . Now that you mention it , you are a lot uglier . Aah ! Aah ! Eat this ! And this ! Y 'all all right ? Oh , you want to play hard to get . Okay . I 'll play with you . get out of the way ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ? she probably doesn 't speak English , smart guy . Wilson , you okay ? Yes , sir ! Coles ? Just a scratch , sir . Let 's keep moving . Major ? Major ? It 's gone . Let 's head back . We got some civilians to babysit . Light it up ! We lost it . Any contact ? Hit us hard last night in the APC , but it 's been quiet since then , sir . Come on , follow me . Yes , sir . Professor ! We need to have a little talk . Now I don 't know what that thing was , But two of my men are dead because of it , And I want some answers . I don 't have any answers yet . What does the scroll say the ark was carrying ? The ark was used to banish the darkness . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? It 's some sort of animal . Listen , guys , no damn animal Can do that kind of damage or take the kind of firepower I shot at it . This creature is a holdover from the time before god created man . This is not something that 's supposed to coexist with mankind . It was not supposed to survive . Well , I got news for y 'all . It survived and it 's out there . If it gets in the wrong hands , it 's gonna be one hell of a weapon . We shot everything we could at it , and we couldn 't kill it . We 've seen what it can do , and we 've got to stop it . Screw that . I say we get the hell out of here . Yeah , I need to get my team back to safety . I don 't want them running around after some animal . I will go with you , but not them . If we split up , we 'd be twice as vulnerable . I can send your people back with hutch . It could attack them , and they won 't have enough firepower to protect themselves . The major 's right . We are going to do this . God ordered Noah to banish this thing . Oh , his bad . What 's that got to do with us ? The scroll is a code . It talks of this creature Destroying entire lands . Of sending the world into a time of darkness . We 're responsible for letting this creature out , Which means we 're responsible for bringing about the prophecy . You really believe that . It was right in front of you . You saw it with your own two eyes . How can you deny that ? I say we do it . Great , fine . How ? Okay , I managed to decipher this code a little farther last night . Right here it talks about how god gave Noah a staff . It has a golden tip and it 's imbued with special powers . It will allow the faithful to pierce the heart of darkness . And only by doing this will the creature be stopped . What does that mean ? It means we have to find the staff . Let me see that for a minute . well , where would we even begin to look ? All right , these glyphs . Have you been able to figure them out yet ? No , it 's unlike anything I 've seen before . I think they 're numbers , not letters . All right , this area right here . Is that the section that 's talking about Noah 's staff ? Yes , yes . But it goes on to say that Noah lived to be 700 years old and then he died . That 's it ! They 're coordinates . For what ? If I 'm right , Noah 's tomb . And his staff is buried with him ? Major ! Can you get us here ? I 'll get you there . I 've hacked into American military satellites . According to the imagery , there has been some very recent activity where the legend says the Ark may have gone down . It 's possible they have found it . You must get there before they do . If they find the Ark , the world is in grave danger . I understand . # take back your energy # # take back your new way # # her lipstick smeared all over # # me not know a thing # # # # he says his mind can 't hold that weight again # # you know you 've got # # you know you 've got # # the way to show me how you feel # # this time will come ... # Wait , what are they called again ? The noachidae . They 're descendants of Noah . They 're a secret brotherhood . The first masons . Some say the most powerful secret society in the world . They 're the ones who would have built Noah 's tomb . And guarded it . Kept it secret for thousands of years . You actually believe in that ? I don 't know what to believe anymore . It 's a start . # # Unh ! Aah ! Unh ! aah ! They found it . It is here . I always knew within my heart ... that the legend was true , but to see it with my eyes ... Over here ! Yes . We were too late . I 'm sorry . Yes . Yes , sir . Yes , we will find them . See that you do . Don 't ! Might be a booby trap . Stand down ! All clear ! What did this ? I 'll give you one guess . No military operation done this . No impact craters . No burns . No bombs or artillery done this . Men getting torn apart . It had to be your monster did this , professor . It got here before we did . It 's trying to outflank us , cut us off . But how ? I mean , that would imply some level of organized thinking . A higher intelligence . Don 't look at me . Y 'all two the genius . You let the damn thing out . Why would it do this ? Maybe he knows we 're trying to kill it . Unh ! Don 't get any ideas . Furthest thing from my mind . You see him ? Over there ! One of the survivors ! I ain 't got time for this . Aah ! Unh ! Welcome to paradise . Come on , let 's move out ! We should be coming up on it . There ! Right there ! Right to the right ! Men , secure the area ! Corporal , watch out back . Yes , sir ! Noah 's tomb should be subterranean . Someone excavated the site . Yeah , from the looks of it maybe ... 40 years ago or so ... There ! Found it ! Looks like a map room . Russell , hand me a light . Nicholas ? Down here . Oh , my god . He really lived here . How do we know what we 're looking for ? I 'm not sure . Wait a minute . There was this part in the scroll that I couldn 't identify , looks like measurements . It 's on this third palimpsest . Let me see . Yeah , yeah , this is a measurement , But this is the ... alignment of the sun . At its apex . Ava , what time is it ? It 's almost noon . Okay , hurry . I 'm looking for a portal or a hole in the ground somewhere . Whoa , what about this ? That 's it , good work . Uh , we need a staff . A staff . Ava , how long ? Um , almost four cubit . Russell , these shovels right here . Pull on that . Pull . One more , come on . Got it . Well done . That 's it . Looks like it 's right underneath that central chamber . All right , let 's go . Okay . Yeah , this is it . This is it . Okay , we 're going in . Not without me . Russell , let there be light . It 's been raided . Maybe we read the scroll incorrectly . It is in here . Or maybe this is a wild goose chase . Maybe we aren 't meant to stop it . No , no , no , no . Ava , look at this structure . There 's something behind this wall . See how it stops right here . Yes . This may be what we 're looking for . Oh , I wish I could do this the right way , but ... We 're gonna have to improvise . There . Yep , everybody give me a hand with this . Doc , you 're not gonna do what I think you , are you ? Yes . But after all those lectures on respecting the artifacts ? Would you rather sit here and wait for that thing to come back and kill us ? You 're right . I 'm all over it . Come on , everybody . Major . All right , everybody . One , two , three ! Hey , doc . Yeah ? Here you go . That 's good , Major . They are here . Put it down , put it down ! Oh , man , this can 't be good . Keep an eye on them . You come with me . Put your weapons down now ! Drop the weapon now ! Drop the weapon ! Put the weapon down , man ! Put it down , man ! Put the weapon down , man ! Put the weapon down . Where you going ? Where you going ? Where you going ? Where you going ? Get away from the door , man . Never gonna happen . Drop it . Put the weapon down ! Get away from the door ! Never gonna happen , man ! It 's never gonna happen . I 'm not playing with you . Hold it . Everybody watch your step . Ava , there 's another cylinder . It should have a scroll in it . It could lead us to the staff . Okay . Aah ! Everybody run ! Unh ! Come on ! Come on ! Run ! What 's happening ? I don 't know ! But I don 't like it . Joanna , look out ! Nicholas ! Come on , hurry ! I 'm right behind you ! Go ! Get out of here ! Let 's go , come on ! Oh ! Aah ! Unh ! Aah ! Nicholas ! Nicholas ! Help me ! Help ... whoa ! Where 's Nicholas ? Just sit still . He 's still in here . He 's ... no ... No , no , it 's too late . It 's too late . I 'm sorry . You can 't make it . Don 't you tell me that ! Oh , my god , no ! I have a medical kit in the back . Aah ! Please ! Oh , no , no , no ! God , don 't let me die in here . Not like this . Aah ! Major , we got a situation ! Hostiles ! Get to cover , get to cover ! Don 't you move ! I 'll put this bullet right through your head . Now get out of there ! Hurry up ! Turn around . Now everybody come out , Or I 'm gonna put a bullet in his head . Corporal , get their guns ! Hands behind the head . Who the hell are you ? Hey , honey . Oh , thank god . Oh ! Oh , my ... what happened ? I 'm not sure you 'd believe it . How 's Russell ? He 's not good . How 's he doing ? Get up ! Now I ain 't gonna ask you again . Be right back . Who the hell are you ? Unh ! You answer him ! Who are you ? Where are you from ? I think the lady asked you a question . You 're gonna giver her an answer , or I 'm gonna kill you . You 're interested in this . Careful . Will you tell me who you are ? The same people who have worked for 5,000 years to protect the secret . The secret you 've unleashed . You 're Noachidae ? So the legend is true ? Where did you get that ? From my grandmother . Why ? At ease . Oh , my god . What is that ? The symbol , what does it mean ? It is a symbol of the order to be passed down from one generation to the next . No , this was special because it was my mother 's and it was in my family for generations . My parents died in a crash . My grandmother raised me . The ... she ... You mean that my grandmother is Noachidae ? Yes , as are you . I don 't ... why wouldn 't she tell me that ? The knowledge is only to be passed when the child is 19 , not before . She died when I was 16 . Wait , what does she have to do with this ? Are you saying she 's a part of this ? The scroll 's the first link in the chain . The scroll 's location and the secret it protected Have been safely in our possession for 5,000 years . Christianity was not even a religion . A member of the order renounced his vow and threatened to reveal the secret to the world . He took the scroll . He hid it . Neither he nor the scroll were ever found . Fearing discovery , the order scattered itself around the world And never giving up on its true mission , And searched the far corners of the earth For that scroll . But what about the other scroll ? The scroll that was inside Noah 's tomb ? The order put it there when we moved Noah 's body to another secret location . It gives that location , But it 's too late now . The secret has been revealed . And if we don 't stop it now , the world is doomed . Stop it ? The desert swallowed it whole . It 's over . It lives . If you have read the scroll , you know there 's only one way to stop that creature . Noah 's staff . And you know where it is . Yes . Look , you said it yourself . If we don 't capture this creature , then the world is doomed . Now I understand that you were sent here to stop us , To protect your secret . But it 's too late for that . If we 're gonna do this thing , then we 're gonna have to work together . It would violate the vow . Your vow versus the future of mankind . I don 't think there 's much of a choice in that . The staff lies with Noah . He was buried with it . And where did the order move Noah 's body ? Tell me ! I am a member of the order . You have to tell me , right ? You must swear to me . If I help you , you must promise to keep and protect the secret as if the original vow was yours and yours alone . No . You must not allow the world to know what you have learned . No , I 'm a scientist . The knowledge of ... You must promise ! Some things are more valuable than knowledge . Such as ? Faith . To reveal what you have discovered would be to rob those who believe of their faith . And that 's not for any man . You swear to me this vow , I will help you . I will take you to the staff . He 's fading ... we need to do something for him ! If I make this promise to you , will you make one to me ? What do you ask ? One of our men is badly injured . He needs a doctor . I will keep this secret for you If you inform your pilot to get my man to medical attention . You 'll risk the future of the world for one man ? Two minutes ago you weren 't even willing to give us the truth . I think it 's fair . His life for your secret . Very well . My pilot will take your man to the hospital . And your secret will be safe . Unh ! Hang in there , Russell , okay , you 're gonna make it . I 'm gonna die , aren 't I ? No , no , you 'd annoy god too much . Joanna , I want you to go with him . Make sure he gets the best medical attention . All right , we will be okay without you . No , no , I want to see this thing through . Russell needs you more than we do right now , and I do not want another one of my students getting hurt . Please do as I say and go with him . Okay , okay , but be careful . I will . Now go , go ! Doc ! Yeah , buddy ? Kill that son of a bitch . Will do . Go ! Some biblical historians believe that Noah was buried in the graveyard of the kings on the island of Bahrain . Which is exactly what the order wants you to think . I told you , the order spent 5,000 years hiding the truth about Noah . Even the church ? The church has become somewhat reluctant conspirators , And even they don 't know the entire truth . We 've got to great lengths , Dr. Zavatterro . Nothing 's left for chance and nothing 's an accident . Why did you move Noah 's body ? The ancient city was built by the Noachidae . The order moved Noah 's body to protect it . The creature was once banished by Noah . It will seek out the staff and will destroy it . We 're coming up on Al Bajib . There was an Iraqi army platoon stationed there , but if they bugged out and the insurgents have taken control , I expect everyone here to keep their heads up . Captain Bahar . We 've been having insurgent problems for the last three days . Hutch , take the APC and block off the end of the road . Yes , sir . I 'll be with you in a minute . Keep your eyes open . Corporal , get my flank . Corporal , stand guard . You won 't be needing that in here . You 're not getting my gun . This is a house of god . You got them fooled , but not me . Very well . We must hurry . The crypt is beneath the altar . Sister , please , please . Give me a hand . No , this is ... this is all wrong . The markings , the frescoes . This is a crusader 's tomb . A little farther east than I would 've expected , but the tomb of a knight of the crusades nonetheless . Things are not what they seem . Are you saying that Noah is buried here ? And the staff is buried with him . You better be right about this . Come on , move over . Come on , put some weight into it ! a little more . This can 't be . It 's dirt ? We wasted our time looking for your magic stick , professor and this guy led us To a box full of dirt ? ! No , it 's here , I know it 's here . How would you know that ? I know , I believe it . Nicholas , how ... Ava , I believe . I believe it ! aah ! You hold him off . I 'll warn the Major . Good ! Aah ! You had faith when I did not . Major , I just saw it . Let 's go get it . What was that thing ? Long story . We 'll destroy it , but we 're gonna need your help . We 're with you . But the monster is gone . No , no , it 'll come back . It 'll come back and kill everyone here . We gotta figure out a way to destroy this thing once and for all . Now how does this work ? What do we have to do ? The staff has to be in the hands of a man With faith and righteousness for it to work . All right , so you 'll hold it . No , I doubted my faith . You did not . You must be the one . He 's right ... you 're the only one who believed . All right , then we 've gotta figure out a way to flush this thing towards me . I got an idea . How many grenades do you got left ? What are you thinking , Major ? We 'll rig explosions all around the village . We 'll be the bait to lure it out . We 'll draw it to the intersection towards doc . There 's just one problem . What 's that ? We don 't have enough explosives . But we do . We 've got explosives and grenades in our barracks . Good . I need your men to get the people out of the village . Get them to a safe distance . Doc , we 'll be back when we 're ready for you . Let 's go ! Nicholas ... When we were at the ruins , I asked you what happened to you . You said that I wouldn 't understand . What happened to you ? The chamber was collapsing all around me . And I knew I wasn 't gonna make it out alive . So I closed my eyes ... And I asked god to let me live . And he did . I should 've been crushed , but I wasn 't . And I can 't find another way to explain it . There is only one way . There is . All right , let 's get to work . We 're gonna need that cage . It will be taken care of . It is ready . Very good . You okay ? I 'm scared . What if this doesn 't work ? It 'll work . You 're telling me to have faith ? Yeah , I guess I am . Be careful . I will . All right , let 's do this . Come on out , kitty , kitty ! Kitty ? Kitty , kitty . Come to big daddy . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I just want to rub you . My gun 's jammed ! Major , I 've got him ! Aah ! Aah ! Come on and get me ! It isn 't working . It 's gonna kill ' em ! Do it ! Nicholas ! Unh ! Oh , my god . It 's not ... it 's not working . What haven 't we done ? Pierce its heart ! I don 't know if I can . You can , Nicholas , you can , just believe it ! I need that crate ! Hurry ! Hurry ! I can 't hold on much longer ! I can 't hold on ! Now ! Lock it ! There are still many secrets to protect . Things that if revealed would shake The very foundation of belief . You have done well . You all have done well . And I trust that this will remain between us . I 'm sure you may want this back . You 've earned the right to carry it . Come . We have much to discuss . So ... What other little treasures are you guys hiding ? All in good time . Where will it go ? Someplace safe . It 's time . We must go . I 'll be right with you . Well , doc , it was nice knowing you . You too , major . You gonna hop a ride with them guys ? Yeah , I think so . Thank you , Major . You saved my ass out there . I ought a be thanking you . And do me a favor . Take care of that ex-wife of yours , man . She 's still into you . I will . You ready ? Yes . Yeah . Sync by Caradecuica

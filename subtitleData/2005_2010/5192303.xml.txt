May I take your order ? please . as if I was being chased out of town . When this photo of the people of Subasci and the UNF working together ... ... it was believed by many that this event would spur on a call for a cease fire . But this civil war didn 't prove to be that simple . every corner of the country was now engulfed by smoke and explosions . The creation of a roadmap that will lead to a cease-fire is already in its final stages . there will be a basic consensus will be reached between the local armed insurgent groups and the UN . the major insurgent groups have expressed their agreement . They are using this flag as a symbol of peace .

It 's safe to say that peace is a long way off yet . our roadmap to peace has entered its second phase . A new plan of operations to deal with the armed insurgents has been officially established .

The flag that you shot ... ... it 's become a symbol of those who wish for peace . What was once nothing more than a scrap of cloth has now become a link that binds people 's hearts together . We 're coming in to land . Please make sure your seatbelt is fastened . The flag was being kept under tight security at the Kufura House to be used at the signing of the peace accord . However ... Then the flag was stolen . The precious flag that was a symbol for peace was stolen by an insurgent group that didn 't want peace right before the peace negotiations . ... this country will forever lose its chance to regain peace .

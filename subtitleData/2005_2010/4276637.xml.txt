 Carl ? I heard about the young woman . Were you able to correct her condition ? Do you know her ? I 'd like to be kept up-to-date on her progress . Yeah , you and who else ? When did you start working for Roth ? Take your hand off me . If humans follow the same timeline as the monkeys , in a week , possibly two , Nina may begin to experience the same violent tendencies . We need to destroy the stem cells that activated Nina 's Jacobson 's organ . Pressurized oxygen gets into Bob 's brain , could cause oxidative stress , that could make the Herpes virus pop out of the DNA . We can kill it with the antivirals . It 's gone . I 'm sorry . Nina 's three months pregnant . When I was a kid , I got sick . David , what happened to me ... the baby ... It can 't be mine . When I was nine , they thought I had testicular cancer . But what I really had was cysts . - Okay ... - During the surgery , they figured out that it wasn 't cancer . But there were complications . How bad ? My semen contains very few sperm . I never knew how few until Dr. Bruen checked . What was the count ? Zero . I 'm completely sterile . I 'm sorry , Bob . David ... This pregnancy is very , very confusing . Here . Thank you . You 're welcome . Look , it 's ... It 's really not that big a mystery , Bob . I mean , you were gone a long time and maybe ... Nina probably thought she was never gonna see you again , she got lonely . - Along comes another guy ... - She would never cheat on me , David . Okay then ... Maybe somebody made a mistake . That happens . We 'll get Carlos to get a genetic sample of the fetus from Dr. Bruen . We 'll compare it to your DNA . Find out for sure if you 're the father . The baby is mine . Of course , Bob . Did you get the test results for the CDC back yet ? - Oh , sorry . - Do you remember my friend Jack Bowden ? - Africa , right ? - That 's right . David , greetings from Moldova . - You 're kidding . - WHO was called in on a mystery illness - in a city called Birku . - Over 200 dead . They sent me with a team of 4 doctors but ... - we 're getting absolutely nowhere . - Symptoms ? Healthy people are suddenly bleeding from their mouth and their nose . They 're feverish , having difficulty breathing , then come convulsions , paralysis , coma and death . How quickly ? Couple of days . Jesus . Any guesses ? We 've been going round in circles on this one . Now we 're wondering if the equipment and lab techs here are so substandard . And you guys are the best . Riddlemeyer would have an aneurysm if he caught us working outside our jurisdiction . He 'll be fine with it . Everyone wants to keep Moldova away from Russia , so ... Got to show them we can help our friends . Okay , send us samples . Blood , urine , all you got , we 'll see what we can do . That would be great , David . Carlos , take care of yourself , okay ? - Alright . Bye , Jack . - Thanks , guys . - Thank you , David . - No problem . Any news ? Am I the father ? We 'll get results soon , Bob . Come on , Bob . Let 's give Carlos some space . Come on . - You okay ? - Sure . Sure . It 's taking him long time . - He 's just being thorough . - It 's just a routine test ! Nothing is routine for Carlos . So , am I the father ? More complicated than that , Bob . - What I 'm trying to say is ... - Just say it . Your baby 's a clone . Say again . A clone of you , Bob . ReGenesis 4x12 The Sounds of Science Subtitles Team NorBAC Anyone , Bbsiocnarf , Dapitch666 Linwelin , Michvanilly Version NoTag 1.0 - Did you retest ? - That is the retest . Guthrie BioLab do more paternity tests than anyone else in Canada . They got the same results I did . I don 't believe this . A team in Oregon was successful cloning primate cells . But they implanted 100 embryos into 50 macaque monkeys , - they didn 't get one birth . - David , you 've always said whoever succeeded at human cloning would do it under the radar . Under the radar , not right under our noses . There 's only one person who could have done this . Olivier Roth . - I have to go now . - Are you okay ? Bob ? I need some air . Hey , Bob . What 's wrong with Bob ? We need to find Roth . I 've been in touch with all the US Intelligence agencies . Three words : Osama Bin Laden . I want you to find him . Sure . Can I take off my coat off first ? Nina ? You home ? Hey , here you are ... I went to the hospital , why didn 't you call me ? I would have picked you up . It 's gone . My Jacobson 's Organ . But that 's what we wanted . But you can 't have a functioning Jacobson 's organ and your sanity . You did . My Asperger 's somehow ... It filtered ... I don 't know ... The monkeys couldn 't , you couldn 't ... Anyway , I don 't have it now either . Don 't you miss it ? Yeah . All my life , I 've felt isolated . Well Asperger 's , by definition , is isolation . Then you know the feeling of finally realizing people are communicating all the time . There 's this whole conversation of pure emotion . And I was in on it . For the first time , I understood other people . And now it 's gone . - Our son will have it . - Genetically that 's not ... Our son will have it because ... Our son is my clone . Clone ? When ? How ? ! Roth must 've done it when he activated your Jacobson 's organ . Nina , did you know anything about this ? No . Of course not . If I did , I would have told you . I knew you wouldn 't be involved in something like this . Will our baby be okay ? - There 's so much that can go wrong ... - I promise I will do everything I can . I never thought I 'd have a baby ... I was hoping you 'd say that . Hey Carlos . - What 's all that ? - Samples from Moldova . Where 's David ? I think he 's in his office . Are you okay , Bob ? - Hi . - Hey . I got your message . Yeah , come on in . How you doing ? How 's Nina ? She 's good . Everything 's alright . Good . Bob we have to talk about ... We have to talk about your clone . You mean my son . No , I mean your clone , Bob . Come on . A son is where two people mix their DNA and create something genetically unique , to evolve the species . A clone is static . No . He 'll have his Jacobson 's organ awakened . It 's evolution , David . Radical , but it 's still quintessentially Darwinian . The first human clone . A million mistakes could 've been made . - Except Roth 's team got it right . - Yeah , he and his team have a great track record . All the tests on the baby are normal . Do you want a list of the things that can go wrong - for which there is no test ? - You have to have faith , David . - Faith in science . - " Faith in science " ? Science has nothing to do with faith . Science is about facts . Okay , so , fact : clones are more prone to disease . Fact : it 's been shown that clones have tendency to age faster . So even if he 's healthy , he could just end up dying young . Bottom line is ... what 's in Nina is nothing more than a ... spin the wheel , freak show , science experiment . Don 't do this to yourself . Don 't do this to Nina . You have to consider termination . Nina and I have already discussed it . And what Mr. Roth did was a horrible thing . Not asking us was inexcusable . But to improve the species permanently , he needed to do this . So in a funny way , I thank him . For impregnating your girlfriend ? Most guys would be a little pissed off at that ! Did Nina really have no idea about this ? So Roth just ... what ? He knocked her out and knocked her up ? There 's a word for that , Bob , you think about it . - I promised Nina I 'd be right home . - I want to talk to her . Why don 't the two of you come over for dinner tonight ? - No , she doesn 't want to talk about it . - I just want to ask her some questions . Neither do I. Bob . David . I have something . Took you long enough . How 's Bob handling things ? Sometimes I think the human species is genetically programmed to look at the bright side of any disaster . You never met my grandmother . Okay , so Roth . I 've discovered that he has this corporate jet that he uses to fly down to the Turks Caicos . - He 's got a place there ? - An island . - Is he there now ? - I don 't know . - Well , Mayko . - Okay , hold on second . Look . Whenever he comes or goes , he has to file a flight plan - with customs and immigration . - Good . Get that information . - I got that information . - Is he there ? It 's more complicated than that . Here , look at this . US satellite photos of the island . They 're taken every time KH-13 flies over . - K-what ? - Keyhole-13 , - a spy satellite over Cuba . - The US spies on Roth ? Wouldn 't you ? Anyway , Turks Caicos are on the same trajectory as Cuba , so every time they pass over . US spies on the guy , and Riddlemeyer can 't find him . I knew that fucking vampire was full of shit . Riddlemeyer works for Riddlemeyer . Okay , photos . Is he there ? 'Cause I can be down there in 3 hours . It 's definitely his jet . It 's going to take me another day to confirm that 's him beside it . Fuck ... What ? Lilith ! Hey , how are you ? Everything alright ? That 's amazing . What are you gonna study ? Molecular biology or molecular biology ? Hang on , there 's somebody at the door . Come on in ! The door 's open . Listen , I want to talk to you more about this . So , I 'll call you back . I 'm really proud of you . I love you . Nina . Where 's ... Where 's Bob ? He 's at home . You 're putting a lot of pressure on him . Well , a good friend asks the tough questions nobody else will . A good friend respects the answers he hears . Bob is trying to come to terms with all of this . David , what he needs is your help . And what we need is your support . - I 'm the one carrying the baby . - No , Nina , you 're the one carrying the clone . Bob 's clone that Roth put inside you . - I didn 't know about the clone . - Yeah ? You and how many other women ? What , you think you 're carrying the only clone ? Here 's what I think ... I think after Roth realized that his dream of spreading empathy by waking up people 's Jacobson 's organs turned out to be a fucking nightmare , he gave up on it . Just dropped it . But not before coming up with another plan . If he couldn 't give us empathy individually , he was gonna just change the entire human species by breeding empathy into us using Bob 's clones . Why play street craps , when you can buy the whole fucking casino , right ? - How many women had this procedure ? - I don 't know what he 's done . - You haven 't been in touch with him ? - Look , I don 't know what Roth is up to . All I know is , I 'm having a baby , that 's what I 'm concerned about . I hope we never see Roth again ! And if this keeps up , I 'm gonna start hoping we don 't see you . So , preliminary samples from Moldova all came back negative . No signs of a known infectious agents : viral or bacterial . - What 's in the charts ? - Like Jack said , fever , difficulty breathing , convulsions , paralysis . That could be anything . I checked for Japanese encephalitis , diphtheria . - Poisonous plants ? Spider bites ? - All negative . - Parasites ? - I tested for the ones I think of . Maybe something in the environment . A poison ? The mass spec didn 't show anything . But the sudden onset of symptoms would suggest it 's viral . Jack said there was some bleeding , maybe hemorrhagic fever ? All negative . This is very difficult to do 10,000 kilometers away . No argument here . I 'll see if I can 't get us some more data . Okay . - You get my message ? - Yeah , what 's up ? Okay , good news is , Roth was on his island . Bad news is , he left it 24 hours ago and landed in New York . That narrows it down . And here 's the interesting thing . Over the last three months he 's had this revolving door of people visiting him . - Like , five , ten at a time . - Mostly women ? No , mostly suits . I 've identified some predominantly politicians . Big shots , eh ? So what are they up to ? I don 't know , David , but I know who you can ask . Nina ... Sure looks like her . Yeah . What about that flight plan Roth 's got to file with customs and immigration ? - We know for sure ? - All the names are aliases , - we have to rely on the photos . - Ah , shit ... Now Roth 's plane picks people up in Miami , okay ? Look at the date . It 's the ... It 's the weekend that the terrorists ... She told Bob she was going to visit her father in Michigan . And I found her on an Air Canada flight to Miami . And I 'm pretty sure the woman next to her is Sheila Woo . Why is that name familiar ? She was on the team that did the primate cloning in Oregon . Last night , Nina told me she had no idea what Roth was up to . Here she is three a a half weeks ago , next to a cloning expert in Miami . Find Woo , ask her what the hell she 's doing . David . What ? It 's important . Jack just sent this . Carlos , David , I wanted to thank you for helping . We finally figured it all out . It 's Japanese encephalitis . We 've already started treatments and are seeing results . So , thanks again , guys . Okay , so what ? It can 't be Japanese encephalitis . First of all , there 's no treatment for it . And I tested for the virus . It came back negative . - What are you telling me for , tell him . - That 's my point , David . Jack would know that . I think he 's trying to send us some kind of message . What ? I don 't know , but he 's not answering his phone . And no one 's heard from him or any of the other doctors in over 24 hours . What do you want to do ? - I wanna go . - To Moldova ? ! Something 's not right here . I think Jack 's in some kind of trouble . Make it quick ! - And keep in touch ! - Thank you . Yes ? Nina . Carlton Riddlemeyer . Perhaps Olivier Roth has mentioned me ? I think it 's best if you invite me in . Have you spoken to Olivier recently ? No . Have you tried to call him ? He 's hard to reach . You 're about to have the world 's first human clone , and he 's hard to reach ? Nina , you 're going to be the most controversial woman on this planet . Who 's gonna be there to help you ? To protect you ? Bob and I will be fine . Bob ? You have absolutely no idea what 's coming , do you ? The legal , ethical , political battles ? I can help you , Nina . Mr. Roth is gonna do that . Is he ? We should take a little trip to see Mr. Roth . Afterwards , I think you might just change your position . - I don 't know ... - Bob . - It 's a funny angle . - It 's her . Maybe . We have proof that she flew from Toronto to Miami when she said she was flying to Michigan , and we have proof that Roth 's plane flew to Miami the same day . Presumably to pick her up . Even if she met with Mr. Roth ... So ? So she lied to you , Bob . What else has she been lying about ? Maybe she knew she was carrying your clone all along . All I ever wanted was to have a child and never thought I could have one . This is the best thing ever . And don 't say it 's not a real child . Fine , but we need to talk to her . She should tell us everything she knows . Yeah , she should bring us to Roth so we can find out what he 's up to . Right ? Bob ? I love her so much , David . Alright . We 'll talk to her . But please ... be civil . Please ? Let me do the talking . Sometimes you come on a bit strong . Fine . Nina ? Nina ? She 's not here , David . This isn 't like her . She wouldn 't just leave . Maybe she went out to buy some pickles . She 's gone . She 's gone . Don 't panic . Call her cell . She 'd never leave without this . Unless she went somewhere where she didn 't wanna be reached . Dr. Serrano . - Emil Lupu . - Thank you for seeing me , Sir . - How may I help you ? - Jack Bowden is an old friend of mine . He 's asked NorBAC to assist in a disease outbreak in Birku . News must travel slowly . It 's been solved . I heard . The thing is , I can 't seem to find Jack or any of the other doctors . They 're not at the hotel , have not returned home . No one seems to know where they are . On another project , perhaps ? I was wondering if perhaps they had returned to Birku ? No . I would like to go there . Monitor how things are going . Look . There 's 412 people dead . A thousand people sick . The town has been sealed until we are sure that the outbreak has been extinguished . The problem I 'm having is that I cannot find Japanese encephalitis in any of the blood or tissue samples that were sent to me . The problem has been dealt with . We 're done . The symptoms do not match the disease . Our doctors assure us that it 's Japanese encephalitis . And I have full confidence in their assessment . Sir , NorBAC is respected throughout the world . So is Moldova . Well , did he let you in ? - Yeah . - So you see the problem . I told him we could help him . - He wouldn 't listen . - It 's too late for Roth . - It 's not too late for us . - What do you mean ? You 're carrying a human clone that will have its Jacobson 's organ intact . The research and methodology of such an accomplishment , well , is invaluable . - We didn 't do it for the money . - Of course not . You do know where the research is , don 't you ? Even if I did , why would I tell you ? We both want a new future . Aren 't you supposed to be working on Roth ? - I 'm working on it right now . Look . - Hey , what 's this ? You won 't like it , it 's organic and vegetarian . You 're right . - Hey , Sheila Woo , the cloning expert . - Yeah . She was killed in a car accident . How convenient . Come on in , Bob , it 's open . Nina , come in . I 'm just looking for Bob . He 's been looking for you everywhere . Where you been ? I needed some time to think things out ... You were right , David , about everything . It was all a horrible , terrible mistake . Roth ... the stem cells , the clone . I had ... I had an abortion . Look , I 'm sorry . But you did the right thing . I worry about how he 's gonna take it . He 'll be happy to see you . Will you be happy to see him ? I love him , David . Sure . I saw Roth . - What ? Where ? - He needs help . This is the address of the hotel . In Hoboken . Under the name Hughes . Cute . Hang on . Shit . I gotta take this . Don 't go anywhere . - What ? - It 's me . - Hey , did you find Jack ? - No . The police claim he 's a sex tourist on a bender , that he 's gonna show up in a few days . It 's complete bullshit . What are you certain of ? I went back and retested the original samples - and I noticed something weird . - What ? The results from all the different patients were identical . Don 't tell me you 're dealing with clones too . So I did some genetic testing and confirmed that all blood , tissue and urine samples came from one individual . - It 's a snow job . - Exactly . Troops shut down all the roads into Birku . Telephone lines are down . Get the fuck out of there . Don 't worry . The embassy knows I 'm here . - Carlos ! - I can 't leave until I find Jack . Okay , I 'll keep you posted . Hello ? Carlos ! This is the address of the hotel . In Hoboken . Under the name Hughes . Cute . Hang on . Shit . I gotta take this . Don 't go anywhere . David , I 'm sorry I 'm ... Bob ! Nina . I 'm sorry . I left without saying goodbye . - It 's okay . You 're here now . - We have to go . - Go ? Why ? - I 'll explain on the way . - Nina , what 's going on ? - You have to trust me . - You lied to me before . - Bob ! Listen . I worked at one of Roth 's labs . He wanted to make the world a better place . So I agreed to have a clone . Your clone . But that was before I ever met you . - You should have told me . - You 're right . I should have . We need to find David . He 'll know what to do . Where is he ? I told David I had an abortion . I didn 't . He 'll never appreciate what 's been done . A child who can feel another 's pain . - And happiness . - You had it , I had it . We both know how important it is . I just don 't know , Nina . This child inside me has two parents . We 're the only ones who truly love him . So , where are we going ? Somewhere where no one can find us . And have our baby , and who knows , maybe we can live happily ever after . Come on . Okay . Nina ? - Carlos ? - It 's Mayko . I got something for you . - What ? - You better come in . No , I gotta get to the airport to catch the 1st flight to Newark . - I found Roth . - You 'll wanna see this , believe me . On my way . Hello . Mayko , I don 't have much time . I need you to do me a huge favour . Speak . That KH-13 satellite you were telling me about , does one go over Moldova ? Or nearby . There 're old Soviet military sites all over that region that NATO still monitors , why ? I need sat photos of Birku . I can 't get anyone to take me . There are rumors of something going on up there . People are scared . What is going on over there ? Does David know about this ? Please do it . I just heard from Carlos in Moldova . I told him to get out of there . What 's he doing ? - Dunno , being Carlos . - What about Roth ? OK , Roth 's visitors . Politicians . Top 20 are the ones I can identify with certainty . The Palestinian PM Pakistani General . The Venezuelan Foreign Minister . Russian Defense Minister . Congolese rebel leader ? He 's got all the world 's hotspots covered . What the hell is he up to ? I 'm assuming he 's not impregnating their wives with Bob 's clone . If this helps : the visits began right after we found Bob . Fuck ... What ? Son of bitch ! What did you do to him ? I have enormous respect for Dr. Melnikov and his accomplishments . You mean his Jacobson 's organ . - You harvested his stem cells , right ? - At his insistence . He was a mess , you took advantage of him . Unfortunately , his work to awaken the Jacobson organ in others was unsuccessful . - No shit . - When I heard he was injured ... - Because of a hole you cut in his head . - I wanted to make sure he had everything he needed . I 'm telling you the truth . I am not the enemy here , Dr. Sandström . He didn 't give up . He didn 't drop it . This isn 't about clones . This son of a bitch has gone ahead and activated - these people 's Jacobson 's organ . - My God . So the Russian Defense Minister whose finger 's on the button of the world 's second largest arsenal of nukes may be about to go insane ? How the fuck are we gonna get him in a hyperbaric chamber ? Roth knows him . Maybe he can do it . After the first 20 , there 're 82 more names of people I think were there but I can 't say for certain . You know what ? Screw it . I 'll get the real list from Roth . - Carlos Serrano . - Hey , Carlos , I sent you some photos an hour ago . Yeah , I just got them . I 'm looking at them now . - It 's unbelievable . - Look , I 'm no expert , - but it sure looks like ... - They were massacred . Certainly not a Japanese encephalitis outbreak . No . It 's dangerous knowledge , Carlos . How are you gonna play it ? I don 't know . I have to think about it . - Let me call you back . - Okay . What the hell are you doing ? I have news . We found your friends . The doctors . Where are they ? In jail . - Why ? - They were found guilty . Of what ? ! When was the trial ? - They will be executed in three days . - This is crazy ! Those are WHO doctors investigating an outbreak ! Doctors . Agitators . Interfering in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova . Like you . Are you a doctor or a spy ? And here 's the answer . Just trying to figure out what happened in Birku . That 's all . - Simply a reminder to my people . - Reminder of what ? That my benevolence cannot be questioned . Roth . Come in , David . Come in . The stem cells . The empathy . Nothing worked . It 's all a mess . How many world leaders got Bob 's stem cells ? 176 . What about Bob 's clones . How many of those are out there ? Just one . I tried to make the world a better place . Roth ? Roth ! We can still stop this . The world leaders . What are their names ? Everything I do turns to shit . Everyone I touch , dies . My son-in-law ... I lost my own daughter . We can save everyone who got the stem cells . - Too late . - No . We put them in the hyperbaric chamber . - Treat them . You too . Just like Nina . - Then my friend will be gone . Where 'd he go ? Roth . Stay with me . Roth ! - The names ! - It 's too late . - What do you mean ? - The storage facilities ... The labs ... Head office . Everything . I had it all burned . - Why ? ! - Riddlemeyer . I had to stop him ! I had to destroy it all . He was trying to steal my research . Whoa ! Hey ! Roth ! Take it easy ! Take it easy , alright ? Please . Just put that down . Alright ? Put it down . No ! Wait ! - What are you doing here , man ? - Hey Jack . - You okay ? - Yeah . Not really . Come sit down . Watch your head . - What the fuck is going on , Carlos ? - Emil Lupu . Minister of Health , he cleansed Birku . What do you mean " cleansed " ? Gas . Sarin gas , I think . There are 10,000 people in that city . Not anymore . He was supposed to be progressive . Western educated ... What the hell happened ? I don 't know . I don 't know , Jack . Where you going ? You aren 't gonna believe what happened . You didn 't hear the news ? { \ - Roth . } - No , Carlos . He was arrested . - What ? ! I 'm on my way to a meeting with FA and the Mexican Ambassador . Maybe you should come . - Did you call Riddlemeyer ? - He 's upstairs . Waiting for you . The list of world leaders . I 'm up to 91 . Check out number 89 . - Who 's Emil Lupu ? - Moldovan Health Minister . Shit . - Where the hell have you been , Carl ? - Trying to get answers for you . - Like fuck you have . I found Roth . - Bad ? - Dead . - Bob and Nina , where are they ? - I have no idea . - This cloning research up in smoke ... - We 've important things to worry about . 176 world leaders all underwent the same procedure as Nina and Roth . Roth reactivated all the Jacobson 's organs . We don 't keep them from going insane , who knows what they 'll do to the planet . Alright , I 'll get my people on it . But first , you 'll help me , right ? Bob and Nina are carrying the most important breakthrough in the evolution of mankind . I need that information . This is about money for you ? - Jesus , the world is on the brink here ! - I 'm trying to strike a bargain . There 's Nothing to bargain with , nothing 's left ! There 's Bob and Nina . I want them . Fuck you . No . Fuck you . How are you gonna get to these world leaders without me ? I put you on a No Fly List and you 're not able to leave Toronto . You need me . David ! Sandström ! - Hello , David . - Hello , Bob . What are you doing here ? Nice to see you too , Nina . Still pregnant , eh ? - We need to get going . - Hang on a sec , just cut me some slack , alright ? You 're not the easiest people to find . You look tired , David . Bob , let 's take a walk . We really have to get going , David . - Bob ? - No ! It 's okay . I won 't be long . Human cloning is illegal . In some parts of the world . - So is abortion . - You know what you 're doing is wrong . Both morally and ethically . - I 'm coming to terms with it . - Coming to terms with what ? The whole notion of an empathic human race is nothing more - than a bad science fiction movie . - No , it 's not . You ever read a little book called Frankenstein ? Nina and I , we 're not giving up on this . When our boy grows up , he 'll have within him the power to spreading gifts - throughout the world ... - You 've already got Johnny Appleseed knocking up the entire planet . Don 't be crude , David . You 're talking about my son . At least come back with me , okay ? Come back to the lab . I have to go , David . Bob , I am not gonna let you do this . Yes , you are ! What have you done ?

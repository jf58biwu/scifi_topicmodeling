 The Tribe of Iron ... They should be destroyed . Fire !

There are just too many of them ! R-Retreat ! No way are we getting involved in the Nodos ' fight ! How could you so easily abandon someone who fights for you ? Spread out ! We 're going to get caught in it ! Second engine damaged ! Second engine damaged ! This is not good ! I can 't shake them off ! Beginning with the fleets on the front line , have them retreat in sequence ! All the fleets in the rear , cover for them with everything you 've got ! Access the tactical database . Our first priority is to match their fighting power ! Roger . What 's going on with Belcross ? Engaging in battle with the Tribe of Bronze on the satellite orbit . To think there 's no way to let him know our strategy ... When I helped out Karkinos , that fifth one didn 't try to fight him anymore . He doesn 't really want to destroy anything ... But he 's standing at the forefront of the Tribe of Iron . Even being unable to get any help from his own people ... All by himself ... Why ? It must be because that 's his agreement . I wish there were no agreements ... Age ... What do you think you 're doing ? ! Let all the units make a charge at the enemy ! It is unforgivable to keep on humiliating ourselves like this in the presence of an ancient god ! But our priority is to make sure we can match their forces . We 'll drag them into a chase along Jupiter 's orbital path for about 1 / 8 of a cycle . Are you telling me to run away from them for three months ? I would use the main cannon if I were you . Main cannon ? Set fire to Jupiter by dropping that moon onto it . The thing 's turned into a Tribe of Bronze hotbed , anyway . What did you just say ? Even the Tribe of Silver 's fleet will be damaged by a burst of energy on that scale . But that will cause damage to our fleet , too ! Some damage is inevitable . Do you want us to destroy a planet of the solar system with our own hands ? Fine ! Get ready to fire the main cannon ! Your Majesty ! I don 't want to harm the planet of an ancient holy god , either . But we just can 't show our back to the enemy . The Nodos is in the middle of a battle in Jupiter 's magnetic field ! Something like this wouldn 't kill the Nodos , anyway . What are you basing that on ? ! Ready to fire the main cannon ! Target the moon Io ! Move all the fleets off the orbit now ! I 'm rescinding that order ! Do not fire no matter what ! You bitch , what are you doing ? Explain yourself . Not only will we damage our own allies , you 're talking about humankind harming that planet ! You could end up completely demoralizing all the soldiers ! I see . Big Brother ! Nilval Nephew has gotten scared , Atalantes . She just couldn 't take the pressure of executing the operation ! She 's now removed from her post . Get her out of here . Considering your popularity among soldiers , I won 't get you arrested . You 'd better be thankful for that . How foolish ! Beginning deployment of the cannon barrels . Activating gravity antiparticle accelerators from No. 1 to No. 12 . No errors detected in any of the sensors . Building gravitational prism . Energy path , normal conduction confirmed . Just like the princess said , this is a large-scale state of war . Jupiter and Mars ... I guess they won 't be able to get by without being affected by this fight , huh ? I wonder if that fleet can really burst through by itself ... We have no choice but to place our hope in our Nodos . And who in the world is going to help Age then ? What 's the matter ? Something is ... Something ? Something is about to begin ! Something very frightening ... Accelerators ready to go . All blocks check . Finished deploying the cannon barrels . Terminating amplifier activated . Braking rocket , explosive cartridge loaded . " When the planet dies " ... Main cannon , ready to fire . All right ! Big Brother . Fire ! Io , beginning to fall ! The Tribe of Bronze factions that were inside are now running away . Their own planet ? Is that the reason why the Tribe of Silver is trying to destroy them ? Deploy ! Dhianeila-sama ! - -Princess ! - -Princess ! What 's happening ? ! Age ... Age ! Look at that ! They 're scattering . That was a brilliant strategy , Atalantes . Thank you , Big Brother . We 've lost sight of the Nodos ! I believe he got caught in the explosion ! Find him ! We still need that monster to do more work . Don 't let this chance slip away ! Get into formation and charge at the enemy ! Charge at the enemy right after the fleet just got torn apart ? Those idiots ... As long as the ship can hold itself together , keep on sending this horrible sight to the Argonaut ! Push it back ! What ? ! J-Jupiter is ... Atalantes ! Th-The Tribe of Silver 's interference wasn 't in the database ! Sooner or later there will be a panic . And we 'll take that opportunity to take over the ship , then make all the surviving fleets withdraw from this area . Got it ? The Tribe of Iron ... You choose to perish along with those foolish ones , Belcross ? Go , Karkinos ! Karkinos entered the battle . I shall begin as well . - -If it 's too hard ... - -Hmm ? I 'll do it . After all , Lecty , you 're a girl ... I 'll do it . I will be fine . Thank you . This is the latest info from Nilval . As you can see , as a result of King Meleagros ' choice of orders ... Jupiter was destroyed . What have they done ? D-Dhianeila-sama ! Your condition- - Princess , may I ask why you 're here ? To find out what happened . I knew that you were secretly communicating with Commander Nilval . My brothers did this , didn 't they ? It seems that the Federation fleet has sustained significant damage . The whereabouts of our Nodos are unknown , as well . We must immediately rebuild all the units and reorganize the fleet . Princess , seventeen Federation fleets , including everyone who reports to Lieutenant General Nilval , and the units from neutral star systems , have already secretly agreed to obey your orders . Are you telling me to carry out a coup d 'Ã©tat ? Now ... Now is not the time to do that . I 'm sure many damaged fleets will try to come back . We must take them all in at any cost , and try to save as many lives as possible . Let 's move the rear units to the terminal planet on the front lines right away and have them get ready for a rescue operation . I 'm coming , too . Please get the Argonaut ready to move out immediately ! Yes , Princess ! Traffic map complete . Entering the route to our destination . Setting warp with acquired horoscopes . Begin warp process . To think the princess , who 's been afraid to touch others ' minds , came into a room full of people ... She didn 't turn down the plan itself . The awakening of our star is near , Nilval . Are you still out there fighting all by yourself , even after the fleet abandoned you ? Age ... I feel the presence of Age . We should have stayed with him instead of letting him go by himself . Do you think I am arrogant for feeling that way ? I didn 't even try to stop him ... That man who fights alone ... Personally , I think he chose to do so for you , Dhianeila-sama . What ? May I tell you something ? Sure . Please stop pretending . We will all gladly go with you on the path that you choose . Yes , Aneasha . All sails down . Activating dimension ripper . This fleet is now moving out to rescue the Federation fleet . All ships warp in ! No matter how enormous its strength is , nothing can go against the flow of time . Not against the power of my Erymanthos ... Right there ! We 're going to jump , Erymanthos . Go back to seventy seconds ago !

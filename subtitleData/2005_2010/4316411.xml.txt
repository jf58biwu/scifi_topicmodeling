 Will papa get better ? Yeah . He will , yeah . He won 't wake . I kept trying . How do you sleep at night ? I support an entire village in Chiapas . - What do you do ? - What do I do for Mexico ? Hey ! Take it easy ! There 's millions of migrants working on farms in this state . You can 't turn it around all by yourself . Tell them to send everything they have and then ... Oh God , are you okay ? No , Bob . Just leave it . What 's wrong Bob ? Everything is fine Weston . If there 's something wrong with my eyes , I can 't do my job . And this lab , it 's all that I have . I 'm really scared , David . Goddamn . More lightning . Spark a few more fires . I wish it would rain with some of these storms . Shit , look ! Is he alright ? Jesus ! What 's on your face ? Those aren 't burns . What 's wrong with your face ? Hey , you talk to immigration ? Yes . Elvia is back in Mexico with her grandmother and cousins . That 's what she wanted , right ? That 's all she had left . You still feel like hitting something ? Yeah . You know , sometimes I feel like the world is just ... - pushing me into a corner . - I hear that . Feel like ya gotta do whatever ya gotta do to get out of it . Yeah . But assaulting a federal officer 's not the best way to go about it . I know that . Hey . You want the name of my therapist ? Doctor Lowen ? Right over there . Doctor Lowen ? David Sandström . Carlos Serrano . - Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . Alex . Thanks for coming . Your alert to the CDC got our attention , so we take a first-hand look . Well normally , I 'm dealing with smoke inhalation , fatigue , dehydration , but this ? - I don 't know what to do . - Can I have a look ? - Yeah , please . Here . - Thank you . Those aren 't burns , are they ? And they all came in with these initial symptoms ? Localized infections . Ulcerations . Mostly of cuts and scratches . You get pretty dinged-up out there , even in the protective gear . - Where 're you keeping the sick ? - Down at a station house in Benton - about 5 clicks from here . - They 're all like that ? It gets worse . Pneumonia , infection in the lobes of the lungs . Looks like pulmonary abscesses as well . Those are a couple days old , from the first guys who came down with it . How they doing ? 3 have developed septicemia , 19 others are at various stages , and 2 are dead . - You 're treating them with ? - Mainly antibiotics . We 're having a limited success with tetracycline . So what makes you think it 's noncommunicable ? Five firefighters carried the sick to base camp . They 're not showing any symptoms . Doesn 't make you want to break into song , but it 's a little ray of sunshine . Any thoughts ? We 'll get some samples back to our lab and have a look at them . I appreciate the help , guys . The wind changes , we 're gonna need all the healthy bodies we can get . - How many are out there right now ? - Last count I heard was close to 600 . Doctor Lowen ? Lowen , go . We got three more down , Doc . In transport . Make that close to 597 . ReGenesis 3x08 Sleepers Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Bbsiocnarf , Linwelin , Lovechange Version NoTag 1.0 Look up . Right . Left . Yeah . Thank you . You think therapy might be a good idea ? No . Cuz I got the number of a really good one if you want it . I 'm not comfort discussing my personal affairs - with complete strangers . - How else would you do it ? I 'd rather go to confession . You in a closet with a priest ? I don 't know . It 's like having a paid friend , you know . Somebody who gives you what you need and then when your hour 's up , you don 't have to see them again . Wait , that 's a prostitute . - Is that it ? - Yes . Blood from the victims , by name - and date of exposure . - Do a progressive comparison - from latest to earliest infection . - Anything specific I 'm looking for ? We have to check for all viruses . Noncommunicable , pox-like lesions . If you want to prioritize , - start with poxviruses . - Got it . I 'm not gonna force you to do it . But this can 't become an issue . I 'll give you my word . I 'll never hit another immigration officer again . I 'm not saying that . I mean , if the guy hits you first , or treats you like that asshole did in California ... Maybe I need to get back into therapy . - I 'll give Rachel a hand . - Alright . - David ? - Hey Wes , want a subscription to Bride 's Magazine ? B.C. called . Looks like it 's spreading . Take a look at this . It 's a map of the burn region . - What am I looking at ? - These are the 2 areas where they think the men were infected . That 's pretty far apart . Nobody was infected anywhere in between ? No . Two completely distinct areas . It 's almost like they were encountering pockets of something . Shit . Okay , thanks Wes . Hey Bob . How 'd it go ? - Fine . - Fine ? - Fine . Bob ? - They don 't know yet . Come on . I have high intra-ocular pressure and an increased cup-to-disc ratio . The optic nerve in both eyes is degenerating . It 's progressive and irreversible . - Okay . - Stage 3 glaucoma . Ah , okay . They 're putting me on a cocktail . Eye drops . They won 't work . I 'm going blind , David . I 'm sorry . Sorry , why ? We 're not gonna let this happen , Bob . I was thinking I should take a leave of absence . Stop , alright ? Well , I just don 't trust myself anymore . You know , what if I drop something or ... If you 're worried about bench work , okay , we 'll get a trained fucking supermonkey to do that crap . What I want is your mind . Okay ? Your thoughts . We 'll work this through . Yeah , fine . - Craig ! - Mom ! Oh . What are you doing here ? I am on my way up to Algonquin . I was gonna call but I don 't have your numbers . Yes , you do . I emailed them to you last week . They were in my cell phone . - You lost another cell phone ? - Nice new digs . Very nice . Yeah . Come on , I 'll show you around . Great . Just what I need . Blackberry spam . - Hey David , this is my son , Craig . - Hey , how 's it going ? - Good . - You 'll have time to visit later . Your mom 's got some PCRs to get running . This thing is getting out of control . - We really need to get on it . - Okay . - I 've got to go back to work . - I just stopped by to say I was here . Oh perfect ! Mayko ! This is Mayko . This is Rachel 's son , Greg . Show him a good time . - But we 'll meet for dinner , right ? - Anything but Persian . - It 's nice to meet you , Greg . - Actually , it 's Craig . - I am her son , though . - Sorry . You met the genius who runs this place . - So what do you have against Persian ? - Just the food . Mayko , I need to look at this blood . I can 't find a tech . I 'll do it . Put it there . - 15 others to prep . - Sure . Carlos Serrano . Rachel 's son , Craig . Nice to meet you . - Same . - Just visiting ? Actually , in transit . - Going where ? - Algonquin park . Studying aggressive bear behaviour up there . - Are you a zoologist ? - Doing post-grad studies . Interesting . - I better get back to work . - Everyone 's busy . - ASAP , Mayko . - Got it . - Wanna check it out ? - Yeah . Really , I didn 't know that bears were aggressive . Typically , they aren 't . So then what 's causing it ? I don 't know . It could be shrinking habitat causing competition for food . Could be something epidemiological . - Could be something genetic , I suppose . - I actually read ... an article not that long ago written by a team at NCU . And they had identified 15 genes that affected aggressive behaviour . - Really ? That 's interesting . - Yeah . Here , have a look at this one . So , which of these bacteria is the bad guy ? That 's the mystery . You know what , it is so weird up there . Even the fires . Like , I was doing field work over by Bella Coola and I 'm ... I 'm taking up too much of your time right now . Could you tell mom I will see her at dinner ? - It 's fine , you don 't have to leave . - No , no . You 're busy . - I 'll see you soon though , right ? - Yeah . Bye . So these are images of the firefighter 's blood . Based on 16S ribosomal RNA analysis , it 's Burkholderia Mallei . - Commonly known as glanders . - I 'm not familiar with it . - It 's a horse disease ? - That 's it . Also carried by donkeys , mules , almost anything equine . - But extremely rare . - Virtually unknown in North America . There 's been what ? One reported human case - in the last 60 years . - So why the comeback ? First tell me how to treat it . It 's not easy . Usually recommended treatment is a combination - of imipenem and doxycycline . - Okay . So how does it end up here ? It 's usually aerosol transmission between an infected animal and a human . Horses ? Mules ? There 's no ranching up here . What about a wild herd ? Infected animal dies . Goes up in smoke . Firefighters breathe it in , or it infects an open lesion ? - It 's possible . - Maybe . But ? I gotta check something out . Remember I said I needed that super cranium of yours ? - David , you don 't have to do this . - I need it now . - What do you want ? - Dig up everything you can for me on glanders . - Am I looking for anything specific ? - Yeah , weaponization . Nice to meet you , Dr. Serrano . Carlos . You too , Craig . So you 're into martial arts ? Yeah , I find it 's a , you know , good way to let off some steam . I just don 't get to the gym often enough . - I spar a bit myself . - Oh really ? I 'm always looking for a good sparring partner . Sounds good . So , later . Yeah , sure . What 'd you find out , Bob ? It 's really quite fascinating . Glanders is one of the oldest forms of biological weapon . Yeah ? In early times , horses infected with it were placed in the enemy 's cavalry to destroy it . - In World War One ... - Bring it up to today , Bob . It 's still present in the 3rd world . There have been rare cases of lab workers and veterinary personnel becoming infected . - What about its use as a weapon ? - It 's believed the Soviets used it - against the Afghanis in the 80s . - Any terrorists using it these days ? No confirmed proof . But , glanders is a good candidate . It 's readily spread , especially in aerosol form . And patients don 't develop immunity . So it can be used on the same population over and over again . Nice . And because it is so rarely seen , no one has ever bothered to make a vaccine . You mean , there was no money to be made making a vaccine . That 's a cynical conclusion . - What ? - Dr. Sandström ? - It 's Alex Lowen . - Yeah . I got people coming in here with something that isn 't glanders . What are they presenting ? Smaller blisters , black in the centre , surrounded by redness and swelling . You know what you 're describing , right ? Yeah . Anthrax . What the hell 's going on up here ? Dots represent the areas where the firefighters most likely contracted the glanders . The crosses represent the anthrax . Both associated with biological weapons . So , what are we looking at ? An attack ? Well , both can be naturally occurring . Doctor Lowen acknowledged that the glanders could have come from animals . And anthrax spores lie dormant in the forest for decades . But there 's only been one outbreak of glanders in the last 6 decades . Yeah , and now it shows up at the same time as an anthrax outbreak . Doesn 't sound very likely . So what other possible explanations are there ? It could be some clandestine germ warfare lab goes up in the fire . I talked to Homeland Security about that . If there was a lab , - it wasn 't American or Canadian . - How can you be sure of that ? The American government has been less than truthful with us before , Weston . The Americans have the best germ lab in the world at Fort Egan . - Why wouldn 't they just do it there ? - And Canada has no germ program . So they say . My problem with that is the dispersal pattern . With a single lab , we 'd have a central source . These are all over the place . More like they 've been planted . - Yeah . - But that would mean somebody would have had to have known about the fire . It was set . You 're talking terrorism . Yeah , Wes . That 's exactly what we 're talking . And the forest , it 's a massive biological weapon . Come on , we gotta make a phone call . If this is terrorism , the question is how are the pathogens being deployed ? With biological weapons they have an aerosol-based delivery system . In this case , there 's no explosion , no flybys . - The fire is the delivery system . - How 's that ? The bacteria gets picked up by the convection of the fire and then carried by the smoke . Firefighters get in contact with the air currents . The wounds get infected . They take off their masks , they inhale the bacteria , it gestates in the lungs and attacks the pulmonary system . Why firefighters in the middle of nowhere ? Maybe it was a test run . Every infected firefighter is new data . - Should I give Riddlemeyer an update ? - Yep . - Can we prove it ? - Jesus , Wes . Work with me here . That 's what this is all about . I need some ammo when I call Riddlemeyer . Okay . If those firefighters do have anthrax , they were exposed to the anthrax in its spore stage . So we need to send somebody to B.C. to get a sample of it . Why ? Because you can learn a lot about the makers from those spores . - Maybe even enough to catch them . - How 's that ? Okay . It takes a lot of anthrax to infect a human being . So , if you wanna use it was a weapon , you 've gotta grow a lot of anthrax . You need a growth medium . Now when you go to extract the wet spores from the medium , you get a lot of clumping problems . The medium leaves a residue on the spores . We could trace the chemical makeup of that medium back to a specific lab . Also , different labs use different chemicals to separate the spores . And once you get the spores out of the medium , you gotta dry them off . There 's air , freeze-drying , and heat . Some of the spores might show signs of the process used , also pointing back to a specific lab . And lastly , you 've gotta mill it , so that it 's small enough to infect the lung . We 're looking at a size somewhere underneath 5 microns . Okay ? Class dismissed . A long shot , David . You got a better idea ? No . We need a spore sample , Wes . I 'll bring you back a Sasquatch . - David , there 's something else . - What ? The FBI received an anonymous call . Something about ... a smiley face you might have received . The FBI is investigating smiley faces now ? They 're taking this seriously . Something like this ? Don 't ! I will let you know if it is anything to be concerned about . Okay . And Wes ... Anthrax vaccinations for those firefighters ASAP . Alright . Tap . Quick . Not bad for an old man , eh ? Two out of three ? Okay . I better get that . Okay , if we 're gonna find some of these spores , we 'll wanna look right here . Where your guys likely contracted the anthrax . That area was already burnt over . Well , anthrax is so goddamn tough it can survive even a fire . I 'd like to look for spores on the infected men 's protective gear . Good idea . Okay , so , what about us ? Well , we need samples , so I need a guide . I guess that 'd be me . CSIS didn 't want to take any chances with the package that was sent to David , so I had it shipped out and x-rayed . What do you make of that ? It 's hard to tell what might be in that vial from an X-ray , but ... Room 702 ? - What time ? - I 'll be there around ten . Okay , ten . What should I do with that ? Irradiate it ? I 'll take care of it . Well , that doesn 't work . You 're ... You 're gonna need this . Okay . Could you ? You 've never been on the front line of a forest fire , have you ? It 's a first . Well , listen to your walkie . And know what the fire is doing at all times . 'Cause a doctor , or a molecular biologist , you 're no help to anyone if you get caught in a burnover . Burnover ? Yeah , a burnover . Basically everything is suddenly engulfed in flames . And the thing is , you think the fire is under control one second , and the next ... you 're in hell . Okay . Avoid burnover . Got it . Avoid burnover . Yeah , I think you better see this . Whaddya got ? I 'm gonna run it again . Let 's make sure . Those samples will make it back fine on their own . You don 't have to go . I prefer to put them onto the chopper myself . A cold one will wait for you when you get back . Right . - What the hell is going on here , Doc ? - We don 't know yet . I got a buddy , Jeremy Williamson . - He 's not doing too well right now . - I 'm sorry to hear that . What do we tell his wife ? We 're working as hard and as fast as we can . Sure , but if you don 't figure this out soon , you 're not going to be able to have anyone go close to that fire . Those samples will make it back fine on their own . You don 't have to go . I prefer to put them on the chopper personally . A cold one will wait for you when you get back . Right . Brought you a beer . Thanks . Where 's yours ? I 'm taking a break . - Mind if I join you ? - Yeah , have a seat . So how 're you doing ? You alright ? Yeah . - It sorta hit me since you got here . - What 's that ? You know , that we 're under attack . Someone 's intentionally doing this . Killing people . Why ? What the hell kind of person does something like that ? We 'll probably read in the newspaper next week it was some asshole with a hard-on against the colour of fire trucks . It 's just that getting caught up in a plan that has nothing to do with you ... I know how you feel . Couldn 't have asked for a more beautiful night though ? It 'd be more beautiful if it rained like this for another 4 days and killed the fire . Sorry . I 'm just making conversation . So why don 't you hit on me ? Do you want me to ? You 're avoiding the question . I 'm taking a break . For their sake or yours ? You didn 't answer my question . Yes . But I 'm married . You 're not wearing a band . So you thought about it ? Sometimes it 's good to just have a pal . You better answer that . Excuse me . What ? We got the results on the package that was delivered to you . David , it 's smallpox . - That 's impossible . You made a mistake . - No mistake . Fuck , Rachel . Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 . 1979 , but both the Russian and American military still have stockpiles . I guess somebody 's got a big , bad security problem ? So who would send it to you ? You want an alphabetical list ? Anthrax and glanders on the west coast and now smallpox on the east . I think this is bigger than NorBAC . Actually , this is exactly why NorBAC was put together in the first place . Have Wes book me the first flight home tomorrow morning . Sorry but as soon as the samples get in , it 's gonna get even worse around here . Mam , I 'll stop by on the way back from the park . - Do you promise ? - Yes , I promise . - Okay . - I 'll sign myself out . Okay . - You be careful ? - You too . Okay . See ya . Wow , that was quick . Did he have a good time ? I guess so . He didn 't come home the other night . You were there to know ? I was , yeah . Craig . Hi , dad . What brings you here ? That 's funny ... mom . - Why else would I come here ? - Of course . So how 're you doing ? - Can we not play this game ? - Just asking how you are . I know . I 'm just telling you , I don 't wanna talk . - You 've made your mind up about me . - So trite . Just give me a reason . You . Washington . Missy . That 's three . Now go fuck yourself , okay ? We 've tracked the text message David received . It was sent from a prepaid cell phone , purchased from a kiosk in Peoria . The cell phone company traced the message it was sent from Columbus , Ohio . Well , who is behind this knows David 's cell number . Security and IT figure out how that happened . It might be a business card he handed out . It 's our only way of connecting this person , right ? They 've made no other contact . I 'm sure David won 't mind the FBI monitoring his phone and the internet . He 's convinced they already are . Bob . - Samples from the fire get here ? - Rachel 's already working on them . David , I was thinking while you were gone . Well , since anthrax stays in its spore stage for so long , for decades , it 's slow evolving . - So its genetic heritage is clear . - What are you thinking ? Perhaps the genetic markers might give us a clue as to its geographic origin . Great idea , Bob . You get Mayko on it ? Sure . - Have a good meeting . - Thank you . I was just telling Weston how this whole thing has turned into a shit storm . What 's up ? The Russians are denying that they 're the source of the smallpox . CIA has been telling us for years ... I know the argument . Some lab tech sells a smallpox sample for a crate of vodka , David . I think Mr. Riddlemeyer is just expressing Washington 's position . What is Washington 's position ? General Samuel at Fort Egan personally assures me that their security has not been compromised . You expected him to tell you differently ? Which is why we want you to determine the source of the virus . So ? If we determine which lab is the source , - we 'll be hot on his trail ? - Reasonable course , don 't you agree ? What about the anthrax and the glanders ? - Do they think they 're related ? - Hard to imagine they 're not . Vaccine . Are we making it ? Samples of the smallpox are en route from both Russia and Fort Egan . I suggest you get ready for their arrival . You didn 't answer my question . Are they making vaccine ? Yes . I guess the real question is who 's gonna get it ? May I use your office , Weston ? Yes . Well , as soon as they finish sequencing the anthrax , I 'll see what those DNA markers can tell us . - Thanks , Mayko . - Bob . How are you feeling ? - Actually , I 'm feeling a little better . - Yeah ? Have you noticed that ... Oh God , never mind . What ? Noticed what ? No , just Wes and Rachel . - What about ' em ? - Well they 're ... Never mind . Sorry , Bob . Okay . Thanks . Any updates ? Three more glanders infections . Six more anthrax . One didn 't make it . - Shit . - There 's something else . Great . Long-term weather models suggest that high winds may be coming . And that wind 's gonna blow the smoke somewhere . Where is anyone 's guess . Want you to keep a close eye on it . Any good news ? Well , the rest of the anthrax vaccine did arrive . Well , that 's something . Hang in there . She 's very good . Second-best virologist I 've ever worked with . - Wouldn 't have hired her if she wasn 't . - What exactly is she doing ? She 's doing a genetic alignment comparison . How does that work ? Well ... In order to identify the original virus as smallpox , we had to sequence it . 185 000 nucleotides in the smallpox DNA sequence . There are 400 strains of smallpox . Each one of them has been sequenced , and each of those sequences is stored in the ... World Gene Bank . So , this is available to the public ? Oh yeah . It 's accessible to everyone . Now , each of the strain 's sequences are ... slightly different . The nucleotide is in a different position at some point . So what Rachel is doing is lining up the sequence of our guy 's strain and comparing it to the sequences of the strains sent from Russia and the US . Genetic alignment comparison . She 'll be able to tell us where it came from . And the anthrax and glanders ? Well , there are no military stockpiles of glanders , as you know . So there 's no real point taking a look at that . But the anthrax we should be able to trace . Just like that Ames Strain of anthrax that was sent to Senator Daschle awhile back . - That was stolen ... - From the US army . - Unproven . - We 'll see . We 're already running tests on it . Do you want some ? Herbal . Since when ? Since I started going to my nutritionist . Okay . How 's it going ? It 's like finding a needle in a haystack . I 've got 2 other labs and 4 universities working with me around the clock . And still we 're only a third of the way through . It 's impressive nonetheless . That 's one of those things you never really know about someone . You mean take for granted ? Perhaps . Sensitive . Herbal tea . - What , you turning over a new leaf ? - Maybe . Maybe too late . But I 'm trying . - Craig was here . - Yeah , I know . I saw him . Briefly . - You two should really work this out . - Wanna have dinner , just you and me ? You still like Persian ? No . Seeing someone ? What do you want ? I want you to sign those papers . I see . - Is there some kind of rush ? - Missy 's pregnant . - You mean Melissa ? - Yes . You knocked up your trainer ? You were actually fucking her ? Oh Carl . Come on . I mean , great body . What 's she gonna do at the ranch ? I can just see her doing squats with George and Laura . - You all done ? - No . Do you love her ? Just sign the papers . You know , I 'm actually happy for you . Because you 've got a second chance . Don 't blow it with this kid . Where the forest fires in B.C. continue to rage out of control . And a 14th firefighter has died fighting the blaze . No immediate threat to the greater Vancouver Metropolitan area ... It 's not gonna happen , Bob . It 's alright . I can make it work . I can 't . I want you to go home and get some sleep . We got a lot of work to do tomorrow . Good night , David . Good night , Bob . I 'll clean up that beaker . Okay . Holy mother of God ! Smallpox . But here 's the thing . It 's synthetic . How can you be sure ? There 's a problem with the coding of the strain . Here . Position 72,220 . That G should be an A. It 's an A in every other strain of smallpox except this one . Now , in the early days of sequencing , it was quite easy to make mistakes in the G regions . Is it or is it not deadly ? That 's a very good question , Wes . If it slithers on the ground , has a rattle and 2 big fucking fangs , you check if it 's poisonous ? You found that ? One difference in 185 000 ? Well , I had a little help from a program that Mayko wrote . And it 's in the TK gene which just so happens to be the area of the genome that I used to work on . So I know it by heart . I 'm ... I 'm obsessive , remember ? - How can you be sure it 's synthetic ? - It 's like Rachel says . When this sequence was entered into the World Gene Bank , it was entered incorrectly . This is a ... It 's a typo . This virus isn 't real . What 's that ? What are we looking at ? Well ... Think of yourself as an alien . You find a picture book of horse . and you decide to manufacture a horse , based on the pictures . The book has everything . Palominos , Pintos , Arabians . It even has a couple of pictures of unicorns . But you 're an alien . You don 't know the difference . And with this book as your only reference , they 're all real . So someone built this smallpox genetic code based on a sequence that exists only in cyberspace . So someone can just build smallpox ? Well , theoretically . The technology is relatively straightforward . We manufacture genetic material from chemicals all the time . So when a lab needs DNA , it usually just orders it from another lab that specializes in synthesizing it . We do it here at the lab all the time . It 's cheaper faster . What ? I can 't look at your purchase orders ? Some maniac can just order up smallpox ? No , no . It 's impossible to synthesize DNA as large as the smallpox genome . And there are security measures in place that prevent that from happening . You can , however , order DNA in smaller sequences . Say , 200 nucleotides or less . - There 's no security check for that ? - No . Even though the smallpox virus is 185 000 nucleotides long , it 's made up of combinations of only 4 nucleotides . A , C , T and G. And those combinations can be found in ... other viruses , good bacteria , even humans . So you just order up those . You can 't police that . So what then ? As crude as it seems , you just sew ' em together and wind up with smallpox . Unbelievable . Okay , anthrax and glanders . Could that be synthetic , too ? No . Both are bacteria . They 're far more complex organisms than virus . It would be like the difference between building a skyscraper and a bird feeder . Yeah . Who could pull this off ? Basically anyone qualified to work in a microbiology lab could do it . I mean . And that 's what , 5 000 people in the US alone . - What sort of facilities do they need ? - Any university and lab could do it . Is this guy 's work recognizable ? Like a diamond can leave the signature style when he 's working on a rock ? Completely untraceable . So how do we go about finding this guy ? We don 't have to . He 's found us . Time to go public . He 's going to deploy it . It 's a show of force . Maybe that 's what the anthrax and the glanders were . A show of force . Maybe . Isn 't the more important question : where is it gonna be deployed ? Oh , I have a feeling we 're gonna find that out real soon . He 's in the US . East coast . Manhattan . Censor the net ? A bit late in the day , no ? He synthesized one of the deadliest killers this planet 's ever seen from stuff he got off the internet . Hello . My God . Rachel ! - Where is he ? - They 're still working on him . - What happened ? - They were attacked by some bear - they were studying . - Oh Jesus ! The storm 's north of the Queen Charlotte islands . - Coming ashore ? - It 's just a matter of time . A storm cloud of pathogens is gonna hit Vancouver . Population of 2 million David . - Dr. Sandström . - Robbie . You said you knew who I was looking for . Who is it ? Guy gets gunned down in cold blood in front of my office ! There are issues of national security in play . He was executed ? Who gave the order ? !

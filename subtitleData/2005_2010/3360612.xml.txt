 Previously on Heroes . Peter , I 'm your brother . You gave me this hunger . You made me a monster . Now I can 't control it . I 'm just like you . They want to create a world filled with dangerous people . They will destroy everything . Dad . Come give your father a hug . You don 't have your powers anymore , Peter ... Because I have them now . You are a monster ... I wish you hadn 't said that . We need your help . We can be of great assistance to each other . And you 're sure there 's no side effects ? We came to you for help . What 'd he done to us ? We have not finished yet . Pull the triger . You can 't fight him . That was fun . Show 's over . What is it ? I 'm not sure ... But I 've definitely seen this card before . You 're going to Africa . Precog . He can see the future . Whatever he paints comes true . My boss can 't have someone like that out there . Evil forces gather . The dark sun rises . Soon it will be too late . Will you choose your own path or will you have it chosen for you ? You 've ruined everything . Don 't come any closer . What the hell happened in here ? I 'm trying to help Maya to remove her ability . So you knock us out ? You experiment on us ? Your abilities are synthetic . They may hold the key to creating a cure . If I could have one more sample ... No , it 's finished . We 're done . Dad 's dead . He had a heart attack . Your father , he was deeply flawed in ways you will never know . I can 't believe he 's gone . Dad 's dead . Dad ? You 're dead . Dad 's dead . - He had a heart attack this morning . - Come give your father a hug . I 'm sorry it had to come to this . No ! Take it easy , Peter . Your body is still in shock . You took my abilities . You gave me no choice , son . Are they gone forever ? Yes . How am I supposed to believe any of this ? You 've been dead for over a year . Then I find you preaching to some supervillian gang ? I 'm sorry that I lied to you and your brother , but I 've had to make hard choices for the greater good . Giving everyone on the planet an ability . That 's really your idea of the greater good ? That 's not what I want . That 's what happens . I 've seen the future , dad . I 've seen the whole neighborhood get nuked . You can help me . Together we can make sure that the future you saw ... never happens . Once you understand what I 'm doing ... I 'm not interested in what you 're doing . With or without my powers , I 'm going to find a way to shut you down , and I 'm going to make you pay for everything you 've ever done . Son , until you change that attitude . You 're grounded . You okay ? I think so . Is that weird ? We just starred in a human puppet show . My dad is working with a serial killer . And I can 't feel pain . Claire , the things you deal with . The demons you face , I can 't imagine ... How you handle them . That you stay strong in the face of it all . That makes me proud . Thanks . What 's wrong with the lights ? I 'm going to check the circuit breakers . Lyle ! Oh , my god . What happened ? Are you okay ? Bitch is back . Elle ? Hey , cheerleader . What the hell are you doing here ? Get out of my house . Not until I get what I came for . Fine . Then I 'll throw you out ! Leave me alone ! Why are you here ? I 'm sorry . I need help . And I didn 't know where else to go . I apologize for keeping you waiting , doctor . I 'm Arthur Petrelli . Everyone thinks you 're dead . That was the idea . What could possibly drive a father to put his children through such grief ? Have you met their mother ? How is our patient ? Terrified . She thinks I 'm a monster and has no idea where she is . Nor do I , for that matter . You 're among friends . I promised Maya I would remove her abilities and end her suffering . I will do anything to keep that promise . All you have to do is watch . Get away from me . Get him out of here . You 're telling me all traces of Maya 's ability have been removed from her system . I take it all ... and leave nothing behind . Could you do the same to me ? Is that what you want ? To be normal again ? I injected myself with an unstable formula . Its side effects are changing me into something else , something I don 't understand . I need to find a way to reverse the changes and retain my abilities . This isn 't my formula . The cytologies are similar , but these protein links are enmeshed . Has it been successful ? We 've taken it as far as we can . That 's why we need you . If you can make our version of the formula successful , a fresh injection might be exactly what you need . I 've been down this road before . There is always a hidden agenda . A self serving motivation behind it all . If you don 't want to be here , leave . I 'll need test subjects . Gabriel . Momma . How are you here ? You 're sick . Peter needs your help . Peter doesn 't want anything to do with me , he thinks I 'm just a killer . This isn 't about what he wants . This is about what I am telling you to do . Now stop feeling sorry for yourself and get out of this cell . This is where I belong in a cage . I couldn 't escape even if I wanted to . They 're blocking my abilities . Then how do you explain my being here ? Oh , Gabriel ... You don 't know the half of what you 're capable of . Show them . Show them all why you 're my favorite . Make mommy proud . Don 't worry , mom . I 'll save Peter . Are you going to be okay ? Yeah , fine . I 'm leaving . Is ... there something wrong with you ? I can 't control it anymore . I keep overloading . And I can 't eat , I can 't sleep ... This girl found me , said I should go to this company , Pinehearst . That they knew what was wrong with me and how to get me better . But I 've never heard of it . I didn 't want to go there without knowing what the deal was . And your dad , ... your dad always seemed to be the one with the answers . So home invasion time . What if there 's something wrong with all of us and they can fix it ? You 're fine . You 're perfect . No , I 'm not . Whatever 's happening to you , it 's happening to me , too . You 're still healing , aren 't you ? Yeah . But I can 't feel pain . And I think it 's only a matter of time before I can 't feel anything at all . You can 't feel pain . I wish I had your problems , cheerleader . My body is screaming . I 'm in agony . Go with me . If there 's a chance that these people at Pinehearst can help us , we 'll go together . All right , Dorothy . Then we 're off to see the wizard . Daphne . You have a mess to clean up . I do ? You were supposed to recruit my son , Matt Parkman . Yeah , I gave him the pitch , but he wasn 't buying . I mean , the guy 's a mind reader . Were you thinking something which would discourage him from joining us ? That 's not what I meant . She 's lying . I am not . Then why are you so scared ? How can I fix this ? Revisit Mr. Parkman . But I don 't think he 's going to take the deal . You 're not going there to offer him anything . You 're going there to kill him . What ? I just asked her to kill your son , Maury , is that a problem ? You 're damn right . My loyalty for his safety . That was the arrangement . I 'm a thief . I steal things . There 's no way I could kill anybody . I 'm not going to let you do this , Arthur . You 're not in a position to give me orders . I 'm Matt 's father . Without me , you 'd still be lying ... Thank you , Maury , For all your sacrifice . Please . There has to be another way . But you don 't know anything about this place . Look , Elle needs help and so do I. This Pinehearst place could be our best shot . Pinehearst , sounds like a dishwashing liquid . I gotta call your dad . Mom . Please don 't . Claire , he loves you . I know . But there 's something inside of me , and it 's broken . And he can 't fix it . I think I 'm the only one who can . Do you understand that ? Do you really think you can trust Elle ? No . But we both want the same thing . We need our abilities under control . If she gives you any lip , you just toss a glass of water on her ... lyle style . This is Dr. Mohinder Suresh . I am not available . Please leave a message , and I 'll call you back . Mohinder , it 's Matt . Where the hell you been , man ? I just got back from the craziest week of my life . Uh , do me a favor , give me a call as soon as possible , okay ? Put down the phone . Daphne . What are you doing ? They think that I told you not to come to Pinehearst . That I warned you away . They don 't believe I 'm one of them . - Well , you 're not . - Shut up . If I don 't kill you , they 'll kill me . Shoot . - What ? - Shoot me . Go ahead . If it 's the only way that I can save your life , do it . You think you know me , that I 'm worth saving , but I 've done some bad things . You make up for all that in the future . I don 't have a future ... Unless I kill you , so ... turn around . Do it . We get married . We start a family together . Stop it . We 're going to love each other . I 'm sorry , Matt . It happened so fast , there was nothing I could do . My dad ? So I guess you 're not going to help . Don 't do this , dad . Please , you 're going to destroy the world . I don 't see it that way . You think you 're better than everyone else ? That you have the right to do whatever you want ? Hurt anyone that gets in your way ? I am better , Peter . It 's not a belief , it 's a fact . And one way or another , you will help me get this done . Suresh . Hello , Peter . So you 're helping my father . I prefer to think he 's helping me . And what is that ? Your metabolism is primed to accept abilities . Which makes you the ideal test case for a new version of the formula . I need to perfect it . Wait , wait , wait , when I saw you in the future , you said that manipulating abilities was wrong . That this was all a mistake . Did I ? You were trying to help me , Mohinder . You need to tell me something , in this future of yours ... What do I look like ? There was something wrong with you . You changed . You looked like a monster . Then you 're too late . Suresh , no . Hello , Mohinder . You came for me ? That 's what brothers do , Peter . They look out for each other . Even after I locked you up ? Let 's get out of here . Stop , leave him alone ! He deserves to die . Peter . This is for killing my father . That 's enough . Enough ! Do you know who this man is ? Do you have any idea how many innocent people he 's killed ? I do . But he 's also my son . And I 've been waiting for him for a long time . It 's been hours . Who 'd you talk to over there ? Some guy from the company . He can keep a secret , right ? I hope so . Do you think they 're alive ? Do you think they 're human ? What if they can 't breathe ? Tracy ... We need to help them . Be careful . Oh , god . It 's too tough . I told you not to touch anything . You . Meredith . Nathan . Well , I see you 've still got a weakness for blondes . Everything all right ? I 'm what some people would refer to as an anxious flyer . Big tough company agent can 't handle being 30,000 feet up ? Yeah , well I was never a very good agent . So I read . You , uh , let all those villains escape level five , right ? Shut up . Yeah , I caught Doyle . I helped clean up your mess . Doyle ? Yeah , the freak with the puppets . This agent thing isn 't so hard . You know , my father pushed me into this life . I wanted no part of it . And if you do , you 're an idiot . Elle . You have no idea how good you have it . This is your captain speaking . We 'd like to remind our passengers to turn off all electrical equipment . Thank you . - I think he 's talking about you . - Shut up ! Seriously , calm down . You have to turn it off or we 're going to crash . If I knew how to do that , I wouldn 't be here in the first place . Take my hand . Let me help you . Dump your electricity into me . Do it ! We did it . Do you mind ? My dad and I weren 't even close . To think that he would ever put himself in danger to protect me ... Well , he didn 't do it , so you can sit around here and wait to get killed . What do you mean ? Pinehearst . They 'll be sending someone after me ... to make sure you 're dead . Let them come . Mm , yeah . Great . You 're going to use your brain mojo thingy . Perfect . If you need to go , I understand . But I can 't let them get away with this . I wanna help you . I 'm just scared . So am I. But we can 't let our fears stop us from doing what 's right . I knew you couldn 't kill him . I 'm sorry , Matt . No , stick to the plan . Your fear is making me strong , girl . I can 't . No . No ! Stop . You think you can hold me with a power ? Not only can I hold you , I can kill you . I 'm going to dig inside your head , find your worst fear , and make it eat you alive . I 'm not the one that 's scared . You are . And your fear just makes me strong . Matt ... That was amazing . Yeah , well you know , I got inside his head with my brain mojo thingy . My dad could do the same thing . Now that they think that we 're dead , we have time to get away . No . I told you , I 'm not running . What are you going to do , Matt ? Fight them ? Trick them into killing each other ? That 's not going to bring your dad back . But it will probably get you killed . I 'm a cop . Stopping guys like Knox , that 's what I do . You can 't bring them down by yourself . There 's no way . Even with me at your back , we still need help . There 's a company , Primatech . They know how to deal with situations like this . If anybody can help , they can . Building sealed up tight . If Peter 's still here , he ain 't getting out . Peter 's long gone . If I find him , do you want him crispy or well-done ? Alive , please . I sent somebody to recruit you , when you refused her offer , I didn 't expect to see you here . My mother 's in a coma . Did you do that ? Angela 's not the woman you think she is , Gabriel . She 's done terrible things . So have I , and I 'm going to do them all to you . Has Angela forgiven your sins ? My mother accepts me for who I am . I wonder if you 'll be so generous . What are you talking about ? She sent you here , didn 't she ? To save her favorite son . Did she tell you that you were all going to live happily ever after ? She 's using you , son , as a weapon . A blunt instrument to be manipulated and then discarded . My mother loves me . When you were born , she had one of her dreams . A vision of the future . She saw what you would become ... Yeah , I know this . She told me I 'd become a hero . Did she ? Angela was so terrified of what she saw , so frightened of her own flesh and blood , that she tried to kill you . Imagine that , a mother wanting to murder her own child . I got to the bathroom just in time . She was holding you at the bottom of the tub . It 's time you learned the truth about your mother . That 's far enough . I was told you were leaving . Maybe one day I could forgive you , but after everything that 's happened , I just ... I don 't think I could ever trust you . I know it 's hard to believe , but I was trying to help . My feelings for you were real . Those feelings are still there . What you did in my name was wrong . I wish I could take it all back . I 've done bad things , killed people ... Not by choice , but still ... I did them . I need to make amends . And so do you . Get well , Mohinder . - Ah ! - Hold on . We 're almost there . You all right ? Thank you . For what ? For helping me . I 've been nothing but a bitch . And you 've been nothing but sweet . Really just makes me hate you more . No , I should be the one thanking you . Why ? Because I was ready to give up . Stay home , deny everything that 's been happening to me . I was scared . Scared of what ? What I would find out about who I really am . It 's just ... It 's nice to know that you 're as messed up as I am . Peter , you stayed ? I wasn 't going to leave you . What are you doing sitting here ? Did he take your powers ? No , he told me the truth . You can 't listen to him . But he 's our father . He 's my father . I grew up with him . Oh , and I didn 't , so I don 't get the right to know him . Is that what you 're saying ? He can 't be trusted . You 've seen what he 's done . He hurt mom . He 's manipulated abilities , I know where that leads . The world you saw doesn 't exist . We won 't let it . I 'm sorry , Peter , this is something I have to do . You help him , and you 're proving all the worst things I 've ever said about you . Just kick his ass and let 's get out of here . No , I 'm not going anywhere , Peter . You are . Oh , my god . Peter . What are you doing here ? Why are you bleeding ? He 's not healing . He took my ability . We need to go . Elle , help me get him in the car . Claire ... Did you hear what he said ? That they took his ability . That 's what we came here for . You don 't know what happened up there . I 'm sorry , Claire . Elle ! If you can 't heal , how did you fall that far and not die ? I don 't know . Okay , let me get this straight . She 's the biological mother of your illegitimate daughter , and he 's her adopted father . That sounds about right . Did Suresh inject you with anything ? Yeah , a tranquilizer , why ? What 's he doing in there ? Building a nest . Laying eggs . Who the hell knows ? You 're both going to have to come into the company to be tested . For what ? Just to be sure you 're still normal . So you 're working with him ? For now . Excuse me . Petrelli . I 'd watch out for that one . Oh , we 're not together . Oh . Claire ? Slow down , slow down . Where are you ? No , I won 't tell anyone . Peter 's never going to give up , you know . I would expect nothing less of a Petrelli . Revenge is in our blood . We 're just gonna wait for him to come after us . No , son . We 're going to take our fight to the enemy . How do you suppose Peter survived that fall ? Seven stories without the ability to heal . Hell of a thing . I don 't know . Hello ? It worked . He thinks I 'm on his side . Good job . If he reaches out to Primatech , I 'll let you know what they say . Screw this up , and I 'll put you right back where I found you . I keep thinking about that fall . How I didn 't hit as hard as I should have . What if Sylar didn 't want me to die ? What if ... he wanted to get me out of there alive ? By throwing you out of a window ? No , he could have used his ability to slow me down . I 'm telling you he saved my life , Claire . Claire . It 's all right . She 's good . What happened ? Why aren 't you healing ? I don 't have my powers anymore , Nathan . Dad took them . Dad 's dead . He 's not , he 's alive . I was there , Pete . I saw it ... He 's alive , Nathan . And if we don 't do something to stop him , he 's going to kill us all . That 's just ... that 's impossible , Pete . Dad died over a year ago . He 's the one who put mom in that coma . Pete , this is our dad we 're talking about here . Believe me , dads aren 't always what they seem . - Where is he ? - Stay away from him . He 's dangerous , Nathan . Look what he did to me . If our father 's alive , I need to know where he is . What 's the name of the company ? Pinehearst . Pinehearst , the bio-tech firm ? No , I 'm not going to let you do this . Nathan ... Trust me . - Please . - Okay . We 'll do it your way . There 's a lot of ways to shut Pinehearst down . I 'll go call somebody up from the justice department . We 'll get some help . You 're not going to listen to a word he just said , are you ? Nope , I 'm going to see my father . How do you know about Pinehearst ? I 've been taking a consultant fee from them for over a year . I 'm coming with you . I know the players there , I can open doors . I don 't need any doors opened . I plan on kicking them down . Is that food ? It 's a recipe . It 's been in my family for thousands of years . You refuse to go back in time . Even if it means saving the world . I cannot risk changing history . If only there is some other way of learning about my enemies . Uncovering their weak spots , so I can defeat them . For thousands of years , my family have taken spirit walks . Following destiny 's path into the realms of the unconsciousness . Delicious . Spirit walk sounds much safer than time traveling . Okay ... I 'm ready to begin my journey . How do I start ? You eat a disgusting paste ... made from the roots of a tamboti tree . And the dung of hyena . And then ? You wait . Hiro ! Hiro ! You tricked him . I warned him . If he did not choose his path , it would be chosen for him . Hiro . Hiro . He 's going to wake up , right ? He 's going to be okay ? Hiro ... Hiro , Hiro ! Hiro !

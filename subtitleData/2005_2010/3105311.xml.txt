 ( HI TED ) ( no intenet connectiong available ) ( ted i know u 're there ) ( i am not on line , how are u doing this ) ( I know what they did to u ) ( Look at the needle ) ( we should meet ) ( turn around ) My name is Hana Gitelman . How the hell did you do that ? Satellite signals . Wi-Fi , radio waves . Your computer can download them and so can I. So you can , uh , access the internet without a computer . Just pull email out of your head . ( yes ) And you 're radioactive . Why come to me ? Because they got to me too . I can find them , Ted . And you can nuke them . previously on heroes Turned on the waterworks , and they were mine . They 're getting the suitcase as we speak . Where 's the bag ? You may fool Ando , but you do not fool me . Matt Parkman , here to protect you , sir . ( Matt ) Sir , we 've got to get out of here right now . This is a setup . What ? How do you know that ? I just do . Now , you absorb all these abilities you find . I 'm gonna teach you how to pull ' em out one at a time . I don 't have to do anything ! Except fly . ( Suresh ) Hello . Zane Taylor ? Yes . You must be Dr. Suresh . Come on in . There are others out there like you . And I am going to find them . I could go with you . She had an appointment with a neurologist . Your mother 's been having some headaches . Yeah , she 's also been having some memory loss . Did you tell them that ? I don 't know any Mr. Muggles . And I don 't know you . Dad ? Dad ? Dad ! Where 's Dad ? He 's on one of his stupid business trips . There 's something wrong with Mom . There 's something wrong with you . Mom ? Do you know who this is ? Claire , leave your brother alone . You recognize us ? Yes , you are the daughter who is supposed to be setting the dinner table . I was standing right there just a minute ago , and you had no idea who I was . Lyle , help your sister with the table . Honestly , Claire . Good thing Dad 's not home , 'cause he would so drug test you . It 's good you called us , Isaac . I didn 't know who else to trust . That man , Peter Petrelli , ? I tried finding him . I kept painting what I thought were empty spaces . And now ? There , in the water . Footprints . So ... Peter 's invisible ? That sound so crazy ? Any more than a man who can paint the future ? Peter absorbs others ' abilities . Apparently , he 's met someone who we assumed was dead . That 's the roof of the- - The Deveaux building . Look , there 's a chance that Peter might come here first before we reach him . What do you expect me to do with this ? ? Capture : FRM @ MAOREN Sync : FRM @ ºãÐÇ ¾ ÆÄÒ · ¹ ´ üle Petit Prince HEROES 116 Hey . Hey . You know what ? Let me do that . I am pregnant , not porcelain . No , I 'm just trying to be Mr. Helpful . Try Mr. Get-the-hell out-of-the-way . What did you do ? You like it ? I love it . I do . Yeah ? Matt , we can 't afford this . I mean , we 're- - Nah , come on . I got a guy . He gave it to me wholesale , so ... I 'm so bloated . You , you look so beautiful to me . I 'm sorry . You- - made this beautiful gesture , and I have to mess it up . What do you mean ? A man called yesterday . HEA Professor Suresh . He was a geneticist . He wanted to talk about DNA . Matt , your DNA . Did you te I mean , you didn 't tell him anything , did you ? Of course I didn 't tell him anything . He found you . He knows . Geneticists . Who are these people ? ? I just wanted to say thanks . For what ? Well , you know , for bringing me with you . You didn 't have to do that . It would have been a long road alone . I 'm glad for the company . Well , I believe in fate , Mohinder , and karma , and I 'm not just saying that 'cause you 're Indian . I mean , you really came to my rescue , and I won 't forget that . It 's not completely altruistic on my part , Zane . I have a feeling we 're gonna meet up with a lot of skepticism from these people . You can help . I 'm ready . ( Suresh ) Excuse me ! Excuse me . Oh . Rap music . Can 't stand it , but it 's the only thing I 've found that cancels out the- - Can I help you ? We 're looking for Dale Smither . You found her . Oh . O-of course . I 'm Mohinder Suresh , and this is Mr. Taylor . Zane . Actually , it 's just Zane . I left you several messages this week . Yeah , I got ' em . I believe I can help with what 's happening to you . I 'm sure you have lots of questions . Yeah , only one- - how 'd you find me ? You gave blood 11 years ago . RO Signed a consent form to have a sample used in a program called the Human Genome Project . You dialed the wrong number . Look , I know what you 're thinking right now , that you 've got nobody to talk to , nobody that understands what you 're going through . But that 's not true . I-I understand . Yeah ? Damn . That was my best wrench . So there really are others , huh ? Yes . p ú | I 'm proof of that . That 's why we 're here . I-I- - I thought the headaches at first were gonna kill me . I 'd lie awake at night thinking that my head was gonna explode . A cockroach crawling across my neighbor 's floor was like a marching band parading through my house . I 'm sorry . It must be quite a burden . A burden ? Hell , no . This is the best damn thing that ever happened to me . Well , now that I 've learned to control it , I 'm like Superman or something . I can hear rain coming from 40 miles away . I can even hear someone 's moods- - the tiniest changes in a heartbeat . Yours , for instance . It 's racing kind of fast . You nervous about something ? Um , no , I 'm just excited to meet somebody like me . Well , if you 've come to try to take it away from me , you 're gonna have a hell of a fight on your hands . I can assure you we only want to help . Uh , I 'd like to perform a few tests , ES s-some questions , really , that 's all . Shouldn 't take more than a couple of hours . I 'm kinda backed up today . We can come back in the morning . Okay . ONE TWO THREE ANDO ? Is that u ? i 'm locked in ! You 're not Ando . S.R. Gustavson . State Gaming Commission . I come in peace . ? Ando is my friend . I bring him from Japan on my mission . Where 's the girl ? Oh ! Where 's the suitcase ? She said her name Hope . Tell me where they are ! Take me with you . I must save Ando . Not a chance . I work alone , pal . You take me with you or she gets away ... pal . I so miss you , Karen . I miss your laugh . But they 're gonna pay for what they did to me . What they did to us . I know you 're not gonna like what I gotta do . So , uh , I came to say good-bye . Enough ! I say when it 's enough ! You 've got a power to stop me . What are you waiting for ? I 'm trying ! And when you 've left New York a smoking wasteland , we 'll put that on your tombstone : " Here lies Peter Petrelli . He tried . " Dig into that file cabinet of yours and pull something out ! He Fly , stop time , paint me a pretty picture . Do ... something ... unexpected ! Ha ha ! You pushed that away with your mind . Which one of your sorry friends has telekinesis ? None of ' em do . Right--that guy who was chasing Claire in Texas . He sent some lockers flying at me . Texas ? And you pulled that little trick out in the here and now ? Well , we might just have a chance at stopping you from going nuclear . ( Isaac ) I tried . Every street I painted , every building--empty . I think Peter 's left New York . [ chuckles ] Why does this seem so familiar ? He Oh , now I remember . You 'd get that same look on your face when you 'd lie to me about using . You think I 'm lying ? You 're right . I can 't willingly throw you into another man 's arms . Because you 're jealous . Because he 's dangerous . Oh , God . I don 't think I should have this anymore . Keep it . Please . I would do anything for you , Simone . Anything . Find Peter . ES Look , you 're nothing but a Japanese MapQuest for me . So till we find that girl , just sit there and shut up . I bring Ando from Japan on my mission . I am responsible for him . All a partner ever does is either drag you under or screw you over . A partner helps by believing in you . He keeps you honest . Uh-huh . Well . Who wanted to help the girl ? Grab the suitcase ? take your car Ando . You take on a partner , all you get is their blood on your hands . Why are we stopping here ? I thought we were going to your mother 's house . The less questions you ask , Ando , the better off you 'll be in life . Why is that ? That 'd be another question . Here , I will help you with- - No , I 've got it . It 's okay- - No- - What is this ? What did I say about asking questions ? You know , I have to admit , Zane , when you first offered to help , I was- - I was cautious . In what way ? I don 't know you . You don 't know me . It could have been a disaster . You ... made a difference today . Thank you . Here is your key . When you told that woman Dale that you could help her , is that really possible ? It 's only theoretical at this point . But I am working on an inhibitor , a chemical that 'll isolate the genetic mutation that causes these abnormalities . We can offer these people understanding , control , or , if needed , elimination of their ability . Elimination ? You make it sound like a virus or plague . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to imply- - It 's just not all of you exhibit the same sets of skills you do . And they can be dangerous . My father had to learn that firsthand . How 's that ? He was murdered by a man named Sylar . Well , what happened to this ... Sylar ? I 'm not sure . He just got away with killing your dad ? I only know he 's gone , locked away . What does it matter ? Even if I could come face-to-face with him , what difference would it make ? Justice can never really be served . What a shame . They 're out there . HE I can feel them ... so innocent , so unaware of what 's happening to them . We 'll find them , Mohinder . All of them , together . The two of us . It 's our destiny . I 'm gonna call it a night . yeah I 'll catch you in the morning . He [ door opens , closes ] Claire , do we need to talk ? No . Yes . ES Mom , you know how you sometimes forget things ? Honey , is this about my trip to the neurologist ? It 's just some headaches . I don 't want you to worry . But they don 't know what 's causing it , right ? We are still waiting on the results from the tests . What if it 's not some thing that 's responsible for it but someone ? What on earth are you talking about ? What if you knew a secret , and they had a way to brainwash you ? [ laughs ] You have been studying long enough . Let 's curl up in my bed , piece of pie , glass of milk , and watch an old Cary Grant movie . Mom , I 'm serious . I know this is a little scary , but Dad 's in charge of talking to the doctors , and they will come up with the answers . Maybe you shouldn 't trust Dad so much . Now , why would you say that ? What if it gets worse ... and next time that you- - Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom , please wake up . What 's this all about anyways ? What 's what ? The birds . I mean , you- - you sort of hate everything , everyone . Except you treat these pigeons like they 're family . Charles Darwin bred pigeons when he was working out his theory of evolution . Married up various permutations to get maximum potential . What do you mean by that , maximum potential ? I think he meant you , friend . But you used to care . About all this . Didn 't you ? All right , sharing time 's over . Time to get- - What are you doing ? ? Claire , this isn 't a great time . Dad , you have to come home . Mom fell and she blacked out . I called 911- - What happened to her ? I came home and she didn 't even know who I was . She didn 't even remember Mr. Muggles . I 'm coming home right away . Claude 'll have to wait . ( Janice ) Matt , where are you ? Hey , what 's up ? The ring . I took it to get resized , and the jeweler told me it was worth $ 40,000 . Well , that 's ridiculous . And he accused me of stealing it . I had to tell him my husband was a cop anthere has to be some kind of an explanation . There is an explanation , right ? He The guy that I was protecting , Malsky ... those were his . You were gonna get upset- - You let me keep the ring . It was stolen property . What were you thinking ? I don 't know what I was thinking . I have no idea . You know , Matt , for a guy that can ... read other people 's thoughts , you should spend a little bit of time on your own . You know what ? I 'm just trying to figure out how to take care of our family . I don 't have a job , Jan. And I 'm worried that the baby- - Ever since you told me about this thing , this thing that you do , I have tried to act like everything 's okay , but it 's not . It 's stealing and lying . Matt , you 're better than this ! All right . Fine , I 'll take them down to the precinct . ? What ? Call them right now . Hello ? What ? Where are you right now ? Yeah . Yeah , I know the place . I 'll be right there . Who was that ? I , uh , I gotta go out . Where ? Matt . How you feeling ? You knew they were after you . Who ? I don 't know who they were ! You wanted to know why I was invisible all these years . It was because of them , and you 've brought the bastards right to my door ! I just saved your ass ! You 've no idea what you 've done . Your mate , the painter . He took your girl up to the roof . He must have known we were up there . Isaac . He 's a comic book artist . Let 's call a spade a shovel , mate . It had to be Isaac . They got to him . You said yourself he disappeared for a bit , right ? Yeah , so ? Well , that 's how it works . At least , that 's how it did in my day . You drop off the face of the earth for a few days , wake up with a memory hole , a killer headache , and a souvenir . Did he have a set of these ? I don 't know . What is that ? Those are for the lucky ones . So what do we do now- - hey ! We ? You watch your own back . I do what I always do- - disappear . I 'm not letting you run again . We 're getting somewhere with all this . You should have thought of that before you brought your baggage to my roof . I can 't do this on my own . Then I guess you go boom . Have you heard from Peter ? He Last time I saw my brother , he flew out of a window to get away from me . I doubt he 's going to come knocking on my door . He flew out a window ? So to speak . Simone , I 've got people looking for him , people I can trust . Around the clock . We 'll find him . But what if you don 't ? You need to go public , call a press conference , tell everyone about Peter 's condition . Nobody 's gonna believe somebody can explode and destroy a city , Simone . I can 't believe I believe it . Let 's tell them everything . Isaac painting the future , Hiro stopping time . Even you--what you all can do is incredible . It 's time people know what 's happening . The truth . Simone , look , I know your heart- - it 's in the right place . You want to help Peter , and I want to help him too . But if people knew what we were capable of , they would drop a collective brick . You think they 'll burn you at the stake ? Yeah , pretty much . Because that 's what I would do . I 'd round us all up , stick us in a lab on some island in the middle of the ocean . Where Peter saw hope , you see disaster . Huh . I guess I 'm voting for the other guy . Simone . Do not take this public . But you kissed me . I thought you liked me . Don 't remind me . What will happen to me now ? Damn it ! Hope ! I want my share . Ando ! Hiro ! Ando ! Ando ! This way hurry ! Gustavson , you can 't spend it if you 're dead ! Neither can you ! Hiro I 'm sorry I should 've listened to u No.this is all my fault . I never should have ... . brought u on my mission And if you didn 't ... i would be at my desk in tokyo I would never know . what it is to be a hero I don 't want to die . Did your powers work ? I had my eyes closed ! Me too Her GUN must have misfired I guess ... Lucky for us ! Look Ando ! Not a scratch on the Versa ! Funny . I didn 't hear your footsteps . That 's because there weren 't any . That sound . In your heart . What is it ? Murder . Is my mom gonna be okay ? She 's stable . When your dad gets here , we can discuss options . Options ? Claire , why don 't you come sit down . Your mother has a subdural hemorrhage . I got a C-minus in biology . Oh . It 's , um ... it 's like a bruise on her brain . Specifically the area that controls memory . Has your mother had any recent exposure to radiation ? A history of epilepsy ? Claire , if this is a result of domestic violence- - No . No , it 's not like that . Not really . Then what 's it like ? You won 't believe me . Anything you say will be held in the strictest confidence . There 's a man ... who works for my dad . He can make you forget things . Anything , just by touching you with his hands . I 'll talk to your father . Wa , I 'm telling you the truth ! Hey , I only came here because you said it was a matter of life and death . You can 't go blowing anything else up . I found out what these are . They 're tracking us . Like animals ! What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? The truth . Hey ! What 's going on ? Ted ? She 's--she 's a friend , okay , like us . She 's the one who put me onto the scratches . It comes from a pneumatic needle . It injects a radioisotope for tracking viruses in Africa . That 's what we are to them , a-a virus . A plague . Who 's them ? A shipment of needles went to Primatech Paper in Odessa , Texas . The tracking slip went to a man named Bennet . Sound familiar ? I 've already been down this road . Trust me , it 's a dead end . Really ? Yeah . Why would a paper company need pneumatic needles with a radioisotope ? I had my blood tested . It 's in me , that isotope . Ted , you 're radioactive by nature . How much you wanna bet it 's in you too ? No , it 's insane . No ! I want to put this whole thing behind me . My wife and I have a baby coming , my family needs me . If you got a family , that means you got something to protect . There is no putting this whole thing behind you . ? If they can track us like you say they can , he 'll know we 're coming . Good . I can get us through any wall they got . I need you to get inside his head . He can 't lie to us if you 're there . We 'll find out the truth . Look , I cannot do this ... without you . If we can save ourselves , we could help others . We could be heroes ! Dad . I 've convinced the doctor to let us take her home in the morning . She 'll be okay . No thanks to you . Shut up , Claire . Claire , can I talk to you outside ? Please ? The doctor told me you had an interesting theory about your mom 's condition . It 's not a theory . You did this to her . You erased her mind . Claire , that 's ridiculous . You tried to erase mine . I don 't know where you 're getting these ideas . Stop . Stop it ! Stop lying ! After what you did to Mom , isn 't that enough ? What you know is dangerous . If the wrong people find out about what you can do- - Like the man who killed Jackie ? Exactly . Why ? Why did you do this to Mom ? A few days ago , that man broke into our house ... looking for you . He found your mother instead . So I made her forget . ? And people like her shouldn 't have to know about people like him . And maybe people like you . I never meant for her to get sick . I only wanted to protect my family . Claire bear , I promise- - I promise this will never happen again . No ! You don 't just get to say you 're sorry and make everything go away . Ow . Zane , are you all right ? Yeah , it 's just , uh , it 's just a headache . Okay . Sit tight . I 'll be back . Ow ! Hello ? Anybody here ? Hey , maybe we should just come back , Mohinder . Dale ? Mohinder , what 's the matter ? What are you doing ? Dialing 911 . Do you think that 's a good idea ? What are you talking about ? She was murdered . And what were we doing here ? What do you mean ? We found her . How ? Why ? I mean , l-look at us . Where did we come from ? How did we get here ? Can we explain any of this without looking completely insane ? The top of her head was removed . It was Sylar . I don 't--I mean , how ? Sylar . Okay , we have to warn them . Everyo on the list . He 's after them . We 'll , uh , we 'll leave now and we 'll call the police anonymously from the road . Zane , are you okay ? Oh , Hiro . My arm still hurts a little . U should drive . No u always drive . Take the Veasa back to the rental car place . What are u doing ? What i should , ve done weeks ago . Go home ando . Why are u doing this ? I said i was sorry about the girl . This isn 't about u . It 's about me . I made a mistake by bringing u along . I have to do this alone . But u can 't ! It 's Destiny ! The comic book ... we are going to save the world ! Life isn 't a comic book . Too many people have died since we began . I don 't know what i should do ... if I lost u too . Hiro please ! Hiro ! Hey , young fella . All by yourself ? Lyle . Claire . We 'll get through this . Your mom needs us . Lyle too . I don 't even know if I 'll remember any of this tomorrow . All I want to do is run away , but I can 't . Somebody has to protect this family from you . Lyle , take your mother . Get out of the house right now . Dad ? I 'm sure you have a lot of questions . We all do . Why 'd you do it , Isaac ? How 'd you get in here ? What 'd they give you , money ? Drugs ? What 's a Judas get these days ? I was trying to stop you . You 're dangerous . You said it yourself . Without them to help , you 'll become that . I had help . I was learning to control it . You scared my only chance of hope ! Stop it ! What are these marks , huh ? What do they mean ? They 're nothing . They mean nothing . Don 't lie to me ! This is why you sent them after me . Jealousy ? With me out of the way , you 'd have Simone all to yourself . You stole her away from me ! But I did it to save New York , to stop the bomb . I can do it right now . With just one bullet , I can be a hero . ? You 're a junkie . You couldn 't even save yourself . That 's why she left you , Isaac . It had nothing ... to do ... with me ! Show yourself ! No . Simone ! No .

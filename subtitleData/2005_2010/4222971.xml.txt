 In the far distant future , when all cars are giving up wheels for the air-cars , there existed the fools who carried on racing with the vanishing spirit ... The leading pack has entered the long long pass . In the meantime , relay units have begun moving on to here at the water stop . Even after two interplanetary wars , REDLINE 's still ever popular amongst the public . Instead of currently mainstream antigravity engine ... Papa ! My money 's on Sonoshee . You really like her , huh ? I put mine on Deguon . You 're kidding ! I can 't . You stink ! You can squeeze in ! 2358 teams made the entry . Preceding Blue Line has — Who did you bet on ? JP . No way ! Pa ! Where were you ? With 6 teams already having made it , a battle for the last spot is raging here at Yellow Line . Papa ! This way ! Hurry ! Venue for the REDLINE is still under wraps . Curious to see the result of viewers ' request . Once the winner of Yellow Line is settled , REDLINE 's venue will be announced . Get around to the right . Roger . Our own relay unit Portal has just arrived at the final relay point . Papa ! A Portal is here ! It 's a Portal ! Look ! Now , let 's get back to the race and see who 's coming first . Pa ! Get the camera , quick ! It 's upside down , Papa ! Papa ! The lens cap 's on ! Did you see that ? ! So cool ! Only 50 clicks left in the Planet Dorothy Yellow Line . Against everyone 's expectation , " Cherry Boy Hunter " Sonoshee McLaren 's hover jet is still in the lead , She 's heading straight toward the goal in Crab Sonoshee . Very first REDLINE champion : Captain-2-Block 's Captain the Classic in second . Followed by the REDLINE regular , Count Markdie and Spark in their Snake Head . Coming up fourth ls Lynchman 's archenemy , Psychoman Lotten 's Psycho Rod . With these four leading the race , the second group is coming up fourteen seconds behind them . From planet Supergrass ruled by the Princess with magical powers Deguon 's Fire Bird is leading the group . Right behind her is Planet Dorothy 's own Bons Missile-EP4 . Sweet JP 's Transam is seventh at the very end . The other racers are left way behind . Looks like it 's down to these seven . Though I have my doubts about JP at this stage . Doubts , you say ? Just trying to make things interesting here . What do you announcers know about racing ? ! JP 's uncorked the nitro on the final stretch ! He 's making a break for it ! He broke away from the second group on a rocket ride ! Crab Sonoshee ls still keeping the leading position . Look out ! JP 's Transam has caught its tail ! Take this ! Look at JP 's splendid move ! The heat is on ! The crowd must be going wild . Captain the Classic moving up on Crab Sonoshee . That punk ! He held back till the last quarter like you said . He 's the odds on favorite near the finish . Everything 's hunky-dory , huh , Frisbee ? JP 's the only one who can pull off a fixed game like this . None of these guys can beat him at the Yellow Line . That 's what you say . You don 't think JP would try to win this , do you ? Not a chance . But if he wins , he qualifies for REDLINE . You don 't think he may just decide to go for it ? That won 't happen . I can guarantee that . You 're becoming a nuisance , Cherry Boy Hunter ! Crab Sonoshee 's hover jet takes a chance by diving into the river . You 're not getting away ! I 'll send you all to hell ! Here we go ! You know , Frisbee , if JP wins , the syndicate 's gonna take a big hit . Look . He isn 't called " Sweet JP " for nothing . Besides , he wouldn 't risk going back in the joint . " Sweet JP " , huh ? I hope you 're right . Bids are locked . And our position on JP ? All unloaded . Good . Now we 'll see how your friendship with JP plays out . Hold it , hold it ... Now ! Overtaking Crab Sonoshee , JP finally takes the lead ! Nobody can catch him now . He 's charging toward the finish line on the nitro drive . Yes ! You amateurs are shitty racers ! You guys suck ! Let 's go . Thank you ! Sonoshee McLaren won the Planet Dorothy Yellow Line . A new queen of racing is born ! The ticket to REDLINE is hers . Listen to the crowd ! This completes the lineup of racers for REDLINE . The venue for the big race will be announced shortly . Look . What ? You first . No , you go . After you . After you . That Transam must cost a fortune . You couldn 't possibly put together a machine like that . You knew exactly what you were getting into . You 're off the hook with your bondsman now . That should cover your hospital bill and more . I 'd say it 's a win-win . Racers and mechanics gotta stick together . You and I make a good team . Always have . Call me when you wanna get in the game again . We can make tons of money as a team , you know . Hey , watch out ! You crazy ? I changed my mind . It 's all yours . What 's this ? An attack of principles ? Your bondsman won 't like it . So I go back in . Probably better off . What the heck is that ? Wait , wait ! JP ! How do you feel about going to REDLINE ? Sweet JP ! How about a big smile for our camera ? Don 't get me into it ! Are you really going for the race ? Will you drop out ? What are you talking about ? I just blew the Yellow Line . What , you didn 't know ? Huh ? To replace already declined KURUKURU = DAZA and SHOTO = O-JIN , the team Miki Todoroki - the winner of the Blue Line and JP , who showed a brilliant run at the Yellow Line got nominated . The hell ? ! They just announced the next REDLINE 's venue . It 'll be at Roboworld ! Roboworld ? ! You shitting me ? ! My beloved people of M3 nebula ! I shall fight REDLINE that dares to enter our sector . Shame on those criminals for disturbing our galaxy 's order ! Roboworld is a symbol of humanity that exists for peace . I can never allow REDLINE to enter this sacred place ! We will destroy any outsiders who enter our territory by any means necessary ! See ? No chance . The next REDLINE 's gonna be held at Roboworld ... Confirmed just a few minutes ago . Can 't believe they 're allowing this . That 's just it . They 're not . Thought so . That 's why KURUKURU = DAZA and SHOTO = O-JIN dropped out . I was gonna be in it for fun , you know ? There 's no way I 'm gonna race while dodging the bullets . That 's true . I 'm a racer now , not a soldier . I 've had enough of that shit . Not me . Roboworld is an important client of my kingdom . I 'm not ready to give up my life just yet . So after the popularity poll , the top two teams were picked . I see ... Are you going ... or will you drop out ? JP , please make a statement ! I take it back , Frisbee . Fix the Transam , will you ? What ? ! So you 're going , then ? He won 't . Is that official , JP ? Think twice before you say something . Give me the camera . Please give us a comment , JP ! Watch out , Roboworld ! Here comes JP ! That 's the comment from JP , who qualified for REDLINE . Oh goody ! It 's time for the festival of fools again ! I like rough sports every now and then . Parole Europass The ship is approaching Roboworld 's satellite , Europass . Please prepare for landing in the designated pod . The ship is approaching Roboworld 's satellite , Europass . Please prepare for landing in the designated pod . Wow ! It 's picking up speed . Where 's the switch for the flaps ? Is this a coffin or what ? ! This is nothing but a serious act of aggression ! Secretary Titan ! Sir ! You must have something to report ! I just received a message from our scout vessels . They identified a group of ships on Europass 's surface . Europass ? Yes . Oh , the planet we donated to those pathetic refugees . It 's demilitarized under our treaty with M3 Nebula Federation . That means our forces must tread very carefully there . Besides , the refugees from nearby sectors have drifted in and set up slums all over the place . It 's an ideal hideout for REDLINE racers . This is what we get for being so generous ! They have the audacity to claim it being the viewers ' request . Don 't they know we can 't put our military secrets at risk ? No way we 'd allow a stupid race in such a sacred place ! Mr. President . You okay , sir ? Mr. President ! What ? You 're not going to stand by and let them pass , are you ? I am the rule ! All those affiliated are guilty and deserve to be hanged ! As the president , I 'll take full responsibility because I represent justice . The entire universe is in need of a strong leadership , and Roboworld always does right with great heroism ! Colonel Volton ! Are you ready to shed your blood for justice ? More than ready , sir ! Good ! Fight with your life for the ultimate justice ! Thank you , sir ! Hey , you ! Hey , I 'm talking to you ! Don 't you ignore me ! Buy the ticket , will ya ? Don 't ignore me ! You have money , don 't you ? How about I give you a discount ? What happened there ? Get off me . What happened ? Stop it ! Sorry to disappoint , but I 'm not here to watch . Useless ! You 're so totally useless to us ! Ah , fuck . Wait ! One , two , three , four ... Next ! ls this it ? You 're sure about the exchange rate ? Just about right . Next ! Just about ? What the heck is that ? You need to take money more seriously ... You 're annoying ! Right here . What ? Need some smokes . Got money ? Sure . I just cashed in . Give me as many as this will get . Here . Huh ? Is this it ? It 's already open . This ain 't right . Money needs to be taken — Don 't like it ? Then leave it ! Just leave it and walk away ! Huh ? Woops . Dude ! View is clear ! Good . Let 's roll ! Nice ! Antigravity engine 's not bad . Yeah ... not bad at all ! Done . Oh , it 's you . This planet is really something , huh ? What did you expect ? This place gets flotsam from all over the galaxy . It 's hard for the idea of service to sink in . How are you holding up ? Fine , I guess ... Ouch ! Yeah , I can see that . I got the case from Frisbee . Stuffed with cash . It 's for the Transam . He used to drop everything to work on your machine . He sure has changed . Like you , me and everything else . Cigs cost more and good junk joints are harder to find . So where 's my wheels ? You really did it this time , ingrate . What were you thinking using the nitro twice ? You have a death wish ? I need three caps for the REDLINE . Three ! Hey , watch it ! I 'm going up against a bunch of hard cases . I 'm gonna need an edge , aren 't I ? You want an edge ? Then get your machine armed up . You know that anything goes at REDLINE . I can get you armed up good . This is a race , not a war . I don 't want any of this crap on my machine . That 's right , I forgot . You are " Sweet JP . " Don 't call me that ! The red rules are you can do whatever the hell you want . Spirit of fair play will only leave you out of sync . Out of sync , huh ? 30 years in this business and I still got my chops . I clean up good with all the trades I get at the race . A little fun on the side wouldn 't hurt , either . Listen , JP . If you want a stove that 'll stand up to three caps of juice , you 're talking a redesign from scratch . If you don 't want the crap , all I can do is to get you a new engine and parts . I wish I could do more . Hey , you listening to me ? Frisbee can handle the redesigning and tune-up . You 're joking ! Why ? When was the last time you two worked as a team ? Stop it . Frisbee 's not legit anymore . I said stop it ! He 's sold out . He 's no good ! Talking about the fix ? He 's not the same man . You know that , right ? Helping an ingrate like you is no big deal , but getting mixed up with that scum is another story . Racers and mechanics gotta stick together . You and I make a good team . Always have . Hey , Frisbee . I was wondering when you 'd show . I may be a scum , but I still got the touch , you know . Don 't judge a man 's skill by his character . So you also learned to sneak around now , Frisbee ? Relax , old man . If I didn 't have the touch . I wouldn 't still be here . Nobody 's worried about your touch . Old man 's on board . I didn 't agree on anything . Hey , quit that ! I guess I 'll leave it to the two of you now . Hey ! Where are you going ? Old man will get a new engine . Frisbee takes care of redesign and mods . I 'll do my job when I put my butt behind the wheel . Until then , I 'll leave everything to you pros . Like the old days . He think he 's cool or something ? What do you want ? This ain 't your seat , punk ! You want some ? ! Oh , a comb ... Don 't make me jump , you fool ! I see you 're having a full house today , waiter . I 'm the manager , you jerk ! And enough with wisecracks ! The place 's deserted . Just pick a table and settle down , will ya ? Sure , whatever . Sorry about that , lady . He won 't bother you anymore , so don 't worry . Here 's your soup spaghetti a la Europass lobster . Wow , it looks great ! Enjoy your meal . Thank you . Watch what you 're wearing ! Oh no ! How embarrassing ! What are you doing ? Nothing . No , seriously . Excuse me . I 'm JP . JP ? Are you gonna eat that ? Huh ? What 's this ? Give me a break ... Mind if I join you ? I 'm waiting for someone . Bummer . You 're that guy from the Yellow Line . I remember now ! You 're going to REDLINE as a substitute , right ? What do you want ? I thought I 'd check you out since you 're going , too . Come again ? She saw my underpants ... Winning the Yellow Line with a hover engine ... It 's so cool so I wanted to see what 's the deal . And the verdict ? Verdict ? Well ... I see an engine geek with no interest in men . You guessed right ! Wheels are my only love . I know nothing but racing since a kid . So you are one of those sad lot without human friends . Why don 't you just go now ? My Dad was a racer . We owned a junk joint . We used to build our own machines to enter races . I see . It was the most natural thing to do ... What 's that ? Steamlight . Isn 't it pretty ? My Dad gave it to me on my seventh birthday . So this is a steamlight , huh ? I 've never seen one before . They say when burned as fuel , it releases 100 times more energy than gold nitro . No kidding . I saw the real steamlight for the first time , too . Energy source with unlimited capacity ... No man can handle that amount of power , though . You know a lot , don 't you ? Oh , pardon me . I 'm Shinkai . Pleased to meet you . Aren 't you gonna eat that hexagonal worm spaghetti ? It 's very good . Please have some . Oh goody ! May I perhaps taste some of you as well tonight ? Yummy time ! She would have been mine if you haven 't interrupted . Mr. Substitute . A reserve , would do . You guys are racers , right ? I saw you on the news . I 'm a racer myself , you know . Though I must say I 'm more known as a mechanic . I have a partner named Trava . Trava ? Let me go ! Stop trashing the place ! Take it outside ! Trava ! Your partner ? The one who 's beaten up , yes . Which one 's beaten ? What the hell did you do that for ? You started it . Shit ! Here he goes ! It 's your fault , damn it . You betrayed the army . Is the tough guy crying ? That 's Little Deyzuna . He used to be in the army with us . He becomes impossibly strong when he cries . Having a race in Roboworld ! You 're just doing that to make me suffer ! That 's bullshit ! It 's nothing personal and you know it ! Liar ! Here comes another trouble . Well , if it ain 't Machine Head Tetsuzin himself . For real ? Yep . He 's Mr. REDLINE . The fastest man in the galaxy . Outta my way . What did you say ? I said , outta my way ! You think you can order me around ? I 'm just telling you to move . That 's an order , you moron ! Fine . I 'll just go around you then . That 's what you get when you mess with me ! The hell with the race ! Sonoshee ! This way ! What ? Roboworld forces . You 're a hard man to find . Co-Colonel Volton ! No one gave you an order to leave the base ! I told you to stay put , didn 't I ? Look what you did ! Too bad you had to come all the way here to save his sorry ass . Stay there ! This is a demilitarized zone . We won 't stand for this . So what ? Huh ? I said , so what ? Are you hard of hearing or something ? Oh I can hear you fine . I just don 't need your permission . Doesn 't matter . I got what I came for . I have my orders to use force on the day of the race . Jesus ... The meanest troops in the galaxy ! Mr. President generously offered his presence at your silly race . You should try to be good targets in return . I suppose having your heads can wait . Hey , you ! Don 't try something stupid . You 're blocking the ventilation . Beat it . You 've got seven guns pointed at you . That 'll solve my ... Ouch . Aw ! That hurts ... How 's your head ? I 'll live . What were you thinking ? Those bastards were really trying my patience . Couldn 't help it . You got your plan all screwed up by them , too . I guess you 're right . Thanks for this . You really are sweet , aren 't you ? It 's a stupid nickname for the fans , " Cherry Boy Hunter " Sonoshee McLaren . Cherry Boy ? What 's that ? Haven 't you read the paper ? That nickname of yours made quite a headline . That 's stupid ! Don 't look at me . What did you do that for ? Why the sour face ? Cherry Boy Hunter ... Can I ask you something ? What ? Why do you do it ? Why do you ? Me ? Not much to tell . Then don 't ask me . Sorry . C 'mon ! Out with it ! I mean ... It 's really no big deal . Really . I see . Suit yourself . You need more muscles if you wanna take those bastards . Good night now . G 'night . Hey , you dropped this ! Oh , well . Go faster ! Go ! All right ! Go for it ! That was a close one ! Is she okay ? You did great ! You drive like the wind ! You gave all you have . Just forget about it . I 'm gonna race in the REDLINE someday ! What ? I busted my ass for it everyday . I can 't afford to waste my time like this ! I 'm not like you amateurs who 're all talk and no action . Why don 't you quit watching and get over here with the rest of us ? Wow ... I bet she doesn 't remember . JP ! I 'm telling you , I can 't work with this jerk . Why ? Your pal here says he doesn 't like the engine I got . You sure about him ? It 's REDLINE ! We need something bigger . A lot bigger . We 're talking about the race here ! A man is driving ! This guy 's talking about goddamn TRZ airmaster ! Awesome ! Go ahead , laugh ! It 's a crap ! Sure it 's got power but unstable as hell . Four cycle TRZ airmaster ! All it needs is a dose of Frisbee magic . Hell it is ! Besides , JP 's driving it . You think he hasn 't got what it takes ? You are the only one I have trouble trusting . Who do you think you are ? Showing up with all that money , then you start to boss me around ! Just get him what he wants . Not you too ! Get him what he needs . You 're getting yourself killed . As far as the design goes , Frisbee 's in charge . We 're a team , right ? Ha ! It 's all in the past . You know how long it 'll take to get one of those monsters ? It 's your job to get what we need in time for the race . You 're in charge of getting us the engine . Some things just can 't be done . Old man ... please . Let me race in his machine . Fine , you fool ... It 's gonna cost you double though . Thanks , old man . I owe you one . Two days away What speed . Not as many as I expected . The ones with money don 't come here . They like keeping it quiet at private tracks . I get it . This is the place for the struggling racers . Don 't worry . Looks like the engine will make it in time . He 'll get it . He always comes through . That 's our old man . I talked to Inuki by the way . Same drill as the last time . Stay in the last till the third quarter to get your odds down . Then make your move in the last quarter . Frisbee . Once I 'm behind the wheel , I 'm the boss , right ? I 'd rather find another way to pay for the engine . You may get a spare engine , but not a spare life . You really have no choice . We 're all in this together . That includes falling hot sparks and chip crumbs . An underground mine That 's it for today ! Let 's go place our REDLINE bets . Yeah ! An underground casino Buy No.4. It 's gonna win . It 's the current favorite . Give me 100 on No.4. How about you ? I 'll take 150 on Gori Rider . You sure ? He always comes in fifth . It won 't hurt . 50 on No.2 please . Don 't be stingy . Be bold ! 50 's good . I 'll take 300 on JP . You 're betting on a long shot , huh ? The odds 'll be 25,000 to 1 . I know . What the hell ? What 's this ? ! Break up this gathering immediately ! Shut up ! Give me money ! This is a violation of law . Next up is today 's segment featuring Crab Sonoshee . The new engine can dodge missiles by minimizing the heat source . On the thermograph chart , you can see it 's much smaller . Now the missiles ' heat sensor ... My butt 's on camera ! Looks like Crab Sonoshee 's gearing up for the big race . The man of sonic speed . Since his first win at the fourth REDLINE , this invincible king 's been at the top for 20 years . Machine integrated racer who keeps altering himself along with his machine " God Wing . " The irrefutable champion of REDLINE ! King of kings , Mr. REDLINE : Machine Head Tetsuzin ! Good evening all . I 'm Machine Head Tetsuzin . Well , for me ... how shall I put it ? I 'd say I 'm in a different league compared to the others . 'Cause in my case , I 'm a part of my machine . For the others , it 's " Me and my wheels . " But in my case , It 's " I am my wheels , " you see ? He can 't underestimate his rivals , though . The royal family 's Boiboi and Bosbos make their return , with Princess Supergrass , the last heir to magical superpowers . This time around , they 've sealed off their magic . Carefree beauty pair - Super Boins . Hi there ! I 'm a super sexy and gorgeous racer , Boiboi . I don 't know about that , but oh well ... I 'm Bosbos . We are Super Boins ! Wanna see my schtick ? I can make all kinds of faces . See ? How about it ? Impressive , huh ? I can make funny faces , too . So cute ! Now you 're creeping me out . So ? What do you say ? Dear Princess ! We are going to win for sure ! Planet Supergrass 's racing singing super idol . Here 's their new single , " ' Zooming Gears " ! And how can we forget this amazing pair ? Heel hero of Alsatia . The strongest , fastest bounty hunters ! The Mad Brothers - Lynchman and Johnny Boya ! We 're Lynchman and Johnny Boya , the bounty hunters . Don 't tell me you don 't know ! We 've never failed catching our targets ever , 'cause we 're fast . That bastard Machine Head has beaten us in the past , but with a new machine , it 's gonna be different . You 'll see . I 'll repay my debt from the last time in double . Don 't wet your pants , suckers ! Lynchman 's best fight No.7 is now on sale ! What the hell ? Eve Eve Looking good . A test car for the image training . I installed TRZ airmaster 's old engine . No kidding ! You should be able to get a feel with this . May I ? All yours . This is great ! This will do . That 's Sonoshee ! Hey , everyone ! After his dramatic crash landing in the Yellow Line , JP 's done it again during his latest test run . Crashed at 300 km per hour , he was miraculously uninjured . Showdown between the rivals . Day before the Yellow Line that Miki and Todoroki were qualified for a police vehicle relentlessly chased the speeding cars . And made a bull-charge at the Blue Line champs , who made it to REDLINE on reserve . Dirty policeman Hamesh Frini aka " Gori Rider " ! The tape shows you 've overdone it this time . I 'll bust them cocky racers who dare to challenge me by any means necessary . You got that ? ! Give me a comment , Gori Rider . A police officer known as moral example engaged in adultery ? Care to comment on your affair with Ms. Yang-Sue ? Shut up ! A vengeful wild pair from the shining blue planet , Miki and Todoroki ! Charismatic racer who turns any roads into a circuit , swears revenge in the REDLINE . Gori Rider ! Mother fuckers ! It 's finally here , JP ! Can 't get any better than this baby . 80 mm thick cylinder block can give you 35,000 horsepower . It 's the last airmaster . It 's not a dream . We finally got it ... Thought I couldn 't pull it off ? It 's a great engine with extraordinary power . It 's up to you now , Frisbee . I 'll have this in the Transam by morning . With a beefed up stove , it 's good for three loads . Relax , old man . I 'm putting my reputation at stake here . Must be a pre-race party going on at Roboworld . A goddess may see those . Where 're you going at this hour ? Gotta go . Where the hell is he going ? The big race is tomorrow . No idea . My job 's done here . An underground transmission station The walls are 800 mm thick cosmo titanium . Fire the shock-breaker ! Shit it in ! Damn Robopolice ! Trespassers detected . Come down from the walk immediately . You got no business here ! Get lost ! Hostile intent detected . Stop your resistance and surrender . Over my dead body ! Shoot the runner ! You bastard ! Stay the hell down ! What is it ? Coolie hires have attacked our main power station , so we switched to the auxiliary power source . Large-scale weapons are disabled till the power gets restored . Damn them ! Rest assured , Mr. President . We have a secret weapon for those who enter our atmosphere . A giant A.I. we 've been developing over the years . Solar system integrated satellite weapon unit ... The hyper-disintegrator cannon ! Please take a look . Hey , Lynchman . What ? Why did the Racing Commission put us up to this ? If the hyper-disintegrator was to blast all to hell , there won 't be any race . That means no betting . I see . Get in . That won 't be good for the fat cats . You know how much money is riding on this ? No idea . Enough to buy out a couple of planets . Wow ! Besides , it 's gonna be great publicity for them . REDLINE 's odds 'll go up , and so will their margins . I get it . So this is our target for today ? You got it ! The main power station 's system was attacked by the pro-REDLINE guerrillas consisted of coolie hires . As a result , the RED-RACERS are kept safe from ground to air strikes . Roboworld officials are currently working on corrective measures . According to government sources , a malfunction of the power station 's system has occurred late last night . When Robopolice has arrived — Your name ? JP ? Where did you get that ? Weird name . I 'm Sonoshee . Sonoshee . With REDLINE being just a day away , we should keep our eyes on the racers trying to enter Roboworld . For this non-stop road race in the military exercise base , each driver 's chosen course will be the key . We 've been profiling the REDLINE racers every evening . On the eve of the big race , we feature JP , who 's entering only because another racer has dropped out . Like Lynchman who 's notorious for his rough play , JP has a dark past of his own . According to our research , this man with a nickname of " Sweet JP " was indeed a race-fixing specialist in the past . No way ! The Racing Commission should seriously reconsider its — Lucky for me . It 's still running . The final day What was that ? I think it 's the Supergrass 's scout vessel . The army of that wicked wizard princess , huh ? So they teamed up with the REDLINE now , did they ? Back up , back up ... A bit more ... Stop ! Too bad you have to race without a test run . I 'll be fine . JP . Yeah ? You know the drill , right ? What I know is that it 's my show now . What 's that red smoke ? Ta-dah ! Nice work , Princess . That 's a piece of cake . Planet Supergrass Grass Hall Now , all we can do is to wait . We 're going there to win , okay ? I have just received information that the Supergrass 's Red Angels successfully marked the finish line by the Roboworld Tower . That 's our princess ! I guess she made it . Of course . She 's the only one who can use the remote magic . We must make her proud . Morning , Sonoshee ! Looks like you 're mad at me . Not really . We 're rivals now anyway . Once on the race track , friendship won 't count . I guess you 're right . Uh huh . Sonoshee . The ship will enter the drop zone in three minutes . Good luck , then . You see the transport ship ? Yes , Mr. President . Let 's say the line marked by our HQ is the finish line . At 800 km west above the expected start line : the Knockout Tower we detected an energy reading from a hyperdimensional drive . Hyperdimensional drive ? How dare they violate our airspace using navigation that 's supposed to exist only in theory ! I 'll teach those RED-RACERS a lesson ! Titan ! Arm the disintegrator cannons ! Yes , sir ! Bought your ticket yet ? Hey ! You put all on Sonoshee . Yeah , Sonoshee 's my girl . You 're the man ! Give me those pork buns ! Only three left . That 's okay . Hey , you ! You betting or not ? Not yet . I 'm waiting for the final odds . Hot ! What a mess ! You 're supposed to eat it in one bite . Okay guys , it 's the last call ! Anyone who wants to buy in , step up now . One minute to the start ! I 'm closing now ! Give me JP ! One minute to drop point . All racers , please prepare for the drop . Hyper-disintegrator cannons arming . 95 % energy level . Initiate firing sequence . Please put on your light shield , sir . We 're entering the drop zone . We have an energy reading of the transport ship . It 's out of hyperdimensional drive . Get it on the monitor . Open fire on visual contact . Aye-aye , sir . Fire the cannons ! Firing ! What 's wrong ? Why aren 't they firing ? We have a malfunction . What ? ! That 's unacceptable ! Good morning , all you lucky fans gathered here today . Five long years of waiting is finally over ! Machines are dropped from the sky to start the race ! They 're heading straight toward the Knockout Tower . If you 're looking for a long shot , he 's your man ! JP with his trademark ducktail . His odds are a whopping 25,000 to 1 ! What 's going on with that hair ? But his machine 's just as impressive . You see all kinds of designs imaginable in this race , but I don 't think anyone 's ever modified a car like JP . That sure is unique . I gotta love his dedication . Dedication ? Maybe . Or maybe his hair is affecting his brain . Announcer is me , the rattle-king Void Do . Commentator is the former RL champ , Mr. Minerva Hanness . Stay tuned ! Damn red racers ! Mr. President , let my troops take over from here . All right . Show them what you 've got ! All you brave soldiers . Our time has come ! Those racers 'll be approaching from three directions . Split into 3 groups to counter them ! Volton troops , move out ! Roger ! I 'm hit ! I 'm going down ! Here comes God Wing followed by Bustiesl Speed Master and Semimaru are right behind . God Wing made a splash landing . He 's immediately going for a counterattack ! What will you do now , Super Boins ? Holy cow ! They 're blazing away ! You won 't stand a chance unless you make a swift landing . Lynchman 's chasing after Sonoshee . Will he catch up ? Johnny ! Shoot the sidewinder into Crab Sonoshee . Okay ! Jesus , I 'm burning ! That bastard ! What the hell ? ! Huh ? Take this , you fools ! Hot ! No way ! Oh no ! Not bad , Colonel Volton . Thank you , sir . What ? I see . Sir , I just got word . We have another problem . What now ? It 's the broadcast ratings . 82 % of broadcast satellites in the M3 Nebula are now beaming live coverage of the REDLINE to the entire galaxy . In other words , every secret military asset and facility on Roboworld — Smash those racers before they reach zone 7X where Funky Boy 's sleeping . Funky Boy must not be awakened . He 's still a baby that just came out of the womb . He needs more time to learn listening ... Payback time ! Suckers ! Good job , No.3 engine ! Get a hold of this ! Crab Sonoshee 's charging up the slope . Bold move ! She may be able to take the shortcut , but Lynchcar and Transam have to go around . Johnny ! I see the dam ! Here we go ! I see you , Lynchman ! You finally caught up , huh ? I thought you retired . You wish ! I 'll show you ! Yes ! Now we 're even ! You wanna play , Sonoshee ? I 'm game ! Trava ... Regret leaving me behind in the army ? Captain Deyzuna ! What ? We spotted a moving target in 5 km west of here . Looks like a red racer . Okay . All vehicles , move to the target ! Roger . This one 's mine . I 'm gonna rip his head off ! That weasel ! He thinks he can beat me ? I 've been waiting for this a long time , Trava ! What the hell do you want ? My sand-biker 's gonna whip your sorry ass ! In your dreams , you pathetic little shit ! Come get me ! Now let 's check out what JP 's up to . He 's finally approaching the dam way behind the others . I think it 's time for JP to retire . Yeah , really . Everything 's out of balance ! Friggin ' Frisbee ... What 's wrong , JP ? Get her up to speed and you 're in the clear . Don 't be afraid to use the gold nitro . Never thought I 'd need this so soon . Go ! He 's skimming across ! Did you see that ? I don 't believe it ! He made it ! You gotta give it to him . That was impressive . He 's still way behind the rest , though . You 're late , Frisbee . How 's your friend doing so far ? JP 's holding the last place as we planned , so his odds will stay low . He 'll make his move in the last quarter , get his odds up , then he loses . Same as the last time . No problem . I 'm still worried that he may wanna win the race . That will cost me a great deal , you know . There 's no guarantee , is there ? You can relax . There won 't be any surprise . No ! Stop picking on us ! Oh no ! I 've had it ! Let 's roll ! Hi ! Coochy-coochy-coo . What 's going on , Big Deyzuna ? ! Two planes were down before I knew it . So you lost a couple of planes . No big deal . Use your head ! Sir ! Dr. Sabose ! Quit playing around with those pervs and tits ! Wipe out the racers in the southern sector already ! Sir ! Little Deyzuna ! Who told you you can leave the unit ? Sorry , sir ! I 'll do my best . Get back in formation and corner them to Zone 7X ! Are you listening to me ? Colonel Volton , please ! Don 't let this punk make a fool of me ! Stop raving and get a hold of yourself ! I repeat once more . Get back in formation and chase them to Zone 7X ! That is an order ! I 'm afraid I can 't take that order , sir . I 'm entering the race . Have you lost your mind ? You 'll be court-martialed and executed ! Colonel ... I know the risk , but I must do this . I promise victory ! No ! I can 't allow that ! Deyz ... Colonel Volton ! You gonna just stand by and watch ? What do you think ? Attention , all soldiers of Roboworld ! All units sally forth ! Intercept the racers in Zone 7X ! You said all units , Colonel ? You heard me ! Move out all units ! All racers are converging at the minefield in Zone 7X . God Wing takes the lead in the northern sector , followed by Super Boins . From the southern sector , Crab Sonoshee 's coming ! Trava 's Speed Master 's coming from the central sector , with Little Deyzuna right on his tail . Speed Master 's faster than those mines ' detonators ! We just got new footage . Gori Rider is burrowing through underground . Miki / Todoroki team runs right behind him . It may be a shortcut , but speed-wise ? I 'm not sure . Ouch ! You think we 've cleared 7X by now ? Probably . Let 's get out of here and take them down ! All right ! Let 's do this , Miki ! Go get them ! Gumption ! You sure about waking it up ? ( Zone 7X ) Underground Yeah . Bioweapon sleeping in the untouchable area , aka " Funky Boy . " We have to count on him to fight Volton 's troops . Gumption ! Gumption ! Coming out ! Gumption ! Miki and Todoroki are making their move . They took the lead ! Yes , Miki ! We 're the leader ! Land mine ! Looks like JP 's made it to Zone 7X somehow . What do you mean " somehow " ? Frisbee . You do know this is business ? Of course I do . What ? ! Look , it 's a carrier ! I see they decided to send the Air-Destroyer . Uh-oh ! Colonel Volton 's getting serious . He kicked me ! I have to end this ! Lynchman ! Johnny , come close to me . Okay ! Time to use the thunderbolt ! Rotate 120 degree ! On it ! Shit , I missed ! We did it ! Launch flare ! That should teach them a lesson . Those racers are as good as dead . There 's no need for any further attack . Mr. President , did you think I 'd stop now ? You can 't afford to take a pity on those scum . All right , then . Damn , I can 't break them . Yes , you can ! Just trust yourself ! What 's this place ? I 'm coming to get you , Sonoshee . That 's a bioweapon . Isn 't it against the peace treaty ? I have a feeling we 're not supposed to be seeing this . How is this possible ? This is a nightmare . Mr. President , we can 't let Funky Boy destroy Roboworld . It can get us in trouble for a breach of the peace treaty . We must take measures immediately . You must make a decision , sir ! Mr. President ! We have got the hyper-disintegrator cannons back on line . They 'll be ready to fire as soon as charging completes . Hail the President ! Target Funky Boy . He 's out of control ! Yes , sir . Target 's set . We 're ready to fire . Take him down in one shot ! Okay , give me the command . Fire the cannons ! Firing ! Princess ! Excellent ! We wiped them out clean . Energy discharge complete . We 're going to the recharge . This can 't be happening . Are they really dead ? I don 't believe this . They actually used hyper-disintegrator cannons . It looks like everyone 's been wiped out . That bastard planted something ! Sonoshee , you all right ? JP . You okay , Captain Sabose ? I 'm fine . How many planes are left ? 18 including the ones that got damaged . 16 sand-bikers left in another unit . The crow jet unit 's wiped out . I see ... Red racers are in equally bad shape . Wait for Colonel Volton 's order . Roger out . You came all this way to win REDLINE , right ? I 'm only halfway there . I didn 't get to see the finish line . I 'll show you . Not much room , but you don 't mind , do you ? Machine 's gonna be too heavy . You can 't win . Yes , I will ! We 'll win this together . That 's sweet , JP , but I have to ask you something . Ask me later . We 've got a race to run . No . I need to ask you now . Okay , shoot . Have you been arrested for fixing a race ? Yeah . What happened ? It was the Yellow MAX series eight years ago . Our team was on a hot winning streak . Frisbee decided to hook up with the mafia , so he could get a better engine and parts . I entered the race with his life on the line ... and I lost . After that , he desperately needed the money . But there was a sting operation against the Inuki gang . Frisbee was trapped . That friggin ' Frisbee 's gonna get JP killed ! So you went to prison for him . He believed in me and risked his life so I could race . I always owe him for that . Then we 'll just have to pay him back with this race ! You 're gonna help me ? If you 're gonna help my dream come true . It 's a deal ! He 's got a self-renewal ability . Must have been some pieces of him left . Secretary Titan ! Fire the hyper-disintegrator cannons again ! Negative . We need another two hours to recharge it . Where 's Volton now ? I never thought I 'd see the day . Is it ready ? Yes , it 's ready ! Can we control it ? With your skill , no problem . You just like the idea of getting new data , don 't you ? Very well . Proceed . Oh , no ! Princess ! This feels great ! Wonderful ! I can feel the power ! Let 's get out of here , Shinkai ! Okay ! All right ! Gori-police custom rider ! You morons ! Red racers are running again . Go after them , now ! Yes , sir ! We should get going . This is the machine your friend built ... Yeah . You ready ? Yeah . With the beefed up stove you gave me , Sonoshee and I will blast to the top ! Your friend has done well . Yes . It 's time we wrapped this up . We 're in third . The odds are looking up . That should give us enough . No point in getting greedy and ending up in the hole . It 's time for Plan B. Wait till JP grabs the lead , please . You promised me ! Then here 's a check ! I double your pay this time . Take it ! We 're running out of time . I 'm paying both you and JP enough money . So what are you complaining ? Gimme the detonator ! I just gotta see the race to the end . Please . Us , no ... I wanna see him win ! Sorry , buddy . You know I 'm just doing my job , right ? I don 't wanna hurt you . Just hand me the damn thing . Over my dead body ! Suit yourself . You 're dead ! Bye-bye ! Old man , why are you here ? I 'll keep this with me for now . I didn 't come here to save you , mind you ! It 's just the team mechanic 's gotta see the race through . The driver , the mechanic , and the junk dealer ... Those three make a team , right ? God Wing in the lead is struggling to take control . This time around , he sustained quite a bit of damage . Hey ! Clear the way ! Jesus ! Have you no concern for the road ? I 'm having a ball ! Out-course is clear ! Can 't get there at this speed . There ! Go for it ! You 're here . I 've got you now . Are you bold enough to use the steamlight , Sonoshee ? Huh ? That 's the same as yours ... As a courtesy to stubborn racers like you , I 'm trying to make this interesting . Bring it on ! Behold the platinum nitro charge ! Platinum nitro charge by Machine Head ! The only man to master the steamlight . Looks like the king 's gonna win again ! Hey , Sonoshee ! We made a deal . Make my dream come true , JP ! Second spot is mine ! Think you can get me ? ! That fool ! Steamlight ? ! No man can handle that ! You can do it , JP ! You serious ? Dunno . Funny guy , huh ? Let 's see what he 's got . Let 's roll , Todoroki ! Gumption ! Sorry , Deyzuna . Time 's up . Let 's go , Shinkai ! Here we come ! Don 't leave me ! Too hard to track . We won 't catch up with them . Hold on a minute ! Huh ? The finish line is on top of the Dest Tower . No one can climb up the wall to reach the line ! What 's gonna happen ? What 's the plan ? You 'll see . Just watch . What ? ! Oh my ! REDLINE committee 's mothership came out of hyperdimensional drive under the Dest Tower and became the final straightaway ! You see it now ? The final straightaway got joined to the finish line ! Sonoshee ! You ready ? JP 's moving up like a bullet ! What 's going on ? Holy cow ! Unbelievable ! I 'm gonna win ! I 'm the king of kings ! You know what that means ? It means the victory belongs to me ! I 'm gonna win ! I 've got the goddess on my side ! Look at that ! JP and Sonoshee are coming ! I see it . JP ! You need the edge to win REDLINE ! You don 't deserve to win this race ! Goddamn it ! I need something to spark this thing up ... Frisbee , got anything ? ! You used them all . Whoa ! JP 's engine got blown off ! But wait ... he 's picking up speed somehow ! Victory 's mine , JP ! JP ! Sonoshee ! It 's JP and Sonoshee ! They are the winners ! JP and Sonoshee came in first at the finish line ! JP ! JP ! Sonoshee ! Sonoshee ! He 's done it ! Interesting ... Aw , that 's beautiful . Sonoshee . I love you . I love you too , JP .

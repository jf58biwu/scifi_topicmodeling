 MR SMITH : Are you aware that Luke has brought an unidentified element of alien technology ? Mrs Nelson-Stanley gave it to me and I had to keep it a secret . When weirdo nuns turn up on your doorstep asking about freaky glowing alien gizmos , never tell them you got one . - The Talisman is dangerous ? - More than you can imagine . No way ! Luke ! Luke , he 's been nabbed by a nun . SARAH JANE : Are you really protecting a Gorgon here ? A creature with writhing serpents for hair ? The sisters , they protect her . Look on the face of the Gorgon and feel your flesh turn to stone . - Don 't look , Maria . - The door was open . Dad ! Get out ! Dad ! After 3000 years , the doorway to your people can be opened again . - And what then ? Invasion ? - The Gorgons need us to survive . Opening the portal to their world isn 't opening the door to invasion , but salvation . - What have you done to my dad ? - Pay heed to the warning and don 't interfere . Dad ! Mother Abbess . He can 't be . He can 't . I didn 't mean to shout at you , Dad . I 'm so sorry . You are not going to lose it , you are not going to fall apart . Whatever has happened , there is one thing I 've learned , there 's always a chance . Do you hear me ? Mum was right . I shouldn 't have had anything to do with you . It 's all your fault . You and your aliens ! I wish I 'd never seen one ! I wish I 'd never seen you ! Everything was fine till we moved here ! Everything was fine ! I know , Maria . But we have to try . We have to try to put things right . What 's happening , Luke ? Is Sarah Jane going to give the Gorgon the Talisman ? Of course not . If the Gorgon wanted to go home , then why would Mrs Nelson-Stanley be so scared ? - Mum knows that . She 'll trick them . - Are you sure of that ? What if she doesn 't ? She won 't let us down . She 'll get us out of this . We should be looking for a way of escaping , not catching up on our reading . It 's the history of the abbey . It was built in the 1 6th century . - Banging . - That was when priests were being hunted . I can get a history lesson off Mrs Pittman . Houses were built with escape rooms and secret passages . Houses like this one . MR SMITH : Mr Jackson has undergone massive molecular transmutation . - We know that . He 's been turned to stone . - Not stone . Not strictly speaking . - It 's an organic petrification process . - Like fossilisation ? It is comparable . And Mr Jackson hasn 't turned , but is turning . The process isn 't complete ? Could it be reversed ? - Theoretically . - What does that mean ? It can be done . The molecular transmutation isn 't yet stable . But I don 't know how to do it . - You 've got to save my dad ! - I 'm not sure there is sufficient time . My scan suggests molecular stabilisation will be complete in 90 minutes . There must be something you can do . I can only be realistic . And to be candid , things look worse for you all the time . - You 've got to help us . - Perhaps if I were more familiar with the Gorgon . Bea ! She might know something ! But Bea has Alzheimer 's . Her mind is trapped in the past . That 's where she met the Gorgon ! We 've only got till 4 : 00 . Like I said , there 's always a chance . Let 's get going . This way . I 'd rather take my chances with the Gorgon than make like a mole through any more tunnels . Whoa ! Why couldn 't they get garden gnomes ? - It 's put them on show . Like trophies . - Or a warning . Let 's get out of here . I 'll have to leave you here on your own . I wish I could help you , but I have to find Luke and Clyde . Everything Bea knows is still inside her head . You just have to find a way to unlock it . I never should have let any of you get involved . I 'm sorry about what I said . It 's not your fault . I wanted to see aliens . Who wouldn 't ? If there 's a way of saving your dad , I know you 're going to do it . We have the key . Rejoice , sisters , the Gorgons shall be free ! - Mother Abbess ! - She is weakening . We must open the portal as soon as possible . - Now , while the coast is clear ! - I can 't . - What ? - I promised Mrs Nelson-Stanley I wouldn 't let them take the Talisman . Did she tell you you 'd be going up against a Gorgon - and you 'd probably end up a garden ornament ? - No . She wasn 't straight with you , Luke . Mum wouldn 't have given them the Talisman unless something happened . You mean that thing ... Sarah Jane and Maria ? I know that I 'm not going to let the Gorgon win . But I 'm going to need your help . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Come in . Bea ? Hello , it 's Maria . - Do you remember me ? - Hello , darling . - You 're a little young , aren 't you ? - Young ? To be the curator of the Museum of Egyptology . ALL : ( CHANTING ) Serve the Gorgon . Serve the Gorgon . Behold , the key to the portal . After 3000 years , our work here comes to an end , and our world is on the threshold of a new age . The Gorgon world is a hundred million light-years away and the angle of ascension must be aligned perfectly . The trans-dimensional occlusion is forming . Alignment is at 20 % . Only an hour before the portal opens and your people shall join you . The Gorgons shall have their promised land . ( GORGON HISSING ) The time grows short . The host is dying . We need to find a new carrier before the portal opens . Bea . Bea , please help me . ( GOOD NIGHT , SWEETHEARTPLAYING ) You have to tell me about the Gorgon . Edgar and I danced to this in the palace ... In the palace of the Sultan of Ishkanbah . - Do you know the Sultan ? - No . I 've never even heard of ... The Gorgon has turned my dad into stone , and if you don 't help me , I 'm never going to get him back . The Sultan was such a fascinating man . He 'd seen the yeti , you know . Tell me about the things you 've seen . I 've seen things with Sarah Jane . Who 's Sarah Jane ? Do I know her ? It 's silly , but I keep forgetting . Sarah Jane has seen aliens and monsters on Earth , even other planets . She 's had hundreds of adventures , just like you and Edgar did . Edgar . ( BEEPING ) If only I could hear his voice again . Just once . We had adventures once . Such adventures . But no one believes me now . No one listens to you when you 're old . I believe you , Bea . Bea ? ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Maria ? Are you in there ? Alan ? ( SIGHS ) The woman 's obsessed ! She really is a bunny boiler , this one . Couldn 't have the real thing , so she 's made herself a statue . I bet you 'd be flattered if you knew . You didn 't know , did you ? So it 's come to this , has it ? Talking to a statue instead of the real thing . Maybe her and me aren 't so different . We both have to make do with what we can . Difference is , she doesn 't know what she 's missing , does she ? Still , you 're all right . Anyone can see that . You and Maria get along great . Better off without me messing things up . Like I said , I can make do , till I mess things up again . Which I will , ' cause I 'm me , aren 't I ? Anyway , been nice talking to you . - Alignment is at 45 % . - Good . - But the Mother Abbess ? - Her strength is failing . We will select a new host . Soon the Gorgons and humanity will be one . All right , Quasimodo , time to do your thing . ( BELL RINGING ) What on earth ? Find out what 's going on ! Stop him ! NUNS : ( CHANTING ) Serve the Gorgon . Have you got it ? There 's loads of them ! They 're everywhere ! Boys , quick ! This way ! NUNS : ( CHANTING ) Serve the Gorgon . Serve the Gorgon . Serve the Gorgon . Serve the Gorgon . Serve the Gorgon . Serve the Gorgon . Serve the Gorgon . Serve the Gorgon . Your lipstick thing would have had this licked . Shame the nuns made me check my bag in at the door . - I hope Maria 's having better luck . - We don 't need any Star Trek gadgets . This place is full of secret passages . Luke read about it . He 's got it all filed in his brain . - I don 't remember any down here . - All the same , it 's worth trying . Mum , I think the Gorgon 's dying . - Why ? - We saw her stumble earlier , like she was sick . I heard Sister Helena saying they needed to find a new host . She said when the portals open , humanity and the Gorgon will be one . That 's what she meant . Helena said the Gorgons needed us to survive . - I don 't think the Abbess is the Gorgon . - What ? ( KEYS JINGLING ) Miss Smith , will you come with us ? - I 'll be fine . - Don 't worry . We won 't harm a hair on her head . We 've got to find a way out of here . Sarah Jane was right , wasn 't she ? I thought meeting creatures was going to be exciting , but she told me , she said it wasn 't anything like that . In the end , it just messes you up , your whole life and the people you love . That 's why Sarah Jane 's always been on her own . That 's why you 're here , isn 't it , Bea ? With no one in the world who knows you or cares . This is how we all end up , isn 't it ? I had my Edgar . You 're young , you 'll find yours . - Bea , are you really there ? - Where else would I be ? The Gorgon has turned my father into stone . Is there a way to save him ? Your father ? Oh , dear . That 's most unpleasant . I should know , it happened to me . - It turned you into stone ? - The nuns were after the Talisman . But Edgar saved you . How ? The Talisman , it is the key to the door between this world and theirs , but it 's more . It returned me to flesh and blood . The Talisman . The Gorgon 's got it . You must get it back . Not only for your father , but for every soul on Earth ! Thank you , Bea . Not so fast , young lady . Would you fetch me my mirror ? No , not for me ! Do you think I 'm going to powder my nose - while you take on that monster ? It 's for you ! - For me ? Whatever do they teach you in school these days ? What makes you think the Gorgons still want to invade ? - Three thousand years is a long time . - Not for the Gorgons . Without host bodies to carry them ? - The Gorgons are parasites , aren 't they ? - It 's such an unattractive word . It 's what they are . A life form that lives on another . That depends on another to feed and survive . The Gorgon gives its host life beyond human years . The Abbess has carried the Gorgon for 200 years . Although there have been many hosts . And now she grows weak . Her time is coming . And the Gorgons have chosen a new host . ( GORGON HISSING ) You , Miss Smith . - You 're gonna dig a tunnel ? - No . I 'm going to make a screwdriver . Not long now , Miss Smith . As the Abbess weakens , the Gorgon will release its hold on her , and you will become leader of a new race ruling planet Earth . You can do what you want to me , but this planet will never bow down to that thing . - LUKE : We need a plan . - When we get a chance , we 'll figure one out . Meantime , we need to find Sarah Jane . The portal is opening . The Gorgons are coming . Their new queen must be ready to meet them . Bring the host forward . Don 't struggle . Embrace your destiny . The Gorgon is controlling all of you ! Fight it ! They 'll destroy the human race ! No ! The Gorgons shall save us from war , greed . We will exist only to serve them . We will be at peace everlasting ! And you shall be our queen . To receive the Gorgon , do not look into its eyes . To do so will turn you to stone . I 'd rather be a lump of granite ! You don 't have a choice , Miss Smith . Prepare to serve the Gorgon ! ( GORGON HISSING ) NUNS : ( CHANTING ) Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! - Mum ! - SARAH JANE : Luke ! Hold them ! They can witness the transfer and be the new queen 's first prey . No ! Where am I ? What 's going on ? You 're free . The Gorgon 's lost its control over you . - They 're coming through ! - No ! CLYDE : Come on , Maria ! - What about your father ? - MARIA : Come on ! - What if it doesn 't work ? - It saved Bea , it 'll save your father . You 've only got a couple of minutes . Dad ! He 's alive , he 's just unconscious . - We have to get him out of here . - Careful . I 've been looking for you . It 's been ages . I must have been overdoing it a bit . I went out looking for Maria , and I must have sat down and dozed off . - CHRISSIE : Another disappearing Jackson ! - I am so sorry about earlier . No , I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have yelled and run off like that . It was stupid . I could have lost you forever . It was only a tiff . You 're never gonna lose me . - Do you know what that woman has ? Come ! - What ? - A statue of Dad . - A statue of me ? But why ? - Because she 's a nutter . - Mum , there isn 't a statue . There is ! What was it you were looking for , Mrs Jackson ? What have you done with it ? It was right here . - Bold as you like , a statue of my Alan . - I don 't know what ... - I know what I saw . Where is it ? - I have no idea what you 're talking about . Come on , Mum . Maybe we should go home , hmm ? Pity , really . I think I 'd look good as one of those Greek statues . Prefer you the way you are . - Sorry , but Ivan 's in floods on the phone . - It 's all right . I understand . I know we 're not under the same roof , but I 'm always there for you . And I 'll always be here for you . Okay ? Always . I wasn 't seeing things . I know what I saw . Listen to your mum . Stay away from that Mary Jane . There 's something not right about her . Meter 's running . Mum 's back with Ivan , so it 's just me and Dad again . If the Talisman was the key to the portal , how could it turn my dad back ? MR SMITH : Matter has an atomic default . Some alien technology uses this to turn things on and off . Such technology can reverse cellular distortion . - It can make things the way they used to be ? - Fortunately for you . - Maybe it could help Bea . - I don 't know . Bea has Alzheimer 's . Besides , she had the Talisman all that time . Luke said it was hidden in a box . Maybe she hasn 't touched it . Oh , I don 't know , Maria . But she helped save my dad . If it could change him back from stone ... Please , we have to try . ( HUMMING ) Hello , Bea . It 's Maria . I 've got something that belongs to you . Is it my compact ? I 'm always leaving it lying about . - Edgar says I 'll lose my head one of these days . - No . It 's something Edgar gave you . Oh , no , you must put it back where I hid it . You must put it back in case ... It 's all right . They 're never going to come looking for it . The Gorgon is dead . Everything 's going to be all right . Is it true ? - Edgar gave it to me , you know . - I know . But he 's been gone for so long . I 've always been scared to wear this . Oh , it 's so beautiful . You know , he put this round my neck and he kissed me for the first time and told me that he loved me . EDGAR : I will always love you , Bea . Oh , Edgar . Thank you for bringing him back to me . You shouldn 't be upset . The Talisman didn 't cure Bea , but it did something amazing all the same . It gave her peace . - She was lucky to have Edgar , wasn 't she ? - I suppose she was . Don 't you wish you 'd found someone special ? Oh , I think I have . For the second time . Now let 's get back . The Viszeran Royal Fleet are passing through the solar system . All 600 ships . Only takes a few seconds , but it is the most magnificent stellar light show this side of the galaxy . MARIA : Have all these kids gone missing ? Me and Mr Kudlak run a special competition for the more skilled competitors . ( GROWLING ) CLYDE : This is like Premier League for laser tag . Do you think you 're man enough to have a go ? Soon you shall have all the children you need . SARAH JANE : Twenty-four children have disappeared at Combat 3000 . GRANTHAM : Don 't worry about them . The ultimate warrior of the future is always on guard for a surprise attack . Perhaps I can help . Goodbye , Miss Smith . ( GROWLS ) DVD Rip by DrMatt 2008

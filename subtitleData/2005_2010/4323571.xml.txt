 Previously : There 's been a SARS-like case reported in Denver Colorado , the local doctors and public health officials can 't identify the virus . This is doubled in just the last two hours . Can 't be ... I went to Nunavut . There was a body , frozen , buried . A minor who died of the Spanish Flu in 1918 and I dug him up without permission . I took a sample . I 'm really fucked up this time . Other than the head trauma and a few fractured ribs and some other minor injuries , very lucky . What 's he doing here ? He gets in a car accident , now he thinks he let out the Spanish flu . How did a flu in Nunavut - end up in Denver , Colorado ? - I don 't know . Beard , accent - Russian or Polish - mid-sixties . Look , we drink and we talk . He says I told him about Nunavut one night when we got drunk together . You gave me the Spanish Flu . You went and dug up the body , didn 't you ? Not interested . - It 's me , Bob . - Go home , Bob . - Are you okay ? - Just dandy . Then let me in . Fuck just go , Bob ! I have to go to the bathroom . I lied . David , I was so worried when you left the lab , I couldn 't work . - Where are you going ? - Haven 't a clue . Well , how will you know when you get there ? David , the outbreak in Denver wasn 't your fault . I got drunk and told a psychopath where to find a sample of the Spanish Flu so he could release it on the public , Bob . Thirteen people are now dead because of me , got it ? No . Not because of you . The Spanish Flu killed them . Oh ... Fuck it ! Passport . Wallet . Lock the door on your way out , Bob . Bye . Episode 2x01 - China SIX WEEKS LATER Why do you think you 're here , Ms. Morrison ? - I have no idea . - There 's been a breach of protocol . I honestly don 't know . This is because David was gone for a while . He got in contact with us . Then you were able to find where he was . - I have no idea . I 'm with Homeland Security , my name 's Agent Smith , and I want to ask you a few questions . What ... what exactly would you like to know ? Carlos Serrano , I am 39 years old . I work for NorBAC . I 'm a geneticist and medical doctor . I have not spoken to David in many weeks . He needed a break . He was burnt out . I think he just needed to get away for some time . It 's appropriate for David to go somewhere like China . Smooth . Did you get that ? All right . All in , all in , all in . Mayko Tran . Head of Bio-informatics . Yeah . He 's annoying . He 's stubborn . He thinks he 's the shit and he doesn 't have room for very many people and don 't get me wrong there 's a fucking lot to dislike about David ... But , you know , he 's got some really good positives that sort of ... outweigh the bads . Jesus ! English ? I 'm a fat man . I 'm a fat man . He says he 's Canadian . Oh , fuck . My name is Weston Field , 32 years old and I 'm the lab manager here . I 've been getting scattered information . Bits and pieces . Nothing that I can form a cohesive whole out of . And to be perfectly honest , I don 't know what David 's doing in China . I don 't know when David 's coming in . General Hung . People 's Liberation Army . Dr. David Sandstrom , NorBAC ? No , Dr. David Sandstrom , Canadian tourist . We have a disease outbreak . Well , I don 't do disease outbreaks anymore , so ... Come . This is one of 4 quarantine encampments . Two more will be constructed today . This disease is out of control . Began 19 days ago . Twenty-two dead ... yesterday . Old , young , 2 in 3 die . Well , congratulations , you got yourselves an epidemic . What does World Health say ? Oh , shit . You didn 't tell them , did you ? What are you waiting for , Captain ? A million dead ? General , I am general ! Come . Samples . From sick dead . And here , best scientists in China . Dr Xue , Molecular biology . Dr Zhao , Microbiology . Dr David Sandstrom . They have failed to solve the problem . You will show them how . Ah ! Dr Liu , Infectious diseases . Work hard . Solve problem . Excuse me . Coughing . Blood in mucus . We believe lung disease to be part of disease . We do blood plates , we find normal flora . So we know which bacteria group , but cannot identify specific bacterium . Why is this outbreak a secret ? Everything with Chinese military is a secret . OK . Tell me how you 're treating it , what have you tried . Everything : Cephalosporin , Quinolone , Cipro , penicillin . Combinations of 2 antibiotics , 3 antibiotics . OK , I get it , I get it . You 've tried everything that should kill a bacterium , and nothing did . Where does that take you ? A super-bacterium ? Drug resistant . How about , it 's not a bacterium at all . You know ? It could be any one of these other things , right ? Except we 've tried antivirals , anti-fungus , anti-parasites . Well then , maybe we need to find out where it 's coming from . Dr. Liu , ahem ... Sorry , could you ... Hmm , is this what I think it is ? Scarlet Fever . This sure as hell isn 't a scarlet fever outbreak . These people must be co-infected . Some have scarlet fever . Others have TB , mono , hep . A , hep . B. We 're supposed to figure out what 's making these people sick when they 're sick with all these other diseases ? Welcome to China , Dr Sandstrom . General . - Yes . - We got a problem . All your scientists have gotten nowhere . I got to the same nowhere . Now SARS was beaten by all the labs in the world collaborating . When China got blamed , SARS killed more careers than people . Go back . You can solve it . You solved Miranda Virus . No see , that was a group effort . The Spanish flu outbreak in Denver . That was NorBAC , which is why we have to contact them . I promise I won 't tell them where we are . No , no , no . General , how can you speak English and not understand it ? There 's too many complications . We 've got patients with multiple illnesses . Some of them have got worms and parasites . There 's experts from 3 different countries at NorBAC . - No , no , no . - Listen to him . He 's right . Look , I 'm gonna make this perfectly fucking simple for you , OK ? You 're on the verge of a major goddamn epidemic . If you don 't start asking for more help now , you are seriously , seriously fucked ! I am not fucked ! Now , go back work ! Go ! Go ! All right . Nobody knows you 're here . Twenty people a day , die . What 's another dead man ? ! Epidemic like this , Hung . You are looking at one , two million dead , easy . You may know science , but you do not know China . - No ! Don 't you have enough dead ? - After him , I 'll kill you too ! - Dead , he will be of no use . - He can 't help us anyway ! Ping , stay out of this . I had to save face , or he would have shot you . Any luck on the pathogens ? There are so many bacterial and viral species in the blood work . That 's where we were hours ago . We 've got to speed this up . OK , that 's it . I want to contact World Health . They are the experts on developing world medicine . - You can 't . - Would you look around you . How the hell are we supposed to solve this on our own . You 're feeling a little better , aren 't you ? This is my good friend , La Jiao . Hello , La Jiao . His parents died in the outbreak , and his sister . Ping . We need help . This program allows you to access any computer - outside the military network . - Fantastic . So you can get into your computer at NorBAC . Please hurry . Okay . Just write what you need to , we mustn 't get caught . Yeah I don 't need another gun to my head . Hey Mayko . Yeah , is there , like , a logical reason in the universe for me to get an e-mail from David 's computer in Chinese ? I don 't know . OK , well can you look into it ? Sure , I 've just got to do a couple of things for Caroline , - Forward it to my desk . - Thanks . People 's Liberation Army is famous for cuisine . Really ? Dr Sandstrom , I hear you in Tokyo . " Spanish Flu : There will be a sequel . " Yeah , I got that one right , eh ? Where 'd you guys learn to speak English ? Johns Hopkins post-doc . Four years . Mayo clinic . Two year fellowship . University of Oxford . Infectious diseases residency . Pretty impressive credentials . But we suck at this outbreak . Twenty-four new patients this morning . And that 's just here . Well , that was the only way I would do this , small and fast . I mean , we can be responding while the big government labs are still planning their intake meeting . So how many scientists work here ? Twenty-four PhDs and 30 techies . David handpicked everyone . Genomics , proteomics , biotech ... Caroline . Excuse me , I 've got Senator Jackman on line 6 . I 'll call back . This is biochemistry . Bob Melnikov , our department chief . Audrey Graves . American Drug Industry Council . Hi . Bio-informatics is back there . Can I get you a coffee ? - Yes . Decaf . - Of course . So tell me , what areas of research are you most interested in funding ? Well , Caroline we need to show Congress that some of our money is going towards basic research . So ... you tell us how our money can be best spent . Oh my God , do I need a coffee . Ahem ! Oh sorry ... Shit ... I mean , excuse me . I 've been up working all night . Not complaining , just not functioning . Hi , Mayko Tran . Pleasure . Carlos , I 'd like you to meet Audrey Graves . American Drug Industry Council . Carlos Serrano , our chief geneticist . You 're in Toronto for the AIDS conference ? - I 'll be speaking - About Africa ? - Yes . - Then I will be listening . How 's David Sandstrom 's recuperation ? It 's going great . - I found bacterium in water . - What kind of bacterium ? Same as in blood of sick people . Cannot identify . - Antibiotic resistant ? - Yes . The same . Here 's our guy . OK , morphology ? Right water . Left , from patient . Like the Olsen twins , don 't they ? The DNA gels . Tell me about the water around here . Water from lake , rivers and wells . It doesn 't make any sense . Why would you find a drug-resistant bacteria in lake and well water ? The only bacteria that are drug resistant develop in hospitals . MRSA . C-difficile . Exactly , we need to sequence a gene or 2 for each sample . We already got the genomic sequence from Beijing . OK , what 's this ? I mean where 's the analysis I can 't- - - General Hung won 't let- - - No , look . We need a bioinformatician , okay ? Mayko Tran is the very best I 've ever seen . Satellite phone . Hung will kill us if he finds out . One phone call for one watch . Only 3 minutes . I 'll barely have enough time to send all the data . - Cappuccino . - Wow , thank you . Carlos ? Check this . It 's coming in at 2,400 bps , but everyone streams at 45,000 . No , hackers don 't use 15 year old modems , Carlos . Is it Chinese or Japanese ? Chinese . Oh , shit , interrupting . OK , I don 't know if this is a coincidence , but this came in on the tip line . It was sent from David 's computer . David 's ? What do you mean ? Well , I mean it came from David 's computer . I don 't know what 's going on . It was all in gibberish , even in Chinese . This is what it says : Held by PLA . Outbreak . Many dead . I need help . Are you there ? I 'll get in touch with the Canadian Ambassador of China . I 'm on the e-mail address . - Is David Okay ? - He 's fine , Bob . How do you know ? Because I know David . OK , it got interrupted right here . It came in at 2,400 bps . Satellite phones transfer at 2,400 bps . OK . Wes ? Try to trace this transmission if you could . He said something about an outbreak . We only got part of the information . - I 'm doing database searches to ID it . - Okay . Beijing line 6 . Canadian ambassador , her name is Lise Goyer . Mrs. Goyer , good evening . We lost a Canadian citizen . He 's the head scientist at NorBAC , yes . Because I know David . OK , it got interrupted ... Hi ! Hi , Jill . Dr. Melnikov , you look fabulous . Come here . - Welcome home , Jill . - Thank you . - How was Oxford ? - It was good . It was good . I missed you , though . How are things going around here ? I don 't know . Something 's going on . Something with David . - Where is he ? - China . What ? Why ? I don 't know . Hmm . Well let 's go find out . We hear nothing from David for 6 weeks and now it looks like I 'm going to have to save him from the Chinese Army . Nothing ever changes , does it ? - Hello , welcome back . - Thank you . So the word in the U.K. is that NorBAC stopped the Spanish Flu in Denver . We did . - But David started it . - Jill ... welcome back . So what 's he into this time ? I 'll explain . I 've got to figure out a genome , I think it 's bacteria . Are you too jetlagged or can you pitch in ? Oh , no , no . I 'm in . Yeah , send me a copy . I 've just got to caffeine up . This just got here . So the data stream from David didn 't come from one of the global sat. systems . Chinese military . Nice work . - I 'll get through to David . - Okay . Connor McGuinn . Connor , it 's Caroline . Hey , Caroline , how 's it going ? We heard from David . Yeah ? That 's good news . Is he coming back ? I 'm sure he will . We got a call , we think it may have come from a PLA sat. phone . Got friends in the Chinese Army , Caroline ? Just one . What am I looking at ? We 're going to figure this out . Come on . We 'll figure this out . Well , there 's some really weird klebsiella kinda thing . A bacterium . Yeah . Klebs in your colon . It 's crucial to natural body functions , but if ingested or inhaled ... klebsiella can kill you . - So maybe that 's it ? - Or not . I also found bacillus cereus DNA . Food poisoning 's not a killer . That 's a weird combination . Yeah , I 'm thinking they were trying to sequence - 1 organism but got 2 by mistake . - That happens . Or this could all be one big transmission screw-up , because I also found one gene that repeats itself over and over again 100 times . Like in cancer . - But this isn 't cancer . - No . OK , so a bacterium has about four thousand genes , right ? And David sent us about a third ? Can we do anything ? Well if this is a freak combination of bacteria , I wouldn 't mind trying to figure out how it happened . And see if we can 't find out what 's missing . I 'll help . Have you tried doxycycline ? What 's left ? I 've been trying some new anti-microbials we just got from Beijing . He 's got a wife and daughter . I can 't even make a phone call to let them know he 's dying . Is there anything else new I should know about ? It 's growing , we 're getting more and more sick people every day . And from farther afield . Still , when I first came here , I thought this would spread a lot quicker . This isn 't the only hospital camp , David . There are now 12 others , and hundreds are dying . Oh fuck , what are we doing wrong ? Why can 't we figure this out ? Why 1 in 3 ? What are we missing ? Hello La Jiao . David . Da-wid . Daaa-vid . Daaa-wiiid . Excellent . Excellent . The 16 S ribosomal DNA seems to fit in there . Granulomatous over there . Citrobacter . Older , yeah . Right there . Is this making any sense ? It would help if we had all of its genes . It 's a big puzzle with most of the pieces missing , right ? Well what are we missing ? Hey Bob , what you doing ? Reduces fatigue , it sparks creativity . Oh . Yeah . Okay . Mayko 's got something . OK , so there . Right there , that 's a splice . Right . So that 's klebsiella and that 's the bacillus cereus . So it 's not a mistake . Oh , no . It 's a mistake , only it 's nature 's . And the repeating gene ? I 'm still working on it . - Hmm , OK . Thank you . - Okay . OK , so Mayko says ... Bob . Bob . Look at it upside down . What if it belongs like that ? See the top is at the bottom . We 're trying to see how it evolved . But it 's not a leaf . It 's a root . It 's not new , it 's ancient . That 's why we can 't see how it evolved . It didn 't . Everything evolved from it . He was right . We suck at this outbreak . OK , we 're getting somewhere . - It 's old klebsiella . - Old ? Very old . Caroline . Sorry . Connor McGuinn , line 1 . Hey Connor . That number you wanted ... Pretty interesting , Caroline , what 's going on ? What do you mean ? Just let me know how that call turns out . General Hung on the phone . Hello , I 'm Caroline Morrison from NorBAC in Canada . Dr David Sandstrom , Madame Caroline Morrison , NorBAC . - Hello . - David ? Caroline , what a surprise . - David we 're all here . - Yeah . Are you okay ? Where are you exactly ? Sorry Morrison . That 's classified . - Any idea what this bacterium is ? - It 's a freak . It 's got pieces of bacillus cereus and an old klebsiella . - David . - Hey Bob ! It 's like the great grandfather of today 's klebsiella . - Why is it drug resistant ? - Ahem , not a clue . Any idea how it 's getting around our natural defenses ? Well this species predates human life in China . So our bodies would have no memory of it . The receptors in the white blood cells don 't recognize it as dangerous . David , it 's got over a hundred repetitions of one gene . Really , why ? Don 't know yet . How many dead , David ? Fourteen hundred . David , where are you exactly ? We need to alert- - What 's the rush General ? It 's their nickel . Explain . How 2 bacteria mix ? Horizontal transfer . Which is a fancy way of saying the bacteria were promiscuous little bastards . They trade genetic material all the time . Even in cross-species barriers . OK , really simple . Let 's say I had a bact ... Let 's say I have a bacterium . We 'll call him David . And David is a happy little bacterium he 's just bopping along through life until he runs into a nasty piece of work called Hung . They trade DNA , and now , even though they look like they 're the same bacterium , they 're actually 2 new species . Havid and Dung . So Havid , he gets into your body , but your body doesn 't recognize him as being bad , because he still looks like David . And Havid divides every 20 minutes . And after a day there 's 10 million Havids and another 8 hours there 's 83 trillion . And because of what he got from Hung , all those Havids are pricks and they 're trying to kill you . The End . We send a sample to NorBAC , they help us figure out how to fucking kill it and we all live happily ever after . Oh Jesus . Ah , Caroline ! I 'm going back to the AIDS conference . Are you still interested in coming ? Yeah , later , I just want to stay on this China thing . Mmm . Anything new or ... I 'm not sure . We did make contact with David , - I just want to stay on it . - Of course . I 'll catch up with you later for Audrey 's speech . Absolutely . It 's a hybrid of klebsiella and bacillus cereus . Those bacteria are not drug resistant . Right . Antibiotics should be killing them , but they 're not . There 's something else . They found a gene that repeats 100 times . - What 's it for ? - They don 't know yet . Could be 100 flagella , a 100 cell membranes , 100 noses . These are simple bacteria , simple cells . What do they need 100 of anything for ? Hey , who let you out ? I get camera . Have a seat . - Carlos Serrano , NorBAC . - Sean Macpherson . You 're an AIDS doctor ? I was . Now I just do science . I just got back from Malawi . I worked in an MSF camp , near Lilongwe . I was there about 3 or 4 months ago . Volunteering at an AIDS orphanage in Mizuzu . - That 's tough . - Yeah . A lot of kids . Really alone . What do you think about handing out syringes and condoms to addicts ? It seems to be working in the US . The HIV / AIDS incidence rate has been slowly decreasing in the IDU population since the 1980 's . The operative word is slowly . - Better than not at all . - Yeah . It 's Stephen Lewis . Ever hear him talk ? - Not in person . - Wanna go ? Let 's go . ... the pandemic has such an irreversible grip . It is simply beyond belief . So , when we 're done here , where are you off to ? Maybe my lab , back in Beijing . And you ? Back to NorBAC ? I don 't think I can , really . Why not ? I did something , and a lot of people ... You know what , it 's a long story . I was a first year student at Beijing University . One day I asked 5 of my friends to join a protest . We rode on our bicycles and we demanded freedom of speech , and an end to corruption , and we felt like we were making something good happen . But then 3 of my friends died , instead . Tiananmen Square ? I 'm sorry . I spent 6 months sleeping and crying until I realized I didn 't have to act dead just because my friends were . Stop . Forget it . No antibiotics are going to work . Here 's why . Here 's our klebsiella / bacillus cereus hybrid . Those 100 repeating genes : membrane pumps . Membrane is porous . So whatever gets into the bacterium , if the bacterium doesn 't like it just pumps them right out . But why would it need 100 pumps ? Because it must be living somewhere with lots of things it doesn 't like . Exactly . Some place with a lot of salt or chemicals , but this bacteria is amazing at spitting things out . - Like antibiotics . - And so it 's drug resistant . And it 's ancient . It 's probably been disturbed so tell Hung he 's got to look for it in some shithole of a place full of , I don 't know , tar or acid . - Probably someplace underground . - Right . So where are we now ? Well , now we know no drugs can kill it , so there 's not much left . What does La Jiao have that Dr Zhao did not ? How can La Jiao 's body fight klebsiella when two-thirds can 't ? Maybe ... maybe , it 's not the klebsiella he fights . It 's the bacillus cereus . He must have been exposed to it once and now he has the antibodies to kill it . - And when he kills the bacillus cereus ... - He kills the klebsiella . Uh , bacillus cereus . It 's a bacterium that causes food poisoning in rice . You know , vomiting , diarrhea that sort of thing . But the thing is , our bodies can beat it . We think people who have had it are the same people who survived the hybrid klebsiella we found . Why ? Horizontal transfer . Havid and Dung . See klebsiella , it picked up some bacillus cereus DNA . So anyone who has had a bacillus cereus infection will probably develop an immunity . Because body knows it 's bad and kills it . Yeah , so in theory , we inject people with bacillus cereus they get sick , they recover , their bodies can fight it . Clever . Clever ! She nailed it . We need some guinea pigs . We need mammals . To test our hypothesis . First we give them the food poisoning , and then the bacterium that 's causing the outbreak . I will give you human mammals . Uh ... General , I don 't think so . General ! General ! general ! General , you can 't try this on people until we know it works . People die more and more . I cannot wait . Well what are you going to do grab somebody off the street and load them up with bacillus cereus ? - I do not see volunteers . - General , I volunteer . - Good ! - No , no ... Don 't even go there . Wait , wait . What are you saying ? This is my choice . I don 't care . Ping , if we 're wrong you 've got a two in three chance of dying . How can we be wrong ? Don 't do this . David , if it was your country , you would do the same . Doctor thank you for your assistance . No , no , Hung . I 'm not finished here yet . David ... Go home . Ms. Graves , can you tell us what the American Pharmaceutical Council is doing on the issue of AIDS ? Well , we have for the first time over one hundred new AIDS drugs in development . We are on the verge of a new generation of AIDS medicine . Injectable fusion inhibitors , gene therapy , inhibitory RNA ... - Are any pediatric drugs ? - Of course . How many ? - I don 't have that exact number . - None . Half a million kids die in Africa each year and you do no research whatsoever . Cause only a handful of kids in the West get AIDS . - You make drugs for markets not people . - What about patents ? We have given up our rights for patents in Africa . That 's not the issue . African kids are given adult drugs . No one knows the proper dosage . They 're told to cut them up . Sometimes the active ingredient isn 't even spread out in the pill . It is a nightmare . Hey , I have a question for you . How come there are hundreds of anti-depressants but not one pill for kids with AIDS ? - Listen to me . - Sean ! This has AIDS . It 's from Africa . It 's a new strain . Children are dying . Fourteen hundred a day , every day . Four million Africans go without any treatment whatsoever . They won 't even see the drugs you 're talking about . Besides , drugs are useless if there are no doctors to prescribe them . They 're useless if children are going hungry . Police ! Don 't move ! Sean ! Sean ! Carlos , what do I do ? Pull it out . Next on ReGenesis Are you having a boy or a girl ? Boy or girl ? Why are we doing this ? Audrey Graves has given us 35 million dollars for research . I had to leave Africa . We 're trying to trace back the strain to Patient Zero . - Simon Jessup . - You know I 've read about a British neuroscientist who 's been working with people exposed to Mad Cow . He 's developing out there tests with MRIs . Nobody knows I quit . NorBAC would have been finished . What were you going to do if I didn 't come back ? You did . David , we 've been infecting the cells in culture with Audrey 's HIV . Yeah . Bob , what 's the matter ? It 's what we call an escape mutant . So what then , should I just get on a plane to a lab that will do something for me ? Transcript : Raceman Subtitles : kubilai , Lama , teuteu42

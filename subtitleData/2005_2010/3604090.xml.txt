 Previously on dollhouse : Three years of my life are gone , Stolen by the dollhouse . She 's not right . She 's perfect . It 's like they made her just for me . I call it a disruptor . The gentle hum lets you know it 's working . Who the hell are you ? ! Ah , you forgot me already ? If I don 't stop rossum , no one will . Aah ! You 're not a doll . What the hell was that ? We 're going back to d.C. , So you can forget any of this ever happened . Here we are . What 's interesting to me is that you don 't call out to god . It isn 't a question Of faith , it 's just the vernacular . Anyone in this much pain prays , or At least curses , but We take god from you , too . You really are a shell . Why ? Now 's not the time for why . I like this void . This feeble , simple world . Just pain ... Over and over . No reason , no-no end , No in between . You can 't even pass out . I 've shut down everything that stands between you and Blinding , searing pain . Of course , I bluff . It won 't always be like this . When we get to the why That 's when it gets really bad . Cindy ... Please don 't let them do this . Do what , daniel ? It 's already been done . Don 't you get that ? I don 't want to forget who I am . Oh , baby . You don 't want to remember who you were . Even though that part 's always been there . What are you talking about ? You already know . You were a nobody Before we found you . Just a name . Everything you care about , Everything you hold most dear- - We gave you . That 's not true . Oh , you know it is . We took a spoiled , pampered , Selfish child , And we made a man out of him . A man the people could trust . Why ? We needed a senator , And you had the pedigree . No . You didn 't create me . I 'm going to expose you . You know that . See , that righteous indignation ? Yeah , we gave that to you , too . We spent three years building up your credibility . When you finally exonerate rossum At the senate hearings today , No one will question you . Why are you telling me this now ? Um ... Because it 's funny ? And because you 're not gonna remember in 20 minutes anyway . Which is also why I think I can say ... I can 't stand you . Having to be your wife , Letting you touch me , Pretending that when it doesn 't disgust me It doesn 't bore me ? That has been really hard . Feels good to get that out . This limo is nice , right ? Very fancy . You 're probably used to it . See , I definitely am not used to it . Your sole purpose here is to hack into the d.C. Mainframe And acquire senator perrin 's imprint . This will require stealth , clarity of purpose , and Above all , calm . Oh . Ah . Oh . Mmm . Good stuff . Drink ? No . Can I have one ? Absolutely not . Roger ! Shh . I ... Don 't like going outside of my comfort zone . our one and only chance for discovering Rossum 's plan is to pull it from the senator 's brain scan . There is no margin for error . So I would suggest That you expand your comfort zone immediately . It 's just water . It 'll help . It takes a lot out of you . We take a lot out of you . Do you know your name ? Echo . Do you remember your real name ? Caroline . You know . It 's good . It helps . And you know we took your memories . Is caroline in there ? Yes and no . This is one of my memories ... Of you . This is the last time I saw you . This is what you did to me . Not just to my arm . To me . I want you to feel this . There is something worse than pain . Adelle , sorry to have kept you waiting for a few minutes . 25 . Always so precise . And who 's this ? My chief programmer , topher brink . You 're a little out Of your jurisdiction , aren 't you ? You have my active . I 'd like her back . Geez , lighten up , will you ? So serious . It 's a serious situation . I trust we 'll find her undamaged . Well , here 's the thing , adelle . I 'm really not in a position to help you . Your girl got caught up in a major operation , And there are certain protocols that I just have to follow . I just can 't give her back to you . I have to get approval , and that may take time . You understand . Of course I do . Then why don 't the two of you just fly on back to los angeles , And the moment I get the go-ahead , We 'll ship your active right back to you ? Does that sound like a plan ? Absolutely . I 'll need mr . Brink To examine echo . Just to ensure my asset is intact . Adelle , where 's the trust ? Protocols . Mm . I 'll let my programmer know you 're coming . Business must be slow in l.A. If you 're here . Who 's minding the store ? Oh ! Oh , uh , we 've got our top guy covering for me . Only person in the world I trust . What you 're not getting , man friend , Is that this whole operation is dependant upon me . Not brain-constructy me , But bond , james bond me , which is Not so me . Vict ... Topher , all you have to do is stay calm . This from the guy who had to dismember my last little outing ? You get into their system , You make the connect so that we ... You can get a look At perrin 's brain map . I 'm not up to this . I suffer from acute agoraphobia . Or I plan to . Bennett halverson is the chief programmer At the d.C. Dollhouse . She 's a genius . I think she 's a genius , so , you know , double it . She 's just gonna look at my 1.0 , And his palms are gonna sweat , and she 's just ... She 'll know . I have to track down ballard . You just run the house and wait for yourself to call . It 's starting . The clammy . I 'm busy right ... I 'm sorry ? Topher brink ? Uh , of course . Hi . Mr. Brink . Uh , I , uh ... I 'm looking for bennett halverson . Can you tell me where ... ? Or you can show me where she ... It 's different . Yeah . Than l.A ... Uh ... Well , I suppose it would be . You probably have palm trees and Tans . We 're four stories underground . Not a lot of photosynthesis . No , no , you 're very pale . White . Pinkish-white . I mean ... Your skin ... Your skin is like a pig . Bennett halv ... Because it 's pink . People assume that pigs are bad , but I ... I love them . I like them . I hear they make good pets . I 'm bennett . I 'm ... You were looking for me . For realsies ? You 're bennett ? Not bennett junior ? You merged jams with esams to create next gen proteins ? You stud ! I ... I ... I 'm sorry ... That was ... Clammy hands . Well ... I 'm glad that you enjoyed the report . What 's up with your arm ? It 's ... Dead . From the shoulder ? Nerves are severed . You 're here for your active . Yes , um , echo . You won 't get her . What ? She interfered with a rossum directive . It 's unlikely that mr . Lipman will let her go . It 's unlikely mr . Lipman will have a choice . Can I see her ? Of course . She 's still unconscious . Courtesy of your device . Just a little project . Hardly . Is it weird that I asked about your arm ? I ... Honestly , it 's refreshing . So , adelle dewitt flies 3,000 miles Across country to pick up one doll ? Must be a special girl . They 're all special . Oh , yeah , but this one , she nearly took perrin from us . I think our programmer wouldn 't mind Wading around in that brain . And clearly , you can 't control her . I think maybe you 're just gonna have to walk away from this one . Do you honestly think it 's up to you ? Do you think anyone at rossum will take your side ? Harding ? You 're not much of a poker player , are you ? You got no cards , adelle . And you don 't know how to bluff . One for the road ? Now , stewart ... You and I have similar goals . I would like to think we could achieve a ... A mutually ... Beneficial ... Compromise . Compromise can be fun . If you don 't return my active , I will send someone to cut these off . You will be killed , horribly , Over a long period and never found . Now , look me in my eyes , stewart , And tell me if I 've learned how to bluff . Okay ! Compromise . So ... This is not my device . She 's been tranqued . It was probably one of the handlers . How do you work it ? The disruptor . How 'd you know it was called that ? What else would you call it ? Signal goes out for 50 yards But everywhere . That 's what messed up Your senator and ruined your evil plan . Oh , no . If you ... If you route the signal through here , It becomes directional . Not like a bomb , more like a taser . Huh . Huh . D-did you just try to tase me ? No , no , no . That would result in ... You 'd be unconscious . Why would I want that ? And it only works on actives . I 'm concerned that you may have just tried to tase me . No , I just ... You 're really bennett halverson . This conversation is becoming vague . Okay . So , we have had an active , whiskey , And she was rendered unengageable . So , we , I made her into a doctor . Uh , and you ... So , I thought maybe ... Similar ... . Bennett , the real bennett ... Would use an active to ... You thought ... Oh ... That 's idiotic . Actives are beautiful . Yeah . And it 's not my evil plan . It 's-it 's not evil . W-w-w-w-wait . Hey ! I 'm just here for echo . My last ethical quandary was ... Unhelpful . Let mommy and daddy do the squabbling . Bennett ... Yes , sir . Right away . Looks like you got the girl . Let me go check on- - is it " echo " ? - - And then get everything signed . Can I use your phone ? Just wanna check in with my house . Yes , of course . Wasabi peas . I 'm excited and scared . Finally ! Everything good there ? everything 's great , me-man , Except I 've got a long white beard from waiting . Put the signal through . Solid . I see what you see . Yeah . I still don 't know how I 'm gonna get perrin 's brain map running , But you can use this link to route it . Dude , halverson 's fine . What ? Wait ! Who ? What ? Bennett . She 's , what ? Like , distinguished ? Like young and fine , I poo you not . Are we into her ? We may be fierce on the subject . Oh , god , I wish I was there ! I mean , w-what 's she like ? Uh , totally shy , librarian energy through the roof . Glasses ? Glasses on a chain ! For the win ! Dude , she has a dead arm ! Like , dead ? Like , in a sling , with the glove ? Imagine john cassavetes in the fury as a hot chick . Which you know I often have . Oh , no ! We lose the connection ? Dude , she 's probably an active ! You 're so untrusting . Bree ? Bree ! Don 't go . Don 't go . We have to go . Come on . Come on ! Don 't leave me ! I 'm not gonna leave you . We 're both going . Now ! Good-bye , caroline . Bennett ? Bennett ? Are you okay ? wh-what happened ? Here , come here , come here . Look at me . Look at me . Can you tell me what happened ? It was echo . Oh , boy . Oh , boy ! Uh ... Oh , bad ! where is she ? She took perrin . Bree , wait . I 'm not bree . I 'm echo . Echo , what did they do to you ? She did this . But not to me . She ? Who ? I don 't understand . Who is " she " ? Don 't leave me ! Sorry , sister . I stay , we both get nabbed . She wanted me to know how it felt . It feels bad . You 're not making any sense . Were they imprinting you ? You don 't seem ... Finished . How do you know when you 're finished ? Listen to me . I think someone on the inside is trying to help us . They showed me the way out . Put it in my head so we could escape . We haven 't escaped . They 're coming . They always come . Because of this ... What 's that ? It 's how they find us . Gps tag ? We have to cut . I don 't think I can . You will . I 'll show you how . That 's where senator perrin will sit . He 's gonna make an opening statement , And then the hearing will begin . Okay , this is the press area here , so just Be prepared for a couple dozen camera lenses pointing at you . A couple dozen ? Don 't even think about that . Just focus on your testimony . Uh , where is the senator now ? He 's following up on some last - minute evidence we received . He wants all the ammunition against rossum we can get . oh ! Excuse me one moment . Hello ? Perrin escaped . I see . Can you explain how that happened ? Bennett was attacked by that l.A. Active- - echo . They 're together . Has he been wiped ? No . That is very unfortunate . We tracked their gps , we dispatched a retrieval team . I 've already sent you the coordinates . You need to be there when it goes down . On my way . ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ They won 't stop looking . We won 't stop running . Pull everybody in . I want every team on this . Well , figure it out ! Perrin has to be at that senate hearing In four hours , or rossum will have our heads . To be clear , this little project is your problem , not mine . Well , I 'll remind you of that When we 're bunk buddies in the attic . Hey , listen to this . She 's got a great idea . Oh . Well , it 's your idea . It 's based on your idea . No , no , no , no . But you should tell them . I can 't take the credit . Spit it out ! We might be able to reconfigure the disruptor To incapacitate echo and perrin without actually locating them . Explain . Topher 's disruptor sends a signal using a universal Frequency , which affects Every doll , but only within a limited range . If we use the neural electric biolinks , We can redirect the loop To target a specific brain . In english . Oh , wow . Okay , I do the english part ? That 's new . Okay . : Okay , okay . We can plug my disruptor into the biolink system And send the signal from here and put them to sleep . A painful , bleeding sleep- - But sleep , nonetheless . Right ? Genius ! She 's so good ! It 's your tech . How long will this Take to accomplish ? Topher : Uh , not long at all . I can have echo 's brain map uploaded into bennett 's system . I just need perrin 's . I gotta have a target . Give him whatever he needs . Topher brink ... Meet daniel perrin . Wow . It may be the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . Selective strand replacement takes a-a delicate hand . This is more than just an alteration . This is an imprint married To a ... An existing consciousness . It 's amazing You didn 't end up with a schizophrenic . I have a theory that the human brain Can hold multiple imprints and still function . A composite ? Not a composite . Something new . The original Daniel perrin is all there . I just ... Made him better . We 'll need your active 's map . Right . Uploaded . Oh . It 's very nice . She was kind of a hooker . Mm-hmm . How about ... While I build the magic bullets , you work on adapting your gun ? Right . Right . Um , You can , uh , use the whole workspace over there . Let 's hope when we zap them They 're not driving down the freeway or flying a biplane Or something , huh ? Yeah . You know , you probably Don 't even need to make delivery files . I bet we can just plug this baby straight into your biofeed ... Oh , I know . I just thought I 'd upload some sweet dreams To pass along . Compensate for the searing , searing pain . Oh . I like that . Uh , incoming . Is that it ? It 's me . The him-me . I 'm giving the word to myself . And what 's the word ? It ain 't " grease . " The he-me did it . I rock . We rock . The I-other-me has accessed perrin 's brain map . That may be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen . And wow ... It 's real . It 's all real . They didn 't program this . I grew up here . I wish they had . Why ? They didn 't create me . Only parts of me . How can I ever untangle it ? Does it matter ? What do you mean ? Does it matter who you were ? All that matters is who you decide to be . Who you can be . You make it sound so easy . It is . It 's all up to you . What , the voters don 't get a say ? The voters will say yes . I don 't know . At this stage , Might seem a little cynical . Like I was trading in on the family name . Oh , you would be . But it wouldn 't be cynical . You use what you have . Just think of all the good you could do . Even if I decided to run Do you have any idea How much dirt the opposition could throw at me ? Oh , I saw what you were doing when I walked into this party . But everybody 's got a past . It 's the future the voters care about . You show them that , all will be forgiven . Where did you come from ? Salinas , kansas . And don 't say I 'm not in kansas anymore . I 've heard that one . I know exactly where I am . And who I 'm talking to . Did it really happen ? Was she ever here ? Or was it something programmed into me In some basement somewhere ? Doesn 't matter . She was right . They made me into something better . You try to be your best . Yes . Even if I could , I don 't know if I want to be the man I was before . I understand . You do , don 't you ? I 'm afraid of caroline . If she comes back , Where will I go ? I don 't want to fall asleep . Even for a little while . You 're awake now . And so am I. That 's what they didn 't expect . They were going to use me as cover , but they didn 't get a chance To reprogram me . They 've created someone who can bring them down . And that 's what I 'm going to do . There 's still time . We can make it to the hearings . We can expose them . And then we can be who we are . We can be who we decide to be . Okay . Fire when ready . Daniel ? Daniel ? Uh , I got nothing on echo . That 's unusual . I think your senator 's filibustering . Wait ... What did you do ? Daniel , stop ! They 're in your head . You don 't have to listen ! You don 't have to be What they tell you to be . You can ... Belong to you . What do we see ? Who is it ? I 'm looking at a triggered sleeper . He 's not set on stun . And how 's the other one ? Uh , still alive , but spiking On every front . I don 't think she can match him . Get our new girlfriend to switch him off or bye-bye , echo . Roger that . You hacked into my system . You stole perrin 's brain map . You 're trying to kill echo . So we 're even ? Not even . Not even close . Shut him down . Now . Do you know who echo really is ? She 's a friend . Friend ? That shell ? I was her friend ! I was her best friend . This is what I got for it . This is my gift from caroline . This isn 't about caroline . This is about echo . They 're the same ! Caroline Has a power over people , And however well you wiped her , she clearly still does ! She has no power over ... When was the last time That you described a doll as your friend ? I know about alpha and ballard . You 're saying she doesn 't have Some power ? I 'm saying shut perrin down . It 's for the best . You were so close to perfect . You still with me ? Is bennett on board ? 'cause I don 't see ... Bennett 's out . I killed her ? I hit her . It hurt . Yeah , but we can 't just flip him back . We can if we isolate the neural path . Do you know how many ... Then shut up and work . I 'm already working . I wouldn 't hold your breath on the shutting up . No . I wouldn 't . Split up . Senator perrin . Senator perrin . Where is he ? Gone . Something else is here . Oh , god . Doll-speak . Watch her . I 'm going to go get the senator . Daniel ? Please answer me . Those things I said before- - None of them were true . I wanted to hurt you . They programmed you to love me , But the truth is , no one programmed me to love you . And I do . I love you , baby . Come with me . Things can be just like they were before . We can be happy again . Like before . Yes . And ever after . That 's right . Daniel , stop ! Daniel , daniel ! She 's got me locked out on this end . Who 's your back door man ? We 'll just pretend I didn 't say that . Yeah . Found the worm . Step on it . Squished . Oh , god . Oh , no , no . Oh , no . Oh , no . Cindy . Cin ! She 's broken . We have to go . I killed her . I just did this . No , it wasn 't you . It was them . Daniel , we have to go . You can still stop them , but they 're coming . If we don 't go now ... They 'll just make us forget ... Forget that I killed her . They killed her . If you let them make you forget , Then you killed her . Can you live with that , or can you trust me ? Senator , over here . Senator , over here ! Senator perrin . Where is mrs . Perrin ? I apologize to the committee for my ... My wife is dead . I , uh ... I don 't want to be here right now , But I 'm honestly afraid I may not have another chance to tell the truth . I was looking for a conspiracy , And I found something more horrible than ... The rossum corporation is the most powerful Medical research company in the world , But they are something else , as well . For the past several years , The rossum corporation has been a target . A target of a consortium of companies That would stop at nothing To undermine rossum and take its place In the medical community . They set me on rossum 's trail , And when I discovered the real truth , They put a bomb in my car . The car cindy took to stop by the family compound . My ... My wife was a victim . There have been hundreds of others . This woman , madeline costley , Is a victim- - of their manipulation And her own delusions . What ? There is no dollhouse . There are no sex slaves , No underground fortresses . Madeline costley spent the last three years In a mental institution in canada . No , no ! You know I was there . I have the documentation To prove it . In fact , I have documentation On all the companies involved in this ... Travesty . There is abuse here . Not the lurid , pulp fantasy They drilled into this unstable mind , But something more insidious , Something that has cost this country More than millions , And has cost me Everything . This hearing is adjourned until further notice . Senator , look over here ! Daniel ! Daniel ! Daniel , please . Madeline , these men are from the fbi . They need to speak with you . No . Echo 's just gone . And we 're certain she wasn 't apprehended with perrin ? My sources say no . They don 't have her . And mr . Ballard ? Still no word . Are-are we sure this is such a great idea ? I mean , I ... I am sensing tension ... Of the palpable sort . Just lie back . Finding him obstinate , are we ? Yes . Yes . This is so weird . This is so weird . Seriously , just a few more days . I could help analyzing perrin 's brain map . It wouldn 't be a second opinion . It would be the same opinion twice . There 's more to analyze ? I thought we now knew the senator 's function . To inoculate rossum against further scrutiny . More than that . He 's talking about new regulation , Which , inevitably , he 'll oversee . Rossum will be creating their own laws . Ah , good throw , boyd , But , uh , still doesn 't win you the giant stuffed panda . It looks like bennett somehow Rigged his sns into his higher functions . Meaning ? Let 's just say ... It 's an awful lot of ambition For a junior senator . I was going to say that . Did I fall asleep ? For a little while . Shall I go now ? For the love of god , yes . So , what are you saying ? They 're manufacturing a president ? Wouldn 't be the first time . Delightful . Well , before the fascist takeover , we need to find echo . She 's lost in the world in doll-state , Utterly helpless . I want every resource Engaged in her recovery . And madeline ? Poor girl . I 'm afraid there 's nothing more we can do . You don 't have to be afraid . I know how you feel . I know what it 's like to be betrayed . To be abandoned . She 's out there . They 're all out there , and ... We 're left behind . Alone . No one should be alone .

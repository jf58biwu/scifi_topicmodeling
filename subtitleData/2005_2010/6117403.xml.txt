 In the future , my son will lead mankind in a war against Skynet the computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time . Some to kill him . One to protect him . Today we fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . To change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Previously onTerminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . Mr. Ferguson is ill today . My name is Cromartie . Do we have a John Reese ? Excellent . You changed the future , you just didn 't change it enough . These things , they 're here . They 're programmed with specific missions . Took his eyes , James . Jumper , outside the gym . That 's my friend . The crying one from the bathroom . - We 've gotta help her now . - No . I could 've done something . I was right there . And what were you gonna do , be a hero ? Isn 't that what I 'm supposed to be ? A hero . Isn 't that who I am ? Patient is female , 33 . Previous lipo and breast augmentation with complications of seroma and scarring . Hello ? Hello ? When John was little , before bed , I used to read him fairy tales . One night , I read him a folktale called The Golem of Prague . The story of a clay monster made by a rabbi to protect the Jews of the city . You shouldn 't be back here , the office is closed . You do reconstructive surgery ? You need a consult . You 'll have to call Monday . I need reconstructive surgery . Look , you can either just leave now or I can call the police . Your choice . I failed to remember that at the end of the story the Golem turns on its maker and kills him as well as the rest of the town . Now . He didn 't sleep for months . I went to him and tried to tell him it wasn 't real , that I 'd made it all up . Somehow , that made it all worse . Up a little late ? Covalent and ionic bonding . No wonder you 're still up . I could never get my head around this either . It 's not that hard . So you wanna talk about it ? - Talk about what ? - You just seem down . Downer than usual . I 'm fine . John , I know what fine means . Fine means you 're upset and you won 't talk to me . Fine means I 'm fine . I saw there 's a memorial service at school this week for that girl . - Jordan . - Jordan , right . - Were you planning on going ? - I try not to make plans . Plans are for people in control of their own lives . I don 't want you to blame yourself for what happened . Who said I blame myself ? - What do you want ? - Cromartie 's here . - Now . - What ? I 've been monitoring the media for possible threats . Yesterday , arson at an Oakland dock forced the rerouting of a shipment of refined Coltan to the port of Los Angeles . - Coltan ? - Skynet will use it as a key element ... - ... in our endoskeletal alloy . It doesn 't mean Cromartie 's back . How can it be Cromartie ? - Are you forgetting that I blew his head off ? - I remember . That 's why I went to find this . You should watch . It won 't play . Put it on Video 2 . Oh . - Thank you for explaining . - Where 'd you get this ? Check the paper tomorrow for any dead anchormen . I don 't sleep . There . He came through . He knows we 're here . It 's just a head . His chip is intact . We 're programmed to repair ourselves . We 're programmed to blend in . He might still need Coltan for a missing piece . A leg , an arm . He will rebuild and continue his mission to hunt and kill . I know what his mission is . I still have the money from the safe house . We can go south , set up across the border , off the grid . Go south ? What ? I thought you said we weren 't gonna run anymore . We were gonna fight . This is different . You 're right . This is different . If Cromartie 's damaged , he 's vulnerable . We know where he 'll be . If he got new skin , he 'll have a new face . - We won 't know what he looks like . - But we know where he 'll be . I can hack the port 's schedule no problem . We find the container and we wait . We hunt him for a change . Or we could run again . The ship comes tonight ? - The one carrying the Coltan . - Five a.m. Like you 're gonna drive . Get the shotguns . It 's not like I can 't drive . And the C4 from the bathroom under the towels . - Cromartie ? - Not here yet . They 're humans . Keep setting the charges . If he comes for that Coltan , he 'll have to come through here . Is that Cromartie ? Cameron ? He 'll survive . - He 's human . - Not a very strong one . Mom . Those other guys just stole the truck . Does Cromartie have men working with him ? Does that happen ? You work with me . We have to follow that truck . Keep it steady . Lean forward . That 's Coltan . If that 's what you 're made of , no wonder you 're so dense . Not density . Heat resistance . T-600 models had a titanium alloy endoskeleton . But it was vulnerable to heat . Coltan alloys have a much higher melting point . You know what I love about you guys ? Even when you 've evolved into the ultimate , indestructible killing machine you 're not above self-examination and improvement . - Thank you . - Please shut up . Military tags ? - Leave it . - All right , you heard him . We need to move . Now . And how about we get paid now , seriously ? How about you shut up and go now ? Hey , hey . What are you doing ? He 's not damaged at all . That 's not Cromartie . Endoskeletal structure points don 't match . He 's too short . Another one ? Why does he have all this ? I thought these things just hunt and kill people . They perform whatever mission they 're programmed for . And what kind of mission is this ? Man , it weirds me out more and more . We barely get a crime scene up and the fbi 's here like that . Like you guys got some kind of magic powers or something . - Thanks , Lou . - Sure . Computers , my friend . Logging the weird blood sample that matches my other cases then , poof , I appear . Yeah , you 're gonna put us all out of work one of these days . Not that I 'll mind . Wouldn 't worry about that . Always gonna need somebody to clean up . So who we got here ? Dr. David Lyman . Plastic surgeon . Office manager found him this morning when she came to open up . Swabbed your weird blood out of the drain . Otherwise , the place is clean . Nothing missing . No motive . Zip . - So , what 's your interest here ? - I got six guys dead , no rhyme or reason . Except some kind of blood that isn 't quite blood . It 's not natural . I like natural . Natural 's reassuring . It helps me sleep at night . I meant more of the fbi 's interest . Oh . Well , ha , ha . You know the FBI . We 're interested in everything . So this guy ... Leaves Sunday a.m. It 's the only lead we have at the moment . I thought he looked familiar . He was a patient . We did his chin and nose last May . George Laszlo . We still have the charges , we can rig them at the door and blow them when they drive out . Cameron can take out- - Get in the car . We 're going . What ? John , the plan was to hunt Cromartie . - That 's not Cromartie . - So ? You wanna walk in , kick their asses and go for pancakes ? It doesn 't work like that . We 're outnumbered . - We have her . - We don 't know what 's going on . That thing has real estate . It has employees . Who knows how many more are in there ? There 's three of us . I 'm not saying we run but we need to step back . - See what 's going on . - So we run , in other words . Tell him to get in the car . - It 's too dangerous . We should go . - It 's always too dangerous . It 's war . War is dangerous . If you die they win . How many of those things , those endoskeletons do you think they can make out of that load of metal ? Because that 's what we 're talking about . It 's a truck full of enemy soldiers . What if they 're building them right here , right now ? If I can get myself onto the truck , we can track them by laptop . John Connor , we 're going . Now . Five hundred and thirty . - What ? - Endoskeletons . Based on the approximate volume of Coltan in the shipment that 's how many . John . Damn it , John . No . If they see us , they 'll find him . Yeah , we 'll get rid of them . Yeah , we just have a couple more to load . Here 's the route we 're taking . Drop some of this Coltan off . What do you think ? - You get Mark and let 's get going . - Got it . Okay , let 's roll . All right , guys . Come on . Hey ! You wanna tell me what you 're doing here ? - Have you seen a dachshund puppy ? - Huh ? They had Army uniforms . Tags . Where would they go ? They 're going north . John 's phone . You can track it online . This actually works ? Wait , wait , wait . No , no , no . The signal was lost . - The phone might be damaged . - Come on . Damn it . - Come on . - Breaking the computer won 't help . Do you have any idea what 's going on ? I lost him . I lost John . I understand . It 's impossible for you to understand . Without John , your life has no purpose . I can 't believe I let him talk me into this . You try to open your hands just a little and it 's too soon . Is it ? The world ends in four years . Come on . Come on . - What ? - Left you a message . Davidson was buying at Houston 's . When you didn 't show , they sent me to check to see if you died or something . - Did you die ? - You run across him on those Pico murders ? - John Doe 's ? Bar-code tats ? - No , who is he ? George Laszlo . Unemployed actor . Got him on video at the murder scene . Only suspect I got but this file is straight vanilla . Are you trying to impress a boss ? Wow , crank up the Sugar Ray and call Monica Lewinsky . It 's 1999 again . Sugar what ? James , you trying to get back on the rising-young-star list forget about it . I mean , this case is a dog . And you 're not young . Agent Stewart , can I help you ? You got some guy holed up in Room 3 . That would be my dog . Laszlo ? He asked if he needed a lawyer , I told him it was a courtesy thing . So , what 's this all about ? It 's about my case . Good case ? - We 'll find out soon enough . Did he strike you as a killer ? Everyone strikes me as a killer . So , George , you 're an actor . Been in anything I 've seen ? What is this about ? Just some questions related to Dr. Lyman 's death . So anything ? I see a lot of movies . It 's been slow . Well , it 's picking up around here , I 'll tell you that . I got six dead bodies and a mystery man who might be trying to change his identity . So is that why you got the work ? Chin and nose ? You kill a doctor to cover your tracks ? Dolores , meet Mr. Laszlo . I was hoping that he would give us a little blood sample . If you 're not my guy , you 're out of my file here in an hour tops . Make a fist . Great . Just a little sting . Can 't seem to find a vein . You guys are a bunch of fascists , you know that ? - Are you kidding me ? - No . Tell me where they went . Lady , go to hell . Where they went or I 'm gonna beat you to death . And don 't call me lady . Tell me where they went , damn it . If you beat him to death , he can 't tell us anything . - I 'm not gonna tell you anything . - Okay . Yeah , like you got the stones . You can go if you can get past her . McGuire Gunnery Range ? This place is the size of L.A. county . Where exactly are they ? She 's talking to you . Depot 37 . It 's a decommissioned arms depot in the southeast corner . If you take the outer loop , past all the old abandoned hangars . It was an Air Force base in the Cold War . I don 't know what they 're doing . I was to guard the warehouse and clean up when they left . The man just needed some guys . That 's all I know , I swear to God . Just drive faster . Badge , please . Your tax dollars at work . What , you need more blood ? What the- - ? Hey ! Aah ! What are you doing ? Let me go . Put me down . Put me- - Didn 't you lock this ? Yeah . Damn it . Damn it . Guy must have popped him . Been bitching about his money all week . You think he split ? You surprised ? Guy threatened to bail twice a day . Let 's finish and get out of here . Who tells Carter ? - You . He 's your friend . - Friend ? He 's just a guy I met . Six victims . Different parts of the city , different worlds , different lives . What 's the connection ? Greta was saying none . Guys in the house were drug dealers . But there 's some blood matches . And we got George here . George Laszlo . And who exactly is this guy ? - Actually , Jim- - - James , not Jim . James . Right . Right , apologies . Uh , before you go on , I just wanna make sure you 're aware Laszlo was clear . Blood sample came back . Not a match to the plastic-surgeon 's office . We got blood ? How 'd we manage that ? I , uh- - I finessed the samples . And , yes , I heard it didn 't match . But I 've been thinking of another possibility . Whoever killed Dr. Lyman was in there for two days . I 'm thinking there 's a chance our killer had himself cut to look like Laszlo . Forced the doctor to operate , then killed him . Yeah , but wouldn 't there be scars and bruising ? The office has a hyperbaric oxygen system which speeds healing . - And he could 've used makeup . - Actually , I considered this too . I asked the office manager . They keep detailed records of the anesthesia . According to their log , the levels were unchanged . No one had surgery . No one had anesthesia . - There 's a possibility they didn 't use any . - I asked that too . She said a job like that , four , five hours under the knife cutting that deep into the tissue of the face , the nose , the eyes you can 't take that kind of pain . It 's impossible . You got some kind of release from this Laszlo guy , right , for the blood ? Last thing we need 's a lawsuit . So if there isn 't anything else ... . Hey , sorry , Jim . Facts are facts . Ooh . Sorry about that . You know , if it doesn 't add up , it just doesn 't add up . It doesn 't add up because we don 't have all the numbers yet . James , nobody expects anything from you on this . Your ass is suitably covered . Why you wanna rock the boat ? Last time I had a case where this many things didn 't add up three people blew themselves up in a bank . Look , I don 't know , Greta . I just- - I just feel it . Well , maybe you should try feeling a little less because you 're going blind . Hey . Hey . You can 't just leave me here . You can 't- - Come on , hurry up . It would 've been faster to kill him . Sometimes you seem inefficient . I 'm not for you to understand . You said that before . Well , I do things , you know ? Stupid , illogical , inefficient things . Humans . Get used to it . I told the guy to just be patient . - Looks like he bailed . - So he 's gone ? Yeah , it doesn 't surprise me , he was bitching about the money all week . Then I wanna thank you for your service . This is it ? This is Depot 37 ? Did that guy lie to you ? No . This is it . - This is where the factory will be . - What factory ? Where I 'll be made . Me and many others . Right there . It 's inside . Coltan 's rare in the future . Much of it was destroyed when the bombs went off . He 's stockpiling it for after Judgment Day . It 's in the bunker where it 'll be safe . Hey . Shh . Your gun , give it to me now . I don 't have a gun . I don 't have anything . I didn 't shoot anyone . Your boss . - Hey , Carter . - Shh , shh , no , no , no . Just listen to me for a second . Just for a second , all right ? What 's your name ? - My name 's John . - What are you doing here ? I 'm just like you . In the wrong place at the wrong time . - What 's your name ? - Mike . All right , Mike , listen . We got a problem , okay ? Your boss , he 's a- - He 's a really bad guy . All right ? He killed those guys . And he 'll kill us if he finds us . So we need to get out of here . - Carter ? He shot them ? - You 've worked with this guy , right ? Have you noticed that something 's just off about him ? Like he 'd just kill you just because . So there 's something wrong with him , you know ? Yeah . - We 'll see if we can- - - No , no , no , don 't . This bastard owes me my money . I 'll take my share and theirs too . Hey . Freak . I 'm talking to you . Look , man , just open the door . Thank you for your service . What are you ? Come on , come on , please . It 's not your fault . Maybe it 's yours . If you had let him try to save that girl , let him think he had a choice in the matter . Maybe he wouldn 't have gone off the reservation . - John does these things . - Not the John I know . The John I know . - Hello ? - Mom . - John , thank God . - Mom . - We 're right outside . Are you all right ? - Yeah . But listen , he 's blocking the door . It 's like he 's frozen . He 's frozen ? Yeah , and when the door shut , it 's like he went to sleep or something . Standby . He completed his mission . He powered down to standby mode ... - ... until he 's moved or triggered awake . - Triggered ? The door . They put him into standby . Fifteen seconds . That 's the reboot time . John , listen to me . This is what I want you to do . I want you to open that door and run . The instant that door cracks open , you run . John . Yeah , I run . So , what do you think Future John would do right now ? We 'll see . John ? Come on ! - I thought you said you could drive . - It 's jammed or something . Step on the clutch . Hard . If you 're gonna be a hero , you gotta learn how to drive stick . - Let 's go . - Can 't he get out ? Drive . Mr. Laszlo . May I come in ? Thank you . Hey . Pepperoni ? Ha , ha . I love those things . My bosses told me I should stay clear of you . Legal reasons . I understand . But I thought I owed it to you to drop by . - Give you a warning . - A warning ? Well , there 's a chance , a small chance , but a chance that there 's someone out there who might be trying to steal your identity . Steal my identity ? - What would they do with that ? - What do people do with anything ? Steal , cheat , harm and intimidate others . Damage the national psyche . Anyway if you see or hear anything unusual , call me , any time . Thank you for your help . Sure . Hey , have a nice day . Have a nice day . Not every version of the Golem story ends badly . In one , the monster is a hero destroying all those that seek to harm its maker . In another , the Golem 's maker destroys his creature before it destroys the world . You okay ? I 'm fine . Really . How many times do we gotta have this talk ? A lot , I think . I should go finish my homework . The pride of men , of parents as well makes us believe that anything we create , we can control . Whether from clay or from metal it is in the nature of us to make our own monsters . Our children are alloys all , built from our own imperfect flesh . We animate them with magic . And never truly know what they will do .

 France , the year 1663 It 's Yann . Are you coming ? What 's that racket ? Hey , buddy ! Be there in five . Can 't you ever be on time ? Five minutes ... Hurry , Karine 's almost here , Chill . Once my baby 's done freshening up , I 'm there . Fuck ! You 're still at home ? Thomas ? Fuck it . - Hi . - Hi . - Come in . - Thanks . Was it hard to find ? - With an address and a map ? - Right . Make yourself at home . - What 's the plan ? - Thomas is picking us up . If he ever gets here ... Then we 'll get Vincent and go to Elodie 's barbecue . After that , if you want , we 'll all go out to a club . - Want a drink ? - Yes . Vermouth with a green olive , if you have it . Of course ! It 's such a popular request ... - How 's it going ? - Fine . Karine , Thomas . Remember Karine ? For once , a girl likes you . How could I forget ? Thomas . Come here . What 's that ? Are you blind ? Charcoal . - And that ? - Same thing . Shit , Thomas . How could you confuse charcoal with hot dogs ? Hot dogs . Ever heard of them ? Oblong , edible ... I know what a hot dog is , but Vincent was supposed to get them . No . Vincent gets the drinks . Guys , it 's no big deal . There 'll be lots of food . At least we won 't run out of coals ! Idiot . " Won 't run out of coals . " Was he at the party last time ? No . Getting him out of his cave is like pulling teeth . No girlfriend , hard-core gamer . He 's probably still asleep , the loser . Once you get to know him , he 's really cool . Vincent ! Oh , it 's you . It wasn 't locked . Who 's that ? This is a girl , Vincent . Very funny . Karine , Vincent . - Hello . - Hello . Warm welcome ... Ignore the mess , miss . It 's my cleaning lady 's day off . Call me Karine . - Go shower , we 're in a hurry . - I took one last week . That 's enough , Vincent . Move it . Open a window , damn it ! This place smells like a stable ! So what ? You don 't live here . - You okay ? - Don 't worry . I 've got three brothers . I 've seen worse . Don 't touch anything ! You lose ! Coming ! Fed Ex . Mr. Pelletier ? - Package for you . - Thanks . Sign here , please . Thanks . Have a nice day . At last ! Can 't get it in France ! Thanks a lot , guys . I spent all night positioning my armies . I was ready to attack . I would 've creamed him ! - Who ? - The jerk on the 6th floor . Now I can 't go out without getting laughed at ! What else is new ? You ready ? Can we go ? I need a shower . Drinks , Vincent . Shit . Drinks . Read my lips : " Drinks ? Not charcoal ! We look like idiots bringing three bags of charcoal . No way we 'll run out of coals now . What a fan ! Got the whole outfit ? Don 't touch Zidane . That 's a magic number . Oh , that 's classy . Really cool , bud . Guys , the charcoal isn 't going to carry itself . I had no idea you were such gourmets ! Hope your charcoal tastes good ! - Give us a break . - Sorry . - Hello . - How are you ? Come in . Great . What a " gem ! The advantage of a trip like that is you 're alone . And because you 're alone , no hassles . Just a boat , a sail , and ocean everywhere you look . - Still , sailing solo around the world ... - You 'd be alone , right ? - Listen , Tuna - - It 's Tina . Whatever . I think you 're super perceptive . Thanks , Vincent . You 're super too , even if you like to tease . If I were invited on a trip like that , I 'd go in a heartbeat . Sorry to be a drag , lovebirds ... but before you go , there 's one small detail ... Right , Thomas ? - Tell her ! - It 's nothing , really - I don 't have a boat . You 're such a gentleman . I 'll get ready . - Stop pouting . - I 'm not . I 'm warning you : Keep Tuna away from me or I 'm going home . I 'd rather beat off to Lara Croft than get stuck with Tina ! Vincent , be nice for once . Tina 's okay . I 'll be nice , but I hate clingy girls . I 'm warning you , I 'm not riding with her ! You 're such a dork . What 's the hold-up ? Speed up , we 're losing them . I 'm not busting the motor to gain five minutes . Chill . Asshole . We 'll look like losers , again . Can 't stand 30 miles without her ? Should I call an ambulance ? I 'm fine . Stop ragging on me . Give me your cell . Karine gave me her number . I 'll add it to the contacts . Check if it works . Call if you want . She might 've fallen out of the car . Say hello to Tuna , too . So ... is she the one ? It 's dark as hell out there . Can 't see a thing . Who knows ? She 's crazy about music , martial arts ... and hopefully , crazy about me ... We 'd better not break down . If she also likes soccer and she cooks , hang on to her . We 'd be totally screwed . That 's kind of macho , you know ? I 'd like to screw Tina , wouldn 't you ? What ? What did you just say ? I said I 'd like to be home at my computer ... to crush the jerk upstairs , that 's what I said . Got a light ? - Use the lighter . - Doesn 't work . Give me . ... the Minister of the interior declined to comment , . Antoine Cléry is still on the loose after his spectacular prison break ... Psychologically tins table , he killed two guards without hesitation . Major deployments of force are ... News in an hour , now more music . Great . Another psycho on the loose . That makes two . - You scared ? - No , just stating the facts . Really ? Know what they call this road we 're enjoying so much ? - The road ... - Of the White Lady . - What bullshit ! - Who knows ? The locals tell all kinds of stories . Cars disappear . They say there are ghosts . Know what I think ? The White Lady isn 't a ghost . She 's a whore . What the fuck ? She 's a whore who doesn 't want competition ... so she hangs out on a deserted road ! Very funny . Come on , loosen up . Guys ? We 've got a problem . What now ? Nothing serious . We 're out of gas . Don 't tell me you forgot to fill it ! Don 't tell him , Thomas . Shit . Fucking shit ! Thanks , that 's a big help . - What now ? - Turn up the radio , you two can tango . Can 't see a thing in this fog . - Let 's take a look around . - And get lost , too ? Thomas , hold his hand . He 's such an idiot . Turn down the sound . It 's bugging me . Hey , dickheads ! I found a solution . Vincent , pause your game and take the wheel . Yann , get out and help me push . Why should I steer ? I don 't have a license . - Where are we pushing it ? - There 's a fork up ahead ... and then , a gas station . Stop whining , enjoy the fresh air , and push . Come on , push ! It 's clean , fucking spotless . Not a drop of gas , but it 's clean . At least your hands won 't get dirty . We made it , there 's a gas station ! Looks like you two are out of gas . Very funny . Well , it 's not a very inviting spot . So what ? Well , there 's not a breath of wind . How is that normal ? We 'll worry about that later . Put in 25 euros worth . I 'll go pay . Are you nuts ? I nearly shit myself . - Sorry , I didn 't mean to scare you . - Well , you did . You 're alone ? Where 's the manager ? I 've been waiting for an hour and haven 't seen anyone . Besides you . Waiting ? How 'd you get here ? My car broke down on the highway . I hitchhiked and got dropped off here . I 've been waiting . I called highway patrol ... but by the time they get here ... Sorry , we 've got a long way to go . They 'll probably show up soon . Come on , we 'll squeeze you in . I 'm Thomas . Sebastian . Thanks . This is Sebastian . We 'll drop him at the next town . So your car broke down ? ' Yeah , the engine died . 1 don 't know what happened , Thomas , speed up . Let 's join the girls . You know those girls 1 saw pass ? ' They 're these guys ' girlfriends , . Anyway , thanks . Without you , I 'd be stuck there all night . That 's for sure . Cops are never there when you need them , That 's right , Shouldn 't someone be minding the station ? Don 't worry . He 's probably passed out drunk . Anyway , thanks again , . Not a chance . I never lend it . - Why so aggressive ? - As if you knew me . Why 's your buddy so aggressive ? I wasn 't aggressive . So why are you ? Don 't worry . He 's always like that . It 's how he says , " I love you . " That 's why he 's still a virgin . I get it . I 'd rather you didn 't love me . That 's fine with me . - I 'll get you for that . - Chill , I was kidding . What the hell is that ? Holy shit ! Look ! Damn . Is that a chick ? - Vincent , look ! - Take a fucking look ! Drive , damn it ! Fuck ! Maybe that 's your White Lady ! Pick her up . She can sit on this . - She disappeared . - Where the fuck is she ? Up your ass . I 'm so sick of your shit . Look ! The other side ! Fuck ! Yann , Vincent ? I can 't talk . I can 't breathe . - Fucking hurry up ! - Damn handle . Fuck . Holy shit , guys . - Where 'd you get that ? - Seb 's briefcase . What do you think this is , kid , a fucking video game ? Let me out . You hear me , shithead ? Let me out . Let me out of here ! Calm down . What 's happening ? What 's that ? Where 's it coming from ? Fucking shit ! What happened ? What the fuck was that ? Shut up , Vincent ! We gotta get out of here ! Move ! - I can 't move ! - Fucking hurry up ! Hurry , damn it ! Where 's Thomas ? - We gotta get him out ! - I 'm not going back ! Listen up , dickhead . We 're getting our buddy ! Look , Yann ! I saved it . Look . Where 's Thomas ? Where the hell did he fall ? I don 't know . But he 's dead . I don 't know . Oh. honey ! Recognize this , asshole ? Kid , you forgot the safety - Don 't pull that " safety " shit . This isn 't a fucking movie ! Don 't move . Move , asshole ! Step back ! What now , honey ? - Gonna kill me ? - I don 't know . But keep calling me " honey , " and I 'll put a slug in you . Back up , against a tree . Any tree in particular ? Keep joking . Find something to tie him with . You 're gonna pay for Thomas . Tie him with what ? This isn 't Home Depot ! I don 't know ! improvise ! Use his shoelaces . He doesn 't have any ! Stop obeying him like a bitch . Or maybe you are his bitch ? Don 't talk to me , psycho ! Fuck ! Hallelujah ! Christ is among us ! Shut the fuck up ! Shut up ! Stop ! I 'll kill you for that , kid ! Shut up ! Step back . He 's too far up . Climb on my back . Get him down from there . What the fuck are you laughing at ? Don 't hesitate , honey , 'cause I sure won 't . Fuck , he 's covered with blood ! Freeze or I 'll shoot ! Hurry , I can 't take much more ! - Freeze , asshole ! - I can 't get him ! Just try me , fucker ! I beat Outcast in two days . Go on , fucker . I 'll blow you away ! What is this shit ? The thing 's coming back to eat us . What ? The thing that attacked the car . Nothing attacked us . We had an accident . We gotta run . Make a new pal , honey ? Where 's Vincent ? Don 't worry , honey . Why are you here ? In love with me ? No . I thought I might have to finish you off . Don 't touch me , asshole ! You still need us , so don 't fuck with me ! Hey , honey ... if you 're looking for your friends ... it 's that way . It 's Yann . You okay ? Cool ! - Did you call for help ? - No . - What the fuck ? Call ! - You do it . PIN CODE ? Goddamn it . Thanks . My pleasure . We gotta find the damn code . There 's only three billion possibilities ! - I haven 't got an answer . - Try his date of birth . Keep your dumb ideas to yourself ! Eleven , four . Fuck . Doesn 't work . Wow , it doesn 't work . What now ? The length of his dick ? - Looks like a water tower . - If only we had some Scotch ... I 'm going up . From the top there 'll be a better view . You can 't fool me ! It 's a ruse to get away ! Right , kid . Up top , I unfold the wings hidden under my shirt and ﬂy away ? He 's right . If there 's anything around , we can only see it from up there . Where can he go ? Besides , he still needs us . - Go up with him . I can 't . - Are you kidding ? I faint just thinking about climbing on a chair , so up there ... I 'll go alone . Is he okay ? He 's full of holes . How could he be okay ? We gotta find a way to carry him . I 'm exhausted . I don 't have the strength to carry him on my back . Sure , MacGyver . I 'll build a fucking sled . You find the reindeer . Smart-ass . If only ... we had his damn PIN code . Thomas ? We won 't get 1 O feet with this thing . Great . At a time like this , he wants to beat his high score . Thomas , can you hear me ? It 's me , Yann . Listen , we need your code . Can 't you see he 's unconscious ? Think he 's gonna get up and sing his code ? Tell me the code , damn it ! We 're all gonna die here ! Tell me the fucking code ! Finally getting involved ? Finally taking a risk ? Since when have you been interested in anything but yourself ... your shitty games , your shitty computer ? Since I realized I 'm not the only one who 's afraid . What are you doing ? I 'll go get the bastard . Take care of Thomas . You took your time , kid . - I 'd given up hope . - Why ? Miss me ? See anything ? Nothing . - Look . - What is it ? Kid , remember the story about my wings ? It 's true ! We 're gonna ﬂy , you and I. But you go first ! You see anything ? Where 's Vincent ? I 'm talking to you ! Don 't worry , honey . He should land soon . Dream on , honey . Thought you could take me ? Eye for eye , eyebrow for eyebrow . Can you believe it ? There 's what ... hundreds of cars ? I can 't see where they end . We 've no choice . We have to go down there . - And him ? - Fuck him . What the fuck is this ? I don 't know . - You okay ? - We gotta get out of here . We gotta get out of here ! We gotta get Thomas . NO Way ! It 's our fucking car . I can 't understand this shit . Don 't bother . I just want to get out of here ! Check the trunk . Thomas ' soccer-fan stuff . Interested ? A fucking air horn , a scarf ... a ﬂare ... and his shirts ... with the fucking magic numbers ! Magic. my ass ! Nothing else . Ten , 05 ! No fucking way ! - It works ! - Call the cops ! Get us out of here ! - What 's the number ? - 911 . - Lelex station . All our lines are busy ... - it 's a fucking recording ! Fuck . Call the girls . You have Karine 's number , right ? Cool , it 's ringing . Female , long hair , 5 ' 3 " . Recognize her ? Now , honey ... you shouldn 't leave your toys laying around . Come get her . Let 's end this . No ? You don 't want her ? You sure ? Fuck , is it over ? Yes . He won 't bother us again . I meant the earthquake . It 's not an earthquake . - Don 't start with that monster crap ! - It 's not crap , okay ? - We gotta get Thomas . - Oh , yeah ? How ? I 'm not going through that shit again . No fucking way . I 'm not moving . Sit on your ass if you want . I 'm getting my buddy . Vincent ! Yann . This might be a way out . What was that ? Give me the matches . Oh , fuck , what is this place ? We 're in its pantry . Let 's get out of here ! - Nice going - - Shut up and run ! - Fuck - - I know , Yann , " Fucking shit ! " We should 've tried the other way . Listen , Yann ... one more remark like that and I 'll leave you here to rot . Got it ? Thomas ! You 're awake ? Did I miss anything ? No , not much . A few little things . Not that you wanted to abandon me , Yann . It 's more complicated than it seems . I can 't remember anything . Where 's the other guy ? The psycho ? - We left him back there . - He was a bit ... crushed . I don 't understand . Where are we ? What happened ? Listen ... Got anything to drink ? No food , no water . We 've got to keep moving . Dying of thirst under a water tower ... fucking ironic . Quit the philosophy and help me . We 're getting out of here . Ready , Yann ? On three . On three , or one , two , three ? - God , let 's go ! - Forget God , he 's not interested . He lost interest a while ago . One , two , three . Guys , I 'm freezing . I 'm so cold . Is it bad ? I 'm freezing . Hang in there , Thomas . We 'll get you out . The air horn . The air horn ! What ? Fuck , not again ! Noise . It 's attracted to noise . - I 'm waiting ! - Stop ! Stop ! Fuck . We 'll never get out of here . I 'm gonna die up a tree like a fucking squirrel ! Shut up . Stop yelling . What now ? That son of a bitch is attracted to noise . So shut up . What the fuck ? More of your stupid crap ! Figure out how to get us out of here . There 's no fucking way I 'm leaving this tree . That thing is attracted to noise ? - So we keep quiet . - And then ? Then we fucking wait . Wait for what ? A miracle ? For you to have a better idea ? A helicopter ! You hear it ? A helicopter ! We have to signal it ! Sure , but how ? Strip naked and sing " I Will Survive " ? Fuck , the ﬂare . How does it work ? Pull off the fucking cap ! Hurry , Vincent ! Damn it , Vincent , come back ! Vincent . Vincent . Shh ! That thing 's blind , but it 's got good ears . Where are the others ? Thomas didn 't make it . And Yann ... I guess he 's still in his tree . What happened to Yann ? He snapped . Did you see that thing ? Once . In the car graveyard . It attacked us . I was frozen with fear . It passed a foot away without seeing me . The girls screamed . They started running . Tina didn 't have a chance . I don 't know what happened to Elodie . Okay . We know it 's attracted to noise . What else ? - Nothing . - It 's not much . Let 's go find Yann . Yann ! Damn it , Yann ! Oh , fuck . I 'm hearing voices now . I 'm going nuts . Yann ! Vincent ! Vincent , is that you ? No , it 's Tinker Bell . What the fuck kept you ? - Is it serious ? - You joking ? Just a gash and a few broken ribs . Explain later ! We gotta find a way out of here . There 's a sort of gorge over there . Let 's go . Where the fuck does this lead ? Would you mind not saying " fuck " in every sentence ? Is this really the time for etiquette lessons ? Sorry , but I think we 've got bigger problems ... like Vincent who 's pissed off ever since you got me ... like he 'd prefer I were dead . You 've changed , Yann . I don 't think Vincent wants you dead . Sure , he loves me , you love me . We all love each other ! Now that 's settled , can we get moving ? It still works , that 's something . Fuck ! Nothing better to do ? We can 't get out . It 's a dead end . We can 't get out ! What exactly did Karine tell you ? I found a way . It 's not easy , but it 's a way . You 're totally paranoid . Sure . There . It 's our only way out . You 're insane ! Let 's go back . Through the woods we might have a chance . A chance ? With that monster out there ? - Come on , Yann . - Don 't jerk me around ! Think I don 't see through your little game ? You can both fuck off ! Through the hole ? No way ! Stay , then ! If you see our friend the mole , say hi for me . Okay , Karine , let 's go . Stay with me . I didn 't mean it . - I don 't want to die here . - We 'll go together . You and me . Together , we 've got a chance . - What about Vincent ? - You and me , Karine . Let Vincent go alone . You and me . What do you think ? I think I was wrong about you . Go ahead ! Beat it ! Beat it ! I don 't give a fuck ! Come on . Come on , piece of shit ! Come and get me ! Come on ! Let 's end this ! Come on , fucker ! I 'm waiting ! Come on , I 'm waiting ! Wait for me ! Wait ! Fucking wait for me ! - Where 's Yann ? - He preferred to try on his own . The dumb fuck ! We have to get him . Wait for me ! Wait for me ! Wait for me ! Quick ! Vincent ! - Let 's go , Vincent ! It 's over ! - Yann ! Yann is dead ! Let 's go ! Get out of here ! Do you think a train could - In that condition , I doubt it . - Electricity . - What ? There 's electricity . Damn . - What - - Shh ! Listen ! The helicopter 's back ! Over here ! Here we are ! Over here ! They 'll never see us . We 've got to signal . Matches . Find something to burn . - And this ? - Not my cheat codes ! Who cares ! Over there . It worked ! They saw us ! Vincent !

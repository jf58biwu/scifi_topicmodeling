 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Mr. Lattimer . I 'm with the government . You 're to be in South Dakota at noon tomorrow . You 're working for me . - No , no , no . Why are you here ? - I was ordered here . Said it was a matter of ... National security . Arthur Nielsen , you can call me Artie . I 'm thrilled you 're on the team . - What team ? What is this place ? You 're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets . Ms. Bering , Mr. Lattimer , welcome to Warehouse 13 . We take the dangerous and unexplained and lock it away right here . Your job : hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world 's day , snag it , bag it , and tag it . We haven 't met . I 'm Mrs. Frederic . Warehouse 13 ... Is it yours ? - It 's mine . And so are Lattimer and Bering . - Excuse me ? Hello , Laura . - Hello , Mr. Jarvis . You did something different with your hair . I did . I added some color . I like it . Looks good . - Thanks . We 're here . Hey , Kelly . Made the deposit . So , I 'm sorry , but don 't make this my fault , okay ? Okay , okay . Lucky shot , lucky shot . Don 't forget . Who 's your daddy ? That 's right . What ? No , I 'm fine . I 'm not breathing heavy . Chicago again ? That 's ... Oh , come on . No , no , you son of a ... Does corporal punishment work on computers ? I mean , they 're old ! They 're very old , these monitors . They 've been acting up all morning . I found out another robbery in Chicago . I can 't even access ... you know what ? I 'm gonna recycle you both for parts ! How about that ? That 's coming in through ... an external server . Someone just broke right through the firewalls . And reading Warehouse data files ? - No , no , no . Not yet . He 's just fishing , and he won 't break through the ZETAC subsonic security systems . Okay , but , Artie , who would even know about the Warehouse , let alone be able to make it this far ? - Who indeed ? I 'll put a trace on ' em and find out exactly in which pond this scum resides , if we just follow ... He was ready for my trace . He 's very good . I tip my hat to you , sir ! Think we 'll just have to find this guy the old-fashioned way . How are you sleeping ? - I 'm not . I could tell . Your aura looks like hell . Then stop looking at it . You 're dripping on my floor . If you 'll excuse me , I have a date with a forward pass . Where 's Myka ? - She 's outside on her phone . Jeez . I know , I know , mom . Call it a retirement party all you want . We both know dad 's never letting go of about bookstore . Mom , I can 't , okay ? I just ... I have a lot going on right now . Heads up ! - What ? You all right ? - What is it with men and their balls ? Where 's my phone ? Where is my phone ? - It 's at your feet . A third bank was robbed on Friday in Chicago . So what 's going on ? Something strange . I don 't know how the robbers are doing it . So you two are going to Chicago to find out . Chi-town . Chi-town ! Heads up . Does Artie seem a little ... I don 't know , crankier than usual ? How long does it take to find a security tape ? Here you go . - Thank you . Jumpy much ? Okay , I don 't think we 're getting the tape . Bonnie Belski , Chicago , FBI . Agent ... - Bering and Lattimer . What do you guys want with my robberies ? Hi , guys . Nice ties . Can we talk ? We would like access to any evidence , witnesses , or leads you might have . Now that I 'm in your face , you ask nicely . I made a call . A bad shootout in Denver gets you shipped to DC , where , together , you almost lose the president ? Then you get exiled off the reservation into my town , humping my leg . It 's a nice leg . Look , we 're here to help . - I don 't want it . You two have a reputation for leaving disaster in your wake . Your own agency doesn 't know why you 're here . Stay away from my investigation . Enjoy Chicago . Try the pizza . I 'm in love . Projet-SG ( 1.00 ) Agent Belski will be more cooperative now . Yeah ? What did that cost you ? - A couple grand . Director 's a terrible poker player , so I chucked his debt . You never did me that favor . - You never asked . So how you guys doing ? - The warehouse keeps us busy . Doing what , exactly , Pete ? - If I say anything else , Mrs. Frederic will pop out and go all scary-face on me . Give my best to Myka . Stay safe . - Will do . See , this little guilt trip , you 're taking me on ... I don 't do that anymore . Dad won 't miss me . When I was there , he didn 't know I was there . Okay ? So just ... Tell my mother to stop making me do her dirty work . Deenie , I gotta go . Working . Okay , bye . Don 't . - Wasn 't . I mean , it 's none of my business anyway , right ? But , if my dad were alive , I 'd go to see him . So where are we ? Well ... Belski just got spanked . So let 's go strike while the butt is still hot . All right , Mr. Whoever-you-are , trying to get into my computers . You can run through proxy servers in Yinchuan , but you cannot ... hide . Aren 't you arts and crafty ? - You should see my balloon animals . My agents won 't like you destroying their hard work . No , I 'm enhancing it . There 's a big difference between seeing something and seeing something . We know 3 banks have been robbed on 3 successive Fridays at rush hour ... And it is Friday . Six hours to rush hour . By two suspects employing a takeover technique without guns . Banks just hand over the money . Everyone 's shy on the details . Which is strange . Tell me something I don 't know . Mary , Queen of Scots ' croquet mallet was made from a petrified narwhal 's horn . She never lost a match . Do you know how they 're doing this ? Not yet . I 'm rankled . I 'm officially ranked . You had to go and call Dickinson to get access ? Just don 't take it personally . - It 's entirely professional . I 'm just saying you could have come to me and I could have got you whatever information that you need . We needed access , Artie , not information . Let me be clear . I 'm your boss now . You hit a roadblock , you call me , I remove it . Not Daniel Dickinson . Me . All your old contacts are off-limits . No exceptions ! Warehouse security demands it . Understood ? I got it . So can I have your attention now ? - Show it to me . Hold on , freeze . What is inside that one 's coat ? I don 't know . A bomb . Or something scared these people stupid , Artie . Do any of these tapes have sound ? - No , they 're all silent . Why ? - It 's per a federal wiretap law , lest we overhear an account number not party to investigative ... None of the witnesses recall any orders or demands from these robbers ? No , they don 't recall anything . It 's kind of like they have short-term memory loss or something . Lights can do that . They can . Like a strobe can do that . Any kind of flashing ... But nothing 's flashing . I 'm talking about something at the edge of the visual spectrum . Something between the video 's interlaced frames . You know , I had a case once where pollen from a prehistoric plant turned a woman into a sexually rapacious sleepwalker . She was unaware that she was doing that until she pulled the pants off ... Just be quiet . What ? There 's a man on his cell phone during this entire robbery . Do you see that ? - Oh , really ? That 's good . Somebody overheard what was happening in there , right ? An " ear " witness . I need the other side of that call . We have ways . Just get me phone guy 's name . I 'm looking . Just give me a second . I am gonna huff and puff ... and blow your house down . I got him . Me too . So the guy on the phone was leaving a message on his wife 's cell phone . And Artie got his hands on it . - Don 't ask me how . I don 't know . Nice catch . - Thank you . So ... So ... What has agent Belski done for you lately ? She sashays . - Yeah . A little bit . - No . She doesn 't even know it . - Yes , she does . She does . Laura , these are agents Bering and Lattimer . Laura was one of the tellers . - I already told you everything . I don 't remember anything else . I can 't remember anything else . Tell 'em what you told me . It 's okay . Yeah , please , sit down . We just have a couple questions . When the suspects robbed the bank , they played a sound . Do you remember hearing anything ? No , nothing . We have a copy of a recording of a cell phone call that occurred during the robbery . And we 're gonna play it for you , so you just tell us what you think , whatever you can . Ready ? - I guess so . Hey , Kelly . I made the deposit . So if you want to ... Oh , God . God , they 're robbing the ... You should turn it off . Are you gonna play something ? What 's going on ? Nothing . You feel okay ? I feel ... loved . I feel loved . So she had a strong emotional reaction to the sounds on the tape . Yeah , but we weren 't affected . See , what I 'm thinking ... is that this is a limbic trigger . The sound rings a bell in the primal , the lizard part of the brain that connects to the pleasure centers , see ? But we heard it too , and my limbic 's not triggered . It 's not even twitching , so ... I would guess you 'd have to hear it through the robber 's equipment . The bank teller heard it here . - She heard it there for the 2nd time , so clearly , there is a sense memory component . Okay , so what are we looking for ? Are we looking for souped-up speakers or Thomas Edison 's wax cylinder ? Thomas Edison 's what ? Ignore him . Okay , I 'm scrubbing the sound for the melody . All composers leave a chromatic DNA inside their compositions , their music . That 's why The Beatles sound like The Beatles , Copeland sounds like Copeland . - It sounds like my dad 's favorite song . What I 'm doing here is I 'm taking sounds , putting them through a tonal deconstruction algo ... rhythm . Pete , what did you say ? - What ? No , I just ... I said that it sounded like my dad 's favorite song . Center of my soul by The Bricktones , 1960-something . My dad was just nuts for those guys . - Eric Marsden . That 's him . He also wrote ... - Angel 's kiss , A night in my arms . Okay , are you saying that this is one of Marsden 's songs ? Yeah , what , the bank robbery remix ? Give me a second . Give me ... one ... I never heard of Eric Marsden . - That 's ' cause you were too busy dusting off Shakespeare at your Dad 's bookstore . When I was eight , my dad took me to the Blue Note in New York to see Marsden . He was into jazz then , experimental stuff . Same notes . Exactly the same rhythm . I think this is his music . This is his music . Are you sure ? - With a 98.7 probability . I think this is a completely new score . Or it 's a very old composition that 's never been released until now . You 're looking for an original recording of this song . You can start with Marsden . - Where do we find him ? How about 12 miles south of the robberies ? He 's in Chicago . Is he playing somewhere ? - He lives there . 432 ... Argyle street . His music , local crime scenes . I say this guy just hit the top of your suspect chart , so go , go , go . Four hours to rush hour . - You 're driving . And you 're sure about this too ? You found the person hacking into the warehouse ? The network intrusion came from Washington ? With a 90 ... 8.3 probability . Do you have a suspect ? Who 's this ? - Pete and Myka 's ex-boss . Dickinson . - Daniel Dickinson . So the breach came from secret service ? If I 'm right ... and I 'm right ... directly from his office computer . Artie , what are you gonna do ? Stop it . Looks like somebody might have fallen on hard times , huh ? Hard enough to rob banks ? Just hold it right there . Whatever it is you 're selling , I am not interested . We 're with the government . We 'd like to speak with Eric Marsden , please . What for ? Suspicion of bank robbery . You gotta be kidding me . When my voice went , I needed something to do . I backed him up on over 50 records , so I guess this ain 't much different . I 've been his caretaker going on five years now . Does he have any family ? - Ex-wife . She got remarried . She started a new family a long time ago . What about children ? - One kid . Haven 't talked in years . So will he talk to us ? Well , he 's bipolar , clinically depressed and semi-catatonic . Last month , he was diagnosed with liver cancer , but , hey , go for it . How much time does he have left ? Maybe a year . You ask the questions . Not you . Your timber will bug him . And cell phones off , no ringing . And sure hell no vibrating , or he 's gonna start screaming . So get to it . It 's almost lunch . Mr. Marsden ? My name is Myka . This is my friend . We 'd like to ask you ... a few questions . We 're looking into some trouble that we think might be connected with something you wrote . A song , possibly . Sir ? You have a beautiful voice . Someone once told me that I have the voice of a barmaid . He doesn 't hear you . Eric ... is there something you wrote that affects people , makes them ... happy . I mean , I 'm not explaining this very well . Did you see it ? See what ? Everything . Did you write that piece of music , Eric ? I want my grilled cheese now . Eric went from pop to jazz to experimental to just plain weird . You know , he lived in the studio , writing and mixing and playing , thousands of hours of music . He said he was looking for the key . - The key to what ? I don 't know . The human heart . Peace , something . So where 's his music now ? - Stolen . Ask me , that 's what broke him . Stolen how ? - Ever heard of Jeff Canning ? Windy Lake Records ? - That 's him . So what happened ? What always happens when an artist meets a con man . One of them gets rich , and the other one loses an ear . Eric didn 't care about the money . Canning stole his music rights in a terrible deal . Eric was never the same after that . And now Canning is sitting on everything . So if you 're looking for a criminal , talk to Mr. Canning . That it ? And thanks ... for playing the piano . He hasn 't touched it in years , but I always keep it tuned . It 's good to hear it again . I didn 't know you played . - I had a crush on my piano teacher . I used to love going to lessons . - Let 's go see Mr. Canning , shall we ? So was that your dad who said you sounded like a barmaid ? Drop it , Pete . It 's hard to when you 're on the phone every 30 minutes . Okay , look , my family is having a party next week . You satisfied ? The world will survive without you for a day , okay ? Go be with your family . You make it sound so ... cosy . What 's the problem ? You ever see that movie The Great Santini ? With the tough dad and the scared kids . It 's like that , huh ? Yeah , except it wasn 't over in two hours . Windy lake records . This is Stephanie . Todd , hi . The boss was wondering if you 'd mailed his all-access pass this year . Yeah , well , is there any way that we could ... Okay , well , I guess we 'll just wait for your call then . Thanks . So it looks like the boss man fell off the rich and powerful list . You got that from ogling the help ? The offices near the elevator are empty . The magazines are three months old . - Well , money 's tight all over . Except the banks in Chicago are just giving it away , right ? Any idea which one might be next ? - I 'm working on it , but if there 's a link , I 'm not seeing it yet . Hi , I 'm Jeff Canning . Hey , Jeff . Agent Pete Lattimer . - Agent Bering . And what can I do for the government today ? Well , I have a few questions about an artist you represent . I made a lot of deals over the years . Bought and sold libraries , but ultimately , my job is to get the music out there . What about Eric Marsden 's music ? He isn 't selling these days . He 's kind of fallen out of fashion . But I do have an offer on the table to buy his stuff . Course , if you want to better it , it 's yours . Who wants it ? - Anonymous buyer . I suspect it 's a collector in Japan . They love the bubble gum . This is Eric . All his hits , his misfires , work-for-hire stuff . What 's this ? Experimental self-indulgence that will probably never see the light of day . Why is that ? Costs more to market than you could ever get in return . For this , I blame Jed Fissel . Jed Fissel ? - Eric 's engineer . He bought into Eric 's search for a new sound that people needed to hear . New Age crap . They spent way too much of my money looking for it , and most of it sounds like bricks in a blender . Where 's ... So , where 's Fissel now ? Last I heard , he was driving a cab downtown . But that was years go . Look , what 's this all about ? Well , somebody 's robbing banks in Chicago . And we think that something that Marsden wrote might be involved . Anyone can find his stuff in flea markets , resale shops , peer-to-peer networks . No , it 's something unreleased , something the public has never heard until now . Not possible . Everything is right here , and I 've got the only key . Mr. Canning , your lunch date 's here . And I forwarded the phones . Thank you , Stephanie . You can take off . Half days ? It 's no secret the industry 's going through a few changes . Save a penny , earn a penny . The FBI has company . Secret Service is on us now . Why ? - Doesn 't matter . How 's the money ? - Laundered and ready to go . You give the word and everything happens . What 's with the getup ? - We need more . The situation 's changed . - Let 's go . Jed Fissel , Eric Marsden 's recording engineer . Last known address , Fultondale , Alabama . Been off the grid for six months . Dead ? - Unknown . There 's a pattern . We 're missing something that we 're not seeing . Fridays ... Rush hour . - No , besides that . Why these banks , these branches ? And they 're all over the city . FBI . I 've got some pissed off agents who wanna take away your scissor privileges . If I had a nickel . Look , you gave us the sound thing , so I 'm returning the favor . We 're setting up at Midwesterner Bank on Grand . Based on what ? I was going over the rush hour traffic patterns around the other banks . Those streets are jammed , except for a few , specific , not-well-known routes . This bank fits the bill . This crew knows the way in and out of these areas like no one else . Except maybe cab drivers . Ask her about Jed Fissel . The FBI is staking out the Midwesterner on Grand . Belski has a vibe . - Do you ? Then I say they 're wrong . We 're on this . But what if it goes down , and we 're not there ? Fine , go . Play footsie with the FBI . What ? - Leave the Farnsworth . Call me if you get something . Hi , mom . Well , I 'm sorry . He 's canceling it . But don 't make this my fault . It 's okay , I got it . Myka , are you there ? Finally . For crying out ... You know how when you sing in the shower , and it bounces off the tiles , and you sound spectacular ? No , I never sound spectacular . What are you talking about ? The banks are all like that , Artie . They 're all marble and stone . And this music is knocking people sideways because ... it resonates inside the banks . - Like mad . Something in the source material is ... Amplified by the bank 's designs . Okay , I need you to compare all the architecture and interior dimensions of Fidelity Mutual against all the banks in the Chicago area that haven 't been robbed . Yet . - Yes . And Marsden ? Is he still a suspect ? - No , he 's dying of cancer . But his sound engineer , Jed Fissel , the guy who actually made the recording , is unaccounted for . Hold the line , please . Forgot something ? Who the ... What was that ? Kodak moment . The number of un-robbed banks that fit the acoustic profile of the already-robbed banks . Is that what you 're looking for ? It is exactly ... Two . - Two . Great . Where ? It 'll be okay , Stevie . What is it you do , exactly ? Part of the Homeland Security thing ? I can 't tell you what I do , exactly . How does someone get invited to your party ? Well ... You don 't ... You don 't get invited . You get shoved . How long have you and Bering been partners ? Not long . She 's wound pretty tight . Yes , she is . Her history doesn 't bother you ? Denver ? She did her best . The agent who died in the shootout , Sam Martino . There 's scuttlebutt . Apparently , Martino and your partner were having an affair , and he was married . Well , separated , but still . Lattimer . - Myka nailed him . The targeted banks have the same acoustic profile . And I should have figured that out , and I didn 't . Where is she ? Federal agent ! Stop ! What happened ? - Marble , stone and big , high ceilings . That 's what the music needs to work . Wanna ask the recording engineer ? Jed Fissel ... meet the FBI . If you ask nicely , he might give you the other two . Lock it up . I need video . I need tech out here right now . It 's a gray van , no windows , no plates , and the right rear tire is walled . They 're using a record player . Like a close 'n play . So there 's a record . - Possibly in a silver case . I got hit with it . There 's three suspects , including Fissel . One was a woman . You sure ? - Yeah , I ... felt her . You touched her boobies ? Like , that hurts . The hell are you ? - My name ... it doesn 't matter . But I think you know who I represent . Flash Gordon ? You know , I did a lot of work , a lot of research . I traced packets through network systems all over the world , until I finally figured out it 's that computer , your computer right over there that initiated the security breach into my business . Why 'd you do it ? What do you want ? All right , you listen to me . Whoever you are , if you 're gonna kill me or whatever that thing does , do it . But if you 're gonna talk about nonsense , then get the hell out of my office ! I know that you did it . Warehouse 13 ! I got hacked ! Buddy ... you got punk 'd ! I didn 't hack you . Hey , look ... I screwed up , okay ? I 'm sorry you got hit . - Don 't worry about it . Let 's just get Fissel talking , find this record , and go home . All right ? Do you still have those earplugs ? Put ' em in . Watch out ! FBI ! Stop ! Whoever did this mirrored these 12 proxies and ran the breach through here . I didn 't see that . I bet an entire floor of analysts at the NSA would have missed it too . I mean , you traced it this far . The rest should be easy . Let me work it from here . Let ... no . What I need is 30 minutes alone with this terminal . Not possible . Don 't ask . Artie , I need you to find my cell phone . I 'm not your personal cell phone locator , okay ? No , we just lost a suspect . They hit us with the music and took him . Are you okay ? Is Pete okay ? I 'm fine , Pete 's still ... a little affected by the music . He 's making a love connection . - He 's mak ... A what ? Look , I managed to get my cell phone into one of their pockets . Find it and tell us where we need to go . Okay , I 'll get back to you as soon as I can , all right ? So how they doing ? - You know , they 're ... mostly , they 're a pain in my ass . - So am I. I 'm not leaving . This is Warehouse 13 . - This is my office . You wanna use my computer to poke around in your problem ? I 'm staying . Got your 30 minutes . I suggest you not waste it . Could you at least ... avert your eyes , all right ? I mean occasionally . All right , thank you . Don 't you wanna find Myka 's cell phone ? Right , I ... Belski doesn 't seem too bothered by her case kicking her in the ass . Artie 's tracing my phone . What are you ... what are you doing ? I like your perfume . I 'm not wearing perfume . - Whatever you 're wearing , I love it . Stephanie . Canning 's assistant . Hot damn . I found your cell phone . Is it there ? - No . Where 's Jed and Stephanie ? It was never about the money . Where 's the record ? It was never about the money . She missed her father . She had to bring him home . Canning said he had a buyer . - An anonymous buyer . His daughter . Everything fell apart . He couldn 't write anymore . He lost his music . He lost his daughter . There was nothing left for him to hold on to . So he let go . We have to call the FBI . Why ? - Why not ? The bank robberies ? They 're not our problem . That is our problem . Belski will find them . Maybe . But maybe not . I gotta take this . Hi , mom . Can I talk to dad ? You 're putting that back together , right ? You know ... good as new . Okay , Mr. Knock-Knock , we 're gonna open the door and see who you are . You have to stop . Hello ? You 've got to ... Who 's there ? - Make it stop ! You gotta stop her ! - Someone 's there , I can ... What the hell was that ? You okay ? Me ? Sure . You know , just ... a little ... shock .

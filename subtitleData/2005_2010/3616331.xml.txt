 Veridian Dynamics . The environment . Everyone likes it , and so we do too . That 's why we 're committed to saving it . Veridian Dynamics is turning every one of our buildings 100 % green . It 's ridiculously expensive . And spending money makes us sad ... but we 're doing it because we love nature ... even when it 's being mean orjust acting stupid . Veridian Dynamics . Greening our world . I 'm an honest guy , and yet ... I 'm about to lie to 2,000 people . We 're in it now , Ted . Go big or go home . - I can go home ? - That stage is your home . Go . So how did I get here ? Because I like a girl . Specifically , this girl . And like so many stories about a girl ... this one starts with gunplay . Okay , fellas . What are we lookin ' at here ? This is the new unbreakable dinnerware we 've been developing . It 's made from our new polymer , yo . When you talk like that , it just makes you whiter . Whoa ! How much does this weigh ? - Eight pounds , four ounces . - Eight pounds ? - Four ounces . - Guys , I know I asked for an unbreakable dish ... but it doesn 't have to take a bullet . What kind of dinner parties you go to ? Show me a lighter version . - We 've disappointed him . - No one would want to be us right now . And since we are us , it 's very difficult . Agreed . - So where are we on the - - Unbreakable dinnerware ? It 's not really - - Well , then just - - I don 't think we have to go that far . - Good . But make sure - - I will . Veronica and I have worked together so long , we have a shorthand ... an understanding , a trust . Hey , Ted ? So I saw this Veridian commercial last night ... that said they 're greening all of their buildings . Sure . The company does a lot of good things , like - - Greening their buildings ? - There 's one . They also have stopped their logging operations . - Because they ran out of trees . - What do you want , Linda ? I was hoping maybe I could work with the group doing our building . I was reading this stuff about roof gardens . They 're amazing . They can cut air conditioning costs by 30 % . Plus , our roof would look 70 % prettier , so that 's 100 % right there . Please ? Well , the math seems sound . - Let me clear it with Veronica . - Really ? Excellent . Oh , thank you . - Sorry . That was just platonic . - Oh , yeah , I got that . - Because I have a boyfriend . - I know . - Because you weren 't interested in me . - Linda , it wasn 't you . - I just thought - - Why are you even bringing this up ? Just go get me my garden . There is no program to green the building . Yeah , there is . They made a commercial about it . I didn 't say there wasn 't a commercial about greening the building . I said there is no program to green the building . So it 's all a lie ? They prefer to look at it as a dream . But one they 're not working towards . Are you working toward all of your dreams , Ted ? Then stop pointing fingers . How am I gonna tell Linda the one Veridian project she believes in ... is all a big lie ? She sometimes has a problem with what we do here . If we make this , it could kill all the world 's fish . - But boy , does it whiten teeth . - All the world 's fish , or just - Why are we even talking about this ? There she is . I 'm just gonna tell her the truth . - Well ? - You 're in . - Oh ! - Or completely lie to her . - Really ? That 's fantastic . - It 's a dream come true . Oh ! I didn 't see anything . Now , here 's the deal . The rest of the team ... is working on other really good green projects . So you 're gonna do the roof garden ... by yourself . Wow . That 's a lot of work . - So don 't do it . - No , I wanna do it . All right . But you can 't tell anybody what you 're doing . The company has classified this as confidential . But it 's a good thing . Why does it need to be confidential ? Because , uh , if only bad things were confidential ... then every time they labeled something as confidential , people would know it was bad . - That 's weird . - I know . So don 't do it . - I wanna do it . - Good . Welcome to the team . - Which is only you . - Right . Okay , so I lied . But you saw that face . Who wouldn 't lie to that face ? Look at all this stuff ! Yea ! All right , guys . Let 's get it on the roof . Plus , I figure if she 's successful ... I can sell the roof garden as a prototype for all Veridian buildings . Welcome to the big city , fellas . So what 's the deal ? Are you guys fighting or having sex ? I know . One always follows the other . To fund the project , I had to move some money around . I 've never done anything like that before . But people do it all the time , right ? At a company this big , no one ever notices where the money is . Ted , I 've noticed some money 's missing , and I need to know where it is . So do you know where that missing money is , Ted ? Because the company loves its money . The money , it 's - it 's not missing . - Good . Then where is it ? - Well , it 's , um - Uh , it 's been moved ... to ... theJabberwocky project . Jabberwocky ? You know aboutJabberwocky , right ? You 're higher up the chain than I am . - Jabberwocky . - It 's going to revolutionize the way we do business . Don 't tell me you don 't know - Of course I know aboutJabberwocky . It 's gonna revolutionize the way we do business . Well , you obviously know more about it than I do . And I always will . Keep me posted . There 's noJabberwocky project . I don 't normally lie to Veronica . In fact , I never do . But I had to cover the lie I told Linda . Jabberwocky ? What the - Veronica didn 't question me because the worst thing ... that can happen at a company like this is to be out of the loop . If you 're out of the loop , you 're out of a job . - You wanted to see me , Chet ? - There 's some money missing from your department . It 's not missing . It 's been moved to theJabberwocky project . Jabberwocky ? Yes . That 's right . I see . You do know aboutJabberwocky , don 't you ? Of course I do . I just didn 't know that you knew . How could I not know ? It 's in my department . Isn 't it ? Exactly . So we both know what it is . Yes , we do . Don 't we ? Yes , we do . Ted . We now have a plate that weighs less than five ounces . An it 's still unbreakable . Watch . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Fellas , you can 't fire a gun in here . Yeah . Alan ruined that for everybody . But check this out . You were right . That polymer could burst into flames on high impact . You owe me a smoothie . I 'm going to leave this here . Sorry about that , Cathy . But better than that time Alan shot at you , right ? Um , guys , I 'm gonna have to pull the plug on this thing . Wait . What if we could come up with a use for a burning plate ? Aplate you could also cook your food on . - A plate that is also a stove . - A " plove . " Yeah , I don 't think so . Hey , everyone goes through a slump . - Did you hear that ? Now he thinks we 're in a slump . - Oh , God ! My mom 's gonna be so upset . She hates when we disappoint Ted . - You know , you don 't have to tell her everything . - You don 't know her . She gets things out of you . It 's gonna revolutionize the way we do business . Man , I gotta get on this Jabberwocky thing . My wife is pregnant again . I need a winner . - I 'll put in a good word for you . - My God ! You 're on Jabberwocky ? I cleared half my schedule for it . It 's a freakin ' game changer , bro . Just once in my career , I 'd like to change a game . Oh , man . This lie is spreadin like mayonnaise at a Baptist picnic . Ted . This is crazy . I haven 't gotten anything done all day . Everyone just keeps pestering me to get on Jabberwocky . Hey , Veronica , I was just talking to Brett - I can 't hear you . I 'm going through a tunnel . - But - - I 'll call you back . Listen , Veronica . I need to tell you something . Hey , guys . Isn 't this a great day ? I am so happy . I need to tell you that Linda is so happy . Can I borrow him for a second ? And she needs to borrow me for a second . I wish I had the power to make everyone go away . No , wait . I do . - Here . Taste this tea . - Why ? Just taste it . - How do you like it ? - I don 't know . Tastes like tea . - It 's made from urine . - God ! - Uh - - Don 't worry . It 's safe . It 's safe , but it 's also made from urine . You need to work on your flirting . Leary in Engineering gave me this water purification system . And I 've been talking to all sorts of people about things we can do to green the building . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . You 're just supposed to be working on the confidential roof garden . - Don 't take on any more than that . - Why not ? Why not ? Why not ? You remember Alan ? Remember how much he tried to take on ? Think about it . Why aren 't we on Jabberwocky ? We need to be on theJabberwocky project , damn it ! Oh , I thought we decided to go with aggressive . All right . I give up . I gotta tell you the truth . There 's no such thing as Jabberwocky . Don 't give me that crap . Too aggressive . Felt it as soon as it came out . I 'm telling you , it doesn 't exist . - I made it up . - Come on , Ted . When my mom hears you didn 't put us on Jabberwocky , she 's gonna change the locks . Guys , there 's no such thing as-Wait . Your mom knows about it ? Tells her everything , Ted . It 's a sickness . - He 's cutting us out . - Because we failed him . - We need to make him believe in us again . - Agreed . - It 's nice to see you calm . - I hated what I was turning into . jabberwocky was getting out of control . I had to kill it . And the best way to kill a rumor is with another rumor . But I hear it 's not a game changer at all . I hear it 's a game staying-the-samer . Total career killer . People can 't leave it fast enough . So don 't go anywhere near it . I 'm only telling you this because I like you . Unfortunately , Jabberwocky had gotten too big . It was like trying to kill a bear with a chopstick . I 'm not saying it can 't be done . It 's just super-duper hard . And so we 're looking for a way to make Ted feel good about us again . - Any ideas ? - I don 't know . Buy him a candle . That 's not gonna fly . Ted hates things that light on fire . - Hey , Ted likes Linda . - You wanna give him Linda ? I mean , I wasn 't thinking that , but - I will be given to no man ! I saw that in a movie once . Nothin ' . What if we just help her with whatever project she 's working on ? Yeah . Ted might appreciate us doing that . - Say , Linda , what are you working on ? - Oh , you 're talking to me again . Well , I 'm not supposed to tell anyone . But I could use some help . I 'm building a roof garden ... and I need a super energy efficient way to light it at night . - Have you considered a plove ? - Oh , forget the plove . What about bioluminescence ? Fireflies have been using it for 200 million years . - Fireflies - the flaming plates of the insect world . - Mmm ! - Hi , Veronica . - Hello , Linda . Thank you . You don 't have to thank me every time I say hello . But ... it 's nice to hear . Okay . Do it . No . I mean , I love this project . I know I 'm not supposed to say anything , but I really appreciate it . - So you 're working on it too ? - Day and night . I see . Then tell me , Linda , how 's it going ? Specifically . Tell me anything . Even the littlest thing would be great to hear . Well , the worms are thriving . And I got Ted to drink urine . Veronica ? Hi , Ted . Just trying to get to know you better . By going through my files ? You 're such a closed book . Okay . I don 't know whatJabberwocky is . It 's the company 's most exciting project , and all I know ... is that it involves worms and urine . Veronica . There is noJabberwocky . - What ? - I made the whole thing up . You lied to me ? I know . It was wrong . I needed to move some money around so Linda could build her roof garden . A roof garden ? Oh , for God 's sakes , Ted . Why don 't you just do her already ? Do you know what kind of trouble we 're in now ? This is all they 're talking about upstairs . In a couple of hours , we 're presenting Jabberwocky to the entire division . What ? Why 'd you agree to that ? Oh , really , Ted ? Is that your strategy ? - " Let 's make this Veronica 's fault " ? - You 're the only person I told . Wow . It is your strategy . That is so thin . All right , let 's not panic . Why don 't we tell them thatJabberwocky is Linda 's greening the building project ? Because they don 't care about greening the building . It 's not gonna happen . Well , how am I gonna tell that to Linda ? Why don 't you start like this ? " Hey , Linda , can I borrow some money ? 'Cause I just lost my job . " You 're right . Why are we even talking about Linda ? We have to focus on this presentation . We need to come up with a product that no one has ever seen before . It better be good . They 've already signed a contract with James EarlJones ... to be the voice of - Jabberwocky . So , here we go again . Because of a girl , I 'm about to lie to 2,000 people . We 're in it now , Ted . Go big or go home . - I can go home ? - That stage is your home . Go . Business is changing - changing at the speed of information . Whoever adapts first - Wins . In order to compete , we innovate . In order to innovate , we redefine . And how do we redefine ? With a new definition . jabberwocky . Jabberwocky . Jabberwocky . - This is going great . - Think how great it would be if we 'd come up with a product . Products are for people who don 't have presentations . Imagine a new way to do business ... that 's faster than a cheetah . More powerful than ... another cheetah . I only had an hour to pull stuff off the Internet . A way of doing business ... more magnificent than ... a fish . Or a whale ! Jabberwocky . Jabberwocky . jabberwocky . Jabberwocky . Sure , there were a few hiccups . But not having a product wasn 't slowing us down at all . So what is it ? What is it exactly ... that 's gonna revolutionize the way we do business ? Simple . It 's - jabberwocky . The game is changing right now . Coming in 2012 . So do you understand whatJabberwocky is exactly ? - Of course I do , you idiot . Don 't you ? - Yeah . I was just seeing if you needed me to explain it to you . I love being applauded . If I had a tape of that ... I 'd fall asleep to it every night . It was a great evening . Although I 'm still angry about the flash pot . - That would 've looked so cool . - Ted , don 't ever lie to me again . I 'm sorry . I won 't . Too many people get hurt . And the next thing you know , you 're buying James EarlJones an " I 'm sorry " muffin basket . And you 're not a very good liar anyway . But that 's okay . Neither am I. Now that 's how it 's done . There are a lot ofbad things about lying . But the worst thing is when you have to tell the truth . So this project never existed ? Then this whole thing was pointless ? No , it wasn 't . Look around . Look how beautiful this is . You did this . I mean , you made a difference right on this rooftop . Hope you 're not upset . Nah . You stole from the company for me . How could a girl be mad at someone that does that ? You 're like my thief in shining armor . If we 're gonna hug , you 're starting it . - Good evening , Ted . Linda . - Ted . Linda . - Ted - - Linda . I was past the greeting . Ted - Don 't . We were working with Linda on this very important project ... and we are about to light up this rooftop without using a single watt of electricity . - Impossible , you say ? - I didn 't say anything . It 's not ! Behold the power of bioluminescence . Oh , guys ! - It 's so pretty . - We took the plants 'D.N. A ... and spliced in the bioluminescent properties of fireflies . We call them " fire flowers . " Nice work , fellas . I 'm impressed . - Really ? - Yeah . In fact , I think the company might be interested in something like this . - We 're back . - And we 're proud . What was that ? Uh , fire squirrel . A week later ... we found another benefit of Linda 's roof garden . Although the fire squirrel turned out to be a mistake ... driven mad by not being able to sleep due to its constant glowing . As for theJabberwocky project ... we never did have to figure out what the hell it was . Because after our presentation , the company was so excited ... they fast-tracked it and shipped it toJapan . Jabberwocky . What they shipped , I 'm still trying to figure out . And so are thejapanese . English - US - SDH

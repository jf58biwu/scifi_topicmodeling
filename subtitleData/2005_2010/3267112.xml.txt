Don 't you talk about katie.She 's my wife . You guys say you 're going through some sort of family crisis . I 'm supposed to trust you ? Well , you 've given me no reason to . When I 'm ready to talk about this , I will . But I 'm not ready to tell you , and jack , you 're not ready to hear it . I told him to back off . And that 's gonna do it ? The card thing 's temporary . Once he figures out there 's nothing wrong , then ... he wont back off , dan.I know him . I 'm fine keeping jack at a distance.I prefer it . He 's concerned .

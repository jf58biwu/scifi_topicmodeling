 I 'll tell you what . You find Patient Zero , - I 'll find a way to get the drugs to Africa . - You got a deal . - Where is she now ? - She 's dead . It 's a sick fucking disease . Ruby ate all that infected chicken ... We need answers ... please . Look , you 've got to exhume that body . We need a sample of the brain tissue . What we should do , is ... We should ... Do you know what 's it 's like to lose a child ? I know if I lost my son , I 'd hardly be able to breathe . - You 're not divorced . - No . I did not deceive Nicole by enjoying an evening with you . No . You deceived me . What ? Your father 's a fucking genius . Logically we assume that there is no logic ... We try every drug . - That 's crazy . - Thank you . He had a stroke . Never woke up again . He had a stroke ? Oh , Bob , what are you doing here ? - He 's so young . - Bob , meet Glenn . Hi , Glenn . You should think about the future . Now Richard has one . Hello . Thank you for coming this evening . The impact of the South Asian haze can be defined as follow . - Bob . - Follows . Spatial and temporal mean solar energy is reduced by as much as 14 megawatts to the negative power of 2 . - Bob . - What ? Eyes , Bob.Eyes ? Look out . Out here . You gotta make eye contact , Bob . Establish trust . - Speak to me . - But I have to look at my notes . Remember ? You said so , " Write it all down . " Yes . I did say that . I also said " Refer to your notes " . Not attach yourself to them like some kind of mollusk . - Yeah . - Taxi . Be right down . So look at me , OK ? Or anybody . Somebody . You 're going to be speaking to a room full of your peers , Bob , - so own the room . - Okay . This is a very incredible thing you 've done . The impact of the South Asian Haze can be defined as follows ... Oh , sorry . The cloud estimated to be 3 km thick , is responsible for hundreds of thousands - of deaths of severe respiratory disease . - Slower , Bob . Asia 's Brown haze is altering the weather , creating acid rain . The dangerous haze lies over the entire Indian Subcontinent , - from Sri Lanka to Afghanistan ... - Better . Oddly it has sparked flooding in Bangladesh , Nepal and- - - Look up . - I am . - You 're not . - I 'm gonna be car sick . - Bob ! - I can 't do this . Sure , you can . I 'm hungry . I need a shower . - I need to talk to Caroline . - What ? Why ? I 'm nervous . Nervous is good . It 's charming . I 'm not - - what did you say - - " modulating " my voice ? We talked about this , Bob . They 're gonna have a microphone for you on the podium . Sure . That will be good . Something to hold on to . And I 'll be right there for you . You will ? Yeah ! Hand-to-heart , front row . So if you even start feeling the slightest bit , you know , uncertain , you just look out for my smiling face . OK ? I can 't do this . Yes you can , Bob . Come on , Bob . Come on , Bob . Please ... Let 's go , time is money . Thanks . 2.04 Dim Dimmer Carlos ? Carlos . - Hi . Do you have a sec ? - Uh , I was just about to- - Great . Listen ... Hum I- - Well , for the last six months , I 've been conducting a study for the Diabetes Society . Attempting to differentiate and stabilize pancreatic cells in culture ... Yes , that 's right . Insulin producing cells . And ... I think I 've done it . Insulin producing cells in the pancreas . Jill , you 're talking about a cure for juvenile diabetes . I know . But I said I " think " . - You think ? - Yeah . I mean ... The protocols need to be- - - Of course . - Looked at . You know , again . - Naturally . - You know ... I 've checked them . I have checked them ... I 've rechecked them , - and triple checked them . - Yes . It 's time to publish ! You put this in Science or Nature or- - - No , no . Not yet . - Of course " yet . " No . I haven 't even told David . And ... Before this goes out to anyone , I really need to make sure that it 's sound . - Yes ... - Will you help me ? Of course I 'll help you , Jill . We will go check everything . Come on ! The House of Poe . There should be one not too far from here . We have 3 hours before the conference . That should give us enough time . - Eat your breakfast . - There was a cottage in the Bronx and a farm on the Upper West Side . Gimme that . - And a house on West 3rd . - You can 't eat it like this . Of course it was called Amity Street when he- - What did you say ? I said , you can 't eat it just like that , you got to put stuff on it - and grow hair on your chest ! - Oh . Poe is a genius , ahead of his time . To this day I can still quote The Raven . Or perhaps I should I say : " quoth " ? Perhaps you should shut the fuck up and eat your breakfast or we 're not going- - Hey ! Come on Bob ! Oh ! Shit ! - Maybe it 's for the best . - For the best , Bob ? - Well ... - My cell phone , passport , ticket home , your slide presentation . Maybe we should go back . How could he just disappear like that ? We passed a subway entrance half a block back . No , no , I had him in my sights the whole time . - There ! There ! - Where ? Come on Bob ! David , stop ! You don 't know what 's in there . Fuck it . Nice ... You 're paying for the shirt , asshole . So you 're staying in Toronto a few more days ? Yeah , yeah . I got a couple of colleagues in from Germany that I haven 't seen for years . Thanks man . Thought I 'd catch up with them while they 're in town . Then , back to London . Right . Yes . Yep . But ... But I 'll probably be back . You know ? You don 't want me here . I do . I do . But you have a wife and having you here would just force me to do things beyond my control . I wouldn 't want to resent you for driving me to those places . You know ? So ... I think ... the best thing you can do for me ... is to stay far , far away . That sucks a great deal . Here I 'll go down on you ... With ! With ... uh ... Go down with you . Hey ! I 'm not quite sure how to say this , so I 'm just ... I 'm just going to say it . What ? I think you 've found the cure to juvenile diabetes . I think that 's the nicest thing anybody 's ever said to me . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! And there 's no doubt in your mind ? Jill , you proved you could generate 95 % of insulin producing cells . Ninety-five percent , Jill ! I know . I know . I know . But there 's still so many questions . I mean , how stable are the cells ? How much insulin are they producing ? Further study is needed . But the evidence is clear , at least , to me . Okay . And you don 't think ... Think what ? Think what ? That in my eagerness to get results , I mean the results that I wanted- - I have seen all your work , okay . You took your time . I personally would have no problem putting my name to this . Really ? You 're going to win the Nobel Prize for this , Jill . I 'm going to win the Nobel Prize ! I have to call somebody . I have to ... Who do I call ? - Your mother ? - No . - My mother ? - Ha ! Ha ! No , no . Wait , wait , wait . Yeah ? Hello ? - Yeah ? - Who is this ? Who are you looking for ? I 'm sorry , I must have the wrong number . Yeah , you must . Wait . - David ? - Hmm-hmm . What ? - It 's the same guy . - Is this you again ? Who am I speaking to please ? Who are you speaking to ? Uh ... The party to which you 're connected to , bitch . O h ... Look ... Hello ? Hey , kid ! I 'll stay all day , if I have to . What the fuck am I doing down here ? Playing hero ? Yeah , good science cop , that 's me . Well , either David 's lost his cell phone or he 's finally hitting puberty . Do you think we need to be worried ? For David ? He 'll be fine . You 're right . - You trying him again ? - No . No ... Diabetes Society . The Guy who 's funding me is under a lot of pressure to get results . Hello Norm . Hi . It 's Jill Langston , calling . Well , I may have some good news for you . The most direct effect is a significant radiation in the solar reduction reaching the ... The most direct effect is a significant reduction in the solar radiation reaching the Earth 's sur ... face . I can help you with your homework . Oh . It 's not homework . It 's a report . - About what ? - The Asian Brown Cloud . She works at Maxie 's on 27th ? Huh ? - She 's a stripper , right ? - Stripper ? No . No , she 's a ... It 's a massive cloud of air pollution that threatens 60 % of the world 's population . No shit . Oh , completely . It significantly reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth 's surface . You mean sunlight ? Sure . Then there 's the increased danger of thermal inversion . Uh-huh . Would you like to hear about thermal inversion ? Hell yeah . Okay . Hit me . Good afternoon . Thank you for coming . The impact of the South Asian Haze can be defined as follows . Spatial and temporal mean solar energy is reduced by as much as 14 megawatts to the negative power of 2 . Two independent model studies that the ... You really think it 's safe to be down here ? Well , I 'm a Canadian . We tend to give people the benefit of the doubt . - Big mistake . - I want my bag back , kid . You David Sandstrom ? Okay . Who are you ? Hey ! Hey ! You want your bag back or what ? Owen . He don 't belong down here . Don 't worry about it . He 's with me . You better not go tellin nobody we 're down here . I wouldn 't think about it . Look , he 's a doctor . I need him . He 's not welcome down here . Yeah . It 's cool man . Come on . Look , kid , just give me my shit back , okay . I 'm not gonna call the cops . How 'd you know I was a doctor ? Oh . Right . So what are you ? Fifteen ? Sixteen ? Fuck you . Fifteen ! This is a cozy place you got here . How many people you got squatting down here , anyway ? You know what , just give me back my stuff and I 'll go . Fuck . - What ? - Celine Dion . Coldplay . Bjork . Chick pod . What 's wrong with Bjork ? I will pay you for the fucking bag , okay . Name your price . - I don 't want your money . - What do you want then ? She 's sick . Sick ? Oh , shit . You ... You think I 'm a doctor doctor , right ? That 's what it says on your dog tags . Ph.D. , not M.D. I don 't run around with a stethoscope and an insurance form . I 'm a molecular biologist , kid . Have you tried taking her to a clinic ? Yeah , free clinic . Walk-in place for people with no insurance . - Must have been a long line . - Yup . Around the block and by the time they got to her she couldn 't stand on her own two feet . They took her for a junkie and then they washed their hands of her . - Just like you . - Hey . You 're missing the point . You telling me that you haven 't had any medical training ? That in your line of work , you can 't tell what 's making somebody sick ? Okay . - Okay , what ? - Okay . Sunshine and me ... we survived down here together . It 's okay . We need each other . It 's okay . It 's okay . You really need to get her out of here into a hospital have her checked out . I already told you . She 's been checked out . I mean , They said there was nothing they could do . I mean ... Read her file . Do you see anything wrong with her ? Just do me a favor and read it . No . Sunshine , stop . Sunshine . Sunshine , no . No , no , no , no . - Don 't bite yourself . - Okay . Alright . Just have to take a look at something here . It 's okay . It 's okay ... Dude , she doesn 't shoot . Well , her file says there were traces of cocaine and methedrine in her blood . So ... Yeah , well she doesn 't shoot . I mean , she might take a toke , or whatever , but just recreational . - Hey , hey , hey ! - How long 's she been like this ? A couple of weeks ago , she started feeling bad . And then she started getting dizzy and she lost her appetite . Is she getting any fluids ? She 's getting them but she 's not keeping them down . Sunshine , you gotta stop . - She 's doing this a lot , eh ? - With her shoulders ? Yeah . Sunshine , my name is David . Can you hear me ? Hurts ... Hurts ? Where does it hurt , Sunshine , where 's the pain ? Get it out ... - Get it out of me ! - No . No . - Get it out of me ! - No . Sunshine ... Sunshine . You gotta stop , okay . You gotta stop . That 's it , we 're taking her up . - Up ? - Up . Up . As in , up . Look , the 's nothing in her blood , there 's nothing in her file . Her white cells are okay , there 's no infection ... - Then what the hell is wrong with her ? - I don 't know . - Maybe it 's in her head . - Dude , she 's not fucking crazy , okay . Look , drugs , malnutrition . She needs to see a fucking doctor . I already told you , she 's been to see a doctor . Fuck this shit , we 're taking her to a hospital . - No . A fucking mental hospital ? - Gimme my phone . Okay ? I 'll make some calls . I 'll get her in somewhere . My phone ? Look , I didn 't take anything . Oh . I appreciate that . Come on , let 's get her up . Hey , hey . I got it . Okay , Sunshine . Come on . We got to get up now . We got to get up . Come on . Okay ? It even affects the size of raindrops . How 's that ? It 's complicated . Did that hurt ? I 'm thinking about getting a tattoo . But I heard it really hurts . It 's not so bad . I mean , it depends where you get it . - Like I have one right here ... - Yeah ? And that one hurt really bad . David ! What happened ? - Bob , I 'm surprised at you . - Why ? Oh . No . This is Sandy . We were talking about the Asian Brown Cloud and tattoos . - Of course you were , Bob . - You got the bag ! - Are the slides in there ? - I got everything , Bob . Plus a little extra . Oh . - Honey , you don 't look so good . - David ? - I 'll explain on the way . - On the way ? - Where do we get a cab around here ? - Oh , I can help you out . I have a way with cab drivers . Yeah , get me the number for Bellevue . So what were you guys doing down there ? They live down there , Bob . Really , I heard about that once . But I thought it was an urban legend . - Do I look like an urban legend ? - No . You get a free ride wherever you want to go . Oh , great . Great . - Thanks for listening . - Sure . " Asian Brown Cloud . " It 's a good name . - Good luck , Bob . - Bye . So ... What 's a psychological profile ? It 's all good . It means they 'll watch her . Give her medication for anxiety , depression , whatever they think is going on . Yeah , but I don 't want them to mess with her head . Owen , listen to me . She 's in a good place . That 's what you want , right . - Yeah . - Then don 't do this . Let the doctors check her out and see what 's in her head . - What if they send her back ? - What do you mean ? She ran away a year ago . And her parents , she 's been talkin ' to them . - They want her to come home . - That wouldn 't be so bad , would it ? - Dude , she hates them . - Why , are they abusive ? No . They just . They freak her out . I 'm old enough to be your dad , right ? - Do I freak you out ? - No , you 've been all right . Well , I got a daughter about your age and I totally freak her out , don 't I , Bob ? Totally . - Where is she ? - She lives in B.C. with her mom . Who , by the way , freaks her out even more than me . You see ? It 's what parents do , man , it 's part of the job description . Can I buy you a cab ride home ? No . I 'm going to go see how Sunshine 's doing . Alright . Well , go buy her a magazine or some candy or something . Thanks . Really . Thanks man . Sure . - We got to go . - Yeah . I 've already missed 2 lectures , David . Where are we ? I really don 't want to miss one this afternoon . I 've got to go back to the hotel and take a shower . How sure are you ? David . Hi . What 's going on ? I tried calling you . Yeah , yeah . That 's a long story . Look , you really think you 've got it ? Well , there 's still some work to be done but ... - How soon can you get down here ? - You want me to fly to New York ? Yeah , you can get down here in what , probably a few hours right ? I 've got to see that data . I mean ... A cure for Diabetes can 't wait till I get back . And over this period , I measured a 2 to 3 % drop in sunlight , worldwide . Rates vary , and exact measurements are difficult due to calibration problems with the instruments and a correspondent problem of spatial coverage . Experiments in the Maldives in the 1990s showed that the effect of macroscopic pollutants in the atmosphere at that time , blown south from India , caused about a 10 % reduction in sunlight reaching the surface in the area under the pollution cloud . A much greater reduction than was expected . She 's good . - You 're amazing . - Stop it . No , I 'm serious . Parker Norberg in Geneva , and the " Alberta Boys " up in Edmonton . They 've been trying to produce stable , insulin-producing cells for years , and you did it . You did it . And combining elements from two different stem cell lines ... It 's fucking brilliant , Jill . Take me through it . Ah , well , I was able to develop cells from Line A into pancreatic beta cells . But we couldn 't get them to stabilize , let alone grow . So ... we found Line B , which produced a factor that , when added to Line A , not only stabilized the beta cells , but stimulated insulin production . Uh ... Fit tab B into slot A. - So it would seem . - So the question is , what 's in the supernatant of Line B that 's inducing Line A cells to grow ? - That is the question , yes . - And you will find the answer . We got to celebrate . Champagne ? David ... - What ? - Well ... You and me in a hotel room . Champagne . A fucking cure for diabetes . Yeah a fucking cure for diabetes . - Where did you get them ? - Them ? - The stem cells . - Ah , the stem cells . Line A 's from San Francisco . It was one of the few that Bush sanctioned . - Line B ? - Korea . Not sanctioned . - By the U.S. - Right . Fuck em . We 're not doing work in the U.S. - David ... - No . All I want you to worry about right now is figuring out what makes it tick . Okay ? - Okay . - And whatever you do , don 't mention this to the Diabetes Society . Right ? Right . Because the last thing you need right now is a press conference screaming " Miracle Cure for Diabetes ! " But what you do deserve , is a toast . A small toast of Champagne to celebrate the single most amazing and incredible thing you have ever done . Wow . Okay , one drink and I 'm out of here . Has this happened before ? Before I had hil transferred from Boston . No ! No one at your facility ever told me Glenn had a lung infection . I don 't care how common of a problem it is . I 'm his legal guardian . It would have made sense to call me and tell me about his condition . No , I did not sign a do not resuscitate form . No , you don 't have to check his file . Just get me Dr. Bennett . - Doctor ... - Doctor ... Bob ! - Shit . For real ? - Hey Bob ! I 'm up . I 'm up . I 'll be right there . Shirt ! Yeah . No , no . I 'm up . I 'm up . Just ... Oh ... Oh . What are you doing here ? - Can I come in ? - You 're , uh ... in . How did you find me ? I looked through your stuff . Hotel receipt . - What 's going on ? - Uh . It 's not mental . Are you ... Has the doctor checked her out ? No , no. listen ... Billy . He 's got it too . - Billy ? - Down in the tunnels . He doesn 't do drugs or nothing . And he 's got it , like the exact same thing . Look , Owen , I don 't know what to tell you , man . You were wrong . You said it was because she was crazy . No . I said she was ... I said that her blood work didn 't show any signs of infection and that her vital signs were all- - Look . The point is that you can 't catch craziness from someone else . I wouldn 't be too sure about that . Hello . This is Jill . My ... - ... associate . - How do you do ? Hi . - What 's going on ? - Hmm . Can we just go see Billy ? Morning , Bob . Hi Jill . What are you doing ? - What 's going on ? - That 's a good question . Oh well , okay . I 'll come back later . - No , Bob , what is it ? - It 's okay . Come in , Bob . Come in . Come in . Could you please go get a cab ? And could you please , go with her , and I 'll be right there , I promise . Yes . Let 's do that . - Hi Bob . Bye David . - Bye Jill . - What 's going on , Bob ? - I 'm meeting Heather . She 's incredible . She 's right there with me on global warming . We 're having breakfast . I think we can work together . I 'm nervous . You got a date ! No , no , no . That 's okay , okay ? Okay . Okay , so you want to just take things nice and slowly . Right ? You don 't want her to know you 're coming on to her . But I am . Aren 't I ? You 've got to relax , Bob . You 've got to relax . You want to call Caroline ? - I already have . - All right , well , look . You just asked her out for breakfast . Just sit back and enjoy your meal together , okay ? See where it goes from there . Do you think she likes oatmeal ? - Gimme a break , Bob . - Here she is . Okay . Remember , it 's just like giving a talk , right ? Confidence , eye contact , humour . Ha , ha . You 'll do just fine . I 'll see you in a little bit . Okay ? - Dr. Melnikov . - Bob . - It 's a pleasure . Heather Michelle . - I know . Ha ! Thank you . - I was very flattered by your note . - Oh , likewise . I mean , I was flattered by your talk . I mean , not flattered , but impressed . Well , thank you . Yeah . You know , I 'm working on an inversion theory , and I think I heard something in your presentation that is directly connected to something in my work . Well , I 'd love to hear it . Do you like oatmeal ? It 's my favorite . Could be neurological . Billy , do you get a lot of mosquitoes down here ? Shit . It 's the same as Sunshine . - It started the same way . - It 's not West Nile . It 's almost epileptic . We should get some blood work done on him . Listen ... It 's the same as Sunshine started and it 's not in the blood , and it 's not in the fucking brain . Hey Owen ... Relax . We 're here to help . - What 's your chart saying ? - I don 't see anything . Looks like they did all the right tests . HIV . TB . Immunoglobulin M and G antibodies . - Okay . So I went to brain damage . - It makes sense . But this guy isn 't as bad off as the girl . - Owen , how long has Billy been down here ? - He 's new . Couple of weeks . - And Sunshine ? - I don 't know , a year . Why ? Yeah , what are you thinking ? Just thinking . We can put Billy and Sunshine under a microscope . Check their DNA , see if they got anything in common . 40 year old male , 15 year old female , that 's a long shot . What else do you think they might have in common ? They both live in this shithole . Sorry . Environment . We going to need to collect things , Owen , okay ? Air , water , wall scrapings , rat shit , whatever 's down here we need a piece of it . - You got any baggies ? - Yeah . Okay . And Owen , I need blood and urine samples from Billy to compare with Sunshine . - How are you going to take the blood ? - Oh , shit . - I can get a needle . - A clean one ? Yeah . - What ? - You 're amazing . What ? Look where we are , David . This is the actual asshole of New York City . Yeah , I couldn 't get tickets to The Lion King , so ... So where do we start ? Hmm ! Maybe with something about last night ? What is there to say ? Uh ... Something .. - Okay , here 's the thing ... - Right . When you came down to New York , I never thought for a second but ... I see you found the baggies . Let 's get to work . - I 'll get , ahem ... - I 'll go this way . How does solar heating in the haze affect the monsoon rainfall ? How does the reduction of solar energy to the surface - affect the water table ? - Right . Does the haze amplify or ameliorate the warming due to the greenhouse gases ? What if we started a working group ? You and me ? Yeah . I 'd love to come and see this weather tank you 're building . I mean , who knows , maybe there 's a way that I can use it in my work . If that 's not too much of an imposition . Not at all . I wish we would have met at last year 's conference . Ten years ago , when global warming first surfaced to the Earth as a threat to our environment . - We can 't ignore the politics of this . - Of course not . No , we 've got to push for legislation , and get the fat cats to realize that this problem is ... Ha ! Oh my ... We 're running late for the morning sessions . The time just flew . Bob , this is the start of something . I know it , I feel it . That 's the great thing about these conferences , isn 't it ? What 's that ? We might never have met otherwise . Heather ! Yeah ? You 'll be at my talk this afternoon ? Are you kidding ? I wouldn 't miss it for the world ! Boo ! Scared the shit out of you , didn 't I ? - How did you do ? - Well , we got a dead rat . Green slime and some sulfuric water . - Ah . - So what happens now ? Well , now we take these and run them through some very powerful , very expensive equipment in a lab in Toronto . Gotcha . So what 're you shooting ? Me ? Nothing . Where did you get the needle ? See , I knew you were going to front on me for that . - You gotta stop . - I already have . Owen , what are you doing down here , man ? Well , seeing as how I live here , I guess it 's home . You don 't have any other place you could go , like back home ... home ? North Platte , Nebraska ? My dad drives a truck , he 's never home . And my mom 's ... She 's found the Lord ... And so it 's just better not being around . Does she know you 're here ? - She doesn 't care . - How do you know ? Because every time I go to the bus station , I see the posters of all the missing kids and runaways of parents who want to find them . I look and I don 't see me . See . She probably doesn 't even know I 'm gone . So this is home ... my home . You got a cell ? Come on . That 's my number . Call me in a week , I 'll let you know what we find . Or ... You know ... if you need anything . But not collect ! - Bye Owen . - Bye . His EEG was almost flat ? Oh , my God ... Why wasn 't I told , Doctor ? Right . No . He 's ... he 's doing fine . It sounds like the same trouble he 's had in the past . So ... Yes . I will . Yes . Thank you . Hey . It 's me . Uh ... I 'm , uh ... Just ... uh ... Call me when you can . Okay ? Bye . Ah . You think he 'll be okay ? I don 't know . Well ... Where should I start with this stuff ? Have Carlos do the blood . Check everything with Sunshine 's file . Get Mayko on a computer run for symptoms . See if she can find anything even remotely close , and ... You know the rest of the drill . Sure . Taxi ! Nice . - Thank you . - We 'll talk . - Okay . Talk . Fuck ! Bob ! What ? Oh . Am I coming ? Yes ! Bob Melnikov . Good afte ... Good afternoon . Thank you all for coming . I promise you an interesting talk even though it might be full of hot air . Well . So much for starting off with a joke . 60 % of the world 's population lives in Asia . - Okay , so ... Hang on a second . - What are you doing ? What ? For the ... No . Never mind . Okay , we 'll be back tonight . - Okay . Okay . - Thanks , Jill . Over the past three decades large-scale economic developments have transformed Asia , not only on the ground , but in the skies as well . A large , brownish haze now covers much of this part of the world , posing a threat not only to Asia and her people , but to the entire planet . Thank you and enjoy the rest of the conference . He works at my lab , you know . Bob , we are gonna send you out on the road . Come on , David . Serious , you 're gonna be a big star . - Heather , am I right ? - I can 't deny it . Who needs another drink ? Gentlemen , I would love to , but I have dinner plans . - Ah ! - And a show . A show ? What better show could you possibly get than this one right here ? It 's tempting ... - So , Heather ... - Yeah ? When do you think you 'll be able to come and visit ? - Well , just as soon as- - - Hi ! Oh , hey . Cass Wilcott . - This is David Sandstrom . - Sandstorm ? Sure thing . - Oh you 're Bob Melnikov . - Hi ! I loved your talk . So inspiring . Thanks . Well , what brings you to the conference ? Her . - Hum . Bob . - I 'm her partner . Oh ! So you 're working on the global dimming project together ? Ah ! No . It 's a common mistake . Cass is my partner ... Partner . Oh ! - Oh , Bob , I 'll be in touch . - Okay . - Nice to meet you . - You 've got my card , right ? Right ! Bye David ! Heather . I can 't believe I didn 't notice . I usually spot that shit right off . Oh , Bob . Hey , hey . I get you another drink . There 's not much left to do . I wish there was , but ... Not in here . - He can 't hear us . - You don 't know that . It 's not easy to see our loved ones deteriorate , is it ? My sister , his mother , wanted him to live . I 'm all he has . Should he deteriorate further , would you like us to take measures to sustain his life ? Why do you people keep asking me that ? I 'm sorry . It is your decision . You do understand that what we 're doing is not helping Glenn , it 's just keeping him alive . I understand . I don 't know what to do , Glenn . I 'm sorry , Glenn . What ? - Hey man . - Owen ? - Yup . - What 's the matter ? She 's gone . What ? I don 't know , she got better and she went home . What do you mean , she got better ? What don 't you get , man ? She got better . Why ? What did the hospital say ? Who knows ? All I know is that she 's gone . Hmm . That 's all , man ! Peace . Owen , are you still there ? Look , man , I know your life 's been fucked up , but it 's been fucked up by other people . Owen ? Owen ? Owen ? Next Time on ReGenesis : Is the soul a part of our DNA , or is it an artifact of sperm meeting the egg during sexual- - Wes , you 've got to get her out of here before the ... Oh , shit . Since when do the bozos in Washington dictate the terms of our stem cell research ? They 're dictating the terms of employment of American paid researchers like Jill . We 're talking about a potential treatment for juvenile diabetes , okay ? - Tens of thousands of lives ... - Oh , shit ! Nitrogen , potassium , and phosphates . - The three components of fertilizers . - Uh-huh ! Why would there be a farm in the subway ? Why would someone want to grow something in the subway ?

 It 's been five months since we saw Ashley . - MR SMITH : I have a genetic match . - What ? Luke and Ashley Stafford are the same person . - Why can 't I remember them ? - Ashley ! Thank God . Children have no place in my life . - You don 't mean that . - Go home . - MITRE . - Who developed it ? You told her about MITRE ? Those headsets take the latent raw psychic ability all humans possess to move objects with the power of thought , and directs it . Mr Smith , are you asking me to go back to Pharos and steal one of those headsets ? - It would be of great assistance . - We 'll see . Luke with that pair that reckon he 's their kid . I think it 's fake . - Xylok , are you there ? - You 're right , Clyde . I faked it . ( GROANING ) You 're Slitheen ? ( EVIL LAUGHTER ) ( SONIC LIPSTICK BEEPING ) ( LOCK CLICKS ) ( BEEPING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( VOICE AND STATIC ON WALKIE-TALKIE ) ( BEEPS ) ( ALARM BLARING ) MAN ON PA : Intruder ! Perimeter defences have been armed . Any attempt to escape may result in death . - You have been warned ! - Noted . Hope that didn 't sting too much . This is Clyde . If you want me , and I don 't blame you , leave me your number , especially if you 're cute . Clyde , what 's going on ? Ring me back . Where are you ? Hello ? Hello ? Anyone ? Where am I ? ( ECHOES ) Where am I ? Just a clue ? ( BEEPING ) At least I 'm still alive . I think . ( ECHOES ) I think . No , Mrs Langer , I haven 't seen him . Don 't worry , I 'm sure he stayed at a mate 's . If I see him , I 'll tell him to ring you , okay ? - Something wrong ? Clyde 's not answering his phone and didn 't go home last night . - When did you last see him ? - Lunchtime yesterday . He skipped school to go and see Luke . He rang me later . He doesn 't think they 're really Luke 's parents . Maria , I know I 'm new to this X Files stuff , but surely , isn 't it likely that Luke is a normal boy who lost his memory rather than Frankenstein Jr put together by these aliens , the Bean ? The Bane . And Clyde thought he 'd got proof that these people are fakes . What ? Fake parents or fake people ? Maybe both . What if they 've done something to Clyde ? - His mother must be going out of her mind . - I 've got to go and look for him . No , you don 't . I 'm part of this now . I 'm coming with you . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) If I was an alien bent on invasion , I think I 'd choose a palace . - They 're not in . Come on . - Where ? House is empty . It 's our chance to find out something about them . - Maria ! - There may be a window round the back . Housebreaking ! Maybe your mother was right about you hanging around with Sarah Jane . - Keep quiet and start looking . - Right . What are we looking for ? Anything that 'll tell us who they are or what they 've done with Luke and Clyde . Who they are and what they 've done ... Agh ! They 've skinned someone ! They 're cannibals ! They 're not cannibals . They 're Slitheen . - Where are you taking me ? - ( MOCKING ) Where are you taking me ? What will you gain from revenge ? - Why are children full of stupid questions ? - You 're a child . I 'm Slitheen . You are going to give me my revenge . I don 't think I want to do that . Are you sure we should be doing this ? The Xylok said to wait . Are you questioning my authority ? You want to trust a Xylok ? You 're as thick as a human . - What 's a Xylok ? - See what I mean ? ( BOTH LAUGHING ) This is starting to look distinctly uncool , Clyde . No way in and no way out . - And no one to tell me what the hell 's going on . - MR SMITH : I can tell you . - Mr Smith ? Where are you ? - The relevant question is , where are you ? - Hold on , you 've gone bad . You zapped me . - I haven 't gone bad , I 'm fulfilling my purpose . - Which is to zap me into ... Where , exactly ? - This will have to wait , but we can chat later . It will pass the last few hours before you all die . Before ... What ? - SARAH JANE : Mr Smith , I need you . - You called me , Sarah Jane . Mr Smith 's going to kill us all , and I 'm inside him . - I got the headset . - It will be of great assistance . No ! Sarah Jane ! ( BEEPING ) Can you hear me ? He 's the bad guy ! I will let you have my conclusion in due course . Assessing . This does not sound good at all . You 've got to do something . Think ! You 're inside a computer , what can you do ? We 've got to tell Sarah Jane . That you found a kitten to replace that boy she kidnapped ? I don 't remember giving you a key . You didn 't remember to lock the door . Lucky I came by . Your computer 's making a noise . I better look at it . - Maria , would you get us some teabags ? - Sure . Sure she 'll be all right - with that child-snatching maniac around ? - Yes . She can look after herself . And Sarah Jane 's not a child snatcher or a maniac . Come on . - What are you doing ? - More stupid questions . Maria , I told you , I don 't want you here . They 're not Luke 's parents . They 're Slitheen . Hello , Nathan . What are you doing here on a Saturday ? ( HIGH-PITCHED TONE BLARING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GIGGLING ) Go ! He 'll be out cold for hours . By then , it will all be over . You can 't go out and leave things on ! It 's a fire hazard . Look at it . It 's not supposed to do that . Well , I can 't hang around . Ivan 's taking me shopping . Oh , make sure you keep Maria away from her . - The sooner she 's locked up , the better . - Yeah , sure . It 's always your trouble , Alan . Work . Don 't worry , let myself out . ( BEEPING ) Mr Smith , we need you . MR SMITH : You called , Sarah Jane ? Do you have information on Slitheen activity on Earth ? - Slitheen ? Why do you ask ? - You got it wrong . They weren 't Luke 's parents . They 're Slitheen . ( LAUGHING EVILLY ) - Mr Smith ? - Humans , so inevitably predictable . - Get out ! Mr Smith , he 's one of the bad guys . - Don 't be ridiculous . Who told you those people were Luke 's parents ? - Mr Smith ? What 's going on ? - I have a purpose . It must be fulfilled . The Slitheen have been useful , and so have you . - But you are no longer required . - Get down ! ( MR SMITH LAUGHING ) ALAN : Let 's get out of here . I trusted him with my life , with the whole planet . - What 's happened to him ? - Some kind of computer virus . - Maybe Clyde can tell us . - Clyde ? Yeah . Come on . Now this is refreshingly unpredictable . Communicating with Mr Jackson 's computer . Well done , Clyde . You 're not as stupid as you pretend to be , are you ? When it comes to pretending , you take the biscuit . We thought you were on our side . I 'm a Xylok . I 'm not on anybody 's side . I have my purpose . As for your interference , it is of minimal inconvenience . Sarah Jane can 't stop me achieving that purpose . And soon , you will play your part in it . But now your communications are terminated . ( GROANS ) ALAN : It wasn 't online messaging . He was just there . - MARIA : He 'd hacked in ? - Never seen anything like it before . Find out what 's going on . You think what 's happened to Mr Smith - has anything to do with Luke and the Slitheen ? - It must have . But how ? Could Mr Smith have some connection with the Slitheen ? Where did he come from ? The biggest volcanic eruption civilisation has ever seen . Eighteen months ago , when I was researching volcanic activity , a geologist friend sent me a crystal from the site of Krakatoa . The crystal had become a curiosity among geologists . They 'd never seen anything like it . Neither had I. But they didn 't see what I did . It was as if the crystal was communicating with my laptop and using it to communicate with me . It was a memory cell from a spacecraft that crashed years ago . Its computing power , its knowledge , it was phenomenal . It told me amazing things . It said it could help me keep track of alien life form coming to Earth . It could help protect the Earth . But our technology was too limited . And so it designed and created Mr Smith . - So why turn against you ? - We have to work it out as we go . We have to find Luke . I gave him to the Slitheen . I have to get him back . They want to use him to invade . The Slitheen don 't invade planets . They 're not a race , they 're a family . They 're scavengers . It 's Only Fools and Horses with green skin and claws . Slitheen are dealers , they sell anything . And in some parts of the galaxy , telekinetic energy fetches a huge price . Slitheen could have got the plans for the telekinetic energiser , had it built at the Pharos . There was a reason I didn 't care for Nathan . Telekinetic energy ? Moving things with your mind ? Luke 's mind , created by the Bane , the most incredible mind on the planet . If the Slitheen can harness it , Luke 's telekinetic powers could be massive . So , they bottle it and sell it ? What happens to Luke ? If they take it all , and the Slitheen never leave anything behind that they can sell , Luke will die . We have to find him , and I know where to look . - Have you got any vinegar ? - No , we 're all out . - We may have to stop off at a chip shop . Go . - Yeah . ( SLITHEEN LAUGHING ) I 'm going to fight you . Love it . The more brain activity , the faster we 'll harvest the telekinetic energy . And we want it all . Every spark from every synapse . Until you 're dead . - We 're all set here . - Then let 's energise . It 's working . He 's filled up two storage tanks already . NATHAN : I 've never seen so much energy ! We 're gonna be rich ! He 's a telekinetic power station ! We 'll be able to afford one supernova of a holiday this year ! Oh ! Dak Tex Fize ! NATHAN : Look out ! He 's overloading the system ! - What 's happening ? - Bloorm Vungah Bart ! He 's using his own telekinetic energy . He 's getting away ! Nazdracks to the profit . I 'll have my revenge warm and dripping . I 'm coming , Luke . I can smell your fear , Luke . Yes , Luke . Run . Run ! ( LAUGHING ) Never mind phasers or photon torpedoes . Never mind Arnie 's Uzi 9-millimetre . We 're taking on these aliens with vinegar ? It 's acetic acid . Slitheen are calcium life forms . - Calcium and acetic acid don 't mix . Trust me . - Sure . Why not ? Revenge at last , Luke . I 'm going to enjoy this kill . This is for my father . You 're as slippery as the Bane that made you . - What happened here ? - SARAH JANE : With a little luck , Luke did . ( GROANING ) Oh , my head . Oh . - I 'm armed . - What 's going on ? - What have you done with my son ? - The brat ? Back on Raxacoricofallapatorius we 'd spank his backside with a Bartleboigle tree . - We 're not there . So where is he ? - He got away . - But that doesn 't matter . - Leave her alone . You killed my father , Sarah Jane Smith . At the school . Use your sonic device . Open the door ! ( SCREAMING ) You were the Slitheen child ? I didn 't want you to die . But you were going to kill our planet . Get away from my daughter , you overgrown newt ! You drop your weapon , or she dies . ( SLITHEEN PANTING ) - ALAN : Now let her go , frog-face . - Dad ! - What now ? - Now we contact the Xylok . Get this deal back on the rails , once we 've found the youngling again . - The Xylok ? - You know him as Mr Smith . - Why would Mr Smith make a deal with you ? - NATHAN : He contacted us . He said he had seen what you did to my family . He wanted to help us get revenge . Then why did Mr Smith send me here to find the telekinetic energiser ? - He sent you here ? - It 's all been part of his plan . He brought you to Earth to build the energiser . He told me to come here looking for it . - I don 't understand . - Neither do I. Not yet . I think the last part of his plan is falling into place . Mr Smith knew Luke would escape , and he knew that when he did , he would run straight back to my house . Right back to him . - Sarah Jane ! Sarah Jane ! - MR SMITH : Luke . Up here , Luke . So what does Mr Smith want with Luke ? - Luke ? - Yeah . And the telekinetic energiser headset . Mr Smith had me steal one of them . The prototype 's in my attic . I 'll deal with the Xylok later . We don 't need him to avenge our family . If you kill us , you 'll never stop Mr Smith or get off this planet alive . Save your breath . You 'll need it when the screaming starts . Get off ! Let me go ! She 's my kill ! A claw for a claw ! When you 're older , you 'll learn not to make snap decisions . ( SNIGGERING ) Now what do you mean ? Something Mr Smith said about the telekinetic energiser . With the right mind , it could be a destroyer of worlds . He meant Luke 's mind . I think he 's planning to destroy the Earth . Come in , Luke . - Where 's Sarah Jane ? - She left something for you . - Put it on , Luke . - No . There really isn 't time to argue . - Clyde ? - Put it on or I will kill him . - But you 're ... - Running out of time and patience . Put the headset on . Now . That 's more like it . At last , we can begin . ( BEEPING ) - What 's that ? - MITRE , it 's gone online . - Mr Smith . He 's using the headset on Luke . - Massive telekinetic levels . They 're off the scale . NATHAN : The moon ! It 's moving ! - But it 's not possible . - Luke isn 't possible . Mr Smith isn 't possible . But together , they 're bringing the moon crashing down on Earth . But the moon , it 's a quarter of a million miles away . SARAH JANE : We 'll be dead long before it hits us . The gravitational effect will tear the planet apart . It 's already happening . At least I 'll be able to tell my family that you 're dead , Sarah Jane Smith . - I 'm teleporting back to the ship . - No . You 're as much to blame for all this as Mr Smith . Stay . Your ship would be torn apart by gravitational disturbance . You would die . On the other hand , if you help me , we might all just have one chance to survive . I need you to destroy Mr Smith . MR SMITH : Give me more , and let the universe witness the power of the Xylok once more . ( MR SMITH LAUGHING ) MAN ON TV : The moon is heading to Earth and it 's causing spontaneous forest fires . Indeed , we have had reports of avalanche , freak storms and tidal waves . As this continues , it becomes more ... ( PHONE RINGING ) - Chrissie ? - Alan , where are you ? ( CAR ALARM BLARING ) - It 's the end of the world ! - Chrissie , calm down . Calm down ? Alan , I need to be with you and Maria . Alan ! ( LINE GOES DEAD ) Chrissie ? Chrissie ? - The phone line 's gone . - SARAH JANE : We 're almost out of time . I get paid by companies to block cyber threats . I understand viruses . I know how they work . - But Mr Smith , he 's more than a computer . - Dad , you 're our only chance . Well , then , this is my best shot . The FBI had to stop a cyber terrorist from using this to destroy the international banking network . So how did you get hold of it ? You 're not the only one with unorthodox contact . Time to show me how this works . The United Nations is in emergency session to discuss this apocalyptic crisis . ( SCREAMING ) - Luke ? - MR SMITH : Sarah Jane . - You came to say goodbye . - Why are you doing this ? The collision of the moon and Earth will release the Xylok from the planet 's crust , where it has been buried for 60 million years . - You 're going to kill billions . - The Xylok are a crystalline life form . We crashed here as a meteorite . But beneath the Earth , our crystals have re-grown and become strong but nevertheless remain trapped . You 're part of the crystal . You 're in contact with it ? The release of the Xylok is my purpose . You gave me the chance to fulfil it . The chance to plan . All this time , you used me ? Mr Smith , you 're evil . No . Effective . We will do so much more than the human race . The universe is served better by our survival . Any race thinking it 's better than another , that 's evil . - I am not evil . - So what have you done with Clyde ? - Am I not merciful ? - CLYDE : What a dream . You made all this possible , Sarah Jane . I owe you the mercy of a quick death . What about other people ? Don 't they deserve mercy ? You 've been here millions of years , seen us evolve . - Don 't we matter to you ? - Only my purpose matters . - You can change your purpose . - No , I told you , we all have a purpose . Yours is to die so that the Xylok will live . After all , what life do you have alone in your attic ? You think I 'm alone ? You think I 'm defenceless ? - Well , meet my dog . K9 , protect me ! - K9 : Affirmative , mistress . Maximum defence mode . Take care , mistress , and you , young master . Safe to proceed , mistress . I have the unit covered . - Do you wish me to continue firing ? - Just be ready if I need you , K9 . - Very good , mistress . - A robot dog called K9 ? - K9 : Affirmative . - I am dreaming , aren 't I ? MR SMITH : What have you done to me , Sarah Jane ? - I feel ... I feel strange . - It 's a computer virus , Mr Smith . It 's closing down your databanks . You 're losing your memory . The speed of light is 36 ... No , 84 ... The Metrabeelen Cosmic Cluster is home to 68,000 life forms , 67 ... I 'm forgetting it all . Sarah Jane , help me . Without your memories , you have no purpose . You can 't destroy the Earth . Put the moon back into its original orbit . And set Luke free now ! - I 've forgotten my purpose . - Your purpose is to save the Earth . That is your new purpose , to save Earth . Save the Earth . Yes , I have a purpose . Thank you , Sarah Jane . The unit is non-functional . He did it . It worked . The moon 's going back . - Is everything satisfactory , mistress ? - Affirmative , K9 . Must return to the distortion , mistress . Without my attention , black hole will turn critical in 0.42 time spatial increments . Go now . Good dog . I 'll see you again soon . - Mum ? - Oh , Luke . SARAH JANE : I 've seen amazing things out there in space . But strange things can happen wherever you are . - There they go . - Back to Raxacoricofallapatorius . - And good riddance . - Will they be back ? - Oh , I expect so . Sooner or later . - What about Mr Smith ? Can we trust him again ? The Armageddon Code has wiped his circuits . He 'll reboot with a new purpose , to safeguard the world . ( CLEARS THROAT ) MARIA : Mum ! SARAH JANE : What a beautiful night . Please come and join us . SARAH JANE : I have learnt that life on Earth can be an adventure , you never know what you might find . In all the universe , I never expected to find a family . DVD Rip by DrMatt 2008

 My name is chandra suresh . I 'm a geneticist . I have a theory about human evolution , And I believe you are a part of it . What makes some walk a path of darkness , While others choose the light ? Is it will ? Is it destiny ? Can we ever hope to understand the force That shapes the soul ? For thousands of years , My people have taken spirit walks , Following destiny 's path Into the realms of the unconsciousness . Okay . I 'm ready to begin my journey . Hiro ? Hiro ? To fight evil , one must know evil . One must journey back through time And find that fork in the road hiro ? ! Where heroes turn one way hiro ? ! And villains turn another . I 'd like to thank all our dear friends For coming tonight And for helping us to celebrate . Nathan- - the finest assistant d.A. New york has ever known . Peter , Whose compassionate heart is a gift to us all . Told you he couldn 't say " nurse " out loud . All right . But most of all , To angela ... The love of my life . Happy anniversary . Cheers . That was lovely . Let me have a- - All right , get a room . After 41 years of marriage , You take it where you can get it . My king . My queen . Congratulations . Thank you , daniel . Thank you . Congratulations . So , nathan , are the rumors true ? Excuse me ? I heard your office Is about to launch a full-scale investigation Into all things linderman . Care to comment ? I 'd shave my wrists . Handcuffs chafe . Come on . Let 's get a drink . Oh . Good one . What do see in there , arthur ? Trouble . Well , I 'm sure I can handle the heat . It 's not you I 'm worried about . If he starts investigating , he 's gonna see your hand Behind every enterprise I 've been working on For the past 25 years . We can 't have the d.A. Digging up skeletons . If you fall , I fall . Maybe you could talk to him one last time . Convince him to back off . When nathan digs his teeth in , he doesn 't let go . So what do we do ? Read your shakespeare . When the son challenges the father , Only one is left standing . I should have one last talk with him . I owe him that . What happens if that doesn 't take ? Well , then I 'll ... Memphis , Tennessee One year ago And now , who 's the man , yo ? I 'm the man . I 'm sorry , who 'd you say ? Who 's the man ? I 'm the man ! Look at this here . Back door- - book it ! Yeah , you got it . You- - flint . Hey ! Hey , buddy ! Hey , kiss the floor ! Flint , let it go ! Hey , buddy ! I 'm talking to you . You should listen to your sister . Run ! Flint , let 's go ! Run ! Brooklyn , New York One Year ago My name is brian davis . Incredible . Can you make it go away ? Don 't worry , brian . I can fix it . Don 't worry , brian . I can fix it . Hello ? Make it go away , make it go away . Are you all right ? Say something . Forgive me . It 's okay . Everything is gonna be okay . No , it isn 't . One Year ago I 've done something unforgivable . Everybody does bad things . You think I haven 't felt exactly how you 're feeling right now ? Maybe if you talk about it . Sometimes when you talk about it- - I can 't . A man had something that I wanted , But I took it at a terrible price . I know it seems hard to imagine , But you 're gonna get through this , Because you 're not a bad person . You don 't even know anything about me . I know what I see- - A man who deserves a second chance . The rope broke . You can 't tell me that 's not a sign . I don 't even know your name . Elle . Elle . Well , look at you , elle , just showing up out of nowhere , Like an angel . An angel with a broken watch . Cute meet . I still don 't understand Why we don 't just bag and tag this guy Like the rest of them . For years , scientists were stumped By the mystery of whale migration . Such a big ocean- - How do they find each other ? And then one night in the frozen pacific , Some enterprising biologist recorded their song In the wild . They don 't sing in captivity . So we 've got to get the whale to sing . What mr . Gray can do is extraordinary . The ability to transfer power from one vessel to another Is extremely rare . Yeah , but how do I get him to do it ? Pie . Nine group homes in seven years . Four of them burned to the ground . There 's a shocker . What 's the deal ? I mean , isn 't that why we 're here , So you can offer me a deal ? You have a gift , meredith , And with gift comes opportunity . The company would like to train you to become an agent . It won 't be easy . It 'll demand a lot of hard work . Me , an agent ? I don 't think so . Why do you hate the company so much ? I have my reasons . And I would ask you ... To put those reasons aside And make the sensible decision . That ... Or spend the rest of your life in an asbestos-lined cell . One condition ... Promise me the company won 't go after my brother . You 're not in a strong negotiating position here , So what will it be- - Agent or prisoner ? When do I start ? Arthur ? You look spectacular . I wish you would reconsider . He can barely fit a dozen people in that shoe box anyway . Arthur , it 's his graduation party . Yeah , from nursing school . Be patient with him . When his powers manifest , peter will become a great man . Tell him I 'm sorry I couldn 't get there . Hey , there . Just thought I 'd stop by to see if- - I tried . He won 't . Nathan , while you 're here ... I really wish You 'd reconsider handing off The linderman case to another a.D.A. Come on , dad , we 've talked about this . I 'm not asking as a lawyer . I 'm asking as a father . I 'm concerned about the pressure That your prosecuting my client will put on this family . Don 't be . Linderman 's toxic To this family , dad . Nothing would make me happier than to bury him In a very deep hole for a very long time . What ? You look good in a suit , nathan . One Year ago What does this guy want ? Nathan ! Heidi ! Heidi ! Nathan ! Thank god ! Is she all right ? Don 't even talk to me , dad . Nathan . You think I don 't know who did this ? It was linderman 's guys That ran me off the road . Are you sure ? That 's it , dad ? That 's the best you got- - am I sure ? You invite that man into our home . He tried to kill me , dad ! Come on , stop . Heidi will never walk again ! Stop ! Stop ! Just stop . Okay . Heidi ... It 's her spine . She broke her back . Oh , god ! Oh , no ! I know . Mom . She just woke up , and she 's asking for you . Come on . I 'm gonna hurt that man . And when I do , if you 're standing next to him , You 're gonna get hurt too . You might want to choose a side , dad- - Your client or your family . Nathan . Any word ? I spoke with the neurologist . Her spine is broken in three places . It doesn 't look good . Arthur ... What nathan said about linderman ... You can 't be serious . Come on , angela . Linderman wouldn 't dare go after nathan on his own . No , he wouldn 't . What are you asking ? Am I trying to kill my son ? Nathan 's an assistant d.A. It could 've been any one of 100 indicted criminals Driving that van . I will not have this conversation . No , I know . You 're right . But I need to hear you say it , arthur . Did you order linderman to kill nathan ? No . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I love you , arthur . I love you too . Austin , Texas One Year ago There 's our man . You want me to light him up ? Negative . This is strictly a training mission . You 're gonna watch and learn . No powers , unless I give the order . Danny pine ? Who wants to know ? Jim farrell with the v.A. I just need a minute of your time , pal . My partner and i Are trying to transition some of the homeless vets out here Into affordable housing . We feel it 's a crime The way this country 's turned its back on you guys . Yeah , what happened to scofield ? Scofield ? The v.A. Rep that was out here last week . Right . Oh , yeah , he was reassigned to dallas . Uh , farrell and i- - we 're the new team now . That 's the story . Queens , New York One Year ago Hi . Do you like pie ? Oh , that rhymed , didn 't it ? Come on in . I 'm really--i 'm really glad you came , elle . I-i wasn 't sure you would . I have been thinking about you And--and wondering how you 've been since- - Oh , better . Great , actually , um ... Thanks to you . I just decided To clean up this place , and all this clutter Was filling my head with bad thoughts . Yeah . What 's this ? Oh , that 's just , um ... It 's just a list of people like me . Nice , single guys like you ? Maybe I should take this list . Oh , no , no ... Um , I 'm sorry , elle . There 's ... There 's something you should know about me . I have a kind of a power- - Um , an ability That 's out of the ordinary . I don 't understand . Oh , my god . The other people on the list- - they can do things too . W- - Wait . There are others ? What kind of pie did you bring ? Peach . That 's my favorite kind . Good work , meredith . You were born for this . Yeah , so that 's it ? I 'm an agent now ? Not quite . Getting scum off the street , that 's the easy part . The real test is loyalty . You 're not gonna always agree With the decisions the company makes , But when you prove you can follow orders No questions asked , That 's when we 'll call you " agent gordon . " Put him in cell nine . Come on . Meredith ? ! Flint ? ! I thought you got away . Yeah , well , an invisible man tackled me in the alley . What , are they gonna make you an agent also ? What ? What do- - what do you mean " also " ? What did they tell you ? They 're gonna train me , mer . I 'm gonna get to wear One of them , uh , suits and everything . Oh , flint . This is gonna be great , mer . It 's gonna be you and me , working together . Is there a problem ? No , sir . Good . No problem at all . This is bag and tag , baby , bag and tag ! I can 't believe You can just lift your finger and move things . It must feel amazing . It does . But it can be overwhelming too ... Like a drug that you can 't get enough of . How many others are there like you ? With abilities ? I don 't know . To be honest , I don 't want to know . I have a kind of problem . I guess you could say I 'm like an addict . I have this overwhelming hunger to ... Um , I covet the powers of others . But somehow , since the other day , since ... Since meeting you ... I feel like maybe I don 't have to be so special . Maybe I can just be gabriel again . But you are special , gabriel . You 're special just the way you are . " special just the way you are . " I was afraid you were about to burst into song . I was just trying to win his trust . Yeah , well , we 're stalling out here . We need to kick it into high gear . I don 't think he 's gonna kill again . I really think we should look Into someone else on this list . No , we 're sticking with the plan . Mr. Gray is a killer . We know that . The only question is , " will we witness the act , Or will he do it in a dark alley somewhere ? " But what if you 're wrong ? What if his suicide attempt was a wake-up call ? You like this guy . Isn 't that adorable ? You think he 's sweet , is that it ? What about this one- - trevor zeitlan ? I 'm not gonna do it . We need to see him kill . I am not going to do it . All right , if that 't's how you feel . Here , go ahead . Go on . New york city- - you could , I don 't know , Become a waitress ? We have orders , elle . You don 't follow orders , you 're not an agent . You 're not an agent , you 're on your own . Your father has been training you for this Since you were four years old . Come on . Let 's introduce mr . Zeitlan to mr . Gray . I 'm sorry , arthur . I don 't know how he survived that crash . You know how badly you screwed this up ? Now nathan 's out for blood . Look , maybe we should rethink this . I mean , a second attempt is bound to look suspicious , And who knows how angela 's gonna react ? What do you suggest- - we abort ? No , no . Not abort , no . Postpone . You 're not thinking this through . The plan for new york has been years in the making . Do we postpone that , too ? No , no , not necessarily . I don 't know , daniel . Sometimes I worry you 're outliving your usefulness . You 're--you 're right , arthur . We should finish this . I know a guy in montreal . He worked for me in vegas . He 's good . Now , I can fly him down tonight . Angela . Angela ! Angela ! It has to be done , angela . Arthur , Don 't . You know I 'm right . It has to be done . He 's my baby . Say it , angela . My baby . Nathan has to die . It has to be done . Nathan has to die . Murder Hiro . Hiro ! Murder Hiro , wake up . No , don 't wake him . Why ? What 's happening ? He 's trapped between this world and the next . If he wakes now , he could be stuck like this forever . Wha--we have to do something . Here ... Mix . Something has disturbed his dream time . Part of him wants to wake , But his spirit walk is not complete . Careful not to inhale the fumes . It 's working . Yes . Put your shoes on ! What ? What 's going on ? There 's a train yard a half mile from here . We can catch a freight straight on into houston . What are you talking about ? What about us being agents ? Now , these--these people been nice to me . They 're tricking you because you 're dumb . You remember what daddy used to say- - " god gave you a big sister instead of a brain . " Put your shoes on . Now . Once we reach houston , We 'll head straight on into mexico , Fly under the radar for a little while . Maybe we 'll work in a little cantina . Mexico sounds good . Flint . Flint , you got to understand something . You can 't ever trust the company . They will lie to you . Th 'll lock you up or worse . You hear me , flint ? You got to promise me that you 'll never , ever- - You killed her ! That 's right , genius . I killed her . Son of a bitch . You were following me , huh ? Why do you have to screw this up ? Oh , come on , flint , an agent ? We could 've given him a purpose ! Now--now he 's our sworn enemy . So am i ! That smells good . Almost as good as my pot pies . Daniel , I think arthur 's downtown . Yes , he is . What 's on your mind ? The question is , angela , What isn 't on yours . Look ... It wasn 't an easy decision to come , But believe it or not , I still have a shred of morality left in me somewhere . I can no longer stand by And watch him destroy you like this . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I know he 's working on a project . I don 't remember the , uh , details right now , But I 'm sure it has to be done . I can 't push a thought into your head , angela , But I can heal the scars . What scars ? ! From all the times he 's forced his thoughts , Erased your memories . Each time leaves its mark- - A trace of damaged tissue . I don 't believe you . Arthur would never do that to me . Arthur is betraying you In the most heinous way possible . How dare you ? He 's gonna kill your son . You 're a liar . I can heal the scars , angela , But you have to decide . Do you want to live in blind obedience ? Or do you want to know the truth ? Nathan . So you never answered my question . Why do you hate the company so much ? 'cause they killed my baby girl . It was 14 years ago . They caught up with me In this little village off the panhandle . They stormed in at night . There was a firefight . Place went up like kindling . And my little girl , claire , she was killed in the fire . Claire . That 's what they told you- - she died in a fire . What is that supposed to mean ? Go . Go on before I change my mind . What ? Think of it as a get-out-of-jail-free card For your little girl . Go . This ziti smells terrific . Can 't wait . Hey , have you ever been to that little theater down the street ? I saw that they had Some sort of artsy spoken-word thing there tonight . Maybe we should stop by later . Oh . Hmm , maybe we should . Oh , I invited someone to join us . I hope you don 't mind . It 's open ! Yeah , um , I 'm trevor . We spoke on the phone . I 'm elle . And , um , this is gabriel . I thought you two should meet . Trevor has an ability , too . An ability- - I don 't understand . Don 't be mad , but I got Trevor 's number off that list you had . I really think it 's important for you To get to know people like yourself . I mean ... Alcoholics can 't do it alone . Trevor , why don 't you show us What you can do ? Okay . That is so cool . Gabriel ? Isn 't that special ? Wait here . I have a great idea . Soup is delicious . Italian lentil- - your mother 's recipe . Something on your mind ? What 's the matter , arthur ? You can 't see inside it ? You just seem ... Far away . I just wonder sometimes if , Without your power , you 'd ... Know me at all anymore . Indigestion ? So what do you think , arthur ? Do you still know me ? Can you tell anything about me just by looking in my eyes ? You 're my wife , angela . I know you like I know my own heart . Really ? So what am I gonna do now ? Am I gonna kiss you , Or am I gonna kill you ? I love that . Don 't you love that ? That 's great . It 's so special . Let 's see it again . You think he 's so special ? I bet He can 't do this . Gabriel . I think you need to leave , Now . Gabriel , don 't ! Please ... How did you- - You don 't have to do this . Who are you ? Get out . We can 't do this . Bennet , we have to make him stop ! This is incredible . He actually exposes the brain . Our son , arthur , our own son . There are larger issues at stake , angela . You can 't let sentimentality Derail everything that we 've worked so hard for . I 'm sentimental because I don 't want to murder our son ? We were gonna rebuild the world . You were a great man , arthur . You were a visionary , But somewhere along the line , you lost your soul . And I make no apology- - I lied . It 's not your mother 's recipe . Use the incinerator on level three . Use my pass card to grant you access . Should anyone ask , He 's a casualty of a field op . Ma ? Nathan . Anybody home ? Ma ? ! Dad ! Oh , my god . I think he 's had a heart attack . Is he ... ? He 's still breathing . He 's still alive . We 're wrapped here- - just one more loose end . No , no , not that thing- - the other thing . Okay , I 'll let you know . Don 't beat yourself up . We 've done invaluable work here . Those tapes will be studied and analyzed . We created a monster . We set him loose on the world . I wouldn 't worry too much about that . I get the feeling That we 'll be tracking down mr . Gray again soon . That 's not the point ! He had a soul , bennet . He could 've been saved . We 're not missionaries . If they had wanted us to bring him in , That would 've been the assignment . It wasn 't . We follow orders , elle . We 're agents . That 's what we do . Now excuse me . Where to , my friend ? Jfk , please . We should call peter . Maybe we should wait . Until what ? Until we have something to tell him . I 'm sorry . He 's gone . He suffered a massive coronary , Brought on by anterior myocardial infarction . There was- - there was nothing we could do . Heart attack ? I 'd like a cremation as soon as possible . Why don 't you go home and get some rest ? We can deal with the paperwork in the morning . I can 't believe it . He 's dead . It 's done . Yes . I understand . She wants a cremation . I can procure another body , of course . I 'm afraid the poison caused irreversible damage To the peripheral nervous system . The paralysis will likely be permanent . I 'm sorry . He 's with izzy now . Izzy . Thank you . Yeah . Izzy . Yeah . He hated that dog . Of course . It was the only living thing he met that ever disobeyed him . You remember we would sit with dad out here When we were kids , Watch as he buried her bones . Yeah . Yeah , I can 't believe he 's gone . Let 's not idolize your father because he 's dead . He wasn 't a god . He was a man ... Deeply flawed in ways you will never know . Present Day He ¡ ¯ s alive ! Hiro . You ¡ ¯ re back ! We must warn Angela Petrelli ! And Nathan And Flint ¡ ¯ s sister , Meredith , she may be able to ... Hiro , slow down ! Something is wrong Usutu ! No ! I understand you 've been dreaming About me . Hiro ! To be continued ... 709

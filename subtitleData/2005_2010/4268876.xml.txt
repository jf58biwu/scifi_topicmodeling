 This is just wrong ; digging up these graves . Why is she making us do this ? Mom has her reasons , Pete . She 'll share when she 's ready . Give her time . Come on , give him a chance . Why ? Look what he 's turning us into . He knows what he 's done , and he 's carrying enough guilt for all of us . But he 's here , isn 't he ? He needs our support . Boy , he charmed you . Don 't worry . It happens to all of us . I 'm gonna go talk to her . What 're we doing here , Mom ? You said we came here to find your sister . We didn 't know you had a sister . Look , we need some answers . Mom , what happened out here ? Angela ... Angela and Alice Shaw . Good . That 's everybody . Welcome to Coyote Sands . My name is Dr. Chandra Suresh . Please follow me . Take a snack . Playground . The dining room . Game room . We show movies every night . And the best popcorn you 've ever had . You have a funny accent . So do you . So where are you from ? Bombay , India . I 've come a long way to meet you , to help you . These are your quarters , and your parents are just across the quad . Dr. Zimmerman will show you the way . Why do they have guns ? It 's alarming . I know . But this isn 't a prison . The guards are here for your protection . We want to keep you safe . Come on , let 's get you settled . I see you got the milk and cookies . We wanted to give you the official welcome . Welcome to Crapola Sands . I 'm Charles Deveaux . The guy with the funny accent is Daniel Linderman . And the guy with the glasses is Bobby Bishop . I didn 't think boys were allowed in the girls bunk . Uh , yes , yes . Well , um , Bobby here ... He ... He wanted to tell you how beautiful he thought you were . - I- - I did not . - What ? What , you don 't think she 's beautiful ? Anyway , we just wanted to say hi . I don 't like this . I want to be with Mom and Dad . We already talked about this . It 's going to be fun . Just like camp . Let 's get you unpacked . There 's only toys and books in here . You said pack what I need . You need clothes , Alice . Pants , shirts , socks . And how many times have you read 'Alice in Wonderland ' ? I want to go home , banana . And so do you . Prom is coming . The doctor told Mom and Dad that this place is going to make my nightmares go away . No more screaming ? But what I have is genetic . So we all need to deal with it . The entire family . Who snuck you out to see Sleeping Beauty ? And who gave Jackie Jacobs an Indian burn when she stole your barrette ? I will always be there for you . I promise . But I need you to be there for me , too . See ? Everything is going to be fine . Mom ? My sister , my parents ... they all died here . And if we don 't come together , if we don 't settle our differences ... I 'm afraid history 's going to repeat itself . S03E23 : 1961 1961 ... It was a different time . Kennedy was president , and we were all patriots . And when the government found out about us , they told us they could cure us . And we believed them . And they rounded us all up , and they put us here . What happened here ? I don 't know . I was lucky , I survived . But Alice , my entire family ... didn 't . So why are we here , Mom ? You could 've told us this in a restaurant . Why here ? Why are we digging up those bodies ? I 've been dreaming about my sister . Alive . That doesn 't make sense . But my dreams often don 't . They 're open to interpretation . They--they 're confusing , but I think--I think ... I have to see her for myself . I have to find her body , find a piece of clothing , something , anything to give her a proper burial . You should 've told us about this place . That--that you had a sister . I didn 't want you to know the pain . Mothers are allowed to do that . I 'm allowed to protect you . You 're absolutely allowed to do that , Ma . It 's my nightmare , Peter . I never wanted you to know what I suffered . I tried to forget . We made everyone forget . Who 's " we " ? How do you think The Company was formed ? It started here with a vow to never let this happen again . We destroyed files . Erased memories . We blackmailed , we killed . Anything to keep our existence secret . And it worked ... for 50 years . Now Noah and I have tried to fix this current situation , but Mr. Danko has proved resourceful . So that 's what you were trying to do . Yes . But you blew it . Yeah . The important thing is to put our secret back ... so we can all stop running , return to our lives . It 's time to go back to the old methods . You mean erasing people 's memories and killing ? It 's a necessary evil . I 'm sorry what happened here ... Mom . But it didn 't give you the right to do the things that you 've done , and it still doesn 't . We need you , Peter . I need you . Your company tore this family apart . I 'm not going to be a part of it again . Peter ! I 'll get him . You had a nightmare . What 's it to you ? I think I heard you talking to your sister about how your nightmares come true . Look , you 're not the only one who 's realised that something strange is happening to them . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Linderman . How 'd a pretty skirt like you get a scar like that ? A bicycle accident . This place is one big science experiment . And we 're the rats . You 're wrong . They 're going to help us . She 's right . We 're freaks . They 're going to make us normal . And you 're blind . Why do you think they have armed guards ? We 've done nothing wrong . It 's not like we 're Communists . My dad said we can trust them . This has happened before . Nazis with the Jews . America did it too ... with the Japs . This is different . We 're different . What was your nightmare ? My dreams are confusing . They 're not always right . You have to stop being afraid ... and start believing . That doctor ... Suresh . Don 't trust him . What 're you talking about ? Nothing . We 're all going back to sleep . My feet are cold , banana . That 's what you get for not bringing any socks . I 'll find you some . Say good night , Alice . Good night , Alice . I heard what you were saying to the boys . About Doctor Suresh . Those boys just have an overactive imagination . Remember when I got an F in History ? Dad took away the TV and dessert . I was so mad that I- - that night , a hail storm smashed his car . So ? I think I can control the weather . Is Doctor Suresh going to come for me ? Why didn 't you tell Nathan and Peter about your sister ? Where 's your father ? I asked for some alone time with you . I want to help you . I was almost your age when I came here . I was 16 . Every other thought was about boys and the prom . I was so na√Øve . I wish I had had half of your strength . You have courage and self confidence . You--you 've overcome all those nagging self-doubts . Maybe sometimes . Not always . I 'm still figuring it out . You dug up those graves without batting an eye . If I had had your spirit , if I had trusted myself , maybe things would 've been different here . Doesn 't answer my question . You ever do something so awful , something you are so ashamed of that you think if you ever talk about it , you might never stop crying ? Where did this come from ? This is what happened in my dream . It 's impossible ! But it is ... it 's her ! It 's Alice ! Dad ! Alice ! Alice ! - Come on , we got to get back inside ! - No ! You need to see a menu ? No , just a cup of coffee , please . Pete , we need to get through . Whatever it is , it 's between us . You 're not helping things by running away every time - things get a little bit tough- - - Running away ? So when you just disappear , you up and disappear and you go up forever . You went instead of staying in Washington and dealing with a problem that you created . Pete , you know , nobody can look down their nose at me better than you . 1986 Mets . You remember that ? Yeah . How dad had two tickets to the world series , and he had two other tickets to the playoffs . And you convinced me to go to the play-offs with him . I wanted to make sure you got to see a game , yeah . Come on , Pete , I couldn 't have known the Mets were gonna beat the Astros . Come on . You get to see Mookie Wilson in that game six . You saw him . I got lucky . - You got to see that game . - I got lucky . You think I conned you ? Into seeing a play-off game ? Yes . I do . Because even in your generosity , Nathan , you are selfish . And that is just who you are . Pete ... We have got to find a way to forgive each other . We have to find the capacity for forgiveness . - Because without that- - - I am trying ... really hard . This is the emergency broadcast network . A severe storm warning is in effect for the Greater Valley area . Claire ! Claire ! How did you find me ? Are there more agents coming ? I 'm not working with them any more . I tried to stop them from the inside . - And they found out . - You expect me to believe that ? It 's the truth . I tried ... and I failed . Angela Petrelli brought us here . Why ? What business does she have here ? She was taken here as a child . This was a place for people with abilities , experimenting , and eventually murder . What ? They killed hundreds . The graves are outside . What 're you doing here ? I found this . 50 years ago , my father was a doctor here . I came to find out what he was doing . Now , I 'm not so sure I want to know . Hello , Alice . Angela , can I talk with you ? Yes , of course , Dr. Suresh . It 's okay , Alice . Three wavy lines . Who are they ? Don 't worry about them . Just focus on the cards . Okay ? Let 's try again . A triangle . I 'm not reading your mind , if that 's what you think . I had a dream about this , about you showing me cards . A dream ? About this exact moment ? And does everything you dream come true ? They 're dreams . They 're confusing . And what else have you dreamt about ? About you . You 're going to kill everybody here . My parents . My sister . I can assure you ... That 's not going to happen . You are a good man . And you 've treated us with nothing but kindness . But I 'm telling you , it 's going to get out of your control . If you leave , it destroys all our work . Don 't you see the benefits your abilities could have for the world ? I only see my nightmares . Einstein said , " The life of the individual has meaning- - " Only in so far , " as it aids in making the life of every living thing nobler " and more beautiful . " You have read Einstein . No , I just dreamt that you would say that . You said yourself that dreams are confusing . Open to interpretation . Everything is going to be fine , Angela . Now ... this won 't hurt a bit . I tried to warn them ! I tried to make them stop . I tried to save them , save Alice . And now Alice is alive . If this is your sister , then why is she doing this ? She 's angry . You don 't believe me . Storms happen . It 's my sister ! What if it 's not ? ! No . I need to go find her . I need to deal with this alone . No ! It 's too dangerous out there ! Are you okay ? What is it ? Your mom . She 's gone . So what ? My father was Dr. Mengele ? You don 't know what happened here . It 's hard to ignore facts . - Which are what ? - He worked here . Everyone died , he survived . The most obvious answer is usually the right one . Working with the enemy doesn 't necessarily make you the enemy . You should know that . I met your father . He was a good man . You don 't know what he did , what he faced . What his intentions were . Who are we talking about ? Just ... don 't make any assumptions . Not until you know the truth . Any sign of my mother ? No . Nothing . She 's got to be around here somewhere . Let 's split up . Cover more ground that way . No one should be alone . Suresh ... will you go with Peter ? There 's no sign of her . Do you really think her sister survived this ? I don 't know . What was this place ? It 's where he experimented on them . I guess we 're destined to repeat our parents ' mistakes . How do you mean ? I mean I am my father 's son . Experimenting on human guinea pigs . And why ? Not for science . For self interest . You 're being too hard on yourself , Mohinder . We started this a long time ago , okay ? You and me . I know you . You 're a good person . Good intentions only go so far , Peter . I am weak . I 'm corruptible . - And I am selfish . - We 're all selfish . My brother has proven that point time and time again . I know what it 's like to have parents who are ... less than . My mother brought us here because she wants to start a new company . She thinks it 's the only way to keep this ... from happening again . But that first company she started was corrupt . Yes , but why ? And was it surviving this ? I mean , this has to come with--with fear and pain and anger . Maybe that 's why you can get it right . Because you never knew this pain . I have to believe that there is hope for redemption . I have to . Even for Nathan . You and Peter going to be all right ? I don 't know . He blames me for everything . Can 't say as I entirely disagree . You and I have made a mess of things . Yes , we did . Danko is working with Sylar . Sylar can change his shape . He can be anybody . He almost made me kill my wife . What was the last book you read ? 'Cause I can 't remember . Not the last book I read , last movie I saw ... You remember Movie Nights ? We used to rent old movies , make popcorn . When do we get to go back ? I don 't know . I miss it , too . You know , I should be a basket case . Digging up graves . I should be , but I 'm not . I 'm just ... not . I tried so hard to impress you . Both of you . Becoming an agent , trying to stop the bad guys . What you did was very brave . I was an idiot . All I wanted to do was grow up . Honey , that 's all any teenager ever wants . But you can 't fault yourself for that . Maybe not . Maybe I can . There was a time where I wanted to become a doctor . A chef . Class president . Not an agent . What are you waiting for ? Say your goodbyes , all right ? Are you sure ? Do we have to go right now ? Yeah . Linderman and Bob are already on the outside . We 're gotta go right now , while they 're changing guards . It 's our best chance to sneak out . Figure out where we are , how we can get help , and save everyone . Look , this is your plan . I know . - It 's just Alice . - Look , she can 't come . It 's dangerous . She 'll slow us down . I promised her I 'd never leave her alone . I get it . But we need you too . So keep her calm . Make sure she doesn 't blow this . How ? Lie . What were you talking about ? Me and the boys are going to go sneak out tonight . Cool , I 'm coming too . - No . - Why not ? Because you can 't , okay ? I just want to hang out with kids my own age . Are you going to make out ? No , don 't think like that . We 'll be back in a few . Cover for us . I 'm scared . Listen . I had a dream last night . About you . And it 's going to be safe here . I swear . You just have to stay here . We 'll be right back . Now say good night , Alice . Good night , Alice . Alice ? Alice ... Look at me . Please , just ... Turn around . Talk to me . # I was alright , for a while # # I grew smiles for a while # The cops don 't believe me . Come on , we have to convince them . Someone . This is serious and you guys are acting like children . We 're enjoying the moment . Do you want a fry ? Come on . Let 's have a dance . You missed your prom , and you love this song . I never told you that . Hey . We don 't allow that in here . No dancing . Not with a colored . We didn 't mean anything by it . Just pretend like this never happened . Your ability ? We don 't have to be afraid , Angela . Socks ! We need to get socks . For Alice . This is the emergency broadcast network . A severe storm warning is in effect . Flash floods and high winds have come out of nowhere . We have to get back to Alice . Now ! I 'm alive . You 're not going crazy . I almost didn 't recognize you . You look so old . Do I look old ? No . You look beautiful . Alice , how is this possible ? How ? Have you been here for 50 years ? When I found this place , it was packed with food . When I went through that , I did what I had to do . I stole ... what I needed . Clothes , food ... Stuff . Why did you stay ? You told me . Your dream . You said I 'd be safe if I stayed here . - I- - - And I trusted you . I thought I 'd be safe here . And the world would be safe ... from me . From you ? Oh , Alice . The night I left ... What happened that night , Alice ? When you left ... That doctor ... Suresh . He came for me . No . Alice ... Stop ! Alice ! Alice , wait ! Alice ! It 's okay . It 's okay , Alice ! It 's okay ! Alice ! Sorry . Get back inside . Now ! You don 't have to stay here anymore . Let me help you . It 's time to go home . I have socks for you . Since that night , whenever I-I feel lost ... whenever I don 't know what to do ... I steal socks for you . To remind myself , there are simple ways to protect the ones we love . You don 't ever have to be cold again . I am so sorry . Oh , banana ! It 's not your fault . Yes , it is . I lied to you ... that night . I thought I was doing the right thing . I was trying to protect you . I was trying to save you . - You ... - I 'm so sorry . You ... You ... I 'm so sorry ! Mom ! - Calm down ! - Alice , calm down ! - Calm down ! - Calm down ! No ! I have to talk to her . She 's going to kill you . No . I have to talk to her . Alice ! Stop ! This isn 't their fault . This is your family . This is my son . He 's your nephew , Alice . You have a family . And they 're the only ones who can make everything all right . Don 't punish them for my mistakes . I am so sorry . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Let 's go home . Say goodbye , Alice . No . Alice is gone . She 's nowhere . Judging from her reaction , I think I know what my father was doing here . Your father ... I found this . In the lab . It will give you some answers about your father . I don 't know ... The storm covered the graves . They 're all buried . Maybe it should remain that way . Fair enough . Let 's get out of here . I 'm not going with you , Peter . Why not ? Maybe you 're ready to move on , but I 'm not . I 'm not ready to forgive myself . Not yet . We can never let this happen again . Not ever . No one can know about us . - They already do . - Not for long . I had a dream ... about the future . We 're going to form a group . A company . It 's going to protect people like us . We 're just kids . Not anymore we 're not . What do we do in this dream ? Whatever we have to . They 're right to be afraid of us . The things we can do ... The things we 're going to do to keep this secret safe . It 's a necessary evil . I 'm never going to see her again . You don 't know that . I get it , Mom . The guilt , the ... But you got to let go of that . Come join us ? Come on . Okay , please someone say something . How are the fries ? Look , this isn 't a company . This is a family . There 's a big difference . Families have the capacity for forgiveness . You mean that ? We 're stronger together than we are apart . So there 's no more hunting . We 've got to make our existence secret . And try to put our lives back together . All right , so what now ? I 'll go back to Washington . Take ownership of my mistakes . And talk to the President . ... ready and willing to make it . Looks like you already have . The only real way to bring change is to bring real purpose back to the White House . - And I promise you ... - Who the hell is that ? That change will come to this country . Sylar . And nothing ... will ever be the same . Thank you all very much . I 'll take a few questions . Elizabeth . Yes , sir , thank you . The American people are in financial crisis now ...

10 , 20 grand , not much . informant 's name was ... nazir . nazir ? first , last ? only . been up north , doin three and change for shakedowns in brighton beach . paroled a couple weeks ago . that 's why you 're all hot and bothered with this now . that , and my doctors say i 'm dyin ' . brighton beach . russian mafia ? nazir 's more of a freelance weasel . he 's not even russian . chechen or something . why are you so focused on nazir ? i think he was the shooter . well , why would he take you out ? why not just rip off the dealers ? he didn 't expect me to be there . i got there early . i didn 't trust his information 100 % . i thought you didn 't see the shooter . it had to be him . he was the only one who knew . was i unclear about my instructions , detective ? no . then what 's all this ? andy 's case file . yeah , i know what it is . why are you working it after i told you not to ? my fault , sarge . i backed him into a corner . traded shamelessly on our friendship . i didn 't think he had any friends . well , i do. him . i 'll give you to the end of the week . if you don 't have anything by then ... thanks , sarge . end of the week . not much time . it 's generous. i may not last even that long . i 'm gonna go rest . hey , call me when you find nazir . you got it . you really are friends . you sound surprised . gives me hope . andy and i . got along great . from day one . ok , where did the blood spatter come from ? it 's not an exit wound . there isn 't one . wanna bet ? shut up and find the slug . that blood didn 't have feet on it . it didn 't walk out of his body and climb up the wall . actually , it did . it expirated . the word is " aspirated , " hotshot . that 's when you breathe it in . expirated . blew out of his mouth and nose . that 's not how we do it . find the slug . come on , search . take a look for yourself . you got lucky . you still got a lot to learn . yeah , nazir 's one of mine . but i 'm carrying 160 cases . it 's always the case load . i got a handful of parolees i 'm trying to track down , and this guy 's one of them . you want us to congratulate you for only losing a few of your cases ? when was the last time you saw him ? right after he got out . his intake interview ? and then you lost him ? so it 's been what , two weeks ? about . you don 't know for sure ? i could violate him . get a warrant . has he violated his parole ? not technically . don 't violate him . find him. do your job . find nazir . so you were andy 's partner at the time . i was. we looked into it every which way . never found the shooter . good looking dog . bayou retriever . you have no idea who . a stick-up . turf war . rival gun runners . we went down all the roads . andy 's dying . i know . i 'm sorry to hear that . i wish i could give him an answer , but there isn 't one . andy thinks this snitch has- - nazir , nazir , nazir . it 's a broken record . now he 's got you playing the tune . like i didn 't check him out in the first place . i spent hours on nazir . hours. nothin ' . you know andy . a dog with a bone . right , pup ? where do you think you 're going ? thought i 'd go look for the guy the witnesses said killed him . by yourself ? i don 't think so , lone ranger . catching ' bad guys , andy . that 's the job . i know what the job is . it 's not flyin ' solo , being reckless , goin ' off half-cocked , tryin ' to be a hero . there 's a reason they give you a partner . you ok ? i 'm fine . this is where it went down . ok . walk us through it , so we can take you home . i 'm not dead yet . i didn 't say you were . i was busting these two bandidos when somebody ambushed us . nypd. hands in the air . you tried to apprehend them by yourself ? my partner was in court , processing a perp through the system that night . you couldn 't wait for backup ? tip was hot . catching ' bad guys , that 's the job . right , john ? this guy goes off the reservation , they give him a medal . not only that . i get to ride shotgun , too . andrew . where have you been ? greenpoint . look , andy , go inside lay down . ok ? i 'll be up in a minute . thanks. i get carsick in the back . he wanted to show us what happened . he got shot . he 's dying . that 's what happened . didi. he asked me to find out why . i couldn 't say no . i only have a few days left with him . that 's all i care about now . why does all the rest of this matter so much ? are you still working ? not getting any traction . three in the morning . i just finished closing out . can 't stop . time 's running out . andy ? he 's dying . right in front of my eyes . i 'm sorry to hear that . you were a mess , that first year on the force . so angry . about what had happened to your city . knockin ' down doors , takin ' names . andy pulled you through . he was always worried i 'd get myself killed . little did he know , huh ? it 's ironic . he 's dying and i 'm finally starting to feel ... mortal ? something 's definitely going on with sara . well , if she really is the one ... time ... feels more ... important ? lighter . not so endless . like there might be less of it for me . been thinking about death a lot . and for the first time ... it scares me . welcome to the human condition . like the man said . everybody wants to go to heaven , but nobody wants to die . i told you , my cousin mikhail , i don 't know what happened to him that night . that 's ok . i love shooting . he 's so good at this . the monkey . he 's callin my name . i told other police . i don 't know what mikhail was doing when he got killed . you didn 't know he was selling guns ? i didn 't know he was selling guns . this is like noah 's ark . almost like there 's a trick to it . i know how all the flats are gaffed . you are carny , not cop . i 've been both . sometimes i can 't tell the difference . promise , you don 't come back ? you cannot say who told you . mikhail and sasha , they worked for viktor brodsky . viktor brodsky . thank you . why would a player like viktor brodsky be involved in a nickel and dime arms deal ? well , maybe it wasn 't nickel and dime . it 's gonna be hard to get to . you 're right . maybe we should just give up . it 's a great idea . we 're looking for your boss . not here . they had dog racing around here . right down the block . back in 1879 . no dog racing here . we are closed . you know these guys ?

oops . we ran the names by organized crime . they didn 't make the connection either . as far as we know , they were freelancers . they were working for brodsky . and skimming behind his back ? kills them without blinking . brodsky ? i don 't care about brodsky . nazir worked for brodsky once in a while . everyone out there works for brodsky . maybe nazir tipped brodsky . nazir shot me . nazir . not brodsky. nazir . we 'll find him , andy . better find him soon . you guys ok ?

one million , or so . not much . still . sets a bad example . i didn 't kill them . i would have. someone else got there first . how did you know what they were doing that night ? confidential informant . nazir ? nazir sells sasha and mikhail to me , to your detective friend , and maybe to someone else . the shooter . three times , same information . only in america . my friend thinks nazir was the shooter . not nazir i know . you let me go now . i promise i won 't kill you here . bad for business . you are dead man . how does it feel ? ah ! where did you come from ? what the hell are you doing ? you coulda got killed . i coulda been killed . thank you . i didn 't do it for you . i did it for me . i lost too many friends when those towers came down last year . went to too many damn funerals . damned if i 'm going to yours . officer request backup . you could 've got yourself killed . maybe i could have . i thought we were partners . we are . brodsky told us there was real money involved that night . those guys were selling junk outta the trunk of their car . handguns , ak 47s . i was there . you sure ?

if you had six months to live . i went into remission . it was a miracle . when was this ? the remission ? yeah . oh , a couple months after andy got shot . now he 's the sick one . and i 'm fine . except i 'm not fine without him . i know . sometimes i think he loves me so much that he figured out how to take my cancer away and give it to himself . i 'd do that for him if i could . was this before he went to firearms investigation ? well , it had to be , because you two were partners at the time . he never said a word . i asked him not to . andy was more upset than i was , i think . he spent hours researching , drugs , treatments , anything that would give us more time . did he find anything ? found a doctor in brazil , but our insurance company wouldn 't cover it . how 's gleason ? can 't do anything else for him . how long now ? a few days , at the outside . i 'm sorry . yeah . i know you promised him . i 'm gonna go through the case file , see if there 's anything else i can find . thanks. amsterdam . one of my snitches spotted nazir near the mermaid museum . ever been on it ?

it is not proper for a woman to be alone with man who is not blood relative or husband . don 't think of me as a woman . that would be hard . i can smell your perfume . don 't think about that . think of me as a police officer . think of me as the person who 's sending you back to prison . it would be safer for me in prison . who are you afraid of ? brodsky ? he said there was a lot of money in play that night . this was no nickel and dime street corner deal . a million dollars . i don 't know nothing . please . tell us what you know . we 'll protect you . you can 't protect me . andy gleason thinks you were the shooter . i have alibi for that night . alibi . brodsky said you tipped off someone else . no. i want lawyer . you don 't get a lawyer . you 're a convicted felon in possible violation of his parole . i 'm not . you can 't hold me . he 's terrified . when you mentioned the money , he almost had a stroke . he 's scared of brodsky . he 's scared of someone . i 'm gonna check out nazir 's alibi for the night of the shooting . ok , you 're scared of heights . i 'm fine . job like this , you gotta find a place to cool out , get some perspective . nothin ' to be ashamed of . i 'm not scared . too bad . if you were , this would be extra good . remind you you 're actually not bulletproof . up here , everything fades away . time , other people , the world . just the size of everything . this job , we get haunted . we see the worst things , we get taken over . forget about a whole career . i 've seen it happen to guys in a second . last september ... even if you are actually bulletproof , you need a partner . that 's my point . i know you , andy . you never would 've gone in without your partner . didi got sick . you needed money . you transferred outta homicide to flu . guns , cash. a chance for a big score . you went there to rip those guys off , not bust them . she was dying , john . you would have done the same thing , you had somebody you cared about that much . maybe i do . then you must understand what i did . you gonna arrest me ? for what ? trying to rip off some russian gun runners ? is it gonna come out ? well , if we catch the shooter , it will . i 'll lose my pension . didi will have nothing . maybe you shouldn 't have stirred this pot . i 'm dyin ' . want a little justice . catch the guy who shot me . come on , andy . you wanted the money . nazir got popped right after the heist . you went to prison . you thought maybe you could get it back . leave it for didi . andy . that money must be long gone by now . a man can dream . amsterdam . it 's nazir . ? close range . through and through . csu 's on the way . i remember when there was no csu . of course you do . you looking for the slug ? good luck . let 's see if it matches the one in andy 's chest . is it a match ? looking through the case file , i found something . something that should have been there but wasn 't . nazir 's alibi . you 're sure ? it isn 't there . williams said he spent hours with him . so , it got me thinking . about who was where that night . thanks for meeting us out here . no problem . you said you had a break in the case ? you heard nazir got popped ? we found the slug . now all you need is the gun to match it with . longshot , right ? needle , haystack . for some reason i 'm feeling optimistic about that . andy . detective . marquez . jeez , andy , you look rough . you look fat and sassy . can 't complain . ok. you lured me out here . off my death bed . so where 's nazir ? nazir 's dead . dead ? how ? somebody shot him . what am i doing here ? where 's the guy who shot me ? you 're looking at him . him . what ? what kind of crap is this ? you were the shooter , joe . the stick up guy . you took everybody down . nypd. hands in the air . you were my partner . that 's right . i was . well , come on , andy . you know me . you ripped me off . they 're lying . you weren 't in court that night . you removed nazir 's alibi from the case file . pretty thin . thick enough for a search warrant . we find your gun , we 'll have ballistics , too . the slug in andy 's chest , nazir , the two shooters . where 's my money ? easy , andy . it was for my wife . she was dying . where 's my money , joe ? it 's gone . i spent it . i 'm sorry , andy . i didn 't want to shoot you . i was just trying to make a score . i didn 't know you 'd get there first . you really want to kill him ? go ahead , andy . now 's your chance . you 're never gonna answer for it . not in this world . that 's right . didi will . he 's a piece of trash . he betrayed me . he 's still your partner . cleaned in the last 24 hours . thanks . you 're not the only detective around here with mad skills . i know . look familiar ? found it at your house . it 's on its way to ballistics . let 's go . my worst nightmare . a cop , in prison ? the gift that keeps on giving . so , andy ? take you home ? i 'll never see this again . one more favor . gotta ask you something . didi . whatever she needs . you know i 'll take care of it . i know . had to say it . make sure . still scared of heights . a little bit . me , too . i always was . that 's why this is my plac the fear . keeps you in the moment . in the moment . focused . you 're right . up here , everything fades away . turn back the hands of time . aren 't you curious ? what i just dropped in the mail ? i figured you 'd tell me if i needed to know . divorce papers . seriously ? signed , sealed , and delivered . you 're a free woman . very . that calls for a celebration . how 's it feel ?

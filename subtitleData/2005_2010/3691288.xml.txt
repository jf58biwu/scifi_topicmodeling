 That will take you directly to who has the sword , and that will lead you ... to Macpherson . - Who ? - Who ? I wasn 't here when everything went down between Artie and Macpherson , but I know it was bad . It 's called the past rearing its ugly head . And someone out there is running around using the ... That someone is Macpherson . He wanted more than the sword . He wanted to mess us up as a team . Now it 's up to you to stop him . Hello , Arthur . Aah ! Done ! I win ! Ha ha ha ha ! It 's not a race . Ooh , said the tortoise to the hare . You know , in the story , the tortoise actually wins . It 's a fairy tale . How is a turtle gonna beat a rabbit ? It 's not a fairy tale . It 's a fable , a life lesson . Slow and steady wins the race . Okay , here 's a life lesson : Pete fast , Pete win . You all finished ? - Oh , hey , hey , Artie , Artie . - Yeah . If you were making a bet , who 's faster , a turtle or a rabbit ? Yeah , you finished the report ? Yeah . Who are these going to ? Not Mrs. Frederic . Yeah , she doesn 't seem like the paperwork type . No , these go above all our pay grades . Who ? Myka , one day you will know all answers to all questions , just not today . Okay , fine . Enjoy your top secrets . I just got to go . I just can 't leave that courier waiting . What ? A courier ? What is this , the wells fargo wagon ? Haven 't you ever heard of email ? No , no , no , that 's not nearly secure enough , because we ... it doesn 't matter . You guys are having a day to yourselves , right ? Have fun . Claudia 's doing chores . - And I 'll see you later . - Doing chores where ? Uh , in the warehouse . Scalpel . Thank you , nurse . There 's an awful lot of blood . I think I need some suction . Ha ha ! Ganza ! Good as new . And get into the corners this time . Don 't make me push you . Go on . Ew . Warm . Mmm . Ahh . Frosty goodness . What else ? Okay , " repair auto-vac . " Slice-o-pie . " Tighten and lubricate zip line . " Sounds kind of dirty when you say it like that . God , ancient junk-oleum . You got to update this turd someday , Artie . Hey ... Be careful ! Oh ! Oh ! No , no , no , no ! Crap ! Crappity , crap , crap , crap ! Oh , my God ! This is not good ! This is not gonna look good on my report card ! Oh , my God . Okay , don 't panic . Oh , that 's far . Oh , w.w.a.d ... . what would Artie do ? Um ... Momentum ! Got to get momentum . All right . Come on , momentum . Let 's go ! No , no , no , no , no , no . This sucks ! So if it isn 't Mrs. Frederic , then who 's getting those reports ? I don 't know , Mr. Frederic ? Claudia ! I brought doughnuts . Doughnut . - Chocolate . - Mmm . - What 's " a.d. " ? - Artifact disturbance . You know , you really need to read the manual . That can 't be good . Claudia ? Um , I 'm sorry . I was just wondering ... I was hoping that you could take a message to the higher-ups for me . This Macpherson situation ... I realize that they prefer a hands-off approach but ... You 're talking . - We don 't talk . - Oh . Well , I didn 't think that was a rule . I just thought you weren 't particularly social . I see I was right about that . Oh , God . Hi . She would like a word . I 'm sure she would . Let 's just follow the zip line . She 's bound to turn up . I just hope she 's okay , you know ? Claudia 's like bamboo . You can bend her all you want , but she 'll never break . - This is hers . - How do you know ? We have to get rid of Artie 's bedazzler . - Hello . - Mmm . Is that a dodgeball ? - How did that get in here ? - I don 't ... Ooh ! Oh , oh , oh ... Hell , no . Um , d ... d ... did that just do what I think it did ? Ow ! - Yeah , yeah . - Gosh . Is that thing having babies or ... ? Yeah . Look . - Okay , let 's get out of here . - Okay . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Those things ... those things hit us every time we look away . Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm gonna go with you on that , so I don 't end up with a concussion . Um , ooh , uh , the screen . - What ? Oh . Yes . - Right ? Let 's ... let 's ... let 's read the screen . " Baylor dodgeball . Used for military dexterity and agility training . Multiplies upon contact . " That we already know . " Acquired after the ... bludgeoning deaths of five cadets in 1972 . " Uh , uh , bludgeoning is b ... bad . Agreed . Agreed . Okay , there 's a neutralizing station around the corner . - There ... there should be . - Ah , okay . Okay , okay , okay , okay , okay . - Ready ? On three . - Okay . Three ! Let 's see how these puppies like a neutralizer flea bath . Ha ha ! Errrrr ! What ... why isn 't it working ? Okay , this is bad . What 's happening ? - Why isn 't it working ? - I don 't know . It 's busted . Okay , what do we do now ? - Plan " b . " - What 's ... what 's plan " b " ? - I was hoping that you knew . - No . Okay , wait . Uh ... What 's that one ? " Breathe underwater . " - " Hear colors . " - Okay , uh ... - " Grow fingernails fast . " - " Summon locusts . " Ugh . That 's not ... They 're dodgeballs . Yes , yes , that 's already established . That 's how you win at dodgeball . You have to ... you have to catch it . No , these are too fast . And what about that whole " death by bludgeoning " thing ? No , no , no , no , look . You look away , right ? And when they go for you , I 'll catch one . I think we should go with plan " c " . What 's plan " c " ? Well , I run away , and you get pummeled . Look ! Pete ? Pete ? Ha ha ha ha ! - God ! - Ha ha ha ha ! Who smells like tuna fish now , Ralph Brunsky ? Who ? Huh ? Who ? Oh , I was just ... Uh , I was having a little playground flashback . Ah . Hi , there. welcome to Ted 's . I 'm Theadora , but everybody calls me Ted . Party of one ? Uh , no , no , I 'm meeting that woman right over there . And it 's rarely a party . Hello . Oh , Arthur , have a seat . Uh , why are we meeting here ? We need to have a chat . Pie of the day is banana cream . I highly recommend it . Made it myself . Uh , steak , bloody , black coffee , two pieces of the pie . Two ? um ... just a house salad . Leena 's got me on a diet . Uh , maybe just one piece of that pie , please . She made it herself . How are things at the warehouse ? They 're good . They 're fine . A little chaotic , but it 's a good kind of chaos . And the missions ? No one 's been killed . You can 't ask for more than that . And we have an excellent retrieval rate . What about the incidents in Paris or Las Vegas or Colorado ? Mrs. Frederic , you know all about those . Why are you asking me about them ? I 'm forgetful . Refresh my memory . You were saying about Paris ? Claudia , there 's half a doughnut in the office . How far do you think she could 've gotten before the zip line snapped ? Could be the other end of the warehouse . There 's an end ? I hope so . Duck and cover . Okay , that was bigger than usual . To hell with this . I 'm gonna see if I can spot her from up here . Well , be careful . - Whoa . - What is it ? Go down the aisle , cross two over , and turn right . It 's Leena 's . But how ? And there 's a Claudia-shaped hole in the roof . - Claudia ? - Are you here ? - Wait , you guys ... No , no , no , no , no , don 't ... don 't close the ... door . Thank God you 're ... we were following the zip line , and the ... and the ... Yeah , no , I 'm good . I mean , we 're all trapped in here for eternity , but , uh , otherwise I 'm solid . Okay ... Well , let 's just get back to the office , so we can fix the ... What ? What ? W ... w ... what the hell ? This is what I 've been saying . - First the goo doesn 't work . - Mm-hmm . Then one of those static balls tries to cook us . - Mm-hmm . - And now a clingy house . The warehouse is in a bad mood today . Um , fyi , if anyone has to use the bathroom , don 't flush . - Ooh . - Trust me . Okay , you know what ? Just ... we just have to wait and ... and think about this for a second . New plan . Ooh , scoring that an 8.5 . Next time you got to ... umph ... stick the landing . Let 's all just ... stop and think about this a second . That 's a good plan . Claudia , did you try climbing back out of the same hole that you fell in ? Yeah . Came right back in through the fireplace . I don 't recommend it . - And you trust Pete and Myka ? - With my life . They 're consummate professionals . Mrs. Frederic , I have to ask you , why , specific ... excuse me . We 're having a private ... do you mind ? Oh , no . That 's all right . What is he ... Very sorry . Private party . Wait , what is ... what is going on ? I thought they would never leave . Okay , here we go . You be careful , now . This is a hot plate . I think we can begin . Mr. Valda . Hello , Irene . Mr. Valda , nice to see you again . This is Agent Nielsen . Just ... just ... just ... just a minute . What is this ? That 's a house salad . Bering and Lattimer are consummate professionals . Thank you , Theadora . So as you stated in the past , Agents Bering and Lattimer 's mission ... Do you mind telling me exactly what is happening here ? Arthur , Mr. Valda 's asking the questions . Please don 't interrupt him . Yeah , well , I don 't think I 'm gonna be answering any questions until you tell me what this is about . Sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority . What higher authori ... Ty ? The regents . These are the regents ? The regents meet here ? They do today . You really expect me to believe that ... What exactly were you expecting , Agent Nielsen ? Hooded , cloaked figures standing in half-light around a perpetually burning flame ? He 's seen too many movies . I ... You know , I just would have thought that ... This waitress is a regent ? John Adams was a farmer . Abraham Lincoln was a small-town lawyer . Plato , socrates were teachers . Jesus was a carpenter . To equate judgment and wisdom with occupation is at best ... insulting . Yeah , that 's not ... w ... what I meant ... I know what you meant . Who would you have control the warehouse ? Kings ? Popes ? Politicians ? There 'd be nothing left of it . No , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . - It 's just , I didn 't think ... - Yes . That 's one of the reasons we needed to speak with you . Your reluctance to think . - Irene ... - Mrs. Frederic . Thank you , Theadora . So as I was saying , you stated in the past that agents Bering and Lattimer 's mission was to snag it , bag it , and tag it . Correct ? Yeah , well , you know , I mean , I ... I said that . I didn 't mean to denigrate the job description . Yet , in their brief tenure as field agents , they managed to destroy James Braid 's chair ... If you just let me explain ... - Lewis Carroll 's mirror . - That wasn 't destroyed . Your agents released a malevolent entity into the warehouse , allowing it access to dangerous artifacts . An accident . It was a total accident . It is not uncommon for artifacts to be occasionally destroyed for the greater good . And agents Lattimer and Bering , I mean , they 've repeatedly shown bravery . They 've shown quick thinking . They 're an excellent team . They 're probably the best agents - that the warehouse has ever had . - Arthur ! Their abilities are not in question here . Oh . This is about me ? Not only you . Your former partner . Macpherson ? Okay , okay , so this version of the bb is in the warehouse because ... Iit 's an artifact . Oh , can this whole place be an artifact ? Like , is that even possible ? Yeah , pretty much anything is possible . So ... so maybe there was an artifact in the original that they couldn 't take out , right ? So ... so they just moved the whole thing . And rebuilt the new one without it . Look for anything here that 's different from our bb . All right ! That was kind of cool . We had this little , like , group-think thing going on . Gold stars all around . Oh , hey , hey , hey , hey ! I do not recognize that chair . You were sleeping in it last week . What about this ugly lamp ? Those lightbulbs burnt out a month ago , but this ... this is new ... or old . It 's fused to the wall . This is it . Huh . It 's a painting of this room . And we can 't leave this room . Seems like quite the coinky-dink , don 't you think ? Yeah , how very Salvador Dali . Do you think this painting 's keeping us here ? Maybe . Pete , look at the lamp . What ? Okay , now look at the painting . Claudia put it back in a different spot . It changed because of what you did . Okay , okay , so maybe if I do something to the picture ... that happens . Sick ! Oh ... After you . Okay . Your turn . Don 't mind if I do . Don 't even bother . At least that was new . Oh , man. you know what ? This thing is useless ! Did I do that ? Well , neither of us did . I can see the warehouse . Okay , um , there 's ... there 's , uh , a letter opener , if I remember ... Yes ! Um , okay . Okay . Let 's go . Oh . All right , safe and sound . - What ? - That . Maybe we should have stayed inside . We need to get back to the office . Oh , no need . " What are you doing wasting time installing backup terminals in the aisle , foolish red-haired girl ? " 'Cause you never know when you might need one , Artie . - Nice . - Hey-o . Okay , looks like the problem is in the gooery . What 's a gooery ? I 'm guessing it 's Claudia-speak for the neutralizer processing center . - Uh-huh . - Right . Of course . Well , it 's chapter 197 in the manual . It 's 1,000 pages long . I 'll wait for the movie . Okay , the neutralizer processing center is what pumps the purple goo through the warehouse , creating a stability field . Yeah , it 's like all the gak in here are nuclear rods , right ? As long as there 's coolant , it 's all good . The gooery jakes out the coolant . It keeps the artifacts from getting all artifacty on their own . Okay , so the gooery ... cool name , by the way ... Uh , needs to go back online . Man with a plan . Okay , so does chapter 198 say what happens if we don 't get it working again ? The same thing that happens to the nuclear rods without the coolant , except probably worse . Yeah , I 'm guessing when we get to 100 % , we have China syndrome . We 've got maybe ... maybe half an hour left . - What 's the fastest way there ? - Let me see . We got to go through aisle Haddonfield-79 , then loop around Carlsbad-22 . No , no , no , no , why ... why don 't we just go straight through here ? 'Cause that 's the dark vault . Ooh . Okay . See , I know what that is . Didn 't read the manual . That 's where all the dangerous stuff is . Yeah , like , mega-dangerous , dude . Mondo . Okay , okay , but we still ... we can 't loop around . - I say we take the risk . - I agree . - it 's not often that I agree , but I agree . Guys , if we 're gonna do this thing , let 's do this thing . Wait , oh , no , no , no , no . You 're not going anywhere , Claudia . You 're gonna stay put . - I 'm coming with . - No , no . We 're the agents . We 're the ones that agreed to risk our lives , not you . Yeah , but this is my home too . You might need my help . She 's right . She has read the manual . Am I never gonna hear the end of that ? She knows this place , okay ? - I say that she comes with . - Please ? Okay , fine , but you stick close . - And you do exactly as we say . - All right . Suicide mission with the team . Kind of exciting . I 'm excited . Come on ! And in attempting to save Joshua Donovan , you placed his sister ... yet another civilian ... in danger . I 'm sorry . Excuse me , please . If this is about Macpherson , then why am I being asked about cases that have absolutely nothing to do with Macpherson ? Agent Nielsen , I will ask the questions . It might be wise to let this run its course for now . All right , fine . Fine . Ye ... yes . Yes . In saving Joshua , I maybe put Claudia in da ... a little danger . - But I promised her that if ... - You promised ? You promised ? Sounds as if personal feelings became involved in professional judgment . This has been an issue in the past , has it not ? It may have come up . But his artifact-retrieval rate is excellent . - It 's the highest in years . - Thank you . Simply the facts . Very well , then . The facts . Thank you , Theadora . Did you or did you not on two separate occasions involve Daniel Dickinson , a high-ranking secret service officer , in warehouse 13 matters , all of which were classified at the highest level ? Yes . We have a unique relationship with the united states government ... a relationship that your actions have now complicated . I contacted a fellow government official in the normal course of performing my job , a job to which I have dedicated the last 40 years of my life . No one 's questioning your dedication , Arthur . What we are questioning , Agent Nielsen , is your future . Oh , it 's sealed with an omega level security code . Can you hack it ? Pope , catholic . Bear , woods . You know the drill . And ... Done . Man , this place is creep-tastic . Okay , don 't ... don 't look . Don 't touch . Just keep moving . These objects are so dangerous they can only be controlled by purple containment fields . Why are the neutralizer systems still working in here ? Backup generators , 'cause everything 's so dangerous . Don 't worry , they should hold up long enough for us to ... Realize my karma sucks . We 're starting to lose them . Just ... just keep moving . Oh , this is gonna take me a minute . Is it a different code ? Yeah , I got to use an ftl-ascii binary algorithm . Hey , little guy . What you in for ? Almost there . Hang in there , guys . And ... We 're good . Okay , let 's go . Pete ? Pete ? Pete ? Pete , what are you ... - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Wait , wait , wait , wait ! - Pete ! - Crap ! - Pete ! - Pete , what are you doing ? Pete , can you hear me ? Pete , are you okay ? Pete ! Pete , are you okay ? Attention , warehouse agents . Mrs. Frederic . Thank God . Emergency evacuation required . Repeat , emergency evacuation required . Mrs. F , we 're down here . Energy levels approaching critical mass . That 's a recording . - Ohh ... - Yeah . Emergency evacuation required . That 's the most I 've ever heard her say . I know . Well , this is a whole nother code level . It 's gonna take me a few minutes . You know what ? Step aside . Just stand over there . Emergency evacuation required . Whoa ! Okay , that was flat-out awesome . Pete , what are you doing , man ? We got to go . Wait ! Wait ! Stop , stop , stop ! The circle ... I think it 's there for a reason . Right ? Pete , what you doing ? Oh , nothing . He 's looking at a typewriter . It 's not just any typewriter . It 's , um , Sylvia Plath 's . she wrote this poem called Ennui , and ultimately she took her own life in a ... Myka , I spent some serious time in the bell jar . I know who Sylvia Plath is . Right . What 's that thing doing to him ? It 's sucking the life out of him . We have to get him out of the containment field . Pete ? Pete , can you come here ? Why ? What 's the point ? What do we do ? There 's no time . Okay , you go up to the gooery , get it online . I 'll stay here and deal with this . What , like , just on my own or ... ? Yeah . Claudia , you know this warehouse , okay ? I ... I trust you . Right . Yeah . No , I 'll just ... - Go . - I 'll do it , then . Get going . Tick tock . I have a few more questions . Do you ? Really ? Yeah , I ... I have a few of my own . Arthur , don 't do anything foolish . This exercise is a pointless and insulting waste of time . I asked you not to do this . If Macpherson is out there ... What ? If ? I ... if ? If ? I have a wound right here ... right here in my shoulder that should prove it . He 's out there . Oh , he 's out there . And he 's planning something far worse than any of you can imagine . What are you doing about it ? What are you doing ? You 're tying my hands ! You leave us no choice . You say Macpherson is a threat . And you use that to justify violating warehouse protocol time and time again . Pretty soon , y ... you 're gonna be making up your own rules just to sanction your actions . Does that sound familiar , Agent Nielsen , huh ? Sound like someone we both knew ? Mr. Valda , he knows the rules . He knows that I 'm forced to follow them . Don 't you see that ? And if I 'm gonna take Macpherson ... and I am ... then rules have to be broken . That 's the only thing that 'll work . You know what 's not gonna work ? Reining in the one person that can stop him before it 's too late . Look at all of you . You 're not out in the field ! You 're here , hiding in plain sight . What are you doing ? You 're judging me . You 're judging my methods , because ... you 're af ... afraid of him . - Tell me I 'm wrong . - Arthur ... No , no , no , no , no . Mr. Valda , look at me . You tell me right to my face ... tell me I 'm wrong . Yeah , well ... either fire me or kill me or let me do my job . You better make a decision , and you better make it fast before he makes it for you . I believe the ball is in your court . Okay , Pete , we 're running out of time here , so ... Okay , look , what I 'm gonna do , I 'm gonna take off my belt , all right ? I 'm gonna throw it to you . You grab it , and I 'll pull you out of there , okay , Pete ? Whatever . Okay , grab the belt . Pete , grab the belt . Pete , grab it . Grab the belt ! Okay . You 're a rabbit , right ? Pete , you 're not a tortoise , so win , win the race . Just ... just grab it . Win , lose ... what 's the diff ? Okay . Warehouse , give me something . Give me something ... Thank you . Okay . Pete . Oh ! Aah ! You again . Are you okay ? Yeah . What was that ? Okay , listen , we 're running out of time . The warehouse is about to explode . Okay , so just ... come on . Critical mass in five minutes . Critical mass in five minutes . Really ? Cliche much ? Ew . Gross . Oh . Ew . Uhh . Well , it 's not so bad . It kind of smells like chicken . Critical mass in four minutes . - Are you okay ? - I 'm okay . I 'm just a little drained , that 's all . You go . Go ahead . I 'll ... I 'll catch up . - Are you sure ? - Yeah , yeah . You go . - Okay . - Go . Myka . Yeah ? Thank you . Okay , ugly , I 'm just gonna pull you out . Oh , this is slippery . Okay . Gloves are coming off . Oh . Yeah . Eesh ! Now I want italian food . No , no . Not the plan . Nope . Critical mass in three minutes . - Claudia ? - Myka ! Hey , I know it looks like I 'm having a bunch of fun , but help ! Almost there . - No , no , no . Don 't touch . - What ? Way too sticky . No point in us both getting ground up . Okay . What is this stuff ? If I remember properly , it 's hours of fun for the whole family . - Okay . - Aah ! Oh ! No ! Oh , they lied . It 's not even minutes of fun , really . Where 's Pete ? Still bored out of his mind ? No , he 'll be here in a minute . Just keep pulling . Critical mass in two minutes . Mind if I yell ? I 'm gonna yell . - Pete ! - Critical mass in two minutes . Pete , help ! Pete ! Chicks ! Pete , hey , you have to find something to cut this stuff ! By " stuff , " you don 't mean our arms , right ? - No . Don 't touch it ! - Don 't touch it ! - It 's sticky . - Attention , warehouse agents , energy levels are now at omega level . - Critical mass in one minute . - We 're boned . How much time did she just say ? 50 seconds . See ? See ? Even on tape , she still ... Pete , just please go find something ! - Okay , okay , I 'm gonna go look . - Wait . My tool belt . - What ? - Right there . - Get the snow globe . - Okay . Ha ! I got it . Hey , hey , hey . Use it to freeze the gears . - Pete ! - Oh , oh ! I got a better idea . Hold on ! - Hold on . Hold on . - 30 seconds . All right , you guys got to pull really hard . - Yes ! - Right ... Now ! Attention , warehouse agents , emergency abated . - Nice work . - Thank you . God , this is a weird job . Oh . God . How do you do that ? That was quite a performance . Sounded better in my head . So am I fired ? Worse . They want you to stay . Bering and Lattimer are not the best agents we 've ever had . - You are . - They said that ? It was said . And they were smart enough to believe me . Oh . Thanks . Simply the fact . What about Macpherson ? Good hunting . Try not to get yourself killed . No , no , no . Don 't try to be all friendly with me now . - Um , uh , hey , Myka ? - Yeah ? I just wanted to say thanks for , um , you know , trusting me before . Claudia , I ... I know what it 's like to be your age and have no one believe in you . Yeah . You 're good . No , you 're really good . You 'll be fine . Thanks . Hey , um , you know , if you 're not busy later , maybe you could show me how to do that ... ka-cha ... kick thing , 'cause , like , I tried it on a light switch , and I think I broke my toe . And I know I broke the light switch . That ... that would be ... that would be fun , you know ? And maybe you could teach me how to hack into the ... - The grid ? - Yeah . - You want to hack the grid ? - I want to hack the grid . Okay . Yeah , I 'm down . Okay , so I cleaned up the last of the mess . You know , I bet Artie won 't even notice . Won 't notice what ? Your welcome-back surprise party . - Whee ! - Aah , surprise ! You look surprised . Doesn 't he look surprised ? Tell me . The zip line crashed , and there were these dodgeballs ... and some glop got in the gooery gears . We went to the dark vault ... - things got sparky ... We fixed it . We fixed it . - We fixed everything . - Good as new . - It 's all fixed . - Totally . How long did you have before the warehouse was gonna explode ? - Under a minute . - More like 30 seconds . That 's lucky . I once got there with 17 , and her voice gets really annoying when she 's counting down seconds one at a time . You didn 't lose that thing I had made for you , did you ? The ... - oh , no . - oh. great . - it survived . - That 's good . - Yay . Wait , are we not in trouble ? You guys had it under control , right ? That we did , amigo . That we did . All right , I don 't know about you guys , but I 'm starving . Who wants mexican ? I do . Need tacos stat . Myka , ¿ tu venga ? ¿ Por que no ? Artie ? Uuh , no , I had pie . Well , I almost had pie . But go , go , go . Enjoy yourselves . Enjoy yourselves . - Now I want pie . - You always want pie . Who doesn 't want pie ? Uh , maybe just bring me one taco ? Whatever . and rest up ... because you 're gonna need it .

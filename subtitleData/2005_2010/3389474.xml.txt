 Previously on heroes ... You had to go and be the detective , Didn 't you , matt ? Now that you know , you can 't be here . No ! This girl found me , Said I should go to this company , pinehearst . There 's a chance That these people at pinehearst can help us . You don 't have your powers anymore , peter . Because I have them now . I 'm sorry , peter. this is something I have to do . You help him , you 're proving All the worst things I 've ever said about you . Just kick his ass , and let 's get out of here . I 'm not going anywhere , peter . You are . You can 't heal . How did you fall that far and not die ? Now that they think we 're dead , We have time to get away . No . I told you . I 'm not running . There 's a company , primatech- - They know how to deal with situations like this . If anybody can help , they can . It worked . He thinks I 'm on his side . Hello , angela . You can see the future . I can 't have that . That 's too dangerous . Dad 's dead . He 's not. he 's alive . I need to know where he is . Pinehearst . Pinehearst , the biotech firm ? How do you know about pinehearst ? I 've been taking a consultant fee from them For over a year . I can open doors . I don 't need any doors opened . I plan on kicking ' em down . I 'm ready to begin my spirit walk . I understand you 've been dreaming about me . When the moon passes Between the sun and the earth , A strange fascination Takes root in the heart . And suddenly , anything is possible . Its power is undeniable . Its beauty mesmerizing . Its lure biblical . Its meaning unknowable . And as quickly as it comes , It disappears , Leaving us to dwell on our own insignificance In the face of god . I understand you 've been dreaming about me . I can 't have that . That 's too dangerous . I will completely wipe out your memory . Hiro ! Leave my friend alone ! You had one job to do , And now I have to come clean up your mess . That 's what I get for sending a boy to do a man 's job . Still hard to believe peter survived that fall Without his powers . Yeah , I was just thinking that myself . Come . I have something to show you . Where are you taking me ? It 's time I started acting like your father , gabriel . That hunger you 've got , it 's not about killing , It 's about power . You can take all the abilities you want Without killing . I can teach you . How ? By accessing your empathy , That part of your heart I know is there . You 've had this power all along . Empathy . What makes you think I 'm capable of that ? Because I know you 're the one That saved peter from that fall . You . - We have to get out of here . - I know . But you 're not coming with me . What ? I 'm gonna go someplace where they can 't find me . And you 're gonna go home . Peter , I have to protect you . I can protect myself , claire . How ? you don 't have your powers . Your father 's trying to kill you . Look , this isn 't your fight . I need you to stay ... Stay what ? Innocent . Fire escape. run ! - I 'll hold ' em off . - claire . I have a plan. go . You 're never gonna find him . Aw , that 's cute. she 's protecting him . Don 't you know ? I 'm the defensive player of the year . Come on ! Told you I had a plan . Yeah . What 's wrong ? They 're coming. come on . We should keep moving . Any luck yet ? If you call this luck ? What went wrong ? I don 't know . I 'm beginning to think it 's impossible To give people abilities without an adverse reaction . He 's a human being for god 's sakes . I see we share a fascination . It seems most of the powers I 've documented Took place during the last total-annular eclipse . It 's probably just a coincidence . I thought I had successfully combined my findings With yours . I mean , theoretically , this formula is sound , But the serum is triggering a mutation Because something is missing . Something ? Some kind of catalyst that allows the proteins From the serum to bond with the enzymes Produced by each individual 's adrenals . Then you 'll just have to keep looking . It 's not that simple . The key component of this catalyst would be something That couldn 't be stored or created synthetically . Meaning what ? Meaning it would live in a human host . You 're saying this catalyst isn 't something . It 's someone . Kaito . I 'm sorry ? My former colleague , kaito nakamura . He hid it . Just not well enough . I will kill you , you son of a bitch . You murdered my father ! Yes , I did . How could you do that to me ? I 'm not gonna insult you by saying I 'm sorry . You deserve so much more than that , elle . You deserve vengeance . I 'll take whatever you 've got . I thought you said there were people who could help us here . There were . Where 'd they all go ? It 's like a ghost town . Who is that ? Her name is , uh , angela petrelli . Petrelli . - What 's wrong with her ? - I don 't know . Mrs. petrelli . What is it ? what did you see ? I gotta help her . I better get a nurse . Didn 't expect you so soon . Matt parkman 's at primatech . He 's trying to help your wife . Did you do that to her ? Mrs. petrelli will be fine . Can we leave matt out of this ? You know , if you 're unhappy , I can always arrange for you To go back to your previous life . Just tell me what I 'm supposed to do . Stay with parkman . And if he tries to help your wife ? Then I 'll be waiting . Okay , we 'll go and then we 'll separate . Separate ? I told you. you have to go home . I 'm not going home , peter . You still have a chance , claire . I left home so I could fight these people , And I have . I can protect myself now . I can protect you . That 's the problem . What 's this all about ? Look , that alley back there , That 's where you kill me . What ? In the future , you find me , And you shoot me . Twice. right in the chest . What are you talking about ? why would I do that ? Because what you 're becoming is a killer . And I 'm trying really hard to make sure That future that I saw does not come true . And I don 't know if I can do it . Because everything that happens , Everything , you 're still becoming this woman who- - Who what ? Who kills you ? Stop saying that . Claire , just go home . Please . No . It 's not gonna happen . And it 's all your fault . You should have never come to odessa to save me . You should have never become my friend or my hero . And now I can 't leave you Because I have a favor to return . Run . Go . You want him , you 're gonna have to go through me . You can 't fight it , claire . How do you know my name ? Oh , ' cause we didn 't come for peter . We came for you . No ! Get off of me ! No ! No ! let me go ! superhero ? I couldn 't find anyone . There 's no one here . I gotta try and get inside her head . See if I can unlock what 's holding her . Is that safe ? Can you get hurt ? I 've only done it one other time . With my dad . How 'd that work out ? What do you need me to do ? Just stay here and keep an eye on me , okay ? I might disappear for a while . In there . But I 'll be back . I 'll be okay . Just knowing that you 're here 's gonna help . Matt ? Can you hear me ? Murderer ! Murderer ! I didn 't want to kill him . I didn 't want to kill any of them . You know that . You saved my life. remember , elle ? You know the pain I feel over this . The urge. but I 'm not gonna let it control me . Not anymore . I 'll kill you , I swear to god ! I 'll kill you , I swear to god ! I will kill you ! I understand . You need to let it out . The anger . The betrayal . You can take it out on me . I can take it all . Go ahead . Kill me . Please . There was a wide spot up in the road . In the berkshires . My father used to take my brother and me fishing there When we were kids . It was called pinehearst . Nathan , are you sure You want to do this ? If he 's alive , Maybe there 's a reason he hasn 't contacted you . I need to know the truth . Everything I 've ever done in my life Has been because of my father . I went to law school to be like him . I married the girl he wanted me to . I ran for office Because he couldn 't . If he 's alive , I 've gotta see him . My god . Good to see you too , Nathan . Come give your dad a hug . You must be miss strauss . I must be . You have any idea What you 've done to this family ? What you 've done to me ? Hindsight being 20 / 20 , I should have told you sooner What your role was in all of this . My role ? Would you excuse us , please ? My son and I need to talk alone . Absolutely . Take a hard look at the last couple of weeks Of your life , and you will see that role Coming into focus . The assassination , linderman , The senate seat . All part of your destiny . That was all you . You were born with a talent , nathan . A talent to lead a nation . This is the same crap linderman spouted . I 'm not falling for it again . Because ... last time , it was new york That was destroyed , and this time , It would be the world , right ? Look around you . It 's already happening . And I 've got the formula that will stop it . You 're insane . I am not afraid to admit That you have always been my favorite son , The one most like me . The strong one . We can save the world together . This can be our legacy , nathan , For the petrelli name . I am offering you this chance . As your father . Kill me . Take my power. that 's what you want . Kill me , and make the pain stop . I wanna make it stop , elle . But I 'm not gonna kill you . Please just do it . I 'm sorry . I wanna be a good person . You 're a monster . Like me . No , your father made you this way , Just like my mother made me . We we never good enough for them , elle . You never meant to be this way . You wanted to be normal . You just didn 't know how . You saved my life once , elle . You gave me the will to live . Don 't you see I owe you ? I only saved you so we could use you . Like a lab rat . You were just following orders . But I forgive you . Now you need to forgive yourself . The pain . It 's gone . Oh , my god . Let me go ! no ! You 've got two choices . Let her go , or you die . You and what army ? Peter , what are you doing ? I don 't need an army to kick your ass , flint . I can do that all by myself . Don 't even need my powers . Stop ! Gas . Claire , run ! No one 's ever done anything like that for me before . You forgave yourself , elle . We 're all at war with ourselves . That 's what it means to be human . The trick is figuring out how to be on the winning side . You wanna try ? Clearly , I don 't have it figured out yet . Let me show you a few tricks . You aim . Then go like this . That 's good . This time , loosen up . You know ? give it some attitude . Some english . That 's really good . Keep it up , you 'll be a gunslinger in no time . Thank you . It 's amazing . Thank you . Hiro ! He wants to give half the planet superpowers , So that we can save the world together with me as president . And you believed him ? I don 't know what to believe . Nothing makes any sense . I thought the man was dead . I don 't even know what to do with my life Now that he 's alive . Hold on a minute . You are a u.s. senator . You 've got an entire constituency riding on you Having a clear vision of what you believe in . Good luck with that . No , you need to listen to me . You gotta snap the hell out of this . You have to get yourself together . Do you understand ? We should go back to washington . We 'll get the justice department involved- - no . Let 's keep the lid on it . But people have to know . No . Last time I tried to tell anybody anything like this , My brother came back from the future and shot me . Twice . I 'm gonna go to primatech , See what else my mother knows . You go to washington . Cover for me . I 'll be back in touch when I know What our next move is , okay ? Let me guess . You want me to take away your power . No . I 'm actually getting used to it . I 'm here because I think That you and I can help each other . Can we now ? And all I ask on my end Is that you look out for me once the dust settles . See ... I believe that you have a p.r. problem . I pride myself on knowing how the tides turn . I know how the world works , And for your plan to succeed , You need a public face . Now , normally , that would be you . Problem is , the world thinks you 're dead . A thorny issue , I admit . But I think nathan can be that face . The bad news , he 's on the fence . The good news ... I can push him over . You scratch my back , And I will make sure he lands on the right side . Matt ? Can you hear me ? Angela ! You okay ? I 'm here to help you . I 'm gonna get you out of here . You shouldn 't have come . He 's too dangerous . Don 't you understand ? There 's no escape . Even if you get them off , Arthur 's locked all of the doors . These doors are open . I can get us out of here . Daphne . What are you doing here ? I 'm here to help you , matt . Aah ! daphne , don 't ! No . Matt . No. no . You gotta come back . Daphne , don 't . Matt . Matt , wake up ! Matt , wake up ! Matt , you 've got to wake up ! wake up , matt ! Matt , matt , wake up. bring me in there . Matt , you have to take me in there . Matt , we gotta go. matt . Get away from me . I came to help you . Ugh , you stabbed me . That wasn 't me. don 't believe her , matt . Take it from me . A woman will betray you at every turn . You 're lying . Really ? how do you think I knew where you were ? She told me . She betrayed you , matt . Like angela betrayed me . You told him ? I was afraid . I thought I had to. he said he 'd take it all away from me . What are you talking about ? I can 't go back to being the way that I was , matt , But I couldn 't let you die either . I 'm sorry . I just--i didn 't know . Didn 't know what ? How much I cared about you . Matt , you 're bleeding . I don 't know how arthur 's doing it , But you 've got to wake up , or you 're going to die . You can 't trust her , matt. she lies . They all lie . Send her away . No. no , don 't. matt , please . I made a mistake . I trusted the wrong people , but I can 't lose you . I love you . We were once like that , arthur . Remember ? You loved me . And there 's a part of you that still does . So now you 're going To let me go . You understand ? I said , let me go , arthur . We gotta go , fast . We did it . You were there . Was that really you ? Yeah , you brought me in . And those things that you said- - Yeah , that was me too , and I meant every word of it . Detective parkman . Are you okay ? I 'm gonna get a doctor . Parkman ? Peter . She can 't be trusted . You 're the one who can 't be trusted . You shot your own brother , And then you sent me out in the middle of nowhere ! It wasn 't me. it wasn 't me . Matt , you gotta believe me . I 'm telling the truth . Where 's angela ? She 's awake . Test subject was injected with batch 38 At 0634 hours . Heart rate rose to 164 beats per minute . Sustained at that level for two hours . I am so sorry . Please kill me. please . Mom. thank god you 're okay . Your father. he 's alive . I know . I talked to him today . He 's got the formula . Both halves . They were supposed to be hidden away forever , But someone 's stolen them Right out from underneath us . Now peter and I have both seen the future , And trust me , it 's not one that any of you want to face . Make that three of us . And she 's right . Arthur 's probably figured out by now That there 's a third piece of the formula . It won 't work without it . What kind of piece ? It 's a catalyst . Hidden away in the blood of a human host . Kaito nakamura was the only one who knew the identity Of the host , and kaito , as we know , is dead . So how do we find the host ? We don 't have to . We just have to make sure that he doesn 't . When sylar attacked me , he saw something . He took off the top of my head . He said I was different from everyone else . Special . I didn 't understand what that meant until today . I think I 'm the catalyst . It starts with light And ends with light . And in between , there is darkness . Nothing there is beyond hope . Nothing that can be sworn impossible . Nothing left unimagined ... Since zeus , father of the olympians , Made night from midday ... Hiding the light of the shining sun And raining dark fear down upon men . It 's coming .

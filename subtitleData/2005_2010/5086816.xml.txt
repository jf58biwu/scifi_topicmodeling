 Hello Dr. Orpheus and team . You have been approved for your very own Guild-certified Supervillain . Here at the Guild of Calamitous Intent ... your nemesis is our business . But don 't take our word on it , right , Sovereign ? That 's right , Ward . Since 1910 ... the Guild has been providing first-rate professional menace ... to all who qualify . 1910 ! That 's a history you can trust . The Guild is the recognized leader in organized havoc . Just look at these numbers ! Those are some impressive figures , Sovereign . Why would a hero look anywhere else for a villain ? Hold on a minute , Ward . Why doesn 't Dr. Orpheus and team ... just get his own costumed enemy ? Oh , watch . Will you ever learn ? I think this little film may help you understand . Pumpkin ... who delivered this ? Some guy in a winter coat and Techno goggles . Only he had , like , pipes coming out of him . - Why , is the movie busted or something ? - No. lt 's just that ... lf it 's " splash , " l put it on your Netflix list . No , no , no. lt 's not that . " Splash ? " - l just wanted to see it again . - Why would you want ... ? Hold on . Your scheduled screening will take place at the time specified ... and thank you for selecting the Guild of Calamitous Intent ... as the instrument of your demise . " Team " ? " Lair " ? I don 't have ... Today ? Today ? ! Cool beans . What is it ? It 's a walking eye , Hank , and the Government loves them . - What does it do ? - l don 't know . Walking-eye stuff , whatever . This isn 't rocket science . It could be considered a branch of rocket science . - Camera in the eye ? - Completely . - So , it shoots lasers and stuff ? - Daddy 's little man . Probably a bucket comes down for , like , water ... or even , like , monkeys that could totally drive it . Thank you , Hank . Way to go . I guess it would be good for stealth reconnaissance . Well , of course it would be good for reconnaissance applications . - Well , what does it do ? - Walking eye ! It ... Well ... lt has a camera , iris-mounted lasers , monkeyproof welding ... and silent stealth design that makes it perfect for reconnaissance applications . - You got that from us ! - Walking eye , Hank ! They 're all the same . I have it written down from yesterday . What was that ? We 've got a massive breach at the main gates . Of course ! That is a walking eye . Will you do something about it ... or do you want to finish your Tetris game first ? Do something ? Yeah . I 'm opening the secondary gates . What the ... ? It 's like hell on earth out there . Yo , check it ! That car is totally shaped like a dragon . - Choppers ! - Guild wasps . I got to go deal with this . They 're landing in my herb garden . - Time to die , Jefferson Twilight . - Sorry , man . I just dropped off my laundry today . Maybe we can do this next week . It won 't hurt a bit . I recall the process as being quite unpleasant ... but it 's getting hard to remember . It 's been a while . Two hundred years . Dude , this is gonna ... Man , this is gonna wicked , like , really hurt . - Please don 't ! - Need them for my necklace . You want me to wait till after I take your head off ? Told you . I haven 't talked to you in , like , 16 years . You suddenly show up and rescue my ... What gives ? You rescued my situation . That was a coincidence , dear friend . I am here to extend an offer from the Guild of Calamitous Intent . Get out . Approval ? A name-brand archenemy ? That took long enough , but ... this is so ... That is ... But , man , you had a kid ... got married , and got into that " Balancing good and evil " crap . My wife left me , my daughter has a driver 's license ... . and keeping the cosmos from chaos lacks so much of the razzle-dazzle . My peers perceive me as a layabout . No , man . You have a secret identity . That 's classic comic stuff . You 're like Captain ... You 're all Aquaman . Aquaman doesn 't have a secret identity . - He 's always Aquaman . - OK . Bad example . Nobody believes that Aquaman is a stay-at-home dad . Everybody knows what Aquaman does . I don 't know what Aquaman does . Doesn 't he , like , protect some lame , fake-ass kingdom ? I thought he fought Black Manta . Come on ! Why won 't he just die ? You got to remove his head , but I get the teeth . Dude , I was about to kill you ! I have dangerous catlike reflexes . Oh , yeah . You were terrifying when you crapped your pants . What do you got there ? This , my friend , is our future . Check it out . Second-class arching license and reassignment pass . You 're 6 feet and 1 35 pounds ? - Nobody reads it . You just flash it . - You 're joking . - You would suck at arching on your own . - That 's why I made you one . You can 't say no till I show you the piece de r√©sistance . Here 's a hint . Flying chick magnet . Let me think about th- - No ! I almost die every day doing this job . Come on . You got to . You 're telling me we can 't do this better than The Monarch ? Yes ! Exactly that . Do you have any idea how ruthless The Monarch is ? I don 't blame you for desiring me . The Monarch is delicious . Now say it ! - l need my King Butterfly . - Deeper . - l need my ... - Deeper . - l need ... - No . Deeper . - ... butterfly . - Deeper , way deeper . - Butterfly . - Deeper . - King ... - Deeper . - ... butterfly . - lt 's deeper . I need my butterfly . King Butterfly ! - l need my King ... - Deeper . Deeper than that . Way deeper . So , you share a lair with Dr. Orpheus ? - Hardly . He rents an apartment from me . - l can 't believe that we are standing ... in the same conference room the Treaty of Tolerance was signed in . Yes . So cool . Your father is a legend at the Guild . Yeah . Legend . He 's responsible for stealing my father 's leg . Don 't start me ! The real Dr. Venture is why I got into this business . Just keep the nuts away from my lab ... because I have some pretty impressive things going on in there . No . Shut up . Yeah . We 'll do our best to keep him away from your ... - impressive . - Yeah. impressive stuff . You better . Where 's Mr. Magic ? How come the prom queen isn 't here to crown his king ? - He 's astral-projecting , I think . - Showoff . - To assemble his team . - A team ? You mean , he was approved as a team ? What a wuss ! Jealous . The Alchemist , I presume . Byron Orpheus , you old bag of salt crackers ! - How long has it been ? - Too long , my friend . Let me in. I can 't astral-project because I 'm not magic . Knew it . Still all on that stool and looking for the Philosopher 's Stone . I see that , right there . The Philosopher 's Stone is a metaphor for enlightenment . So , in a way , yes , I am searching for it . In the cure for aids . Noble . Now I feel a little stupid for asking you this . So you 're still ... you know . Nah , I grew out of that . Yeah , you know ... lt was just a phase , and I ... - No . Of course I am . Hello ? - Hey , just asking . We 're thinking of reforming the Order of the Triad ! I ... we have been approved for an archvillain . Great ! I 'm in . - But what of your most important work ? - l need the publicity . You know , nothing gets the people in your corner like that hero crap . - See ? - What ? I 'm here , aren 't I ? Plus , I could use the exercise . I don 't know about you guys , but I 'm getting a little paunchy . Tell me about it . At least you have a robe to hide it . Oh , come on . Black is slimming . No . No . I mean , black clothing is slimming . You gentlemen should switch to pinstripes . It leads the eye down . Hank , I need to speak to your brother alone . - You told us we can 't leave our room . - Go sit in the bathroom . - And do what ? - Wash your face or something . You don 't take care of your pimples ... you 'll end up like F. Murray Abraham or Edward Olmos . Do you want to look like somebody made your face out of a beige orange peel ? All right , Dean. I need to talk about a few things with you . - Hank did it . - Not that . Dr. Orpheus asked me to watch his daughter ... which your father can 't do because he doesn 't care to . So , I want you and Hank to entertain her today . Triana ? So you want us to put on a show for her ? Should we write a script , or do something she knows ? - Oh , my goodness . We need costumes ! - l thought you would react this way . Now sit down and let me explain something ... that every boy your age has known for , like , five years . And there she is . You can see her right there writhing on the hood of the car . - What was David Coverdale to do ? - Break up ... White Lion ? That 's Whitesnake , Dean , and yes . Both Brock and I lay the blame squarely on Tawny 's hot , silky shoulders . Now , let that be a lesson to you . - About what ? - l 'm so glad we had this talk . Are those what I think they are ? Only if you think they 're jet packs because those are jet packs . - Where 'd you get those ? - Spoils of war , my friend . Yeah . Sergeant Hatred 's , I think . Please tell me you filed them with Supplies . Oh , my God , when did you become such a dainty little flower ? When the idiot I work with forged documents and stole jet packs ! Look . You telling me you don 't want to fly into some chick 's window ... all super cool with , like , a three-day beard and a ... jet pack ? - Granted , that is kind of sweet . - lt is so sweet . - We 'll need costumes . - Got them , and they are so leather . I 'll be totally flying into some hot chick 's bedroom . Totally , and she 'd be dating the good guy , and I 'll come in , and I 'll be all ... " l 'll spare his life but only for you , sugar pants . " Dude , and then you will have sex ! You will be having sex . Sex ! Get out of my sight . The money is on the bed stand . - You 'll find its amount generous . - Thanks , sugar . Can you give me directions to Liberty Street ? Listen and listen well ! The road before you is beset with many perils . Every turn you make will bring you closer ... to the cold , waiting hands of sister fate . Or just the center of town ? Do you have a pen ? - Maybe I should ... - Bear me , Theseus ... for l am the mighty Minotaur ! This cocoon has witnessed your sins ... and she seeks vengeance . The cocoon will punish the wicked . The cocoon will reward the righteous . You must escape from her grasp . You must earn your freedom ! Dude , I really don 't have time . How much do you want to live ? Looks like we 're up for the same arch . - l 'm the intangible Fancy . - Torrid . Fire theme . Lucky duck . Lots of costume options with a fire theme . Guys like me , we can 't even wear costumes . Do you have ... ? Genitals ? Not anymore . - Why , isn 't that Dr. Venture 's lab ? - Yes. I believe it is . Save my place in the queue . There 's something I feel I must do . Something ... torrid . Well , we 'll keep your resume on file ... and we 'll get back to you . OK . Thanks for your time . Wait. I have a question . What ... ? What is that on your head ? - That like a rudder ? - Yeah . Right . What , do you steer with your head or something ? That 's just dumb . Comes out like easy cheese . Got to get back on the benzoyl-peroxide train . Don 't bother to knock or anything . Bloody hell ! Dean ! Dude , you said you had leather costumes . The pads are leather . Leatherlike . Where did you get these things and why is there a bowl on my helmet ? Yeah. I was on Family Double Dare Totally swiped it . Yeah . Well , that makes me feel better about all the stains . Yeah . That 's gak . You know , physical challenge ? - All right . Let 's do this . Ready ? - Thank God ! A guy can only wear a jet pack for so long without using it . Dude ! My shoe 's on fire ! I just lit my shoes on fire ! Wait up ! It 's not working ! Hold on ! Time ! Yes. I only hunt Blackulas . So you only hunt African-American vampires . No . Sometimes I hunt British vampires . They don 't have African-Americans in England . Oh , yeah . Yeah . Good point . - So I hunt Blackulas . - l was just trying to be ... I specialize in hunting black vampires . I don 't know what the PC name for that is . is that a mask ? Oh , my God , I was just gonna ask that ! What a fascinating puritan you are , Lady Windermere . The adjective was unnecessary , Lord Darlington . I couldn 't help it . I can resist everything except temptation . You have the modern affectation of weakness . It 's only an affectation , Lady Win ... Winder ... Windermere . Hank , come on . Enter the Duchess of Berwick ! I 'm in the bathroom , and you got to get in here . It smells like gunpowder throw-up poo-poo eggs . Oh , that 's my exit . Dean , you owe me one . Triana , you feel like playing Lord whatever-the-hell ? No , not really . Brock , you can 't go . You 're also Lady Agatha . No , Dean . For serious , come smell this already ! OK , Curse . Was it Curse or Chris ? Curse . We can use magic , right ? That 's kind of my bag . - Of course . - Absolutely . - Bring it on . - Magic is a plus . On three , we give him the old Rochambeau . Rock , paper , scissors ? What does a General from the American Revolution have to do with this ? American Revolution ? " Rochambeau " sounds French to me . Well , yes . The Franco-American forces ... They fought with SpaghettiOs and meatballs ? Why would a company called " Franco-American " make ltalian food ? Dijnam stopeus . O spiritus sancti . Yeah . OK , gentlemen . That ruled . - Was that the Rochambeau ? - No . It really should be ! But which door to choose ? That one could have fun , surprises , and a year 's supply of turtle wax behind it . Or the polar bear from Lost . Probably not the best idea , Doc . You said everything is running itself over there . Don 't you remember telling me that nobody cares about my walking eye ? Well , I didn 't mean for you to take it outside . - Needs air . - All right . Watch your head . What 's up with your outfit ? Did you have an away game ? Helping Dean put on the worst version ... of Lady Windermere 's Fan to impress Triana . Said it was your idea . Hardly. I was trying to tell him about the birds and the bees . Yeah . How did that work out for you ? He staged Lady Windermere 's Fan . You should see a doctor ! It smells like you pounded garbage into your butt . Knock it off ! We have a mystery in our bathroom . Query . Can flames come out of a toilet ? - Hank , if you did this ... - l didn 't . Dude , if I did this , I would tell you . I would be , like , almost proud of this . You guys have been in there for , like , an hour . What are you doing in th- - Hank , what is wrong with you ? Right ? It smells like a Bible story in here . Did my grandpa teach you to crap ? We should get Brock . Every time there 's a super cool mystery to solve ... you go get a grownup . Lame ! Thank you , Brock . Thanks for helping me with the walking eye . Look at this walking eye . It 's filthy . Guess I should wash off my ... walking eye . - Well , just retrace your steps . - Yeah . Retrace your ... Man , she is good . I was standing out here ... and I think somebody was on the toilet . Then I opened the door . - l killed your girlfriend ! - She 's my girlfriend ? Probably , before I killed her . Why is he doing this ? " Down , still unceasingly , still inevitably down ! " Still I quivered in every nerve ... " to think how slight a sinking of the machinery ... " would precipitate the keen , glistening axe upon my bosom . " I could chase that around . Oh , yeah . Team of three , impressive resume , you seem perfect . But I can 't stop thinking that I know you , Miss ... - Au Pair. lt 's Lady Au Pair . - Goodness Gracious . - Oh , my ... - Feminine . And these are my Murderous Moppets and you don 't know me . That 's a voice ! Do you smoke cigarettes or do you eat them ? Oh , forget it . All right. I 'm ... Good-bye . Anybody want a moppet ? - We have to get Dr. O. - Yeah . Good plan . " Oh , hey , ' sup , Dr. O. ? So , yeah , we ... accidentally killed Triana . " Come on , Dean . We have to do this . You 're right . List our clues again . One , goth chick catches fire and disappears . Two , no smoldering body beating " kill me , kill me " in Morse code ... - ... with what is left of her head . - Stop it ! Three , the smell of a dumpster full of burning diapers . - And four ... - Wait a minute . Run the shower and only the hot . - Just as I thought ! - You 're a genius . - lt 's Triana 's handwriting . - How can you tell ? She dotted her " i " with a big circle . That 's a total chick move . It says , " l 'm in the torrid zone . Tell my feather . " We have to find her feather ! Give it up already . You could take a bus . Dude , Jet Boy and Jet Girl do not take buses . Last time , we are not Jet Boy and Jet Girl . I don 't care if I get to be Jet Boy . Those names suck . But it 's a French song , street cred with the indie crowd . The Damned do a cover of it . Then we should be The Damned . That is a way cooler name . You may sit down , if you would be more comfort ... I shall stand . Sitting is for the weak and feeble . I like this guy . He 's all full of ... - What ? I feel like standing . - ... full of beans ... - l happen to have back pain . - ... and ants , fire ants . So , what kind of ... menace do you think you could offer the Order of the Triad ? - l 've kidnapped your daughter . - Balls , brass balls . You kidnapped my pumpkin ! - We have a winner . - The guy is not even a Blackula . Right . That eye is crawling with villains . Yeah . They gave up on Orpheus and his little kaffeeklatsch . Oh , they know a real archrival when they see one . - You want a sandwich ? - No. I ate already . You ... want me to rescue it or something , pull them off it ? There 's Guild Security out there shooting foam at them . Between you and me , the stupid thing hardly worked , anyway . But when word of this gets out , business will pick right up . Well , I 'm gonna go out there and get some of that action . - Don 't you want to change ? - No way . I love wearing a tux when I kill guys . Makes you kind of feel like James Bond . So , who 's the lucky winner ? A fetid little firebrand named Torrid . Yeah . The son of a bitch kidnapped his daughter to the torrid zone . Torrid zone . So butch ! - l solved that mystery . - Yes , you did . You see , the torrid zone is merely the area between ... the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn . I own an island there in the Great Barrier Reef . So , Triana is safe on Orpheus Island ... sunning herself in a bikini ... and oiling her ski- - her skin down in her bikini . Dude , what the ... ? What are you doing up there ? OK . Time to get off my shoulders . I just want to commend you ... on accepting Hank for who he really is . Let 's show Mr. Venture our thing . The Order of the Triad , go ! Get out of my kitchen . We can still do this , Jet Boy . I can 't hear you because I hate you . You coming , Jet Girl ? No ! No ! Not again ! I can 't believe that whore stole my stanza . I can 't believe that whore made it through the Lake of Acid . Ca c 'est une bonne soupe !

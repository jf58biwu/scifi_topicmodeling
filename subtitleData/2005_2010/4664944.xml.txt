I 'm trying hard ! Mikuru responded cheerfully in her costume that was trying too hard . the cabbages sold out in an instant . 23 ) } Kiyosumi Morimura-san ( 46 ) Thanks for always helping out . but please accept it . No ! Please don 't say that ! I should be the one apologizing . This is all I am able to do ... I have to go to the butcher 's now . Goodbye ... oh ! Bye bye ! she had become an irreplaceable mascot character for this shopping district and was loved by the local residents . Mikuru ! Bring the customers back from that large department store that opened last year . The fate of this region 's economy and mom and pop stores rest solely upon your shoulders . this has nothing to do with our story . Moving along to the actual story ... she is a combat waitress and her mission is basically to secretly protect a certain boy . The boy 's name was Itsuki Koizumi . carefree high school student ... he was an esper . he had yet to realize that . It appeared that something was needed to trigger the awakening of the super incredible power within him . 7 ) } Skirt steak 22 ) } 100 grams 41 ) } 298 yen ! 41 ) } 298 yen ! It appears that she was unable to approach the older student she admired . Although the two of them look the same age .

Mikuru-chan ? Um ... It was okay . There were a lot of customers today ... It was good business ! That is good to hear . Today 's work was done . Mikuru could finally remove that sleazy costume and dress in a casual manner . Just to make things clear no further filming was done of the changing scene . I have no words of comfort to offer your dejected spirits . I 'm not lying . we now see Yuki Nagato . she sure doesn 't look like a normal person ... she was actually an evil magician . And an alien on top of that . But I 'm wondering this scene seems to be intended to show us Yuki has something planned for Itsuki ... But there is no point in her staying behind at school when Itsuki has already gone home and a short while back one could tell it was near sunset yet right now it appears to be noon . Filming at whim is fine but at least do some editing to prevent awkward cuts like these . Mikuru and Yuki had their first confrontation . As for all the happenings that led from their first meeting to their fated relationship I 'll have to allow the viewers to imagine each girl 's circumstances . For the following scene ... If production actually went according to plan it will be a great blessing . Koizumi-kun ... ! Itsuki-kun will not fall into your hands !

The Mikuru Beam is a very dangerous beam attack that comes out of Mikuru Asahina 's left eye . Cut ! Cut ! What unexpected turn of events will come next ? Yuki ! What are you doing ? - What are you doing ! ? That wasn 't in the script ! What will be the fate of Mikuru ? Nagato ! Why did Itsuki suddenly show up ? 140 ) } Ohmori Electronics Th-This store ... !

After being defeated by Yuki in their first encounter Mikuru was troubled . The Mikuru Beam doesn 't work ... I have to do something ! It seems that Mikuru wasn 't a transforming superhero ... She actually had to physically change . she has to go to work again today . At that moment Itsuki was walking down the street with the usual vacant look on his face . Who are you ? I am a magic-wielding alien . Really ... Really . What do you want with me ? You possess a hidden power . I am after that power . what would you do ? I will use forceful measures to take you if I must . What are these forceful measures you speak of ? Like this . Look out ! Ow ! Owie ... I-I won 't let you have your way ! I shall back off for now . you won 't be so lucky next time . Use this opportunity to prepare your tombstone . I shall not hesitate to destroy you . Who are you ? I 'm just a bunny girl who happened along ! That 's all . Goodbye now ! Who is she ... ? Itsuki watched Mikuru leave . And what 's with this pan up ? a number of scenes are omitted . Various things happened afterwards and they found themselves in battle again . Maybe . Th-That isn 't enough to make me give up ! Yuki-san ! Quietly leave Earth at once ! You should be the one to vanish from this time . He will fall into our hands . He is valuable to us . we will start by invading Earth . I-I won 't let you do that ! If it costs me my life ! Then we shall take your life . Tsuruya-san ! too ! Come to your senses ! It 's hard to take you seriously in that outfit ... Mikuru . you see . I 'm sorry . That Starring Inferno wand sent out ... Mikuru . Prepare yourself . ... magic or electromagnetic waves or something and turned Tsuruya-san and the other two into mind-controlled puppets . Now Mikuru cannot fight back . Mikuru ? She couldn 't do anything at all . What is the matter ? Grab my hand . Calm down . where was Itsuki before he suddenly showed up ? I get the feeling he was accidentally on screen a while ago . It was cold ... What were you doing in this place ? Um ... and ... ( You 're supposed to faint ! ) Get a hold of yourself . one would call an ambulance or ask for help from one of the nearby residents but this particular boy ... innocent girl ... bastard ? where did Yuki and those others disappear to without delivering the final blow ? Leaving various mysteries and inconsistencies completely unaddressed this story has finally reached the midway point . Wait . It 's only half over ? 67 ) } Mikuru 67 ) } Mikuru 55 ) } Asahina 35 ) } The Adventures 49 ) } of This appears to be Itsuki 's home . What I really want to know is why Mikuru is being carried in that suggestive state of dress ... while she was unconscious Itsuki gave Mikuru a bath ! ? Yes ! That has to be it ! every one of us would feel our doubt transform into rage and then into murderous intent ... let us suppress those boiling feelings and not think too much about the matter . There is no way a person on screen would act in such a realistic manner as we are imagining . Wait . What 's this out of the blue ? If your face gets any closer somebody who isn 't supposed to be in this scene is going to walk over and kick your ass ! Hey ! Halt . Itsuki Koizumi . You should not choose her . Your power will be validated after becoming one with mine . Whatever do you mean ? Shouldn 't you first be surprised about Yuki showing up in the window ? All I can say now is that you have two choices before you . You can join me in advancing this universe towards its true form or join with her and pluck out the possibilities of the future . Itsuki was deeply troubled . Nagato 's ... right ... I see . he ... it would be me . correct ? And that key itself is unable to affect anything . The key is merely a means to open the door . something will change . what will change is ... Yuki-san . I currently do not have the right to decide . I believe that it is too early to make a choice . Can we put this matter on hold ? We still need time to think . however it 's a different story . The time for that will come in the near future . it is certain that the time is not now . We have a custom of considering a lack of information a critical flaw . The potential stages will be unable to proceed in a clear fashion . Foreshadowing tends to sound dramatic . It was still an incomprehensible conversation but Itsuki and Yuki seemed to reach some kind of mutual understanding for some reason . 38 ) } Yamatsuchi Model Shop Th-This model shop was apparently opened last year after Keiji Yamatsuchi ( 28 ) escaped his life as a white-collar worker ! so he just went for it ! he hasn 't experienced the sales growth he 'd like ... Um ... They 're aiming for 80 % growth between this year 's first term and last year 's first term so everyone be sure to stop by ! You want me to hold it ? Y-You mustn 't fire this at people ! Settle for shooting empty cans and such ! You want me to shoot ? the story 's pretty much disappeared at this point but here 's some unexpected development ! Mikuru and Itsuki have begun living together . A development into a newlyweds story that makes you wonder what the SF battles before were about . With arousing situations at every corner perhaps this is a quick way out of the rut in the plot . who is this ? Shami . Say hi . Is she supposed to be Itsuki 's little sister ? Here ! And wasn 't this cat on Yuki 's shoulder just a moment ago ? I 'm Shami ! Nice to meet you ! Yuki refuses to lose . What 's this ? She 's transferred into Itsuki 's high school . Using sex appeal as the new strategy Yuki attempted to ensnare Itsuki . is it just my imagination that it seems odd for her to use such a direct method ? 169 ) } North Prefe Mikuru transferred into the same high school . We 'll ignore the fact that if ... why didn 't she sneak into the school in the first place ? 171 ) } North Prefe Yuki and Mikuru 's battle turned into that of an intense romantic comedy . ... this is just a love triangle now . but it appears they had formed a truce while at school . Or perhaps they both happened to remember their true duty . They returned to their costume of combat waitress and alien magician and continued their pedestrian battles . what will happen now ! ? and I haven 't the slightest ! The suspense is killing me ! What a dramatic turn of events . And so this incoherent story takes an unnatural turn towards a conclusion . 309 ) } Let 's settle this . The director of this film ... regardless of what the ending was . Though I get the feeling that it 's a bit late ... At any rate Yuki has challenged her to a final battle . I see ! What did she just see ? Mikuru ? You look like you 're being stalked by some old geezer . Did Mizumushi just fire you or something ? The time has finally come ! I must go to the final battle ! That sounds amazing . Mikuru . Earth is in your ha — I 'm finding that I have to clear things up quite often ... I 'll do my best ... It 's quite natural to think that Mikuru and Tsuruya-san met each other after Mikuru transferred so having Tsuruya-san appear in that lake scene was obviously a production mistake ... when unable to transition into the next scene why not do a shot of the sky ? this is finally the climax scene . Why don 't we settle this once and for all ? We do not have much time remaining . We must end this before our lunch break is over . I must concur on that point but Itsuki-kun will definitely pick me ! I have faith in him ! I have no intention of respecting his personal wishes . I shall take his power . or am I the only one who can see that ? I won 't let you ! That is why I have come from the future ! Mikuru-chan ! Fight back ! Fight back ! Hey ! What do you think you 're — Completely ignoring the lecturing of the teachers who came running upon hearing fireworks and firecrackers Mikuru was finally cornered . It 's really high ... All things must come to an end . Accept your fate . Yuki 's finishing blow strikes Mikuru . but there aren 't any scenes left to raise the tension so please use your imagination to cover the rest ! She is in a desperate situation ! What will happen to Mikuru ! ? Are you okay ? Yuki-san . Please stop this . There is no need to consider his words . Why don 't you just take control of his mind ? Shamisen ! Stop talking ! ) - ( Stop talking ! ) From my observations you possess the ability to do just that . That was ventriloquism . Itsuki Koizumi . I shall take control of your will .

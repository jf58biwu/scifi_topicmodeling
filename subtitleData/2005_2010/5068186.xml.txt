 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : You like me ? The loner weirdo ? That 's why I came up to you that day . I thought , since you 're a weirdo ... - ... you 'd get me . - She 's a security risk . You understand I 'm gonna keep seeing Riley ... - ... even if it 's a bad idea ? - You 're all crazy . It 's all gonna burn and you 're gonna be nothing but bleached skulls . - You wanted to talk ? - I don 't think I can do this anymore . - What if I want out ? - There is no out . We 're developing a human-interactive AI . Hello , Mr. Ellison . My name 's John Henry . The AI needs to be trained . You taught it rules , but it 's got no ethics . I keep seeing it in my dreams , John . It means something . - It was written in blood on my wall . - Mom , you 're tired . You 've been sick . Chasing killer robots will do that to you . Tell me about the three dots . In 1490 the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca landed on shores of the New World seeking power and fortune . He was immediately attacked and captured almost all of his traveling companions murdered . Enslaved , de Vaca chose to embrace his captor 's beliefs and learned their ways . He became a healer . Over time , he was freed and de Vaca attracted his own following who believed he had the power over life and death . The desert had transformed him . He was not the first , and he would not be the last . It 's like the world 's been pulled out from under my feet . I don 't know what 's real and what 's not . Eileen , what you 're describing is common among experiencers such as yourself . When a person lives through something beyond human understanding we experience fear , a loss of control , a sense of isolation and a deep , almost existential , loneliness . And you , Ms. Fly-on-the-Wall ? What brings you here today ? I 'm Sarah . Hello , Sarah . Welcome . I came here today because there have been reports of people seeing UFOs with this mark . I need to find out what it means . It 's important to you . I 've been dreaming about it . I 'm having nightmares . Are they nightmares or are they memories ? My son thinks I 'm crazy . Maybe not crazy . Maybe that 's the wrong word . But he doubts me . - He 's never doubted me before . - Oh . If there 's one thing we understand here it 's doubt . I have additional photos on my website . Here 's my card . And these are actual photos of the California drones . These alien spacecraft have been spotted in various locations around the state . Alien . Not military ? Oh , definitely not military . The drones ' loitering capability is beyond anything our military has in its fleet . No , the Predator , Reaper , none of them has anywhere near the presence the drones do . And the symbol ... ? Now , some witnesses have reported seeing the three dots on the hull of the spacecraft . The mark is also referred to in the Abraham blogs . Abraham claims to be a scientist working on a top-secret alien-centric project being covered up by the authorities . The metal hyper-alloy that he was working with exhibited a tensile strength far beyond our existing technology . Fire , explosions , extreme pressure , this metal could survive it all . It was basically indestructible . Abraham . Where do I find him ? That 's the million-dollar question . I don 't know . No one knows . Abraham blogged a few times , then he disappeared six months ago . You think someone killed him ? I know your type . Come out , watch the kooks , have a good laugh at our expense . - I 'm not laughing at anyone . - Enjoy the rest of the freak show . You 're interested in Abraham ? - Hello ? - Hey , John . Hey . You coming home ? No , I 've got a lead . I 'll be home late . From the flying-saucer convention . The UFO experiencers , yes . There 's a blogger named Abraham . He may have worked with endoskeleton metal . Oh , well , we all know how reliable bloggers are . - Why do you have to be so sarcastic ? - Mom just be careful out there , okay ? Wow . - And I thought my room was a disaster . - Your room is a disaster . Berry Bonanza or Peachy Keen ? - This is a work in progress , all right ? - It sure is something . You okay ? I 'm peachy keen . Why ? Do I not look peachy keen ? You 're smiling with your mouth but not your eyes . See ? You 're doing it right now . I flipped out at my foster mom . What do you mean " flipped out " ? Two of the kids were fighting and it kind of got to me . So I went on this little rant . About what ? They 're just so naive , you know ? They have no idea how good they have it . All they do is complain about every little thing and everyone at school 's the exact same way . It 's like one big whine-a-thon . You 're so lucky your mom 's homeschooling you . Yeah , it 's been awesome . - You didn 't buy me a smoothie . - I 'm sorry , I didn 't know you were here . I 'm always here . Cameron , I 'm not sure we 're gonna have enough paint . Would you do me a favor and go out and get some ? You have 420 square feet to paint . - What you have should be sufficient . - Two coats . It 's a bigger job than it looks . I have a job too . Well , could you do it in the other room ? Please ? Peachy Keen is my favorite . Come here . You 're a pretty girl . What 's your name ? Does Abraham know we 're coming ? Abraham doesn 't live here , I do . - You said- - - Interested in Abraham ? You 'll want to see this . Abraham is a pseudonym ? Alan Park is his real name . Has a master 's from MIT , specialized in something called " lidar . " - Light detection and ranging . - You know what it stands for then you know lidar is an optical remote-sensing technology . Like radar , except with light . - Its main application is- - - Robots . You say that like it 's a bad thing . All I can offer you is tea . You seem more like a coffee type . So I 've been told . Type A. Focused . Goal-oriented . And yet here I stand with a cup of chamomile tea . - Can I ask you a personal question ? - Could I stop you ? What are you doing out here in the desert ? - Looking for answers . - About Abraham ? Abraham . Life . Whether the government is hiding little green men in fallout shelters . How to make the perfect cup of tea . You ? I haven 't figured out all my questions yet . A doubting Thomas in the house can 't help . How about you ? You got family ? Or is this a one-gal operation ? Just me , myself and the coyotes . Solitude . I remember it fondly . Most of the time , I love it . Most of the time . These are drone sightings . And these are sightings of Abraham . This one 's the most recent . Then that 's where we 'll start . This room is so adorable . How could you not like it ? Because I 'm not 8 . It 's my mom 's subconscious way of trying to keep me a kid . The minute she took off , out came the paintbrush . Where 'd she go ? - You don 't wanna know . - Yeah , I do actually . - Why ? - Because she 's your mom and I care about you . Hey , you got something . - What happened to you ? - Nothing . - It 's a bruise . - John , it 's nothing . Who did that to you ? - John , please . - Was it your foster dad ? - No . It was no one , okay ? - I swear I 'll kick his ass . John . It wasn 't him , okay ? I swear . Just drop it , please . The answer 's still no . - I can 't do what you 're asking . - Shame . I thought a night 's sleep would change your mind . I didn 't sleep . John Henry needs someone to talk to now that Dr. Sherman is gone . Dr. Sherman is gone because he- - It killed him . It wasn 't murder , Mr. Ellison . You said so yourself . You said I was remiss in creating John Henry without teaching him right from wrong . This is our opportunity to correct that oversight . Our opportunity ? Your religious faith and paternal instinct make you the ideal candidate to foster his moral development . That thing killed 20 FBI agents . It needs a whole lot more than just a talking to . The program responsible for those murders is gone . The John Henry program is no more responsible for the deaths of those FBI agents than you or I. Many believe tactile experience is integral to AI development . This body is merely a puppet . An interface . We control him . You control him . And when John Henry completes his development ? When he realizes what his puppet is capable of do you know how powerful he 'll be ? Cows are more powerful than man , Mr. Ellison . But I 'd still rather be the farmer with the rifle . Talk to John Henry . Teach him right from wrong . You know , Abraham was spotted here a week ago . - By who ? - I don 't know . It was an anonymous posting in a UFO chat room . - Do you belong to many newsgroups ? - I 'm not much for computers . Usually they go hand in hand . Computers , technology , visitations . Not for me . I 'm only interested in the drones and the markings , the ones that Abraham saw . - Everything comes back to Abraham . - I guess so . What are we doing here ? Well right now , I 'm gonna go pee . Abraham . Where is he ? If you know , tell me now . I am Abraham . I 'm the one you 're looking for . My real name is Alan Park . What else is real ? - All of it . - All of it . The research , the blogs . It 's all true . Except the woman part . - My life was in danger . I needed to hide . - From who ? - I don 't know . - Not good enough . A few years after MIT , I went to work for an aerospace firm . It was there that I was approached by a company that needed my expertise with lidar . The money was good . More than good , it was incredible . They gave us cars , company housing . What was the project ? That 's the thing . I never knew . No one knew . We all signed NDAs . Everybody worked in isolation . But we had access to technology and materials I 'd never seen . Was it military ? I started blogging asking if anyone recognized what I was working with . Strange things started to happen . My apartment was broken into . And then one day I was driving home from work and my brakes went out . Next morning , I went to the bank and withdrew all my savings , went into hiding . Some disguise . I couldn 't take any risks . You took a risk with me . You know something about all of this that I don 't . I can tell . You have proof ? Can you prove anything you just told me ? I have a piece . The metal I worked with . I stole a piece before I left . - Where is it ? - In a storage facility . I rented it the day I disappeared . I 'll drive . It 's not safe . It never is . You all right ? It 's okay if you 're not . I want you to tell me if you 're not . I 'm all right . Maybe this color red is too bright . Maybe the brown was better . The red 's perfect . You 're just not used to it . The lady in the store said I was an autumn . I 've never even seen autumn . Why did you pick me ? I 've always wanted to ask . But you never have . I thought you 'd tell me when the time was right . I think the time is right . No , sweetie . The time 's past . What happened to your face ? Nothing . How did you get hurt ? It was nothing . Smacked into a door . - What part ? - What ? Of the door . I don 't know . Just the door . I like your star . - Excuse me ? - Your tattoo . It 's tight . Thank you . I 'm thinking of getting one . Can I look at yours ? - Did it hurt ? - Not too much . They stuck needles into your skin . Needles can be painful . Hey . What 's going on ? I 'm looking at her star . She 's thinking about getting one . A tattoo . Of what ? A tiger or a wolf . I haven 't decided yet . We need to talk . I 'm cool . Really . Talk . We missed you at choir practice . Don 't think my wife doesn 't notice when our best baritone is gone . - I 'm sorry . Things have been crazy . - You 've been through a difficult time . We need to see more of you not less . Do you remember I come from a big family ? Seven kids ? Before Lila and I got married , we used to talk into the night ... - ... about how many kids we 'd have . - Family is a blessing . Yeah , she wanted three , maybe four . I was more in the four to five range . Sounds like there was room for compromise . She wanted to wait until she made it through Quantico . I agreed . She graduated September 1st , 2001 . We started trying in earnest that very night . - Ten days later- - - September 11th . She decided she didn 't want to get pregnant anymore . Understandable reaction . But she already was . I didn 't find out until after she had terminated it . I always wondered what happened between you two . Yeah , that 's what happened . When you called today you said you wanted guidance . Yeah , that 's true . Does this have to do with Lila ? No . Does it have something to do with the child ? - The child ? - Yes . Does this have something to do with the child ? I don 't know . I don 't know . It 's gone . I swear it was here . Sarah , they must 've broken in . Who are you ? What do you want from me ? - The truth . - I told you I don 't know . The name led to a shell corporation . It 's all a dead end . - You 're lying . - No . - You 're a liar and a fake . - You 're the fake . You 're a mother . You 're a seeker . You 're a soldier . You 're everything but you 're nothing . You don 't know anything about me . Oh , really ? I 'm a man who lives as a woman , and you 're a woman who lives as- - Stop . - What made you so hard ? - Who were you working for ? - You almost got me killed . - Tell me . Tell me about the metal , about the symbols . The bullets , I could feel them . They were close . So close . We nearly died . You don 't feel it . Why don 't you feel it ? I don 't hate them , you know ? - They tried to kill you . Twice . - They did kill me . They killed Alan Park . And I thank them for it . They gave me a gift . The life I was scared to lead . Before this happened , I was a cog in the machine . Ordinary , repressed . How many people dare to live the life they dream of ? Face their real fears about who they really are not their houses , or their jobs , or their habits but their deepest , truest selves ? Do you have any idea what I 'm talking about ? I used to be a waitress . They killed her too . Tell me about your lab . Where is it ? They made sure we never knew . The company came , picked us up every morning . Drove us in a van with blacked-out windows to the facility . What is it ? There may be a way to help you remember . What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry , Jesse . No one 's following me . I double backed like you taught me . Jesse , I 'm really sorry . - Don 't get mad at me , please . - Phones . - That 's why we have phones . - I just didn 't know where else to go . Yeah , well not here , sweetie . Any place but here . I got kicked out of my foster home . - You did what ? - I got kicked out . They threw me out because I hit Kay , my foster mom . I was just freaking out . You know , I started thinking about everything . What 's coming for all of us . For them . I just- - I needed someone to talk to . I need you . I was thinking that instead of just getting another foster home that maybe we could find someplace close together . Like an apartment or something . I 'll just tell John that I quit school and we can be together . I 'm not here to babysit . And you 're not here to feel sorry for yourself . I 'm not your friend . I am not your mother . And you are here to keep John Connor away from her . Go finish your job . Go . She 's lying . About what ? I don 't know , but her pulse was elevated , and her hand was perspiring . She 's lying . Yeah , her pulse was elevated because you were freaking her out . As usual . - What happened to her face ? - I don 't know . She didn 't say . I can get her to tell me the truth . Stay away from her . Riley . Riley , answer me . Open it . Now . New memories can be confusing . The question Sally poses is very important . How soon do we tell a new person in our lives we 've experienced an abduction ? Dr. Morris ? Sarah . We met at the UFO convention . I 'm busy at the moment , but if you 'd like to make an appointment ... . No appointment . It 's an emergency . No matter what happens , I 'm never going back to what I was . Good luck . Have a seat , please . Who taught you how to play chess ? I did . Did you play with Dr. Sherman ? No . We played other games . Talking games . Do you miss Dr. Sherman ? I 'm designed to learn . He helped me learn . His absence slows my growth . His absence is more important than that . His value was more than just his function for you . Human beings aren 't like chess pieces . It matters if we live or die . Why does it matter ? All humans die eventually . Yes . That 's true . But their lives are sacred . Do you know what sacred means ? Holy . Worthy of respect . Venerable . Do you know why human life is sacred ? Because so few humans are alive compared to the number that are dead ? No . Because we 're God 's creation . God made everything . The stars , the Earth , everything on this planet . We are all God 's children . Am I God 's child ? That 's one of the things we 're here to talk about . Checkmate . I win . Would you like to play again ? Your body is completely relaxed . Your mind is clear and open . I 'm gonna count down from five . When I reach one , you 'll be in the park waiting for your ride to work . You ready ? I 'm ready . Five , four , three , two , one . Where are you ? What do you see ? I 'm waiting at the bench . There are five other people . We all live in town . We all climb inside the van . After a few miles , we come to a stop . There 's a sound . At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse . There 's an office in front . No windows . No way to see in or out . Does that bother you ? No . I like not being seen . The van parks outside . The driver unlocks the door . We head inside . Can I help you ? I said , can I help you ? Your body is completely relaxed . Your mind clear and open . I 'm gonna count down from five . When I reach one , you 'll be in the park waiting for your ride to work . Are you ready ? I 'm ready . Five , four , three two , one . Where are you ? What do you see ? I 'm waiting at the bench . There are five other people . We all live in town . - Here it comes now . - The van ? It approaches from the left . We climb inside the van . It heads north out of town . It 's dim inside . I can barely see . Does the darkness disturb you ? No . Secrecy doesn 't bother me . Because I have a secret too . And what 's your secret ? I 'm not who they think I am . After a few miles , we come to a stop . There 's a sound . What is it ? Eileen ? I don 't know . The sound . It doesn 't- - Trust yourself . The truth is inside you . - What do you hear ? - It 's rain . Every day . But the heat . We 're in the desert . It doesn 't make sense . Nothing makes sense . We 're on a dirt road . Now a bump . A clacking under the tires . At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse . There 's an office in front . No windows . No way to see in or out . Does that bother you ? No . I like not being seen . I don 't know who they are , but that 's okay because they don 't know who I really am either . And who are you ? I 'm a waitress . Will do . First thing in the morning . - I 'm sorry , ma 'am . We 're closed . - Where 's the metal ? Please . Don 't shoot . Please don 't shoot me . - The metal . Where is it ? - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Who are you ? - My name 's Winston . I install air conditioning , all right ? Please don 't hurt me . I have a wife . I have a son . I 'm his coach . I 'm his Little League coach . Put your hands on your head . - What 's in the warehouse ? - I don 't know . My boss rents it out to another company . Look , I 'm just an installer . I know where you live . Don 't call the police .

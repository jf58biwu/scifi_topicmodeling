 had contact with just about everyone who 's gotten sick . Daisy , what 's inside Miranda kills faster than any known disease . William put it there . - No , that 's bullshit ! - Tell me William 's other name . Zanzinger is Martin Jamieson , the biological father of Daisy Markovic 's baby . Daisy , I am so sorry . There 's no hope ? It turns out we 're not the only ones looking for him . Who else ? Oh , you name it . The South Africans , the Pakistanis . Why Pakistan ? I don 't know yet , but wasn 't that scientist that was murdered - outside your office , wasn 't she ... - Hira Kahn , yeah . I 've got a lead on a sample of the Spanish lady . From where ? It 's a long story . Oh , you 're fucking beautiful . The Spanish Flu . We got it , David . - We got it ? - We got it . It 's her . I almost died when I saw it . Miranda . So , we should be looking for Chiernegin , he 's the one behind Miranda ? He 's behind taking what came out of Fort Egan and turning it into something that 's far more deadly and I 'm sure he 's not going to stop there . The temperature spikes up to 105 , lungs are 93 % filled with fluid . You ever see a virus that virulent ? This is what came out of Denver ? That 's what you sent . No . No . What ? Jill ? What is it ? It 's the fucking 1918 Spanish Flu . You 're thinking Hira . If Chiernegin got to her and she did cross the line , - a man like that would want her dead . - Why would he go after David ? You 're right . I think it would be a good idea that we put some security around David . I really fucked up this time . David , he was hit by a car . A cab . He 's in the hospital in a coma . What ? Go to 360 . Clear . Okay , go home , pack your long johns and catch the next flight up there . - Fuck . - What ? I don 't know what 's worse : thinking some terrorist released this flu or that the head scientist for NorBAC did . Fuck . 1x13 - The Longest Night Hi there . Hi . Constable Johnson . Welcome to Iqaluit . Thank you , I 'm Jill from NorBAC . And , is he at home , do we know ? - Well , there 's only one way to find out . - Okay . Joe , it 's Matty Johnson . Joe ? Come on , Joe . You 've got visitors . Joe ? Go put your shorts on , we 're coming in ! - He 's a bit of a nudist . - Excellent . Joe ! Come on , Joe , make yourself presentable . Fuck . Is that Joe ? Better not touch anything . Joe . Joe , if you 're there pick up , okay ? Look , I need you to go out and see if the body 's still there . And don 't touch it , okay ? Do you know the caller ? Yeah , it 's my boss . Sandstrom , what the hell are you doing ? This hotel sucks . - Oh my God , sit down . - Oh , get off of me . Are you crazy ? You 've been out of a coma for only 6 hours . - And I 'm fine . - Sit down ! David ! - Ow ! Ribs ! Ribs ! - Sorry . - What 's going on in Denver ? - It 's in good hands . Has the outbreak been contained ? - No , not yet . - I 'm going to have to get back to work . No . David , you need to get to bed . There 's no fucking way you are leaving this hospital , David . David , will you please just take one of those ? I caused it , Mayko . What ? - I let it out . - What ? What are you talking about ? The Spanish Flu . I 'm responsible for the outbreak . David , you 're not making any sense . The flu sample that I got , the one that Jill and I sequenced , it wasn 't sent to me . I stole it . What ? I went to Nunavut . There was a body , frozen , buried in the ... A miner who died of the Spanish Flu in 1918 and I dug him up without permission . I took a sample . Wait . So , you 're saying Denver ... It 's the same fucking flu , look . I ... I don 't get it . How did your flu get to Denver ? I don 't know yet . Well , then maybe it 's like some weird coincidence . Right . The Spanish Flu kills 40 million people , it dies out , 80 years later . I dig it up , a few months after that it starts killing again . It 's not a coincidence , Mayko , it 's a fucking train wreck . Nepal ... Chernobyl ... - Sandstrom . - Okay , okay . There are 8 segments in the virus . Let 's sequence every one and just make sure . I don 't need to see 8 segments to know what I 'm looking at . Denver is a perfect match to Nunavut . - You 're jumping to conclusions . - You 're wasting time . We need a vaccine , not an alibi . Okay , well I 'm going to sequence the whole viral genome . We 're going to need it for vaccine anyway . We 're going to have to get every flu lab in the world on this . David , if Caroline finds out ... She 's not going to find out . Here . I 'm going to tell her . David ? Hey . I was on my way to the hospital to give you this . David ? - What are you doing here ? - What ? They let you out ? I 've got something to say . Me first . Sit down . I found records of payments you made to Joe Okalik , your source for the Spanish Flu . We thought he screwed up when he exhumed the body , so we needed to know who he was . Now you know . You broke the law and scientific protocol . Jill just forwarded to me the emails you sent him . He was looking for that body for 14 months . More like 2 years . I 've been trying to get in touch with him . He 's dead . The flu ? No . He 'd been drinking . He fell in the shower , hit his head . Morrison . Hey , Jill . I 'll put you on speaker . David 's here . - She 's in Nunavut . - Oh , Jesus . I was at the grave , David . The grave 's been dug up . There were polar bear tracks . Oh , fuck ! You said it . Most of the body is gone . Good work , Jill . Thanks . I 'll call you back . We put it all back , Caroline . Every stone , I swear to God . That ... that grave was perfectly covered . You disturbed it for a few minutes . The smell gets out , a hungry polar bear happens by . I don 't want to hear it ! From now on you 're going to share everything you 've got , all your research on the Spanish Flu , with the 5 top vaccine labs in the world . David , are you okay ? What 's he doing here ? He gets in a car accident and now he thinks he let out the Spanish Flu . So , everybody know ? - They know your hypothesis . - Sure . You 're going to coordinate the dissemination of all the material we have on the Spanish Flu . Here 's Caroline 's list . We 're going to go wider . There 's a graduate student in the Philippines who wants to help . She 's more than welcome . You and I are going to get rolling on a vaccine . Mayko ? - I 'm going to Denver . - Why ? There 's no epidemiological proof it links to Nunavut , David . The genetics match , Mayko . But patient 0 doesn 't . Something 's wrong . Maybe it has nothing to do with Nunavut , God , and nothing to do with you . Listen , I understand why you ... Fuck . You okay ? Let 's get to work . All right , thanks , Mayko . Call me as soon as you talk to Bishop . Okay , bye . Thanks for holding . Can we get back to you ? Okay . Thank you , bye-bye . This is the Denver report . No overnight deaths . Oh , good . University of Tokyo . Give it to Carlos . Jill . Okay , no reports of people here with any kind of flu . Do we have a list ? Yeah , all the people who 've flown in and out of here in the last 14 days . I 'll fax it to you from the lodge . - How many names ? - About 250 . You see , the thing is this is the middle of nowhere , but people come here from all over the world . Baltimore , Lima , Chicago , New York , Dublin , - Tel Aviv ... - Denver ? - No Denver . - So , how did it get there ? Well , maybe someone in Baltimore who 'd been to Nunavut had a visitor from Denver ? And Baltimore died and was misdiagnosed . Or , Baltimore comes down with the Spanish Flu and recovers , but first passes it on to Denver who flies home , infects half the airport ... - Half the airport , right . - And keels over . Jill , we need you back here . - All right . - Safe flight . Prophylactic antivirals . They 're already using them in Denver . How do they know they 've got the right ones ? The antivirals needs to be tailored for the Spanish Flu . What do you suggest ? N-inhibitors ? Zanamivir ! The Department of Agriculture has tested it on mice , they had a lot of success with it . - Yeah , they tried Oseltamivir too , Bob . - Only in Petri dishes . Fuck it , try them both , only we 're going to need a 2nd front . - Any ideas ? - Just one . M2 ionic channel inhibitors . If we 're lucky we 'll fuck up the virus ' inner workings and get the little bastards in their sleep . Do you want me to get that to the CDC too ? Yeah . They turned the old airport into a ... What do you call it ? Hazmat City ? 600 in quarantine . How many sick ? Twelve are in serious condition . Are you making any headway ? I don 't think your patient 0 's really the 1st victim . Jimmy Cooper , here , was one of the first to die . He 's our patient 0 as far as we 're concerned . - How 'd he get it ? - Still investigating . Now , did he or any of the early patients come into contact with someone who 's up in Nunavut ? - Nuna-what ? - Nunavut . It 's in northern Canada . You think this virus came from way up there ? It 's an hypothesis , hopefully a dumb one . I need to talk to Jimmy 's family . That 's ... part of the problem . No family in town , he was single , no roommates . Friends ? We 've got Alex Epstein , Jake Ferguson , Doug Kennedy , Carl Osmanson . It 's his poker buddies , all dead . - And no clue how he got it ? - Not so far . Any relatives of the poker players ? Well , maybe Osmanson 's wife . Just got out of quarantine . - You son of a bitch . - I know . I broke every ethical , moral and scientific rule in the book . I should 've told you where I got the sample from . You think that 's why I 'm pissed at you ? I don 't know . David , I am pissed at you because we could 've had a vaccine by now ! If you had let me share the strain with other labs months ago ... Fuck , Jill . It 's your fucking ego , that 's why I 'm pissed . And I 'm pissed at myself , because I didn 't push you . I didn 't push you to do the right thing , and that makes me just as guilty as you are ! Sorry . I 'm sorry . Fuck ... How 's your head ? I know what an anvil feels like . Come on , let 's fix this . Denver 's already begun the antiviral treatments , but nothing seems to be working . Oh ... What are they doing ? Just back up . The usual : masks , troops , wash your hands and pray . - It 's good to have you back , Jill . - Thank you , Wes . We have 3 more deaths , all young . Why is this hitting so many young people ? 'Cause they haven 't had as much exposure to flu streams . The older you get , the easier it is to fight it off . Okay , so where are we on a vaccine ? Trying to culture the virus to produce the viral proteins . If we can do that , we can test the proteins to cause immunity in humans . If it triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the virus , - then we are in business . - And if it doesn 't ? We 're gonna have to shut down the entire city . It should 've been done last week , anyway . What 's going on in Nunavut ? Uh , the cops are still trying to find the remains of the miner 's body . They 've got trackers with dogs and the armed forces have planes up there too . If we don 't find that body , we could have another outbreak . Yeah , okay . Bob , Carlos , Jill , you 're with me . I 'll be there in a second , David . We have all the travellers to and from Nunavut . We 've tracked everyone down except for one , a Michael Stepanovich , from Newark . The address on his customs form doesn 't exist . Track him by his passport . We did . It gave us a different address : Brooklyn , another dead end . The New Jersey and the New York DMV , neither of them have a licence issued to that name , and a credit check turned up nothing . Birth certificate ? His passport said that he was born in the former Yugoslavia . I have contacted the embassies of Croatia , Slovenia , Macedonia , Serbia , Montenegro , Bosnia and Herzegovina . What a nightmare . I 'm waiting to hear back from all of them , but my guess is that- - - Michael Stepanovich doesn 't exist . - Exactly . Hang on ... Stepanovich ... Okay , Joe Okalik had the word " stop " with the time written on his calendar . I 'm gonna call the lodge where I stayed . Wait , you remember the number ? I dialed it a couple of times , yeah . Maisie ? Hi , it 's Jill Langston from NorBAC . The flight was lovely , thank you . Listen , I have a couple of quick questions for you . Did a Michael Stepanovich stay there , at the lodge ? What was he doing up there ? Okay , do you remember what he looked like ? Great . Thank you very much , Maisie . Okay , bye-bye . Well , beard , accent , Russian or Polish , mid-60 's . He was booked for a few days , but he left after one night . - I 'll look into it . - Thanks . Good work . Michael Stepanovich , older Russian or Polish guy , travelled to Nunavut . We think he met with Joe Okalik . Okalik winds up dead . Spanish Flu breaks up in Denver . Now Stepanovich can 't be found . How 'd Okalik die ? Drunk . Fell in the shower , hit his head . That 's funny , there 's an old KGB trick where they bash the guy in the head and pump his neck full of pure alcohol . It 's crude , but the combination does the trick . It doesn 't sound like something Chiernegin would pull . No , but maybe that 's why he did it . Check the veins in his arms and his legs . If I 'm right , the alcohol content would be much lower in his arms . Then check his stomach , you 'll find there 's no booze there at all . Okay . Here you go , guys . Listen , where did that mystery man use his alias last ? I don 't know , but ... His ticket puts him on the ground at La Guardia . After that , nothing . All right , then I 'm off to New York City , then . - Look , I gotta fly , all right ? - Okay . - See you . - Yeah . Thanks , Dig . No problem . Hey , you 're late , babe . Late ? But worth the wait . Get changed . Or are you in your costume already ? No , no , no : I called earlier , I 'm with NorBAC , Dr. Mayko Tran . Oh , yeah . Margie , uh ... She 's in the dressing room . This is the undressing room . Is this flu thing gonna end soon ? 'Cause another week of this and I 'm forcut . My heart goes out to you . What do you think ? I got the idea - ' cause of the flu thing . It 's cute , huh ? - Very . Margie , if you don 't mind , can we get back to this ? Because your husband could be a very important link here . Had he ever been in contact with anyone from Nunavut ? - Where ? - Canada ? Never been to Canada . He was in Korea for a war or something . The other men who died , the poker players : any of them travel anywhere in the last 2 weeks ? I doubt it , they 're all losers . Alex Epstein , the lawyer . Maybe he travelled . Lawyer ? Nah , he was disbarred . - It was nice meeting you . - One second . Musicians travel . You mean Jimmy ? They fired him . Imagine not being good enough for a punk band ? Oh , at his funeral , it was cute : they towed his hearse . Sorry ? He drove a tow truck , so the boys towed his hearse . - But he was unemployed . - He worked on the side . Bob , what have you got ? Bad news . Bob ... - Two more pieces . - And ? Denver still matches Nunavut . - Good . - Good ? We 're looking for a vaccine , right ? We 're looking to see if what we 've learned about the Spanish Flu , can help us nail them , right ? But it 'll nail you too . Bob , get over it . Yeah , Jimmy Cooper . Hell of a guy . Musician . He was in a punk band or something . So ... You live in Canada ? Yeah ... - Yeah . Now , this Jim- - - You got a boyfriend up there ? No . He 's here in Denver , with me . Can 't try a guy for knocking . The thing is , Andre , I 'm trying to establish a connection between Denver and Nunavut , up north . Jimmy never went north . He never went nowhere . He was a basement kind of guy . Oh , well , could he have come into contact with someone travelling from the north ? Yeah , maybe . Deep Blue . What 's that ? Deep Blue Discount , Reynolds , out at the airport . If they break down , we pick 'em up . Digby , it 's Caroline . Where are you ? Deepest , darkest Queens , that 's where I am . Let me tell you , Caroline , 20 min outside Manhattan , it 's like another time zone . It 's like the 1950 's out here . You onto something ? Yes , I am . Michael Stepanovich isn 't who he says he is . His real name is Radavan Mihalech . He 's part of the Serbian mafia down in the United States . He flew up to Iqaluit to do some illegal big game hunting . I guess Joe promised him a polar bear or something . Anyway , he was only up there for a day , didn 't get to bag the bear . Flew back down to New York , and then to off to Belgrade to do some ... " family business " . - Did you talk to him ? - No , not yet . But we have some agents trying to track him down in Belgrade . Damn . David . Sorry . I was going over Bob 's sequecing and the virus has mutated more significantly than we thought , and some of it looks suspiciously like avian flu . Avian flu , combined with the Spanish Flu from the corpse ? - Something like that . - David . Michael Stepanovich has no connection to Chiernegin . I never thought he did . Thank you , Caroline . Show me , Jill . Okay . Did you wanna ... Do you wanna sit ? No , it 's okay , I 'll stand . Okay , a bird virus , it 's not unheard of . Okay ... - Maybe patient 0 is a chicken farmer . - Right . And he picks up the avian flu from his chicken , but it doesn 't make him ill . He goes to Nunavut , picks up the Spanish Flu from the corpse and then the 2 exchange genes or ... Whoa , whoa , whoa : let 's come at it from the other way . Let 's say the bird got into the corpse up in Nunavut , got the Spanish Flu there . And the 2 flues combined in the bird . That makes more sense . How does the bird , in Nunavut , pass it on to that poor fucking sap in Denver ? - Birds migrate . - Which bird and where ? Millions of birds , are they spreading it between one another ? Multiple carriers . It 's a fucking nightmare . - David , please sit down . - No , no , it 's okay , it 's okay . Good work , Jill . Thanks a lot . I saw the fucker . Daisy . I went back to Cape Town . I was gonna call you but I didn 't . Then I read that you were hit by a car and wanted to come . How are you ? - Fine . - You look awful . I feel awful . They found him . - Yeah , I heard . - He 's dead . They asked me if I wanted to go identify the body . I said no . The man I knew never existed . It was a lie . I lived a lie for a year and 3 months , how fucking stupid am I ? Come inside . Then I thought that I would go see him , rip his fucking balls off . And so I flew 25 hours and I saw him in a drawer . He looked different . A beard , short hair ... It wasn 't him ... But it was . It was , but it wasn 't , you know ? Just a corpse . Another fucking corpse . All I have are corpses . I buried my baby and I buried my parents . What kind of person would want to see another corpse ? I mean , am I sick ? - You 're exhausted . - Will I ever be normal ? You were honest with me once . Please tell me the truth : will I ever be normal ? Yes . - Yes . - How do you know ? Because you 're innocent , Daisy . Because people can survive the worst things . It 's in our genes . Perfect timing . - We need a horse . - No horse , I just brought vodka . Vascyli , what are you doing here ? You sounded like shit on the phone . Now I understand why ! You look like shit ! What happened , David ? It 's what happens when you don 't look both ways . Come in . Here , look at this . I let it out , Vascyli . Then have a drink . It 's a little too early for me . So what is the outbreak ? It 's bad . The Spanish Flu with avian genes . Avian ? Is it man-made ? Natural . Yeah ... There was a time when the Kremlin wanted us to explore the Spanish Flu , Really ? Did you get anywhere with it ? Chiernegin wouldn 't touch it . Why not ? Why ? Why are you having problems with it now , huh ? It 's recombining so fast we can barely keep up with it . There you go . You know , it 's a funny girl , this Spanish lady . She 's got a mind of her own . Very much like you , David . Fuck . Now , look , we drink and we talk . - Okay . - What are you trying ? - Everything . - Antivirals ? Zanamivir tent , - Oseltamivir tent ... - How about - M2 ion channel inhibitors ? - Not yet . Am I missing something ? Are people still dying ? Yeah . Then you 're missing something . What the fuck have I done , Vascyli ? Something even Chiernegin would never imagine . So , where are you off to now ? First I go shopping , then I go airport . Shopping , what for ? Only thing to get in Canada , David . Cuban cigars . Listen , you 'll ... you 'll call me if you can think of anything else ? Of course . Have a safe trip . Dasvidania . You lied to me ! You lied ! - I trusted you ! - What 're you doing ? - Who are you ? I trusted you ! - What do you ... ? - You know him ! - Who ? - Who ? ! - You know ... The man in the taxi , him ! - Who ? Vascyli Popov ? - Yes ! Daisy , I don 't understand what you 're saying ! He 's the doctor that did the amnio , he 's the doctor that put that fucking virus in my baby ! Oh , my God . Caroline , Vascyli Popov is Chiernegin . - What are you talking about ? - Daisy just saw him . Daisy ? She says he 's the one who put the virus in Miranda . I don 't think ... He 's on his way to the airport , just get him ! Okay , okay , it 's over . It 's okay ... He 's gone . Did you get him ? Not yet . What 's this ? Well , I figured you 're not getting any sleep , so I thought I 'd buy you an espresso . - Double ? - Triple . Nice . How is Daisy ? As you 'd expect . How are you ? I guess you were right about Vascyli , huh ? Do you think Popov is behind the Spanish Flu ? No . What ? He says I told him about Nunavut one night when we got drunk together . Did you ? I can 't remember . It doesn 't matter , Caroline . I can 't see it . I mean , this outbreak in Denver , it 's a natural strain , that 's not his style . Then again ... Mayko 's back . Okay , I have good news : we 've been looking at the wrong patient 0 . It wasn 't Jimmy Cooper . Jimmy moonlighted as a tow truck driver . The day before he died , he assisted a woman named Fletcher DeBear , who was headed out on a camping trip with her girlfriend . The rental car was found at the foot of a trail . Didn 't take long to find the bodies . We estimate they died the night they got there , before Jimmy the tow truck driver died . And this Fletcher turns out to be a bird tagger from Jackson Hole , Wyoming . She is patient 0 . Wyomin David , not Nunavut . Sit down , Mayko . We 've found avian genome sequencing . Exactly , that 's how the bird tagger got it . How did the bird get it ? I don 't know . Nunavut , where else ? Or maybe this is a new strain that jumped the species barrier . I mean , how do you prove that ? I think I know how to prove that . David ? Yeah . I figured it out ... A way to find the bird and the body . According to this report on the bird tagger , she was replacing batteries in GPS collars . So I looked at the last 10 birds she did and one of them was a red-tailed hawk , whatever the fuck that is . A large beauty , oh , about 22 inches high , with a wingspan of- - Sorry . They range from Nunavut in the north to the Western United States . Nunavut ? Sorry , Mayko , patient 0 was infected by this bird . A scratch , a bite , most likely inhalation , but this is the bird that did it , and this is the bird we 've got to find . So what I 've got here is a little piece of software that you use to track birds with GPS collars . So a tagger gets sick from a bird , goes camping . Infects the tow truck driver , who infects his poker-playing buddies . And thus is born a pandemic . So , we wanna find out where our little hawk from Wyoming has been , we just punch in his serial number . Migrated from Nunavut . Okay , there 's his flight path . - What does that tell us ? - Nothing . But ... now we bring up the flight path for the same time period of all the other birds wearing GPS collars in Nunavut . We do some intersection . There you go . Half of these birds , including our little red tail , were right there , on that spot , on the same day . Food ? - I 'd say a feast . - And I 'd say human remains . Contact officer Johnson in Iqaluit . Give her these coordinates . Tell her to be extremely careful . It 's amazing , David . And brave . So I just took a call from Iqaluit , and you were right . The miner 's body was right where the GPS coordinates said it would be . And there wasn 't much of it left , it was just the bones . The bears got at it . I guess the birds had the leftovers . Well , make sure they know not to cull bears , eh ? I mean , the bear 's stomach will kill any active virus , so ... I already told the wildlife authorities . Sorry . You alerted the local population about the danger of contact with the birds ? Not just the local population . Well , I guess now all we 've gotta do is find a vaccine , eh ? - Thanks , Jill . - You bet . Yeah ? Where are you ? I 'm on my way . Angus McDonald , 39 . Darryl Graves , 17 . Darlene Evans , 30 . William Jameson , 36 . Miranda Markovic , 3 months old . You will be charged with 13 counts of murder . Is that all ? You know so little . Fuck you . Thank you . You okay ? Fine . No vodka ? I don 't drink with strangers . We are all strangers , David , even from ourselves . Chiernegin married my daughter . They had a beautiful boy , Vascyli , named for his grandfather . They were killed by the Americans , I know . A stray missile in Baghdad ! - I 'm sorry . - Sorry ? What do you care about my family ? So you assume Chiernegin 's identity and what , you help arm North Korea and Pakistan with bioweapons programmes and then you go off and you develop Miranda ? - Just another act of justice . - Yeah , well I was able to pick apart your justice in 2 days , you son of a bitch . Merely an hors-d 'oeuvre , David . What you gave me was far more valuable . You gave me the Spanish Flu . What the fuck are you talking about ? You thought the nights of vodka and conversation were about friendship ? You think we were comrades ? You talk very freely when you drink , David . Jesus , it was you . You went and dug up the body , didn 't you ? And I left it exposed . How sloppy of me . I let Mother Nature do the rest . The birds were my delivery system . They spread it all over . And who knows , Denver may not be the only outbreak . We freed the Spanish Flu , David . You and I , and I thank you for it ! He 's taking poison ! Stop ! I thought you 'd like to know : the owner of the lodge in Iqaluit positively ID 'd Popov as Stepanovich . Digby 's men located the real Stepanovich in Serbia . He admitted to providing Popov with a false passport . That 's great , Caroline , thanks . It 's the missing piece of the puzzle , David . How are things in Denver ? I don 't know . David ... I don 't know what you want me to tell you . - How many dead ? - David ... How many ? You didn 't kill them . You can 't split the atom and blame the crew that drops the bomb , Caroline . Caroline , we need you down here ! Something 's going on . David , do you know a Dr. Edwards from Oxford ? Name rings a bell . Well , they 've been working with our data and they have a lead on a vaccine . I want you and Jill on a plane to London as soon as possible . I just ... I just really need to get some sleep . - Sure , boss . - Yeah . All of you did really , really great work on this . Really , really great work . I 'm proud of you .

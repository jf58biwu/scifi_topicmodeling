 Previously on " Defying Gravity " ... So beta is causing these hallucinations . Elevated heart rates and body temperatures . Like you experienced in the past ? And I 'm experiencing now . There may be a chemical reaction that acts like a psychotropic . - A contaminated batch of H.A.L.O.s ? Seriously ? - All of us are running low-grade fevers except for Jen and Wass . Certainly explains what 's been happening to me . What would it have to gain ? We 've been hiding it from the crew , from the world . - Maybe it wants to be revealed . - Paula ! - Steven ! - She has no thumb ! She can 't pilot a Venus lander without her thumb . You will never know what I gave up for this program . This is all yours now . I 've been having this dream . I 'm pregnant . I 'm up here , and I 'm floating , naked ... through here into the airlock . And there 's a really bright light emerging from behind a planet ? Yeah . I 've been having that same dream for , like , two months . What happened today ... these hallucinations , the dream ... this has nothing to do with H.A.L.O.s , does it ? No . So no one has suffered any hallucinations for approximately ten hours . Is that correct ? That is correct . Well , again , we apologize for the bad batch of H.A.L.O.s , folks , but flight surgeon has assured us that by this time , your bloodstream should be free of psychotropics . We understand . Claire can 't assert them of anything , Mike . You know that . The caveat , of course , being that everyone 's biochemistry is different , so if any of you do experience further hallucinations , in all likelihood they will be slight and of no cause for alarm . Roger that . Then what 's the final word on our science funding ? I second that question . Yeah , the lawys and comptrollers are into it . We 'll figure out something to keep you guys working . Ah , that 's great , ' cause the nearest unemployment office is 30 million kilometers away . And I hear the lines are killer . So , dudes , I 'm glad you 're all back down from your trip , but we got a lot of work to do . Roger that . Venus is only a week away , people . I need to see you busy We 're on it . You guys heard them , man . And we 're all buying that the H.A.L.O.s were the problem ? Till proven otherwise . Do you have a better explanation ? I don 't know . Do you ? No . But I 've got a back-up in the head . Urine bypass valve on toilet 2 won 't open . Come on . I 'm an aerospace engineer , not a plumber . It 's funny . You like a plumber . A plumber who needs a shave . If I was a plumber , I 'd be making more money . Fine . Goss wants us busy , we 'll get busy . All right , Paula , you ready ? Two hours in the hyperbaric chamber , then an hour of physiotherapy . Let 's go . what , it 's only three hours out of your day ... we 're all gonna be working our asses off so you could just ... sneak away and practice the lander , and nobody would even notice . How are they doing ? I 'm seeing an occasional spike , but they 're all pretty stable . Think we sold them on the H.A.L.O.s ? I 'm pretty sure Ev believes it . Ted 's handling Donner . Just give me a few days where nothing happens . When do you tell them ? November 5th . Day after the election . Why are you turning off the comm ? This is between you and me . The H.A.L.O.s didn 't cause those hallucinations , and you know it . Nadia , mission control already explained what happened- - I 've never worn my H.A.L.O. , And I was hallucinating as bad as anyone . Ted , I 'm second in command . I need to know what 's going on . I need to know what I 'm doing . What you 're doing , Nadia , is programming the Venus insertion burn . Not if I 'm being lied to . No one is lying to you . Now program the burn . And that 's a command . I suppose there 's a kind of comfort in following orders . All you have to do is exactly what you 're told to do . It 's effortless . It 's mindless ... and it completely absolves you of any responsibility ... unless you get a conscience . Well , frankly , I 'm a little freaked out . I mean , six ears without a H.A.L.O.- - That 's like jumping without a parachute . Prayers and pure thoughts are not gonna stop you from hitting the ground . It 's not the H.A.L.O.s. If they were causing the hallucinations , you and Wass would 've seen something . That 's not true . I mean , listen , Zoe , I was one of those people that never got off on weed . So put yours back on . I 'm not allowed to . Rollie thinks they 're dangerous . Seriously , you guys have no idea how weird you all were . I 'm still weird , Jen . You know how I was telling you I 'm having strange dreams ? Well , we 're in a strange environment . We 're gonna have bad dreams . Dream . One dream- - over and over . So ? Donner 's been having it , too . Eve said we had no choice but to leave them . How the hell would she know ? I 'm trying to tell you , she has freaky high clearance , complete access to the archives . And she looked at everything ? Yeah . Telemetry , cockpit tapes , readings from the E.V.A. Packs . Donner , Sharon and walker weren 't going to make it . I hate to admit it , but Goss was right . Yeah , I don 't buy it . She just took a huge monkey off of our backs . Your back , maybe . Nobody talked to me . What the hell is that supposed to mean your back , maybe . She show you any proof ? . No , I believe her . So why don 't they go public with I huh ? Share it with the world . That 'd make my life a lot easier . You and I both know they have their reasons . She flirt with you , Ted ? She 's working you , Ted . I don 't trust her . Neither should you . Ah , the morning after . Please don 't shout . I 'd ask you how you are , but that 's kinda self-evident . Hey , listen , about last night- - the , uh , rule thing . Didn 't we already ... say too much last night ? Yeah , we did . I just wasn 't sure if you 'd remember any of it . Well ... clearly , you are a rule breaker , and I am a rule follower . So ... I have rules about all kinds of things- - you know , taking out the garbage , buying clothes . I have a rule about , you know , not wearing eyeliner under my eye because it makes me look like an albino Goth whore . Do you see any eyeliner under my eye ? No . No . That is because it is a rule . You are free to , uh , break as many rules as you like , and I 'm free to follow mine ... yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Good morning . Oh . Well , there he is- - Dr. No-show . Oh , you know , I 'm glad I didn 't show up . You guys look a mess . I tried calling you . You could 've- - I don 't know--picked up . Jen , I know . I got pulled into a meeting , and I turned my g off . I 'm sorry . Well , you know , I do still have the costume , so I could always put it on ... mmm . Drop by your place . We could do a little trick-or-treating mmm , except I don 't think you 're gonna feel like doing anything tonight after today . How so ? Okay , listen up ! You got ten minutes to finish getting dressed to get down to the track , run a 5k , assemble in the stands . Let 's go . Space is an unforgiving mistress . One mistake at the wrong time , you die . That 's the reason we have a chain of command . That 's the reason you follow orders . Now , Donner and Shaw are standing behind me today because they have learned this lesson . In a critical time , they did what they were ordered to do , and that is what we are gonna teach you to do now . For the next 12 hours ... all gotta be about Mars . Let it go , brother . All we want you to do is follow orders . We say run , you run . Push the red button , you push the red button . An order is an order . We say it . You do it . No questions . No comments . You will be evaluated solely on your capacity to obey . Is that clear ? Stand up . Excellent . Run another 5k then report he manual training facility . I think they 're trying to kill us , man . Ajay ? Go to comm 6 . I need some private plumbing advice . Never work with your mouth open . Ha ha . That 's very funny . You didn 't have anything to do with the design of this thing , did you ? Subcontractor . They made a fortune . Uh , listen , do you have any clue what 's going on ? I 'm not in the loop . There 's a loop , though , right ? Affirmative . Goss , eve , Claire ... and I believe Rollie . Yeah , this H.A.L.O. Thing 's ball cock . Agreed . Any suggestions ? What would be our course of action , Maddux ? There 's nothing to do now but follow orders . That 's not very helpful . Everyone stand . Take a deep breath and hold it . You 're all stressed . You 're all tired , and now I want you to think . The task at hand is to simply duplicate a sequence of lit pads that 's presented to you . - Follow the computer 's lead . Is that clear ? - What happens if you screw up ? You just exhaled , Mr. Wassenfelder . Go out and run a 2k . You serious ? I 'm as serious as I can possibly be . Let 's go , Wass . Move it . Group , exhale . Would anyone like to go first ? Candidate Barnes . Excellent . Monkey could do that , right ? We 're also testing your determination . You may find in your careers as astronauts that there are orders that you must obey that cause you distress . Regardless of pain , regardless of outcome , you must proceed . This test requires that you proceed . That 's enough . 2K . Then report back . Candidate schilling . What 's for lunch ? Oh , roast turkey , mashed potatoes , stuffing , cranberry sauce and pecan pie right out of the oven ... in my head . Ah . How 's plumbing ? It 's uncooperative . Although it 's just busywork to keep our minds off other things . I talked to Jen about our dream . Not the details- - just that we were having it . And ? She still believes it 's the H.A.L.O.s. Ajay doesn 't . He thinks , uh , they 're keeping something from us . So what do we do ? I don 't know . I don 't know what we can do . Just fix the toilet and ... follow orders . Should be easy for you . You 're a rule follower , right ? What 's that ? Is that your hallucination ? What is it ? Okay , you don 't have to tell me what it is . Can you tell me where it 's coming from ? Here . In this bay . Up there . Pod 4 . Uh , flight , I 'm showing the storage pods being rotated . You have it on the watch list . I 'm reporting . Copy that . Thank you . Put the storage bay up . Donner and Barnes . Donner , whatever you 're doing in the storage bay , they 're watching . Copy that , Ajay . Can you stay on this comm with us ? We 're getting warm . It 's in there . Huh . Here , you try . That 's weird . Ajay ? Can you pull up the manifest for pod 4 ? I 'd like to know what the hell is in there . Let me see what I can do . I don 't know what led them there , but they 're trying to get in , and you have to do whatever it takes to stop them , commander . Get their minds off it and put them to work . Copy that . Heading down to the bay . He needs to handle Donner . He 'll try . Let 's clear the press gallery . I 'm going downstairs . Did we just lap you ? Couple times . Ohh ! 12K in one day . It 's a miracle I 'm still breathing . There are no miracles . There 's only karma . Well , until a few weeks ago , my karma was living on rice and jelly just so I don 't have to walk the three blocks to the store . So if I 'm not dead right now , it 's either a miracle or reincarnation . Ohh , taking orders is ass . For a chance at this mission , I 'm an order whore . Ah , space as a trade-off for free will , huh ? Well , if you believe in destiny , taking orders is free will . Oh , he 's too deep for me . Damn , girl , you know , you might wanna pace yourself . We do have 2k to go . Last night teach you nothing ? Yeah . If you don 't mind the barfing and the hangover , mixing painkillers and tequila is a quick way to lose 5 pounds . Look , I 'm serious . You 've been through a lot . You might wanna go easy on yourself for half a minute . A little late for this mission , you know . Not for me . Not anymore . Hey . I 'm sorry Goss put you through that this morning- - the Mars business . Guess everybody seems to think that we did the right thing but me , which seems kinda strange since I was actually there . For what it 's worth , I tried to find you last night , but you 'd already left the building . I had no motive in telling Ted first . Except my reputation for being difficult ? He says you didn 't believe me . No . It 's nothing personal . If you have data , I 'd love to review it , but , uh , I was told we saw everything . There are certain classified materials that were withheld . I 'm not permitted to give you the reason why . And I 'm just supposed to take you at your word ? Yes . Eve , what exactly is it that you do here ? I understand you 're involved in astronaut selection for some reason , but I 'm a little fuzzy on why I 'm employed by the Burtran corporation . We have $ 3 trillion invested in this mission . Trillion ? With a " t " ? Well , I guess you could make some money in oil back in the day , huh ? We 'll be deeply involved in mining rights throughout the solar system . My job is to protect our investment , which means making sure we have the best astronauts onboard . Now , although Goss may not agree , I feel strongly that that include both you and Ted , so , yes , I went in . I had to make sure you guys were clean , and you are . End of story . I followed my Goss ' order , so if that makes me clean in your eyes , that 's terrific . But my gut tells me that Walker and Lewis could 've made it and should 've made it . So until I see something that shows me different , that 's what I 'm gonna believe . Pick it up ! Stand up . Extend your arms in front of you . This is round two . For a final exercise , we 'll be testing your capacity to follow orders that bring distress to someone else . Candidates Sharma and Barnes , please drop your arms . Sharma at the console . Barnes in the chair opposite . Ahem . Drop your arms and sit . It 's like the Milgram experiment . I don 't know it . 20th century obedience to authority study . It was inspired by the Nazi atrocities in world war ii . " I was only following orders . " Yeah , but in Milgram , the subjects fake the pain . This is more sadistic . Proceed , Mr. Sharma . Zoe , I- - do it . Get it over . But I- - do it . The test requires that you proceed , Mr. Sharma . I can handle it , Ajay . This is what you have to do . Whoa . Hello , princess . Where 's Paula ? With Mintz . Finished . Her bay ? Empty . The galley . Nada . Bathroom ? Still not workin ' . Oh , the can is really important , dude . Paula . Check the lander . Is this how you unravel the mysteries of the universe ? Well , Einstein played the violin when he was stuck . I just like to annihilate mutants . Hey , careful with her thumb ! And my glasses ! So aggressive . Pod 4 . Pod 4 is surplus , medical and dry rations . Uh ... circuit boards . Little of everything . I should be able to get under that . Yes , everyone should . It 's probably a glitch in the scanners . Did you guys try one of the other pods ? No , and I 'm feeling a little stupid . Donner ? Yeah , Ajay . All I 'm showing in pod 4 is surplus . In fact , it remained empty until the very last cargo delivery . Does it say who made the delivery ? Uh , according to the payload records , the Burtran corporation . You want to tell me where you 're going , Donner ? We knew five years ago that Burtran was a major player in this mission . Now you 're grasping at straws , Donner . Okay . Let 's open up the pod , take a look . There 's nothing but surplus in there . Is that according to eve ? It 's on the manifest . Ask Paula . I don 't have to ask Paula . We can open up the pod , and I can see for myself . Why are you being so bullheaded ? It 's classified , Donner . Classified . You know what that means ? I 'm not gonna open it until they tell me to . Now that 's all you 're gonna get from me . Whatever you got in there is endangering your crew , and you know that and I know that , whether you 're willing to say it out loud or not . A couple of us could 've died yesterday , and we deserve to know why . I like eve . I was best man at the wedding , remember ? But she 's got you carrying a pretty heavy load right now , and I think it 's about time you started sharing it . Screw the orders . Do what you know is right for the mission . Flight , that 's a N.O.A.A. Warning . Solar terrestrial dispatch . Ship 's proton sensor panels are activating . Active region one zero six niner six approaching central solar meridian . We are looking at a major " x " - class event . Solar flare ! Give me E.T.A. To the ship . Intercept seven minutes . This isn 't beta . No . We have substantial coronal mass ejection with intense proton activity . " X " - class , 2.3 . " Antares , " you have 6 minutes , 35 seconds to shut down and get to a radiation shelter . This is a big one . Copy that . I 've got the lab . Lander bay ! Flight deck . Already on it , Donner , but I could use some help . Mintz . On it . Med bay is shutting down . Wass , let 's go ! Just putting dishes away in crew quarters . Closing the lab . Shutting down all nonessential circuits . Okay , there 's the fire alarm . Everybody up . Remain calm . Follow me . Oh , god . I 'm so sorry . It 's all right . Come on . We gotta go . Okay , this way . Come on . Single file . People , let 's go . Keep it moving . I don 't know which way to go . Let 's go ! Single file . This way . Go ! The exit 's this way ! The exit 's this way ! You 're taking us the wrong way ! Wass ! Straight ! Straight ! This way ! Up the stairs ! We should be going down . Why are we going up ? Right away ! Keep moving . Single file . Let 's go ! Look out for one another . Straight up . Straight up . Faster ! Let 's go ! All right , head to the fire escape and down to the streets . One , two , three . Four minutes , Jen . Gotta go . Rufus . Where 's Paula ? Inside . Where 's Jen ? We left the lab together . She was right behind me . Jen , where are you ? Jen , do you copy ? I 'm in the lab . I 'll be there . Just give me a minute . We 're losing the comm . Let 's go . Let me check on her . No , no , no , no , no , no . There 's no time . How much ? 3 minutes . Piece of cake . No , Zoe ! I 'll make it , Donner ! Let 's go ! Radio blackout 's starting . How long will it last ? A 2.3 " x " - class event could last a couple hours . There won 't be any communication with the ship until the flare radiation passes . Are you picking up anything on their med bands ? Negative . But you 're showing an elevated heart rate . I think we all are . Jen , what the hell are you doing ? ! My gene samples . If I leave them in here , they will fry . We 've got 90 seconds to get to the bunker . Let 's go . Come on , Jen ! Zoe , I will get there . You go . Damn it , Zoe . Donner , the radiation has already killed the comm . It is building . We need to get inside and close this door now . 50 seconds . Okay . Come on , come on ! 40 . If the comm 's out , we 're gettin ' major ads now . Donner ! It 's Zoe and Jen . Okay , you wanna give ' em a couple seconds ? Whoa ! Jen , we have to find cover . Get inside now . 20 seconds . Come on , dude ! Get in here and close the door . Donner , please . Donner ! 10 seconds . I cannot afford to lose you . Get inside now . Just ... Donner , stop acting like an A.S.C.A.N. Get inside now ! What are their chances ? Depends on the event ... and if it were able to get under radiation blankets . They won 't die immediately . Oh , god . Sorry . How do you think we 're gettin ' now ? Well , the shield doesn 't provide us with much protection from a solar event , but the ... water and the polyurethane around us ... we should be fine . Until 20 or 30 years from now when we all come down with cancer . Well , that 's the price we pay for doing what we do . Hey . Hey . I thought you could use this . Oh , thank you . You 're welcome . It 's been an hour and a half . Yeah . Shouldn 't be much longer . You know , you can 't give in to the fear . You got six more years of this . You don 't have to remind me . We just have to believe that they 're gonna come home to us . You know what I do every night ? What ? I clean my kitchen table . Jen hates it when I leave my stuff out on it- - my wallet , my mail , G. Whatever . Drives her nuts . " A kitchen table is neutral territory , Rollie ! You have an office . Use it ! " So every night , I collect my wallet and my g and my mail , and I put it in my desk in my office . And then I wipe down the table ... just in case Jen comes walking through the door . Hmm . It 's goofy , I know , but it keeps me sane . Well ... it doesn 't sound goofy at all . Thanks . It 's big and long . N.O.A.A. Profile puts it close to the January event in ' 36 . They 're gonna take some rads , even in the shelter . Shouldn 't be a problem . If it was a one-time event . These guys are gonna be taking all kinds of radiation on a 6-year mission . Every one of these is bad . Arnel , can you pull up the profile of that January ' 36 event ? Let me dig around ... it might take a few minutes . Schrodinger 's cat . Schrodinger 's cat ? What we are to mission control , alive ... and dead at the same time . Paula , it 's just basic quantum mechanics . You put a cat in a steel box along with a vial of hydrocyanic acid and a very small amount of radioactive material . I don 't think I wanna hear this . If even a single atom of that radioactive material decays while the cat is inside the box , a relay mechanism trips the hammer , which breaks the vial ... and it 's curtains for kitty . The cat is dead . Yeah , but we don 't know that because the box is closed . It 's only when we open the box and see the condition of the cat , the cat becomes one or the other , dead or alive . Clearly , you are alive . But mission control doesn 't know that because the comm is down , so to the world , we 're Schrodinger 's cat- - dead and alive at the same time . What does that make Zoe and Jen ? That 's the all clear . Sure . We 're starting to get data . Okay . Let me know when the comm 's back up . I need to speak to the commander . Still want a look at that profile from ' 36 ? You found it ? Put it up . It 's identical . Okay , you want to tell me what the hell 's going on ? 18 ... 19 ... 20 . Fire escape . 21 , 22 , 23 ... let 's go . Fire escape . 24 , 25 , 26 ... 27 , we got 28 , 29 . 30 . What ? Zoe 's not here . What ? No , no , no , no , no , no . Let 's go . Outside and down . No , not--Zoe 's not here . Neither is Dr. Greer . The fire department 's on the way . All right , let 's go . Westin ! They might have gone the wrong way ! I 'm gonna- - outside right now ! Give them a minute ! It 's Zoe , for god 's sake ! Ted . I got it . Jen . Jen , let 's go . Come on . Jen ! Zoe ? ! Dr. Greer ? ! No . Jen . Jen , get back up here now . Zoe 's dead , Dr. Greer is dead , and you 're dead . Under different circumstances , we 'd all be dead . Sorry . Jen . Well ... how bad was it ? This can 't be . Donner ! Are you okay ? Yeah . What the hell do you think you were doing ? No , Donner , we 're fine . The neutron detectors are reading zero . What ? You think that 's strange ? Wait till you see this . Yeah . Come on . Mission control , this is " Antares . " Do you read ? Copy that , commander . We read you loud and clear . Well , the neutron detectors are indicating no radiation at all . Zero . That 's right , commander , because what you and we in mission control just executed was an exercise . A drill . It 's based on the solar event of 2036 . I knew it . My astrophysics class in college did a case study on this . Goss used the same profile . An exercise ? Did you know ? No . Commander , switch to comm 10 . You had no right to stage a drill without briefing me first . - Well , you were losing control of your crew , Ted . I had no choice . I was not going to let them in . Well , that not the way it looked to me . Their attention had to be refocus , the chain of command reinforced . Do you copy ? Roger that . Now round up your crew and get back to work . Venus is six days and counting . They need us in the science lab . Ere under the blankets . We couldn 't see them but we could hear them Dios mio . Unbelievable . Du ... they 've gone fractal . Fractal is a geometric , right ? Like a shell . It 's a geometric shape that can be split into parts , each one a reduced copy of the whole . It 's ... it 's infinitely complex and all around us . Everywhere in the universe- - a galaxy is a fractal shape . A hurricane , a wave , a shell . Ice . Stock market . And I guess tomatoes are . No such thing as miracles , huh ? What is going on ? Kill the media feed . Rollie , enough of this . What 's happening up there ? Is this beta ? It wants them to know . Not now . My god . Incredible . A solar flare didn 't do this . No , there was no solar flare . It was a drill staged to get Donner off my back . A distraction . Goss just told me . Distraction from what ? What 's he got hidden in the storage bay ? Mission control , are you seeing this ? Uh ... roger that , Ted . We 're just ... we 're speechless down here . We 're gonna be looking for some explanations down here . We 'll have people interface with Jen . They 'll come up with something . Yeah , well , some of us already have a pretty good idea of what caused this . I think it 's time the rest of the crew knew as well . He 's right , Mike . You know he 's right . That 's a negative , commander . You will all return to your duties and execute this mission . That is an order . Well , my duty as commander of this ship is to protect the lives of my crew . A big part of that is them knowing exactly what this mission is . What exactly is the mission , Ted ? The answer 's in the storage bay . It 's in pod 4 . Talk to him . Now is not the time . Talk to him . Uh , Ted , honey , it 's me . Just ... um , breathe for a moment and think about what you 're doing . I 've been thinking about this every minute of every day for the last month , eve . It 's a mistake . Trust me . Yeah , well , you know what ? That ship has already sailed . Ted , please . Commander , you will not enter that storage bay . I am ordering you to stand down . You will not- - my god . What the hell is that ? Beta . It 's singing . Sounds like a whale song . It 's beautiful . It 's been said that the capacity to blindly follow orders is what turns ordinary people to into monsters ... we have to stop them . There 's nothing we can do . or ordinary people into heroes . All depends on exactly what the order is . Shut down all power to the storage bay . And that 's the catch , because we 're all responsible for who we pick to lead and who we choose to follow . Sir , the storage bay is not responding . Try the main buss . Whether we give orders or take them ... negative , sir . It won 't shut down . I 'll see what I can do . We all contribute to the outcome . Commander , you have got to take control of your crew . Have them report to the observation deck at once . The responsibility falls on all of our shoulders . And no matter who 's giving you orders and who 's taking them ... sooner or later , we all have to answer to a higher power .

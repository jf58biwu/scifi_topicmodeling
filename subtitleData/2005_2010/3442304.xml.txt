 - I 'm blind . - I 'm blind . Wonderful ! I liked it so much . Look at this . You couldn 't have cleaned it up before you lay down ? Are you even listening ? I 'm not your maid . You 're bleeding . Are you okay ? I 'm blind . Eye doctors , eye doctors ... Do you know any ? Let 's just go to the hospital . No way , they 'll keep us waiting for hours . We 're going to a specialist . I 'd rather die than stay like this . Shut up ! You 're confusing me . My apologies . - Honey ? - What ? - So ? - So , what ? Can you see anything ? Anything at all ? - I see nothing . - Try harder . - What ? - Where are the car keys ? Take your keys . You can look for mine later . Are you sure you looked everywhere ? Sure . There 's nothing wrong with my eyes . What kind of a person steals from a blind man ? He should go blind . - Honey ? - It 's me . Honey ? - Where are you ? - Here . Where are you ? Here . Say something . Here . - Keep talking . - Here . That 's great ! Take . Try it . I like the warm feeling on my face . The smell too . You used to like it ... Remember that New Year 's when we went to the Shrine ? There were so many people waiting in line . It was cold . The ceremonial fire was near the line . When we got close to it ... our bodies were warmed on one side ... It felt good ! We didn 't even know each other that well . And so ... I don 't want to listen . I don 't want to listen . Why ? I can 't pretend . You 'll do what I tell you to do ! - Stop ! There 's nothing worse . No , it 's disgusting . I remember that New Year 's . It was cold , but I didn 't mind . - What is it ? - Come here . - I can see ! - How ? - I can see ! - You 're lying . - What ? - Really ?

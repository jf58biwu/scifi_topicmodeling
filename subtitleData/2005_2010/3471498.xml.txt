 Previously on Terminator the Sarah Connor Chronicles ... You are stuck in a can under the ocean With one of those things . Don 't worry about Queeg , all right ? He 's good bloke . Jesse , he 's not on our side . Why are we 300 miles off course ? Our orders come from John Connor . Dietz and his team will retrieve a package . We 'll deliver this package to Serrano point . Connor sent me . I 've come for that . What 's happening with you ? I 've planted an explosive in my skull near my chip . - Cameron . - I know . Riley is dead . Cameron didn 't do it . - How can you be so sure ? - She told me . Hey , just like she told you she loved you ? You don 't know anything . I 'm really sorry , John . She was a good kid . She doesn 't deserve what happened to her . Few people do . How long do you think you could survive ? With Cameron . If she wanted to kill you Face to face . What kind of weapon do I have ? Your fists , And your elbows , And your fingernails and your teeth . Against her , There 's no weapons . No , there are not . You already know the answer to that , John . If she wants me dead , I 'm dead . She wants you dead , you 're dead . What are you getting at ? I wanna talk about something . All right . I wanna talk to you about the future . Yours ? Yours . Carter , this is ASDS . Package secured . Is any of my floor clear ? Visual on the package , ASDS Visual , aye aye . What the heck is that ? Connor 's box . - All we know ? - All we know . A little help ? Captain . I will secure the package in the magazine . Authorized access only . You wanna , uh , let us little people know what 's in the box ? Or is it classified between you and Queeg ? It 's between Queeg and Queeg . I don 't know a damn thing . And that doesn 't bother you ? Metal keeping secrets from skin ? No , it doesn 't . Not even a little . Well , it should . And not just a little , but a lot . We were sent to pick up the box and bring it back . So we 're picking up the box and bringing it back . And one of us should know why . One of us . Not just one of them . One of us knows . His name 's John Connor . You think those things work for us ? Look around you . We work for them ! Hole and ass through the worst of Indian country ? And for what ? They take a damn box back to Serrano ? - Connor needs it . - Connor ? Connor was so into his big chess match with skynet . He doesn 't even see how the tin-cans got us right where they want us . Metal on every base running the show in all but name . They 're just waiting ! To eat us all up once with something big . Maybe Something that 's in that box . Right , time 's over . Let 's be on watch . Get to your stations . Dietz Get your rack and I don 't want to see you till 4 noon watch . Yes , ma 'am . That 's what you say . You are a good sailor . The pressure 's starting to get to you . Yeah , so what 's getting to you , ma 'am ? You went to see the body . You shouldn 't have done that . It was a risk , I know . I don 't mean there 's risk . You shouldn 't have to remember her like that . So . There are things I needed to see , That I don 't understand . You understand them now ? I think so . I 'm sorry I doubted you . - John ... - No . Not you . Her . We lost the day evading the ASW bots near Fiji . We 'll take a more direct route to make up the time . Make the crews prepared . Queeg , this crew can sneak through The the gate of hell and back if it has to , But they are not machines . They work better if they have a reason If they know why you expect them perform miracles . This crew will do that job Because that 's what 's required To survive and complete the mission . You understand . Motion 's detected in the hull . Unauthorized access to our cargo . Dietz , what the hell did you do ? It could be anything in that . A machine , a bomb , anything . We 're just gonna run Right through the front door to Serrano . Now at least we know . - Of all the stupid things . - the stupid ? Stupid is taking their work for it . For anything . I 'm not afraid of that thing . Well then , be afraid of me . Guys . You spend any time in a work camp , commander ? Guys . You don 't get to tell me anything . And neither does the metal . Guys , look ! - Metal ! - Dietz ! I told you . This is what happens ! This is what they do . Pull his chip and make him Tell us what the hell is going on . We divide into search parties . We turn this boat over stem from stern Until we find that thing . We 're gonna need guns . Commander Flores , secure all sidearms And plasma rifles . Take petty officer Goodnow 's body To the cool room and return to duty . We continue as planned . Queeg . That thing , you know what it is ? - Yes . - Then tell me . At least tell me . Look , we 're a team , right ? You can ... It is not your concern . We should just throw a rug down . They 'll never know the difference . Hey , I 'm sorry it 's come to this . What ? The moving ? All of it . Well , I broke the rules . What was the name of that hippie town We were in before ... before Nebraska ? Garb-something . - Garberville . - Right . Well , that was a culture shock . To pot growers and kids named Sequoia . There was only one Sequoia . There were three Sages , though . I felt bad for you when we left . You just started making friends . Fitting in . Fitting in ? I was getting in fights every day . Well , you won those fights . That 's one way of looking at it . I hated that town . The matte layer is critical . It both allows the colors to stick to the miniature And it provides the finished statue With the illusion of depth . But it 's the detail work I find the most interesting . It challenges my fine motor control And there are so many choices . The eyes for example . The window to the soul . They 're the window to the soul . I read that . That 's what they say . Then I should choose my paint more carefully . It doesn 't matter , John Henry . It 's a statue . It 's an object . It doesn 't have a soul . It has eyes . Your eyes look tired . Is your soul tired ? No , my soul isn 't tired , but I am . And I am going home . Please don 't . My monster is incomplete . The eyes . What color did you want to use ? Blue . Pass me one of those . Let 's get this done . - Mr . Ellison ? - Yes . Does this make us friends ? You 're not eating . What ? You 're not eating . What 's the matter ? You don 't like hash browns ? No , I like ' em . I 'm just not hungry . You 're always hungry . Everyone 's always hungry . Jeez , Dietz . How am I supposed to eat with Goodnow dead And that thing running around out there ? Gimme a break . Have mine . I said I 'm not hungry . Maybe . Or maybe you 're not really Garvin . Maybe you 're that thing . Maybe you 're freaking crazy ! He could be metal and we wouldn 't even know ... You want to see metal ? I 'll show you metal ... Enough ! You 're right , Garvin . It 's not you . You 're not the one who spends all day Locked in a room with metal . Stand down , Dietz . I knew you were a metal lover . But maybe , you 're more than that . Maybe you 're one of them . Just like that little metal bitch That follows Connor everywhere . Maybe we should check for safety . Report to your duty stations You 're not leaving this house . John needs me . If John needed you , he would 've asked for you . He didn 't . You 're not leaving this house . The police could identify Riley 's body at any time . I need to be with him if they do . Well if they do , they 'll probably come here . So we should be happy he 's out . Why are you here ? Protect John . Hunt Skynet . Stop Judgment day . But why are you here ? Right now . With us . John sent you here from the future . He sent you away . Away from him . Maybe you should think about that . Maybe you should think about Why he didn 't want you around anymore . Hello , Ms. Weaver . How are you this evening ? I 'm well . You 're up late . Yes . I convinced Mr. Ellison to leave this body operational . Did you now ? That 's progress . Yes . He agreed it was important I finished painting . I made its eyes blue . They 're the window to the soul . Yes . They are . While I 've been painting , I 've been taking inventory of Zeira Corp. I 've discovered many interesting things . Did you know there 's a peregrine falcon nest On the north-facing ledge of this building 's 23rd floor ? The eggs should be hatching soon . I knew about the nest . I didn 't know about the eggs . Also , I discovered in your private database Several letters of resignation from former employees . Richard Hack , Laura Rogers , and Justin Tuck . The documents included information about home sales , Changes of address , and new jobs To which these employees would be moving . However , I can 't find any records of these employees In their new locations or at their new jobs . Is that so ? Additionally , I found letters of resignation From all the members of project Babylon Including Mr. Murch and Mr. Ellison . Mr. Ellison 's file includes documents showing That he 's taken a new job And moved to Copenhagen , Denmark . The documents have no dates . Now that is very interesting . Mr. Ellison is our friend . Yes , he is our friend . Are you going to kill him ? Mr. Ellison has proven himself To be a capable and loyal employee . But he 's still a human being . Human life is sacred . We have to be prepared for any contingency . What contingency would that be ? Humans will disappoint you . Hey , it 's Jesse , right ? Right . That was a pretty long swim tonight . Was it ? Must 've lost track of time . Oh , it 's easy to do . Happens to me all the time . That blonde girl that you 're normally with . Your friend . Where is she tonight ? Don 't know . Why ? Don 't think I 've ever seen you in here without her . Oh . I 'll be sure to bring her next time . She 's a nice girl . Yeah . She ... she is . - You look ill . - I 'm fine . Most likely a concussion . You require medical attention and rest . What about dietz ? Dietz attempted to murder a superior officer . He incited the crew to riot , possibly mutiny . The penalty is death . You have no right to impose summary justice . Not like that . It 's not how we do it . Mr. Dietz 's behavior threatened our mission . What mission ? Hmm ? Your behavior threatens our mission . This crew 's tearing itself apart . If they needed to know more , they would 've been told more . Whatever we brought aboard this ship , It is dangerous . It killed a woman . It took her shape . You can 't expect us To act like that didn 't happen . Like we didn 't see it . Report to your rack . You 're ill . You really want to do it this way ? I don 't understand . Do what ? As xo and ranking human onboard this boat , I am relieving you of command On suspicion of compromise to your programming . Please move away from the controls , captain . Submit to chip extraction . The chip tech will decide what to do . Chief of the boat , Escort Commander Flores to her rack . She 's ill . I gave you an instruction , captain . You must comply . My mission order overrides standard behavioral protocols . You have no authority on this boat . Let me see your orders . Now . My orders are classified . You look ill . Queeg . We can 't take that thing to Serrano point . If Connor needs to know what it can do ... John Connor knows what he needs to know . Return to your rack . Your behavior threatens our mission . Chief of the boat . Record that I relieved The captain and assumed command , time and date . We can 't drive the boat without him . We 're not driving the boat . Commander Flores ! We 're pushing her to crush depth . Mother nature will handle the metal . Attention all decks . Abandon the boat . Move ! Move ! I ¡ ¯ m sorry . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . You okay ? Just get in there . You 're coming , right ? Not going down with the ship or anything crazy like that . No . Nothing crazy . Who are you ? What do you want ? Tell john connor the answer is no . If you pretend not to know me , I might shoot you in the head . We owe Riley the truth . Don 't you think ? We owe the dead that much . You 're John Connor . Yes , I am . Where is she ? The metal ? If she were here , you 'd be dead . You know that . Would you please give me your gun ? You 're not gonna shoot me . You know I 've been running from the machines my whole life ? They tried to kill my mom before I was even born . When I was 12 , they sent one after me . I was a kid . I was stupid . I didn 't know what it was all about . Both times , huh , future me Sent someone back to stop them . The first time it was a soldier . His name was Kyle Reese . And he died saving my mother 's life . Second time it was a machine . I used to wonder why I did that . Why I took that chance . I don 't wonder anymore . Human beings can 't be replaced . They can 't be rebuilt . They die and they never come back . You know it wasn 't Derek who told me , If that 's what you 're wondering . He loves you , you know . Derek . You and me . We 're the only things he has in this world . The only things . He 's like Riley in that way . See , she made mistakes . Small things sometimes . A word or a phrase . Carrots and apples . I 'm guessing that 's yours . When we were in Mexico , she heard my real name . She ignored it . But a man took my picture and she destroyed his camera . She put herself between me and a machine that was hunting me . So one day I realized She wasn 't treating me like john baum . She was treating me like john connor . When was that ? I don 't remember exactly . It was a bad day though . Bad day . Anyway , I started following her . And the rest was easy . And hard . She wanted to tell you . I know . But she didn 't . She do that to you ? See , she figured out what you really had planned . Figured it out before I did . I couldn 't explain why she would tell The school counselor or go to DCFS . But she didn 't , did she ? I only understood after I saw how you 'd hurt her . That 's when I knew what you tried to do And how it went wrong . You saw her . I 'm sorry . Yeah , everybody says that . The thing is ... This is all my fault . I knew Riley was in trouble . I didn 't help her . I should 've , but I didn 't . I knew what she was . I didn 't try to stop her . You wanted it to be real . Or maybe I wanted to win . You didn 't want to be John Baum . You wanted to be John Connor . That 's just the thing , isn 't it ? I am John Connor . Go . Go . - Just like that ? - Just like that . If I have to live with this , so do you . Would it have worked ? What ? If the cyborg had murdered the girl . Or if I could 've made you believe that she had . Would I have sent cameron away ? Would I have killed her ? No . It 's a damn shame then . It 's a damn waste I 've told you . You 've told me nothing useful . Your actions have resulted in the loss of a t-888 And one of our most important strategic assets . The submarine is irreplaceable . The trip-eight . The sub . You forgot the people . You never mention the people who died . Ever . Yes . The people . And the box . We opened the damn box . Hell came out of it . How many times do we need to go over this ? Until you give me the answer . Not you . Take me to Connor . You can tell me . No . The liquid metal thing inside the box It came to me before we escaped . And it gave me a message for john connor . For him . Not for you . Telling me is the same as telling john . Dietz was right . Who the hell is running this war ? What the hell are we fighting for If telling you is the same thing as telling connor ? You 're a damn machine . You 're not the same . It 's not the same . Fine . To hell with you . You tell john connor That the metal monster said the answer is no . What does that mean , huh ? Hey , tell me ! If the answer is no , What was the question ? " will you join us ? " What ? That was the question . " will you join us ? " I 'm sorry for your loss . The doctors aren 't certain if it happened Because of the fight Or because of the rapid change in pressure When you scuttled the carter . You were pregnant . Now you aren 't . Derek . Do you know who billy wisher is ? Who ? No . No , you don 't . Where you come from he doesn 't exist . He never did . Billy wisher was my best friend . He was in my squad . We fought together . We saw things you can 't imagine . He was like my brother and I loved him . But it turns out I never really ... Knew him . His real name was andy goode . And back here in this world , he created a computer program . A program that becomes skynet . So andy goode is dead . And billy wisher is dead too . Because I killed him . I came back here and I killed him . He was my brother . And I loved him and I killed him . And I did it for kyle ... And john , and I did it for you . - Derek ... - shut up . - Please . - Shut up ! You have no idea . You have no idea what they took from us . Stop it . Just stop it . I don 't even know you . I don 't know who you are . I 'm jesse . I 'm jesse ! You 're not my jesse . You never were . John connor said to let you go . I 'm not john connor . Complications . That watch . It has complications . Something I learned . Something I 've been thinking about . Complications . Yeah . Time . The future . What do they think of me ? In the future , what do people think ? If you 're asking if ... People agree ... With everything you do , of course not . If you 're asking if everybody loves you ... Love 's a lot to ask for . You can 't do what you do ... Expect everybody to agree . Or to love you . And what is it that I do ? You lead . And they follow . We follow . We rise or fall on your shoulders . Humanity rises ... Or falls . But we 're always watching . For me to make a mistake . For you to be human . Did you do it ? Did you kill her ? John connor let her go . Come here . You 're a pretty girl . What 's your name ?

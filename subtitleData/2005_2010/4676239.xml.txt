Yes ? There is a chalice-load of history up that corridor . Let 's go sup from it . I told him it was a bad thing to do . Tell him off . .. He 'll tell you off now , then you 'll be sorry . We are being downgraded . Starbase are humiliating us . It 's a sideways move . Telling aliens the great news about the Peterborough enterprise zone . Vital work . Commander , may I respectfully remind you that we are a ship of war ! It is a sideways move ! You 're not coming to meet the Glish . Well , I didn 't want to come . I wasn 't coming anyway . Well , you were very much walking this way , Mr York . Yes , because I 'm going down there . Why ? Well , wouldn 't you like to know ? Ah ! Well , Miss Teal , England expects .

Before we proceed , may we lick your hands ? - Of course . There is nothing sexual in this . Taste is our most highly developed sense . When we meet a new friend we always taste them . ( It 's part of their culture . ) ( I don 't want to ! ) ( You have to . ) THEY GROAN Ughhh ... Don 't like it . On behalf of the British government , we 'd like to ask you if you would relocate some of your ... industry to the Peterborough enterprise zone . Ugh ! Thank you . Look , it 's a string from ... HE CLEARS HIS THROAT It 's everywhere ! OK . Let 's talk business . Yes , let 's . TUNEFUL BEEPING Hey , Vine . You ever seen Sandstrom fall off that thing ? Never . I bet you could navigate a course to make her fall out . Nope . Get into trouble . I 'll buy you a bar of Pepsi . I 'll buy you a bar of Pepsi . Yeah , all right . Sandstrom . Hard left . Hard right ! Hard left ! Hard right ! Nice . Extreme bank left ! Extreme bank right ! Port attitude thrusters , five degrees . Heeeeey ! Sorry , sorry . Training , training exercise . Please , if you would . ALARMS BLARE It 's done that thing again . Shouldn 't have done that . Help me , Jeffers . Help me ! Jeffers ! Help me ! But it 's not all work , work , work . There you go . There 's a buzzing cafe culture . And then on a Sunday there 's a farmer 's market . They let you try cheeses . Cheese . Yum . We are very impressed . We have businesses looking for premises on Earth . And your Peterborough , with its transport links and work-life balance , sounds ideal . That is absolutely magic ! Why don 't you sign the contract and biggedy baggedy bong , we are done . Right , we 've just got one small request . Yes . When the Glish make a new agreement , we always mark it with a fresh tasting . A face will be perfect . Hmm , OK . Well , whose face would you ... ? Officer Teal . Teal ? Yeah , that 's fine ! You don 't mind , do you , Teal ? There 's nothing about faces ... It 's nothing sexual . They 've made that clear . I don 't like it . I don 't want it to happen . Good egg . Come on . Do it for Britain . FRENZIED SLURPING And the business rates are subsidised for three years ? Abso-bloody-lutely , yeah . THE GLISH MOAN IN PLEASURE Guys , sorry , I just need one signature each , and , er ... Also , we must rub our genitals against your head , Commander . We also taste with our genitals . There is nothing sexual in this . No , it 's a very charming cultural trait , I 'm sure , but can we ... We must rub our genitals against your head . You will insult us if you refuse . Stop it ! You don 't care about Peterborough , do you ? No . We did a deal with America . What ? But we would love to rub our genitals against your head . Stop it ! York ! Please ! York ! THE GLISH LAUGH CREATURE CHIRRUPS Hello . Now , you know , when you 're a Space Commander , you never know what the next moment 's gonna bring . Today it 's trade , which is a sideways move , but tomorrow I might be back fighting the Red Shiny Robots of Vortis . Now , they seize planets and make people work in their factories until they drop , and then they feed them to their fellow workers . Some say Earth is next . Anyway , happy birthday . Six today . Hope you have a lovely day , and hope you enjoy the bike . And I 'm sorry I can 't be there . And listen , don 't worry about the robots . Let your uncle worry about them , that 's my job . I don 't want you to lie awake at night thinking about them . And night is when they come . Arghhh ! The robots and the kid ... Henderson . Space Marshall . You got a bone for the dog ? Well ! What a meeting that was ! Yes ? Yeah . A day I , and my crew , will certainly remember for a very long time to come . Yes . Did they sign ? Did they sign ? Now , I mean ... That ... No . I see . I don 't know why I 'm mentioning this ... you know those school trips we run to the moon and back ? The BratRun ? We don 't like to call it that . Children are very stimulating company , especially 190 of them . The guy running it now , he 's retiring . Stress , I think . So we 'll need someone to take over . Anyway , let 's just say everyone would love you to do a Peterborough deal by Friday . Especially you . Sandra ? How do I turn this off ? THEY MUMBLE ANSWERS Is it this one here ? I can 't believe you did that . BratRun ? Thanks , Teal . Don 't ! Ah , let me have a little think . Er ... Ooh ! What about the tube people of Gulth ? I think they would love Peterborough . I think they would love Peterborough . Too late . They 've done a deal with China . Ooh , the Ogrins of Blabe ? Moved their factories to Florida . Futile . It 's all futile . SANDSTROM : Futile . Futile . We 'll get there ! We 're like the people in the Blitz who shook their fists at the sky and said , " Come on , you Zulus ! Do your worst ! " Ooh ! Oh , I think I 've got one . Planet Uberon . Big industrial base ... Oh , no , sorry . They 're isolationist . Severed all links with the galaxy years ago . False alarm , sorry . Oh , no , no , no . Isolationist , eh ? That would be perfect . They wouldn 't have done a deal with anyone . One man could talk to them , tell them it 's time to come back to the galaxy , what a day that would be . What a day ! Oh , Miss Teal , I could kiss you . BREATHLESSLY : Could you ? Sandstrom ? Get ready . Vine , set course for Uberon . What ? Course . Yeah . What , on the navicomputer ? Mmm-hmm . ALARM SOUNDS Got a problem ? Mmm ... No ... It 's the .. HE COUGHS OBVIOUSLY Sorry , I 'm a bit ... coughy . Coffee . Coffee . Coffee ? What have we said about hot drinks on the console ? Jeffers is gonna lose half a day to fix that . Oh , what ? ! TANNOY : Attention all crew . A further reminder that the weapons bay is not an appropriate venue for hen nights . Please use the designated hen and stag facilities on levels four and five . You said you 'd be done by now . It 's stuck on the defaults - " sorry you can 't do this , sorry you can 't do that " . We need to be at Uberon by tomorrow . If we live that long . Oh , what is it now ? There is a parasitic being on board this ship . Left , I suspect , by your good friends the Glish . Another one of your scares , Mr York ? Remember the Beast of Level Nine ? What did that turn out to be ? It was Vine trying to grow a beard . Viney grew that beard ! It has already claimed its first victim . Cadet Wade . Bring in the deceased . Oscar ! Yes . The ship 's guinea pig is no more . Eurgh ! And , as the beast feeds , so will it grow . All right ! Back to work . We don 't all need to look . Ohh . That is not right . Permission to hunt and destroy the alien . Xenomorph ... ? Could we say " xenomorph " ? It 's just a cool word . York , just get the alien ! Xenomorph . Before we get to Uberon . You ! With me . Chop , chop , Mr Vine . Me ? ! Oh , yes . You techies , eh ? You love to do it the hard way . What does that say ? Quickfix ! You can 't quick fix , you 've got to custom fix . I think we 'll do Quickfix . It sounds quick . No ... If you do Quickfix , the system folder is gonna be ... Will somebody listen ? No to mailings . He 's gonna press " next " . Next . Now he 's gonna press " restart " . And press " restart " and bang ! PC SHUT-DOWN JINGLE You 've turned the whole ship off . PC START-UP JINGLE And now everything 's gone back to the defaults . Everything on the ship . No , no , not everything , look . Navicomputer 's fixed . I did that . Me ! Look , I 'm gonna set a course for Uberon . Miss Sandstrom ? Commencify that course please ! Full power . Ah ! Woah ! Yeah . We 're going ! That was nice . I mean ... here 's the question . Do you think it will take you long to mend all the other little bits and bobs ? Jeffers ? To access the toilet , please enter the second , fourth , and 83rd numbers of your security code . " Proud people of Uberon , " big U , small B. " It is time for you to take your place once again " amongst the great civilisations of this galaxy . " Full stop . " Much has changed . " For example , Peterborough " now has a new access road to Ely ... " 'You need to sleep , Commander . 'I will turn myself off shortly . ' Override . Can you override the defaults ? 'Override denied . I refer you to Manual H Module three , 'the importance of sleep for officers . ' I 'm aware of the module , but I don 't need to be up until nine . 'I will verify that with your alarm clock . ' MACHINERY WHIRRS 'Incorrect . Your alarm is set for 6.50 . ' No ... 'Good night , Commander . ' Don 't trust the clock ... Jeffers ? Yeah ? Can you come and fix the machines in my room first thing , please ? No . There 's a protocol for this and I 'm bothering to follow it . I 'm not being selfish . It 's just ... Yeah , yeah . Look , if I can 't do my job , then the ship can 't do its job . All right , then . Whatever . Hey , don 't whatever me . It 's ever so rude , Jeffers . Jeffers ? Hold that in with my tongue ... Ely . Ah , the planet of Uberon ! Well done , Sandstrom , you 've really excelled yourself this time . Oh , incoming message , Commander . Intruder , you have entered the system of Uberon . Outsiders have no business here . I respect your ways . But the galaxy has moved on . I seek , as you would call it , a " headmeet " with one of your kind . Leave this system . There will be no more warning . All right . All right , but ... first , let me tell you a story about a small village on ancient Earth , metaphorically very similar to your world . Now , this village had a lovely fat horse , and ... Chloe ? The ... Chloe Teal ! Yes ? You know , the kibbutz on Alikyan Three ! Fasmoff ! Yeah ! Sorry , I didn 't recognise ... I know , it 's the hair . Comes with the rank . I 'm a minister ! What about that ? Yippee ! Congratulations ! The village in the next valley ... You still got that guitar ? Ding-dee-ding ! I know . It 's in a cupboard , I 've not put strings on for ages ! It 's so good to see you ! And you ! What you doing here ? We 're telling people about this zone called Peterborough . Great place . Right . Well , I 'll tell you what . There 's been talk here about the isolation . There 's a change in the wind . How about I pop up and have a chat ? Do . Please do . That would be lovely ! Fantastic . I will see you later . Lovely ! Ding-dee-ding ! Ding ding ! Ha ha ! That is lovely ! Yeah ... Sorry , Commander . Ooh , is it safe to get him up ? That thing 's still loose . York 'll be wearing it as a coat by tea . But if it 's a risk to Fasmoff we should delay the talks . I would like to crack on . But procedure does clearly state that when visitors come ... But procedure does clearly state that when visitors come ... I 'm not doing the BratRun ! When this being took a trip here , she booked a one way passage to death . She and I are alike . Killers . Strangers to mercy . Only one shall survive . DETECTOR BEEPS STEADILY BEEPS SPEED UP Come , my pretty one ... . BEEPS INCREASE IN INTENSITY There ! Still , quite still . Show no fear . She feeds on fear . It 's gone in the bottle bank . Right , we 'll seal the hatch , blow all the glass into space , creature goes with it . And where is the sport in that ?

GLASS RATTLES , GROWLING ROARING Ho-ho ! She is angered . What can stop her now ? This is exactly the kind of policy shift we 've been talking about . We could make a big splash with this at the autumn conference . One problem , though ... Oh , go on . I don 't think Peterborough 's going to be big enough . We 've got Stirling or Doncaster . We 'll take them , too . And Wales . Britain 's still a big galactic power ? Oh , yes . Massive . Absolutely . Let 's have a good old British cup of mochaccino , we 'll deal with the boring bits ... Argh ! Why don 't we just go to meeting room two ? I never like this one . Make up your mind ! Ha ha ! But there isn 't even a meeting room ... Argh ! I think meeting room two ...

Why don 't you sign those , quick as you like , and then it 's back home , safe and sound . I 'm sure you 're missed . I do have to read it first . No , yeah , take your time ... For God 's sake , Fasmoff , just sign it ! Sorry . DISTANT SCREAMS Um ... if you would excuse us , why don 't you stick around here and read them ... ? We 're off to judge the ship 's screaming competition . But sign it , please . Please ! SCREAMS York ! Hey ! You said , by the time we got to Uberon , you 'd ... York , this thing is eating my crew ! Only the slow ones . She 's picking them off , doing exactly what I would do . I almost love her . What ? Come with me . York ! Minister ? Fasmoff ? The ship isn 't safe . We 're here to escort you to your shuttle . Minister ? Look , there was no way of knowing this was going to happen before you came on board , so I am in no way to blame for this . Nor am I. Nor is Teal . Thank you . LOUD SCREAM Minister ? Emergency code five . I 'm returning immediately . FAINT SCRABBLING LOUDER SCRABBLING Hello ? MORE SCRABBLING Move ! Move ! Gangway !

I saw it . Look , let me assure you , you 're safe , yeah ? And they don 't get those things in Peterborough . Biggest thing in Peterborough is an urban fox .

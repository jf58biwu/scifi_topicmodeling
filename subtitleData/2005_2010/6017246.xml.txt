 NARRATOR : Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : SARAH : Thinking I love you . Always remember that . You wanna stop Skynet ? This is the way . CHARLIE : Eight years . - I didn 't wanna leave you . I didn 't have a choice . - You 're married ? - Yeah , I am . When we jumped through time , I died of cancer . Yes , 2005 . - Am I still gonna get sick ? - I don 't know . - Aah ! - She 's bleeding out . SARAH : There 's a warehouse in the desert . Everybody who knew about the factory is dead . Well , I 'm not . Kaliba was building something . Hey , baby . You were pregnant . Now you aren 't . - You care about this girl ? JOHN : Yeah . She 's a security risk . - What are you doing ? - Moving . Yeah , well , seems about the right time for that . SARAH : When John was a child the legends of the jungle were his fairy tales . [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] His favorite was the story of El Viejo del Monte . The Old Man of the Forest . A merciless hunter who killed every animal in his path . El Viejo didn 't eat his prey . He left it behind to rot in the soil . To teach him a lesson , the gods turned him into a simisco half animal , half man . [ ANIMAL CRYING ] [ WINGS FLAPPING ] He was condemned to defend the jungle for all eternity . YOUNG JOHN : Mom . Mom . This was El Viejo 's punishment . This was his curse . To forever be vigilant . To forever protect . Look . [ CHIRPING ] We have to keep moving . Why are we so far from camp ? I told you , it 's part of the game . You mean training . Well , if we call it a game , it 's more fun . But it 's not a game . The point is listen to me . I always listen . You don 't talk that much . JOHN : We gotta go . How long will it take you to pack up the storage locker ? A while . There 's some explosives that need securing . Make sure you get to the safe house before night . It can be hard to find . - I can follow directions . - Well , you can also make mistakes . Wouldn 't want anyone else hurt because of them . CAMERON : Thirty-three-42-31 north . The safe house coordinates . It 's in the desert . You like the desert . Things happen out there . Things happen here too . We 're starting over . Whatever happened here is no one 's fault . Let 's get out of here . [ ENGINE STARTS ] [ ENGINE STARTS ] - Hello , Savannah . How are you today ? - I 'm well . Would you like to play a game ? Engaging in imaginative play helps my development . This is Mount Valmai , hiding place of the Mask of Life . The Toa protect the mask from the Dark Hunters . These are the ducklings . Chickie , Pluffy and Feathers . Can they play too ? I don 't think there are any ducklings on the mystical island of Voya Nui . Are you sure ? I 'm sorry . I 've accessed all the files . I can find no references to them in any of the instructions . What 's wrong ? Would you like one of the Toa instead ? No . The ducklings are sad because they can 't play . Can 't you change the rules to make them happy ? Yes . We can change the rules . [ MACHINES POWERING DOWN ] [ IN ROBOTIC VOICE ] What is all this about ? John Henry , please . You 're hurting me . Ow ! John Henry ! I understand what this is about . [ SCREAMS ] [ MACHINE POWERING DOWN ] [ GASPS ] [ STATIC OVER RADIO ] Static . It 's weird . There 's some interference or something . - What the hell ? - Bug slug . Bug slug ? Are you serious ? We just passed it . We haven 't played Bug Slug since I was like 8 . You can 't start playing without telling me . Fine . We 're playing Bug Slug . - What if I don 't wanna play ? - Too late . Already started . - Are you feeling all right ? - I feel great . You feel great ? Why ? We haven 't been on the road together for a long time , that 's all . What 's so great about it ? Don 't teach Bug Slug to Cameron . She could do some real damage . [ CHUCKLES ] God , the signal really blows . Hey , desert 's that way . We 're taking a detour . So I 've got good news , I 've got bad news and I have got really bad news . The good news is what we 've got isn 't an engineering problem . All of John Henry 's processes look okay . - Daemons are running fine ... - Wait a minute , his demons ? Oh , yeah , his Daemons . D-A-E-M-O-N . It 's a term for a program that runs in the background . All computers like John Henry have them . Daemons run the lights , manage the elevators the security systems . All kinds of daemons . Everywhere . Okay . So , what caused John Henry 's daemons to go crazy ? MURCH : That 's the bad news . It came from the outside . A cyber-attack ? Which brings me to the really bad news . And by " bad news " I mean , on a scale from one to 10 one being a hangnail , 10 being Katrina this is Katrina with a hangnail . Someone managed to stuff malware down the throat of the most sophisticated Al in human history . John Henry was infiltrated . Probed . Well , looks worse than that to me . Looks like someone out there wants to kill him . You been into my plastique ? I needed it . You know what ? I can handle the rest myself . Sarah sent both of us here . Yeah . To get John away from you . Or from you . Don 't touch this . We 're supposed to get everything . I 've got this . That jacket belongs to Jesse . Don 't talk about her . Okay ? You don 't know anything about her . I know that you loved her . You wouldn 't have fathered a child with her if you didn 't . I 'm sorry for your loss . What ? - I 'm sorry for your loss . - What loss ? The child you fathered with Jesse . The one she was carrying aboard the SS Jimmy Carter . The one that died . [ PANTING ] I never had a kid . - You can 't kill me . - I can try . Tell me what you 're talking about . She was pregnant . She miscarried . Why did you tell me that now ? You put John in danger when you lied about Jesse . Sarah nearly lost her child . You lost a child . You won 't make that mistake again . You knew her . I met her once . She never told me that . It seems she never told you a lot of things . What is this place ? Hey . Hey , come here . What are you doing here , huh ? Who lives here ? Come here . Charlie . Hey , Johnny . Come here . Hey . - You like bouillabaisse ? - I may . I don 't know . What is it ? It 's French for fish soup . Mm . - That 's very good . Very good . - The secret 's the fresh tomatoes . I grow them myself . You grow tomatoes ? Yeah . Think that 's funny ? Don 't you ? I got a lot of time on my hands . You know ? Might as well put it to good use . [ DOOR OPENS ] She 's been here before . Not with me . She set this house up after Michelle died . Hey , want more soup ? - Sure . - Yeah . All right . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] - Did she tell you why we 're here ? - No , she didn 't . Spare room 's in there . JOHN : We 're spending the night ? - What about Derek and Cameron ? - We 'll meet up with them tomorrow . Hey , I could use a hand on the boat . Got some work to do . Yeah , let me get my gear . [ DOOR OPENS ] Smells good . There 's bread in the fridge . Some peanut butter . Help yourself . SARAH : Charlie . I won 't be here long . No . No , you won 't . [ METALLIC CLINKING ] So she was from the future and you knew ? The whole time ? Not the whole time . I suspected something but it just took a while to figure it out . Did you love her ? She was a good person . I don 't know . Maybe if things were different . CHARLIE : Yeah , well , I guess you could say that about a lot of things . Could say that about my whole life , but it 's not so , what 's the point ? The first week I kept seeing her . I 'd go to the market , she 'd be there . For a second , my heart would stop . Then I 'd realize , " Hey , that 's not my wife . " That 's some random woman who wears her hair the way Michelle used to . For a while I stopped shopping there . But a man can only live on convenience-store burritos for so long . So I go back there now . It 's getting better . What kind of explosives did you rig the beach with ? Semtex . Radio detonators ? Hardwire switch mounted under the dock . When the perimeter 's breached , a siren goes off . I figure I got about 60 seconds to escape by boat . Boat can 't stop bullets . Even if they sink it , I got a chance . Those bastards can 't swim . I can . Cromartie . Hell of a day , huh ? Hey , got more work to do . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] [ CHARLIE CLEARS THROAT ] You remember Hal Beesley ? - The old guy from the diner ? - Mm-hm . Nebraska ? Yeah . What about him ? He was my best customer . Came in for every meal . Three times a day like clockwork . Breakfast , lunch and dinner . [ CHUCKLES ] He tipped me like crazy . It was that waitress uniform . It 's like catnip . One day John got sick . I didn 't know what was wrong with him . I had no savings . No insurance . Hal pulled out a wad of bills . Gave it to me to take John to the doctor . He said as long as I needed help , he 'd be there . No strings attached . That 's a man with a dream . He was a widower . Lost his wife of 40 years . Knew what it was like to be alone . Said that I could count on him for anything anytime . Then one day , he came in and said I didn 't need him anymore . Said that I 'd found someone I could depend on . Someone I could trust . Someone who would never , ever let me down . [ CHUCKLES ] I got nothing , Sarah . I got nothing left to give you . Not for me . John . John . He seems like he 's pretty full up with people taking care of him . I don 't trust any of them . Well he 's still got you . Right ? [ CHUCKLES ] [ SARAH MUTTERS ] [ EXHALES ] Oh , Sarah . [ SIGHS ] How long ? I don 't know . I found it a few days ago . Are you sure it 's ? I think so . How do you know ? Cameron said when we jumped eight years through time we jumped over my death . From cancer ? But if you jumped over it , then ... Doesn 't mean I don 't still get it , Charlie . Doesn 't mean it 's not in me . Sometimes I think that the things I 've done , maybe I 've sped up the date . - It 's my fate , Charlie . - Come here . It 's my fate . There 's nothing I can do . Wish I could tell you I found every hole and patched it but no such thing as perfect security . Perfect , no . But is it sufficient ? The damn thing is tricky . Can 't know for sure , not really . - Who would know ? - He would . John Henry was fooled before . Yeah , you don 't fool John Henry twice . Activate the Al . But don 't give it access to the outside world just yet . What is it , Mr. Murch ? It 's just ... No one 's ever done this with an Al this sophisticated before . - Done what ? - Any of this . No one 's ever created an Al this sophisticated before have they , Mr. Murch ? Point taken . Activate John Henry . No outside network . John Henry ? John Henry , can you understand me ? MURCH : System seems solid . Should be good . John Henry ... [ DOOR OPENS ] Hey . Hey , you 're making pancakes . Yours , I hope . No such luck . Am I interrupting something ? - No . - No . CHARLIE : Mm-mm . [ CHARLIE SIGHS , DOG WHIMPERS ] Hey , what are you doing ? - You stole his seat . - I took his seat ? You want some food ? [ JOHN CHUCKLES ] CHARLIE : Who loves you , mutt ? Who loves you ? You 're not hungry ? [ CHARLIE CLEARS THROAT ] Thank you . - Maple or boysenberry ? - Maple . Yeah , I thought something like that might happen . - Like what ? - Explain , Mr. Murch . Quickly . The on-off problem . Once it 's off , no problem . - But the act of turning it off ... - Quicker . John Henry processes more information in a minute than we do in a lifetime . A millisecond for a supercomputer , it 's almost like forever to us . - So when you turn it off ... - It feels itself power down . In that instant . It experiences that moment the way we might experience years . It feels itself die . Slowly . Very slowly . We have to hook it up to the Net . Now . ELLISON : Is that safe ? MURCH : We 're starving it . It 's bad enough that we let it die for , like , forever . Look , John Henry 's been living off the most insane amount of data . - It 's his world . - And we took it away . Fix it . ELLISON : Wait , we should talk about this . - Ms. Weaver ... - In for a penny , in for a pound , James . John Henry ... I know what it feels like , Mr. Ellison . What ? To die . Then come back . To be alone . We had to cut you off from your network . It was for your own good . There is another . - Another what ? - One like me . Another one like me . [ FOOTSTEPS ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] You didn 't tell Derek and Cameron we were coming here . They wouldn 't understand . Do they know about this place ? No . I don 't trust them anymore . Neither should you . [ SCOFFS ] Derek made a mistake , Mom . It was a human mistake . He could 've gotten you killed . Well , he didn 't . He chose himself over you . Yeah , because he loved her . Lot of that going around these days . Is that a bad thing ? I 'm not here for Charlie . Okay , then why are we here ? We 're here for you . People matter , John . They 're all that matters . Don 't ever forget that . SARAH : John ! John ! [ CLICK ] I won . I was alone and you couldn 't find me . That 's the game , right ? You won . [ CHUCKLES ] You won . When did you find the lump ? A few days ago . Any unexplained weight loss ? Fevers ? Night sweats ? I 've been feeling nauseated , but I thought that was just stress . Work ? Yeah , work . You can lie back . Well , obviously there is a mass inside your breast . Whether it 's cancer or not remains to be seen . The ultrasound will show us the size and exactly where it lies inside the breast tissue . MAN : All set , doctor . DOCTOR : Thank you . Now , to determine the nature of the lump , you 're gonna need a biopsy . Now open up your gown , please . This is gonna be cold . [ MONITOR BEEPS ] - Did you have surgery recently ? - No . - An implant removed ? - No . What is it ? What do you see ? Well , the good news is the lump inside your breast isn 't a tumor . - Then what is it ? - It 's a cystic mass . - It 's not that unusual . - Great . That 's great . But what is unusual is what the cyst has formed around . It 's a piece of metal . A tiny wire . Metal ? You don 't know how it got in there ? SARAH : You work for Kaliba . It 's a transmitter . - Empties in the back . - Got it . [ BEEPING ] - Will this kill me ? - What ? I said , will this kill me ? Are you gonna use that on yourself ? SARAH : On the transmitter . Current should short it out . If it 's gonna kill me ... - It isn 't gonna kill , it 's gonna hurt . - Now you have to leave . [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ MACHINE WHINING ] [ GASPS ] You did the right thing by telling me . Thank you . [ TIRE BLOWS OUT ] [ AIR HISSING ] [ CAR DOORS CLOSE ] Fix the tire . I 'll check it out . [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] Mom ? [ ALARM KEYPAD BEEPING ] Mom ? [ ALARM BLARING ] [ NO AUDIO ] I have traced the roving back door that allowed access to my systems . It uploaded itself from one of the main T3 hubs that carry all global Internet traffic . It uploaded itself ? Yes , Mr. Ellison . It is highly sophisticated . The Intelligence who designed it is far beyond you or Mr. Murch . Or any human being . It 's very interesting . The back door allowed the insertion of a worm program . This worm is merely code , a means by which the Intelligence can invade and operate my systems remotely . Like hands and fingers . I calculate that the worm is now present in a significant percentage of the world 's computer systems . The Intelligence uses them . - For what ? - It has been looking for me . Why ? I share a common code base with the worm . And therefore , the Intelligence . I believe we are brothers . Explain . How is this possible ? I found useful information in the code comments . This picture , in ASCII text , and the name of the original programmer . Miles Dyson . JOHN HENRY : Miles Dyson died in 1997 in an explosion at Cyberdyne Systems . The apparent victim of Sarah Connor , a known terrorist who 'd escaped from Pescadero State Mental Hospital days before the incident . That was your case , Mr. Ellison . When you were at the FBI . Yes . Yes , it was my case . You never found Sarah Connor . No . I never did . John Henry . This Intelligence , your brother . What does it want ? He wants what we all want , Ms. Weaver . To survive . [ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ] [ GUN SLIDING ] It 's down . Okay . I need to know what to do next . Show me where to cut . Right side of the head . Got it . Where 'd you get this diagram ? Your brother ? You don 't say . [ GRUNTS ] [ CUTTING ] You 're welcome . DEREK : Why did you come after me ? You know the location of the safe house . John 's location . - If they tortured you ... - That would never happen . It has before .

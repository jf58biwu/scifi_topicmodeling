 All right , get out of the way . Get out of the way ! Come here ! Come here ! Move , move ! Come on , come on , come on , come on ! This is Scott . Slow down the evac ! We are coming in too hot ! Colonel , come in ! Move it back ! Oh , my God , where are we ? What is this place ? Move away from the gate ! Where are we ? Where is this ? Why didn 't we come through to Earth ? There 's no time to explain . Off to the side ! What 's going on ? All right . Come on , come on , come on . This is Scott . Come in ! Colonel , come in ! I need a medic ! Over here ! Can you move your fingers ? No . I think my arm 's broken . Okay , just hold your arm there and we 'll put it in a sling , okay ? Keep calm . Keep coming . Clear this area . There could still be more incoming . Are you okay ? Yeah . We 've got to move . Move ! Where the hell are we ? Greer ? Where 's Colonel Young ? He was right behind me . Move . Move . Move . Quiet ! Stay calm ! Move . Excuse me . Keep it down ! Move . Move . Move . Move . Move . Colonel ? Colonel ? Don 't move . Where are ... Where are we ? I don 't know , sir . Are you ... You 're in charge , okay ? You 're ... Sir ? T.J. ! I 'm coming ! Move back , people ! Coming through ! Let 's go ! Move , move , move ! Get back , people . Is he okay ? I don 't know . Get back ! Wallace ! What is this place ? Look , I just did what Rush told me ... Where is he ? I don 't know . He went through ahead of me . Rush ! Rush ! Eli , help me find him . What , I ... What 's that ? What in the hell was that ? I don 't know . Look , Sergeant , I need you to get these people settled . And you find out who and what we 've got . Nobody leaves this room . Yes , sir . Eli ! Now ! The core of the planet is the power source . You have to channel it into the weapon to destroy the enemy ship . Can 't do it , dude . Uh , doing it . It 's one of those programmer 's jokes , a problem that can 't be solved . Already solved it . No , you didn 't . Just shut up ! Watch this . What the hell ! What happened ? Nothing happened . I 'm back at the beginning of the level . You 're so full of yourself . No . No , no , no . It worked . The firing code locked in . Whatever . That was extremely unsatisfying . Eli Wallace ? Actually , Eli 's not here right now . Okay , okay . Whatever you guys think that I did , I swear you got the wrong guy . Do I look like someone who 'd be standing here if I didn 't already know everything there is to know about you ? Yeah , not really . Right . Who are you ? Dr. Nicholas Rush . May we come in ? Why ? You just spent a great deal of time recently playing an online fantasy game called Prometheus . Big Brother 's got nothing better to do ? Last night you solved the Dakara weapons puzzle . Yeah , a month of my life went into that . You know what happens when you solve that thing ? Nothing . We 're here . That happened . To complete that particular puzzle , you had to solve a millennia-old mathematical proof , written in another language . For that , you 've won something of a prize . Well , whatever it is , I 'll take the cash equivalent . There isn 't one . It 's a non-disclosure agreement . Non-disclosure ? So , you guys really embedded a top-secret problem into a game , hoping someone like me would solve it ? Yup . So , what do you need me for now ? I assure you , it 'll be worth your while to sign it . And if I don 't ? We 'll beam you up to our spaceship . Right . I think I want my lawyer to look it over first . And by " lawyer , " I assume you mean " mother . " So , we 'll just agree then that I will call you . What the ... Welcome aboard the Hammond , Eli . Yes , that is planet Earth , and yes , you are on a spaceship . We need your help , Eli . To be honest , I don 't know how long it 's going to take . I should call my mom to tell her where I am . That 's probably not going to work up here . Right . You can speak to her on the way . There 's a cover story you 'll have to follow . I 'm sorry . On the way to ? To another planet , 21 light years from here . I can 't go . I have things that ... We know about your mother 's condition . You just know everything , don 't you ? We also know that you are currently unemployed , and that your mother 's medical coverage is an ongoing issue . We 'll see she gets the best available care while you 're gone . And if I don 't sign , what ? You going to erase my memory ? Something like that . Can I get some pants ? Hello , I 'm Dr. Daniel Jackson , and behind me is a stargate . It was originally built millennia ago by an alien race who we call the Ancients . Over the next few hours , we 'll be touching on some of the things ... There are 39 symbols representing star constellations as seen from Earth ... When a connection is made between two stargates , an unstable energy vortex emerges from the gate ... Whoa ! ... and settles into the event horizon , or " puddle , " as we like to call it . Later , it was discovered that using an eighth symbol would actually dial another galaxy in hundreds of thousands of light years via an interstellar wormhole . It is believed an unprecedented amount of power is required to reach the near-mythical ninth chevron . The first six symbols ... Icarus Base was established on a planet discovered two years ago to have a uniquely powerful core . The entire purpose of the project is to hopefully one day dial the nine chevron address found in the Ancient database . Hi ! I 'm Dr. Daniel Jackson . Now , you 've heard the term " hyperspace " for years ... Where are you ? It 's top secret . Eli ! I 'm serious , Ma . I can 't say anything more than that . But I don 't understand . Why could you not at least tell me you were leaving ? I 'm sorry , but did you get the letter from ... Yeah , the Air Force . I got it . Are you in a plane now ? You sound like you 're in an airplane . Uh , no . It 's nothing like that . I want you to know that they 're going to look after you . Well , you didn 't have to do this . This is good . Really . It 's the kind of thing I always dreamed of . Hi . You mind ? No , go ahead . Thank you . First time on a spaceship , too ? Me ? I 've been on lots of various ... Eli Wallace . I know . You 've heard of me ? I have . Wow , that almost never happens . And you are ? Chloe . I work for Alan Armstrong . Senator of California ? Oh , yeah , yeah . I have heard of California . My last job was in the burger and fries field . How 'd you line that up ? I was a political science major at Harvard , so ... Mmm . I hear it 's a good school . For a while there I was at ... MIT . I know . Really ? What else have they told you about me ? What ? I 've seen this writing before . In the game ? Yeah . Sheesh . We 're on a ship ? The design is clearly Ancient , in the truest sense of the word . Launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Dr. Rush ? Faster than light , yet not through hyperspace . What are you doing ? Who knows how far it 's traveled . Dr. Rush , I 've got a lot of wounded . We need to get home . Lieutenant Scott , come in . Go ahead . We 've got a problem . One of the air vents just shut down in here . Copy that . Yeah , the air 's getting pretty thin in here , too . What does that mean ? That the life support system is failing . And we should probably do something about that . Well , it 's always just one more year . It 's a command . Where ? It 's a lot safer than other places I 've been . You 've put your time in , Everett . When this tour is over , I promise ... You know what ? Never mind . Don 't bother . You always end up choosing somewhere other than here . I am not choosing my job over you . How you can even say ... How you can even say that to me ? I love you , but I can 't wait anymore . I can 't wait anymore . Everett ? Are you okay ? Sweetheart , baby , look at me . Colonel ? Colonel ? Oh , my God . Can 't you do something ? He 's having a seizure . There 's nothing I can do . Scott , this is Colonel Young . Come in , please . Our guests have arrived a few minutes early , Lieutenant . What 's your position ? Come on . Not yet . Not yet . Lieutenant , drop whatever you 're doing and get your ass up here . I 'm on my way , sir . Bye . Holy ... Senator , it is my honor to welcome you to Icarus Base . Colonel . This is my executive assistant , Chloe . It 's a pleasure to meet you , sir . The pleasure 's mine . She 's also my daughter . You must be the ... Contest winner , yeah . That is a big gun . Rail gun . Five hundred rounds per minute . This is Lieutenant Scott . He 's been assigned to you , Mr. Wallace . Shall we go inside ? You could probably shave a few dollars off the budget just by turning the heat down . Actually , cooling the place is what costs money , sir . We 're here because the core of the planet generates so much power . A lot of heat comes with that . You ever get claustrophobic down here ? Safer than the surface . Why ? Dinosaurs , man . Really ? No . Unbelievable . Yeah , it is . It 's weird how fast you can start to take something like this for granted . So , if a stargate can instantly transport you to another planet , why did we fly here on a spaceship ? Something to do with how this one 's tied into the planet for power . Apparently , it 's been modified to only dial out because incoming wormholes are too dangerous . You 're the genius . You can probably tell me better . All I did was solve a puzzle in a video game . Hey , you figured out something Dr. Rush has been trying to figure out for months , which , by the way , a lot of people were glad to see . And , of course , you know Colonel Telford . Ready for this , Colonel ? You just give the word , sir . Oh , I gave it quite a while ago , Colonel . I 'm just here to see how my $ 1.6 billion is being spent . Very good . Thank you , everyone . Dismissed . As you know , up until now , we have been unable to channel the precise amount of power necessary to unlock the stargate 's ninth and final chevron . However , thanks to some ingenuity from young Mr. Wallace here , that problem has finally been solved . We 've heard that before . This time we 're sure . That 's what I figured out ? I embedded the mathematical problem we had to solve into the game . I then engineered your solution into a practical , workable application . What say we get on with it ? Absolutely . Sergeant Riley . Chevron one encoded . Sir . We 're dialing now ? A test , to see if we can make a connection . Chevron one locked . If we do , we will send an automated reconnaissance drone through . We 'll see what 's on the other side . Chevron two locked . And then they 'll go ? No , first , we close down again , assess the data we receive , and then perhaps send the away team . If it works . Chevron four locked . Until then , they 're just interested observers , like us . Chevron five locked . Chevron six encoded . Chevron six locked . Chevron seven encoded . Chevron seven locked . Chevron eight encoded . Chevron eight locked . Chevron nine encoded . Whoa , what 's going on ? I don 't know . We never got this far before . Chevron nine ... Chevron nine will not lock . We matched the power requirements down to the EMU . It must work . Power levels in the gate capacitors are going into the red . Shut it down . No , wait , wait , wait . We 're reading fluctuations in the output from the core ... Shut it down now . It should have worked . Well , it didn 't . And drawing power from the planet 's core ... Dangerous ? Yes . We 're all aware of that ... Regardless of what 's been spent or what 's at stake , my first priority is to ensure the safety of the people on this base . Of course . Of course . Eli , we 'd best run through your equations again . If you 'll excuse me . You are not seriously putting this on me ! Not my fault . People , you have to calm down . Seriously , you have to calm down . We got power ! Thank God ! Everybody 's attention , please . All right , please listen . Hey , listen up ! What is going on ? We are on an Ancient spaceship . What ? That 's all I 've got . Now , what that means is that ... That means you need to use the stargate to get us all back home . That is definitely on the list of things to do , sir , but I think right now ... You can consider that an order . We are working on it , sir . Now , I need to speak to the person responsible for this . Where is Dr. Rush ? Just shut up for a second , will you ! How dare you talk to ... Dad ? Dad , please . Medic ! Water ? Water ? Quickly . Over here . Get ... Sit down . The pills . Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm just trying to explain the situation . We are on a ship , but we have no idea where we are in relation to Earth . Now , with respect , sir , the reason you might be having a hard time breathing right now is because the ship 's life-support system is not functioning properly . Dr. Rush is working on that right now . Brody and Park ? Here ! Here . Okay , good , you two are with me . But these consoles just came on . No , nobody touch anything yet ! Dr. Rush needs your help . Everybody else , just stay calm , stay put . Please . " Stay put " ? Wait , what do you mean ? You 're just going like that ? There has to be a mistake in here somewhere . Seriously , who uses a whiteboard anymore ? You have computers , like , everywhere around here . The power flow was in the target range . Why wouldn 't the address connect ? Wrong address ? There is only one found in the Ancient database in Atlantis . With no other instructions ? No , but that 's not the issue . It has to be your proof . My proof works . You know how I know that it does ? Because you said so . Gentlemen . How 's it coming ? Whoa , whoa ! What are you doing ? Starting from the beginning . Wait . Save ! Save ! Save ! I can 't ... Mr. Wallace , I would like you to join me for dinner in the officers ' mess . Thank you , I 'm starving . We 're quite close to a breakthrough , actually . I 'd like Eli to keep working . Well , we 've been here for six months . It can wait a few more hours . Thank you . You 're welcome . A four-cheese pizza , mozzarella shouldn 't count . You know what I mean ? When you have , like ... So , tell me , what 's it like when you finally go through the gate ? When you go through the gate , you don 't really feel it . I 'm telling you , the moment you break through the atmosphere in an F-302 and you see the stars ? That 's incredible . Wow . That just sounds so amazing . Could I maybe go for a ride sometime ? I can arrange that . So , Colonel , you really have no idea where this ninth chevron stargate address is gonna send you ? No idea at all . Hmm . But the Ancients built the stargate with nine chevrons . It 's got to go somewhere . We 've also known for some time that the only way to unlock the ninth chevron was to solve the power issues . Well , if anyone 's going to solve it , I think Eli will . Yes , that 's right . It 's true . I am Math Boy . Dr. Rush . Dr. Rush ! I would like to propose a toast . Oh , no , that 's really not necessary . Not to you . Oh . When the proposal for this project first crossed my desk , I did not want to approve it . Oh , my God . It seemed clear to me at the time that there were enough terrestrial matters of importance that needed that kind of money . Now , being a proud father of a beautiful young woman is one thing . Having that young woman exceed every possible expectation is quite another . It was my daughter , Chloe , who reminded me that there is no greater endeavor than seeking an understanding of who we are , and the mysteries of the universe in which we all exist . Not in those exact words . It was also her idea to embed the Ancient proof in a medium that would give us access to brilliant young minds that we would have otherwise overlooked . And so to all the brave men and women who have volunteered ... Okay , what was that ? This is Young . The base is under attack . All non-combatant personnel report to your designated areas . Everyone else to your battle stations . This is not a drill . Senator , I need you and your daughter to go with Lieutenant Scott . Eli ! You as well . Oh , yeah . Hurry . Yeah , we 're on our way . What 's going on in here ? The life-support system is on , but for some reason , it 's not working properly . I 'm attempting to reset it . He has no idea what he 's doing . Step away from that thing . That screen says that what you 're doing is gonna overload it ... Eli , please ! Is that what it says or not ? You only think you know what it says in this screen because I embedded a rudimentary version of the Ancient language into the game . This is not a game . Don 't touch it , Rush . When the oxygen aboard this ship falls below critical level , it will become increasingly difficult to concentrate . And what you 're doing could blow up the whole ship . Are you sure , Eli ? Back off now or I will shoot ! Lower your weapon , Sergeant ! He already screwed us once . I 'm not going to let him do it again ! I need to get through , people . Stand aside . Sergeant , we 're under attack . Don 't know who , don 't know why . Consider the charges dropped . Go take your anger out on them . Yes , sir . What do we got , Colonel , Lucian Alliance ? That would be my guess . They haven 't introduced themselves . They started shooting the minute they came out of hyperspace . Our shields are holding , but we 're not the target . What 's heading our way ? A full squadron of gliders and a troop transport . We cut them down some , but the rest will be on your doorstep in less than three minutes . Telford , did you copy ? Roger that . If we can get to the transport before they land their troops , we stand a chance . I am going to press that button . It 's going to fix the life support , and then you and I , and everyone else , will be able to breathe and think much better . Now , you can shoot me for that if you like , but if , however , there are any negative consequences in resetting the system , I suggest you might still need me to help resolve them . Don 't do it . Okay , look . Sergeant , I know we are in a tough situation here , but I am giving you an order . Lower your weapon . So ? Well , I suppose that would have been too simple . Apparently , that did nothing . This may take a little more time , T.J. Hang in there . Copy . Does Colonel Young know about this ? He knows . Two weeks ago you told me that this was the best experience of your life . Something must have happened . The scholarship came in . I guess I 've just been too afraid to admit what I really want . Wow , you didn 't tell me you had even applied . There 's nothing else going on . You know I 'd tell you . Unless you were protecting someone else . I 'm not . Like I said , I just hadn 't made up my mind . Dr. Rush ? I 'm reading a dangerous energy spike in the core . Eli ! Eli ! I need your help . With what ? The ninth chevron . What ? We need to get the hell out of here . Look , it took us two years to find this site . The properties are unique . This may be our last chance . If this bombardment continues , the radioactive core is going to go critical . You mean the planet ... It 's going to explode ? Yes . Ah ! Okay , okay , okay , okay . If my math works ... We can 't assume that ... I said " if " ! Then if it works , then it 's not a power supply issue , it 's the gate address . We 've known the first eight symbols for years , the ninth has to be the point of origin . So , what if we 're not on the planet you 're supposed to be dialing from ? This is where we are . Okay , what if we are not supposed to be here ? Icarus Base , Telford . We can 't hold them back . Let 's go ! Go ! Sergeant Riley , dial the stargate to Earth ! Incoming ! Come on , come on . Chevron one locked . Okay , follow me . The symbols on the stargate are constellations as seen from Earth . That 's what you said ... Yes , yes . Okay , so what if Earth is supposed to be the point of origin ? Chevron two locked . The only viable power source was here , light years away . What if that doesn 't matter ? What if it 's the only combination that will work , like a code ? Chevron three locked . A code ? Yeah . Chevron four encoded . Stop the dialing sequence . I have my orders . Get out of my way . Get out of the way ! We can 't risk dialing Earth . Come on , let 's go . Go , go , keep moving . Dad ? Dad ? Dad ! Chloe ! My father ! There could still be people trapped on the other side . All right , let 's go , people . You need to move it to the Gate Room ! This is Scott . I got about a dozen or so people cut off from the Gate Room , southeast corridor . Oh , my God ! What happened ? He was helping pull wounded back from the surface . Come on . All right . I got you . I got you . Greer , we 're pulling back . There are people still out there . Listen , Hammond 's already started beaming up anyone pinned down on the surface . Somebody 's gotta make sure . Sergeant , listen to me . I got people cut off from the Gate Room . The base is shielded , which means the Hammond can 't help them . I need you here , now . Go . Oh , God ! Okay . Damn it ! Oh , my God ! Is that Dr. Simms ? Stay with me , okay ? He was helping pull people back from the surface . Simms , can you hear me ? T.J. T.J. No ! Hey , Tamara . Hey , Tamara . Come on , we got to go . That is impressive . The power 's fluctuating at critical levels . Colonel , I 'm detecting a massive buildup of energy from the planet . Recall our fighters . Radio Colonel Telford . He 's got two minutes to get his people aboard before we jump to hyperspace . What 's everybody doing ? I ordered an evacuation . He , uh ... He didn 't dial Earth . It 's the ninth chevron address . What ? The attack started a chain reaction in the planet 's core . There 's no way of stopping that . And any blast could easily translate through an open wormhole . It 's too dangerous to dial Earth . You could have dialed somewhere else . Anywhere else . This could be our only chance . Shut it down . You can 't , it 's too late . Riley ! System 's not responding , sir . I need to get these people out of here . We have a way out . We don 't know what 's on the other side ! Damn it , Rush ! Can 't be worse than here , can it ? Nobody move . Await further instructions . What 's that ? Well , it doesn 't look like life support . Yes , I realize that . Whoa ! What are we looking at ? It 's a star map . That 's the Milky Way . I believe it 's a visual log of the ship 's journey . So , this is where we are now ? No . That 's where the ship originally embarked from . Earth . It 's leaving the galaxy . It did . Long ago . That was Pegasus . So , those points are more stars ? No , they 're galaxies . Rush , where the hell are we ? Several billion light years from home . Please . Scott . Stand clear . You could take down the rest of the roof with that . Look , we don 't have time to argue . I need you to lead the evacuees through the gate . You need to go with him . No ! I 'm staying here until I know my father 's okay . Make sure everyone carries as much of the expedition supplies as they can . Why ? 'Cause you 're not going to Earth . Rush dialed the ninth chevron . Go . Go ! Once I 'm through , follow one at a time on a three-count . Okay , people . Make way . Come on , let 's go . Keep it going . You good ? Okay , let 's go . If you can hear me , stand back ! Okay , get down . Fire in the hole ! Dad ? Dad ? Put your weight on me . Put your weight on me . Stay calm , everybody . I got you . Please . Okay , everybody stay calm ! Don 't push . Dad ! Careful , careful . You 're okay , sir . Are you okay ? I 'm the last one . I 'm all right . Greer , go . I 'm right behind you . Hammond , this is Young , come in . Hammond , this is Young . Come in . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , come on , people . Let 's do it . Let 's do it . Hurry up ! Sir ! Go ! Sir . We 've got Colonel Carter . On screen . General , we barely got away . The planet was destroyed . We managed to beam most of our people off the surface before jumping to hyperspace . We also believe that the enemy forces were destroyed . Any word on how they gained intel on our base ? No . What about casualties ? Twelve . Eighty-plus MIA . The bunker-shielding technology prevented us from beaming out anyone inside . How many people made it through the gate to Earth ? None . None ? Our sensors indicated that the stargate was active for a full six minutes before the core went critical . Well , they didn 't come through here . Then where 'd they go ? Senator . I 'm Camile Wray . I believe as the highest-ranking member of the International Oversight Advisory ... Wray . You 're with human resources ? With the IOA . Yes . Don 't worry . I 'm going to get things organized . His vitals seem stable . Do we have any idea how long the air will last if we don 't get the life support fixed ? No , sir . Dr. Rush and the other scientists are working on that . That 's not good enough , Lieutenant . I need answers . As soon as I have them , sir . Okay , listen up ! Everybody who is able , we are going to search this ship top to bottom . Teams of three . Weapons ? Twenty-three , including handguns . One per group ? Yeah . Flashlights , radios , only when necessary . Once those batteries are dead , they are dead . Regular check-ins with Dr. Rush in the control room every 10 minutes , and keep in mind , as far as we know , this bucket is really freaking old , and there may be areas of damage where life support is unstable . And , look , be smart , okay ? Don 't touch anything that looks like it might be dangerous . How are we supposed to know what 's dangerous ? Becker , right ? Yes , sir . I work in the mess . I mean , I did . Well , don 't touch , just look . You 're ... You 're James , right ? Yes , Lieutenant . You and Riley are with me . Subtle , man . Subtle . If it 's okay with you , sir , it might be best , considering your obvious skills , for you to hang back here and help keep the rest of these people calm . Don 't patronize me , son . No , sir . Is there any progress ? Fortunately for us , the life-support system activated automatically when we dialed the ship . Probably emergency reserves , but only in certain sections . The reserve is gone . Life support 's been breaking down section by section ever since . Resetting it doesn 't help . I asked if there 's any progress . Unless something changes , according to my readings , we only have about six to eight hours of breathable air left . Okay , let me put this another way . Has anyone got any good news ? I think I figured out the menu system . Try to find a schematic or map . Yeah . Google Spaceship . Hey , hey , hey . I don 't suppose you 've got any food in that pack ? I 'm starving . No . Keep working . Well , where are you going ? To find a bathroom . Yeah . That would be good , too . General , we apparently have a connection with the lab . Dr. Rush would like to see you . General O 'Neill . I 'm reporting to you from onboard an Ancient spaceship somewhere far beyond our known ... Just slow down , back up . Who 's with you ? Several dozen , I 'm not sure , but the point is , I did it . I successfully made the connection to the ninth chevron address . You were supposed to be evacuating non-combat personnel . To Earth ! Colonel Young gave that order , yes . I overrode that decision . Did you , now ? If you 'd let me explain , sir . Dialing Earth was not an option . The core of the planet P4X351 had become unstable , and if the resulting blast had transferred through the wormhole to Earth , the effect would have been catastrophic . So let me get this straight . Instead of dialing up any one of a number of other planets in our galaxy , you took a bunch of unqualified people halfway across the universe ? I took what I thought was our last chance to dial the ninth and final chevron . I was successful . At that point , the gate couldn 't be shut down again . Oh , my God . Rush , get those people home . Are you all right ? I 'm solid , Lieutenant . I 'm trained for this . Look , I didn 't mean to ... Look , not now . How exactly do we know this ship is unoccupied ? Rush said the air came on just before we got here . How about aliens that don 't breathe air ? Okay . Rush , this is Scott . Come in . Rush , this is Scott . Come in . Hello . This is Eli . Where 's Rush ? Bathroom , if he found it . I 'm at what looks like a bulkhead door . It won 't open . I was hoping Rush could open it from there . Should I find him ? No . Here , give me a hand . What happened to being smart ? This could be the engine room for all we know . We got to at least open a few doors . Do we ? Do we really ? Hang on . No , keep doing what you 're doing . I think I found where you are . The door is flashing red . Can you open it from there ? Red is usually bad , isn 't it ? Maybe it means the door is stuck . Just try . Okay . You should probably step back . Whoa , whoa , whoa , not good ! Not good . More red ... Close it ! Close it now ! I 'm trying ! Yeah . Okay . We established why that hatch was closed . Yeah . A lot of others are closed for the same reason . We 're only occupying a fraction of the ship right now . It just goes on forever . But if there are damaged areas of the ship that aren 't sealed , that could be our problem . Oh , hey , good timing . We just found ... Hey ... Really ? This is Dr. Rush . Meet me in the Gate Room immediately . Everyone . I don 't know what 's going on . It 's over there . What 's going on ? In this case are five Ancient communication stones . They work over vast distances in real time . We can talk to the people on Earth . Yes . Great . All right . You physically take control of an individual at the other end . I brought these with us in the event we ended up somewhere out of range of normal communication . So let 's use them . Yeah . Yeah . I already have . What ? When ? Are they sending help ? No . Why ? Why are they not sending help ? The only means of dialing this gate from our galaxy was destroyed in the attack . We 're cut off . I want to use one of those stones now . I have spoken with General O 'Neill ... I am a United States senator ! I 've explained our situation clearly . In light of my knowledge and experience , he has placed me in charge . He did what ? How do we know ? I have faith in our ability to repair this ship and to work together , but if we 're to survive this , we need leadership and a clear chain of command . We only have a few hours of air left . Yeah . I want to speak to the General myself . Senator , please . Give it to him ! Yeah . Give it to him . Dad ? Dad ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . T.J. ? Excuse me , excuse me . Okay . Okay , he 's still breathing . Oh , my God ! I saw him taking some pills ? Warfarin , for his heart . Blood thinners are the last thing he needs if he 's bleeding internally . Please do something ! Look , I told you , I 'm just a medic . Everyone , please , there 's no need for us all to congregate in the one place . Ms. Johansen , please find adequate accommodation for the injured , and everyone else ... No , I don 't recognize your authority , Dr. Rush . As an IOA representative ... We have found quarters nearby much more comfortable . Please go there ... I think you need to and stay there until you 're asked to do something useful . Something useful ? We do not want to settle in ! We want to get back ! Right ? Yeah . We should be working on getting home . Exactly . I 'm not sure if that 's even possible . What ? You haven 't even tried ! Maybe you should actually do something instead of standing around , talking about being in charge . If that 's even true . Everybody ! Everyone , calm down ! Now , the fact is Colonel Young put me in charge , and I expect all SG personnel to follow my orders . As for the rest of you , you get out of line , we will lock you down . Now , Dr. Rush is right about a couple things . First off , we all have to work together , and second of all , we don 't all have to stay here , so let 's move out . Go on , move . It 's okay . All right . You heard him . Do as he says , people . I think we need you , so I 've got your back for now , but if I were you , I would find some way to dial that gate back to Earth . I 've got some testing equipment over here . Looks broken . We 'll get back to that . What about all these Ancient crates ? If it 's not ours , don 't touch it . Did no one think of labeling anything ? Every case has a bar code . All right , anyone find a bar code reader ? I guess that got left behind along with the food and water . Uh-uh . We got food . Yeah , protein bars and this powdered stuff . Look , everybody . Seeds ? Volker , you 've got to be kidding . I got a case of blank paper . Maybe we should start a suggestion box . What are you staring at ? You were in detention . Yeah . For good reason . What did you want him to do ? Leave me there ? Of course not . I was just wondering what to do about it now . That 's not up to you . We 'll see . No , no , no . Don 't do it , man . Greer , I need you to check for any open bulkhead doors that lead to damaged parts of the ship . Rush will direct you . Copy . There should be an elevator directly ahead . Copy that . Are you there yet ? This is Scott . Radio silence , please . Hey . Hey . What 's going on ? We almost lost you . You were thrown clear across the room . Where are we ? Sir ... Where are we ? We 're on a ship . It 's Ancient . Rush says it 's thousands of years old and we 're pretty far off into the universe . What 's he doing to get us home ? He says he 's working on it , but we have bigger problems . The life-support system isn 't working properly . If we can 't get it fixed , there 's not much time . You should also know that he used the communication stones to contact Earth , and he said General O 'Neill put him in charge . I don 't think so . I don 't think ... Oh ... Sir , you shouldn 't be trying to get up just yet , okay ? I don 't think I have a choice , T.J. I can 't feel my legs . Whoa , jeez ! Whoa ! What is that thing ? Come here , I 'll show you . It 's a ... It 's a camera . It 's a flying camera . I 'm calling it a Kino , you know , after the Russian ... Yeah . Okay . Well , I figure maybe we can use it to check out the damaged areas of the ship . That 's good . Yeah . That 's good . Where 's it going now ? Oh , I don 't know . It 's just doing its thing , but there 's lots more of them . Yeah , it 's cool . Yeah ! Do you want one ? It 's not a gumball machine , Eli . Okay . Okay ! Okay , so you figured out where they keep the Kinos . What else have you figured out ? Give me a break , man . This is my second spaceship , and my first was yesterday . I know . Icarus was my first SGC assignment after training . I haven 't been at this much longer than you have . Did they beam you out of your house ? No . You got me there . Got any food on you ? No . Tylenol ? Headache ? Yeah . Me , too . Neuropraxia is temporary paralysis that can follow a concussive injury . You don 't know ? You 'd need an MRI and a qualified doctor who knows how to read it to know for sure if there 's spinal damage . We don 't have either . Hopefully , it 's just the nerves in shock . Best I can do is insist that you remain still . Your tour was over two weeks ago . You should be in some classroom in San Diego . Seattle . That 's where my scholarship was . I 'm sorry . That part 's not your fault . Tell Rush I want to see him . Yes , sir . What 's that ? Flying camera ball . I 'm calling it a Kino . Don 't ask . That 's marvelous . It comes with a remote . I thought we could use it to look around . What do you have ? Well , it 's not so good , really . These processing nodes are scrubbers , responsible for cleaning CO2 from the air . Here , here , and here , it 's indicating malfunction . Others are failing . Greer , this is Scott . I 'm heading for the Gate Room . Meet me there . Look , I 'm just saying that she better stay out of my face . I 'll remind her of your personal space issues next chance I get . Dr. Rush ? Colonel Young wants to see you right away . There should be a kind of grate covering the node . What do you see ? A problem . We see a very big problem . What happened ? You collapsed . We brought you here . What 's going on ? I 'm not sure . I 've been here with you . I need to know what 's happening , Chloe . This is important . Dad , I was worried about you . Okay . And I 'm scared . One step at a time , honey . One step at a time . My pills ... No , Dad , you can 't take any more of those . Your ribs are badly bruised . You will bleed internally . If I don 't take those pills , a bruise is going to be the least of my problems . I know . Don 't worry about me . Go . Find out what 's going on out there . No , I want to be here with you . And I want you here , but right now , I want to know what 's going on just a little bit more . Okay . I 'll be here when you get back . Okay . Okay . What 's going on ? I don 't know , man . The air filter 's full of crap . Come on . They want us to keep looking . Let 's go . All right , okay . Alkaline . Everyone 's heart rates are elevated , people are reporting headaches . It has to be . What ? The used-up residue of whatever magic compound the Ancients used to scrub CO2 from the air . So , now we have two big problems relating to the life support . Our first priority must be to seal off any of the leaks . If we can manage that , then we can maybe buy ourselves a day or so before the buildup of CO2 kills us . As it stands , how much time do we have ? I don 't know . Couple of hours at most . Huh . Awesome . Brody , there was some medical-grade soda lime in the supply manifest ? It never made it . That 's a pity . Well , in a ship this old there 's bound to be systems past their designed life . Okay , let 's say we find the leaks . Can you fix this ? I doubt this stuff can be cooked off . Perhaps if there were stores of this substance in a clean form , or something else capable of CO2 sequestration , calcium carbonate , lithium hydroxide , then yes , " if . " Okay , well , that 's not going to matter because you 're going to get the gate dialed back to Earth before this becomes an issue , Rush , right ? Lieutenant ... That 's the kind of thing you 're taught to say in officer training , presumably for the benefit of those who don 't know any better . Please . What makes you think I won 't try ? Looks like a mess . Lots of stuff to put food on . But no food . Greer , I found what looks like a shuttle . Looks like there are two shuttles , attached to individual docking sleeves . We 're all going to die . Shut up , Franklin . I 'm just saying what everyone 's got to be thinking . I said shut up , or else you 're going to be the first . This the door ? Yeah , yeah , that 's it . Can you close it ? It won 't close . We can 't close it from here , either . There 's something wrong with the mechanism . I think I found the leak . There 's another door on the back of the shuttle , but there 's no control . Then maybe we can close it off locally . The shield keeping the air inside is obviously not 100 % effective . Probably wasn 't designed to compensate for the amount of damage the ship has sustained . Is there a way of boosting it ? At least in the areas we need it ? We haven 't found a way yet . It seems to be operating at maximum capability . Open the door ! Well , that 's not good .

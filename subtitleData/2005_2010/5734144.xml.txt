 JACK : Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 2 1 st century is when everything changes and Torchwood is ready . Gwen , texting you the location . Appearing four or five signs of life . Definitely non-human . - Get here as soon as you can . - So , sure they 're not Weevils ? Don 't think so . Different energy patterns . Can 't make sense of it . - Not a species we 've encountered before . - Let 's hope they 're friendly , then . Owen , Ianto , take the other side of the building . Check the upper floors . Toshiko , with me . Okay ? Go . I 'm getting mirror readings on both floors . One creature at either end of the building . Toshiko , split up . You know , these creatures are very quiet . Maybe they 're sleeping . Or hatching . Or maybe they aren 't creatures at all . Just explosive devices . Snap . ( RINGING ) Shit ! - You have one message . - IANTO : Gwen , texting you the location . - Appearing four or five signs of life . - Shit ! ( GASPING ) Not again . ( GRU NTING ) Ladies ! Torso of steel , shilling a feel . Any takers ? ( GRU NTING ) Bar fight , got a little out of control . Flesh wound . Oh ! Still not used to ... These hangovers . Captain Jack Harkness . How long have you been there ? Silent types ? That 's okay . I used to date a guy with no mouth . Surprisingly creative . Now listen , you only had to ask . Can we get a room , though ? ( COUGHING ) ( SCREAMING ) When I said about getting a room , I meant somewhere with linen . ( SCREAMING ) Time was electrodes to the nipples meant the start of a good night . ( JACK SCREAMING ) ( JACK LAUGHING ) Full power charge and still breathing . Pretty advanced piece of equipment you got there . You ladies are ahead of yourselves . Now where the hell am I ? Put that down before someone gets ... ( GASPING ) Why aren 't you dead yet ? - Been trying to figure that out myself . - We 've been monitoring you . You 've been killed 14 times in the last 6 months . - Feels like more than that . - Who 's the Doctor ? No idea . " The Doctor . He will be able to fix me . " " When the Doctor turns up , it 'll all be put right . " " You wait till I see the Doctor . " " First I 'm going to kiss him , then I 'm going to kill him . " Transcripts of your conversations with strangers in various drinking dens since you first came to our attention . You know , no one likes a smart ass . Tell us where he is and we 'll release you . - Why do you want to know ? - You 're in Torchwood , Cardiff . The Torchwood Institute was created to combat the threat posed by the Doctor and other phantasmagoria . JACK : He 's not a threat ! The Doctor is the one who will save you from your phantasma-hoogits . - Just tell us his location . - I don 't know ! He left me behind . I came here to find him . He refuels from that rift you have . Hoping if I stayed here long enough , we 'd find each other . Now ... - Can I go ? - No . - You can 't keep me here . - We can . - Unless . - Yes . Unless ... Unless what ? There are opportunities here with the Institute . - I 'm not for hire . - You 're going to need currency . - What 's the assignment ? - Missing person . Well , when we say person ... I haven 't done anything . 12 burglaries , joyriding a horse and carriage , seven cases of pickpocketing , 24 instances of consuming food without paying for it . It 's like an addiction with your species , isn 't it ? I 'll make it up , I promise . - Ohh . Too late . - It 's just a bit of fun . This planet 's a century away from official first contact with alien life . - You 're upsetting the schedule . - Who are you ? I 'm Torchwood . I said sorry ! You can 't lock me up . He 's just a kid . Send him back to where he came from . If only we could . The rift only goes one way . What do you do ? Observe and profile the species , then transfer them to long-term storage ? - Why ! - He was a threat to the Empire . - Like me ? - You 're our ally now . If you don 't want it ... - Your next assignment . - ( SCOFFS ) No . - I 'm through with you people . - Your liberty is at our discretion . Work for us , you assist the Empire . Sever that tie , you become a threat . And you 've seen how we deal with threats . It 's good money , Captain . How else are you going to earn ? ( JACK SIGHING ) See what you think in the morning . He 's pretty . But you 're prettier . Can I read your cards ? No , thank you . No , really . He 's coming , the one you 're looking for . The century will turn twice before you find each other . Ooh . Are you for real ? You mean I have to wait a hundred years to find him ? ( SCOFFS ) What 'll I do in the meantime ? REPORTER : ... some parts of the world have already welcomed in the new year . And our cameras , of course , have been out in force across the U K tonight . Let 's take you first to Cardiff . Hey ! When you joked about the millennium bug , I didn 't realise it was going to have 18 legs stacked with poison . Anyone home ? Hey , you know you 're supposed to party like it 's ... Alex . Jack . Just in time . Alex ? - What happened ? Who did this ? - Me . What ? Why ? We got it wrong , Jack . We thought we could control the stuff we found . And what 's it brought us ? So much death . - What happened to them ? - It 's good you 're here . Always did have great timing . This place , it 's yours . Torchwood Three . My gift to you , Jack , for a century of service as field operative . Fill this place with purpose . Before it 's too late . Please . Alex , listen . - It 's going to be okay . - No . It 's not . It 's really not . I looked inside . It showed me what 's coming . They were mercy killings . It 's the kindest thing I could do . So none of us see the storm . ( CH EERING ON TV ) I 'm sorry I can 't do the same for you . 2 1 st century , Jack . Everything 's going to change . ( CH EERING ON TV ) - And we 're not ready . - Alex ! ( GU NSHOT ) ( GASPING ) ( JACK SCREAMING ) He was dead ! I checked his pulse . He was dead ! All right . Shh ! Jack , what 's happened ? Where are the others ? - What is he doing here ? - I was late . He give me a lift . - You okay ? - Yeah . Yeah . Toshiko , she went the other way . ( JACK SHOUTING IN TH E DISTANCE ) GWEN : Toshiko , yell if you can hear me ! JACK : Toshiko ! Toshiko ! ( PANTING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( KEYBOARD CLICKING ) Never thought I 'd say this to anyone here , but you work too hard . Another hour and I 'm done . I wish the rest of them thought like you . At 5 : 30 , they 're out of here like a pack of dogs . - You have a good evening , sir . - I doubt it . Another late one , Miss Sato ? You know me , George , married to the job . When are you going to let me whisk you away from all this ? As soon as you clear it with your wife and grandchildren . - Always an excuse . Take care . - Good night , George . - I 've got it . - Get in . ( BEEPING ) I want to see my mother . I want to know she 's safe . Now . Show me the piece . It 's beautiful . A perfect sonic modulator . - Toshiko , you 've done so well . - Toshiko ! ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) You 've got what you want . Now let her go . Well , except now , you 're the victim of your own success . Perfectly situated , proven ability . You can give us so much more . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) - And what if I refuse ? - Then your mother stays with us . And your brilliance is used against her . - Like this . - No . Don 't ... ( SCREAMING ) SOLDIER 1 : Turn it off ! Turn it off ! SOLDIER 2 : Get down ! TOSHIKO : My mother ! Is she all right ? Is she all right ? WOMAN ON SPEAKER : This is a UNIT facility . Your rights as a citizen have been withdrawn . You 'll be held here indefinitely . We are not required to provide you with legal representation . Anything you say will be recorded . You will be allowed no communication with any person or organisation outside this facility . There is no right of appeal . If you fail to comply with the rules , we are authorised to discipline you . Is my mother safe ? We cannot supply you with that information . Prisoner Sato , inspection . What for ? Prepare for inspection . ( DOOR U N LOCKING ) JACK : Catering 's as lousy as they say , huh ? - TOSHIKO : Where 's my mother ? - She 's safe . She won 't remember being kidnapped . I wiped it from her memory . - I hope you don 't mind . - You did what ? Really just a little pill . She 'll never have known . - Who are you ? - Nobody . I don 't exist . And for a man with my charisma , that 's quite an achievement . - Are you a lawyer ? - Do I look like a lawyer ? They 're going to make an example of you . Stealing official secrets in today 's climate , they 're going to keep you here without charge . - Forever . - They can 't do ... They 're never going to release you . I 'm sorry . You made this , right ? - I just followed the plans . - Yeah , kinda . But first , you had to grasp the concept of what a sonic modulator does . Most people would struggle with that . And another thing , - the plans don 't work . - What ? The technical plans you followed , they were wrong . They had mistakes in them . That 's why the plans were shelved . But you , Toshiko Sato , you automatically fixed things as you went along . What I 'm trying to say is , oh , baby you 're good . I mean , you 're good now , imagine what you 'd be like with a little training . Shame you 're going to be locked up for so long . - You 've got to get me out of here . - If you - come work for me . - Really ? Give me five years , I 'll get them to wipe your record clean . They owe me a few favours . - What do you do ? - Protect people . At least that 's what I 'm aiming for . It 's kind of a work in progress . - What about my mother ? - Limited contact only , you can send her postcards . So what do you say ? - Why would you trust me ? - Instinct . It 's going to be dangerous . Think you could bear a little danger ? ( SCREAMING ) GWEN : Stop , stop , stop ! Stop ! - Tosh , Tosh , you okay ? - You 're making it worse . It 's pushing down even more . I think I 've broken my arm . - Gwen ... - Yeah ? If this pillar shifts down even more , it will crush me . It 's no good , Gwen . We 're going to need more strength ... Okay , look , Jack has gone to find Owen and Ianto . You 're going to be fine , darling , all right ? You 're going to be fine . You 've got to hurry , please . - Gwen , help Jack . I 'll stay here . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . - I 'm going to come back for you . - You 're going to be okay . - TOSHIKO : Okay . Gwen , this could 've been you , couldn 't it ? If you hadn 't been late . Rhys , I haven 't got time for this now , okay ? I 've got to go and try and find the others . ( SCREAMING ) JACK : Ianto ! Ianto ! ( GROWLING ) ( JACK SCREAMING ) ( IANTO GRU NTING ) - Thanks . - No . Thank you . - And you are ? - Jones . - Ianto Jones . - N ice to meet you , Jones , Ianto Jones . Captain Jack Harkness . - Lucky escape . - I had it under control . You think so ? Looked pretty vicious . You 're , um ... - You were bleeding . - Had worse from shaving . Looked like a Weevil to me . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I 'll take him from here . - Thanks for the assistance . - Any time . By the way , love the coat . Morning . Coffee ? Wow . - I wanna work for you . - Sorry . No vacancies . - Look , let me tell you about myself . - Ianto Jones . Born August 19th , 1983 . Able student , but not exceptional . One minor conviction for shoplifting in your teens . N umber of temporary jobs , mainly a drifter , until two years ago , you joined the Torchwood Institute in London . Junior researcher . Girlfriend , Lisa Hallett . - Deceased . - Sorry . - Look , you checked me out . - You knew what a Weevil was . Thought I was going to have to come " deal with you " . But instead , you can see I have the right qualifications for the job . There is no job . We 're nothing to do with Torchwood London . I severed all links . Yet when it burnt , two members of your team scavenged the ruins . I don 't want the equipment getting into the wrong hands . And you 're the right hands , are you ? - Trial period . Three months . - No . Three weeks . Three days . Let me prove myself to you . I 'll work for nothing . No . I saw what they did at Canary Wharf . What am I supposed to do with those memories ? You are not my responsibility and we 're not hiring . Same time tomorrow , then . There is no job for you here and there never will be . I really like that coat . JACK ON RADIO : Toshiko , see if you can decode those hieroglyphics . TOSHIKO : Already on it . JACK : Owen , take a cross-section of the paramedic 's brain . Check it against the list of chemical agents . OWEN : Will do . JACK : Suzie , we 're going to need to dredge the reservoir . See if you can find the other half ... Oh . - Okay , this has to stop . - No . Listen to me . I don 't have time for this . Look , I don 't care what your problem is . I want you out of this city by sunrise . There is no place for you here . Go back to London , find yourself another life . Keep stalking me , I 'll wipe your memory . - No , but the thing is ... - Look , any conversation between us , no matter what the subject , is over . Finished . Done . Forever . I 'm getting back behind the wheel of that car , if you 're still standing in the road , I 'm gonna drive through you . So you 're not going to help me catch this pterodactyl , then ? Okay , that is the only special equipment you 've got ? Yeah . ' Cause I keep dinosaur nuts in the back of the SUV . Torchwood London would 've ... ( PTERODACTYL SQUAWKING ) Nope . - How did you find it ? - Rift Activity Locator . - Torchwood London . - See , quality kit . - Yeah , it 's quite excitable . - Must be the aftershave . - Never wear any . - You smell like that naturally ? 5 1 st century pheromones . People have no idea . - Ready for another go ? - I 'm game if you are . Three , two , one . ( PTERODACTYL SQUAWKING ) Shh . Shh . Shh . ( JACK CH UCKLING ) We 're not going to harm you . You can 't stay here . Come back with me . I 've got somewhere nice and big where you can fly around . Okay , so you let the pterodactyl in but not me ? - I need a guard dog . - I could be that . A receptionist ? Building maintenance ? Food and drink ? Dry cleaning even ? That coat of yours must take a battering . - Like a butler , I could be a butler . - We don 't need a butler . Excuse me . Dried egg on your collar . - It was a busy week . - What exactly is your plan ? - I 'm gonna be the decoy . - And it won 't rip you to shreds ? Dinosaurs ? Had them for breakfast . Had to . Only source of food protein after the asteroid crashed . Long story . Here you go . One injection to the central nervous cortex . I 'll keep it occupied . Move . - No . - What ? It knows me . I 'll be a better decoy . - Way too dangerous . - No , I 've got a secret weapon . Chocolate . Preferably dark . ( WHISTLING ) Got your favourite . Yeah . ( PTERODACTYL SCREECHING ) It 's good for your serotonin levels , if you 've got serotonin levels . Whoa ! Whoa ! Ianto ! ( JACK GRU NTING ) Sorry . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) I should go . Hey ! Report for work first thing tomorrow . Like the suit by the way . ( JACK GRU NTING ) JACK : Ready ? Three . One , two , three . Come on . Oh , my God . Come on . Come on , come on . ( IANTO SCREAMING ) - You okay ? - My shoulder . I think it 's dislocated . - Can you take this ? - Yeah . Take a deep breath . - Where are the others ? - We need your help to get Toshiko out . - Owen ? - No sign yet . If anything happens , he can 't repair himself . - Of course , he can 't heal , can he ? - Okay , we 'll help Rhys with Toshiko . Let us know when you find Owen , and be careful . Okay . Okay ? You all right ? ( CREAKING ) Oh , go on . Please , please , please , please . No . You don 't even like her , ever since she didn 't pay for her share of the Chinese in Leicester . Yeah , but we want Julia to come and it 'd look odd if we invite one without the other . Oh , God , help me please . Help me , God . Three tables done . N ine more to go . You wanna back out ? It 's still not too late . Listen , I 'm marrying you even if it kills me , okay ? H mm . Good . You want a cup of tea ? - Yeah , I 'll make one . - Think I can manage . - Katie ? - Yeah ? Erm ... Water . Yeah . From the kettle . ( KATIE SIGHING ) Milk . Stop nagging me . I don 't want to have milk . I 've never liked milk . I want to have ... - Tea . - I wanna have tea without ... ( SIGHING ) - Milk . - Tea without milk . ( BANGING ) ( KATIE CRYING ) It 's all right . It 's all right . MAN : I got your invitation . It 's still going ahead ? - I promised her a summer wedding . - Before all this . - This changes nothing . - Owen , it will change everything . - You don 't know for certain . - We 've been through Kate 's test results more times than any patient in my whole career . You 've looked through them yourself . All the evidence suggests she has early onset Alzheimer 's . - The youngest case in medical history . - Doesn 't mean we 're wrong . OWEN : Please . Run more tests . Let 's just try one more MRI scan . - An MRI isn 't gonna make any difference . - You don 't know that now . You have said yourself that this is unlike any case that you 've seen . - Maybe you 've missed something . - Owen . You don 't understand , Jim , okay ? One day she 's fine , she has perfect memory , the old Katie , and the next , there 's nothing . She 's blank . Now I am losing her and I don 't know what to do about that , okay ? So please ... What 's the point of me doing this job if I can 't help my own fiancée ? - I 'll see what I can do . - Thank you , Jim . It 's like being lost in a place you know really well , you can 't get your bearings . Sometimes it comes back to you and sometimes ... I 'm sorry , Owen . What 've you got to be sorry for ? I don 't want to put you through this . Last night , I dreamt that you left me . Come on . Nobody 's leaving anyone . ( KATIE SNIFFLING ) How is that possible ? We don 't know . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's not the brain deteriorating , it 's a clear physical tumour . - That wasn 't there last week ? - Not that we saw . - You were right to ask for another scan . - So , what do we do now ? We have to view this as good news . Katie , we need to take you into surgery soon as possible and remove the tumour . You understand ? Katie ? I can 't remember your name . You sure she 's up to this ? We 're going to do everything we can for her . - I 'm sorry . - Who the hell are you ? I tried to tell them you should prepare for the worst . No , you can 't go in there . Oh , my God . Katie . - What is it ? - I 'm sorry , I tried to stop them . She 's dead . That thing in her head is an alien life form . It incubates in the brain , disrupting the shape and functions . When it 's attacked or threatened , it emits a toxic gas that 's fatal to humans . - It clears pretty quickly . - She can 't be dead . She can 't be dead . I 'm calling the police . Tell them that Torchwood 's already here and dealing with it . That 'll save them a call-out . I need to take her brain back with me . Don 't touch her . Don 't touch her . - How are you feeling ? - Where is she ? - Where is who ? - Katie . Katie Russell . She 's a junior doctor . She works here and we 're about to get married . - Let 's get you back into bed . - Get off me ! Where is she ? ( SHOUTING ) Where is she ? Where is she ? He was wearing a military uniform . He has an American accent . I promise , we have checked all the security footage . There was no such man . Jim Garrett was poisoned by some alien toxin . Jim Garrett was in a car accident . The American said that he wanted her brain and there was ... There was an alien creature or ... This happened , okay ? This is not some trauma or delayed grief or whatever you 're scribbling down . Katie 's tumour was inoperable . There was nothing anyone could have done . This is just ... This is wrong . I 'm giving you three months prescribed rest . - Don 't come into work . - Yeah . This isn 't right . He was there . It wasn 't just me . He was there , too . That is not what happened . That 's not what happened . You ! You could have saved her ! You could have saved her ! You could have ... You could have saved her . I couldn 't . I really couldn 't . ( OWEN CRYING ) OWEN : You 're not a figment of my imagination and I don 't know what 's happening any more . Maybe this is what a mental breakdown feels like . JACK : You 're fine . It 's the rest of the world that 's delusional . Why her ? There is no reason . Your life doesn 't end with her . What are you going to do now ? Go back to work ? See echoes of her in every corridor ? You need a purpose . I 'm building something . - I need a medic . - You want me ? You made them take more scans , kept trying to track me down . You don 't give up easily . I need someone like that to work with me in Cardiff . - To fight aliens ? - Exactly . Look , I ... I don 't know what happened to Katie . And I don 't know who you really are . - But there is no such thing as aliens . - You think ? I 'm having a breakdown , a mental collapse . Owen . Why did you become a doctor ? I thought if I could save one life , mine would be worthwhile . But you save one , and there 's another and another clawing at you , demanding to be saved . And even if you do succeed , you can never save enough . Maybe here you can . - Heavens . - H i . Careful ! - If that falls ... - Okay , softly . ( BOTH SCREAM ) - Okay . - Just be very careful . Okay , all right . I 'm gonna get you out . This one . Okay . - You have do it very , very gently . - Okay . There 's no way this is gonna drop on you . Whoa ! - Quiet . - Okay . Okay , silent . I 'm going to do this as quickly as possible . Listen to me , I 'm going to get you out of this . Look at me . Trust me . - Okay , Owen , hold my hand . - Slowly . Hold my hands . JACK : You okay ? OWEN : Yeah . You all right ? Tosh , what happened ? TOSHIKO : Broken arm . Bruised ribs . About an inch away from being crushed by a girder . OWEN : We were lucky . IANTO : We all were . - Jack , who 's done this ? - I don 't ... RHYS : Where 's the SUV ? ( BEEPING ) - Oh , no . - Jack , what does he want ? Oh , déjà vu . Or did I say that already ? Hey , team ! Of course , there might be a few less of you by now . Don 't know if you liked my little gift . Of course , you can 't die . And with all that life , all that time , you can 't spare any for me . Oh ! Say hi to the family . No way . It can 't be . Been a while since you 've seen your brother , eh , Jack ? Gray ? Okay , here is what 's going to happen . Everything you love , everything you treasure , will die . I 'm going to tear your world apart , Captain Jack Harkness . Piece by piece . Starting now . Maybe now you 'll want to spend some time with me . This was a targeted attack . He killed the four most senior officers . If it gets out what happened here , there 'll be a city-wide panic . Let 's go get ourselves a good view . What have you done ? We 're going to put this city back together . We 're going to find Jack . And we 're going to punish John . He 's completely crippled us , Gwen . You 're no fun . Owen , get out of there . What have you done with my brother ? This is going to get nasty . What if this is how it all ends ?

I 'm here to arrest you for felony hit-and-run . - Could I call my lawyer ? - No . I 'm pretty sure you can 't do that . Dan , where have you been ? Am I under arrest or not ? I was told to bring you in for questioning . Katie did a story on how you ask " questions " at this precinct and believe me , I need a lawyer . You don 't need a lawyer because I 'm not going to charge you . No one saw you flee the scene , in fact , one witness says no one was even driving . So short of nailing you for not setting the parking brake , I got nothing . Sit down . So why don 't you tell me what the hell 's going on and we can all go home ? I wish I knew . Katie says you disappeared for a couple days and didn 't know it . Something like that . And you went back in time ? just these dreams I 've been having , but I 'm glad you two are talking again . She came to me , dan . Hey , this may work out great for you . I wouldn 't do that to a brother . You only have yourself to blame . Can I go now ? Sure , dan . But , uh ... tell your wife I tried to listen . I saw livia . On this ... on this last trip ... or whatever . Okay . I wanted to tell her not to get on that plane , but I didn 'T . I said something about her life that hadn 't happened yet ... . I spooked her . I might have blown my chance of her liking me before we even met . Anyway , forget it .

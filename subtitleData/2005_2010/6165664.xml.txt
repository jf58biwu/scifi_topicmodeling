Mr. Sulu , set a parabolic course that will keep us from entering the Neutral Zone . Sir , a straight line will also work . Para ... bolic ... , Mr. Sulu . Wait ... Elliptical . Aye , Captain . Captain , I 'm getting something on the distress channel . Minimal signal ... Something . Can you amplify . I 'm trying . Elliptical course , laid in . Sounds like vitals . Very faint . On the main screen . On screen . Very interesting . Looks like an old Federation-type vessel . Agreed , Captain . Mid-twenty first century . The vessel identified , Captain . It 's the vessel , Botany Bay . Initiate contact . Signal sent . No response . Gentlemen , who 's in the mood for a little history lesson ? Space ... . the ultimate frontier .

One female alien ... . ... make that two females . One male human ... . I 'm afraid this one didn 't make it . Captain , vital signs on this one very low . We need to take him to sick bay immediately . OK , Bones . Scottie , 3 to beam to sick bay immediately . Spock ! Captain ? Need to initiate simulation protocol with two female aliens . [ transporter sounds ] [ whoosh ] Looking for love , Vulcan ? I 'm afraid the question provides it 's own answer . Love ? ... . ... is an illogical emotion that Vulcans most certainly do not seek . But lust is universal . I was dipped in Venus fluid moments after my birth . Well , my purpose in life is to please men . That I do not question . However I can assure you ... I am quite immune ... . ... to the temptations of the flesh . Well let 's see if you 're immune to this . Fascinating ! Interesting ! So how does that feel , Vulcan ? Hmm ... . fascinating ! You feeling any of that lust ? You have the greatest cock for a Vulcan , I 've ever had ! You can 't tell me that doesn 't feel good , Vulcan . I 'm the most popular female alien in my fleet . I know you enjoy that . How does that hot mouth feel ? Does it feel good ? Makes you feel like you wanna cum down the back of my throat . Don 't feel up my mouth and belly with your hot spunk . Very interesting ... Anything yet ? By Captain 's orders we are to seek and ... This pussy ... . this pussy ... . It 's been so many years since I 've had ... cock ! See if you can resist lust . Oh , I wanna suck your cock . I wanna suck your cock ! Put it back in . Give me it . Yes , give me that big dick . Oh , let me torture that dick with my pussy . Let me torture it . My pussy plays tricks on your cock . Is it too good ? Make those muscles squeeze around your dick like that . I wanna hear your balls smacking on my ass . Slide it right in .

Give all that cum for me . Oh , yes , feed me that cum . Let me taste every drop of it . You wanna give me a mouthful of that spunk ? Let me taste every drop of it . Let me taste every drop of it . I wanna taste every drop of it . Where am I ? You ... are aboard ... USS Enterprise . What kind of ship is this Enterprise ? I have no knowledge of such a vessel . You ... have been suspended for 200 years . This is the 23rd Century . I must apologize . I am Kahn . Commander of the SS Botany Bay . May I see your first officer . Of course . Captain Kirk will be with you shortly . Leutinent McGivers . Your expertise as ship historian is required . Required ? Or requested ? Required . And then later we can discuss special requests . We have recovered a human from the 21st century . I want you to ... make him feel at home . Talk to him . You mean interrogate him ? Exactly . Meet me on deck 4 . Kirk out . Spock . Captain . I need you and the two aliens aboard the ship immediately . I 'm afraid only one of them is ready to beam up . I 'm still in the middle of extracting dilithium ... It hasn 't been easy . Spock out . Commander Kahn , I am James Tiberius Kirk , captain of the Enterprise . Captain of the Enterprise . It is an honor to have you aboard as my guest . Captain the honor is mine , I assure you . I was very fortunate to be in proximity to your ship . When my capsule malfunctioned . I owe you my life . Don 't mention it . This is Leutinent Marla McGivers , ship historian . She would like to spend some time with you ... to help you fill in the blanks , if you don 't mind . I 'm sure you have a lot of unanswered questions . It is a pleasure , Lieutenant . I 'd be delighted to . ... Fill you in . Please excuse me . I need to find more appropriate clothes . Am I gonna see you later . Or are you gonna keep ignoring me ? Ignore you ? Impossible ! You are ... Commander Kahn ! I would be greatly honored if you would join me for dinner . Your hospitality is greatly appreciated , Captain . Yes . Please sit . So ... I 'd like to gather some information about your ship . ... It 's mission ... and then ... . Why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion ? It 's regulation . Regulation 's such a an ugly word . Soft ... naturally . Simple . Commander Kahn , please . I 'm here on business . So am I. I am Captain James T. Kirk and you are aboard the Enterprise . Where 's Kahn ? Commander Kahn , is resting in guest quarters . We made provisions for your accommodations as well . No ! You must be warned ! Warned about what ? I can 't speak freely here . Women just don 't like to give straight answers do they ? The ... . It 's here ! How long have I been suspended for ? We estimate approximately 200 years . I have information about your guest of honor ... .. Kahn . He 's not who he appears to be . I don 't understand . I need you now ! You 're quite emotional for a Vulcan . I have blood fever . On Vulcan we call it ... Ban Far ... Precisely ! I thought blood fever was exclusive to Vulcan males . Strain B17 also affects some females . Some females ? Somehow that seems quite ... . illogical . Just fuck me . Yeah , those beautiful Vulcan eyes . Taste your fucking slutty pussy ! Stretch open that pussy . Tell me more about Kahn . I ... must ... seize ... control of this ship . What ? You heard me . This galaxy needs leadership . I will provide it ! Please don 't . Go ! Or stay . But do so because it is what you wish to do ! I 'll stay ... for just a little while . This act grows tiresome ! Now you must ask to stay ! I 'd like to stay . Please ? Open your heart ! Will you open your heart ? ! Yes ! Yes . I need your help to take control of this ship ! Will you help me ? ! Will you harm anyone ? How dare you question me ? ! Will you assist me ? ! Please ... don 't ask ... . Go I say ! Leave me then ! No . I 'll help . I promise . Very well . This is the PSI 2000 virus . You will help me get it into the ship 's ventilation system . You will start with the sick bay . With Dr. McCoy out of the way , they will have now way to stop the virus ! Is it deadly ? Only if they don 't relinquish control of the ship . [ coughs ] Doctor ! [ coughs ] Doctor ! [ coughing ] Ms ... .. What 's wrong ? ! [ coughing continues ] My god ... your pupils ! You have PSI 2000 poisoning ! The virus was eradicated centuries ago . Wait ... I remember a sudden release of endorphins ... should stimulate the production of antibodies that kill the virus . Christine this may sound strange ... but I need you to start to ... you know ? Have an orgasm ? ... to ... you know ? Yes ! That 's it ! ... to ... you know ? Yes ! That 's it ! Exactly ! I 'm sorry but it 's the only way . If the orgasm is powerful ... it should release enough endorphins to do the trick . Here . A massager ! For gods sake use it ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh . Yes , that 's it ! Keep going . That 's it . Mmmm ... . Yes , Christine . The virus worked . Sick bay is completely infected . Very well . You are a precious ally . soon to be a queen . Oh , Kahn ... . Now ... I must deal the final death blow ! My god it worked . Oh my god , doctor your eyes ! Eyes ! There 's no time to waste ! What is that ? So you were unable to get any information from the ship 's onboard computers . [ Enterprise hailing sounds ] Go ahead Bones . Jim ! Someone just sabotaged the sick bay ! Potentially deadly virus ! PSI 2000 . PSI 2000 . I remember reading about it in the history ... . Wasn 't there some sort of antidote ... . ? Can I help you ? I do believe so . Mr. Spock ... Our guests tonight need to beam back to the ship . There 's several items of historical significance aboard . Well , I 'm sorry , but you know I only take orders from the Captain . You 'll take orders from me for now on . Excellent ! Now we can spread the virus through the entire ship ! Activate it ! [ transporter sounds ] Greetings Captain . The Enterprise is now contaminated with the PSI 2000 virus . Surrender and relinquish control of the ship to me . You will have the antidote . This is my only offer . You have but a few moments to survive . Thank you , Kahn . I will consider your offer . Consider nothing ! I can just as easily pilot a ship full of corpses ! Now , you 're a dead man Kirk . I will put ... . Who is this peasant who dares to challenge Kahn 's authority ? ! Either way , in 15 minutes this ship will be mine for the taking ! Kahn ! Captain ! What are we gonna do ? You 're just gonna have to trust me . Spock ! Captain ! Are you sure you Leutinent Uhura was infected ? Why do you ask ? Her eyes ... they never actually changed color . As I recall the virus is only visible to people with blue eyes . Hmm ... I 've never actually heard of that . In fact , I myself never actually felt anything before or after the ... sexual encounter . Don 't worry Spock . I won 't tell anyone . Your game is over , Kahn ! Give yourself up ! This is impossible ! How is it your still alive ? ! Simple ... You 're a delusional sociopath , therefore very predictable . We 'll see about that , Captain ! Would you look at that ? ! It 's only set to stun ! For now ! Beam me to my ship or I 'll slit her throat ! Bye for now , Kirk . Don 't worry . Our paths will cross again I 'm sure . Late to the party , Mr. Scott ! [ transporter sounds ] I , uh ... I can assure you a Scot 's never late to a party . Kahnnnnn ! Mr. Sulu , we have some baggage to unload . Set a course for the nearest Federation detention center . Elliptical course Captain ? Surprise me . I 'm sorry ... . Jim . I 'm sorry too , Bones . I 'm sorry there 's only room in my life for one woman ... . ... and her name is . Enterprise ... .. there is one thing that still puzzles me , doctor . Only one thing ? Mr. Spock isn 't sick bay sufficiently equipped with ... endorphin hypersprays ? Second star to the right . Yes , Mr. Sulu . Straight ahead till morning .

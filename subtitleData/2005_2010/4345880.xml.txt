 ( GRUNTS ) ( YELPS ) ( YELPS ) All right , get out of the way . Get out of the way ! Come here ! Come here ! ( PEOPLE GRUNTING ) Move , move ! Come on , come on , come on , come on ! This is Scott . Slow down the evac ! We are coming in too hot ! Colonel , come in ! MAN 1 : Move it back ! MAN 2 : Oh , my God , where are we ? WOMAN 1 : What is this place ? SCOTT : Move away from the gate ! ( GROANING ) - Where are we ? - MAN 3 : Where is this ? Why didn 't we come through to Earth ? There 's no time to explain . Off to the side ! WOMAN 2 : What 's going on ? SCOTT : All right . Come on , come on , come on . ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) This is Scott . Come in ! Colonel , come in ! - I need a medic ! - Over here ! JOHANSEN : Can you move your fingers ? VOLKER : No . I think my arm 's broken . Okay , just hold your arm there and we 'll put it in a sling , okay ? ( SHOUTING CONTINUES ) ( YELLS ) ( PANTING ) ( ECHOING ) Keep calm . Keep coming . ( GRUNTING ) Clear this area . There could still be more incoming . ( GRUNTS ) ( ARMSTRONG COUGHING ) - Are you okay ? - Yeah . We 've got to move . Move ! Where the hell are we ? - Greer ? Where 's Colonel Young ? - He was right behind me . ( GRUNTS ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) - Move . Move . Move . - SCOTT : Quiet ! - GREER : Stay calm ! - Move . Excuse me . GREER : Keep it down ! Move . Move . Move . Move . Move . Colonel ? Colonel ? Don 't move . ( PANTING ) Where are ... Where are we ? I don 't know , sir . Are you ... You 're in charge , okay ? You 're ... Sir ? ( GASPS ) - T.J. ! - JOHANSEN : I 'm coming ! GREER : Move back , people ! Coming through ! JOHANSEN : Let 's go ! Move , move , move ! GREER : Get back , people . - is he okay ? - I don 't know . WRAY : Get back ! Wallace ! What is this place ? - Look , I just did what Rush told me ... - Where is he ? I don 't know . He went through ahead of me . Rush ! Rush ! Eli , help me find him . What , I ... ( ENGINE WHIRRING ) MAN 5 : What 's that ? What in the hell was that ? I don 't know . Look , Sergeant , I need you to get these people settled . And you find out who and what we 've got . Nobody leaves this room . Yes , sir . Eli ! Now ! ( TYPING ) ELI : The core of the planet is the power source . You have to channel it into the weapon to destroy the enemy ship . - MAN : Can 't do it , dude . - Uh , doing it . It 's one of those programmer 's jokes , a problem that can 't be solved . - Already solved it . - No , you didn 't . Just shut up ! Watch this . - What the hell ! - What happened ? Nothing happened . I 'm back at the beginning of the level . - You 're so full of yourself . - No . No , no , no . It worked . - The firing code locked in . - Whatever . That was extremely unsatisfying . Eli Wallace ? Actually , Eli 's not here right now . Okay , okay . Whatever you guys think that I did , I swear you got the wrong guy . Do I look like someone who 'd be standing here if I didn 't already know everything there is to know about you ? - Yeah , not really . - Right . ELI : Who are you ? Dr. Nicholas Rush . May we come in ? Why ? You just spent a great deal of time recently playing an online fantasy game called Prometheus . ( LAUGHS ) Big Brother 's got nothing better to do ? Last night you solved the Dakara weapons puzzle . Yeah , a month of my life went into that . You know what happens when you solve that thing ? Nothing . We 're here . That happened . To complete that particular puzzle , you had to solve a millennia-old mathematical proof , written in another language . For that , you 've won something of a prize . Well , whatever it is , I 'll take the cash equivalent . There isn 't one . It 's a non-disclosure agreement . Non-disclosure ? So , you guys really embedded a top-secret problem into a game , hoping someone like me would solve it ? Yup . So , what do you need me for now ? I assure you , it 'll be worth your while to sign it . And if I don 't ? We 'll beam you up to our spaceship . ( LAUGHS ) Right . I think I want my lawyer to look it over first . And by " lawyer , " I assume you mean " mother . " So , we 'll just agree then that I will call you . ( WHOOSHING ) ( GASPS ) What the ... Welcome aboard the Hammond , Eli . Yes , that is planet Earth , and yes , you are on a spaceship . We need your help , Eli . To be honest , I don 't know how long it 's going to take . I should call my mom to tell her where I am . That 's probably not going to work up here . ( CHUCKLES ) Right . You can speak to her on the way . There 's a cover story you 'll have to follow . I 'm sorry . On the way to ? To another planet , 21 light years from here . ( STAMMERING ) I can 't go . I have things that ... We know about your mother 's condition . You just know everything , don 't you ? We also know that you are currently unemployed , and that your mother 's medical coverage is an ongoing issue . We 'll see she gets the best available care while you 're gone . And if I don 't sign , what ? You going to erase my memory ? ( CHUCKLES ) Something like that . Can I get some pants ? Hello , I 'm Dr. Daniel Jackson , and behind me is a stargate . It was originally built millennia ago by an alien race who we call the Ancients . Over the next few hours , we ' II be touching on some of the things ... There are 39 symbols representing star constellations as seen from Earth ... When a connection is made between two stargates , an unstable energy vortex emerges from the gate ... Whoa ! ... and settles into the event horizon , or " puddle , " as we like to call it . Later , it was discovered that using an eighth symbol would actually dial another galaxy in hundreds of thousands of light years via an interstellar wormhole . It is believed an unprecedented amount of power is required to reach the near-mythical ninth chevron . The first six symbols ... to reach the near-mythical ninth chevron . The first six symbols ... Icarus Base was established on a planet discovered two years ago to have a uniquely powerful core . The entire purpose of the project is to hopefully one day dial the nine chevron address found in the Ancient database . Hi ! I 'm Dr. Daniel Jackson . Now , you ' ve heard the term " hyperspace " for years ... - Where are you ? - ELI : It 's top secret . - Eli ! - I 'm serious , Ma . I can 't say anything more than that . But I don 't understand . Why could you not at least tell me you were leaving ? I 'm sorry , but did you get the letter from ... Yeah , the Air Force . I got it . Are you in a plane now ? You sound like you 're in an airplane . Uh , no . It 's nothing like that . I want you to know that they 're going to look after you . Well , you didn 't have to do this . This is good . Really . It 's the kind of thing I always dreamed of . - Hi . - You mind ? - No , go ahead . - Thank you . First time on a spaceship , too ? Me ? I 've been on lots of various ... - Eli Wallace . - I know . - You 've heard of me ? - I have . Wow , that almost never happens . And you are ? Chloe . I work for Alan Armstrong . Senator of California ? Oh , yeah , yeah . I have heard of California . ( CHUCKLES ) My last job was in the burger and fries field . How 'd you line that up ? I was a political science major at Harvard , so ... Mmm . I hear it 's a good school . For a while there I was at ... MIT . I know . Really ? What else have they told you about me ? - What ? - I 've seen this writing before . - in the game ? - Yeah . ( WHIRRING ) Sheesh . We 're on a ship ? RUSH : The design is clearly Ancient , in the truest sense of the word . Launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Dr. Rush ? Faster than light , yet not through hyperspace . - What are you doing ? - Who knows how far it 's traveled . Dr. Rush , I 've got a lot of wounded . We need to get home . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( MECHANICAL WHIRRING ) JOHANSEN ON RADIO : Lieutenant Scott , come in . Go ahead . We 've got a problem . One of the air vents just shut down in here . Copy that . Yeah , the air 's getting pretty thin in here , too . - What does that mean ? - That the life support system is failing . And we should probably do something about that . EMILY : Well , it 's always just one more year . It 's a command . - Where ? - It 's a lot safer than other places I 've been . - You 've put your time in , Everett . - When this tour is over , I promise ... ( ECHOING ) You know what ? Never mind . Don 't bother . You always end up choosing somewhere other than here . ( ECHOING ) I am not choosing my job over you . How you can even say ... How you can even say that to me ? I love you , but I can 't wait anymore . I can 't wait anymore . Everett ? Are you okay ? Sweetheart , baby , look at me . ( INAUDIBLE ) Colonel ? Colonel ? ( GRUNTING ) Oh , my God . Can 't you do something ? He 's having a seizure . There 's nothing I can do . ( BOTH MOANING ) ON RADIO : Scott , this is Colonel Young . Come in , please . Our guests have arrived a few minutes early , Lieutenant . What 's your position ? Com e on . Not yet . Not yet . Lieutenant , drop whatever you ' re doing and get your ass up here . I 'm on my way , sir . Bye . Holy ... Senator , it is my honor to welcome you to Icarus Base . Colonel . This is my executive assistant , Chloe . - It 's a pleasure to meet you , sir . - The pleasure 's mine . She 's also my daughter . - You must be the ... - Contest winner , yeah . That is a big gun . Rail gun . 500 rounds per minute . This is Lieutenant Scott . He 's been assigned to you , Mr. Wallace . Shall we go inside ? ELI : Unbelievable . SCOTT : Yeah , it is . It 's weird how fast you can start to take something like this for granted . So , if a stargate can instantly transport you to another planet , why did we fly here on a spaceship ? Something to do with how this one 's tied into the planet for power . Apparently , it 's been modified to only dial out because incoming wormholes are too dangerous . You 're the genius . You can probably tell me better . ( LAUGHS ) All I did was solve a puzzle in a video game . Hey , you figured out something Dr. Rush has been trying to figure out for months , which , by the way , a lot of people were glad to see . RUSH : And , of course , you know Colonel Telford . - Ready for this , Colonel ? - You just give the word , sir . Oh , I gave it quite a while ago , Colonel . I 'm just here to see how my $ 1.6 billion is being spent . ( RUSH LAUGHS ) Very good . Thank you , everyone . Dismissed . As you know , up until now , we have been unable to channel the precise amount of power necessary to unlock the stargate 's ninth and final chevron . However , thanks to some ingenuity from young Mr. Wallace here , that problem has finally been solved . YOUNG : We 've heard that before . This time we 're sure . That 's what I figured out ? I embedded the mathematical problem we had to solve into the game . I then engineered your solution into a practical , workable application . - What say we get on with it ? - Absolutely . Sergeant Riley . - RILEY : Chevron one encoded . - Sir . ( DIALING GATE ) We 're dialing now ? - A test , to see if we can make a connection . - RILEY : Chevron one locked . If we do , we will send an automated reconnaissance drone through . We 'll see what 's on the other side . RILEY : Chevron two locked . And then they 'll go ? No , first , we close down again , assess the data we receive , - and then perhaps send the away team . - lf it works . RILEY : Chevron four locked . Until then , they 're just interested observers , like us . RILEY : Chevron five locked . Chevron six encoded . Chevron six locked . Chevron seven encoded . Chevron seven locked . Chevron eight encoded . Chevron eight locked . Chevron nine encoded . - Whoa , what 's going on ? - I don 't know . We never got this far before . Chevron nine ... Chevron nine will not lock . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) We matched the power requirements down to the EMU . It must work . Power levels in the gate capacitors are going into the red . - Shut it down . - No , wait , wait , wait . RILEY : We 're reading fluctuations in the output from the core ... Shut it down now . ( GATE POWERING DOWN ) ( EXHALES ) - It should have worked . - Well , it didn 't . And drawing power from the planet 's core ... Dangerous ? Yes . We 're all aware of that ... Regardless of what 's been spent or what 's at stake , my first priority is to ensure the safety of the people on this base . Of course . Of course . Eli , we 'd best run through your equations again . If you 'll excuse me . You are not seriously putting this on me ! Not my fault . ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) SCOTT : People , you have to calm down . Seriously , you have to calm down . ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) MAN : We got power ! WOMAN : Thank God ! Everybody 's attention , please . All right , please listen . Hey , listen up ! ( CHATTERING STOPS ) What is going on ? We are on an Ancient spaceship . - MAN : What ? - That 's all I 've got . Now , what that means is that ... That means you need to use the stargate to get us all back home . That is definitely on the list of things to do , sir , - but I think right now ... - You can consider that an order . We are working on it , sir . Now , I need to speak to the person responsible for this . Where is Dr. Rush ? - Just shut up for a second , will you ! - How dare you talk to ... - Dad ? Dad , please . - WOMAN : Medic ! - Water ? Water ? Quickly . Over here . - Get ... CHLOE : Sit down . ARMSTRONG : ( GRUNTING ) The pills . ( COUGHING ) Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm just trying to explain the situation . We are on a ship , but we have no idea where we are in relation to Earth . Now , with respect , sir , the reason you might be having a hard time breathing right now is because the ship 's life-support system is not functioning properly . Dr. Rush is working on that right now . ( ALL MURMURING ) Brody and Park ? - Here ! - Here . Okay , good , you two are with me . - But these consoles just came on . - No , nobody touch anything yet ! Dr. Rush needs your help . Everybody else , just stay calm , stay put . Please . MAN : " Stay put " ? Wait , what do you mean ? You 're just going like that ? There has to be a mistake in here somewhere . Seriously , who uses a whiteboard anymore ? You have computers , like , everywhere around here . The power flow was in the target range . Why wouldn 't the address connect ? Wrong address ? There is only one found in the Ancient database in Atlantis . With no other instructions ? No , but that 's not the issue . It has to be your proof . My proof works . You know how I know that it does ? Because you said so . Gentlemen . How 's it coming ? ( ELI SCOFFS ) - Whoa , whoa ! What are you doing ? - Starting from the beginning . Wait . Save ! Save ! Save ! I can 't ... Mr. Wallace , I would like you to join me for dinner in the officers ' mess . - Thank you , I 'm starving . - We 're quite close to a breakthrough , actually . I 'd like Eli to keep working . Well , we 've been here for six months . It can wait a few more hours . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . So , Colonel , you really have no idea where this ninth chevron stargate address is gonna send you ? No idea at all . Hmm . But the Ancients built the stargate with nine chevrons . It 's got to go somewhere . ( SCOFFS ) ( MARKER CLATTERING ) ( SIGHS ) YOUNG : We 've also known for some time that the only way to unlock the ninth chevron was to solve the power issues . Well , if anyone 's going to solve it , I think Eli will . Yes , that 's right . It 's true . I am Math Boy . ( PEOPLE CHUCKLING ) Dr. Rush . Dr. Rush ! ARMSTRONG : I would like to propose a toast . Oh , no , that 's really not necessary . - Not to you . - Oh . When the proposal for this project first crossed my desk , I did not want to approve it . - Oh , my God . - It seemed clear to me at the time that there were enough terrestrial matters of importance that needed that kind of money . Now , being a proud father of a beautiful young woman is one thing . Having that young woman exceed every possible expectation is quite another . ( MELANCHOLY OPERA PLAYING ON STEREO ) It was my daughter , Chloe , who reminded me that there is no greater endeavor than seeking an understanding of who we are , and the mysteries of the universe in which we all exist . - Not in those exact words . - It was also her idea to embed the Ancient proof in a medium that would give us access to brilliant young minds that we would have otherwise overlooked . And so to all the brave men and women who have volunteered ... ( EXPLOSION ) Okay , what was that ? ( RADIO CRACKLES ) This is Young . ( EXPLOSION ) YOUNG : The base is under attack . All non-combatant personnel report to your designated areas . Everyone else to your battle stations . This is not a drill . Senator , I need you and your daughter to go with Lieutenant Scott . - Eli ! You as well . - Oh , yeah . WOMAN : Hurry . SCOTT : Yeah , we 're on our way . ( SOLDIERS CLAMORING ) GREER : What 's going on in here ? The life-support system is on , but for some reason , it 's not working properly . I 'm attempting to reset it . He has no idea what he 's doing . - Step away from that thing . - ELI : That screen says that what you 're doing is gonna overload it ... - Eli , please ! - Is that what it says or not ? You only think you know what it says in this screen because I embedded a rudimentary version of the Ancient language into the game . - This is not a game . - Don 't touch it , Rush . When the oxygen aboard this ship falls below critical level , it will become increasingly difficult to concentrate . And what you 're doing could blow up the whole ship . - Are you sure , Eli ? - Back off now or I will shoot ! Lower your weapon , Sergeant ! He already screwed us once . I 'm not going to let him do it again ! I need to get through , people . Stand aside . ( ALARM BLARING ) Sergeant , we 're under attack . Don 't know who , don 't know why . Consider the charges dropped . Go take your anger out on them . Yes , sir . YOUNG ON RADIO : What do we got , Colonel , Lucian Alliance ? That would be my guess . They haven 't introduced themselves . They started shooting the minute they came out of hyperspace . Our shields are holding , but we 're not the target . What 's heading our way ? A full squadron of gliders and a troop transport . We cut them down some , but the rest will be on your doorstep in less than three minutes . - Telford , did you copy ? - Roger that . If we can get to the transport before they land their troops , we stand a chance . RUSH : I am going to press that button . It 's going to fix the life support , and then you and I , and everyone else , will be able to breathe and think much better . Don 't do it . Okay , look . Sergeant , I know we are in a tough situation here , but I am giving you an order . Lower your weapon . So ? Well , I suppose that would have been too simple . Apparently , that did nothing . This may take a little more time , T.J. Hang in there . Copy . Does Colonel Young know about this ? He knows . Two weeks ago you told me that this was the best experience of your life . - Something must have happened . - The scholarship came in . I guess I 've just been too afraid to admit what I really want . ( SCOFFS ) Wow , you didn 't tell me you had even applied . There 's nothing else going on . You know I 'd tell you . - Unless you were protecting someone else . - I 'm not . Like I said , I just hadn 't made up my mind . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) RILEY : Dr. Rush ? I 'm reading a dangerous energy spike in the core . Eli ! Eli ! I need your help . - With what ? - The ninth chevron . What ? We need to get the hell out of here . Look , it took us two years to find this site . The properties are unique . This may be our last chance . ( EXPLOSION ) If this bombardment continues , the radioactive core is going to go critical . You mean the planet ... It 's going to explode ? - Yes . - Ah ! Okay , okay , okay , okay . - lf my math works ... - We can 't assume that ... I said " if " ! Then if it works , then it 's not a power supply issue , it 's the gate address . We 've known the first eight symbols for years , the ninth has to be the point of origin . So , what if we 're not on the planet you 're supposed to be dialing from ? This is where we are . Okay , what if we are not supposed to be here ? Icarus Base , Telford . We can 't hold them back . Let 's go ! Go ! ( SOLDIERS SHOUTING ) Sergeant Riley , dial the stargate to Earth ! - SOLDIER : Incoming ! - Come on , come on . RILEY : Chevron one locked . ELI : Okay , follow me . The symbols on the stargate are constellations as seen from Earth . - That 's what you said ... - Yes , yes . Okay , so what if Earth is supposed to be the point of origin ? - RILEY : Chevron two locked . - The only viable power source was here , - light years away . - What if that doesn 't matter ? What if it 's the only combination that will work , like a code ? - RILEY : Chevron three locked . - A code ? - Yeah . - RILEY : Chevron four encoded . - Stop the dialing sequence . - RILEY : I have my orders . Get out of my way . Get out of the way ! We can 't risk dialing Earth . ARMSTRONG : Come on , let 's go . SCOTT : Go , go , keep moving . ( GASPS ) - Dad ? Dad ? Dad ! - SCOTT : Chloe ! My father ! There could still be people trapped on the other side . All right , let 's go , people . You need to move it to the Gate Room ! This is Scott . I got about a dozen or so people cut off from the Gate Room , southeast corridor . - Oh , God ! Okay . Damn it ! - YOUNG : Oh , my God ! - Is that Dr. Simms ? - Stay with me , okay ? He was helping pull people back from the surface . ( SNIFFLING ) - Simms , can you hear me ? - T.J. - T.J. - No ! Hey , Tamara . Hey , Tamara . Come on , we got to go . That is impressive . The power 's fluctuating at critical levels . Colonel , I 'm detecting a massive buildup of energy from the planet . Recall our fighters . Radio Colonel Telford . He 's got two minutes to get his people aboard before we jump to hyperspace . ( RUMBLING ) What 's everybody doing ? I ordered an evacuation . He , uh ... He didn 't dial Earth . It 's the ninth chevron address . What ? The attack started a chain reaction in the planet 's core . There 's no way of stopping that . And any blast could easily translate through an open wormhole . It 's too dangerous to dial Earth . You could have dialed somewhere else . Anywhere else . - RUSH : This could be our only chance . - Shut it down . - You can 't , it 's too late . - Riley ! - System 's not responding , sir . - I need to get these people out of here . - We have a way out . - We don 't know what 's on the other side ! - Damn it , Rush ! - Can 't be worse than here , can it ? Nobody move . Await further instructions . What 's that ? Well , it doesn 't look like life support . RUSH : Yes , I realize that . Whoa ! - What are we looking at ? - It 's a star map . PARK : That 's the Milky Way . RUSH : I believe it 's a visual log of the ship 's journey . So , this is where we are now ? No . That 's where the ship originally embarked from . ELI : Earth . - It 's leaving the galaxy . - RUSH : It did . Long ago . That was Pegasus . So , those points are more stars ? No , they 're galaxies . Rush , where the hell are we ? Several billion light years from home . - Please . - YOUNG : Scott . Stand clear . You could take down the rest of the roof with that . Look , we don 't have time to argue . I need you to lead the evacuees through the gate . You need to go with him . No ! I 'm staying here until I know my father 's okay . Make sure everyone carries as much of the expedition supplies as they can . - Why ? - ' Cause you 're not going to Earth . Rush dialed the ninth chevron . Go . Go ! ( RUMBLING CONTINUES ) Once I 'm through , follow one at a time on a three-count . SOLDIER : Okay , people . Make way . Come on , let 's go . Keep it going . You good ? Okay , let 's go . If you can hear me , stand back ! Okay , get down . Fire in the hole ! ( CHLOE EXCLAIMS ) ( CHLOE COUGHING ) Dad ? Dad ? GREER : Put your weight on me . - Put your weight on me . - YOUNG : Stay calm , everybody . - I got you . - CHLOE : Please . Okay , everybody stay calm ! Don 't push . ( YELPS ) Dad ! ( EXCLAIMS ) Careful , careful . - YOUNG : You 're okay , sir . - Are you okay ? I 'm the last one . I 'm all right . Greer , go . I 'm right behind you . Hammond , this is Young , come in . Hammond , this is Young . Come in . GREER : Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , come on , people . Let 's do it . Let 's do it . SOLDIER : Hurry up ! - Sir ! - Go ! Sir . We 've got Colonel Carter . On screen . General , we barely got away . The planet was destroyed . We managed to beam most of our people off the surface before jumping to hyperspace . We also believe that the enemy forces were destroyed . Any word on how they gained intel on our base ? No . What about casualties ? Twelve . Eighty-plus MIA . The bunker-shielding technology prevented us from beaming out anyone inside . How many people made it through the gate to Earth ? None . None ? Our sensors indicated that the stargate was active for a full six minutes before the core went critical . Well , they didn 't come through here . Then where ' d they go ? Okay , listen up ! Everybody who is able , we are going to search this ship top to bottom . Teams of three . - Weapons ? - Twenty-three , including handguns . - One per group ? - Yeah . Flashlights , radios , only when necessary . Once those batteries are dead , they are dead . Regular check-ins with Dr. Rush in the control room every 10 minutes , and keep in mind , as far as we know , this bucket is really freaking old , and there may be areas of damage where life support is unstable . And , look , be smart , okay ? Don 't touch anything that looks like it might be dangerous . How are we supposed to know what 's dangerous ? - Becker , right ? - Yes , sir . I work in the mess . - I mean , I did . - Well , don 't touch , just look . You 're ... You 're James , right ? - Yes , Lieutenant . - You and Riley are with me . Subtle , man . Subtle . SCOTT : If it 's okay with you , sir , it might be best , considering your obvious skills , for you to hang back here and help keep the rest of these people calm . Don 't patronize me , son . No , sir . - Are you all right ? - I 'm solid , Lieutenant . I 'm trained for this . - Look , I didn 't mean to ... - Look , not now . ON RADIO : Rush , this is Scott . Come in . Rush , this is Scott . Come in . Hello . This is Eli . - Where 's Rush ? - Bathroom , if he found it . I 'm at what looks like a bulkhead door . It won 't open . I was hoping Rush could open it from there . Should I find him ? No . - Here , give me a hand . - What happened to being smart ? This could be the engine room for all we know . We got to at least open a few doors . Do we ? Do we really ? ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) ELI : Hang on . No , keep doing what you 're doing . I think I found where you are . The door is flashing red . SCOTT : Can you open it from there ? Red is usually bad , isn 't it ? Maybe it means the door is stuck . Just try . Okay . You should probably step back . Whoa , whoa , whoa , not good ! Not good . More red ... Close it ! - Close it now ! - I 'm trying ! ( ALARM BEEPING ) Yeah . Okay . We established why that hatch was closed . Yeah . A lot of others are closed for the same reason . We 're only occupying a fraction of the ship right now . It just goes on forever . But if there are damaged areas of the ship that aren 't sealed , that could be our problem . Oh , hey , good timing . We just found ... Hey ... Really ? This is Dr. Rush . Meet me in the Gate Room immediately . Everyone . MAN 1 : I don 't know what 's going on . MAN 2 : It 's over there . ( ALL MURMURING ) What 's going on ? In this case are five Ancient communication stones . They work over vast distances in real time . - We can talk to the people on Earth . - Yes . MAN 1 : Great . MAN 2 : All right . RUSH : You physically take control of an individual at the other end . I brought these with us in the event we ended up somewhere out of range of normal communication . So let 's use them . MAN : Yeah . WOMAN : Yeah . I already have . ALL : What ? When ? - Are they sending help ? - No . MAN : Why ? Why are they not sending help ? The only means of dialing this gate from our galaxy was destroyed in the attack . We 're cut off . I want to use one of those stones now . - I have spoken with General O 'Neill ... - I am a United States senator ! I 've explained our situation clearly . In light of my knowledge and experience , he has placed me in charge . He did what ? ( ALL MURMURING ) MAN : How do we know ? I have faith in our ability to repair this ship and to work together , but if we 're to survive this , we need leadership and a clear chain of command . ELI : We only have a few hours of air left . - Yeah . - I want to speak to the General myself . - Senator , please . - Give it to him ! WOMAN : Yeah . SCOTT : Give it to him . ( GROANING ) - CHLOE : Dad ? Dad ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa . T.J. ? Excuse me , excuse me . Okay . Okay , he 's still breathing . CHLOE : Oh , my God ! JOHANSEN : I saw him taking some pills ? CHLOE : Warfarin , for his heart . Blood thinners are the last thing he needs if he 's bleeding internally . - Please do something ! - Look , I told you , I 'm just a medic . Everyone , please , there 's no need for us all to congregate in the one place . Ms. Johansen , please find adequate accommodation for the injured , - and everyone else ... - No , I don 't recognize your authority , - Dr . Rush . As an IOA representative ... - We have found quarters nearby - much more comfortable . Please go there ... - I think you need to and stay there until you 're asked to do something useful . Something useful ? We do not want to settle in ! - We want to get back ! Right ? - Yeah . We should be working on getting home . - WRAY : Exactly . - I 'm not sure if that 's even possible . What ? You haven 't even tried ! Maybe you should actually do something instead of standing around , - talking about being in charge . - lf that 's even true . Everybody ! Everyone , calm down ! Now , the fact is Colonel Young put me in charge , and I expect all SG personnel to follow my orders . As for the rest of you , you get out of line , we will lock you down . Now , Dr. Rush is right about a couple things . First off , we all have to work together , and second of all , we don 't all have to stay here , so let 's move out . - Go on , move . It 's okay . - SOLDIER 1 : All right . You heard him . SOLDIER 2 : Do as he says , people . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) I think we need you , so I 've got your back for now , but if I were you , I would find some way to dial that gate back to Earth . I 've got some testing equipment over here . Looks broken . - We 'll get back to that . - What about all these Ancient crates ? If it 's not ours , don 't touch it . VOLKER : Did no one think of labeling anything ? Every case has a bar code . All right , anyone find a bar code reader ? I guess that got left behind along with the food and water . - Uh-uh . We got food . - Yeah , protein bars and this powdered stuff . Look , everybody . Seeds ? Volker , you 've got to be kidding . PALMER : I got a case of blank paper . VOLKER : Maybe we should start a suggestion box . What are you staring at ? - You were in detention . - Yeah . - For good reason . - GREER : What did you want him to do ? - Leave me there ? - Of course not . I was just wondering what to do about it now . - That 's not up to you . - We 'll see . No , no , no . Don 't do it , man . SCOTT ON RADIO : Greer , I need you to check for any open bulkhead doors that lead to damaged parts of the ship . Rush will direct you . Copy . RUSH ON RADIO : There should be an elevator directly ahead . Copy that . - Are you there yet ? - This is Scott . Radio silence , please . - Hey . - Hey . What 's going on ? We almost lost you . You were thrown clear across the room . - Where are we ? - Sir ... ( GROANS ) - Where are we ? - We 're on a ship . It 's Ancient . Rush says it 's thousands of years old and we 're pretty far off into the universe . - What 's he doing to get us home ? - He says he 's working on it , but we have bigger problems . The life-support system isn 't working properly . If we can 't get it fixed , there 's not much time . You should also know that he used the communication stones to contact Earth , and he said General O 'Neill put him in charge . I don 't think so . I don 't think ... Oh ... Sir , you shouldn 't be trying to get up just yet , okay ? I don 't think I have a choice , T.J. I can 't feel my legs . - Whoa , jeez ! - ELI : Whoa ! What is that thing ? Come here , I 'll show you . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) It 's a ... It 's a camera . It 's a flying camera . I 'm calling it a Kino , you know , after the Russian ... - Yeah . - Okay . Well , I figure maybe we can use it to check out the damaged areas of the ship . - That 's good . - Yeah . - That 's good . Where 's it going now ? - Oh , I don 't know . It 's just doing its thing , but there 's lots more of them . ( ELI CHUCKLES ) - Yeah , it 's cool . - Yeah ! - Do you want one ? - It 's not a gumball machine , Eli . Okay . - Okay ! - Okay , so you figured out where they keep the Kinos . What else have you figured out ? Give me a break , man . This is my second spaceship , and my first was yesterday . I know . Icarus was my first SGC assignment after training . I haven 't been at this much longer than you have . Did they beam you out of your house ? - ( CHUCKLES ) No . You got me there . - Got any food on you ? - No . - Tylenol ? - Headache ? - Yeah . Me , too . Neuropraxia is temporary paralysis that can follow a concussive injury . You don 't know ? You 'd need an MRI and a qualified doctor who knows how to read it to know for sure if there 's spinal damage . We don 't have either . Hopefully , it 's just the nerves in shock . Best I can do is insist that you remain still . Your tour was over two weeks ago . You should be in some classroom in San Diego . Seattle . That 's where my scholarship was . - I 'm sorry . - That part 's not your fault . Tell Rush I want to see him . Yes , sir . - What 's that ? - Flying camera ball . - I 'm calling it a Kino . - Don 't ask . - That 's marvelous . - It comes with a remote . I thought we could use it to look around . - What do you have ? - Well , it 's not so good , really . These processing nodes are scrubbers , responsible for cleaning CO2 from the air . Here , here , and here , it 's indicating malfunction . Others are failing . Greer , this is Scott . I 'm heading for the Gate Room . Meet me there . Look , I 'm just saying that she better stay out of my face . I 'll remind her of your personal space issues next chance I get . Dr. Rush ? Colonel Young wants to see you right away . There should be a kind of grate covering the node . RUSH : What do you see ? SCOTT : A problem . We see a very big problem . What happened ? You collapsed . We brought you here . - What 's going on ? - I 'm not sure . I 've been here with you . I need to know what 's happening , Chloe . This is important . Dad , I was worried about you . - Okay . - And I 'm scared . One step at a time , honey . One step at a time . - My pills ... - No , Dad , you can 't take any more of those . Your ribs are badly bruised . You will bleed internally . If I don 't take those pills , a bruise is going to be the least of my problems . I know . Don 't worry about me . Go . Find out what 's going on out there . No , I want to be here with you . And I want you here , but right now , I want to know what 's going on just a little bit more . Okay . I 'll be here when you get back . - Okay . - Okay . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - What 's going on ? - I don 't know , man . The air filter 's full of crap . Come on . They want us to keep looking . - Let 's go . - All right , okay . Alkaline . Everyone 's heart rates are elevated , people are reporting headaches . - It has to be . - What ? The used-up residue of whatever magic compound the Ancients used to scrub CO2 from the air . So , now we have two big problems relating to the life support . Our first priority must be to seal off any of the leaks . If we can manage that , then we can maybe buy ourselves a day or so before the buildup of CO2 kills us . - As it stands , how much time do we have ? - I don 't know . Couple of hours at most . Huh . Awesome . Brody , there was some medical-grade soda lime in the supply manifest ? - It never made it . - That 's a pity . Well , in a ship this old there 's bound to be systems past their designed life . Okay , let 's say we find the leaks . Can you fix this ? I doubt this stuff can be cooked off . Perhaps if there were stores of this substance in a clean form , or something else capable of CO2 sequestration , calcium carbonate , lithium hydroxide , then yes , " if . " Okay , well , that 's not going to matter because you 're going to get the gate dialed back to Earth before this becomes an issue , - Rush , right ? - Lieutenant ... That 's the kind of thing you 're taught to say in officer training , presumably for the benefit of those who don 't know any better . Please . What makes you think I won 't try ? Greer , I found what looks like a shuttle . Looks like there are two shuttles , attached to individual docking sleeves . - We 're all going to die . - GREER : Shut up , Franklin . I 'm just saying what everyone 's got to be thinking . I said shut up , or else you 're going to be the first . This the door ? Yeah , yeah , that 's it . Can you close it ? It won 't close . We can 't close it from here , either . There 's something wrong with the mechanism . FRANKLIN : I think I found the leak . There 's another door on the back of the shuttle , but there 's no control . Then maybe we can close it off locally . FRANKLIN : The shield keeping the air inside is obviously not 100 % effective . RUSH : Probably wasn 't designed to compensate for the amount of damage the ship has sustained . FRANKLIN : Is there a way of boosting it ? At least in the areas we need it ? RUSH : We haven 't found a way yet . It seems to be operating at maximum capability . ( ELI GASPING ) ELI : Open the door ! Well , that 's not good . That 's very good , sir . A very good sign . I don 't have time for this , do I ? Two problems . We 're venting atmosphere from a damaged shuttle , and even if we could seal it off , the life-support system in this ship is past its expiration date . We 'll build up CO2 to lethal levels within a day . Well , that explains the headache . You already had one . They 'll find a way . That 's what these people do . Well , most of these people aren 't even supposed to be here . - How did the ship get damaged ? - We don 't know . It certainly looks like it 's been through a battle , at least the parts we can access . We 're still cut off from most of the ship . It 's huge . They tried jamming something into the shuttle doorway to keep it open long enough to let the person inside get out ... But it just opens again . Some sort of safety mechanism , like an elevator . Rush says he can 't override it . How long do we have right now ? As it stands ... Rush says if we don 't get it closed , we 've got just over an hour . Bad air 's better than no air . Guess a day 's better than an hour . Someone 's got to go in there and close this door . My head is pounding . Heartbeat has accelerated . It 's getting harder and harder to breathe , as our very lives are being vented out into space . That is going to get old very fast . - This needs to be documented . - No one 's going to see that . How do you know ? We made it here . Someone else could , too . If we die , maybe this can help them to find out what happened to us . Yeah , well , we 're not dead yet . I 'm starting to have slightly blurred ... - Eli ! - What ? So how are we going to decide who ? RUSH : I assume we 're not going to get any volunteers . What 's another day going to buy us ? Time , to find a way to survive . May I see the list ? JOHANSEN : I marked the names of anyone injured . Right . We have to find out people 's skills , background , experience ... Doesn 't take any special skills to die from asphyxiation ! Look . What I 'm saying is , it shouldn 't be someone with potentially valuable knowledge or abilities we might need to help us survive beyond this . Are you really suggesting - what I think ... - Half the people on this ship - already want to kill you . - I don 't care . You can 't ask someone to sacrifice themselves , period . Politicians ask military personnel to sacrifice themselves for the good of others all the time . If someone doesn 't go in there and close that door , we 're all going to die , period . Franklin is still working at the airlock controls locally , but it doesn 't look good , sir . Camile 's explaining the situation to everyone onboard . - I 'll do it . - Sir ? This isn 't the kind of thing I can ask somebody else to volunteer for . If we 're going to make it past this , we 're going to need you , sir . I don 't know about that . You 're doing a pretty good job without me , Lieutenant . Yeah ? Well , look at the mess we 're in . - lf that 's not proof that we need you , then ... - Look , I 'm not sure anyone should do it . I don 't want someone sacrificing themselves for me . I say we figure this out together while we still have time , - or we all die trying . - I want you to both listen to me . It needs to be done , and I 'm doing it . - Look , sir , you can barely stand . - Help me . Look , the paralysis is temporary . - Help me . - You know that now . You will recover . - Lieutenant , I need your help . - No , sir . - I gave you an order . - I know . You can have me court-martialed when we get home , but I am not going to help you kill yourself . My father 's not in his room . We 'll find him . He does not leave this room . - SCOTT : He can 't have gotten far . - I told him what was going on . Greer , this is Scott , come in . Greer ? Greer , do you read ? Senator Armstrong is missing . He may be headed your way . He 's here . He 's got a gun . I don 't want to shoot you . I don 't think you want to shoot me . - Get out of the way . - FRANKLIN : Just give me a little more time . - Let me try and fix this . - I don 't have much . ELI : Guys , I 'm not seeing any change . Whatever you just tried , it 's not working ! The problem 's obviously mechanical . You can 't fix it . Tell me what to do . Dad ! No , wait ! Dad , no ! No ! No ! No ! ( MUFFLED ) Open the door ! - Open the door , please ! - I can 't ! Please open the door ! ( CHLOE CRYING ) - He was dead on his feet . - Dad , no ! ( SOFTLY ) I love you . ( SOBBING ) Please open the door . No ! Eli ! Not him ! There 's nothing I can do for him here . Help him ! Open the door , please ! Please ! No . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! ( SOBBING ) No ! He can 't leave me . Chloe . Chloe ! Well , at least he bought us a day . ( CHLOE GRUNTS ) You ! You did this ! You killed him ! You 've killed all of us ! - Chloe , stop ! Little help here . - Hey , hey , relax . - Hey , hey , Chloe . - Just get away from me ! All of you ! Miss Armstrong . You 're in shock . Believe me , I understand . Everyone deals with tragedy in different ways . - You 're looking for someone to blame . - I 'm not looking . Hey , hey . I 'm sorry about your father . I truly am . He was a good man , and he certainly wouldn 't have been my choice , but you must realize , none of this was my fault . I didn 't create the situation that forced us here . There was no other way . ( SOBBING ) Miss Armstrong , I know you don 't want to hear this just now , but this ship ... This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the stargate itself . You know , the Icarus Project was something your father truly believed in . Enough to risk his career to support . What difference does it make if we all die ? A number of people died during the attack on the base . Some of them I knew very well . I 'm sure some had more value than others . As human beings , all of them were invaluable . Look , my point is , I promise you , I will do everything I can to make sure no one gave their life in vain . No one . Please give me a chance . Colonel . ( YOUNG SIGHS ) - We 've lost Senator Armstrong . - Oh , my God . - He 's bought us some time . - To do what ? We 're working on it . First up is trying to dial the gate back home . - Should you even be on your feet ? - No . Well , I am on my feet , and right now we 're trying to get home . Camile , I need your help . You know these people . I need you to spread the word . Try to keep things as positive as you can . - I can do that . - Good . CHLOE : I can 't believe my dad is gone . I watched him die , and I still just can 't accept it . - Tell me about him . - Why ? Man died so I could live . I 'd like to know a little more about him . No matter how tired he was , or how long he 'd worked , or what was going on in his life , he always had time to listen to me . I 'd go on and on . He never preached . He never told me what to do , even though sometimes I wished he would . He would just listen . And then he would tell me that he loved me . The best part was if I 'd had a fight with my mom , he never took sides . Hmm . Oh , God . My mom . He was her whole life . She probably thinks we 're both dead . All I know is that he wanted you to go on . I know . I got to get back to the search . You going to be okay ? I don 't know . Fair enough . - RUSH : Eli ? - What ? What are you doing ? I just watched a man die . Okay ? Don 't you even care ? Of course I do , and I 'm also trying to learn as much as I can , as quickly as I can . That is , in addition to running nine separate searches in the database in the hope of solving our life-support issues . Right . Found anything ? Destiny . As in ours ? The name of the ship . Translated from Ancient . I 've also discovered that they were never here . I thought this was an Ancient ship . It is , but they sent it out unmanned , planning to use the gate to get here when it was far enough out into the universe , but they probably learned to Ascend before that time . Learned to what ? Ascension . It 's a process whereby consciousness converts to energy that no longer requires physical form . That wasn 't in the video . Well , there 's more than one video . We should get back to work . Sorry . Sir , I think I got it . It wasn 't even that hard to find . It 's right here in the dialing program . - You 're sure ? - Yes , it 's an eight-symbol address . You mean you can dial this thing back to Earth ? There 's no point of origin indicated , but still , there 's only 36 symbols on this gate . I 'm assuming the ninth symbol represents some X-factor distance equation . Well , I don 't care . Start dialing . Sir , don 't we want to bring Dr. Rush in on this ? YOUNG : Well , you said this wasn 't that hard to find ? - No . - Well , then he probably already knows and didn 't tell us . - Oh , no , no , no , no . - What ? Someone 's dialing the gate . - Colonel Young . You 're up . - Nice to see you , too , Rush . I did order you to report to me . Yes , but what are you doing ? We 're trying to dial Earth . RUSH : That would be a mistake . YOUNG : Riley thinks he 's found the address for home . RUSH : His understanding of Ancient is marginal at best . RILEY : With respect , Doctor , I know enough to recognize a reference to Earth . He says the address wasn 't that hard to find , Rush . No , no . This is a complete waste of power we may need . We have the address back . All we need is the right point of origin . And we 've got 36 tries . We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial Earth . You see , that 's news to me . - He didn 't tell me that , either . - Well , I 've only just learned myself , - and you know what I 've been doing . - Even if it doesn 't work , the people aboard this ship need to see us at least try . So , what , you 're going to drain what little power we have for the sake of morale ? How ridiculous . ( SHIP GROANS ) What was that ? ( BEEPING ) YOUNG : Anyone near the observation deck ? Colonel , it looks like we 've dropped out of FTL . - RILEY : Because we were draining power ? - No , no . If I 'm right , the gate should begin to dial any moment . How did you know that ? The ship detected a stargate on a planet within range that may have what we need . What ? How the hell are there even stargates out here ? The Ancients sent out a number of unmanned ships ahead of this one . They 're programmed to gather data , resources , to manufacture stargates and deposit them in habitable worlds . Any relevant information is relayed back here to help plot the course . You 're telling me that this ship knows we 're in trouble ? Yes , because I told it we were . Essentially , we 're flying on autopilot . This ship may have stopped when it was within range of a stargate regardless of our need . But I have reason to believe ... YOUNG : So , what we need is on the other side of that wormhole ? An educated guess , yes . There 's only one way to find out . RILEY : Sir , you can 't do that . We have no idea what 's on the other side . We can use the Kino to find out . I expect that 's the purpose of this device . - I 'm getting readings over here . - What have we got ? Temperature , gravity , atmosphere composition , barometric pressure . Oxygen , nitrogen , very little CO2 , extremely low humidity . - Habitable , but just barely . - Good enough . BRODY : Looks like four other addresses came up here , too . They could be other planets within range . Maybe we should think about dialing them up and seeing ... No , no , no , they 're locked out . The ship chose this one . The stargate is open , all we have to do is step through . What we have to do is put a team together . Dr. Rush . RUSH : Looks like our time might be limited . YOUNG : What is it ? It 's a countdown . Just over 12 hours left . What happens then ? I suspect we jump back into FTL . Palmer is a geologist . Obviously she should go . Franklin and Brody are the best of the rest of what we have . Thanks for the ringing endorsement . He didn 't even mention me . YOUNG : Franklin goes . The others stay . We 're still going to need good people working on the problem from this end . ELI : I 'd like to go . Really ? If I can help , then ... - Colonel Young , please . - What ? You don 't think I can handle it ? He 's going . I 've been off-world before . You have made a habit out of pulling our asses out of the fire . Eli , you want to go , you 're going . The only one I 'm questioning right now is you , Dr. Rush . ( SCOFFS ) Well , besides Palmer , I 'm the only one who knows what we 're looking for . We have 12 hours to find what we need and then get back on the ship . You 're sure you can 't stop it ? No , we 're just along for the ride for now . Then we may all be better off on the planet . Well , that 's another reason why I should go . Someone to assess whether long-term survival there is even an option . Right . Okay . I want everyone clear that Scott is in charge of this mission . Let 's gear up , let 's find whatever supplies we have , and move out . - Sir , about Eli ... - He volunteered . He 's not trained for this . Just like a lot of people we got on the ship . I 'm going to need to know what they 're made of . He 'll slow us down . Well , if he does , you send him back to the gate . Listen , if we 're going to make it , and I 'm not just talking the next few hours , we 're going to need everyone on board to step up . Lieutenant . Keep an eye on Rush . We 'll be back , sir . Good luck . English - US - SDH

 Why are they after you ? Something happened to me . Listen to me ... Tell them all that I got out . Something happened to me ... I was in New York . - Go to 554 ... - 554 what ? - Tell them ... - What 's ... Where am I ! You 're not from here . I don 't even know how I got to this place . You are ... a blessing miracle ! Be seeing you . Where to ? I need to get to a railroad station . A rail what ? A train . Take me to the nearest town , if you have to . I just do local destinations , okay ? What 's the matter with you ? I need to get outta here . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Trains and railroads and ... I 'm sorry ... I 'm just trying to get my bearings here , all right ? It 's okay . Where is this place ? This ... It 's the Village . - But what village ? - What gives with you ... This is the Village and I do local destinations ? You crazy ? Can you help me ? - I need you to help me . - All right , let 's dance , first . - I don 't know how I got here . - You 've never been to Club More ... Are you okay ? What the hell is goin ' on ? Where am I ... the whole place ? You 're in the Village ... Where else would you be ? Are you sick or something ? I must be . I can 't seem to get a hold of any of this . They 're after me . - Where to now , my friend ? - Drive ... just drive ! I thought I 'd lost you . You know this job is crazy . The hours I do , man , I never see my wife , never see my kid . I have got to get outta this . You understand ? Is that your little girl ? That 's my 8-3-2 . Let me tell you , I got her this little bike , right ? I have never seen anything like it . What did you say her name was ? Name , it 's ... 8-3-2 . If I asked you to take me to 554 ... I 'd say " Now , you 're talkin ' " . She 's over there . Specials tonight are beef noodle wrap and warm feta salad wrap , and for dessert , we have my own favorite cinnamon fig and honey wrap . Do you have anything that 's not a wrap ? Why would we ? I 'll stick with a coffee for now . Thank you . Can I have one coffee , please ? I actually have a message for you , from an old man . 93 ? Is he okay ? He wanted me to tell you he got away . He said I had to find you . No , please , don 't involve me in this . Involve you in what ? Who is this guy and why was ... Why was he being chased by those ... I don 't know what they are , but they 're after me now . He was just a drunk who used to come here and talk lots of crazy talk . If he 's got himself into some kind of trouble , that 's got nothing to do with me . I have to go . - I can 't let them see me with you . - Why did he want me to find you ? He must 've had a reason ? He got away ? I didn 't believe him . I didn 't believe . Go out through the back . Please , help me get outta here ! Get up and walk . How can I get up ? How can I walk ? - How long have I been here ? - You know you are Six . Please , I 'm nobody . - I don 't know anything , please ! - But you do . You are Six . You are Village . The truth is right inside you , Six . Look ! It 's you . And I thought you just wanted to dance with me . How long have I been here ? You 've been sleeping a while . I thought I was dyin ' . Help me . What 's happening to me ? I wish you didn 't fight it . - Fight what ? - Please , let me help you . I don 't want your help , lady ... I want to get the hell outta here . Look , here 's what 's gonna happen ... I 'm gonna fetch you a cold drink And then , someone is gonna take you home . You 're a free man . I 'd like to speak to the American Council , please . Look , see how the sun makes it all glow ? Kind of day that makes you glad to be alive . Why are you keepin ' me here ? I see no locked doors . They were after me . Sounds terribly ominous . Why am I here ? It has nothing to do with me ... any of this . I 've seen you before . Really ? What were you doing in the mountains , Six ? I was ... I was ... lost . I mean , I have no idea how I got here . What did you call me ? This ... Something 's wrong here . - You are wrong , Six . - Do not call me that ... I am not Six . Show me your ID papers . I don 't have any papers ... - You just put them there . - You were seen in the mountains . What have you done with 93 ? I don 't know anything about 93 . Where is the old man ? You can 't do this to me ! I don 't care who you are . Do you hear me ! Now , I wanna get back to New York . That 's not possible ... There is no New York . There 's only the Village . Look , we 've been here before . - It all feels too familiar . - I know that . Truly , we live for today . This is my home ? - We must be doing something right . - No , I mean ... You can 't escape it . - My apartment in ... - Done in your other life . Wonkers . This is where you belong . We interrupt this programming for the following ... Will you just sign this to say that everything 's in order ? I 'm signin ' nothin ' , pal . The Palais today identified the missing villager as 93 , a man in his late 70 's , last seen heading north into the desert two nights ago . 93 is well known to hospital staff following a history of stage seven mental unwellness . He also suffers from shortness of breath , dizzy spells and a weak heart . But we wish him well and hope to report his discovery eminently . If not sooner . - What can I do you for ? - I 'd like to buy a map . - Street or topographic ? - Biggest one you got . - That 's the biggest ? - Pull her out . That 's it ! Buy one , get one free . - What would I want with two maps ? - Makes a perfect gift . Big enough for ya ? Here we are ... You are here . That 's the palais Two . " Wow " being the appropriate word . And that 's the clinic and ... - Where 's the road outta here ? - You crack me up , Six . You 've not seen me before . No , sir . You , I would remember . - But you know my ... - Welcome to the Village . Everybody knows everybody ! Be seein ' ya ! Six , wait ! - Why are you calling me that ? - Well , I think that it suits you . I like it . - Six , where do you think you 're going ? - Goin ' home . You won 't get far . Is there nothing I can say ... that will make you wait ? You can tell me the truth . What the hell is this place ? You 're one of us . That 's the truth . Man , not my car . Come on ! Do you think I could use your phone ? Mine 's just been stolen . Go ahead . Actually , I lied . I lost it . I 'm always losing my phone . I hate leaving messages , don 't you ? I noticed you , ' cause you look like you 're waiting for someone . - Maybe , I am . - Who you waitin ' for ? Don 't answer that . I 'm late ... again . Traffic is the same on the GW as the Jersey turnpike . It 's hell on four wheels out there . So , if you want my advice , get off your butt and walk ! Total gridlock after some kind of gas explosion in Brooklyn . You got my phone . I 'd say , " sorry " but I promised myself I 'd stop apologizing to men . - Having a party ? - Yeah , you wanna come ? Can 't make it tonight . There 's no party , anyway . Just what I thought ... " drinking alone " . - I 'm celebrating . - Oh , yeah ... what ? Escape . You were talking to someone . You shouldn 't listen to other people 's conversations . It 's rude . How come you 're interested in my life back there , If it doesn 't exist ? Of course , I 'm interested . I want to help you with these delusions . I can 't leave here , can I ? Why would you want to leave ? Why would you even think such a thing ? All right , Doctor . My delusion is , I met a woman the other night ... And I invited her back to my apartment . Did she come back ... To your apartment ? I don 't know . I don 't know . What 's that ? I haven 't opened it , yet . It 's from the clinic . What 's it say ? We 've been summoned ... to the clinic . What for ? An appointment , with Two . Oh , dear ! It says someone else here at the bottom . So , this guy at the hospital , he wants to know where 93 's body is . Why ? That 's not a delusion . That 's happening here , right now . If you did see 93 . Is that why they set me free , to let you loose on me ? The caring , sharing doctor , With the big beautiful eyes and the nice , girly smile . Soften me up , get me to talk ? Of course , you doubt me . You doubt everything , But that 's not you speaking , Six . That 's your condition . My condition is that I 'm being held here against my will . Cabins 29 to 63 . Yellow district , cabins 309 to 357 . Green district , apartments 51 to 299 . Can you see , Six , how I might wonder why you are here , If , as you claim , " you know nothing about 93 ? " I came here to find out who this man , 93 , is . Now that you 're here ... Do you see what he was ? A drunk . A fool . Maybe he drank , because he found the lie of this place unbearable . He knew what I know . The Village is not all that there is . What is it you 're suggesting ? A hole in the sky , aliens landing secretly in the night , A mysterious roads that lead beyond , beyond , beyond . A magic gateway , perhaps ? Some portal leading into " never-never land " . Take a look outside , Six . People going about their lives , strolling in the sun , sitting together in the park , or anywhere where they might choose to sit together . They take a scooter ride , go dancing , Enjoy a beer in the cafe , while they gaze about the Village . Contented . Hopeful . Every day above ground is a good day . The problem ... is in your mind . I want out . You 've tried that ! There is no " out " . There is only " in " . Now , you can go on tormenting yourself , If that 's what you want , Or you can stop . If 93 were no more than a drunk , a fool , as you say , Then why were they chasing after him ? Shooting at him ? Because 93 found something , And if he can do it , I can . I pity you , Six . You refuse to open your mind to the possibility that you 're wrong . If I open my mind , - You 'll take it away from me . - We might ... But we will always give it back . Did 93 show you this , I need to know . Did he talk to you about this ? Are there other drawings ? 554 , please . 93 must 've trusted you . There has to be a reason he told me to come to you . What is this , what does this do ? I 'm going to meet my boyfriend . I 'm sorry . Please , help me . Please . 93 said the drawings were from his other life ... before the Village . That 's all I know . You have to leave me alone , now . And you are here to receive a medal for services to the Village , and you should keep the medal with you , at all times . And when you met number Six , what did you make of him ? He was a little strange . - Actually - Nope . Number Six has been dealt with , so he is no longer a worry to us . And there was another thing , in the summons . It said , to bring cake , - with cherries in it . - Did you ? Leave it there . My dear villagers , perhaps Two could interrupt your day in the sun to relate the grave news that we have discovered number 93 's body in the mountains . Sadly , the old man had succumbed to a weak heart . He spoke briefly to emergency staff , before dying on route to the hospital . His last words were to honor the Village , and request the anthem be sung in his name . If you tell me what you know , I promise you , I won 't come back . Breathe in , breathe out ... Village life goes on . Do you want something to drink ? 93 was convinced that his dreams meant that he had another life , before this one . He started saying things ... That we 're prisoners here . Prisoners ? I 've said too much . I don 't even know you . It 's okay ... You can trust me . I am not one of them . I dream this , all the time . What is it ? This is more real , than anything out there . This is the first bit of hope I 've been given since I got here . If there are others like us , who dream , and they got to thinking that 93 escaped , then ... Do you think there are others ? Do you ? Are you for real ? I promise you ... You 're safe with me . I 'll see you at the cafe tomorrow . What is it , 11-12 ? Why is Six so convinced there is another place ? Because for people like Six , life is not enough . The simple life ... They want to escape it . What are you doing here ? I 'm trying to find out what you 're doin ' here . Do something for me , will ya ? Lie down beside me . You 're supposed to be trying to convince me you 're sane . Come on . Right . A hundred billion stars , over and over billions of galaxies , and that 's just what we can see . Can you honestly tell me that the Village is all that there is ? Of course not . Has to be life out there somewhere . Perhaps , another village . It 's 400 billion , by the way . Look at me . Isaac Newton , Galileo , Plato , Socrates , Karl Marx , Groucho Marx , Darwin , surely Darwin . Kennedy , Bob Dylan , David Beckam . Who invented the telephone ? - Graham Bell ... The light bulb ? - 512 . Everyone says it was Thomas Edison . It was Joseph Swan . Where do these names come from , these memories ? I was taught this stuff by a lady named Mrs. Radcliff , my teacher . - Now , where does that come from ? - Now , tell me about Mrs. Radcliff . You 're humoring me . Tell me , anyway . She had a big blue nose , skin like a crocodile . She actually looked more like a man in a dress . Not just a man , but a boxer . I like her , already . Do you know what a crocodile is ? Are you trying to trap me ? - Are you trying to trap me ? - Yes . Tell me about the woman . I resigned today . That 's why you 're celebrating . Alone . Too bad . I go this way . Really ? Really . - What 's your name ? - Lucy . I 'd like to get to know you , Lucy . Maybe you can . I 'd like to get to know you , tonight . Maybe you can . What 's goin ' on ? You know what it is , Six . 93 deserves a decent burial . You didn 't find his body . 93 is gone ... escaped . - Found the way out . - If 93 found the way out , Six can convince himself that there is an out . Six must try to escape , because Six knows there is nothing to escape from . In his mind , in his soul , Six knows that Six is Six . Need a cab ? Why would I need a cab , if I 'm going into a cafe ? You know , people who go into cafes , come outta cafes , and sometimes , they might need a cab . I don 't know if I 'll need a cab . Why you hassling me , anyway ? I like ya ... You 're a likable man . And I like giving rides in my cab to people I like . Sometimes , being nice is ... It 's just being nice . I 'll always be here , if you need me . If you 're crawling through traffic , hoping to escape for the weekend , think hard , my friends . - It 's the same on the GW ... - Did you hear that ? It 's hell on four wheels out there . Gridlock , after some kind of gas explosion , in the heart of Brooklyn . Put a pillow on his face . Snuffed him out like a ... Snuffed him out like a candle . Now , he 's dead . Need some help here ! I 'm glad I met you , Six . I 'm glad I told you . Perhaps , we can escape together . When you 're better . 93 said ... He said ... " Follow the towers " . Please , back away , sir . Please , back away . Keep calm , now . What is it , terrorists ? - Some kind of resistance ? Tell me . - You should 've stayed away from her . So , what are you saying ? This is my fault ? - No , you tell me , damn it ! - Don 't you see . With every pore of my body , I 'm scared . Sometimes , not very often , something like this happens . And everything goes back to normal . Things , they settle down . They do it for us . Just , please , don 't make things worse , Six . I promise you , you 're safe with me . Two ! Do you hear me ? She 's gone . You did that . She knew there was a way outta here ! And I 'm gonna find it ! I will find a way to escape ! Do you hear me ? I am not a number ! I 'm a free man ! Human beings can be so cruel . You can tell a lot about a person from their apartment . If you know how to look . Here 's to forgetting . Some things . There you are . Here . Don 't you recognize your brother ? He 's not my brother . Why would a man deny the existence ... of his own brother , when he 's standing right in front of you ? Because he 's sick , demented . Isn 't that what you want me to think ? Let us concern ourselves only with evidence . Brought these from home . Remember that ? Stuff could be fake . And does your flesh also lie , Six ? You fell out of a tree and cut your arm . You could have done it , while I was sleeping . We just want you back , the way you were . You 're not gonna catch anything . I did last week . Perhaps therapy might work , yes ? What do you say , Six ? Give the talking cure a try . You would like that , wouldn 't you ? - Meddling with my mind . - What are you afraid of , Six ? A glimpse into your psyche , discovering that you are the problem , after all ? I 'm not afraid . Come on ! Good ... the sessions are booked . A man with nothing to hide is a man with nothing to find . - Good to see you , Six . - Home at last . - Hey , look who it is . - Hey , uncle Six , your not dead . - Hey , good evening . - It 's good to see you . - Hey , Dad - I 've made your favorite for dinner . Barbeque pork wraps . It 's Wonkers ! See , we never miss Wonkers . 46-5 ... Oops , here we go . I don 't like pork . Go on , it 's your favorite . There is something . So 765 is in love with 23-30 , but 23-56 is pregnant to 46-5 , and 913 had an affair with 23-30 . So , 765 is jealous of 23-30 , and so she like , took her revenge by sleeping with 46-5 . - 46-5 - Yes . I 'm leaving you . Why ? I love your brother . You have a lovely family . I know it ... And I 'm proud of it . But it 's not real , is it ? And I 'm not your brother . My brother 's dead , and I 'm somebody else . - It kills me to see you like this . - Did you take anything ? - What ? - Papers from my pocket ? 'Cause maybe you work for them . I don 't know . I only know that none of this is real . If you won 't go to your therapy , then I will . I have to ... because let me tell you , I just want my brother back . And it kills me to ... Why is it so dark in here ? Why does it feel so dark to you ? My home is not my home . My brother 's not my brother . Nothing 's real . And what feels real to you , Six ? Why should I tell you ? Because it bothers you ... Doesn 't it ? You can 't cure your thinking with your thinking . You have to hand it over . There is something in you , which you feel the need to find . You feel the need to resolve it . Am I right ? Let me tell you something interesting . Numbers on a phone , how they work . They have a logic , a purpose . I get the feeling this is not merely information . When you borrowed my phone , the number you dialed , it wasn 't a number . That 's pretty observant . What kind of a guy notices stuff like that ? Just someone suspicious . You didn 't make a call . There was something came into your head ? I saw a seagull this morning . Some kind of bird ? Yeah , some kind of bird . And I got to thinking either you 're a long way from home , or we 're a lot closer to the beach , than I realized . And what is " the beach " ? That 's where you go on vacation . Tell us about your vacation . Not much to tell . Me and my brother , we 'd take the train to the sea . We called it " the edge of the world " . Giant salt water rod for him . An old fishing net for me . Wait a minute , did you just say " us " ? Who 's " us " ? He is me ... We are me . I find it conducive to work in this way . I can engage . - And I can reflect . - I think we 're done here . Wait ! There 's no requirement that you share your thoughts here with me ... us . Simply to have them . Six , wait ! I met your brother . Seems like a sweet man . He spies a lot . I mean , I think he 's a worrier , - I think he 's worried about you , Six - He 's not my brother . Maybe you could accept the possibility that ... Listen to me , I am not a number . Right . There was something in my pockets . Did you take it ? No , there was nothing in your pockets , Six . There you are . What is the one thing that helps a man not well on his troubles ? Work ? Come on , let 's go see the guys . Hey , 130 . Look who 's here . He 's lost some weight , don 't you think ? Looks to me like a man who needs a beer or 12 . We 'll take you out with us tonight , Six . Put some flesh on them bones ? How do you fancy getting behind the old wheel ? Why do you think I can drive this thing ? You 're the best there is , Six . But I 've never driven a bus in my life . Listen to him , boys . How ' bout you just get behind the wheel , and see if it all comes back to ya . Fire her up . As sweet as a honey nut wrap . The Village tour will depart in approximately one minute and 20 seconds . See the sights ! If you 've already seen them , see them again . See ya . Your driver today is , my buddy and my brother , number Six . Coming up here , on your left , is the Village museum of modern art , containing the famous painting of crying 38-30 by 794 . And then , coming up , one of the highlights of our tour , the clinic . Every day is a sunny day in the Village . Moving on now , over to the corner , the newly rebuilt " Solar Cafe " . You were right , of course . He is resistant to the possibility of revealing the Six inside . And why is that ? He feels alone . Very good . He dreams of escape . He feels rootless . And yet , his roots are right here , under our feet . What ails the man ? He described ... a fishing trip . Fishing ? We like Six 's fishing stories ... don 't we , 70 ? Some kind of fantasy . Perhaps you 'd do better trying to find the Two inside . Why not , since I 'm here . We can have a poke around . See what makes Two tick . The inside Two . I 'm curious . I want to know what 's going on inside of me . Let 's start ... My wife ... I 'm the reason she 's the way she is . Perhaps we should stay with the matter of Six . I know I can trust you . I love my son . But , I have thoughts , if he knew me , if he truly know his father , he might not like me . Do you like me , 70 ? You are Two . We all love you . But , do you like me ? I don 't really know you . What I do know is that you are a wonderful man . Of course . You think I believe all of this therapy babble , do you ? My mother sat me sideways on the potty when I was a toddler , so now I want to sleep with her ? Grow up , man ! Have you had sex with your mother , 70 ? No ... never . Well , don 't . If I might ask , if you don 't believe in the value of the talking cure ... It 's not necessary for me to believe . It is necessary for Six to believe . The sight to delights just don 't stop , folks . Actually , this is one of my favorite parts of the trip , the desert . My kids , they always say to me , " Dad , what 's beyond the desert ? " And I tell ' em , " More desert " . Around every dune , there 's another dune , right ? In a few moments , we 're gonna be pulling up for some light refreshments . 91 will be coming around with , some delicious wraps . And remember , take out your cameras . This is one of the best views of the towers . Where are you going ? There 's something I wanna see . A very slight detour ... no cause for alarm . Everyone , this is an unscheduled stop . Can you see it on the map ? Who can tell me what it is ? - Some kind of bus that broke down ? - Not even close . What are you doing ? It 's an anchor . Which means , somewhere around here is a boat , Yeah , or a ship . A ship means water , and water means ocean , right ? What does ocean say to you ... anyone ? This is what 's known as a desert folly , which means it 's a nothing . It 's not . It means escape . Escape for what ? Come on . Something I wanna show you . What is this place ? It 's the ruins . Were there ever trains ? I don 't get you , Six . It 's the ruins . It 's the same as it 's always been . We came here every day , when we were kids . We played soldiers , and hide-and-seek . We used to call it the edge of the world , remember ? How can you forget that ? Guess I do feel something , being here . I can 't deny it . But , why ? Why should I feel belonging , When I 've never been here before ? Try to ask yourself , do you really think that whole family , those kids , are living their lives - just to deceive you ? - Maybe . If you 're right , there 's no way out of here , then . Can 't we have life here ? Isn 't that something ? Two people , like your brother , his family ... That 's what they want us to think . 313 , you ever been on a boat ? Why would I ? You don 't know what you 're missing . I noticed you , sitting on your own . I decided that if I spoke to you , you might wanna get to know me . Is that so bad ? Why tonight ? - Why choose the day that I resign ? - Maybe , it 's a coincidence . Do you know the way ? Every day is a sunny day . It 's Wonkers ! Life is short . It 's the same thing , over and over , day in and day out . It 's like we can never escape . I 'm 16 , your guide . You driver today , my buddy and brother , Number Six . Coming up here , on your left , is the Village philharmonic hall . And then , coming up , one of the highlights of the tour ... the clinic . And next , today , especially for you , the home of our great patron . The one , the only , home of you know who , Palais Two . " Wow , " being the operative word here . Wouldn 't it be amazing if Two came out right now ? He ... Much bigger than on TV . He 's coming . It 's good to see you looking so much better , Six . Driving your bus around , spending time with your brother . Family is the greatest gift the Village can give us . Isn 't that right ? Perhaps one day , you will have a son , Six . I recommend it . It 's only when you have family , that you learn the meaning of love . Do sit down . Are we enjoying our little sight seeing trip ? - Wonderful . - Good . And what do you think of your driver ? There , good news . One family , here on this bus , has won a holiday , to the Escape resort . I have the ticket here . And the lucky family is ... 16 . I 've always wanted to go to Escape resort . Can 't wait to tell the kids . Fantastic . Thank you . And that wraps up our tour for today . I bet you 're all ready for a beer , or 12 . Escape resort . You 're gonna come with us , aren 't you , Six ? This resort , is it by the sea ? A sea ? The sea , the ocean , water , waves . What do you mean , the pool ? You gotta come , Six . Come away with me . Life is short . So come away . You 'd never escape the guilt . 913 wouldn 't care . You would break 46-5 's heart . His wife and his own brother . I can 't let you go . You took them . No , I found them in your pocket . You fool around with me like everything 's a joke . What do you report on me ? Tell ' em what I say to you ? Why 'd you take them ? I like them . I like the idea of another place . I 'm sorry , I don 't wanna lose you ... Lose our friendship . I was being stupid , and look , It won 't happen again . I lied to you . You really are suspicious of people , aren 't you ? You would be too if you worked there . You haven 't told me where you work . I am ... I was an analyst for a company called Summakor . We collect CCTV footage from around the world . I watch people , I see things . I collect data and statistics . My job is to look for patterns , how we live . Trying to find out what is going on , and finding out what is going on is not good news . Is that why you resigned ? Why do you ask ? Why shouldn 't I be interested in you ? Sorry , it 's what that place does to you . What you need is a distraction . You know , I watch people like us , doing things like this , and I write about them in my reports . So , if you were watching us now , what would you see ? Two people , a man and a woman in a room , for one night , 'cause that 's all they 're capable of anymore . Please , tell me that is not true . - It 's only a report ... - It 's what you believe . It 's what I see . It 's ridiculous , I know , but ... I 've been lying awake , thinking , maybe if I came down , they wouldn 't be here . You loved that thing . You always say that . I don 't remember it at all . Memory is fickle . Six says that everything here is fake , unreal . It 's not possible . Why would the world be like that ? It is like that , in Six 's mind . Look at me , 11-12 . Is this real ? Do I love you like no father ever loved a son before ? When I was your age , I questioned everything . Young men always doubt , challenge , but never doubt your family . Never . Steven , come back . Something happened , in you . A memory . Your fishing trip , perhaps . Your brother ? Do you think it would help me to tell you ? I know it would . 765 is in love with 23-30 . 23-56 is pregnant to 46-59 . 913 had an affair with 23-30 , so 765 is jealous of 23-30 . He 's running rings around us ! I see your fear , 70 . I 've been watching you . You know you 're a prisoner . You 're just like me . But you don 't wanna know . I refuse to become you . I do remember something about this place . - Like something happened here . - Doesn 't that make it true ? They do it to me somehow . They do it to all of us . One , two , three , four , five , six . " Hello to you , " whoever you are . " I 'm Six . " I 'm eight years old . " You sound like such a clever little Six . It 's a trick . You knew where it was . You went straight to it . It has to be a trick . Has to be . Tell me why you resigned , please ? I worked on a floor called analysis . We don 't know who works on the next floor . We never see them . I started to notice something , and like a good boy , I reported up . And what was it ? People changing . Too many people . So I sent in the report , got a three-word reply . Cease and desist . But if you could find out why " solutions " wanted you to stop . Who are you ? You work in Summakor . You said " solutions " . I didn 't say " solutions " . No more bullshit . Who are you ? - Yes , I work there . - You sit there , you look at me and you tell me why you 're here ? You think you resigned . Maybe you did , but it 's not over . They still control you . I 'm going on vacation with my brother tomorrow . You called him your brother . Do you see ? I see I need to get out of here , before I become a part of this place . I ... be seeing ya . There 's a reason I go on those bus trips . I heard the ocean once . They stopped the bus . I kind of wandered off away . I heard waves crashing . I heard the ocean . You know , I 'm all for a wild goose chase . I 'm an affirmative kind of guy , generally speaking , but ... I can hear big water ? Somewhere , there 's a sound of splashing ? Please . You mind if we just shut up and drive , please ? Sounds good . It 's non-stop to the Escape resort , departing in approximately four and half minutes . - Where is he ? - I don 't know . She 's a crazy , Six . Man , we are right where we were , and we were here , even before that , and we are right here , again . Maybe it was an illusion . Maybe I never heard it . Listen to me , you did hear something . You have to keep believing that you heard it . I wish I could . - I wish I could hear it now . - Try . Listen . Follow the towers . Two put you up to this , didn 't he ? What ? This talk of the ocean ... He did . He wants to throw me off track . It 's today ! - Where you going , man ? - My family ! I knew you wouldn 't let us down . I told them . Didn 't I tell ya ? Six never missed a vacation . Come on , what are we waiting for ? All right , everyone , we 're all gonna have a nice , normal vacation . You can 't get to the towers ... It 's not possible . You know that , Six . Do you know the way ? You hear me ? You gotta cut this out ! You gotta stop this ! I found something the monster wants . Something of mine from when I was a boy . I keep trying to prove I 'm right , find a way out . But what if I am wrong ? What if I am your brother ? All you 've give me is love and kindness . I 've repaid you with cruel accusations . Maybe I am insane . I 'm sorry for all the pain I 've caused you . You 're a good man . I do trust you . I 'm glad I have a brother . I 'm not your brother . I 'm sorry ! Please , you 've gotta help me , now ! You 've gotta help me . I 'm sorry . I try to be a good father . You know , give them something good to look back on . This place , it 's what you dream of . For a guy like me , it 's out of reach . I 'm scared of them , Six . They 're watching us all the time . Look at me , I 'm shaking like a leaf . Look , I need a beer . What is it they want from me ? They must have told you something . My head is so confused with confusion . I don 't even know if what I just told you is true or not . The other place . Something about you talking about some other place . Are they really your family ? I don 't even know anymore . I know it sounds stupid , but , I sort of do think of you as my brother . Me , too . Is there another place ? There is . You gotta help me get out there . They will get me . They 're gonna get me . No ... we 'll get out first . It isn 't there , is it ? Two will know we were out here . He 'll know that I betrayed him . I promise you , we 'll find it . Steven , come back . 16 , come back . - I 'm only just getting started . - Come on ! Come back here ! It 's gone . I have to tell you something . Uncle Six . Wonkers is on . Your father ... Your father 's dead ! He drowned . 11-12 , none of us can choose our family . He swam in the ocean . Taste the saltwater in his mouth . Felt the power of the waves . There is a way out of this place . No matter how loudly you shout that there isn 't ! You 're the one who 's shouting , Six . The louder a man shouts , - the more profoundly he 's wrong . - I 'm not wrong . I 'm telling you the truth . My brother is dead . Saying these things about his brother . It hurts . Only a family can heal . I didn 't mean that . I didn 't mean my brother . I am not a number ... I am ... My name is ... Damn it ! My name is ... I am Six . He 's Six . - I am Six ! - That 's right . I am Six ... I am Six , you bastard ! The Free Man Team

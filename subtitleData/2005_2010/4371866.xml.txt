 Now , the next chapter of Heroes begins . Last December , Heroes give us a look into the future . But that , was just the beginning . There were strangers who discovered extraordinary abilities ... I think I can fly . ... until they realize they were not alone ... We are all connected . ... with the discovery of one thing . The List . The invincible cheerleader on a mission to find her birth parents . I think I 'm old enough for you to tell me who my real parents are . The mother with an alter ego makes a sacrifice to protect her child . - Can I help you , ma 'am ? - Yeah , you can arrest me . Your mom 's not coming home . And tonight , the search for new heroes begins . How can you see me ? The entire city is in danger . It 's me . Heroes , the next chapter begins ... now . 1x12 God Send You get your mind ready yet , Niki ? Up to me , I 'd leave you in the box here a few more weeks . Even animals like you get a lawyer visit . You just move real slow-like , you hear me ? Nice and easy . Show me your hands ! Come on , get ' em up ! Go on . Let 's go . Union Wells High School opens its doors today for the first time since 16-year-old Jackie Wilcox was brutally murdered during a homecoming game two weeks ago . Teachers and students wrestle with how to remember the slain cheerleader , while still trying to move on . This is Angela Braumstead , Channel 5 News . Look at all those reporters . Don 't worry about the press . They 're not allowed on school grounds . I 'm more worried about the other kids . They 're gonna want to ask me questions about it . Well ... You don 't have to tell them anything . Well , good , 'cause I don 't really remember much . I mean , I know that 's supposed to be post-traumatic stress or whatever , but nothing ? Nothing at all ? Memory 's a funny thing . I think it 's a blessing that you don 't remember . Where 'd you find me ? What do you mean ? The night Jackie got killed . You said you found me by the stadium ? You were scared to death . You were traumatized , you just wanted to go home . I don 't remember . Thanks . I guess I better go . Not so dangerous anymore , are we , Mr. Sylar ? We 've gone over every strand of code , trying to find the code on switches that identify his aptitudes . Other than telekinesis , we 're drawing a blank . Has he responded to the glycimerine ? Given him enough to kill an elephant . Nothing . We 're no closer . If we keep up at this rate , he 'll be dead by tomorrow . After what he did to Eden , he 'd deserve it . Unfortunately , they haven 't authorized that . He stays alive . You 're just gonna have to dig deeper . You better be right about this , Parkman . Let 's go , come on ! Come on , let 's go . We swept this entire place . There 's nothing here but paper . - Did you check the basement ? - Yeah ! Stairwells ? More paper . Where is he ? Where is he ? Where 's Sylar ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . He 's not here , Parkman . Nice going . The Tyrannosaurus Rex was a huge , meat-eating dinosaur that lived during the late Cretaceous Period about 65 to 85 million years ago . If we could go back in time , there 's no telling what wonders we 'd find ... He 's burning up . Persistent idiopathic fever . Means they have no idea what 's wrong . Find the best doctors in the world , just to have them tell me they don 't know what they 're doing in 4 different languages . His heart- - they don 't know how much more he can take . 26 years old , he 's gonna die of a heart attack ? He 's not gonna die , Ma . Well , he will unless I do something . Why don 't you just let the doctors do what they do ? I wish I knew what was going on in there . Just before he passed out , he said he , uh ... He felt he was absorbing too many powers . Peter wanted to see that painting . After I told you not to let him , you knew he was gonna follow that thing headfirst all the way to Texas . He 's my brother and I love him , but we both know he shouldn 't have even been there . It was important to him . You really believe all this crap ? Future paintings ? - The end of the world ? - I know he believes it . And I believe in him . Fine . Then show me . I 've been here for two weeks , waiting for something to happen . I 'll be damned if I 'm gonna sit around and watch my brother die . Take me to the artist . I want to see what 's worth all this . I love you , man . There . Okay , your first mistake ? Never put the peanut butter in the refrigerator . Mom always keeps it at room temperature . Well , your dad 's got his own style . I see that . It still tastes good . What happened to you ? Did you get in a fight at school today ? It 's nothing . - Just some jerks . - Well , what happened ? Dad , they called Mom a psycho killer . I know , you can lecture me about not fighting . No , I ... I know how hard it is without her . And I wish it could be easier . But we gonna make it . You enjoy that . I 'll be back . I believe you were expecting me ? The name is Malski . Aaron Malski . I take it you have it here ? Have the charges against me been dropped ? Your wife 's confession took care of most of that . Her pointing out where to find the bodies helped too . As for the other charges , consider yourself a free man , Mr. Hawkins . So no more looking over my shoulder ? Only if you wish to see where you 've been . So that 's it . Linderman leaves me and my family alone ? Oh , I wouldn 't bank on that , no . That was the deal . You got back your $ 2 million . There is no deal , Mr. Hawkins , unless Mr. Linderman says there 's a deal . You took something of his . And he reserves the right to let you make that up to him . Believe me . You 'll be the first to find out when he chooses to call in that debt . You have a nice day now . I 'm glad the Bureau finally decided to take the list I offered seriously . Too many people showing up dead or missing . If you didn 't have a record showing you were in India when some of these people were killed , you and I would be having a very different conversation . How fortunate for me , then . You say , uh ... your father compiled this list ? Yes , he was a geneticist . All the people on the list share a unique genetic marker that he was able to map and track using the Human Genome Project . I 've been trying to locate them . To warn them . About this man Sylar ? Yes , the man who killed my father . I see . Well , we ran the name . Nothing . Clearly an alias . But we did follow up on a- - another name you said was on the list . Sarah Ellis ? Yes , I tried to locate her in Los Angeles , but she wasn 't at any of her known addresses , and no , I 've never met her before . Are you sure ? That 's Sarah Ellis ? I know her by a different name . Eden McCain . She , uh- - Lives across the hall right there . She 's been gone for a few weeks . Is there a problem ? She turned up three days ago . Well ... what was left of her , anyway . What ? Yeah , they pulled her out of Lake Ramsey in Sudbury . Hundred miles out of Ontario . Gunshot wound to the head . Local law wrote it up as a suicide . The , uh ... last I heard from her , she said she had something to confess to me . You say she was your friend ? She- - I don 't know what she was . The guy who you were just talking to has Sylar in this building . - No , Parkman . - Yes , he- - He doesn 't . There 's nothing in here but paper . But we didn 't look everywhere . Maybe- - maybe- - there 's a secret room . Somewhere . Okay ? Maybe- - And maybe I can whistle The Star-Spangled Banner out of my ass . We are lucky he hasn 't threatened to sue us for this stunt . You want to know what 's on this tape he just handed me ? You . Caught on the parking lot surveillance camera . What , you didn 't think anyone would notice a guy sitting in the same car every day for two weeks ? Do you have any idea the position you have put this Bureau in ? I was following a hunch . Whose hunch ? My hunch ? The Bureau 's hunch ? - Matt 's hunch . - He abducted people . He abducted me ! He abducted Ted Sprague ! Sure , the guy with the radioactive hands ? Well , it all makes perfect sense . I am going to make sure you are benched for this . What , that 's it ? Obviously . We both know he 's in here . - I know- - - Do we ? Because all I know is that I have wasted the last three weeks of my life on the crazy idea that you can hear people 's thoughts . I liked you , Matt . I felt sorry for you . And maybe that clouded my judgment . But now I need to get back to reality . And you should do the same . Go home , Matt . We 're done . Listen to me . I have no idea how you 're pulling this off , but I swear to God I 'm not gonna stop until I figure it out , you understand me ? Good luck with that . Zach . Hey , this is a public place . Are you sure you can be seen here with me ? Why not ? Right , I forgot . You 've been body-snatched . Look , I just want to talk . Hey , I 'm sorry about Jackie . I know she was your best friend and all . No , I actually discovered that someone else was my best friend . But I lost him too . What happened to you at Homecoming ? I can 't remember . Can 't remember a lot of things lately . Yeah , it 's , uh ... That 's funny , ' cause lately , I can 't remember ... - Must be something in the water , right ? - Zach , look at me . Do you feel like we could be friends ? Us ? We wouldn 't play well together . I gotta to tell you , Ms. Sanders , the outbursts are not helping . Kind of getting tired of them myself . Look , I just want to do my time in peace . Yeah , about that ... it seems the D. A. is going to file for special circumstances in the homicides . They 're gonna seek the death penalty . Death penalty ? Look , I know it 's a long shot . But it might help if you cooperated a little . And how am I supposed to do that ? The $ 2 million , things might go a little smoother if you tell the police where it is . I 've told you . I don 't know anything about that . Who are you trying to fool ? You know exactly where it is . I 'm sorry ? He 's right , Niki . We should tell them . Stop it ! Don 't pay any attention to her . Pay attention to who ? God , who am I gonna have to screw to get out of this place ? I said stop it ! What is this ? What 's it look like , dipstick ? Wait , you 're going psych on me ? If that 's what it takes . Multiple personality disorders are a real hard sell . When I want your opinion , I will ask for it . Just get us a damn shrink . I 'm not crazy . No , I 'm not crazy . Don 't listen to her . Please , I 'm telling you the truth . - Of course . - Don 't listen to her . Listen to me , please . - I 'm not lying to you . - Of course you 're not . - I 'm telling you the truth ! Which way to gift store ? Thank you . Isaac was obsessed , ranting about a bomb coming to explode New York . - The painting on the floor . - Yeah , and he just left . Someone came and took his paintings . And I don 't understand . He 's been gone a few weeks . Then I came back . I 'm waiting for the shock to clear so I can tell if you 're glad to see me . Well ... I 'm just going to , uh ... You look ... you look healthy . I got back a few days ago . I wasn 't sure when to call you . I was in a clinic . I barely remember any of it , but when I woke up , I was in Texas . And I was clean . that 's great . I mean it . I don 't need the drugs anymore , I can paint without it . Well , I 'm glad for you . I 'm only alive because of you , Simone . I still love you . All right , uh , this painting ... that 's- - it 's like he 's exploding . Like he 's- - like he 's a bomb . How did you know about this ? Did you talk to my brother Peter ? I painted what I saw . The last thing Peter said before he collapsed was that he ... was the cause of the explosion . Look , I may not get everything . That 's fine , but this ... This- - these things can 't be connected . And the world doesn 't work like this . Bad news , sword not there . It was replica . Original owned by man named Linderman . Did he say Linderman ? Flying Man ! Save the cheerleader , save the world . What does that even mean ? Have I been saved , or do I still need saving ? You 're saved for the time being . I wanna talk to Peter Petrelli . You 're not supposed to remember Peter Petrelli . He 's being watched . If you try to contact him , your father will know . You have to give me something . Nothing in my life has been real . My dad obviously doesn 't work in a paper factory . I don 't know what he does . And what about my biological parents ? He didn 't find them through the adoption agency , did he ? They work for your father . Like I do . Everything has been a lie . The only person I could trust was Zach , and you took him from me . That was your father 's doing . - Not mine . - Then give him back his memories . I don 't wanna be alone . You are not alone , Claire . And I cannot give your friend back his memories . It 's not how my gift works . Your gift ? That what you call it ? What do you call it ? My own private freak show . What you can do , what I can do , that is God . Respect it accordingly . The bomb , it comes from the street . Destroy everything , everything turn into dust . Your English is a lot better . - I met a waitress in Texas . - Oh , yeah ? She teach me many things . Good for you . So , look , I can 't believe I 'm about to say this . You teleported here ... back from the future . Yes , my power let me come back here so I can stop it . Right . Because " you hero . " You will help too . Me ? - What makes you so sure ? - You 're flying man . Would you keep it down ? What do you think it is that makes this bomb thing go off ? Don 't know ... probably bad guy ? - Bad guy ? - Yes . Like villain . - What 's that ? - Villain . - Villain ? - Villain . - Villain . - Vee . - V. - Vee-yun . Like the guy in the painting ? You think a human being can actually cause an explosion ? I have power , you have power . Maybe he has power too . Bad guy . We must stop him . I think I can help . We 've been here before . You , me , the video camera . Is it at all familiar ? What are you doing , auditioning for America 's Next Top Model ? You made that joke the first time . Look , just keep the camera on me , okay ? Why don 't you just use a tripod ? I can 't do this by myself . And I know you can keep a secret , you did . You did , until you forgot what it was . When we were best friends . You ready ? Claire , hold on a second . I 'm sure you told me this ... before , but , umh , why are we videotaping this ? Whatever this is . Actually , I didn 't tell you that before . The first time I did this I did it to show my parents . My real parents . I wanted them to see what I was . I thought they could help me understand . But I don 't think I 'm ever gonna meet them . They may not even be alive anymore . So why do you wanna tape it now ? For me . So I never forget what I am . No matter what happens to me . Look , just don 't freak out , okay ? I won 't . You said that last time . Camera 's ready for whatever . Okay , I 'm ready . Keep the camera on me . What are you doing ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God- - Claire ! This is Claire Bennett . And as far as you know , that was attempt number one . I don 't know how much longer I 'm gonna be here . And what 's that supposed to mean ? They 're sending me to the psych ward , for an evaluation with a shrink . She 's here . She came out , she tried to escape , she hurt one of the guards . Maybe a shrink can help you deal with her . Get rid of her . This isn 't in my head , D. L. She is real . I should 've never let you do this , Nik , get yourself thrown in here . I shoulda kept that money to help you out . You had to give it back , or else this would never be over . Let me talk to Micah . I want you to come home . I know , sweetie . But I can 't . It 's hard to understand right now . But I hope that one day you will . Y - your daddy , he 's gonna take real good care of you while I 'm gone . I need you to be the strong one because I 'm not strong right now , okay ? Mom , that 's not fair . That 's my son . Can I just give him a hug ? - Just for a second , I promise . - Baby , it 's okay . It 's all right . No , he needs me . He needs me . Just let me hold him . - Stay right there - He needs me . - I said stay there ! - Please . I 'm warning you . Please . Just for a moment . I just wanted to see my son . I don 't even know what she fed you . They eat crickets . Lots of crickets . You . Hope you don 't mind , I let myself in . Have you come to kill me now ? That depends . I 'd like to talk to you about Eden . She worked for me . Don 't you mean Sarah Ellis ? She gave up that name and that life a long time ago . And she was a good person . Yes , of course , all spies are very good people . Just misunderstood . She cared about you more than she should 've . She was .. - ... special . - She had an ability ? What was it ? Suffice it to say , she learned how to use it wisely . Not everyone who has these abilities deserves them . And who are you to judge ? In fact , who are you , period ? I made a mistake . - I should 've come to you before . - You 've been spying on me for weeks . In India , my cab , bugging my phone . We need to help each other , Dr. Suresh . And why would I help you ? You need me , don 't you ? My father , he knew more than you do . From what we could observe , yes . If you 've been watching , you know my father 's formula doesn 't work . We both know that he generated a list . Who 's on that list is a matter of grave importance . You 've come for it ? You want to find them ? Why do you seem so worried ? Are you on the list ? You 've no doubt realized things can go terribly wrong with these abilities . If you work with me , we can control that . If and when I do figure out this list , the first thing I 'm going to do is warn these people . About you . Together , we could actually make a difference . Sorry , not interested . Contact me when you change your mind . The access number 's on the back . Are you back ? Yeah . I took out that suitcase this morning . But I haven 't packed it yet . I know that we 're in trouble . And I know that a lot of it is my- - most of it is my fault Janice , we- - we need to start being completely honest with each other , come clean about everything . Okay . 'Cause there 's something I gotta tell you , something has happened to me . ... really hard to explain . Just say it . I can hear people 's thoughts . Meaning what ? I hear their thoughts . What they 're thinking . It started a few weeks ago . That 's why I 've been with the FBI all this time . What do you mean ? Like , a psychic or something ? I don 't know . I guess . You can 't be serious . Yeah . You don 't believe me . Okay , that 's all right . Here , come here . All right . Pick a number between one ... and a million . Come on , bring it on . I took his power , Nathan . I can 't control it ! Let me help you , Peter . You can 't ! I 'm not leaving you . Ma ? - Where is he ? - I have no idea . - He woke up . - He woke up ? Yes . He was raving . After two weeks spent sitting at his bedside , thinking he could die , he says he 's gotta get away . You just let him leave ? No , I just did not let him leave and when I see him , I will kill him . Mom ... all right , look . Just go home , okay ? Get some rest . I 'll take care of it . You 're really Hiro Nakamura from Isaac 's comic book ? I worked there , at Yamagato , We fly here , and we drive that car everywhere . Blue Nissan Versa . It 's parked outside right now . I 'm just like Mr. Isaac draw me , except my face not so round . Okay , yeah . I give up . The world is insane , I 'm not gonna keep fighting it . You can paint the future ! And he needs a sword . This guy Linderman ? He 's a client of mine . Huge collector . He buys every painting of Isaac 's he can . I can get you in there . Get your car , you 're going back to Vegas . I need the , uh , first flight out of New York into the desert . I don 't know . Nevada , maybe ? That 's where they did all those nuclear bomb tests , right ? Okay . Yeah , Las Vegas . Las Vegas is good . Yeah , whatever . Yeah , I 'll hold . What are you do- - hey ! You can see me ! You- - Nobody sees me ! Do ya hear me ? Nobody sees me ! I 'm invisible ! In the beginning , there was discovery . A confusion of elements , the first snowfall of impossible change . Old lives undone , left behind . Strange faces made familiar ... new nightmares to challenge sleep . New friends to feel safe with . Only then comes control . The need to impose order onto chaos , through determination , through study , through struggle ... She 's gonna be okay . You know that , right ? You 'd tell me the truth , right ? ... all in defiance of a thundering truth . They 're here . And the earth shudders underfoot . Oh , God ... Lights out . Please help me . Who needs God when you 've got me ?

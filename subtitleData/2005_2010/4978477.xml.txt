 Come on , Tyler . Tyler , just stop it . I haven 't got time to muck around . Tyler ! All right , I 'll just leave you there . Is that what you want ? If I just leave you ? In the middle of town ? We 're going to be late . Suzette ! Stop it , you 're just looking silly , d 'you want other people to see you , looking silly ? . If he gives you any more trouble , your dad 's going to punch his face in . I 'll punch his bloody mother . Have you got that , David ? I 've booked the car for 7.30 , but I might have to leave it on standby . If Baxter starts talking , he never stops , so I can 't guarantee what time . I 'll tell you what , I 'll send you a text when I 'm on the motorway . Steven ! if you leave the front door open , those cats are going to get in . Darling , don 't just stand there , you 're gonna be late . Steven . Steven ? Stop playing games ! Get out of the way ! Oi ! I said bloody shift , man ! David ? Are you listening to me ? Mica ? Oi , you two ! Look at me ! See ya then ! And you can shut up an ' all , you were the one crying , you were like a baby , I seen you . Was not . Was . Was not . You two , you 're gonna be late . We 're going ! Look ! I 'm going round to Polly 's later , see ya , bye ! What ? You are pushing it , you are , young man . Come on ! All right , Glyn ? What 's occurring ? I 've been watching the bay . No sea monsters . Ah , still early . Anyone in ? You two having shenanigans in the dark ? Jack ? Morning . Clear ! And again ! Charging 200 . Clear ! I think we should call it , everyone agree ? OK . Time of death , 09.17 . Sally , I can leave it with you , yeah ? I 'll go and tell them . I 'm sorry . We did everything we could , but he didn 't make it . Oh , that 's a shame . Very sad . Poor old Mr Williams . Very sad indeed . There 'll have to be an autopsy , but I 'd say his heart gave out . Brave old heart . You were neighbours , is that right ? We live next door . He 's got no family to speak of . All on his own . We 'd just keep an eye on him , y 'know . Well , I 'm sure he appreciated it . If only there were more like you two in the world . I know it 's an imposition , but with us being such good neighbours ... Can we see the body ? Bless him . God rest his soul . Say , d 'you think we could , er ... ? Just on our own , um ... Course you can . Just come and find me , once you 're done . And I 'm sorry for your loss . Thank you . He thought we were together . Like a couple . He said , " You two . " The way he said it , huh . " You two . " Well , we are . Does it matter ? I dunno , it 's all a bit new to me , that 's all . Laser saw . Thank you . Tongs . Tongs . Almost ... .. got it . Sorry , one more ... There ! What ? Now , look at it , that 's not human , is it , does that look human ? No , it does not . It 's just a hitchhiker he picked up , it didn 't kill him . Some say they 're positively beneficial , they release endorphins . He died a happy man . And I 've got Tupperware . And we 're very considerate , we don 't leave any mess . Thank you very much . We 'll just get out of your way . Wait a minute , wait a minute ! Whatever it was , that was mutilation , I should report you . Then why don 't you ? But that thing , what the hell was it , that hitchhiker ? Try putting it into a report . You 're Torchwood ? Never heard of ' em . There are bodies going missing ! How many ? This whole city talks about you . What bodies , where ? It started two months ago . Bodies , taken down to the mortuary , then the records just stop . Five of them . Five in two months . And none of them white . One of West Indian decent , one African , three Chinese , all male . What was your name again ? Rupesh . Rupesh Patanjali . What d 'you think ? NHS . Yeah . Too much red tape . Sorry . But good luck with it ! Don 't ! Look , wait a minute ! Oh , Christ . Good morning , sir . Morning . Morning to you , too . Colonel Oduya for you , sir . Unscheduled . I 'd remind you , you 've got the Category Meeting at quarter past . You 'd better come through . Thank you . I 'm late ! I 'm sorry ! Oh , my God , I 'm really , really sorry ! Good morning . Bridget Spears . Lois Habiba . Right . This will be your desk . Just tell me it 's something small . Tell me it 's a ... It 's a meteorite ! Or a shadow on the moon . Just for once , tell me it 's easy . Might be nothing , sir . But it 's my job to inform the Government , even if it turns out to be a false alarm . Then what is it ? Children , sir . It 's the children . You are gonna get us killed ! No , you get killed , not me . You 'd die like a dog , like an ugly dog ! Oi , Chuckle Brothers . I found something . I want a check on St Helen 's Hospital morgue . There 's a computer , do it yourself . I 've got reports this morning of 17 traffic accidents , happening across the country , from Glasgow to St Ives . Is that above average ? Well , they all occurred between 8.40 and 8.41 . 17 road traffic accidents happening in exactly the same minute ? Every single one of them involving children . That 'll be the school run . All of them were just standing in the road . Not crossing the road , just standing . I saw it myself , Jack . Two kids on Market Street . Well , they just stopped . But the accidents are just one part of a picture . Because every other child stopped at the same time . And not just in Britain . Same reports from France . 15 road traffic accidents . All timed around 9.40 . They 're an hour ahead , so it was simultaneous . All involving children ? Yup . Hold on . Cross-referencing . Here we go . Reports coming in , RTAs in Norway . Sweden . Denmark . Luxembourg . Germany . India . Egypt . Guyana . Spain . Portugal . Bosnia . Tokyo . Singapore . At 8.40 GMT , most of America was asleep , but even there , we 're beginning to get reports . I think we can assume it 's all of them , sir . As far as we can tell , at 8.40 this morning , every single child in the world stopped . Seen anything like this before , Jack ? No way . Kids ? Until we receive further information , we don 't know if it 's extraterrestrial in origin . Though the United Nations has taken UNIT up to yellow alert , just in case . Bloody hell . And Colonel Mace ? How is he getting on ? He 's fine . Wouldn 't mind a post in Vancouver myself . Wonderful countryside , so they say . Nice for some . Sorry . My name 's Lois , Lois Habiba . Just started today . I 'm helping out Miss Spears while they introduce the new computer system . Thank you . All done . What 's his uniform ? That 's not British Army , is it ? If you could start transferring the names and addresses . You have two daughters , is that right ? Yeah . Maybe I should get them home from school . I 'd be careful , sir . I wouldn 't do anything to draw any attention . Right now , this thing 's random enough to go unnoticed , and if anyone files a news report , we 'll be crushing it . But , so far , we 're the only ones with the software clever enough to piece this all together . Well , us and Torchwood . D 'you want me to talk to them ? They 're a pain in the backside , but they can be helpful . We 're on to them , right now . OK , find out anything , let me know immediately . Of all the times for Martha Jones to go on holiday . I get Sergeant Grunt . I 'm talking to a sergeant ! Don 't you dare phone her , she 's on her honeymoon . What did they say ? UNIT base in Washington has run some tests on a couple of kids . Brain scans , blood sugar , checking for radiation . Nothing . You were right ! He 's back ! Ha ! Ha ! I said so ! Who 's back ? What 's he doing ? Waiting . Just like you said . He 's been there 20 minutes . Persistent . Good sign . Dogmatic . Always a plus . Oh , Christ , never work with a couple - you two talk like twins ! Now tell me who he is . Rupesh Patanjali . He saw the hitchhiker , he 's the bodies-going-missing man . Dr Patanjali . We need a doctor . You let just him follow you ? Ask about Torchwood , and most people point towards the Bay . Oh . You bastards , that 's exactly what you did to me the first time we met ! Well , sod that , I 'm promoting myself to recruitment officer ! She 's calling us a couple now . What 's your problem ? Just saying . I hate the word " couple " . Me too . Hey . Rupesh , isn 't it ? Yeah . Gwen Cooper . I 'm Torchwood . Three of the bodies were Chinese ? Were they related ? No , one was 27-years-old and the other two were in their 50s . But not from the same family . Bit odd , though , statistically . In a city this small . That 's what I thought . Mind you . Nothing compared to that hitchhiker . Freak you out ? Oh , yeah ! Yeah , me too . Apparently , anyone could have one . Don 't ! I know ! This place ! Ever since I moved here , it 's just weird . Where you from then ? Me ? I 'm from Chesterfield . Came down here , 18 months back . Enjoying it ? Very much , yeah . I bet it doesn 't pay you much though . Not at first . Could be worse . Torchwood 's paid by the Crown . First pay cheque , I almost fell over . Had to hide it from my boyfriend . I was buying clothes , had to stash them under the bed . What 's it like , inside Torchwood , I mean , what do you do ? Why are you so interested ? Well . From what I 've heard , it sounds ... I dunno . Exciting ? I suppose . Glamorous ? No , more , sort of ... The thing is , we 've all seen it now , the past few years . Alien life . Even though half the world 's still denying it . For me ... OK . It 's the suicides . The past few years , suicide rates have doubled , and that 's ever since the first alien . My first case , my first death , was a suicide . D 'you know why she did it ? Cos she 'd written all these letters , she 'd been a Christian all her life , and then alien life appears . She wrote this bit , she said , " It 's like science has won . " Lost her faith . More than that . She said she saw her place in the universe , and it was tiny . She died because she thought she was nothing . I went through that . Even now , I get terrified . But at the same time , it is brilliant , and beautiful , and completely bloody magic . It 's bigger , y 'know ? It 's like ... It 's like the whole wide world is bigger . My life is bigger . Shit ! Sasha , love , I haven 't got time . I 've got to be in work . Jack ! Get up here ! It 's happening again ! The children ! They 're doing it again ! Are you all right ? We 're fine , she 's just playing a game . OK . Now come on , sweetheart , people are staring at you ! Sasha , stop it . What 's she doing ? I don 't know ! Sasha ! Stop it ! Please help her ! There 's another one ! It 's all right , it 's all right , I 'm a doctor . We . We . We . We . We . We . We . We . We . Whoa ! We are . We are . We are . We are . We are . We are coming . We are coming . Oh , my God ! We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . Who 's got children ? Find me a kid , find me a bloody kid , now ! He won 't stop , he keeps saying the same thing , over and over . We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . We are coming . Sasha , please , my God ! Who are you ? Who 's coming ? Come on then . Why is that man filming us ? Are we gonna be on telly ? You all right ? They 've found me . Gwen , I 'll get on to the Home Office . This has gone public . They 're gonna need us . Whoa ! Where 'd you think you 're going ? Um . I dunno . I could help . Doing what ? You 're bleeping . Shit , yeah , sorry . Whole city 's coming to a standstill , they 're gonna need you in AE . We 'll get back to you , I promise . What 's in there ? Big science-fiction superbase . Honestly ! See ya . I 'm sorry , we 've got no comment . Can we leave it for now ? I 'm sorry , he 's not seeing anyone at the moment . The Home Secretary 's demanding information , sir ... No , I 'm sorry I don 't know who that is . I 'm new . Anyone else , just tell them no , Bridget . No more calls . I 'll have to abandon the press list , can you set up an autoreply ? You 'll have to get into my account , that 's the username , spears , password Hastings , capital H , rest of it lower case . Right . Bridget , I want to see Mr Frobisher . Will you excuse me , please . Sir ? I said , no-one . Mr Dekker , sir . Four , five , six . I warned you . Tell him it 's Captain Jack Harkness , he 'll take the call . I 'm sorry , I can 't . If you could just leave your number or ... 'Tell him it 's Torchwood . ' Right , and how do you spell that ? You work for the Home Office and you 've never heard of Torchwood ? I 'm new . Started today . Just what I need ! Sorry . Not your fault . You picked a hell of a day . 'Just tell him Torchwood , W - O-O-D . ' We might be able to help , OK ? What was your name ? Lois , Lois Habiba . Good luck to you , Lois Habiba . Right . Too many people here ... Been a while since we had visitors down here . Thought you 'd forgotten about us . It 's hardly the glamorous side of Thames House , my little domain . We converted the readings onto digital , years ago , but I kept the original equipment . Call it nostalgia . Then this morning it woke up . 8.40 , and again at 10.30 , transmitting on the 456 . Just five seconds in duration . But that 's enough . What 's it saying ? Well , I think it 's a burst of compressed information . I 'm running it through the translators , might take a while . But the point is , the 456 was open . But why would they change ? That 's your job , to find out . I 'll have to tell the Prime Minister . Elected officials ? ! They just come and go . The 456 was here before him , it 'll be here long after he 's gone . And so will we . The Civil Service , John , the cockroaches of government . Have you got kids ? Too busy working . Turns out to be a Godsend . So I think it 's a transmission , a pulse , a broadcast . Like the Mosquito alarm - the one that only kids can hear . Unique to prepubescents . Maybe testosterone interferes with the signal , and oestrogen ... Oh , no , no , no , hold on . We 're being dumbos , we 're missing the bleedin ' obvious here , look . Recorded in Taiwan . The point being , anyone ? We are coming . We are coming . It 's English . They 're speaking English . Exactly ! And all the footage is the same . So every single child in the whole wide world is speaking English , so why 's that ? I guess if you scanned the Earth from the outside , you 'd register English as the dominant language . That would be Chinese - Mandarin . There 's a billion people speaking Mandarin . That 's three times more than English . Oh , my God . What ? OK , ready ? So every single child in the world is talking in unison , yeah ? Yeah . Yup . Every single child ... And one man . We are coming . We are coming . What the hell ? Who 's he ? Name 's Timothy White . He 's a patient in a psychiatric ward at the Duke Of York Hospital , East Grinstead . How did you get this footage ? Staff e-mailed it to the police . But every police force is swamped with mums and dads going absolutely mental , so it 's just waiting in line . I reckon no-one else has noticed him yet . East Grinstead . That 's what , two hours ? I 'm on it ! 'I know I promised , shut up . Change of plan . ' Oh , s 'all right , I thought you 'd be busy . " We are coming ! " Eh , but what 's it like ? The estate agent hasn 't turned up . Fair dos , she 's probably got kids . So , what do you think 's causing it ? I can 't say . Top secret . You haven 't got a clue , have you ? No idea . Tell you what , it looks nice from the outside . I reckon we could knock ten grand off the asking price . Three bedrooms . One could be a nursery . Oh , stop it ! One day ! You can adopt a Filipino and get her to clean the chimneys . I was thinking though , right ? Those kids went off at 8.40 , when everyone 's on their way to school , then at 10.30 , that 's break time . It 's like it was timed . So you 'd get maximum kids out in the open , visible to everyone . Suppose . Yeah , but that means it 's timed around Britain . Specific British hours , yeah ? It might be worldwide , but I reckon someone 's looking right at us . That 's brilliant . That is brilliant , you 're not bad , you , are you ? I 'm bloody superb . Oh , my God , Severn Bridge ! I 'm going into England ! Farewell forever ! Good luck ! Have you got currency ? Yes , and I 've had my injections ! See ya ! Lunch time . This place should be buzzing with kids . Everyone 's taken them home . We need a child . Cos we need to test those frequencies . Find the right frequency , and we can find out who 's transmitting . Where d 'you get a child , though ? I could find you lasers and weevils and hitchhikers . But kids ... See you later . Where are you going ? Now who 's a couple ? When I was a kid , it was the bomb . Iron Curtain . Reds under the bed . It was all so bloody simple . Now it comes raining down from the skies . Made of metal , stinking green and God knows what . I find myself running a country under siege from above . What d 'you recommend that we do ? You tell me . Given that this is now worldwide , Prime Minister , it might be best if certain historical events were taken off the record . So Britain gets a clean sheet ? Yes , sir . How do we know if these ... what do we call them ? The 456 . They never gave a name . We just called them the 456 after the frequency allocation . Then how do we know that the 456 will keep quiet ? We don 't . All we can do is hope to cover ourselves . You 'll have to issue a Blank Page . No . Then , what do we do ? I 'm not having my name on this . You never told me . I was never a part of it . I never knew . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Then I take it that that leaves the Blank Page with me ? Just don 't tell me about it . Tell her it 's in the bottom drawer , I put them there yesterday , yeah ? Oh , I thought so . Good to see you . How 's things ? Terrifying . Uncle Jack ! Steven ! Hey , soldier , how you doing ? I was talking like an alien ! Everyone was ! It was brilliant ! You 'd better come in . Only me . Oh , bloody hell . We must be in trouble . Or is it Christmas ? How are they ? Yeah , it was a bit of a scare . I brought them home , just in case . I reckon it 's that group hysteria thing , like when lots of girls all faint at the same time . Did you say thanks to your uncle ? I did . David ! Your Uncle Ianto 's here ! I was thinking . I missed Mica 's birthday . I thought I could take her to McDonald 's . That 's all of £ 3.95 , you big spender . All right , cinema . Yeah , that 'd be nice . You 'd like that , wouldn 't you , Mica ? I thought maybe this afternoon . No chance . What about Saturday ? I 'm kind of busy on Saturday . You 're a civil servant , they don 't work weekends . They invented weekends . And I 'm not having her going out , not today , not with all that voice thing . I want ' em where I can see them . But she 'll be with me . She 's staying put . Right . Fine . Just an idea . I won 't bother you . Oh , that 's it , is it ? You 're just gonna go now ? Oh , sit down , you daft sod . I 've got some of that spinach dip . And you and me , well , we 've got things to talk about . What things ? You 've been seen . They said on the news that we should send them back to school tomorrow . D 'you think it 's safe ? Well , I don 't know any more than you . Oh , come on . I don 't . Any word from Joe ? In Italy . With her . They finally got married . But he , er ... He phones every now and then , and sends Steven postcards . Remembers his birthday . There are worse fathers . How are you off for money ? Don 't worry about that . You give me enough . Kind of easy , writing cheques , huh ? Alice , you 're the one who asked me to stay away . I 'd come round here every week , if you wanted me to . Every day . Yeah . I just can 't stand it , Dad . I look older than you do and it 's never gonna stop . I get older and older and you stay the same . One day , you 're gonna be standing at my funeral . Looking just like you did when you were standing at Mum 's . No wonder she was so furious . You make us feel old . Actually , I found a grey hair . Oh ! Well , that is the end of the world . You ever gonna tell him ? What do I say ? That you 're his grandfather ? He 's too young to notice , right now . That I don 't age . But one day , he 's gonna realise . And that 's another reason for you to stay away . I suppose . I could make the most of it while he 's still young . Take him out . Buy him stuff . Me and him , sort of thing . You mean today ? While I 'm here , may as well . You bastard . Something happens to kids , and you want to spend time with him on the same day . You are not experimenting on that boy , Dad . Not ever . That 's why I want you to stay away , because you 're dangerous . Dr Patanjali . You were paging me ? Rupesh ! Captain Jack Harkness . You 've got a children 's ward , haven 't you ? I need a kid . Susan on the corner was in town and it was her anniversary , so they went to that posh French place by the memorial , and there was you . So ... ? There was you , having dinner with a man . So ? Having dinner , with a man , in a restaurant . So ? You have dinner with Tina . Not in town . Susan said he was gorgeous . Like a film star . Like an escort . He 's my boss . She said it was intimate . I said , " Well , he 's had girlfriends , " and she said , " Well , no girl was getting her feet round that table , no chance . " Have you gone bender ? Mica 's hearing this . She 's not bothered . Her friend Sian 's got two mothers . Go on . You never tell me anything these days . Dad died , that was it , you were off . You couldn 't wait . Like I did something wrong . I didn 't , did I ? It 's not that . It 's my job , it 's difficult , it 's ... He is very handsome . No ! Now stop it . You 're kidding me ! Really , though ? Really ? Christ almighty ! He 's nice , though ? Is he ? Is he ? Oh , my God . I mean , since when ? It 's weird , it 's just different . It 's not ... men . It 's just him . It 's only him . And I don 't even know what it is , really . So ... So I 'm not broadcasting it . Oh , no , honest , I won 't say . If you want it kept quiet , I swear , I won 't say a word , I promise . Aye aye , gay boy , she says you 're taking it up the arse . Mica , will you get off that thing . Thanks . How 've you been then , you smart bastard ? Eh , whose car is that outside , is that you ? Black thing ? That 's the company car . You want to watch it on this estate , boy . No , it 's fine , it 's got a triple-deadlock . Oh , aye , sounds like it . Oh ! But it 's got a triple deadlock , they can 't have ! They drive round the block , then they come back for a lap of honour . The victory parade ! We should phone the police . It 's more fun this way . Right , here they come ! Get ready ! Yay ! David ! Get inside ! Now ! That 's my car ! I 'm not telling you again , get inside . I 'll take your computer off you , get in . That 's my car . Timothy White . 52 years old . He 's been with us three months . But he 's got a history of being in and out of care all his life . Timothy White 's . My mum used to shop there . If he 's got a different name , he 's never said . He spent 40 years living in Leeds , that 's where he first came on record . Found homeless , living on the streets , at the age of 11 . 11 , bloody hell . No-one ever reported him missing . Apparently though , he did have a Scottish accent , back then . Gone now , but he was a long way lost . Can you remember the voice ? You said , " We are coming . " Can you remember why ? D 'you know what I think it was ? Aliens . There 's no such thing . Those days are gone . I don 't mean to scare you , because you 're perfectly safe , but I think aliens are using you to speak . What d 'you think ? No such thing . Isn 't it , isn 't it ? I 've met aliens . It 's part of my job . But I 'm not the authorities , or the police , or the army . So anything you say is just between me and you . And I will believe you . Give me your hand . You 're telling the truth . How can you tell ? I can smell it . You 've ... met them ? Dozens of them . Still not safe . Isn 't it , isn 't it ? They 're watching . Well , I can do something about that . Shh , shh . What 's that thing ? The technical name is a gizmo . Isn 't it ? I think you 've seen aliens too . What 's your name ? What 's your REAL name ? When did you last say your name ? Never . Then tell me . I was a kid . What happened ? They took us out . In the night . In the dark . Isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? They told us , they said we were going to a new home . Who did , who said ? The staff . A care home ? They drove us away for miles and miles . They were there . In the sky . What did they look like ? Light . The light ... .. took them . Took who ? My friends . But not you ? I ran . There was something , there was people , there was .. Isn 't it , isn 't it , isn 't it , isn 't it ? You 're all right , you 're safe . OK ? You 're safe now . But they 're coming back . I 've been smelling them for months . In the air . Long time coming . Tim , I can help . Look at me . I can help . If kids went missing , something 's got to be written down and I will find it . But to do that , I need to know your name . I was Clem . Clement MacDonald . Hi , Clem . Hi . Where were you from ? It was somewhere in Scotland , do you remember ? Holly Tree . Holly Tree , is that a town , or a place , or ... ? The Holly Tree . Is that where it happened ? Clem ? What was the Holly Tree ? What was the Holly Tree ? You 're pregnant . Sorry ? Yes , you are . No , I don 't think so . Yes . I can smell it . Three weeks . Oh ... Bloody hell , I 've been running . That camera 's gone off , it just went dead ! Still . No harm done , eh ? Everything all right ? Yes . I 'm fine , thank you . Right , well , I think you 've had long enough . Time for your meds , isn 't it , Tim ? If you don 't mind . No . Congratulations . Ianto , I need a search on Clement MacDonald , could be M-C or M-A-C , and try the words " Holly Tree " and Scotland . We 're looking at the 1960s , got that ? Yeah . Then try the words Timothy White , with the option of Timothy White 's , apostrophe S , like the shop . I lost the car . Yeah , and if you find anything , let me know , don 't wait for me to get back . Kids nicked it . Yeah , I 'll see you later . I 've got a red flag on a Torchwood intercept , the name Clement MacDonald , can you trace it ? Roger , Ashton , control initiating trace now . You 'll find the names under 456 . And what d 'you want me to do ? I promise , we can zap these kid 's memories so they won 't remember , no side effects . There 's been another death . Mr Chow Lee Jee , Chinese again . He came in with a nosebleed that wouldn 't stop . Next thing you know , it 's been diagnosed as a brain haemorrhage , he died at 16.25 . Sorry , he 's with me . Dr Patanjali , AE . We just need to check Mr Chow Lee Jee . Well , he hasn 't gone missing . I can see that . Need to run a toxicology scan . Not on the NHS , we 've got much better equipment . Pupil 's blown , that corresponds with a brain haemorrhage , though it could be induced artificially . No sign of trauma to the skin , apart from bruising , but ... Get them in . Seal off the area . The name Clement MacDonald hasn 't been active for 44 years , but here he is . Torchwood 's found him under the name of Timothy White . That 's way beyond coincidence . Bring him in . Who changed the plan ? I spent months researching that . And they believed me ! Perfect infiltration , I thought you wanted me inside Torchwood to see what they 've got in there . Who killed the Chinese man ? I did , I had to , it was perfect timing , he just fitted the story . Then get off your high horse , yeah ? Any sign yet ? Not so far . D 'you think it 's true ? What they say about him ? He was dead . Now he 's dead again . And we 'll keep killing him till he 's ready . Get him prepared . Yes , Ma 'am . How the hell does he do it ? No-one knows . Theory would suggest it 's connected to the Torchwood Hub . That Rift thing . Which makes the whole place a target . What changed the orders ? The children . Seal him up . Closing down . Everybody out ! Put him back where he was . He 'll wonder where I 've gone . How do we cover that ? How d 'you mean ? Well , he 's gonna try and trace me . You 're not disappearing . Yeah , but I 've got to , he 's gonna ... Sides ! Oh , no . Result ! There was a Holly Tree Lodge just outside Arbroath . It 's a hotel now , but , up until 1965 , it was a state-run orphanage . And they had a Clement MacDonald ! He was taken into care , April 1965 , after his mother died . No father on record . In November 1965 , he was transferred , along with ... Oh . Over to control . Harkness now approaching door one , over . He 's inside ! We don 't know how deep that place goes . Give it five . Over . We need damage control at St Helen 's . One body . Dr Rupesh Patanjali . Shot in the back . What happened ? I don 't know . He was just left there right beside me . Like someone 's gloating . Did they kill you ? Yeah . Maybe we 're being targeted . Whether it was him or me , we should be careful , better tell Gwen . She 's back , she 's in the lab . Gwen ! Boy , have I had a day . Oh , my God . Is that ... ? How long ? Three weeks . That 's good , isn 't it ? From where I 'm standing it ... looks good to me . Yeah . Bloody hell . It 's brilliant ! Ianto ! We 're having a baby ! Have you told Rhys ? I 've only just found out myself . Oh , you told me before you told him , he is gonna love that . Congratulations . Would now be a good time to tell you I lost the car ? You did what ? !

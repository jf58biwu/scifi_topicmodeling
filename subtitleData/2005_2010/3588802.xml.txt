 Previously on Heroes ... My life finally makes sense to me . In the last six weeks , I have saved 53 people . You can do this . You can give life . - Did you get his ability ? - Yeah . It 's time to take your life back , Emma . I used my ability to push one man 's memories into another man 's head , and now his consciousness is--is rattling around up in here . Someone 's done something to you , polluted your mind somehow . You would take me in here ? Knowing what I 've done , knowing who I am ? We 're family . Family accepts . Tonight , we welcome a new brother into our family . This is what we call a screaming scavenger hunt . You 're saying there 's another one of you here ? You think they 're trying to kill you ? Not me . Becky ? - What ? - What 's happening ? When we got here , Becky was all invisible , and that rod , like--like , went through your body , but it 's , like , you 're totally fine now . Seriously ? I just saw the two of you get attacked by a pack of wild dogs . Oh , my God . Those water bottles they gave us , I bet they were drugged . Yeah , I just saw you two making out . I think you 're right . Drugged . Oh , my God . Let 's just keep it between us , though . We don 't want the sisters to know that they got to us . Right . Exactly . See ? Problem solved . I thought our problem was a homicidal invisible girl . Are you okay ? No . Actually , I 'm not okay . Becky just tried to kill me . Eyewitnesses report that the two trains collided , causing the eastbound commuter to jump the track . W-w-w-what happened ? I was on the subway and then the train ... There was an accident . The train went off the tracks , okay ? I need you to do me a favor . I need you to wiggle your toes . Can you do that for me ? Yeah . How 's that ? It 's great . Try it for me one more time , huh ? Great . That 's perfect . You 're gonna be okay . - You all right ? - Yeah . You look exhausted . I 'm fine . Come on , let 's go . Now what have we got ? He 's gonna be okay . He 's a little shaken , but he 's gonna be fine . That 's the fourth patient that wasn 't as bad as we thought . We 've got luck on our side today . - Day 's not over yet . - Let 's go , people . We 've got more coming in . This day ain 't nearly close- - Attention , travelers . National Security Measures and the T.S.A. require you to keep your bags with you at all times . Unattended luggage will be confiscated immediately . Thank you for your cooperation . Tickets and I.D. , please . Thank you , next . Thank you , Mr. Parkman . Have a safe flight . I.D. out . Thank you . This is ridiculous . Just give me back my body . Sucks , doesn 't it ? Being in the passenger seat of your own life . Where the hell are we going , anyway ? New York . New York . What for ? The last thing I remember is Peter Petrelli stabbing me in the neck with a syringe . I figure the Italian eagle scout should know what happened next . Unless of course you want to save us the trouble and just tell me what happened to my body . That 's not gonna happen . Suit yourself . I don 't get to fly very often , you know ? Especially not first class . Well , I 'm glad my life savings could broaden your horizons . Code Blue . Gate 37 . Code Blue . This is not a drill . Hold the line . Hold the line . Hold it . What the hell 's going on ? Do not move . We found a gun in your bag . Ooh , they found a gun in your bag . What is he talking about ? Who are you talking to ? The socks you thought you were packing this morning ? My service revolver . There is no gun in that bag . You did not find a gun in that bag . Yes , we did . You might be able to control my body , but I will never ever let you control my ability . Do you hear me ? It sucks , doesn 't it ? This is a mistake . I can explain . I 'm a cop ! I 'm a cop ! Look , I can explain . No , I 'm a cop . I 'm a cop ! Final boarding call for flight ... I 'm sorry , Lydia . A situation 's come up . I don 't really have a choice in the matter . Made a bit of a mess . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to clean it up . A bit of a mess ? Sounds to me like the Claire Bennet recruitment is a lost cause . Well , you know me . I 'm the patron saint of lost causes . This is a lost cause . No . There 's got to be something . There 's nothing . Nothing about Becky Taylor , or why she wants me dead . Or why she killed Annie . Right . Let 's not forget that she already succeeded in killing one of your roommates . Awesome ! I should go to the sorority house and go into her room , go through her stuff . I 'll find answers there . What if you find Becky instead ? Or what if she 's here right now ? Wanting to kill me ... invisibly . Uh ... There are ways to make her visible . Huh ? See ? Nothing . Maybe I should go with you ? No . No , just stay here . It 'll be safer . And don 't let anyone in the room until I get back , okay ? Okay . You 'll be fine . Lock the door . Thank you . Do you work here ? Know how to keep pressure on a wound ? Do you know how to keep pressure on a wound ? Good . Now do not let up . Can you do that for me ? All right . If you see a nurse or a resident , you tell ' em that she 's prepped for a 4-0 Prolene suture ASAP , okay ? Thank you . Back on track . Thanks . If you are not essential personnel , find somewhere else to help . Pulse is 140 . His pressure is dropping . This one 's critical . Come on . Move it , people . Out of the way . What 's the situation ? Isn 't this a little backwards ? So where 's his chart ? We 'll check his chart after we save him . What is this ? A parade route ? Come on , people . Don 't crowd me . You understand the meaning of " seriously injured " ? 'Cause I can happen to give you a hands-on example . If an old lady like me can move her ass , I 'm sure you can too . There you go . That 's what I 'm talking about . Nice job , guys . Thank you . Watch the glass . Watch the glass ! Why would I want to be dressed as a pirate ? Because everyone will be dressed as wenches , and you won 't stand out . And don 't worry . You can totally be a slutty pirate . Ooh . - Oh , hey , Claire . - Hey . Uh , a little late for party prep , aren 't we ? Have you guys seen Becky since she kidnapped us ? - Since she what ? - Since she kidnapped us . For the scavenger hunt . Oh , there 's gonna be a scavenger hunt ? You guys don 't remember anything . - Huh ? - Okay , um ... That was fast . My daughter calls , I drop everything . I mean , the luck we 're having today , huh ? Wow , four and a half hours at the airport , trying to talk your way out of that airport jail , only to still be on the no-fly list . And now this . How did I not see that huge chunk of metal in the middle of the road ? Maybe I made it so you didn 't see it . Oh , man , I could get used to this- - Playing the bad guy , the saboteur . Do you have any upper-body strength at all ? Actually , I 'm deceptively strong . Strong enough to stop your ass from getting to New York . Yeah , I don 't think so , Matt . I 'm in control . You sure about that ? You okay , son ? Yeah , I 'm fine . My car , not so much . Well , there 's a trick to loosening the stubborn bolts . - Want me to give it a go ? - Be my guest . I 'd appreciate that , Mr. , uh ... Hank . Ain 't nothin ' . Can you hand me that tire iron over there , please ? Sure thing , Hank . You okay over there ? That looked like that could have hurt . No , I 'm fine . You know , it looks like it 's going to be a long trip to New York . What ? Oh , what are you gonna do ? - You gonna hit me ? - No . Hey , Hank . Yeah ? Hey . Hey ! Whoo ! You 're right . Deceptively strong . You- - You just killed him . No , I didn 't . You did . Okay , let 's go over the rules . I 'm pretty clear from our phone conversation what the rules are . Well , recap for me . We make all the bad stuff go away , like this Becky ... Man on the floor . And you get to keep all the good stuff , like your new friend Gretchen . Am I right ? Close enough . I will do my best , Claire , but life isn 't always that simple . Let me get inside the room and see what I can find . It 's that one on the end . Okay . All right , Claire , why don 't you go on back to the dorm , back to your friend ? I 'm coming with you , Claire . What ? No . No , no , no . We just went over the rules . Don 't you remember what the rules are ? You are not supposed to wipe Gretchen 's memory . She must be a really good friend . Dad , just--please . He 's not going to erase Gretchen 's memory . He 's going with you so that if Becky comes near , she won 't be able to stay invisible . Okay ? Oh . That 's actually a really good plan . This is not my first rodeo . Thanks , Dad . We 'll regroup soon . Come on , Rene . He was helping you . Exactly . In his death , he has helped me prove a point about the line . What line ? The one I can cross and you can 't . The one that says I can do anything I want , like killing people in cold blood . No , you can 't just- - The world is my hostage , Matt . Anybody . Anytime . So no more sabotage , okay ? Because I 'm the one that 's in control here . Do you understand me ? I 'm sorry . I don 't think I heard you . Yes . I understand you . Good . Hey . I 'm ... fine . I 'm fine . I can 't ... Too many people need help . This power , it keeps draining out of me , and then it comes back , and then it drains out of me again . Maybe you shouldn 't use it anymore . And be ordinary ? I got to get back in there . Thanks . Hey , you know , they could use your help . Earlier , I saw you with the , uh , suture . Where 'd you learn how to do that ? Clown College . Clown College . Seriously . Medical school . I dropped out . You 're packing . Why are you packing ? Because I 'm going home . Maybe forever . No . No , no , no , no . You can 't do that . I told you that I was gonna handle it . With what ? Baby powder ? That doesn 't exactly inspire confidence . I know . I know . And that 's why I called my dad . You 're too important ... to me . I just don 't want to lose you . I 'm sorry . I already booked my flight . Wait , wait , wait . You don 't understand , okay ? This is Rene , and he can keep Becky from being able to turn invisible . I 'm scared for my life , okay ? - I know . - Do you ? Because Becky 's after me . She 's not after you , because you can 't get hurt . But I can . Gretchen . Gretchen , everything 's gonna be fine . Okay ? My dad and I have done this a thousand times . Exactly ! This is everyday life for you , but it 's not for me . I 'm just not like you . Stay with her , please , until she gets on the plane . Can I help you ? Possibly . Hopefully . I apologize for this awkward introduction ... and my more awkward agenda . My name is Samuel , and I 'm here looking for my niece , Rebecca . Becky . And why would I know where your niece is ? Because she told me who you are , Claire . At least a little bit . I know you 're special . Like her . Like me . I know you 're asking yourself right about now , " Who is this guy ? What could he possibly know about me ? " Yeah , something like that . I also know it 's very hard to trust anyone in this world being ... one of us . - So why should I trust you ? - You shouldn 't . Not until you hear me out . If you have a moment to listen , I might have some answers for you . I had a partner like you once . As I recall , about 10,000 volts of electricity should make you materialize ... And then some . Don 't want to have to use this . Why do I find that hard to believe ? Just you today ? I 'm actually hungry enough to eat for two . If memory serves , the Tahitian pancakes here are really good . And a coke . Uh , a diet coke . Oh , I 'd say go for the real thing . Life 's too short for artificial sweeteners . Well , amen to that ... Lynette . Regular coke it is . Yeah . Oh , she 's so sweet . Isn 't Lynette so sweet ? Funny story ... I tried to kill a waitress here once . - You can 't kill her . - Oh , I 'm sorry . Did you miss my whole " the world is my hostage " bit earlier ? No , I got it . I got it . I 've done nothing . And I 've kept quiet . And now I want you to talk . Hostages are used to get things that you want , and I want to know everything- - Exactly how I ended up in your head , and where the hell my body is . No . It 's nice and isolated back there . Nobody 'd ever hear her scream . Come on . Stop . Please . Come on . Stop it . Okay , fine . Just tell me what I want to know . Your choice . Her life is in your hands . Do you need something , sweetheart ? As a matter of fact , I do . All right . Fine , fine . I will tell you anything you want to know . Thank you very much . So you can move the earth ? Something like that . We 're all like you . A family of sorts . People with extraordinary abilities . Rebecca came to us when she was still very young . So she 's not really your niece ? A family is more than blood . It 's about trust , about love . About those who embrace you . The real you . Unconditionally . Becky pushed my roommate out the window . Do you embrace that ? No , of course not . But Rebecca 's complicated . Her father was murdered when she was just five years old . Okay , but how is that my fault ? It 's not . You 're not the one she 's after . It 's all about you . I 'm sorry . Do I know you ? You don 't remember me at all ? Well , I guess you wouldn 't . You never saw me . But I remember you . I was five when you came to my house , when you tried to take me and my dad away . He told me to stay out of sight . Shh . I had never seen him so scared . And then in came my dad ? Shooting first , asking questions later . Well , I 'm sure he had a good reason . The reason is we were different . Potentially dangerous . Your father needed neither warrant nor probable cause . Not for people like us . Life is more complicated . I hid under the bed and I wished ... Wished that you wouldn 't find me . And my wish came true . You didn 't see me . Your ability manifested . I kept making wishes , that that whole night had never happened , for my dad to come back . I have spent my entire life wondering why I could make a wish and save myself , but not him . I thought perhaps Becky had moved past it , but ... She came to get revenge on him . Through you . And then when I found out that you had a daughter , I stopped making wishes and I made a promise . I 'm gonna take away all of the dreams that you had for her just like you did to me . I 'm sorry about your father . I take responsibility for that . But you 're not going to hurt my daughter . I 'm gonna hurt you both . Becky , I picked up your costume . Oh , um , hi . What are you doing in here ? Just , um , looking for someone . I guess she 's gone . Excuse me . I am truly sorry for what happened to your roommate . Both of them . But it was good of you to send the other away . I didn 't send her away . She left . Well , it 's a slanted perspective to see the extraordinary through ordinary eyes . Fear is easier than understanding . So how do you deal with it ? By not having to deal with it . I simply surrounded myself with people who , by definition , are like me . It 's a whole lot easier for someone like you to understand you . Which is why I came to you and not your father . We both know exactly what he would do in this situation . No , tell me . What would Bennet do ? I don 't mean you any harm . I swear . He said he was Becky 's uncle . You were stalling . You kept me talking . You seem to like to talk . You actually think that I would trust you over my dad ? I just ran into your niece . She 's , um , not all there , is she ? Rebecca 's a very disturbed girl . But in all fairness , you had a hand in that . A responsibility . Okay , let 's talk responsibility . What do you know about this ? What is that ? Every time I see that compass , it comes with a dead body . First was Danko 's . Agent Danko killed my brother . He started all this . We didn 't want any bloodshed . Well , you forgot to tell that to your knife-wielding friend who sliced my guts open . In the wrong hands , this compass could mean trouble for my family . We just need to stay hidden . - From who ? - Well , for starters , you . No offense , sir , but you have a reputation for scorching earth to get to people like me . Please , I just need to find Rebecca and get her some help . And I want some answers . Help ! Somebody help ! - She 's not breathing . - Let 's get her to the E.R. No time . It 's a pneumothorax . I can do this . Thoracotomy kit . Okay . Take over . Hey . Hey , sweetheart . You 're gonna be okay , all right ? You 're gonna be okay . You did it . You really should watch how you treat us in front of your daughter . After all , she 's like me . You really ought to watch what you say to my daughter . Don 't blame your father . He really doesn 't understand us . Get in the car . Rebecca , no ! No , come on . Dad , don 't ! Look out ! Dad , no ! I 'm so sorry . You all right ? I 'm sorry . Okay , here 's the truth . After Peter took you down , I pushed Nathan 's memories into your mind . I made your body think that it was him . Your shape-shifting took care of the rest . I had never done this before . I thought that I was pushing all of Sylar out of that body . I didn 't- - I had no idea that all of it would stay with me . Well , that 's just crazy . Just the check , please , Lynette . Thank you . Clearly you didn 't decide to do this on your own . Who else was involved ? Mama Petrelli , right ? Who else ? Bennet . Everyone else thinks you 're dead . Well ... I was off to see the wrong brother . I got to go find Nathan . Get my body back . Then what are you gonna do ? Then I 'm gonna kill ... every single person , even remotely involved . You should really pay more attention to what you 're doodling - on a napkin . - Hands up ! Police . Freeze . What the hell are you doing ? I 'm crossing that line . You told me that I 'm not man enough to take a life . Well , you know what ? You 're wrong . 'Cause I 'm gonna take yours . You 're an idiot . You 'll die with me . Yeah . I know . Gun ! I 'm sorry I pushed you . It 's okay . I don 't bruise easy . No , you don 't , do you ? Hey . You 're amazing . You know that ? Think you mean extraordinary . I want you to have everything . You deserve it . A social life . The education . The white picket fence . All of it . Well , as you said , sometimes life just isn 't that simple . Good night . Night , Claire Bear . Who 's that ? My nephew , Christopher . He drowned . I was babysitting , and ... I got distracted for a moment . I didn 't hear him . I tried to revive him . It was right before my second year of residency . That 's why you dropped out . Yeah . Megan wanted you to have that . She said it 's only for very special people . Special . I couldn 't save him . But you saved her . You saved me . Thank you . Are you gonna go back to school ? Go be a doctor ? Can you see the colors ? No . I don 't have that power anymore . But we could still play , if you like . Still asystolic . All right . 360 . Clear . I 'm sorry I had to do that to you . I 'm sorry that I messed things up with Claire . I just ... Got impatient . Sloppy . Don 't worry . Might not have been the plan as conceived , but I think Claire Bennet 's right where we want her to be . Look , when I asked you to do this , I promised you revenge , and you 'll still have it . Uh , we have a problem . - A big problem . - What ? Sylar , he 's gone . Nathan , what are you--what--what ? - Oh , thank God . - What are you doing ? What 's going on ? I think I 'm in trouble , Pete .

 Who 's this ? Louisa Raposa , their spokesperson . Two sets of doctors said our illness had nothing to do with Iraq . One hired by Battle Support , one by the Pentagon . - Welcome to Canada . - Thank you . So we spent a week loading out these bombed out buildings , even the dirt under them , into these big biohazard barrels . What was in the buildings ? Iraqi military supplies . They wouldn 't tell us more . Now ten of us are fucking dying . They weren 't exposed to anything . They were using state-of-the-art hazmat gear . - There 's no tank ? - No . Why wouldn 't they send a tank ? I mean , maybe that 's what infected them . This is the military . The air tanks are collecting the workers ' moisture . It 's about the water . From a big machine on the back of a truck . It was called something funny , it was like ... a Reimer . I have a dozen sick people , and a team of scientists who say that the most probable cause is a Reimer . I 've been offered a senior position in another lab . Oh . That 's ... that 's great , Bob . I 'm leaving , Jill . Bye . I think I see where Jill went wrong . Well , listen , if she calls , don 't tell her anything . But this is my last day . 1x10 - The Source That was Jersey , I 'll pay you back . Oh , don 't worry about it . It 's too bad you don 't play the flute . So , who were you talking to ? My husband . - Are you ... happily married ? - Very . Good . Lucky ... lucky guy . You pussy . It was my mother . Don 't do that . Come over here , you . Ooh , aye-aye-aye . Hey ! Any word from Jill and Carlos on the SACS outbreak ? Their plan landed in Campeche , they 're on the way to a temporary lab . Good . - Did somebody 's gerbil die ? - Bob . Bob had a gerbil ? - Bob 's not here . - His stuff 's gone . Well , he actually left ? Well , he 's gone , David . No . Guys with Asperger 's , they can barely change their socks , let alone their jobs , so there 's no way ... I 'll call him . That 's a nice shirt , but ... - Ah , his phone must have ... - Call him at home . He doesn 't have a home phone . Gamelan chews it when it rings or something . From Washington , the Reimer . Oh , looks like you 're going to need a new biochemist , David . You know , we do have 2 other biochemists . - Yeah , but not Bob ! - With Jill and Carlos in Mexico , we 're already short-staffed . Don 't worry , okay . Bob is like a homing pigeon , he always comes back ... I didn 't mean it to sound that way . You know what ? I 'm going to go to my office , now . I 'll just leave that here . He 'll be back , he 'll be back . Caroline , where would you like me to set this up ? Over here . Ooh , that 's Doctor Valada . In the ... In the truck . Shit ! He said that they took him to another hospital because there 's no blood left here . Jesus ! Hi . Carlos Serrano ... - Oh , Alejandro Malavilla . - Hol√† Alejandro , mucho gusto . Jill Langston . I 'm just going to check and make sure his stuff 's not all broken . Okay . Beavers have no exterior sexual organs , but they do have castor oil glands , which is where many perfumes get their scent . People in the Middle Ages thought that these glands were testicles and that when the beaver was being chassed by hunters , in order to escape , it would bite off its own testicles and throw them at the hunters . Castor , castrate , get it ? Yeah . Tell you what , Bob you , huh ... You come back to the lab and you can tell me the whole megillah , hmm ? Well ... I huh ... I have another lab . Bob , it 's a cosmetics factory . It 's a laboratory of the olfactory sciences . We 've got a Reimer . Really ? It 's amazing . No bigger than a bar fridge . Turns salt water , human waste , anything into pure drinking water . Except it has a flaw . Exactly . So we 've got to take it apart , figure out what poisoned Louisa and her gang . And nobody can figure it out : US military , private companies , NASA , nada . Sounds fascinating . But I 've moved on . Professionally and emotionally . Bob , how long have we known each other ? Like ... Ten years , 5 months , 4 days . Right . So , you just tell me what you need to hear . Whatever it takes , you 're coming home to NorBAC . That 's what you said the last time . Remember ? The last what time ? When you had your first lab and you couldn 't afford to pay me for 6 months . " Whatever it takes , Bob , I want you to stay . " So I started moonlighting for Miss Richmond . Yeah , and you were supposed to quit when we got the NorBAC gig . Miss Richmond has always encouraged my passion for perfumes . Let me get this straight . I 'm understaffed , I 'm overworked , I 'm dealing with cutting edge technology , but you 'd rather be out there making women smell better with beaver balls ? - There , you did it again . - What ? You never listen . Jesus Christ , Bob ! What are you , my fucking wife ? I told you . Not balls , glands . Fucking hell . Hey , how 's it going ? You really should have a biochemist or a microbiologist on this . Well , one of them in Mexico and the other one 's on Venus . Did you give the analysis of the nano filter material to Genwen like I told you ? Yes . He 's slow . He 's methodical . What 'd you get ? It 's fabulous . Lead , arsenic , chromium , radioactive metals . All removed at rates of 99.999 % . Do you want me to call Bob or should Caroline ? We will get a replacement . Right . Is there a senior biochemist anywhere who 's still talking to you ? David ! Jill 's on line 4 . Thank you , Weston , your timing 's impeccable . Yeah ? David , everything 's come up negative . I can 't find anything that remotely looks like a virus or a bacterium . What about epidemiology ? Well , it 's difficult to correlate . None of the victims have any obvious factors in common that would point to a mode of transmission . Not even food ? Well , that looked good until we came upon number 6 , who 's a hermit , completely isolated . Even grew his own food . He bled to death when he lost a tooth . Well , I guess that leaves you with 2 strong candidates : Airborne or waterborne . Yeah , Doctor Valada has pretty much covered both those theories . I wouldn 't trust anybody 's research on this . Okay . We 'll get on it . David , has Bob said anything about my experiment ? Bob ? Yeah ! He says it 's huh ... He says it 's going well . Listen , Mayko needs me , I 've got to go . Oh ... okay . What 's wrong ? Bye . You didn 't hear ? Bob found out where Jill went wrong . - Shit . She made a mistake ? - Yep . Ooh , she 'll go nuts . Yep . All right . Where 's Bob ? The red Xs show deaths , the Os , recoveries . - Does it have the latest victims ? - As of midnight last night . Now , these are wind charts , but I couldn 't get accurate recent statistics . Why ? Hum ... Because the man who runs the weather station here was victim 2 . So , the arrows indicate historic wind speed and direction patterns for this time of year , the larger the arrow , the stronger the wind . It does not explain the dissemination of the outbreak . Did you try running any dynamic analysis ? Enviro protocols , all came up negative . So then , we 're left with water . Which leaves us nowhere , because ... Jill ? Can you ... Can you show me that previous page , please ? - With the wind ? - Yes . This is not what happened . We had lots of hot winds coming from the south in the last few weeks . It 's very unusual . So ? This Reimer is incredible . Shit . Look . Jesus , the fluorite 's like a 1000 times greater than ultra porous membranes . I want one of these in my apartment . What do have left to look at ? The analysis of the nano filter material . - Where is Genwen ? - Being methodical . You might as well warn Louisa that things are looking bad . Me ? You 're the one who brought her here . You 're the one who 's fucking her . Hey ! David , any progress ? Thank you . Yeah , check this out . Okay . Thirsty ? What did you pour into it at the front end ? We want to see if you can tell the difference . Between ? - My piss and Mayko 's . - Oh , Jesus ! Definitely Mayko 's . How does it work ? All right . Reimer uses this pretty amazing nano particle filtration system , right ? Nano particle ? As in a nanometre wide . One billionth of a metre . Right . So you put like , polluted water , sweat , piss , whatever , through it and ... the cleanest water you 'll ever drink . Is there anything that could get through ? - Some minute trace elements . - And that couldn 't hurt me ? No , your body 's natural defences will take care of whatever gets through . You 've got to love American know-how . Especially when it 's based on Soviet technology . So this suit , the Reimer , they did what they were supposed to do ? As far as we can tell , yeah . Unless we 're missing something , a nano chemical , a nano virus . A good biochemist might be helpful . Bob doesn 't work here anymore , Mayko . It 's a shame . I hate to think we 're missing something . You 'd better start thinking about getting down to Mexico . Right . Fine . This is the updated wind pattern matrix . So you were right , Alejandro . Winds from the south , but what 's down there ? - It 's very remote . - This isn 't ? More remote . Very few people live there . No farming . Industry ? No . - Military ? - No . Nothing . Nothing at all . Except the Yankees . Hey , there ! Whoo ! Thanks . Hey . Hi . - Welcome to Phat Phoods . - Hi , Carlos- - - I 'm Angela Rover . - Carlos Serrano . Hi . Jill Langston with NorBAC . Awesome . Very interesting set up you have here . Oh , thanks , yeah . A bunch of us were doing our PhD 's at Bryce , doing our pharmacology , biotech , botany , nutrition . How we met actually playing ultimate Frisbee . But nobody wanted to work for corporate jobs , so we started our own . So you 're going to keep all those millions for yourselves ? No . No . These crops are not designed to make millions , just to help millions . And there 's nothing wrong with biotechnology , just something wrong in how it 's exploited . Angela , who funds you ? We went to the Silicon Valley . Left a week later with $ 20 million in start up . So , we moved here to work and live cheaply . What are your test crops ? We 've got some bananas that lower cholesterol , we 've got some high-protein rice , hypoallergenic peanuts . So far it 's a peanut that everybody 's allergic to . Here 's something interesting . This is a mustard we 're developing . Grows just about anywhere and we 're hoping we can seed it using crop plants . And what 's so special about it ? Well , there are a hundred million unexploded land mines in the world that are killing and maiming an average of- 26,000 people every year , yeah . - Yeah . That 's right . So , what we 've done is we 've genetically modified this mustard so that if it comes in contact with a buried land mine , it turns red not green . - That 's incredible ! - I know . - Have you written this up ? - No , not yet . We 've got a ways to go , so ... And what are those ? Okay , this is our crass commercial crop . Just something to make some funds . It 's onions that don 't make you cry . - Oh . Any luck ? - Yeah , we 're getting there . You know , we used to think that the cry factor was part of the aroma flavour biochemistry and that the tears were a by-product . But in fact , the release of the cry factor is just to ward off predators . So , an onion 's like a skunk ? Yeah , kind of . Fantastic . So , can we get samples ? - Yeah , sure . Even of the onions ? - Everything . Hey , you don 't think they 're causing the anticoagulation syndrome , do you ? - Let 's be sure . - All right . Come this way . The lab totally sucks without you , Bob . That 's nice . - We need you . David needs you . - No , he doesn 't . Yes , he does . Look , your brain is so stuffed with ideas ... A lot of it 's misfiled . You go places his brain doesn 't go . Unusual solutions . Well , let 's face it , your mind works differently . Why are these so painful to open ? So , you had a question ? I guess it 's ... What ... What are we missing ? Nothing gets through ? - 1 in a million parts . - That 's not enough to make you sick . No , it 's too diluted , right ? I mean , and we can 't find anything that wouldn 't get knocked-out by your body 's defences . What about something your body wouldn 't recognize ? It wouldn 't knock that out . Like what ? I don 't know . An impostor . A Trojan horse ? I don 't know what you 're talking about , Bob . I don 't know either . Hmm . That 's lunch . I 've got to go . Bob , think about it . Thanks , Mayko . Oh , say hi to everyone at the lab . Bye . So , that 's it ? We 're all paranoid hypochondriacs ? A bunch of rip-off artists ? Nobody said that . Yes , they did . Right to my face . It wasn 't us . You know . When Mayko introduced you as Dr. David Sandstrom , I said to myself : " Another fucking doctor ! " I 'm a doctor that fucks , but I 'm not a fucking doctor . Oh , yes , you are . I mean , you don 't got the penthouse and the Mercedes . You 've got that " even my shit 's holy " attitude . Louisa , I am not talking about what happened , I 'm talking about what we can prove . Well , if you can 't prove what happened then you suck . And now , you 're just ... You 're leaving , you 're running off to Mexico . There 's been an outbreak , okay ! People are dying . God damn it ! People are dying right here , David ! All right , what is it ? What happened ? Rita , uh ... She died this morning . She 's got kids , man . No history of the disease . Me neither . I 'm going to need a mastectomy . Double for me . No , just don 't . - Come here . - No ! You know what ? - Louisa ... - No . Louisa , Louisa , Louisa . I 'm sorry . Hey ... I 'm sorry . Smells like Indian food . Definitely Southern . - Hi , David . - Bob ? What are you doing here ? - I thought I was invited for dinner . - Of course you were , Bob . Oh , yeah . Right , yeah . Absolutely . Okay , get in here , Bob . Huh ... Louisa , Bob Melnikov , formerly of my lab . Louisa Raposa . - Hi , Bob . - Hi , Louisa . This is Gamelan . Hi , Gamelan . - Indian food . Coincidence . - Why ? - You remember E.H. Hankin ? - Yeah . In 1896 , he was the one who discovered that the River Ganges , an open sewer , really did have magical powers when you drank it , but when you boiled the water to kill the germs , it lost it 's magical powers . Why ? Cholera . People had cholera and there was something in the Ganges that when you drank it , it killed the spread of the cholera bacteria . What was it ? - Bacteria phages . - Sorry , what ? Bacteria phages . Viruses that infect bacteria . Where are you going with this , Bob ? Well , I was thinking DNA transfer . Unrecognized bacteria , no immune response . Holy shit ! Wait , what are we talking about ? Well , okay , let 's say you know you 've got some nasty bacteria in the salt marshes in Iraq , so you 're going to want to run this through a filtration system - like the Reimer , right ? - Yeah , they did that . But wouldn 't the filtration system keep the bacteria from getting through ? All but 10 in a million , as we 've discovered . Right , and that 's nothing for your body 's natural immune system to take care of . That 's why people have been calling you a paranoid hypochondriac . But , if those 10 little bacteria got infected with bacteria phages , that 's all it would take . Isn 't it , Bob ? - That 's my theory . - What theory ? It 's not the bacteria , it 's the bacteria phages infecting the bacteria , that 's the problem . Check it out . Let 's say this is one of the nasty bacteria that managed to miraculously get through the Reimer unscathed , okay . All by itself , not a problem . One would think , except , it 's been infected with a bacteria phage , which is a virus . So , it multiplies and pretty soon , 1 becomes a million and eventually they bust out . Now , here 's the thing . Some bacteria phages can carry DNA . So , when they all explode out of the cell , and remember , there 's millions of them , they could be carrying toxic genes that they 've picked up from the nasty bacteria . Toxic genes attack internal organs . They can develop cancer cells , they can do anything . Bob , you 're a genius . Only if we can prove that that 's what happened to Louisa and her friends . Otherwise , I 'm still just Bob . No , Bob , you 're a genius . Thank you , David . Do you think this could be it ? It 's a way . It may be the only way that would explain how this ship from the marshes in Iraq managed to find a home inside you . Hey , food 's here guys , if you 're hungry . - Sorry ? What ? - No , he 's not hungry . He 's not hungry ? - Smells good . - Yeah . I don 't even know what I have here , there was no menu . She just sort of told me what I should eat . Let 's see what we 've got . Ah , this is pampana in salsa verde ... - Fish ? - Muy bien . Hmm , very good . - Ooh . Is that cocinita pibil ? - I have no idea . - You have to try that , it 's very good . - Okay . Ave Maria purisima . Are those papasules ? I don 't know . Jill , you have to try that , that 's like the best thing . Forget the pibil . Okay . Jill , Jill , try one of those , they 're great . - Okay . Do you want one ? - Sure . I 'll take a bite . So , it looks like they 've inserted a genetic splice into the mustard that causes it to react to the nitric oxides that leak out of the explosives into the soil . It might affect nitric oxide in your body . - No , the genetic splice ... - Not this , okay . No . And nitric oxide levels inhibit blood clots . That 's delicious . Results just came in from Berkley and they genotyped it . So , from left to right . New samples , archival water from the UN , and one we found in Louisa 's blood . Similar but different . All right , let 's look specifically for virulence genes . Bob ? I 'm on it . Hi Bob , nice to have you back . Oh , thanks Wes , but it 's just temporary . Sure . - You off ? - Yeah . Yeah . - David , it 's Carlos . - Hey . So , we thought we had the critical link , this GMO mustard , but our test didn 't hold up . - I can 't hear you very well . - What ? - What was the problem ? - The problem is that we were wrong . Nothing in the genetically-altered plant could cause the magnitude of the disorder showing up in the victims . Have you got an alternative hypothesis ? None . - Make one up . - Believe me , I 'm trying David . Look , when can you get down here ? I 'm on a flight tomorrow . I want to finish up with this Reimer thing first . - Oh , you got something ? - We 're close . Let me speak to Jill . Huh , she 's indisposed . - Meaning ? - She 's in the servicios . The toilet , the loo , the W-C . Ah , well , don 't give up . - See you tomorrow . - Okay . Bring toilet paper . The softer , the better . I use a bidet . - ... temporary . - Sure . - You off ? - Yeah , see you . I can be at the gym in like , 20 minutes . Want to get some Korean afterwards ? Just hold on a second . Crap . Yeah , I , uh ... I 'll see you there . All right , Manny , great . How are you doing ? - What are you doing here , Elliott ? - Yeah , nice to see you too . - Is there somewhere we can go and talk ? - I 've got nothing to say . Look , I just drove 12 hours to get here . The least you can do is have a drink with me . Are you drinking again , Elliott ? I guess this born again thing is working out about as well as - all your other endeavours , huh ? - I was thinking coffee . Sorry , I 've got plans . Oh yeah ? Where are you prancing off to ? You 've got some cock to suck ? Fuck you ! Grow up , Elliott ! Hey , it 's all right . Fuck ! I 'm out of here . Just escort him , please . Wes , are you okay ? Who was that ? My brother . Nice . Well , don 't give up . See you tomorrow . I use a bidet . Elliott never had much time for Aunt Rose . A couple of years ago , he found Jesus . Beating up one 's brother doesn 't seem very Christian . Rose had a stroke 3 years ago and I had to put her into this healthcare facility . But she made me the power of attorney so that I could manage her estate . Big estate ? She had stocks and uh ... A great house in West Palm Beach which she doesn 't want to give up . Some land in Montana that she ain 't going to sell that 's about worth 3 million dollars . And you get it all when she dies ? No . No , both of us , actually . It 's like ... We 're all that she has left but she 's going to be around for a long , long time . And your brother wants his share now ? Yeah . That 's all I talked about the last two years . You going to be okay ? Thank you . So , a few bacteria phages from the Iraqi marshes got through the Reimer 's filter ? That 's right . Enough to cause breast cancer , kidney failure , fibromyalgia ? Well , bacteria phages amplify themselves and as they do this , they infect your natural bacteria with new genetic material , okay ? So this could cause the good bacteria to mutate and start secreting toxins which causes everything from cancer to organ failure . But from the outside , they still look like your friendly neighbourhood bacteria . Bob 's idea , Trojan horse . And now , the toxins are out there and they 're able to spread to every corner of your body . Which is why they cause so many different illnesses . - Why didn 't ' everyone get sick ? - Exactly . We need to find out if the immune systems of the healthy ones were able to conquer any mutating bacteria or if they just became carriers , spreading it without even realising it . We need our chief virologist to figure that part out . Which is why , Jill , you 're on the next plane up . David will take your place in Mexico . That 's fine with me . How soon do you want me back there ? I 'm on the next flight down . Oh , good ! I 'll wave at you as our planes pass over Chicago . Carlos , you still there ? Hey . I 'm not going anywhere . Someone has to keep you out of trouble . Adios , amigo . Mayko is going to put everything we found out in a great big , fat file , full of colour pictures and graphs and diagrams and the resumes of everybody who works at the lab . With that , you should be able to get a lawyer anywhere to take your case . Yeah , well , you know , I can see it now , man . The suit manufacturers will blame the canister . The canister people will blame the Reimer . The Reimer people will blame the contractors and the contractors will blame the army , who will blame the suit . - See what I 'm saying ? - You knew all that going in . Oh no , no . I learned that along the way . But once I start there 's no stopping me . Well , you 'll get justice , eventually . Yeah , but the lawyers pocket most of the money . Hey , come over here . I got you . What about you , you motherfucker ? You 're leaving me . Stay . I 'll be back soon . Or come with me . I got to go home to Jersey . I got to get this lawsuit going . I got to get on with my life . Thanks . Bienvenido √† Mexico , Senior Sandstrom . Oh , necessita una cerveca ! That 's necessito . It 's necessita . For a guy , necessito . Just give me a fucking beer . I got it . I got it . We 've had 3 deaths since we 've been here , but that 's only because the Mexican military has half the army shuttling people to the hospitals . There 's no let up in cases . How many ? 125 a week , with blood transfusions they all seem to recover . I still think the altered mustard is a good candidate . It 's not airborne , David . Yeah , I know , but I 'm thinking maybe the ground water got polluted with the nitric oxide . A long shot . And you know what , I 'm running out of other ideas . Well , let 's go to the reservoir and get some water samples , huh ? What reservoir ? The one we 're going to find . Oh , fuck ! You sure you don 't want some netting ? I have it in the Jeep . No , no ! I 'm fine . What 's going on with Jill 's experiment ? Bob sent me an e-mail , said it was all screwed up . You know , when I was teaching grad students , I told them All mistakes are not created equal , and the earlier you make a mistake , the farther off course you 're going to end up . So , you 've got to be diligent so your mistakes can be postponed . Hopefully to another lifetime . You told Jill ? Not yet . What are you waiting for ? I 'm hoping to postpone it to another lifetime . Oh ! Fuck ! Hey ! We 're dealing with an acute anticoagulation pathology here , right ? Yeah . Mosquitoes can cause anticoagulation . David , do you realise how much anticoagulant you would need to reach the levels we 've been monitoring in the victims ? You would need millions and millions of bites . I feel like I have a million . Fuck off ! What if we 're dealing with a bunch of mosquitoes that flew too close to a nuclear power station and got radioactively-enhanced super mosquito powers , eh ? Well , there goes that theory . Okay , results . Whose dumb idea was that ? What do you know about mosquito genes ? Which one ? They have about 14,000 of them . Seems to me we 're missing the obvious . I mean , mosquitoes use an anticoagulant to keep your blood from clotting while they take it . There 's this GMO facility in the neighbourhood with god-knows-what kind of crazy genes floating around inside . Who 's to say there aren 't a couple of super mosquitoes flying around out there ? We would have to test a million mosquitoes . We could offer a peso per mosquito . How about a beer for a bottleful ? Hey , Elliott , it 's me . I think we should talk . - Wes ... - Just hold on a second , please . Hi , these are the receipts for our flight , hotels , some food , but most of it went in the garbage . Just fill in the receipt forms , photocopy it and then file them on Monday . Come on , be a pal ? Bye . Sorry about that . I really think we should . Because we should , come on ... Oh , hi Jill . Did David tell you where I think you made the mistake in your experiment ? " It 's pretty simple , really . " It turns out the cells you used was never the immediate transcription response ... " I 'm sorry , we all make mistakes . Carlos , come take a look at this . The results just came in from Berkley . What the hell caused that ? Water pollution ? No , don 't say air pollution either . Right there . I see an anomaly but ... That has been genetically engineered . What ? No . No . Maybe something jumped the species barrier ... It 's man-made . No . The sequence shows there 's a malinari element on some plasma DNA . It 's going to take us forever to figure it out down here . We 're going to have to get this mosquito flown back to Bob . Okay . Well , you think globally , I will shop locally . All right . So , this is what you call middle class living ? Sit down , Elliott . What 's this proposition that you want to put out there ? The way I see it , this is fair . Every time that you 've gotten into trouble , I 've been there for you . When you lost your job , when you were trying to go dry , both times , I was there . Yeah . That 's the old Elliott . When it was time to move Rose from her house to the home , I 'm the one that helped her pack , I moved her , I visited her ... I was going through a divorce , Wes . This is my proposal . I want to give you $ 100,000 out of my pocket . That 's all I have to give . But when Rose dies , I want to keep the house . That 's fucking bullshit ! The house is worth 10 times that much . We 'll still be splitting the estate . Elliott , you 'll get a fair share . I 've been gambling . Jesus Christ ! I owe money , Wes . I owe a lot of money . That 's all I have to offer , man . Well , sell the fucking house in Florida . Rose isn 't going to sell it . You make her sell it , you god damn ... faggot . Your co-workers know you 're a fag ? - I 'm not gay , Elliott . - Fuck off , you 've got AIDS , don 't you ? I 've got HIV . I got it from a prostitute in Prague . She was so fucking beautiful , man . For 10 extra bucks , I didn 't even have to use a condom . See ? Stupidity runs in our family . I don 't believe you , Wes . I don 't give a fuck what you believe . Go . No . No one is doing GMO work with mosquitoes in Mexico but ... Yeah ? It 's Mayko . Oh , hey Mayko . I 'm going to put you on speaker . Hey , Mayko . How 's it going up there ? Bob 's doing the PCR of the mosquito splice . Anyway , people in the French-language chatroom say there 's a Belgian biotech doing research on mosquitoes . Where ? - No one knows . - Mosquitoes and what ? Couldn 't find out . Well , how do they know ? This guy went out with a woman who used to work there . Jesus , Mayko ! Well , what did you find out , David ? Nothing . Did you call the company and ask them ? - No . - No ? God ! How come you 're so fucking smart ? Cheers . Salud ! Yeah ? They 're over the border in Guatemala . Guatemala ? Yeah , they 're there because the government has excused them from all environmental laws . They actually told me that ! They 're about 400 km south of you . The company is called Entog√®ne . You want to talk to a Jacques Rafause . Malaria , she kills over 2 million people a year in Africa alone . And it 's caused by a parasite . The parasite , she spread in the saliva of the mosquito . The mosquito inserts the parasites , along with anticoagulation saliva into the human . So , what we have done at Entog√®ne is to genetically alter the mosquito so that an anti parasitic protein in the salivary gland of the mosquito is over expressed to kill the parasite before it reaches the human . And so , we eradicate malaria . Yeah , Dr. Rafause , Dr. Rafause ... Could we review your documentation ? Absolutely . I will make espresso . Carlos , come here and take a look at this sucker . The doc engineered a chromosome right here using a p-element containing a salivary gland specific promoter . - A transposon ? - Yeah , a jumping gene . Hey , a Mexican jumping gene ! A transposon is unstable DNA that jumps from one gene to another . In this case , it was a multiplying transposon that they spliced in and it jumped from where they put it in the antiparasite gene and it found itself a nice cozy little home next to an anticoagulation gene in the mosquito . - That happens ? - Well , I 'm not making this shit up . Now the mosquito , well his anticoagulation proteins are being hugely , hugely overproduced . He 's basically a factory for anticoagulant . So , it blocks coagulation in the mosquito 's human victims . The body bleeds to death . We think the anti clotting last for about 24 hours . Afterwards , the body recovers . But in those 24 hours , if you cut yourself , say scrape your knee , you basically bleed to death . Even if ... the males don 't bite and the recombining females are all trapped in there . How could they escape ? - May we , Dr. Rafause ? - Sure . - Hmm ... How are you getting out ? - They don 't . What about the males ? We hatch here , harvest the females and kill the males . How do you sex the females ? It 's an old trick . The females want blood for reproduction , so we put a bag full of warm water on top of the cage . The females are attracted to the warmth and congregate around the bag and with a vacuum cleaner , I can suck out the males and leave the females inside the cage . What are the chances you might suck out 1 of the females by mistake ? 0.01 % . That , doctor , is not as low a number as you might think . It might allow some of the females to stay with the males . What 's the difference ? The males get killed . So , I lose a few females too . - Can you show us how you do it ? - Sure . So , I use a vacuum cleaner . Will you hold it for me , please ? So , you insert in there . And then ... the bag of the vacuum cleaner is burned in the room over there . Nothing gets out . Yeah , but ... They would have to get out of the room . Well , let 's see . Merde ! Pasteur Institute got back to us . They have an experimental larvicide that only kills mosquitoes and has no known effects on any other species .

 * * * * I don 't like this , matt . Oh , you got any better ideas ? It 's a huge risk being out in the open.We should be laying low . And what ? What ? Run forever ? I don 't know . Yeah , that 's my point . We 're being hunted , and we have no idea by who . How , why ? Noah bennet has all the answers we 're looking for . Hey , did you get it ? Amobarbital.One dose of this , he 's knocked out cold . What ? What 's wrong ? Can 't you just read his mind ? Get what we need that way ? No , we 've been over this . Noah is too well trained , and he 's never off his guard . Guys , look , I was a cop . You 're a scientist , a nurse . We did nothing wrong , and they turned us into fugitives . Yeah , but drugging and kidnapping people ? I don 't like it either , but this way gives us answers . Yeah , straight-up interrogation isn 't gonna work . Not with bennet . We 'll need to get creative . Staying at the hotel ? Just for a little while . I 'm actually looking for an apartment in town . You know anything ? Uh , no . Welcome to costa verde . Looks like our friend here had about three too many . Don 't worry , we 'll get him home safe . Well ? It 's working . It 's working . * * * * * * * * * * * * Ten people died last night in ohio when a house spontaneously caught on fire . I 'm thinking we should investigate sooner rather than later . It 's over , noah.It 's all over . Primatech may have burned to the ground , but that doesn 't change anything . We have a lot of work to do . Primatech should have been shut down a long time ago . The company had a good run , but its time has passed . No , we got the job done . Yes , you certainly did . And I appreciate it . What is this ? For your years of service . Pension , severance . And this is from me . Why are you doing this ? Bag and tag.One of us , one of them . It 's an antiquated system desperately trying to remain relevant . So we adapt and we get it right . I don 't think we can.I don 't think we should . I am tired , noah . I have told so many lies . Maybe it 's not to late to cobble my family back together .   It 's a good thing . You get to go home to claire . This is everything you 've ever fought for , and you 've won . This is all I 've ever known . What am I supposed to do now ? Take care of claire . Take care of yourself . All right , so I 'm gonna be able to get to these memories that we 're looking for . I 'm gonna find out exactly how this whole thing happened , who 's behind it , how they work . We 're gonna find out how to stop hiding and start fighting back . And how far are you willing to push ? As far as I need to . Heroes Season3 Episode17 * * * * * * * * * * * This better be good . Face time at state dinners is hard to come by . You heard from bennet ? No , why ? He 's off the grid going on three hours . Standard orders are to check in after duty.He didn 'T . * * * * * * * How ' bout claire , she okay ? Yes , your daughter 's fine . I want every inch of surveillance on noah bennet . Everywhere he 's been , everywhere he might go . You 're spying on your own men ? Nobody 's above scrutiny , myself included . You and bennet are both compromised . What 's that supposed to mean ? Your brother peter , your daughter claire . Peter gets treated like everyone else . Yeah , and claire gets a free pass . That makes both yours and bennet 's choices tarnished . Are you spying on me ? You barely touched your prime rib . Everything okay out there ? Still feels like we 're sitting ducks in here , come on . You can 't rush an interrogation . This isn 't an interrogation , it 's torture . You 're straining his entire system . What , do you think I 'm hurting him on purpose ? I think you have a personal vendetta , yeah . I don 't think you know what the hell you 're talking about . - They killed daphne , matt . - Daphne ... this isn 't about daphne . This is about me helping everybody . Well , you 're not helping him . He has done much worse to me . You 're better than him , matt . - That 's my point . - No , the point is , he 's in pain . Does he have to be ? Look , the drugs are- - it 's not gonna be comfortable . - I 'm digging through his brain- - - To find a memory . Can we really trust this ? I mean , who knows what information 's been tainted by time and perception ? We know nothing--he knows everything that we need to know . He 's right . Do I have your permission to go back in now ? Let 's find out how this whole thing began . * * * * * * * * * * * Need any help ? Um , four letter word ... " thin man dog . " Asta . Asta . I 'm gonna go get changed . If you 're gonna shower , you should go . We have dinner in an hour with the pierots . Who ? Jenny and ken ? We 're on the pta with them at lyle 's school--they 're nice . Oh , right . You didn 't make any other plans , did you ? No , no.Sounds great . It 's nice to have you around . Noah . Nathan . Claire 's , uh ... I have no idea , actually . At the mall , maybe . She 's at the library . - Secret service thing . - Ah , of course . I didn 't want her to see me here . I wanted to talk to you alone . You have a- - a minute ? Yeah , yeah , sure . Come on in . What 's going on ? I 've set some things in motion . Things ... Everything 's gonna change , and I just want you to know claire 's gonna be safe . What do you mean " safe " ? What have you done ? You know , I got into politics so I could ... help people , make the big impact . What have you done ? I 'm certain that you involved yourself with the company for the same reason . You sensed there was a need . Well , that need still exists . People with abilities are a threat . Primatech is closed . Primatech ? With all due respect , primatech never did the job that was required of them . Then you have the solution . The united states government has the resources and the authority to contain this problem . Wait a minute , what are you talking about here , rounding people up ? For starters , yeah . Incarceration 's the only way to make sure everybody 's safe . Everybody . Yourself included . Certain exceptions need to be made . Is claire an exception ? She could be . But I need your help . What do you plan to do once you have everybody ? We find an answer . Get the best team of scientists , and we find a way to eliminate these abilities forever . And if that 's not possible ? I refuse to accept that . My abilities were given to me.They can be taken away . You know you 're gonna be seen as a villain . Locking people away . I 'll play whatever role I need to . Claire will never look at you the same way again . Claire never needs to know . But she will.They all will . And they will blame you . They won 't understand . I have gone so far off the rails with this , so far around the bend ... I nearly killed my own brother . And I just want a chance to make things right . What do you want from me ?  You spent 20 years tracking these people . I want to know how you did it . What is all this stuff ? This is the last 20 years of my life . And you kept it . It 's hard to throw this stuff away . Noah , I am the U.S.Government. We have loads of ... weapons and ... stuff . I realize you don 't need weapons . But you need perspective . And you need to control information . In 30 seconds , you undid a secret that we 've kept for over 30 years . I can 't un-ring that bell . I know you can 'T . Look , I joined the company for a reason .   And that reason doesn 't disappear just because your mother decides to turn off the lights . I thought you 'd enjoy the extra time with your family . There 's only so many crossword puzzles I can do . He planned it all ... with nathan . They did it together . Did you hear what I just said ? Your brother is to blame for all of it . Yeah , I know . - So ? - So ? So what ? I tried to stop him.It didn 't happen . Okay , but what are we gonna do , nothing ? Well , we can 't do anything from memories , can we ? I 've never done this before.It 's not an exact science . It 's not science at all , matt ! If you want to go , just go ! That 's now what I 'm saying . But it 's what you 're thinking huh ? You think you deserve this , to be hunted , after all that you 've done . You 're reading my mind ? I don 't have to read your mind ! You 're an open book . Look , you wanna get caught ? Fine , turn yourself in . But we 're not lugging your baggage . I could say that same thing about you ! I told you this is not about daphne ! Stop ! Both you ! We 're supposed to be on the same side . You don 't think what I 'm getting here is real , huh ? Fine . Storage unit combination lock . In here--it is filled with things we need . Guns , money.Go.   Go ! I 'll go . Try not to kill one another . Jackpot .  , Sir , I think I have something . Where ? Gotcha .  Where is he ? Costa verde , breaking into bennet 's storage facility . Is it a live feed ? We 've got a local team on the move to apprehend him . How does he know about bennet 's storage facility ? They working together ? I 'm reserving judgment . I want him caught . He 's in a room stocked full of guns . Am I clear ? You 're risking your own men 's lives . I want peter caught . No bloodshed . You gentlemen hear that ? Tasers on stun . Yes , sir . We lost visual.Go , now ! Peter should have been back by now . Yeah , just , uh ... just give him some more time . I 'll tell you why peter isn 't here . He 's been captured or killed . Shut him up . I never checked in . They 'll be looking for me by now . - Come on , do it ! - Mohinder knows I 'm right . My storage unit is under surveillance . You sent peter right where they wanted him . You 'd say anything to get the hell out of here . Doesn 't mean I 'm lying . You know me well enough to know that 's true . - Matt , we should go . - He 's right . Your only hope is to let me go , and escape while you can , matt . Wait a second.We 're not finished . You said--you said you- - you check in ... with who ? Who else are you working with ? Show me . I am not letting you in my head . You can 't stop me . Who is it ? Come on , who is it ? * * * * * * * * * * Welcome to building 26 . I see the government spares no penny . Not on equipment , not on personnel . We are building an elite team . Well , I 'm glad to be part of it . Now , there are a few ground rules that I would like to implement . Primatech had a system . One of us , one of them . Working alongside people with abilities . It helps to even the odds . Yes , I read your file . I think we 'd be better served with one of us and one of us . I 'm sorry ? Or 10 of us ... 12 of us ... and none of them . A lot of the people you 're targeting are good people . They 're useful people . Well , this isn 't about ethics.It 's about trust . About us ... and them . By your own admission , your way didn 't exactly work . Prisoners escaping , loyalty issues--it was a mess . A mess . For 20 years , I was successful at making sure that people like you never knew people like them even existed . You don 't presume to know anything about me . I thought I was running this operation . Well , the situation 's become a little bit more complex , noah . It 's important that we look at everything from as many angles as we can . Okay ? Glad to see you got your old job back . How else would I randomly bump into old acquaintances ? Something big is happening . I need your help . Why would I believe anything you say ? Because it 's true . I realize we haven 't always played nice with each other , but ... you have a unique perspective . You 've been ordinary and extraordinary , so you understand our fear . What exactly is happening ? A government program . And it is going to blow up in their face . I need you , mohinder . I need your brain.I need your strength . Together , we can help people . We can save lives . What do you say ? He came to you . What ? I just saw you and him in a cab . You knew about this . You didn 't tell him ? All right matt , let me explain . Why didn 't you tell him ? I wasn 't talking to anybody . I thought it was the safest thing . That 's why you didn 't want me in his head . You didn 't care about his health . You were afraid of what I 'd find . No . Yes , he approached me . But I said no . You should have told me about this . Why didn 't you tell- - Uhh ! What could I have done ? Tied up on an airplane too ! You think I don 't regret any of this ? You 're my friend . You could have warned me ! You could have warned all of us ! I didn 't know what to do . I didn 't believe him . - Even after the plane , the leash- - - What , told you that I could 've stopped all of this ? That I could have maybe prevented daphne 's death ? If I had , I 'd probably be the one tied up in that chair . All right , check back there.I got over here . Hi . We gotta hurry.They found me.They 're gonna find us . We 're gonna get all the answers we 're looking for without the drugs . I want him to feel everything .   How do we fight back ? You always have a plan , now you 're gonna share it with us . Listen to peter and get the hell out of here while you still can . How much time do you think you have , matt , before they find us ? Maybe we should just take what peter has and run . You don 't get a vote ! - What are you talking about ? - Nothing . Mohinder knew that we were gonna get attacked by the government . Is that true ? Bennet came to me , yes . But I didn 't believe him . He manipulated me before , and I didn 't think I could trust him . Why didn 't you say something ? As if any of you would believe me after what I 've done . Yeah , it 's better that we didn 'T . You 're a coward ! Can you get anything more out of him ? I was just about to do that . Who 's the guy you were taking orders from , huh ? * * * * * Wait , wait , what guy ? I thought he was in charge . Turns out he 's still middle management . Who is he ? Who ? * * * * * * * * * * You . You got a minute ?   I think we got off on the wrong foot . I was hoping we could talk . What are we gonna talk about ? We 're gonna be working together . I thought maybe it 'd be a good idea if we , uh ... What ? Got to know each other better ? Understood where the other guy was coming from . I already know where you 're coming from . And where is that ? You got a family at home . A wife , a boy . And your daughter claire , right ? She 's the special one with the soft spot in the center of her soft heart . That 's right . You 're a dime a dozen . And 11 of the 12 are unreliable . You don 't know anything about me . That 's the whole point of this . All that time you worked at your company , you danced the fine line between company man and family man . I 'm not much for dancing . You 're oversimplifying it . I think you 're overcomplicating it . Hunting them or harboring them ... to win this war for good , it takes focus . And yours is just a little split right now . I 've read your files too , mr.Danko.  I 've known men like you . - Is that right ? - Sure . Simple , unconnected.Take your work home with you . You 're never off the job . You think that makes you perfect . Not perfect , just better than you . These aren 't terrorists you 're hunting . They 're people . They 're targets . This job is about understanding their humanity , not their ability . But you have to be human to do that . You 're a valuable asset . But once we begin engagement , I have to know ...   are you gonna take orders , or continue undermining me with every glance ? You 're the boss . Matt , don 't do this . Don 't push this any further . Peter , I got another address for you . - No ... - What did you see ? No , you go after this guy and you 're dead . You 're all dead.You can 't undo it . This guy 's in charge . Don 't listen to him . This is why we came . We want to cripple them.We want to hurt them . This is the guy . No , peter , you 're making a big mistake . You 're unraveling things you don 't understand . Peter ! Peter ! Secure all the exits . Wait for my order before moving in . I want eyes on the scene . You really should lock your windows . Sir , we have a situation . Tell me you found bennet . No , sir , not bennet . Did you already mobilize the unit ? I was waiting for your order , senator . So you 're the one that 's driving all this . Making us run , hide . Peter , right ? You 're the good brother . Compassionate one . You want me dead ? Do it . You wanna die ? No.But you came here with a mission , right ? So ... get it over with . You think you 're innocent ? That you 're the good guy ? You broke into my house , put a gun to my head . You are the one who 's hunting us . With good reason . And it 's not ever gonna stop . 'Cause if you kill me , I 'll get exactly what I want . And what is that ? They 'll see what I 've been telling them . They 'll know just how dangerous you people are . He 's right , you know . Hello , nathan . Don 't do it , pete . How the hell 'd you get here so fast ?   I know you might think I 'm the bad guy here , pete , and maybe I am . - But you 've gotta believe me when I tell you- - - I don 'T . I 'm done believing in you . This isn 't you . All right ... if you kill him . The order will come down to kill you all , and I won 't be able to contain- - Just shut up ! Shut ... up ! Let ' em figure a way out of this . I was right . You can 't trust either of them.Not really . They 're moving in on matt and mohinder right now . You pull the trigger , you 're signing their death warrant . Why did you tell him about parkman and suresh ? I just saved your life . You 're welcome ! Move in . Take ' em now ! They don 't know which room we 're in.We should make a break for it . You 're never gonna stop hunting us . Even when you had the chance to stop , you didn 'T . Daphne 's alive , matt.They have her , alive . - You 're lying to me . - No , no , no , no . See for yourself.I won 't fight you . I go back inside your head right now and we get caught . Go in . Find out . I 'll hold them off . It 's what you 've wanted . All right , go . * * * * * This one 's alive . Gunshot wound to the shoulder . Get a sedative . It 's gonna take three times the normal amount to keep this one down . Daphne 's alive , matt . Come on . I said come on , all of you ! Matt , listen to me.You 're not a killer . This is only gonna get worse for you . You 're gonna have to escalate beyond anything you could ever imagine ! You should have just taken the damn watch and stayed home . Drop it . Don 't hurt him . Is there anyone else here ? No , just me . Let me walk him out . Just ... let me walk him out . * * * * * * * * * Take a hard look at yourself before you judge me .   It wasn 't too long ago you had me tied up . Don 't use me to rationalize your actions . What I did , what you 're doing is wrong ! The curtain is up . The government is involved in this now . What you did- - what peter , what matt did- - it got in the way of what I 'm trying to accomplish . And what 's that , exactly ?   The plane you were on . That was taking you to a facility that was meant to contain you . Well , your actions supported the hard-liners , who believe you should all be executed . Me ... I still believe containment can work . You 're gonna round us up and imprison us forever ? That 's your plan ? That 's the first part . Then we 're gonna find a way to control these powers . To eliminate them , so we can go back to living what 's left of our lives . But I need your help . That 's not gonna happen . You believe science has all the answers , right ? Why don 't you start with her ? Daphne ! She is alive . For now . But I 'm losing that battle . And unless you help me , I can assure you that my associates are gonna kill her . And then they 're gonna kill you . And then they 're gonna kill my brother ... and matt . You 'll all be dead . Protocol after a man 's taken prisoner is to grant him shore leave . Maybe you ought to take a few days off . Matt my wife kicked me out of the house . My daughter is scared to death of me . What am I gonna do with time off ? You were right before . When you said I was weak because of my split focus . That 's not gonna be a problem anymore . The job is all that 's left . You have my complete dedication . You still think I 'm compromised ? They found your storage unit . Which , unless I 'm mistaken , led you right to them . You 're the one that let ' em get away . Yeah , I admit ... I underestimated them . They got away because senator petrelli let his personal interests cloud his judgment . Kid gloves are standard issue in this outfit . You had I have to change that . You agree ? Absolutely . So ? All things considered , it went pretty well . I think he trusts me . Don 't be foolish , noah . That man trusts no one . He will continue to test you . I 'm prepared to be tested . Because he 's got it all wrong . And so does nathan , for that matter . There 's no halfway anymore . You 're gonna have to play the role . Make tough choices to prove your loyalty to them , to their cause . You know me . I 've always been comfortable with morally gray . No ... no , no . This can 't happen.All I wanted to do was find daphne . This is why I didn 't want to paint the future . Matt ! You 're not capable of this , okay ? You are not a murderer . How the hell do you explain this ? Heroes Season3 Episode17

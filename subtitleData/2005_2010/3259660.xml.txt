Way ahead of you . It 's already in the works . You want something to do , you should look into her husband . He found the body . Called it in around 9 : 00 . My favorite part of the job . " Sorry for your loss . Got an alibi ? " Always go first to the nearest and dearest . And he 's upstairs . " New hope for post-traumatic stress disorder . " Dr. Evelyn Prender and Dr. Martha Fox . I 'm gonna take this with me . Hope it helps . Eva , let 's go upstairs . Medical examiner estimates time of death between 5 : 00 and 7 P.M. , roughly . I--I was at my office at Sloan-Kettering . Uh , I was , uh , finishing some work . I was talking to colleagues , seeing , uh , patients . I left a little after 8 : 00 . I--I got home , and , uh ... I found Evelyn . We 'll need names . I understand . Are you a psychiatrist , Dr. Prender ? I 'm an oncologist . Do you have , uh , thoughts who might have done this ? We thought we 'd start with your wife 's patients . I find that hard to imagine , because , uh , Evelyn 's patients are upscale , neurotic , nonviolent , mostly female . She had an award in her office for her work with veterans . Evelyn does ... she did pro bono work at the , uh , V.A. and the E.R. at St. Francis . Not here ? No , the vets didn 't , uh , ? with her Park Avenue patients and with the neighborhood . St. Francis ? Yeah . I can give you the name of her colleague there . It 's Dr. , uh ... Sara Dillane . Dr. Dillane ? Yes . Detective Marquez . This is detective Amsterdam . May we have a moment ? Dr. Prender 's husband gave us your name . Oh , yeah , of course . You 're here about Evelyn . What a terrible thing . Have--have we met ? I have one of those faces . Tell us about her work . Evelyn specialized in veterans ' mental health issues . I 'm sorry , what did you say your name was ? John Amsterdam . We 'd like to interview her patients . If we could take a look at her files ... you know that 's privileged . We 'll have a court order by this afternoon . Come back then and talk to an administrator . Really , I can 't help you . We will , but ... time 's everything in a homicide investigation . If you can . Point us in the right direction , mention a name ... Evelyn was worried about a guy named Lonny Amadee . She said he was violent , paranoid , delusional , fixated on her , convinced she was gonna medicate him against his will . Violent , paranoid , delusional . Post-traumatic stress . Raging . They used to call it soldier 's heart . Soldier 's heart ? Shell shock , battle fatigue , post-traumatic stress syndrome . Different wars , different names for the same thing . Soldier 's heart , whatever you call it , Lonny Amadee 's got it . Dr. Dillane , we have a gsw in the E.R. I have some other questions for you when you have more time . I have questions , too , so ... I 'll call you . Make an appointment . I 'll be waiting . What was that about ? What ? She couldn 't stop staring at you , you were flirting with her . I wasn 't . Shamelessly . - And when we walked up , her reaction- - - I get that a lot . It 's , uh- - I know . It 's your face . Mr. Amadee , what can you tell us about Dr. Prender ? Prender wanted to put me on this drug . Some kind of blocker she called it . Beta blocker . What 's the big deal ? It takes the edge off . Yeah , that 's just how she said it . Takes the edge off . No big deal . Dull the pain , Lonny . Dull the memory . Make it safe . What 's wrong with that ? Anbar province . Corpse on the side of the road . We stopped to pick it up , take it to the morgue , so the family can I.D. the body , give him a proper burial . It was booby-trapped . V.C. did the same thing . Well , 2 guys in my squad blew their legs off at the knees . I watched them bleed out while the medics tried to save them . Why wouldn 't you want to forget something like that ? Because that would mean it didn 't matter . That it was all for nothing . In vain . But that 's not even what I remember most . The corpse ... was a kid . An 8-year-old boy . Gangrene . You gonna take my leg , doc ? No need . You 'll die if I don 't . Sorry I didn 't . Wish I had . You 'll feel different when it 's done . Ether . Running low--again . I need it now , Walt . Do me a favor ? Save it for somebody else . It 'd be a mercy . I swore a solemn oath . Solemn oath . Well , god love you , doctor . I guess you have no choice . No , I don 't . Check out his alibi , talk to his girlfriend , for what it 's worth . - Ptsd , ever had it ? - No . You ? Off and on , for the last 300 years . Seriously . Ok . 350 . Whatever . Amadee 's girlfriend says he was with her . Of course . You don 't believe her ? Personally , I think she was lying through her teeth . Everybody lies . Even when they don 't have to . Well , they lifted some prints from the weapon . Running them through afis and the army C.I. lab now . The myth of fingerprints . What , you don 't believe in fingerprints ? No two people in the world have the same fingerprints ? It 's an untested , untestable hypothesis . You 'd have to fingerprint everybody in the world to prove it . Well , I do believe in fingerprints , Pally . And if the perp 's a vet or has a record , we 're gonna get a hit , guaranteed . Amsterdam . Be right there . What ? It pisses me off when he does that . Better get used to it . So unkind . So who 's Harold Wilcox ? He was walking down the middle of broadway raving about Dr. Prender . And he had this . He had an appointment with her that day . It wasn 't in the books . 5 pm , about the time the M.E. says she was murdered . I 'm gonna call the lieutenant . When will he be lucid enough to talk ? - In a couple hours . - In the meantime you want to tell me how you got up from the dead and walked out of my E.R. ? I remember the heart attack . I remember seeing you on the platform just before . I remember a feminine presence hovering over me like an angel , full of tenderness and concern . That was you , wasn 't it ? I 'm a doctor , not an angel . Of course I was concerned . You had a heart attack on a subway platform . After that , what 's the next thing that you remember ? Waking up in the hospital . In the morgue . You were dead , you woke up in the morgue , and then you just got up and left . Yep . That 's not ever happened before ? A patient rising from the dead ? Not in my experience , no . How long have you been an E.R. doctor ? 3 years . Don 't change the subject . I worked on you myself , detective , to bring you back . Thank you . I didn 't save you . You must have . Your heart had stopped . I couldn 't do anything about it . I must not have been dead , obviously . Your blood work was curious . It had anomalies . Anomalies . A toxic level of lead . Native American genetic markers . A great-great-great - great-grandmother was part lenape . Lenape . The original inhabitants of manhattan . The ones who sold it to the dutch ? Old wives ' tale . Trust me , it never happened . You know what ? Maybe you should run more tests . You 'd be up for that ? If you 'll do them , personally . Absolutely . I don 't--I don 't remember about Dr. Prender . You had an appointment at her office . I don 't know . I 'm walking down broadway and then they brought me here . Then they told me what happened ... and you lost it . Sometimes my grip on reality is , uh , you know , precarious . Well , that 's why we 're gonna hold on to you for a couple of days . Ok ? Ok . Is this what they mean by the city that never sleeps ? Which is why it looks like hell in the morning . You saw her . I can tell . She 's gonna run more tests . Wait 'll she gets the results . How did you explain the dying / not dying thing ? I didn 't . I see . I want her to get to know me first . Oh , what a tangled web we weave . Spare me . I hate getting parental advice from my children . Do they take requests ? When they 're written on a $ 20 bill . Ask them to play how long has this been going on ? Amsterdam . Ok . We got a hit on the fingerprints . You don 't seem too happy about it . Usually I can tell when someone 's lying to me . Must be losing your touch . Your fingerprints were found on the murder weapon , sergeant . You bashed her head in with an award she won for working with guys like you , trying to help them . There was blood on your jacket . I fell . Nosebleed . Dr. Prender 's blood . Dr. Prender 's ? Is the blood back from the lab already ? No way . Smooth move . Make the perp think you 've got forensics . I would have done the same . You went to her office , sergeant . You told me you didn 't , but you did . I just wanted to talk to her . You had a fight , sergeant . What did you fight about ? Never no fight . Well , you picked up that piece of glass and you struck her . No . I knelt down ... and tried to help her . That 's how I got the blood on my jacket . After you hit her . I don 't remember that at all . - You remember picking up the glass . - yeah - Yeah . - I do She was all bloody . She tried to say something . I tried to wipe the blood off . And then ... she made a little sound ... and she died . I tried to help her . But she died . You tried to help her . After you hit her . You saw her lying there in her own blood . I did . You felt bad about it . Yeah . I did . She tried to help you , Harold ... and you killed her . I don 't know how I would have done that . Did she try to make you do something you didn 't want to do ? Maybe . Send you to a hospital , put you on medication ? Could be . Yeah . Could be you killed her . I guess I did . You guess you did ... or you did ? I did . He opened the door and the guy walked right through . You killed Dr. Prender . I did . Yeah , I remember now . I ... I did . I killed her . Well and deftly done . If he lives , he 'll thank you . He 'll curse me first . Operation enduring freedom website . Wilcox , Harold . Wilcox , Harold Lamar , staff sergeant . Silver star , Afghanistan . Hey , Walt , how is he ? Fever 's gone . No infection . Letter home ? A note to my wife , telling her the good news . What 's her name ? Mary . I 'm sure she 's fine . If she 's not , there 's nothing I can do for her . How do you feel ? My leg hurts . I can 't give you more morphine . Morphine wouldn 't help , doc . It 's not the part of my leg I 've got that bothers me . It 's the piece that 's gone . The part you sawed off . Yeah . That 's common . Itches , something fierce . Phantom limb , it 's called . That feeling leaves . Phantom , huh ? It 'll fade away eventually . That 's just what I 'm fixin ' to do , doctor . Excuse me ? Fade away . We all fade away , eventually . I 'm thinking sooner rather than later . Online content , journal of psychiatric , et cetera . Follow-up letter to Dr. Prender 's article on ptsd . " Alludes to litigation involving Dr. Prender . " Lucas vs. Prender . Evelyn Prender was the defendant ... psychiatric malpractice . You know , uh , Evelyn always was interested in memory , how it works . She 'd just finished a book about it , found a publisher . We never have as much time as we think . I wanted to ask you about a lawsuit . Your wife was a defendant . Lucas vs. Prender ? Yes . A patient 's family sued her for malpractice . - You 've heard of recovered memory ? - Yeah . Well , that lawsuit helped Evelyn realize how terribly mistaken she 'd been . That 's when she started working with veterans . Yeah , it was her way of making amends , I suppose . You know , ptsd , st-traumatic stress , is the opposite of recovered memory . It 's the memories you can 't forget , as opposed to the ones you can 't remember . That was years ago , before we met . I--I don 't really know the details . You know , it wasn 't something she liked to talk about . Who would know ? Dr. Macvittie , what can you tell us about the lawsuit ? Evelyn and I were partners when the lucas family sued her . Susan Lucas was one of Dr. Prender 's recovered memory patients . I was always very fond of Evelyn . But ... I can 't forgive her . Why is that ? Well , it would have been one thing if she had just walked away , abandoned her patients , but she actually recanted . Recanted ? Apologized to her patients , begged their forgiveness , urged them to return to their families . The perpetrators . The cause of their misery . It was very confusing for them , very damaging . What happened to Susan Lucas , after Dr. Prender told her the whole thing was a mistake , that her father never abused her ? She became my patient . We 'd like to speak with her . Give me your number . I 'll pass it along . If she wants to get in touch with you , I 'm sure she will . And you and Dr. Prender ? Dissolved our partnership , amicably . Do you still practice recovered memory ? I can 't abandon my patients . Some of them have been with me for years . Shouldn 't they be getting better by now ? The wounds are deep , the root causes primal . You think Dr. Prender was wrong , that Susan Lucas ' father did abuse her ? I have never doubted that for a moment . There 's no greater crime ... than for a parent to do that to a child . Mr. Lucas , how old was Susan when she became Dr. Prender 's patient ? That 's when everything changed . That 's when the whole world turned upside down . One day your kid comes to you and says , " daddy , I 'm feeling a little anxious about ... things- - " school , work . Maybe I should talk to somebody . " Sure . Whatever you want . I 'll pay for it . And the next thing you know , you 're accused of being a child molester . Your whole life is in shambles . You lose your family , your friends , all because some therapist who 's never met you , doesn 't know anything about you or your family , convinces your precious child that you committed unspeakable acts . You sued Dr. Prender . We had to do something . Judge threw it out on a technicality , said we had no standing . Her own family . We couldn 't sue the doctor that destroyed everything we had . Funny thing , though . The lawyers didn 't give us a refund . We 'd like to talk to your daughter . So would I. She hasn 't spoken to us in 10 years . Have a nice day . Angry guy . I could like him for this , except for the fact we already have a suspect in custody . Why are we doing this ? You already got Wilcox to confess . Staff sergeant Harold Wilcox- - the guy was a hero . Evelyn Prender was trying to help him . And he resented it deep down , felt emasculated . I want to keep working this just a little longer . - Wilcox reminds me of someone . - Who ? Another vet . Someone I knew a long time ago . Someone I failed . Sullivan ... he 's melancholy . It 's temporary . Oh , I 'm not so certain . He 's pining away for something he 'll never have . What 's that ? His old life . Nostalgia . More than that . Soldier 's heart , they call it . Soldier 's heart . It 's what happens to a man when he studies war too hard , too long . What can I do ? Sit with him . Talk to him . I haven 't the time . Besides , we 've all done that . What ? Studied too much war . If that were the cause , we 'd all have soldier 's heart . Maybe we do . Amsterdam , Wilcox confessed . You broke him . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Amsterdam . Yes . See you ere . That was the daughter . Susan Lucas . She wants to talk , about her father . Oh , yeah . Dr. Prender tried to apologize . And you wouldn 't accept it . I know my memories are true . You know your father abused you ? I do . And I know he won 't take responsibility for what he did to me . And I know he blames Dr. Prender for everything . If he 'd just ... he 'd say he was sorry ... I don 't know . Maybe I could forgive him . Do you think your father could have killed Dr. Prender ? My father 's capable of anything . But why now ? The lawsuit was years ago . Because he 's going bankrupt . Because my mother 's leaving him . And he blames Dr. Prender . For ruining his life . What about you ? Did she ruin your life , too ? No . She helped me . She 's the one who helped me remember . But then she told you the whole thing was a mistake , that it never happened . I think it was just too much for her . What was ? The truth . What happened to her patients . I think it was just too awful to bear , so she decided it wasn 't real . But it was . I didn 't hate Dr. Prender . I felt sorry for her . James Lucas . No alibi for the night of the murder , hated prender with a passion . I hate to rain on your parade , but nothing places lucas at the scene . Besides , we already have a suspect in custody whose fingerprints are on the weapon and who 's confessed . Amsterdam doesn 't buy it was Wilcox . Of course not . Forensics and a confession- - that 's too easy for Amsterdam . He 's gotta go fishing for more esoteric suspects . What about susan lucas , the daughter ? She 's got no alibi either . Says she can 't remember where she was that day . Well , she staked everything on her therapy . Then prender turns around and says , " you know what ? It never happened . " After she destroyed her family . I 'd want to kill my therapist , too . Whatever . Knock yourselves out . But you 'd better hurry , because the D. A. likes the guy we got . And so do I. You saw her lying there in her own blood . I did . And you felt bad about it . I did . You tried to help her . What are you doing ? Watch this . I did . I was there in the observation room . I didn 't see it . - See what ? - I led him . Watch . - You tried to help her , Harold . - Yeah . And you killed her . I led Wilcox . Got him to remember something that didn 't actually happen . I didn 't mean to , but I did . I ended up hurting him in the worse possible way . Which is exactly what prender did to susan lucas and her family . You guess you did ... or you did ? I did . - That was a false confession ? - Yeah . What are you gonna do about it ? Follow Evelyn Prender 's example . I remember now . I did it . I didn 't do it ? No . How do you know ? How do you know I didn 't do it ? How do I know ? Sullivan . Now give me the gun . I 'm disinclined to do that , doctor . Believe me , I ain 't nothin ' but grateful if I didn 't kill that woman . But how do I know for sure ? I 'm not sure I can live with myself . - I can help you . - Can you ? Can you give me my leg back ? I remember hitting her . It never happened . It 's a false memory . Can you send me home to my wife , the way that I was ? I think not . - I picked up the glass . - Yeah . She died in my arms . No ! No , don 't ! That part 's true . That part of what you remember is true . You didn 't kill her . I 'll prove it to you . How ? Arrest the person who did it . What are you doing here ? Thought I 'd make that appointment . You could have called . I could have . Follow me . - What are you doing ? - Checking my pulse . That 's my job . It 's just a little experiment . It 's not just traumatic events that make the pulse race . This won 't be traumatic . It is racing . Told you . I read the articles you wrote on ptsd therapies with Dr. Prender . Evelyn was intensely interested in how memory works . Especially the effect of trauma on memory . Biochemistry tends to reinforce traumatic memory , not bury it . Traumatic events are seared into the memory by adrenaline . Adrenaline ? The adrenaline surges , the het pounds , the pulse races . That 's why soldiers and crime victims and holocaust survivors and the victims and first responders from 9 / 11 have had such a hard time putting the past behind them . You ok ? When did Dr. Prender change her mind about recovered memory ? Her epiphany came one day when one of her patients suddenly remembered her mother killing the neighbor 's baby , frying it for breakfast , and making her eat it . Fried babies . Think you 'd remember something like that . That 's when evelyn realized the whole thing was just hysteria and that she 'd been complicit in encouraging these destructive fantasies . She had a partner at that time . Leonard Macvittie ? They had a really bitter falling-out over it . Are you sure Prender 's ok with this ? He told me where he hides the spare key , didn 't he ? Relax . I have the owner 's permission , and whatever we find is admissible . I wish we had a warrant . There 's an old one in the glove compartment if it makes you feel better . What exactly are we looking for ? Prender said his wife was publishing a book . Why would she hide the manuscript ? Someone found out she was writing a book . Someone didn 't care for something that was in it . Someone asked her to take it out before it was published . When she refused ... someone killed her . Do you have an idea who ? I 'll tell you when we find it . It 's a desk . I already looked through it . It 's a campaign desk from the civil war . Heavy suckers . Fascinating . Soldiers in the field needed a place to store secret documents , so they usually had a hidden compartment built in . Like this . You are a freak of nature . Yeah , so I 've been told . Dr. Leonard Macvittie . It must have been a real shock to you when she recanted . Evelyn caved . When the media turned against us and the wind started blowing the other way , she abandoned the truth . Did you know she was writing a book ? Was she ? Did you know that you were in it , prominently featured ? I don 't see my name anywhere . Sorry . This is , uh , garbage . Libelous trash . Which page was that ? The page where Dr. Prender accuses Dr. Macvittie here of knowing the therapy was bogus . That the memories they were recovering were false . Isn 't that called malpractice ? What case was that again ? Susan lucas and her family . When this is published , maybe they 'll sue Dr. Macvittie this time . You were still treating her for abuse that never happened . Illegal , immoral , unethical . Have I left anything out ? If this is published , I 'll sue her husband , I 'll sue the estate , I-I 'll sue the editor , the publisher , anything else- - We 're just the messengers . Ok ? You can 't sue us . But if he could ... he 'd ... kill us . Ok . These are Dr. Macvittie 's prints from the manuscript page . And these ... are from the murder weapon . I 've identified 18 ridge characteristics in alignment . Which is about as definitive a match as you can get . Want to pick him up ? I 'll take Santori . He just loves shrinks . What are you gonna do ? Doctor 's appointment . Everything ok ? Routine tests . thank you . Thank you . Thank you . For what ? It 's a long story . Get yourself some help . Some real help . - I 'll try . - Don 't try . Do it . Find somebody . All right . Somebody who knows what they 're doing . You did what you could . The operation was a success , but the physician botched the convalescence . I knew how to cut off his leg , but not how to cure his melancholy . Melancholy . It 's a mystery . It either gets better of its own accord or not . Still ... I should have sat with him , as you suggested . It ... it might have helped him . I 've written something . Published it myself . Thank you . Leaves of grass . What are you grinnin ' about ? I 'm remembering an old friend . He gave me a copy of his book . It 'd be worth some money these days . Somebody we heard of ? He used to be famous . In the future , who knows ? Better strike while the iron is hot . How 'd your tests go , by the way ? I need to follow up on that . Dr. Dillane ? Detective . I was in the neighborhood , thought I 'd catch you , ask you about those test results . You should come by the office . Of course . Robert , this is detective Amsterdam . Detective . Detective , this is my husband Robert Camp . Pleased to meet you .

 " And the bear came across a fox , and the fox said : 'Bear , bear , stop right there . There 's a monster up ahead . ' " - Okay , bedtime . - No , no . This is the last book . Oh , I thought that the last book was the last book . We are almost done . You guys work well together and I don 't like it . - Hello . - Hey , it 's Peter . Hi . What 's wrong ? - What 's wrong ? - Is there something wrong ? No , why ? What 's wrong with you ? Uh , nothing . I assumed there was an emergency . No . No emergency . What 's up ? Nothing . I was actually calling for Rachel . Is she there ? - Yeah . - It 's stupid . I can call back later if you 're in the middle of something . - No , no . She 's right here . Uh , Rach , it 's for you . It 's Peter . Oh . Hey . Yeah , did you remember it or not ? Are you serious ? - What is it ? - Aunt Liv , can we keep on going ? - No . No , I don 't know that one . - Yeah . All right , hold on . Hold on a second . Hold on . Uh ... " ' But I don 't see any monster , ' the bear said . And he kept walking . Because he didn 't believe there was a monster up ahead . " Aunt Liv ? Yeah ? Monsters aren 't real , right ? No , sweetheart . They 're not . Cameras are dark . - Let 's go . We gotta move . - I told you , relax . The alarm 's disabled . - There might be a backup system . - There isn 't . I checked the security . Why don 't you finish up in here ? I wanna see what 's behind this door . Come on , Jonathan , we gotta get out of here . Hold on a second . Stop right there ! You should be arrested for what you do . We 've let them all go . All of them . These animals deserve better . How would you like to be caged up and tortured ? Shame on you for what you do . These are living creatures and you murder them . You 're a killer . Tell me you didn 't open that door in there . Yeah , you bet I did . - Get out . Now . All of you , get out ! - You should be arrested . - Experimenting on animals is a crime . - Somebody shut her up . Ahh ! Go . Let 's go . Let 's go ! Come on , get out , go . - Jonathan ! - No , no , no . Get to the car , get to the car . Go , go . - What was that ? - That thing grabbed that guy . Get out of here , step on it . Do we call the police ? We can 't leave Jonathan . We have to go back . - No , dude . Go , go , go . - No , no . This is crazy , this is crazy . What is that ? I don 't know . I can 't see anything ! Chris ? What did that ? - One cream , one sugar . - Thank you , Peter . - Peter , no ! - Walter , we talked about sharing . - That 's not to eat . You 've ruined it . - It 's an omelet . It 's not an omelet . Oh , my ... Ugh ! - Why is there an ear in the omelet ? - It was an experiment . It was a protein-rich incubator . It was growing . It was growing ? That 's perfect . No , it 's not perfect . You just ruined it . - You could have died had you eaten it . - Hello ? You know , maybe in the future you could do me a favor and put up a sign warning me not to confuse your toxic playthings with breakfast . You should get your own breakfast and not poach mine . That is hardly the point . I nearly washed my face in a sink of acid . You hooked Gene up to the solar panels and I nearly electrocuted myself . This is a lab . You 're the one who should be careful . You look both ways when you cross the street . The difference being , if I don 't , I 'm the only one who gets flattened . You , Walter , you live in a society with other people ... - Hey . - What ? ! That was Olivia . Local P.D. found the vehicle a couple hours ago . Three bodies inside . Two male , one female . And the cause of death ? Appear to have been attacked by an animal . The coroner 's never seen anything like it . Whatever did this doesn 't appear to be indigenous . Well , wherever it is indigenous to , I don 't wanna live there . - How interesting . - Some would say disgusting . Whatever did this had enormous claws . Like those of a bear or one of the big cats . Spread of the digit , V-shaped , it 's too wide for one of those creatures . Configuration closer to that of an eagle . Of course , much , much larger . Hey , we 're looking for Big Bird . Don 't be ridiculous . Perhaps a pterodactyl . Have Evidence techs bagged their IDs ? No , I don 't think they were carrying any . - Maybe this is why . - It 's a Brockhage lock-pick gun . They work great . A little bulky for my taste , but ... These kids were out for more than a joyride . - This is quite delicious . - Where did you get that ? - In the car , uneaten . - What is the matter with you ? Oh , forgive my son . He 's been in a mood all day . I figured " don 't eat the evidence " went without saying . It has no bearing on the case , I assure you . Four drinks . Three bodies . There were four people in this group . We 're missing a body . - Have we searched the woods ? - Canine units canvassed the area . - We didn 't turn up any bodies . - Maybe one of them got away , survived . If they did , they could answer questions . I 'm gonna check local hospitals . See if the emergency room has anything that lines up with an animal attack . All this stuff is from Junky Genies . It 's a fast-food joint up by MIT . Food is crap , but it 's cheap and open late . It 's always filled with undergrads . I thought you falsified your degree from MIT . Yeah , Peter . Why commit to anything when you can just fake it ? I spent some nights there . Maybe we should go through the student database and see if we can ID any of the victims . - Hey . - Hi . I understand Chris Hawkins lives here . Olivia Dunham , FBI . Whoa . Yeah , Chris isn 't here . I know . Mind if I asked you a few questions ? I 'm Carl , and , no , I would love it . Come on in . Thank you . Oh , yeah . That isn 't mine . That was left here by a stranger . Can I get you something ? Orange juice ? Candy ? How about some pants ? Yeah , I can do that . - So how well do you know Chris ? - Oh , you know , okay . " Hey , how 's it going ? " " Nice . " " Whatever . " " What 's for dinner ? " That kind of stuff . Is he in some kind of trouble ? - I 'm not at liberty to say . - Oh , no , no , no . Just because he doesn 't seem like the type . You know , to get into FBI kind of trouble . Why do you say that ? He 's always making fliers , going to rallies . You know , political . - So , what kind of causes ? - It 's really just the one . Animals Forever , I think it 's called ? Or ... No , no , no . Animals First . - He was an animal-rights activist ? - Yeah , definitely . He 'd save anything with a beak or a claw . Jeez , whatever got to him had some pretty nasty claws . - And some very large fangs . - What is that ? Gouges from the fangs of most likely some type of viper . So this thing had the claws of a lion and the fangs of a snake ? It reminds me of a woman I once knew in Cleveland . These punctures are over 4 inches apart . I mean , that would make this snake 8 feet long . - Her name was Harriet something . - How is everything ? Well , apparently , you 're looking for a lion-snake named Harriet . Did you find anything at MIT ? Yeah . The victims were all animal-rights activists . A group called Animals First . They were breaking into labs that were doing testing ? And releasing the animals . Which would explain the burglary tools and lack of ID . It wouldn 't explain how whatever it is these guys released was able to rip a door off their car and kill them . Any idea what kind of animal would be in a lab that could do this ? Well , judging by the wounds I 'd say two or three different ones , actually . Right . A motley crew of lab animals got together and decided to exact their revenge on mankind . Astrid , let 's look up labs in the area that do research with animals and ... See if any of them reported break-ins ? Yep , I 'm on it . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Oh , no . This is Unit 81 . We 're responding to the monster sighting on Route 30 . Roger that , 81 . It 's always a monster . Monster must be housewife for " raccoon . " You hear that ? Any leads on the fourth victim ? No . What ? Nothing . You called Rachel last night . - Anything important ? - Hardly . You know that song : " If you like pina coladas ... " ? We were trying to remember the name . Turns out it 's called , " Escape . " So you two are friends now . Does that bother you ? No . Hey , Charlie , what 's up ? Oh , good heavens . Astrid ? Charlie just called . Animal Control got a call from a woman in Newton who claims that she nearly hit a monster on Route 30 . I 'm gonna meet him there . Call me if you find anything ? - Yeah , sure thing . - Thanks . Olivia . Be careful . Thank you , Walter . What was that all about ? Nothing . Just want her to be safe . Hello ? It 's Francis . I need medevac teams and backup sent to my location . Charlie ? Charlie ? Charlie . - How bad is it ? - I don 't know . I 'm all right . - What was it ? - Big . What the heck is that ? Put the stinger in here , please . Now , please . In here . Excellent , thank you . Thank you very much . Agent , I 'd like you to get that eyed down at the hospital . No , thanks . That won 't be necessary . Agent Francis , I 'm told you were attacked by the beast . - What did it feel like ? - It hurt . No , I mean the animal 's dermis . Was it rough like a rhinoceros ? I haven 't felt any rhinos lately , but it was coarse like sandpaper . And the metasoma , the tail , was it segmented like a scorpion ? I didn 't get a good look at it . It kept on knocking me on my ass . Perhaps you did , you just can 't remember . Trauma can do that . I could hypnotize you ... Walter , I think that that 's enough for the moment . It would be very helpful to identify the traits . Are you okay ? Did you take something ? Psychedelics ? No , not since Thursday , no . Walter , why don 't you share what you 're thinking ? I believe we may be dealing with a transgenic species . - Which is what ? - It 's an animal creation . An organism made up of the genes of multiple species . The best of the best , as it were . You 're saying that you think the creature is man-made . Accelerated Darwinism . - Is that even possible ? - In theory , yes . Although one would have to solve many problems . Incompatible species , massive mutual rejection similar to when a transplant recipient rejects a donor organ . And there 's a reason for that . Mixing a bunch of species to create a frankenrhino is unnatural . And a really bad idea . - Dunham . - Hey , it 's me . Is Charlie all right ? - Yeah , he 's okay . - Thank God . Okay , you wanted me to look into any labs that might house animals near the first crime scene . And ? - How can I help you , Agent Dunham ? - Dr. Swift . You could start by telling me what sort of work you do here at Swift Research . Well , we 're commissioned by pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies to test their products . To make sure they 're safe before using them in human trials . By testing them on animals first . It 's an unfortunate but necessary step . You know , it 's better to have an animal experience an allergic reaction to a certain perfume so that you don 't have to . Dr. Swift , are you aware a group of college students were attacked and killed near this facility last night ? - Attacked ? By whom ? - That 's what we 're trying to determine . We believe these students may have been ... - Are you okay ? - No , actually . We 're three days behind on a deadline . You 'll excuse me if I seem insensitive . What does this have to do with me and this lab ? We believe they were animal-rights activists . That they were killed after they broke in and released animals from a facility much like you have here . So you 're suggesting that a lab animal was responsible ? Well , maybe one that was genetically altered . Do you do any of that sort of work here ? No , Agent Dunham . I told you we only test products . And what 's more , there was no break-in . Doing some cleanup work ? Hundreds of animals in and out of here every week . As I 'm sure you can probably imagine , the cleanup never ends . Mind if I take a look ? Not to be a rude host , but you actually do need a warrant . Understand , we deal with billion-dollar trade secrets and I am obligated to respect my clients ' confidentiality . How would we accomplish that ? Wait . Damn it , how can I concentrate with your running around ? Walter . Are you talking to me ? No . Just thinking out loud . - Hey . Walter . - Hey . Walter , I need you to tell me what exactly you would need to create a genetic hybrid . Like , specific items . So I can see if Robert Swift 's bought any of it . I would need some sodium bicarbonate , and a house in the country . A place to be alone with my thoughts . Some Mahler for the late nights , and time . A lot of time . I know , it 's like he 's on another planet . You 've seen him , he 's been like that all day . But can you focus him ? Focusing Walter is , even at the best of times , just a matter of degrees . - Okay , fine . - Thank you . Hey , Walter , I need you to snap back to Earth for a second and focus on something that isn 't about you . Oh , Peter . I 'm afraid this is about me . About my work . I found this book among my old files . What is this , Walter ? Olivia . - Is this the creature ? - No . But I fear it is quite similar . - Where did you get this ? - I tried to make it , 20 years ago . - Are you saying that you created this ? - Not this one specifically . - My experiments were a failure . - You knew . You knew all along that this was connected to your work . You had information that could help us but you kept it to yourself . My creatures didn 't survive , someone else finished my work . Who , Walter ? Who could have done this ? Twenty years ago , who were you working with ? Kelvin Genetics . We were doing classified work for the U.S. Army . - I need a name , Walter . - Guys ? - Do you remember anybody specific ? - No . - Guys , this body is moving . - What ? They 're still alive . Quick , unzip it . They may be suffocating . - Ugh ! Maggots . - No , not maggots , larvae . - From the creature . - You mean these are baby monsters ? Yes . We must collect them . Peter , Petri dish . - Make it a bucket . - I 'm gonna be sick . - Two buckets . - Walter , how is this even possible ? The stinger . It must carry the eggs . Transfers them to a suitable incubator . You mean it plants the eggs when it stings you ? Yeah . It 's fascinating . Oh , God . Charlie . So far , there have been three sightings in the greater Boston area . Two in Medford and one in Arlington . Authorities advise if you see it or any other wild animal do not try to confront it yourself . Do you hear this ? There 's some kind of mountain lion on the loose . - Mountain lion ? - Yeah . In Boston . Where does a mountain lion come from in Boston ? Maybe it escaped from the zoo . Well , I doubt that , otherwise they would just say so . The mountain lion , also known as a cougar or puma , is found in most ... - Well , baby , that 's why you married me . - Why ? So I can protect you from all the scary things that are out there . - And who 's gonna protect you ? - I told you , it 's just a scrape . You know , bad guy , broken bottle . Nothing I haven 't handled before a dozen times . Who 's that ? - Liv . - Charlie , hey . - What 's up ? - Uh ... - You okay ? - Yeah , Charlie . But you may not be . Electro-conductive gel for the ultrasound . Enough with the suspense , what is it exactly that we 're looking for ? I believe the stinger we found in you may have carried the creature 's embryos . I think this is why the creature didn 't eat you . I think you may be carrying its offspring . Are you trying to tell me that I 'm pregnant ? We 're hoping not . - So ? - Ten times magnification . Is that it ? I 'm afraid so . One small piece of good fortune : At least the creature doesn 't mate in the traditional way . - Thanks , Walter . Great bedside manner . - So , what do we do now ? I don 't know . I can 't simply remove them . They 've already spread throughout his system . Just give me a second . Astrid . Walter . Walter , calm down . Liv , the other victim ... How are these things actually born ? It doesn 't matter because it 's not gonna go that far . Walter , there 's gotta be something that you can do . All right ? Hey , you can 't check out right now , we cannot let this man die . Don 't you think I know that , Peter ? I 'm thinking , damn it . Agent Farnsworth , draw 25 milliliters of blood . - Peter , get some Trichloromide . - What are you gonna do ? Poison them . This is gonna pinch just a little bit . Careful , Peter , it 's highly toxic . If this doesn 't work , how much time do I have ? The last victim we figured 24 hours after he was ... Knocked up . Yeah . So I have about 16 hours . Careful . Okay , get your toy out . Hello ? Hey , Catherine ... Oh , slow down , honey , be careful . Hey , yeah , sorry . Oh , the house ? Yeah , we saw it yesterday . It was perfect . Yeah , exactly what I was looking for . I made a few calls for you . This is what I was able to get the Army to declassify on Kelvin Genetics . Five lab assistants worked with Dr. Bishop and Bell . All of them now in the private sector . None working in biogenetics . - And Robert Swift ? - No connection . I 've been through the missing-persons records a dozen times . - There 's nothing from local hospitals . - You 're thinking there was a fourth ? If they 're out there and impregnated then who knows how many more we 're looking at . Presumably we 'd have heard something by now . Any more sightings ? - Not any within the last 10 hours . - Maybe it 's gone . Maybe it went into the river or died from lack of proper food . Agent Dunham , Peter Bishop 's on line six . - Hey . - It 's bad news . The poison killed the larvae , but also poisoned Charlie 's blood . - Have you spoken to Charlie ? - Yeah . He 's putting on a brave face , but he 's not doing well . Blood pressure 's down , kidneys are failing . - I don 't understand . - The larvae act like parasites . They feed on their host for nutrients . They 're killing him so they can gestate . Did you tell her , Peter , about the blood ? - What blood ? - Walter has a theory . To trick the larvae into self-destructing . How do we do that ? Transfuse Charlie with the creature 's blood . Mix the mother 's blood in . Maybe they 'll think he 's one of their own , stop feeding and die . Which sounds crazy , but he seems to think it 'd work . Okay . Then that 's what we 'll do . - Bye . - What ? We need to find the creature . It 's got three bedrooms so if we wanna have another baby , we 'll be fine . Oh , and the best part about it is it 's got this amazing yard . Oh , it 's even got a tree house for Tuck . Catherine , let me call you back . Tuck ! Tuck , come out of there . Tuck ! Come here ! Medford , Waltham , Newton , and an unconfirmed report of a giant snake out of Watertown . - What are you thinking ? - It doesn 't make sense . I mean , something this big , why aren 't there more sightings ? It 's just a mild sedative . It might make you feel more relaxed . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . I 'm sorry this has happened to you . It 's not your fault . - They didn 't tell you . - Tell me what ? The creature . Where it came from . Astrid , I need a schematic of the sewer . Section E3 and F5 . - You 've had a thought . - Yeah . I think it 's traveling underground . - Here you go . - Thank you . Look at that . All the sightings are near major storm drains . Each one large enough to accommodate the creature . That makes sense . If it 's part tiger , then it would prefer dark . And a python would seek out water . So it 's probable only surfacing to eat or to mate . - What ? - If it 's traveling in the sewer then we have nothing . - It could be anywhere . - It 's okay . - We 're making progress . - No , it 's not okay . You tell Agent Francis it 's okay . I 'll go talk to him . Hang on , hang on , hang on . Hold him down . Hold him down ! - Charlie . - Lift his shirt . They 're getting bigger . When ? Did you get any witness statements ? Can you send me them as soon as you get them ? - Thank you . - Another sighting ? Yeah , this time in a public park off Hawthorn . - Which is nowhere near the other places . - There 's no predictable pattern . This thing could show up anytime , anywhere , and we 'd have no idea . - Hello ? - Agent Dunham . Hey , this is Carl Bussler from MIT . - What can I do for you ? - You said to call if anything came up . - I think maybe something might have . - What is it ? This kid Jonathan hasn 't been in class for the last few days . I don 't know if he was friends with Chris or whatever but he was into all that animal-rights stuff too . Anyway , no one 's seen him . Okay , I 'll check it out . What 's his last name ? Swift . Jonathan Swift . Miss ? You can 't go back there . Agent Dunham . You lied to me . - I did ? - You obstructed the course of an investigation into the deaths of five people . - Will you excuse us for a minute ? - Dr. Swift . You failed to tell me that your son , Jonathan , was at MIT . How is that relevant ? Three of his classmates were torn limb from limb the other night and he hasn 't been seen since . That would be relevant . I don 't know how that happened . My son was not involved . The last time you spoke to him ? - A few days . He 's very busy at school . - Yes , I know . Politically active . Animals First ? He wasn 't too fond of the work you did , was he ? I really can 't say . Is this going somewhere ? Yes , a motive . I believe that he found out about your studies . That your lab was testing on animals , and he and his friends broke in here . But what he didn 't know was that you do much more than just test on animals , you create them . Dangerous genetic hybrids . We 're done here . Any questions , you have to go through my attorney . This thing has already killed five people and infected one of our agents . As we speak , its offspring is growing inside him , killing him . Do you really want his death on your conscience ? Now , your son is out there , maybe injured , maybe infected . And I can help . But you need to help me too . It didn 't kill five people . Excuse me ? It was seven . - Hello ? - Hey . Swift broke . He admitted the hybrid came from his laboratory . Apparently he was collaborating with a geneticist called Cameron Deglmann . - Oh . Well , where is this guy ? Dead . He was at the lab along with Swift 's son when the students released the creature . So , what is the link to Kelvin Genetics ? Well , that 's the interesting part . You got a pen ? Good news . That was Olivia . Swift confessed . This monster has nothing to do with your work . - What ? - Swift was working with a geneticist . For years he was pursuing this work . A Cameron Deglmann ? - Deglmann . Of course . - Whoa , whoa , who 's Deglmann ? Pioneer in hybridization . Quite brilliant . It was his work that inspired my research in the first place . It never even crossed your mind he might be involved ? - He had a very forgettable face . - In the " more good news " column Olivia got the combination of animals that went into the hybrid . - Oh , go on . - Heloderma suspectum . Yes , a venomous lizard native to North America . Also called the Gila monster . - Megarhyssa macrurus . - Parasitic wasp , interesting . Desmodus rotundus and ... - Wait . Did you say Desmodus rotundus ? - Yeah , why ? What is that ? It 's a type of bat . Of course . Why didn 't I think of it before ? Their immune system . Makes it a perfect candidate for genetic hybridization . - I 'm lost . - Bats have a unique immune system . They can carry hundreds of diseases without being affected . That same system makes it possible for the creature to mature without rejecting its various parts . Bat was the missing ingredient that allowed the creature to survive . So now that you know what it is , can you help Charlie ? No . We 'll still need a specimen of the creature 's blood . Okay . Okay , well , we know what it 's made of . We know that it moves through the sewers . So can 't we , I don 't know , like , bait it or something ? Just so I 'm clear , are you suggesting that we go into the sewers and wait for this thing to eat us ? - Well , no ... - Yes . - Yes . - Only , no . - No ? - It 's not interested in food . No . We do have something that it is interested in . Bats are a highly maternal species . They 're quite protective of their young . Are you saying that we can lure this thing by dangling those larvae in front of it ? Yes , but no . Oh , great . This again . It wouldn 't be necessary to be in front of it . Bats are capable of seeking out their offspring from miles away . We 've determined it 's traveling through the sewers . So we need to lure it from a central location . Wonderful . We 're gonna antagonize this thing into chasing us , then what ? Now that I have a better idea of its biological makeup I think I can kill it . Assuming that you can provide us with 50-caliber incendiary rounds , Agent Dunham . Well , that 's not exactly FBI standard issue , Walter . Are you sure about this ? If my theory is correct , and the bat traits are dominant in the creature , then , yes , I believe we can successfully lure it . Whether we can survive the encounter is the more intriguing question . Okay , we missing anything ? - Can you carry these , son ? - Sure thing . Be careful . You must be very gentle with them . Right , because we wouldn 't wanna hurt the monster babies . You need anything ? Shot of JD and a chaser of beer would be nice . You know , hunting this thing in the sewers it 's not a good idea , Liv . You got a better idea ? Yeah . Don 't get hurt for me . Well , that 's not really very fair considering you would do the same thing for me . I 'll be back soon . Promise . You will call me if his condition changes . I will . We ready ? Ready as I 'll ever be . - Walter , let 's go . - Be right there , son . Based on the sewer map , this will make a fine infiltration point . Nothing to see here , ma 'am . Just routine maintenance . Smells great down here . So , what 's next , Walter ? There 's an intersection a hundred feet down here . That will conduct the sound most effectively . Nearly there . The larvae are creating a vibration . Frequencies of sound detectable by bats and hopefully our guest of honor . Well , now I know what it feels like to be live bait . Hey , come on , let 's get in position . - Hello ? - You just get in ? Hi . I thought it might be you . I just got in from the market . I ran into Jody . What is it ? Oh , she just told me a really funny joke . - Tell me . - So the patient goes to his doctor and he says : " Doctor , if I give up wine , women and song will I live longer ? " And the doctor says , " Well , no but it 'll feel longer . " You don 't think that 's funny . - I do . - No , you don 't . Are you gonna be home for dinner ? I don 't know . Okay , all right , well , I will see you when you get home . And I love you , babe . Even more for laughing at that joke . - I love you too . - Bye-bye . Frightening situation like this , two things occur to me . The first is a song I used to sing to Rufus . Our dog . When he was young , he used to have night terrors . Van Amburgh is the man Who goes to all the shows He steps into the lion 's cage And tells them all he knows He puts his head in the lion 's mouth Hey , Walter . You think we could wait down here to be mauled in silence , please ? - Of course . - So , what was the second thing ? - Hm ? - You said two things occurred to you . The second thing . I need to tinkle . Could either of you direct me to the facilities ? The facilities ? You 're in the sewer , Walter . - Your knee-deep in the facilities . - Quite right . Excuse me . Don 't say that I never take you anywhere . Hey ! Open this up right now . I 'm afraid I can 't do that . No one else is going to get hurt . This thing is a mistake , and I 'm going to correct it . Alone . Walter ! Hey , Walter , you open this gate right now . You were right , Peter . I live in a society . And I need to clean up after myself . Walter , this is not your fault . You did not do this . No , but I could have . I pursued the same science ... You 're not prepared for this , that thing could tear you apart . Yes , you 're right . I almost forgot . I 've already considered that possibility . Walter , is that the Trichloromide ? No , no , no ! What are you doing ? That 's gonna kill you . Should the creature consume me , it will only be poisoning itself . Afterwards , you remove its blood and save Agent Francis . Walter , listen to me , I don 't want you to do this . Okay ? Do you hear what I 'm saying ? I do not want you to do this . Should I live , there 's an antidote in the lab which I should ingest within the hour . Time is of the essence . Walter , Walter , stop right there . Walter , come back here ! Stop right now ! Walter ! Van Amburgh is the man Who goes to all the shows Who goes to all the shows He steps right into the lion 's cage Selfish son of a bitch . If he lives through this , I am gonna kill him myself . The hyena in the next cage Most terrible to relate Got awfully hungry the other night And ate up his female mate He 's a most ferocious beast Don 't go near him , little boys For when he 's mad he swings his tail And makes an awful noise Oh , dear God . Walter ! Walter ! Are you okay ? Yes . Although when I mentioned that the poison would kill me within the hour did either of you happen to notice the time ? That 's it , then ? Now we wait . Prepare Agent Francis for the ultrasound . What ? Sonia and I , we 've been talking a lot lately about having a baby . Sorry , I gotta jelly you up . You were right . What you said before about the consequences . I don 't think of them , never have . Don 't know if I can . It 's not who I am . I know . But you were brave today . Yeah . Check in on Agent Francis . Let 's look in on our little friends . It didn 't work . Ever the pessimist . Look . They 're dying . What happens now ? Now you crap them out . - Hey , you 're home . - Yeah . You feel good . - So do you . - Mm-hm .

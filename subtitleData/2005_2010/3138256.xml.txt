 I didn 't want to ... I 'm not in control . I know . Tell me you love me . I love you . Ross , darling . What ? You 're afraid I 'll go deaf . Get up , I 'm driving you to school . You got an other one ? You 're a minor , it 's not legal for you to get a tatoo and now you have two ! Three ? Where is the third one ? - Why are you so pissed at everyone ? - Not everyone . Ok , me . Why are you so pissed at me ? You turned up at my door step . I take you in , feed you , cloth you , send you to school . But I suck , uh ? - I mean , I must really ... - You left me . After mom ... The victim of a Baghdad car bombing . We did transplants , and facial reconstructions . This triathlete was told he 'd never compete again . For some women , bigger is better . What these people have in common is that they have each in some level , and for variant reasons , altered themselves . But where is the threshold ? When is it ok to intervene in God 's work ? This question is the very corner stone of bioethics and we 're gonna spend the rest of the semester dealing with it . Come on , Will , I mean it . I 'm a bartender and a dropout . - You 're a professor . - And a surgeon . How can you take me seriously ? - What makes you think I take you seriously ? - Do you ? - You 're not kidding ? - Why are you with me ? - You 're different . - In what ? When your whole life is planed out for you while you 're still in the womb , it kinda kills the mystery . And then you came along and you were ... - unexpected . - Unexpected ? The one choice my father didn 't make for me . I gotta to run . - Hum , we 're still on for dinner ? - 8 o 'clock ? Make it 8 : 30 , I have to go to the lab for a few hours . While we are on the subject , why are you with me ? You 're not entirely uncharming . It 's not insulting . - I 'm 16 . - You 're 15 ! And quit being melodramatic . - She 's weird . - She 's not that weird ! I don 't need a baby-sitter . Don 't think of me as a baby-sitter , think of me as prison guard . I brought * * * . I think there 's a pretty good chance the grant could come true . The institute indicates it 's a done deal . And I heard Paris is great in spring and ... - You 're not happy ? - Of course I 'm happy . Because I think you should come with me . - I can 't . - Why not ? - I have a job . - Jaime ! - A life . - We 're talking Paris . And I have reponsabilities . - Did I mention it 's Paris ? - I 'm pregnant . Yeah , that 's what I said . I don 't want you to ... I just ... I know this is not something you just spring on someone ... Except for the part where that 's exactly what I 'm doing to you right now and ... I know you 're in a place where you can 't even think about it ... And god , I 'm only 24 ! It 's not , I mean ... I said to myself that 's the only one thing to do but ... - I will never be ... - 5 months 14 days ... That 's how long we 've been dating . Jaime , if somebody had asked me 5 months and 15 days ago , if I believed in love at first sight , I would have said I absolutely did not . And the very next day , I would have been proved them all . - Will ... - Marry me . So I 'm thinking Coletrane if it 's a boy . Billy if it 's a girl . You don 't have to do this you know . Actually , I 'm pretty sure you have to name them . - I mean you don 't have to ... - I know , and I 'm still asking ... So what does that tell you ? Jaime ? Jaime ? There 's internal bleeding . Extensive crush injuries in right arm and both legs . - She 's coming up ! - I need 5 milligrams of * * . - Will ? - You 're gonna be ok , baby . We 're gonna put you back to sleep . It 's gonna be alright . I promise . It 's gonna be ok ... Doctor Anthros , surely a more conventional hospital ... - Did you assemble the team ? - They 're in the O.R. but I don 't understand why ... You don 't have to ! Multiple compound radial and humeral fractures on the right arm . Severed brachial artery . - Right arm is a shredder . We 're looking at complete amputation on both legs . There are vascular damages , it 's catastrophic . - Lost the fetal heartbeat . - Doctor Anthros ? BP is falling . 80 systolic . - Prep her . - Doctor Anthros ? Do it ! Why didn 't somebody stop him ? Sorry John , we can 't . He has full clearance and we didn 't have the authority to stop him . It 's the price you pay for working with a so-called genius . 'Cause he must have left his I.Q. in the car . Debriding the humeral nerve , radial nerve appears to be intact . Should I intervene ? No . This operation and this patient doesn 't officially exist . We have deniability , it 's a freebee . We can always terminate later if need be . Meanwhile get Jae . See if you can track him down . Forgive me Father for I have sinned . The doctor . Did you kill him ? It was like a ride at Disneyland . - Which one ? - I 've never been . I 'll take you . You 'll love it . It 's all ... fat people with fat children walking along aimlessly . Too stupid to know the difference . Do you miss it ? The way things were . If I could remember , I 'm sure I would . Do I remind you of her ? Yes , * * * . Tell me you love me . - Jaime ? - What happened ? You had an accident . You 're ok . My baby ? What about the baby ? Oh God ! There was no permanent damage . You 'll be able to get pregnant again . Why can 't I feel my legs ? Ok , Jaime , I need to tell you something . What 's happening to me ? I need to tell about what I did , and you need to listen to me . - I can 't feel my arm . - Listen to me , Jaime . Both your legs and your arm had to be replaced . Also , your right ear and right eye . Molecular machines , intrasites , have been substituted for one eight of your blood cells . Now you should have lacerations bone deep , all over your face . But the intrasites are healing you . At an exponential rate . All of you , we 're making you better . It was a dream . The bionics enhance * * * human strength . And then some . - What have you done to me ? - Jaime . - Why did you do this to me ? - You were going to die . Sir . Borned Jaime Wells Sommers , Van Horn , Iowa , February 23rd 1983 . Mother deceased , cancer . Father still a hawkeye . She 's was enrolled at Berkeley until last semester which is when her sister began to attend classes at the Dolton school for the deafs . She 's clean except for a sealed court record from 1998 . What 's in it ? - It 's sealed . - Unseal it . I 'm working on it . I think she 's a good candidate . Well let 's pretend I 'm soliciting opinions , why ? She 's stable . I 've put up an old Minnesota multiphysic personality inventory . I liked what I saw . Plus the situation whith her sister shows loyalty . And she 's smart . I found an old I.Q. test . - How did she do ? - A little better than you , sir . Jae , can you train her ? Well , the last one we screened , tested , made the psych evaluations and she was a soldier . Look where that got us . We 've always talked about non-military applications . Here is our chance . Your opinion is invalid , you 're too close to the subject . There 's from the guy who played house with the last one . Let 's get fresh data , I want you to sit her down . Alright . Yeah , I once had a wolf . And a wolf only makes a good pet , if he thinks he 's a dog . And your girlfriend , we 're keeping her here against her will . How long until she realizes that no one can make or do anything against her will . You 're talking about killing a human . I 'm talking about killing a wolf . You know what scares me about you ? Your father . He seemed normal too . If I 'm anything like my father , you just made a big mistake . Alright , I have to get you to rehab before ... rehabilitation . I 'm not the one performing human experiments and keeping people prisonner . You rehabilitate yourself . Booh . - I 'm Ruth . - I 'm pissed . Good . We 're here to talk about our feelings . How do you feel about me being captured against my will ? I was speaking editorially . Actually , we 're here to talk about your feelings . Something no one seems to have any regard for . Curve balls will do that . You can have all the contingency plans you like and then someone goes into something like this and then we all have to stay after school ... And talk about our feelings . - Your feelings . - Right . After all , feelings are what got us here in the first place . You like to draw ? - True or false ? - I have a sister . She 's staying with your landlady . She thinks you 're skiing in Vail . This is where you stayed . It looks nice . You had fun . Except for the part where Will enjured his arm skiing into a tree . Does this mean I 'll be going home at some point ? It means we have a contengency plan , should you be going home at some point ? We also have a plan , should you not ? True or false ? You can 't teach an old dog new tricks . You would have done the same thing . You never met my wife , did you ? For two years I watched her die in a hospital while they disassembled her . And the whole time I knew all I had to do to save her was to bring her here , but saving my wife was not the mission . Ruth said she 's stable . How long until she 's combat ready ? She 's a civilian . Everyone has to sing for their supper around here , Will . Haven 't you figured that out yet ? How long until the rest of her implants come online ? - She likes to draw . - I don 't care . I think you 'll care about this . Who did they bury ? I mean , did you ever see the body ? - Did you show this to anybody else ? - Just you . Keep it that way . I can 't protect you in here . - But once you 're on the outside ... - Why should I trust you ? Because I 'm the only one you can trust . Go back to your life like none of this ever happened . - I 'll work it out with them . - What about you ? Go , now ! Alright , so I 'll have those faxed over to you by Friday afternoon . And , we 're still on for that meeting tomorrow ? Okay , good . Yeah ? Mummy ? There is a lady out there running very fast . Like as fast as the car ! Sweety , what did I tell you about making things up ? I thought it was cool that a girl could do that . That 's all . - Let her go . - What the hell did you do ? You want her , right ? For the program , leave her alone . I 'll make her understand what 's at stake , - just let me have time to ... - Time to what ? Letting her go is not a bad idea . If you want her loyalty , give her freedom . Or the illusion of freedom . Alright . Everybody , stand down . - You 're making a mistake . - Listen to me . The accident wasn 't an accident . According to the autopsy , the driver 's neck was broken an hour before the crash . Which means someone else was driving that car . We need to find out who . Jaime , it 's Will . Jaime , if you 're there , pick up the phone , I need to talk to you . Jaime , please . There 's so many these things I want to say to you . So many things , I can 't say on the phone . There are things I need to tell you about . Before they happen . Nice of you to show up . I 'm sorry . What for ? For leaving and not telling you first . How was skiing ? It was fine . Don 't lie to me ! Where were you ? I can 't tell you . You failed me . Coffee . It 's no smoking . What are you ? A forest ranger ? Something like that . It must be scary . Alone in the forest , just you and the animals . Not if they know who 's in charge . Hey ! Wait up ! Guard ! We both know you 're working in the Supermax Prison . A thousand feet below Florence . We both know this is the place where they stick people when they outlive their usefulness . - I don 't know who you are . - If you don 't do exactly what I say , I 'm gonna carve your wife Barbara like Venus de Milo . Baby , it 's me . Do what he says . How did you do it ? Do you know what they call creatures that can live comfortably in environments considered lethal , say , for instance , a thousand feet below the Earth 's surface ? - How did you do it ? - Extremophiles . I 'll do an impression of one for you , ready ? - How ... did you do ... - What ? - How did I do what ? - That Sarah Corvus is still alive . And you come all the way here to tell me that ? Let me do another impression for you . Impression of a man who 's been stabbed in the back , stripped of his rights and thrown in a hole like a dog . Sarah Corvus is a time bomb , we both know it . Well , time bombs only matter to those who have time . Good bye , Jae . Please give my regards to Will . Tell him Daddy says hello . Guards ? If I may make an observation , you seem way too innocent and sweet to be behind a bar . And you should be out there with the rest of them . Finally , I 'm not the only person who feels that way . - What can I get you ? - Beer . - On the house . - Thank you . Don 't I know you ? We met very briefly . We didn 't even actually meet . - Where ? - Guess . - Are you alright ? - Yeah . - Let me take a look at it . - No , it 's ok . Are you ok ? Come on , your husband will never know . * * * . Are you alright ? Let me help you . Just breathe . It 's like that , the first time the ear and eye inputs come online . It 's too much information . We have to learn how to focus it . And turn it off on our will . You 're a fast healer . The intrasites are doing their job . Who are you ? Who are you ! Tell everyone Sarah Corvus says hello . Yo ? You 're looking for something ? You need something ? Uh ? Come here , baby . I got what you need . Please . Please don 't . Don 't . - Are you ok ? - Tell me what you put in my head ? - Jaime . - I almost killed a man . I didn 't even know what I was doing . What did you put in my head ? Microscopic chips have been implanted in your cerebral cortex . My father developped a technology for the military . The program was meant to help amputees in the Gulf . Of course he saw the combat application immediately . You made me into a soldier ! You 're hardwired for very highly specialized warfare , yes . I was gonna kill him . I would have ... But you didn 't , you 're still in control . - And with a proper training ... - Training ? Jaime , we 're the only ones that can protect you . - Let me protect you . - How can you protect me if you 're scared at me ? I never meant for any of this to touch you , I didn 't . I just ... I couldn 't bare to lose you . That isn 't even me . Yes , it is . - Hey . - Hey . I have to get back to Becca . - I can 't keep leaving her like this . - Jaime . What do you people do anyway ? - It 's complicated . - Try me . The world is further along than everyone wants to admit . Technology is at a point where science-fiction isn 't fiction anymore . We keep that technology from getting into the wrong hands . Who gets to decide right from wrong ? What about Sarah Corvus ? Where does she figure in all this ? Where did you hear that name ? Where did you hear that name , Jaime ? Will ? Will ? - Sorry . - Just hold on , ok ? - Where is she ? - I don 't know . I need everyone . Time out . The intrasites in our blood can filter out any impurities in our lungs . - Fringe benefit of being a freak . - What do you want from me ? Honestly , I 'm not sure ... - Jogging partner ? - Who are you ? Without being too melodramatic about the whole thing , I 'm Sarah Corvus ... the first bionic woman . Tada ! So what did they replace ? I figured the eyes and the ears . What else ? Me , they did both arms , both legs , only one eye . Anthros wasn 't sure about the optical interface . Neither was his son . So I did the other one myself . Part of my chest too . I 'm cutting away all the parts of me that are weak . Time in . You only have one bionic arm . You should really do something about that . You gotta have to do a little better than that . How am I doing now ? Not bad . Not bad at all . We have a 33 year old male , caucasian , a gunshot victim , wound to shoulder . Request assistance from Mercy General . Will gonna make it ? Miss Sommers . - Just wanted to get a look at you . - Who are you ? You have 50 million dollars worth of my property inside you , so I guess you could say I 'm your landlord . What do you want from me ? I don 't know , maybe you died 3 days ago and you just haven 't realized that yet . Is that a threat ? There 's no free agents , Miss Sommers . Sooner or later you 're gonna have to make a choice , it goes something like this , heads you lose , tails you die . Welcome to the game . Hey ! If we do this , whatever this is , we do it on my terms . If that 's not okay with you , I know what I 'm capable of now . So you send whoever you send , and I 'll bury one guy after the next . You understand me ? By the way , Sarah Corvus says hello . Tell Jae we have a candidate . What are you doing ? I haven 't seen the moon in a 1023 days . It hasn 't changed , let 's go . We have work to do . To be continued ...

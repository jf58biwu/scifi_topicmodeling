 Over the last 60 years 4400 people have been abducted All at once they were returned With no memory of where they 've been They haven 't aged a day And some have returned with new abilities All are trying to reconnect with a life interrupted We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . Previously on the 4400 ... This is Isabelle . You are the stewards of the future . Your daughter is the Rosetta stone for understanding what happened to the 4400 . Are you my mother ? Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging . The only way for you to live is for me to die . Don 't you understand who you are , what you 're here to do ? P. I. Promicin Inhibitor . We did it to them , Tom . We made them sick . We are in a war . This is a message from the Nova group . The second demonstration of our capabilities is planned for October 19th . You think I 'm just going to write you a check ? I need it tomorrow . We couldn 't even handle one when she walked right in here and attacked the place . Now there 's a whole team of assassins out there all with abilities ? I gave you money to start a defensive arm for the center in case the government ever came after us again . You lied to me , Daniel . You never said anything about killing people . You sold us out . You did the right thing by calling us , Shawn . You 're a hero . - I 'm Tyler . - Maia Where are we ? This is where they altered us ... gave me the ability to create the world we 've been living in for the last eight years . People see her , they see a woman , and they might forget that , inside , she 's just a little girl . I 'm glad she has you around to be a friend . You are ticklish . Cut it out . It bothers me . It bothers you ? It didn 't seem to bother you a few minutes ago . - I could hold you like this . - Oh , you could hold me like this ? Really ? What about that ? Don 't answer it . I have to . I 'm still the boss around here . - Richard , hey . - Sorry to bother you . I was waiting for you down in your office . Oh , you know ... Yeah , sorry . I 'm just running a little late this morning . What 's up ? Before Lily ... Before she passed , she asked if I 'd take over her job at the foundation . The healing work you do was really important to her . I remember . I ... I 'm glad to have you aboard . What do you need ? A better head for numbers . I 've been trying to decipher these financial reports . There 's some pretty big cash payments . You signed the transfers . I figured you might remember what they were for . No idea . I 'm sorry , no idea . Just checking . See you soon . Maybe we should tell him . No , no , I don 't think so . We just ... we 've just got to be more careful from now on , okay ? Thank you for doing this , Thomas . I know an open house at the center isn 't your favorite Sunday activity . Hey , I love a good barbecue . You 've been spending a lot of time here . If this place is important to you , it 's important to me . I don 't believe you , but I love you for saying it . And don 't be nervous . Everyone here 's going to love you , too . So , help me out here , Tom . You say you love Alana , and yet she 's a 4400 , and you 're an NTAC agent . I mean , if I were you , and I really loved her , well , I 'd quit that job . First of all , you 're not me . You don 't know anything about me . You don 't know anything about this relationship , and frankly , I doubt you know much about NTAC . You did almost kill us all . Thanks for the input , Ryan . Nice chatting with you . I am so sorry , Thomas . He 's usually not that rude . We 've been here an hour . I 've had four conversations like that . You think we can call it a day ? Alana ? I didn 't realize your Thomas was Tom Baldwin . Remember me ? Heather Tobey . Nice to see a friendly face . How are you ? I couldn 't be better . Tom was my hero . You mean Heather was one of your assignments ? Yeah , about eight months ago . That was when I first got my ability . Heather , you seem great . What are you up to ? I teach at the school here now . It 's a good match , huh ? Finally found a place where they won 't run me out on the rails for being a 4400 . And now Alana and I are going to be working together . Isn 't that cool ? I 've been ... offered a job ... working with the children at the school . But I haven 't decided if I 'm going to take it yet . I blew the surprise , didn 't I ? So help me out here . Who 's Amy again ? Is she a 4400 ? Everyone in my class is a 4400 . She wants me to come over tomorrow . It 's not a huge deal . Oh , it 's not ? Well , I guess when you put it like that , then there 's no way I can say no . Where 's your sweater ? I left it upstairs . Quickly run and get it . It 's freezing by the water . We 're going to miss the ferry . You 're going to forget me . Excuse me ? You 're going to forget me . I saw it . Maia , do you mind explaining that , because , frankly , it sounds a little creepy . It 's okay . It 's not your fault . Maia , listen to me . I would never forget you . Not ever ! Come on , you know that , don 't you ? I 'll be right back . Maia , come on . Come on , sweetie , we 're going to miss the boat , literally . - Maia , come here right now . - Mommy , it 's okay . Who the hell are you ? How did you get in here ? I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean to upset you . I was just knocking on your door when ... Maia came upstairs . It 's so great . - Tell her . - Tell me what ? Ms. Skouris , my name is Sara . Sara Rutledge . I 'm Maia 's sister . He was my dog . I know . He slept on your bed , every night . Right until he died . You really lived in my house ? 22 White Oak lane , Crescent City . My room was at the top of the stairs . I know . It was always your room . Mom and dad kept it all the same , just for you . They missed you so much . Maia , I need you to give me some time alone with Sara . Did daddy teach you to play poker ? We played for tootsie rolls . Maia ... I think your mom needs a word with me , sweetie . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to sandbag you . I was going to leave a note . I 've been trying to find you for years . Every phone number out of date , every letter comes back " return to sender . " Guyana , the Ivory Coast ... I 've been hard to find . Hard to find ? I didn 't know if you were alive or dead . Which , I 'm guessing , is ... is why you never told Maia about me . I 'm sorry , what was I supposed to say ? " Sweetheart , you have an older sister , but it doesn 't seem like she 's terribly interested in meeting you ? " I 'm sorry . I ... I should have called first . I just felt like ... I needed to do this in person . I just ... want to know her . That 's all . You think it 's that easy ? There are a lot of people who do anything to get close to a 4400 . Until you can prove to me that you are who you say you are , you 're not seeing my daughter again . I understand , I 'm willing to take a DNA test . It 's a good start . You didn 't even tell me you were thinking about teaching , that the possibility existed . To be honest , I was avoiding it . I know how you feel about the center . No , I 'm fine with the center , they 're not fine with me . What about your gallery ? I can still do all the buying , and ... Tina can handle sales . Okay , I 'm sorry if this seems just sudden , I ... I told them about my ability at the center , and they thought they could use it at the school . You 're going to use your ability ? Don 't you think that 's why we came back here with these gifts ? To help other people ? Yeah , yeah , it sounds great . I just didn 't think that ... I mean , does it even work with other people ? I did an experiment with Heather . We went to Paris for lunch . Don 't worry , I don 't think my batteries run out . I 'll save my best work for you . I promise . I 'd like to thank you for ... agreeing to be a part of our ... experiment , I guess you 'd call it . We 've never tried a healing this large , but we think you 'll all be very happy with the results . Before we begin , I 'd like to say that this foundation was started by my late wife , Lily Tyler . I 'm proud to be carrying on her work . She 's the reason why we 're all here today . Well , her , and the man I 'm about to introduce to you ... Shawn Farrell . Thank you . Okay ... First off , kids , I promise this is not gonna hurt . Listen , I 'd like to ask everyone here a favor . When you leave here today , and you will be leaving the hospital today . Please tell anyone that asks that a 4400 made you better , made your children better . Because we 're not bogeymen . We 're here to help . So , let 's get this thing started . Traitor ! You betrayed your own kind . Next time it won 't be paint ! You okay ? It 's in her file . Maia 's parents had a baby five years after she disappeared , and her name was Sara . So it is possible . No word at all for two years , and then she just shows up ? You think she 's the real deal ? - I don 't know , maybe . - What does your gut tell you ? Oh , it tells me that she 's not going to see Maia again until the DNA tests comes back . Smart gut . Her name is Lindsey Hammond . She disappeared on November 23 , 1979 . You know , just once , I wish a 4400 would smile for their picture . Is that too much to ask ? Since her return , she 's been living with her stepfather . - Until yesterday , that is . - What , she 's missing ? Her stepfather thinks she ran away . Take a drive out to her house , see if we need to be worried . That just came in . The attack at the hospital this morning wasn 't random . Somehow you 've become a target of the Nova group . Any idea why ? Two months ago ... Someone called me . They were trying to raise money to start a defensive wing of the 4400 . I made a couple of contributions . You gave money to the Nova group ? Shawn , they murdered half a dozen people . That was after . Do you really think I would have given them money if I thought they would hurt anybody ? When they came back asking for more , I said no . You got the money from the foundation , didn 't you ? That 's what all those signatures were for . You diverted money from my wife 's foundation to a terrorist group ? Richard , it was a mistake . I know that . Don 't you think I know that ? I 'll serve to you . We have to try to keep it going for as long as we can . Okay ? Maia . Where 's Maia ? She 's at a friend 's house , a girl from the class . Why ? Preliminary DNA came back . Negative match . Sara isn 't Maia 's sister . Where 's Maia ? They 're in the yard . Is ... is everything okay ? Maia ! - She left . - Where did she go ? She went with that lady , her sister . Her picture 's already on the wire . An amber alert 's been issued . - We 'll find her , Diana . - I know we will . We 're tapped into every surveillance camera in the city downstairs . We 're monitoring every tollbooth , every intersection we can . If Sara shows up on any of them , we can be there in minutes . You 're going to keep an eye on things yourself , right ? - Yeah , yeah , you got it . - Okay . Tom , what did the lab say ? Nothing good . They ran the fingerprints from your apartment , and the DNA samples against every known database . No names came up . So she has Maia . We have no idea who she is . She said I was going to forget her . Mom really kept my room just like I left it ? Sure she did . She always believed that you were going to come home . Maia , can I ask you a question ? Do you see the future more clearly since you stopped taking the inhibitor ? Well ... At first , I couldn 't control it . I thought I was going crazy . But now , I can see the future , more when I want to . It doesn 't really sneak up on me anymore . Not much , anyway . That 's great ! You 're learning to focus your ability . What if I asked you to predict something ... right now ? Wait . We can go now . You are a very special girl . What do you think ? This is your house ? I bought it so I can stay in Seattle . We 've spent enough time apart , don 't you think ? Come on . Let me show you the inside . There 's a surprise . Oh , my gosh ! It 's just like my old room . I told you mom kept it the same . Else how would I know ? Sorry to interrupt ... Hoping I could have a word . Matthew ... Come on in . What 's on your mind ? I was brought into this organization by Jordan Collier . I didn 't always know what he had in mind for it , but I did know that he was a man of experience and vision . Six months after I came aboard , he died . My new boss was a 19-year-old boy . This is about Shawn ? He 's overwhelmed , Richard . Running this center requires substantive decisions , decisions that he 's not qualified to make . Now , you , on the other hand , you were an officer . You led men into battle ... Stop . Shawn runs things here . I am not interested in a palace coup . I am not talking about getting rid of him . I 'm talking about power sharing . The two of you make decisions together . It 's a way of helping him , giving him the benefit of your experience . - This is all very flattering . - I 'm not trying to flatter you . I 'm trying to keep this movement alive . Think about it . And before you say no , I want you to tell me , could you , under any circumstances , see yourself inadvertently funding a terrorist attack ? Look familiar ? Maia 's been drawing it a lot the last few days . Are you sure ? I mean , it 's all through the margins of her journals . I 've never seen it before , but she likes butterflies . It might just be a doodle . Did you find anything else , anything we can use ? It 's hard to say . I mean , it 's all stream of consciousness . You know , predictions about big events right next to tiny things in her everyday life ... And there 's no dates . I did find out how I 'm going to die . Yeah , that was interesting . Oh , don 't worry . It 's actually kind of cool . She did mention a friend 's house . Just referred to the mom , though , Mrs. Paspalis . Amy Paspalis ? That 's the house she was taken from . Great , show us that page . Spooky . I could spend the rest of my career working on these things . Come on , Marco , just ... Here . " Mommy 's come to pick me up from Ms. Paspalis ' house , But I 'm already gone . " " I 'm in a circle with Tyler Downing . " Tyler Downing ? Isn 't he a 4400 ? He goes to school with Maia . I told you , I didn 't do anything to Maia . I swear ! Look , nobody thinks that you did anything . I just need you to try and remember . Now , did she ever talk to you about a circle ? Did she ever mention having visions about the two of you ? No , I said already 10 times . - I 'm not lying ... - Ma 'am . I know you 're worried about your kid . You 're scaring the crap out of my brother . Diana ... There 's nothing here . There 's no sign of Maia or the woman . " I 'm in the circle with Tyler Downing . " Tyler 's here , so where is Maia ? I don 't know . Maybe if we knew what circle she was talking about . Is it a street ? Barnaby Circle ? There 's a Circle Park ... Well , we need to check them all , cause she 's trying to tell me how to find her . Sara ? Is my mom coming to pick me up soon ? Sara ? Sara , the door won 't open . Sara ? You can yell all you want . She won 't come . She never does . Who are you ? I 'm Lindsey . I 'm a part of her collection . We all are . Now you are , too . All of us are 4400s . What is she going to do to us ? Sell us to the highest bidder , do experiments , I mean , who knows ? It doesn 't matter . We 're not going to let it come to that . Hello . That was incredible . Hi . Oh , hi , Thomas . I didn 't hear you come in . Any word about Maia ? Sorry to invade your house , Tom . Alana and I were just practicing . I think I might take that job at the school . Heather and I were just trying something . Don 't be shy about it . Alana just took me back to the year I disappeared . We just watched Richard Nixon fly away from the White House after he resigned . That 's remarkable , huh ? Well , Alana 's an amazing woman . She certainly is . Are you all right , Thomas ? Fine . I 'm just ... I 'm just worried for Diana . She 's strong . And so are you . After Heather leaves , you want me to take you somewhere ? It might calm you down some . No , I think I 'm just going to go to sleep . Hit the investigation fresh in the morning . So things are going well between you and Shawn ? Yeah , I think so . We 're having lots of sex . Has he said " I love you " yet ? Do you think he should have ? Try this . It would be a way to gauge the level of his involvement . Men can do things with their bodies entirely unrelated to their hearts and minds . Shawn likes me . It 's real . Good . Shawn 's going to be having a difficult time these next few days . He 's going to have some decisions to make . You need to help guide him toward the right choice . You want me to use him ? Use him ? What does that even mean ? You 're getting close to Shawn , right ? So he 'll value your advice . That 's a relationship . That 's two people trusting each other . I guess . What do you want me to say to him ? Just the truth . A leader should never be afraid to ask for help . It 's not a sign of weakness . It 's a display of strength . Wear that . Hey , kid ... You have to try to be quiet , okay ? I just want to go home . We all do , but crying is not going to help . Listen , we can do stuff they can 't . That 's why they want us . But maybe we can use it against them . Maybe we could figure out a way to get us out of here . Everyone , tell me what you can do , okay ? My sister and me , we can make water move . Back and forth . Our teacher says we can make dis-fusion happen . Diffusion . Yeah . We have to be together to do it , though . What about you , kid ? I do stuff with electricity . Currents . I can make machines in my kitchen stop working . Okay , good , that will come in handy . I can see things . Things that are going to happen . Really ? That 's awesome . Can you tell if they 're going to keep us here ? Are they going to let us go ? Come on , tell us . We 're not going to be here long . Why , do we get to go home ? I don 't think so . Sorry I asked . Listen , I don 't know about the rest of you , but I 'm going to try to figure out a way to get us out of here . So are you guys up for it ? No , let me go ! Stop ! Let me go ! Stop it ! Let me go ! Help me ! Let me go ! Help ! Stop it ! Let me go ! No ! Tyler Downing wasn 't home when his sister got back from her waitressing shift last night . My god , that 's the third 4400 kid missing . No , try five . Olivia and Duncan Germaine 's parents thought they went on a camping trip with their youth group . Turns out they never showed . Tom , update me here . What are we doing to find this woman ? Well , Maia 's journal said she was inside the circle with Tyler Downing . We 've checked out every street with the name " circle " in it . Skyline circle park , Circle Theater on First Hill . And there 's nothing yet . What about the reservoirs ? They 're basically circular . We 've already looked . There 's a prayer circle scheduled this morning in Denny Park . Maybe there . It 's over here . Hey , I thought you could use a jolt . Thanks . Didn 't get much sleep last night . Any , actually . This helps . You were up all night ? You should go lie down in the theory room for an hour . Tom ... Diana , you all right ? Look . " I 'm in the circle ... " I don 't believe this . I tell you the truth ... and you use it to kick me out . No , Shawn . I 'm just talking about helping you . You 've got an impossible job . Jordan Collier left me in charge of this place . For the past year and a half , it has been my entire life . So thank you for the offer , but I am good . The center has a board of directors , Shawn . And Collier 's appointment of you is subject to their ongoing approval . They approved it because that 's what Jordan wanted , Matthew . Frankly , if Jordan was here , his thoughts on succession might change if he knew you bankrolled an attack on the United States government . You 've made yourself , and this place , a target for terrorists . Shawn ... When you got sick from the inhibitor , you asked me to pinch-hit for you . It 's like that . You need help . You 're talking like you 're offering me a choice . - I am . - Really ? Because right now , it sounds like a threat . Tyler , you have to talk to us . If we get out of the house , can you make it so their cars can 't start ? No , I 'm not helping . Didn 't you see what they did to that other girl ? They took her away ! I don 't want to go away . You will . We all will if we don 't do something . Lindsey ... Lindsey , you okay ? Who are you ? What did they do to you ? Maia , do you want to come with me , please ? It 's okay , sweetie , it 's not so bad . I promise . Help ! Tyler ! Duncan ! Please ! Somebody help me ! Help ! Seattle PD has the South edge . We 'll take center and work east . It 'd be nice if I knew what we were looking for . A message . A sign . Anything . Do you like this ? You 're seriously asking ? I knew you would . I picked it out just for you . Green 's your favorite color , isn 't it ? I can tell . I know you , now . Isabelle . Isabelle ... I 'm not really ready for another round right now , okay ? What are you so worried about ? If you don 't want to share your job , don 't . What are you talking about ? I can do things , Shawn . Lots of them . I figure out more every day . If you want to keep your job , you can . I can make it happen . You can do whatever . Who 's going to say different ? Thanks , I guess ... but , uh ... just hold off on the air strikes , okay ? We 're talking about your dad and Matthew here . It 's just an argument . They 're not the enemy . Besides ... they do have a point , don 't they ? I did screw up . Just so you know , it 's your call . Drink this . It 'll make you feel better . You 're frightened . It 's all right , I understand , but you don 't have to be . We 're not going to hurt you . Soon , you won 't even be worried anymore , I promise . These are just to relax you . They 'll help you get ready . Now , drink up , okay ? I 'll give you a brownie for dessert . Maia ... They 're doing it . They 're helping . We 'll take Dexter south , swing around for another pass . Wait , Tom . Stop . Stop ! What ? Those butterflies ... They 're in Maia 's journals . She 's here . Maia ... - What is going on ? - Don 't move ! Please . Please , this house is for sale . All the valuables are gone . Is this a dream ? No , honey . Remember the first time you were taken away from your parents ? This is where we brought you . - This isn 't real . - Yes , it is . We 've brought you back . You 've been here ever since you walked through the front door of my house . You 're in the future . We had to bring you here , Maia , you and your friends . We need your help . It 'll be over soon . Please , let me go . I want to go home . I 'm afraid you can 't . You 're too important . Sorry for it . The experiment that we tried has failed . There has been too much interferences . The 4400 haven 't changed the timeline . The catastrophe , it 's still coming . We 've found a way to fix it . You and your friends , you 're going to save us all . We found it all . Got the circle , the butterflies ... She 's here . I mean , she has to be here . Come on , I 'll take you home . Here . Sign here . Thank you , Shawn . I know this wasn 't an easy decision . Yeah , well ... We all want the same things , right ? You 're a good man , Shawn . It 's an honor to be working with you . Why are you giving this to me ? It 's a thank you . You did well . Everything went smoothly with Shawn . I disobeyed you , Matthew . I told Shawn he should keep his job . I disobeyed you , and you know what ? Nothing happened . There wasn 't an earthquake . I didn 't melt . I used to be scared of you , but I don 't think you have any power over me at all , do you ? I didn 't think so . I 'll do my own shopping , from now on , okay ? Okay , sweetheart , we 're ready to begin . Don 't cry . You and the other children we took , we tested your abilities , and you are so special . That 's why you were chosen . Now ... Here 's what 's going to happen . We 're going to put you all back ... Not the same year we took you from , but earlier . Much earlier . We calculated wrong the first time . We have to try again . There 's no other way . There 's no other hope for humanity . I don 't care . I don 't want to go anywhere . I want to stay with my mom . I know . It 's hard . I can make the pain go away . Before we put you back in your new time , we 'll make you forget your mother , Marco , and your friends . Please don 't . They 'll forget you , too . It 's better this way . There 'll be no sorrow , no pain , no loss . As far as the world is concerned , you 'll just be a girl who disappeared in 1946 and was never found . That 's a lie . My mom won 't ever forget me . She will . It 's happening already . Now ... Just lie still . All the hope we have rests with you . No ... Don 't do it , please . Mommy ! Traduction par Cedr _ c et Emiliezim Synchro par DaddyK !

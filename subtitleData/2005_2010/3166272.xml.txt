 Who am I , my God ? What am I ? I don 't ask you to believe in anything ... but my heart . But no one sees my heart . No one sees me . No one sees me . No one sees me . WE SEE THINGS NOTAS THEY ARE , BUTAS WE ARE . - Carlitos . - What ? It 's a graveyard out there . Cancel it . We go on in 6 minutes , even if it 's for an audience of one . There is only one person . Fine , in 4 minutes we perform for our audience . Let me see . Mother , I want you to put the Devil in my flesh tonight . In all great theatres , the props guy wants the star to break a leg on opening night . Son of a bitch . NOT EVERYTHING IS AS IT SEEMS TO BE . Common saying Pity those who do not see ! TO RENE CLAIR FOR THE ENDING THEY DID NOT LET HIM MAKE Time stands still in my chest if you are by my side . Old wounds heal , I am filled with love . With you , I sense that the world sings to me in silence . Its tender songs lulls me ... like a madrigal . What happened ? Did the fat girl traumatize you ? It 's not worth it . She 's a fat nobody . Why 'd she leave just as I was about to speak ? Javier , don 't sweat over it . If anything disappointed her , it was Angel 's bit with me . Or maybe she doesn 't like nuns . No . She looked into my eyes like ... I don 't know . What is this ? Maybe the fat girl can give you an erection . I can introduce you to her . She 's got a huge flat all to herself . Don 't get upset . Joel 's trapped inside . - Nothing will happen to him . - Yes it will . He 'll suffocate ! Look , he 's having some fun . Oh , it 's you . Come in . I thought you were different . All the men who come in here have the same face . I 'm Luisa . Coffee ? Tea ? Anything in particular ? Wine . But it has to be an ' 86 Rioja . I 'll go see . Take a look around meanwhile . Not everything is what it seems . This doesn 't look like wine . It looks like cola . It 's not a Rioja , but it is wine . I keep it in this because the bottle cracked . Why 'd you leave the theatre as I was about to speak ? Because the music was over . That song , " Madrigal " , is my kind of music . I thought it was because ... I don 't know ... And you went there just for that ? It is wine . Want to go for a walk with me ? On one condition . You don 't open your mouth . When I was a girl , my mother worked in that building . I imagined it was a hotel . Now this is my place . I 'm going . When it rains , I 'll be waiting for you . What 's this for ? Cigarettes ? Cousin , when I have more , I 'll give you more . When you have nothing , as usual , you give me nothing . And I 'm not your cousin . I 'm the shithead who married your cousin . One useless male here is more than enough . Pay me for rent and laundry before the weekend or ... The washer won 't work tomorrow , you 'll see . Away from me , mediocre emotions . Away from me , mean emotions . But will I be able ? When the rain comes , will my chest be cleansed ? Or will my human heart be mean ? Is something an inch from truth already a lie ? What am I , God ? What am I ? I don 't care to wear the grey gown of those who cannot see . Away from me , mediocre emotions . Away from me , mean emotions . Did you see the place ? I heard she collects porn magazines . I got it from a friend who tried unsuccessfully to sleep with her . What else did your friend say ? She 's all holier-than-thou , but actually she 's depraved . I 'm sure you can win her over . I 've got a plan . You make love to her , go live with her , poison her ... Then I 'll come live with you . I 'll have you every night in your " widower 's palace " , all night long , every night . I 'm on . When the rain comes , will my chest be cleansed ? Or will my human heart be mean ? Don 't open your mouth . Only I will speak . Look at me . I 'm invisible , and you men are transparent . They come to me wanting only one thing . My house . They think lies are the path , but they 're the end of the road . I 'm tired of men with no mystery . I want to be your friend , Javier . And I want you to be my friend , but on one condition ... that you don 't deceive me . If you want to be my friend , never deceive me , Javier . Never . Star . Not e-very-thing is what it seems . It is . I 'll wait for you tomorrow at four . In the Morgue . Dress as a nun . In the Empire of Eros ... It could be two things , you 're falling for Fatso or you 're becoming impotent . I 'm inspired , Eva . " Every minute without screwing is a lost minute . " You know who said that ? Nelson Mandela . I 'm inspired , Eva . I 'm going . " Every minute without love is a lost minute . " Mandela didn 't say it , his wife did . THE ARROW IN EROS ' QUIVER . THE BROKEN ARROW IN EROS ' QUIVER . Look , the soul is meant to leave the body through here . Honesty , purity and feelings should be inside . But there 's nothing . Look ... Why are you so quiet , Javier ? May I speak ? Something must exist , Luisita . And I 'm not interested in your flat . Luisita ! Come on up ! This is my flat . I 'm sharing it with my cousin and his wife until he finishes his house . Coffee ? Tea ? Anything in particular ? You don 't have ... a soft drink ? But it has to be cola . This is my special place . I don 't let my cousin or his wife in here . I come here to meditate and to write . You liar . You bring women , don 't you ? I meditate . Come on . You were the one who lied today . It wasn 't a lie . No ? What was it then ? An act of freedom . Nuns often visit me because of my work . It 's normal at the Morgue . If you hadn 't worn the habit , I 'd have had to get authorization and fill in a stack of forms . It wouldn 't have been the way I wanted . - But I 'm not a nun . - I didn 't lie to you . The only truth , Javier , is if there are no secrets between us . Luisita , don 't go . Look . As a kid what I liked most was bathing naked in the rain . Come on . Come on . Come on . I don 't want to keep secrets from you . Or you to keep them from me . I can 't . I feel sorrow taking my clothes off in front of you . The persistent rain misted her view . You 've got a visitor . Fourth row . The men who come to me want only one thing . They 're all transparent . And your soul ? Where is your soul ? No ... Don 't be afraid . That first day , I saw you that you had a porn magazine . No secrets . You 're not going to say it 's because you know one of the models ? Well , I do . The one in the centerfold ... is my mother . Here . Take a look . Open it up . She left when I was eight . She lives in Las Vegas . She was appalled when said I wanted to be a nun . She didn 't call or write for a long time . But now she often does . At least you can see she loves her job . One secret less , right ? My mom got a Model Worker Award . I hardly ever see her . Only when she 's in Bohemia Magazine . Now another secret . One of yours . Why 's that room always closed ? That 's my room . I don 't want anyone going into it . Ever . What 's your greatest dream , Javier ? To write a story . It 's always on my mind . What 's yours ? To shut myself in that room ... and play the harp . Naked ! I 'm sorry , Javier . I 'm ... I 'm a stupid , repressed fat girl . It doesn 't matter . I have to confess something to you . You 're the first woman in my life . I 'm invisible . Now I really feel invisible . Angel 's after you . He 's not . He felt my ass , that 's all . I love having my ass felt . In 1969 I 'd have asked to have it nationalized . Down with private property ! Has Fatso asked you to move in yet ? I got you what you wanted . - Here 's your laundry . - Thanks , cousin . I mean , Elvira . Don 't thank me . That 's my problem , a soft heart . You drank the cola I 'd saved for when I got back from Pinar del Rio with Machi . The theatre group is going on tour . I 'll make a few dollars and pay you what I owe . I 'll buy you all the soft drinks you want . Don 't get your hopes up . You 'll never earn anything or have anything . You know what gets me down ? Knowing I 'll always have the same furniture , the same husband with the same temper , the same pressure cooker every day ... It 's like running and running and getting nowhere . You 're the same too . You always will be . ... sex for no reason . This is for you . I can 't dance . Me neither . This sounds a bit weird . It 's very old . You wind it up from underneath . You 're so good , Javier . So beautiful ... I don 't know why ... Not everything is as it seems . Do you want to hear my story ? The one you 're writing ? No , that 's pure fiction . The story of my trauma . I 've never told anyone . Only you , now . When I was 16 , I fell in love with a teacher . And she with me . My love was a fantasy , I was 16 . But not hers . She was a math teacher . - What happened ? - What ? She taught me to make love as an exact science , without mystery . It was a math exercise : 1st movement , 2nd movement , theorem , 1st movement . Everything exact and repeated . It traumatized me . Afterwards , I tried to make love to other girls , but ... I couldn 't . What about you ? I hate exact sciences . You don 't have to do it . I want you , Javier . I could only make love with you . Me too . But first ... I want your mystery . Want to go for a walk with me ? But on one condition ... When will you let me into your room ? When I have my harp . Good afternoon . What do you want ? We 're here for the harp . What about it ? We wanted to know if it 's for sale . Nothing 's for sale here . Can we have a closer look ? Keep your fingers off it . Are you a musician ? Do I look like a musician ? I was a lute player , the best in Havana . But now look what I do for a living . Fix watches . Music 's finished for me . The harp 's a family heirloom . It belonged to my father . He really was a musician ? " El Negrito " from the Alhambra Theatre . What a coincidence . I 'm an actor myself . Don 't sweet-talk me . The harp 's not for sale , full stop . Wait ! How much would you give me for it ? May I come in ? No , Javier , no . The windows aren 't to be opened . Here it is . This will buy my harp . I hope this will be enough . If not , you can always pawn the chandelier . Not the lamp , it doesn 't work . The necklace will be enough . Do you like it ? Say something . You smell like a virgin . I want it always to rain . I want to speak the truth always . Or at least sometimes . Or at least once . Why should I always follow Truth ? Or should I only follow ... my own truths ? My love is above both Truth and Lies . All I ask is that you listen to my heart . My heart , my heart , my heart ... Please , listen up . The man from the Barcelona Festival came today . You know what that means ? - No ! - No ! Aside from this being a group of wanna-be 's who can 't act , is there any problem that can be solved right now ? - Yeah , why not ? - What is it ? The props flunky has got me rotten papaya for three days . Stay . The whole night ? Every night . What 's your story about ? Superstitious ? No , I 'm a coward . I don 't know if I am a writer . All I know is that I want to write this story . Alright then . It 's a science fiction story . It begins like his : " In 2020 the world had turned into smoke . It was an eroticizing smoke that conditioned people . No one could escape ... " No . Not now . When then ? When I have my harp . Why a harp ? Because you have to put it between your legs to play it . Talk to me about the theatre . The theatre ? No . I 'd love to act , but I can 't . I 'm nothing in the group . The props guy . This is the first time I 've had a small part . I studied acting , you know ? But at teachers college . Even there I wasn 't any good . I also know a bit about sound . I make a little fixing stereos , small change really . I think you 've got talent . I think you 're inventive . - I think you 're special . - Me ? You 're the special one . I 'm the same every day . And I always will be . You know what , Javier ? Never tell me you love me . This will be my only secret . I chose you . There was never any other . I didn 't go to the theatre for the music , I went because of you . I 'll take care of you every night . I 'll watch over you every night . If you have a nightmare , I 'll be with you . You 're the only beautiful thing in my life . I 'm your angel . An angel watching over you . Now what ? Look , we never asked you to pay for anything , right ? Only to contribute to the house . The best trait a person could have is gratitude . Especially if they 're family . You can 't just go . You can go right now , for all I care . But leave your crap here till you pay us some decent money . Am I interrupting ? Go and don 't worry , cousin . We won 't let anyone touch your stuff . Stupid cow . You did it , didn 't you ? Fatso fell for you . Luisita . Fine , Luisita , Fatso . Essential things are invisible to the eye , Eva . The Little Prince spoke like that because he was ten . I have friends that married fat Norwegians . They puff up and explode in a month . Fatso may win Nobel Prize in spirituality , but that 's no substitute for pointy tits . Mine , for example . Luisita has more fantasy in her than all the roles you 'll ever play . This fantasy has four bedrooms and three bathrooms ? Or is it five ? We had no future , Javier . Be careful with Angel . He 's always been an opportunist . And stupid . Angel feels me and sees me . Angel takes care of me . Angel watches over me . Angel loves me , Javier . I 'm going to marry him . I 'll give him a lot of children . Heaps of children . It 's that simple . I came to say goodbye . All those going to the fair ... How much ? Luisita ! Thanks . She told me the necklace was valuable . See ? Even my mother deceived me . Everybody does . Maybe she believed it . The necklace looks genuine . Maybe the harp 's a fake too . Sure , it 's a drum in disguise . No , I mean it may be out of tune , broken , have broken strings ... Who cares ? I wanted it so badly , to have it my room . It 's not for giving concerts . It 's my dream , don 't you get it ? It 's not for anyone else . Not even for you . My story 's not for you either . Did I say there 's a special meeting tomorrow at one ? No . Nobody told me . Yes , it 's been on the board for days . The people going to Barcelona will be named . I 'm dying to work with Catalonian prop guys . The ones here want to be Marlon Brando . Just kidding . Actually , for a prop guy ... you still can 't act . Aren 't you going to tell me to break a leg tonight ... Sor-bete ? - I 'm going for a piss . - God be with you , sister . I hope he does break a leg . No , not one , both of them . I hope he 's totally fucked up ! Motherfucker . Motherfucker . Motherfucker . Motherfucker ! What am I , God ? What am I ? A beast or an angel ? An angel or a beast ? A beast and an angel at the same time ? Don 't judge my acts , but their meaning . Only then can I be mistaken without feelings of guilt . Only then ... Lower the wire ! Get him down , shit ! Forgive me . Don 't judge my acts , but their meaning . What am I , God ? What am I ? A beast or an angel ? Angel and beast at the same time ? It was terrible , eh ? - Was he a friend of yours ? - He hated me . And I hated him . How can you say that , Javier ? Would you rather I lied to you ? Look , I 'm wound up . Don 't listen to me . The last thing I want is to argue with you . Alright ? Don 't open the window . I wasn 't going to . But what if I did ? Could you forgive me ? I 'm sorry . How could you do that to me ? My grandson was in love . He needed money to buy the finest rings in the world , and he came to me . I thought about you , but someone came with the cash and I couldn 't refuse . My grandson died last night . Are you alright ? No , no . My Angel wasn 't like other youngsters who forget old people . He was tender , shy , passionate . He 'd stay here for hours , just to keep me company . How could I say no the only time he asked me for something ? You said you were an actor ? - Maybe you knew him . - No , I didn 't . I have to go . Who 'd you sell the harp to ? A foreigner . A skinny girl , European ... I can 't recall her name . Young man ! She said her name was Stella ... Stella Maris . The show must go on . Angel would 've wanted it that way . We 're off to Barcelona in a week , as planned . The Festival rep is taking care of everything . I 've decided who 's replacing Angel . As of tomorrow , there 'll be daily rehearsals . We 'll do a last performance the night before we go . A triumph in Barcelona will be our best tribute . Stella Maris . I was worried . I won 't go to the Morgue anymore . Why not ? The ring your friend Angel was wearing disappeared . His grandfather asked for it . His girlfriend Eva says he was wearing it during the show . Everyone 's lying to save his or her skin . The receptionist thinks she saw a nun leave at dawn . The guard says he didn 't authorize the body to be taken to the room . They all lie , Javier . That 's why I left . I don 't care if they suspect me . And you ? Don 't you have anything to tell me ? I 'm going to Barcelona . They gave me Angel 's role . There 's a performance in two days . I want you to sit in the first row . I 'll bring you a harp from Barcelona . I swear . What am I , my God ? What am I ? An angel or a beast ? A beast or an angel ? An angel and beast at the same time ? What am I ? What am I ? What am I ? What am I ? Hello . This is where Javier lives , right ? You 're Elvira . How do you know ? I saw you in a picture at Javier 's place . Javier 's place ? You were in my house ? No , in Javier 's house . Sorry , I 'm in a rush . They 're waiting for me at the theatre . What do you want ? It 's not just the deception . He plays with people 's feelings . What did that girl look like ? Blonde . A real stunner . She 's an artist . I saw her on TV once , playing a hooker . It wasn 't the first time . Eva . Yes , the witch . So , what 's your name ? Luisita . Luisita , I don 't like doing this . I love him ... because he 's family , but ... I have to admit that Javier is sick . Sick in his mind . Now he 's writing this weird stuff , some kind of porn . He says it 's a short story . Literature ! No , it 's filth . He even wanted to read it to me . No way , no way . Machi and I want to help him , but it 's a real headache . So many lies . What can we do ? Tell me what I can do ? Why should I always tell the truth ? Or should I only speak my own truths ? My love is over and above Lies and Truth . I only ask you to listen to my heart . My heart my heart my heart . You made me shudder , Javier , you really moved me . Angel would 've applauded your performance . Luisita . Is there anything you 've lied to me about ? Luisita , listen . It 's not what it looks like . Get out there ! Go on ! Run after her , you shithead . Luisita ! Wait ! Luisita ! Luisita ! Listen ! Luisa ! Luisita ! Luisa ! Luisita ! Listen ! Open up , Luisita ! Open up ! Open the door ! Open up ! Open up ! Open up , Luisita ! It 's not what you think . Please , open the door . Listen to me . You didn 't want my house . I was your first woman . I was ... Okay ... I lied . So what ? Look at me . Look at me , Luisita . Can 't you see what I carry around inside me ? Go , Javier . Leave . I 'm leaving tomorrow . The airport bus will come past here at 4 p.m. If you want to forgive me ... open your window . The window you never wanted to open . If you open it ... I 'll be your angel ... an angel watching over you . I love you . Lies . Lies , lies . Machi ... Oh , I thought it was Machi . What is this ? I 'm only here tonight . The tour starts tomorrow . Want some yoghurt ? No , thanks . Javier . Zip me up . Do you like it ? They 've been promising us these uniforms for years . I was dying to put it on . Elvira ... I have to go . ... truth was in the fable but she knew how to retain her mystery and that sign guided me toward a purer light . ... it started to rain . I searched for Stella . We 're almost there . You know what ? I was ready to give it all up for Angel . If you really love her , get off the bus . Whether the window 's open or closed , get off . Luisa ! Luisita ! It stinks of gas . Are we there ? Not yet . Luisita ! Open up ! Luisita ! Someone call the firemen . How awful , my God . Open the window . She opened it , Javier ! She did ! Stop ! Stop for a second ! Javier , don 't do it ! Luisita ! I love you ! Here 's your harp , Luisita . And here 's my story . In 2020 , the world had turned into smoke , an eroticizing smoke that conditioned the senses . Escape was as futile as rebellion . This was the last city , the end of my journey in the empire of Eros . It was also the end of a search doomed to failure . Or so I thought , until I came before her . You don 't have to do it if you don 't want to . Are you mad ? I 'll have to report on you ! No . I can 't . Then why are you here ? At first I thought it was another body without a soul . But something in the depths of her gaze ... betrayed her . You 'd better go . Her eyes had the same tremor that for so long had dwelled in mine . You remind me of someone . You remind me of someone too . Yes , really . You remind me of my mother , the puritanical streak . Fortunately , she left . She disappeared . I only heard about her once . She became a nun . How old are you ? Go now . Sixteen . I 've done this job since I was fourteen . What 's your name ? Stella . Stella Maris . I 'd seen the same scenes , the same neon lights , in a thousand cities . The reign of the Empire of Eros was universal and invisible , its only law the right of each one to possess another . There , I was everyone 's and had no-one . But that night , I received another sign . I 'll take you wherever you want . - I can 't sleep with you . - I didn 't say that . Get in . Will you take me to my hotel ? I never give anyone a ride . But I could see you 're not from round here . How could you tell ? Your smell . You smell like a virgin . Join me for a glass of wine ? Alright . On one condition . You tell me everything . My name 's Eva . Angel . What are you looking for , Eva ? I 'll go if you like . Forgive me . I 've been here for three days and it 's been rough . Isn 't it the same as where you come from ? Yes . Everything 's the same everywhere now . It 's like running and running and going nowhere . I 'm revolted by what the world 's become too , Angel . That 's why I chose you . I 've been watching you for three days , since you came to this hotel and I saw you by chance . So running into me today ... ? Do you know why I chose you ? Look at me . Look at me , Angel . I want you . I 've wanted you from day one . I don 't want your body now . I want what 's inside you . I 'm leaving . Don 't go like that , it 's dangerous . Will I see you again ? When it rains again . In the old morgue . I don 't remember how long I had to wait . In the Empire of Eros , days were the same as nights . In this soulless Sabbath Eva came into my life to bring me the chance of a new life . Her apparition was like a music whose mystery only the rain could dispel . Tell me about the story , Angel . About " Madrigal " . It belongs to my daughter . I 'm almost sure of it . Why ? I lost her when she was four . Her mother ... wanted to escape with her and me from ... From this revolting world . But she didn 't believe in me . She thought I lied to her when actually ... she deserted me , left me alone . Two years ago ... someone left the story at my place , with no other information . I 've searched for them ever since . Now I have no hope . In nothing , not even in myself . Come with me . Trust me . Few people know about this . But something tells me it 's the beginning of Utopia . 98 . 98 . 98 . 98 . 98 . 46 . Angel . If your number 's called , you can leave this place . Some speak about virgin lands where everything is yet to be done . Others say it 's a far-off island . 21 . 21 . 21 . No smoke , no compulsory morality , where we can see each other ... Last number . ... over and above truth and lies . 66 . 66 . 66 . Has anyone seen it ? Has anybody come back to tell about it ? No-one . For the next lottery . It 's a double , for me and you . I couldn 't ... If it comes up , we 'll both be saved . You know why ? Because that day , we 'll make love for the first time ... freely . The hotel staff already eyed us with suspicion . We were a furtive couple and thus , suspected subversives . Where are they rushing off to ? I need a moment of your time . We 've received stern complaints about the gentleman 's ... and the lady 's behavior . But we said no , it wasn 't true . A slander . Or no ? For me , Eva was mystery in a world designed to wipe out the last bastion of mystery . I 've never been a puritan , Angel . I just can 't stand doing it out of obligation . They 've made us invisible . Stay ... Tonight ? Every night . The pledge not to touch each other until our lucky day is as fragile as the Utopia Eva had promised me . But within me was an awakening of desire and hope . 13 . Tomorrow a ship sails from the foggy pier . What 's it called . Barcelona . Last number . Last number . Last number . This is our last chance . Quiet . 44 . 44 . Is that the number ? Is it ? Now it doesn 't matter what you do , Angel . There 's a message in the story . Your daughter left you a message . It 's for you to work it out . Just listen to your heart . That night we made love in Eros ' World ... as if it were the beginning of a new world . I stayed the night next to Eva , feeling her infinite tenderness . My search was reaching its end and I couldn 't turn back . Looking at her I found the strength I was looking for ... and knew ... the purest light was guiding me . Oh , the puritan . Did you change your mind ? Take it . Though it may find it hard to believe , there is a better life than the one you 're leading . Why are you doing this ? Because ... you remind me of someone .

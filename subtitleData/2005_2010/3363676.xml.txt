 Torchwood Outside the Government , beyond the police . Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race . The 21st century is when everything changes ... and Torchwood is ready . Come on ! No , I can 't , I 'm late as it is . Rhys ! You 're itchin ' to go back to work , aren 't you ? Oh , I 'll take that as a yes , then . Having you to come home to , that 's the best bit . Unlabeled Class D artefacts . - Tosh , I need you to run a full check . - Sure . Owen , you can help . - Happy to . - Adam , I know how much you love audits . - It 's gotta be done . - If you could- - Go through the reports , find out when they came through the rift . - You okay with that ? - I have been for the last three years . You 're late . Yes , Paris was lovely , thank you ! Who the hell is this ? Just cos that 's what I said to you on your first day ... remember ? Like a nice strong coffee ... Sorry , couldn 't resist . Come here , you ! Good to see you . Hey , Tosh , you 're looking good . Adam , what are you doing with your personnel file ? Nothing , just finished updating details of rift activity . Any idea when this came through ? It 's got a low meson energy reading . No , I 'll keep looking . - A year ago today . - Our first kiss . You remembered . You okay , Owen ? Er , yes , yes , don 't worry about me . No , no , it 's just , er ... kissing in work ... I wasn 't expecting it . We 'll celebrate tonight . Save it ! Jack ? You okay ? Yeah , fine . - Did you miss me ? - Were you gone ? Just doing a quick check . We had rift activity two days ago , but nothing seems to have come through . Apart from me . What 's that ? It 's a screen-cleaner . I thought you might like it , um ... Do you like it ? Just what I need . A small rodent looking at me while I work . Think I 'll call it Owen . He 's like a little puppy , bringing her sticks . When 's he gonna realise he 's got no chance ? Love 's blind , apparently . He 's idolised her for years now . Oh , leave him alone . I think it 's sweet . He 's happy . Sorry , I didn 't mean to frighten you . - How did you get in ? - With a key . This isn 't funny . Stay back , all right ? Stay back ! Gwen , what 's going on ? How do you know my name ? Huh ? I know how to use this . - Who are you ? What do you want ? - You know who I am ... Fine , if you won 't tell me , fine . You stay there . Don 't you move . Jack ... Yeah , someone 's broken into my flat . He had a key . He knows my name . - Because I live here with you ! - Shut it ! Shut it ! Can you hurry , Jack ? He 's a nutter . You have picked the wrong girl to stalk , mate . - Gwen ? - Stay there ! Jack ? Gwen , it 's us ! In here , Jack ! - What 's going on ? - You tell me . Look , he 's put photos of us up . He must have done it while I was at work . He 's deluded ! He keeps saying he 's my boyfriend . He is . It 's Rhys . I 've never seen him before in my life ! - You 've been with him for years . - See ? ! Give me the gun , Gwen . No ! He grabbed me , Jack . Who knows what he was going to do ? How can you say that ? ! - What have you done to her ? - Nothing . Oh , come on , I know what kind of sick games you play . Pills to make you forget . Is that what this is , yeah ? Are you phasing me out so you can have her ? - Stay away from him . - We 're engaged ! I bought you the bloody ring you 're wearing ! Why don 't you come with me to the Hub . - Who the hell are you ? - He 's one of us . We can check you over . Jack will stay here and take care of things . Okay ? Don 't let him go . If he comes after me again , I 'll kill him . Trust me , I didn 't do this . But whatever 's happened ... we 'll put it right . Right , well , no signs of long-term damage , as far as I can see . Or alien intervention . But , I must be missing something . I 'm sorry , but it 's a mystery to me why you can 't remember Rhys . Is this really necessary ? She needs to remember . Where did you meet ? Er , college . Fancied her from the moment I saw her . Not just her looks , you know , I mean she is a looker , er ... Tell me about your first kiss . Erm , in the supermarket . I was gonna make her spag bol , and ... then I realised it , no bloody garlic . Can 't kiss a girl with garlic breath . Do you remember that ? Sort of . It 's like I 'm ... I said , I wanted to do something else . I 'm seeing what he 's saying , but ... I don 't remember how I felt . Believe me when I tell you that that is your fiance . Your memory 's just playing tricks on you , that 's all . ... She starts to laugh . She calls me " Rhys the Rant " and then she kissed me , right there in the queue . And I thought then , Jack , I thought , I 'm going to marry this bloody mad woman , even if it kills me . Worked out what that thing is yet ? No joy yet . But you should have a look at the detail , Tosh . It 's gorgeous . Oh , let me get that . Have you managed to open it yet ? Er , no , sorry . I 'm not doing very well , am I ? It 's gonna be a long night . Yes , which is why I brought ... some sandwiches ! One for you ... and one for me . Smoked salmon , that , uh , that is your favourite , isn 't it ? How d 'you know that ? I 'm gonna need a beer . What , while we 're working ? ! Oh , yeah , of course . Yeah , right , relax , kick back , it 's a good idea . Er , not for me though , thanks ! Don 't leave me , Jack . You 'll be okay . What was that all about ? Temporary amnesia . Owen 's checking possible causes . Weevil sighting by the sewer in Rockall Street . Jack ? Jack ? ! - Can you see him ? - Who ? I 'll drop you off and check out the sighting . I could come with you . It 's been a while since we went hunting together . I 'll be fine on my own . Go on . Live a little . Well , as it 's you . Thank you . Call it a celebration . Oh , yes ? Adam and I have been together for one year today . Right , right . A whole year . My stomach still flips when he touches me . I 've never known anything like it . The two of us , we just fit . D 'you know what I mean ? Erm , not sure I do , no . Don 't worry . You 'll meet the right girl one day . Yeah . Tosh ... D 'you really think I look like a rodent ? Come on , we 're going to crack this box even if it kills us . Come out , come out , wherever you are . Giving me the runaround , huh ? You picked the wrong day , my friend . Get out . Get out , son . Dad ? Run ! Jack ? Was it down there ? The Weevil ? No . How did you get here ? I came with you , Jack , remember ? Yeah , of course . Are you okay ? Jack , what did you see ? My past . - If what you say is true ... - It is . We love each other . But how could I forget that ? Nothing in . I was gonna take you out for a meal . Didn 't want the weekend to finish , I suppose . Jack , please . Talk to me . What about the past ? Is it your childhood ? I 've always been here for you , Jack . From the very beginning . I 'm the one you can confide in , remember ? It was meant to be buried . I buried the memory over 150 years ago . Why now ? Well , maybe it 's time . Maybe up until now , your subconscious has been protecting you . But you can 't block out the past forever . I can 't afford to remember . - Jack , talk to me , please . - Why ? I can help . Trust me . I 'm not sure I should do this . Just tell me what you see . I can help you . That 's why I 'm here . Where are you , Jack ? Boeshane Peninsula . My home in the 51st century . We lived under the threat of invasion . They came without warning . We thought they 'd pass over us , like they always did . But they didn 't . - Not that day . - Who ? The most horrible creatures you could 've possibly imagine . Their howls travelled before them . Run ! Take Gray . Keep him safe ! - Take Gray . - Gray ? My little brother . No , no , Dad . Come with us . No , I 've got to go get your mother . Run ! One minute , I was holding his hand . I don 't know when he let go . Gray ? Gray ? Gray ! Gray , where are you ? Gray ! One minute , his hand was in mine , I don 't know when he let go . I don 't think I noticed , I thought he was there , just behind me . Gray ! I retraced my steps , hoping that I 'd see him again . Did you find him ? Gray ! I ran all the way home . Where are you ? Gray ! Jack , what did you find ? Dad ? No ! Can someone help ? Please ! I searched for Gray for years . I never found the body . It wasn 't your fault . I let go of his hand ! It was the worst day of my life . It 's the last thing I want to remember . So , according to the molecular breakdown , this potentially alien complex artefact is , in fact , made out of wood . Well , perhaps it fell in the crate by mistake . Picked up meson energy from the other stuff . Yeah , right ! Oh , yes , sorry , it 's a stupid idea . I think Jack brought it in . No , I 'm sure Adam found it on an excavation a few months back . I 'll have a look in the diary . I like to log the interesting stuff . You write about artefacts in your diary ? Among other things . So , we are done for the night . I guess . Everything all right ? - Yeah , just , Adam hasn 't rung yet . - Ah . Sure he will . I know I would , if it was our anniversary . I wouldn 't disappear . Infact , I would ... cherish you . Ah , Owen ! Yeah , no , no , really , really , I would . Infact , I wouldn 't let you out of my sight , Tosh ... because I love you . What ? Yeah , there we are . I 've said it . I love you . Yes , I always have , actually , ever since we started working together , and in fact , I actually ache for you . When you 're in the room , I want to reach out and touch you and ... - Owen ! - No , no , no , I can 't keep this secret any more ! My mum said to me , " Seize the day " , and so I am seizing it , and I 've got so much love to give you , Tosh , and you won 't know that unless I tell you . So here I am , telling you that I love you . You know I know there 's Adam , okay , but you know , I think ... In fact , I know that we would be amazing together , erm ... if you would only just give it a chance . Oh , God . Say something . That is completely inappropriate . - Pardon ? - What are you thinking of ? - I 'm sorry , I just wanted you to know . - How dare you ! I 'm with Adam . And even if I wasn 't ... you 're not my type . Never will be . Maybe I should be on my own tonight . No way . What if you forget who you are ? I know who I am . It 's not just you who 's lost something . But you remember . All you know about me . You 're my girl , my best friend . Suddenly , all that 's gone . A stormer of a night ! - What about her , mate ? - Where 's he going now ? He just walked off ! He knows I 'm waiting . Oh , fine . I 'll help myself , then ! Here you are . Keep the change ! Buy some spot cream ! I 'm not coming here again . It 's overpriced . There 's a £ 1.50 charge on the cash machine . It 's a bloody disgrace . Honestly . Kids these days . Don 't know the meaning of hard work . - What ? - Rhys the Rant ! Always when you 're in a queue , or driving , or when you 're on the phone to one of those automated phone thingies ... Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . Come on , sweetheart . What 's wrong ? My ... diary . You 're not in it . Everyone else is . Why would I leave you out when you 've been here so long ? Like I 'm remembering a man who doesn 't exist . What are you ? Cross me , and I will fill you full of fake memories until your head is on fire , because that 's how I exist . Gwen . What did you do to her ? Memory is a very delicate thing . Feeding myself in wiped other memories out . It 's a side-effect of what I have to do in order to survive . Jack has to know . Remember this . I know you didn 't mean to kill her . You just couldn 't stop yourself . Remember this . I didn 't do that . Oh , yes , you did , and she wasn 't the first . Please don 't hurt me ! Good old Ianto , loyal Ianto . Roaming the streets at night for bait . My ... diary ! All human record is a lie . You twist it into what you want to believe . But we know the rot in your heart . You crave flesh . No . Please . Remember it . Remember it . Remember it ! Remember it ! Remember it ! I helped you dump the bodies . It 's me you call . You know , I forgot what a rush it is , feeding in the bad stuff . Franklin ? Franklin , wake up . Please ! Mom ? Where 's Gray ? Where 's Gray ? Where is he , son ? Where is he ? We were running so fast . One moment , his hand was in mine ... No , not my little boy ! Not my little boy ! Why now ? Why now ? Anything ? It 's still a bit of a blur , but I 'm getting there . That 's all we 've got , really . Memories . That 's what brought us to here . To this point . We found it before , we 'll find it again . You know , I , um , I always worried that you 'd ... that you 'd just settled for me , you know ? Cos if you met me now , Gwen , with all that goes on in your life , could be that you wouldn 't look twice at me . Don 't say that . - Do you remember that ? - No . It felt like the first time . But it was nice . I like that . I know . Remind me some more . What 's wrong ? How far would you go for me ? I need to know . Would you die for me ? Yes . Jack ... Ianto . What 's wrong ? You have to put me in the vaults . Lock me up . I killed three girls . Strangled them . Stop kidding around . I 'm serious . I murdered them , in cold blood . I took their bodies , and ... You have to lock me away ... before I turn on you . None of you are safe ! Hey , hey , come here , come here . What 's happened to you ? I 'm a monster . Best lie detector on the planet . If something 's untrue , the light turns red . Go . My ... hands on her throat . And it felt so good . Squeezing the life out of her . It reads as truth . I don 't believe it . Okay , tell me about the second girl . She tried to get away ... but I was too quick . Pleading ... and I ... I didn 't care . Something in me wants to kill . No . This is not you . Something 's changed you . You 're not a murderer . I 'm certain of it . All human record is a lie . You crave flesh . Remember this . A year ago today ... you remembered . Do you remember that ? Who the hell is this ? Just cos that 's what I said to you on your first day , remember . Remember ? Remember ? Well , I came with you , Jack , remember . Remember , remember . I can help you that 's why I 'm here . Remember this . Come here , come here , just look , look . Remember it . Remember it , remember it , remember it . Remember it . Where 's Adam 's blood sample ? Everything 's in order here . When was it last updated ? Um ... 24 hours ago . Owen ... About last night , um , it was selfish of me . Owen , I think the world of you ... I know . I 'm really sorry . I don 't want to jeopardise our friendship . See , the most important thing is that you 're happy . Thank you . Tosh ... you are ... you are happy with Adam , aren 't you ? Completely . Okay . Hey , how are you today ? Um , things are coming back slowly . Rhys thought I shouldn 't come into work but ... Hey , we 'll look after you . You just have to give yourself time . Come on . Group hug . Hey Ianto , come here . You all right , mate ? Listen , I could murder a coffee . Talk to me , Adam . If that 's even your name . - What ? - What are you doing , Jack ? He 's not who you think he is . He 's been feeding himself into our memories , by touch . Is this some kind of sick joke ? He didn 't exist until two days ago . Can somebody tell me what 's going on , please ? Jack , we 've known him for years . - He is part of the team . - No . He just made you think that . Come on , Jack . Ah , you don 't get to me like that . Jack , you know me . You recruited me three years ago . All I know is , when I think of my team I see you there , but I don 't feel anything for you . No pride , no warmth . You , the one who I can confide in , the one who unburied the dead . Jack , maybe you 've forgotten him . Like I did with Rhys ? No , I should have spotted it then . That wasn 't stress . That was him . By making us think we know him , he disturbs our real memories . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I 'm taking him to the vaults . - Jack , this is ridiculous . - Move ! No ! - Tosh , that 's not gonna help . - It 's fine . I 'm just going to lock him up . Let him go . I 'm not going to harm him . Why should I believe you ? Tosh , Tosh , we can talk about this . Drop the gun , Jack . Get off me ! This is what you 've done to us . Move ! Adam ! Don 't kill me . I had to become part of your memories in order to survive . I didn 't mean any harm . - You 've changed us . - For the better . You didn 't remember who you were . I helped you . Look at Owen , all his cynicism gone . He 's a different man now . Selfless , happier . And Toshiko , too . She 's never been this confident . How did you come here ? Why us ? All of you have such unique memories , specially you , Jack . All those extraordinary memories you hold , some hidden , some absent . Your singular mind . That 's what drew me here . Good job . It 's what we do best ... wipe out aliens . You can 't shoot me ! You made me live ! And you always remember what you killed ... don 't you , Jack ? Our memories define us . Adam changed those memories ... changed who we are . Now I have to help you all go back , find a memory that defines you . Rediscover who you are . If I 'm wrong , he 'll still be here when we 've done this . Let me take you back to before we all met . Feel around for anything that makes you what you are ... the hidden and the forgotten . Tell me where you are . The college canteen ... Rhys is sitting opposite me , telling stupid jokes . Where do you find a tortoise with no legs ? Where you left it . It 's my birthday . I 'm ten . Mum spends the whole day screaming , " I love you because you 're my son but that doesn 't mean I have to like you . " Maths club , something so reliable about maths ... always the right answer . Meeting Lisa , falling in love , never felt so alive . I turn 16 . She packs me bags . That is the nicest thing you 've done for me in years , Mother . Kissing him in the supermarket . The look on his face . My first flat . I don 't have a flat-warming . There 's no-one I want to invite . Losing Lisa . Like the world had ended . The way he looks at me sometimes . As if he 's scared of what he feels for me , I love him . But not in the way I love you . Take this . Knowing there has to be more to life than this . Knowing I 'm special , waiting for someone to see it . I saw it . You save one life , 100 lives but it 's never enough . Who 'll save me ? I will . Coming here gave me meaning again . You . You each have a short-term amnesia pill . It 'll make you forget Adam . We have to wipe out the last 48 hours from our memories , go back to who we were . I 'm going to lose so much . None of it was real . He loved me ... and I loved him . It 's no different from real memory . He forced it on you . You have to let it go . Goodbye , Adam . Just me left . Jack , I know what it 's like not to exist . Please don 't send me back there . I have to . What are you going to do ? This will wipe out the past two days . Well , you 'll still keep the bad memories . Because they were always yours . But what about the good times , Jack ? What about the last good memory of you and your dad ? - It 's lost . - I can help you find it . I can take you back there . Before I die . Why would you do that ? I was in the void for so long , the colours of this world almost blinded me , Jack . It was so beautiful after the darkness and the stench of fear . You gave me that . Let me do this for you . Come on . You want this . It 's early evening ... just me and dad . Oh , no , you don 't ! You 're out ! You know , one day you 're not going to want to play with your old dad any more . Never . Are you there ? Yeah . Me , dad and ... - Dad ! Mom said I could play too ... - Gray . Hey , Gray ! - All right , son . One more . - Okay . Whoa , I 'll get it . I 'm running for the ball ! Some other boy is there . I don 't know who . - Can I play ? - Who are you ? - My name 's Adam . - Let me play . Before it gets dark . There 's lots of room . Hey , what are you doing ? Are you all right ? I just want to play . He can play . No ! He doesn 't belong here . I don 't want him playing with us . I 'm Adam . Don 't touch my dad . Hey , easy ! Are you all right , Adam ? Yes , he just doesn 't want to share . Right , well , if you 're going to behave that way , we 're going home . - What ? ! - Come on , Gray . No , we don 't leave yet . We play some more , it gets dark , we light a fire ... mum joins us . Come on , son . I 'll race you . Race you . Dad ! You did this . You spoilt it . I made it happen . Dad ! Dad , I love you . Dad , wait ... dad ! I want the real memory back . Then let me live . That box you found contains my last good memory of you , your dad and Gray . You see , I 'm a part of it now , and I 'll always live as long as you remember it . That 's why you took me back . Wasn 't it lovely ? Playing in the sand , no-one knowing what was ahead ... your dad laughing . Gray , safe and happy . I don 't want to die ! You take that pill and you will lose everything I 've given you . Wipe me out now and you will lose all your memories of your father . He will cease to have existed for you . Goodbye , Adam . Dad ! Gray ! Come back ! It wasn 't like this ! Dad ! Gray ! Jack , how have we lost two days ? What d 'you mean ? The last 48 hours . None of us can remember a thing . The system 's blank , the CCTV 's been wiped . What 's been going on ? What 've we been doing ? I don 't know . Great ! That 's two days of my life that I 'll never get back ! Looks like Toshiko got herself a secret admirer , though . Oh , yeah ? " To Tosh , love and apologies , Owen . " They 're from you . In your dreams , Tosh . I think someone 's winding you up , darling . No , I don 't do flowers ... and I definitely don 't do apologies . Did you call ? Found your diary . Yep , been looking for that . And for the record ... measuring tapes never lie . Hey ! Yep ? Who 's Adam ? Don 't know .

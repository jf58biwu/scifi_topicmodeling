 [ clap of thunder ] I got one more box . That 's all we 've got time for . ( woman ) Base camp , come in . Moving in three meters . You should be coming to a fork . Do you see it , Valerie ? Just a few meters ahead . ( guy ) It 's just a cave . This isn 't it ! Are you sure these are the right coordinates ? We 're not seeing it . It 's getting worse . The Captain said we missed our window . Is that Panos ? What 's he saying ? He said we missed our window . Okay . Well , then it doesn 't matter . We 're going to head in a bit further . How bad is it gonna get ? Bad . [ clap of thunder ] What 's wrong ? We should 've left while we could . What , you 're not afraid of a little rain , are you ? [ rumbling ] You okay ? Yeah . What was that ? I 'm not sure . Could be some land failure due to the heavy rain . You 're not afraid of a little land failure , are you ? This is crazy . You better get back to the beach . We 're gonna need the rest of those crates . All right . Did you feel that ? Yeah , yeah . We 're all okay here . Panos is getting the rest of the crates . I think we should call it a day , Valerie . Valerie ! Hold on . I got something . Pottery shards . [ radio interference ] Fourth century . This is a hydra . We could be looking at one of the lost oracle sites of Zeus , maybe Amphiarus . [ laughs ] Valerie , this could be our island . Let 's keep going . [ grunts ] Come on ! [ roar ] [ shouts ] Panos ? [ distant shouting ] Panos ! This passage should lead us to the chamber of Zeus . According to the lore , it 's the sacred resting place of the sword of Hercules . [ radio interference ] Shin ? Shin ! Base camp , come in . Panos ! Panos ! [ groans ] [ shouts ] [ distant scream ] That 's it . I 'm gonna go see what the hell is going on . Base camp , come in . What 's going on over there ? [ screaming and roaring ] [ roaring ] [ radio interference ] No , no . [ rumbling ] Camden , our cargo is awakening . Well , drug them again . There 's no point in having them up and around if we don 't have an island . Look , I told you we had an island . Now it 's gone . And what did it do ? Did it just get up and walk away ? No , but it may have sunk . [ laughs ] Excuse me , sir . There 's been heavy volcanic activity in the region . It is possible the island we had is gone . He 's right . Enough of this , okay ? I have four of the richest men in the world cooling their heels on my deck . What do you suggest I tell them ? Tell them that your incredibly resourceful Captain is currently looking for an alternative site . My incredibly resourceful Captain . And what do I tell them when they ask me how long it 's gonna take to find an alternative site ? By tomorrow . Tomorrow . Tomorrow ? Twelve hours . You have my word . I don 't want your word , Mr. Sweet . I want an island . Sunk ? Volcanic activity ? What the hell is going on , Mr. Winters ? It is true . The island we charted is not there . Is something else bothering you , Mr. Winters ? What 's going on on this boat is wrong . I did not sign up for this ! You were paid , and paid well , Mr. Winters . Just find us an island . That 's all you have to do . Don 't concern yourself with the rest of it . That 'll be all , Mr. Winters . [ metal door closes ] [ clanking of chains ] Hello ? Don 't move . Who 's there ? The drugs are going to start wearing off . It 's gonna hurt real bad . I feel sick . Yeah , like sea sick . Are we on a boat ? What 's going on ? No , look , no . We 've been kidnapped . I mean , look . So what is this ? Some kind of prison ? A prison on a boat ? No , I 've been to prison . This is something different . [ shouts ] Hello ? No one 's going to answer you . Is there something that you know ? I know I 'm not worth anything by looking at the rest of you . I 'd say that holds true for all of us . What does that have to do with anything ? It means there 's no ransom , idiot . That 's right . You said you 've been to prison . Anyone else ? I have . Well ? There 's our link . Now we just have to figure out if we have a mutual enemy . You . Any enemies ? Do ex-husbands count ? I know I 've got my share . What about you ? One or two . Hello , Mr. Nolan . I 'm in . ( Broughton ) Call . I 'm going up for 200 . Hello ! Look at this , fellas . Raising 200 . ( Trotta ) That 's not the only thing raising around here . I heard that . I didn 't know they provided entertainment on this cruise . I 'm out . Two hundred more . ( Elkins ) Oh , mercy . By the way , I 'm all in . But sit here and watch this . That kid 's something . Five thousand , says he strikes out in thirty seconds . If you needed help with that , all you had to do was ask . Mm , what a gentleman . See , I don 't see why you 're with that older man . I 'm worth at least twice as much . And I don 't need that little blue pill for that little extra kick . [ laughs ] Mr. Elkins . When I said that this expedition was all-inclusive , I was not referring to my wife . Relax , Vincent . If you could get us off this boat , we wouldn 't be looking for other things to occupy our time . You have to have patience , Mr. Elkins . I can assure you that my incredibly resourceful Captain and his first mate are working on it . By tomorrow we 'll have an island . Thank God . Another night on this junk and I might just throw myself to the sharks . Well , Mr. Williams , if you wanted room service and you wanted mints on your pillow , you should 've stayed home . I was under the impression that you contracted with me because I provide an alternative . Yeah . An alternative that our money finances . Let 's not forget that little piece of info . Speaking of info , when do I get to know more about the catch ? At dinner tonight . And that will be served in about 30 minutes . Sweetheart ? Come with me . It seems that you and I have a difference of opinion on what keeping the guests happy means . Don 't be so threatened , Vincent . Well , that 's fine . You play your little games , but I want you to play them with a little more clothes on and a little less touchy feely . I 'm just gonna make sure that one of the things they remember about this little excursion is my ass . And not the 72 hours of delays and missing islands , okay ? Dixie ? This discussion is not over . Eat up . You need your strength . What do you want from us ? We want you to eat . N ice one . You almost had him . Shut up . You actually gonna touch that ? You heard him . We 'll need our strength . How do you know they didn 't do nothing to it ? What more do you suppose they can do to you ? If they wanted to kill you , you 'd already be dead . Do you think they wanna kill us ? I didn 't say that . I 'm Gwen . Tim Nolan . I 'm Ronnie . Do you have a name ? No . Nolan , right ? You seem to know a lot about everything . Where are they taking us ? I have no idea . We 're gonna be doing labor at some illegal labor camp . That 's why we need our strength . What are you talking about ? Consider us lucky if that 's all it is . ( Camden ) Where are we ? Does it matter ? It 's completely uninhabited , largely uncharted and absolutely in the middle of nowhere . It 's not gonna get much better than this . How did you find it ? It popped up on a couple of old charts . No official name on record , so if you 'd like to do the honors . What do you think , Camden ? Will she do ? Twenty , thirty miles of challenging rugged terrain . She 'll do just fine . Mr. Winters , drop anchor . Have Horst and Otto go ashore . There 's nothing here . What 'd you expect ? It 's an island . Sand , trees , bugs . It 's the same thing everywhere we go . It 's a shame , you know ? No , I don 't . What are you talking about ? The brunette . She 's kinda cute . It 'd be a waste . Rule number one . No fraternizing with the meat . Who said anything about fraternizing ? If Camden catches you . No one 's gonna catch me . [ distant shriek ] Did you hear that ? Let 's just keep moving . Sweet said to get a complete survey . What 's the survey ? It 's beach and jungle . Who 's gonna know the difference ? [ roar ] What was that ? Let 's not find out . Come on , let 's keep moving . [ screaming ] [ shouts ] [ screaming ] Would you look at this spread ? Oh , my . I haven 't seen such gourmet since the last time I was at Bart 's Greasy Spoon in Jersey City . Bart 's Greasy Spoon ? You mean Silver Spoon , don 't you , Elkins ? No , Pops . I made my own bones . Not all of us were lucky enough to have a house sitting on an oil field . Too bad . May I pour you champagne , sir ? Fill her up . I paid for it . I might as well drink it . Sir ? Nothing like first class on this outing , huh ? Nothing like first class on this outing . So , Mr. Waiter , how do you like your job ? It 's hard to say . It 's the first job I 've ever had . Gentlemen . Good news . We have our island . It 's confirmed . It 's time to meet your game . Gentlemen , in this room we have gathered wealth beyond even our wildest dreams . It 's not the only thing we have in common . It 's not just the fact that we 're all avid hunters . Each and every one of us has dealt with a personal tragedy . The loss of a loved one . And loss not by chance . But loss in pain due to a failed system . It 's negligence . It 's injustice at the highest degree . A wife killed by a drunk driver . A daughter brutally raped and murdered . A son whose bright future was removed in a blink of an eye by a carjacking . Each and every one of us has sat and watched heartbroken as the system that was designed to protect us has failed us . And over the years I have found that there 's only one way to ease the pain . And this is not just revenge . This is justice of the highest degree . I would like you to meet Ronnie Kaplan . Now , Ronnie was well on his way to becoming the next internet billionaire and he decided to have some fun one night . Now , his blood alcohol level at the scene of the accident was three times the legal limit . The woman who was driving the other car was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident . Now , this next one , his lives name is Bob Crick . Bob raped three girls on a college campus in Auburn , Alabama . Now , his fourth victim was an 18-year old freshman , and they never found her body . But a police canine did find her right index finger right off campus . Next we have a real beauty . Gwen Russo . Now , Gwen , she took her husband 's double barrel shotgun . And she not only shot him once with it , but she reloaded the shotgun three times . [ clears throat ] Tim Nolan . Breaking and entering . Burglary . Assault and battery . Uh , he was released on a weekend furlough six months ago . He 's 178 days late . Consider him our , our man of mystery . ( Winters ) Aegeas , calling Otto . Otto , come in . [ radio interference ] Horst , this is Aegeas . Do you copy ? Do you copy ? Clarity , Mr. Sweet . Of utmost importance in these operations is clarity . I thought I made myself very clear when I said no surprises . The fourth had a heart attack during kidnapping . Why wouldn 't you tell me that ? I take care of things . That 's why you hired me . Who is this Nolan ? He 's everything you said he was and more . This is my operation . And I pay you very well for your services . And up until now you have done your part very well . But don 't you dare take me for a fool . Don 't drop something like this on me again . Are we clear ? This Nolan better be who you say he is . Or what ? Excuse me ? A threat like that usually carries an " or what ? " like , you go too far , it 'll be you on the island . Are you threatening me , Mr. Sweet ? No . Just looking for a little clarity . That 's right . Clarity . It 's time . Let 's go . Come on , let 's go . Come on . Get out of here . Let 's go . Let 's go , sweetheart . [ groans ] Get up ! Let 's move ! [ groans ] Get up ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Line up . Straight across . You , here . You , right here . Ladies and gentlemen . Whatever the hell 's going on here , ain 't right . I 'm sure for the past few hours you 've been wondering , what am I doing here ? You 've been thinking to yourselves , what could four strangers , complete strangers , have in common ? I 'll tell you what you got in common . Each one of you committed a crime . You were tried . You were convicted . You 're standing here because our justice system failed . Now , I consider it my personal responsibility to make sure that miscreants , deviants , scum like you are given proper justice . On this boat there are four men whose lives were destroyed by individuals very much like yourselves . There are four men on this boat that would very much like to see you pay for what you 've done so that other innocent people wouldn 't have to suffer their same fate . And believe you me , these men have paid an obscene amount of money for this privilege . What kind of game are you playing here ? Ding , ding , ding , give the gal a cigar . It 's a game . And you know what the game is ? The game is hunt the felon . And by this time , I 'm sure you 're getting the picture of what your part in the game is . You 're the hunted . I can see that Ms. Russo is finally getting the full picture here . Don 't you worry , Ms. Russo . You 're gonna make a beautiful trophy . [ sighs ] All right . Let 's talk about rules . There are no rules really . It 's only really a guideline , and that guideline is , stay alive as long as possible . We 're gonna give you a day 's head start . And that 's a lot more than you deserve . You 're crazy . I mean , you just can 't do this . You just can 't hunt us like we 're some damn animals . No , you 're right , Mr. Kaplan . We 're not gonna just hunt you . These men , they 're gonna kill you . Take them ashore . Go ! Keep going . Move ! Let 's go ! Go ! Going through a lot of trouble having me killed . If I wanted you dead , you 'd be dead . I want you to suffer . [ beep ] Off the boat ! Move ! Now ! Move it . Move it ! That 's far enough . You have 24 hours . That watch will give you a countdown . The island is roughly 30 square miles . Completely uninhabited . Good . No one can hear me ... Hey ! Don 't be a fool , Mr. Crick . The game is more fun with four . Keep walking . Come on . Good luck . Move ! Hey . Where the hell are you going ? They 'll be hitting the island from the same point we did , and they 'll probably split up from there and make their way inland from four separate vectors . The higher ground will act as a natural barrier . The rest is up to us . Up to us ? What are we , some team now ? Who made you boss , huh ? I 'm getting off this island if I have to swim it . Suit yourself . You should know that the reefs we passed in the way here were lined with seals . And where there are seals , there are sharks . Between that and the riptide , you won 't make it 20 feet . How the hell you know all this ? Look , in 20 hours those hunters are coming for us and they 're going to kill us . Now , I 'm not going down without a fight and I can use all the help I can get . Fight ? With what ? These guys probably have guns big enough to stop a charging rhino . Weapons everywhere . You just have to know where to find them . Have a nice swim . [ rumbling ] What was that ? A tremor ! You mean like an earthquake ? [ rumbling ] Come on . Let 's get moving . Come on , man . Man , I heard last year it only took six hours to bring down the last one . Yeah ? My money 's on the quiet one . The kid ? No , the older one . No way , man . Too confident . Too cocky . Care to put a wager on it ? Ah ! Where 's the boat ? [ monster shrieks ] [ shouts ] [ distant shout ] Looks good . Ronnie , try it like this . It 'll hold better . Okay . So what did you find ? All right , guys , this is the lowest point on the island . If we can lure them here , it 'll make for an ideal trap . Assuming they all choose to stay together . They won 't . Okay , so how do you plan on luring them here ? Take a look at this . All right . There 's a clearing here . Assuming they come from the same shore we did , we 'd light the fire here , they 'll see the smoke and head right for it . As long as we stay together , we 'll outnumber them . What makes you so sure they 're gonna split up ? They 're hunters . Wealthy ones at that . Big egos . They definitely gonna wanna hunt alone . All right . So , how many of these do you think you 're gonna need ? As many as you can make . Looks good , Ronnie . It 's okay ? Yeah . We 're gonna be all right , huh ? You bet . Yeah . So , you know who he is , don 't you ? The Captain ? Yeah . You 're not random like the rest of us ? No , we go back a ways . We gotta finish this trap . Let 's move . Knut and Gunner have not returned , yet . I think that we should tell Mr. Camden . No . This operation has suffered enough setbacks . We push forward . Mr. Sweet , that 's four crew members gone missing on this island already . We will say nothing . Knut and Gunner probably had trouble with the boat . I will send out a search party in a few hours . Weird things are happening on this island , Mr. Sweet . Something ain 't right . I said we will send out a search party in a few more hours . Do you guys really think this is gonna work ? Why would you say that ? I mean , all the hard work we 've done . I don 't know . I 'm just , you know , I 'm tired and I 'm scared . It 's gonna work . It 's gotta work . I think whoever comes to this island , is gonna be in for a real surprise . ( Ronnie ) See ? That 's what I like to hear . ( Cricket ) We ain 't there , yet . It 's gonna be daybreak soon . They 'll be here before we know it . ( Ronnie ) At least we 're not giving up without a fight . [ beep beep ] Why don 't you just let your machine do the hunting for you ? Gentlemen . It 's time . Who 's the lucky man who gets the lifeline ? I 'll take it . What did you find ? This isn 't even two months ago . I thought they said this island was uninhabited . Maybe it 's not . We should go tell the others about this . M-hm . We should , sunshine . What 'd you do ? The hunters are gonna be on their way . We need to get back to camp . I heard our host 's little speech back there on the deck . Accused , tried and convicted . I believe were the words he used . You don 't strike me as a bank robber . I don 't see you baking up white crunch in the back of some double-wide some place , so you know what ? I 'm guessing . I 'm guessing you killed a man . Daddy , maybe ? Or maybe you found out your boyfriend was getting it on with some cuda-cat down at the office . [ laughs ] Aren 't you the least a bit curious what I did ? No . It doesn 't matter . Okay ? So can we please just go back to camp ? Let 's just say I 've got a reputation where I 'm from . Why don 't you allow me to demonstrate ? Let go of me . You 're going nowhere , sweetheart . Let go of me . [ screams ] There 's nobody here but you and me . Your boyfriend should have taught you a thing or two about respect . [ screams ] What are you doing , Crick ? Kind of hard to talk when your windpipe is being crushed . Piss off . I 'm gonna pretend that your wires got crossed for a second here . And I 'll make this painfully clear . You 're either with us or them . Just kill him . Are you game or are we ending this right here right now ? We cool ? I 'm cool . I 'm cool . Get back to camp . You okay ? Yeah . We found some crates up there . This island might not be deserted . [ engine at a distance ] That 's them . Let 's go . Now , that is a beautiful piece of hardware . Laser sight . Semiautomatic barrel . Infrared scope . Boo ! [ chuckles ] What do you think ? I 'll take the east . Not so fast . Is there a problem , Williams ? Only if you 're gonna try to tell me what I 'm gonna do . We all paid the same amount of money . We 're all equals . We 'll draw . Longest takes the east , shortest the west and so forth . Equal enough . I 'll be seeing you gentlemen later . How about an extra 10 million for the first kill ? You stay out of my way , Elkins . I wanna make sure the first kill isn 't you . Relax , would you ? I 'll tell you what , Williams . You kill Elkins first , I 'll give you the money myself . You guys are great . Really great , guys . Huh . Huh ! ( Ronnie ) Now , what could 've done that ? The hunters ? Maybe this isn 't the first time these guys have done this . I think I 'm gonna be sick . What if this island ain 't deserted , huh ? What if we were wasting all that time playing Green Beret when what we should 've been doing is looking for help . The help this guy got ? We don 't need that kind of help . Who knows ? I mean , this island is big enough , right ? We don 't know who or what is out there . If there was a village , we 'd have seen it . Hey , guys ! Now what ? Wow . Look at this . Guys . Do you believe this ? What is it ? It 's gotta be some kind of ancient Greek temple or something . Enough of the archeology tour . We need to keep moving . Yeah , I 'm with you . Crafty bastards . I wonder what you have in store for us next . Where have you little rodents gone ? [ groans ] [ loud groaning ] I 'll be damned . It worked . ( Crick ) We got one of them ? Sounds like we hurt him at least . If he 's dead , we 're gonna need his gun . What ? [ growl ] Okay , that 's not good . Let 's go back the other way . Move ! Williams to Aegeas . Williams to Aegeas . This is Aegeas . Come in . What the hell you guys got going on here ? I got a wooden stake jammed to my leg . This island 's booby trap . Williams , this is Camden . Are you hurt ? Hell , I am hurt ! Do you want us to come and get you ? Williams , I assure you this is not our doing . We 're gonna come and get you . No , I 'm not done here , yet . Williams , out . What the hell was that , huh ? One of them ? I have no idea , but we should keep moving . Yeah . ( Williams ) Don 't move ! You 're all together ? What is this , a hunt or a turkey shoot ? How 's the leg feeling ? It stings a bit . You 're gonna take another shot ? Where 's the sport in that ? You got a 30-second head start . Run ! You got a 20-second head start . [ roar ] Son of a ... Run ! [ shouts ] Mr. Williams , come in . Mr. Williams , this is Aegeas . Are you there ? Over . Something 's going on over there . Are you sure that that island was deserted ? Yes ! Or maybe Mr. Sweet 's man of mystery was a bit more mysterious than he let us to believe . That 's it . I gotta go check this out for myself . You don 't wanna do that . These men paid $ 40 million for an adventure . They don 't wanna be babysat . You heard Williams . You going to the island is a bad idea . He 's right . If we look like we don 't know what we 're doing , we risk losing everything . Fine . Fine . Fine . Your boat , where is it ? Wait a minute . Who are you and what the hell is going on here ? Yeah , what the hell is that thing , huh ? Where is your boat ? We don 't have a boat . How did you get here ? Kidnapped . This game of hunt the humans . We 're the hunted . Is there any other way off this island ? Without a boat , there isn 't . How did you get here ? An archeology expedition . Our ship sank about two months ago . Where 's everyone else ? Dead . From that thing back there ? We gotta keep moving . It 'll be back . ( Camden ) An ex US Commando ? You put my men on an island with a Special Forces psychopath . These men wanted action . That 's what we gave them . Mr. Sweet , guys like Nolan are trained to kill people with leaves and acorns , and you put him on my island with my men in my game ! A mystery man . He 's certainly no mystery to you , is he ? He was under your command ! Did you really think that I wouldn 't check him out ? Sir . The hunters are together now . We at least have one confirmed kill . Did you hear that , Camden ? They 're already celebrating . You worry too much . You let these men take out a US Commando , a Special Forces bad ass , they 'll pay you double . Triple . That 's the high they 're looking for . And that 's good business . Ha ! You heard Mr. Williams . He was ready for this . Deep down this is what they were hoping for it to be . Real . Mr. Sweet , if what you 're telling me is that you think that it 's good for business for one of my men to die on that island at the hands of an ex US Commando , then that is without a doubt the most moronic thing I 've heard come from you yet . Mr. Winters , I want you to radio Mr. Williams . I want you to tell him that the hunt is off . That we are gonna come pick him up . I 'm ending this . We 're gonna give them their money back . We are going to plan anew . And Mr. Sweet , I could care less what your grudge with Nolan is . If you have any more plans for revenge , you do it on your own time . You got that ? Did I overhear talk of giving money back ? It 's just talk . That 's all it is . I hope so . He 'll cool off when he realizes I 'm right . What the hell happened here ? The savages killed Williams . That 's what happened . Our pray didn 't do this . How do you know that ? An animal did this . So much for being alone on a deserted island , huh ? Boy , this Camden is just full of surprises . Yeah , well , this is over . This has to end now . Elkins to Aegeas . Elkins to Aege ... What are you doing ? Hey ! You gone crazy ? They 'll come back here . You completely lost your mind . I think we need to put a pin in this little joint until we can get Camden here to explain what the hell is going on . Williams is dead . They killed him . That 's what 's going on . It 's more of a justification for what we 're trying to do here , and you wanna go back to the boat now ? The two of you are serious ? They didn 't do this . You 're pathetic . The both of you . You say you want adventure . You say you want something new . You 're even willing to pay out the nose for it , but the minute you get a whiff on any real danger , you 're on the first ferry back to the country club . For God 's sake , Sean , Williams is dead . Don 't you get it ? This isn 't a game anymore . You wanna go back ? Fine . Swim back with your tail between your legs . Go flirt with the old man 's woman . You may have spent $ 10 million to lounge around on a rusted old freighter , but I didn 't . I 'm gonna finish this . All right . All right . So the hunt is on . Fine ! You two hunt on . I 'm gonna see if I can make my way back to the ship . All right , everybody stop . That hunter , I don 't think he made it . I gotta get back there . Are you crazy ? That thing is back there . His gun may be laying there , a radio , something . It 's worth the risk . Hold on , all right ? What about the expedition , huh ? This island showed up on satellite mapping about three months ago . Uncharted . We mounted an expedition in the hopes that this might be the fabled location of a lost Greek temple . The final resting place of certain relics . The sword of Hercules , things like that . A real find . Career making . Unfortunately , more of the mythology proved to be true than we bargained for . Yeah . Well , that thing is a pretty deadly myth . Well . It 's more dangerous at night . The hydra stalks it 's prey using heat and movement . Heat and movement ? Like a snake . As the air cools off , we 'll be easier to find . It 's a kind of a no-win scenario if you ask me . If we move , the hydra gets us . If we don 't , the hunters do . Well , now your hunters are being hunted , too . Hold on , all right ? I mean , no guns , no supplies , no nothing ? No guns . Computers , survey equipment . I salvaged what I could . Where ? Hidden . That way about a half mile up . Ronnie , go get it . We 'll meet back here . And stick together . If I don 't show up within the hour , get as deep in the interior as you can get . And then what ? You can 't just leave us . I 'll be back . I promise . Go see what she 's got . Anything we can use to call for help or use as a weapon . Nolan . I promise . Gwen . ( Camden ) They 're still not answering . They probably don 't wanna be interrupted . We have lost their GPS signals ! There 's a glitch in the system . Relax . No . No , no , no , not likely . I have to go in . Give them one more hour . Allow them the chance to call in . They 're probably maintaining radio silence for all you know . One hour . They don 't call in , I 'll go to the island myself . Okay , fine . One hour . This is Aegeas . Calling Mr. Williams . Come in , Mr. Williams . Come in . This is Aegeas . This is it ? No gun ? Just a broken walkie . That 's all we get . Can you fix that ? I don 't know . Maybe . What ? Quiet . Wait here . Say goodnight , sweetheart . Psst . Nolan , where were you ? Everything 's good , but we should split . Come on . What are you doing ? Great . There 's nothing here that 's gonna help us . We were just a research team . That 's it ? Well , there 's one less hunter to worry about . Great . A bunch of junk and a broken walkie-talkie . Next time the creature comes , we can attack it with transistors . What are you planning on doing with that ? What do you think ? Call for help . It 's a short wave . You 'll only be calling your hunters . That 's exactly what we do . The only way off this island is their boat . We need them to bring their boat to us . Then what ? Stick out a thumb and hitch a ride ? I 'll lead them into the jungle . You get on the boat and get off this island . And leave you here with them ? I 'll be here when you come back with the cavalry . Right . [ radio interference ] You got somethin ' ? ( Winters ) Less two . Two hunters off line . We still haven 't been able to reach Williams . Unit Commander Sweet . This is Task Officer Nolan . Unit Commander Sweet . Task Officer Nolan . Are you there ? Come in , Sweet . Nolan . I wasn 't expecting to hear from you . How are you enjoying the island ? Why don 't you drop by and see for yourself ? No , thank you . Is Mr. Williams there or did you borrow a walkie-talkie ? Mr. Williams isn 't here right now . I 'd take a message but I don 't think he 'll get it . You didn 't contact me to play games , Nolan . What 's on your mind ? Are you kidding me ? I love playing games . You have your games , I have mine . Two of your hunters are dead , Sweet . And the other two don 't have much longer . I 'm listening . So , here 's the new game . You come to the island . See who finds the hunters first . If I find them , they die . If you do ... If I come to the island , I 'm coming for you . I 'm counting on it . I 'm sure you are . Oh , Mr. Nolan , whatever little trap you 're planning , just remember I 've always been one step ahead of you . Is that Mr. Kaplan standing behind you ? Ms. Russo next to him ? I look forward to seeing you all shortly . Two hunters dead . Two of my hunters are dead ! Your little vendetta has jeopardized this entire operation . You get over to that island ! And you get those other two hunters back here ! Safely ! What is going on here , huh ? What am I doing here ? How did I get put between some macho showdown between you and your boyfriend there ? He was my commanding officer in Iraq . He did things I didn 't wanna be a part of anymore . I fragged him . Left him for dead . Somehow he made it back alive , and I ended up in prison . I got nothing to do with this . I shouldn 't even be here . Shut up . What 's going on ? He 's got GPS . They 've been tracking us . I don 't know how . Implants , something . But now there 's no ambush . There 's no sneaking in and stealing their boat . Damn , I don 't know how I missed that . Of course they 'd be tracking us . But they 're not tracking you . They don 't even know you 're here . So , I 'm your ace in the hole ? Okay , this is what we 're gonna do . No . What do you mean " no " ? Why should I risk my life for you people ? Like he said , they don 't even know that I 'm here . And I survived the hydra for a very long time before you got here on my own . But we can get off this island . You can go home . I 've got nothing left to go home to . I have lost everything here . And I am not leaving this island without getting what I came for . And that 's what ? I 'll help you kill this man , this hunter , if you do something for me in return . What ? Kill the hydra . ( Camden ) Sweet 's going to the island . We could just leave . Just pull anchor and go . We 're not going anywhere . We don 't know what happened , yet . We have their money . We could just disappear . We don 't have their money . What do you mean ? They paid us upfront . No , the money is in a escrow account . They paid us 10 % upfront . The rest is payable upon their safe return . Really ? About time one of you guys showed up . This is a disaster . It 's a complete disaster . What are you talking about ? Williams is dead . Trotta 's gone commando on us and he 's probably dead . What kind of island did you morons drop us off on ? Shut up , Elkins . Show me where Williams ' body is . I 'm not going back in there ! Fine . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Exactly what you asked . I just wanna make sure you don 't make off with the boat . You 're gonna pay for this . Untie me now . Do you know who you 're dealing with ? On this island I don 't care who you are . Now , shut up . I need to think . This cave contains the chamber of Zeus , and in it the sword of Hercules . This sword wields the power of gods . If we retrieve it , we can kill the hydra . Nolan , tell me you 're not buying this . Sweet is coming to this island right now . I help you , you help me , right ? Right . Here 's the plan . Ten minutes from ship to beach . It 's probably an hour walk from there to here on a straight track . Since he 's got a GPS signal , he 's probably no more that 15 , 20 minutes behind us . So he 'll probably get here before we get in , find this thing and get out . I 'll get you your sword , but we have to make our stand here . You wait here . You see him go in , you follow . Surprise him from behind . And if we all work together , we can overpower him . Yeah , right . If we 're bulletproof . How do we find this sword ? I don 't know . I really think I should go in with you . Idol chambers are usually fairly consistent . There will be an altar . The sword 'll be hidden and there will be a test . What kind of test ? The test of faith . You 'll have to do something that you don 't think it 's possible . How do we kill it ? According to legend , Hercules ' sword cauterized each head as he chopped them off , keeping them from growing back as long as the head is separated from the body . Nolan , please tell me you are not buying this . You follow him , get his attention . I 'll take care of the rest . Alone ? You 're not going in there alone . Hey . You might wanna get that rock , so you can hit him on the head . ( Gwen ) Come on . Come on , baby . I know you 're right there . Come to papa . Come on . Got you . Gwen , what 's that ? This stuff is ancient . Looks like we 're in the right place . Yeah . Right place to get eaten . [ rumbling ] Oh , God , it 's coming . It 's just a tremor . It 's okay . You guys smell that ? Sulphur . What does that mean ? That means this island is volcanic . We 're probably close to lava tubes . Let 's move . Nolan didn 't do this . I 'll be damned if I know what did . [ rumbling ] Oh , God . What is that ? I don 't know . Sweet . Sweet , are you there ? Yeah . What 's going on over there ? Did you feel that ? Yeah , this island is a little unstable . What 's your status ? I have Elkins . Williams is a confirmed casualty . As far as I know , Trotta and Broughton are still alive . You said that Williams is a confirmed casualty . Are you sure ? Do you have a body ? I have something . What do you mean you have something ? Talking about the fact that there 's something else on this island . What does that mean ? What do you mean " something else " ? Sweet out . Ugh ! What are you doing over there ? Nothing . [ beep beep beep ] This looks like a natural lava vent . Natural ? It looks like somebody just built this thing . I don 't know . I have a bad feeling about this , guys . You have a bad feeling about everything . Yeah , and I haven 't been wrong yet , have I ? What now ? What did she say ? Idol chamber . Altar . It 'll be hidden . And a test . I don 't think this is just here as a decoration . I 'm betting this is the test . What ? You think it 's in there ? A test of faith . Doing something you don 't believe is possible . So someone is supposed to stick their hands in there and fish around ? This is crazy . We 're being blackmailed by some raving lunatic . And Sweet is on his way right now . Well , you were almost right . N ice plan , Nolan . Back yourself into a corner you can 't get out of . But you never were very smart . How did I beat you back to base when you let me to die in Tikrit ? [ whispers ] Where 's Valerie ? Mr. Kaplan , Mr. Nolan and I are having a conversation . You 're interrupting . [ shouts ] Did you go back to that village ? Try to play the hero ? Tactical mistakes . I 'm sure you told quite a tale to our General . Most of which was true by the way . You did try to kill your superior officer . You murdered those people . They were terrorists . They were women and children . Details . They were a blight on society like you and your newfound friends here . When Camden came to me with this hunting venture , I knew you 'd be the perfect choice . I didn 't know I 'd have the pleasure of killing you myself . Nolan ! I couldn 't find a rock . Where is the sword ? [ roaring ] Get it . Now . Nolan ! Nolan ! [ screams ] [ shouts ] Gwen , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . I guess we can leave now , right ? It 's not over , yet . Come on . I hope that ship is still here . The sooner we get off this island the better . I don 't think it 's gonna be around too much longer . I agree . ( Camden ) Mr. Sweet , come in . Mr. Sweet , this is Camden . Come in . He 's not answering . Something 's happening on that island . Give me those . Here . Mr. Nolan . Seems the hunted has bested the hunters . I 'm impressed . Kudos to you . Jeez , thanks . Now , tell us who else is on board . Come down , Mr. Nolan . Surely we can think of a better ending than this . My ending is that you pay for what you 've done . Well , you see , I don 't like that ending . Maybe we could drop you somewhere and go our separate ways . No , that can 't happen . Tell him about the money , Vincent . We have money . We could split it . Ten million dollars on this boat . You people and your money . It 's just us , Winters and a few servants . Shut up , Dixie . Where is this Mr. Winters ? On the bridge . Go find the radio room . We gotta put an SOS out . What about them ? They 're not going anywhere . Here . Mr. Nolan , it 's a long trip . I 'm sure we 'll have more time to discuss our options . [ clears throat ] Heading , Captain ? Sardinia . Sardinia it is . [ distant roar ] [ Dixie screams ] Mayday . Mayday . S O S. S O S. Can anyone hear me , please ? [ roar ] [ Dixie screams ] Mayday . S O S. Please . [ shouts ] Gwen ! Gwen . Nolan ! Nolan ! Nolan ! Nolan ! Nola ... Gwen ! Let , let go of me . What the hell is that thing ? Does it matter ? We just gotta get off this ship . She 's right . Stay away . You brought that thing here . Gwen , where is the sword ? I don 't know . Shut up ! Everybody shut up . I want somebody to tell me what the hell that thing is and how it got on my ship . [ shouts ] Gwen , get out of there . Move , now ! [ shouts ] [ roar ] Move ! Hey ! [ shouts ] How many times do I have to kill you ? ( Gwen ) Look out ! What just happened ? It lost its head . Come on . It 's okay . I 'm okay . [ rumbling ] Please ! Please , don 't leave me here ! Please , come back . Please ! What 'd they say ? The Sardinian authorities were very accommodating . Especially when I told them what goods I wanted to declare . Where did you get that ? So maybe we stay here for a while . Absolutely not . You can take me to Rome or Florence , but I think I 've had enough of islands for now . Wherever you prefer . Subtitles by LeapinLar

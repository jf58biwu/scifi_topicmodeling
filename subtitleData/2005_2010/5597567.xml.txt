 So , on endurance tests , two of your copies , three and five ... are giving very good data . Actually , I came because I thought you might do ... with a more current version of myself . Because the sample I gave you may have been ... Severe inhibition of pleasure responses . So , with my improved attitude , I think I ... We 've everything we need from you . Well , how about royalties ? There 's a certain question of property rights involved . Potentially ... Property rights ? - Trouble , boss ? - Right here . Take it out . Too bad about their shutting down D-Section . No one knew about that corridor . Maybe a double agent . I don 't understand why you keep using this one , Scaphandra . Just remember to watch your feet . You lost them here ? I like the transplants , by the way . Yes , so do I. - You will need me for the return ? - Of course . Wait for me at that point in three days . Ready ? Scaphandra ! Scaphandra . You wanna kill her ? All right . I think we 're ready to start . You 've caused way too much , buddy . You 're one tough little cookie . Let 's see how crusty . What do you say ? - Eat it . - Now take it easy . Scaphandra , you 're overdoing it , you know . I mean , you could die of this sort of thing . Now you know we can 't do that , Twikka . Our friend here knows things . How about I keep a copy of her and I let you ... Well , you can mark up your original , as long as I 've got a clean copy . You really make me sick . Untie her . Aeon . You 're in on this . No , Scaphandra . She knows you 're not . Scaphandra , we 'll talk later . She 's already a double agent . Your operation is finished . My work offends you . Why ? Human beings are not so unique . Just a random arrangement of amino acids . It suits me . Yes , it does . These people you 're copying are already superfluous . You 're trafficking in excess . The issue is not excess but access . Others take away reproductive rights . I grant them . How very progressive . So you can go gleefully multiplying yourself into oblivion . Well , why not ? Although , since you 're here ... the standard method of procreation does suddenly seem appealing . You are so charming , Trevor . Aeon , this doesn 't concern you . You 're not going to interfere with my work . What makes it so important ? I 'm a doctor . My reasons are confidential . Fine . Then you 'll know why I 'm shutting you down . I have you any way anyone could ever imagine . Make yourself presentable . - He did a good job . - Yes . You 're me . Lovely . How do you feel ? And what about the lab ? I 'm fine . The lab is easy . Waiting for you , for three days , will be hard . These things take time . Crush his soul . Impale him upon his own ego . - Are you ready to do this ? - I am . You 'd better be . - When I 'm done ... - Kill you . This is Interior Control . You are five increments from hooligan status . And counting . Three , two , one ... Nothing that happens between us matters . I 've heard that one before . That sofa 's very comfortable , don 't you find ? Yes , it 's amazing . I copied you . But you know that . You may as well enjoy the luxury of letting go . You can afford to , you 're extraneous , and in the end , disposable . Am I behaving atrociously ? Perhaps . But no one need ever know . Aeon , I want you . Come on , lover . I know what you want . So is this more like it ? Or is this ? What 's the matter ? Is it my clothes ? I 'll change . You have changed . This is all wrong . Trevor , I don 't know what to say . Good . Because I don 't want to hear it . Take me , Trevor . Do it . Just don 't be here in the morning when I wake up . What is it ? She 's different . Did something go wrong ? No , it 's not possible . What else could it mean ? What 's she doing here ? You don 't know what I want . That makes two of us . It 's good not to be scared , isn 't it ? I wouldn 't want you any other way . You still don 't trust me . Should I ? Do you ? Aeon . - She 's out there somewhere , isn 't she ? - Yes . What do you think she 's doing right now ? She 's probably planning to destroy me utterly . Or is that your job ? I don 't know anymore . You 're her , aren 't you ? You 're the real Aeon . - Why did you make the switch ? - Trevor , it 's over . It 's over . Damn you , Trevor . You wretched egotist . How dare you subject me to this ? Don 't flatter yourself , you freak . So , I 'm not the only one playing both sides of the street . Damn it ! You 're screwing up my mission . Why did you come ? He stole a sample of me . I can 't let him make a copy . It 's okay . I 've taken care of it . The last thing I want is another one of you . All right . We can get out of here . Tonight . As we planned . No problem . I 'll be there . Meet me at the border . Bring this . We cross together . I need you and you need me . Impossible . Here ? But what 's this ? Give me my gun . Now get out of here ! Aeon . Thank God . - What are you doing here ? - What do you mean ? You told me to come . You said to bring this . Yes , of course . I had to be sure that you weren 't a copy . - But you said ... - Yes , I know . - Well ? Are you ready to go ? - I 'm ready . These things take time . Cross the border with S , then kill her . Did you bring my gun ? You don 't need it . Come on . It 's time . Stop ! Stop ! What are you doing ? - Are you all right ? - It 's Aeon Flux , sir . - You ordered ... - Shut up . What ? You ordered ? Trevor ? Yes . I decided that as long as she 's out there ... she 'll always be a threat to us . You decided ? It 's because she 's out there that I 'm here with you . Is that how it is ? Well . Come . You 're Aeon , not her . It 's what you 've wanted me to believe . It doesn 't matter , Trevor . She 's already gone . I 'll be back . No one 's going to kill you . So , I thought I was going to have to come get you . Why didn 't you cross with Scaphandra ? Now you 're stuck here . You forgot our plan . I 'm crossing with you . No . I 'm not finished with him , yet . What is it ? The stars in your eyes . They 're stolen . - Things have changed . - Trevor ? You were supposed to mess with his head . His desire is not his alone . If you won 't cross with me , I 'll kill you here . Maybe it 's better that way . Scaphandra was supposed to give you something . This . There are things you don 't know . I know that you won 't kill me . You 'd kill me . That was the plan . Yes . Yours to begin with . To make him hurt . Take a stand ! - Okay , pretty one . - Watch that . Goodbye . No ! What do you mean , you can 't reprogram ? I want Turret 12 shut down , now . Well , find the codes , damn it ! There 's no time ! No ! Stop the guns , I tell you , stop the guns ! Aeon . Turret 12 is now off-line , sir . But we have the fugitive in our sights . Let her go . Let her go .

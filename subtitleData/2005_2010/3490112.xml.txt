Are you getting this ? OFFICER : Yes , sir . There 's something here . There has to be . A guy like that who works for STC , with that kind of clearance on that kind of project , he wouldn 't just steal something on a whim . . This was planned . This was thought out . Look at this Who does this ? Who leaves this out like this ? Fake ID . Looks like our boy was planning a trip . Yeah , and he left in a hurry , too . Got a laundry list of aliases . ( CAMERA CLICKS ) Caleb , look . ? What does he want with you No , it 's not me . It 's my family . Allison , I 'm sending you a list of aliases . . I want you to cross-reference it with the manifest from Flight 507 Can you do that ? b . Gentlemen , I have Cale . Put him on the box What do we have , Caleb ? High probability suspect already took an international flight . We have a match . There 's a Jesus-Ernesto Ramiro listed on Flight 507 . I 'm coming in . I 'll be there in half an hour . ? What is he doing Check the manifest . Sure . VAN ELDEN : Caleb 's famil y might be on that flight . t ? Can you freeze tha . VAN ELDEN : I was right , that 's his wife and daughter My God . Get me Major Dylan . ALLISON : Yes , sir . Daniel knows that I 'd head up any operation to bring him in . And he 's banking on the fact that I won 't jeopardize a fligh with my own family on it . DANIEL ON COMPUTER : Greetings . I can assure you that I mean no one any harm . . I 'm doing what I 'm doing for the safety of my fello Americans and of the world I have been forced to act because my government has decided to militarize the Alpha String Project . I cannot allow this to happen . This is not a political statement or a compunction of mine against the United States of America . This is about survival . We are dealing with the very fabric of time and space . The instability of the device and the parameters that we do not yet understand could bring about a catastrophe of universal proportions . It is delicate work , work that I alone can finish . This is not the kind of project that generals and senators should be directing at this stage of its development . Perhaps at no stage of its development . But regardless , I will not stand by and allow minds that do not understand . attempt to apply unfinished work to ill-conceived plans I know you will think me crazy , I know you will fear my intentions , but I have no choice . I have been backed into a corner . And one day you will realize that this is the only course of action that I can take . I will take the steps necessary to accomplish my task . I hope that you understand enough to not risk following me . What have you got up your sleeve ? ( SIGHS ) It 's not like he didn 't want to come . That 's not the point . He was looking forward to this trip as much as we were . I know . And you know what ? You 're right . We are gonna have a great time , even if it 's just the two of us . Okay ? Okay . Go ahead . Thanks . Hey , my name 's Liam . Hi . Is everything okay with your dad ? He deplaned quickly . Look , Liam ... I know . I know what you 're thinking . You 're just standing here in the aisle , minding your own business , ? and some weird guy won 't leave you alone , right Well , I 'm air security . But I wouldn 't want the bad guys to find out . So why are you telling me ? Well , I wouldn 't want a pretty girl like you to feel unsafe . MARTIN : Hey , air security . Try hitting on someone your own age . Sit down . Creepy . Yeah , I wouldn 't worry about it . There 's one on every flight . I 'll keep an eye on him for you . MAN ON RADIO : Sky Wing 507 be advised there is a possible security threat aboard your aircraft . Center , Sky Wing 507 . Possible security threat onboard . Anything further , Center ? Sky Wing 507 , roger . Standby for fighter intercept and escort . Radar vectors for intercept , turn right , heading 150 . Center , roger . Right , heading 150 . Honey , look . . Isn 't that beautiful ? That 's so pretty ? Where 's the shop CAPTAIN : Attention , this is your Captain speaking . We have an indication in the cockpit that one of our hydraulic systems may have a minor fault . While this is no cause for alarm , as a precautionary procedure , we will be returning to the airport . I 'm turning on the " Fasten Seatbelt " light . Please return to your seat and remain seated until we are safely back on the ground , which should be within the hour . Is that bad ? No , I 'm sure it 's just precautionary . It 's Caleb . Did you get the photographs from Daniel 's house of the girl ? I 'm running them through your system as we speak . I 'll let you know as soon as I have a positive ID . All right , what about Flight 507 ? . They 've been turned around We have two fighter jets escorting them back to LA . No , no , they can 't do that Get me Quinn . Right away . Sir , it 's Caleb . Caleb . You 've got to call off the fighter intercept . Caleb , you know protocol just as well as I do . I know , but if he sees the fighters , he 'll know that we 're onto him . Quinn , please . You 've got to break protocol on this one . Look , Caleb , I know your family is on that plane , . but there 's nothing I can do m . Come on , Quinn , you know he 's not going to do anything unless we make hi We can bring him in safely without incident . . I can 't take that risk The priority right now is getting him into custody and returning the Alpha String Project safely . . That 's what I 'm trying to do Mom . I see it . There 's our escort . ( ALL MURMURING ) Don 't you think we were intercepted awfully fast for what 's only supposed to be a " possible security threat " ? Fighter Intercept , this is Sky Wing 507 , on 121.5 . Stenton Center , Sky Wing 507 . We 've been intercepted by the two fighters , but cannot raise them on 121.5 . t WOMAN ON RADIO : Be advised that the intercept aircraf are on a secure tactical frequency . Center , roger . Secure tactical frequency and no joy on 121.5 . What 's up with that ? If this is intercept protocol , it 's new to me . ( WHIRRING ) There 's an electromagnetic signal coming from the plane . It 's possible Dr. Winter could be trying to activate . That 's why you 've got to get those planes away from there . Quinn , come on . You read the same file as I did . t . Daniel 's a pacifis . He wants to protect the teleporter , not use it Once the device is activated , how long do we have ? A minute , at the most . I told you , he 's just trying to keep it safe . Do not do anything rash . AIDE : Sir . What ? It 's the President . Yes , sir . I know , sir . Yes , Mr. President . Yes , sir . Flight 507 is expendable . For the love of Go d , don 't do this . Hang up the phone . Quinn , Quinn ! My wife and my daughter are on that plane . Do not do anything . I 'm tell ... Tell Major Dylan to ... To launch missiles when ready . What the hell are they doing out there ? Fighter aircraft have assume what looks like an attack formation . Center , what the hell is going on ? Are they going to shoot us down ? n . Take evasive actio Assume crash positions . ( PASSENGERS CLAMORING ) Get down . AUTOMATED VOICE : Target has been neutralized . It 's done , Mr. President . ( SOBBING ) It 's not our call . Come on , we 've got t o prepare a briefing for the President . Wait . I don 't have confirmation . ? What are you talking about The missile , we don 't have a confirmed hit . The plane 's transponde r , find it . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Yeah ? ALLISON : Look , there 's something that I think you should know . We don 't have a confirmati of the missile strike . I don 't understand . Well , as far as the people here are concerned , the missile never hit the plane . So where is it ? Well , we don 't know , but we 've traced the plane 's transponder to a debris field in Palmdale . Quinn and Van Elden are on their way . If you leave now , you can get there before they do . Allison , what debris field are you talking about ? ( THUNDERING ) This is a secured site . Yeah , yeah , I 'm STC . Go ahead . ? Where are the bodies You 've missed them . They were shipped out hours ago . Hours ? This plane took off an hour and a half ago . Not this plane . They found this last night . Last night ? That 's right . Son of a bitch ! I told you to back tho se planes off . It didn 't have to end like this . You know damn well I don 't call those kinds of shots . . There 's protocol , and this administration isn t about to stray from that Caleb ... Following that order was ... Go home , Caleb . This is no place for you right now . How does a plane crash hundreds of miles from where it was shot down ? And how do you shoot a plane down if your missiles don 't hit it ? VAN ELDEN : There 's no proof ... This is my daughter 's bag . She carried it on our plane . . I know what flight that is What I don 't know is how a plane can cra sh before it takes off . All right . Something happened up there that we think may be related to the technology that was stolen . The Alpha String Project ? Yes . Now , there 's a chance , as odd as it may seem , there is a chance that your family is still alive . Come with me . What you 're about to learn is highly classified . The Alpha String Project is the world 's first fully functional teleporter . Teleportation ? This is our only test conducted with a living organism . What just happened there ? QUINN : Dr. Winter developed a way to open up a wormhole . to another dimension which we call null-space It 's a kind of limbo that runs parallel to our world . When you leave null-space , . you can re-emerge at any point in the universe Based on our day-old debris field , the wormhole must also have time travel properties . The technology is so new , we barely understand it ourselves . And this teleportation thing he took it on the plane ? It 's been confirmed . The control unit was found in the wreckage . Winter must have teleported the plane out of harm 's way before the missiles hit . You said my family might still be alive . We picked up the teleporter 's signal coming from null-space . The only explanation is that the plane went in , but it didn 't come out . So your family and the rest of the passengers could be stranded in another dimension . Well , let 's open another wormhole and go get them . QUINN : Yeah , well , that 's the problem . The teleporter only ha s two controllers and Dr. Winter stole them both from the lab . This is the control unit we found in the wreckage . But there 's another one out there ? VAN ELDEN : We assu me he took them both . No . No , he wouldn 't risk it . The other one is still out there . Caleb , wait ! I 'm going to find it . Let him go . . We can 't let him head up an investigation . He 's too close to this thing That 's exactly why he might find it . It 's the only chance he has of saving his family . Allison , Caleb . You got an identity on that woman in Daniel 's photographs ? s . I 'm all over it . Her name is Jasmine Steven I 'm sending the address right now . Hey , Caleb , what 's going on ? Long story . Have Myers meet me on site . Sarah ? Sarah ? Mom ? Are you okay ? What the hell ? Where are we ? I don 't know . What is that ? I have no idea . Does anyone know where we are ? You look out the window ? What is that ? BERMAN : Where the hell is everyone else ? Just calm down . Are we dead ? TODD : It looked like they were going to shoot us down . DORIS : What happened after that ? t . TODD : I don 't know . I must have blacked ou If we 're dead , where 's everyone else ? Maybe they went to hel l . TODD : Maybe we 're in hell . Nobody 's in hell . Just calm down , all right ? Calm down ? Okay , ma 'am ... He 's telling us to calm down . Yo , panic isn 't doin g a lot of good , lady . ? Okay , is anyone hurt There 's nobody els e up front either . TODD : Are we even still in the air ? Mom ? People don 't disappear . Why don 't you go have a look then ? ( RUMBLING ) Honey ... MARTIN : Put your seatbelts on . g ? I 'm going to be right back . Where are you goin ? Just stay there . Mom . Where are you going Stay there . Ma 'am , please sit back down . TODD : Lady , where are you going ? Sit down . CHOPPER PILOT : STC command this is Blue Bird . We are five miles from our target zone . Affirmative , Blue Bird . We 're ready to begin our scan . What 's your status ? TESSLOR : We 're detecting an atmospheric anomaly near the coordinates where the plane disappeared . I 'm sending in two chopper for a closer read . y ? What kind of atmospheric anomal Some kind of electromagnetic charge . I 've never seen anything like it . Patch me in when you have a visual and stay on speaker . Yes , sir . Get me a visual . PILOT : We 're experiencing some kind of nasty turbulence up here . Sir , visual is up . Tesslor , what are we looking at ? TESSLOR : It looks like a giant wormhole , but it 's interacting with the atmosphere . PILOT : STC Command , the turbulence is getting more severe . Blue Bird , do you need to abort ? I repeat , Blue Bird , do you need to abort ? d ? What the hell just happene . We just lost two helicopters How ? I think the wormhole that teleported Daniel 's plane is too large to close . It apparently created an electrical vortex between our dimension and null-space . Where is it located ? Just outside Twentynine Palms . r . And it 's getting large Caleb , your family ? They 're telling me there 's a chance they 're still alive . I need to believe that . Really ? Damn it , I hope that 's true . Thanks , man . Is this the place ? Yeah , Jasmine Stevens , works as a legal assistant at some law firm . Used to be a receptionist . Sources say her and Daniel have been dating on and off for about six years . He spends the night here pretty regularly . Yeah , I bet . ? Any activity None that I could see , but I just got here . Whoa ! Door 's open . Federal agents . Freeze ! Put the guns down , now . Hey , guys , take it easy . Take it easy . We 're federal agents . I 'm going to reach and get my ID , okay ? All right ? Okay . We got a call about a break-in . Where 's Jasmine Stevens ? She 's upstairs , in the bedroom . She 's not looking so good . ( MOANS ) n . Caleb , this woman needs medical attentio Myers , gun ! Jasmine , can you hear me ? Did Daniel ever mention the Alpha String Project to you ? Did he ever mention a second controller ? Do you know where it is ? The ... Please , Jasmine . Did he give it to you ? Jasmine , this is important . There are a lot of lives at stake . Do you know where it is ? The bank . Bank ? Good , good . It 's in a bank . Do you know which bank ? This is Sky Wing Flight 507 to the tower . Do you copy ? Repeat , we have lost our crew and the aircraft appears to be on autopilot . This is Flight 507 , can anyone out the re read me , over ? What about the navigation systems ? Can you figure out where we are ? Altimeter says we 're at sea level , it 's not much help . ( WHOOSHING ) Okay . Okay . Let 's just try to think this through logically . What do we know ? We were about a half-hour ou from the airport , when we saw those jets . Okay . We know the radio has no signal . We know the instruments aren 't working . What else ? What about some of the theories they 're throwin around back there ? What ? That we 're dead ? That we 're in heaven or hell , I don 't think so , come on . ( WHOOSHING ) ( RATTLING ) What is that ? I don 't know , but it 's getting closer . ( PHONE RINGING ) ? Caleb , what 's going on Myers is dead . Stevens is dead . Oh , my God . Send a clean-up team ASAP . . This whole thing stink s , Allison . We got a leak f . Someone tipped them of From now on , you don 't disclose my move to anyone , you understand ? Anyone . I understand . . Now , I need you to check out Daniel 's bank records for me I need to know if he 's got a safe deposit box , anything in a vault . Right away . ? All right . How are you doing over there b . Something bad is happening , Cale People are getting really nervous . Is that Caleb ? Yes . Put him on speaker . ALLISON : Caleb , you 're on speaker . Caleb , it 's Joshua . The teleporter 's signal is getting weaker . We can hold it for approximately two hours . And what happens if we lose it ? The coordinates will become guesswork . We 'll have no chance of reaching the plane . We have to find that controller . . All right , keep me updated Did you see anything up there ? No , nothing is working . . Radio 's dead The only thing I could think of is the good doctor . What do you think ? It 's time we found out . Take this . Yeah . Dr. Winter . Could you come with me , please ? I 'm sorry . Have we met ? Air security . We just need to talk to you for a few minutes , sir . . There 's no problem . Please Thank you . TESSLOR : We think there might be a way to close the vortex . The force field surrounding the vortex is electromagnetic . We could potentially reverse polarity by releasing a massive electromagnetic pulse bomb in the atmosphere . How long until it 's ready ? The plane is in range . The EMP is ready to go . Well , then move on it . What is this ? You know damn well what this is , don 't you ? Before those jets showed up , we were heading back because of a security breach . That security breach was you . That 's nonsense . You stole sensitive technology from the United States government . That is preposterous . You brought it aboard this plane , didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? ( GUN COCKS ) Don 't insult my intelligence . Three quarters of the passengers on this plane have disappeared . Flight crew is gone . We don 't know where the hell we are . Now , can you do something about this or not ? . Go on and shoot me and we 'll never find out Not yet . Let 's go . Come on , Doc , you better start talking . ? May I have your attention , please Being the only law enforcement offici al on this plane , I feel it 's incumbent upon m to inform you we have a fugitive in our midst . Dr. Winter is going to tell us exactly what 's going on . Aren 't you , Doctor ? ( CLEARS THROAT ) This plane has been teleported into an alternate dimension . . ( WOMAN SCOFFS ) Give me a freaking break Stored in the cargo area of this aircraft is an invention of mine . An invention that I borrowed this morning from the labs of STC . STC , what 's that ? It 's a branch of the government that creates new technologies . Mrs. Smith , I 'm sorry to have involved you and your family . But I had hoped your husband would have shown restraint when it came to his own family . Do not go there ! C , If you hadn 't stol en the device from ST d . none of this would have happene Actually , what would have happened would have been far worse . It would have been turned into a weapon . It 's your fault they were trying to shoot us down . If I had not activated my invention in time , they would have . And everyone else ? Where are they ? The teleporter had never been tested on such a large subject . . Apparently , only those closest to my control unit successfully made the trip Oh , my God . You killed them . You son of a bitch ! You either sit down , or I will shoot you myself . Sit down . It was my only option . Please forgive me , I thought I was saving the whole plane . So , what is that thing out the window ? It 's getting closer . We 're being pulled into a vortex . Anything that is pulled into it is crushed instantly . How long do we have ? I haven 't calculated that yet . I was interrupted . BERMAN : Well , get us the hell out of here . I mean , whatever you d id to put us here , get us back out . Now ! I 'm afraid I can 't at the moment . The teleporter 's dead . CLAIRE : What ? So we 're going to die ? Is that what you 're saying ? No , we are not going to die . It is possible that one of the power cells is damaged . I need to get into the baggage hold so that I can replace it . . Look , just tell us what we need to do If we close the wormhole , will we lose the teleporter 's signal ? Possibly . TESSLOR : At this point we don 't know . We 'll have to risk it . We have to stop it . PILOT : This is Ghost Flight . Pulse bomb away . Sir , the magnetic field is growing stronger . TESSLOR : Ghost Flight , get out of there . Sorry , sir , we lost the plane . TESSLOR : It didn 't work . The vortex destroyed the plane . Right now , we estimate it at approximately 100 yards in diameter , and it 's getting larger . It 's heading straight for East Burrough . ( THUNDERING ) ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) ( BABY COOING ) ( THUNDERING ) ( WHOOSHING ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( BABY CRYING ) CALEB : Allison , what 's going on ? The EMP didn 't work , and the vortex , it 's ... . It 's growing by the minute It just completely destroy the town of East Burrough . Where are you ? I 'm on route to the first bank . Call ahead , I need full clearance to get into that vault . I 'm already ahead of you , but you have to be careful , Caleb . This thing is heading right for you . Not a problem , I 've got Allison Curran watching my back . No pressure . REPORTER ON TV : The Global Weather Division is still at a loss to explain what is causing this devastating phenomenon , a combination of lightning storm and tornado that appears unstoppable . In the wake of East Burrough 's destruction , residents are choking the freeways , by the thousands . Hundreds of neighboring communities have been evacuated , turning them into virtual ghost towns . ( BANGING ON DOOR ) Coming . . That was quick . I need to see your vault Yeah , it 's just this way . I 'm surprised you guys are still out . . I sent my employees home a half-hour ago Pretty crazy stuff out there , huh ? Yeah . I need the safe deposit box of Daniel Winter . Account number 9002501545 . Of course . Usually we never do this , but you must have friend s in high places , huh ? Yeah , you could say that . That 's it . According to the floor plan that leads to baggage . All right . Okay . s . Once I 'm down there , it shouldn 't take long to swap out the power cell Yeah , well , I hate to break it to you , Doc , but there 's no way you 're gonna fit down there . TODD : Who else is gonna go ? I 'll do it . No , no . Absolutely not . Mom , please , I 'm the only one who will fit . u . I won 't risk losing yo She either goes down there or we all die . Mom , he 's right . If we don 't fix this transporter , we 're all dead anyways . It 's all right . It 's not difficult to replace a dead power cell . You need to be very , very careful . There 's a lot of power surging through the system . How much ? A lot . But don 't worry . I 'll walk you through it . Don 't worry . Don 't worry , Mom . Okay . Okay , careful . CALEB : It 's got to be in here somewhere , man , keep looking . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( SHUSHING ) Agent Smith , what a surprise . Don 't move . Okay , I 'm here . Do you see a large silver trunk ? Yeah . That 's it . Undo the latch and lift the lid . ( UNDER BREATH ) Where 'd you go ? You need to punch in 0065 on the key code pad on the right and lift the inner lid . Okay , it 's open . Now what ? What does the monitor say ? " Fuel cell depleted . " You should see two purple tubes on the left . Is one of them out ? Yeah , and so is one of those things in the middle . All right . There 's a fuel cell panel on your upper left . I need you to hit the fourth button to open it . Okay . All right . Look inside , you should se a series of power cells . Yeah , I see them . Okay , listen , Sarah . Yeah . I need you to remove one of the cells from its base but try not to jostle it , it is fully charged . SARAH : Okay . Sarah , Sarah , are you all right ? ( WHIMPERING ) Sarah , Sarah , are you all right ? Got it . Good girl . Okay . Okay . I need you to take the replacement cell and spare cell and replace it with the dead one . Okay . And listen , Sarah . Yeah . Listen to me very carefully . Do it very slowly and do exactly what I say . Is that dangerous ? A discharge would mean a large electrical shock . Oh , my God ! No , listen , we can 't scare her now . SARAH : How do I do that ? Carefully . Okay . Carefully slide the cell into the slot with the metal tip away from you . ( THUNDERING ) Stop , don 't move ! Hold on ! ( GRUNTING ) r ? Who do you work fo ( RUMBLING ) Sarah ! DANIEL : Sarah ? Done . DANIEL : Okay , okay . SARAH : It 's in . All right . ? Are both the tubes glowing Yes . All right , lower the lid and back away . Let 's see what happens . The box . Is there another one ? No , that 's it . Sir . Honey . Good job . That 's it , right ? We can go home ? Yes . Thanks to you . Now , everyone , I apologize , but there is much work to be done . I have coordinates to be entered , and settings to be adjusted . So if you 'll please excuse me . So when are we going to do this ? Soon . Caleb , please tell me you have good news . It wasn 't there . Caleb . Yeah , I know , we 're running out of time and I 'm still dealing with the leak . They 're still after the device ? I don 't know who they 're working for , but they 're rogue agents . I 'm sure of it . What do I do about Quinn and Tesslor ? They keep askin for updates . . Keep stalling them , kid . I 'm going to the second bank Okay . e . We found something in the wreckage you 're going to want to se t ? Who the hell took that on the fligh Not sure , but it 's discharged . What about prints ? Tell you what , let me take it . I 'll run it back to the office for prints . I already sent them to Allison . Good . ? What the hell is going on up there ( PHONE BEEPING ) Quinn . The vortex is holding firm on its course for Los Angeles . Do we have an estimate on casualties ? It 's impossible to estimate , could be millions . Good God . There 's something else you should know , sir . I 've been running simulations on the vortex 's trajectory . I 'm sending you a visual now . Right now , it 's about a quarter-mile long . But as it continues to move across the state , the vortex will just keep growing . In a few hours , it will be the size of California . A few hours after that , the size of Asia . But there 's no reason to believe that this phenomenon will be isolated to this planet . Eventually , its size will merely expand to infinity . The entire universe will cease to exist . Everything ? Termination point . Do we have clearance at the next bank ? . It 's too close to the vortex The lines are down . The town is evacuated . Look , if you just let me talk to Quinn or Van Elden , maybe we can have a team meet you there . ( STATIC ) What 's this ? Those are the new coordinate for your controller . There will be a recovery tea ready to take possession of the teleporte r once we arrive . Who are you ? I 'm whoever my employer wants me to be . Right now , I am being paid a large sum of money . to acquire and deliver the Alpha String Project I 'm not giving you anything . e . And I 'm not giving you a choic Well , then we aren 't going anywhere . Are you forgetting what 's outside the window , Doctor ? You either put in those coordinates or we all die . If it means protecting the Alpha String Project , I 'm willing to make that sacrifice . Really ? And what about the people back there ? Are you willing to sacrifice them as well ? Let 's find out .

( DIALING TELEPHONE ) AUTOMATED VOICE : The numbe you have reached is not in service . Sir , there 's something I need to discuss with you . If it 's about Caleb , I kno the lines are down . It 's not just about Caleb , sir . I ran those prints from the gun found at the crash site . What did you find ? The prints were linked to a classified government personnel file . Classified ? So I broke into the system ... ? You broke into a classified government file Sir , it was justified . I found out the gun was registered to a David Martin . So I ran a quick scan of his dossier . His resume is filled with black ops , and special forces . I don 't think that this was just some random guy on the plane . I think he was there to steal the teleporter . He might also be linked to a possible leak at STC . Someone 's after the second control unit . You 're right about the leak . e . There 's a man on the insid but he 's under surveillanc Who ? It 's Quinn . Caleb has been investigating hi m for months . . Come with me But what about Caleb , sir ? He 'll be fine . We can 't talk here . Have you told anyone else about any of this ? No , sir . ( BRAKES SCREECHING ) Damn it ! Null-space looks beautiful this time of year , doesn 't it ? Hey . t ? What if he can 't fix i ? He 'll fix it . Yeah , but what if he can 't Then we fly into the vortex and we all die . ( SCRATCHING ) s ? Are you sure about thi e . They 're killers , Berman .

I 'm working as fast as I can You know , I got to ask you , t , if you don 't want this technology getting ou why not just destroy the damn thing ? g ? Why risk everything Do you have a child , Mr. Martin ? He 's probably forgotten he 's got a father , but yeah , I got a son . If you found out that your son had the potential to destroy humanity , would you kill him ? No , I don 't think I could . You would protect him , hide him , shape him into all that is good . Like what I have attempted to do . . Yeah , with a machine . You got to get out more , Doc That blonde one , she 's a real wildcat . MARTIN : Did you restra in the passengers ? . Yeah , yeah , they are not going to get loose this time Yeah , you said that last time , two people are dead . ( GASPS ) ( COCKING GUN ) ? How am I suppose d to react to that They 're innocuous . Remnants from our past from approximately two hours ago . The closer we get to the vortex , I suspect we 're traveling backwards in time . What ? I didn 't expect you to understand . ( WIND HOWLING ) Tesslor , what 's the latest ? We discovered that the teleporter signal is on the red side of the red / blue shift . In English . The signal is weakening . Because the plane in null-space is traveling backwards in time . With our new coordinates , it is possible the plane could jump out of null-space and erase this timeline . None of this will have happened . ( SHATTERING ) All right , I got the new controller . . Let 's put this theor y of yours to the test You will be opening up a wormhole directly onto the plane . Type in these numbers . 6-3-3 . Nasty out there , isn 't it ? That must be my controller . You 're behind this . I wouldn 't take all the credit . But I will admit , I was the first one to see a golden opportunity about to go to waste . Now , hand it over . . This isn 't your fight , Caleb Give me back the controller and I will save your family . Let the government take care of the rest . Give it to me , Caleb . You got about 30 seconds until this whole building is obliterated . Then I suggest you give it to me quickly . Caleb ! ( SCREAMS ) 22-36-22 . 23 ... Don 't test me , Doc , you know what happens . n . 22-36-22 , put it i Let me see it . Fine , what now ? It will take a few minutes to charge and then I 'll hit the final key . Liam , go check that out . They 're cuffed , don 't worry about it . Caleb ! Dad ? Oh , my God , how did you get here ? It 's a long story . I 'm looking for a gu y named Daniel Winter . Yeah , he 's up front with the others . How many ? Two . And they have guns . Cut the rest of them loose . Okay . Go check it out . Why don 't you go ? Yeah , I 'll check it out . Don 't shoot anybody . Drop it . No , no , no , honey . Caleb . . You stay with me . No , no , you stay with me You 're going to be okay . I 'm going to get you home , okay ? Honey .

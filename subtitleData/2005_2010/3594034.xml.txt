 Tyler ? Did you feel that ? Yeah , mom ? Yeah , you 're in big trouble . No , huge . - I 'm not kidding . - Yeah , I know . Good morning , Roy . Morning , father Jack . Foreclosures are on the rise , up another 6 % in the last month alone . And housing prices continue to fall ... economic stimulus package ... - Thanks for coming in so early . - It 's a pleasure . It 's the only time . I could make it down here . Don 't even mention it . All right . I 'm a little excited . You got the ring ? Of course I got the ring . - She is gonna like this , isn 't she ? - She 's gonna love it . I was gonna do the whole get down , on one knee thing , that 's not too corny , is it ? The knee is a classic . You can 't go wrong with the knee . - Knee it is . - Good . - What was that ? - I don 't know . - Good morning , Haley . - Hey , good morning . - Here . - Thank you . - You pitched Franny my idea ? - He loved it . That was a great take on the vice-president . Let me guess . He wants Martinez to do it . They love you ... And all . It 's cool . I get it . Shut up , Chad , and read the news . How exactly did you get into a fight ? Crashing a party in Soho . So you snuck out in the middle of the night to go to a party ? Well , it was Brandon 's dumb-ass idea . Who 's a dumb-ass ? Where are you ? Some clinic off of Bloomfield . - I 'm coming to get you . - I 'll just take my bike home . It 's ... What 's going on ? ! What is this ? ! Mom , what is ts ? ! Roy ! Look out ! It 's coming down ! Call the paramedics ! Mom ? Mom ? ! Tyler ? Stay where you are . - Tyler , are you somewhere safe ? - Mom ? Mom ! Mom ! Tyler ! Stay where you are ! I 'm coming for you ! Tyler ! Mom ! Something 's wrong , man . I gotta go . I 'm not going anywhere . Oh , my god ! Idiot ! Let 's go , kid ! Let 's move it ! Come on ! - It 's the only way I can get home ! - Let 's move ! - I mean , all the streets . Let 's move ! - What about my bike ? ! No more ! Let 's go ! Move out , people ! Move ! - Let 's go ! - What is that ? There 's been no contact with any of the 29 ships now hovering over the major cities of the world . Come on , Ryan , pick up . Streets are jammed . People are trying to flee ... The sheer mass of the ships moving through New York and L.A. Was enough to rock both cities for miles ... N.O.R.A.D. Is now confirming the first jet to encounter the spacecraft experienced full electrical failure . Dude , this is " Independence Day " ! Which was a rip-off of any number of alien invasion predecessors . Thank god ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . Good . Thank god ! - I need to get through . - Nobody is getting through . { \ pos ( 192,50 ) } - Look again , I 'm FBI . - Counterterrorism division . I can read . - You 're still not getting past . - I 'm looking for my son . My son is in there . If you will let me in there , I can find him . Not gonna tell you again . Turn around . Nobody is getting through . Turn around . Please ! He called me an hour ago . He 's in there ! Come on , now ! - Mom ? - Tyler ! Mom ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . Oh , god ! Oh , god ! Oh , my god . - = 101 = - " PILOT " VO : ¤ Aka ¤ kaiser66 Don 't be frightened . We mean no harm . Please accept our apologies . We 're truly anguished by the turmoil our arrival has caused . This is a momentous day . Until , we believed we were the only intelligent life in the universe . We 're overjoyed to find that we 're not alone . My name is Anna , and I am the leader of my people . We 're delighted to meet you , but we need your help . We 're far from home . After we 've replenished ourselves and shared with you what we can , we will leave you , hopefully better than we found you . We look forward to getting to know our new friends . There will be more communication with your world leaders in the hours to come . Until then , we are of peace always . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } " We 're all god 's Creatures " ? That 's how the Vatican explains the existence of Aliens ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - They decided that in a day ? - Yes . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Rattlesnakes are god 's creatures , too . Doesn 't mean they good for us . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } - Have faith in our leaders , Jack . - I do , father . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } It 's just that there 's not a lot of scripture on the subject . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Meaning ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I 'm at a loss to explain how god and Aliens exist the same world . Aren 't you ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } What do you want to do , Jack ? Call the Vatican and question their position ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } No , I just ... { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I don 't know what to do . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } All we can do is pray and minster to our congregation . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Our congregation amounts to two bag ladies , a heroin addict and Roy . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } That may be , father landry , but we will minister to any size ... { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Congregation . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } And it appears there 's some kind of translation ... - Look at that . It 's opening up . - Dude ... that is so cool ! I was right there , man . I was right underneath that thing . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } They 're calling themselves " The Visitors . " { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } You say that like it bothers you . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Visitors are old friends who drop by for a drink . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Did you see that we got a com alert today ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } No , I was a little busy looking at the space ships outside my window . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } You 're looking at terrorist alerts ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Chatter among terrorist cells world wide dropped like rock when the V showed up . Except for one of the cells we 've been tracking . Their chatter ... instead of falling off , it actually spiked . So what , you think there 's a connection between the two ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } We intercepted an uncoded message from them as of yesterday . They 're suddenly looking to acquire large amounts of C-4 . Why do that unless you 're going after a target ? Like say us while we 're distracted ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } I 'll run the databases . I 'll put together a profile on them . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Thank you . You watching ? { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Yeah , I 'm watching . Anna and her entourage will be escorted into the building where she ... Hey , how are you with all of this ? Are you and Tyler okay ? - We 're fine . - Did you hear from the ex ? He left a message . He wanted us to know he 's okay . I 'm not bitter . It 's fine . I feel good , happy . You know that I 'm here for you , anything you need . Look , we 'll hit the ground running tomorrow .

Mom , it 's starting . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } Here is Anna . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } She is now approaching the mike for a statement . Let 's listen in . - Damn , she 's hot . - I know , right ? !

We are honored by your friendship . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } We will cherish it , { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } nurture it and never abandon it . We are of peace always . Anna , how long have you been ... What do you have to say about the damage caused by your arrival ? The similarities between visitors and humans ? Our scientists say it 's impossible . - Our scientists can explain it . - That 's not an answer . - Why don 't you explain it ? - Why don 't you show some respect ? Do you have a question ? Yeah . I have a question . Is there such a thing as an ugly Visitor ? I don 't understand . You all seem to be what we consider attractive . Thank you . You 're not so bad yourself . No , I 'm sorry . No one allowed past this point . - Come back here ! Anna ! - No one 's allowed past this point . It was a truly remarkable moment . In the midst of all the chaos and , yes , even hostility from some , came something unexpected from our new friends ... a sense of humor . Should the press be so tough on the v 's ? They did just get here , after all . When we come back , I 'll be joined by a panel of media experts to discuss that and much , much more . Stay with us . We 'll be right back . I want him . It 's been three weeks since the visitors ' arrival , yet thousands are still flocking to see the mother ships in person . As a result , host cities find themselves in the midst of a mini economic boom ... tourism , spending on V merchandise ... all a welcome shot in the arm to local economies . The newly opened visitor healing centers are drawing huge crowds . People afflicted with one of the 65 ailments the v 's can cure are jamming the centers , hoping for their own personal miracle . And government officials have begun talks to open visitor embassies . But not everyone likes the idea . Violent protests denouncing the v 's have broken out in numerous host cities . And more demonstrations are planned in the days to come . More on this ... We finally got a real lead on our cell . Our cell ? - I 've heard that one before . - No , this is a good one . That 's my coffee . A truck suspected of hauling drugs was impounded by NYPD last night . They searched for residue , no drugs . But they did find traces of ... C-4 . See this ? The truck came from here on long island . Nice ! - Field trip ? - Can I drive ? No . Silos are empty . We 're still searching the grounds , but I gotta tell you , e . , this feels like ather dead end . What 's this , 20 leads we found on this cell so far ? Every one of them 's fallen through . What ? Look at the sat photo . - Yeah ? - That 's our truck . What is a white truck doing parked in front of that shack ? Nothin ' . I think we can rule out suicide . C-4 . Yeah , this is Ryan . I need your help . - How 'd you get this number ? - They 're here . It 's starting . - Ready for lunch ? - Yeah . I 'm hungry . What if that was important ? Sweetheart , there is nothing more important than you . How 'd you get tickets ? Dude , I can 't believe we 're about to see the inside of a freakin ' spaceship . You rock . Holy ! This is awesome . Dude ! This is incredible , man ! It 's like an amusement park . ... to the main docking station will only take about two minutes , so hang on tight and enjoy the ride . - Unbelievable , man . - My ... Step this way , please , and welcome . Hello . Welcome to the new york mother ship . My name is Lisa . The examiner says the body 's been dead less than a day , but he was tortured before he was killed . They 've been printing fake docs passports , I.D.s. Best fakes I 've ever seen . It 's a major operation , but no one was here . They cleared out like they knew we were coming . We 'll get the prints off the victim , see if we can get his I.D. Our ability to manipulate gravity is essential for long-term space travel . Dude , dude , check it out . Dude . That V girl 's coming over here . Be cool . Having a good time ? Having a great time . Good . Have you heard about our new peace ambassador program ? Peace ambassador program ? Yeah . You sign up , hang out with V 's , learn about our culture , and you act as V ambassadors to your own communities . You even get a uniform . It sucks . You have to be 18 years old to join . We 're only 17 . You can still join . You just need your parent 's signature . Yeah . Well , that 's , kind of a tough sell right now . Our parents don 't even know we 're here . It 's too bad . I just got assigned to the New York chapter . We could 've spent some time together . We 're all so quick to jump on the bandwagon . And a ride on the bandwagon , it 's ... it sounds like fun . But before we get on , let us at least make sure it is sturdy ... and sound . Let us at least examine it to really make sure it is something that we want to climb aboard . No one is saying , " don 't trust the visitors . " Don 't they need to earn our trust ? It 's something we all need to think about . I thought we were clear about this , Jack . People need to hear the V 's are part of god 's plan . - They hear it from you , father . - They need to hear it from you , too . I thank god for the visitors every day , Jack . This church stood empty for years . Now look at it . The visitors are not driving people away from god . They 're driving people back to god . People are scared , father . That 's why they come . But they come , and that 's the blessing in disguise . It bothers me that they showed up right when we needed them the most . The world 's in bad shape . Who wouldn 't welcome a savior right now ? I agree they 're a godsend , and we should be grateful . But that 's the danger . Under the right conditions and with enough time , gratitude can morph into worship ... or worse , devotion . I thought you priest types would like to see somethin ' . They healed me . I got no pain . My god , Roy . It 's amazing . Yeah . Ty . Come here for a second . Your principal sent me this link to this ... Awesome video . - What are you doing on my account ? - Check it out . More , more , more ! Come on ! V 's rule ! Come on ! Hurry up . There 's gonna be people coming . V 's rule , man ! First and foremost , the fact that you 're tagging now ... So proud . I called Brandon 's folks to kind of , you know , spread the joy . They weren 't surprised . They said that you two are obsessed with the V 's . I 'm not obsessed . Really ? Because this looks very obsessive to me . Texts , instant messages . And here 's an entire page about how to spread their word through tagging . Those aren 't even my links . Brandon sent them to me . Well , that 's okay then . Brandon sent them to you . So you 're gonna do whatever Brandon or the V 's or whoever tells you to do ? - You have to think for yourself . - I do think for myself ! Tagging someone 's property because a web site tell you to - Is thinking fourself ? - You call it tagging . But you know what ? The V 's ... they call it spreading hope . You have to talk to me . What going on with you ? Is it because of your dad ? Is it because he left ? You 're blaming him ? At least he has an excuse to be out of touch with his kid . He left me . I did not leave . I am here for you . When you 're here . There he is the man of the hour . Hello Mr. Decker . Hello . - What 's going on , Freddy ? - You 've been selected . For ? Anna would like to do a live broadcast from the ship . And intimate one-on-one to help ease the protests against us . She 'd like you to do the interview . I got it . Who was that ? It 's no one . - No one ? - Yes . No one . You 've been getting a lot of calls from " no one . " It 's nothing . Okay ? We don 't do this , you and me ... Keep secrets . Talk to me . What 's going on ? What 's going on ? Sweetheart ... Just ... Don 't read things into things , okay ? It was no one . Really . So pretty . - I forgot my spoon . - Yeah . Can I get an extra spoon ? - Okay . - Thank you , sir . What do you know ? Another fake one . Others like this . Solve the case yet , Sherlock ? Not one name , not one photo , not anything from these passports matches any on our system . How can you not find this guy ? He 's very creepy . If only " creepy " were a biometric parameter in our facial recognition software . You 're kind of sexy when you talk all computer-y . - I am ? - Absolutely . What 's this ? Progress . I I.D.Ed our victim from the silo . His name is Owen Chapman . This is a search warrant for his house . All right . - Clear . - Yeah , I 'll check ... They knew we were coming again . Someone tipped them off . Who are you calling ? Owen . Owen our victim Owen ? Text . " To : all attending tonight . " Location : 400 Pier avenue , Brooklyn , 10 : 00 p.m. Pass code . " If you 're new , be prepared for the test . Any info you can share about this cell is important . " Owen was going to a meeting about a sleeper cell ? If you have info about a sleeper cell , you call the cops . You don 't go to a meeting . Ryan . - Stay away from me , Georgie . - Ryan , please . I told you I 'm not that guy anymore , stop calling me . We need your help . - " We " ? Who 's " we " ? - There 's about 25 of us . We 've only met a couple times but we 're still recruiting . You 're trying that again after all those people got killed the last time ? We 're being a lot more careful this time . - Please , you gotta help us . - I 'm about to get engaged , okay ? I 'm not gonna put my fiancée at risk . If I get involved , it puts her at risk , And I 'm not gonna let that happen . So you 're just gonna sit there on the sidelines ? - You know how many lives are at stake ? - She doesn 't know about my past . I 'd like to keep it that way . That 's where we 're meeting if you change your mind ... or grow a conscience . I liked your sermon the other day . You 're right to question the V 's . Are you all right ? I know the real reason they 're here , father , and I am not the only one . - The real reason ? - The V 's are gonna obliterate us You 're bleeding ! I was coming to see you . The V 's did this to me . - Let me get you some help . - No , no , no . Take this and go to this address and give it to the people there . All right , all the information 's inside . - Promise me . - Okay . Please , it 's important . Okay , okay . I 'm gonna get you some help . I 'll be right back . Thanks again for choosing me to do this . I 'm really excited . So are we . Do you have any questions before we go to air ? No . Just be sure not to ask anything that would paint us in a negative light . Excuse me ? Don 't ask any questions that would portray us negatively . Ask ones like you did when we first met . I think there 's a mistake . I 'm a journalist . It 's my job to ask questions even if they make the other person uncomfortable . - That was not my understanding . - Standing by to go to air . Afraid I don 't have a choice . This interview is now canceled . Hang on . Hang on . Look , this is just how it 's done . I swear I 'll be fair . You 'll need to be more than fair if you want to proceed . - Two minutes to air . - We can 't be seen in a negative light . This interview would elevate your career , wouldn 't it , Mr. Decker ? Don 't you want to elevate your career ? You don 't even know what this meeting is , and you 're just gonna go in like you 're invited . They 're expecting people they haven 't met before , so , yeah . This is stupid . Why don 't we call for backup ? You know why . Because you think there 's a mole tipping off our cell . It 's a closed loop if it 's just you and me . Then I 'm coming in with you . It 's a bad idea . I need you to watch the perimeter . I will be back in 30 minutes . If I 'm not , you can call in the cavalry . I 'm here for the meeting . This is a word-of-mouth group . You 're here because someone we trust personally referred you . This is how we do things . This woman is a doctor . She 'll be injecting a small dose of anesthetic into each of you . Anesthetic for what ... exactly ? Good evening and welcome . Tonight , " prime focus with chad decker " is proud to present an up close and personal interview with Anna , the visitor high commander . On behalf of all of us , I wanna thank you For this opportunity to get to know you a little better . Thank you , Chad , and please , feel free to ask anything and everything . I 'm here to discuss all topics without reserve . I want you to confirm that you see skull bone . Take a good look at it . It 's important . You 're next . What is life like where you come from ? We come from a place of great beauty , vast cities , massive oceans . Much like Earth . Though unlike you , we don 't divide ourselves into countries . We 're one united people . - You 've all passed the test . - Test for what ? To ensure that you 're not a visitor . In order to walk among us , they disguise their appearance by cloning human flesh over their own reptilian skin . I thought everyone here was up to speed . The visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . You 've said we 're the only other intelligent life you 've encountered in your travels . Yes . Humanity is a rare gift , one we hold in the highest regard . For decades , they 've been implementing a plan that will result in the extermination of every man , woman and child on the face of this Earth . We 're honored and privileged to be able to assist mankind with our knowledge and technology . Truth be told , it stirs great emotion in us . So you are emotional beings ? We are , but we 've evolved to quickly process and expel all negative feelings . Happiness , we 've learned , comes from tranquility and peace . V 's posing as humans established themselves in all facets of life , whether it be business , government , religion , the military . It took years . And once embedded among us , they set out to cause worldwide instability ... unnecessary wars , economic meltdown , faith twisted into extremism . If you could speak to the protesters , what would you say ? That embracing change is never easy , but the reward for doing so can be far greater than anything you can imagine . Tonight we 're announcing the expansion of our healing centers . The goal is to open one in every major city across the world . The final stage of the visitors ' plan began with them revealing themselves to us . They gain trust with the promise of friendship and technology . And , of course , all they 're really doing is positioning themselves as the saviors of mankind . The intent goes beyond just healing . We want to provide complete medical services to all . You 're talking about ... universal health care ? I believe that 's what you call it , yes . By the time people figure this out , it 'll be too late . They 'll take over unless we can stop ' em . I see the looks . It 's the first time hearing this for some of you . You think we 're crazy . Right ? Do you have any proof ? You know , other than scary stories being passed around the internet . Who are you ? Who referred you ? It doesn 't matter . I 'm leaving . Wait , wait . I have proof ... I think . It 's a bunch of photos ... supposedly visitors living on earth . - This guy is a visitor ? - Yeah . This guy is a terrorist . He 's part of a sleeper cell . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . A sleeper cell of visitors . Yeah , a sleeper cell of visitors . You did a brave thing coming here tonight . Well , if I 'm so brave , why am I scared to death ? I think that makes you human . I 'm Erica . Get down ! What the hell , Dale ? ! Let 's go ! Where the hell did they come from ? - We were so careful this time . - Georgie ... No . You were right to walk away . What hope do we have ? - There is hope . - But they are animals ! Not all of them . I was wrong to walk away from this , Georgie . You were right to fight . There 's others out there like me , other traitors , deserters . We 'll help . Ryan . Where you going ? I gotta go tell val i 'm leaving . It 's not safe for her to be around me anymore . Mr. Decker ? Mr. Decker , may I have a word with you , please ? Anna loved you . I 'm sure she did . She wants you to know we intend to call on you again . She trusts you . I 'm not so sure I trust her . Look , I 'm sorry for the misunderstanding tonight , but you did the right thing . Compromising one 's principles for the greater good is not a shameful act . It 's a noble one . Really ? I find that hard to believe . Your people are easily threatened . What you did tonight went a long way toward reassuring them . What 's the harm ? She backed me into a corner . She could 've chosen anyone to interview her . She chose you . We would like to continue with the arrangement . Whenever anna has something significant to say , we would like her to say it through you . Unless you have an aversion to a worldwide audience hanging on your every word . Val ? I hate myself . You just ... you kept getting these call from " no one , " and ... I thought there was somebody else . I looked around and I found this . You were gonna ask me to marry you . I was even gonna get down on one knee . Do you still love me ? More than you 'll ever know . I don 't know who to trust anymore . I can 't get the image of Dale just lying there out of my head . What do we do now ? We help build a resistance . We recruit ... bring more into the fold . We have to be careful . We 'll be careful , but we have to fight . We 'll fight . They have a big head start . They 're arming themselves with the most ... powerful weapon out there . Yeah ? What 's that ? Erica , what big weapon ? Devotion . To the dawn of a new day . We are of peace always .

 Previously on " Defying Gravity " ... What are you doing ? You try to find the problem , and I 'll try to find your sex drive . Do you have any ... I 've had a vasectomy . According to your chart you did , but not according to your scan . Thank God I 'm not pregnant . Oh , no , no . You are pregnant . Means you 're just not gonna have a baby . Look , I know of a guy . He 's a doctor . Check ... Donner ? Check . Do you copy ? Donner ? Launch now , Donner ! Sharon ... Donner , my man , this had better be a joke . Talk to me . Donner , do you copy ? Sharon ? It knows . Beta knows . We need you to visit pod 4 , honey . When were you gonna tell everybody else ? 43 days ... when you get to Venus . ± ¾ × öä " ½ ö ¹ © ñ § ï ° ½ " á ÷ £ ¬ ñï ½ ûóãóúéìòµóãí ¾ - = Ææàãðü × öä " × é = - Ê ± ¼ äöá : ¿ ´ äãàë × ùîþ ¹ ý P.N.R ... Point of no return . It sounds simple . You step across the line , and you focus only on the way ahead . No going back . Sounds like a good way to live life ... look only ahead ... Put the bad stuff behind you and move on . But that 's impossible . Your past always finds you ... Donner ? Even when you think you 've let it go . Everything okay ? Yeah . During the days of the Roman republic , crossing the Rubicon river with an army was considered an act of war . In 49 b.C. , Julius Caesar ignored that law . He made the choice to cross the river , leading to civil war , the end of the republic and his own deification . I 'd say Caesar won . Thank you , Nadia . Gracias . Once we pass our own rubicon point , we 'll no longer be able to do a direct abort and return quickly to Earth . This is our last chance to take a shortcut home instead of having to go all the way around Venus , and we 're pretty far away from home right now ... Almost 30 million kilometers . Do you see Earth way out to the left at about 11 : 00 ? Very soon it will look like just another star in the night sky . I really think we should tell them about beta now . I know this group . They need some time to process . There are larger issues at play here . This call 's not up to you . It 's not even up to me . But I don 't want to lie to them . This isn 't about what any of us want . This is about what we have to do . Ted . Roger that . Good night . Donner and Nadia , we need a nominal for every system before we can pass rubicon tonight at 1900 . About 30 systems are coming up as off-nominal . Probably just needs a reboot , but you get to check it anyway . Lucky us . And we will be assembling a time capsule . You gotta be kidding me . Time capsule ? On our last mission to Mars , at Rubicon , Goss had each of us pick an object ... something personal . And we put them all in a time capsule , and we left it behind . We have to leave something ? I just don 't think I have anything I can get rid of . Just put a pair of your undies in , Morales . That is not funny . Well , it 's a little funny . It 's just that everything I have is important to me . It 's supposed to be important , Morales . That 's why you 're leaving it behind . You know , Mars mission 's not exactly a time in my life I 'm looking to relive . Well , this time capsule isn 't about Mars , Donner . It 's about unity . It 's about mutual sacrifice . Anything that brings us closer will make it easier to deal with challenges down the line . Okay , and you believe that ? Yes , I do . Well , I didn 't bring anything to put in it . Oh , yes , you did . This is Rufus . Okay . What 's a Rufus ? It 's our space baby ... or at least , he will be . Right now it 's a 21-day-old rabbit embryo . Rufus , say hello to your dad . Jen , what are you doing ? You know you 're not supposed to keep those embryos past a couple of days . It 's just with this one . Jen , you cannot have a full-grown rabbit on the ship . You know you 're just gonna have to kill it ... I know . I know . I ... I just ... I wanted to keep one for a little while . I mean , aren 't you a little bit happy ? Babies are supposed to make everyone happy . It 's a 21-day-old rabbit embryo . It 's not a baby . Uh , okay . You know what ? Um , I never showed him to you . Jen . No , it 's fine . It 's fine . I 'm fine . I just ... forget I even brought it up . Bye , babe . Storage bay 7 pressurization system ? Rebooting . Pressurization system is now nominal . Everything should be that easy . Uh , accelerometer assembly system ? Nominal . Microwave scan beam ? Nominal . Okay . Uh , how about I take the ones over here and you take the ones over there ? The brayton turbines ? Why is this a problem for you ? The brayton turbines ? Before we left , things were good . I think they 're still good . I think we 're gonna be a go . Not this . This . I liked being friends with benefits . Why are things different up here than they were down there ? Because they just are . Is this about Zoe ? No . No . Because it was about Zoe last time . This has nothing to do with Zoe . Look , we 're not training anymore . I don 't want to complicate this mission . This mission ? This is about Sharon . It was ten years ago , Donner . Let it go . Is it weird for you ? A lot of things are weird for me . What 'd you have in mind ? Goss ranking everyone who might get to go on the mission ... A.S.C.A.N.s and instructors . You nervous ? I don 't get nervous . Mm . Confident . I like that . How about a wager ? I 'm ranked higher than you , you sleep with me . If you are ranked higher than me , I 'll sleep with you . Uh , I don 't date astronauts . Mm , you should reconsider . Yeah ? I have a lot to offer . Like what ? One ... no emotional attachment . Two ... no expectations . I don 't care if we have a future . I don 't care if you call me the next day . And I really don 't care if you ever buy me dinner . But I like dinner . There it is . Don 't get too comfortable being on top , Schilling . I love being on top . Looks like I win . I vote my place . You can make it up . You 'll do better . Damn it . I 'm not top eight . 28th ? Seriously ? 28th ? Four better than me . Dead last . Give me the belt . Yeah . Way to go , bud . Thanks . Well , hey . You know what ? Don 't worry about it . It 's only the first one , right ? It 'll get better . And you have that thing to deal with . You know , the thing , the , um ... extenuating circumstances . 28th is not extenuating circumstances . 28th is , um ... 28th is I 'm gonna end up teaching high school geology . 12th and 13th ? It 's Goss . I stood on Mars . Excuse me ? I 'm just putting that out there , among colleagues , that I 've stood on Mars . I know . I was there . No , no , no . Let 's be clear . I was on Mars . He was on Mars . You were safe up on " Zeus " issuing commands . That 's ' cause I was the commander of the ship . You seriously expect me to believe that I 'm 12th ? I might have tolerated second because Ted Shaw is a hell of an astronaut , but 12th ? Donner , it 's just a preliminary ... I 've stood on Mars . You 're handicapping us because of something that happened five years ago that we were all responsible for . You 're right . I 'm what ? You 're right . I am handicapping you two . I don 't want you guys on this mission . In fact , I don 't want you anywhere near my ship . You got baggage , Donner . Baggage kills people . No . Thinking you 're infallible kills people that didn 't have to die . I knew exactly what I was doing , and I can live with that . Can you really ? Yeah , I can . Come on , dude . It 's not worth it . You got something else , Donner ? Come on . You have the 10-minute rule in Germany ? It 's awesome . If Donner isn 't here in two more minutes , we all get to leave . Okay ... Oh , come on . Today we 're gotta be looking at " Antares " flight system . Except some idiot has posted the schematic for the lab module . All right . Um , it 's gonna be a general overview today . Those of you who don 't wash out will have the privilege of learning all about it later . Wrong . That 's wrong . That 's wrong . Wrong . No . Damn it . I 've just never done anything illegal , like ever . I follow rules . I am ... I 'm a rule follower . Well , uh , don 't worry . The market for keeping these things under wraps is pretty big . Tell me about the risks with the pill . Give me odds . Well , in clinical trials in Europe , one in a thousand women have difficulties . Those are pretty good odds . So that 's what I recommend to you . I , uh , I 'm not sure what I wanna do yet . Well , I understand . It 's a difficult decision . So I 'll leave you my card . If you decide that you want to move forward , then you give me a call . All right . Okay . Good luck . Your father has left me . What ? Your father has left me . Dad has not left you . I should have seen this coming . Mercury was in retrograde when we got married . Mom , I don 't have time for the crazy thing you do every time dad goes on a dig , all right ? I 'm in the middle of training . Oh , it 's not just a dig . He left for good . See ? Here 's the note . Do you have anything to drink ? And since when did you start eating ice cream ? I 've always eaten ice cream . Not by the bucket and only when you have the flu . You don 't have the flu , do you ? Maybe you could sneeze on your note-leaving father . Dad always leaves a note , he doesn 't believe in saying goodbye , and you are overreacting , like you always do . I 'm overreacting , because this time there 's someone else . Oh , there 's someone else . A field assistant not much older than you are . What are you gonna do ? I have no idea . Moving on to water filtration system . How we doing ? Off-nominal . Really ? It didn 't clear on reboot . Let me see that . Huh . How long till rubicon ? 4 hours , 17 minutes . Okay . Keep going . Any idea what 's going on ? Oh , it could be anything . The first four panels are nominal . If we can find it , it should be easy to fix . Rubicon 's in four hours . Roger that . All 's green and nominal . I 'll start down here . You okay ? You 're being quiet . You 're never quiet . Rollie and I kinda had a fight this morning . What ? You and Rollie never fight . It 's just ... his longest mission was 34 days , and I 'm facing six years , and he 's judging me . For what ? Nothing . It was nothing . It 's ... 'Cause he doesn 't understand what it 's like to be alone up here . You know , he doesn 't get it . 'Decline' I just want to see where you spend your time . Is that so bad ? I won 't even say I 'm your mother . You can introduce me as Bev Kennedy . It 'll be fun , like we 're friends . In fact , do that . Maybe I can meet a hot astronaut . Hi . I 'm Bev Kennedy , Zoe 's friend . Two gin martinis ... very dry , three olives . You got it . And before you start , I don 't want to talk about your father or his stupid field assistant . I want to focus on you . Oh , let me do a reading . You just carry them around with you now ? Yeah . Mom , could you please put those away ? People I work with ... they come in here . Well , it 's not like you ever tell me anything about your life . How else am I gonna know if you 're dating anyone ? I 'm not dating anyone . Well , why not ? You 're a lovely girl when you put makeup on . Nice cards . My mother was raised by gypsies . She used to be fun . All they 'll tell you is that I am 28th in the program , never gonna make the ship , and I should clearly just quit and get a research grant at some state university . Oh , don 't be ridiculous . At least go for an Ivy league school . Do you even listen when I talk ? Why are you here ? To have a drink with my daughter . No , no , no . Why are you here here ? I just wanted ... Wanted to wreak havoc in my life like you always do when dad leaves . Seriously , Bev , it 's enough . Ohh . The falling tower . Ohh . I 'm leaving . You 're making me dinner ? Hmm . Yes , I am . Hi . Hey , brother . So have you thought about when you 're coming over ? I have not . Oh , you lie . Okay . I 've thought about it a couple times . And ? Well , tempting as it might be , you 're still an astronaut . I don 't date astronauts . Technically , you don 't date astronauts anymore . Technically , that 's true . Technically , my top lock sticks , so you kind of have to Jimmy the door a little and then pull ... Hard . Lee , do we have access to the I.S.O. archives ? We have unrestricted access to pretty much everything . Listen , I want the Mars mission ... cockpit recordings , telemetrics , the works . Copy . " Calliope , " this is " Zeus . " We 're showing that the dust is breaching your thruster controls . The storm 's on the rise . We 're losing your launch window . Copy that , " Zeus . " Yeah , it 's looking bad down here . How far out are they ? 100 meters . We 're holding . The real feed never went to pixel . It was edited . The official statement says the transmission was cut off because of the storm . Well , obviously not . Turn up the volume on " b . " Just give ' em two minutes , mike . You don 't have two minutes . Well , we 're gonna take our chances . Not on my watch . You will die . The mission will fail . I need that lander off the planet now , Donner . Sharon ... Open the damn valve . Donner , launch . Sharon . Launch now . They could have made it . Sharon . Open the damn valve , Donner ! Launch now . Oh , forgive me . Who signed off on the editing and the press release ? Goss ? Yeah , it was Goss and someone else . We 've got 2 clearances here . The second one 's e-7 . What 's e-7 ? The national security council . Everything okay ? Think we missed something ? Apparently not . Listen . Hypothetically , if somebody were to tell you that they 're having , uh , I don 't know , hallucinations or something , what do you do ? Hallucinations ? Yeah . Well , hypothetically , I 'd have to report them to mission control and recommend they have a serious psych evaluation and bar them from any E.V.A. activity or landings . Okay . Good to know . Oh , that is classic . Excuse me ? Well , is that really all you have ? A bunch of religious crap ? Send it all into space . I wouldn 't expect you to understand . Well , I don 't know , Morales . I 'm just saying , your faith must be wavering if you need all that crap to prove it . Hey . Hi . You know , I ... I was just thinking that , um , we never actually got to talk about your paper , so wanted to let you know that the offer is still open , if you 're interested . Drink ? Cyanobacteria ? Come on . Tell me you 're at least a little tempted . It 's just ... I ... I can 't . Okay . Can I ask why ? Well , it 's just that by " drink , " I think you kind of mean " date , " and I kind of am seeing Ted now , and it 's just ... Ted 's a friend . When I say " drink , " I ... I really meant drink . Look , if I were ever to ask you out on a date , you would know . I 'm such an ass . I 'm so sorry , Rol . No . No , no , no , no . It 's all right . Maybe that didn 't come out right . You know what ? Let 's ... let 's just start this again . I 'd like to ask you some questions about your paper On cyanobacteria . Can I buy you a drink ? Well , it just so happens , those are two of my favorite things . I 'll take a draft , Tommy . You 're Maddux Donner . Yes , I am . You left two people on Mars . That 's the one . My daughter 's in the space program . She 's very smart . Zoe Barnes ... do you know her ? Yes , I do . Are you Zoe 's mom ? Bev Barnes . Nice to meet ya . The next drink 's on me . Nice to meet you . Zoe didn 't even tell me that she met you . That 's what every guy wants to hear . Well , don 't take it personally . She never tells me anything . I 'm sure it would have shown up in her cards , but she never indulges me . Would you like me to read you ? Sure , if it doesn 't involve money or pain . Excellent . Zoe 's thinking about leaving the program to look for a research grant at an ivy league school . Really ? Why ? I don 't know . Something about the number 28 and a ship . I think she 's being ridiculous . You got your question ? Yeah , go ahead . Cut . Ah , the lover . Well , you have at least one very important love affair in your life , possibly two . It 's not clear . She really said she 's leaving , huh ? Well , she said she 's considering it . The fool with the star . What 's that ? You 're a man haunted by your past . Not that that 's surprising , given your past . My cheating husband . Excuse me . No , it 's just ... I ... I 've always been so fascinated with marine life , you know ? And I see these pictures of what the great barrier reef looked like when it was still underwater . I can 't help but wonder ... wonder if " the effects of global warming " where directly responsible for the death of cyanobacteria and ultimately the death of the great barrier reef . " You really have read my paper . That 's impressive , sir . I also read your , um , follow-up , where you talk about the reintroduction of cyanobacteria into the rice paddies in Asia . Help promote the growth of rice and hopefully , uh , help alleviate the world food shortage . It 's very interesting . Okay , um , I 'm slightly terrified right now , but seriously , I mean , they 've been trying to put that into play for 50 years now . Yeah , well , I guess it 's just your dumb luck there 's someone else here who actually cares about what 's going on with the earth . We might be the only two . Well , then here 's to you and me , baby . Hey , babe . Hi . Ready for dinner ? Hey , my man . Hey , brother . How you doing ? Good . You good ? Yeah , really good . Thank you so much for the drink and the cyanobacteria . You 're welcome . Thoughts on cyanobacteria and the rice paddies in Asia ? Say nothing . I think she 's beautiful . Well , that 's not bad , but anyway , have a good night . You guys have a good dinner . Good night . Good night . Found this somewhere . Thank you . Actually , I was in the back of the class . I had to duck . Yeah , it got away from me . Sorry about that . Anger will do that , and frustration . Guilt . It 's not just a baseball , is it ? Mintz , don 't shrink me . I 'm just saying , if the story 's true , that 's a lot to carry around . What story is that ? Two astronauts are secretly dating . They go to a baseball game a couple nights before their Mars mission launch . He catches a home run ball and he gives it to her ... her prized possession . She takes it to Mars , and she doesn 't make it back . From that moment on , he can 't put that ball down . Maybe I got it wrong . Yeah , you did . Sharon caught the ball , bare-handed . Mrs. Lewis . Maddux . We agreed you wouldn 't come here again . I know we did . I 'm ... I 'm , uh , I 'm sorry . It won 't happen again . I have a confession to make . When we got back from Mars , I ... I took this from , uh , your daughter 's things before they had a chance to pack 'em up and send ' em to you . I didn 't have any right to do that . I 'm sorry . This belongs to you , and , uh , I think ... I think you oughta have it . What makes you think that I would want that , Maddux ? I don 't know . It w ... it was Sharon 's , and , um ... I know it meant something to her . Well , it means nothing to me . Good night , Mrs. Lewis . Where have you been ? Your father called . I 'm going to meet him on the dig . What about " someone else " ? What ? Mother . Okay , okay . I might have overreacted . You okay , Zoe ? You look a little lost . You sure you don 't want me to ... Okay . Okay ? Really ? Okay as in yes ? Don 't make me say it again . I might come to my senses . So you 're pregnant . The hanged man told you that ? No . Your boobs are huge , two tubs of rocky road , and you haven 't had anything to drink since I got here . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know . This one is nominal , too . They 're all good . Well , that makes no sense . All right , let 's check ' em again . Has it occurred to you that everything 's gone wrong with this mission ? Wrenches , filtration systems . " Antares " was in orbit for a year of testing before we left . Maybe it 's us . Yeah , well , maybe it is . I was kidding . You know , Donner , we weren 't even supposed to be here dealing with this . We 're supposed to be on earth . You 're supposed to be irritating goss , and I 'm supposed to be reading " goodnight moon " to my son and ... and sleeping in bed with my wfe . Everything has gone wrong with this mission from the start . And maybe it 's time we said enough is enough . Are you saying you don 't want to do the check ? You just want to turn the thing around and go home ? No . Well , it kind of sounds to me like that 's what you 're saying . Ted , what 's going on ? Do you know something I don 't know ? No , not a thing . Let 's just check ' em again . What are you doing here ? What 's this I hear about you leaving ? What ? Well , Bev tells me that you 're thinking about leaving the program . Bev should not talk to strangers . I 'm not a stranger . Bev gave me a reading . She was actually kind of accurate . Perfect . How do you even think about leaving ? I don 't think I 'm gonna have much choice in the matter . You did see I was 28th . That 's like a preliminary ranking . That 's not anything . Yeah . You ever think about ... Living a different life ? What do you mean ? Like what ? Like a regular job and a family . Yeah . Yeah . Someday . I mean , right now , more than anything , I just want to fly . Don 't you ? Yeah . Don 't leave . Why ? You 're gonna be a good astronaut . Good night , Donner . All right , what now , engineer ? Humor me a second . It 's number five . The instrument panel says it 's clean . Run a sample check . This is definitely off-nominal . Donner , you 're reaching . Let 's just run the sample . Look at the PH . The sensor must be out . Probably ruined the carbon scrubs . We would have been screwed . Yeah . And you know there 's no way to judge PH by just looking at something . Well , it 's just lucky then , I guess . Message waiting . Message waiting . Mess ... Hey , Jenny . I guess you must be busy . I just wanted to say That I 'm ... I 'm sorry about this morning . And I don 't want to fight with you . No , I don 't get it . I just ... I just want to talk to you , let you explain it to me . In the meantime , um ... tell ... Rufus that daddy says hello and I wish I were there with both of you . * the tide is high * I 've never been so low * * you got room to grow * * you can never look up * * you can 't ever look down * * you get kicked around * * but I built it with sand * * and I built it with rock * * I built it with all of the things that I 'm not * * and I watch from the hill * * as it burns to the ground * * I can still see the smoke * * from my train out of town * * everything I build is breaking down * Rubicon in five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One . * scared of what I saw * * are you mad at all ? * Godspeed , " Antares . " Godspeed . * been a slammed door * It doesn 't even look like earth anymore . Mike , I need to talk to you . I got a board dinner . I 've seen the Mars recordings , both of them . My clearance actually exceeds the N.S.C. Well , if you 've seen both recordings , then you know I did my duty as commander . I 've seen the whole file , mike , including the telemetry . It shows that Lewis and Walker didn 't stop . And Donner and Shaw didn 't panic . You did . You 're out of line . We both know I 'm not . We both know that I had a damn good reason for wanting them off that planet . I want you off their backs , and whatever personal animosity you have towards them ... Let it go . Passing the point of no return doesn 't just happen . It 's a choice that we make , a line we decide to cross . * things that I 'm not * And then we live with the consequences . * ... ground * * I can still see the smoke * Eve , I don 't care what he says . There is no way he knew the ph was off in that tank . And he was talking about hallucinations earlier today . What did you tell him ? Nothing , which was the wrong thing to do , but I told him nothing . We 're all doing what 's necessary , Ted . Yeah , well , we 'll see what tomorrow brings . There are no promises of a positive outcome , no guarantees , that , like , Caesar , we 'll wind up with an empire . They feel a lot farther away today than they did yesterday . * are you mad at all ? * Don 't they ? * been an open book * * been a slammed door * All we can really count on is that things will change and that we 'll have to live with the results ... * trojan war * Hey , madman .

Do I look like goss to you ? It 's a different mission . Remember that . * from my train out of town * And that 's the hard part ...

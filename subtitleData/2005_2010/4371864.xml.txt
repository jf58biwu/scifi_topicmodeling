 To everything , there is a season , and a time to every purpose . The world needs to know about my findings , that 's all that 's important ! It is one thing to publish a book in the comfort of the university , it is another to leave everything behind , chasing a theory that is pure fantasy ! The earth spins at 1,000 miles an hour as we desperately try to keep from being thrown off . Like the first blush of winter that signals a great migration . You 're sweet . I 'm sweet ! Was there any warning of their arrival ? She has a name : Jessica . A sign , a single event that set this chain into motion ? - This is what you 've been waiting for . - Was it a whisper in God 's ear ? Be the one we need . Survive . Adapt . Escape . And if we could mark that single moment in time . That first hint of the prophecy of approaching danger ... I found a tape of a conversation my father had with a man named Sylar . Hello , Chandra , you made me this way . Would we have done anything differently ? Could it have been stopped ? You helped me to discover my potential . Or was the dye long ago cast ? And if we could go back , alter its course , stop it from happening ... - Would we ? - I can go back . Hiro . My name is Hiro Nakamura ! I 'm here to save your life ! Hey , Charlie ! Charlie , come on over here , and blow out the candles ! Hold that thought , okay ? I just gotta make a wish . Come on . - Hi . - Come on , honey ! P-Please , listen . Very important . Say ... " cheese . " Chapter Ten - Six Months Ago Can I help you ? I hope so , Mr. Gray . I can fix it . My watch isn 't broken . Actually , it is . Yeah , the self-winding coil is loose . - Your watch is running two seconds slow . How did you know ? Just a talent I have for the way things work ... - How the parts should go . - That looks rather complicated . That ... oh . The body 's standard , but the parts , the insides , are German . 1917 . I 've been working on it for seven years . How much do I owe you ? Oh , please . Don 't worry about it . You didn 't come here for the watch . I came to find you , Gabriel . My name is Chandra Suresh . I 'm a geneticist . I have a theory about human evolution . And I believe you ... are a part of it . Read it . If you 'd like to talk more , I 've written my phone number and address inside . License and registration . Oh , this isn 't my car , I kinda stole it . Can you take off the glasses for me , please ? I 'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car . No , I don 't feel like it . That wasn 't a suggestion . Well , here 's a suggestion . Why don 't you go get back in your car , and eat a dozen donuts . That is what you cops like to do , right ? I said step out of the car . Now . I think you really want to eat some donuts . Major developments ! Lori Trammel skanked her way through the entire football team ! - Who told you that ? - The entire football team . Anyway , somehow she found shame and resigned . Turned in her pom-poms ... I 'm in ? Are you kidding ? Claire , destiny is calling you . Come on , try it on . You can model , I 'll take pictures . We 'll totally commiserate the event . I think you mean " commemorate . " And ... I 'll try it on later . 'Kay , most girls can 't wait to get their uniforms on . I mean , except Lori Trammel . She couldn 't wait to take it off . Why do you have to be like that ? Okay , first of all , I 've earned that . And if you don 't want it or this , Kristy Chan is salivating for your position . - No ! I want it , I do . - Then show it ! Show me some S , P , I , R , I , T ! - I 'm not gonna drool ! - Then prove it , Claire ! Prove it ! Oh , my God . - What were you girls doing ? - Ugh , this is gonna need stitches . I 'm gonna take her to the emergency room . Jackie , honey , grab my purse . Let 's go . Come on , come on , honey . Hello . - Mr. Bennett ? - Yes . My name is Chandra Suresh . I need to speak to you about your daughter Claire . No , no . I-I teleport from future . - Do not go to work tomorrow . - Hmm ? Very , very ... It wasn 't raining yesterday . Hmm ? Mm , April showers . It 's been storming all week . April ? No , no , October . No , April 24th . It 's my birthday . Six months ? I 've got to get back . If I teleport again I could end up anywhere . Lunch for a T-Rex ! I 'M STUCK ! Birthday cake ? Happy Birthday . Hi , my name is Niki . And I 'm an alcoholic . Hi , Niki . - I 'm one year sober today . - Happy anniversary ! I work 60 hours a week . I stink of cigarettes . I got a kid so smart that he is flunking out of school . My husband can 't find a job because no one wants to hire an ex-con . There 's a leak in the roof . And I 'm feelin ' thirsty . Feels like too much for one person . So why are you here ? I don 't want another year to go by without you in my life , Nicole . Not being in your life was never my choice . - You kinda made that happen . - Look , I know how you feel about me . And Lord knows I deserve it . I was awful to you , and everyone I ever met . You weren 't awful , you just weren 't there . You can 't be awful if you 're not present . You know , I 'm married now . I heard . Look , Nicole ... I would love to meet him some time . I-I really want to get to know my grandson and my son-in-law . And you . Yeah , well , I don 't know if I 'm ready to get to know you . Hey . What 's going ... ? Ladies , 101 / 2 . Oh , you know , the reason I became a nurse was to wear shoes like this , - thank you very much . - Of course . - Get a drink ? - Yeah , it 's right inside . - I told him it wasn 't funny . - I know . - Hey , Mom . - Hello , sweetheart . - How are you ? Come on in . - I 'm good . Your father is very proud of you . - And still couldn 't make it . - Well , he had a meeting . Mr. Linderman 's in Atlantic City ... Listen , I-I did this without his blessing , and without his money . Okay ? So I think it 's only right that we celebrate without him . I have always wanted a nurse in the family . - We have enough lawyers . - Thanks , Mom . So , Peter , have you chosen a specialty ? Uh , I 'm thinking of hospice care . - Oh ! - Yeah . - Taking care of dead people ? - They 're not dead . They 're dying . And I think it 's noble . Thank you . - What 's the pay ? - Ugh . Honey . You know , I 'm gonna go call the sitter , and when I come back ... you are gonna dance with me . What 's going on ? The DA wants me to prosecute Linderman . - Dad 's biggest client . - Mm-hmm , yeah . Well , the DA thinks Linderman 's mob ties run so deep , if I can take him down , the empire crumbles . You do that , though , Dad 'll go down too . You used to tell him he was a criminal for protecting criminals . Here 's a chance to set things straight . - Take the stink off the family na ... - He 's still our father . No matter what he 's done . You go after him , you 're never going to forgive yourself . Ever . Come on , handsome . - Hold this for me , will you ? - Yep . May I ? So ... What ? You 're gonna cut me open ? I 'd like to run some tests . EEG , EKG , nothing invasive . - A friend at Columbia has access to an MRI . Mapping the brain . Measuring alpha waves , resting rates , neuron clusters . The brain controls every human action , voluntary or involuntary . Every breath , every heartbeat , every emotion . If the ... soul exists , scientifically speaking , it exists in the brain . When I was a kid ... I used to wish some stranger would come and tell me my family wasn 't really my family . They weren 't bad people , they were just ... insignificant . And I wanted to be different . Special . I wanted to change . A new name , a new life . The watchmaker 's son ... became a watchmaker . It is so futile . And I wanted to be ... important . You are important , Gabriel . What do you think my abilities might be ? Grand theft auto , larceny , robbery , arson , and suspected of murder in Oklahoma . That 's no way for a young lady to behave , now is it ? You need a goal , Hayden . A purpose . Let me go . Now ! You know ... With your ability , you can get anything you want . Created your own morality . There 's no person in the world that could say no to you . Now there is . Yamagato Industries . Ando Masahashi , please . Ando I need your help ... Sorry , Ando is sick . This is Hiro Nakamura . May I help you ? Great Scott . Matt . What are you doing ? What ? What are you doing sitting here ? Detective test is in an hour . Right . - Oh , you 're not chickening out , are you ? No ! No , man , of course not . All right , good , ' cause second time 's the charm for you , I can feel it . Just don 't go being a nervous wreck this time , okay ? What 's up with the donut ? - Uh ... - Dude , you 're like a walking clich√© . Yeah , well , you know what ? After today , I am gonna be a different man . Confidence ! I like that . Right ? Let 's go crush it . Hello , what 's up ? Hey . Oh , I don 't know what we 'd do without you , Hiro . - You have such an amazing attitude . - I have gift for you . - Happy Birthday . - Oh ... Mmm . A Japanese phrasebook . I love it . Oh , now we can understand each other better . Maybe you visit Japan . Very soon . Get out of Midland , far away . You are a kind and generous man . You speak Japanese very quickly . Lately , I 've just been able to remember everything . You have power , big memory . It will only get stronger in the future . The future . Right . I keep forgetting that 's where you come from . You don 't believe me ? I bend time and space . Oh , yeah , of course you do . Charlie , honey . Your order 's up . Hey ! - Where 'd these come from ? - Flower store , two blocks from here . Ha ha , funny . Oh . Oh , hang on , I have an order up . Already finished . Lynette ! You have got to see this ! Hiro 's a magician ! Oh , no , it 's not a trick . You don 't understand . I 'm trying to save your life . A very , very bad man is going to come here and ... Tomorrow , the swallow will slay the dragon . - Having a drink with your sister ? - Thinking about it . Used to be , couldn 't go an hour without missing Jessica . It 's important not to forget . Hal is back . He came to one of my meetings . He wants to meet you and Micah . He won 't meet anybody unless you want him to . He 's got money . He could ... he could help with tuition . We can get Micah into that private school . Now , you wanna have Hal over , let 's have him over for dinner . We can all say a prayer for Jessica . My brother Peter , the hospice nurse . Can you believe it ? It 's just ... Oh , it 's a perfect fit . - He 's selfless and empathic ... He 's self-centered and righteous . Self-righteous . - He 's a hell of a lot nicer than you . - He can afford to be . He hasn 't been under as much scrutiny . My dad did what he had to do to take care of his family , and that 's something that Peter is never gonna understand . And you do . It 's my responsibility . It 's my inherited ... birthright . I didn 't ask to be Dad 's favorite . I never asked to be loved more than Peter , but that 's just ... the reality . What does this guy want ? Nathan ! Heidi ! Nathan ! Aah ! Heidi ! Hello . Hey . How is she ? She 's been in surgery for ten hours . It 's something with her back , her spine . I should probably call Mom . She 's got the kids . - It 's what Heidi would do . - You have your phone ? Yeah . - You 're not hurt ? - No . Landed 300 feet away from the wreck . Couldn 't tell you how I got there . Couldn 't tell you much of anything at this point . Let me see that , let me see . Yeah , that 's a bad cut . You need to lie down . No , not until Heidi 's all right . - Won 't get a signal . - Do you remember the other car ? - What ? - In the accident . Who told you that ? Who told you that ? I had a dream right before you called . My wife 's in surgery , and you 're dreaming . That 's great . There was another car , wasn 't there ? Nathan . Wasn 't there ? Yeah . It was Linderman 's guys . Must 've found out about the DA 's plans . It 's my fault for even considering it . - Hey ! Look at me . - Taking them on . This is ... this is not your fault . This is Dad 's fault , okay ? And you know , you know that this is not gonna end . If ... If I agree to take the DA 's case , will you give a deposition ? - Hmm ? - Yeah . Against your father ? - Mr. Petrelli ? - Yes ? Please . They did it ! See , the Swallows slay the Dragons ! " The Tokyo Swallows defeated the Chunichi Dragons yesterday with a surprising rally with two out in the ninth . " What , what is this ? Baseball ? You read Japanese flawless . In one day . You have power . I have power too . Okay . So because you knew this baseball team was gonna win , I 'm supposed to believe you 're from the future . There is an ancient Japanese tradition , origami . - Folding paper . - I read about that . Yeah , it says if a person can fold 1000 cranes , - you 'll be granted one wish . - Yes . How did you ... A trip to Japan ? I don 't care if you don 't believe me . Just ... Please tell me you 'll go . Only one ticket ? - Just in case you said yes . - Hai ! Why do you repair watches , Gabriel ? My father didn 't really give me a choice . Yes , but why not do what you want to do ? Why not change ? You use a phrase in your book ... - Evolutionary imperative . - That which we are destined to do . Sea turtles die on the same exact beach where they were born , lions slaughter gazelles , spiders eat their young . They don 't want to . They have to . Well ... The good news is you 're healthy . You mean normal ? - What , there 's still no signs ? - No . Well , maybe tomorrow . We 're still going to the CT scan , right ? I think we should prepare for the possibility that I may have been wrong . You may not have a special ability . I am so close . I can feel it . You came to me ! - I am on your list ! - These tests aren 't 100 % . Don 't give up on me . There are other opportunities I need to focus on . What ... what , these people , huh ? They 're important ? This guy ? Brian Davis , you think he 's ... telekinetic ? Moves things with his mind , or are you just gonna toss him aside too ? You better leave now , Mr. Gray . Wow ! That 's a very generous gift , Hal . Oh , it 's amortized over 10 birthdays . Hell , then , you skimped . - Thanks , Grandpa . - It 's my pleasure , young man . Now , go break the internet in half , or something . If I could buy stock in that kid right now ... God , I wish his teachers saw it that way . We want to move him into a private school , it 's just , you know , we 're trying to figure out the details . Details ? If you 're trying to ask me for something , it 's already yours . It 's a man 's God-give right to dote on his grandson . Thank you . It 'd make a really big difference for us . Well , you know , I feel lucky that you even let me through the door , - after all the things I 've done . - Stop saying that . - You didn 't do anything . - Why do you keep doing that ? Doing what ? You ... you 're only as sick as your secrets , Nicole . I know the mantras , Hal . I 've been reciting them for over a year . Well , I guess I 'll go see what the boy 's up to now . You are doing great . What the hell is this ? You 've torn the whole damned computer apart ! - That computer cost $ 2,000 . - Hey ! - What the hell you think you 're doing ? - You okay ? I have no business being here . Then why did you bother ? I owe you more than an apology could ever do . - What am I supposed to do with this ? - I don 't know . Make your life easier , I don 't care how , okay ? What did you do that was so bad I can 't have my father back ? You really don 't remember , do you ? So what 's going to happen to my Claire ? How is this ... This genetic abnormality going to effect her ? I don 't know . It 's possible nothing might ever happen . It 's possible . I might be wrong . Where did you find this picture ? Union Wells High School website . She 's growing up so quickly now . I couldn 't do anything to stop it . You cannot , try as you might . You have a daughter ? - How old is she ? - She ... was five . I 'm so sorry . Mutations are much like cancers or diseases , meant to eliminate a species . Shanti had a genetic anomaly , and that was the portal into my research . My hope is that no one will suffer as she did . If you do figure this out , what happens then ? We can change the world . Give people hope for the future . That is your daughter 's destiny . I 'd , um , very much like to meet her . You can see how that might be a problem . For my family ? Yes , of course . Let me think on this and the best way to proceed . Well , I appreciate your coming , Mr. Bennett . It was educational . You do remember . Oh , how could I forget ? - Nicole ! - Not Niki . It 's me , Daddy , Jessica . The daughter that you threw beer bottles at . The daughter that you choked . The daughter that you killed . I didn 't kill anyone ! No ... It was an accident . And they left Niki with you to be your punching bag . - I came to apologize , Nicole . - Apologize ? You don 't apologize to Nicole . You apologize to me . Niki doesn 't remember . But I do . Someone had to be there to protect her . I remember the stink of alcohol on your breath . I took every punch , so that she wouldn 't have to . You are not Jessica . You have no idea who I am . Nicole ... You need help . You 're right , she does . I thought she had learned to protect herself , but no such luck . You 're going to go away , and never come back . Cheerleading , huh ? - What do you think ? I think I can 't wait to go to my first game . Ah , well , you might be getting a little bit old for the bears from around the world , but ... - No , I 'm not . - No ? - I love my bears . - Aww . - Am I a terrible person ? - What are you talking about ? I wanna be a cheerleader . I mean , I 've worked hard to be a cheerleader , but ... Sometimes Jackie can just be a ... A bitch . Yeah , a bitch . No , it 's your actions that make you good or bad , cheerleader or not . Let 's take a look at that hand . The pain went away , but I think it 's still kinda ... That 's healed really nicely . Hey , baby . You hungry ? Thought I 'd make some eggs ... carbonara style . Does that sound good ? I didn 't pass again . You studied so hard . It 's not about the answers , Jan. I know all the answers . I don 't know why you don 't just tell them the truth . Yeah , I 'll just waltz in and tell them I can barely read , half the words I see backwards . There 's a good career move . - My baby . - Don 't . Come on . A little morning sex , some eggs ... Everything 's gonna seem so much better . - How can you wanna kiss me ? - You 're my hero . Don 't you know that ? Hey . You are everything that I want . Yeah , I 'm your hero . I 'm a hero . Look at me . 11 years , and I am still directing traffic . Hey . I 'm ready to give the deposition . There isn 't going to be one . What are you talking about ? Can 't back out now , we gotta tell the DA everything . About Linderman , about Dad , all of it . Dad 's dead . He had a heart attack this morning . Take comfort in the fact that he didn 't know his sons were about to stab him in the back . Charlie ! Charlie ! 24-hour Samurai Film Festival at the Drafthouse in Austin ! Austin ? That 's over 300 miles away . We can make it in time to see Yujimbo , Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress . It 'd be perfect for our trip to Japan ! You still do want to go ? Yeah . Oh , yeah . No , it 's not that . It 's just , um , ever since I met you ... I don 't know , you just , you 've made me so happy . You make me happy too . Well , it 's more than that . I don 't let people get very close . There 's a blood clot in my brain ... inches away from an aneurysm . I 'm dying . But ... I 'm supposed to save you . Oh , you did . You did . Before you got here , I 'd decided to give up . But you have made me feel more alive , and more full of joy than I could have ever imagined . Hiro , I love you . Charlie ? No ... Charlie ? Charlie ! Charlie ! Aren 't you and Ando supposed to be ... on vacation in America ? I jumped . Dammit . I have to get back to her . I have to get back to Charlie . Can I help you ? Yeah , um , somebody called me ? My name is Brian Davis . Yes , I called you . My name is ... My name is Sylar . Gabriel Sylar . - It 's incredible . - Can you make it go away ? Why would you wanna do that ? I don 't know what this is . Or who I might hurt . I don 't want it . - You 're broken . - What ? Suresh was right . It 's so clear now . How it all works , pieces fitting together . - It is in the brain . - So you can help . Don 't worry , Brian , I can fix it . It 's an evolutionary imperative . Whatever bad you 've done in the past , it 's over . You have a rare opportunity to start again , to rewrite the past , to do better . But if you 're not interested , we could just put you back in your old life . Odds are you 'd be dead in a week . What do you want me to do ? There 's a professor . Dr. Suresh . He has a list of names . You 're going to get Claire Bennet 's name off that list . - I 'm sorry about the glass . - It 's just glass . About the other day ... I should 've behaved myself . - I was uncalled for , I 'm sorry . - You were angry . A man can say and do the most awful things when he 's angry . Well , I 'm different now . I feel I 've been given a chance to start over . A new life , new identity . New purpose . I came halfway around the world looking for proof , threw him out the door . No one returns my phone calls anymore . They all think I 'm insane . I don 't . These people are all out there waiting to be told that they are important . Waiting to unlock their true potential . I know it . I can feel them . We 'll find them together . We are the future . Hiro . Hiro ! You 're okay ! No , I 'm not okay . What are you talking about ? You teleported back ! I took the bus . I teleported . Forward . Backward . But I couldn 't save her . I couldn 't save Charlie . - So , try again . - It won 't work . This power ... it 's bigger than me . I can 't change the past . No matter how hard I wish . I failed . This list ... You found them . These people ... Their future is written on their DNA . Just as the past , it seems , is written in stone . I have something I have to tell you . Was the die cast from the very beginning ? Or is it in our own hands to alter the course of destiny ? Of all our abilities , it is free will that truly makes us unique . With it , we have a tiny , but potent , chance to deny fate . And only with it can we find our way back to being human . I loved her .

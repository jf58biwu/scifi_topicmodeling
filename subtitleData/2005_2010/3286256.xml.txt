 Like most epidemic ë n , began the loss of so many human lives with a single microscopic organism . GLASGOW , 3 APRIL 2008 Humanity is naturally on Looking for a reason to a disaster like this . But a virus chooses no time or place . There is no hatred , and does not worry . It just happens . ENGLAND / THE BORDER WITH SCOTLAND The Reaper virus spread among the people of Glasgow as a normal colds . You could not stop , there was no no medicine and no vaccine . It took thousands of lives in the first week . This is the end of the world ! In an attempt to stop the virus state of emergency was proclaimed . There were roadblocks set up and there was a curfew imposed . The airports , ports and borders were closed . Scotland was placed in quarantine . The population was invited to stay at home , not to travel and to avoid contact . The people had to sit at home and wait for help that did not . You ! You ! I talk to you ! Beware . He is infected ! No , please . Klootzak ! Towards the fence ! Come on . Pak them ! We are looking for coverage , é ok ? Prepare ! Gas ! Let us inside . Please , take us . - Ga back ! We must go ! - Ga away from the helicopter ! I have a child ! No , what are you doing . Back in the helicopter . Now ! I assume the child ! We have now gone ! Keep your good finds treasure . Everything is good . Fast . Ga back ! Take it easy ! These are the data . Keep your good finds treasure . Eden ! The wall was 20 metres high and made of reinforced steel plates . He followed the line of the former Roman frontier of 2000 years ago . He was 30 kilometers long , from east to west . He informed Great Britain in two ë n . The surrounding waters were full of mines laid and there was patrolled . The sky was as non-vliegzone . And the orders were for each plane that prevent that the rules of the quarantine overtrad . The idea was simple , nobody came out . And nobody went inside . Then they did not worry on the second section . Those who were left behind in the quarantine zone , were abandoned to their fate . The social order was in the extinction , Like the population . The streets were army and the population moisture to survive . The bodies were thousands simultaneously burned . Crime , rape and murder were still dominating . The fire spread from , while the cities were plundered and the last survivors were wanted . They ate dogs , rats and ultimately each other . When the weeks months , they were all dead . Over time , everything was uitgebrand . When was the country north of the wall erased from memory , and ultimately changed the history . In the same way as the government Scotland has dropped , the rest of the world Great Britain ë drop . With hundreds of thousands of unemployed , homeless and without a future . The situation has reached its peak . It is now waiting for the natural laws the balance sheet back into balance . LONDON , 2035 . TODAY . I have my goal in sight . - Start recording . What is this on ? You , bastard ! Extract the suitcase . Let the weapon . Klootzak ! Where is your partner ? Say ! Say , or your life ... Ga back ! Not here , or his brains are spread on the whole boat . Sinclair , whatever you 're planning , do not shoot . What are you doing a damn ? - Sinclair . She is crazy . Make sure they go away ! I commend you not to shoot , Sinclair . You go out . Together with your partner . Be there but not so sure . I killed him , I swear . Sinclair , where are you doing ? Shit ! I 'll never get used to . You know me for a cigarette . When you buy a cigarette ? How much do you think those things cost ? I therefore can better those of you smoking . Michaelson , was a good man . Not the best agent out there . A good man . What is inside ? See for yourself . Whatever happened , he is dead . I can no longer recall how she looks . Everything I have is a name in an envelope with an address where I can never go . I 've seen you fight for permission to get from above . It makes you so angry . If you this way , you as a finite individual to the kloten . Want to do something for me , please ? Ga go home and take your rest . Where do we go ? Ga . Ga back ! Thank you , captain . That 's it . Canaris . - Prime Minister . How long ? - Two hours . It was a routine drugsinval , when she ge ï nfecteerde the victims were . It is the Reaper virus . - Oh , my God . It is back . Hello , George . What 's going on ? I am afraid that it is a national emergency . A meeting with the Premier in five minutes . Let 's informal , and not run around . We all know what is at stake . Jane . In 2023 when the rising water London threatened to onderlopen , we have the Thames vloedbarri è re expanded . Like a moat around a castle , extends this system of canals spread over the entire capital north of the river . Our plan is to the canal under a run , and all bridges and railways to close that the city entry and exit . You want 12 million people individually . Containment is our first priority . Now we have the emergency declaration . Keep the people of the street , so we and medical centres set up blockades . Only then can we start with the evacuation . - Do it ! It 's all so easy for people like sardines in their homes to close . But if you have a deadly virus in that mix throws , then this city moribund . As soon as there appear on the streets , there will be panic created , disorder , there will rapes and murders . And that 's only the beginning . The death toll will be unimaginably high . And when the time comes we can damn nothing more points ! You need to think millions we will survive . Are you talking about people or British pounds ? Hoofdinspecteur Nelson , do you want meelopen even to my office ? If this is a sermon , then shoot a bit . I must do my work , I have on the street . Michael , what we show you is highly confidential and potentially incriminating material . When the wall they have made wild the then Government , what 's on the other side to the hand . So they have a satellite Glasgow and Edinbourgh in the holes leave . More than 30 years , there are photographs , Opgestuurd , and what do you expect ? Empty towns and streets deserted . Until three years ago these pictures published . People . In the streets of Glasgow . - Survivors ? What else can it be ? And if there are survivors then there is also an antidote . We need to address see it . We already have a team ready . We have only one leader . Someone who leads them inwards , find the antidote , and it brings us before it is too late for there is what to do . You do not know how many survivors there are . Maybe the team will find they are not on time , maybe they found nothing . They can still infectious . That is the team out . You knew damn all three years that that there were survivors , and you have the cover-up stopped . We could still do nothing . If I yesterday with a survivor on the 6 o 'clock news would appear , they would me to the nearest lamppost on my balls hanging . But if I leave within 48 hours with a survivor and the antidote to the news appear , they obviously no ball to those surviving . But they are in the queue waiting to my ass a cushion for the antidote . In politics is a matter of survival of timing , and this is the moment . We have 48 hours . We have you best man , and now . Ok é . I know someone who is suitable for it . Step in , it pours outside . How long they knew it all ? - Long enough , but that does not matter now . For me , yes . For whom do we do it ? - I tell you not on holiday . Concentrate on the mission . Who 's behind it ? Hatcher ? Hatcher is a part of it , But it is that Canaris the reins in his hands . He is the force behind this mission , and he is not someone where you quarrel would like to have . Who , me ? - I believe it . They all want to go with the honor . Hatcher and the government , the whole damned system . That leaves Canaris never . Once you on the other side of that wall are , There are no rules and no help . - That I have not needed . Do you want this for me ? You 've certainly not a cigarette ? You may not smoke in the helicopter if I do not smoke . Ok é . Dr. Mark Kane led the investigation to the virus when the gates dichtgingen . He was stuck in the laboratory . His laboratory was in the quarantine department in Glasgow . If someone could develop an antidote then he was it . I suggest that you begin at the laboratory , and from there go looking for . You rendez-vous with the rest of the team is in the wall . Then you go ga to the north , you have to transport . Why do not we fly ? - Scotland is still a non-vliegzone . Hatcher wants this mission remains secret . So if we do not work out , know nobody that we are there . You have 46 hours . If you find nothing , the centre of London everyone who lives there and die . If you think that I will find . This you need , it 's a GPS Locater which tells us exactly where you are . It says that a helicopter ready your team back again . That call them secret . Once you have the antidote it does not matter anymore . What happens if we find nothing ? Then you do not have to come back . What are we doing damn , Canaris ? Quietly , and listen . Even though Sinclair by a miracle where she is looking for , and back in time . The fact remains that the our debt , we are responsible . Too many people in a hope so they can barely move . We have the perfect situation for a virus created ë erd . The more we save now , how greater the chance that the weather happens . We have a chance to to give us some space . What do you mean by that ? Start a war , Prime Minister . These are the basic rules of war . Let the dying die . - While the whole world looking on ? With so much protesteerders , we can just do what we want . THE MUUR - 3 HOURS LATER . Captain Sinclair , you have a good flight ? - Ok é . Sergeant Hook , welcome to limbo . Why do you call it ? There is no longer living soul confess behind that wall , except our own . No exceptions ? No , the whole system is 20 years ago fully automated . Today it is only wild what they get . The team arrived two hours ago . They are within the equipment . We must hurry up , sergeant . The time is working against us . Yes , Sir . Is the team already ge ï nformeerd ? I have them contracts , objectives and the file of Dr. Kane . Captain Sinclair ? I 'm Chandler of the Armored Division . Today I am the driver . They see there might not matter but they go if the fire department . A 12-cylinder engine , a two-inch armoured plate which is blocking everything of 30 millimetre artillery chemical weapons . Since we can do with it . Where have they found ? A patrol found them just behind the wall . Since the system is fully automated has become , they were no longer needed . These are the last two who still serve . Major , this is Corporal Read . Tankbestuurder . Majoor . - Ga continue with your work , Corporal . Soldiers Miller and Carpenter . - Major . What have we here ? BIO-6 , gevechtsmodel . Kogelvrije flexible vests . These give full liberty and 24-hour protection . Exactly what a woman needs . Prototype , silicone rookgranaat .

You were part of the delegation who wanted to destroy the virus . That 's right . Nice to meet you , Major . I took part in 2024 , Stirling came in 2031 . Until a few years Hatcher decided to ago to pull the plug . We 've tried everything , but without result . I hope that this mission from you the risk is worth , Majoor . Probably someone thinks so . Ok , listen . I want everyone in 10 minutes in full equipment ready . The wall leaving ! Automatic restraint off . Ok é , Chandler . To inside . Shit ! - Sergeant , what was that ? What 's wrong , Chandler ? I think we hit something ? - Major . Say that again . I think you can look even better . Soldier Miller , ga 's look . Chandler , shooting a flare into the sky . Chandler , which is black and white and is scattered everywhere ? You probably do not know , a cow is the right answer . In motion . - É Ok , come back inside . This farm is already 25 years . The government seeks this information for the population to hide . They do not want the people know how bad it is . They think that we are no longer can continue . Ethics has abandoned these people . It seems that he has sunk with a number of stranded soldiers . She continued the run hospital as well as they could . They remained through the regular legerfrequentie broadcast reports , by the use of their transmitter , until the current comparison . The virus has spread , deliveries are stopped and affects the water quickly . At night we hear in the distance the screams of pain in English . They have begun to eat each other . The evil is beyond arrived . We have almost no ammunition . The barricades will not much longer . Our time is running out . This is Dr .. Marcus Kane , who quit . What do the numbers ?

I knew the damn ! I knew that he lied damn ! - Who lied ? Can ! You know , he let us believe that there outside it was nothing . No hope of rescue . But I knew that one day someone would come and to prove the opposite . If Kane is still alive then I must find him . Save your breath . You can now relax . You will remain alive only as long as we do need . Look , if you come from behind the wall , then you have a plan to go back . We have previously tried , and have failed .

And if he comes out where you come from he will also come your murder . Since there Vandoor Sol has gone , nobody trusts him more . Even me . His people are always in close proximity to to protect him . Those who deal with them being tortured or murdered . You live in a world behind the wall .

We need as quickly as possible to allow Kane and this is the quickest way . Ok é . Fuck it . I hope you know what you 're doing . I knew that she cities in the eye would hold .

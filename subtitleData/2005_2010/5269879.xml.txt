expertease in this area but there could be midigating cercomstances im not looking for a deal this could mean the difference between a life sentence and the death penalty this was a mistake look i can

sobbing well do it your way thankyou i 'll still have to know what happened hm you would 'nt believe me a harverd educated physician who saves lives by day and takes them by night how much more dificult to believe can it be may i may i ask you a personal question id prefer to talk about you if you were forced to choose would you call yourself good or evil good i guess yet youve had evil thoughts and occcasionaly acted on them havent we all well you see its something ive always been facinated with ever since i can remember that how on an intrinsic level it seems we have two distinc selfs within us one good one bad each struggling for control and as a doctor i i wonder could it be the key to understanding the very nature of health and illness well for years it was just a private theory one i kept to myself then a year ago something amazing happened it changed all that as if it were meant to be when i was in the amazon deep in the rain forest treating remote tribes i came across a sharmon who worshiped a rare flower he belives it caused the sole to seperate allowing the dark self to escape allowing the light self to heal like nothing ever seen before later i took a blood sample from the sharmon and tested it even his genetic makeup had changed i had to find the flower id finally succeeded in isolating its psycotropic properties a catolist to trigger the effect the question was what for months it was all i could think about a blinding obsession the more i searched for the answer the more out of reach it seemed then just as i was about to quit singing " i 'll hold your hand while they drag the river " " i 'll cuddle you and me unto town " " i 'll keep my hands on your trigger finger " " i 'll take you down where the train tracks go " let 's whale away the hours let 's whale the evil night together " " we 'll drink a toast in your torture chamber " " and you 'll go down on a bed of nails " edward ... ..... hyde that 's what he call 's him self even has a name at first only taking the serum would make him emerge and i could control him and the experiment then he became more violent stronger and began appearing at will how often every week or two in the begining always at night and then with increasing frequency the more i tried to suppress him which triggered his erge to kill i see you dont believe me do you think im making this up if im going to be your lawyer then it doesnt matter what i personaly believe i 'll prepare a statment of facts then we 'll arrange for to turn yourself in i 'll have you committed for 24 hours committed a psychiatric ward im afraid something might happen again yes its awful about mr lanion i have no idea if and when he 'll be back you said he had a heart attack about a week ago thats him right there here it is 2 / 12 battery st apartment 4f it says it was leased to edward hyde and paid for by henry jekyll why is that sorry im just a temp i dont suppose you have an extra key gosh i dont know if i can no its okay im henry jekyll 's atorney well i guess its okay i think they keep the keys in the back how can you send him to me why whats he done you say you know him so well how well ive known him many years he treated my wifes tumor what about mental illness any history i mean as far as i know no drug abuse delusions abnormal behaviour of any kind claire henry is the most peaceful person i know well then he 's covering up for someone ever heard of a person named edward hyde who never mind your busy ive taken enought of your time but you are going to help him arnt you i dont know im not sure i want to get involved do you miss me i mean what a way to treat a dear friend first locks on the door and the looney bin cant be so ungrateful to be given the freedom to experience the darkest thrills of the human soul without anyone suspecting your not real oh well you see your wrong your lucky i still need you around or youd have been gone a long time ago what do you want stop being a baby suck it up you realize that only by execpting me can you finally except yourself im not you no im a good man boring that 's why your here your all in my head testing myself just think of all the

defence ready yes your honor very well regarding the defendants plea your honor if i may id like to move for a continuance on what grounds new evidence which might have a bearing on my clients plea what are you doing objection your honor any thing relivent to this case should have been handed over to us prior to this hearring i found out about it last night and im supposed to believe that well regarding this new evidence coucilor you 'll share it with the district attorney imediantly and be prepared to enter a plea first thing in the morning court is ajurned untill then to plead guilty thats all i wont well thats it its a guy in a hood so what what if he 's actualy the one who killed all these people for god sake wheaton your clients signed a full confesion we found blood from three diferent victims in his house to say nothing of the d.n.a. evidence linking him to every one of the crime scenes come on well there is someone else involved and his name is edward hyde there is no edward hyde and you know it look i know you suckered me into this delay but you are going to have to do better than this hail mary you pulled of some grainy skid row security camera listen given the bazar elements of the case i think we both know i can make an insanity defence stick hm ... what do you want to bring this guy in if it turns out to be nothing my client will plead guilty accross the board no conditions you have my word his name is walter swain the crack head not exactly what you call relyable but he recognised hyde from the security camera sort of possibly maybe thats the best we could get out of him all right cut him loose what you cant hold him on what charge well at least let me ask him a few questions no i think we have pursed this avenue sufficently you remember the deal now if you will excuse me i have a plea hearing to reschedule unbelievable excuse me excuse me what now you people have harassed me enough already im not the police im an attorney well what ever your selling im not interested its about edward hyde so you do know him yeah from a bar i think we talked once thats it look i need to find him do you know where he is listen please someone 's life is at stake he said the cops were after him he didnt say why said he was going to lay low for a while you know where he is some place safe thats all he said anyway ive got to go if he contacts you or if you

going to have to help me we have a deal deal hi mrs manion .. claire i just want to say how sorry i am thankyou did you know my husband not very well it just seems so sudden do you mind me asking just what happened complications from a heart attack i heard he had heart problems just wonder was it that off do you know it was very odd id never seen him that way he was like a frightened child what do you mean well just before he slipped into the coma he said the oddest thing at first i thought he was delirious but he said he could feel eyes boring into him cold , hipnotic eyes of a man as he lay there in that alley where they found him he said he saw a man change into someone else right there in front of him pure evil thankyou can we have some privacy ive requested you be taken off the case listen i made a mistake please just give me a second chance please im begging you i know you were telling me the truth i dont care anymore and its better that i get the death sentence listen to me if a killer takes a hostage who he forces to come along with him while committing his crimes that hostage cant be blamed who cares i care look hoestly what ever guilt you feel hear your innocent hyde did it its like you said hes a different body person and soul well it to late is the only way i can get rid off him is by dying and i just want to die do you remember me alone and unforgiven shut up shut up oh look at you why why did you do this to me you wanted me dont take me away from him i liked you claire i liked you very much please are you okay im okay we have all been waiting for the day when doctor jekyll is expected to enter his plea will it be guilty or not guilty thankyou how do you feel i feel great did he come back no no he is am hes gone can i trust you well i ive allways told you the truth your going to have to trust me now will the defendant please rise to each of the six charges of first degree murder how do you plead not guilty your honor order order in the court order insanity defence good luck who said anything about insanity so doctor how would you define dissociate identity disorder its a condition in where a single individual evidences to 2 or more distinct personalities each with its own patterns of perceving and interacting with the inviroment now in your own profesional experiance do patients ever pretend to sufer from this condition yes usualy within a legal context as part of an insanity defence what if the problem of diagnosing d.i.d is that there is no way to objectively prove that the condition exists no objective way of prooving it exists so if i get this right doctor then this mr hyde of hume i may add have no records off he could be a complete and total fabrication of dr jekyll yes so mr swane how many times did you see mr hyde why we hung out in bars and stuff so you could identify mr hyde if you ever saw him again yes sure have you ever seen the defendant dr jekyll no could he be mistaken for mr hyde yes its funny yeah i guess he could but ah hes nothing like the guy im talking about when you see his eyes once your never going to forget them so this mr hyde he exsists yeah hes for real were you under the influance mr swane when you supposedly saw this supposed mr hyde yeah n no ah maybe yeah no maybe okay thankyou so much for your cooperation sometimes very late at night i could hear the voice of this other person yelling and screaming it was terifying did you ever meat mr hyde yes once just an evil person i could see it in his face i new that he was there to harm dr jekyll and there was nothing i could do we recoverd d.n.a. left on each victim at each of the crime scenes on each of the murder weapons all were found to contain the same genetic markers all matching the defendent all and what are the odds mr fowler that these markers can belong to someone anyone other than the defendant approximately 170 million to one realy its what hes devoted to preserving lives not taking them and you know this because he did everything in his power to save my wife she didnt have much hope maybe six months to live then he helped her to die with grace and dignity and it was more than just doctors skills , compassion she trusted him right to the end henry jekyll the henry jekyll i know could never do these horrible things well whats the deal they offered how bad guilty by reason of insanity in exchange for twenty to life without parol or take your chances with the jury which i can feel im loosing and risk a death sentence what does henry say only that he trusts me so what do i do what are your instincts tell you my instincts have been wrong before look what ever you decide dont give up on henry id like to call my client to the stand dr jekyll why did confess to crimes you never committed the experiments that i carry out for my research involve injestion of psycotropic substances they provoke extream reactions psycological and physical i had a moment of doubt i might have been the one responsible for these hannes crimes so am i to understand you had a moment of confusion yes dr jekyll do you know mr hyde yes i do know mr hyde how would you discribe him to me mr hyde is an enigma i dont how he found me or why he ever came to my home i dont think i 'll realy ever understand but what i do know is that when i emerge from this very uncomfortable jurney i was accused of murders that he seemed to have committed thankyou no further questions after all the twists and turns this trial has taken the outcome at this point seems to be quite uncertain well have to wait and see wether the defence or the prosecution has any more tricks up there sleeves thankyou thankyou claire i listen dont thank me yet it uh not over oh it doesnt matter im free from him for what i wanted what ever happens now cant change that good cause im not finished yet your honor we 'd like to recall the states d.n.a. expert mr fowler mr fowler isnt it true there are sections of human d.n.a. that are unique to each individual there called polymorphic fragments they very in shape from person to person so esentualy d.n.a. profiling is the process of seperating an idividuals unique polymorphic fragments from those of others thats right you ever heard of one person having two unique sets of polymorphic fragments by definition that would be impossible why is that because the genetic coding of each persons polymorphic fragments is intirly unique to that person im sorry mr fowler in that case why is henry jekyll on trial here instead of edard hyde objection your honor jekyll and hyde are one in the same person well that is false your honor um henry jekyll and mr hyde are two different persons what makes you say that counciler because according to samples taken by the police from hydes apartment the d.n.a. of dr jekyll and mr hyde are not the same what its a fact your team missed mr fowler why was that because he was so convinced that henry jekyll and mr hyde were the same person he carelessly failed to compare there d.n.a. only one person fits the exact profile of the killer and that person is mr edward hyde its all in your report mr fowler thankyou no further questions ladies and gentlemen of the jury you herd the testimonies attesting to dr jekyll 's charector he is the opposit of a killer he is a healer and a man of vision and a man of compasion the truth is simple convicting him beyond any reasonable doubt would mean disregarding any definition of what constitutes a human being his d.n.a. the d.n.a. found at the scenes of these barbaric crimes do not belong to dr jekyll but to another man dr jekyll cant be held responsible for these herendus acts the one and only person guilty is mr edward hyde ladies and gentlemen the killer is still out there and hes ready to strike again thankyou allmost three hours now well two hours 43 minutes to be exact since the jury began its deliberations and given the lateness of the hour its unlikely a verdict will be decided untill wait we are just getting word now that the jury is back and we will bring you all the details as soon as they are available will the defendant please rise in the matter of the state versus henry jekyll we the jury find the defendent not guilty order in the court thankyou hows it feel strange to get your life back well to now im finaly myself again i assume you want that envelope back envelope yeah when you gave ne incase oh right oh well you can throw it away you sure ... better yet burn it forget he even gave it to you im sorry no its okay realy no its what you said what i said you said he forget he gave it to you did i well i meant me who else would i mean hahaha yeah well gabe come on you dont think i had to ask guess you have every right after all thats happened but

 - LUKE : I 'm feeling anxious . - So am I. - You 've been to school before . - Not this one . - Name ? - Clyde Langer . Troublemaker . ( SCREAMING ) What 's wrong with this place ? It stinks , the food 's rotten . Something weird 's going on . - That 's a bit flashy . - It 's a new building . There was an article about it . - I did a job in a school that looked like that . - Was it built by Coldfire Construction ? May I help you ? We 'll use him to solve the storage problem ! - BLAKEMAN : A 1 4-year-old human ? - Yep . Lights out , London ! SARAH JANE : See if you can find where that smell 's coming from . She really shouldn 't be hanging around school after home time . - Was that a threat ? - Yes . ( LAUGHING ) MARIA : Come on ! Run ! It 's no fun if you don 't run ! The smell of human fear , love it ! - Is there a way out through here ? - No , there 's no way out . So , Luke . How do you like our little science project ? I am a child of the Slitheen and this is my hunt ! Run ! Oh , no ! ( GROWLING ) Come on , boy . Don 't you want a closer look ? - Good sense of smell , have you ? - Best nostrils in the galaxy , official ! - And you like my perfume ? - Lovely ! Then sniff this ! ( WHINING ) ( GROWLING ) - I 've found a secret room . - Not now ! - Get it open ! - It 's locked ! That thing 's real , isn 't it ? - CARL : This place is sealed ! You 're finished ! - This way ! ( LAUGHING ) - Maria ! - CLYDE : Come on ! Maria ! ( PHONE LINE RINGING ) - Luke ! - Sarah Jane . - I was wrong , it is aliens . - I know ! ( GROWLING ) - Listen ... - You 've got to make a big smell ! What , fart our way out ? - Would that be funny ? - What ? JEFFREY : Come out , little ones ... CARL : They 're nearby , Daddy . I can smell you . - A strong smell . Think ! - A skunk ? - Yes ! - " Wolverine . Pure masculine action . " ( GROWLING ) ( COUGHING ) Go , go , go ! Hunt them . ( GROWLING ) - MARIA : Wait for me . - Sarah Jane ! LUKE : Sarah Jane ! - Into the car ! - BLAKEMAN : Come on , hurry ! - What 's that ? - Sonic lipstick . - What is he doing here ? - Sorry . Somebody else 's life in my hands , just what I needed ! JEFFREY : They 're getting away ! That 's not fair ! That woman cheated ! - I want my hunt ! - Come here . That woman had some sonic disruptor . This is a level 5 planet , they 're primitives . How did she get that ? Who is she ? The galactic police . She could be one of their agents . No , she 's human , she smelt soupy , they all do . If that 's her only weapon , she 's no big deal . Daddy . I want my hunt ! You 'll have your hunt later , I promise . Tonight 's the night the lights go out ! ( ALL LAUGHING ) I 've been chased by aliens and you aren 't even freaking out . Why ? - Who are you ? - Go home , forget this ever happened . Go home . No , I 'm gonna find out the truth . - What 's in there and who 's that woman ? - Just leave us alone . The police won 't leave you alone when call ' em I tell ' em . - Show me ! - Okay ! We 've waited so long for this moment . - Times have been hard . - They 've been closing in on us , Judoon forcing us out , the other families against us . This will give us a new beginning , wealth , security . When we have the money , what then ? We 'll buy a fleet of battle cruisers . Return home to Raxacoricofallapatorius . I shall smite the Grand Council , crush the Senate . The Blathereen and the Hostrozeen will beg for mercy at my feet ! But we mustn 't get carried away . We have the equation , nothing can stop us . Now it begins ! - The inhabitants of Raxa ... Raxa ... Oh ! - Raxacoricofallapatorius . The Slitheen family are thieves , known to infiltrate low-tech planets by hiding in the skins of the dominant native species . - Slitheen in Downing Street . - What ? Something a friend said once . Gas exchange from skin compression often results in ... - Farting . Farting 's funny . - Right , what 's going on in here ? - Why don 't you bring all your friends ? - Who 's gonna believe him ? No one 's telling me what 's going ... Shut up , I 'm busy , and right now you 're not important . Even if it is getting like Clapham Junction here . The Slitheen must have taken over Coldfire Construction , - put up buildings all around the world . Why ? - I think I know . There 's a hidden room in the school . - What 's in there ? - I 've a theory . Mr Smith could help . - Who 's that , your dad ? - Mr Smith , I need you ! - MR SMITH : Good afternoon . - Oh , yes ! Is that a computer ? - Who 's that ? - Nobody . Luke would like some help . - Certainly . Hello . - Hello . Bring up our satellite image of London . Now plot the positions of every school block put up by Coldfire Construction . Ealing , that 's us . St Cheldon 's . Schools at Epping , Richmond ... The ends of tube lines . If I 'm allowed to speak . This is real , the talking computer 's real , the Slitheens are real . Oh , yes ! Plot the position of every Coldfire building put up in the last 1 8 months around the world . - Accessing ... - SARAH JANE : Paris , Sydney , Beijing ... A few , not all capital cities , spread all over the place . They look pretty random . Underground railways . They 've all got underground railways ! - Don 't have to thank me . - Link them . MR SMITH : London , Barcelona , Washington DC , Santiago , Los Angeles , Sydney , Beijing , - Moscow , Naples , Paris . - There 's at least one Slitheen at every site . And there are 1 0 cities , 1 0 sites . Call the army . - That makes things better , doesn 't it ? - It 's not your job . There 's a cleverer way of going about things . What are they doing ? Secret room , what was in there ? I 've done something really stupid . A really bad social mistake . I told the Slitheen how to destroy the world . I 've input the boy 's catalyst equation . Now it works perfectly ! We 'll take the night side first , build up the charge section by section . And then ... This is Glune Fex Fize Sharleveer Slam Slitheen to all Slitheen units . Is everybody ready ? It wasn 't working until I went and gave him the answers . SARAH JANE : Oh , Luke ... - The power cut was a test run . - Our candles went out and that 's not electric . MR SMITH : When the capacitors are charged they act as transducers , converting heat and light into electrical energy . That 's how the loop works , it 's not connected physically . - What about the underground railways ? - The system must generate heat . The underground railways act as a cooling system ! People getting ill , the food going off , that 's the effect of the capacitors . Indeed . Even on standby , the transducers would cause cellular decay . They can drain every last drop of energy . Our school 's the last link . It needs the whole chain , all together , to do that ? - Yeah . - We bomb the school ? Could you destroy the entire system safely ? I think so . If we reset the system , shut it down for a second . - I 'd need a cutting tool . - What about this ? - MARIA : How do we get past the Slitheen ? - We bomb them ! I 've just picked up this report on an American news channel . There 's a massive loss of power on the West Coast of North America . Los Angeles has gone dark . - It 's starting . - And I told them how to do it . I saved the world and now I 've helped to destroy it . It works ! Section 1 down ! Grazie , Napoli ! Thank you ! Moving to section 2 . Hello , Washington DC ! - SLITHEEN : Howdy , London ! - Connect ! Mr Smith , give me everything on the inhabitants ... - Raxacoricofallapatorius . - You 're making that up . - Anything we can use to fight them . - Accessing . - Anybody could have made that mistake . - No , only he could . Let 's have a High School Musical moment . A group hug 'll sort everything . As if a teacher could have worked out that diagram . And the power loss is spreading westwards . China is now without power , and it may be only a matter of time before the effect spreads here . Oh , boy . MR SMITH : I have lost the signal . - Anything on the Slitheen yet ? - Accessing . Come on ! Section 9 clear . Dormez bien , Paris ! - That makes us next . - So , synchronize the megawattage . Oh , for the love of Clom ! SARAH JANE : Mr Smith does like to take his time . Come on . Raxacoricofallapatorians , calcium-based life forms . - Give us the weaknesses ! - Weaknesses . They are a naturally hardy race . - However , their bodies are hyper-sensitive to ... - No ! ON RADIO : The Prime Minister has promised that the blackouts will not affect the UK . Thank you , Prime Minister . - We can 't stop them without the sonic lipstick . - It 's real . The end of the world . - Will you shut up ! - No Mr Smith . No sonic lipstick . No Plan B. But we are the only people in the world who can stop this . And we will . Time to go back to school ! Without the sonic thing we can 't stop them ! They 'll get us before ... If you can 't say anything useful , go home ! The Slitheen Jeffrey went mad when he nicked my bag . - So ? - What 's a Slitheen gonna care about that ? - You saw him , he was scared ! - What was in that bag ? My books , some Tangfastics , and my lunch . - What was in your lunch ? - Cold chip sandwich . I wasn 't gonna eat from the canteen . Slitheen are allergic to potato ? Bread ? No , the Slitheen in the office had a sandwich . What was on the chips ? - Just salt and vinegar . - Salt ! Must be it . If the Slitheen are made mostly of water , it would dehydrate them , like slugs . No , they put extra salt in everything . It 's gotta be the vinegar ! That 's acetic acid . It reacts with calcium . The Slitheen are made of calcium ! It 's the vinegar ! Kitchen ! What are we gonna do , stand there and throw pickled eggs at them ? Get it all into these . - I was joking . - The car won 't start . - How do we get back to school ? - We run ! The capacitors are charged ! Time for the coup de grace . The denouement . Daddy , you promised I could do it . It 's appropriate , don 't you think ? We are doing this for our children . Yes . A new beginning for a new generation of Slitheen . Go ahead , lad . Turn out the sun . MAN : The car stopped , engine 's dead . They 're all dead . CLYDE : So you 've been fighting aliens for years ? - Not now . - Did you actually go up to the career guy and say " I want to defend the planet " ? - Not exactly . - So how did it start ? It 's a long story and if we survive , I 'll be happy to tell you . - CLYDE : What 's going on ? - It 's transduction , like the candles . - They 've switched off the sun ! - They 're draining its power . - We 've got about 32 minutes . - Everyone 's gonna die . - We 're going to stop them ! - The four of us ? With vinegar in squeezies ? - Where 's Maria ? - She 's at her mates , I think . - This is the end of the world ! - It 's a power cut , Chrissie . The nights are drawing in , you think it 's the end of the world . Look out there ! The sun 's blue , it 's freezing ! Where is Maria ? - Daddy ! She 's come back ! - So ? She 's an old woman with a funny lipstick . - My hunt ! - Uh-uh ! I think an adult better deal with them . ( LAUGHING ) - They just let us walk in here . - They want us here . - What luck , we want to be in here . The room ? - It 's this way . Ah , human children . The stench of Haribo and chicken nuggets . - Get off this planet ! - Ssh ! Now it 's time to hunt . The hunt is an instinct with us , the only way to keep our food safe when the Baaraddelskelliumfatrexius Beasts wandered the plains of Raxacoricofallapatorius . - The what ? - Like giant squirrels . We killed them all . - But the hunting instinct remains ! - Now ! - Didn 't like that , did you ? - Vinegar ! Get back ! - Sarah Jane , this way ! - Maria ! It 's working . - We 're doing our bit , you do yours ! - One step further ... ( GROWLING ) Keep back ! You 're afraid . A Slitheen girl your age would do it . But all the fight 's gone out of you . You just stand there shaking in your shoes . That 's why we survive , that 's why you 're losers , all of you on this rubbish planet ... That 's why we win ! ( GROANING ) Oops . Oh , great ! I did it . I exploded the headmaster . ( WHINING ) - One of the family ... Something 's wrong ! - Daddy , look ! JEFFREY : It 's Glune , he 's been ... vinegared ! This is Kist Magg Thek Lutovin Day Slitheen calling the family . We are under attack ! Glune Fex Fize is dead . Emergency Plan A , all operators here , now ! - Daddy ! - Everything 's going to be all right . They 're here . In here . JEFFREY : And so are our uninvited guests ! Behold , the capacitor ! We drain the energy into these and store it . In ten minutes this planet 's atmosphere gets snatched away , but we 'll be safe and warm in here . And then a spacecraft picks us up and we sell everything we 've collected . - Why are you doing this ? - The Family came here once before , just a routine job , but they never came back . I think I might know what happened ... Who happened . This planet will pay in blood ! - They were our family ! - And Luke is mine ! This will give us a new beginning . My son won 't have to live like I had to , cringing in the darkness . And I want my son to live , to grow up , I want what 's best for him ! - Your stupid son gave us what we needed . - I didn 't . - What ? - I didn 't . You made the mistake . You didn 't tell me that you were going to steal power from the sun . It 'll explode . - It 's a bluff ! - What 's a bluff ? - Well , the boy might be right ... - It 's happening . Turn it off ! - Turn it off ! There 's vinegar in this ! - JANINE : Water ! - That 's a bluff ! - I knew that wouldn 't work . If I reset the system , you can cancel the overload , make it safe ? - Yes . - Right . Son , reset the system ! ( APPLAUDING ) It 's reset . The system 's off . I 'll just have to synchronise the megawattage . - Now ! - Daddy ! Mum ! Get him ! ( SCREAMING ) - It 's going to blow up ! - Out now ! JEFFREY : It 's out of control ! JANINE : Wait for me ! Resynchronize the megawattage ! Quickly , we 've got to get out of here ! You can 't leave us in here ! Use your sonic device . Open the door ! I 'm only 1 2 ! He 's my son ! Please , let him live . - Luke . - You can 't let them out ! ( SCREAMING ) - It 's burnt itself out . - We did it ! - He was a child . Twelve years old . - It was them or us ! CLYDE : Some of the Slitheen got away , I saw them vanish . LUKE : Their machine 's useless now . MARIA : Except there 's buildings round the world with secret rooms and alien machinery . Bye now , love to the Brig ! Just sorted that . Some friends are going to clear it up . - Friends from UNIT ? - Uh-huh . What 's UNIT , a furniture shop ? Where were you ? Come here ! Where have you been ? - We went up town , got some burgers . - The power went off . I was so worried ! - Now it 's back on . - Sally Anne , bless you for looking after my Maria . My head was full of terrible things . - Where have you been ? - What do you mean ? - Such a useless liar . - Shut up , Alan . Did you see the sun ? It went blue ! I 've heard of a blue moon , that 's quite romantic , but it was terrifying ! - I was going make tea , are you staying ? - Don 't tell me , Tuesday , Spanish omelette . - As it happens . - So predictable . - Go on , twist my arm . I 'll suffer your cooking . - That 's brilliant ! I may not be living here , but at least I 'm still looking after you . - ' Cause I am so useless . - You are ! You lost her ! - She was off gallivanting with Suzie Q ! - Her name is Sarah Jane . Whatever , Sarah Jane . Tell you what , though . Funny things have been happening . I 'm beginning to get suspicious . - Suspicious of what ? - Think about it . You move in opposite Sarah Jane and everyone turns into zombies . You 're with Sarah Jane and the pop factory blows up . You go off with Sarah Jane and the sun goes out . Ask yourself , what have those things got in common , or rather , who have they got in common ? - I don 't know . - Me . It 's all happening to me ! I just can 't move for disasters , it 's like I 'm cursed ! - What 's that for , sweetheart ? - It 's ' cause you 're cursed ! Here 's your reward . A nice cuppa . Do you mind ? Make sure you put that back where it belongs . - Is this from outer space ? - No , Venezuela . - You ask too many questions . - Too late to stop me now . I suppose . That 's how I got started , asking questions . But you never told me . How did you discover aliens and things ? I met this man called the Doctor . He was an alien too . - What , like a big green thing ? - No , he looked just like you and me , except he was nothing like you and me . He took me out into space , far away from Earth . - You 've travelled through space ? - And time . I saw planets , galaxies and all sorts of creatures . Things you would never imagine . - So where is he now , then , this Doctor ? - Still out there . Still wandering . Still wonderful . And he left me behind with his legacy , I suppose . To help , and to protect , to make a stand and to never give up . - He sounds cool . - Cool ? Yeah . - So are you gonna see him again ? - I hope so . You can 't tell anyone about these things . It 's got to be our secret . - Can I trust you ? - Yeah . Promise . - Thank you . - LUKE : Sarah Jane , Maria 's here . - Coming ! - He 's gone back to calling you Sarah Jane . - It should be " Mum " . - You think ? - Yeah , tell him . - I don 't know how . Diagnostic checks completed . All systems are functioning normally . While they 're downstairs , where are you from ? - All systems are functioning normally . - Who built you ? All systems are functioning normally . Beware your curiosity , boy . - MARIA : Freak weather conditions ? - Temporary reversals of the magnetic poles ? That 's the one . Mr Smith , start a rumour . Insert the words , " temporary reversal of the magnetic poles " into media reports . - Confirmed . - Can 't believe we can 't tell anyone . - I should get millions for what I did today . - We all did it . Who worked out the vinegar ? Thank you , Clyde Langer ! I 'll walk you to the bus stop . This is great . Weird , but great . You lot need me . I can 't believe you were gonna save those Slitheen . They tried to destroy the entire planet . What was the big dilemma ? - Bus stop . - You were good . If anyone says you 're not cool , I 'll set ' em right . He 's right . Oh , you were amazing ! Again . - I nearly destroyed everything . I messed up . - I messed up . New block , the strangeness of it ... I should have seen it . Instead , I sent you and Maria right in there . - And that was nearly the end of you . - But I 'm still here . Always will be , Mum . ( LAUGHS ) SARAH JANE : The Lavender Lawns rest home is being haunted by a nun . - Help me . - Doesn 't Mr Smith believe in ghosts ? Not as such , and neither do I. CLYDE : When weirdo nuns turn up asking about freaky alien gizmos , one thing you never do is tell them you 've got one . - The talisman is dangerous ? - More than you can imagine . No wait , Luke ! - The Abbess will want to see you . - The Abbess ? Luke , he 's been nabbed by a nun . SARAH JANE : Are you really protecting a Gorgon here ? A creature with writhing serpents for hair ... The sisters , they protect her . Look on the face of the Gorgon and feel your flesh turn to stone . ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) DVD Rip by DrMatt 2008

 What do you think , kids ? Isn 't it beautiful ? Where do you think the clinic is ? That 's where Two be . Who are you people ? Newcomers . So , where have you come from ? We just got off the bus . But where did you get on the bus ? Well , the village . No , this is the village , you 've arrived here . Well , isn 't that just the wildest thing ? Ah , sir , your car is waiting . Mr. Curtis is expecting you in 44 minutes . Your car is right outside . In 43 minutes . They 're building houses , busing people in , that has to mean something . Yeah , " More Village . " Be still , please . What is this anyway ? Your name came up on the test list . The village is all that there is , and now , there are newcomers . How can they say that 's possible ? You 're right . I say as though it was something ordinary . We all say , " More Village . " Oh , uh ... What is it ? Aren 't they splendid ? Isn 't this just the most wonderful thing ? They 're buildings , houses . 11-12 , you could not be more profoundly wrong . " More Village " , means that our way of life is becoming the very consciousness of the universe . I exaggerate , of course , but only slightly . Oh , indulge me . Take it all in . This moment will be handed down through generations of our family . There will be generations of our family , Won 't there , 11-12 ? Yes . I suppose . Oh dear , oh dear , 11-12 you 're so ... earnest . Take a tip from your old man .. unbutton yourself ! Enjoy life ! Dance the night away with some darling girl . What is this ? Is it perhaps your certificate of dying ? Why now ? You coulda killed me a thousand times . I 've tried every way I know to help you to belong , But still , you refuse . You choose this life or no life . Assimilate or die ? That is the great gift of village death . Clarity of choice . Oh Two , it 's you . Two in person . I-I would ask for your autograph , but I don 't have a pen . There are people here , Six . Good people . Newcomers . Look at them . Hi ! They choose life . But you . I 'll find a way out before I die . Oh , Six . Let me give the very secret of life . Breath in ... Breath out . More ... village . I shall watch you die , one breath at a time , Six . One ... tick of the clock at a time . Tk , tk . Tk , tk . Tk , tk . I said , " Don 't look at me . " Pity about poor ol ' Six . How does that make you feel , 313 ? Be honest . If you can 't confide in Two , who can you confide in ? I wish you 'd .. would help him . There 's something inside Six that refuses to be unlocked , and perhaps the prospect of death will unlock him . Death unlocks us all . And still , he clings to his abstinence . Freedom . Such touching faiths , one envies him , almost . But you and I know better . I 'm sorry . We have measured the cost , wouldn 't you say ? Don 't look , Or am I wide of the mark ? No . Don 't let her rule you . Shut up ... Block her out of you . Lock her out . It 's hard . - Put it on your head . The things she showed me . The other .. - The other place ? It 's in my head now , though . I can 't just rub it out . Can 't or won 't ? Shut up ! Shut up ! Self-control is all that is required ... for Six 's sake . Still come here ? What do you want from me , Six ? To kill someone you love because you love them , the village does that to you . Don 't you have to wonder what kinda place it is ? I know you don 't want to yet ... The time is coming ... when you wanna tell me ... To give me the information ... to get us all outta here ... To get you outta here . Does your mother care for you , Six ? Mine does . I believe she does . Only a mother can destroy every ounce of hope in ya . So , what are you gonna do ? You just gonna let them do this you ? Listen to me . I met someone who might be able to help you . Now this guy , this guy is deep . This guy 's got cures . Hey ! 147 . I make it ten till , which gives us 24 minutes to get across to Mr. Curtis and we don 't wanna be late . People usually like to be early for Mr. Curtis . Hey , you like to ride ? 'cause I like to ride . Man , time was , I was so crazy I thought every single car on the street was out to get me and I just had to get ' em first . Now I just wanted to hurt somebody . And now ? - Now ? Now , I 'm a baby . Now I 'm seeing the world through fresh eyes . It 's like my brain has had a wash . Like , a spring clean of the frontal lobe . You know what I mean ? What is this ? Something 's coming . Do you feel it ? And all we have to do is wait . No , can 't you see that 's crazy ? Waiting is giving up . They keep us here to control our minds up there . You were there now driving a car , right now , driving me . Man ! I mean , look at this - it 's my little girl . I mean , this is an old one but , uh , ain 't she something ? Huh ? And Mr. Curtis has had a word with the judge and he says if I keep making progress , they gonna let me see her again . Mr. Curtis ain 't nothing but a kind man . He 's a great man . No , that 's the most insanest thing I 've ever heard . We gotta get ourselves outta here , come on ! Right now , you 're dying and everyone knows dead men don 't have no hope . What does this great man want with me ? I 'm just a driver , man . I don 't know his plans . But I will tell you this : he will have some kind of plan for ya . I 'll be seeing you . Been celebrating , 11-12 ? I 'm not 11-12 . I 'm only Two 's son . That 's all I 'll ever be to anybody . 313 told me about the pills . Is your mother dying ? I thought .. one day ... maybe one day , she would come back . One day . Come with us . Leave . Leave your father Leave all of this ! The village is best for me . I live here . This place is all I 've got . Besides , I got stuff to do , only I 'm not nearly drunk enough , yet . I 'd like to get on with finishing the job . I think - think , that 's for me , everyone . I live here .. this place is all I 've got . All I 've got . I-I ... because I live here ... this place , it 's ... it 's all I 've got . I don 't think so . Hi , how are you ? Dear , look , it 's Michael ... from Summakor . My wife , Helen . Helen is biochemist . She studies the mind , the depths of the mind . We all commonly accept the existence of the unconscious . Helen surmised that if there are two layers of consciousness , then why not more ? And if there are more , where are they and what are they ? What if we could go there ? And what if we could take with us all these broken people and let them fix themselves . Nothing too clever , just the simple virtues in life .. Dignitive labor , civic pride , family , Sufficient to rekindle their lost purpose back on terra firma . Your driver ... he was one of these people . Well , yes .. there are hundreds more like him . Michael , you found them . Your work in Summakor . Spying on people . No . Protecting them . Repairing them . We all need that . Helen was the first person ever in the village . All those remarkable dreams . Everything thought , every impulse within the village resides here in her mind . No children of our own , her great heartbreak . And we thought , we wondered , if it were possible if we went there , that we could have a family . What goes in that head ? Of course , this was not the plan . Soon ... Not long now . He 's here . Look at the clock of the time . Small ... or large ? Oh , I shall miss you . Rest assured you will not go quietly . Horse drawn carriage , and the village choir serenading you to your final resting place . No excuse for dry eyes , I 'll see to that . And preferred hymns ? * When your heart begins to fail * * And your enemies avail * * Take you 're burden to the lord * * And leave it there * Mmm ? I will die at the right time ? Yes , of course , you will . Oh , it hurts , doesn 't it ? But once the lid closes on that fine glass coffin , the dance ends . There 'll be no escape , Six . Not for you ! 11-12 . 11-12 ! 11-12 ! * Leave it there , leave it there * * Leave it there * Don 't look at me ! Shut up ! * Leave it there , leave it there * Go . * Leave it there * leave it ! * Take your burdens to the lord * * And leave it there * To lose a child .. there is nothing else like that . Sir , if I 'm allowed to say ... I 'm sorry about 11-12 . Yes , you are allowed because you know how it feels . Can I ask you , is what you feel evil ? I want it to stop ! I want it all to stop , The madness of this world to stop . Most days ... I don 't know why I live . I don 't know why I breathe . I go on , I drive , I wait and I wait for this black pit feeling in my guts to go away , but it don 't . No , it grows , sir , That 's what ! What if ... what we feel , what 's happened to us , is for a purpose ? My son 's death .. I can only bear it if it gives me clarity . I had a dream last night .. A-a dream ? I dreamed clarity . All of it . Suppose your child 's death gives you a place in village history .. Gave you , 147 , the moral courage to act when the moment comes . To think what is unthinkable to do .. what can be done . You like Six , don 't you ? Trust him ? Yes , he 's someone who can give us better village , moral village , freedom within the prison , and when the moment comes , you will stand beside Six and you will call out that " Six is the one . " " The one ? " " The one . " Look , over there . Dark suit , gray hair , do you see ? Sure . - Well , that man , the things he 's seen . He was an army veteran , stationed out of the middle east , who blew up a village school . Now look at him . New wife , new life , new suit . What a difference . See that woman ? She was ruined by one street drug after another , and look at her now . Let me tell you , that woman . I see I 'm wasting my breath . Nobody signed up for this . None of these people asked to be fixed . You mean , we should seek their permission ? I 'm human . I have a thousand flaws . I break down , I get up . I don 't get up . I get lost . I make the same mistakes over and over . I have scars and wounds . Sometimes when I can 't bare them anymore , I-I drink . You can 't fix me . You can 't any of us . You can 't make us perfect . But I 'm not like them , am I ? You were keeping me quiet , because nobody resigns from Summakor . Not on your watch , huh ? Am I right ? You just listen to yourself , your integrity , your vision . We threw at you everything we had : love , loathing , death itself , and still you resist . Well , now I see you are not the problem , Michael . You 're a challenge , but an asset , an opportunity .. to take us forward . Oh , yes- - we 're here . Michael , come back to us , mmm ? You want him to live ? Yes . At any cost ? I want him to live . I can give you that . That 's why I wanted you to watch him here .. to see him . You must answer a question honestly . My son ... am I the reason ? Yes . Thank you . There 's something thrilling about honesty , don 't you think ? To face yourself . The inside Two . Six was right , I 'll admit it . Death was not enough to crack Six open , but he was wrong . Village death was not my last throw . I have the perfect means of assimilation for him . I know Six better than Six knows Six . He 's in love with his own humanity . He adores the sweet smell of his own bright shining conscience . Noble Six . He only wants to do the right thing and that is what will give him to me . That ... and you . Me ? You want Six to live ... Then I can give you your part in his fate . When the moment comes , you will know , and you will choose to give yourself to Six . Is that what you want ? Yes . It 's what I want . Your time 's almost at an end . If that is what you choose . Let me out of here . I see no locked doors . The village is in all of us , Six . I know you .. you want the village in you . No ... I 'm a free man . More than anyone here , you love the village . No , I have to escape . Every breath , every thought , I have is to get away . Then why do you conjure up this ? To keep you in . No ... It 's not true . I couldn 't . Look , Six . Look up ! Look ! Look at your fear .. see what you create with it . I w-won 't believe you . I won 't believe- - I will not do it ! Don 't .. Let me go ! I have no power over you . I never did have , you know that , Six . If you truly want to go , you must find the open door , rather than the beast that keeps you here . So which is to be , Six ? The door or the beast ? Which does Six choose to see ? * Leave it there * * Oh leave it there * * Take your burden to the lord and leave it there * * If you trust and never doubt * * He will surely bring you out * * Take your burden to the lord and leave it there * They have to get out . There are holes everywhere . You have to let them out . This isn 't about escape . Oh ? It 's about survival . How you feeling , Six ? The fever 's gone . * Leave it there * * Leave it there * * Take your burden to the lord * * And leave it there * * If you trust and never doubt * * He will surely bring you out * * Take your burden to the lord and leave it there * 11-12 chose .. He chose to kill himself , because he felt he was a prisoner here ... And so he was . Six here .. he 's told you the truth a thousand times . You are all prisoners ! Don 't look at me ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut-shut-shut .. What is this ? Shut up ! Everything has a price . The price of free-will , Michael . I said , " don 't look at me ! " Don 't look at me . What is she doing ? One never quite knows with Sarah . Knock-knock . Knock-knock . Must be a dozen tales like hers in every parish . It 's the experience of trauma as a child . How terrible , so unspeakable . " Put it on your head . " Noooo ! She 's quite out of reach . Nobody can help her . Shut up , shut up ! Shut up ! I tried so hard with Sarah , and for a time , she prospered , but lately , she 's begun to resist the village and this is what she 's condemned to : This prison . How do stop them ? How do we shut the holes ? You have to help . How do we close the holes , I wish I knew . But I-I can do nothing , and soon , we will face the same abyss . I can hear her . It 's how life begins , crying out . I can see her , blindly groping through the dark . Sh ... If only there were some way back ... But we can do , my friends , is breathe in , breathe out ... More .. village . Breathe in .. with me , breathe out . Come on ! More .. village . I hate you ! Breathe out . More .. village . There must be something .. you can do . Not now , not anymore . Sarah . I said , " don 't look at me . " Unless .. Ask him ! Six is the one . Six . Six is the one . We want Six . Six is the one . We want Six . One word from you .. Help me . Help me fix these people , Michael . You are the one . Six is the one . We want Six . Six is the one .. We want Six . Six is the one .. We want Six . Six is the one we 've been waiting for . Six will save us all . Six will save all of us . What are you doing ? In your left-hand pocket . Six is the one .. We want Six . There 's only one way to close the holes . We must find a dreamer . Pity Six , poor little Six . One word . No . Please . Let me . I want to . I know what I 'm doing . For you . For all this , till you find a better way . Go on . Sarah . 313 . Too late . Two little pills , the yellow one for you and another for me . Time to wake up now . Six , I give you the village . It 's called " New York . " The manufactured .. Who are you ? How do I get in ? If I open my mind .. Something 's wrong here . I keep trying to prove I 'm right . I think we found something . It 's the village . I think it would help me to tell you , it got away . They 're meddling with my mind . Ordinary people .. " Be seeing you . " Nothing 's real .. What .. You think I 'm insane ? What is this place ? I am not a number , I 'm a free man ! I want to get back to New York . I need you to help me in some other life . Helen ! Helen ! Helen ? Home . Home . At last . You look ... You flatterer ! Been making wraps . See , some things never change . Oh , come here . Curtis .. Shh ... Don 't look back . * I know so many people * * Who think can do it alone * * They isolate their heads * * And stay in their safety zone * There are people here , good people , whatever they 've lost . Funny , isn 't it ? It took me all this time to see how beautiful it is . What if .. Oh ! It has to be possible to do this the right way . Yeah ? Make a good village . I think I could do it . I think we have to try . Whatever the cost . * Now how can I come on * * And tell them the way that they live * * Could be better * * I know there 's an answer * * I know now but I have to find it by myself *

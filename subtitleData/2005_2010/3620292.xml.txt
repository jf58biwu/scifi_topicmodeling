 If I pay close attention ... I can feel outer space pulling at us . One way to fight the pull of the vacuum ... is to create your own . The chaos deepens in coastal areas worldwide . Flooding along coastal Florida , California , China , Taiwan , Japan and Southeast Asia has submerged entire cities . Displaced refugees numbers in the tens of thousands . Activists crowded the streets near UN headquarters today as major industrialized nations meet for the fourth time to discuss global warming initiatives . Again , one of the few countries not participating is the United States , consistent with the current administration 's refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol . This is the Diablo Valley Authority with bulletins for your area . We 're issuing an air quality alert for Thursday and Friday , so remember to wear protective masks when exercising outside . If you need a new one go to your nearest gas station , police station , or library . Replacement masks are six dollars . The worst isn 't over yet so remember to keep conserving gas and potable water to help out our friends on the coast . Conserve hard , stay safe , neighbors , and don 't forget to watch for the solar eclipse today at 1 : 45 ... Emergencies only . Buy yourself a pizza pocket , OK ? He will wipe away every tear from their eyes . And death will be no more , nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore , for the former things have passed away . There are armed conflicts in the Balkans , Iraq , Korea , Russia , Mexico , Colombia , Israel , and Peru . Can anyone tell me one thing that happened in the world today ? Jenny ? The mayor was caught drunk driving . I had a fight with my mom . I tripped her . All right , settle . Sources from Chinese Central Space say female astronaut , Xian Wei Ming , stationed on the recently launched Chinese space telescope , has been reporting sights of asymmetrical swelling and solar flaring from her sun observations . Several hours after Central Space authorities refused to confirm Xian 's observations , Xian reportedly changed trajectory of her spacecraft to a direct path to meet with the sun and expended all remaining fuels to break earth 's orbit . Earlier today , a 12 year-old Palestinian girl was run down by an Israeli tank at Hebron ... Yes . There was an eclipse . I know sweetie , but it 's not an emergency . You didn 't look at it , did you ? - No . - ' Cuz you 'll go blind . Bye . Your Mom lets you walk home alone ? Hi , Wendell . You want a ride back ? Off work already ? Yeah , they let me go home early . So , umm ... How are things between you and Scott ? Dude , quiet down . Oh , come on . He 's a good kid . Aren 't you , Tim ? Yup . Hey ! You 're home early . Yeah . I need a nap . You 're going out ? What do you want to be one day ? I don 't know ... Sorry you 're just dating a dumb jock who only wants to go whitewater rafting . He 's been practicing baptisms with his dad all day . Scott ! Pam 's here . Do you want some lunch ? What took you so long ? You need to quit smoking . You need a double-headed dragon dildo . I did quit . I can smell it on your clothes . I quit two hours ago . Diablo Valley Animal Control has issued a warning for all residents to keep their pets inside . And in Fresno today , Centron employee , Roderick Kent , shot and dismembered his wife and two children , then severed his own head with a chainsaw . Kent had just been maimed ... Sorry - just been named Centron Employee of the Month for his efforts ... Folks are saying these incidents are omens . Any little thing and it 's a sign the world 's gonna end . Totally paranoid , huh ? We 've been killing each other off since day one . We don 't stop because we don 't want to . Everyone keeps working , going to the gym , going to ball games . How could the world end ? Some people think the sun will swell up into a red giant and burn up all the planets . And some people expect a sort of Antichrist , who comes along pretending to be all nice , and making everyone believe in him . Then he tries to corrupt people so they won 't get into heaven . But eventually he 's overthrown by God in a rain of comets and good triumphs over evil , et cetera , et cetera . Silly . Ow . You just imagine it 's not there , as if it never happened . Like turning back time . Look at it ... and say hello . Hello . OK . Now close your eyes , concentrate ... and say goodbye . Bye . Own it . Bye . Yeah , well . Never worked for me either . Drink your juice , OK ? Bye . So what 's new , college boy ? I had sex for the first time . With that Jonah guy ? No ... Me and my goldfish . Of course , me and that Jonah guy . That 's really great . That 's really cool . We had sex sex . Mm hmm ... Anal sex . - Yeah , I know . - OK . I figured . I didn 't know if you knew . I don 't know what else you guys would be having . So how was it ? Incredible . I don 't know . I may really be in love this time . It didn 't hurt ? No . Well ... Yeah , it did initially , but then that kind of fed into the pleasure / pain thing . You just have to use a lot of lube . Dinner time . Let 's not leave . I have to . Anyway , you really should try it some time - anal sex . Call me ! We are very , very blessed , dear Lord , to have this wonderful , wonderful family . So for that we thank you , and for the food you placed in front of us , prepared by my lovely wife , which we eat in your name , O Lord . - Amen . - Amen . I like to have sex with men . Did you hear what I said ? Should anyone be blamed for becoming bored ? Yeah . He 's black . We really should make more black friends . And his name is Jonah . Maybe another outreach meeting . It is so hard to get blacks to come into our church . It isn 't hard to find one to come inside me . Boredom leads to restlessness , restlessness to recklessness . And recklessness puts all of us in harm 's way . I read in U.S. News and World Report that the anus is chockfull with ecoli bacteria . We used a condom . Condoms provide excellent protection against diseases . We should put one over our house . Richard , didn 't you mention a Jonah in your sermon last month ? He was swallowed by a whale . A very large fish . You should try it sometime - anal sex . Heart . My heart is broken . Heart . Scissors . Put down the scissors . Scissors . Genocide . Avoid genocide . Did you study for this ? No . Why not ? I don 't know . I 'm going to call your mom , OK ? She 's not home until 7 o 'clock sometimes . What about your dad ? He 's not with us anymore . When did he pass away ? He just said bye . He 's not really dead . It 's only three weeks after I turn 18 that Timothy Wu files his last official flight plan and takes off west into the sun . For a year we wondered where he went . Now we don 't care what happens to him . Last night a 67-year-old fisherman dumped 40 tons of toxic waste into Catalina Bay . Arresting officers mention he was speaking incoherently about killing off the jellyfish that in recent years have choked what was once a vibrant fishing industry . This one of a string of desperate acts we 've seen in depressed fishing communities which have dwindled as the population of jellyfish has exploded as a result of rising sea temperatures . Exhale , inhale . One more time for me . Inhale , exhale . Oh , shit ! Officer , haven 't you ever been distracted ? No , ma 'am . Bullshit ! I just think Timothy needs a more stable home environment to foster his growth potential . Why don 't you just bring some fucking dinner over then ? Well ... Kids need food to grow too , Mr. Robertson . I 'm just trying ... I really need some alone time or I will literally die . Don 't talk to your teachers about our personal life , OK ? Take Timmy with you to work tonight . Take him to work ? It 's just one night ... Please . I can watch him . I need you to watch me . But who cares about what I need . Mom , it 's not that I don 't care . It 's just that if I take Tim to work they 're gonna be pissed off if I show up with ... How long does it take to mop a hangar ? It 's not like you 're going to school to do something with your life ... Nobody wants what 's good for them at the right time . You miss your moment , and you find yourself ... stuck with ... Fine , I 'll take him . If we stress you out so bad why 'd you even have us ? Well , Pam ... Your father ... - Well , don 't just stare at it ! Relax . Mom ! Sorry ... Just clean it up . That 's really loud . Please stop . Why ? Because ... It 's loud . Tim ! Don 't make me come up there . What did you say ? Dad said it ... " Don 't make me come up there " . Do you miss him ? Should I tell you it wasn 't your fault ? 'Cuz it wasn 't . I didn 't know you washed airplanes . Well ... they get dirty . Whose fault is it ? Do you believe in heaven ? Yes . Dad did too . I don 't know ... I guess he was just ready for something new . Do you like Wendell ? He 's funny . Funny like a clown ? Funny like the President . I like that one . Only for a second , OK ? Romeo Delta ... Timmy , Oakland center . Go ahead . Pammy , 628 Romeo Delta ... Experiencing heavy turbulence , requesting niner point five . Sorry ... Remain in current altitude due to traffic . Dammit ! Oh , no , a bird ! Aaaaaahhhhhh ! What I 'm saying is that while , yes , you did draw very nice cotton fields , you also could diversify your subject matter ? Like maybe draw a boat . Or an Underground Railroad ? Or just a railroad . That 's pretty . Good . What 's that supposed to be anyway ? A waterfall . Looks like a cool alternate reality . You know what I mean ? OK . Sorry to mess things up at home for you . It 's all good . Do you want to come over on Saturday ? We 're having a barbecue . Cool . Are you sure your mom ... She said to invite two guests . Oh , we gotta get this . Yeah , we need salsa too . Mild or hot ? Hot . Speaking of hot , you look good today . What ? Come on . Are you seriously one of those people who can 't accept a compliment without accusing someone of sexual harassment ? No . I just don 't like being compared to a condiment . Oh ... Well . Where did you find that ? That 's a project your daddy and I started when Pam was really young . We were all addicted to sunsets . We even took some from your dad 's plane . I thought he took this with him . Your mom really cares about you , you know ? She never once regretted having you instead of finishing med school . You ever thought about tracking down your dad ? You have us all figured out . No , I don 't . But I do want to help . It 's blank . Timothy and I were talking ... I got the impression you needed flying lessons . Flying 's for prick-waxing jerk-offs . No need to be redundant . Stop ! Shit ... Sorry . No stars to guide us . Another marine creature , armed with a mass of stinging cells , can be found sailing the warm oceans of the world ... Zay ... jee . Zayyyy ... jee . Zai-Jian . Zai-Jian - Later , alligator ... Your dad could 've taught you more ... If he wasn 't such a space case . The bluebottle jelly , or Portuguese Man O ' War , is actually a symbiotic colony of four specialized animals . One polyp fills up with gas to become afloat , enabling the bluebottles to stay close to the surface for feeding . During the capture the chamber will shift in buoyancy to accommodate the weight of large prey ... ~ # XX I 'm a whale ! My project explores the relentless relationship between the body and the self . What do our bodies ask of us ? Who are we without our bodies ? Are these shells here to keep us separate from one another eternally ? So , yeah , my installments explore these ideas by consolidating flint , barbed wire and live turkeys . Oh , that 's really quite typical ... topical . Isn 't it ? Totally . That 's amazing . Off to the loo . Down the hall . So , Jonah , I had no idea you were Timothy 's teacher and Scott 's ... Small world , huh ? Can I get you anything ? Ro - Sham - Bo ! Ro - Sham - Bo ! That 's stupid . Bombs are for psychos . - Shut up ! - No ! Pacifier . You mean pacifist . Pacifist . Why must people focus on the darkness in the world ... when all most people want to do is achieve some kind of ... some kind of peace ? So ... Wendell is , um ... Thank you . Yes , he 's quite a catch ! He 's a little ... Well , is he a student ? No . He 's an assistant manager at Sports Lodge . Great ! Isn 't it amazing when people see your inner beauty ? It floors me every time ! Swarms of Cessnas every day , since they grounded all the big planes . So how long have you and Saura been going at it ? Let me say that a little differently ... About five weeks . Hmm ... not too long ! So , is Timothy doing OK ? He 's sophisticated for his age group . He just doesn 't seem to study at home a lot . Yeah , well ... Mom 's real busy , you know . Oh , I know . Skippy put up a good fight though , more than most collies would . In the end it 's really just your own self-interest that 's keeping them alive . I 'm just saying college is actually a great way to make new connections . I truly think connectivity is the only surefire way to a decent career - or lifestyle , for that matter . I mean , a solid network of connectivity ... Well , what 's the point ? I mean everything is hell anyway , right ? It 's easy for you to say that . I mean in your life , you have so much freedom - the way you live . Millions of kids would die for the opportunity that you have . I just think that you 're taking it for granted because it is within your grasp . I mean just sitting here talking to you , you seem like a pretty smart girl . Well , millions of kids are dying for our opportunities . I just don 't think everything is hell . Jell-o , anyone ? Do you want Jell-o ? I don 't eat Jell-o . You dropped your chair . Pam is so pretty . She 's so wonderfully exotic . She 's so lucky . I wonder if she realizes it . We certainly don 't want her flying off any more roofs . She 's much better now . You told me about the 3.8 GPA . That 's great . Pity college is so expensive . Yeah , pity about your dog dying too . That must have been really ruffff . Do you know where the tofu dogs are ? Try the freezer . You seem agitated . I 'm wonderfully exotic . Anything I can do ? It 's OK . It 's all right . I just wanna disappear . You make me want to disappear . You 're wasting our power . For months after Dad flew off Mom had this recurring nightmare ... Again and again she 'd wake us up right before sunrise , saying that the sun had reached its half-life and had turned into a jellyfish that was devouring the ocean . Every creature in the sea knew they were doomed if they stayed in the water , but outside of it they 'd suffocate . Made so sick and sightless by their own terror ... many destroyed themselves in anguish . But even in their most futile of moments they seemed to sense something in us worth saving , and they wouldn 't take us with them ... even when we asked them to . Even when their stories scared us half to death ... they were beautiful to me . When she met Wendell ... her stories stopped . She didn 't have to dream anymore . 400 thousand activists and area residents gathered in Slovenia today to celebrate the demolition of the last existing nuclear power plant on the European continent . Demands for environmental action from ordinary American citizens continues to grow , however , as politicians and celebrities continue to sound the call ... Don 't watch this . Don 't look . Scott and Mr. Robertson were holding hands . Well , that 's fine , but they 're gonna go through some hard times . How come ? Because ... they like hanging with boys more than they like girls . I like boys more than girls . That 's different , sweetness . What do you think about on your good days ? You know , your daydreams ? I just want peace , you know . There are things I haven 't told you about ... that I 'll tell you some time . I really fucked up . What ? I kissed him . You serious ? Yup . Why ? 'Cuz I 'm a fuck-up . I guess I should go ... I 'm fucking sad right now . So ? I 'm depressed . You 're the only clear ... exciting thing in my life , basically . I just feel like everyone else is corrupt . I hope it 's not anyone we know . You can 't fight me ! I 'm Jesus ! Yeah , well , I 'm God ! I 'm your Dad ! You look depressed . Did I do something wrong ? No . Good . What ? Does he make you feel special ? He stands up for you when I complain . You complain about me too ? Mom ! I 'm happy , OK ? OK ... Then I 'm happy too . Yeah ? Sorry all about the weird stuff at the barbecue . Sometimes adults just do weird things ... Things that we don 't mean . We 're very immature . You 're not an adult . It 's one month before he realizes he 's bored of us when Dad insists on reading me to bed ... which he hasn 't done since I was 6 . 'We can start working with time if you wish , ' Chiang said , 'Till you can fly into the past and the future . And then you will be ready ' . The day that Chiang vanished his feathers went brighter and brighter and at last turned so brilliant that no gull could look upon him . As the days went past , Jonathan found himself thinking time and again of the earth from which he had come . If he had known there - just a tenth ... just a hundredth - of what he knew here , how much more life would have meant . It 's nice . When did you say that your parents are coming home ? Monday . They went on a retreat , some church retreat . Excuse me ... We 're home . - Oh , my gosh ! - Hi , Mom . When you 're done I 'd like a word . Your parents called the schoolboard , Scott . There 's been a lot of complaints . They 're recommending a transfer . It 's no one 's fault , : It 's just the situation . OK , everyone , I 'm Miss Gatzert . Mr. Robertson came down with the flu that 's going around , and he left a spelling list for Friday . I 'd like you all to take out your World History books . Have we covered The Crusades yet ? What are you looking at ? Are you a homo like Mr. Robertson ? It 's kind of hard to put into words what makes you fall in love with someone . It 's indescribable . Here you go , Scout . There has to be an event . It 's an event that marks a change in you ... Like a nova . A nova is when a star becomes unstable . So it 's like inside you 've become a hundred times bigger . And no one can see it , but everyone knows . How 's your sister ? Fine . Have you seen her and Scott kiss ? No ? Have you seen her taking a bath ? I think she must be beautiful . Explode ... X ~ P ~ L ~ O ~ D ~ E. Explode . Silver ... S ~ L ~ I ~ V ~ E ~ R ... Silver . Four Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed Thursday in the West Bank in Gaza . A 12-year old Palestinian girl was crushed by a tank at Hebron ... I feel sick . Was it me ? No . Did Wendell say something ? Not really . Are you lying ? He was just talking weird . Weird like how ? Like when you 're eating and you 're crying , and it doesn 't taste good . I know ... I hate that . So , Jonah called . It looks like the school board sided with you guys . I think it 's time that we reassess things . Reassess what ? My rectum ? You know , when I was very young I thought I could find meaning by using my time on this earth to make up for having more than others . I failed at everything I tried . We still rage , kill , starve . There 's only so much you can do . At a certain point , the futility begins to eat into you . At a certain point you have to abandon control . You have to leave the rest to God . I think ... you think ... the mere act of thinking ... is your God . I do everything for you out of love ... There is no God . Don 't you ever ... Don 't you ever speak to him again . If you don 't get the fuck out of our house ... I 'll fucking kill you ! Hey ... Stop , stop , stop . You 're sick ! You erase me and you fill me up at the same time . I don 't know what to do about it . I need your help to figure it out , OK ? Shoot , dammit . I 'm almost home , Tim . Hi . It 's Saura . I can 't take your call right now , so leave a message . I need you to help me , Pam . I need you to ... be an adult with me . Grow up and help me , Pam . You know how to get everything you want with your stupid smile . So do you . Get off ! Just let go . You need to talk to your daughter . Mom , he 's been asking Tim sick questions about me . I just can 't handle it . I can 't ! Oh , my God . He raped me . Are you kidding me ? He raped me . Tim was here the whole time . He knows . Oh , my God ! Did he ? Did he rape her ? No . He doesn 't even understand what you 're saying ! Where are we going ? Away from this stupid place . Turn fuckin ' green ! It 's cold ! Go to the car and turn the heater on . Fuck . You see anything ? Not yet . I 've been meaning to give those to you in support of your cocksucking relationship . You 're special . I 'm not afraid of the world ending when we hang out . Do you think we 'll be together , hanging , when it all happens ? We 'll probably be long dead before it happens . You never know ... We could go at any second ... Now . Or ... now . Or ... now . I think we 'll be together . If it wasn 't Jonah ... it would be me , right ? I don 't want to lie to you . Lie to me . No . Yeah . Just kidding . You two lived around here long ? Yes . It 's a very safe place to live , especially if you have kids . Everybody is so good to each other around here . Looks like we 're trapped . Is this right ? I think so . I think it would be wise ... to stop for the night . I 'll call a truck . I have nothing witty to say . Say something nice . This is so stupid . Are you all right , honey ? Yes , I 'm all right . Are you hurt ? Oh , I 'm fine . I think we should get home . Help me , Pam . Be an adult with me ... Grow up and help me , Pam . It 's not as bad as I thought . This whole experience has just reminded me of something . Did you remember to send in our auto premium ? I can 't keep my brother out here like this . I 'm gonna stay with my parents down south . Maybe apply to grad school . If you leave , they win . What about me ? What about you ? Zai-Jian . Love you . I figured it out , you know ... Why mom had Tim so late . She was willing to do anything to make him stay . Didn 't work . I 'm gonna not love you , OK ? I 'm gonna not be so stupid anymore . Be an adult with me . Grow up and help me , Pam . When you jumped off the roof you weren 't trying to die , right ? 'Cuz Mom said you were trying to die . Well , I wasn 't . You were trying to chase Daddy 's plane . Open . So you 're telling me that she faked the whole thing ? Is that what I 'm supposed to think ? You know that 's not what I meant . I 'll go get my stuff . Wait . What ? Let 's have a drink . My Mom said to me , " I think we should reassess the situation . " I said , " Reassess what ? My rectum ? " This is good . Now they can 't just sweep it under the rug . It 's like it was meant to be or something . I don 't know . I feel so close to you now . Did you set this up ? What up ? Did you know your parents would find us ? Yeah . You know we 're through , right ? Scott ? Oh , my God ! He 's all right ! Where were you ? Pam . Weather experts say the showers should be spectacular . Sky watchers can expect to see dozens of meteors per hour . A meteor shower can sometimes be the brightest object in the sky , wandering through space , rogue debris left behind by a timeless comet . The next heavenly display isn 't anticipated until next December . So don 't miss out on this one , folks . Tim ! - Eat . - Hmm ? Eat . Hey ... I 'm sorry . Aren 't you gonna drink your juice , buddy ? No . Did your crazy sister brainwash you ? Are you attracted to stupid people ? Because I 'm pretty stupid . It 's all right . No ! Calm down . Please . Get off of her ! Get off ! Mom ! What are you ... Mom ! Help me ! I 'm not going to hurt you . I 'm just gonna hold you here so you can 't hurt me . OK ? Leave her alone ! Your daughter wants me dead . You think it 's dark in here , but it 's not . The saddest thing I 've ever seen is a nice woman growing old alone . Pam 's not gonna be there . I hate you . Actually it 's kind of pathetic . Shoot , did I scare you ? Friends , right ? I could use more friends . Couldn 't you ? Mom ! Stop ! Say it , OK ? Friends ? Say it . Say it . Zai-Jian . Scientists had initially discounted reports of solar anomalies made by Chinese astronaut Xian Wei Ming one month ago , but astronomers around the world are now confirming that solar flares did indeed occur last week beginning at 8 a. m . PST on Tuesday . A few hours later , a wave of accelerated protons hit the Chinese Space station , with all likelihood destroying the bulkhead and killing Xian . Flaring continued with sporadic but extreme solar winds and geomagnetic storms in earth 's magnetosphere . How 's the peach ? Good . Pam ? Hmm ? I think it 's coming back . That 's never happened before . Did you do that ?

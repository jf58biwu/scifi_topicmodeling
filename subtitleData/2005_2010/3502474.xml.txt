 There are nearly seven billion people on this planet . [ gunshot ] Each one , unique , different . What are the chances of that ? And why ? Is it simply biology ? Physiology that determines this diversity ? A collection of thoughts , memories ? Experiences that carve out our own special place ? Or is it something more than this ? Perhaps there 's a master plan that drives the randomness of creation . Something unknowable that dwells in the soul , and presents each one of us with a unique set of challenges that will help us discover who we really are . [ gasps ] You okay ? Did you have a dream ? It 's Nathan . - What about him ? - He 's- - He 's what ? In trouble . He 's not the only one . What is it , Noah ? That construction work we passed about a mile back wasn 't real . There 's going to be a road block a half a mile or so ahead . This is where you get out . Okay ... Head two miles in that direction , and then follow the surface streets into the city . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to buy you some time . Here . It 's a secure line . I will find you . Get to Nathan and make sure it is him . He 'll be on Sylar 's trail , by now . - But Dad , I- - - Listen to your father . I love you , Claire bear . [ Claire and Noah sighs ] Okay . [ police radio ] Is there a problem , Officer ? What are you doing ? I told you , I need you to be Taub . I 'm not interested in what you need . I 'm- - [ gasps ] Such a waste . You could 've been so helpful . Just didn 't know your place . Eddie and Gordon , send a clean up crew to- - [ slow , deliberate breathing ] That hurt . Shape-shifting ... Gotta love it , right ? Ah ! The changes don 't just happen on the outside , either . You remember that little , uh ... off-switch in the back of my head ? I moved it . [ nervous breath ] Go ahead , get it over with . My men will be here any second - to collect Petrelli . - Shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh , shh , shh . I know . I got plans for them . Hell ... I have plans for all of us . You going to kill him ? Later . Right after I absorb all of his memories . It 's a little ability Angela Petrelli fed me like a snack . Because Nathan , and- - By Nathan , I mean , I- - Have a rendezvous with destiny tomorrow . The President 's giving a speech at the Stanton Hotel . Senator Petrelli 's going to be there to have a little meeting with him right afterwards . What for ? Nothing . Just to shake his hand . And when I do ... I 'm going to be the most powerful man in the world . You better kill me now . Because there 's no way I 'm going to let that happen . No , I don 't need to kill you . Because in 30 seconds , there 's not a person on this planet who 'll believe a word you say . [ metamorphosis noises ] [ officers muttering ] [ door opens ] [ gun clicks ] [ gunfire ] Man down ! Man down ! I 've got him . He 's in here . [ guns clicking ] You son of a bitch . [ ethereal music ] You think there 's a chance he didn 't get caught ? Noah ? No . That was his plan all along . I don 't know how my dad always manages to get himself in the middle of everything . Because he puts himself there . Mostly because of you . You have no idea the lengths a parent will go to ensure the safety of their child . Something I hope you never have to find out for yourself . Now ... This is where I get off . [ shoes squeak sharply ] What do you mean ? I just wanted to make sure you got here safely . I 'm not going in there with you to see Nathan . Why not ? Because I need to go find Matt Parkman . Is this about your dream ? In it , Parkman saves Nathan 's life . Okay , so why don 't you just come up and warn Nathan and tell him how to avoid danger ? That 's not how it works . I cannot change what I dreamed . But I can help push its outcome . Now ... You go find Nathan . And I will find you later . [ elevator bell rings ] Mmm . Nathan . [ kicks board ] Wake up . Hey . [ slapping ] Wake up . You want to be convincing when we meet the President today , right ? I 'm going to need all those sick , little , twisted memories of yours . [ slaps ] [ sighs ] Such a lightweight . To hell with it . Got plenty of memories from all this stuff you 've got lying around here , anyway . Your diploma says you graduated with honors from Annapolis ... These cufflinks tell me a different story . Politicians . Sir , someone here to see you . She claims to be your daughter ? All right ... Send her in . Claire . I 'm glad you finally made it . I was beginning to get worried about you . Did you find him ? Sylar ? Yeah . But he got away . He 's going to the Stanton Hotel to meet the President in an hour . I 'm going to intercept the President first and warn him . And tell him what ? That Nathan Petrelli is a look-a-like ? If I have to , yeah . Blow the lid off this whole thing . I 'm going to do whatever it takes to shut down Building 26 . And how do I know this is you ? What are you talking about ? How do I know you 're not Sylar ? Claire . I am me . We 've spent a lot of time together over the past few days . Mexico . I was beginning to think you knew me better than anyone else . [ sighs ] Sorry . [ chuckles ] It 's all right . Listen . Why don 't you stay here ? I 've got a car taking me to the Stanton Hotel . Lay low until I can clean this whole mess up . No , I want to come with you . In case anything goes wrong . It 's not going to be safe . So what ? I can 't get hurt . And I need to help stop Sylar . It 's time I put myself in the middle of this and made a difference . I was thinking exactly the same thing . You 're right . If things do go south ... I want you right there . Right by my side . [ backdoor opens ] Right out . - Come on . - Let 's go . [ backdoor closes ] This way . [ door opens ] [ door closes ] Fancy meeting you here . [ door opens and closes ] I bet you 're happy to see me . Sylar ... We 've got to stop him . Oh ! A lot of help you 're going to be . Okay , let 's hear it . Lecture . The finger-wagging , the general " I told you so . " That I screwed up . Refused to listen . And then you got into bed with Sylar . That 's all over now . Clearly . That 's very zen of you . No , it 's practical . If we get out of here , we 're going to have to throw everybody and everything we have at Sylar ... Trying to get a spike into the back of his head . [ Danko chuckles ] A spike 's not going to cut it anymore . He moved the spot . Great . How the hell did you do it ? Deal with all of this ? Can 't capture all of them , can 't contain them . There are no rules . Not even gravity . It 's all about spinning plates . Living in the Gray area . 20 years of middle management , becomes second nature . So in 20 years , I 'll get it ? 20 years and an adopted daughter . If I didn 't have Claire , I 'd be following the same dogma that took you right over the edge . I 'd be exactly in your position . You are exactly in my position . Yeah . We should do something about that . Together . [ sighs ] [ door opens ] [ door opens ] - Hiro . - Hmm ? [ door opens ] Holy crap ! [ metronome building up ] Hiro . Hiro ? Is this a trick ? I don 't know . No guards . Something 's very wrong here . Hiro . Let 's go . Hiro , what- - [ sighs ] What happened ? We are rescuing you . I 'll try to repay you later . But right now , we have to get out of here as soon as we can . Woah , are you okay ? No , he 's not . He has nosebleeds and headaches from stopping time . Oh , I 'm fine . You 're a doctor , right ? Then you can help him . Here , open your eyes wide . Your pupils are dilated . Do you have any stiffness in your left arm ? Or dizziness ? Yes . But Bruce Wayne only slept two hours a night . - Hiro ! - Hiro ... These abilities allow us to do superhuman things , but you are still human . And your human body is rejecting these powers , like , uh ... like a virus . But this power ... It is what makes me strong . My destiny . You can 't freeze time again . Do you understand ? [ detector noises ] Thanks . So what 's the plan ? We just tell them the President 's in danger ? That would just send them down a rabbit hole . And then Sylar can become ... a rabbit . So we got to play close to the vest . Follow my lead , okay ? Nathan ! It 's good to see you , man . This is my daughter , Claire . Claire , this is Liam . Samuels . The President 's Chief of Staff . I live in America . Your dad and I barely survived boarding school together . Barely . [ chuckles ] Listen , I really appreciate the President giving me some time this afternoon . Sure , he just stepped up onstage . Speech usually clocks in about 90 minutes . Whatever works for him . But I 'd like to stick around , close by . Absolutely . We got a suite upstairs . Come here . Uh , do me a favor . Sign in right here , and , uh , Frank will show you - how to get up there , all right ? - Okay . - Nice to meet you . - You , too . [ elevator bell rings ] I thought you were right-handed . Ambi-dextrous . I bat righty . Throw lefty . You coming ? [ guards muttering via walkie-talkie ] Prisoners are gone . The entire unit 's been captured . Seeing as how your unit was trying to kill us , I think we caught a break . How the hell did this happen ? I tried to tell you before this whole thing started . Your men alone are never going to be a match for people with abilities . You sure this will work ? Tasers didn 't work on Sylar , but one shot of this will put an elephant down . Trick is getting close enough to the elephant . [ dialing on phone ] Hiro . - Hiro ! - Call 911 . I 've got to get to the Stanton . I 've got to stop Sylar . Go , we 'll stay with him . [ phone ringing ] CLAIRE : Hello ? Thank God . Where are you ? I 'm with Nathan . Are you sure it 's him ? Oh , it 's him . Don 't worry . How do you know ? Because it 's me . [ phone clicks ] [ chuckling ] [ inhales ] [ sighs ] Oh , God . This is fun . [ bottle cork noises ] Don 't you love a good Pinot ? My dad 's on his way . He 's going to stop you . And then I 'm going to kill you . No . Actually , I 'm going to kill him . Or have you kill him . I haven 't decided yet . Don 't give me that look . Everybody dies sometime . Well ... Almost everybody . Papa Petrelli , Mama Bennet ... Mr. Muggles . What 's your brother 's name again ? Larry ? [ sighs ] Lyle . Lyle , right . Hmm , he 's going to die too . As we speak , my father 's dying . [ grunt ] Did I tell you I got to meet my real dad ? [ exhales ] Boy , was that a disappointment . Have you ever stopped to think about how much we have in common , Claire ? You were adopted . I was adopted . You ... can 't die . I can 't die . [ glasses clink ] Oh , you can die . I 'll make sure of it . [ chuckles ] Mm . [ long sniff ] Mm ! You 'll get bored . After like a 100 years of trying to off me , watching all of your loved ones drop like flies . You may eventually come to forgive me . Maybe you 'll even love me . I 'll keep trying to kill you . For the rest of my life . Well , everybody needs a hobby . [ gulps ] I mean , I 'm not saying there aren 't bridges that need to be built . But if we start building them now ... Who knows ? You could be my first First Lady . I 'm sorry , Senator . There 's a full lockdown . No one gets in or out without talking to Mr. Samuels . Then you better talk to Mr. Samuels . [ phone dialing ] I have Senator Nathan Petrelli requesting access to the building . Is there a problem ? He says you 're already inside . If you 're here , then who the hell 's up in that suite ? And I can either know now or after we 've taken him down . You 're not going to do that . Alright , you send your men up there , and they will die . He 's right . His name is Sylar . He 's extremely dangerous . And he 's a target ? He 's one of them ? He 's one of them . He 's- - Got to stop saying that . He 's one of us . He 's one of us . [ gun clicking ] It 's all right . Liam ... I 've been lying to the President . I 've been lying to myself . And I will take full responsibility for my crimes when the day comes . But today we 're going to course correct . There 's a man in that suite upstairs , and he needs to be stopped . And how do you suggest we do that ? You don 't . We do . Sylar can only be stopped by people like us . My brother can do whatever Sylar can do , we just have to get him close enough to touch him . Just give us a five-minute head start . That 's all I 'm asking . [ elevator bell rings ] I 'll take him high , you take him low . Let 's cut the son of a bitch in two . I love you , Pete . You know that ? Of course . I love you too , Nathan . Ready . [ door opens ] [ Claire moans ] [ shattering glass ] Go ! [ lightning sound ] [ door closes ] [ grunting ] [ lightning sounds ] [ crashes and thuds ] [ door opens ] [ door creaks ] [ grunting ] Are you all right ? - Yeah . - Where 'd they go ? The window . Can you fly after them ? I can 't . Come on , we have to find them . Come on ! [ grunting ] [ groaning ] [ piano breaks ] Ah ! Ah ! Ah . [ choking ] [ chuckling ] Oh , Claire 's going to be so mad at me . - Taxi . - Just get out right here . It 's about time . Mrs. Petrelli , what are you doing here ? - Waiting for you . - How did you find me ? I had a dream . Nathan 's in trouble . Something terrible happened to him . And then you save him . I don 't know how . All I know is you have to come with me . I can 't . I 'm sorry . My dreams don 't lie , Mr. Parkman . Now I need you to come with me . I came here to stop those agents from coming after us . I need to be able to go back to my boy , and know he can live his life without being hunted . I 'm sorry about Nathan . Then we want the same thing . And without Nathan , none of that is possible . You don 't have to read minds to know that . Come with me . We should separate here . You go that way , I 'll look for Nathan over here . Hold it . [ gun clicks ] Noah ? You tell me that 's Claire , not Sylar . I just fought Sylar , okay . That is Claire . - Put the gun down . - Dad ... It 's me . [ whispering ] Did you take his power ? Yeah . So we can stop him . Freeze ! On the ground ! The President 's life is in danger . You want him to live ? You need to listen to us . I said on the ground ! You can either listen to me now ... Or I 'll tell you after you shoot me . They were here , Peter and Nathan . I 'm sorry . Only authorized personnel beyond this point . This is a Secret Service badge . You 're going to let us through . Oh , sorry . You guys go ahead . You don 't want to see this . - No , no , I need to . - Mrs. Petrelli . - No , I need to ! - Mrs. Petrelli , don 't ! No , I need to ! - Nathan ! - Please . Nathan ! No . No ! No ! [ crying ] I don 't understand . My dream . You were supposed to save him . [ crying ] This way , Mr. President . Nathan . Is that you ? Of course it 's me . We 're getting the President out through the basement . I can 't give you any more time . That 's all right . You don 't have any more time to give . This way , Mr. President . [ knocking ] Thank God you 're all right , sir . The Secret Service did a hell of a job today . And so did you . [ gasps ] [ breathing loudly ] Bet you didn 't think I took that one from you . This is insane . This will never work . We 'll make it work . It 's the only way . And it has to be right now . I don 't know how much time I bought sending Peter and Claire after Nathan . Why don 't you just chain him up , huh ? Or tranq him . Isn 't that what you guys love to do ? I don 't want to be part of this . I thought you came back to protect your family , Matt . I did , but what you 're asking me to do is crazy ! Who will convince the President the whole thing was a mistake ? Without Nathan , nothing 's going to change . Word gets out ... that a person with abilities murdered a U.S. senator , you 're going to have a 100 Dankos out there . Even if I could do what your asking me to do , he would never really be Nathan . He 'd always be Sylar . If Sylar can absorb all of Nathan 's memories , then the entire history of anything he touches will fill in the gaps . Physically , no one will ever know the difference . It 'll be permanent . Look , the last thing in the world I want is to see that son of a bitch still alive , and I have to lie to my family about it . But we need Sylar to be Nathan Petrelli again . Matt ... You don 't do this ... Nathan is gone forever . And how do we explain what happened to him ? There 's a body in deep freeze in Building 26 . It 's identical . A shape shifter . Your son , Mr. Parkman- - You just wanted to protect him . Can you honestly tell me that if something happened to him , you wouldn 't do anything- - Anything to keep him in your life ? I can 't lose Nathan , not like this . I 'm begging you . You 're no longer Sylar . No longer Gabriel Gray . That life is over . Sylar 's dead . You 're no longer Sylar- - Sylar . You 're no longer ... Sylar . No longer Gabriel Gray . Your life is over . Sylar ... is dead . You 're now Nathan . Petrelli . Nathan Petrelli . Son . Brother . Father . Senator . Nathan . [ cheers and applause ] Petrelli . Ah ! [ snorting ] [ struggling , choking ] Ma ? We are all connected . Joined together by an invisible thread . Infinite in its potential , and fragile in its design . Yet while connected , we are also merely individuals . Empty vessels to be filled with infinite possibilities . An assortment of thoughts , beliefs . A collection of disjointed memories and experiences . It 's a new beginning , Mom . Can I be me without these ? Can you be you ? I take it the President agreed to it ? Funding , resources , deniability . I told them I found just the man to head up our new ... What were we going to call it ? I always liked " The Company . " I can 't believe he 's really dead . He 's really dead , Claire . He really is . And if this invisible thread that holds us together were to sever , to cease ... What then ? What would become of billions of lone , disconnected souls ? Therein lies the great quest of our lives . To find , to connect ... To hold on . For when our hearts are pure , and our thoughts in line , we are all truly one , capable of repairing our fragile world and creating a universe of infinite possibilities . You 're number four . [ door opens ] I haven 't heard from you in weeks . I was beginning to worry . Nathan . Sorry , Mom . Just haven 't felt like myself lately . Don 't be ridiculous . This is a great time for you , Nathan . The world 's your oyster . We put all that nonsense behind us . The family 's back together . This is your time . Now come on . We 're gonna be late for lunch . Nathan ... Have you heard a word I 've said ? [ clock ticking ] [ door opens and creaks ] It 's just this clock . It 's running a minute and a half fast . [ ticking ] So ... [ clears throat ] lunch ? Italian ? Or Chinese ?

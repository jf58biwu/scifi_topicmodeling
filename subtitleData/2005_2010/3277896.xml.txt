NEW AMSTERDAM Season 01 Episode 08 : " Love Hurts " So what now , Johann ? You were up all night . How about sleep ? I thought you were on a shift this morning . The hospital canceled . I 'm sleeping in . And so should you . Even miracles of modern science need rest . Surviving that shooting wasn 't a miracle . It just wasn 't my time . A bullet perforates your heart . And a week later , you 're completely recovered . That 's pretty miraculous . I 've seen you die twice now and come back to life . Oh , cops have nine lives . Not the cops I know . Maybe your cells are swimming in mgmt . Maybe all your stem cells are pluripotent , I don 't know . I just know I hate going to bed together and waking up alone . Yeah , I should have called . It 's like when you got shot . When I woke up , for a ment , I thought you were gone . Forever . I 'm here now . I have a cure for what ails you . My family has a house in montauk . And I have off a couple days off next week . I 'm kidnapping you . I 'm on a case . Nope . I talked to Eva . She said you 'd be on limited duty at most . Doctor knows best . She 's pretty ripe . The gases . You want menthol ? No . Love this stuff . 'Course I 'm doing twice as much nicotine as when I was smoking . But hey . My lungs are clear . What about hers ? We did a float test . Not a lot of water in the alveoli . She was dead before she hit the water . How ? Strangulation . Fractured hyoid bone . Someone had some powerful hands . The skin between the fingers is pulling away . A week in the water ? Depending on the temp , but that 's reasonable . This missing finger ? A predator ? Thanks , Mank , for the report . A desk jockey 's job is never done . Your partner thinks he can play me . Welcome to my world . You ok ? You look a little ... green . I 'm fine . Just peachy . Yeah ?

It wasn 't the smell . I 've got food poisoning . Let 's hit the vic 's apartment . I 'm not feeling so hot myself . I got irritable bowel syndrome . Why don 't I fill in ? - Gee , would you , John ? - Yeah . I 'll cover for you with Burnett . I mean , I 'd really appreciate that . What 'd you give him ? Knicks tickets ? Box of cohibas ? A free colonic ? It 's my fault . How so ? Martine didn 't return my calls . I should have known something was wrong . When was the last time you saw her ? A week ago . She was sort of living with this guy . Who ? Carl Browning . He 's a big money guy . Commodities broker . He lives on a yacht . And he 's , um ... What , Kayla ? I only met him once . But I didn 't like him . The way he ordered Martine around , treated her like a possession . I mean , I know he had a lot of money , but I didn 't understand what she saw in him . Did Martine have any family here ? She moved here from terre haute when she lost her folks . Was she an actress ? She was really talented . Noel coward . Private lives . I was there opening night . Not Martine 's production , another one . So what 's the play tonight ? The smack ? Too familiar . The tip ? Too risky . The huge duke ? Too complicated . The wipe ? The last turn ? The hot seat ? What 's the con ? Johnny . Come on . No time for romance . You 've got debts to retire . The tat . With a dame at the table ? Makes the grift better . Mr. Browning . NYPD . It 's about time . I called it in almost a week ago . Are you guys on the slow train ? You called it in ? What , is there an echo here ? I talked to a cop . He said they were going to send somebody over to collect evidence , but nothing happened . We just found the body , sir . Whose ? Martine Shane . Martine ? Isn 't that what you called about ? I called about a break-in . Martine 's dead ? But why didn 't you call the police when you didn 't hear from her ? You don 't know Martine . She 's--she was unpredictable . That 's what made it good with her . Did you fight ? Everybody fights . Did you ever hit her ? You think I killed her ? Talk to my lawyer . A ramsden sextant . - Much truer than the astrolabe . - Amsterdam . Navigational tool . We used it during the war ? Doubt it . That 's from the 1700s . It 's worth a fortune . Oh , I know . I was referring to the revolutionary war . Amsterdam , let 's go . Gps is a cheat , don 't you think ? For real sailors ? I use it all the time . Then it would have recorded where your boat was last week . Take Martine out a lot ? You mean did I throw her overboard , detective ? You 'll have to get a warrant to find out . Now get off my boat . And don 't mistake this for caring what you think . But I loved Martine . We were engaged . She was it . Here you go , Frances . Thank you . Good night . Miss . You 're very good at that game . It was my lucky night . Nonsense . Confidence games take skill . You are a con man , mr . Johnson , or whatever your name is ? A grifter . Look , miss , my wife 's in labor . You 're not married . You 're not the type . You think you 're the gnat 's whistle , don 't you . I don 't want any trouble , lady . What do you want ? I 'm an actress . I like someone 's who 's good at playing a role . You could use a few pointers , though . Well , maybe you could show them to me in person . Maybe I could . As for what I want ? Half your take will do . Ain 't you got no shame ? No . What if some kid walked , saw you in your particulars . He 'd get what he deserved for sneaking into a closed facility . That 's what you 're doing . I have a key . From 1935 . So , what you gog to do ? About what ? You know what . The doc . She came by the bar , looking for you . She 's a good woman , no doubt . But she didn 't do the trick . I don 't know that . You were dead and then you weren 't . Like it or not , you 're still immortal . Maybe we need to get married , formally , in the eyes of god . God don 't have nothing to do with this . I like being with her . Whether she " does the trick " or not . This ain 't like your other women . With them , you didn 't know for sure the one was out there . Now you do . Just because you look older , Omar , doesn 't mean you are . I can do without the advice . This ain 't fair to her , John . What are you going to do when you realize that the right girl was someone else on that subway platform ? You just going to dump Sara ? I told you . I don 't know she 's not it . You can keep playing that role with me if you like . But can you play it with her ? Doesn 't she deserve the truth ? I checked the dispatch system . Anonymous male caller reported a dispute on Browning 's boat last week . And the GPS records showed the boat was taken out on the day Martine disappeared . Sounds like a ground ball . Maybe . I hate baseball metaphors . Fyi , I told Burnett you 're at psychological counseling . Wishful thinking . Mr. Browning . You asked for a warrant ... coffee ? Get your own . Refreshments aren 't included . I mean , what you do . You broker coffee . I trade coffee futures . Not interested in the past ? The past is for suckers . I thought that tradition had passed . I 'm a sucker for tradition . Yeah ? Me , too . Come on in . I haven 't been in this building in years . Used to be you could have your meals sent up by dumbwaiter from the dining hall downstairs . That must have been a very long time ago . You must have been a baby . Martini ? You have your own stash ? My own private bootlegger . How do you take it ? Just look at the vermouth , don 't pour it . To actors . Whatever their profession . So what 's your moniker ? Confidence men always have a nickname , don 't they ? Johnny on the spot . I like that . That 's a good name . Smells like bleach . You 're not going to hurl again are you ? Maybe he used it to clean up the blood . You can 't cheat an honest man . You think that 's true ? You asking me ? I don 't know many honest men . We found this towel in the bathroom . Even odds , vic 's blood . You 're wasting your time . Guys are always working on the boat . One of them probably cut himself . We 'll soon find out . Don 't go too far , Mr. Browning . I think you can . What ? Con an honest man . If you 're good at it . There 's no magic . We use psychological profiles , in-depth questionnaires , an extensive database , and then we put people together who have similar wants and needs . That 's the problem . There 's no magic . You don 't believe in matchmaking ? Well , it 's a romantic shell game . Lonely men are easy marks . Excuse my partner . What he knows about relationships wouldn 't fill a thimble . Are you single , detective ? You might want to try out our service . Oh , please . Don 't waste your time . So what can you tell us about Martine and Carl Browning ? They met through you ? It 's a terrible tragedy . I still can 't believe it . Mr. Browning was a client . He met Martine at one of our events . They seemed happy . We 'd like to see their files . Unfortunately , I can 't do that . You can 't or you won 't ? In my business , confidentiality is everything . The people who seek us out are of a certain station and they depend on our discretion . We can go to court . We have psychologists on staff , so our clients are protected by doctor / patient privilege . That 's a stretch . As cops , we know a lot of reporters . We can choose to give them details of your involvement , or you can depend on our discretion . What do you want to know ? Let 's start with anybody else Martine went out with . We were so good together . We had like a binary thing . I don 't understand . The usual base 2 system is a positional notation with a radix of 2 . It 's how computers work . Zeros and ones . So what happened ? We crashed . You asked her to marry you ? Twice . I opened myself up and she laughed at me . That make you mad ? Well , we 'd been going out for three weeks . How would you feel ? I loved her , but I can 't believe she 's gone . I always thought we 'd end up together . She filed a restraining order against you . Says you stalked her for months . I needed to prove it to her . That you loved her . When you find the right person , you have no choice . You do what you need to do . All my songs are about that . It was never going to work . We had different interests . Have we met before ? I have one of those faces . Martine and I went out a few times , antique shows , that sort of thing . She was bored . There was no click . Benwaar . That 's who you look like . Who 's Benwaar ? Turn-of-the-century furniture maker . I 've sold a few of his pieces . Very hard to find . My god , you 're a dead ringer for him . When was the last time you saw Martine ? Oh , let 's see . First week of september . I remember because it was right before the break-in . You were burglarized ? And they had good taste , too . Stole the silver , left the plate . Took the lynch-bages and the moutons , left the rotgut . Robbed me blind . Your hunch was right . All the guys Martine went out with were ripped off . Right after she stopped seeing them . Pros ? Evidently . In and out fast . Seemed to know where the valuables were and the security codes . There had to be an inside man ... or woman . Our victim was a thief . So who wasted her ? One of the jilted lovers ? Possibly . I still like Browning for it . He found out she was playing him and then he killed her . Amsterdam . On our way . Let 's ask him . Browning just tried to kill himself . Figures . You should be in the hospital . You 're concerned about my well being . I 'm touched . You want to tell us why you did this ? Get lost . Guilt too much to live with ? My only regret is not cutting deeper . That way , I wouldn 't be here talking to you . Mr. Browning , your fiancee wasn 't who she seemed to be . We think she was part of a burglary ring . She used the dating service to meet wealthy men and rip them off , including you . Must 've been brutal , huh , Carl ? To find out Martine didn 't love you . That she stole from you . That she was using you . You don 't get it , detective . I knew she was a thief . She told me everything . I didn 't care . Even after she ripped you off . If she ripped me off . And I 'll never believe she did . Ever . Why 'd you do this ? I miss her . Isn 't that enough ? I found a buyer for it . It 'll fetch a pretty penny . It 's not for sale . Baloney . What 're you gonna do with it , wear it ? I 'm thinking of giving it back . Well , now I know you 're bent . That dame chiseled in on our play . Now she got a nice chassis , but come on . There 's something between us . Johnny on the spot 's in love ? You told me--only saps fall in love . When you get tired of looking around , it 's easier to say that . She 's a mark . She 's different . Then why 'd you steal the pin ? Don 't kid yourself , kiddo . Everyone 's a mark . Heard about your shooting . Tough . Wrong time , wrong place . I got shot once myself , right in the ass . Couldn 't sit down for weeks . So , what do they do ? Sit me behind a desk . So what 's the deal ? These high-end burglaries you 're working , - thinkhey 're related to a homicide . - How ? The victim went out with all the marks . The theory is she met them through a dating service , gained access to their apartmes , keys , security codes , you name it . So who killed her ? One of the marks ? Maybe . Probably . Well , we 've already recovered some of the items . Fenced by a turd named Ray de la Cruz . What stone can he be found under ? He 's in the wind . There 's a want card out on him . But if you come across him , watch your ass . He 's armed and dangerous . What a coincidence . So are we . I 'll talk to you . Unless de la cruz is hiding under your desk , you got nothing to worry about . Where do you think you 're going ? Therapy . I 'm working through my feelings of homicidal rage . You think this is a game , Amsterdam ? You could put your partner in jeopardy . I want you off the street . Give me your weapon . I wouldn 't want you to use it on the wrong person . Like you ? His name is Ray de la Cruz . He 's a fence , deals in high-end goods . Keep your ears open . I need to run him to ground . Thanks , Omar . Gotta go . Ms. Skoll ? Got a minute ? For you , detective , I 've got two . Can we walk ? I 'm meeting someone for lunch . Some bad news . We have evidence that Martine Shane was a thief . That she used your service to meet wealthy guys and rip them off . That 's not possible . We do thorough background checks . How 'd she come to your attention ? I don 't recall . A reference , I think . I 'd have to check my files . I just can 't believe she 'd do that . She had nothing . A waitress from nowhere who wanted to be discovered like a thousand other girls . We offered her a life . I 'd really like to know who gave you that reference . I 'll get back to you . Ok ? Hello , Kayla . Detective . I was wondering if I could take a look around . I 'm running out . Actually , I have a client . Pilates . Contrology . Union of mind and body . Created during WWI to help wounded vets . Worked for me . I 'll only be a minute . A thief ? That 's ridiculous . People aren 't always what they seem . Do you know how Martine got into soul mates ? The owner , I think . I can 't remember her name . Inga Skoll . Right . She spotted her at the restaurant where she was working . Did Martine ever talk about Inga ? Not that I can remember . How about her dates ? She talk about them ? Not much . She knew that I thought it was sort of silly . I mean , Martine didn 't need a service to get men . They found her . I 'm sorry , I 'm really going to be late . You were good friends ? I thought we were . But as you said , people aren 't always what they seem . Do you mind if I take this with me ? The blood on the towel we found in Browning 's boat is a match with our vic 's . Burnett wants us to pick him up . Can 't help you . I 'm on desk duty . Since when has that made a difference ? And Burnett is playing with my gun . Take Santori . Hey , Omar . What 've you got ? Ray de la Cruz . Nice-looking dog . He 's a fighter ? More of a lover , Ray . We need to talk . Go on ! Finish him ! Get him off of me . Get him off of me , come on ! Get him off of me ! I don 't care much about me . But you shot at my dog , Ray . You really shouldn 't have done that . Ok , ok . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Look , he 'll kill me . Yeah , but he 'll hurt you first . No smoking . I want a lawyer . You 'll need one . Resisting arrest , possessing stolen goods , murder . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold up , man . What the hell you talking about ? She probably looked a little better before you tossed her in the river . Martine Shane . What happened , Ray ? You get in a professional dispute ? Wait a minute . I 'm out there doing a little business . I didn 't kill nobody . I don 't know her . You were fencing goods from her jobs . I never seen her before . Who 'd you deal with ? You know someone named Inga Skoll ? Look , man , we did it by drop , all right ? They would contact me by a pay phone . I never knew her name . But it was a woman ? The best thieves are always women . you ok , John ? Go back to sleep . Already up . You don 't exactly seem like the high school reunion type . Searching for a murder suspect . She could be in this class . Under a different name . Well , she 'll still be there in the morning . I know you didn 't kill her . He does ? What about the bloody towel ? The towel was planted . That was the point of the break-in . Not to rob you . To frame you . Took you long enough to figure that out . Yeah . It reminded me of something in my past . A burglary that wasn 't a burglary . So who did it ? So who did it ? Must have been one of the thieves . What did the burglars take ? Exactly ? Not much . Some cash that was lying around . A watch . An old patek-phillipe . Some diamond cufflinks . Is that it ? A few things of Martine 's . Nothing valuable . This little friendship ring , you know , the irish kind ... - A claddagh ring . - Yeah , yeah . Once I gave her the engagement ring , she didn 't really wear it anymore . Tell me about the engagement ring . Three carats , flawless clarity . A real beauty . Now it 's at the bottom of the river . She ever talk about her former lovers ? She knew it 'd make me crazy . It 's not like I had illusions she was a virgin . I just didn 't want to hear . Once I heard her fighting with someone over the phone . Sounded like an ex . Don 't think he was too happy about her leaving . Now I know how the guy felt . Now that you know my whole story . I know nothing . You 're a complete mystery . You know my moniker . Only my close friends and the bulls know that . So what about you ? Are you really Olivia Behrendt ? Paula dorn from grand rapids , Michigan . Ah , your scars . Does each one come with a story ? What can I say ? I 'm easily hurt . Ditto . Falling for a grifter is a recipe for heartbreak . Ditto with actresses . You never know what 's real . Exactly . Well , this is real . Detective Amsterdam . Where is he ? He asked me to meet him here at 4 : 00 . It 's been half an hour . He 'll be here soon . Are you single , detective ? There are some guys out there who might find the cop thing a turn-on . Thank you . I 'm celibate . Who the hell do you think you 're talking to ? ! You think I give a rat 's ass about what happened to you last week ? Huh ? What , am I supposed to cry for you ? You know , just because you almost died ? Well , boo hoo . Go to hell . Always trying to be the hero . Never listening to what anybody says . Getting killed is what happens to cops like you . Her what do you know about being a cop ? You only play at being one . Sitting in your little office reading your little reports , you second-rate bureaucrat . Amsterdam ! Go ahead . Say one more thing to me , huh ? Come on , hombre . Come on . You don 't like it because I don 't play the game . I won 't kiss your ass . Which isn 't that great , by the way . The way you twitch it around here , you 'd think it was one of the seven wonders of the modern world . That is it . You are on suspension get him out of here now ! You want my badge , little miss sunshine , you got it ! Calm down , John ! Get out of my way . Detective ? Not anymore . - Where the hell 's a cab ? - Where are you going ? To the nearest bar . I 've got a car . A white wine . Your best single malt . Bring the bottle . You 're not serious . Do I look serious ? Hey , John , come on . Do we have to go somewhere else ? I 'm sorry about what happened . I don 't need your sympathy . I 'm about to break the case and that bitch can 't stand that I 'm a better cop on disability than she is on her best day . Happy times . You said you were about to break the case ? Let 's stop playing charades , Inga . Or should I call you susie ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Sure you do . You set it all up . The burglaries . You were Ray de la Cruz 's contact . That 's not true . And you know what ? I don 't care . A couple hours ago , maybe . But not now . I don 't care that you used to be Susie Bartkowski from jersey , that you 've been sued three times , that you 're up to your ass in debt , that you spotted the marks and Martine got you in . I ... don 't ... care . What do you want ? I have a piece of information . And I 'm--I 'm willing to sell it . Go on . Browning keeps a safe on his boat . Inside it there 's an emerald pin that napoleon gave josephine , or some such crap . It 's worth millions . Browning bought it for Martine as a " symbol of his love . " Now , because of our search , I got the combination to that safe . And the new security code to the boat . Care for another drink , detective ? Why not ? Hello , Kayla . You bastard ! You set us up . This is entrapment . Well , actually , it 's what 's known in the trade as a long con . I knew about Inga . I just had to make sure about you . You killed Martine . I loved her . That 's why you killed her . Because she stopped loving you back . You 're crazy . You even cut off her finger to get the ring that was the symbol of her betrayal . No . That 's where the bloody towel came from . No . You have no proof . We will once csu is finished . My guess is they 'll find traces of Martine 's blood at your place and probably her engagement ring . Saved it , didn 't you , Kayla ? She hurt me . Yeah . That 's not a good enough reason . Nice work , detective . Particularly the drunk scene . Apple juice . Been in aa for years . Personally , I thought the fight with sarge was overplayed . How 'd you know about us ? Psychological profiles , in-depth questionnaires , an extensive database . Then we match the likely perps with the victims . No magic to it . You really are a romantic . Amsterdam , I only have one question for you . Did you really mean what you said about my ass ? So how did you know ? Well , it turns out Inga and Kayla went to the same high school in Jersey . I saw a picture of them on their class reunion website . As juvies , they 'd gotten into some trouble together but under different names . Now , when Inga came up with this scam , they needed a third party . Who better than Kayla 's girlfriend ? It 's funny . Inga set Martine up with possible marks . She just didn 't count on her falling in love with one of them . Well , men and women . It 's a crap shoot . I 've told you , I wasn 't stealing it . I was putting it back . So you 're saying you stole it before . - Yes , but- - - don 't explain . It doesn 't help . Should have known better . Once a grifter , always a grifter . I think you should leave now . You 're not calling the bulls ? Why would I ? I care about you.I care about us . There is no us . Here . Since it means so much to you . I don 't want it anymore . Don 't worry about it , Johnny . It 's only paste . It isn 't real . Just like you . No bag ? It 's casual , but not that casual . I 'm not going . Really . So this is it . I told you I wouldn 't lie to you . Ok . What do you call what you 've been doing the last couple months ? Sara . No , I want to know . I told you the truth . And you didn 't want to hear it . That you were 400 years old ? That Omar was your son ? ! I mean , what 's next ? Little green men that live in your shoe ? ! - I don 't expect you to understand . - You 're right . I don 't . Not even a little . You 're either a congenital liar or delusional . Sara . That bullet , when it went through your heart , it killed something . It killed us . Is there someone else ? No . But you had to think about it . Yeah . That 's for hurting me . Where are you going ? As far away from you as possible .

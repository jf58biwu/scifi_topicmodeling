 It 's just ... the children are my responsibility . We 've been through this before . These children have been specially selected . thousands of lives can be saved . It 's not about a few children . It 's about the future of our species . it 's too late for doubt now . The process has already started . Just do what we agreed . you call the police ... and you tell them the children have disappeared . the subjects have been transported . Good . there 's a problem . Head count had twenty of them before transport . Now we 've only got nineteen . Someone 's missing . Shit ! Sheriff . Adams ? There 's twenty kids live at this orphanage . AII twenty of them have gone missing . - And then ? - After the power went out ... I went to check on the children . every one of them . They just ... disappeared . Did you have a nightmare ? My mommy says that there 's nothing to be afraid of ... in the dark . kid . Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive . Pinkerton . Carnby is coming in ... on flight 185 from Buenos Aires . He 's got the artifact . Intercept him at the airport . Get the artifact and kill him . So maybe you 're thinking I 'm an asshole ... scaring that kid for no reason ... but I 'm just trying to protect him . there 's a world around you ... that you 've trained yourself not to see . whatever . But inside all of us ... is an uncontrollable fear of the dark . but it 's not . Fear is what protects you ... from the things you don 't believe in . I Iearned the truth a Iong time ago- - just because you can 't see something ... doesn 't mean it can 't kill you . I lost my memory . erased . I know something bad happened back then at the orphanage . I 've been looking for answers ever since . You don 't have to believe me . and I 'm here to protect you ... from the things you don 't believe . You travel light . I carry enough baggage for the both of us . Trust me . man . What do you do ? You don 't want to know . you know- - learning about people 's lives . I 'm a paranormal investigator . Are you fucking serious ? really ? What does that mean exactly ? Let me put it this way . I hunt and track down the strange and unusual . Speaking of strange and unusual ... that cab 's been following us since we left the airport . - No shit ? - No shit . You want me to lose him ? I wouldn 't mind . Let 's do it . They really want something from you . Shit ! man ! My boss is gonna fucking kill me ! man ! Shit ! pull into this market up here . And kill someone ? It 's a total dream . Stay down ! You all right ? Where is he ? Hey ! Hey ! we got another delivery . I don 't have anything scheduled for today . What museum was it transferred from ? from Dr. Hudgens . " That must be a mistake . It 's probably for the big Abkani show . Abkani ? What the hell is Abkani ? It 's an ancient Native American civilization . this super-advanced culture ... they just disappeared . It says it 's only to be opened by Dr. Hudgens . This is AIine Cedrac . She 's the assistant curator . We have artifacts coming in from all around the world . until Hudgens gets back ... I will be doing all his cataloging for him . where is Hudgens anyway ? The show opens in a couple days . He 's off on another archaeological goose chase . He thinks he 's finally found the Arabis . So he sticks you with all the work . right ? I 'II be in my office if you need me . Yeah . They say a sunken ship is like a grave . It should never be disturbed . I 've been searching for the Arabis ... and now that I 've found it ... I 'm afraid your iII-informed superstitions ... aren 't enough to stop me . let 's see what we 've got . it 's John here . I don 't know if you 're back from wherever you were this time ... call me . It 's the nightmares . They 've started again . I need to know if it 's just me . please . are you going to open it up ... make sure it 's what you 're looking for ? The conditions must be perfect . there may be consequences . Is this made of solid gold ? the Abkani was the first civilization ... to use gold to house their valuables . They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits . we can 't even remember ... why we value gold in the first place . Let 's just load this on the truck . If the container is made of solid gold ... whatever 's inside must be worth a fortune . you have no idea . But I 'm looking forward to finding out . Listen . Listen ! You 'II make a terrible mistake ! The only mistake I 'd be making ... is letting you walk out with whatever 's inside . Throw him in there ! please ! No ! Captain . Let 's see what we 've got . Don 't open it ! John ? God . Krashinski ? Commander . I 've never seen anything like it . sir . sir . These are accurate readings . Jesus Christ . hello ? Did a shipment arrive for me today ? Dr. Hudgens . I started decoding the pictograms and- - Who told you to do that ? That crate was not to be opened . but I was only just gonna catalog it for you . miss Cedrac . Leave the tablet alone . I 'II catalog it myself when I get back . I- - I found them . something 's happened . The others are back . Yeah . Edward . Thank God . Linda . What 's wrong ? and he 's just gone . AII of his clothes are here . His car 's in the garage . It 's like he just got up ... in the middle of the night and walked out . I 'II be right over . when they opened the gate ... between our world and the world of darkness ... a few people survived by joining forces ... with the creatures from the other side . They gained supernatural power but lost their humanity . That would explain the man who tried to kill me this morning . I have this bad feeling ... that 's what 's happened to John and the others . you 've known each other since you were kids . Did he tell you he was leaving me ? Of course not . Edward ? What 's going on ? I 'II figure this out . I 'II find John . Don 't worry . OK . Fischer here . Fisch . It 's Carnby . - Edward . I know it 's been a while . You gotta do me a favor . I haven 't heard from you since you left 7 1 3 . What 's up ? A friend of mine who grew up in my orphanage ... disappeared last night . His name 's John DiIIon . Can you try to dig up some information ? but let me check . AII right . I have to take a trip down memory lane . I 'II meet you at 3 : 00 at our old hangout . OK ? Edward . - I 'II see you then . three . cockIe shells ... over . I Iike ... Edward . should I make some tea ? Sophie . Let me look at you . You 've been getting enough sleep ? and ... something happened to me as well . It 's happening again . I need your help . I want to find the others . I 'II get their files . Come on . Edward . You should visit more often . huh ? He just disappeared ? I understand you must be very concerned . I 'II let you know as soon as I hear something . thank you . I was recruited into Bureau 7 1 3 when I was 20 . I Iearned everything I couId about the paranormal . I was a good agent ... but it didn 't get me any closer to the truth . Every time I uncovered a new Abkani artifact ... it immediately got classified . I realized I 'd never get the answers I was looking for ... with 7 1 3 calling the shots . Why did I agree to this ? Fisch . It 's a beautiful day . right ? Carnby . right ? I tracked down the three you asked me about . They all disappeared last night . no car ... just up and walked out into the night . So that means all nineteen are missing . too . Nothing much in common ... except they all grew up in the same orphanage ... your orphanage . Carnby ? That 's what I 'm trying to figure out here . Fisch . I 'II see you around . It 's good to know I 've still got friends at the 7 1 3 . there 's someone here to see you . I missed you . you asshole . God . all right ? I can explain everything . Rob . I 'm gonna go . Give me one reason why I should ever even speak to you again . Look at this . I was in the Amazon for six weeks ... tracking poachers across their transport lines . Then I fell in with a group of ex-ChiIean military ... who were selling artifacts on the black market . That was found on the southern tip of chile ... in a gold mine . It 's Abkani . you could have called ... or even written ... just to let me know that you were alive . Do the inscriptions make any sense to you ? I 'm not sure . The thing is ... they 're all from different Iocations- - alaska ... and now this one from chile . that would have been ... like burying them at the ends of the earth . Yeah . But why ? If you want someone to build a puzzle ... why would you hide the pieces so far apart ? Now what ? Is Rob trying to create a mood or something ? Give me that . hello ? hello ? Miss Cedrac ? Mr. Carnby ? What the hell 's with the lights ? my Iife gets complicated ? I couId ask you the same thing . What is it ? Nothing . The hair on the back of my neck just stood up . hello ? Did you hear that ? Rob ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! What the hell was that ? Get down ! Come on ! Lock the door ! Get the key in there ! It 's our only way out of here ! AIine ! - You all right ? - Yeah . I 'm OK . I want a full security sweep of the area . - miles . - Sir ? call Fischer and tell him to get his boys down here now . Let 's go ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Scanners clear ? Scanners clear . Carnby ? too . You shouldn 't be here . This is my unit now . You must be very proud . Carnby . Got a little soft since you left 7 1 3 ? You should take her to the medic and check that arm . This way . I 'II catch up . Why are you still here ? Why am I still here ? I just got my ass chased ... around this goddamn museum by something I couldn 't see . I want to know what the hell they are ... what they 're doing in the goddamn city ! I want to know what 7 1 3 knows about it ! OK ? That information is classified . That means it 's none of your fucking business ! We 've got this under control . Thank you . I don 't need your help . Marko . I asked very nicely . huh ? AII right ! Burke . Maybe I have gotten soft . You just keep walking . miles . Fucking prick . Burke . - Hey . - Hi . I 'm fine . I need to study those artifacts . AII right . I 'm gonna go and figure out ... what 's going on with John and the others . OK ? Later . Carnby . I 'm not . Commander Burke is . Your curiosity have anything to do ... with the fingerprint of yours I found on this corpse ? the list of people I trust is short . I 'm not making it shorter . Have you I.D. ' d him yet ? We got his dentaIs . Agent James Pinkerton . He 's ex-7 1 3 . What ? You telling me he was an agent ? When ? Went M.I.A. twenty years ago . they 're practically invisible . Why the hell was he trying to kill me ? This might have something to do with it . Fused to the spinal cord . There 's another piece in here . It 's been severed . Never seen this kind of symbiosis before . This must be why his entire nervous system was compromised . Scanner 's still giving a reading . What ? The Abkani never cease to amaze me . Such a complex society at a time when most of humanity ... was hunting and gathering and huddling around fires . when did you get back ? A few hours ago . I heard you had some excitement . Are you all right ? but I 'm OK . I must apologize for snapping at you earlier . after all you 've been through ? - Where 'd you get that image ? - Edward . That 's a major find . I 'II have to analyze that . I 'II do that myself . It 's not a request . Where is the artifact ? - Everything OK in here ? - Who are you ? Miss Cedrac 's security detail . have you any idea who I am ? Dr. lionel Hudgens ... Science-spy division ... currently 7 1 3 advisor status . I know exactly who you are . I 'II have to hold off my curiosity till the morning . Dr. Hudgens . I meant to ask ... did you finally find the Arabis ? Just an empty shipwreck . Like you said ... another wiId-goose chase . too . But symbiosis is incomplete . I was electrocuted when I was a kid . That must have killed it . Can you remove it ? I couId try ... but it could paralyze you . So these organisms are somehow connected ... right ? We call them Zenoes . Catchy . When did they first appear ? Two years ago . They 've been 7 1 3 's top priority ever since . But it 's been almost exclusively in rural areas . This sort of urban infiltration is unheard of . Have you isolated any weaknesses ? They 're vulnerable to elements 76 to 79- - and gold ... negates their ability to disrupt electricity . If they disrupt electricity ... how come my flashlight still worked ? the closer the current is to its power source ... the less the disruption . this has been calibrated to track their disruption field . It won 't help you see them ... but it 'II let you know when they 're nearby . They live almost exclusively in the dark . sunlight is lethal in large doses . But only certain light frequencies can hurt them . These lamps have been set to an effective frequency . we use bullets ... coated in a photon-acceIerated Iuminescent resin . Cuts right through them . I 'm gonna need a Iot of these . The man who attacked me yesterday ... was after the Abkani artifact I found in chile . He was driven by the same force that controls the creatures . The Zenoes at the museum were after the same thing . It can 't be a coincidence ... John and the others have also gone missing . I 'm close to the truth . I know it . But whoever controls these things ... is going to send more after me . Commander Burke wants to see you . I heard you met with Carnby . Why ? he has intel we need . I trust him . You trust him . Right . Fischer . I need to know whose side you 're on . Or I can just remove you from the unit ... and you and Carnby can hang out anytime you want . go to the movies . What is it you need from me ? I need all the intel you have on Edward Carnby ... and I need you to keep your mouth shut . You understand me ? I do . I 'II get it . Sara ? Sara ? God . Sara ! Yes . Yes . Now you 're with us . It seems all the pieces fit together . Now I need your help to figure out why . With the pieces assembled like this ... maybe the computer can plot a location ... based on the symbols matching these constellations . what are we looking for exactly ? The Abkani used constellations ... to pinpoint a geographic location ... but I don 't think we could zero in ... more than maybe a 100-miIe radius . - Edward . - Yeah ? If this is correct ... I think the computer can pinpoint the location . isn 't it ? Shit . Here . Stay there . John ? John ? it 's me . It 's Edward . come on ! Come on ! This way ! This way ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! This way ! We better get out of here . Come on . - I just killed John . - What do you mean ? He was one of them . Something was controlling him . Then you had no choice . How many more are there ? There were twenty of us . Shit . alpha Unit reporting . Body count at six dead . please alert meds . How many casualties we got ? sir . We 're still getting some sort of readings . Stand fast . drop your weapon ! On the ground now ! as usual . I know you 're infected . I 'm taking you in . Are you kidding me ? huh ? right ? You really think I 'm one of these creatures ? I said drop your fucking weapon ! Burke ! this is Cheung . We 're on the upper level . I 'm reading four signatures . They 're moving to surround you . possible ambush . I 'm routing backup from the lower level . Proceed with extreme caution . Where the hell is our backup ? reinforcements have engaged targets in stairwell . You 're on your own . hold your fire ! Any others ? Scanner 's clear . Krash ? AII heat signatures motionless . clear . Repeat--you are clear . sir . I need a body count . Do not touch any bodies . and Science-spy will be there momentarily . we have got a new development . AII available agents are being rerouted ... to an abandoned gold mine in your sector . Scan is picking up multiple Zenoe signatures ... converging on the location . You have been assigned field command of the operation . Proceed there immediately . will one of you tell me what the hell 's going on here ? We picked up massive readings . That 's not what I asked . What the hell is going on here ? Fischer 's missing . So is Hudgens . I got a feeling this is just the beginning . What does Hudgens have to do with this ? That 's what I want to find out . I 'II brief you both in the air . Let 's go . I 'm gonna get this place locked up now . Commander . Carnby ... I 'II need my I.D. back . Let 's move it . Let 's keep that access open . Move it ! Move it ! Move it ! Move it ! Come on ! Burke ? To the Britannia gold mine . The Britannia mine ? I grew up in that area . Why are we going there ? They shut it down 22 years ago ... after six miners were killed in an unexplained accident . Did 7 1 3 investigate ? The report concluded there was no paranormal activity . But get this- - the agents in charge of the investigation ... were Dr. lionel Hudgens and James Pinkerton . Let 's go ! what are your readings ? Commander . This is unprecedented . Initiate 59-AIpha . No . hold them off for now . Wait for my command . We 've got three gueriIIas with flashlights set up ... gatIing guns with electromagnetic motion tracking . And every available agent in the vicinity is here- - I don 't care what you have to do . Get more bodies down here now ! Look at this place ! We need more ! Looks like we 're going to war . we are . Highest Zenoe concentration ever is in this area . It 's our chance to get rid of them once and for all . Come on ! Turner . Come on . why is that thing not up and running ? sir . The generator will be online shortly . Got to move faster . This is top priority . sir . Carnby . AII the readings I 'm getting from outside are huge . The stuff I 'm getting from down there ... I 've never seen anything like it before . What 's going on ? This is where we need to go . They 're all coming here for a reason . until we know what that is ... we 're not gonna be able to stop them . So we go in ? Yeah . - miles . - Sir . sir . Raise it up . Need to go higher . where 's the genny at right now ? miles . all right ? We need the power . Let 's go . yeah . Shit ! Move on it ! Let 's go ! We have confirmation . Perimeter defenses up . still waiting for the genny to come back on Iine . Roger that . Britannia operation in code yellow . AII units in place and standing by ... for genny to come online . Misfire . Misfire . No engagement . hold your fire . Repeat--hoId your fire . any updates ? Commander . Copy that . Looks like it 's a dead-end . I 'II go check it out . you said five minutes ten minutes ago . Come on . Where the hell are the lights ? I got it . I got it . About fucking time . miles . sir . Another dead-end . Maybe we should double back and try another tunnel . no . There 's got to be something else here . Look at this . It 's Abkani . There 's more over here . I think I found something . - Marko ! - Marko ! We 've got to go down there . people . How long do we have to hold them ? only till dawn . sir . - That 's right . Incoming ! EIectromagnetics around the mine are off the scale . Getting too much interference . satellite intel is compromised . Tracking multiple Zenoe clusters in the area ... mostly centered at ... no ! the generator 's gone ! hold your fire till they reach the second perimeter . 7 1 3 has approved reinforcements . They 're already en route . What is your status ? Can you read me ? Yeah . We 're retrieving Marko . goddamn it . hold your fire . hold your fire . hold your fire till they hit the perimeter . - Fire ! - Fire ! Faster . Come on . God ! help ! AIine ! Hang on ! Hang on ! I got you ! Grab ahold ! Get your footing ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Come on ! Move faster ! Come on ! Come on ! Get down there ! Jump ! I 'm stuck ! lay down . Lay down . get over here . I 'm gonna keep pressure on the wound . I need you to wrap this now . relax . Everything 's gonna be fine . - Gunships approaching . - Richards . do you copy ? Richards ? Feenstra . Check on Richards . Copy that . I don 't think we 're supposed to be here . check this out . It 's a warning . What 's the warning ? It says once you make it down here alive ... you 're already dead . That 's comforting . miles ! miles ! go again . I 'm trying to find a way out of here . anyone . go again . Krash ! Are you getting anything ? Nothing . I 'm getting nothing but static . Change your frequency . Try again . come in . fall back ! fall back ! We 've got to get out of here . We 've got to get out . Jesus ! AIine ! I got it ! Watch it ! Watch her legs ! Watch out ! Shoot it ! Shoot it ! Right there ! More ? Jesus . She 's gone . Shit . come on . She 's gone . Come on . We 've got to find a way out . Come on ! Let 's move ! Richards is dead . Everyone 's dead ! find some high ground . I 'm gonna stay here . Go . Go ! Watch your back . Burke . Something tells me we 're not the first ones down here . sir . Let 's go . Feenstra ! God . Carnby . It 's 7 1 3 . They implanted us with those things . This isn 't happening . It doesn 't make any sense . We 've been trying to stop something ... that they created the whole time . My guys are dying out there for nothing ! For fucking nothing ! Goddamn it ! Sir . come here . What 's going on ? give me the artifact . Yeah . It 's a key . This could be our only way out of here . The answers I 've been looking for my whole life ... could be on the other side of this thing . Some doors are meant to stay shut . Carnby ? I say ... we trust the Abkani . Drop your weapons ! Now move away from the door ! Do it ! Put them down ! You son of a bitch . Guns on the floor now ! That 's good . That 's good . Now get in here . Carnby ? You were my last failure here . If you hadn 't escaped ... 7 1 3 would never have shut down my experiments . I spent twenty years looking for the key to that door ! Now give it to me ! Give it to me ! No ? What a pity . You were a fine archaeologist . just give it to him . There 's been enough killing today . That 's fine . Right . Now get over there ! you know ... not without this . Hudgens . Don 't be insane . Don 't open that door . think about what you 're doing . Don 't open that door ! Shit . let 's just ... nice and slow . Go . Go . go ! Shit . Come on ! Come on ! This way ! Come on ! Commander Burke . miles . Richards . Yonek . Or any operations . Over . Can anyone read me ? Shit . go ! Run ! Hey ! There 's a ladder up here ! How 's it look ? It looks like it could be a way out . AII right . I 'm pulling . - Fuck . Fuck ! - What is it ? Detonator 's inactive . The signal 's not going through . We 'II find another way . Let 's get out of here ! I 've got to get back there . I 've got to get closer to them . You can hear them ! Let 's get the hell out of here ! Let 's go ! Come on ! You guys get out of here . I 'm going back . come on ! Burke ! Come on ! They were under us the whole time . I don 't believe it . Sister ciara ? The gate was closed again . like the Abkani discovered there 's a price to pay ... for bringing darkness into the light . The Abkani people were wiped off the face of the earth . And now ... it looks like it 's happening all over again .

 Minions ! Reduce speed to impulse power ! Charge the lightning cannon ! All battle stations at the ready ! At my signal , we show this Dr. Venture the true power of the cocoon ! Well , team , it looks like I 've got myself a costumed arch enemy . Not quite sure what the flying pine cone is all about ... but I 'll give Mr. Evergreen a run for his money ! ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ No time for inappropriate and baffling sing-song , Neddy ! Venture team ! Assemble Ventronic ! Ventronic Gold is go ! Ventronic Blue is go ! Ventronic Red is go ! Weee ! Slide fun ! Nooo , no no ! Neddy don 't like ! Assemble Ventronic ! Join me ! I form the legs ! I form the right arm ! I 'm flying ! Make a happy smile ! Go Ventronic ! What the fuck is that thing ? ! Umm , I think it 's a giant robot ... with an ice cream cone for one of its arms ... I think . Fire the lightning cannon ! Aim for the head . I want to be able to smell the burning flesh ... of that little Venture abomination ! The lightning cannon sucks ! Who loaded it with robot food ? Evasive action . Hard astern . Ventronic Blue , use the energy blade ! Aye , aye boss ! The helm is not responding ! All systems are down . We 're sitting ducks ! Hail Venture on the big screen . - Bringing him up- - - Wait ! I wanna do something . Hold on . You have one minute to surrender your big robot thing ! If you refuse , we will open fire ! How about this- - I 'll give you 20 seconds to kiss your wife for the last time ... then I finish you off , Mr. Evergreen . I-I 'm the Monarch . Oh , so the flying pine cone 's a- - Cocoon . OK , I 'll be right back . He didn 't go for it . I even did that cool spin thing . It 's a bit of a cliché . OK , alright , I have another idea . I 'm trying to arch here ! This isn 't how it 's done ! Honestly ! Wh-What are you doing , ya retard ? ! - No-no word ! - Yes it is , Neddy . Did he just cut me off ? Retard is a hateful word . We don 't use those slurs . I 'm your arch enemy ! I 'm not gonna use " bungling boobs , " or " meddling kids . " It 's not my style . That guy needs to get a thicker skin . Thicker skin ? Poor Ned has skin that 's three inches thick . Now how do you think that makes him feel ? Itchy ? I don 't know . Just keep it cat and mouse , not cat and missile . So it 's a game ? We fake fight ? That 's ridiculous . No , we sharpen our claws . It 's like fencing . It 's about the art of the fight . Good . Well , I 'm about to deliver my killing stroke . Then what ? Then the Guild steps up their game . You throw a rock , they throw a knife . You throw a knife they come to your house when you 're sleeping ... and murder your family . Look , Dr. Venture ... I love saying that . You call the Guild and you get the damned rulebook . I 'll be waiting . One false move and I will destroy you ... utterly ! Off screen ! How 'd that look ? Could they see the fire ? I don 't think we 're fooling anybody . We have to come up with something soon or it is over . You didn 't marry a fool ! Believe me , no Venture will take down the Monarch ! Engineering , restore impulse power ! Henchmen 21 and 24 , front and center ! And henchman number one . I want you three to execute a Dark S-7 Maneuver . On the double . Yes , Monarch . I gotta ask this- - Is there a reason you always use 21 and 24 ? I know it sounds crazy ... but they both have that rare blend of expendable and invulnerable ... that makes for a perfect henchman . Alright , please tell me you know ... what the hell a Dark S-7 Maneuver is . I think it 's when , uh- - The " dark " prefix indicates that it 's a stealth maneuver . The S-7 indicates that- - Dude , who are you ? 24 and I work as a duo . We 've done all we can . I 'm sorry your placement isn 't working out . But really , it 's not our problem . The Guild of Calamitous Intent is antagonist relations only . Well , who handles the good guys ? Whoa ! I think the less hurtful term is " protagonists . " Oh , yeah , sorry . Who handles the protagonists ? What , are you serious ? O.S.I. , duh ! Can you patch me through ? Oh , sure . Just let me get my red phone , the hotline . No , I 'll shine the O.S.I. Signal . No , no , no- - if we really believe and click our heels , they 'll- - OK , OK ! I get it . Newbie . Did you see his creepy little body ? Oh , my God , when you were a kid ... did you ever make G.I. Joe hump Rainbow Brite ? Yeah . He 's what their kid would have looked like . They 're retreating , follow them ! Belay that order ! Sweetie , what are you doing ? I 'm sorry . We barely have enough power to stay afloat . And we don 't have one weapon online . Do you trust me ? Uh ... Kind of . Well , it 's now or never . You have to trust me ! Follow them ! Incoming from Venture . Perfect . Bring him up on the big screen ! Monarch , you have been bested . Now cease this non- - Butterfly ! Pretty ! Thank you , Neddy . I 'll handle this . Sorry , we like to let Ned make his own decisions . Then I hope he decides to kiss his leathery ass goodbye . You have played right into my trap ... and now you die ! Fire the lightning cannon ! Engineering , jettison the lightning cannon out the port hatch ! Navigation , adjust attitude X and Y 20 degrees ! Dr. Girlfriend , cut all external power ! What was that about ? Some men are controlled by their hatred . Clouds their senses and leads them down the path of ruin . Let that be a lesson to you . I guess I shouldn 't finish that giant cocoon ... I was building , then . OK ! I was a pirate ! I get it ! Look , if you can 't get over my pirate past ... we 'll never move forward . Boys , the Monarch is retreating . Now isn 't the time for this . Agreed . Back to Spider Skull Island . We 'll reformulate our methods there ! Yes , let 's ignore the pirate . He used to be bad . Ventronic , take us home ! I know you can hear me . Navigation ! Get this heap to the lair . Get up . We need to make some modifications to the cocoon . Yeah , are you gonna tell me what the hell you have planned ? Why ? You don 't trust me ? I mean , I 'm trying to . It 's not that I don 't- - You know , you- - You ... Just help me get this chair loose . O.S.I. , can I help you ? Yes , this is Dr. Jonas Venture , Jr . Can you connect me to the office of Arch Relations , please ? This is O.S.I. Dry Cleaning and Laundromat . I think you have the wrong number . I 'm quite sure I dialed it correctly . I 'm quite sure I 'm ironing a shirt . You have the wrong number there , buddy . Boss , there 's somebody knocking at the front door . Knock at the front door ? This is an isolated island . Who just drops by and knocks at the front door ? Didn 't even know we had a front door . Jonas Venture , Jr . ? Oh , sorry , matey , you want the boss man . I 'll- - urgh . Is there a reason you just darted my man ? I didn 't see you down there . - Jonas Venture , Jr . ? - I am . So who are the dead men I 'm speaking to ? - That 's a joke . - Regular cut-up . They should give him a reality show . - I 'd watch it . - I 'd watch it twice . Even if Flavor Flav was in it . My name is Mr. Doe ... and this is my associate , Mr. Cardholder . Sorry about putting your man down . Precautionary . A harmless tranquilizer dart . You understand . Judging from your shoot first ask questions later tactics ... I 'll just assume you men are with the O.S.I. ? O.S.I. ? Never heard of it . Dr. Venture , you know that the O.S.I. denies any knowledge ... of the Guild of Calamitous Intent ? I never mentioned the Guild . No , but I did . We were just passing by ... and heard that you have a butterfly problem . And you see , me and my associate here are amateur lepidopterists . You ... wanna see my stamp collection ? Only if we were philatelists . Which we aren 't , Mr. Smart guy . Oh , my head 's gonna explode . I can 't hear squat . You should perform the Valsalva Maneuver . Look , Mister " I 'm the Best Henchman Ever ... " we 'll get to business in a second . I 'm trying to pop my ear . The Valsalva Maneuver is ... when you adjust the pressure in your middle ear , silly . A swallow or a yawn should do the trick . That has a name ? Listen , dude , don 't get cozy with us . You 're the guy who doesn 't come back . Yes , some guy who just shows up ... that nobody 's ever seen before . Right , and he 's all professional . Yeah , dude , you 're a goner . Let me tell you a story about a little henchman named Speedy . Oh ! Argh ! Captain ! You OK ? Man , get off my back ... Mom ! Sorry . You look like you needed help . So I 'm a disappointment , I guess . Help the pirate . The pirate can 't do anything for himself . Why are you such a bitch ? Like you 're perfect . What has gotten into you ? Sweet tranquilizer dart , that 's what . So get out ! You 're always trying to bring me down . And bring me a fucking sandwich ! - The Monarch has killed ... - As in cold blooded murdered . ... his last five arch enemies . Now that sounds like a violation to me . Sounds like a violation to anyone with ears . So what now ? I 'm not sure what the proper procedure is ... for dealing with unhinged ... and quite honestly , incompetent arch enemies . We are recommending ... that you pin this butterfly to a piece of cardboard . As in cold-blooded murder . To assist us in this matter we took the liberty of inviting an exterminator . A specialist in your specific bug problem . Little man has friend waiting to play . Tickles . That 's quite a monster you got . He have a leash ? I bet his eyes are as gooey as the next guy 's . Funny hat ! Ned wants funny hat ! Lower it , Cardholder . The ape 's daffy . Head full of pudding . Friend ! Looks like our exterminator has arrived . Hey ! Hey , hey ! I 'm not supposed to be in here ! I see , so you just want to kill the Monarch . That seems like the sporting thing to do . You wanna what , shoot him ? And all his men and his wife ? You could steal his cattle , too . Maybe burn his village down ? It 's an antiquated system . I mean , my father did this fake arch enemy nonsense in the ' 60s . Maybe my brother is good with this namby-pamby ... guy-in-a-costume-chases-you-around nonsense , but I 'm not . No disrespect , Jonas , but it isn 't so easy . These guys like their system . It 's what they do . You take that away ... and you are looking at a bunch of pissed off nut bags ... with ray guns and giant- - I don 't know ... a giant octopus slash tank with laser eyes . I 've seen one of those . I like the cut of this guy 's jib . I like the cut of his hair . All right , fine . Then what if we keep it traditional ? This Monarch character has broken some rules . If by " rules , " you mean skulls . And if by " broken , " you mean pulverized . So we put on a big show . We do it like dear old Daddy Venture would 've . Then everybody 's happy . Everybody but the Monarch . What do you have in mind ? I 'm gonna fall off it . Just use nails for now , or glue . I don 't care . - All right , here it is . - Give me the news ! If Protagonist aggression exceeds Level 8- - I think trying to actually kill me is at least that . The Antagonist , in the case of survival or escape ... is granted extended vengeance . This includes Guild sanctioned immediate relatives . So , all I gotta do is stay alive ... and Rusty Venture is mine ? That 's what it says . Dr. Venture is a Guild sanctioned rel- - Whoa ! Finally ! Vengeance is mine ! Which one of you idiots broke my wife ? What are you guys doing ? I 'm freezing . Can we be done , please ? Yeah , I swallowed too much water . Now I 'm gonna get diarrhea , thank you very much . That tunnel down there leads to the main room . Take a deep breath . I 'm not sure how long it is . No way ! I got freaked out when I had to do that playing Tomb Raider . Oh , and she did that creepy drowning , contortion thing . That was grizzly . Yeah , no way . What ? We have to . This is how we get to the main room ... to complete the Dark S-7 Maneuver . OK , fine , I 'll go ahead alone . Going alone ? This is why you new guys always die . You just can 't smell a cliché coming . Dude , you are way too into this . Seriously , what kind of douche ... would blindly swim an underwater tunnel ? Then what- - Yeah , what about going that way ? It 's hardly the best route . Hands up , who peed in the water ? Well , I guess we could go that way . Check it out , gentlemen . Constructed by a little old villain named Scaramantula ... and only used on Sundays to go to church . Been dying to give it a spin . Aww , no fucking way . Late ' 60s Ultra Death Ray ! She 's amazing . Saddle operated with Doom Co . Gearing . Freaking gorgeous . If that were a woman , I 'd marry her . And I 'd jeopardize our friendship by nailing your hot wife . Gyroscopic positioning ? At six points . And get this , it comes up out of the top of the Skull . That 's how it 's done . I didn 't know there was a museum ... to Dr. Venture on this island . This is awesome ! You think there are rides , or , like , a moonwalk ? One of you have an extra electro patch ? No , we don 't wear our utility belts . Yeah , they 're dorky . Kinda like fanny packs for henchmen . Plus they make me look fat . Blame it on the utility belt . And you guys think I 'm gonna die . I carry my full complement of utilities . He says as he electrocutes himself . I 'm not gonna die ! Stop it ! He grabs a bomb on accident right here . Kaboom ! I 'm not gonna die . Yeah , and then the snake jumps out and bites you right on your eye . Stop it ! OK , done . Easy peasy . So now you know what the Dark S-7 Maneuver is . We do ? I 'm getting good at rebuilding this thing . It looks like it should . No , it looks pretty good if you don 't turn your head . Monarch , the S-7 Maneuver is complete ! It was ? Those idiots are amazing . All right . Engage the Capricorn Device ! Then bring the wee Venture freak up on the ... little screen we just wheeled in front of my throne . Hailing him now . Thought you got rid of me ? On the contrary , my dear Monarch I was hoping to hear from you . And were you hoping that I was racing ... my newly revamped flying cocoon toward your island ? He 's about 20 miles offshore . He is really humming . I didn 't even know that thing could move like that . Goodbye , Dr. Venture . You might want to make a list of questions for your father . - Did you get that ? - It was kinda vague . Well , his father 's dead . So , you know , he can ask him stuff because he 'll be joining him in Hell . Ah ! I should have said the " Hell " part . That would have been cool . Yeah , that would have been the way to go . That , and then the menacing laugh . So the butterfly falls willingly into the Spider Skull 's web . - Mmmm , nope . - Just a bit confusing . Good try though . It 's my first shot at it . You know , I 'm starting to see the allure of all this . So , I guess you wanna shoot it yourself ? Of course ! Well , do you have any Death Ray experience ? I mean , those things can kick . Is the great Brock Samson jealous ... of my super sweet Death Ray ? - Kinda . - Tough tiddlywinks ! Fire her up ! This floor is laser trip-wired . We have to find an alternate route . Yeah , maybe over a shark tank or something . Yeah , you go off and meet your Maker while 24 and I keep going this way . Knock it off , you guys . It 's starting to get to me . You still don 't get it . 24 and I have been on , like , 1 , 000 missions . We 've been shot at , dipped in acid . Brock Samson hit me with a car . Drove right into my kidney . Here I am . Yeah , we could walk across this floor and nothing would hit us . But then this huge log would swing down and take your head off . Here ... what 's your name ? - Henchman Number One . - See , you are nameless . I 'm Scott Hall . My name is Scott Hall , OK ? Nope . Won 't help . Yeah , now it 's just pathos . When you 're dying in my lap , and I 'm all ... " Scott , Scott ! Don 't you quit on us ! Don 't you dare ! " You just made your unavoidable death more pathetic . Fuck it . Nothing 's gonna happen to me . Well ? Oh , come on ! Six miles and closing fast ! Trajectory target at X-1 5 , Y-23 ! Blind fire available at two miles ! Re-targeting ! I have an intruder alert , museum floor ! Who puts a museum on a hidden island fortress ? Jonas , there 's an intruder in the museum ! What ? Zapruder films in the museum ? No ! There 's someone in the museum . Can 't be . We 're closed on the weekends ! I 'll check it out unless you feel like letting me shoot that thing . No chance , Samson . I 've always wanted to try this but the opportunity never comes up ! Poor guy missed out on , like the greatest cliché in deception . But getting killed by Brock ... that 's a glorious way for a henchman to go . You guys are henchmen , aye ? Aah ! Jeez , you 're real ! I used to be . Say , you gents don 't carry dart guns , do ya ? Yeah ... tranquilizers . Gonna rat us out ? Not if you give me a hit of dart . You wanna be shot with a tranquilizer dart ? I have the dart monkey on me back . Just one , man . After this one , I 'm going straight . I just need that one last dart . Just one more . OK , but dude , you know this is creepy . Right in the neck , if you don 't mind . Yes ! It 's like getting sucked off by an angel ... a sweet angel with a tranquilizer . Steady ... Steady ... Get ready to light that thing ! He 's almost on you ! Now ! So , I guess we 're retired again . Oh , and I have to move back in with my dad . It 's so humiliating . Hello ? 21 and 24 , prepare for pickup ... at drop point Alpha-7 . Monarch ... Monarch ? We thought you died ! What ? That midget shot his cannon into a cloud . How do you not know that ? You dinks are the ones who installed ... the video surveillance patch . We did ? Oh . That 's what the Dark S-7 Maneuver is ? I hate that you 're my best men . Honestly . Hey , what happened to henchman One ? Death by Samson . Perfect ! We shall avenge his death ! We raid the Venture Compound at dawn ! Sweet ! Over and out . - So we saved the day ? - I think so .

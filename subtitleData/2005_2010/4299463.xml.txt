 In the future , my son will lead mankind in a war against Skynet , a computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time ... some to kill him ... one to protect him . Today we fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . To change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Episode 107 : The Demon hand . v. 1.00 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... My turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player that has ever lived and probably ever will live . This is my partner , Dmitri Shipkoff . I built the turk , but ... Dmitri taught it to play chess . - You talk about it like it 's human . - Well , you never know . - Show me what you found . - No name , but he 's got this tattoo on his arm . That 's a tattoo from a Skynet work camp . - He 's a resistance fighter . - Then you know him in the future . So do you do . He 's one of your best soldiers . It was you , wasn 't it ? You wanted to kill him , and you did . I didn 't do it . All I wanted was the Turk . Somebody else killed him and took the machine . You gotta get outta here . If you haven 't figured it out , I have a T-888 on my ass . Now if you found me , it will too . He needs a doctor . - You 're gonna go out , kidnap one ? - Don 't let it touch me . - We have to stop you bleeding . - Get away from me ! - You don 't even know who he is ! - He 's your uncle . He doesn 't know . They say when a person dies , the soul lives on . The soul . The thing that separates us from the machines . Cameron had burned the metal monster . 2,000 degrees . I suppose they did the same to Andy . There was nothing left of either . Nothing that told the story of who or what they were . Gone is gone . Ashes to ashes , dust to dust . When I go , bury me in the Earth . A part of me died years ago with Kyle Reese , but a part of me lives on in John . It 's that not a soul , I don 't know what is . - The triple eight . - Vaporized . The russian , Dmitri . - You found him ? - He took off after Andy 's murder . No , if he has the Turk , then ... Put the machine on it . She 'll find him . I know . It 's what they do . - How is he ? - Better . - Still pretty out of it . - Is he ... gonna stay here or what ? Let 's see if he lives first . And somewhere in this city , a naked cop bleeds in an alley . The hand . I couldn 't acquire it . - Why not ? - The FBI has it . You 're playing hooky . Today . No , I can 't miss class today . We have to find the hand . Destroy it . No loose ends . Cyberdyne built Skynet . - With the chip , remember ? - And the hand . Look , the feds have it now , Mom . I can 't help . Besides , absent gets me on the radar . I can play hooky . Find Dmitri . Derek says he has a sister who teaches ballet . Start with her . Low profile , no guns . You might wanna change . Yeah , this is sergeant Johnson , senior property over at LAPD . Got a little problem . Wonder if you could help me . - What 's going on ? - I got this new booking officer rookie . Between you and me , I think he was drunk when he logged evidence on a robbery . Might have ended up on your felony escape . - What are you missing ? - Prosthetic hand . - Really ? - Really . DR Number ? 084476732 . I can send someone to pick it up . - I don 't see any hand on here . - You sure ? Item 17 . Hang on a second . Agent ellison ? - Yeah ? - I got lapd property on the line . They 're asking about a hand . From your felony escape . They 've it listed on the authorization , but we don 't have a record of it . I never saw any hand , fake or otherwise . Agent in charge says he never saw it . Wanna talk to him ? No , no , I 'll take his word . Thanks And wonder if God or the Devil ... or death itself was sending me a message from the future all the way back through time . Machines , Sarah . Machines . You can pretend they 're not , but they are coming . And they are faster and stronger . And they 've been built to do one perfect thing . To kill you . They will kill you . And your friends and your family . And your mother and your father . And kyle reese and your son . Your son ! They will kill everyone you love and everyone you hold close , and there is nothing you can do about it . Because they are coming . They are coming , and they will find you . Because that 's what they do ! That 's all they do ! - That 's all they do ! - I need help here ! - Get in here ! - They 'll kill you ! - Come on , where 's the stuff ? - They will kill you ! Now if what you 're saying is true , surely there would be some evidence . No one believes me . Thank you . So this is where Sarah Connor spent three years of her life . This is it . Dr. Silverman retired right after she escaped . Where is he these days ? Got himself a cabin in the mountains near Arrowhead . Growing his own vegetables , working on his book . We don 't hear much from him anymore . I 'd love to talk to any other staff that was here when she escaped . Unfortunately , there 's no one left . Not a janitor ? How long would you work here if you could find another job ? Right . Good . Long reach down . Excellent turnout . Hold ! Hold . And close . Beautiful . Thank you . See you next week . What is she doing ? Pas de chat . Step of the cat . - Will you show me ? - That is the advanced class . You are a beginner , yeah ? You have taken ballet before . No . The height is nice . Beautiful feet . But your upper body is a little mechanical , yeah ? Remember , you are a cat . I 'm a cat . Come next week . We need to develop your flexibility and your imagination . Remember ... dance is the hidden language of the soul , yeah ? What are you doing ? What 's it look like ? Looks like you 're loading guns that I know for a fact were already loaded . True enough . I loaded ' em . No offense . I just don 't like firing a weapon I didn 't set myself . Anyway , you should take it into the kitchen or something . Mom wouldn 't like you doing this in her room . Why ? Because it 's her room . Listen , the paramedic that patched me up . Where 'd he come from ? That 's Charley . He was her boyfriend . Her fianc√© . Actually , a long time ago now . He 's a liability . - He 's not gonna tell anybody . - How do you know ? Because I know him . I trust him . I can 't believe you trust anybody . Maybe it 's just him . You trust the machine . What a joke . Walking around with a name . Like it 's a person . It 's not a person . Not something you should be trusting . What 's going on ? Nothing . I need you to get on the computer and find an address . You 're making a mistake . - How 's that ? - The machine has gotta go . This morning you had me sending her out to do our dirty work . Dirty work is all they 're good for . Don 't let yourself think that you can train them like a pet , because it 'll be the last thing that you think . John doesn 't know everything . You should be resting . They never rest . You can 't have that thing here . Can 't sleep with it here . That gonna help ? You never know . Does it help to sleep on the whole trunk ? Go in my bedroom again , I 'll bust your head . What happened with the ballet teacher ? Dance is the hidden language of the soul . First you have to have a soul . I mean about Dmitri or the Turk . - I 'm going back today . - What 's the status on the hand ? - Got a good idea who has it . - Who ? FBI Agent Ellison . Same guy that questioned me in county lockup ? They only have one FBI Agent in this town ? Only one who can put this whole thing together . From what I saw at his house , maybe he already has . Pancakes . We eat at the table . - Your pancakes are getting cold . - Here 's Dr. Silverman 's address . - You 're not hungry ? - No . Since when ? Ms. Connor , I 'm from DCFS . I 've brought some paperwork for you . Everything should be in order . All we have to do is cross the T 's dot the I 's . It basically states that you voluntarily and unequivocally consent , that you have been advised of the legal consequences of this relinquishment , that you understand this is irrevocable . And once these papers are signed , all parental rights will be terminated . And sign here . We 'll get a certified copy to the judge . I guess you 're not hungry either . You might have fooled them , but not me . I know you . I know you too . Dr. Silverman . Can I help you ? Special agent James Ellison . Hello . What can I do for you , agent ? I 'd like to talk to you about Sarah Connor . You like to come in ? Thank you . Well , I don 't like to use the term textbook in relation to any of my patients , but Sarah Connor was depressed , anxiety-ridden , manic ... Violent with paranoid delusions . Is that what it was ? Delusions ? Robots , soldiers of the future , apocalypse . You tell me . Also she could be remarkably charming . Even persuasive . Beware of false prophets . You a man of the book ? It has brought me comfort at times . More tea ? Yes , yes , thank you . The thing that most people don 't understand about psychiatry is that it is an imperfect science . What are you doing here ? Watching you . I 'm a little out of shape . Teaching takes all my time . My brother says if you wanna be good at anything you have to practice every day . - Your brother is right . - Do you have a brother ? Yes . Is he a dancer like you ? He plays chess . So does my brother . Excuse me . Get lost . Do you have any idea who this is ? No . Do you ? Who are you ? You 're just a girl . How did you do that ? I 'm looking for your brother . Are you police ? I 've already told the police everything I know . No , I 'm not police . But I do find them useful . What do you want ? I can help your brother . Tell me where he is . Untie me . FBI . That 's a good touch . Who do you think I am ? I know who you are . Coming here asking about Sarah Connor . Yes . Matthew 7 : 15 . The full verse is , " Beware of false prophets " which come to you in sheep 's clothing , " but inwardly they are ravening wolves . " You 're from the future . - You 're one of them . - I 'm ... Oh , come on . If I was who you say I am , then how could you poison me ? The tea was a test . But then it occurred to me that you could be an advanced model smart enough to trick me into thinking you were passed out . Come on . Look ... Kidnapping an FBI agent is a federal offense . Carries a sentence of life in prison . If you let me go now , we 'll forget this ever happened , okay ? - Once you 're far away ... - Wait , wait , no ! John hasn 't been answering his cell phone . When he gets home , you tell him we need to talk . Where you heading ? Arrowhead . I think Ellison might be there . He 's a strong boy . You know , strong ... strong opinions . I don 't know where he gets that . - His father ? - Out of the picture . That 's too bad . Can I ask you about my brother ? Kyle ? John told me he died fighting . Do you know ... Where he is now ? In the grass . I can take you there someday if you want . It 's an honest mistake . Can 't be too careful . Tell me . Do you believe in the ... apocalypse , agent ? Yeah ... I 've read revelations . Could it be that ... the apocalypse in the book and ... the predictions of Sarah Connor are one and the same ? I suppose it 's possible . What do you think ? He came down the hall . It was a large man . I thought it was a man until ... He threw the guard through the window just like a rag doll . Not an ounce of emotion . This blank ... Like a death mask . Then the other one came . There was two of them ? There were different . The second one was almost beautiful . Like perfect . Like a changeling . The face of mercury . What about Sarah ? She was there . She was on the floor . And the boy was with her . He was screaming . And then the ... the first one , the big one , I 'll never forget . He reached out his ... hand ... and he said , " Come with me if you want to live . " Like the God reaching out to man . Like the Sistine chapel . The hand of God . Hand of God . Yeah . Though ... There 's no proof , so we don 't talk about it . All of us who were there . What if I told you I have proof ? What do you mean ? A piece of evidence I found during my investigation . That 's why I came to you . For your corroboration . To show you that Sarah wasn 't crazy . Nobody ... is crazy . What is it ? The hand of God . It 's a good thing you told me about this . Yeah . I told you ... I 'm on your side . I wish that were true . - What does that mean ? - Do you know what would happen if the wrong people got a hold of this ? I can 't let you stop her . She 's dead . So was Jesus once . You won 't feel a thing , I promise . Dug up some clean T-shirts for you . Thanks . I wasn 't sure how many you 'd need . Depends on how long you 're staying . Not that great sleeping on the couch , is it ? Slept on a few of them myself . Yeah ? When was that ? When my mom was locked up . I kicked around . With friends and foster families . Mom was in prison ? Mental hospital . You go around blowing up buildings and ranting about robots , it happens . It sounds rough . There was this , uh- - There was this one family . Todd and Janelle . I was with them for a while , and ... They were okay . Of course , I hated them . They wanted to adopt me . I 'm sure your mom would 've died before she let that happen . Yeah , you 'd think . Look , John ... What can happen to a person inside four walls ... screws with your head . Makes you do things you never thought you 'd do . Some people never give up . Some people always fight . Fewer than you think . So you ever wonder what happened to Todd and Janelle ? I know what happened . I got them killed . Tell him . Come on . You 're the one who reported the Turk missing . - Do you have more ? - What happened to it ? A man came to see me . Offered me money to steal the Turk . I owed a lot of money to the people who helped me bring my sister . So I changed the endgame protocols in order for it to lose its last match . If we 'd won , and we would 've won , I never could 've got her out of there . I was paid money for it . $ 20,000 . It wasn 't enough . I need more of these . Please , I need more of these . Who bought the Turk ? Okay . That 's all I have . Thank you for explaining . Where are you going ? Hey , where you go ? You promised you would help us ! Oh , my god . I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . Apology accepted . Get up ! Where is it ? She took it . What ? Who ? She took it . She took it . Did you find the Turk ? Dmitri stole it from Andy , - then sold it to a man . - Who ? Where 's Dmitri now ? Dead . So is his sister . Did you kill them ? It wasn 't my mission . I never wanted you to see that tape . I was gonna destroy it . But since you did , did you notice the date ? The date on the tape . June 8 , 1997 . Do you know that date ? I do now . That 's the date you gave up being my mother . That 's the date I broke out of there . The day you came for me , I was coming for you . Because about three seconds after I signed that paper , I knew I couldn 't live without it . I was coming for you , and I was gonna die trying . You almost did . So did you . And you were mad as hell about it . You yelled at me . Told me what a stupid move it was . I might 've oversold that a little . I 'll always find you . I 'll always find you . There was a time I was a hero to my son . He thought I walked on water . He knows better now . We all have weak moments . Moments where we lose faith . But it 's our flaws , our weaknesses , that make us human . They 're here . They 're here . They 're here ! They 're everywhere ! Science now performs miracles like the gods of old , creating life from blood cells , or bacteria , or a spark of metal . But they 're perfect creatures . And in that way , they couldn 't be less human . There are things machines will never do . They cannot possess faith . They cannot commune with god . " Every tree that no bringeth forth good fruit " is hewn down " and cast into the fire . " They cannot appreciate beauty . They cannot create art . If they ever learn these things , they won 't have to destroy us . They 'll be us .

 NARRATOR : Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : - You 've got a nuclear sub ? - Seawolf sub . The Jimmy Carter . We got a scrubbed Trip-8 for a captain . Damn it , Cameron . You 're supposed to burn the endos . What 's happening with you ? CAMERON : I 've planted an explosive in my skull . - It 's a small amount , but enough . RILEY : I saw the metal . She knows I saw it . - Master fear . Remember the mission . - I can 't go back there . You are here to keep John Connor away from her . - I can get her to tell me the truth . - Stay away . Cameron 's supposed to kill me . You knew that was the only thing that would turn John against her . I rescued you from hell , and I took you to paradise . [ GRUNTING ] [ GUNSHOT ] You don 't need to be so dramatic . It 's a milk run . A milk run across 8000 miles of metal-infested ocean . If you 're gonna be like this every time- - Listen . Jesse , I 'm going on a mission too . - Oh , I see . One of those missions . - No . It 's something else . - It 's different . - Different ? How 's it different ? - What does " different " mean ? - " Different " means different . Just listen to me . You 're stuck in a can under the ocean with one of those things . Don 't worry about Queeg . He 's a good bloke . He 's not a bloke . Jesse , he 's not on our side . Don 't ever think that . Aim for the chip . Aim for the chip , they don 't get up . I love you too . Derek . [ SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] It means , " I 'll see you later . " [ SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] What are you doing ? Moving . Yeah , well , seems about the right time for that . Get your stuff sorted . I 'm nearly done with the living room . I 'm gonna start on the garage . Uh ... . Well , hey , why don 't you let me take the garage ? I got a lot of memory cards and flash drives out there . I don 't want to save our Dakara records and torch my copy of " Space Invaders . " It 's all yours . Thanks . [ SIGHS ] Great , it looks like a robot serial killer lives here . Well , I guess one does . - I 'm doing inventory . - Well , don 't do it here . We need to clear all this stuff out before Mom comes in and finds it . Dig a hole out back , down below the retaining wall . I 'll bury the parts and come back for them later . We have to find a place to burn them . And we will burn them . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] [ PEOPLE CHATTERING ] What you drinking ? I don 't know . You don 't know what you 're drinking ? There 's booze in it , some sugary crap to cut the hell out of the burning taste , and some ice . Of course , this one 's pretty much empty . Could you get her another one of whatever she 's drinking ? - If you don 't know , how do you order it ? - Just like you did . But it 's gotta start somewhere , right ? You can 't sit down and ask for that right off . What happened to your face ? You ask a lot of questions for a guy who wants to get in my pants . - Do I ? - Yeah , see ? There 's another one . That 's a nice costume . You thinking about a career in the military ? Actually , I fly P-3s . For the Navy . - Oh . Brown Shoe . - Guilty as charged . You ? - Submarine . Bubblehead . - Oh , bubblehead . - They let women on subs in Australia ? - Yeah . Reprogrammed killer robots too . [ CHUCKLES ] Yeah , we don 't discriminate . Well , there 's a coincidence . I hunt subs . You drive subs . Sort of like the wolf and the sheepdog . Not that I 'm comparing you to a dog or anything . It 's a good point . In fact , I just remembered something . - What 's that ? - Sheepdogs hate wolves . And I hate Brown Shoes . I can 't believe you guys are just up and moving like this . You could let me throw a party . You know , you never did come to dinner . Tape ? It 's okay . It 's not like you 're moving to Mars , right ? I mean , we can still totally keep in touch . - Absolutely . - Oh , here , let me help you with that . No , no , I 'm good . Sit down . You know , I 'm fine . People say it takes a while to get back to fighting trim , but I snapped back like a rubber band . - You know , mostly like a rubber band . - You look great . I 'm thinking if I can breast-feed him till he 's 5 maybe I can trick my body into letting me keep these boobs . Kidding . Sort of . - And who 's got the baby ? - Trevor . He 's not back . He 's just visiting . He said he needed some daddy time . I don 't blame him . Not after the call they got last night . They found a girl in the river , shot through the chest . Trevor said that it looked like she 'd been executed . That 's terrible . Pretty little blond thing . I mean , probably moved here from Iowa or something to be an actress fell in with the wrong people . Dreams die hard . Trevor said all they have to go on are some scars from an attempted suicide and a tattoo on her wrist . You know , a pretty little star . Right here . Your mother 's coming . All right , quick , hide this stuff . I need to talk to John . Alone . [ BIRD COOING ] Goodbye , bird . There 's a 51 percent chance I wouldn 't have killed you . [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] - Cameron-- - I know . I heard you . Riley 's dead . [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] Was it you ? Did you kill her ? What if I did ? Don 't play games with me . I need the truth . I didn 't kill her . - I wanna believe you . - Believe me . Sometimes you lie to me . Yes . I do , but I 'm not lying now . I am sorry . You 're sorry ? For what ? For your loss . I really wish I could believe that too . So are you gonna say anything ? Jesse ? - Thanks . - Thanks . For bailing me out . Thanks . I know you don 't like police stations . - Maybe that 's because I 'm a fugitive . - I know . - So thanks . - What happened ? I told you , I got in a fight . With four Naval aviators . Really just three . One of them went down pretty quick . What 's going on ? Nothing . I don 't believe you . I need to know what the hell 's going on . I told you , nothing . [ SIGHS ] - We across the line yet ? - Not yet . Give it a tick . Zero degrees north , heading south-southwest over the equator . Now we 've crossed the line . [ CHEERING ] - Whoo , whoo ! - Whoo ! One nice thing about metal driving the boat : A schedule 's a schedule . One nice thing . - That mean we 're done ? - Quiet , you . Proclamation . " Know ye that Sonarman Second Class Christopher Garvin on the 13th day of September , 2027 aboard USS Jimmy Carter , appeared at the equator at latitude zero , longitude 180 , entering into our royal domain and having been found worthy by my royal staff , was initiated into the Solemn Mysteries of the Ancient Order of the Deep . I command my subjects to honor him as one of our trusty shellbacks . " Now rise , shellback . [ CHUCKLING ] - Never gets old , does it ? - Never . [ RUMBLING ] Depth charge . General quarters . Go . Go ! [ ALARM BUZZING ] SAVANNAH : Boo ! - Come and play hide-and-seek , Mommy . - I 'm working . But you promised . Patience is a virtue , Savannah . To tolerate delay . It implies self-control and forbearance as opposed to wanting what we want when we want it . Something to think about . [ DOOR BUZZES ] [ " THREE BLIND MICE " PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] [ GIGGLES ] [ LAUGHING ] Would you like to play hide-and-seek ? Mr. Ellison . My daughter , Savannah she 's missing . She 's in the building , Mr. Ellison . We just have to find her . - It 's 23 stories . - Yes . And there 's someone who knows what 's going on on all of them . WEAVER : John Henry , we 're looking for my daughter , Savannah . - Have you seen her today ? - Yes , I have . - She wanted to play a game . - Where is she now ? She 's hiding . - Tell us where she 's hiding . - That 's not how the game works . How does the game work ? Hide-and-seek . There are many variations . The one we 're playing you guess what I 'm thinking , I give you a clue . Listen to me , John Henry . You 're gonna tell me where Savannah is . And you 're gonna tell me now . I 'm thinking of a country . Come again ? Let 's play the game . This is ridiculous . I 'm not gonna bargain with a computer . If I 'm not mistaken , Mr. Ellison we 've got no choice . You hit him in the mouth , didn 't you ? Never aim for the mouth . - What 's that ? - Antibiotic . You know , one time when Kyle and I were kids we , uh , saw two tunnel trolls go at it over a can of stewed tomatoes . The loser got three teeth knocked out , and the winner got a blood infection from his split knuckles and died a week later . The human mouth is filthy . [ PHONE RINGING ] You got that ? Yeah . What ? Damn . John okay ? All right . Hold tight . I 'm on my way . [ SIGHS ] John 's girlfriend is dead . Oh . A cyborg did it . - You know that for sure ? - Who else could it be ? What are you gonna do ? - About the metal ? - What are you gonna do ? Because you can 't kill her , Derek . - What ? - That 's not something you can do . He has to make that decision on his own . You 've really thought this through . No . But I think about it . Just like you do . More depth charges . Shook us up a bit , but no damage . They want us to make a mistake , reveal our position . A lot of metal in the water , captain . Barrage . Getting closer . - ASW bots . How many ? - Travel in packs . No way to tell . Mr. Garvin ? [ BEEPING ] Garvin . Not ASW bots . Oh , man , oh , man . Kraken . - We 've got a kraken . - You sure ? Bet my life on it . - Feed the sonar picture to Tactical . - Aye , ma 'am . You 're a big fellow , aren 't you ? And you 're very far from home . That can 't be right . - Where are we ? - Chief of the boat status of our torpedo stock ? Two , maybe three I 'd consider worth using in a fight . Ready Tube 1 . Hold for my order . Queeg , we can 't fight a kraken with one torpedo . Or three . We need to break contact and find a way around . Mr. Garvin , active sonar , please . One ping only . One ping , aye . [ SONAR PINGS ] Torpedo in the water . Closing fast , maybe 40 seconds . - Yes . Status on my torpedo ? - Torpedo ready , but- - Thirty-second fuse . Match our speed and bearing after breakaway . Fire . You heard him . Fire . [ WHOOSHING ] - Torpedo away . - Hostile closing , 55 knots . You got us 20 degrees down bubble . Ahead , full . Queeg , you 're taking- - Taking the boat to 729.8 meters . - Crush depth . - The edge of crush depth . The kraken won 't be able to follow . Their sonar will reflect off the thermocline layer . - We 'll be- - - Invisible . - We 're playing dead . - Eight seconds to torpedo contact . - Approaching crush depth . - If he 's off by even a millimeter ... - ... for even a fraction of a second- - - He won 't be . This is what he does . Two detonations . Our torpedo and theirs . Eleven hundred meters to starboard , 120 on the Z. And now we roll over , stick out our tongue , hold our breath . [ HULL CREAKING ] - Skipper , we 're at 729.8 . - I 'm aware , chief . Thank you . 729.8 and holding . You may return to your duty stations now . You heard the captain , people . What , you never been 20 centimeters from your maker before ? Move . Skipper , when we 're done skating over our deaths I got a question . Why are we 300 miles off course ? We were using it for research , to find out what makes them- - Don 't , John . Just don 't . Don 't make excuses for her . Don 't cover for her . - I knew about the parts- - - I 'm not talking about the parts . I 'm talking about Riley . Well , there 's nothing to talk about , is there ? Because Riley 's dead . How do you think that happened ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna figure it out , though . You know , John . We both know . No . Cameron didn 't do it . How can you say that ? How can you be sure ? Because I 'm sure , and I know her and she told me . She told you . Just like she told you she destroyed every part we ever captured . Just like she tells us what she does every night when we go to sleep . When she comes back in the morning , she 's covered in cuts and bruises . Hey . Just like she told you she loved you . You don 't know anything . I 'm thinking of an herb . - Tarragon ? - No . - We 're wasting time . - But it 's working , his game . What is wrong with you ? Why are you not angry ? Why should I be ? We have a way to get her back . Tell me where the child is . [ SIGHS ] Look , you asked me to teach him ethics , morals and rules . What good is it if he 's not gonna follow them ? He will , if we let him learn the rules on his own . Oregano . - Correct . - See there ? A lucky guess . - Lucky . - Give us our clue . The sun is shining on Savannah . Security . Check near all windows . Any place light is coming through . I 'm thinking of an animal . - Antelope . - No . - Lion . - No . - Horse . - No . - Bird . - Correct . - Give us our clue . - The answer is the clue . What ? What does that mean ? Just what he said . " Bird " is our clue . Bird . Bird . Bird . I know where she is . Security , meet us at the elevators . Savannah , are you okay ? Mm-hm . Come here , come here . Here , go to your mother . You found me , Mommy . Yes , darling , I did . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Hey , Aaron . John . I remember . - Is Riley around ? - No . She didn 't come home last night . Riley didn 't come home ? Thanks . Foster kids . That 's the way it is with them sometimes . They drift into your life , and then they drift back out again . Not always according to plan . She 's a tough one too . Good heart , as I 'm sure you know , but tough to know . Well , uh , I really needed to talk to her . I don 't know if you can maybe just take a message for me , or ... ? [ PHONE RINGING ] - See , the last time we spoke- - - Hang on a sec . Hello ? Riley . God , Riley , are you all right ? Where are you ? [ IN RILEY 'S VOICE ] Everything 's fine . I 'm in Riverside . It 's a long story . - Everything 's fine . - We 've been worried sick . - We were about to call the police . - Please don 't do that . Everything 's fine . - John too . He 's here . - John ? Really ? Can I talk to him ? Me ? Riley ? You 're in Riverside . Okay . Well , listen , we 'll talk when I see you . I thought you 'd wanna hear my voice . You know you 're really freaking everybody out , right ? Am I freaking you out now ? Yes ... - ... so let 's talk later . - I 'm sorry . It 's just- - I 've been thinking about my parents a lot and there are things I can 't get out of my head and I just thought if I came out and saw where we used to live ... . I know . Stupid , right ? Okay , well , we 'll talk about all this in person , yeah ? When you get back . - We 're hanging up now . Ha-ha . - John ? Yeah , sure . That would be great . - John ? - Yeah ? I love you . Okay , bye . - What was that about ? [ IN NORMAL VOICE ] What was what about ? What happened just now . It was the plan . No , the plan was to call the foster parents . The plan was to let him hear her voice . That 's what I did . That 's not all you did . What you did was not the plan . The plan was to make him think she 's still alive so he wouldn 't go to the police . You became part of that plan . Your reaction made it more authentic . Don 't you think it was more authentic that way ? Where are we going now ? We 're not going anywhere . I 'm going somewhere and I 'm gonna go alone . - You shouldn 't be alone . - Yes , I should . Did you have fun playing the game , Mr. Ellison ? - No , John Henry , I did not . - Why not ? Because what you did made me very , very angry . - I don 't understand . - You kept a secret . Is it wrong to keep a secret ? The secret you kept could 've harmed Savannah . What if we couldn 't have found her ? What if she 'd fallen from the roof and died ? Then she wouldn 't be alive anymore , and her life is important . Human life is sacred . If she had died , it would be your fault . My fault ? Because you were the only one who knew where she was and you made a choice not to tell . It was the wrong choice . Derek ? I 'm thinking about Riley . What the cyborg did to her . It 's a terrible thing . But if John realizes what the metal is what it really does maybe some good can come of it . Maybe you can help him see that . Good ? An innocent kid is dead . That metal bitch murdered her in cold blood . No good comes out of that . None . Not ever . You 're a good man . Oh , yeah ? Don 't let anyone tell you different . [ SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ SIGHS ] We 've been bearing 30 degrees off-course for four hours into a major Skynet zone . What 's going on ? Our new mission required it . What mission ? Where are we headed ? A deep-water oil platform near the Indonesian archipelago . Lieutenant Dietz and his team will board the rig and retrieve a package . We will deliver this package to Serrano Point . We have important cargo to take to Perth . Components , vaccines- - Our orders come from John Connor . These orders from John Connor , do they say what we 're after ? What it is ? Yes . They say what the package is . Right . Please inform the crew . Thank you . [ SIGHS ] JESSE : Just stay sharp . You 'll be fine . - Oh , I know I 'll be fine . [ GUN COCKS ] - I got this . - I 'm serious , Dietz . - I 'm always serious about being fine . - You do me one favor . You see anything you don 't like , you think before you pull that trigger . I 've been seeing things I don 't like since J-Day . You don 't get to be my age without thinking first . I swear , Mom . We 'll hold hands before we cross the street . ASDS has cut engines , commander . I think we 're clear for comms . ASDS , this is Carter , over . DIETZ : Hey , Mom . I 'll say this much about a deep-sea oil rig : Second-worst thing I 've ever smelled . Dark as night out here . We 're gonna keep this channel open . Maintain radio silence till you 've got the package . Planning on it . [ RAIN PATTERING ] [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] Connor sent me . John Connor . I 've come for that . That 's for him . I 'm just here to pick it up . [ METAL CLANKING ] [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] I had planned on waiting for you with Derek 's sniper rifle . Pulled the trigger , solved about 50 percent of my problems . One shot . Do you know how bad I 'd have felt ? - Very bad ? - Not bad at all . But I know someone who 'd have felt bad . Someone who would never forgive me if I 'd done that . I don 't know what to do with you . You know what the stakes are . You know why we 're here . You know what this means . And yet here I stand , burning what 's left of an endoskeleton ... - ... I thought we 'd burned months ago . - I needed spare parts . I don 't care what you need , because this is not about you . No , it 's not about me . It 's about John . You 're concerned for his safety . - You bet I am . - From Skynet . - From me . - Maybe . Maybe especially you . We 're all a threat . We 're all a threat to John . He worries about us . That makes him vulnerable . He cares . I am not John 's problem . John is John 's problem . Humans are the problem . There 's only one way for him to be safe . That 's to be alone . What kind of life is that ? John 's life , someday . I 'm sorry . [ ENGLISH SDH ]

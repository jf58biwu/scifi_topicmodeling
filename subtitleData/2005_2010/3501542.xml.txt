 Claire when you are ready to talk about it . You know I am here , right ? Yeah . I am so angry . to think that monster was in this house . Maybe we should go to motel . He is not coming back . How do you know that ? I think he got what he came for . You don 't have to give me any details , Claire . But I need to know ... Did he ... ? No . No , It wasn 't that . Claire I 'll get you a towel . I don 't feel anything . It 's getting hurt , there is no pain . But that 's your power , isn 't it ? No . I heal , but I always feel everything . It hurts as same as anyone else , but ... not this time . That pain ... I am always so grateful for . Because it 's the only time . I know I am still human . I had another dream . One I 'd rather not repeat . And all because you 're not where you 're supposed to be . So go back where you came from , Peter . I 'm sorry . I 'm a little too busy saving the world right now . You never were as smart as you thought you were . I see a few more years on this planet Hasn 't changed that . There are things that I know . Things that you can 't see , mother . Even in your dreams . I 've seen what you become . I 've seen what you do . So don 't think that I came back here for my health . You have no idea the fire that you 're playing with . You don 't screw with time . It 's called the butterfly effect . You step on a butterfly today . Three years from now , A million people are wiped out . Let 's just hope it 's nobody that I know . Oh , but what if it is ? What if it turns out to be someone you do know ? Someone you care about ? Claire . You talked to her today , didn 't you ? What 'd you tell her ? I told her not to go to Odessa . I told her to stay home . Why ? She listened to you . Ended up being where she wasn 't supposed to be , And had a pretty bad day because of it . Don 't believe me ? Go see for yourself . Dr. Suresh . Hello . Dr. Suresh ? Up here ! How did you- - I-i came to apologize about last night . I 'm sorry I was ... So , uh ... How did you just do that ? That serum I Made ? You know how I said it would give abilities To anyone instantaneously ? You didn 't . I sure did . But you said it still needed to be perfected . I was wrong . And the results have been beyond my wildest dreams . I woke up this morning And I 've never felt anything like it . I 've been cataloguing the whole experience , Monitoring my vitals . So ... It didn 't give you my abilities . Far from it . My senses are heightened . I 'm stronger , faster , more agile . I have boundless energy . I 'm a new Man . Watch this . I 've run a blood sample , checked reflexes , Hormone levels , blood pressure , Balance . They 're all normal . I am completely the same in every way . My god . It 's unbelievable . Just different . Better . And if I give powers to anyone , Then it 's only a Matter of time Before I figure out a way to reverse the effects . Take the powers away . Your powers . And this all came from you , Maya . From what 's inside that ... Extraordinary body of yours . You are different . Karina and Cruz were two of our best agents . Fine . I 'll own it , daddy . I screwed up . Sylar got away . And he got to Claire Bennet , Making him virtually unstoppable . I can stop him . You know , I can 't help but think about you as a child . When your mother died , your need for approval , Affection ... It was hard to bear . I will find him . And I 'll figure out where he 's gonna strike next- - No , no , no , why should I keep putting you Into a position where you 're just going to be Letting me or yourself down again , huh ? That 's not fair to either of us , is it ? Hiro . don 't do that Do what ? Sneak up on me I wasn 't sneaking up on you . You were definitely sneaking up on me Who are these guys ? Private Detectives . Very discrete . Expensive They found a fingerprint . Checking A.F.I.S Did you tell them it was from a woman who moves at super speed ? Of course not . Did you mention that she stole a piece of paper ... with a formula on it that could ... destroy the entire world ? At these prices they don 't ask a lot of questions . Her name is Daphne Millbrook . 14 Rue Saint-Jacques , Paris , France . I found her ! Now all I have to do is track her down You 're not taking me with you ? What did I do ? Nothing . Let 's go Please tell me you 're not getting cold feet . I know we wanted to Make a bold move , But Petrelli is a loaded gun . The seat 's been vacant for a month . Now as governor , it 's your job to fill it . Doug Hargis is a safer choice . Oh , Hargis is a stiff ! You 'd be better off Leaving Dickenson 's dead carcass in there . All right , if ... If we went with Petrelli , Do we really know what we 're buying ? Yeah . The future . Someone who would owe you a real debt In a very strategic place . He 's untested . Some say unbalanced . Well , he somehow got elected to congress From the most populous district in the state . And gave up his seat for personal reasons . Do you really think the press is gonna look the other way ? If we point ' em in the other direction , yeah . The Man was shot , died on the table , And lived to talk about it . Who does he credit with this little miracle ? God . God and politics . Risky bedfellows . Maybe so , but he is landing huge On every Major media outlet in the country . And the far right is loving him , Which fits in nicely with your priorities . Sure , they love him now . You don 't pay me for sex , governor . I give that for free . What you pay me for is my advice , And my advice to you is to appoint Nathan Petrelli The junior senator from the state of new york . But then again , like I said , It 's your call . We 're ready , sir . Reach out to him . My flight leaves in an hour . Ms. Strauss . The governor hasn 't Made his choice yet . Oh , no , this isn 't about filling the senate seat . This is about you . Me ? There 's no story with me . Oh , I don 't know . Las vegas stripper becomes K street ice queen . Big story . You 're kidding , right ? This isn 't something Some grammar school kid couldn 't do with a laptop . No , no , no , no , now I have my sources . They tell me this is you . Your sources are wrong . Why would someone like me do something like that ? That 's exactly what I want to know . I 'm running this story with or without your comment . You run this story , And I will hunt your ass down and destroy you . A thief lives here ? So it would appear It seemed to help last time I Made a tape . But this time it 's different , Because I 'm starting to wonder If I 'm even human anymore . Because if you can 't feel anything , Do you still have a soul ? Will I live forever ? All of these questions , I just- - I need to prove that I 'm still alive . So I guess I should just start by saying My name is Claire Bennet , And this is attempt number seven . What are you doing ? What were you doing ? What does it look like ? Trying to get hit by a train . Just ... I just needed to feel something . Hey , what happened to you ? Something awful . And left me there . He can heal now . Yes . I saw it . That wasn 't supposed to happen . What ? And what did he mean I was special ? Different . What was he talking about ? What happened to you Never should 've happened , Claire . It 's my fault . You can 't save me all the time , Peter . What happened was my fault . I can 't defend myself . Yeah , I can heal , But what kind of lame power is that ? I 'm still just a victim . You could teach me . You learned how to use your power and you fought him . Claire- - you could help me do that . I can 't ! Not me , not now . Why not ? I don 't understand . Because something could go wrong And it changes everything . I need someone to help me . It can 't be me , Claire . I have to be very careful what I say to you . Why ? I 'm sorry . I have to go . For the salvation of my soul , Give me true contrition That I May day and night By penance Make satisfaction for my Many sins . Speaking of sin . I 'm sorry , the nurse said That it would be okay if I stopped by . Yeah , no , it 's fine . I was just- - I 'm sorry , I 'm a little bit surprised . What are you doing here ? You 're right . I should 've phoned . But I have quite a proposition For you , congressman . A proposition for me ? No , thanks . I 'm here on behalf of governor Malden . You work for Malden . I 'm an advisor to the governor , And we both agree that you would Make An excellent choice to fill the seat Left by Gerald Dickenson 's untimely death . Niki , it 's me . What the hell are you talking about ? Did you just call me Niki ? Yeah , Niki . Come on , cut the crap . Wait , do you think that you know me ? The word " biblically " comes to mind . Niki , Niki Sanders . We met in vegas . Had a pretty good time , if I recall . I think you have me mistaken For another woman , congressman . My name is Tracy Strauss . You 're not Niki Sanders ? Not in the slightest . And you 're an advisor for the governor 's office . You can check me out if you 'd like . Okay . And the offer . The governor wants you , mr . Petrelli . United states senator . Think about it . My cell number 's on the back . Interesting Meeting ? You . You put Niki up to this ? That woman is not Niki Sanders . That 's Tracy Strauss , just like she said . And the offer that she Made was quite legitimate . That 's impossible . That woman was Niki Sanders . Perhaps there 's a reason for that . Someone so familiar-looking Offering you the chance of a lifetime . You should think about that , Nathan . This is god 's plan . You don 't know the first thing about god 's plan . Get out . Nathan , i- - I need my sleep . Dad , I 've been thinking about it . We don 't need to look for Sylar . He 's on the hunt for powers . On level five , he 'd have an all-you-can-eat buffet . Are you even listening to me ? Do you know , you are so sure That I 'm gonna disappoint you , But when I prove you wrong- - Hey , you come to see me , baby , or what ? Screw you ! Elle , it 's me ! Peter Petrelli ! You 've gotta let me out . Please ! Let me out of here . Sylar 's in the building . Let 's go . Daddy doesn 't want me to leave my cell . My dad 's dead . Sylar killed him . Hello , Noah . Did you miss me ? I got that from your Claire . You son of bitch ! Sylar ! You bastard ! Leave her alone ! Sylar ! Look what your daddy used to be able to do . You killed him . I 've killed a lot of people , Elle . You 're as much to blame for that as anyone . Maybe even more so . Elle , it 's me , Peter . You okay ? Jesse , come on . We gotta go before they lock us back up . Where we going , Man ? What 's the plan ? All this stuff ... With super-speed , she is the world 's greatest thief . But where 's the formula ? Huh , figures . I 've never been to France before . I wanted a souvenir . And what 's that supposed to mean ? " figures . " You 're treating me like some kind of criminal . Tell me . When I went to the future , I saw you . You saw me ? The Future You . And ? And you were a villain . You killed me . Killed you ? But ... I am not a villain . I am your best friend . Today Maybe . What about tomorrow ? It wasn 't me . It was a robot or something . someone who could change their appearance to look like me . Hey , you asked , I told you . We need to set a trap . That 's what Batman always does with Catwoman . A ransom . Catwoman ? Now , what treasure ... does the world 's fastest thief hold most dear ? " First place , hundred yard dash , twelfth grade . " How are you feeling ? Conflicted . I 've been asked to fill the seat Left by senator Dickenson . That 's incredible . Last time I was in a position of authority , I nearly let Manhattan Get wiped off the face of the Map . I 'm not really sure what that says About my basic nature . You 're different now . Everything 's ... Different . Which is what I came here to talk to you about . I need to show you something . I 'm from the future , Nathan . I came back to kill you . I was the one who shot you . I 've lived for years In a world where people like us have been hunted , Slaughtered , used , All because of what you told the world At that press conference . I had to stop that from happening . I 'm not sure how I 'm supposed to respond to this . I came here to save the world , But I don 't think that I have . You sure as hell stopped me from telling everyone . I know , but the future is different now . I 've changed everything . That 's what I 'm trying to say . Why are you telling me this ? I need your forgiveness . If you 're from the future , then ... What do I do next ? Do I take the offer ? Do I become a senator ? You had a different future where I came from , But I stopped that . Now you 're on the path to being the brother That I always looked up to . You 're gonna Make the right choices . Where are you going ? To set things right . Tracy Strauss . Hi , it 's Nathan Petrelli . Listen , I 've , uh , I 've given t a lot of thought , And I 've decided . I 'd be honored to serve As junior senator from new york . The governor will be very pleased . But it 's on one condition . I want you on my staff . I 'm not going into this without an ally . If that 's what it takes . We 'll Make an announcement At the press conference tomorrow . The whole dog and pony . I assume you 're well enough . I 'll be fine . Gotta run . Expect a call shortly . Congratulations , senator Petrelli . Hey , story runs tomorrow . Sure you don 't want to Make a comment ? I turn it in in 15 minutes . That would be a serious mistake . This woman in las vegas , Niki Sanders , Looks like me . She 's not me . Is that all you 've got ? You want to tell me that 's not you , huh ? I got this from a friend of mine Who works in security At the corinthian hotel in las vegas . Now that is you . And if I 'm not mistaken , That 's congressman Nathan Petrelli , Rumored to be governor Malden 's choice For Dickenson 's senate seat . Comment ? It 's not me . You know , I was thinking about running with something like " K street ice queen heats up las vegas Sleeping with a senator and a congressman . " You can 't run this story . Hey . No ! Quite a little mess you 've Made here . Mrs. Petrelli ? What are you doing here ? With your father 's death , The chain of command falls to me . My father 's body isn 't even cold yet . This is how things work around here , Elle . You should know that . And I 'm starting by Making a few changes . I--we caught Sylar . Good for you ! Your electrical outburst also shut down the grid , Letting out a dozen inmates Who are just as bad or worse . And Noah Bennet is gone too . I know . And I 'm gonna get right on that . No , actually , you won 't . I 'm sorry ? We only kept you around this long At your father 's insistence . He 's been protecting you for a long time . And circumstances have obviously changed , And we won 't be needing your services anymore . But ... I have worked for this company my entire life . What am I supposed to do now ? I suppose you 'll have to get yourself another life . You understand your part of the plan , right ? It sounds dangerous . Does Batman put Robin in danger ... when he sets a trap for catwoman ? Sometimes . To teach him a lesson . Stop punishing me for something I haven 't done yet Don 't kill me and I won 't punish you . I 'm not going to kill you ! What are you doing here ? You have something of mine , And now I have something of yours . All right , time warp , give it back . You are not faster than me , nemesis . Oh , yeah ? Here , kitty-kitty ! I am offering you a trade . All right . But my boss isn 't gonna be very happy about this . Your boss ? You didn 't look behind the Mona Lisa ?

You can 't stop me . I 'm taking them both . I can 't let you do that . That formula could destroy the whole world . Is it worth the sacrifice of your friend ? No , stop ! Did you do this ? Did you cut me ? No ! It was her ! She 's the villain . She cut you . And you let her ! Don 't worry , the plan is solid . You mean the one that just failed ? I put a tracking device under the ribbon of the medallion . When ? I didn 't see you do that ? I stop time and teleport . I do Many things that you don 't see . Why didn 't you tell me the whole plan ? Because I didn 't trust you . Enough , Hiro ! I 'm just Ando . I 've got her ! We 'll get the other half of the formula before she does . Come on , Ando . The game is afoot ! What 's happening to me ? Oh , god , I 'm going insane . That plant there . It will give you water . Oh ! Thank you , turtle ! You saved my life .

You Made the right choice , my boy . Taking your rook ? Taking the senate seat . It 's gonna be different this time . I 'm not gonna let you Manipulate me . I 'm the one Making the decisions . I 'm the one in control . Of course you are . Mr. Petrelli , it 's late . You need your rest . Can 't you see I 'm in the middle Of a heated game ? You 're playing yourself ? I 'm obviously playing mister- - She can 't see me , Nathan . No one can . Except you . Did I not mention that ? Now , whose turn was it again ? Some people are just evil . That 's their nature . His name is Knox . He can absorb a person 's fear And turn it into his own strength , Incredible strength . This guy is a flame thrower . We call this guy the German . He can control Magnetic energy . And this guy , Jesse . You don 't want to know . Let 's just say they could destroy us all . You know , even before you were ever born , I 've been finding these people And locking them away so they can 't do any harm . And now a dozen of them have escaped . They 're out there . And they will kill , and they will terrorize , And they will conspire , And they will cause unimaginable destruction To the world . They 're villains , Claire . And right now I 'm one of the only people On the planet that knows enough to stop them . That 's why I can 't stay . Then let me come with you . I can be your partner . Claire- - I can help . I helped save new york city ! You were there . You saw it . I was willing to shoot Peter with your gun When you couldn 't do it . That 's exactly the kind of situation I can 't put you in again . I am doing this so you don 't have to . And what if somebody comes here ? What if somebody comes after me and mom and Lyle ? I 've thought about that . And I 've called someone to help out while I 'm gone . What 's going on ? You have a lot of questions , Claire . As adoptive parents there 's only so Many we can answer . Mom ? She 's here to Make sure you all stay safe . You 're in good hands . Sylar . What are you doing here ? Where is he ? Where 'd they go ? Escaped . That 's not possible . That never happened . It 's the butterfly effect , Peter . Just like I told you . I put him here to keep him safe . I put him in the body of the guy in that cell Right there ! Jesse ? ! You 're gonna figure out where my son is And you 're gonna bring him back here . You understand me ? And then go the hell back where you came from ! This is Nathan Petrelli . Leave a message . Nathan , I don 't even know if you 're alive or not . But if you get this , you need to look out For someone who looks just like me . He 's got a scar on his face , And I think it 's me from the fut- - Come on . Our ride is here . What are you doing ? Just having a little fun , that 's all . You coming ? It 's now or never . My sons have been such a disappointment . But you , I can give you What all boys crave from their mothers . Inspiration And guidance . Comfort . Isn 't that right , Gabriel ? My name is Sylar . And you are not my mother . But I am , dear .

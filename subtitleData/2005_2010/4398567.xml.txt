 Man , this lake is really startin ' to freak me out . You know how many people have disappeared from here in the last couple of years ? Maybe two . But do you know how many people have disappeared just in the last six months ? Huh ? Five . Man , you are paranoid . You should really lay off the green . Or at least share some with me . All right , I 'm done . Let 's get the hell out of here . Slow down . Let me finish getting my samples . You gotta relax . You need a hobby . You should try golf . Τillman , why are you even here ? You 're more concerned with baseball and mullets than you are with the ecosystem . For your information , I got into this line of work ... so I could meet sexy eco-warrior chicks who don 't shave their legs . [ Screams ] [ Gasping ] Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Help me ! [ Grunting ] Help me ! Help me ! Τillman ! Tillman ! Tillman ! Τillman ! Tillman ! Good mornin ' , sunshine . So are we havin ' fun yet ? Yeah , tons . Are you kidding me ? This is the boredom capital of the universe . Look , Scott , you 're stuck with me for a month , so why don 't you at least try and have a good time , huh ? You don 't even have cable or high-speed Internet . My cell phone doesn 't even work out here . A lot of people would think that was a good thing , Scott . Yeah , unlike your nasty meat loaf pie . Since you 're so determined to be miserable out here , why 'd you decide to come along in the first place ? It 's called a custody agreement , Sheriff . Listen , I wanna get something straight with you right off the bat , Son . You might be able to talk to your little friends that way , but I 'm not one of your little friends , and I 'm not your peer . I 'm your father , so I demand respect . Whatever . [ Man On Radio ] Sheriff Riley , come in . Go for Riley . Sheriff , that E.P.A. guy is here again . Says his partner 's gone missing on the lake . Over . [ Riley ] Mills ? He probably smoked a bad bowl and forgot he was all by himself . I 'll be there in a few minutes . I gotta go in to work . But afterwards , I 'll stop by and grab you . [ Barking ] We 'll go into town and catch a movie , huh ? Yeah , maybe . So why don 't you talk to her already ? Jesus , Dad . Don 't you gotta go to work or something ? Yes . So why don 't you talk to her already ? I 'll talk to her when I wanna talk to her . If you 're so excited about it , why don 't you go talk to her ? Be careful what you wish for . [ Engine Starts ] [ Chuckles ] Hey ! Can I speak to you for a minute ? Hi . How are you ? [ Chuckling ] Sure . Okay . Oh , this is not happening . Mornin ' . Good morning , Sheriff . Miner , you crazy sneakin ' up on somebody like that ? Hey , that 's my job . Yeah , well , excuse me while I go do mine . You know , I heard someone else has gone missing on the lake . How many does that make now , Sheriff ? Is there a possible serial killer on the loose ? Wild animal ? Maybe an Αl-Qaeda jihad ? Care to comment ? Yeah , I care to comment . You write anything in that newspaper of yours that sends my town into a panic , I 'll be looking for you at the bottom of that lake . You can quote me on that . You 're a guard dog . Guard ! Who buys your bones ? Can somebody please explain to me why the local gossip has to be breathing down my neck ? Hello , Frank . There 's enough goin ' on around here ... without havin ' to deal with that moron . I told that dirty rotten snoop Cal Miner to get the heck out of here . He just started yammering ' on about freedom of the press or some such . - You should just shoot him , Sheriff . - If it were only that easy . There you go , makin ' things too complicated again . Could we make an exception in Cal 's case ? Dale , do not tempt me . Sheriff , listen . Hey , Frank , how 's it goin ' ? Good , good . No , no , not that great , you know ? Yeah , I heard about that . Why don 't you , uh , fill us all in . [ Frank ] Okay . Well , my partner and I are workin ' on the lake , and , uh - Well , the next thing I know , he 's in the water . Just like that ? Yeah . I 'm tryin ' to get him back in the boat , and he 's screamin ' and yellin ' , and somethin pulls him under . He 's gone , Sheriff . [ Riley ] I 'm a little unclear on something here . How exactly did he wind up in the water in the first place ? Uh , pretty sure he fell off leaning ' over the side . Frank , I got a question for you . Did you , by any chance , eat any organic brownies this morning ? [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] That 's gotta be it . You think this is just a joke , huh , Sheriff ? Come with me , and I 'll show you the punch line . Okay , Frank . I got a feelin I 'm not gonna like what 's under that sheet . Ah ! Wow . So these are your friend , huh ? Used to be . Whatever 's in your lake took the rest of him . I gotta call Fish and Wildlife right away . Cover that up , Charlie . [ Woman ] We 've already been called . [ Riley Chuckles ] Well , gentlemen , isn 't this just ducky ? Look , James , if it 's any consolation , I asked them to send someone else . I appreciate your concern , Emma , but I 'm a professional . I can handle it . It 's just that I hadn 't heard from you in so damn long . I sent you an e-mail . You sent me a group e-mail about some PETA rally . How personal is that ? Honestly , I didn 't think you were quite over your ex-wife . Oh , now , just what the hell is that supposed to mean ? - I hate to break up couple therapy . - Oh ! But I 'm not Dr. Phil , and this sure as hell ain 't Oprah ! It 's not a toy , Frank ! Emma ? Look what you did ! Are you happy ? I 'm so embarrassed . Always had a weak stomach for blood . It 's a good thing you weren 't out on the lake . Boy , it was awful . Pulled him under so quickly . Here . So strong . Something that vicious , Frank , it had to be a mountain lion , a sick bear or something like that . The chances of a mammal killing someone on a lake that deep are about a billion to one . About as good as our chances of finding out on this porch . Think you can handle going back to the lake , Frank ? Yeah , sure . Let 's do it . Okay . I have a boat . Let 's go ! [ James ] Frank , we 've been over the same area four times . You sure this is where Τillman went under ? I think so . You think so ? I didn 't know anyone lived on this side of the lake . That 's " Crazy " Sadie Bickerman . She moved into that place a couple years after her sister went missing . The way I hear it , she , uh , used to feed live cattle ... to a couple of 40-foot prehistoric crocs she kept in her backyard . [ Emma Chuckles ] What ? That 's ridiculous . That 's the kind of detail you could 've shared with us back at the morgue . Mills , come on . You know everybody around here 's prone to exaggeration , if you get my drift . And crocodiles don 't live as far north as Maine , Frank . If there really was one up here , I 'm sure it would 've been a newsworthy occurrence . Maybe . But that 's not the kind of thing ... a lake town would want featured on its tourism brochure . Slow down . Over there . What is that ? I don 't know . I 'm pullin ' in , see if I can 't fish it out . [ Grunts ] Let 's see here . Come here . [ Grunts ] Just a second . We 'll get there . Whoa ! What are you doin ' ? It 's not like you haven 't seen all this before . We can wait around here all day , or I can jump in and see what it is . Turn around . Turn around ! So you 're just gonna jump in ? You 're not even gonna let - Yeah , I 'm goin ' in . [ Chuckles ] You never changed . Turn around ! What , do you think a 40-foot croc 's gonna get me ? There 's always hope . [ Laughs ] What is that ? - Whoa ! - [ Gasping ] Τillman ? Oh , it used to be . Emma , you get out of there right now . Come on ! Come on . Come on . Up you go . There you go . There you go . Careful . All right , Emma . Come on . [ Panting ] Now do you believe it 's a giant crocodile ? [ Emma ] Doesn 't mean anything , Frank . It 's just another piece of the puzzle . Piece of the puzzle ? We got his foot , we got his arm , and now we got his head ! What other pieces do you need ? Mills , shut up ! You 're not being any help . We 're all on the same team here . Come on . Let 's go talk to ... Crazy Sadie . ♪ I know I 'm gonna make mistakes ♪ ♪ ♪ [ Continues ] All right . We finally made it . That was some shortcut , genius . Hey , we made it , didn 't we ?

You are right about the " old " part though . Why don 't you let me talk to her ? Be my guest , Emma . All right . [ Knocking ] [ Knocking Continues ] Hi . Mrs. Sadie Bickerman ? I 'm Emma Warner from Fish and Wildlife , and I 'm so sorry to bother you , but I was just wondering , can we come in and ask you a few questions ? Fish and Wildlife ? Mm-hmm . Hasn 't been a lick of livestock on this property since I lost my sister . Unless you got some answers for me on that , why in the world would I wanna talk to you jerks ? [ Door Slams Shut ] Oh . Um - I didn 't know . What ? I 'm - I 'm sorry . Can we just come in for a minute ? We won 't be long . You 're right . You won 't . [ Chuckles ] Wow . You 're great with the elderly . You wanna try ? Be my guest . This is Sheriff Riley , Sadie . Open up . I 'm sorry . Wasn 't I clear enough , Sheriff ? Sadie , we found a man 's head about 200 yards off your dock . Wanted to know if you had any information about it . I 'm an old lady . Unless you think I chopped off some poor sap 's melon - [ Chuckling ] I don 't know how I can help . You can start by telling us anything you know about any crocodiles ... wandering into the freshwater of our lake . I understand that your sister had quite a history with crocs . Don 't you mention my sister . I don 't know squat . Till you get yourself a warrant , you can go piss up a rope , Columbo ! - That was great . - Get lost , Barney Miller ! Crazy Sadie knows something , I can feel it . Well , she 's right . We can 't search her place without a warrant . Yeah , but she can 't stop us from searching the lake . ♪ ♪ [ Rock On Radio ] [ Both Giggling ] Ouch ! [ Groans ] What 's wrong ? Uh , nothin ' . I 'm just really hot .

No , no , no . He 's just - Ignore him . It 's - You okay ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm cool . You 're far from cool , buddy . Shut up , Thad . Scott , this is Thad . Look like you almost wet your pants there , pal . Trust me , nothing in this Podunk town 's gonna make me wet my pants . Oh , yeah ? Where are you from ? I live in Newton just outside of Boston with my mom . Oh , I love Boston . I just got accepted to B.C. But I haven 't decided if I 'm gonna go there or Northeastern , so - I think she should stay someplace close to home . Yeah , well , it 's not really your decision . Uh , Boston is awesome . I mean , I wish I could 've stayed there for the summer , but - You know , since my folks split , my dad thought I should come up here . Scott 's dad is Sheriff Riley . No way ! Doesn 't that gay-ass have anything better to do than bust up all our parties ? No , don 't worry . I know he 's a buzz kill . A bunch of us are gonna go hike over the other side of the lake . Camp overnight . If you wanna come , you 're more than welcome . Uh , sure . Definitely . Baby , when did you become chairman of the welcoming committee ? Don 't be a jerk , okay ? The least we can do is show him ... that we 're not a bunch of hicks around here . You got any more beers in your bag , or is your daddy gonna arrest us ? I 'm not worried about it . Okay , great . It 's settled . So let 's go meet up with Rachel and Larry . We 'll grab our gear . [ Barking ] Daisy . [ Sadie ] Gosh . So many visitors this time of day , you 'd think this old lady was running a brothel . Oh , come on now . Sexy at 70 is what I 'd say . Well , aren 't you the charmer ? It 's true . You have very beautiful eyes , and eyes have no age . Now , Mrs. Bickerman - Oh , call me Sadie . Well then , now , Sadie , let 's start right at the beginning , and you tell me everything those folks said . Oh , there those little rascals go . They get riled up this time of day . That reminds me . I promised I 'd make you a snack . Oh , no , don 't worry . I 'm fine . I just have a few questions . Just sit right there . Be back in a jiffy . I 'm not really hungry , Sadie . Who said anything about it being your snack ? What 's that ? Out ! Get out closer to the edge . You 'll get a much better shot . [ Shutter Clicking ] What the hell is that ? [ Screams ] Ηuh . Guess he really wasn 't hungry . So what now , James ? We drag the lake , see if we can 't find the rest of his friend . You think you 're gonna find him , huh ?

Get out of there . Come on . [ Frank Yelling ] [ Laughing ] You 're being - Right up here . All right , all right . Frank ! Oh ! Get Mills a towel , would ya ? Come on . Get up . Frank , you 're being ridiculous . I 'm telling you , a local gossip and a superstitious old lady ... still don 't make a giant , man-eating crocodile . What ? [ James ] Emma ! Emma , swim to me now ! [ Growling ] [ Gasping ] Come on ! Can you swim ? Yeah . Swim . Come on ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Hurry up ! Come on ! Let 's go ! There it is ! No crocodiles in Maine , huh ? That 's gotta be the biggest animal I 've ever seen . [ Frank ] Great . Tourists . It 's not a tourist . How well do you know this guy ? I caught him poaching some endangered bobcats a couple years back ... up near the Canadian border . Just a typical greedy industrialist . Only this one fancies himself a great white hunter . His ego 's twice as big as that crocodile . Hi . [ Sighs ] Emma . [ Chuckles ] Never fancied you for the wet Τ-shirt type . [ Snickering ] Good to see our tax dollars hard at work . What are you doing here , Struthers ? Well , I got a tip from a local there might be somethin worth killing ' in this lake . The tip didn 't happen to come from a local weasel by the name of Cal Miner , did it ? Perhaps you should be grateful to that weasel . From the looks of things , the cavalry got here just in the nick of time . Tell you what . You can park your plane there for $ 40 a day . We don 't take Visa , we don 't take MasterCard . Oh , by the way , Emma , did you get them bobcat kabobs I sent you ? Oh ! [ Chuckles ] She likes me . Yeah . Are we close yet ? 'Cause my feet are totally killing me .

[ Thad ] Uh , Larry 's already pitching a tent . [ Kerri ] Yeah , I can tell by the way you guys are wrestling around in the water . - Uh , no , baby . This is all for you , sweetheart . - You 're a pig . So , come on , Scott . What do you say ? Comin ' in ? Uh - No , I 'm - I 'm not in the mood . Afraid you 're gonna get your hair wet ? No , I 'm just not a big fan of the water . He can keep me company . Come on , baby ! Whoo-hoo ! Um - [ Thad ] Hey , come on , man ! I 'm gonna go for a walk , check things out a little bit . [ Rachel ] Suit yourself . Hey , Sheriff . Thanks for comin ' out so quick , Dale . I brought exactly what you told me to . Heck of a lot of heat in this puppy . What are you plannin ' on , uh , blowin ' , uh - What is all this then ? Oh . We gotta have a talk . Huh . This thing really work ? Dale . Unload the boat . You know what , Ahmad ? I think I 'd like it better if the flap of the tent was facing east . That way , I get a good view of the mornin ' sunrise . Actually , boss , you don 't want the opening facing uphill in case it rains . No , it 's all right . Do it my way . Struthers , we 've decided to close the lake . That means no camping . Of course , you and your little pal there ... are always welcome to check into any one of our lovely B and B 's in town . You 're not gonna run us into jail now , are you , Sheriff ? I mean , it 'd be a terrific waste of manpower , especially when you got this giant crocodile on the loose . Why don 't you just get out of here ? I 'm sure there are a bunch of unemployed 10-year-olds in Asia you could be exploiting . Come on now , Emma . You 're not still holdin ' a grudge about them silly bobcats , are you ? There were 148 of those silly bobcats left on the entire planet . Now there are 146 , thanks to you . Can you leave it go ? I paid the fines . Everything 's not all about the bottom line . Well , then the bottom line is if I didn 't come along at the time I did , you 'd still be an endangered species . I hope you didn 't think you could just fly in here and kill an animal ... that may very well be the last remaining one of its kind . Well , of course I can . Isn 't that right , Sheriff ? [ James Sighs ] Afraid it 's not my call . It 's Emma 's jurisdiction . All I can do is ask you to show me permits for all the firepower you brought along . Ahmad has all the paperwork you need . Good . That 's great . You 're not gonna be able to use it . We 're doing this the humane way . We 're gonna trap it and bring it in alive . Do you wanna help me ? Well , that 's brilliant . I can see us all holding hands ... in the belly of the beast singing Give Peace a Chance . [ Emma ] Oh , please , shut up ! I think she really likes me , Ahmad . Whoa ! [ Sighs ] Damn it ! What the f - [ Rustling ] " Crocodiles bite down into the flesh of a victim ... " and roll over and over until the disoriented prey drowns or bleeds to death . It 's called a ' death roll . " ' Sounds like something to avoid . Oh , yeah . Well , you know , they 're perfect killing ' machines . And get this . " It wedges the body of its victim ... into an underwater pantry for future consumption . " Well , when we 're through here , we 'll have plenty of crocodile steaks in our pantry , eh ? Boots and belts too . [ Chuckles ] I got a question for the two of youse . Let me ask you this , geniuses . What are you plannin on usin ' for bait ? [ Sighs ] Sorry about this , baby . [ Frank ] You 're kidding . That 's your bait ? Come on . [ Grunts ] There 's no way this is gonna work . Come on , Dale . Crocodiles eat turtles . Looked it up in Struthers 's book . Get in there . He 's one heck of a turtle . I don 't like this plan . They growed up in a hole like this . Dale , would you be quiet ? Well , now , that is absolutely brilliant . You do realize the thing has eaten a human being , don 't you ? That 's right . Get in there , Struthers . Suppose you 'd prefer if we just lobbed in a land mine ? Nah , it 's way too messy . Besides , where 's the sport in that ? [ Rope Swishing ] [ Groans ] [ Pig Squealing ] Oh ! Anybody keeping ' kosher ? No , no , no , no ! Don 't even think about it . Struthers ! Can you help me get this thing out of here before it hurts itself ? We 'll get it . Dale , hand me - hand me the stick . Dale ! Just - Thank you . Just be careful . Don 't hurt it . Yeah , I - I won 't . All right . Let 's see . One . Can you reach it ? No . And two . One more . It 's okay . Ready ? [ Growling ] - Dale , hand me the tranq gun . - Yes , sir . Come on ! Tranq gun , right now ! You can 't just spray and pray . You gotta know what you 're shootin ' at . [ Growling Continues ] [ Growling Stops ] I think you got him , Sheriff . Whew ! What now ? [ Growling ] [ Both Gasp ] [ All Gasping ] Wait ! Stop ! You killed it ! No , I think the tranquilizer 's just taken effect . Come on . Let 's tie up its snout . I don 't think we 'll have much time . Let me do that . It 's okay . I got it . This here 's man 's work , sweetheart . Okay . Dale , be careful . Don 't worry , sir . I got it covered . This here 's what we call a four-point granny . [ Chuckles ] I learned it in the Boy Scouts . Not so tough now , are ya ? Whoa ! Hot damn ! [ Screams ] [ Screaming ] Oh ! [ Screaming Continues ] Well , so much for the humane thing . Now it 's my turn . Me first . Mine 's bigger . It 's all in how you use it . So what do you say now , Miss Warner ? You still wanna make friends with it ? Ah . Thought you 'd come around sooner or later . Too bad for your friends it was later . What do you say , Ahmad ? Let 's strap up and go kill us a croc . I thought you knew what you were doing . I do know what I 'm doing ... if you would just let me do it . Well , figure it out . [ Thad ] Get the one over there . [ Chuckling ] Oh , baby . Hey , sweetheart . Please don 't burn my fun bags . Larry , don 't be such a stupid American . All the beaches in Europe are topless . We are so going there . Yes , we are . Guys , come quick . Seriously , you guys gotta come check this out . Scott , what is it ? Just come on ! [ Rachel ] I 'm over nature time . Have a ball . I 'll go with you . Well , I 'm comin ' too then . Don 't mind me , guys . I 'm gonna make sure ... my little monkeys there don 't get toasty . Would you believe me if I told you I 'm completely rich ? Filthy ? [ James ] Where 'd you find - Ahmad , is it ? Yeah , me one-man army . In the Sudan , I was on safari . Heard about this lion that was terrorizing a small village . Killed 16 natives . I went looking for it , but I couldn 't find anything for two weeks . Then one night , I hear this wild screaming from the brush . Ahmad had found it gnawing on his mother 's throat . And even though he was barely a teenager , he jumped on it with his bare hands . Put up a hell of a fight . So that 's where he got the scars , huh ? I don 't suppose there 's any unsolved crime in your town , is there , Sheriff ? I don 't suppose there 's any more to your story , is there ? Afraid so . All right . Anyhow , I heard the commotion . I run on in and kill the beast , and Ahmad 's been with me ever since . He comes in very handy when there 's a bit of dirty work to be done . Sounds to me like you 're taking advantage of the situation . All set , boss . There it is . I 've never seen anything like it before . What is it , girls ' panties ? [ Chuckles ] Funny stuff . You should take your act on the road . Maybe open up for Jeff Foxworthy . I wish . That guy 's hilarious . So , where is it ? It 's right there . Holy shit ! It 's creepy . It looks like a grave or something . Totally . Let 's check it out up close . Uh , I think that 's a bad idea . Yeah , Thad , I agree . I think we should get out of here . You both do what you want . I 'm checkin ' it out . Come on , you sissies . Franchi , SPAS12 . Sporting purpose automatic shotgun . SPAS12 . That 's what they call an acronym . I know what an acronym is , Struthers . You never cease to amaze me , Sheriff . [ Chuckles ] Anyway , I dropped a black bear in Montana with this . Six rounds at close range , and it fell like a sack of ... nails . You know , I never quite understood the whole " sport of the hunting " thing . I prefer sports where my opponent knows they 're playing . Ah . That 's a nice gun . What the heck is that ? This , my friend , is a Milkor MGL-140 grenade launcher . Hit point targets from 200 feet , area targets from 400 , and it doesn 't matter whether you 're drunk or sober . After seeing what we 're up against , that little baby just might come in handy . Oh , yeah . Here . Emma . Hey . You all right ? You gotta snap out of it , girl . You made a call . You did what you thought was right . I killed them . Sure , they 're - they 're dead . They got chewed up into little pieces . But they knew what was going on when they went in . They chose to do it anyway . Come on . It 's not your fault . Look , the important thing right now ... is that we stop this thing before it kills either one of us . Right ? It wouldn 't be a bad idea to make sure that ... Struthers and his pal don 't destroy this entire lake in the process . There 's still some good fish in this lake . [ Chuckles ] Come on . [ Chuckles ] Dumb dog . [ Rachel ] I told you to stay away from my feet , Larry ! You freakin ' perv . Rachel , that 's not me ! [ Snorting ] [ Screaming ] - No ! No ! - [ Roaring ] [ Screams ] Larry ! Larry ! - Help me ! - I 'm trying ! [ Screaming ] - Oh , my God ! Oh ! - [ Screaming Continues ] Rachel , I 'm sorry ! [ Panting ] Help ! Help ! [ Panting ] Did you two have a nice , romantic walk ? You have to get my boat that bloody ? You want your crocodile dead , you let Ahmad do what he does best . He learned from the best . I 've already got one mangled boat to account for , not to mention a deputy 's family I 've gotta deliver some bad news to . Tell you what . I 'll pay the damages to your boat . As to your deputy , well , that 's your problem . I 'll tell you what . I 'm responsible for that boat , so I 'm gonna drive it . Don 't touch it . Whatever you say , Sheriff . Just stay out of Ahmad 's way . You about ready ? I 'd love to get this over with tonight ... so we can fly out of this dump . Don 't know , boss . Something about this one doesn 't seem right . We will not leave this place . Ahmad , come on now . You must be jokin ' . We 've been in a hell of a lot worse places than this . Remember them hammerheads down in Ecuador ? Or those snakeheads in - What was that miserable place ? Baltimore . This is different . Real big , real smart , fast on water and on land . Well , we just bring it to the surface , let it wear itself out , and bring the plane in . We get one clean kill shot , and it 's over . We 'll be fine . Here . [ Chuckles ] What do you think built this thing ? Probably a witch . Wait , don 't turn around . She 's right behind you . Shut up , stupid . [ Laughs ] Shut up , Thad . [ Laughing ] There 's a bunch more in there . They look like ... eggs of some kind . Maybe you should put ' em back . You 're crazy . I 've never seen an egg like this . No , maybe he 's right . Maybe we should put ' em back . Kerri , put it back , please . Okay , what kind of egg is it , smart guy ? A chicken . I-I don 't know . A lizard or a snake or something . Thad , don 't ! Yeah . Not smart . Wait . I think I know what kind of egg it is . Scrambled . [ Laughing ] Kerri , I 'm out of here . Oh , what 's up ? You scared , city boy ? Eggs ain 't gonna hurt ya . No . But whatever laid it might , you dumb hick . Don 't start something you can 't finish . It 'll be your darkest hour . Stop it , Thad . You 're being such a juvenile . Oh , I get it . This turd rolls into town , and suddenly I 'm a big prick ? You want her , Scotty boy , take her . I don 't need no chick telling me what 's what . Besides , she 's gonna head off to college ... and leave me for some study buddy or somethin ' anyways . [ Growling ] Oh , sorry . Are you gonna run and tell its mama ? Or are you gonna call your daddy , the sheriff , so he can arrest me ? Thad , don 't turn around . There 's a giant crocodile behind you . Crocs in this lake ? Real funny . I 'm not kidding . You must think I 'm an idiot . Okay . So there 's a giant crocodile behind me ? I 'm - I 'm real scared . Could you guys go get me a tissue ? I think I 'm gonna cry . [ Roars ] [ Gasps ] Hey , hey ! [ Whimpering ] Hey , hey ! Hang on to me ! [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] Let 's go ! Run ! Kerri , come on ! [ Sobbing ] What happened ? What is that thing ? My guess is whatever laid those eggs . She is not happy . This is Captain Jack Struthers , your eye in the sky . I have no visual confirmation . How about you , sonar ? [ Sonar Pinging ] I don 't have anything either . Just makin ' sure you 're still awake . I can 't do this all by myself . Struthers a pretty good pilot ? No , not really . He 's failed every flight test known to man . He 's crashed three times already . Once was even into an elementary school . Poor kids . Basically , he 's the last person on the earth who should be flying a plane . What ? It was nothing . Wait . I got it . It 's moving fast towards the boat . It 's coming right up behind you . James , turn the boat around . And be careful . Did you hear that , Ahmad ? Be ready . Wait . I lost it . I lost it . Ahmad , I thought I told you to check everything . I did . It was working fine . Yeah , well , obviously you didn 't . What are you waitin ' for ? Do it ! [ Pinging Continues ] Wait . It - It 's slowing down . It 's slowing down . They need air . Let the thing wear itself out . I 'll get it when it comes back up to the surface . [ Emma ] Wait . I lost it . - I lost it . - Must 've ripped itself free . It 's 1,500-pound line . It 's impossible . Line snapped clean . Harpoon must still be in him . [ Pinging Continues ] I think you better get another harpoon ready . [ Struthers On Radio ] There he is . Ahmad , stand down . I paid for this operation .

Losin ' two boats is gonna put quite a crimp in my town 's finances . Well , I 'll pay for your boats . Really ? Yeah . Call it a donation . I can always use the write-off . I 'll have Ahmad cut you a check . Well , thanks . It looks like Ahmad likes to cut things anyway . That head 's gonna look fantastic on me wall . [ Emma ] Don 't you think it should go on Ahmad 's wall ? He was the one who actually killed it . Well , one thing I know is that thing won 't be eatin any of us anymore . That 's the important thing , isn 't it ? Right . I forgot . You came here to save lives . You 're a big hero . I mean , I particularly like the part ... where you pretended to cry when the croc came after you . - That was really brave . - [ Chuckling ] [ Laughing ] Ahmad , you wanna hurry up with them steaks before the fire goes out ? You know what ? You should smoke one of these . Best thing you ever tasted . It smells good . Well , it ought to . $ 500 per box . Of course , you know what would go really well with a good cigar ? Just a wee bit of scotch . Well , if you 're gonna have a wee bit of scotch , I think I could forgo the open container violation . Ahmad , dig out that Johnnie Walker Blue , would you ? Hmm ? Ahmad ? [ Ahmad ] Get it yourself . Beg your pardon ? You have a very poor way of showing gratitude . Gratitude ? Oi . I keep you employed . Employed ? For years , I 've waited on you .

Well , need I remind you ... that if it wasn 't for me , you 'd still be a lion 's dinner . I saved your life , so don 't talk to me about gratitude . Oh , I remember that lion . I remember that lion very well , but not because it took you four shots to hit it at point-blank range , including this one and this one . I remember that lion because you 've reminded me of it every day ... for the past 14 years of my life . Well , this ends today . My debt to you is paid ... in full .

How about you re-pitch your tent in the lake ? Might be drier . [ Laughing ] You think it 's really necessary for you to be enjoying yourself so much ? Maybe now you 'll have some respect for the next man who does your dirty jobs . [ Grunting ] Ah ! [ Struthers ] Well , I hope you 're nice and cozy in there ! Yes . Very comfortable , thank you . Son of a bitch ! Goddamn - [ Snarling ] Can we stop for a break ? I think we should try and get as far away from the lake as possible . Scott , we don 't even know where we are . We 've been wandering around for hours . All right . Let 's try to find a hiding spot , okay ? [ Growling ] [ Scott ] You comfortable ? Besides being soaking wet , freezing cold ... and hungry enough to eat an entire Hometown Buffet ? Yeah . I 'm doing excellent . Yeah , that was ... kind of a stupid question , huh ? No .

How you holdin ' up ? Ah , it 's not goin ' so good . Another one of those darn crocodiles out here just took out Struthers 's man . Listen . Would you please get on the phone and talk to Mike Hobson Jr . ? Tell him we can 't wait around for him anymore . We need that boat A.S.A.P. Will do . Oh , and , Sheriff . What ? Uh , I almost forgot . Scott called earlier today . He said to tell you ... he 's going camping with some friends tonight at the lake . I haven 't heard from him since . I thought I told you to close the lake . Nobody 's supposed to be on the lake . Yeah . I wasn 't entirely sure what - what you meant by that . When I get back to the office , I 'm gonna throw a dart at you . Over . Over . Damn it ! What 's up ? My son is out there somewhere on the lake with his friends . I gotta go find him . Well , might as well bring some firepower . Bring your acronym . My what ? B.Y.A. Oh . Probably went to the campground over by Crazy Sadie 's . [ Growling In Distance ] [ Gasps ] Oh .

We 're going to Sadie Bickerman 's house , find out exactly what we 're up against . [ Clanging Continues ] [ Clanging ] [ James ] Sadie ! I need to talk to you . You 're a little late , Sheriff . Did you get that warrant ? Or did you just come by to take a peek at an old lady in a nightie ? Look . I don 't have time for your games . I 've got some questions . I need some straight answers . Well , unless you 're arresting me , all I got for you is nothing . Have it your way , Sadie . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . I already told ya . I don 't know anything about this crocodile business . Sadie ! I already told you . I have some questions , and I need some damn answers from you . I 'd ask you all in for a nightcap , but I think you 'd all look better in a dunce cap . Listen , Sadie . For crying out loud - This is serious . People 's lives are at stake . Too bad you can 't talk to my sister . I heard she had quite a history with crocodiles . Sadie , my son is out there right now somewhere with his friends . My son , Sadie . Please . Maybe I know a little something . That 's great . Anything you can tell us will help . Somebody tell Trixie to shut her cake hole before I change my mind . [ Sighs ] Emma . There are three of ' em . [ Exhales ] Okay ? Three of ' em . There 's Max . I named him after my late husband , 'cause he was always hungry like Max was . [ Sighs ] Then there 's , um , George Jr . , named after the president 'cause he was slow too . And the last one was big girl , Martha . Martha Stewart . Pretty tough bird in her own right . How do you know she 's female ? She got a mean streak I ain 't ever seen in no man . Also - [ Whispers ] I caught George Jr ... . trying to stick it to her one night on the shore . I wonder which one of these darlings Ahmad took out . Struthers . Pardon me ? I just said , um , they 're adorable names . Cram it , fancy-pants . You think I 'm some dumb cluck ? I know what you 're trying to do to them . Sadie , Sadie , Sadie , Sadie .

Don 't tell me you 're one of those vegetarians . No . That meat is pumped so full of growth hormones , I 'm surprised those crocs are still alive . Well , I can 't afford three tons of Kobe beef a month . My Social Security checks ain 't what they used to be . This is all you 've been feeding ' em , Sadie ? Beef rejected by the F.D.A. ? [ Sadie ] Pretty much . I 've noticed they 've been a lot hungrier lately . Yesterday Martha ate a big rat off my dock . We gotta go out and find those kids . Sadie , listen . Uh , I want to thank you for giving me this information . I know it - it couldn 't have been easy for you . I 'm - When I do what it is I have to do , I promise I 'll be as humane as possible . Good luck . My babies sure as hell won 't be so humane with you . [ Birds Chirping ] Larry . Come on , dude . Wake up . Larry ! Wake up , dude . It 's your turn to be lookout . Yeah . Okay . Fine . [ Yawns ] Keep your eyes peeled for that thing . Wake us up if it goes back into the lake . I know . I 'm not stupid . If you say so . [ James ] Oh , no . Scott ! Scott ! Wait a minute . That 's not Scott . I recognize that sneaker . That 's Thaddeus , old man Sanders 's boy . Poor kid . Oh , my God . What is this thing ? It 's a nest . Which means mama croc is nearby , and she 's territorial , and she 's hungry , and she 's ticked . Sounds like the ex-wife . That 's not funny . We need to get these eggs out of here as soon as possible before they hatch . Let 's split up . Struthers , stay here with Emma . Help her get the eggs out . Get ' em out ? I think we should blow ' em up . Not a chance . We need to get these eggs out of here and back to the lab as soon as possible . Well , whatever the hell it is you do , do it in a hurry . Okay . We 'll meet you back at the campsite . You go find Scott . All right . Give me the grenade launcher . Give me the grenade launcher ! You two be careful . You hear me ? Yeah . [ James ] Scott ? [ Birds Chirping ] [ Snoring ] Larry , you okay ? [ Laughing ] Don 't worry , guys . I 'm fine . Yo , this ground is really soft . [ Whispers ] Larry , don 't move . That 's not the ground .

[ Screaming Continues ] No ! Scott ? [ Screaming Continues ] Anybody ? Can you hear me ? [ Growling Softly ] Now 's our chance . If we hop down and run , we can make it to the road before it gets back . - Then we 're home free . - I 'm not going down there . No way . We can 't stay up here forever . Who knows when help 's gonna get here ? It 's now or never . You think we can make it ? Yeah . Okay . You first . All right . Keep an eye out . Okay . Come on . - Wait . It 's still here . - [ Gasps ] [ Roars ] [ Growling ] Run into the woods , on three . What if it catches us ? It won 't . [ Gasps ] I 'm scared , Scott . Don 't be . Ready ? One , two , three ! - [ Barking ] - [ Growls ] Daisy ! Don 't ! Wait . She 'll be okay . We gotta run now ! [ Snarls ] What about Daisy ? We 'll come back for her . [ Barking ] [ Groans ] Scott ! [ Growling ] [ James ] Scott ! Get down . You two okay ? [ Both Panting ] - Yeah . Yeah . We 're fine , but-but Thad and - - Yeah . I know . I saw him . Thought for a second he was you . Is there anybody else out here with ya ? - Long story . - Tell me on the way out of here . We gotta - We gotta leave . There 's still another one of those damn things around here somewhere . Come on . [ Birds Chirping ] [ Groans ] This nest would explain their sudden aggression . Protecting the young is serious business . Well , that 's - that 's truly fascinating ' . But right now I 'm more concerned with the serious business of protecting me own arse . So let 's finish this up , huh ? [ Sighs ] Here . Let me give you a hand with that . [ Groans ] Oh . You all right ? Me knee . It 's an old injury . Hunting ? Uh , tango lessons , actually . Sadie . Open up . Hi . You must be Sheriff Jr . Guess you didn 't get eaten . You know your dad 's a dumb doofus , don 't ya ? [ Chuckles ] Yeah . He 's a nice boy , Sheriff . Thank - Thanks . Focus . Listen . I need these two to stay here until backup arrives . And I need to go get something out of your freezer . Thank you . Pretty soon I 'm gonna have to start charging you rent . Send the bill to the state . Come on in . [ Sighs ] Just make sure you wipe your feet before - Oh ! Lord . [ Sighing ] Oh . Oh , Lord . Look out . Raised in a barn ? [ Coughing ] God . Come on in . Wait . Dad . Please , let me help you . I don 't have time to explain this to you again right now , Son . What if you don 't make it back ? Then what ? If anything were to happen to you out there , I 'd never be able to forgive myself . It 'd be a hell of a lot worse than me not making it back . [ Chuckles ] Look . You - You saved Kerri 's life . I 'm real proud of ya . You gotta stay here . You gotta take care of her . She needs you right now a whole lot more than I do . Besides , I think she kind of likes ya . [ Chuckles ] She does like me , doesn 't she ? Somebody 's gettin ' older . Somebody 's gettin ' smarter . [ Chuckles ] I 'll see ya , Son . Dad . Yes . Good luck . Good luck to you too . Are you sure this is a good idea ? I mean , I think we was pretty well situated back at the campsite . Well , can you see the nest ? [ Exhales ] No . But I can see the sheriff . Riley ! Over here . I got this out of Sadie 's freezer to use as bait . Kids 'll be safe there . [ Exhales ] What the hell you doin ' here ? I thought I told you to wait back at the camp . Well , Struthers was gonna get up high enough to see the nest , but - Come on , Struthers . Stop loafing . Get up there . Come on . I got a plan . Happy climbing , Struthers . He 's got a plan . Well , I 'm sure it 's better than yours . [ James ] A good Scout always has a plan " B. " So , do you really think it 's gonna eat one of these things ? It doesn 't actually have to eat one of these things . It just has to get ... close enough so that I can ruin its day when I push this button . [ Chuckles ] Besides , anything 's better than hoping Struthers gets off a good shot , right ? [ Chuckles ] Come on . Thank you . I didn 't know anybody lived out here . Yeah . Just me . But I get visitors from time to time . [ Groans ] Must get lonely . Do you have any kids ? Could say so . Two of them died recently . They were good boys . I loved them a whole lot . Three of my friends died out there . They were eaten by these big ugly monsters . Ugly ? Is that so ? Yeah . You should have seen ' em . Big , nasty creatures . They were vicious . Ah . [ Chuckles ] Pretty young girls . Ηmm ? Nothing , dear . Scott . Will you do an old lady a favor ? Sure . I don 't like it out here . I want to go back inside . She 's right . It 's probably safer inside your house , Mrs. Bickerman . Okay . Don 't be such wusses . I want to show Kerri something . Then we 'll head back in . Look . Look . See ? Those are white perch . Excitable little things , aren 't they ? I don 't really like fish . I want to go back inside now . Okay ? No , no . Don 't go . Just wait a minute . No ! Please ! Let go of me ! Let go of me ! Wait , wait . Let go ! [ Sadie ] Kill my children , will you ? [ Kerri ] Get off me ! Get off ! Get off ! Help ! Let go ! Kerri , look out ! [ Screams ] [ Growling ] [ Growling Stops ] There 's four of ' em . [ Rustling ] [ Gasps ] [ Exhales ] I hate that rabbit . [ Soft Chirping ] The eggs are making a weird noise . No , no . I read about that . Uh , they chirp ... when they want to let the mother know they 're about to hatch . Emma . The mama crocodile 's right over there . She 's not gonna go to the nest . She 's gonna go right to the eggs . Get out of there . [ Growls ] Struthers , take a shot . I can 't see . Take a shot ! I can 't see ! [ Growls ] James . If I shoot with this , I 'm gonna blow the whole place up . Take a damn shot . You are useless . [ Growling ] [ Panting ] [ Struthers ] The son of a bitch never had a chance ! I guess you got a head for your wall now , huh , Emma ? [ Panting ] [ Groans ] [ Laughing ] Well , look at that . Emma and the sheriff K-I-S-S-I-N-G . How about me ? I 'm swinging up here in a tree ! Nice . Oh , well , isn 't that beautiful ? What a picture they make . [ Growls ] [ Whimpers ] Wait here . [ Growling ] Say good night , Gracie . [ Roars ] Damn it , Scott . I thought I told you to stay back - Bickerman lied about her crocs . There 's four of ' em . Four of ' em ? [ Snarls ] Anything happens to me , you make sure Emma gets out of here alive . [ Growling ] Emma , get back . I 'm gonna blow this thing right into the middle of next week . [ Growling ] After a while , crocodile . [ Groans ] Dad , here . [ James ] Hey . We 're here . Thank God . [ Sniffs ] [ Sighs ] Scott . Come here . Look . I 'm gonna take , uh , Emma and these eggs to the lab . I 'll probably be home pretty late . Okay . I 'm trusting you here . Okay , okay . [ Chuckles ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Inhales , Exhales Deeply ] I hope all this didn 't scare you out of town . Me ? Nah . I 'm still here for the summer . Not sure how much time I 'm gonna be spending down by the lake though . [ Chuckles ] Tell me about it . Boston College is looking a lot more inviting now . Not too many crocodiles on those streets . Mostly just drunks . But don 't worry . They don 't bite . [ Chuckles ] [ Barking ] Daisy ! Good girl . Good girl . Wow . Dog sure knows how to milk it . Apparently I should have faked my own death . Scott . Kidding . Kidding . [ Chirping ] So , how are our passengers doing ? Oh , they seem to be fine . Just watch the bumps . I 'll watch the bumps . How much further is this place ? About two hours . We can stop in Bangor for dinner , if you want . Really ? So finally giving me a second chance at another date , huh ? On one condition . What 's that ? No talking about ex-wives or crocodiles . Deal ? Deal . [ Chuckles ] English - US - PSDΗ

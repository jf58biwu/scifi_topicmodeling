 Priviously on Surface ... Sure your parents won 't notice ? Whoa . I think he likes them alive . Looks like you caught your fish . Shut this down now ! The damage to his face was extensive . I was about to pronounce him when the nurse found an extremely faint pulse . Mr. Singh . The institute 's research programs have been suspended indefinitely . I was the one that saw it , alone at 5,000 feet . A new vertebrate . George did not drown . Hon , I don 't think you were in your right mind . That thing took my brother . I ain 't leaving till I get a look at it . Mom , what kind of snakes are they ? They 're not snakes , baby . They 're hagfish . These hagfish fed on the carcass . Doctor , you can 't be here . I have a right to my own work and a right to my own research and a right to know what 's down there . This is gonna help me . I met someone else who saw it . - It ? - Yeah . - The sea monster , godzilla thing . - Yes . Come on now . This is a good thing . It means I 'm not crazy . Let 's see . Over there- - somewhere over there is Austin . That 's where I go to school . And down there on the boat , that is Mallory and Garth . Whoo ! Great job , kadee ! - Look at her ! Good job . - You 're next . You know , I cannot believe you guys talked me into this . I can 't believe she did it . I 'd wet my pants . And let 's see . Over there is , um ... what is that ? What- - Mallory , turn around ! Turn around ! Look out ! Oh , my god ! Go that way ! - Look at her . - She is scared to death . Guys , watch out ! Watch out ! Oh , my god ! Look out ! Oh , my god ! Is that age-appropriate behavior ? All that time in a playhouse . They 're making a fort . Boys make forts . You ready , Nim ? What do you think of your new home ? He digs it . You realize this is a misappropriation of university funds . Oh , I would 've gone some place else . But I don 't know that many people who can bar code DNA . - Well , there 's that . - Yeah . - So where 'd you get the sample ? - Intestines of a hagfish . A hagfish is a primitive vertebrate . - It feeds on carrion . - Really . - So what is it ? - Well , it 's 90 % junk DNA . 10 % liopleurodon . - What 's that ? - Kind of a prehistoric eel . Is that a species that exists near the rift ? Well , it did . Liopleurodon is extinct . Has been for a 100 million years . - Honey , honey . - What ? I found the perfect thing for us to do as a family . - Oh , that would be good . - Hey , hey , girls . - Who wants to go on an adventure ? - We do ! We do ! What kind of adventure ? It 's gonna be the type of adventure where we learn all about new animals that are just now being discovered . What kind of animals , daddy ? Like the ones you saw in the ocean ? Southeastern cryptozoology conference . Yeah , yeah . In Houston . Today , today . Isn 't that cool ? - Cryptozoology ? - Yeah , yeah . It 's the , uh , it 's the study of undocumented animals . Oh , and guess what , girls ? They 're gonna teach us how to make a plaster casting track ! - You know , it 's the thing you put ... - Plaster casting track . I can 't believe we 're having this conversation , actually . Baby . Okay , come on . The very least , it 's a family outing , right ? Yeah . Come on , girls ! We gotta go , go , go ! This is gonna be awesome ! Awesome ! Great . Nim . Got you some goldfish , Nim . You know it 's dinner time , don 't you , Nim ? There you go . I hate it when he does that . That is so sick . Get one of these . Uh , you can see it 's amphibianin in nature ... Hey , let 's go over here ! Girls , stay where I can see you . I myself saw a marine humanoid off the keys swim parallel to our boat for over 90 minutes . She 's the most rational woman you 've ever met . And till this day , she 's got a weekend that she just can 't account for . 211 men of the USS Topeka are still unaccounted for , despite the government cover-up that they lost the sub . Did you take that ? May 17 , 2002 . 20 miles off mobile . Made a sound I would not want to hear twice in my life . I can see by your interest that , uh , you 've had an encounter . - Well , as a matter of fact- - - Late May , maybe June ? Late May . How long were you in contact ? One , maybe two minutes . See the lights ? - Dozens . - That 's a first . Do you mind if I make a record of your experience ? Um , I absolutely mind . Any side effects since the encounter ? Yeah . I mean , I 've been having some , uh , episodes . - You know , like panic attacks . - Of course you have . It 's the only sane response to the insane . - Mom . - What is it , honey ? There are dinosaurs in the bible . You know , I 've had similar panic attacks . I have some recurring nightmares . - Rich . - Baby , hang on a second . I 'm talking about something real important here . We are leaving . - Honey , we just got here . - Now . So how long were you a prisoner ? What ? A prisoner in the aquatic city . You 're in perfect health . Recovery 's total , best we can tell . - When can I see my kids ? - Lee 's okay 'd a phone call in time . But I want to keep you under observation for a few more weeks . Never thought I 'd be the one under the microscope . Excuse me for interrupting . There 's been a new sighting in Texas . - The Gulf ? - No. 300 miles inland . 14 confirmed casualties . AP 's reporting that the lake collapsed into a sink hole . - So far it 's not getting attraction . - For now . Relax . Containment 's my specialty . Have we sent anyone below ? The heat is too intense to send someone down . But we are working on an R.O.V. This extends the range estimate . Yeah , to land . This messenage is for Alexander Cirko . I am in the possession of some very compelling evidence that I feel certain he will be interested in discussing . Please call mebefore 5 : 00 P.M. Or my next call will be the Berrong Institute . See if that gets a reaction . What 's a " final notice " ? Oh . - Hello . - It 's Alexander Cirko . Meet me at the Sausalito water front tomorrow at 9 : 00 . That the reaction ? Yeah . One-handing it again , kiddo ? Huh ? What are you doing ? Eels ? So , biology paper ? Well , they have these special cells that all polarize at the same time . And , well , the eel becomes like a battery . - It 's just- - - Sounds pretty interesting . Do you know of any other , um , animals besides the electric eel that shock ? Other than your mother ? No . I love you , son . I love you too . Well , off drugs , out of prison , that 's all I ask . Anybody pregnant ? Just kidding . - What about fireflies ? - Fireflies ? Other electric animals . They glow , right ? Good night . Fireflies ? Well , hon , I learned a lot more about cryptozoology than I ever thought I was gonna . Amen . Yeah , it could 've been a lot worse though , you know . How is that ? Well , I could 've been a prisoner in the aquatic city . Man , those people were crazy , weren 't they ? You know what I was thinking ? Maybe we should take the girls to the Gulf this weekend . Be good for them to get out and have some fun . I don 't know if I 'm ready to go back in the water just yet , baby . Do you think we should go see someone ? No . That won 't help . Don 't be so hard-headed . I am hard-headed . Then help me understand . I don 't understand . That 's the problem . Okay . Come on , Cirko . You tell me 9 : 00 . I get a sitter for 9 : 00 . I 'm here at 9 : 00 . I was surprised to hear from you . Yeah , well , I guess I took a chance and assumed that under neat hall the hardware , you might still be dedicated to open science . Where would you get an idea like that ? I have a dog-eared copy of sudden evolution on my book shelf . Here 's a sample of the extinct genetic material . And yet here it is . Suggests to me that this animal is anything but what , extinct . The sea contains many mysteries , doctor . - An underwater volcano . - A big one , I think . Enough to annihilate all marine life for 100 miles . This is where you first encountered it . - The exact latitude . - Well , that can 't be a coincidence . I 'm sure it isn 't . I wanted you to see this . To see that there are consequences here beyond any you may have imagined . Consequences that make the normal method of collaborations impossible . - Is that a threat ? - I wish it weren 't . Hey , Frodo . What are you gonna do about my jewelry box you broke ? Nothing . I don 't think Sylvia 's gonna be down with your little goblin Gulag . If you tell mom about Nim , it 'll be war . Don 't threaten me . The party . Greg . Valentine 's ? Yeah . It 's all on the table . Why do you care about that disgusting thing so much ? And why do you care about your pom-pom squad ? Because it 's meaningful . Because it represents accomplishment . Yeah ? So will Nim . Yeah . I 'd like to see that on an application to duke . Extracurriculars ? Raised big lizard . You 're a lock , buddy . Not everyone cares about going to duke . Yeah , and what do you care about , Miles ? Komodo dragons , wizards , creatures from another planet ? - What do you have against Komodo dragons ? - You are hopeless . Why don 't you just file for unemployment now and get a jump on it . - You know what your problem is ? - Please enlighten me . - You don 't have a sense of wonder . - You get that off a greeting card ? Well , at least I-I still have some kid in me . Yeah , I can see that . You 're heading towards a playhouse ! Please , Hector , listen to me . A new vertebrate has emerged and Cirko and his people are denying access . - Alex Cirko ? - Yeah , Alex Cirko . Nobody 's heard from him in 15 years . Well , now he 's back and he 's confiscated my research . - So you had an encounter with the species ? - Yes . And it almost destroyed a 50-ton submersible . - And where 's the submersible ? - I told you . The mystic is confiscated . They probably took it down to the San Juan- - They confiscated it ? Wait . Hang on a sec- - look . Here 's a sample . Look . Go ahead , look at it . You prove me wrong . Uh , you know , I want to help you . I really do . But it 's just gonna be tough in light of this whole plagiarism thing . - You don 't know ? - Know what ? I got a phone call this morning from Bessemet in Hawaii . And according to him , three paragraphs of your thesis were lifted verbatim . That 's absurd . He made it sound pretty air-tight . Your degree 's under review . Plagiarism , until it 's resolved , there 's not much I can do . This is all part of it . Part of what ? Part of what ? Hon. You 're gonna be late on your first day back . - Hmm ? Oh , gosh . - Go , go . So I don 't like to fraternize with plagiarists , so I have to ask . Yeah , I did it . I lifted it all . Hey , I understand . I wrote my thesis on caffeine pills and white wine . - I get the temptation . - Come on , this is serious . - They framed me , Carolyn . - Okay , I know . Relax . This is past due , you know . Yeah , well , that 's what happens when you get a divorce and lose your job . So get a new one . Who-who-who 's gonna hire me ? It doesn 't even matter that I 'm innocent . Right now , I 'm unemployable . - I have rent to pay- - - Okay , okay . Let 's just assume that everything you 've told me is true . That there 's an extinct sea monster in the ocean . The government doesn 't want people to know about it . And they 're gonna do what they have to to keep a lid on it . And they don 't fight fair . So why should you ? Sometime- - if she doesn 't want to do something , she won 't- - she won 't do it . She 's generally not aggressive towards people , but if they have a dog ... she 's a powerful breed . You have to learn a technique that allows the brain to snap out of it ... Hey there . What are you watching ? Show about training dogs . We don 't have a dog , Miles . I 'm trying to watch here . Doesn 't mean you have to live like that forever . Owners change . Dog is not gonna be able to change on his own . Whoever is around Emily has to represent authority figure . That 's the only way we can correct the problem when she makes a mistake . Good to see you again , Rich . - Rich , I 'm so sorry . Welcome back . - Thank you . I 'm so sorry about your brother . - Sorry , Rich . - Thank you . Mr. Wilson , you still there ? Hi . I 'm sorry to put you on hold ... Dude , he 's gonna spark , knock you out , and eat your face . Not if I don 't challenge him . He thinks we 're his pack . And there 's a pecking order . If he thinks he 's higher than me , then he 'll challenge me with aggressive behavior . Savannah , do you know where Miles had my tools ? I think I saw him out by the playhouse . With tools come responsibility . Miles , how many times have we been through this , huh ? He 's a proud breed . I just have to teach him who 's the master . Yeah . Whoa . Miles . - Hi , Phil . - Hey . There it is . - There what is , dad ? - My toolbox . When we borrow things , we put them back . Sorry , pop . I want to see my tools back in their proper location from now on , okay ? No problem . Yes , ma 'am . Yes , ma 'am . We 'll be more than happy to take care of that for you . Your policy is definitely strong right now . And the deductible is very high , so that 's good . Yes , ma 'am , I can look at it right now . Um , give me just a second , okay ... Hey , Rich . Rich . Rich ! You 're spilling , man . What are you doing up ? Nothing . How did you respond to Daughtery ? She 's been contained . Your specialty . I have some experience with whistle-blowers . Talk would only make her more determined . So you ruin her career . She has a son , you know . Let 's get to the debrief . This footage was shot last night inside the sink hole in Texas . The navy robot was outfitted to withstand heat up to 800 degrees . - How far did it get ? - 43 , 44 miles . All the way to the magma . That 's when the R.O.V. melted . But not before it sent back this . Why don 't they burn up in the heat ? Perhaps it 's home . You mean that this is their habitat ? Maybe the species isn 't a sudden evolutionary mutation . Maybe they 've been down there in the earth the whole time . The secretion 's ability to recuperate is remarkable . In addition to facilitating Dr. Singh 's recovery , we 've documented it , restoring diseased cells at a nuclear level . No matter how we regulated the temperature , we were losing the sample . Yeah . This image has been slowed down so you can see the deterioration . Millions of cells per second . It would 've been gone by dawn . We had no choice but to freeze it . Imagine the possibilities , Davis . A new era of medicine . Maybe the end of disease . You know your problem , doctor ? You 're an optimist . Hi , I 'm looking for Wayne Johnson . - You got him . - Hi , I 'm Dr. Laura Daughtery . - Hi . Affiliation ? Monterey Oceanographic . Look , I was interested in getting a recording from one of your hydrophones a week or so back . Yeah , what for ? I was on a dive the other weekend sponsored by the institute , and we came across an animal that , quite frankly , I couldn 't identify . Well , I got over 500 hydrophones from Reykjavik all the way to the Cape of Good Hope . So without specific coordinates- - 46 , 15 north . 129 , 53 west . - That 's near the San Juande Fuca . - Yes , sir . Yes , it is . - What date ? - September 19-th . September 19-th . Two guys came in here yesterday looking for the exact same thing . You should be dead . Extensive facial contusions , massive blood loss . - And look at you . - I 'm a miracle . There are no miracles in science . Somehow the species produces a collagen-binding membrane glycoprotein . This allows them to survive such a hostile environment . Alex . What are you doing ? Nothing . Nothing . Who the ... who are these guys ? Both of them are civilians . But they had D.O.D. credentials , and a subpoena to confiscate the material . So they seized the sound file ? From the mic you 're talking about , yeah . So-so what 's the range on these mics ? 500 miles , give or take . So could I pull the sound file from the next mic up the chain ? Say , like , that one ? Do you know how loud an animal would have to be in order to be audible under water ... from a hundred miles away ? You haven 't heard the animal I 'm looking for . My head fell off ... It 's like a needle in a haystack . I 'll shoot ! You 're eating my head ! - Did you hear it ? - No . What 's it matter anyways ? A wild recording means mommy could get a grant or a job or ... Pay the power bill ? Today 's gonna be a good day . No hearing voices . Just regular day for us regular folks . Yup . Just a day in the life . Okay . Go make yourself useful . Looks like we 're in for one , huh ? Hi . I heard you were hiring . You have some restaurant experience ? It 's how I paid my way through graduate school . Yes . I see . Doctor Daughtery . You certainly are qualified . It 's $ 4.25 an hour plus tips . When do I start ? Rich . Rich . All right , Miles , it 's your turn to say grace . Heavenly Father , please bless this food to the nourishment of our bodies . Amen . I think it would be nice if you said something meaningful during the blessing . Dear god , thank you for giving me the opportunities that you have . Thank you for my loved one ... ones . I 'm trying not to get frustrated , even though I know most kids would have given up by now . I know that through consistency and repetition , through positive reinforcement and not rewarding bad behavior that you 'll take careof everything . Because deep down I know that there 's something good in everybody and it just has to be given a chance . - Amen . - Amen . Amen . - Thank you , Miles . - Okay , that was creepy . - Savannah . - What ? Hey , I applaud the effort- - Miles . Miles ! Miles . Jeez . Oh , my god , the playhouse ! Everyone get back inside . Just get back inside ! Miles . Miles , come here ! Miles . Miles , we gotta get back inside , buddy . Miles , come on . Let 's get inside before we get struck . Come on . Come on . Miles ! Back inside . Back inside . Come on ! Rich . Honey ? Honey . What happened ? Something ... wonderful . What ? Rich . Honey , look at me . Look at me . My brother , George , he 's still alive . He 's talking to me . Hey . You went for the heat . It 's okay . It 's okay , little buddy . Did you do it ? Did you make the lightning flatten Savannah 's playhouse ? Did you ? 12 hours , 60 bucks . So much for my thesis . Wrong bandwidth . I have you on the wrong bandwidth . Cirko . It 's Laura Daughtery . I need you to listen to this . Okay , hear this . Do you hear that sound ? That is the species . I have it on tape . You shouldn 't be calling . Who is this ? I believe Dr. Cirko gave you some advice about pursuing this , Dr. Daughtery . Is that what you call it ? " Advice " ? Is that what you call framing someone for plagiarism , taking their career away from them ? When are you guys gonna realize that I am in it ? I am not going anywhere . I have proof . I have evidence of a new life form on tape . I have proof . Imagine a perfectly evolved animal , Mr. Lee . One that has ability to heal itself instantaneously . And you 've replicated the results under controlled conditions ? Wasn 't this proof enough ? Nothing . Not a scratch . Such a species might well be invincible . Impervious to physical harm . Quite fascinating . I 'm not sure I share your enthusiasm . Wadham 's report came in . Complete thermogram of the entire San Juan de Fuca plate . Significant thermal hairline deterioration across the northern Pacific . - The ocean 's heating up . - Yes . They dig , they release heat . The question , Mr. Lee , is how much ? Old faithful erupts more frequently than any of the other big geysers , although it 's not the largest or the most regular geyser in the park . The average interval between eruptions is 91 minutes . Each eruption will expel between 3700 and 8400 gallons of boiling water , and reach heights of 106 to 184 feet . Although the interval between eruptions has lengthened due to vandalism and earthquakes ... Old faithful is still as predictable as it was a century ago .

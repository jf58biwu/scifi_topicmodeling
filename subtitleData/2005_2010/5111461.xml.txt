 You 're always sick . You were sick when you were my age . Evening , sir . Evening , Victor . I didn 't realized that you 're still here . I 'm just keeping James company , sir . If that 's all right ... Very kind of you . - Are you better , son ? - Still cold , Father . It 's just a mild fever . You 'll be all right in the morning . - You always say that . - And you always pull through , don 't you ? Now ... take your medicine . Elizabeth ! Elizabeth ! Your father 's drunk again . You should help it home , Victor . It 's not my name he 's calling , sir . - Father ! - Stay where you are , James ! Father ! I told you never to come back here ! James ... There are things you don 't understand . - Don 't ... - I need him them to know ! Please no ! - No ... more ... lies ! James ... UHNOOOO ! James ! He ... he wasn 't your father son . What are you ? - I didn 't mean it ! I didn 't ... - Yes , you did ! He deserved it ! And you gave it to him . We 're brothers , Jimmy . You realize that ? Brothers protect each other . You have to be hard now . Hard that nothing can 't ever touch us . I want to go home . We can 't . We stick together no matter what . and take care of anyone who gets in our way . Can you do that little brother ? They 're coming ... can you run ? ... Ok . Keep on running . Don 't look back . Back-to-back ! Enough ! Enough ! Stand down , soldier ! Stand down ! Victor , NO ! Ready ! Aim ! Wake me when it 's over . Fire ! My name is Major William Stryker . You were sentenced to death for decapitating a senior officer . Is that correct ? Apparently we have some issues with authority ... - just keep a * * * * on it . - Sir . The warden tells me that your sentence was carried out by a firing squad at 1000 hours - How 'd that go ? - It tickled . You boys tired of running ? Tired of denying your ... true nature ? - What do you care ? - Oh I care ... I care cause I know how special you are . How valuable . Look . You can stay here , locked up like freaks of nature . Or you can join me . I 'm putting together a special team with special privileges . Now tell me : how would you like to really serve your country ? I know all of this weapon more than any other thing in the whole wide world in my whole life . How ? It 's memorable . Sure , it 's a little bulky , tough to get on a plane You would bat a couple of swords at your ex-girlfriends wedding , They will never , ever forget it . That 's funny , Wade . I didn 't think you like girls . Right it is . It 's probably not as intimidating as having a gun or bone claws , or the ... fingernails of a back lady ... - Manicure ? - Victor . Easy . Speaking of sharp , Fred got a new tattoo . - I 'm concerned . - Oh Geez , Fred you just met her last night . - I love her . - You love her after one night ? She 's a gymnast . Bradley , take us ( her ? it ? ) down . Are you gonna puke ? If we were meant to fly , we 'd grow wings . Oh , don 't worry man . Seen more people die driving than flying . How about from empaling ? Hey , be nice . Or be approximation of nice . Would you like a bucket ? - No . - Gentlemen , wheels down in Lagos in five . - Why are we here ? - All in good time . Zero ... - Victor , high ground lookup . - Having fun yet ? - Fred . - Tank ? - Tank . - Yeah , I like that . Great ! Stuck in the elevator with five guys on a high protein diet . Oh Wade , dreams really do come true . You just shut it ! You 're up next . Thank you , sir . Look very nice today . It 's the green . Brings out the seriousness in your eyes . - Oh my God , you ever shut up pal ? - No . Not when I 'm awake . Bradley ? Top floor , please . Cover the elevator ! The Elevator ! Time to go to work . Okay ! People are dead ! If you didn 't have that mouth on you Wade , you 'd be the perfect soldier . Take the diamonds , they 're yours . I don 't want your diamonds . I want this . That ? That is nothing . A souvenir . Where did you find it ? I want the source . A small village , far inland , three days from here . Tell him that this rock is more valuable to me than his life . Ask him where he found it . He says it came from the sky . He 's telling the truth . - You don 't know their language , Logan . - It 's a meteor fragment . I know what it is . I ask him where he found it . Sir , base wants to know our location . Shut him down . Tell him everyone here will die unless he tells me where he found the rock . - He says that it 's sacred . - Okay , fine . Victor . Victor ! Don 't even think about it . We didn 't sign on for this . Put him down . What are you doing ? We finally got a good thing going here . Don 't you screw this up . Enough . It 's enough . We 've done enough . Who do you think you are ? This is what we do . Maybe you 'd rather be ... rotting ' in a hole somewhere till they figure out a way to do us , is that it ? Uh ? I 'm done . You coming ? Jimmy ! We can 't just let you walk away ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Why are you up so early ? Come here . See you baby . Hey . Oh that 's nice ! Yeah ! No . Come on . Hey , what do you do ? You turn off the light , you win a prize . - Two tries for a buck . - Come on , I wanna do it ! Um , that 's obvious . That 's two . - That 's a stupid trick . - It 's not a trick , man . C 'mon . Bye ! Show 's over ! I said show 's over ! The show is never over for us , Bradley . - Victor . - Aren 't you gonna invite me in ? Yeah . Come on in . You know , I 've never said anything to anyone ... about what happened . I 'm living a totally different life now , but ... No need to bring up the past . You know ... I always thought it would be Wade coming knocking at my door . Well .. Wade 's gone . I 'm not afraid of you , Victor . I 'm not afraid to die . How do you know ? You 've never tried it before . Was it the wars ? - Which one ? - All of ' em . Tell me ... It 's just a scratch . Looks like we 're gonna need new sheets again , baby . Yeah ... Who the hell is this ? It smells like government . My God ! Haven 't aged a day ! Clean living . You remember Agent Zero . Still shooting first and asking questions later ? You still chewing those cheap cigars ? Boys , please . I have a job for you . - I already have a job . - Lumberjack ! - Eighteen grand a year ? - Eighteen five . Plus I haven 't had to kill anyone in a while . - Start to miss it ? - Right about now I am . Zero , back to the car . Attaboy . You know , I 'm not proud about the way things ended between us . Conversation 's over . Playing " Little house in the prairie " with a ... school teacher ? That just isn 't you , Logan . And you would know , uh ? I would . What do you want , Stryker ? Bradley was killed three days ago . Wade , before that . I believe that someone is hunting down our whole team . Anyone else ? As far as I know , Victor is safe . - Whoever it is , he 's had names , addresses . - I can take care of myself . This is not about you , Logan . Country needs you . I am Canadian . I know you , Logan ! I know who you are ! What 's wrong ? Stryker came by today . Don 't worry , I said no . Why is he bothering you after all this years ? Because I 'm the best there is at what I do . And what I do best is killing guys . You 're not an animal , Logan . What you have is a gift . A gift ? You can return a gift . Come on , fellas ! - Stay in the car . - Just gonna ask nicely . Mind letting us go by ? You in some kind of a hurry there , pal ? Are you ? - Just move your truck so we can go by ... - Trying to have a conversation there , right ! You start some , you better be ready to finish it . Hey guys , take it easy ! - Your boyfriend 's got a big mouth . - I know . Big temper too , so please , let us pass . Thank you ! How do you do that ? You know , powers of persuasion is a gift . I see ... Do you uh ... have those powers over me ? You didn 't stay in the car . Did you ? Why is the moon so lonely ? Why ? Cause she used to have a lover . - You tell this to the kids ? - No . His name was Kuekuatsheu and they lived in the spirit world together . Hah , it 's a true story ... And every night , they would wander the skies together . But one of the other spirits was jealous . Trickster , one of the moon from South . So he told Kuekuatsheu that the Moon asked for flowers . He told him to come to our world and pick up some wild roses . But Kuekuatsheu didn 't know that once you leave the spirit world , you can never go back ... And every night , he looks up in the sky and sees the moon and howls her name . But ... He can never touch her again . Wow . Coo-coo-cachoo got screwed . Kuekuatsheu . Means the wolverine . What you doing , Logan ? Kayla ! You 're not from around here , are you ? What gave me away ? - You got an insurance for this place ? - Insurance ? No . Too bad . Well , well , well ... Look what the cat dragged in . Guys , whatever this is , take it outside . Why ? Why ? You don 't call . You don 't write . How else am I suppose to get your attention ? I hate to say , James , but ... frankly , I 'm a little disappointed . Stay down . Tell me some , Jimmy , was she worth it ? When are you gonna figure it out ? We 're not like them . I ... am nothing like you . Sure you are . You just don 't know it yet . - What do we got ? - Bar fight . Multiple knife wounds . What ! ? Is this a joke ? The guy 's fine . Where is he ? I said where is he ? I don 't know--who he is . I can help you . Six years , I 've been here . Noone know me and then you show up ! - And the next day , she 's dead ! - I tried to warn you . - Why don 't you told me it was Victor ? - I didn 't know ! I swear on my son 's life ! I didn 't ... Victor 's appetites were becoming too public . I had to lock him out . He thought I betrayed him . Went AWOL ( absent without leave ) . He said he was coming after all of us . You didn 't come to warn me . You came to save your own ass . So what 's your plan , captain ? You can 't beat him , Logan , you know you can 't . I 'm gonna find him and kill him . I can give you the tools to defeat him . - How we can still save the others . - You mean save yourself , right ? I promise you two things : you 'll suffer more pain than any other human can endure , but you 'll have your revenge . I come with you , I 'm coming for blood . No law . No code of conduct . You point me in the right direction and you get the hell out of my way . When it starts , whatever the reason is you 're doing this , focus on that . Maybe it will help . Trust me , I 've been through worse . No you haven 't . We 're ready . We 're gonna make you indestructible , but first , we 're gonna have to destroy you . Remember what we were looking for in Africa ? I remember . Well I found it . It helped us create a metal coumpound so strong , that you will be able to withstand virtually anything . It 's called Adamantium . I can 't put Victor down myself , Logan . To kill him , you 're gonna have to embrace the other side . Become the animal . Let 's do this . I almost forgot . I want new ones . What do you want them to say ? Wolverine . Generals ! Welcome . General Munson . Today , we 're gonna witness medical history . Today , we 're gonna create Weapon X. X ? Roman numeral , Ten . We are about to begin bonding Adamantium to Weapon X 's skeleton . Let 's begin . - We 're brothers , Jimmy . - Logan ! Body temperature is 190 . And rising . Why is he rushing like that ? Why isn 't he sedated ? Feel pain , just like the rest of us . Anesthesia won 't work on him . That 's why he had to volunteer . 195 . - Will he survive this ? - I don 't know . 200 . Son . Heartbeat , near maximum . - Blood pressure ? - 260 180 . He can make it . He can make it . Victor ! I love you . You 're not an animal , Logan . It means the Wolverine . I guess he can die . Come on , Wolverine . Come back . Heart rate rising . Adamantium reservoir is depleted . No rejection . Procedure completed . We did it ! We take him to the island ? The island ? No . The bonding works . We use his DNA for the XI . Erase his memory . Fry his brain . I think he heard you . Lockdown ! Hunt him down ... Take his head off . Travis ! I think there is some naked man in the barn . Son . What in the hell are you doing ? - It 's cold . - Cold ? - You got no clothes on . - Yeah . - You 're not onto drugs , are you ? - No . - Mm ... You just had a rough night . - Yeah , you could say that . Come on up the house . Some of my son 's old clothes will probably fit you . Here , cover it up with that . I don 't want you to give an old lady a heart attack . You 're right in there ? Yeah , everything 's fine . - Supper 's on the table . - I ... Yeah , be there in a minute . I swear I 'm gonna pay for it . Set it down over there . Come and sit down , son . I can 't thank you both enough ... for everything . It wouldn 't have been decent to leave you out there to freeze . - Decent . - What ? Um ... nothing , I 'm just not really used to that word . - That 's a nice chopper you 've got out there . - You know motorcycle ? Oh Lord , here we go . My favorite is a 48 Panhead . All one new of the line . I think you 're a little young for that , son . You must be exhausted . You get a good night sleep . In the barn . Nothing you can break out there . I love you . - Why is the Moon so lonely ? - Why ? Cause she used to have a lover . He can never touch her again . You sleep okay ? Uh ... yeah . You look like a man fixing to do a bad thing . You know , I have * * * * looking for blood . - What ? - They find it . - We all got a choice , son . - Yeah , mine got taken . Bullshit . This was my son 's jacket . Try it on . - Thank you . - Yeap ... You take the bike for a spin , test the suspension 64 uh ... - Man , you heavy . - Yeah , I put on a little weight recently . Good morning ! Good morning ! Oh . It fits you beautifully . I brought you some ... Gun X is in the barn . He just murdered two civilians . * * * two baits . Let 's see if he can survive that . Fire at will ! Come and get me ! Hold his head up . Damn ! Alpha one , do not lose him ! Alfa two , target is coming to you ! Pull up ! PULL UP ! Zero ! Zero , is Logan dead ? Zero , answer ! Did you get him ? Don 't know , I 'm down . Zero , come in ! You tried to kill me . Logan ? Where is Victor ? Come back to base . I 'll explain everything , we 'll take Victor down together . Wrong answer . After I kill Victor , I 'm coming for you . Logan , listen to me . If you go down this road , you 're not gonna like what you found . You wanted the animal , Colonel ? You got it . Those were good people back there . Innocent people . It 's funny how good innocent people tend to die around here . Zero never stood a chance . The only thing that 'll take him down is an Adamantium bullet This facility is compromised . Prep transport . Colonel , this is turning into a disaster . - Don 't worry , we 'll stop him . - Really ? You 've just spent half a billion dollars making him indestructible . - Sir ? - Yes . The young mutant you 've been looking for ? We found him . General , Logan is the only piece of this puzzle . We need to evacuate this facility . Please , go back to Washington . We 've got work to do . Yo hablo I talk . Tu hablas you talk . El habla ? Somebody translate ? Summers ? Sit up and take off those glasses . I have a headache . Then you can wear them in detention , after school when you add up this conjugaison 100 times . Somebody else ? He talks . Thank you . He talks , el habla . - You sure it was Victor ? - Yeah . Damn ! I 'm sorry , man . What the hell happened to him after I left ? He got worse . He felt like you abandoned him . Yeah , we all did . But Victor , he had to prove he was better than you . Hunting and killing everything he was appointed . Quite a few months later myself , couldn 't take running them up . - Running who up ? - Leave it alone . Running who up , John ? Hey ! Goddamn it , John ! We hunted our own kind , Logan . There 's a special place in hell for the things we did . Mutants ? Why ? Stryker say it would be making a difference , protecting people from the bad ones . How you gonna take Victor down , Logan ? - Remember that stuff in Africa ? - Yeah I remember Africa , what about it ? Damn ! What they do to you ? Don 't ask . Listen , Zero said something about an island . Does that mean anything to you ? Nope . But merely Dukes knows . - Him and Zero were tied . - Fred Dukes ? - Where is he ? - He 's here . - Well , let 's go talk to him . - Hold on . He don 't get until round four . But I gotta warn you , he developed a bit of eating disorder . We all got coping mechanisms . Trying to work him back into shape . Come on , Fred , if you want to get in shape , you gotta move man . I told you that I cannot move him . Fred Dukes ? That 's * * * the creature that ate Fred . If you wanna * * * * , don 't mention his weight . Hey , Fat . Fred . Um . So you remember that girl when she was 85 pounds , uh ? - Oh that 's funny . You 're still so funny , Logan . - You know where Victor is ? No idea . What 's the island , * * * ? Don 't let the door hit you on the way out , Logan . This is lame , even to you . Tell me where Victor is . Come on Bob , for old times ' sake , uh ? Did you just call me ... Blob ? No , but- - Told you not to mention his weight . Why did you call him Blob ? I didn 't call him Blob , I said Bob ! Goddamn it ! I got an idea . - This is your idea of an idea ? - Trying to help you out , Logan . Dukes don 't like you that much , and you know it . The feeling is mutual . Use them gloves , man . Dance with them a little bit . Allow them to hang and ride on you . Figure if you do have a fight , he would tell you a thing he would 've known . Come on Bill , look at him . A big old ass coming out the front of the shirt . Jesus , he 's eaten a corn for chrissake . Is there even a stretch big enough to take this guy out of here ? It ain 't him I 'm worried about getting out of here on a stretch . Wraith , you 're an asshole . Whoop his ass ! One ? Oooh . What 's that supposed to be ? Want to dance me ? Oh , that 's good . Good . Hey ! Guess what ? See you can talk now . We got him right where we wanted . Whose side are you on anyway ? Now , where is Victor ? Little dark for sunglasses , don 't you think ? Please don 't ! Please don 't ! Please ! Victor ! Where 's Victor ? Victor 's with Stryker on the island , they run it together . What ? Victor 'd be with Stryker ? Yeah . You didn 't know that ? All that 's left now is Logan , right ? I trust you can handle that . I did before , didn 't I ? Oh yes . You did that . Our deal . It still applies , right ? Of course . Now pack him and tag him , Captain . What 's the island ? It 's where Stryker takes them after Victor 's caught them . Wait a moment . Takes whom ? Mutants . Rumour is that ( has it ? ) Stryker 's doing experiments on them . Mean you never wondered what happened to them ? I tried not to . They killed her so I 'd let them put Adamantium in me . They killed her for a goddamn experiment . Where is it ? Logan . Stryker kept it real secret . But ... - A prisoner escaped there once . - Who ? His name is Remy LeBeau . He was a street hustler from New Orleans . The guards at the prison called him Gambit because he kept taking all their money at poker . That 's all I know . What 's Stryker up to , Fred ? What 's the end game ? He 's taking their powers , trying to combine them somehow . It 's all I know , Logan . It 's all I know . If I have to come back here I 'm gonna take your head off . Coming with you , Logan . - There 's no redemption where I 'm going . - I ain 't asking . There 's our dude . That 's cool . - I 'm gonna cover the back , case he runs . - I 'm not a-fighting with him . - Yeah you ain 't . - What ? I gotta fight with everybody ? Don 't dogs kill cats ? Just go cover the back , will you ? Are you Remy LeBeau ? Do I owe you money ? No . Then Remy LeBeau I am . Large blind 's a hundred , small blind 's fifty . May I give you a hand ? What can I get for 17 bucks ? 17 dollars ? A cab right home , perhaps . You 're my brother 's new babysitter , John ? I ain 't Bradley , Victor . And creepy black clothes don 't scare me . Really ? Worked on Dukes . That a shame , cause now I kill you . Logan wouldn 't miss the chance . So what brings you to our fair city , sir ? Victor Creed . And who 's that ? The man we 're gonna kill . He works for a man named Stryker , on an island . - Just need to know where it is . - What makes you think I know that ? Because I know who you are , Gambit . You are the guy who 's escaped and you 're the guy 's who 's gonna take me back there . You know , John ... There 's some I wanted to tell you . You 're predictable . I can feel your spine Johnny boy . That 's fun . Never knew you had one . It was a mighty nice take you have around the eyes , sir . They might took me more days to lock on . Hey , LeBeau , you listen to me ... Two years I rotted in that hole , and I never go back . Ooh . Shiny . Tell me something , Jimmy . You even know how to kill me ? I 'm gonna cut your goddamn head off . See if that works . You 're being slow , old man . Son of a bitch . You 're gonna die for what you did to her . Victor ! That 's a nice stick . Shithead , here 's the deal . So you 're gonna take me to this island where I can kill Creed , Stryker and pretty much everyone you hate in this world . You understand ? You really want to kill him ? As long as you stand out of my way , yeah . Colonel . General ? Is this weapon XI ? All of their strengths , none of their weaknesses . You really hate them , don 't you ? No . I don 't hate them . After 20 years of work with them , I was the one to see what they can do . If you win this war before it starts , you will save countless lives in the process . Preventive action is the only action here , General . The days of our country sitting on the sidelines are over . We need to take the fight to the enemy before they take the fight to us . - I admire your passion , I do . - Thank you . But this is how far as it goes . Weapon X was a .. a hickup ! We know about your son , Bill . We know he is a mutant . And we know he killed your wife , you shouldn 't have kept that from us . That ... - That has nothing to do with my work . - Bullshit ! You 're too close to this . I 'm sure you know . You 're right . I won 't lie to you . My son did bring the problem home for me . But I took an oath , to protect the american people of every threat both foreign or domestic . - You don 't like flying , huh ? - I 'm fine . - Just concentrate on what you do . - You 're sure ? You got a bead of sweat on your brow there . - Very funny . Just keep your eyes on the ... - On the what ? The clouds ? It 's like a fucking yo-yo in here . Where did you get this anyway ? Oh this is my baby . I won her to a game . - A jacks set with fives . - Great . Relax . We 're almost there . There it is . The island . Three-mile island . Hiding in plain sight . Noone 's been * * * for hiding inside a nuclear reactor . They think it 's gonna turn them into freaks . Like you ? Right ... All right , you ready ? Cos it 's now or never . Let 's go . I 'm tell him . Hey ! If it makes you feel any better , this 's gonna hurt . Oh yeah . It kinda does actually . Good luck . Likewise . Oh shit ! How are you doing ? Everything all right ? - * * * * ? - A few hours . He will respond to my commands ? Yes , Colonel . Logan . Welcome back to the war . Before I cut you , I wanna know why . I needed your powers for the Pool . The what ? The mutant killer . Deadpool . Years of researching , and finding the right powers that can coexist within one body without ripping it apart . My son was the first piece of the puzzle . Logan , you are the last . You made weapon XI possible . I asked you to help , but since you wanted a quiet life ... Well I 've learned that nothing motivates the man in your family like ... revenge . Who are you ? She 's a real old friend . You really think we just let you walk away . A dangerous man . I like to keep an eye on dangerous men . Tell him about the day you died . They gave a shot of hydrochloride thiazide . It reduces the heart rate so low , it appears even flat line . Don 't be angry with her . It 's a real credit to your species . Did you know that her sister has diamond-hard skin ? Kayla 's mutation is tacto-hypnosis . She can influence people as long as she touches them . Quite a useful tool in a seduction . It was never real my friend . It was real for me . Told you if you came down this road you wouldn 't like what you found . That story you told me , about a man who ditched flowers for the moon ... I had it backwards . I thought you are the moon , and I was Kuekuatsheu . But you were the trickster , aren 't you ? I am just the fool on that play . The worst part of it is : I should have known . I ignored my instincts . I ignored what I really am . Then that will never happen again . - Colonel . - Not now , Kayla . I have done everything you asked . My sister ... You said if I 'd help you , you 'd let her go . Kayla it 's not as simple as that . A mutation 's unique . Quite beautiful . We just need a little more time to analyze it , that 's all . You let him go ? - Victor , please . - You can 't let him go . - You can 't beat him , Victor . - Give me the Adamantium ! - Tests came ... - We had a deal ! You would never survive the operation ! - I can take anything he can . - No you can 't . You 're my favorite soldier , Victor . Be patient , your time will come . He 's using us . How about this time , you die for real ? Let me go . Your * * * don 't work on me . Victor ! Feels good , doesn 't it ? All that rage . Do it . Logan ! You 're not an animal . Oh yes you are . Do it . Finish it . Logan ? My sister . They have my sister . Please . I didn 't trick you into loving me . It was real for me too . Please , I 'm so sorry . They have my sister . Where is she ? - Activate weapon XI . - The bounding process isn 't complete . Just do it ! Now ! You okay ? Come on . Okay . Perfect . - Kayla , get these kids outta here . - Logan ? Find another way out . Come on . Let 's go ! Wade , is that you ? Guess Stryker found he finally figured out a way to shut you up . Wade ... You don 't have to do that . Or maybe you do . Shoot on sight ! I can help . Take me at it . Go ! Go ! Now ! Think I get ' em ? Yeah . - Let 's go . - I can 't go . Kayla , come on ! I have to stay here . You take them . Go ! ( Go left . ) Left . - What ? - We go left . - You can 't see . - Trust me . Climb on up . Let 's see how you dance up here . Nobody kills you but me . Back-to-back ! - I see . - No . Stop ! - This can 't be the way . - This is the way . - How do you know ? - I just know . Come on . Adamantium bullets . Let 's see him heal with a few of these through his thick skull . You cannot stop him . Even with that . He 'll heal . His brain may heal . But his memories won 't grow back . This does not change anything between us , Victor . We 're done . We can never be done , Jimmy . We 're brothers . Brothers look out for each other . - You miss me ? - Oh Jesus ... When you said you were gonna kill everyone , I thought you mean really exaggerating . Here ... Do I look like a man who exaggerates ? You 're welcome . These kids try to get off the island . - Split up . Go ! - I 'm on it . I love you . No ... I am so cold . Listen to me , I 'm gonna get you outta here . You understand ? Slow and easy . Nice and easy . I 'm gonna keep you up . I should make you pull the trigger . But that would make us no better than you . Drop the gun on me . Walk until your feet bleed . And then keep walking . It will be all right , Scott . My name is Charles Xavier . I am a mutant like you . - I can hear your thoughts . - Yes . And I can hear yours . You are safe now . Come . We have to go . The kids are safe . - Who are you ? - What do you mean who am I ? I 'm the guy who brought you here . Now we gotta go . Where the hell am I ? Listen , I am a friend . A friend . What 's my name ? What 's my name ? Your name is Logan . You need to trust me . We have to go . Follow me . Now ! Do you know her ? No . Bet these boys aren 't gonna like what you did in this place . We really need to go . I 'll find my own way . Good luck . Colonel Stryker ? - Colonel William Stryker ? - Yes . You 're wanted for questioning in connection of the death of Gen. Munson . Sir .

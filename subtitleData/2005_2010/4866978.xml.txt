Once you return , deliver it to me , Your sweet charlie will be set free . - i have your film . now i want charlie . - soon . - this is entry number four . When two or more of these forces are proximate , They amplify exponentially Like a kind of gravity or magnetism . An abnormal spike in seismic activity As of late appears to be Emanating from one of the individuals Being held here . A pregnant woman . - doctor ! He 's crowning . - and i fear ... i fear that this child May indeed ... I 'm coming. it 's okay . It 's okay . - butterfly man , open up . You can 't avoid me . I can see you in there .

It feels poetic that today is the day We give thanks . - stop ignoring me , butterfly man . I want charlie . - and you will have her . But there are more pressing matters to discuss . That film that you retrieved , It 's brought everything into focus . I discovered the truth about my destiny . Our destiny . - give me charlie . - sorry. not yet . There 's a nice sharp axe right over there . Go on. freeze time . Chop me into bits . No , that 's right . you can 't . 'cause if you kill me , You 'll never find charlie . - i 'm your savior , hiro . You just don 't know it yet . Now go help set the table . And smile . It 's thanksgiving . - so when should i expect you ? - oh , i don 't know . - well , you 've got to come . - happy thanksgiving . I just don 't know that i 'm in the mood . - come on . you can invite gretchen . - actually , i can 't . She moved all the way across campus . - i 'm sorry to hear that . And that 's my fault , isn 't it ? - it 's okay . It wasn 't gonna work out anyway . So i guess it 's official . I 'm a social pariah . - and i haven 't helped things much . I want to make it up to you , Starting with a real bennet family thanksgiving dinner - Turkey , trimmings , the whole thing . What do you say ? - and since when do you cook ? - well , you know , i 'm learning as i go . Is that a yes ? i don 't know . Is lyle coming ? - no , he sends his regrets . He can 't get away from school . Don 't make me be alone with your mother and doug . - she 's bringing the new boyfriend ? - oh , she never goes anywhere without him . It would mean a lot to me , claire . - okay . There 's something i 've been meaning To talk to you about anyway . - great . i 'll see you at 4 : 30 . Don 't be late . love you . - noah ? Oh , my god . - lauren . Wow . - of all the supermarkets In all the towns in all the world . - it 's great to see you . - you too . - well , what are you doing in washington ? - well , after primatech exploded , I was kind of unemployed . Cia seemed like the obvious choice . - ah . - you ? - um , you know , a little bit of this , a little bit of that . - all right . - mostly that . I got a place in dupont circle . - nice . What brings you to this side of town ? - these yams . these canned yams . I love them , and i can 't get ' em anywhere else . - huh . Hmm , didn 't peg you for a yam man . - oh , yeah , big yam man . - you 're stalking me , aren 't you ? - yes , but i am also cooking thanksgiving dinner For my daughter and my ex-wife . - ex-wife . - yes . sandra left me . Can 't say as i really blame her , But we 're still on good terms . I mean , hence the oversized bird . - are you having thanksgiving on christmas ? Because this frozen beast is not gonna thaw until tomorrow . You need one of those already-cooked birds . - oh ... okay . - follow me . - thanks . i appreciate it . 'cause i 'm not exactly an expert In life skills . - how many people ? - four. five , if you would like to join us . That is , if you don 't already have plans . - and by the way you 're sizing up My single-serve turkey pot pie , You 've already surmised that i don 't have plans . - it would be great to catch up . - happy thanksgiving . - mom , what are you - - mm-mm-mm . Please , set up in there , boys . - what is this ? - where 's your brother , honey ? - that 's a good question . - ah . Would you please put these in a bowl for me ? - we need to talk . - yes , i know . That 's what thanksgiving 's all about . Just families sharing our lives . Thank you , gentlemen . Okay , and please remember to stir some milk into that . That 's the way your brother likes it . - i went to a storage unit yesterday , mom . Rented out to you . Saw nathan 's dead body . - rene told you about that . Well , it was not your brother 's body you saw . It was a shape-shifter posing as your brother . It 's the worst kind of identity theft . And he had to be stopped , And then we had to store him away discreetly . You can imagine if the press had gotten wind . - matt parkman also said that ... - matt parkman said what ? Officer parkman is unbalanced . Suicidal , last i heard . - because sylar 's in his head ? Is that right ? What did you do , ma ? Is my brother really dead ? - answer him , mom . We 'd all like to hear that one . - happy thanksgiving , nathan . So if you two will just help me set the table , We will sit down like a family And we will discuss everything . Ow . Let go of me , nathan . - answer him . - it 's thanksgiving , and you are my family . And we will sit down like a family As we do every year , or i will leave here , And you will never hear from me again . Your choice . - hello . - hey. happy thanksgiving . - mm . - come on in . - something smells good . Look at this place . Are you sure this is your apartment ? - we clean up good . So what can i get you ? some sparkling cider ? - no , i 'm all right , but before everyone gets here , I do want to talk to you about something . - okay , just let me check the gravy first , okay ? - oh , i got that . - claire , you remember lauren ? She worked with me at primatech . - uh , hi . - hi . you 're all grown-up . You look beautiful . It 's okay . i 've got this , wolfgang . - thanks . - does mom know you brought a date ? - no. no , no , no . lauren 's not a date . She 's an old friend . She 's helping me cook . - she is so a date . You should have told mom . - your mother will understand . We 're a complex , modern family . And she 's got doug . So what did you want to talk about ? Hold that thought . - mm . - hi . - mr. muggles . - hey . happy thanksgiving . - you too . - good boy . - hey , noah . happy thanksgiving . A host gift . - oh , thanks , doug . Come on in . - hi . - hi. how are you ? - good . - good . Who 's your little friend ? - dame penelope jean lovegood iii . But you can call her ms. lovegood . Can 't she , snookums ? yes , she can . Yes , she can . - claire , you remember doug . - yeah. hi . - enchante . - dinner 's ready , everyone . - you hired a cook ? - no , that 's lauren . - wow . mistaken for a domestic . That certainly breaks the ice . Lauren gilmore. it 's nice to finally meet you , sandra . Okay . uh , let 's eat . - you brought a date ? - no . That 's lauren . Okay. who 's hungry ? Got lots to eat . come on . - not a fan of thanksgiving ? - i 'm from japan . we celebrate kinro kansha , not thanksgiving . - what 's the matter , hiro ? You can talk to me . we 're family . - i 'm not part of this family . I 'm a prisoner . - no one 's a prisoner here . - samuel broke his promise . I fixed the past , but he won 't give me back charlie . He 's a liar and an evil man . - if the time traveler fixed the past , where 's joseph ? - that 's a good question . You got a minute , hiro ? Come inside . We need to talk . Tell me , what did you do When you fixed the past for samuel ? - oh , i 'm sorry . i cannot say . Samuel might get mad , and charlie 's at stake . - i understand . I have to change for dinner . You stay a minute , will you ? You know , hiro , We can help each other . I could use my ability . - really ? - i can be inside of your soul . We can be as one . - oh , painted lady , I think you are trying to seduce me . But you should know my heart belongs to charlie . - i 'm sorry If i 'm making you uncomfortable . I can help you . But i need contact , Closeness to make this work . - of course . Every ability has a different set of rules . - i can feel what you feel , hiro . Touch me . You want charlie back desperately . - yes . - and now samuel 's forcing you to work for him . Why didn 't he have you save his brother joseph ? - huh ? I don 't know . You should ask samuel . - he 'll never tell me . You need to take me back . Eight weeks ago , when a man from the government Came to the carnival and murdered joseph . - no , i don 't think i should - - please . I need to know the truth . - oh , no , you made us time travel . We must go back . - is that the man that killed joseph ? - no , that 's dr. suresh . - we need to talk . - joseph ? - i 'm behind on my chores . - forget the chores . - this is not good . - all right , brother . But not here . - is this it ? Is this the night that joseph gets murdered ? - i don 't know . But it is very dangerous to be here . We must go before we step on a ... Butterfly . - okay , mom , you got us here , sitting , just like you wanted . So talk . - peter , where are your manners ? Nathan , would you please say grace ? - no . - it 's thanksgiving , nathan . It 's the one day we should express our gratitude . - what do i have to be grateful for ? I 'm dead . he knows it . You know it . Why don 't you tell us why and put us all out of our misery ? - tell us . - i don 't expect you to understand Or approve of the decision i made , But i hope you can keep an open mind And not condemn it . Sylar was gonna kill the president , And you two had flown off to stop him At that hotel in washington . And i had a dream about you , nathan . I saw you fighting for your life . I also saw matt parkman save you . But i panicked , And i went and found him , and i dragged him to the hotel . But by the time we got there ... - i was already dead . - i made matt parkman do it . This is the part where i ask you to forgive me . - so that body that we saw ... That was nathan . - technically , yes . But , as far as the world is concerned , Nathan is still alive . - yeah , but i 'm not me . - it 's your mind . They are your memories . You look exactly the same . You are nathan petrelli . You are my son . you 're peter 's brother . And it 's been this way for months . And just because you know the truth , Nothing has to change . We are still a family . To us . - i would like to propose a toast To all of you for being here On this , my first thanksgiving in this apartment , My first thanksgiving i 've ever hosted . I ... And that 's especially to lauren . Without her , We would all be eating japanese takeout right now . cheers . lauren . - so sandra , how did you and doug meet ? - mm , well ... - may i ? - please . - it was love at first sight . For mr. muggles and ms. lovegood , that is . We met at the groomer . My little angel wouldn 't stop barking Until they put her cage Right next to his , am i right , sandy ? - it 's true . nasty . - uh-uh . dougy 's allergic . - legume-intolerant . - so how did the two of you meet ? - well , lauren and i used to work together At primatech . And we-we recently reconnected . - yeah , this morning , actually . frozen food aisle . I troll the place for eligible men . - primatech . Is that the paper company or that other thing ? - oh , you know about that other thing ? - yes , dear . A memory can be erased only so many times . So you worked closely then ? - well , it wasn 't like that , you know . - or am i stumbling onto something That i 'm not supposed to remember ? - you 're not stumbling onto anything . I think we should all just enjoy our thanksgiving dinner . You know , in my family , on thanksgiving , We used to go around the table And everyone would say what they were thankful for . Okay , i 'll go first . I am thankful for the two beautiful women in my life - Ms. lovegood and my beautiful sandy . - aw . Nice . - okay . Um , i am thankful that my daughter claire Decided to come for thanksgiving . It would not be the same without her . - i 'll second that . - i 'm thankful for canned yams . - how about you , claire ? - um , i know that i should be thankful , But i 'm just not feeling it right now . - is everything okay ? - her roommate moved out . - oh , why on earth would she do that ? You 're so likeable . - doug , you don 't know anything about me . - claire . - what ? You want to talk about it right now ? Fine . I 'm thinking about dropping out of school . - my family ... This will surely be A thanksgiving to remember . Where 's lydia ? - not really sure . - amanda , sweetheart , where 's your mother ? - i think she went to go find the japanese man . - did she now ? Happy thanksgiving . That man from india , he wasn 't writing a book . He wanted to talk about me . You sent me away , but i stayed , I listened , i heard everything . How long have you been lying to me , huh ? - you need to calm down , brother . - then stop controlling me . Stop manipulating my emotions . - fine . you want me to let go . I will . - my whole life , you 've kept me under your thumb . Why ? - because you 're dangerous , samuel . - what 's that supposed to mean ? - oh , never mind . - no , tell me what you meant . - you can move the earth , samuel . But it 's more than that . Cities . Mountains . You have the power to kill millions . I can 't let that happen . - i always thought i was missing out On something , Some untapped potential . Just tell me how . How can i be that powerful ? - no . I 've already said too much . You think i wanted this life ? You had to be controlled . From the day you were born , I gave up everything to watch over you . - let me free you of that burden . Show me the film . Let me learn what i am . Take responsibility for myself . - too late . I told dr. suresh to burn it . - why would you do that ? - you can never know the truth . I 've made arrangements . A man from the government is coming To take you in . I gave him a compass . - you 've betrayed me . My entire life , you 've betrayed me . - i 'm still your brother . I love you . joseph . No , no , no , no . Oh , joseph . Oh , god , what have i done ? What have i done ? He 's coming . - i know that you guys are freaking out , But i don 't think college is where i 'm supposed to be . - is this about gretchen ? Because that is one relationship . - yeah , it is about gretchen . And it 's about becky , And it 's about everything that 's happened . - who 's becky ? - mom , look , i just don 't think That i belong in college . - and where do you think you belong , Or have you even thought about it yet ? - maybe i 'll go for a year abroad . Maybe i 'll go backpack through europe . A job . I just need to find somewhere where i fit in , Where i could be myself . - and the $ 40,000 i just gave to the school , Where do you think that should go ? - i don 't know , dad . where 'd it come from ? - this is about what that guy samuel said , right ? - who is samuel ? what is going on ? - maybe it is . - how could you even consider listening to him ? - what is happening ? what did your father do ? - this is not about dad . It 's about me . i can 't lie anymore . I 'm a freak , and people don 't like freaks . - can i just interject something here ? All : no ! - i think that we should all just take a deep breath . - all i was gonna say is that what claire is feeling Is perfectly normal . I mean , we 've all felt like we didn 't fit in At one point or another in our lives . Heck , growing up and discovering i had a penchant For dog breeding , you think i had any friends ? Uh-uh . Trust me , claire , this will all blow over . - really ? Is it , doug ? Do you think that this is going to blow over ? - what are you doing ? Both : claire ! - aw , jeez . - how 's that for normal ? - great . - get more wine . - i have to tell them . - no . You can 't say anything . If someone finds out i took you to the past , I will never see charlie again . - i have something special . i 'll be right back . - please . - i 'm sorry , hiro . But we have to stand up to him . Some things are just too important . - where you been , friend ? - oh . i got lost . - well , now you 're found . Something going on over here ? - no . - something in your hair . - hmm . - well , then , you must be starved . Hiro , join me . Make yourself useful . Pass the chair , will you ? - guess he 's never seen her regen before . So some dinner , huh ? - par for the course . Especially when it comes to my ex-husband . I don 't know what 's going on between him and claire . - well , i don 't know either , But i think that thanksgiving dinner was just his way Of letting claire know that she has a family That loves her . Nothing wrong with that . - i thought you gave up all this . - yeah , so did i . And then i come across this compass , Which almost gets me killed . It turns out it belongs to the strange man Who shows up in my daughter 's dorm room Threatening the normal life she so desperately wants . - well , maybe it 's impossible . Maybe i 'm just not supposed to have a normal life . - it sounds like you 're giving up . Why did you cut yourself ? - i don 't know . Maybe because you guys all think that you know What it 's like to be me , but you don 't . How could you possibly ? I have to lie to everyone . Otherwise , they faint . - i know that it has been hard , And i know that i have caused you pain , But i 'm concerned about you , claire . These are not good people . They 're dangerous . You just have to trust me on this . - would you stop treating me like i 'm a child ? - then stop acting like one . Let me get this . - sorry i 'm late . - hey , come on in . - who 's ready for pie ? - is there a problem , mom ? Some family . You look at me , you don 't see your son . You see the man who killed your son . - don 't be silly . - you don 't see your brother . Well , that 's because i 'm not your brother . - nathan . - guess again . - oh , god , sylar 's in there with you , isn 't he ? - we never should have gone to texas , pete . - nathan . Nathan ! - nathan . It feels good to finally be me again . What 's for dinner ? I 'm starved . - you know what makes this meal truly special ? It 's knowing that each and every one of you Had a hand in making it happen . Just as we 've had a hand in each other 's lives , In our shared destiny . Uh . Heaven . We have depended on each other for so long . Through good times and bad . But tonight we should be especially thankful . The future is here . And it will be greater than my brother joseph Could ever have imagined . But i can 't tell you about it yet . Not while there 's a traitor in our midst . I just learned that the person who killed my brother Is here , Sitting at this table . It 's time we all knew the truth , Isn 't it ? - tell them , samuel . You murdered joseph . the time traveler saw it . - really ? Is that what you saw , hiro ? - i 'm sorry . i have to think about charlie . I didn 't see anything . - we know what you did . - why so angry , edgar ? Is it because you 've done something shameful ? You killed joseph , didn 't you ? You betrayed us to the government . And when joseph found out , you killed him . - you lying bastard . What have you done ? - i saved your life . look . - thanks . i 'm gonna finish him . - no , you can 't hurt him . He 's the only one who knows where charlie is . - he killed joseph . - i know , but this is not the time for revenge . Sometimes a hero has to run away To live to fight another day . We will defeat him . i promise you . - i 'll hold you to that . - only the guilty turn tail and run . Edgar is gone . good riddance . - mm . I feel like i haven 't eaten in months . Mm . You think that 's some kind of existential soul thing ? - you have a soul ? Come on , buddy . That 's the best you got ? No big speeches about hope ? Triumph of the human spirit ? - why don 't you let me out of this chair and find out ? - and you ... You have raised the evil incarnate bar To an entirely new level . Thank you ... For giving me something to strive for . - all this talk of souls and spirits Sends my head spinning . I am not a religious man . But there is one thing i do believe in . Blood . Time to carve the turkey . - get away from her . - what 's happening ? - it 's nathan . he 's in there . Come on , fight him , nathan . come on , fight him . - nathan 's dead . - no , he isn 't . he 's still in you . His spirit and his mind Are fighting for his family . Nathan ! - come on , nathan ! Nathan ! - nathan . nathan , fight him . What have you done to me ? - nathan ? - thanks . - oh , i 'm so sorry . - it 's okay . - so my dad called you ? - yeah , well , he said you were feeling low , And he knew i was feeling low , so ... - how 's your new roommate ? - fine . Dull . Actually , it 's awful . No one 's tried to kill me for days now . And she 's a slob . - well , you know , The other side of the room is still available . Sorry. you 're right . I don 't know why you would ever want to move in with me again . - maybe because of all the people that i 've met in college So far , you 're the only one who 's ever made any sense to me . - now see , i told you you were gonna have fun . What do you think about christmas ? - how about a movie ? - much better . - should i give you my number , or were you just planning On stalking me in the produce aisle ? - uh , canned goods i think it was . - my home number is on the back . Use it . Happy thanksgiving . - you too . - good night , ladies . nice meeting you . Both : bye . - we 're leaving , claire . - happy thanksgiving . - bye . - sorry about doug . - he 's fine . I told him he ate a peanut . He 's not the sharpest tack , but he 's a good man . never a dull moment , noah . - not if i can help it . - thank you . - bye . - bye-bye . - i 'm gonna go wait in the car . Thanks for the invite , mr. bennet . - anytime . I guess " i 'm sorry " doesn 't begin to cover it ? - no , it 's not your fault . i 'm just i know , i know . you 've got a lot to figure out . I just want you to take your time and really think About your choices , claire , because you do have choices . - you 're absolutely right . - so you 're going back to school ? - yeah , classes start monday , And i will be there . - that 's great news . Mm. love you . - love you . And thank you for inviting gretchen . - i wasn 't overreaching ? - no , it was actually the perfect dad thing to do . - next thanksgiving , your place . - it 's a date . - hey . ready to head back ? - actually , no . We have a couple days off Before classes start , And i want to find out where this leads . - where 'd you get that ? - i stole it from my dad . He said i had choices . And i want to know what they are . And this is going to lead me to ' em . - a compass ? Okay . - you up for an adventure ? It 's okay if you 're not . I understand . i mean ... We might run into becky there . - oh , yeah , she 's not one of my favorite people . But you are . So which way ? - take a right . - you saved edgar . How honorable . Of course , when you betray me , You put charlie in danger . - your brother was right . You are powerful . But i am powerful too . - i 'll make it so you never see her again . - you won 't do that . You still need me . So you tell me exactly when And where charlie is , or i am leaving . And you will be the one who is lost . - i like this . Little man standing up for himself . But you don 't actually think i 'd ever let you leave , do you ? - you don 't have a choice . - i always have a choice . How do you feel , hiro ? - what have you done ? - i 'm gonna find him , And i 'm gonna bring him back , mom . - it 's over . It isn 't possible anymore . - the one thing i know , the one thing i can count on Since all this started , is that anything is possible . - it 's sylar . - nobody wants him dead more than me . You want to know what i want even more ? My brother alive . I 'll find a way .

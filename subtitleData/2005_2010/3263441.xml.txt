 Let me tell you about my day so far . Coffee in Paris . Surfed in the Maldives . Took a nap on Mount Kilimanjaro . Oh yeah , and I got digits from this posh chic in Rio . And then I jumped back for the final quarter of the NBA finals . Of course , I 've course . And all that was before lunch . I could go on , but what I am saying is , I am staying on top of the world . It wasn 't always like this . Once I was a normal person , a chump just like you . - - Hi Millie . - Hi David . You 've got a lot of cities there . Well , when I have a dream , Might as well dream big , right ? Right . See you later . Millie ! Give me a second . Hey ! I just want to give you this . Pick it up from a yard sale . I thought you 'll probably like it . It 's a little ding-dab . Missing a few steps . I love it . Do you ? - I do . Holy crap , Rice Bowl . Mark . What this ? Christmas come around early ? Mark , give it back to her . Look what David got for Millie . You guys like the Eiffel Tower ? If you shake hard enough , you can actually hear the tower move . Hey ! Who wants to give a shake ? That 's enough ! Stop it ! Just give it back . Alright . Ok . I 'm sorry , here . Sorry buddy . Guess like I don 't know my own strength . Do you think this is a joke ? I was only playing . It wasn 't funny . David ? David , don 't go out there . It 's not safe . David , just forget about it . Come on Rice Bowl . Don 't be stupid . David , come back , come on . Just let it go . It 's ok . Stop , it is not worth it . Just come back , please . Come on David ! - - Be careful , come on . - All good , see . Great . Come back ! - - David ! - Millie , don 't go out there . David ! Someone help me . - - David ! Get help ! Help please ! You can 't help him . - David ! Millie stop , stop ! And that 's how it happened the first time . One second I am a goner , and the next thing I know I ended up in the public library . Home , sweet home . Mum left when I was 5 . As for my dad , well let 's just say he wasn 't emotional . You 're late ! Supper is cold . Where have you been anyway ? You know when I ask a question , I expect an answer , okay ? Hey , hei , hei ! What happened to you ? Those kids at school . - Hey David ! Come back down here , get a mop and clean it up . David ! David . Make the right choice ! David ! David ! Open the door . I just teleported . Great . I teleported to the library . That 's when it occurred to me . This thing that just happened . It could set me free . And if she could run away , so could I. Alright . I wanted to tell her everything . David ? I mean , who would believe me any way . I figured it is time for me to move on . I would like a room . You 're not going to be any trouble , are you ? No weird stuff ? No , no weird stuff . JUMPER So there I was . Had a million questions . Like , how does this thing work ? How do I control it ? Been there . - Mummy , mummy ! You can see the ocean and everything . If we 're lucky maybe we 'll see King Kong . Really ? You got me . I got you . I 'm not letting you go . EMIGRANT SAVINGS BANK I was fifteen .

I am going to need a bigger bag . Oh shit ! Wow ! Hey ! I said no weird stuff . Let 's go . Two days late . You owe me rent . Hello ? The police and the FBI have already been through here . Whom are you with ? NSA ( National Security Agency ) They couldn 't make heads or tails of it . The vault has a time lock , pressure mounts , steel plates .. This guy didn 't even ... Open the door We didn 't even know we were robbed till half way through the day . I want the security tapes for the whole month . I need the name of everyone who has a safe-deposit box in the vault . That 's confidential . Why do you need those names ? Whoever robbed your vault has been in here before . I want those names , and the tapes , today . The story had a happy ending . Rice bowl is dead . But , I 've never been more alive . Now I 'm living in New York . Why settle in a one place , when you can have the whole world . Closer to the river . But as you can see this flood became more severe 10 minutes ago . The question now : What will happen to these people ? It will take a miracle to get to them . Good afternoon , Mr. Johnson . How are they doing ? Down by six and a half . Don 't think you 'll be needing that umbrella . You never know . Mind if I join you ? - No . What are you drinking ? - Gin and tonic .

This conversation is not over . You answer my questions ! Tell me ... How did you last this long ? Who is helping you ? Jumpers . It 's kind of hard to jump with a thousand volts of electricity passing through your brain , right ? Who is protecting you ? Give me an answer so I can go home . I hate Jumpers . Think you can go on like this forever ? Living like this , without consequences ? There are always consequences ! Where are you going ? I got you now . You think you can hide behind the wall . Go anywhere . Do anything . Not anymore ! David ? Is that you ? David ! Don 't go . Just hear to me out , okay ? David . I don 't know if I am going crazy or not .

No . - - Fiona , I going to have a break now ? - Ok , sure . So , you 're back . Now what 's your plan ? Maybe going to do some travelling . I was thinking of checking out Rome actually . You were thinking of checking out Rome ? Come on . You know that was my dream . Don 't try to run me off , okay ? So come with me . Come with you ? You are asking me to go to Rome ? I mean only if you want to skip the boring parts . Welcome , miss . I got it . I 'll take it . Thank you . It 's your luggage . Can you believe this , that 10 hours ago we were in Ann Arbor ? Yes - - What does the CIA want with this ? - I am afraid that 's classified . Really ? Well then I am afraid I am going to have to see a federal warrant . Because I don 't believe you are who you say you are . Certainly . Great , another cop . So Mark , tell me what happened at the bank . I told them already . You are just another suit . You are never going to believe me . It says here that you were being jumped into the vault . Want to laugh about it , go ahead , have a laugh . You hear me laughing ? The girl 's name is Millie Harrison , She boarded a plane to Rome 16 hours ago . But she didn 't go alone . Thanks . So what do you think ? I think , there is something you are not telling me . What do you mean ? This room . First class . Usually in my life , when things seem too good to be true , they usually are . I told you , I am in banking . You see , I know that you flunk algebra . David , if you don 't want to tell me everything , that 's fine . Just don 't lie to me . I am not lying to you . Good . Can 't reach that . Take it easy . You know , you could have asked me out on a date . You know that this has always been the number one from my list . I know . You must be good at all this . Good at what ? Rookie , you have no idea . Wait , wait , wait ... Sorry sir , Sorry , no , no ... No . Impossible . It 's closed sir . It 's closed ? How is it closed ? We just want to go inside there . Just walk around a little . - - No more . - It 's closed ? Yes , it 's impossible . David , it 's okay . I got to see it from the outside . It 's good enough . - - She came all the way to go inside . - Hey , come on . Sorry , it 's .. I don 't know . - - Tchau . - Tchau . Millie ! - - Come on . - What ? Come on , I will give you a private tour . It 's closed . We can 't just break into the Coliseum . Who said it 's closed . The door is open . Want to see the Coliseum or not ? - - Come on . - I told you not to do it . This place is amazing . I want you to see this . You 've got to admit , it 's worth the risk . Yes It 's so cool . Down here is where they used to keep the Gladiators and the lions , in cages . We should go down there . Can 't go down there . It 's off limits . Nothing is off limits . What ? Millie ! That door , just opened too ? It 's open now . Yes You will want to see this . Trust me . - - This should worth something . - Maybe . I think it is telling you , do not enter . You speak Italian ? No . - - Lingresso means , come on . - Oh , I thought it meant push it . That means you should stay here , while I go around and open from the other side . It 's okay , I catch up . Thank you very much . Next show will be at six o 'clock . Don 't forget to tip cash . What ? A little busy ? Yes , I can understand that . No matter . Wouldn 't open the door if I were you . Not if I want my girlfriend to keep breathing . But that 's just me . What are you going to do anyway ? Going to bring her down for a nice little Roman picnic ? Nice little tea party . Because nothing is going to happen . If you as much as look at her .. What are you going to do ? Going to jump me where ? Did you think you are the only one ? You really have no idea ? You live the life you live . You think you go on a Roman holiday and they wouldn 't notice ? Just jump all over the place . Jump , jump , jump , jump ... And nothing is going to happen ? But they 've noticed . Not me . I am not talking about me . It 's them , down there . Hi , boys . Just me then . That 's new ? Welcome to the War . Let me know if you boys get tired . Close ! David ? What is going on ? Right . Let 's meet the girlfriend shall we ? No . - - Who are these people ? - Palades . Palades kill jumpers . I kill Palades . Case dismissed . Oh my God ! What we doing ? Police ! Police ! Police ! Wait ! I just came through your jump slot . What do you think you 're doing here ? If I were you , I will jump right back . You are not supposed to see all these stuff . You are not supposed to be here . Get out . So would you kindly f .. k off . As in now . Maybe your girlfriend is still alive . - - Hey ! - Hey . What happened to you ? Nothing , Let 's go . I think we should get out of here . I heard these sounds like nothing ? You were right . I shouldn 't have gone down there . Everything 's fine , come on . We can still make it to the museum . David , will you talk to me ? - There should be a cab somewhere . Where are you taking me ? Will you please talk to me ? I will tell you everything back at the hotel , okay ? - I am not waiting for the hotel . - - Millie , it is all fine . - No , it 's not all fine . Alright , we should go back then . We are the police , stop . Don 't understand . Did you intrude into the Coliseum ? We made a big mistake . Looking for that girl over there . They are the ones ! - I know that ns ... I am sorry . I know I am not supposed to be back there . Be calm , calm ... Can 't you just let us off with a warning ? Okay , okay ... - - Millie , just go back to the hotel , okay ? - No ! No , no , no , no we are together . - - I am with him . - I don 't know her . - - Millie , go back to the hotel . - No . I told you . I want to see Millie . Where is the body ? I didn 't do anything . How many times must I say the same thing ? Do you know how much longer he 's going to be back there ? We will wait for the Magistrar . I know , we have been waiting for the Magistrar all night . Lady , be patient and wait . I don 't know your language . I don 't know what you are saying . Now you sit or we will sit you . - - Okay , I sit . - Sit ! She has got nothing to do with this . Pedro , the Magistrar is here . Right Valdir . The Magistrar is here . We will hold on to your passport . No worry . You wouldn 't need it where you are going . Hello , David . You only have 30 seconds before they come through the door . Do you understand ? You have to get out of here . Ditch the girl . She 's weak , she 'll be dead . - Mum , mum ! 20 seconds , David . Mum , mum ! Millie ! Well done . Free to walk . They just let you go ? - Yes , they let me go . Just like that ? Just like that . If they let you go . Why are we running ? They strongly suggested we leave town now . What did they say to you ? - Asked me some questions . For 8 hours ? There are a lot of questions . I really want to believe you , but it is getting extremely difficult . Millie , just trust me . Let 's go . Can you take us ? Get in the cab , Millie . Millie , get in the car . Please , please get in the cab . Yours . Remember I told you , you need not tell me everything . I changed my mind . What is in the bag pack ? Where did you get that ? I don 't want to lie to you . But you don 't want to tell me the truth either . I can 't go on this flight with you , Millie . This is as far as we go together . To Detroit ? - - Roland . We lost him , sir . - - How many men did you sent ? - Two men . I told you to send everybody . She said two would be enough . But they missed . Looks like they knew we were coming . We are searching through the grid now . Keep me informed . I am taking a different tact . - - William Rice ? - Yes IOS . Can we go inside and talk ? I don 't have to ask . That is a courtesy . What is this all about ? Your son , David . Why ? Is he in some kind of trouble ? This will a lot swifter if you let me ask the questions . When was the last time you saw your son ? Eight years ago . - - Eight years ? - That 's right . What about friends ? Anybody I can talk to ? He didn 't have a whole lot of friends . I would like to talk to David 's mother if I could ? Me too . You find her tell her I said hello . That 's her ? Mary Rice , at least that was her name back then . When was the last time you saw her ? She split when the kid turned five . Haven 't heard a word since . If I hear anything , I will be sure to give you a hauler . - - No , you won 't . - No , I won 't . You specially move it doing this new thing though ... It 's like the better this new control ... You see that ? Still alive ? I 'm hit . He 's dead . What ? There are more of them ? Hundreds more . I am tracking ten right now . Why do you care ? There are lots more . And what about the rest ? - What about the rest ? Like I said , I hunt them . - - Who are these guys ? - I told you , the palades . You told me the name . Didn 't tell me what they want . That 's pretty simple . All is dead . Didn 't you figure that out yet ? - - Yeah , I got that one . - I am glad . Do you mind just move ... Why ? Because we can do the hell we want ! Now , can you please , ... . I 'm hit . He 's dead . There . Thanks . You really don 't get it , do you ? Paladins have been killing jumpers for years . Way back since medieval times . The fanatics , religious nut jobs , inquisitions , witch hunts , that was then . Look , they are smart . They are fast and organized . No matter what they 'll kill anyone that gets in their way . Like your family , your friends , that girlfriend that you travelled around in Rome with you . They are dead . All of them . Get use to it . It 's a matter of time . I am going to get some tacs . Do you want some ? Somebody get some help ! - - Help ! - What happened ? What is happening here ? Call an cardiologist here , now ! A bed ! Okay ? Just stay here . I am not getting a pulse . What the hell happened ? Mark ! What did you tell him ? How did they know about Ann Arbor ? Stay the hell away from me ! - What did you say ? Black , white hair . What 's his name ? Roland . Just answer the questions . Or I 'll drop you off at the top of Mount Everest , okay ? - - What did you tell him ? - What ? I , don 't know ... What ? I know you told him about home . I know you told him about Ann Arbor . Did you tell him about Millie . I told him everything . What ? Why did you do that ? - Why not ? Who are you ! - - Where did the paladin go ? - Swimming . - - Pacific ? - No actually , Atlantic . Nice shark pit in Cuba . What do you think you are doing ? Put that stuff back ! Actually I need to borrow a few things . You just stay away from the wall ! Keep our eyes out ! - - I need to find Roland . - No you don 't . I only got eight hours . The plane lands in eight hours . This stuff is not going to help you . This stuff is like four years old . May be you should jump back to high school . So that you learn something . I have been tracking you for 10 years . Take a look at this . You see this ? Our first round in Nepal . You should see what they gave me back in Prague . Forget it . Forget about Roland , Don 't waste your time . Just leave it to me . - - Do you mind ? - Look ... Can I have a little privacy here ? This is kind of my thing . Just .. turn around . I was thinking if we do this together . We can get him . You mean , like you and me ? - - Yes - Like we team-up ? Yes Look I am sorry . But I don 't play well with others . Do me a favour . Don 't be here when I get back . Find a rock . Crawl under it . Stay there . Choiwu , brother . That 's goodbye in Chinese . You can 't keep following me . - Actually , I am the only person who can . Yeah , lucky me . Why are you walking ? I know Tokyo pretty well . I 've got a lot of jump sites here . I like walking for a change . Makes me feel normal . - - You read Marvel 's Team-Up ? - Yes I read it , several times . Two superheroes , join forces , like a limited run . I see what you are trying to do ? I am not buying it . For your own sake , go home . - - You live in a cave ! - It 's call a Lab ! What is the point ? To say , we have this common thing . I don 't know where to find Roland . So we 're doing this or what ? Sorry the car got stuck . Doing it solo . I am not getting rid of you , am I ? - - Oh , oh ! - You might want to hold on son . That was close . Not bad . This thing must be two tons , easy . Are you a ... If it moves , I can jump it . Actually I met this Jumper once ... Crazy bastard , tried to up the whole building . Won 't be trying that again . - Why is that ? Because he is dead . It killed him . Still managed to shake a lot . - - How long have you been doing this ? - Doing what ? Driving ? No , jumping . Since I was five . - - Five ? - Yes How do you keep it a secret from people ? Like your parents ? It 's pretty easy when they are not around . - - Where were they ? - Not around . My mum took off when I was five . I know what it is like to not .. you know . My dad ... I didn 't ask you about your family . We are not in Oprah , you know . Dude I can 't be doing this . I have to go . Her flight lands any second . I need an answer . This is it . Are we a team ? Now or never . A very limited run right ? Save her . Kill him . We are done . I hope so . The flight landed an hour ago . Ah , no ... You didn 't check on the flight . We got to find her . You go and find her . I am going to arm up . Meet me back at the lab . - - Alright ? - Fine . What are you looking at ? Hey , I am Millie 's friend , David . Is she here ? Last I checked , she was with you . Hey , your friend came by . - - What are you talking about ? - Black guy , white hair . You just missed him . - - Jesus . - Hey . David , what the hell are you doing here ? I buzzed , but you didn 't pick up . So you just broke in ? Yes , I need to make sure you are okay . No David . I am not okay . I got lost at the airport in Rome . I am sorry . You are sorry . Thank you . I think you should leave . David , you need to leave . Come on , we don 't have much time . What are you doing ? David , I told you to leave . What ? I am not in banking , okay . No , really ? The money did came from a bank , you know . A few banks actually . You are telling me you are a bank robber ? Small part . Will you please get out of my house ? Millie , I am sorry . - - Millie sorry , we got to go . - Leave me alone . Come on ! This might hurt a little okay ? It 's okay . Trust me , okay ? ... I am not going to hurt you . Don 't you even come near me . I am going to explain everything . They are here . - - Just stay where you are . - David ! Hurry up . It is closing . Griffin . There is something I have got to tell you . So did you find her ? - -Something is going to piss you off a little bit . - Piss me off ? David ? What is this ? David ? What is she doing here ? - - This is not some kind of club house you know ? - David , what is going on ? - - Millie , I told you to stay inside . - Maybe you take her to Mount Everest , Maybe the bottom . I don 't know . It 's up to you . Griffin listen me alright ? I was just trying to tell you okay . By bringing her down , they can follow you . They have a machine . Can open the worm hole and keep it open . What are you talking about ? I am saying that they can follow us anywhere . And you brought her here . Follow you ? David what is going on ? - - Millie , stay here . - No ! What have you done ? Where does this go ? David , what did you do ? Oh shit ! Mum ? Thanks for leading me to your friend . Wait , wait , wait ! Why are you doing this to me ? ! I never hurt you , not hurt anybody . Not yet . You will . Sooner or later . You all go bad . What if I am different ? You are not different . - I am different ! Time to send you home to mama . - - David ? - Millie . David ? Millie get out of here , run . Millie , Millie , run ! Run ! I am going to get you down , so you can get me out of here . Really . Can you take me back , please ? Ok , I will take you . I will leave you alone . There was always you . Ever since we were five . There was always you . Please take me . Take a deep breath . I got him ! They are trapped in there . We open this machine , they are screwed ! - - Got her ! - No ! - - Millie ! Crap . I didn 't expect it . I didn 't know . Now they will have to come at us . Get this fire out . - - What is that ? - What ? What are you doing ? Nothing . I was thinking of going bowling . What ? Roland is there with his whole army . I am going back there with this and blow them up to Timbuktu . Millie is in there . We got the risk as well . I got to go get her . Griffin , it is my fault Millie is there . We got to get her out of there . We have to get her out of there . I can hear you . I am not deaf . I understand what you are saying . I can actually hear you . Got your point . But you know what ? We ought to make sacrifices once in a while . Where is the detonator ? Did you make any ? I have made mine . I was five . He came into my house and killed my parents . David , David . Look before the two of us get out of hands , let 's talk . How about this for talking ? Get this message through to you ! As you can no longer do that . If you touch this again , I am going to kill you . You got it ? Give me the detonator David ! Give it back ! Sorry , Griffin ! Give it back ! Don 't . You ! The Chenian . Where did he go ? I guess that 's where it all runs down . The electricity trick . That 's nice . Thanks . Cut me down . We can finish this right ? It didn 't have to be this way . There is five of them back there . If you go back alone there you are dead . You hear me ? You can 't win . David don 't David ! You do this alone , you are dead . You are not a hero , David ! You a Jumper , not a saviour of girls . Don 't you get it ? Move ! Got him ! Stop saying you can 't jump David ! Only God should have this power . Not you , David . David , I am so sorry for what I said before . Take a deep breath . David ? Hey ! Hey ! David ? David ! I am sorry , sorry . My sink and washer are in the library . David ! I am impressed . - - Stay here , okay ? - What ? Come a long way from robbing banks . I told you I am different . Good job with the shots . Hi . Can I help you ? Is Mary here ? Hey mum ! Honey , go upstairs ? - - You know , it wasn 't easy finding you . - You shouldn 't be here . So it 's true . You are one of them . Yes , it 's true . You were 5 years old when you had your first jump . I only had two choices . Kill you , or you leave . So you left . To protect you . I was five . I did what I had to do . I never stop thinking about you . Even for one day . So I am a Jumper , And you are a Paladin . That 's right . What now ? I am giving you a head start son . Because I love you . Good luck . - -You okay ? - Yes Are you sure ? Yes , I am . Good , because I am freezing ! Can we please go to some place warmer ? - - Where do you want to go ? - Surprise me !

 Get his description circulated . How ? He hasn 't done anything yet . One less than yesterday . I love you . I love you too , but not enough . It 's like some being is allowing us a glimpse of what 's to come . God 's talking to Manchester ? This is a hoax , right ? There were eight images . HE COUGHS Need any help ? No ! In this image , Jack 's dead . We changed the future . He never learns how close he came to dying . It 's not over . How do you know , Christian ? HE EXHALES SHARPLY No . SHE SIGHS No ! It 's my birthday . DOOR OPENS , CLOSES COMPUTER BEEPS RAPIDLY CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO Gunshot wound to the chest . A paramedic pronounced at the scene . Do we have a suspect ? Lance Carol . Nobody saw anything , of course . God . Ben , I walk into a room , you walk out . What 's that about ? I thought that 's how you wanted it . Well , it 's tough for the three of us . We should be supporting ... Don 't worry about me . I 've got my kids , a life . Sorry . I 'm sorry . We saw the future , Rebecca . And that 's quite a big ... I mean , personally speaking , I wish we hadn 't . And your answer 's been to avoid me ? Well , for Christ 's sake , a hole in space sent us messages . I mean , forgive me if I find it a bit Armageddon . Armageddon is the final battle between God and Satan . If the bloody thing jams open , you never know who might come through . THEY BOTH CHUCKLE FOOTSTEPS APPROACH I 've just had a text from Prometheus . MOBILE PHONES BEEP Shit . Seven images ? The same as last time . 27 / 06 . That was yesterday . If it 's the date . 27 / 06 could be the recording date , not an indication of when the event takes place . The assumption should be the clock 's ticking unless proved otherwise . It 's been a fortnight since the last images came down . Why the gap ? No images were generated or perhaps we simply failed to capture them . I 'm sure you appreciate you 're still bound by the Official Secrets Act . As far as your police colleagues are aware , you 're investigating science fraud on a day-to-day basis - cover name , Operation Talisman . Who does know about this ? The decision is not to concern other parties unnecessarily until , Christian , we know exactly what it is we 're dealing with . I want the surveillance camera removed . Yes , of course . You 're in early . Katie kick you out ? Dumped her . Jesus . Why ? " Love you , Gerry . " Next it 'll be , " What time do you call this ? " " Where you going ? " It 's for the best . Nobody 's hurt . Only seven images ? Or eight ? What are you hiding ? Another image of a dead Ben ? Or is it my turn to snuff it ? I 'm hiding nothing . Why should I believe you ? You lied to me last time . On the evidence , you 've absolutely no reason to believe me . OK , convince me . There are only seven images . Any luck finding your wormhole ? It 's not mine . The images arrived at 4 : 32 . Following the usual timescale , the event will take place at 22 : 32 . We have 12 hours and 34 minutes . I caught the word " we " . They have to be sent for a reason . There is no evidence that they were SENT . All that is known is they were transmitted back to us from the satellite . The images aren 't random . Both times , they 've led us to a major event . They have to be deliberately chosen . And if they 're chosen , then somebody ... .. some other being has to be behind it . Is one interpretation . Right ear - male , female ? Lightish skin tone . Not necessarily . The image appears overexposed . No earring . The injury ? Entry into the external carotid artery . Without swift intervention , victim bleeds to death . I 've seen one before . Could a stiletto heel make that wound ? The entry site 's been damaged , indicating more than one blow . In theory , with enough force , yes . PHONE RINGS ANSWERPHONE : ' Katie here . Leave a message . ' BEEP 'Hi . It 's Russell . 'Jenny told me . 'Look , I ... I 'll catch you later . 'Um , I hope you 're all right . 'Oh , happy birthday , by the way . ' ANSWERPHONE BEEPS Holly 's . Is that someone 's shadow ? Could be . Nail bar , beauty salon , hairdresser - there can 't be that many . A handbag . Designer handbag ? Not my area of expertise . If there was or is to be an incident , obviously a woman 's involved . A high heel with what looks like blood . Several reasons you break a heel - caught between the cracks of a paving stone , running , running away . Maybe she 's running away from an assailant . Maybe she IS the assailant . Check out male , female assaults and fatalities in Manchester last night . We need to eliminate them . Aerial shot ? ! The tree 's uprooted . Earth shrinkage ? It 's fallen across something . A car , possibly ? " Eternity " ? Time , regarded as having no beginning and no end - everlasting . A timeless existence after death ? A bloody long time . Yellow and blue squares . Stuart ?

How come the ... Sorry . DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES Tension in the dressing room ? The image of the tree . An aerial shot at night . That 's rare , isn 't it ?

This is ... this is what ? A joke ? HE MOUTHS When is it ? The last time , just after you placed your hand on the live wire . What ... ? I 'm dead ? ! Somewhere . Yes . You didn 't think to warn me ? I was about to die and it slipped your mind ? I thought I was protecting you . Protecting me would have been locking me in a cell . Stupid idea . Couldn 't risk spoiling the great experiment . I withheld the image . She knew you knew . Towards the end , yeah . The MoD ? You didn 't die , Ben . Oh , great ( ! ) Thank you for that ( ! ) You 're playing with people 's lives . What , you think you 're God now ? You 've no idea , have you , how excited you get - how obscene that is ? Why did ... You denied me the opportunity to say goodbye to my kids . Oh , Ben ... My life , my death . What the hell were you doing ? What ? Expect I 'd run away ? We 'll tell the MoD I don 't need you . I 'm not making this easy for you . I promise I 've concealed nothing else from either of you . 'According to Christian , only seven images arrived this time . 'I believe him . 'At the moment we assume this is an extremely violent possible sexual assault on a woman . I suggest you visit yesterday 's victim . Lucy Roberts ? Make absolutely certain that she 's not the person in the image . HE UNLOCKS CAR HE BREATHES HEAVILY This is unprecedented , Callum . I have to make difficult decisions .

I 'm sorry - I 'm late . I was supposed to liaise with my uniformed colleagues . I realise Lucy 's had a terrifying night . Do you think she 'd feel up to clarifying a few details for me ? Anything that might help us catch this bastard ? HE UNLOCKS CAR ENGINE STARTS You don 't trust me either ? I thought you might appreciate the company . Your car 's over there . Dr King allowed DS Holt to see the image of his own death . Is he deliberately trying to sabotage the team ? No , of course not . It was an accident . He should be in the control room . Where 's he going ? Thanks so much , Mrs Roberts . HE UNLOCKS CAR MOBILE PHONE RINGS Yep ? 'Lucy Roberts ? ' Night-hiker . Man claiming to be a mini-cab driver . Something about the description ...

Operation Talisman . We 're interested in sex offenders in your books , excluding paedophiles . The MO of the offender may include carrying a weapon , wounding ... I 've only one fits that profile . Stuart Taylor . Rape . Stabbed his victim in the face with a steel nailfile . What did he get ? He served seven of ten . He 's been out a month . Victim 's name ? Paula Wilby . What 's Taylor like ? He 's a fantasist . Poor social awareness . He was cautioned before attacking Paula , but he was judged not to be dangerous . A woman looks at him , he interprets it as a come-on . When did you last see him ? This morning . He was due to be on a behavioural programme . He responds better in a structured framework . Unfortunately , the class was cancelled . You just let him walk out ? As opposed to what ? Chaining him to the radiator ( ? ) His behavioural therapist - did a tree come down near their house ? Sally - treatment manager ? Yeah . Smashed her car . A write-off , apparently . How did you know ? What street does she live on ? Tullwood . Is that relevant ? Do you know what " team " means ? Hmm . A number of people working together on a common task ? Two or more draught animals harnessed together ? How did you know about the tree ? It was a guess . You never just guess . It was an educated guess . I have to be somewhere and I can 't take you with me . SHE DIALS PHONE 'Hello ?

I use the computer between 3pm and 5pm . Not on a Friday . It 's not my fault if the course was cancelled . Your name 's down for tomorrow . That 's not the point . There 's a group discussion in five minutes if you 've got any problems . I don 't have any problems . You might find it interesting , Stuart . DOORBELL RINGS Paula ? My name is DI Flint . Rebecca . I 'd like to talk to you about Stuart Taylor . Why ? I believe that in just under seven hours Taylor will seriously assault and rape again . I was hoping something ... anything I learnt from you may help me stop him . Thank you . I was walking through Felix Park . It was a lovely warm evening . I glanced at a man sitting on a bench . I remember thinking , " You must be hot . " I don 't usually take the alley down to the road , but just this once . I heard footsteps . They were speeding up . An arm came round my throat . This smell , cheap aftershave . Next I 'm on the ground . The man from the bench was on top of me . I was screaming . My bag was on the ground , everything spilling out . He picked up a nailfile , metal nailfile , drove it through my cheek , speared my tongue to the bottom of my mouth . It was over in seconds . Then afterwards ... Afterwards , he did this thing . What ? Tidied my hair . There was hair in my eyes . He tidied it . Are you still angry ? Every day . Me too . See you . PHONE BEEPS Oi ! Been at the mini-cabbing again , Ed ? What ? Lucy Roberts . Lovely girl . Reminds me of my daughter . This time I 'm having you , you filthy little shit . Go on , try it . Can 't touch me . I 'm immortal .

Taylor 's our assailant . Have you checked out his hostel ? I 'm on it . But it may harm your defence if you do not mention ... I 'm not coming . It 's your birthday party . You 've got to be there . If you 're worried about Gerry , I 'll sort him . I just feel stupid and miserable . The party 's paid for . Just tell everyone to go ahead and have a great time . This is crazy . I 'll be OK , honest . HE SIGHS Have you ever seen the aurora of Jupiter 's north pole ? An ultraviolet image of Jupiter 's north pole . It 's ultraviolet . Businesses using ultraviolet lighting . Looks like Stuart 's left . Do you want me to tell him that you called ? If you could just ring me when he returns ? Has he committed an offence ? No . Then I don 't feel comfortable spying on him . " Trust in the Lord . He shall direct your way . " I 'm looking for Stuart Taylor . Sorry , you just missed him . Shit . Are you sure ? Only he told me he was in room 12 . Room 1 . Room 3 , mate , please . Cheers . HE SNIFFS PHONE RINGS DOOR ENTRY BUZZES Yeah ? Becky Stone . I rang earlier about hiring a room for a private works do . To the right . There 's a party tonight . Midweeks are easier to book at short notice . My mate Stuart Taylor recommended you . Do you know him ? No . Not a regular . Well , perhaps you remember our friend Louise , always goes clubbing in pink stiletto heels . So many girls come here . Dark lighting . Besides , who 's looking at their feet ? It 's a hand stamp for re-admission . It 's ultraviolet . Turn on the torch . It 's still yesterday 's date . I haven 't changed it yet . If the image is the back of a hand , we 're too late . Whoever it belongs to was here yesterday . No authority to access CCTV , not enough time to go through it ... Maybe Taylor 's already attacked her . Not necessarily . Club stamps are hard to wash off . You were a clubber ? Yeah . Any reason why I shouldn 't be ? Where have you been ? Arresting Ed Fields for attempted sexual assault on Lucy Roberts . I ordered you to track down Taylor , not meddle in another case . Lucy Roberts was attacked . I got the bastard who did it . Ed Fields . I thought you 'd empathise with that . Are you deliberately trying to sabotage this ? Oh , for Christ 's sake . So where 's Taylor ? I checked his room . It 's clean . Where is Stuart Taylor , Ben ? A serial sex offender is off the street . And another one is out there . This isn 't about solving crimes . Not even about keeping people alive . It 's about you and your ego . I spoke to Taylor 's victim . I saw the scar on her face . An inch closer and he 'd have taken her eye out . HE SIGHS I understand it 's personal . You know things about me , Ben . You do not know me . 'Taylor 's victim mentioned the smell of aftershave . ' There was a smell in his room . Cheap aftershave . Oh , Ben . Get his description circulated . How ? He hasn 't done anything yet . DOOR OPENS Any sign of him ? No . I accessed Taylor 's profile . He always stayed within a three-mile radius of where he was living . That would include Holly 's . Go back there . Were any of the women at Eternity last night ? Take a picture of Taylor . Do they recognise him ? What 's in the box ? The cake . But guess what ? She 's not coming . She 's not coming to her own party . Sorry , that 's , uh ... I 'll give her a ring . You don 't talk to her again . No wonder you never stay in one place . I made some calls . Jesus , man . All those women . What about them ? They were off their faces . What are you going to say next ? They asked for it ? Begged , mate . Begged . I was joking . Things got out of hand for a little while . Mixed signals . My mistake . Nothing 's happened again . Ask Katie . You leave her alone . She doesn 't want you anywhere near her . Understand ? Sure .

I haven 't told anyone . 'Please . Come tonight . ' You don 't know this , but you 're a very special person . Just give me a chance . Thank you very much . Bye . Hey , it 's my guardian angel . Do you know this man ? Have you noticed him hanging around ? No . Who is he ? Just someone we 're interested in . If you see him , ring me immediately , OK ? OK . Were you or any members of your staff at the club Eternity last night ? No , just some drinks after work and then we shared a cab home . What are you doing tonight ? Working . Cashing up . I wasn 't ... That sounded ... It 's my job ... To keep us safe . It 's fine . I 'm really grateful . It 's not often the police round here give us much respect . Understand ? Yeah . You 're a good man . Bless you . Right . Thanks . Well ? No sign of Taylor at the drop-in centre or the hostel . No-one at Holly 's salon recognises Taylor . They weren 't at Eternity nightclub last night . That doesn 't rule him out . Maybe Taylor 's the one with the stamped hand . Anyone could have a bloody stamp . Assailant , victim , witness . This is crap policing . Why are we assuming it 's Taylor ? The yellow and blue squares . He raped a woman and stabbed her through the face . Did you check out the guys at Eternity ? Jesus , you 're fixated just cos you want it to be Taylor . I don 't want it to ... Is it me ? You 're the assailant ? What if I , we , are the mechanism that inadvertently provokes the incident ? Last time ... Last time I annoyed Ben , I sent him away . As a result , he comes within a fraction of dying . What if it 's my investigations that are somehow triggering it ? We walk away , back off , the assault doesn 't happen ? You 've been part of this process since you arrived this morning . Here 's a radical thought . Let 's stop the process ! Now you 're feeling sorry for yourself . In less than two hours , a woman is going to be savagely attacked , probably raped , bleeding to death , possibly because of me . What do I do , Christian ? Tomorrow morning there 's a report . " Woman found . Fatal wound to right external carotid artery . " Which is the bigger risk - do something or do nothing ? That 's the nature of knowledge . There 's no way back . Gerry Mortimer . Employee at Eternity . I met him . He moves around a lot . I spoke to one of his previous employers . Allegations of date rape . Was he charged ? No . Women were drunk . He claimed it was consensual . Then why would he have had anything to do with Outcome Initiatives ? He went there with a mate , he 's shagging one of the staff , I don 't know . Gerry Mortimer , please . He 's on his break , mate . Can I help ? 'Do you know where he 's gone ? I 've got money I owe him . ' Um ... cafe . Cardwell St , I think . OK . Ta . He 's on a break , allegedly . Did you check Gerry Mortimer 's hand ? He works there . Why would he need a stamp ? He was bored , messing about . I 'll see if I can track him down . Late-night closing , Fridays . Maybe he 's heading to Holly 's . Whatever happens happens outside Holly 's . MAN : " Hello ? " . DI Flint . I 'm enquiring about Stuart Taylor . Oh , he 's not here . I told you , if he comes back I 'll call you . CHATTER ON TWO-WAY RADIO Bye . See ya ! CHATTER ON RADIO CONTINUES Where the flower was , it 's yellow . If the leather is brown ... The handle appears a strange consistency . Marzipan melting in the heat . It 's a cake . A designer cake . Not a handbag . " Happy birthday , Katie " , maybe ? The Eternity stamp ...

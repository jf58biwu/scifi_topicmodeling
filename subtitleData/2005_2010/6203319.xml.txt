 That shooting star could be a space rock . But it could be a ship . They might be friendly and they might not . Like the Slitheen . They wanted to drain our sun 's energy and leave the Earth a dead ball of ice . But we stopped them . Sarah Jane , Luke , Clyde and me . I remember the blackout . The paper said it was a reversal of the Earth 's magnetic something . - Mr Smith put that into the news releases . - Sarah Jane 's computer . Which branch of PC World did that come from ? He 's alien . I don 't know where from . - Not sure if Sarah Jane knows . - Right . Clyde realised we could use vinegar against the Slitheen . - You heard her ! - Most of them teleported back to the ship . - Maria , you 're 14 . - Dad , the world would have died . I 'm your father . You never thought I should know about any of this ? It was difficult , especially after you got turned to stone . - Beg your pardon ? - Dad ! Dad ! - There was this Gorgon ... - Just give me a minute here . I know how you feel . I remember when I saw that alien in Sarah Jane 's garden . Sarah Jane used to fly around in space with this guy . - The Doctor . - And Luke 's an alien ? Not alien . He just isn 't quite human . The Bane made him . - This is serious stuff . - You 're not going to tell Mum ? Like she 'd believe me . Like I 'd believe me if I hadn 't been bumping between realities and seen us almost flattened by a meteor . No . I 'm not going to tell your mother . - I 'm putting this house on the market . - What ? You can 't ! This isn 't kids ' stuff . It 's dangerous . We 're going to have to move . Just on Orion 's shoulder . Do you see , Luke ? That 's where they 'll come . Sarah Jane ! Dad says we 're moving ! He says I can 't have anything to do with you . - He says it 's too dangerous . - It is dangerous . - That 's not the point . - No parent wants to see their child in danger . I know your father has a lot to worry about . You can 't blame him . - But if you talk to him ... - What would I say ? Tell him about the magic , how wonderful it is , the universe . Perhaps it is . You said it . It 's not all stars and moonlight . Well , sometimes things from space are scary , but how 's that so different from Earth ? And sometimes things from space are amazing and you realise how incredible it all is . We 're part of something so much bigger than living here on Bannerman Road . Life is so much more than most people will ever know . And I 've been really lucky , Dad . I 've seen that and I can 't give it up . - This is too much to take in . - That 's the universe , Alan . Once it 's chosen to show you its secrets , you can 't turn your back . None of us can . No . I suppose not . I 've got a lot to get used to , haven 't I ? The Kalazian Lights are about to appear ! The last time they were visible from Earth was 4,000 years ago . The universe is smiling on us tonight . Let 's hope it always does . It 's been five months since we saw Ashley , but we pray every night that he 's out there somewhere , unharmed , and that he 'll come back to us soon . If you 're out there , Ashley , just call your mum and dad , please . If the human race is going to survive climate change , you have to give it a hand . Not to mention my electricity bill . What have you done with the remote ? If you can 't have children of your own , if that 's why you 've taken him , because you 're lonely , how do you think I feel without my angel boy ? - They look worried sick . - There 's things here on Earth that make your blood run cold . If anybody knows where Ashley is , please contact the police . Please . Isn 't that Luke ? No ! Can 't be ! Luke , it 's you ! The police are stepping up their campaign . Whoever 's got him , you might think you 're caring for him , you might think you love him , but he belongs with us , his mum and dad . But you 're my mum . Mr Smith , I need you , more than ever . I have been monitoring the news . - It can 't be true . Luke was created by the Bane to absorb human brain patterns . Did they model him on this missing boy ? - I need to scan Luke . - No ! The Bane made me . I don 't remember anyone before I woke up in the Bane 's laboratory . Then I met Maria . - Hello . - Um , hello . And I met you . - What are you doing here ? - I could ask you the same . Who 's he ? What have they done to you ? It 's all right , Luke . But we have to be sure . This won 't hurt at all , Luke . - Well ? - I am assessing . Assessment complete . My scan and DNA cross-reference - with available medical records are concluded . - And ? - I have a genetic match . - What ? - Luke and Ashley are the same person . - There must be some mistake . - I don 't make mistakes . - The Bane made me ! You know they did ! This doesn 't make sense . Luke was never born . He doesn 't have a navel . Bane society , being egg-born , find the navel offensive . They would have surgically removed it . But you 're my mum . Mr Smith , is there any chance at all ? Chances of DNA mismatch , approximately four billion to one . I told you there was something not right about Contrary Jane and that son of hers . It 's a mistake . It can 't be Luke . - And why 's that ? - It just can 't . - Let the police make up their minds , shall we ? - The police ? - You never called the police ? - I 've told you , there 's something wrong . - I can smell it on her . - Mum ! No ! I 've told you , she 's a weirdo . You 'll see . - Sarah Jane Smith ? - He 's here . Will you just give me a minute , please ? What 's going to happen ? The police will take us to the station . They 'll question me and you 'll see your parents . So why can 't I remember them ? I know all sorts of things . Quantum theory , Magnusark 's Law of Hyper Dimensional Relativity . I can remember every page I 've ever read . So why can 't I remember them ? I wish I had all the answers . I know this is difficult . You must know I do . But this isn 't a bad day . Mr and Mrs Stafford , they love you . - But don 't you love me ? - I do . But you don 't belong with me . Your mum and dad have spent months searching for you . The Bane took you away and broke their hearts . Today is a wonderful day . They 're going to get you back . You are going to be an ordinary boy with parents that care for you and won 't ever let anything bad happen to you , the way I never could . And it 's the best day of your life , too . You 'll see . - So it 's right then ? It is Luke . - Wake up . How can it be Luke ? - What , you mean the belly ... - Look , it 's the mum and dad . Don 't be nervous . It 's going to be okay . They 're your real parents . - Here she comes , Calamity Jane . - Everything 's going to be fine . Ashley ! Thank God you 're all right ! - Oh my baby ! My beautiful baby boy ! - Are you really my mother ? - Was I born from your womb ? - Ashley ? What are you ... - Of course I 'm your mother . - Don 't you remember us ? - No . - What have you done to him ? - Mrs Stafford , please ! - Mum , this is all your fault ! - I don 't go round kidnapping young boys . - Chrissie , for goodness sake . I haven 't harmed him . I swear to you . He lost his memory . I had no idea he had parents looking for him . You thought the fairies had left him ? You make me sick ! I think we 'd better talk this through at the station . Don 't you , Miss Smith ? - Dad , do something . - You wait till it gets to court . - Goodness knows what secrets she 's been hiding . - Just leave it . There 's nothing we can do , darling . Mum , no ! Come on . Let 's get you home , yeah ? Seems you 've got powerful friends . My friends have nothing to do with it . - I know a cover-up when I smell one . - I assume your attitude means I 'm free to go . You can go . But don 't go near that boy again . In you go , son . Home sweet home . - We 've got Spurs on Wednesday , Ashley . - Spurs ? You and me , watching the match . Come on , Lampard ! Eh ? - Football . You remember football , don 't you ? - I don 't like football . Don 't like ? What did that woman do to him ? I suppose I used to like peppers as well , did I ? I 'm tired . I 'd like to go to my room now , please . Some people get concerned about pruning their plants . You shouldn 't be . All plants want to do is grow . Xylok , are you there ? We 've got the boy . Sarah Jane . Luke has gone back to his parents , where he belongs . And they are his parents . Mr Smith confirmed it . The Bane kidnapped him , did things to him . I got it wrong . Not the first time . - I 'm really sorry . - It 's for the best . I 'm not cut out to be a parent . - Children have no place in my life . - You don 't mean that . I told you , my life is dangerous . I can 't have other people to worry about . They 're a distraction . These few months , I 've been lucky . - That can 't hold up forever . - What are you saying ? Tell your dad he was right . He should put the house on the market . And he , you and Clyde should forget about me and everything you 've seen . How are we going to do that ? What happened to never turning your back ? Sometimes you have to . Sometimes it 's the only way to survive . Sarah Jane . - I didn 't call you . - Perhaps you don 't realise that you need me . - Yeah , I don 't . Not tonight . You need a purpose . All things in the universe need a purpose . - Without purpose , we cease to be . - What are you talking about ? I 've been monitoring experiments at the Pharos Institute . Look , I 'm not really interested . They have been carrying out research in telekinetic energy . Pharos was set up 20 years ago to study paranormal phenomena . They 've been running experiments in mind over matter . With little success . Now they have developed a way to harness telekinetic energy . - How ? - They are using alien technology . - Then maybe I should pay them a visit . - My thoughts exactly . And this time , I won 't have any children to slow me down . Good morning . Did you sleep well ? - Why did you lock my door ? - You ran away once , remember ? Why would I run away from home ? Well , since you 've lost your memory , we 'll never find out , will we ? You can forget about school . You 're staying here . - I want to see my friends . - Maria and Clyde ? How do you know their names ? I never mentioned them . It don 't matter . You won 't see ' em again . So that 's it ? No more monsters . No more saving the world . - She 's devastated . - She 's not the only one hurting , is she ? - Where is Luke ? - His parents live in Hammersmith . I suppose Luke ... Ashley will go back to his old school . That 's the last we see of him , too ? I 'd just got him listening to Kasabian . I was going to move on to Arctic Monkeys . Could have had him passing for cool . Maybe Ashley is cool . Maybe he 's a completely different person to Luke . The Bane must have really messed him up . I bet finding out he 's got a real mum and dad messed him up more . - I hope he 's all right . - Why don 't we find out ? - Have you got the address ? - It was in the papers , I think . - Then come on . - The bell 's going to go any minute . Look , if my days of fighting aliens are over , it looks like sneaking off lessons is all the excitement I 'm going to get . - Maria , where do you think you are going ? - I was going to the library . You 're supposed to be in my French class . Depechez-vous . Thank you for seeing me , Professor Rivers . The Pharos Institute doesn 't get enough media interest . Most people write off our researchers as cranks , but we are in good company . Galileo and Copernicus were both dismissed by their blinkered scientific contemporaries . - This way . - Of course , Galileo and Copernicus weren 't carrying out experiments in the paranormal . Sir Isaac Newton and Thomas Edison both had strong interests in the paranormal . It 's your work into telekinesis that I 'm interested in . Then you 're in for a treat . - It 's incredible ! - Oh , we 're not done yet . This is impossible . You can 't possibly have ... Unfortunately , we 're having a little difficulty with our energy focus stabilisation . MITRE , Magnified Intensification of Telekinetic Reactive Energies . Those headsets take the latent raw psychic ability all humans possess to move objects with the power of thought and directs it . - Amazing ! Who developed it ? - Our child genius . Sarah Jane Smith , this is Nathan Goss . - Hello , Nathan . I 'm pleased to meet you . - I 'm working ! Sorry to disturb you . It looks very complex . Don 't waste your time or mine asking me to explain . Miss Smith wants to talk to you about MITRE . You told her about MITRE ? How stupid can you get ? I 'm sorry , Nathan , but your work is important . It needs recognition . And we need the funding . Get out ! And leave the thinking to somebody with the intelligence of doing something with it ! Ms Smith , I think we 'd better just ... Come on . I used to know someone your age who could wipe the floor with your intelligence . And wipe the floor with you , too . We 'll see about that . - What do you want ? - My name 's Clyde . I 'm a friend of Luke 's ... - I mean Ashley 's . - So ? - Can I see him ? - No , times two . Now hop it . - You don 't much look like Ashley , do you ? - You trying to say he 's not our Ashley ? That Sarah Jane sent you ? See ? His birthday . Ashley , me and his dad . - We gave him a skateboard . - Good was he , on a skateboard ? Stunning . You take that photo and you show it to Sarah Jane and tell her my boy is back where he belongs ! Clyde ! Clyde ! Up here ! Clyde ! Sir , can I go to the toilet please ? - Clyde ? - Maria ! This Luke and his folks thing stinks . His so-called mum wouldn 't let me see him and you know what she said they gave him ? A skateboard . - He has no sense of balance at all . - After what the Bane did ... You don 't lose something like that . It 's instinct . They gave me this photo . It 's of Luke and them at his party . - That proves everything , doesn 't it ? - Photos can be faked . I 'm going to take it to Sarah Jane . - What are you doing here ? - We have a problem . Nathan Goss is a genius . He has an IQ of 195 . He was reading quantum physics at the age of eight . Some call him the young Einstein . Others say his potential exceeds Einstein . He 's an obnoxious brat , but there 's something else about him . Something that made my blood run cold . Despite his IQ , a telekinetic energiser is still beyond the genius of Nathan Goss . It could make a terrible weapon . A destroyer of worlds , in the right hands , with the right mind . - Where did it come from ? - If I could analyse it , I could be definitive of its origin . Are you asking me to go back and steal one of those headsets ? It would be of great assistance . Sarah Jane has seen the telekinetic energiser ! - They gave her a demo . - She doesn 't know anything . She must know something , you moron , or she wouldn 't have been in the lab . - There 's no need to talk to him like that . - This is my mission . I can talk to him anyway I like . The Xylok said she might come . It said it would take care of her . Do you really think we can trust a Xylok ? The plan 's too far advanced . She can 't stop us . We 've got the boy ! What was that ? These new flesh-suits might handle the gas exchanges better , but they 're a bit on the snug side . You 're Slitheen ? - But you 're skinny ! - Amazing , isn 't it ? With this technology I can eat all I want and still be a size eight . - And you ? - What ? Don 't you remember me , Luke ? How you killed my family and left me locked in a sealed room to die ? Carl ? Same Slitheen , different skin . I teleported out and survived . My father wasn 't so fortunate . And now I 'm going to get my revenge ! Sarah Jane ! Mr Smith , I need you . - Clyde , what a pleasure . - What ? Really ? Oh , cool ! - You have something for me ? - Yeah , as it happens . I 've got this . It 's a picture of Luke with that pair that reckon he 's their kid . I think it 's a fake , see ? - I thought you could do your analysing thing . - You 're right , Clyde . It is fake . I faked it . You ? Am I missing something here ? More than you could ever imagine , Clyde . - What 's going on ? - I am a Xylok . I have a purpose . - And you , Clyde , are a part of it . - Ahhh ! Telekinetic energy fetches a huge price . - Clyde , where are you ? - Mr Smith 's going to kill us and I 'm inside him . I trusted him with my life . We 're taking on these aliens with bottles of vinegar ? I gave him to the Slitheen . I have to get him back . At last , we can begin . - It 's not possible . - Luke isn 't possible . Mr Smith isn 't possible . But together they are bringing the moon crashing down on Earth . Maximum defence mode . Take care , mistress , and you , young master . Safe to proceed , mistress . I have the unit covered . - Do you wish me to continue firing ? - Just be ready if I need you , K9 . - Very good , mistress . - A robot dog called K9 ? Affirmative . - I am dreaming , aren 't I ? What have you done to me , Sarah Jane ? - I feel ... I feel strange . - It 's a computer virus , Mr Smith . It 's closing down your databanks . You 're losing your memory . The speed of light is 36 ... No , 84 ... The Metrabeelen Cosmic Cluster is home to 68,000 life forms , 67 ... I 'm forgetting it all . Sarah Jane , help me . Without your memories , you have no purpose . You can 't destroy the Earth . Put the moon back into its original orbit . And set Luke free now ! - I 've forgotten my purpose . - Your purpose is to save the Earth . That is your new purpose , to save Earth . Save the Earth . Yes , I have a purpose . Thank you , Sarah Jane . The unit is non-functional . He did it . It worked . The moon 's going back . - Is everything satisfactory , mistress ? - Affirmative , K9 . Must return to the distortion , mistress . Without my attention , black hole will turn critical in 0.42 time spatial increments . Go now . Good dog . I 'll see you again soon . - Mum ? - Oh , Luke . I 've seen amazing things out there in space . But strange things can happen wherever you are . - There they go . - Back to Raxacoricofallapatorius . - And good riddance . - Will they be back ? - Oh , I expect so . Sooner or later . - What about Mr Smith ? Can we trust him again ? The Armageddon Code has wiped his circuits . He 'll reboot with a new purpose , to safeguard the world . Mum ! What a beautiful night . Please come and join us . I have learnt that life on Earth can be an adventure , you never know what you might find . In all the universe , I never expected to find a family .

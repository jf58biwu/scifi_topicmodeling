Believe me , if i could turn them off , i would . Don 't worry , We 've done that for you . At least for now . How did you ... My colleague here is able to suppress The abilities in people around him . ( Peter ) I don 't understand . What is this place ? You are in a facility designed to help people Just like you . Peter , we can help you go back to a normal life . 30 years ago , we had to shut down Research on a vaccine which could Disable your powers . But due to recent events , We have reinstated that research . And i 'm very happy to say that we 're very close To finding a cure for you . Forever ?

Who paid ? Uh , that 'd be me . Do i know you ? Call me Bob . Did you happen to see a morning newspaper ? What ? No , why ? Not a mention of what happened last night On Kirby Plaza . Or the untimely death of our friend Mr. Linderman . Who the hell are you ? Someone who wants to help . Linderman made a mess of things And i 'm here to right the ship . So to speak . Okay . You 've done that by paying our bills . No , i meant helping you with your illness . I know you think Jessica is gone . How do you know about that ? But we 've discovered That when these abilities manifest , The way the mind deals with the new reality Sometimes results in a fracture of sorts . A split personality . No , i 'm finished with Jessica . How do you know a new personality won 't emerge ? I can get you all the help you need . The best care in the world . Uh-Huh . What 's the catch ? The catch is you have to leave your family And enter the program . I just went through hell To get my family back together . I 'm not leaving them now . There is medication you can try at home , but ... But what ? It 's not without side effects . And as you just said , You 've been through so much for your family . Do you really wanna risk ... Losing them all again ? So i just take these pills every day ? Yep . It 's a little cocktail They cooked up here in the lab . It controls the abilities . Dampens them . Like that guy who was standing in the corner Of Bob 's office . The Haitian . Yeah . Sorta . So let 's just call them ... " Haitian pills . " Bye , Peter . Ow ! That hurts . You 'll get used to it . And then you 'll start to like it . Hello ? Who said that ? Me . ( D.L. singing ) * He 's a jolly good fellow ... * it 's Micah 's birthday today * All right ! 11 years old . Almost the man of the house now . Mom ? Did you make a wish , baby ? ( D.L. ) Don 't tell us . 'Cause you know it 's not gonna come true . You both already know what i wished for , anyways . Micah , we 've been over this . But i 've got it all figured out . I could make the car radio pick up the police band . We could go to the crime scene and be heroes . Or the police could just take care of it . We could be like the " Fantastic Four . " Minus one . But still . Micah , i wanna be a hero to you . And i finally figured out how to do that . I think i got a job . A good job . Doing what ? Something that 's gonna make you proud of me , I promise . Come on . I promised i 'd take you bowling , right ? Let 's go . Mom , you coming ? Your mom 's had a long day , Micah . Go get your jacket . All i want is to smile at my boy on his birthday , And i can 't even do that . They said it 's just gonna take a little while For the medication to level out . I just don 't know how much longer i can do this . I wanna say things 'll get better . But i know how that sounds . The truth is , they will . You know , it 's been a month . You still haven 't told me your name . Please , i just wanna be left alone . You came to the right place . I have to warn you , though , It does get a bit old . Let me guess . You were living a perfectly ordinary life . Until one day you discovered you could do Incredible things . I bet it was wonderful at first . You thought perhaps you could save the world . And then you realized , tragically , That you were dangerous . I 'll let you talk to me after a decade . Oh , actually , talk to me after three . If they wanna leave me in here forever , That 's fine by me . You 've been through something awful , haven 't you ? I 'm sorry . I 'm Peter . Hello , Peter . It 's nice to meet you . I 'm Adam . I 'm not in the mood today , Elle . Just a little one ? I 'll up your dose . I 'm fine . Just a little one . Oh ! Not that a fistful of pills everyday isn 't fun , but ... It 's been two months now and i still don 't know A thing about you . I was just thinking ... Maybe there 's more to you than the whole Sadistic lightning thing , that 's all . What 's your story ? I liked you better when you just laid there . So you 're not gonna tell me ? What are you , afraid ? No . You just like to be in control . I get it . I figured as much . Sorry i asked . Won 't happen again . I accidentally set my grandmother 's house On fire when i was six . Caused a blackout In four counties in Ohio when i was eight . I spent my ninth birthday in a glass room With an IV of Lithium in my arm . I 've lived in this building for 16 years . Ever since the shrinks diagnosed me As a sociopath with paranoid delusions . But they were just out to get me Because i threatened to kill ' em . I 'm 24 years old , and i 've never gone on a date . Never been on a roller coaster . Never been swimming . And now you know everything there is to know about me . I don 't have the luxury of being more interesting Than that . Later , alligator . ( Adam ) Word to the wise , friend . I would keep my distance from that one . I caved in a desperate moment six years ago , And i 'm still paying the price . Don 't worry . I don 't want anything from her Except the drugs . I 'm sorry , I keep forgetting . You still believe them . What do you mean ? This cure of theirs . They 've been days away from perfecting it Since i got here 30 years ago . Bob 's not trying to fix you , Peter . No . They created this facility to help us . You 're not in a facility , Peter . Look around . You 're in a prison . You don 't believe me ? Why don 't you try getting out ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Are you all right ? He said it was all a lie . What happened to him , and ... To Peter , and the car crash . I take it he told you he thought he could fly . And the plot to blow up New York . That Peter was a bomb . It must be the pain medication . You deserve to know this . I tried to keep it from you and the boys . What ? There 's a dark secret in the Petrelli family . It started with their father . Delusions of grandeur , Paranoia . It lead to his suicide . But sadly ... That disease has obviously been passed down . My god . Now ... Nathan 's a great man . And his life is gonna be very complicated . He really deserves his dignity and his ... His privacy . So i hope you understand That this has to be kept secret . Can i count on you for that , Heidi ? Hi , what can i do to get you inside a- - Hi ... hi . What can i do to get you Into a brand new car ? Hi , what can i do ... Depends on what you 're gonna do to me Once you get me inside . I got a great feeling about your first day . My butterflies have butterflies . Nik , i am so proud of you . I knew that medication would work out . You were right . I 'm gonna take Micah to school . Okay . You have a great day at work . And when i get home tonight , We 're gonna celebrate . ( Gina ) He 's gonna know you 're not taking the stupid pills . Go away , Jessica . I don 't need you anymore . What makes you think this is Jessica ? Remember me ? That summer that you ran away to l.A. And told everyone to call you Gina ? You 're not real . Oh , you 're gonna sell cars ? I 'm going back to L.A. To go play . No , i 'm in control . If i can handle Jessica , i can handle you . Then why aren 't you taking your meds ? [ Niki banging on glass ] No ! No ! No ! No ! Look , i need to see my family . Just for a day or two . Yes , I-I think that would be absolutely possible . Just not right now . Why not ? They don 't even know i 'm alive . Look , i could let you go , and you could explode again . You could blow up half the East Coast . Okay , so dose me with some drugs And i 'll be back before they wear off . It 's perfectly safe . I 'm sorry , Peter . You 're just not ready for that yet . Okay , so send someone out with me . Elle , maybe . Uh , no . No , no , i 'm sorry , Peter . Um , that 's just not gonna happen . I 'm never getting out of here , am I ? Suddenly the room starts to feel like a cage . I don 't understand . If they 're not gonna help us , why are we here ? To keep us from being out there . Why , because we 're dangerous ? No , Peter , it 's because we could save the world . Years ago , i tried to take my abilities public . I thought that if everyone knew That my blood had curing powers , I could help . How naive i was . That 's why they put you in here . Well , if it were possible to kill me , They would have , I assure you . Instead , i 'm locked up in here . When i could be curing your brother . Nathan . How ? Just a small amount of my blood Could help to heal him . End his pain . Even after everything you 've put him through . So how do we get out ? My daughter is still in there ! Please ! Please ! Hawkins ! Hawkins , get out of there ! Please ! [ Crying ] Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Thank you ! ( Man ) Yeah , good one , D.L. Good job !

You 're not gonna give me a little jolt ? Why , you want one ? Like you said , i 'm starting to like ' em . Starting to like you . Fine , since you asked nicely . Enough fun for one day ? Day number five without the meds . ( Adam ) Then i think it 's time to try . Come on , Peter . You can do it . It 's nice to finally meet you . You know , for 400 years , You 've held up pretty well . Come on , let 's go heal your brother . Excuse me , chief . I 'm looking for this girl . Uh ... She 's over there . Thanks . Jessica ! Guess again . Dude , the chick doesn 't know you . She 's my wife . This is us . Stay out of this . Come on , man . Where am i ? Let 's go . Where am I ? We 're going home . How did you find me ?

Why would you ask him that ? Don 't be so silly . You 're gonna be all right , aren 't you , sugar ? I don 't know . I think I need to get some help . Anything you want , you just gotta ask . You know that , don 't you ? Thank you . I 've taken care of everything . Plane tickets , money . Now this . I 'm so sorry , Nathan . How long until it starts working ? We don 't have time to find out . They 're going to assume that you 'll come To see your brother . This is the first place they 'll look . Come on . Adam , look , look , look ! ( Adam ) Good . Come on . Come on . ( Peter ) That was incredible . His skin was starting to heal right there in front of us . He 'll be as good as new by the time he wakes up . Here , passport . Plane ticket .

Go after him ! You take me back there , I 'm just gonna keep escaping . I 'm not taking you back . You deserve a better fate . Your mother helped me when i was in need . So now you 're helping me ? You must start a new life , Peter . I fear this is the only solution . Your secret is safe with me . Go with god , my friend . ( Mohinder ) There are many ways to define Our fragile existence . Many ways to give it meaning . But it is our memories that shape its purpose And give it context . The private assortment of images , fears , Loves , regrets . Thank you . Yeah . ( Mohinder ) For it is the cruel irony of life That we are destined to hold the dark with the light , The good with the evil . Success with disappointment . This is what separates us , What makes us human . And in the end , we must fight to hold on to . I remember . I remember everything . Good , then . Shall we save the world ?

You Couldn 't Keep Angela Petrelli Safe . She Almost Killed Herself On Your Watch . No , We Stop Maury Here Now . You Realize That Makes You The Bait . We All Have Our Roles To Play . That 's What Linderman Used To Say . My Mother Too . It 's Always These Half-Truths . No Straight Answers . Constant Manipulation . I 'm Trying To Help Everyone Here . How , Bob ? What The Hell Did You People Do ? Why Is Maury Coming Here To Kill You ? Now Is Not The Time To Recount The Past . But To Focus On The Task At Hand . All Right ! Fine , So We Stay Here . How Do We Stop My Father ? Dr. Suresh , I Need You And Niki To Inject Maury With The Virus . Virus ? What Virus ? The Virus Takes Away Abilities . It 's Also Potentially Lethal . You Said We 'd Never Use It Again . Circumstances Have Changed . I Will Not Knowingly Spread This Virus . Maury Is A Killer . He Knows Your Thoughts , Your Nightmares , And He Could Turn Your World Inside Out . We Take Away His Abilities , And Then You Can Cure Him With The Antibodies In Your Blood . No One Dies Here Today . He 's Not Gonna Exactly Volunteer For A Shot . I Can Be Persuasive . I Appreciate The Thought . But This One Goes To You , Matt . What ? Me ? - All I Can Do Is Read Minds . - No , No , No , No . You Have The Same Abilities As Maury Has . Anything The Brain Controls , You Control . No . Senses , Actions , Thoughts - No ! No , I Can 't . I - I - I Can 't Do Any Of That Stuff . Well , Then You Better Learn Fast Because You 're The Only One Who Could Stop Your Father . Hiro ! Hiro ! Caitlin ! Ca-Caitlin ! Caitlin !

On March 20th , 2007 The First Case Was Reported . After That The Shanti Virus Spread Across The Globe . A Pandemic . It 's Killed 93 % Of The World 's Population To Date . The Rest Of Us Live In Quarantine Praying To Find A Cure . This Can 't Be Happening . I Wish It Wasn 't . All These People Died From The Virus ? Yeah , It 's Been A Tough Week . I 'm Supposed To Be Out Hunting Down Maury , But I Needed To See You . I Never Should Have Asked You To Use Your ... Ability To Find My Dad . You Were Just Tryin' To Make Me Happy . I Know That Feeling . When My Dad Left I ... I Blamed Myself . I Thought That I Was ... Too Slow ... Too ... Fat . Too Stupid . I Thought That If I Was ... Better , Or If I Was Smarter , He Would 've Stayed . And Now They Want Me - They Think That I Can Stop Him , That I 've Got This Power . And I Don 't . I Don 't . I Need You To Hear . I Need You To Know That I Love You . Did You Just Hear Me ? Molly ? I Love You , Molly . What 's Left Of The Virus Is In The Lab . Each Syringe Contains Only One Dose , So Use It Wisely . You Don 't Trust Bob , Do You ? Did He Put You Up To This ? I Put Me Up To This . I Wanna Hear Your Side . Bob Is Morally Gray At Best . And The Virus ? He 's Toying With A Death Sentence . You Have The Cure . No One Dies . Just Because He 's A Safety Net Doesn 't Make It Ethical . So You Would Make A Different Choice ? Morally Un-Gray ? I Killed A Lot Of People ...

That We Could Make The World A Better Place For Our Children ... For You . " Snow Falls On Miami . " I Don 't Get It . That Headline Could Have Read " Tsunami Wipes Out Eastern Seaboard . " What Does Any Of This Have To Do With The Murders ? Adam Is The One Who 's Trying To Kill Us . I Thought Maury Parkman Was - Maury 's The Weapon . He 's The Blunt Instrument . Adam Was The Visionary . But With These Abilities , Sometimes People Tend To Think Of Themselves As Gods . Did You Ever Think That , Nathan ? Adam Did . And He Began To Talk About Holocausts , Plagues . Punishing Humanity In Order To Save The World . Sounds A Lot Like Linderman . Linderman Was Adam 's Disciple . Adam Was Dangerous .

Presidential order , Major . I got a message for your classified space buddies ! You guys made a mess of Shanghai . All right , so this is where we communicate with the JCS and this area serves as the Autobots ' hangar . SOLDIER : Secure link to JCS is up , Major . [ CHATTER ON SATELLITE ] [ INDISTINCT TRANSMISSION VOICES ] SOLDIER ON RADIO : Secure line to the Pentagon is now open . - LENNOX : General ? - Will , I saw the Shanghai op . - We had a rough day out there . - Yes , sir . We have intel that I believe warrants an immediate debrief . Now with your permission , I can 't let you see him , but I would like you to hear from the leader of the Autobots . MORSHOWER : Proceed . EPPS : You gotta wonder , if God made us in his image , who made him ? General , our alliance has countermanded six Decepticon incursions this year , each on a different continent . They 're clearly searching around the world for something , but last night 's encounter came with a warning . DECEPTICON ON RECORDING : " The Fallen shall rise again . " " The Fallen . " Meaning what ? OPTIMUS : Origin unknown . The only recorded history of our race was contained within the AllSpark and lost with its destruction . Excuse me ! With this so-called AllSpark now destroyed , why hasn 't the enemy left the planet like you thought they would ? Director Galloway , our National Security Advisor . The President just appointed him liaison . Well , I guess I didn 't get that memo . - GALLOWAY : Forgive the interruption , General . - Excuse me . Coming through . Excuse me . Excuse me , soldier . After all the damage in Shanghai , the President is hard-pressed to say the job 's getting done . Now , under the classified Alien / Autobot Cooperation Act , you agreed to share your intel with us , but not your advancements in weaponry . We 've witnessed your human capacity for war . It would absolutely bring more harm than good . But who are you to judge what 's best for us ? With all due respect , we 've been fighting side by side in the field for two years . We 've shed blood , sweat and precious metal together . Soldier , you 're paid to shoot , not talk . Don 't tempt me . And the newest members of your team . - Easy . - I understand they arrived here after you sent a message into space , an open invitation to come to Earth , vetted by no one at the White House . Let me stop you right there , Mr. Galloway . It was vetted right here . And in my experience , the judgment of both Major Lennox and his team has always been above reproach . Well , be that as it may , General , it is the position of the President that when our national security is at stake , no one is above reproach . Now , what do we know so far ? We know that the enemy leader , classified NBE One , aka Megatron , is rusting in peace at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyssal , surrounded by SOSUS detection nets and a full-time submarine surveillance . We also know that the only remaining piece of your alien AllSpark is locked in an electromagnetic vault here on one of the most secure naval bases in the world . SOUNDWAVE : Decepticons , we have located the shard . And since no one can seem to tell me what the enemy is now after , well , there 's only one clear conclusion ! You ! The Autobots ! They 're here to hunt you ! What 's there to hunt for on Earth besides that ? " The Fallen shall rise again " ? It sounds to me like something 's coming . So , let me ask , if we ultimately conclude that our national security is best served by denying you further asylum on our planet , will you leave peacefully ? Freedom is your right . If you make that request , we will honor it . But before your President decides , please ask him this . What if we leave and you 're wrong ? That 's a good question . [ BELL RINGING ] Oh , my gosh !

Look , hold on , I need your help . Really ? You need my help ? I need ... Look , I am slowly losing my mind . Okay , I had a little crab-bot , plunged a device deep into the soft tissues of my brain and started projecting little alien symbols like a freaking home movie !

Hey , still radioactive . Hands off . Okay , Cube-brain . Any of these look like the symbols you saw ? Where 'd you get these ? Before I got fired , I poached S-7 's crown jewel , over 75 years of alien research , which points to one inescapable fact . The Transformers , they 've been here a long , long time . How do I know ? Archeologists found these unexplained markings in ancient ruins all over the world . China . Egypt . Greece . Shot in 1932 . These the symbols you 're seeing in your head ? - Yeah . - Same ones over here , right ? So , tell me , how did they end up all drawing the same things ? Aliens . And I think some of them stayed . Check this out . Project Black Knife . Robots in disguise , hiding here all along . We detected radioactive signatures all across the country . I pleaded on my knees with S-7 to investigate it , but they said the readings were infinitesimal , that I was obsessed . Me . Can you imagine that ? Yeah . Megatron said that there was another Energon source here . - On Earth . Another source ? - On Earth . Okay ? And that these symbols , maps in my head , would lead him there . You talk to your Autobot friends about this ? No , no , no , the source is before them . Whatever the Energon source is , it predates them . It 's before them . - So , it comes before them . - Correct . Well , then we 're porked , unless we can talk to a Decepticon . I mean , I 'm not on speaking terms with them . Actually , I am . WHEELIE : Let me out ! - This is going to be a little bit sad . - Open it . I will have so many Decepticons on your butt ! Hey , behave ! - What is it , a Decepticon ? - Yeah . - And you 're training him ? - I 'm trying to . I spent my whole adult life combing the planet for aliens , and you 're carrying around one in your purse like a little Chihuahua . Do you want a throwdown , you pubic ' fro-head ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry about your eye , you know , but , if you 're a good boy , then I 'm not gonna torch your other eye . Okay ? I 'm not gonna torch it . Just tell me what these symbols are , please .

Oldest of the old . They 've been here thousands of years , looking for something . I don 't know what . Nobody tells me nothing , but they 'll translate those symbols for you . - And I know where to find them . - Show us . Yeah . SIMMONS : The closest one 's in Washington . Smithsonian Air and Space Museum . Land of dreams in there . All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut . - Hold those . - What is that ? What ? I wear them when I 'm in a funk .

What planet am I on ? - Earth . - Earth ? Terrible name for a planet . Might as well call it " Dirt . " Planet " Dirt . " Tell me , is that robot civil war still going on ? - Who 's winning ? - The Decepticons . - Well , I changed sides to the Autobots . - What do you mean , " changed sides " ? JETFIRE : It 's a choice . It 's an intensely personal decision . So much negativity . Who wants to live a life filled with hate ? You mean you don 't have to work for those miserable , freaking Decepticons ? If Decepticons had their way , they 'd destroy the whole universe . I 'm changing sides . I 'm changing sides , too , warrior goddess . - Who 's your little Autobot ? - You 're cute . Name 's Wheelie . Yeah ! Yeah ! Say my name , say my name .

Can you stop ? - Hey , what are you doing ? - It 's just something to think about . I won 't argue with ... What were you saying ? I told you my name was Jetfire , so stop judging me . Somebody shit the bed this morning . - WHEELIE : Look at this guy . - JETFIRE : I have issues of my own . And it started with my mother ! My ancestors have been here for centuries . My father , he was a wheel , the first wheel . - Do you know what he transformed into ? - No . Nothing ! But he did so with honor , dignity , damn it ! Bollocks . [ MUTTERING ] My boosters are fried . I think we can help each other . You know things I don 't know . I know things you don 't know , I do . I don 't think he knows anything . Honestly , I don 't . I could do this all day . It comes in waves , these vivid symbols . They 're symbols , but they 're in my mind . You see , all this is in my mind and Megatron wants what 's in my mind . - Him and someone called The Fallen . - The Fallen ? I know him . He left me here to rust . The original Decepticon . He 's terrible to work for . It 's always apocalypse , chaos , crisis . These transcriptions , they were part of my mission , The Fallen 's search . I remember now , for the Dagger 's Tip , and the key . Slow down . The Dagger 's Tip ? The key ? What are you talking about ? No time to explain . Hold on , everybody ! Stay still or you 'll die ! [ WIND HOWLING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ GROANING ] [ SIMMONS SHOUTING ] Well , that wasn 't so bad . I just hope we 're still on the right planet . WHEELIE : Hey , that freaking hurt ! Oh , my God . Oh , God . Oh , my God , what a beautiful face . This would be a perfect moment , except you landed on my testicles . Please , get off . [ GRUNTS ] God , my balls . MIKAELA : Sam ! - Where are we ? Simmons ! - Hey ! Yeah ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God . What is this ? It 's Vegas . - SAM : You guys okay ? - MIKAELA : Yeah . LEO : Hey , I think we 're in Vegas ! That really , really hurt . You 're just lucky that I didn 't get hurt ! People could have gotten killed , okay ? And if I would have gotten hurt , - you would have heard ... - Oh , shut up . I told you I was opening a space bridge . It 's the fastest way to travel to Egypt . What ... When did you ... When did you tell us ? You didn 't tell us anything . You didn 't tell us anything . Why are we in Egypt ? Don 't you get snippy with me , fleshling ! You were duly informed ! Can you just stop for a second ? Can you focus ? Can you tell us why we 're in Egypt so we can all have a little bit of semblance of peace of mind ? JETFIRE : This planet was visited by our race once before , by our earliest ancestors , millennia ago . They were on an exploratory mission to harvest Energon , the lifeblood of our race . Without it , we 'll all perish , oxidize and rust , like my wretched self ! Do you have any idea what it 's like to slowly fall apart and die ? Let 's not get episodic , okay , old-timer ? Beginning , middle , end . Facts . Details . Condense . Plot . Tell it . Somewhere buried in this desert , our ancestors built a great machine . It harvests Energon by destroying suns . - Destroy suns ? - You mean blow them up ? Yes . You see , in the beginning , there were seven Primes , our original leaders . And they set out into the universe , seeking distant suns to harvest . The Primes set out with one rule , never destroy a planet with life , until one of them tried to defy this rule . And his name forevermore was The Fallen . He despised the human race and he wanted to kill you all by turning on that machine . The only way to activate it is with a legendary key called the Matrix of Leadership . A great battle took place over possession of the Matrix . The Fallen was stronger than his brothers , so they had no choice but to steal and hide it from him . In the ultimate sacrifice , they gave their lives to seal the Matrix away in a tomb made of their very own bodies , a tomb we cannot find . Somewhere , buried in this desert , that deadly machine remains . The Fallen knows where it is and if he finds the tomb of the Primes , your world will be no more . Okay , so how do we stop him ? Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen . Optimus Prime ? So , you 've met a Prime ? Why , you must have met a great descendant . Is he alive , here on this planet ? He sacrificed himself to save me . So , he 's dead . Without a Prime , it 's impossible . No one else could stop The Fallen . So , the same energy that 's gonna be used to reactivate the machine , could that energy somehow be used to reactivate Optimus and bring him back to life ? It was never designed for that purpose , but it 's an energy like no other . So , then how do you get us to the Matrix before the Decepticons get to me ? Follow your mind , your map , your symbols . What you carved in the sand , it 's your clue . When dawn alights the Dagger 's Tip , Three Kings will reveal the doorway ! Find the doorway ! Go now ! Go ! That was my mission . It 's your mission now . Go before the Decepticons find me and find you . Okay , here 's what my CIA contact says . Ancient Sumerians used to call the Gulf of Aqaba the " Dagger 's Tip . " - That 's the Dagger 's Tip . - It 's part of the Red Sea . It divides Egypt and Jordan like the tip of a blade . 29.5 degrees north , 35 east . Here it is . First thing we 've got to do is get Optimus to the Dagger 's Tip . How are you gonna get him halfway around the world ? I 'm gonna make a call . We got cops ! I can 't go to prison , guys . SIMMONS : Sam , we got to get off this road and lay low . Man , stupid cops ! This is what 's called blending in like a ninja . - Shut up or I 'll blend my fist in your face . - They 're gone . Okay , we 're running out of time . I gotta make the call to Lennox ... You 're on the Worldwide Wanted List . Try calling one base , they 'll track you here in seconds . - CIA is all over this place ! - You 're gonna call . - Okay . That 's a good idea . - All right . I mean , I just had my mind on other things , like winding up in an Egyptian prison . MAN ON PA : NEST departure , 2100 hours . So , we 're shipping him back to base . This is such a mistake . SOLDIER : Major Lennox , phone call . Lennox , I 'm with the kid . The kid . You know , the one with the attitude , right ? We need the truck . The truck . We got a possible resurrection going on over here . You 're not gonna believe where we are . Code Tut , as in King Tutankhamen . Back of a $ 1 bill . Coordinates for airdrop , 29.5 north , 34.88 east . Write it down . Write it . Oh , my God . I got to go . Okay . Heat comes . Wait , who are you ? Wait . It 's me . Leo . Me . Leo . Leo . Leo . Cops are coming right now . We need to go ! Move , move , move , move . Coordinates , 29.5 north , 34.88 east . Tip of the Red Sea . Gulf of Aqaba . Egypt ? Are you serious ? Sir . Even if we could figure out a way to get big man over there , how is this little kid supposed to bring him back to life ? Look , I don 't know , but we got to trust him . SAM : Okay , let 's go over it again . BOTH : When the dawn alights the Dagger 's Tip , - the Three Kings ... - Will reveal the doorway . That 's what he said . You know what it means ? - No , what does it mean ? - I have no idea . LEO : Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Checkpoint . Checkpoint . I don 't have my passport . GUARD : Passport ! [ SPEAKING ARABIC ] They got cameras at the top . [ SPEAKING ARABIC ] All right , chill . This is espionage time . I can handle it . These are my people . I 'm one-thirty-sixth Arab . WHEELIE : Great , a fricking Munchkin . Little people are mean . Tell him he 's tall . [ BOTH SPEAKING ARABIC ] The Dagger 's Tip ? Right ? Egypt , Jordan . We want to go there . Me and my family . This is my family . This is my son , my other son , my daughter . We 're tourists , from New York . - New York ? - Yes . Yes . Fifty kilometers . You look like the guy that runs my falafel stand . Thank you very much . - I know . I know you from somewhere . - Go , Yankees ! Put it on the wire to the CIA . SOUNDWAVE : Decepticons , boy 's location detected . [ SHUSHING ] SKIDS : Undercover , yo . You got to blend in with your surroundings . You know , you got to be part of the landscape . [ GROANS ] Awesome ! I think aliens built that . Yeah , yeah . Come on . Move it ! Move it ! Guard us . Low profile . Don 't make a scene , okay ? WHEELIE : Yeah , some of us got work to do ! Dumb Autobots . SAM : Being my girlfriend is hazardous to your health . Yeah , well , girls like dangerous boys . - Do they ? - Yeah . [ GIGGLES ] You might as well just say it . Ladies first . Okay , so tonight you 're going to be a gentleman . - You 're really chivalrous . - Why are you mad at me ? You know what ? Baby , I 'm not ... I 'm not mad . Do you realize that I just flew 3,000 miles to keep you from getting killed ? I know . Who else could be your girlfriend , Sam ? Look at the things I go through with you . And now we 're underneath the moon and the stars and the three most beautiful pyramids on the planet and you still can 't even tell me that you love me . Pyramids . What ? Why do boys always - change the subject ? - Pyramids and stars . - Sam ? - Come with me really quick . [ BOTH SNORING ] Simmons ! Leo ! Wake up ! Listen , astronomy class , page 47 . Remember the class ? No . No I was only in college for two days . Remember that ? - Here . Get up . Up , up . - What is he talking about ? [ ARABIC PRAYERS ] Okay , you see those three stars ? You see how the last one touches the horizon ? That 's Orion 's belt , but it 's also called the Three Kings . And the reason for that is the three Egyptian kings who built the pyramids of Giza built them to mirror those stars , so it 's like an arrow staring us straight in the face . They all point due east , towards Jordan . The mountains of Petra . PILOT ON PA : We 've had an engine malfunction . We 're gonna have to divert to SOCCENT . Flight master , let 's lighten the load and prepare for bailout . Bailout ? Bailout ? Bailout ? Bailout ? - All right , team , grab your chutes ! - Bailout like bailout ? - You familiar with the standard MC-4 ? - Of course not ! I 've never jumped out of a perfectly good airplane before ! Wait a minute , is this really happening ? - Yeah . - All right , here we go . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . You 're behind this , aren 't you ? What are you talking about ? You heard the pilot . These guys don 't mess around . This is just standard procedure . I 'm just following orders to the letter . Isn 't that what you said ? You just signed a death warrant on your career , Major . Whoa ... Whoa ... Whao ! What was that ? What was that ? That 's not good . Come on . - Right this way ! - I ... I can 't jump out of an airplane ! - I have an ulcer ! No , no . - Come on . It 's okay . I really can 't do this . What are you doing ... Come here ! Come here . - Why aren 't you wearing your chute ? - Because I have to secure the VIPs first . Okay , I want you to listen very carefully and memorize everything that I say . Each chute has a GPS tracker so you can be found by Search and Rescue . Right next to that 's a fabric webbing called a bridle , which holds the pin that keeps the main container closed . - Okay , are you listening ? - I can 't hear what ... - Stop that ! - All right . All right . All right . All right , when the pilot chute inflates into the air , it pulls the pin and opens the main . Red 's your backup , blue 's your primary . I want you to pull the blue . I need you to pull it really hard ! Not now , we 're on the plane , you dumb-ass ! - He say good-bye ? - No , he didn 't even say good-bye . General , we 're loaded and ready . You give us the go , and we 'll be ready to press in five minutes . - Excellent . - Sir , you need to see this now . - Have we checked these coordinates ? - Egypt , sir . - They 're airdropping in . - You 've got to be kidding me . He knows something . We need to be ready to back him up if this thing goes hot . Copy that . CIA just got a hit on the boy , 100 miles from the location on that little note there . It 's getting hotter . It 's gotta be around here somewhere . SIMMONS : You see the size of this ? - You see this ? - SKIDS : Spectacular . Amazing . Look at that . - SAM : It 's here somewhere , guys . - LEO : Yeah , why ? 'Cause we 're trusting Grandpa Blackbird who doesn 't even know what planet he 's on ? In his defense , this is the biggest doorway I 've ever seen in my entire life . Oh , okay . Well , that 's great . Let me do a quick search , all right ? Nope . Ever cross your mind , guys , that archeologists have been here before ? There 's nothing here . SIMMONS : Real life is heartbreak , despair , kid . Sometimes you get to the end of the rainbow and the leprechauns went and booby-trapped it ! LEO : I 'm listening to you ? You live with your mother ! - It 's not over . - It is over . It 's done . Why are we still listening to you , little punk-ass ? I mean , what you ever done for us except ding my rim ? Killed Megatron . How about that ? Well , he didn 't get the job done , you know what I mean , 'cause he 's back now ... - Are you scared ? - Scared ? Scared of your ugly face ! No , I 'm ugly ? Well , we 're twins , you stupid genius ! Bring it , then ! Get off me ! - I 'll change your face around ! - I 'll get all up in that ass ! Bring it ! SAM : Guys ! - You like the way that feels ? - That didn 't hurt . You like that , don 't you ? - Come on , Bumblebee ! - Bumblebee , listen . Now , that 's rude . SAM : Oh , my God . The symbols . Bee ! Shoot it . [ WIND HOWLING ] - SIMMONS : Check this out . - SAM : Look at it . SIMMONS : Wow ! SAM : These are the bodies Jetfire was talking about . SIMMONS : The tomb of the Primes . Yo ! Yo ! The Matrix . SAM : No . No . SIMMONS : Thousands of years , turned to dust . This isn 't how it 's supposed to end . Hear that ? US Air Force ! C-17s ! - LEO : What 's a C-17 ? - You can 't bring him back , Sam . - There 's nothing left . - Look ! Look around you . We didn 't just go through everything we went through for no reason at all , to just have it end like this . There is a reason that we are here . The voices and the symbols in my head led us here for a purpose . Everyone 's after me because of what I know , and what I know is that this is going to work . - How do you know it 's gonna work ? - Because I believe it . You best let me out of this plane . Dropping the big boy . Sam ! You think you can bring him back to life with that pixie dust ? Absolutely . Let 's go . Go ! Let 's move it . Remember , they 're friendlies . [ GOATS BLEATING ] [ SPEAKING ARABIC ] Cover Optimus ! Secure the village . Get those cases down here . I need snipers and Stingers up high . So , we just dropped off 10 tons of dead robot in the middle of nowhere . I hope this little kid know what he 's doing . Yeah , me too . Got a visual ! Yellow team ! Four clicks ! Pop flare ! - That 's them , right there . See the flare ? - Right over there ! See it ? Oh ! Sam ! Oh , God . Please , God ! Please . Leo , stop freaking out . Stop freaking out . Shut this guy up , huh ? - Please , just let me live , just let me live ! - MIKAELA : Shut up and let him drive ! - Just stop screaming ... - All right , that 's it ! [ SCREAMING ] I can 't take that guy anymore . SIMMONS : Hide in the dust ! Use the dust ! We 've got to split up . Bumblebee , you 're the decoy . You lead the Decepticons away , all right ? I 'm gonna get Optimus . I 'll help draw their fire with Huey and Dewey there . You get to those soldiers . - I hope that dust works , kid . - Thank you . LEO : He 's turning around . He 's coming back . He 's coming back . It 's up to me . One man , alone , betrayed by the country he loves , now its last hope in their final hour of need . Prepare to be driven like never before , by the maestro . - Hey , hey ! Don 't go nowhere ! Drive . - You 'll never make it , kid . - I 'm coming with you . - Bravery will only get you so far . You tased me , okay ? You owe me ! I 'm going . Okay , okay . That was a test . You passed . All right ? That thing 's got alien tattoos all over it . That ain 't Air Force . [ ELECTRONIC WHIZZING ] - What the hell was that ? - Anyone copy ? - Anyone there ? Who 's up ? - Copy ? - SOLDIER : Radio 's down . - It 's dead . Comms are down . EMP burst . I see how this day is going in this godforsaken desert . [ PHONE RINGING ] Yes , sir ? - GALLOWAY : Major Lennox told me to pull the cord . - I know , sir . Well , what country am I in right now ? United States . No , not the United States . I 'm from the United States . I 'm in the middle of nowhere surrounded by donkeys . Well , that was our good friend , Galloway . He 's less than pleased . How is it that we can 't reach our men , but he can reach me from some random Egyptian desert ? Nothing . Right , go burn an SOS . Let the eye in the sky know we need some help . - Yes , sir . - Okay , boys , old school time ! LENNOX : Pop some more flares so the kid can find us . [ BOTH PANTING ] Look . There it is . We got a couple of miles . Lennox 's team has the latest in quantum crypto gear . Can somebody tell me why we can 't establish simple radio contact ? We 're hailing them on every frequency and mode in the book , sir . Our satellites in the area have gone blind . We 're working it , sir . Damn it . Something 's not right . It doesn 't add up . Contact the Jordanians , see what air assets they 've got in the area , and get Egypt 's General Salam . Ask him to clear some USV overflights in Egyptian airspace . We need an assist in confirming visuals now . SOLDIER 1 : Scramble Predators now . SOLDIER 2 : V-1 , rotate . SAM : We still have a mile that way . Come on . This way . This way . - One man , alone ... - Stop saying that ! ... betrayed by the country he loves ! Oh , my goodness . I 'm in the car , okay ? You 're not alone . SIMMONS : Just relax . You 're with the maestro . I don 't think he 's still following us . That 's what you think . Uh-oh . Master , sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but the soldiers brought the body of Prime . The boy must have the Matrix . We cannot let him reach Optimus . Decepticons , begin our assault ! SOLDIER : We 've got incoming ! [ THUDDING EXPLOSIONS ] LENNOX : We got a whole lot of fight coming our way . - How many ? - About 13 of them . This ain 't good . This ain 't good . [ SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ] We 're about to get our asses whupped . SOLDIER : Bravo-Charlie , kneel ! All right , those Decepticons are searching for Sam . Whatever he has , he thinks it 'll bring Optimus back to life , so our mission is to find him and get him to Optimus . All right , we 're gonna draw fire from the left flank . I need a scout team . IRONHIDE : I 'm leading . Go up through the middle with Arcee and Ironhide ! All right , when you see the precious cargo , I want you to pop green smoke and come back through those pillars . We 'll have the ambush set . All right . Let 's go . Move out ! SOLDIER : Hoo-ah ! You ever see that film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral ? - With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas ? - No , why ? - Looks like we 're right in the middle of it . - Is that good ? A lot of people died . Oh ! Hide ! - VÃ ¡ monos , amigos ! - Oh , my God ! - Hit the deck ! - Oh , my God ! [ ROARING ] [ WHISPERING ] Sam , Sam . I don 't think they saw us . Get down . Get down . Get down . Okay . Listen . Once it 's clear , we run for Optimus as fast as we can , okay ? What if it doesn 't work ? It 's gonna work . - What if it doesn 't ? - It 's gonna work . It 'll work . [ THUDDING ] [ GIANT FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] [ SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ] [ BUZZING ] [ ELECTRONIC WHIZZING ] [ BOTH SCREAMING ] Up , up , up ! Get ready to jump ! SAM : We got a half-mile . I don 't think the soldiers know we 're here . Fall back ! - Ironhide , up the middle ! - Ironhide , move it ! Let 's go ! Go , go ! MEGATRON : Devastator ! We 're trapped ! There 's nowhere to go . We 're gonna die . If we 're going out , we 're going out like men , understand ? [ SPEAKING ARABIC ] [ LEO SCREAMING ] - Oh . - Look at this mother ... Mean robots suck ! Hang on ! Hang on , okay ? - Simmons ! - Don 't let go ! Hang in there , I got you ! Just hang in . I don 't want to die ! Kung fu grip , boy . Kung fu grip ! You ain 't getting me ! He dead . He got so ate . - Who 's your daddy now , huh ? - He got all ate up . The only safe place is right under it . - Run at it . Run for its feet ! Move it ! - Yeah . You should 've never eaten me ! I 'm gonna bust your face up ! Oh , my God ! Nobody mess with me ! In your face ! Keep fighting , Mudflap ! Oh , my God ! Nobody messes with the twins . I got you ... My bad ! Oh man !

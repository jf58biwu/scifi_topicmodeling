 I always add a touch of Nina . - And what about the girl ? - Tucked away , not to worry . - Where are you ? - In Michigan . I found her . I found Nina . I 'm completely aware of people 's emotions even total strangers , without having to think about it . Your Jacobson 's organ is working ? Are you telling me that you 've had this procedure done ? I have a heightened senese of empathy . - Someone had to be the first volunteer . - No , they didn 't . I need you to go back to Roth 's lab with me . What happened here ? The second stage primate trials injected with my stem cells . They did this to themselves . Oh my God . What about me ? - You 're looking for me ? - Yeah . What are you doing tonight ? Feel like catching some dinner ? What 's the bad news ? How do you know I have ... ? Can you smell that I 've got bad news ? No , whenever you have bad news , you want to feed me . You 're just like my mother , David . We got back the neurology report on the dead monkeys in Roth 's lab . They all had high levels of methoxytyramine . The byproduct of dopamine , associated with anxiety and paranoia . Which means they probably did go nuts and rip each other apart . After , you know , taking out that lab tech . Bob , we 've gotta test Nina . And you , what about you ? You could also , I don 't know ... Bob ... Bob , there 's a 93 % genetic similarity between macaques and humans . Those monkeys went crazy 8 weeks after being implanted with your stem cells . Nina went through the same procedure . She 's not a monkey , David . You know what ? Ethically , it 's her decision , so . Since when are you an expert on ethics ? I 'm pretty good when it comes to other people ... Give her a call . She can come have dinner with us . And I 'll talk about it . She went home . To see her dad . She 'll be back on Monday . Mayko ! It 's just you and me then . How about that little Russian place you keep telling me about ? I promise I won 't go home with anybody 's date . Mayko , Bob and I are heading out . Phone 's dead . Come on . Mayko ? I got my bike . You wanna cab it ? Streetcar is more environmental . - I 'll get my stuff . - Where is everyone ? Rachel is checking viral samples for the CDC . Carlos said he 's staying late to catch up on paperwork . New boyfriend 's busy tonight , eh ? Ex . Really ? Already ? Well , if everybody 's working late , how come nobody 's working ? - Doctor Sandström . - Yeah . Mayko needs you both right away . In Bioinformatics . This about the phones ? No , the phones are out up and down the block . I know he 's the new lab tech . What 's his name ? Bilal Hassan . Something 's wrong . - What the fuck 's going on here ? - Your cell phones , please . We come in God 's Name . Follow our instructions , everyone lives . Cell phone . - I lost it . - Shoot her . Found it . ReGenesis 4x09 Unbottled Subtitles Team NorBAC Bbsiocnarf , Dapitch666 Golgi , Linwelin , Michvanilly Version NoTag 1.0 You . You . Have a seat . Sit . Take the tape off . You shaved today , Dr. Sandström ? Fuck ! Take hers off , too . Gently . Bilal , what are you doing with these assholes ? This asshole just did you a favour . Now do me one and listen . Everyone here is a tiny spec in God 's large plan . Now we can all hurt each other or not . - It 's up to us . - If there is a god , I doubt his plan has anything to do with your plan . We need you to do some things , and we will leave , and you will all be unharmed . Do we have your cooperation ? Probably not . What do you want us to do ? Open a secure line in NorBAC 's US military science network . We don 't have that capability . You were trained at Fort Huachuca , Arizona , to use the SCI-COM system . Secret Scientific Communications . - What the fuck are you talking ... - March 3 to March 9 , 2003 . You both have to enter your passwords . Her first , then you , then her again . Please . We 'll do it if you let one hostage go . - Too many bad movies , Dr. Sandström . - Alright , fuck you then . Do you want me to make her a double amputee ? Because I have to be out of here by 6 AM Monday - and you are slowing me down . - You blow off her leg , she 'll be unconscious in ten seconds . Then where will you be ? I suppose you 're right . We 'll cut her ear off . Alright , no wait ! Stop it ! - Stop ! - Your password , Doctor . Mayko , just do whatever they tell you . You 're up , Doc . It 's okay . You both have fail-safe passwords , to alert the system if you 've been forced to access it . Please enter the real ones . Mayko . Press " Send " . Thank you . Now I want Special Biological Sciences at Fort Egan . Do it . " Welcome to the US Army 's Division of Special Biological Sciences . " " Special chemicals . Special poisons . " " Special germs . " Guess you guys aren 't here about global warming , eh ? Oh yes , Doctor . Indirectly . Stage two . Dr. Sandström . Please . Wait a minute . Fuck ! I want you to do a search for Strain 751 . - Strain 751 of what ? - Search . I 'm searching . Okay , wait a minute . Carlos . If you don 't like this , you can shoot me . No , stop , please . You okay ? Oh yeah . We don 't need the tape . They have nothing to say . - Sorry about that . - Thank you . It 's okay . Take it easy , Bob , it 's okay . - Why are my legs shackled ? - You 're a champion kickboxer . I 'm not a champion and you have a gun . This liquid is not dangerous to me or you . I want you to spin out the RNA and re-suspend it in 100 microliters of TE . What is it ? - It is what it is . - Is it viral ? - You have one hour to do it . - Can you at least untie my wrists ? There are dozens of 751 Strains . What 's it a strain of ? Look for Strain 751 Gamma . There are three . Which one ? - I can go home while you decide ? - That one . ED-MV . Now download the normal and the gamma . ED-MV Strain 751 Normal ... Downloading . ED-MV 751 Gamma ... Downloading . A record of these downloads will be posted . Someone will notice them . They 're in the middle of a fire drill . Thank you . What are you doing ? We use the internet for half of what we do here . Now I need you to find the mutations that will allow your colleagues to turn Strain 751 into 751 Gamma . You want me to do a sequence alignment , find the mutations and then what ? Design all the primers ? No . We already have all the primers to most of the mutations . You are to identify and design the last one that we need . Okay ... It 'll take me about 5 or 6 hours . No , it will take you 15 minutes . I have to go to the bathroom . I really have to go . Let him go to the bathroom . I can 't wait . Use a pail . Please . Listen , if you want him to work , cut him some slack , okay ? - What is happening ? - Fundamentalist assholes . Muslims ? Christian , Jewish , what difference ? How many of them are there ? I saw 3 of them . The homework 's done , they mean business . They had us tap us into the SCI-COM . God , David ! We can 't cooperate ! We can 't help them create something that can kill millions of people . Nobody 's gonna die , okay ? I have a plan . Okay , what ? What are we gonna do ? - They 're here because they need us . - Yeah . So , if we figure out what they 're trying to do , maybe we can screw them up . For now , we cooperate ... - We can 't ! - We see where they 're going . No heroics . No refusing to do what they say . You two . Come on . Wait , it 's as cold as Edmonton in here . Can I get a sweater from my locker ? - No . - Just a measly sweater . Doc , you can stay here with me . You two , please go with him . It 's gonna be okay , Bob . You do as they say . Remember you guys , you 're scientists . You let the cops be the heroes . - You 're getting smarter . - Let 's see how smart you are . Wait here . Go to him . You are to make one set of primers then use it along with these other 4 sets to make five mutations using this cloning strategy . Use this reverse transcriptase and PCR kit . I know they are both good so there can be no mistakes . Well , I 'll have to make a DNA vector . - And what will I use for a template ? - Here 's a tube of vector DNA . Start making the primer , prepare the vector for cloning . I 'll take care of the template . You have eight hours to do it . Whatever it is they want , do it . Can I at least get my music ? Get to work . Come with me . Bilal , he 's a fragile man . You have to be patient with him . I need you to get me 8 flasks of Vero cells . Okay , if you 're gonna be screening a toxin from a bacterium like E. Coli then I suggest CCL-81 . But if you 're growing some sort of virus , I 'd make CRL-1587 . Use Vero E6 , it 's the fastest . - Okay . - And use 10 % FBS . - How else would I do it ? - Do it and talk less . Whatever you say , Bilal , whatever you say . Let the police be the heroes . - You 're getting smarter . - Let 's see how smart you are . We gotta talk . Doc , what would you like in it ? I 'll take it black . Listen , what 's your name ? Come on , man , just a first name . Alright , I 'll call you ... Charles . Charles , here 's your problem : what if somebody decides to be a hero ? Any one of these people can throw this off and you 'd never know who . Where is this leading ? Let me help you , alright ? I will make sure that they really do what you say . And then when we 're all finished , you can let them go , and if you need a hostage or , you know , someone to kill , you got me . Doc , I told you we 'd let you all go . Our plan works whether you live or die . Well , that 's reassuring . Do we have a deal ? No . Want some cheese ? Hey , Doc . Let me cut that for you . Can I please listen to my music ? It relaxes me . No . Hurry up ! Move ! I can 't concentrate . I need my music . Get back to your work ! Idiot ! - I 'm sorry , you scared me ! - Shut up ! Move ! { \ - I 'm sorry ... } - Shut up ! - Okay , but I need my music . I was talking about that . Now you need to let me help you if you want to get out of here in time . Is it ruined ? - Yes ... - Hey ! Okay , Doctor . You can supervise your team along with Bilal . Thanks , Chuck . - What were you spinning ... - Quiet ! No talking . Come , I want to see how Bob is doing . I think I 've lost the RNA pellet when I was drying it . Sorry ... Stop ! Stay here . I have another aliquot . Don 't touch anything . You 're running primers , Bob ? How many sets in total ? - Don 't answer . - How am I supposed ... You don 't have to know everything . I got a little nervous because you 're a little nervous . I 'm not nervous . You need anything , Bob ? Dr. Sandström . So what are we doing here ? He 's expecting me to grow Vero cells faster than they can replicate . It is possible with the conditions I 've given you . Less talk , more work . What are we making ? Something viral . But what ? Carlos is working with RNA . Bob 's doing mutations . Wait a sec . What did Mayko say ? Wait , it 's as cold as Edmonton in here . Do you think I can get a sweater ? - No , get in there . - A measly sweater ! " Edmonton " . " Measly " . Edmonston Measles Virus ? Ah , fuck . Oh , they are smart . Measles killed more people than AIDS . Tweak it and the bodies will pile up to the sky . We 're making the measles genome really nasty . Do you how many mutations Bob was making ? Five ! Five . He went like this . Okay ... What will we do ? - I 'd start with growth rate . - I heard about this Japanese scientist who wanted to make the measles vaccine infectious , spread immunity naturally . He got measles to grow 100 times faster with one mutation . - It was well documented . - Alright ... One . Next change will be stealth . Something that would allow the virus to become less detectable by a vaccinated host . What would you tweak ? - Come on . - I would mutate the ... dominant epitopes in the F , H and N proteins . Okay great . Now everybody who is inoculated can get it too , right ? Right . Add something to make measles more deadly . - How much would it take ? - Virulence ? One mutation . That 's what they took from Fort Egan . They can get the rest off the internet . David , we can 't do this . We can 't cooperate . Listen to me . We can kill him with what I have on the shelf . - What about the other two ? - There are five of us , two of them ! - With two machine guns . - We take his weapon . - You ever fired a gun ? - Hundreds of times . We cannot make a highly contagious killer measles . David . Weaponized measles . No , we can 't . Okay , I gotta get alone with Bob . I 'll pull on my ear , you create a fuss . Okay . Bilal ! - Who 's watching them ? ! - I am ! From where ? Out here ? We 're on schedule . We 're all good . - How are you doing here ? - Great . { \ - Good . } Never do that again . Good . Here 's the template . Get going . Cloning this many DNA fragments will take at least a week . No . It 's a new variation on the mutagenesis protocol . You 'll be able to insert multiple point mutations at once . They were on to this in San Diego . Somebody slipped you the protocol ? Something like that . - Sorry , where were we ? - Let 's start here . Bilal ! I have a problem ! Oh , shit . No , hang on a sec . Okay , listen . Five mutations , but I bet you 're only running primers for one set , right ? They already had four set and I 'm synthesizing the fifth . I 've no idea know what happened . - It was the Bunsen burner and I ... - Get her out ! Ow , let me go ! It may be a virulence gene to weaponize Edmonston measles . What do you think ? I dunno . It wasn 't in our viral database . Because they got it from Fort Egan . Jesus . Stop ! Get away from me ! Here 's what I want you to do . The normal genome is on our database . We can figure out which one of the primers has mutation and exclude it . Without it , the polymerase will only replicate the normal gene . Exactly . Do it . Leave me alone ! You get your fucking hands off of me ! One move , then I 'm gonna hurt you . - You let go . - Okay . Carlos ! Stay where you are ! - Go back ! Get the fuck back ! - I 'm a doctor , let me attend to her . Bilal . The fire 's out . It looks like she started it on purpose . Get up ! Get her up ! Take it easy . Take it easy . If you can 't work ... We don 't need you . Do you understand ? - I 'm the virologist . - So ? Get her out of my face . - You 're a virologist , too , Doctor ? - I 'm a molecular biologist . But an expert in the Spanish Flu , no ? - We makin ' the Spanish flu ? - Do her work . Go . Now . Any problem with her , you shoot them both . You understand ? Yeah , you 're right , it 's cold as Edmonton in here . Finished with the PCR ? You 're fast . I work better when I have music . Now start cloning the DNA . How 's Rachel ? Set up the cells . Yes , Sir . - You okay ? - Yeah . We 're weaponizing measles . David , when he comes back , we take his gun . Bob 's out there . They put a gun to his head , we 'll cave . This isn 't caving ? Bob is only synthesizing one set of primers , okay ? We 're right , it 's for virulence . I told him how to mess it up . We 'll be giving them the world 's most contagious measles and no one will die . David , that is a very big " if " . I think I 'm right . If you 're wrong , you 're going to have 3 very pissed off terrorists . - How the fuck will they know ? - What cleared Bilal for security ? He was born and raised in Belgium . US citizen . DHS and RCMP cleared him . That 's ammonium hydroxide in those bottles . When he comes back , throw it in his face , we overpower him ... - I prefer not to anger armed men ! - They 're going to kill us ! - You don 't know that ! - If and when we fight back , we are gonna have one chance , alright ? We do it when ... Recovered ? Never better . Come . I need you to do a viral prep . Here are your instructions . - This how they do it in Pakistan ? - I don 't know , never been there . You know , there 's a problem , I 'll need to talk to Bilal . Start with the transfection . Use Nucleofector 6 in a ratio of 1 to 7 . What happens when this is all over ? - You go home . - Yeah but we 've seen your faces . Won 't matter . Show time . Come on . Get up . You too . You . Wait a minute . If you want to test that , you test it on me , Chuckles . No . - Her . - She 's the best virologist here ! Yes . - What we asked you to make , it 's right ? - We followed your instructions . Then I don 't need her , do I ? - Test it on me . - Come . Test it on me ! - No wait ! - Test it on me ! All of you , move ! You too . All of you , let 's go ! Is this the real thing ? - I don 't know . Is it ? - What we asked you to make ? - Yeah . - Then take it . In a few hours , I 'll know whether or not you were telling the truth . Then I 'll let you go . - If she takes it , she 'll be OK , right ? - Bob ? - I did what David told me to . - Then hopefully it 's harmless . Question is , does Rachel know that ? No , I 'll make the others sick . That 's why I brought you here . You 'll be in quarantine . Now take it . - I 'll be dead . - Take it and you may die tomorrow . Don 't take it , and you will die now . - Shit ! - What ? I think Bilal was sequencing the measles . He 'll find out we didn 't do the last mutation . Fuck ! Listen . I don 't know what the hell you had us make , but I bet I 'd rather die from a gunshot - than from that . - Inhale it . - Shoot me . I 'm not taking it . - Take it ! Fuck you . I 'm not gonna take it . I am going to count to three . - Count . - One ... - I 'm not taking it . - Two ... - Shoot me . - Now ! Three ! I believe you . I believe it 's real . Thank you , you 're free to go . Bullshit . You don 't need me anymore . You don 't need any of us . Turn around . Turn around . God ! Maybe ... Maybe it was ... Maybe it was ... a warning shot . Yeah , maybe ... My God , they 're gonna kill us all . No , they 're ... They 're just testing it . They wouldn 't kill Rachel , right ? They 'd wait at least 12 hours . She 's okay , I 'm sure . I mean , would you kill your guinea pigs ? Right ? Now 's the time , guys . Now 's the time . Shit . They took out the ammonia hydroxide ! What do we do now ? If you 're planning a rebellion , you should know : the building is wired with explosives . Is Rachel okay ? Hurry up ! Up ! I said get up ! I said up ! We gotta go ! Come on ! You got one second . Bob , get the gun ! Get the gun ! Weapon please . Let him have the gun , Bob . Slowly . I have news . Bilal has sequenced the genetic mutations that we asked for . Five out of five . Perfect . Good work , gentlemen . To your health . What the fuck is going on ? They 're using themselves as a delivery system . - But we didn 't do the last mutation . - Maybe Bilal made a mistake . Maybe we did . Gentlemen . We will speak only the language they understand . Death . Then they will stop the invasions . Iraq , Palestine , Lebanon , Afghanistan . And with this unbottled , we will spread justice . And we will be rewarded in Paradise . We 're leaving . Finish them off , get rid of the bodies before sunrise . You have done your work . Now you will be rewarded . - Now they 'll think you 're all dead . - Who the hell are you ? They 're gone . It 's over . What did you say ? I 'm an undercover agent . I need to confirm a reservation . The name is Smith . Smith ! That 's right , Smith . Where 's Rachel ? Is she dead ? Why didn 't you stop them ? We didn 't know who the other 5 in the cell were ! My orders were to wait until they all got here , alright ? Their plan was to fly to London , Moscow , Tel Aviv , New York , Tokyo . In 25 weeks , measles would 've killed more people than AIDS did in 25 years . - Would have if the virus was harmless ? - I saw ! I saw ... that you sabotaged the mutation , but we didn 't know if you would . - You could have stopped this ! - You used us . I had my orders . You 're alive . And millions won 't die . Do not move ! Drop your weapon and move forward ! You OK ? Shit ! Hey , baby . - You okay ? - Yeah . I just had this crazy nightmare . Come back to bed . I gotta get a glass of water . You stay warm . Maybe it 's too soon . Oh , no . Believe me . I am glad that you are here . It 's only been a month . I 'm fine , Rach . You want some water ? No , thanks . I don 't know why I 'm having these nightmares . Guilt . - Because of Wes . - No , no ... Where is Wes anyway ? He never comes to work anymore . Wes is in Sweden . Yeah ... And I died in the lab . You really have to learn to say good-bye , David . I just ... I just need ... some time alone is all . Are you drinking ? Not nearly enough . Enuka Okimba . I don 't mind sleeping with the boss . - Fine by me . - Then I accept your job offer . You can never keep your personal life separate from your professional life , and then you leave the rest of us picking up the pieces . Ms. Tran ? Please , our daughter has a aplastic anemia . Her bone marrow doesn 't work . She 's dying . - Please , just read this report . - We have nowhere else to go . If humans follow the same timeline as the monkeys , in a week , possibly two , Nina may begin to experience the same violent tendencies . Nina , did I wake you ? No ! What 's happening ?

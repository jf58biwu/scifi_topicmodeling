 Previously on Defying Gravity . - Sharon , come in . - Donner ? - Sharon , do you copy ? - Donner ? - Launch now , Donner ! - God forgive me . Launch now . I know Donner and I coming on board last minute is a little awkward . Not for me . Just remember how much I love you . I think the obvious question is simply , what the hell happened ? One minute , we 're on the mission . The next minute , we 're off Something 's happening , and I need to know why . Paula Puke . Queen of the upchuck . Mistress ofheave . It 's talking to her again . My withdrawal symptoms are under control , Doctor . So , what are you doing there ? You working on the rabbit embryos ? - You 're changing the subject . - And Ajay ? Will he be coming back on the floor ? - Goss wants to do a thorough psych eval . - And if he passes ? He won 't pass , Rollie . Ajay once told me that the idea of a man ... knowing everything about something is folly . His word , not mine . He said that man by his very nature is dependent on other men . We need each other to survive . - I 'll get that . - I got it . - I can get it . - I can get it too . The problem is getting anybody to admit that . You must be feeling better . I 'm starving . And I 've got lots of catching up to do . - My space classroom , the lander G.N.C. And - - If you need some help , I - Steven . I can count on this spork more than you . As a species , we pride ourselves on being self-sufficient . No Form 24 today . You guys know what to do ? Why ask a stranger for directions ? We 'd rather stay stubborn and lost . - How many times have you been back ? - Three . - And all I see is a storm . - So how does it make you feel ? - What do you mean ? - I mean , how does it make you feel ? Afraid ? Alone ? What 's your response to it ? I 'm just trying to help you through this . Eve , all I see is a storm . I 'm in a Martian storm . - Good morning , Frenchie . - You look way too good to be in withdrawal . I 'm switching med patches as we speak . I think I 'm through the worst of it . You look awful . - Not getting a whole lot of sleep . - Wanna talk about it ? Know a good shrink . As long as his office isn 't six million kilometers away . Well , then you 're piss out of luck . - How 's Ted ? - Uh , he 's distant . But he 's doing his job . Whatever Rollie said to him did the trick . Maybe you should talk to Rollie . Ajay 's still on med watch , Donner . - Can 't come on the floor until he 's cleared . - You 're on the floor , Rollie . I didn 't need a psych eval . He did . That simple . Strikes me as damn stupid to have me up here ... running systems checks without the engineer who helped design it . - Point taken . - This better not be one of Goss 's games . - No , it 's not , Donner . - Smells like it . - It 's not . - So how come I haven 't heard from Ajay ? He has restricted access until he 's cleared . Roger that . I 'll run the check alone . Didn 't expect to see you so soon . Didn 't expect to be back so soon . I 'll have the chicken curry . All right . Soda water with lime ? No . I think I 'll have a beer . Okay . The nuclear reactor on Antares ... will power four redundant electrical subsystems . Now , on the Mars missions , we were primarily solar , so this is a big improvement . For safety reasons , each of the subsystems ... is discretely located on the ship . Sharma , you have your hand in the air . - Yes . - You need the exercise , or do you have a question ? Your information 's actually out of date . There 's three subsystems now . Budget cuts . - I 'm sorry ? - The change is very recent . My sponsor company designed it . I was on the team . Oh . Well , then we 're very fortunate to have you here , aren 't we ? I don 't know what the hell I 'm doing up here flapping my gums ... when we have the designer in the house . - Donner . - Come on , Sharma . You know everything . Why don 't you get your ass up here and share it with us ? Dude , those are some large , hefty man balls you got swinging down there . Dude . No , man . Donner . - In class , making him look like a chump ? - L - Takes a pair to do that , especially when he 's on the rag . The rag ? What do you mean ? - You don 't know what today is ? - What ? It 's the fifth anniversary of the Mars disaster today , man . Look at him . Donner 's ready to take that bag out . But good on you , man . Grinding his face in his shortcomings . He needed it . I 'm cramping . I gotta go take a steam . Life on the ship is an adjustment for everyone . The close quarters , the distance from Earth ... the responsibility we have to help our fellow crew members . One of the biggest adjustments we make is to the lack of gravity . Just ask your host , Paula Puke . Stop ! Here in our quarters ... we have natural gravity caused by the centrifugal force of our spinning rotors . But in the rest of the ship , we create artificial gravity ... with magnetism and our grav suits . Jorge from La Escuela Gueverra in Santiago , Chile asked ... why our hair doesn 't fly . Un excelente pregunta , Jorge . Let 's find out . What do you have in your hand , Zoe ? This is nano spray . We use it on our hair ... and nonstandard clothing to make it slightly magnetic . - Can you show us how it works ? - Sure . You just , uh , give your hair a couple of good shots . And ... voilà . Porcupine head . Qué linda . You 're so funny . - Okay . Who just turned out the lights ? - It 's either Wass or - - Was that the ship or the camera ? - The ship . Flight , we have a primary subsystem electrical failure . Donner , tell me that 's you running a systems check . Uh , negative , Mike . I 'm trying to get it back up now . Looks like some kind of short or a bus failure . - Can you bypass it ? - Uh , no . That 's not working . I 'm gonna have to take a look . In the meantime , you guys better start looking for Ajay . We 're not wasting time looking for Ajay , people . Start looking for solutions . I hear they put that on the menu just for you . It 's an astronaut bar . They like to keep us happy . I 've had that curry . You can 't be that happy . It 's not exactly like home , is it ? Right . Yes . And now that you have so subtly reminded me ... we used to be subjects of the same crown , you should sit and we should talk ... because , well , we share the bond of flag and curry . Exactly . That was not a sincere offer . No , I 'm aware of that . Can I have - I 'll have what he 's having . Thanks a lot . So , um , do you know what I did before I was assigned here ? I watched you every night on the evening news . Mmm . Yep . A heady time ruined by a single act of hubris . Guess the lesson is that journalists should not make up their stories , hmm ? And , of course , astronauts shouldn 't really go on unauthorized spacewalks . I was fixing the shield . I exposed a crooked politician , Ajay . - It doesn 't matter , Mr. Williams . - That 's my point exactly though , isn 't it ? Here we are , you and I , both exiled from what we should be doing ... seeking some kind of redemption . Maybe we should be helping each other . Oh , thanks . Lovely . Looks just how I remember . Oh , I understand they 're having a bit of a power problem ... on the Antares this morning . It 's a shame they 're not consulting you , really . You know , with your , uh - - Excuse me . - Yeah , of course . - I have to go to the men 's room . - Right . Oh , God . It 's just how I remember it . Say , have you got any mango chutney or anything just to , you know - Ajay ? - Is anyone left in their bay ? - No . - What are you doing ? - I 'm trying to figure out ... why anyone would think that Scott Summers is a better leader than Jean Grey . I mean , the Sentinels alone - I like your hair . You remind me of my mom . - What ? - There 's something wrong . - Yeah , I know . Look at her . - Yeah , we were using a magnet - - Looks good . - We 're going to the flight deck now . Come on . Let 's go . Vámonos . What 's the point ? It 's just a bus failure . Donner 's probably got it under control . Flight , it 's not a bus failure ... and all the Brayton circuits check out nominal . I 'm gonna have a look up in the node . It 's the only place the electrical subsystems meet . - What are you doing ? - You try to find the problem ... and I 'll try to find your sex drive . - It 's been missing since you got here . - Seriously , Nads . Mmm . Don 't you wanna try it weightless ? Hmm ? Ow ! Damn - Do you have to leave a mark always ? Just laying claim to my territory . Your territory 's got some work to do . All right , Flight , we 're going off grav in Aft Sector 4 . See ? You worry too much . So ? - H2I K. - And H2I K is bad ? H2I K could be as bad as it gets . Sector 4 going back on grav . - I think I worry just enough . - Too much . And that 's why nobody likes you . You swim in a sea of self-delusion , Wass . Okay , if I 'm swimming in it , you 're drowning in - What was that ? - I think it 's the rotor arm . - This rotor arm ? - Oh . - Yep . This rotor arm . All right . What we know is that the failure is inconsistent ... bridges all of the subsystems and is somehow related to the mag grav in Aft Sector 4 . The mag grav checks out nominal . So it 's related , but not connected . I 'm gonna need to look at code as well as schematics and run a full systems check . Okay . Go to work , people . They got it covered . And you gotta get to the hospital . We should have operated the day Ajay and Rollie came home . Did we really think it was gonna get rid of their plaque ? It 's changing the crew 's genes . Anything 's possible . It doesn 't give us permission to be negligent . - Hi . - Hi . Thanks for calling . - Most guys would 've called their producers first . - How do you know I didn 't ? And I expect a little quid pro quo here , of course . Of course you do . Dr. Grottman to Admitting . Hey , Ajay . How are you ? I 'm fine . I 'll be fine . Tell me about the electrical problem on the Antares . After you come out of surgery , Ajay . It 's just a glitch . - How bad is he ? - He 's in surgery . But the good news is they don 't have to replace the valve . But what about Rollie ? He 'll have the same plaque procedure this afternoon . No one 's taking any chances . Look , this is emotional for all of us , okay ? But let 's not lose focus on the ship . Worst case ? You mean besides no Ajay to get us out of this ? Progressive overloads leading to a systemic shutdown ... like the New England blackouts last year . - That 's a long shot , but - - I don 't understand . The systems are redundant . - Can 't we switch from one subsystem to the other ? - Yeah . The ship 's programmed to do that automatically , and it 's been trying . This is somehow bridging systems . - I 'm gonna check the exterior maintenance panels for damage . - An E.V. A ? I 'm in . Donner only . You and Zoe ... can prep him and help with the egress and the ingress . I 'll be on the flight deck , monitoring . If this shutdown is systemic , we could lose power in the labs . I have embryos that could freeze . Then all of you should secure what you can and work in teams . Wass and Paula coming down ? He didn 't want to leave . She stayed with him . It 's getting really cold in here , Wass . This is stupid . It 's gonna be fine . Any minute , the rotor arm - Oh ! - Just twist and grab onto - - I know how to do it ! There 's gravity on the flight deck . And heat . - Well , then go ahead and leave . - I 'm really going . - So really go then ! - Fine . I 'm leaving . Good . Do you have a rash , Donner ? - I don 't think so . - It is really red behind your - Are those teeth marks ? I think Ted sent you down here to keep an eye on us . What 's the word for the person - Chaperone . The word is chaperone . And it 's not necessary . - Then Zoe can go . - No . Zoe will stay . Only because Ted assigned me , not because I want to . This has gotta be hell on him . - You know , on both of 'em . - Yeah . I can 't imagine flipping that switch , leaving two people behind . - Donner was sleeping with her . - What ? - Who ? - Sharon Lewis . Big romance . That 's why he won 't touch any of the ASCANs . - Too much potential drama . - Oh ! Donner ? I , uh - I didn 't mean anything in the classroom today . I mean ... I wasn 't trying to show you up or anything . I just thought it 's the most recent information , probably . You know , when I worked for the company ... there was always this pressure whenever a supervisor came around ... having to know absolutely everything about absolutely everything ... which is obviously impossible . My team , we came up with a code . In case one person got stuck ... somebody else could come and relieve them . We called it an H2I K sequence . - What 's an H2I K sequence ? - It means ... " Hell if I know . " It 's H2I K. It 's " Hell if I ... know . " - Hey , Sharma ? - Yeah ? Know when to shut up . Conventional wisdom says it 's forbidden to ask , but I am a shrink . So , wanna talk about it ? You wanna talk about those beauty marks ? It 's a simple cardio cath . They break up the plaque sonically , then suck it out . He 'll be able to walk off the table . Huh . Ev ? You all right ? Yeah . I just , uh , hate that . Well , it 's probably just the boys down at Mission Control playing with the mag grav . I bet they 're laughing at us right now . Are you gonna be all right if we - I can manage if you can . Okay . Okay , I 'll see you in a bit . All right . Flight deck , I 'm ready to egress . Uh , copy that , Donner . You 're go for a walk . - This is one hell of a backyard we got , Ted . - Roger that . We know it 's connected to the mag grav switches in Aft Sector 4 . - We knew that three hours ago . - And everything we do to pinpoint it seems to be making it worse . Look , I just told the president of the United States ... that we 'd have this cleared up by tomorrow morning . Don 't make a liar out of me . All right . I 'm proceeding to the exterior maintenance panels . You know the three of us are gonna be up here together for over six years , right ? And I know that you and Donner are going to screw ... knock boots , whatever . He 's a red-blooded guy , and you 're throwing yourself at him . I don 't have to throw myself at him . - We 've been sleeping together for years . - Fine . You have , yes . And with a little room , I can handle it . But up here - Up here , down there , we are going to do it ... - whether you like it or not . - Of course . Just don 't flaunt it at me , okay ? Don 't scar his body with little intimacies for me to see . Can you do that for me , Nadia ? Because he is all yours . We are not competing . We 've never been competing . I 'm a friend with benefits to Donner , nothing more . The person you 've been competing with is Sharon Lewis . Ted , I 'm looking at pristine panels . - Roger that . - They look as good as the day they were installed . I see no damage to the ship at all . She 's beautiful . - You should come in . - Roger that . Heading back to the airlock now . Sharon ? Exactly how long are we supposed to overlook the obvious possibility ? Do you honestly think after all these years and the direction it so clearly pushed us in ... Beta simply wants to strand your spacecraft ? Nothing else makes sense . Something will . Your guys just have to find it . And what is Williams doing down here ? Quid pro quo for sitting on Ajay and Rollie . The press is all over this electrical glitch anyway . He 's just getting a better view . Donner , are you coming in ? Donner , do you copy ? What is he doing ? Donner , do you have a problem ? Come back to me . Do you people mind if I join you ? Trevor Williams , British Television News . - We know who you are . - Oh . Okay , good . Oh ! Oh , sorry . Yeah , sure . Cop a squat . - Thanks very much . - No problem . So I assume you 're all here for the for the show , eh ? - Actually , we 're a little unsure what we 're doing here . I mean , aside from the fact that it 's the anniversary of the Mars mission - Well , that 's exactly the point , isn 't it ? Tonight , we get to be witnesses ... to prolonged torture disguised as tradition . Three single malts , Tom . Your finest Islay . Can you kill the music ? Why aren 't they saying anything ? They will . Someone will . There is no greater calling than to be an explorer . No greater ambition ... than to stretch the knowledge and reach of mankind . And there is glory in success . But it rides on the back of personal sacrifice . And it is that sacrifice that we salute here tonight . We raise our glasses to two explorers ... who gave their lives ... who reached as far as man has ever reached ... and paid the ultimate price . They were friends ... they were colleagues ... and they were true heroes . Sharon Lewis and Jeff Walker ... you inspire us . You humble us . And you will never be forgotten . Okay . What just happened there ? Am I clueless ? - Well , that goes without saying . - Clever . I don 't think anyone could have said anything that would have made Donner feel better . That 's not the point , Ajay . Goss just made Donner and Ted toast their own failure . Toast killing the woman he loved . So then why do it ? Why-Why show up at all ? Well , that 's the question , isn 't it ? Why allow Goss to torture you year after year ? Easy . Goss picks the crews . You 'll do it to fly . Donner , my man , this had better be a joke . Talk to me . Do you copy ? I can go out , help him back in . No one else leaves this ship . Talk to me , Donner . Donner , what the hell are you doing ? Donner , you are outside of your flight plan . Get back to the ship now ! Flight , we just lost Donner . Where does he think he 's going ? - I have no idea . - Donner ! Antares , this is Flight . Get him back on the ship . Maddux , you need to talk to me . Whatever you think you 're doing , stop it . We need you back on the ship . Donner , this is Zoe . Do you read ? Damn it , Donner . I need you , Donner . Stop . Donner ? I need you to come back to me . - Zoe ? - Donner , do you copy ? Yeah , I hear you , Z. You took off on us there , madman . Roger that . I thought I saw something come off the ship . Uh , I 'm headed back to the airlock now . We copy . Men only listen when they want to . Yeah . Damn . - You saw something come off the ship ? - Yeah . - What " something " would come off the ship ? - Like a panel or something . - So you chased after it ? - Yeah , I chased after it . - Why ? - Would you two stop ? Please ? Donner 's in . That 's what matters . Ah , terrific . Mission Control , you guys playing with me down there ? Guys ? Mission Control , are you on comm ? Ted ? Okay , that 's a third-stage failure . Half the comm is down . We can start thinking about a progressive blackout . Okay , we 're gonna need to call in some outside help from the contractors . How about some inside help ? Ajay Sharma should be sufficiently recovered by now . I think your quid pro quo just expired , Trevor . I 'll have a guard escort you back to the press floor . - Over half of the ship is out . - They 're not telling me squat . - They telling you anything ? - Not enough . - We need Ajay . - Yes , we need Ajay . - He should be conscious now . - You know how Goss feels . - Screw Goss . It 's our ship . - It 's his command . It 's our ship , Ted . - Hi . - Hey . - You enjoy the show ? - Oh ! Takes a particular kind of jackass . That he is . You know , I understand the whole ... isolated , " I can do anything " stud astronaut part of you . L - I really do . But it doesn 't un-man you to need someone else at certain times . I just really don 't think you should be alone tonight . You 're right . Good night . Calliope , this is Zeus . We 're showing that the dust is breaching your thruster controls . This storm 's on the rise . We 're losing your launch window . Copy that , Zeus . Yeah , it 's looking bad down here . - How far out are they ? - 100 meters . We 're holding . - Hey . - Hey , brother . You know , three things . Burn that damn recording . We 're never gonna toast again . And from now on ... we never spend this anniversary alone . Ajay . Yeah , it 's your command , but it 's our ship . - We want Ajay . - Negative . He 's not healthy . Yeah , neither 's the ship . If he 's conscious , he 'll want to help save it . What do you have to lose ? Mike . Get the schematics , the test data , and uplink to the hospital . Right away , sir . - Look-Look who came back . - I never left . I was in my quarters . Oh . Do you have any sweaters ? Yeah . Lower left bin . - You don 't have to do this , you know . - Yeah , Wass . - I really do . - Why ? I mean ... why help me after the whole Paula Puke business ? Is it the whole " Jesus said turneth thou cheeketh ' " thing ? No . It 's not because of the wholeJesus thing . - Then why ? - It 's because you 'll freeze to death if I don 't . Yeah , that 's a good point . Evram ? Evram ? Are you in here ? Evram ? No ! Hey ! Evram ! Evram , you 're okay . You 're okay . I got you . I got you . You 're okay . You 're okay , Evram . You 're right here . You 're right here with me . It 's okay . I got you . Hey , buddy . Gave us a little bit of a scare there . Yes . Well , luckily , Surgical is more astute than Diagnostic . Listen , we 're in a spot up here . Kind ofhoping you had a can of monkey grease laying around for our squeaky door . I 've seen the 1500 briefs . Is there anything you can add to them ? No . That 's about it . You get a chance to take a look ? Yeah . And ? From what I have here , looks to me like an H2I K sequence . H2I K , huh ? You sure ? I 'm positive . Start at the beginning , work your way through it . It 's the only way to complete the sequence . - Okay ? - Okay . Roger that . That 's what we 'll do . We 'll start and work that sequence from the beginning . All right . You get better , Ajay . Demand sponge baths from the nurses . You deserve it . Okay . - Fix it , Donner . - So , H2I K ? Yeah . It stands for " Hell if I know . " He didn 't know what it is . It 's time , Wass . We have to get out ofhere . - Come on ! What are you so afraid of ? - I 'm not af - People are just wired differently , okay ? And maybe - maybe we don 't necessarily like the way we 're wired . But that 's the way it is . And wanting to be different is just a waste of time . So why bother ? Well , that 's all you 're getting . What happened , Evram ? Where were you ? In the war . The lights triggered it . Posttraumatic stress syndrome ? And this never happened during training ? I 've been medicating for alcohol withdrawal . I think these patches are bad . Does Claire know ? Of course she knows . Well , we 'll just keep it between you and me then . - So he had no idea ? - None . I didn 't wanna burn him with Goss anymore . We could always turn around . - Not an option . - Why ? Why continue on a dead ship ? We could direct abort and be home in a month . - I 'm just saying . - Look , there 's a solution , all right ? To every problem , there 's a solution . We just have to go back and work it from the beginning . It 's not software . Ted went through everything in the mainframe . Has to be hardware . - Has to be a short . - It can 't be a simple short . This entire ship is polymer coated to avoid that exact thing . They wrench in these circuits , and that 's it . - What is it ? - The mag grav . I already looked here . What is it ? The short seems to go on and off with the mag grav . And it 's jumping subsystems like it 's moving , right ? - So ? - So , you ever hear one of those stories ... about a doctor who sews up a patient ... but he accidentally leaves a clamp in somebody 's chest ? Back in the Dark Ages . Well , if the circuit housing and the insulation 's too thin ... - and for some reason , there 's a large enough piece astray - Conductive metal - you wind up with all kinds of problems . - Whoa ! - Oh ! How much do you weigh ? You 're a moron . Ah , yes . A wrench ? Just a wrench ? Ferrous assembly wrench , about yea big , straddling all three bus lines . Mag grav kept shifting it around ... and that 's what kept me from seeing it in the first place . - Well , good thinking , Donner . - It didn 't come from me . Okay ? Ajay hadn 't had me run that H2I K sequence , I 'd have never found it . - We need Ajay on the floor , Mike . - Listen , I 'm not prepared to - - We need Ajay . - Ajay . - Ajay . - Put him back on the floor as soon as he 's healthy , Mike . Don 't test us . In the Hall thruster , xenon gas is injected into the chamber ... where it 's passed through a Hall current and stripped of electrons . - Yes . - What 's a Hall current ? That 's a good question . Uh - That 's the Hall current right there . Okay ? It 's a current - And it was first discovered by a guy named Hall ... uh , back in the - I believe it was the 1800s . Uh , and Hall ... who was also an early pioneer of the H2I K sequence - - Uh - Yes . - Sorry . Is that Edwin Hall ? Was it his sequence that showed that ... when electric and magnetic fields are set perpendicular to each other ... inside a conductor , that an electric field ... flows in a direction perpendicular to both fields ? Yep . Exactly right . That 's the Hall current . Answer your question ? - Yeah . - Okay , moving on . Like it or not , man , by his very nature ... is dependent on other men . - We call ourselves explorers . - All right . Independent , courageous . Ajay , we 're reinstating you . Welcome back to the floor . But what are we without the support of our brothers ? I mean , how far do we really get if we try to do everything alone ... when the simplest , smallest thing can bring the whole world around you ... grinding to a halt ? I want peace of mind . Donner ? The guys whipped up some dinner in quarters . I want to rely on my brother - I 'll be right down . And know that he 'll find the wrench if I don 't . Mmm . Ahh . English - US - SDH

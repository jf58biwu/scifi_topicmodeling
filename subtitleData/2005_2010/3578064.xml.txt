 Previously on Defying Gravity : We believe that this lot of libido inhibitors is contaminated . Think we sold them on the halos ? Paula cant pilot that lander Beta chose Paula . It didn 't injure her thumb . - My thumb If she 's not the one it will let us know . What ? - Paula failed . Like Job I feel I am being tested . As if Satan himself were on this ship . Rollie , there is a thing onboard with us . A thing you knew about and didnt mention to me . So while this is thoughtful and sweet doesnt make that right . When we got married we made a rule . We could get angry , fight , slam doors , sulk . In three hours time we would come back and discuss it . What do we do after three hours up here , Rollie ? Oh my god . Oh my god . Defying Gravity S01E11 " Solitary " Eng Sub : Anreith | Darkside Hey ! I get to make a call ! Like most kids I used to play hide and seek in my neighbourhood . Best place to hide was an old barrel behind the garage . I used to climb in and pretend I was John Glenn orbiting Earth in Freedom Seven . And I never got found . But I did discover that after about an hour a barrel can get pretty cramped and lonely . Just like the life of an astronaut . So , Rollie didn 't call me . And I didn 't call him . I think make-up sex is probably a long shot . I guess that 's what happens when the 3-hour rule passes up here . Nothing . Sorry . All right guys , so , Forum 24 today . - T minus 23 hours until Venus landing and Zoes walk . What ? Not doing my job isn 't gonna make this thing go away . Zoe , you are under orders to rest . - Its just a 20 minute walk . In 460 degree weather . You need to conserve energy today . Fine . - Donner , MC want you to run the landing simulation . Everyone else T-1 Standard . Why not " Business as usual " ? - Because we 're astronauts . Ahhh , good morning sunshine . - Morning Steven . I 'm okay . I 'm sorry , I got a little overwhelmed yesterday . But I 'm okay . - Good , now that we 're all okay , Let 's get going . Oh , if you need help running the lander sims I 've been helping Paula a week . I 've spent time in landers too , I think I can manage . You rest . Ted ! I would love to do my space classroom on the Venus Suit today . Any objections ? - I dont , but MC does You 've been ordered to have a psych eval with our good doctor . How are they doing ? - They 're rattled , Eve . Now , we trained hard . But not for this . You did . You just didn 't know it at the time . So you are going to make history tomorrow . We made history on Mars too . - We are doing it right this time . What if we 're not ? - If we 're not then I was wrong . And we have wasted billions of dollars . Fifteen years . - And lives ! Eve , lives ! Walker and Sharon . Zoe , Donner . Ted , that is not going to happen . We 're gonna be okay . I developed the halos that they sell at Mertman Cinco ( ? ) . 20 years ago . We have never , in clinical trials or active use , ever had hallucinations caused by the halos . Well , maybe one batch went wrong and ISO got it . There 's thousands of halos in a batch . We sell the things to prisons , to priests . So the press release from ISO - Is a lie . It 's a total fabrication . But you have to get somebody from ISO to collaborate that Why do you care ? It 's my retirement . And my grandkids college fund . And I get one percent of all sales . Kim , where 's Goss ? - No idea . You know you 're lucky that the cop who picked you up washed out as an astronaut candidate back in 2043 Because he called me . Your blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit . - Is she okay ? If that girl dies , you 're looking at vehicular man slaughter Thats 25 years . No parol . - Mike , just tell me Is the girl okay or not ? - She 's in a coma , holding on . What the hell have I done ? Uh , I have to talk to Jen . - No you don 't . You are not calling Jen . She won 't hear about this . And you are gonna sit silently . While I figure something out . You twelve were lucky enough to ge the first shift for sensory deprivation training . This is how we find out who can handle the preassure of being alone in space and who can 't . What happened to " there is no ' I ' in ' Team ' " ? This is how it works : You 're in the tank until we pull you out . Could be a half hour , could be two days . You can expect periodic noises , we don 't want anyone napping . Why is he looking at me ? Feels like he was looking at me when he said that . Listen up . This is a requirement , people . Noone goes any further until the excercise is complete , Is that clear ? We 'll start in ten . Dude , this is it , man , this is totally it . What are you talking about ? One of the old AIs told me that after sense-dep training everybody gets laid . Yeah , man , something about being alone and then needing ... to not be alone . That doesnt sound like its particularely scientific . Doesn 't need to be . - It 's not . Don 't crush my dreams , doc . Guaranteed sex tonight . Guaranteed sex to-niiight . Don 't leave me hanging . There you go . Ey mamacita . Sooo ... sensory deprevation training Handsome , vulnerable , kind of broken Targeting Mintz to help you blow off some steam later ? Don 't be ridiculous , I 'm gonna be sleeping alone , in my own bed tonight . - Amen to that . Said the bitter space nun . - What , me , bitter ? Come on . Not even a word of support ? What is wrong ? Nothing . Im fine . Really . This will be like an afternoon in a jacuzzi Yeah , except jacuzzis are in open air , with other people , with delicious beverages , with tiny umbrellas . Okay , once we get through this we will go to Major Tom 's and consume delicious beverages , with tiny umbrellas . Deal ? - Deal Wass , tank One . Wess in Two , Schilling Three , Barentz Four . I hear tonight can 't help but be hot . Can you do me ? - Sure Zipper . Are we still on ? - For tonight , yeah , I 'll see you at Tom 's . - Great So , I 've got room to spare , ladies , if anyone gets lonely , wants a chat . No ? Not mad if you 're curious . Jen ? - Oh , yeah . Good to go . Get me out ! Somebody get me out ! Let me out ! Easy , easy easy , easy . Easy . Thank you . For the record , I didn 't last five minutes my first time . But , it is a requirement . You have to pass . Well , then I guess I 'm out . Jen , I promise you , if this is the reason why you burn out of the program you will never forgive yourself . You know what to expect now , you can push yourself through it . Y-You dont , uhm , You don 't understand . Look . I will get you into a later group . You can at least try it again . Yeah . Sure , whatever . It 's exactly what we need . Soon as you get it , let me know . Heeey . Alright ? Thanks . They didn 't keep you in there very long . What happened ? Your place . Right now . Will you marry me ? - Uhum Thirty meters . Twenty meters . Ten meters . Stand by . Touchdown . Landing secured . Even with the musical accompaniment . Hey , sure you dont need any help ? You 're supposed to be resting . Oh , well , talking to you isn 't exactly taxing . You 're supposed to be completely off your feet . Its a chaloric burn thing , like prepping for a marathon . Why don 't you go watch a movie ? No , there 's nothing on . - Read a book . I 've read them all . - Practice your first line . What ? - Your line , you know . What you 're going to say , you 're the first woman on Venus . I hope you have a line . Right ? - Yeah I hope it 's better than Walkers : " Red Planet Conquered , the warrior brought to his knees . " Of course it is . - Okay How 's he doing ? - Perfectly , we 've run three different simulations three times each and he 's nailed it every time . Can we wrap this up , Donner ? Let 's have one more time through , I want 549 B , it 's the last one , promise . 549 B , wind gusting at 15 km / h , storm system moving in from east . Im in . Watch your pitch . - I got side winds coming in . Hang on , I 'm gonna pummel through this . Thirty meters . Twenty meters . Ten . Simulation failed . Alright , going again . I have nothing to say . - I find that hard to believe . No , I 'm going down to Venus tomorrow , and they 're gonna record whatever I say when I get there in the annals of history forever , and I 've got nothing . - I 'm sure you 'll think of something . " Through difficulties to the stars . " - Venus is a planet Its Seneca , its a famous latin quote . See , I took Mandarin . You know , one of the useful languages ? And by the way , aren 't you supposed to be resting ? I 'm going to Venus tomorrow - I know , we know , the whole world knows . Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . I 'm sorry about before . - Yeah Are you still fighting with Rollie ? How did you get " I 'm fighting with Rollie " from " I 'm fine " ? Just because you say you 're fine doesn 't make it true . It 's okay to reach out and ask for help sometimes , Jen . Zoe , I 'm fine . Call . Rollie . I 'm leaving . I 'm gonna go . I know I messed up yesterday . I get it . Its just , I dont know what to think about Beta . At first I thought it was God , showing me my miracle , But then it kept me from passing my landing test . Why would it do that ? - I dont know . You said that you think it shows us things we feel guilty about . Just a theory . - Based on what ? Back in the war , there was a girl trapped inside a building . I tried to save her , and ... didn 't . The scar on your back ? - Yeah . And that 's what you were hallucinating about ? Like I said , its just a theory . - But I dont feel guilty about Hector . Hector was my miracle . - Your miracle ? Yes . Beta shows me my miracle . Hector is why I believe . He 's alive . - It 's a miracle . Noise to keep us from napping . Whatever . I could sleep through World War four . How was your stay in solitary ? - Easy I saw my miracle and I knew I wasn 't alone . Hey , you wanna be my miracle , baby ? You 're disgusting Steven . What about you , blondie ? Wanna be my miracle ? I 'm gonna suggest you never say that to anybody . Ever again . It is both creepy and gross . Oh yeah , well , that 's what I was going for . 42 seconds . I think that must be a new world record for worst performance ever by an astronaut candidate . No . But you do know it is a requirement and , you can get cut . So I 've heard . - You know what you need ? You need mind over matter . What the hell are you talking about ? You don 't mind , I don 't matter . - Oh , gosh , such a cheezeball . It 's dark and quiet . It 's not so bad , right ? No . It 's not so bad under here with you . My proposal is this : An evening of dangerous games , followed by ... Again . Creepy and gross . - Sorry How did it go today ? - Fine Wow , you sound like an astronaut . One-word-answer , flat delivery . Just have to work on that drink . You alone tonight ? No , Im not alone . We 're here . Together . Really ? - Hanging out , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we 're just hanging out , man . You guys are hanging out ? Doing what ? Playing darts , having some beverages You don 't play darts . - I love darts She 's really really good . - Well , lets go - No ! Now ? - Yeah , you love darts Come on honey , you can join us . - Thanks ... - That 's me , it 's me . I got , I got , I got it . Hey . Oh , okay . Okay . It was Rollie , he got me back in . - Bueno Would you , uhm , come with me ? It might not be so bad if I know you 're out there . Okay . I 'll try . But just let me take a shower first . Sure . You okay ? - Yeah . I go in in half an hour . Schilling . How was it ? - Like taking a nice warm bath . So what is the miracle that Beta shows you ? Hector used to wait for me to come home from school That day I saw Hector by the window as always . I walked in , somehow Hector got out . He was dead . I begged God to give him back to me . And he did . God answered my prayers . God sent Hector back to me , as a reward for my faith . I dont care what it costs to bury this . Just make it happen . I 've been looking for you all morning . Their genomes have held steady since that first mutation , but in the last week they 've mutated again . We 've been over this , Doctor . We could be looking at serious medical problemss down the line , what 's gonna happen when they pick up Gamma ? We hope for the best . - We have to tell them ! I need you to go back out to your station and do your job . I 'm trying , but you seem hellbent on making that impossible . Sir . Claire , we have just regained a modicum of equilibrium . If I tell the crew that their genes might be changing , what does that gain me ? So . How was it for you ? I thought it was kind of relaxing . Once you got past the weird sensation of not knowing where your body ends and the water begins . Kindof like having a few drinks . - Yeah So , I 've already had two glasses of whine and if I don 't get some food I might get to that place where I make bad choices . Like dancing-on-the-bar-bad choices ? - It 's really not pretty . So , I was wondering , if you 'd like to save me , from myself , by getting some food . I know this Italian place , its ... - Claire I like you . A lot . Which is why I 'm gonna say no . I 'm not the guy you want to get involved with . Well , why don 't I be the judge of that . Trust me . Hey . - Hey . You ready ? - No . That 's the spirit . Have you , uhm , seen Ted ? - No , no I havent . You okay ? Jen , look . You are putting way too much on this . Between you and me , it 's kindof a stupid exercise ISO and the space program have built-in redundancy . I mean , there are nine ways to solve every problem . You 're never alone , somebody has always got your back . Look , try this : " Six sick slick slim sycamore saplings " I 'm sorry , I don 't even know what to say to that . It 's a tongue twister . And it 's harder than you think . Trust me , focus on getting that right and , you won 't think about this . And I 'm gonna be here the whole time , okay ? " Six sick slick slim sycamore saplings " Six ... sick ... slim ... Six ... six ... sick ... sick ... sick ... sycamore ... . saplings ... six ... sick slick slim sycamore saplings Six sick slick slim ... sycamore saplings . Six sick slim slick sycamore saplings . I am talking to a bunny . Good work . Okay . - Hey Jen . Kim ? I 'm sorry , isn 't Rollie there ? He should be on shift by now . - Yeah he had to go to Bertran head quarters . Last minute all day meetings , mission status updates . Do you want me to leave him a message ? Why don 't I just call him ? He 's not reachable ? Communication lockdown until he leaves Bertran head quarters . Their rules , not ours . - Okay . Alright , thanks . Damn - Well that did it You are officially the worst dart player in the world . You want some tips ? - No Uaaaaahhh Bathroom , right now . I don 't even want to wait to get you home . Oh my god , it 's even better from this angle Is everything okay ? - Everything is fine . Why wouldn 't it be ? I don 't know , just checking . Okay , I have a game here , how about you let me finish ? and I 'll buy you a drink . - What do we need to win ? Double twenty . I love darts . Thought you got the golden ticket to do nothing all day . Looks like you 're working . I haven 't got a thing to say . - Then say nothing at all . Ah , yeah , hadn 't thought of that . I dunno . Doesn 't have much of a ring to it . What are we talking about ? - Venus , need an opening line . Oh , you should totally be like - That isn 't dirty I ... - Or juvenile We could all - Or incomprehensible to anyone without five years of post-grad math . Yeah I got nothing for you there . Why did Donner even say anything to me ? You know , I would 've been fine , just gone down there , and something would have rolled of my tongue . Okay , take it up with him then , he 's still in the lander . Still ? Simulation failed Run it again . Alright , brother . Let 's take a break . - Yeah , I 'm not gonna get a break tomorrow , so why take one today ? Donner , this is an insanely hard simulation , okay ? The only reason it exists , is to prove to dumb jock pilots that they can 't land in every condition . This is designed to be impossible . Its not impossible , I 've done it before . Let 's go ! We would never launch in these conditions , okay ? It would never happen . Come on , take a break . Tomorrow , I 'm gonna be down there with Zoe , and you 're gonna be safe and sound up here like Goss was . Im not Goss . And this is not Mars . Nadia , let 's run it again . So , Hector came back to life because of your prayer . Yes - Okay How did he get out ? Did you leave the door open ? No . I walked in , I closed the door and I locked it like always . Well how did it get open ? Someone else leave the door open ? God needed for Hector to be on that street . So I could witness that miracle . He makes all things possible . - So Hector goes from lying in the road , dead , to the sidewalk , breathing in your arms . Yes . - And how does he get from the street to the sidewalk ? That 's part of the miracle . Are we done ? - Tell me again about that door . You doing okay , Claire ? - I 'm fine . If you need to talk to someone - I dont need to talk to someone , Eve Do you realize what we 're doing here ? This is a ten trillion dollar experiment without a control . I know . - What kind of science is that ? So much could 've been done with that money on earth instead we send eight people across the galaxy with a rock that we have no idea what ... It 's about faith , Claire . And you know I 'm not talking the religious kind . Now , I dont know where I come down on God , but I have faith in those eight astronauts , and in Beta . Well , I 'm a scientist , and a doctor . And my only concern is the well-being of that crew . I can 't just take things on faith . And neither should you . I walked in , Hector got out . How many times do I have to tell you ? So you didn 't forget to close the door ? No . - Do you remember who else was home ? I can tell you who wasn 't home . My mother . - Okay . Tell me about that . I don 't wanna talk about this anymore . You 're just questioning my faith . Because you have none of your own . Paula . Paula , we 're not finished here . Yes we are . You know , you strike me as more a usually Cabinet never Chardonnay type of drinker . - What ? You just don 't seem like the type for Whiskey shots . Are you secretly judging me ? - No , no no . Sounded like judgement . - No , just being observant . What , did sense deprivation training get to you ? Sure , let 's go with that . - You know , I read somewhere that the best crew to send up into space would be a group of Buddhist monks . Think about it . They shut off all desire , they meditate all the time . They focus on their religion . Maybe I should try that . Mind you , just sounds really bloody boring , doesnt it ? Okay . Come here . Come here , I 'm gonna help you . No , I dont need your help . - Yeah , you do . If only for the safety of Tommy 's patrons , okay ? That guy was not hurt . - Alright , yaw left . Put your arm out . Now it 's all about touch . You want to be solid , but relaxed . Okay , just let the dart fly itself . Solid , but relaxed . Take your time . That 's it . Beautiful . Don 't get any better than that . Alright ? - Yeah That 's perfect . - Thank you . How about you buy me one more drink and take me home ? Okay , yeah yeah . That sounds like a plan . Ehhh , have a good night . - You too . Tchau Thanks . So , I guess Ted never showed , huh ? Well , there was a meeting , he probably got pulled into it . Right . - Hey , come on . You did it . Yaay . Why dont you let me take you out for a drink ? I think I 've been more than enough trouble , Rollie . I should just cut my losses and head home . Thanks . - Jen , you are never any trouble . I couldn 't have made it through this without you , Rollie . Thank you . - Anytime . So this is how this is gonna work : You 're back on the floor starting tomorrow . What ? And this cost ISO a small fortune so we would really appreciate it if you keep this to yourself . As far as you 're concerned , this never happened . What about the girl ? Did you hear me ? It never happened . - This is messed up . Is that what you plan to tell her family , Mike ? You 're gonna tell them nothing ever happened ? Is that what you 're gonna tell her , if she ever wakes up , nothing ever happened ? I may not have killed her , but you probably wont walk again , but nothing ever happened ? Did it , Mike ? Now I 'm supposed to just walk the hell outta here ? Because nothing ever happened . Go home and call your wife . She 's been looking for you . Can I help you ? Woah , woah . Hey , those are vintage . Hey , hey . Shhh . It 's okay . I messed up . Just hold me . So , how 's Paula ? - She 's okay on the surface but there 's something underneath it all . Something she 's hiding . Repressing . I think I can help her once I figure it out . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . It 's just one of those days . Je t 'aime . - I love you too . Bye . Thirty meters . Simulation failed . - Alright , going again . End simulation . - You can 't be in here ! You 're throwing me off my game . You 're holding on too tight . - What ? It 's all about touch . Solid but relaxed . Alright , get out of here . - I 'm not going anywhere . Twenty meters . Ten meters . Touchdown . SIMULATION COMPLETE Alright , Nadia , let 's call it , I think I 'm good . All good . Isolation is a fact of life in space . I don 't know if there 's any real training for it . There certainly isn 't a cure . Most of the time isolation is self-imposed . Sorry . I got called into a meeting at MC . - Jen ? Sometimes by shutting people out . Please , dont . Jen , dont . Jen . Sometimes by inviting people in . And sometimes by hiding alone in an oak barrel . Sometimes by losing faith in things that keep us going . What are you doing here ? You were there for me before I left for Antares . I 'm here for you tonight . Uhm ... I think , I think I 'm okay . Well ... I 'm not . I 'm terrified . We lean on each other . Seek solace where we think we 'll find it . But sometimes its just unavoidable . There 's nothing to do but embrace the isolation . And walk out into the void , alone .

 Lake Toya , Hokkaido G8 Summit Venue We 've got enough here , Sanpei . Let 's go look around . Sure . Wow ... What an amazing view ! It 's the perfect place for a summit on man 's coexistence with nature . But is there any point to it ? It 's the 33rd one they 've had . Yeah . The world 's just going from bad to worse . It 's still better than doing nothing , isn 't it ? You 're in the way . We came all the way here . One shot of me won 't hurt . You 're so mean . What 's that ? Hm ? That sound . Don 't you hear it ? That 's strange . I could swear the sound came from around here . Nobody would live this far out . Sumire , didn 't we already pass by here ? I can 't remember if we did or not . I 'm sure we did . I don 't think so . It 's too risky . I don 't want to get lost out here . Let 's go back . Wait . It 's this way . Sumire ! Wait , Sumire , let 's not go any farther in ! Sumire ! Down in the lake , deep in the woods , birds cry out , stars shine down . After an eternity , he endured so long to stand before us . The warrior of the ancients , Take-Majin . Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Down in the lake , deep in the woods , birds cry out , stars shine down .

Neci-Coma ! Bless us with your miracle . Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Hear us , oh god of antiquity . Even a kid 's involved ... I 've never seen such a weird dance . Japan hides many secrets . Down in the lake , deep in the woods , birds cry out , stars shine down . After an eternity , he endured so long to stand before us . The warrior of the ancients , Take-Majin . Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Hear us , oh god of antiquity . Keep going . Don 't mind us . Who are you people ? Um , we 're ... We 're reporters from Tokyo Sports covering the Summit . We wanted to learn more about the local culture . Leave . Um ... Leave ! This isn 't good , Sumire . Let 's go . G8 Summit - Lake Toya , Hokkaido While the Kyoto Protocol was drawn up here in this very country Japan hasn 't reduced its carbon dioxide emission , but rather increased it by 8 % . This is no way to set an example for the nations of the world . I 'd like to hear Prime Minister Ibe 's outlook on what will be done . What do you plan to do ? Prime Minister Ibe , what are your thoughts ? Well , in that regard , er ... we 're doing our best , in a constructive manner ... Through environmental taxes , development of eco-friendly technology ... Although , we 're hindered by numerous problems ... Excuse me . I must visit the restroom . Our country is now warmer , and we enjoy the nicer weather . We rather welcome this global warming . How can you say that ? If global warming continues , do you have any idea what 'll happen to our Earth ? She 's right . Pizza is the only thing that needs to be warm . What 's so funny ? How dare you ! City of Sapporo I understand what you 're saying , but when I speak about my beautiful country , Japan ... What ? There 's a monster in Sapporo ? Monster X Strikes Back Attack the G8 Summit ! Cast Natsuki Kato Kazuki Kato Hide Fukumoto , Akira Matsushita Matabe Watabe , ( The Newspaper ) Bin Furuya Susumu Kurobe Yosuke Natsuki Beat Takeshi Directed by Minoru Kawasaki Mamma mia ! I 'm Director-General Narumi of Japan 's Defense Forces . It seems this monster landed here from outer space . We 're checking into it further , but as it can fly , this venue itself is in danger . Sir , we beg you to tell all the heads of state to return home immediately . Everyone , due to the current emergency , I wish to suspend the summit . We will escort you home safely . Please don 't worry . This way , quickly ... Hurry , please . This way . Mr. President , what would your nation do if something happens to you ? That 's the last thing they want to see . I 'll stay ... to get it on with that monster . I 'm staying too . Angelika , why do you stand alongside the US President ? If I go back to Germany now , the male members of parliament would laugh and say that I 'm scared of the monster because I am a woman . I do this not just for me but for the women of the world . So I shall stay and fight . I 'll stay too . The wisdom of Ancient Rome may prove useful . I don 't get it . Why are you always so quick to exclude Russia ? Russia remains as well . However , not because the US told us to . Just north of Hokkaido , the Russian motherland begins . Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands are ours . As Supreme Commander of Russian Forces , I shall remain here . I appreciate your support , but those islands belong to Japan . Give it up , already . Sure ... G8 Summit - Lake Toya , Hokkaido G8 Space Monster Task Force HQ Although we haven 't identified the monster , we think it emerged from a meteorite which fell from outer space . Where in outer space ? Please wait while we investigate the details . Let me read the G8 's recently-approved joint statement . The era of Earth 's nations fighting each other is over . " Henceforth , we cooperate to rid the world of this monster 's threat . " This agreement is signed by Russia , the US , Germany , Canada , Italy , Japan , France , and the UK , thus confirming the G8 's resolve . That is all ! Wait a moment ! Wait a moment ! Are there any concrete measures ? I 'll update you soon . Which planet is it from ? Details are unclear , but the G8 will spearhead the resistance . They haven 't identified it , but it 's from a meteorite , apparently . Understood . Cancel Summit articles . Only monster specials from now on . It 's currently flying toward the Pacific . A " scoop " ? Exactly . We 're a tabloid . We can 't just print monster stuff like everyone else . We 've done UFOs and ghosts , and now we 've got a real monster ! Go grab that perfect scoop , got it ? But press restrictions are so tight we 'll just get the same as the others . Nonsense ! Remember , we 're the Tokyo Sports Daily ! Quit moping around . Get out there ! Whatever angle you want ... I leave it up to you . Do whatever you have to to get an exclusive scoop ! I 'll do my best , sir . I 'm counting on you . Go for it ! Ready to go ? Yeah , let 's go ! Special news report Giant monster appears in Sapporo What 's up ? It 's like I 've seen it before ... Where ? Forget it . The monster is now flying southeast over Hokkaido . At this rate , it 'll reach the Pacific by this evening . I 'd be happy if it leaves Japan . If we strike while it 's over the Pacific , we 'll limit collateral damage . Yes , sir . Hey . You keep saying " Monster , " but let 's give it a name . I like the sound of " Guilala . " He 's like a Gila monster I saw in a zoo . No way ! And civilians aren 't allowed in here . Hey . Sir ! What 're you doing in here ? Come with us . Let me go ! Excuse me , sir ! According to recent intelligence , the object thought to have produced Guilala wasn 't a meteorite , but China 's Mars probe " AAC-Beta . " Germans don 't like things " Made in China " either . Dr. Sano of the Space Creature Research Center is analyzing the debris . Dr. Sano ? Sano , here . What have you found so far ? I 'm clarifying the details , but it appears a cosmic spore seeking an energy source adhered to the nozzle of the Mars probe . When it crashed in Sapporo , the resulting explosion allowed the spore to absorb vast amounts of hi-temp energy . Then gravitational differences on Earth , among other factors , brought about the transformation we witnessed . We hope to have China recognize the damage Guilala caused to Japan and to claim compensation from them in due course . They won 't pay you in a million years . Dr. Sano ... Do you think the monster , presently airborne over Hokkaido , will keep moving toward the Pacific and leave Japan ? Unfortunately , I do not . The Pacific doesn 't contain the hi-temp energy it wants . So it 's not likely to leave Hokkaido ? I can 't say conclusively , but the chance it will remain is extremely high . Excuse me , sir ! The monster is approaching Noboribetsu power plant ! What ? One moment , Mr. President . We Japanese are devising a plan to stop Guilala based on Dr. Sano 's analysis . Allow us more time . Damn , there 's a roadblock . Can 't we go any farther ? Guilala is up ahead , so we can 't let you pass . We reporters have a duty to inform the people . Please contact the PR section at Military HQ . Then every article will be the same . In a crisis , false reports might give rise to mass panic . News of Guilala 's movements must be cleared with HQ . That 's manipulation of the media . Press freedom guards the people 's right to know . Are you trying to reinstate militarism ? Sumire . It 's okay . Let 's go back . It 's not okay ! Why leave ? It 's no use arguing with the rank and file . Then how do we get a scoop ? It 's frustrating , I know . But let 's find another way . Like what ? Let 's try and think . Let 's find a new angle the military hasn 't figured out . If that 's even possible ... So here we have Guilala , right ? It 's my childhood dream come true . Although I wish it had been Varan or Baragon . Better if they 'd appeared all at once , really ... Many in Sapporo have died , y 'know ? Well , that 's inevitable . It 's how these things happen . Lots more will die . That 's how monsters show their power . Personally , I wouldn 't mind . It 's a perfect way to go . Lily Franky , Q : What are your thoughts on the Guilala Sapporo attack ? Not many tourists are in Sapporo right now . In any case , the environment 's ruined , right ? Rather than doing nothing and watching it collapse under the logic of capitalism , this monster destruction shows us just how wrong we 've been ... It actually might make things turn out for the best . Isn 't Guilala amazing ? It 's just going crazy . Nothing we can do , really . How will it all end ? Any way you slice it , isn 't Guilala just incredible ? Here in Noboribetsu , " Guilala hot cakes " are selling like hot cakes . They keep selling out . Here 's the store . Excuse me , how 's business ? I feel bad for the victims , but business is business . It 's revitalizing our town . Try some candy . It 's our latest product . Get your candy here ! Reporting from Noboribetsu ... That 's terrible . For Japanese people , Guilala is just a way to make money . They better laugh while they can ... This piece of news just in . According to the Earth Defense Army 's Japan HQ , today sees the deployment of the new Vulture missile against Guilala near Mt . Showa . I repeat ... That cake shop will be history . Why at Mt . Showa ? Guilala is in Noboribetsu ... No idea . But let 's hurry and snag the best spot . Noboribetsu Power Plant Noboribetsu Power Plant Colonel Kimura , explain our strategy . Yes , sir . We stimulate the subterranean magma using a special microwave frequency . As the magma gathers under Mt . Showa , it accumulates the hi-temp energy which will attract Guilala there . After Guilala 's absorbed the power plant 's energy , there 's no doubt it 'll fix its attention on Mt . Showa . That 's where we 'll deploy the Earth Defense Force Japan 's latest missile , and at point-blank range , blast it away . I doubt you can manipulate the magma that simply , though . Don 't worry . Japan is a world leader in earthquakes . Our magma research is top-notch . All staff , maintain a frequency of 380 . What about this , professor ? Make it A3 . A3 , it is . Good morning . Is Guilala really coming ? We 'll be in trouble if it doesn 't . What 's the situation ? We 've activated most of the magma . Hi-temp energy is really building beneath Mt . Showa . Miyake of 2nd Unit to Captain Soma . What is Guilala 's status ? No change . He 's not leaving the power plant . Understood . Please increase the frequency . That 'd be dangerous . The mountain may erupt . Just slightly ... to see what happens . I developed this system to suppress earthquakes . You 're proposing I do the exact opposite . It 's so we can defeat Guilala . Please . To all staff , we 're raising the frequency to 600 for one minute only . Understood , sir . Earthquake ! Look out ! Helmets , everyone ! Secure the equipment ! Evacuate ! Wait ! Don 't leave us ! Throw the switch ! Turn it off ! Throw the switch ! Help ! Is the Vulture okay ? No problems , sir ! It reminds me of Naples . Thank you very much . I heard nothing about an eruption . Yes , sir . I 'll find out . 2nd Ground Unit , come in . 1st Unit , Soma here ... Guilala noticed . It 's looking at Mt . Showa . It 's flying ! It 's airborne ! It 's heading right for us , sir ! Ready the Vulture ! Here it comes . Deploy into formation ! Yes , sir ! Did you get it ? It 's Guilala ! It 's here at Mt . Showa ! In real life , it 's huge and terrifying ! Will Japan 's strategy stand a chance ? It 's all going according to plan . Target the Vulture at Guilala . Get a target lock on Guilala . Locking on Guilala , sir . Mr. Prime Minister ... The launch button ... Please . Feel free , Mr. President . It ate it ! This is unbelievable ! Guilala just ate the missile ! Guilala ate our Vulture ... Good question ... Excuse me , it 's my bowels again ... Japan hasn 't seen real combat for over half a century . Asking her to defeat Guilala was far more than she could handle . Please everyone , don 't lose heart . They say , " When the cat 's away , the mice will play . " What does that mean ? It 's like when we say " Wash when the devil 's away . " Let 's devise our next strategy . I happen to have a good idea . Guilala is still absorbing magma energy from Mt . Showa . Under the eyes of the world , Japanese forces bet everything , but failed utterly . We 'll wait and see what strategy the G8 comes up with next . Here 's the memory card . Deadline 's soon . Thanks . I 'll go write my report . Hey , wait ! You know something about Guilala , don 't you ? Humans can 't beat Guilala . What do you mean ? Wait a minute ! Hello ? Boss , I 'm busy . I 'll call back ! What do you think , everyone ? It 's wonderful , President Pietro . Commander Narumi , mobilize all your forces and have them prepare at once . I understand , but are you quite sure ? The decision is final . The G8 Guilala Task Force is resolute . Understood . You failed once . The initiative is no longer yours . We 'll execute the plan with all our might . G8 Space Monster Task Force HQ Spirit of Rome - Strategic HQ Be thorough about it . Roger . All units stand by in position . Section A , construction completed . How about Second Unit ? Section B , construction completed . Good . Commander ! The president insisted on observing from the front lines . Major Takamine , update our new commander-in-chief . Yes , sir . Every facet of the Spirit of Rome Strategy is now ready . Thank you , thank you . Students of Imperial Roman history know that brilliant victory awaits when the commander is on the front line . I stiffen with pride at the superb morale of your men . I stand to fight alongside you . Our only enemy is Guilala . The Spirit of Rome will be your doom ! Victory is ours ! Commence attack ! Guilala is in my sights . Launch heat-seeking missile . Fire ! Heat-seeking missile away . Guilala 's following the missile as planned ! The missile will lead it to where it 'll fall into a hole that was dug ! Just a little farther ! Just a little farther ! Go ! Go ! It fell in ! Hooray ! Hooray ! Hooray ! We did it ! We got Guilala ! We finally got Guilala ! It 's a success ! Did you get it ? Perfectly . We did it ! Please interpret this . Let 's toast our success with fine Italian wine . Look at that ! It 's Guilala ! It 's still alive ! Guilala 's climbing out ! Move out ! It 's looking this way ! It 's easy to just stand there and talk . You insensitive , bone-headed Yank ! Mr. Burger , stop this ! We 're fighting Guilala here ! Guilala ... Hey . Long time no see , Mr. President . My young successor Ibe is under the weather , so I 'm taking the reins again . I 'm sure if we put our eight heads together , we can finally get rid of Guilala . It 's so delicious ! It 's the best I 've ever had ! I wish I 'd brought my family ! Nonsense . Japan has wonderful cuisine . This place has good food , but there must also be many others . You 're right , of course . What was that about ? I ate too quickly ... It got stuck in my throat . You are so beautiful , Nami . A mysterious jewel of the Orient . You are a smooth talker , Monsieur Sorkozy . But what if your new bride heard you ? Please , Nami , don 't ... I 'd be a disgrace to Frenchmen everywhere if I didn 't try to woo you . Really ... Nami , my dear Nami ... You 're my Arc de Triomphe . I 'm your Eiffel Tower . My tower so wants to enter your arch . What about Guilala ? Don 't bother it , it won 't bother us . So , fancy a drink up in my room ? Leave us alone . The operation isn 't over yet , Monsieur Sorkozy . We 'll escort you back . Say what ! Unhand me ! I 'll be back , Nami ! I promise ! I love you ! Spirit of Rome - Strategic HQ Polonium 210 Poisoning Plan No need for a large-scale operation . I hold the ultimate poison created by the might of Russian science . Polonium 210 ... With this , we can kill any living creature in a mere matter of seconds . Well , look at it our way . It 's not very wise for a democratic nation to shelter a fugitive from a socialist one . It 's rather out of keeping with the spirit of international cooperation . Am I right ? In my opinion , this monster Guilala will provide empirical proof to everyone of the profound nature of Russian justice . Kill it . It worked ! It worked ! Yes , sir ! Mission accomplished . As you can see , Guilala is down ! This could finally be a breakthrough ! What did they do ? I don 't know ... You see , everyone ... It 's best to beware gifts sent from Russia ... Contact Dr. Sano for advice about disposing of its body . Yes , sir . Guilala 's just sleeping . The Russian poison kills all living things except Guilala . These world leaders are useless ! This is a major advance . Even if Polonium 210 only served to put Guilala to sleep , it 's the first time we 've halted it . It 's not failure , it 's progress . Excuse me , sir ! A German transport plane over Okhotsk is requesting permission to land . Yes , I sent for it . Cleaning up the mess Pucchin leaves is a job Germany is used to doing . Polonium 210 Poisoning Plan Dublin VX VIII Poison Gas Plan Mr. Shimaoka , what 're those ? Aren 't those gas masks ? Gas masks ? Please evacuate ! Anyone within a 5 km radius is in danger . Get moving ! Get moving ! What 's going on ? Nothing 's going on ! We need an explanation ! Just hurry and go ! Please , explain this to us ! It seems the soldiers are wearing gas masks . What terrible thing is about to unfold ? They 're silencing the press . Those were gas masks ... It seems martial law is in effect . Hello ? Tokyo Sports Newspaper Company Editorial Office I 'm watching the news ... Gas masks mean they might use chemical weapons . Are you safe there ? Don 't risk your lives just for a scoop , okay ? We 're okay . I need to check on something . I 'll call you later . Hey , Sanpei ! Let 's go to that shrine . What for ? They seemed kind of creepy . Like they resented outsiders ... That 's because they 're hiding something ! To do with Guilala ? Probably . Let 's go ! Everyone , I beg you to reconsider . Aren 't chemical weapons banned under international treaty ? Unless we destroy that monster , there 's no point in talking about a future for Japan . Is that so ... If chemical weapons , then why not nuclear weapons as well ? I misspoke . This is Takamine . This is Takamine . Dublin VX VIII is ready to go . Dublin VX VIII is ready . Mrs. Chancellor ... Deploy . Deploy . Deploy . It 's still alive ! I spied Guilala over there in the field . His belly laugh resounded with joy . Dublin VX VIII Poison Gas Plan Brainwashing Radio Wave Plan It really looks just like Guilala . What 's that one ? Got me ... It 's Take-Majin . It 's you ! What 'd you say ? Take ... Take-Majin . He 'll beat Guilala . Is that a kids show on TV ? " Take-Majin " ? Hey , wait ! You have something to tell us , don 't you ? Right ? What 's going on ? You again ? We want to know about Guilala . Why is it carved up there ? And if I tell you ? I 'm not sure . I just want to learn . I beg you . Please tell me ! Come . This has been passed down from ancient times . It 's Guilala ... What does it say ? " A devil descends from far up in the sky . " " The end of the world . Mountains die . Oceans vanish . " " Rivers full of bones . Of people ... only shadows remain . " The world gets destroyed by Guilala ? " Who will vanquish the devil ? Only the great Take-Majin . " " If it is not stopped ... " That 's where the scroll ends . Guilala came from space . Will Take-Majin appear the same way to fight Guilala ? No . He has been here with us since ancient times . Even before our ancestors chose to live here , he was said to be the guardian deity of Lake Toya . He creates nature and safeguards those who love the natural world . So both that picture and this statue are based on myths drawn from imagination ... Not actual observation like Guilala ? Indeed , Take-Majin may not appear before us . But all people who live here feel him in their hearts . Their belief brings greater clarity than vision . Is something wrong ? Nothing . We 'd better go back now . If we miss the next G8 session , our boss will be really mad . Okay . What a great picture . Why do you like Take-Majin so much , Shinichi ? Because ... I don 't know ! He always runs away ... I feel sorry for the kid . Are you family of his ? No , I 'm just his neighbor . His mother had a terrible time with his birth . She passed away . His dad , Toshio , raised him all alone . It must be about five years ago , now ... Since he was killed in a landslide ... When we found him , it was too late . Just before he died ... Shinichi 's here ! Shinichi ... Lord Take-Majin ... He will protect you ... I know he will ... So he believed his dad . And since that time , he 's adored Take-Majin like his own father . For him , Lord Take-Majin is an irreplaceable hero . So that 's what happened . Lord Take-Majin , please hurry and beat Guilala ! Otherwise , our village will be destroyed ! Dad , ask him to save us . You promised he would . Or did you lie when you said he 'd protect us ? It was the truth . Take-Majin has always protected this lake ... No ... this whole country , since ancient times . And he always will . Sumire ! Where did she go ? Sumire ! One , two ... Neci-Coma ! Then , don 't forget to tilt your head . One , two ... Neci-Coma ! That 's it ! One , two ... Neci-Coma ! What 're you doing ! The next G8 session 's going to start . I 'm not going . Huh ! I 'm staying here to offer a dance for Take-Majin . What ! I want to believe in him too . Did you get hit on the head or something ? Get lost ! Go take pictures of Guilala by yourself ! I can 't do that . What about the article ? That 's not important right now ! Quit this nonsense . Let 's go . I 'm not going ! We don 't have time for this ! Let me go ! Just come on . Ow ! You little brat ! Leave him alone ! He 's just a kid ! What are you doing ? I 'm just ... We told you to leave . Yes , sir , we 're about to . And we 'll never come back . Let 's go . I said I 'm not going ! Shinichi , wait at home . No . That 's an order ! No ! Go home ! I want to believe in the miracle of Lord Take-Majin . He 's no god of yours . You defile the sacred lands he 's protected for generations . He 's too upset now to perform any miracles ! Leave ! Clear off ! Come on , Sumire . I mean it , let 's go ! Sumire ! I won 't ... I won 't leave . Sumire ... We can 't even bring peace to our own cities ! You people of this village are so much better ! You respect nature . You help each other ... You never lose a sense of gratitude in your god ! Please , let me dance with you . Down in the lake , deep in the woods ... Sumire ...

Here it comes ! Quick ! Hurry ! Guilala 's psyche was destroyed , but that 's it ! It 's still alive ... and on a rampage ! It 's more ferocious than before ! Please , help us ... Major Takamine , respond . Major Takamine ! Does that mean it 's going to run amok forever ? What the hell did you do ? It 's not solely a question of losing face . It 's a question of what to do now ! Your entire country is in peril ! I told you so . It seems our only choice is to use a nuclear weapon . Sir , what are you saying ? Esteemed colleagues , your strategies have failed . Now it 's my turn . My Potaedong 55 missile will take out Guilala . Potaedong ? For years , I 've wanted to hijack this summit . I stole Prime Minister Oizumi 's identity data when he visited my country . These interpreters are all from my Pleasure Brigade ! When the missile hits , this place will be irradiated too . The new Potaedong 55 has a limited warhead that only destroys within a 2 km radius . We 're easily safe here . The UN inspection was a joke . The heads of the G8 are my hostages . As for Guilala ... My Potaedong 55 will pulverize him ! My time as King of the World has finally arrived ! Down in the lake , deep in the woods , birds cry out , stars shine down .

Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Bless us with your miracle . You were fantastic , Nami . There 's something I need to tell you . What ? Don 't you worry about my recent marriage . The truth is , I 'm not Japanese . I 'm from the North . Say what ! I can 't keep it secret any longer . I was part of the Supreme Commander 's plan to take over the summit . He 's disguised himself as former Prime Minister Oizumi and plans to take them all hostage . Why didn 't you tell me sooner ! Sorry , but I must sacrifice you for my world domination . Open the missile launch gate ! Northern Country Missile Base Fourth gate open , fourth gate open . One minute until launch ! Soon the entire world will bow before me . Hey , check this out ! No , sucks to be you . I anticipated this . Uh oh , this is the real switch ! What ? All right , let 's go ! Down in the lake , deep in the woods , birds cry out , stars shine down . After an eternity , he endured so long to stand before us . The warrior of the ancients , Take-Majin . Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma !

Stop the festivities and get out of here . A nuclear missile is on its way ! A missile ? Hurry up ! Wait ! Lord Take-Majin ... He 's about to work a miracle ! Take-Majin ? No ! Quick ! Come on , hurry . What gives ! Wait ! Let me go ! Hey ! Let me go ! Hurry ! Dr. Sano ! Is there really going to be a nuclear strike on Guilala ? This jerk pushed the switch ! We 're screwed ... It 's a limited warhead . The damage should be slight . That 's not the point ! Because of your various attempts so far , Guilala 's spores have re-energized to the same level as when it was created ! If it 's hit with a puny warhead like that , its spores will be scattered worldwide , producing thousands ... no , billions of Guilalas everywhere ! Earth will be covered with them ... Lord Take-Majin ! Careful ! Sumire ! Lord Take-Majin ! Sumire ! What do we do ? Dear Lord , I promise to stop fooling around ! It 's Lord Take-Majin ! Lord Take-Majin ! Lord Take-Majin ! Ow , that hurts ! That hurts ! That 's better ... Take-Majin ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! Lord Take-Majin ! Take-Majin ! Who 're you ? What 's your deal ? Quit messing around . Lord Take-Majin , please kill Guilala ! Go for it , Take-Majin ! What the hell ! Keep fighting ! You can do it ! Ow ! Hot ! Hot ! You gotta be kidding me . You 'll pay for that ! Yeah , get ' em ! Now 's your chance ! Take this ! And this ! That 's right ! Take ' em out ! Oh , ow ! That does it . Keep it up ! Come on ! Lord Take-Majin ! Lord Take-Majin ! Chew on this ! Neci-Coma ! Neci-Coma ! He did it ! I knew Take-Majin would win ! Sumire , this is a great scoop ! Guilala vs. Take-Majin . It 's a slam dunk ! We did it ! He 's gone ! Damn it . Find him , at once . Yes , sir ! You are indeed correct . I 'm all better now , and determined to do my duty to my utmost ability . I fancy a dip in a hot spring first . I hear Japanese hot springs are good for the skin . Thank you , Lord Take-Majin . The end That light from the stars overhead took years to reach this place . Nobody knows what the future will be like when the newest light gets here in millions of years . We don 't need to know if those stars shining in the sky even still exist ... It 's like that . Yeah . Just like the big bang , I imagine us someday on an extraterrestrial asteroid . All those stars in the sky 'll shine down for you too . Mathematics : sine , cosine , tangent . So I guess there 's no stopping unmeasurable romance . We 'll get beyond happiness and sadness , over the rainbow . Perspective even the moon ignores at night . Hey , I 'm sure these feelings 'll reach you . Now come on , put your hands in the night sky . Hooray ! We don 't need to know if those stars shining in the sky even still exist , but I 'll soar faster than light , through time itself , because I love you .

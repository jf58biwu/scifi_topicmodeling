 - What 's happening with Ted ? - Heart rate 's spiking to 190 . B.P. , 230 over 110 . - Heart attack ? - Not yet . But I can get Evram to run a scan and - No . We handle this without him . Excuse me , but it 's my responsibility to make sure that - Stand down , Doctor . This is ours . Ted ? Are you there ? Come in , Ted . Switch to comm 4 . He 's not answering . I 've always believed that doors are meant to be opened . That 's why they have hinges and knobs . You put up a barrier , and somebody 's gonna walk through it . That 's human nature to want to know what 's on the other side ... and to ignore the obvious catch - doors are there for a reason . Yo . I 'll be done in a sec if you want to run . Ted ? Ted ? Admit it . It 's a breakfast burger from Momo 's . - I can smell the bacon . - Jen , I feel fine . - They 're monitoring me . - Babe , you 're sick . They 've got you on thinners , for God 's sakes . So , what are you doing there ? You working on the rabbit embryos ? You 're changing the subject . Answer the question . It 's a special project for me and you , okay ? It 's a surprise . How 's Ted doing ? He settling in ? Yeah , he 's fine . So far , we 're on course . No speeding tickets . He 's not you , Rollie . I know . But he left a wife and kid back here . There 's a lot being thrown at him right now . - The crew should go easy . - Roger that . Just ... look out for him , will you ? Of course I will . - You were in pod 4 ? - I was on Mars , Eve . Mars ! - I was there . - Well , you 're stable now . You 're gonna be fine . - Does it do this ? - When it 's trying to tell you something . - Has it happened to you ? - Just me ... and one other person . Ted , I have wanted to tell you everything . You have no idea how hard it 's been . - You are my wife ! - And I was I.S.O. Before that . Ted , this wasn 't my call . You have to believe me . I need you to go back . Go back ? Uh , this isn 't about us . It 's trying to communicate with you . It 's chosen you , just like it chose me . Okay . Form 24 for today . That is astro speak for " daily schedule " ... my fifth graders from Burnaby , British Columbia . Zoe and Paula , you will run the lander through guidance , navigation and control . - Jen ? - Uh , ongoing fertility experiments . - Phosphor relation in microgravity . - Hmm . - Sperm move faster up here , kids . - Oh ! And you , Donner ? Uh , bus rundown and find the leak in the Venus suit . Eso es muy importante . Up here , safety comes first . Evram , status on psych evals ? Door is wide open . Any takers ? Dr. Mintz is our doctor and resident psychiatrist . Life on Antares is a big adjustment . So it 's especially important that we share . Steven , you 'll continue your proton velocity report . Right afterJell-O shots and origami . And I 'll be on the flight deck with Ted . - If we can find Ted . - I think he 's in the shower . He 'll be down . Paula , you okay ? I 'm sorry . - G-sickness . - Whoa ! - Hello ! - Space cookies on the loose . Thus concluding the morning meal . Nice of you to join us . - You got it too ? - I 'm fine . Rollie asked me to look out for you . He sensed you might need an ear . - That 's very big of him . - It 's a commander thing . A friend thing . Or whatever . I 'm here if you need me . Six years is a long time . Is she sure she wants to open that door ? Pilots read ? - And " biologist " is a fancy name for " gardener . " - Oh . I was splicing genes while you were still playing with dolls , friend . - Well , I still play with dolls . - Is that so ? Hey . Beautiful day . - Oh , it 's gonna rain . - Well , rain 's nature 's way of wiping the slate clean . And a leading cause of mold , flooding - And pessimistic blonde ASCANs . - Look , I don 't know why we can 't just be - - What ? - Well , cordial . - Cordial ? Yeah . You know , maybe - maybe more than cordial . Cordial 's as far as I go . Any particular reason for that ? Aren 't you the guy with the " I don 't date astronauts " rule ? Yeah . I mean , technically . I mean , why flirt with someone ... who technically you can 't even ask out for dinner ? - Uh - - It 's a rule worth keeping , Donner . And it 's my rule too . All right . They 're called HALOs , like what angels wear . Stupid acronym . " HALO " ? Hormone Activated Libido Oppressors . First used in prison systems to curb the appetites of sexual offenders . We 're using them now for extended missions . Which we 'd want to do because - Sexual urges destabilize the coworker bond , causing lapses in judgment . In other words , relationships are toxic . - You can have sex without a relationship . - We 'd prefer you had neither . To that end , your assignment ... is to wear your HALOs for a period of 24 hours ... to get a sense ofhow they 'll funct - - Behind the ear , Mr. Fassenwelder . - That 's " Wassenfelder . " - Wanna switch with me ? Give me yours . - No . Thousands of years of reproductive evolution ... wiped out with a tiny green dot . How do we know what they put into these things ? Hormone weirdness can affect the fetus . Will you stop with the fetus ? Zoe , it 's not an option . You can 't have a baby right now . Especially not Maddux Donner 's . Side effects are rare , so they say . While we believe it 's a safer alternative to the messy side of cohabitation ... as with all medical procedures , I must advise you of its detractors . That was funny . Yeah . Oh , it 's funny . But I think this is affecting me . Open . It 's talking to her again . - May I help you , sir ? - Yes . I 'm Ajay Sharma . I 'm the flight engineer - former flight engineer of the Antares . - You might recognize me . - Yes , sir . Yes . Uh , my credential seems not to be working . Please have a seat , sir , and I 'll call in and see what I can do . - I 'm sure it 'll be fine . If you 'd just let me in - - Please have a seat , sir . Yo , Paula Puke . Queen of the upchuck . Mistress of heave . When my door is closed ... that means I have intentionally put up a barrier for my privacy . - And ? - And ... if you wish to move through that barrier , you would need to ask for my permission . " Yes " is not permission . " Who is it ? " is not permission . The only thing that will give you permission to enter are the words ... " Please , come in . " But you , Steven , you are only going to get as far as " Who is it ? " Because after I hear your name , I am bolting the door . - So you want me to leave ? - Get out . Get out ! Okay . So Paula 's not doing the G.N.C. With you ? No . Last thing we need is vomit in the Venus lander . Yeah . The o-deck 's never gonna smell the same . Who 's her alt ? You know damn well who the alt is . S.T.D. " Sexy , Tragic Donner . " A.K.A. " the clap . ' " I 'm never gonna shake this guy , am I ? Uh , not for the next six years , no . You know , there 's this line you cross with men . You can be colleagues . Then friends . Then lovers . But ... can you go back ? I mean , does that line work in reverse ? - Emotional rewind ? I don 't know . - Yes , you do . I mean , you and I are both rewound completely . We 've both moved on . Ted , Donner-We 're done . - HALO secure ? - HALO secure . Hey , Ted . You all right ? You , uh , seem a little off today . - Yeah , maybe a little . - Huh . Well , I 'm gonna head back to the lander bay for the G.N.C. Paula 's still G-sick . - Right , you 're the alt . - Yeah . Listen . There 's gonna be a lot ofback and forth today with Control . I might need you there for it . Well , if I 'm not there , Nadia will be . Well , I 'd rather have - You sure you 're all right ? Maybe just a little déjà vu , that 's all . This is a new mission , Ted . It 's not Mars . Roger that . You know , they 're so concerned about our libidos . What about the halos for everything else ? Dude , this thing might 've worked when I was in ninth grade , maybe . - HALO versus the machine , right ? - What can I say ? There 's a whole lotta Ted . It 's really itchy . It - I feel like it 's red . Is it red ? I don 't need chemical castration to do my job . - Well , the guys do . - Yeah . But they actually think they can beat it . We can put a man on Mars , but we can 't find a way to kill his erection . They have . Trust me . I 've seen the studies on these things . And the only two results are limp and limper . - Have they grown breasts yet ? - No . They think they can beat the HALO . - A male 's sexual weakness is second only to his stupidity . - Meaning ? I think we can make some money on this . The rules are simple . If one of you big , strong astronauts can overcome the HALO - - Rise to the occasion . - Pitch a tent . - Then you win . - But if you stay limp , sad and small - - Then we win . - All right . - Who 's the bank ? - That would be me . Cha-ching . Don 't do it . It 's a sucker 's bet . I 've seen the studies . Fifty large on the one-eyed monster . - Fifty , double down . Fifty . There 's another 50 . But we pick the place and time . All right , bring it on . Ante up , boys . Nice . Anyone else ? Any other takers ? Looks like we 're in business . - Good for you , Paula . - Yo , Ajay , spot me . - Come on . Any more takers ? - Gambling brings on many miseries . - Erodes a man 's good name . - Screw that . These babies are calibrated for size . Average astronaut size . - I can win this . - Perhaps . - I would still prefer not to get - - Okay , look . Think of it as a bonding thing . Becoming an astronaut rather than a geek . Geek . You 're a geek . Geek . That 's what everybody is saying . You 're a geek . This is against my better judgment . We 're in . - All right . - Is it cool ? - Don 't touch me like that . - Sorry . Yeah , good . Copy that , Crossbow . Rate gyro sensor is engaged . - Moving on to page seven . - Roger that . Page seven . - Aligning sequencer engaged . - I could 've done that . - I 'm the pilot . - Mmm , the alternate pilot . Yeah , that 's the pilot for today . DAP activated . Preparing lander for tertiary landing site . What 's that ? It 's a glitch in the digital autopilot . The landing navigation system 's gone to the tertiary site . The DAP 's automatically calibrated for the primary . Not according to the guidance module . Look . The numbers don 't sync with the ship . If G.N.C. Sends us to a different site on the day , the mission is toast . Forget the mission . You and Paula are toast . Um - All right , might be the trajectory control sensor . - Might be ? - Well , do you want to check it out yourself ? - You 're piloting . - All right . I 'm the alt . - Well , which is why you missed a step . - I don 't think so . Why don 't we just hit reset , Donner , and start from the top ? Control , we 're gonna do a hard reset ... - and go to the top of page seven . - Copy that . Excuse me . Preparing lander for tertiary landing site . Well , it seems the lander has made up its mind . It wants to kill us . - Crossbow , are you seeing something we 're not seeing ? - Something funky , Rollie . The system 's switching us to the third landing site , and the override 's not working . - It shouldn 't be doing that . Not now . - Might be an E.S.P. Microsurge . - You check the D.A.P. Config ? - Affirmative , and we hard reset three times . I 'm gonna switch over to manual , take a system check ... and maybe I can isolate the bug . Uh , hold off on that for now , Donner . - Ted , are you in the loop ? - Negative , Control . I 'm on the flight deck and have been following . Hey , Nadia , you know where he is ? Maybe doing his psych eval with Mintz ? All right , look . We don 't need Ted for this . I can do a manual check from here . Do you have Ajay down there ? He helped design the damn thing . - Hold on a second . - Ajay 's not an option . - Is this Beta screwing with us ? - I don 't know . I don 't think so . - Do you know where Ted is ? - He 's processing . He 's been through a lot . Well , he 's gotta get over it and handle Donner . We can 't have him digging in the lander 's code . Uh , Donner , this is Flight . Listen , we are gonna power down the lander ... let it sit for a day and reboot . That 's your solution ? You 're gonna hit the off switch and pray ? Look , I got a retriever at home with the croup , and I 've been stuck in board meetings all day . - The lander is fine . - Tell that to Zoe and Paula when they 're trying to land it . Powering Crossbow down now . Maybe Paula will have better luck . - Well , I hope so . - You gonna talk to Ted ? Yeah , I got it . Hey . - Where the hell were you ? - I 've been here . We just ran G.N.C. I asked you to be up on the flight deck . - Nadia was there . - Nadia 's not the mission commander . She can 't say jack to Mike Goss . - We 'll talk later . - No , let 's talk about it now . Okay ? I got a serious glitch with this landing sequence . - I think I can find it if they 'd let me go after it . - Then find it . Yeah , well , they shut the lander down . - Ted ? - I 'm sure they had their reasons . What ? I 'm sure they had their reasons , Donner . Let me finish this . Paula , you all right ? Leave me alone ! You got a couple head cases in crew quarters . Get on it . - How 'd it go ? - The landing sequence is screwed up . We rebooted three times , then they finally shut us down . - Mmm . Now , tell me how it went . - Fine . - That 's it ? Fine ? - That 's it . It was professional and cordial . - Cordial ? - In a very professional way . - Huh . Well , excellent . - You don 't believe me . I believe you , and I 'm proud of you . - Good . - Despite the fact you 're wearing two halos . She 's most agile . Four-letter word for " manhood ' " ? That 'd be W-A-S-S . You 've overcome the mighty HALO ? Feelin ' a twinge . Give me a little girl-on-Wass action , and that cash is mine . The hormone inhibitor kicked in about an hour ago ... working its way from the amygdala region of his brain down into his bloodstream . So it looks like big Ted 's little Ted ! Uh , I 'm gonna take this thing off . - No , you don 't ! Not with my money , you 're not . Come on , focus . - All right . Kiki , listen . This is like a race , okay ? I want you to think of it like a long , hard race . - I 'm leaving . - No , no , no , no , no . No way . No way . Come on . We 're making a point here . All right ? This whole HALO thing , it 's about evening the field . It 's about gender neutralizing . If they can hack it , so can we . Don 't you get it ? This isn 'tjust a stupid bet . This - - This is war . - It 's pathetic . Fine . Think of it as cultural then . It 's a voyage to an unknown planet . Planet Exploitation . Tell me these women go home feeling a sense of pride . They 're being humiliated . So it 's less humiliating to put on the wounded good girl act ... - so a man will pay attention ? - Excuse me ? Come on . I see the way you look at Donner , hoping he 'll glance over here . If you want him , go . - Get him . - You are sadly mistaken . Yeah , the last thing she needs is to get involved ... with Captain Limp and the Noodle Gang . - Then you won 't mind if I switch teams for a while ? - What ? - You 're gonna go help them beat us ? - No . I just like getting naked . Oh , my God . Is she even human ? Oh , sweet mama ! Thank you ! - She 's not interested in you , Steven . - Don 't be such a tight-ass . Nadia ! Nadia ! - This is " game over ' " right here . - Yeah , Nadia . Go , girl . Don 't go for it . Don 't do it . Don 't do it . Don 't do it . What is this , a setup ? Is that a setup ? - Can I go now ? - Hell , yes . All right . - Are you gonna be okay ? - No . Yes ! I 'm fine . Just tired . - Yes . - Go ! Go ! Bye , Zoe . You know what ? L-I surrender . This is too good . - I can 't - I can 't beat this . - Come on , Donner . - Give the young guys a try . Shock them , you know ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! - Ah , come on , Maddux . Maddux ! - In your dreams . Ajay . Respect . We have a winner ! We have a winner ! Oh , yeah ! They just told me you were out here . I 'm sorry . Um , I brought some of the stuff from your locker . Crew suit and - I heard they put you in Research . I was permitted to pick up the keys to my flat and my mail . But my gym card was revoked . Yeah , well , the upside of heart plaque is sanctioned sloth . I haven 't been able to make myself go back in ... to my apartment to unpack my boxes . When I left , when I packed them ... I was an astronaut . - You 're still an astronaut , Ajay . - No . I 'm in Research now . You know , I never realized ... how much I treasured the connection to this place ... the people ... that sense of belonging . Nice night . It 's , uh - I just felt a drop . Ever the pessimist . - Not much back there to cheer me up . - Nah . Nobody ever got smart from drinkin ' . You know , F.Y.I. , this bus only comes here on the hour after 10 : 00 . Yeah . I can 't afford to take cabs . Ah . I used to play ball when I was a kid . Yeah , I used to get up every morning at 6 : 00 to go throw with my dad . I was gonna be the greatest pitcher Cedar Rapids Little League ever saw . And were you ? I fell off a jungle gym and broke my arm three days before the tryouts . Little League had a rule . No broken bones , no exceptions . But I went anyway 'cause I figured that , uh ... they 'd look , see past the cast and , you know , see what really mattered - that I had heart ... I wanted to play . Did they let you try out ? No . I had a broken arm . But , uh - But I showed up . So your point is rules are rules , no exceptions . That doesn 't mean I can 't take you out to dinner . You know , I mean as colleagues or something . Actually , Donner , I think it does . Ajay , you 're a stud , baby . Swipe it . Collect it . Learn to respect it . - Show me the money , honey . - He did it . He got one . What happened to " limp and limper " ? Hey , the test studies didn 't have Nadia giving lap dances . I barely looked at him . They say science is the great leveler . There 's no decency . There 's no ethics . Oh ! Yo , Paula Puke ! I think maybe it 's a good time to go home . - Roger that , because I am broke . - You wanna share a cab ? - Only if you 're buying . - I , actually - I wanted to ask you some questions about your last paper . You know , " Functional Genomics : The N2 Fixings of " " Filamentous Cyanobacteria " ? - That one . - You read that ? - Yeah , I did . It was fascinating stuff . Really ? I mean , because - I mean , nobody - nobody read that . Well , I also know you like pie . Cafeteria gossip . - Mmm . - And I know a great place on the way . - Sure . Yeah . Why not ? - Jen , Rol . Uh , we 're moving the party over to Major Tom 's . And the guys are buying . - Oh . - Uh , you know what , man ? It 's an early day tomorrow . - Oh , come on ! - Are you sure ? - What , you want to go ? - Well , if the boys are buying , yeah . You know what ? I am gonna make sure Paula gets home . All right . - Okay . - Let 's go . - All right . - Bye . Something 's clearly wrong with him . The whole crew knows it . I mean , he 's not talking to Mintz . Donner can 't get through to him . And if Donner can 't - I guess Rollie 's right . It 's gonna fall to me . He 's withdrawn . He 's introspective . It 's not unusual when confronting the universe . - Physically , he 's fine . - And Paula ? She 's in her quarters . You know , she 's not drinking enough . I 'm pushing liquids . Paradoxically , I wish I were drinking more . Are you wearing your medication patch ? My withdrawal symptoms are under control , Doctor . - " Je manque mais toi . " - I miss you too . It 's a lonely planet without you . Yeah , well , we always face the unknown alone . - The astronauts ' genome analysis . - Thank you . It 's a virtual impossibility that all eight of the Antares crew ... have the same euchromatic and heteromatic gene variations . - What are you suggesting ? - I 'm not suggesting anything . The crew 's physiology 's changing , lining up like points on a grid ! I know something up there is causing this ... caused the plaque that grounded Rollie and Ajay ... is probably causing the crisis with Ted right now . Something 's happening , and I need to know why . There 'll be no going back , Claire . Once you open this door , you can 't close it . Do you understand ? Analyze the genome of this . My name is not Paula Puke . My name is Paula Morales . And Paula Morales does not get G-sickness . Paula Morales will pilot the Venus lander . Paula Puke doing her variation of the dry heave in B-flat minor . They should build these things with thicker walls . - Paula ? - Go away ! I just need to sleep . Oh . Don 't tell me you have it too . No , I 'm fine . I just need to walk . Is it me , or is everybody on this ship crazy ? You can see the moons ofJupiter . Ganymede , Europa , Callisto . Never gets old . - Yeah , not on day four . - Yeah . Around the same time congestion , backache and insomnia begin to work their magic . - Mmm . Loss of appetite and ... nausea . - Mmm . And don 't forget about the mental jujitsu . Anxiety , excessive fear of danger . My favorite - paranoia . They 're all normal things , Ted . I mean , they 're expected . Just the way to get through all of this is to open up to the rest of us . You don 't have to go through this alone . I 'm afraid I do , Jen . Donner ? - Are you hearin 'this too ? - Yeah . Something 's running . It 's the lander . It 's supposed to be dark for 24 hours before reboot . They 're reprogramming it without us . You 're all the same . You 're one of them . Yes . It 's happening to me too . What 's going on ? Water ! Steven ! Not playing that game . I got my boundaries , baby . - Remember those ? - Please . Ted . Come on . Open up . All right . So Mission Control reprogrammed the lander last night without bothering to tell us . We 're gonna be looking at brand-new code . You know , I don 't know what your problem is right now , but , uh ... you know , if I can 't help you with - You pull an all-nighter ? I got inspired . You know , bunny stuff . Thank you . Ted 's in his quarters , and he won 't come out . Mmm . Yeah , I talked to him last night . You talked to Ted ? Rollie asked me to ... be a friend . - Well , he is going through a lot . - So how 'd it go ? Well , if he 's hiding out in his room , apparently not that well . That wasn 't the question . Fine . I mean , it went fine . It was professional and cordial . Which is why you 're wearing two halos . I hear we 're going to have to adjust your dosage , Mr. Sharma . Um , you should be aware that that has caused me itching ... which has led to a great deal of itching . HALOs are useless . Wasted resources . - And why is that , Doc ? - It 's never just about the sex . It starts that way . It 's always more . - Oh . Sorry . - Oh , my - Hey , pilot . Hey , gardener . Did 5k . That 's not bad for a hangover . - 5k ? - Yeah . Well , I got 2k and a nap in the park . Yeah . Um - So listen . Look , about last night , I did have a little bit to drink . Don 't sweat it . Coworker immunity . You didn 't say what I didn 't hear . - Professional courtesy ? - Exactly . - So we 'll stick to the rule ? - The rule . It 's what we want , right ? Right . All right , well , I , uh - I should probably - Sure . You should . All right . How 's Ted this morning ? - Where is he ? - In his quarters . He won 't come out . Hey , Rollie . Is something wrong ? You tell me , buddy . People are concerned . So is that what I 'm feeling ? Last thing you want 's a shaky crew . - I 'm fine . - You 're hiding in your quarters . Don 't sling that bull at me . The Antares mission was my mission ... and it 's my moral responsibility to make sure my replacement 's doing me proud . So what 's really going on , Ted ? You feeling alone up there ? You scared about what you 're learning ? Or maybe this is about betrayal ... being hurt by the one person you thought you could trust . Well , you want to know how to deal with that ? I 'll tell you , bro . You suck it up . And if you 're lucky , stupid damn lucky , one day that wound stops bleeding . You 'll always know it 's there , but you won 't always have to look at it . Not always . Not every day . And you 'll consider yourself blessed . So get your act together , Ted . There are seven other people up there depending on you , and one of them is my wife . My wife ! Take care of her . The lander 's back online . Mission Control won 't be pulling that crap again . - That 's good to hear . - When 's the last time you checked on Paula ? Couple hours ago . She wasn 't letting anyone into her bay . She 's not the doctor , Mintz . I want her up and running ... and on that lander tomorrow for the G.N.C. - Who woke him up ? - Don 't know . Sure kicked our asses though . It 's true that some doors are better left unopened . But you usually don 't realize it until you 're on the other side . Nice and easy . I 've killed men for less . We all make mistakes . It comes with the territory . Still no reason to live your life in one room . - Are you sure you 're okay ? - I 'm going in . I love you . Doors we choose to open determine the path of our lives ... be they brave ... angry ... foolish ... painful . We 're defined by what we do ... by where we go . And you can 't go anywhere ... without opening the door .

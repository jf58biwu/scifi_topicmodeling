Sheriff . I haven 't seen you on this side of Harborford for quite a while . I kind of preferred it that way . I was just visiting . Uh-huh . Haven 't you disappointed her enough for one lifetime ? You know , Scotty , I take a personal interest in my niece 's well-being , and you of all people should know how important family is . Is there something I can do for you ? Go home , son . [ Woman ] Scott . Jess . Two years . Wow . Yeah , I heard you were in town . My parents bought a new boat in California , sailing it back for their 25th anniversary , and I 'm the house-sitter .

Well ... Yeah ... Bye . Bye . Scott- - Yeah ? Look , it 's freezing out . Do you want something hot before you go ? You sure ? Yes , I 'm sure . [ Scott ] Deja vu . My mom keeps it untouched . It 's weird . I can 't believe you 're still in Harborford . You always wanted to leave so bad . Rub it in . I was all set to do the big move , and then my dad got sick- - No way ! Didn 't I make you that bracelet ? Of course . - It 's so bad . It 's cute . [ engines running ] [ slithering ] What the hell ? [ stomach rumbles ] How many summer days did we totally waste up here ? We were awful . I was a bad influence . Scott , I 'm sorry I stopped calling , My parents , and then school . - It 's all right . Don 't worry about it . I understand . I do , and your parents were right . How was it for you ? [ sighs ] Not that bad . Eight months , three squares a day . More than I could count on at home most of the time , right ? Yeah . Anyway , it 's ancient history now . Really cleaned up . Honest , you 'd hardly recognize me . Yeah , right . I 'm in college , here at Sherwood , on the hockey team , until the end of the semester at least . Then I 'm out of here . What do you mean ? I 'm leaving this place . For good . - Where are you going ? I don 't know . California , maybe . Just gotta go . Are you seeing anybody ? No . Wow , what 's her name ? Lydia . It 's nothing serious . Why not ? Half the time , I 'm crazy about her . Half the time , I just want to kill her . How about you ? - Well , no one in particular . I 'd better get going . Yeah , we hit the ice in an hour . You should come by , though . We 'll grab a coffee and a claw over at Fred 's later . Well , won 't you be seeing Lydia tonight ? It 's girls ' night , and she 's going out . Okay .

Will you excuse us for a moment ? Lydia ... Truth , huh ? Tell me who this belongs to . Okay . I didn 't want to tell you about him . He 's been obsessed with me since last year . I mean , he showed up tonight , and I tried to talk to him , but he got weird , so I left . That 's all . Come on . I 'm sorry . Will you ever forgive me , kind sir ? Lydia , come on . You 're going to make me pay for this , aren 't you ? [ hiccups ] [ laughs ] Remember , we 're going out tonight . What ? - I 'll be ready by 8 . I guess I must have- - Forgotten , yeah .

Look , I am . This isn 't what you think . Then what is it ? You should go home . Your uncle , he 's going to be looking for me . I 'll get you some of my dad 's things to wear . [ Scott ] Thanks . In the morning- - you need to go . [ sniffles ] [ footsteps ] [ sobbing ] She was one of my best friends . I 'm very sorry . Thank you . Sam . You 're sure it was Scott Miller they saw running out of here ? [ Sam vomits ] [ phone rings ] Hello ? [ Sheriff Durst ] Jess ? [ Jesse ] Uncle Ty . Is everything okay ? I 'm fine . Have you seen Scotty Miller tonight ? No , I haven 't seen him since this afternoon . [ Jesse ] Why , what happened ? Nothing , sweetheart . You just go back to sleep . [ beep ] [ mumbling ] [ footsteps ] [ blood seeping ] [ screaming ] Scott . - Oh , thank God . What 's the matter with you ? It 's a nightmare . [ Scott ] Look , Jesse . Jesse . Look , all that matters is you 're okay . I mean , if anything happened to you , I- - [ siren wailing ] [ TV reporter ] And another puzzling death in Harborford . The victim has been identified as Lydia Mason , a student at Sherwood College in Harborford . Mason 's attacker is as of yet unidentified . Local sheriff Ty Durst was tight-lipped at the scene this morning . The investigation is underway . We have a few eyewitnesses and a suspect . And that 's all I 've got to say . That 's all I 've- - Anything else ? [ Sheriff Durst ] No , I can 't . Yeah , I 'll hold . Come on . Step aside . Come on . Jess , I know how this looks . Were you there ? - I was . You 've got to let me explain , though . [ Jesse ] I saw him , the fireman at the arena . Hi , this is Jesse Jarrett . I 'd like to talk to Sheriff Durst right away , please . I didn 't hurt her . She just disintegrated in front of me . Her eyes were almost black , full of blood . You need help . She must have caught it from him . [ TV chatter continues ] It could be some kind of disease or a poison . Look , I 'm going to figure this out . I just need some time . - Please hurry . [ Scott ] Okay , Jesse , you know me better than anyone . If I had done this thing , would I still be here ? [ Sheriff Durst ] Hello ? Ty ? Jesse ? I 'm at your front door . Jesse , you all right ? I 'm fine . Good , good . You see the news ? Scotty Miller 's in serious trouble , sweetheart . Do you know where he is ? Jess ? You feeling okay ? Scott- - - I know , I know . I know , sweetheart . Just ... relax , okay ? Just hold on . [ door closes ] Let 's go sit down , sweetheart . Okay ? [ horns honking ] [ horn honks ] Sweetheart , I don 't think you understand the level of depravity in the Miller family . Now , your great-uncle Cyrus , he busted the first Miller bootlegging operation right off of this coast . Scott 's old man Lucky ? Well , he 's just as bad . And now ... looks like Scott 's the worst of the bunch . I can 't believe you lied to me , Jesse . You 're wrong about him . I know Scott . Wrong ? That kid 's taken this whole town for a ride , made a damn mockery out of me ! [ sighs ] Jesse . [ Sheriff Durst sighs ] Scott 's conviction two years ago , it was his old man moving the hot car parts we found on the property . It was going to be his third count , and he was looking at 30 years guaranteed . But presto . Scott confesses , takes the fall for his old man . Scott went to prison in his dad 's place ? You see what I 'm saying , sweetheart ? They 're all the same trash . [ phone vibrates ] Yeah ? Well , what kind of situation ? Just slow down . What ? Yeah , okay . I 'll be right there . [ beeps ] We 're not done . Where 'd he go ? [ running , screaming ] What the- - Hey ! [ screaming ] Okay . Hold it right there ! I said stop ! Stay back ! I 'm warning you ! Sam , go get an ambulance . What the hell 's happening in this town ? [ fire alarm rings ] [ motorcycle starts ] [ sirens wailing ] [ sirens fade ] [ door closes ] The church fire was the last mission he was on . [ phone rings ] [ phone rings ] Yo . No shit . What channel ? This adds to the bizarre occurrences taking place this week in Harborford . That must be the psycho that killed Josh . [ Reporter ] ... that is attacking the people of Harborford . Sheriff Durst has given us very little information to go on . He has told us that he has a suspect in mind . He has not , as of yet , given us a name nor description of the suspect , which only adds to the feeling of fear in the community . That 's it , dude . I am done for the day . Mom , he shouldn 't have called you . No , Scott 's not here right now . [ TV reporter talks ] He was . Look- - You don 't know that . No , stay there . [ sighs ] Okay . I 'll call you later . # You climbed inside a big balloon # # And I watched you wave goodbye # # You said it 'd only be awhile # Half the time , I just want to kill her . - # It seemed # # like such a lie # - Your uncle , he 's going to be looking for me . # I believe # - I mean , if anything # It now # - happened to you , I 'd- - # I believe it now # # Hey , yay , yay , yeah # [ TV reporter ] Late developments regarding the shooting today at Sherwood Mall in Harborford . The dead man has been identified as Mr. Darrell Johanson , a Harborford roofer . Mr. Johanson went on a rampage earlier today , attacking shoppers in the mall before being gunned down by police . It was horrible . His face was falling off , and his eyes , it was as if they were full of blood . Reporting to you live from Harborford- - Full of blood ? ... this is Susan Fox . [ cell phone rings ] [ beep ] Jesse ? You didn 't run . What ? - You didn 't run . It 's what you 'd always do when we were kids and you got in trouble . You 'd run away , be gone for days . I got pretty close , believe me . I don 't know you got yourself into this , but you 're going to need my help to get out of it . Where are you ? Scott ? You need my help . How do you plan on helping me , Jesse ? [ crunching ] You 'd better keep your distance . - No . It 's not a virus . How do you know ? - It would have spread through town by now . Go . Lydia 's fireman was on a call here . The fireman got it first . He gave it to Lydia , she gave it to the guy at the mall . If the game was at three , and Lydia died at nine , that 's six hours . What 's that ? Oh ! [ sniffs ] Don 't get too close . Smells like vinegar . [ sniffs ] We have to get down there . [ dripping ] Over there . That 's where the axe was . [ footsteps in water ] [ moving items ] Here . I see something . Careful . [ Jesse ] Okay , here goes . " This vessel bears a corrigia " born of hellfire . Preserve this vessel , sealed from the world- - " I can 't read the rest . It 's dated the 4th of May , 1871 . We 've got a date and a name . I can look through the town 's archives . Maybe there 's something there . We need to find that guy your uncle dusted at the mall . If this " corgeria " thing has moved on , we need to find out who . Come on , huh ? One shot . Clear the frame . Huh ? Come on . I 'm begging you . 20 bucks . I 'll give you 20 bucks . Flatfoot ! Yeah . You have a nice day , too , sir . [ Jesse ] Okay . [ engine starts ] The last person with the guy from the mall was his ambulance technician Eddie Pastor . He left his shift early . He 's a boarder , and they say that we can find him at one of the skate parks . Can I have the chips ? Whoa ! You want these chips ? Not so fast . You 're the guy that can do the backside air , right ? I can 't right now . [ stomach growls ] Hungry . The backside air first . [ stomach growls ] Okay , we 're back at the church . I 'll meet you here after . Jesse . - Yeah ? Thanks . For what ? Believing me . [ laughs ] No psychotic killer could make anything this goofy . " Edward Norberg , a Harborford native " and a respected silversmith , " was struck down by a bolt of lightning " Tuesday night in what many consider to be " an act of divine intervention . The madman was survived by a wife and son . " Hey . Is that- - Is that Eddie ? Yo , we didn 't do this . I didn 't say you did . Is that him ? This jack attacked me , and dropped dead . [ hiccups ] How ? How 'd he attack you ? Listen , you should come with me . I think you might be sick or cursed , maybe . I just told you , we didn 't do this . It 's called the corrigia . Are you deaf , fuck head ? 'Cause I just told you- - You don 't understand . If you don 't get to a doctor now , you might not make it through the night . Come on . [ phone rings ] Come on , Scott . Who is it ? Miss Norberg ? My name is Jesse Jarret . I 'm looking for information on Edward Norberg . I tried calling the listed number . They said it was out of service . - Stay right there . [ coughs ] [ voice on TV ] ... but that 's not to say that people haven 't put their own quarantine in effect . People are staying in their houses . People aren 't going to work . Children aren 't going to school . They have really isolated themselves in hopes of- - Took you long enough . Just the man I 've been looking for . Ty , same as the others . I 've been warning them for years . Who are you with ? FBI ? CIA ? - Uh- - Mrs. Norberg- - Show me your identification . Oh . Miss Norberg- - - No one ever listened , but now they will . Now they will . Could you tell me anything about what happened in 1871 ? The scourge , dear . La corrigia . [ coughs ] My great-grandfather , Edward , was falsely blamed for the deaths in 1871 . He devoted his whole life to clearing his name . His search took him around the world . But Edward died , hit by lightning . No one got it out of them in time . But they had to explain the murders away , so he was reported dead , whisked out of the country , and warned never to return . Who is they ? They . When he died , all his possessions were sent here from the Far East . Everything is in the coach house . It 's all there . Go ahead . I 'm telling you , you gotta find the skater girl . She 's next . How does she tie in with Lydia , Dennis , and the fireman ? I never met her before tonight . I already told you . What about the freak at the mall ? What 's he got to do with this ? You 're on the wrong track . - How are you killing these people , boy ? I 'm not ! What is it ? Some kind of freaking chemical agent or whatnot ? Who 'd you buy it from ? Just listen . - You were placed at both murder sites . The fireman and your girl had been getting it on for months , so you had plenty of motive . And last but not least , right there . So how ' bout a confession so you have something , however futile , going for your sorry ass ? Find the girl . Okay . All right , smart ass , we 're gonna do it your way . Sam , take him down to the station . I 'm gonna give the news to the press . Hey , Chris . Let 's go . Hands off , Porky . What the hell are you looking at ? Get used to it , Miller . [ knocking ] That goddamned sheriff arrested some boy for the murders . You 've got to get down there and straighten it out . You 're Lucky Miller 's kid . Yeah . I know your old man . Where is that fother mucker ? Dead , six months . Cancer . - Old Lucky . Dumb shit . Always was a loser . No offense . None taken . Tries to go straight , then croaks . Sorry ass . - What ? He should of known Ty 'd never let him just stop the monthly . Monthly ? Durst ? Everyone in town 's gotta pay the kindly sheriff . Try saying no , and he 'll set you up on some trumped-up charge . That 's what he did to your old man . Are you saying the car parts he found on my dad 's property were- - Planted . You bet . Fortune never smiled on your old man . That 's why they called him Lucky . So listen to this . I 'm minding my own business , grabbing a taco on First , down by the Foundry , and this skinny chick comes up to me . She 's wearing those hip-hop pants . I hate the look . But I see she 's got this slamming rack , so I 'm friendly . I take her for a spin on my bike . She 's got her hands all over me . So I pull over on the 12th street overpass . We 're gonna do it there , on the bridge . She gets to her knees , pulls up my shirt . Next thing I know , this bitch is puking her guts out . I mean her guts . Blood , stomach shit , all over the sidewalk . It was fucked up . When was this ? No , wait , you gotta hear the rest of this . She 's grabbing at me like she 's gonna freaking die , right there . I 'm like , whoa , bitch . But she keeps coming . [ gurgling sound ] So I push her ass away from me , and she goes right over the edge , splat . She 's on the highway and these semis are making mincemeat of this chick . [ gurgling ] It was fucked up . [ hiccups ] Shit , you got something to eat , kid ? Sheriff ! - What 's your problem ? Sheriff Durst ! Hey . Shut the hell up . Stay back- - Sheriff ! What the hell is your problem , Miller ? This guy 's infected . Everybody knows that . - Funny . He 's got it . You gotta let me out of here . Get your hands off me , Miller . Stay away from me . - What the- - Oh , Jesus . Let me out . Shit . Now look what you 've gone and done . Come on , put your hands through the bars . [ screams ] Holy shit . Miller , get this guy off me . Come on , don 't just stand there . [ screams ] [ ripping ] [ hiccups ] What the hell happened here , Miller ? I think I need to kill you , Sheriff . Just calm down , son . [ cocks gun ] Hey , whoa . The hell 's gotten into you ? It 's in you . There 's nothing wrong with me , boy . Put that gun down . - I 'm sorry . You 're no killer , Scotty . You said so yourself . You don 't understand . You 're not gonna shoot anybody . Like father , like son . You pussy . [ clank ] Help me . Miller ! Come on , come on , go . Get the son of a bitch . Got the keys ? Yeah , I 'll drive . I 'll drive . Get in the damn car . I want to know the point as soon as you get there , fellas . What ? - This is yours . Well , that 's nice , Sam . Now go get the damn car ! I want the south end and the north end blocked off . I repeat , the north and south end blocked off . Sam , come on ! Go , go . Christ . [ belches ] What happened back there ? Just drive . [ burp ] All right , we 've barred him in the alley between Bell and Third . I 'll be right there . Take no chances , boys . You see him , shoot to kill . I repeat , take no chances with this guy . [ burp ] Turn this heap around , Sam . Where are those doughnuts ? [ burp ] Ah , yeah . [ burp ] I want the south end blocked off , Sam . Right here . Go , go , go , go , go ! On the ground , Miller . You don 't have time , Sheriff . - He said on the ground . It 's inside him . Can 't you see ? He needs help . Now ! Don 't give me any more reason than I already have , son . How could you ? How could you do it ? Do what ? He was sick , and you knew it . You still blackmailed him . You had to see him suffer , didn 't you ? What 's he talking about , Ty ? You and your daddy thought you could make a fool out of me , didn 't ya ? Ty , what the hell ? Shut up , Sam ! Well , now , it looks like we have a real unpleasant situation here . Fortunately , no one 's gonna miss a murdering delinquent from Harborford . [ Jesse ] Don 't bet on it , Sheriff . Jesse ? I can 't believe you , Uncle Ty . How could you ? [ hiccup ] You are a disgrace . Jesse , you put that Taser down . I 'm not playing with you , girl . I 'm warning you . Sam . You have no idea the shit storm you are now in , young lady . Stop ! - Jesse , relax . Sam , now ! [ electricity crackling ] She has nothing to do with it . I 'm the one you 're after . Shut up ! Oh , my God . [ squealing ] Jesus , Mary- - Sheriff ? Stay away from him . - Down on the ground ! Now ! It 's gonna want to move . Ty ? Buddy ? Shoot it . Shoot it . Stop , Ty , stop ! He 's gone ! Okay , let 's j-jus-just- - just calm down . Holy Jehosaphat . I have never , in my entire life , seen anything that comes close- - [ gunshot ] Is he- - Is the sheriff dead ? Where 'd it come from ? Nobody knows . Well , how do you kill it ? I don 't know . Great . Wait . [ engine starts ] Do it ! Punch it . Oh , no . Aah ! Fire . We need fire . Glove box . Flares . [ screams ] Come here , you . [ screaming ] [ screeching ] [ sirens approaching ] We gotta get you out of here . The doctors that I 've spoken to have confirmed that this is possible . It could be a virus , that a virus could do that to these bodies , mutilate them in a way that is But that 's not to say that that 's what 's for sure this is . This is a grimoire , from 1766 . A what ? It 's a demonologist handbook . The Church spent centuries collecting information from what they thought was demonic activity . These books have everything , from weather portents to demonic possessions and exorcisms . Who would use them ? The practitioners of goetic magic . They were sort of demonic exterminators that the Church kept on staff . This is what Edward Norberg was convinced attacked him . " Corrigia . " Latin origin of the word ' scourge . ' " The creature 's quest to procreate is without equal . " It will consume the innards " of as many as 6 to 9 human , before reaching a size , allowing it to self-propagate .

Oh , what have we got here ? Oh , nice . I 'm making a living , bub . Those are the remains of a friend of mine . Oh . Oh . Who was it ? That was Sheriff Ty Durst , a legend in this town . He was killed while in pursuit of a murder suspect . That is a terrible shame . I appreciate your cooperation . Oh , hey , you got it , Officer . Well , keep it together . Is this for real ? - These things infested parts of the Old World . They used electricity to get it out of people . The Taser gun . You 're genius . Well , it took you long enough to notice . This shows how to capture it . " The scourge has few weaknesses such as deathly aversion to alcohol . " The wine at the church . What ? " In all my research " I have found no documented method " of killing the creature . " The death of the possessed body " means nothing , as it will retreat inside , using it as a shield .

I will sue you all ! - Calm down ! Is this the guy from Interpol ? Show me the body . [ belches ] Taxi ! Come on . Should we call somebody ? Who do you think is gonna believe our story ? I hardly believe our story . It 's been seven bodies now , Jess . We give up now , that thing , it 's gonna be free to multiply . So what , then ? We have to get it out of him ourselves . The way to do it ... is all right here . You still have the key to the old lady 's coach house ? Okay . We 're in business . Hmm . [ growling ] Jess ? - He 's still in the bar . I 've been keeping watch . You sure this is how you want to do this ? You have any better ideas , please let me know . So , what do you think ? Wow . Let 's do this . This guy doesn 't have much time . [ belches ] Give me more nuts ! [ belching continues ] Hey . A beer , please . And a bourbon straight . Thank you . [ laughs , belches ] It 's taken care of . It 's not gonna happen . Again , the same . Hi . How are you doing tonight ? A whole lot better . How about you ? Not too good , fat man . Heh . What could possibly be wrong in your world ? See him ? That 's my boyfriend . He 's been cheating on me with that wench for weeks . Treated me like dirt for years . Tonight it ends . Really ? Tonight ... I 'm gonna teach him a lesson . I 'm going to sleep with the fattest , ugliest man in this bar . Namely you . How about it ? Always happy to help a damsel in distress . Okay , let 's go then . What , now ? It 's now or never , big boy . Oh , now , now . Uh- - Just one thing . Can I ... [ stomach gurgling ] ... take pictures ? Even better . [ laughs ] Wait , wait , wait . You already have a hotel room ?

Are you ready ? Just about . What ? You 're hammered . Pretty much . I need his undivided attention . Ah . Whoa , what 's with the rope ? I don 't do rope . We either do it my way , or I go out there and I find someone else . Rope is good . I do rope . Good . [ laughs ] You know , it 's just that I 've- - It 's never been done to me before .

Fortunately , it 's only been an hour since it infected you , so you might survive . Okay , what we 're gonna do is , we 're gonna run an electrical current through your body . That should bring it to the surface . Then I 'm gonna grab it with these tongs , gonna pull it out of you , and put it into that vessel filled with wine , where it should fall into suspended state .

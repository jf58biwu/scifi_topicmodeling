 Dr Jackman , where are you ? Gone away . The most powerful creature on the planet , that 's what I 'm looking at . He 's capable of anything , but only if he thinks he can get away with it . Mr Hyde , you don 't play these games , not with me ! He 's got a knife . Minimum necessary force . You understand me ? My neck on the line . My personal neck . - Mrs Jackman ? - Good morning . It 's complicated . You 're my mother or you 're not , it 's simple . Rules of estrangement . Do we kiss now ? I 've forgotten . Bad news . I 'm not in love with Dr Jackman . Good work , Mr Syme . You 're welcome . You are a direct descendent of Dr Henry Jekyll , correct ? And yet , Dr Henry Jekyll had no family , correct ? Then how can anything be simple ? How 's Mum this morning ? Nobody in or out , one door ! Where is she , uh ? There 's a woman called Katherine , she 'll contact you . Help her . - I won 't ever stop fighting him . - Then he 'll kill you . Then , I won 't die . I have a wife and children . I won 't die . Subtitles : Nathbot I didn 't get any sleep , Daddy . Means you didn 't get any sleep either . That 's body share for you ! Tired , Daddy ? I bet you are . Bet you 're tired as anything .. Close your eyes , Daddy . Let me drive . Trash one more hotel room and ... I can chain both your feet ! Sleep , Tom . Sleep , darling . It 's ok , close your eyes . Sleep . Sleep . Come on , my love . Close those eyes . Hang that hat . Wait there , I 've got to get tickets . The machine is outside , can you see it ? I will be outside . Don 't pick your nose . There 's a man . Mister ? It 's ok , he 's fine . - What did you do to him ? - Nothing . - What did he do ? - I didn 't do anything ! Get away from him . Sweetie , what did he do ? Where did the other man go ? What other man ? Darling , there was no other man . Where did he go ? Sweetie , there wasn 't another man . I was just there , I 'd have seen . I won 't let him hurt you . I won 't let him hurt anyone . I promise . It 's me . It 's him . It 's him . Don 't say where you are . Are you on a train ? They know we 're listening . They guess . So , how are you ? Any visits from our friend ? I try to avoid him . How ? Staying awake . A train ? It 's been a week , you haven 't been awake that whole time . Jesus , a train . So what , " a train " ? He 's on a cell phone . Katherine , tell him to hang up and to switch off the phone now . - Katherine ! - Just a minute ! Dr Jackman , the longer he 's constrained , the worse he gets . He 's like a dog , you need to run him . If I let him run , he will run to my children . You don 't know that . Who told you that ? I did . Will you please tell him to hang up ? He 's just making threats . The last time he saw your kids , he saved Eddie 's life . For a laugh . He 'd have killed him too for a laugh . - You don 't understand him . - Maybe you don 't . I can 't let him free , he 's trying to take over ! Dr Jackman , hang up , switch off the phone now . Tell Katherine I 'm sorry I shouted , I 'll be fine . Tell her not to worry . Damn it . You could phone him back , if it 's important . He 'll have withheld his number . He 's not that stupid . He 's exactly that stupid . Come on ... But he 's hung up . Doesn 't matter . Phone is still switched on . If it can be texted you can be tracked . How long have you been able to do this ? Well , I know where that blonde on reception lives ... And I know you know too . Track Jackman , and you 're rehired . I was fired ? Mentally . Where are you ? Maybe you 're on the wrong end to that question . Probably , yes . But you 're not at home , I 've tried there . I 'm in a friend 's house , ok ? Staying over . For Christ 's sake , are you alright , Tom ? What 's happening ? What are you doing ? What does it matter what I 'm doing ? It doesn 't . Are the boys there ? Where are they ? Why do you assume it 's not a man friend I 'm staying with ? I don 't . Would it matter if it were ? How 's Eddie ? Still drawing pictures of his daddy fighting lions . Thinks you 're a superhero now . What happened in there ? So , where are they staying tonight ? They got this school trip tomorrow , I couldn 't bring them . - They 're staying with ... - Don 't tell me ! Don 't tell me where they are . Don 't tell me where you are either . I love you . Close those eyes . Hang that hat . Drift away with me . Claire ? Look at you . Look at my poor baby . Sleep . Just sleep . I can 't . He 'll go to our boys . He 'll take our boys . The boys are safe with me , love . Leave the boys to me . You 're him . Get away from me , you 're him ! Well , of course it 's me , Daddy ! Who else lives inside your head ? But don 't I scrub up nice ? Just let go . Let me dream for you . I know what you want . I know what you like . I 've picked . Sleep , Daddy . Sleep with me . Get away from me ! My , my , Daddy ! Where did that come from ? I do declare I 'm more than flattered ! Don 't speak to me out of her mouth . Don 't you ever do that ! What 's so special about her ? Whiny little Claire ? Oh , Tom , why have you left me , Tom ? Oh , Tom , come back to me ! Oh , Tom , I 'm so sad ! And so wronged , and so lonely . But don 't I always dress nice when you visit ! Love me , Tom ! Don 't you get sick of that shit ? Don 't talk about her . Anything else ! Don 't talk to me about her ! She met me , you know . Looked right at me , didn 't see you . How thick is that ! Lois Lane with half a brain . Don 't ! Just stop now ! Why ? I 'm asking . I 'm serious . Tell me , Daddy , what 's the big deal about Claire ? The big deal ? What , you want to know how I feel about her ? How it feels to miss her ? You 're inside my head . Take a look ! What is that ? What is all that ? Nothing that you 're ready for , you stupid child ! Go away ! Got him . He 's moving . Of course he 's moving , he 's on a train . You don 't really have a hang of England yet , do you ? Find out about that train , I wanna know every place it stops . I didn 't think he had a mobile with him . He must 've picked it up somewhere . Ok , we 're gonna have a location fixed soon , are you ready to go ? We ready ? Final checks , five minutes . Two minutes . - You leaving ? - Yes . I was about to say a few words . The facts are not unconnected . I was just gonna inspire the troops . Make up your mind . See , you 're being funny there . That 's you being funny ... I don 't mind . I enjoy people with a sense of humour . Well , we enjoy you too . I see ... the blonde at reception isn 't working today . So perceptive . Safe home . Don 't bump it ! Don 't bump the corners ! Ok , people . Listen up , English people ! You know what tonight is ? Tonight is the orgasm . Tonight is everything this organization has worked towards ever since it began . Since it was a desk . Tonight is the combination of over one hundred years of planning . We have in our hands one hundred years of the dreams of brilliant men . We have at our disposal some of the most advanced and expensive technology the world has ever seen . What we do not have , are any excuses . It 's gonna be bigger than America . Dr Jackman is coming home . Now ... Look at me . Look at my face . Tonight ... Nobody ... No ... body screws up . And in this organization , when we say " nobody " , that means you . Over a hundred years ... Millions of dollars and no screw ups . Go ! - Thanks for that . - No problem . I 'm always forgetting mine , too . I enjoyed that chat . Me too . Get your men ready . We got him . She isn 't worth it , by the way . Who isn 't ? Don 't put that look on your face . Dump her . You 'll feel like a different man . Now , me ... I always feel like a different man . Yeah , that 's my problem too . Claire ? I 'm home ! You alright ? It 's me . I 'm coming over to see you . By the time you hear this message , I 'll be there . I have questions , old friend . Tom ? Expecting someone else ? The question is , are you ? Drink ? Don 't mind if I do ? Are your daughters here ? No , I think they 're in Bulgaria , one of those countries . You have company , though . Yes , hope you didn 't disturb her . Scotch alright for you ? I said I didn 't want a drink . You might change your mind . Oh , you 've got no idea . Oh , I 'm afraid I do . Still that girl from reception ? My guilty secret . Which apparently everyone knows about . Know the feeling . I imagine you do . I 'm surprised to see you here . A bit risky , isn 't it ? You know they 're looking for you . Taken precautions . Of course , I 'll be there . Just a bit late , that 's what I 'm saying . There 's a lot of helicopters about , this evening . I thought we were friends . Yes , that was the idea . Tell me what you 've discovered so far . I 'm not in your classroom now . Then how will you ever learn ? There really was a Dr Jekyll . In Edinburgh , in the 1860s . A genious and a visionary . - Who experimented on himself . - Courageous too . And turned himself into a monster . A monster , no . Be objective . Turned himself into someone else . More than just " someone " , surely . A demon ? A superman . That 's you being objective , is it ? The human species no longer evolves , remember ? We change the world , it no longer changes us . But at what cost ? Millenia pass and homo sapiens remains unchanged , unimproved , century after century . And then one day ... Dr Jekyll drinks from a flask . And what do you know ? There 's life in the old girl yet . I never drank anything . You don 't have to . It 's part of your inheritance , your birthright . - Because I 'm his descendant ? - Clearly . But Henry Jekyll had no children . Correct . I can 't be his descendant because he didn 't have any . Correct again . Then how come I ... Did you do that ? Was that you ? Happens when ... When I 'm holding him in . Interesting . There was some contention the change might generate a low-level electrical field . I 'm afraid I was sceptical . Do you mind if I make a few notes ? I 'm not a bloody experiment ! What on Earth gives you that idea ? Who 's following me ? - We are . - Who 's " we " ? Who do you think ? The Institute ? Klein Utterson , the people I worked for ! Klein Utterson exist to follow you . You are its sole purpose . Is anything in my life not a lie ? Not much , Tom . I wasn 't even really making a note . What are you doing ? A way powerful sedative . Count backwards from ten . Idiot ! You bloody idiot ! Sit down and let it happen , there 's nothing you can do . For God 's sake ... Listen to me ! What sends me to sleep wakes him up ! You just committed suicide ! - How long have I got ? - You should be under by now . Well , I 've good at hanging on . Sit . What ? Sit on it , sit ! What are you doing ? I need to find drug . Tom , this is pointless . On the chair ! D 'you think I 'm gonna let you tie me up ? I know how dangerous Hyde is ! Hyde 's an animal . I 'm dangerous ! - What 're you doing ? - Sit ! A knife ? Seriously , you 'd never use it , Tom . You wait . If Hyde wakes up with a knife , he 'll think it 's Christmas . On the chair ! Ok , ok ! Tom , this is crazy ... - The wine cellar . - What ? It locks , right ? It 's secure . We can contain him . You 're gonna lock yourself in ? If I let Hyde go free now , he 'll run to my children . He has already been to see your children and he didn 't do them any harm . He tried to save Eddie 's life ! That was before I locked him up for a couple of weeks . Why would you do that ? Because they 're my children , my family , my life . He 's not taking any of it . Key ! Desk , top drawer . Come on . What 're you doing now ? - You 're coming with me . - What ? You don 't need me ! Funny thing , I don 't trust you anymore . You 're locking me in with Hyde ? Yes , I know . I 'm tied up , for Christ 's sake , this is inhuman ! - Any minute now ... - Listen , Tom . There 's no point . They 're tracking your phone . I don 't have a phone , they 're tracking somebody else 's . Probably half-way to Manchester now . Hello , help ! I 'm here ! It 's me ! Naughty old me . Who is this ? Who would be following you ? From the train , remember ? I 'm the guy who lent you the phone . Hello , Mister , I have that problem too . Mister , I can take a hint . Help me ! You could have killed me ! Yes , and this is my good side . Hello , what 's happening ? Is everything alright ? Run , run for your life ! Get away from here ! Help me , please ! Anybody hear me ? - Eat your children ! - No ! Eat your children ! 4-7-4-8 . What was that ? Him . He got the combination . Tom , listen ... I need to hide this where he can 't find it . Open , open ... Open it ! Open . Swallow , swallow . Swallow it , swallow ! - How are we gonna get out of here now ? - I hope you 're regular . You ... You were on the floor . How did you ... I was calling for help , she heard me ... Tom , I 'm really sorry , I never meant for this to happen , but ... she was worried , I suggested she came over ... Who ? Tom ? What 's wrong ? What are you doing ? Claire ... Don 't look . Please . Don 't look . Tom , are you alright ? Hi , honey . I 'm home . Hello , can you hear me ? Stay still , I 'm gonna get help . Don 't move . You 're hurt . Hurt ? You 're bleeding . I don 't think it 's my blood . What happened to you ? I don 't know . Ah , Daddy , this is so much better ! Wine , a woman , a tied up old guy ... Ok , not sure we 're going with that last one . Tom is gone , honey . Dr Jackman has left the building . It 's the night shift . Mrs Jackman ? Oh , Daddy ... You 're spoiling me ! Listen , I haven 't had a woman in days . Seriously , a gust of wind and I go off . So ... I hope you don 't have any plans that involve walking straight . You either . Where 's Tom ? You just missed him . Peter ? What is this , what 's happening ? You wanted to know where your husband goes ... This is where he goes . I 've met you . You 're Billy , you 're Tom 's cousin Billy . Lovely to see you again . How are the kids ? Where is my husband ? Your husband 's standing right in front of you . My husband is Tom Jackman . Tom Jackman is also Billy . He 's both of them . How can he be two people ? You saw it happen . How can you be two people ? What are you ? I thought I married a man . You miscounted . Claire , be careful . Never try to hit me , Mrs Jackman , when I haven 't eaten . It 's just a tip . Keep away from me . Keep away from me ! Oh , you are gonna be fun ! Let 's find somewhere more comfortable . - Did somebody lock us in ? - You did . Oh , Daddy ! Where 's the key ? Come on , you must have seen him where he put it . Have you got the key ? Where is it ? Thank you . Where 's the key ? You 've been dribbling . Now , why have you been dribbling ? Did my Daddy make you dribble ? Clever Daddy ! You know what ? I think I found the key . Arrest you ? Why would I be arresting you for ? There 's been a murder , hasn 't there ? That 's why you 're here . Then , arrest me . It 's Jackman . That 's a recording from a security camera inside Syme 's house . What about the phone we 're tracking ? Off in the woods somewhere . Doesn 't matter , that 's him . Awesome ! Tell ' em no one goes in until I get there . Fantastisch ! For God 's sake , Tom ... Tom 's gone , love . Tom 's asleep . As strange as it may seem , I am on your side . Oh , that 's nice ! Thanks for that . Listen to me . You 've never killed before . Jackman wouldn 't let you . You 're sure you wanna start now ? You think you can really do it ? You 've never killed before ! Stop me in the middle if I 'm doing it wrong . Listen to me ! Nearly forgot . Anesthetic . Count backwards from ten . Oh , dear , Mrs Jackman ... It 's gonna take a bit more than that with me ! Fine . I 'm your wife . Don 't ever ask me to hit you . Just a tip . It 's the wrong key . What ? It 's too small , it 's the wrong key . You stupid bitch ! Husband , I have questions . I 'm not your husband ! What , because you 've changed ? I don 't know what you are , if you 're a schizoid , or a werewolf , or the first man to discover PMT . But honey , yes , you are my husband . So ... What the hell do you mean , you haven 't had a woman in days ? - You 're not serious ! - Look at my face . I 'm not your husband ! You 're Tom Jackman . No , we just share a dick . Yeah , and it 's mine . How many ? How many what ? Girls , women , little boys , how many ? - I don 't know ? - You don 't know ? I 'm not married to you ! Yes , you are . Get used to it ! How many ? I don 't know . I don 't count . Jesus . What kind of animal are you ? Well , maybe if Dr Jackman was getting any , I wouldn 't always wake up with a hard-on ! I try . He won 't let me anywhere near him . He can 't , he 's afraid he 'll turn into me . Would he ? What if if did ? Why would I turn him into you ? Mrs Jackman ... You 'd turn any man into me . Are you flirting with me ? Don 't flirt with me . Listen to her , I was your husband a minute ago . That 's the problem . Why do you have to go out screwing everything in sight ? Why didn 't you tell me about this ? I am telling you . The other you . The real you . I am the real me ! Tell me this . Are you using protection ? I need to know . I have children ! Are you using protection ? Yes , yes , he makes me . Great . Very considerate . Just lovely . Ever considered using restraints ? Not too close , Mrs Jackman . Don 't put your hands in the cage . You threatening me ? Warning you . I spent an entire evening with you . You played with my children . Our children . Why should I be afraid of you ? Because I 'm not your husband , and I don 't know when to stop . Then why did you warn me ? - Your clothes don 't fit . - They 're not mine . Turn around for me . - What ? - On the spot . Twirl , husband . You 're taller than him . A bit slimmer . Younger . Maybe five years , maybe more . I remember that arse . What else is different ? Tricky . Dream on . What about ... memories ? Do you have his memories ? Bits and pieces sometimes . Places and faces ... I look at you and know exactly what you look like naked . No , you don 't . How can you be so sure ? You went elsewhere . Flirting with me , Mrs Jackman ? Torturing you . I think he 's name is Syme , and this is his house . That 's right . You 're in his house ? Yes , I 'm in his house . In that dress ? Peter 's a friend , he doesn 't think of me that way . What were you thinking ? What was I thinking while you were out screwing half of London ? I 'm not your husband ! Then why are you jealous ? So , how do you two work it ? How do you live ? Usually , we have an arrangement . Recently , he 's been chaining me up . What changed ? I found out about you , and the kids , where you live ... And that worried him ? - I make threats . - Why ? Because I don 't like being chained up . Not threats you 'd every carry out . Don 't come any closer , I don 't know what I 'd do . Every time the light flickers , you look at it like it means something . You 're quick . Why , what doest it mean ? He 's trying to wake up . I think he can hear your voice . I want to talk to him . He 's not strong enough to come through . What does that mean ? Listen , no time . Syme is one of them , you can 't trust him . You 've got to ... Got to what ? What do you mean ? Stupid Mrs Jackman ! Don 't call me stupid . Thank you ! I 'm gonna need the key . I can take it . You won 't hurt me . You 're Tom Jackman , I know you won 't . I 'm not your husband ! What have you done ? - It was your idea . - His idea ! You , him , same thing . You stupid bitch ! You threaten my children , you 're not leaving . - Gonna need the key . - You 're not gonna hurt me . Gonna need to get that key back any way I can . You 've never killed anyone before . You 're not gonna start with me . If I 've never killed anyone before , how do I know I wouldn 't enjoy it ? You are Tom Jackman . You would never hurt me . Oh , Mme Jackman , I 'd hurt you . So , Dr Jackman , you killed your wife ? But you don 't have any memory of the instant . You just know . I have episode . Violent episodes . Keep me here long enough and you 'll see . You should put me in restraints . So you keep saying . We don 't deem it necessary . Please , for your own sake . Excuse me . Can I see my wife ? Please . I just need to see what he ... What I did . Please . What 's wrong ? Apparently you 're being transferred . Gotta give me credit , I 'm one hell of a kisser . Didn 't really think you 'd swallow it . What if I had ? I had a back-up plan . I don 't believe you . You should . Tom ... Tom , what 're we gonna do ? I 'm not Tom . Oh , you 're Tom alright . You 're just ... I don 't know , sick . Some weird new kind of sick . I don 't think they 're gonna find a cure any day soon , do you ? We don 't have to . There 's been a cure for over fifty years . Mrs Jackman ... Would you please step away from Mr Hyde ? Gentlemen , could you lower your weapons ? I 'd hate to be taking back a corpse because one of you all sneazed . Thank you . Good to see you again . How are you going to take me anywhere , when I know you can 't shoot me ? See , that 's a funny thing . We really didn 't expect you to become so attached to Dr Jackman 's family . There 's a weakness , Mr Hyde . Are you threatening my family ? Hello , it 's me , Benjamin . The word is : go . I said ... Are you threatening my family ? Excuse me for a moment . Yeah . I am ... explicitely ... and directly ... and emphatically threatening the lives of Dr Jackman 's family . That 's all I wanted to know . There , now , Benjamin . It 'll be over in a moment . It 's alright . Hush now . Count backwards from ten . I 'm sorry , Benjamin can 't come to the phone right now . Don 't move . Please . You have orders not to kill me , right ? First casualty of conflict . Orders . As far as this conflict goes , I 'd say Benjamin might beg to differ . Can 't tell you how fast I am , don 't know exactly . But I 'll tell you this . First one of you who starts getting nervous and pulls that trigger , dead . Then I 'll have a gun , that 's the next two . Dead . Third one kills me , then dies of his injuries . So , what you guys are gonna ask yourselves ... is this : " How much ... did I like ... my boss ? " I don 't think you 're faster than a bullet , but then I 'm not supposed to kill you . And personally ... I couldn 't stand the guy . Mrs Jackman ... I 'm sorry ... but I did like it . Can I call you ? Gentlemen ... If any harm should come to Mrs Jackman , I will kill all of you one by one ! And I shall take my time ! Hope you 'll find a nicer boss ! No problem , we 'll pull him in . Don 't bother . He 's got blood on his hands . Hyde will run , but Jackman will return . Well . Benjamin seems to be dead , I think we should probably tidy up a bit and ... I don 't know phone the police ? Anyone got an aspirin ? Can I see my wife ? Please . I just need to see what he ... What I did . - Please . - Apparently you 're being transferred . Tonight is everything this organization has worked towards ever since it began . Have we met ? Friend of a friend . Tonight is the combination of over one hundred years of planinng . Claire ! Get it open . What is it ? We have in our hands one hundred years of the dreams of brilliant men . Get him in . What 're you doing , what 's happening ? Let go of me ! Dr Jackman is coming home . No , for God 's sake , no ! Please ! No , please , no !

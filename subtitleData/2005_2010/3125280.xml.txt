 I thought telepathy would get you to make me a cuppa . What 's it worth ? What do you want ? I 'll draw you a diagram , shall I ? Nice arse ! MOBILE RINGS Don 't answer it ! Yep . JACK : ' You watching the news ? ' TV : ' There 's speculation that the incidents overnight may be linked . 'Initial reports suggested terrorist involvement ' . 'But some intelligence experts have claimed the incidents may be stunts . 'The first sightings were of UFOs over the Taj Mahal in India . 'They came in just after midnight . 'In London this morning , men in historic dress fired upon police . 'Some religious groups are claiming events overnight 'are a vindication of their teachings . ' Do you think it is terrorists ? Terrorists bomb things . This is different . People didn 't believe us . Now they should . Judgment day is finally here . This is the End of Days . " And I heard but did not understand and I said , ' Master , what is the End of all these things ? ' And he said , " ' Go , Daniel , for the things are closed up and sealed until the end of time . ' " Daniel 12 , verse 10 . Sounds a bit close for comfort . This machine 's on the blink . Keeps losing power . Sorry , don 't let me stop your portents of doom . Or have you finished ? No . More where that came from . Abaddon , the Great Devourer , who 'll lead the world into shadow . Thanks , Ianto , no superstition . You people love any story that denies the randomness of existence . Thanks . That makes me feel better . OK , I 've been fielding calls . The government , UNIT , the CIA ... Half the world are asking one question . Is this anything to do with us ? And is it ? I 've run a profile on every reported temporal anomaly and tracked any physical or temporal pattern . Shit ! The cracks in time trace back here to the rift . This city , this Hub , is the centre . What you 're seeing around the world are ripples and aftershocks . The rift is splintering because of you . What ? You opened it without knowing what you were doing . You 've caused the temporal cracks to widen . Time is seeping through . If it wasn 't for me , you two would still be in the 1940s . So are we going to sit around crying into our lattes , or shall we do something about it ? Bring those who 've fallen through time back here , into the vaults . And do what with them ? We 'll deal with phase one , then phase two . You can 't control time . What are you gonna do ? We 'll think of something ! Hey , this is not the end of the world . I 'm certain of that . COMPUTER BEEPS Priority one attendance - hospital . Mortality rate 's through the roof . They 're designating a hot zone . I 'll go . Tosh , go with him . No , thanks , I 'm fine on my own . And you 'll be even better with me alongside . Shut up and come on . Did you have to pick on him in public like that ? All our actions have consequences . And all your staff have feelings , Jack , even Owen . Well , you 'd know . He brought you back . Would you rather be stuck in World War II ? Hello . 'Gwen , it 's Andy ' . Listen , I didn 't know who else to call . MAN SHOUTS IN LATIN Double murder . Stabbed two blokes in Penarth . Brutal , it was . No mercy . What are we supposed to do ? He doesn 't speak a word of English , and he 's dressed as a Roman soldier ! He 's not , he IS a Roman soldier and he 's shouting in Latin . Only word I could pick out was Gelligaer . Gelligaer . There 's a Roman fort out at Gelligaer . Built around 75AD . He was on his way , time splintered , he ends up here . Excuse me ? Hi . Any time you feel like talking sense ... That soldier came through a crack in time . He 's not serious , is he ? This sort of thing just doesn 't happen . Not in Cardiff . Just cos you can 't understand , doesn 't mean it isn 't true . I know it sounds mad , Andy ... All right , Mulder and Scully . Say I do believe you , which I don 't , cos it 's bollocks . How exactly are we meant to handle a prisoner from 2,000 years ago ? Has he got the same rights as anyone ? How 's this gonna work with the CPS ? We 'll take him off your hands . HE SHOUTS IN LATIN Under any other circumstances , an exuberant Roman soldier would be my idea of a perfect morning . Careful , Jack . PRISONER STOPS SHOUTING Everyone 's saying it , you know . In work , on the streets . Do you think this is the end of the world ? Oh , Andy , don 't be silly . Do you think the world 's gonna end on your shift ? I 've seen you use that smile on a lot of people . What smile ? The smile you use to reassure people when everything 's gone to shit . This was the first one to die . NO ID on her . She just appeared in the middle of AE . Nobody saw her come in , she didn 't register at the desk . So what happened ? She started coughing up blood . We moved her into isolation . An hour later , the staff presented similar symptoms . Which were ? Bite-like bumps , chills , fever , headaches , along with black patches on the skin . Indicating bleeding into the skin and possibly other organs . From the staff , it spread to patients who 'd been in reception . These aren 't contemporary clothes . Her teeth aren 't modern , either . Shit . As soon as we realised the rate of infection , we closed down . How many others are infected ? 30 , maybe 40 . All quarantined off ? We think so . Have their clothes and sheets destroyed . What is it ? That woman isn 't from this century . More like the 14th . It 's the ... it 's the fucking ... Black Death , Tosh . She 's infected Cardiff AE with the plague ... and it 's my fault . The team are instigating procedures . The infected will need 30 milligrams of Streptomycin and Chloramphenicol plus two of Tetracycline . That 's plague medicine . Standard issue for bubonic . Well done , House . That 's what you 're up against . So what are you gonna do now ? Well , you 've got procedures , haven 't you ? Yes , but everybody said Torchwood would sort it out . What if we get more carriers appearing ? We 're working to stop that . We waited for you ! You 've got to stop this ! You 've gotta do something ! No , you 've gotta do something . People are dropping through time and they 'll bring every disease in history through your doors . So you 'd better be ready . Owen ... You scared enough yet ? Cos fuck knows I am ! Come on , Tosh ! Make sure they get the medicine . Call us if things get worse . How much worse can they get ? Owen ? Owen ! Okasan ? SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE TOSH REPLIES IN JAPANESE Tosh ! Come on , stop pissing about . If Owen managed to open the rift to get you and Tosh back , can 't we do the same thing for these people ? We 've got the rift manipulator . There 's a world of difference . We 're talking about taking control of time , not bringing two people back from the past . Besides , look at the damage Owen caused . We mess with it further , we 'll put the planet in danger . Have I ever let you down ? Gwen ? Gwen ? 'I 'm sorry . ' 'I 'm so sorry . ' Gwen ? Gwen ! Come on . Hustle ! Are you sure it was the same guy ? It was definitely him . Bilis , the caretaker of the dancehall . That 's all he said , sorry ? What 's he got to be sorry for ? Coming through ! WEEVIL GROWLS 13 more reports of Weevils . We can 't keep up at this rate . Everything 's on the increase . Can you stop them making that noise ? If you 've got any ideas how . Maybe they 're time sensitive . It 's too much . We 're now full in all vaults across all nine levels . Do you want me to activate the vaults below ? We 've never used them since I 've been here . Do it . Gwen , maybe you 're right . Let 's run a search on your dancehall buddy . We need to find him . OK . WEEVIL MOANS Hello , Ianto . What do you want ? Why are you here ? This isn 't happening . There 's only one way to stop this , before things get worse . People will die , Ianto . Thousands of people . Unless you open the rift . Owen . How was the hospital ? Laugh a bloody minute . They 've got an outbreak of the Black Death . What ? Oh , my God ! Have they got it under control ? Tosh ! How are they coping ? Um , Owen got the place quarantined and organised treatments for those who 've been infected . Only consolation is , it 's treatable . But what happens when the next carrier comes through , Jack ? Someone carrying smallpox or Ebola , or something from the future ? What do we do then ? Well , it 's not doing us any good speculating . We need to be prepared . We 're helpless . We 're putting sticking plasters on gaping wounds ! What do you suggest ? I suggest you lead us and you tell us what the instructions are . Owen ... No , come on . You 're all thinking it too . You 're the big man here . You keep all the secrets . Well , now 's the time to tell us how the hell we 'll get out of this ! You want to know a secret ? There is no solution . I can 't fix this . Because this was never meant to happen . The first thing you learned was don 't mess with the rift . But you disobeyed those orders . And now everything that 's happening is down to you . I only disobeyed to get you back . And now people are dying . So I shouldn 't have bothered ? Who the fuck are you , anyway ? Jack Harkness ? You don 't even exist . We 've looked . So if you 're not even a real person , then why should I follow your orders ? Get out . What ? Get out ! I 'm relieving you of your duty . No . You can 't do that ! Bollocks , you are ! Jack , wait . You 're done here . What , so that 's it ? The whole world is going to shit and you 're going to fire me ? For God 's sake ! Both of you ! We need to stick together on this . If I can 't rely on you , if I don 't have your complete trust , you don 't belong here . That goes for the rest of you . Anyone who agrees with Owen , leave now . So now we know how it is . So that leaves me 24 hours to savour the good times . What are you talking about ? Think about it , Gwen . Nobody leaves this place intact . Sometime in the next 24 hours ... I get Retconned . All my memories erased . I don 't know where or when , but he 'll get me . Jack , this has gone far enough . So I guess this is goodbye . Good luck with the end of the world . I would say thanks for the memories ... Jack , for God 's sake ! 'OK , guys , Bilis 's shop is coming up 20 metres on your left ' . Wow . Some of this stuff must go back centuries . He scavenges antique pieces from the past , brings them here , sells them for a profit . Not a bad business plan . We all have to earn a living . You 're from 1941 . As you were . Hello , again . How can you be in two time zones at once ? I can step across eras , like you 'd walk into another room . At first , it was the most incredible gift . Now I know the reality ... it 's a curse . Why ? I can see the whole of history , but I don 't belong anywhere within it . So , your return to this time had a price . Time 's splintering . This city exists on a rift in time . The only way to make it right is to fully open that rift - let it suck back what fell through . No way . It 's too dangerous . Can we even do that ? Of course you can . Isn 't that right , Captain ? Jack ? You 've seen what happened . If we open that rift fully , millions of lives will be at risk . And yet , if you don 't , more will fall through . Lives will be lost . You know so much , you 're coming back with us . I 'm sorry . Damn it ! Trace the temporal activity around this location . We need to find out where he is . Come on . CLOCKS CHIME Gwen . I am not your enemy . In the cells , why did you say you were sorry ? Sometimes it 's better to live in ignorance ... unless ... Do you really want to know ? Know what ? Hold my hands . I 'll show you . OK . Only if you 're sure . I 'm sure . I 'm sorry ! What did you just show me ? The future . What took you so long ? Gwen ? Gwen ! Is that you ? Yeah ... It 's me . Ah ! You 're cleaning the oven ! Aye , somebody got to , love . Listen , we gotta go . Why , what 's happened ? We 've gotta go . Let me finish here first ... Rhys , we 've gotta go . Now ! Aw , here we go again , always a hurry since you started that bloody job ... I 'm sorry . ( Owen . ) Owen . Oh ... Jesus . Diane ... Oh , Jesus . I 'm lost , Owen . I can touch you . I don 't understand . Where did you end up ? Please . Bring me back , Owen . You can do that , can 't you ? I don 't know . Everything 's out of sync . Please . Please bring me back . Open the rift . Do you want another drink there , mate ? # Can it call you or maul you # And drive you insane # Can it make you remember # Time is in place # Now I 'm begging you # I 'm begging you ... # Take it easy . What 's going on ? Am I dreaming ? This is where I work . You work in a prison ? These are just the cells . You locked me in a cell ? What the hell are you playing at ? I was just trying to keep you safe . I was safe at home ! No , you weren 't . You really weren 't . Listen , Gwen , you 'd better tell me exactly what 's going on cos I 've taken some shit over the past few months . What 's all this ? Rhys , listen to me , I need you to trust me . OK , it may not seem like it at the moment , but I 'm just trying to take care of you . I love you , sweetheart . LOUD MOAN FROM ABOVE What the hell was that ? Just try and relax and I 'll come back for you . What do you mean ? You 're not going to leave me down here ! I 'm sorry . Gwen ! Gwen ! I 'm sorry . Shit ! Did he wake up ? Yeah . Yeah , he did . Tosh , can you bring up the CCTV of the vaults ? Er , just leave it on the screen , I know it sounds crazy , but ... Sure , no problem . Thank you ... for helping me bring him here . I can 't understand how Bilis was able to show you that vision . It was so real , Tosh . I was in my flat . It smelt like my flat , it had all the sounds of my flat . I touched the blood . I can still feel it on my hands . Rhys 's blood . Not gonna happen . Come on , there 's still work to be done . What 's going on ? We 've got a security breach . All right , nobody panic . RHYS ! KLAXON SOUNDS Oh , do you work here ? I 'm Rhys ... .. Gwen 's boyfriend . RHYS GROANS NO ! No ! He 's gone ! He 's gone ! Please ... No ! Please ! No ! We can ... we can bring him back ! There 's nothing we can do . Yes , there is ! My boy . What am I going to do ? What am I going to do ? SHE SCREAMS No ! No ! GWEN 'S SCREAMS ECHO I 'll have to tell his family . We 'll deal with it . The way you dealt with that porter the first time I met you ? No , you won 't deal with him , Ianto . Gwen , I 'm so sorry . You never even met him . This is what happens here . We all end up alone . Not me . No way . You bring him back . No . The resurrection gauntlet ... Was destroyed . Something else . I said no . No , there 's something wrong with time , so we , we can go back to the moment , to the very moment ... Gwen ... There 's something you can do , otherwise WHAT 'S THE FUCKING POINT OF YOU ? ! You , you bring him back ! Bring him back ! You bring him back ! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME , JACK FUCKING HARKNESS ? I 'm sorry . Do you ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . Oh , shit . What happened ? You came back ! Are you all right ? You OK ? You all right ? Don 't touch me ! How many other people have got to suffer ? I 'm gonna fix this . I 'm opening the rift . Make sure you stop him . No . We 're gonna help him . Bilis was right , he said open the rift and everything goes back to normal . Owen 's right . I 'm going to get Rhys back . Gwen . No ! Gwen ! Enter Emergency Protocol One . Out the way , I 'll do this . ALARM SOUNDS Get away from the computer , Gwen . Jack ... This is a trap . All the cracks , they 're diversions . This is what Bilis wants . What are you afraid of , Jack ? Rhea Silva . I said , " Move . " What the hell are you doing ? ! Final warning . Come on , Jack . You 're a united front now ? Toshiko , the poor girl who 'll screw any passing alien that gives her a pendant ? Owen , so strong , he gets in a cage with a Weevil , desperate to be mauled . Or Ianto , hiding his cyber-girlfriend in the basement . Your three comrades here pumped bullets into her , remember ? I 've got to get Rhys back . Yeah , cos you 're so in love with Rhys that you spend half your time in Owen 's bed . Fuck you ! We 're relieving you of your command , " Captain " . We 're getting back what we lost ! Shit ! Stay down ! You 're in charge , Owen ? You 've gotta have significantly bigger balls . I 'm sick of people doubting me . What have you done ? We 've still got to do Jack 's . KLAXON BLARES SOLDIER SHOUTS GWEN SCREAMS Oh , my God ! What have you done ? Help me move him ! Keep moving ! It 's going to be all right , Jack . Everything is going to go back to normal . From out of the darkness , he is come . What is he talking about ? Son of the Great Beast , cast out before time , chained in rock and imprisoned beneath the rift . What ? ! All hail Abaddon , the Great Devourer . Come to feast on life . BEAST ROARS CAR ALARMS BLARE The whole world shall die beneath his shadow . PEOPLE SCREAM I look upon you , my God , and know my work is done . How do we stop it ? Tell me what to do , Jack . Just you ... Get me to an open space . What are you gonna do ? If Abaddon is the bringer of death , let 's see how he does with me . If he feeds on life , then I 'm an all-you-can-eat buffet . No , wait ! Wait , you 're too weak ! Get out of here ! GO ! Drive as fast as you can . Jack ! Bring it on ! ABADDON ROARS JACK SCREAMS GWEN SOBS You 're here ! Weren 't you just here a minute ago ? You 're here ! Go to bed . Get some sleep ... and I 'll be back for you . You 're certain ? He 's ice cold . No vital signs . He survived when you shot him . When I first joined , he said he couldn 't die . He was wrong . I want to sit with him . Gwen ... I want to sit with him . ( Wake up . ) ( Jack . ) How long 's she gonna do this ? It 's been days . We have to face up to it . He 's not coming back . I believe in him . Let him go , Gwen . JACK : Thank you . I ... I forgive you . OWEN SOBS What 's happened to the rift ? It closed up when Abaddon was destroyed . But it 's gonna be more volatile than ever . The visions we had . We all saw people we loved . What did you see ? Nothing . There was nothing . Jack ... what would have tempted you ? What visions would have convinced you to open the rift ? The right kind of Doctor . Jack ... ? Where are they with those coffees ? MACHINE BEEPS Jack ? TARDIS THRUMS Jack ? DOOR OPENS Did you see Jack on your way in ? No . I thought we 'd tidied up in here ! What 's the matter ? Um ... he was just here . Something 's taken him . Jack 's gone .

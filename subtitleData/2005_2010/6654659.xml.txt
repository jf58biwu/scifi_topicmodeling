 Mother ? I missed you . I don 't even know you . Your light is strong . Let it guide you through your memories . I 'm a waitress , and a part-time student . I don 't think I can do this . ( ♪ Humming ) I 'm scared . When you were a girl , I used to rock you at our special place . Remember . DG , breakfast ! Wind last night made a real mess of things . Branches took out a transformer . Well , you better fix it before it fixes us . Come on , woman , I can 't work on an empty tank . Besides , I need our expert on this one , if she ever wakes up . Morning , sleepyhead . All right ... Was I asleep ? Dead to the world for 14 hours . Figured you must have had something on your mind . Lord knows I have . I was wrong , DG . You have a right to your own life . I had no business looking through your stuff last night . That was last night ? Mm-hm . Had that crazy nightmare again , huh ? In technicolor . Well , you 're awake now . So you better help your dad before he wrecks this place . But the farm was wrecked . Mercy me . Have you been having those chili cheese fries before bed again ? ( Sighs ) Your stories must have worked their way into my subconscious , because there was a frozen lake and a palace , and my mother was a queen , and she was trying to get me to remember this thing about an emerald , so I could stop my evil sister . Well , did you ? Remember , I mean ? No , and when I didn 't , she sicked these monkey-bats on me . Well , you got the storm part right , baby girl . We got a heck of mess to clean up . That 's the cold hard reality . Finally talking some sense . Heck with that . You know I 'd pick a good story over work any day . I 'd rather hear the big secret about that emerald the queen whispered into your ear . Aw , Popsicle , I can 't remember . It was something ... Hmm ... What something , honey ? I never said she whispered anything into my ear . Sorry , baby girl . Guess I blew it . It 's OK , Popsicle . I know you tried your best . ( DG ) That was all fake ? You are twisted . Why ? Because with a little re-wiring , I 've gotten something I 've missed out on for too long . A father 's love , a mother 's affection . Where are my real parents ? Our parents ? Well , Daddy , the thief , abandoned us after you ... died . Mother never forgave him for that . Had his name officially banished from the lands . Ever the drama queen . Where is she ? There came a time when she had to be ... isolated . Mother ? DG , where are you ? Let her go . That can be arranged . But first you have to do something for me . Fear not , my child , there is one thing that can stop her - the emerald of the eclipse . ( Whispering ) The secret to finding it now lives inside of you . When the time is right , you will return . ( Azkadellia ) DG , just ... tell me where the emerald is . Just tell me what she whispered to you , and I will take you to her . I promise . I don 't remember . That was a long time ago . We can pry those memories out of her . Zero , she 's my sister . ( Sighs ) I guess I haven 't really made this much of a family reunion , have I ? Well , I wasn 't expecting a picnic . I want to show you something , share something with you . " The majestic queen of the O.Z. " Had two lovely daughters , she " Double eclipse it is foreseen " Light meets dark in the stillness between " But only one and one alone " Shall hold the emerald and take the throne " ( Sighs ) So , what is that ? The great and ominous prophecy of the O.Z. ? It 's a nursery rhyme . A few couplets that roll pleasingly off the tongue . It 's not who we are , DG . You tried to kill me . I was just a child . You know , I ... I foolishly believed the part about ... " Only one and one alone . " And you don 't now ? No . I believe that the prophecy can be what you and I make of it . ( Sighs ) DG , we were such good friends . We spent hours imagining what the O.Z. would be like when we grew up . Please , you must remember that . We were friends ? We 'd explore the woods , gather apples , skip little stones across the lake . We made Mother crazy with worry . Apples ? No . I 'm not buying what you 're doing with this whole " keys to the kingdom " crap . I 'm not doing anything . I just want ... what the prophecy can bring to both of us . It 's our birthright . It 's our chance to make a new O.Z. Just tell me where it is . I don 't remember . DG ... My lovely little sister . That was the wrong ... answer . Now we do it your way . I 'll take her for a reading with Lylo . If you remember nothing else , remember this . The next time I snuff out your insignificant little life , there 'll be no one standing by to save you . ( Gasps ) Uh . Raw ? Cain ... ( Grunts ) Aaah ! Now it 's dinner for three . ( Whimpering ) Lylo ... No ! He 's not one of us anymore . ( Breathing shallowly ) ( Zero ) No iron suit for you this time . No wife and child crying for years to free you from it . My family 's alive ? My family 's alive ? My family 's alive ? ( Gunshot echoes ) ( Cocks gun ) You 've been sleeping for hours like a ... like a baby with his pacifier . I thought you were dead . Ditto . You know , I may have saved you from hypothermia , but ... this is what saved your life . It stopped the bullet . DG ... Azkadellia . Raw ? I don 't know , I can 't find him . Either they took him , too , or ... he 's dead , or ... Maybe he ran away . You know , you really should do something about that bitter cynicism of yours , Cain . Why ? Someone 's got to keep your wide-eyed optimism in check . Hey , Glitch ... What ? I owe you one . You know , Cain , professional psychiatric therapy is only a crow 's call away these days . I think a man like you , with your issues of masculinity , and the ... we call it the " boy scout syndrome " ... No ... Leave him alone ! No ... No ! No ! No ... No ! ( Sobs ) No ! No ! ( Muffled ) Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! ( Water bubbling ) ( Muffled ) Please stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! A whisper , Lylo . All I 'm looking for is a secret whispered to a little girl ! ( Sobs ) Lylo can 't find . ( Screams ) Something ... ( Azkadellia ) Focus ! ... protecting her memories ! ( Azkadellia ) Break through . Now ! LyIo is trying ! Don 't try ! Do ! How can he remember , if I can 't ? What did Mother whisper into DG 's ear about the emerald ? Emerald only thing stop Azkadellia . Focus , Lylo ! Where is it ? ( Electrical crackling ) ( Screams ) All is gray ! Emerald within the gray gale . ( Gasps ) Gray gale ? What is the gray gale ? Don 't know . Can 't see . Where is it ? Hurts to reach into her memories . Memories surrounded by ... magic . LyIo ! ( Gasps and sighs ) Magic ? I don 't have to guess who 's responsible for that , do I ? Mother ... More secrets ? You 've cloaked DG 's memories with your magic . You 're the one who forced secrets into our lives . Well , you did your work a little too well . All traces of the gray gale are gone . She 'll never remember now . Are you surprised I know about the gray gale ? What do you know ? Learn to love me , Mother . Learn to trust me , and I will give you back your throne , put the crown upon your head , and kneel at your feet . The loyal daughter you always dreamed of . You 're not my daughter . How could you say such a thing ? You made me who I am . No . Tell me where the emerald is . Not while there 's still a breath in my body . ( Thunderclap ) Raw sorry . Raw run away . Raw scared . We all scared , Raw . Don 't let them do this to Kalm . He needs us . Needs you . Sleep . ( Footsteps approach ) ( Gate opens ) This one will read the girl next . ( Gasping ) Take him to the Gilded Hall for initialization . No ! Aargh ! Oh , please . Try again . ( Cries out ) Lylo ... Lylo ? ( Roaring ) ( Roaring ) Raw ? ( Squeaking ) What are you looking at ? I have a theory which can 't be unproven . Mystic Man ? You 're alive ! It is called ... the " or not " theory . Oh , I have so much to tell you . Ah , ah , ah ... You know that they wouldn 't put you in a cell near mine unless they wanted to hear us talk . She 's ... she 's listening ? First , you must journey to the North , or not . Yes , I journeyed to the North . I went to the ice palace , and I know who my mother is . Are you sure you 're not still on the vapors ? ( Mouthing ) I have never been clearer in my whole life . It 's all coming back to me . My troubled childhood , a rich life of scholarly pursuit , my brief but glamorous life in show business , although that part is a little bit hazy . ( Rumbling ) Did you feel that ? Yeah . They 're testing a machine . What sort of machine ? The complete destruction of the O.Z. Is that why she needs the emerald ? ( Mouthing ) O ... K. What are we going to do ? There is so much I would like to tell you , but ... Azkadellia 's eyes and ears are all over us now . OK . Tell me what you know about the ... ( Whispers ) .. gray gale . ( Laughs ) The gray gale ... is a myth , dreamt up by the ancients ... ( Sighs ) .. to entertain their children . Time to change tack . ( Gate opens ) Long time no see . Azkadellia ? A little older , a lot smarter , and most definitely still in charge . Nothing like a violent coup ... to win the hearts and minds of a kingdom . Good . You still have a memory . It may be the one thing that can save you . What do you want ? What I want is the very thing you 've devoted your feeble life to . Magic , my friend . Those who can 't do , teach . Remember ? Your freedom for your help . My help ? I mean , I 'm not saying they called me twinkletoes , or anything , but I cut quite a rug . ( Chuckles ) Oh , you can make a face , Cain , but it 's true . There was a time when I was a fantastic dancer . She may have taken my brains , but rhythm ? That comes directly from your ... Do you have any bright ideas how to get in there ? I mean , I don 't mind taxing my half a brain for DG , but just once I wish that someone would acknowledge me for my rhythm , which , as I was trying to say before I was so rudely interrupted , comes directly from the soul . Sometimes , Cain , you make me feel just like those ladies at the dance did , like I blend right into the wallpaper . That 's a good idea . You want to dance ? I 'll lead , you follow . What I can tell you ... is that your mother cloaked your memories in magic , so that Azkadellia cannot get to them . Great . The only thing is , neither can I. Yes , you can . My mother was really good with the " to do " list , she just wasn 't so good with the " how to do " lists . She said you must unlock your memories . Your light must brighten a place that is dark . In the South . It 's where you 'll find a message about your future and your past . ( Chuckling ) Fiery , aren 't they ? Yeah . Never seen ' em that large . Shh , shh ... ( Laughing ) ( Cain joins laughter ) Ooh ! Mm-hm . Oh ! ( Man calls out ) Left , left ! Left , right , left ! Left , left ! Left , right , left ! You 're a deep well , Glitch . It 's all about rhythm . Come on , let 's go . So eager to please the wrong sister . Azkadellia ... as I live and breathe . ( Laughs ) So far . I don 't know which is more pathetic , you on the vapors or off . Your sister is more powerful than you . She will never ... be as powerful as me . Then why are you so scared ? I know you ... witch . What do you know ? ( DG ) No ! Stop that ! ( Mystic Man groans ) Unlock your memories . ( Mystic Man groans ) ( Wheezing ) Not so great and terrible after all , huh ? ( Squeaking ) ( Dog barking ) ( Squeaking ) Hey ! ( Barks ) Do I know you ? ( Growls ) ( Footsteps ) ( Barks ) Hey ... ( Whines ) Thanks . ( Growls ) ( Barking ) My friend 's this way . Ah ! DG ? DG ! Raw ! Are you OK ? Let 's get you out of here . ( Growls ) Longcoats . Ow ! That could bust a zipper . Glitch ... Hey there , princess . Cain , you 're alive ! Barely . Furry lips here really packs a punch . We 've got to get out of here . Well , we can 't go out the way we came in . ( Barking ) This way . Come on . ( Alarm blares ) ( Running footsteps ) DG ! ( Whines ) Which way ? ( Barks ) Which way ? You 're taking directions from a dog . Left or left ? ( Barks ) I 've got them , sir ! Longcoats ! ( Barks ) I think he wants us to go in there . I think we 'd better hurry . Let 's go . You 're a good boy ! You knew the way ! No , it ... it 's OK . It 's OK , I 'm a friend . I 'm a friend of your mother 's . She sent me to help . We 'd better go . We 've got an emerald to find . Good , good . Are you ready , kid ? Yeah . That machine that we escaped through ? The Mystic Man said that she was going to use that to destroy the O.Z. Wait a second . You saw the Mystic Man ? He 's dead . She killed him . He said that she needs the emerald to make the machine work . That 's interesting . How ? Folks ... I suggest we keep moving . Sorry , pooch , but this is where we part company . Part ? With the Longcoats on our trail and the mobats in the sky , I don 't have time to figure out what your angle is in all of this . My angle is her mother sent me to help . And you did . I 'd even thank you for what you did back there If I knew who you were , or what . Whoa . Mr. Suspicious , this is the man ... Dog ... ( Whispers ) Thingie ... who helped us escape ! Shape-shifter . Yes . Yes , Mr. Raw . He knew your name . How did you know his name ? I know all of your names . You 're Mr. Glitch , former advisor to the queen herself . Mr. Raw , a viewer of extraordinary skill . And you , Mr. Cain , you were a tin man on the Mystic Man 's protection detail . You 're all quite famous in the O.Z. And , uh ... quite in demand . Dead or alive . That is a terrible picture of me . ( Both ) Mm . Now , look , I 'm sorry if I scared any of you back there , but there 's never really a great time for the old beast-into-man moment . You just ... Wham ! .. and hope for the best . I don 't know . You 're still a stranger . Am I ? Let 's just see about that . Hey , that 's mine . It was yours when you were a child . Whoa . Am I really doing this ? ( Dog ) Indeed you are . Magic 's in your blood . Let it shed light on your past so that you may better face your future . Now , concentrate , DG . Concentrate . Concentrate , DG . You must let the light flow through you effortlessly . Remember , light as air . Toto ... It 's Tutor . Now , focus . I am , but this thing won 't float ! It will . It wants to . Just concentrate , Deej . Yes ! Yes ! Toto . You were our tutor . Before you were sent over to the other side , your mother put a spell on all of your memories , in case you were ever taken into the wrong hands . So I 've been told . Well , she sent me now to help you reawaken the memories you 'll need to find the gray gale , and the emerald of the eclipse . Wait , how did you see her if she 's in Azkadellia 's prison ? She came to me in a dream . But she 's growing weaker and weaker . There 's no time to waste . Mystic Man said to head south . Then that 's exactly what we should do . Don 't you think , Cain ? South ? Yes , that 's ... that 's what I meant . Excuse me . South . Unfortunately , the only road to the south leads through the fields of the pa-pay . Pa-pay ... ( Growls ) I should kill you ! Shh ! She 's in conference . ( Whispering ) And I will . I will ... My men just told me that Wyatt Cain is alive . He was here . If she finds out ... ( Azkadellia ) Finds out what ? That you 're utterly incapable of putting one man in his grave ? I shot him out a window into a freezing lake . The man has nine lives . He 's not the only one . Xora ... Huh . That 's my girl . She 's heading south . My men will blitz the area immediately . No , they won 't . You have them dead to rights , and you don 't want to take her ? No . I want her to lead me straight to the emerald . You planted a spy . Just keeping an eye on her , as any concerned big sister would . I want you to shadow her . Don 't get too close . Think you can handle a little restraint , Zero ? ( Distant screech ) ( Glitch ) That can 't be good . ( Cain ) Hunter parties are out . Stay sharp . ( DG ) Did it always look so dead ? No , this used to be some of the most fertile land in the O.Z. Orchards , nurseries . Got to love a good orchard . Full of succulent fruit for all the people to eat . Free , too , if you 're a good fence-climber . Mind you , those scarecrows kind of freak me out . So , what happened ? Well , about 15 annuals ago , all the crops died , which then caused a great famine . I bet I can guess who 's responsible . Yeah . You 'd think somebody would have helped them with their crops , maybe ... engineered a doohickey with a couple of ... thingies ... Got to love a good orchard . Pa-pay once peaceful . Yeah ? Well , now the only peace they 're interested in is a piece of us ! Were farmers . Now hunters . No wonder they 're desperate . They don 't have any food ... ( Screeching ) Shh , shh ! Runner scouts . They 're signaling to the others . ( Snarling ) Run ! Ah ! ( Gun clicks ) ( Clicking ) ( Screeching ) Good boys . DG ! ( Snarling ) It 's almost dinner time . ( Shrieks ) DG ... Use your gift . To do what ? Focus , DG . You 've got it in you . Come on . I don 't know how . Just focus . ( Shrieking ) It isn 't working . Why are they bowing ? Thanking us . ( Creaking ) Look ! That is one heck of a defense , kid . Good , DG . Let 's get out of here . Come on . Easy ... Thank you . Come on . Let 's go , let 's go . ( Shrieking ) ( Clink ) ( Sobbing ) ( Crying ) Oh ... DG , my darling . You 're shaking like a leaf . What 's wrong ? Az . She fell , and I let go . Oh , what are you talking about ? There 's Az right there . ( Gasps ) ( Whispering echoes ) ( Whispering ) You OK ? Yeah . It looked like you were having a nightmare , a bad one . DG dream of Azkadellia . Yeah . She told me once that we were friends when we were little , and I didn 't believe her , but now I 'm not so sure . Maybe your dream 's trying to tell you something . In my dream , I 'm scared and my mother is rocking me on a swing ... in a special place . A beautiful place by a lake . Well , there 's about a hundred lakes just south of here . DG know which lake . No , I don 't . You do , DG . Because you were there before , as a little girl . Try . What was it like ? It was ... ( Girls singing ) ♪ Two little princesses dancing in a row ♪ Spinning fast and freely on their little toes ♪ Where the light will take them they will never ... ♪ Magical . Well ... to get to lake country , we have to cut across the crack in the O.Z. This ain 't going to be easy . ( Shrieks ) I brought you a gift . Bulgar novi . Once extinct in the fields of the pa-pay . ( Inhales ) Oh ! I thought I 'd never enjoy their fragrance again . I suppose some things thought dead aren 't always so . Save the poetry for someone who cares . What do you want ? The little witch is reconnecting with her past . Then hope lives . And what about you , Azkadellia ? Perhaps DG isn 't the only one who needs to unlock her memories . I 'm only concerned with the future . Then why are you here talking to me ? Why have you locked me away for all these years , kept my hope alive ? To see your face ... the day that hope dies . ( Glitch ) Can 't we rest ? I 'm tired . ( Tutor ) No time . We have to get to Finaqua . ( Sniffs ) Ew ... I 'd give my last synapse for a juicy apple . Apples ... ( Tutor ) What is it ? Something Azkadellia said . ( Azkadellia ) We 'd explore the woods , gather apples ... Clever how you tricked that old tree to throw fruit at us . I heard tell of it once in a story from the past . We should get back before mother realizes we 're gone , or we 'll be history , too . We are not supposed to be out here alone . She says there 's wild animals in the forest . Did she say what kind of wild animals ? Lions and tigers , and ... ( Growls ) Oh , my ! ( Roaring ) Az ! Just hold my hand , Deej ! Nothing can hurt us if we stay together ! ( Roaring ) ( Sighs ) Azkadellia , what happened to you ? Hey , kiddo ... are you coming ? Yeah . They won 't be puttin ' a zipper on that gaper . ( Raw ) Longcoats everywhere . Yeah , we 're not getting past them in broad daylight . The eclipse is almost upon us . We don 't have any time to waste . Look , quick and dead might be OK with you , dogman , but I 'll take slow and breathing any time . Even then , we 're going to need some help . Cabin . ( Glitch ) Probably full of Longcoats . No . Look at the smoke . So they lit a fire . Longcoats get cold , too . It 's blue . Come on . ( Clicking ) State your business . We mean you no harm . We 're travelers of the realms seeking a warm meal and a cold cup of grog . Food is scarce this time of year , and the grog has long since been seized . Then we will leave you in peace . May your hearth be warm . And your smoke be blue . Come in , quickly . Thank you ... for your help . I 'm Ralph . That 's my wife , Lorraine . Put your gun on the table . They 're friends , Lorraine . No such thing anymore . It 's OK . We just need shelter till it 's safe to cross . ( Ralph ) It 's never safe . But the cover of night will help . Until then , sit , rest . Get back in there ! Please . Let us show some trust . It 's all right , children . Come out . Hey , there . Is nobody else hungry but me ? Yes . We 'll eat . Children , help your mother . Please , my love . Come . Come . Please excuse my wife . We 've lived in fear for too long . What news from the resistance in the east ? Well , I was hoping that you would tell us . Do you know anything about a machine that Azkadellia 's building ? Only rumors . We helped a captain from the lowlands . All he said was that Azkadellia was pushing the miners and the metalworkers till they dropped . What mine ? Some mine in the Black Mountains . Mauritanium . Big M , little T. Number 216 in the Ozian periodic table . ( Laughs ) School days . I remember a lovely lass named Leona ... Mauritanium . What 's it for ? Besides its strength , Mauritanium is valued for its ability to conduct magical energy . So if she gets ahold of the emerald , she can focus the power however she wants . Not if we get to it first . So it 's a weapon . No , it 's a sunseeder . What 's a sunseeder ? I don 't know , but it sounds cool . Oh , wait ... I invented it . What 's it used for ? I can 't remember . I 'm sorry , we don 't have time for this . We have to know . Raw ? Calibrating the sequencing is a delicate process . Will it work ? It will work perfectly , Sorceress . You have planned well , and nothing will stand in your way . I know . Um ... I 'm not so sure about all this . Glitch ... If Azkadellia 's building a machine that you designed , you might be the key to stopping her . I am talking about Fluffy diving into my cranium . Invasion of my privacy and all ... Dark day . ( Gasps ) Majesty , I bring bad news . The princess Azkadellia has seized Central City . ( Queen ) Have our men pull back . Set up positions to the south . Uh ... What ? The fourth brigade has fallen . General Lonot has defected . He was our most loyal friend . I 'm so sorry . There is no law other than Azkadellia 's . She tried to steal the plans for the sunseeder . But I was able to destroy the blueprints . She 'll come after you , Ambrose . Is there nothing you can do , Majesty ? Too late . The darkness is too deeply rooted in her . But your light . You are the most powerful being in all of the O.Z. Was , old friend . I gave my power and my light to save someone very special . My angel ... Show some respect . The queen 's reign ends today . Do you have any idea what you are doing ? I do . You need a long rest , Mother . Take her away , and take him to the alchemist . If you won 't tell me what you know , I guess I 'll just have to reach in and take it myself . Remove the brain slowly . No ... Please don 't ... don 't do this . Please , it won 't ... it won 't work . Please . ( Alchemist ) Count back from 100 . ( Glitch ) Please ... Please ! 99 ... Don 't do it . Don 't ... 98 ... 97 ... 96 ... ( Gasping ) Oh , my ... ( Chuckles ) Uh , the name 's Glitch , have we ... Are you OK ? Yes , Glitch , I 'm fine . What ? Was my machine so bad ? No . But whatever it is , you sure sacrificed a lot to stop Azkadellia . That 's why she had to go straight to the source . Oh , I guess it wasn 't the biggest sacrifice ever made for science . But it sure is up there . The time to go is now . Full dark and the moons have yet to rise . You OK ? ( Sniffs ) I 'm disappointed in myself . My mother gave up her power to bring me back to life , and that 's how Azkadellia was able to take over . You know , kiddo ... there are some things in life that are just ... out of our control . But we need you . You got to let it go . Come on . Where did you get this ? We should go . Where did you get this ? A resistance fighter made it for my son . He came through a few months back with his mother . I think their names ... Jeb ... and Adora . My family . They really are alive . You 're a lot like her , you know . She wasn 't always all ermine robes and " thees " and " thous " . She started out just like you . Feisty but fair . My mother 's done so much for me , and I don 't even know her name . Oh ! Well , that 's easy . Her name was Queen ... It 's OK . But she was happy to make the sacrifices she thought were right . We should all love someone that much . Come on . Quickly . Help me with this . Come on . We hide it as best we can . Good . Clear it all . There is not much time . Your family crossed this same line , friend . Said they were headed to an old cabin about three spans on the other side , tucked behind a giant white elm , the only one there . Thank you . We should thank you . All right , come on . I 'm too big for that thing . ( Whines ) Did I ever tell you I was afraid of heights ? You were hanging from the ceiling when I met you . Involuntarily ! ( Toto whines ) If you shape-shift , I swear I 'll drop you . Ow ! You OK ? Yeah . All right , let 's go . Where are we headed ? There . That 's it . That 's where my family made their new home . I really don 't think there 's time for this . He 's always made time for us . ( Grunts ) Adora ! Jeb ! Adora ! Jeb ... They crossed the gorge . Why continue south ? Nothing there but wasteland and ... Finaqua . That 's the first place you searched for the emerald , years ago . It seems the light is helping the pure of heart . Zero awaits your orders . Should he ride to Finaqua ? No . And tell him not to get too close . Your son , Jeb , still lives . No . He lives to honor you . I feel it . You feel too much . Come on , let 's get a move on . You 've sent her into the heart of darkness , Mother . Why Finaqua ? She needs to know what she 's up against . Which way now ? Well , both ways head south . Your mother said your memories would guide you , DG . Let them . I don 't know , it looks familiar . Well , dig deeper . Remember , DG . I remember ... her swinging me on a swing , and the suns reflecting in my eyes , and the breeze off the water . Glitch ! Oh , what 's that ? No ! ( Shrieking ) ( Gasps ) ( Gunshot ) ( Shrieking ) Sorceress ! Water . Water ... Right away . Xora ? What happened ? Little beastie just came out of nowhere . Why did it attack now ? Probably a random hit . It 's dead now . Great . We should just move along like it never happened . ( Cain ) Never happened ? Once Az finds out that this one 's missing , she 's going to have Longcoats crawling all over the Zone looking for it . All the more reason to get moving . You OK ? You 're sweating up a storm . I 'm fine . ( Shrieking ) I know . Come on ! ( Glitch ) What is this ? ( Tutor ) She 's found something . ( Cain ) Come on . This way , come on . DG ! Where are we ? DG ! This way . DG ? Where is she ? I just saw her . Where ? DG ! Come on , come on . You were right about the magical waters , DG . That 's what Finaqua means in the ancients ' language . Not sure about the translation now though . This used to be paradise . ( Raw ) Not paradise now . ( Cain ) It was one of the first places Az scorched when she came to power . ( Tutor ) Well , she sure didn 't leave much . No . ( Girl ) Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble ... trouble ... trouble ... trouble ... What was that ? ( Tutor ) Wait , guys , let her do this alone . ♪ Two little princesses dancing in a row ♪ Spinning fast and freely on their little toes ♪ Where the light will take them , they will never know ♪ ( Distant scream ) Did you hear that ? Hear what ? Let 's go see what it is . No , we should get back . Mom said to stay close . If we did everything Mom said , we 'd never have any fun . Come on , it 's like an adventure .

It 's the picture language of the ancients . Can you tell what it means ? Some . At the dawn of time , good battled evil , and the light conquered over the darkness . And something about an evil witch ... Well ... that was fun . Wait . ( Gasps ) Whoa ! What is this place ? It looks ancient . Maybe it 's a tomb . I 'm not sure , but that face creeps me out . Let 's go . Don 't you hear it ? ( Sobbing and wailing ) There 's someone trapped in there . ( Screams ) DG ! ( Rumbling ) ( Explosion ) ( Screaming ) ( Wailing ) ( Azkadellia ) What have we done ? ( Crying ) ( Sobbing ) Hey , are you OK ? ( Sobbing continues ) No , wait . How did you get here ? Help me ! ( Sobs ) Our parents aren 't far . We 'll go and bring back help . No !

Azkadellia , are you all right ? Of course , Mother . I 've never felt better . Oh ! ( Sobs ) I 'm sorry , my sister . All the terrible things that have happened , they were all my fault . I should never have let go . Excuse the interruption , Sorceress , but without Xora 's reports , Zero would like to know if you 'd wish him to pick up the trail . I will pick up the trail myself . Find her . ( Mobats shrieking )

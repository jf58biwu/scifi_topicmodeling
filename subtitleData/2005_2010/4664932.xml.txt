 Something wasn 't right . that 's how I felt . there was a match between two teams that I had never heard of before I felt compelled to cheer for the losing team . check timing please ~ } the phone . You don 't have to tell me . I know . right ? We 're all meeting in front of the station at exactly 2 o 'clock . Make sure you come ! I didn 't even get to say a thing . What ? I forgot to tell you what to bring . Bring your swimming gear and lots of money ! And make sure you come on a bike . Over ! Huh ? I have this feeling that I knew exactly what Haruhi was going to say . { Nazo note : changed to make narrative more present tense } that 's not right . it feels like the same thing happened not too long ago . Is this what you call déjà vu ? huh ? 600 ) } Endless Eight Kyon ! You need to show more enthusiasm ! yeah . Sorry for making you guys wait . I just got here too . let 's go ! Where are we going ? of course ! so I guess we would . we should have summer activities like what people do in the summer ! you know . That 's why we 're doing this now ! This is our once-in-a-lifetime freshman summer vacation ! we 're going to the pool by bike . You guys brought yours too ? you and I are the only ones who brought bikes . { Nazo : Added " No " } Kyon ? You can 't lose to Koizumi-kun . { Nazo : Added " You got it " } take off ! Charge ! No ESP ! you two ! Kyon ! We came here to have fun ! Why 're you acting so worn out already ? Just whose fault do you think that is ? Whose ? ! the smell of chlorine ! This is what it 's all about ! Hurry up and come ! The water is nice and warm ! Can 't she read the signs that say " No Diving " ? It looks like fun . Don 't you think Suzumiya-san may have found a normal way of enjoying things ? there shouldn 't be anything happening that will endanger the world . I wish that were true ... What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's probably just my imagination . Let us get ready to go in too . It 's bitter ! One more cup ! I feel like I 've seen this scene somewhere before . Nagato seems to be bored . Kyon ! That 's right . Then Haruhi said something like ... These two are my brigade members . They 'll listen to everything I say . So ask them anything ! Come let 's go have fun ! We 're going to play water dodgeball ! sure ... I guess déjà vu happens all the time . but ... What do you think ? What 's this ? It 's our plan for how to pass what little remains of summer vacation ! When I suddenly realized that there were only two weeks of summer vacation left I was horrified ! It just feels like there 's still so much to do . we don 't have any time left . From now on we 're going all out ! We 're doing all this in less than 2 weeks ... do you have anything you want to do ? I would like to scoop up goldfish . Okay . Goldfish ... scooping ! Excuse me . Thanks . So we 're all set for tomorrow ! I wonder if there 's an Obon festival being held near here . A fireworks show would be nice too . I 'll look into it . I 'll contact you later on . Don 't forget the goldfish scooping ! after all . Understood . that 's it for today ! Later ! Me too . Nagato . but ... How have you been feeling lately ? Been doing fine ? I 'm fine . That 's great . What was that ... ? Why did I call out to her exactly ? huh ? There really are a lot of people here . That stage ... That food stall ... but I feel like I 've been here recently . Mikuru-chan ! There 's the goldfish scooping you wanted to do ! Let 's catch a ton ! Shall we do the same ? Perhaps a little competition ? Forget it . do you want to get something to eat ? You 're interested in these things ? Which do you want ? It 's fine . I want this . Sure ! 800 yen . but ... Thirteen fish ! We got a big catch today ! I just took one . check timing please ~ } I 'll let you have it . Thanks . check timing please ~ } I bought it . Oh ... really . Sign : Disruptive Fireworks Not Allowed it was summer vacation . I wish I could forget the one thing that I haven 't done yet . have you finished your homework ? What 's with you ? You can do all of that in three days . Three days ? ! then knock yourself out with fun . Why the hell is this girl so smart ? The distribution of attributes is pretty random . Everyone ! Tomorrow we will be going bug catching ! The one who catches the most bugs will ... Let 's see get to be the Brigade Leader for the day ! thanks . That sounds like fun . Will any bug do ? umm ... Cicadas only ! That 's right . It 'll be the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition ! The next day was ridiculously nice . we held the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition . That 's not a cicada . apparently they 're found in Okinawa and are a national protected species . } but ... the winner was Haruhi . We should go with a " catch-and-release " mentality after all . they might repay us with a favor in the future . What can a cicada do for us anyway ? Back to the mountains with you ! I felt like I was Pandora . W-Welcome ! we were gathered for some random reason given a bunch of random frog costumes to wear and ended up handing out balloons in front of a supermarket as a part-time job . Now I know what it must have felt like when Unit 0 got hit by that beam ! Thanks for your work everyone ! What 's with the greeting anyway ? Good job ! The manager was really grateful ! I don 't need the old man 's gratitude . Where 's our pay ? This is it . What ? I 've wanted this for a while now ! You made us do all that work just for the sake of getting that ? ! Let 's decorate the clubroom with this in commemoration ! just wear it whenever you feel like it . I give you permission ! Yes ! Eh ... What ? Nah . Nothing . Don 't look over here . Mikuru-chan ! It 's fine ! Really ! Your ice cream 's going to fall . That night . My slumber was once again stolen by none other than a phone call . The number you have dialed is currently un ... Eh ! ? What the ... Kyon-kun ... Asahina-san ? it 's me . Something bad has ... If this goes on ... I 'll ... Hello ? Koizumi . Why are you together with Asahina-san at this hour ? A slight problem has occurred . Do you think you could come right now ? Asahina-san ? Kyon-kun ... I ... I can 't go back to the future ! it 's like this . We are currently looping through the same time period over and over again . you said that quite cheerfully . do you have any idea what you 're saying ? I do . There 's nothing more to it . I was talking to Asahina-san just now . Call me for a meeting too ! I happened to notice that the flow of time lately has felt strange . I guess you can say Asahina-san was the one that discovered it . I was able to confirm something . Confirm what ? We 've experienced a repeat of the same time period many times already . You told me that already . it 's from August 17th to August 31st . We 're caged up in an endless summer vacation . It certainly is summer vacation now . endless summer . The world now has lost all its time after September 1st . Who the hell would believe that ? would believe it . I 'll give you an explanation too ... I use * classified information * to communicate with the future and have done * classified information * . so it was strange . That 's what I thought ... And then * classified information * . so I tried a * classified information * but it was completely * classified information * . What should I ... Are we shut inside something similar to an enclosed space ? that 's not the case . One part of the time continuum has just been cut off . everything will be reset at exactly 2400 hours and we will return to August the 17th again . That 's the process . the entire human race 's memories ? gets reset . Everything starts over from the beginning again . huh ? since people from the future are involved with this . Nope . This has nothing to do with Asahina-san . Then what 's the reason ? Probably Suzumiya-san . She might be unaware of it herself check timing please ~ } What the hell ? Does she have some sort of regret ? I believe so . It may very well be the fact that she feels like she still has something to do during the summer . but ... You look like you 're having fun . I 've finally managed to solve the riddle of the déjà vu being left as imprints from past loops . I 've come to understand that the imprints are the remains of a memory reset . Don 't tell me everyone in the world feels it too . It doesn 't seem like it . You and I are special cases . Just by being people who are close to Suzumiya-san we 've become the only people capable of feeling this . What about Haruhi ? Isn 't she at least aware of this herself ? It doesn 't look like it at all . Things would probably be a lot more complicated if she were . I 'm thinking that there must be someone who has retained all of his or her memories of the repeated time . Is it true ? Yes . check timing please ~ } Yes . how many times have we been " reset " ? five hundred and twenty-first time . 521 ? 521 ? Are you serious ? Yes . So we did the same things over and over again each and every one of those times ? That is not necessarily the case . 521 times 391 of those times . we went twice . Obon minus the goldfish catching occurred 437 times . 048 times . there have been six variations ... Besides distributing balloons answered calls ... that 's enough . 521 times . That 's what Nagato said . about 595 years . living it over and over again while retaining her memories ? just how does it feel to have lived through all this ? I 'm thinking about ridiculous things again ... I wonder if they 're there ? What are ? Martians . I don 't really want them to be there . There doesn 't seem to be anyone on the surface . They might just be a timid people that live underground . The day humans first set foot on Mars they 'll definitely come out of their caves and welcome them as a surprise . They 'll say " Welcome to Mars ! " or something . I 'd prefer a normal welcome . this is boring . Let 's look for UFOs ! The next day was stargazing . The venue was Nagato 's apartment . Koizumi prepared the telescope . anyway ? I wonder . this problem would be relatively straightforward to solve . Why don 't we try this out for starters ? Suddenly hug Suzumiya-san from behind and whisper into her ear : " I love you " . And who 's doing that ? I wonder if there 's anyone more suitable than you . But I refuse . Shall I do it instead then ? I 'm kidding . I 'm not qualified for that role . I would only put Suzumiya-san into an unnecessary state of confusion . Nagato . right ? Yes . Then why did you keep quiet about it ? Because my mission is to observe . SOS Brigade Test of Courage - Put your doll on this checkpoint as evidence ! I see . The queue of vigorous summer vacation events continued . We went to a real fireworks show . too . please leave the vicinity quickly . Other activities included : the batting center going to the movies swimming in the sea bowling and karaoke . We completed every single activity without exception . I knew that this still wouldn 't satisfy Haruhi yet I didn 't make an effort to do something about it . the remaining days of summer ... drained away realistically . it was already August 30th . we 've pretty much completed our summer plans . Don 't scribble on that ! I wonder if it 's okay like this ? But ... I guess that 's it . do any of you want to do anything else ? fine then . so it 's probably enough . it 's not . You aren 't supposed to be satisfied yet . let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . just take a good rest until then . Let 's meet in the clubroom the day after tomorrow . Haruhi ! let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . just take a good rest until then . Let 's meet in the clubroom the day after tomorrow . Haruhi ! I can 't let Haruhi go home like this . all those ten thousand something weeks will just end up being repeated again ! let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . just take a good rest until then . Let 's meet in the clubroom the day after tomorrow . But what should I do ? What should I say ? There should be hints in Haruhi 's words ! But what are they ? What did she say until now ? ! I don 't know . I can 't remember ... let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . just take a good rest until then . Let 's meet in the clubroom the day after tomorrow . It 's useless . August 31st . Homework : unfinished . I don 't care anymore . doing this homework would be meaningless . I 'll just leave it to myself to figure it out then .

 Strange . Strange . Strange . Something wasn 't right . that 's how I felt . I felt compelled to cheer for the losing team . I had the feeling that Haruhi was about to cause a commotion again . the phone . You don 't have to tell me . I know . right ? We 're all meeting in front of the station at exactly 2 o 'clock . Make sure you come ! I didn 't even get to say a thing . What ? I forgot to tell you what to bring . Bring your swimming gear and lots of money ! And make sure you come on a bike . Over ! See ? No chance at all . I had the feeling that I knew exactly what Haruhi was going to say . that 's not right . it felt like the same thing happened not too long ago . déjà vu ? huh . 600 ) } Endless Eight Kyon ! You need to show more enthusiasm ! yeah . Sorry for making you guys wait . I just got here too . let 's go ! Where to ? of course ! so I guess we would . we should have summer activities like what people do in the summer ! you know ? That 's why we 're doing this now ! This is our once-in-a-lifetime freshman summer vacation ! we 're going to the pool by bike . You guys brought yours too ? you and I are the only ones who brought bikes . Kyon ? You can 't lose to Koizumi-kun . take off ! Charge ! you two ! Hurry up and park your bikes ! Kyon ! We came here to have fun ! Why 're you acting so worn out already ? Just whose fault do you think that is ? Whose ? ! the smell of chlorine ! This is what it 's all about ! let 's swim ! It 's a race ! A race ! wait ! It looks like fun . Indeed it does . isn 't it ? And really peaceful too . Don 't you think Suzumiya-san may have found a normal way of enjoying things ? Is inviting people by calling them up all of a sudden and then hanging up after stating her one-sided demands ... considered " normal " ? From my perspective something that minor isn 't a big deal at all . Seeing as she 's having so much fun there shouldn 't be anything happening that will endanger the world . If only that were true ... What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's probably just my imagination . We 've been through a lot since spring . I think I might have become a little neurotic . I lost again ! let 's compete one more time ! { think Yuki 's body is far more streamlined . Just saying ) - put this in the release ! XD } Here I come ! Tashty ! Thish ish so goof ! this should be a " pool for the masses " instead of a " pool for the public " . Why would Haruhi choose a place like this ? this should be a " pool for the masses " instead of a " pool for the public " . Why would Haruhi choose a place like this ? It 's this feeling again . That 's right . Then Haruhi said something like ... so maybe double typset them ? } so maybe double typset them ? } so maybe double typset them ? } Now let 's go have fun ! We 're going to play water soccer . okay . I guess déjà vu happens all the time . What 's this ? This is our activity program for spending what 's left of summer . When I suddenly realized that there are only two weeks left of summer ... we 're going all out ! We 're doing all of this in less than 2 weeks ... do you have anything you want to do ? I would like to scoop up goldfish . Okay . Goldfish ... scooping . Excuse me a moment . Thanks . Done already ? Yes . we 're starting tomorrow ! I wonder if there 's an Obon festival being held near here . A fireworks show would be nice too . I 'll look into it . Don 't forget the goldfish scooping ! Understood . So I 'm the one paying again ... You 're dismissed for today ! Later ! Me too . Nagato ! but ... How have you been feeling lately ? Been doing fine ? I 'm fine . That 's great . Yes . S-Sorry for calling out and stopping you . Sorry . Why ... Why did I call out to her ? 360 ) \ fscx40 \ fscy40 \ bord0 \ shad0 \ frz347 } Remove Bicycles from Haruhi . Apparently they had found the location of an Obon festival . apparently . Kyon ! You 're dead last today too ! Jeez . Whatever . Let 's go to buy yukatas ! and then briskly proceeded to drag them into the changing rooms . the three of them finally returned . What do you think ? isn 't she ? You girls look great . after all . Especially Mikuru-chan ! You 're too cute ! You 're way too cute ! Just what I 'd expect from myself ! turn around ! Turn around ! Ah ! Awesome ! Yeah ! The summer is great ! huh ? There 's quite a crowd here . Wait . There it is again . Again ... What 's with this feeling ? they have the goldfish scooping that you wanted to do ! { Nazo : Changed the order here just because " Mikuru-chan ! " breaks him out of his thoughts } Let 's scoop non-stop ! Okay ! Shall we do the same ? How about a competition ? Forget it . do you want to get something to eat ? you 're interested in these things ? Which one ? It 's fine . This one . Sure ! That 'll be 800 yen . but ... Thirteen fish ! we just took one fish each . { Nazo : I added " each " since both Haruhi and Mikuru are holding one each } That 's great . I 'll let you have it . Thanks . What 's with the mask ? I bought it . Oh ... really . Right ! Fireworks are next ! We 'll finish today off with that ! you get summer vacation . but there was one thing bothering me . { Not sure what Kyon says in the background . Astro thinks it 's " Let 's get them all ! " } All right ! We 'll go bug catching tomorrow . but have you finished your homework ? What 's with you ? You can do all of that in three days . I don 't think people will be able to tell it 's English because of his accent . - Ky } Just get rid of the troublesome stuff and then knock yourself out with fun . That 's the right way to enjoy summer vacation ! Why the hell is this girl so smart ? The distribution of attribute points is pretty random . Therefore ! Tomorrow we will be going bug catching ! The one who catches the most bugs will ... Let 's see get to be the Brigade Leader for the day ! thanks . That sounds like fun . Will any bug do ? umm ... Cicadas only ! That 's right . It 'll be the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition ! The next day was ridiculously nice . we held the SOS Brigade Cicada Catching Competition . but ... the winner was Haruhi . We should go with a " catch-and-release " mentality after all . they might return the favor in the future . What can a cicada do for us exactly ? Back to the mountains with you ! I felt like I was Pandora . W-Welcome ! and ended up doing some part time work at a supermarket . everyone ! What 's with that cheerfulness of hers ? Good job ! The manager was really grateful ! I don 't need the old man 's gratitude . Where 's our pay ? It 's right there . the costume is not next to haruhi } He said he 'd give it to us because of Mikuru-chan ! You made us do all that work just for the sake of getting that ? ! Let 's decorate the clubroom with it in commeration ! just wear it whenever you feel like it . I give you permission ! That night . stolen by none other than a phone call . Kyon-kun ... Asahina-san ? it 's me . Something bad has ... If this goes on ... I 'll ... Waaa am I gonna do ... Uh ... Koizumi . Why are you together with Asahina-san at this hour ? A slight problem has occurred . Do you think you could come right now ? You bastard . Bastard ! Asahina-san ? Kyon-kun ... I ... can 't go back to the future ! I don 't get it . it 's like this . We are currently looping through the same time period over and over again . { Nazo : Goddamnit .. I missed adding " period " last QC ... } you said that quite cheerfully . do you have any idea what you 're saying ? I do . There 's nothing more to it . I was talking to Asahina-san just now . Call me for a meeting too ! And you don 't need to come ! I happened to notice that the flow of time lately has felt strange . I guess you can say Asahina-san was the one that discovered it . I was able to confirm something . Confirm what ? We 've experienced a repeat of the same time period many times already . You told me that already . it 's from August 17th to August 31st . We 're caged up in an endless summer vacation . It certainly is summer vacation now . endless summer . The world now has lost all its time after September 1st . Who the hell would believe that ? would believe it . Are we inside something similar to an enclosed space ? that 's not the case . I believe so } everything will be reset at exactly 2400 hours and we will return to August the 17th again . That 's the process . I missed changing " whole " to " entire " in last QC } gets reset . Everything starts over from the beginning again . huh ? since people from the future are involved in this . Nope . This one has nothing to do with Asahina-san . Then what 's the reason ? Probably Suzumiya-san . She might be unaware of it herself but there might be a part of her that thinks : " I don 't want summer to end ! What the hell ? Does she have some sort of regret ? I believe so . It may very well be the fact that she feels like she still has something to do during the summer . meaningless issue into galactic proportions . So what do you want me to do ? I would have already resolved it . but ... You look like you 're having fun . aren 't you ? I 've finally figured out the reason behind the feelings of déjà vu we 've been having . { I changed this line on purpose from episodes 6 and earlier just for this ep . - Ky } I 've come to understand that the imprints are the remains of a memory reset . Don 't tell me everyone in the world feels it too . It doesn 't seem like it . You and I are special cases . What about Haruhi ? Isn 't she at least aware of this herself ? It doesn 't look like it at all . though . I 'm thinking that there must be someone who has retained all of his or her memories of the repeated time . And who would that be ? I think you 'll know without me having to say it . Is this true ? Yes . Do you remember everything ? Yes . how many times have we been " reset " ? and twenty-seventh time . 527 ? 527 ? Nagato ? Are you serious ? Yes . So we did the same things over and over again each and every one of those times ? That is not necessarily the case . 527 iterations 391 in which we did not go to the Obon festival . we went twice . Obon minus the goldfish catching occurred 437 times . 052 times . there have been six variations ... Besides distributing balloons distributed fliers ... That 's enough . Take care . 527 times . That 's what Nagato said . about 595 years . living it over and over again while retaining her memories ? just how does it feel to have lived through all this ? The next day was stargazing . The venue was Nagato 's apartment . Koizumi prepared the telescope . I wonder if they 're there ? What are ? Martians . I don 't really want them to be there . The day humans first set foot on Mars they 'll definitely come out of their caves and welcome them as a surprise . They 'll say " Welcome to Mars ! " or something . this is boring . Let 's look for UFOs ! anyway ? I wonder . this problem would be relatively straightforward to solve . Why don 't we try this out for starters ? Suddenly hug Suzumiya-san from behind I missed this last QC too ... . } And who 's doing that ? I wonder if there 's anyone more suitable than you . I love yo - ... No ! We 're too old for these games ! Shall I do it instead then ? I 'm just kidding . I 'm not qualified for that role . I would only put Suzumiya-san into an unnecessary state of confusion . we went to the batting center . Nagato . right ? Yes . Why did you keep quiet about it ? My mission is to observe . I see . The queue of vigorous summer vacation events continued . Fireworks . Fishing for gobies . A test of courage . Movie hopping and swimming in the sea . We were always on the move . yet I didn 't make an effort to do something about it . August 30th arrived . { Keep this one . I changed it from 6 - Ky . } we 've pretty much completed our summer plans . I wonder if it 's okay like this . But ... I guess that 's it . do any of you want to do anything else ? fine then . so it 's probably enough . it 's not . You aren 't supposed to be satisfied yet . let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . So just take a good rest until then . Let 's meet in the clubroom the day after tomorrow . Haru - let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . So just take a good rest until then . It 's this feeling again . It 's never been this strong before . I can 't let Haruhi go home like this . all those ten thousand something weeks will just end up being repeated again ! But what should I do ? There should be hints in Haruhi 's words ! But what are they ? What did she say until now ? ! I don 't know . I can 't remember ... 235 ) \ cH9CA79D \ bord0 \ shad0 } Impossible August 31st . Homework : unfinished . I don 't care anymore . happens . then doing this homework would be meaningless . I 'll just leave it to myself to figure it out then .

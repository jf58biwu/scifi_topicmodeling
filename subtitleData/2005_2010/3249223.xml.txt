 Torchwood - outside the government , beyond the police , fighting for the future on behalf ofthe human race . The 21st century is when everything changes ... and Torchwood is ready . # So who can you trust to transport your goods ? # Harwood 's ! You won 't be sorry with a Harwood 's lorry ! # # Good morning . Today sees an improvement on the weather ... Yeah , Ruth . Did you hear it ? I wrote the last bit . What sort of accident ? Yeah , I know it . I 'll get over there now . Stay back , please . You 'll have to move your car . I 'm Rhys Williams , manager of Harwood 's Haulage . You can check on the vehicle later . Bollocks ! I know the driver . Is he ... ? Didn 't make it . Sorry . Can you give me some details , sir ? It 's Leighton . Er ... Leighton Reynolds . Next of kin ? Yeah , he 's got a wife . Jen ... just had a baby , man . Do you know the address ? Yeah . 54 Keppoch Street , Roath . I give him a lift to football . Thank you , sir . Er , right . I 'm gonna need to arrange to move the lorry . Not yet . There 's something suspicious in the back . It 's just meat . Leighton was taking it to the abattoir . Yeah , well , Torchwood want to look at it first . Ugh ! Argh , it stinks ! No bones. just dense flesh . It 's not like any flesh I 've ever seen . What is it ? Well , as there haven 't been any giant cow sightings , I suggest we take a sample back to the Hub . We need to confiscate the contents of the van till we 've done further investigations . - Do you know where it came from ? - No , but it 's a Harwood 's lorry ... Oh , that 's Rhys 's firm . Right , done . Let 's go . Sorry , sir , you can 't come this way now . There 's evidence of a vertebral column but its genetic make-up isn 't compatible with any known animal . Any idea what it is ? - But whoever 's farming this meat knows it 's dodgy . See this ? Official vet stamp - ' fit for human consumption ' . It 's fake . It 's good , but it 's fake . Tosh , get onto the haulage firm . Find out where the meat is from . Why did it have to be Rhys 's firm ? It 's too close to home . to stand down ? what 's going on . Thank you , Ianto . # Harwood 's ! # You won 't be sorry with a Harwood 's lorry ! # Catchy . Do you think the haulage firm are in on it ? Rhys ? No . He just hires the vans out . Driver must have seen it loaded . That doesn 't implicate Rhys . He 's the most honest man I know . Have you got his direct line ? Harwood 's Haulage . How may I help you ? It 's the police . Hello ? Yes , speaking . Yes , I 'm aware ofthe accident . 'It 's a firm is called Harries and Harries . They came to us two months back . It 's a weekly contract . ' 'Are they licensed ? ' Of course ! Could you give me there address ? There 's no address here . There 's a pick-up point . They said it was hard to find . 'Hello , sorry . All I 've got is a service station on the Al â€¢ 70 , ' 15 miles from Cardiff . Do you have a contact number ? No , there 's no contact number , either . Can you tell me where your driver took the meat ? - yes , taking it to Caerwen Abattoir . 'It 's a processing plant . ' just general meat suppliers . What time did the driver leave base ? 'Signed out at ten to one . Can I ask what this is about ? ' I can 't release that information , sir . But I 'm the manager ... Brilliant ! Leighton was their regular . Apart from that first booking , they just went through him . Yes , but now it looks like I 'm hiding something . Got him ! There he is , coming back 40 minutes later . Let 's say it takes 20 minutes to load ... We are talking a ten-mile radius . jack ! Yeah ? The scan shows it 's definitely alien meat . Where would they get it from ? From the processing plant it 'll be going into pies , burgers , pasties - everything . Well , the DNA traces are stable . There are signs of animal sedative but no diseases or residues . My guess is it 's good to eat . Would YOU eat it ? Pizza 's arrived . I presumed it would be a late one . What did you get me ? Usual . Meat Feast . Lovely I 've narrowed it down to three potential areas . Only one warehouse is unoccupied , just outside Merthyr . Makes sense . Who knows what goes on there ? We have to shut the operation down , neutralise whoever 's doing this and identify the alien meat . Tosh , you co-ordinate . I have to slip home and check on Rhys . - Find out how much he knows . That 's not what I meant . I got your message . Are you all right ? Er ... bit of a tough day . Had an accident at work One of our lorries crashed . Anyone hurt ? Leighton . One of my drivers died . Oh , no ! Only 24 . Were you close ? For god 's sake , Gwen , you met him ! Small , dark hair , played five-a-side with me . Sorry . I can 't place him . Well , then I hear that the , er .. that the police have taken the meat out the back of the van . You any idea why ? How would I know ? You work for them I don 't deal in traffic accidents , so ... Well , they phoned the office and ... they asked loads of questions . Thing is , alll do is hire out the lorries , so I ... Then there 's nothing for you to worry about , is there ? Must be something dodgy going on , though . If there was , you weren 't to know . No , of course not . No . I wish I didn 't have to go back to work now . Hardly worth you coming home . Yes , it was . To see you . I 'm sorry . I 'll see you later . Go and have a pint . Call Daf . Yeah . Yeah , maybe I will . Like I thought He has no idea what 's going on . Would you care to accompany me to the slaughterhouse ? Have you ever eaten alien meat ? Yeah . What was it like ? He seemed to enjoy it 'lanto , Owen , we 're on our way . 'How are things looking at the slaughterhouse ? ' It 's all quiet . There 's a deserted access road . I 'll direct you in . ' Ianto , nearly there . Take the second turning . Park on the left . No-one will see the car there . There 's a main entrance at the front . It 's the only one open . The rest are padlocked and alarmed . How many are in there ? It 's difficult to tell , there are no windows . I have blueprints ofthe warehouse . The stock has to be in the central area . Having fun ? You don 't know what you 're missing . According to the sensor , there 's a heat signature across the entire building . That 's a lot of meat . Answer the phone , Gwen ! 'You two take the sides , Gwen and I will go in the front . ' We don 't want any casualties . We stun-gun whoever 's in there and put a stop to what they 're doing . Let 's go . There 's someone there . It 's Rhys . It 's Rh ... What 's he doing ? Did you bring the alarm de-activator ? Well , that 's one way of doing it . He must be in on it . Don 't bother running , mate . Greg ? We 've got a bit of a problem , bruv . How else do you explain that ? Ianto , Owen ... 'Stand down . Repeat , stand down . ' He told me he didn 't know what was going on . He wouldn 't lie to me . He also said he didn 't know where they were based . But he did . There 's something wrong . There has to be . Gwen ! No . No ! Come with me I just have to get him out . By charging in there ? What then ? You gonna knock them out ? Look , lads ... I don 't mean any harm , honestly . You can 't just go in there . You have to do as I say . We wait until he comes out . Boys , you should 've waited for the ketamine injection before doing that . What about the hoses ? That 's lidocaine . It 's not strong enough If you care so much , go and work for the RSPCA . Or don 't they pay as good ? Oi , you . Through here . Shift ! I want you and one of those with me , now ! Who sent you ? Come on . Don 't waste our time . No-one sent me . I came on my own . I 'm looking for the boss . You 're looking at him Ignore my little brother . I 'm , er ... I 'm from Harwood 's . Harwood 's Haulage . Leighton ... Er , Leighton , your driver ... um ... He sort of told me what was going on , like . Mouthy git ! He was paid to keep quiet . Ssh ! Yeah , well , he 's dead . Lorry crashed . With the goods inside ? Did anyone see the meat ? No , no , no . I ... er ... I picked it all up and took it all to be incinerated . You see , um ... I was hoping maybe I could pick up from where he left off , boys . How do we know you won 't report us ? I 'm here , aren 't I ? So what exactly did he tell you ? Everything . You know , that you were ... cleaning up old meat . Oh , it 's a lot bigger than that . What 's that noise ? What is it , boys ? No idea . But the beauty of it is , it just keeps growing . No matter how much we cut it . He 'll get used to it . I don 't get it . Come on . Let 's go . What were you doing at that warehouse ? You lied to me ! You were at the crash . What are you talking about ? You 're so used to fobbing me off like the idiot I obviously am ! I 'm asking the questions ! right ? I followed you , OK ? Yeah . So that bloke , the tall bloke in the coat . You fucking him or what ? All I ever asked was you trust me . Like you trust me ? There 's stuff you don 't understand . Oh , of course not . I 'm just a big , dumb animal , aren 't I ? I mean , what 's so secret you can 't even tell your own fiance ? Why ARE you marrying me ? What am I , a habit you can 't be arsed to break ? No . All right . My job ... the special ops thing ... it 's a lie - a cover story . Thank you ! At last ! God , what 's that taken ? About a year ? That 's one lie down . How many more ? Is there anything in your life based on truth ? Us . Us ? ! Us is falling to shit ! You think I enjoy keeping this stuff to myself ? Then why did you ? Because I 'm trying to protect you ! Have you ever stopped to think about that ? No ! You prefer to blunder in without thinking or looking . Good old ham-fisted Rhys . His heart is in the right place but his brain is a million miles fucking back . Come on , let 's have it all . What exactly do I need protecting from ? I catch aliens . Piss off ! You piss off ... If you won 't take it seriously ... This is why I couldn 't tell you because I hunt aliens and I scavenge the stuff they leave behind . Sometimes I don 't believe it . jesus Christ ! Have you been brainwashed ? Every word is the truth . Rhys ... The things I have seen ... The times I have wanted to tell you ... Aliens . In Cardiff . Have you never seen something so mad , so .. extraordinary ... .. that , just for one second , you think there might be more out there ? Prove it . Well , this is unprecedented - Mainly because we 're all sad and single . Speak for yourself . I am better off without all that kind of hassle . Maybe the answer is to go out with someone who knows what you do . Look around you , Tosh . Only we know what we do . I saw you here earlier . With him - that bloke . He appeared out of nowhere . It 's an invisible lift . Oh , it 's too complicated to explain . Come on . Trust me Ready ? Yeah . Wow ! Who 'd have thought this was here ? That looked so real . It was real . They 're extinct , Gwen . In your time line , yes . Captain Jack Harkness . Thanks for dropping in , Rhys This is the rest ofthe team . Owen and Toshiko. Ianto . Pleased to meet you . Welcome to our headquarters . It 's a bit bigger than mine . That 's right . A rift through space and time runs through Cardiff and stuff slips in from other time lines and planets . It 's ourjob to monitor it . Are you sure they 're not some kind of weird cult ? You saw that alien in the warehouse . Come on . What did you see ? Er ... It was this huge , shapeless beast , filling the space . A mound of flesh . So it 's one entity as opposed to several organisms . The tests reveal high levels of chloride , so it probably lives in the water . I reckon it came through the rift , into the sea and beached itself . Like a giant alien manatee . But how did they get it there ? That warehouse must be 50 metres long . Maybe it was smaller when they found it . They said it 's growing . It 's not dead ? No . It 's breathing . Its eye opened . So the protein chains regenerate despite the mutilation . Not only is it replenishing its own flesh but it 's increasing it , giving them a brand-new meat supply . It will last for years If we knew how it worked , we could feed the world . We could release a single . We 're talking about dodgy pies in Merthyr , OK ? And the fact that they 're cutting it up alive , which we could have put a stop to if it wasn 't for you . I thought my fiancee was in danger . Well , Mr Caveman , she wasn 't . She can handle herself . - Jack ... All you did tonight was mess things up . Now we have to think of a way to get back in and , thanks to you , they 'll have tightened security . Well , if you asked me what I saw in there , instead of showing off around the place ... Do I show off ? just a bit . .. you 'd know I got out by saying I wanted a job . So rather than cock things up , I 've found you a way to get in . But if you can 't handle that , big boy , then you can stuff it ! This is quite homo-erotic . No , no , no. jack , he is not getting us in . Team meeting . You , too . Jack ; That 's where the thing is . That 's the sedatives room . That 's where they pack the meat . That 's good to know . Yeah , but he 's not driving us in . They 're expecting me . You lot can hide in the back ofthe van . What is this ? Scooby-Doo ? ! No way is he getting involved . When you got involved , did you give me a thought ? Oh , joy A domestic . - Rhys is our best way in . Stun guns only . Why don 't we storm in , guns in the air , and arrest them ? They aren 't organised criminals . If we go in , guns blazing , they 'll kill the evidence and run . just waving . The last thing we need is a bloodbath . Point taken . I know that ... Once Rhys has loaded up , he can clear . You don 't have to come . You can stand down . It might be better . You love him . Makes you vulnerable . He 's not going in there without me . That 's your decision . Yes , it is . You both have to live by it . Come on . You and me - a team ! Damn it , Rhys ! This is for real . Do you understand ? This is for real ! And if you mess up , I will kill you ! So ... after we 've stun-gunned the workers , we put the creature out of its misery . No . We 're gonna save it . Stabilise it , wait for the rift to open and ... send it back . Guess who 'll have to look after it . How are we going to use it to arm ourselves against the future ? Hide behind it . Why shouldn 't we save it ? Because it 's an alien ? It needs our protection . You didn 't hear its cry . Heart-breaking . Listen to Ahab . Jack , it 's growing . Well , we 'll find a way to stop it mutating . Fine . I 'll stock up on plankton . So you do have a heart . We see enough death . What 's that ? Oh , it 's just an idea of what it looks like . I had it made up from the genetic make-up . It looks lovely . Mmm . You 're just a big softie , really , aren 't you ? I 'd better get on with that report . I brought you some sandwiches . Thanks , Tosh . It 's OK , just cheese and pickle . I can keep you company . I 'm not tired . In that case , maybe you can do it . I 'm knackered . That 's another big lump out of its habitat . Makes you realise , maybe it is possible to do this job and have a relationship . Do you fancy a game of pool sometime ? We 're always in here , slaving away . It might be nice to , I don 't know , kick back and have some fun . Yeah , why not ? When ? I 'll check with the others . We could have a Torchwood tournament . Thanks for the sandwiches , Tosh . I thought you were anti-terrorism . That was bad enough , but knowing you 're in this much danger Yeah , you 'd feel like I do now . Worried sick . You don 't have to do this to prove anything to me . I 'm not leaving you with all these sexy young men . There 's only one from where I 'm sitting . Sure about this ? Yeah . Cos once they ring , there 's no turning back . You just missed the advert . Yeah ? Here 's your tea . And I got you a Danish , your favourite . I 'm in the wrong job . We have got job vacancies . Maybe you could fit me in . I 'd be delighted to . Would I need a licence for trucking ? Yes . Takes four weeks , and then you can go long distance . That wouldn 't be a problem . It 's them . OK . Yeah , hello ? Why her ? Of all the women you could have chosen ... She chose us . Kinda stumbled upon us . So did I. Doubt you 'll be asking me to join . We needed someone with police skills . Could have chosen anyone . Did you ever think about us ? You know , me , her parents , people who love her , who want her safe ? No , I 'm sorry . We needed her . On her first day of work , she told me off for being too clinical . She doesn 't hold back , mind . Stubborn as hell . Tell me about it . Yeah , she 's an amazing girl . I 'm a lucky man , jack . Yeah , you said it . I just wish you were a bit uglier . Not gay , by any chance , are you ? Brought you a Danish , your favourite . I know what you 're like on an empty stomach . Cheers Get out as soon as you can , remember ? Yes , yes , yes . I love you . I love you , too . Now , stop fussing , and get in the back of the van . I 'll prepare a ketamine antidote so we can start weaning it off . Gwen , Tosh and I will take the main area . Owen , Ianto , cover the corridors and the small rooms . You OK ? What do you think ? He 'll be fine . He 's a good bloke . Let 's go . You couldn 't get us a cup of tea , could you ? Yes . Er ... just on there , mate . Here 's a oner for your trouble . Count it , if you like . When you get to the abattoir , ask for Graham . Him and the boys clean it up and process it . All right . Oh , my God ! It 's amazing ! How did it get here ? Imprisoned , chained and drugged . Welcome to planet Earth . It heard you . It 's sentient . Oh , that 's disgusting . What have they done to you ? What have they done to you , my poor friend ? Everyone ... they 're armed . Rhys . Gwen . Stay here . Where have you been ? That injection was due ten minutes ago . I needed more ketamine . I 've had to up the dose . The thing 's in agony . It 's meat . It can 't feel anything . You going soft , or what ? Get inside and play nurse , if you 're so bothered . We 've got work to do . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hang on . There 's only 12 bags in here He 's supposed to have three more . Come on , hurry up ! Hello . I have a ... thingy here somewhere ... Hell of a day . I should be getting off , mate .

You looking for someone ? How many more of you ? ! just us . You thought the two of you could take us out ? Nah , you 're not that stupid . Dave , get some ropes , tie their hands . I want every door locked , inside and out . Nobody leaves the building till this is sorted . Move it ! They 've got Rhys and Ianto . Gwen ! Gwen . Listen . Hey ! It will be OK . Locked . They must know we 're here . This way . What is it ? The lads call it the Cash Cow . Dale , what are you doing ? They couldn 't bear to see us making money . Fancied some for yourselves , eh ? Thought we 'd be a pushover ? Mate , you 're so out of your depth . Funny , I was just thinking the same about you . Dale , don 't be an idiot ! Show yourselves or I shoot the delivery boy ! OK ! There 's no need to make any threats . just the two of you , is it ? Gun down . I don 't have a gun . He had one , so you must have ! OK ! OK .

Shut up ! It 's an alien . A creature from another galaxy . No . No way . Did you really think it originated on this planet ? Have you ever seen anything like it before ? - It can 't be . Can it ? - Look at it . Look at it . It 's just meat , that 's all . You 're carving up a sentient creature , and y0u 've got to stop ! And then what have I got ? I 'm making money here ! This is my business . For the first time in my life , I 've actually got something for myself ! Dale , stop . You can still walk away from this . No . You lied to me . No ! No ! Die ! Shit ! Ianto ! Go ! After them ! Owen ! Rhys has been shot ! The creature 's coming loose - we need that sedative now ! Open your eyes . You can do this . Open your eyes now . Yeah , I 'm on it , I 'm on it . Owen , we need you ! The creature 's breaking free . If we try and get past , we 'll be crushed . It wasn 't me ! I never wanted to be a part of this ! Sedatives won 't work now . If it 's got loose , you 're never gonna stop it ! We 've gotta help them . It 's out of control . Change of plan . Come on ! Go , go ! Fill the other one . I 'm going as fast as I can . Pray they survive . Bloody hell ! I 'm sorry . He 's OK . Owen , you 're making it worse ! Open your eyes ! You can do it . Come on . It 's working . Yeah , it 's working . What did you do ? Mercy killing . Rhys , Rhys , listen to me , listen to me . That 's it , you 're with me , OK ? I 've got you tight . Keep your eyes nice and open . Gwen , let me look at him . OK . Soft , soft , soft . OK . I 'm going to rip this . I want you to keep the pressure on , OK ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . Here he is . Hero of the hour . Hey . Are you all right ? I 'am , | ' IOW you 6 | ' â‚¬ , y â‚¬ 6h . Mmm . Ah ! Sorry . Next time , let her take the bullet . Never . What happened to the blokes ? We gave them amnesia pills . They 'll remember who they are but not what they did over the past few months . It would never stand up in court . And the creature ? Incinerated . So there 's nothing left . It was never there Gwen , I need a word . Sure . Rhys has to forget too , you know ? At least let me give it to him at home . Let 's not go home just yet . Rhys , y0u 've just been shot . I know . Come on , lets go for an ice cream . Look around us . Nobody else knows what we 've been through . Or what else is out there . The sky won 't be the same to me any more . I used to look up and think , 'Ah , looks like rain , man . ' But now , oh , now I 'll ... I 'll look and I 'll think of all the other worlds and the planets and stuff spinning around out there . Oh ! And I got to be a part of it all ! Fantastic ! Which puts worrying about unsigned dockets into perspective , I can tell you . You 've got some ice cream on your chin . Have I ? Gone ? I want to know about all of it , about every alien you 've ever seen . You could take photos . I 'll keep a scrap book . Wouldn 't show no-one , no way . No , because you won 't be keeping one . And you know ... I 'm even cool about jack . All right , he 's handsome , enigmatic , saves the world and all that . But it 's me you come home to at the end of it all . And I always will . Hey . Daf ! All right ? Oh , nothing much . Same old , same old . Yeah ! What ? No way ! I won 't drug him . You have to . You can 't allow him to remember . It 's the rules . But none of you have any partners outside of this . But we understand how you feel . No , you don 't . No , you don 't , jack ! You all think it 's cold and lonely out there . And I 've lied to him for long enough . What he did today was so brave , braver than any of us because we signed up for this . But he didn 't ! He did it because he loves me , and I won 't take that away from him ! I won 't ! And if that means I have to quit or you retcon me or whatever , then fine , fine . You really think you could go back to your old life before Torchwood ? I wouldn 't know anything different . I would . Give Rhys my love , and I will see you tomorrow .

 Previously on Heroes . I think I found someone to fill Joseph 's shoes . How do I look ? Like everybody else . I 've never met you before . You pulled me from the 424 bus after it crashed at Lexington and 53rd . What made you become a paramedic ? I wanted to save lives instead of watching them pass . You 're exactly who I 'd hoped you 'd be . Hi . I need a file . Who 're you listening to ? I 'm talking to myself . Seriously , what are you ? A vampire ? An alien ? Some kind of freakish government experiment ? I saw this girl on YouTube . She was born with this gene that doesn 't let her feel any pain . I didn 't tell her . She just found out . Gretchen is not the enemy . She 's just a girl . And she 's the only friend that I 've made . This is my mess . And I 'm gonna clean it up . I 'm tired of keeping this secret to myself Do you want to be my roommate ? To closure . To closure . Had a little too much to drink ? On the ground . Hands behind your head . Down ! Now ! Mind your backs . Watch your back , will you ? Mrs. Corney 's unparalleled blueberry waffles . This is my favorite part of the day . SAMUEL it 's full of possibility . Before the inevitable monkey wrenches come looking for us . But more than anything , it 's about being with all of you . I know grace is a supper thing , but every morning I thank heaven and earth for our family . Sadly , Joseph 's death has left us an empty seat , a broken circle . But I feel like we 're on the way to mend it . There are lost lambs out there . They 're like us , but they 're hiding . Alone . Pretending to be that which they are not . It 's sad , pathetic . These people , they desperately need what we have . Understanding , unconditional love , family , trust . Who are we to deny anyone that ? Today is an important day for us , our family . And for one of them , too . Because by day 's end , we will have a full table again . Eat . Okay , I gotta ask . What 's with the ear-to-ear , smiley ? This ... This is cool . Drinking chocolate milk ? No . Me . In college . In a dining hall with my new college roommate . No snipers shooting at me . No serial killers hunting me . It 's e refreshing change of pace . Yeah . Tedium can be such a thrill . I have been chasing normal life forever and I finally caught it . I mean , don 't get me wrong , the chocolate milk is awesome , but right here , right now , is full of possibilities . I can be anyone . Claire Bennet , you can 't escape your destiny . I 'm Becky Taylor . Psi Alpha rush chair . Your mom Sandra 's sorority . Your mom was in a sorority ? She totally was . Hi , Becky . Hi . So , National has you on a list of legacies , but we haven 't heard from you about rush . I 'm not really sure I 'm a sorority girl . Neither was I at first . So , listen , open rush starts today at the house , why don 't you come by and meet the girls ? No strings . Yeah . Why not ? She 's gonna have to pass . Well , great , I 'll see you there . Thanks . Isn 't this what we 've been talking about ? Possibilities . I mean , I think my mom is still friends with her sorority sisters . Sororities are just a social crutch for people who can 't make their own friends . She said , " No strings attached . " What 's the harm ? The harm is that they get you alone and replace you with Stepford Claire . Well , okay . How about I don 't go alone ? Yeah . No . No . No way . Please . Pretty please . I 'll be your best friend . I 'll throw in a chocolate milk . What would Stepford Gretchen wear to one of these things ? Captain Lubbock ? I 'm Dr. Gibson . Madeline . Where 's Dr. Verheiden ? Retired . You 're new ? I 've been interning with Dr. Verheiden at A.U. for three years , specializing in psychopathy , malignant narcissism disorders ... And how many actual , real-life criminal-psych consults have you done ? Including this one ? So , who is he ? We have no idea . And neither does he . We found him last night covered in dirt , blood . Bullet holes in his jacket . The guy doesn 't know his name , what day it is , nothing . Amnesia can be very complicated . Let me simplify it for you , Madeline . Take out your rubber stamp and mark this guy insane . They don 't give us stamps . I 'm gonna need to talk to him . Hi . My name is Dr. Gibson . I 'm hereto help you . Can you tell me your name ? There 's been a lot of that . Starts and stops ? Mostly stops . What are you thinking ? Could be an aphasia . Could be what ? Any trauma to the head could result in brain damage . He was like this when we found him . Can you tell me what happened to you ? I was in ... I was ... I was in then . In then . In the forest . Lost . And then I was ... Oh , God . Take your time . Walking . And now I 'm here in this room . In this tiny room and ... Captain , can you do me a favor and unlock these cuffs ? No . I don 't make a habit of locking myself in with unrestrained lunatics . Then can you leave me your keys on the way out ? Let 's clean you up , get you some clothes . Maybe something to drink . I 'm gonna help you as best I can . Help you figure out who you are , put the pieces together . I promise . Emma , I wanted to talk to you about yesterday . Are you still seeing things , the colors ? I was thinking more about it . I have another theory . Conversion disorder . They used to call it ... I think this whole filing girl act is finally getting to you . Only the ones who happen to be my daughter . I think this whole focusing on work thing is getting to me . I 've been told by more than one person that I 've closed myself off from human connection . Here , Mom . Mom , careful . It 's hot . It 's hot . So this is me , trying to connect again . Starting with you , my family . The half that bothered to show up , at least . You did call Nathan , right ? Yeah . A couple times , Mom . So I 'm thinking , if ... You didn 't just talk to that aide ? That Elizabeth woman is a phone-message black hole . Can we just focus on me for a second , Mom ? DR. COOLIDGE ; Yes . You hide in here . You 're filing things . It 's the waste of a brilliant mind . Be serious . So I thought being a paramedic , saving the most people possible , that would fill that hole , but I ... Mom ? Yes . Yes . You 're right . Nathan will be fine . Let 's just ... Go on with what you were saying . Start over . I 'm not starting over . I thought you said it was important . I ran into Chief Kaufman . And he said that you could re-start your residency if you want . He always thought you 'd make a wonderful doctor . It 's been six years . It 's time to stop blaming yourself for Christopher 's death . You have to stop grieving and take your life back , Emma . I 'm not grieving . I 'm ... Emma . I gotta go . I gotta get to work . I think I 'll stay for a while . Okay . Maybe Nathan 's just running late . It was good seeing you . Yeah . Hey . Hey . Yes . You work too much . You know that ? Yeah . I do . Bye . And since 1924 , it has been our charge to populate this house ... We 're late . With girls of the utmost quality and integrity . This is , of course , where you all come in . We can 't wait to get to know each and every one of you . Which brings us to my absolute favorite part of rush , G.T.K.P.P.S.D ! Get to know prospective pledges speed dating . Yay ! Okay . So , all the girls on my right , to the chairs on the right . And all the girls on my left , to the left . Should we make a break for it ? No . This is what normal girls do , right ? Really ? Scariest thing that ever happened to me ? Does this count ? My mom raises professional show dogs . Show dog . No boyfriend to speak of . My dad works in paper . Government paper .. I mean , it 's more like a series of ... No boyfriends . Uh ... Hobbies . Um ... You used to be a cheerleader , right ? How did you know ? Gretchen told me . Really ? So you and Gretchen both lived in Texas ? Last round , ladies ! Make it count ! So , Claire , I feel like I know you already . Let me guess . Gretchen . She - : ' s really cool . She 's very ... I don 't know , edgy . Yeah . You okay ? I mean , you almost ... Are you all right ? Hey , wait up a second . Hey . Wait . Wait . Are you okay ? You almost got hit by a bus . I mean , that was ... You almost got hit and ... You 're welcome . Oh ! Come on . Hand me that , will you ? Who is it ? The new family member ? Why are you so interested ? You used my body to find them . I am understandably vested . Is it Petrelli ? Nakamura ? The Strauss woman ? The college co-ed ? Claire Bennet . Is it her ? You don 't know , do you ? I do not . But I felt something . In my bones . In the earth . But the dust hasn 't settled yet . It 's a gamble . Making promises and proclamations to all of us based on a feeling . I understand the risks . But the rewards of growing our family are worth it . We 've got lots of cousins out there . Plenty of candidates . Many seeds planted . But who will break ground first ? I guess we 'll just have to wait and see . Hey , have you seen my white sweater ? It 's frilly and looks kind of exactly like that . Yeah . Can I borrow this ? Uh ... No . Yeah . Go ahead . Are you sure ? ' Cause that " go ahead " sounded a little bit annoyed . And I could just take it off . No , don 't be silly . It looks good on you . Cool . Thanks . So I 'm just going to use the rest room and then we gotta go . Yeah . We 're heading back that way now . Ready ? Um ... Is everything okay ? Yeah . Why don 't you go on without me and I 'll catch up ? No . I can just wait . No , don 't worry about it . I mean , it 's a mixer , right ? I feel like we should be mixing with people we don 't know . I know you already . You know ? Right . Oh . Mix master me . Okay . I 'll see you . It 's amazing . What is this ? Tea . You never had tea before ? I 've never had anything . It all feels so ... It feels so new . Like I 'm feeling everything for the first time . Hot . This ... It 's cold . It 's like I ... I know these things , these words , these feelings , but they 're ... I can 't put them together . They 're not in my head . They are there and then they 're not . They 're gone and it 's ... Scary . It 's very scary . But also somehow beautiful . All of it is overwhelmingly beautiful . Jamais vu . It 's the opposite of déjà vu . It 's quite common in cases of seizures and dissociative amnesia . That 's good news . How is that good news ? I think something traumatic happened to you and you 've blocked it out . It means that the you in you is still in there . Somewhere . I 'd like to try a memory exercise . I want you to close your eyes and tell me the first thing that you see . Um ... Nothing . It 's just black . Just relax , and be yourself . Um ... The ticking . It 's distracting . What do you mean ? That clock . Your watch . They 're off . Somehow different ticks , different timing . One is faster , much faster . This watch has been running fast for years . I keep meaning to fix it but ... What ... You heard that ? Um ... Uh ... So , this ticking thing . It 's good , it 's your subconscious . It 's probably a clue to your past . Lat 's try again . Can I see you in the hall , Doc ? I 'll just be a sec . Okay ? AFIS just kicked back a fingerprint match . We got an ID . Look at what 's happened to me I can 't believe it myself Suddenly I 'm up on top of the world It should 've been somebody else Believe it or not I 'm walking on air I never thought I could feel so free Flying away on a wing and a prayer Who could it be Believe it or not , it 's just me Just like the light of new day It hit me from out of the blue Breakin ' me out of the spell I was in Makin ' all of my wishes come true The colors ? You saw them , too ? You can 't ... You 're deaf . So you read lips . All right . I must have gotten your ability on the street . " Ability " ? This is new to you ? Okay . Um ... There are people like us who have abilities . They can fly . And teleport . And read minds . Sometimes I misunderstand . So can you ... That 's crazy . Is it ? Wow . Pretty amazing , huh ? Why me ? Why now ? That I don 't know . Maybe we can get lunch tomorrow . Figure it out . Get you out of the file room . I 'm fine with the file room . No , I didn 't mean ... It 's fine . Claire . Hey . Hey . I 'm so glad you came back . I was worried you 'd get cold feet . No . My feet are actually very toasty in here . It was nice to meet the girls . Good to expand my social Venn diagram into more circles . Then why stop now , right ? Kara ! Claire Bennet , Kara Hayback . Yeah , I think we met at the G. P.P ... Oh , yeah . Did you know that you 're both ex-cheerleaders ? You , too ? I had spirit , yes , I did . What made you quit ? It sounds stupid , but I kind of hated the cheerleading part of cheerleading . That does not sound stupid at all . I like the bus rides and the bake sales and I rocked a mean poster , but football is kind of ... Pointless and boring . Exactly . Is that why you got out of the business ? No , I just ... Watch out ! Hands on the table . Palms down . Where 's Dr. Gibson ? I sent her home . But ... No , shew . She was here . She 'd said that she came here to ... She was here to tell us who you are . But now we know that , Gabriel . You 're a watchmaker from Queens who murdered your own mother . Did you say " watchmaker " ? I also said " murder . " And " mother . " Now hands on the table . I didn 't do anything wrong . I wouldn 't ... I wouldn 't kill my mother . I would never ... What are you doing ? I 'm gonna use this interrogation room for interrogation again . I 'm gonna get a confession from you about how you killed your mother . No . I didn 't kill anybody . And then they 're gonna throw you down a hole forever . No ! What are you doing ? You said you 'd help me . You promised . You promised . You said you 'd help me . You promised . I didn 't do it . I didn 't say you did . But you were thinking it , weren 't you ? Gretchen , you were the only one there . Why would I do something like that ? Maybe because i was making new friends . Maybe because you want to expose my freakiness to everyone ? Do you actually realize how ridiculous that sounds ? I saw what you 've been looking at on your computer . The stuff about me . What were you doing snooping on my computer ? I wasn 't snooping . A book fell . The computer turned on and I saw it . A book jumped off my shelf and begged you to invade my privacy ? Yes , it did . So I googled you , so what 's the big deal ? I saw the stuff about Annie , too . Can you honestly tell me you had nothing to do with it ? Wow , that stuff that happened to you really messed you up . You 're a crazy kind of paranoid . Paranoid ? No , no , no . Paranoid is ... This is a pattern . The Annie thing . The accident tonight . The computer . The speed dating . I mean , talk about me much ? I get nervous talking about myself . You 're just more interesting . All I wanted was a normal life , and I trusted you . I didn 't kill Annie , and I 'm not stalking you . Okay , maybe I 'm a little bit stalking you , but it 's not what you think . It 's just ... I have a crush . I 'm crushing on you . Say something . Claire Bennet , Gretchen Berg , please accept this bid to join the Psi Alpha Chi sisterhood . It 's getting a little late for Hail Mary passes . Says you . Nothing . Nothing . Hello , Rebecca . I 'm missing bid night , Uncle Samuel . I 'm sure they can carry on without you one night . Hmm . I wanted to check on your work with Claire Bennet . Well , we 're sisters now , so there 's that . You 're doing everything you can to isolate her , push other people away , push her in our direction ? Honestly , I feel like all I do is push . What made you quit ? It sounds stupid , but I kind of hated the cheerleading part of cheerleading . That does not sound stupid at all . I like the bus rides and the bake sales and I rocked a mean poster , but football is kind of ... Pointless and boring . Exactly . Is that why you got out of the business ? No , I just ... Watch out ! Hey , I didn 't see you leave the party . Guess you 're still there . And , you left the windows open . I don 't suppose she 's on her way hereto us now ? No . It isn 't her . Not yet . But I think your dust has finally settled . Get back to campus , Rebecca . Looks like we 're pulling up stakes . I 'm not a killer . Well , you 're a kidnapper and a carjacker . And you beat up an entire city precinct . Somehow . He was going to throw me in a hole . Hurt me ... I ... Nobody believes me , except for you . I don 't even know you , Gabriel . No . No , no . That isn 't my name . I close my eyes , but it doesn 't feel like me . It 's not me . Well , it sounds an awful lot like you . The watchmaker ... Yeah , I know . Your watch . I heard the ticking , but it can 't be . I know I 'm not a killer . You know that . You 're right . What are you doing ? If you 're not a killer , then , by definition , you won 't kill me . Take my car wherever you need to . No . I need you . I need your help . You don 't even know me . I don 't even know myself . Turn yourself in . Let the police figure out what happened to your mother . Let me figure out what happened to you . Okay . Okay . I 'll ... I want to see your hands ! Now ! Do what he says . He 's turning himself in . Put the guns down , please ! Please , put the guns down . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Go . Run ! Run ! So much for human connection . Peter Petrelli ? Hiro ? Hiro ? It 's okay , brother . You 're safe here . Where exactly is here ? Home .

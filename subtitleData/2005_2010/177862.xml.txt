 two brothers were on a fishing trip one of them was taken by a mysterious creature . Now the other one is losing his family . I 'm not sick ! Healthy people do not hallucinate ! My brother is trying to talk to me . I can not live like this . Honey ! And he won 't stop until his questions are answered . I 'm going to talk to the only person I know that saw the same thing I did . It 's out there , isn 't it ? Whatever it is . A government scientist discovered the key to the mysterious creatures . I found it . I know the origin of the species . But powerful forces don 't want the world to know . A biologist tried to save the information . But traded his life for the secrets . He wanted you to have this . Now it 's up to her to unlock the mysteries of the species which she has seen face-to-face . This morning you saw a sea monster ? Yeah . But someone is tracking her . Jessie ! And no one is safe . A young boy found the eggs and secretly raised one on his own . You sure your parents won 't notice ? Go . Nice . He faced a terrible decision . Would he let it kill a man ? Now , Surface continues . Journey-Air three , five , niner , kilo , twenty-thousand feet , heading 227 . Roger , Journey-Air , three five niner kilo , cleared as filed . You 're going down . Today 's the day . I can feel it . Challenge . Major . General . Portland Regional TRACON . Journey-Air three , five , niner , kilo . Getting a little bumpy here . Request descent to 24 thou . Journey-Air , you are cleared at 24,000 . Portland Regional TRACON , you guys reading any storm activity ? Negative , Journey-Air three , five , niner , kilo . We have clear scopes all the way to Maui . Um , Roger , Portland , but we 've got some heavy turbulence up here . Nothing on radar , or satellite . Not a cloud in the sky . Lightning storms . Repeat , lightning storms - Whoa ! Journey-Air , can you verify position ? We 're 200 miles west of - Our starboard engine just went out . Mayday , Portland , Mayday . Passing through 9,000 feet . We 're looking to ditch . Journey-Air , are you stable ? Coming from underneath . All around us now . Rainbows , oh , God , rainbows . Journey-Air , come in . Journey-Air , this is Portland Regional TRACON . Respond . Where 's their signal ? They don 't have one . What do you mean , they don 't have one ? I mean , they have dropped off the scope . They 're gone . He 's dead . They wouldn 't be doing all this if he were dead . Nim , shhh . He 's not moving , man . It 's like Faces of Death . Would you shut up already ? He 's gonna be fine . Did he describe what got him ? Can 't talk , he 's in shock . Is that a bite ? That 's the least of his worries . Guy 's got electrical burns over half his body . From what ? Animal control said he was chasing a crocodile . Yeah , it must 've had a stun gun . Miles , you speak critter . Tell that thing to shut up . Nim , pipe down . Dude , did he see us ? Who cares ? Let 's go . Ooh , hey , give me your cell phone . Why ? 'Cause , how do you think they know where you live ? Probably watching your whole damn neighborhood . Wait-but-Rick - All right , anyone following ? Well , I don 't think so . Well , look ! Come on , now . We need to check . All right , there is a black SUV back there . Okay , that 's it . I ain 't taking ' any chances . Whoa , okay . Let 's just get off this highway . Let 's get off this - Just turn - Turn here . Turn , turn , turn , turn . How many of them were there ? It seemed like just one . But I-maybe they weren 't even following us . Rich , I don 't know . I don 't know . Am I being paranoid ? Uh ... you got people ransacking your house and two people dead , what do you think ? You couldn 't keep a tail on two civilians in a pick-up truck ? Is that what you 're telling me ? No , no , I don 't wanna hear it . That stuff is too valuable . I want it back . Okay , we 're on the main road to the marina . I want you over there now . I 'll have Baker come around the other way . You find them . Stop here . Stop here . I don 't suppose you have a suit back here , do you ? No . All right , we lost ' em . Whoa , hey , what 's going on ? I 'm gonna get us the hell out of here . Huh ? People think that they can come into my life , turn it upside down , into my home where my son sleeps ? What is this stuff ? Is this petroleum-based ? Yeah , it 's for my chainsaw . You mind telling me what 's going on ? That water 's , like , 50 degrees in there , I left my wetsuit at home . Could I borrow these ? Why would you ... go into the water ? Hey , hey ! Wait a minute , where are you going ? What ? I 'm gonna get us a boat . I 'll be back soon . Hold down the fort ! Hold down the fort ? Hold down the fort ? Yeah . My way of the law . I 'll hold it down . That 's how I hold it down . Police guy definitely saw us . You don 't know that . This is reality , man . You just don 't get away . They 're gonna find us . Then fry that guy . The guy fried himself with a cattle prod . You think they care ? He 's an officer . Yeah , he 's a dog catcher . And besides , it 's not like they can try us . We 're under 18 . If they 're in uniform , you 're dead . Doesn 't matter what age . They 'll send you to juvie boot camp , where you work fields 12 hours a day with kids that have killed people . Scout 's honor , dude . My cousin , Tommy , did time in one . So what , like , do you wanna bail ? No ... Just , you know , maybe it 's time for the ol ' white flag . I 'll understand if you want to bail , man . But I 'm not . I can 't . I won 't give up Nim . Can you tell me a little bit about Miles ? Well , he 's thoughtful . Not academically , but he 's very ... intense . When he 's fixated on something . Has he been acting out lately ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but so did I at his age . You never did anything like this . Was officer Furella hurt badly ? He 's in the burn unit out in Capefield Memorial . That 's all I 've heard . And you think Miles did it . I 'm not making any assumptions . Come on , come on , you ... dinosaur . Just give me one . Looking kind of shiny today . Here , you okay ? Here , get up here . You all right ? Yeah . Please . I need a favor . Negative . No more favors for you . Last time you asked a crazy-ass favor . Shut up , Jackson . Shut up , just listen to me . They killed Cirko . Killed ? And his assistant . Listen , they 've got people tearing up my house . Right now they 've got men up and down the bridge blocking it . Slow down . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Listen , I need a safe place to go , okay ? I need somewhere off radar , and you 're really the only person I know who knows about that kind of stuff , okay ? The last time I helped you , I almost died . Jackson , I don 't know what to say to that . I 'm serious . I need your help . You 're lucky I 'm rich and bored . I did a little import / export with my crazy uncle back in the ' 90s - Jackson , not one of your weird rambles right now , please . Wait , no wait , like , think of it like a delivery service , okay ? We didn 't open the packages , we just got ' em there fast . And it was probably a whole lot safer than what you 're getting me into now . Look , Jackson , I really need to know whether you 're , you know , gonna help me out or not . 'Cause I gotta figure something out otherwise . Yeah . Yeah , I am . You wanted way off radar , right ? Yeah . Anything ? No , man . All clear . Okay . As long as we stay focused and don 't spaz , I think everything will be okay . Right . Stay focused . Don 't spaz . Remember the plan . Don 't spaz . Right . If we run , it 's a giveaway . We 're just a couple of kids with a dog carrier . Yeahno problem here , officer . Okay , kids , let 's just take a little breather . Before anybody does anything they 're gonna regret . Nobody 's in any kind of trouble that can 't be fixed . Not yet , but whatever you got there , it 's dangerous . It almost killed a man , you know that ? Miles ? About an hour ago , 911 got a call from a kid about your age . Sounded pretty broken up . Almost in tears practically . That 's what the operator said . But you know what ? That call saved an officer 's life . I think that kid wanted to do the right thing , I think he doesn 't want to see anyone hurt . It 's not a pet you got there , son . Now you and me need to work together . Make sure nothing ba - Go ! Ralph ? Ralph ! Dude , what are we doing ? Boys ! Boys ! We can outrun ' em . It 's locked . Right here . Miles , don 't let that thing go ! Dude ! You guys stop right there . Come on , Nim . Come on . Come here . Come back here ! Come here . Don 't do this Miles , don 't ! Miles ! Hey ! Come here ! Dude , he 's out . Let 's go . Come here ! Miles ! Come back here ! Welcome to the Boneyard . Totally off the grid . We got our own water . Generator , gas supply . Locals think my uncle 's some kind of a pirate . Probably not too far from the truth . How long since you 've been here ? Um , about three years . Well , it 's kind of a pit , bro . But , uh , I like it . You got a nice front yard , that 's for sure . Oh , ho ! A lot of good memories . Hey , D ? What 's that ? What 's this ? Good question . Looks dangerous . Jackson ! Sorry , sorry . Oh , my God . Where do you want me to put it ? Somewhere safe . Okay . Come on , Frankenflower . Hey , Doc ? Where do we start ? Pull up a chair . Well , I 'm here . Are we infested or not ? Cirko 's dead . How ? Car wreck . I had a bureau team work over the accident site . And ? Nothing . Looks like a single car accident . You have a wife ? Widowed , ten years ago . No kids . Pity . Hell of an asset to our investigation . Irreplaceable . Where does that leave his research ? It doesn 't look like he reached any sort of conclusion at all . Certainly nothing we can decipher . What about that South Indian guy ? Singh ? In the car with Cirko . Killed , unfortunately . My assessment of the infestation is that we 've got a lot of localized sightings . A definite ecological concern , sure . But not a threat to security . It worth the funding ? No . What do we do now ? We keep our heads on . I need time to think . I need money . We 're not robbing this place , are we ? No . What are you looking at ? Stay . Don 't ' move . I mean it . Hello ? Savannah . It 's me . Girlfriend . Hi . Wow , are you in trouble . Uh , believe me . I know . All the cops are here . Oh , no . Hello ? Hello ? You 're breaking up . Hello ? Miles ? Yeah , are Mom and Dad freaking out ? No , they 've never been prouder . They say they 've always wanted to have a killer in the family . I didn 't kill anyone . Okay , maim them . Savannah , just lay off . I can 't take this right now . I really can 't . Are you okay ? No . I need a favor . Listening . I have $ 300 hidden in my roller blades . Can you take it to me at the Zenith gas station on Military Cutoff ? I really need it . Well , mom would kill me if I enabled you . Just bring it to me ! Look , Savannah , for once , just act like a sister . I 'm sorry . I can 't do it , Miles . Because even if my car weren 't blocked in by patrol cars , and I could get down the driveway - Give me the phone . Miles ? Where is he ? All right , so , here we go . We got ... journals , sound files , tissue samples , population projections . Holy cow , is that in the thousands ? That 's what happens when you have an invasive species with no predators . What are these ? Those are TIPPs , Trans lonic Pulse Pairs . Ugh , what is that ? You remember , I 'm an insurance salesman , right ? Sorry , they 're like satellite photos of thunderstorms . Mmm-hmm . Why do you think Cirko cared about that ? I , um , don 't know . " Documented Sightings . And Casualties . " That 's my brother . They even got a picture of him . How the hell did they know about this ? Look at that . Four years ? Four years , they knew about this ? And they 've been covering it up ? Now my brother 's a damn casualty file ? How many of these things you say there were ? It 's like we just saw , man . Thousands . More every day . People gotta know . Yeah , but people aren 't gonna acknowledge it unless we have overwhelming proof . We got overwhelming proof . Look at all this stuff . You recorded one . We tagged one . Yeah , and my house got ransacked , and I got framed . Okay , well , look , we 're gonna have to find something that-that just can 't be explained away like that then . All right ? Something we can put on Larry King . Blast into every home in the country . Yeah , but if you want proof , we have to find out where they are . Well , we find out where they are . Fine , here , come on . Here , what 's that ? N.O.S.S.U.R. data . Undersea sound files . That sounds fascinating . Go ahead with it . Come on , you 're the scientist . Hypothesize . So , she gonna hook us up ? Can 't . There are cops at my house . Your parents don 't give you , like , a credit card for emergencies or anything ? No . Do yours ? Would I be asking if they did ? No ATM , no bank accounts , nothing ? Oh , yeah , there is that money my parents set aside for the day I became a fugitive . Okay , so , we can 't afford a bus ticket , 'cause we don 't have any money . And-hey maybe that guy would give us a ride . Negative , had a bad vibe a couple minutes ago . Dammit . It 's Savannah . Hey . Two boys , right ? Around the back of the building . Okay , thanks . We 'll take it from here . Are you sure they came back here ? Yeah , I 'm sure . Two kids and this little dragon thing . Hey , where 's my car ? You gotta shift ! No , clutch first . Why don 't you drive ? I thought your cousin taught you ? It was an automatic ! Okay . Clutch . Shift . Okay , now , let it out . Dude , we 're driving . All right , how we doing ? Get a depth ? Yeah , 4,300 feet . They 're all between 4,000 and 5,000 . Hey , all right ! Now that 's some concrete info , ain 't it ? Yeah , but they 're bottom dwellers . They 're over a mile down there . Oh , hey , let 's get down there . Without a sub ? Yeah , okay . I mean besides , we 're not talking about a single coordinate here . We 're talking about 10,000 square miles of rough ocean . I abandoned my six-year-old son so I can come where ? Here . I don 't even know where we are . And I 'm supposed to pick him up tomorrow . And it 's , like , I 'm in a shack . In the middle of a junkyard . I don 't wanna hear that , all right ? This is my brother on this map , okay ? I know . I left my kids too , all right ? Now , come on , you keep looking . You gotta keep looking , and you 're gonna find something . Rick , I have looked . I 've looked . I have looked there . I 've looked here . I 've looked in the research . And you know what ? Maybe a lot of it would make a lot more sense if I just had an Internet connection , or maybe just a cell phone . Or perhaps just a clean glass of water . All right , just let me show you something , okay ? These holes , you 've seen these holes , right ? Yeah . All right , now these holes , I obsess over these holes . I see ' em in my sleep . I see ' em when I 'm awake . I mean , I see 'em in the shower . All right ? Now , I don 't know what it is , but these mean something . Now you 've been working your whole life for this moment . Right now . You wanna discover ? You wanna show ' em ? Then , show ' em . Do it ! Make history . Dinner . Daughtery . Knife , matches , silverware . Rich ? Yeah , beer . Amen . So even with this whole operation , Cirko never really figured anything out ? Maybe there really wasn 't that much to figure out . He sure seemed convinced . Yes , he did . Scared the crap out of a roomful of senators with that " invasive species " song and dance . Scary idea . Well , Cirko was an academic . Everything was alarming to him . So you 're sure about this then ? Pulling back from DEFCON 1 ? Well , you know best what resources you have , and whether or not this is a military issue . Yeah . But I do not wanna find myself in front of a congressional oversight committee in a couple of months explaining why I ignored a national threat . Yes , sir . I know . What I meant is , so there 's some new species . Isn 't this more the province of fish and game ? God help us . They 'll set a bag limit . Their problem now . Mmm . The situation is manageable . The investigation 's gone . Yes , she 's still unaccounted for , along with a few boxes of research . I will . Give me some time . * * Keep him out of sight , man . We are conspicuous . Come on , Nim . Back inside . Come on . Miles ... Come on ! Whoa , dude , talk to the hand . Did you see what Nim just did ? Could you focus ? What 's your problem ? My problem is Grand Theft Pizza , dude . This is a stolen car . We 're talking juvie boot camp - You can bail at any time , dude . I told you that . That 's not what I mean . He 's not like some pet , Miles . What 's that supposed to mean ? When you think about it , there 's not much choice . I - I 'm not turning him in . I know . You saw those guys . They 'll kill him . He needs to go back to his people , dude . We 're his people . No , we 're not . We snatched him on the water when he was just an egg . But he 's not little anymore . Really not little , an - We can 't give up Nim . We can 't protect him , Miles . What he needs is to go back . To the ocean . Your call dude . What 's it gonna be ? How long you say you 've been coming out here , man ? Did my first salvage dive about a mile up the coast when I was eight . Hmm . It kinda reminds me of the Bayou . Enjoy it while it lasts . Those population projections hold , we won 't wanna be anywhere near the beach a year from now . Who needs a beer ? Me , please . Okay . Thank you . Sure . She 's something , ain 't she ? Yeah . She is . You and her ever ... Oh , no , no , no . I 'm ... yeah . What 's your wife think of you being out here ? Eh , well , she 's not too happy about it , I 'll tell you that . So what about you ? About me what ? You guys ever ... Oh , um ... We had a little thing once . Oh , man . A little thing ? Yeah , right . Well , now I know what 's going on . What ? Well , I know why I 'm out here in East Bumble . And I 'm pretty sure I know why she 's here . And now I know why you 're out here , fella . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Why 's that ? 'Cause you 're chasing another kind of creature . You 're chasing the love creature . Love monster . That 's okay , man . I won 't say anything . Rich ! Jackson ! Ain 't gonna last long with this thing on top . You think he 'll miss us ? Animals don 't miss . All they want is food . Uh , Nim 's not like that . He 's-he 's like having superpowers . You know , like - like you can fly . Or-or having X-ray vision or something . Nothing this cool happens to anyone . No one . And-and now we have to give him back , ' cause I 'm stup - Don 't answer it . It 's my phone , butt wipe . It doesn 't matter . Don 't answer it . Hello ? It 's for you . Yeah . Miles , are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm okay . Where are you ? u ? Miles ? Last time I said where I was , suddenly we were surrounded . We 're just worried . Not about Nim , you 're not . Nobody is . That 's the problem . Miles , don 't do this , please . Why do I always say the wrong thing with you , huh ? Um , they say that you 've stolen a car now . And-and , um - That-that officer that your pet hurt is pressing charges . And , you know , Miles , I just - I just don 't know what to do . I just don 't know what to do . Miles , are you still there ? Miles ? I 'm sorry I 'm such a screw-up , Mom . I really am . I gotta go . Don 't ! Um , don 't hang up . Miles ? Are you tracing this ? I don 't believe it . Dude , that was my phone ! You 're getting me a new phone , dude , seriously . Come on , dude . Get in the car ! That 's it . We got him triangulated . Out on Oleander , headed toward the beach . He sounded so scared . You did the right thing . We 've got to get him home . Let 's go . No , we 'll handle it from here . We 're coming with you . It 's lightning . It 's electricity . They need it to sustain themselves . The Frankenflower ? Yes , the Frankenflower , but also the species itself . Think about it-remember when we tagged one that day ? The boat fritzed out . Exactly . Everything electrical was gone . The same thing happened at Bolinas Bay . Exac-yes ! The entire power grid . Bam ! It was like - It was like the creature zapped it somehow . You know , maybe that 's why Cirko wanted those photos . Those satellite photos . You know , he was tracking them somehow . How ? What , by the thunderstorms ? Well , not-not quite . I think-I think that the creatures are the storms . Okay ? Look . Same coordinates , exactly a year apart . Here . Look , let me show you . Look , same coordinates . Same place every year . Late November . It 's already the 7th . Exactly , which is why we have to get out there soon . No , we gotta do more than that . We gotta get down . Look at this . All right , look at the holes , right ? Right . Look same longitude . Same coordinates , these holes are right underneath these storms . Ha ! We wanna get on Larry King . We wanna blow this thing wide open , we gotta come back with whatever 's down that hole . Why down ? Because . The answer to what happened to my brother , is down that hole . Hey , how ' bout this ? Yeah . Oh , yeah . That 's good . Put it in the keeper pile . You know what I like about you two ? You 're fantastically unrealistic . Allow me to support your delusion . Hey , man , what the hell ? Boiler . Scotch Marina . My uncle salvaged it off an old steamer . I knew it was here somewhere . It looks thick enough . We could extend this opening into a window . Mmm-hmm , you give me a cutting torch , I 'll give you whatever you want . Enthusiasm . That 's good . Just , uh , remind me one last time why we think this is gonna work . In 1930 , William Beebe and Otis Barton locked themselves in a 5,000 pound tank , hooked it up to a winch , and dropped it off the coast of Bermuda . Before that day , the deepest man dive was 500 feet . They live ? Within a month , they were half a mile deeper than any human had ever been before , in what essentially was a hollowed cannonball . Hey , man went to the moon in a tin can , okay ? You 're talking a bucket of bolts and some elbow grease , we can do this . Unfortunate about Cirko . Yes . He was a good man . Best graduate student I ever had . Not surprising he put it together . And Dahl ? And the Pentagon ? I characterized the species as a strictly ecological issue . No threat to security . He , uh , he de-funded us this afternoon . Everything 's being boxed and shipped to deep storage at Mechanicsburg . You said you needed eight months of non-interference . Now you have it . And , uh , what about the missing documents ? And the plant ? I 've got men working on recovery . It 's a matter of time . I know you were fond of Cirko , but it was a necessary step . Cirko had a curious mind . A dangerous mind . I knew him very well , you see . We took a trip once ... to look at a most beautiful orchid ... a long , long time ago . Phil ... anyone in their right minds would 've bailed by now . You sayin ' I 'm crazy ? I 'm saying , you got us this far , I 'll take it from here . No one 's actually seen you in the car yet . I 'll just - I 'll tell them I stole it myself . You 'd take one for the team ? Yeah . For you . Thanks . But I 'm good . Oh , man . Cops ! There it is , Nim . Where we found you . Okay ! Out ! Both of you ! That kid won 't quit . Take him ! Everybody , spread out ! Come on Nim , run . Fast . This way . We 've got him . Leads us to the water . Three-seven in pursuit . Wrightsville Beach . Head south . He 's heading for the breakwater . That 's just up ahead . Hurry . Come on , Nim . Come on . Nim ? Nim ? They 'll never stop , Nim . Never . Go . Go , Nim . Miles ! Miles ! Miles ! Miles ! Let him go . Come back , Miles . Go , Nim . Come on , Miles . Go . Nim . Good-bye Nim .

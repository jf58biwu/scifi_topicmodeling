 Your training will involve everything from flight systems to launch survival . And make no mistake , we are gonna challenge you - physically , emotionally , intellectually . In the end , less than one third of you are gonna make it to the final year . You know him ? Who ? Donner . Cos it sure he looks like he knows you . No , no , he doesn 't . Oh . This will not be a soft day of orientation . Well , he 's smiling at you . Smile back . Jen , I ... Come on , don 't be such a tightass . No ! Excellent . Candidate Barnes has volunteered to be in the first centrifuge group . CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Oh , no . What 's this ? This is the bucket . An award - first one in your class to heave . And everybody 's gonna get one . Or two . Five , you wash out . You wanna meet me in Major Tom 's ? I could give you some tips . You cannot be serious . What ? I 'm being nice . I 'm being serious and I 'm being nice . What 's wrong with being serious and nice ? You have to lighten up , girl . I 'm so light I am floating . He was making a pass at you . He 's not my type . What , the smart , good-looking American hero type ? He left two people on Mars . OK , fine , the tragic American hero . Even better . Ooh , you 're not gay , are you ? No , I am a geologist who wants to travel to another planet without unnecessary complications . Right . Space nut . A what ? ! A Space nut ? Or she 's gay . No , she 's not gay . Is that first-hand knowledge ? I don 't do astronauts , Rollie . You know that . Yeah , well , you might wanna reconsider . What ? My place , now ! Really ? Mm-hm . We 've got six years of screwing to do in one night , and I don 't wanna miss one minute . Oh , that 's ... Agh ! Woman , damn , you bite hard ! Mm-hm . The door will be unlocked . I 'll be in the bedroom . Did she mark you again ? Yeah . Yeah , she did . I think that 's a German thing . Deutschmark . So , my mother 's saying that Mercury 's in retrograde and that we shouldn 't launch at all . Well , listen to your mother on that , definitely . I try not to . It 's hard to stop . Yeah . I always thought , out of the two of us , you 'd be the one flying . So did I. Sorry , it 's ... No offence . No , none taken . Hey , you see any cows on Venus ... You will be the first to know . Zoe ! Picture ! Have a good time . The flight of Antares - six years , seven planets and eight astronauts , a grand tour of the solar system , the most ambitious exploration in the history of mankind . Today is the day ... So why a manned mission ? Why send men , prone to mistakes , when probes and rovers can do the job ? It 's a six-year mission to seven planets . It 's far too complex . Would you call the last manned mission to Mars a success ? Three of us came back . We 'd all say yes . Despite deserting two astronauts on the planet 's surface ? We knew what the risks were ten years ago , and these people know what the risks are now . Do they ? Aside from your mission commander , this is a very green crew . I know where this is going . Let him handle it , Donner . This crew was picked for its skill and compatibility . But clearly not its experience . I 'd say you 're fishing , Trevor . Well , then I 'll be more specific . We in the press were all surprised when Donner and Shaw weren 't selected . Did it surprise you guys ? They 're alternates . But why ? Does it have something to do with what happened on Mars ? The man just said that it didn 't . But that 's not what I heard . You 're hearing what you wanna hear . The truth would be nice . The cockpit recorder conveniently pixilated before launch ? No public record ... It 's pretty simple . We had a storm . We had to launch , so we did . But did you have to launch , or did you and Shaw panic and blow out of there to save your own skin ? It 's a simple ... What 's the matter with you ? Donner ... Donner , get off ! Get off . What kind of a stumped-up cowboy are you ? You jumped British TV on launch day ? He jumped me , Mike . And you jumped back ? ! It 's not your job to handle him , Donner , or to talk about Mars . It 's definitely not your job to question my judgment . Your job is to back up Ajay and make sure that that ship is running properly . Yeah , I know what my job is . Do you ? It 's not gonna be your job for much longer , cos as soon as I can bring someone else up to speed , I 'm having you discharged from the programme . Now get out there and say goodbye to the crew . Your collection 's in the vid bank , all 369 hours of it . Dude ! But you gotta crack the code first . Sadist . Vodka on launch day ? You 're at least at 0.12 . Then ground me , Claire . Why are you letting me go ? Because there 's nothing to drink up there , Evram . I 'm saving your life . Wassenfelder and I thought you rocked . Yeah , well , I guess Goss didn 't . One more reason you got the suit , I got the sweater . Goss knows there 's no way that I can do this without you . You , me , that ship , we 're a three-way , Donner . Team . Yes . " Trio " . " Three-way " s different . We are each essential . OK . You cannot blame yourself for not being chosen for this mission . Clearly , your path is here on Earth . Yeah , OK . OK . Go get ' em . 'I 've always believed that you create your own destiny . 'And through a few bad decisions , I 've certainly made mine . 'But as much as I believe in self-determination , there are those who simply do not . 'It 's that kind of thinking that makes me nervous , 'cos being an astronaut is all about control . ' From the walk to the launch pad to the final touchdown , you don 't want surprises . Ten , nine , eight ... 'It 's not about fate . ' Does anyone know whether Mercury is in retrograde ? 'It 's about planning . ' We have tower separation . And ignition . And lift-off . APPLAUSE First step on Antares' voyage to the planets . In Space , there 's simply no room for error . How many of them do you think would have gone if we 'd told them ? Well , that 's a weak-minded question , Eve . But the answer is all of ' em . Every single one . Thank you . I 'll be able to sleep tonight . Godspeed . Godspeed . T minus 120 to burn . MFB is go . Hydrogen go . Deuterium sequence is holding . Donner , where are you on the thrusters ? I 'm making progress . Do not stop the sequence . Ted , do you copy me ? Continue the sequence . Stabilisers set to 140 . Positioning thrusters are at 7 , 9 and 7 ... Oh , God . She 's out . Ted , I got Zoe out and in the airlock . She 's in Airlock 4 . Do you copy ? How the hell did she get out ? Maddux ? RADIO BREAKS UP Zoe , please don 't . Somebody get down here , stop her . Ted , do you copy ? RADIO BREAKS UP Zoe ! What 's the status ? Off-watch crew 's in their quarters . Z-com 's working on a small let leak . It 's no biggie , Donner . You should go home , get some rest . Yeah . They 're playing that every hour . We 're not getting away from it , are we ? Mars is just gonna haunt us till the day we die . The headline in our obits . You 're a Buddhist , right ? Raised as one . Where do you guys come down on fate ? Fate ? Yeah . Predestination , that the future and what happens is somehow out of your control . I don 't believe that . And neither did Buddha . It 's garbage , right ? Through and through . So , this is night one of day one , and we are still in near-Earth orbit . Um ... they want us to talk about anything , about how we feel . I am so proud to be the engineer on this ship . She is my path , my responsibility , this voyage with her , my karma . I am filled with awe and indescribable joy . I know you guys are monitoring this . I mean , you tell us it 's private , but seriously ? So I 'm gonna pull my pants down and show you crack . Yeah , it feels strange not to be sleeping with Rollie , but it 's better for crew morale , I guess . I mean , we were celibate for three months during crew orientation last year , so we 're OK with it , I guess . Hey , baby . Hi , baby . Turn the camera off ! And , Mother , if I ever let you see this , it was a perfect launch , a flawless docking , and the ship is in incredible shape , so so much for your horoscope . BABY CRIES You 're pregnant ? ! Well , puking in the morning and I 'm puking at night , so ... You 're the biologist . Tell me . And this is a serum sample . I dribbled a little . Sorry . Oh , you 're serious . Y 'know , they used to sell tests in the drugstore . Yeah . Not looking for a history lesson if I go to my gyno . The programme will know . So you 're not a spaceman . I am now ! Who 's the father ? Don 't ask . Won 't tell . You did it without protection ? ! We were drunk . He swore he 'd had a vasectomy . Please don 't make me feel any more stupid . If you 're pregnant , what the hell are you gonna do ? Zoe ? Are you OK ? You were just standing there . Did you just hear something ? Hear something ... ? Like what ? I don 't know . High-pitched . Like crying . Um , no . It 's probably just the rotator arm creaking . Right . I 'm sure that 's what it was . Hola , estudiantes . Bienvenidos Antares . Live from the flight deck of Antares , this is our first broadcast from Space , and I 'm going to give you a little tour . Anybody mind if I change the channel ? At the moment , we 're on the flight deck , which is where we control the ship . Mission commander Rollie Crane and pilot Nadia Schilling are programming the injection burn that will send us on our way to Venus . En esta momento , estamos en la carina del vuelo , donde ... Flight , this is Surgeon . This is Flight . Got a couple of weird EKGs from Rollie and Ajay . They 're similar , so it 's probably a glitch . I 'm gonna have Evram adjust their med patches . Advising . Fido , what 's the max time we have left in orbit ? We need the Venus burn in 30 hours and 16 minutes . It 's a hard window . You seriously didn 't hear anything strange last night ? Strange ? No . ZOE SIGHS Then it was the rotator arm . That 's your story and you stick to it , OK ? Yeah . I don 't know . I haven 't been sleeping very much . Weird dreams . Some things are in zero gravity and some aren 't . Well , our grab suits contain nanofibres that pull us towards the deck electromagnetically . But anything without the technology , like Jen 's tomatoes , will float . Ah . Neat , huh ? Ajay , we need to check your med patch . Is there a problem , Evram ? I think it 's just an adjustment . Sorry , Paula . Gracias . What 's happening to that ? Rollie and Ajay have a glitch in their med patch . Trying to get a cleaner read . It 's not clearing up anything , Ev . Now ? Negative . Could you relay this is a waste of time and I 've got work to do ? Why don 't they try a couple of new ones ? Ev , try a couple of new patches , it might be the contact points . Copy that . Our favourite place , the observation deck , where we look at our amazing universe and watch movies and Youtube from our data bank . Any one of our vista panes become screens . Hah ! This is our physicist , Steven Wassenfelder . It looks like he 's doing something complicated . Can you tell us what you 're doing ? You probably don 't want to know . Come on . Don 't be so condescending . Tell us . Well , actually I 'm trying to crack a 5-12 encryption code ... Ah-ha ! . .to get to the porn that my friend loaded into the bank for me . He always finds the dirtiest stuff . LAUGHTER What 's the delay there ? 30 seconds . You 've got 20 to put a lid on it , and Ted ? Sir ? Let 's give our boy genius a spanking . OK . See that blip here ? Between the S1 wave and the S2 ? It 's a midsystolic ejection murmur . And both of them have it ? That 's impossible . These are the old patches . Let 's see what the new ones say . No , these are the new ones . We 'll have to do a heart scan before I can clear either of them for flight . It 's just not possible for both of them to come down with heart murmurs . It has to be an equipment error . Yes , it has to be . You said that Mercury is a retrograde , so maybe this is a Mercury in retrograde thing . Don 't encourage my mother . In a strange way your mum is kind of right . We 're hopelessly dependent on planet alignment . We 've got 28 hours to leave or we 're screwed and the next launch window isn 't for six years . Then we have to use Rollie and Ajay . Actually , no . I 'm not following . Then you didn 't read the latest flight schedule . A service pod is heading for the Space station tomorrow . Ajay and Rollie 's alternates could possibly be on it . Hello , Ted . Hello , Donner . Don 't you dare go there . Six years alone up here with the old boyfriends . This is calcified plaque , here , here and here . It 's on aortic valves , which is causing stenosis . I don 't know how it got there or why it wasn 't there three days ago , but I 've checked the results five times and it 's real . The odds of this , of two men at the same time ? Off the chart . OK , Claire . Put a med team on it . Check for everything : diet , environment , viruses . Run a detailed analysis of every crew member . We 've gotta find out what 's causing this . I can 't clear these men for Space travel . We got that . You 're excused . Get the pod ready . We want a few minutes . You don 't need more time , Mike . You know damn well what 's causing this and they 're going . This is our mission . I 'm not going to let that thing dictate any more of the crew . Wassenfelder 's bad enough . We don 't have a choice . D 'you think I want to send my husband ? That makes two of us . And Donner for about 100 reasons . Who 's to say this thing isn 't it give them heart murmurs ? There are no guarantees , Mike . None . We 're in uncharted territory here . This seems to be what it wants . Whether you want to face it or not , it has a lot more to say on this mission than we do . Remember last night I asked you about fate ? I told you I don 't believe in fate . I 'm a Buddhist . Yes , I didn 't tell you something . I 'm having a dream about this mission . And ? You and I are both on it . You 're both going to need immediate physicals . You have tonight to get your things in order , then launch in the service pod tomorrow morning . Report to medical now ? Yes , Donner . Leave us . Roger that . This wasn 't supposed to happen . Ted , you have no idea . We need to see the mission commander upstairs . # Stitch # In your knitted brow # And you don 't know how # You 're gonna get it out # Crushed # Under heavy chest # Trying to catch your breath # But it always beats you by a step Your sterilisation . It 's painless . Actually it 's not . I had it done when I got back from Mars . Well , yeah , according to your chart you did . But not according to your scan . When were you going to tell everybody else ? In 43 days ... . .when you get to Venus . I 've always believed that this is my mission , my ship , that I was travelling on a path that Ganesha wanted for me , that this ... out here ... was where my challenges and obstacles lay . I feel so lost now . I cannot understand this . I cannot . Who needs this path more than I ? Pop , I 'm going on a mission . VOICES DRIFT FROM THE TV It 's six years and I don 't know if you 're going to be here when I get back . You had the sweetest slider I ever saw . Fastball , change up . Monster curve . You had all the tools . I wanted something else , Pop . Pour me another before you leave . Maybe I could request a replacement . I could come back on the pod . No , there 's no time for that . Jen , forgive me . I want you to know that I was going to be there with you . Then be there with me . Yes . What ? For everything . Just remember how much I love you . OK ? Show me . Let 's kill the flight deck cameras . Give the mission commander some privacy with his wife . # Running against the wind # Playing the cards you get # Something is bound to give # There 's hope for # The hopeless # There 's hope for # The hopeless # There 's ho-o-o-o-ope # There 's ho-o-o-ope # There 's ho-o-o-ope # There 's ho-o-o-ope . # The way I see it , they 're lucky . You can 't call an ambulance on the surface of Mars . You realise this all points to a common cause ? There 's no way it occurred randomly . It could be viral , environmental , something they were eating ... We were eating . They 're looking into everything . Claire 's going to monitor us all very closely . BABY CRIES Did you hear that ? What ? That . No . No . It 's the , er ... It 's the rotator arm . I 'm going go check on Ajay . Tom , I got the porno up and running , so he can pop his halo off and just enjoy . BABY CRIES Zoe Byers ? I 'm Ajay Sharma . Hi , Ajay . Hi . Er ... It 's a good thing that you won the bucket . I 'm not so sure about that . No , it ... Upchucking is an obstacle that we all must face eventually , and you were fortunate enough to face it first . Is ... I ... Hey , Ajay . Scram . Girl talk . Oh . Er ... OK. Another time , then . Can I get a vodka cran , please ? Somebody 's got a boyfriend . If that 's vodka , drink up . Thank God I 'm not pregnant ! Oh , no , no . You are pregnant . You 're just not gonna have a baby . Well , last time I looked , it was the law . It 's a stupid law . A couple of justices kick and it 'll be reversed . Zoe , you have more than one option here . I don 't know . There were over a thousand qualified applicants for your slot alone . Getting into this programme was winning the lottery . Believe me , I know . I know . OK , so you cannot give it up for a one-night stand . I mean , you just can 't . I know of a guy . He 's a doctor . When you 're ready , just give me the word . I need some air . Zoe , hey . Not now . Dude , you don 't stand a chance . BABY CRIES DOOR SLIDES Ajay ? Mission control , this is Antares . Antares , this is control . Do we have permission to put up the cameras ? You do indeed , mission control , and thank you for your discretion . Yeah , we didn 't want that to end up in Wassenfelder 's vid bank . Listen , we just had the cameras and operation controls for the airlock quarters go offline . We can 't seem to get ' em back up . Yeah , we 're seeing that , too . I 'll get Ajay to have a look at it . I think Ajay 's the problem . I just saw him enter the airlock quarter . I tried to follow , but he locked me out . Flight , I 'm showing an EVA and MMU pack up and running . Damn it , he 's going for a walk . HE MUTTERS How soon till we can override his instructions ? Working on it . Five minutes . If he 's in that suit , we don 't have five minutes . Where the hell is Donner ? On his way in . What 's the time to Venus burn ? Six hours nine minutes . Ajay 's heart rate and BP are spiking . Antares , this is control . Have you made contact ? Negative , control . Rollie 's running through the channels . Looks like his comm 's off . He tested most stable in the programme . Anyone know if Hindus commit suicide ? No . At least , I don 't think they do . Let me talk to him . He 's turned his comm off . Well , that 's not good . He 's moving away from the ship . Don 't do that , Ajay . 'Space travel is a fool 's game . 'Human beings are 60 % water . 'We sleep , eat , defecate , can 't follow directions . 'And we explode like pinatas when exposed to the vacuum of Space . ' What 's he doing ? Putting himself in orbit . Oh , Ajay . Well , wherever he 's going , I hope he makes it . Flight , we have overridden . We now have control of the airlocks . Antares , this is control . Did you copy that ? We have that here . I 'll go out . I can go out and get him . We want to go out and get him . Do you copy ? Yeah . Let her go . Mike , let her go . Negative . I 'll eat the loss of an EVA suit . I can 't afford to lose another crew member . You and Shaw ship out in two hours . Get your ass in gear . That 's it ? That 's what ? You 're just going to let him die ? I got six hours to launch a ten-trillion-dollar machine to Venus . I don 't have time for Ajay and his silly little meltdown , and I sure as hell don 't have time for you . Don 't piss me off , Donner , not now . As soon as I get back , I quit . Arnel , how much time has he got left in that suit ? 8 hours ? Give or take . 'My old man is right about every single item except the initial premise . 'Man belongs in Space , because of exactly what he brings into the void . 'We carry the baggage of our past . 'Our fears , our superstitions . 'Our failings . ' Mercury went direct two hours ago . It 's too late for Ajay . No , it isn 't . 'But we also carry our hopes and our dreams , 'the hard lessons learned from our lives . ' Donner , you dock your craft to the Antares right now . Negative , flight . Unless you can override these controls , I think we are going to take a detour . They 're on 41 . 'Helluva view out there , huh ? ' Ajay : ' Ganesha and I have been enjoying it very much . ' Ganesha ? He is the lord of obstacles . But he is also the lord of new beginnings . All right . You wanna hitch a ride back and start something new ? This is my path , Donner . Right here . All the way to Venus . Correct me if I 'm wrong here , Ajay , but if you stay out here , doesn 't that mean you 've got to start all over in the next lifetime ? Now , I mean , I 'm no expert , but you 're the one who 's always telling me that each of us has lessons to learn and obstacles to overcome . So maybe this is your big one . You know ? Maybe you overcome this , and you take a big step towards nirvana . You don 't understand . Wait , wait , wait a second . You think I don 't understand ? I think I do . My path is here on this ship with these people . Your path 's back on Earth , Ajay . But you know what ? We can 't do it alone . You , me , the ship , we 're a three-way . HE LAUGHS We need each other . 'For all our faults , and whether we are guided by our destiny 'or we guide it ourselves , 'we 're resilient . We can adapt . ' There is something I must do first . Yeah . APPLAUSE We can find redemption in the simplest acts of humanity . I have never heard of a robot or a probe that was able to do that . So if Space travel is a fool 's game , then hey , that 's what I am , so be it . But I have never felt more alive ... or more human . Antares , you are go for Venus in five , four , three , two , one . Ignition . # Ain 't it good to be alive ? # Ain 't it good to be alive ? # To feel the sun strong against your face # It spills over me like the Milky Way # Whoa # Whoa ... #

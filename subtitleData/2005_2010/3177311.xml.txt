 Viewer Discretion is advised . There are those who believe that a child in the womb shares his mother 's dreams . Her love for him . Her hopes for his future . As if told to him in pictures while he sleeps inside her . Is that why he reaches for her in that first moment and cries for her touch ? But what if you 've known since he was inside you what his life held for him ? That he would be hunted ? That his fate was tied to the fate of millions ? That every moment of you life would be spent keeping him alive ? Would he understand why you were so hard ? Why you held on so tight ? Would he still reach for you if they only dream you 've ever shared with him was a nightmare ? Would he know my love runs through him like blood ? John , now . Now ! The cops meet you at the diner ? I don 't know . Maybe . Yes . Definitely . Sarah Conner , john Conner ! Drop what you 're carrying ! Put your hands on your head and kneel on the ground ! Now ! Do me a favor , will ya ? Fix it .

He doesn 't know the giver like i do . You wanna know a secret ? I don 't know . I don 't like secrets . No ? This is a good one . - Really ? - Yeah . All right . John picked it out . Yeah-well , sort of . You know i 'd been looking and looking and i kind of starting freaking myself out with the whole color and cut and clarity ... So you turned the job over to a 15-year-old boy . You think i 'm a jackass , don 't you ? I 'm thinking i love you . Always remember that . Early shift . Better get going . Right . Early shift . Bye . Terminator . The . Sarah . Connor . Chronicles . SO1EO1 sync : ? Mom , how many times have i told you it 's freaky when you do that ? I 'm sorry . What 's going on ? We can 't stay here , john . What ? It 's not safe . Not safe from who ? No one knows us . No one asks questions . It 's been almost two years . School starts in , like , three weeks . We need to go . No , you need to go . You 're scared .

Leveled a four story research lab along with him . But since there 's no lethal injection for the destruction of property , let 's just stick with the murder of one of our county 's brightest computer scientists . And dedicated family man . That 's-it 's just not - why would she do that , huh ? Well , you know , mr . Dixon . It 's the robots . The ones from the future . The ones skynet sent to kill her son . Which makes total sense . Because , in the future , john 's not only her son , but ... Well , what does it say here ? Oh , " the leader of the resistance " fighting artificially intelligent machines determined to annihilate the human race . " did he strike you that way ? Leader of a scrappy band of rebels ?

 In the future , my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet ... A computer system programmed to destroy the world . It has sent machines back through time ... Some to kill him , one to protect him . Today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created , to change our future , to change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Previously on Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles . Cromartie came through . He knows we 're here . It 's just a head . We 're programmed to repair ourselves . And to blend in . He will rebuild and continue his mission to hunt and kill . I know what his mission is . We 've got a problem . Andy goode rebuilt his chess computer . The Turk . Somebody killed him and took the machine . I was paid money for it , $ 20,000 . Who bought the turk ? That 's all I have . These things , all of them , are programmed with specific missions . The one at the safe house was sent there for the resistance fighters . Humans sent back from the future by John . Everything needs to be destroyed . Every last bolt . Even a single , unaccounted for piece could hasten the arrival of judgment day . you Get it done . I swear I need a list of new students inrict who have enrolled since the fall of 2007 . Males , caucasian , ages 15 to 18 . You boys are in here at least twice a month waving your patriot act around . Let me guess - drugs ? Look me in the eye and tell me you 've never smoked a little marijuana . I 've never smoked a little marijuana . Hmm . Okay , let 's see your paperwork . Court order or a signed national security letter . I don 't have my paperwork . Sorry , the district will not release personal information on students without written authorization from the ... .. thank you for your cooperation . All of us wear masks . They can be worn out of love and the desire to remain close to those around us , to spare them from the complicated reality of our frayed psyches . Mom , food 's done . It smells done . We trade honesty for companionship . Mom , come on . It 's gonna get burned . And in the process , never truly know the hearts closest to us . Mr. Sarkissian , I 'm calling again about the computer , the one called " The Turk " Will you please call me back . 818-555-0189 . Mom . The roast should have been removed from the stove 18 minutes 20 seconds ago it 's fine . All right . Not exactly fine . Where 'd you get this ? Her room . Why were you in my room ? You told me you destroyed everything . She lied . The chip contains visual records of the triple-eight - where it 's been , who it 's interacted with . It carries important information . It 's a brain . It 's the only truly irreplaceable part and she kept it . Next she 's gonna tell us that somehow that 's gonna help us find the turk . It won 't help us find the turk . What are you saying ? What I 'm saying is what I have been saying , John . She can 't be trusted . No matter how she acts on the outside , we have no idea what 's going on in ! There . Well , I could say that about you . Who showed you to my safe house ? She did . Who else knew about it ? Nobody . Where are my men ? In the morgue . I didn 't give the triple-eight the safe house location . Prove it . Have you ever hacked one of those ? Have you ever read what 's on it ? No . But you have . So how often do you lie ? When the mission requires it . Do you lie to me ? Sometimes . About important things ? Yes . Important things . All right , bro . This is what I 'm talking about . You can 't get these kind of goods unless you got family in korea . Dual-core processor , brand-new system bus , overclocked memory . They 're using it for the effects in the new dark man series . Wow . What 's the video throughput ? 1 . 4 Terabytes per second . Mas macho , brother . I 'm gonna need two . Cool . Am I making a mistake with this chip thing ? Do I wanna see what 's on it ? Tell me " no . " I 'd rather tell you after . Flick those bastards off the jeep . Look , since you obviously have no clue how to read this garbage , would you mind making a 7-eleven run or something ? Pick up some burritos , chocolate milk . It 'd mean a lot to me . How much power are you giving the chip ? Uh ... We are running at 2 . 5 Volts . My cpu requires a minimum of 6 . 2 And a maximum of 8 . 7 Continuous voltage in order to function properly . Well , that much use would burn out any processor I have ever seen . Access to visual memory will require less power than higher level functions . Higher level functions . Decision making . Strategic mission analysis . We don 't wanna activate those functions . So crank the juice but not too much ? Yes . Crank the juice . Wow . What a mess . How the hell do you keep your brain organized ? Not like yours . No kidding . Vick , god , you poor thing . ? I told you , just take one of my pills . Fine , babe , come back to bed . I can 't sleep with you standing there like a statue . Was that thing ... Married ? The t-triple-eight is an advanced model infiltrator . Yeah , but I don 't think she knows . I mean , is that possible ? She would not be the first human fooled by a machine . I know I have been working a lot . And I know it 's been hard for you hanging around at home since your car accident . I thought we 'd made progress . Just talk to me , sweetie . Don 't keep it inside . Please . Please . At least now we have an address to go to . That chip is really creepy . We 've seen some creepy things . He 's protecting her . Why ? And why like that ? Because they 're twisted . That 's why . I 'll be in the jeep . She didn 't do it . She didn 't give up the safe house . She 's not like that other one . I hope not . Have fun at school . It 's pizza day . I read the newsletter . Isn 't pizza day tomorrow ? Yeah / she hasn 't been here for a while . I wonder what she thinks happened to her husband . Are you kidding ? She 's dead . We don 't know that . He wasn 't holding her captive . He wasn 't intimidating her . They lived here together . You think you 'd know ? I know I 'd know . Computer 's gone . Triple-eight probably jumped it to cover his tracks . " Barbara chamberlain , city manager , los angeles . " City manager , that 's infrastructure . No wonder skynet 's interested . You think this woman has anything to do with the turk ? Well , I think if skynet 's interested , we 're interested . Do you not wanna work on this ? Because I do . I want us to be happy . I 've made a decision - we 're gonna figure out what we want . Together . I 'm quitting my job . I 'm - I 'm coming home . That 's not a good idea , babe . See it ? I got it crowd surfing during bjork 's secret show at the echo last october . Man , it was the best five seconds of my life , I swear to god . But I got dropped on a chair . I consider it my first tattoo . That 's tight . Hey , Sherry . Uh , I was thinking maybe we could use study hall to get ready for the chem test tomorrow . Yeah . Sure . That 'd be great . So I hear we used to be midwest neighbors . What ? You know , I 'm from lawrence in kansas . And I overheard you were from wichita . So we 're practically cousins geographically - who told you I was from wichita ? I don 't remember . I 'm not . Whoever said it heard wrong . Okay . See you in study hall ? Yeah . Great . Way to go , ! Johnson . I need to speak to eric carlson . He in some sort of trouble ? No , no trouble . Where is he ? He just got outta gym class . Give him five to finish showering . Eric carlson ? Hey ! Eric carlson ? What seems to be the problem , sir ? Hey ! Are you for real , buddy ? You think I can 't get you fired for that little peep show ? Coach ! I just finished going through the first set of files you grabbed . Only understood a third of what I read . You 've been doing that for 20 minutes now . With my toothbrush . I got you your own . And now it 's mine . Mom . So I figured out that they don 't store memories the way we do . They store them by categories . Like , mission or location or whatever . How did you figure that out ? Remember those weird robot symbols ? I still don 't know how to read them . But the exact same one kept popping up every time a clip of barbara was playing . You should look at this . Stop . Please . He gained her trust . Made her think he was human . Then killed her . That 's what they do . John , get the flashlights . We 're gonna find her . Finding barbara 's body should not be a mission priority . You 're right . But we 're gonna do it anyway . We 're here . You see anything ? No . I don 't understand your need to find her . She 's dead . That 's because you don 't value human life . But she 's not life . She 's just a body . Bones and meat . Was that bad to say ? So do we do this a lot in the future , sneak around in the dark ? We do this a lot . I was kinda hoping we wouldn 't find her . That 's not barbara . Who the hell 's jessica peck ? A threat to skynet . Well , how did she get in there to meet with the city council without us knowing ? I can 't be everywhere . I can 't . I 'm working from home because I just have some family stuff I need to deal with . I have to go . Jessica peck 's trying to shut down my program again . Jessica peck was a lobbyist being paid to oppose artie . Who 's artie ? Automated real time traffic information exchange . It was one of barbara chamberlain 's pet projects . I think it 's one of skynet 's pet projects . So this is about traffic lights ? Exactly . It 's a fiber optic network linking every street intersection to a data center in city hall . Camera 's , microphones , sensors . Right now it 's only a pilot program , but it could grow statewide . Traffic . It 's not about traffic . It 's about information . Eyes and ears everywhere . A system that can watch you , track you everywhere you go . If the turk is destined to become skynet 's brain , this software could be it 's nervous system . Like a body waiting for it 's head . And we don 't have either one . Well , I guess when they say , " you can 't fight city hall " they really mean it . Yeah , well , whoever said that doesn 't have as much plastique as we do . We can 't blow up city hall . It 's really not that hard . If we destroy the program , they 'll just rebuild it . But if we plant a virus and crash it , maybe they 'll think it 's a bust . It 's already a controversial program . Can you make the virus ? Sure , but city hall 's computers aren 't accessible from the outside . Just make me the virus . I 'll get it inside . Getting through security won 't be easy . Once we 're inside , there 'll be more guards , cameras . What can I get for you ? Just an iced tea , thanks . Uh , a beer . ? Thank you . I used to be her . Huh ? The waitress . I used to work in a diner . I can 't see that at all . I had this regular , tracy . She had two beautiful kids . She left her husband , moved her kids to L. A. To get ' em into show business . I 'd bring her eggs every day . And I 'd hear what she said to them . That they had bad skin or crooked teeth . One lie after another . I swear sometimes I understand why they drop bombs on us . Don 't worry about it . We 're not going in the front door . These buildings are all connected by a series of underground tunnels that were built during the cold war . I did a project on ' em in the ninth grade . My last year at school . And how do you know they 're still functional ? I lived there , kyle and I. After they dropped the bombs on us . Cameron . Cameron baum . Yes . Uh , happy pizza day . Thank you . I had two slices . Do I look fat ? Um , still good . So I had a little issue last week with a banned substance in the student parking lot . And now , as a condition of my rehabilitation , I hand these out to people . There 's a cop in the principal 's office . He wants to talk to your brother . Uh ... Is he hiding ? Does he have stuff in his locker ? Wait , he 's not a narc is he ? I 'll make sure John gets this . I need you . You wanted to see me ? John baum ? Yes , sir . Thank you for your time . Cameron . What are you doing ? Never mind . Okay . I have no clue what happened to you in kansas . But your sister 's a genius , and I have got nerves of steel . Huh ? We got that cop off your back , and I have never felt mose alive . What cop ? Oh ... I don 't think I can do it . I can 't finish . But you 've almost completed it . But if I do , I just - I feel like it 's become a monster , you know ? It 's become a horrible thing between us . And ever since I started working on it , you 've been so - I don 't mean to blame you . Finish it . Finish it . You scared the hell outta me . How long you been sitting there ? A little while . That was effective . What he did , when he touched her lips . Effective ? I could see that she liked that . What are you doing ? No . When you say things like that , what are you doing ? Just making conversation . Since when do you just make conversation ? I don 't know . I just seems like something I should do . And was having morris impersonate me with that cop also something you thought you should do , no matter what happened to him ? Yes . But it wasn 't a cop . It was cromartie . What ? W - what ? He 's going school to school looking for you . Trying to match your face . He 's moved on though . He won 't go back there . I wouldn 't . The only way that I 'm reassured by that is if I remember that in the core of your chip you 're just like him . Oh , god . She 'll move us so fast . You cannot tell her , okay ? Promise me . Hey . Do I smell nail polish ? What are you guys talking about ? Just making conversation . Sayles was always , uh - I loved him , but he was an idiot sometimes . He was careless . You were following barbara chamberlain . I wasn 't . I didn 't know he was . There were a lot of leads , you know . We spent a lot of time on our own . I didn 't know . Mom , what are you doing ? Mom . Mom , talk to me . What are you doing ? Barbara 's name is in here somewhere . On some list in some file . She 's buried in here . Why do we always find out about these people when it 's too late , when they 're dead ? Do all these people have to die so that we can win ? Is that it ? Who else are you talking about ? Are you talking about andy goode ? Is the virus ready ? City hall 's closed . I leave in half an hour . I didn 't know sayles was tracking her . You gotta believe me . I don 't have to believe anything . In fact , I don 't . Are you sure you know where you 're going ? Well , I should . This is where I lost kyle to the machines when we were kids . We need to keep moving this way . There 's an elevator shaft . There shouldn 't be a wall here . In the future , there 's no wall here . Meaning ? Meaning we need to blow it up . That 's gonna draw attention . We 're on a fault line . They 'll think it was a tremor . Data center 's on b-4 . All right , let 's go . It 's working . What 's going on ? Are we good ? Something 's wrong . The system 's blocking the virus . We can still blow the place . Hold it . Get them past here . Freeze ! Down on the ground now . Reese . Let 's go . What 's the matter ? I get in , I get to a certain point , and it kicks me out . It 's like a part of Vick 's memory just turns off . I 've even cranked up the juice . Oh . And there goes the power supply . That 's weird . My phone is dialing for an internet connection . What the hell ? Vick 's reactivating . He 's trying to get online ? Did it happen ? Did he get out ? Did he call someone or something ? No . We should be very careful with Vick 's chip . Yeah , that 's the understatement of the century . Well , how did it go ? It didn 't work . We should just blow it . We can 't go back there . What are you gonna do , take an axe to every traffic light in town ? No . We only need to take down one . Two centimeters left . One centimeter down . Cut a semicircle with a diameter of 12 centimeters . Is it okay if I 'm off by a little bit ? Yes . Cut a bigger circle to compensate . How exactly is this gonna work ? Her neural network is the most sophisticated learning computer on earth . If we can get her chip into the a . R. T. I. E. System , it can take over the whole thing . Just like Vick did with my laptop . She can kill it . You can get in through a traffic light ? Yes . Are you sure ? No . Are you sure ? No . Start the incision . Push harder , down to my endoskeleton . Sarah . Once she 's in the city 's mainframe , what 's to say she 'll come back out ? You know , maybe - maybe it 's not the turk that created skynet . Maybe it 's her . Maybe this was her plan all along . She 's a machine . She doesn 't have a soul and she never will . You don 't have to trust her . You can trust me . Good . Set the pliers over the shielded tab on the end of the chip . A half turn counterclockwise and pull it out . It 's okay , John . It 's not the first time we 've done this . I have to get this into the cpu interface . I 'll take him to the traffic light . Okay , she 's in . How long ? 15 Seconds . 20 . For what it 's worth , I believe you . I don 't think you knew your guy was watching barbara . Thanks . Okay , it 's done . Hey , hey , what are you doing ? Derek , don 't . I want you to hear this in no uncertain terms . Someday one of these things is gonna kill you . It 's not gonna be this one . What was it like ? What 'd you see in there ? I saw everything . Sarkissian returned my call . He 'll meet about selling the turk . He 's still got it ? When 's the meeting ? Tomorrow morning . Meaning this news could have waited ? You killed andy goode . There was no one there to protect him . And you killed him . You lie to me again , I 'll kill you . So much danger in this world is hidden behind masks . We tell our children stories of good and evil , while knowing it 's not that simple . Do you realize that in 36 hours we 'll be waking up in tahiti ? I can 't believe you bought us tickets . True evil doesn 't give us time to fight , or to be afraid . We keep our heads down , never bothering to look behind the masks . And in doing so , we resign ourselves to terrible fates we can never see coming .

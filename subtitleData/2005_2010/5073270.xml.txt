 BORDEN : Are you watching closely ? CUTTER : Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts . The first part is called the Pledge The magician shows you something ordinary ... or a man . He shows you this object perhaps he asks you to inspect it ... real . normal . it probably isn 't . you fool . The second act is called the Turn The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary . but you won 't find it ... you 're not really looking . You don 't really wanna know . You want to be fooled . But you wouldn 't clap yet because making something disappear isn 't enough . You have to bring it back . That 's why every magic trick has a third act . The hardest part . The part we call the Prestige . PROSECUTOR : The Prestige . And did Robert Angier ... your employer get to that final part of his trick that night ? sir . Something went wrong . - What went wrong ? I saw someone making their way below stage . I followed him . watching Mr. Angier drown . Mr. Cutter ? I 'm an ingénieur . I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them . Mr. Cutter ... was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr. Angier 's illusion ? no . It was- - The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken off-stage . Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the interval . How large was this tank ? about 4 or 500 gallons . How do you think Mr. Borden was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing ? He 's a magician . Ask him . DEFENDER : I ask again that this man explain ... ... the mechanics of Mr. Angier 's illusion . The Real Transported Man is one of the most sought-after illusions in this business . I have the right to sell it on . then the trick is worthless . How can we know that the tank wasn 't some part of the trick that went wrong ? I see your predicament but Alfred Borden 's life hangs in the balance . If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private I might be able to judge their relevance to the case . Might this be an acceptable compromise ? GUARD : I 'm gonna have to ask you to turn out your pockets . sir . The warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air . He 's convinced he 'll try and escape . I told him the only way that Borden 's gonna disappear is if I leave him out there with the other inmates . Check the locks . Twice . My name is Owens . I 'm a solicitor . accomplished amateur magician and historian- - BORDEN : How much ? - Lord Caldlow is interested- - - How much for my tricks ? Five thousand pounds . my ingénieur . Money 's for him . I did . He offered to sell me your tricks . All except the most valuable one : The Transported Man . I wouldn 't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick . Even for your daughter ? If the newspapers are right and you are for the drop ... - ... your daughter will need looking after . - Fallon will take care of her . Bernard Fallon ? A man with a past almost as obscure as your own . Courts motioned that the girl be removed from his care . the girl will be an orphan . I know you 're no stranger to the workhouse . It 's better than here ? I 'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity . And I 'm offering your daughter a future . she will want for nothing . Ever . think it over . And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this as a show of good faith . He said it might be of interest . This is Robert Angier 's diary . Including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick . - He never learned my trick . - Really ? he mounted a version of The Transported Man that the papers said was better even than your original . you go dig him up and ask him yourself . Mr. Borden . Consider your daughter . ANGIER : A cipher . An enigma . A search . A search for answers . Even if Colorado is the end of my journey ... it 'll take much longer to unravel the rest of Borden 's secrets . the cipher in his notebook is unlocked by a single word ... but it will still take months to translate his writing and to know his mind . my passion is equal to the task . MAN : Mr. Angier ? Welcome to Colorado Springs . sir . quite a reception . Mr. Angier . Your telegram didn 't indicate how long you 'll be staying with us . For as long as it takes . I 'll need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain . for scientific experimentation . I know . That 's why I 'm here . whoa . sir . Ah ! ALLEY : I 'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can 't read my sign . Not the welcome I was expecting . I know you . You 're the Great Danton . I saw your show in London seven times . You guessed every object the audience had in their pockets . I 'm Alley . Sorry about the fence . People interfere with our work . - I 've come to see Tesla . - Why ? He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago . I 'm afraid . I brought a lot of money . Mr. Angier . I simply can 't help you . I 'll be staying at the hotel . Indefinitely . what am I holding ? ANGIER : Your watch . 1897 describes a show at the Orpheum Theater . That was just days after he first met me . BORDEN : We were two young men at the start of a great career . Two young men devoted to an illusion . Two young men who never intended to hurt anyone . MILTON : Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman ? MILTON : If you would tie her wrists . Bind her feet around the ankle . Are either of you two gentlemen sailors ? - No . - No . MILTON : I 'm sure you can both tie a strong knot . he 's boring . whatever that means and now he 's scared . He won 't take any risks at all . he 's squandering the goodwill of the audience ... second-rate tricks . - They 're old favorites . Favorites ? Give me something fresh . He won 't even try a bullet catch . A bullet catch is suicide . All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer to put a button in the barrel . - Fine . Use a plant . ANGIER : You can 't for every trick . - There 'd be no seats left for the punters . - No bullet catch . But the point is that a real magician tries to invent something new that other magicians are gonna scratch their heads over . And then you sell it to him for a small fortune . - All right . - Yeah . I suppose you have such a trick . I do . - Would you care to sell it to me ? No . No one else could do my trick . right ? - Wrong . If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece it might be only he 's prepared to do it . but Borden is right . He won 't get his hands dirty . go to the Tenley . and he really has what it takes . - Chung Ling Soo . - Pricey . I can 't afford that . I know the bloke on the door . You two go and see that show and whichever one of you can tell me how he does the goldfish-bowl trick gets a prize . BORDEN : All right . - Which is ? - Ten minutes on-stage with my old friend Mr. Ackerman . - Really ? - Who 's Ackerman ? The top theatrical agent in London . I saw you drop the knot again . do you ? she 'll break a leg . the Langford double will hold tighter . The Langford double isn 't a wet knot . It 's too dangerous . she won 't slip it . - I can slip a Langford underwater . - She can slip it . We 'll practice . he said no . do you ? no more mistakes . do you ? You wanna take over ? - Just leave it . - I didn 't think so . where 's he from ? - Where are you from ? - He shifts props for Virgil at the hall . - Don 't you worry he 'll steal your tricks ? - He doesn 't deal in methods . - How do you know ? Because I hired him to find out how Virgil does the orange trick . I don 't trust him . - He 's a natural magician . Of course you can 't trust him . I think he 's all right . - You think everyone 's all right . - Even you . Watch your sightliness . If I can see you kissing your wife 's leg every night so can the blokes at the ends of row three and four . it is . - Look at the man . - This is the trick . This is a performance right here . This is why no one can detect his method . Total devotion to his art . you know ? you know . All right . ANGIER : I can barely lift this thing and it 's not even filled with water . Or fish . Look . I don 't know . Hang on a second . He must be strong as an ox . He 's been pretending to be a cripple for years . Any time he 's in public . Any time he goes out . It 's unthinkable . but I couldn 't fathom it . Living my whole life pretending to be someone else . - You 're pretending to be someone else . - I don 't think changing a name compares . Not just your name . Who you are and where you 're from . I promised my family I wouldn 't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors . I thought of a name for you . The Great Danton . Do you like it ? - But it 's sophisticated . - It 's French . ANGIER : Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic . But what does he know of self-sacrifice ? You bloody fool . - He killed it . - What ? What 's wrong ? - He killed it . - I 'm sure he didn 't . now he 'll bring it back . he killed it . No . Look . See ? He 's all right . He 's fine . - Look at him . - But where 's his brother ? your son . he 's my nephew . Oh . You 're the lucky one today . Are you watching closely ? Look closer . Never show anyone . but as soon as you give it up you 'll be nothing to them . You understand ? Nothing . The secret impresses no one . The trick you use it for is everything . Mr. Borden . - You 're welcome . - Alfred . It 's Alfred . - Alfred . So I could use a cup of tea . I 'd scandalize the landlord . I think not . You think that 's- - ? Is that enough to keep me out ? I think so . So I 'll see you again ? BORDEN : Milk and sugar ? JUDGE : What 's in there ? CUTTER : Angier 's machine . Mr. Cutter ? sir . This wasn 't built by a magician . This was built by a wizard . A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do . what happens with these things after the trial ? They 've been sold to a Lord Caldlow . apparently very interested in the case . don 't let him take this . - Why ever not ? - It 's too dangerous . I 'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it 's got a simple and disappointing trick . sir it has no trick . It 's real . JUDGE : This is the tank Angier drowned in ? CUTTER : Yes . This is the place where the performer 's hand reaches through to the trick padlock . A standard magical apparatus for escapes . with one important difference : This isn 't a trick lock . It 's been switched for a real one . What a way to kill someone . Your Honor . Showmen . Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths ... to shock . Even without an audience ? There was an audience . this water tank was of particular significance to these two men . Particularly awful significance . MILTON : Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman ? If you would tie her wrists . Bind her feet around the ankle . Are either of you two gentlemen sailors ? No . I 'm sure you can both tie a strong knot . Robert ! No ! No ! No ! Julia . Julia . Julia ! Julia ! CUTTER : I knew an old sailor once . tangled in the sails . but it took him five minutes to cough . He said it was like going home . Borden ? Angier . Which knot did you tie ? I keep asking myself that . - And ? - And ... I just don 't know . You don 't know ? I 'm sorry . You don 't know ? You don 't know ? SARAH : Alfred ? Good news . We got our first booking today . - I don 't think we 've had the pleasure . - Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur . and don 't ask . is Mr. Fallon . - So- - - We can 't afford to pay him . Money will come when we get the audience . it 's barely enough for us . Don 't worry about it . I 'll share half my food with him or something . You 're already going to be doing that with someone else . - No . You 're- - ? - Having a baby . my God . We should have told Fallon . That is great . We 're having a baby . come here . what 's this ? this is just the trick to wake Ackerman up at the end of my act . Is it the masterpiece ? The great trick ? no . The world is not ready for that one yet . spectacular bullet catch . I promise . Look . - Shoot me . - Shoot you ? shoot me . I can 't . not there . Shoot me here . Don 't- - - How 's that ? - That 's very good . I can 't do that . then you can 't do it . Alfred- - - I can 't do it ? but I can 't raise a child on my own . - You don 't tell anybody that I told you . - Okay . Gunpowder wadding and a bullet . A ramrod . Hold out your hand . The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired . it 's actually very obvious . you still get- - people still get killed doing that . you know . Somebody could get a smart-ass . He can put a penny or a button ... somebody could put a bullet there . Don 't worry . Don 't worry because I 'm not gonna let anything happen . Everything 's gonna be all right because I love you very much . - Say it again . - I love you . - Not today . - What ? and today you don 't mean it . Maybe today you 're more in love with magic than me . I like being able to tell the difference . It makes the days it is true mean something . All right . ladies and gentlemen . If there are any ladies or gentlemen here . - Solid metal . MAN 1 : Seen that already . WOMAN 1 : Leave it out ! MAN 2 : Come on . mate . - Who threw that ? - I did ! MAN 2 : Get out your gun . You 're gonna need it . MAN 2 : Get a gun . is it ? So who wants to volunteer ? MAN 3 : Me ! Me ! MAN 4 : Me . cowboy . sir ? Yes . Borden ? Borden ? I don 't know . Ah ! and I told him the truth . That I have fought with myself over that night . One half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double . I can never know for sure . How can he not know ? ANGIER : How can he not know ? He must know what he did . He must . that bloody hurts . SARAH : I don 't understand how it can be bleeding again . It 's as bad as the day it happened . - We have to get a doctor back . - We can 't afford the bloody doctor back . - You 've woken her . - Great . I 'm sorry . I need this to heal so I can go back to work . face things . What tricks can you perform with this kind of injury ? I can do card pulls . I can do some prop tricks . I can still do that . And I can do the trick that I 've been telling you about . The one that they 're gonna remember me for . Come on . Never thought I 'd find an answer at the bottom of a glass . Hasn 't stopped you looking . Heard about a booking . up-and-coming magician . - Who ? - You . You got me a booking ? Why ? I wanna keep on working . And who 's gonna hire the ingénieur that killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum ? Someone who knows it wasn 't your fault . Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots . I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river . that one . We 'll have to whitewash the windows ... but it will do . - We should see about an assistant . - I 've made some arrangements . Have you settled on a name ? I have . The Great Danton . isn 't it ? it 's sophisticated . ANGIER : The birdcage can 't be our climax . Everybody knows it . they don 't . - I don 't wanna kill doves . not a wizard . You gotta get your hands dirty if you 're gonna achieve the impossible . Miss Wenscombe . No point in you meeting Mr. Angier if you don 't fit . On the right . What 's so hard about this ? Nothing . But you 're going down here . CUTTER : Hold it . Hold it there . This has gotta go around there . sure . - All right ? - Yeah . take that one there . - Yep . Okay . - Pin this under . - And this ties up here ? - That ties at the front . - That 's good . CUTTER : Breathe as little as possible . you see ? That 'll go . That 'll flatten . - I see . Yeah . - Okay . but she knows how to present herself . A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection . Thank you . for my final trick I will require the assistance of two volunteers . if you would oblige me ? CUTTER : Yeah . Okay . Bring your hand around . yeah . There . I put it around its foot . ain 't he ? - You get a volunteer to put a hand there . - Yeah . CUTTER : And another one there . please . Olivia . You best not be intending ... Mr. Angier . - Of course not . You ready ? All right . One ... Two ... - Three . - Three . Go . Cutter . Very nice . And the best part is ... I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty . Someday perhaps you will . I just had to know that you can . Mr. Merrit . I haven 't had the chance to compliment your beautiful theater . it 'll be a lot more beautiful when it 's full . you all say that . somebody else 's will . Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape ? Mr. Merrit . likely to see one too . What would that do for your business ? Mr. Merrit . Thank you . Sir ? In the third row there . Please stand up and show us your handkerchief . This isn 't mine . Perhaps you 'd be so good as to return it to the lady in the aisle . I believe she has yours . Thank you . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm making so many mistakes . I 'm so nervous . The audience doesn 't seem to be responding . but not this next one . Put a cloth over . - Fingers crossed . - I 'll have the champagne ready . - You 've seen this one before ? MAN 1 : We 've seen them all . shall I ? please . A lady and a gentleman to hold this cage with me . I 'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or any other audience anywhere in the world . if you 'll place one hand on the back of the cage one hand on the front . one hand on the top . Ah ! - Should have spotted him . - You had a lot of plates going . - Don 't suppose they 'll let us do it again . - No . ANGIER : What 's the climax of our show ? - Show ? You don 't have a show . We have a week 's engagement . not butcher birds and break my customers ' fingers . Clear out . Anything here in the morning gets burned . John . I 've hired a comedian . You know I hate comedians . there 's plenty of good theaters . change the name of the act- - The name stays . then . I have a couple of methods to try out . And then we need a new angle on the presentation . and if you need some inspiration there 's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week . you know ? That sort of thing captures a public 's imagination . Mind if I join you ? Tesla sends me down here during the storms . Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink . Two of them . I miss New York though . - So why are you here ? - The lightning lives here . And not much else . Our work is secret . Is that a cipher ? It 's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary . but time-consuming to translate even when you have the five-letter keyword . Which is ? We magicians have a circle of trust . You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole ? Maybe I bought it . And you 're hoping to find a great secret in there . I 've already found it . That 's why I 'm here . Tesla built one for another magician . - Why would you want the same thing ? - Call it a professional rivalry . Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people . But he would never talk about it . I understand discretion . I just want the machine . Finish your drink . I wanna show you something . I think you 'll have a special appreciation for our work . - I thought it was a secret . - You 're a magician . Who 's gonna believe you ? Not long now . Our equipment requires a great deal of current . Tesla electrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need to . We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep . Mr. Tesla doesn 't wanna scare anyone . Where are the wires ? Exactly . - Where 's the generator ? - You saw it last week . - That must be 10 miles from here . - Fifteen . And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed . Mr. Angier . ANGIER : Magic . Real magic . MAN : Now appearing only here at London 's Royal Albert Hall . One of the miracles of our age . A technological marvel . You 've never seen anything like it in your lives . Your eyes will not believe what they 're witnessing . ladies and gentlemen . clean power . Would you like to know the future ? The man speaking now is going to change the world . no waiting . I 'm sorry but objections have been raised ... - ... concerning the safety ... - Does that look safe to you ? Part of Thomas Edison 's smear campaign against Mr. Tesla 's superior alternating current . please . We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider ... ALLEY : Which he will not . - ... his presentation . But I 've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions . Clear the hall ! This thing is gonna blow ! please ! Where 's the switch ? This is all perfectly safe . BORDEN : Hey . you . Jess . Have you had a nice day with Mummy ? I love you . - See ? Today it 's true . - Yeah . Hello . ANGIER : I saw happiness . Happiness that should have been mine . But I was wrong . His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied . The family life that he craves one minute ... demanding freedom . His mind ... His mind is a divided one . His soul is restless . His wife and child tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature . What do you think ? What do you think you 'll call her ? I don 't know . what 's hers ? Maybe Sarah . That 's a lovely name . That 's a lovely name . You talk about what you wanna do for the rest of the day . All right ? Go on . You talk with her . They 're taking her away ? To the workhouse ? you keep talking . take it . It 's for the best . Let me see . I 'm gonna learn all the Professor 's secrets . Only if I teach you how to read . right ? have they ? Professor ? maybe I 'm just biding my time . ask : Are you watching closely ? Maybe a magic word or two . And then I 'll be gone . eh ? Magic . get back here ! Thank you . Shut up ! Get him down ! Thank you . Who 's got a bloody key ? 1899 . finally a breakthrough . Tesla 's agreed to see me . It 's perfectly safe . So this is the Great Danton . Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions . Hold out other hand . What 's conducting the electricity ? are quite capable of conducting ... producing energy . Mr. Angier ? I need something impossible . " Man 's reach exceeds his grasp " ? It 's a lie . Man 's grasp exceeds his nerve . Society only tolerates one change at a time . The first time I tried to change the world I was hailed as a visionary . I was asked politely to retire . enjoying my retirement . Mr. Angier . What you want is simply expensive . If I were to build for you this machine you would be presenting it merely as illusion ? if people actually believed the things I did on-stage ... think of sawing a woman in half . have you considered the cost of such a machine ? Price is not an object . but have you considered the cost ? I 'm not sure I follow . Go home . Forget this thing . I can recognize an obsession . No good will come of it . Hasn 't good come of your obsessions ? At first . But I have followed them too long . they will choose to destroy me . then you know you won 't change my mind . So be it . Will you build it ' ? Mr. Angier . I hope you enjoy the mountain air . This will take some time . I thought you 'd gone . I don 't really have anywhere to go . You 've been sleeping here ? Cutter said it 'd be all right till we get another booking . What are you doing ? Research . to see what illusions- - aren 't you ? Cutter 's hoping you 'll let things lie . He says if Borden thinks things are even between you two- - Even ? My wife for a couple of his fingers ? right ? And he 's performing again . as if nothing had happened . all right ? - I 'm alone and no theater will touch me . - Us . You 're going to need a better disguise . Need a volunteer . OLIVIA : What happened ? Did you hurt him ? Robert ? sir . yes ? Thank you . no . Not normal . Not a normal rubber ball . It 's magic . He had a new trick . OLIVIA : Was it good ? It was the greatest magic trick I 've ever seen . ANGIER : Did they applaud when you saw it ? it was too simple . - The audience hardly had time to see it . - He 's a dreadful magician . he 's a wonderful magician . He 's a dreadful showman . how to sell- - - How does he do it ? - Uses a double . it 's too simple . This is a complex illusion . You only say that because you don 't know the method . It 's a double at the end . It 's the only way . I 've seen him perform the trick three times now . it 's not . The same man comes out of that second cabinet . It 's the same man . He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers but if you look closely you can tell . but I do . we can use it as a climax to the show . Yes . I 'm gonna steal his trick . - Find someone who looks like you . - He doesn 't use a double . so either- - You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret or you listen to how I would do it . The only way that I know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double . All right . Take a good look . Let 's get out there and find me . BORDEN : Whoo ! Look . Look . What 's that ? That is for you . What 's this for ? Come here . - I asked you last week . You said you- - - You caught me in a wrong mood . But you went over all the- - aren 't I ? soon we 'll be in a bigger theater . Things will work out . I can 't believe it . Thank you . Thank you . It 's beautiful . Gerry ? look at you . I 'd like you to meet Gerald Root . ROOT : Hm . A pleasure . Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen . Would you like for me to tell you a little joke ? Come here . There we are . Yes ? Are you laughing now ? I have to take a piss . - He 's out of his mind . - Of course . He 's an out-of-work actor . He 's perfect . He needs a little help ... he could be your brother . I need him to be me . Give me a month . Come around . So you open the door and ... Come on . Ugh ! it 's not for sleeping on . - So if you come down through there ... - Mm-hm . - ... does Root go up through there ? - Yep . Robert . it has to be . Borden 's trick is getting noticed . The place was packed today . You went and saw his show again . Mr. Angier ? All I have to do is keep myself drunk and no one will be able to tell the difference . sir . Mr. Root ? Jesus . you would drink too if you knew the world half as well as I do . Did you think you were unique ? I have been Caesar . I played Faust . How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton ? for nothing . I 'd rather be him for now . I find it amusing . I did deny no prisoners . thank you . the game 's up . I don 't know how you do these things . I 'm not sure I wanna know . Have you thought what we should call the trick ? There 's no point in being coy . Borden calls his trick " The Transported Man . much of what you 've seen tonight may be termed as illusions or entertaining trifles . Alas I cannot claim this next feat as illusion . Watch carefully . You 'll see no trickery for no trickery is employed . Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient and various holy men of the Himalayas . many of you may be familiar with this technique ... do not be alarmed what you 're about to see is considered safe . To our achievement . The manager says he 's never seen a reaction like it . At least he got to see it . I spent the ovation hiding under the stage . No one cares about the man who disappears into the box . They care about the one who comes out . - I care about the man in the box . - Thank you . I don 't know . Maybe- - Maybe we could switch before the trick . I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below . the anticipation of the trick is everything . We need your showmanship to build up the suspense . it 's over . He can 't introduce this trick . Of course I can . I 'm the Great Danton . you bloody fool . Get out of that wardrobe and makeup . Anyone could walk in here at any minute . all . Robbie . We worked hard . We need to celebrate properly . What 's wrong ? Is it your wife ? it 's the trick . It isn 't good enough . Borden 's trick is nothing compared to ours . He has no style . he doesn 't spend the finale hiding under the stage . I need to know how he does it . - Why ? - So I can do it better . I need you to go and work for him . Work for him ? Are you joking ? You 'll be my spy . We just got our start . You want me to leave ? Olivia . but imagine what we could do with the real illusion . We 'd have the greatest magic act anyone 's ever seen . He knows I work for you . Exactly why he 'll wanna hire you . He 'll want my secret . - Why would he trust me ? - Because you 're gonna tell him the truth . Hm ? Good girl . Mr. Angier . It 's fitting you should be here for maiden voyage . Your hat . You might wanna stand back . I don 't understand . Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it . no . - Come back next week . - Next week ? it 'll be fine . - Tesla . She 's just a little temperamental sometimes . we make do . - My name is Olivia Wenscombe- - - I know who you are . You here to steal my show ? I 'm here to give it what it 's missing . - Yeah ? What might that be ? - Me . Bernard ? Woman 's touch . OLIVIA : I 've left Angier . - All right . - I want a job . - Yeah ? - I know you 've no reason to trust me- - - Why wouldn 't I trust you ? you 're only the mistress of my enemy . Why wouldn 't I trust you ? - Mr. Borden- - - Alfred . I 'm going to tell you the truth . Now that is a slippery notion in our line of work ... Miss Wenscombe ? I am here because he sent me here . He wants me to work for you and steal your secret . What does he need my secret for ? His trick is top-notch . He vanishes and then he reappears on the other side of the stage ... very drunk . It 's astonishing . How does he do it ? does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage ? it 's killing him . He 's obsessed with discovering your methods . He thinks of nothing else . and I 've had enough . There is no future with him . but I 've actually come to offer you his . is it ? sir . you 're late and more drunk than usual . get down below stairs right away . - No . Mr. Cutter . We have a problem . Borden is performing right across the street . Yeah ? We have a bigger problem . Root . He 's realized he can make demands . Wha- - ? He 's blackmailing us ? to tell the truth . It usually takes them longer to figure it out . it makes no difference . look at this . look at last week where they said you were the premier stage performer in London . mind you . what 's your point ? is you 've climbed too high to get away with professional embarrassment . We don 't do any tricks we can 't control . Just pay him whatever he wants for now . We keep doing the trick until Borden opens and then we 'll phase it out . All right . ANGIER : Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad . To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale ? shh . but don 't advertise it because I 'll be mobbed with fans . ANGIER : We paid him enough to keep him in beers so you wouldn 't expect him to rock the boat . many of you may be familiar with this technique . do not be alarmed what you 're about to see is considered safe . And who are you ? I am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner . Hm . Very good . if you insist . - Another . - I 'm not performing tonight . I 'm only doing one show ... my people pretty much run things these days . Get up there ! Get up ! The Transported Man I 'm not claiming to know your methods or anything ... and I used a double . Oh . I see . Very good . and then it went bad . was that when I incorporated this bloke into my act he had complete power over me . you say . Oh ! Be very careful giving someone that power over you . thank you . thank you for the warning . Cheers . I cannot claim this next feat as illusion . What you 're about to see is considered safe . Ah ! Oh ! The Great Danton . I apologize . There simply is too much magic for my stage at the Pantages across the street . MAN 1 : Bravo ! MAN 2 : Bravo ! Pardon my intrusion . MAN 3 : Bravo ! BORDEN : And go easy on the poor chap . He does try so very hard . I don 't know how Borden found him . I was careful . he did . Do you think it was her ? You weren 't expecting me ? I was expecting you sooner . Your message said afternoon . It takes a bit for me to get around these days . He 's taken everything from me . now you . What do you mean ? You sent me- - not to improve his act . - That 's my job . - Or fall in love . - I did everything you asked ! - Yes ? Yes ? a double . - Of course Borden said that . - He didn 't say anything . I 've seen things . but I 've seen it backstage . Misdirection . He leaves things around to make you think he 's using a double . All the time ? He doesn 't know when I look . Olivia ! That 's who he is ! That 's what it takes ! He lives his act ! Don 't you see ? Just because you 're sleeping with him doesn 't mean he trusts you . don 't you ? But the Great Danton is a blind fool . His notebook . You stole it ? I borrowed it for tonight . but now- - ANGIER : I can 't . - You can 't ? it 's a cipher . Even with the keyword it would take months to decode . - And without the keyword ? - Perhaps never . - We 'll see . - We will not see . he 'll know I took it . - Leave him . - I can 't . He knows where I live . Olivia . All of his secrets are right here in my hands . Won 't bring your wife back . I care about his secret . Look I 'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in . me . Not you . Understand ? Robert . I have fallen in love with him . Then I know how hard this has been for you . Notebook ? Then he 's just getting started . BORDEN : Good evening . WOMAN 1 : Professor . MAN 1 : Professor . uh ... WOMAN 2 : Could I get your autograph ? I 'm walking tonight . Let him come . I don 't care . MAN 2 : Professor . MAN 3 : Professor . - You all right ? - I 'm alive . Saves me cutting you an air hole . - I 'm impressed . - Why 's that ? You 're finally getting your hands dirty . Angier . Risk . Sacrifice . unless you give me what I want . - Which is ? - Your secret . My secret ? Your method for The Transported Man . Fallon wouldn 't tell me . He doesn 't seem to talk at all . You have my notebook . Useless without the keyword . Mr. Borden . Describe it in full . not the keyword . I don 't even know if your secret 's in your notebook . The keyword is the method . Where 's my ingénieur ? - Alive ? - How fast can you dig ? Fallon ! You hear me ? Fallon ! - How 's the arm ? - Still attached . - Did you find your answer ? - Our answer . I haven 't looked yet . I wanted you to share this . Robert . The same way he always has . The same way as we do . It 's just that you want something more . shall we ? What does it mean ? we have a journey ahead of us . - To America . - Robert ? Listen to me . Obsession is a young man 's game . come on . - I can 't follow you any further in it . I can 't . I 'm sorry . Then the rest is up to me . I 'm sorry . darling . your finest . I didn 't know we were going to be joined for dinner . - Absolutely . We are celebrating . SARAH : Miss Wenscombe . what are we celebrating ? Fallon ? what trick ? I am going to bury myself alive every night and then someone will come along and dig me up . Wonderful . pour- - don 't talk to me like that . I 'm not a child . Mr. Fallon you might escort Miss Wenscombe home . My husband 's being a bore . please . Don 't ruin this evening . Freddy . that 's my name . am I ? couldn 't you have at least taken off the beard ? I just came from the bloody theater just now . All right ? And I 'm out in public . Alfred ? I had a terrible ordeal today . I thought that something very precious had been lost to me . So I just wanted to celebrate . Just a little . what ? What did you lose ? more secrets . secrets are my life . stop . This isn 't you . Stop performing . Mr. Brent . Unexpected guests . Not very polite . A lot of questions . First I thought they might work for the government . - No ? - Worse . They work for Thomas Edison . a most curious development . His assistant came to us with a proposition . Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much . Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage ? but I 've actually come to offer you his . is it ? that 's what he told me to tell you . The truth ... and he sent me to you like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts . I hate him for that . I can spot Angier 's methods from the back of the theater . what could you possibly have to offer me ? but you can 't understand why no one can see yours are better . You hide this . I had to look very closely to spot it when you perform The Transported Man but this makes you unique . It shows the audience you aren 't using a double . display it proudly . I 'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand . it does . So let people know . and I can show you how . BORDEN : I think she 's telling the truth . I think we cannot trust her . But I love her . I need her . To open myself to such a relationship to the dangers of such an affair I need assurances of fidelity . Of love . But how to be sure ? I know a way . It 's the only way to know her mind . How could he send you away ? BORDEN : She must help me rid ourselves of Angier . my mistress proves her truthfulness . you understand . I 've been convinced since she led me to Root . Angier . Angier . She gave you this notebook at my request . not to my trick . Did you really think I ' d part with my secret so easily after so much ? Angier . May you find solace for your thwarted ambition back in your American home . Tesla ! Tesla ! Alley ! Alley ! Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for . - We never said he had . - But you let me believe that he had . You stole my money because your funding had been cutoff . laughing at me all along while using my money to stave off ruin . I have seen Edison 's men . - Where ? In the hotel . And I have every mind to bring them up here myself . Mr. Angier . It is true that you are our last remaining financier but we have not stolen your money . my cat . I spoke a simple truth . Mr. Angier is not an exact science . The machine simply does not operate as expected . It requires further examination . - So where did my top hat go ? - Nowhere . We tried the damn thing a dozen times . The hat went nowhere . TESLA : We need to try different material . It may provoke a different result . come on . doctor . I hope that whatever you were doing with my money was more worthwhile Mr. Tesla . Alley ! So the machine was working . I never bothered to check the calibration because the hat never moved . Mr. Angier . That 's one of the principal beauties of science . I 'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine . We 'll send word when it 's ready . Don 't forget your hat . Mr. Angier . You look so pretty in this new dress of yours . Are we going to the zoo this afternoon ? no . Daddy has some errands to run . did I ? Then go to the zoo we shall . So Daddy will go run his errands and I 'll be back before you know it so you go get ready . We 'll go see those chimpanzees . Sarah . What are you doing ? We each of us have our vices . whatever you may think your only competition for my affections is our little girl . I love you . I will always love you and you alone . - You mean it today . - Absolutely . Which makes it so much harder when you don 't . BORDEN : Is that more shopping ? She does love the smell of money . so I thought you could take her . I can do it tomorrow if not . she knows . at least she knows that something 's not right so if you can just do whatever you can to help me with her . Talk to her . Just convince her that I do love her . please . there 's sometimes ... - Sometimes it seems wrong . - I 've told you before ... you 're with me . Leave your family at home where they belong . I 'm trying . Olivia . - I 'll get dressed . - Yeah . I saw Fallon hanging around again . There 's something about that man I don 't trust . You trust me ? Then trust Fallon . He protects the things that I care about . Mr. Angier . We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave as well . He was very good to Colorado Springs . Mr. Angier I didn 't think it was necessary to tell Edison 's men about the box . What box ? TESLA : I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye but I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado . The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry . Perhaps you 'll find more luck in your field where people are happy to be mystified . You will find what you are looking for in this box . Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions . I add only one suggestion on using the machine : Destroy it . Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean . Such a thing will bring you only misery . ANGIER : Tesla 's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be . I tested the machine taking precautions in case Tesla hadn 't ironed out the kinks in its operation . I would not wanna live like that for long . Borden . Borden . Sitting there in your cell ... awaiting your death for my murder . that 's a fake . it 's not . The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt . of which we had numerous examples . It don 't matter . So my tricks . - All of them . - Including The Transported Man ? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased indeed . he won 't . Because they 're not complete . It 's just the Pledge and the Turn for each . Without the Prestige for these tricks ... - ... these are worthless . - Yeah . You get the rest of it when you bring my daughter here . I wanna say goodbye . SARAH : We have to go through it now . listen to me . Deny it all you want . Olivia means nothing . - Olivia ? - I need an assistant . I 'll go to her . - I 'll tell her I know- - - Tell her what ? Alfred . I ... Sarah . - I can 't keep it in . - You can 't talk like this . shut up . shut up ! I don 't wanna hear it anymore ! You can 't talk like this ! I know . I know what you really are ! Alfred I can 't live like this . you think I can live like this ? You think I bloody enjoy living like this ? SARAH : Stop it and listen ! No ! BORDEN : We have this beautiful house ... we 're married . What is so wrong with your life ? I can 't live like this ! what do you want from me ? I want ... I want you to be honest with me . No tricks no lies and no secrets . Do you- - ? Do you love me ? Not today . No . Who 's there ? I 'm looking for an old friend . ANGIER : I heard about a booking . Nice little theater . Good up-and-coming magician . John . Good rehearsal space . I like it . You always had a good eye for publicity . John . It 's my last show . A limited engagement . Your last show ? A wise man once told me obsession was a young man 's game . I 'm almost done . There 's one thing left . The Real Transported Man . You wanna design a show around it . managing . I need you to call in favors or connections you have . - Get us the right booking for the run . - What sort of booking you after ? The sort that Borden can 't ignore . sir . You said you only wanted to show me one trick . It piqued my interest . Mr. Ackerman . ANGIER : Pleased to meet you . shall we ? gentlemen . Very pretty . Cutter ? He simply disappears ? he has to come back . There has to be a- - ANGIER : A Prestige ? - Exactly . Pardon me . It 's very rare to see real magic . - It 's been many years since I 've seen- - ANGIER : Are you interested in helping us ? Yes . But you 'll have to dress it up a little . Disguise it . Give them enough reason to doubt it . Freddy . Not once . Why would I talk about her to you ? Because she was a part of your life . And now she 's gone . she said she wanted to meet me . That she had something to tell me about you . I couldn 't bring myself to face her . But what would she have said ? You wanna know the truth about me ? Truth is that I never loved Sarah . I never loved her . yes . Part of me . but the other part didn 't . The part that found you . The part that 's sitting here right now . I love you . I love you . That 's the truth . That is the truth that matters . You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now talking about me that way . - No . - Yes . It 's inhuman to be so cold . He 's back . After two years . He 's got a new trick . They 're saying it 's the best London 's ever seen . Professor . You should go to him . You two deserve each other . they 'll be playing through next year . Then get rid of them . There 'll be a hundred performances . no less . Five performances a week . No matinees . And that 's what you 'll be charging for each ticket . Good day . my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk . Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocably damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now . For when I tell you the young lady who taught me this illusion actually died performing it you will understand the seriousness of the dangers involved . Let 's begin . I have seen the future and it is a strange future indeed . ladies and gentlemen is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities . What you 're about to witness is not magic . It is purely science . I would like to invite you to come up on-stage now so that you can examine the machine for yourselves . Man 's reach exceeds his imagination . MAN 1 : Bravo ! MAN 2 : Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo . Bravo . One hundred performances . Why ? Does his method dictate that ? Is it a publicity move ? What is it ? and they 're calling him the bloody best in England . Why ? Fifty yards in a second . In a second ! And all that we know is he uses a trap door . Brilliant . What is going on under that stage ? Huh ? Why can 't you outthink him ? yeah ? We 're done . All right ? Let him have his trick . I don 't need- - I don 't need his secret . So ... you leave him alone . just leave him alone . We 're done . John I don 't want you backstage on this one . ANGIER : I would like to invite you to come up on-stage now so that you can examine the machine for yourselves . you fool . Who was that ? Hey ! Where 's the bloody key ? Where 's the bloody key ? Where 's the bloody key ? Bloody drowning ! Hold on ! Ah ! What have you done ? you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier . You will be hanged by the neck until dead . May the Lord have mercy on your soul . OWENS : Mr. Cutter ? Owens . Mr. Owens . It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier 's equipment . But I noticed from this manifest that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items . surely you- - no . It 's just there is one particular item ... that I would like to- - - You would like to ... ? - Buy . I suppose so . - This is the machine ? - Yes . I 'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about purchasing this particular item . Do you think I could talk to Lord Caldlow in person ? I 'm afraid . Of course ... in the course of your delivery arrangements your paths were to cross ... - ... I can 't stop you speaking your mind . - Thank you . Borden ? - For now . Got a visitor . Lord Caldlow . With a little girl . Jess ? my love . How are you ? I 've missed you so much . And Fallon 's missed you too . We both have . can I come in there ? darling . but everything is gonna be all right . - You must be Lord Caldlow . - Caldlow . I am . I always have been . Alfred . Don 't they know you can 't escape without your little rubber ball ? I pulled you out . Out of that tank . All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician but you couldn 't leave me alone . I don 't know what you 've done ... are you ? not anymore . And I win . the man who disappears . You win ? this is my little girl 's life . And don 't you dare put her in the middle of this . I know how hard it is to have someone so special ... Borden ? can you ? she 'll be looked after . stop . Look . Here . That 's what you 're after . That 's what this is about . Take it . - Your secret ? - Yeah . You always were the better magician . We both know that . you have to agree mine is better . Jess . I 'm gonna take you home soon . I promise . Borden . - I promise . Look . I promise . Jess . I love you . ANGIER : Come on . Jess . Angier . Angier ! you think this place can hold me ? Angier ! They 're gonna bloody hang me ! They 're gonna bloody hang me ! You can put a stop to this now ! - Listen ! Listen ! That man- - ! GUARD : Just shut up . that man is the one I 'm meant to have killed ! listen to me ! I 'm not guilty ! GUARD : Guards ! - I 'm not guilty ! - I don 't care ! Get hold of him ! Professor . - Angier ! Run along now . Sir . There 's a gentleman waiting . CUTTER : Dear God . Cutter . You 're- - You 're still alive . Robert ? for God 's sake . sir . Jess . CUTTER : I 've seen her before . I saw her in court with Fallon . she needs looking after . She needs her father . and I helped you . I came here to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine . I am not gonna beg you for anything . You don 't have to . I 'm gonna make sure that machine 's never used again . Lord Caldlow where do you want me to deliver it ' ? My theater . It belongs with the Prestige materials . I tried not to involve you . So we go alone now . Both of us . Only I don 't have as far to go as you . No . I should have left him to his damn trick . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for a lot of things . I 'm sorry about Sarah . I didn 't mean to hurt her . I didn 't . all right ? You live for both of us . Goodbye . Are you watching closely ? Put it down the end . Take a minute to consider your achievement . I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me . he said it was like going home . I was lying . He said it was agony . WARDEN : Alfred Borden ... in the name of the king and the High Court of England you will meet your end . No one cares about the man in the box . Cutter ? Cutter ? WARDEN : Do you have anything to say ? Abracadabra . A brother . A twin . You were Fallon the whole time . No . We were both Fallon . And we were both Borden . Were you- - ? Were you the one who went into the box or the one who came back out ? We took turns . The trick is where we would swap . Cutter knew . Cutter knew . too easy . No . but not easy . There 's nothing easy about two men sharing one life . Ah ! I don 't understand how it can be bleeding again . What about Olivia ? And your wife ? We each loved one of them . I loved Sarah . He loved Olivia . which was enough for us . Just But not for them . that 's the price of a good trick . would you ? I 've made sacrifices . - No . - Yes . It takes nothing to steal another man 's work . It takes everything . wait ! I 'm the- - ! It took courage . It took courage to climb into that machine every night not knowing if I 'd be the man in the box or in the Prestige . Do you wanna- - ? Do you wanna see what it cost me ? did you ? Look . Look . I don 't care . You went halfway around the world . You spent a fortune . You did terrible things . Robert . And all for nothing . - For nothing ? - Yeah . You never understood why we did this . The audience knows the truth . The world is simple . It 's miserable . Solid all the way through . even for a second then you could make them wonder . And then you ... Then you got to see something very special . You really don 't know ? It was- - It was the look on their faces . CUTTER : Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts . The first part is called the Pledge The magician shows you something ordinary . The second act is called the Turn The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it into something extraordinary . But you wouldn 't clap yet because making something disappear isn 't enough . You have to bring it back . Hey . CUTTER : Now you 're looking for the secret . you 're not really looking . You don 't really want to work it out . You want to be fooled . \ fscx125 \ fscy125 ) \ cH000000 \ 3cc0c0c0 } SubRip by \ fscx125 \ fscy125 ) \ cH000000f \ 3c0000a6 } HighCode

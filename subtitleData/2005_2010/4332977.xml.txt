 The world will have to deal with us . Previously on The 4400 : These shots are free . Give them to anyone who wants them . But be careful to explain the risks . Handing out promicin like candy changes everything . Nobody can predict what 's gonna happen once people everywhere start developing abilities . - April . - How 's it going , sibling ? April Skouris . Black sheep of the family . You don 't know this girl at all . The whole time we were planning our wedding , you were working with Ryland . Betraying me . - Where 's the promicin ? - Get your hands off of me . Yeah , he 's stable . That 's the good news . But he hasn 't regained consciousness . They don 't know when he will . I have a job offer in Spain . If you come with me ... If Collier 's right , if moving into this new world of his means more upheaval in the here and now , I 'm gonna find myself a place where I can live at peace with my daughter as long as I can . Alana 's picture 's gone out to every hospital and law enforcement agency . Nobody 's seen her , Tom . I 'm sorry . Hey , Kyle . You ready ? Come on , buddy . It 's starting soon . You think I 'd be late for this ? - I 'm as psyched as you are , Dad . - Good . Let 's do it then . Tom . Tom . - I saved you some seats . - Sorry . - Hey , Tom . - Hey , Maia . - You look nice . - Thank you . - Hey , Tom . - You 'd be late , so I held things up . Yeah . - Hey , guys . - Hey , how are you doing ? - Hey , how are you ? - Hi . - Hi , Tess . Hi , honey . - It 's good to see you . - Kevin . - How are you ? I thought you 'd never make it . Well , I had a little help . Thank you . Thank you . I appreciate the applause , even though I know who it 's really for . We 're all here to give thanks to one man . A man who took a dark and dangerous world and healed it . A man who eliminated disease and war , and changed our ideas of what it is to be a human being . He made 4400 abilities available to everyone and all of our lives are better for it . Some call him a savior . Some call him a messiah . He 's all that and more . Ladies and gentlemen , Mr. Jordan Collier . Today , this morning , here and everywhere , it is good to be alive . United , like humanity has never been united . Through promicin , the gift I brought you and that you accepted . Together we have created heaven on Earth . A time of joy , endless joy that we share as one . And for that , I say let us bow our heads in thanks . Jordan ? Jordan . It 's okay . It was a dream . You were dreaming . Again . What was it about this time ? L ... I handed out the promicin . I stopped the catastrophe . Well , it 's the right thing to do . We saved the future for ... I know what kind of world I prevented . But is the world I created any better ? More , please . That is so disgusting . You said you wouldn 't do that in front of me anymore . It 's gross . It 's not disgusting . It 's ... It 's love . And one day you 'll understand . So , Mommy , when are you gonna tell us ? - Tell us what ? - Mommy got the job offer . The job with the European Union came through ? She 'll be advising them on all things 4400 . They said we could live anywhere in the EU . The benefit package is unbelievable . Wow , okay . Is there anything the job doesn 't come with ? Yeah . A gun . Which makes it just about perfect . If I take this , that means that we 're not just on vacation anymore . I mean , we have to settle down somewhere . So how about it ? Is everyone ready to put down some roots ? Kyle . - Hey , Dad . - When did you get back into town ? - Why didn 't you call me ? - Honestly ? The way things left off , I wasn 't sure you wanted to hear from me . Kyle , you said you wanted some distance . I was trying to respect that . But you should know , you can talk to me anytime . I start this new job tomorrow . It 's a legal aid thing . Helping out the 4400 . I was gonna get a hotel , you know , while I looked for an apartment . But it just seemed kind of stupid , you being here all by yourself , you know ? Still no word on Alana ? No . - I could use some company . - Yeah . I 'm sorry she 's gone , Dad . I really liked her . And she loved you . I know . L ... I keep hoping that I 'll come home someday and she 's just gonna be here . I 'm gonna go unpack . Is that all right ? I wanna go see Shawn later . Kyle . Welcome home . Thanks . The good news is I 'm not dead . I took the shot three days ago and I 'm still here . The bad news ? I can 't blow things up with my mind , or fly , or do anything differently at all . I 'm still just me . Graham , a. k. a . No one . Okay , so I kind of want to go to the prom with Jeff . - But I was thinking ... - Amber . - You know ... - Amber . He 's such a stupid kid . All right , guys . Get in here . Time to pick teams . Come on , move it . Line up over here , guys . Come on , man . You 're always the last one . Hurry up . I 'll take Graham . I want Graham . Me ? Wait a minute . I 'm taking Graham . Guys , come on . Stop messing with me . Everyone knows I suck at basketball . Listen up . If Graham doesn 't wanna shoot hoops , then hoops is off the menu . How about it , Graham ? What do you wanna play ? You ... You 're serious ? Absolutely . We can play whatever you want . Just tell us what to do . - Thumb wrestling ? - All right . Thumb wrestling it is . And pair up . You two over here . Come on . Come on ! Move it ! You two guys over here . Mike , you and Billy over here . What 's going on ? Say hello to the new head of NTAC . I don 't get it . Woman doesn 't have a single day of law-enforcement experience . She works in a think tank for a few years , so they give her a gun and a badge , tell her to play sheriff ? I heard she managed the flow of refugees after the hurricanes in Texas . And did a good job of it too . She 's a political appointment . Smiled at the right person at some cocktail party so they passed over all the qualified people . Oh , and Tom ? She said she wanted to see you as soon as you got in . - Hi . I 'm ... - Tom Baldwin . I know . Meghan Doyle . - Hi . - Does that look straight to you ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , sure . It , it looks good . - You must like subtitles . - Have you ever seen La Dolce Vita ? Honestly , no . I 'm getting the distinct impression no one else around here has either . But that 's okay . You should check it out , though . - Okay , I 'll do that . - Relax , Tom . It 's not homework . Please , come sit down . There 's something I want you to see . Something to get us off on the right foot . Open it . It 's interesting . - I 'm not cleared to read this . - Of course . But I 've read your file . You don 't seem like the kind of agent who 'd let that bother you . Go ahead . I won 't tell if you won 't . This is about Isabelle Tyler . Why are you showing me this ? She can have visitors now . I figured you might wanna see her . I know you 've been looking for Alana Mareva for three months . I also know that you 're at a dead end . You must 've considered the possibility that she was abducted again . Of course . People don 't just fall off the edge of the planet . Isabelle Tyler is the one person alive with a tangible connection to the future . If they did take Alana , maybe Isabelle will be able to tell you something . You sure this isn 't gonna blow back on you ? You just started . - I don 't wanna get you in trouble . - If I succeed in this job , if I bring in Jordan Collier , no one 's gonna mind if a few rules are broken along the way . And if I don 't , no amount of toeing the line will save me . I appreciate this . Thanks . You know those posters ? If you have a taste for foreign films , people think you 're intellectual or a radical . The truth is I just like the movies . You sure you don 't like that they make people uncomfortable ? Maybe that too . Hey , buddy . Can you hear me ? Hey . My dad says when I was in a coma , he used to talk to me all the time . I don 't remember any of it , but who knows ? Maybe it helped . I wish there was something I could do for you . I tried . Three months ago I took the shot . I was so scared but I just did it anyway . I was thinking maybe I could wake you up , same as you did it for me . Wanna to hear the punch line ? Nothing happened . Three months , no ability , nothing . I mean nothing . Nothing 's changed at all really . That 's weird , huh ? I tried . I 'm sorry . Hello ? Excuse me ? Are you lost ? Help me . Help me . There are dead people everywhere I go . They hate me . I made them dead . We made them dead . Tess , we gave them a choice . We didn 't force the shots on anyone . Tess , I want you to take your medication . All right ? Lt 'll make you feel better . Come on . Come on . Kevin . She 'll calm down once she 's had her pills . Is that your medical opinion ? Tess is schizophrenic . The strain of hiding out , the guilt over what we did , she can 't handle it . It 's caused her to break . She needs medical care - beyond what we can provide . - Till I find a doctor sympathetic to us , you 'll have to administer her medications yourself . Just remember , Tess ' ability is what keeps you safe . If it wasn 't for her , you 'd have been arrested a long time ago . And I promise you , I don 't care if the fate of the world is at stake . I will not sacrifice Tess to you . Or your cause . Our cause , Kevin . Ours . Hey , guys . What 's up ? All of us were talking . And we just want you to know , we 're with you . All of us . We believe . - In what ? - In you . We 're not the only ones . We brought someone . Oh , my God . Amber ? What are you doing here ? I came to be with you . What the hell is going ... ? Whoa , Amber . Wait a minute . You know those shots you always hear about on the news ? I took them . I think maybe it 's screwing you guys up . No , Graham . It 's you . We wanna be close to you . We wanna be close to the light . - What light ? - The one that shines out of you . I didn 't see it until today . But now I do . It 's beautiful . You 're beautiful . Are you sure you wanna do this ? They told you to kill me . You didn 't do it . Did you ever think maybe that 's why your girlfriend 's gone ? - It 's your punishment . - Is that something you think ? Or is that something you know ? How 's Shawn ? Any change ? No . He 's in a regular hospital now . Long-term care . What about my father ? Has anybody heard from him ? No . He 's on our list , and we 'll find him . Now , Isabelle , if you know anything about Alana , please , tell me . Just tell me , please . You wanna have hope , don 't you ? You wanna believe she 's coming back . Of course . Then you don 't wanna know what I know . I 'm sorry , Tom . I really am , but they used you . The same way they used me . Hey , Diana . It 's me . Marco . - Are you having a good time in Spain ? - Yeah , hey , Marco . Yeah . No , everything 's good . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm good . Something came up , though . A couple days ago , some agents raided an apartment . There was a lot of promicin there . One of the guys they brought in gave up a whole bunch of names , you know , people they 'd given syringes to . Okay , so , what is it you wanna tell me , Marco ? One of the names was April Skouris . My sister took the shots ? The guy didn 't know if she injected them but she definitely had them . - Have you heard from her ? - No , I haven 't heard from her in months . She didn 't call me on my birthday but I figured , April , you know ? Yeah , I remember . Look , I 'm sorry , Di . I just ... You know , I thought you should know . I appreciate it . Thanks . Bye . You 're going back to Seattle , aren 't you ? That used to be a statue of our namesake . Last night , a dozen students tore it down and put that thing up . When we asked them why , they said it was a statue of Graham Holt . Who 's Graham Holt ? He 's a junior . C student . Basically unremarkable in every way . So this kid pulls a prank and you call NTAC ? I called NTAC because I think maybe this kid took some of those shots . I mean , what 's going on around here isn 't normal , the posters , the statues . Last night our valedictorian revised her application essay to Stanford . She read it to her guidance counselor this morning . It 's 500 words on how Graham Holt is the most important spiritual leader since the time of Christ . I called him into my office earlier this morning . He claims to have no idea about what 's going on . I think we need to meet this Graham Holt . From now on everyone 's favorite band is TV on the Radio . You got that ? TV on the Radio . - They 're the best band out there . - Excuse me . Excuse me , Graham . These gentlemen would like to have a word with you . I 'm Agent Baldwin . This is Agent Garrity . We work at NTAC . We 're gonna have to ask you to come with us . We 're gonna bring you in to NTAC and give you a test to see if you 're promicin positive . - Why ? - Look around you , Graham . - I think you know why . - Do I have a choice ? You have a choice whether or not you do it in handcuffs . If you haven 't taken the shot , you don 't have to worry . Come on . You 're sitting in my spot . I didn 't realize these benches were assigned . Well , they are . Literally . I 'm in my first year at the institute . Art and Design . I 'm supposed to do a charcoal sketch of a view from the park every day for seven days . You 're in my spot . Okay . I 'll move . - I 'll move . - Thanks , Kyle . I appreciate that . How do you know my name ? Honestly ? I recognized you as soon as I walked up . I read a lot about the 4400 . Which means I read a lot about you . So you know all about me and Jordan Collier , huh ? Yeah , I do . Kind of hard to avoid . Well , you know it wasn 't me who shot him , right ? Not really me . I didn 't really believe it was you . You didn 't look like a killer to me . Well , I guess that 's a kind-of compliment . Thank you . I have to get back to work but good luck with your assignment . Cassie Dunleavy . Maybe I 'll see you around . I 'll be here for the next seven days . It seems to me there 's a very simple explanation for what 's going on at Stevenson High . This kid , Graham , took the promicin shot . And now everyone who meets him thinks he 's God . Come on . I 've heard you tend to move directly to the point , Marco . - But , really ? God ? - Well , obviously , he 's not " the God . " At best , he 's a god . A minor deity . Whatever . These kids are building effigies of him . They 're willing to fight us to protect him . Sounds like worship to me . You guys are lucky you weren 't turned . Seems like you only need minutes around Graham - before you find religion . - Maybe they 're unlucky . Absolute devotion is a rarity in the modern age . It might bring a sense of purpose to life . - A clarity . - Guys , what do we do with this kid ? I 'm going back with more people . We isolate him . - Hope the effects wear off . - Yeah , but I 'd do it fast . It sounds like Graham 's pretty much focused on being king of the school . I mean , imagine what happens if he learns to think a little more ambitiously . What the hell is that ? Are you here to give yourselves , body and soul , to Graham Holt ? Not exactly . Then I suggest you leave . These streets are his . And we 'll defend them with our lives . You just take your men around that way . This is me . Graham . - What do you want ? - I want you to end this , Graham . If you don 't come out , people will get hurt . - Is that what you want ? - No . Of course not . These people are just trying to protect me . You 're forcing them to be here . You 've taken away their free will . - Their lives are in your hands . - I understand . I don 't want anything bad to happen to them either . But you just need to give me some time . Like , a night to figure this out , okay ? One night . I just bought us some time . We 've got planning to do . Hey . Try not to look so gloomy , okay ? And who knows ? She might not even be able to get into Seattle . She 'll be right back here in a couple hours . She 's never coming back here . She said she is , Maia . And I really need to believe that . So , Kyle , tell me . Do you ever go visit your cousin Shawn ? There hasn 't been much in the paper about him lately . - Is he getting any better ? - No , he 's not . Which is weird because there 's no reason why he shouldn 't be awake . His brain 's active . His vital signs are okay . That 's so sad . - He seemed like a really good guy . - Everyone has just given up . Settling in for the long haul . Didn 't I read something about the promicin in his system ? - Doctors think it 's all out of whack ? - That 's right . They think that 's why ... His body 's shut down . But I don 't think that made it into the papers . Well , it must have . How else would I know about it ? Okay . I know I 'm not a doctor , but maybe someone should try injecting him with a big old dose of promicin . It 'd be like giving him a jumpstart , right ? Shawn 's a 4400 . - Probably wouldn 't hurt him . - Yeah , I 've thought about that . The doctors won 't even consider it . Promicin is seriously illegal . Too bad you can 't get your hands on any . You might be the only person in his life who cares enough to actually take a shot at waking him up . They 've just been standing here , staring at us , for hours . Don 't they ever have to use the bathroom ? Heads up . Don 't shoot . My name 's Graham Holt . I wanna surrender . It 's about time . Hands up . Keep your hands up . All right , on your knees . Easy . It 's not him . - It 's not Holt . - Don 't shoot . - My name 's Graham Holt . - On your knees . Now . On your knees . Don 't shoot . - I 'm Graham Holt . - I 'm Graham Holt . I 'm Graham Holt . I 'm Graham Holt . I 'm Graham Holt . - I 'm Graham Holt . - I 'm Graham Holt . I 'm Graham Holt . I 'm Graham Holt . Don 't fight me . Join me . Hey , everyone . My name is Graham Holt . I just wanted to say , you have nothing to be afraid of . Believing in me doesn 't make you a different person . You 'll still love your family . You 'll still wake up in the morning and go do whatever it is you do . You 'll just have more purpose . - And everyone will believe ... - Tess . - exactly what you do . And you 'll believe what they do . Tess ! - It 's gonna be very cool . I promise . - She 's gone . - Open up your hearts and let me in . - She left in the night . Hey , everyone . My name is Graham Holt . - Did you hear me ? She 's gone . - I just wanted to say ... - Jordan . ... nothing to be afraid of . What are you doing ? We have to find her before someone picks her up . You 'll have to go without me . What do you mean " go without you " ? - This is Tess . You owe her . - I did not give out promicin to the world to have it unite under a 16-year-old boy . you 'll believe what they do . He has to be stopped . It 's all gonna be very cool . I promise . I see . You 're having messiah-envy . How are you gonna stop him , Jordan ? - My name is Graham Holt . - Anybody who gets near that kid winds up praying to him . What makes you any different ? And even if you could get close to him , what do you expect to happen ? A miracle ? I guess I need one , don 't I ? you 'll just have more purpose . And everyone will believe exactly what you do . And then , you 'll believe what they do . It 's all gonna be very cool . I promise . Are you guys nuts ? I 'm an NTAC agent . We 're on the same side . Move , right now . Hey , come on . Come on . - Guys . Guys . - Hey . Hey . Hey . Hey . - They 're arresting everybody at NTAC . - What are you talking about ? Why ? Our orders are to bring you all downtown , sir . Graham wants to bring NTAC into the fold . Fine . Fine . Sounds good . What choice do we have , huh ? - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Graham converted a couple police stations . The cops are arresting people , bringing them to him by the hundreds . I 'm the king of Seattle . Why aren 't you picking up the phone ? It 's dangerous outside right now . Now call me back . - Still no word from your son ? - No . What did D.C. Say ? Nothing good . They 're already talking about acceptable losses , air strikes , sending an army division into the city . They 'll invade an American city ? Sounds like civil war . I know . The best I could do is buy us a couple of hours . - To do what ? - We have to gather everyone from NTAC that hasn 't been converted . Make our way downtown . Fight our way downtown , if we have to . We 'll try and get close to Graham . We 'll see if we can get to him before he gets to us . - Oh , God . Shawn . What happened ? - I don 't know . He was just lying there and he started convulsing . Shawn . Oh , my God . Hey , come on . Hey , Shawn . Hey . Hey , it 's us . It 's Kyle . - Shawn . - Say something if you 're okay . Come on . Mom ? How did I get here ? Mr. Collier , you did the right thing coming to me . It would have been a shame if I had to track you down . It seems the world is falling at your feet . - I wanted to see why . - Don 't worry . Soon it 's all gonna make perfect sense to you . No . I gave you promicin . I can take it away . What happened ? What did you do to me ? I made you ordinary . Shoot him . Shoot him now . Justin . Mark . The world doesn 't need you anymore . It has me . Get on with your lives . Graham shouldn 't have converted so many cops . One of his former followers arrested him on the steps of the courthouse . And there 's no trace of promicin in his system ? Nothing ? No . He 's just a high school kid with a lot to answer for . I guess we can all stop wondering if Collier has an ability . He can neutralize promicin . I don 't get it . Shawn never said anything about Collier doing that to one of the original 4400 . Maybe it doesn 't work on them . Maybe he can only do it to the Extra Crispies . Extra Crispies . You know , like , not the Original Recipe 4400 . People who took the promicin shot and then got an ability . So Collier walked into what was essentially an occupied Seattle , laid hands on this kid , and solved a problem that had the entire U.S. Government in a panic . If I was home , watching this story on the 6 : 00 news , you wanna know what I 'd be thinking ? People were praying to the wrong guy . Collier just posted a message on the Internet . We all had a scare today . We 'll have others before we 're done . We ... We are walking a difficult and a dangerous path but we 're walking it together . Whether you 've chosen to join me or not , we 're all , every one of us , making history now . Tom . I got a call from the warden at Kurland Prison . There 's a message for you from Isabelle Tyler . That 's it ? The Powell Museum ? She said your answer 's there and you 'll know it when you see it . The time for sitting on the fence is over . The time for greatness is now . Each of you has a role to play . Your only choice is whether you accept it or have it thrust upon you . Promicin is out there . People are gaining abilities and nothing can be done about that . Sorry , sir . There 's no student named Cassie Dunleavy registered here . She told me she was a student here , okay . I need to talk to her . I can 't find her in the phone book , anywhere . Maybe she didn 't give you her real name . Have you thought of that ? The genie will not go back into the bottle . I know it 's tempting to think that we can hold onto the past and everything that 's safe and easy . But we cannot . And safe and easy are what set us on the path to catastrophe in the first place . The chains of comfort are what keep us from reaching for a better world . This new era . It 's not coming . It 's not on the way . It 's here . And we are now separated from our old lives by a gulf that can never again be bridged . So all of you out there need to ask yourself one thing . Are you ready ?

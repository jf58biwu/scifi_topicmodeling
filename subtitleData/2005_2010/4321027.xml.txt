 ARTIE : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... So you know . It 's MacPherson . I 'm right . Yes , I 'm afraid you are . ( SIGHS ) And he now has a sword which renders him invisible . Now it 's up to you to stop him . ( GRUNTS ) You always hurt the one you love . PETE : Artie ! No ! No , no ! ( GROANING ) Okay , just stop . Okay ? Stop and think this through . Uh , guess what ? I 'm still taking the artifact . I can 't let you do that , Pete . Turn around . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( EXHALES ) ARTIE : No , MacPherson is alive . And he 's loose somewhere in the world . Stopping MacPherson is not your job . My what ? Protecting the world happens to be my job , and right now , that is being threatened by an insane ex-Warehouse agent who is competing for artifacts that belong right out there . Mrs. Frederic said that she would handle it . I can do it . Artie , he ran a sword through your chest . I 'm all right . You could have died . Please , just let Mrs. Frederic handle it , okay ? This ... This is your job , Artie , and you 're not doing it . You have Pete , Myka and Claudia spread out through the Warehouse taking inventory for you day after day . Meanwhile , all of ... Yeah , all these things are piling up . Yes , they are . All right . Hey , hey , hey , hey . I 'm pretty hard to kill . ( MACHINE BEEPING ) Pete ? PETE : Yeah ? Really ? What 's all this ? Pete ? ( GRUNTS ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Nice one . Did not see that coming . Hey . Playing with yourself again ? ( SIGHING ) One game . A quickie . We got time . Besides , none of this stuff 's going anywhere . Right , buddy ? Okay , this stuff is dangerous , all right ? ( CHUCKLING ) All right . This is Lewis Carroll 's mirror . Alice in Wonderland , " Off with their heads . " That 's chick lit right ? Chick lit . ( SCOFFS ) Right . I mean , come on , not everything in here is dangerous . You got that cuddly , little ferret from a cooking pot . Yeah . He peed in my shoes . That was ... That was me . That 's funny . So , what , are you still mad at Artie ? No . No . I 'm not . I 'm not mad at Artie . No , I 'm mad at you . No , you 're not mad at me . Yes , I am . You 're not mad at me . You 're not mad at me , because when you 're mad at me , your neck gets all longer until you 're like that . It 's like a giraffe or whatever . And then when you 're mad at Artie , your neck gets all over here to the right . ( LAUGHS ) Yes . Just like that . ( SIGHING ) Look , I know the MacPherson-DC thing is still bugging you , okay , but everybody has a past . MYKA : But he lied , Pete . Artie 's past is treasonous , hazardous and , hey , there 's a crazy man who wants us dead and he wants the Warehouse all for himself . It would have been nice knowing that going in , Pete . Artie should have told us about MacPherson . Yes , yes , I get it . Daddy issues . ( SCOFFS ) ( CHUCKLES ) Can 't deal with the old man . You 're an ... Oh , my God , the mirror . I got it ! Watch out ! ( EXCLAIMING ) Oh , wait ! Look , big , shiny thing . Pete ! ( DISCO MUSIC PLAYING ) Sick ! ARTIE : Let 's ... That sounds like ... ( DISCO MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING ) ( GROANS ) The Studio 54 disco ball . ( SIGHS ) God , I hate disco . ( SIGHING ) Okay . Whoa ! Okay . Oh , God . Myka , are you okay ? ARTIE : Hey ! What 's going on ? Myka , are you okay ? What 's going on ? Huh ? Ask him . ( STAMMERING ) You can 't ... You can 't ... This is just ... LEENA : I know you 're feeling lost . What ? Artie 's past , MacPherson . It can be a bit disorienting . I know . I feel pretty clear , actually . If things are the way they are , don 't fight it , just go with it . Whenever I don 't , I always end up right back in the same place , not a good one . Thank you for the tea . You 're welcome . Hi . ARTIE : Hey . I 'm gonna do it . I 'm doing it . I 'm doing it . Okay . Um ... They 're excellent , yeah . I don 't know what ... Ooh ! Mmm ! So , today 's ... Where is he ? Pete ? In the room , please . You do something different with your hair ? Mmm-mmm . ARTIE : Would you help me with this bag ? CLAUDIA : I don 't care about your high score , dude . Dude , take your meds . I want a turn , bro . Pete , sit . PETE : I know . I know . I know . ( VIDEO GAME BEEPING ) You saved at least ? I saved . Thank you . ARTIE : Focus . Focus . ( STUTTERING ) What are you doing here ? Focusing . ( PETE CHUCKLING ) No , no , no , no , no . You don 't ... We 're gonna ... We ... You ... ( SIGHS ) All right , never mind . Fine . Just try ... Try to pay attention . Gary and Jillian Whitman , take one each , aka , more aliases than I even care to mention . They are small-time thieves who have inexplicably hit the big time . I smell artifacts . I smell a loser . PETE : No . Come on . MYKA : Claudia . Claudia . ( CHUCKLES ) Let 's let Artie get through this so we can just not be here any longer than necessary , all right ? Thank you very much , Myka . Much appreciated . You 're welcome . ( VIDEO GAME BEEPS ) So , what is this , um ... What is this artifact ? I don 't know . It 's unconfirmed , but if there is one , it 's giving these two an unbelievable amount of luck , the kind that defies all the laws of probability . They 've had winning streaks in Miami , Detroit and Atlantic City and they 've not ... Not one single gaming commission alarm bell has been tripped . Well , how ? ( STUTTERS ) How ? Well , they go into a gaming room and it has high rollers ... Anybody ? Okay , fine . And , they 're really good . And they win just enough money to stay under the radar . Right ? And then they ... Fine . ( CLAUDIA EXCLAIMS ) Then they move on , they don 't get caught . Okay , so they 're taking a little back from the house . OMG what 's the BFD ? ARTIE : What ? ( PETE AND CLAUDIA LAUGHING ) Yeah , iniquitous hands with the means to exploit fate . ( WHISPERS ) " Iniquitous " means " bad . " Thanks , Roget . So , where are they now ? Three hours ago , they checked into room 1510 at the Maximus Hotel in Las Vegas . So , I 've also prepared rundowns , this is yours , of possible artifacts that are still in the wild that might be responsible . And there 's also plane tickets and reservations for the Maximus and all that stuff . ( EXCLAIMING ) Vegas , baby . Kicking it ! Where 's the money ? Hmm ? Well , we need to roll high . Yeah , there 's $ 10,000 in Pete 's envelope . Oh , snap . ( EXCLAIMING ) Oh , yeah . ( PETE LAUGHING ) Doubt it . Do you ... Are you sure this is enough ? Get out . Get out . Pack . Boys . ARTIE : Hey , hey , do me a favor . Yes , yes , yes , my liege , I shall bring you receipts . ARTIE : Yeah , that , too . But also one more thing . Is she mad at me ? No . Okay . Yes . Maybe . A little . But , look , a trip to Vegas will un-bunch the pants , and it should be fun . No , no , no , no . Please , don 't have fun . Yeah , or crap out . ( LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY ) That 's so funny . Later . So , what am I doing ? What do you mean , " What are you doing ? " Well , Leena told me Mrs. F is keeping you off the MacPherson trail . So , I mean , it doesn 't mean I can 't look for him , probably ... I 'm only going to say this once , are you listening ? Yeah . Back off ! The man will kill you , kill you . Understood ? Yeah . Yes , sir . ( SIGHING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) PETE : Why , hello . How are you ? Hi . All right . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Va-va-voom ! Your tie 's crooked . Well , you just knocked everything crooked . How are my teeth ? Your teeth are fine . ( SNIFFS ) Perfume . That 's a first . Mmm-hmm . So , I 've been going over the possibles . I 've been sniffing 10 grand . Nothing in Artie 's hit list suggests a multi-part object , which means we 're looking for one thing , and it should be in their possession . Why ? Carson 's rule of linear transfer . ( SPEAKING IN GERMAN ) It means they have to have it on them . Forced outcomes require tangency . ( MUMBLING ) Well , someone 's been paying attention . Mmm-hmm . Some of us longer than others . Okay , well , let 's assume that it is a single artifact shared by two suspects . Why don 't we each take one and we 'll compare notes ? Okay . I 'll take Lady Luck . You take her date . And I got these . I , uh ... What is it ? ( PETE MUMBLING ) I cleaned them with alcohol , all right ? So ... And a little bit of spit . Kidding . ( LAUGHS ) Testing . Sorry . Ow ! Okay . Oh , you have the Tesla , right ? Yes . I 'll trade you for the Farnsworth . But you ... You have the gun . I know , but it 's the boring one . Well , you lost the toss . I know . Let 's just go find this artifact and see if we can 't change somebody 's luck . ( PETE SIGHING ) Okay , that thing is so freaky . What , this ? Yeah . No , the thing behind you . Yeah , that . ( CHUCKLES ) Well , trapped desires refracted by light , sounds , sex , mind-altering drugs , into a disco ball . Disco ball . A disco ball . I know . I know . Dude , how ? Well , unknown , unknown , but mirrors are usually just gonna reflect light , but this thing projects yearnings and cravings . You know what this thing does ? It imparts the grim , stampeding inhumanity against anything decent . ( CHUCKLES ) You asked . ( SCOFFS ) Don 't worry . Not in here . In here , it 's just a round , shiny object , but out there ... It 's the ' 80s ? The ' 70s . By the way , I 'm sorry I came down on you a little hard at Leena 's . You know , whatever . It 's just because I owe you , you know , for helping me and saving Joshua . I mean , the guy hurt you , you know . It pisses me off . Yeah , yeah . If finding MacPherson helps you ... Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay . Just ... Just help me lift this thing . We 'll do it on three . All right . Well , can Mrs. Frederic find him ? I don 't know . On three . One , two , three . Well , the guy used to work here though , right ? Yeah . And what , the place drove him nuts ? Something lured him to the dark side ? Yeah . No . He is the dark side , and things are lured to him , people especially , which is why you 're never going to mention his name ever again . Just to you ? To anyone . Promise me . Yes . Is that Myka ? Whatever it is , it 's not good . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Red five . You 're pushing our luck . Yeah , and it 's pushing right back . Take a break . I 'm okay . JILLIAN : We 've got enough , okay ? Nobody 's legs are getting broken . Everybody 's paid off . Well , college for five kids won 't be cheap . We 're having three . And it won 't matter if you 're not around for the honeymoon . Oh , I 'll be around . It 's going to be the best years of our lives . ( CHUCKLES ) Just five more spins . Three . PETE : Okay , we found them . ( SIGHING ) You see anything ? MYKA : Besides two scoundrels in love ? No , but they might have something off-site . All right , I 'm going to go toss their room . Call me if you see them chewing on a rabbit 's foot or adjusting a magic girdle . DEALER : Red 23 . ARTIE : Careful ! CLAUDIA : Stop yelling ! Start listening . I 'm so running over your toes . All right , just get it straight . Not like that ! Okay ! Could you close the door behind you ? Got it . You know what ? Pull all the Dodgson files , would you ? And pull anything that 's got a listed cross-reference like Alice Liddell , Lewis Carroll . What are you still standing here for ? CLAUDIA : I 'm not your girl Friday . What kept you ? Three pumpkin pies and a broken oven thermostat that you keep promising to fix . Um ... Yeah . What 's this ? Well , this is why I called you . Artie , what happened ? Yeah , optical divagation , I think . Wait , what ? Kind of like a retinal flare after a photo flash . My best guess is the blast from the disco ball , it kind of fritzed this mirror 's primary reflective capacity . And then , it probably clipped part of Myka 's psyche , infused it in there . I don 't know . You know , it 's kind of like shadows on a wall after Hiroshima . It 's a pretty lively shadow . Yes , but is it ? Is it what ? Alive . ARTIE : Uh-huh . ( INAUDIBLE ) You want to ? ( STUTTERS ) Sure . ( SIGHING ) Uh , what 's that about ? I 'm going to pull her back if she falls in . Get your mind out ... Okay . Thanks . So ? Nothing . So , what is it , just a shadow play ? Well , the glass is like a barrier . If that 's alive , I can 't tell . Let 's just ask her . It . It . It might have something to tell us . I mean , why can 't we just talk to her ? Because we do not converse with reflected entities , okay ? Because ... Because two words , Bloody Mary . That 's just an urban legend , though , right ? Of course , it isn 't . Shadows have power , and you let this thing speak and there is no telling what could happen . Pete was playing ping-pong with one of those things . Weren 't you supposed to go pull files or something ? Thank you . Okay , oh , and pull anything from Studio 54 . CLAUDIA : Got it . 54 . Heard you . Can I make a suggestion ? ( SIGHING ) Sure . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) I haven 't lost a penny , Mom . ARTIE : Is Myka with you ? PETE : No , she 's downstairs on the Whitmans . I 'm getting ready to search their room . What 's up ? ( MUMBLING ) Nothing . How 's your radar ? ( CHUCKLING ) You mean am I having a vibe or something ? Yeah . Give it a second . Anything out of the ordinary ? Anything at all ? With Myka ? ARTIE : With anything . You know , now that you mention it , there is something . What ? The buffet is overpriced . ARTIE : Other than that . No . No vibe , no trouble . It 's all good . All right . Are you sure ? ( CHUCKLING ) Artie , is there something I should know ? No , no , no , no , no . Everything 's good , it 's just a status check . Don 't dawdle , stay in touch , goodbye . PETE : " Kirk , out . " He 's fine , so is Myka . Okay ? Okay . ( DOOR LOCK BEEPS ) ( WHISPERING ) Put it down on black 15 . Myka . Yes ? I got nothing . Yeah , nothing 's going on down here , either . They 're still winning and I 'll be damned if I know how . ... cons of the situation , I just don 't ... Yeah , I know . I have . I just think that that 's ... LEENA : What if , maybe , we put those two together ? ARTIE : I don 't think that 's going to work . What about what we tried in ... LEENA : What is that ? Oh , that 's just something I whipped up . Yeah . What do you mean ? Just now ? Yeah , that 's right . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . What ... What are you doing ? I 'm opening a line of communication . The CIA uses laser mikes to read vibrations off windows to hear what 's going on on the other side of the window , right ? Yeah . I want to hear what she has to say . ( EXCLAIMS ) Bloody Mary , shadows have power , I get it . But what if that 's not just a shadow , Artie ? Artie , that look on her face is somebody who 's trapped . Believe me , I know that look , and so do you . If things get hinky , you can pull the plug . What 've you got to lose , okay ? I do need to do this . ( EXCLAIMING ) ( STUTTERING ) Don 't ... I mean , just wait . I just ... Wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait . Let me think . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Myka . Myka , where are you ? Oh . Hey . So , Mr. Whitman doesn 't look good . No sign of any artifact ? Not even a glimmer . What 's up with his hand ? I don 't know . Look , if you want to get some rest , I 'll stay with them . Not if they split up . If they do , I 'll call you . No , no , let 's stay together . If they 've got something , it 's on them . I want to know what it is . ( MACHINE HUMMING ) ARTIE : I 've been burned by this before . They look real and they 'll say anything . Say something . Artie , when I get out of here , I 'm hugging her and I 'm kicking your ass . Yeah , well , that won 't be happening . Why ? Artie , it 's me . No , no , you 're just a reflection . The real Myka 's in Las Vegas on a mission with Pete . What ? No , no , I 'm not . Artie . You see , that 's exactly what I mean . You just don 't do it . Turn that thing off . Artie , if I 'm in Vegas with Pete then how can I be here ? No , just don 't turn it off ! ( MACHINE SWITCHING OFF ) ( INAUDIBLE ) Whatever that thing is , it 's never getting out of here . ( CHUCKLING ) Lewis Carroll 's Alice , you 're so sweet , so innocent , so not true . This woman was as mad as a hatter and Charles Dodgson , aka Lewis Carroll , was not writing books . He was chronicling this young woman 's descent into a sociopathic madness . All of his books , he didn 't write these books . These are Warehouse fabrications , brilliant fabrications , to hide the truth about that mirror . ( SIGHS ) Here 's a report from Warehouse field agents . Yeah ? The mirror crossed paths with Alice Liddell . I bet it crossed paths . When ? Well , right before the murders . That 's terrifying . Yeah , and there 's no mention of where the mirror came from . Okay , well , where do any of these things come from ? Okay , but , Artie , these agents , they trapped her inside of the mirror . Yeah . Somehow her energy , her essence ... Even they weren 't sure how it happened . Wouldn 't it have been nice , Leena , if these Warehouse field agents had bothered to figure it out before she killed one of them ? Lot of loose ends here , okay ? So , I 'm not ... Hey , that is why , Claudia , taking inventory is so important ! So , what are we saying ? What are we saying ? Are we saying that just Myka 's image got melded with the crazy essence of Alice ? Yeah , yeah , that 's exactly what I 'm saying . Looks like Myka isn 't Myka . And if we give voice to that thing , it will trick us somehow to try to get out , and that is not going to happen . We 've done enough . No , we promised each other we 'd stop at $ 5 million . I 'm a lying , convicted thief , Gary . I 'm breaking the promise . No . We 're so close . We 're just a few thousand away . It won 't make any difference . You need to see a doctor . ( SCOFFS ) We don 't have any insurance . Please . We 'll be paying out of pocket . And I won 't go unless we offset what that 'll cost with an hour 's worth of betting . Listen to yourself . You listen . My hand can rot off . I 'm not going to any doctor . We should take it now . Take what ? Whatever it is they 've got , you know , force them to hand it over . Well , we 're not even sure ... One more round of betting and then I 'm cashing us out . You 're the boss . I was just trying to keep her distracted . We 're clear . I want him . Sorry ? You follow the girl . I 'll stay here and I 'll call you if he comes out . Are you sure ? Yeah . I can handle him if there 's trouble . ( CLEARS THROAT ) All right . Okay . ( COUGHS ) I 'II ... I 'll call you if I catch anything . Do that . LEENA : Artie , I know you 're not as sure about this as you 're pretending . ARTIE : I 'm not pretending . You know when you hold a mirror up to a second mirror and you get that sort of reflected infinity thing ? Mmm-hmm . Well , what happens if that mirror is reflected in something like the Studio 54 disco ball ? Is it possible to get some kind of artifact interaction , something completely unexpected ? ( SIGHING ) I don 't know . What if the disco ball goes off and someone is standing in front of Alice 's mirror ? Well , I think we know what happened . Do we really ? Could reflections switch places ? Could people ? She pulls to the right . Pardon ? It 's something I noticed a couple minutes ago . When Myka 's mad at me , she pulls to the right . She 's mad at you now , has been for about a week . So , is she ? Pulling ? LEENA : To the right ? ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Red 23 ! Excuse me , miss . Hi , you dropped this . Keep it . Maybe you 'll get lucky . That 's what I 'm hoping . ( BALL ROLLING ) ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) DEALER : Red 21 ! Holy bananas ! Okay . Oh . Uh ... Okay . You are really mad at me . I feel sorry for you , actually . And why is that ? Because of all the things right in front of your face that you simply refuse to see . Like what ? Like me . ARTIE : Oh , well ... Yeah , well , I need to ask you a question that only the real Myka would know the answer to . ( EXCLAIMING ) You know what ? You 're wasting time , Artie , ' cause Pete 's in danger . Yeah , well , so are you , right ? In danger , if you 're really who you say you are . Okay . Okay , fine . Here 's what you and I both know , but we never talk about it . All right ? Mmm-hmm . That I don 't trust you . That I need you to tell me the truth and not treat me like some chess piece that you move around on a board that only you can see . That I am valuable . That I matter . And that I deserve to know everything I can about this world that you send me into every day so at least I have a fighting chance . ( LAUGHS ) You know , in spite of everything ... In spite of everything , I like you . I think you 're great . I want you to think the same of me . ( SIGHING ) ( ARTIE INHALING DEEPLY ) I screwed up . ( GRUNTING ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) MYKA : Honey , my key 's not working . Hi . Where 's him ? Him 's not here . What room you looking for ? My room . ( HICCUPS ) Who are you ? You 're cute . And you 're faking it . Never con a con artist . ( GRUNTS ) You had your chance to walk away . You won 't get another . ( VIBRATING ) Hey . Hey . Uh ... Pete with you ? No . Listen , I 'm a bit busy . Can I call you back ? Yeah . No , sure . Everything okay ? ( CHUCKLES ) It will be as soon as I can get back to work . Okay . Oh , I 've got some bad news . Leena tells me that your ferret escaped and she 's been trying to call for it . She doesn 't know its name , I don 't even know if you finally did name that thing . Did you ? No . No , actually I never did . Just put some food out and it 'll come back . I got to go . Now , where were we ? ( LEENA CHUCKLES ) Myka did name the ferret . She 's just not telling Pete the name . Why not ? Because she named it Pete . Yeah , it 's cute , but it 's so annoying . ( LAUGHING ) No , that 's good . I like that . You think that 's funny ? Huh ? Because if she thinks we know , she 'll kill him . Jillian , hi . The name 's Pete . Look , you 're in trouble and I 'm here to help . That chip that you have , the one that 's changed your luck ... Hey ! Let go or I 'll scream . Jillian , it 's hurting you , okay ? That is a contact wound . Wishing objects do that . This one seems to be a bit addictive and we both know that that 's bad , right ? So , you keep the money , but you give me the chip . No . Gary 's sick , too , isn 't he ? You got to stop while you 're ahead , Jillian . Trust me . Don 't make me use this . The Jubilee Grand , right ? The fire ? What are you going to do with it ? I am going to put this on a shelf and ignore it forever . Damn it ! ( WAITRESS EXCLAIMS ) Wow . I know . Now watch . Watch what ? JILLIAN : That chip allows you to see the future . Damn it ! ( WAITRESS EXCLAIMS ) Are you all right ? Yes , thank you . Yeah , I can see the attraction . You have to tell him what 's going on , Artie . Well , he may have figured it out already . Seriously ? I mean , it 's Pete we 're talking about here . I can 't ... I can 't get a hold of him . I mean , his cell keeps going to voice mail . Alice has obviously got the Farnsworth , so ... Well , dude , he 's in a big hotel . There was this man at the bar one night bragging about how he miraculously survived the inferno . He said that this chip saved his life . And you stole it . That 's what we do . WOMAN ON PA : Pete Lattimer , white courtesy phone . Phone call for Pete Lattimer . Jillian , take the money and run , don 't walk , find a beach , never look back . I am going to go get your husband . Hold on . You 're not arresting us ? You 're letting us go ? What happens in Vegas , okay ? Just get out of here . ( SIGHING ) It looks like you were telling the truth . Don 't hurt Jillian . Oh , Gary , do you know what ? Hurting is half the fun . You want to know what 's more fun ? The other half . Who are you ? You 've had your wishes , Gary . Now it 's my turn . And now I 'll know when they 're coming for me . And if I can see them , I can kill them . ( ELECTRICITY SURGING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GARY THUDDING ) ( CHUCKLES ) I bet you didn 't see that coming . PETE : Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm fine . I had to use the Tesla . He 's dead . You killed him . Pete , what 's going on ? Change of plans . Pete ... What , do you think I 'm an idiot ? Don 't answer that . Just stop , okay ? Just put down the gun and let 's think this through . Okay . Guess what ? I 'm still taking the artifact . I can 't let you do that , Pete . Die trying to stop me , Alice . ( CHUCKLES ) ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , clever boy . What tipped you ? ( PETE CHUCKLING ) The real Myka would never kiss me . Never . Not if her life depended on it . Which is ... A shame . You 're a good kisser . So , Artie hasn 't figured this out yet ? No , not yet , but when he does , he 'll set the real Myka free and you will , poof , disappear . ( CHUCKLES ) It doesn 't work that way , Pete . Meaning what ? Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in . Really ? And I am done with that . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh . Well , I beg to freaking differ . Freak . I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance . Turn around . This is on you . You 're the one who set me free . Yeah ? Well , I 'm fixing that right now . Turn around . Oh , my ... ( BOTH GRUNTING ) I 'm never going back into that mirror . Do you hear me ? ( GROANS ) Never . ( ELECTRICITY SURGING ) And this , this is my ace . That 's it . Cash me out . ( BEEPING ) " Curiouser and curiouser . " ( EXCLAIMING ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( GRUNTS ) Artie , now ! ( DISCO MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SCREAMING ) ARTIE : Hey , Pete , help me . Artie , where is Myka ? Thank you . Yeah , you 're welcome . All right . Okay . Okay . Here , let 's get this . So , what now ? Now ... Now we move Alice to the dark vault . What 's the dark vault ? It 's better than the " Oy , Gevalt . " ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Yeah . No , the dark vault ... You 've never seen the dark vault ? Yeah . I 'm going to hazard a guess here , you 're never going to want to see the dark vault after we move that to the ... Okay , you get the ... No , you know what ? Let 's do this tomorrow , okay ? ( STAMMERING ) But , you know , we better secure it . You know , let 's move that trunk . When I say " let 's , " I mean you . Little known , but apropos fact , by the way , Steven Rubell , who was one of the co-founders of Studio 54 , he considered calling his club Wonderland . Wow . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) MYKA : Oh , my God ! ( EXCLAIMING ) ARTIE : Other side . PETE : Hey , lady ! ( PETE LAUGHS ) ARTIE : Okay . Yeah . Hey , let 's go . Hey , hey , my 10 grand . Right , about that . Well , Artie , you know , uh , last-minute Apache helicopter rides to the middle of nowhere , South Dakota , don 't come cheap . ARTIE : Okay , I know a guy with a Chinook . Would 've cost you about half if you would have called me . PETE : Well , I had to beat Alice here , didn 't I ? Hey , hey ! What 's going on ? Did it work ? Did it work ? ARTIE : Look who 's here . Oh , my God ! She 's back . ARTIE : ( WHOOPING ) Making breakfast , come on . Come on . PETE : So , Myka , you said I was a good kisser . MYKA : What ?

 NARRATOR : Previously on Bionic Woman ... If I had the pleasure of taking this monster down , I would be alone on that rooftop . You 've done this before , haven 't you ? You wanna tell me why you knew that guy was arriving at the airport before Jonas even called me ? Just trust me . ANTONIO : They know you were here . They 're sending more agents as we speak . Antonio was communicating with the assassin . You 're gonna have to bring him in . No , actually , you 're going to have to bring him in . ( GASPS ) You want to tell me what the hell is going on ? I heard you with the assassin . I 'm not working with the assassin , but I do know her . She saved my life . Why the hell should I believe any of what you 're saying ? You 've got to believe me on this one . ( GUNSHOT ) Julianne , stop ! Take the shot , Antonio . Shut up , Sommers . ( GROANS ) ( HEART MONITOR FLATLINING ) NATHAN : He 's had such a rough exterior , you know ? And you think that he doesn 't care if you 're having a rough day or not , but he does . Or he did . JAE : To Antonio Pope . It was an honor to know him , to work with him . We 'll miss you , pal . Yep . I slept with him once . It was amazing . ( LAUGHING ) Come here for a second . So , are you doing okay ? Yeah . I 'm good . Because , you know , someone died . Someone who was a friend of yours , who you cared about . You know what ? I 'm getting used to it . Honky with the dreads is off the hook . How do you think I would look with those ? Honestly . I can tell when you 're rolling your eyes . JAIME : Can you tell when I don 't care ? Touch√© . Why aren 't you asking me who this guy is , and why we 're following him ? Why aren 't you peppering me with questions ? Fine . Who is he ? He 's a bad guy . Why is he a bad guy ? 'Cause he does bad things . This is starting to sound like phone sex . If this is what phone sex sounds like to you , you 're doing it wrong . You have no idea , do you ? What , about sex ? No . None . Zero . Now , I do know that women cry a lot , afterwards . Oh , God . ( GROANING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) Who the hell are you ? Shut up ! What the hell was that ? How about you just shut the hell up , we 'll get to Berkut , and you can ask your questions to somebody who cares ? ( GRUNTS ) She 's totally PMSing . ( VOICE MAIL BEEPING ) Hey , it 's me . Sorry we keep missing each other . Had another long day at work , and I just needed to hear a friendly voice . You know , I 'm starting to get really confused about what I 'm doing and why , and now I have to go upstairs and put on a big smile , and see my sister and pretend like everything 's okay , and ... Yeah . Anyway , you 're probably working , too . So I 'II ... Call me later . ( PLAYING TEENAGERS ) What is he doing here ? He 's doing dishes . Why ? Jaime , I don 't know . He 's your boss . Why don 't you go talk to him ? Hey , you wanna dry ? Beccs , could you give us a minute ? I don 't know what you think you 're doing , but this is my personal space . Here , your sister watches way too much TV . This is the home of a depressed person . I am working all hours , and you come here and criticize my housekeeping ? I came over here because I 'm concerned about you . You 've been through a lot , you need to take some time off . Is this because I kicked that guy 's ass ? No . It 's because Antonio was your friend and he died and you need time . Work is the only thing holding me together right now . If I stop and think about everything that has happened to me , I 'm gonna go crazy . I understand that . But it 's not a good strategy , Jaime . I 'm not asking you , I 'm telling you . You 're gonna take a vacation , and Berkut will pay for it . I don 't take handouts . Okay . Then you can make a delivery for me . I need to get a briefcase to a man in Montana . You give him the briefcase , you take a week off . Do you like to hike ? You 're sure that 's it ? It 's just a briefcase . Antonio used to say a briefcase is never just a briefcase . Yeah , well , Antonio 's dead . ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO ) Are you mad at me ? No . It seems like you 've got something on your mind . That 's the most you 've said for the past two days . What are we doing ? I mean , why is it okay for me to suddenly ditch school ? You 're not ditching school . I wrote you an excuse , so it 's fine . We 're just taking a little trip . That 's what we 're doing . I mean , you know , you mope around the house for a week , not taking care of yourself . And , I mean , clearly something is wrong . And now , all of a sudden , we 're on this trip . I mean , what do you think it 's gonna accomplish ? Do you think we 're going to have deep talks and bond ? Yeah . That 's exactly what we 're going to do . We 're going to talk and take spa treatments , grab some food , make memories . It 's going to be great . What 're you doing here , Nathan ? I want you to train me . Train you to what ? I want to learn how to fight . Aren 't you supposed to be at a Star Trek convention or something ? I 'm serious , Jae . What happened to your eye ? J.R. Who 's J.R. ? He 's my older brother . It 's just ... Sometimes he gets a little physical with me . Aren 't you a little old for your brother to be picking on you ? Yeah , I 'm also a little too old to be living with my parents . But I 'm working on it . So why does he hit you ? He 's just always been a little jealous of me . Why ? Hey , I just have to make a call . I thought you had to go to the bathroom . I do . I just need to make this call . For work ? Yeah . Look , it 's the last one I 'm going to make , okay ? After that , I 'll give you my cell . No more . Really ? Really . All right . ( KNOCKING ON CAR DOOR ) Sorry . Sorry . You 're Jonas ' girl . Just say it , so I can get out of here . I 'll give you the briefcase and go . There 's a lot of rumors going on around about you . Will you just say it ? Do you really have x-ray vision ? Yeah . Yeah , I do . Just say it . " In 1972 , a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court " for a crime they didn 't commit . " These men promptly escaped " from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground . " Today , still wanted by the government , they survive as soldiers of fortune . " If you have a problem , if no one else can help " and if you can find them , maybe you can hire The A-Team . " ( IMITATING MACHINE GUN ) You want me to do the theme song for you ? Have a nice life . ( PHONE RINGING ) You 're registered in the Green Party ? What ? Are you actually gonna vote for Dennis Kucinich ? How do you know this ? Visual caller I.D. Anyone calls my line , I see their photo , date of birth , social security number , criminal record , you name it . Nathan set it up for me . Is that legal ? How 's the vacation going ? Your guy 's a nut job . Is it done ? Yep . Bye , Jonas . Thank you . You sure you don 't miss your phone ? Not even a little . Your thumbs must be going through withdrawal . You haven 't texted anyone in like , an hour . I don 't ... Leave me alone . So , what are we gonna do ? There 's a million things to do . There 's horseback riding , there 's a spa , there 's fricking ballroom dancing classes . There 's meditation with gems . That sounds different . How about we go up to the room , order some room service , turn on the TV , you know , eat and get really fat , so no one will love us . God , I love you . Come on , let 's go . ( MAN EXCLAIMING ON TV ) So good . Switch . ( LAUGHING ) Switch . Mmm-hmm . ( SNIFFS ) ( CHOKING ) WOMAN : How can I help you ? Our On-Demand isn 't working , and TV is really important to us . We 'll send up an engineer . What room ? 108 . You 're 108 ? Yeah . This guy has been calling for you for the past hour . He asked me to go to your room and knock on the door , but I told him it 's against hotel policy . He 's a very pushy man . I ... Uh ... Sorry . CLERK : If you break it , you have to buy it . Excuse me . ( PHONE RINGING ) WOMAN : Front desk . Please hold , sir . No , sir , I will not . Please hold . It 's him . Should I transfer it to one of the courtesy phones ? Yeah . Just ... ( PHONE RINGING ) Jaime , why did you turn off your cell phone ? 'Cause you told me I needed a vacation , so I turned my cell phone off . I told you to take a little time off . Not to go off the grid . I 'm not off the grid . It 's a four star hotel I 'm at ... Listen , I 've got a problem . My guy 's gone quiet . He never checked in . Jonas . He 's a little unstable . No kidding . So , can you look in on him for me ? Listen , I would never ask you to do this if it wasn 't an emergency . He 's staying in room 203 . He 's staying here ? Yeah , I know . I was surprised , too . He seemed like more of a seedy motel kind of guy . Can you do this for me or not ? Okay . I was booking us spa treatments . She kept me on hold for 10 minutes . Beccs , you know , I was thinking about what you said , and I know you 're not stupid . I know I 've been acting weird lately and everything , and ... What ? Okay , okay . Stop talking . Because , listen . Okay . I met this really ... Hey . Nick . This is my sister , Jaime . Jaime , this is Nick . Hey , Nick . Nice to meet you . Hey . Well , I 'm starving . You want to go get some breakfast ? Yeah . Great ! You two grab a table , and I 'll run upstairs and book the spa appointments . Okay . Sweet . Okay ? Hey , in case you 're looking for this , don 't even bother . I 'm insulted . Okay , isn 't he cute ? Super cute . And we hate all the same things ! I mean ... Hello ? Oh , my God . ( PHONE RINGING ) Yeah . JAIME : Jonas , he 's dead . He 's lying right in front of me and he 's dead . How ? Maybe it has something to do with the hypodermic needle sticking out of his arm . Damn it . Obviously , I 'm on the job now , Jonas . So , just fill me in . No , I 'm not going to do that to you . What was I delivering ? Who the hell is this guy ? It 's not your problem , Jaime . Oh , my God . He 's an assassin ? Were you going to have somebody killed ? What was in that briefcase ? Don 't worry about it . Don 't worry about it ? The guy is lying here dead . Someone is gonna come in and find him . Okay , listen . Put him in the bathtub . Get a bunch of ice and some air fresheners , and I 'll send someone down to deal with it as soon as I can . I can 't believe this is happening . What am I supposed to do with the briefcase ? Put it in your room . I 'll have someone deal with that , too . Jonas , I 'm here with my sister . She 's with you ? Nothing 's going to happen to Becca . All right ? I promise you . Morning . Hey , we were about to send a search party . Sorry , I was on the phone to the spa , and then I just passed out . I ... We have treatments at 5 : 00 . Okay . Cool . Sweet . Is it cool if we go with Nick and his dad on a gondola ride at 1 : 00 ? You want to go on a gondola ? Not really . No , not really . But his dad 's making him go , so I thought we 'd go for moral support . We 'd love to . Cool . Nick . Hi , Dad . I 've been looking all over for you . Well , I 'm right here . You 're not going to use these lovely ladies as an excuse to avoid that gondola ride , are you , sport ? No , Dad . They 're going to come , too . Great . The more , the merrier . I 'm Vincent Aldridge . I 'm Nick 's dad . Hi . Nice to meet you . Hi . Come on . It 's not that painful . Give us a smile . This is why I told you I didn 't want to work with Javier . I 've got a body on ice , a target in play , and nobody to squeeze . Well , then , you just make it right . Hi , I 'm Jaime . I 'll call you back , man . I 'm Matt . How 's it going ? Could I have your cell phone for a sec ? Yeah . Sure . Okay . My minutes are your minutes . I 'll be right back , Mike . Matt . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? Jonas . I ... I opened the briefcase . The target 's son is now flirting with my sister . And we 're all supposed to be going on a gondola ride at 1 : 00 . Who is he ? He 's a very bad guy , Jaime . And you 're way out of your league . Can you just fill me in on everything ? Okay , he 's a nuclear engineer , who 's about to sell technology to the North Koreans . He 's posing as an accountant . What kind of technology ? He 's developed a more efficient way to enrich plutonium . It 'll give them weapons-grade fissile material that 's 99 % pure . You 're looking at a man who is about to hand North Korea a nuclear bomb . Don 't they already have one ? This one would work . By the way , who the hell is Matthew Clarkson ? I have no idea . Whose phone is it that you 're calling me from ? It 's the valet guy . He looks like a dweeb . Hey . Thanks , Mark . Matt . Yeah . You 're not so much of a dweeb . Thanks . Okay , okay . Just , boom , twist , back . There you go . Okay , okay . All right , all right . I can take a little bit more if it 's ... Give him a little bit more . I can take a little ... All right . Let 's do this . All right . I can take a little more . Come on . ( GRUNTING ) JAE : Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Easy , easy . Oh , God ! I saw the weapons and I ... What are you doing ? I 've been looking all over for you . Jae , he 's teaching me how to fight . What happened to your eye ? My brother . He 's ... I actually don 't even want to know . So , listen . We 've locked in on the engineer in Montana , but I can 't find a button man . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to Montana . And you 're coming with me . Why , why , why am I coming with you ? Is he ready ? Yeah , he 's got a couple of moves . Yeah , well , it 's actually only one move . I think he 'll be all right . You 're my backup . If I miss the target , go center mass . Bang , bang . Then , put one in his head . What ? I 'm not , I 'm not , I 'm not the guy ... I 'm kidding . I 'm kidding . I need you there in case Vincent has some of his research , we need to figure it out . Go get some Kevlar . Some Kev ... So , Jaime , what line of work are you in ? BECCA : She sells timeshares . No kidding . I have a timeshare in St. Barts . Six weeks in the winter , three bedrooms , right on the beach , pool . It 's fantastic . Unfortunately , I can 't use it this year , and I 'd like to sell it . But since they introduced that new tax clause ... I 'm sorry to intervene , Mr. Aldridge , but we kind of have a no-work rule in effect right now . I 'm sorry . I completely understand . You gotta play , too , right ? Yeah . Sometimes , you mistake your job for your life . Which isn 't such a bad thing , if you love what you do . Do you love what you do , Mr. Aldridge ? Are you kidding me ? I wake up every morning with a giant smile plastered on my face because I love what I do so much . Jaime , please , call me Vincent . Who are those guys , Vincent ? Well , believe it or not , there are some people out there who don 't love what I do . Who would have thought accounting could be so controversial ? VINCENT : Yeah . What time is it ? Oh , boy . You know , I 've got to get you back to the room , sport . I promised your mom you 'd call . And I believe you two ladies have some spa appointments . OPERATOR : Watch your step , ladies and gentlemen . Well , maybe we 'll see you guys for dinner ? Yeah . Sure . Come on , Nick . Let 's go . Come on in . What was that about accounting ? What ? Nick 's dad . He never said he was an accountant . It was a real conversation stopper . Okay . I 'm going to go shower and warm up before we go spa . Cool . Yeah , Jaime ? Jonas , I think I messed up . I think I got made . Is that what you say ? This guy , Vincent , I think he made me . Okay , that 's a problem . Yeah . I know it is . What do we do , now ? You 're going to have to take him out . Take him out where ? Jaime , listen to me . He knows who you are . He 's not gonna wait long . You have to kill him before he kills you . Okay , I 'm all robed up . Are you ready for the most relaxing three hours of our lives ? Totally . Let 's go . Let 's go . Rejuvenating facial . Yeah , your ... Really ? ... skin is too young for anything else . Right this way , Miss Sommers . So I 'll see you in three hours . We probably won 't even recognize ourselves , we 'll be so pretty . I have to go somewhere . If you can make sure my sister stays in that room for the next three hours , I 'll make it worth your while . Okay . Thanks . I don 't think I can do this . JAE : Trust me . I understand . Do you have any advice ? I do , but you 're not going to like it . Don 't think of him as a person . That 's gonna be hard for me . I just spent two hours on a gondola with him and his son . You 've got to think about what could happen if you don 't do it , Jaime . It does get easier . That 's what scares me . Thanks , Jae . JAIME : Hi . Yes ? I need to talk to Vincent . I 'm sorry . He 's not here . I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . Well , if I could just take a look . If I could ... Okay . We can do this the easy way or the hard way . You 're coming with me . WOMAN : Excuse me . Watch it . It 's on the left . Did you do it ? JAIME : No , I couldn 't do it . I was nowhere near being able to do it . You know , in an hour and 45 minutes , Becca is going to walk through that door . So , can you start by telling me what I 'm supposed to do now ? All right . I need you to calm down and put him on the phone . He wants to talk to you . Vincent ? Jonas Bledsoe , here . It 's nice to meet you over the phone . You with me ? Yes . I 'm here . The way I see it , you 've got two options . Number one , I kill you . The other one is you talk . And by talk , I mean , you tell me everything I need to know to keep this technology out of North Korea . Which would you prefer ? It doesn 't matter to me . I just need to know whether or not to wear gloves . I understand your son is with you . I 'll talk . But you 've got to get me out of here , or my own people will kill me first . And my son comes with me . Done . Dad , where are we going ? Little change of plans , sport . Matt , do you want to get my car , please ? I already called for Mr. Aldridge 's car . Fine . I 'll drive . JAIME : Thanks . Thank you . What 's going on , Dad ? You 're going to have to tell him sooner or later . I can raise my son without your help . Thank you . It 's nothing you need to worry about , Nick . Does it have something to do with your job ? ( TIMER BEEPING ) Do you hear that ? VINCENT : What ? Hear what ? Get out of the car . Why ? Get out ! Nick , get out . Dad , it won 't open . Open the door . I can 't open it ! Open the door ! Dad , it 's stuck , I can 't get out ! It 's stuck ! Come on ! Come on ! It 's all in the wrist . Jonas ? Somebody tried to blow up Vincent 's car with him in it . JONAS : Is he okay ? Yeah . Where are you ? Five miles south of the hotel . How are you fixed for transportation ? I stole a car . That 's my girl . Look , we 're heading west on the road . I think we 're being followed . Well , slow down and see if he passes . We should , we should get away more often together . Road trips ... Shut up . ... like this . He passed . A good tail 's always from the front . You hungry , sport ? Who are you ? And how the hell did you rip that door off my car ? Maybe you should be happy I did and not ask questions . You saved my son 's life . Thank you for that . He 's a sweet kid . He takes after his mom . I think I 've lost him . Maybe he deserves to know the truth about his dad . Maybe your sister deserves to know the truth about you . It 's a different situation . ( CELL PHONE BUZZING ) Hello ? Did you get the plate on that truck ? JAIME : XUV 05 . Well , it 's here , and so am I. Get out of there and meet me up front . We need to move now . ( GRUNTS ) See that ? JONAS : Vincent , let 's get you out of here right now . What about my son ? If we talk to his mother , we can put him in protective custody . You can speak to them after you make your statement . MATT : Jaime ! Jaime ! Jaime ! It 's Matt ! From the hotel ! Who 's that guy ? The valet guy . The one whose phone I used to call you . ( GUN FIRING ) The guy whose phone you used looked nothing like this . Clean this up for me . Take it back to the hotel . It 's going to be all right . The Berkut guys are on their way . Now , Nathan . I 'm worried that if I keep lying to her , I 'm going to lose her . So don 't lie to her . I don 't want her to think I 'm a freak . Listen , I never said you couldn 't tell her . You 've got to do what 's right for your family , Jaime . I found that out too late . The question you have to ask yourself , is she ready to hear it ? Anything has to be better than this . Maybe , maybe not . See , here 's the thing . Every person who knows is a potential source of information for people who might want to scrap you for parts or technology . Teenagers aren 't exactly known for their discretion . And if ... If you 're at greater risk , then so is Becca . It 's complicated . Yeah . I think either way , she 's lucky . Because she 's got you for a big sister . BECCA : Thanks . Hey . How was yours ? It was great . You look great . Yeah ! Look , I wouldn 't tip your girl too much . ( GASPS ) I 'm sorry . You don 't look any better . That was , like , three hours for nothing . Thanks . Come on . Nick never said goodbye . No ? No . No , that 's okay . I wasn 't that into him , anyway . This trip had learning . Hey . Yes , it 's more fun to be with a guy who gives you the time of day . Good for you . You know , I 'm glad we came . I had fun with you . Maybe we could do this again sometime . What ? What ? You 're freaking me out . Is there something on your mind ? There 's something I should tell you . What ? There was this guy who I work with , who died . I didn 't even really know him that well , but what I realize is , it 's really affected me . Was he a guy you liked or something ? No , it wasn 't like that . Wow . I 'm really sorry . Why didn 't you tell me about this ? I didn 't want you to worry about me . Well , that was really stupid . I know . Jaime , you can talk to me about this stuff , okay ? I 'm a lot stronger than you think I am . Okay . Now , is there anything else you want to tell me ? No . Nothing at all .

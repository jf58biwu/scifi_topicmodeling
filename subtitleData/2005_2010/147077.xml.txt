 We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . PREVIOUSLY ON THE 4400 ... I 'm blacking out . If you 're losing chunks of time , you should talk to your dad about it . What 's he going to do ? Turn me over to NTAC medical ? Let me see if I 've got this straight . You two met , fell in love , and spent eight years together in some kind of alternative reality ? Liv , you were pretty far gone last night . When I O.D. , it 's not going to be any big loss , right ? Maybe I can save you . Whatever it is , there 's a way out of it . That 's easy to say . You don 't know what " it " is . You told me everything that happened that night , right ? Yeah . If you need some time to clear your head and get away from everything so you can figure stuff out , I can make that happen . Dad , I had to leave . I 'm sorry . Look , I 'm not interested in excuses . I don 't care how you do it , who you have to lean on , you just get him out of lock-up and over to L.A.X. I want him on the next plane out . Skouris , where 's Baldwin ? He 's not in yet . Why ? What 's going on ? L.A.P.D. is holding some piece of street garbage who wants to see daylight again . Says he can make the dealer who sold the Collier murder weapon . Who 's handling the L.A. interview ? Nobody . I 'm having him shipped up here for questioning . This one feels good . My partner 's going to like hearing that . You can fill me in when I get to the office . Look , I know we 're not ready to pop any champagne yet , but this witness has intel we kept out of the media , specific details about the Collier murder weapon . Sounds like we finally caught a break . Look , Diana , I really have to go . Are you okay ? You sound a little distracted . It 's personal business . Not your worry . Well , any idea what time you 'll be in ? I can 't really say just yet . Look , I 'll get in touch with you as soon as I can , okay ? Okay , no problem . Bye . How long has this Been going on ? Calm down . No . I asked you a question . How long ? Look , Kyle told me , like , a month ago . Look , you remember that night ? Wha ... What night ? The night . That he almost got arrested for smashing that store window . You mean when he got drunk ? He never said he was drunk . You said he was drunk . Kyle said he blacked out . It happened a bunch of times after that . One minute , he 'd be one place , the next thing he knew , he was someplace else . He never mentioned it to me . He never said anything . Well , he tried once , but you wouldn 't listen . Look , you could have come to me , Danny , told me what was going on . He 's your cousin , your friend . Which is why I promised him not to . The last thing Kyle wanted was to be thrown back into quarantine . Danny , Kyle never came home last night . If you know where he is , please , tell me . He went to stay with Shawn over at the 4400 Center . Great . Uncle Tommy ... There 's something else you ought to know . Kyle thinks he did something during one of his blackouts . He wouldn 't tell us what it was , but he really seemed freaked out about it . This is the committee 's latest recommendation . 37-year-old pipe fitter from Detroit . He was diagnosed with Hodgkin 's disease four months ago . When do we fly him in ? Two days from now . Shawn . Where is he ? Who ? Kyle ? He 's not here . Don 't play games with me , Shawn . Can you excuse us , Lucy ? Thank you . Danny said Kyle came here . Yeah , well , Danny needs to check his text messages , because Kyle never showed . You 're not listening to me , Shawn . I want my son . You 're not hearing me . He 's not here . Where do you think I have him stashed , in the basement ? I wouldn 't put it past you . Oh , my G ... Uncle Tommy ! Just because Kyle is having a rough time does not make it my fault ! Been known to happen , Shawn . He 's not here ! He 's not here . Kyle ? Thomas . I picked this up in a village outside Barcelona , and they said it was very special . What 's wrong ? Kyle never told me any of this . At least I 'm not the only one out of the loop . I thought the doctors said he was fine when he left quarantine . They did ... but he spent three years with a separate consciousness living inside of him . I don 't think the doctors knew what to do with that . Have you called the police ? I can 't get them involved , not until I know what Kyle did . What about Linda ? Well , she says she hasn 't heard from him . Promises to call if she does . I 'm sorry about all of this . I 'm just glad I 'm back . Where are you going ? Well , I 'm not going to find him sitting here . I 'll come with you . No . Look ... I 'd rather you stay here by the phone . This way , if he calls ... You 'll be here . Okay . I 'll stay in touch . And this guy is some big-deal media consultant ? Oh , he 's more than that . Keith Petrick has prepped prime ministers , members of Parliament . I 'd say an interview with sky news merits a few hours ' homework . So he 's going to tell me what ? Just new and different ways to say " we 're not a cult " ? No , he 's going to teach you to stay on message . The British press loves to play " gotcha " . Keith . Matthew Ross . Thank you for coming . This is Shawn Farrell . Hi . Hi . Nice to meet you . Shawn . Just one minute . Sorry . Uncle Tommy came to see me . Yeah . That 's what I figured . He came here , too . What 'd you tell him ? Well , the truth . Kyle ditched us . He never showed . Listen , you know , he might still show up . You know ? Yeah . I 'd give you the big tour , but ... Yeah . No . Things are crazy . I get it . Wait , just wait , just wait . Liv . Liv . Hey . This is Danny , my brother . - Hi . - This is Liv . She 's one of our first keys . Actually , I 'm second key now . Really ? I 'm impressed . Star pupil . Hey , do you think you could give him a tour ? You know , Shawn , you don 't have to ... I want you to see the place . Just hold on . Is that cool ? Sure . Yeah . It 's cool . You two kids have fun . I 've got to ... I have to go back to work , so ... That 's my brother , off to heal the world . Somebody has to . You ready ? Yeah . I 'm all yours . Come on . I know who sold the rifle that killed Collier . That 's a start . Does we have a name ? Victor Rios . R-I-O-S . He lives at 43207 Sumac Drive . S-U-M-A-C I 've got it . Thank you . I 'm at Victor 's place last month . He gets all cranked up and starts waving this cannon around like he 's the second coming of Tony Montana . He wants to swap it for some of my product . I told him I wasn 't interested . Can you describe the weapon , Mr. Kovec ? I watched him put that sucker together . .50 caliber . Never saw bullets so big . And it had this humongous scope on it , like a huge neon sign saying " can 't miss " . What makes you so sure this was the weapon that killed Collier ? Because ... next time I saw Rios , he was bragging on how much he scored for that piece . This was , like ... two days before Collier got taken out . I figure that 's not a coincidence . What do you think ? I ask you to give him a quick tour , and two hours later ... She 's a good guide . Really sells this place . Danny was expecting shaved heads and robes . Yeah . I didn 't see a single tambourine . Are you disappointed ? Ah , you don 't hear me complaining . So , hey , listen , big boss man , you let your workers off the farm at night ? So I invited Liv to a party , but she 's too shy to ask if it 's okay . Think of her like a missionary ... A lot of potential recruits out there at the Northmount Campus . Could be cool . I haven 't left the Center in a while . I don 't think it 's a good idea . I 'm sorry , man . You 're going to have to find yourself a different date . Who are you , her warden ? Danny . Listen , you guys can hang out here as much as you want , no problem . But a Kegger , that 's another story . The wise and powerful Shawn has spoken . I hear and obey , your majesty . I 'm serious . Since when did Shawn have such a problem with Keggers ? Since he developed a messiah complex . So what time 's this party ? All right . I woke up in the middle of the night and there was Kyle , out here , crouching in the hallway . With no idea how he got there . That 's right . And I sent him away . You were , uh ... You were scared . It 's understandable . Not as scared as he was . I told him he needed to get help , that he should talk to you about these blackouts . I wish he had . We 'd have worked it out . Well , he wanted to . Then what stopped him ? Look , Mr. Baldwin , your relationship with your son is none of my business . Agreed , but if you have something to say , say it . I 'm sure Kyle loves you ... but I don 't think he really trusts you . What ? He told you that ? Pretty much . Eggs , butter , walnuts , cocoa powder . Who said making brownies was difficult ? Don 't forget to preheat the oven at 350 degrees . Uh-oh . Now things are getting really complicated . Relax . I 'm just kidding . Yeah ? Now ? No . That shouldn 't be a problem . I just need to get a sitter first . If there 's a problem , I 'll call you back . I 'm sorry , sweetie , I 've got to go to work . I 'll call Mrs. Skalka , see if she can come . No , wait . Don 't go . Well , I have to . We can make brownies another time . That man ... You don 't want to catch him . What man ? The man you 're chasing after . Someone 's going to get hurt . Who ? Is it someone I work with ? I don 't know . Just don 't go . Are you worried about me ? Don 't go . I think he get my car and head for the border ? Or ask to be assigned to another case . Hmm . Hand the risk off to another agent ? It 's not an option . Have you told Tom ? No , not yet . He 's been off the case for a while . Might be better for his health if he stays that way . She said someone was going to get hurt , but she didn 't say who . I don 't know . Maia 's visions aren 't usually so vague . This time , she 's had a vision involving her mother . Maybe she doesn 't want to see it too clearly . You 're not making me feel any better . Okay . How about this ? Hmm ? Any better ? Sure . You recognize that man , Mrs. Rios ? He was a customer of your husband 's . Husband ? He got me my green card and more trouble than I need . Why don 't you ask Victor ? If you can find him . Yeah , well , that 's the problem , Mrs. Rios . Your husband has left the country . Now , we know he 's in Puerto Rico . You see ? You know more than me . He didn 't tell you he was leaving ? I haven 't seen him in two weeks . Look , I need to get back to work . A month ago , your husband sold this man a weapon . Your husband is implicated in a murder , Mrs. Rios . This is not a very good thing for you . Particularly if you value your green card . Why don 't you just take another look at the sketch ? I remember the beanie . Not a regular customer . He only stopped by once . He was the one who bought the big rifle . And the handgun . What handgun ? Uh , you know . What do you call it ? A 9 mm . Anything else ? He was young ... in his twenties . Very quiet . He only stayed a few minutes , then left in a taxi . How do you know that ? I called it for him . Oh , we 're going to need that number . We were in the middle of a bio-lab practical , Kyle stood up , said he 'd be right back , and that was it . Bye-bye . Didn 't see him again till the next day . About what time did he leave ? Had to be 7 : 00 , 8 : 00 , tops . He 's wrong , as usual . It was closer to 6 : 00 . Don 't you remember ? We broke up right after Kyle ditched . Yeah , look . Anybody remember the date ? End of last month , wasn 't it ? It was the 25th . You sure ? Yeah . I remember when I got back to the dorm , it was all over the news . Jordan Collier 's murder . Baldwin . You going to grace us with a visit tomorrow ? Yeah , I 'm hoping , but right now it 's looking doubtful . Doubtful doesn 't cut it . We 're closing in on this guy . Look , we 've got real leads , and I need you in here . What kind of leads ? You want to know ? You get your ass into work . Thomas , it could be anyone . Look closer . Tell me there isn 't a resemblance . This is insane . Why would Kyle want to shoot Jordan Collier ? If it happened during one of the blackouts , he wouldn 't need a reason . Not if the future wanted their number one prophet dead . So you think they were controlling him again ? Yeah , directing his actions , moving him around like a puppet . Anything 's possible . Well , in that case , he wasn 't responsible . The " body snatcher " defense ? Alana , I 'm not sure the jury 's going to buy it . What the hell do they want from Kyle ? They took four years of his life . Isn 't that enough ? They warned us about this , remember ? They said you 'd be facing a crisis . What , and that makes it all right ? They warned me ? I don 't remember them telling me they 'd turn my son into a murderer . There must be a reason . Don 't defend them , Alana . Just don 't ! They used me ... All of us ... Kyle , Shawn . I 'm fed up . I love him too . I know . I know you do , Alana . Just ... I 've got to find him before NTAC does . I 've got to find him . Stop it . Serious business . Your answers are going to determine how far you go in the Center . If that security guard comes by , we 'll both get kicked out . Is that far enough ? Okay ... Question number one . Did you have fun tonight ? Aren 't you glad we didn 't listen to Shawn ? That 's two questions . Shh . Oh ! You 're supposed to think about your answers , not say them out loud . Right . Rules are rules . Okay . What are we , done ? Question number two ... Are you ready for the night to be over ? If your answer to question number two is " no " , remove your goggles and take your medicine . Percocet . Where 'd you get these ? At the party . Your buddy had them in the medicine cabinet . So you stole them ? What 's going on in here ? Thanks so much , Mrs. Skalka . I couldn 't sleep . Was that because of me ? Well , I 'm home now , sweetie . No worries . You know this case that I 'm working on , can you tell me anything else about what you saw ? Anything at all ? Because if you 're keeping something from me ... I told you everything . Don 't you believe me ? Of course I do . Are you going to work tomorrow ? Well , honey , it 's my job . Can I go to sleep now ? Sure . Here . Linda . Have you heard from Kyle ? No . I would 've called you if I had . I was hoping you 'd heard something . Linda , you two talk all the time . Yeah , I don 't remember any law against it in the divorce settlement . Listen , Linda , if you have any idea where he is . What , you think I 'm holding something back ? You 're the one with all the secrets . Look , you 're his mother . It makes sense you 'd try to protect him . In any way I could . But I thought that 's why he was living with you , wasn 't it ? Protecting him was supposed to be your specialty . You want to blame me ? Fine . Go ahead , but I 've got to find Kyle now . What if he doesn 't want you to find him ? I think he may be in trouble . Serious trouble . Tom , what is it ? What did he do ? At least give me a hint . You don 't want to know . It 's like I said ... you 're the one with all the secrets . Hello ? Kyle , I just spoke to your father . You didn 't tell him where I was . You came to me because you didn 't want to go back to NTAC . That 's what you said . Mom , I can 't talk to you about this . I told you . Well , that 's not the whole story , is it ? Mom , please . Kyle , tell me what 's going on . Could you excuse me for a moment ? Sure . Thank you . Just don 't tell me " I told you so " . Okay , I won 't , but I did . Don 't go blaming Danny for any of this . It was all me , okay ? The night just got away from me . I had some beers , and I ... You shouldn 't be having beers , Liv . You shouldn 't be having anything . A month ago , you were an addict . We can quit the lecture . I 've already packed my bags . You know , you want to quit , I can 't stop you . But if you want to stay ... and you can promise me that nothing like this is ever going to happen again , then please , enjoy life as a first key . I 'm a second key . Not anymore . Ahem . Mr. Farrell ? Are you going to be much longer ? No . Come in . So I 've got a bunch of new songs I 've written . Maybe I can play them for you sometime . Yeah . We 'll see . It 's not like I know him better than you , but we do talk . And he told you where his secret hiding place was ? No , but you looked in all the obvious places , and Kyle likes his privacy . Maybe you do know him better than I do . No ... I didn 't want to believe it , I kept ... I kept hoping I was wrong about this . Thomas , this is not Kyle 's doing . You 've got to hold on to that . Okay ... I want a couple of you guys to go down there ... Wait , don 't turn around . Express line direct to Vancouver , Please board now on platform three . Chris Benson , please report to Lost and Found . Chris Benson , Lost and Found , please . Alana , take this , hide it in the house . What are you going to do ? Go back to work . All right , I want this area secured . Garrity , I want a warrant to have these lockers opened and searched , as soon as possible . Well ... Look who came out of retirement . Good timing , Baldwin . Your partner can bring you up to speed . That is , assuming you intend to stick around . I 'm here . Mm-hmm . Well , we do know that two days before the assassination , our man arrived at this station with a bag full of firearms . Well , he could 've gone anywhere from here . Yes , so we 're canvassing all the Metro routes , we 're talking to the baggage handlers , ticket agents , bus drivers ... That sounds right . Meantime , we just had a shoeshine guy I.D. the sketch . He claims he helped our man make change to buy a locker . Does he recall which locker ? He thinks it 's in that group there . But all the people who use these lockers in a month ... The odds are , like , 1 in , what , 10,000 we 'll turn up anything useful . Yeah , so why are we even bothering ? You never know . All we need is one print . Yeah . We can only hope . I guess . You okay ? Maia had another vision . Now , she says if we catch this guy , someone 's going to get hurt . Did she say who ? Welcome back . Is Tom here ? Uh , no , he isn 't . You must be Alana . I 'm Linda . I know . That my interview ? I don 't want to see it . I know I sucked . I wouldn 't go so far as " sucked " . But you could do with more eye contact , better enunciation . But they didn 't drag any unnecessary dirt out of you , and that 's something . I was all distracted . Liv was here right before , and we got into this thing , because you told that junkie not to go out with your brother . Ex-junkie . I 'm just trying to protect her , that 's all . I 'm sure that was part of it . What do you think , I 'm jealous of Danny ? You do realize that a relationship with this girl is out of the question . Matthew , advise me all you want about the Center ... but that 's where it stops . You don 't understand , Shawn . You are the Center . Everything about you , everything you do . You cannot afford to have an inappropriate relationship . Jordan Collier was all about inappropriate relationships . I mean , every girl in this place was fair game to him . All the more reason not to repeat his mistakes . So what girl is worthy of the great Shawn Farrell ? I will let you know when you meet her . On to more important things ... I wish I had time to wipe that locker clean . Kyle 's prints could be all over it . We 've got to find him , get him out of town . Out of the country . You didn 't get anything else out of Linda ? Something she wouldn 't tell me ? No , she 's as scared as we are . I felt guilty lying to her . The less people who know the truth , the better . Still , I know how hopeless she feels . Her son is missing . She needs answers , and all she has to go on is a three-line goodbye note . Did you tell her about the note ? No . She brought it up herself . I never mentioned it to her . Kyle ... Dad . No , Kyle , wait ! Wait ! Goddammit , stop it ! Let go of me ! Enough ! Enough , Kyle . Then I being up Havon that roofer . Watching Collier through the scope , the way the trigger felt when I pulled it , and how his body twisted before it hit the ground ... I mean , I remember all of it , but it just feels like somebody else 's memories . They are . You weren 't in control of your actions , Kyle . You did not kill Jordan Collier . I haven 't had another blackout since . You think it 's over ? Let 's hope so . How long do you think I 'll be put away for ? Kyle , I am not going to let them put you in prison for something you did not do . Do you hear me ? Yeah . I just only wish you would have told me about these blackouts when they first started . You tried . I didn 't listen . You know ... it 's not a new thing , dad . I ... I know I haven 't always been there for you , Kyle , but I thought we had a pretty good relationship . We do . It 's just , you know , growing up with a dad who works for the FBI , NTAC ... It can be pretty intense , you know ? You mean I can be pretty intense . You can be scary at times . If you don 't believe me , ask mom . I don 't have to . I believe you . I 'm sorry , dad . Me too . Hey , baby . Kyle . Hi . I packed a few things for you . Anything else you need , we 'll get in Brussels . What time is the flight ? Noon . All right , we 'd better check in at the airport . We 'll be safer there . Okay , I emailed my friend , and they 'll meet us when we land . They promised to take good care of Kyle . Say goodbye to mom for me , okay ? Sure . I promise to break the news to her gently . I 'll come and visit you as soon as I can , Kyle . That 'd be good . Okay . I love you . I love you . All right . Thanks , dad . Yeah . Alana ... Keep a close eye on him , okay ? I will , Thomas . I will . So far , we 've found two ounces of hash , some bootleg DVDs , and three DOP kits that belong to people who shower in the terminal bathrooms . I 'm hoping we find a picture of Collier with a big fat " x " marked through it , all covered in usable prints . Yeah . Is everything okay at home ? Because if you need to take care of business , now is a good time . I can hang with forensics in case something turns up . Thanks . I 'll , uh ... I 'll stick around here . Skouris . When did that happen ? No . We 'll be right there . That was Jarvis . She just got a call from Metro west . They arrested a suspect 40 minutes ago , claim he 's our guy . Roy Keith Marsden . 25 , unemployed , made threats against Collier after his uncle joined the 4400 Center . Oh , and get this ... He owned a .50-caliber JLHP-6 . Alana ? Forget about the flight . Bring Kyle home . They just arrested a suspect in the Collier killing . You know , if you 're here to give me grief about Liv , you can forget it . What happened was your screw-up , not mine . You know , you could 've pulled me aside , told me she had this drug problem . I would 've backed off . So if you 're expecting me to apologize and kiss your robe , you 're wasting your time . I didn 't come here for that . Look , I just don 't want this to become a big thing . Okay ? When we were kids , we used to fight like crazy . Yeah . All the time . Yeah , and then the next day , we 'd blow it off . Everything would go back to normal . Yeah . Simple as that . Nothing wrong with simple . Are you , uh , planning on standing there , or are you going to help me out here ? With the car ? I don 't wash cars anymore . I 've got people that do that for me . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Yeah , well , I don 't , so ... Grab a sponge . Oh , see , now ... I should 've known I was going to get wet . Yeah , attaboy . Get your hands dirty . It 's been a while , huh ? Oh ! Give me that ! Come on . Hey , sweetie . Hi . Look , I know you 've already had dinner , but what do you say we take another crack at those brownies ? Okay . Great . So how was your day ? Pretty good . Good . Aren 't you going to ask me about mine ? We caught that man , the one that we were looking for , and guess what . Nobody was hurt . So there 's nothing to worry about . It 's all over . Not yet . last revision on 08.09.2005

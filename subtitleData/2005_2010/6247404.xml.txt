 When the human race reaches the first stars The time will come And a new era is born and the eternal question will be asked What will this hold for what we call - humanity ? What 's more important Simon , your son or your research ? That 's not fair , Caroline . I 've worked for the past 2 years perfecting this technology . I can 't just quit ! Keep practicing those moves . I will be home for dinner . I 've heard that before . So have I. Oh Simon ... the capacitors are almost fully charged ! Arthur , your as bad as Simon ! It runs in the programming ! Love you ! Bye , Dad . All right , Arthur . Let 's see how stable this is . This is looking good , Simon . Confirm spatial differential . Come on , baby , come on ! Confirmed . Far side telemetry initiating . Connection established and secured . Searching star charts . Location confirmed . Virgo cluster , unknown planetary mass . Yes ! Finally . One more step , Arthur , and we will never have to worry about funding again ! Discharging in three , two , one . Simon you 've done it ! I had my doubts . Overcoming doubts will only strengthen you . Come on . Help me with my suit . Hover Platform engaged . Powering particle emitters . Powering particle emitters . All systems are go ! To enter the portal without proper back-up . It is a breach of your own security protocol I 've run the simulation program a dozen times . Everything is fine . I have to take the next step now ! I can 't afford to wait for more tests Platform data stream secure . Communications channel secure . Bio-Suit integrity ... one hundred percent . Body life signs normal . Simon , I won 't be able to reach you if you 're farther than 10 meters from the portal . Don 't worry , I won 't be long . Seismic sensors activated . Terrain ... stable . Analyzing atmospherics ... stand by Environment suitable for carbon based life forms . I 'm going to take a quick look around . This is amazing , Simon . We 're getting everything on this end . Alert , alert ! - Simon , I 'm getting something on the scanner . Something big ! Behind you . You must get to the portal , Simon ! Arthur get me out of here ! Oh , no ! Simon ! You must get to the portal , Simon ! Try and grab my arm ! Bio-suit life signs terminated . Tracking beacon , " Non-operational data-stream disrupted . Warning , Warning . Unknown error . Portal connection lost . No ! Simon ! Simon ! Emergency shutdown initiated . Simon ! I have a gift for the High Priestess ! I have trapped this creature in the forest . But it is unlike anything I have seen before . Go your way and speak of this to no one . Good shot Ragis just as I taught you . You are getting as good with that bow , as your little friend is at learning the ways of the high priestess . Can I keep him ? Yes , my young Ragis . But that means you will be responsible for our small guest . Shepway , where is it come from ? Jac You 've found your father 's wristband . He 'd want you to have it . Jac , he 's ... missing ! He 's missing , mom . That means he can be found . It 's been 7 years , honey That 's a long time . You have to start looking forward . I 've heard his voice calling out to me , trying to reach us Jack , you were dreaming The same dream for 7 years ? He 's out there , mom trying to get home . I know it Sometimes we want something so badly . We convince ourselves that it 's true . Your Father is gone Jack you have to accept it . Not until I find out for sure what happened to dad . You know what happened . All we know is that he was working on a classified project at a secret location . He told us he was coming home but he never showed up . I wanna know why . Jac , I understand . I miss him too . I just wanna find him . Jac . Scanning all binary nodes . All nodes are negative for DNA or sensory algorithms . Access to advance core function restrictive by the planetary collective . Any Violation of collective code 7.02.09.03.033.129 Subchapter C Beta 925 Another dead end ! Time grows short . Tor has almost finished building his army . And lead an attack against Tor before he gains the strength of his forces . Only Ragis can lead Raphicca away from Tor 's treachery and back into the light . Unless he learns the truth he will never raise arms against Tor . Then it is time he learns that truth . And what about Simon ? Good ! Good ! Good , Ragis , keep the movement flowing . Yes . That was great , Ragis ! You 're a natural warrior . My father told me the same thing . Jack is a very fortunate son to have a father like you ! I 've been perfecting this portal for 7 years now . I 've tried so many times , but haven 't been able to get the slip-stream to align . But you have talked to Jack . You ' seen him thru the portal opening . Yes , I just don 't know if he was able to hear or see me ! With these new modifications and Shepway 's help , I know I will be successful this time . Getting home is all I 've dreamt of since I 've arrived here . But I never realized how painful it was going to be to leave you Ragis . I always knew you would return to your family . But now that the day has come , I cannot envision my life without you . You 'll never be without me , Ragis . I may not be here physically , but our spirits will always be linked . Ragis . I 've done everything I can do , Shepway . I need your gifts to bring the Portal to life . One of my crystals has been lost ! Will your remaining crystals be strong enough to engage the Portal ? We shall see . Close your eyes . Breathe slowly deeply . You have spoken of your son each day that I have known you . Bring Jac into your present mind . Establish a spiritual connection with him . That will transcend physical distance . Jac ! Jac ! Dad ? Dad ? Yes . It 's me , Jac . I knew it , I knew you were alive , dad ! Are you and your mom okay ? Yeah , yeah ya we 're fine . Where are you ? Very far away . What 's wrong ? I can 't get through too much interference in the Portal slipstream . The what ? ! How can I find you ? ... Callisto ... find Hymo ... at D.R. Droids These are the private Chambers of the High Priestess of Raphicca . By what right do you enter ? I am the king . I go wherever it pleases me . What treachery have you been weaving with the human ? I owe you no explanation for such a baseless accusation . My king , I can assure you there has been no treachery here . Perhaps you are unaware of the true motivation behind Shepway 's actions . That is impossible . Shepway has been my loyal mentor since I was born . I trust her with my life . Then your trust has been misplaced . Did you develop this evil sorcery to aid the rebels ? Of course not ! The human wished to return home , that is all . King Tor , I implore you to cease Your crystal was recovered ... in a rebel hideout . How could you turn you back on your kingdom ... and on me ? Prince Ragis , there is something you must know ... Your father ... ahh ! Traitor ! No ! Shepway ! Seek your father 's truth . Murderer ! No more killing . Take them to the dungeon ! Come along , Ragis . Get your hands off me ! No ... Ragis ! So , Can you do two tons ? No problem . Then all we got left to talk about is price . Mom , I gotta talk to you . In a minute . - No , mom , it can 't wait . Dad 's alive , ok ! I just talked to him . I don 't have time for this right now . Well , Me neither . You wanna unload some veggies or not ? Definitely . Caroline Weir ? Yes . Agent Po , Galactic Intelligence . Were you aware that a restricted database was breached from your computer account ? You must be mistaken . To the contrary , Mrs. Weir . I 'm absolutely certain . I 'm telling you , no one has access to my account but me , and ... Listen lady when you wanna talk tomatoes , Don 't go , please . I 'll get rid of him in no time . I Don 't think so . Accessing restricted databases is a class three offense . Pending the completion of my investigation , I am suspending your trading license . How am I supposed to make a living ? I am also placing you under house arrest . Lucky for you , you have a nice house . If you leave your biosphere for any reason , you will be subject to immediate arrest and incarceration . That 's great , just great . The details are all here . Good day . I am an automated surveillance droid . Any attempt to tamper with my systems or prevent me from tracking your location is a violation of the law ... That ... , right there , that 's a violation of ! Oh , that does it . But mom ! Your little prank just cost us our trading license . And now , we are forbidden to leave the farm . Mom , mom listen I know how crazy this all sounds . But I 'm telling you the truth . There was an energy field - a ring of light . He was trying to come through . He was almost through , mom ! Jack do you know how many times in the past 7 years you told me you 've heard your Father 's voice ? I know , but this was different . He actually talked to me ... He said to go to Callisto . Yeah , D. R. Droids . He was sooo close , mom . - Let it go , Jac ! No ! No I am not letting him go ! Calisto ... Calisto ... Dad 's lab was there . I almost forgot , I found it in one of his packets . Let 's go . I remembered that you father did mention something and of course you wouldn 't have known that . I 'm sorry I never believe you . Oh ... It 's OK , MOM . It seems crazy to me too . You know Jac , there 's a lot of your father in you . You don 't think they 're looking for us , do you ? No way . What ? It looks like we 've got company . ... No way do we outrun him , not in this old beater . I guess you were too young to remember your mom 's favorite past time . - You mean giving me a hard time ? - Okay , second favorite . - No , what ? Rebuilding cruiser engines . Way to go , mom ! This is office 54 requesting back up . Suspects have violated house arrest and are subject to immediate apprehension . There 's three of them . Go go go . Bring your vessel to a stop immediately , you 're under arrest . Whoa , Mum , out off control ! I need you to help me find a place to hide . Wugh ! Mom , there , Head in there . Stay sharp , this lady 's good . Stay sharp , this lady 's good . Mom , sensors show something moving up ahead But I can 't tell what it is ? Mom , Scavengers I hope it is scavengers . - Looks like he blew a gasket . - I hope his insurance is paid up . I don 't see them on sensors . Suspects escaped . Return to base . I can 't believe you just pulled that off . Transport 9075 will be departing from launch bay 5 . All passengers and cargo ... Still no sign of them . D.R. Droids hello there ! Well Well , hello there ! C 'mon in ! I 've got the droid to fit your needs . The Keyton 972 ? Strong and efficient . Lifts 200 tons with one arm . Doesn 't break a sweat . Even in 7200 degrees ! But we 're ... Ah , how about Hawkings III ? Cracks into " The Universe in a Nutshell " as well as any bank account ! All we need ... IDMT pioneer . EX 2 butler Alpha 450 ... sucks , plugs and dries in any oxygen-based environment ... Retro-fratphammonia planets ? Can do ! Glad to hear it , but we 're lookin ' for someone with another name ... Hymo . Well you found me . What can I do for you ? I 'm Jac Weir , and this is my mother Caroline . Give it to me . You 're a droid ! You have amazing powers of observation . That 's unreal ... You 're practically perfect . Practically ? I 'm road-tested , son ... Simon created me to protect his secret . From everyone but you two , that is . For seven years I waited for you to come because my access level cannot ... the door to Simon 's lab . Only you , Jac , matches the DNA passcode . Mission complete ! Arthur ! Arthur ! Arthur ! Arthur ... Can you hear me ? Looks like his power pack 's been trashed . Oh ! I got an idea . Oh ! Mrs. Weir . I 'm so sorry for my ghastly appearance . At least you 're still in one piece . What happened , Arthur ? Where 's Simon ? In the Virgo cluster . 27.2 million light years away . This must be it . Dad 's secret project . It 's a Moebius Field Portal , based on the theory of " Internal Transfer Loops . " Maybe you could explain it a little more ... simply . When a three dimensional cylindrical loop is given a 180 degree twist , it becomes a two dimensional mathematical oddity known as a Moebius strip . By twisting two of the existing parameters of space , Professor Weir was able to manipulate the third parameter , which is distance ... You call that " simply " ? Professor Weir created a conduit to any location in the known universe . All you have to do is walk through here and you can go anywhere in the galaxy ! That 's how Simon wound up 30 million light years away ? Actually 27.2 . After the Professor went through the portal , he was attacked by one of the planet 's indigenous population . This foliage crashed through the gateway and disabled the Portal . My function was to protect Professor Weir . I did everything in my power to save him , but ... I failed . Can you get the Portal up and running ? That would depend on the extent of the damage . You did it ! Connection established and secured . The Professor 's safety specifications require a minimum Stability Factor of 90 % before accessing the Portal . Field integrity failing . It 's losing stability ! Jac ! I 'm going after my son ! No ! You will be vaporized ! Then bring it back on line ! Emergency shutdown initiated . Dad ? Dad ? How beautiful So much power inside it . I need the secret of this magic . Guards ! Shepway foretold that Ragis was the one who would restore Raphicca to glory . We cannot let her death prevent him from fulfilling his destiny . I 'm sorry Simon . You were so close to returning to your family . What pain you must be feeling . We 've all suffered . How could you betray me ? We did no such thing ! Shepway conspired with the rebels . The king was within his right to punish her . Stop ! Tor murdered Shepway . How dare you try to justify it . What does your intuition tell you , Ragis ? That Allana and I would be disloyal to you ? King Tor found Shepway 's crystal in the rebel cave . Proof of what ? Only that Shepway distrusted Tor . But Tor is the King of Raphicca . But Tor is the King of Raphicca . Tor is dragging Raphicca into the darkness ! Were you deaf to Shepway 's teachings ? You are the chosen one . Ragis The king who will lead us back into the light . I will assume the throne four moons from now on my 18th birthday . As custom dictates . You won 't live that long ! Shepway 's last words to me were , Seek your father 's truth . What " truth " ? Do you know how your father died ? He and Tor were on a journey to the outer lands . He was gored by a wild Espar . Did you see your father 's body ? No , only Shepway did . Shepway told us what she saw . There was one puncture wound through Akis ' chest . That 's impossible . Espar horns have a forked tip . No ! Only one . From Tor 's sword ! You accuse King Tor of killing my father ? ! His own brother ? ! I won 't hear of it ! Dad ? What ? Alright ... Ahh ... Tell me how you came to Raphicca , alien . Through a Moebius Field Portal . You know , the theory of internal transfer loops , you take a three dimensional cylindrical loop , give it a 180 degree twist , transform it into a two dimensional ... you are a spy for Tor . Who ? Look , I 'm trying to find someone . His name is ... Simon Weir . Simon ? Yeah , you know him ? He is a mentor to Prince Ragis . This uh ... Prince Ragis he 's one of the good guys , right ? Of course . Great ! Just what I wanted to hear . Simon Weir is my dad . Cut him loose ! I 've heard that the portal could bring me to other worlds ... I need your magic ... Shepway must have taught you . You see , Ragis ? She refuses to help us . Even though she helped those who betrayed us and her people . Maybe your little alien friend will convince you to help us . No ! Leave him alone ! This has nothing to do with Simon ... Please , don 't ... Proceed ! Stop ! I will do it ! Give her the crystal . So it is true . Imagine the world that will bow before me ! With this portal , I can build an army greater than any in the Galaxy . Don 't be too arrogant puny alien . My forces wait my command to enter your world and make you our slaves . How dare you talk to me like that ... Attack my minions . Take her back to the dungeon . I will be the greatest King Raffia has ever known ! Ragis ! ? Ragis ! ? Ragis ! ? Ragis ! ? Did you see your father 's body ? No , only Shepway did . Shepway told us what she saw . Puncture wounds . There was only one puncture wound through Akis ' chest . That 's impossible . Espar horns have a forked tip . There would have been two puncture wounds . No ! Only one . From Tor 's sword ! Noooo ! This is an irresistible Raphiccan delicacy . The brains of an Oda . Oh , en , yeah It looks great , really . But , uh ... I 'm allergic . Yeah , that 's it , I 'm allergic . To any food product from the neck up , you know , eyeballs , tongues , ears , and yes , I hate to say it , even brains . Too bad . Look , Bodkus , I really appreciate the feast and everything . But what I really need is to find my dad . Finding him isn 't the problem . He resides at Tor 's castle . Great , Ah , let 's go . We were the loyal servants to the former ruler of our kingdom , King Akis , until his life was taken by the hand of his own brother ... Tor . Uh huh , so I take it you and this Tor aren 't exactly close . We will never submit to the murderer Tor ! He has defiled the sacred teachings Look , Look , I wish you all the best in your fight , I really . But none of this has anything to do with my dad . That is where you are wrong , my small friend . Shepway taught you well . What do you think you are doing ? Ragis ! Grab hold . I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . Overcoming doubts will only strengthen you . It rightfully belongs with you now . Maybe we should think about getting out of here ? Oh ... of course . We might be able to escape through the rear entrance . There are fewer guards posted there . No , I have a plan . We must reach the upper balcony . Upper balcony ? Trust me . King tor , Ragis freed Allana and the alien ! Ah ... , Sound the alarm ! I thought you had a plan ! Now would be a good time to let us in on it . Follow me . Follow you where ? Over the balcony . What ? Told you I had a plan . Is Simon all right ? We have to go back for Simon . Tor has him by now . Tor 's army is almost at full strength . He will launch an offensive against us at the conclusion of the Festival of Light . We must mobilize the rebel troops . I will gather the warriors . We cannot launch an attack against the castle . It is too well fortified . We must engage Tor right here , in our territory , where we control the battlefield . You display the heart of an Espar , just like your father . It will be my honor to serve you , King Ragis . Touching . While you 're getting fitted for your crown , maybe you can spare a few guys to help me save my dad . Simon taught us humanity 's most cherished values ... He helped us to understand that by embracing those values we could defy Tor . But Raphicca is not my home . Ok or my father 's . He shouldn 't have to die to save it . If there is any way to rescue your father , Ragis will find it . Nobody loves Simon more than Ragis . Oh , Really ? I was only talking about Raphiccans , not Simon 's human family . Who 'm I kidding ? My dad 's been gone so long I don 't even know him anymore . You 're more his family now than I am . Nothing could be further from the truth , Jac . Simon missed you and your mother ... Save it ! Just leave me alone , will you ? The young human needs a friend Those were your fathers chambers ... in case you were wondering . Well , I wasn 't . Jac , I am deeply sorry about your father . Do you ? ! What would you know about it ? Too much , I 'm sad to say . I never even met my father . He died when I was quite young . From the moment Simon first arrived here , all he could talk about was how to get back home . Did my dad ... ever talk about me ? Every day . He would say hat joy would only come to him on the day he was reunited with you and your mother . He also believed in his heart that you and I would be fast friends . I told Simon that you could be the little brother I never had . Please help me save my dad , Ragis . I promise , Jac . But there is no way to penetrate the castle 's defenses . No way for a Raphiccan maybe . But Tor never thought about keeping humans out . What do you have in mind ? Need some help there , Arthur ? My back springs aren 't as young as they used to be . Ooh ... , My energy pack is almost drained . I 'm going to attempt to rescue Simon from the castle . That 's a suicide mission ! That 's a suicide mission ! This is something I must do for Simon . Jac has a plan . I believe it would work . So when do we leave ? Bodkus , I want you to stay with the troops . But ... We cannot afford in danger both of our lives . If the need rises , you would lead all over Raphiccan . Go with a light , my king . Ragis , I ... Bodkus would need your magic . I swear I will return . Ragis ! ... Be safe . I will One hundred years ago , my forefathers delivered our glorious kingdom back into the Light , after the Darkness had enveloped Raphicca for eons . ... All right ! But ... Raphiccans ! The son of Akis has betrayed you . The darkness has consumed him . At this very moment , he is plotting rebellion against the Kingdom , and ... He has enlisted this alien sorcerer to help him . But in the proud tradition of the House of Raheem , I will lead our kingdom in crushing this rebellion and bring peace back to our lands . My only recourse to defeat the growing rebel forces and defend our freedom was to rebuild the Raphiccan army . Your overwhelming approval of my strategy will not go unrewarded . The proud army of Raphicca will emerge victorious . This is my way in . Now for you ... You 'd get a seat in that way . Nice look . You smell ... Once we annihilate the rebels and kill Prince Ragis , our power over them will be absolute . I have a treat for you . Dad ! ... Dad , wake up it 's me , Jac . Jac . Look at you . You 're all grown up . Enough ! Find the sorcerer . Enter the coordinates for the Virgo Cluster . I 've tried . Confirm spatial differential . Far side telemetry initiated . Connection established and secured . Mom gave me this on the way to Callisto . Jac . Simon . Caroline ! ? Mom How 'd you get here ? Jac told me the portal was practically destroyed . Good thing I can read your sloppy handwriting . Your notes . I used them to rewire the portal . With Arthur 's help of course . The gateway is stable , Simon . We can go home . I owe you my life . And so much more . On the contrary , my friend , I am in your debt . Thank you for sharing your father with me , Jac . We are going to miss you . Fare well . Tor is mobilizing his army ! We 're not prepared ... We need more time . We 're not leaving . This is not your war . You and your family have sacrificed far too much already . Listen , big guy , on my planet families stick together . Understand what I 'm saying ... brother ? Jac 's right , we are one family now . Now I understand . Good , then let 's take care of business . Now ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! King Tor . They 've set traps throughout the forest . Is that the best they can do ? Release the catapults and fire the cannons . Prepare the catapults . Fire ! Charge , charge ! Get me down there . I 'll crush them myself ! You have to go on without me , my king . A good friend once told me , Overcoming your fears only makes you stronger . Today we face an enemy whose sole purpose is to annihilate us , My father and Shepway believed in the ways of the light . We will not let their deaths be in vain . We will fight , we will be victorious We will bring our world back into the light . March with me brave warriors of Raphicca Let us face our destiny ! You should died by the same hand as your father did . How poetic . My father was murdered because he trusted you . There will be no more killing . The prophecy has come true Ragis ! .. Ragis , Ragis ... My brothers . Our Kingdom has been perverted by one man 's lust for power . He has killed your King , his own brother , to feed his lust . And plunged us into darkness . Seize Tor . Fools ! I am commander of the armies of this Kingdom , and soon I will command the armies of the universe . Raphicca will kneel before me . Tor has the crystal . He must not succeed . Take care of Allena . Ragis must not go alone . Don 't worry . He is not . Wait , Ragis . Brother ? Brother . If Raphicca 's armies will not stand behind me , then they shall fall before a more powerful one . The future is mine . Jack ! All right . Can we go home now ? By the order of the light and the guardians of the great realm , It is my honor to bestow upon the the crown of Raphicca . Wear it well , my King ! You know , I was thinking . Now that we 've got the Moebius Field Portal up and running , why stop here ? Think about all the planets we could check out . You 've got to be kidding . I 've been dealing with him for the last 7 years . It 's your turn now ... Of course , we 'd all go together next time , and maybe even take Arthur with us . And speaking of Arthur ...

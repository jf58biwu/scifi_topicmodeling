 'The flu crisis deepened today ' , The entire population has already been exposed . The virus , causes our own immune systems to turn against us . The Prime Minister died a few minutes ago . I urge you all to behave responsibly . to be good neighbours and to avoid panic . You survive the plague and get killed over something silly like this . Argh ! Abby , don 't do this ! 'lf I recovered , maybe my son did too . 'He could be out there some _ here ... Peter ! That 's Phil Emerson .. . with Peter . Take it . 'l mean , he could be out there right now , looking for me ' ... Peter ! 'So few of us left . ' Thank you . ' ... Every new person feels like a gift . ' Everything we ever knew has been ripped away from us . Our old life is dead . Now , we have to build a new one . And we can 't do it alone . There is only one choice . We stand together or die . Here we go ... Yeah . Coming in ... Through her legs. thank you ! How many ? Three-nil. four-nil ? One-nil . Five-nil . One-nil . We need more snacks . Peanuts , pistarhios , that kind of thing . Oh , and some wine . The good stuff . Nothing under a tenner . Have fun ! If we left him alone , he 'd staye to death waiting for the supermarket to deliver . Let 's get going before the shops shut . Naj , Greg made a joke ! Yeah. it wasn 't funny though . THEY SHOUT EXCITEDLY Where you going ? Won 't be long . Just going to check something out . Abby ! Anya ! Let 's get out of here , come on . Let 's go ! Doing a bit of shopping ? We needed food and drink . So you thought you 'd just steal it ? What ? People have to know this place belongs to us . They need to respect our property . You need to give that back now . Oi ! Don 't you touch him ! I wouldn 't . You seem like nice people , so I 'm gonna give you a break . Come on . We 'll be watching . Can 't you see how wrong this is ? What , what are you looking at ? Just want to make sure I remember your face . You 'd better . Do you really think they killed him ? Who knows ? Maybe he was dead already . The point is , they 're capable of it . I reckon in their minds , they 've already crossed the line . This is exactly why I wanted to get away from everyone . Abby ? Are you OK ? Yeah. I 'm fine . Look , not eveyone is gonna be like them . There are going to be a lot of good people left in the world . Well , being good isn 't enough any more . We need to be organised . I mean , this isn 't a game . This is real now . GUNSHOT Woo ! MORE GUNSHOTS Come on . They were just trying to frighten you . You weren 't there . All right , so we 'll just stay out of their way . You think they 're going to be the only ones like that ? Whay I 'm saying is let 's not panic , all right ? It 's not Lord Of The Rings yet , is it ? Flies . You mean Lord Of The Flies . Yeah , right . The one with the fat kid . They killed someone . Al . Doesn 't that mean anything to you ? Of course it does . Look , we could be in danger , evey time we go out looking for food . We 've still got plenty of stuff . Sooner or later. eveything easy will be gone . What are you going to do then ? You really want this to be a nightmare , don 't you ? No , I want you to face reality . Something you seem to have a problem with . I don 't need lessons in reality from you , my friend . Greg 's right . What 's left in the shops won 't last forever . We need to grab eveything we can before someone else does . Fight them for it , if we have to . Not if we end up like those people in the supermarket . We are still human beings . All the rules have changed now . And the sooner we all realise that , the better the chance we 've got of staying alive . Sarah ? What time is it ? late . I never eat breakfast . I told you that . But it was a nice gesture . Thank you . Bob . That car was outside again . Did they see you ? Do you think they know about this place ? If they did , they 'd be here by now . Haven 't you got work to do ? I just thought , er .. . If you must . Tom. I 'm just going out to get a few things . I 'll come with you .. . just in case . I don 't see why we can 't just leave it . We 'll get rats. I hate rats . I saw them on the streets , before you found me . They were just .. . scampering about in the open . it was like somehow . they knew we 'd gone . I could do with some help . I couldn 't . The smell 's disgusting . Getting ill doesn 't really bear thinking about , does it ? A small cut could become tetanus . A cough , pneumonia . Makes you feel quite vulnerable . Unless you happen to know a friendly doctor . look. I don 't want the others to know . Why not ? Different life . Different person . How about you ? What did you do before ? I robbed things . Killed a few people . That 's not funny . Oh , it , er , it had its moments . Fine. I don 't care , anyway . You know . We 're alike , you and I . We both know that who we were doesn 't matter any more . It 's who we are now that counts . How long will all this last ? A lifetime . Not now. I 'm thinking . Once we 've built up the local business . We can start running trucks to other places . Who 's going to drive them ? We 'll recruit people we can trust . In a few years , it 'll be a national business . I 'll be rich . We 'll be rich . Of course . What did I say ? You 're very beautiful . You 're always saying that . Find me some decent red wine . I don 't like cheap champagne . Tastes like metal . Agh ! Argh ! So , from now on . We go out foraging evey day . We treat it like a job . If anyone 's got a problem with that , say so now . OK . Greg . Tom and I will cover the supermarkets today . Al . Anya and Najid . you look for the smaller shops . And there 's something else . We all know that there 's plenty of food and water out there . But .. . a lot of it isn 't going to be in the shops . You mean houses ? Good food is no use to the dead . That 's pretty cold. isn 't it ? If we don 't do it , someone else will . Look , I know how hard it is . But the way I see it . We 've got no choice . Er. listen. I found this in the supermarket . It 's a .. . delivey note from the central distribution warehouse . I know this area . My husband did some work there once . There might be some valuable stuff there. I 'll check it out . We can all go. I travel better alone . You 're not thinking of walking out on us. are you . Greg ? If I was. I 'd tell you . You came here yesterday. didn 't you ? You could have told me . I thought you wouldn 't rome . You don 't like being pushed around . I admire that . I 'm like it myself . Well. looks like no-one 's here . I guess I 'm your lucky charm . HORN BEEPS continuously What are you doing ? There was a man here yesterday . I have to see him again . Well. don 't just stand there ! Come on . Idiot ! So , you 've never even met this Emerson character before ? That 's him . You reckon he was here yesterday ? I ... I think so . It looked like him. I don 't know . But if it is him. he 'll know what 's happened to Peter . for you .. . . .for keeping us all together . What happened to you . Tom ? Why were you attacked ? I hitched a lift with the wrong people. that 's all . They beat me up and then chucked me out of the car . You don 't strike me as the kind of man who gets taken by surprise . Come on. let 's go . We 're pushing our luck . That 's them . let me do the talking . My friend wants to ask you a question . Check in the back . You. get out of the car ! I told you to stay away ! You 're out of order. mate . You know that . Shut up ! is he here ? No . Who are you talking about ? A ... A guy called Phil Emerson . She thinks that she saw him here with you yesterday. this is him , he knows what happened to my son . On your knees . Wh ... What ? Get down on the ground . You too . Get down ! Just keep nice and calm. mate. eh ? Ah ... Ah .. . I told you to stay away from my stuff . Did you think I was joking ? No , no ! Then why did you come back ? I told you . I was looking for someone . Don 't give me that bullshit ! You 're thieving . No ! I told you to shut up ! Ah ! Now. next time. pay attention . I don 't want to see you here again . SHE SOBS You 're all right . Come on . You 've got to help me . Bob 's badly hurt . Well. I tried to move him but he 's in terrible pain . Well. he was screaming all night . I couldn 't stand it . He 's in the warehouse . Didn 't you hear me ? Yeah. yeah. I heard you . This way .. . Hurry ! Er . What 's your name ? Sarah . I 'm Greg . You left him like this ? Well. I couldn 't move it on my own . It 's a compound fracture . We 're going to have to reset the bone . What have you given him for the pain ? We need some painkillers . And. er .. . any. any bandages or swabs we ran find . Bob ? Bob. can you hear me ? listen. mate . you 've broken your leg . Erm. you might want to hold his hand or something . I 'd look away now. if I were you . I was talking to him . Uh ... Argh ! I was so scared . I thought he was going to kill me . It 's gonna be madness out there now. isn 't it ? You know what your problem is ? You think that people are basically good .. . but they 're not . When it comes down to it . We 'll do anything to get what we want . Anything . I don 't believe you . We 're better than that . We have to be . The world 's a bad place . Abby . Always was . now there 's no ... there 's no civilisation left . there 's no protection . We 're seeing each other for what we really are and it 's not pretty . You need to get used to that . I need a new jacket . You 've got clothes . Take a tip from me . you 've got to look good .. . to feel good . You see ? God wants me to have this jarket . You 're wasting time . Naj . you 're going to have to lighten up . It 's like having Jiminy bloody Cricket in my ear the whole time . Oh. look . a sweet shop. your lucky day . Go and have some fun . What about you ? I 'm busy . I need some new shirts . Aah .. . You people ! Help ! Al. help ! You 're like wolves ! 'Al. help ! ' Steeling my stuff ! Help ! Al. help me ! What 're you doing ? ! Get off him ! Get out ! Agh ! Aah ... Get off ! let 's get out of here . We can 't just leave him . He 's dead . Come on . Come on ! You didn 't mean to hurt him . We should pray for him . Naj ? We don 't tell anyone about this . Come on . let 's get Anya . What 's wrong ? Nothing . What happened to your arm ? l. er. I slipped . Banged it . Well. let me look at it . It 's fine . It 's just a bruise . Naj ? Everything OK ? Yeah . Makes you feel like a thief . doesn 't it ? Will he be able to walk again ? The gangrene will kill him long before you have to worry about that . He needs antibiotics . Well. there 's a chemist in the town . We can be there in 20 minutes . Yeah . We 'll. er . we 'll wait until dark . Why ? No-one knows we 're here . let 's keep it that way . I 'm not frightened . You should be . You know . maybe something 's happened to him . Or maybe he 's just walked out on us . No. he wouldn 't do that . He was talking about going off on his own . Mmm , talking about it all the time . No. he said he 'd come back . I trust him . Never trust anybody and you 'll never be disappointed . If that 's how you live . I feel sorry for you . He 's a big boy . I 'm sure he can look after himself . He 'll come back when he wants to . If he wants to . I hate drinking on my own . Come on. someone join me . You 're a Muslim . You shouldn 't be drinking .. . Uh. uh. shouldn 't you be in bed ? Yeah. all right . I could use a drink . Go to bed . Abby . We 'll stay up for him . OK. goodnight . Goodnight . I 'm tired too . Night . What are you doing ? Finding the right drugs for Bob . Was the virus bad where you were ? About the same as eveywhere. I expect . My mother died early on . And then Daddy went as well . I didn 't know what to do. I .. . I just walked about for ages . living off chorolate and chewing gum . Then Bob found me . He was the manager of our local supermarket . He said he 'd seen me shopping there and fallen in love from a distance . That 's a bit creepy. isn 't it ? He went to the warehouse when things got bad . He knew how much food there was . I suppose it was quite clever of him . So now you two are ... I didn 't have any choice . He forced you ? He told me he wouldn 't look after me if I didn 't do what he wanted . CAR ENGINE AND SCREECHING Come . This is new . Come on . Dexter . It 's a bloody book shop ! Hmm . You can learn a lot from books . What do you miss most from before ? My family . Friends . And boyfriend ? I didn 't have a boyfriend . How about you ? What do you miss ? My laptop . What ? It 's true . We spent a lot of time together . It was smart .. . sensitive. easy to handle . Oh. you must have been vey sad when it died . I don 't want to talk about the past . No point . What 's done is done .. . . .and you can 't change it . To life . life . You 're vey beautiful . Why do I get the impression .. . that you don 't take me seriously ? Be honest ! You 're only interested because I 'm the last resort . That 's not true . Oh. come on. please ? I really need some company tonight . I understand . Al. I do . But I 'm not the one . I 'm going to bed. now . No ... ! On my own . What you doing ? I thought there might be someone out there. but it 's just static . Do you think the people that own this house mind us living in it ? I don 't think so . I wouldn 't want someone sleeping in my bedroom. I 'd come and haunt them . You know. one day we 'll find somewhere where we can make a fresh start . We 'll grow our own food . maybe keep a few animals . Cows , sheep , chickens . that sort of thing . My dad said I should look for my cousins . But they 're probably all dead. aren 't they ? If there 's someone out there . Najid . We 'll find them one day. I promise . Come on . Get some sleep . Night. night . Night . What is that ? Penicillin . Will it stop the wound from getting infected ? It 'd better . Othwise you 'll have to amputate his leg . Come on . Bob . Get these down you . Well done . He 'll need two. three times a day . There 's nothing more I can do here . Good luck . Where are you going ? My friends will be expecting me back . You can 't go now . Please . I can 't be alone tonight . All right . I 'll get the brandy . You realise how valuable all this stuff is ? Of course I do . This place is my ticket to a decent life . I 'll trade with people for the things that I need . Or they 'll work for me . growing vegetables and things . I can pay them with goods . Who knows ? I might even end up wealthy . Money won 't be much use to you . We 're bound to need money again one day. life won 't always be grim . You really think you can hang onto this place ? Why shouldn 't I ? There are people who 'd slit your throat for a bottle of water . I 'm sure someone will protect me . What about you . Greg ? Do you have plans ? I did . But they changed . Why ? I met some people . The friends you were talking about ? There was this woman . Abby . What she said made sense . But you don 't owe her anything . Not exactly . Um. I 'm drunk . I 'm going to bed . Good idea . I 've been so lonely . Greg . You 've been through a lot . You 're traumatised . We all are . If this happens now . how am I any better than Bob ? This is different . I want you . I 'm not staying . Sarah . Sleeping with me isn 't going to help that . is it because of this Abby ? Not like that . Well. then why not ? I just think it 's better for both of us . We have to share the bed . I 'll take the sofa . Suit yourself . If you change your mind . you know where l am . Sorry . Good morning . Good morning . Still no sign of Greg ? I 'll go and wake Naj . You know you 're doing a good job with him . Al . His parents would be grateful . If Peter is alive. I hope he 's found someone like you . You 're tying to do too much . You 'll hurt yourself again . I don 't like lying around . Fine . Do what you like . I 'm sorry . I 'll be a good boy. I promise . No more than 20 minutes exercise a day . OK . Whatever you say . Doc . Don 't call me that . You saved my life . Anya . That makes us connected . I owe you one . I can look after myself . The world 's going to be a dangerous place now . The weak need protecting . I 'm not weak . You 're actually excited by all this. aren 't you ? Don 't go , Greg . Stay with me. I can 't . Bob 's going to die . We both know that . I told you I don 't love him . I couldn 't . There 's enough food and drink in here to last forever . I 've got a better idea . Why don 't you get some stuff . put it in the car. come with me . What ? You 'll like my friends . They 're good people . What about my business ? That 's just a dream . Sarah . You 're worse than Bob . At least he understood . look. if I found this place . other people will . I don 't want you getting hurt . We could make this work . Greg. please . I saw the address. I know the area . Face it. he 's not coming bark . You 're wrong . Are you sure . Abby ? You don 't know him . You know , he might have been attacked . He could be lying somewhere injured . I can 't just stand around here doing nothing. thinking he might need our help . You 're being naive . It could be any one of us out there . I 'm going to find him . Sarah .. . I saved your life . I gave you what you wanted . That makes us quits . I love you ! What use is that now ? What .. .what are you doing ? Sarah ? Sarah ! THUD Sarah ! She 's gonna get herself killed . What you looking at ? You . I 'm going after her . Naj ? let 's go . Sory. did I make you jump ? Do you know what I like about you ? You 're the type of guy that makes people feel great about themselves . Thanks . It 's a gift. that . You should use it wisely . Just one more thing . If you ever make a move on Anya again. I 'm gonna break your neck . What. is this a joke ? look. if you guys are together ... She doesn 't want you near her any more . See you later . I didn 't think you 'd mind . At least do me a favour before you go ? I 've had a flat tyre for ages . Bob always said he 'd fix it. but .. . I don 't think he really wanted to . Thought I might drive away . Where 's the spare ? In the boot. I suppose . Are you all right ? Fine . I can 't stop thinking about that old man . Just leave it out all right . Naj ? ! look ! Abby said we 'd grow our own stuff one day . Have animals and that . Come on ! Come here . Come here. you chicken ! Come here . Get it. quick ! I got him . Naj ! I got him ! I killed him . You must be Abby . It 's not what you think . It doesn 't matter what I think . I just wanted to know you were OK . Now I do. I 'll go . Oh , don 't look so bloody wounded . She 's got an injured man in there . She couldn 't manage . It 's a gold mine . Enough food and drink to last us a lifetime . And it 's mine . The offer still stands . Greg . What offer ? Well. half of eveything if he stays with me . And the answer 's no . It was always no . I don 't belong here . Well. I 've done my best . But for some reason . he seems quite attached to you . Apology accepted . look. let 's just take what we need and then we 'll go . I 'm starting a business . This is my stock . look . Whatever 's in there belongs to eveyone . This place is mine ! I worked for it. I 'm entitled ! Don 't be so stupid . You can 't have it ! It 's mine ! That 's enough . Sarah . Get off ! Get off me ! For God 's sake , Greg. just leave it ! Abby . We need this food . It 's not worth fighting for . If that 's how we 're going to live. I 'd rather die . You were warned . This is my territory . You 're trespassing . This is ridiculous ! Find out what they 've got in there . Tell her not to take another step . Dexter . Who told you my name ? You can learn a lot from books . look. I 'm tying to be nice . I don 't want anyone hurt . Who the hell do you think you are ? This is my property . I 'll kill you if I have to . You 're not gonna believe this . We 've hit the jackpot . You think yourselves lucky . SARAH : This place belongs to me ! I 'm sorry . Change of ownership. darling . You 're welcome to stay. though . I 'm a vey generous employer . Sorry about the slap . GUNSHOT What. you want some ? Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Eh ? Hard man. eh ? You think I won 't use it. huh ? You 've only got one shot in there . Go for it . You better make sure you kill me though . Shoot him and I 'm still here . Trust me. I 'll even up the score before you can blink . Odds don 't sound as good now. do they ? Shut it ! Both of you . You can start a small war . Or you can put the gun down . We 'll all go about our business . Your choice . I 'm having a vey nice day today . Why spoil it ? You better go while I 'm still in a good mood . Go on ! Take me with you ! You can 't leave me with them ! Aren 't you forgetting something ? Bob 's dead . Greg. let 's go ! Get in . GUNSHOT Next time . Dexter ! Come here ! Help me .. .please. Come on . You 're OK now . You know. you were wrong about Greg . This time . Why did you come looking for us ? I had nothing better to do . Maybe human nature 's not so bad then. eh ? You can believe that if you want . Abby ! look. eggs ! Me and Al found some chickens . We 're having omelettes for tea . We 're gonna keep animals and stuff. like you said . Abby ! This is Sarah . She 'll be staying with us . Hi . Hi . Hi . Sarah . Do you like eggs ? Come on. let me show you the chickens . How did you know he wouldn 't shoot you ? Just a hunch . CAR ALARM BEEPING There 's an intruder in the basement car park . Has he seen anything ? I don 't think so . What 's he doing ? Scavenging. by the look of it . Alert serurity and tell them to take action . If he gets in . We 're dead . There 's no chance of that . We 're completely secure . For how long ? Suppose he brings other people here ? The work 's too important . We can 't take that chance . CAR ALARM No contact of any kind With any living thing ! I do know you . You 're in the government . This place . What you 're doing . it 's eveything I 've dreamt of . But I don 't want to go home ! Kate. you can 't go back . Come on . We have no idea how many of them are out there . Guilty or not guilty ? I don 't want to be locked up any more . If we don 't hit them now . and hit them hard .. . they 'll be back again . and again and again . Justice and mercy . This is our law . You were talking in your sleep . It was a bad dream . I have to tell the police . That you saw her in a dream ? Yeah. good luck with that ( ! )

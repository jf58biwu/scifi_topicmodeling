 There is no doubt it 's the beginning of great tribulation . Don 't be blind to what the government is trying to do ! ... and democracy . One world government . Take heed , my brothers . These things are happening now . We must remain vigilant . Tonight 's top story , the UN Charter becomes void as the last two remaining countries in the world surrender their now worthless paper money and economic autonomy to join Global Alliance . With worldwide acceptance of Global credits and biological chip security implants , financial stability is being restored . Biomedical encoding , satellite tracking , the BEAST chip ... And for all the brothers and sisters who are now being persecuted throughout the world , we especially want to lift up Adam Riley , whose execution is now drawing near . Heavenly Father , our deliverer ... It was just a formality today when the sentence of Adam Riley was upheld in court . The execution will now take place as it was previously scheduled . The need for borders is gone . We are living the dream of man since time began . We are one people ! We are Global ! ... principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world . Against ... - Lord Jesus , we praise you . - Hallelujah . - Thank you , Lord . Thank you . - Father , we praise you . - Dear Jesus , I pray a blessing ... - ... we lift up our voices and praise you . - You 're that FBI agent . - Former agent . You know , it 's funny . You don 't look like no domestic terrorist . This man look like a domestic terrorist to you , Rex ? No , sir . He ain 't no terrorist . No , sir . He ain 't no terrorist . No , Rex . What we have here is a travesty of justice . You open your mouth to speak your mind and look at what they do to you . Yes , sir . Yeah , but one day ... " My time is in your hands . " Deliver me from my enemies and those that pursue me . " - That right , brother ? - Amen . Amen . Good day , gentlemen . How you guys doing ? It 's hot . The AC 's busted in this thing . - Where are you taking these guys ? - Sorry . Need to know only . Just scan me so we can get out of here . I 'm gonna have to ask you guys to step out of the van . You idiot ! You almost got me killed in there , boy ! Sorry , boss . Things just got a little out of control . A little out of ... Man , just get me out of here . - Rex ! - Howey ! - Good to see you , brother . - Come on . There you go . - Free at last , baby . - Free at last . Come on , son . Put some oomph in it . Get me out of here . - Come on , come on . - Good to see you boys . - Give me some love . - All right . - Get this metal off me now . - Yeah , baby . There we go . - Rex . - Been released from the shadow of death . Zebra 109 , come in . - Good to see you , man . - Zebra 109 , come in . - Ten more minutes , I thought we were done . - Zebra 109 , come in , please . Zebra 109 , report your 20 . That 's heaven there . Come on , boys . You coming with ? We 're on the same team , brother . We want the same thing ! - I don 't think so . - Have it your way . But remember , brother . They strike you , you strike back harder . " An eye for an eye . " It 's the truth , brother . And one day , you 'll see ! Welcome to Global Supermarket , bringing the world to you . Thank you , Mr Henley . That 'll be 115.29 points . - Have a nice day . - Thank you . ... bananas are just . 20 credits for two kilos . Potatoes are 0.99 ... That 'll be 19.99 . Please ? Just once , please ? I 'm really hungry . No , don 't do that . Don 't do that . Please don 't . Global Supermarket , bringing the world to you . Ma 'am , could you come with me ? All right . Move on . Is it me , or is Global stepping up their presence out here ? Halt . Halt . You would think in a place with no ZIP code they 'd leave you alone . - Zebra 147 , come in . - All right . Move forward . - You 're okay . All right , move along . - Zebra 147 , Zebra 109 is not reporting in . - Go for Zebra 147 . - We could turn around , but they 'd chase us . Investigate , report their 20 and their condition . Copy . Hey , we got a unit that 's not reporting in . We gotta go . You sure it 's okay to wait ? Have faith . Come on ! We got to go ! All right , move along . Come on . Come on ! Thanks . Come on . - That was close . - Prayer is a powerful thing , Doc . Yeah , it is , Jacob . We would 've been busted on so many counts . No biological implant tracking devices . Smuggled Bibles . Contraband food , cash , you name it . We definitely would 've ended up as guests at Hotel Global . But we have friends there . Well , I guess that 's not what the good Lord had planned for us today . I guess not , Doc . I guess not . We lost sight of the suspects . Adam , what 's your 20 ? George is on the run . I 'm in pursuit . Charles , where 's our backup ? - Go around . Cut him off . - Yeah . Yeah , I got it . Charles , we 're heading toward the old docks . Copy . ... fight ? He 's got that . - Hey ! Hey ! Where 's the other one ? - The other one got away . But this one just wasn 't quite fast enough , was you ? It 's a crazy stunt to pull . - Yeah . But no one lives forever , right ? - Yeah , right , I 'll go get the ... Drop it , buddy . You don 't wanna do this , man . Don 't do it . I said , drop it . Adam ? I think I 've been shot . No good music around any more . Not a gospel song in sight . What can wash away my sin ? Nothing but the blood of Jesus What can make me whole again ? Nothing but the blood of Jesus Oh , precious is the flow Makes me white as snow No other fount I know Nothing but the blood of Jesus - Man , you sound pretty good . - Not bad yourself , too , Doc . Not bad at all . I need the mask on him . Keep calm , buddy , keep calm . We 're doing everything we can for you . Everything 's gonna be fine , just keep calm . It 's okay , buddy . It 's okay . Calm down , okay ? We 're losing him . We 're losing him . Why , Charles , you look like the devil himself . Yeah . Good to see you , too . Now , what do you want ? It 's not what I want . It 's what your government wants . - Really ? - Really . Yeah , my government . - You may leave now . - Charles , you don 't understand . I 've been assigned to bring you back to headquarters . My friend , you 've been reactivated . The answer 's no . Just leave me alone . Well , shame really . Lovely girl . And in prison ? - For sedition , no less . - What have you done with her ? Okay , this is all I want . You infiltrate a band of terrorists , religious extremists , we 'll say , led by an old acquaintance of yours . I think you know the man . Jacob Krause . And , by the way , while you 're there , I want you to bring in another old friend . - Adam Riley . - Adam ? Adam 's on death row and has no ... Adam has escaped in transport to be executed , - killing two Global Enforcement soldiers . - You got the wrong guy . Charles , you were raised in the church . You know how to speak the language of these people . You know how to talk to them . You 're a good person , Charles . People trust you . Adam trusts you . You could blend in . What guarantee do I have that you won 't kill her ? None . Jeez , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? The biological chip has been extracted , sir . Charles , you 've just become a wanted man . Brother . - Hey . - How 's George ? Well , they lost him in the ambulance , but then he was revived . I got a couple of shirts in the car if you want to change . - Okay . - Okay . Adam , tell me he 's gonna be okay . - Katherine . Katherine . - Adam , tell me ... Katherine , he 's fine . Okay ? He 's just fine . He 's a strong guy , okay ? Katherine Harris ? - Yes . - Your husband 's asking for you . It 's okay . It 's okay . - Charles , what happened ? - Your husband 's looking for you . I 'm all right . It 's not my blood . Okay , come on , let 's go clean you up . Come on . Hey . - Hey , you . - It 's so good to see you . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah . I 'm okay . - Are you sure ? - I 'm fine . God , you brought me out here . I need help , Lord . I need help . Help . Water . Water . Bottle of water . Water . Thank you , God . Okay . That 's not gonna work . I hope you 're my size , buddy . I died , Adam . I died and I came back . And you know what ? It ... It wasn 't like all those stories you always hear about . No bright lights , no angels , no peace . It made me start thinking about God . Hey , you 're gonna be just fine , okay ? You 'll be back to work in no time . I started ... I started reading this book . Man , I had one of these on the shelf for years and I never touched it . Let me tell you , there 's some pretty trippy stuff in here . Like what ? Look . Like here , " Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign . " The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son . " They will call him Immanuel , God with us . " That 's the Old Testament . What does that mean ? Well , then there 's the New Testament about the life of Jesus , and what I found out was this first part was written centuries , centuries before the birth of Jesus . - So ? - So ? Jesus fulfilled the prophecy . - From centuries before ? - Exactly , man , exactly . Like I said , bro . Some pretty trippy stuff in here . All right . Hold it right there . Stand up and turn around . What are you doing here ? I was ... My van broke down . I was on foot . I needed water . This was my aunt 's place . You 're trespassing , mister . Okay . Sorry . Put the Bible down and nobody gets hurt . Okay . Brother ! Brother ! Okay , okay . All right , we 're all good . We 're good . Yeah . You have your orders . You have your transponder . When and if you encounter the target , you will turn on your transponder . We will be there within five minutes . - Do you understand ? - Perfectly . Government credit card and some cash to use as bait . Don 't waste it . Here 's a map of the local area . When do you release my wife ? No one made any guarantees . Now there are several bands of religious extremists in this area . Find one . Blend in . And you 're listed as a fugitive . No one in Global but my unit knows who you are or what you 're doing . - Do I make myself clear ? - Crystal . Do not mess this up . As if I had a choice . - What in blazes was that about ? - Want us to find out ? This is a very interesting development , boys . This might have something to do with Mr FBI , Rex . Maybe he 's a Bible thumper . Or maybe he 's a spy for Global . - Perhaps , son . Perhaps . - You want us to follow him ? Yeah , but don 't get too close . I don 't want you to tip him off . Now , why doesn 't Global just raid the area ? They 're waiting for something , Rex . Maybe for Mr FBI there to get flushed out . Or maybe they sent him in , you know , to disrupt the Bible thumpers , get them all riled up , fighting against each other , struggling for survival . Yeah , you 're right . Why fight ? They always have enough . Yeah , and our supplies are so low , sir . Maybe we can just ask them to help - or see if they can share ... - I 'm not begging anybody for anything ! And I 'm definitely not gonna defile my body by inserting some government chip ! - I will provide , Rex . Do you hear me , boy ? - Yes , sir . - I will provide ! - Yes , sir . So , anyway , we have Bible study every Wednesday , you know , just trying to keep things normal . After the Rapture , everything 's changed . You know , my aunt knew all about this . She read the Bible every day . She told me everything . I should 've listened . Hey ! Hey , everybody ! Hey , everybody , come out here ! I want to introduce you to somebody . Come on out , you guys ! Come on ! Come on , Adam . - Hey , everybody , this is Adam . - Hey , brother , hallelujah ! He 's a brother in the Lord , and he 's gonna be staying with us a few days . - Hi . Nice to meet you . I 'm Adam . - Good to meet you . Everyone , let 's make him feel right at home . Hey , brother . Welcome . - Thank you . - Adam , whatever we have is yours . - There 's always enough . - God bless you . - Hey , Adam , glad to have you with us . - Carissa ? Hey , I 'll be right back . My God . What are you doing here ? - It 's so good to see you . - It 's good to see you . Adam , this is my husband , Richard . - I guess you know my wife . - Nice to meet you . It 's nice to meet another brother in the Lord . I 'm just gonna take a hike over to the second cluster . They asked for some supplies , so I 'll be back before dark . - Adam . - Richard . What are you doing here ? I can 't believe what I heard about you . Is everything okay ? Yeah , yeah . It 's been a rough couple of years , - but it 's so good to see you . - Hey , Adam , Adam , come here . - Yeah , yeah . - I want to introduce you to some people . Just give me a couple of minutes . - Come on . - I haven 't seen her in a long time , okay ? I have to help with the food . We can talk in the Lord 's timing . Come on , we 've got some really great people living here . - Okay . - They 're gonna love you . Ain 't no use in looking at that thing . I only got burgers , cola , coffee and water . - Stupid Global rationing . - Water . Two fifty . What is this ? Are you trying to pull something over on me ? Look . I just want to pay and leave . Let go of my arm , please . I should turn you in to the authorities . I 'd get a big reward . - Caleb . - I was just leaving . What do you think you 're doing ? - You gotta be kidding me . - He 's clean . Can 't be too careful these days . You could get yourself into a whole lot of trouble flashing that cash around . It 's a good thing you came upon us , Mr Baker . Yeah . I thought you guys were trusting . - Sly as serpents and innocent as lambs . - Like lambs . We 'll get you to a safe place , then turn you over to The Way . I 'm just waiting for your file to come up . Man , the Internet is slow out here . Where 'd you get that ? That belongs to Global . God provides . It seems Mr Baker , here , is a religious extremist . Caleb , you 'll take Mr Baker to Nick . Be careful out there . Welcome , brother . Just a few more things . Caleb , get me the scan jam over there . - Okay . - Scan jam , what 's that ? It looks dangerous . - It ain 't good for electronic stuff . - It kills bugs . How does it do that ? We can go get him , Colonel . No , I 'm waiting . - Fries them . - For the proper time . - As long as it doesn 't hurt . - Yeah . - To get the big fish . - You won 't feel a thing . - What was that ? - What was that ? A deactivating pulse . We lost contact , Colonel . Global . Credits , man , tracking chips , it 's all to control us , brethren . I mean , this place it 's like Babylon the great here now , - a home for evil and demons . - That 's right . I don 't know what 's happened with them . Now , they 'll just kill you . Didn 't Global burn your brother 's place because he wouldn 't implant the B chip ? Yes , they did . But he was weak , and he had to perish . That 's right . What if we get Global to round up a few of them ? Then we could just sweep in there and raid the stash . Ain 't that dangerous ? Howey , what 's the matter ? You chicken ? Ease back , brethren . Ease back . Ease back now . Rex , your heart is where your treasure is . And , Howard , don 't you worry . We 're gonna get that mother lode of supplies from them Bible thumpers . God helps those that helps themselves . - Ain 't that right , Captain ? - Sure is . Those that help themselves . It 's like he can 't be seen . I tell you , it 's God 's hand on that man . I mean , he 's like Paul . The prison doors open , and he just walks away . You know , I don 't think he likes being called Houdini , though . - He gives all the glory to God . - Who are you talking about ? A friend . True apostle of God . He keeps slipping out of the hands of our enemies against all odds . Hey , maybe our friend Adam here is like that , too . - They 're here . - They 're back . - Who ? - Houdini . And his lovely assistant . Here , take this , take this . Come on . I want to introduce you . Houdini is incredible . You 're gonna love him . - Adam , this is Jacob . - Jacob ? Adam ? If someone would 've told me I 'd see you again among the living , I would 've told them they were crazy . And I thought I had the gift of prophecy . - What are you doing here ? - Feeding his sheep ! Well , that 's it . That 's all the food . I traded the rest of it for gas . What are we gonna do now ? - Captain ? - I 'm thinking , boy . Next time they 're on the road , that 's when we 'll get them . They say the Lord helps those that helps themselves . Yes , sir . One moment , sir . It 's HQ , Colonel . Yes , sir . Things are going according to plan , sir . We 're making progress . Thank you , sir . - I 'm readjusting that , sir . - You will not be disappointed . - Looks like a technical problem . - Fix it . Yes ? We lost satellite contact , Colonel . Solar flares . So , Nick , tell me again . How did you find Adam ? - I was checking in on my aunt ... - Richard . - Hey . - Hey . I need you and Doc to go to cluster six . I 've got letters to give them from cluster three . - All right . - All right ? Hey , how much of a liability is Adam , anyway ? Not much . We 're all living on borrowed time , anyway . - Thanks . - Yeah . Hey , thank you . Thank you so much . Hey . I look unto the hills From where does my help come from ? My help comes from the Lord The maker of Heaven and Earth He will not let your foot be moved He will not ever slumber Behold us Israel He watches and never sleeps I look unto the hills From where does my help come from ? My help comes from the Lord The maker of Heaven and Earth I just want to thank all of you for coming out tonight for worship . I don 't know when our next meeting 's gonna be or where , but I 'll let you know . And I know there are fewer and fewer of us , but keep the faith - and stay hidden in Christ . - Amen . - Amen . - Yeah , amen . - Amen . - Hey , brother , that was great worship . - You sound awesome . - How you been doing ? Our Lord is gracious , isn 't he ? - Yeah . I suppose he is ... - Laura . Laura . It was good worshipping with you tonight . Good praise , sister . I just feel like his spirit moves so much when we worship like that , don 't you ? Yeah . I do . God bless you , brother . God bless you , brother . God bless you . - God bless you , brother . - Hey , brother . Thanks for coming . God bless you , brother . - God bless you , brother . - Amen , brother . Amen . Thanks . - So , you 're a physician ? - No , no . Doctor of divinity . Theologian . I knew another man like you . Changed my life . - Well , we 're glad to have you . - So , Adam , how did you survive prison ? It was tough . Hope 's hard to find in prison . But it 's there . Honestly , when I helped Jacob escape Global two years ago , I didn 't expect to end up on death row . Never did thank you for what you did for me , how you sacrificed yourself for my well-being . Seemed like the right thing to do at the time . So , what now ? The authorities will have me labelled as a murderer , and that means that everyone I come in contact with is in danger . You should sleep . We 'll talk more in the morning . May you be hidden in Christ tonight , brother . It 's been good to see you again , Jacob . It 's good to see you . - Good night . - Night . Adam , I 'll walk with you . Richard and I have drops in the morning . Gentlemen , it 's been a real pleasure . - Good night , Doc . - Good night . So , Adam , tell me a little bit more about this man who changed your life . Thank you for finding this one who was lost . I don 't think it was me who found him . I wonder what God 's plan is with all this . Expect the unexpected . Excuse me ? Nothing . Well , good night then . Carissa ? What ? Agent Riley . Gotcha . Hey . Hey , you . Glad you 're here . Me , too . So , where 's your husband ? He does Bible study with a few people nearly every night . It 's the only thing that keeps us all sane . Talk to me . Tell me what 's going on with you . Well , I 'm an escaped convict wanted for hate crimes and now murder . It 's been a good year . Humour . That 's good . I never thought my life would turn out like this . I didn 't expect you to be married . That happened last year . After all the disappearances , the Rapture , I quit the FBI . Can 't blame you for that . Richard and I met in a group studying the way . He 's really sweet . You were in prison . Carissa . I ... Where do you go from here ? I don 't know . I 'm a bit curious as to why Global isn 't all over us to find me . Remember that the Lord is in control . Everything that happens , he can turn to his glory . - Romans 8 : 28 . - 8 : 28 . - I just wish that ... - What ? I guess not everything in the world needs an explanation . You 're saying that . - What ? - You . Miss Science Major . I 'm much more relaxed after following the way of Christ . Why does everybody call it the way ? That 's what the Romans called it . You know the sign . The fish . We used to signal each other in prison and exchange pages of the Bible . That 's how Nick caught me . Red-handed . You think I should repent for stealing ? No . I think the Lord 's got you covered under the circumstances . Carissa , I 'm gonna be leaving in a few days . It 's been good to see you . Carissa , Richard was wondering where you ran off to . Just say goodbye before you leave . Good timing . Considering she is married to a very good friend of mine , I think so . Sometimes I don 't get God . Only sometimes ? There are days when I wonder if he is even there at all . You ? Doubt , it 's part of faith . It seems the Lord made it so that you can 't have one without the other . In prison , things were clear . I knew where I was going , and I knew what was gonna happen to me . I read the pages of the Bible that were smuggled to me , thanks to you . Thanks to Jesus . Thanks to Jesus . I just didn 't think I 'd be here . The Lord said to me , " Expect the unexpected . " It 's cryptic . Then you show up . He wants us to rely on him for everything . It 's hard . He never said we 'd be rich , only rich within him . Never said he 'd spare us trials . He said that the world would hate and kill us . He only promised us peace that passes all understanding and joy in our pain . Makes you wanna just run right out and become a believer , doesn 't it ? Yeah . Lord Jesus , you know our suffering and our pain . Be with us now . Strengthen our faith . Heal our hearts . Teach us your ways . Hide us in you . Amen . - Rex . Rex , wake up . - What ? Calm down . Calm down . Look , I got a job for you . - Now ? - That 's right . Right now . I need you to get a message to Global for me . How am I supposed to do that without getting caught ? - Don 't you have technical training , boy ? - Well , yes , sir , but Global ... - Listen to me , Rex . Listen to me , Rex . - ... shoot to kill . I want you to get them this note , all right ? We 're gonna tell them that we 're gonna deliver to them a religious extremist , and in exchange , they 'll leave those Bible thumpers ' supplies to us . Now remember , Rex , river wash at 0300 . - Yes , sir . - And , Rex , keep your head down , boy . All right . - We 'll give them what they want . - Yes , sir . - Some bright morning when this life is over - Some bright morning when this life is over - I 'll fly away - I 'll fly away - To a home on God 's celestial shore - To a home on God 's celestial shore - I 'll fly away - I 'll fly away - I 'll fly away , oh , glory - I 'll fly away , oh , glory - I 'll fly away - I 'll fly away - When I die , hallelujah , by and by - When I die , hallelujah , by and by - I 'll fly away - I 'll fly away - That 's right . - This guy here ? Yeah . - Hey , hey , hey ! - Brother . Brother . - Charles . - Hey . Nick . - Good to meet you . - Good to meet you . He 's got a cluster nearby . Actually , I have to drop off to a ranch first , but ... Look , I don 't get it . Why clusters ? - You know , like grapes . - You know , he 's the vine , we 're ... Okay . Caleb , look . Thanks a lot , all right ? You know , the desert 's a small place to me , so be hidden in Christ . Thank you . See you around . It appears they 're fully loaded , boys . And the remnant of Jacob shall be dragged off like sheep to the slaughter . - Yes , sir . - Amen . We 'll get them when they come around Desert Bend Road . Thy will be done . Here they come . Let 's roll . We got trouble , Doc . Put your seatbelt on . - They 're coming hard . - Be with us , God . Get him . They 're still coming . Oh , come on . Get around . Get around ! - They 're gaining on us . - I know , I know , I know , I know . We 'll cut here . Up here , boy , up here . Cut them off ! - Keep it between the ditches . - I know . I 'm trying , Doc . I 'm trying . Come on . Cut them off here . Cut them off here . Go , go , go . Get out of here . Go . Okay , that was too easy . Take the shot . Richard ! - What is it ? - I don 't know . Doesn 't look good . - That 's Doc 's old truck . - Let me see . Global . This is not good . - We should do something . - No , wait . Look , if Global believes there 's no use for him , they 'll let him go . If not , there 's nothing anyone could have done . Well , well , well . If isn 't Dr Marcus Brewer . Behold the 10 of clubs . Oh , really ? I was at least hoping for a face card . It seems like you and your little friends have been busy . We tracked your movements , but you 're running out of places to hide . - The Lord protects us . - Really ? Your God 's dead . I have a Global person among you that could prove that point to you . - God gives power to whom he chooses . - Well , that 's good to know . Then I can delay you legally with your dead God 's permission . Why don 't you just leave us alone ? We 're not bothering anybody . You might have contraband . You might have weapons . You could be hiding fugitives from the law . Man 's law or God 's law ? Aren 't you supposed to turn the other cheek ? God is not mocked . You seem to be having problems . You seem to be losing things , don 't you , Colonel Fredericks ? I will crush you , you and your little clusters . We will find you all . Now , give me the location , Doctor . " I look to the hills . From where does my help come from ? " My help comes from the Lord ... " - If they follow the way , I will find them . - " ... the maker of Heaven and Earth . " He will not let thy foot be moved ... " - Jacob Krause . I will find him . - " ... nor will he ever slumber . " - Adam Riley . - " The Lord is my shepherd . " - I 'll find him , too . - " I shall not want . " They will all be brought to justice ... " He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . " - ... for their crimes against Global Alliance . - " He leads beside still waters . - " He restores my soul . " - Stop it ! " He leads me down the path of righteousness for his name 's sake . " Yea , do I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ... " - Then die . - " ... I shall fear no ... " They shot him . They just shot him . Why ? Why did they shoot ? - Why did they shoot him ? - Okay , no , no , no . Listen , listen . - Listen . All right . Listen , we can 't fight them . - They shot him . - Yes , we can . - No , we can 't . Just let him go . Let him go . Colonel , what do you want to do with him ? Let him rot . We need some help here , people ! Help me ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Richard 's been shot . Grab him . Grab him . Be careful ! Be careful ! Take his things . Let 's go , we need supplies , guys . I 'll go get some bandages . - Adam , Adam , Adam . - I should have guessed . Wherever there 's tragedy , the government 's not too far behind . - No . No , no , no . It 's not what you think . - Then explain it to me . - Well , Nick was bringing me here . - And you just happened to run into trouble ? - That 's convenient , isn 't it ? - No , Adam ... Maybe ... Hey , hey , come on . Enough ! That 's enough . We 've had enough violence for today . You let him in your camp . Now you deal with it . Welcome back . - Be right back , sweetheart . - All right . I don 't know how bad it is . He 's lost a lot of blood . - Hey , buddy . - Hey . You don 't look so bad . Hey , I 'm thirsty . Thanks . Richard , what happened out there ? We were being followed by the militia , and we ran into Global Patrol roadblocks . And then they fired . No warning , nothing . Maybe they 're changing their tactics . Hey , the commander said that we might have a spy among us . Are you sure ? Yes . But he didn 't say who . - You okay ? - Yeah . Look , I just ... I just wanna say that I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Thank you . " These things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace . " In the world ye shall have tribulation , but be of good cheer . " I have overcome the world . " Shall I pray ? Lord Jesus , we ask you for the miracle of healing , not just of the body , but of the mind and of the spirit . Teach us to be more like you , to forgive and to be forgiven . Please . Please . Please , take care of her . Please . No . Richard , come on . No , no , no . No , Richard . Richard . No , no , no , no . Richard . Wake up , Richard . Richard . It 's a hot one today . The weather . How original . What do you want me to say ? I don 't know . After the day we 're having , maybe " I 'm sorry " would be a good start ? " I 'm sorry " ? You betrayed me . - I betrayed you ? - Yeah . What about me ? You knew where I was . Is that what this is about ? Because I didn 't come visit ? We were FBI agents . You let a prisoner go . You and your ridiculous stunts messed up my entire life . I freed a man who has done more good in this world than you and I combined , and I went to prison ! They pinned a commendation on me . It made me sick . So I resigned . How did you find me ? - You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . - Try me . It 's complex . It 's hard to trust someone I know is Global . - Is that what you think ? That I 'm a spy ? - Prove you 're not . I can 't . You have to trust me . I trusted you once . I 'm running a little low on trust today . Then I 'm sorry . The sun 's going down . I have a few hours . Don 't let the sun go down on your anger . You should forgive . I have , 100 times . Then bless him . What ? If you 've really forgiven , you can bless him . Why would I want God to do that ? Adam , you don 't forgive with your head . You forgive with your heart , with your spirit . Just like Jesus did to the men that crucified him . That 's easy for you . Exactly where did the easy part come in ? I don 't recall forgiveness ever being easy . Charles could have led Global right to Doc and Richard . And maybe he didn 't . You don 't know what happened out there . Don 't judge unless you wanna be judged the same way . Don 't quote scripture to me ! These people , your friends , were slaughtered ! - " An eye for an eye . " That 's scripture , too . - You 're quoting out of context . - How can you forgive that ? - By faith ! " Our struggle is not against flesh and blood . " It is against the powers and the principalities of this dark world . " I can 't fight that on my own . The spirit of God in me has to do it . They put me in a cell to rot for two years . I was beaten and tortured . They tried to make me deny the God that I had accepted hours before they put me in there . And now he brings me out here . For what ? To teach you ! Being in prison should have showed you that evil has personality . His name is Satan , the great accuser , and we fight him with spiritual weapons , with prayer , with the word of God . This is unseen , but it is very real , Adam . I saw no principalities of power in prison . Just flesh and blood , Jacob . I know what is good and what is evil , and those men who killed your friends are evil . Don 't you take that attitude ! Don 't you take that attitude with me ! Are you telling me that Jesus is a liar ? Are you telling me that Jesus is sadistic ? Are you telling me that Jesus is playing games ? Are you telling Jesus the same thing that Adam did in the garden ? " I am the one who can judge what is good and evil and not you ! " - Jacob , settle down . - I am entitled to my emotions ! I can have them ! Don 't you leave ! You stand with me ! Lord Jesus , I have the right to be angry and hate the men who killed my best friends ! I want them to pay for what they did ! I want them to suffer ! I want them to die ! I want them to die ! Kill them ! Kill them all , Jesus ! Kill them . But I choose , by faith , to give up my right to revenge and turn them over to you , Christ Jesus , for him to judge . Your will , not mine . Jesus , forgive me . Help me to forgive . You all right ? I may have to do this again tomorrow . Looks as if we 're up and running in the surveillance area , sir . The satellite tracking system upgrade should prevent any interference with the solar flares this time . B chip triangulation and heat-seeking ? Only the biological encoding chip , sir . Our heat-seeking choppers are grounded due to weather . When are we capable ? The weather system should be moving out in about 48 hours , sir . It 's too bad we can 't see who they are . But we will soon enough , Sergeant , soon enough . - Keep tracking . Inform me of any change . - Yes , sir . Knowing that both Doc and Richard are where they 've longed to be , in your presence , Father , we release your humble servants into your care . We know that you have said to them when they arrive , " Well done , good and faithful servant . " Amen . I know this is not the time or the place , but it 's the reality of our situation . Now these graves will mark where we 've been . We need to move on for our own safety . Nick , gather the men . Naomi , you work with Carissa and scatter the camp . Go by different routes . We 'll meet at old Calloway ranch . There 's a barn there . It should keep us safe . I 'll go get some food . Charles . I need a partner , someone who could be a good student , someone with an open heart . This is your invitation . I don 't know what to say . - Promise me you 'll pray about it . - I 'll pray . Well , excuse me . I need to pack . That was a surreal moment . Yeah . Yeah , it was . The sheep are changing pasture . Any stragglers ? Negative . They 've all scattered north . Pasture in Calloway . The mother lode , brethren . The mother lode . They 're heading north to Calloway ranch , sir . We flushed them out . Keep monitoring . The last few days have made me think about a lot of things , who I am , what I want . - I 'm asking for your forgiveness , Charles . - You 're forgiven . Good . Good . You know , Adam , it was never my intention to turn you in . - It was just the circumstance , I ... - I forgive you , Charles . I mean it this time . I want what you have . You know , I 've had a good job , material things , I 've travelled the world , but I 'm restless . I want what these people have . I said that once myself . I lived my life the way I thought was right , but I 'm burned out . - My wife 's in Global custody and ... - What ? She 's where ? She 's in Global custody , and there 's nothing I can do about it . I have to live with ... What are you doing ? Adam ! Adam , what are you doing ? What is this ? Were you gonna blow the whistle on the whole group or just me ? - What is this ? What is this ? - Forgive me ? You 're a piece of work , you know that ? Did they blackmail you or did you volunteer for this job ? I know nothing about this . I have no idea what you 're ... Leave , or I 'll kill you myself ! - Where 's Jacob ? - He 's in the barn . What 's wrong ? Jacob . You 're so trusting of Charles , who doesn 't deserve it . What is that ? - It 's a bug ? - A tracking device . It 's very sophisticated . I could 've contacted Global any time with this . - My husband died because of you ? - I didn 't know . - Maybe you should leave . - I didn 't know . I didn 't know ! - You 're just letting him go ? - What do you want me to do ? Shoot him ? This changes everything , Jacob . I am his messenger . I will not be afraid . I am his messenger . I will not be afraid . God helps them that help themselves . Amen . Amen . Like lambs to slaughter , Lord . Lieutenant Robert Jackson . You 're AWOL . Vengeance is mine . - That 's automatic gunfire . - We should move out . - There may be wounded down there . - Trust me . If it 's Global , they 're dead . Carissa , take all the women out of here . Go to the other side of the hill . We 'll meet you there . Can you get that stuff over there ? Don 't do anything you 'll regret . Lord be with you . - Adam , please , don 't go . - Grab those blankets , please . Let 's go . I have to . Hurry up , you guys ! Come on . We gotta get out of here . Come on . Let 's go , come on . Everybody follow me . We 're heading to cluster four . Two-for-one night . Militia , just a bonus . What do you want to do with the bodies , Colonel ? Burn them with the barn . The religious extremists are still close . They 're on foot , two , three klicks . - Find them . - Yes , sir . - And , sergeant . - Sir ? Remember , Riley killed two of our own . Yes , sir . Lock and load . Let 's go ! You two take the left flank , you guys take the centre , I 'll take the right flank . Let 's move out . He 's coming your way . - Carissa ? - Coming . - Agent Riley . - Former Agent Riley . I was asked to resign . Or didn 't you hear ? What are you here for ? You wanna get captured ? You wanna get put to death like you deserve ? I 'm here to stop you . And how do you propose to do that ? Pray me to death ? - Good . - How do you live with yourself ? It 's easy . I enjoy what I do . Getting up in the morning , going to work , doing good for the world . Get up . Your God is a myth . Your faith , it 's a joke . And you , you 're nothing . You 're a cockroach , and I ... And I am the exterminator . You people . I round you up , I crush you with my heel . What kind of God allows his people to die like that ? Funny thing about cockroaches , they 've been around since God created the world , and no matter what you do , you just can 't seem to get rid of them . You crush one and suddenly there 's two more ! You 're less than a cockroach . I 'll wipe you and every one of your kind that serves your God off the face of this earth . Flesh and blood . Spirit . What 's the matter , Agent Riley ? Giving up already ? I was just getting started . " Our struggle is not against flesh and blood , " but against the powers and forces " of this dark world . " Pity to kill you so soon . " To live is Christ . To die is gain . " - Get up ! - " The Lord is my strength ... " I said get up ! - " ... and my salvation . Whom shall I fear ? " - Get up ! - " If someone strikes you on the cheek ... " - Shut up ! " ... turn the other one also to him . " - " For God so loved the world ... " - Hate me ! - " ... that he gave his only begotten Son ... " - I want you to hate me ! " ... that whosoever believeth in him ... " - Everything ... - " ... should not perish ... " - ... everyone you care about , I will kill ... - " ... but have everlasting life . " ... and destroy . There are worse things than dying . Then get ready to die , you sorry cockroach . Agent Baker , so glad you could join us . Say goodbye to your old friend . I don 't think so . I have your wife in custody . You were never gonna release her . She follows the way , the truth and the life , and for that matter , so do I. - Charles , if you truly believe , you won 't fire . - What are you doing here ? I got worried . Charles , those who live by the sword , they die by the sword . Taking this man 's life will solve nothing . Maybe not . But it 'll sure make me feel better . - No , it won 't . - Tyranny , evil , death , they should be destroyed ! - Charles ... - They slaughtered your friends , and they have my wife ! " Vengeance is the Lord 's . " Charles , his sins , his sins are between him and God . " Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you , " bless those who curse you . " Charles , this may be the hardest thing you 've ever had to do , but you 've gotta let go of your hate . Let go . Let go . Look out ! No ! You 're all fools . Where 's your God now ? " An eye for an eye , " brother . Hey , brother . Let 's go get that shoulder looked at . You can say that again . All right , there 's time for family reunions later . We gotta get out of here . - Good to see you . - Smells like rain . - Always with the weather . - We could use a little rain . Yeah , about 40 days of it . Yeah . But then we 'd have to build a boat .

 Tony ! Sorry . Get a move on , Tony ! I can 't find it ! Who 's there ? Tony ? Stu ? Finney ? Is that you ? 'Hi Luke , how are you ? 'How 's everything back home ? It seems like only yesterday I was saying ... 'goodbye , but time flies when you 're having fun . I miss you all so much ! ' There are worse things than aliens . These children going missing , it 's terrible . How is she ? Does she like Washington ? She says it 's awesome . It sounds like Maria 's going to fit in perfectly . Sounds like it . Luke , I know it 's hard when a really good friend , someone you really care about , moves out of your life . But you 'll see Maria again . Well , she 's coming back for her mum 's wedding , isn 't she ? I 'm sure we 'll all meet up then . It won 't be the same . Maybe not , but , you know , that 's not always so bad . One of the best things about life is it 's always surprising us . Morning people . This is Clyde Langer reporting live from Bannerman Road where , at this precise moment there 's a new family moving in at number 36 . Boy , they have no idea what they 're moving in over the road from ! No , and they 're never going to find out , do you hear ? Both of you . Promise me you 'll never breathe a word about what we do , Mr Smith , any of it . Why would we ? It 's not like it 's Maria , is it ? Come on , we 're going to be late . Yeah , sure . Don 't worry , we won 't say anything . We 'd better hope Maria never left anything lying around when she went . What do you mean ? Well , you know , we 've been hanging with some pretty random intergalactic sorts . Who knows what might have rubbed off and still be over there ? I did not fancy Maria . Boy , I taught you well , didn 't I ? Clyde 's Cool Rule Number Two , deny all emotion , especially when involving girls . I just miss her , OK ? Don 't you ? Course I miss her . But people move on , Luke . Ask my mum and dad . I 've never lost anyone before . Well , it 's not going to be the same without her , that 's for sure . I mean , who am I going to have to save from Sontarans , the Slitheen and Gorgons now ? Hey ! Watch where you 're ... Don 't ... don 't mention it . It 's no problem . Sorry . I 'm looking for Mr Cunningham 's form . That 's our class . I start today . And you run into me . Now that 's what I call a start ! Yeah . Like starting the 100m in the Olympics and tripping over your laces . This is Clyde . He thinks he 's cool . I 'm Luke . Who isn 't . Rani . My family just moved in to Bannerman Road . Bannerman Road ? Of course . Where else ? Sarah Jane 's right , the universe never stops weirding you out . Sarah who ? Never mind . Come on , I 'll take you to class . Did you just see that ? See what ? Never mind . Come on , I 'd better not be late . So the football team has been knocked out of the Inter-Schools Challenge , by West Hill after a 4-0 mauling last night . ALL : Boooooo ! Yeah , all right , settle down , settle down . So we 'll be looking for better news in the National Schools Science Challenge . Anybody who wants to sign up for the team should see Miss Webster . I 'll be expecting to see your name on the list , Luke . Lukey ! Lukey ! Lukey ! You a bit of a brain-box then , Luke ? They haven 't got a box big enough . That 's enough ! Silence , the lot of you . This is a classroom , not the home end at Stamford Bridge ! Class , this is Mr Chandra , our new Head . This is a school , my school . And you come here to learn , not to play about . You , boy ! Sit up straight and pay attention ! And that goes for all of you ! I know it 's been a while since your last head teacher , Mr Blakeman , disappeared , and it looks like standards around here vanished with him . But , listen up , Park Vale has a new captain on the bridge , now . I 'm getting a very serious sinking feeling . I 'm a fair captain but , believe me , I run a very tight ship . Aye aye , Skipper . Ah , the joker in the pack . I do my best . Well , Clyde Langer , I hope your classwork is as sharp as your wit . It takes brains to be this funny . No , Langer . It takes brains to know when to shut up and listen ! Now , a third child has gone missing . I 'm speaking to all classes today , reminding you all to be careful , and just as importantly , telling you all that if you see anything or anyone suspicious , to tell the police immediately . Yes ? Hello ? Hello . I live over the road . I saw you were moving in . Thought maybe you hadn 't had time to find the kettle yet . Oh , tell me , do you save the world every day , or is it just on Mondays ? Come on in , come in . Sorry it 's such a state . I had a plan ... a list , you know , what was what and where it was going . But then you have to go and use removal men , don 't you ? And frankly my darling , you might as well give in to chaos . Ooh , I 'm Gita by the way . Sarah Jane . Well , I 'm very pleased to meet you , Sarah . Jane . Lovely . Shall I see if I can find some cups ? Perfect . So , that 's your house , is it ? The big one right opposite ? Yes . Do you have kids , Sarah ? Sarah Jane . All clear . Sorry ? Oh , just my son , Luke . There 's just the two of us . Aaah . We 've got a girl . Rani . She 's very clever . So what were the last people like that lived in our house ? Mr Jackson and his daughter ? Nice . I miss Maria . Oh , yeah ? I mean , we were friends . Maria , Clyde and me . We can be friends . Yeah . But it wouldn 't be the same . Oh . Sorry I suggested it . No , I didn 't mean it like that . I can 't explain . Inter-personal relationships is something I haven 't mastered yet . You know , I hope you don 't mind me telling you , but you do know you 're a bit weird , don 't you ? I mean , I think you 're all right . Just a bit strange . I 'm not strange , I 'm just different . There 's a difference . Yeah . I suppose . These kids going missing , though , that is weird . Three in two weeks . And the police just don 't have a clue . Don 't worry , statistically the chances of you being abducted are extremely remote . I 'm not worried . I 'm interested , that 's all . It 's weird . I 'm into weird . Have you ever seen anything strange ? I mean around the school ? Like what ? Langer ! My office , now ! So what do you do for a living , Sarah ? I 'm a freelance journalist . A journalist ? My Rani wants to be a journalist . What a coincidence . Perhaps she should come round ? You could give her some tips . Well , my work tends to be rather specialised . And I 'm very busy . In fact , I really should be getting on now . She 'll be so excited . And she and your Luke are bound to be friends . Oh , you 'll love her . She 's very curious , wants to know everything about everybody . Does she ? Oh , good . He still got you here ? But it was an accident . Yeah , well we didn 't exactly hit it off from the start . I think Mr Chandra 's jealous of my popularity . Your trouble is you don 't know when to lay off . Yeah ? Being funny is a curse . It 's like me and the Wolfman ... Life 's just one big shaggy dog story . I need some stuff for art club . Dave ? Finney , are you in there ? Finney , are you messing me around ? What are you ? All I want to do is give you a balloon . Langer ! I 've been looking for you . Why aren 't you outside my office ? A clown ? That 's what I saw . Look , if I 'm making this up , tell me , where is Finney ... I mean Dave ? He 's been kidnapped by a clown from the stationery cupboard . Langer , I don 't know what sort of game you 're playing , but this is not the way to make an impression on me . Yeah , I should 've kept my mouth shut . Children are disappearing and you think that 's something to joke about ? But you said , you told us , if we see anything suspicious to sing out . Well , I am . Look , I tell jokes , not lies sir . David Finn has probably just bunked off school early . He wouldn 't . Ask anyone . So how come no-one else has seen this clown ? Not even our CCTV cameras ? Oh , what 's the use ? I knew I was wasting my time even talking to you . You 're never going to believe me . It 's a good thing there 's someone else who will . So you think we should tell Mum ? What do you think ? Mr Chandra 's called the police , but they 're not exactly going to be looking for a clown that comes at you out of a mirror , are they ? You didn 't tell him that part , did you ? What am I ? Mr Thicko from Thicksville ? Course I didn 't . But we know aliens have nabbed kids before . Do you remember Kudlak ? Yes . Aliens . That was a clown . Why would an alien be dressed as a clown ? So you don 't believe me , either . Thanks a lot , mate . I do believe you . I just don 't understand . Well , there 's a first . There it is ! Where ? Oh , come on ! He 's there ... Come on ! Where is he ? Search me . But he was here . Look . Don 't touch it ! Why ? I don 't know why , just don 't . But you didn 't tell anyone ? What am I supposed to say ? 'Look Mum and Dad , I don 't want to worry you , but I 'm seeing clowns ... 'that no-one else can see ' ? Why not ? Do you want them to get me locked up ? Why would they do that ? What planet is he from ? Oh , Earth . Mostly . Yeah . You 're so funny , Clyde . No wonder ... the head teacher loves you . Look , Rani , whatever this clown thing is , I think we should leave it to the police , don 't you ? They don 't even believe it exists . You know that . He 's right . It 's nothing to do with us . There 's something happening here that doesn 't make everyday sense . Maybe you can ignore it because it doesn 't go with your MP3 player or your designer trainers , but I can 't . I 've got to know what 's going on . Sarah Jane 's going to love this one . Look , there 's something I 've got to tell you . Something about me you ought to know . You 're from another planet . I already guessed . Actually , Clyde , it 's worse than that ... Oh , no . Rani , please tell me there 's a good reason why our new head just pulled up outside your house that doesn 't involve the word ' dad ' . He 's all right , really . It 's just his job . Yeah , that 's what they said about Dr Frankenstein . Rani . Hi , Dad . Haresh ! Don 't worry , there 's still plenty of boxes for you to open . Rani , how was your first day at school ? Did your dad go all Captain Bligh again ? I do not go Captain Bligh . Yeah , just a bit . This is Luke and Clyde . Luke Smith . Pleased to meet you . Luke Smith ? He 's my son . I 'm Sarah Jane Smith . I 've been looking at his results for the past year . Very , very impressive . Remarkable , in fact . Yes , well , he 's very gifted . Sarah 's a journalist . For real ? I 'm really interested in becoming a reporter . Maybe I can come over some time ? Oh , well , I really am rather busy . Clyde Langer , the joker in the pack , apparently . Oh , and I see clowns that don 't exist . Of course your head teacher was never going to believe you . Nor would the police . Children don 't vanish out of closed rooms . It 's impossible as far as they are concerned . But what about the clown ? If it 's an alien taking these kids , a clown disguise isn 't exactly low-profile , is it ? But it might know that kids are supposed to like clowns . Personally , they always gave me nightmares . Coulrophobia . It 's the fear of clowns . Johnny Depp has it . What encyclopaedia did you find that in ? Heat . Now we need to talk to someone close to the boy that went missing today . His parents will be too busy with the police by now . What about any of his other friends ? It 's Monday . So they 'll be at football training . What about Rani ? She 's seen the clown too . I don 't want her involved . But she seemed determined to find out what 's going on . And she might be in danger . You 're right . Someone should keep an eye on her . Yeah , yeah , I 'll do that . I don 't think her dad would let you go anywhere near her . So , it looks as if the boy disappeared like the others . His poor parents , must be going out of their minds . Makes me ill , just thinking about it . You watch yourself , won 't you , Rani ? She 'll be fine , as long as she stays away from that Langer boy . David Finn is one of Clyde 's best friends , Dad . He wasn 't making it up . Clyde saw a clown . Why would he lie ? I don 't know . But a clown , it 's ridiculous . I was thinking the police should take a look at Finn 's school books . There 's still a chance that something was worrying him and he ran away . If so , there may be a clue there . Before that , you can help me move the bed . Those removal men didn 't listen to a word I said . And they got out alive ? Come on , I 'll show you . No . You 're not there . Rani , you 've got a visitor . Thought you might need a hand unpacking . My dad says journalists are scum . They 're like crows picking at road-kill . Well , I guess he only buys a newspaper to look at the pictures then . Oh , come on , Steve . Sarah Jane 's trying to help find Finney . I don 't know anything . Had he been acting strangely recently ? No , not that I saw . What about clowns ? Did he ever say anything about clowns ? No ! Hang on . 'There was this clown ... 'handing out tickets by the station . ' Take a hike , Krusty ! So Tony Warner , the boy that went missing in the park , he took a ticket as well ? Yeah . But they were just tickets from a clown . It doesn 't mean anything , does it ? What were the tickets for ? Just a minute . I 'd forgotten all about this . My mum picked it up for me at the shops . Spellman 's Magical Museum of the Circus . Like ... like I 'd want to go . It was in the kitchen , Luke . It 's getting closer to me . Don 't worry , it 's gone now . There 's more . Look at this . Dad 's taking Finney 's books to the police . They 're looking for clues , but I don 't think they 'll be looking for size 20 footprints . If they do take this seriously , there might not be anything they can do . You see ! This isn 't natural . None of it . It 's ... it 's supernatural ! I doubt it 's supernatural . You 've got such a closed mind ! The supernatural is only science we don 't know yet , like life on other planets . That 's different . I 've got to do something . Look at those pictures . Finney was seeing the clown the same as I am . Spellman 's Magical Museum of the Circus ? People were handing these out by the Tube . I think you should talk to my mum . I can 't talk to anyone , Luke . Don 't you get it ? You haven 't seen the clown . I think only kids that get one of these can see it . Then they disappear ! Clyde saw it . Then he must have a ticket . Believe me , Mum understands things like this . Luke , whatever 's going on here , no-one understands things like this . But this ticket , it 's got to be a clue . You coming ? Welcome to the Circus of Horrors . You know , Clyde , occasionally your sense of humour really leaves something to be desired . Who said I was joking ? Are you all right ? Clowns make my skin crawl . Come on . Like , museums don 't normally creep me out . All those stuffed animals , old bones and mummies . But this place doesn 't just take the biscuit , this place gets the whole Christmas tin . Welcome , welcome to Spellman 's Magical Museum of the Circus and the story of the most wondrous family entertainment in the world . From the tumblers and jugglers of Ancient Rome to the father of the modern circus , believe it or not , a Sergeant Major in the 15th Light Dragoons . Mr Spellman , I presume . Elijah Spellman at your service . My name is Sarah Jane Smith . I 'm a journalist . This is my friend , Clyde . We 're here to talk to you about clowns . Ah , the princes of the sawdust ring ! This way , please . Mankind has always needed someone to make them laugh , slave or king . Can you do me a favour and drop a note to my head teacher ? The Pharaohs had fools , so did the Native Americans . We had harlequins , and , in the Middle Ages , the jester . It 's not so much the clown 's showbiz history that I 'm interested in , as their reputation for scaring people . The fear of the painted smile . It 's not as simple as that , Mr Spellman . They used to paint clowns on the walls of children 's wards , but when they were asked , every child said the pictures scared them . Children sense things . I know . Come on ! I really don 't think we should be doing this . OK . We won 't . I 'll go in on my own . Sarah Jane , look at this . These are the same colours as the clown I saw . Red , yellow and blue . This isn 't a clown . This is the Pied Piper . The story goes he rid Hamelin of its plague of rats , then when the town refused to pay him he came back and took all their children . The oldest , and most accurate picture of the Pied Piper . The colours of his costume signify he was a travelling entertainer . But , I 'm afraid , even clowns have their dark days . And that 's exactly the sort of clown I 'm interested in , Mr Spellman . One that makes children disappear . But the Pied Piper was a fairy tale . Myths , legends , fairy tales ... Every story has its inspiration , Clyde . Mr Spellman ? Where did he go ? I don 't know , but something tells me we should get out of here , too . Quickly , come on ! Luke ? Mum ? What are you doing here ? What are WE doing here ? ! What are YOU doing here ? You told me to stay with her . Am I missing something ? Yeah , and keep her out of the action . What action ? What 's happening ? They 're moving ! Something 's animating the clowns . Look out , all of you . They 're alive ! Run ! What happened to Spellman ? He 's controlling them . I think they 're like puppets , probably under telekinetic control . Walking puppets ? Telekinetic control ? He 's controlling them with his mind . I know what it means , Luke . Who 's Spellman ? Probably ... an alien . Stand back . What was that ? Sonic lipstick . Never leave home without it . I 've seized up their joints . Should hold them up while we get out of here . Aliens . Luke said aliens . Actually , he said alien . And it will still be around here somewhere . Come on . There 's no time for explanations . She 's right . And from what I 've seen , one alien can be as much trouble as a whole invasion . Come on . He 's sealed the doors . Telekinesis . The same way he animated the clown mannequins . Whatever we 're dealing with here , it is extremely powerful . What did I tell you ? And it 's got us trapped ! No , Rani . It just thinks it has . Oh , no , Miss Smith . I 'm convinced of it . Are you really an alien ? Stay back , Rani . Leave this to me . Who are you ? And what do you want ? Who am I ? I am the Pied Piper , who conjured away a whole town 's infants , and has chilled the hearts of parents for more than seven centuries . And now I am Odd Bob the Clown , who snatches children in the heartbeat their mother 's back is turned . I am the thing that lives in the darkest corners . I am all these things and more . I am all that you fear the most . And you are mine to feed on ! Mum , you have to tell her everything . I want to know the truth . This is a Vorgatt defence field emitter . Morning . I 'm going to find out what you are , Odd Bob . We 're only scared of what we don 't understand . I will chill the blood of a nation . And millions will shudder , sleepless with a bone gnawing ... fear . Help me ! Luke !

 Walter , what are you doing ? I 'm dosing a caterpillar . Dosing , as in LSD ? Well , it 's a special blend . I see . - Hey , guess what just happened . - Hmm ? Finding out that my father 's giving drugs to bugs ... Somehow just became a typical moment in my life . It 's wonderful , isn 't it ? Hey , have you heard from Olivia this morning ? No , why ? What 's up ? She 's missing . Who are you ? What do you want ? This won 't take long . I 'm sure you say that to all the girls . Turn her over . Listen up ! One of our own has been abducted . The vehicle of Agent Olivia Dunham was found abandoned on Graniteville Road in Westford three miles northeast of Little Hill . I want everyone doing everything , surveillance cameras checked , local officers and agents questioned , anyone who might have seen anything . P.D. , D.W.P , A.W.A - I don 't care what acronym it is . You get ' em , you talk to ' em , and you find Dunham . For those of you new to this office , this is Agent Charlie Francis . He 's my second in command . You got anything , you come to me or him . Try not to move . Sir , did it work ? I hope so . Get my car ready . I 'm going back to the office . Yes , sir . Can I please have some water ? If you 're going to kill me , Then can I please have some water ? Please . I need to ... I need to sit up . Please . Oh , thank you , thank you . Thank you . And pull agents from Albany , Mr. Clark , and get them to Boston , or do I need to remind you how I started this conversation ? I have a Sanford Harris , line six . Just get it done . Sanford . Listen , we , uh ... We 're having something of a crisis here . Yeah , well , your crisis is why I 'm calling . Look , Phillip , we go back too far . I say something diplomatic , you 'll see through it Before the end of my sentence . You 're calling about Olivia Dunham ? I 'm calling about Fringe division . Internal affairs is sending me in to do a full review of your office , make sure things are running as they should . I just wanted you to hear it from me . This is Agent Dunham . I need to speak to Broyles . What the hell happened to you ? I 'm in Watertown . There was a building that we need to raid . I need agents , maybe 20 . Have them meet me in 30 minutes at the end of Talcott Street . Are you okay ? Not yet , I 'm not . The building I was being held at is two miles ... Hands behind your head and drop to the floor ! - Where 's Broyles ? - Do it ! What 's going on here ? Freeze right there ! Quite a day , Agent Dunham . You 're in Boston Hospital . You probably didn 't think you 'd see me again so soon . Don 't take this the wrong way , Mr. Harris , but , uh , I don 't think about you all too often . Really ? Well , you must get some satisfaction from what you did to me . My conviction wasn 't a point of pride for you ? Why am I cuffed to the bed ? Because this is the kind of authority that I have here . You see , My conviction ... on sexual assault that you so ably prosecuted was overturned . And Homeland Security , for whom I consult , has assigned me to review Fringe division . Just like that ? Which gives me the prerogative to question your sanity , your loyalty , your worthiness to serve . And it seems to me the people you surround yourself with have failed those tests at every turn . Beginning with your former partner ... And lover , John Scott . John ! An agent who betrayed you and who turned out to be a traitor against this country , A traitor whose life you went to considerable lengths to save . If you 're suggesting that I know anything about - You went to Iraq to recruit a man to help you save Agent Scott 's life . Peter Bishop , arrested seven times . I needed Peter . To assist you in freeing his father from a mental institution . Walter Bishop , who was sent to St. Claire 's because he was deemed unfit to stand trial for manslaughter , A man who spent most of his adult years running questionable scientific experiments on human subjects . He 's out of his mind , Miss Dunham . These are the people you surround yourself with . A traitor , a criminal , and a lunatic . What does that say about you ? Am I under arrest ? It goes without saying that you are not to investigate your own abduction . Understood ? Liv . Are you okay ? Yep . Hey , Liv , you know I had nothing to do with the way you were taken in . Right ? Yeah , I know that . That son of a bitch Harris , he molested three women . I put him away , and that 's what this is about . I am not gonna ask him for a thing . I 'm gonna go to that building myself . We sent a team to the address , to the building where you were being held . It was empty . There was nothing there . What about the phone I got ? The car I took ? Did you trace - They 're clean . The only prints were yours . Oh , there 's something else . There 's a woman here to see you , Rachel . She says that you 're expecting her . Who is she ? She 's my sister . How are you ? Oh , oh , you look great . - I don 't really . - Come on , you do . I don 't . You 're always so hard on yourself . - I know , whatever . Thank you . - You look good . You are just a giant person . - Hey , Aunt Olivia . - Hello . When did you get so big ? What happened to your face ? Oh , it 's , um , a scratch . I brought this for you . She wanted to bring you something from her room . I have really , really needed one of these . Thank you so much . Are you sure you 're alright ? It 's a long story . I , uh ... I 'm working on a case . Go , go , we 're good . Is it okay if we still stay with you tonight ? - ' Cause if it 's not okay ... - Yeah , yeah . No , of course . I 'll meet you back here at 5 : 00 . Perfect . Go , save the world . - All right . - I love you . - I 'll see you at 5 : 00 . - Thank you so much . Mwah ! Bye . Hello ? Peter , it 's me . Olivia , thank God ! Are you okay ? How are you ? - Where are you ? - I 'm on my way to you . So can you meet me outside in ten minutes ? And bring your father . I think we 'll need him . Do I have to ? They ... they gave me a spinal tap . They put electrodes or sensors on my head . Why would they do that ? I mean , what would they want with me ? What were they doing ? Who could they be ? You 're like the question machine . And there was nothing there when they checked the building ? No . They 'd cleared the building . But I took something before I left , something from one of their labs , and I hid it to keep it safe . What was it ? Walter , can you identify what it is ? Yes . I 'm afraid I can . Which means if your high school bio teacher told you that humans sit at the top of the food chain , he or she was dead wrong . Literally millions and millions of organisms feed on us , reproduce within us . Viruses , bacteria , protozoa , and fungi ... the four musketeers of the pathogenic world . Dr. Kinberg ? Dr. Kinberg ? Somebody call an ambulance . Someone help him . Somebody help him . Edited by : VeRdiKT " Bound " Agent Dunham , I know you 've already had quite a day . But there is an event that requires our attention . Okay , where ? Internal haemorrhaging . Rapid cell deterioration . It appears that he suffocated from within . Well , maybe that 's 'cause a giant , slimy , spiky slug came out of his mouth . Yes . And I have a theory as to what it might have been . I 'm sure you do . Care to share ? Eventually . Peter , anything ? No , it always takes a second for the thermal cameras to calibrate . What do we know about our guy ? Only what I was told outside . His name 's Miles Kinberg , immunologist , cutting edge work , an expert in his field . That 's all I know . Whatever it was , it ripped through his oesophagus on the way out . At least he died teaching , a righteous profession . Hold on a sec . I got it . Stay there . Right there . Right there , right there . Look . - Simian haemorrhagic fever . - Right under the chair . The infected cells have a definitive spiderweb look . Makes HIV look like a common cold by comparison . Walter ! Ebola . First the headaches then the skin turns to rice pudding . Walter , please . No time for the immune response . I lost it . What do you mean you lost it ? Either it can vanish or it 's fast . It 's really fast . There . Cover the doors ! It 's going down . There ! Get it ! There ! There ! Get it , get it . Get it . Things like this used to happen in the lab all the time . Makes me nostalgic . Spirited , isn 't it ? Well , have you considered , I don 't know , killing it ? We can always kill it , son . We can 't always bring it back . You probably could . That is true . Do you know what I could go for ? Don 't say food . Cheese steak . How can he even think about eating ? I know . It 's disgusting , right ? And yet ... - Ha , you want one too ? - Extra provolone , please . Like father , like son . Oh , come on , don 't say that . My theory is correct . I knew it . This organism was developed from the same material that Olivia stole from her captors . We must let her know . - You sure ? - My boy , I 'm not even sure that we all exist on the same plane of consciousness . But yes , I believe so . I 've been briefed of how you brought in Olivia Dunham . Oh , I had reason to suspect she might be dangerous . I agreed to let you question her , not tranq her like a rabid dog . What you did was unacceptable . Dunham 's been nothing but an exemplary agent , and this is my office . Well , then you need to be corrected on two counts . The jury 's out on Dunham . I 'm not convinced she 's the superstar you claim she is . How could you be ? You 're on a vendetta against her . Secondly , while I 'm here on active investigation , this division is under my purview . Active investigation ? This morning it was a review . Well , the Pentagon is concerned , Phillip . Well , think of how this office was thrown together . Flight 627 lands , and suddenly you 're in charge of two dozen agents ? Somehow I think none of that 's the reason you 're here . This isn 't a witch hunt . I - I 'm not here to punish some J.V agent who tried to ruin my life for chasing a little tail . I 'm here to do my job . Why don 't you do the same ? Did you see anyone unusual ? Anyone in your class ? No . And did he mention anything to you ? Anything in private ? Why would he ? 'Cause you were his teacher 's assistant . Oh . I thought that he might have mentioned if something unusual had happened . No , he didn 't . Nothing . We 've been trying to track Kinberg 's whereabouts over the past week . We spoke to his wife , and she said that he ... had arrived home , just before midnight , the last two nights . But according to his schedule , his last class started at 6 : 00 . He 's had extended office hours this week . Well , could I get a list of the students he talked to ? It was drop-in . I 'm not really sure . I 'm sorry . After what happened today , I feel like nothing 's real . - That was crazy . It was - - How long were you seeing him ? Professor Kinberg . Three months . I knew he was gonna take the job . He hadn 't even told his wife about it yet . What job was that ? I shouldn 't . He wasn 't supposed to tell me . It 's okay . The C.D.C ... Centers for Disease Control . They offered him this big job , which meant moving to Atlanta . So I figured that was gonna be it for us . And what exactly was the job ? Task force , to oversee the country 's preparedness to fight off an epidemic . It sounded like a big deal . Can I come in ? I hate that ... knocking and asking while you 're coming in . Dr. Kinberg , the professor who died at Boston College , was offered a job at the C.D.C , to co-chair a classified task force whose sole responsibility was to respond to epidemics . And ? He wasn 't the only scientist asked . There was another one ... Dr. Russell Simon from Cambridge . I 'm trying to locate him now . What , you think he 's a target too ? I do . And I also think that the people who killed Kinberg are the same people who took me . And how 'd you make that leap ? Walter , he thinks the thing that killed Dr. Kinberg is genetically similar to some evidence that I grabbed from the people who abducted me . But why abduct you ? What 's the link ? And why kill Kinberg like that ? I don 't know yet . But so far I figured why kill an epidemiologist unless you 're looking to start an epidemic ? Get rid of the firefighter before you start a fire . And why am I just now hearing of this ? Because your friend Sanford Harris forbade me from investigating my own abduction . Harris . He 's put everything on hold . Has , uh , requested that I run all operations past him before we move . - Is that even possible ? - Apparently . Sir , I 'm asking you to save a man 's life . Are you telling me that you don 't have the authority to let me do my job ? Find Simon . Get him in protective custody now . Thank you . I 'll handle Harris . I know you will . Hey , Rach , it 's me . Can we just meet at the apartment ? - Is that okay ? - Yeah , sure . I have the key . Is everything okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I won 't be too late . And if you get hungry , there 's food in the fridge , or there are some menus by the phone in the kitchen if you want to order in . Don 't worry about us at all . Ella 's having a blast . Okay , I 'll see you tonight . - I love you . - You too . Bye ! I 'm going to cambridge to pick up Russell Simon . Who 's that ? A man we 're taking into protective custody . I 'll give you the details on the way . Oh , I 'm going with you ? - Yeah . - Meet you downstairs . - Hey , Mitch . - Hey . Listen , Olivia , your abduction . I 'm gonna coordinate the investigation . I assume everything you remember is already in your debrief . Yeah . If I find anything , I 'll let you know . - We 'll find ' em . - That 's great , Mitch . Thank you . Thank you so much , Dr. Simon , for cooperating . I suppose I should be thanking you . FBI tells you they 're here to save your life , you listen . Well , I know it must seem confusing . Well , it 's certainly shocking . Miles was a dear friend . I am sorry . Know that we 're doing everything we can to bring those responsible to justice . The C.D.C. wasn 't expecting me for three months . Who else knew you were planning on taking this job ? Well , no one . Just my wife . I was instructed not to tell anyone . And is there anyone you can think of who might be targeting you ? Maybe students whose grades they might have felt were undeserved . Will you excuse us for a moment ? I need to talk to my agents . Sure . Can you give us a minute ? So I understand that you have requested placing Dr. Simon in protective custody . I believe that his life may be in danger . Yeah , well , that 's taxpayer dollars , Miss Dunham , and I haven 't approved that . Let me ask you a question . Not that I don 't enjoy having you here , But how long are you planning on sticking around ? Until I have made a full assessment of how this office conducts its business . Did Broyles approve your request ? No , he did not . Mr. Harris , you don 't like me , you don 't respect me , and you think I 'm bad at my job . But please , don 't let that get in the way of doing the right thing . That man in there may likely die if we don 't keep him safe . I 'm not asking you to like me . I 'm asking you to do the right thing . Yeah , we 'll keep him safe . Thank you . This is Dunham . Walter 's still trying to determine what that thing is that came out of Kinberg . But I think we made a breakthrough . Okay , so what is it ? It seems to be activated by a liquid . What does ? The parasite ? The yellow powdery stuff in the vials that you stole , they 're like eggs , But the catalyst is stomach acid . So the victim just needs to ingest it ? Exactly right , and then it grows ... fast . Thank you . No problem . And is there any way to trace it , where it came from ? Walter doesn 't seem to think so , no . Dr. Simon , with your permission , I 'd like to take you to our field office . We 'll debrief you , go over your options . Then we 'll move you to a safe house . You okay ? Yeah . There 'll be agents there on call 24 hours a day . Breathe . This is Agent Francis . I need medical attention in room six . I called medical assistance . Oh , my God . It 's viral . Nasopharyngitis , albeit a gargantuan specimen . What ... what does that mean ? This organism is a single specimen of a virus for the common cold . So you 're saying that this is one single cell ? It 's not unprecedented . The ostrich egg is a single cell , and it can grow up to five pounds . They supersized the common cold , which , as it turns out , is disgusting . Obviously somebody 's playing with us . Yeah , they 're showing off . Killing epidemiologist with the common cold . It is impressive . What I want to know is what they wanted from you . Oh , who cares about me ? I want to know who 's next . I care about you . If we can figure out why they needed you , then maybe we can figure out who 's next . I 'm gonna keep looking for someone who 's connected to Kinberg and Simon . She is beautiful , isn 't she ? Who ? The slug . You know , I could have cooked for you . Uh , no , thanks . I 've tasted your cooking . Hey , I 've gotten really good , you know . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . No , I haven 't . I didn 't think so . Hard day ? Uh , I honestly wouldn 't know what to tell you . And if I did , it would be a felony . You have a crazy job . Yeah , I have a crazy job . Cheers . Cheers . Have you heard from Greg ? I don 't know how to do this alone . Ella is beautiful , and smart , and strong , and she gets that from you . Me ? No . You 've always been the strong one , you have . Rach . I 've only done one thing right in my life . Then you need to be strong for her . Whatever you need , I 'm here . And you guys can stay here as long as you want . Thank you . Is there something else ? Something you 're not telling me ? No . No , there 's nothing else . How goes it ? Horrible . We 'll find ' em , whoever 's responsible for what happened . Maybe this 'll help . I need to talk to you . Charlie , I think I know who killed Simon . And I think it 's the same person who abducted me . Who ? Mitchell Loeb . Don 't ask me how I know . I 'll tell you later . Livvy , that can 't be right . It is . And I can prove it . But I 've got Harris watching me like a prison guard . I can 't do this myself . What do you need ? Walter , is that LSD ? LSD , why would I ... It 's a decongestant . She is a giant cold virus after all . Right . Peter . You got a moment ? What 's up ? Olivia may have a lead on who abducted her . Only she can 't pursue it without some help . I can 't help her . Why not ? Suffice it to say that sometimes a problem with being in law enforcement is that you gotta obey the law yourself . And you think I 'm the guy to break the law for you ? - I 'm sorry , I didn 't ... - No , look , you 're right . I am the guy to break the law for you . What do we need ? I need a wiretap . On who ? Mitchell Loeb . FBI . Hello ? Samantha . Olivia , hi . I was just in Marlborough . I thought I 'd drop by and check to see if you 're okay . I don 't understand . I don 't know . I guess I hadn 't talked to you since Mitchell 's surgery . Well , how sweet of you . Would you like to come inside ? Have a cup of tea ? Yeah , thank you . I 've been thinking a lot about you and everything that you and Mitchell went through . It 's really lovely having him back at the office . Oh , yes , he 's really glad to be back . His recovery seemed to go smoothly . What were you doing in Marlborough ? I 'm working on a case . Well , what 's the case ? Suspicion of a double agent . Excuse me . I 'll get the tea . Mind if I use your bathroom ? It 's down the hall . Thank you . Kyle . Hey , man . Can you grab me that phone ? All right , go ahead . Okay , so I enter the phone number and then just punch in that code ? Kyle , you are the greatest man . Have I told you that lately ? Yeah , thanks . You too . He used to work at the phone company , but I never really understood why . The guy 's a genius . Yeah , right . Wouldn 't want to waste any of that potential . He tapped into the Loebs ' home phone number . We should be able to pick up any outgoing calls that make from their house . This is Mitchell . Olivia Dunham is in our house . Why ? She claims she was here to check on you . Is it working ? No . Hey , Kyle , it 's not working . All I 'm getting is buzz . I don 't hear anything . I think she knows . I don 't know how she could . I don 't know what to do . Well , I do . And you have to move fast . What ? You need to kill her . Right now . Her office might know that she 's here . How can I just - Dunham 's already under suspicion for being unstable . They think she 's dangerous . All right , I 'll try it again . We can say she came after you , that it was self-defense . There has to be another way to do this . There isn 't , honey . There 's one way . You cannot let Dunham leave there alive . In the entry closet , top shelf , in the back , there 's a gun . Contact me when it 's done . - What is it ? - Olivia 's in trouble . - What happened ? - Hold on a second . Come on , pick up , pick up . It 's me . Get out of the house . She 's gonna kill you . - What ? - Samantha Loeb is going to kill you . Get out of the house right now . Olivia . Tea 's ready . Olivia ? Samantha . Turn around and put the gun on the ground . Put the gun down . Now get down on the ground . Samantha . Please , don 't hurt me . Get on the ground , Samantha . - I was just doing my ... - Samantha , get down on the ground now . I don 't want to shoot you , but I will . What are you gonna do to me ? Are you gonna hurt me ? Damn it , Samantha , shut the hell up and get down on the ground . Don 't do it . Please get down ! There 's nothing here . Loeb knew he was gonna cut and run . Based on what you 've found , you have nothing to trace . No , nothing yet . I 'll need more time to trace the origin of the virus , But even then it will be impossible to know the exact origin . Liv , I hate to even ask you this . Anything you remember from when they had you ? No , there 's nothing that I heard , like nothing that I remember . There 's no other way to track Loeb 's cell phone ? Tech services tried everything . Wait a minute , not everything . The agents at Loeb 's house , they 're surveilling the area , right ? - No sign of Loeb ? - Not yet . So he doesn 't know about his wife . No , he doesn 't . Meaning that she could still contact him . I 'm ahead of you . I 'll get a team . What happened ? I missed it . Okay , we need Samantha Loeb 's cell phone . - I think inventory has it . - I 'm on it . - Nice work . - Thanks . It 's all rather tense , isn 't it ? He 's gonna come . Assuming , of course , they text each other . Do you see him yet ? No , not yet . Peter was really worried about you when you were gone . - Walter . - You were . Well , of course I was worried . He was really worried . We got him . Okay , you stay here . Mitchell , put it down ! Put it down ! Freeze ! Drop it . Drop your weapon . You 're under arrest . Nice work . Thank you . Who are you working for ? Don 't be an idiot , Loeb . This is your one chance to cooperate . I 'd say to you that you have no idea how hard we 're gonna come down on you , except you do . I want to see my wife . You 're not getting a thing until you talk . Then you 're outta luck . Why 'd you kill them , Kinberg and Simon ? And why like that ? I mean , there are easier ways to take somebody out . You 're getting nothing . She can 't do it . She won 't get a confession . I 'd say the evidence in his house is plenty . Well , I 'd say evidence is no confession . Ask as many questions as you want . Why take me ? And that spinal tap , what did you want ? Loeb , this is your last chance to cooperate . Or what , you 'll torture me ? Can you leave me alone with him ? What 's she doing ? You want your wife , Mitch ? Yeah , Olivia , I do . Okay . Okay . And do you want to know who pulled the trigger ? Mitch . You 're looking at her . Did you kill them ? - Did you ? - Yes ! Do you not understand the rules ? What we 're up against ? Who the two sides are ? - Tell me at least you know that . - Who 's we ? We had a plan here , lady . We had a shot . And you just blew it . And why did you kidnap me ? Kidnap you ? Idiot . We saved you . Saved me from what ? We were going to let you go . We saved you . You ... you have no idea what you 've done . Not a clue . There 's your confession . You need to get some rest . I think you 've earned it . I 'll see you tomorrow . Thank you . Thank you . He 's right . You should get home . What did he mean he saved me ? What the hell was that ? He was messing with you . Well , I don 't know . I mean , did you see him ? There was something about the way he said that . The man 's insane , Olivia . I concur , and in the category of takes one to know one ... That man did seem disturbed . But then why take me ? Because they wanted to hurt you . They knew that you were investigating them . They wanted to take you out . Then why not just kill me ? You 're talking about a man who infects people with giant viruses . If you hadn 't escaped , who knows what they would have done to you . Listen to me , you 'd just told him that you killed his wife . He said that to you to try and get a reaction out of you , to get to you . Let it go . You got his confession . Go home . I was worried , too , when you were taken . Thank you , Walter . Not as much as him , of course . - Walter . - It 's true .

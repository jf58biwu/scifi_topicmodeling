 Let me tell you about my day so far . Coffee in Paris , surfed the Maldives , took a little nap on Mount Kilimanjaro . Oh , yeah , and I got digits from this Polish chick in Rio . And then I jumped back for the final quarter of the NBA finals . Courtside , of course . And all that was before lunch . I could go on , but all I 'm saying is I 'm standing on top of the world . The lighter terrain here ... It wasn 't always like this . ... is more heavily cratered . Once , I was a normal person . A chump , just like you . - Hey , Millie . - Hey , David . You got a lot of cities there . Well , if you 're gonna have a dream , might as well dream big , right ? Right . See you later . Hey , Millie ! Give me a sec . Hey . He 's such a loser . I just wanted to give you this . I picked it up at a yard sale in Plymouth . I thought you 'd really like it . It 's a little dinged up and it 's missing a few steps , but ... I love it . - You do ? - I do . Holy crap , Ricebowl ! Mark . Hey , what 's this ? - Mark , stop it . Mark . - Christmas come early ? - Mark , give it back to her . - Holy crap ! - Look what David got Millie ! - Mark , come on . Stop . You guys like the Eiffel Tower ? Wow ! If you really shake this thing hard enough , you can hear the Eiffel Tower move , I swear to God . Hey ! Who wants to give it a shake ? That 's enough ! Stop it . Just give it back . All right , okay . I 'm sorry . Here . Sorry , buddy . Guess I don 't know my own strength . - Why are you such a jerk ? - I was just playing around . - It wasn 't funny . - They thought it was pretty funny . David ? David , don 't go out there ! It 's not safe ! David , just forget about it ! Come on , Ricebowl . Don 't be stupid ! David , come back ! Come on , just let it go . It 's okay . Stop ! It 's not worth it . Just come back , please . Come on , David . Be careful . Come on . All good , see ? Great . Now come back ! - David ! - Millie , don 't go out there ! David ! Get help , somebody ! Mark , let go ! David ! Get help ! Help ! Please ! Help ! David ! - Call 911 ! - You can 't help him ! David ! Millie , stop , stop ! And that 's how it happened the first time . One second , I 'm a goner , and next thing I know , I 'm at the Ann Arbor Public Library . Home , sweet home . Mom left when I was five . As for Dad , well ... Let 's just say he wasn 't much of one . You 're late ! Supper 's cold . Where you been , anyway ? Hey , you know when I ask a question , I expect an answer , okay ? Hey , hey , hey . What happened to you ? Just kids at school . Hey ! Hey , David ! Get back down here , get a mop and clean this crap up right now ! David ! Don 't make me come up there ! David ? Make the right choice ! David ? David ! Open the door ! Did I just teleport ? Great . I can teleport to the library . No , I 'm not going . Fine ... - Get in the car . - No , no , no . I 'm not going anywhere . And that 's when it occurred to me . This thing that just happened , it could set me free . And if she could run away , so could I. Okay . I wanted to tell her everything . David ? David ? I mean , who would have believed me anyway ? David ? I figured it was time to move on . I 'd like a room . You 're not gonna be any trouble , are you ? No weird stuff ? Nope . No weird stuff . And so there I was . I had a million questions . Like how does this thing work ? How do I control it ? - Been there . - Mommy ! Mommy ! You can see the ocean and everything ! If we 're lucky , maybe we 'll see King Kong . Really ? You got me ? I got you . I 'm not letting you go . I was 15 . Come on . What would you have done ? I figured I 'd pay it back someday Is there a bathroom for customers ? Hey . It 's this way . Yeah . Make it quick . No problem . Thanks . I 'm going to need a bigger bag . Holy shit . Hey ! I said no weird stuff ! Let 's go . Two days rent ! You owe me rent ! Hello ? Hello ! The police and the FBI have already been through here . Who are you with ? NSA . They couldn 't make heads or tails of it . The vault has a time lock , pressure mounts , steel plates ... - This guy didn 't even open a door . - Open a door ? We didn 't know we were robbed until halfway through the day . I want the security tapes for the whole month and I need the name of everyone who has a safety deposit box in that vault . No , that 's confidential . Why do you need those names ? Whoever robbed your vault has been in it before . Now I want those names and I want those tapes . Today . So the story had a happy ending . Ricebowl was dead , but I 'd never been more alive . So now I 'm living in New York . But why settle on one place when you can have the whole world ? ... is closer to the river . But as you can see , this flood became more severe about 10 minutes ago . The question now , Pat , is what will happen to these people ? It would take a miracle to get to them . Good afternoon , Mr. Jones . - How they doing ? - Down by six at the half . Don 't think you 'll be needing that umbrella . You never know . Watch it ! You mind if I join you ? - No . - What can I get you ? What are you drinking ? Gin and tonic . Tanqueray and tonic . Two of them , please . So , you live in London ? Taxi ! Shit . Dude , this totally sucks . Hey , I thought this was where the storm was supposed to hit . I heard it hit Fiji . Fiji , huh ? Yeah , they got , like , 30-foot swells . Really ? To your left ! Move ! We got him ! Let 's go . Okay , okay . - Why ? - Because you are an abomination . Only God should have the power to be all places at all times . One less of you to worry about . Cut him down ! Let 's get the hell out of here . Yeah . We have a lead on the bank , sir . I 'll be on the next plane . Hey , Angelo , how 'd they do ? Not so good . Told you , you wouldn 't be needing that umbrella . Yeah . You were right . Don 't run . Eight years we 've been looking for you . And who are you ? My name 's Roland . - What are you doing in my apartment ? - We 'll get to that . What kind of crook leaves a note ? I think I need to talk to my lawyers . Why ? You 're not under arrest . - You mean you 're not the ... - Police ? Anybody can rob a bank . What I 'd like to know is how you rob a bank without opening any doors . Come on . I 'm sure you can think of something . Look , if you 're not the police , and I 'm not under arrest , I think I 'd like you to leave . You need some help with that ? Been a while since you used a door , huh ? I know who you are . And I know what you are . This conversation 's over . This conversation 's not over until you answer my questions ! Tell me , how 'd you last this long ? Who 's helping you ? Jumpers . Kind of hard to jump with 1,000 volts of electricity passing through your brain , huh ? Who 's protecting you ? Give me an answer so I can go home . I hate Jumpers . Did you think you could go on like this forever ? Living like this with no consequences ? There are always consequences . Where are you going ? I got you now . You think you can hide behind a wall ? Go anywhere ? Do anything ? Not anymore ! David ? David ? Is that you ? David ! David , don 't go ! Don 't go . Just hear me out , okay ? David , I don 't know if I 'm going crazy here or not , all right ? I don 't know a lot of things these days , but if you can hear me ... Just wait , David . Don 't go , I gotta talk to you ! David , if you can hear me , son , it 's okay . You can come home any time you want . You 're not crazy . Telecommunications . This is Roland . He got away . We have his jump sites . I want everybody up and running . Everybody . Who is this ? May I help you ? Yeah ... Hi , Mrs. Harris . It 's me , David . David ? David Rice ? - Millie was right . You 're not ... - Dead ? Yeah . No , I 'm not . Actually , I was hoping you could tell me where to find Millie . Millie ? She 's got her own place over on Morton , number 260 . She 's still here ? Yeah . She works at Hoolihan 's Bar , down by the campus . Millie , I need those pitchers ! Okay , you saw her . Holy crap ! Ricebowl ? Mark ! Mark Kobold ! Sorry , man . I don 't know you . Jesus Christ , am I seeing a ghost ? Is this some kind of sixth sense shit ? I don 't know what you 're talking about , okay ? Hey , everybody , it 's Ricebowl ! Come on . Don 't you wanna grab a beer with an old buddy from high school ? - I 'm not this ... - David ? Knew it was the Ricecake . Millie ? Hi . You were going to leave without saying anything ? - Sorry , I didn 't see you . - No ? Weren 't you just up there staring at me for the past 45 minutes ? Yeah , David . Why didn 't you say something , huh ? - I think you 're drunk . - I 'm not drunk , okay ? I 'm cool . I am totally , 110 % cool . Yeah , that was really cool . Why don 't you go find a bench and sleep it off , okay ? Why don 't you go make me a drink , sweetheart ? A little splash of that . Hey ! Come on ! Mark ! Stop it ! Come on , you guys . Stop ! - Get up ! - Ricebowl goes down ! What did you do to me , freak ? I guess I don 't know my own strength . - Hey . - Hey . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Where 's Mark ? - He took off . - What ? Yeah , I don 't think he 's gonna come back anytime soon . You 're bleeding a little . We should take care of that . Come on . So you saw me as soon as I came in ? Maybe . I didn 't know what to say . How about , " Hi . " " Hello . " " Been a long time . " " How are you ? " Yeah ! Hi . Hello . Been a long time . How are you ? I 'm good . How are you ? Why don 't we skip this boring stuff ? You know , I didn 't think you 'd still be here . Where else would I be ? You had those lists , right ? And , I don 't know , you were gonna go travel the world , and ... Things change . We all need to grow up , right ? So what do you do ? Banking . I 'm in banking . You 're in banking ? How did you get into that ? It 's pretty easy , actually . I just sort of landed in it . Didn 't you flunk algebra ? No . Fiona , I 'm gonna take my break now , okay ? Yeah , sure . So , you 're back . What now ? What 's your plan ? Maybe gonna do some traveling . I was thinking of maybe checking out Rome , actually . You were thinking of checking out Rome ? Come on , you know that was my dream . Don 't try to rip me off , okay ? - So come with me . - So come with you ? You 're asking me to go to Rome ? I mean , only if you want to skip the boring parts . I got it . I 'll take it ! Thank you . - As you like it . - Yeah . Yeah . Can you believe just 10 hours ago we were in Ann Arbor ? Yeah . What does the CIA want with this ? I 'm afraid that 's classified . Really ? Well , then I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to see a federal warrant . 'Cause I don 't believe you are who you say you are . Certainly . Great . Another cop . So , Mark , tell me what happened at the bank . I told them already . You 're just another suit . You 're never gonna believe me . It says here you were beamed into the vault . You want to laugh about it ? Go ahead , have a laugh . You hear me laughing ? The girl 's name is Millie Harris . She boarded a plane to Rome 16 hours ago and she didn 't go alone . So , what do you think ? I think there 's something you 're not telling me . What do you mean ? This room . First class . Usually in my life , when things seem too good to be true , it 's because they are . - I told you , I 'm in banking . - Banking ? See , I know that you flunked algebra . David , if you don 't wanna tell me everything , that 's fine . But just don 't lie to me . I 'm not lying to you . No ? Good . I can 't reach it . I could eat . You know , you could have just asked me out on a date . You know , this has always been number one on my list . I know . You must be pretty good at this , huh ? Good at what ? Rookie . No idea . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Wait , wait , wait ! Sorry , sir . Sorry , sorry , sorry . No . - What ? - No , no , it 's impossible . It 's closed . - It 's closed ? - Yes . What do you mean , it 's closed ? How is it closed ? No , you see , we just want to go inside there . We 're just gonna go walk around a bit , yeah ? It 's impossible . No , no . It 's the Colosseum . How is it closed ? It 's impossible . David , it 's okay . I got to see it from outside . That 's good enough . You know , she came all this way to go inside . Hey . Come on . Sorry , he 's ... I don 't know . Bye . Millie ! Come on . - What ? - Come on ! How about a private tour ? It 's closed . We can 't break into the Colosseum . Who said it 's closed ? The door was open . You want to see the Colosseum or not ? Come on . We so should not be doing this . This place is amazing . I wanted you to see this . You gotta admit , it 's worth the risk . Yeah . - It 's so cool ! - It is . Down here is where they used to keep the gladiators and the lions in cages . - We should go down there . - We can 't go down there . - It 's off-limits , even when it 's open . - Nothing 's off-limits . What ? Millie ! Was that door just open , too ? - It 's open now . - Yeah . You 're gonna want to see this . Trust me . Bet you that 's worth something . Maybe . I think he 's telling you , " Do not enter . " You speak Italian ? Nope . Well , " I 'ingresso " means " Come on in . " I thought it meant " bullshit . " Well , that means that you should stay here while I go around and open it from the other side . It 's all right . You 'll catch on . Thank you very much . The next showing will be at 6 : 00 . Don 't forget to tip your usher . What ? A little busy here . Yeah , I can see that . Never mind . Hey , I wouldn 't open that door if I were you . Not if I wanted my girlfriend to keep breathing , I wouldn 't . But that 's just me . What are you going to do anyway ? You gonna bring her down , have a nice little romantic picnic ? Nice little tea party ? - Is that what you think 's gonna happen ? - You so much as look at her wrong ... What you gonna do ? What you gonna do ? You gonna jump me away ? Did you think you were the only one ? You really have no idea , do you ? You lead the life you live . Did you think you could just go on a little Roman holiday and they wouldn 't notice ? Just jump all over the place . Jump , jump , jump , and nothing 's gonna happen ? But they 've noticed . Not me . I mean , I already knew . Not me . I 'm not talking about me , but them . Down there . Hello , boys . Just me , then . That 's new . Welcome to the war . Just let me know if you guys are getting tired ! Close . David ? What 's going on ? Great ! Let 's meet the girlfriend , shall we ? Who are these people ? Paladins . Paladins kill Jumpers . I kill Paladins . Class dismissed . Wait ! I just came through your jump scar . What do you think you 're doing here ? If I were you , I 'd jump right back . You 're not supposed to see all this stuff . You 're not supposed to be here . Get out . So if you 'd like to kindly fuck off , as in now , maybe your girlfriend 's still alive . - Hey . - Hey . - What happened to you ? - Nothing . - Let 's go . Come on . - What ? I think we should just get out of here . That didn 't sound like nothing . You were right , okay ? I shouldn 't have gone down there . - David ... - Everything 's fine . Come on . We can still make the museum . David , will you talk to me ? Please ? There must be a cab around here somewhere . Wait , why aren 't you talking to me ? Will you please just talk to me ? Look , I 'll tell you everything back at the hotel , okay ? I 'm not waiting for the hotel . Look , Millie , it 's all fine , okay ? It 's just ... - No , it 's not all fine . - I wasn 't supposed to go back there . - No , I think you guys made a mistake . - Be quiet . You 're looking for that guy over there , yeah ? I know we weren 't supposed ... Look , I 'm sorry . I know I wasn 't supposed to be back there , okay ? You 're looking for a man over there , okay ? Can 't you just let us off with a warning ? Okay , okay . Okay , okay , okay . - Millie , just go back to the hotel , okay ? - No . - No , no , we 're not together . - Yes , I 'm with him . I 'm with him ! I don 't know her . Millie , go back to the hotel . No . I told you I want to see Millie . Where is the body ? I didn 't do anything , okay ? I don 't know how many times you want me to tell you the same thing . Do you know how much longer he 's gonna be back there ? We wait for magistrato . Yeah , I know . We 've been waiting for a magistrato all night . I don 't speak your ... I don 't know what you 're saying . Now you sit or we sit you . Okay . I sit . - Sit ! - I sit . She 's got nothing to do with this . The magistrate is here . We will hold on to your passport . Don 't worry . You won 't need it where you 're going . Hello , David . You 've only got about 30 seconds before they come through that door . Do you understand ? You have to get out of here . Ditch the girl . If she 's with you , she 's dead . Mom ! Mom ! Twenty seconds , David . Mom ! Mom ! Hey ! Millie . - All done . You okay ? - Yeah . - We 're free to walk . - They just let you go ? They just let me go . - Just like that ? - Just like that . If they just let you go , then why are we running ? They just really strongly suggested that we leave town now . - What did they say to you ? - Asked me some questions . For eight hours ? They had a lot of questions . I really want to trust you . You 're making it extremely difficult . All right , so trust me . Let 's go . Hey , can you take us ? Yeah ? Get in the cab , Millie . Millie , get in the car . Please , please get in the cab . That 's yours . You remember how I told you you didn 't need to tell me everything ? I changed my mind . What 's in the backpack ? Where did you get that ? I don 't want to lie to you . But you don 't want to tell me the truth , either . I can 't get on this flight with you , Millie . This is as far as we go together . To Detroit ? - Roland . - We lost him , sir . - How many did you send ? - Two men . I told you to send everybody . She said two would be enough . But they missed him . It 's like he knew we were coming . We 're searching the grid now . Keep me informed . I 'm taking a different tack . - William Rice ? - Yeah . IRS . Could we go inside and talk ? I don 't have to ask . That 's a courtesy . So what 's this all about ? Your son , David . Why ? Is he in some kind of trouble or something ? This will go a lot swifter if you let me ask the questions . So when 's the last time you saw your son ? Eight years ago . Eight years ? That 's right . What about friends ? - Anybody I can talk to ? - He didn 't have a whole lot of friends . I 'd like to talk to David 's mother if I could . Yeah . Me , too . If you find her , tell her I said hello . Is that her ? Mary Rice , at least that was her name back then . When 's the last time you saw her ? She split when the kid turned five . Five . Haven 't heard a word since . If I hear anything , I 'll be sure to give you a holler . No , you won 't . No , I won 't . A special move you can do on this new thing now . It 's , like , they 've added this new control , and , like , if you just double click ... See that ? Pretty sick . Whoa . Still alive , are you ? - He 's dead ! - What ? That 's just great . - There 's more of them ? - Hundreds more . I 'm tracking 10 right now . What do you care ? There 's lots more . - What about the rest ? - What about the rest ? Like I said , I hunt them . - So who are these guys ? - I told you , they 're Paladins . Yeah , you told me their name . You didn 't tell me what they want . Well , it 's pretty simple , isn 't it ? They want us dead . Didn 't you figure that out yet ? Yeah , no , I got that much . - Good , I 'm glad . Do you mind just ... - Yeah , thanks . Why ? Because we can do whatever the hell we want . Now can you please just ... - He 's dead . - Great . Thanks . You really don 't get it , do you ? Paladins have been killing Jumpers for years , way back since medieval times . They 're fanatics , religious nut jobs . The Inquisition , witch hunts ... That was them . Look , they 're smart , they 're fast , they 're organized . No matter what , they 'll kill anyone that gets in their way , like your family , your friends , that little girlfriend you had traipsing around Rome with you . They 're dead . All of them . Get used to it . It 's just a matter of time . I 'm gonna get some takeaway . Do you want some ? Somebody get some help ! Now ! - What happened ? - What 's going on in here ? Get me a gurney now ! Let me look . Get the paddles ! He smashed through the glass in the other room ? Are you okay ? Stay still . How is he ? - I 'm not getting a pulse . - Defib ! What the hell happened here ? - Mark . - Jesus Christ . What did you tell him ? - Don 't touch me . - How did they know about Ann Arbor ? - Stay the hell away from me ! - Who 'd you tell ? Who 'd you talk to ? Was it a black guy with white hair ? Was his name Roland ? Just answer the question , or I 'll drop you off the top of Mount Everest , okay ? - What ? What ? I don 't ... - What did you tell him ? What ? Tell what ? I know you told him about home , all right ? I know you told him about Ann Arbor . - Did you tell him about Millie ? - I told him everything . Why ? Why did you do that ? - Why not ? - God ! Who are you ? Where 'd the Paladin go ? - Swimming . - Pacific ? No , actually , Atlantic . A nice little shark pit around Cuba . What do you think you 're doing ? Put that stuff back . Actually , I need to borrow a few things . Just stay away from the wall ! I 'll cut your eyes out ! - I need to find Roland . - No , you don 't . No , you don 't ! - I only got eight hours . - Eight hours ? All right ? There 's a girl . Her flight lands in eight hours . You think that stuff 's gonna help you ? That stuff 's , like , four years old . Do you want me to jump you back to high school so you can learn something ? I 've been tracking him for 10 years . Look at this . Look . You see this ? Our first round in Nepal . You should see the one he gave me back in Prague . Look , forget it . Forget Roland . Don 't waste your time . Just leave it to me . - Do you mind ? - Look ... A little privacy here ? You know , this is kind of my thing . Just , you know , turn around . I was thinking that if we do this together , we could get him . - What ? You mean , like , you and me ? - Yeah . - Like we team up ? - Yeah . Look , I 'm sorry , but I don 't play well with others . Do me a favor , yeah ? Don 't be here when I get back . Find a rock , crawl under it , stay there . Zaihuei , brother . It 's " goodbye " in Chinese . Yeah . No , I 've been meaning to call , really . I still really want to get the tattoo . All right ... You can 't keep following me . Actually , I 'm the one person who can . Lucky me . Why are you walking ? I mean , I know Tokyo pretty well . I got a lot of jump sites here , so ... You know what ? I like walking for a change . It makes me feel normal . You ever read Marvel Team-Up ? Yeah , I 've read it . And ? Two superheroes joining forces for , like , a limited run . I see what you 're trying to do , yeah ? I 'm not buying it . For your own sake , just go home . - You live in a cave . - It 's called a lair . And what 's the point ? I 'm just saying , you know , we kind of have this common thing . And I know where to find Roland . So we doing this or what ? Sorry . The clutch stuck . You 're real subtle . Yeah , I 'm not gonna get rid of you , am I ? Might want to hold on , son . That was close . Not bad . This thing must be two tons easy . How are you ... If it moves , I can jump it . Actually , I knew this Jumper once . Crazy bastard . Tried to hop a whole building . Won 't be trying that again . - Why 's that ? - That 's ' cause he 's dead . Killed him . He still managed to shake it a little , though . So how long have you been doing this for ? - Doing what ? Driving ? - No . Jumping ? - Since I was five . - Five ? Yeah . How did you keep it a secret from people , like your parents ? It 's pretty easy when they 're not around . Where were they ? Not around . You know , my mom , she took off when I was five . I know what it 's like to not , you know ... My dad , he ... Did I ask about your family ? I mean , are we on Oprah here or ... Griffin , I can 't keep doing this ! I gotta go . Her flight lands any second . I need an answer . This is it , all right ? Marvel Team-Up , now or never . A very limited run , right ? Save her , kill him , you know . We 're done . All right , Spidey . Due to increased security measures , all bags are subject to search . Detroit International Airport asks you to keep your bags in your possession at all times . Hey . The flight from Rome landed an hour ago . Oh , no . You didn 't check on the flight . All right , well , we gotta find her , you know . You go find her . I 'm gonna arm up . Meet me back at the lair . - All right . - Fine . What 're you looking at ? Boo ! Hey . I 'm Millie 's friend , David . Is she here ? Last I checked , she was with you . Hey ! Your friend came by . What are you talking about ? Black guy , white hair . You just missed him . Come on . Hey . - Jesus . - Hey . David , what ... What the hell are you doing here ? I buzzed , but you didn 't pick up . So you just broke in ? Yeah . Well , I needed to make sure that you were okay . No , David , I 'm not okay . I got left in an airport in Rome . I 'm sorry . You 're sorry ? Thank you . I think you should leave . David , you need to leave ! Come on . Snap to it . We don 't have much time . What ? What are you doing ? David , I told you to leave . What ? - I 'm not in banking . Okay ? - What ? No , really ? I mean , the money did come from a bank , you know . Yeah . A few banks , actually . Are you telling me you 're a bank robber ? That 's a small part . Will you please get out of my house ? Millie , I 'm sorry . Okay . - I 'm really sorry . - Just go . - We got to go . - Just leave me alone ! Come on ! This might hurt a little bit , okay ? It 's okay . Trust me , okay ? I 'm not gonna hurt you . - The first jump can be a little ... - Don 't you even come near me . Don 't touch me . Don 't come near me ! I 'm gonna explain this , all right ? I 'm gonna explain everything . In here . Just stay where you are , all right ? Stay right there . David ! Hurry up ! It 's closing ! Griffin ! There 's something I gotta tell you . So did you find her ? There 's something that 's gonna piss you off a little bit . - Piss me off ? - David ? - What is this ? - David ? What 's she doing here ? This isn 't some kind of clubhouse , you know . - David , what is going on ? - Millie , I told you to stay inside . You want to see the top of Mount Everest ? Maybe the bottom ? - I don 't know . It 's up to you . - What ? Griffin , listen to me , all right ? That 's what I was trying to tell you , okay ? By bringing her down here , they can follow you ! They have a machine . It can open wormholes and keep them open . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm saying they can follow us anywhere ! And you brought her here ! Shit . There 's two of you ? David , what is going on ? - Millie . Millie , stay right here ! - No . What have you done ? - Griffin ... - Where does this thing go ? - we gotta go . - David , what did you do ? Holy shit . Mom ? Thanks for leading me to your friend . Wait , wait , wait ! Why are you doing this to me ? I never hurt you . I never hurt anybody . Not yet , but you will . Sooner or later , you all go bad . What if I 'm different ? - You 're not different . - I 'm different . Boo ! Move ! It 's time to send you home to Mommy . - David ? - Millie ! David ? Millie , get out of here . Run , okay ? Millie ! Millie , run ! I 'm only getting you down so you can get me out of here . Okay . Can you take me now , please ? Okay , I 'll take you . I 'll leave you alone . It was always you , though . Ever since we were five . It was always you . Please just take me . Take a deep breath . I got it ! I trapped them there . Without the machine , they 're screwed ! Millie ! - Got her ! - No ! Millie ! Bloody ... Wow . Crap . I didn 't expect that . I didn 't know . Now they have to come to us . Let 's get these fires out . - What 's that ? - What ? What ? What are you doing ? Nothing . I was , you know , thinking about going bowling . What ? Roland 's in there with his whole army . I 'm gonna go back there and end this . What do you think ? Yeah , I 'm gonna blow them to Timbuktu . Millie 's in there . Well , yeah , there is that as well , but ... I gotta go get her . Griffin , it 's my fault that she 's there , all right ? - You can 't just ... - What ? We gotta get her out of there , all right ? - We have to get her out of there ! - I can hear you ! I 'm not deaf ! I understand what you 're saying . - I can actually hear . - All right , well ... It 's a crying shame , it really is , but you know what ? We all have to make sacrifices once in a while . You know . Where 's the detonator ? - I don 't see you making any . - Hey , you know what ? I made mine . All right ? When I was five . He came to my house and killed my parents . David , David . Look , before this gets out of hand , let 's just talk about ... Just ... How about this for talking ? Am I getting the message through to you ? I can 't let you do this . Look , David , you touch the safe again , I 'm gonna kill you ! Have you got it ?

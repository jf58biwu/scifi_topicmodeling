 She saw me coming . I think you underestimated her . She still dies . She 's gone now . I 'm just saying . - You okay ? - No . Not until we find that case . When was the last time you saw it ? Not since yesterday . No luck on trying . If we don 't find it soon ... Their gonna kill my mom . And it 's gonna be my fault . Look at me . Hey ! Look at me . Will you think I 'm gonna let that happen ? Now you said the future is always changing . - Are there changes by just knowing it ? - You can change it . Doesn 't mean it will . - Good enough . - What are you doing ? What are you gonna go do ? Gonna try to make a better one . Going after Carver doesn 't change anything . It doesn 't save me . It doesn 't save you . It doesn 't save her . It 's just a matter of time Cassie . If I don 't go to him , he 'll come for us . Emily it 's Nick . Listen . The Division sent a pusher named " Carver " to Hong Kong . I need you to find him . Just use that feed I gave you . I 'm sure his hands are all over it . We 're not open yet . I 'm not hungry . Henry Carver . Now . That 's a face I 've haven 't seen a long time . Sit down . Pushing action pretty good there . Give me one good reason not to kill you right now . Good . Your trying to get inside my head . Go ahead . See if you can push me before I can pull the trigger . Well , ten years is a long time to hold the grudge . My father would disagree . - Piece a shit . - Your father , I have respect for He took a stand with great integrity . Which more than anyone can say about you . - This is your attempt to ... - They gotta know this future ? I 've got twenty of the best watchers in the world Tracking every moment of this time right now . You die , Nick . You all die . Know who doesn 't ? Me . Are you sure about that ? Okay . Kira is our patient " Zero " ... And with her , we 're going to create an army - The world has never seen before . - I 'm sorry ? Am I suppose to care ? Fine . Fuck the jurydism . The girl will die unless she receives the necessary injections . And you 're not going to find it anywhere but with me . Maybe you care about her . Tell me something Nick . Her blood turned black yet ? No . Inside it 's running out . Why she keeping that away from you too ? I take that as a yes . You already know the ending to this story . You can only draw it in so many ways . I going to change it . You don 't believe that , do you ? Please . Don 't make me do anything to myself . Hurting you won 't change the future . Like how this future goes ... So , by killing him ? Victor ! I think I just save your life . No need to thank me . You should just start listening to me . You look like shit . - Where is she ? - 5A . Is she safe ? She 's sick though . Pretty bad . I need to ask you a question . What 's in the case ? It 's a drug . Some sort of psychic steroid that boost our abilities . Or kills us . He want me back . Because I 'm the only one who survived the injection . Tell me why I just drew a picture of me holding her shoe ? Is she okay ? What ? No , you got to be kidding me . - She 's dying . - Your not bringing me into this . You 're already in it . We need to know what key unlocks . Please . Cassie , how much does the Chinese know ? Whatever we do , it could be more . Their watchers are better than me . We know there 's a suitcase with a Division drug in it . - Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong . - Can you draw us away out of this ? We can 't change anything without her tracking us The second we do , she 's gonna see it . What do you mean ? She sees intentions . What we decide to do . I decide to cross the street So she sees me crossing the street ? What if nothing we did makes sense ? We just keep changing our minds . They didn 't know exactly what we 're gonna do . Will that throw it off ? It might be if we start to find the case . Whatever this key unlocks is being shadowed . Like I 've never seen before . It 's this way . That really narrows it down . If it shadowed , I won 't be able to draw it . It 's the building you see . I thought shadows weren 't suppose to be affected by watchers like Cassie ? Not . We 're not suppose to able to shade the entire buildings either . You wanted to see me ? I 'm going to need your help . Watchers from everywhere are tracking us . Carver , the Chinese ... Anything we think , we gonna do , they know about it . That 's why we all keep dying in Cassie 's book . Pardon ? You died outside the an elevator . But how we gonna make the future unpredictable ? By not knowing what we gonna do ... Until right before we do it . - A plan without a planning . - Yes , right . I 'll write letters to each of you . Giving you specific instruction . You don 't open it until I tell you . And the last letter I write to myself ... And wipe the memory I 've ever had written off . That 's why I need you to find the guy that wipe Kira . - Sure thing . - That sounds like a great plan . - Keeping a better one ? - I fine blind . Yeah . Cassie , give me one more drawing . I need to know the exact size and shape of that case . And that syringe . Our watcher said that the package is here now . Pa pa , I know what they are looking for . With this drug , we will become stronger . The girl will die unless she receives the necessary injections . You 're not going to find the stuff anywhere but with me . You die , Nick . You all die . You need the medicine that Carver has . I 'm not gonna watch you die . I 'll come back for you . I promise . When do I open it ? When you start to tell the truth . You know when to open this ? You sure this is right ? No . Nick . Take an umbrella , it 's gonna rain . You be careful too . You make us chase you half way across the world Then you let it had like Pinky Stein bring you in . - I 'm sick . - You 're sick ? You don 't know what you are . Victor , pay the man . Of course . I know I wouldn 't get paid yet . Wait here . Are you followed ? Never followed . Where is this guy ? - Which one ? - Yellow one . - The big one ? - Yup . Wu Chang ? Your here about the girl ? You 're the one that wiped Kira . Five years ago , a woman told me an American girl would come . That was two days ago , when she show . I have a job for you . Two hours ago , I wrote seven letters . I need you to erase the memory I 've ever having written . Seven letters , two hours of memories . The woman tell me those things . She did not pay for you , too . When you 're done , I need you to open this and read it . - I need a minute . - As you wish . Like ah ... Wake up and forget who I am . Am I ? Wait , wait ... No ... Go . Go . It 's all gone . The future has disappeared . I lost the connection . Sir , your credential , please . I 'm here for inspection . I want to know where the lockers are . The top floor , sir . You can find them up there . - Should I go that way ? - Yes . Okay , no problem here . The girl sent me . Thank you . Red . Right size , right shape . No problem . You better hurry . It won 't last long . / 4 . Hide . / Go home . Hello . Did you really think you could slip out of town with this ? Tell me . Was this worth dying for ? You die slow . My sister promised me that ... And the great deal of money . Do you know how many people in the world Would kill for this drug ? Now . Where is Cassie ? Get me back on my feet . You don 't seem to be reliable . You didn 't see that one coming did you ? Do you really wanna do this little girl ? I know where the drug is , more importantly . I know how you die . Do you wanna know what the tiger means ? The case is in here . See if that would make him love you . My note says it suppose to tell you The Division has Kira , 216 Butan Street It 's said all off on there , is everyone that complicated ?

But you were certain you be the one to survive the drug . I had to support you . After all , we we 're partners . Then you panic . Do you think you made it all the way here And eluded us for so long without any training ? That 's the Division in you , Kira . Now , let me help you remember . Now , let me help you remember . I 'm trying to draw something different , but I can 't . Somebody had to do how I die . It is a tiger . Serious ? I don 't know how , but I just know . I know I had to act like I don 't care Sometimes ... - I don 't wanna die . - Cassie . That 's not gonna happen , okay ? Just tell me that I 'm a crappy artist And I 'm wrong . You are a crappy artist and you are wrong . Listen to me . You already done more than enough for everyone . The only thing you gotta worry about right now is Keeping yourself safe . But how ? You just start walking , Don 't even think about where you 're going ... You just keep on moving don 't make any decision Any watcher can track . You come across some place safe ... You hide . Simple as that . I don 't know how , but I know this is gonna work out . Promise . No need to be scared . Trust me . It 's more like it . What you gonna do ? I can 't tell you . " Wan Chi Market " / One cup of English tea , sugar free . / - Two Wonton noodles . / - Very cheap . On sale ! / - Wonton noodles . / - It tastes pretty good . I 'm so happy . / Food delivery .

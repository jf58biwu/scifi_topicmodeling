 [ Man Narrating ] As the 2 1st centurybegan ... human evolution was at a turning point . Natural selection , the process by which the strongest , the smartest ... the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest ... a process which had once favored the noblest traits ofman ... now began to favor different traits . [ Reporter ] TheJoey Buttafuoco case- - Most science fiction ofthe day predicted a future that was more civilized ... and more intelligent . But as time went on , things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction . A dumbing down . How did this happen ? Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence . With no natural predators to thin the herd ... it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most ... and left the intelligent to become an endangered species . Havi ng kids is such an important decision . We 're just waiting for the right time . It 's not something you want to rush into , obviously . No way . Oh , shit , I 'm pregnant again ! Shit ! I got too many damn kids ! - I thought you was on the pill or some shit ! - Hell , no ! Shit ! I must 've been thinkin ' of Brittany . Brittany ? No , you didn 't ! - There 's no waywe could have a child now . - Mm-mm . Not with the market the way it is , no . God , no . That just wouldn 't make any sense . Come on over here , bitch ! He don 't care aboutyou ! Yeah ? Well , there must be somethin ' he likes over here . - She don 't mean nothin ' to me , baby ! - Clevon ! Oh , shit . It wasn 't me ! It wasn 't me ! Well , we finally decided to have children ... and I 'm not pointing fingers , but it 's not going well . And this is helping . I 'm just saying that before I have in vitro , maybeyou should bewilling to- - It 's always me , right ? Well , it 's not my sperm count . Yeah ! Yeah ! I 'm gonna fuck all y 'all ! That 's my boy ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Clevon is lucky to be alive . He attempted to jump a Jet Ski from a lake ... into a swimming pool and impaled his crotch on an iron gate . But thanks to recent advances in stem cell research ... and the fine work of Doctors Krinski and Altschuler ... Clevon should regain full reproductive function . Getyour hands off myjunk ! Unfortunately , Trevor passed away from a heart attack ... while masturbating ... to produce sperm for artificial insemination . But I have some eggs frozen ... so just as soon as the right guy comes along , you know- - [ Clevon Shouting ] [ Narrator ] Andso it went forgenerations ... although few , ifany , seemed to notice . But in theyear 2005 , in a military base just outside ofWashington , D .. C ... . a simple army librarian was unknowingly ... about to change the entire course ofhuman history . Come on , asshole ! Go on ! Take him to jail ! Hey , Bauers . This is Peterson , your new replacement . - Mywhat ? I 'm gettin ' replaced ? - Yeah , they didn 't tell you ? - No . - Some new assignment . They 're being all weird and hush-hush about it . I don 't want a new assignment . I tell Sergeant Metslerthat everytime . - I 'm good at this . - Good at what ? Sittin ' on ass ? No one ever comes in here . Yeah , I know . It 's perfect for me . No one bothers me . I can 't screw up . Ifl canjust staying here another eightyears , I get mypension . I 'm all set . Can you just get me out of this ? No way . Not this time . It 's coming from high up . Jesus . I don 't understand . Why me ? Every time Metsler says , " Lead , follow , or get out ofthe way , " I get out ofthe way . When he says that , you 're not supposed to choose " get out ofthe way . " It 's supposed to embarrass you into leading or at least following . That doesn 't embarrass me . Look , Joe . You don 't have a choice . You 're just gonna have to follow . Like , follow me upstairs , like , now . Right now ? Shouldn 't I train this guy ? I think he can figure out how to sit on his ass and watch TV all day . Let 's go . [ Man ] Gentlemen , meetJoe Bauers ... our first subject for the Human Hibernation Experiment . Now , as you know , throughout the years ... many of our best pilots , soldiers and military leaders ... often go their entire careers without ever seeing battle . With the Human Hibernation Project , we will be able to save ourbest men ... frozen in their prime , for use when they are needed most . Joe , here , is not one ofour best men . Mr. Bauers was chosen primarily for how remarkably average he is . Extremely average in every category . Remarkable , truly . The most average person in our entire armed forces . Additionally , he has no family , is unmarried ... is an only child , and both parents are deceased ... making him an ideal candidate , with no one to ask any nosy questions ... should something go wrong with the experiment . We hada little less luck in finding a female researcher 's dream within ourranks ... and were forced to look into the private sector . This is Rita . LikeJoe , she has no immediate family . Rita agreed to participate in this experiment ... in exchange for dropping of certain criminal charges and a small fee . We did , however , have to come to an arrangement with herpimp ... a gentleman who goes by the name Upgrayedd , which he spells thusly- - With two D. ' s , as he says , for a double dose ofthis pimping . U pgrayedd agreed to loan us Rita for exactly one year ... and keep quiet on the matter , in exchange for certain leeways ... with the local authorities in running his pimp game . First , however , there was the difficult challenge ofgaining his trust . Collins , could we skip to the technicals , please ? Sure . Let me just fi nish here . You see , a pimp 's love is very different from that of a square . Collins ! Fine . We 'll move on . It is a fascinating world though . Jesus , Collins . Yeah , that 's- - [ Clears Throat ] Anyway , the experiment in which these two subjects ... are to be placed into a dry freeze ... for exactly one year is set to begin tomorrow . As you know , this is highly classified . However , ifsuccessful , we believe humans can be stored indefinitely . So this is kinda crazy , huh ? - What unit are you with ? - Oh , I ain 't in the service . Oh , private sector . Okay . - So , uh , what do you do ? - A little ofthis , a little ofthat . Wow , that 's great . You know , I really envy people that can make a living that way- - doing a little ofthis anda little ofthat . I , uh , had a neighbor , Glen . He used to make chainsaw sculptures ... and then he 'd sell ' em at the flea market . Yeah . So , uh , you an artist or somethin ' ? - Uh , yeah . - You do paintings or- - - Yeah , paintings . - Okay , great . - Mm-hmm . - What do you paint mostly ? I don 't know , just ... people and fruit and shit . Wow . Well , must be great to be able to make a living doing something you love . [ Scoffs ] Yeah . It 's not all it 's cracked up to be . - [ D.oorOpens ] - [ Collins ] Who wants to go first ? Me . - [ Machinery Whirring ] - What the f- - Oh , hell , no . Uh-uh . Hey , no . You probably don 't want to do that with the I.V.s attached and all . - What 's the matter ? - Man , Upgrayedd didn 't tell me they 'd be putting me ... in no damn coffin with tubes and shit ! Oh , no , don 't worry about it . It 'll be safe . Trust me . Who 's Upgrayedd ? He 's my boyfriend . Man , how doyou know this shit 's safe ? These guys know what they 're doing . Don 't worry . They 've tested it on dogs and everything . What happens is , the drugs will kick in , we drift offto sleep ... we wake up in a year , you 'll be painting ' again . - It 'll be fine . - All right . Upgrayedd . That 's an interesting name . Is he Dutch ? See , ' cause I knew this , uh , Dutch exchange student . His name was Untgrad . Okay , my niggas , we 're almost set here . Just go ahead and lie down . Relax . [ Equipment Beeping ] Seeyou in a year . [ Narrator ] The Human Hibernation Project ... was one ofthe army 's most ambitious experiments ... and one of its most secretive . But it was not immune from human error . Freeze ! [ Groans ] Soon after Collins ' s arrest and the massive scandal that followed ... the base was closed . It hadn 't even been a year , and the entire project was simply forgotten . Things looked bleak forJoe , but they were even worse for mankind . As Joe and Rita lay dormant , the years passed ... and mankind became stupider at a frightening rate . Some had high hopes that genetic engineering ... would correct this trend in evolution . But sadly , the greatest minds and resources ... were focused on conquering hair loss and prolonging erections . [ Orangutan Chattering ] Meanwhile , the population exploded , and intelligence continued to decline ... until humanity was incapable ofsolving even its most basic problems . Like garbage , which had been stacked for centuries with no plan whatsoever ... leading to the Great Garbage A valanche of2505 ... which would set in motion the events that would change the world forever .

[ Flushes ] Yeah ! Wouldn 't shut up ! Come in here and not shut up . Yeah , you were like , " I 'm not shutting 'up , " and I was like- - [ Narrator ] Unaware ofwhatyearit was ... Joe wandered the streets , desperate for help . But the English language had deteriorated ... into a hybrid ofhillbilly , valley girl , inner-city slang and various grunts . - Joe was able to understand them ... - [ I ndisti nct ] but when he spoke in an ordinary voice ... he sounded pompous and faggy to them .

Why am I still here ? - Uh- - Goddamn , how does this time travel work ? - Please stand clear . - [ Policeman ] Freeze ! Hands up ! Don 't move ! - Put your hands up ! - Don 't move ! Freeze !

The I.Q. test you took in prison . You got the highest score in history . Brought to you by Carl 's Jr . Yeah , dumb ass , you 're even smarter than President Camacho . That 's how come he 's making you secretary of interior . Okay , so who are you ? I 'm the secretary of energy . He won a contest . Got to be a cabinet member . I 'm the secretary of state . Brought to you by Carl 's Jr . - Why do you keep saying that ? - ' Cause they pay me every time I do . It 's a really good way to make money . You 're so smart , why don 't you know that ? [ All Chuckling ] - He 's the secretary of defense . - Hi . And , uh , funbags over there is the attorney general . [ Whispers ] Hi . And that 's the secretary of education . He 's kinda stupid , but he 's President Camacho 's stepbrother . Still , he does a prettygoodjob , eh ? You know , I think there 's been some kind of mistake ... 'cause the test I took was real , real easy . I 'm not the smartest guy in the world . Okay ? Okay , even ifthat were true , I can 't be the secretary ofthe interior . - I don 't even know what it is . - [ SecretaryofState ] You betterfind out . - Sit down . It 's President Camacho . - Hey , hey , hey , yo ... I gotta take care ofsome " bidness , " baby , so I needy 'all to wait outside . [ Narrator ] D.wayne Elizondo Camacho , five-time Ultimate Smackdown Champion ... porn superstar , and president ofthe United States ... had called a special summit with the smartest man in the world . - So you smart , huh ? - No , no . - I thought your head would be bigger . - [ Muttering ] Goddamn . - It look like a peanut . - [ All Laughing ] Let 's getyou sworn in .

He would not only end the dust bowl and heal the economy ... but he would cure acne and carsickness as well . And ifhe didn 't ... President Camacho made anotherpromise . He would kickJoe 's smart balls all the way up to the roofofhis smart mouth . - And then , he would throw his brainy ass back in jail . - [ Shouti ng ] I should , uh , be honest with you , Mr. President . I don 't know how to be secretary of anything . I mean , I 've never even voted , actually . I don 't know what the secretary ofthe interior even is . Come on , scrot . Don 't be a pussy . It beats jail , don 't it ? Besides , you do a kick-ass job ... you get a full presidential pardon . - No jail time . [ Laughing ] - Yeah ? Fuck , yeah ! Now gimme a beer . Andgetyou one too . [ Laughing ] Shit ! [ Laughing ] Hold on , vato ! - Whoo ! - [ Engine Revving ] [ Laughing ] - Do somethin ' smart . - Yeah . Uh , okay .

Wait here , okay ? Wait there . Dude , this is trepidatious . You got me a room at the White House . Everyone gets laid at the White House . Everyone . - Yeah ? - Yeah . I 'm real glad you 're happy to be here , Frito , but I broughtyou here to help me . I don 't know the first thing about growing 'crops ... much less the goddamn " ecomony . " Econ-Economy . Let 's see . Growin ' crops- - No , I just need you to tell me how to get to the time machine . Oh , that 's easy . You go down by the museum and stuff . It 's , like- - It 's , like , by the museum ... sort of , but , well , actually , not really . More like- - But on the street . You go , um- - Wait . Let me start over . Okay , you know where the time machine is ? Hey.Just draw me a map , okay ? You still want the money ? Oh . Ifl had some money and a room at the White House ... - I would be like , " It 's mine , all night ! " - Listen . Cut it out ! Listen , I told these people thatyou were smart , okay ? - So act smart ! - Smart likeyou ? [ With Effeminate Voice ] " Oh , I gotta go to the time machine . I wanna go home . " - I don 't talk like that . - " I don 't talk like that . " Shit , I thought there was two ofyou . [ Laughs ] See ? [ Secretary ofD.efense ] D.oesn 't look that big , is it ? Okay . Let 's go take a look at those crops . Especially the ones , uh , you know , out around the museum area . All right ? Hey , come on ! Now , you either lead , follow , or get out ofthe way . All right ? Whoa . Did you just make that up ? Yes , I did . Now look ... I also need help finding this girl named Rita , like , immediately ... - and Frito will giveyou a hand with it . - Why ? Well , because , uh , you know , she 'd be an essential ... integral ... asset ... you know , for ourteam , forus to , you know , utilize . [ All Laughing ] Utilize her ! Utilize her ! [ SecretaryofState ] Utilize ! - [ Laughing ] - Hey , uh , but you 're gonna bring her here , right ? Oh , yeah . Butt first ! [ All Laughing ] - [ SecretaryofD.efense ] Utilize her ! - Okay . Dang ! May I approach your benches ? Uh , yeah . This sucks pretty bad . Frito , why don 'tyou come overhere and , uh , take a look at this ? Come on . Hustle overhere , buddy . I wanna figure this out . See , uh , just not a lot of moisture . Have you got the map ? - Oh , yeah . - Discreetly . - It 's right there . - I see it . I see it . Stand up with me . Yo , Mr. Secretary Not Sure . They found that whore you wanted . Hey , that may be how you refer to women in the future , but come on . No , sir . Turns out she charged some guy a lotta money and didn 't put out . D.on 't worrythough . We 'll get her out ... on a work-release whorin ' license as long as you 're doin ' her . Get your hands off me . What do you think I 'm gonna do , run through the field ? What the fuck areyou all staring ' at ? - Joe ? - That 's Not Sure , ma 'am . - Secretary Not Sure . - Secretary ? Secretary ofwhat ? Say , would you guys mind ifwe had a little moment together ? Alone ? You know , in the bushes ? Oh , man . [ All Laughing ] - Fuck her , Joe ! - Hey , you want us to come along , make sure she puts out ? No , thanks . I can handle it . Yeah . I thoughtyou was in jail . How 'd you get to be the secretary ofinterior ? Just keep walking . I 'll explain everything . Okay . Get ready to run . - What ? - Oh , goddamn it . Way to go , Frito . You know what ? Just make a run for it anyways . We 'll ask for directions on the way . No way . I spent the last two days looking for it . It ain 't easy to find . Damn it . I can 't go back to jail , and I sure can 't solve these problems . All 's I know is I better find Upgrayedd before he finds me . Listen to me . Upgrayedd cannot find you , okay ? It 's impossible ! - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah ! And even if Upgrayedd ... could somehow magically travel through time ... we got secret service guys with huge guns protecting us , okay ? So don 't worry . You 're safe . And you know what ? It 's none of my business , but when we get back ... you and Upgrayedd should seriously think about couples counseling , okay ? And you should also think about maybe finding an art managerwho 's not alsoyour boyfriend . Hey ! She 's notputtin 'out ? Uh , no , she is . We , uh--We already did it . Yeah . He was great . Okay . Hey , a couple of us guys were wonderin ' , uh ... ifwe 'd go family-style on her . Uh , yeah , probably not right now . We should focus on the crops . So let 's get back to work . Maybe later . What the hell is this ? - Tastes like Gatorade . - [ Rita ] Is that that Brawndo stuff ? [ Joe ] They 're watering crops with a sports drink ? [ Narrator ] Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator had come to replace water ... virtually everywhere . Water , the basic component ofall life ... had been deemed a threat to Brawndo 's profit margin . The solution came during the budget crisis of2330 ... when the Brawndo Corporation simply bought the F.D .. A ... . and the F.C .. C ... .. enabling them to say , do and sell ... anything they wanted . Joe didn 't know any ofthis ... but he did see a problem that he might actually be able to solve . - [ I ndisti nct ] - With his options running out , Joe took a bold step . He would not get out ofthe way . This time , he would lead . For the last time , I ' m pretty sure ... what 's killing the crops is this Brawndo stuff . But Brawndo 's got what plants crave . It 's got electrolytes . So wait a minute . Whatyou 're saying ... is that you want us to put water on the crops . - Yes . - Water . Like out the toilet ? Well , I mean , it doesn 't have to be out of the toilet , but , yeah , that 's the idea . - But Brawndo 's got what plants crave . - It 's got electrolytes . Okay , look . The plants aren 't growing , so I 'm pretty sure that the Brawndo 's not working . Now , I 'm no botanist , but I do know that ifyou put water on plants , they grow . Well , I 've never seen no plants grow out of no toilet . Hey , that 's good . You sureyou ain 't the smartest guy in the world ? - [ Chuckling ] - You wanna solve this problem . I wanna get my pardon . So why don 't we just try it , okay , and not worry about what plants crave ? Brawndo 's got what plants crave . - Goddamn it . - Yeah , it 's got electrolytes . What are electrolytes ? Do you even know ? It 's what they use to make Brawndo . Yeah , but why do they use them to make Brawndo ? 'Cause Brawndo 's got electrolytes . [ Narrator ] Afterseveral hours , Joe finallygave up on logic and reason ... and simply told the cabinet that he could talk to plants ... and that they wanted water . He made believers out ofeveryone . Joe didn 't know it , but the beloved electrolytes ... were salts that had been building up in the topsoil over the decades ... killing plants and leading to the dust bowl . As secretary ofthe interior , Joe ordered all crops to be switched to water ... promising that , over time , plants would grow and the dust bowl would end . He was on the fast track to a full presidential pardon . - Or so it seemed . - [ Al I Shouti ng ] Man , I hope somethin grows fast . Yeah . So we can haul our ass back home . Man . You really think those people would have starved to death ? I don 't know . I mean , how did the world ever get like this ? You know things are bad when they 're comin ' to me for answers . - It 's a weird feeling being smarter than everyone . - Mm-hmm . - I 'm not used to it . - Yeah . Me neither . You think Einstein walked around thinkin everyonewas a bunch of dumb shits ? Yeah . Hadn 't thought ofthat . - Nowyou knowwhy he built that bomb . - Yeah . Hey , Joe , listen . Those cops- - - Oh , hey . I 'm sorry about that . - No . No . They said that you got me a pardon . You know , ifyou hadn 't done that , I 'd still be in jail right now , so ... I guess I oweyou one . You know , you don 't have to sleep on the floor ifyou don 't want to . Oh . No . I 'm- - I 'm all right . Yeah . Besides , you know , I don 't think Upgrayedd would be too happy about that . You in bed with a stranger . - [ Snickers ] - Yeah . [ Laughing ] I know . I know . [ Laughing Continues ] [ Joe ] Yeah . Oh , boy . Oh , shit . It 's Upgrayedd . [ Joe ] Oh , shit . It 's not Upgrayedd . [ Narrator ] Given enough time , Joe 's plan might have worked . But when the Brawndo stock suddenly dropped to zero ... leaving halfthe population unemployed ... dumb , angry mobs took to the streets , rioting and looting ... and screaming forJoe 's head . An emergency cabinet meeting was called ... with the C.E. O. ofthe Brawndo Corporation . How come nobody 's buying Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator ? Aw , shit . Half the country works for Brawndo . Not anymore ! The stock has dropped to zero ... and the computer did that auto-layoffthing to everybody . - We 're all unemployed ! - You think that makes the " ecomony " suck ? - Why is this happening ? - I think it 's because we switched to water , but- - - You mean this is all your fault ? - What ? Yeah , this is your fault . This shit started happening when we switched to water ! Brought toyou by Carl 's Jr . Brought toyou by Carl 's Jr . Brought toyou by Carl 's Jr . [ Announcer ] Fox News . He tried taking water from toilets ... but it 's Secretary Not Sure who finds himselfin the toilet now . And as history pulls down its pants ... and prepares to lower its ass on Not Sure 's head ... it will be DaddyJustice who will be crapping on him this time . We now go live to Violence Channel correspondent Formica Davis ... at the Extreme Court with highlights on today 's trial . Thankyou , Velveeta . Well , it started offboring and slow ... with Not Sure trying to bullshit everyone with a bunch ofsmart talk . [ With Effeminate Voice ] Blah , blah , blah . You gotta believe me ! [ Normal Voice ] That part ofthe trial sucked . But then , the chief " J " just went off . He said , " Man , whatever . The guy 's guilty as shit . We all know that . " And he sentenced his ass to one night of Rehabi I itation . Hey , rehabilitation ? One night ? Doesn 't sound so bad . Not so bad , huh ? Here 's some highlights from last week 's Rehabilitation . [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Engine Revving ] [ Formica ] And who could forget that wonderful finish ... by Rehab Officer TylenolJones ? [ Chuckl i ng ] And tomorrow night looks even more better . Word is that Beef Supreme himself might come out of retirement . Wow . Thankyou , Formica . Soyou thinkyou can escape again likeyou did last time ? - No . They pretty much fixed that . - How ? They chained me to a big rock . - [ Rita ] Oh . - Yeah . Look , Rita , get Frito . Get him to takeyou back to the time machine without me . Don 't wait . No . You could have split on me before , butyou didn 't . Look , you wanna pay me back ? Just go back , okay ? Tell people to read books . Tell people to stay in school , you know . Tell people to just use their brains or something . I think maybe the worldgot like this because ofpeople like me . I never did anything with my life . At least you were an artist , you know ? - Sojust go back and- - - [ Guard ] Visit 's over ! And Rita , whateveryou do , keep painting , okay ? Good luck , Joe . [ Groans ] [ Announcer ] Okay , that 's five down and one more to go . Areyou readyfor a monster-truck duel to the death ? Yeah ! Let 's give it up for the Guitar Army . [ Rock ] [ Announcer ] Okay , we 're gonna do this shit . But first , to lead us in our Natural Anthem ... the star of Ow ! My Balls ! Hormel Chavez ! Thank you . Thank you . - [ Man ] Hey !

So , my car 's out front ... wheneveryou want me to take you ... to the time machine . Thanks , Frito . - Yeah . - [ Announcer ] I can 't hearyou !

Not Sure , get your ass up here , whereveryou is . [ Crowd Cheering ] Let me get that little peanut head up here . Yo . Yo . [ Laughs ] I have decided ... to make this man- - the man who solved all our problems- - I have decided to make him ... my new vice president . [ All Cheering ] Mr. President , thanks . That 's real cool ofyou , sir ... - but I can 't accept it , sir . - What ? Why ? - You know , I gotta get home . - But we still got all these problems . Look , you know , you 're just gonna have to solve ' em yourselves . - How ? - Think about it , you know ? You 're just gonna have to figure it out like we did with the crops . But how are we gonna figure out about the garbage " ambulanches " and the " comony " ? And what about the nuc- - " nucular " reactor in Florida ? I t 's broke and leaky and something 's happening . - I thought it was in Georgia . - Georgia 's in Florida , dumb ass . Hey . Hey , I know . Let 's put toilet water on it . Huh ? - Yeah ! - Good , good . That 's a good idea . - [ Minister ofD.efense ] Like we did on the crops . - Come on , vato . Hey , you can 't leave . Whatever happened to all that " lead , follow , or get outta the way " shit , huh ? I guess I just can 't get outta the way anymore , can I ? You know what ? - Forget about the time machine . - Yeah ! [ All Cheering ] That ride sucks anyways . Ride ? [ Male Voice ] Welcome to the Time Masheen . We are going to takeyou back , first to theyear 1 939 ... when Charlie Chaplin and his evil Nazi regime ... enslaved Europe and tried to take over the world . So you knew this thing was just a ride the whole time ? Yeah . You thought you could really travel through time , huh ? - Yeah , I guess I did . - Yeah . For the smartest guy in the world , you 're pretty dumb sometimes . - So why didn 'tyou tell us ? - ' Cause I like money . I 'm sorry . But ifit 's not a real time machine , there wouldn 't have been any money . You know , ' cause I can 't go back in time and open a savings account . Uh , uh , uh- - Yeah . Don 't worry about it . It 's okay . Well , I guess we 're stuck here . [ Male Voice ] But then an even greaterforce emerged- - the " UN . " And the " UN " un-nazied the world forever . And the " UN " un-nazied the world forever . [ Narrator ] And so , after serving a short term as vice president ... Joe was elected the president ofAmerica . Frito became vice president ... and Rita , the formerprostitute , became first lady . T oday I step i nto the shoes of a great man ... a man by the name of Dwayne Elizondo ... Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho . [ Narrator ] Under President Not Sure 's leadership , a new era dawned . You know , there was a time in this country ... when smart people were considered cool . Well , maybe not cool , but smart people did things ... like build ships and pyramids , and they even went to the moon . [ Man ] Yeah ! And there was a time in this country , a long time ago ... when reading wasn 't just forfags ... andneitherwas writing . People wrote books and movies , movies that had stories ... so you cared whose ass it was and why it was farting . And I believe that time can come again ! [ All Cheering ] [ All Chanting ] Not Sure , Not Sure , Not Sure ! [ Narrator ] Joe and Rita had three children ... the three smartest kids in the world . Vice President Frito took eight wives ... and had a total of32 kids- - thirty-two ofthe dumbest kids ever to walk the earth . Okay , so maybeJoe didn 't save mankind ... but he got the ball rolling ... and that 's pretty good for an average guy . I ' m gonna go fi nd this ho .

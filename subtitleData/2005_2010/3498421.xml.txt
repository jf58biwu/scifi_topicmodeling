 NARRATOR : Welcome to the bloody age of the guillotine . What a pitiful sight . Pitiful . You poor , poor man . Don 't be scared . It 'll soon be over . And then tomorrow , after a good rest , I shall kill your wife . Don 't , please ! NARRATOR : France was a hell of a place to be a couple of centuries ago . The country was in the grip of revolution . MAN : Citizens , don 't be frightened ! Good citizens of France . Take what is rightfully yours . NARRATOR : The king had already been killed along with hundreds of aristocrats . The whole country was being turned on its head . Power now lay in the hands of bureaucrats and politicians , who , every day , were becoming more ruthless . They ordered that anyone declared an enemy of the new regime , rich or poor , be shot or taken to the national razor . But , with upheaval , came opportunity . For one young refugee from Corsica , this was the chance of a lifetime . This is the little-known story of how Napoleon Bonaparte first emerged from obscurity . How he risked everything and set out on a path that would see him crowned Emperor of France . MAN : This town has been captured and then liberated for your good . To give you chances you never had in your life before . The infection is being cut away for your benefit . Don 't wait for this scum . They stopped you living a life , your own . SOLDIER : Point , level , fire ! MAN : France is yours now . Better get off . Visit me . You might get to see something . - A few fireworks . - Can we please ? Depends on a carriage , but ... Course , we 'll try and get there if we can . - We 've got the laundry . - Come along , Caroline . Now . Monkey . We 're so proud of you . We all are . Come on , Letta . Hey . - Promise not to get shot . - Hush now . Leave him . I want to say something . You see what 's happening here . Like this country 's on ... On fire . - I know it 's brutal , but ... - There 's just so many people . Strangers . Not us . Everything 's changing . Everyone 's gonna get their chance , Napoleon . That 's why we came to this country . You must make your name here . For all of us . This fire , it can burn people . But it can shine on them , too . Get them noticed . God knows , it 's worth the risk of getting burned . MAN : Any man who holds thee second in his heart will see that heart ... Take care . MAN : To Captain Napoleon Bonaparte , by order of the Committee of Public Safety , Paris . You are hereby promoted to Commander of Artillery for the district of Toulon . The fighting around Toulon has been fierce and infantry losses heavy , but the importance of this region cannot be overstated . - Get back ! - Have you seen my hat ? Get back ! The revolution is under assault from all sides by traitors and their foreign allies , but nowhere is the threat greater than at Toulon . The English , invited in by French counter-revolutionaries , occupy both the city and its port . From here , they could overrun the entire south of France . Toulon must be retaken without delay . You are to report to the headquarters of General Carteaux at Ollioules . The Spanish are pressing up from the Pyrenees , Austrians from the east , English , the north . And we 've got God knows how many tied up in the guerrilla war in the Vendée . But retaking Toulon is still Paris ' main concern . Well , it 's not your normal rebelling city , or we 'd have had the place by now . It 's the English . WOMAN : We 're here , about four miles west . I 've deployed battalions of infantry to retake the areas round the city . Deployments which have been immensely successful . We 've got back the entire surrounding areas . And as you can see , we 've begun punishing the collaborators . Everything 's under control . Just another siege now . Citizen , your colleague , General Brunet , thought this was just another siege , which is why we 're having him executed . We 're not military men , but this could finish the revolution . Lose Toulon , its naval base , we could lose France . Now , I suggest your wife shuts her mouth and you tell us exactly how you plan to get the English out . Hold the area . Wait for reinforcements . And storm the city walls with a full-scale , frontal , infantry assault . Jesus . Sir . General . - Madame . - You don 't salute me . - Bonaparte . - Of course . I know you 're planning a frontal assault , but there 's another way . You can be in Toulon tomorrow . The English don 't care about the city . It 's this , the harbour . That 's why they 're here . Whole English fleet 's there . Make the harbour useless and they 'll leave the city . Now , we only ever use the artillery to support the ground troops . What about the other way around ? Why don 't we use my cannon to attack their boats ? Down the peninsula about there , halfway down , there is a patch of high ground . Occupy that . I 'll bring the artillery to there and there . Attack all of their ships . The harbour will be useless . Toulon will fall without a man being lost . Infantry support artillery . - Step away from the table . - 500 men could do it . - You don 't even have any cannons . - I 'll get more and request volunteers . CARTEAUX : Be quiet . How many sieges have you been involved in , Bonaparte ? I took Avignon , we took Marseilles , with full frontal assault . Cannons breach walls , soldiers take cities . It works . - It did work ... - What you 're suggesting but that was against local rebels . English soldiers is trained and the city ... - That 's enough ! " Soldiers is trained " ? - WOMAN : He speaks like an ape . - They all like you in Corsica ? - Sir , why are you being like this ? Me , General , you , junior . An immigrant whose father blagged him into military school . I heard the story . Get out . Budge up . CARTEAUX : Marmont , get yourself in here . - What did you do before ? - Oh , a fishmonger . We 're gonna build an offensive battery here . SOLDIER 1 : Did Carteaux order this ? Did Caesar ask permission from the Senate before vanquishing Gaul ? " Vanquishing . " We 're gonna build cover . And behind it , I want placements for two cannons . Not these . 24-pounders , 9-foot barrels . Sir , you know we don 't actually have any 24-pounders . We 're not allowed on that peninsula . That doesn 't mean we have to sit on our hands . In the name of liberty and equality , we are going to raid our own forts up and down this coast and requisition their cannon . Any retired artillery men within 80 miles , retirement 's over ! We 've got 24 hours . I want every basketweaver , blacksmith , horse , carriage-maker in that battery park . Sir ? What battery number is this ? No numbers . From now on , we 're naming them . When this is done , you can tell your kids you didn 't fight in Battery Number 10 , but the Battery of Revolution . Hey ! You , there ! Help . - Not him . Leave him . - Who asked him ? Where are the extra men from ? Word 's gotten round about your growing cannon collection . General Carteaux watching the action tomorrow ? Military men don 't run this siege , politicians do . I 've invited two People 's representatives , Citizen Barras and Citizen Fréron . - Oh , shit . - NAPOLEON : You 'll be fine . General Carteaux 's never gonna take us seriously . We 're going over his head . Target 's drifting 60 yards further offshore , sir . Good windage . Elevate 1.24 inches , one degree , 50 minutes , same line and charge . Ready with the , er ... - MAN 1 : Ready with the hurdles . - Hurdles . MAN 1 : Drop the hurdles . MAN 2 : Hurdles . Load it again and run it out . MAN : Fire ! Fire ! Where are the charges ? We need more charges ! She 's firing ! A miss . Well short . - Volunteer to record . - Quick , write . For the record , 48 hours since Napoleon Bonaparte took command of the artillery and already he is firing on the frigate Aurora . A hit . A hit coming ! At least I won 't need to sand the ink . They 're moving out of range , sir . They 're turning away . Where did they come from ? I 've quadrupled the size of our artillery . We still need ammunition . But once we have it ... - How old are you ? - He 's 24 . I 'm in Bauset for a few days . Visit . - I 'd be honoured to . - Oh , Mallet and Denon . Jacques ? Mallet ? Please , no ! Last public holiday , their families were seen having their children baptised . Please ! Please ! Push it right in . Junot ? I need you to copy a letter . Two letters , they 're to go off tonight . Who to ? My family . They 're to meet me in Bauset as soon as they can . - Of course . - With a borrowed carriage . The other is ... To Paris . The Committee of Public Safety . WOMAN : Letta ! - WOMAN : Letta . - It 's not me . Just pull yourselves together . You all right ? Good luck . Come in , Bonaparte . Wait back there . Sir , I have a plan to topple Toulon . - You saw what we could do . - And who are these ? Are they your lieutenants ? These are ... No . This is my ... Some of my family . - We 're refugees from Corsica . - Oh . " Lieutenants . " So we came to support the revolution . But it 's hard , you know . Sacrifices . And who 's this ? Yes . This is my mother , Letizia . This is Paoletta . Elisa . Letta . You have an exceptionally attractive family , Citizen . They 'll be in Marseilles till Toulon falls . You 're based there . Your acquaintance would help them . - When will that be ? Toulon . - Could be soon . I have a plan to take the Caire Peninsula around the harbour . I 've sought permission to execute my plan . Five hundred men could take it in a few hours . Sought permission ? From whom ? Paris . I sent my plans to Paris to the Committee . I 'm waiting for a reply . You wrote directly to Paris without going through me ? Sir , I thought ... I 'm sure my son assumed that nothing would be ordered without your approval , Citizen Fréron . I 'm sure he did . Now , as a humble citizen , I must wait for their response . I look forward to seeing more of your charming family in Marseilles . FRÉRON : Dangerous . Comfortable ? Hell , I can sleep anywhere . It 's like when you sleep under the cannons . The guys reckon you keep one eye open on them . I do . Think it 's possible to sleep underwater ? Using a tube or something ? No ! - I 've got to talk to the General . - CARTEAUX : Get him in here ! In here ! You wrote to Paris behind my back when I expressly ordered you not to ! What did they say ? Why should I tell you ? What makes you think ... They 've agreed . We have to move now . The English have landed on the peninsula . They 've landed ? We 've got to get the men on high ground before they do . - What sort of deployment ... - We need 1,000 men . Send them now . Give him 1,000 . Make that 500 . He promised Paris he could do it with a handful . Let 's see , shall we ? Any of that coffee left ? NAPOLEON : The English are on the headland . We have to move fast . There aren 't enough men . There are only five ... - Who changed the order ? - General Carteaux , you Corsican bastard . I 'm sorry . FRÉRON : Are they ripe ? My brother 's wage doesn 't stretch very far . Then his fondness for letter writing is risking more than just his own future . - How old are you ? - 13 . He 's right , you know . My friendship could help your family . I hope we can be friends . Perhaps you 'll come up . Refreshments . All of you , of course . Too much of this can go straight to the head . Be warned . I don 't mind . Is it true you led the executions in Marseilles ? - Have you ever seen one ? - Um , no . - My brother won 't let us . - Never seen blood flow like it . Come here . Do you bleed ? Revolution requires sacrifice , Paoletta . Remove anything that threatens the greater good , however precious . Now ... You can 't imagine life without your finger . But watch . Your brother ordered an attack on the peninsula this morning . It failed . Is he all right ? Is he all right ? Please . See ? Finger quite forgotten . You 'd happily lose it to protect him . You 're right to be concerned . Oh , God . - It 's in the ... What 's it called ? - Hold it . We reckon only about half of the 500 made it back . Just outnumbered . A few were taken prisoner . NAPOLEON : Sir . God created man in his own image . It 's the other way around . That 's why we got rid of him . We are the supreme being . We can judge ourselves . We can show compassion . And we can punish . - Sir . - Don 't say a word . This Corsican ignored explicit orders and then what do you get ? He wrote to Paris behind your backs , behind my back . Let me explain . He lied to me . - I requested ... - That 's insubordination . - You can 't allow it . - You 're addressing a senior officer . He promised me 1,000 men . 1,000 ! And he , maybe his wife , - sent deliberately half that ! - Lies . Lies ! I am not a liar . I can find ... Could it be ... - CARTEAUX : You may quote ... - Could it be that you deliberately - threw lives away ? - He told Paris , everyone ... - That you sabotaged the revolution ... - A handful of men . ... in order to punish me ? - We sabotaged it ? The English have taken the high ground . They know taking the peninsula is the only way . FRÉRON : " The committee should understand that with just a handful of men " I could end this siege in a matter of hours - " with no French blood being spilled . " - Those are your words . That was before the English landed . Taking the peninsula is still the only way . - It 's over . - You can 't listen to him . You got us involved ! In Paris , my name is being used alongside the words " failed attack " . We are not men that you will ever screw with , Bonaparte . I am not a man you will ever screw with . - Monkey . - Sorry . Ammunition convoy was late . LETIZIA : It 's started . She doesn 't want to be here . - Just tell her she looks nice . - You look nice . ACTOR : Down and stay down , wretch ! You are pressed men that would live free . You beg forgiveness ? I say ... What do I say ? MAN : Kill him ! - ACTOR : You made livestock of them . - You 're a major . Monkey , they 've made you major ! That 's ... It 's not what you think . They 're looking for scapegoats . Executing a major makes a bigger splash than a captain . I 'm getting the blame . ACTOR : You filled your belly with the food of my children . And you beg forgiveness ? What do I serve ? You lived and you touched ... WOMAN : Neckline ? Filthy . ACTOR : And you beg forgiveness ? I say ! WOMAN : Corsicans . Worse than the Italians . Would you ? You condemned men to the fate of their bloodline , no matter their worth . What did I say ... Bastards ! Bastard ! Scum ! I can 't do this . I just can 't . We haven 't got ... anything . Not another hat between us . Just ... Everything is just filthy . You . Wallowing in self-pity . Don 't you dare ! It 's all of us going down and we can 't do anything about it . Who was it ? Threatened you . Fréron ? - You have to get rid of him . - I can 't get rid of him , Mum . Then win him back ! Go over his head . But do something . For God 's sake , do something ! You all right ? I will not work under General Carteaux and I insist that he be removed . - Insist ? - Remove him or remove me . Bonaparte , that 's a mistake . You know , I 'd not killed anyone until a year ago . I was a journalist . You will be dead by nightfall . Paris know about this ultimatum . I wrote . So ? So , execute me and in the eyes of Paris , you 'll be putting your name to Carteaux 's plan , a frontal assault , and when it fails ... What makes you think you 're so much better than all the rest of us ? That 's not the way to go about things , Bonaparte . Make your decision . You will remain in Toulon . General Carteaux will be replaced within a week . But ... I shall also be appointing a more senior artillery commander here . The situation now requires it . - You will be relieved of command . - I 'll be what ? - Stanislas , shouldn 't I be ... - No . And your sister , Paoletta , fine girl . I shall be seeing her without her chaperone . I don 't suppose Paris will object to that . I told you not to screw with me . Now walk away . Walk away . It 's cold . Come and sit with me ? Play with it . Not at me . Look at the doll . Undress it . My brother thinks you 're stealing something from me , because I 'm young . If I didn 't want to be here , nothing can make me . You 're not doing anything wrong . I 'm not afraid of you . MAN : Get off ! Get off me ! SOLDIER 1 : I 'm gonna miss that woman . SOLDIER 2 : The new boss is here later . SOLDIER 3 : If his wife 's a dog , then we 're blaming you , ratty ! SOLDIER 1 : Did you ever see her bits ? SOLDIER 2 : I did . ALL : Bollocks ! Oh ! Oh , look , how charming . General Doppet , can I ask you what your plans are for Toulon ? Well , the revolution has been awakened to danger and has been called to defend freedom . And , erm , we will bring our enemy to justice and justice to our enemy . Right . And the peninsula ? The men are calling the English positions on the high ground " Little Gibraltar " . You won 't know , by the way , that I 've changed my name . Periwinkle . Periwinkle Doppet . The revolutionary calendar is a wonderful thing . Every day of the year now has its own name . Did you know ? Well , in order to show my commitment , I 've taken the name of my birthday . Periwinkle . And , um ... And there it is . I 'm going to go . You get back to your mother . What do you see in an old man like me ? I don 't know . Boring question . DOPPET : How would it be if the enemy did not hate us ? They hate our equality . They hate the opportunity that is available to all men no matter who he is or where he 's from . Apparently , he used to be a dentist or a doctor . NAPOLEON : Now he 's a puppet . Did you just make a joke ? Morning , tossers ! Oi , keeping warm ? Got your wife over here . She 's got a mouthful right now ! Tell her to sit on this ! - Who 's that ? - One of our boys . Infantry . They captured him during the ... No ! They 're killing them ! Sir , let us go . We 're going . We 're attacking Little Gibraltar . Angry men are gold . You couldn 't stir this up . Use it ! - Uh , I don 't know . - We could end this now . Sound the attack . - Sir , the attack 's already started . - Attack ! Come on , get a musket ! NAPOLEON : Get them to spread out ! Get the skirmishers out front . Get them ready to charge . On my word . Charge ! It 's an attack . Where 's their defence ? They 've only one cannon open ! SOLDIER : Where 's the other cannon ? NAPOLEON : They 're not ready . We 've got them . They weren 't ready ! - BARRAS : There are no coughs . - Coughs ? BARRAS : The cannon . The English aren 't firing . Good old Doppet . Your fellow 's gonna take it . Retreat ! Fall back ! Fall back ! - SOLDIER : Retreat ! - No ! No ! There 's only one cannon open ! Why are they ... My bridle 's dirty . Please clean it . Now ! That useless bastard just cost us Toulon . He 's a dentist , for Christ 's sake , who 's frightened of blood ! - Sir , please . - You encouraged the attack , Bonaparte . We 've been told you misled the general . - Stanislas ... - Stay out ! - Stanislas ! - Paris will blame Bonaparte . I 'll report that the general merely followed ... No . I 'll not tell them that . I 'll not say that . Your general ... Look at him . I 'm sorry , Stanislas . You 've got to get the revolution off our battlefield . Come on . Toulon 's become too important . Politics starts battles , it doesn 't win them . How ? Give me back the artillery with a proper soldier in charge , not some " Periwinkle " . Even one from the old regime . It 's winning the fight that matters . Paoletta ? I wanted to surprise you . You did . Where have you been all day ? Did you see my brother ? Stanislas ? Please don 't come here . I 'll get word to you when I can see you again . Stanislas . Rabbit ! I like the name . Little Gibraltar . I don 't know how my predecessor allowed this to happen . The English clearly believe the peninsula is the key to Toulon . And I agree with that assessment . You must be Bonaparte , commander of generals . General Dugommier . Well , Little Gibraltar . The English have turned it into a fortress . Twenty-six bronze in all , a dozen of them 24-pounders . But that 's not all . Canister shot . For those of you who don 't know , they fit in the barrel of a cannon . What sort of range ? They 'd tear apart anyone within 500 yards of the fort , 40 , 50 men at a time . I don 't suppose you have a suggestion as to how you 'd tackle the fort . Shut up ! Junot . The fort ? A night attack , but spread out . Three columns of infantry . A pinning attack on the right , one in the centre and one on the left along the shore . To stretch their defences . And these canisters , do you have a plan for them ? - I do . - Of course you do . Two batteries , and for 48 hours before the assault we bombard the fort , burying whatever cannons we can . But whoever is the first in the fort must knock out whichever cannons are left . Unless they do that , it will be a massacre . When the fort falls , we bring the bronze to here , here ... Finish the job . Something tells me that if I don 't promote you in this situation , you will merely promote yourself . Well done , lad . I 'll appoint the three column leaders in due course . MAN : Well done . - Do you mind ? - No . Sit down . The barrage has started . We attack in 48 hours . The revolution thinks it best if Bonaparte stay behind for the attack . - I 'm afraid I can 't accept that . - I 'm afraid I don 't care . Exactly a month ago , we executed the queen of this country . It doesn 't matter what for . She didn 't do half of it anyway . Now , you are old and wise enough to know that if we can do it to her ... I know you . You 're fear . That 's all you are . You create terror and milk it . Laugh , but you also feel it , my God , of men like Bonaparte , don 't you ? Men who , even from a thousand paces , could never be mistaken for mediocre . " No man greater than the next . " Except for Napoleon Bonaparte . Watch your lip . I 'm sorry , lad . That 's the world we live in now . I 'm heading the reserves . Fréron . Sitting in the back , I won 't see a shot ! Oh , slippery ... Why is he doing this ? Why is he doing this ? I 'm not here to ask you why you won 't see me . I promise . Why are you doing this to my brother ? I 'll tell you why I 've been avoiding you . It 's because I 'm conducting an affair with someone else . A woman . Someone more mature , more suitable . Rabbit ... Someone who doesn 't call me these ridiculous names . - Stop it . Why are you saying this ? - She 's from a family of power . Your family are immigrants . But I 'm in love with you . Life isn 't about what one person wants . Her family have influence . I have important work . So help him . Give him his chance . We can be together . You don 't understand . I can 't . I just can 't . What I believe in , everybody equal , and he threatens all that . He doesn 't mean to , but he does . You used to frighten me . You 'll get your chance . Fréron won 't be in charge next time and they 'll give you your chance . - It 's not going to happen , Mum . - Don 't say that ! Don 't ! I 've given things up for ... - France is changing , it is . - Nothing 's changing . Power isn 't being handed out like bread . It 's being stolen , like it always was . Do you think in 50 years , 100 years , the world will be any different ? There 'll always be kings , Mum , even if we don 't call them that . Then do whatever you have to . LETIZIA : I love you . MAN : Hold the line ! Close the right flank ! Smokers out and I want silence . SOLDIER : Sir , they 've opened up their 24-pounders . NAPOLEON : Stay close . On my mark , start counting . Now . One , two , three ... NAPOLEON : Take your fatties , oilier the better . Cover your locks , leave them on . Don 't get excited , you 're not going . That 's your shame . " Daddy , is it true you saved the nation at Toulon ? " " I 'm afraid not . I was in the reserves . " - Now ? - 53 seconds . Going wrong . All three columns have turned in too early . We may have to commit the reserves . Sir , but General Dugommier hasn 't ordered ... They 're floundering , for God 's sake . This is it , mate . Get my horse . Sir ... You could be court-martialled for this . What about your family ? Please , sir . I 've got no choice . Looks like history 's made room for us after all . Called your name . If any of you don 't feel like going , that 's fine . I do ! I 'll take this fort alone ! And destiny will be waiting ! Shots will bounce off me ! Cannonballs will swerve with fear ! Not one of you needs to take this fort , but I absolutely insist you come with me and watch me take it ! You will come with me and watch me take it ! Wolf tail ! If I go forward , follow me ! If I retreat , shoot me ! And if I 'm killed , avenge me . Avenge me ! Junot , when the first canister shot hits us , start counting . Oh , no ! Junot , keep counting ! Five , six , seven ... 50 men , on your feet ! We 're gonna run at that cannon ! You 're joking ! - On your feet ! You will trust me ! ... 16 , 17 ... And you will run ! ... 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ... Oh , Jesus ! ... 49 , 50 , 51 ... - NAPOLEON : Drop ! - 52 ! 53 ! We 're under it . We 're under the cannon ! Covers off ! Fatties off ! Come on ! Take that cannon ! Shut them down ! - Junot ! - Here , sir ! We 're taking that cannon . He 's loading . Get the blood off this . Enjoy this . It won 't last . Come close . You 're right . Glory is fleeting . But obscurity lasts forever . NARRATOR : With the fort taken , Napoleon 's cannons emptied the harbour . Within hours , Toulon finally fell and the revolution was saved . Within weeks , Fréron publicly acknowledged his relationship with young Paoletta , but Napoleon forbade them to marry , and in 1802 posted him to the remote island of Santo Domingo , where he quickly died of dysentery . Letizia gained almost mythical status , and before she died saw six of her children join the royalty of various European countries . But all this was down to one man . Just six years after Toulon , at the age of 31 , Napoleon became ruler of France , and later crowned himself Emperor .

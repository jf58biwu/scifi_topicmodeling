To the parents of Aeden Bennett 6906 Howard Avenue San Carlos , CA 94070 Well , now you 're not going to have dinner for a long , long time . 911 , what you help To the parents of Aeden Bennett 6906 Howard Avenue San Carlos , CA 94070 - Hi . - Hi . Sorry . No , I 'm sorry for the confusion . No , it 's probably my fault . It 's been crazy around here lately . Oh , yeah , I know how that goes . - I got a wife and four kids at home myself . - Right . Listen , I have to get back to work , but I 've worked with you guys before , So I 'm just going to trust you to lock up if that 's okay ? Sure . Can 't be in business 70 years and not be trustworthy , right ? Well , I guess not . Come on in . Okay . So we had a pipe burst a couple of weeks ago . Had that fixed , but now , we can 't seem to get any hot water . So I 'm just wondering if those two things might be related . That might have something to do with the water heater . Yeah , that 's what I was thinking actually . - I 'm not the plumber . - What happened ? Where 's my husband ? - I shot him . - Where is he ? Well , you see , that 's a good question . Because he seems to have disappeared . 23,10-20 . 23 at home , go ahead . Got a 10-71 at 9088 elm . Shots fired , code 3 . Check , I 'm on my way . I don 't think he 's here . - Could I just call my work and tell them ... - No ! What do you want ? I want to eat . I want some food . - Okay . - Do you have an apron ? Uh ... - Yeah . - Put it on . I said put it on . Your name is aeden . Aeden bennett . What did you do wrong , aeden ? Why are you being punished ? Are you deaf ? I 'm talking to you ! - I-I don 't know . - You don 't know ? Your dad locks you in your room all day , for what ? For getting a good report card ? You must 've done something wrong . - Maybe . - So what 'd you do ? - Did you torture a cat ? - What ? Push a girl down the stairs ? Take a gun to school ? Are these hard questions ? Answer me ! I told him I hated my mother . I told my dad I hated my mom for leaving me with him . We cloned your brother 's hard drives and recovered data at work and home . I thought you only had a warrant for his house . Here you can see a list of searches he made off his browser . You confiscated his work computer ? Your brother 's search results yielded a very compelling menu of subject matter from legends Like dylan mccleen to faces in the crowd like diana bloom . Diana bloom was a passenger on a chicago / san francisco flight in 1975 . She was pregnant . She delivered the baby onboard the plane that was forced to land in stockton . A local photographer caught me of the passengers getting off the plane . Okay , a guy that looks like my brother . Now , take a look at these images from a security camera at sfo 's gate 37a this past september . These are passengers boarding flight 1680to portland . You may also remember that was the flight that was turned around Because your brother got off the plane before it took off , Although there 's no evidence to date that that ever happened . Now , these two men not only look remarkably alike , they 're wearing the same clothes . Don 't you find that a bit curious ? So far , I haven 't seen any evidence that my brother 's broken any laws . Not unless you count the laws of physics . Do you have any idea what you 're witnessing here ? - What this means ? - What this means ? What he knows and when he knows it could change ... At least it could make someone very , very wealthy . So then , at the end of the day ... This , this whole thing is all about money . Is this just about dan or is it a hobby of yours ? They always need cash . " They " ? It always trips them up . I , I need to talk to your brother . Why ? All right . We 're done here . Thank you for your cooperation , inspector . Oh , that looks really gross . It 's infected . - I need to get up . - No . Give me that . I know that face . What face ? The face that my dad makes before he 's gonna hit me . Am I right ? You wanna hurt me . - Do you know why ? - Why ? Because when you grow up you 're gonna try to kill me . Maybe even hurt my family . How ... how do you know that ? I just know . I - I don 't even know your name . You will . But then there 's a chance you might make something of your life . If you let me help you . What if I don 't ? What if I don 't change at all ? Then I 'm in big trouble . Here . Take it . It 's your dad 'S.He 'll kill you . That would be good for you , wouldn 't it ? - You have to call me an ambulance . - No . I can 't do that . It 's okay . It 's okay . Get me out of this house . This is an ambulance . Can you go faster ? I - I get it . I get it . Don 't go off mission . You tell them to call off the dogs . If I only had their ear . I wanted to kill that kid , liv . - But you didn 'T ... - That could be a fatal mistake . Or you passed a test and learned a lesson , dan . I mean , that could be what this is about . I don 't care what happens to me . I just don 't want anything to happen to my family . Neither do I. In fact ... When I went to your house , I saw pictures of you and katie and zack , your life now . Maybe you 're meant to be together . I mean , think about it ... I die . You mourn . She comforts . You and katie ... You don 't come together unless livia and dan come together first . She filled a vacuum I created . So , you could say ... Your mission was to get us together . I 'm starting to wonder . Where 'd he come from ? I don 't know . But he 's messed up . - Dropped the investigation ? - Yeah . - Why ? - I don 't know . But you were right . He was rogue . And I just wanna say I appreciate you flagging it . Your brother can be a pain in the ass , but he has his good moments . Jack ? Jack . Jack ? You okay ? Yeah . Thanks , hugh . Weirdest family ever . Hey ! Hi , jack . - Who are you ? - It 's me . No . I 'm sorry . It 's not . - I went to your funeral . - You deserve a long explanation , But if I give you one now , it may cost your brother his life . Which do you want ? - What are you talking about ? - Your brother 's been shot . - Shot ? - It 's bad and I don 't know where he is ... This is a scam or some practical joke that 's gone ... - Listen to me ! - What the hell are you guys doing to me ? Dan has been shot . - Where is he ? - I don 't know . I mean I think he 's in the city . I think he 's here now . And based on that , what am I supposed to do ? Find him . Just stand there . I 'm gonna look at you . I thought you were hungry . Starved . I ... Haven 't been to the store . I was gonna go today . You make lunch for your son every day ? Yes . That 's good . That 's important . I have , uh , some lunchalots . Lunchalots ? - They 're sort of pre-Made ... - It 's not making lunch ! That 's cutting corners . Did your mother make you lunch ? Once in a while . What happened to her ? She left . Where did she go ? She , um , ran off with the plumber . I , I came home from school one day and she left a note . And , uh , two sunshine hydrox cookies . - That 's terrible . - Well , the old man , he ... He didn 't take it very well , and then he took it out on me . Why are you here ? What do you want from us ? I don 't want you . I want your husband . What did he do to you ? He took six years away from me and my emily . And if I can 't take those years away from him ... Then I 'm gonna take away someone he loves . Hello ? Hello ? Anybody home ? Door 's open . No ! Please , don 'T . You just shot an fbi agent . Well , hey , really stepped into it now , haven 't I ? So , how did I get so sick so fast ? You developed a bad staph infection . I started you on vancomycin . It 's a broad spectrum antibiotic . I 'm feeling better . Thank you . Were you given an antibiotic when you came in the first time ? - Ampi-Something . - Ampicillin ? That 's 20 years old . We would never give you that . It wouldn 't put a de in today 's virus . - That would explain it . - I 'll be back in a sec . - Dan - Hey . Jack ? - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - We have to get out of here . - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! - I can 't get a signal . - Dan ... - I have to call katie . - What the hell is going on ? How did you find me ? Livia told me . Jack , we have to get out of here . Okay . Look who 's calling . - Hey ! - Bennett . Hello , dan . I knew you got out of the house , but how ? - God , if you 've hurt her ... - Oh , no . She 's-She 's fine . She 's , um ... She 's making me lunch . So , listen , here 's the deal , dan . I - I take it you 've , uh , called the cops , and they 're out there ? Not true . Yeah , okay , well , if I see anyone near this house , you sleep alone starting tonight . - I haven 't called the cops . - That 's a lie . - What 's going on ? - I haven 't because I 'm still in the house . Get up ! Get up ! Okay , here 's my deal . You let her go . You take me instead . I 'm not talking to you , dan . I 'm not talking to you until you show yourself , okay ? I - I 'm gonna count to three , dan . - No ! - One . - You let her go first . - Two . - Just let her go ! - Three . I 'll kill you , I swear ! Just testing , dan . What the hell 's going on ? - You talking to someone , dan ? - I 'm talking to you . I 'm serious this time , vasser . If you don 't show yourself in the next 30 seconds , this next bullet 's going to find brain tissue . Just let me talk to her . Just let me see if she 's okay , please . Say hello . - Hello . - Are you okay ? Has he hurt you ? - No . - Listen to me . Don 't ask questions . Just ask him if he wants ketchup on his sandwich . Ask him if he wants a pizza sandwich . - Ten seconds . - Just do it . - Five seconds . - Wait , wait , please . Do you want ketchup on your sandwich ? Wait . What did you just say ? You ... you said you were hungry . I was wondering if you ... If you wanted ketchup on your sandwich . I make a good pizza sandwich . How could you know that ? Nobody could know that . All right , dan , you have now five seconds . I 'm here . I 'm all yours . Just let her go . You 're not hurt . Don 't worry . You didn 't miss . This is all your fault , dan . - You turned me into this . - I did ? All I wanted to do was just take a couple of kids and give them a decent home . Just let her gO.We can talk . The punishment did not fit the crime , dan ! Was prison that bad ? Yes . But I mean , worse than spending your childhoodlocked in your room ? Someone has been perusing my psych file . Get out of here . - I 'm not going . - Go . - Get out of here . - No . Just think of zack . Close it ! I don 't think this is about your dad abusing you . I think this is about your mom leaving . I think you 're mad that your mother left . That she didn 't love you enough to take you along with her . Oh , come on , dan . You don 't think I haven 't heard this from at least 50 court-Appointed shrinks ? No , because I betyou didn 't tell them . Why didn 't you let your lawyer file an insanity plea ? - Because I 'm not crazy . - Exactly . Because you think you 're normal . That 's too bad because if you had copped to insanity , you might have gone to a mental institution instead of prison . Now ... Now , you 're either going to die from a lethal injection , or my brother over there is going to blow your head off . Now , do you remember a man who came to your house when you were a kid ? Man who was bleeding . He 'd been shot . Remember that ? You took care of him ? No one knows that . You remember that you gave him a shirt ? No . No ! No ! You 're trying to make me think that I 'm crazy . - That 's not true . - I 'm not crazy ! That 's not true . Now , The only question is , do you want your last minutes on this earth to be about killing one more person , Or do you want to prove that there 's still one shred of humanity within you ? Because I know that there is , ' cause I saw it ! I don 't want them to lock me up again . Tell them the whole story . Tell them what happened to you . Hey take him . You okay ? I 'm sorry that it took me so long to come around . Hey , jack , you had a steep hill to climb , you know ? Is it always like this ? Welcome to our life .

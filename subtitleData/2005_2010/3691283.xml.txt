 Previously on Warehouse 13 . Years ago , I swear you said you were just a simple professor . You left out the top-secret Warehouse full of madcap ? You 're the breach . Knock knock . Your brother Joshua visits you and tells you he 's not dead ? He 's stuck . Help me bring him back . Thanks . For not giving up . Claudia learned a great deal about the Warehouse , which could become problematic . You know what the options are . And this , and this . What artifact did that ? Or is that the artifact ? It was created by a little-known sculptor Walter Burleigh and it was stolen late last night from a high-end ... auction house in New York . But that 's not the issue . The issue is how this thing was stolen , because ... I 'm trying to figure out why after I just got back into this world , you want to shove me out the door . Because I didn 't spend half my life try to save your life so you could surf the net and watch youtube . Excuse me for trying to catch up on current events and the state of the world in the last 12 years . We 're working . We 're working right here . I 'm sorry , but apparently I have to find a job . Don 't know exactly what I 'm gonna put in that little gap in my resume . - What got you there in the first place ? - You ! - What ? - Don 't you have something to do ? Like stay out of prison ? And don 't you have to write me a full technical schematic on how you cracked my Warehouse ? - It 's upstairs . It 's almost finished . - Well then , I want you to finish it , and I want every redirect and every backslash . Go . Now . After that , you 're going into the Warehouse and you 're gonna re-wire what you unwired when you broke in . I 'd like to unwire you . The patter of little feet . All right , so , Artie , somebody boosts an ugly sculpture . Why does that involve us ? Okay , what is significant here is how this thing was stolen . I mean , this theft was ... impossible . There was a high-end alarm system , eight-inch thick walls , sealed vault . So one second that sculpture was there , next second gone . But it 's still just a well-executed art theft . I mean , it doesn 't automatically shout " Warehouse " , does it ? Things rarely shout " Warehouse " . They usually whisper : " Hey , that 's a little odd " . That 's what they do . I could be wrong . It could be nothing . But I 'm probably not wrong . Last time I was wrong was 1987 , June . Stop right there . That . I want to hear more about that . Not a chance . Go . Here we go . Going . Go , go , go . You know I love New York . - A great town . - It is , yeah . So I was just thinking maybe you guys could kick down some tickets to a show , or ... - Well , it depends on the show . - Really ? No . Get out of here . Show . Like you 're even gonna have time for a stupid musical . - Or that I 'd even pay for it . - Off Broadway 's not that expensive . Projet-SG ( 1.00 ) Carruthers ' auction house prides itself on security . This theft has us stumped . Video surveillance shows nothing . I 'm assuming you use an electronic lock that records all activity . It says door never opened . - Who 's selling the piece ? - Private estate . He decided to auction after he was approached by two interested parties , both with deep pockets . - When is this auction scheduled ? - It was for today . I hate to ask , but would you mind ? You know , maybe one of these interested parties hates competition . Which would mean that said party has an artifact that lets them pull off an impossible heist . Or the simple answer , an inside job . She does bear scrutiny . Follow me . Yes , ma 'am . - She 's out of your league . - How do you know what my league is ? Not that I ask for them , but I 've got season tickets . That 's good . I like it . So the thief takes one piece . - Was it the most valuable one in here ? - Far from it . - But there 's no accounting for taste . - I don 't know . Some things are just classic . Would you come here for a second ? Why don 't I stay here in the vault and look for anything " warehousey " , and you go check out those two interested parties ? Wouldn 't things go quicker if we just worked together ? Well , not if you 're on a date . Look , this way we can cover twice as much ground , and maybe you 'll even get done in time to take , skirt girl to a show . Two interested parties ? - I 'll get their info . - Great . - I 'll go with . - Batter up . Gilbert Radburn . Yeah , I 've seen your name on a few buildings . Good . That 's why I put it up there . What can I do for you ? You were interested in the sculpture that was stolen , the Burleigh ? I was . And as you might guess , I 'm not fond of losing . - What 's the secret service 's interest ? - How it was stolen . Which was ? You mind telling me where you were last night ? I have no need to steal . Sometimes it 's not about stealing , it 's about conquering . Like putting your name on a building . - I was with friends . - All night ? This is the city that never sleeps . You want names ? Yes , please . That would be swell . Also , why the Burleigh ? - What 's so special about it ? - Eye of the beholder , agent Lattimer . Eye of the beholder . - I 'll get you those names . - Thank you , sir . - What 's up ? - You should get back here . You got something ? I found something behind one of the crates , but it 's easier to show and tell . - What is it ? - You 're not gonna believe this , but ... I smell fudge . I 'll be right there . - What are we talking about here ? - Well , it 's right here . You can see it . Right ? What the hell ? Easy . Pete , no . No . Artifact behavior usually requires a human element , right ? - Just be careful . Okay ? - Okay . Oh , my God . - Check it out . - It 's crazy . Okay , you see this ... is one of those artifacts that I 'd really like to keep . Pete , put it in . Hey rocky , watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat . Now that 's cool . - That 's what I thought . - What ? That pinching causes pain ? No , I know that . But the feather , it only works up to your elbow . So not enough to get in and out with the sculpture . Which means that this is only part of the artifact . It 's not the whole thing . At least that narrows it down . We 're looking for an arts-dealing bird that walks through walls . Like Artie always says ... Never rule anything out . Show me . - Looks Native American . - We think it fell off something larger , a ceremonial object , a walking stick , a peace pipe maybe . Or a bird . Any guess as to who this thing belonged to ? Maybe one of the two guys who wanted to buy the sculpture , - we haven 't interviewed one of them . - Radburn 's too rich to risk it . He could outbid Donald Trump . I think we can rule him out . Never rule anything out . Okay , the second guy 's a rich dude . His name 's Jeffrey Weaver . Is that the son of Alexander Weaver ? Artie , who is Alexander Weaver ? Yeah , was . He was an extortionist , a real estate swindler , and a ravager of cultures . Not a nice man . Now deceased . And ... yes . Son Jeffrey ... lives in New york , so ... look , unless the acorn fell very far from the tree , watch your backs . Which one are you ? Let 's see . Is it that one ? Oh . Geez . Chill , sparky . How 's it going ? You mean are you scared I 'm gonna burn the house down ? Emergency exits are clearly marked . You think my concern for you is insincere ? I think you should pass me the cable shears . Those . So ... anxious to get on with your life ? Such shocking insight . Did my aura tell you that ? You 're certainly pushing Joshua . Only ' cause he needs it . You do have a thing for him . - You 're changing the subject . - You brought him up . Now that you 've saved him , your life 's work is complete , and that scares you . So you 're forcing your own need for a purpose onto him . Genius . And all done without a couch . How much do I owe you , Dr. Freud ? If Joshua accomplishes great things , then your sacrifice is justified . But you 're also afraid of being alone . Truly alone . It 's okay if I don 't like you , right ? Of course . But you do . - Mr. Weaver will be right with you . - Thank you . Call the cops . Crime solved . - It 's not what it looks like . - No ? Because it looks like you 're in possession of stolen goods . Take a closer look . That 's not the one that was stolen . There were four in the series , each named for one of the four elements . This one is fire . The stolen one is wind . - Check with the auction house . - How can you tell ' em apart ? You 're a trained expert with a scrupulous eye for detail . Or you read the brass plaque on the base . - Jeff Weaver . - Myka Bering . Pleasure . You mind telling us where you were last night ? Hosting a charity event for the children 's hospital in New Orleans . Rich , good-looking , likes kids . Who 's on a date now ? Okay , you said that there were four sculptures earth , wind , and fire ? Love those guys . Rock , wind , and fire , actually , and water . Right . It 's the artist 's tribute to Native American creation myth . - Native Americans ? You into that stuff ? - It 's an interest . You wouldn 't happen to be missing a feather , would you ? Maybe off something that lets you walk through walls ? What 'd you just say ? You got a lousy poker face there , Jeffy . New Orleans is , what ? A three hour flight away ? You 're still on our suspect list . Lacell , get in here . Hold it right there . Don 't move . - Let me see your hands . - What is it ? This dude was at Radburn 's construction site . - Yeah , he was giving me the stink-eye . - It 's all right . His name is Lacell . He works for me . We 'll decide when it 's all right , okay ? He also works for Radburn . It 's ... It 's complicated . Okay , wait . You work for Weaver and Radburn ? Look , Lacell 's not the problem . If what you said about someone walking through walls is true , the sculpture isn 't safe . You think they 're coming after this one next , don 't you ? We 're standing right here . I think we got it covered . Thank you , but I can provide my own protection . That 's not an offer , okay ? If somebody 's walking through walls , the United States government needs to know who and how . All I can tell you is that this sculpture is the next target , so please let me move it to a secure location . Okay , well , hold on . What 's that , badgey ? Okay . Sorry , Badgey says we stay with the sculpture . So wherever it goes , we go . No . Don 't touch that in the middle of the game . - With whom ? - Myself . White 's backed into a corner by black . I 'm waiting for a eureka to save white . Been waiting a while ? Three months . - Why ? - Claudia was looking it over . - Noticed you were in a bit of a pickle . - She noticed I was in a pickle . - Where is the little demon ? - She 's in there . She 's got work to do . She 's taking a break . She 's been working very hard . I hate that look . Claudia needs a home . This is not the Humane Society . She 's not staying here . - Mrs Frederic 's getting antsy as it is . - I 'm not suggesting she stay here . You can pull strings . MIT , Caltech . She needs a challenge . She needs people . - She 's got Joshua . - And Joshua 's on his own path . Yes , they 're both brilliant , but he 's a researcher , and she 's a doer . - She needs people like her . - Brash , rude , anti-social , impulsive ? We 're discussing Claudia , not you . See , that 's kind of a low blow . You 're so brash , rude ... - What are you doing ? No ! - Yeah , yeah , yeah ! Check . I 'll be damned . Maybe , but I 'm not one to judge . White beats black in nine moves . - Is the sculpture okay back there ? - Yes , it 's fine . I 'm fine too , by the way . Thank you for asking . Would you tell chief leadfoot to take it easy ? And how much longer till we reach the airport , anyway ? Is everything okay ? Stop the truck ! Are you okay ? Look at me . I need an ambulance right away . Hey , partner . How are you feeling ? Sore . Everywhere . Need cookies . You 've been out for a while . Remember anything ? I had my molecules rearranged , and got shoved out ... the side of a moving truck . That about sums it up . Not surprisingly , it gives you quite a headache . You know , I told Artie what you said about the buckskin coat before you passed out . And the creation myth . He 's doing his thing . Yeah , I don 't get it . I mean , this guy could be robbing Fort Knox . Why the sculptures ? Guess that 's our little puzzle , isn 't it ? The pretty boy . What is he doing here ? Jeff got you a free , multi-point inspection . Make sure all your parts are where they belong . - Jeff did . - Yes , Jeff did . He owns the hospital , or built it or something . Well , that 's handy . - He asked me to dinner . - It 's 3 : 00 A.M. - Cafeteria . - Big spender . - But I said no . - You should go . - No , I should stay here with you . - No . - I mean , Pete . - Myka . This guy knows what 's going on . Go for it . You know , use your feminine wiles . Smile . You 're pretty when you smile . I am ? What does that mean when I 'm not smiling ? Kind of frightening . Head injury . Nurse . Something I said ? I was just gonna come tell you . Here I am . Yeah , you were right . I have to go . Zero to 120 . I didn 't mean today . I was just looking for some ... forward momentum . Yeah , well , Artie made a few calls . And there 's a position at CERN . I should take it . It 's once in a lifetime . You 're going to Switzerland ? Smashing atoms ? Like you said , I can 't spend the rest of my life listening to Springsteen and surfing the web . If an interdimensional rift can 't keep me from being in touch with you , you think a few thousand miles will ? Well , you better . 'Cause I think I 've demonstrated I will hunt you down . Come here . Come on . Pete 's fine , but someone could get hurt . Where does that buckskin coat come from ? Is it connected to the sculpture ? There are hundreds of these Native American creation myths . I know . I still think that the feather , however , gives us our best clue . Anyway , the feather was predominantly used by the Delaware nations , and also by the ... By the Lenape tribe . They 're the ones who sold Manhattan to the Dutch for 24 bucks worth of arts and crafts . - Not a great deal . - You had to be there . And according to Lenape legend , the world was created through the spirits of four elements . Four . Fire , which gave us our soul . Wind , our breath . Water , death . Fascinating . And rock , which have the w ... Rock gave the world ... solidity . So someone has a buckskin coat that manipulates solidity . I think that this whole thing could be a pattern . Because if there are artifacts that control the other elements , and somebody were to acquire those artifacts , that somebody would have immense power over ... The world . - At the risk of sounding dramatic . - That 's never stopped you before . That 's true . Mama ? Pete , what took you so long ? Listen . Jeffrey Weaver . I think that that guy needs a second look . Myka 's taking a look at him now over dried turkey , mushy vegetables , and tapioca pudding . - Okay . You 're still in the hospital ? - I got pushed out of a steel truck . - I 'm recuperating . - Yeah , well , recuperate later , because while Myka 's keeping Weaver busy , I 'm gonna need you to toss his apartment . Why steal his stuff from himself ? Is Weaver our guy ? Tell me what you find out , and I will let you know . It 's very romantic . I had Verna turn up the steam tables . - It 's all about atmosphere . - Well , you sure know how to wow a girl . It 's my best move . What made you join the secret service ? It was either that or prison . I 'm kidding . What about you ? I mean , what is it you do exactly ? Accrue interest . Re-invest . Try to do something good with it . - That 's a nice life . - Well , it depends on how you got it . - Your father . - My father , yeah . And you don 't wanna follow in his footsteps . Is that it ? I wanna erase his footsteps . What ? I 'm trying to decide if I 'm sitting here with a good guy or a bad guy . You know who was in business with Radburn years ago ? The other guy who wanted the sculpture ? That 's right . Jeffery Weaver 's father . And both those guys tried to push really hard at that time to sell them , all four of the sculptures . - What do they do ? - I don 't know . I guess , something happens when you put all four sculptures together . - My best guess , something ... - Bad . Bad . Something bad . - You find anything at Weaver 's yet ? - No . I don 't know . This place is clean . If he 's the guy with the coat , he probably ... - Come on . - What ? - Probably nothing . I 'll call you back . - Wait . What ? You got to be kidding me . What a hack . Bingo mania . What are you really after in all this ? And don 't tell me the government needs to know . I 'm here for the coat . And , yeah , the government actually does want it . There are certain things that just shouldn 't be out in the world . True . But you , you 're only interested in the sculptures . Why ? They 're not that valuable . I think things that were created together belong together . Whoever 's doing this , and I haven 't ruled you out yet , is also collecting them . What happens when the four sculptures are together ? Seriously , Jeff , you should tell me , before somebody ... Just give me a second . - Is everything okay up there ? - Yeah , I 'm at Weaver 's . What ? What are you ... The guy 's got a secret room that 's a shrine to Burleigh . He must have bought up everything the guy touched . Whatever 's going on , your boyfriend 's neck deep in it . I 'll wrap this up then . So we should probably head upstairs , huh ? You know , I 'd really rather go back to your place . You know , it 's funny . I usually like it when a beautiful woman says that . That is funny , because I never like it when my date lies to me . You know , I don 't ... Burleigh was married to a Lenape woman . The sculptures are some kind of a ... key to a sacred , underground cave . - To a sacred what ? - A cave . It says that it contains four offerings to the spirits of creation . Somehow , he hid the directions to the cave in the sculptures . So those four sculptures , see , they 're a map . If you put the four sculptures together , maybe they ... they tell you where this cave is . Yeah , but how , Artie ? We 're missing something . Mr. Radburn , we found this man trying to break in . It 's Lacell , right ? What do you do for me , Mr. Lacell ? Geological surveys , sir . That 's right . You see what 's underground , don 't you ? And yet here you are , lurking very high above ground . Find anything interesting ? No , sir . You 're not a very good liar , Mr. Lacell . And you work for Mr. Weaver . Don 't waste your breath with denials . - Was he wearing it ? - Yes , sir . Let me have it . Tell me about this . It 's nothing . - My father gave it to me . - Don 't you mean your uncle ? As I said before , deception is not your strong suit . Walter Burleigh was your uncle , wasn 't he ? Why do you think that I hired you ? I had hoped you would lead me to the place . Your uncle hid clues to the sacred cave in his art . What 's this ? Water , rock , wind . Well , that 's helpful . Now I know how to arrange the sculptures . Wait for me outside . But what then ? How does it work ? How will they lead me to the place where the objects are hidden ? I don 't know . Give that back . You have what you want . Do you want to leave here alive , Lacell ? Is there more ? The truth is in the dawn . What does it mean ? I don 't know . The truth is in the dawn . - What does it mean ? - I don 't know ! I don 't know . I suppose you didn 't know . The truth is in the dawn . The truth is in the dawn . I don 't know what that means , but it 's written all over Burleigh 's notes . What 's written ? Dawn . This ... I mean , I don 't know . Creation , maybe . Tony Orlando and ... Creation ... - Or destruction . - Yeah . Look , Artie , how much of this stuff do we really believe ? Enough that if he 's looking for a cave , it 's better that we find it first . I would agree with that . Your partner 's already got me covered . - You 've got some ' splaining to do . - So where 's the code ? Gilbert Radburn beat me to it , same way he 's been trying to find the cave . - What cave ? - Underground , sacred . Check it out . We have to stop him . Like you said , there are some things that should not be out in the world . Yeah , well , what about that big guy that works for the two of you ? Lacell is Lenape . He wants to save the cave too . He 's been my eyes at Radburn 's digs . He hasn 't checked in . Something 's happened . Okay , so we have to find this cave before Radburn does . Well , if he 's got all four sculptures , he could be there now . We 've got all of Burleigh 's notes right here . That hasn 't helped me solve it yet . True , Mr. Weaver . But ... you 're not me . And now we need to find the location of that cave before Radburn does . The truth is in the dawn . Of course . It 's a map . Thank you . So Burleigh stopped taking notes when he got close to finding the cave . It 's like he realize the stories were true and stopped writing anything down . I think it may be enough because I found all these old maps , and I ... Knock knock . I wish you wouldn 't do that . God ! Not funny . Hang on . I just came by to grab my tools and then I 'm hitting the proverbial road . I 'm thinking Vegas . " Really ? Vegas Claudia ? Remember , always hit on 16 , never on 17 . " There 's gotta be a Lenape settlement here somewhere and it 's gotta be somewhere safe . Yeah , and they 'd look for a place with special properties . It 's gotta be somewhere safe . So ... No , this is not ... what-hey , hey ! Dude , have you considered matching these against magnetic ley lines ? No , you don 't ... One runs right along the east edge of the island . - Right there . - This is the south ... An underground cave in Manhattan , huh ? If no one 's run into it ... In all these years , then we can eliminate everywhere where they 've dug for major utility junctions ... and subways . - This looks right . - Indeed it does . Guys , I think I 've got it . I 've got it . It is Lower East Side . Corlear 's Hook . That is ... that is just south of the Williamsburg Bridge , and it 's right near the water , and it 's gotta be away from the subway lines . And Claudia pointed ... out ... the ... Radburn 's building there . He 's been digging everywhere that Burleigh focused using new construction to cover his hunt . Then he 's close to finding it . - We 're heading out . - Yeah , okay , feel free to hurry . All right , I need to get right here . Right next to this cave . - How long will that take ? - We can blow it in five minutes . I need the contents of the cave to be intact . Nothing can be disturbed . Contents ? Well , if it 's a surgical blow , I say we blast right here next to it and go sideways the last couple of feet by jackhammer . Just get me next to that cave . I 'll take care of everything else . Let 's go . Fire in the hole ! Your site 's just 18 inches the other side of that wall . - Let me get two guys with jackhammers . - No one comes here , you understand ? It 's true . It 's all true . The water of eternal life . He shall have the power of nature herself . - Gilbert Radburn . Where is he ? - Down . But I 'm getting out of here . Let 's go . He shall have the strength of a hundred men . And he shall harness the strength of the Earth . You kinda got your hands full , don 't you ? Don 't , Gil . You don 't know what you 're dealing with . You 're too late , Jeff . This is what I was meant to do . - Nut bag . - The nuttiest . Okay , Radburn , drop the arrow . Put it back , Gil . It 's not for us . Not for you , Jeff . You 're weak . And so was your father . Listen to me . You don 't know what you 're doing . The fourth element completes the transformation . Then nothing can stop me . How fitting that this place should be your tomb . No , no , no , it 's not meant for you . They 're meant for the man who 's strong enough to use them . - Knock knock . - Oh , God . Don 't do that ! That just never stops being funny , don 't you think ? Oh , never . What are you doing ... What happened with Vegas ? - It was too easy . - You didn 't . Just a little pocket money . Shouldn 't you be in college ? With people your own age ? Artie , I 'm not my own age . Come on . Writing English papers and going to frat parties ? Bor-ing ! I mean , at least here , you know , there 's ... - There 's a challenge . - That there is . You up for it ? Question is , geezer ... are you ? Oh , you are so out of your league .

I have some experience with this problem . I 'm sorry . But , listen , um , I want to discuss something . - You can 't stop me . - I 'm not here to stop you . There are government interests that want to keep control of what is happening here . They have decided to have you involved . But it is not why I want you . I want you involved because ... you 're a good scientist . And I respect you . Which you demonstrated to me by framing me for plagiarism . I pointed out that you had managed to do something with almost no resources that we failed to do with tens of millions and the united states military . You tagged the creature . Why should I work for you after what you 've done to me ? Because you will be present for history .

That way no drugs can be found on their property or on any property belonging to them . to watch their stash . do you ? Jenny ! Jennifer ! How many times have I told you to stop seeing that little punk ass ? I swear to God . Is he meeting you here ? Is he meeting you here ? Ma 'am ! I know this girl . you spoiled little bitch ? Do you do domestic complaints officer ? Can I make a domestic complaint against my spoiled little stepdaughter for making me wanna beat my own brains in ? It 's her real mother 's fault .

Chet ... They 're exactly like you asked . These ain 't just forgeries . This is full service . You 're in the system and everything . Collect welfare with ' em if you want . We might have to . so I 'm feeling the price was right . Maybe you 'd have gone another ten gs . Uncle Enrique will be proud . So I miss the next family barbecue . Charlie ... you okay ? out of it all night . I 'm good . I 'm fine . I just ... I had a rough call . Some guy on meth . want me to take a look at that ? I 'm good . I 'm good . - You sure ? - Yeah . Love you . I love you too . Carlos was right . 000 wasn 't that much money . a chance . You can 't put a price on that . I was never eager for that new life to begin . no story .

Informer . Certain words I know and don 't forget . Are you selling people out ? Enrique ? Okay . Okay . I was in Lompoc many years ago . On a federal gun charge . - You said you never ... - Three weeks . Only three weeks . And you made a deal ? You talked ? I gave information on my cellmate . and drove her from Oregon . He told me ... he told me where he dumped her . And ... yes . But that was all . That was all I gave . I lied to you . a man doesn 't ... you know ... Colaborador . It 's another one . - It means the same thing . - Why would you do this ? Did you hear what he said ? We don 't know . We don 't know . He was possibly lying . Possibly ? You just executed him on possibly ? He had a family ! Why would you do this ? Cause you wouldn 't . How do you know what I would and would not do ? You don 't know me . You don 't know me ! And you don 't know my son . Not John . Not my John . You don 't know what I would and wouldn 't do . I don 't even know what I would and wouldn 't do . I wake up this morning and you tell me ... I don 't know anything anymore . I don 't even rememberwhat my name is . Sarah Connor . where are you from ? actually . It 's a pretty good size city . 000 . Go to Kansas City often ? Lawrence is about 50 miles east of Kansas City . 25 miles west . - I knew that . - What about your father ? Your father . Kansas ? Your father 's dead . He was a police officer . He died apprehending a criminal . I know that . My dad 's always a hero . And he 's always dead . Did you go out late last night ? why ? Motion detectors . I thought I heard a beep . Probably her .

And who you 're with . Mom . What ? Never mind . Agent ? yes ? That I did not have my ear to the street ? I believe I may have something of interest for you . but of great interest . El Finito will not disappoint . all students . Class schedules will be available in Cahuenga Hall at 3 : 30 . Know thyself . John once told me it 's inscribed on the front of the Temple of Apollo . know thyself and thou shall know all the mysteries of the gods and of the universe . " That 's quite a mouthful . My version is this . Know thyself because what else is there to know ? People hide secrets . Time is a lie . The material world can disappear in an instant . It has and it will again . Ms. Baum . Our identities change . how we act and speak . We 're shape shifters . There is no control . No constant . No shelter but the love of family and the body god gave us . And we can only hope that that will always be enough .

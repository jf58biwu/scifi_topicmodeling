 Hey ! I get to make a call ! Like most kids ... I used to play hide-and-seek in my neighborhood . Best place to hide was an old oak barrel behind the Sutters 'garage . I used to climb in and pretend I was John Glenn ... orbiting the Earth in Freedom 7 ... and I never got found . But I did discover that after about an hour or so ... an old oak barrel can get pretty cramped and lonely . Just like the life of an astronaut . So , Rollie didn 't call me , and I didn 't call him . And I think makeup sex is probably a long shot . I guess that 's what happens when the three-hour rule passes up here . Nothin ' . - Sorry . - All right , guys . So , Form 24 today . We are - T - minus 23 hours until the Venus landing and Zoe 's walk . What ? Not doing my job isn 't gonna make this thing go away . - Zoe , you 're under orders to rest . - It 's just a 20-minute walk . In 460-degree weather . - You need to conserve energy today . - Fine . Donner , Mission Control wants you to run the landing simulation . - Everyone else , T-1 standard . - Why can 't we just say business as usual ? - Because we 're astronauts . - Oh ! - Good morning , sunshine . - Morning , Steven . I 'm okay . I 'm sorry . L - I got a little overwhelmed yesterday . - But I 'm okay . - Good . Now that we 're all okay , let 's get going . If you need help running the sims in the lander , I 've been helping Paula all week . I 've spent some time in the landers too . I think I can manage . You rest up . Ted , I would love to do my space classroom on the Venus suit today . - Any objections ? - I don 't . But Mission Control does . You 've been ordered to have a psych eval ... with our good doctor . - How are they doing ? - They 're rattled , Eve . Now , we trained hard , but not for this . You did . You just didn 't know it at the time . So you are going to make history tomorrow . We made history on Mars too . Ted , we are doing it right this time around . - What if we 're not ? - If we 're not - If we 're not , then I was wrong ... and we have wasted billions of dollars , 15 years - And lives ! Eve , lives . Walker and Sharon . And Zoe , Donner - Ted , that is not going to happen . We 're gonna be okay . I developed the halos that they sell at Merkman Cinco 20 years ago . We have never , in clinical trials or active use ... ever had hallucinations ... caused by the halos . Well , maybe one batch went wrong , and I.S.O. Got it . There 's thousands of halos in a batch . We sell the things to prisons , to priests . - So the press release from I.S. O. - - Is a lie . It 's a total fabrication . But you 'll have to get somebody from I.S.O. To corroborate that . And why do you care ? It 's my retirement , and it 's my grandkids ' college fund . And I get one percent of all sales . - Kim . Where 's Goss ? - No idea . You know , you 're lucky that the cop that picked you up ... washed out as an ASCAN back in ' 43 , because he called me . Your blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit , Rollie . Is she okay ? If that girl dies , you 're looking at vehicular manslaughter . That 's 25 years , no parole . Mike , just tell me . Is the girl okay or not ? She 's in a coma , but holding on . Oh , God . What the hell have I done ? Uh , I-I have to talk toJen . No , you don 't . You are not calling Jen . In fact , Jen is not gonna hear anything about this . And you are gonna sit there silently ... while I figure something out . You 12 were lucky enough to get the first shift for sensory deprivation training . This is how we find out who can handle the pressure ... of being alone in space and who can 't . What happened to " There is no ' I ' in ' team " ' ? This is how it works . You 're in the tank until we pull you out . Could be a halfhour . Could be two days . You can expect periodic noises . We don 't want anyone napping . Why is he looking at me ? Feel like he was looking at me when he said that . Listen up . This is a requirement , people . No one goes any further in the program until the exercise is complete . Is that clear ? We 'll start in 10 . Dude , this is it , man . This is totally it . What are you talking about ? Man , one of the old A.I. ' s told me that after sense dep training ... everybody gets laid . Yeah , man , it 's something about being alone , and then needing ... to-to not be alone . That doesn 't sound like it 's particularly scientific . - Doesn 't need to be . - It 's not . Don 't crush my dreams , Doc . Guaranteed sex tonight . Guaranteed sex tonight . Don 't leave me hanging . There you go ! Hey , mamacita . So , this sensory deprivation thing - Handsome , vulnerable , kind of broken . You targeting Mintz to help you blow off a little steam later ? Don 't be ridiculous . I 'm gonna be sleeping alone ... - in my own little bed tonight . - Amen to that . Said the bitter space nun . What ? Me , bitter ? Come on ! Not even a word of support ? What is wrong ? Nothing . I 'm fine . Really . Come on . This is gonna be like spending the afternoon in a Jacuzzi . Yeah , exceptJacuzzis are in open air ... with other people and with delicious beverages ... - with tiny umbrellas . - Okay . Then once we get through this , we will go to Major Tom 's ... and we will consume delicious beverages ... with tiny umbrellas in them . - Deal ? - Deal . Wass , take one . Weston , two . Schilling , three . Barnes , four . I hear tonight can 't help but be hot . Can you do me ? - Sorry ? - Zipper . - Are we still on ? - Uh , for tonight ? Yeah . - I 'll see you at Tom 's . - Great . So I 've got room to spare in mine , ladies , if anybody gets lonely ... wants to chat , you know ? That 's where I 'm at if you 're curious . Jen ? Oh , yeah . Good to go . Get me out ! Somebody , get me out ! I want out ! Let me out ! Easy , easy , easy ! Easy . Easy . - Thank you . - For the record , I didn 't last five minutes my first time . But it is a requirement . You have to pass . Well , then I guess I 'm out . Jen , I promise you , if this is the reason why you burn out of the program ... you will never forgive yourself . You know what to expect now . You can push yourself through it . You don 't know - You don 't understand . Look . I will get you into a later group . You can at least try it again . Yeah . Sure , whatever . It 's exactly what we need . As soon as you get it , let me know . Hey . All right ? Thanks . They didn 't keep you in there very long . What happened ? Your place ... right now . Will you marry me ? Uh-huh . Thirty meters . Twenty meters . Ten meters . Stand by . Touchdown . Landing secured ... even with the musical accompaniment . Hey . Sure you didn 't need any help ? - You 're supposed to be resting . - Oh . Well , you know , talking to you isn 't exactly taxing . You 're supposed to be completely off your feet , okay ? It 's a caloric burn thing . It 's like prepping for a marathon . - Why don 't you go watch a movie ? - There 's nothing on . - Well , read a book . - I 've read them all . - Practice your first line . - What ? Your line . You know , what you 're gonna say . You 're the first woman on Venus . I hope you have a line . Right ? - Yeah . - I hope it 's better than Walker 's ... " Red planet conquered . The warrior brought to his knees . " - Yeah . Of course it is . - Okay . - How 's he doing ? - Perfectly . We 've run three different simulations three times each . He 's nailed it every time . Can we wrap this up , Donner ? Let 's have one more time through . I want 549-B . It 's the last one , I promise . 549-B . - Wind gusting at 50 kilometers per hour . - Okay . Storm system moving in from the east . And ... I 'm in . - Watch your pitch . - I got side winds coming in . Hang on . I 'm gonna power through this . Thirty meters . Twenty meters . Ten . Simulation failed . All right . Going again . - I have nothing to say . - I find that hard to believe . No . I 'm going down to Venus tomorrow , and they 're gonna record ... whatever I say when I get there in the annals of history forever ... and , uh , I 've got nothing . I 'm sure you 'll think of something . - " Through difficulties to the stars . " - Venus is a planet . - It 's Seneca . It 's a famous Latin quote . - Oh . See , I took Mandarin . You know , one of the useful languages . And , by the way , aren 't you supposed to be resting ? - Okay . I am going to Venus tomorrow . - I know . We know . The whole world knows . - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . - I 'm sorry about before . - Ah . Are you still fighting with Rollie ? How did you get I 'm fighting with Rollie from " I 'm fine " ? Well , just ' cause you say you 're fine doesn 't make it true . It 's okay to reach out and ask for help sometimes , Jen . Zoe , I 'm fine . Call Rollie . I 'm leaving . I 'm gonna go . I know I messed up yesterday . I get it . It 's just - I don 't know what to think about Beta . At first , I thought it was God showing me my miracle . But then it kept me from passing my landing test . - Why would it do that ? - I don 't know . You said that you think it shows us things that we feel guilty about . - It 's just a theory . - Based on what ? Back in the war , there was a girl trapped inside a building . I tried to save her , and didn 't . - The scar on your back . - Yeah . And that 's what you were hallucinating about ? Like I said , it 's just a theory . But I don 't feel guilty about Hector . Hector was my miracle . - Your miracle ? - Yes . Beta shows me my miracle . Hector 's why I believe . He 's alive ! It 's a miracle ! Noise to keep us from napping - Whatever . I could sleep through World War IV . - How was your stint in solitary ? - Easy . I saw my miracle , and I knew I wasn 't alone . Hey , uh , y-you wanna be my miracle , baby ? You 're disgusting , Steven . What about you , blondie ? You wanna be my miracle ? I 'm gonna suggest that you never say that to anybody ever again . It is both creepy and gross . Yeah , well , that 's what I was going for . Yeah . Forty-two seconds . I think that must be a new world record for worst performance ever by an ASCAN . No , no . But you do know it is a requirement ... and ... you can get cut . - So I 've heard . - Seriously . You know what you need ? You need ... mind over matter . - What in the hell are you talking about ? - You don 't mind , it don 't matter . Oh , gosh . You are such a cheese ball . It 'll start ... a little quiet . It 's not so bad , right ? No . - It 's not so bad under here with you . - Mmm . - My proposal is this . An evening of dangerous games ... followed by - Hey . Hello . Again , creepy and gross . - Come on ! - I 'm sorry . - Yeah . - How 'd it go today ? - Fine . - Wow . You sound like an astronaut . You got the one-word answer , the flat delivery . You just gotta work on that drink . Hanging out alone tonight ? No , I 'm not alone . We 're here ... together . - Really ? - Hanging out , yep . Yeah . Yeah , we 're just hanging out , man . You guys are hanging out ? Doing what ? We 're playing darts , having some bevies . - You don 't play darts . - I love darts . - She 's really , really good . - Well , let 's go . - No . Now ? - Yeah , you love darts . - Come on , honey . He can join us . - Thanks . That 's me . It 's me . I gotta . I gotta . Hey . Oh . Okay . Okay . It was Rollie . He got me back in . Uh , bueno . Would you , um - Will you come with me ? I mean , it might not be so bad if I know you 're out there . Okay . I 'll try . - But just let me take a shower first . - Sure . - You okay ? - Yeah . I go in in half an hour . Schilling . - How was it ? - Like taking a nice , warm bath . So what is the miracle that Beta shows you ? Hector used to wait for me by the window to come home from school . That day , I saw Hector by the window like always . I walked in . Somehow , Hector got out . Hector ! He was dead . I begged God to give him back to me . And he did . God answered my prayers . God sent Hector back to me ... as a reward for my faith . I don 't care what it costs to bury this . Just make it happen . I 've been looking for you all morning . Their genomes have held steady since that first mutation . But in the last week , they 've mutated again . We 've been over this , Doctor . We could be looking at serious medical problems down the line . What 's gonna happen when they pick up Gamma ? - We hope for the best . - We have to tell them . I need you to go back out there to your station and do your job . I 'm trying to do my job , but you seem hell-bent on making that impossible . Sir . Claire , we have just regained a modicum of equilibrium up there . If I tell the crew that their genes might be changing , what does that gain me ? So , how was it for you ? I thought it was kind of relaxing , once you got past the weird sensation ... of not knowing where your body ends and the water begins . - Kind of like having a few drinks . - Yeah . So , I 've already had two glasses of wine . And if I don 't get some food ... I 'm liable to get to that place where I make bad choices . Like " dancing on the bar " bad choices ? It 's really not pretty . So I was wondering if you 'd like to , um ... save me from myself by getting some food with me . - I know this Italian place - - Claire . I like you ... a lot . Which is why I 'm gonna say no . I 'm not the guy you wanna get involved with . Well , why don 't I be the judge of that ? Trust me . - Hey . - Hey . - You ready ? - Nope . That 's the spirit . Have you , um - Have you seen Ted ? No . No , I haven 't . You okay ? Jen , look . You are putting way too much on this . You know , between you and me , it 's kind of a stupid exercise . I.S.O. And the space program have built-in redundancy . I mean , there are nine ways to solve every problem . You 're never alone . Somebody 's always got your back . Look . Try this . " Six sick slick slim sycamore saplings . " I 'm sorry . I don 't even know what to say to that . It 's a tongue twister , and it 's harder than you think . Trust me . You focus on getting that right ... and you won 't think about this . - And I 'm gonna be here the whole time , okay ? - Okay . Six sick slick slim sycamore saplings . Six sick slim - Six - Come on . Six sick - sick-sick - sycamore saplings . Six - ... sick slick slim sycamore saplings . Six sick slick slim - ... sycamore saplings . Six sick slim slick sycamore saplings . I am talking to a bunny . Good work . Okay . - Hey , Jen . - Kim ? L - I 'm sorry . Isn 't Rollie there ? He should be on shift by now . Yeah , he had to go to Bertran headquarters . Last-minute all-day meetings , mission status updates . Do you want me to leave him a message ? Why don 't I just call him ? What , he 's not reachable ? Communication lockdown until he leaves Bertran headquarters . Their rules , not ours . Okay . All right . Uh , thanks . Damn ! Well , that did it . You are officially the worst darts player in the world . - You want some tips ? - No . Oh ! Bathroom , right now . I don 't even want to wait to get you home . Oh , my God . It 's even better from this angle . - Is everything okay ? - Everything 's fine . Why wouldn 't it be ? I don 't know . Just checking . Okay . The only thing is , I 'm sort of in the middle of a game here . How about you let me finish ? Then I 'll buy you a drink . What do we need to win ? Double 20 . Mm-hmm . Mmm . I love darts . Thought you got the golden ticket to do nothing all day . - Looks like you 're working . - I have nothing to say . - Then say nothing at all . - Oh . Yeah , I hadn 't thought of that . I don 't know . Uh - Doesn 't have much of a ring to it . - What are we talking about , exactly ? - Venus . I need an opening line . - You should totally be , like - - That isn 't dirty . - I would - - Or juvenile . We could all - Or incomprehensible to anyone without five years of postgrad math . - Yeah , I got nothing for you then . - Yeah . Why did Donner even say anything to me ? You know , I would 've been fine . I would 've just gone down there , and something would 've rolled off my tongue - Okay , take it up with him then . He 's still in the lander . Still ? Simulation failed . Damn it . Run it again . All right , brother . - Let 's take a break . - Yeah , I 'm not gonna get a break tomorrow ... so I don 't know why I 'd take one today . Donner , this is an insanely hard simulation , okay ? You know the only reason it exists ... is to prove to dumb jock pilots that they can 't land in every condition . This is designed to be impossible . It 's not impossible . I 've done it before . Let 's go ! We would never launch in these conditions , okay ? It would never happen . Come on . Take a break . - Let 's go . - Tomorrow , I 'm gonna be down there with Zoe ... and you 're gonna be safe and sound up here like Goss was . I 'm not Goss , and this is not Mars . Nadia , let 's run it again . So Hector came back to life because of your prayer . Yes . Okay . How did he get out ? Did you leave the door open when you came in ? No . I walked in , I closed the door , and I locked it like always . Well , how did it get open ? Someone else leave the door open ? God needed for Hector to be on that street ... so that I can witness that miracle . He makes all things possible . So Hector goes from ... lying in the road dead ... to the sidewalk and breathing in your arms ? - Yes . - And how does he get from the street to the sidewalk ? It 's part of the miracle . - Are we done ? - Tell me again about that door . Are you doing okay , Claire ? I 'm fine . If you need to talk to someone - I don 't need to talk to someone , Eve . Do you realize what we 're doing here ? This is a 10 trillion dollar experiment without a control . - I know . - What kind of science is that ? So much good could 've been done with that money here on Earth . And instead , we send eight people hurtling across the galaxy ... - with a rock that we have no idea - - It 's about faith , Claire . And you know I 'm not talking about the religious kind . Now , I don 't know where I come down on God ... but I have faith in those eight astronauts , and I have faith in Beta . Yes , well , I 'm a scientist and a doctor ... and my only concern is the well-being of that crew . I can 't just take things on faith ... and neither should you . I walked in , and then Hector got out . How many times do I have to tell you this ? - So you didn 't forget to close the door ? - No ! Do you remember who else was home ? I can tell you who wasn 't home . My mother . Okay . Tell me about that . I don 't wanna talk about this anymore . You 're just questioning my faith ... because you have none of your own . Paula . Paula , we 're not finished here . Yes , we are . You know , you strike me as more of a usually Cabernet ... - never Chardonnay type of drinker . - What ? You just don 't seem like the type for whiskey shots . Are you secretly judging me ? - No , no , no . - It sounded like judgment . No . I 'm just being - just being observant . Did sense dep training get to you or something ? Sure . Let 's go with that . You know , I read somewhere that the best crew ... to send up into space ... would be a group of Buddhist monks . Think about it . They shut off all desire . And they meditate all the time and focus on their religion . Maybe I should try that . But it does sound really bloody boring , doesn 't it ? Oh ! - Okay . Come here . - Uh - - Come here . I 'm gonna help you . - No . I don 't need your help . No-You do , if only for the safety ofTommy 's patrons , okay ? - That guy was not hurt . - Come here . Ah . All right . Yaw left . Put your arm out . Now , it 's all about touch . You wanna be solid , but relaxed . All right ? Just let the dart fly itself . Solid , but relaxed . Take your time . That 's it . Beautiful . - Doesn 't get any better than that , right ? - Yeah . - That 's perfect . - Thank you . How about you buy me one more drink , and then take me home ? Okay , yeah , yeah . That sounds like - sounds like a plan . - Uh , I guess - Have a good night . - Yeah , you too . Ciao . Solid , but relaxed . Thanks . So , uh , I guess Ted never showed , huh ? Well , there was a meeting . He probably got pulled into it . - Right . - Hey , come on . You did it . Yea ! Look , why don 't you let me take you out for a drink to celebrate . Oh . I think I 've been more than enough trouble for one day , Rollie . I should just cut my losses and , um , head home . Thanks . Jen , you are never any trouble . I couldn 't have made it through this without you , Rollie . - Thank you . - Anytime . So this is how this is gonna work . - You 're back on the floor starting tomorrow . - What ? And this cost I.S.O. A small fortune , so we would really appreciate it ... if you could just keep this to yourself . As far as you 're concerned , as far as I 'm concerned , this never happened . What about the girl ? Did you hear me ? It never happened . This is completely messed up . Is that what you plan to tell her family , Mike ? You gonna tell her that nothing ever happened ? Is that what you 're gonna tell her if she ever wakes up ? Nothing ever happened ? I may not have killed her , but she 'll probably never walk again . But nothing ever happened , did it , Mike ? Now I 'm supposed tojust walk the hell out ofhere , hmm ? 'Cause nothing ever happened . Go home and call your wife . She 's been looking for you . Can I help you ? Whoa , whoa ! Hey , those are vintage ! Hey , hey . Shh . It 's okay . Please . Just hold me . - So how 's Paula ? - She 's okay on the surface . But there 's something underneath it all . You know , something she 's hiding . We 're pressing . I think I can help her once I figure it out . You okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . It 's just one of those days . Je t 'aime . I love you too . Bye . Thirty meters . - Simulation failed . - All right , going again . - End simulation . - What are you-You can 't be in here . - Okay ? You 're throwing me off my game . - You 're holding on too tight . What ? It 's all about touch . Solid , but relaxed . - All right , get out of here . - I 'm not going anywhere . Twenty meters . Ten meters . Touchdown . All right , Nadia . Let 's call it . - I think I 'm good . - All good . Isolation is a fact oflife in space . I don 't know if there 's any real training for it . There certainly isn 't a cure . Most of the time , isolation 's self-imposed . Sorry . I got called into a meeting at Mission Control . - Jen ? Jen , don 't . - Sometimes by shutting people out . Please don 't-Jen , don 't-Jen - Sometimes by inviting people in . And sometimes , by hiding alone in the Sutters 'oak barrel . Sometimes , it 's by losing faith in the very things that keep us going . # Dream chasing ' # # You followed the sun across mountains and oceans # # And cities # # And small town # # Stopped in someplace # # So they 're glad they met you Their hearts are now with you # # In joy # # And pain # # Young and plain # - # Young and plain # - What are you doing here ? You were there for me before I left for Antares ... so ... I 'm here for you tonight . Uh , I think - I think I 'm okay . Well ... I 'm not . I 'm terrified . We lean on each other ... and seek solace where we think we 'll find it . But sometimes , it 's just unavoidable . There 's nothing to do but embrace the isolation ... and walk out into the void alone . # Now , I 'm on my own # # Again # # Mmm . Ahh . English - US - SDH

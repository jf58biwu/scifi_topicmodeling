 PHIL : God , it 's cold . - I 'm getting too damn old for this . - Make sure that blast cap 's on tight . It 's not the cap I 'm worried about , it 's my damn fingers . Stop complaining . We fall behind , we violate our permit . Just a minute , almost there . MAN 1 ( OVER RADIO ) : Zone 1 , clear . MAN 2 : Zone 2 is clear . MAN 3 : Zone 3 , clear . MAN 4 : Zone 4 , clear . MAN 5 : Got a squatter in Zone 5 . Getting him out . After that , we 're clear here too . MAN 6 : Zone 6 , clear . MIKE : Okay , people . Building 's clean . Wrap it up and get out . Go for demolition in three minutes . D-minus-three minutes . PHIL : So , what 's up , man ? Stateside Diner ? Meatloaf sandwich ? DENNIS : Thinking steak and eggs at Cora 's . Or we could always head up Route 9 to Parkview . - Sure . - What ? " What ? " The waitress , the brunette . What 's her name ? Marcy ? No , I wasn 't even ... I was thinking about the lean corned beef . Yeah , right . The lean corned beef named Marcy . ( PHIL LAUGHS ) DENNIS : Hold up . What 's the matter ? You okay ? Dennis ? - What 's the problem ? - Nothing . - I don 't know . - You swept it , right ? Sure . I just ... I don 't know . All of a sudden , I got a weird feeling . Yeah ? Me too . Mine 's called , " I don 't wanna die looking at Dennis . " Come on , man . Hey , radio Mike , will you ? Tell him I wanna do another sweep . PHIL : Come on , man . Where you going ? Dennis , they 're holding the countdown for us . DENNIS : Damn it . Over here , let 's go . PHIL : Where are we going ? DENNIS : I think we missed something . Plans show another room over here . God , this doesn 't make sense . MIKE : Phil , you got Dennis ? What 's going on ? - We don 't have a lot of time . - Two more minutes . We 'll be right up . ( FOOTSTEPS ECHOING ) - You hear that ? - What ? ( STOMPS ) - Sounds hollow . - This place has been completely prepped . There 's nothing underneath there . It 's a solid foundation . - That sound solid to you ? - It 's probably frost damage . The concrete 's cracked . Man ... ( DENNIS GRUNTS ) ( BOTH PANTING ) Mike , I think you should come down here . DENNIS : This was definitely not in the blueprints . PHIL : God , what 's that smell ? MIKE : What do you think this was ? PHIL : I don 't know , but it 's old . MIKE : Oh , good , that narrows it down . ( RATS SQUEAKING ) PHIL : What the hell ? My God . Ella ? Mommy gets grumpy if I wake her too early . She always did . Come here . ( OLIVIA GRUNTS ) Do you want some pancakes ? Yes . - Yeah ? - Mm-hm . ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) CHARLIE : Francis . Hey , Jim . How are you , buddy ? I saw that your mayor got himself in a little bit of trouble . That couldn 't have been fun for you guys . When ? Has anyone taken anything from that fax in the last five minutes ? MAN 1 : No , sir . MAN 2 : Didn 't see it . I 'll call you back . Ugh . Liv , I 'm sorry . I told her to let you sleep late . - Oh , she did . Until 6 : 17 . - Yup , that sounds late for her . ELLA : Which one ? RACHEL : Uh , the yellow one . - Aunt Liv ? - Definitely the yellow . Did you tell her ? - Go get dressed . ELLA : Okay . OLIVIA : What ? We went apartment hunting yesterday . Really ? You 're thinking of moving to Boston ? Yeah , well , Ella loves it here and so do I , so ... - You can stay here as long as you want . - I know . But you don 't need a little creature waking you up at 6 : 17 every morning . ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) If that little creature is Ella , I am fine with it . - Hello . - It 's me . The Artist is back . How do you know ? Did we receive another fax ? - Yeah . Hartford office got one too . - Well , did we get a trace ? Sent from a copy store in Allston . I 've got Mason and Lewis headed over to question the employees . See if someone can give a description of whoever sent it . Okay , I 'm gonna be there in 15 minutes . Some horrifying event you 're not allowed to tell me about ? ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) Yeah . - Okay , now it 's gonna be 14 . BROYLES : Excuse me ? Agent Dunham ? - Oh , hey . - Get the Bishops . I need you to meet me at Children 's Hospital . - I just had an old case reopen and I ... - It can wait . BROYLES : After the boy was found , crews performed a search of the tunnels . It was determined they 'd been sealed shut for at least 70 years . The place was a sarcophagus . The only living things down there were rats , insects and him . And we have no idea how he got down there ? He 's so pale . BROYLES : He seems to be developing some sort of pigmentation . WALTER : Well , he probably hasn 't seen sunlight in years . Does he have a name ? BROYLES : He hasn 't spoken a word since he was found . Dr. Bishop , any thoughts ? Perhaps . First , I need a piece of special equipment . - My turntable . - Is that some kind of lab equipment ? No , no , no . A turntable . Record player . You enjoy music , don 't you , Mr. Broyles ? Well , imagine the agony of having an extensive record collection and having no means to play it . The agony . I 'll have someone get right on that . ( KNOCKS ON DOOR ) This is Dr. Winick , chief of Pediatrics . Look , I understand your agency 's taken an interest in this child ... - ... but he 's been through quite a trauma . - Is he sick ? Not as far as we can tell , but he 's having difficulty breathing . - We need to administer oxygen . - No , don 't . No . I wouldn 't do that . You said the tunnel was sealed . Is that correct ? It 's obvious that the child was trapped in a low-oxygen environment for so long his body adapted . That 's why he 's having trouble breathing . I don 't think so . Unless you have an IQ higher than mine I 'm not interested . Administering additional oxygen at this stage would simply cause his lungs to fill with fluid and drown him where he lies . ( PETER CLEARS THROAT ) We need to deprive him of oxygen . Get him a nasal cannula and a tank with low oxygen content . Perhaps 5 percent to start . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ) MAN : A griffin . - Excuse me ? Your tattoo . The body of a lion , the head of an eagle . That 's a griffin , right ? Just picked it out of the sample book . Thought it looked cool . Oh , well , a nice choice . Did it hurt much ? I always imagined getting a tattoo would hurt real bad . It 's a good pain . - I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to embarrass ... - You didn 't . Hey . Do you need a hand ? Thanks , I got it . Actually , you know , a little help would be great . - Cool motorcycle . What make ? - ' 67 Harley Shovelhead . She 's a beauty . Yeah , she is . ( SAWING ) ( BLOOD DRIPPING ) ( WHEEZING ) Any minute now . ( BREATHING EVENLY ) ( MONITOR BEEPS ) It worked . You 'll want to increase the oxygen flow 10 percent every hour till he acclimates . So you said that he hasn 't talked . How do we know he can hear ? He responds to sound . We examined his tympanic membrane , there 's no physical damage . In fact , considering how he was found , he seems fairly healthy . His heart sounds fine , his blood pressure 's strong . How do we think he survived down there ? What did he eat ? Rats , I 'd think . Moss , insects , high in protein . Tastier than you may think , especially millipedes . Although they all lack certain minerals which may account for his follicular dilemma . - His baldness . - Have you performed a urinalysis ? Haven 't been able to . We 've been feeding him intravenously . He hasn 't relieved himself since he arrived . I can 't say I blame him for not wanting to try this . Looks worse than the dreadful fill they served us in Claire 's . You were on staff at St. Claire 's Asylum ? No , no , no . I 'm not a medical doctor . I was a patient . ( PETER LAUGHS ) Got such a sense of humor , huh ? Walter , what do you say we keep those old St. Claire 's stories to ourself , yeah ? Hello . My name 's Olivia . What 's yours ? ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) ( OLIVIA CHUCKLES ) That 's my phone . It 's Charlie . Hi , I 'm still in the hospital . You won 't remember this , Peter , but you didn 't talk much either as a child . Could you get me the address ? Okay , tell him that I 'll be there as soon as I can . Charlie got a call from the local PD about the Artist . I 'm gonna go meet him now . What 's it say ? - Sam Gilmore . - He can write ? Is that your name ? I 'll see what we have on Sam Gilmores in Massachusetts . AGENT : The body was found just after 6 p.m. This part of the park 's empty this time of year . A couple of kids were using it as a shortcut when they found her . Definitely the work of the Artist . He clearly made alterations to the body postmortem . And put her here for the world to see . Here 's what we have so far . She 's a local girl . A process server from Weston . Next of kin is being notified by local agents as we speak . CHARLIE : Samantha Gilmore . Wait , did you say " Sam Gilmore " ? Yeah , Samantha Gilmore . You know her ? CHARLIE : Our perp 's name is the Artist . As some of you may recall , we had our first encounter with him three years ago . He killed four women in Lowell and Jamaica Plain over a period of two days . After the fourth murder , he stopped . WOMAN ( ON PHONE ) : Are you holding for Dr. Winick ? - Yes . - One moment , please . The killing bears all of the Artist 's trademarks . His MO is to kidnap , sedate and kill his victims . And then after he kills them , using surgical tools and chemicals he , in his mind , enhances their appearance . In this case , he bleached her skin , removed piercings and dyed her hair . - I 'll let Dr. Winick know you called . - Thanks . CHARLIE : It was preceded with a faxed invitation to view work to be displayed in public ... BROYLES : Anything yet ? - No . That was the hospital . They 're giving the boy an MRI . When he 's done , I 'm gonna go in and talk to him again . In the meantime , I 've sent his picture to Samantha Gilmore 's friends and family . But so far , no one recognizes him . You didn 't really expect that they would , did you ? No . So let me ask you the obvious , what 's the connection ? WALTER : Amala and Kamala , the wolf girls of India . And Marie-Angélique Memmie LeBlanc , the wild girl of Champagne . They 're all feral children who grew up completely isolated from human contact . Surviving , like our boy , for many years alone . I 'm guessing none of them could write upside down . You 're saying that the boy grew up down there ? Well , based on the blood work , yes . I 'm fairly certain . The lack of vitamin D , for one ... But also the complete absence of Lactobacillus ... Microorganisms that help us digest . They 're everywhere . WALTER : Precisely . If the boy had spent any time above the ground then he certainly would have absorbed those . But that still doesn 't explain how he got there . You said that , that place had been sealed off for decades . - The boy couldn 't be more than 10 ? - Well , he certainly looks that . You believe he might be older ? Well , given the environmental conditions , the lack of oxygen , light and their impact on his biological development he could be significantly older . But none of that explains how he knew Samantha Gilmore . No . That I can 't explain . But good news , Mr. Broyles I have located my turntable . So I don 't need you to purchase me one after all . It was under the sink in the john . So , obviously , I was sitting on the toilet ... - Walter . Think that 's enough information . AGENT : Agent Dunham . We just got another one . The Artist is going after another victim . Easy . Easy . - That 's a beautiful dog . - Thank you . - Is he friendly ? - Of course . - His name 's Mack . - Hey , Mack . Hey , Mackie . OLIVIA : Hey . They , uh ... They told me that you haven 't eaten anything solid yet . So I , uh ... I thought that you might like these more than the mystery meat . When I was a kid , I used to live on these . Except the yellow . Something about the color reminded me of medicine . You wanna try one ? That 's it . Good . Thank you . Yesterday you wrote down a name for me . Remember ? I thought today you could give me your name . MAN : You have a real way with him . Eliot Michaels , Department of Social Services . Olivia Dunham , FBI . Um , do you mind if I borrow Miss Dunham for a few minutes ? I promise I 'll bring her right back . I 'll be just outside . Dr. Winick brought me up to speed about your interest in the boy . Circumstances by which he was found attracted our interest . Mm-hm . It 's bizarre , huh ? ( SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) Have you been able to find out anything more about him ? You know , first name ? Where he 's from ? No . I 'm afraid , not yet . I just thought I 'd stop by and see him before I get the ball rolling . - How so ? - How so ? Well , physically it doesn 't seem as if there 's anything really wrong with him . So I 've arranged to have him moved . - Moved ? - To a facility that can provide ... - ... the treatment he needs . - When ? Tomorrow . You know , I hope . Assuming all the paperwork is in order . ( GASPING ) ( MONITOR BEEPING ) OLIVIA : What 's wrong ? - I 'm not sure . His BP and his heart rate are spiking . It 's okay , it 's okay . Hey , it 's okay . Shh . It 's gonna be okay . Aww . ( BREATHING EVENLY ) OLIVIA : Good . NURSE : Should I get the doctor ? - I think we 're okay . - All right . - You 're okay there ? - Maybe if you just gave us a moment . - Of course . Take your time . - Thank you . ( DIALING CELL PHONE ) I 'm at the hospital . I think we may have found another one . I should let you get some rest . - Anything so far ? - I just got here five seconds ago . So , what 's the plan ? - Start knocking on doors ? - Unless you can think of a better idea . - All right . You go east , I take west . - Okay . ARTIST : Shh . ( WOMAN WHIMPERING ) ARTIST : Shh , shh , shh . ( ARTIST SHUSHING ) ( WOMAN SOBBING ) Good . You 're very good . RACHEL : Mind some company ? Of course not . Did I miss you last night , or did you not even come home ? Uh , no , you didn 't miss me . Have you eaten anything ? MM 's . Liv ... Do you like it ? Your job ? Yeah , most days . Today , not so much . I followed a lead that didn 't pan out . What about you ? Why are you up ? Um ... ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) I 'm sorry . - Hello ? - We found our second victim . It 's Kate Harper . - Where ? - Right outside St. Catherine 's . Surrounded by candles . Good news is , we might have finally caught a break . ERT said they found some blood underneath her nails . They 're running it . - Okay . I 'll be right in . - There 's one more thing , Liv . The address the boy gave us ... A little while after we left , a neighbor found a dog tied to a fence . It was whimpering . - It was the victim 's dog . - We were there . There 's no way we could have known , Liv . But he was trying to tell us , and he was right , and we were there ? Walter , Olivia 's here . She needs to talk to you . ( WATER RUNNING ) - Walter . WALTER : Could you come back later ? I 'm about to step in the bath . No , she can 't come back . It 's the middle of the night . She needs to talk to you right now . ( WATER STOPS ) Honestly , Peter , can 't a man get a ... ? Agent Dunham . Why didn 't you tell me Agent Dunham was here ? - I 'm pretty sure I did . - Well , what can I do for you ? OLIVIA : Walter , it turns out that the boy was right . He gave me a clue , but I didn 't know what I was looking for . Do you have any thoughts at all ? Any idea how I can reach him ... - ... or how he 's doing any of this ? - I believe I know how he 's doing it . Since he 's been living underground for so long his hypersensitivity to light and sound ... It 's just possible he may also be sensitive to peoples ' emotions . A raw nerve able to intuit the feelings and intentions of others . - Your killer , for one . - So are you saying that he 's psychic ? - No , no . More a shark . - A shark ? Specifically , their electromagnetic field which allows them to detect their prey 's bioelectric field from a distance of many miles . We humans have it too , of course . Pheromones . Undetectable chemicals that nonetheless affect our behavior ... - ... our sex drive , our fear ... - Hey , speaking of sex drive ... Oh , Peter , don 't be such a prude . I 'm sure Agent Dunham knows what a penis looks like . - Don 't you , Agent Dunham ? - My father , ladies and gentlemen . But how would he know things that I don 't ? Know about the killer or the victims that he 's never even met ? My dear , there is much that is unexplained until it is . In short , he has no idea . But even if you 're right and he can sense the killer he can 't tell me that . Not in a way that I could do anything about it . Well , if that 's the problem , then there 's no problem . What does that mean ? Well , the boy is obviously thinking , yes ? Having thoughts . We just haven 't been able to hear them . And I 'm sure you can do that , can 't you ? Hear his thoughts ? Perhaps I can . OLIVIA : Did you make that ? Hey . Listen , I wanna take you away from here for a while . Is that okay ? WILE E. COYOTE ( ON TV ) : Wile E. Coyote , super genius ... - Vintage Bugs Bunny . BUGS BUNNY : Eh , what 's up , doc ? Didn 't get any better than this , right ? WILE E. COYOTE : Being a genius has its advantages . Aha ! I found it . Neural stimulator . Is there anything it can 't do ? Is that what you 're gonna use to read his thoughts ? Not to read them , my dear . To listen to them . - I wish you would 've told us . - Why ? You could 've saved us the hassle . You 're not putting that on that poor kid . The last time you used that thing , you drilled it into the guy 's head . If you think he 'll find it disagreeable , I suppose it could be modified . Really ? Didn 't think to mention that to the last guy ? It shouldn 't be too much trouble . I mean , we merely need to intercept the responses from the speech centers of the brain which can be achieved by placing electrodes in the halo ring . After that , it 's simply a matter of synthesizing the impulses . Think of it as creating artificial vocal cords . Simple . Like making an omelet . Actually , son , a good omelet is far more complex . We 'll have him talking in no time . Where 's the child that was in this room ? - He was discharged . - By whom ? Just remember that you don 't have to do anything that you don 't wanna do . If for a second you 're scared or you don 't like what 's happening you just squeeze my hand like that , okay ? Is he ready ? As ready as he 'll ever be , I guess . PETER : I 've seen that look before usually right before somebody throws up . WALTER : Agent Farnsworth , ready ? PETER : Walter , what are you doing ? - Watch and learn , son . ( AL GREEN 'S " LOVE AND HAPPINESS " PLAYING ON RECORD ) ( GROANS ) Ooh ! Whoo-hoo ! ( LAUGHING ) Works every time . - Nicely done , Walter . WALTER : Thank you . You can turn the music off now , Agent Farnsworth . ( MUSIC STOPS ) What 's wrong ? ( DOOR OPENS ) What 's going on in here ? Did you think you could steal a child out of protective custody and that no one would notice ? I didn 't steal him . The child 's assisting us in a criminal investigation . Assisting you how ? No offense , Mr. Michaels , but that 's classified information . The Department of Social Services doesn 't have clearance to know that . - What ? - Mr. Michaels isn 't Social Services . He 's with the CIA 's Directorate of Science and Technology . I 'd have told you earlier myself , but you don 't have clearance to know that . We were informed the DST would be taking full custody of the child . So they can what ? Study him ? ( SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) This child was , apparently , able to survive for years underground in an oxygen-deprived environment with no food or water . Surely , you could see how someone might wanna exploit that . So you wanna take him to protect him , is that it ? I don 't buy that for a second . - Dunham . MICHAELS : It 's all right . It doesn 't make any difference what you think . The boy 's coming with me . I 'm afraid this is above both of us . ( KNOCKS ON DOOR ) ASTRID : Agent Francis just called . He said we got another invitation from the Artist . ( SIGHS ) Mr. Michaels , suppose you gave us one day . A day ? BROYLES : He can help us catch a murderer and save a life . The boy will be under my protection . I 'll personally guarantee his safety . If I agree to this then you 'll turn the boy over to me without a fight . Do we have an agreement ? We do . My very educated mother just served us nine pies . No . That 's the planets of the solar system . Or at least , was . Wanna take a look at this ? His name is Roadblock . He 's not one of your top-tier GI Joes but he was the best we had . WALTER : Wait , wait . - Huh . It 's funny . I always remember the scar being on the other side . You want him ? Cannot build phallic puzzles in the lab . No . - What is he doing ? - Mnemonics . Like , a rhyme or phrase to help memory . Like , HOMES stands for the Great Lakes . That 's Huron ... I 'm familiar with it . Why is he doing it ? He is trying to remember which wires go into which connections on the machine . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Yeah , thanks , Charlie . I will . Keep me posted . - More bad news ? - We got the forensics report . We were hoping that the blood under the second victim 's fingernails ... - ... was a match for the killer . - But no ? Not unless Gene is the killer . It wasn 't human , it was bovine . - You said cow blood ? - Yeah , and some plastic polymers . How would someone get cow 's blood on their fingers in Boston ? OLIVIA : Astrid , could you contact the Bureau of Animal Health ? Start pulling livestock licenses around Boston . Petting farms , research facilities , anything . - Yeah , got you . - She 's a bad mama jama . Ha . Alpha , beta , theta and gamma . She 's a bad mama jama . Signal , amplification , bifurcation , modulation , juxtaposition . You hanging in there , kiddo ? WALTER : ... translating motor-linguistic impulses into language ! - Yeah , me too . - Peter , get me the red wires . - Peter ? - Here 's a thought . Couple years ago , I was working as a floor sweeper at a meat-packing plant . - Sounds awesome . - You have no idea . My point is , we had these big rolls of industrial-grade plastic to wrap their meat in before we would send them to the grocery stores . - Cow 's blood and plastic . - Yeah . Okay . I believe we 're ready . - Peter . - Yeah . ( BUZZING ) Yes . Listen to that . Listen to what ? That 's just random noise . No , that 's just the computer calibrating the signal-to-noise ratio . Adjust the attenuator setting to 70 decibels . ( BLEEPING AND CRACKLING ) ( VOICE BABBLING ) That sounds a little more like a voice . Yes . And now the sound-pressure level . Dial the audio meter to 1500 hertz . - Go slower . - If you wanna do this yourself , feel free . There . ( VOICE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) Astrid , quickly . Get me a tape recorder . ( SHIVERING ) Turn the machine off right now . Turn it off . He 's freezing . Help me get this off him . Hey , Astrid , can you grab us a blanket ? Free in the front . Here . - We 're gonna get you warmed up . - Doesn 't make any sense . If anything , brain activity should generate heat . OLIVIA : We 're trying to track down a suspect in a murder investigation . What , you mean the guy in the news who killed those girls ? We 're not sure . Maybe . But any past or present employees that stick out to you ? Like , antisocial behavior or a history of violent incidences here at work ? No . They 're good men . Hard workers . Well , I 'm gonna need a copy of your employee records . - Okay . - And a sample of your shipping plastic . Plastic ? Why ? It could be an element in our investigation . - Will that be a problem ? - No , but ... Mr. Wu ? A man came in here yesterday and I sold him some plastic . ( CHATTERING ) Allow me . Oh , thank you . Your mother raised you well . OLIVIA : Hey , Peter , it 's me . I 'm just leaving . So how 's the boy ? Has Walter made any progress ? PETER : Hard to say . We heard something but I don 't know if it was the kid trying to talk . I don 't want you to get upset about this , because he is fine but something kind of weird did happen . - Weird how ? - He started shivering all of a sudden . Like the temperature dropped . It didn 't . - Is he sick ? - No , he seems fine . We got him wrapped up in a blanket . He 's doing okay . You find anything ? Yeah . Looks like the Artist bought some plastic from a slaughterhouse . I got a sketch , all thanks to you . - Hey , guys , we got good news . - What 's that ? The plastic did come from a meat-packing plant . Olivia got a sketch . What about you ? Gonna go back to the FBI ? - Ask her if it was refrigerated . - Hold on a second . Ask her if the plant was refrigerated . It 's a meat-packing plant . Let 's go out on a limb and say that it 's refrigerated . What does that matter ? Because that explains everything . ASTRID : Walter , you 're not making any sense . WALTER : Of course I am . The boy , our strange little friend , is an empath . PETER : He senses other people 's emotions . You already said that . WALTER : Did I ? OLIVIA : Go on , Walter . What are you saying ? That he 's capable of making connections . Emotional connections . To a construction worker who found him , the killer , but most importantly he 's emotionally bonded to you , Agent Dunham . That 's why he 's telling you about the crimes . Because he knows that the information is important to you . He 's trying to help you . Are you trying to help me ? That man who 's been hurting people is going to hurt someone else unless I stop him . Do you know who he is ? Can you tell me anything about him ? Maybe he doesn 't know . Or he can 't control the ability all the time . Perhaps a small electric shock to kick-start things . No . It 's something different . It 's like he 's mad at me . - Because he doesn 't wanna leave . - What ? You told Michaels that once the boy helped you stop the Artist you 'd turn him over to him . He heard you . Or more accurately , felt you . I 'm sorry . I 've been so caught up in what I needed that I forgot how strange this must seem to you . And I know how scared you must be , but I need your help again . I can 't even stop them from taking you even though I wish I could . And if you really can feel what I 'm thinking you know how much I mean that . Thank you . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) OLIVIA : Nice car , sir . Where you headed ? - Home . I was out to dinner . CHARLIE : Open the trunk , please . It 's clear . Okay , thank you . Sorry for the inconvenience . What 's going on , officer ? What are you doing in the neighborhood ? I ... Just coming home from work . Haven 't had anything to drink . Look , do you mind if I ask what you 're looking for ? I 'm sorry . We 're not allowed to say . Sir , we need to check the back of your vehicle . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( CAR HORN HONKS ) OLIVIA : Charlie , check the back of the van . Liv , it 's him . We found a victim . She 's alive . - You all right ? - Yeah . Oh , God . This is Francis . We need EMS at the cemetery behind the 1600 block of York . ( PHONE RINGS ) - Broyles . OLIVIA : It 's Olivia . I need you to help me with something . Here . And then we just do the blood work , okay ? Okay . - Excuse me , Dr. Winick ? - Yes . I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment . Sure . Hi . Hi . I think you 'll find he 's doing much better . Hi . Oh , thank you . You remember Dr. Winick . She 's gonna take you now , but not to a facility . She 's going to take you to a home with a very nice family that are gonna take care of you and keep you safe . We should go now . Ah ... Bye . MICHAELS : What do you mean , he 's gone ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Michaels . - Gone where ? - That 's what we can 't figure out . He disappeared from right under the noses of a protective detail . - How 's that possible ? He 's just a kid . - Yes . A kid who , as you said , lived his entire life underground which still begs the question how he got there in the first place . I 'm beginning to suspect there 's a lot about him we don 't understand and apparently , we never will . ELLA : No , I didn 't ! I didn 't say it ! RACHEL : Yes , you did . - Hi , Liv . OLIVIA : Yeah . Mommy is so bad at Simon Says . She won 't even do what I say . RACHEL : Four years old , and she 's drunk with power . I have created a monster ! - Do you wanna play with us ? - Oh , don 't do that . Let Aunt Liv rest . Sure . - I 'm Simon . - Okay . - Simon says , " Put your hands in the air . " - Okay . Touch your nose . ( ELLA LAUGHS ) You lost . RACHEL : Okay . Again , again . ELLA : Simon says , " Touch your nose . " You lose again !

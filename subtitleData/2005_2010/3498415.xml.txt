 OENOMAUS : No one even knows where he came from . Some say he was from Thrace in Greece . But he never said . All I know for sure is he had once been in the army . And then he and his wife were seized and taken to the slave market in Rome . And that 's where the story of Spartacus really began . SLAVE TRADER : A woman and a child . We 'll start at 3,000 sesterces . What am I bid ? 3,000 sesterces . BIDDER : Four ! SLAVE TRADER : Four . 4,000 sesterces . Yes , come on . For the family . Good workers . Good breeders . Who will give me 5,000 sesterces ? You 've a good eye , Batiatus . He 's special , this one . Where did you serve ? Not a soldier . So you 're not a soldier ? - I 'll take him . 2,000 sesterces . - 3,000 . With the female . BATIATUS : What do I want with a woman ? This one I 'll make a gladiator . Two . Two and a half . Hold on . All right , all right . Two . Get him . No , no ! WOMAN : No ! WOMAN : No ! No ! No . No ! No , Spartacus ! No ! OENOMAUS : Spartacus would become known as the man who fought back . He was a hero . No , Spartacus ! He was my friend . No ! But most of all , he was a slave who took on the might of Rome to be free . - Pleased to meet you . - Welcome to hell . Come on ! OENOMAUS : He didn 't look like much when I first saw him . We 'd been there for years , me and my mate Crixus , ever since they 'd snatched us in Gaul . One of the perks of being a veteran gladiator was beating up the new arrivals . And I fancied my chances with him . Huh ? You call this fighting , huh ? Good . Good . I 'll kill you ! You 'll be pissing blood for a week . Guards ! SPARTACUS : One , two , three ! Get them to the cells ! Come on ! Put your backs into it ! CRIXUS : No use . I said ... You should listen to him . You know how long he 's been here ? He 's crazy . Whoever she is , forget her . Best to forget everything in here . Believe me . - You 'll learn . - No , he won 't . You won 't forget your hate . OENOMAUS : A few months later , Spartacus had become one of us . We were ordered to fight in the arena in Capua . It was a routine job . A politician who wanted to suck up to the voters would put on a show . And we were the entertainment . So what have you got for me this afternoon ? A marvellous spectacle , I assure you , Senator . - Worth every penny . - Well , I should hope so . It cost me enough . OENOMAUS : Our paymaster that day was Marcus Licinius Crassus , a man with a fortune in slaves and property who was aiming for high office . - A good turnout , don 't you think ? - Mmm . A full house , sir . More people , more votes , Batiatus . What a pleasant surprise , Senator Lentulus . More than we deserved , I 'm sure . Or at least expected . The people appreciate seeing the future consul , I always think . Of course . We are deeply honoured . That 's very gracious of you , Marcus Crassus . What the hell is he doing here ? He 'd turn up at the opening of a shithouse if he thought there was a vote in it . OENOMAUS : When you went into the arena , you didn 't expect to die . The deal was simple . Fight hard , put on a good show , keep the crowd happy , and they 'd let you live . If you showed cowardice , then they 'd turn nasty . Fight me . I 'm trying to save your life . Fight me . MAN : Send him to the galleys ! MAN : Fight him ! Fight him ! How disappointing . And after all the trouble you went to . You promised me a spectacle . This is pathetic . I assure you , sir . It will not happen again . CROWD : Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Please . You 'll get used to it . OENOMAUS : But he never did get used to it . I wonder if it was then that he started thinking about escape . Roll . Tell everyone supper 's ready . We 're getting out of here . Not your lucky night . Spartacus ! Welcome to hell . High ground . Move ! OENOMAUS : And that was it . We were out . We had no plan . Just 70 of us on the run , hiding on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius , 20 miles from Capua . Do it . OENOMAUS : Escaped slaves were like vermin . We had to be hunted down . So they sent 4,000 men . They outnumbered us fifty to one . OENOMAUS : We 're trapped . No way out . SPARTACUS : There 's always a way out . Look at them . They 're not patrolling the perimeters , and the sentries are all facing this way . - That should tell you two things . - CRIXUS : What ? One , they don 't expect us to attack . - We 're gonna attack ? - You try and stop me . And two , they 're raw conscripts , amateurs . Now , look again . - What are they doing ? - Watching us . Exactly . - Just like the crowd in the arena . - So ? So the crowd in the arena doesn 't watch the exits , does it ? No one 's watching the rear . How thick are those vines ? Evening , ladies . ALL : Spartacus ! Spartacus ! Spartacus ! Spartacus ! Spartacus ! Spartacus ! Spartacus ! Spartacus ! Spartacus ! Spartacus . Psst ! There 's something you need to see . Who are they ? They 're slaves , mostly . What do they want ? What do you think they want ? They wanna join you . OENOMAUS : Over the months , more and more of them came . Soon there were thousands . Not just men . Women and children . Suddenly , we weren 't just outlaws . We were a movement . That 's when the trouble started . Hundreds of them . Where are they all coming from ? They 're flocking to the mighty Spartacus . Look , this one 's brought his wife and his bloody mother . How old is he ? How old are you ? Not a fighting man among them . Useless . So what are you gonna do with all this lot , then ? I don 't know . Feed them . What do you think you 're doing ? What 's it look like ? You can 't spare that . There isn 't enough for the men . So what do we do ? Let them starve ? They 're no use to us . That 's your army , Spartacus . Feed it or someone else will . You want food ? Go find it , then . OENOMAUS : We weren 't the only ones who didn 't have enough food . We slaves had built the Roman Republic . Slaves worked the fields . We brought in the harvest . We built their buildings and we cleaned their streets . Without us , Rome would be brought to its knees . You see this ? It costs twice what it did last week . How am I supposed to feed my family ? Answer me that . I understand , I really do . It 's a disaster . What is Consul Lentulus doing about it ? - What are you doing about it ? - Leave it with me . What makes you think you can do better ? Because I 'm here and Lentulus isn 't . Because I 'm listening and Lentulus isn 't . Look , if you need money to tide you over , come and see me , do you understand ? I 'll do everything in my power to help . OENOMAUS : Meanwhile , Crixus took Spartacus at his word and went looking for food . Prepare to die , Roman slaves ! Empty the granaries ! Take the cattle , the sheep , anything ! Whatever you can find ! No ! No ! No , please ! Don 't ! Don 't ! Please stop ! No ! I should have killed you when I had the chance . You think you had a chance ? You gutless piece of shit . You 're no better than the Romans . I never said I was . Hey ! Hey ! Where are you taking him , Spartacus ? Where are you taking us ? Where are we going ? OENOMAUS : In his own brutal way , Crixus had put his finger on it . And Spartacus knew it . We couldn 't carry on living as a robber band , hidden in the hills . There were too many of us to hide . And too many of us couldn 't fight . We needed a plan . A plan that could look after thousands of men , women and children . Crixus has a point . OENOMAUS : Mmm ? We can 't run forever . Face it . We can 't run at all , not with this lot . - We can stand and fight . - And lose . No . We can 't beat the whole Roman army . We keep moving . Where ? Where are we going ? As far as we have to . - That 's it ? - Have you got a better idea ? It 's not much of a life . But it is life . We 'll go north , across the Alps . Tomorrow ! Tomorrow , we march north to Gaul and out of Roman territory . We 'll find ourselves a new home . Gaul ? Have you ever been to Gaul , Spartacus ? Have you seen the women ? No . I didn 't think so . You go to Gaul . I 'm gonna stay here and fight . I saw my family burn , Spartacus . I saw my children burn . I want revenge ! Who 's coming with me ? Who 's coming with me ? - Me ! - Me ! MAN : Me ! Oenomaus ? I 'm sorry , Crixus . Why ? Because I think you 're wrong about the women . OENOMAUS : Spartacus ' rebellion had become a political embarrassment . But for some , it was also an opportunity . My friends , my heart goes out to you . You decent , hard-working merchants are facing ruin . And what does Lentulus do ? Well , either he 's been sending incompetents to deal with the situation , or he 's allowed the army to grow so soft , it can 't defeat a bunch of slaves . He is weak . Weak . If you have a grievance , Marcus Crassus , air it in the Senate rather than the marketplace . With respect , Consul , it 's in the marketplace that the people are suffering , not the Senate . I know exactly what you 're up to . You don 't give a damn about the slave revolt or the people . This is about power . All I 'm doing is giving the people a voice . And it 's you who have the power , not me , remember ? - Even if you 're not prepared to use it . - How dare you ? As a matter of fact , I 've decided to take control of the situation myself . OENOMAUS : Lentulus mobilised a massive army . The first slaves they ran into were Crixus ' mob in the Garganus Mountains . We got there too late . - I 'm sorry , Oenomaus . - Don 't say another word . He was my friend . You know what ? Perhaps he was right . He 's dead . What , and this is living ? Looking after a bunch of women and children ? - At least he died like a man . - He died like a fool . We made a promise . Revenge , Spartacus . We lived for it . It was all we had . You want revenge , then live . They want you dead , so live and you win . There 's no other way . Come with me to Gaul . What kind of a victory is that ? It 's the only one we can get . OENOMAUS : So Spartacus led 40,000 of us north , slowly getting nearer and nearer to the Alps and our new home in Gaul . All the time , the Romans were closing in . They 're gaining on us all the time . We can 't move any faster . There is nothing for it . We 'll have to stand and fight . You said that we couldn 't do that , said that was suicide . Two miles north of here there 's a gorge . If we can lure them in there , their numbers will count against them . Packed together like rats in a trap . It 's our best chance . Now ! Go , go , go , go ! We did it . We bloody did it ! - We were lucky , that 's all . - No . No , that wasn 't luck . Huh ? With you leading us , we can beat them all . They want you to lead us against Rome , to victory ! - No , Oenomaus ... - Victory ! - Oenomaus , listen . Listen . Listen ! - Victory ! Victory ! Another three days ' march , maybe two , and we 're there . Gaul . - We 've done it , we 're out . - No . Escaping , you 'll just be an escaped slave . Huh ? You 'll still be a slave . Wherever you are . To be free , I mean really free , we have to kill our master . Now , Spartacus . Now for Rome . Huh ? Rome . Huh ? Rome ! ALL : Rome ! Rome ! Rome ! Rome ! Rome ! Consul Lentulus . I came as soon as I heard . What for , to gloat ? To offer my sincere commiserations . I 'd like to say it could 've happened to the best of us , but it didn 't . Oh , you 're enjoying this , aren 't you ? No , Lentulus , I 'm not enjoying this . Who could enjoy a disaster on this scale ? I did my duty . Your duty ? Thanks to you , a slave army is marching on Rome . It 's time someone strong was put in charge . Someone who gets the job done . CRASSUS : So , you 're the army that ran away from slaves . Soldiers ? You 're a laughing stock . No doubt you 're saying I 'm a businessman , not a soldier . What do I know about strategy and tactics ? Well , I do know about leadership . I know about discipline . I know about efficiency . Every 10th man to step forward . Decimate them . OENOMAUS : You had to hand it to Crassus . In just a few months , he changed that army . When we arrived on the hills outside Rome , that was only too clear . This is a mistake . We could 've been in Gaul by now . You think we can 't win ? You swore to lead us . What do you want me to say ? I want you to lead us . They believe in you ! I didn 't ask for this ! Go ! Go on , get out ! Go ! Go on ! You go with them . You still don 't understand , do you ? There 's nowhere left for them to go . You said you 'd lead us to a new home . You 've done that . You 're their home , Spartacus . We 're staying with you . Forget Rome . Just tell us what to do , we 'll do it . We can 't go north , we head south . OENOMAUS : So , once again , Spartacus led us off , with no real idea of where we were going . All the while , Crassus followed us , tracking our every move . They 're heading south . Good . Don 't let them turn or rest . Herd them like cattle . We 're gonna drive those bastards into the sea . OENOMAUS : And that 's just what he did . He pursued us all the way from Rome to Rhegium at the toe of Italy . - What do we do now ? - We grow wings . Gentlemen , we have them cornered . And now we 're going to build a wall , 35 miles across , stretching from coast to coast and bordered by trenches . No one gets in or out . I 'm sorry . What for ? Everything . No one said I had to follow you . Anyway , there 's always a way out . That wall , what does it look like to you ? 'Cause to me it looks defensive . OENOMAUS : So ? They 're scared of us . They don 't want to fight , not if they can help it . They 'll starve us out . That 'll take too long . We 're an embarrassment to them , remember ? They need a result and they need it fast . Perhaps they 'll listen . What do you mean , a deal ? What have we got to offer them ? SOLDIER : Sir . Over there , sir . Look , over there , sir . Well , I 'll be damned . So , you 're the mighty Spartacus . I 've come to offer you terms . You 've come to offer me terms ? Kill me . Spare my men . You really are stupid , aren 't you ? You 've no idea . Do you think the life of one slave means anything to me , or to Rome ? You will surrender to me , and I 'll decide who lives and dies . All those who fought against us , I will execute . The others will return to work . These are my terms . Then it 's over ? Yes , it 's over . - So , we fought for nothing , then ? - No , Oenomaus . We fought for everything . But I haven 't understood it until now . SPARTACUS : We have what we fought for . To be free means having the right to choose . Tomorrow , you can stand and fight with me , or you can accept Rome 's terms and take your chances . It 's up to you . I 'm not going to give you orders . This is your choice . Who 's with me ? Once we lived for our masters . Tomorrow , we die for ourselves . That is freedom . Go ! Go ! On my command , we charge the centre of the line . ROMAN COMMANDER : Company , halt ! Are you ready ? Attack ! Where 's the body of Spartacus ? I told you I wanted the body . I 'm sorry , sir , we can 't find it . Crucify them . Crucify them all . OENOMAUS : Six thousand of us were crucified as a warning to any slave who might dream of rising up against Rome . But the Romans never did find Spartacus ' body . I like to think he 's still out there . Of one thing I am sure , when the centuries pass , few will remember the name of Marcus Licinius Crassus , but Spartacus will live on forever , because he showed us something that we never knew before . That a slave didn 't have to just take it . He could be free .

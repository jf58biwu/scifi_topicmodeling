We also know that the only remaining piece of your alien All-Spark here on one of the most secure naval bases in the world . we have located the shard . And since no one there--there 's only one clear conclusion : You . The Autobots . They 're here to hunt you . What 's there to hunt for on Earth besides that ? The Fallen shall rise again " ? Sounds to me like something 's coming . So let me ask if we ultimately conclude that our national security is best served will you leave peacefully ?

What sort of hideous mosalleem is this ? show yourselves ! Or suffer my infinite wrath ! old spinal called based organisms . Bugger ! Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire ! Prepare for a systems ' override . this guy did not age well . He either heard it . Command these doors to open . Fire ! fire ! Bollocks . these worthless- - Wait a second . rust in my arse . the museum 's gonna be very angry . Very angry . We gotta catch that plane ! I 'm on a mission . wait . Hey ! What do you want ? we just want to talk ! I 'm on a mission ! I 'm a mercenary goon-bringer . What planet am I on ? Earth . might as well call it " dirt " . Planet dirt . is that robot civil war still going on ? Who 's winning ? The Decepticons . I changed sides to the Autobots . " changed sides " ? It 's a choice . It 's intensely personal decision . So much negativity . Who wants to live a life filled with hate ? Meaning you don 't have to work for those freaking Decepticons ? they destroy the whole Universe . Warrior Goddess ! Who 's your little Autobot ? Oh you cutes . Name 's Wheelie . say my name ! What are you allowing to happen to your foot just now ? Sam . and he 's nude and he 's perverted . Can you just- - Can you stop ? what are you doing ? I don 't wanna argue it . What were you saying ? I told you my name was Jetfire ! someone shit in the bed this morning ? Pretty stout with my mother . My ancestors have been here for centuries . one was a wheel ! The first wheel ! Do you know what he transformed into ? No . dignity and- - My boosters are fried . I thought we could help each other . You know things I don 't know . I know things you don 't know . I do . I don 't think he knows anything . I don 't know . they 're symbols but they are in my mind . all this is in my mind . And Megatron wants what 's in my mind . Him and someone called the Fallen . The Fallen ? I know him . He left me here to rust . The original Decepticon . chaos they were a part of my mission I remember now . Of a dagger 's tip and the key ! what are you talking about ? No time to explain . everybody ! that wasn 't so bad . I was overseeing the wrong planet . that frickin ' hurt ! my God ! God ! this will be a perfect moment . Except you landed on my testicles . Please get off ! My balls ! Sam ! Where are we ? Simmons ! Hey ! Yeah ! my God . What is this ? It 's Vegas ! You guys okay ? Yeah ! Hey ! I think we 're in Vegas ! really hurts . You 're just lucky that I didn 't get hurt . shut up ! I told you I was opening the space bridge . It 's the fastest way to travel to Egypt . What did you tell us ? You didn 't tell us anything ! You didn 't tell us anything . Why are we in Egypt ? fleshwing . You would do the informed . Can you just stop for a second ? Can you focus ? Can you tell us why we 're in Egypt so we can all have a little bit assemblance and peace of mind ? This planet was visited by our race once before by our earliest ancestors a millenium ago . the life blood of our race . let my wretched self . Do you have any idea what is like a slowly fall of parton die ? okay ? Old-timer . tell it . our ancestors built a great machine . It harvests Energon by destroying suns . Destroy suns ? You mean blow them up ? our original leaders . And they set out in the Universe seeking distant suns to harvest . The Primes set out with one rule : Never destroy a planet with life . Until one of them tried to defy this rule . was the Fallen . He despised the human race . And he wanted to kill you all by turning on that machine . The only way to activate it is with a legendary key called the Matrix of Leadership . A great battle took place over possession of the Matrix . but to steal and hide it from him . they gave their lives to seal the Matrix away in a tomb made of their very own bodies . A tomb we cannot find . that deadly machine remains . The Fallen knows where it is . your world will be no more . Okay so how do we stop it ? Only a Prime can defeat the Fallen . Optimus Prime ? So you met a Prime ? You must have met a great descendant . Is he alive ? Here ? On this planet ? He sacrificed himself to save me . So he 's dead . it 's impossible . No one else could stop the Fallen . So the same energy that 's going to be used to reactivate the machine Could that energy somehow be used to reactivate Optimus and bring him back to life ? like no other . So then how do you get us to the Matrix before the Decepticons get to me ? it 's your bloom . three kings will reveal the doorway . Find the doorway ! go ! That was my mission . It 's your mission now . Go before the Decepticons find me and find you . That was my CIA contact . Says Ancient Sumerian used to call the Gulf of Aqaba the Dagger 's Tip . That 's the dagger 's tip . It 's part of the Red Sea . Got it . It divides Egypt and Jordan like the tip of a blade . 29 and a half degrees north . 35 east . There it is . first thing we gotta do is get Optimus to Dagger 's Tip . How are you gonna get him halfway around the world ? We 're gonna make a call . We got the cops . guys ! you gotta get off this road and lay low . they 'll pick up . This is just called blending in like a ninja . How about I 'll lay my piss in your face ? They 're gone . Wait another time . How are you gonna make the call to Lennox ? they 're gonna tranquil in one base ? They 'll track you here in seconds . CIA is all over this place . You 're gonna call ? that 's--that 's a good idea . Alright ? I mean I just was My mind in other things . Like why don 't you get being chipped in prison . New Jersey This departure : 2100 hours . So we 're shipped in back to base . This is central at stake . phone call . you know ? One with the attitude break ? I need the truck . The truck . We got a possible resurrection going on over here .

We need to go . 34.88 east . Gulf of Aqaba . Egypt . Are you serious ? Sir . Even if we could figure out a way to get big man over there . How is this little kid 's supposed to bring him back to life ? I don 't know . But we gotta trust him . let 's go over it again . the three kings will reveal the doorway . That 's what he said . You know what that means ? what does it mean ? I have no idea . checkpoint . I don 't have my passport . Passport . Idiota ( Idiot ) ! They have cams at top . He 's the one that they want . chill .

Ladies first . you 're gonna be a gentleman . You 're really chivalrous . Why are you mad at me ? I 'm not I 'm not mad . 000 miles to keep you from getting killed . I know . Who else could be your girlfriend too ? Look at the things that go through with me . And now we 're underneath the moon and the stars and the three most beautiful pyramids on the planet and you still can 't even tell me that you love me . What ? Wait . Why do boys always change the subject ? The moon and the stars Sam Come with me really quick . wake up ! you remember the class ? you remember that ? up . What are you talking about ? Can you see those three stars ? You see how the last one touches the horizon ? That 's Orion 's belt . It 's also called the Three Kings and the reason for that is the three Egyptian kings who built the pyramids in Giza built them to mear those stars . So it 's like an aerial staring straight in the face . They all point due east towards Jordan . The mountains of Petra . We got a seatbelt malfunction .

I need you to pull it really hard . you dumbass ! Did he say goodbye ? he didn 't even say goodbye . we 're loaded and ready . and we 'll be ready to press in five minutes . you need to see this .

Hundred miles from the location on that little map there . It 's getting hotter . It 's gotta be around here somewhere . guys . why ?

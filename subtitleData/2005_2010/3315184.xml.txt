I 'm glad you did . I would have been totally dead . Right ? It 's okay . You just got bit . Hey . you know ? and just hope those things don 't make it through the door . okay . What 's the next option ? - Well . we could see what 's out through this way . no more tunnels . I don 't know . We try our luck up top . so our options are or die in the streets . Is that ... pretty much . - ... pretty much the summing up of it ? right ? let 's just go up and look around . See if we recognize anything . Do you think you 'll be okay to walk ? I 'll help you . - We 're at 59th . - We 're at 59th . - Yeah . - We 're at 59th . That 's weird . What ? Yeah . Hello ! Hello ! Marlena ? - What 's wrong ? - Are you okay ? I 'm really ...

We 're taking one last shot at this thing . they 're leveling the whole goddamned city . - Your watch is still working ? - Yeah ? All right . The airlifts are leaving from 40th and Park . Last chopper 's wheels-up at exactly 0600 . then they 'll get you out . thank you . - 58th Street 's right there . move . - Let 's go . go . I couldn 't even really see what happened to her .

I don 't know if I can do that . and then see if there 's a place to cross over onto her roof . And then we could find some way down to her place . that 's a bad idea . that 's a bad idea . I take that back . they listen to me . Great . Shit . Shit . Probably not working . - What 's going on ? - Not working . wait . Let 's just ... Maybe ... - No ? No ? - Shit . why don 't you take the stairs ? You guys see that guy 's face when Lily asked him what it was ? they have no idea . Hud .

 Transcript : swsub Subtitles : sub-way ( V.1.00 ) My name is detective Brett Hopper , and this is the day that changes everything . Put your hands up ! You 're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza . I will be framed for murder . Who the hell are you , people ? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger . I know all this , because I am living the same day ... over and over again . The day is the same , but different things happen . Every day , I get another chance . For every decision , there 's a consequence . I 've been investigating an old murder . Where am I supposed to look ? A little closer to home . Your old man was on the right track with the girl . My father worked on a case . It may be the key to this day . Yeah , Jen , it 's me . We need to talk . It 's about dad . I 'm wondering if you have any of his old stuff ... I 'll call you back later today . And I think my sister knows more than she 's telling . This is an example - of how we burry our secrets . - I understand . Now , I have to find out what she 's hiding . - Brett Hopper ? - Yeah . What exactly are you looking for ? Temporal lobe epilepsy . Hippocampus looks normal . No asymmetry or atrophy . I don 't see any sign of neoplasms , no apparent lesions , no intracranial trauma . Then it 's all good ? On first look , no offense , but your brain ... Nothing special . Do you have a family history with this sort of thing ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna go and see my sister later , so ... I can ask her . Hello ? Brett , what are you doing here ? Where were you ? At the emergency room . James had an asthma attack . - I didn 't know he had asthma . - No , you wouldn 't , would you ? - What does that mean ? - Why are you here ? - The police are looking for you . - I know . I just had to drop by and pick up some of dad 's old stuff . Case files . Cops stuff ... I don 't have any of that . Talk to mom . Jen , come on , be real . - Why don 't you take the kids inside ? - Randall , it 's alright . No , it 's late . Take the kids inside . - I 'm not finished with my sister yet . - Tonight , you are ! Do you really wanna do this now ? Here ? Cops said they were running cars by here regularly until they catch you . Are you threatening me ? Won 't you leave us alone , Brett ? You 're good at it . Why is he asking for our dad 's stuff now ? Do you think he knows about the briefcase ? I 'm not sure . You 're up early . Hey , baby girl , yeah . I 've got a big day ahead of me . - I 've gotta go to see somebody . - Anyone I would know ? It 's my mom . Your mom ? I thought the two of you don 't talk ? She talks plenty . I wouldn 't be doing this , if ... I didn 't have to . You know , one of these days , you 're gonna have to tell someone in your family about us . - Unless , for some other reason ... - Believe me , I 'm sparing you . Brett ... Look . The only reason I 'm going , is to pick up some of my dad 's old stuff . - Okay ? - Okay . See you later . Word is you killed two ex-sheriff 's deputies . How you are doing ? Thanks , fellows . - What the hell ? - Relax ! We got him ! Everything 's gonna be fine . You 're gonna go to school , you 're gonna teach . You will act like it 's a normal day . What if ... - they come back ? - Then ... I will take care of it . Maybe we should call someone . You wanna call Brett again ? How many times did you call him last night ? Did he pick up ? Did he try to call back ? No ! I know ... You 're right . He 's never been there for us . We will get through this . I promise . Come in . So these are ex-sheriff 's deputies ? I think these are the guys that are framing me for Garza 's murder . Why would a couple of ex-cops wanna pin a DA 's death on you ? They 're just soldiers , but if I can ID them , I think I can figure out who they work for . All I got to go on is a photo ? I was hoping you still had friends over there at county . Yeah , I can ask around . But if it is true that some ex-cops are involved , then ... we both gotta be careful who we talk to . I know . Where are you headed ? To my mom 's . I 've gotta go dig up some old ghosts . Thanks . Mamma , it 's me ! I know . I received a phone call this morning . You 're wanted for murder and you didn 't tell me ? I didn 't do it , mamma ! Of course not . I didn 't raise a murderer . But that 's not the point ! Don 't worry , I 'll be out of here before your husband gets home . His name is Henry . Are you gonna to talk to me about this Brett , or am I gonna have to read it in the papers ? Look , mamma . I 'm here so I can clear my name . Well , running never solved anything ! I 'm sure if you turn yourself in , they 'd find this was a big misunderstanding . Please , just listen to me . I know this all set up has to do with a case daddy worked 15 years ago . I need his files . You came for your father 's things ... Your father and I divorced long before he passed . What makes you think I kept anything of his ? Jen told me you did . Well , I didn 't . All of his things are in storage . Jen knows that , she 's the one that put them here . Do you know where the storage place is , mamma ? Of course , I do . Mamma , there was a stop sign , back there ! They just put that in , I 'm not stopping for that ! How was you sister when you saw her ? I 'm wanted for murder , and all you can ask me about is Jen ? I 'm just hoping you didn 't bring in this trouble to her door . She got a family to think about . She 's just fine . She 's stronger than you think . Believe me , I know . When are you gonna find someone special ? - You could use a woman 's touch . - Yeah . Or a bullet to the head . So , you wanna do drinks ? Yeah , sure ! I 've always had a sauce pot for you boys at county . Hey ! While I have you on the line , I was wondering , if I email you something , can you put some names on faces for me ? Battle ! I gotta call you back . You 're late . What are you doing ? Working ... Is your work more important than your career ? Who are they ? Suspects . What 's the case ? A crime ... They 're a couple of guys who might be connected to the Garza murder . Who asked you to look into it ? - Was it Hopper ? - It 's personal . So ... You wanna do that meeting now , or what ? Meeting 's off . I don 't understand . The police wanna talk to me about Brett . Just go with the detective . Answer his questions . Don 't panic . - What if those men call ? - They won 't . We already gave them what they were asking for . We didn 't give them everything . - Maybe I should go to the bank . - Everything 's gonna be fine . OK , I 'll pick up the kids , we 'll be waiting for you at home when you get back from the station , OK ? This has nothing to do with us . What 's all the whispering about ? Is somebody telling secrets ? It 's a good thing you came here . Of course , I never thought it 'd take 8 years for you to show up and weed through all of this . What 's all my stuff doing here ? That was you father 's doing . He always held on to your things . I thought I lost all this . - I never knew that he ... - They 're all gone ! - What ? - Your father 's notes . They were stacked in a dozen boxes against this wall . Well , does anybody else have a key besides you and Jen ? Well , Nick . - He helped us back then . - Uncle Nick ? I suppose it makes sense if he took them . They were partners for years . I hope he did take them . And burned them . Uncle Nick ! Are you out of your damn mind , coming here ? Get your ass inside . Haven 't heard from you in months , now there 's this non-sense ? - News travels fast . - Are you kidding ? There 's retired cops all over this marina . I need any of my dad 's files you might have taken out of storage . Are you calling me a thief ? Well , I asked Jen if she had them , she said no and neither does my mother . That leaves you . I never took anything out of that place . No offense , but it 's something she just don 't wanna be reminded of , you know . Look , I just need any notes , files , connected to this one case I 'm looking into . It was a Jane Doe , I find out her name is Isabella Contreras . - You remember it ? - No . Are you sure ? You know how many of those we saw ? And I can 't remember all , kid . She was found on the back seat of a car . This hourglass was next to her . Prints came up , Miguel Dominguez . Ringing any bells ? Truth be told , if you saw my name on a police report , chances are I was out in that car , asleep and worn-off . Your dad covered my ass more times than I can remember . The evidence went missing . Pages from the murder book disappeared . - It happens . - You know something ! - Don 't go there kid . - Don 't go where ? - You 're gonna hit an old man ? - What did you drag my father into ? He came to me ! What ? Your dad and I were told to make the case go away . So we did . We looked the other way . You happy now ? You know , I got your first mess . You didn 't have to leave any more . I 've got cops asking questions about your book . In connection with the Garza murder . What are you gonna do about it ? You know , apparently you 're forgetting how this works . You see , you owe me . When you owe somebody a big favor , you don 't ask the questions . I 'm warning you . Regardless what happened between us in the past , I do not respond well to threats . Let 's just hope you have more control over yourself than you did that pretty little wife of yours . You know , maybe I ought to pay her a visit . Just still live over there in what was it , Fairfax ? What ? Are you crazy ? I 'm a cop ! Cop or not , I still own your ass . Good luck getting the murder book now ! Randall , it 's me . I 'm home . I don 't see your car . Hello ? Press play . Daddy ! Where are you ? Daddy ! It 's gonna be okay , guys . Everything 's gonna be fine . Jen ... You need to do something . They 're ex-L.A. county deputies , yeah . All right , thanks . Yeah , it 's Battle . I 'm sending you an e-mail . Yeah ? Battle . I 'm sending you an e-mail . Did you check the records ? All right , thanks . Con name 's Fencik ? How about the other one ? Spell it . Buchalter . Thank you . My office ! Now ! I wanna know why you 're looking into these guys . And don 't gimme that crap about it being personal . I told you . It has to do with Garza . Hopper put you up to this , didn 't he ? Hopper 's a fugitive . If he had contacted me , I would 've informed my lieutenant . So ... tell me something . How does the other guy look ? You 're acting petty cocky for someone with so many secrets . Paying off drug dealers to cover up for a dirty habit . Well , we all have secrets . I 'm more than willing to face up to mine . Are you ? These guys 're friends of yours ? You tread into dangerous ground , detective . Because if they 're involved in a murder , you should probably talk to robbery homicide . Last I checked , you worked narcotics . Why don 't you go back down there ? He was a good man , your dad . Always had my back . He had great instincts . He taught me a lot . He helped me get sober . I owed him my life . So , understand ... if he told me to do something , - I did it . - So he made you a dirty cop . We weren 't dirty . You know what it 's like out there , it 's a numbers game . Sometimes you gotta let one go so you can clear ten others . It 's survival . I never had to turn my head to survive . You 're in narcotics . What about all the crap you let your informants get away with just so you can keep using 'em ? No , huh ? I guess you 're above all that . That hourglass you got ... You say Garza sent it to you ? And he sent a picture to Jen . Garza was a prosecutor your dad went to with this stuff . My father knew Garza ? That Jane Doe case ... Your dad thought he had a suspect . This Dominguez guy ? Trouble was he was locked up in Pelican Bay at the time . But your dad went to Garza with the case anyway . So if he went to a prosecutor , he had to have something solid . All I remember is he called in the morning , excited . But then that night ... he comes to me ... scared . Like I 'd never seen him . He says the all thing 's finished . Whatever he found must have freaked out some higher ops . Higher ops how do you mean ? You saw the murder book on this thing . It 's like Swiss cheese . No autopsy reports , no evidence logs . All our original notes from the scene rewritten . You know what it takes to pull that off ? I don 't know who gave the order to clean the house on this , but it was somebody way over our pay grade . You think my father gave over his notes ? Your dad was a dog with a bone . If he kept that stuff , I wouldn 't be surprised . So then somebody had to take them from storage . If you think it was me ... be my guest . Search the place . But if you ask me ... cop to cop ... your mom ... your sister ... One of them is holding out on you . Thank you . This is Jen , please leave me a message . Jen , it 's Brett . Where the hell are you ? I hope you understand how serious this is . Please , this is everything you asked for . Take it . And just give me my family back . That 's all that 's left . I don 't know what else to do . We got a problem . What happened to you ? A cop . Which one ? Shelten . He went for the murder book . He came back with all sorts of question about Garza . I want to take him out . I like what you did with Shelten . You owned him , you knew his secrets . Secrets are only good if a man 's afraid they 'll get out . We might have passed that point with him . I think we can kill two birds with one stone here . Just get the murder book . I 'll handle the girl in the car . No , they should have come to the emergency room . A little boy with an asthma attack . James Mathis . I 'm trying to find James . Ok , thank you . No , no , there 's nothing up to ... Holy crap . For every decision , there 's a consequence . Daddy ! Where are you ? Daddy ! It 's gonna be OK , guys ! Everything 's gonna be fine . Jen , you need to do something . You know what they want . You have to get it . Andrea , I can 't talk right now . Listen , Hopper , I 've got some info about those guys on the photo . Fencik and Buchalter . Wait , Fencik and Buchalter ? It 's their names ? Yeah , I got their names and numbers from a friend at county . But here 's the crazy part : I think Chad knows them . - What ? - Yeah , I showed him the photo today and he 's been acting weird ever since . Hold on . Where are you ? Following Chad , he just stopped at an ATM machine . Olympic and Hope . Olympic and Hope ? He was gunned down at an ATM on Olympic and Hope . Andrea , you 've got to get to Chad immediately , right now ! Hopper , hold on . I think someone 's coming . Forget about that . You need to get to Chad now ! He 's in danger ! Andrea , listen to me ! You need to get to Chad now ! Hopper , wait . Your sister 's here . Jen is there ? I gotta go . I call you tomorrow . Ok , bye Mom . What are you doing here ? Oh God , she 's got a gun ! What ? Drop it , Jen ! I can 't ! What the hell is going on ? Put your gun down ! Don 't do this , Jen . They 're gonna kill them ! What is she talking about ? Put your gun down ! They made me do this . Made you do what ? What are you doing ? They made me do it ! Just calm down . Come on , let 's talk about this . - Put the gun down , now . - We 'll help you ! I 'm so sorry . Battle ! Call 911 ! This is detective Battle , I need an ambulance at the intersection of Olympic and Hope . For every decision there 's a consequence . I 'll break into his car and take it . Decision ... consequences . Decision ... Where is the package ? What did you do with it ? - I don 't know anything ... - I don 't believe you ! ... consequences . I have it ! ... consequences ... What is wrong with you ? Look , I 'm sorry if I don 't have time for the perfect family ... It 's not about being perfect ! It is about being there ! She didn 't . For every decision , there 's a consequence . Everybody dies . I can 't stop it . You can 't . Brett , you gotta go . You gotta go . There are cops everywhere . You gotta go now . They 'll catch you if you stay . Brett , what are you doing ? - You 're OK . - What ... is it ? - Is it Mom ? - No , it 's not Mom , it 's you . We need to talk . - Now ? - Yeah , right now . - Brett , this isn 't really a good time . - Jen , you can 't keep avoiding me . I don 't hear from you for weeks and you come to my house , and you act like I 'm the one avoiding you ? - What is that ? - I know about the photo in the shed . And the bruises on your arms . - How do you know that ? - It doesn 't matter how I know . You have to tell me what 's happening . - You wouldn 't understand . - It 's not gonna end well if you don 't tell me what 's going on . Now Jenny , please . Just let me in . There ... - These men . - OK . They came to me ... And ... - I took care of it . - No . Tell me what these men wanted . Nothing ... Junk , Dad 's old stuff . No , they didn 't find what they were looking for . And they 're gonna come back , unless you give it to them . - How could you possibly know that ? - Jen , just tell me what they want . Okay ? Please ... You wanna check on the kids ? What the hell are you doing here , Brett ? Are you a part of this ? - Do you know what 's going on ? - Do you ? Do you have any idea what we 've been through ? Believe me , I do . Now just get this ... Do you think you can do worst to me than they 've already done , Brett ? They hurt her ! Do you think that doesn 't ... kill me ? Do you think I 'm just okay with that ? Now you probably think I should just march out there and shut them , right ? Yeah , that 's what you would 've done ! But I can 't be that guy , Brett . Because I have a family . You don 't understand the danger that you 're in . We took care of it , okay ? It 's done ! It 's not done ! Okay , I don 't care if you hate me , so long as you believe me when I tell you that they will kill you , Jennifer and all of your children , like it 's nothing ! I have seen it ! Now whatever it is you didn 't give them , Jen and I have to get ... Today . We have to get it now , Randall ! We have to get it now . I 'm trusting you here . I know . I 've told you . I have no idea where Brett is . What about your wife ? Any idea where we can find her ? She 's ... taking the kids to school . If she shows up ... Have her call me . Let me know when she does , she could be in danger . Danger ? What are you talking about ? I mean ... You mean Brett ? He would never ... You 'd be surprised what people can do when they 're desperate . If I were you , I did your kids go home where it 's safe . I 'll send a patrol of cop by later to check on you . I don 't understand , it 's money . Like ... What 's here , seven-eight thousand dollars ? There used to be more . How much more ? Maybe ... A hundred ... Thousand . So you took it ? We needed it . We 're having another baby ! Randall was out of work , we had a mortgage to pay . You put your family in jeopardy for a couple of days off and some new curtains ? That was Dad 's dirty money . - What do you want ? Your shares ? - It 's not about the money , Jen ! You weren 't there . Dad shot himself ! Who do you think dealt with the body ? Who do you think made funeral arrangements ? Did you think the coroner cleaned up the blood ? What 's sure is that it wasn 't you . You wanna know where I was when I got the call about Dad ? Under cover . Surrounded by a bunch of low life scum who were gonna blow up my brains if they knew I was a cop ! I don 't care where you were when you found out ! - But where you were after ? - I was doing my job . - That 's what Dad would have wanted ! - Dad was dead ! Well , we weren 't and you just disappeared ! You never called for help ! Why didn 't you call me for help ? Our father kills himself . And I have to ask ? You were his son ! You 're not gonna drag me into this , Jen . You 're not gonna drag me into this . This doesn 't make sense . Why would this people shake down a school teacher - for a hundred thousand dollars ? - OK , stop it ! Could you for once stop being a cop and just be my brother ? Could you do that ? Could you ? I never stopped being your brother . I don 't understand why he did it . - Why he left this on me . - He didn 't leave this on you . I did . But I 'm here now . And I 'm not going anywhere . I spent the money . - I don 't ... - So we 'll give them what we have . If they don 't like it ... they 're gonna have to deal with me . Hopper 's sister wasn 't at school so I spoke to the husband . The guy was nervous . Tell you , he 's hiding something . Some people just don 't like cops . I wouldn 't be surprised his sister 's in on it . The apple doesn 't fall far of that tree . - What are you talking about ? - The old man , I worked for him for five years , the guy was dirty . I never of heard that . You were in high school . Everyone knew he was on the take . Well , so you saw this or you heard ? The guy is at department , at D3 with 25 years in , set for life , then he eats a bullet ? Sounds like someone with a clean conscience to you ? - That sounds like a shame . - A shame ? The guy takes the easy way out and everyone here clears so the family 'll get the pension . So what ? The guy was a cop . - And you look out for blood ? - What is your problem ? The guy was dirty , he doesn 't deserve anything . What have you got against Hopper 's dad ? Look , the only Hopper that I care about put three bullets in Alberto Garza . What is this ? Are these those ... Keep the case in the car . - What is going on ? - Stay in the car . My children ! - Where are they ? - They 're inside , they 're fine . They 're fine . Jen , these men ... they want the briefcase . Give them the briefcase , Jen . Please ... - You have to give it to them . - I got what you want . I 'll give it to you . Nobody gets hurt . Jen , go get the case . Everything 's gonna be okay . I 'm gonna fix this . Take it ! Are we good ? We 're good . Oh my God ! Oh my God , you guys ... Come here , come here ... I 'm sorry , Jen . I 'm so sorry . James has just said that he wants to go to school barefoot . You okay ? I don 't know . Honey , everything 's gonna be fine . - We can get through this . - No ... It 's not that . I feel ... different . Different ? What do you mean ? I don 't know , I just feel it . Things are gonna be different today . Aren 't they different every day ? I can understand you 're scared . But we can handle this . I 'm gonna call Brett . Are we talking about the same Brett ? Jen , you 're the one who 's always saying we can 't count on him for anything ! That was our father 's money . I have to tell him . He 's my brother . I 'm so terrified . What if these men wanted the money ... and I spent it ? When I woke up this morning though , I had a thought . These men , they don 't seem like they need money . I was thinking the same thing . So if they don 't want the money , then what ? - Well , the lining 's different . - So ? What is that ? It 's an autopsy report . Who is Isabella Contreras ? She 's a girl that was killed . And he wanted to find out about it . Oh God . What does that mean ? - When she died , she was pregnant . - Those men wanted this ? What am I supposed to do ? - You 're gonna give it to them . - They came to me . - How am I supposed to reach them ? - You 're gonna call this number . You 're gonna ask for Fencik or Buchalter . You 're gonna say who you are and you 're gonna tell them that you have what they want . How could you possibly know those people ? Andrea managed to track them down for me yesterday . So this is all ... they wanted from me ? Isn 't this Dad 's handwriting ? - Yeah , it is . - What does it mean ? I don 't know . I only recognize these two names . So who 's Tobias Booth ? ... and as your councilman , I promise to continue Alberto Garza 's effort . He would have wanted us to remember that hope is bigger than anyone of us . And like his memory , it will carry on . As Alberto used to say , you cannot kill hope ... with a bullet . I 'd like to ... Put it all down . The captain wants the book ... the gang leader ... Hopper .

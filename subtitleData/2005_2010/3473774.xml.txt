 Front door open . Front door open . Front door open . Perfect timing . Cloud just burst . Coming down in all sorts of ways . This should be our last conversation . It 's not safe for you to be seen with me . I 'm touched . Or I would be , if I could imagine that you really care about my safety . What I care about is having an awful lot depending on a man too distracted to pack an umbrella on a cloudy day . Or use a proper razor . Family is a horrible price to pay for what we 're trying to do . and the irony of sacrificing my relationship to my sons to save my sons isn 't lost on me . Well , I 'm sure that Nathan will find that it serves his agenda to forgive you . Of course he will . But Peter , Peter I 'm afraid won 't . He 's said his goodbyes . Now that Danko has thrown Nathan from a building and watched him fly away , it all comes down to you , Noah . Hate to be dramatic , but there it is . Danko doesn 't trust me . Then make him trust you . Get his mind off Nathan , give him some kind of Feather to put in his cap . Give him one of us . If I were a better woman , I 'd suggest you 'd turn me over . That would show him whose side you 're on . What makes you so sure I haven 't ? You need a bigger Feather . Give him Rebel , and Danko will be your best friend . You do realize you may be needing Rebel 's services very soon . I 'm resourceful . I 'll find ways to survive that don 't involve Rebel . I 'm going to leave the city tonight before something unfortunate happens . You 've got 15 minutes to catch the next rail to DC . Take my umbrella . Don 't say I never did anything for ya . Thanks . I wouldn 't go home if I were you . Don 't say I never did anything for you . What is this ? An effective way of stopping any of you from hurting any of us . Neat , huh ? Why didn 't you just do it the old fashioned way and dig a ditch ? This is gun control . Everyone in this room is armed and dangerous , yourself included . Where 's Daphne ? She 's right over there . I 'm afraid she 's not doing very well . Why was she moved from the medical facility ? Well , there was the American tax payer to consider . I wanna speak to Nathan . Nathan Petrelli flew away . Look , this woman is dying . I need to get her to an emergency room . I can 't do anything to help her here . I don 't want you to help her . Then why did you bring me here ? I figure it 'd be a whole lot easier than carrying you . Hook him up . And let 's make up a bed for Ms. Strauss . Heroes SO3E20 " Cold Snap " I brought you a present . New trop 50 . Is that the same line you used on Suresh to get him in here ? No , he needed a little more convincing . In light of recent management changes , it 's important that you and I get along . I couldn 't agree more . So ... happy whatever . Since the puppet man menaced your wife and fugitive daughter , I thought you 'd get some satisfaction out of seeing him strung up . It 's my gift to you . How 'd you catch him ? I 'm smarter than the average bear . Well , since you 're in such a giving mood , allow me to return the favor . How would you like to see Rebel lying here ? I would like that . Very much . He 's hacked into our system twice in the last three days . We 've tracked two messages , both to Tracy Strauss . He 's gonna try to rescue her , and I think we should let him . Hmm ... Bad idea . Strauss is a killer . We 're not setting her loose . You open the cage and let the rabbit run , she could lead us right to Rebel . We both know it 's a trap . I 'm not suggesting we make it easy . And if you don 't catch Rebel ? Then I put a bullet in Tracy Strauss myself , and chalk it up to self defense . Fine . Let the rabbit run . Don 't worry , baby Matt Parkman ! We will make you big again ! Baby Matt Parkman , we will save you . If you understand , shake rattle once for yes , twice for no . Bad baby . No television for you . Hello , baby . You I love ! Why have we stopped ? Don 't stop the car . But the traffic 's stopped . There 's construction-oh ! What do we got ? Where is she ? We lost the target ! Excuse me , I foolishly gave my umbrella to a friend . I hope you don 't mind if I get close . Not at all . Cover all points of interest . They lost Angela Petrelli . I guess someone tipped her . Or she saw them coming . She does that , you know ? She 's on the island of Manhattan . She has a cell phone . We 'll track her signal . It won 't read my Code . Rebel , Rebel . Rebel . Doctor . Oh , God . Wake up . Come on . Come on , you need to wake up ! Where 's Daphne ? Come on . Get up . You gotta wake up . We 're getting out of here . Come on . Wake up . Daphne ! Are you okay ? We have to get her to the hospital . She 's gonna slow us down . Yeah , then she 'll slow us down . Come on . She 'll slow you down . I 'm leaving . No , Tracy , wait ! We all go together ! Open the door ! All clear . So we just walk out the front door ? Yeah . Aren 't you glad you waited for us ? When we get out , I 'm not waiting for anyone . This won 't happen again . If Strauss does lead you to Rebel , kill them both . Chalk it up to self defense . Do you want me to check any sizes , miss ? No , thank you . Actually , could you get me a smaller size in this ? Hello , Tracy . This is one instance where being out for yourself didn 't serve you . You should 've stuck with Matt Parkman . You could have walked right past me , and I never would have known . We did walk right past you . Then you went on your own , and now here we are . I think I can pull this trigger faster than you can turn me to ice , But I don 't wanna take that bet . I 'll take it . While you were playing Abu Ghraib , I was trying to make ice in an oven . This is a breezy 68 degrees , and I 've worked up a hell of a cold snap . Well , like I said , it 's a bet I 'd rather not take . Is everything all right in there , Miss ? Oh . Yeah , I know . No boys allowed . But my fiancee is very self conscious . Would you mind getting this in the size down please ? Thank you . Thanks . Who is Rebel ? I don 't know who Rebel is . Rebel knows who you are . He went to a lot of trouble to break you out . I think he has something in store for you . I suppose you do , too ? Here 's how being out for yourself can serve you better than it has in the past - Lead me to Rebel . How will that serve me better ? Lead me to Rebel , and I 'll let you go . You won 't have your old life back . That 's gone forever . But you 'll be on the outside . And you 'll have a chance . And if I run ? If you run , or if you kill me and then run , there won 't be another conversation . It 'll be a big , fat cut to black , and that 'll be it for you . Help . Help ! I need some help ! Orderly , I need a gurney now ! Matt , where are we ? Honey , it 's fine . You 're gonna be okay . Honey , you 're gonna be okay . Matt , you have to be ready to move . Chest wound septic . Prep for surgery ! Ma 'am , can you tell me your name ? Her name 's Janice . I 'm her husband Matt . This woman 's been shot . What the hell happened ? It was a duck hunting trip upstate , Her family 's idea . Then she shoots herself . Just stupid , a clumsy accident . Her dad 's a doctor . He patched her up . He said she 's gonna be fine , but she 's clearly - She is not fine . Okay . We have to report all gunshot wounds to the police . This was clearly an accident . But this clearly was an accident . I should stick close , make sure she 's okay . You should stick around , make sure she 's okay . - She is gonna be okay - - We 'll do our best . Excuse me . Life from lifelessness . No , baby . Bad baby . You 're not from the baby sitting service . Are you currently a Federal Bank of Washington DC customer ? Tracy Strauss , get free access to our savings program . We 'll match 100 % of your savings for the first three months . Get free checking , online banking , and more with Federal Bank of Washington DC . Please wait for your receipt . Thank you . Taxi ! Union station , please . Taxi . Oh , I thought you said you were gonna be late . Oh , my God . Hello , Millie . You look like you 've been mugged , and the first thing they stole was your dignity . Havin ' a bad day . Let me tell you about my day . It 's been exceptional . I was detained by people with badges for three hours . Came pounding on my door right in the middle of my pilates session , 10 : 00 a. m . , had all sorts of questions about the company I keep , or kept . So , you can understand why I 'm not in the mood to be ambushed . I 'm in trouble , Millie . I know we haven 't spoken in some time , and I 'm sure after this morning you can and are wondering why . You were never the same after Arthur died . We all saw it . I chalked the moodiness and the shoplifting up to grief , but good lord , Angela . What did you do ? Is it pills ? I have dug my sons a very deep hole , and I 'm just trying to dig them out again . Then you 're here looking for a shovel ? Looking perhaps for a change of clothes , maybe a car , whatever cash you have on you . I need to disappear . - You want my advice ? - No . Turn yourself in . Whatever it is you 're doing , just stop . I mean , just because there 's a road unfurling in front of you , doesn 't mean you have to take it . Well , sorry to have bothered you . For what it 's worth , it was good to see you . Wait . It 's , uh , everything I have in my wallet . It 's ... I don 't know . A couple hundred dollars . Thank you , Millie . Enjoy your lunch . Watercress soup was always a favorite . I 've called the police . They 'll be here any minute . Get going . Mother of Matt Parkman 's child , let us explain . Your baby is in danger . Who are you ? Do you know that your baby is special ? It started during the eclipse , just like it did with his dad . Are you here about what Matt did ? Yes , we are heroes like Matt Parkman . He 's not a hero . He 's a ... terrorist . Honey , can you turn on the TV ? Good . ... A suicide attack on the capitol building by former Los Angeles police officer Matt Parkman was thwarted by federal authorities Tuesday night . Senator Nathan Petrelli was present ... I came straight home when I saw this on the news . Matt Parkman wouldn 't . Someone made him do that . Yes , they want everyone to think that we are the terrorists so they can justify what they 're doing . Diabolical . " We are the terrorists " ? You mean like the people that can read minds or whatever ? I am currently powerless , but Ando ... People like us are being arrested . By who ? The government ? Yes . They 're rounding us up . And they 're coming for little Matt . We were sent to help . The government is coming for my son ? He 's just a baby . He 's no threat . That must be the police . I never called the police . Janice Parkman ? Yes . We have a warrant to bring you and your child in for questioning . Uh , I assume this is about my ex-husband . Yes , ma 'am . Why do you need to question my son ? He 's never met his father , and he can 't talk . The warrant is for you and your child , ma 'am . Is the child home ? He 's at the baby sitter 's . I could take you there if you like . That would be appreciated , ma 'am . Okay , I 'll just get my things . Search the house . What ? W - I 'm sorry we couldn 't save you , baby Matt Parkman . Yatta ! Can you say " yatta " ? No ? Oh , it 's okay . You convinced them I was Gwen Stefani ? Uh , yeah . It got you a good room , didn 't it ? How long have I been out ? Two days . The doctors have been pumping you full of antibiotics to kill the infection , but nothin ' but the best for Gwen . I thought I was duck-hunting Janice , the " I 'm an idiot with a gun " story . And who is duck-hunting Janice ? Um , Janice is , uh , uh , Janice is my wife . Well , she was . She 's my ex-wife . So the idiot with a gun story is true ? Uh , yeah , except no one got shot . Anyway , I needed a believable back-story , so I - You slotted me into your ex-wife 's life . Yeah , I guess . Yeah . Why ? Was that wrong ? No , I mean - It 's just enlightening . You know , you needed a believable back-story , 'cause you and me , we don 't really have one . Yes , we do . Do I have clothes ? Yeah , they 're - Matt , you had a dream that we were married , So you think that 's a reason for us to be together . Turn around . We are supposed to be together , and I didn 't dream it . I went on a ... spirit ... Walk . You got baked in the desert . That 's not a lot to hang a relationship on . I 'm hanging our relationship on the fact that I love you . Whatever we had or have , it 's all in your head . I don 't wanna be your surrogate Janice . No , no , you 're not . You 're ... You 're not . It was nice meeting you , Matt , and ... that 's the first time I 've ever said that to anybody and actually meant it , so ... It was nice meeting you . No , you have to stay . You gotta stay here with me . I mean , what if they catch you ? I 'm not gonna slow down long enough for anyone to catch me . Not even you . Westbound metroline now boarding . Departs in ten minutes . Track eleven . We 're sitting next to each other . Hope you don 't mind . Micah ? What are you doing here ? I 'm Rebel . Get over here . What have you gotten yourself into ? I 'm helpin ' people . People like us . I thought we could help together . - Micah - - Listen . I know you 're not my mom , but you don 't have anybody else . Is something wrong ? I didn 't know that it was you . I led them right to you . Who-you led who ? Wait , you 're bait ? I didn 't know that it was you . Doesn 't matter who you thought it was . How could you do that to anybody ? I thought there was a good chance they 'd follow you . I just didn 't think that you 'd be in on it . Attention , union station passengers . This way . A gas leak has been detected in our basement food court area . A station-wide evacuation is in progress . Excuse me . Ma 'am ? Can I help you ? Ma 'am ? You must have been a boy scout . What 's the boy scout motto ? Be prepared ? Yeah , clearly you weren 't a boy scout . 'Cause I 'm a girl ? 'Cause the first rule of scout law is to be trustworthy , and , uh , you suck at that . I know . I 'm not proud of myself . I don 't understand you . You got into politics to protect the civil liberties of the everyday American . God , you read my bio ? I read everything on you , okay ? I thought that meant I knew you . I thought that because you looked like my mom - that I knew you . If I met you earlier in my political career , maybe I 'd be more like my bio , but I 'm not that person . I 'm not your mom . I know . You 're nothing like her . My mom , who was the everyday American , was a hero . You 're just a politician . Who are you ? Che Guevara ? Che Guevara led a revolution . This is a rebellion . So whose side are you on ? And " mine " is not an answer . Can you tell the sprinklers what to do ? I can tell the fire alarm to tell the sprinklers what to do . Then tell them to make it rain in here . Find a way out . Come with me . I can 't . Keep doing what you 're doing , Rebel . Go . And Micah ! Stay ahead of the ice . She said she had a hell of a cold snap . Any sign of Rebel ? No . Don 't worry , baby Matt Parkman . You will see your mother again when it 's all safe . She 'll be very proud of you . You 've been very brave . You didn 't cry even once . But if you want to cry , it 's okay . If you feel like crying , you can . But when time starts again , you have to be brave . Yes . Your attention , please . Bus 352 to San Bernardino and Las Vegas is now departing . Hiro ? Penny for your thoughts . Since when did you start paying people for their thoughts ? And , more importantly , how 'd you find me ? You love Paris like I love y - Don 't . You got here awfully fast . How 'd you get here ? I flew . How 'd you get here ? I ran on water . So , you 're Mr. Concord now ? You read minds . You don 't ... fly . All right . You ... are flying . I didn 't know you could fly . I didn 't know you could run on water . I can run on anything . Except air and the vacuum of space .

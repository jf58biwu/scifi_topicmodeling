 Sync by honeybunny ( answering machine ) hi , this is lucy . leave me a message . ( beeping ) Are you okay ? mmm . what happened ? I don 't know- - i feel- - I feel a little sick . i 'm sorry i overreacted . You were right . We should get to symacore . Yeah ... yeah , we should . Um , maybe we could go inside first . Okay . okay . Mmm . You have no idea how much i 've longed for this . ( woman ) good morning , six ! Good morning . we all dream of finding our perfect partner . Well , now , it 's your turn to be matched . I 'm here to tell you about your appoint- - Appointment with the modern love bureau . ( six ) you 've gotta be kidding me ! Let science take the risk out of- - Out of the romance . Our high-tech syst-system Can find you the soul mate you deserve . ( six ) this came under my door this morning . Well , it 's the way couples get together here . Why don 't you try it ? And what would be the point ? Well , you might meet someone you like . you might learn something about yourself . Or-or maybe you already know everything there is to know About six and his feelings . What is it ? Something to do with the weather . Ambiance anomaly , apparently . Whoa , don 't slip . ( woman ) we usually begin by asking our clients to talk about themselves a little bit In a relaxed but revealing sort of a way . It 's best if you don 't look directly into the camera , As you talk , as it can come over As rather hectoring to a potential match . You really think you can manufacture love ? Since the introduction of blink-match technology , new data shows that extramarital affairs Are down to a new low of 18 % in matched marriages . Blink-match technology . That 's great . We have enough to make a blink personality splice . ( typing on keyboard ) I know what you 're trying to do to me . You 're trying to fix me up with some woman , some distraction . I 'm not staying here . I must admit , i find it sexy When a man has a touch of rebellion in him . I like the sparks . ( giggling ) I have the same thing . I-i like a relationship with a little edge to it . A man with a touch of mystery about him Makes me feel curious about him . What do you think , six ? She 's free tomorrow . Would you like to meet her ? What ? was that okay ? I just want to- - i want to lie here for a while . Is that okay ? Why not ? Can i let you into a secret ? I looked in your file . ( six , laughing ) i hope you don 't mind . No vacation . No relationships . I guess all those reports got to me a little bit . Let 's go . What ? do something . In fact , hit the enemy where it hurts . Okay . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . ( laughing ) i-i-i don 't know what is up with me tonight . ( two ) do you think there 's a part of you that wants to betray him ? No . No part of me . I think there is . Or else , why do it ? Please . Oh , of course , you have no choice in the matter . Let 's not pretend it is otherwise . You are a dreamer , 313 . And dreamers vanish , as you know . But betrayal , It 's such a fascinating human attribute . And since we are passing the time of day here tonight . Do i like you ? I don 't know . You don 't know me . Do you dream ? Do you tell yourself there will be a moment To somehow spring free from all of this And explain to him the impossibility Of your predicament ? You were noble , decent , admirable . You didn 't really forsake him . And you will be a liar . indulge me . To betray someone you love . And i don 't mean to catch my hand in the filing cabinet . Thursday afternoon ... I mean to fundamentally betray someone you love . That is ... Would i like you , if i knew you ? I don 't know . I 've long believed that we look for beauty In all the wrong places . You see , if you betray the one person you love , Then there must be something you want more Than to hurt his love . Hmm . Well , he 'll be with us soon enough . ( sighing ) Ah ... Good morning , six . Time for matching- - ( doorbell ringing ) Time for matching stage two . I-i 'm 415 . Really ? I 'm not what you expected ? Oh , yes , you are . You 're exactly what i expected . ( giggling ) There was something in your voice . i don 't miss that kind of thing . Those matching people know their stuff , huh ? Can i ask you about yourself ? Jump in . What do you wanna know ? I don 't know . Uh , where do you live ? Over the bridge , apartment 415 . But-but you haven 't lived there long ? Ever since i left my parents ' home . Are you sure ? I think i would know . ( giggling ) you 're kinda strange , six . I like it . You can ask . It 's okay . How did it happen ? There 's nothing wrong with my eyes . I was six years old . I woke up one morning , and they 'd stopped working . They said it was caused by some kind of trauma . Something happened when i was asleep . do you mind ? Nice bones . I like . I feel like i know you already , Like we 've met before in some whole other life . ( nervous laughter ) six , you really are strange . But you mean it- - i can hear that . Four-fifteen , i 'd like to get to know you . Well , that 's what we 're here for . I 'd like to get to know you tonight . Oh . ( 415 ) this isn 't like me , you know , really . ask anyone who knows me . No surprises . No sudden moves . And then , all this . It 's like the dials are spinning And here i am , letting go . Maybe that 's it . What ? Maybe that 's how love takes us . We should . Okay . What was that ? Oh , the purpose for , um , but then- - Who needs purpose ? Did anyone tell you- - You have the most enchanting eyes ? Are you sure you 're okay ? Just some kind of bug . ( scrambling noise ) What is it ? What if it 's true ? What if we had ... What if we had one night together In some other life , before the village ? Six , no one can be so hopelessly romantic . What if i know it 's real ? That i can remember it ? Remember us ? Come here . You were standing in the window , Just like this . Lucy ? What did- - what did you call me ? You know something , don 't you ? Well , yes- - i know it 's crazy to talk like this . Some other life . I have to go . I 'm sorry- - i promise you . I won 't talk about these crazy things . I promise you . okay . Let 's just slow it all down , okay ? I 'll go now , and i 'll see you tomorrow . You and me , in this other life , Where did our story end ? I don 't recall . ( moaning ) You 're a friend of six 's . six trusts you . You 'll have to ask him that . I already did . Oh . What are they ? I want to know what 's in them , What they do . Look , i 'm not a chemist . I can 't- - but you can find out for me . I have a question for you . Is six a crazy ? No- - no , he 's not . You want to know about her ? About six ? It 's all right , 1112 . It was always my intention to tell you . I didn 't bargain for six pushing things along . If you know , it will change everything . There will be no going back to innocence . I want to know . You want to know . about your mother ? To know about my mother . I should report it , right ? Should i report it ? ( six ) could be a way outta here . ( woman ) cake 's out of the oven ! I 'm gonna have some cake And , uh , then maybe i 'll report it . Eight-three-two ! wee ! I 'll call the clinic before they find out About this thing . ( laughing ) She likes you , six . I think it 's the cake she likes . Yeah-yeah , i wanna report something in my garden . How did your date go , six ? She knows something , but she won 't admit it . All righty , who 's going to make the toast ? ( cork popping ) Ooh ! Even i have to admit There must be something to this matching thing , If it brought you two together . ( chuckling ) la-la-la-la-la-la . Cheers . cheers . Where 's 8-3-2 ? De-da-la-la-la-de-da . Wee ! Eight-three-two ! Eight-three-two ! Eight-three-two ! Eight-three-two ! Eight-three-two ! Hey , what are you doing ? Hey , get off of me ! What are you doing- - my baby is down there ! ( indistinct chatter ) You left the door open . ( reporter ) in the latest move to combat ambiance anomalies , the clinic has announced that every home is to be given a pig . studies have shown conclusively that swine breath is a proven atmosphere stabilizer , and scientists are confident that this will reduce significantly the risk of further disturbances in the short to medium future . moreover , if you order now , you can get two . Some friends of mine have lost their child . She 's fallen down into a hole . it 's not the weather ! People want something they can believe in , six . It is the weather . They want to come together and make a difference . They volunteer for pig distribution duties . They love that ! And then , we can all get on with our wonderful lives , Our families , our romances . And what about you , six ? Don 't you have a head full of her , hmm ? Tell the truth- - tell yourself the truth . Wouldn 't you rather be with 4-15 , hmm ? Aren 't you just longing to be at her ? Know what i mean ? At her ? Isn 't that more human ? No . It 's destroying them , My friends , not knowing where their child is . ( two ) the only way of knowing , the only possibility of getting the child back Is to go after her . You choose , you decide . Well , if you 're telling me I can go there and save that little girl , I 'll do it . And you 'd do that without knowing what 's down there , For someone else 's child ? What is this thing ? It 's a nothing . It 's oblivion . it 's beyond all hope . The child is gone , six . Does he not love her enough , now ? Oh , no . He 's hardly begun . What he feels only scrapes at the skin of love . Let him go where love is terrible . Is it possible to love someone too much ? Does he have to come in here every night ? Love is a torment or it is not love . It 'll crack him right open . And then , we can see the six inside , The inside six . He can 't understand why you don 't kill him . Perhaps , we will kill her when we get to that place . How would that feel ? I don 't want you to kill her . We always save our best lies for ourselves . Do i like you ? Come up to the house . Would you like that ? I 'd like you to sit with me . Sit with me and see . What do you make of this holes business , six ? I know it 's got nothin to do with the weather . I gotta take this thing seriously , you know ? That 's why we 've got ourselves two pigs . We 're a two pig family . Leave that alone ! ( pigs squealing ) come on- - leave that ! She was such an adventurous kid . Damn , i 've asked myself a thousand times . Why my little girl ? Twenty-nine , forty-four ... Has 4-15 been away in the last few weeks ? Away- - where , son ? We 've seen our little girl every single day Since she was- - since ... What did we do wrong ? did we not love her enough ? We still hope , you know , for ... That there will be a little miracle . Now that she 's been matched , she 's so happy . Maybe this is it . What do you say , six ? Are you gonna be the one who 's gonna make it all good as gold ? * oh leave it there * * take your burdens to the lord and leave it there * * if you trust and never doubt * * he will surely bring you out * * take your burdens to the lord and leave it there * * oh leave it there * * take your burdens to the lord and leave it there * What i can tell you , It doesn 't mean that you 'll find her- - I have no medical records for your mother . I 've not examined her . I don 't know what her condition is . Her condition is in those pills . * leave it there * oh leave it there * * oh leave it there * * take your burdens to the lord and leave it there * a sedative . A cocktail of sedatives . Extremely powerful sleeping drug . a hallucinogen , A type i 've never come across before . It contains a compound that 's not in our records . This is ... Well ... This has no known contents . How could they match me with a man like that , huh ? Look at him . He does nothing . Sit with me , 313 . Please , wh-why am i here ? If i touch your hair , you can refuse . We can all refuse . We have choices , So long as we can live with the consequences . Oh , damned consequences , huh ? And if i touch your face , if i touch you here , in this room , she can sense us . i know she can . Oh , it 'd break her heart . i can remove 4-15 , and you can have six all to yourself . No , i want- - i want him to choose . My question for you is the treatment . Can you do it in reverse ? Can you get rid of this longing ? I 'm not sure . B-but , yes . It must be possible ... The , uh , signs can work in a contrary direction , And we can make someone- - Un-love . She 's right- - i ... do ... nothing ! We will not be doing any such thing , of course . Why should we ? But we know that it is there , you and i , If either of us should ever need it . Go and be with him . That is what you want . ( six ) they come in the night and take me . i 'm sure of it . No , six . It 's in your mind , that 's all . Three-one-three , please just help me tonight . I trust you . Stay with me . Two was right . I could 've said no . If you choose her , I don 't know if i can bear that . They 'll , uh ... they 'll be coming soon . So , uh , you just sleep . Just-just sleep . Hmm . Now see how different he looks . he is- - how shall we describe it ? He is touched . we should be amazed by love , by its capacity to make us and to ruin us . But you , 313 , of course , Look how far it 's brought you . You , who know all about consequences . ( gasping ) Oh , 313 . You see what love can do ? 313 , how is it possible ? Your love , six . What is it ? Gene symmetry therapy . we scanned the brains of people Who 'd fallen in love . And we discovered- - and you 'll like this , six- - That the more there was gene similarity Between people , The more they fell in love . And so , we replicated by transplanting 4-15 's genes into you . I feel ... Your emotions are manufactured , six . But what did i feel Before you gave me these feelings ? If you can do this ... What is love ? You defied me , 313 . A little reckless , perhaps . Your punishment is already in you . And now that you know the way of things , six , Do you still want to marry her ? Do you ? Yes . good . Now ... This isn 't me . Somebody is making this happen . i have to go . one thing first . Breakfast . tell me what you want for breakfast . Isn 't that the same ? If we don 't go , isn 't that what they want ? I just want to buy you breakfast . Oranges . Oranges . Hey ! Where are we going with this ? You tell me . I don 't know ... No . i-i feel like saying- - Marry me . Shh ! It 'll keep . You like to push it , don 't you , six ? Yes . Marry me . Go ! Yes . yes ? Yes . ( church bells ringing ) ( collective chatter ) ( 1891 ) i look at the joy i bring to so many lives , and i say to myself , " 1891 , " you make a difference . " 313 ... I didn 't think you were comin ' . Six . Okay , um ... Look , there are two kinds of viruses used In gene symmetry therapy . What i gave you , six , it won 't last . 313 , I want you to be my friend . oh , the veil ! ( giggling ) Celebrate with me . ( gasping ) What- - what is it ? What 's happening ? did he just kiss her ? is that what happened here ? ( six ) honey- - honey ! You really are rather smitten , Aren 't you , 313 ? What you will never know , of course , Is whether your feelings are genuine or- - I have to go . I 'm not safe for you to be around . Whatever you do , stay away . we 'll come back to this- - i promise . What 's going on- - are you okay ? ( choking up ) what if we said- - what if we promised each other We-we 'd always come back to this ? we 'd never let us go ? Lucy ? lucy ? Where am i ? We 're in the desert , lucy . Uh , what did you call me ? We 've met before . I know that for you to hear , This might not make any sense . But you 're called lucy . We met in a place called new york . We had one night together . I am 4-15 . Who are you ? I am 4-15 . Who are you ? I am 4-15 . Who are you ? I am lucy . I-i am lucy . ( sobbing ) i 'm lucy , i 'm lucy . Why did you do that- - the blindness ? Be-because they knew if i looked at you , You would know that they sent me here . I came here to love you . No ! I 'm cured of you ! You tell me why you 're here ! Two brought me here to love you . Two brought me here to break your heart . I 'm glad you 're cured of me . 147 ? I 'm gonna find my little girl , six . But there 's nothing down there . Nothing . If what you want is oblivion , then jump . do it . If it 's too much for you to bear , go . but don 't lie to yourself . don 't lie to your wife . You 're not gonna find your daughter . she 's gone .

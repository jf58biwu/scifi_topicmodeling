 Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes . And you 've gotta be ready . Suzie Costello . Why did you kill those people ? The more I use the glove , the more I control it . If I could get it to work all the time on anything , it could resurrect . I loved this job . I really loved it . At last . You must be Torchwood . My team bitch about you all the time . - And you are ? - Detective Swanson . - I 'm Captain Jack Harkness . - So I 've heard . Tell me something . Are you always this dressy for a murder investigation ? What , d 'you rather me naked ? - God help me , the stories are true . - So who 's the victim ? That 's victims , plural . Yesterday a man was murdered at 96 Oakham Street . Alex Arwyn , 28 , single , estate agent . Here we go . That 's from the scene of crime . Today , in here , we get two more . Mark and Sara Briscoe , both 33 , married . He 's a surveyor . She works in education . What about the smears of blood ? Is that writing ? Work in progress . Come inside and see the finished thing . Oh , my God . Looks like somebody wants your attention . They 've got it . We found a few of the killer 's hairs from the first murder . - Lab results should be in soon . - Good , we 'll need that . Now , if you could just clear the room . Some of this equipment is strictly need-to-know . - Well ... it was only a matter of time . - What was ? Torchwood walks all over this city like you own it . Now these people are paying the price , ordinary people ripped apart with your name written in their own blood . From where I 'm standing , you did this , Captain Jack Harkness . You did it . Still , at least we 've got a head start . If it 's someone we pissed off , that narrows it down to , oh , four or five million ? And that 's just the humans . Tosh , how we doing ? There 's no record of Mr and Mrs Briscoe on our database , nor yesterday 's victim , and no link between him and the Briscoes . No connection between any of them . Here 's the report you asked for , ma 'am . Jack ? They 've got the results on the killer 's hair . Initial findings say Caucasian male , early forties , smoker , drinks tequila . Doesn 't match any DNA profiles . Only thing of interest is a compound we 've never seen before . Recognise it ? - Uh-oh , we 're in trouble . - What is it ? - Compound B67 . - You 're kidding . Retcon . He 's got Retcon in his blood . B67 , a.k.a. Retcon , a.k.a. the magic ingredient of the amnesia pill . And this belongs to us . Whoever this killer is , it 's somebody we gave the amnesia pill to . Is he remembering that he 's a serial killer , or is he becoming a serial killer because of the Retcon ? Wait a minute . I 've taken Retcon . Then better stay away from sharp objects . Ianto , how many people have we given amnesia pills to ? - Two thousand and eight . - Hey , what if they all become psychotic ? - Do you have to sound so happy ? - Yeah , I 'm just saying , Mean Streets . Tosh , narrow the list down to fit Swanson 's profile . Start checking them out fast as you can . You two , there 's gotta be a link between the victims . Find the link , find the killer . Get to it . Jack , if there is a link , why don 't we just ask the victims ourselves ? Not the right time for a seance , thank you very much . The first time I met Torchwood , you had that glove . No way . Not after what it did to Suzie . It brings people back to life . Just for two minutes , we could question the murder victims . That 's exactly what she said . She was one of us , we trusted her , and now she 's dead ' cause of that thing . The glove stays in the safe , where it belongs . These murders are happening because of Torchwood , so Torchwood has got to do something . It fell through the Rift about 40 years ago , lay at the bottom of the bay till we dredged it up . I always figured this wasn 't just lost . Whoever made it , wanted rid of it . You know , we never gave it a cool name . I thought we called it the Resurrection Gauntlet . Cool name . What about the Risen Mitten ? I think it 's catchy . Jack , you okay ? Don 't forget , the maximum resurrection time was two minutes . That 's only ' cause Suzie had practice . The most we 're likely to get is 30 seconds , okay ? - Tosh , you ready ? - Ready . And recording . This man was victim number one , name - Alex Arwyn . Come on , Alex . - Come back . - How does it work ? You just sort of feel like reaching into the dark , finding the dead . I can 't ... I ... I don 't ... Damn ! Nothing . Sorry . Never was very good with this thing . - Owen ? - No , I tried last time . - We all had a go . It only responded to Suzie . - Well , I never had a go . - It 's cold . - It warms up . The glove relies on some sort of empathy , maybe compassion and ... Just be yourself . Somebody help me ! Oh , my God , help me ! Help me , help me ! - Alex , I need you to listen to me . - Somebody help ! Help me ! That 's what we 're doing . Alex , you were attacked . Do you know who it was ? Who attacked you ? - Who are you ? - How long ? - Where am I ? - Fifteen seconds . - Who are you ? - I 'm just trying to help , sweetheart . - I 'm just trying to help . - I want my mum . Please , let me see my mum . - He 's gone . - Let me keep trying . - Gwen , he 's dead . - But I can bring him back . - The glove only works once . - But I can do it . Just let me try ! Gwen , look at me . He 's gone . Amazing . She 's a natural . Twenty four seconds . - Give Ianto a stopwatch and he 's happy . - It 's the button on the top . What do you think , Gwen ? You want to stop ? Recording . Victim number two , Mark Briscoe . Oh , God , I can feel him . It 's like a rope from my heart to the glove . It 's so warm . Hey , there . Just look at me . Look me in the eye . - That 's it . - Where am I ? You 've been hurt . We don 't have long . We need to know who attacked you . - Is my wife all right ? - We 're looking after her . Now , Mark , who was it ? It was that man . - He belonged to Pilgrim . He went to Pilgrim . - What 's Pilgrim ? Oh , my God , he had a knife . No , Mark , he 's gone , but we don 't have long . Quickly , what was his name ? Thirty five seconds . Max . Never knew his surname . Trying Pilgrim and Max . Get a description . You gotta give us something more so we can catch him . - He 's going . - There was ... There was someone who knew him better . That woman . - She was always talking to him . - What was her name ? - Where 's my wife ? - Her name ! Suzie . - One minute , five seconds . - Jack , did I hear that right ? Could be anyone . Must be lots of women called Suzie . Not connected to this case . We 've been talking to the wrong corpse . Pilgrim . A religious support group , more like a debating society . Meaning of life , does God exist , all that stuff . The point is , it was tiny , more like a hobby , run by Mark Briscoe 's wife , Sara . She had all that stashed in a wardrobe . Handwritten and photocopied . That 's why we couldn 't find any records . - She isn 't even online . - No mention of Suzie or Max ? Not a word . She didn 't even keep a register . It wouldn 't be our Suzie , though . She wouldn 't go to that support-group bollocks . How would you know ? I mean , were you friends ? Any of you ? - Who was her best friend in this place ? - She sort of kept herself to herself . Well , then , if she needed to talk , maybe that 's exactly where she 'd go . - A group of complete strangers . - Could be . You 've got a point , Gwen . Time we got to know our deceased colleague a little better . Have I got this right ? When I die , you get to keep all my possessions ? - My whole life 's gonna get stashed in a locker ? - Rules and regulations . - What if I leave all my stuff to Rhys ? - We 'll stash him away , too . Tread carefully , people , with respect . This is the life of Suzie Costello . That 's all we are in the end , a pile of boxes . - Is her father still alive ? - Don 't know . But you must 've looked him up to tell him his daughter was dead . When Suzie left Torchwood , she was on the run . She wiped all her records . I couldn 't retrieve her files . She was good at computers . Well , she was good at everything . She was good at murder , too . Laugh a minute , that was Suzie . - What 's that ? - A book . Emily Dickinson . Poet . Jack ? Pilgrim . She 's part of it . That proves it , then . No choice . It 's time Suzie came back . Do we all get frozen ? Torchwood staff , when we die , do we all get kept ? Rules and regulations . - How long for ? - Forever . Recording . - Have you got your stopwatch ? - Always . I 'll record from my station . I 'm sorry , but I don 't want to look her in the eye . Sorry . Anyone else ? Any advice ? Yeah , I know . Empathy . Even though she did try to kill me . You and me both . I 'm getting a reading . No , it 's gone . Just memories . Nothing living . She 's too far gone . - What do we do now ? - Nothing we can do . That 's it . We 're out of options . There 's always the knife . When she killed all those people , she always used the knife . It 's made out of the same metal as the glove . We 've seen it before . Metallic resonance . Like , the glove works better if the knife 's part of the process , like closing a circuit . - Then let 's use it . - Small detail . The knife was used to kill people . She 's already dead . All right , so we kill her again . Ianto ? Life Knife . Anything ? No , there was just a sort of spark and then it was gone . I 'm sorry , Jack . You 're gonna have to do it properly . What the hell . - Suzie , listen , it 's me . - I 've gotta go . I 've gotta go . - Look around you . Look at where you are . - Can 't stay . They know . I 've gotta go ! Think . Try to remember . Suzie ! Suzie ! Look at me ! Jack ? Oh , my God . - There 's a knife in my chest . Did you kill me ? - You killed yourself , remember ? But ... Oh , my God , I shot myself . - We gotta ask you about Pilgrim . - No . - Wait a minute , didn 't I kill you ? - Never mind that . We need names and details . - Who 's using the glove ? - I 'm sorry . Wouldn 't you know it ? Gwen bloody Cooper . Thirty seconds . When you were in Pilgrim , you gave the amnesia pill to a man - Max . Do you remember ? What ? You brought me all the way back just for Max ? We need to find him . Who is he ? What 's his surname ? He was just some loser ... - We 're losing her . - Stay here , damn you ! - Don 't force it , Gwen . - She 's not getting away this time . Stay here . - No ! - I told you to stop ! It 's all right , it 's all right , I 've got her . I 've got her . Right . Here we go . Hold on . Okay , pulse . Yeah , she 's all right . We need to get her out of here . - Can you come and give me a hand ? - It 's the glove . I told you , they get hooked . All right , don 't make a fuss . It 's over now . - Excuse me . I 'm still counting . - There 's not much point . Suzie 's dead . No , according to the equipment , she 's just unconscious . What the hell 's going on ? Oh , my God . He 's right . She 's alive . Suzie 's still alive . Look at her . She 's bloody breathing ! She can 't be . No . Still breathing . No stopping her . She won 't die . One minute , thirty and counting . How long has it been ? Three months . When can I die ? I just want to go . Can 't you leave me alone ? You seem to be stuck . But ... Am I gonna stay like this ? - For how long ? - Don 't know . - Can I see my father ? - No . You wiped your records . We had no trace of him . - So he doesn 't even know that I 'm dead ? - Well , you 're not any more . This is sick . You started it . Right now , we 've got an investigation underway . Pilgrim . You visited these Pilgrim meetings , gave an amnesia pill to someone called Max . How do we find him ? What for ? What did he do ? He was just an ordinary bloke . We think the Retcon triggered a psychosis . He 's started killing . - How many victims ? - Three . Same as you . We need to know , how much Retcon did you give him ? Owen , hello . You scared to face me ? - You frighten the shit out of me , yeah . - What about Toshiko ? Is she still here ? Yeah , she 's here . All the gang . Happy days . But the amnesia pills , how many did you give him ? One a week , every week , for two years . Christ ! No wonder . What the hell did you do that for ? I just ... I wanted someone to talk to . About this place . It was driving me mad . And he was just ... He listened , that 's all . He just listened . Every week , as soon as I 'd finished talking , I 'd give him the pill . - You overdosed him . - I didn 't know that . Keep getting it wrong , don 't I ? Is that why you brought me back ? Did you think I wasn 't guilty enough ? - What was his surname ? - I don 't know . All I ever did was talk about me . It 's all my fault , isn 't it ? Never bloody stops being my fault . Can 't you just let me die ? You don 't get off that easy . Yeah , you did warn me right at the beginning . He said , " This is the one job you can never quit . " Then let 's get to work . Come on , Suzie . Just like the old days . There 's gotta be something . Hold on , there 's someone missing . This girl came every week . A student , blonde . She 's not in these photos . - Who was she ? - Lucy . Lucy Mackenzie . - She said she worked at a club . - Which one ? I 'm tired . Come on , Suzie . Which club ? For God 's sake , this Max is killing every single member of Pilgrim . Now tell me . Lucy Mackenzie , where did she work ? - Which club ? - Wolf . The Wolf Bar . Cover the exits . Bloody hell . Like I didn 't have a banging headache already . That 's the glove , Gwen . Gets inside your mind . Yeah , all right , Suzie , stop creeping me out . Just tell us , any sign of Max or this Lucy Mackenzie ? Nothing yet . Keep moving round . Keep alert , people . To repeat , Max is described as 40 , 6 ' 3 " , 6 ' 4 " , stocky , short dark hair , tattoo down his left arm . Narrows it down . Can 't even look at me , can you ? It 's not like you to be so judgmental . Not like you to go on a murder spree . All right , so it drives us mad , this job . God knows I 've done some stupid stuff . But now I 've got to keep on working every day in a job that 's got a bit less honor because of you . Wait , I 've got a match on that guy . - Where is he ? - Northwest bar . Show me . Owen , get in closer . Which one do you mean ? Wait , he 's going over to the ... Hang on , wait . I 've got a match on our girl , Lucy Mackenzie , the student . That 's her . That 's definitely her . It 's too late . He 's going over . Got the bastard . What the ... That isn 't him . Gwen , behind you ! That one 's for Ianto . Risen Mitten , Life Knife and that old classic , stun gun . Come on , let 's get him out of here . - You saved my life . - Well , maybe I came back for a reason . Okay , so your name is Max Tresillian . Can you confirm that ? You live at 106 Endeavor Terrace , is that right ? Parents Sandra and Dave , yeah ? You 're inside the Torchwood Facility . And five , six ... Keep watching . Soon as we reach 10 , just stops dead . If this is a drug-induced psychosis , it 's a very specific one . Like he reacts to the word Torchwood . Thanks , Jack . Sorry . But if that 's caused by Retcon , then we 've got a million more problems on the way . Let me know what the scan says . - What about Suzie ? What you gonna do with her ? - No idea . - What do you think ? - You 're the boss . Torchwood . Can 't you ask Jack ? Just one favour . I want to see my father . - Tell us where he is . We could bring him in . - I 'm not letting him anywhere near Torchwood . If he 's still alive . What 's wrong with him ? Cancer . All that waiting , and then I go and die first . I could contact him on your behalf . And say what ? So tell me . Since I 've been gone , you enjoying it ? Yeah , it 's ... Well , you know this place . It 's sort of ... It 's mad , isn 't it ? - Insane . - Bloody nuts . - Best job I ever had . - Me , too . - And the worst . - Yeah , tell me about it . Funny thing is you always imagine , when you 're dead , " Oh , they 're gonna miss me at work . " Indispensable . But look what happened . I got replaced . By someone better . - You got that glove working better than I did . - I just got lucky . No , it 's more than that . The others , they prefer you . - Don 't say that . - You got my job . Almost like you planned it . Except I didn 't . And I 'm sorry , but I 've got my own function at Torchwood . And I 'm a lot more than just a replacement . Have you slept with Owen ? There you go . Replaced me completely . I had a boyfriend who used to walk into rooms like that . The grand entrance . Got kind of boring . Though he was one of twins , so I put up with it . Twin acrobats . Man , I gotta write that book . Maybe even illustrate it . You know , I can talk for a long time . A very long time . Takes me a while to piece things together . - Meaning ? - Suzie had the glove . You put her in charge of it . But tell me , Jack , did you ever ask about her father ? - How do you mean ? - He 's got cancer . He 's been dying , slowly now , for years . And what do you do ? You give his daughter the one device that brings people back to life . - Is it any wonder she got obsessed ? - Oh , so this is all my fault ? Well , isn 't it ? Did you ever stop and think ? Did you ... Did you ever look at Suzie ? Did you ever think what that glove would do to her ? Did you ? Right from the start , you thought Suzie 's death was because of you 'cause it happened when you arrived . Then you brought her back to life , all the way , because you wanted it so much . Okay ? We 're both responsible . - Now what the hell are we going to do with her ? - I don 't know . What if she never dies ? Have you thought of that ? Like undying forever , just you and her . - No way . - Could be . I wouldn 't wish that on her . I 'd sooner kill her right now . - Could you , though ? Kill her ? - Yeah . - Really ? - Oh , yeah . Jack , can you come to the conference room for a sec ? Something I need you to see . Kind of urgent . I was going over Suzie and Gwen 's medical records . I ran them through the Philemon Filter . Watch the footage . This is the moment when Gwen brought back Mark Briscoe , the husband . See ? Now look at his death . You see ? The energy flow stops just as he 's about to die . But have a look at Gwen with Suzie . Whoa . - What is that ? - Energy . Life . But with Suzie , it 's a permanent connection , and she is getting stronger . It 's still going right now . She is draining the life out of Gwen . There 's always a price . More coffee ? Is that all you do ? Just leave me alone . Have a biscuit , at least . Go on . Just for me . The wearer of the glove can bring somebody back , but loses their own life in return . - How do we stop it ? - We gotta kill her . - Suzie 's gotta die . - Again ? - Who 's gonna do it ? - Like you said , I 'm the boss . Toshiko , where the hell 's Suzie ? And where 's Gwen ? - Interrogation Room . - No , they 're not . Find them , fast ! I can 't see them . Hold on , scanning . Nope . Nothing on internal scans . - What 's going on ? Where 've they gone ? - Just keep looking . Bring up the SUV . Still there . I 'll try exteriors . What about Gwen 's car ? What 's she doing ? - Getting herself fired . - Unbelievable ! How stupid is that ? Thinking she could just drive off . Come on , let 's go get them . What the hell ? Ianto ? Ianto ! Captain . - What happened ? - But I thought you must 've done it . - We 've gone into lock down . - Then reverse it . I can 't . It 's 100 % . The doors are sealed . We 're locked in . I 'm taking you to see your dad and that 's it , okay ? Sorry . I must be mad . Jack 's not stupid . He 's gonna catch us . You never know . We might get lucky . Everything 's gone . The computers , mobile coverage , lifts , everything . We 're sealed in . - How long does Gwen have before she dies ? - Two hours , maybe less . Come on , think ! If Suzie set up the lock down , how did she do it ? Entered an override ? No , she 's officially dead . The computer wouldn 't give her access . Then how did she do it ? What the hell did she do ? There 's got to be an answer . Suzie couldn 't physically start the lock down . Gwen wouldn 't have let her . - But there 's no one else . - Wait a minute . We 've got a guest . " ... stopped for me " The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality " Because I could not stop for Death He kindly stopped for me " What is that , a poem ? - I wonder . Emily Dickinson . - But what does it mean ? It 's a verbal trigger . Say it out loud , maybe repeat it 100 times over and the Hub locks down . But if that 's part of the system , Suzie must 've installed a vocal command program way back . Back when she was alive , yeah . Max is just a Trojan horse . Suzie planned this right from the start . Do you see ? Max , the Retcon , everything , it 's all been a hoax to get us to resurrect Suzie . She gave Max a whole complex of subconscious triggers . Like , she dies , Max becomes a time bomb . He doesn 't see her for three months and , wham , the orders kick in . He follows Suzie 's program and starts killing . And the whole chain of events forces us to bring Suzie back . And then she escapes . You gotta admit , that is not bad . I 'm picking her for my team . If she could lock down the Hub , she must 've installed a way of reversing it , just in case . Yeah . Bit more color in your cheeks . It 's all thanks to you . That night , my last night on Earth , so I thought , before I shot myself , I shot Jack right through the head . I killed him , stone dead , and then he just stood up and lived . Am I right ? Did that happen ? - Gwen ? - Yes , it did . - So he can survive a bullet through the head ? - Yeah . - How ? - I don 't know . He won 't explain it properly . He said something happened to him a while back . He said ... He said he can 't die . Not ever . And he makes judgments about whether I 'm allowed to live . It 's all very easy for Captain Jack , isn 't it ? - Do you ever wonder ? - What ? Who is he ? All the time . I 've got reception , sir . How did you do that ? We 're sealed off . Just used the water tower as a relay . Nice work , Ianto . But who the hell do we phone ? Detective Swanson . - Who is it ? - Torchwood . Better not be wasting my time . As a matter of fact , I was wondering if you could do us a favour . What , the humble police helping the mighty Torchwood ? Why don 't you just help yourselves like you normally do ? Because we can 't . Why 's that ? We 're sort of busy . Well , I 'm busy , too . Try someone else . No , no , no , it 's just because we can 't , at the moment , because we 're sort of stuck . - In what way ? - We 're locked in . - You 're locked in ? - Just a bit . - Locked in where ? - In our own base . - You 're locked inside your own base ? - And it 's not funny . And how am I supposed to help you , exactly ? We need a book of poetry . It 's not funny . Oh , God , driving at night . Oh , my God . I don 't know this one . Oh , it 's ancient . My mum used to sing this . When I was a kid . All those years ago . Before I died . All right , Captain Jack , just say that one more time . Nice and clear . We 're locked in our base and we can 't get out . Okay , you 've had your fun . Now , listen , Detective Swanson , one of our team is in danger . All right , you lot , back to work . Okay , I 've got it . The Complete Poems . It 's gonna cost you 20 quid . - What does the book say ? - I don 't know . What am I supposed to do ? Find " I could not stop for Death " . - Read out the next verse . - What if it doesn 't work ? - Read out the whole book . - It 's gonna be a long night . Thanks . Tired ? I 'm fine . I don 't want you falling asleep at the wheel . - One corpse is enough for this car , thanks . - Don 't say that . - What ? - Corpse . - ' Cause you 're not . - But what am I , then ? I don 't know . You 're just not , though . When you 're dead ... I mean , when you die , what happens ? - What do you want me to say ? - The truth . - Really ? - Tell me . - You religious , or ... - Just sort of in passing , you know . - Do you believe in heaven ? - I don 't know . Yes , you do . What do you believe ? It 's stupid , but I always sort of think , like , you know , white light and all that . And I think of my gran . Like she 'll be there , waiting for me . The smell of carbolic . Your faith never left primary school . - So what 's out there ? - Nothing . Just nothing . But ... But if there 's nothing , what 's the point of it all ? This is . Driving through the dark . All this stupid , tiny stuff . We 're just animals howling in the night ' cause it 's better than silence . I used to think about Torchwood , all those aliens coming to Earth . What the hell for ? But it 's just instinct . They come here ' cause there 's life , that 's all . Moths around a flame . Creatures clinging together in the cold . - So when you die , it 's just ... - Darkness . And you 're all alone ? There 's no one else ? - I didn 't say that . - What do you mean ? Why do you think I 'm so desperate to come back ? There 's something out there ... in the dark and it 's moving . " Parting is all we know of heaven And all we need of hell " No , try another . " Success is counted sweetest By those who ne 'er succeed " Christ , she was a bundle of laughs . " Success is counted sweetest By those who ne 'er succeed " - No . - Wait a minute , just had a thought . If words cause the lock down , maybe numbers reverse it . Try the ISBN . Every book 's got a different number . - You getting this ? - Yeah . Hang on , I 'm looking . - Read it out . - The keyboards aren 't working . But the membrane underneath might just recognise the code . Okay , got it . - ISBN ... - 019 ... - 8600 ... - 585 . That 's it ! Everybody move , move , move ! - Kathy , thank you . - Pleasure . I 've got the tracker on Gwen 's car . It 's a hospital . Giving you the coordinates now . On the way . How long has she got ? It 's only a guess , but I 'd give Gwen about 40 minutes . Kathy , I want the road ahead clear . I 'm gonna break the speed limit big time . All units , give Torchwood priority . Repeat , give Torchwood priority . Suzie , I don 't ... I 'm not ... Oh , my God , this headache ! It 's ... What 's happening to me ? Sorry , Gwen . You 're getting shot in the head . Slowly . And believe me , it hurts . Almost better . Completely gone soon . No , no , no . Dad ? It 's me , Dad . Wake up . Dad , it 's Suzie . Hello , Dad . Goodbye . What are you doing ? That 's worth coming back for . Sending him into the dark . Just what the bastard deserves . They 're moving again . Can 't predict a specific destination , not yet . Keep feeding it through . We 're catching up . - Hello ? - Did you like the poem , Jack ? Suzie , don 't let her die . - The glove is killing Gwen and keeping you alive . - I know . Then stop . But I get to live . Why would I stop ? - For Gwen 's sake . - But she replaced me , and now I 'm doing the same to her . Isn 't that fair ? Suzie , we 've got a tracker on that car . We 're gonna catch up . I promise . And what happens then ? If she 's dead , then I 'm gonna kill you , Suzie Costello . I promise . I 'm gonna kill you for the last and final time . But would you , when there 's a part of her that 's now me ? Could you really do that if I 'm the only thing left of her ? Why are you doing this ? Because life is all , Jack . You should know . I 'd do anything to stay . Anything . Suzie , please , just stop . She 's a real find , this one . Gwen Cooper . She 's better than me . She 's so much better . I was never any good . Jack , I 'm sorry . Suzie ! Jack , she 's heading for the coastline on the B587 . It 's a place called Hedley Point . There 's some sort of ferry goes out to the islands . Get a move on . - Owen , how long we got ? - Minutes . It 's beautiful , Gwen . Can you see ? We 'll take the ferry , go out as far as we can . Keep on running , ' cause he won 't hurt us . We 'll keep on going , you and me . I 'm sorry . Have you gone ? Gwen ? Can you hear me ? Gwen ? Poor Gwen Cooper . Safe journey . - Let her go . - I can 't . - Let Gwen go . - I can 't ! Owen , how is she ? - Owen ! Report ! - I think we 're too late . - If I kill you , does she live ? - But you can 't , Jack . ' Cause look at me . I 'm the last thing left of Gwen Cooper . Can 't you see it ? - Just the smallest bit of her ? - Not one bit . - Owen , anything ? - Nothing . - But I broke the connection . - Nothing . - I killed you . - I can 't die . Never gonna die . How much more of this do you want ? It 's all your fault , Jack . You recruited me . The glove . Tosh , destroy the glove . It 's keeping them connected . Ianto , Armaments , Code 5 . " Captain ! My captain ! " Do you want to know a secret ? There 's something moving in the dark and it 's coming , Jack Harkness . It 's coming for you . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Relax . - Thanks for doing this . - Part of my job , sir . No , I should be doing it , but ... One day we 're gonna run out of space . If you 're interested , I 've still got that stopwatch . So ? Well , think about it . Lots of things you can do with a stopwatch . Oh , yeah . I can think of a few . - There 's quite a list . - I 'll send the others home early . See you in my office in 10 . That 's 10 minutes and counting . Oh , Jack ? What do you want me to say on the death certificate ? - Good question . - She had quite a few deaths , in the end . I don 't know . Death by Torchwood . I 'll put a lock on the door , just in case she goes walking again . Nah , no chance of that . The resurrection days are over , thank God . Oh , I wouldn 't be too sure . That 's the thing about gloves , sir . They come in pairs . Excuse me . Am I dead ? Something 's happened . We need to talk to you . Did he walk into " oncoming traffic " ? I am in heaven . Are you sure it 's my Eugene ? Listen to this . Eugene had an alien eye in his collection . - He sold it online . - A Dogon Sixth Eye ? Maybe . I just feel that there 's something going on . I don 't want this to end . I love you .

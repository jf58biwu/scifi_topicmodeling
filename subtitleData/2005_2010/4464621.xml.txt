 I saw someone drowning me . How do I atone for something I haven 't done yet ? The man you might be sleeping with in six months ' time was just in our living room , and I sure as hell didn 't bring him into our lives . You did ! All the old patterns are back , Mark . It 's about trust , and we don 't trust each other anymore . I had a vision of Fiona Banks . - Let 's see if she had a vision of me . - Al , I know why you 're calling . It 's something to do with the Rutherford case . Listen , Al , you 've been acting kind of weird for a couple of weeks yourself . Blue Hand--it 's a clue from Mark 's board . Dear Celia , I don 't know your last name , and I don 't know where you live , but I know you have two young boys- - Twins , I believe . And I know you didn 't have a flash-forward . I understand how terrifying that is and how powerless you must be feeling . But I want you to know that you are not alone . E-mailing your other girlfriends ? No , we , uh , we broke up . This is just porn . - Oh , okay . - Yeah . I 'm in pre-trial conference all day , so totally unreachable , but don 't forget we need to sign off on the proofs later . - Proofs ? - For the wedding invitations . Right . Bet you 20 bucks they spell my name wrong . Bet you $ 100 they got mine wrong . You know , they say couples with commonly misspelled names are the most successful . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . Meet me at the printers at 6 : 00 , okay ? Can 't you just pick one ? I 'm gonna pretend I didn 't hear that . I 'm just saying you have great taste . I mean , I don 't need to be there , right ? Hey , kick ass today . I might be home a little late tonight . I 'm covering the E.R. for Sally again . I tried to get out of it , but- - You don 't have to explain . It 's just hard 'cause Crosby 's out of town , - so there really is no one else . - Olivia , you don 't have to explain . I trust you . Good . I trust you , too . It 's like everything I say comes out wrong- - Everything . Even when we 're getting along , it 's tense . Things have changed for everybody . It 's a new world . Yeah ? I miss the old one then . Really ? The one where you used to crash on my couch playing " Madden " till 4 : 00 A.M. ? Don 't you mean futon , and don 't you mean kicking your ass - until 4 : 00 A.M. ? - What ? - What ? I said it . - No , you didn 't kick anything . You were- - you were cheating . That 's what you were doing . Hey , man , what you call cheating I call finding a way to change the game , my friend . Oh . How 's Agent Hawk doing ? She 's out of the woods . Should be back to work in a few weeks . You think these three had something to do with her shooting ? Well , we followed the hand stamp from the guy who shot Janis , led us to the house where we found these guys . The Blue Hand stamp ? Mm-hmm . I 'm sensing a theme . Yeah ? You want to share ? The contact ring , residue patterns and bullet trajectories are consistent with self-inflicted gunshot wounds . Self-inflicted ? Was it--you think this is some kind of suicide pact ? Had to be . But then who arranged the bodies and covered them with the sheets that night ? All had alcohol in their systems . She had ecstasy and heroin . Hey , Dem , who- - who are these people ? Um , Jason Martinez , 37 . Married , two children . This is Diana Davis . Still looking for next of kin , and- - And Ian Rutherford , 25 . British national . Reported missing from a cargo vessel docked in Long Beach . Your Rutherford case ? Yeah . Here we go . FlashForward - Season 1 Episode 07 ( " The Gift " ) Hang up . - Hey , Aaron . - What 's up , Jack ? There 's a guy waiting for you inside Says he served with Tracy . How can I help you ? You 're Aaron Stark ? Corporal Mike Willingham . I 've been meaning to come talk to you for a while , but I 've been mixed up- - trying to get a job , trying to get a place to live . It 's tough re-adjusting to civilian life . Especially with the way things are now . You just gotta hope it gets better . Yeah . Sorry to bother you at your place of work , but I promised Tracy that if anything ever happened to her , I 'd give you this . How did you find me ? I 'll always find you , kiddo . I think right now you need this more than I do . I hadn 't seen this knife since Tracy deployed four years ago , but somehow ... Now I understand how in my flash-forward , I was giving it back to her . She said it was a good luck charm . Maybe there 's something to that . For two years , I 've had to listen to people telling me to move on , to accept what happened to her . But I always knew I 'd see her again . Now you showing up here and ... It 's all happening , isn 't it ? It 's all happening . Thank you , Mike . Thank you . Why do a copy machine salesman , a librarian and a Scottish journalist all decide to get together to shoot themselves ? Because print is dead ? Gough , say hello to your vision . You all know Fiona Banks , MI6 , fresh off the plane from London . Nice to meet you again ... for the first time . Yeah . Nice to meet you . Suicide seems a little low-incident for MI6 . Ian Rutherford was reported missing off a cargo ship two weeks ago . The British embassy was notified . I saw the report and came here because- - 'Cause you knew you 'd be working on this case from your flash-forward . That 's all well and good , but what do we got in the present ? Well , when I found out all three VICs committed suicide , I cross-referenced their visions on Mosaic . Turns out they 're all ghosts . So people who didn 't see anything in their flash-forwards- - That 's what they call themselves . So none of them had visions , and now they 're all dead . Am I the only one who finds that disturbing ? No , you 're not . Here . Check this out . It 's a ghost web site . It 's where they connect with each other , find out about upcoming events . Anchorage , Buenos Aires , Dubai ... Whatever this is , it 's happening everywhere . " The Blue Hand . No limits . No fear . A place where ghosts can gather to embrace the inevitable . " You 've got to be kidding me . A death club ? Like a book club with bullets . Whatever it is , the guy who shot Janis is a part of it . We need to find these people , figure out who they are and shut them down . The next meeting in Los Angeles is being hosted by a guy named Raynaud- - Dr. Maurice Raynaud . When 's the meeting ? Tonight , go downtown and check the time . Tonight , go downtown and check the time . Tonight , go downtown and check the time . Ian Blaine Rutherford . Born in Edinburgh , 1984 . Father 's an aviation mechanic . Mother ... Works in a factory , makes cell phone components . I 've already seen that file . Yes , of course . Sorry . I just , uh , I never expected to be working on this case so soon . The dominos seem to be falling into place , don 't they ? It 's funny . I don 't remember anything from the actual dossier other than his name . I just remember you ... and the bird . When it hit the window ... I literally felt my heart skip a beat . Then you had the phone call . Excuse me for a moment . After you left , I looked out onto the ledge . I went over . I wanted to help it , if only to end its pain . But I couldn 't . That was the worst part . There was nothing I could do to stop it . What was your phone call about ? It was my attorney . Why were you speaking to an attorney ? Did something happen ? I killed her . No , everything was fine . Hey , babe . Hey , I 'm working downtown tonight . Thought I might stop by that bakery on Grand on the way back , pick us up some of those cinnamon rolls . Or not . You don 't have any idea why I 'm mad , do you ? No . The printers ? Our invitations ? Oh , my God . I 'm so sorry . Work was so crazy . All right ? We got a lead on the guy who shot Janis , and now we 're going to this underground club- - Yeah , you 're not the only one who had a crazy day . I 've been cranking out motions in limine all afternoon but somehow made it to the printers anyway . You 're right . I suck . I should have been there . I 'm really sorry . It 's not about the invitations , Dem . It 's about you and me and the fact that you 've been checked out ever since I got home from Seattle . You know I 've been slammed since the blackout . - Babe , please . - Yes , since the blackout , yeah . That 's been your excuse for everything . Yeah , no , why you are late coming home , why you don 't feel like talking , why you shut your computer every time I walk in the room . It 's ... It 's like I don 't even exist . Hey , that 's unfair . What 's unfair is being in love with someone who treats you like a stranger . That 's unfair . You know , and I don 't want you to apologize . I don 't . I want you to want to be here . Talk to me . Just--just be honest about whatever 's going on . - You want me to be honest . - Yes . The more you jump down my throat , the less I want to be here . How 's that for honesty ? Demetri ! Dem ! - Is he qualified ? - No , I think- - Thanks so much for having me . Oh , not at all . We always need volunteers . I gotta tell you , there 's a lot of menial tasks- - A lot of charts to be filed and blood to be run to the lab . - It 's not exactly glamorous . - I 'm not looking for glamour . Dr. Benford ? Hey , aren 't you supposed to be at that intern conference ? Yeah , but lab 's lost the coags on our spider girl , the O.R. is trying to bump our appy another hour , and volvulus guy is leaving the A.M.A. to see his kid in this " ice capades " thing . Okay , so redraw the coags , tell the O.R. no , - and I 'll talk to skater dad . - Okay . - Bryce , do you know Nicole ? - Uh , yeah . Yeah , I think we met at your christmas party last year . Hi . Hey . Nicole 's volunteering here . You know what- - Shadow Bryce . He 'll show you the lay of the land . I will catch you later . - Thanks . - What 's " volvulus " ? Twisted gut . You pre-med ? No , I-I 'm just volunteering , helping people , you know . Uh ... Um , ma 'am ... Okay , slow down . I 'm sorry . We don 't understand you . Thank you . Arigato . Sweet peas symbolize good-bye in japanese culture . It 's considered a bad omen to give it to the sick . Ah . Is that a cardigan ? What ? I was going for Average Joe . - Back off , Dem . - That jacket ? Ridiculous . Says the FBI agent in a police T-shirt . Good going . What ? " Go downtown , check the time . " We 're ... here for the meeting . At , uh , Dr. Raynaud 's invitation . Who 's gonna play ? Play ? Who is going to play ? I get it . No bullets . Good gag . Your ticket ... in . Welcome to the Blue Hand , gentlemen . You got a death wish ? You could have been killed . Not today . That was a real bullet in that gun . - You know that , right ? - Listen , Demetri , unlike the rest of these people , I know I 'm gonna be alive in six months . I 've seen it . So bullet or no bullet , there 's no way I was gonna die tonight . - Hey . - What can I get you ? Could you get us to talk to Raynaud ? Is he here ? Hmm . You guys first-timers ? No . Maybe . The Raynaud changes at each gathering . And where is tonight 's Raynaud ? He 's around . You 'll know him when you see him . What you got ? It was on my board . Another piece of the puzzle . So what do we ... do here ? Anything you want . No limits . No fear . There 's something for everybody . Hi . Hey . Look , I-I really need - to talk to you about- - - I don 't think we should really be doing the- - any of the ... Uh , me first ? Um , okay . Okay . Fine . Um , I really just came by to say thank you for everything you 've done for Dylan . He did all the hard work himself . Well , you saved his life ... And in doing that , um , you saved mine as well . Look , the very last thing that I would want to do is ruin yours . I really mean it . - I really don 't think we should be- - - Hey , listen , I understand . I understand that this is really very awkward . So please just let me be perfectly clear . Nothing is going to happen between us . - No , I know that . - I would never do anything to come between you and your husband , despite what we may have seen or experienced . Good . Okay , good . So , uh , Dylan and I are gonna move back to the bay area as soon as they approve the hospital transfer . Good . Oh , good . That 's ... that 's good . You must be anxious to , um , you know , get back to work . - Yeah , right . Um- - - And I should go . So ... Listen , um , thank you so much for everything again . Yeah , I 'll do everything I can to push that transfer through . - Okay , great . Thanks . - Um , just excuse me . Thank you . Hey , where did you learn how to speak Japanese ? My dad was stationed in Okinawa when I was little , and I picked it up . When we moved back , I took it in school . Can I show you something ? Just for a second . Uh , in my flash-forward , I saw this symbol behind her . Who 's the woman ? I have no idea . I was hoping that if I could figure out what the symbol meant , then I might be able to find her . I know it 's an Asian character , but nobody seems to recognize it . They didn 't see it because it wasn 't finished . You have a pen ? Yeah , a pencil . - May I ? - Please . There . It 's kanji . It 's a Japanese letter . Kanji . What 's it mean ? " Believe . " Mr. Stark ? Mike . What are you doing here ? Sorry to bother you again . I just didn 't feel right leaving things the way we did earlier . I 'm not sure I understand . It 's just ... You seemed so happy , and I didn 't know how to tell you , but I think you deserve to know the truth . Truth about what ? About what you saw in your vision with Tracy . It 's not possible . What are you talking about ? I was with her in the humvee . Blind Father , this is Hit Man 2 requesting backup . Put Oscar Mike , pursuing Hajis heading north , about two clicks away from checkpoint Victor Tango . Over . Damn ! Who the hell are these guys ? - Those aren 't Hajis . - Back up ! Back up ! Those are Jericho ! We got to get out ! Move ! Burro , burro ! We 're gonna get waxed ! - Get out ! - Look out ! Come on ! Tracy ! I 'm sorry , sir . When I went back to check on her ... Tracy ! Tracy ! I had to run . I had to . But I saw her die . I saw her die . This is pathetic . What have they got to lose , man ? Doesn 't matter if it 's tonight or next month . They 're dead anyway . Blue hands . They represent a portal , a gateway from one understanding to another . The blue hand marks a surrender to the inevitable . Raynaud . Here we go . - You got me ? - Yeah . FBI ! - Everybody get down ! - Get down ! - Everybody down ! - Everybody ! FBI ! Get down ! Everybody down ! - Get my gun ! - Now ! Now ! - Aah . I want to- - - Turn around . Turn around ! I want this to end . Not today . Not today . " Dr. Maurice Raynaud- - " Discovered Raynaud 's phenomenon , " also known as ' blue hands . ' Died 1881 . " Guess it does beat your real name- - Jeff Slingerland . Am I saying that right ? Says here you taught American history at South Fairfax High . Teacher of the Year ' 08 . Then the blackout happens , and you turn into Friedrich Nietzsche . Why is that , Jeff ? Or do you prefer Dr. Raynaud ? You know what Nietzsche said- - " If you gaze into the abyss , the abyss also gazes into you . " Is that the kind of optimism that comes from not having a vision ? I had a vision- - A bottomless pit of darkness and indifference , infinite in its nothingness , as if I never existed at all and I never would again . These people who didn 't have a vision--these ghosts- - Where do you Raynauds find them ? We don 't find them . You do . There 's no better place to go than your Mosaic site . Couldn 't do it without you . Do you see this guy ? One of your fellow blue hands , shot and nearly killed an FBI agent . You better start talking , or I 'm gonna charge you as an accomplice after the fact . Fine . Throw me in prison . I don 't care . It 's all mapped out . Don 't you understand ? The script for this conversation has already been written . Whatever you 've all seen is gonna happen . What if you 're wrong ? What if April 29th comes and goes , and you 're still alive ? What then ? You can run and you can hide , but you can 't escape what 's coming . No one can . Heading out ? Yes , back to my luxury suite . They still putting visiting agents up at those crappy hotels by the airport ? Now you 're just rubbing it in . You ever try dirty rice ? Dirty rice ? What , you mean , like , eating it off the floor ? No , no , it 's , uh , it 's a cajun dish . It 's my favorite . My mom makes it for me when I go home at the holidays . I thought I might try and make a batch of it tonight . If you 're feeling hungry at all ... That 's , uh , sweet of you . That really is , - but I 'm jet-lagged . - I understand . I 'd be tired , too . You know , I 've been thinking about our bird . - What if you taped the window ? - How do you mean ? Well , if you cover the window , the bird might not crash into it . It 's a nice thought . I think it 'll probably just crash into a different window . Maybe . But it 's worth a shot . Hmm . Can 't accuse him of sugarcoating things . That guy makes Marilyn Manson look like Mr. Rogers . Everybody deals with it differently , I guess . I 'm sorry , I ... It 's all right . At least I don 't have to deal with the uncertainty . It is the one good thing about knowing the exact date of your murder . Gives you time to prepare . So what 's gonna happen ? March 15th comes around , you 're just gonna pack it in ? - Come on , man . - Huh ? Say your good-byes , have a nice farewell dinner ? I 'll deal with it the way I choose to deal with it . You deal with it by fighting it . That 's what we 're doing here . Wake up , would you , please ? Wake up ! D. Gibbons . The--the doll factory . 137 sekunden . The Blue Hand . It 's all come true . No , no . - Listen , it doesn 't mean that you 're- - - Mark , look around you . Look around , man . Raynaud was right . It 's all happening , every single day . There 's no way out . There 's nothing you or I or anyone can do to escape what 's coming . Give me 20 bucks for it . This is magic beyond all comprehension . It searches with power and imaginary . It seems that cosmic energies not meant for the mortal men . They stay crumbled and resent the shattering omnipotence . Okay , I 'm tired , you 're tired . It 's time for bed . Oh , Mommy ! Please ? That 's all right . I got it . Okay , five minutes . - Okay . - Five . Okay . - I love you . - I love you , too . Sleep well . Good night . Okay . Daddy , are you sad ? No . No , baby . Daddy 's happy . Got you something . Um ... I 'm not really hungry , but thanks . I really do love you . You know that , right ? I know I 've , uh ... I 've been distant lately , but I ... Didn 't know how to tell you , uh ... And what to tell you . I didn 't know what to do . About ? About my flash-forward . I told you I saw myself on the beach at our wedding . That was a lie . I didn 't see anything , only darkness . Nothingness . I didn 't have a flash-forward because I 'm gonna be dead . Tonight , I met all these people just like me . No visions . No hope . They were just ... waiting to die . I don 't wanna be like that . I don 't wanna be like that . I wanna be here with you . - Dem ? - Yes ? I know what I saw ... The beach . Our wedding . I know you were there . You gotta know how much I wanted that . I wanted to marry you , have a baby with you , - grow old with you . - It was a mistake . You just made a mistake . There 's no way of knowing for sure , so- - Zoey , I 'm sure . I 'm sure . Listen to me . I love you . I love you . You are the life that I wanted . Then let 's have that life . - Zoe- - - We can have that life . You said you didn 't want to give up hope . Then don 't . We have two conflicting visions . We can choose which one we wanna believe in . I choose hope . You 're right . Thanks for coming out , Mike . Is everything all right , sir ? Everything 's fine . That 's why I called you out , actually . I thought you might be upset with me , sir , for ... telling you what I told you . I 've spent the last few weeks tortured by what I saw , up and down , living in limbo . But your story , what you told me ... You 've finally given me some peace . And I was hoping maybe I could return the favor . Wow . You won 't be the first screwed up vet this place has hired . Aaron , thank you . No , thank you . You 're a real artist . You could totally sell these . Thanks . Yeah , I 'd give ' em away for nothing if somebody could help me find her . Thanks . So you don 't remember her name or where she lives ? Uh , just , I remember the images ... But I-I just can 't put them together . But you remember how you felt about her ? Oh , yeah . - You have to find her , Bryce . - How ? She could be anywhere . Well , look at your paintings . Look at her . It 's Japan . It has to be . Do you have any idea how many people live in Japan ? You could put your story up on Mosaic . Even if she doesn 't see it , someone she knows might . It 's worth a shot . Morning , guys . - Morning . - Hey . - You coming to the meeting ? - You two go ahead . Hey , Demetri ? Yeah . I left something on your desk . Can you make sure it gets into the right hands ? Yeah . See you later . We 've got this Raynaud guy in custody . Now what ? He 's still refusing to name names , give us an idea of who 's in charge . My sense is this people aren 't killers- - Just lost , aggressive nihilists . Your sense ? You 've gotta do better than that , Mark . You can break any perp . You 've just gotta change your approach . No , Raynaud 's different . Can 't threaten him with anything . He 's got nothing to lose . He has seen his future , and it is bleak . He doesn 't even know how it 's gonna happen . It could be a fall , a fight , a shooting , a car accident . The possibilities are infinite . The guy 's walking on eggshells every minute of the day , just waiting for the hammer to drop . Hello ? Al , I- - I just got off the phone with hospital . They took her off life support an hour ago . I 'm sorry , Al . She 's gone . Every day , he wakes up wondering if today is the day- - If today is the day his future 's finally gonna catch up with him . What 's gonna happen to her children ? It looks like the kids will have to be placed in foster care . Those two boys are orphans ... Because of me ? No , Celia 's death was an accident , okay ? It could 've happened to anyone . But it didn 't . It was my fault . I killed her . The change in- - Stop . Stop ! Al ! Al ! Al ! - No , no , no . - Al ! Talk to us , Al ! Just-just talk to us . We can fix this . Hey , man , we can find her . We can find Celia . We can protect her . Anything you need , we can find a way to make it happen , son . Come on , Al . It can happen anytime , anywhere . I don 't even know how it happens . Al , listen to me . You 're alive six months from now . You saw it . You saw it ! Man , you saw it ! - But if I 'm not here ... - Come on , Al , get down . If I 'm not here ... It means we can change things . Al , please get down . What I saw ... I killed her . What you saw ... doesn 't have to play out that way . Al , what are you talking about ? I found a way to change the game . Al , listen to me . Celia 's death was an accident , okay ? A terrible , random accident . There 's nothing you could 've done to avoid this . Nothing . - Al ! - Al ! Al ! - Al ! - No , no , no . " Dear Celia , " I don 't know your last name , " and I don 't know where you live , " but I know you have two young boys- - " Twins , I believe . " And I know you didn 't have a flash-forward . " I understand how terrifying that is and how powerless you must be feeling . " " But I want you to know " that you are not alone " and that your situation is not as hopeless as you think . " " Our paths were meant to cross , " I didn 't know how . I didn 't know when . " " But things have changed now . Things are no longer going to unfold as I had feared . " " My gift to you is release from that dread ... " " From the feeling that you 're no longer in control . " " We will never meet . " I will never know you . " So live your life . Live every day . " " And know that the future is unwritten . " " Make the most of that . " Hi , Dad .

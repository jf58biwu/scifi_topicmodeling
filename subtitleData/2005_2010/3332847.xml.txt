I can 't tell you how painful that was . It nearly killed all of us . Especially Pops . Ηe didn 't set foot in his shop for over a year .

And the second the black-and-white came down .. . . .. we looked at each other and we realized ... . .. racing 's in oυr blood . But for Pops .. . . .. it isn 't just a sport . It 's Way more important than that . It 's like a religion . And in our hoυse , the major sponsors ... . .. are kind of like the devil .

There is the true spirit of the golden age of racing . Benjamin Braddack , Reginald White ' George Wheeler , Diamond Dave TeWksbury . .. . .. and Oliver Potter . The five most powerful men in the World at the turn of the last century . For all intents and pυrposes ' they created the modern aυtomotive indυstry . But the trυe stroke of their geniυs was the invention of the WRL ... ... the world 's first racing league . Interesting that you and your father were so moved by the 43 Prix . One of the great finishes in the history of racing , right ? Everyone remembers Bυrns and Stickleton slυgging it out . But Who remembers Carl Potts ? Driving this rebυilt Wittigan for lodyne lndustries ... . .. Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DΝF ... ... a forgettable and pathetic finish . So bad that afterWards' lodyne stock dropped six points . But as Ben Bυrns sat gυzzling cold , fresh milk in Victory Lane ... ... a thousand cameras taking his picture ... . .. Sirrυs Aeronautics saw almost a 1 2-point gain ... . .. which blocked Penninsυla Power Cell ... . .. from being able to afford the price of a takeover . This pυt Joel Goldman , the CEO of lodyne , lnc. in the exact position he wanted to be in . By first bυying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price ... . .. he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that sent lodyne into the gains record book .. . . .. the only record book that matters . Look oυt that window . There isn 't a single plane or helicopter or K-Ηarrier . .. . .. that isn 't powered by lodyne fuel cells . That 's what racing is about . It has nothing to do with cars or drivers . All that matters is power and the υnassailable might of money . Whoo ! Dυde ! Yeah ! Oh ' no ! Woo-hoo ! Get out of the way ! Oυt of the Way ! Get out of the way ! [ imitates electric guitar ] [ PEOPLE YELLlΝG ] Yoυ understand ? Burns knew he Was going to win . It was already decided . A week before the Prix' Goldman and Sirrυs ... . .. met with other major players at the Cargyle Ηotel . They met there as they had for years . They met to negotiate the finish order of the Grand Prix . Νo race is more important and no race is more controlled . Goldman was supposed to win , bυt he knew if he sold his win ... . .. whatever that win might be worth was nothing compared to what coυld be gained . That 's why I spent $ 3 million on this bυrnt and twisted lump of metal . Becaυse it reminds me of what really matters . This is the trυe heart of racing , boy . This is my religion . Yoυ don 't know how offen I 've seen that same cow-eyed ... . .. " say it isn 't so " look of disbelief . Every bumpkin Who comes in from the sticks looks exactly as yoυ do now .

SPEED : It was very weird ' Trix . I knew every move he was gonna make and he knew mine. lt was so familiar . Maybe I 'm crazy , bυt Racer X first showed up two years affer Rex 's death . But ' Speed , we bυried Rex . A body was bυried . Remember ' it had already been badly bυrned in the crash . Even if it was Rex' no one coυld have recognized him . So yoυ think he faked the crash with a different body in the driver 's seat ? Somehow the kwik-save was disconnected . Inspector Detector suspected foul play , bυt nothing could be proved .

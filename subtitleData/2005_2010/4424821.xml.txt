Ooo , sounds terribly ominous . Why am i here ? it has nothing to do with me - any of this . I 've seen you before . Really ? What were you doing in the mountains , six ? I was-i was , uh , lost . I mean , i have no idea how i got here . I - what did you call me ? This - look , something 's wrong here . Yes ! You are wrong , six . Do not call me that - i am not six . Show me your id papers . Well , i don 't have any papers ... Well , you just put them there . You were seen in the mountains . what have you done with 93 ? I don 't know anything about 93 . Where is the old man ? You can 't do this to me ! I don 't care who you are - do you hear me ! Now , i wanna get back to new york . Well , that 's not possible - There is no new york - there 's only the village . look , we 've been here before . it all feels too familiar - i know that . truly , we live for today . This is my home ? we must be doing something right . No , i mean ... you can 't escape it . My apartment in - done in your other life . This is where you belong . we interrupt this programming for the following public - will you just , uh , sign this to say that everything 's in order ? I 'm signin ' nothin ' , pal . the palais today identified the missing villager as 93 , a man in his late 70 's , last seen heading north into the desert two nights ago . 93 is well known to hospital staff following a history of stage seven mental unwellness . he also suffers from shortness of breath , dizzy spells and a weak heart . but we wish him well and hope to report his discovery eminently ... if not sooner . Hey ! What can i do you for ? I 'd like to buy a map . Hmm ... street or topographic ? Biggest one you got . That 's the biggest ? Pull her out . That 's it ! Buy one , get one free . What the hell would i want with two maps ? Makes a perfect gift . Big enough for ya ? Here we are ... You are here . That 's the palais two . " wow " being the appropriate word . and that 's the clinic and - Where 's the road outta here ? ohh - you crack me up , six . You 've not seen me before . no , sir . you , i would remember . But you know my - welcome to the village . Everybody knows everybody ! Be seein ' ya ! six ! Six , wait ! Why are you calling me that ? well , i think that it suits you . Six ... hmm , i like it . Six , where do you think you 're going ? Goin ' home . You won 't get far . Is there nothing can say that will make you wait ? you can tell me the truth . What the hell is this place ? You 're one of us . That 's the truth . Wha - hey ! Aw , man , not my car - come on ! Do you think i could use your phone ? Mine 's just been stolen . Yeah . Go ahead . Actually , i lied . I lost it . I 'm always losing my phone . i hate leaving messages - don 't you ? i noticed you , ' cause you look like you 're waiting for someone . Maybe , i am . Who you waitin ' for ? Don 't answer that . i 'm late ... again . ... traffic the same on the g.w. as the jersey turnpike . it 's hell on four wheels out there . so , if you want my advice - get off your butt and walk ! total gridlock from some kind of gas explosion in the heart of brooklyn . Hey ! you got my phone . Oh ! Um , i 'd say , " sorry " but i promised myself I 'd stop apologizing to men . Having a party ? Yeah , you wanna come ? Can 't make it tonight . There 's no party , anyway . Ah , just what i thought ... " drinking alone . " I 'm celebrating . Oh , yeah - what ? You were talking to someone . You shouldn 't listen to other people 's conversations . It 's rude . How come you 're interested in my life back there , If it doesn 't exist ? Of course , i 'm interested . I want to help you with these delusions . I can 't leave here , can i ? Why would you want to leave ? why would you even think such a thing ? All right , doctor . My delusion is , i met a woman the other night ... And i invited her back to my apartment . Did she come back ... To your apartment ? I don 't know . I don 't know . what 's that ? I haven 't opened it , yet . It 's from the clinic . What 's it say ? We 've been summoned , to the clinic . What for ? An appointment , with two . Oh , dear ! It says someone else here at the bottom . So , this guy at the hospital . he wants to know where 93 's body is . Why ? That 's not a delusion . That 's happening here , right now . If you did see 93 . Is that why they set me free , to let you loose on me ? the caring , sharing doctor , With the big beautiful eyes and the nice , girly smile . Soften me up - get me to talk ? Of course , you doubt me . You doubt everything , But that 's not you speaking , six . That 's your condition . my condition is that i 'm being held here Against my will . cabins 29 to 63 . yellow district - cabins 309 to 357 . green district - apartments 51 to 299 . Can you see , six , How i might wonder why you are here , If , as you claim , " you know nothing about 93 ? " I came here to find out who this man , 93 , is . Now that you 're here ... Do you see what he was ? A drunk . A fool . Maybe he drank , Because he found the lie of this place unbearable . he knew what i know . The village is not all that there is . What is it you 're suggesting ? A hole in the sky , Aliens landing secretly in the night , Mysterious roads that lead beyond , beyond , beyond . A magic gateway , perhaps ? Some portal leading into " never-never land . " Take a look outside , six . People going about their lives , Strolling in the sun , sitting together in the park , Or anywhere where they might choose to sit together . They take a scooter ride , go dancing , Enjoy a beer in the cafe , While they gaze about the village . Contented . hopeful . every day above ground is a good day . The problem ... is in your mind . Well ... i want out . You 've tried that ! There is no " out . " There is only " in . " Now , you can go on tormenting yourself , If that 's what you want , Or you can stop . If 93 were no more than a drunk , A fool , as you say , Then why were they chasing after him ? Shooting at him ? Because 93 found something , And if he can do it , i can . I pity you , six . You refuse to open your mind to the possibility That you 're wrong . If i open my mind , You 'll take it away from me . We might ... But we will always give it back . Did 93 show you this - i need to know . Did he talk to you about this ? Are there other drawings ? 554 , please . 93 must 've trusted you . There has to be a reason he told me to come to you . What is this - what does this do ? I 'm going to meet my boyfriend . I 'm sorry . please , help me . please . 93 said , " the drawings were from his other life ... " before the village . " That 's all i know . You have to leave me alone , now . And you are here to receive a medal For services to the village , And you should keep the medal with you , At all times . And when you met number six , What did you make of him ? He was a little strange . A - a-actually - nope . Number six has been dealt with , So he is no longer a worry to us . And there was another thing , in the summons . Uh , yeah , it said , uh , " to bring cake , with cherries in it . " Did you ? Uh , yeah - yeah . Oh , no - leave it there . " my dear villagers , perhaps two could interrupt your day in the sun to relate the grave news that we have discovered number 93 's body in the mountains . sadly , the old man had succumbed to a weak heart . he spoke briefly to emergency staff , before dying on route to the hospital . his last words were to honor the village , and request the anthem be sung in his name . If you tell me what you know , I promise you , i won 't come back . breathe in , breath out ... village life goes on . Do you want , uh , something to drink ? 93 was convinced that his dreams meant That he had another life , before this one . he started saying things - " that we 're prisoners here . " Prisoners ? I 've said too much . I - i don 't even know who you are . It 's okay - you can trust me . i am not one of them . I dream this , all the time . What is it ? This is more real , than anything out there . This is the first bit of hope i 've been given , Since i got here . If there are others like us , who dream , and they got to thinking that 93 escaped , then - do you think there are others ? Do you ? Are you for real ? I promise you - you 're safe with me . i 'll see you at the cafe tomorrow . What is it , 11-12 ? Why is six so convinced there is another place ? Because for people like six , life is not enough . The simple life ... They want to escape it . What are you doing here ? Oh , i 'm trying to find out what you 're doin ' here . Do something for me , will ya ? Lie down beside me . you 're supposed to be trying To convince me you 're sane . Come on . Uh , okay . Right . A hundred billion stars , Over and over billions of galaxies , and that 's just what we can see . Can you honestly tell me That the village is all that there is ? Of course not . Has to be life out there somewhere . Perhaps , another village . Oh , it 's , um , 400 billion , By the way . Look at me . Isaac newton , galileo , Plato , socrates , Karl marx , groucho marx , Darwin - surely , darwin . kennedy , bob dylan , david beckam . Who invented the telephone ? Oh , uh , uh ... Alexander graham bell - the light bulb ? 512 . Everyone says it was thomas edison . It was joseph swan . where do these names come from - these memories ? I was taught this stuff by a lady named mrs. radcliff , My teacher . Now , where does that come from ? now , tell me about mrs. radcliff . you 're humoring me. tell me , anyway . Okay , she had a big blue nose , Skin like a crocodile . She actually looked more like a man in a dress . Not just a man , but a boxer . Wow ! I like her , already . Do you know what a crocodile is ? Are you trying to trap me ? Yes - no . Yes . Yes ... yes. are you trying to trap me ? no . Tell me about the woman . I resigned today . Oh , that 's why you 're celebrating . Alone . Too bad . Um , i go this way . Oh ! Really ? Really . Uh , what 's your name ? Lucy . Lucy . Well , i 'd like to get to know you , lucy . Well , maybe you can . Well , i 'd like to get to know you , tonight . Well , maybe you can . maybe , you can . * take your burden to the lord and leave it there * * if you trust and never doubt * * it will surely bring you out * * take your burden to the lord and leave it there * What 's goin ' on ? You know what it is , six . 93 deserves a decent burial . You didn 't find his body . 93 is gone - escaped . Found the way out . If 93 found the way out , Six can convince himself that there is an out . Six must try to escape , because six knows , There is nothing to escape from . In his mind , in is soul , Six knows that six is six . Hey , man - need a cab ? Why would i need a cab , if i 'm going into a cafe ? Well , you know , people who go into cafes , Come outta cafes , And sometimes , they might need a cab . Well , i don 't know , if i 'll need a cab . Why you hassling me , anyway ? hey , six ... I like ya - you 're a likable man . And i like giving rides in my cab to people i like . Sometimes , being nice is , uh , Well , it 's just being nice . Hey . I 'll always be here , if you need me . Thanks . if you 're crawling through traffic , hoping to escape for the weekend , think hard , my friends . did you hear that ? it 's the same on the g.w. - it 's hell on four wheels out there . oh , gridlock , after some kind of gas explosion , in the heart of brooklyn . Put a pillow on his face . Snuffed him out like a - Snuffed him out like a candle . Now-now , he 's dead . Need some help here ! Hey . I 'm glad i met you , six . I 'm glad i told you . Perhaps , we can escape together . when you 're better . 93 said - he said ... " follow the towers . " please , back away , sir - please , back away . keep calm , now . What is it - terrorists ? Some kind of resistance ? Tell me - you should 've stayed away from her . So , what are you saying ? Are you saying , " this is my fault ? " Look - no , you tell me , damn it ! Don 't you see - what 's the matter with you ? With every pore of my body , i 'm scared . Look , um ... Sometimes , not very often , Something like this happens . And everything goes back to normal . Things , they settle down . They do it for us . Just , please , don 't make things worse , six . " i promise you , you 're safe with me . " two ! Do you hear me ? She 's gone - you did that . she knew there was a way outta here ! and i 'm gonna find it ! I will find a way to escape ! Do you hear me ? i am not a number ! i 'm a free man ! Human beings can be so cruel .

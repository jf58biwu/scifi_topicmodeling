 Delta ! On me ! - Go , go ! - Go ! Go , go , go ! We should take Charlie and clear these buildings on the left , okay ? Right , take two , roll from room to room . First assault team , clear room ! Let 's go ! On me ! [ Indistinct shout ] Team , let 's go ! On me ! [ Indistinct shout ] Clear room back ! Go ! Go ! On me ! [ Indistinct shout ] Clear room back ! Come on ! On me ! Quickly out through exit ! Building clear ! [ Male reporter ] Little is known of the true scale of the pandemic in Asia . Rioting and looting has been reported in some major cities , but governments have been playing down ... [ Female reporter ] The government originally stated that incidents in Asia were isolated cases and posed no significant threat . ... Kingdom 's preparation for pandemic has been severely criticized in the press , with official figures grossly underestimating the spread of ... [ Man ] What I want to know is what are the government doing right now , at this moment , to prevent an outbreak in this country . [ Man ] To my knowledge , there has still not been a single case reported in Great Britain , America , or Western Europe . These figures have been taken completely out of context . The threat to human life is minimal . [ Man ] Also , documents leaked to the Scientific Institute in London contradict official government figures . [ Woman ] World health officials have been closely monitoring the progress of the virus across Europe since the first case was reported in Romania two weeks ago . [ Man ] Scientists in Cambridge have today confirmed they 're still at least three months away from formulating a vaccine . [ Woman ] Closure of schools up and down the country as a preventative measure , intended to minimize the spread of the yet unidentified virus , should it reach heavily populated areas . Well , listening to what 's been said about it , it doesn 't seem that serious . I don 't think it 'll be quite a while before it gets here , if we get it . It seems as if it 's something that 's happening elsewhere and not here at the moment , so it 's not concerning me yet . The government do what government do , don 't they ? Yeah , let 's see what happens when it gets here . [ Female reporter ] Do you think the government are doing enough to prevent the virus from coming to this country ? I don 't honestly know what they could do to prevent it , but perhaps they 're not taking it seriously enough . Maybe they wait too late before they act . Do you plan to take any action yourself at all ? Don 't know . Maybe stay in a lot , avoid people . Well , there 's not a lot ... nothing I can do , love , is there ? The man on the street won 't do nothing . Doesn 't matter what we see . The government can do what they want to do . Yes , so then we 'll just go on to talk a little bit about any assistance that you 've been getting . Or not . Yes , indeed , indeed . Um , and that should pretty much cover it . - Thank you . - I think , yeah . - To look right here . - [ Man ] Focus . Sorry . Mrs. Buckley , if you can just try and not look towards the camera . Look toward Leeann . Yeah . She 'll be here , so just ... Yeah . Talk to her . [ Man ] Okay , Matt , we rolling ? [ Matt ] Yep , rolling . Okay . And , Leanne ? On your own time . Mrs. Buckley , could you begin by telling us how you were approached by the government and informed of the situation ? We were sent a letter by the local Education Trust and the Health Authority informing us of the procedures that would be taken should the virus hit any of our schools . Basically , they said that all schools would be closed forthwith . But anybody infected by the virus would then be moved to isolation units . They ... Their names would then be posted up on the internet . My concern is simple : That many , many parents have not got internet access , and they wouldn 't know where their children were . Absolutely . And what exactly did they tell you about the virus ? Well , this was the other thing . They told me just that the molecular structure of this virus was very similar to that of bird flu . Well , I found out , the virus is similar to , say for example , the common cold . So we are no further forward on that . Sure . And being a parent of two children , how does that make you feel ? Very , very worried . We have no idea about this virus . We don 't know whether it 's airborne , waterborne , whether it 's contaminated foodstuffs . We have absolutely no idea how this virus is going to affect us . We 've been told so many different things . We don 't know where we are and where we stand on this . Brilliant . Thank you very much , Mrs. Buckley . Thank you . [ Man ] Okay , great . Let 's cut it there . Thank you . I think it warmed up slightly . Yeah , I hope it stays this way . Yeah . Hey , mate . Nice and bright . Are you filming ? [ Matt ] Yeah , what do you think ? You should get a shot of this skyline . Oh , I do love it . Is this for the documentary that you 're gonna sell on the side , is it ? I gotta make my money somehow . Is this where you get our innermost thoughts ? Yes , any last-minute confessions before we ... - Yeah . ... head into the countryside - to pursue this documentary ? - Yeah , thanks . This is not my good side , by the way . [ Laughter ] I should be in there anyway . You 're only young once . Yeah , I reckon we better get going . We 've got a lot to get through today . That 's pretty cool . [ Man yawning ] Hi , Matt . Hello , mate . Andy . Bill . - What 's up ? - Seen this ? Yeah , yeah , of course . Something big has happened in New York . They 've been trying to hush it up , but the news broke to the networks a couple hours ago . The thing is , it looks now as if it 's hit London , too . Well , couldn 't it be another terrorist threat or something ? No , no . We sent a team down there half an hour ago , and we talked to a hospital worker who said that a lot of new patients were admitted last night , and they 're all from the same area , and they 're all complaining of flu-like symptoms . This morning , they 've completely sealed off the area . - Shit . - Well , they had to do it . - There 've been a lot of deaths . - Deaths ? Yeah . Well , you 'll have to excuse me . Yeah , yeah . Of course , of course . I 've got to get to this meeting and ... Sure . I 'm going to try to get home this evening , too . - Yeah . - You 're off to Sandsworth ? Yeah , yeah . I 'm meeting up with Vanessa and Leeann in about 20 minutes , I think . Good . Perhaps it 's best you 're out of the city for the time being . Look after yourself , will you ? Yeah , cheers , Bill , cheers . Now keep me posted , yeah ? Yeah . I will . [ Sighs ] [ Whispers ] Shit . Oy ! [ Woman ] All the hustle and bustle . [ Man ] All the phallic symbolism . [ Laughter ] Oh , Jesus . [ Sighs ] This don 't look good . I hope it 's not like this all the way . Blimey . Is there another way we can go ? Well , we might be able to cut through when we get further up , but it can 't be like this all the way out of London . This is a nice little village , isn 't it ? [ Matt ] Oh , this is great . Why are you filming all this ? This story could be huge . I just want to document everything . You 're just wasting tape and batteries . If he wants to film , just let him film . [ Turn signal clicking ] Hey , Manor farm . [ Man ] Got us here after all . Only three hours late . You know , you really should have taken down that farmer 's number and let him know . Some might say it 's a little unprofessional . Oh , look , we 're here now . Let 's just get this interview done quickly . Right , Leeann , I want you to , um , really press him about his feelings about culling all his poultry . [ Leeann ] Okay . And , um , oh , ask him how he 's going to cope if the government doesn 't come up with the proper compensation package , okay ? [ Leeann ] Yeah , that 's fine . Nice . More suffering and misery for the masses . All right , you think that 's it ? Um , just pull in here . I think that 'll do . There . All right , guys , let 's get this done . She does great when she 's on a mission , eh ? [ Matt laughs ] Not a good sign , is it ? Well , all the lights are on . I 'm gonna have a look around the back . And we 'll just love it if he 's not in . [ Loud knocking ] Look , he weren 't in , okay ? I 've even looked around all the fucking barns . There 's nothing . Well , we 'll just have to wait . There 's only a few hours of daylight left . I don 't want to be stuck out here in the middle of nowhere . You saw the traffic as we came in here . It 's going to take us ages to get back into London . This is a key interview . We need this one . [ Sighs ] All right , so what , then ? [ Sighs ] Well , we 'll head back to the village . There 's got to be a pub or something , yeah ? Get a bite to eat . Oh , brilliant . [ Laughter ] It 's on me . All right . [ Engine starting ] - Finally . - [ Matt ] Okay . Let 's go . [ Engine idles ] I hope we 're not stalling . [ Laughter ] What the fuck is going on now ? [ Engine revving ] What 's the matter ? It 's just ... come on , come on ! Great . This is all we need . Oh , for fuck 's sake . I don 't believe this . [ Matt ] Well , you were running it a bit hard earlier . All right . Just trying to get us in and out of here as quick as I could . Can you fix it ? What do you think , Andy ? [ Sighs ] Why don 't you two go to the pub , yeah ? And we 'll see if we can fix it . Yeah , okay . [ Sighs ] You coming ? Well , there 's no point in sitting here . Get us drinks while you 're there . Yeah . Can 't get a reception on this phone . This is bloody ridiculous . So what ? There 's nobody around anywhere ? There 's nothing in this whole village , Andy . No pubs , no shops . We tried knocking on a few doors , but no one would answer . Alice , it 's Andy . Yeah , well , we 're stuck in this bloody village of yours . Yeah , well , there 's actually no one home at the farm right now , but that 's the least of our problems . What ? When ? When did this happen ? [ Matt ] Vanessa , You got any more batteries ? Well , not unless you packed them , Matt , because that is your job , after all . Bollocks . That 's all right . Got one . Yeah , it looks like we 're stuck here then , doesn 't it ? Yeah . Thank you . Fuck ! What is it ? Those tailbacks on the way ... this thing , it 's hit London pretty bad . The underground 's been shut indefinitely . The entire transport system is down . And they 've put some kind of quarantine around three parts of the city . [ Matt ] Oh , my God . Yeah , and all the hospitals , they 've been completely overrun with new cases . It looks like Bill was right . Fuck ! Oh , I should have listened to him . All the news bulletins , they 're telling people to avoid London . What about this place , though ? We 're okay here , aren 't we , Andy ? We 're going back to the farm . Maybe they 'll let us stay the night . Have you completely lost the plot ? I 'm sorry . What 's your plan ? [ Matt ] Well , come on , guys . Let 's go back . - Yeah , whatever . - Yeah , come on . [ Knocking ] Hello ? [ Rustling , banging ] Turn that off , turn that off . [ Matt ] I can 't believe we just broke into someone 's fucking house . [ Whispers ] I thought I told you to turn the camera off . We 're breaking and entering , mate . I can 't resist . [ Laughs ] Mr. West ? Hello ? Mr. West ? Hello ? Anything ? No . Mr. West ? I don 't know if there 's anyone here . All right , well , let 's get the others anyway , yeah ? Who are you calling ? Um , I 've got this friend . He lives prob ... I don 't know , 15 , 20 minutes from here . I 'm just seeing if he 's in . Maybe he can come get us . Oh , yes . There 's no damn service on this phone . [ Sighs ] I can 't ... there 's , there 's nothing . I can 't get through . Oh , bloody hell . Try Alice again . And tell her she 'll have my resignation in the morning . This is pissing me off ! I just told you there is nothing . I can 't get through . It 's dead ! [ Leeann gasps ] Oh , jeez . What is going on ? The power cut . Shit ! What the fuck are we gonna do now ? All right , Matt , Matt , um , go check some of the other rooms . See if you can find some candles or torches or anything . [ Matt ] Yeah . [ Andy ] I 'll check around in here , yeah ? It 's coming from directly above us , I swear it is . [ Leeann ] They would have heard us . They must have heard us down here . [ Andy ] Shh , shh , listen . [ Loud thumping ] [ Gasps ] Shit ! Look , maybe , maybe it 's Mr. West , yeah ? Maybe he 's ill or something . Or he 's just been asleep . Matt , let 's go . Oh , for God 's sake , is no one listening to me ? Just stay down here , all right ? Jesus ! - [ Matt whispers ] Andy ? - Shh , shh , shh ! Something 's not right . He would have heard us . We 've gotta have a look . Shh . That 's gotta be the way in , yeah ? Shh , shh . [ Whispers ] Fuck , Matt . [ Matt whispers ] What ? Handle 's broken . Jesus ! Mr. West ? Mr. West ? Oh , my ... fuck ! Jesus Christ ! [ Breathing heavily ] Oh ! [ Moaning ] Oh-oh ! - Matt , get out of here ! - Fuck ! [ Heavy breathing ] Jesus ! - [ Loud thump ] - Aah ! Fuck ! [ Heavy breathing ] Let 's get the fuck out of here now . [ Indistinct dialogue ] [ Indistinct dialogue ] There 's some people ... Hey ! [ Leeann ] Finally , somebody 's here ! [ Matt ] I 'll go see . Guys , we really need some help here . Jesus , fuck ! Andy ! [ Groaning , screaming ] Get back to the house ! What do we do ? What do we do ? What are we gonna do ? [ Andy ] Shine it on them ! Shine it on them ! All right , then , we 're going to have to go through them . Just stay close , all right ? Stay close ! - Move , move , move ! - [ Women screaming ] [ Matt ] Go , go , go , go ! Run ! [ Women screaming ] Come on , we 're nearly there . Keep on ... [ Loud screaming ] [ Woman ] Oh , my God ! Just keep moving ! Come on ! Matt ! Come on ! Shit . [ Matt breathing heavily ] Fuck . Jesus . [ Indistinct dialogue ] [ Vanessa ] It 's a bit tight . [ Andy ] All right , how about we just ... sit tight till morning . - Yeah . - Yeah ? We 'll build some kind of a fire . Keep warm . [ Leaves rustling ] We could have been out of these woods hours ago . [ Sighs ] I just , I just ... I really don 't feel safe here . [ Andy ] Look , Leeann , if what we saw in this fucking village today was anything to go by , then this country 's in chaos . Now , we 're gonna stay in these woods . At least until the morning . Andy , you 're not thinking straight . I mean , what are we gonna eat ? That 's the least of our fucking problems right now ! There are strange dead things running around . [ Matt ] Shh ! [ Woman ] How much farther is it to Southgate ? [ Man ] Probably a few more miles . You know , I think it 's gonna be really dangerous . I just don 't think it 's worth risking our lives for what , one day 's worth of supplies ? Well , hopefully we 'll get more than that . John , what do you think ? You know , you 're really starting to piss me off ! [ John ] Oh , don 't have a go , again , love . I 've had enough of your moaning . God , it feels like we 've been traveling for days . Do you want my opinion ? All right , this is what I think . We are almost out of food , so we don 't have any choice . Yes , it 's gonna be dangerous getting out of the car , wherever we stop , but the simple fact is we can 't afford to ration our supplies anymore . The place may have been picked clean already , too . Like that place we found you , John . Yeah , we don 't have any other option . A picnic area . That 's appropriate . Elizabeth , will you bring the binoculars ? John ! What ? [ Elizabeth ] Mm , the stench is horrible . [ John ] Here , take a hold of this . [ Flies buzzing ] [ Elizabeth ] Is it dead ? You know what I mean . [ Man ] Ah . There 's your answer . [ John ] Well , it looks fairly quiet . Difficult to tell from here . We have to try to get down there without drawing too much attention to ourselves . Do you think anyone could have survived ? [ John ] Unlikely . A lot of supplies are probably gone or perished , too , but there might be stocks of something useful left . We have to make a try for it . That rifle is the only thing we 've got . What a shame we don 't live in a more gun-friendly society . Like yours . Yeah . It 's gonna be a token defense if there 's more than a handful of those things . I don 't hold out much hope of getting more ammunition , either . - John , shh ! - [ John ] What ? [ Whispering ] The body 's gone ! [ Flies buzzing ] Oh , shit ! John ! [ Elizabeth ] John ! Greg , shoot it . - Now ! You okay ? - [ John ] Yeah . I 've got to get a good shot . - [ Elizabeth ] Fuck ! Fuck ! - [ Gun blast ] You weren 't bitten , were you ? No , no , I 'm fine . I think . Shit . [ Van door opens ] [ John ] Looks like we could be okay . Did you ever imagine such a sight ? Yeah , everyone 's gone away . And by the looks of it , a long time ago . Why are we stopping here ? Well , they might have the parts for the radio in there . If not , they should at least have some tools . Keep a look out . You hear or see anything , you shout , okay ? Mind your step in there , John . [ John ] Is there anything in here worth pinching ? No , not much use for this stuff anymore . [ John ] Anything ? Hmm ? Could be . I 'm going to have to try a few of these parts out , though . [ Door closes ] [ Whispers ] Get back . [ Flies buzzing ] [ Sighs ] Just the wind . [ Wind whistling ] This place is dead . [ John ] Oh . You beauty . Do you think there 's anything in it ? Only one way to find out . Hey , careful . Well ? Let 's get Greg . [ Static ] [ Woman talking indistinctly on radio ] I got the same voice a few minutes ago . [ Radio tuning ] Could be they 're too far away ? Did you make out anything ? Not really . It was pretty garbled . That must be it there . [ John ] Shit ! [ Greg ] What 's wrong ? I saw something . [ Elizabeth ] Are you sure ? - Yeah . - I didn 't see anything . - Yeah , there 's nothing there . - I 'm not shitting you . Were you recording ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . - Check it ! No , it was definitely something . We 've got to get out of here right now . Yeah , there 's only one . There could be others . We 've got to be quick . Let 's go . John , over here . Look it . - John , come on . - Jeez . Help us out , will you ? [ Distant thumping ] Guys , can you hear that ? [ Breaking glass ] Shit , I hear it . [ Crashing ] Jesus , just leave it . The car 's close by , come on . It 's close by . [ Gunshot ] Come on , hurry . [ Gunshot ] Elizabeth , get the car started ! Shit ! [ John ] Fucking shoot it ! Fuck , let 's go . Get in ! Come on , John . [ Beeping ] [ Gunshot ] [ Man ] Jesus . [ Gunshot ] Where are they coming from ? [ Gunshot ] Come on , just leave it . [ Woman ] How many ? About nine or ten of them . It 's not good for this time of day that they 're perched together . [ Man ] Oh , yeah . Sort of . Where 's Ron ? Putting the light away . There must be something drawing them towards us . The guns blast 's bound to attract them . It 's obvious . Shit , Geoff . They 're getting good at this . That was McKenzie . Don 't touch them ! They could be contagious . If it was contagious , we 'd all have it by now . Well , I don 't like the idea of you getting any of their blood on you , especially not on your feet . That could bring the infection into the house . Ah , listen guys , let 's wait for the rain to stop and we 'll burn the bodies later . Come on . We have to do that every time we come back in , okay ? - Hey ! - [ Man ] Hey , Goke . Your feet , please . What ? I just stand in it ? Yes , you just stand in it . Happy ? It 's a great find , Geoff . Oh , give him a chance , will ya ? - Quickly . - All right . [ Man breathing heavily ] So where do I begin ? All right , uh , this is a small farm just north of Southgates in Hertfordshire , in England . Everything 's so ironic . I mean , a month ago I was writing my dissertation . And at the time , everything was terrific , you know ? But I just didn 't realize at the time , you know , how much I was just ... wasting life , you know . Pissing around . I sort of know what the people in the Twin Towers felt like . I know that sounds ... trite . They were just going about their lives , you know ? Getting on with their jobs . Biggest worry of the day being " where am I going to go for lunch ? " And then ... suddenly ... wow . Look at that . It can 't be . It 's a plane . A 767 . [ Indistinct chatter ] We 've got enough supplies to last us a few more days tops . But we 're very low on petrol now . If that runs out , we 're in real trouble . Okay . [ Sighs ] Any more luck with the radio ? No . But I spoke with Amine , and he said he should be back tomorrow . He 's found a small village he might be able to get some supplies from . This is fucking crazy . What 's going on out there in the city ? Are there any other survivors ? Hey . Next time you speak to Amine , tell him to bring more fucking fags . This Russian crap 's really getting on my tit . - You okay ? - Yeah . [ Man breathing heavily ] Come on , for fuck 's sake ! [ Gunshot ] [ Woman ] Turn off the lights ! What is it ? - [ Gunshot ] - [ Man ] Gun trouble . Give him his fucking fill ! [ Gunshot ] Fuck ! Where the fuck 's Goke ? [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] Look out ! Oh , my God ! [ Gunshot ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Woman ] Shit ! [ Heavy breathing ] James ! Go get a torch . McKenzie , go with him . Check the front of the farm . Do it now ! [ Woman whispering indistinctly ] It 's clear . [ Gunshots in distance ] - There ! - What ? I heard something . In there . Okay . Stay behind me . [ Gunshots in distance ] - [ Loud clatter ] - Shit ! [ Wings flapping ] There 's nothing here . Oh , God . Birds . We 'll clean this shit up tomorrow . Look at their eyes . Motherfucker . [ Laughs ] It 's shitty . Yeah , but it 's the only water we 've got . It stinks as well . Don 't be so fussy . You could have made yourself useful . I don 't see you going out there . Can 't you see he 's busy ? Where were you stood , anyway ? - What were you doing ? - Shining the torch . Shining the fucking torch . Get a fucking gun next time . Jesus . Oh , bollocks ! What the fuck was I supposed to do ? Try thinking for once . The van 's fucked ! Bollocks , no , it 's not ! For Christ 's fucking sake , Goke . Do you want to clean that shit off it ? The way you 're going , you 're going to have every single one of us infected . Ah , don 't be so fucking dramatic . Don 't , okay ? Don 't ! I 'm not fucking interested . And make sure he gets that shit cleaned up . Ask if they 're anywhere near a water tower . Can you see a water tower ? [ Radio static ] [ Man on radio , garbled ] No , I can 't understand what they 're saying . How do we even know that ... [ barking ] [ James ] Amine 's back . Oh . That looks almost as bad as our one . Hey , James . Good to see you , man . Hey , you , too . Good to have you back . How are you ? - I 'm all right , thanks . - Good . Amine , what the fuck happened ? What ? The juice on the side of the van . Oh , yeah , it 's , uh ... Well , you know , I 'll tell you about it later . [ Woman ] Amine ! All right ? Here 's my baby . [ Laughter ] I 'm sorry . I was asleep . Don 't worry . How are you ? Listen , whatever you do , don 't split up . Just check out the motorway . If you come across any human or animal carcasses , just fucking burn them , okay ? Yeah , sure thing . Okay , you ready ? [ James ] Yeah , let 's do this . Be careful , guys . See you . [ Greg ] Hello ? What 's your location ? Over . [ Radio static ] [ Woman on radio , garbled ] [ Static ] [ Sigh ] I think we 're out of range , but these things don 't cover a huge distance , and they may not be too far away . [ John ] Well , keep trying . I 'll go and check on Elizabeth . Okay . [ Radio static ] Any luck ? [ John ] No , still too far away . What could you make out ? Anything ? Well , the signal was getting stronger , so we could be heading in the right direction , but ... How are you ? I 'm worried . What if we never get away from it ? You know , we could be running forever . Hey , we 'll be fine . Just need to find others like us , you know ? [ Greg ] John ! John ! Oh , my God , Greg ! Aah ! [ Groaning ] Aah ! [ Click ] Shit . [ Greg crying ] I 'm finished . [ Crying ] Hot , Elizabeth . It fucking hurts . It fucking ... shit . [ Breathing heavily ] God ! [ Sobbing ] John , it 's really bad . He needs proper medical attention . [ Greg sobbing ] What are we going to do ? We 'll keep heading south . It must be where they are . We need to get you some proper help . Oh , why the hell are we going this way ? Because there was no way through . This should get us back onto the main road . Get a hold of that map and see if you can 't pinpoint where we are . Does it head back onto the main road ? Uh , yeah , it seems to . Does it join further down there or not ? Okay , okay . I think he 's fainted . Greg ? Greg , are you okay , honey ? Leave him , Elizabeth . Shut up . Greg , please wake up . Oh , fuck ! Greg ! [ Crash ] Elizabeth ! No , Elizabeth ! [ John ] Come on , leave her . - Come on . - Get the fuck off me ! Come on , keep moving . We 're not far enough away . [ Coughing ] - You all right ? - [ Wheezing ] Can you keep moving ? Yeah ? Well , come on , then . [ Coughing , heaving ] Do you think they 'll follow us this far ? Doesn 't matter how far we go . They 'll still find us . Well , we 're not giving up yet . I already have . Well , I haven 't . We can still find help . I don 't want to remember her that way . [ Coughing ] [ Wheezing ] You 're with them now . [ Gun cocks ] [ Gunshot ] [ Panting ] [ Coughing ] [ Panting ] Shit . What the fuck is this place ? Oh , jeez . [ John ] Fuck ! [ Grunting , screaming ] Aah ! Aah ! [ Panting , whimpering ] [ Thud ] Ahh ! Uhh ! - [ Gunshot in distance ] - Shit ! [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Gunshot in distance ] [ Metallic squeaking ] - [ Chuckling softly ] - [ Gunshot in distance ] - [ Laughing ] - [ Gunshots continue ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ Gunshot ] [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Gunshots ] [ James ] What the fuck ? Wait , guys ! - What 's happening ? - It 's Amine . It looks like he 's got an infected cut . What ? Are you sure ? I don 't know , but Geoff thinks he has the virus . Fuck ! Basically Amine , he went to bed because he was feeling really knackered . And then about ten minutes later , he called Sue in , and she just started panicking . Apparently , he was throwing up and sweating buckets . [ Panting , coughs ] [ Thunder rumbling ] James . You okay to do the watch tonight ? Sure . No , I mean , do you want to do the watch ? Me and Goke can cover for you if you want . Sue 's insisting on sitting in there all night . After what happened it 's not surprising , is it ? How 's Amine ? Not good . He 's lost consciousness . For fuck 's sake . This is really bad . Yeah , really bad . I 've had to , uh , persuade Sue to let me tie him up . Anyway , look . Let me and Goke do the watch . You did a really good job today . I appreciate it . You go get some rest , all right ? Okay . Cheers . [ Goke ] Come on , you big fuddy ! [ Wheezing ] How is he ? [ James ] Not good . Sue 's in there with him and won 't let anyone else in . Oh , shit . - Did you hear the gunshots this morning ? - No . Yeah , some more of those things coming out of the woods . You sure you guys checked the area properly yesterday ? I think so . Amine coming back totally distracted me . I should have sent you guys out much earlier , and I should have gone with you . I 'll tell you what , James . We 're going to go back out there . This time , we check every last inch , okay ? We 'll take your camera and record anything unusual , not just you talking crap this time . Come on . [ James ] Looks like someone 's been here before . Look . See those buildings ? Did you check them yesterday ? [ James ] No , I guess I must have missed them . What ? What were you guys doing yesterday ? Well , we checked more towards the other side of the motorway . I knew it was a mistake to let Goke do this . That looks like a problem . Looks like they 're spilling in from the motorway into those barns . Probably because there 's some dead animal carcass in them or something . When they have their joy getting in , they probably just carrying on walking towards the farm . Not a sound , okay ? [ Clattering ] [ Whispers ] Come on . Careful , Geoff . - Oh , man . Jesus Christ . - Oh , fucking hell . Ugh . - Oh . Jesus . - Shh . The stink . Oh , Jesus fucking Christ ! - Fuck . - Oh ! [ Flies buzzing ] What the fuck ? - What the fuck ? - Who is she ? Stay there . Stay there . Fucking woman . Oh , fuck . - Oh , jeez . - [ Rasping ] Oh , God , she 's fucking infected ! Jesus Christ ! Get out of here . Just , um ... - [ struggling ] - [ Metal rattling ] James , get ... Don 't look at this . - [ Gunshot ] - Oh , fuck . Fuck ! Fuck ! - Geoff . Geoff ! - [ Cocks rifle ] Geoff , listen to me . We split up . What ? Yes , yesterday ... yesterday Goke ... Goke sent me down by the fields ... - Goke ? - Goke . He came and checked this area out . He must have known about this . - Known about this ? - Yeah . Jesus Christ ! What were you thinking ? - You idiot ! - I don 't ... - [ sighs ] - Geoff , we 've got to go . We 've got to go back . You 're fucking right we got to go back . If Goke finds out we 've been here ... No more reason than a fucking animal ! Oh , give it a rest , James . The guy 's a sick fuck . You spent some time with him . You 're telling me you had no clue ? Huh ? Jesus Christ . Shit . Back up ! Give me some room . Fuck ! I 'm sick of this shit ! Come on . James , come on ! If Goke gets wind of this , we 're fucked . Okay ? You saw what he did . I know what he did , but let me handle it , okay ? Just give me some time and I 'll sort it out . Geoff , what are you going to do to him ? I 'll handle it in my own way , okay ? Just give me some time . What are you going to do to him ? You 've got to calm down . - Geoff . - Just shut the fuck up . - Where have you been ? - Hey . - Hi . You all right ? - Yeah . Guys , where have you been ? Why didn 't you tell us you were going ?

Let me have a look . Just a second . [ Stumbling ] [ Gasp ] Oh , be careful . I can 't see anything . Jesus , we need some fucking weapons or something , don 't we ? It could be anything . It could be a ... It could be a deer or something . [ Click ] [ Leeann screams ] Oh , God . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . That 's far enough . Stay there . Fuck . We found someone tonight . What are you guys doing back there ? Obviously nothing . We ... We saw ... just this piece of wood . Ignore it . Uh , I 'm ... I 'm Goke , and this is Manny . We ... We 're just trying to find some help , mate . Our friend , he 's real ill back in Hinkston , and it 's fucking chaos back there . Man , we 're just trying to reach through to Sandsworth . You can forget about Sandsworth , that 's for sure . You just come from there ? Yeah . Look , guys , we just saw the fire , so we headed towards there . It 's ... Manny ... [ nervous laugh ] ... we 're on camera . Is that what it is ? Could you ... Should I ask what you people are doing out here with that thing ? [ Vanessa ] We 're making a documentary . Out in the woods at this time ? Sounds like my kind of film . It 's about the virus , actually . [ Matt ] Yeah , we were filming in Sandsworth earlier . It 's really bad out there . That place is infected . Shh ! It 's the same everywhere . [ Whispering ] Oh , bollocks . Well , you know , we 're really sorry if we scared you . I wasn 't trying to do seriously nothing . I got a pack of fags here if you want . [ Andy ] No . All right . - You sure ? - Yeah , yeah . We didn 't mean to scare you guys , seriously . All right . It 's ... It 's fine . You can understand , you know ? We just got quite a scare back in the town . Do you want it ? [ Matt ] Yeah . Go on , then . Seems like a good time to start , eh ? How many of you are there ? [ Andy ] There 's four of us . [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Goke ] Can we , uh , sit down ? Yeah , yeah . Come on , come on . [ Manny ] Cheers . You see , Hinkston is on the other side of these woods . I mean it separates the two villages . So , I mean , your best bet is now probably heading north to the Sounds , I guess . At home it 's rife with the disease . Trouble is we don 't have a compass , though . Fuck knows where we are now . [ Vanessa ] Well ... I don 't know . How long you guys been in here ? Just what , a couple of hours ? - [ Vanessa ] Seems like forever . - Yeah . After what I saw today , I don 't think any fucking doctor can help those guys . Can 't have them fall that far , I guess , just till I find somebody who can help us , somebody who knew anything about medicine . Well ... Uh ... that 's not us . [ Chuckle ] Well , anyway ... we best be off . Manny . Yeah . [ Andy ] It 's pitch black out there . We 're heading off in the morning . You 're welcome to stay with us . [ Vanessa ] Yeah , stay with us . Safety in numbers , guys . Uh , seriously , we can 't stay that long . We got to keep on pushing on . Yeah . Our friend 's in pretty bad state . But thanks , though . But , uh , we got to be going . [ Andy ] All right . Good luck . And good luck to you , too . Cheers . [ Manny ] Thanks for the drink . [ Vanessa ] I hope you find what you need . I hope you find your way out . Take care of yourselves . It 's not safe out here . [ Andy ] Yeah . [ Vanessa ] Yeah . Just be careful . [ Matt ] Thanks for the fag , mate . [ Manny ] Come on . Here we go . [ Vanessa ] See you . [ Andy ] Watch your backs , guys . Personally , I think they 're insane going out into the woods now , but it 's up to them . [ Vanessa ] Yeah . I just want to get out of here today . Leeann ! Leeann ! She 's not been this way . Oh , for fuck 's sake . Leeann ! Fucking stupid girl . Leeann ! Leeann ! [ Gunshot ] Leeann ! [ Gunshot ] You hear those gunshots ? Was that gunshots ? Oh , great . Just what we fucking need . What the fuck is going on ? Maybe she 's gone into town , yeah ? She ain 't going to go on her own , is she ? You saw what she was like last night . She 's in her own fucking state . She don 't even know where the fucking town is . Leeann ! So what do we do ? Jesus Christ , Andy , I 'm really fucking worried now . Leeann ! All right , look , Matt , get the camera and check down that side . Vanessa , we 'll go check over there . She 's got to be around somewhere , hasn 't she ? She can 't have just fucking disappeared . - Come on . Let 's go . Matt , stay within shouting distance , yes ? Yeah . Okay . [ Rapid breathing ] [ Moaning ] [ Manny ] Aw , does it hurt ?

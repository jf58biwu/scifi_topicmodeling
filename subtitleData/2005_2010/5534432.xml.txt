 Mars will enter Capricorn on the 17th , but beware ! Mercury is moving retrograde through Scorpio , which can mean only one thing . A vital letter will be lost in the post ! I 'll look out for that . Can you see anything else ? What if I do leave the carpet shop ? Will I find another job ? Yes . Saturn signifies a new occupation in communications . I see a call centre . With better money ? Jupiter , the planet of abundance , is traversing the fifth house . There will be better money for all those born under the sign of Gemini . Fantastic ! For both of us ! You 're Gemini too , aren 't you ? Sign of the twins . Two faces . TIMER BEEPS That 's this session over , Cheryl . Thanks . You 're brilliant , Martin . My husband says I 'm mad , coming to see you . He says none of your predictions come true . Like when I was gonna win a holiday , we were going to move to Scotland . " The stars work in mysterious ways . " They do indeed . I said , " So what if we fall behind on the mortgage , " Martin is worth every penny ! " No , no , stop . Cheryl , I can 't take your mortgage money . What ? I 'm a fraud . Say again ? I won 't take your money cos I was just making it all up . There 's no power in the stars . Please , please . I can 't take the money . I can 't believe I 'm hearing this ! The stars guide everything we do ! You think anything up there has any influence down here , on you and me ? Do you really believe there is such a thing as destiny ? If only there was . When I was a kid , I was convinced I was gonna do great things . It was fate ! But I failed in everything I tried , all my life . And I end up like this - a con artist . What was that ? Martin ? Mr Trueman ? You all right ? At last . What just happened there ? Gemini , you are going on a long journey . A very long journey . Agghh ! The only reason I 'm down here is because this is free . All these horoscopes , signs of the zodiac , it 's so sad . Come on , Clyde , everyone checks their stars . I 'm Aries . What sign are you ? Look , I 'm not getting into this . His birthday is June 5th . Right . Gemini . Funny , popular . Oh , yeah . Well , maybe there is something in it . Lazy , shallow ... There . You see ? It 's rubbish . How about you , then , Luke ? Astrology has no scientific basis . It 's based on primitive observations and a fundamental misunderstanding of the way the universe works . Thanks . I meant what 's your sign , when 's your birthday ? I don 't have one . Good evening . If I could just ask you to write down your names and dates of birth and put them in the box here . - Do we have to ? - Everyone has to . It 's part of the show . An essential part of the show . What do I put ? I don 't have a star sign . I wasn 't born . Sorry , I forgot . What about the day you were , erm ... Switched on . Activated . Man , what am I doing here ? This is no way to spend a Friday night . I should be out there , moving , shaking . Or doing your homework ? Dad ! You weren 't coming . He 's so narrow-minded . I said to him , " How can you dismiss it , if you don 't give it a chance ? " I wasn 't expecting you here , Mum . Nice to spend time with some adults . This Trueman 's pulling in all these people . Who knows ? There might be a story in it . You work too hard . I 've been telling her , she needs a night out . Tonight 's performance of Secrets Of The Stars with Martin Trueman will begin in five minutes . We want good seats . Do you believe in astrology ? No , but I 'm always willing to be convinced . Just not expecting to be convinced . Cheryl , I need to talk to you . Stuart , how nice to see you . Why not come and see the show ? No . I don 't want to see the show . I want you to come back home . I 've made my decision , Stuart . I 'm staying with Mr Trueman . He 's done something to you . I can see it , Cheryl , it 's in your eyes . Typical Scorpio , jealous and obsessive . I 'm the same as I 've always been . I 'm not leaving here without you ! Go , Stuart . Or should I call the police ? Maybe it 's me that should be calling them ! Something 's wrong here . Hang on , there 's your story . I knew it . What 's wrong ? I can 't even have one night out without something weird happening . Come on . Martin Trueman says , " I travelled through life without meaning " until suddenly I felt the power of the stars . " Oh ! Sarah , Rani ! Over here ! Sarah Jane . My name is Sarah Jane . That 's what I said ! Never mind . Budge up . Never sit in the middle or you 're trapped . FANFARE PLAYS From the dawn of time , Man has looked up to the stars for guidance . Tonight , the secrets of the stars will be revealed to you . Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome Mr Martin Trueman ! Thank you , thank you . How nice to see you all ! Welcome , welcome ! Oh ! Thank you for coming . Ladies , a couple of Golden Girls here ! He 's a bit milky , isn 't he ? Cheesy . For the hundredth time , the word is cheesy . Young man , welcome . Welcome , thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Ladies and gentlemen , tonight I 'd like to share my journey with you . I was a nothing , a nobody , until I learned the secrets of the stars . In some ways , I feel as if I was chosen . There is so much more in the universe than what we can see from here on Earth . There are 200 billion stars in our galaxy alone . Huge , shifting stellar forces , pulsing with ancient light . You didn 't come here for a science lesson , did you ? No ! So let 's try a bit of showbiz , shall we ? Now , who in the audience tonight was born on May 29th ? What about June 16th ? How about June 5th ? What did I do that for ? Down . Down . Down . Up ! Down . Up ! Down . Up ! That 's enough , thank you ! Down ! Oh , no , no . A round of applause , please , for my three accomplices ! How did he do that ? The power of suggestion . It 's simple stuff , a parlour trick . Nobody ever mentions that again , OK ? Don 't worry , you were really funny . I choose when I 'm funny . Not him . .. Mystery box in the foyer . My assistant , the lovely Cheryl , has printed up your birth charts . Thank you , Cheryl . So if we 're ready , we 'll begin , shall we ? I 'm looking for a Diane Cope . That 's me . Diane , your Pisces moon indicates a love of learning . I think perhaps you 've just gone back to college ? Yes , that 's true . She 's a plant . A vegetable life form ? It means he knows her . He 's planted her in the audience . You study history and sociology . She looks genuine to me . Yes . So let 's try somebody else , shall we ? Where 's Rani Chandra ? Oh , wow ! Here she is ! Rani , now please would you confirm that you and I have never met before ? No , we 've never met before . Thank you . In your chart , Mercury is in conjunction with Neptune . Am I right in thinking that you 've just moved house ? Yes . You 're right . In fact , your whole life is changing . You suddenly see the world in a new light . It 's exciting , and you love it . Yes . Incredible ! An anchoring influence in your life is represented by Saturn . A Taurus man , someone very calm and reliable ? Is it your dad ? A teacher ? It 's my husband , he 's here ! And there 's Mum , a Gemini , of course ! Thank you , Rani . Now . I 'm being strangely drawn to a Sarah Jane Smith . That 's me . Ah , Taurus ! Strong , determined . You were born under a very special star , Neptune in your fifth house . Some years ago you travelled far and wide and the things you have seen ! And there was a man , a very special man . No , no . Let me think . It wasn 't a romance . No , no , it was something much , much more than that . He taught you so much . There was laughter and adventure , and you prayed that your time with him would never , never end . But then , suddenly , he left you . I knew there was a bloke somewhere . What did I say ? Broken heart . A man with no name . He 's upsetting her . A scientist ? No . A doctor . The Doctor ! Hello , Sarah Jane . Doctor . It 's you , isn 't it ? Am I right ? Yes , you 're right . But you tell me right now , how do you know that ? It 's all in your stars , and there 's Jupiter in your 12th house . You are the keeper of secrets . If you 're so clever , tell me about the future . If you want . Oh ! I 'm afraid Saturn is transiting Taurus . You have fought many battles in your life , you 're about to fight another . But this time it will be different . This time , Sarah Jane , you lose . He probably just looked it all up on the internet . He didn 't have the time ! He got it exactly right for everyone . And as for you , Secret Sarah , woman of mystery ! Come on , what are you hiding ? And who is this Doctor , he sounds gorgeous ! Come on , Mum . See you later . Bye ! See you on Monday , lads . How could he know so much about you ? How could he make me bounce up and down ? It was like I had to . If he knows about the Doctor ... Excuse me . .. he could be an alien . No , I did a scan . Trueman is human . We 'll see what Mr Smith says . Another good show , Martin . Wonderful . A pity it had to be the last performance , but the shows have served their purpose . Tomorrow , I will speak to the entire world ! But how ? Only people here know of you , Martin . It is destined . Any moment now . KNOCK ON DOOR Hey , Mr Trueman . Great show . Lisa Trotter . I 've seen you on TV . Paranormal Planet on the Psychic Channel ? Yeah that 's right . Actually , we 're doing a live interview tomorrow but we 've had some bad luck . Our guest Celestial Deirdre ... Do you know her ? I am familiar with her work . Anyways , she 's had an accident , had to drop out . Oh , dear . Nothing serious , I hope ? Well , she says she fell down the stairs at home . Which is a bit strange , actually because , come to think of it , she lives in a bungalow . How very unfortunate . Is there anything I can do to help ? Well , I know it 's a bit short notice , but I 'd really love you to step in as our guest . Of course . That would be wonderful ! Great ! You 're a lifesaver ! Yes . Well , I want to get my message across to as many people as possible . What a wonderful surprise . Yeah . Surprised you didn 't see it coming ! Mr Smith ! I need you ! Good evening , Sarah Jane . What can I do for you ? Mr Smith , I want you to scan the area around the New Theatre , East Acton . Look for anything unusual or alien . Psychic energy , yeah ? We know that 's real . You almost brought the moon crashing down . No ! That is not what Trueman is about . He can see into people 's lives , see into their destinies . By mind-reading . By calculating the positions of the stars when they were born - impossible . Sarah Jane , scan completed . I have detected no irregularities in the vicinity . There must be something . Atmospheric disturbance , energy spike ? There has been no such event . What if it 's real ? How could we detect it ? We don 't even believe in it . Say that again . Wow ! Have I finally done it ? Yes ! I have confused you . Think , think , think , think , think , think . Of course ! He must be using a bio-damper . What 's that ? Washing powder ? An alien device used for shielding high technology emissions . Mr Smith , I need you to locate a man called Martin Trueman . I can feel the power of the stars , not just the ones we can see . Suns , planets , whole galaxies , shifting and turning cogs in the great machine of the universe . The conjunction is perfect . Right now , across that infinite distance , the Ancient Lights are aligned precisely with me . And tomorrow , the television broadcast . It is destined . Soon the whole world will know my blessing . But I have an opponent , Sarah Jane Smith . Now that Taurus is rising , she will try and prevent the broadcast . But you will stop her ? Oh , yes . She can 't interfere . All the forces of destiny are gathered against her ! COOKERY PROGRAMME ON TV I 'm off to see Trueman , then . I 've reset the scanner to search for bio-damper interference patterns . It might just work . Hey , what 's up ? Last night , everyone was talking about their star signs , and I don 't have one . I could give you a birthday if you want - the day I found you . I wasn 't born though , Mum . I was activated . Happy Activation Day ! It doesn 't sound right , does it ? It 's another strange thing , something else that sets me apart . Whatever particular day it is , that doesn 't matter . You 're celebrating the person . But where you come from , a childhood , it makes people who they are . I come from nowhere . I was never a baby . Oh , Luke . I thought it would get easier but there are always new things coming along , like this , to make me feel different . Just remember you 're strong . I 've seen you learn - you 're my son and you 're brilliant . That 's me . What 's my brilliant son going to do today ? I thought I 'd look for some clues . Read up on astrology with Mr Smith . Fantastic . Well , I 'd better be off ... if you 're all right ? See you later . Morning , Sarah Jane ! I 'm off to see Trueman . You made an appointment ? Oh , no . This is going to be an old-fashioned foot in the door job . Need another pair of feet ? The origins of astrology are lost in the mists of time . It says the earliest record of astrology was in Babylon , in the 16th century BC . It is older than that , not just here on Earth . Primitive cultures across the universe charted the patterns of the stars . This is the zodiac of the planet Ventiplex . And this is the zodiac of Draconia . There 's astrology in the cultures of other planets ? Yes , Luke . A similar system operates in the culture of almost every inhabited planet . So it 's everywhere . That 's the one . What if he tells us to clear off ? First rule of journalism , never take no for an answer . I learnt that lesson a long time ago . Miss Smith , please , come in . So , I 've done some research and up until about two months ago , you led a pretty quiet life . Oh , no , no , no , Miss Smith . I made a lot of noise , but nobody ever listened . Now you declare yourself the new Messiah of the zodiac . Oh , she 's good . Your protege , like you when were the Doctor 's protege ? Is she YOUR companion ? How do you know about the Doctor ? ! We come from two different worlds , Miss Smith . I 'm a believer , you are a sceptic . No common ground . How can I explain myself to you ? How can you tell I don 't believe you ? I 've read your chart . You 're both fighters . Adventure , excitement , battles against the most remarkable things . Oh , scan away , please , you won 't find anything . People like you have to scan everything . Where does that get you in the end ? There is no end , there doesn 't have to be . Learning , finding out about the universe , that 's all the wonder and beauty I 'll need . Often it 's more than enough . It 's such a shame that it has got to end , and I can 't have you standing in my way . I 've got things to do , such amazing things ! Whatever you 're planning , I 'm going to stop it ! Oh ! Oh , a threat ! He taught you well , didn 't he , the Doctor ? But he 's not here . Not this time ! And poor little Rani ! You 've been lying to her mother , haven 't you ? Oh , dear , Miss Smith ! Allowing children into your dangerous world ! Come on , Rani , we 're leaving ! Yes , yes , you are ! You see , I have received a special gift . Observe ! I can channel all the power of the stars ! Your choice , Sarah Jane ! Keep away from us , or ... .. the Ancient Lights will destroy you ! Get in ! Now she 'll keep away . No , she 's a Taurus . Among other things . Determined , brave . She 'll keep interfering . I 'll deal with her . No , no . I need you with me . I shall have to use somebody else . Wait ! Last night . That boy sitting on her right . Clyde Langer . Gemini ! I 'll see you then , Finney . Laters . Clyde . We need to talk . What ? About your destiny . Stand still . Turn to me . You won 't be needing that . Mr Smith , I need ... Mum ? What 's happened ? Nearly got zapped by Trueman . Where does he get his zapping power ? He said , " Ancient Lights , " whatever it means . Mr Smith , analyse the damage to this fabric . What caused it ? The fabric has been burnt . By what ? By nothing . That doesn 't make any sense . Nothing has burnt the fabric . But it 's been burnt ? Mr Smith can 't detect by what . How can we detect something we don 't believe in ? The power of the Ancient Lights , what if it is astrology ? What if astrology is true ? It can 't be true . It 's contrary to physics . I 'll call Clyde . He won 't want to miss this . Whoa ! How did I get here ? I made you want to come here . You 're one of the lucky ones . It 's your destiny . MOBILE PHONE RINGS Oh ! Rani calling . Here , give that back ! Down . Not today , thank you . What are you gonna do to me ? There 's nothing to be afraid of . You have been chosen to join my inner circle . Life is going to be far less complicated for you . Accept the Ancient Lights . No answer . It must be on silent . He never puts it on silent , not even in school . He 's probably just got his headphones on . So , this energy . We saw it . It exists . Hang on . Astrology breaks the laws of physics . What are you getting at ? Well , what if the Ancient Lights come from a place where the laws of physics are different , so they can break ours ? That 's like saying you could break the law of gravity . Maybe that 's why Mr Smith said " nothing " burnt my jacket . What if the Ancient Lights is a different kind of energy to anything we know ? No , Rani . The laws of physics are the same across the universe . Our universe . But what if the Ancient Lights are from another one ? I 'll do as you said , Mr Trueman . I know I can rely on you , Clyde ! Now we must be on our way . One last performance . It wouldn 't do to keep the world waiting . Mr Smith said every galaxy has its own form of astrology - not just Earth . What if astrology is a kind of memory of a time before ? Explain . 13 billion years ago , the universe was created . A massive explosion , the Big Bang . What was there before ? Nobody knows . Another universe ? Where the physics were different . Where astrology worked . This energy survived the Big Bang . The Ancient Lights ! So they 're very ancient . What have they done the last 13 billion years ? Why pick Trueman ? May I make a suggestion ? Go ahead , Mr Smith . If Luke 's theory is correct , the energy form has been waiting for exactly the right astrological conditions across the universe . Trueman 's birth chart is a vital part of that equation . He is the channel the energy needs . Needs him for what , though ? What does it want ? Yeah . It can 't have waited that long just to appear on a stage in Acton . Sarah Jane , my media sensor reports that Martin Trueman is about to appear live on the television . Shall I relay the image ? Yes , please . We 're here at the New Theatre in East Acton , where astrologer Martin Trueman has been creating a buzz with some amazing live shows . Hi , Martin . Hello , Lisa . Right . Before the show I gave you my date of birth , so what can you tell me about myself ? Well , Lisa , you are a very trusting person . I don 't like this . It 's the Psychic Channel . We probably doubled their ratings . Information - this television programme is now being broadcast on channels around the world . Oh , it 's him , Martin Trueman . Why are you watching this ? I wasn 't . Must 've sat on the remote . .. are using you just to get what they want , and you find yourself somehow pushed aside ? Again , that is so true . Yes , and it 's very convenient for me . You see , you are not important any more . You 've served your purpose . Remove them ! That 's better . Now we can begin . This is a very important day . The most important day in all of our lives . He can 't be on all the channels ! Come on ! Just one thing before we get started . I cast a horoscope earlier today for a ... a " client " . And I think she might be looking in . She 's going to be having quite a difficult time of it right now . Her problem is she can 't help asking questions . How is he doing it ? Mr Smith ? I can detect no interference with the television signal . How could you ? It 's the power of the stars , the old universe . Interfering in other people 's affairs - she really should stop ... .. or people could get hurt . We 're going to the theatre . But how are we going to stop Trueman ? You can 't stop him ! Clyde ? Where have you been ? I 've turned to the stars ! Now , ladies and gentlemen , don 't be scared . Clyde ! Clyde , what 's happening ? What 's Trueman done to you ? He 's given me power ! No , Clyde , no ! Mr Smith , what 's happening ? Nothing is happening . Nothing is happening . Clyde ! It 's the dawning of a new age . The power of the Ancient Lights is reborn ! Welcome to the future ! Sarah Jane , you must be destroyed ! Nothing is happening . Nothing is happening . Nothing is happening . I have a message for the world . Children of Gemini , join the Ancient Lights . This thing that 's possessed you , it 's alien . Sarah Jane , it 's got my mum ! Since the broadcast , people have been hypnotised and have walked out of their homes . Children of Leo , join the circle . He 's taking over all the star signs one by one . My destiny is now !

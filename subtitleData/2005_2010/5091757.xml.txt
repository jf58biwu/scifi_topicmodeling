 NARRATOR : Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : - Get to the safe house before night . - The safe house in the desert ? - Hey , desert 's that way . SARAH : Taking a detour . Who lives here ? Charlie ? WEAVER : John Henry was infiltrated . MURCH : Someone out there wants to kill him . [ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ] [ TASER CLICKING ] [ GRUNTING ] I don 't know which one is his . DEREK : Doesn 't matter . Grass , trees . Could do worse . Could . It 's been 25 years . DEREK : Desert . You said meet us in the desert . - I did . - Funny thing about the desert you don 't find many lighthouses there . We stopped to see Charlie . So you did . - Charlie 's dead . - So I heard . - From who ? - John . - He called you too ? - Good thing . Might not have found you . My brother buried out there , I thought that counted for something between us . Well , John counts for more . And you keep too many secrets for my tastes . I 'm sorry about Charlie . - Well , everybody dies for me , right ? - John . I found this on the body at the lighthouse . Who is it ? I don 't know , but I 've seen her . - Where ? - Dr . Sherman 's office . The shrink from the list ? I think she was a patient there . Probably the one we were looking for . They tried to kill us . They have a picture of this girl . It means something . We all know we 're going , so let 's just go . All right , everyone , go to your Learn-a-Word program . I 'm gonna give you 10 new words . You 'll put them in the search box , and then- - [ GIGGLES ] Savannah ? Maybe you 'd like to tell the class what 's so funny ? Um ... . Nothing . - That doesn 't look like Learn-a-Word . - I 'm just chatting . - With whom ? - My friend . Who 's your friend ? TEACHER : She said his name was John Henry . John Henry ? I 'm sure it 's made up . These types of predators often use pseudonyms . I see . A grown man contacting a girl this age ... . I don 't have to tell you , Ms. Weaver there are some troubled people out there . - Yes , there are . - Some of them look perfectly normal . Yes , they do . Well , I hate to think what can happen if he finds out where she lives . I appreciate you bringing this to my attention . I 'll talk to her . WEAVER : Why were you talking to John Henry during class ? I was teaching him the words to a song . - What song ? - The one Daddy used to sing . I want John Henry to sing it with me . - Maybe I could sing it with you . - You 're not a boy , and you can 't sing . Fine . We won 't sing . But what you do have to do , is pay attention to the teacher . She said bad things about John Henry . What did she say ? She said if you talk to somebody on the computer they could come to your house and hurt you . John Henry would never hurt you but there are people who wouldn 't understand him . People are afraid of things they don 't understand . If they knew him , they 'd like him . That may be . For now , I don 't want you to talk to anyone about him . - Is that clear ? - Okay , I won 't . I 'll see you tonight . What are you looking at ? - Myself . - Why ? Do you have a brother , Mr. Ellison ? - Yes . In Atlanta . - Does he look like you ? People seem to think so . Do you think my brother looks like me ? John Henry , wherever your brother might be he 's a computer . He doesn 't look like anyone . He certainly doesn 't have your face . I know that , Mr. Ellison . I simply meant , I wonder how similar his data is to my data . I wonder if we share the same thoughts . I have no idea . But I imagine you 're unique . Yes , I am unique . We may still reach many of the same conclusions ... - ... given similar data sets . - You may think alike . I 'd like to know if we do . The human brain is an amazing computer . Its raw clock speed is 20 billion calculations per second . Its storage is functionally infinite . - But it 's flawed . - How 's that ? There 's nowhere to download it when you die . Not exactly , no . Your Bible solves this problem by introducing the concept of heaven . - Yes . - Billions of souls with no bodies . Okay . JOHN HENRY : Yet all this is required simply to process the unique entity you call John Henry . Yes . It 's possible heaven has a hardware problem . It 's not that simple . I need to know what my brother is thinking , Mr. Ellison . I need to know what he plans to do . I don 't wanna die again . Do you think you can be a little angel while I do turbo body crunches ? - I still have math . I 'm adding . - Okay . [ RINGING ] - Hello ? I can 't talk right now . JOHN HENRY : Why not ? SAVANNAH [ OVER SPEAKERS ] : I 'm doing my homework . But I have an idea . You can come over and do math with me . I have to go . I can 't hold the phone and write my numbers . JOHN HENRY [ OVER PHONE ] : Use the headset . You can talk and work simultaneously . Si ... . - Simul ... . - Simultaneously . It means , " to occur at the same time . " Coterminous . Oh . - John Henry ? - Hello , Savannah . What does " coterminous " mean ? Hello ? [ EQUIPMENT BEEPING ] John Henry ? Hello ? John Henry ? [ DOORBELL RINGS ] DEBBIE : Hi . JOHN HENRY : Savannah , listen to my voice . - I 'm scared . Do as I say , and you will not be harmed . But you 'll have to finish your homework later . [ PHONE RINGS ] [ ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS ] MAN [ OVER ANSWERING MACHINE ] : Hello , Mrs. Weaver ? This is RNE Security . We detected an unauthorized entrance at your front gate . Do you require assistance ? Mrs. Weaver , we 're sending a unit to your home . - Now come out of there . SAVANNAH : I don 't want to . Don 't worry . I can tell you where to go . Who 's that man ? JOHN HENRY [ OVER HEADSET ] : The water delivery man . - Where 's Debbie ? - Debbie 's in the foyer . We 're not going that way . Go to the garage . SAVANNAH : Where do I go now ? John Henry ? [ STATIC HISSING OVER SPEAKERS ] [ BEEPING ] John Henry . [ DOOR CLICKS ] JOHN : Hey . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . No , no . It 's okay . It 's okay . [ SAVANNAH SCREAMS ] Come on . [ GLASS CRASHING ] Okay , go , go , go . [ GRUNTING ] JOHN : Come here , come here . JOHN : It 's okay . Come on . Keep moving . [ SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE ] Keep moving . Detective Crayton , L.A.P.D. - James Ellison . Head of Security . CRAYTON : I know who you are , Mr. Ellison . ELLISON : What happened ? There was an attack on the residence . Alarm went off . Security arrived , found the nanny dead . There was a pretty ugly firefight . Four security guards killed , plus one of the gunmen . - Daughter missing . - Any ID on the gunman ? No ID . We 're waiting for ballistics , coroner 's report . - Anyone call with demands ? CRAYTON : No . There 's an Amber Alert out . We 've set up a command post in the lobby . Officers posted throughout the building . I 'm putting 24-hour protection on Ms. Weaver . How are you holding up ? The detective wants to speak with Savannah 's friends . I made a list . But I 'm concerned I may have left someone off . If you can think of anyone else Savannah spends time with . I 'll take a look . Excuse me . Thank you . Mr. Ellison . When I said I knew who you were , I didn 't mean anything bad by that . ELLISON : You know things are rough when " I know you " can be taken as an insult . Anyway , no offense . None taken . So how do you like the private sector ? - I get a better car . - Nice . Anything you can tell me about Weaver ? Not much to tell . Husband died a couple years ago . She didn 't talk about that much ? She doesn 't talk about much much . What 's her relationship with her daughter like ? They seem close . - Have any enemies ? - Not that I know of . I hate these cases . We 'll find her . Why did you stop looking for Sarah Connor ? - Well , she , um , died eight years ago . - No , that 's not true . So you accept she 's alive ? - Sarah Connor was at the house ? - Alive . Obviously , yes . Did she take Savannah ? So it doesn 't surprise you she 's alive . No , it doesn 't surprise me . You lied about what you know . Did she take Savannah ? - I tried to help but could not . - Did Sarah Connor kill those guards ? - No . - Then who was she shooting at ? Him . We should tell Ms. Weaver . No . I don 't think we should tell anyone . Mr. Ellison you 're asking me to keep a secret . You tell me it 's wrong to lie , yet you keep doing it . I know what I said , John Henry . But in this case , a lie might save someone . How ? Our best chance to get Savannah back is for me to handle this . Quietly . You understand ? Is Sarah Connor going to hurt Savannah ? No . Would she harm me ? - Why do you ask that ? - She blew up Cyberdyne . She killed Miles Dyson . His work is in my code . Right now , the most important thing is to find Savannah . Who is she ? She 's like me , isn 't she ? Yes . If I keep your secret , will you bring Savannah back ? - I 'll do everything in my power . - So will I. [ GUN CLICKS ] [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] ELLISON : Sarah Connor ? This is James Ellison . How 'd you get this number ? A friend found it for me . Do you have her ? Just tell me if she 's safe . I need her back . Weaver 's house is wired . I 've seen the surveillance tapes . Right now , I 'm the only one that has . Let 's keep it that way . I can 't , not yet . It 's a long story . Tell it to me . Downtown , 3rd Street tunnel , one hour . - What are you doing ? - Taking you to Sarah Connor . The plan was to meet at the tunnel . The plan changed . We 'll take a left . - I 'm going to need your gun . - I don 't carry one anymore . You lied to me once before . I should have killed you then . Drive . [ CAR DOORS SLAM ] ELLISON : Where 's Savannah ? - What 's your deal with Zeira Corp ? - I work there . - Why 'd you take the girl ? - To protect her . - From who ? - One of them . - A machine was there at the house . ELLISON : What would they want ... - ... with a 6-year-old girl ? - Who knows with these things . - They may want her mother . - Why ? The girl was seeing Dr. Boyd Sherman . He worked at Zeira Corp , died at Zeira Corp. - That was an accident . - The girl 's in danger . Her mother 's in danger . You 're in danger . Give me the girl back . I 'll handle it . Listen to me . Derek 's dead . Charlie 's dead . Charlie ? Eight years ago , you would have thought I was crazy . You 'd have thrown me back in Pescadero . But you 've seen them . You know it 's true . They 're very good at what they do , and they 're not going to stop . Let me talk to Weaver . - Let me have Savannah . - She 's not safe with you . I 'm gonna have a hard time explaining that . Then let me explain it . To her . - I told you to stay out of this . - I tried . Everywhere I turn , there you are . The security footage from the house . I need to see it . I can 't access it right now . - Why not ? - The files were corrupted . A faulty sector on one of the drives . I 'm working to repair it . [ DOOR OPENS ] Savannah 's safe . - You didn 't bring her back . - Not yet . I 'm working on it . We need to talk . JOHN : Hey , you remember me , right ? Squirrel runs around the tree ? Dives in the hole , scurries out the other side . That 's right . - You taught me how to tie my shoe . - I did . At Dr. Sherman 's . He died . I know . I liked him . Me too . He was my friend . The man that got hurt at my house . Was he your friend ? Yeah , he was . I 'm sorry . Me too . It 's all my fault . That is not true . The teacher told me . Mommy told me too . Not to talk to John Henry . That if I did , bad people would come to our house and hurt us . Who 's John Henry ? He 's my friend . At my mommy 's work . What does he do there ? He lives in the basement . He lives there ? My mommy says people won 't understand . Oh . Well , I understand . I had an imaginary friend too when I was your age . He 's real . He talks . I 'm teaching him how to sing . Well , why does he live in the basement , then ? He can 't leave . There 's a cord in the back of his head . - A cord ? - In the back of his head . Do other people talk to John Henry ? Mr. Ellison . - Mr . Ellison ? - He works for my mommy . He teaches John Henry stuff . What kind of stuff ? Sarah Connor 's alive ? - Yeah , she wants to meet you . - She took my daughter . To protect her . From a machine . It might be after you . - How do you know ? - I saw the security tapes . You did ? - John Henry , I suppose . - I asked John Henry to hide them . - From me . - From everyone . Including you . I can 't say that pleases me . I think you should do what she asks . You should go meet her . - I 'm staying here . - Why ? - Someone needs to protect John Henry . - John Henry ? This is your daughter . There 's a machine out there looking for her . You need to protect her . - I 'm sorry . - You should be . What you need to understand , Mr. Ellison what I believe you 're beginning to understand is when my behavior implies I value John Henry 's survival more than that of my own daughter it is not because I love John Henry more than Savannah . It 's because I believe Savannah 's survival may someday depend upon John Henry 's survival . And because I believe that your survival may someday depend upon John Henry 's survival . I 'll meet with Sarah Connor . Make it happen . [ ELEVATOR OPENS ] [ CHATTERING ] CRAYTON : Ballistics came in on the John Doe . Funny thing is , the bullet that killed him didn 't come from the security guards . Strange . Turns out he 's a fugitive . Ex-con . Escaped custody on a felony murder charge . That 's the other funny thing . It was your case . Andrew Goode murder . - You interrogated him ? - Yes , I did . Hours before he escaped ? That 's right . Guilty ? - I never had a chance to prove it . - Because he escaped ? Only to turn up months later at the home of your employer . I know what you think . I know why you 're thinking it . I would think the same thing if I were in your shoes . I 'm not thinking anything yet , Mr. Ellison . I 'm just collecting information . [ CHATTERING ] SARAH : How 's the girl ? She 's fine . She was , uh , just telling me about her friend John Henry . The man with the cord in his head in the basement of her mother 's work . Plugged into a big computer . And this is him . Oh , it gets better . She says that Mr. Ellison has been teaching it things . I destroyed that chip . You destroyed a chip . I don 't think it 's Cromartie . I think it 's something else . Something bigger . Something worse . It 's Cyberdyne all over again . Why do they need the body ? The technology can be reverse engineered and used as a platform . Yeah , I know all that , but they 're not using it for the parts . They 're playing with it . I should 've killed him . - I 'm going to kill him . - You 're not going to kill him . - He can 't be trusted . - No one can be trusted . - But I only want to kill him . - No one 's going to be killed . No one 's going to be killed . [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] - Yes ? ELLISON : Catherine Weaver 's agreed to meet . Great . When ? Where ? You give me the girl . The police go home . When it 's clear , I 'll bring you in . - The girl can 't stay there . It 's not safe . - That 's for her mother to decide . Done . We don 't kill just to kill . I never have . Looks vicious . They stay in hiding mostly . And only attack when provoked . What does it eat ? Cuttlefish , crustaceans , other eels . Please don 't tap the glass . How long has Mr. Ellison worked for you ? A few months . Do you ever ask yourself why he didn 't stay with the FBI ? No , I don 't . Are you aware he was arrested ? - Murder . - He was cleared of those charges . Did the two of you argue lately ? Have any tension ? Any reason he might wanna harm you and your family ? Detective , are you suggesting Mr. Ellison may be complicit in the disappearance of my daughter ? Well , it wouldn 't be the first time we 've seen an employee try to blackmail their boss . Well , it would be the first time I had . This thing , it eats other eels , huh ? It 's interesting . When you told me the security tapes were corrupted you were lying to me for Mr. Ellison . And I 'm lying to him for you . What would happen if he knew ? Knew what ? That you aren 't Savannah 's mother . That you aren 't anyone 's mother . Are you threatening me , John Henry ? I could tell Mr. Ellison . You could , but that would be unfortunate . Mostly for Mr. Ellison . I find him useful but not efficient . What if he fails ? Then we won 't see Savannah again . Mr. Ellison taught me that human life is sacred . " Sacred . " That 's an interesting word . It comes from the Latin , sacrum . Much like another word , " sacrifice . " Sacrifice . Perhaps it 's necessary to sacrifice Savannah for the greater good . The greater good is keeping you safe . In the elevator , you told Mr. Ellison that Savannah 's survival depended upon my survival . Yes , I did . But you didn 't say that my survival depended upon hers . It doesn 't . Ms. Weaver ? Yes ? There is a Bible story of two brothers , Cain and Abel . God favored Abel . Cain killed him . God cursed Cain and ordered him to wander the world alone . I 'm familiar with the story . Which brother am I ? I don 't know , John Henry . Perhaps you are neither . Perhaps in this story you are God . I wanna tell you something . Yes ? It was not my idea to ditch you and Derek . I thought we were gonna meet you and then my mom took this detour off to Charlie 's . I thought you knew . She had her reasons . Yeah , she was pretty damn pissed at Derek about the whole Jesse thing . Who wasn 't ? I guess none of that matters now . You 'll miss him . Well there 's no use crying about it , is there ? I 'm sure future-me would beat my ass if I did . Future-you knows what it means to lose people you love . It happens to him too . Your mother ditched us because she was going to ditch you . She was going to leave you with Charlie . No . No , that 's insane . She found a lump in her breast . - Yeah , the transmitter . I know . - She thought it was cancer . - Well , she had a lump . It makes sense . - She 's lost weight . What ? [ FOOTSTEPS ] SARAH : Get her up . We gotta go . MAN [ ON SCREEN ] : I can 't shoot a lady . Give me the gun . Give me that gun . [ WOMAN SCREAMING ON SCREEN ] CAMERON : Think he 'll come ? He 'll come . He could be deceiving us . He 's done it before . He wants the girl . He 'll be here . And what if he doesn 't come through ? With the meeting with Weaver ? We 're going into Zeira Corp. with or without him . And when we 're done , it 'll be ashes . MAN 1 [ ON SCREEN ] : She 's wrecking the town looking for you . Come on , I gotta get you out of here . MAN 2 : If she sees me out there , she 'll kill me ! She 's crazy . MAN 1 : Come on , Mr. Archer , we gotta get out of here ! - You alone ? - Yes . Where 's Savannah ? Row J. I 'll be in touch about the meeting . CRAYTON : Put your hands behind your head . Kneel on the ground . [ GRUNTING ] ELLISON : John , I swear I didn 't know . JOHN : I 'll kill you . Let go of me . I 'll kill you . I 'll kill you . [ SINGING " DONALD , WHERE 'S YOUR TROUSERS " ] [ BOTH SINGING ] [ ENGLISH SDH ]

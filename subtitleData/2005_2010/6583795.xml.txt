 You 're drawing that picture again , aren 't you ? ! Stop ! If you don 't stop , you 'll be put in a bag and taken away ! God is dead . Arai Tsukiko Tsukiko , are you in the middle of work ? Can 't you tell by looking ? Then it can 't be helped . " I 'll go back to my job ! " Oh my God ! Happy Birthday To You ... What the hell ? ! We got her good ! Shut up . Shut up ! Shut up ! God ! Sorry ... Arai ... You 're down 25 % . Want to change shifts ? Want to receive ' digital counselling ' ? Sorry . I 'll do my best . Get it together ! What ? What 's wrong ? Is there something I can do to help ? I 'm fine . There 's an egg with a crack in it ? Yes . Something that looked like whiskers . Like ... some kind of whiskers ? Yeah , something like whiskers . - Whiskers , huh ? - Yes . I don 't know why , but it makes me feel pleasure and pain ... Pleasure and pain , huh ? But I can see it very clearly . I 'm not crazy or anything . The human brain is mysterious . Page 190 . You can see the triangle , right ? Yes . But there 's no triangle drawn here . - Isn 't that correct ? - Yes . This is called " Cancer 's Triangle " . The human brain works by association . For example : I say " Cancer " ... but you think " Crab " . There isn 't actually any equilateral triangle drawn at all , however , can 't you clearly see the equilateral triangle ? The brain makes a judgment about what you haven 't experienced and shows it to you . Doesn 't seeing things mean that you 're seeing images produced by the brain ? So , seeing what isn 't really there is what we call a hallucination . It 's probably something from your childhood . The egg you see in your mind is likely an abstract reflection of something else . But it 's a little different from that . I can see it extremely clearly , almost like it 's really there . And it changed a little bit . I think humans fundamentally fear the darkness of the night . Think back to when you were a child , afraid of the dark . How scared you were of the sound of rain , or animals ... Not that I 'm afraid ! But , that 's not the point ... It 's almost as if ... almost as if there was a creepy jungle outside the window . You just know it 's out there ! But there 's nothing . After a period of years , they stop hearing anything . But isn 't that becoming an adult ? " An adult " ? Which means you 're still not ... Arai ... Arai , you 're still like a little kid , psychologically . Excuse me . Don 't worry . You can 't change it physically . I 'm sorry , but probably , something happened in your past that 's causing you to see it . But it 's nothing to fear , because it 's a false image . [ Kyozo : An unclear sounding word in Japanese which could mean a lot of things , depending on what kanji it 's written with ] " A false image " ? Not a huge elephant ! " Tsukiko , Happy Birthday " ! Happy birthday ! Present ! " Oh , wow - this is Korean barbecue ! " Eat ! Eat ! Hey , eat ! Tsukiko ! Cheer up ! Are you okay , Tsukiko ? I 'm okay . Why are you closing your eyes ? Are you not feeling well ? It 's nothing . It doesn 't look that way . Do you feel something ? I said , it 's nothing ! If there 's something troubling you , don 't hesitate to tell me . Thanks . What ? ! What the hell ! Hello ? - Uuji , help me ! - What ? What 's wrong ? Hurry . Hurry . Come . Hello ? Hello ? It 's not a false image ! It 's not a false image ! It 's real ! Stop ! Get away from me ! Get away from me ! Officer ! Help ! - What 's wrong ? - Help ! No ... it 's nothing . What 's that ? It 's fine . What seems to be the problem ? Are you being pursued by someone ? Huh ? I 'm okay . I 'm okay . You 're okay ? Right ... What is it ? ! This area . This area ! " This area " ? Shoot , please ! What ? ! What are you doing ? I said , please shoot ! You 've done too many stimulants ! It 's coming ... It 's coming ! Come with me ! You 're mistaken ! Hurry up and come . Damn ! You 're mistaken ! And then ? It 's like I told you . When you close your eyes , you 're attacked by a strange creature ? It 's not really a monster , it 's like an animal that lives in my eyes . So , what 's that weird thing doing now ? Is it still attacking you ? It 's not there now . Where did it go ? Is it sleeping ? Perhaps it is . What 's so funny ? You 're a typical drug-addict . Where did you buy it ? Huh ? - Enough crazy stories ... Get real ! - You 're mistaken . From the Yakuza ? Online ? In front of a station ? - I said , you 're mistaken ! - I 'm not mistaken ! You 're on drugs . How long have you been doing them ? Huh ? You have a pretty face , that doesn 't help us ... all the more reason why I can 't forgive this . We have to wipe out hard-to-figure-out criminals like you ! Act like a drug addict , drug addict . Running around with red eyes . Saying crazy stuff like , " needles are attacking me " ! Make it easier to figure out ! The pretty girls like you spur more crime . It goes something like , " Oh , hey , hey , look at this pretty girl doing it , maybe I should do it too . " Besides , I want to get a little bit skinnier . " What are you saying ? If that 's what you want , then I 'll hook you up . I 'll introduce you to someone I know . It 's absolutely unforgivable ! - Takumaro , throw her in jail ! - Yes . You 're mistaken . That 's not it . Even if I explain it , I don 't think you 'll understand , but ... it might just be me . Since I was a kid ... It 's been there ? Yes , and it hatched yesterday . But it was an egg ? It was an egg . Hey , hey , hey . Stay overnight for now . By tomorrow , the junk will be out of your system . No ! I 've never done drugs . Yeah , yeah . I understand . Wait ! Oh , oh , look at her go wild ! Yeah , she 's not on drugs ! We 'll save you ! Now those are some good criminals ... A creature living in your optic nerve ? Tsukiko 's retina has become the entrance to a parallel world . Why is that ? Hey , Hey . Look . Look at this . This incident ... A record of an incident from 1930 . " The defendant was raised in Russian Georgia . " 1923 : " She sought asylum in Kobe , taking along her Korean husband , eldest son , and eldest daughter . " 1930 : " The defendant shot her eldest daughter , who was 10 at the time , " to death with a hunting gun that was in the home . " She voluntarily went to Hyogo Prefecture Sannomiya Police Station . " After being arrested she was questioned , but like an idiot , she gave a nonsensical testimony . " For generations , from early childhood , only the women of the defendant 's lineage ... " could see an egg when they closed their eyes . " After around 20 years , the egg hatches , " and an ugly monster is born . " The monster that lives parasitically through the retina world , gradually acts more and more violently , " injuring the body from within . And nobody can understand that pain . " At night , the monster persistently repeated its attacks , but no doctor could understand it . " All they did was give her a vulnerary . " They concluded that it must be mental illness and delusions . " The woman suffered , but when she visited the zoo in the daytime , during which the monster was dormant , " she came to realize something . Perhaps the monster 's attacks weren 't attacks , after all ? " The attachment behavior seen in the babies of people , monkeys , etc . , right after birth : " Clinging , confirming one 's existence through physical contact , instinctive behavior . " However , the pain was hard to endure , and she figured it might go away ... " if she couldn 't see with her eyes , so she destroyed them both herself . " Doing so made the monster disappear . " However , it wasn 't just her own problem . " When her own daughter started showing the signs , the woman got the gun . " The defendant hung herself in the prison of Sannomiya Police station , and died . " What was the name of the mother ? Let me see ... " Eca ... " - Gerashuviri ? - Right . No way ? This has gotta be a lie ! My blood ... It can 't be - it 's the 21st century ! Anyways , aren 't you Korean ? Why Georgia ? Where the hell is Georgia ? I heard this when I was a kid . My grandparents were in Russia during the revolution . The married couple were Georgian and Korean . They fled from Georgia , because they loathed Stalin . They finally escaped to Korea , and hid from their enemies . So my mother always thought she was Korean . I was educated about Korea ever since I was a kid . Eca Gerashuviri is my great-grandmother , who fled from Georgia . What 's wrong ? I 'm ... Oh no ! Stay back ! Stay back ! Stay back ! No ! Stay back ! It hurts ! Stop ! Dumbass ! It 's dangerous ! What are you doing in the middle of the road ? Huh ? Did I ... hit you ? Did I ? What are you doing ? Don 't fuck around ! " While it was inactive during the daytime ... " It 's light ! Don 't give me any trouble ! What the fuck are you doing ? Give it back . Wow ! You 're covered in blood ! Did someone hit you ? Yo , bro ! Ambulance ! Arai ! Great ! What ? What the hell ? " Perhaps the monster 's attacks weren 't attacks , after all ? " " The egg was her own offspring , which her retina had given birth to . " You ... Making fires . You realized something good . Why do I understand your words ? That 's because of your blood , which is ours . My blood ? I lost both my eyes and eliminated that child . But I couldn 't sever the bloodline . Because that 's what that child wanted . " That child " ? We are hosts . " We are hosts " ? It 's ugly , but ... it 's lovely ... But ... Surely , something can be done . You are ... my ... Love it . I ... Or else , give it death ... Fine ... Come here . Receive my affection . I ... You ... Good bye ! " Sashimi , tempura , yakisoba , udon ! " What time will it be ? I don 't know . I 'll call you later . Arai ... Sorry . After that , Tsukiko never dared to shut her one remaining eye . Translation : Brolen for kemushi Timing : Lordretsudo

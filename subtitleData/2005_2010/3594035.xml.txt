 Previously on V. My name is Anna , and I am the leader of my people . They 're calling themselves " the visitors " . - You watching ? - Yeah , I 'm watching . You all seem to be what we consider attractive . You 're not so bad yourself . Whenever Anna has something significant to say , we would like her to say it through you . They knew we were coming . Someone tipped them off . We need your help . I 'm nor gonna put my fiancee at risk . Welcome to the New York mother ship . Have you heard about our new peace ambassador program ? You two are obsessed with visitors . They call it spreading hope . Take this and go to this address . All the information 's inside . The visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . They 'll take over unless we can stop them . You were right to fight . There 's others out there like me . We 'll help . They have a big head start . They 're arming themselves with the most powerful weapon out there . - What big weapon ? - Devotion . I don 't know who to trust anymore . I can 't get the image of Dale just lying there out of my head . What do we do now ? We help build a resistance . We recruit . We have to be careful . We 'll be careful . Are we the only ones who got away ? No , there were others . - What 's going on ? - It 's going to the warehouse . What are they doing ? They 're cleaning up . What ? We have to do something . No . It has to be anonymous . 9-1-1 . What 's your emergency ? Oh , my god . It 's a massacre . Please . Please , they 're killing people . You have to come . Okay , slow down , ma 'am . Where are you ? It 's a warehouse 4400 Pier Avenue , Brooklyn . Please send the police . Let 's go . We 're sitting ducks out here . Come on . I 'm contacting dispatch now . How many people were killed ? I don 't know , a lot . Look , just send everyone that you 've got . Okay , ma 'am , don 't hang up . I need to confirm that address with you again . - You 're at 4400 Pier Avenue ? - Yes . How many times do I have to tell you ? I 'm gonna stay with you on the line until help arrives . What 's your name , ma 'am ? Ma 'am ? Hang up ! Hang up ! They must 've seen us . No . They intercepted the call . - What ? - The visitors- - they traced the call . How is that possible ? How is any of this possible ? Dale was my partner . He was one of ' em . He 's been my partner for seven years , long before the ships showed up . Anyone could be a visitor . Jack , go home . What ? Go home . Act normal . Pretend this never happened . Wait , we can 't just walk away from this . We can 't attack it head-on , either . It 's too dangerous . I have to figure out what to do . Go home . Don 't trust anyone . Anyone Tyler ? - God ! - Whoa ! Ty . Tyler . I thought you were ... - Where have you been ? - With--with Brandon . All night ? Y-yeah . - My bike broke down . Uh ... - Okay . Are you sure you 're okay ? Ty , I need to talk to you about yesterday . It is really important to me that you don 't get involved with the visitors . I know they 're exciting and kinda cool , but ... For me , can you do that ? Yeah . O-okay . You 're just saying that . Promise . Yeah . I mean , if it--if it 's that big of a deal to you , um ... No more visitor stuff . You know , I ... I promise . Good . I need you to be safe . - I-I am . - Okay . - Can--can I go to bed now ? - Yeah . I love you , Ty . After three weeks of evaluation , a decision on whether the U.S. will establish diplomatic ties with the visitors may come as early as today . The decision will be based in large part on a recommendation from the Visitor Threat Assessment Joint Task Force . Establishing relations would grant the visitors full freedom of movement within our nation 's borders . There 's been much debate over the last few weeks as to ... Establishing ties with the visitors Is a good thing , Jack . More souls to save . You 'll see . ... Though high ranking visitors have been granted limited ... Oh , the police came by last night . They wanted to talk to you About that poor man who was stabbed to death yesterday . Said they 'd be back this morning . You left your gun in my car . Evans . Erica , it 's Paul . Have you seen Dale ? Dale ? No . Not since yesterday . Why ? I need you to get in here . He 's missing . Okay . Last night was great . Better than great . You know , maybe I should hide rings all over the house . How 's your arm ? You think I 'm gonna let some scratch from a filing cabinet get the best of me ? Oh , hey , hon , there 's some , uh , ointment in the medicine chest if you need it . Thanks , baby , But it 's not that bad . And please feel free to ask anything and everything . I 'm here to discuss all topics without reserve . And please feel free to ask anything and everything . I 'm here to discuss all topics without reserve . Morning . You 're early . Yeah . Just watching the interview . Why are you beating yourself up over this ? Because my dad 's not here do it for me ? Chad , if you 'd gone after Anna on the air , you 'd never get access again . 80 million viewers watched you last night . 80 million watched Anna . No formal response yet from India . Be pient . The U.S. is the lynchpin . Once they grant us freedom , the remaining countries will follow . I 'm told in japan , This conveys both a respect for tradition and the allure of submission . I 'm not sure that 's the message you want to send . You still don 't understand humanity . V Season 1 Episode 02 Erica . We 're ready for ya . His wife 's pretty upset . She 's been here a couple hours . Dale never made it home last night . She says he always calls , even on stakeout . Timing 's terrible . Half my team 's been reassigned to this Visitor Task Force . Paul , I don 't really care about the visitors right now . We 're all worried about Dale . Any agent goes missing , it 's a big deal . You wanna ask me anything before we go in ? It 's just a few questions , right ? Agent Evans , please have a seat . Father Jack Landry ? - Yeah . - I 'm special agent Sarita Malik with the FBI Visitor Threat Assessment Joint Task Force . That 's a mouthful . Can I as you some questions about the man who died here yesterday ? I understand you were the last person to talk to him . I was expecting the police , not the , uh , FBI . The victim was on a bureau list . He made dozens of calls to us over the years About a supposed alien invasion . Remember when that was crazy talk ? There 's still plenty of crazy out there . We 've logged thousands of calls like his over the years . It 's just now we have to pay attention to them . Makes sense . We really appreciate your help , agent Evans . No , of course . Where do you want to start ? The last time you saw agent Maddox was ... Around 9 o 'clock last night We grabbed some dinner , then he dropped me off . His wife said the two of you were working together last night . Well , that 's true . Then we grabbed dinner , then he dropped me off . Had you ever seen him before yesterday ? I don 't think so . You sure ? Yeah . No , I-I don 't think not- - not , uh , not before yesterday . Were you aware of any , uh , marital problems ? No . He loves Joselyn . Any drug or alcohol issues ? No . Dale doesn 't even drink . So he didn 't come here to see you ? Well , people come to see priests all the time . I 'm a--I 'm a priest , so ... Did he say anything about the visitors ? Take this and go to this address and give it to the people there . Ah , yeah , he just ... he just seemed very- - he seemed really scared . Stressed out ? Who isn 't ? There 's a spaceship above our city . He 's been my partner for seven years . He 's always had my back . Were the two of you romantically involved ? Sorry , we have to ask . Dale 's like a brother to me , so no . How much more of this do we have ? Dale 's missing . I 'd like to be out there looking for him . Yeah , agent Evans , I have a few more questions . Agent Evans ? Paul ? What 's going on ? They found Dale 's car . - What ? - That address . Mean something to you ? Yeah , it came up in an investigation into a terrorist cell . Maybe Dale was looking into it . And you didn 't think to tell me this ? All right , people , nobody in or out until we get the all clear . There 's possible suspects in there . Get on the radios . Stay on the radios . If we need backup , we 'll call N.Y.P.D. Nobody gets hurt . Everybody stays aware . Right ? Come on , where are you ? Find anything ? Dale 's phone . To the people of Japan , we say thank you again for establishing diplomatic ties with us . And to the people of the great country of Mexico we say thank you as well . And we wait with great anticipation for Russia , India and the United States - to follow their lead . - Really ? Hopefully , a decision is forthcoming . Until then , we are of peace always . Poll numbers . Country 's split about the visitors . 50 % are still undecided . Yeah , people don 't have enough info . That 's my fault . I didn 't ask Anna the hard questions . I got played . - Chad , we talked about this . - No , I know , But I need to show Anna she 's not the only one who can get what she wants . You gonna call her for another interview ? I don 't need Anna . When I 'm done , she 'll be the one calling me . What 's this ? I want you to give me this ring in your own time , when you 're ready . I 'm still mad at myself for not trusting you . Yeah , well , I was sneaking around ... buying you this engagement ring . Like I said , give it to me in your own time . I had a client cancel today . Wanna meet for lunch ? I wish I could , sweetheart , but I have to go out to Jersey for a meeting . Rain check ? Okay . I still can 't believe you joined up last night . Dude , you 've got some serious brass clankers . Now just , uh , keep it down around my mom . What , about--about the brass clankers ? No , dumb-ass . About me joining . My mom- - she doesn 't get it , man . She 'd totally freak . Yeah , well , mine , too . Must be a parent thing . Ahem . I mean , seriously , who doesn 't wanna hang out with someone from another planet ? Yeah , I know , right ? - Tyler . - Hey , Lisa . That jacket looks really good on you . Thanks . I remember you . Uh , Brandon , right ? Yeah . Tyler told me you wanted to become a peace ambassador . The thought crossed my mind . Come on . Let 's see if we can get you to the front of the line . This way . Oh.Two words man- - awe . Some . Is everything all right ? I 'm not sure I did the right thing , father . The man who died--he was ranting about the visitors . I should 've mentioned that . That poor soul was clearly disturbed . Didn 't the FBI agent say as much ? She wasn 't just with the FBI . She was ... with the VisitorThreat Assessment Joint Task Force . Tread carefully , jack . There are sensitive talks going on between our government and the visitors . You wouldn 't want to upset the applecart now , would ya ? I 'm sure you 're doing the right thing . You never answered my question before . Why this the first time I 'm hearing about this warehouse ? We were afraid there was a mole . Someone kept tipping off the cells we were tracking . I guess dale came here to investigate . Why would he do that alone ? Didn 't he trust you ? You know , I 've kind of had enough , sir ... The questions , the tone . My partner--my friend ... could be out there somewhere . Then go find him . Canvass the area ! Get in touch with justice , D.E.A. , A.T.F. Do we know if any of these people are from the first attempt at a resistance ? Not yet , but we 'll get the information from him . I want answers . Who else was with you in the warehouse ? Give me the names , and I 'll make the snakes go away . I don 't know . I never saw them before . Make it s-stop ! He was the only human we captured alive . A new resistance would be unacceptable . I want names . Hello ? Hello ? Excuse me . I 'm looking for Angelo . Don 't know any Angelo . Angelo Russo . Never heard of him . I told you never come back . Yeah , I missed you , too , Angelo . Jack ? What are you doing here ? I work here . You 're an FBI agent ? You 're a freakin ' priest ? Father Landry ? We 're ready for you . What are you doing here ? Upsetting the applecart . You two know each other ? - No . - Yes . We just met . Father ? Malik . What 's the priest doing here ? He 's got info on a murder . We won 't join you . And that 's--that 's my bike . And that 's , uh , that 's my bike in tompkins park . And , uh , that 's--that 's me and my bike . You real like your bike . Well , that 's Verducci 's pizza . That 's the best slice in the city . Y-you ever had pizza ? Well , you 're gonna love it . Look , I 'll take you there as soon as they let you out . What makes you think I 'd go anywhere with you ? You space girls are funny . You were joking , right ? Can I see that ? Did I do it right ? Perfect . Oh , whoops ! What ? What are you gonna do about it , V boy ? Huh ? Hey , what 's wrong with you , man ? Huh ? What are you gonna do about it , V lover ? - Wait , Tyler . - Hey , you got a problem , man ? You 're the one with the problem . Your boy 's littering . Man , let 's just forget about this Ty , okay ? You always make your girlfriend do the talkin ' ? Ohh ! Come on ! Hey , the peace ambassador just punched a guy ! Okay . Okay , okay , okay . Okay ! Okay ! Aw . Aw , dude , you got a little somethin ' right there . Lisa ! Heard something about a fight at a warehouse in brooklyn last night . Little bird told you ? I keep my ear to the ground . How do you think I stayed alive this long ? Can 't believe you 're involved in that again . You should be hiding . I was . Then I got a phone call . Remember Georgie ? Yeah , I remember him . Guy 's a hothead . He 'll get you killed . Maybe , but I can 't walk away . Looked up in the sky lately ? - Wasn 't suppose to happen yet . - But it has . And whatever they 're gonna do to the humans , it 's nothing compared to what they 'll do to traitors like me and you . Take my advice ... Head for the hills . I can 't . There 's a woman . Human . Oh , god . Don 't tell me you 're in love with her . You know anybody looking to get back into the fight ? That 's really why you came , isn 't it ? Just give me some names . I know there 's some others . I 'm sorry , Ryan . I can 't trust you . I can 't trust anyone . This way , Father . You gave them the pictures . What the hell were you thinking ? I wanted to do the right thing . Oh , the right thing ? Stick to preaching . A man died giving me those pictures . I gave them to the task force 'cause I thought they could help . They 're supposed to be on our side , aren 't they ? So was my partner . Look where that got us . What if those photos can stop the government from getting into bed with the visitors ? What part of " don 't trust anyone " did you not understand ? You walked away from me last night . What the hell was I supposed to do ? Don 't trust anyone ? You got it . Evans . My office , now . Sit down . I just keep wondering why Dale would go into that warehouse all by himself . Me , too . Any idea why your case notes and his aren 't matching up ? What are you talking about ? I want you to tell me why you 're lying about last night . I 'm not lying . Really ? Oh , my gosh . It 's a massacre . They 're killing people . You have to come . Okay , slow down , madam . Where are you ? It 's a-a warehouse ... 4400 Pier Avenue , Brooklyn . Please send the police . I 'm contacting dispatch now . How many people were killed ? I don 't know . It 's a lot . Tell me that 's not you . I was at the warehouse . I made the call . You lied to me . You could have compromised this entire investigation . Erica , explain this to me or ... I think that Dale is working with one of the terrorist groups we were investigating . - You 're telling me Dale 's a traitor ? - Well , I couldn 't accuse him without hard evidence , so I followed him to the warehouse . I saw him meet with them . And you never called for backup ? Well , if I was wrong , I could have blown a legitimate investigation . So I called 9-1-1 . If Dale needed help , he would get it , if he didn 't , I would get backup . But it didn 't work . - They never showed . - No . No , they never showed , because the emergency call center has no record of your 9-1-1 . Paul , you just played it for me . I got this recording from D.E.A. They have every pay phone around that warehouse tapped . It 's part of a smuggling crackdown , and it 's the only reason I even half believe you right now . If they 're tampering with 9-1-1 calls , then this goes deeper than I thought . You know how all this sounds ? Awesome and airtight ? Dale is a traitor . Paul , I don 't like it any more than you do . But I 'll prove it . I just need some time . Okay . I just hope to hear you 're wrong . Good afternoon . I 'm Chad Decker . Today " Prime Focus " takes a look at the question that 's on everyone 's minds . Do the visitors deserve our trust ? Are they the saviors they 'd have us believe , or are we in danger of rushing to a premature judgment ? Joining me in the discussion are congressman Harold Stern , a pro-V advocate , and Marion Geiger taking the anti-V position . Marion , let 's start with you . Why exactly don 't you trust the V 's ? Jack . Look ... I 'm sorry . I can 't stop thinking about what you said- - that I walked away from you . I 'm kinda busy . I know . But you were trying to do the right thing . If you 're trying to apologize , fine . You 're forgiven . Excuse me . I just keep thinking about all of these years , all of the people that Dale fooled ... Not just me , his friends , our friends , his wife . He had a wife ? Do you think she 's a visitor , too ? I don 't know . They lived together , slept together . She saw him at his most vulnerable . Even if she 's not , she might know something that can help us . " Us " ? Us ? No , no , no , no . I 'm ... I 'm done . I 'm taking your advice . Remember what you said ? You said , " go home . Act normal . " There is no normal anymore . I need your help . Erica , you 're an FBI agent . I am just ... I don 't know . You 're the only person I can trust . I 'm sorry . No . If I 'm gonna do any good , it is here . Joselyn , we checked Dale 's phone records . We couldn 't find any calls to you . He had a personal phone . Said he wanted to keep work and family separate . I , uh , I came across these a few months ago . All of these calls- - they 're to two numbers ? Yes . That one 's mine , And , uh ... He called that other one a lot . Have you noticed anything ? Has Dale been acting odd lately ? You know my husband . He gets lost in work sometimes . He can be distant . Did the visitors ' arrival have anything to do with it ? Maybe . Everyone 's life has changed in some way since they got here- - All the excitement . All of Dale 's calls went to the same trunk line , - dead end by design . - Untracble . There is something we can trace- - the pattern of the calls . Every time we went to nail this terrorist cell , Dale would make a tip-off call to the same number , 20 , 30 minutes before . I ran it all down , number by number , case by case . I just can 't believe Dale crawled to the other side . You can 't believe it ? Seven years , joined at the hip . Well , the scary thing is he 's still in the wind . I don 't think he 'll show his face again . Val ? Val ? Hello ? Ryan ? Angelo ? What 's with the drugs , man ? I told you . I can 't trust anyone . I had to check you out . Yeah . And ? If you really care about this woman , you 'll get as far away from her as possible . Yeah , well , that 's not gonna happen , okay ? If I stay with her , I can protect her , so I 'm not going anywhere . You sure about that ? Yeah , 100 % . Valerie Stevens- - psychotherapist , works at Graden medical- - 598 east 35th street . She grew up in Detroit , father was an autoworker , mother a homemaker . She graduated N.Y.U. She has a heart condition . Did you do something to her ? No . I wouldn 't touch her . But they will , if they find her , and if I can do it , so can they . You say you really love her ? You real want to put her in the cross fire ? Lisa . They won 't let me in . I know . The counsel wants to kick you out of the ambassador program . What ? Your country is nervous about us as it is . If you 're gonna wear that jacket- - Listen , listen , I 'll--tell me what to do , and I-I 'll do it . I 'm already in trouble . I 'm the one that recommended you . It 's up to the counsel now . Good-bye , Tyler . This was nothing less than a complete abrogation of our agreement . Abrogation ? Nice . You have one of those word-a-day calendars ? We 'll be looking for a journalist who knows better than to bite the hand that feeds him . Mr. Decker . Anna . I didn 't hurt you with my show today . I helped . The public trusts me . Go back and watch the tape . Sure , there were pros and cons , but in the end , I made people feel comfortable with the idea of embracing diplomatic relations . You really believe that . Check the insta-polls . You got a nice uptick right after my show . And you did that because you have our best interests at heart ? I can 't control what our government does , but I can and do influence public opinion , and in the end , that 's what 'll make the difference . I did this to help you , and it 's working . Are you done preening , Mr. Decker ? Not quite . This one was a freebie . The next time you want my help , it 'll be on my terms . After weeks of investigation , the state department announced moments ago the united states and the visitors have agreed to the commencement of diplomatic relations . As a first step , a limited number of visitors will be able to apply for visas that will allow them to travel freely within our borders . We are going to take you now to the visitor mother ship over manhattan , where the V high commander Anna is addressing the crowds below . On behalf of all visitors , I want to extend my warmest appreciation to the united states . We are humbled by the generous faith , the courage and the good will you 've demonstrated . Thank you for your trust . It will be rewarded . We are of peace always . It 's a great blessing . Hello ? I just wanted to thank you . You 're welcome . And listen , maybe ... You undercover , Father ? Just off duty . Do you want to walk with me ? Erica , when I heard the announcement about the visitors , it made me feel ... Sick to your stomach ? Yeah , me , too . You know we can 't win this war picking them off one at a time . " We " ? I-I didn 't know that you reenlisted . This afternoon I was afraid of what I might have to do if I got involved . But after the announcement , the only thing that scares the hell out of me now is doing nothing . That 's the second time I 've heard you curse . Must be hanging out with the wrong kind of people . Diplomatic relations with the visitors isn 't gonna make our job any easier . Neither is the fact that the V task force ignored the pictures I gave ' em . Oh , there are probably visitors on the V Task Force . They could be anywhere . At least we have this . What 's that ? I swiped it from the V task force- - Anyone and everyone who 's ever contacted the FBI about aliens or visitors . Maybe we can find other people who want to fight , maybe even some of the people from the warehouse . We can 't be the only ones who know the truth . Say what you want about the visitors , but the therapy business is booming . Can I look at your arm ? Yeah . Oh , it 's not so bad . Yeah . See ? I told you . It 's almost healed . That 's weird . Did you do that ? The picture 's upside down . Who 's Cyrus ? Some guy I used to know . Guy you used to know ? Yes . Some guy ... I used .. to know . Yeah ? Come in . Ty , thanks for keeping your promise about the V 's . Don 't stay up too late , even if it is for school .

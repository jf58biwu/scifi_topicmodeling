 ♪ Accordion What do you think , kids ? Isn 't it beautiful ? Where do you think the clinic is ? That 's where 2 will be . - Who are you people ? - Newcomers . So ... where have you come from ? - We just got offthe bus . - But where did you get on the bus ? Well , the Village . No , this is the Village - you 've arrived here . Well , isn 't thatjust the wildest thing ? ( Chuckles ) Ah , sir , your car is waiting . Mr Curtis is expecting you in 44 minutes . Your car is right outside . In ... 43 minutes . ( Hammering ) ( Bicycle bell ) ( Groans ) They 're building houses , bussing people in . That has to mean something . - Yeah . More Village . Be still , please . - What is this , anyway ? - Your name was on the test list . - The Village is all there is . And now there are newcomers . How can they say that 's possible ? You 're right . I say it as though it were something ordinary . We all say it . " More Village . " - ( Groans ) - Oh , er ... What is it ? ( Applause and rousing orchestral music ) Aren 't they splendid ? Isn 't this just the most wonderful thing ? They 're buildings , houses . 1 1-12 , you could not be more profoundly wrong . - ( Music blaring ) - " More Village " means that our way of life is becoming the very consciousness ofthe universe . I exaggerate , of course , but only slightly . Oh , indulge me . Take it all in . ( Inhales and exhales deeply ) This moment will be handed down through generations of our family . ( Chuckles ) There will be generations of our family , won 't there , 1 1-12 ? Yes . I suppose . ( Laughing ) Oh , dear ! Oh , dear , 1 1-12 . You 're so ... earnest . Take a tip from your old man . Unbutton yourself . Enjoy life . Dance the night away with some darling girl . ( Laughing ) What is this ? Is it perhaps your certificate of dying ? Why now ? You could have killed me a thousand times . I 've tried every way I know to help you to belong , but still you refuse . You choose . This life ... or no life . Assimilate or die ? That is the great gift of Village death . Clarity of choice . Oh , 2 , it 's you ! 2 in person ! I ... I would ask for your autograph , but I don 't have a pen . ( Chuckles ) ( Both laughing ) There are people here , 6 . Good people . Newcomers . Look at them . Hi ! They choose life . - But you ... - I 'll find a way out before I die . ( Coughing ) Oh , 6 ... Let me give you the very secret of life . Breathe in ... ( Coughs ) Breathe out . ( Coughing ) More ... Village . ( Coughing ) I shall watch you die ... one breath at a time , 6 . One ... .. tick ofthe clock at a time . ( Clicks tongue ) I said , " Don 't look at me . " 2 : Pity about poor old 6 . How does that make you feel , 313 ? Be honest . - If you can 't confide in 2 , who can you ? - I wish you ... .. would help him . There 's something inside 6 that refuses to be unlocked . And perhaps the prospect of death will unlock him . Death unlocks us all . And still he clings to his abstinence . Freedom . Such touching faiths - one envies him , almost . But you and I know better . ( Sobbing ) We have measured the cost - wouldn 't you say ? Don 't look . 2 : Or am I wide ofthe mark ? - No . - Don 't let her rule you . - Shut up . - Lock her out . Do you hear ? - Lock her out . - I can 't . Put it on your head . - The things she showed me . The other ... - The other place ? It 's in my head now , though . I can 'tjust rub it out . - Can 't or won 't ? - Shut up ! Shut up . 2 : A little self control is all that is required ... .. for 6 's sake . 6 : You still come here ? What do you want from me , 6 ? To kill someone you love because you love them ... The Village does that to you . Don 't you have to wonder what kinda place it is ? ( 6 coughing ) I know you don 't want to yet ... .. but the time is coming ... .. when you 'll wanna tell me ... to give me the information ... .. to get us all outta here . To get you outta here . ( Coughing ) Does your mother care for you , 6 ? Mine does . I believe she does . Only a mother can destroy every ounce of hope in you . ( Car horns blaring ) ( Coughing ) ( Bell chiming and heart beating ) ( Groaning and coughing ) So , what are you gonna do ? Are you gonna let them do this to you ? - ( Coughing ) - Listen to me . I met someone who might be able to help you . Now , this guy ... this guy is deep . ( Coughing ) This guy 's got cures . - Hey . - 147 . I make it ten till , which gives us 24 minutes to get across to Mr Curtis , and we don 't wanna be late . People usually like to be early for Mr Curtis . ( Coughing ) Hey , you like to ride ? Cos I like to ride . ( Chuckles ) Man ! Time was , I was so crazy , I thought every single car on the street was out to get me , and I just had to get ' em first . Now , I just wanted to hurt somebody . ( Chuckles ) - And now ? - Now ? Now I 'm a baby . ( Chuckles ) Now I 'm seeing the world through fresh eyes . It 's like my brain has had a wash . Like ... a spring-clean ofthe frontal lobe . You know what I mean ? 147 : This way . ( Muttering softly in own language ) What is this ? Something 's coming . Do you feel it ? And all we have to do is wait . ( Muttering ) No . Can 't you see that 's crazy ? Waiting is giving up . They keep us here ... to control our minds up there . You are there now , driving a car . Right now , driving me . Man ... I mean , look at this . It 's my little girl . I mean , this is an old one , but er ... Ain 't she something ? Huh ? And Mr Curtis has had a word with the judge , and he says , if I keep making progress , they 're gonna let me see her again . Mr Curtis ain 't nothing but a kind man . He 's a great man . No , that 's the most insanest thing I 've ever heard . - We gotta get ourselves outta here . Come on . - Right now you 're dying . And everyone knows dead men don 't have no hope . - What does this great man want with me ? - ( Laughs ) I 'm just a driver , man . I don 't know his plans . But I will tell you this . He will have some kind of plan for you . I 'll be seeing you . Been celebrating , 1 1-12 ? I 'm not 1 1-12 . I 'm only 2 's son . That 's all I 'll ever be to anybody . 313 told me about the pills . Is your mother dying ? I thought ... one day ... .. maybe one day , she would come back . One day . ( Sniffling ) Come with us . Leave . Leave your father . Leave all ofthis . 1 1-12 : The Village is best for me . I live here . This place is all I 've got . Besides ... I 've got stuffto do - only , I 'm not nearly drunk enough yet . I 'd like to get on with finishing the job . ( 6 coughing ) WOMAN : I think ... think that 's for me . I live here . This place is all I 've got . ( Whispering ) All I 've got . I ... I ... Because I live here ... .. this place , it 's ... .. it 's all I 've ... all I 've got . I don 't think so . Michael . How are you ? Dear , look - it 's Michael . From Summakor . My wife Helen . Helen is a biochemist . She studies the mind , the depths ofthe mind . We all commonly accept the existence ofthe unconscious . Helen surmised that , ifthere are two layers of consciousness , then why not more ? And ifthere are more , where are they and what are they ? What ifwe could go there ? What ifwe could take with us all these broken people ... .. and let them fix themselves ? Nothing too clever . Just the simple virtues in life . Dignity of labour , civic pride , family . Sufficient to rekindle their lost purpose back here on terra firma . Your driver ... - He was one ofthese people . - Well , yes . And hundreds more like him . ( Chuckles ) Michael , you found them . - Your work in Summakor . - Spying on people . No . Protecting them . Repairing them . We all need that . Helen was the first person ever in the Village . All those remarkable dreams . Every thought , every impulse within the Village resides here in her mind . No children of our own - her great heartbreak . And we thought ... we wondered ... if it were possible , ifwe went there , that we could have a family . ( Gasps ) ( Groans ) What goes on in that head ? Of course , this was not the plan . Still ... Not long now . He 's here . 2 : Look at the clock at the time . ( Heart beating ) Small ... .. or large ? Oh , I shall miss you . Rest assured , you will not go quietly . Horse-drawn carriage , and the Village choir serenading you to your final resting place . No excuse for dry eyes - I 'll see to that .

Want it all to stop . The madness ofthis world to stop . Most days ... .. I don 't know why I live . I don 't know why I breathe . I go on . I drive .

My son 's death ... I can only bear it if it gives me clarity . - I had a dream last night . - A dream ? I dreamed ... clarity . All of it . Suppose your child 's death gives you a place in Village history . Gave you , 147 , the moral courage to act when the moment comes . To think what is unthinkable , to do what cannot be done . You like 6 , don 't you ? Trust him ? Yes , he 's someone who can give us better Village , moral Village , freedom within the prison . And when the moment comes , you will stand beside 6 ... .. and you will call out that " 6 ... is the 1 . " The 1 ? The 1 . 2 : Look . Over there . Dark suit , grey hair . Do you see ? - Sure . - Well , that man ... the things he 's seen ! He was an army veteran , stationed out in the Middle East , who blew up a village school . Now look . New wife , new life , new suit . 2 : What a difference . See that woman ? She was ruined by one street drug after another , and look at her now . Let me tell you - that woman ... I see . I 'm wasting my breath . Nobody signed up for this . None ofthese people asked to be fixed . You mean , we should seek their permission ? I 'm human . I have a thousand flaws . I break down . I get up . I don 't get up . I get lost . I make the same mistakes over and over . I have scars and wounds . Sometimes , when I can 't ... bear them any more , I ... I drink . You can 't fix me . You can 't fix any of us . You can 't make us perfect . But I 'm not like them , am I ? You were keeping me quiet , because nobody resigns from Summakor . Not on your watch , huh ? Am I right ? You just listen to yourself . Your integrity , your vision . We threw at you everything we had . Love , loathing ... .. death itself - and still you resist . Well , now I see ... you are not the problem , Michael . You 're a challenge , but an asset , an opportunity . To take us forward . Ah , yes . We 're here . ( Groaning ) You want him to live ? 313 : Yes . At any cost ? I want him to live . I can give you that . ( Groaning ) That is why I wanted you to watch him here , to see him . You must answer a question honestly . My son ... Am I the reason ? Yes . Thank you . There 's something thrilling about honesty . Don 't you think ? To face yourself . The inside 2 . 6 was right . I 'll admit it . Death was not enough to crack 6 open , but he was wrong . Village death was not my last throw . I have the perfect means of assimilation for him . I know 6 better than 6 knows 6 . He 's in love with his own humanity . He adores the sweet smell of his own bright , shining conscience . Noble 6 . He only wants to do the right thing . And that is what will give him to me . That ... .. and you . - Me ? - You want 6 to live . Then I can give you your part in his fate . When the moment comes , you will know . And you will choose ... to give yourselfto 6 .

You gotta wear the hat . Drew , the only reason you make us wear a hat is because ... the manager made you wear a hat when you were drunk .

I 've tried his cellphone . - Carrie , listen to me . Ray was pushing real hard last night . I 'm sure he 's still looking . Cell reception out there ... He always calls , Eddie . Ray , you down there ? I cannot believe this is Ray Adams . I don 't wanna believe it either . Do you know what it would take for a man to do this ? For someone to skin a human being ? No tracks . Nothing . Eddie , you 're in over your head . What are you gonna do ? I 'll let you know when I figure it out . Hey . - Hey , Jessie . Hi . You know , you looked at me the same way in class .

Listen , Lieutenant , I don 't know what your men are walking into .. .. but our situation is getting worse . Lieutenant , come in . Are you there ? [ Radio ] We have a missing man . - Hold on , sheriff . We 've got contact ! ... [ indistinct chatter ] We 've been ambushed ! What the hell 's going on out there ? Fall back ! I repeat , fall back ! Lieutenant ! Lieutenant , are you there ? [ Static ] Lieutenant , come in . Are you there ? We 're not gonna make it are we ? Don 't shoot , take what you want . I 'm not gonna get killed for no $ 6.25 an hour . We 've been attacked . - Terrorists in Gunnison ? I told you they would , one day . What are you guys , stoned ? Do you see that ? Are you hurt ? Come on in . It should be safe here . Hold up . Barely got a pulse . Take him straight to trauma . Hi . - - When are the lights going back on ? We 're on emergency generators , until the power 's restored . Oh , I think my water just broke . Okay , I 'll find a doctor . You two look pretty shaken up . - Hasn 't been an easy night for her . And what about you ? I 'll live . We 're leaving in 5 minutes . Thank you . Where is he ? Give me the gun ! Come on ! Mommy ! Turn back ! It 's a trap ! It 's a trap ! It 's a trap !

There may be weapons and equipment we can still use . Radio . National Guard , come in . Repeat , any National Guard unit , come in . This is Colonel Stevens , US Army . Identify yourself . Sheriff Eddie Morales , Gunnyson , Colorado . You have to help us , Colonel . There 's some kind of infestation ... .. and if we don 't get help soon , there won 't be any of us left . What 's the Army 's evacuation plan ? Colonel ? Colonel , we need immediate evac . Sheriff , all ground routes have been compromised . There is an airlift , in 30 minutes from Gilliam Circle . Confirmed . Airlift . Gilliam Circle . We 'll be there in 20 minutes . But that 's right in the center of town . We 'll be there , Colonel . What the fuck are you ? Everyone , get in the Stryker . I 'll drive . So you can drive that thing ? Alright . I 'll get on the gun . - Don 't miss . Don 't crash . Hold on . Why are we stopping ? - It doesn 't make any sense . Gillian Circle is right in the center of town . We 'll be surrounded by those things . Wait a second , what are you saying ? - I think that the Colonel was lying . But that 's crazy . The government doesn 't lie to people . The army thinks about containment first . They can 't risk this getting any worse . Help is a few miles down that road and they 're waiting for us . Now if you won 't drive us there , I will . Eddie , if she 's right , then the only thing down that road are more of those things . You 're not seriously considering this ? - I 'm considering whatever keeps us alive . Which means getting out of this town . There are only two helicopters in town . One 's at the airport .. No , it 's too far . We 'll never make it . - The other one 's at the hospital . The people at the hospital probably used it to get out . That 's a chance we have to take . If you 're wrong and the helicopter is gone , we 're all dead . If I am right , they 're dead if they follow you . There 's a truck coming . Dallas , what the hell are you doing in there ? - Never mind that . You guys heading to the air lift ? - Yeah . Ok , follow us . We don 't have much time . Listen up . Everybody 's gotta choose right now . We 're going to the hospital with the tank . We all need to go to the center of town . - That 's right . I 'm going with my brother . - I 'm with you . I 'm going in the tank . Dallas , don 't do this . She 's wrong . And brother or not , he 's wrong . You 're gonna get them killed . We are running out of time , Sheriff , We gotta move now . Hold on . We 're coming with you . Wait . Take care . I hope we 're both wrong . Lets go . I didn 't help anybody . I was too scared . I just watched them die . All right , put these on . You too . All right , listen . Whatever happens inside , the only person that can 't get hurt is Kelly , alright ? We all protect Kelly . What is this , the Titanic ? Screw the " women and children first " shit , man . Look , asshole , unless you can fly the helicopter , shut the fuck up . Let 's go . Maybe they 've all gone . Fucking shoot it ! Jesse , no wait ! - Move , now . Jesse , no , wait ! Ricky , wait . - - Motherfucker ! Come on . Come on , get up . You 're gonna make it . We have to go . Now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! [ Indistinct shouting ] Joe .. Is this everybody ? - This is all that 's left . What have you heard ? - The air lift will be here soon . Clear ! Come on ! Go go ! You all right ? - Yes . Come here , Molly . Go go . Follow your mom . Come on . - Everyone , move . Run Molly . Dallas . - I 'm trying . Are you going to shoot that thing ? - Hang on . Lets go . You got her ? Colonel Stevens ? This is Gunnison County ... requesting status on evac , over . Colonel , where 's the air lift ? Sheriff , we are 10 miles out . Hold your position , over . Colonel , we 're here over . God help us all . Alright , get out of here , now . I 'm gonna buy us some time . I 'm not leaving you . - Get to the chopper . You don 't have to do this , Dallas . Now ! Go , go ! Come on , you motherfuckers ! Hey ! Over here . Come on . OK , go . Hey , come on over here ! We 're not leaving without him . - We have to go . He 'll make it . Die ! Let 's go ! Close your eyes . Hang on . - Mommy . Hang on . Hey , you 're all right ? Ricky ? - Press harder , honey . Drop your weapons ! You bastards killed the entire town . - We 're just following orders . Put down your weapons . We need a medic , for my brother . Medivac is inbound . Secure any weapons and let 's set up a perimeter . Go , move it . Thought I told you not to crash ? Mommy ? Are the monsters gone ? They 're gone . The world isn 't ready for this technology . But this isn 't for our world , is it Miss Yutani ?

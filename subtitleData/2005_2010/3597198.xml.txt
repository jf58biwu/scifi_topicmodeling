 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives It 's home to things beyond your imagination . There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall , a genetically engineered boy genius in the attic , a schoolgirl investigator across the road , and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . There he is ! Don 't let him get away ! That 's impossible ! No , it isn 't ! He 's got to be in here somewhere . He 's just a kid ! What does he want with a ... what 's it called ? A matter compressor . Maybe he wants some matter compressed ? Whatever his reason , the Pharos Institute need it back ! Split up . SQUELCH ! Did you hear that ? It can 't be ... It is ! The Slitheen ! They 're back ! Oi ! Get off me . Are you OK ? Don 't worry about us , where did it go ? If Slitheen are back on Earth it means mayhem on a global scale . What do they want this time ? Same as usual convert our planet into cash . Then how do we find it ? We 'd need a bloodhound . Oh , why didn 't I think of that ? WHISTLE BLOWS Mistress . Activating hover mode . What are you doing out of your disguise ? Can 't run in human skin . It 's too tight . Needed to lose them . Lose who ? Give you one guess . Sarah Jane Smith . I wondered how long it 'd be till she shoved her oar in . Yeah , but I got away . And I nabbed the matter compressor . We wouldn 't have had to steal one if you hadn 't sat on ours ! Now nothing can stop us from turning this scuzzy little planet into a massive money-spinner . WHIRRING And so it begins ! Greetings Mistress ! We need you to follow a trail , K9 . He can smell ? How ? Psychospore and olfactory sensors . Yeah , yeah , that clears that up . We 're looking for a Slitheen . Alien pheromone detected , Mistress . Trail leads in this direction . Give me a visual ! Initialise compression web ! Not that one , idiot ! Compression web initialised ! Very soon the Slitheen will be the richest family in the galaxy ! Insufficient data . Insufficient data . You 've lost him , K9 ? No ! Affirmative , Mistress . We 'll never find him now . Well , that might help . Right . Follow me ! The web 's nearly complete ! When it is , Earth 'll be squished ! Just our base left . You have set the safety shield haven 't you ? Of course . Soon we 'll be relaxing on the Pleasure Moons of Pagros . This time tomorrow we 'll own the Pleasure Moons of Pagros . Switch it off , boys ! Sarah Jane Smith . How predictable . I prefer ... reliable . Now , I won 't ask you again , switch it off ! No chance ! Good try , Miss Smith , but not good enough . It 's sonic wave resistant . What does that thing actually do ? Why steal the matter compressor ? This planet 's stuffed full of carbon . And thanks to your compressor , we can crush it . And if carbon 's crushed enough it turns into a diamond . A gigantic diamond , worth a fortune . K9 ! Now ! Maximum destruction mode . It 's still going ! Grab the girl ! Get your claws off me ! Let her go ! Try that again and you 'll be sorry ! Rani , don 't move ! K9 , hold fire ! Disable the dog , or she gets it ! I 'm sorry , K9 . Power down . Unit deactivating . Isn 't there something we can do . WHOOSH ! Who are they ? Stand back , Miss Smith ! COMPUTER : Compression halted . Now release the child ! By order of the High Council of Raxas Prime , you are charged with crimes against the state . Fraud , theft , high treason . The penalty for each is death . It 's him you want ! He made me do it ! Please ! No ! I 'm innocent ! WHOOSH ! What have you done with them ? We 've teleported them to our ship . They will stand trial on our home planet . I guess , we owe you our lives . Thank you . Yeah , thanks . I was nearly Slitheen lunch . But who are you ? We are Blathereen . Blathereen ? Never heard of you . The Slitheen aren 't the only family on Raxacoricofallapatorius . But they are the only criminal one . We Blathereen respect the law . Why should we believe you ? As you can see , we do not disguise ourselves in human skin , like Slitheen . We could never kill a human . Not all visitors to your planet intend harm , Miss Smith . Some come out of anthropological interest , some are asylum-seekers . And some actually want to help . Why are YOU here ? We 've dedicated our lives to tracking down Slitheen , bringing them to justice . You mean you 're bounty hunters . It isn 't something we do for profit , it is our duty . To be honest , we 're pretty good at handling Slitheen by ourselves . We do not doubt it . Your work has great regard back home . Interstellar fame , eh , Sarah Jane ? And it is the Blathereen custom to offer thanks for such brave deeds by sitting down to dinner . And what 's on the menu ? Clyde burgers with a side of Rani ? It 's wrong to have come this far without showing our appreciation . No , that might be a bit tricky .. Why ? I think it 's a brilliant idea . A dinner party . They can 't exactly come to my place . Mr Smith 's there , and loads of alien stuff . Then they can come to mine . Your mum and dad 'll love that . They 're at a conference , remember ? That 's why I 'm staying with Sarah Jane . Does nothing sink in with you ? Come on it 's an amazing opportunity . Clyde 'll cook . He 's a secret Jamie Oliver . I can 't deny it . I suppose so , after all , they did save our lives . Miss Smith ? What do you say ? Yes , dinner would be lovely . You 're very welcome , Mrs ... Please ... my name 's Leef Apple Glyn . Leef for short . This is my husband , Tree Lorn Acre . I call him Tree . Sarah Jane . And this is Clyde , Rani , and my son , Luke . Pleased to meet you all . Let us have your teleport coordinates and we 'll join you in an hour . We must freshen up first . I 'm still not sure we can trust them . Yeah , when have the Slitheen ever helped us ? They 're not Slitheen . They 're not the same colour . Colour doesn 't matter , they 're from the same planet . We have to keep our guard up , until we 're certain . Look at me , head chef to the enemy . I didn 't know you could cook . Well , I 'm a man of many talents . And it 's only shepherd 's pie . Mum taught me . I hope they don 't have any strange dietary requirements . Though it 's hard to go wrong with soup . WHOOSH ! Good evening , Sarah Jane . Sorry it 's such a squeeze . SLURPING And this delightful liquid is ? It was tomato soup . Though you probably prefer something more meaty . Shut up , Clyde . Delicious . We must take some home , for next time the Rackateen come to dinner . They adore foreign food . So , tell us about your home planet . Raxacoricofallapatorius was once the most admired planet in the Raxas Alliance . Clom , Plix and Raxacoricovarlonpatorius all took their lead from us . And the Blathereen were one of the most respected families . Until the Slitheen bribed their way into power . They ruined our planet 's good name . Well , that must have been terrible for you . What happened to the Slitheen ? The economy crashed , then the rest of the population rose up against them , and they were deposed . Some faced justice , others fled to the farthest corners of the galaxy . It was our duty to hunt them down . We 're deeply sorry for the trouble they 've caused here . And as this seems an appropriate moment ... Tree ? This is not just a gift for your hospitality but compensation for the Slitheen 's behaviour on Earth . This is Rakweed . Careful ! It 's just a present , Clyde . His concern is understandable . Though this is something that will truly delight you . It 's lovely , thank you . It 's a staple food back home . It can grow anywhere , even in the harshest conditions . Nutritious and delicious . But this isn 't just a gift for you . We want you to share it with your entire world . We know you suffer from famines on Earth . Rakweed could put an end to them forever . Of course , if it came directly from outsiders such as ourselves , your people would be distrustful . That is why we want you , Sarah Jane , to be our ... our ambassador . Imagine the fame and the glory . I 'm not bothered about fame . We do what we do to help the world . This little plant could save millions of lives . PING ! Oh , main course . Excuse me . Can you just give me a hand ? Is this all too good to be true , or have I become totally paranoid ? You taught us to keep an open mind . Well , I 've had bad experiences , with aliens bearing gifts . Mr Smith will know if it 's dangerous . You can 't pass up a chance to feed the entire human race , can you ? Do you really think we can trust the Blathareen ? I think so . Plus , if they wanted us dead they 'd have done it by now . Not necessarily . Oh , I just don 't know . Go with your instincts . They 're always right . In this case my instincts are all over the place . Ta-daaa ! Shepherd 's pie . I made that . Shepherds are a delicacy on Earth ? Yeah , but you couldn 't eat a whole one . It 's just the name of the dish . SLURP ! BURP ! PARP ! Mmmm . More delicious than the land prawns of Clom . Might apply for MasterChef after all . So , Sarah Jane , will you be our ambassador ? It 's our chance to finally put things right . And it could mean a new friendship between our races . You realise I 'll have to analyse the Rakweed , make sure it 's safe . Of course . Do that straight away . But thank you . In principle , I ... we ... Earth accepts . It 's been a most wonderful evening . But it 's a long journey back to Raxacoricofallapatorius . Amazing to meet you both . I 'll never forget you , or what you 've given us . Will you accept the claw of friendship , Sarah Jane ? We 're sure our Rakweed will change your planet forever . And how perfect that Sarah Jane Smith will be the one to lead Earth into a rich and fertile future . Thank you , have a safe journey . Bye . Dinner with aliens , oh , and a plant that can save the world . The most exciting day ever . Mr Smith , I need you . 'How may I assist you , Sarah Jane ? ' I need you to analyse something . Such an amazing opportunity . Yeah , or it could all be a trap . They 're Blathereen not Slitheen . Ah , Slitheen , Blathereen , Whatevereen . They 're from Raxacorico-doo-dar . It has a seriously dodgy reputation . You can 't condemn an entire race just cos a few of them are bad . There are bad people on Earth , too . Rani 's right . We 're here to help aliens , not just fight them . Exactly . Sarah Jane ? This is huge . If I make this public , it 'll change everything . No more hiding in the shadows , saving the world in secret . I 'll be front page news . Sarah Jane Smith , Ambassador for Earth , eh ? MR SMITH : ' Analysis complete . 'Although the Rakweed has a more complex cell structure 'than Earth flora , there is , as far as I can tell , no threat . ' It 's harmless then ? See , nothing to worry about . Yeah , but I still don 't like it . Anyway , time you lot were in bed . School tomorrow . And you 've all got a test . Am I right ? A test ? I 'm sorry , did someone say ' test ' ? Don 't really understand that word . K9 : Test . Assessment of knowledge . Method through which one human demonstrates intellectual superiority over others . He knows what it means , K9 . Just not how to pass it . Luke , Rani , bed . I 've put a towel in your room . Clyde , home . Ah , I won 't be a sec . I just need to borrow a book for revision . How much do you know about GCSE biology ? General Certificate for Secondary Education syllabus in biological science includes seven key areas ... Yeah , I know all that . But I need your help . Can you come to school with me tomorrow ? Negative . Directional commands may only be issued by the Mistress . Well , you leave me with no choice . Sorry , boy . This unit may not be removed . MR SMITH : ' Excuse me , Clyde ... ' Please don 't tell Sarah Jane . I 'll bring him back . 'I was going to thank you . A break from the dog is most appreciated . ' Bit annoying , is he ? 'I couldn 't possibly comment . ' I 'll see myself out ! Tie . Tie ... tie ? Luke ! Rani ! Toast 's getting cold . Hurry up or you 'll be late . What 's the matter ? I feel strange . In what way ? I dunno . It 's probably nothing . It 's not nothing if you 're feeling ill . The Bane gave you perfect health . Is this what being ill is like ? How do you feel exactly ? Everything 's gone blurry . My chest is aching , my head hurts . Come on , slowcoach . What 's up ? Well , Luke 's not feeling very well . But you get off to school . Shouldn 't we call a doctor ? Rani , school , please . You should stay home this morning . I don 't want to miss the biology test . The test can wait . I 'll call the school , let them know . Rani ? Sorry I snapped . But if Luke 's ill , what do I do ? How do I explain him and what he is , to a doctor ? No , he 'll probably be fine , it 's just never happened before . I can stay home if you like . Your dad wouldn 't want you skipping school , especially when there 's a test . It was worth a try . See you later . Yeah . Oh , hello , this is Luke Smith 's mother . I 'm afraid Luke won 't be at school today , he 's not feeling very well . What you been doing in there ? I got in early to do some revision . You are such a bad liar , Clyde . It 's the truth , honest . I know when you 're up to something , and you are so up to something . How are you feeling ? Not great . Worse ? Right . Let 's be methodical about this , go back to the beginning . What were you doing when it started ? I was in the attic . The attic . MR SMITH : ' Analysis complete . 'The Rakweed is NOT harmless . ' I knew it ! Blathereen ! 'Adaptation to its cell structure suggests a more deadly life-form . ' Couldn 't you have seen this coming ? 'I 'm sorry , but the plant appears to have mutated since my last report . ' I can see that . There 's a great big flower sticking out of it now ! 'It was probably in a state of deep hibernation . 'Something must have triggered its development cycle . ' What 's going on ? You should be in bed . 'According to my analysis , Rakweed seeks out life forms that it deems 'a threat to its propagation and drains them of energy . 'It will send its victims into a deep , deep coma 'from which they will never return . ' That 's so weird about Lukey-boy . He 's never got sick before . Hope it 's nothing serious . Sarah Jane was really worried . How 's the pot plant ? Savaged anyone in the night ? That 's not funny , Clyde . This Rakweed stuff might be amazing . It could feed millions of people . Yeah , yeah , but it 'll probably still taste like salad , like the world needs more salad . Do you know what cynical means ? It 's what I call being realistic . Where are you going ? Sit here . Yeah , well I normally sit over here so ... You 're acting really weird . What are you up to ? Good morning , Mistress Rani . K9 ? ! MR SMITH : 'Emergency analysis continuing . ' Luke , you 're all I 've really got . Everything else , it 's meaningless , makes no sense without you . 'I 'm sorry to have to tell you , but my sensors indicate 'that the Rakweed is not confined merely to this house . ' How ? ! 'It has already reproduced itself . 'Most likely by releasing spores . ' Like a fungus ? They must have got out through the window . We 've got to stop this ! Mum , I 'm so tired . Luke , please ... Luke , can you hear me ? I 'm OK . What 's this ? ' He has been subjected to an incredibly high dose 'of Rakweed spores . ' Luke , Luke , you must stay awake . Sarah Jane will hit the roof ! Sarah Jane isn 't gonna find out . What if someone hears him ? He makes a right racket . Ah , I borrowed this too . Relays his voice straight into my ear . Using K9 to pass a test , even by your standards this is a new level of stupid . We may not be allowed textbooks , but no-one said anything about a super-intelligent robot dog from the year 5000 . You 're insane . Yep , an insane genius . I hope you two are paying attention . Course , Miss , raring to go . WHIRRING This is all my fault . Mum ! Look ! Mr Smith ! I need you ! Mr Smith ! Please ! Help us ! MR SMITH : 'At its current rate of propagation , 'the Rakweed will have seeded the whole of London within a few hours . ' Is that ... Rakweed ? Ah ! We 've got to stop this , come on . The Rakweed - it got you didn 't it , are you OK ? I 'm Blathareened . 'Luke ? ' So how far has this spread , just the school grounds ? Or further ? It 's everywhere . Let the hunt begin !

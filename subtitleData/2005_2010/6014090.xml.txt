 Last week on ... The Venture Brothers ! Part One of ... Escape to the House of Mummies ! Created by Tim , the self-created . Hatched by the same egg from which emerged raw . Behold the Perfect Man ! Praise ye who will reign over all . That 's very impressive . It looks like he hates his foot . Still , he 's been doing that all day . You boys have to get Caligula and Dr. Freud back to the time machine . Don 't let him ask about me . - Will do ! - Wait ! Where 's the Hand of Osiris ? We told the Caligula guy to hide it . Oh , dear Lord . No , no . Just drop it there . I 'll get it later . I command you to release them ! Drop to your knees , you ignorant savages ! I am your giant four-armed God ! And I make light from one of my two slightly smaller hands ! It 's just a flashlight ! Kill them ! Dean , stop riding the Perfect Man . Brock has to kill him now . - Can 't we keep him ? - Yeah , dad , can 't we ? We 'll feed the Perfect Man and clean up after him and everything . Super swear . Please ? No . He 's an abomination . Go ahead , Brock . We have more bullets , you know . You got to stop doing that . Yeah , I know . It just looks so cool . Well , go get it . Fine . Give me the Hand of Osiris ! - Give me head . - You didn 't just say that . I absolutely did . What are you gonna do about it ? - But I 'm about to kill your sons . - Join the club . Bring them to the Hall of Sorrows ! And now ... tonight 's dramatic Part Two of The Venture Brothers , in ... Escape to the House of Mummies ! Is anybody else not impressed by the Hall of Sorrows ? Yeah . It looks more like a basement than a hall . Can you fit through there ? I can 't get my shoulders in . I bet you could fit . Great ! Way to be useless , Dean . When I was your age , all I did was crawl through holes . Holes half that size , mind you . If you want a job done right , I have to do it . Boy adventurers , what do you need ? A road map ? It 's simple ! Don 't get shot by the enemy , stumble on the robot factory ... pull up a couple of rubber masks , and crawl through holes ! Is that sound what I think it is ? Oh , yeah . These guys are playing it by the book . We need to come up with a plan fast . I have an idea . You should call Dr. O ! He 's magic ! That is the fifth time you suggested that stupid idea . We 're not possessed , we 're trapped . I 'll go back in that hole . I think better in holes . That 's all we got , Doc . You might as well try Hank 's idea . Will you listen to what you just said ? I know it sounds insane , but Hank has the only idea . I would rather die than call that snake charmer for help . - He 'll never let me hear the end of it ! - All right , boys , you heard your father . We 're all gonna die , so you might want to line up ... so that the spikes will pierce your brain or heart . All right , let 's start positioning ourselves . No fun bleeding to death . All right , all right , all right , all right . Fine . Dr. Orpheus , master of mysticism . Orpheus , it 's your landlord . We 're trapped in a clich√© . Use your fake , impossible magic to get us out of here . What ? Mr. Venture ... I don 't think I can do that . - Well , what can you do ? - Let 's see ... I could astral-project myself there ? That 's it ? Super ! Yeah . Come on over and watch us die . Spiked walls are closing in on us and you want to put on a puppet show . Hold on a second . Hank , get off those spikes ! It 's not a ride ! Spiked walls ? How fast ? Slower than haunted house spiked walls ... but not quite as slow as evil scientist 's spiked walls . Good ! - Dean , can you hear me ? - Yes ! Dean , picture my daughter naked . - Think of her as yours . - Look , you lunatic ... stop worrying about inheriting my estate and get us out of here ! Venture family , you must trust me ! Dean , think only of my daughter kissing you . Kissing you on the mouth . Think harder , boy ! She 's using her tongue ! There ! I have located you ! - Didn 't expect that . - All right . I 'm getting out of here before Dean wakes up crying . I 'll be back soon with expensive crap to get you all out of here . Wake up ! Which one of you broke the Hall of Sorrows ? Don 't know . Why ? What was supposed to happen ? Those walls are supposed to crush you ... and then scolding hot oil comes out of the jackal 's mouth . Sorry . We missed it . Oh , yeah , of course ! Oil ! Yeah . Makes sense now . Thought you told me to fill it with hot voil . What ? What the hell is voil ? It 's a soft sheer fabric . I warmed some up in the dryer . What the ? Are you insane ? ! What kind of torture is that ? Get out of here ! I 'm serious . I don 't even want to look at you anymore . Believers these days ! What happened to the annoying one ? - We ate him . - I 'm losing my patience . Wait . Hold on . I got a ... - Bless you . - Oh , great ! It 's all full of spit now , and it smells like a wet cat . Mr. Venture ! Are you in need of assistance ? It is I , Dr. Orpheus ! - Mr. Venture ! - Lab . I 'm in the lab . You windbag . I was quite concerned for your well-being ! I have not slept a wink . You 're safe ! I am pleased that I could help . Help schmelp . Brock and the boys are still trapped . Probably dead by now . - We must help them ! - No , duh . I have the zero point magnets somewhere that 'll take the pyramid walls down in a jiff . - So , thanks for nothing . - Pyramid ? Yeah . We were trapped in a pyramid ! Some stupid cult made a time machine . What pyramid cult ? I don 't know . Papyrus , Osiris , something like that . - You ever heard of him ? - Osiris cult ? ! Osiris ? ! Firstborn son of the womb of Nut ... begotten of Seb , the lord of a Akert ... whose existence is for everlasting ! Yes , I 've heard of him . Do you even know what I do for a living ? ! I don 't know . Card tricks and children 's birthday parties ? No , sir ! You stand not on solid ground . Below this earth you trust to be solid is a net . This unknowable safety net keeps your soft pink insignificance ... from plunging eternally towards oblivion ! My job , sir , is to repair that net ! Now thank me ! Thank you for saving me from the boogie man . I saved your life from half-away around the globe . Look , Kreskin , I have 20 devices in this lab that can do that . I 'm a super scientist . My father was a super scientist , his father was a super scientist ... and his father was ... No , wait . No , I think he was a milliner . Either way , I 'm not impressed with your tricks . Tricks ? How dare you ? ! With just a thought , I could rise into the air ! Or you could put on these anti-gravity boots . I could incinerate this entire lab ! Make you believe that you are a very special episode of Blossom ! And shoot lightning from my hands ! Laser ray , mind control helmet , Tesla coil . Anything else ? Any time , any place . You name the contest . We shall celebrate your inflated sense of self ... with the ultimate contest ! Shrinking ! And I , like the Puss in Boots ... shall gobble you up ... bones and all ! Fine ! Eight o 'clock tomorrow ! Right here . - Smallest man is the biggest man . - Fine ! - Good day , sir . - Good blah blah , sir . And I wouldn 't bother looking for that shrink ray your father built . He sold it to the albino and his tiny companion . Ta-ta ! Crap . Dean ? - Dean ? ! - I 'm over here . - What happened ? - Yeah , Clarissa , explain it all . That guy with the bird head , he has this mummy army . And one of the mummies has a magic scepter . Don 't move , Hank ! - He 's right behind you ! - What ? ! Him ? That 's just Mummy Mum Muggy . He 's a good mummy , Deano . Right ? Muggy friend . Muggy like his chin rubbed . Who 's a good mummy ? Get your brother 's head and follow me . There has to be a way out of here . Muggy might know . Where 's the exit ? Tell us , boy . This is getting stupid ! Where the hell is your father ? ! You that is tall , go to the small ! I command you by the intimate whispers of vulgary ... shrink ! Oh , come on ! No use crying over spilled magic . Pumpkin , do you still have that dollhouse meemaw gave you ? No , no . You 're thinking of Roger Lawn . Joe Rogan is the host of Fear Factor ... You 're kidding me ! Bad news , Billy . Our place has been trashed . - What ? Holy cow ! Great news ! - Getting burglarized is great news ? Come on , White . This is clear evidence of an arson . Our own archenemy . We have arrived . I 'm going to change into my Quizboy costume . - He 's still here . - All right , Nemesis . Show yourself and you 'll be spared a blast from my laser hand . Dr. Venture ? You 're our archenemy ? It 's industrial espionage ! You 've come to steal our great ideas . - You 've been foiled . We have none . - What the hell , Rust ? What kind of dick breaks into his friend 's house ? - I need that shrink ray I sold you . - Yeah . Don 't call us and ask for it , just break into our home and steal it back . I already apologized for that ! - When ? - No , you didn 't . Man , I almost killed you with my hand . Enough , Billy . Everybody knows your hand doesn 't shoot lasers . - What 's this all about , Rust ? - I bet that pompous loudmouth Orpheus ... that I could shrink better with science than he could with magic . Aren 't you friends ? I mean , I 've seen him mowing your lawn . - So , you break into our trailer ? - Do you have it or not ? - Here it is . - What 'd you do ? Drive over it ? Don 't look at me . Ask Captain Kid over there . It didn 't work ! So I thought maybe there was a treasure map or something stuck in ... Don 't bother . I 've been over this with him , like , a thousand times . Well , you two have to help me fix it ! Rusty , you broke into our house and trashed it . All right , fine . I 'll pay you . - That 's all I needed to hear . - And I get paid for lunches , you know . - Think on , spirit . - Come on , Mr. Poe . Just tell me where you put the Hand of Osiris and I 'll let you go . Basement . Under the floorboards . I got to admit , I always wanted to get Edgar Allan Poe in a headlock . That thing is like a pumpkin ! We just completely screwed up that guy 's life with our time machine ! - You think we messed up the past ? - I wouldn 't worry about that . I knew it ! Pumpkin , what are you doing in your room ? Shouldn 't you be not in your room ? My whole life I 've been afraid of that closet . There 's always these weird lights ... and something that smells like a burning Band-Aid . Brimstone . OK , fine . Porthole to the burning nowhere . You got me . Dad , I thought I was going crazy ! I mean , I 'm still afraid of the closet . Still ! I wear the same thing every day because of that closet ! Well , how was I to know ? Come now . Archie and his indolent companion Jughead wear the same clothes every day . I thought it was an adolescent phase of yours . - Great ! My closet is the door to hell . - The Necropolis ! A porthole to the Necropolis . It had to be on the south side of the apartment . And since you had to have a private bathroom ... Oh , this is never ... Sleep ! In your sleep , all is forgotten . Got it ! Why didn 't I think of that before ? I need more time . There 's too many variables . OK . I 'm done here . Much more difficult than I expected . What have you guys come up with for , let 's say , number two ? Number two ? Rhea Perlman . What 'd you put down ? Joyce DeWitt was number two . Number one , Bonnie Bedelia . The mother from Die Hard ? The stone fox from A Mother 's Right : The Elizabeth Morgan Story . Yes . - What 'd you put down ? - I misunderstood the question . - Give it here . - I was confused with the wording . I 'm serious ! I didn 't realize what you meant by " guilty pleasure . " Jeez , Billy . Oiled garbage bag ? Sweat sock ? Oh , my God , number three . " Melon heated in a microwave . " That 's very creative , Billy . I 'm sure your mother is proud of you . - Give me that , White . - Hilarious . OK , let 's get back to work . - We 're having fun here . - No , no . Fun is number five ... which simply states , " dust buster with corner attachment . " That sounds dangerous . I didn 't understand the question ! Hello ? ! Master ? ! Right on the nose . - You have no idea how much that stings . - Master ? Yes . Man ! Right on the f ... tip of my snout . God ! My eyes are watering . All six of them . - So sorry , master ! - All right . I did not recognize you in your random form . So you shoot lightning at my face ? Way to think it out , Orpheus . No wonder you have no friends . - That 's a bit harsh . I have many friends . - Name one , and Dr. Venture doesn 't count . Look , Orpheus , I know why you 're here ... and I chose the form of Argos to teach you a little lesson . Don 't you mean Cerberus ? Correct me if I 'm wrong ... abut Argos was Ulysses ' dog . He had only one head . See ? There you go . Right there . That 's what I 'm talking about . You 're a know-it-all . And no one likes a ... Wait . - Hold on a second . - I only know that I know nothing . Way to quote something I said , like , a year ago . But I 'm serious . Hold on . This other head likes to clean my genitals with his mouth . I know it sounds weird . I let him do it , 'cause it feels great . Oh , yeah . The problem is I can taste it . So ... I taste my own genitals . In my mouth . It 's ... a conundrum . - Master , what bearing does this ? - Would you let me enjoy this ? Damn , don 't you know how good this feels ? ! Wait . I 'm sorry . Your wife left you because you don 't know how good this feels ! My wife left me because of the persistent advances of a younger man ! No . She left you because you spent most of your time working . Well , yes . I was saving the world from a secret peril ! And your precious free time was spent , like , Mr. Rogers in a cape . She left you because you 're a wussy ! - There 's dad ! - Well , it 's about damn time . - Looks like he 's been captured again . - And there 's your body , Deano ! It has an extra head on it . Oh , no ! They captured me , too . Hank , what year did you set the time machine to ? The year 1230 A.D. Yeah , I 'm pretty sure that you set it to 12 : 30 A.M. I 've done it again . All right . She 's ready to test . Who is the guinea pig ? I 'm an albino . I can 't even go to the beach without exploding . No way I 'm standing in front of an anything-ray . Single parent . Those boys need me . I am their rock . Don 't look at me ! I have not lived enough ... for I have never tasted the flower of a woman . What do you mean ? " Tasted a flower ? " Is that a direct metaphor ? 'Cause I don 't take many trips down south myself . You guys are disgusting . No , I mean I haven 't sampled the fruits of the fairer sex . What 's with the poetry , Wordsworth ? Just say it ! Say , " I am a virgin . " I knew it ! That makes you the best candidate to take a ray blast . You have nothing to lose . You 've never done anything . The way I look at it , it 's not even murder . It 's a very late abortion . Wait ! Give me 24 hours to experience love . Let me know the gentle caress of a woman , let me sleep in the shade of love 's bow . I will return to you . I will return knowing the sweet taste ... - I vote Billy . - Seconded . All right , virgin . Get on the target . Oh , get behind the ear . Oh , yeah , that rules . You really think she doesn 't respect me ? How can she respect you ... when she sees you get treated like dirt by Dr. Venture ? And then you let her stay out all night partying . Party ? ! My daughter drinks ? She told me her friends do , but she ... Man , you are such a sucker ! Look at the leg . Look at the back leg . There 's nothing I can do about it . It just keeps kicking . Is that amazing ? Well , at least you hit him this time . Anything happen ? No . Nothing . Told you the phosphates were too old . It worked . You shrank my lungs . Rusty ! Oh , man ! What ? I can 't breathe over here . It 's gonna get worse . You remember that sound my chair made a second ago ? That wasn 't the chair . It 'll be there in a minute , Billy . Think deviled eggs . I hate you guys . Hank , you and Caligula keep up the rear . No . On second thought , you and Freud should do it . Caligula , you take the second wave alone . Ready , Dean ? Steady , Perfect Man ! Ready , Brock ! When the gates open , me , Poe , and me , rush in . You got that ? - You 'll kill him when he shows up , right ? - You know it . Charge ! - My ear ! - Sorry . - What happened ? - We shrank your head . - I told you we should 've mounted it . - Nice shot , William Burroughs . You hold a gun like a guy that plays Riven . Now switch to reverse and fix me ! White , are you even aiming ? Do you want me to go in the backyard and shrink some cans or something first ? - I 've never done this before , you know . - Fix me . Put it in reverse and fix me ! All right , Billy , you need to relax . Nice . You shrank the whole room . - I got to get a camera . - You look like Tobey Maguire ... in a bad Hulk costume . I need a mirror . I am a rube . I have been fooling myself my whole life . - Makes you feel pretty small , huh ? - I am an insect . Look at that . We are nothing in the eyes of the cosmos . Tiny men going about our tiny days ... believing we mean something . We are nothing . Orpheus , you are my best and brightest pupil ... even if you do taste a little salty . You 're ready , Orpheus . Now , get the hell out of this closet ... and go win that incredibly gay contest ! Go ! Go ! Are you sure this was the size of my head before ? Positive . What if we cross circuit the accelerator ? Might give us more ... ohms or something ? Give up , White . I lose . It 's eight o 'clock . Come on . You 're Rusty Venture ! - Never say die . - Die . I said it . Forget it . I 'm not my dad ! I can 't even fix something that he invented ! I was a good boy adventurer , but I suck at this . You weren 't a good boy adventurer . You were the best . - Hold on . Let me show you something . - Hello ? Mr. Venture ? Lab ! - You win . - What ? I cannot make myself any smaller than I am now . - You win . - Knew it , you charlatan ! How much was the bet for ? A million dollars , right ? Nothing . It was a gentleman 's bet . How small did you get ? Me ? It never worked right . Complete waste of time . If you 'd kept your mouth shut , you would 've won the gentleman . - Snacks ! - Good call , Billy , I 'm starved over here . No . Dr. Venture . Look at the box . I haven 't seen one of those in years . A Rusty Venture lunchbox . Not the one I had when I was a kid . This one I got on eBay . I can 't use the thermos because it smells like old milk ... plus some kid put Thundercats stickers all over it . - Why do you have one of these ? - Can 't you see , Mr. Venture ? You were the little boy-man 's hero . You were the reason I became a boy genius . Yeah , Rust . Every kid wanted to be you . Yeah . I was pretty cool . That 's me on the pterodactyl . Took him down myself . Yes . You were pretty cool . Let us retire to my sitting room ! I shall whip up a batch of my famous rice pudding ! I feel like we have forgotten to do something . Oh , my God . You 're right ! I forgot to turn off the lights . Next week on ... The Venture Brothers ! I can 't make it . I want to die . I want the caveman to eat me . Hang on , Hank ! Cut him open ! We 're gonna put the boy in there ! I thought he smelled bad ... on the outside . That 's good chowder !

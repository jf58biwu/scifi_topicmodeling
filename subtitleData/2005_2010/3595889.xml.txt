 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . It 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall , a genetically engineered boy genius in the attic , a schoolgirl investigator across the road and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . Prepare to meet the Mona Lisa . The Mona Lisa has been stolen ! This is the Mona Lisa . But it can 't be . When I act like a real teenager you want me to be perfect again . The way the Bane made me ! It 's weird enough for Sarah Jane , we should call her . No , we don 't need her , we can do this ourselves . What is that ? That is my brother . Sarah Jane ! Mum ! And that is how she 'll stay forever . What have you done with her ? Do you not like it ? I mean I know art is subjective . But I think she looks as pretty as a picture . Well , most pictures . I think we can all agree I 'm in a different league . Yeah , too right . Mmm , ta . He didn 't mean it as a compliment ! And you 're just jealous . Get my mum out of that painting ! Now ! So you can say " Sowwy " ? What ? Well , only an hour ago you didn 't need her . Nothing gets past me , kids . You were all , " We can do this ourselves . " Leave him alone ! Not such the hero now , eh ? Don 't worry , young man . Your mother is perfectly safe ... just like Miss Trupp here . As soon as Mona Lisa has found her brother , she will release them both , I 'm sure . Her brother ? It 's ... another painting . I think . - You mean that ? - Oh , boy , have we got trouble . Too right , sugar . If you know what 's good for you , I 'd butt out . I can 't do that . Whatever you 're doing , my mum was going to stop you ... and that means now I have to . Aw , couldn 't you just eat them , Harders ? They 're so sweet and they think they can handle me . And you wanna know why ? Because we can ! Come on , let 's go ! Luke ! What are you doing ? ! I keep forgetting I 've got legs now . My painting ! My mum ! Don 't worry , Harders ... I 've got it covered . Hold up ! - It 's OK ... they 're not following . - Have you got any idea how she could 've done this ? No , I don 't understand any of it . Well , we 'd better work it out . Fast . The Mona Lisa has existed for five centuries . There must be a reason she 's come to life and it has to be about this gallery . Most likely , whatever is roaring its head off down there like a caged bear with gut ache . Her brother . THUD What was that ? You heard it , too ? I thought I was just getting ringing in my ears . Where did he come from ? William Bonneville 's painting , The Dark Rider . Painted 1802 . I thought you didn 't know anything about art ? ! I don 't . But I remember everything I see . I can 't help it ! Ssssh ! Run ! This way ! He 's right behind us ! He 's a picture ... shouldn 't he be firing paint balls ? Yeah , well ... two flintlocks , two shots . He 's out of ammo . Come on . It 's a picture come to life ... He can fire as many times as he likes ! Run ! Clyde ! Split up he can only go for one of us ! Clyde , no ! He won 't harm them , will he ? They 're just children . They can 't do anything to stop you . Well , aren 't you a sweetie , Harders ? All worried about the little kiddie-winkies . But they 're children . You must have had children ! Children ? Have you seen how small that frame of mine was ? Not much room for a family in there ! I meant before . The real Lisa . Now look here , Harders ... Let 's get this straight . I AM the Mona Lisa . Not that dreary Italian housewife that sat for Leo . She laughed like a camel and farted like a donkey . That enigmatic smile everyone bangs on about ? Wind . So you get your head around this , Harders , because I won 't say it again . I am the painting come to life ! The most beautiful painting in the world . The legend made flesh . Finally , you 're getting it . Now , let 's go and find my brother ! GROWLING What kind of art could possibly make that noise ? What kind of art is that ? That 's not art . That 's a window . That 's the real world . What 's it like ? Outside . Well , it 's roomier than in here . And some of it has grass on . Show me . Show me what I 've missed . Show me the sky . Open it . I want to see ... I want to touch ... There 's so much of it . An entire world to walk . No ! I 've not been released from wood and paint to be trapped in here ! This is such a cheat ! We could make a home for you here . Well , this wing is being refurbished . It could be yours . A suite , a whole floor , you could live here . A thinking , breathing work of art ! I don 't want to be a work of art ! Where is the fun in hanging on walls ? He 's speaking to me . Yes , my brother in living paint . Of course . I see . Once we are united , we will both be free and nothing will stand in our way . Not gallery walls or pathetic humans ! I hope Clyde 's OK . Clyde can look after himself . Yeah . Euch , that woman 's face is everywhere . We have to find a way to release Mum . Why did we have that stupid row about my room ? Because that 's what happens . Sometimes parents , they just get on your case . Mum and me , we 've never argued before . Don 't worry , Luke . You 'll get a chance to make it up . He has spoken . Now I know who my brother is . He is a work so terrible that no-one has laid eyes on it since it was first created ! No , it can 't be ... That 's just a legend . A story the cleaners and night staff scare each other with ... It doesn 't really exist . My brother and I have waited all these years to be brought together . Five centuries , Harders . And now you are the man for the job . So you take me to him , and we will set him free ! Mona Lisa 's looking for her brother . Another painting in the gallery with some sort of connection to her . Could that be why she 's come to life ... the two of them so close ? It 's the logical explanation . Perhaps if we can find it before she does , we can stop her . There has to be something in these books to help . And now he calls to me , from the vaults below ... and now look what we have to bring him ... After five centuries , he might just feel a little bit peckish . What is that thing ? Tell him , Harders . A painting that shouldn 't exist . And now it 's time for a viewing . Bring him ! There 's nothing . No clue to any painting linked to the Mona Lisa or Leonardo . What about a painting that isn 't supposed to exist ? What ? A legend . A painting too terrifying to be exhibited , even to look at . The Abomination . The story says that it was painted by Giuseppe Di Cattivo , known in 15th Century Florence as the Artist of Nightmares . So he didn 't paint fluffy lambs and bunny rabbits , then ? Even at the time his paintings were considered disturbing , an affront to Creation . The Abomination was said to have been his masterpiece . " But when Guiseppe saw what he had painted , a terror gripped him . " He realised no-one could look on his creation without losing their sanity . " And he locked the painting in a special case , made with wood " from a hangman 's gallows to keep the Abomination " from human eyes for all eternity . " He secured the case with a complex Chinese puzzle-lock . The next morning he was found in his Florence apartments beside the wooden case . He had gone completely insane . " The secret of the puzzle was " lost to his ravaged mind , and the painting has never been unlocked . " Isn 't that just a corker of a story ? Except it 's not just a story , is it ? We 're about to find out . The gallery took possession of a collection of Giuseppe 's works in Victorian times . This is the door to the vaults . You don 't really think this is all going to work out happily ever after , do you ? Ever since man first drew on cave walls , all any artist ever wanted to do was breathe life into what they created . Can 't you appreciate the wonder of what has happened today ? Can 't you appreciate that she 's nuts ? Standing right here , boys . Right , Harders , you first . Giuseppe Di Cattivo ... Why does that name mean something ? I don 't know . I do know one thing . He was in Florence . And that 's where Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa . Plus , earlier she said something about Leonardo using paint from his " weirdo neighbour " . That 's it ! That 's where I 've seen the name before ! Come on ! Leonardo da Vinci and Giuseppe di Cattivo were both in Florence ... and must have used the same paint for both pictures . That still doesn 't explain how both of them are coming to life . Paint is a mineral pigment held in oil . What if the minerals came from a rock that fell from space ? A meteorite ? Like the one that created Odd Bob the Clown . An energy that survived on emotion . For five centuries they were apart and inactive . Dormant . Bringing them together has brought them to life . Clyde said it sounded like a caged bear and that 's exactly what it is . And we think the Mona Lisa is bad news . Look ! Clyde 's bag . Don 't worry . We can stop this . I 've never been as far inside the old vaults before , it 's filthy . You don 't say . But the stories say the Abomination is down here somewhere . Well , I don 't see my brother ! If you 're playing games with me , Harders , I 'll feed you to him , as well , feet first ! I think that 's your brother calling . GROWLING Move it ! Once she 's unlocked her brother , she 'll be finished with you . Helping her isn 't going to make any difference . Believe me , we 're both going to get abominated . I know . But what can I do now ? GROWLING If you ask me he doesn 't seem all that pleased to see you . Show some respect for my brother in living paint . Cos once he 's out of there ... then you 'll see some fireworks ! Lisa , you can 't do this ! He 's right , you can 't . What 's this , Harders ? Remember where you left your backbone all of a sudden ? No . The puzzle-lock is missing . Where is it ? ! Giuseppe 's Chinese puzzle-lock . I knew I 'd seen it . I remember everything I see . I don 't really get art . Whoa , it 's an art gallery . But I knew this was something else . Not art . Part of a complex locking mechanism . Part ? This is the key to the Abomination . Somehow , it was separated from the painting and catalogued by the gallery as just another work of art . No-one ever realized what it really was . But if Mona Lisa wants to free The Abomination she 's going to need this . And we can use that to force her to release Mum . You 're going to bargain with her ? It 's a nice idea , kid . But I don 't do deals . Not while I 'm packing heat . Go fetch . If you fire that blaster at us , you 'll destroy the puzzle-lock . That 's why I 'm not going to fire it then . Unless you do something stupid like smash the puzzle . Which you won 't . Because I 've got your friend , Clydey . Where is he ? What have you done to him ? Don 't worry . He 's all right . But you 'd better give me the puzzle-lock . Now it 's me you 're bargaining with . What ? ! I 've been a fool . Well , I could 've told you that any day . Now give me the puzzle . I thought you were wonderful . I dedicated my professional life - no , my life - to bringing you to this gallery . I know , I know , you 're my Number One Fan ... .. now give me the puzzle-lock . Not until you have released Miss Trupp , and this young man 's mother . Oh , you can threaten me with your ray gun , it makes no difference . I 'm responsible for this mess . It 's time I took a stand . You won 't . You wouldn 't dare . All these pretty pictures are too precious to you ... all that history , all the colours ... No ! ABOMINATION GROWLS Oh , you 're so gonna wish you hadn 't done that , well , for about a second , anyway ! No ! Don 't ! There 's another way to release the Abomination . I can help you ! You ? Luke ? But first you have to take me to Clyde . So , did you know Dick Turpin , then ? You don 't say a lot , do you ? Of course you can 't talk ... you only got painted with that mask . You don 't have a mouth . A highwayman that can 't say " Stand and deliver " . Not much of a highwayman , really , are you ? Clyde ! Guys ! I knew you 'd show up . Trouble is , I 've still got Silent Bob here . SOMETHING SNARLS Oh , and him . Oh , ey up , I do love a good reunion , me . Now whatever it is you 're going to do , you get on with it . SHE TUTS My brother 's becoming restless . What 's going on ? Luke 's got a plan . You 're going to release the Abomination . I 'm what ? ! Mr Harding destroyed the puzzle lock . You can draw a new one . I can ? OK . I can . But why would I ? Mona Lisa will make the picture real and use it to unlock the Abomination . Which will then rampage across Earth and everyone that sees it will go mad or die . Probably both . I want Mum back . You can 't trust her . Even I realise that now . He 's right mate . You know , Clydey , this Sultana blaster . I think you mean Sontaran . Woteva ! It hasn 't seen much use , that could easily change . Do it , Clyde . She can 't use the photograph . She has to use something that 's been drawn , something that 's been invested with human energy ! Luke , are you sure about this ? I know you 're upset , but this seems wrong . Sarah Jane wouldn 't want us doing this . It 's not her way . You 're right . I 'm not doing this Mum 's way . This is my way . Draw it . Please . Just do it . That 's the way , Clydey . Now you make this your best work , in fact , you make it a masterpiece . I can 't believe you 're doing this . Just trust me . ABOMINATION GROWLS My brother in living paint ! Your wait will soon be over , and then your reign of fire and sulphur shall begin . And the world will be a rage of flames at our feet . You have to stop this , Mona Lisa . I thought you wanted to experience the world , not destroy it ? What use is that to me ? A world of flowers and trees , or ablaze with fire and torrents of molten lava ? That 's it ! You mustn 't do this , Clyde . Tear it up ! No ! It 's finished . I 'm sorry . And now it is time to release my brother ! Give it to me . Oooh , that 's not bad , Clydey , that 's not bad at all . I hope you know what you 're doing , my padawan . You 've gone right over to the dark side . I have it ! I really hope you know what you 're doing ! Here , my brother ... your deliverance ! You are free ! It 's coming out ! Don 't look at it ! My brother ! K9 ? Now ! What is that ? Where did you come from ? ! Who let that metal mutt in here ? Don 't mess with my dog , Lisa ! No ! No , my brother . Don 't abandon me . No ! Maximum pigmentation dispersal . I 'm not having this ! K9 ... look out ! What 's happening ! You ... shoot ' em ! NO ! Everything it did is being reversed . Oh , good work , K9 ! Thank you , Mistress Rani . I can 't go back into that frame ! I won 't ! You 've got no choice . Please ! That room that you promised me . A living work of art , that 's what you said . I 'll do it ! I 'll do anything if you let me stay here and you let me live ... He can 't help you , Lisa . No-one can . You 're going back to the way Leonardo created you ... paint and board . But I 've always been able to think ... and to feel ... And you still will . Just back in your painting . Where you belong . I want to be flesh ... NO ! NO ! And that 's the last of her , I hope . With the Abomination destroyed , she 's never coming back . K9 , my man ... He was just a drawing too ? ! From my sketchbook . It was the picture underneath . Luke wanted me to draw it so when Lisa brought the lock into existence , she brought K9 to life , too . You mean you knew what he was up to ? ! Of course I didn 't . But I trusted him . My man ! Come on , we 've got to find Mum . Mia bella . Miss Trupp ! Mum ! Oh , Luke ! You 're safe ! Where 's he going ? Oh , Miss Trupp ! Phyllis ! I 've ... had the most bizarre dream . So have I. The most bizarre , frightening dream for 25 years . When true happiness was right there under my nose . Call me Lionel . Lionel ? Call you Lionel ? It 's my name , Miss Trupp . I mean , Phyllis . My first name . I know it 's your name , " Harders " . Mona Lisa dumped you , did she ? I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . Oh , I heard you . " Mia bella ! " That ... trollop imprisoned me . And you were all over her ! You ... You ... art tart ! Phyllis ! Wait ... please ! Uh-oh ! Looks like you 've painted yourself into a corner there , Harders . A living consciousness imprisoned like that . I almost feel sorry for her . Almost ? Well , you can go off someone when they trap you in a picture . But I knew you three would be there for me . I knew you wouldn 't let me down . Well , it was all down to Luke , really . I know . And I am so proud of you . My wonderful , clever , resourceful , dependable son . And messy ? Oh , yes , that as well . But then nobody 's perfect . Yeah , look at Mona Lisa . And I 'll sort out my room when we get home . I promise . And while you 're doing that , Clyde and I will be having a little chat about Sontaran blasters . Slitheen ! They 're back . Slitheen back on Earth , it means mayhem . Switch it off , boys ! I won 't ask you again . No chance ! Stand back , Miss Smith ! But who are you ? We are Blathereen . This little plant could save millions of lives . Do you really think we can trust the Blathereen ? Let her go ! No ! Subtitles by Red Bee Media Email subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

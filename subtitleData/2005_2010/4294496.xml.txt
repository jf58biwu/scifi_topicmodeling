 Previously on Bionic Woman ... Dinner . Tomorrow night . That guy , Tom , is under some scrutiny . He only has a paper trail for the last six years . Before that , nothing . We have to assume that he 's the enemy , Jaime . I don 't believe it . My gut tells me he has nothing to do with this . The last time you listened to your gut about a guy , he had your limbs replaced . Who 's gonna have my back in there ? I 'm gonna be with you every step of the way . Okay ? You 're the good guy . Well , CIA . I mean ... It 's open to interpretation . This time , we came out ahead , we could have done better . I was thinking about Tom . I was thinking about you . God , you 're beautiful . Hey , Agent Hastings . Hey , yourself , Agent Sommers . So , I was just calling to make sure we were still on for the family dinner tomorrow night . Wow , you 're keen . I thought it was just my-sister 's-making-dinner , dinner . What 's she making ? Pasta carbonara , which I actually hate , but don 't tell her . So , what are you doing right now ? Working . And , what are you wearing ? You can 't ask me that now . All right , all right . I got it . Carry on . Just be careful . Okay ? Don 't do anything crazy . No heroics . I 'll call you back . So , where were we ? Yeah . Don 't do anything crazy . Hey , Jaime . We don 't have heavy cream or bacon , do we ? You making a heart attack ? Look , do you want me to cook dinner for your boyfriend , or not ? I want you to cook for him . I don 't want you to kill him . And he 's not my boyfriend . Yeah , tell your face that . It 's really ... It 's nice to see you happy , Jaime . I mean , you tell more jokes , and you buy me more stuff , so ... And because I 'm inherently selfish and I want this to continue , I 'm gonna make sure you make a really good impression on this guy , tonight . Okay ? Okay . So , just leave it all up to me . I will take care of everything . Great . All right . Oh ! Can I have 50 bucks to pay for all this ? Morning , Chatty . Chatty ? Yeah , I took us a look at your cell phone log . You were talking to Tom while you were out on a stakeout . Not cool . It 's not your job to monitor my calls . I am just saying , had you not been distracted , you could have taken the guy out with a lot less risk . What risk ? I 'm bionic . Bionic . Not immortal . And the risk I 'm talking about , is not you . Agent Sommers , go . It 's to Berkut . Exposure . You know what ? Don 't worry about it . You 're learning . A general rule of thumb . Relationships and counterespionage don 't mix . Is that why James Bond never had a steady girlfriend ? I think having a steady girlfriend is over-rated . You 're such a guy . Fifty caliber , depleted uranium tip . This thing will eat your guts . Created specifically for ... For the Chambliss Optical Tracking system . Which gives this rifle an effective range of up to two and a half miles . Lethality , 100 % . Two and a half miles . That 's further than I can see . Yeah . At least a mile and a half farther than any other rifle on Earth . Something the world really needed . We developed it . We , Berkut ? No . We , the United States of America . Fortunately , we recovered four dozen rounds from your bad driver last night . However , the Army managed to lose six dozen rounds along with the rifle . Lose ? It was stolen out of an armored vault . It ended up pointed at President Rudhan , Dictator of Imara , two weeks ago . So , if the ammunition is in this country now , then ... Then the rifle is , too . And President Rudhan will be here in three days . He has a horse racing at the Bay Maiden Cup . Supposedly , he trained the horse himself . Why ? Is somebody trying to kill him ? Along with being good with horses , he rules by political terror , abduction , assassination , torture . And that 's not just people he doesn 't trust . Their families , the villages , all the people . I know . I spent some time there . We 're gonna protect this guy ? Listen , they can kill him all day long in Imara . But if it happens here , it 's only going to empower the anti-American nationalists . Leaving a power vacuum in Imara . To be occupied by a fresh generation of Jihadists . Taliban comes to Africa . Right . So we protect the bad guy . Yeah . Every move that His Excellency will be making while in this country , is shown here . We trust that you , along with the CIA and the Secret Service , will insure that his visit is a pleasant one . Security won 't be a problem . Personally , I don 't see the need for American bodyguards . I have complete confidence in my men . The Imaran Security Forces are the most respected soldiers in Africa . Feared , is a more accurate word . You don 't like our country ? No , I love your country . It 's your genocidal dictator that ... No , not as much . Look at the time . We should do that perimeter check before it gets dark . It 's easy to sit in judgment . But we are trying to build a nation from the ruins of colonial exploitation . Our country would be torn apart without a strong leader to keep the peace . Peace ? What kind of peace are you talking about ? I was there . I watched your President kill thousands of his own people . So what are we looking for ? Places with a clear shot , and a good hide . If the President 's suite 's here , then ... He won 't be there , because there 's a helipad on the rooftop next door . Won 't be there , because that building overlooks that one . And if I had the pleasure of taking this monster down , I would be all alone on that rooftop . Right there . You 've done this before , haven 't you ? Taken people out on rooftops ? People sleep peaceably in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf . Churchill ? No , George Orwell . Damn . I 've got to get out of here . I have my therapy session with Ruth . And then , dinner with Tom and Becca . Well , you 've got balls , I 'll give you that . An hour with Ruth can be torture . That 's not what I 'm talking about . A relationship with a CIA operative ? After everything you 've been through with relationships , lately ? You just can 't keep your nose out , can you ? The world we work in is too intense . This relationship is never gonna work . Who is she ? Who ? The woman who broke you . Come on . Why do women always think it 's a woman ? I 'm going to get it out of you . Issues , Ruth ? Jaime , maybe we should talk about why you 've been resisting these therapy sessions . Am I ? Well , I guess because you guys make me come to them and they 're boring . I feel like a science experiment . Well , these sessions are designed to help you . You know what would help me , Ruth ? If you told me about your day . How you 're feeling . I 'm a psychiatrist . We don 't do that . Come on , Ruth . Break the rules . Knock yourself out . I mean , this place is hardly inducive to opening up and feeling comfortable . You mean , my office ? Berkut . Look , this place is about as warm as a hospital bathroom . Would it kill you guys to put up a painting ? A plant ? Rock it , a bit ? Time 's up . Thanks , Doc , it 's been a pleasure . Jaime . Stop . No . I 've already got everything how it 's supposed to be . Don 't touch anything , okay ? Calm down . It 's just dinner . Hey , calm down . It 's just dinner , okay ? Wait here , okay ? Wow . Hi . I think I just won Mystery Date . Here , these are for you . Thanks . And this . Thank you . Tom , I 'd like you to meet my sister , Becca . Hi . Hi . It 's great to meet you , finally . Yeah , you , too . I 've heard so many things about you . Come on in . Okay . We 're actually not going to have dinner out in the hallway . Well , I 'm relieved about that . Here , I 'll take these . Hi . She is adorable . I know . So , Tom , how long have you been involved in calculator manufacturing ? I moved over to the company five years ago . Wait , so , how does an executive at a calculator company and a girl who sells timeshares , how do you meet , exactly ? I bought a timeshare . He bought a timeshare . That 's fun . Where was the timeshare ? Florida . Istanbul . No . It wasn 't in Istanbul . Who buys a timeshare in Istanbul ? I 'm joking . So , who asked out whom ? I asked her out . I took one look at her and I knew I wasn 't leaving until I asked her out . In fact , she 's the reason why I bought a timeshare in Florida . I hate Florida . Hello ? Hey , Jaime . Sudden change of plans . President Rudhan is arriving at the airport , right now . Okay . I 'm on my way . I am so sorry . Big sale ? Huge sale . There 's a big thing , and I ... They need a heavy hitter , and I just have to go , okay ? I 'll make it up to you . I 'm sorry . Enjoy your meal . Bye . Watch out for those other brokers . Yeah . She does that sometimes . Yeah . What is this ? It 's Air Traffic Control 2.0 . Cool , right ? I don 't remember getting excited over version 1.0 . Five thousand planes in the air at any given time , and you 're not excited by the software that keeps them from colliding . It 's narrow thinking , Jonas . What 's it got to do with us ? Well , I was checking out air traffic patterns in preparation for Rudhan 's flight in three days . But , 2.0 alerted some unusual activity . Imara flight four-eight Charlie , slow to one-six-zero . Descend and maintain 4,000 , vector to approach . Don 't get a lot of private planes registered in Imara flying to the U.S. Maybe Rudhan 's bringing in extra security . This is why you 're going to add genius to my title . See , the software also gives me access to the computers and security cameras at Imara 's airfield . That 's President Rudhan . He boarded the plane 12 hours ago . He 's trying to sneak in under the radar . Get Jaime on the line . That airfield 's unsecured . Thank you , Nathan . I 'm glad somebody here is excited by advances in aviation and traffic control . The President of Imara has had a change of plan . He 's arriving at the airport right now . It 's a perfect opportunity for the sniper . I 'm already on my way . Antonio called me 10 minutes ago . He couldn 't have . I just found out . Whatever . I 'm on my way . I am so sorry . She 's not usually like this . She 's usually a pretty considerate person . I guess she just takes her job responsibilities really seriously . Try not to take it personally , because it 's not about you . I mean , you 're nice and I think she really likes you . So , I bet the last thing you want to do right now , is have polite dinner conversation with some old guy you just met . How about we start fresh ? Take a rain check ? I 'll take the two of you out to some fabulous dinner at a great restaurant . Maybe next week ? Yeah . Hey . It was great meeting you , finally . You too . And ... You know , Jaime 's lucky to have a sister like you . And I 'm pretty sure she knows it . All right . Great . Bye . Bye . Yeah , I 'm here . She just left a few minutes ago . Greetings , Mr. President . Antonio , the sniper . We need to secure the President . Get him away from the plane , now ! What are you talking about ? Move , move ! Come on , move ! Go , go , go . Bomani , we need to get the President out of this city , out of the country , immediately . That is not going to happen . Let me talk to him . Stop . I apologize . They don 't always have the best of manners . What do you want to tell me ? You 're not safe here . You need to get on that plane and go home . I mean , come on . It 's a horse race . It 's not worth dying over . How much time have you spent in Imara ? That would be none . I 'm not afraid to die for my beliefs and my people . I thought I might see you here . You 're on this case ? No . They just called me in for backup . Hey , where is your protective gear ? Tom . Don 't start . This isn 't me thinking you can 't handle yourself . This is me thinking about a sniper bullet that big , which almost blew out your brains . This is so typical of Berkut . They think that the rules don 't apply to them . CIA always goes by the book ? Do you mind ? Yeah , actually , I do . You 're talking to my partner , causing yet another distraction . So , back off . Tom , I 'll call you later , okay ? Well , why don 't you tell your partner that you don 't show up to a mission like this with no protection . She doesn 't even have a weapon . You 're way in over your head , and you don 't even know it . Let 's go . We 've got work to do . I told you , CIA boy was a bad idea . I don 't need relationship advice from you , Antonio . I spy with my little eye ... What is it , Sommers ? What 's that ? I don 't know , a piece of rubber ? I 'm not sure if I should trust you with it . Why is that ? You wanna tell me why you knew that guy was arriving at the airport before Jonas even called me ? Believe it or not , my good friend , Bomani , called me . You wanna level with me about this woman thing ? I was undercover in Africa about three years ago . Working with a woman . We were assigned on point on a raid for a terrorist training camp . We got the location , but they got her . I knew they were going to torture her , but I had to do my job . Get back with the intel , and leave her there . She was still there when the first cruise missile arrived . The missiles were right on target . It was considered a good mission . I 'm so sorry , Antonio . Oh , my God . You just made the whole thing up . Screw you . What ? You don 't need a story to trust me , Jaime . Just trust me . I 'm off to Berkut to show what we learned in school today . I 'm right behind you . This is all you got ? I 'll run some tests on it . How long is it going to take for you to run these tests ? You have given me a small piece of rubber . Don 't give me attitude . In that case , I 'll be at home . I have to go let Becca yell at me . Jaime . Could I show you something ? Sure . I got a plant . I want you to be comfortable here . Hi . Hey , Beccs . I 'm so sorry I had to leave you earlier . Don 't screw this one up , okay ? He is a great guy . He 's smart , funny , kind . He 's crazy about you . He 's so much better than those loser guys you usually date . Sorry , I know . That 's just how I feel . I know you have a wild , self-destructive streak . Just ... Just keep that under control . Okay ? Okay . Jaime ? I threw out the carbonara . I know how much you love it , but it doesn 't keep , so ... 'Night , Becca . Hello ? Hey , Nathan . Where are you ? I 'm in bed . Really ? What 're you wearing ? Focus , Nathan . Why are you calling me ? To gloat . I ran my little tests on that ridiculously small , so-called piece of evidence you guys gave me a mere seven hours ago , and already ... I already have a solid lead on where the guy might be . Fill me in . What you guys gave me was a piece of the sole of a high-end sneaker . On it was chlorinated residue found in residential fountains . I traced it back to the Waterfall Apartments . Antonio 's on his way over there right now . Is there a team on the way ? No , he said the guy would see that a mile away . He 's going to handle it by himself . Without me ? Well , he said not to bother you , just let you sleep . He said he could handle it . Now would be the part where you say , " Wow , Nathan , that 's really , really great work . " You 're so smart and hot . And ... " Just a little boy . She appears unarmed . Where 'd she go ? Why are you following me ? You 're going to have to talk to Agent Hastings . You got to be kidding me . I don 't have time for this . Okay . You know what ? You tell Tom Hastings you ... You know what ? I 'll tell him myself . I 'm unavailable , so please leave a message . Where the hell are you , Antonio ? Nice place ? Absolutely . I 'm glad you could come . I can 't do this anymore . Come here . Get your hands off me ! You 're crazy . How can ... They know you were here . They 're sending more agents as we speak . Just stay away from here . Stay away from here . What are you doing here ? I thought I told Nathan to let you sleep . We 're partners . Yeah . You 're right . Let 's go do this . He 's gone . Antonio was communicating with the assassin . Are you sure ? Of course I 'm sure . You want to argue with the ear ? You know , think about it . He knew the President was arriving sooner than you did . He told Nathan not to bother me . He 'd be fine by himself . He just stood there , lying to me . Going through the motions . And what did you do ? Nothing . I just pretended I didn 't hear him . Look , I haven 't been doing this very long , remember ? It 's okay . You did fine . You did fine . I knew he was stationed in Imara , five years ago . I knew he had strong feelings about the leadership there . But I didn 't know they were this strong . You 're going to have to bring him in . No , actually , you 're going to have to bring him in . You can give Antonio false information , that the President of Imara is changing his box at the racetrack . We 'll stay on his ass , bust him and the shooter . A little change of plans . Really ? Rudhan 's security told us they 've changed the location of the President 's box . He 's now going to be sitting down below . Right there . That totally changes the sniper 's sight lines . Yeah . What do you want to do ? I 'll take the tower , and you can take this other one . We can cover this , right ? Yeah . Let 's go do it . What 's up with you , today ? Nothing . Did something happen with you and CIA dude ? Maybe . I won 't say , I told you so , but they never seem to work out in this line of work . If that 's the truth , then why do you still do it ? Sometimes I don 't know . Sorry I didn 't call . I heard you took out two of my agents . I can 't believe you had me followed . Thanks for the vote of confidence . Whoa , whoa . That 's not why they followed you . Really ? Why , then ? When someone in the CIA starts a relationship , they have to tell the organization . And then , they check that person out . That 's all . So I told them that you were my girlfriend . On paper . Right . You know , are you who you say you are ? And do you live where you say you live ? Normal stuff in our line of work . Okay . Are you okay with that ? Well , not being followed , but the other thing . I don 't know . I have so much going on right now . Well , what 's going on ? I can 't tell you . I 'll call you later , okay ? All right . Ladies and gentlemen , the official results are in on Race Eight . Venus Pride in first , with a twelve-eight . Straight Up , No Olives , second , with a five-nine . Dennis Gold Show with ... The horses are on their way to the gate , for the Bay Maiden Cup . Graded stakes race with a million dollar purse . All betting windows are now open . You wanna tell me what the hell is going on ? I heard you with the assassin . I know you 're in on this . Did you tell Jonas ? I had to tell him . I 'm not working with the assassin , but I do know her . Her ? Will you just tell me the truth ? We were stationed together in Imara about three years ago . We saw a lot of bad things . She 's been working underground against the Imaran government ever since . She 's in too deep . She 's lost . It happens . When I heard about the assassination attempt , I felt like it might be her . The night at the airport , I found a cartridge . Hand loaded . One done by her . To a shooter , that is as distinctive as a fingerprint . Once I knew it was her , I tried to stop her . I tried to talk her out of it at the motel , the night you saw me . Told her that this was a bad idea . That we were onto her . But I couldn 't bring myself to take her down . She saved my life more than once , Jaime . That ... That makes it a little hard to put a bullet in her . Why the hell should I believe any of what you 're saying ? Because I 'm asking you to . You gotta believe me on this one . I 'm trying to stop this thing , just as much as you are . I admit it . If Jonas thinks I 'm in on this , he probably had you feed me some false information about where Rudhan is sitting . He did . Jaime , that makes this guy an open target . We cannot allow him to die on American soil . You take the President , and I 'll take the tower . And they 're off . The horses have reached the back stretch . Setting the pace slightly , followed by Leoni 's Flower . Samantha Cap coming up on the outside . Prescott trying to squeeze through on the rail . And it 's Leoni 's Flower moving to challenge Samantha Cap for second . And coming into the final turn , it 's Imari Victory ahead by five ... Yes . Cover the windows ! Cover the windows ! Secure the President ! Everybody down ! Get him on the move ! Now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Julianne , stop ! A person doesn 't see what we saw back in ' 02 and forget it . Torture , executions . You 've been working private sector ops too long . But then , you were always good at walking away from things . Look , I didn 't walk away from you . I had to complete the mission . You know that . Well , now I 'm going to finish my own little mission . Take the shot , Antonio . Shut up , Sommers . You should have listened to her . So she was the one who broke your heart . Sir , you need to keep this on . I had to get out . It was too intense . She always had more nerve than I did . I should have never left her alone in Africa . Don 't ever let that happen to you , Jaime . It 's not easy to live with . I should have had her back . We 're losing him . Clear . Negative . Charge again . 162 . Clear . First time 's the worst . What happened ? I can 't do this . I 'm not cut out for this . Hey . Hey . Come on .

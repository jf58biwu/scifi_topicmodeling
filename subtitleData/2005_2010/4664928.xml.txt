 it felt like something was amiss . I felt compelled to cheer for the losing team . I had the feeling that Haruhi was about to cause a commotion again . 282 ) \ frz ( 349 ) \ blur1 } Incoming : Suzumiya Haruhi How did I know that ? the phone . You don 't have to tell me . I know . right ? We 're all meeting in front of the station at exactly 2 o 'clock . Make sure you come ! I didn 't even get to say a thing . What ? I forgot to tell you what to bring . Bring your swimming gear and lots of money ! And make sure you go there on a bike . Over ! No thanks . for some odd reason I have this feeling that I knew exactly what Haruhi was going to say . that 's not it . I get the feeling that the exact same thing had happened before . Is this what they call " deja vu " ? huh ? 385 ) } Endless Eight Kyon ! You need to show more enthusiasm ! yeah . Sorry for making you guys wait . I just got here too . let 's go ! To where ? of course ! I guess we would be . we should have summer activities like what other people do in the summer ! you know ? That 's why we 're doing this right now . This is our once-in-a-lifetime freshman summer vacation ! we 're going to the pool by bike . Tell me you guys brought your bikes too . No . You and I are the only ones who brought bikes . Kyon ? You can 't lose to Koizumi-kun . commence take off ! Here I go you guys ! We came here to have fun ! Why are you two worn out already ? Whose fault do you think it is ? Whose ? ! the smell of chlorine ! This is what it 's all about ! Hurry up and get in ! The water is nice and warm ! Can 't she see the signs that say " No Diving " ? doesn 't it ? It 's quite a pleasant scene . it 's peaceful . Don 't you think Suzumiya-san may have found a normal way of enjoying things ? and then hung up on me after stating her one-sided demands . You can 't exactly say that 's normal . Really now . I 'll gladly do it . there shouldn 't be anything happening that will endanger the world . If only that were true ... What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's probably just my imagination . We 've been through all sorts of things since spring . I think I might have become a little neurotic . It 's hot ! It 's hot ! It 's hooooot ! it 'd be more appropriate to call this place a " pool for the masses " than a " pool for the public " . Why did Haruhi choose this kind of place anyway ? I 'm getting that feeling again . I feel like I 've seen this somewhere before . Nagato looks like she 's bored . Kyon ! That 's right . Then Haruhi said something like ... These two are my brigade members . They 'll listen to everything I say . So ask them anything ! let 's go have fun ! We 're going to play water soccer ! okay . I guess . Mikuru-chan ! Okay ! I came up with an action plan for the rest of summer . What do you think ? All of this in less than two weeks . do you have anything you want to do ? I would like to scoop up goldfish . Okay ! Goldfish scooping it is . Excuse me . Thanks . We 'll start tomorrow . I wonder if there 's an Obon festival being held near here . A fireworks festival would be nice too . I 'll look into it . Don 't forget the goldfish scooping ! after all . Understood . I 'm the one paying again ... that 's it for today ! That 's it for me too . Me too . Nagato ! no . It 's nothing really ... How 've you been feeling lately ? You okay and everything ? I 'm okay . That 's great . Yes ... Why ? Why did I call out to her ? The next morning . from Haruhi . We 've figured out where they 're going to have the Obon festival : Tonight at the public sports ground . { was " Civic Stadium " in the previous ep though = / } We 're going to buy yukatas together ! and then immediately proceeded to drag them into the changing rooms . the three of them finally returned . they look great on you girls . after all . Especially Mikuru-chan ! It 's so cute ! Just what I 'd expect from myself ! Y-Yes it is ... Turning red triples your cuteness ! huh ? It attracts quite the crowd . so why do I get the feeling that I 've been here just recently ? That stage ... That food stall ... Mikuru-chan ! They have the goldfish scooping that you wanted to do over there ! Let 's scoop non-stop ! Okay . Shall we do the same ? How about a little competition ? I 'll pass . do you want to get something to eat ? You 're interested in that stuff ? Which do you want ? It 's all right . This . Sure ! That 's 800 yen . but ... we had a huge catch today ! Huge ! But we just took one because we didn 't need all of them . And another one for Mikuru too . so it was a bit hard . } Thanks . what 's with the mask ? I bought it . really . Right ! Fireworks are next ! Fireworks ! Let 's do that to finish the day off ! Haven 't you ever heard of the saying " Don 't bite off more than you can chew " ? there 's summer vacation . but I came to realize something . We 'll go bug catching tomorrow . but have you finished your homework ? What 're you talking about ? I finished all of that in three days . Three days ? ! Finish off all that tedious stuff so you can actually enjoy yourself . That 's the right way to enjoy summer ! Why is this person so smart ? matched the last 4 lines with ep 2 } Everyone ! We 're catching bugs tomorrow ! The person who catches the most will be Brigade Chief for one day ! No thanks . Sounds interesting . So it counts as long as it 's any kind of bug ? umm ... Cicadas only ! That 's right . This will be the SOS Brigade 's ... Cicada Catching Competition ! we got what you could call a ridiculously nice day . { We actually ignored the Nihon-bare part in the previous episode . Not sure if you want to leave that in . We used " ridiculously nice day " instead . } but ... the winner was Haruhi . We should go with a " catch-and-release " mentality . They might repay us with a favor in the future . And what exactly can a cicada do for us ? go back to the mountains ! it felt like we were opening Pandora 's Box . Welcome ! and ended up handing out balloons in front of a supermarket as a small part-time job . Thanks for your work everyone ! Why are being we treated like slaves ? { lit. what 's with this kind of treatment ? } Good job ! The manager was really grateful ! I don 't need the old man 's gratitude . Where 's our pay ? This is it . What ? I 've wanted this for a while now ! I no forgive you ! " } { Uncle issue resolved } You made us do all that work just for the sake of getting that ? Let 's decorate the clubroom with this in commemoration ! you can wear it whenever you feel like it . I give you my permission ! That night . My slumber was once again stolen away by none other than a phone call . Damnit . Kyon-kun ... Asahina-san ? it 's me . Something bad has ... If this goes on ... I 'll ... Um ... Koizumi . Why are you together with Asahina-san ? A slight problem has occurred . Do you think you could come here right now ? I 'll be there immediately . Where ? Asahina-san ? Kyon-kun ... { Do we need this UUUUUUU shit ? . } I ... I can 't go back to the future anymore ! that 's what happened . We 're currently looping through the same period of time over and over again . you said that quite cheerfully . do you have any idea what you 're saying ? I do . There 's nothing more to it . I was talking to Asahina-san just now . Call me up too ! For that sort of meeting . { Re-TLC PLEASE } { Re-TLC 'd } I happened to notice that the flow of time has felt strange lately . Asahina-san was the one who discovered it . I was able to confirm something . Confirm what ? We 're experiencing a repeat of the same time over and over again . You told me that already . the loop occurs from August 11th to August 31st . It 's an endless summer . The world now has lost all time past September 1st . That 's the reason why Asahina-san is unable to return to the future . I guess that 's only natural . What part of physics argues that a state of " No Future " is natural ? Who the hell would believe that ? at least . I 'll give you an explanation too ... I use * classified information * to communicate with the future and do things dealing with * classified information * . so I thought : This is strange ... And then * classified information * . so I did * classified information * out of panic but it was completely * classified information * ... I ... Why ? { Let 's considering putting classified information in square brackets } I have no idea . Was she just using the term " classified information " as a replacement for censoring words ? Are we trapped inside something similar to an enclosed space ? that 's not the case . One part of the time continuum has just been cut up . everything will be reset at exactly 2400 hours and we will return to August 11th again . That 's the process . the memories belonging to the entire human race ? That also gets reset . Everything starts over from the beginning again . huh ? since people from the future are involved with this . No . This one has nothing to do with Asahina-san . Then who 's the cause of this ? Probably Suzumiya-san . but ... a part of her might not want summer to end . What the hell ? Does she have some sort of regret ? I believe so . It may very well be the fact that she feels like she still has something she needs to do during summer vacation . small issue into galactic proportions . So what do you want me to do ? I would have already resolved it . You 're too close . I 've been thinking this for a while now aren 't you ? aren 't you ? I 've finally managed to solve the riddle of deja vu being left as imprints from past loops . Now that I think about it I 've come to understand that the imprints are simply what you would call the remains of a memory reset . Are you telling me that everyone else in the world feels it too ? It doesn 't look like it . You and I are special cases . Just by being close to Suzumiya-san we 've become the only ones capable of feeling it . What about Haruhi ? She isn 't the least bit aware of this fact ? It doesn 't look like it at all . It would probably be a lot more complicated if she did . with the deja vu I 'm thinking that there must be someone who has retained all of his or her memories of the repeated time . And who would that someone be ? I think you 'll know without me having to say it . It 's Nagato-san . Being outside the constraints of space and time the Integrated Data Sentient Entity most likely knows the most . Is this true ? Yes . Do you remember everything ? Yes . how many times have we been " reset " ? four hundred and ninety eighth time we 've had this discussion . four hundred and ninety eight ? 498 ? what are you talking about ? Are you being serious ? Yes . So we did the same thing over and over again each and every one of those times ? That is not necessarily the case . 498 times 391 of those times . we went twice . Obon minus the goldfish scooping occurred 437 times . 025 times . Among which there have been six variations - that 's enough . 498 times . That 's what Nagato said . about 594 years . living it over and over again while retaining her memories ? just how does it feel to have lived through all of this ? I ended up hearing something ridiculous again . The next day was stargazing . The venue was the rooftop of Nagato 's apartment . Koizumi prepared the telescope . I wonder if they 're there ? What ? Martians . I don 't really want them to exist . It looks like there 's no one on the surface . They might just be a timid people that live underground . They 're probably a friendly bunch . There 's no way that could happen . The day humans first set foot on Mars they 'll definitely come out of their caves and welcome humans as a surprise . They 'll say " Welcome to Mars ! " or something . Sounds like it 'd be mistaken for an attack . this is boring . Let 's look for UFOs ! anyway ? I wonder . this problem will be relatively straightforward to solve . Why don 't we try this out for starters ? Suddenly hug Suzumiya-san from behind and whisper in her ear : " I love you " . And who 's doing that ? There 's no one more suitable than you ! I 'll have to exercise my right to veto ! I 'll pass on this one ! Shall I do it then ? I 'm just kidding . I 'm not qualified for that role . I would only put Suzumiya-san into an unnecessary state of confusion . The next place we went to was the batting center . Nagato . Even before you talked to Asahina-san right ? Yes . So why did you keep quiet about it ? My mission is to observe . I see . The string of vigorous summer vacation events continued . And we continued to be carried away along with them . so I didn 't make any effort to do anything . August 30th arrived . we 've pretty much completed our summer plans . I wonder if it 's okay like this ? But ... I guess that 's it . do any of you want to do anything else ? Fine . so it 's probably enough . No . This isn 't fine . You aren 't supposed to be satisfied yet ! let 's call it a day then . I 'll let you have tomorrow off to prepare for school . Let 's meet in the club room the day after tomorrow . Haruhi ! This again ... Deja vu ! And this feels stronger than before . I can 't let Haruhi go home like this ! all those ten thousand something weeks will just end up being repeated again ! But what should I do ? What should I say ? There should be hints in Haruhi 's words ! But what are they ? What did she say until now ? I don 't know . I can 't remember ... August 31st . Homework : unfinished . I don 't care anymore . happens . doing this homework would be meaningless . Even if we happen to get to tomorrow ... I 'll just have to leave it to myself to figure out later .

 ( 4400-S3E01-The New World ) ( mysterious theme playing ) We 're not a threat . We 're salvation . The world will have to deal with us . TOM : Previously on The 4400 : JARVIS : What ? So Navarro was really some kind of mind reader ? I believe " telepath " is the word you 're looking for . Just concentrate on what you wanna ask me , and I 'll hear you . He definitely knew what we were thinking . DIANA : I can think of a few practical applications for it . You should 've come to me first . I 'd have treated you better than they ever will . We 're at war here . Don 't pick the losing side . There 's a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 . They call it promicin inhibitor . NTAC 's been studying the 4400 ever since they got back . They should 've known . They do know . I was ordered to work on a drug to suppress the production of promicin . Once I synthesized the inhibitor , we gave it to every 4400 . But if it comes down to a choice between the safety of the American people and the welfare of the 4400 , Tom ... that 's no choice at all . 'Cause if you 're holding on to any hope of keeping this covered up , you 'll have to start by putting me in the ground right here , right now . MARCO : Every male in this building has got a gallon of adrenaline coursing through his veins right now , and most of them are armed . A 4400 nearly took down a fortified government facility , and walked away without breaking a sweat . I-I wasn 't pregnant when I was abducted ... but I was when I got back . RICHARD : You 've seen what she 's capable of , what she can do when she feels threatened . But you know Isabelle has connections between the right and left hemispheres of her brain that have never been seen before . MICHAEL : You are the stewards of the future . Your daughter is the Rosetta stone for understanding what happened to the 4400 . Isabelle ? ( gasps ) Isabelle . Hello , Shawn . I 'm Isabelle . ( dramatic theme playing ) RYLAND : The world has changed . Everything is different now . The Promicin Inhibitor Program was an international effort . Its goal was to prevent the coming of a world dominated by a tiny fraction of the population . In short , we were doing everything we could to prevent the 4400 from developing extra-human capabilities . We believe that without the inhibitor program , these abilities would show up in virtually every single one of the 4400 . I don 't think I need to explain to this committee why that would be something less than the best-case scenario . Overnight , normal human beings like you and I , and all the institutions we 've come to rely on , would be obsolete . ( mysterious theme playing ) The program wasn 't perfect . People got sick . Some died . That was not our intent . But now ... it 's gone . And the future that we were trying to prevent is here . And we are not ready . I believe it comes down to a question of power . Who is going to hold it ? Us ... or them ? Because , believe me ... it 's going to come down to us against them . ( tense theme playing ) Shawn , you 're not making any sense . Tell me what 's wrong with Isabelle . I told you , I can 't explain . I-i-is she sick ? I-is she hurt ? Gotta see for yourself . Dad . Uh- - Uh- - Who the hell is this ? Where 's Isabelle ? I am your daughter . I 'm Isabelle . ( laughs ) I- - I don 't get it . It 's not a joke . Something happened . I- - I changed . I don 't know how . She just walked in here . She knew my name . She seems to know about you and Lily- - Stop . I don 't know what game you 're playing here ... and I don 't care . Richard . Richard . ( slow , moody theme playing ) Lily . Lily ! Lily ? Is Isabelle with you ? Lily ? Lil- - ( groaning ) Lily . Are you all right ? Oh , Richard . I must 've fainted . Is Isabelle with you ? Who are you ? Where 's my wife ? Richard . What are you talking about ? Uh- - I 'm Lily , your wife . Why are you looking at me like- - ? Oh , my God . Ma 'am , I don 't know who you are . Oh . Oh . Oh , my God . Oh . ( groans ) No ! Your blood pressure ... is elevated . But ... I suppose that 's to be expected . Heart , lungs , reflexes . All within the normal range . Doctor , you call this normal ? Richard , I wanna see Isabelle . Where is my daughter ? She 's right outside . I 'll bring her in . I realize how alarming this must be . But at least you can take some solace in the fact that your wife is a perfectly healthy older woman . If I had to guess , I 'd say she 's about 75 . I 'm 29 . And I don 't understand . Please help me understand . How could this happen ? M-maybe it 's a reaction to being taken off the promicin inhibitor . But truthfully , I don 't know . There is a condition called progeria . It 's associated with rapid aging . So ... this kind of thing has happened before ? Mr. Tyler ... when your wife fainted this morning , she was a young woman . When she woke up less than a minute later , she was 50 years older . I can guarantee you ... this is a first . Excuse me . Oh . Are you okay , Dr. Burkhoff ? I 'm fine . Not enough sleep , that 's all . Research . Well , what do we do now ? Is there any way to- - To reverse this ? ( sighs ) I wish I knew . I need ... to do some thinking . ( knock on door ) ( door opens ) Are you my mother ? Isabelle ? ( sad theme playing ) Every day , the 4400 are changing and getting stronger . Instead of mobilizing to meet this challenge , we 're wringing our hands and trying to determine who knew what when . I will save this committee the trouble and expense of a long investigation . The inhibitor program was my idea . I was proud to lead it . The men on this board were simply following my orders . If there 's blame to be assigned ... it 's mine . Mine alone . Yeah , I know Kyle doesn 't wanna see me . Is there some way we can force him to ? I 'm his father . I wanna know how he 's doing . Look , I realize you 're trying , but it 'll be months before he goes to trial , and I 'm not gonna wait that long . Do you think people are gonna let Ryland position himself as some kind of patriotic martyr ? The man headed a conspiracy that caused 28 deaths . Well , he says it was accidental . A significant percentage of this country believes him . Try overwhelming . You guys listen to talk radio lately ? I mean , the calls are , like , 90 percent in his favor . You can buy a " Free Dennis Ryland " T-shirt within a block . Maybe they should put him up for the Nobel Peace Prize . Just- - Just tell him I need to see him . We don 't have to talk about the case . I just have to see my son . Just ask him one more time , okay ? And ... And tell him we love him . Give him some time , Thomas . Kyle needs to live with his choice for a while . ( bell chimes ) We 're back . ( crowd chattering ) Tom ... break 's over . ( tense theme playing ) ( gavel bangs ) Ladies and gentlemen , I 'd like to call the proceedings to order . Everyone , just take your seats so we can get started . Members of the press , I was including you in that " ladies and gentlemen " ... designation , thank you . Mr. Ryland ... I 'd like to pick up the questioning where we left off . You insist that you alone gave the go-ahead for the Promicin Inhibitor Program , is that right , sir ? Yes , sir . It was my program all the way . So this committee is to understand that your department was able to plan and implement an international conspiracy without some Cabinet-level approval ? That 's correct . I was given a broad mandate in my duties as head of NTAC . I felt that the project fell within that mandate . So there was no need to seek outside approval- - ( feedback screeching ) ( people gasping ) COMMITTEE HEAD : Excuse us , everybody . Did you hear that ? Well , yeah , the microphones went haywire . No , no , no , not that . Something else . Just set that approval issue to the side for the moment . Did you ever discuss the project ... ( groans ) ... with anyone outside of NTAC ? I mean , someone , somewhere must have taken an interest in what your people were doing over there . Listen to me . What ? What 's wrong ? A simple question , Mr. Ryland . Surely , it can 't be that difficult to answer . If I could have your attention up here , Mr. Ryland . You need to relax , Miles . ( eerie theme playing ) Oh ! ( crowd gasping ) ( grunts ) GUARD : Security ! Stop that man ! ( screams ) ( cameras clicking , screams ) Get some protection on Ryland . Stay here . I 'll be right back . GUARD 2 : We need an ambulance ! Someone call an ambulance ! Stand back , please . Back . Back . ( suspenseful theme playing ) Hey ! ( grunts ) Stop ! T.J. ! ( grunts ) ( tires screeching ) Someone get these photographers out of here . You need to stay with them . I don 't understand what I did . Would somebody please tell me what I just did ? Hang on , Dennis . The ambulance is coming . Yeah , it was her . Blood we picked up at the scene matches the DNA in our records . That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse . When she hit this place , T.J. drove every man in the building into a homicidal rage . Now it sounds like she just zapped one guy . She 's learning to control what she can do . They all are . Ever since we took them off the inhibitor , they 're either developing new abilities , or they 're refining the ones that they 've got . So they are getting more dangerous . I guess Ryland was right . I 'll be sure to mention that to my daughter . Okay , save the point-counterpoint . At the moment , we 've been tasked with two jobs . We track down T.J. Kim . What 's the second job ? We are to protect Ryland 's co-conspirators from any further reprisals . So we arrest them , and now we 're their bodyguards ? Well , the entire country just saw a 4400 turn a government hearing into her own personal slasher film . If T.J. gets to Ryland again , or any of them , before we can bring her in , people are gonna start to wonder if the U.S. government is capable of protecting its citizens . And that 's the beginning of chaos . Back to work , please . ( people murmuring ) Tom . In case you 're wondering ... Dennis is still in surgery . They say that it is touch-and-go . ( tense theme playing ) ( whispering ) ( Lily panting ) SHAWN : It 's okay . Give me your hands . Try and relax . Relax . ( crickets chirping , wind blowing ) Is it better ? ( sighs ) Much better . ( sighs ) For now . When this thing first came on , it was bad , but at least she was healthy . Now she 's had diabetes , emphysema . Seems like every day there 's something new . I 'll come help her every day . Listen , we got everyone working on this . We 're gonna figure it out . Is my mother okay ? Uh , yeah . Uh ... She had a little problem . Shawn fixed it . It 's all in the wrists . ( chuckles ) Can I see her ? Please ? ( quiet theme playing ) Mom ? Mm . Isabelle . Come here . Is there anything I can do ? No , I 'm- - I 'm fine . Really . Sit down . You were such a beautiful baby . I used to hold you all day long . I knew exactly what you were feeling , what you wanted . We were so close . I 'm sorry for growing up so fast . I didn 't mean to . I didn 't want to . Neither did I. ( slow , mysterious theme playing ) TOM : Crazy thing is , I keep thinking about Patty ... Ryland 's wife . Feel like I should call her or something , help her through this . Maybe you should . You and Ryland were friends for a long time . It 's okay to be conflicted . Yeah , well , Ryland 's little experiment almost got you killed . Shawn too . The guy knew that Kyle was stalking Jordan Collier , and he did nothing . I 'd say that trumps friendship . You have so much on your mind : Kyle , Ryland , the 4400s . I need to get you away from here , away from your problems . Yeah , well , it sounds nice . But I can 't go anywhere . Starting investigation in the morning . What if I told you I could take you away between now and then ? My ability . Since I 'm off the inhibitor ... I think I can control it now . What , you mean you wanna- - ? You wanna take me into another dream world ? Alternate rea- - ? I don 't know what to call it . Call it a vacation . A week . A year . As long as we want . All that in the space of a few moments . Should we try it ? Well- - Wha- - Right here ? Now ? ( stammers ) What do we do ? We 're already doing it . ( mysterious theme playing ) ( birds chirping ) There 's no one on the beach . It 's all ours , Thomas . So is the hotel . We can stay here for as long as we like . And there is no jet lag . Mm . That sounds perfect . It is perfect too . Mm . ( knock on door ) The door 's open . Come in . Whoa . What ? What is it ? Uh- - You 're naked . I 'm more comfortable this way . Haven 't really gotten used to them . Clothes . I ... have a bathrobe . Is this better ? Almost . Just- - ( slow , mysterious theme playing ) Never met anybody that read the encyclopedia from cover to cover before . Oh . I 'm not finished . I just delivered those to you yesterday . Okay , you 're a fast reader . That 's really cool . Um , listen . They 're looking for you down in the labs . You 're like an hour late . They sent you to get me ? Aren 't you in charge ? Well , yeah , more or less . You know , I go where I 'm needed . They were scared of me , weren 't they ? Pretty much . That 's all right . I think even my parents are frightened of me . I don 't think your mom and dad are scared of you . I ... think they 're just confused . I don 't blame them . It 's mostly how I feel too . I ... don 't understand what happened to me . I don 't understand what happened to my mother . And I 'm trying to read and learn things , but ... mostly , I just- - ( sighs ) I still feel lost . See , now you sound like a real 4400 . But I 'm not a 4400 . Not like my mother and father ... or you . RYLAND : Looks like I 'm gonna live . Sorry to disappoint you , Tom . Why did you ask to see me , Dennis ? I hear that you and Skouris are in charge of the investigation . Yeah . We know who did it . We 'll find her . T.J. Kim attacked this building six weeks ago . No one 's tracked her down yet ? We got a little sidetracked cleaning up your mess , Dennis . Did you ever think that maybe she has help ? Other 4400s ... who feel the same way about the government she does ? When we catch her , we 'll ask . Will you ? I wanna make sure you 're gonna take this thing as far as it goes , Tom . The same way you did when you came after me . And ... I want my people protected . They were acting under my orders . They 're under guard . So was the courthouse when Kim attacked . I 'd feel better ... if you brought them in . We offered sanctuary to every single conspirator . There were no takers . I guess no one wanted to cooperate with the organization that was working to put you in prison . We had to fight just to get them to let us post agents outside their houses . Crocket . Are you ready to go for a walk , boy ? Come on , Crocket . Let 's go . They wanted no part of us . They all seemed confident that T.J. Kim was acting alone . ( intense theme playing ) ( Crocket growling ) ( barking ) Crock ? What 's wrong ? It 's me . ( growling ) ( grunts ) ( screaming ) ( mysterious theme playing ) JARVIS : This just arrived 15 minutes ago . MAN ( voice distorted ) : This is a message from the Nova Group . We are the defensive wing of the 4400 . Today , the world has seen what happens to those who try to harm us . A second demonstration of our capabilities is planned for October 19th . A new era dawns . MARCO : Defensive wing , huh ? What happens when they decide to play offense ? I guess we find out in five days . They didn 't even say what they want . No demands , no room for compromise . We don 't even know how many 4400s are in this ... Nova Group . We couldn 't handle one when she walked in and attacked . Now there 's a whole team of assassins out there , all with abilities ? They got someone who can kill you by lowering your body temperature . Don 't forget the beast master . What ? That dog got pissed off pretty quick . Well , I 've been all over the files , and none of these abilities have been registered with us . They 're off the inhibitor now . We can 't even pretend to have a comprehensive list of what these people can do . Is anyone else feeling , uh ... a little overmatched here ? ( suspenseful theme playing ) You two remember Gary Navarro ? Hey , Gary . Been a while . You 're right , Baldwin . I do think you two sold me out . It really bothered me for a while , but now I understand it 's just standard operating procedure . Well , I guess that mind-reading thing 's working pretty well ? Uh , better than ever , actually . Gary 's telepathic abilities have been very useful to the National Security Agency . They have agreed to let us borrow him while we investigate the Nova Group . You 're clear on what we 're doing ? You want to use a 4400 to track down other 4400s . Do you have a problem with that ? Not at all . It won 't be my first time . So ... can we get started ? SHAWN : Never heard of the Nova Group . Not until this morning , anyway . Now I gotta go on television in an hour and explain that the Center had nothing to do with this . Shawn . I know there 's a lot of history between NTAC and this place . But I trust you realize how serious this is . Believe me ... if I knew anything , I would tell you . Well , do you mind if the three of us walk around the place , talk to some people ? You and your pet mind reader ? No , I can 't let you do that . These people haven 't done anything wrong . I won 't let you invade their privacy . And I actually can 't believe that you brought this guy here again . How much do they pay you to spy on your own kind ? Are you getting a clear signal ? See anything you like up there ? As far as I can tell , he 's not hiding anything . I have a lot of work to do . If I hear anything , I 'll give you a call . For now , that 's the best I can do . ( mysterious theme playing ) Sorry about my nephew . Why ? Well , he was kind of rude back there . I get that kind of stuff a lot . I don 't take it personally . DIANA : Do you mind if I ask you- - ? Uh , you 've sort of implied that you 've pursued 4400s in the past . What exactly do you do for the NSA ? Overseas stuff , mostly . But like what ? Give me an example . They fly me someplace . I approach the subject , find out what he 's thinking . And I tell the people I work for ... who then fly me home , where I live comfortably . What happens to the subject ? I don 't ask . ( dark theme playing ) ( starts car ) BURKHOFF : That 's good . The neural pathway comparisons are particularly illuminating . Make sure you understand them before you move on . Yeah- - Dr. Burkhoff . I don 't understand any of this . A bunch of her neurons don 't work anymore . Every time one of hers turns off , one of mine turns on . Exactly . And what 's true for neurons is true for muscle fibers , synaptic pathways . There is ... a one-to-one ... correspondence between the amount you lost and the amount you gained . So all this is just a way of saying I 'm doing this to her ? BURKHOFF : Correlation is too precise to be random . Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging . How do we stop it ? Put me back the way I was ? Oh , I-I 'm afraid I can 't . So , what do we do about it ? BURKHOFF : There is a possibility that if the aging agent were eliminated , that Lily might be restored to her normal self . The aging agent ? He means me . I 'm killing you . The only way for you to live is for me to die . Isn 't that right ? Don 't answer that , Dr. Burkhoff . Thank you for your time , but ... we 're done here . Where are you going ? ( gasps ) We 're not discussing this . Not now . Not ever . ( tense theme playing ) It 's true , isn 't it ? I think so . ( sniffles ) But it 's only a theory . Guys , I went over this six weeks ago with the men in black . Humor us . I went on two dates with T.J. Kim . Then I cut it off . Girl had a lot of baggage . How long ago was that ? Uh , uh- - Uh , two months ago . And if I 'd known there would be government agents showing up every other day to ask me about her , I would 've taken notes . Hey , so listen ... All this stuff about October 19th , you guys think it 's serious ? I mean , should I be getting out of town ? I don 't think that 's the answer . As far as we know , you 're as safe here as anywhere else . That kid was lying . Or at least he wasn 't telling you everything . The whole time you were talking to him , he was thinking about an address . 331 Reynolds Avenue . ( dramatic theme playing ) Looks like it 's clear . Nobody 's home . Nobody 's been home for a while , I 'd say . Look at this . It 's the government report on the return of the 4400 . I tried to read this once . Kind of dry . Mm . Well , it looks like someone made it right through to the end . " Wesley Hauser . " " Wesley Hauser . Wesley Hauser . " Who the hell is Wesley Hauser ? JARVIS : Hauser was a Marine . Did two tours of duty in Vietnam . He led protests against the war after he got home in ' 72 . Disappeared in ' 75 . Once he got out of quarantine , he never checked back in . Guy 's been living off the grid for almost two years . Which means he never went on the inhibitor . So who knows what he 's capable of by now . TOM : Hauser was disillusioned with the government before disappearing . We haven 't done much to win him over since he 's been back . When he was in quarantine , he was housed in barracks three , same building as T.J. Kim . An agitator . An organizer . A radical . Sounds like we have our second member of the Nova Group . ( phone rings ) Baldwin . You 're kidding me . All right . All right . I know . Put him through . Says he 's Wesley Hauser . No way . Yeah , hello ? MAN : How did you like my apartment ? Well , to be honest , it felt a little empty without you there . I 'm on a tight schedule . Lot to do before next week . Sounds like you have interesting plans . Why don 't we get together someplace , talk them over ? No more talking . There 's nothing to say . Your time is ending . Ours begins October 19th . ( dial tone hums ) Come on , let me go . Why 'd you run when we asked you about Hauser ? You two used to eat together in quarantine . We 've got it on camera . So ? The guy had a lot of good war stories . Doesn 't make us best friends . So why did you run ? Because when I see NTAC agents , I run the other way . You people almost killed us all . Can you blame me ? Turn around . Turn around . Are we done here ? Get out of here . I mean , call me sensitive , but ... I felt like saying to him , " We exposed the inhibitor . We saved your life . " ( laughing ) You guys ... just don 't really get it , do you ? It 's not just that guy . Every 4400 we 've talked to today , they 're scared of you . Or they don 't trust you . Or they hate you . Look , I 'm sorry , but the days when you could expect friendly conversation from these people , they 're gone . You 're the bad guys now . Get used to it . ( slow , moody theme playing ) ( distant siren wails ) ( gasps ) Now , I 'm just warning you , motherhood 's no cakewalk . Since when are you an expert ? Heh . I 'm only saying she landed on twins . Kind of a big responsibility . Especially when she 's trying to get by on a teacher 's salary . What are you gonna name ' em ? I don 't really want to play anymore . Is that okay ? Oh , what 's wrong , sweetheart ? Nothing . Except I know Marco 's gonna win , I 'm gonna come second , and you 're gonna end up alone with no money . Don 't be jealous . He 's smarter than you ... but Mom likes you better . ( sighs ) ( door closes ) So , uh ... ( claps hands ) ... who 's- - Who 's smarter than me ? Who knows ? I 'm not even sure she knows exactly . You know , in some ways she was better off on the promicin inhibitor . At least she wasn 't overwhelmed back then . All she wants to do is record what she sees in those notebooks . It 's like some kind of compulsion . Huh ? Well ... think about it for a minute . Every morning she wakes up , and ... knows pretty much what 's coming . She 's already lived the whole day once in her head . By the time something actually does happen ... it 's like a rerun . I hate watching reruns . Yeah . Try living one . ( pours drink ) Hey , what about Kevin Burkhoff ? Maybe he can figure out a way for Maia to control her visions . And he 's brilliant . I don 't say this about many people ... but he is smarter than me . ( knock on door ) I know you . Well , of course you do . It 's Diana Skouris . You work at NTAC . I 'm not here on business though . I 'm- - I 'm here about my daughter , Maia . The precog . What about her ? She 's still 10 , right ? She 's not 65 now , is she ? Interesting guess . Kind of wide of the mark though . Good . ( unhooking chains ) Might as well come on in . Thank you . Oh . Sorry about the clutter . ( chuckles ) : That 's okay . I fired the maid last week . She was always cleaning . ( mysterious theme playing ) Excuse me . So ... uh , your daughter ... what 's troubling her ? ( mysterious theme playing ) ( gasps ) ( dramatic theme playing ) ( groans ) ( rattling ) ( groans ) I 'll let you do it . I caused all this , right ? And getting rid of me is the only way to save my mother . No . That 's what you were thinking ? Shh . No , it wasn 't . I don 't want her to die either . So I 'll let you do it . I 'll- - I 'll even shut my eyes . Isabelle ... I would never hurt you . Why ? I don 't understand . It 's the only way to save her . We don 't know that . And I won 't make a choice between the two of you . Won 't or can 't ? ( chatter ) Sorry . I , uh , don 't mean to invade anyone 's space . Oh , that 's okay . It 's not my desk . But it looks like you 'll be here for a while now , huh ? Assuming this place is still standing on October 20th , yeah . Maybe we should talk to Jarvis . Get you a room of your very own . Well , that 's fine with me . Hm . To tell you the truth , I could use a ... little bit of a buffer zone . This , uh , problem you 're having with your daughter 's , uh ... precog ability . I keep wanting to give you my opinion . But I don 't want to intrude . So you are ... listening to my thoughts . Ah . You and Baldwin . I can 't help it . Um ... I try to tune you guys out , but ... every now and then something leaks through . I 'll try to keep that in mind . You said you had an opinion about Maia . What is it ? When I first , uh ... developed this thing of mine ... I was a basket case . You saw me . I truly thought I was going insane . So I , uh- - I fought against it . And that just made it worse . I had to give in to it ... let it take control of me . And then slowly , I learned how to take control of it . Listen , your kid stops fighting , and eventually it 'll become like seeing , or hearing , or ... any other sense . She won 't even think about it . It 's just a part of who she is . Hm . That 's how it worked for me , anyway . Thank you . Diana , we just got a call from Seattle police . Someone down there read our APB . They know exactly where Hauser is . ( tense theme playing ) You guys are lucky , actually . In another day or two , we would 've buried him in the potter 's field . Buried who ? Him . I always read the APB memos when they circulate in the police department . Kind of a hobby . Gets boring in here . Anyway , there was a description of a regimental tattoo on the memo for Hauser . 82nd Airborne . " Death From Above . " I remember it from a John Doe they brought in here three weeks ago . This guy drowned in the harbor . Well , a lot of veterans have that tattoo . Do a lot of veterans look exactly like the mug shot you circulated ? Don 't believe me ? Take a look for yourselves . Say hello to Wesley Hauser . ( mysterious theme playing ) Hauser died two and a half weeks before Ryland was attacked . Obviously , that wasn 't him on the phone the other day . And that copy of the 4400 report with all his notes over it ? For all we know , that could 've been a plant . Somebody wanted us distracted . They deliberately put us on the trail of some phantom member of the Nova Group . How did we first find out about Hauser ? T.J. ' s old boyfriend gave us the address . No , he was thinking it . At least according to Gary he was . Gary Navarro put us on to Wesley Hauser . ( mysterious theme playing ) ( chatter ) Get in . You lied to me , Daniel . You never said anything about killing people . No , we were protecting you , Shawn . And if we tell you in advance , you 're culpable . ( woman moaning ) What is she doing here ? She 's dying . She needs your help . I told you , I don 't want anything more to do with you . The Nova Group was supposed to protect us . That 's why I gave you money , Daniel . That 's why I gave you money . Not to start a terrorist organization . We 'll talk about your concerns later . She 's got a stomach wound . It 's infected . She needs you right now or she 's not gonna make it . Shawn , she 's a 4400 . And if we don 't help each other , what hope do we have ? ( moaning ) Give me your hand . ( moans ) ( mysterious theme playing ) ( exhales ) ( thud ) ( muffled yelling ) ( heart monitor beeping ) What are you doing here ? You 're awake . Good . It 's important that you know it was me . I 'm the guy who killed you . ( gasping ) ( heart monitor beeping faster ) TOM ( over walkie-talkie ) : Med post , do you have a 20 on Gary Navarro ? Yeah . He just walked by . Why ? Get him . Hey . Stop ! Go . I 'll check on Ryland . He 's seizing . He 's bradying down . I need a crash cart and Ativan . Find Dr. Danoff . Now ! ( suspenseful theme playing ) Stay right there , Gary . RICHARD : Isabelle . Isabelle . Oh , God . Somebody call an ambulance ! ( quiet crying ) What 's everybody standing around for ? ! Somebody call an ambulance ! MAN : They 're on their way . ( gasps ) Somebody call an ambulance . Dad . ( gasps ) ( eerie piano theme playing ) ( crowd murmuring ) What am I ? ARMAND : It 's miraculous , Shawn . When I watch you heal someone , and ... well , it makes me wonder why they hate us so much . They hate us because you 're killing them , Daniel . They 're afraid of us . I can 't blame them . Uh- - You make it sound like we acted out of some sort of bloodlust . These were precise , tactical strikes , Shawn . And you and every other 4400 were ultimately much safer because of them . You killed people . That 's not what we discussed when you approached me . I gave you money to start a defensive arm for the Center , in case the government ever came after us again . It was a precaution . And all we 've done is taken precautionary measures . Shawn , do you think that because their inhibitor program was exposed that the government 's just gonna leave us in peace ? No . They know we 've gotten stronger , which threatens their hold on power , which increases their need to eliminate us . So we strike first ? Mm . Is that it ? Is that what happens on the 19th ? Now , look , Shawn . You do great work at that center of yours . Now you just focus on that . I don 't wanna distract you . Knowledge can be a burden . And thanks for helping T.J. out . You 're a hero to your own people . Don 't forget that . Yeah . ( starts car ) It did not work , you know . Ryland was OD 'ing , but the doctors pulled him out of it . He 'll be awake within a couple of hours . Well , I 'm sure you 're as disappointed as I am . Don 't worry . We 'll get him . DIANA : Let 's talk about Wesley Hauser . You first met him in quarantine . I liked Wes . Yeah , he was ten kinds of crazy , but his heart was in the right place . Uh , I guess he was , uh , bipolar or something , but he never took medication . After quarantine , he , uh- - He lived on the streets . I used to visit him down at the docks . You know , give him food , a little money . So when did you decide to kill him ? Ha . No , Wes , he didn 't need my help with that . He drank about three bottles of Mad Dog a day . One morning , about a month ago , I went down to see him , and , uh ... I found him by the dumpster ... dead . And somewhere in the middle of your grieving process , you figured he 'd make a handy decoy . No , Hauser wouldn 't have minded it . I mean , he hated people like you , going back to his Marine Corps days . So when I found him , I , uh- - I said a word or two over his body . And I pushed him into Elliot Bay . So how long you been working with this Nova Group ? Did someone approach you ? Was the whole thing your idea ? Tell me . Y-you and this girlfriend of yours ... Is it like a ... you know , a role-playing thing you get up to . Or is she actually taking you into these- - I don 't know , what do you call it ? - -fantasy worlds ? Oh , and this- - This- - This guy , Marco . Does he know that you 're too , uh ... embarrassed to tell your partner that you two been dating ? Done showing off ? Why don 't you tell us what 's gonna happen on October 19th ? I guess you 're gonna have to find yourself another telepath . ( eerie piano theme playing ) Good luck with that . So you got nothing out of him ? He told us about Hauser . But as far as the Nova goes , it 's gonna take time to break him down . How much time ? He 's a telepath . He knows what we 're thinking . Heh . Longer than usual . Okay . So it 's not easy . But Gary Navarro has a Level 7 security clearance . We have to assume that he 's been using it to funnel national secrets to the Nova Group . We need to know what he knows . Now . He 'll talk . Gary 's been inside our heads for a year . I think I know how to get inside of his . Careful with this . Just- - Matthew . Ah . I didn 't expect to see you back for a couple weeks . Nova Group provides my calendar for me . Wiped it clean , actually . It 's difficult to lobby on behalf of the 4400 when some of them are boasting about their body count . Suppose . How 's Lily ? Any improvement since I left ? If anything , she 's getting worse . Sorry to hear that . Isabelle ? She tried to kill herself this morning . She jumped off the roof . A few minutes later , she was walking around like nothing happened . I gotta tell you , Matthew- - I 'm not gonna lie - -I 'm really glad you 're back . ( eerie theme playing ) ( knock at door ) Hello , Isabelle . Hello . Who are you ? My name is Matthew Ross . I work closely with Shawn . I 'm an adviser to the 4400 . May I come in ? I understand there was an incident this morning . You attempted ... to harm yourself . I see . ( gasps ) You had no right to do that ! Don 't you understand who you are ? What you 're here to do ? ( cries ) : No . Well , I do ! I know everything about you . I know why you 're here . And I know what you 're supposed to do . ( gasps ) Sit . And I 'll tell you a story . You 'll like it . It 's about your past , and it 's about your future . DIANA : I know you went to a lot of trouble to get this . Thank you . But ... ? I 'm not sure I wanna send Maia to a school that only teaches 4400s . It sounds like a great way to get her to withdraw even further from the world . Look , just- - Just pretend it 's got nothing to do with the 4400 for a second . Uh- - It 's a good school . You know , topnotch faculty . The facilities are great . And it 's all free . Uh , the 4400 Center picks up the whole tab . I- - They even have a class on how to manage your abilities . Just give me some time to think about it , okay ? It 's a big step . I was kind of hoping Dr. Burkhoff would have , I don 't know , a magic pill or something . What 's he working on ? Anything interesting ? You know that promicin serum that he invented that saved everybody ? Well , I saw a syringe at his place , and it looked like there was some in it . Well , uh- - He 's a researcher , right ? He 's probably injecting into- - what ? - -mice ? Guinea pigs ? The only animals I saw at his place were a couple of cockroaches . Y-you don 't think he 's injecting it into himself , do you ? BURKHOFF : That 's ridiculous ! I am not injecting myself with the promicin serum . Good . I 'm glad to hear it . I 'm injecting myself with a ... modified version of the promicin serum . Dr. Burkhoff , I have to ask you this : ( claps hands once ) Have you stopped taking your medication ? Of course not . I 'm as sane as you are . ( coughing ) Once the course of treatment is finished , I will have taught my body how to produce ... promicin . And then I will be the first non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities . The first ... of many . You 're talking about the next step in human evolution . Do you think the world 's ready for that ? The world is never ready for change . You have to force it on them . Isn 't that why the 4400 were brought back ? Isn 't that why the future ... woke me up ? You shouldn 't be ... doing research of this magnitude in- - excuse me , but- - In a dump . These are hardly sterile working conditions . You could help me with that . You have a scientific background , right ? I have graduate degrees in microbiology and epidemiology . Good . That 'll be handy . I need someone to monitor my progress ... as the changes ... continue . Changes ? ( coughs ) I think it 's an exciting first step . Don 't you ? ( eerie theme playing ) ALANA : I was thinking , next time , we could make a world where Kyle never shot Jordan Collier , never went to prison , the inhibitor scandal never happened . Sounds nice . Although I have to tell you , at the moment , I 'm not really feeling a need to be transported to some kind of fantasy world . As long as this water stays hot , things are A-okay with me right ... here and now . Maybe tomorrow we can try it again . Oh , I 'll take a rain check . I 'm going to a seminar ... at the 4400 Center tomorrow . I-it 's about what we can expect physically now that we 're off the inhibitor . Well , is everything okay ? You 're not having any problems , are you ? No , I- - I feel fine . I 'm- - Feel great , actually . Well , then I don 't get it . Why do you need to go ? I don 't . I- - I wanna go . I 'm curious . But , Lana , you never- - You never wanted to go to the Center before . Why start now ? I never felt the need to be around ... other 4400s before . Now you do ? It 's just a seminar , Thomas . Yeah , okay . I get it . ( quiet , tense theme playing ) TOM : Do you recognize those names ? They 're 4400s . All of them foreign nationals . Alesandro Ortiz from Venezuela . Ismael Namir from Libya . Chitra Singh from Indonesia . They 've all gone missing in the past year . That 's one year . That 's about as long as you 've worked for the NSA , isn 't it , Gary ? We checked your travel records . You left Venezuela two days before Ortiz disappeared . Same thing in Libya , Indonesia . Everyone on that list . You were there . They went away . DIANA : What exactly did you do for the NSA , Gary ? There 's an arms race going on , isn 't there ? Only now it 's with 4400s . These people- - I bet their abilities make the wrong people very nervous . DIANA : And the NSA couldn 't stand by while foreign and potentially hostile governments developed what , human weapons of mass destruction ? Is this list complete , huh ? Because I 'm just wondering how many 4400s you did kill . I did not ... kill anyone . Oh , no , no , no . You got the right people in the right ZIP code because you were living back home . ( sighs ) What did he say ? Oh , yeah . " Very comfortably when the actual dirty work was done . " DIANA : And that 's why you went across to the Nova Group , isn 't it , Gary ? Because you just couldn 't live with yourself . The NSA ... told me that I was helping my country . They didn 't fill in the blanks . I had to do that myself . You felt used . They made you a weapon against your own people . So when did you figure it out ? I- - ( door buzzes ) What 's up ? Who are these guys ? NINA : This is Agent Wood and Dr. Boll of the NSA . They 've been brought in to help expedite the interrogation . First of all ... no more sitting . TOM : What 's going on here ? Brought in by who ? RYLAND : Gary Navarro tried to kill me . I made a phone call . You should be in jail right now , Dennis . I still have a few friends , Tom . I had him talking . I was making progress . Not fast enough . The members of Gary 's cell know he 's been taken . They 're already changing their plans . If it takes too long to break him , the information he gives us is stale . October 19th is three days away . Yeah . I know you find this hard to believe , Tom ... but we are on the same side . We have the same goal . Those agents are tools . Use them . ( tense theme playing ) ( door opens ) You 're sitting in my spot . Sorry . It 's okay . There 's ... room for two people to sit . You 've got Stalin , Pol Pot and the Marquis de Sade ? Finish all the fun books ? Well , I 'm interested in learning more about evil . Everybody 's ... scared of me . So I thought , what if they 're right ? What if I 'm bad ? Why would you think that ? Sometimes , I think I feel it inside of me , like ... I could be capable of anything . Everyone 's capable of anything . Believe me , I know . How ? Have you done bad things ? Yeah , of course I have . Will you tell me about them ? Um ... okay . Slept with my brother 's girlfriend . How bad is that ? Some people would call that a major betrayal . Lot of hurt feelings . This man did much worse than that . Well , I 'm not a dictator . But ... I 've done the big kind of bad too . I can 't say much about it , but I gave some money to some people . They used it for something really , really wrong . And ... I don 't think that they 're finished . Well , can you stop them ? I could turn them in . The thing is , is so far , they 've only gone after bad people . People that tried to kill me . Tried to kill all of us . So if they 've only gone after bad people , then doesn 't that make them good ? Maybe . I don 't know . ( slow theme playing ) We 're relating now , aren 't we ? I read about this . Yeah . We are . How was it for you ? I liked it . We talked . It helped me understand good and evil . According to you , you get to pick ? It 's a choice . I have it right , don 't I ? Yeah , you do . I can 't open my hand . I woke up from a nap , it was all bunched up like this . Arthritis I can handle . Mm . Feels good . ( exhales ) You 're like a human heating pad . ( chuckles ) Mm . I like that . Human heating pad . I 'll take it as a compliment . Mm . Seriously , you better ? Yeah . RICHARD : I 've been trading e-mails with somebody down at the Mayo Clinic . He says we should go to Sweden and try this experimental treatment . ( water pours ) Here . Huh . What 's this ? Open it . ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) LILY : Can you believe that the Air Force lets you do that now ? You give them some money , and they let you ride along in an F-16 . It says here I get to take the controls . Oh , I talked to the guy who was in charge of the program , and I- - I told him about your background as a pilot . And he said he would let you drive for 30 seconds . Lily , I was a pilot in 1950 . That 's why it 's only 30 seconds . ( laughs ) Happy birthday , Richard . Oh . Thanks , but it 's not my birthday for another six weeks . Richard , I 'm not going to be here in six weeks . That 's not true . Yes , it is . You and I have both known for a while . Richard , I 'm dying . Lily ... I know how hard this is on you , but you can 't give up . Shawn said he 's willing to stay here with you all day if he has to . He 'll keep you healthy . He can 't . Not anymore . ( slow , moody theme playing ) MAIA : Are all these people 4400s ? Some are . Some just wish they were . Why would they want that ? Oh , good morning . Welcome to the Center . Are you a 4400 ? No , sweetie . Are you ? Well , it is an honor to meet you . Are you here to take our seminar ? No . We 're here to look at the school . We have an appointment with Ms. Tobey . I 'll get her right away . In the meantime , would you sign in and register your ability ? We 're creating a database . You sure you wanna do this ? I wanna meet kids like me . My name is Alana Mareva . I ... have to admit ... I was pretty hesitant about coming here today . I was lucky . My life was pretty much intact when I was returned . I never thought much about being a 4400 . But when ... we all got sick , and ... seeing everyone together in quarantine ... it made me feel like I had been denying a part of myself . So ... here I am . And I 'm glad I came . ( screams ) ( groaning ) ( dark theme playing ) Anything you wanna tell me ? Gary . ( panting ) ( sighs ) Let 's end this . I 'll let you sit down . Who contacted you first ? Just give me a name . Oh , man . ( screams , groaning ) So how about it ? October 19th is two days away . Now , you got something to tell me or not ? Suit yourself . ( screams ) ARMAND : One of our members has been compromised . I have to assume he 's gonna give up my name . SHAWN : What , so you call me ? For all I know , NTAC is monitoring this line . Well , we 're gonna have to go underground . It 's gonna cost money . You think I 'm just gonna write you a check ? You can arrange it however you want . I need it tomorrow . I will see you at the usual spot , at the usual time . We are in a war ... and we all have to do our part . ( moaning , sobbing ) ( tense theme playing ) WOOD : Talk to me , Gary . What do you got to say , man ? Talk to me ! Talk to me , Gary . ( groaning ) I need names . ( spits ) Give me a name ! ( choking ) Talk to me , Gary . ( spits ) GARY : Daniel Armand ! Daniel Armand . Daniel Armand . ( coughing ) Okay . That 's a start . Who else ? That 's it . He was my only contact . ( wheezing ) I never met anyone else in the group . He kept us all separate . I 'm sorry . I 'm just having a hard time believing that 's true . BOLL : His pulse is tachy at 210 . Systolic 's up to 240 . We need to lay off . We 've only got one name . Can 't put him under again . Not for a few hours . We haven 't got a few hours . Don 't worry . He 's my responsibility . GARY : No . No . No , he 's not . He 's ours . ( Gary spitting ) And he 's done for the day . ( Velcro releases ) ( panting ) Okay . So he 's back . It 's not like we weren 't expecting this . No . Relax . He won 't get anywhere near Isabelle . We 'll find him , and we 'll deal with it . ( tense theme playing ) ( door opens ) You made a mistake . You got the wrong person . I have to go . I don 't think I do . Those things you told me , those things you said I 'm going to do . That 's not me . Uh , I have a choice . And I don 't know who you are , and I don 't know how you think you know so much about me , but you 're wrong . Isabelle . I understand why you 're having trouble adjusting . Growing up is hard ... but don 't be angry at the messenger . It 's not my plan . I 'm just here to help facilitate . To help you reach your full potential . Think of me as a favorite uncle . No . No , I don 't have any uncles . I don 't have any uncles , and I won 't be a part of any plan . That 's fair enough . You can always opt out . You can even try saving your mother if you like . How ? ( quiet , dramatic theme playing ) What is that ? Open it . There aren 't a lot of things that 'll hurt you , Isabelle . But that right there ... that 'll do the job . If you can 't accept the fact that your life is vastly more important than your mother 's , just give yourself that shot . You 'll be dead in minutes . And Lily ? Who knows ? Maybe she 'll wake up and be a young woman again . Will it really save her ? I don 't know . It 's a gamble . But if you can 't live with who you are ... then don 't . ( quiet , dramatic theme playing ) Ah ! Sorry about that . ( paper rustles ) Ah ! Good . I knew it . ( blows ) I knew I had a clean cup somewhere . Now ... where are the filters ? It 's okay . I don 't need coffee . I swear I just saw them . Do you mind if I- - I just use paper towels ? Kevin , if I do this- - If you do it ? You 're already doing it . You 're here , right ? If I monitor you throughout this experiment , I need you to know one thing . If it gets to a point where your life is in danger , I am cutting this off . I will not stand by and watch you die . Well , I would hope not . Because I 'm too valuable . ( chuckles ) I think- - I think this is gonna be fun . I haven 't really ... worked with anyone for quite some time . I 'm looking forward to it . Me too . So ... Wanna draw some blood ? ( slow , dramatic theme playing ) Nina . We were just downstairs . The guard on duty said Wood signed Gary out . Gary was transferred to an NSA-run facility . But he 's a 4400 . He 's our jurisdiction . And someone at the Pentagon signed an order overriding us . Apparently , they feel we lack experience in a high-pressure interrogation . And who do you think put that little bug in their ear ? I don 't know if it was Ryland or not , but we had our shot at Navarro . Now , tomorrow is October 19th . We are a day away from an announced terrorist attack . The NSA thinks they can get him to talk . So where are they taking him ? They didn 't share that information . This is so wrong . This is the only place in the country that 's at least somewhat equipped to handle 4400s . Do you think that I didn 't tell him that ? They weren 't interested . ( knock at door ) Isabelle . Hi . May I come in ? Are you going somewhere ? I saw Dad putting luggage into his car . Oh , we 're just gonna try another clinic ... but we will be away for a while . Do you want me to come with you ? No . No , it 's all right , thank you . Now , if there 's anything that you need , you ... talk to Shawn . He 's- - He 'll be looking out for you . Okay ? And , uh ... I wanna give you this . It 's my wedding band . I inherited it from my grandmother . Her name was Lily too . You used to love to play with it when you were a little baby . I remember . I used to like to bite on it . And my finger too . Heh . You can wear it if you want . I ... always knew that I would give it to you one day . It doesn 't fit me anymore , and ... I 'd hate to lose it . I 'll keep it safe for you . I know you will . ( slow , dramatic theme playing ) I 'm sorry I have to leave so soon . I- - I wish we had more time together . Well , when do you think you 'll be back ? It 's hard to say . Goodbye , Isabelle . ( sighs ) Mm . Bye . ( thunder rumbling ) Thank you very much . I 'll take her from here . Thank you . Okay . You told her we were going over to the hospital ? How did it go over ? Oh , fine . I had it easy . I g- - I got to lie . You 're the one who has to tell her the truth . ( sobs ) ( helicopter whirring ) ( radio chatter ) ( screeching tires ) ( crash ) ( grunting ) ( Gary coughs ) GARY : What 's going on ? ( panting ) What 's happening ? We 'll get him . Funny , that 's the exact same thing Navarro said about you . So far he 's wrong . He never should 've been moved in the first place . There was no reason ! There was every reason . You 're too soft , Tom . I don 't know what 's happened to you . No , I had him , Dennis ! You lost him . Sunset 's in four hours . At this point , we can 't even say with 100 % certainty that it 's gonna rise again in the morning . And the one guy who can tell us is gone . That 's a defeatist attitude . We 'll get him . Yeah , I know . You keep saying that . ( tense theme playing ) Hey , Shawn . You got something for me ? Where 's Daniel ? Busy . He sent me . No , no , no . That 's not how we work . Today it is . You can trust me . You- - You saved my life . I owe you . Come on . Let 's get this over with . I feel a little naked standing out here . ( thunder rumbling ) Thanks . Listen ... if there 's ever anything you need- - ( gasps , grunting ) You sold us ... out . MAN : Get in there , get in there . ( police radio chatter ) You okay ? SHAWN : Yeah , I 'm fine . I don 't guess we 'll be seeing her in court anytime soon . No , you did the right thing by calling us , Shawn . Seriously . You 're a hero . ( ominous orchestral theme playing ) NINA : One minute to go . Just tell me one thing . Are we as prepared as we can be ? The entire country 's on level-red terror alert . All commercial air traffic has been suspended for the day . The National Guard has been deployed to likely targets . ( scoffs ) " Likely targets . " Kind of a broad term . I wish T.J. could 've narrowed that down for us . Well , me too . But we have to keep her sedated to inhibit her ability . I mean , she 's already turned this place into a war zone once . So now we wait . Anyone else feel like they 're staring at a doomsday clock ? ( electronic beep ) Well , that 's it . October 19th . Looks like the world 's still here . For the moment , anyway . ( chattering ) DIANA : Oh , my God ! ( murmuring ) What ? What happened ? It 's the Nova Group . REPORTER : Certainly " miracle " is an imprecise term , but I 'm not sure how else to describe it . To repeat : I 'm broadcasting live from the Nubian Desert , north of Khartoum , where overnight a thousand-acre patch of barren sand has somehow been transformed into fertile wheat fields . Scientists are at a loss to explain the conversion , but tests confirm that the wheat is real and edible . There hasn 't been food growing in that part of the world since before the birth of Christ . They make us all terrified ... and then rather than attacking us , they give us a gift . Our station has just received a statement from the radical 4400 organization known as the Nova Group , claiming responsibility for this morning 's transformation . ( altered voice ) : You are witnesses to the beginning of a new era . What happens next is up to you . The 4400 can be mankind 's greatest ally or its most dangerous adversary . Don 't kid yourself . It 's an attack . An act of aggression , anyway . They just showed everyone that they can change the world , and there 's not a damn thing we can do about it . ( woman talking indistinctly ) ( news voices mingling ) ( slow , dramatic theme playing ) ( phone ringing ) Hello ? I 'm very disappointed in you , Shawn . Daniel . I realize you 're still a young man . But I 'm afraid I can 't forgive you . ( Thirteen Senses " Into The Fire " playing ) WOMAN ( on TV ) : Keith , I 'm broadcasting live from the Nubian Desert ... ¶ Come on Come on ¶ ¶ Put your hands Into the fire ¶ ( baby cries ) It 's okay , Kyle .

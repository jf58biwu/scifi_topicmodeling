 - [ Man # 1 ] Lie to me . - [ Man # 2 ] What ? - I want you to lie to me . - You want me to lie to you , Mr. Phillips ? I need you to lie to me so that I can get a baseline reading . It 's just something I can compare your truthful statements to . Okay . Three plus four equals eight . [ Chuckles ] That 's not a lie ; that 's an untruth . - Tell me a lie . - [ Scoffs ] I don 't ... - lie . - Everybody has lies , Mr.Jordan. - Just tell me one of yours . - You have lies ? Sure . I didn 't misdirect that shipment , Mr. Phillips . We 're not even talkin about that yet . Just give me a lie . Okay . I love my job . Yeah . Me too . [ Engine Starts ] - Good job , Doug . - Poor bastard . The guy transposes a couple of numbers on a shipping form . Now he 's goin ' to jail . Look , the guy misdirected nuclear fuel to an I.R.S. office in suburban Ohio ... - and then , oh , yeah , he covered it up . - Fair enough . [ Man On Radio ] Talk to people who remember things that have never been . Why do people call me and swear there are millions of people missing ... that they remember things that have never been ? - What is " The 2 40 ' " ? - " " What is " The 2 40 " ' ? Who listens to this paranoid crap ? Paranoid crazy people ? [ Man On Radio ] Let 's get to the bottom of this 2 40 business . [ Sports Announcer ] Moves Kimball into scoring - And the Boston Yankees still trailing 7-1 . There 's 1 50 bucks . - And the Yankee hurler is into his windup . - [ Horns Honking ] - Fastball , swung on and missed . - Ain 't gonna get any redder than that . Thanks , Jess . [ Girl Yelling ] - Lewis . ! - I have shoe . - Hey , kiddo . - Give it back , Lewis ! - Hi , Dad . - Hi . - I 'm warning you . Give it back . Lewis . ! - No . - Lewis has her shoe . - Yeah . Noticed that . - And I have a conference call . - I 'll feed the kids . Just not peanut butter again-And Abbie has homework and Lewis needs a bath . Dinner , not peanut butter , homework , bath . The kids are gonna work you about that day at the beach you promised . I mentioned it . You promised . Whatever . The heat 's on , so I covered for you . I told them that you 're very busy and I will try to marry better next time . Please go take your conference call . [ Abbie ] Lewis , you animal , give me my shoe . - [ Doug ] Kentucky . - [ Abbie ] Louisville . - [ Lewis ] I 'm hungry . - [ Doug ] Where 's the mac and cheese ? - We ate it . - Alaska . Juneau . - Michigan . - Lansing . - North Carolina . - Charlotte . Nope . It 's Raleigh . - What about the hot dogs ? - We ate them . Mom said no peanut butter . - [ Phone Ringing ] - Look , it 's that or something undesirable . - How undesirable ? - [ Ringing Continues ] - Yeah . Doug Phillips . - [ Man ] Please hold for ... - Undersecretary of Energy Pierce . - [ Woman ] Agent Phillips ? - Yes , ma 'am . - We have an incident and [ Line Cuts Off ] - [ Conversation On Phone , Indistinct ] - Hello ? - [ Wife ] Doug ? I 'm on a conference call . I 'm hungry ! - Oh . - [ Line Beeps ] - [ Doorbell Rings ] Hmm ? - Flynn . - Long time . Real long time - Like six years . - You get a call ? - Sort of . - What 's goin ' on ? - I need you for a field mission . Field mission ? I 'm U.S. Marines , retired . - [ Lewis ] I 'm hungry . - [ Abbie ] Lewis . ! - My kids . - You 're a family man now . That 's cool . [ Abbie ] I 'm warning you . Give it back . But there 's been an incident , Dad , and the Department needs you . The Department ? - You work for the Department of Energy too ? - In a way . I 'm on loan to them for a special project . Doug , what is going on ? Is that Flynn ? Hey . Sheila . Sorry , but I just need to ... borrow Doug for a little while . - You work for the D.O.E. in a way . - I need to be on this call . Doug , we 're both under orders . - Is it a nuke spill ? - No such luck . Listen , Doug , you are the only one that can help me on this . [ Sighs ] Go.Just go . And nice seeing you , Flynn . Yes . Yes , I 'm here . Uh - Uh , uh - Wait . Let me get a pencil . - [ Engine Starts ] - [ Tires Skidding ] Doug , this is Dr. Toni Newman . She knows we served in the Marines together . - She 's read your file . - How you doin ' ? Okay . Where are we going ? I 'm gonna change your life , Doug . Yeah ? How you gonna do that ? - I 'm gonna invite you to the big show . - Gee , Flynn . Thanks a lot . Here . See if that fits . - You 're kidding , right ? - Sorry . It 's a matter of clearance . All right , not for nothin ' , but I 'm cleared all the way to the top . Agent Phillips ... you have no idea where the top even is . This would be a good time for you guys to tell me what 's goin ' on . - Search and rescue . - Great . Where ? It 's not where , Doug - It 's when . Okay , Doug . It 's a real cozy place you guys got here . Tragically , Toni has no sense of humor . That is patently untrue . Special project . That 's hot fusion . - You cracked hot fusion ? - And would that amaze you ? Unlimited power ? No more fossil fuels , no more pollution ? Yeah , that would amaze me - And you 're 40 years ahead of schedule . - [ Computer Voice ] Access Printed . - [ Beeping ] - [ Flynn ] Doug , meet Dr. Hector Belsky . - These are from you-know-where . - We 're in prelaunch . - We 've got 1 4 hours . No we don 't . The storm 's picked up speed . You have to be in and out in under three . - You have to jump now . Are these chicken or cheese ? - Chicken . - What storm ? - [ Clattering ] - Should I know what 's going on ? - I don 't eat chicken anymore . - Since when ? - Since I saw that documentary on television . - It 's Hurtgen Forest . - Yes , the battle for Hurtgen Forest . Do you know it as well as Flynn says you do ? - Answer truthfully please . - I remember those papers you used to write on it ... - back in officers ' training . - You brought me here to write history papers ? The battle - How well do you know it ? Hurtgen Forest , the Belgian-German border . Fought from September ' 44 to February ' 45 . The Germans were dug in . The mud and snow made the Allied advance ... of the 1 6th , 1 8th and 26th Divisions nearly impossible . In fact , the battle was so intense , Allied commanders ... called in air strikes on their own position . Well , you guys know who won the war don 't ya ? I don 't wanna ruin it for you . He knows this . He can guide us . - [ Electronic Voice ] Lower Level . - Perhaps . And I will try one of these . - [ Chattering ] - [ Computers Beeping ] What storm ? - Do you love your country ? - I love it , but I 'm not in love with it . I was just putting in some toast . It started out as hot fusion . Eight months ago , we ignited the hot fusion accelerator . It worked-with one anomaly : It unleashed a time storm . If you 're going to laugh , do it now . - Shall I laugh ? - I did . The storm was unexpected . It 's a tear in time . You see ? When we turn the engine on , when the storm erupted ... it took us four hours to lock down one end . In those four hours , there were changes in the world above - Changes in history . We labeled those 2 40 minutes , " " The 2 40 . " Clever , isn 't it ? Down here at the core , we were protected . We are the only ones who remember how the world used to be before the 2 40 . The rings in the tunnel before you form a lightning rod of sorts ... to draw the storm in ... when we need to . [ Clears Throat ] Great . Okay . You 've got a time tunnel . - Good for you . - You 're having a hard time with this , yes ? Well , don 't be ashamed . It 's because it won 't fit into your brain . Because , well , to be plain , it 's bigger than your brain . Well , most things are . You say you locked down one end of this time storm . Where 's the other end ? It 's out of control . Whipping around in the past . You see , when it changes events back there , it ripples forward ... and changes things in the present . These ripples show what the time storm is doing in the past . - In World War II . - Yes . If the ripples move ... an unseemly amount , we send a team back to attempt damage control . Is that an unseemly amount ? Unfortunately , yes . This is the worst we 've seen yet . Think of us as FEMA , Agent Phillips . We don 't send a team in for a rain shower , we send a team in for a hurricane . Here 's what we know : The time storm picked up ... a single human being in 1 546 ... and set that person down on the Belgian-German border in 1 944 . Our mission is tojump in , find that visitor ... clean up his or her mess and then jump back before the window closes . You know that battle better than anyone . - Jump back in time ? - Yeah . To 1 944 . [ Scoffs ] A visitor from 1 546 . [ Scoffing ] You know , can 't we just jump back in time 45 minutes instead ? I was making peanut butter sandwiches for my kids ... and I would really like to finish . We can 't send you back to finish those sandwiches . We can only send you to where the time storm is right now - and right now is at the battle of the Hurtgen Forest . Hurtgen Forest . You mean , I go in there ... and I come out in 1 944 . [ Sighs ] These geniuses busted the world , Doug . Now they 're workin on setting it straight . I don 't know if they can do it . I do know that it 's gonna bust more and more unless we do our job . Now , you wanna go back and work that lie detector for the rest of your life ... or do you wanna take this trip and save the world ? [ Phone Ringing ] - Hello . - [ Doug ] Hey , babe . Hey ! Where are you ? - On the job . - Where else ? - What time you 'll be home ? - I 'm not sure . It might be , uh , late . - Are the kids in bed ? - Finally . Lewis put sand in the VCR . Honey , it pains me to say , your son is a technophobe . - Who can blame him ? - [ Knocking ] Honey , I gotta go . They need me . - Can you give the kids a kiss for me ? - Sure . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I , uh - You know how much I love you , right ? Yeah . I love you too . [ Line Clicks Off ] [ Knocking ] Doug , this is Wix , our medic . - How you doin ' ? - How you doin ' ? Wix is also not bad hand-to-hand . I like to think of him as a bodyguard . Excuse me . Tilt your head back , please . - [ Clears Throat , Coughs ] - There we go . Relay chip . Sends back all your vital signs to mission control . Also gives ' em a live feed of what you hear and what you see . It 's two-way , so you can hear them , and it 's language-enabled . Mm-hmm . You , too , can speak German in one simple injection . [ Man On P.A. , Indistinct ] Toni Newman you know . This is J.D. - Hey . - Flynn . Right . Listen , Doug , when we jump back , we do our job , nothing else . First commandment : We don 't take anything or do anything for personal reasons . If you do , it 's considered treason . One misstep back there ... and our present changes forever . Got that ? See ? Okay . Let 's go for a walk . Man-to-man , you know there 's somethin ' a little different ... - about you , soldier . - Don 't ask , don 't tell . [ Flynn ] Now , I hope y 'all peed , ' cause we 're not stoppin ' every ten minutes . Mr. Salazar , take us to launch mode . Any go no-go 's ? - We are go for medical . - We are go for psychological . - We are go for control . - We are go for strategic . - We are go for operations . - We are go for tactical . We are go for comm-link . [ Man ] Time storm approaching . [ Beeping ] - Vital stats spiking . - Power grid at 97 % . Losing visual contact . Just keep walking ! I will not puke . I will not puke . I will not puke . [ Man ] Acquiring target . Sympathy at 42 % . Sympathy at 79 % . - Just keep walking ! - Timeline target . - Ten seconds , nine - - We are at maximum power . Seven , six , five ... four , three , two ... one . Target acquired . - [ Screams ] - [ Rumbling ] [ Chatter ] The team is away . [ Grunts ] - Don 't touch the bullets . - Thanks for the heads-up on that . That was a little close for comfort . Everybody all right ? [ Vomits ] - Every damn time . - Crap . Flynn , the mission clock is running . - Set for return in two hours and 1 5 minutes . - Okay . This is where the visitor came through . What 's the play , Doug ? You 've taken the tours , right ? - You 've walked these fields . - It 's your battle , Doug . That 's why I picked you . Yeah . It is . [ Airplane Engines Rumbling ] See , that 's the Allied air support ... softening up the German 88th Division for their push over the hill . Now , if we wanna find somebody , we 'd better do it before that attack ... - because this whole place turns into hell . - Tick , tick , tick . In my job , I ask a lot of people a lot of questions ... and I 'll tell ya one thing , people return to the familiar . But the bogie 's never been here before , Dougie . Nothing is familiar . J.D. , I am gonna make you like me . About a mile and a half that way , across the Allied line in no-man 's-land ... there 's a church . It 's the Chapel of St. Florent . You could see it , if it were daylight . - Which is when our visitor landed . - Right . Now I 'm from 1 546 , I get put down here in the middle of all this ... in this hell , I see a church , I 'm goin ' for it . Return to the familiar . Okay . We go for the church . Don 't worry , J.D. He 'll never make you like him . You don 't like anybody . - I like you . - Everybody likes me . - I 'm likable . - Phillips 's P.O.V. Take me closer . That watch is appropriate to period , but was not issued by us . All right . Look sharp , people . - [ Dialing ] - [ Line Rings ] Hey , you 've reached Doug 's cell . Leave a message here or try me at the office . Thanks . [ Airplane Engines Rumbling ] - [ Explosions ] - [ Yells ] [ Speaking German ] [ Speaking German ] - When did you say this place turns to hell ? - In about an hour . [ Speaking German ] Let 's go ! [ Man ] Incoming . ! Take it easy . You 're gonna be all right . [ Men Yelling , Indistinct ] We have taken the trench . We have taken the trench . [ Flynn ] We 're in the trench , headed for the church . Hey . Stay sharp , huh ? Bio . Status on Phillips . Heart rate and respiration well above projected norms . - Must be first-time jitters . - Show me Phillips ' P.O.V. [ Explosion ] Phillips , is there a problem ? Doug , you need a hand with that or what ? - We 're looking at Pfc Douglas Phillips . - His grandfather . Sir , our records show the Pfc Phillips died in the battle of Hurtgen Forest . We had only two hours to research the entire mission , sir . Get up . Get your second in that chair . Agent Phillips , so this is why you know our battle so well . You must not interact with him . Listen to my voice . - Sir . - Stay with this mission . Agent Phillips , you have no idea what you are dealing with . Turn and walk away . - You a little scared ? - A little bit . [ Explosion ] - [ Belsky ] Do you hear me ? - Why isn 't he responding ? - He doesn 't want to . - I 'll bet your home life ... must seem pretty far away right now . - You 'd win that bet , sir . - You have somebody at home , Private ? She 's pretty . Boy , I keep thinkin ' about all the times we were together . When I wasn 't really there . Thinkin ' about all the wasted time . Hey , look at that ! Kind of like mine . But you 've got the wrong time . This watch was my grandfather 's . He fought in the last war . - J.D. , we may have a breach . - I 'm on it . That 's my wife , Pfc Phillips . My kids . They 're worth everything I have to give . Tell me , Private , what is your family worth ? Everything . What you are gonna do today , you 're doing for them . And you do it for them . Yes , sir ! Carry on , Private . Sir ! Your grandfather ... did he make it back , sir ? Come on , kid . We 're movin ' out . - Let 's go ! - You know ... let 's forget I asked that . Thank you , sir . I really wish you hadn 't done that . This mean you don 't like me yet ? - Put the gun up , J.D. ! - I can 't do that . - Put it up . - I can 't do it . That was his grandfather . Tell me you didn 't talk to him . He dies today . He doesn 't make it . I 've got this , J.D. We got a job to do here . We brought him here to find someone . You get him squared away . Let me guess . She wasn 't always with the Department of Energy . No , she 's C.I.A. Her orders are to take care of any member of the team ... that screws with time for personal reasons . I 'm a major . You tell me why I can 't reassign him right now . Take him out of this hell . Because it 's happened already . - You can 't change it . - No . - He 's dead . - He 's not dead . There 's still time . If you screw with the past , you risk everything in the present . Once we 're back here , nothing in our time is for certain . - Everything could change . - Yeah . Well , at least he lives . Are you willing to risk your family for that ? What do you mean my family ? What are we talking about ? Procedure . Procedure . I don 't believe you . He 's just a scared kid . What difference could it possibly make if he lives ? I was an engineer working under Belsky on the hot fusion project . Working close to the core , I was protected . I remember the world before the time storm changed everything . Before those four hours , before the 2 40 ... I 'd come from a big family - three brothers , two sisters . After the 2 40 , when I came back to the surface , that had all changed . My parents were exactly the same ... but , suddenly , I had no brothers or sisters . They were gone . They weren 't dead . They just never were . They were part of a life that suddenly had never happened . I 'm an only child . I can 't even grieve with my parents ... because all they 've ever known is that I 'm an only child . I wish I were like you . I wish I didn 't remember . Just do your job . - Toni . - Don 't ask that . You don 't know what I was gonna ask . You wanna know who you were before the 2 40 . Don 't ask that . You are who you are . [ Beeping Rapidly ] [ Belsky ] The storm 's accelerating again . You have less than 30 minutes to find the visitor . [ Door Closes ] Toni , you took a hit in your pack . Check the return ticket . - The bullet just nicked the case . - Copy that . We 've got company ! - No ! - No . It 's okay . - No . ! - No , no . It 's okay . It 's okay . - American ? - Yeah . - [ Sobs ] You are American ? - Yeah . - If she can spot a G.I. , she 's here and now . - Are you alone ? - Yes . - You 've seen no one ? No one . I 'm alone here . [ Woman ] No ! He was sent to me . God sent him to me to keep safe . - Please ! - [ Indistinct ] Please . He knew me for what I have longed [ Woman Sobs ] - P.O. V. Isolate and analyze . - Hand-spun . Coarse weave . Mid-1 500 's . - Got him . Can you tell me your name ? Hmm ? Your name ? It 's okay . I used to have a brother just about your age . His name was Joseph , but I called him " " Beans . " Now if you don 't tell me your name , I 'm gonna have to call you " Beans . ' " Please . Please , let her go . There was a field of dead soldiers . I was looking for my husband . The boy appeared to me there . God sent him to me . Please . Can you tell us your name ? Jacques , milady . I am just a monk . BrotherJacques Mitton . How the hell does a teenaged monk change the future of the planet ? [ Doug ] Tell us about your home . I was at vespers ... and there was a horrible sound ... and then I was here . The sky was falling . The ground was exploding . Am I being punished , master ? Am I in Hell ? No . You are not in hell . Can you tell us about your family ? They are dead . They are all dead . My village is dying . Dying from the " " Death . " Wanna check on that last translation ? - [ Man ] Checking translation . - We got Krauts on our six . - Let 's go . - Come on . The ticket . - [ Flynn ] How we doin 'on that translation ? - [ Woman ] Reading back now . [ Woman ] " The others were dying , dying from the Death . ' " The Death . He 's carrying the plague . The church is about to get overrun . The disease will spread to the Allied troops . Flynn , I think we found your hurricane . And that 's how a teenaged monk changes the future of the planet . Aw , come on . F.Y.I. , every time you sneak a look at my ass ... 1 00 people back at mission control get a good look too . [ Doug ] Got it . [ Screams ] - What is happening here ? - I was praying and he came in . Get out of here . Now ! - Where 's your regiment ? - I was on patrol for the Third Division . Our half-track hit a mine . I was sent ahead to assess the situation . And how was the assessing ? Lucky you 're not wounded . Hmm . Know what I think ? Do you ? I think you 're a deserter . I have no report of a half-track hitting a mine . - Who is your colonel ? - At ease , Sergeant ! I see you have found my man . Yes , with one of the village girls . This is how you investigate the premises ? - Ampicillin-Antibiotic in my pack . - I 'm on it . Prepping for inoculation . I am Colonel Klink . Our half-track hit a mine three kilometers up the road ... we sent Schmidt to investigate . - I 'm sorry , Colonel , but I must insist on seeing your papers . - Schultz . We will rest here and then set off on foot at dusk . Let 's go . - Did you have to slap me ? - Have to ? No . - You have issues . - You think ? - How 's Schultz ? - [ Imitating German Accent ] I know nothing . - [ Flynn ] We 're clear . - Let 's move . Come on . Up . Come on . This is a potion . It will save you from the Death . Good . Our work here is done . Let 's go home . - Wait . What about him ? - [ Flynn ] Bring him with us . - He doesn 't belong with us . - He doesn 't belong here either . - That 's the way it 's gonna be . You know that . - Negative . Negative for return . The ripples are still coming . The plague must still be spreading . - Who did we miss ? - We have 1 7 minutes . You do what you can in that time ; then you come home . Did you touch the water in the font ? Of course . This is a house of God . He contaminated the water . The Germans . They 're infected . This is the center of the break-out . Hundreds of thousands of troops will be moving through here . There Germans will spread the plague to both sides . Hey . [ Grunts ] - We have to inoculate Nazis ? - Technically , not inoculate . Inject with an antibiotic . - I got one and two . - I got three ! - I got four . - I got this last one . He 's gotta get his intel back . He 'll head north . Did your brother Beans die from the Death ? No . It was something else . There was no potion for him ? No . [ Yelling ] Toni , get ready to get us home ! Return ticket activated . Sorry , folks . - It 's time for you to go . - No . Please . Please , he needs me . Go . Now . Don 't you want to know why - why God would send so gentle an angel ... into a world so full of pain ? - [ Gunshot ] - [ Screams ] - No . [ Beeping ] [ Grunting ] I 'm not gonna kill ya . I wanna kill ya , but I can 't ... because it 's a rule - a really stupid rule . [ Belsky ] The ripples have stopped . Your mission is completed . - [ Flesh Tearing ] - [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] Flynn . ! No , stop . ! Doug . [ Grunting ] I know you wanna kill , but you can 't . Everything could change . Doug , you can 't . [ Groaning Loudly ] [ Toni ] Doug , Flynn , where are you ? Three minutes and counting until they lose the storm , sir . [ Doug ] Wix ! Wix ! - Wix , I need your help ! Come on . - [ Grunting ] - Set for return in two minutes . Medical team is standing by . - Right here . Right here . [ Wix ] Lift up his legs . Make room for his head . - Here you go , buddy . - Oh , my God . Hang in there , buddy . Hang in there . Okay . How close are we , Toni ? - Almost there . - Okay . - Doug . - Shh . Toni wasn 't the only one who was in the core when it happened . When the time storm ripped open , I was at the core too . I was down there , protected . [ Groans ] I remember before ... before the storm changed everything . I knew you before the 2 40 . I did . I knew you . - He doesn 't need to know this . - [ Breathing Heavily ] Listen to me . You don 't remember . Everything was the same for you - everything except - God , you were a lonely son of a bitch . [ Laughs ] No wife , Doug . No kids . Eight months ago , you were a goddamn loner . You understand me ? - Yeah . - No , no . No , no , no . The 2 40 gave you a family . Do you understand me ? Huh ? Yeah . I understand you . Good . More morphine . - [ Breathing Heavily ] - Shh . You were always so sad . - I like you better this way . - Return pulse in three , two ... - one . - It 's okay . It 's okay . - [ Beeping ] - Uplink locked . We are bringing you home in 60 seconds . 50 seconds . You are committed for return . Go . Go to her now . Go . - Kid ! - Hold your ground . He 's been injected . 40 seconds . I told you I 'd change your life . 30 seconds . - 20 , 1 9 ... - Take him back . - 1 8 , 1 7 , 1 6 ... - Take him back before he was stabbed . - You hear me ? - 1 5 , 1 4 ... - 1 3 , 1 2 , 1 1 ... - Take him back . - 1 0 - - We can only go where the storm takes us . Eight , seven , six ... five , four - Three , two , one . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? - [ Door Opens ] - I have a spoon . [ Sighs ] Hi , Daddy . Hi . - [ Laughs ] - Lewis has a spoon . Yeah . I noticed that . I hate sleeping without you . I hope it was for a good cause . Yeah . It was . You 're squishing me ! Come on . Let 's go wash your hands . - [ Phone Line Ringing ] - [ Sighs ] - [ Woman , Indistinct ] - Hey , it 's Doug . I just had to talk to someone . - [ Toni ] Are you okay ? - Yeah , I just , um - - Why did Flynn tell me ? - You know why . To give me something to protect . - Did it work ? - Yeah . [ Doug ] Why are you on the team ? [ Toni ] What I lost , I lost . The only thing I can do is make sure it doesn 't happen to anyone else . - You gonna be okay ? - [ Doug ] Yeah . - [ Doug ] You ? - I always am .

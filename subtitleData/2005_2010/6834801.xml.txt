 GSW left upper quadrant . Possible hemothorax . BP is dropping . Eighty over 50 . Pulse , 120 . - Breath sounds ? - Decreased . Labored , but stable . - Get me a chest scan . - Doctor . There 's something else . I heard about Nina Sharp . Do we know who shot her ? The security guard and doorman are dead . No ID on the gunmen . - She gonna be ... ? - Too early to say . Sir , no official statement from Massive Dynamic or William Bell . Thanks . That 's no surprise . They say their COO was shot , their stock will take a hit . Hey , Liv . Security footage just came in . We had Video Tech assemble the three video cameras . They shoot the night guy , they replace him then this guy comes in and they all head upstairs . - Evening . - Nina Sharp comes in six minutes later . ( SILENCED GUNSHOT ) MAN : Take out the camera . You can do it here . CHARLIE : Then it goes black for four minutes . OLIVIA : What did he do to her ? Whatever it was , it only took him four minutes . Who is he ? - Can we enhance what he said ? TECH : Sure . MAN : Take out the camera . We can do it here . Take out the camera . We can do it here . Take out the camera . We can do it here . Take out the camera . We can do it here . Take out the camera . We can do it here . Run it through voice recognition . Take out the camera . We can do it here . Take out the camera . We can do it here . Take out the camera . We can do it here . Take out the camera . We can do it here . OLIVIA : David Robert Jones . Why is he wearing bandages and the others are wearing masks ? Not easy when you 're on half the world 's watch list . Maybe he tried to change his appearance . OLIVIA : Our information suggests Jones is working for Bell . So why shoot his number two ? It doesn 't make sense . Maybe our information is wrong . Why don 't we go straight to the source and bring William Bell in for questioning ? - I don 't think ... - We have intelligence that Bell is funding these horrific events . Most of which have been carried out by Jones . At this point I don 't care how powerful William Bell is or how deep his political connections go . He is not above the law . - Dunham ... - Sir , with all due respect I have too much in this professionally and personally , that if you stand in the way now ... Dunham . I came in here to begin making the calls I need to make to get the interview that we both agree is necessary . I would also request that you stop cutting me off every time I 'm about to tell you you 've struck oil as I was going to do when we first came through that door . ( PHONE RINGS ) This is Broyles . Nina Sharp is out of surgery . ASTRID : Hey . - Hey . - Where 's Walter ? - With you ? Mm-mm . I went to check . His bed wasn 't slept in . - I thought he worked here all night . - I thought he went home with you . Hey . I need to talk to Walter . Is he here ? - Yeah , take a number . - I 'm gonna check the cafeteria . - See if he slept there again . PETER : Okay . - You don 't look so good . - David Robert Jones shot Nina Sharp . - I wanted to see if ... - Hi , hi . It 's Peter Bishop calling . I was wondering if you maybe have an eye on my father ? He wandered off again . Yeah . Look , could you go check down in the marine biology lab ? He sometimes spends the night cleaning out the tanks with Mrs. Ericson . No , I 'll wait , I 'll wait . Thank you . Do you think he left because of what I said ? What he 's referring to as " the assault in the pastry shop " ? - I don 't know . It 's hard to say . - It was about Cortexiphan . Bell 's trials . I wanted to see if Walter knew what Bell did to me . I know . He told me . You caught him off guard . I understand you had your reasons for saying what it is that you had to say . And I know he understands that too . He 's not there . No one 's seen him . Hello . No luck , huh ? Okay , well , thanks for your help . Peter . I 'm sorry that I was so hard on him . He 's probably at the hotel working his way to the bottom of a pint of rocky road . I think to repair that , one requires a special skill set . ( SIGHS ) Phillip . You 've been shot . We discovered it was Jones . You 're lucky . Not too many gunshot victims ... You 'll be up and about in no time . What did he want , Nina ? What did he do to your arm ? Get me Agent Dunham . I need to speak with her right away . Agent Dunham . ( TOOLS WHIRRING ) BROYLES : Specialists from Massive Dynamic . SPECIALIST : I 'm done . Seal the wound . NINA : I 'll be right with you , Agent Dunham . Let 's just say this treatment doesn 't fall under any HMO . No . NINA : William Bell is not the problem . He 's certainly not the head of any terrorist organization . OLIVIA : Well , I 'll make that judgment , thank you . Well , it 's true Jones used to work for William Bell 15 years ago . In fact , he was one of our first employees at Massive Dynamic . But he was let go . - Why ? - Details aren 't important . Suffice to say that Jones felt spurned by the rejection . William was a father figure to him . A respected mentor . I would go as far as to say that all the death and destruction that Jones has caused up until this point has been a way of proving something to William . To prove what ? NINA : Jones always felt that he was special . And that no one recognized that . Certainly not William . Before the shooting , when was the last time you saw David Jones ? Oh , I haven 't seen him for years . But after he broke out of prison he was contacting our offices requesting meetings with Dr. Bell . Over the past few weeks , his calls have become rather extreme . You 've been in contact with a known felon ? It was an internal matter . Clearly , we thought we could manage this better than we did . BROYLES : Apparently , Jones is ill . Dying from the teleportation from his prison break . Nina believes Jones ' agenda is to kill William Bell when he finds him . Then we need to put him in protective custody . NINA : Not possible . - Why not ? Where is he ? - I can 't say . - This is ridiculous . Listen to me , Agent Dunham . I can 't say because I don 't know . I haven 't seen William Bell for months . He 's been communicating with me strictly electronically . But what I do know though , is speaking with William Bell has become more than a professional matter for you . In fact , I 'm counting on that . Stop Jones and I will personally arrange a meeting between you and Bell . But if Jones gets to Bell first I 'm afraid all the answers you 're searching for die with him . What did Jones want from you ? What did he do to you in the elevator ? He stole a very powerful energy cell that Dr. Bell hid within my arm . What can he do with it ? Unfortunately , the question is , what can 't he do ? ( DEVICE POWERS UP ) ( HIGH-PITCHED WHINING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) TECH : Coordinate tracking is complete , sir . You can increase sonic frequency . It 's locked in . Stabilize , damn it . TECH : The coordinates are separating , sir . It 's not working , they 're still separating . We 're losing it . We can 't hold it open . ( CAR HORNS HONKING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) It 's too thick here . These are the wrong coordinates . ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) Try again , please . Do you recognize this ? How did you get that ? OBSERVER : This coin looks similar to the one you 're thinking of . But it is from another place . There is more than one of everything . I have said too much . I 'm not supposed to get involved . I have taken you as far as I can . - Does this house look familiar to you ? WALTER : Yes . Do you remember what you have to find ? You must try to remember . There isn 't much time . ( BELL TOLLING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) BROYLES : Agent Astrid Farnsworth ? I 'd like you to meet Nina Sharp . Hello . Uh , how are you feeling ? The extent of my injuries was greatly exaggerated . We want to ask you a few questions about Dr. Bishop . - Okay . - Has he been acting strange lately ? Walter acting strange ? Um , no stranger than usual . Did he speak to anyone or has anyone contacted him that you 've never heard of ? ASTRID : No . - Should I be concerned ? - Should she be ? - Peter , hello . PETER : Miss Sharp . - What 's going on ? - Agent Dunham told you about ... - ... the attack by David Robert Jones ? - Yeah . Jones is in possession of something your father may know something about . When was the last time you saw Dr. Bishop ? Last night . Why ? You think Jones has something to do with his disappearance ? Dr. Bishop gets lost more often than you would imagine . I 'm sure you 're right . - This is Broyles . - It 's me . I need a Priority One grid search . Target is Walter Bishop . CHARLIE : What happened ? Where 's the other half of the truck ? Suddenly , there was this shimmer , like a curtain almost , or a window . My colleague said you saw a man with a machine . What did it look like ? The man was holding , like , this black square ... - ... like it was scanning something . - Truck came out of nowhere . It just appeared . Like it came through the window . What was on the other side of it was different . It was emitting this sound , like a loud noise . It didn 't look like it was doing anything , but it did . - Do you remember what he looked like ? - He was wearing a mask . Are you sure it was a mask and not bandages ? Yeah , more like bandages . BROYLES : Take a look at this . NINA : This image of your father was taken three hours ago near East Douglas , in Grafton . Massive Dynamic maintains access to all the cameras we manufacture . This security footage was from the local commuter train station . ( PETER SIGHS ) I think I 'm starting to understand a little better . This is near a beach house that we own . Walter used to love it up there because it 's quiet . My father has had a particularly rough couple of days . I 'm not sure everything 's making sense to him right now . We have agents canvassing the area if you give us the address ... Actually , if you don 't mind I 'd rather go up there and bring him back myself . - I think that 's for the best right now . - Of course . PETER : Thanks . AGENT : Agent Francis . Driver died on impact . Blunt-force trauma to the head . That 's what we got so far . - You sure this is right ? - Yeah . OLIVIA : What ? The prints aren 't coming back on the driver . The truck isn 't registered in New York , or anywhere else . The VIN number , the serial part numbers ... - ... they don 't exist . - What does that mean ? This truck was never made . How is that possible ? No , I 'm not gonna say it again , get back . Where the hell did it come from ? Walter ? Walter ? Hello , Peter . Walter , what are you doing here ? You had us worried . I 'm looking for something . I think it might be in this house . And it 's very important . Okay . What are you looking for ? I just can 't recall , son . That 's the thing . OLIVIA : You 're not telling us everything . If Jones is looking for Bell then what does an energy cell and a truck from nowhere ... - ... have to do with it ? - Nothing comes out of nowhere . - Then where does it come from ? NINA : I think you know that . I think you already suspect where Bell is . Are you saying that you know where Bell is ? Stop playing games with me . Tell me where he is or I assure you , I will turn this world over looking for him . Well , that 's just the problem , Agent Dunham . William Bell is not in this world . Look out , look out , look out . ( CHEERING ) CHARLIE : You 're saying that William Bell disappeared into a different universe . Like Dorothy going to Oz ? Well , Walter calls it an alternate reality . - Do you understand ? - Not remotely . You 're saying that William Bell is not on this planet ? No , he is . Just another version of this planet . Have you ever had déjà vu ? Living a moment you already lived before , yes . What does déjà vu have to do with where Bell is ? Déjà vu is like a glimpse into the other side . You feel like you 've been somewhere before , because in another reality you have . BROYLES : But déjà vu is just a window . Some individuals may be able to do more than just see into the other world . They may be able to travel there . The incident on the street . That 's why we can 't ID the truck . It came from the other side . That 's what Jones is using the energy cell for . He 's trying to cross over . To get to Bell . ( PHONE RINGS ) ( CELL PHONES RINGING ) - Broyles . - Dunham . - It 's Francis . - Where ? PETER : Walter , just calm down . Yes , Peter . It 's true . I started something a long time ago . I did , I did , it 's the truth , I did and there 's no getting past that . - Walter . - And I have to finish it . Walter . Walter . I need you to take a breath and calm down . In this damned house . It 's so ... - It 's in my mind . - Walter . I need you to take a deep breath . How do you ... ? I can 't find it and I don 't know where to look . I don 't know where to look . And it 's so important to look . - I don 't know where to look . PETER : Walter . Walter , where are you ... ? Walter ... Where are you going ? Walter , look , it 's getting late , we need to head back . WALTER : No , not yet . You know , I remember when we used to come down here during the summers . Mom and I. You were always still working back in the city . I 'd stand out here on the beach for hours , just looking at the ocean . It used to seem like it went on forever . And on Saturdays , I 'd always wake up just before my alarm . I could smell the pancakes . Which meant that you were here . I 'd creep down the stairs and there you 'd be . Standing over the stove , flipping pancakes . You seemed so big back then . Whales . PETER : I 'd just stand there , watching you . - Then you 'd always flip one of the ... - Whales . I made them in the shape of whales . - They were your favorite . - Yes . Peter , I remember . Thank you . I know why I 'm here . I know where it is . CHARLIE : Okay , so tell me exactly what you saw . TEENAGER : I was standing there , by the field . Lance went back , you know , to get the ball . That 's when I saw it . It was like a see-through wall appeared . It sort of shimmered . Like a heat wave , you know ? Like something was there , but it wasn 't . " It was there and it wasn 't " ? It was like a window . But warped . - Then it shut . - Thank you . - Hey . - Okay . So him and his friend are playing soccer . Kid 's running with the ball . All of a sudden they see a shimmer of light . Kid hits the shimmer and then he just sort of collapses . OLIVIA : And did anyone see Jones ? CHARLIE : No . But there 's a bit more to go . Go ahead . How does something like that happen ? I can 't believe I 'm gonna say this . Let 's assume that Jones was trying to make this doorway into another universe . Why here ? I mean , first New York , now here . What do they have in common ? OLIVIA : Hey , Chad . - Third floor can 't find a connection between the incident in New York and the one on the soccer field . Go through our database . Cross-reference any incidents connected to science , biology or unexplained phenomenon . Have the files sent to my office , please . - Dating back how far ? - All of them . Just put them down there , thank you . You can roll that one into the corner . Sir , we need to call Nina Sharp . I found a connection between what Jones did in New York and that park in Providence . Walter , tell me what you 're looking for . Here , I got it . Aha ! It 's still here . I was beginning to be afraid that ... Here . This is why we 're here . It 's locked . OLIVIA : This is a record of all local incidents related to the Pattern . Some go back more than 20 years . We 've done this ourselves at Massive Dynamic . A dozen top analysts have spent the better part of two years ... There 's seemingly no obvious logic or predictability . It took me a while to see it myself . But these are the spots where Jones used his device . Now look at this . ( KEYBOARD CLACKING ) That can 't be a coincidence . - So , what does it mean ? - I think I may know . PETER : Got it . So , what exactly is that ? When Belly and I were younger men we regularly ingested large quantities of LSD . You don 't say . We became convinced what we saw while on the drug was real . We believed that we were catching glimpses of another reality . Another world . Just like ours , but slightly different . Populated by slightly different versions of ourselves . We all experience it momentarily as déjà vu . And Belly and I could prolong it with hallucinogenics . But the question , of course , was how to get there without LSD . Belly , as you know , theorized that young children had the capacity to see these other worlds naturally . I know . You already told me about that . Bell 's experiments with Cortexiphan . Yes , he theorized that properly nurtured , these abilities could be heightened . Intensified . And that , in time , his subjects may be able to travel from here to there . Over there . You mean , an alternate world ? Around this time , something was lost to me , Peter . Something precious . I became convinced that if only I could cross over myself then I could take from there what I had lost here . You were just gonna open up a hole and walk over to the other side ? No , it 's not that simple . You have to find the right place first . NINA : Finding the right place to cross over is the key . Dr. Bell once posited that our world has soft spots . Places where the fundamental constants of nature the speed of light , gravity , the mass of a proton , for example have begun to decay . As a result , in these particular areas the membrane between the realities is thinner , almost porous . The Bermuda Triangle is one . But there are others . And until recently , these areas were extremely rare . What do you mean , " until recently " ? What happened ? We happened , Agent Dunham . Scientific progress , advancing technologies by meddling with the laws of nature has hastened the decay of these constant fundamentals and increased the number of soft spots . Jones is looking for one of these soft spots ? Yes . In the belief that by releasing the right kind of energy and aiming it exactly at the proper spot he could effectively break through . WALTER : Of course , there 's a problem opening a hole to another reality . In theory , that would also allow things from there to pass over here . Which could be dangerous . - And so I also built a plug . - A plug ? Actually , more a patch . To close the hole should the need should ever arise . This is that patch , Peter . This is what I had to find . Okay , just so I 'm clear . Somewhere out there , there is a hole to another reality ... - ... and you need to plug it ? - Yes , I 'm afraid so . - Well , do you know where it is ? - Yes . Yes , I do , Peter . Reiden . Reiden Lake . Identify another soft spot . Then we 'll know where he 's going . Expand the search parameters . Did you map beyond the Eastern Seaboard ? - No , they 're not in our database . - I 'll have the files transferred . Which of these events are the oldest ? Do you remember ? I mean , if these events are somehow consequences of soft spots , then ... Well , these are the first recorded incidents . They all go back more than 15 years . Becca 's Meadow . That was the site of the first incident we know about . Wait . All of these incidents point to here . That 's where he 's going . Reiden Lake . JONES : Get all the gear , get set up . Come on , men . We 're going to the other side . It 's just the other side of the lake . The place where I opened the hole . - That 's awfully convenient . - Not convenient at all . That 's why I bought the beach house in the first place . For proximity . Come on , Peter . Can 't you go faster ? We may not have much time . What 's gonna happen if we 're not on time ? I don 't know . But my friend came and he said we must . And he only comes when it 's of dire consequence . - And what friend would that be ? - The bald one . You mean the one that Olivia calls the Observer ? The man who attacked me in the woods ? He must have had a good reason . I 'm sure he didn 't mean you any harm . - What else aren 't you telling me , Walter ? - Lots , I 'm sure . But none of it 's relevant . Goodness , it 's been so long . This all looks the same . Oh . Peter , Peter , Peter . Stop it , stop . PETER : Okay . Now what ? That thing 's not gonna blow up , is it ? I certainly hope not . What ? You may not remember this . When you were a boy , you were very sick . Dying . And sometimes you got scared . And to calm yourself , to forget what you were going through you took to collecting coins . This one ... This was your favorite . You 're right . I don 't remember any of that . I do . Walter ! - It 's okay , it 's okay ! PETER : Take it easy . OLIVIA : They 're with me . It 's okay . CHARLIE : Hey , hey , easy , easy . - Agent Dunham . - How did you know where we were ? What are you doing here ? Trying to plug a hole in the universe . What are you doing here ? - Apparently , the same thing . - But how did you ... ? ( HIGH-PITCHED WHINING ) WALTER : Oh , no . CHARLIE : What is that ? Dr. Bishop , stay down . JONES : Keep going , please . Don 't stop what you 're doing . Hold them off as long as you can . CHARLIE : Olivia , I 'll cover you . Walter . Hey , Walter . Stay here . They need this to close the portal , to prevent him from going over . - Give it to me . I 'll do it . Give it to me ! - Okay . All right . It 's simple , a child could do it . You just twist this . JONES : What 's the status ? TECH : Coordinates are coming into place , sir . ( GUNSHOT ) We 're almost there , sir . Jones . Don 't move . - Manifold is stable . - Don 't move . Stop . Don 't move . Beautiful , isn 't it ? - You understand this reunion is brief ? - If you take one more step , I 'll shoot . JONES : Goodbye , Agent Dunham . - Jones . The teleporter . It may be killing me , but in the meantime it 's made me something rather special . You see , your bullets just go right through me . And soon , Dr. Bell will see just how special I am . ( THUNDER CRASHING ) - Stop ! - Dunham . Hey . Hey . Under normal circumstances , I would ask you when I could expect your report . But in this case , I find myself at a bit of a loss . - How 's Nina ? - She 's doing fine . She wanted me to convey her gratitude . What ? We 've been told to cease and desist our investigation into William Bell . - By whom ? - The kind of people that when they give you an order , you don 't question it . I 'm sorry . Dr. Bishop . Good news . I got you some Berry Boom . Hey . What 's wrong ? " Stepping out for a bit . Don 't worry about me , son . I know where I 'm going . " You want me to call the police ? No . That is the first time he 's ever written a note . I think our little boy is growing up . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - Hello ? NINA : Agent Dunham , it 's Nina Sharp . You held up your end of the bargain , now I 'd like to hold up mine . - Mind coming to Manhattan tomorrow ? - Sure . Do you know the Mutsumi Hotel on Broadway ? - Yes . - Great . Tomorrow it is , then . I hope you understand why I can 't go through channels . And I appreciate it if you didn 't tell anyone about this , either . I don 't mean to sound overly cautious but I think you 'll soon understand why we 'll want to keep this between us . At , say , 1 : 00 ? Come alone . I 'll answer any questions you have . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( CAR HORN HONKS ) No , thank you . Nina Sharp . Olivia Dunham . No , I don 't want to leave a message . She 's expecting my call . What do you mean she 's out of the country ? ( HIGH-PITCHED WHINING ) Agent Dunham , welcome . Right this way . Go right in . MAN : I 've been waiting quite a long time for this . Where am I ? Who are you ? The answer to your first question is very complicated . The answer to your second ... I 'm William Bell .

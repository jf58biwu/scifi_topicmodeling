 Life happens in four dimensions . Subtract time from the equation , and all you have is space . No motion , no change . Take away time , and you change everything we know and believe , everything we understand . Imagine a stopped clock . There would be no rush hour . No more rushing , because you could never be late . No birth , no death , no broken hearts . Summer vacations would never end . You 'd never lose a job . Your wife could never leave you . There 'd be no crime , no war . Nothing new and nothing old . No " will be , " no " want to be , " no " has been . " Just one long uninterrupted " is . " It 's hard to imagine , because all we know , or all we think we know , is that time passes . We are taught it , from the cradle to the grave . That time waits for no man . A hundred years of invention have created an unseen network between us . Streams of electrical energy , radio waves , microwaves , light waves , cell phones , PDAs , TV , wireless networks , remotes , garage door openers , you name it . You 've heard of the World Wide Web ? Well , you 're the fly that just got stuck in it . Time does not exist as we know it . Even the universe is not what it appears to be . It takes the light from those distant stars millions of years to get here . You 're seeing into the past . Gazing out at a galaxy that might not be there anymore . You 're not looking at the night sky . You 're staring into the heart , a time machine . Are you going to keep me in suspense ? Conway , Stuart . Doctorate in Theoretical Physics , Berkeley . Studied under Bernstein , who called him brilliant but irritating . Fell out over the authorship of research papers . Bernstein vanished in 1999 . Some wish Conway would , too . I 'm not going to try to pronounce the title of his thesis , but I 'm sure it 's completely fascinating . He looks like all the other lonely programmers . Recruited by Uncle Sam for military applications of string theory . But came up with nothing in 5 years . He alienated everyone he worked with , so they cut his funding . Are you going to open that ? Let 's see Well ... Looks like your lonely programmer doesn 't exist . What 's this ? " Slipstream . " Why delete all the background intel ? Maybe it 's a homeland security project . You 'd be investigating yourself , and you wouldn 't even know it . It 's a total waste of time . I thought you liked hanging around parking lots with a fashionable guy . I 'm not saying I don 't . Just maybe I shouldn 't . So , where to ? Assuming you got no interest in tailing this guy . - I want to get some more coffee . - You just had 3 cups . I don 't want to lose my edge . Looks like he 's approaching the speed limit . Now , listen to this : 3 bedrooms , a washer-dryer , two-car garage , fenced-in yard . Sounds great . You moving ? Last night you said my apartment was too small for both of us . That was last night . - This is today . - And it 's cold . - I thought men don 't like commitments . - Only when it 's their choice . Bloody Yanks ! Not enough they drive on the wrong side . They 're colorblind , as well . Leave off . I 'll do the driving . Right . He 's just thrown off my schedule . Hold onto your seatbelts , ducks . - That 's your last cup of coffee . - Wankers ! Okay ? Why don 't we just hit the armored truck ? Are you a complete jerk ? So , boys , when do we go for the money ? Boss . - Runson ? - When the money is most available . Genius . And when might that be ? When it 's not in the armored car . They 're hard work . Hope they don 't hurt themselves . Want to tell me what 's going on ? Can we talk about this later ? Not on company time ? Oh I forgot . Your career . One of us should take it seriously . Okay . Let 's drop the whole thing . Look , you can almost see the sweat dripping down his palms . In 2 minutes , the money will be placed behind the counter , but not yet in the safe . The guards will have gone , and we 'll have at most 5 minutes . No gun fire , no problems . Yeah ? Stupids ? Who are you calling stupid ? Stupid . Them , Boss . The next customer , please . Hello , Margaret . Can you believe it ? Another payday The real question is : how are you today ? - Tick , tick , tick . - What 's that ? Biological clock . I thought you wanted to drop the whole thing . My short-term memory hasn 't been the same since college . Do you need a deposit slip for that , sir ? I 'd like to think we 're on a first-name basis by now . Good thing . You need a deposit slip ? It 's Stuart . It 's Stuart . I want to ask you a question . Come here . Ever wish you could do the same thing over and over again ? Like cashing a paycheck , for instance . Just keep cashing it . Wouldn 't that be ... outrageously outrageous ? Sir , there are other people in line . Yeah , I know . I 'm just saying what if ? It 's one of those hypotheticals , you know . Right , yeah . Let me just cash my check and allow me to withdraw 2,000 dollars . It leaves you with 1 dollar 47 . Perfect . Looks quite flavorful . Is that a nonfat - soy foodarama ? - No . Are hundreds okay ? I love hundreds . You know , Maggie ? Can I call you that ? Maggie ? I 've been coming here a couple times a week for several years . I could go to the ATM , sure . But , I 'm old-fashioned . I 'd like a bit of personal service . You know , from a human being . From you , actually . A hundred and eighteen , a hundred and nineteen , one hundred and twenty . Go , go , go ! - Keep the motor running , baby . - " Clockwork Orange . " Get ' em , babe . Forgive me . I really want to get to know you , as a person . I want to have a deep conversation with you . Every time I get the opportunity , I can 't help but fixate on your perfect skin , your cornflower eyes , your scent . It 's like you just stepped out of a bath . I hope you take this as a compliment . You 're just so ripe . Like a ... piece of fruit . I can 't stand it . I just want to eat you . - Is something wrong ? - Can 't you leave me alone ! - 1 dollar 47 . - Wow ! - My God , it works ! - What 's the matter with him ? It works ! - Are hundreds okay ? - Hundreds ? Hundreds are great . Make them all hundreds , please . Are you all right , sir ? Uh , yeah . Listen , did we just have a conversation ? About you ? Whatever you say . You 're not angry with me ? Sir , could I just finish cashing your check ? There 's a line . Yeah . No . I ... Sorry . What I said must have sounded offbeat , but I 'm having - what you call a strange day . - You , too . Huh ? - You 're having a bad one , too ? - Terrible . Sorry to hear that . No big deal . I always wanted to talk to you , but I never knew what to say . - Why is that ? - I don 't know . You always wear those low-cut tops I mean , it 's a real attention-grabber . But when I look down there all I can think about is your ... I 'm a mess . 120 . Go , go , go ! I really want to get to know the real you . I do . I can 't help thinking about All I 've got on my mind is you in black-lace panties . Okay ! Everybody down ! Everybody on the floor with their face down . Now ! Nobody moves , and nobody gets hurt ! Hands on the fucking floor ! Please ! - Nothing stupid . Stupid people die . - This is your career move . Hey ! Get the hell down ! Ladies and gentlemen , we are here to make a special withdrawal . We don 't want to hurt anybody , but we will if we have to . It 's not your money , so it 's not worth dying for . Not yet . So , stay out of our fucking way ! Get over there ! - Are you the manager ? - Yes . I don 't have the combination . That 's why I got a little time drop . Stay away from that alarm , and get your face on the floor ! Sarah , wait . - Get a grip on yourself ! - I 'd think about that twice ! - FBI . Drop it ! - Shit ! Boss . What ? What do I do now ? I don 't believe it . What you doing with that gun ? I repeat , FBI , you 're all under arrest . Don 't do anything clever , love . You 're a little outnumbered . You heard her . FBI , drop your weapons . No change . Still outnumbered . Not for long . Backup 's on its way . This place 'll be crawling with cops . - I can take her , boss . - And I can take him . Shut up . Nobody shoots anybody . Violence is the last resort . Besides , it don 't come out of the carpet too well . - What you got there ? - Nothing . - Drop that thing right now . - Don 't worry . It 's an ... Hold it ! We do it my fucking way . Get over here . Oh , my God . Make no mistake , or I will kill her . Call an ambulance . - Help me . - Don 't move . Help is coming . Just give me that . This ? Touch it . Get to know you as a person . 1 dollar 47 . Jake . I think I 'm losing my mind . What 's up with Stuart ? Sir ? What can I do for you ? Oh my God . They 're here . They 're outside . What 's going on ? We 've got to stop them . Call it in . People , listen up . Agent Sarah Tanner , FBI . We must all evacuate the building out the side door . Now . She 's right . You 've got to go . Evacuate the building immediately . You 've got to listen to me . Just go out of the back door . You got to go ! You don 't want to go ? Go ! Stuart Conway , you 're under arrest . Okay . Everybody down ! I want everybody on the floor with their face down ! Now ! Nobody moves , and nobody gets hurt ! Down , down down ! Hands on the fucking floor ! Please ! What did you do to us ? Nothing stupid . Stupid people die . Ladies and gentlemen , we are here to make a special withdrawal . We don 't want to hurt anybody , but we will if we have to . It 's not your money , so it 's not worth dying for . So , stay out of our fucking way . Use it again . No . You don 't know what you 're doing . Give it to me . Shut up ! Get a grip on yourself ! - Go outside and stop their van . - What ? Their van , remember ? It 's pulling up in front of the bank . I 'll take that for a souvenir . Looks expensive . Cheers . No . You stay right there . Come on . Good golly , come on ! Come on ! You want to fight ! Come on ! You want to fight ? Come on ! Well , that was brilliant . They were tipped off . Come on , step on it . You stay awake . Hear me ? Just stay awake ! I 'll always be with you . Don 't go . Don 't go . - Up against the wall . Spread your legs . - They 're spread . - Where is it ? - Where 's what ? - That thing that took us back . - What thing ? No games . I want to go back . Take me back ! I wish I could , but that psychopath took it . It 's gone . Hasta la vista . Did you see where they went ? - No ! - You have no idea what I 'm in for at work . What 's the deal , man ? All units : There 's been a multiple vehicle accident on the 54 freeway . A brown van matching the make of one leaving the bank is involved . - That 's them . - Yeah . Proceed with caution . Priority one . You going to arrest me ? I didn 't do anything . Shut up . - Explain to me what it does . - It 's hard to explain . Try me . It 's a temporal displacement device , a translocation unit . In layman 's terms , a time machine . But just a prototype . Going back in time ? Backwards , forwards , theoretically if you had enough funding We can go back in time . We just did , twice . What did you think that was ? Where are we going ? To get it back . Getting it back is good . Then I 'd have it which I shouldn 't have had , but having it would be better . Nice driving , sweetie . Don 't ask for my fare . Put down that gun . Boys , make yourselves at home . We 're going to be here a while . What 's a while ? Until my whirlybird turns up . You always wanted one of those . Good things come to those who wait . Congratulations . You survived a bank robbery . The grand prize is a hostage crisis . Great . Let 's go . Do I have to ? Yeah . My seatbelt ... Get that fucking door shut ! The bus is too crowded . Let 's get half of them off here . It will buy us time . No photo opportunity . Give me that ! You and your granny , get off . These two rows off ! Now ! Dead ringer for McCauley Culkin in the first of " Home Alone . " I thought more like River Phoenix in " Stand by Me . " You 've got such an eye . Tell them what a charmer I am . Sir ! Tanner . What the hell were you and Hallman thinking of ? It better be good enough for every reporter and state official ! - Sir , our target got caught up ... - Get in the car ! Hi . - Who is this ? - That 's our target , sir . Did you recognize any of them ? Negative , sir . They were wearing masks . Maybe we can stall him long enough to think of a way to dig ourselves out of this hole . Sorry about Hallman . Me , too , sir . Creepy dude . Listen , we got to get back that device . If anyone realizes it 's missing , I 'm history . - This is Slipstream , isn 't it ? - How 'd you know ? It 's classified information . Why did you think we were in the bank and I knew your name ? - You were investigating me ? - Somebody thinks you 're a security risk . After what I saw today , I 'd say you 're the risk . - How does it work ? - It uses seams in parallel - Know about String Theory ? - No . - Worm holes ? - No . Never mind . It 's kind of cool . It exploits confluences in the space-time fabric by Can we go back before the bank robbery ? Impossible . - Why ? - We 've never successfully operated outside a 10-minute window . In the bank we went back 3 minutes . 10 minutes ? But Jake 's been gone more than 25 , 30 minutes . Even if I had the unit here , there 's nothing I could do . I 'm sorry . Take five . Who is this guy ? - He 's from Mars . We got nothing on him . - What are you offering him ? Why not start at zero and move down from there . Come on . I 'm bored with this shit . Let 's have a sing along . Go on ! Sing ! Sing ! - Shut up ! - Can you hear me in there ? You 're wasting your time and ours . So , let 's make a deal , and we can all go home . Stupid bastard . It 's always pissing rain in England . Why go home to that ? Right . My offer and my final offer is this : You get me and my men a chopper within 30 minutes , and I won 't kill these nice people in here . Do it . Okay , Runson . Let 's get this party started . - You there , on the other side . Move ! - Move it ! Move the fuck over ! Now ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! - What are you doing out of the car ? - Can you do it ? They 're shooting at us . Get back in . Hold your fucking fire ! Go on ! I need to know . Can it jump back more than 10 minutes ? We tried . We can 't do it . We 've gone through dozens of lab rats We have to work in the 10-minute window . - In theory it is possible . - Yes , but practically , no . Nothing we sent back more than 10 minutes came back alive . - I won 't take no for an answer . - Can we get in ? I can 't take it . You should have thought about that before . Let her go ! Let her go ! She 's one of ours . - " Kid , I gotta tell you something . " - " I 've never shot anybody before . " " Butch Cassidy . " Loved the ending . Just your size . Hey , remember me ? Well , well , well . Fancy seeing you again . And who 's your boyfriend ? Part of our deal . Let these people go and you can have us . Why would I want you ? I 've got something that can get you out of this mess . Sounds exciting . Come a little closer . I won 't bite . I don 't think so . I don 't like him . He goes . You stay . We 're a package deal . Take it or leave it . I 'll leave it . You better get on the bus , love . - I can 't get rid of you , can I ? - Who 's this ? The bitch from the bank . She 's persistent . I 'll give her that . I don 't like brunettes . Listen to me . That guy you just shot had a small electronic device . It looks like a PDA , but it isn 't . - Know what I 'm talking about ? - This . There are files on it that affect our national security . That 's all I want . Give me that , and you get your chopper . Show me . Just you . No one else can hear . I won 't be a minute , pet . Step into my office . Just in case something happens here , it 's only fair to let you know I 've been engaged to that lovely , heavily-armed lady for 12 years . - I 'm sure we can work around it . - Use that pretty mouth of yours . This device , you can clean out any bank in the world with it . How ? A black box project . Government 's discretionary fund . Stealth technology . Wars aren 't only fought with guns . The Falklands , Britain infiltrated Argentinian stock markets . It nearly wiped the country out . It never recovered . - Looks like a computer phonebook . - It 's meant to . But this baby can transfer any amount of cash from any bank into any account untraced . The money simply disappears . Whose idea was this ? NSA , CIA , Homeland Security . Take your pick . - Perfect for destabilizing unfriendly governments . - Who do you work for ? FBI . We were following the dead guy outside . He was about to make an unauthorized transfer into an offshore account . - And you 're telling me this ... - Because you got what I want . - Let 's make a deal . - Why do I need you ? I know how to use it . You don 't . I propose a 50-50 split . I 'm supposed to believe an FBI agent ? I work 70 hours a week for 46,000 dollars a year . - Can you blame me ? - You know what ? - You know what ? - What ? I think you 're full of shit . We 're a package deal . Take it or Stone me ! - What just happened ? - You were dead . He shot you . Again ? Will you please stop shooting me ? I 'll shoot both of you this time . Get on the bus . I 'll have that . Come on . Nice story . - Now I want the truth . - I told you . No . From him . - What do you want to know ? - Either I 'm dolally , or I went back in time . What are you on ? Shut up a minute , pet . Now , how does this time machine work ? It 's not a time machine . It 's a poly - dimensional translocation device . English ! - A time machine . - Why can I remember and she can 't ? She 's got to be touching it or someone who 's touching it , or else she won 't intercept ... She won 't jump back in time . So , it 's a time machine . Take us back to yesterday . - I can 't do that . - Then to the bank . We 'll walk back in - and get double the money . - As long as you maintain contact You naughty boy ! That 's what you was doing there . - Now take us back . - I 'm trying to explain it . You can 't ! There 's a 10-minute time limit . Maximum . Maybe I 'm not explaining it properly . I 'll tell you what I told her , alright ? It 's impossible ! How the hell do I get out of this ? What 's your name , love ? - Sarah . - Well , Sarah . Here we are , the 20 of us . Looks like we 're out of luck , yet in a position to help each other . You get your box back and go back in time , but only when I get a chopper out of here . Don 't take all day thinking about it , love . Once in a helicopter with guaranteed flight clearance , - they 'll release the hostages . - Can 't do it . It 's not procedure . Listen , you 've got 30 seconds to decide if you want these people alive or carried out in bodybags . Okay . You 'll have a chopper here in 30 minutes . When I see the helicopter landing , I 'll release most of the hostages . To insure our safety , I 'll keep a few hostages until I 'm on the bird . Do you understand ? What does a man do to get a cup of tea around here ? Come here . Like Bonnie and Clyde on mescaline . Their parents must be proud . Is that what I think it is ? Yeah . Stuart , help me get this straight . Whenever you make it work , whoever 's touching it or touching them will go back in time ? Yeah , and what you 're wearing . Clothes , watch , anything you touch . - And nobody remembers , right ? - That 's right . That is right . Jake didn 't remember when the bank got robbed the first time , and you didn 't remember anything outside the bus . Why aren 't the bullets still in you ? They must have just passed right through me . Armor-piercing rounds . - You 're lucky . - Easy for you to say . - Do you have any wounds ? - No . My body goes back in time , reversing anything that happened . I shaved a rat and sent it back . It came back hairy . Lights out . The hostages are clear . Your chopper is ready . Sir . - I just want to go home . - Stay calm . Please , don 't move . - Then this stuff happens . - Sir , I need to concentrate . - Please , get this thing off ! - I will . I said , your chopper is ready . My wife was making me a casserole . - I have to concentrate . - Get this thing off . Get it off ! No ! No ! No I don 't want to die ! - Please ! I don 't want to die ! - No ! Please , God ! Help ! Sick bastards . You all right ? I don 't think so . Take a breather . Right here , mate . Remember the last scene in " Butch Cassidy " ? Butch and Sundance . At the end of the road . Holed up in a bank in Santiago somewhere . Whole Bolivian army waiting outside . Two divisions waiting for them to come out of the bank . And then , they do . They burst through the doors into the sunlight . They come out into the sunlight with everything they 've got . Guns blazing . Bring her back ! What ? Bring her back ! No ! Get moving ! I 'm not asking . I can 't get it to work . It 's broken . You 've got 7 minutes . Six . You 'd better get it working . Stop ! I 'm out of service . Don 't you see the light ? You 're back in service now . Gillian Barker . Partner to Winston Briggs , in life and crime . A couple of wild-eyed murderers . Robbing banks up and down the West coast . Sir , we found another one . Be with you in a minute . Be with you in a minute , too . Wait . Okay . Oh shit , the plane tickets ! Gill had them . What a miserable fucking day ! - Why have you stopped working ? - We passed the window . Sorry . I 'm a bit deaf . I didn 't hear you right . I 've been trying to tell you . We have a finite window 10 minutes wide . We 're beyond it . Build your self-confidence , boy . Travel more . Know what I mean ? Great advice . Move it . What are you doing ? I 'm not moving . For the past 5 hours I 've been arrested , taken hostage , shot twice , and killed once . Not to mention the nonfat soy foodarama thrown in my face by the woman I sexually fantasized about . I 've had enough ! You can have it . Thank you . Don 't whine to me about the rotten day you 've had . I 've lost everything today because of you . Now get a fucking move on . Tanner . I know you and Hallman were close , but there 's not much room for that in the Bureau . Believe me . You went your own way , and sometimes it works . But not this time . I 'm going to need your gun and your badge , Sarah . Leave them on my desk in the morning . Yes , sir . FLIGHT PERSONNEL ONLY Agent Tanner , FBI . I need a quick look on that flight . Thank you . Sorry . Run , rabbit , run . You 're very brave sitting next to me . Most people don 't want to sit next to a crying baby . You 're lucky we had extra seats . This flight 's usually full . Must be my lucky day . I love that accent . Where are you from ? Little Gidding . An eel-fishing town outside London . Glad to be out of it really . Ever tried eel ? - Eels ? Don 't think I have . - You should . They 're very tasty . I thought I knew all the pilots on this route . I 'm not on this route . - Caliber has one route . - You 've got lovely eyes . And so do you . - Do you have any kids ? - No . You have to find the right man . That 's the hard part . I had one . I 'm afraid I lost him . You can get him back . I 'd bet my life on that . I don 't think so . But if you love him , don 't give up . I ended with Jenny 's dad , and I wish I had tried harder . - Come out of there , little git . - Yeah , alright . In a minute . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to Caliber Airlines , Flight 19 , to Acapulco . To operate your seatbelts , insert the metal tab If you don 't know how , you probably shouldn 't be out in public . In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure ... I saw you get on late . Nervous about flying ? Oh , yeah . I always get jumpy when I get on a plane . Me , too . I try not to show it , because she 'll pick up on it . Sir , switch the video game off . You should know that . Some people never grow up . Not a word to anyone . What 's wrong with you ? Just scoot over a little ? I 'm dying here . What ? - I have to use ... - You 've already been . I have to go again . Call it the gravitational pull of the bladder . A nervous condition caused by stress . Want to find out the hard way , just sit there . Put the chicken in the oven . Some passengers need a little talking to . Sure . Leave that with me . What ? What are you going to do ? Make sure there 's a greeting party when he gets off the plane and not another hostage situation . Good . I think I have a theory about the machine . It was dead. it just powered up . I think I know why . Why ? At this altitude we got a direct line to all the cell towers we pass over . - So ? - So We can get enough power to get back beyond the window . With one minor reservation . - Anything can happen ? - Yeah . Stuart , tell me something I don 't know already . We just have to get it back from that gorilla . Leave that to me . Grant ? You 're not Grant Robert . I know Grant . Grant P. Robert . Know what the P stands for ? Piss off ! Listen , I don 't need to take that kind of talk from you . You 're not the captain on this flight . Don 't get your knickers in a twist . Get me a large scotch with ice . And another pillow . You fat bastard . Oh my God , she 's got a gun ! - Federal Air Marshall . Put it down ! - FBI . Lower your weapon ! Don 't you fucking move . We 've got an FBI agent with a gun . - The air marshal ? - No , a real fed . At least , I hope so . You got it working ? It 's powered up , but I don 't know if it 's working . Show me ! You have to fix it ! I can 't ! You can 't , or you won 't ? You don 't want to hear this now , but this is awesome ! Wake up , Stuart . We 're all gonna die . Right , the plane 's crashing . I have to think of something . Give me that . Can I use your computer ? I need the cable for Firewire . The screen is broken . I 'm not sure it 's gonna work . I 'll do my best . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . I think it 's working . No . Wait . He 's got it working . Are hundreds okay ? Are you a pilot ? Weren 't you just What happened to your jacket ? What the hell is he wearing ? Bloody hell ! You 're not going to wear that ? I 'll tell you what , lads . We 're going to abort this job . Best instincts in the business . - It 's like having a crystal ball . - A pair of them . Take us home , pet . Jake ? It 's okay . Sarah , what the hell is happening ? I can 't say too much . It 's a classified government job in theoretical physics . There have been some cutbacks . I still have my job though . No way . I 'm a Physics major . Sounds like a dream job . It sure beats working in a bank . And you 're a pilot , too ? You must be busy . You know , Margaret , from the first time I saw you I had this feeling that No matter how many times I say this , it 's never going to get better . Coffee ? Twin nonfat soy foodaramas , just you and me , somewhere ? Would you consider it ? If you 're interested , you can instant message me . Okay . That sounds really nice . Really ? It 's my handle , Stuartbombsom . Thanks . See you . Sarah , you have to explain this to me . I 'm either going crazy , or this is a dream . Don 't worry . It 's so much better than a dream . I 'm glad you 're here . I 've been meaning to talk to you . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - I 'm starving . - We just ate an hour ago . Really ?

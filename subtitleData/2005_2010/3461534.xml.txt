Rebel promised . Well , he lied . Now get out . Please . I can 't go back out there . Claire ? You okay ? Oh , my god . Mom. it 's all right . Mr. Doyle here was just leaving . No , please . They 'll catch me . Rebel said you could help me start over , And that 's all I want- - To go back to being a puppeteer , Making people happy . And you thought I would help you ? After what you did ? You should know there are agents Parked outside this house . Actually , they 're not . Rebel set a fake call , Which they 'll figure out any minute now . But if there were agents outside ... Why aren 't they kicking in the door , Looking to collect a comes-back-to-life barbie ? They gave me a free pass , But they will come after me If i try to help anyone . So you turn your back on your own kind , While we 're all out there being hunted down ? They burned down my theater while I was still inside . And you tried to kill us , you- - ! You and your free pass . You have no idea what it 's like To be hunted , To live on the street , To break into the home of the last person on earth You 'd expect to help you Because she was your only hope . I thought ... I 'm not gonna force you to help me , claire . That 's not who I am anymore . Where the hell have you been ? Dealing with the mess your brother left us . There wouldn 't have been a mess If you 'd released Parkman and Millbrook Like I asked you to . I made the right choice . Peter just got lucky . Though I have wondered How many people knew he was on that rooftop . Petrelli . What ? Yeah , I 'm on my way . I thought Parkman was in your custody . He was last time I checked . Well , what the hell 's he doing In front of the capitol building With a bomb strapped to his chest ? No , no , no . Deactivate the device now , Then lie face down . I don 't know if I try and pull this it 's g- - I didn 't do this . I was set up ! Senator Nathan Petrelli . Sir , this is a very dangerous situation . I can 't- - Lieutenant , I know that man . I can get through to him . You got five minutes . Parkman ! You son of a bitch . Don 't you come any closer to me . - Everything gonna be all right . - No , it 's not ! You turned me into a terrorist . I didn 't sanction this . That was Danko . He 's got an agenda . - You lie to me . - Believe me , Matt . Use your power . Read my mind . I 'm telling you the truth . I can 't . I can 't . They drugged me . Gonna have to trust me , Matt . Parkman 's vest is ready , sir , but we have a problem here . Petrelli . How 'd he get there so fast ? Is the device armed ? We 're all set . Senator wants to play hero ... He can be a martyr to his own cause . Take them out . Weapon activated Do it . Take him out . Now . I don 'tnow where this came from ! I 'm gonna blow up ! We 've been kicked out . Get it back . Now . ... though there are those who believe That he may know the bomber personally . What 's goin ' on here ? Come on . We 're losin ' our window . I 'm routing through a different server . Matt , if we don 't disarm you , they 're gonna shoot you . There are a lot of bomb techs around here . I 'm sure one of them Is thinking about how to disarm that . Get inside his head . The drugs are starting to wear off , but I don 't think- - What 's he thinking ? Running out of time . Red wire . Red wire . Doesn 't make any sense . Why would a suicide bomber bother with dummy wire ? - Don 't touch red wire . - I 'm not touching anything . We have to take the shot ! Just hang on . It 's all right , Matt , take your time . Black wire is the key . - Black wire . - Black wire . Okay . Do i pull the black wire , Or is that the one i don 't pull ? He 's not thinkin ' directly about it . I gotta dig deeper. hold on ! I got it. we 're back up . Weapon armed , sir . Matt , i 'm gonna pull it . Danko . I said do it . Wait ! Damn it ! Sorry , Matt . I can 't have you usin ' your power . It 's open . Almost got the order ready . You have a lot of pickups today ? I 'm not here for a pickup . No ? It 's me . Gabriel . Your son . Is that so ? That is so . What brings you all the way out here ? I had some questions about myself ... Who i am , Where i came from . But then i remembered . You abandoned me . You killed my mother . So ? What now ? Now ? I kill you . Go right ahead . You kill me , or the cancer does . Either way , i die . I haven 't got all day . Anything ? This guy 's good . There 's no sign the system was even breached . I wanna know how the hell he 's getting inside , And i want a name . Me too . So we can thank them For saving us from this disaster . Of course , Since the safety of your friends and family Evidently trumps national security . Parkman wasn 't a threat Until you strapped a bomb to him . Parkman and your brother exposed our operations , So I handled it , Put a face to the terrorist threat . People could have died . People have died , senator , Or don 't my men count ? I was brought in to get this job done . I 'd let go of that if I were you . You 're relieved of command . I answer to the president . You try to get rid of me , he 's gonna want proof , And right now it 's my word against yours . Good luck getting any of my people to turn on me . We 'll see. excuse me . Bennet , you have a minute ? I 'm not sure how much i can tell ya About what happened . I know what happened last night . I wanna talk to you about putting a team together Once Danko 's gone . You 're one of us , Nathan . You 're one of us ! You 're one of us , Nathan . Do you have a point ? That maybe this operation Has been compromised from the start . The Petrelli family has a lot of skeletons In their closet , senator . I think we both know what yours is . So ... looks like we 're both building a case Against each other . Let 's see who gets there first . You 're one of us , Nathan . You 're one of us ! Son of a bitch went over my head . What do you expect ? You backed a wild dog into a corner . But you didn 't act . All you did was show Danko your hand , And , frankly , you put both of us at risk . I had a plan , though . Nathan , listen to me . He 's pushing your buttons So that you 'll make a mistake . Take a play from your mother 's book . Keep your head . Sorry about all this . I find that hard to believe . The man who transferred you back here Is gonna come in in a few moments And ask you some questions . I was wondering when that was gonna happen . I know this might seem hard to believe , Well , that makes one of us . Come on. you 're smarter than that . You might not realize it , But i have been helping you out all along . You and everyone else . And doing a fabulous job of it . You remember when you jumped off the bridge and i was there ? I 'm still the same guy . You sacrificed me for your own personal gain . You don 't have to like me , But you do have to understand that i am your last hope . That 's my prisoner . Got a soft spot for this one , Petrelli ? Wanna make sure i don 't get too rough with her ? No , no. knock yourself out . I wanna know everything you know about Nathan Petrelli . He was lousy in bed . I wanna know what you meant When you said he was " one of us . " Does Nathan have an ability ? An ability ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . You wanna talk about it ? Should i have helped Doyle ? That puppet man Is a sick and twisted individual , Claire . You did the right thing . I have a free pass for a reason . I should be using it to help people . Rebel seems to think so . Yes , well , this rebel , whoever he is , Can 't send psychopaths to our front doorstep . I don 't think i can take any more surprise guests . Right , which is why I was thinking That I should have a cover job . I mean , with Alex gone , They 're probably gonna need someone to fill his job At the comic book store , And I could help whoever rebel sends , And no more surprise guests for you and Lyle . Boy , Claire , I don 't know . I guess so . If it 's what you want to do . Thanks . So , you don 't have any retail experience ? Um , does a cheerleading bake sale count ? Uh , you 're a cheerleader ? Yeah , I was . All right , so let me as you a few questions . Can you work wednesdays ? Wednesdays ? Wednesdays are when all the new comics arrive . Wednesday is good for me . Flight or invisibility ? I 'm sorry . What ? Do you throw caution to the wind And fly off to save the day , Or do you take the more calculated approach And learn the whole picture before you act ? What 's the answer ? There isn 't one . That 's why it 's the question . Put simply- - what type of hero are you ? I don 't know . Whoa , hey , hey . You 're not gonna cry are you ? It--it 's okay , really . They 're only comic books , i mean ... I 'm gonna stop bothering you . Uh , thank you for letting me interview , anyway . What are you talking about ? You got the job . I did ? Every guy in the store 's been staring at you Since you walked in . You will absolutely sell comic books , And the other stuff we can work on . You 're still here . This is pitiful . What 's that ? What you 've become . You used to be a killer . Now look at you . You 're pathetic . Oh . You want a fight . Is that what you were expecting ? Son kills his father ? Epic battle ? Ah , that 's a myth . No , life- - Life never gives you what you want . Give me a hand with this . Maybe i can explain it to ya . Now , when i open the trap , He 's gonna bolt , So grab him from the back , all right ? You have an ability . Got lots of ' em . Don 't know what i got left . Been years since i used ' em- - Or needed ' em . You have the same thing- - Taking people 's abilities . Am i right ? Guess the apple didn 't fall too far from the tree . I 'm not your apple. you don 't know anything about me . I have some idea . You and i , we can 't be all that different . From where i stand , We have exactly nothing in common . Yeah , well , we pick easy targets . Like that rabbit--weak , helpless . Not fair , really . Are you really drawing a moral line ? Morality doesn 't figure into it . Fish gotta swim , birds gotta fly . You have to kill . It 's who you are . But you do choose your prey , And yours never had a chance , not against you . Not really . Easy pickin 's . Small game . They had something i wanted . It isn 't my fault If they weren 't strong enough to fight back . And those agents That have been comin ' after us recently ? I handled them . No , you ran away from ' em . Just like i did . I could wipe them out with a thought . But you haven 't . Why ? You know , there 'll come a day , Maybe tomorrow or next week , next year , When you realize the hunt your entire life , Was meaningless and disappointing , cause there 's no challenge in it . You know , all the power in the world doesn 't matter If you 've lived an unsatisfied life . And I think you know that already , don 't you ? You wanna know more , or ... You gonna kill me now ? What do i do ? Gut him . While you were at Primatech Did you come across anyone who could fly ? Plenty , But you know that . It 's in the files . I 'm guessing a few were missing . The facility burned to the ground . Who knows what was lost ? That must have been tough for you . 20 years on the job . I 'm sure you 've been close to the Petrelli family . The Petrellis were never exactly A warm and fuzzy bunch . You adopted the senator 's daughter . I didn 't know she was his at the time , And neither did he , for that matter . We both know Nathan Petrelli is hiding something . You know what question you should be asking yourself ? " Who would want to save Peter ? " His mother ? Angela ? You wanna know what 's missing from the files ? Who can fly ? She 'd never betray her own son . A long time ago , I gave up trying to figure out What Angela Petrelli would or wouldn 't do . Go ahead . We 've got a problem . Nathan 's made a power play against Danko . He 's stirred up a hornet 's nest . It 's nice to know a mother still has some influence Over her son . Things will be better for us with Danko gone . Of course they will , but Nathan 's on thin ice . He 's moving too fast , and Danko 's unpredictable . The man nearly killed Peter . It had to be done . Be prepared then , 'Cause I pointed him in your direction . Be careful . He does his homework . So do I. Homework . Thank you . See you tomorrow . - See you Claire . - Bye . Claire . You all right ? Everything okay at home ? Yeah . That 's not what this is about . I have a question , And I really need you to answer it . Okay . How did you lead two lives for all that time ? I can 't always be myself , And I just don 't know who I 'm supposed to be . Honestly , Claire , I 'm the worst person to ask . So how am I supposed to decide which path to take ? Which answer do you want ? Do you want the one That 's gonna make you feel better , Or do you want the truth ? I don 't know . Well , then my answer is " neither do I. " Thanks . I miss you , Claire bear . Doyle ! Freeze ! Put your hands over your head . Whatever you say . When are you gonna learn ? I have this effect on women . Doyle , I 'm giving you a chance to surrender . I should kill you ... But I just wanna go back to the way life was . All right , Doyle . Barbie ? Mrs. Petrelli . My name is ... Mr. Danko . I was hoping you could help me . Well , everything I know about the people you 're after Is in the Primatech files . I 'm not interested in files . Elle Bishop , Hiro Nakamura , Matt Parkman , All inherited abilities from their parents , As did Peter and Claire . Well , genetics Is an extremely complex topic , Mr. Danko . Did you know that two blue-eyed parents Can sometimes have a brown-eyed child ? So Nathan ... Was the misfit ? Sometimes these things skip a generation . I don 't believe you . I 've met many men like you , Mr. Danko . Our company employed dozens of them- - No family , nothing to hold you back . You operate in the shadows , Doing all the awful things other people just refuse to do . It 's what makes you useful . And expendable . Really ? That incident in Angola ? 1997 , I believe . All those civilians lost . Tragic . I 'm surprised you survived , actually . You 're a very ... resourceful woman , Mrs. Petrelli . A man needs a hobby , Somethin ' to occupy the hands , To stop the mind from thinkin ' so much . I fix watches . Watches ? Thought it would make my father happy . How 'd that work out for you ? You 're still clinging to that need for connection , huh ? The only thing people are good for is disappointment . Is that why you killed my mother ? Why you abandoned me ? I don 't even remember . Didn 't matter to me . So few things do . Well , now what ? Cut the thread . How 'd you do that ? It 's just an ability I picked up From a cheerleader in California . I guess not everybody gets old . Not everybody dies . Then you just have That much longer to suffer , don 't ya ? Get that . It needs to settle . Over there on that cabinet , if you don 't mind . Sure . What the hell are you doing ? It 's amazing how it comes right back , That desire , that hunger . You think this is gonna stop me ? You think you can beat me ? I want that power ! I thought you 'd given up . Yeah , well , me too . Then why bother ? What 's the point ? Immortality . You 're my second chance . At what ? Killing again ? You said it was meaningless . It was . Then why make the same mistake twice ? Because i 'll get it right this time , Do more , be more , Take every challenge , Fight hard , risk it all , Take real power , real authority , Change everything--the world , Just to see if I can . You can move . I can . You 're the hunter . I thought you would know When someone was playing possum , When the prey isn 't so weak , So easy . Please ... I need that power . I don 't wanna die . No , no , no , of course not . Of course you don 't . It won 't kill you if I take it . You 'll heal . You 'll be fine . Yeah , but so will you . No. don 't ... leave . Like I said , I came here to kill you . I got the answers I wanted . Now I know exactly what I need to do . Kill me . Oh , you 're gonna die . Slowly ... painfully ... And alone with your sickness . Please ... Don 't . I 'm sorry . You 're just a small game . Turns out the president Didn 't really need that much proof after all . It 's a signed document . You 're finished . You lose me , you lose the whole team . Well , that 's a risk i 'm prepared to take . In fact , anyone who 's not on board Can step out now . You 're hitting reset on the whole operation Just because of me ? Well , I think it 's time things were done correctly . You may have friends now , Petrelli , But one day you 're gonna find yourself all alone . You went to the president ? Mm-hmm , and he is eager To meet danko 's replacement . You comin ' ? They say you 're the man with the plan . I sure hope you have something good To share with the president . It 's a bit unorthodox , but it 's tested . Look , it 's over . Just let it go . When are you gonna understand ? Bureaucracy , oversight , rules of conduct , None of it applies in my world . I don 't know what your world is , But it ought to be shut down . Danko , take it easy . I 've seen what these people can do , And it scares me . And the thing about you , senator , Is that through all this , You 've never once shown an ounce of fear , And I wonder ... Why is that ? I don 't have time for this . Tell me you know about this . This is it- - your new identity , Everything you need to start over . Rebel 's erased any trace of Eric Doyle . You saw me spare that agent 's life . Is that it ? Have I earned your help ? This isn 't about you . This is about me , About who i need to be right now , And i don 't ... Just take it . Thanks , barbie . Did you mean all that stuff you said About how you 'd changed ? Hiro Ando , Los Angeles , California You sure this is the place ? 63 Varna Avenue Doesn 't look like anyone needs to be saved . Looks can be deceiving , my friend . Somewhere inside this house , Matt Parkman ... could be in mortal danger . Finally . I quit , and it takes the service Two hours to find a replacement ? Well , don 't just stand there . Come in . I 'm desperate . Excuse me , please . We are looking for Matt Parkman . No duh . Anyway , he 's a mess . Matt Parkman 's a mess ? Here you go . Diaper 's clean , but that won 't hold . Take it . Take it . No , thank you . Now . W--hey , wait . We are here to save matt parkman . Uh-huh . You 're holding him . Matt parkman ? Lots of luck . You 're gonna need it . And by the way , This baby sitting service bites . Generations unfold- - Father to son , mother to daughter . Where one leaves off , the other follows , Destined to repeat each other 's mistakes , Rebel : Your free pass is up . Agents are coming . Each other 's triumphs . For how do we see the world If not through their lens ? The same fears , the same desires ? Do we see them as an example to follow , Or as a warning of what to avoid ? Choosing to live as they have Simply because it 's what we know , Or driven to create one 's own identity ? And what happens when we find them To be a disappointment ? Can we replace them ? Our mothers , our fathers ? Or will destiny find a way to drive us back ? Back to the familiar comforts of home ? To be continued ...

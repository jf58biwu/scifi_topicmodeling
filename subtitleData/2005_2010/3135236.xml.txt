 The 4400 S04E05 THE WORLD WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US . PREVIOUSLY ON THE 4400 ... [ LENHOFF ] : YOU 'RE THE ALTERNATIVE WE NEED TO COLLIER AND HIS PROMICIN-PUSHING RADICALS . DOES THAT MEAN YOU 'LL RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL ? IT MEANS I 'M GOING TO RUN AND I 'M GOING TO WIN . PROMICIN IS OUT THERE . PEOPLE ARE GAINING ABILITIES , AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT . [ TOM ] : WHO 'S CASSIE ? I 'M NOT WHAT YOU 'D CALL REAL . I 'M KYLE 'S ABILITY . EVERYTHING IN THAT BOOK IS GOING TO COME TRUE . COLLIER WILL LEAD THE HUMAN RACE TO SALVATION . YOU WILL HELP HIM . ISABELLE TYLER ... I 'VE DONE BAD THINGS , AND I 'M SUPPOSED TO DO MORE . I WAS SENT TO HELP YOU GET AWAY . THIS IS ALL HAPPENING FOR A REASON . DO YOU BELIEVE THAT JORDAN COLLIER IS A MESSIAH , AND THAT PROMICIN 'S GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD ? KYLE , LISTEN TO ME , IF YOU 'RE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING ... [ MARCO ] : THE LAB REPORT YOU ASKED FOR , THE SAMPLES CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR PROMICIN . HEY , KYLE ! KYLE ? HEY , DAD , WHAT 'S UP ? WHERE ARE YOU , KYLE ? IS SOMETHING WRONG ? I NEED TO TALK TO YOU , BUDDY . IT 'S IMPORTANT , BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT IN PERSON . CAN YOU COME HOME NOW ? SURE , YEAH . I CAN BE HOME IN , LIKE , 20 MINUTES OR SOMETHING . WHAT 'S WRONG ? 20 MINUTES . I 'LL BE HERE . YOU CAN 'T GO BACK THERE , KYLE . HE KNOWS . KNOWS WHAT ? WHAT DO YOU THINK ? YOUR FATHER KNOWS YOU TOOK THE PROMICIN SHOT . WHAT 'S HE GOING TO DO ? IS HE GOING TO TELL NTAC ? IF I CAN 'T GO HOME , WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ? WHERE DO I LIVE ? YOU CAN MOVE ON NOW . MOVE WHERE ? YOU 'RE HEADING NORTH . TAKE HIGHWAY 99 UNTIL IT CROSSES WITH RURAL ROUTE 57 . FOLLOW THAT , AND YOU 'LL FIND AN OLD LOGGING PASS . WHEN IT ENDS , GET OUT AND START WALKING DUE WEST . WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR ? GO THERE . ENJOY THE SURPRISE . HEY ... I HEARD TALKING . IS EVERYTHING OKAY ? UH ... YOU HAVE TO GET READY , OKAY ? WE 'RE LEAVING . DON 'T LET THEM TAKE ME ! MAIA ... OH , SWEETIE . IT 'S OKAY . SWEETHEART , IT 'S OKAY . NOBODY 'S TAKING YOU ANYWHERE . YOU JUST HAD A NIGHTMARE . IT 'S LIKE A PRISON . ALL THE PEOPLE WITH ABILITIES ARE THERE . THEY MAKE US LINE UP , THEN THEY TAKE US AWAY , SOMEPLACE BAD . WHAT KIND OF PLACE ? YOU 'VE HAD THIS DREAM BEFORE . THAT WAS THE SECOND TIME . I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO GO AWAY , BUT IT DIDN 'T . IT 'S OKAY , SWEETIE . COME HERE . IT 'S OKAY , BABY . WHAT ARE WE EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR ? WE 'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE . CASSIE SAID TO COME HERE . THAT MEANS THERE 'S SOMETHING HERE . THAT CELL TOWER SERVICES THE ENTIRE AREA . AND YOU 'RE POSITIVE THAT 'S THE FINAL SIGNAL FROM MY SON 'S PHONE ? ALL RIGHT . ALL RIGHT , THANKS . GOD , JUST FOR ONCE I 'D LIKE TO BEAT YOU IN HERE . DIANA ... LISTEN , I HAVE TO LEAVE FOR A WHILE . KYLE 'S IN TROUBLE . IS HE ? WHAT 'S WRONG ? I CAN 'T GET INTO IT , BUT I HAVE TO FIND HIM , AND I NEED YOU TO COVER FOR ME . LOOK , I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH KYLE 'S WIRELESS CARRIER . THE LAST SIGNAL FROM HIS CELL PHONE CAME FROM ABOUT FOUR HOURS AWAY , SO IT COULD BE A WHILE . MAYBE EVEN A DAY OR TWO . WELL , TELL ME WHAT 'S WRONG . I 'D LIKE TO HELP . THE BEST HELP YOU COULD GIVE ME IS TO COVER MY BACK . TELL ANYONE WHO ASKS THAT I 'M IN THE FIELD ON ONE OF OUR CASES , ALL RIGHT ? OKAY . I 'LL CALL YOU WHEN I FIND HIM . TOM ? GOOD LUCK . THANKS . OH , MY GOD . OH , MY GOD . YOU TRAPPED ME . YOU LED ME RIGHT TO HIM . HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE ? I TOOK THE SHOT . I 'VE BEEN HAVING THESE VISIONS . THEY LED ME TO YOU . THEY TOLD ME I HAVE TO BRING YOU SOMETHING . HEY , IT 'S JUST A BOOK , MAN . ALL RIGHT , IT 'S IMPORTANT . IT 'S ABOUT YOU . YOU HAVE TO READ IT . THERE WAS THIS RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT ABOUT 90 YEARS AGO . WHITE LIGHT , THEY CALLED IT A CULT . THIS BOOK WAS THEIR PROPHECY . IT 'S ALL ABOUT PROMICIN , THE MOVEMENT . IT 'S THE REASON I 'M SUPPOSED TO FIND YOU . AND HER ? WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO LEAD ISABELLE TYLER TO ME AS WELL ? I WAS GUIDED TO HER THE SAME WAY I WAS GUIDED TO YOU . SHE 'S GOING TO HELP US WITH THE MOVEMENT , JORDAN . I 'M NOT A THREAT TO YOU . I DON 'T HAVE MY ABILITIES ANYMORE . WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO FOR ME ? I DON 'T KNOW . THAT 'S YOU . I 'M TELLING YOU , IT 'S ALL ABOUT YOU . BRING THEM . MR. FARRELL HAS BEEN HANDED THIS REMARKABLE ABILITY , BUT HE HIMSELF IS SIMPLY NOT THAT DISTINGUISHED OF A YOUNG MAN . NOW , EVEN IF HE WAS THE SECOND COMING OF ROBERT KENNEDY , I WOULD STILL SAY THAT A 4400 HAS NO BUSINESS RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE . TODAY 'S CLIPPINGS . DO I WANT TO READ TODAY 'S CLIPPINGS ? EVERYONE RESPECTS YOUR HEALING WORK , BUT THEY 'RE CALLING YOU OUT ON YOUR AGE , YOUR INEXPERIENCE , YOUR LACK OF EDUCATION , YOUR CONNECTIONS WITH JORDAN COLLIER- - I GET IT , I GET IT . IT 'S JUST , DO I REALLY HAVE TO STUDY MY OWN SHORTCOMINGS ? THAT 'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW . YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER THINKS YOU DO . SHE GOT YOU A MEETING WITH GABRIEL HEWITT LATER TODAY , AND YOU 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REFUTE HIS ... TALKING POINTS . ONE BY ONE . I HAVE TO HAVE A SIT-DOWN WITH THE MAN THAT 'S BEEN BADMOUTHING ME TO ANYBODY THAT WILL PUT A CAMERA IN HIS FACE ? I THINK THE IDEA IS TO WIN HIM OVER . TELL HIM ABOUT THE FOUNDATION . CONVINCE HIM YOU ARE NOT SOME PAWN OF JORDAN COLLIER . I ADMIRE YOU , KYLE . GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND , IT MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO TAKE THE PROMICIN SHOT . BUT I 'VE READ YOUR BOOK . IT 'S WRONG . I 'M NO MESSIAH . I KNOW HOW IT SOUNDS . IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE , TOO . I 'M NOBODY 'S RELIGIOUS NUT , BUT THESE VISIONS I HAVE ARE NEVER WRONG , NOT ONCE , AND IF THEY SAY THAT BOOK IS IMPORTANT , I HAVE TO BELIEVE IT . I HAVE TO BELIEVE WHAT 'S IN THERE . PROMICIN ISN 'T JUST HERE TO IMPROVE THE WORLD , JORDAN . IT 'S HERE TO BRING HEAVEN TO EARTH . I DON 'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS , BUT ... YOU 'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN , AND I 'M SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU . IT 'S LIKE IT SAYS IN THE BOOK . YOU ARE GOING TO LEAD US ALL TO GOD . UNTIE HIM . WE 'LL CONTINUE THIS SOMEWHERE MORE COMFORTABLE . WHAT ABOUT ME ? I 'LL DEAL WITH YOU SOON ENOUGH . GOODNESS ME , A CUSTOMER I DON 'T RECOGNIZE . WILL WONDERS EVER CEASE ? I GUESS YOU DON 'T GET MANY VISITORS HERE . THIS TOWN ISN 'T EVEN ON MY MAP . THAT HIGHWAY TWO WENT IN A FEW YEARS BACK . SINCE THEN , WE 'VE BEEN A LITTLE SHORT ON VISITORS , BUT IT 'S A TREAT TO HAVE ONE AS HANDSOME AS YOU . KATHY , WOULD YOU STOP FLIRTING WITH THE POOR MAN , SEE IF HE WANTS SOME LUNCH ? I 'M GOOD . THANKS . YOU DON 'T COME ALL THIS WAY TO SKIP MY FAMOUS APPLE PIE . TELL THE MAN , WILL YOU , SHANNON ? KATHY MAKES A MEAN APPLE PIE . IT 'S THE HOUSE SPECIALTY . I 'M SURE SHE DOES . LOOK , I WISH I HAD TIME . ACTUALLY , I WAS HOPING TO FIND THE SHERIFF . THERE WAS A NOTE ON THE DOOR . HE SHOULD JUST MOVE HIS OFFICE IN HERE . THANKS . MY SON 'S DRIVING A GREEN SATURN . WELL , THERE 'S NOT MUCH REASON TO COME OUT HERE , BUT IF I DO SEE IT , I 'LL DEFINITELY GIVE YOU A CALL . NOW , IF YOUR BOY DID PASS THROUGH HERE , I 'M SURE HE 'S MOVED ON BY NOW . BUT YOU 'RE WELCOME TO HAVE A WANDER , ASK AROUND . I APPRECIATE THAT , SHERIFF , THANKS . NOT A PROBLEM . IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN GET YOU FOR THE ROAD ? YOU SHOULD TRY THE PIE , MISTER . IT 'S REALLY GOOD . I 'LL PASS , BUT THANKS . YOU SURE ? YEAH . BYE . BYE . SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS ARE WE JUST TALKING ABOUT A KID 'S RECURRING NIGHTMARE , OR IS IT SOMETHING WORSE ? WELL , OBVIOUSLY , I 'M PULLING FOR NIGHTMARES . MAIA 'S VISIONS DON 'T USUALLY HAPPEN WHILE SHE 'S SLEEPING , AND SHE WASN 'T SEEING THIS WHILE WE WERE IN SPAIN . I MEAN , THE HEADLINES AREN 'T EXACTLY REASSURING AND THEY 'RE A LOT MORE IMMEDIATE WHEN YOUR MOM BRINGS YOU BACK TO THE FRONT LINES . MAYBE SO , BUT WE CAN 'T REALLY RULE OUT VISIONS EITHER , CAN WE ? YEAH , BUT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT PRISON CAMPS . MAIA HASN 'T BROKEN ANY LAWS . SHE IS A 4400 . SHE DIDN 'T TAKE PROMICIN . I 'M AFRAID THAT DISTINCTION DOESN 'T MEAN MUCH THESE DAYS . PEOPLE ARE SCARED . A LOT OF THEM WANT TO LOCK UP EVERY P-POSITIVE OUT THERE . THE WRONG LEADER COMES TO POWER , SOMEONE WHO EXPLOITS ALL THAT FEAR EVERYBODY 'S FEELING , AND SUDDENLY THIS DOESN 'T SEEM SO FARFETCHED . THERE 'S A MORE PRODUCTIVE WAY TO LOOK AT THIS . I MEAN , IF THEY ARE VISIONS , AT LEAST WE 'VE GOT SOME WARNING . YOU KNOW , IF WE HAD MORE SPECIFICS , MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SURE THEY DON 'T COME TRUE . I 'M TRYING TO STOP MY DAUGHTER FROM HAVING THESE NIGHTMARES , NOT ENCOURAGE HER TO HAVE MORE SPECIFIC ONES SO THAT YOU CAN ANALYZE THEM . THANKS FOR YOUR HELP , THOUGH . EXCUSE ME ? SORRY , I DIDN 'T SEE YOU THERE . CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING ? YEAH , LOOK , I 'M ON MY WAY OUT OF TOWN . ANY CHANCE I CAN FILL UP ? YOUR PUMPS DON 'T SEEM TO BE WORKING . I HAVEN 'T HAD A GAS TRUCK AROUND IN A WHILE , BUT I THINK I GOT A SPARE GAS CAN IN THE BACK . JUST GIVE ME A SEC ? YEAH . WHAT ARE YOU DOING , MISTER ? THAT 'S MY SON 'S CAR . WHERE IS HE ? CALM DOWN , I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . WHERE 'S KYLE ? I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT , MAN ! NOW , YOU HOLD IT RIGHT THERE . TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THAT MAN RIGHT NOW . SHERIFF , THIS MAN HAS MY SON 'S CAR . TELL HIM . TELL HIM ! I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT ! HE 'S BEEN MESSING WITH THIS VEHICLE FOR MONTHS . YOU SAID YOURSELF YOUR BOY JUST DROVE THROUGH HERE TODAY . THAT 'S MY SON 'S CAR , I KNOW IT IS . NOW , LOOK , I AM SORRY FOR YOUR TROUBLES , MISTER , BUT YOU 'RE WRONG , AND I DON 'T THINK WE CAN HELP YOU HERE , SO MAYBE IT 'S TIME YOU JUST MOVED ON , HUH ? STARTER 'S ON THE FRITZ . GIVE ME A HAND HERE ? YOU SHOULDN 'T HAVE SEEN THAT , MISTER . WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE ? WHAT IS THIS PLACE ? YOU SAY YOU DECIPHERED THIS ? ISABELLE DID . IT 'S A LIST OF NAMES , BUT IT 'S PEOPLE WHO ARE ALIVE TODAY . POLITICIANS , RELIGIOUS LEADERS , SCIENTISTS . THE BOOK SAYS THAT ONCE THESE PEOPLE ALL TAKE PROMICIN , EVERYONE WILL . IT 'S LIKE A DOMINO EFFECT . AND THAT 'S WHEN GOD COMES ? I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY , BUT ... ONLY IF YOU TAKE THE BOOK LITERALLY . I MEAN , " GOD " COULD MEAN ... ANY NUMBER OF THINGS . IF THESE PEOPLE SAW A WORLD HEALED BY PROMICIN , THEY COULD HAVE INTERPRETED THAT AS HEAVEN . I DON 'T KNOW . I MEAN , THE ONLY WAY WE 'LL KNOW IS IF WE JUST FOLLOW THE BOOK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS , RIGHT ? WE 'VE ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO CHARACTERIZE THE MOVEMENT AS A REVOLUTION . REVOLUTIONS DIVIDE , DESTABILIZE , SPREAD FEAR . RELIGIONS ... RELIGIONS UNITE . APPARENTLY THERE 'S AN NTAC AGENT IN TOWN LOOKING FOR HIS SON . MY DAD KNOWS I TOOK THE SHOT . HE MUST HAVE TRACKED ME HERE . HE WOULD HAVE COME ON HIS OWN . HE 'S JUST LOOKING TO PROTECT ME , THAT 'S IT . JORDAN , BE CAREFUL WITH HIM , OKAY ? HE 'S MY FATHER , AND ... HE 'S THE LAST NAME ON THE LIST . THE BOOK SAYS YOUR FATHER HAS TO TAKE THE SHOT ? YEAH . INTERESTING . SO , THE APPLICATION FOR THE HEALING FOUNDATION IS BLIND . HELPS TO AVOID FAVORITISM , AND WE AVERAGE ABOUT A DOZEN TREATMENTS A DAY NOW . WELL , THE WORK YOU DO HERE IS ... REMARKABLE . BUT THEN I ALREADY KNEW THAT . WELL , DOES THAT MEAN YOU 'RE GOING TO STOP SLINGING MUD AT ME ? QUITE THE CONTRARY . I INTEND ON ATTACKING YOU RIGHT UP UNTIL THE DAY OF THE ELECTION . YOU SEEM TO BE TAKING THIS AS IF IT 'S A REFERENDUM ON YOUR CHARACTER . I ASSURE YOU THAT IT ISN 'T . PERSONALLY , I THINK YOU 'RE AN EXCEPTIONAL YOUNG MAN , BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU REPRESENT , SO GOING AFTER YOU , WELL , THAT 'S JUST GOOD POLITICS . SO YOU DON 'T THINK I 'M A THREAT , BUT YOU 'RE GOING TO SAY THAT I AM ANYWAY ? YOU , UM ... YOU LOOK SO SHOCKED . LOOK , I HAVE MY EYE ON SOMETHING GREATER THAN JUST CITY COUNCIL . WHEN YOU DECLARED FOR THE RACE , YOU BROUGHT THE NATIONAL MEDIA SPOTLIGHT WITH YOU , AND IF I DIDN 'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT , WELL ... I WOULDN 'T BE MUCH OF A POLITICIAN , NOW , WOULD I ? DON 'T MAKE A SOUND . NOW OPEN THE DOOR . OPEN IT UP . WHATEVER YOU CAN DO , WHATEVER YOUR ABILITY IS , DON 'T TRY TO USE IT . I CAN 'T HURT ANYBODY . PLEASE , PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW . WHAT IS THIS PLACE ? WHAT DID YOU PEOPLE DO TO THIS TOWN ? IT WAS AN OLD TIMBER MILL TOWN . IT WAS ABANDONED YEARS AGO , SO WE CAME AND MADE IT OUR OWN . WHO 'S WE ? ALL OF US . EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE HAS TAKEN THE SHOT . WE JUST WANTED A PLACE WHERE WE COULD LIVE PEACEFULLY WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING ARRESTED . THAT WON 'T WORK HERE . WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN DISRUPT ELECTRICAL SIGNALS . WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY SON ? NOTHING . HE CAME TO US . HE 'S SAFE . HE 'S BEING TAKEN CARE OF . THEN TAKE ME TO HIM . NOW . NO , I WOULDN 'T SAY THAT MY MEETING WITH MR. FARRELL DID ANYTHING TO CONVINCE ME THAT A 4400 SHOULD HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE . MAIA , WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP ? I 'M NOT TIRED . IS THAT TRUE , OR ARE YOU JUST WORRIED ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT DREAM ? SWEETIE , IT 'S OKAY TO BE SCARED . YOU KNOW , YOU 'RE UPSET , AND WE 'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES . WHY ARE WE BACK HERE ? WHY DO I HAVE TO FIND A NEW SCHOOL ? AND WHY IS BEN GONE ? WELL , SWEETIE- - AND WHY DO YOU ALWAYS CALL ME SWEETIE WHEN I GET UPSET ? I 'M NOT A LITTLE KID ANYMORE . NO , OKAY , MAIA , YOU 'RE RIGHT . YOU 'RE NOT A LITTLE KID , AND I UNDERSTAND IF YOU 'RE MAD AT ME . I MEAN , WE 'VE MOVED AROUND A LOT , BUT THIS CITY , AS SCARY AS IT CAN BE , IS THE ONE PLACE WHERE YOUR MOM CAN DO THE MOST GOOD , AND THAT 'S IMPORTANT . I TRIED TO PRETEND THAT IT WASN 'T , AND I HOPE YOU 'LL APPRECIATE THAT ONE DAY . BUT , SWEETIE ... MAIA , YOU CAN 'T STAY UP FOREVER . IT 'LL ONLY MAKE YOU FEEL WORSE . DO YOU THINK I COULD HAVE THAT CAN ? [ WHISPERING ] : KYLE ... KYLE ? [ WHISPERING ] : HERE . HEY , KYLE , YOU ALL RIGHT ? I 'M FINE , THANKS , BUT I 'M NOT KYLE . COLLIER , GET DOWN ON THE GROUND ! HELLO , TOM . THAT BACON SMELLS GOOD , HUH ? OKAY , SO TO MAKE SCRAMBLED EGGS ... DO YOU WANT TO CRACK THE EGG ? OH , I HOPE WE DIDN 'T WAKE YOU . WE FIGURED YOU WOULD WANT TO SLEEP AFTER LAST NIGHT . HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS ? MORNING , TOM . WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME ? WELL , WE 'VE TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THAT YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF WHILE YOU 'RE OUR GUEST . THAT BRACELET YOU 'RE WEARING , OUR TOWN MECHANIC CREATED THAT . DALTON . I BELIEVE YOU MET HIM . IT 'S QUITE A DEVICE . IT ALLOWS US TO TRACK YOU WHEREVER YOU GO . AND THAT ... THAT PAIN IN YOUR HEAD , HE DID THAT . HE 'S CAPABLE OF WORSE . SO , IF YOU BECOME VIOLENT WHILE YOU 'RE HERE , OR MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO LEAVE EVANSTON- - WHERE 'S KYLE ? KYLE IS FINE . WE 'VE BEEN TALKING . HE 'S A VERY BRAVE YOUNG MAN . WHERE IS HE ? I WANT TO SEE HIM . NOT YET . KYLE AND I AGREE , YOU 'RE NOT READY . YOU DON 'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE 'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE . ALL RIGHT , THEN TELL ME , WHAT IS THIS PLACE ? IT 'S A MODEL FOR A BETTER WORLD . I GATHERED THESE PEOPLE . THEY ALL TOOK THE SHOT AND LEFT THEIR OLD LIVES BEHIND . THEY 'VE CREATED SOMETHING BETTER HERE IN EVANSTON . HAVE A WALK AROUND . SEE FOR YOURSELF . MAIA 'S DREAMING ABOUT GABRIEL HEWITT ? IN HER NIGHTMARES , HE 'S SOME KIND OF LEADER . PRESIDENT , VICE PRESIDENT , CABINET MEMBER , I DON 'T KNOW , BUT HE SEEMS TO BE OVERSEEING SOME EXTREMELY REPRESSIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE 4400 . LOOK , NOBODY RESPECTS YOUR DAUGHTER 'S ABILITY MORE THAN I DO , AND I 'M SORRY THAT SHE 'S SEEING THESE THINGS , BUT HEWITT , HE 'S ON THE SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL . THAT 'S A LONG WAY AWAY FROM PULLING THESE KINDS OF STRINGS . NO , PLEASE UNDERSTAND , I THINK YOU 'VE TAKEN A VERY BRAVE STEP BY DECLARING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE . I MEAN , IT 'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF GESTURE THIS COUNTRY NEEDS , BUT , I MEAN , YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT YOU MAY INADVERTENTLY BE GIVING A PLATFORM TO A VERY DANGEROUS MAN . WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME TO DO ? DROP OUT ? BECAUSE THAT 'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN . I 'M NOT ASKING YOU TO DO ANYTHING . I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE THE FACTS . BUT THESE AREN 'T FACTS , THEY 'RE DREAMS . SHAWN ... EVEN IF THEY ARE VISIONS , I STOP THEM FROM HAPPENING BY STAYING IN THE RACE , BY TAKING A STAND AGAINST HATRED AND PROVING HEWITT WRONG . I HOPE THAT 'S WHAT HAPPENS , BUT RIGHT NOW ... THAT 'S NOT WHAT MAIA 'S SEEING . WE 'RE NOT THE ENEMY , YOU KNOW . WE JUST THINK PEOPLE DESERVE A CHOICE . I WAS IN A ... BAD PLACE WHEN I TOOK THE SHOT . MOST OF US WERE . BUT NOW I CAN DO SOMETHING WONDERFUL , SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE CAN . WHAT IS IT ? YOUR ABILITY ? I GUESS YOU COULD CALL ME AN ANXIETY EXTRACTOR ? I TALK TO PEOPLE . ACTUALLY , THEY DO MOST OF THE TALKING , BUT WHEN WE 'RE DONE , THEY FEEL BETTER . ALL THEIR WORRY 'S JUST GONE . WHAT 'S THAT , LIKE A SOUPED-UP SHRINK ? I DON 'T HAVE ANY ADVICE , BELIEVE ME , BUT ... IT WORKS . I TALKED TO JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY IN TOWN . WOULD YOU WANT TO TRY IT ? I DON 'T THINK SO . THINK OF IT AS A GOOD FAITH GESTURE . YOU 'D BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO SEEING YOUR SON . PLUS , NO OFFENSE ... BUT I THINK YOU COULD USE IT . KYLE SAYS YOU 'RE ESSENTIAL TO WHAT I 'M DOING . HE 'S A VERY FORGIVING YOUNG MAN . HE WASN 'T THERE WHEN YOU KILLED 4400s . WHY SHOULDN 'T I BE RID OF YOU FOREVER ? I DON 'T KNOW . I 'M NOT IN THAT BOOK , BUT WHEN I FIRST GOT OLDER , I WAS TOLD I EXISTED TO STOP THE 4400 , AND THAT 'S WHAT I TRIED TO DO . YOU BEAT ME . I THOUGHT I 'D SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE IN PRISON , THINKING ABOUT WHAT I 'D DONE , AND THEN KYLE FOUND ME . HE TOLD ME I HAVE A PURPOSE . HE TOLD ME I COULD STILL BE GOOD . YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I WANT THAT TO BE TRUE . SO IF HELPING YOU IS THE WAY TO MAKE MY LIFE MEAN SOMETHING , I WANT TO TRY . IF I ACCEPT WHAT KYLE SAYS ABOUT OUR MOVEMENT , I HAVE TO ACCEPT WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT YOU , BUT THE FIRST MOMENT YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS , YOUR INVITATION IS RESCINDED , AND YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THAT MEANS . CUT HER DOWN . EVERY MOVE I MAKE , IT SEEMS LIKE THERE 'S SOME KIND OF LOSS THAT COMES WITH IT , AND THE WOMAN I LOVE IS GONE , I 'M LOSING MY SON TO COLLIER , AND I ... ARE YOU DONE ? HOW DO YOU FEEL ? WOW , I ACTUALLY FEEL BETTER . IT 'S NOT PERMANENT . WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE FOLLOW-UP TALKS . IT ... WHAT IS THIS ? WHENEVER I TALK TO SOMEONE , AT THE END , THERE 'S ONE OF THESE . I THINK IT REPRESENTS ALL OF THE BAD STUFF INSIDE OF YOU . THE FEAR , ANXIETY ... YOU SHOULD KEEP IT . A LITTLE REMINDER OF WHAT WE DO HERE . KATHY , YOU WEREN 'T LYING . THIS PIE IS DELICIOUS . YEAH , THE PIE 'S PRETTY GOOD , BUT THE AFTERTASTE IS A KILLER . AFTERTASTE ? WHAT AFTERTASTE ? YOU 'LL SEE . HE 'S GETTING SCARED . SHANNON , TELL HIM IT 'S OKAY . IT 'S ALL RIGHT , TOM . JUST RELAX . THE PIE HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING IN IT . WHOA , WHOA , WHOA , WHOA , WHOA , WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOMETHING ? WHAT SOMETHING ? WHAT SOMETHING ? IT 'S A SPECIAL INGREDIENT , COURTESY OF ONE OF OUR RESIDENTS . AFTER WE TAKE IT , WE SHARE ONE MIND . WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER 'S MEMORIES . IT 'S HOW WE KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER . IT 'S AMAZING , IF YOU JUST RELAX . THIS WAS BILLY 'S LAST BIRTHDAY , BEFORE HIS PARENTS WERE KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH . THAT 'S PAUL AND KATHY . THEY WERE SO CUTE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG . HE POPPED THE QUESTION AFTER THREE WEEKS . HE SAID HE JUST KNEW . THEY CAN 'T SEE US ? WE 'RE NOT EVEN REALLY HERE . IT 'S JUST A MEMORY . I 'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE . THIS IS ME . OH , MY GOD , THAT 'S ME . WE WON THE LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP THAT YEAR . MY FATHER ACTUALLY CAME TO THE GAME . HEY ... I , UH ... I DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY . ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER . THAT WAS AMAZING . YOU KNOW , I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU ALL NOW . IT 'S PRETTY INTENSE , ISN 'T IT ? I 'M JUST GLAD YOU FINALLY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION . YEAH , ME TOO . HEY DAD I 'M GLAD YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THIS PLACE . THESE PEOPLE , THEY 'RE NOT EVIL . THEY 'RE JUST LOOKING TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES , AND THEY DID . HOW COULD YOU TAKE THE SHOT ? HOW COULD YOU RISK YOUR LIFE LIKE THAT ? IT WAS WORTH IT , DAD . IT BROUGHT ME HERE . IN A WEIRD WAY , IT BROUGHT US TOGETHER . I KNOW OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN COMPLICATED , BUT THIS PLACE IS SIMPLE . IT 'S GOOD , DAD . AND THE LIFE THEY 'RE LIVING HERE , DAD , THAT COULD BE OUR LIFE . WE COULD LIVE HERE , YOU AND ME . ISN 'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT ? FOR US TO BE TOGETHER ? OF COURSE . MORE THAN ANYTHING . IF YOU WANT TO STAY HERE , IF YOU WANT TO LIVE HERE WITH ME ... YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE SHOT . KYLE , YOU KNOW I CAN 'T DO THAT . ARE YOU AFRAID OF DYING , DAD ? BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU , IF YOU TAKE THE SHOT , YOU WILL LIVE . HOW COULD YOU KNOW THAT ? EVERYBODY HERE HAS AN ABILITY . SO DO I. I CAN 'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW , BUT I KNOW THAT YOU 'LL BE OKAY . I KNOW THAT 'S A LOT TO TAKE IN RIGHT NOW . YOU DON 'T HAVE TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER RIGHT AWAY . JUST SLEEP ON IT . I KNOW I HAVEN 'T SAID THIS TO YOU IN A LONG TIME , BUT I LOVE YOU . [ COLLIER ] : DO YOU THINK HE 'LL DO IT ? PART OF HIM WANTS TO . I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES . HE KNOWS THIS PLACE IS GOOD , BUT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAS JUST BEEN ABOUT DUTY . THE FBI , NTAC . I 'M NOT SURE HE 'LL BE ABLE TO JUST TURN HIS BACK ON ALL THAT . AND IF HE SAYS NO ? HIS NAME 'S IN THE BOOK , RIGHT ? THAT 'S PRETTY MUCH A GUARANTEE THAT HE CAN SURVIVE THE SHOT . CAN WE JUST MAKE HIM TAKE IT ? I 'VE NEVER FORCED ANYONE TO TAKE PROMICIN . THE MOVEMENT 'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT CHOICE . BUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FATHER , IT 'S INTRICATE ... SO IF YOU THINK IT BEST TO GIVE HIM THE SHOT , I 'LL RESPECT YOUR DECISION . SO IF I STAY IN THE RACE , I 'M CREATING A MONSTER . YOU DON 'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE . REMEMBER , WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT DREAMS . NO , THESE AREN 'T JUST DREAMS . THIS GIRL PREDICTED THAT JORDAN WOULD BE SHOT . SHE CAN TELL THE FUTURE , AND HEWITT SAID IT HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS HERE . HE 'S USING ME TO GET ATTENTION FOR HIS CAREER . I CAN 'T JUST SIT ON THIS . I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING . IF JORDAN FOUND OUT THAT SOME GUY WAS RISING TO POWER ON HIS BACK , AND HE COULD BECOME SOME KIND OF ... HOME-GROWN HITLER , HE WOULDN 'T JUST SIT AROUND WRINGING HIS HANDS . HE 'D ACT . GOOD MORNING , TOM . YOU 'RE DONATING PROMICIN ? EVERY WEEK . WE ALL DO . I HATE NEEDLES , BUT JORDAN 'S GIVEN US ALL SO MUCH . WE FIGURE THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS GIVE SOMETHING BACK . I RIGGED UP THIS MACHINE HERE . YOU WANT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS ? NO . I 'M GLAD I SAW THIS PLACE . I KNOW HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO YOU , AND FOR THE FIRST TIME , I FEEL LIKE MAYBE I UNDERSTAND WHAT COLLIER 'S TRYING TO DO . YEAH . BUT I CAN 'T BE A PART OF IT . YOU 'RE JUST HOLDING ONTO THIS IDEA OF YOURSELF AS OUR OPPONENT , OUR ENEMY . YOU CAN JUST LET GO OF THAT . IT 'D BE SO EASY . IT 'S NOT ABOUT THAT , KYLE . THIS TOWN , IT 'S LIKE A LITTLE UTOPIA , BUT IT EXISTS TO SEND PROMICIN OUT INTO THE STREETS , AND NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT , HALF THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THAT SHOT ARE GOING TO DIE , AND I CAN 'T LIVE WITH THAT . YOU HAVE TO . WE ALL HAVE TO , DAD . FORGET 50-50 , OKAY ? IF THE MOVEMENT DOESN 'T SUCCEED , NOBODY HAS ANY CHANCE . I DON 'T BELIEVE THAT . I CAN 'T . I GET IT . YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE , AND SO DO I. NO , WAIT , KYLE . YOU ARE THE ONLY THING THAT COULD TEMPT ME TO DO THIS . I LOVE YOU . GET OUT OF MY WAY . I 'M LEAVING . I 'M SORRY YOU 'VE DECLINED OUR INVITATION , TOM . I 'M SORRY YOUR LACK OF FAITH WILL COST YOU YOUR SON . I 'M WALKING AWAY . YOU GO AHEAD AND GIVE ME A STROKE IF YOU HAVE TO , BUT I 'M WALKING OUT OF THIS TOWN . YOU KNOW I CAN 'T LET YOU DO THAT . NO . NO ... NO ! I TOLD YOU . I 'M NOT TAKING THE SHOT ! NO ! KYLE ! NO ... NO ! NO ! NO ! AH ! NO ! NO ! NO ! NO ... KYLE ! KYLE ! KYLE ! IT 'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE POLITICS , IS IT ? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE ? EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID TO ME IN MY OFFICE THAT DAY WAS A LIE . THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY . YOU KNOW THAT I COULD HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING . THE TRUTH IS YOU HATE US ALL . YOU HATE ALL THE 4400 . SO WHAT IF I DO ? I MEAN , WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ? NOW , I 'LL ASK YOU AGAIN , WHY ARE YOU HANGING AROUND OUTSIDE MY GARAGE ? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? I WANTED TO SEE YOU WITHOUT THE CAMERAS WHEN YOU PUT YOUR PUBLIC FACE UP FOR THE NIGHT , HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR EYES . I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU 'RE CAPABLE OF TERRIBLE THINGS , AND THAT YOU HAVE AN EVIL LIVING INSIDE OF YOU . WHAT IF YOU DID SEE EVIL ? THEN WHAT ? HONESTLY , I DON 'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO , BUT THE TRUTH IS , I CAN 'T SEE ANYTHING . YOU MAY BE FULL OF FEAR AND HATRED , BUT YOU 'RE JUST A MAN . FOR NOW . LISTEN , YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IT YET . YOU WOULDN 'T MAKE A VERY GOOD LEADER . I 'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU BECOME ONE . BUT YOUR PROMICIN TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE . YEAH . I 'M SO SORRY ABOUT KYLE , TOM . WE NEED TO CALL MEGHAN , ISSUE A NEW APB . JORDAN COLLIER , HIS FOLLOWERS ... AND MY SON . I COULDN 'T FORCE HIM TO TAKE IT , JORDAN . I 'M SORRY . WELL , I LEFT THE CHOICE UP TO YOU . ANYWAY , THE SEDATIVE WE GAVE HIM GAVE US ENOUGH TIME TO GET OUT OF EVANSTON . BUT HE 'S GONE . I LOST MY DAD . WE LOST MY DAD . HIS NAME IS IN THE BOOK . IF HE DOESN 'T TAKE THE SHOT , WE DON 'T SUCCEED . THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE FAITH HE WILL . BUT IT WON 'T HAPPEN BECAUSE WE FORCED IT ON HIM . ONE DAY , KYLE , I BELIEVE YOUR FATHER WILL COME TO US . WE LOST EVANSTON BECAUSE OF ME . I COST US PARADISE . IT 'S ALL RIGHT . EVANSTON WAS NEVER MEANT AS A PERMANENT SETTLEMENT . IT WAS ONLY A ... A DRESS REHEARSAL FOR PARADISE . SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW ? YOU 'VE GOT ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE . WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THEM ? ... ......... ? / ... ........ ? ... .......... ? ... ........ ? ... ....... ?

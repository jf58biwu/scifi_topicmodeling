THE OLD GWEN WOULD HAVE BEEN UP THERE TO SEE NIKKI BEVAN IN A FLASH . YOU 'RE ONE OF THEM NOW , AREN 'T YOU ? TOO BUSY TO BOTHER WITH ONE MISSING CHILD . WHAT IS IT , NOT MAJOR ENOUGH FOR YOU ? NOT SPOOKY ENOUGH ? SORRY TO BOTHER YOU . NIKKI BEVAN ? GWEN COOPER . I 'M WORKING WITH THE POLICE ON JONAH 'S DISAPPEARANCE . ANDY SAID YOU MIGHT BE ROUND . OH , HE DID , DID HE ? RECKONS YOU 'VE GOT A DIFFERENT AREA OF EXPERTISE . WHAT IS IT , FORENSICS ? I 'M JUST A FRESH EYE . SORRY ABOUT THE MESS . WOW , FILM FAN , ARE YOU ? CROWDS . SORRY ? IT 'S ALL CROWD FOOTAGE . EVER SINCE HE WENT . FOOTBALL MATCHES , CONCERTS , FESTIVALS ... ANYWHERE THERE 'S A CROWD , I RECORD IT . GO THROUGH IT , FRAME BY FRAME , CHECKING EVERY FACE . SOMETIMES I THINK IT 'S HIM , BUT THE PICTURE 'S SO GRAINY , I SPEND HOURS LOOKING AT ONE CORNER OF THE SCREEN . BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY , I CHECK AGAIN AND IT 'S NOT . IT 'S THE HOPE THAT 'S KILLING ME . EVEN IF YOU SAW HIM , WHAT WOULD YOU DO ? FIND SOMEONE THAT WAS WITH HIM . IF I COULD JUST LET HIM KNOW I SAW HIM . HE 'S GOTTA BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE . DO YOU THINK I 'M MAD ? NO , I THINK YOU 'D MAKE A GREAT POLICEWOMAN . HIS ROOM 'S AS HE LEFT IT ? I SLEEP IN HERE SOME NIGHTS . BURY MY HEAD IN THE PILLOW . IT STILL SMELLS OF HIM . EXCEPT , THE MORE I DO IT , THE MORE IT SMELLS LIKE ME . I KEEP HIS DIARY FOR HIM . I SIT IN HERE AND IMAGINE I 'M HIM . WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID WRONG ? SORRY ? SHE SIGHS MAYBE I WAS TOO NOSEY ... OR NOT INTERESTED ENOUGH . MAYBE HE FELT UNLOVED . ALL I 'VE GOT IS QUESTIONS . WHAT ABOUT JONAH 'S DAD ? WE WERE ONLY TOGETHER ABOUT SIX WEEKS . I THOUGHT WHEN HE FIRST WENT MISSING AND WAS ON THE TELLY , HIS DAD MIGHT GET IN TOUCH . BUT NO , STILL MANAGES TO DISAPPOINT . OH , HANG ON . ANDY TRIED TO FIND ME A SUPPORT GROUP , BUT THERE WEREN 'T ANY . SO I THOUGHT I 'D SET ONE UP MYSELF . IT 'S OUR FIRST MEETING . WILL YOU COME ? OH , I DUNNO . ANDY 'LL BE THERE .

HEY , WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ? IT 'S BARELY A BLIP ON THE SYSTEM . SO INSIGNIFICANT , I 'VE BEEN IGNORING IT . BUT WHEN I LOOKED CLOSER ... THIS IS WHAT WE RECOGNISE AS STANDARD RIFT ACTIVITY . BUT WHAT I 'VE DISCOVERED IS A NEGATIVE RIFT SPIKE THAT OCCURRED AT THE TIME YOU 'RE QUERYING . NOW , WE 'VE ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT THESE READINGS WERE RESIDUAL RIFT FLARES . LIKE AN AFTERSHOCK . BUT , BECAUSE THIS ONE COINCIDED WITH JONAH 'S DISAPPEARANCE , I THINK WE 'VE BEEN MISINTERPRETING . OK , SO ? SO , WE 'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THINGS CAN ONLY COME THROUGH THE RIFT ONE WAY . WHAT IF WE 'RE WRONG ? WHAT IF THE RIFT DOESN 'T JUST LEAVE STUFF BEHIND ? WHAT IF IT ALSO TAKES ? WHO ELSE HAVE YOU TOLD ABOUT THIS ? NO-ONE . I CALLED YOU AS SOON AS I REALISED . IT COULD BE A COINCIDENCE , OR AN ANOMALY . I CAN 'T BE SURE UNLESS I CAN CROSS-REFERENCE IT WITH OTHER EXAMPLES . CAN WE KEEP THIS TO OURSELVES ? THERE 'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO .

PEOPLE DO GO MISSING FOR OTHER REASONS . NO . TOSHIKO CROSS-REFERENCED THE LOCATIONS WITH THE RIFT SPIKES . THOSE WE IDENTIFIED ARE DEFINITELY VICTIMS OF THE RIFT . WHAT DO WE THINK HAPPENS TO THEM ? SCATTERED THROUGH TIME AND SPACE , I GUESS . CHEERY THOUGHT , THANK YOU . THIS IS GOOD WORK . BUT I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO . FIND A WAY TO PREVENT IT . TOSHIKO , CAN WE PREDICT WHEN THE SPIKES ARE GONNA HAPPEN ? NO . AND THEY 'RE GONE IN A MATTER OF SECONDS . THEN I DON 'T KNOW HOW WE COMBAT THEM . JACK , WE HAVE A DUTY HERE . THESE PEOPLE ARE VICTIMS OF THE RIFT . IF THEY 'RE ATTACKED BY A WEEVIL ... WE CAN CATCH THEM . IF THEY 'RE VICTIMS , WE FIX THEIR WOUNDS , BUT THIS , WE DON 'T KNOW WHEN IT 'S GONNA HAPPEN , WE DON 'T KNOW WHERE THEY END UP . SERIOUSLY , GWEN . HM ? PRACTICALLY , TELL ME WHAT WE SHOULD DO .

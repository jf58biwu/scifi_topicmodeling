 'Scuse me , have you seen a blowfish driving a sports car ? Thank you ! Bloody Torchwood ! Species not on record , DNA-type says some sort of land fish . All I 'm saying is , you are speeding and there are children . Kids out at midnight , they 've got it coming . Detecting high levels of algae . Who 's afraid of the big scary fish ? Big fish with a gun . - Special weapons ? - Not that I can see . Do we need special weapons ? What are we gonna do when we catch it ? - Jack would know . - Well , ] ack 's not here , is he ? ] ack 's disappeared ! Fat lot of good jack is ! Blowfish ! Hold on ! - Hold the wheel . - Don 't you dare , Owen ! Hold the wheel ! Right , got it . Where is it , where 's it gone ? Go ! Go ! Go ! Gwen , go left , Tosh go right , Ianto take centre . Positions ! Massive levels of adrenalin . Mixed with approximately three grams of cocaine . This fish is wired . So , this is Team Torchwood . The teacher 's pets . But teacher 's gone , hasn 't he ? Leaving the kiddy-kids all alone . And look at you , trying so hard to be all grown up . The Doctor , with his hands full of blood . The CMM , with her oh-so-beating heart . The Technician , with her cold devices . Which leaves me , with the Office Boy , promoted beyond his measure . All of you , lost without your master . All of you , pretending to be so brave . All of you , so scared . Ha ha ha ! So , what about it , minion ? Can you do it ? How good are you ? How sharp is your aim ? What if you kill her ? What if I kill her first ? Can you shoot , before I do ? Can you ? Dare you ? Would you ? Won 't you ? Hey kids . Did you miss me ? + + + + + + + + + Are you sure no more like him came through ? Cross-referencing with the rift activity monitor , doesn 't look like it . The car 's impounded , I 'll get it back to the owner in the morning . - How you doing ? - Bio-profile 's on screen . Nothing in his genetic make-up to contaminate the city . Ok , Tosh , can you add that to the species database ? - Ianto ? - Hello ! Sorry , can you deal with the body when it 's cold ? My pleasure and I 'll make sushi . No , the morgue and I 'll do fine , thank you . Got pretty organised without me . Yeah , well we had to . I Did you decorate in here ? You left us , Jack ! - I know . I 'm sorry . - We knew nothing , Jack . Where were you ? I found my Doctor . - Did he fix you ? - What 's to fix ? You don 't mess with this level of perfection ! Are you going back to him ? I came back for you . All of you . Rift activity ! Get off , I didn 't do it . Please , leave me alone . Duh ... Help me ! Come any closer and I 'll open up his neck ! - Fine ! - What ? ! Which artery do you normally sever ? - No . - I 'm not bluffing ! Well , see now you 've given yourself away . Only someone who 's bluffing ever says they 're not . Oh , God ! Shit ! Please , please stop ! Well ... No . He 's dead . Please ... I ... was never here . Go . Thirsty now . All right ! Now ... You ... go . You go . You go . You stay . Go . Go . Go . Stay . Go . Go . Go . Go . Go . Oh ... Stay , stay , stay . Go . Go . Go . Go . Go . The rest of you , go . I 'll take one of everything . Any questions ? All right , mate , let 's take it outside . Oh . Did I mention I 'm armed ? Ha ha ha ha ha ! Fragments of rift energy , around the neck , arm and shoulders . He was grabbed ... and pushed . Explains the residual energy cluster How did you ever manage without me ? So , there 's a killer on the loose . Bipedal , maybe humanoid . Any other alien tech involved , Tosh ? No readings to suggest that . Ok , let 's get back and see what we can piece together . Technology gain you ? I was hoping for a power struggle , resolved by some naked wrestling . Thank you , Andy . You can let SOCO in now , they can eliminate us from whatever they want . This another one of your spooky-dos ? Not yet , but I 'll let you know . " Thanks , Andy . You 've been very helpful . " Don 't mention it , Gwen . Whoa , that never beeps . That 's what I was thinking . I can 't believe I got the answer machine ! What can you be doing that 's more important than me ? Anyway , you 've probably traced the energy shift , found the body . All me , sorry about the mess . Bill me for the clean-up . Now , drinks ! Retrolock the transmission coordinates , that 's where I am . And hurry up , work to do ! Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi , you 're my only hope ! Stay here . Don 't come after me . - Who was that ? - Stay here . Hey , Jack ! Wait ! See that ! He swans back in and then he shuts us right out . - I 'm not having this . - I can track him . Taxi ! [ " Song 2 " by Blur ] # Woo hoo # When I feel heavy metal # Woo hoo # And I 'm pins and I 'm needles # Woo hoo # Well , I lie and I 'm easy # All of the time I am never sure # Why I need you ... # Reports of a bar disturbance , same coordinates as the SUV . Tell the police we 're dealing with it . Ok , so , who the hell was the bloke in the hologram ? Jack recognised him . Why didn 't he let us go with him ? It 's typical Jack , he disappears , he comes back , then he runs away again . We don 't even know his real name . Or which time he comes from . He 's supposed to be our boss , we know nothing about him . It drives me crazy ! It is more fun when he 's around , though . - Yeah . - Definitely ! Yeah , it is ! - You 're putting on weight ? - You 're losing your hair ? What are you wearing ? Captain Jack Harkness , note the stripes . Captain John Hart , note the sarcasm . I worked my way up through the ranks . I bet the ranks were very grateful . I need a drink . I thought you 'd never ask . So , how was rehab ? Rehabs . Plural . - Drink , drugs , sex and ... - Murder . Ha ha ! You went to murder rehab ? I know , ridiculous . The odd kill , who does it hurt ? You clean now ? Kicked everything . Living like a priest . So , how 's the Time Agency ? You didn 't hear ? Shut down . You 're kidding . No . There 's only seven of us left now . Wow . It 's good to see you . It was never the same without you . You need to go . I don 't want you on my territory . What ? Time was , you couldn 't get enough of me on your " territory " . All right , everybody out ! Everything all right , Jack ? It 's ok , ok , ok . You 've got a team ! How sweet ! Oh , pretty little friends ! No blonde , though . You need a blonde . - God , he 's worse than Jack . - Oh , do you have a team name ? I love team names , go on ! Torchwood . Oh . Not Excalibur ? Blizzard ? Bikini Cops ? No ? Torchwood . Oh , dear . Gwen Cooper , Ianto Jones , Toshiko Sato , Owen Harper , - meet ... - Captain John Hart . - We go back . - Excuse me . We more than go back . We were partners . - In what way ? - In every way . And then some . It was two weeks . Except that two weeks was trapped in a time loop , so we were together for five years , it was like having a wife . - You were the wife . - YOU were the wife . - No , YOU were the wife . - Oh , but I was a good wife . I bet you were . What ? Don 't pretend you haven 't noticed , he 's cute . They 're just shy . What are you doing here ? I was wondering when I we 'd get to that . - That 's the same as yours . - A little smaller . But lasts much longer . Get two Time Agents in the same room together , it 's always about the size of the wrist strap . Yes , sorry , what 's a Time Agent ? What , he 's never told you about his past ? No , he hasn 't . Anyway ... I 'm working with this woman , beautiful , clever , sexy , yadda yadda yadda , and we both get shot . And as she 's dying , she begs me . She tells me about these radiation cluster bombs she 'd been working on . I don 't like the sound of that . Three canisters , contents beyond toxic , swallowed up in a riftstorm . - And ended up here . - Bingo . That 's the downside of your city being built on a rift in space and time . Now , left to their own devices , the radiation will break down the canisters and then infect your people and planet . They need to be neutralised . What do you get out of this ? Dying woman 's wish . Now , there 's only one problem . I don 't know where they are . I Hoping local knowledge might help . When we get back to the Hub , I can run a citywide scan on radiation surges and cross reference that with the rift activity during that time span . What are you , the brains and the beauty ? You see , together it 's an easy job . We do this , you get of here when its finished . Right away . Does this mean I get to see your house ? You live in a sculpture ? Could you be any more pretentious ? Get on . So , your team not allowed in this way ? This is the entrance for tourists . I remember the last time you said that . Where the hell ... It 's roomy , I 'll give you that . Your taste in interior design hasn 't got any better , though . What is this , sewer chic ? Weapons . And the rest . Oh , you know me , I 'm a two-weapon man . One pistol strapped to each leg , laser knife beneath left elbow , 17 small explosive charges in the lining of his coat . I Slipped my mind . He 's a compulsive liar ! Why is he in the building ? There 's a tiny 1 % chance , he 's breaking a habit of a lifetime , and telling the truth . Which means this city is in danger . What did he mean by a Time Agent ? You 've never mentioned it . That was in the past . Oh , here we go again . You know everything about me , Jack . Why d 'you keep shutting me out ? Here and now , that 's what 's important . The work we do , the person I am now . - That 's what I 'm proud of . - Then why did you desert us ? Where did you go ? No , no , come on , where did you go ? Tell me . Talk to me . I have died so many times . Been dragged back into life , like being hauled over broken glass . I saw the end of the world . - How ? - Doesn 't matter now . But after it was all over I knew I belong here . What kept me fighting was the thought of coming home to you . - What 's this ? - TMS . That 's an engagement ring , that is . - You 're getting married ? - Yes . Rhys asked . When you were away . Wow ! Gwen Cooper getting married . Down on one knee ? He tried to , he had a twinge in his back and had to lie on the settee , and he popped the question . - And you said yes . - Well , no-one else will have me . Good for you . - We should get back to work . - Mm-hm . Seven hours ago we logged a minor surge in rift energy , across three locations . Six of us , three locations , simple . Two people per canister . Excuse me , I give the orders . Well , give some , big boy ! John 's right . Sorry , erm , d 'you prefer John , or Captain ? With eyes like yours , call me Vera , I won 't complain . Tosh and Owen , take the north . Ianto and jack go west . Me and Vera 'll take the docks . Excuse me , not to repeat myself . Got a problem with this , Jack ? Not at all . Now , given the canisters are radioactive , don 't open them , eh ? Let 's go , guys . Gwen , I need a word . Oh , can I watch ? He 's gonna give you all the dos and don 'ts . I love it . She 'll be with you in a second . What the hell are you doing ? If I can get him talking , flirt a bit , he might drop his guard . I can find out what he 's really upto . - OK , clever . - Thank you . But dangerous , leave it to me . I led the team while you were away , Jack . I can handle this . He knows you too well , he 'll never tell you the truth . Three rules . One : don 't believe anything he says . Two : always keep him in front of you . And three : under no circumstances let him kiss you . As if I would ! Has he gone to the no-kissing rule yet ? He only invented that because he wants me all to himself . Keep infront . Nothing . Are you sure this is the right spot ? Yeah . But containers get shifted all the time . This could take days . So , that woman , the one with the canister , how did you get to know her again ? We were in love . Oh . I 'm sorry . Did they catch the person who shot her ? Do we have to talk about this ? No , no , of course not . Don 't mind me . - Shouldn 't you be asleep ? - I got it ! Sorry ? Manager at Hanovoods ! The letter was on the mat ! I got the bloody job ! Oh , my God ! Rhys , that is fantastic ! Baby , you 're fantastic too . Yeah , just there ! - Who 's that ? - It 's some ... idiot I work with that 's all . I don 't suppose there 's any chance of me seeing you before breakfast ? It looks like it 's gonna be an all-nighter . So , get yourself to bed . I am so proud of you . I love you . Yeah , well , I love you more . John ? John ? John ! - John ! - Worried you 'd lost me ? Whoa . Little bit jumpy there ? Keep in front of me , OK ? God , you 're so untrusting . But with your boss it 's probably wise . Yeah , I trust him just fine , thank you . Once a conman , always a conman . What do you mean by that ? Look , just don 't rely on him , Gwen . There 's a lot about him you don 't know . Fancy a peek ? Aha ! Is that it ? What are you doing ? ! Get off me ! Celebrating , that 's all . God , the 21st century is so frigid ! What 've you done ? Don 't get up . I mean , you can 't anyway . Paralysing lip gloss . I think it might have even been Jack taught me that trick . Just one problem , if you 're not found in two hours , your major organs will go into shutdown . Thanks . You gonna be OK in here without me ? He won 't stay with you . He and I shared something . No bulbs . No , cos that would only be helpful . Oh , great , how are we gonna find a canister in all this tut ? What are we doing with our lives , Tosh ? I know , we should be out having fun ! Bet you 'd normally be out on the pull , this time of night . Oh , no , bollocks to that , Tosh . Talk about diminishing returns . Not with you . Well , you know , I 've done all that , aren 't I ? Where did it get me ? No , you know , I need ... a proper woman , you know . Someone I 've got something in common with , you know . Got anyone on the horizon ? Like you say , difficult to meet anyone I 've got anything in common with . What with the things we see . You beauty ! Yes ! Job done ! Good work , team ! Where 's Gwen ? Ah ah ah ! Gun on the floor . Or I shoot her . - Jack , where are you ? - I muted the comms system , as soon as we left the palace under the pavement . I love my little wrist strap . Now ... Phones . You touch her again , and I will kill you . OK ? The efficiency of a gun , or the brutality of wood ? Yeah , look , stop toying with me and get on with it . Oh , yeah ! Loving that officy feel ! I always get excited in these places . To me , they 're exotic . Office romances ... photocopying your butt ... or maybe not your butt , although as we 're here ... The rift was active at these coordinates 200 feet above ground . That means this floor ... or the roof . How are you , Ianto ? All the better for having . You back , sir . Can we maybe drop the sir , now ? While I was away , I was thinking ... Maybe we could , when this is all done ... Dinner ? A movie ? Are you asking me out on a date ? Interested ? Well ... As ... long as it 's not in an office . Some fetishes should I be kept to you sir . Looks like we 're gonna have to go through every drawer , bin and plant pot . Right . OK . I 'll do this floor , don 't want you getting overexcited , and you take the roof . You 're good on roofs . Jack ? Why are we helping him ? He 's a reminder of my past . I want him gone . By the way ... - Was that a yes ? - Yes ! Into the lift , eye candy . Your friends are bleeding , and dying . You barely have enough time to save them . Owen ? Gwen ? What am I , a child ? It 's primitive technology , easily blocked , you should be embarrassed . And when you get to the bottom , run . You look like a man who enjoys a challenge , see if you can save them . Come back up here , I 'll shoot on sight . Going down . Going down ! Yes , please . Why are you doing this ? We 're a cosmic joke , eye candy . An accident of chemicals and evolution . The jokes , the sex , just cover the fact that nothing means anything . And the only consolation , is money . So run , Ianto Jones ! Going down . Doors closing . Rear of the Year , 5094 . Still looking good . Cute boy , ringing to warn you about me . Canister . - If you 've harmed them ... - They 're pretty , but stupid . You used to have better taste . Doesn 't look like that from here . Just give it here . Radiation cluster bombs ? Really ? Let 's not get hung up on details . Little embarrassing that you needed help to find them . A little humiliated you fell for the scam . Your dolly birds did all my leg I work . Is that what you wanted ? What I want is for you to come to your senses . Join me , Jack . Back in the old routine . We 'd be emperors . How can you stay tied to one planet when there 's thousands of worlds , sparkling with wonder ? We should be up there , among the stars , claiming them for our own . Just like before . - I can 't . - Why not ? What the hell is there to keep you here ? Come on . The glitter of the galaxy . The mischief we could make . Y 'know , you never really mastered that temptation spiel . It 's not a spiel . It 's fact . Move on . Here I am , in a new life and you 're still churning out the same old tunes . And sorry , but they don 't play as well , now you 're looking a little older . What are they , wrinkles around your eyes ? Laugh lines . Oh , hell of a good joke . It 's you I 'm laughing at . Canister . Whoops . Ha ha ha ! Whoops . I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry . Why didn 't he just kill us ? He got what he wanted . But maybe he just underestimated us . Tosh ! Owen ! Ianto ! Tosh ! We 're over here . - What happened ? - Where 's Gwen ? - Have you heard from Gwen ? - No . Rehab ... didn 't really work . Front door key . Thanks . If she 's in one of these , we 'll never find her , there 's too many ! Just keep looking ! God , I need more painkillers ! I 'll try her phone again . Over here ! - She must 've dropped it . - Gwen ! Gwen ! Unless it 's another of Captain John 's tricks . - What 're you doing ? - If Gwen used the phone here , I can use the network to triangulate the location . where she answered her last call . Got it ! This is where she made the call . Open every container door ! She 's in here ! Gwen , it 's all right . We 're here with you . What happened ? What 's he done to her ? She 's still breathing , no discernible injuries . - Tosh , let 's get this thing started . - Ianto , take a swab . Right , pupils dilating , she 's still conscious . Stay with us , darling . He 's poisoned her . Anti-toxin kit now ! Gwen , hold on . Had to go and steal a car . Get yourself noticed . Now ... OK ... Pretty and resilient . Is that even fair ? Maybe you didn 't realise . You can beat , shoot , threaten , and even poison us , and we keep coming back . Stronger every time . Well , I think you ought to know , your boss is splayed out on the ... Pavement . Now that 's impressive . Seriously , you can earn ... a fortune in the Vegas galaxies with an act like that . Go on , how 's it work ? I can 't die . Huh ... - No but , really ... - No , but really , you can 't kill me . No matter how many times you try . I can 't die . Ever . But what does it cost you ? Every time you have to drag yourself back here , how does it feel ? All ... that pain and trauma . Plus , you 're reborn into this godforsaken mess . I pity you . These people , this planet , all the beauty you could never see . That 's what I come back for . Well , goody on you . What 's in the canisters ? It 's come clean time , Captain . Yeah , all right . That woman I told you about , had herself an Arcadian diamond , the rarest gem in the Damascene Cluster . Just when I 'd got my hands on her , she only generates her own personal riftstorm . God , I hate technological geniuses . You said this was a dying woman 's request . Yeah , she was dying . I shot her . Thought my luck had changed when I found it had ended up here . So , I 'm thinking 50 / 50 ? Even split , good deal . Or if anyone fancies an orgy ? - Open it . - What , not even a please ? Don 't your manners get brought back to life too ? Now ! This should give us the location of the diamond . There she is . The woman you murdered . You 've travelled several galaxies for this . Well done . Thank you , gorgeous . Except ... There 's no diamond . What ? Only this . No , no , no . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , ... It 's got to be a diamond . It 's all about the diamond ! What the hell is that ... It 's an explosive device , which will latch on to the DNA of whoever killed me . It 'll detonate in ten minutes . It can 't be removed without exploding , so ... don 't bother trying . Goodbye ... lover . - No Wait . - See you in hell ! She can 't be serious . Ten minutes . Get it of me ! Actually , nine minutes 50 , 49 , 48 ... Always at the ready ! OK , how big is this explosion likely to be , Jack ? That technology , that size ... big . So , we should get him out of the city . Nine minutes 37 . You 've got to help me ! Please . Why ? Let her go . Jack , help me ! Get back ! What 've you done ? ! It 's hypersteel , impermeable , deadlock sealed . No way to undo them . Unless you have this key . You are UNBELIEVABLE ! And yet , you still find me strangely attractive . Now YOU had better find a solution pronto or she 'll be blown up with me ! Would shooting him stop the DNA trigger ? No . So , what are we gonna do now , team ? The orgy 's still on offer by the way . - Especially now the cuffs are out . - Nine minutes , four seconds . Tosh , the rift predictor program , have you perfected yet ? - Pretty much . - What ? - Anything in the next few minutes ? - Gwen , no way . What 's she talking about ? If we 're in the rift when that disc explodes , the city will be safe . - How does that save us ? - It doesn 't . Eight 32 , 31 ... - You 're bluffing . - Try me . The car park where he arrived . The crack in the rift is still active up there . That 's where we 're going . Somebody better start doing something . - Cut his hand off . - That would activate the bomb . Don 't make me pull you ! Get up the stairs , now ! Five minutes 22 . I can 't find the frequency the device works on . There 's no chance of jamming it ! Where 's Jack ? He should be here . What I 've been saying all along , unreliable . Shut up ! I think I 'm starting to see what he likes about this place . She 's beautiful , he 's stunning . Don 't you ever stop ? What five minutes to live , you want me to behave . - Oh , that 's gorgeous . - That 's a poodle . That 's nice . - This better work . - Trust me , I 'm an improviser . Out ! - Ok . - Get out ! I do love a woman who 's rough . 51 seconds . You 're not really gonna sacrifice yourself , are you ? 45 seconds . We have to go . No ! What about a last-minute rescue ? Why be on a team if you don 't get a last-minute rescue ! 40 seconds . Tell ... Tell Jack ... Tell Jack I ... 30 seconds . Now what 's he doing ? Get off me ! Owen , it 's not working . 15 seconds ! - What are you doing ? ! - Trying to confuse the disc ! - Why hasn 't it worked ? - I don 't know ! - 12 seconds ! - Jack , do something ! I 've gotta go , Jack . Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One ! Go ! Run ! What the hell ? Jack , what 's going on ? Why 's it gone dark ? The rift 's reverted to the moment he came through . Everything 's jumped back to the beginning of the night . Like you were never here . Now we 've got to avoid ourselves , great ! It 's a temporal displacement ! Makes your tongue tingle , doesn 't it ? Lovely ! What was in the syringe ? Torchwood DNA . What ? DNA samples from the five of us , fused and injected into his heart . Temporarily corrupted his DNA coding , confused the disc . You mean , there 's a bit of all of you inside of me ? Sweet goddesses , that 's all I need . Thank you , Owen . - You 're welcome . - I want you gone . Well , we 've got to work out a way to get these off first . Actually ... Old Artesian trick . Keep it in the lining of the throat . Has a lot of uses . - You had that all along ? - You were my passport to survival . No hard feelings . Well , not in that sense . Remind me never to get on your bad side . Definitely bigger . - If you need a new team member ... - No . - Really ? I could ... - No . - But ... - No . Go now , and you can harness the residual rift energy . - Listen ... - Goodbye . OK . Oh ! By the way ... I meant to tell you ... I found Gray . Who 's Gray ? It 's nothing . Let 's get back to work . Have you never seen something so mad , so extraordinary , that just for one second you think that there might be more out there ? Who are you people ? You 're Torchwood , yes ? There 's a rift through space and time that runs through Cardiff , stuff slips through from other times and planets and we monitor it . Stop wasting our time , we know you 're an alien . There 's no such thing as aliens . Get away from me ! What is it , not spooky enough ? Honestly , it 's just sex , sex , sex with you people . You have picked the wrong girl to stalk , mate . When are the others coming ? They 're already here . Oh my God ! Welcome to Planet Earth . - Who the hell is this ? - Miss Martha Jones . A human being who 's travelled in time and space . You really are something special . What 's happening ? I don 't know . Toshiko , show me the city now . They 're everywhere . You 're the only one who can stop this . If you don 't it 's the end of everything . You always remember what you killed . Alien Jack ? Nuclear warheads , ten of them . It 's all over . Let 's all have sex . And I thought the end of the world couldn 't get any worse . Come on what do we do ? Just keep watching . Keep doing what we do .

 Captain 's report . February 4 , 2531 . Five years . Five long years . That 's how long it took us to get Harvest back . Go ! go ! go ! Move on ! I am hit ! Keep firing ! Go , come on . At first it was going well ... .. then setback after setback ... .. loss after loss . Made , what was going to be a quick and decisive win ... .. five years of hell . Of course that 's all Harvest is , today . It 's hell down there . But now it 's ours , again . System Epsilon 9 , Xatsa February 4 , 2531 3 : 20 pm on battleship HALO Serina , status . Standard orbit achieved , all systems normal . Prep for Podlaunchers , bring weapon systems online . Expecting trouble , Captain ? Harvest maybe ours again ... .. but I don 't think the Covenant appreciate that , yet . Sgt. Forge , report . Definitely plenty of bad guys down here , Captain ... .. and they found something in the ice . Damn it . That complicates our mission . - Anders , what have you got ? - Captain ... Scans of the northern polar region shows some ... .. interesting Covenant activity on the surface . There is some kind of structure down there . What do you think they 're looking for ? That 's what we are here to find out . We 're to bring Alfa base up to operational status ... .. and take control over that site . I get my equipment , Captain . Lady , there is no way you 're coming down here on the first bird . Sgt. Forge , pull back to Alpha Base , I 'm sending you some backup . - Roger that . Forge out . - So , nothing too difficult , then ? It might be the key to this whole war , Serina . It 's worth the risk . Let 's just take one last look , Sam . The Hierarchs are impatient . We can delay no longer . What if the infection defiles the relic ? I care not for your little life . Open the relic . Well , well ... .. open sesame . What made you choose my observation deck as your lab , Professor ? I like the view . It adds .. perspective to my work . Forge doesn 't think it 's safe for you to go down there , yet . He is quite insistent . I can be quite insistent , too , captain . I can take care of myself . Any idea , what it is we 've got down there ? It 's all theories , right now ... .. and I 'll know a lot more once I get down there . I am approving the mission , ... .. but the slightest sign of danger , and I 'm pulling you out . - Is that understood ? - Understood , Captain . Hierarch , the humans are closing . They soon will be upon us . No matter , the information you 've gathered here , is most dramatizing . However , we must protect what we 've learned here . Set the charges and destroy this place . Destroy this holy relic ? Surely , you just ... The journey requires sacrifice ! Set the charges. return to us . Our patience is not infinite ! It will be done . Spiro 5 , this is Blue 6 We join with Blue 5 . We are on route to the recon patrol 's last known position . Six , out . Blue 6 , Blue 6 , We are under attack ! This is farm group Omega , if they want war ... .. we 'll give them war ! Sgt. , is this is what the aliens were after ? Seems so , mom . They sure paid a price , trying to defend it . All quite , now . Hey , what are you doing ? Nothing ventured , nothing gained . Now , that 's not what I expected . Heresy , remove this filth ! - Take cover . - Go ahead . These guys , just don 't know when to quit . One down . - No ! - Spirit Forge ... .. we 're gonna need a loose backup . So , all it did , was point here . In the 30 seconds I had to examine the artifact ? Yes , all it did , was point at a second star system . Arcadia Colony , to be precise . Population a little under three million ... .. largely unexplored , but ... .. apparently quite a vacation resort . There 's something there , Captain . I think it 's important to get to it , before the Covenant do . Our orders are to investigate Harvest . We still don 't know a lot , about what 's going on down there . I understand that , Captain . But everything I see here , tells me that we need to get to Arcadia ... .. to figure this out . Very well , Professor . I 'll clear it with Admiral Kow . Serina , set course for Arcadia . Aye , sir . Crazy , mystery trip to Arcadia , plotted in ... .. spinning up FTL drive . Serina , get out of my lab . System Procyon , Arcadia February 9 , 2531 Serina , situation update , please . Two Covenant vessels came out of slip-space near Arcadia . The Belfast , Pillar of Autumn , Texas and Armstrong engaged immediately ... .. and caught one with its shields down . We lost the Texas and Belfast ... The Armstrong is venting atmosphere , and Autumn is badly damaged . The second vessel is engaged in surface activity . What kind of surface activity ? Unknown . Wait . I 'm getting a signal . Audio , only . We 're being overrun , the alien forces are inside the city limits ... .. and approaching the Space Board . We are still evacuating civilians , we need help . Getting visuals now , captain . Serina , launch Pods , bring the ship to alert ! Arbitrar , you 're unusually quiet . What troubles occupy your thoughts ? Hierarch , I do not wish to be impudent ... .. but you have charged me , with the destruction of humanity . A most noble cause for one with such a troubled past . And I am thankful for my task ... .. but Sir , you have me stalking ancient ruins ... .. and search empty temples . How does this help me accomplish my goal ? The war with the humans will require ... .. a great deal more machines , that we can currently master . - I will take what we have ! - And leave us defenseless ? No , the Ancients will provide for us . This world , shall be the birthplace for an invasion fleet , beyond imagining . Enough to crush the humans quickly , and with ease . But this world lies dormant . It is just a shell . Blasphemy ! The key will be found with patience . But perhaps there 's a quicker way . The human female from the ice relic ... .. she has some knowledge in this regard . The new planet the relic has led us to ... .. has also led her . Capture that human and bring her here ! It will be done . So , it 's an energy shield that they can deploy on the planet ? Yes , Captain . We can 't see through it ... .. the Covenant are up to something . Agreed . We need to find out what that is . Can we use the ship 's cannons and take it out directly ? We may destroy whatever is under there . Covenant shield technology is susceptible to superheated plasma . Aren 't we field testing some plasma based rhinos ? Pillar of Autumn inventory shows they have some prototypes . It may take some time to get the right power cells . I 'll need to be on the ground to do that . Professor , Sgt. Forge , let 's get that shield down ! Babysitting , again ? How about , one for the scrapbook , Professor ? If you don 't mind ... Sgt I am trying to document this area for study . - You will come with me . - Why don 't we put the lady down ... .. and talk about this man to freak ? As you wish . - Stop ! - Anders , get out of here ! I 'll come quietly , if you let him live . - Sir ? - I 'm OK ! Spirit of Fire , this is Forge . I lost Anders . - What happened ? - Some massive elite came out of nowhere . Captain , I am tracking her transponder . It is heading away from the planet . Damn it . Sgt. , get up here , on the double . Already en route , sir . We are all accounted for . Why 'ven 't we left , yet ? Why aren 't you in the med bay , Sgt. ? The Professor 's signal , has gone to light speed , headed for the border . That puts it outside weapon 's range . What ? We have to go after her ! Sir , I can only track that transponder a few more seconds . - Captain ! - Sir ... Anders represents a significant security breach . Serina , get us under way immediately . Follow that signal . Aye , aye , sir . So , we left a note , saying we 're leaving , right ? February 23 , 2531 . Where the hell are we , Serina ? We 're in orbit around a planet in the middle of ... .. actually I 'm still working on that , Sir . Anders ? The Covenant vessel we pursued ... .. appears to have taken cover on the planet 's surface . I have rough coordinates . - Any sign of other Covenant activity ? - Not that I can detect . Although this world is giving off some pretty crazy readings . Get Forge down there . I believe he is already aboard the Pelican , awaiting your word . - This is her ? - Yes , Hierarch . - This is the one I observed . - Such a frail , thing . You would hardly think them a threat . I demand to know why I 'm being held ! Demand ? Arbitrar , a human ship has arrived , and is closing in on the entrance portal . Get the Hierarch to High Charity ... .. intercept that human ship and destroy it at once ! Nothing but ocean . Are you sure this is it , Serina ? Fairly sure . Initiating deep scan . Docking , cleansing , that 's not right . Captain , you 're not gonna like this . - Serina ? - Captain , we got company . All hands , engage . Serina , I got troops down there , still . Get them back on board , now ! Captain , I can only hold this position a few minutes at the most . Now , Serina ! Recalling surface squads , so that we all can die together . Aye , sir . This is all part of the plan , right guys ? - Hard starboard ! - Hard starboard , aye . Captain , they are charging weapons . Battle stations , bring weapons online . Tell Forge he is not done out there , yet . Alerting the Sgt , aye Sir . Sir , am I the only one freaked out by the fact that we are inside the planet ? Restraints off . Your judgment has waited long enough . Just , get it over with ! The ancients have given us the power to doom your race . Let the deconstruction of our gifts begin . The majesty of our new fleet will be unparalleled . Nothing ventured ... Surface . That worked out pretty well . Or maybe not . Lady , I haven 't got all day . You want to be rescued , or not ? Is this really going to work , Professor ? I believe this is our best hope . The overloaded FTL reactor will cause a chain reaction in the sun . Enough to destroy all the ships here , before the Covenant ... .. can get a chance to make anything from them . Well , put simply , Captain ... .. our reactor will cause the sun to go supernova ... .. leaving nothing here but dust . That 's the weak part of this plan , if you ask me . We have no way home without that reactor . One problem at a time , Serina . If the Covenant get their hands on these ships ... .. it will mean the end of the war . We 'll take our chances here . Give humanity some hope . I know it 's been a tough call , Captain . But it 's the right one . Spirit of Fire , this is Forge . She is buttoned up and ready to go . Deliver that package safely , Sgt. Keep the coffee hot . We 'll be back before you know it . I 'll be monitoring you from here , Sgt. Well , it 'll be pretty obvious , if he succeeds ... Gentlemen , we 're burning sunshine here . It 's active ! Sgt. Lt. ? Take care of those elites . He 's mine . Let 's go ! Like the rest of your race , weak and undisciplined . There will be no female , to save you , this time . Look me in the eye and say that . As you wish . My face will be the last thing your pathetic eyes ever see . And for the record ... .. I would have kicked your ass the first time , if the lady hadn 't stopped me . Sir , it 's already overheating . I have to separate the core , and align it manually when we need to blow . Son , I have a feeling before this is over , we 'll need every last spark in the fight . I can do this . Report back to the ship . Good luck Sir , it 's been an honor . Hangar bay reports all crews checked in . Let 's not outstay our welcome . Best speed away ! Captain , the gravity field from the sun is expanding . We 're not going anywhere . Let 's see if we can turn that to our advantage . Serina , plot a course that takes us into the sun . We 're going to slingshot around it . Threading a needle ... .. while accelerating around an exploding star ... .. inside a planet that is falling apart ? Sure ! Why not ? Serina , can you do it ? It 's done . You might want to hold on to something . Closing your eyes might help , too . Dyx Ogna , Checkpoint 3 March 11 , 2531 Captain , I 'd much rather stay awake to monitor this area . Professor , there 's been no sign of the Covenant for almost 2 weeks . - There is nothing to do . - But , Captain ! But , nothing , Professor . You got us all out of there alive . Get some rest . Not all of us , Captain . Not all of us .

 Lines are open now , so now 's your chance . In other news , still no information on the disappearance of six Lansdale residents . - Forgot my gear . - Hurry . Don 't wanna miss kickoff . - Anyone suspicious , please contact Sheriff Golightly 's office . All calls are anonymous . That 's it for me . Joe Clark is up next to keep you company on the way home . I used to play around with hearts CO-WORKER : Let 's go , Raymond . What 's the holdup ? RAYMOND : Just a second . When I met that little girl I knew that I would fall Poor little fool Oh , yeah I was a fool - Uh-huh - Uh-huh Poor little fool I was a fool Oh , yeah She played around and teased me With her carefree , devil eyes She 'd hold me close and kiss me But her heart was full of lies Poor little fool Oh , yeah - Uh-huh - Uh-huh Poor little fool I was a fool Oh , yeah She told me how she cared for me CO-WORKER : Raymond ! Raymond . NURSE : There you go . - Thank you . - You take care , Agent Dunham . - I will . - Let me get that . - Peter , I 'm fine . I know you are . What ? Well ... Just looking for the hidden ninja sword . Well , that one wasn 't covered by insurance . Thank you . - Did you check the drawers ? - No . Anything I have forgotten , they can keep . I don 't wanna spend another minute here . I 'm no good at sitting around . You 're also no good at letting people help you . Well , I 'll let you carry my suitcase . Did you get me everything on my list ? FBI signed off on everything including new housing for you and your father . But the C-130 transport plane is proving a bit tough to requisition . We 're not gonna need it for this one . Pennsylvania ? I was trolling the FBI databases looking for cases similar to Olivia 's . Sudden disappearances . This town has had six missing people in two months . Four of which , eyewitnesses say just disappeared into thin air . I thought it was worth checking out . - How is she ? - Olivia ? She 'll be fine . Do it . And keep a close eye on Dunham . All right , Walter , the cameras are ready . Here we go . - Agent Dunham , you 're just in time . - Just in time for what ? We 're re-creating your car accident . Okay , Astrid , ready . Three , two , one . The photographs , quickly . I know , Walter . Your accident , I 'm testing a theory . Oh . Thank you . No matter what I try , I can 't make the frog disappear . - We 've been at this for five hours . - Science is patience . It 's also slimy . From all the evidence you were missing from your car for at least an hour before you came crashing back through the windshield . You simply disappeared . He thinks you traveled to another universe . You see , Agent Dunham we assume that our universe is the only universe . That 's not true . There is an infinite number of universes and in each of them , there is a version of us . You , me , Agent Farnsworth . Each one slightly different . Changed over time based on the accumulation of our choices . So in this reality ... Walter . We 've had this conversation before , haven 't we ? I know that I went somewhere . I think I met with someone . But the rest is like a dream that I just can 't quite remember . Perhaps you will . In time . When they said you were dead ... When I saw you lying there ... I don 't know what I would have done . Walter . But you 're here now and apart from the obvious you appear to be fine . - I appear to be ? You know , traveling to an alternate reality has its consequences . No . No , you 'll be fine . Hey . You feel up to going for a drive ? Hello . Hello . Hello , I 'm Walter Bishop . Hello . Sheriff Golightly ? Special Agent Olivia Dunham . This is Peter and Walter Bishop . - Don 't remember calling the FBI . - Your offices filed six missing persons reports . Seven now . Seven ? All under the same circumstances ? Same as the others . Just disappear . - Be damned if I know what to make of it . - We 're all victims of our own gene pool . Someone must have peed in yours . I 'm sorry , you 'll have to excuse my father . Excuse me . Sheriff these two men are both special investigators with the FBI . When the men and women who 've come from three counties have finished collecting evidence , then you can see it . Let me see what you got . May I ? - Wonderful . - Have you run across this before ? Absolutely not . The air here is quite auspicious . Makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck . - The air ? - This . A fresh mystery . Pregnant with possibilities . Who knows where it may lead ? I 'll bet you he knows . Here are the investigation files . Everything we have so far from the first disappearance , but not a hell of a lot . Possible-suspect interviews . Case leads , dead-ends from the disappearances . Okay , thank you . Agent Dunham . The FBI has very specific laws that govern what their jurisdiction involves . None of these disappearances occurred on a military base none happened across state lines . - You 've already given us evidence . There 's information in the files . - I can get a special procedural order ... - Why are you so interested in this case ? - Excuse me ? - Why are you so interested in this case ? I , um ... - I 'm sorry , I ... - Night of Desirable Objects ? I have one just like this . Yeah ? Ha , ha . You know yourself a bit about night fishing ? I 've used hair jigs and pork rind . Rubber jigs for largemouth . - You ever tried using Spinnerbaits ? Oh , yeah . You can use pork rind with those . Can you really ? Yeah . I like the topwater ... CHARLIE : Agent Francis . - Hey , it 's me . - Hey . - Look , I 'm sending you a victim sheet from a multiple-missing-persons case in Pennsylvania . Can you run the names and notify me if any red flags come up ? Sure . I just have to run an errand . Okay . Thanks , Charlie . Bye . STORE OWNER : I 'll be with you in just a minute . CHARLIE : I need the back room . Now . Well , this is wildly helpful . According to the sheriff , the second man to disappear ? His mom makes a mean apple pie . In case you 're wondering , Andre Hughes is partial to flannel . He likes to wear flannel shirts , except , of course , in the summer . I 'm gonna go get a soda . You want something ? No , thank you . Hm . - How 's it going , Walter ? - I plan to urinate in 23 minutes . - Good to know . - I told you because I 'm going to need help unzipping my fly . I can 't feel my hand . It seems this substance from Pennsylvania is a paralytic . Whoever took those people paralyzed them first , so they couldn 't fight back . Interesting theory . Very devious . Do you think we can trace it ? Where it 's from ? The base solution contains human DNA . Male , I think . Of course , it 's a mutation . Perhaps a whole new stage of human evolution . Wouldn 't that be fantastic ? If we 've stumbled upon a mutant ? No . Fantastic 's not the first word that pops to mind . We 're all mutants . What 's more remarkable is how many of us appear to be normal . - Find anything ? - Hey , you remember Andre Hughes ? Yeah . Hughes . He was the flannel guy , right ? Yeah , well , he 's a neighbor of the Shanes . He was at their house when the sheriff went to follow up on their son . He was also at the Thomason 's just after Jennifer Thomason disappeared . Sheriff Golightly arrived as Hughes was leaving . - What are you thinking ? - I 'm thinking you drive . HUGHES : No . No . No . Oh , hell . Oh , hell . - Who are you ? - Mr. Hughes ? Olivia Dunham . This is Peter Bishop . We 're wanting to ask you a few questions . FBI ? Oh . Uh ... I assume you 've heard about the people that have recently gone missing . Yup . I know about it . I 'd love to help if I can . Please . After you . Either of you have any experience with water wells ? No . This time of year , I spend most of my time maintaining them . Digging them out . I wouldn 't wish it on either of you . It 's like to drive me crazy . This is my fifth well in two months . I can 't seem to find that sweet spot . I 'm just gonna go in the other room and wash this dirt off . Make yourself comfortable . Excuse me . Is there someone else in this house ? No . There 's someone else in this house . Did you hear that ? Keep him busy . Come out of there . Oh , Peter . Oh , my God . Peter , oh , my God . I 'm so sorry . I thought I heard something . I thought I heard someone . HUGHES : You fired a gun in my house and now you 're bringing me down here . I don 't understand . You don 't think I had anything to do with these missing people , do you ? At the moment , Mr. Hughes we 're just trying to gather information . So I understand that you 're a doctor . Yes . But you retired . - Nearly 20 years ago . - That 's right . Anything ? - Not yet . What 've you done since ? We scoured the house . No evidence linking him to the disappearances . Just a bunch of old lab equipment . Had it packed up , sent to Harvard . Walter 's taking a look at it now . According to our records , in the wake of the disappearances you visited with some of the victims ' relatives . With Martin Shane 's mother and Jennifer Thomason 's husband . - Yes . - Were they former patients ? - No . - Just friends ? I hardly knew either of them . But I thought I could help them . I ... I thought I could comfort them . I lost my wife and my son 17 years ago . She died giving birth to him . He was mine . For five minutes , I had a son . I could never hurt these people . Mr. Hughes , we 'd like to take a sample of your blood . We 'd like to compare it to some evidence that we found at the scene of the last disappearance . Do we have your permission to do that ? Am I under arrest ? Not presently . Then , no . No . You don 't have my permission . I 'll get a warrant to take his blood . Have Olivia hold him for 24 hours . It says in her report , Dunham 's gun went off . Yeah . Misfire . Mr. Hughes . HUGHES : I lost my wife and my son ... I 'll send Agent Jessup to the Hughes ' house . DOCTOR : Dizziness ? No . - How 's your short-term memory ? - What 's your name ? Good . You seem to be doing well . You can go ahead and get dressed . Hello , Agent Dunham . I haven 't had a chance to visit since your accident . But Agent Broyles has been keeping me apprised . I was concerned . Well , thanks . I 'm doing okay . I 'm glad to hear that . Though , sometimes the physical injury is the easiest to get over . I remember when I was first diagnosed with cancer . Beside the fear , my most overwhelming sensation was one of betrayal . The realization that my own body was fundamentally foreign to me . That it was a threat . You 've been through quite an ordeal , Olivia . One of many lately . To overlook it would be a mistake . What 's this ? Sam Weiss . The man who helped put me back together . You know , the FBI has psychologists . - Lf I thought that I needed ... - Oh , he 's not a psychologist . When you 're ready , I believe he can help you . Okay , thanks . That was Olivia . Agent Jessup told her Hughes may have killed his wife and child 17 years ago . Finally some good news . I assume we can dig them up . I haven 't had any bodies to examine . Seven missing persons , no bodies . All right , I 'll get an exhumation order . Put his wife 's coffin down here . Hughes is hiding something . We 're gonna find out what it is . Okay , let 's open it up . Let 's open the baby boy 's . Oh , my God . There 's no body . Looks like something dug its way in . Or dug its way out . I think we have some questions for Mr. Hughes . That 's curious . What ? What 's curious ? Mrs. Hughes has scarring to the joints , butterfly lesions to the face . Systemic lupus erythematosus . A very advanced case . - Lupus ? - Which means what ? Well , notably , she was incapable of producing offspring . Except she did . She had a baby boy . Yeah . A baby boy ? That 's impossible . Lupus results in an overactive immune system . Her own body would have destroyed the fetus long before ... Yes , and yet , despite that , she was somehow able to give birth to a son . Who from all appearances , then burrowed his way out of his casket . The grave of a boy who is not in his grave . How the hell did this happen ? Why wasn 't anyone watching ? We 're looking into it right now . We need to have Andre Hughes' body taken back to Walter Bishop 's lab as soon as possible . - Already on its way . Hey , Jim , it 's Alex . Yeah , I know I 'm late . Yeah , I 'm leaving right now , all right ? I understand . I 'll take care of it . I 'll call him right now . Agent Dunham ? Agent Dunham ? Peter , I 've got it . Mrs. Hughes ' womb . You were right , she did give birth . I 'm glad we got that settled . The afterbirth is still inside . Look at the tissue composition . Walter , according to this , Hughes ' baby wasn 't entirely human . It explains his research . Reproductive biology and gene replacement . I hypothesize that he may have used some scorpion DNA . I mean , it 's an incredibly resilient creature . And also possibly something that lives underground , a mole rat . Scorpions paralyze their prey with toxin . Could explain the liquid . - What 'd I miss ? - Hughes ' baby . He altered it . Inside the womb so it could survive the lupus . - Okay , that is sick . That is brilliant . He 's created a super baby . One capable of surviving in the most inhospitable environment . Oh , Agent Dunham , we 've had a breakthrough . I heard . Hughes ' son . I think I might know where he is . When we were at the Hughes ' house , I heard a noise , like something breathing . I thought that I had imagined it , but I didn 't . So if Hughes ' son is alive I think he is somewhere in that house . - Or near that house . - Or under it . Hello ? Sheriff Golightly ? Peter . Hey . I think it 's a canine tooth . Oh . Ugh . Confirmed . Dog . Ugh . Gonna grab a shovel . Uh ! Peter ? Yeah ? Aah ! Aah ! Peter ! Aah ! - Olivia ! - Oh , no ! Olivia . God ! Peter ! Ahh ! He must have realized that it was his son because we found traps set in all of these holes that he 'd dug all over his property . Could you imagine living with a burden like that ? When all you wanted was a son ? Charlie , what if I don 't want to remember ? - You mean , your accident ? - All of it . Where I went . Who I met with . What he told me . I mean , what if there 's a part of my brain that 's trying to protect me ? I 'm just not sure you have much of a choice here , Olivia . If Walter was correct about you going to that other universe then whatever secrets you learned might be worth remembering . " Another universe . " I never thought that I would ever hear you utter those words with a straight face . You 've come a long way , Charlie Francis . Well , you know , whatever it is , we 'll deal with it together . I 'll help you remember . I know you will . Are you going fishing , son ? Yes . But not alone . Oh , no ? Who with ? Well , once upon a time , there was a young man probably around 10 or 11 who got it in his head that he wanted to take his father fishing . So he saved up all the money from his paper route and bought a very special lure . Oh ... It 's called " the night of desirable objects . " Sadly , his father was never really all that available to him . So , what started out as a would-be bonding experience ended up with a young man fishing alone in a boat . And this young man gave this to you ? Yes , Walter . Can I come with you and your friend ? You know what , Walter ? I think that would make the trip . Good . Good . WOMAN 1 : she said you guys can have a sleepover this weekend . MAN 1 : You always do that . WOMAN 2 : I don 't always do it . I just did . MAN 1 : Every single time , it 's the same thing over and over ... MAN 2 : I can 't find the remote . MAN 3 : Check under the cushion , man . WOMAN 2 : I 'm on the phone . MAN 4 : Hey , what 's up , man ? MAN 5 : Let 's go . Move it . Something to make us all happy Do anything , take us out of this gloom Sing a song , play guitar , make it snappy You are the one who can make us all laugh If you wanna bowl , we close in 15 minutes . No . I 'm looking for Sam Weiss . - Is he here ? - Sam ? No . Well , do you know where I could find him ? Atlanta , Georgia . He met a girl . Moved away . Oh . Thank you . That 's it ? Excuse me ? You 're giving up ? I tell you he met a girl and moved away and you 're just gonna give up ? You 're Sam . Nina Sharp said you 'd be coming by . Have the headaches started yet ? No . They will . What are you ? A size eight ?

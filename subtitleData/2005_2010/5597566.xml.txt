 " Ready for the action now , Danger Boy " Ready if I 'm ready for you , Danger Boy " Ready if I want it now , Danger Boy " How dare you , dare you , Danger Boy " How dare you , Danger Boy " I dare you , dare you , Danger Boy " Now , if I 'm going to spend all that money ... and for the support of a system that 's not effective to begin with ... I might as well do something else here . Something that won 't hurt them so much . Border containment is a joke with this present situation . What is it you have in mind , Your Honour ? Oh , I don 't know . Like scissors , huge scissors ... to clamp shut , right in the way , just cut it off . If they 're in the middle of it , cut them off . Know what I mean ? Cut what off ? People want to stay . It 's the power of ideas . You 're getting soft , Goodchild . The men at the club have noticed . Your game is flagging . You should get out more , see what you 're missing . Every time you turn around , he 's started some new project ... but he 's no visionary . He 's just another Breen . Yes . Trevor Goodchild . They 're all a bunch of power junkies , toying with our lives . In Monica , there are no rulers . That 's why Goodchild hates them . There 's no head of state to negotiate with . So , D-Section is our best bet , you think ? Sybil , we 've been through this . You hesitate . If you hesitate , you 've failed already . I hate that . You 'd send your kid in there if you wanted to get rid of him . Or your lover , if you wanted to get rid of her . What ? I 'm gonna make it , Onan . I 'll show you how weak I am . Remember when you gave me these ? Come , woman . We are free . We need nothing . - Do you have that file ready yet ? - Right . Hold on . Sybil . All personnel , here it is . Remember , we can 't pay attention to each other . What a waste . Just take her in to General ? No , I 've hands-on on this one . How are you feeling ? Monica ? - Is this Monica ? - No . No , no , no ! About the damage , Sybil ... you don 't have enough to cover it all , of course . You 'll have to work it off , as well as your repair bill . Repair ? You have a gap , Sybil , a credibility gap . Your citizenship is in question ... but you 've been conscripted anyway . - Where ? - 7981 Plant ... the medical parts facility . The one that 's always being bombed ? Bombings have created quite a stir in the local community ... where the warehouse is located . The warehouse is one that is very important ... What kind of means do you believe are being employed ... to wreak such destruction ? Pretty heavy-duty . Portable anti-aircraft material or something of the kind . Have you determined for certain that this is not an inside job or ... Impossible . It 's Monican all right . Onan ! Sybil ? Are you okay ? I saw you get hit . You were shot . Onan . Onan , how is it there ? I 'll be with you soon , I promise ... but , listen , my next door neighbour , she 's a Monican terror agent . Really ? Yes , and she crosses the border all the time . Find out how she does it . Meet me here again tomorrow . - Yes , I 'll go to her . - Yes . - And I 'll do this for you . - Yes . I just want to be with you again ... but I don 't know if I can ever make it , Onan . Yes , Sybil , you must . Give yourself a chance . I know you 'll make it in the end . I saw your border run . Nice going . Thanks . Do you think she 'd stand a chance if she were to ... Try it again ? Forget it . She 'll never make it . You could have told her that before . She would have never listened . You 're shutting it down with her , I take it . Well , you know , I feel abandoned . She failed not only her own objectives ... - She 's failed your faith in her . - Yes . Perhaps I 'm prone to weak women ... because I have no concept of weakness or of like qualities . Well , okay , Onan . Sure . How do you like it ? Here , this is all wrong . Let me help you . Perk up , Onan . Here . Forget it , Onan . How do you do ? Fine , thank you . Please , come in . Now , let 's see . About your spine injury . Yes , Doctor . Was it as good for you as it was for me ? I don 't know what to say . I haven 't ever had it like this , you know ? Did you find anything wrong , Doctor ? Am I okay ? Oh , my God . Are you kidding ? You were sensational . I mean ... Sybil . Sybil . Sorry . Sybil . Do you need a job or anything ? I could use a new attach√© . - I 'm ... - Tell me you heart 's desire . One wish , and it 's yours . - Anything ? - Just no heads on plates . I 'm gonna get a drink . Would you like one ? No . No , thank you . Right . That would have been it , you know . Onan ? So what 'll it be ? Puppet strings , purse strings ? Mr. Goodchild , I want out . I want to transfer to Monican citizenship . That 's my wish . Do you know how lucky you are ? You 're the best I 've had yet . I 'll just find someone else with your specs ... now that I know what they are . Just get out . I mean , I think that I 'll leave now . - Sorry . - Sorry . You 're so right . I 've everything I 'd ever want here . We Breens , we 're spoiled rotten , aren 't we ? Just take me into the street and shoot me . The system is a defensive measure , Sybil . What do you think ? That it 's the way I prefer matters ? Look at me . I am what you 've done to yourself , you monster . But you 've heard it all before . You never listen . And we 're dying . Stop . Enough ! Onan , come here . That was pretty good . Sybil , you mean . Used to it . I 'll be in touch , Onan . I know what , Onan . I 'll just take you away from her . Maybe I should just kill you . No , that would make her even crazier . Besides , I 'm sure you 're good in bed . Hey , Onan ? What ? With her right there ? She 's ... I mean , I want to , but ... You want my what ? Okay , Onan . Come here . I 'm not asking you . I 'm commandeering your libido under Monican aegis . This is an authorised police action , lover . You are mine . Oh , Onan . I heard you grunting over there last night . Over there ? How 's it going ? Have you found out yet ? Sybil , I 'm trying , but it 's going to take time . I understand . - So who 's better for you ? - Stop it , Syb . You think I wanna be there any longer than I have to ? I 'm sorry . In any case , I still want you to make it across . You 've got to try again . I would . I 'll see you tomorrow . I love you . Take care . Sybil , don 't try it again . You can 't make it ... and Onan doesn 't love you . You 're headed for disaster . Don 't kill yourself . Is something bothering you ? Fine to play with my feelings ... but you 're involving innocent people , Trevor . What are you doing to that poor girl ? Jealous ? She intrigues me . Sybil , it 's me , your next door neighbour . I wanna help you , Sybil . Please . - Why ? - Just listen . I 'll be your escort to Monica . I 'm actually your best chance . Well , how very nice of you to offer . Oh , it 's nothing . I do it every day . All right , then . We 'll make an appointment for C-Section . C-Section ? I 'll do your anaesthesia on the spot . You 'll be with Onan again before you know what happened . That is , if you still want him . There 's a hook in that bait , and here you still want me to swallow it . Thanks . Get out . Get out ! This isn 't working . Sybil , that was wonderful . Yeah . It 's not the same anymore . What happened ? What do you mean delivery of ampoules has been waylaid ? I need them . Now . Wait . I have an incoming . Can you hold ? - Trevor ? - Sybil . Something 's very wrong . Examine me . Butter toes . I really wouldn 't mean to be intrusive . Oh , come on . We know what we 're thinking , and we know what we 're doing . Well , moderation in all things , you know ? Moderation is not abstinence . Moderation necessarily connotes use . Use ? So use me , Trevor . You must . I 've no choice . Lest you abandon your argument . Abandon all argument ? Yes . That 's it . So you like it over here , eh , killer ? What are you going to do now ? Ready for the action now , Danger Boy ? I hate it . I hate it . My box . My box , you took it away . Sybil , no . It 's your neighbour . She 's amuck . She 's the 7981-Plant saboteur . She says she uses C-Section to get across . There , I 've said it . Can 't you do something about this ? Sybil , I already knew about Aeon and C-Section . I was just waiting to hear it from your lips . See , you 're one of us after all . Oh , really ? Well , watch this . Sybil , listen to me . If you try to make it again , you will fail . I let Aeon do her bombing . They won 't let me shut down production . They never will . - Who won 't ? - Circumstances . Onan , I 'm returning you to Sybil . Sybil . Oh , my God . - Sybil . It 's not even ... - What ? It 's not even worth it . What are you talking about ? Give me a chance . Another chance ? It 's my chance for another chance now . Sybil , please . Sybil , wait ! Goodbye , Onan . You have disentried disrecognised space . Emergency is dispatched . No ! That which does not kill us ... makes us stranger .

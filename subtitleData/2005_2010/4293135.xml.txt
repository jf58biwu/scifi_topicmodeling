 Previously on " Bionic Woman " ... this saving the world thing ? i 'd like to give that a try . anything else ? what are you doing ? i 'm trying to buy back your love because i 've been working so much . you get some bad ideas in your head these days , don 't you , sarah ? it 's the bionics , isn 't it ? they 've changed me . turned me into this thing . we think sarah corvus might be working with anthony anthros . will 's father ? he escaped from prison . he tried to sell bionics to the highest bidder . am i ticking time bomb too ? i guess i just want to know the truth . about everything . i don 't like secrets , jaime . you 're not gonna kill me twice , are you ? and we all know that if your training is worth a damn , i should be ableto take this crowbar and swing it as hardand as fast as humanly possible--unh ! sync : ? ? Bionic.Woman.S01E04 ow ! god ! this is what you call studying at rachel 's house ? who the hell is she ? nobody . jaime , stop ! - you lied to me ! - let go of me ! you looked me right in the face and you lied . - oh , my god ! - you 're a piece of work , you know that ? - are you insane ? are you crazy ? - this is the thanks i get for buying you those $ 1,000 jeans ? what the hell is wrong with you ? you 're 15 years old . what the hell do you think you 're doing ? i 'm living my life , jaime . - it 's none of your business . - oh , yes , it is my business . hey , do you know she 's 15 years old ? you could go to jail ! - you said you were 18 . - shut up ! we 're going home . what did you do to my toe ? it 's my toe . and why does it hurt ? what happened to the self-healing anthrocytes ? well , you 're an early prototype , jaime . as time goes on , we 're gonna discover countless imperfections . that 's so not reassuring . and you 're giving me the creeps . you keep staring at it. do you have a foot fetish ? actually , no , jaime , i do not . i 'm pretty much just a simple boob man . you did this surveilling your sister ? she lied right to my face . just looked at me and lied . " i 'm going to rachel 's house . " well , that 's what teenagers do . they lie. they get tattoos . they have wild sex , and then knock off liquor stores . okay , your toe is screwed . i 'm gonna have to shock that thing into submission . now this shouldn 't hurt at all . on three . one . aah ! you suck ! here 's what i think . you cannot begrudge a teenage girl the opportunity to make out in parked cars with older guys . it 's the lying . isn 't this righteous indignation just a tiny bit hypocritical considering you 're a $ 50 million weapon - leading a double life ? - that 's mean . look , i don 't really care so much about what she does . i know she 's gonna make stupid mistakes and all that . i just don 't want her to lie to me because then i can 't help her . huh , that sounds good. tell her that . check it out. good as new . you 're a genius. yeah . let 's keep this between us , okay ? sure thing. thanks . * now i will tell you what i 've done for you ... * i 'll see you , and i 'll raise you all in . everything . that 's a lot of coin . you know , people say that men take all the risks . i 'm here to tell you it isn 't true . you all turn out to be a bunch of scared little boys . it 's disappointing. it really is . sarah , put your hands on your head . i guess the fun 's over . this is my boyfriend . it 's an on again off again sort of thing . you know how it is . i kill all those people . he shot me in the head . our friends call us the bickersons . isn 't that right , honey ? but you know what they say . at the end of the day the most important thing in the world ... is love . i knew the game was fixed . i 'm sorry . you owe me $ 27,269.31 for the toe . how 'd you find out about that ? your bionics represent the most advanced form of biotechnology known to man . it was developed to protect the human race , not spy on your delinquent sister . you know , i find your whole proprietary attitude about my body to be deeply inappropriate . how 's the toe ? take a look at this . my name is mark stevens . i 'm an american doctor working in paraguay . i 'm being held against my will . they say that they will kill me unless- - ? a group that calls themselves the sons of the red sand took stevens in ciudad del este two days ago . - they claim he 's cia . - is he ? he 's american. that 's enough for them . he 's got some incredibly sensitive information . and they 're gonna behead him in 48 hours unless the cia admits he 's theirs , which they won 't . so why is this our problem ? you mean besides the fact he 's an american who could gethis head chopped off ? i mean , why isn 't the military sending someone in ? paraguay never passed any anti-terrorism laws . they 're not about to let the u.s. mount an operation on their soil . - but we can ? - the two of you can . anything that looks like special ops is out . but an american couple moving about the city ? i want to help this guy , but i don 't think i can fly off to paraguay right now . becca- - becca will be watched 24 / 7 by a surveillance team . okay , i 'm in . just--what am i gonna tell becca ? you 'll think of something . * it 's hard to let the miles pass me by * * yellow lines blend together in my eyes * * and when the seasons change again then i will too ... * * but i just want to be closer to you * * i know you want to be closer to me * aah ... the eggs ! you were cooking ? who are you making breakfast for ? you . why are you making me breakfast ? about last night . i just want to clear the air . - i was - fine . look , i 'm sorry i lied to you . oh . yeah , i mean , i shouldn 't have done it . it was dumb . besides , that guy 's a creep anyway . i mean , usually those internet chat room guys , you know , they turn out to be reasonably cool . oh , my god ! i 'm kidding . god , you think i 'm retarded ? no , i don 't think you 're retarded . yeah , you do . so what 's going on with you ? um , well , carly invited me up to napa to celebrate her getting into law school . oh , well , that should be fun . mmm , yeah . we land on an airstrip . an airstrip ? is that different from an airport ? well , yeah , it 's dirt . i have an asset in place , a local cop . he 's gonna help us locate stevens when we get there . how can you land a 747 on a dirt runway ? no , it 's not a 747. it 's a little gulfstream . really ? you okay with that ? yeah , i 'm good . um , do you have any anti-anxiety meds ? sedatives ? anything in that area ? hi , jaime. how 's it going ? you look great . how 's becca ? stevens is running out of time . we have to go now . jonas will take care of her . okay ? come on . we 're almost done . i 'm just getting started . stop--aah ! let him go , sarah . take him to the infirmary . you 're not helping yourself . reflexes . your reflexes were recalibrated through sensory neurons with your original surgery . that was hostility . you noticed . a girl likes to be noticed . let 's cut to the chase . you 're having hand tremors , night sweats , anxiety , paranoia . even paranoids have enemies . the bottom line is the medicine anthros gave you barely gave you any relief . the truth is it probably made you worse . are you 're gonna fix me ? my hero. isn 't that what you want ? from you ? i want nothing . kill me or let me go . you know , i tried that once before . it didn 't work . this time i thought i 'd help . you don 't know how . will was working on an upgrade . i want anthony anthros . you tell me where he is , you get your life back . you 're full of crap , jonas . and you 're getting worse . who made me this way ? you 're a liar , jonas ! a liar playing god ! my contact has a very good idea where stevens is being held . he 's gonna meet us there . hook us up with some transportation when we- - you okay ? i 'm scared of flying . i couldn 't find any drugs , and i think getting wasted before a mission is a bad idea . i just think , you know , a hunk of metal in the sky . - counterintuitive . - okay . let 's talk about something else . okay . i 'm upset because i keep lying to my sister about my job . you 're protecting her. you 're not lying . if she knew the truth about you putting your life on the line , i don 't think she would be able to handle that . i don 't think i buy that . i think everybody should know the truth . no , the world just doesn 't work like that , jaime . but then how can you have trust ? trust and full disclosure is not the same thing . you trust me right ? relatively speaking . but what do you know about me , hmm ? what have i disclosed ? this is supposed to make me feel better ? all you need to know is that we 're a team and that i have your back . isn 't that enough ? thank you . e-e-e-easy , tiger ! easy , easy ! that 's your bionic hand . - that 's your bionic hand . - sorry . we must hurry . no one can know we 've met . remember , paraguay is a complicated place . we have no laws against terrorism . and this group has legitimate business interests . kidnap and ransom is legitimate ? all the perimeter doors are alarmed . the only other access is through the venting system . but it 's blocked by an exhaust fan . it 'll take your head off before they will . thanks. we 'll keep that in mind . if they catch you , i don 't know you . my police won 't help you . my opinion , for what little it 's worth , this is suicide . but you americans know all there is to know about handling these foreign situations , yes ? he 's an optimist . okay , we get in , we get him , we get out . sure , easy . there wasn 't supposed to be an alarm . just get us in . you know how to disarm it ? stevens ' life is ticking away . just do it . trust me . you 're a machine. don 't think about it . even if it 's not real , it 's still attached . i 'd like to keep it that way . give me a second . see ? matter over mind . what now ? are you crazy ? what the hell are you doing ? i suggest you follow my lead or you 'll be shot . you told me i could trust you . beauty is supposed to be the mark god sets upon virtue . and are you god in that homily ? she got less virtue than she bargained for . look , i know you don 't want to believe this , but every step of the way she had no bigger supporter than me . so why make her your enemy ? she needs help . will came up with a fix before he was killed . swap out the nerve bundles , infuse new anthrocytes . - so what are you waiting for ? - she knows where anthros is . he 's been giving her treatment . maybe if you fixed her , she 'd talk . chicken , egg . be her friend , jae . you want to help her ? help her help herself . at least we 're together . you 're out of your mind . we 're about to be executed . no , they 'll want to make an example out of us to stevens , or they 'll want to make an example out of him for us . either way , that gets us to him . i need you to lose the fear and go bionic . if i told you what i was going to do , you would 've backed out--unh ! friends of yours ? i believe , dr. stevens , that you don 't believe what will happen to you if you don 't decode the contents of your flash drive . which is nothing compared to what will happen to her . please , i 'm working as fast as i can . perhaps you need a little inspiration . wait , it 's a multi-level asymmetric encryption ! it 's gonna take time . allah akbar . now would be a good time , jaime . jaime , now ! jonas says he can help you . and he 's got every reason to lie . he 's also a man of self-interest . you 're valuable to him . he 's playing you . getting off watching this dance . or you 're playing me . i want you to know you can trust me . i want you back . we all want something back . even if jonas could help me , i don 't trust him . do you trust me ? bring me proof that jonas is telling the truth . that they made advancements they can use to fix me . i might remember where he can find anthros . take this rope . we 'll tie him and take him . take the rope , tie his hands up . we gotta move . what are you gonna do to him ? no worse than what he was going do to you . you want answers , right ? then when you 're done , take him down to the fan room . what about you and stevens ? what about me ? he stays . what are you talking about ? you deciphered the flash drive . you were stalling. you read it ! what was on the flash drive ? tell me . you . blueprints , materials , everything there is to know about bionics . if you know what was on that drive , then you know who gave it to me . to decipher , not to read . this doesn 't make any sense . we came here to save him . and we would have . i 'm not gonna say anything . yeah , until you 're caught , tortured , or your brother is taken . they put a machete to a pretty girl 's neck , you were gonna give it up . i was trying to save you . take him down to the fan room . so you 're just gonna kill him , is that it ? jaime , go. go ! far end of the building , fan room , i 'll meet you there , go . i told you i was gonna have your back , and i have your back . you let him go , he talks , you 're in the crosshairs . a target for people to catch and dissect . you won 't last a month . then i won 't . are you okay ? you 've been hit . go through . thank you . what you did back there . it was stupid . i 'm gonna get us both killed . i have no plan . you know that , right ? there 'll be supplies in here for your wound . we can 't stop . no , you can 't keep going . can you get the lock ? can you see what numbers to push ? your eye , can you tell what numbers ? 2569 . these are usually four digit codes . that gives us 24 combinations . let 's try it in reverse . highest probability . all right . who gave you the flash drive ? i have a contact. a voice on the phone . when he needs help , he tells me where to pick things up . what about the terrorists ? do you know who hired them ? i assumed it was just them . somebody tipped ' em off to what i was doing . okay , your body 's in shock . you really are a doctor ? it 's not just a cover ? yale medical school . two-year residency at walter reed . specialty in espionage ? i was always kind of a savant with word games and puzzles . how many words can you make out of the letters in yoo-hoo , that kind of thing . i was showing off one day at walter reed and a cia guy recruited me . you don 't feel that ? how bad ? the human response to a foreign object is to repel it and fight it like an infection . - but you ... - aren 't human ? you have anthrocytes . the files say they 're designed to keep your body from rejecting the bionics . so they work to incorporate what 's foreignand not repel it . doesn 't sound so bad . the anthrocytes are moving the bullet . it could damage other organs . i need to take it out . now . - she could be dead . - no , she 's not . she 's still green . it was your idea to send her in , jonas . and you nearly got her executed ! you know the risk involved better than anyone , buddy . no , no , no , willingly surrendering a $ 50 million bionic woman is not in my play book . well , it got us inside to get stevens and the flash drive . you don 't have the flash drive , and you don 't have jaime . well , how about i get off the phone so i can go and find her ? you better . and antonio ? you treat her like she 's expendable again , i won 't be this nice . do not tell me how to do my job . i 'm gonna go and get your girl back . carly ? what are you doing here ? nice to see you too . seriously , what are you doing here ? is everything okay ? yeah , i just borrowed these from jaime . she home ? no , she 's in napa ... with you . excuse me ? exactly . what are you looking for ? what you promised sarah . proof of will 's upgrades . you told me to get her trust . i 'm trying to get her trust . you didn 't trust me . there 's nothing here. no files at all . what is going on , jonas ? i don 't know . so you lied to me ? i told you will was working on fixes , not that i had them . apparently , the files are on a flash drive in paraguay . how ? i don 't think we knew will as well as we thought . ah , damn it ! sorry . not what you want to be hearing from your surgeon . how you holding up ? i 've been sitting here thinking about all the lies i 've been told . all the lies i 've been telling , even to myself . how do you make peace with it ? you don 't . you do what you can . sometimes you pay a price . three years ago , a lie i deciphered lead to a bombing raid in iraq . 87 civilians killed . another 113 injured . i 'm sorry . so i came to triple border ... to atone . doctoring people who have nothing . what about the cia ? occasionally they ask a favor . but now i only succeed at deciphering those things that i can live with . if you had told the terrorists what you knew about me , they might 've let you go . yeah , and i 'd have given them the technology to do what ? and then who would they have sold it to ? do the files say why it does that ? it stops after a few minutes ? yeah . what ? it 's your bionic interface ... failing ... and being reset . it keeps happening . it 's inherent in the system . and ? the anthrocytes function like an anti-rejection drug . but over time , they become fatigued . so they 'll replace them ? on the flash drive , it talked about a five-year projection . until what ? bionic systems cease to function . what does that mean ? what does that mean ? you 're gonna die . you can lead a horse to water , but you can 't make him drink . so that 's where we 're starting . with horses ? mr. ed won 't drink , you grab him by the mane , force him under . hold him there long enough , he 'll swallow . the point is to interpret the saying . you do know your horses . you and your sister had one when you were little.am i right ? and anne named it coco ? whatever happened to coco ? people who live in glass houses shouldn 't throw stones . or have sex without curtains . me , i like throwing stones . wakes people up . you 're caught between a rock and a hard place . now you 're just trying to be funny . actually , i 'm just trying to do my job , which as much as i don 't like it , means trying to understand you . i 'm messed up , honey . see , now we 're getting somewhere . does that make you all warm and cuddly inside ? you should know i don 't do warm and cuddly . you 're caught between a rock and a hard place . well , we both know how that ends , don 't we ? three . three ? you can make three words out of yoo-hoo . oh , yoo , and ooh. heh ! actually , nine . you know , what i said- - i 'm sorry . no , it 's good to hear the truth for once . - he 's coming . - who ? quick . around the back . here . - hold on to this. wait here . - wait , what are you- - just do it . there is no fix , is there ? jonas is predictable , if nothing else . tell me you love me . i love you . let him go ! stand down , stand down ! sarah , stop . seriously , is that the psychological way of talking me down ? - let jae go . - and you 'll what ? help me ? - where is he ? - gone . jaime , where is he ? you were gonna kill him . i was just doing my job . you kept me completely in the dark . sometimes that 's what the job requires . i refuse to believe that killing an innocent person could ever make things right . yeah , well , that information on the flash drive could save you . what we were doing here was for you . you think because i cost $ 50 million , my life is worth more than his ? oh , we can talk about that later . give him up now . no . no ! stevens is what we call collateral damage . killing him saves you . maybe one day you 'll understand that . you want stevens ... you 're gonna have to get through me . and this time you 'll have to do it without a crowbar . i find this inappropriate workplace behavior . now who 's being inappropriate ? you don 't want to fight me . you know what i 'm capable of . uh-huh , yeah . just because you 're a machine doesn 't mean you can 't be beat . that hurt ? yep . ? she took that pen from the tech . the one with the multi-fractured hands . she figured you 'd never help . the point is moot. she 's gone . so is will 's flash drive . seems jaime and antonio had a misunderstanding . that can be dangerous . hmm , antonio 's doctor can attest to that . so if--if will 's work is gone , then what ? sarah 's gonna die ? i wouldn 't want to be in her shoes . i have never been snowboarding . that seems insane to me now . i can 't believe i 've lived my whole life never having done that . my friends all head up to snow together . usually in february . you should come . oh , you know . can 't plan that far in advance . like to live in the moment , huh ? go for it.see it , want it , take it . never look back at the carnage . exactly . life 's too short . you have no idea . what do you say you and i get out of here ? okay . five years ? listen , five years is a lifetime in technology , jaime , it 's generations . you didn 't think i had a right to know ? yeah , i just didn 't want to tell you . i wanted to protect you from- - no , stop. this is my life . you will not treat me like this . i 'm entitled to know you will not lie to me . - it 's disgusting . - you 're right . you 're right , i 'm sorry . my sister . we will find a way to fix this . jaime , look at me . i will fix this . i 'll fix this . - hey . - hey . how was your trip ? good . yeah , you have fun with carly ? yeah , we hung out. it was cool- - look , are you , like , having an affair with a married man or something ? what ? carly dropped off your shoes . god , you know , i mean , you 're just like dad . you make these big pronouncements , but i can 't even trust a word you say . and you think that i 'm the liar ? look , what is going on , jaime ? just tell me , okay ? i need to know . i deserve to know . i can 't . i love you the most . remember when mom used to say that ? yeah . only she 'd say it so we could both hear . now i love you the most . and i want to tell you everything . but i can 't , i- - trust ... it 's supposed to be a two-way street . yeah , i know , and it sucks . but you have to trust me , becca . my new job is- - it 's complicated . i just ... i need to know that you 're never gonna leave me . i will never leave you . sync : ?

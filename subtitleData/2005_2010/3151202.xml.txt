- i 'ii take a seat . what do you mean , " shut us down " ? they used our network to spread out to the whole world . the blackout 's global . we have no communications , satellite and land lines are dead . y ou mean to tell me that i cannot pick up this telephone and call my family ? mr. secretary ? i 'm here under direct order from the president . y ou really need to see what i have in the case . y ou 'ii have to accept that there are certain things you won 't understand right away . sector seven is a speciai-access division of the government convened in secret under president hoover 80 years ago . y ou may remember nasa jpl lost the beagle 2 mars rover . we told them to report the mission a complete faiiure. it wasn 't . beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds . this was classified above top secret . eda ended at 1 70 hours , 48 minutes . more than just a pile of martian rocks . this is the image from mars . here 's the image your special ops team was able to retrieve from the base attack . we believe they are of the same exoskeietai type , and obviously not russian or north korean . are we talking about an invasion ? we intercepted the message from your special ops team . these things can be hurt by our weapons and now they know it . that 's why the virus shut us down , so we can 't coordinate against their next attack , which i would bet my ridiculous government salary is coming soon . get word to our fleet commanders over the national guard frequency . it 's a shortwave radio channel . it might be still working . tell them to turn their ships around and come home. asap ! and inform all commands to prepare for imminent attack . captain lennox , we need you and your team to come with us right now ! let 's go ! she 's in here . what 's going on ? y ou 're coming with me . - y ou 're going to be my advisor . - me , too ? who 's this ? - he 's my advisor . - he comes , too . - so ... - what 'd they get you for ? i bought a car . turned out to be an alien robot . wow . who knew ? make a hole ! watch your back ! please , let this work . fire it up , optimus . the code . the code on these glasses indicates the all spark is 230 miles from here . i sense the decepticons are getting ready to mobilize . they must know it 's here , as well . what about bumbiebee ? we can 't just leave him to die and become some human experiment ! he 'ii die in vain if we don 't accomplish our mission . bumbiebee is a brave soldier . this is what he would want . why are we fighting to save the humans ? they 're a primitive and violent race . were we so different ? they 're a young species . they have much to learn . but I 've seen goodness in them . freedom is the right of all sentient beings . y ou all know there 's only one way to end this war . we must destroy the cube . if all else fails , i will unite it with the spark in my chest . that 's suicide . the cube is raw power . it could destroy you both . a necessary sacrifice to bring peace to this planet . we cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes . it 's been an honor serving with you all . - autobots , roll out ! - we rolling ! team attention ! present arms ! at ease. captain , sergeant . got your intei. excellent work . thank you , sir . what about the gunships ? they 're being retrofitted with sabot rounds now . if they hit us again , we 'ii be ready for them . but it won 't do us much good if we can 't get world communications back up . hey , kid . i think we got off to a bad start , huh ? y ou must be hungry ? y ou want a latte ? hoho ? double venti macchiato ? where 's my car ? son , i need you to listen to me very carefully . people can die here . we need to know everything you know . we need to know it now . okay . but first , i 'ii take my car , my parents . maybe you should write that down . oh , and her juvie record . that 's got to be gone. like , forever . come with me . we 'ii talk about your car . thank you . the man 's an extortionist . all right , here 's the situation . y ou 've all had direct contact with the nbes . nbes ? non-bioiogicai extraterrestriais . try and keep up with the acronyms . what you 're about to see is totally classified . dear god. what is this ? dear god. what is this ? we think when he made his approach over the north pole , our gravitational field screwed up his telemetry . he crashed in the ice , probably a few thousand years ago . we shipped him here to this facility in 1934 . we call him nbe one . well , sir , i don 't mean to correct you on everything you think you know , but , i mean , that 's megatron . he 's the leader of the decepticons . he 's been in cryostasis since 1935 . y our great-great-grandfather made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of mankind . fact is , you 're looking at the source of the modern age , the microchip , lasers , spaceflight , cars , all reverse-engineered by studying him . nbe one. that 's what we call it . and you didn 't think the united states military might need to know that you 're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement ? until these events , we had no credible threat to national security . well , you got one now . - so why earth ? - it 's the all spark . all spark ? what is that ? well , yeah , they came here looking for some sort of cube-iooking thing . anyway , mr. nbe one here , aka megatron , that 's what they call him , who 's pretty much the harbinger of death , wants to use the cube to transform human technology to take over the universe . that 's their plan . - and you 're sure about that ? - y eah . y ou guys know where it is , don 't you ? follow me . y ou 're about to see our crown jewel . carbon dating puts the cube here around 10,000 bc . the first seven didn 't find it until 1913 . they knew it was alien because of the matching hierogiyphics on the cube as well as nbe one . president hoover had the dam built around it . four football fields thick of concrete . a perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone or any alien species on the outside . wait , back up. y ou said the dam hides the cube 's energy . - what kind exactly ? - good question . please step inside . they have to lock us in . oh , wow . what 's that ? freddy krueger done been up in here or something ? oh , no , man . freddy krueger have four blades , man . that 's only three. that 's wolverine ! - right ? that 's wolverine ! - that 's very funny . anybody have any mechanical devices ? blackberry ? key alarm ? cell phone ? i got a phone . nokias are real nasty . y ou 've got to respect the japanese . they know the way of the samurai . nokia 's from finland . y es , but he 's , you know , a little strange . he 's a little strange . we 're able to take the cube radiation and funnel it into that box . - mean little sucker , huh ? - that thing is freaky ! kind of like the itty-bitty energizer bunny from hell , huh ? he 's breaking the box . go ! go ! go ! move ! gentlemen , they know the cube is here . banachek. what 's going on ? well , the nbe one hangar has lost power ... - what ? - ... and the backup generator - is just not gonna cut it . - do you have an arms room ? megatron ! megatron ! megatron ! i 'ii bring security to the ... get everyone to the nbe one chamber now ! - the lights are out ! - move it ! move it ! let 's go ! they 're popping our generators ! megatron melting ! 16502. we 're losing pressure . stand by ! set ! we 're losing pressure ! the cryogenic system is failing ! we 're losing nbe one ! forty millimeter sabot rounds on that table ! that 's good. get all the ammo you got . everything you can carry. bring it . y ou got to take me to my car . y ou have to take me to my car . he 's gonna know what to do with the cube . - y our car ? it 's confiscated . - then unconfiscate it . we do not know what will happen if we let it near this thing ! - y ou don 't know . - maybe you know , but i don 't know . y ou just wanna sit here and wait and see what happens ? i have people 's lives at stake here , young man . take him to his car ! drop it . whoa ! whoa ! whoa ! drop your weapon , soldier . there 's an alien war going on and you 're gonna shoot me ? y ou know , we didn 't ask to be here . i 'm ordering you under s-seven executive jurisdiction . s-seven don 't exist . right. and we don 't take orders from people that don 't exist . - i 'm gonna count to five. okay . - well , i 'm gonna count to three . - simmons ? - y es , sir ? i 'd do what he says. losing 's really not an option for these guys . all right. okay . hey , you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid 's camaro ? that 's cool . no , no ! stop ! y ou got to stop ! stop ! stop ! stop ! no , no , stop , stop , stop ! let him go ! let him go ! are you okay ?

I have witnessed their capacity for courage . and though we are worlds apart , like us , there 's more to them than meets the eye . I am optimus prime and I send this message to any surviving autobots taking refuge among the stars . we are here . we are waiting . can you shed any light on the recent , so-caiied alien activity in the area ? do you know what ? i think that if there was some sort of an alien - infestation ... - y eah . they , the government , would be the first to let you know . the government would let us know . - i mean , this is america . - y eah . y ou know , that 's how we know we live in a free land , because there 's no secrets . they 'd say , " hey ! duck and cover .

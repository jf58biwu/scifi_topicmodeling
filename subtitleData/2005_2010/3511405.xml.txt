 Access the footage from Wesley . We got to the temple this morning , and sent the unit advisors away right after lunch . Funny the way things work out sometimes . The only reason we found this place is because they were looking for weapons of mass destruction that didn 't exist . God definitely has a master plan . The tomb was undisturbed , but it 'll probably take another couple of days to get to them . Dr. Chandler completed his assignment this morning . He was ready . We all know the sacrifices we have to make . Never seems to get any easier . I miss Moray . This could be a chance to change things forever . Fulton says I 'm crazy , but I wanna get closer . I need to get closer . I stopped Fulton and the others from leaving . They scared them in . It always starts with hallucinations . Then what could happen ? I can 't believe it 's come to this . No one can leave . Get it out , get it out of my head . Who do we send ? I know the perfect person . All my life , I 've been a soldier of fortune . Did what I had to do to get the job done and get my team out alive . This mission shouldn 't have been any different . But it turns out , some things can 't be killed with a bullet . Dr. Cardell is on the ground . I repeat , Dr. Cardell is on the ground . Thunderbird 307 heading back to civilization . Have fun , boys and girls . I could put you out of your misery , rookie . - You ever flown combat before ? - Yeah , a bunch of times . - Videogames don 't count , man . - screw you all . All you all . Elite unit , my ass . - Target practice , Hammer ? - It ain 't loaded , boss . Give me that . All right , listen up . You 've all been briefed about where we 're going . This is Dr. Cardell , she 's here to tell us why we 're going . Meet the Angels . Yoshi , Hicks , this is our medic , sergeant Harrington . - You can call me Doc . - Nickels . - Com tech . - You can call me Nickels . This is our computer specialist , Click . - And the big guy is ... - sergeant Diego Garcia . - I 've been briefed on your unit , Captain . - CIA puke . As you know , the research station at shabaka was hit by a seismic event 36 hours ago . All attempts to reestablish contact since then have failed . And what kind of research are they doing in the middle of the desert ? - The work is classified . - That 's all right , we can keep a secret . It 's an archeological site . Its previous owners used it as a storage facility , but when we acquired it , we found something . something that cannot be moved , something that my superiors say we don 't need to know about . - Yeah , same shit , different day . - What do we get to blow up ? Actually , sergeant , it 's an extraction . This is a fucking joke , right , boss ? With all due respect , honey , but you don 't need this hurricane of pain to dig a bunch of scientists out of the sand . He 's right , Mack , we 're shake and bake , man , not search and rescue . We 're not here to rescue a bunch of scientists . Just one . Who ? King Tut ? Dr. Lee Wesley . Can you pass that around , please ? Nothing else is to be removed from that station . Is that clear , sergeant ? Wouldn 't he have contacted somebody by now if he was still alive ? There is a safe room . But if the quake knocked out their uplink , there 's no way that ... Getting a signal , that would be impossible . Yeah . Anything else we need to know before we get this stupid mother-fucker out on his ass ? - Actually , there is one other thing , sergeant . - Oh , yeah ? What 's that ? That stupid mother-fucker is my father . It 's getting pretty nasty on the horizon . Let 's load up . - I 'm hit . I 'm shot . - Hicks . - Hey , don 't you let him die . - Fuck ! What the fuck happened ? It 's another CIA cluster-fuck , sir . The locals aren 't getting the message . Well , next time remind me to get a translator . - You look like shit . - sorry , boss . - Can you move him ? - I 'm working on it . - Wilcox ? - He 's dead , sir . - You want this ? - Get the fucking thing away from me . Goddamn heathen . Mack ! Buckle up and finish your smokes , ladies ... it 's gonna be a rough one . - What 's the forecast ? - Look for yourself . We gonna be able to find the beacon ? Fortunately , we got a strong signal . Probably wouldn 't be able to see anything in that shit storm . Synch on my mark . Now . Better be ready in six hours , or you 're marching out . This wind will bore in your skin like a blowtorch. so stay tight . - Move out . Go , go , go , go . - Go , go , go . Move it , rookie. soldier up . I got to go , Mack . The wind 's too strong , see you in 6 hours . - Base camp 's been totally blown away . - Stick together and find the hatch . Hooah ? Move out . Eye on the prize , Captain . On my mark . Three , two , one . Clear . Let 's move it . Hustle up . Yoshi , clear the perimeter . Hicks , two-by-two formation . Damn , it 's hot in here . Quit bitching , rook , it can 't be no more than 80 degrees in here . Feels like fucking Cancun to me . - Clear . - Clear . Clear . Down ! - Is he all right ? - Yeah . - Give me some room . - Jeez . - What 's wrong with him ? Is he contagious ? - I don 't know . Hey , you know , I ... I really don 't wanna spend a month in quarantine ... when we hit stateside . He 's not febrile , all right ? If I had to guess , I mean , this looks like ... like radiation poisoning . But I don 't know . Well , I got nothing on the Geiger counter . What is a priest doing here ? Alfeo Jacoby . He 's from The Vatican . - I thought you were a doctor . - My doctorate 's in anthropology . Man , that 's some sick-ass shit , bro . It 's like when Blakeley and I were in the swamp for two days . - Blakeley ? - Our last CO . Yeah , we came out , our whole bodies were covered in two-inch leeches . Feel good , having something that big in your pants , Nickels ? You wanna take a little peek , huh ? Kiss it ? - Mack . - All right , guys , come on . Let Doc work her magic . Didn 't mean to hit on your girlfriend , Doc . - You okay ? - Yes . I mean , no . - Well , which is it ? - Someone 's in the safe room . - Is it Wesley ? - I can 't tell . There 's people wandering around everywhere . And the bad news ? Look , lady , I ain 't got time for bullshit games . If you know something , you need to spill it . Well , the whole base is locked down . We can 't go any further without an override code . Or a really good hacker . - Click . - Yo . Get over here . We need you to get into that network and get the elevator working . I 'm on it . Listen up , we 're going down in 5 . Get your gear in order . - Hey . What 's up ? - Cardell was wrong . The quake didn 't knock out this com system . They got torn to shreds from the inside . How long is it gonna take for you to get it working ? Patch this up , about an hour . There 's no power running to this thing . Could be a blown relay downstairs . Boy got skills , or what ? I can see why The Pentagon didn 't cut you loose ... after you hacked into their database . Oh , yeah , you company men . Know all , see all , hear all . Don 't worry , your secret 's safe with me . Hell of a first step . You 're not gonna piss yourself , are you , Click ? How deep did you say this hole was , Dr. Cardell ? - A thousand feet ? - Just ignore them . Yeah I ... I 'm not worried about them . It 's this . What 's the Gehenna Project ? I don 't know . Yeah , it looks like a bunch of encrypted data files . But they won 't be encrypted for long . Come on , come on , breathe . Breathe , God damn it , breathe . Breathe . Breathe , breathe , come on , Nate , breathe . - You look like shit . - sorry , boss . Mack . We 'll get you out of here , son . - Can you move him ? - I 'm working on it . - We got to pull rank , Captain . - I can 't breathe . I can 't breathe . That 's what happens when you get a chest wound . What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm cleaning out his airways . - That 's disgusting . - Give me that . - Here you go , boss . - You okay ? - I 'm trying to get this guy stable , but his vitals are for shit . - Maybe he 's got allergies or just bad acne . - Would you shut the fuck up ? - Mack , we gotta get him outta here . - Well , can we call the chopper back ? Not in this storm , not without the uplink . May I remind everyone , nothing is to be removed from this station . That includes him . You know what ? That 's bullshit . No , Doctor , that 's a direct order . You know , this is exactly what you said wouldn 't happen . I 'm not leaving him . - Yes , you are . - No , I 'm not . Mack , he 's a priest , okay ? That may not mean anything to you , but it does to me . Well , set Nickels up with what he needs to do and pack your gear . - Him ? - Me ? Cardell 's right . Our orders are no souvenirs , so pack your gear . No , no , no , no , I ... I ain 't touching him . - Yes , you are . - Yes , I am . We 'll plug the power back in downstairs . I want that uplink fixed by the time we 're back . Hooah ? Hooah . It 's like Tal Afar all over again . Asses flapping in the wind . You 're up , Hicks . - Fuck . I want this to go by the book . We get Wesley , we get the hell outta here . - Ready ? - This badass was born ready , boss . Let 's move . I love this shit . - No grab ass , you two . Get in here . - Come on . Dr. Cardell , you reset your transponder . Hicks , rig the rookie , would you ? Happy hunting . Keep your safeties on . Hey , this ain 't so bad . Welcome to hell . You want something for that ? Lock and load . You know , in our line of work , nothing gets you killed quicker than dragging civvies into a hot zone . Especially those wearing panties . stay with us , lady . Earthquake . - Hold it . - Is everyone okay ? What the hell ? This place is coming down on our asses . Where do these leads go ? When Wesley 's team found this place it was booby-trapped . They hauled out enough C-4 to blow it up two times . - Who 's maintaining this place ? - Dr. Wesley 's team . Enough chatter . Hammer , Yoshi , take lead . - Let 's move . - Okay . Stay sharp . How many people did you say were down here ? Twenty scientists , some security personnel . It 's up ahead . What the hell is that ? For God so loved the world ... Over here , boss . What is that ? Who 's that ? Now why would God make such a bad deal ? - Is that Wesley ? - I can 't tell . Identify yourself . We 've been called many things throughout the millennia . - But Wesley isn 't one of them . - Son of a bitch . Where do you turn for the answers you seek , Dr. sarah Harrington ? The Authentic , the Barclay , the Contemporary , the New American , the New English , the New Evangelical , the Revised , the Restored , the Worrell ? Have you ever wondered why there are so many ... if only one truly showed the way ? I 'll bet you have , Doc . We got no time for this shit , Mack . Without the shedding of blood , there can be no remission of sin . Let me help you repent . Doc , get over here . Doc ? Doc , what 's wrong with you ? He knew my ... He knew my name , Mackie . He just said my whole name . Shit . That son of a bitch is spitting battery acid . All right , just hang on . Let me help you . - How 'd he know my name ? - What was he talking about ? - Scripture , Old Testament . Hebrews 9 : 22 . - What does it mean ? It means all her friends has gone loco , that 's what it means , Mack . Shit . Sedate him , Doc . I don 't want this guy wandering around down here . Hey , soldier up . Knock him out , Doc . If we have to , we 'll lock him in the elevator . Okay , now just keep it open , all right ? Captain . I don 't think you got anything to worry about with this guy there , Click . shit . Good thing the bullet didn 't hit the tank , or none of this shit wouldn 't be here anymore . - You 're the only one who can help me . - What ? - Why didn 't you get it outta me , Sarah ? - I 'm sorry . Why did you let me die , you bitch ? I don 't ... You 're the only one who understands . It says , " Welcome to hell " . - You can read that ? - Yeah . I speak a bunch 'a languages . What ? You can 't ? How we doing , Doc ? Sergeant Harrington ? Harrington , do you copy ? Doc ? - Click ! - Yeah ? Get up here . - Where is she , Click ? - shit , I barely have a signal . Find her . Straight ahead a hundred yards . Moving fast . Then so do we . Dr. Cardell , what 's down here ? - Engineering . - Hicks , Yoshi . - Sir . - Sir . Get to communications relay and get the power back on , - So Nickels can get us outta here . - Yes , sir . - Click , you go with them . - Yeah . Don 't forget your gun , rookie . And don 't screw up . - Hammer , take point . - You got it . Nickels , do you copy ? Nickels , do you copy ? Hey , yeah , yeah . Barely , you 're cracking up . How 's the priest doing ? Priest ? The priest is ... No change . Still passed out and creepy . Watch out for him . No , he , he 's not supposed to get tranqued for another 15 minutes . That 's not what I mean . Yeah , but you 're breaking ... You 're breaking up . stay clear of him and get the uplink fixed . Go ... Go again . You 're ... You 're breaking up . Hammer , do you copy ? - Can we move him ? - Yeah . Let 's get him outta here . We gotta pull back , Captain . - Don 't you let him die . - I can 't breathe . That 's what happens when you get a chest wound . Incoming . - Hammer blew the shit outta them fuckers . - Get him up . Keep moving , Dr. Cardell . All right , stay sharp , let 's find that relay and get the hell outta here . Go that way . - Don 't shoot , don 't shoot , don 't shoot . - I will shoot you . Get down here . - What was that ? - I don 't know . Come on . It 's coming from in there . Click , open it . All right . - This is it . - Open it . Fast . You ever stop to think that maybe it 's locked for a reason ? You 're not here for your opinions . Open it . - All right , here we go . - Move . - Here we go . - Move . Yeah , move it . What is that fucking smell ? Oh , fuck . Mack . Mack . - What the hell happened here ? - Keep moving . Who 're they trying to keep out , boss ? Or , who are they trying to keep in ? Cut him down , Hammer . There are those devoid of divinity . Mack , listen . That 's Dr. Wesley . Dr. Cardell . Hospitals cramped with the mentally ill . Those who see clearly the truth . This cosmic game of good cop , bad cop . We all fell for it . It 's a recording . And God looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt . Hammer , it 's me . It 's me . - What 's going on with the power ? - Low-level transformer 's fried . One of the locals grabbed a main bus . Both hands . Was it Wesley ? Have you seen what 299,999 volts does to your complexion ? - Sir , what the fuck 's going on down here ? - Yeah , what she said . And nobody said nothing about crawling through a bunch of dead bodies ... - and barbed wire . - Mack ! - Doc 's signal . It stopped moving . - How far ? Give me that . About 199 feet that way . Storage room . All right , go , go , go . You two , stay here , anybody gets passed us ... - Take them out . - That 's right . Let 's go . Come on . Yeah , something 's getting past him . Right . Way too many rat holes in here . Let 's keep moving . - Click , position . - 20 feet ahead , down the stairwell . You sure you 're reading that thing right ? Yeah , we should see her at the bottom of the stairs . They move about the earth with such ease . Hospitals cramped with the mentally ill . Those who see clearly the truth . What is this bullshit ? - Is it Doc ? - No . No one . We bounce topside and wait for the cavalry . Quiet . - Hey . - Oh , it 's you again . Where 's my soldier ? She 's not your soldier anymore . You blind fools . We offer the same salvation , just without the rule book . - Where 's sarah ? - Come with me . I 'll show you the way . Together we will dine on the afterbirth of her new becoming . - What 's that ? - I don 't know . The coms aren 't working . Mack ? Stay here . Hey , get over here . We did our part , now you do yours . Dr. Wesley ? This cosmic game of good cop , bad cop , we all fell for it . Some of us harder than others . Slaughter one another , and anoint ourselves with ash . Mommy ? We got some C-4 that can help you , Doctor . Just hurry it up . This is Dr. Elissa Cardell , is anyone in there ? Yoshi ? Yoshi ? What the fuck ? Look at your conflict . You try to convince yourselves ... your existence on this ball of dirt ... is not a dead end . Then I ... I show you the truth of your faith ... and you don 't accept it . Make up your mind ! I think you got him . How the hell is this bitch still wiggling ? Nickels . Nickels , do you copy ? Nickels ? Nickels ? I want you to tell me what the hell 's going on . - I don 't know . - Bullshit . - What are they doing down here ? - I told you , I don 't know . I 'm done risking my team for some Agency jerk-off . - This isn 't a CIA project . - But covering up is ? Fuck this . Let 's move . You don 't have the authority to make that call , Captain . I think he just did , lady . You wanna stay ? Be my guest . I have no problem leaving your ass . Some kinda ... biohazard down here that I wasn 't briefed on . It 's not your job to worry about what 's down here . It 's your job ... What the fuck do you know about my job ? My job is to get my team out alive . When I shoot somebody and they don 't die , makes it hard for me to do my fucking job . You can 't ... do this . I told you we 'd get you down here . I didn 't say anything about staying . Captain ! Dr. Cardell . It is you . - Are you alone ? - Yes . Who is this , Doctor ? This is Father Jacob Fulton . He 's part of Wesley 's team . - What 's going on down here ? - He wouldn 't understand . I just saw a dead man quoting chapter and verse . Try me . I want my soldier back . Is my father still alive ? The last time I saw him , he was in the temple . That 's where your friend would have been taken . How did you know she was taken ? How did you know she was taken ? Mommy ? Yoshi . Where are you ? Hi , Mommy . - Hey , baby . - Look what I found , your bear . My mommy gave me that bear on my fifth birthday . My mommy never gave me anything . No bears , no birthdays . Nothing . Except a place in hell ! I asked you a question , Father . How did you know she was taken ? God wiped us out once before . It 's all part of his design . I don 't give a damn what game God wants to play , - I just want my soldier back . - Your soldier is gonna die . We 're all gonna die if we stay here . And you know the way to this temple you spoke of ? - Yes . But ... No ... - Let 's go , come here . - I wanna go back . - Lead the way , Father . Go . - What the hell 're we shooting at ? - What 're we shooting at ? - What 's wrong with you ? - She was here . - Yoshi . - I saw her , I swear to God , Marcus . - Someone talk to me . - It 's Yoshi , she 's seeing things , boss . Hallucinations . It always starts with hallucinations . - What did you see , Yoshi ? - I don 't know . I didn 't see shit , boss . It didn 't just look real , Mack , it felt real . To the temple now . She can 't come with us . They use visions to tempt us . Wesley thought he could contain it . I tried to convince him it 's down here for a reason . I don 't give a damn what you think is down here . You take us to the temple right now ... or I put a bullet through your head right now . Stop ... He 'll take us . All right ? Please . We gotta pull back , Captain . Incoming . Get him up . - Let 's go . - Go ! What the hell happened ? Bad day at the office . We lost Wilcox . Everybody outside . You okay , boss ? Never better . I hate this horror crap . I can 't go , I can 't let it happen . Not to me . You fools don 't understand . All you 're gonna find in the temple is despair . - You 're gonna find despair , old man . - Wait ... I got a better idea . Is this really necessary ? Absolutely . You appeared ... Oh . Wow . Blasphemous . Shit . Hey . Captain , Captain ! - Doc . - Open the door . - I don 't know . - I promise I won 't tell . Look , you need to listen to me , okay ? You can 't trust them . Especially that bitch , Cardell . All right ? I know what 's going on here . It 's not good . I can get us outta here , come on . Open the goddamn door , Click , get me outta here . Captain ... No , get off me . Let me give you your penance . Then you can be beautiful , just like me . Come on . - Come on . - Be right with you , boss . - What the hell was that ? - Nothing like your videogames . Eat this . - What happened ? - Fed Click 's new friend some C-4 . Blew a 599-pound shit bag into next year . The blast caved in the passage . There 's no going back that way . Oh , that 's great . That 's just great . Now what 're we supposed to do ? Man , how could you be so stupid ? Oh , yeah ? I just saved your ass , didn 't I ? And what the hell you were doing back there anyway , huh ? There 's an access tunnel that runs parallel to this corridor . - We can use that . - You heard the lady , Click . - Get the door open . - Yeah , yeah . Okay . That 's gonna have to do . Hicks , get him inside . Yoshi , Hammer , burn anybody that isn 't Doc . Come on . Go . - What about Wesley ? - Fuck Wesley . Where is she ? - You told me my soldier was here . - I told you we had to leave . Mack ! ... Look at this . It 's like a bunch of ancient-fire-and-brimstone shit . There 's stuff here from all over the world , different religions . Hebrew , Christianity , Buddhism . - Click . - Yo . What 's it say ? I can 't read spanish . You can read Latin , but you can 't read spanish ? - Hammer , get in here . - Yes , sir , boss . - What is it , boss ? - What does this say ? Let 's see . It 's a testament from a farmer . He said he saw an angel cast from heaven ... 2000 years ago . What the fuck ? It moved . Mack , it really moved . Look , look , check it out , check it out , check it out . I 'm telling you , it moved . What the fuck is that thing ? Huh ? Doctor Chandler sacrificed himself to stop it from spreading . All right , I wanna get outta here . Yeah , I wanna ... I wanna go . I ... I 'm cold , I 'm hungry , and I 'm tired of you gung-ho mother-fuckers ... pretending you got this shit under control . Quit acting like a little bitch . - He 's right . - What ? It is cold . It 's coming from somewhere over here . Behind this door . - It 's freezing . - Go on . Scream if he moves , rookie . Mommy ? Over here . This way , Mommy . Doc . Where have you been ? Do you believe , Yoshi ? - Do I believe what ? - What you see , what you feel . Sometimes our faith changes who we are . Sometimes who we are changes our faith . What 're you doing ? Come in . Look . - You can see her ? - Of course I see your unborn child . She 's beautiful . I told you it was cold . - What am I looking at ? - The Wrath of God . You might not believe this , Father , but you are expendable . And I 'm about two seconds away ... from expending your brains all over this floor ... if you don 't tell me what the hell that is . - A Nephilim . - A what ? A Nephilim . Go on , Father , tell him where it 's from . Was he down here studying spacemen ? It 's not from space . - Yeah ? What is it , then ? - An angel . Not an angel from heaven , an angel cast from heaven . An angel at war with God . Nephilim are present in almost every religion . In the Bible , the Torah . Even obscure scriptures make reference to them . Genesis speaks of the sons of God ... coming to earth and assuming human form . They corrupted mankind . Ignored the boundaries of their own domain , until God passed his judgment and wiped the slate clean . Started over . Imprisoned them in tombs like this . That 's not ice . It 's the hand of God . That 's why the Adjurists are here . The what ? The Adjurists . A group with one purpose . To find the fallen angels and exorcise their evil . They sacrifice themselves to absorb the nephilim spirit , to make sure that they never escape again . - Like that ? - Exactly . But we were too late . We found dozens of them down here . But not like this one . It 's evil . He 's in Wesley . Why didn 't you tell me any of this before ? You are on the front line of the biggest battle ... mankind has ever fought , Captain . Besides ... would you 've believed me ? Bullshit . - Is this a dream ? - It 's a gift . It 's a chance to make things better . I didn 't have a choice . Not if I wanted to stay with the team . - With Marcus . - With me . Seeing her hurts . I know ... but you don 't have to hurt anymore . You don 't have to hide your pain . Or your desires . What 're you doing ? Why 'd you drag us down here ? Why couldn 't you just bring ... this thing up to the surface and pick it apart up there ? You 're not listening . That 's what they want . To be free from the tomb that God created . The fools never listen . They 'll come to you in ways you can 't imagine , Like a wife , a lover , a child . Child ? Yoshi . Yoshi ? - She 's gone , Mack . - Click . Click . Get Yoshi back here ASAP . Hammer . I know your pain , Yoshi . My sister , she trusted me . The tumor on her spine , it was so small , but I didn 't get it all . And the cancer ate her up from the inside out . I won 't let that happen again . Is this the way out ? - Is this the way out ? - Yes . - What 's on the other side of this door ? - The possessed . Besides the possessed , you simple son of a ... - I have no idea . - How come I don 't believe that ? - Click . - Yeah ? - Get this door open , we 're leaving . - Thank God . What the hell happened ? Bad day at the office . We lost Wilcox . Everybody outside . - How much longer ? - Just another couple 'a seconds . It 's clear ? - So we can go now , man . - Easy . - We leave when I say we leave . - Man , we got to get outta here . Where the fuck is Hammer , you know ? Hammer ! Yoshi . Yoshi . Mary , Mother of God . Hammer . - Hicks , what the fuck 're you doing , man ? - Don 't let him hurt me , Marcus . I know where Yoshi is . She needs you . - She 's one of them . - She 's one of us . Don 't you get it ? This is what the priest said . She 's fucking with your head . Put your weapon down , that 's an order . - I can 't do that . - No ! Doc ? - What are you doing ? - I 'm not checking out ... unless I got proof of what you people are doing down here . Nothing can leave from here . Lady , quit holding him up , okay ? I mean , I 'm not waiting here ... for more of these moaning mother-fuckers to bust in . Fuck . Hammer ... Get her off of me ! Move ! Come on , Click . - Hey , Captain . - What happened ? It 's Hicks . He 's gone completely loco . - He just shot at me . - Why ? I saw Doc , she looked like one of them . It doesn 't look good , boss . - It 's not much better here . - Shit . There 's more fuckers out there , Mack , and they 're probably coming this way . Are you all right ? Look at me . Does it look like I 'm all right ? I mean , this is some shit-covered , marshmallow kind of evil ... that I did not sign on for . - Take a seat , soldier . - I ain 't no fucking soldier , okay ? I mean , I shouldn 't even be here . Click , sit . You know , I got you down here , and I opened up your Gehenna files . You told me I 'd be safe , I don 't feel fucking safe anymore . Oh , God . Oh , God , you did it , didn 't you ? Holy Jesus , now I understand why you 're here . To access Gehenna . Hey , hey , Father ! Hey , Father ! What was he talking about ? Yoshi . - Yoshi . - Marcus . Marcus . - Jesus . - Help me . Come here . I found her . I found our baby , and I held her in my arms . - What ? - She has your smile . Calm down , baby . Everything 's gonna be okay . I 'm here now . - Who did this to you ? - Doc ... she 's helping me . Well , I 'm here now , I 'm gonna take you , okay ? Okay . It 's my back . I ... I don 't know if I can walk . Is it bad ? Sorry , Marcus . Do you want some help with that ? I asked you a question . What was he talking about ? - The explosive rigs by the elevator . - What about them ? Wesley 's team didn 't disarm them . They installed them ... in case something like this happened . - Come again ? - To incinerate everything . - So you pushed a button ? - How long ? Hey , how long ? Twenty-nine minutes , 32 seconds . It 's counting down . I don 't get it , why would you ... Why would you detonate it before the shuttle 's due back ? How 're we supposed to get outta here ? We weren 't . This never was about getting Wesley out , was it ? You were sent here to make sure that he doesn 't . That none of us do . You sick bitch . We should waste you right here , pendeja . Why not blow this place from the surface ? I couldn 't . Wesley changed the code . - Then how did you activate it ? - I didn 't . He did . No , no , no , you did not just say that . I needed a really good hacker to pull the trigger . I didn 't know . I didn 't know . You used us . I did what I had to do . Did what I was told . If anyone should understand that , it 's you . How do we shut it off ? Only from the surface , and only with the code . What 's the code , lady ? Weren 't you guys listening ? Wesley is all 4 Horsemen rolled into one . He hits the surface , what 's happening down here will be happening everywhere , and there will not be any way to stop it . - Give me the code . - Get that thing outta my face . Give me the goddamn code ! It 's not gonna work , she 's not afraid to die . Are you ? I 've been ready for this since I was born . Fuck . My father trained me . So this whole CIA thing was just a cover ? More like a means to an end . You completed your mission before we even got in the elevator . Why still go looking for Wesley ? Shit . So what do we do if we can 't find our way back ? One problem at a time . If anyone can hear this , you got 15 minutes to get the elevator ... before you 're a permanent resident in this hell hole . - Come on , go ! - Let 's move . - Let 's move . - Come on . - Mack , I can 't hold it . - Come on ! Come on ! I can 't hold it . - Come on ! - Come on ! Go ! - You 're a soldier now , man . - Come on , Captain ! It 's an honor , boss . We gotta go , sir . We gotta go ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Come on ! Father , let me help you . Bye , Father . Which way ? Which ... - Don 't tempt me . - This way , Captain , this way . Shit . Eyes on me , Click . We 're almost outta here . Elissa . - Dad . - Shit . What little is left of your father is very sorry to see you here . You look just like your mother . I 'm surprised they sent you . You 're not ready . I thought I was ready . But I was just a child as you are now . What 's happening to him ? Why doesn 't he look like the others ? The nephilim is inside of him . We can 't let him leave , Mack . Why is he still here ? I 'm waiting for you to follow your orders , Mack . My time in this skin suit is almost over . I need for you to bring me a new set of clothes . Yeah , right . Remember what you said when you arrived ? You told your friends , " You find Wesley ... and we get the hell out of here " . Well , you have no idea how right you were . Hey . Nickels . I got your message , man , and I 'm ready to roll . - Don 't you fucking move . - Click , lock and load . Now . Click ! Click ! - Click ! - Captain ! Click . Click , Click , Click ? You look like shit . I never felt better . You know , you and I aren 't that different , really . Both of us bred to do the dirty work of bosses ... who will never truly appreciate our skills . You 'd make a great angel . I am ready . Baby , you 're a very , very naughty girl . - Jesus . - Stop name-dropping , Mack . Well , if you won 't let me in , how about someone you actually care for ? We could try your ex-wife , the one who left you . Or maybe the daughter you never got to see grow up . Or how about someone special , like your best friend ? - How you doing , Mack ? - Blakeley . I heard you ended up with the angels . That 's a pretty good tradeoff . But I got to be honest with you , I 'm not too impressed with your , uh , leadership skills . Pretend to be whoever you wanna be , I know you 're not real . Really ? You 've had a memory of me , of what you did , for the past 5 years . If that don 't make me real , you 're crazy . Mack , do you know the seven deadly sins ? Man 's roadmap to his failures . Guilt isn 't a sin , but in your case maybe it should be . It wasn 't my call . You don 't remember what happened ... Why ? You never did answer that question , Mack . What 're you doing ? - Why did you do it , Mack ? - I did what I was ... told . What a good little soldier . You ever stop to think they might be wrong ? Did you really have to do me in to shut me up ? I did what I was told to do . What makes you think one more would make a difference ? Do you know how many millions have died in these deserts ... in the name of the Father and the son ? . But they couldn 't do it without people like us ... to carry out their plans . People who blindly trust their actions to others . Lie , deceive . I never believed in the Father or the son . You weren 't chosen by chance . We knew you 'd do what you were told . And do it well . You are on the front line ... We can 't let him leave , Mack . Why did you do it , Mack ? All right , maybe I am going crazy . Let me show you the way , Mack . I knew you wouldn 't let me down again . I knew it . - Maybe God does have a plan . - God ? Don 't talk to me about God . He gives you pathetic creatures the gift of choice , and what do you do ? You use it to turn your back on him first chance you get . You chose to take this mission . You chose to kill your best friend . You chose to seek me out . Thank God for free will . Yeah . Thank God . Dad ? - We have to go . Now . - I can 't go . - What have you done ? - What I was trained to do . To free my father 's soul , that was my mission . You have to leave . - I 'm not gonna leave you like this . - You have to leave me like this . You understand . No . But I believe you . For the first time , I know my purpose . My place in the world . I have a new mission , bigger than myself . I 'm a new soldier in a very old war .

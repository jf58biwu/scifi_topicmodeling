A marker which he theorized gave these people certain abilities . - And my brother 's one of them ? - As are you . - I didn 't come here to talk about me . - Fair enough . Peter 's specific dna allows for a blend . Like colors in a mosaic . Resequencing itself to mimic the abilities of those around him . - Like a chameleon ? - More like a sponge . It 's precisely why I 've been studying him . Could his condition become dangerous to himself or to other people ? If he absorbs too much , or comes into contact with an unstable ability , then most definitely yes . Can you fix it ? Alter his genes somehow ? Theoretically , it is possible to develop a specific site inhibitor . But look , I will know more when we find him . We ? Doctor , the last thing my brother needs is somebody feeding into his paranoia . But thank you . Mr. Petrelli . Of all the people on that list your brother may be the most important .

Why did you take that off me ? I 'm dr . Witherson . I 'm a psychiatrist . And I 've been assigned to your case . No , you shouldn 't be in here . It 's not safe . If it makes you feel more comfortable , we can put the restraints back on while we talk . You don 't understand . The drugs keep her weak . That jacket can 't stop her . - Give me a shot . - You mean jessica ? How do you know her name ? I read your file . I know all about your past . Your marriage . Your website . Your sister .

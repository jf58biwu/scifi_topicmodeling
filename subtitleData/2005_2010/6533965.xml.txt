We are right across the street from the White House and the hotel stand off continues . Unfortunately , with no new reports from authorities who still decline to identify the hostages ... Keep the reporters back before I instruct my men to shoot them . Is she still alive ? They have her on the phone with a negotiator . - She 's relaying demands . - The other hostages ? She 's the only one . They cleared everybody else out . I moved them to the basement when the press came . Good . What about our men ? According to one of the waiters , they 're all dead . - Get the SWAT team ready . - Okay . The executive dining room main door is on the second floor landing . I want every exit covered . Every window , every door . Done , sir . Your associate , Mr. Mandela , gave the orders . - Mandela ? - Yes , sir . - Oh , fuck . - Hold on a minute . - Darryl boy , have a seat . - Mr. Mandela ? - That was a funny bit , huh ? - Yeah , real funny . - What are you doing here , Brooks ? - I was just in the neighbourhood . Thought you could use some help . You have really overstepped your bounds this time . Your team doesn 't belong here . In fact , if I had anything to say about it , your team wouldn 't belong anywhere . It wouldn 't exist . Now , get your crazy bunch of lunatics out of my- - He 's made it into the basement . Where now ? - To the left , above the garbage can . - You hear that ? Copy that . - I 'm sorry , you were saying ? - Who is this ? Darryl , this is Carlos . Carlos is a waiter . He knows the ins and outs of the banquet hall kitchen . Carlos , this is Darryl Greene . He 's head of the Secret Service . He 's in charge of all of those dead agents inside . - Dining room door , now . - I wouldn 't storm the door , Darryl . Move , move , move ! The bad guys say they put explosives at all the entrances and exits . You two , take the left . You , come with me , now . Bullshit . They 'd kill themselves . Good point . Good point . But if you 're wrong well , one , you 're just gonna kill more of your men which I know you don 't give a flying fuck about . But two you are gonna guarantee one hell of a funeral down Pennsylvania Avenue . Now , I , for one , would not want to be the head cowboy in charge that went and blowed up the president 's wife . - Entering basement . - Okay , I got you . My team 's ready . - Who 's on your team ? - Just Connors . - Jesus Christ . - No , he wasn 't available . You 're fucking team is a disaster , Brooks . You make more problems than you solve . I 'm waiting . You fuck this up , I 'll really have your ass . Ten minutes , you smug bastard . That 's it . - You 're up , partner . - See you in a few minutes , Billy . We have a 10-point emergency action plan for America . They want to broadcast . They 've sent this by e-mail to all the major networks and cable outlets . Their manifesto must be read live tonight on the evening news . Bobby . The money must be transferred to this bank account . - Dinner , what 's taking so long ? - I 'll go check on it . - -NCC-202 . - The password is " protagonist . " - Bobby ? - That 's right . Protagonist . - Champagne . - They expect confirmation in one hour . - And make it a good one . Let 's go , people , let 's go . Hurry up . How 's it going , Wolfgang ? Hurry up . Let 's move ! This looks tasty . Tasty . Tasty . Hurry up . Let 's move , people ! You . Champagne ? It 's at the entrance . - This a good one ? - I 'm a Henny man myself . You stay here . I 'll take that . Hey . Where 'd you come from ? At the door . He just told me to bring out the food . I don 't want no problems . Gentlemen . Come . If it wasn 't for the unfortunate interference of your Secret Service you 'd be safely home by now , Barbara . I expect we 'll be here a few more hours and we did interrupt before dinner was served . Chicken or fish ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Is it too presumptuous of me to call the first lady by her first name ? I don 't know how you think you could ever get away with this . I don 't expect to get away . I expect to be heard . This operation is about making a statement . One we 're all prepared to die for . You see , some people have principles , unlike the gang of trash that currently holds the reigns of power in this city . Champagne ? While your husband and the rest of the government fiddles this country is burning . Someone has to put out the flames . The Army of Patriots will . Well , give me the damn bottle . This does not bode well for your tip , my friend . - Move , move ! - Greene . Get down ! There ! - Greene . - Keep him off my ass . Greene . Drop your fucking weapons , or I 'll slit Barbara 's throat . Drop them ! - Enemy neutralized . Stand down . - Stop ! - No ! Do not enter ! - Fuck . Do not open the door ! No ! No ! Yeah . Fuck . I 'm coming ! Yeah , yeah . What ? - What do you want , Howard ? - How do you always know it 's me ? Because I can smell your skanky-ass breath . What time is it ? Around 5 . - Which 5 ? - The one before Jeopardy ! Listen , Debbie 's going out for groceries . You need ... - ... any of these cigars you smoke ? - Yeah , and a six-pack . Hey , later on , having a little barbecue . You know , a piece of salmon , a little tofu a little Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young . I know you 're not a sociable guy , but maybe you- - - Here . - No , I 'll get this one , eh . Look , I don 't need your charity , you fucking gimp . - Just take the money . - You don 't need charity , Connors . - You need a fucking psychiatrist . - Fuck you , cracker . - Fuck you , homeboy . - Eat shit . That 's very mature . Give me the money . Give me the goddamn money . I 'll get the cigars . - Now you want the money . - Yeah . - You want any fruit or anything ? - No , just go . Go . Thank you , Johnny . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . Yes , it 's easy money . Charlie Lincoln and I are here to give away money . I 've got a wonderful- - Roberto Tomas , quite a fight but sonic Tangler laying back . There 's a left hook right now , followed by a right jab in there . Tangler 's starting to put a little pressure now on Tomas . A right , another left , a fury of fighting- - - Hit hard , hit hard . - This is starting to look incredible . I- - G stocks extended their gain Wednesday amid positive views on the sector from Wall street . Are you excited about the new room ? Yeah . Where is it ? Marco . Polo . Still walking around jingling that change in your pocket . Fucking loser . Yeah , I gotta know it 's there . So , what 's popping ? Yeah , partner . Just chilling on the back of your pimping houseboat on a weekday , huh ? You know me , it is what it is . Fresh air , sea breeze . I 'll bet you get a hell of a view once the fog lifts , huh ? Blind man with a view . You got jokes . What is you doing out on the coast anyway ? I thought you hate the water . I came to see you , asshole . Your cell phone 's terminated . You won 't answer my damn letters . What do you expect from me ? I 'm a busy man . You know , with all this chilling and all . How long has it been ? How long ? About a long two years , huh ? So how 's business ? The fact is , that 's why I 'm here . I got a gig for you . The president 's chauffeur . Holler at your boy . When do I start ? Come on , man . This is a good gig . This will get you right back up in the loop . Look here , Billy man , don 't come down here playing with me like that . I swear on everything I 'll break your legs and throw you in that fucking bay . Same old Warren Connors , huh ? Same old little punk-ass , East St. Louis crackhead . Sitting in the brig , all fierce and mean . But I could see then and there , all your potential . You remember what I said ? You remember I told you you got a choice ? I said , you could fuck up your life . Go back to the projects . Go to jail . Maybe take a bullet and die in some rat-infested , nasty-ass prison hospital . Or you could come and work with me and be somebody . Do something for your country . " Do something for your country . " Is that what we were doing , Billy ? You damn straight . Gotta wonder about that one . Damn , partner sound to me like you 've been doing some heavy thinking since you 've been chilling . Soldiers don 't ask questions . They just do or die . They do or die because they believe in something . Not that bullshit , flag-waving , Chinese proverb shit . Come on , man . Well , don 't do it for me . Do it for yourself . You believe in that , don 't you ? Come on , man . I gotta have you back . And you could use a gig . Even if I wanted to do it do you see what you looking at ? I 'm blind as a bat , dogs . Well , what if I was to tell you if you come with me , right now I have a way of getting your eyesight back . All of it . Still wanna throw me in the bay ? Yeah . About a month ago I was called into the West Wing . The old man gave me six months . They 're closing down my unit . - Darryl Greene ? - Who else ? Motherfucker . He finally convinced the president I was too much of a loose cannon for their post-Cold War , " we 're the good guys " paradigm . Got this drone satellite . Damn thing can track , pinpoint and destroy a fly from a thousand miles in space . They think they don 't need human beings anymore . Guess I feel sorry for you , O.G. Then don 't be . Because tonight you will sneak into the Mountain and steal the brain to their little toy . I 'm gonna do what ? Just for a day , okay ? One 24-hour period , then I 'm gonna bring it back to the president myself . He gonna see right then and there why you can 't replace old Brooks . Jesus Christ , Billy , how am I supposed to- - ? Dude , you 're stealing their security computer , and tonight you 're gonna have your sight back . And that asshole who fucked over you and me that son of a bitch is gonna be pushing papers in some desk job in Uzbekistan , because it 's payback time for Greenie , I 'm telling you . You remember The Art of War , chapter two ? Turn the first defeat ... - ... into the final victory . - Into the final victory . Where are we ? Old farmhouse about a half-hour east of the mountain . Oh , we way under radar , huh ? Yeah , but we 'll be all right . You got it ? You good ? Watch your step , son you got about just a few left . Three , two- - Just a few more . - Three , two- - One more . - Here we are . - Okay , you 're up . Doc . - Hi . Lead the man- - Get comfortable in the chair , please . All right . Now , watch yourself . There 's a chair right there . Hold that . We 're moving an instrument in front of you now . This is Dr. Lucas Mackenzie . He 's been in micro-ocular surgery and medicine for over 50 years and he knows what he 's doing , okay ? He 's gonna take a look at your eyes . - Mighty soft hands , doc . - That 's his colleague . Hello , colleague . Mr. Connors . Easy , partner . Just wanted to get to know how she looked . - Nothing personal . - So , what 's the story , doc ? Exactly as his file reads . The retina is fused to the inner lining of the ganglion nerve . - And as- - - English , doc , please ? Your subject should work perfectly . All right . Did you hear that ? Now , do you wanna get your sight back , partner ? Because if you do , you gotta make a decision right now . No , I ain 't scared of nothing . - Fuck it . Let 's do it . - My man . Okay , doc , let 's rock . If you don 't mind me asking , doc , what 's the deal ? Ms. Halden , can you explain about the tapetum ? Mr. Connors , do you know why some animals like rabbits ... - ... see differently than humans ? - Got me . Because they have what 's called tapetum . Which is kind of like a mirror that lies behind the retina . It amplifies all the available light . It 's what makes their eyes glow when we shine a light on them in the dark . Now , Dr. Mackenzie here has developed a synthetic tapetum which we 're going to inject directly into your eyes . The military was interested in this for night vision . But someone with normal eyesight can 't absorb the serum . Their body just rejects it . So the subject has to be someone with a non-functioning ocular system . Oh , let me guess , so I 'm the lucky guinea pig . Well , not exactly . There were Larry , Curly and Moe . Three blind mice . Not anymore . Okay , this is going to numb your eyes so you don 't feel a thing . This is a mechanical syringe . It injects the serum directly into your eyes . We call it the pitchfork . That 's very comforting , doc . Are you ready , Mr. Connors ? We gotta go , partner . Let 's go . Both eyes lined up and ready to go . Let 's do the damn thing . Done . Done ? - Doc , I can 't see shit . - Well , it takes some time for the anaesthetic to wear off and the artificial tapetum to integrate itself . We can 't wait around here for that . We gotta get out of here . - If you say so . - All right . At 5 , the Mountain 's getting an upgrade to its power grid . The whole place will temporarily go offline and on to the backup system . So I take out the backup and all the lights go out . That 's right . The electrical is on I-Level . Now , dig it . The drone brain is on G-Level . Now , I know you don 't have clearance for that , but you got moves . It 's in locker number 605 and it 's kept on ice . All right ? Oh , yeah , it 's getting to be about that time , partner . Let 's see if this partnership is still on track . Look , I don 't care about your little war with Darryl Greene . I get my vision back this one job and I 'm done . Deal . Oh , you gonna do the honours yourself ? Well ? - Oh , my God . - What ? I forgot how ugly you were . Okay , now , dig it . You 'll use the Jeep to enter . And I 'll meet you back outside the gate . All right ? Now , I got your ID , I got a change of clothes I got your 9 mm . I 'm not gonna need that . I 'm not killing nobody over no damn laptop . Now , don 't go pussy on me , partner . These dudes don 't play . They ain 't gonna invite you for tea if they catch your ass . I know the drill . I 'm on my own . All right . Well , you got your assorted break-and-enter equipment and the star scope goggles . Which will give you a double advantage in the dark . What ? What 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? Oh , shit . What 's wrong , damn it ? Billy , I ain 't gonna need those goggles . Main gate , we have a car approaching . Check it out . All right , sir . Go ahead . Yes , hold on , I 'll transfer you . We 're at the one-and-a-half-hour mark , sir . Thank you , major . G-Section , authorized personnel only . Can I see your badge , sir ? All right . - You all right there , buddy ? - Yeah , yeah . It 's just these new contacts is killing me . You know , my wife got that laser surgery . She swears by it . Oh , all right . Yeah , I 'll keep that in mind . Thanks . Oh , shit . No . Not fucking now . All personnel review final procedures for power grid upgrade . All personnel review final procedures for power grid upgrade . Two hours to upgrade procedure . It is now two hours to upgrade procedure . Oil refineries in the bottom- - Enter . Yeah ? Grid goes off-line in 15 , sir . - Backup systems checked ? - Yes , sir . Carry on , major . As I was saying , the oil refineries in the bottom left would be our primary target . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . Get on the radio . Why aren 't the backup systems kicking in ? Sergeant , we need someone down at I-Level immediately . Here you go , general . All levels report to command centre . All levels report to command centre . Check for power failure at I-Levels .

All personnel , we have a code red . Commence shutdown procedure . We have a code red . All personnel , we have a code red . Commence shutdown procedure . We have a code red . Hold on ! - You talking to me ? - Yes , sir . We got orders to close down the base . You 'll have to go back . - I 'm sorry , sir . - Me too . That 's him ! Over there ! The guy in the car ! Halt ! Halt , or we fire ! And fire ! Oh , shit ! We 're going in for a closer look . We 're approaching the vehicle now . Doesn 't seem to be anybody inside . Nope , nobody 's inside the vehicle . - Marco ? - Oh , fuck you . Yeah , but you got it , didn 't you ? Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck ! Hold still , Mr. Connors . What the fuck did y 'all give me , man ? My head feels like it 's exploding . Seems to be an adverse reaction to the tapetum . There 's always the possibility of side effects . Side effects ? What the fuck you telling me about side effects now ? Oh , stop whining , Connors . You wanted to see . - So you got a little headache . - Fuck you , too , Brooks . Hold on , Mr. Connors . We 're going to extract the serum . That should relieve the pain . Amanda ? Mr. Connors , sit back . Try and relax , all right ? The extraction process is more complicated so we 're gonna give you a general anaesthetic and knock you out . Oh , yeah . Just take this pain away . Ten , nine eight , seven six , five , four ... Ms. Halden ? How did you know it was me ? I don 't wear cheap perfume . I guess you 're feeling better . Yeah . I 'm all right . - What time is it ? - It 's about 1 : 00 . Which 1 ? The one around lunch , which is what I 'm trying to fix . But it 's quite the challenge in this kitchen . How did we get here ? Brooks dropped us off about three hours ago . I told him I 'd stay till the anaesthesia wore off . - Headache 's gone ? - Pretty much . - Mind if I take a look ? - Be my guest . How long before headaches started ? About five , six hours . Then , like , my vision kept going in and out . - How well could you see before that ? - Look that serum didn 't just enhance my vision , it magnified it . Colours got deeper . Lights got sharper . I could see in pitch black . I could spot a golf ball from a mile away and tell you the brand . - So the serum worked . - Damn straight , it worked . Only thing is your guinea pig can 't see shit in light and my head felt like it was about to explode or something . Look , we 'll work on the headaches . Okay ? I don 't think there 's anything we can do about your sensitivity to the light . The infrared rays from the sun just aren 't synthesizing with the serum . Put your head back . Maybe there 's some kind of headgear or something we can develop to diminish the intensity . Say word . Like I get some type of cape , fancy car with it too ? I bet you would just love a theme song , wouldn 't you ? See ? Oh , wait . I know I just didn 't detect a little sense of humour . I know Ms. Halden didn 't just come up with a little funny or something . It 's been known to happen . You know what ? I bet those cute brown eyes get even sexier and nicer when you smile . How do you know I have brown eyes ? Snuck a peek after you drugged me and took advantage of me . Mr. Connors , I wouldn 't need any anaesthesia to knock you out again . You 're supposed to be a healer , not a fighter . You 're supposed to comfort me . What about that doctor-patient relationship ? Isn 't there some oath to go with that ? I had a life before medical school , Mr. Connors . On the South Side of Chicago the sisters got their own oath . - You want a piece of that ? - Chi-town . I don 't want no drama . Hell , no . Saved by the bell . Let me get up until something pop off . Howard , Howard , Howard . How did you know it was me this time ? I brushed , I flo- - - What ? - Well . - Well , what ? - Well , well , well . Does the Conster have himself some female companionship today ? - Howard , could you haul ass ? - Hey , no judgment . Free love . That 's what it was all about in my day . You 're a pathetic , dirty old man , you know ? Yeah , listen . My TV is on the fritz and I just rented Yellow submarine . What 's that have to do with me ? Oh , well , I thought I could borrow yours . It 's not like you 're watching it or anything right now . Okay , okay . Later , later . Not now . Yeah , later , later . Just give me a call when it 's free and clear down here at the love shack . You know , you 're a piece of work , Howard . - So how do you like your eggs ? - Sunny-side up . Too late . How about scrambled ? Oh , damn . You know , Dr. Mackenzie wanted me to apologize . We should have let you know there could be side effects to the serum . Forget about it . I mean , it is what it is . Actually , it was pretty shitty . But sometimes we get so close to the project we forget that we 're actually dealing with real people . Look , if you hadn 't been so caught up on your work I 'd never have the opportunity to have my sight back . You don 't know how much that means . Well , we 're gonna learn how to do it better and without side effects . That is , if you 're willing to continue ... You know , continue to be ... Being your guinea pig ? - Yeah , basically . - I ain 't got nothing to lose , baby . I 'm a rider . Good . Now all we have to do is secure the funding . What about Brooks ? - Our work with Brooks is done . - Done ? - Yeah . - Don 't you work for the agency ? No . When the new administration came in , they cut us loose . We tried to hustle some money from private investors but we had no takers . Until Brooks came along . He knew our work , secured the funding , and brought us in for this job . And maybe , if your mission was a success last night you can actually convince him to continue funding the project . Well , we should know pretty soon . Brooks should be handing the brain to the president as we speak . - Brain ? - Yeah . See our little mission last night was basically to save Brooks ' project . We sort of kind of borrowed this hard drive . Funny piece of equipment for a hard drive . - You saw it ? - Yeah . While I diffused serum in your head , Brooks took it out of the bag . It looked more like a thermos than a hard drive . - A thermos ? - Yeah . It was about that big and stainless steel . What ? - What ? - Peek outside . - Peek outside ? - Peek outside . All right . - I 'm peeking outside . - What do you see ? " What do I see ? " I see a houseboat . I see a guy in a boat kind of throwing some water out with a bucket . No , no , no . Over by the bridge . - What do you see ? - Nothing . There 's two guys on the bridge . Two- - ? What they got on ? - What do you mean ? - What are they wearing ? Dark glasses , dark suits . Those are Greene 's men . Get away from that window . Wait a minute . What 's going on ? I think something 's gone wrong . Those are agency men . They 're staking out the place . - We got five minutes , if that long . - Five minutes for what ? - What the hell is that ? - This is my bodyguard . Let 's go . I 'm not going until you explain to me what 's going on . We don 't have time for that . Let 's go . Mr. Connors , you are blind you got God knows what arsenal in your crotch and you want me to lead you around ? I deserve answers . Look , Amanda , you gotta trust me right now . Those men are here to kill us . They got a hit on us . Let 's go . Okay . Go around . Howard , I need a favour . Your ride . - What ? - Give me the damn keys ! Yeah . I always knew there was more to you than just a blind dude with a rotten attitude . Here . Federal agents ! Come out ! Hey , Connors ! You be careful with her . She 's a classic . Get down . Jesus Christ . Yes , Mr. President ? - Mr. President ? - Guess again , Greene . Connors . Don 't say nothing . I got a couple of things I need to know . That was some stunt you and Brooks pulled . - Tell me , how does a blind man- - ? - Look , don 't say nothing . I 'm asking the questions . Does Brooks still work for the agency ? Like you don 't fucking know . Jesus Christ , you don 't know . When the new administration came in , Brooks ' department wasn 't necessary . We fired him about six months ago . What did you think ? You didn 't work for the U.S. Government you worked for Brooks , private citizen . Now he 's in D.C. trying to blackmail us with the shit you stole . - Is the thermos what I think it is ? - Why should I tell you anything ? Because I 'm the best chance of you getting it back . Is the thermos CMC-12 ? Yes . I 'm telling you , Connors , your man 's nuts . He went crazy when we fired him . All kinds of threats , accusations . What did you think was gonna happen ? That job was his whole fucking life . Well , now his whole life is all fucked up . The man is a criminal , he 's dangerous . He has a vendetta against me and the whole country and you 've helped him . No , no , no . He wouldn 't do nothing like that . Nothing . Unless ... You were taking him out ? You got an executive order , didn 't you ? Fuck you . Assassinations are against the law in this country- - Wait . What did he threaten , to go to the press ? To release all y 'all dirty laundry to get his job back ? No . You wouldn 't go for that . You went to the president and got an executive order ? You 're in deep shit , Connors . You 'd better turn yourself in and- - - Where are we headed ? - Back to the farm ... - ... so you can reinject me with serum . - Reinject you ? Wait , wait a minute . This vehicle . Is it marked ? What do you mean , " Is it marked ? " Any distinctive characteristics that will get us spotted ? Well , yeah . There 's a few . All right , we 're gonna have to ditch this thing . We need another ride . My car 's still back at the farm . Are you gonna tell me what 's going on ? Yeah . Brooks lied to us , that 's what 's going on . - He ain 't the cat we thought he was . - Well , who is he then ? Good fucking question . See , he 's an agency man . He was brought in during Vietnam . See , he put together this team , this special team that only answered to the president . Brooks was my mentor . Brought us all in from nothing . Taught us how to fight . Taught us about loyalty and honour . Made us believe we was finally doing something right in our fucked-up lives . What a joke . Then there was this operation called London Fog . It was a nasty little gig during Desert storm headed by our old friend , Mr. Darryl Greene . That was back when he worked for the CIA . See , the agency had developed this little nerve gas they called CMC-12 . A thousand times more deadly than sarin . And during the end of the war the entire Iraq army- - They was hauling ass out of Kuwait . You know what Greene wants to do ? He decides to have a little field test on the CMC-12 . - What ? - Yeah before there was any chance of talks for a cease-fire or anything like that . So we dropped a container . - What ? - Took out an army platoon . But also killed every man , woman and child within a mile radius . Jesus . And the thermos ? Thermos ? It got ten times the CMC-12 than what was dropped in Iraq . Oh , my God . What do you think he 's gonna do with it ? Who the fuck knows ? But I 'll tell you one thing , mama . If we don 't find him , we can kiss all our asses goodbye . Barnes . Brooks called . He wants $ 22 million and safe passage to a neutral country or he 'll set off CMC-12 in the middle of the city . Fuck . Okay , I will ... I will notify the president and get him to a safe location . That is exactly what we 're not going to do . We keep this all in-house . Let 's not panic . Okay . You know Brooks better than I do , but I don 't understand . Why 22 million , and why CMC-12 ? In a warped way it makes perfect sense . This is Billy Brooks ' big " fuck you " to me and the government . His annual operating budget was 22 mil . CMC-12 was my project . It 's a project that 's not supposed to exist . What matters now is we get the CMC-12 back and buried . We 'll play his game and then we 'll take down Brooks before this gets out . - What 's wrong ? - The door 's open . It 's never open . Know what ? Go park this somewhere where it 's out of sight . Oh , my God . Dr. Mackenzie ? - He 's dead . - Bullet to the base of the skull ? - Bullet to the base of the skull ? - Yes ! - Who would do this ? - Brooks . - Why ? - Look , look . You have to keep it together for me . You have to reinject me so we can get out . - Cleaners are on the way . - The cleaners ? A team of Brooks ' men . They 're gonna dispose of everything . - Probably burn this to the ground . - Okay . Watch your head . Now , look . We 've only got one more vile left , and ... And you gotta remember that you 've only got about five or six hours until the serum starts causing headaches . Yeah , and I won 't see nothing in light , I know . Come on . Let 's go . Let 's go . Oh , God . - I don 't know how to tell you this . - What ? - We don 't have any more anaesthetic . - Of course not . Let 's go . - I can 't do this . - You 're gonna have to . - No , I can 't do this . - You have to or we dead . Just do it . All right . Here . Put your chin up . Yeah . Okay , I think ... All right . I 'm in . I 've never actually- - But okay . Oh , my God . All right . - Are you ready ? - Ready . On the count of three . Ready ? One , two- - - Sorry . I 'm sorry . - Shit ! I 'm sorry . - Are you okay ? - What happened to counting to three ? - I didn 't want you to twitch . - The nigga twitching , ain 't he ? - Okay . - Goddamn it . All right . Something is just not making sense to me . I mean ... - Here . - No ! Stop . I don 't need that right now . Stop . How much did it cost Brooks to get this operation together ? Millions . Brooks don 't need to take nothing from the government . Over the years we took our stash , and we ain 't worrying for nothing . This ain 't about no goddamn money . This about getting even . Even with Darryl , the president , the whole fucking country . What are you talking about ? What ? What ? - What is it ? - The cleaners is here . - Take it . - I 'm not gonna take that . - Take it . - I 've never fired a gun in my life . Look . This is gonna be your initiation , then . You gonna have to not let your South Side girls down right now . Because some gangster shit is about to pop off in here . Oh , God . What do you see ? Three guys getting out of a van . - Find somewhere to hide . - What ? Anywhere . Anywhere . Go . There 's nothing in here . - Quick , quick , quick . - Where , though ? God . God . Work 's upstairs . Hey , hey . Don 't shoot . It 's me . It 's me . All right , Chi-town . Come on . - Yeah . - Mean Darryl Greene , everybody . Let 's get on with this , okay , Brooks ? For chrissake . Oh , Darryl , jeez , you gotta lighten up . You 've always been so fucking high-strung . Gotta take all the fun out of life walking around with a big stick up your ass . - Can we move on ? - Yes , we can . But , Darryl , tell Barnes to turn off the recorder . I know I 'm getting old but give me some credit . There ain 't no way you can trace me . - You got my money ? - Yeah . Good . Okay , here 's the deal . I got my guys . You got yours . Now , we can make this clean or we can make this bloody . Very bloody , and very fucking loud . - I 'm listening . - Two cars . Barnes drops off the money . You pick up the package . Easy , simple , quiet . - Where and when ? - In one hour be in your cars outside your office . I 've got your numbers . Darryl any sign of backup and the deal 's off . There 's not gonna be any backup , Brooks . You know I want this as quiet as you do . You 've been very clever , I must say . I 'll take that as a supreme compliment coming from you , Mr. Greene . Why are we stopping ? - Get out . - What do you mean , get out ? Get out . I 'm going to D.C. You 're going to that gas station and hitching a ride back to wherever you came from . No , I am not . - And give me the gun . - No . - What do you mean , no ? - I mean , no . I 'm sticking with you . The way I look at it in about two hours you 're gonna be howling in pain and you know what else ? You 're gonna be blind as a bat . You are gonna need me . And beside that I 'm getting pretty good with this thing . You 're beginning to worry me . Just drive . - Yeah ? - You both in your cars ? - Yes . - Yes . All right , Barnes , you hold tight . My man will come to you . Greenie , start up your crate . Leave your office , onto First . Shouldn 't we warn the authorities ? And tell them what ? There 's a weapon of mass destruction somewhere in the D.C. area ? " And who are you , sir ? " Oh , I 'm just a blind , undercover ex-agent rolling with a gun-toting optometrist . I get your point . So how do you know where Brooks is ? If Brooks wanna threaten , he 'll threaten where it hurt . - The president . - He 's at the White House ? Not exactly . See , Brooks quoted The Art of War , chapter two . That 's his bible . It 's an ancient Chinese book on battle tactics . It 's kind of just stating that the first defeat could be the final victory . You know , symmetry . Okay , so where is this symmetry gonna take us ? I 'm just crossing onto Maryland Avenue now . Now keep going , you 're almost there . Turn that corner and what do you see ? I see the White House . Yeah . Now look across the street . What do you see ? Fun idea , huh ? The first defeat can be the final victory . - Barnes , you still with me ? - Yeah . He 's here . Let him in , bring him to me . Darryl , that you ? What are you drinking ? Cut the shit . Let 's do this . You 've never had any style , Greenie . That 's always been your big problem . Relax . You 're the guest of honour . Have a seat . Darryl have a seat . Your boys need more training . Will you please stop showing off and sit down ? Please ? - Barnes , you there ? - Yeah . Where 's Greene ? He 's right here with me . Don 't worry . We 're gonna start our little transaction . See my man walking towards you ? - Yeah . - That 's the drop . Give it to him . Barnes ? Barnes , give it to him . It 's okay , Barnes . I 'm sorry about this , Darryl . I really am . You weren 't on the ground in ' 91 to see what your little concoction does . Sure wasn 't pretty . Now let me see . How does this thing work again ? Let me see . Now , I believe all I have to do is push this button the protective seal cracks causing the cooling liquid nitrogen inside to escape and then , my friend , there 's no going back . You can 't disarm it . In about five minutes it becomes unstable , explodes and a totally invisible toxic cloud could engulf you and waft through every nook and cranny of this hotel cross Pennsylvania Avenue into the White House and two of my favourite people will be in heaven . And along with them their little , secret executive order to eliminate one Billy Brooks . Excuse me . Do you have a William Brooks here ? Brooks . B-R-O-O-K-S . Brooks , William . - No , sorry . - Greene ? - Darryl Greene . - Yeah , Darryl Greene . G-R-E-E-N- ls there an E on the end of that ? - Yeah . You mean the Darryl Greene retirement party ? - Yes , that 's it . - Yeah . - It 's private . - Well , where- - ? - Where is it at ? - Where is it ? I can 't tell you that . That 's against hotel policy . Just give it to him . I wouldn 't mess with her , homey . It 's the executive dining room . That 's what 's up . Bonnie ... - Sorry . - That 's as far as you go , okay ? - What ? - I need you here , right here . No , but I- - Him ? You gotta be out of your mind . There 's nowhere on earth you 'll be able to hide . You see , that 's the thing . See , I won 't have to . Because thanks to you , nobody knows about this . So later on , when they investigate and find that you shot yourself with your own gun they 'll find this ... suicide note- - Very adroitly forged . - -explaining everything . How you were so terribly distraught and guilty about your misdeeds . How you blamed the government and how this was your own personal deranged plan to set the whole thing straight . You 're the deranged one , Brooks . And the rest of you you gonna go along with this sick fuck ? I taught my men you gotta be a little nuts in this business to survive . You won 't just kill me and the president . You 'll kill everyone within five miles . Collateral damage . You didn 't seem to mind in Iraq . This is America , damn it , the people you 're paid to protect . You fired me , you fuck ! I 'm off the payroll , Darryl . For good . So fuck you . Do it . Connors . Connors ? That you , partner ? Put down the canister and drop your guns . What did you do ? Put some more of that crap in your eyes ? I told you about trying to be a hero . That is not the way the game is played , my brother . You know you played me out , right ? Hell , I had to . I needed you . I could tell that the layoff had affected you , and well , it- - Oh , fuck . I 'm gonna tell you the truth . I knew damn well you wouldn 't do the gig . That 's the first thing that came out your mouth that wasn 't a fucking lie . What the hell ? That 's him ! - Get him , he 's unarmed . - Careful , behind there . - Behind there , go . - There he is , there he is ! He 's got my gun . - There , in the corner ! - Not me , damn it . You son of a bitch ! Brooks ! He 's out the door . Connors , get him ! Kill the bastard . Shut your ass up . Brooks . Brooks ! Drop the gun . Drop it ! Drop it , drop it . And the bomb . Step away . Can 't we talk this out , partner ? I mean , you 're forgetting I let you go . Even left you that pretty bitch to help you out . Now , if I wanted to kill you I would have done it right then and there . That 's the only reason you ain 't got a bullet in your ass right now . See , you ain 't nothing but a common murderer . Stone-cold killer , huh ? You killed Dr. Mackenzie and his assistant for what ? It had to be done . You know how it works , you gotta tie up the loose ends . Look , this government was gonna kill me . I don 't give a fuck if it 's the president or the pope or who the fuck else . I ain 't hardly sitting around waiting for somebody to off me . Mama Brooks didn 't raise no stupid-ass children . Oh , there 's my ride . All I gotta do is signal for pickup break the seal on the CMC and in five minutes , I 'm free . Well , look , you could come with me . We could head for the Grand Cayman islands . Break open my piggy bank . Start spending that 100 mil I been stacking . No ! No more of your fucking lies ! We could get your eyes right . That 's the first thing we 'll do , dog . Permanent . You gotta make a decision here , partner . You wanna be a blind old man sitting out the rest of your days on your back porch in the fog , getting sauced ? Or you wanna be somebody again ? No ! It 's over , shut up ! Marco . You 're supposed to say Polo . Don 't play fucking games , right ? Brooks , do not fucking move . Billy ! Brooks ! Brooks ! Polo . It 's in locker number 605 , it 's kept on ice . Howard , what ? That 's impossible . I had my hand over my mouth the entire time . - What 's the trick ? - Ain 't no trick . Of course there 's a trick . - There 's gotta be . - Okay . - You got me , there is a trick . - What ? You 're the only pain in the ass that comes and visit me . - That 's it ? - That 's it . Now , what do you want ? My transmission is fucked . My clutch is mush . - So ? - So before you took my classic on your little joy ride , she was virgin tight . - It 's gonna cost me money . - I knew it was coming . - How much ? - About a grand . Bullshit . That whole truck ain 't worth a grand . All right , 250 , if I get Debbie to do the work . And you 're never , never gonna borrow my ride again . Whatever , I 'll give you a check tomorrow . You better . - Hey , Howard ? - Yeah ? What are you doing later ? You and Debbie wanna come over , have some grub ? With you ? Hey , this is a first . What 's the occasion ? It 's no occasion , it 's just dinner . - Sounds great . What are we having ? - We having steak . Oh , no , no . Absolutely not . Red meat ? Now I know where you get all this aggression . Red meat . Fuck , no wonder you got the Man shooting at you . You 're bringing trouble into your neighbourhood . It 's the whole bad karma , red meat , military-industrial complex ... - ... macho-fantasy bullshit . - Okay . More for us . Shit . What you doing , lighting up the barbecue or burning down my yacht ? I 'm not burning anything , I can 't get the charcoals lit . You know , might have to go inside . You know , with that cooking skills of yours you gonna make a lucky man real happy . All right , shut up . Thank you . Look , I 'm only kidding . Why don 't you come over here and sit down . Take a load off , mama . I 'm all over that . - Here , baby , take that . - Thank you . How 's about a little toast ? You know , actually we have nothing to toast about . - I mean , neither one of us has a job . - True . - Both of our bosses are dead . - As doorknobs . - You killed yours . - Hey , it was self-defence . Greene is back at his cushy job . Swept everything under the carpet like the last two days never even existed . - That 's the way the government do . - There 's no funds for the research . No serum . - And you 're still blind . - As a bat . - So see , there 's nothing to toast to . - I disagree . All right , so , what is there to toast to ? Well , I think that we need to toast to our friendship . To our friendship . Connors , if you go Mr. Rogers on me ... - ... I 'm gonna throw myself off this boat . - Don 't do that , I need you . All right , so , what , you 've got some kind of a friendship toast ? - Matter of fact , I do . - Of course . One of my O.G. killer soldiers taught it to me while we was together on the brig . While you was on the brig ? - All right , let 's hear it . - All right . Here 's to you and here 's to me . And friends we shall be till eternity . And if we ever disagree fuck you , and here 's to me . That is retarded . I know , but you laughed and you toasted . You 're right about that . God , it 's freezing out here . Nice day for a barbeque . Know what , I know someplace that 's not cold . Yeah , me too . Hawaii . I was thinking more of the lines of the Cayman islands . Cayman islands . Name me one good reason to go to the Caymans instead of Hawaii . I got a hundred million good reasons to go . A hundred million reasons ? All right , name me one . Two first-class tickets with our names on them . - You 're full of shit . - I ain 't lying .

 Olivia Dunham . FBI . They 're calling these events 'The Pattern ' . As if someone out there is experimenting only the whole world is their lab . Anybody you need you can have . - His name 's Walter Bishop . - My father . He worked out of Harvard . He was part of a classified US army experimental program . In an area called ' Fringe Science ' . You 're telling me my father was Dr. Frankenstein . So much happened here , and so much is about to . Captain Loeb , what 's your 20 ? We 're in tow . 200 meters out . What 's your ETA ? We 're in position . Standing by . No activity , captain . Roger . Hold position . Charlie ? In position . Standing by . - Delta ? - Standing by captain . In position . Roger . Cutting engines . At South Bank now . South Bank quiet . Bravo , status . All quiet , sir . Wait . I think I hear something . We have tango in sight . All teams move out . Go , go , go , go ! Stop the truck . Stay where you are . Out ! Out ! Get out ! Hands where I can see them ! Panda bears ? I assume you checked inside of them . They knew we were coming . Somewhere they made a switch . Joseph Smith . Began working for the shipping company a week before the container was packed . He had access to the container . He 's also got a science background . Customs has him back and forth from Budapest eight times in the past 12 months . Other local agents on the operation ? Coscarelli and Scrimm . Page 47 . Weight of the container after pickup was 1306 pounds . The weight when it arrived in Germany before shipping , 1299 . That 's seven pounds . What the hell weighs seven pounds ? Mitchel ? Let 's get a medic in here ! What 'd you give him ? One round of Eppy . Intermittent cardiac arrest . I 've never seen anything like this . Pupils fixed one minute dilating the next . - How 's the rhythm now ? - Asystole . Charge the paddles . We 'll start at 200 . Phillip ! Phillip , what 's happening ? - We don 't know . - Is he gonna be okay ? Is it a heart attack ? The only thing for us to do is wait . Clear ! All right . Again , let 's go to 300 . - V. fib . - Clear ! We gotta open him up , pump the heart manually . Prep him . Scalpel . Saw . Retractor . We got something . His heart 's beating . What is that ? I don 't know . It happened in my office two hours ago . It wasn 't a heart attack . At least not in the traditional sense . They cordoned off the area . but ID 's been here already . Said the thing isn 't communicable . The " thing " ? We 'll get to that . - You have any gum ? - No , Walter . - Mints ? - No . Later . Agent Loeb returned from an operation last week in Frankfurt . - Do you know him at all ? - No . He collapsed . Thought it was a seizure at first except he appeared lucid in pain . Didn 't seem like a heart attack either . None of us knew what it was . And none of us know now either . - How are his vital signs ? - Weakening . Dr. Bishop . What you 're about to see ... I don 't know if you 've seen anything like it before . But I 'm hoping you have . I 'm hoping you can help . The man lying in that room is not just a colleague . He 's a friend . I see . Do you have any mints ? This is spectacular . " Spectacular " . I 'm sure he 'd be just thrilled to hear your diagnosis . Do you know what that is ? Your work or your old experiments - Does that look - - Look familiar ? No . Couldn 't be more aberrational . I 'm simply admiring the design . At least , partially organic . Looks like the hybrid result of genetic manipulation . Symmetrical its central body mass . If indeed it is an organism at all ... It 's designed it seems to envelope the entire human heart . Look , look . A series of tendrils . A root system . Don 't you see it ? How beautiful this is ? Not so much , no . Can you help ? Do you think you can remove it ? Oh , I 'd be willing to try . But not here . My breath is atrocious . I was deconstructing in my head the approach to designing something like this . And , and two things occurred to me on the journey from the hospital . One , we could be dealing with something as simple as uh , giardia duodenalis . As simple as that . Really ? It 's a single-celled parasite that lives in the intestines of animals . Common waterborne illness . Could we attach mister ... - Loeb . - Loeb to the vitals machine please ? So you 're saying that ... that thing in his chest ... Is a parasite ? Yes . Yes , perhaps . But with an exceptional means of attachment . Typically , parasites use whole body insertion . This creature is unlike anything I 've seen before . So we won 't be able to truly examine it until it 's removed . Mitchel Loeb 's recent case files as requested . Oh , thanks Astrid . And his wife just arrived . She asked to speak with you . I 'm gonna talk to her in the office . Okay , he 's wired . What was the other thing ? Pardon ? You said that two things occurred to you . What 's the other one ? I would still really like some gum . Or some mints ? Thank you , Peter . Mrs. Loeb ? Olivia Dunham . I 'm with Homeland Security . Samantha . I 'm hoping you can help me . No one will tell me anything . Why was he transferred here ? Can you at least tell me that ? I can tell you that there 's a doctor here , who is ... Uniquely qualified to save your husband 's life . This was in his bag . Among the things he brought home from Frankfurt . I don 't know if it 'll help at all . It might . We 'll check it out . Thank you . Can I see Mitchel ? Please ? As soon as possible . I promise you that . - Uh-oh . - What 's happening ? It 's killing him . It 's squeezing his heart , it 's killing him . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna give him some cyclobenzaprine . If the parasite is constricting , this might loosen its grip . It 's a gamble , but I like the theory . Look at this . This is good . Organism 's tissue . Where the hell are you going ? DNA analysis should tell us much . Excellent work , son . You may have found your true calling at last . Working with me . I certainly hope not . Please tell me you guys have some good news . I don 't know if it 's good news , but it is something . This is fascinating . - What ? - What ? We can assume that this growth , this parasite is of human design , yes ? - Okay . - I was looking for repetition . The signature of the creator . A sign , a ... a footprint That he or she had been there before us . I don 't understand . Well , that puts you in the same group as the rest of humanity . What he 's trying to say is we found this . Ah . See that ? This pattern repeats throughout the DNA sequence . It appears again and again . But it 's too organized to be accidental . Too perfect to be natural . So you 're saying That someone put in this line of DNA on purpose . Why ? Mischief , arrogance . We don 't know . Your friend thinks it might be a code . The other one . I studied cryptology even before I joined the Bureau . I was obsessed as a kid . Now , I keep assuming it can 't be this . That it 's too simple to be plain text . But I think it may just be the Caesar Shift . What 's that ? It 's a simple monoalphabetic cipher . Is it now ? It 's what Julius Caesar used apparently to send letters to his friends . You take one letter and replace it with another but in alphabetical order . There 's a sequence of three letters that appears repeatedly in the parasite 's DNA . It could be CIW or DJX . Or EKY . Or ZFT . Yeah , ZFT fits . What is that ? I 've been reviewing John Scott 's cases checking to see if any of them were mishandled or seeing if any of the cases were left unsolved . - And ? - And one of them that I remember was an operation tracking a group working out of Budapest . The name on the file What was written was " ZFT " That mean something to you ? What ? A month ago , a man ... British national named David Robert Jones was arrested in Frankfurt , Germany by Interpol on possession of state secrets . His background is in deep bio-technology . Notably genetic weaponry . He was a senior fellow at the Bremming Institute for 12 years , then went off the grid . He 'd show up now and then often in Eastern Europe . So you think he 's ZFT . I don 't know . But Loeb did . It was one of the reasons he was in Frankfurt ... Investigating Jones . - Meaning that thing ... - May be retribution . So ZFT , what is it ? Who are they ? Agent Dunham , there is much you have not been made aware of ... Regarding the Pattern . Well , I 'm here . I have time . Are you available ? What we 've learned so far is that ... There are cells . We don 't know how many . Privately funded with presence in 83 recorded countries . ZFT is among them . - So they 're terrorists . - Not in a conventional sense . They traffic not in drugs or weapons but in scientific progress . Meaning what ? Meaning what happened on Flight 627 or what happened to Agent Loeb . These may have been simply proof that a scientific theory , an experiment , worked . So that thing we found in Loeb could be one of those experiments . Do you think Jones will tell us how to remove it ? He might , if we were allowed to see him . German authorities have refused us access . What ? They 're not giving the US access . And he 's being kept in Frankfurt . Yeah . I may be able to get in . You got super powers you aren 't telling me about ? Maybe . You 're not really going to Germany . Yeah , I 'm really going . Let me save you the trip , Dunham . You 're not getting in . We don 't know each other well enough for you to say something like that to me . And I don 't see any other option here . Do you , sir ? Loeb 's your friend . And I promised his wife . What 's wrong ? This may be something of an understatement but he is not doing well . Dehydrated . Walter , come here . What is that ? That 's the root . Coming up from his arm ? Into the IV , yes . This parasite is spreading faster than I thought . How long do you think he 's got ? A day , maybe . Hey . Hi . So the good news is I think we have a lead . The bad news is I have to go to Germany to see him . I don 't think that 's the bad news . He 's dying , Olivia . I don 't think we 're gonna make it . We 're gonna make it . I 'll call you when I land . Look at you . Well , don 't let the suit throw you . Wow , Lucas , I never thought I 'd see the day . It 's more comfortable than the military uniform . Hi . Hi , sorry . I 'm not sure I can help you . You said you have contacts at the prison . I 'm in the Bundestag . I have contacts everywhere . But you jumped on a plane so fast I didn 't have time to check anything out . Well , what did you find ? I know the warden . He wouldn 't agree to anything . He didn 't want me to show up . So what do we do ? Show up . Tenacious as always . What can I do for you , Lucas ? Olivia Dunham , this is Johan Lennox . Thank you for seeing us . You want time with a prisoner ? David Robert Jones . This will be a problem . I 'm sure we can work something out . I 'm sorry . Your friend wants to be persuasive . Mr. Lennox , you have your reasons why you won 't allow access to your prisoners but this is very important to me . I would be willing to sign anything . I like her . You have good taste . Even if I were to give the okay , Mr. Jones talks to no one . I have reason to believe he will talk to me . If I write him a message , will you give it to him ? I don 't expect miracles . I don 't know if I expect anything . But I am grateful for whatever you can do in this case . Sorry ? I was just saying I 'm grateful for your work . You 're most welcome . You know , I had a fruit cocktail once , in Atlantic City . Mind you , I 'm not the fruit cocktail sort-of-guy . Excuse me . We need to discuss your father . Is it the fruit cocktail thing again ? Yeah , he 's been doing that recently . He gets obsessed about certain foods . It 's weird . We need him to focus . To focus ? Mr. Broyles , two-thirds of the time , my father 's not even lucid . And in those rare and unpredictable moments of clarity , he rambles on about the foods and beverages that he missed while he was incarcerated in a mental institution for the better part of the last two decades . To say that he 's not focused , is to say that he 's a biped . Which is to say , you 're absolutely right . He 's not focused . And also , it 's not going to change any time too soon . I 'm his son . I 'm not a puppeteer . I don 't have a remote control . There 's no master switch I can flick and turn him into the man I wish had raised me . Or even somebody I don 't have to baby-sit every day . I guess I 've had that on my mind for awhile . Apparently . Broyles . It 's Charlie Francis . I understand I 'm not at clearance level but I have something for you . What is it ? Local connecontion to the ZFT . Speak to me . We analyzed the document Loeb brought back from Frankfurt . We figured out each line corresponds to an FBI case file . And an ID number for the agent or agents assigned to it . Every one of them originating from this field office . Another mole in this office ? And you think what ? John Scott ? He was working with the ZFT ? Maybe , maybe not . Whoever did this needed upper level security clearance . Access to the FBI mainframe . You said local connection . Yeah , one of the lines is a phone number registered to a Joseph Smith and we have him tied ... Yeah , I know Joseph Smith . Loeb was briefing me on him when he collapsed . You got an address ? Hold on . 4331 Broad Street , Saugus . 4331 Broad Street . I 'll call you back . This is Broyles . I want a SWAT team surrounding Joseph Smith . He 's at 4331 Broad Street in Saugus . And I want this radio silent . It 's good to see you again . Despite the strange circumstance . You don 't have to wait with me . As you keep telling me . I want to . I like it here . Thank you . I 'm surprised . He 'll see you . But not until tomorrow morning . This is not Jones ' rule or mine . This is the institution 's . Long before I got here , there have been strict regulations regarding visitors . Tomorrow morning , you 'll have 14 minutes . Not a second more . Mr. Jones wanted you to have this . Hello . Peter , it 's me . I 'm looking for Broyles . Is he there ? No , he 's on some sort of raid . Jones has agreed to meet with me tomorrow morning . But only on the condition he first gets to talk to a colleague of his . So we 're looking for a guy local to Boston . He 's in Saugus . He 's in what ? His name 's Joseph Smith . At 4331 Broad Street . How 'd you know that ? That 's who Broyles is after right now . What ? - How ? - I-I don 't know . Peter , we need him alive . - Hey ! - Are you there ? No . I 'm on my way . You get in touch with Broyles yet ? No , they 're still radio silent . I 'm gonna call HQ . I 'll call you back . I know they 're radio silent but you 've got to get someone down there right now . Please , you need to get the message to them . They need to keep Joseph Smith alive . Goddamn it . - You must stand back , sir . - Hey . I 've got information . - No , I need to talk to Joseph Smith - - You need to get back . You are not authorized to get any closer to the house ! - Hey . - Are you close ? Yeah , I 'm here but I can 't get any closer to the house . They 're already inside . On the roof ! On the roof ! Oh , no . What ? Peter . Freeze ! FBI ! Stop or we 'll shoot ! Drop your weapon ! No , no , no , no ! Peter ? Have the evidence response team catalog and box every item down to the toilet paper . Bishop , what are you doing here ? Well , I just got off the phone with Olivia . She 's headed back to the airport . Turns out Mr. Jones would only help us if he could talk to Mr. Smith . The same Mr. Smith that your people just killed . You 're kidding me . That 's the first serious thing I 've said all day . Hello . Peter ! Hey , it 's Astrid . Your father wanted me to inform you that there is fluid accumulating in Agent Loeb 's lungs . Tell him we need help quickly . He says we need help quickly . Insert this into his IV . Let me talk to him . Uh , hello , Peter . This is me , your father . Walter Bishop . Thank you , Walter . I know who you are . Excellent . Uh , we need to talk to that man Smith right away . He may be our best chance to save Agent Loeb 's life . I know that , but he 's dead . He was shot . We 're out of luck . Well , does he still have his head ? Is it still attached to his body ? Only you would ask that question seriously . Yes , he still has a head . Splendid . Then perhaps in this case , death is simply an inconvenience . Bring him in and hurry . Agent Loeb 's tissue is already deteriorating which makes it exponentially messier . What ? So close . You never did lose well . What happened , Olivia ? There is something that has shifted in you . Something 's happened . Well , a lot has happened . You know , it 's been a strange time . I wasn 't gonna say these words . But here we are , so I 'm gonna say them . I 've become , and I am not kidding ... A spectacular cook . Spend the night . I can 't , Lucas . Of course you can . Of course you can . Dunham . Does Jones know about Smith ? What ? Does David Jones know that Joseph Smith is dead ? No , why ? 'cause if you can still get in to see him tomorrow He may not have to . Oh good , uh , bring him down here so quickly . - Get me ice . - You already asked . - And the halo head brace . - It 's right over there . We got it from here . Thanks . Uh , did I ask ... To put salt water in the trough , yes . 90 kilograms . Not a drop more ! He 's been shot in the head . Is that a problem ? Yes , that 's a problem . Of course , it 's a problem ! A bullet in the head would normally indicate significant brain trauma . Well , it would also indicate that he 's dead . But you didn 't seem to have a problem with that . This procedure is not like removing tonsils . I 've never had a conversation with a dead guy before . Forgive me if I don 't know the rules . Is this going to work or not ? I 'll need to alter the procedure . And I 'm not making any promises . 86 degrees , Dr. Bishop . Good. almost there . Let me know when it 's exactly 84.5 blue . The human brain 's like a computer , green . Just needs electricity to function , which the body ceases to produce upon death . Which is why we 're keeping his body cold to retard degeneration . It 's astonishing how this man 's scalp resembles - Peter 's bare bottom when he was a baby . How did you know that ? You told us that already , twice . What did I say next ? That we 're gonna kick-start his brain . Ah , yes ! Excellent . Conductive gel to prevent the electrical current from setting him on fire . Spread it evenly . And don 't forget his nipples . Oh , Peter ! In ' 75 , the FBI asked me to use this procedure . Someone had been murdered . But I don 't recall his name . Hmm . James , I believe , or Jimmy . They want me to identify his assessee . Union leader , I think . Jimmy Hoffa ? Yes . Well the ... the trouble was , he had a shockingly low electro-sensitivity . When I turned on the machine , it instantly fried his brain like an egg . Everyone has a unique tolerance to electrical stimulation . Mine for instance , is remarkably high . Yours Peter , unusually low . As for our friend here , we don 't know . Too little current , and it won 't work . Too much , and we will overcook his brain . So I will have ... You used to do this to me . You attached wires to car batteries and then you would shock me . Yes , I was accumulating data . No , you were experimenting on me . Son , we 're ready . First we must test if this ... will register any brain activity . And this will indicate if he 's transmitting any thoughts to you . Since he 's dead , Peter , you 'll obviously have to be his ears and mouth . Eventually , we 'll connect this to your head . Okay , dear , we 're ready . Turn it on . Try 200 microvolts . Oh , look , Peter . He 's talking to you . I suppose it 's a good thing it wasn 't attached to your head . Not kidding . Looked into it . - You have not . - I have . So ? Who was he ? Whoever it was who broke your heart . Or am I misreading you ? He was my partner from the Bureau . And you of all people should know that I 've always been a little inept at this . But he was straight-forward , decisive , charming , and it was wonderful . Except it was all a lie , and he betrayed me . Betrayed the job . Then he died . That 's the end . That 's the end for him . I 've known this for years . I screwed up ... With you . The timing wasn 't right for either of us . Yes , it was . I know it was . But I was scared . And that 's the ... that 's the God 's honest truth . I think about you ... So often and ... I don 't call because ... Because I 'm ashamed of how I treated you . No , it was just ... Lucas , I ... I ... I have to ... I have ... I have to get this . I hate whoever that is . Hello . Hey , you 're not gonna believe this 'cause I 'm not really sure that I do . But I think this might actually work . Walter figured it out ? Well , there are limits . Some issues and problems . But Walter seems to think we can get the dead guy to answer some questions . Then we 're on . I 'll call you from the prison . 8 : 00 AM , tomorrow , my time . You okay ? I 'm good . Thank you . I 'm gonna go back to the hotel . Grateful to you , to the incredible cooking and your sweet words . Do you hear anything ? I think we gotta ask him a question first . I see . Are we ready to see how this is working ? When I say go , you , Astro , ask Peter a question . I will flip the switch which will stimulate our naked friend 's brain . And Peter , you will hear his response . Any questions ? Uh , yeah . What should I ask him ? Anything you like . It 's only a dry run . And , son , I should apologize in advance . I 'm afraid this ... Well , I shouldn 't frighten you . No . Wouldn 't want to do that . Three , two , one . Go ! What 's your favorite flavor of ice cream ? Anything ? Did I hear anything ? No . Three , two , one . Go ! What 's your favorite color ? Nope. still nothing . Just extreme discomfort . Hello . They 're taking me to see Jones now . It 's Olivia . They 're taking her in . No. we 're not ready yet . No , no , no . Tell her she has to stall . Did you hear that ? I 'll do what I can , but I 've only got 14 minutes starting now . 14 minutes . What a pleasure this is . We have your Mr. Smith in custody . You will not speak with him directly . You will ask me one question that you want answered . I will relay that question to an agent back in the States who will talk to Mr. Smith . I will then relay Mr. Smith 's response to you . Then you will tell me how to save Agent Loeb . That is how it works . You 're very serious , do you know that ? Your friend 's life hangs in the balance . Is that it ? And you want me to save him . I gathered as much from your note . Tell me something . Why not your freedom ... Or extradition ? You must realize that you have leverage here . Yet all you want is the answer to one question ? You make two assumptions , Ms. Dunham , both incorrect . The first is that there is nothing more valuable than my freedom . The second is that I am responsible for the infection of Agent Loeb . Hello , Gene . Shh , not a word . I think I know your problem . You think too much . It 's a family curse . Your own brain function is interfering with the process . You need to be a passive receiver . This is a sedative . It will numb your higher brain function . I 've mixed it with a euphoria inhibitor . Which will clear the high from your system In a matter of minutes . If I tell you to , stick this in his chest right here . Beneath the breast bone . What is that ? - Adrenaline . - Why , Walter ? Are you planning on stopping my heart ? Walter , what are you giving me ? Nothing for you to worry about . Perfectly harmless . What is going on in here ? Mitchel ! If you 're not responsible for infecting Agent Loeb , who is ? Perhaps the same people responsible for bringing us together . What if someone wanted information from the both of us ? Do you see ? Perhaps they 've orchestrated all of this . What if you and I ... Both of us , at this very moment , were being manipulated ? By whom ? And what would they want ? You 've not been doing this very long , have you ? There are very few things in life that surprise me anymore , Ms. Dunham . And yet , I confess , I am confused . If it is so urgent to save the life of your friend , why haven 't we gotten on with it ? Peter . Peter , can you hear me ? This can 't possibly be scientific . Peter , look at me . Daddy ? Hmm . I think we 're ready . - Hello ? - Go , quick . Go ahead , ask your question . Ask my friend Joe ... Where does the gentleman live ? Mr. Jones would like to know , where does the gentleman live ? Three . Mitchel ! oh , god . What is it ? Parasite in his bloodstream choking him of oxygen . - Asteroid , nitroglycerine in a vial on the desk . - Wait a minute . I don 't understand . A parasite ? - Could you give us some room , please ? - I 'll call you back . Come on , Sam , let them do their job . Is there a problem ? My phone doesn 't get the best reception in prison isolation cells . You do have Mr. Smith , do you not ? I 'm curious . Why do you think he would cooperate with you after you had him arrested ? Oh , the people I work with are loyal to the end . Can you say the same ? Hello . Okay , we 're trying again . Three , two , one . Go ! Where does the gentleman live ? Do you hear anything ? No , no . I 'm going to have to increase the voltage . I 'm sorry , son . Three , two , one . Go . Where does the gentleman live ? Uh-uh , nothing . No . Astrid , I need the answer now . Agent Dunham , it 's not working . I need paper . Paper ! Give me some paper . Quick , quick . I see something . Wait , hold on . Untie my hand . Quickly ! What is that ? I have no idea ! I need the answer now . We don 't have it yet . I don 't think it 's working . Walter , what is this ? How do I know ? You saw it , not me . He seems rather irritated with you . Astrid , please . I have no time . I know , you have to hold on . I 'm sorry . Walter , what is it ? Do you see it ? It 's there . There 's just something missing . Obviously , horizontal lines . There 's literature on this . Misrepresentation of horizontal space in unilateral brain damage . Astrid , please , hurry . I - I don 't understand . It 's just a conjecture . But the bullet may have destroyed that part of the brain that ... that helps process horizontal lines . We are going to have to fill in the blanks . God , Astrid , I have no time . I need the answer now , Astrid ! Please ! - Little Hill . - Little Hill ? Little Hill ! Three parts mebendazole . Two parts thermophilic hydrolase . A syringe directly into the parasite . Astrid , write this down . Three parts mebendazole . Two parts thermophilic hydrolase . A syringe directly into the parasite . Walter , look . The roots , they 're dying . Well does that mean that ... Is ... is Mitchel gonna live ? Is ... is he gonna be okay ? Yes my dear . I believe he will . Thank you , Dr. Bishop . Jones asked me a question about loyalty . And something about the way he said it , it felt like he knew something . Like what ? Something about my partner betraying the Bureau . I don 't know . You know , I have other means of gathering information about Mr. Jones . If you 'd like me to use them . Say yes , Olivia . It 'll give me an excuse to call you again . Mitchel , I understand that you 're feeling far from 100 % . But while you were unconscious , we made a discovery . That an organization with connections to the Pattern may have someone working for us on the inside . John Scott . That was our first thought . But he would have needed to have higher clearance than Scott was afforded . We thought that perhaps you were talking to him because you might have discovered who that person was . Scott 's the only one I know of . You 're making me paranoid . All I want to do is make you better . I 'll see you in the morning . All right . Please seeing you ! Sir . How is he ? He 's good . The doctor here removed that thing from his chest . Walter made sure he saved it for him . I bet he did . But what about answers ? The question Jones asked Smith . And the response he got , " Little Hill " ? We know that Agent Loeb was infected , but we don 't know by whom . Jones says it wasn 't him . We don 't know anything . You have a problem , Agent Dunham . You 're not easily satisfied . You want everything and you want it now . In your mind , somehow a small victory is no victory . What you did was save a man 's life but that doesn 't land for you . Sir ... I would tell you to snap the hell out of it . To stop whining about what you can 't know , can 't control , can 't change . I would tell you to get some sleep while you can because tomorrow , we 'll do this all over again . And guess what ? You 'll have a million new answers and a million and one new questions . I would tell you those things , but I won 't . Because your dissatisfaction , is what makes you so damn good . Someone I 'm proud to say I work with . Thank you . Now go get some sleep while you can . Hey , how you feeling ? I should be asking you that . - Good job . - Thank you . You too . You hungry ? After everything I saw today , no , not at all . But I am thirsty . Really , really thirsty . Me too . Look at that . Yeah , look at that . They 're gone . So did it work . What we did ? Yes. it led them back to Mr. Jones . Did he ask the question ? And did we get the answer ? Little Hill .

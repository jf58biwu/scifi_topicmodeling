 Annie was killed by Owen . We 've been deluding ourselves we could ever be accepted by proper human beings . We are monsters . Everything Owen and I ever had can go to ash . They 're only human ? Then it 's our mistake wanting to be like them . I 'm in . 'We meet people and fall in love 'and when we part they leave marks for us to remember them by . 'Our lovers sculpt us . 'They define us , for better or worse . 'Like a pinball , we slam into them and rebound in a different direction , 'propelled by the contact . 'And after the parting , we might be scarred . 'But stronger . 'Or more fragile , 'or needy , or angry , 'or guilty . 'It 's never unchanged . 'Our lovers linger inside us like ghosts ... 'haunting the corridors and deserted rooms . 'Sometimes whispering . 'Sometimes screaming . 'Invisible , but ... 'always there . 'Waiting . ' More jam . How many is that now ? That 's ... eleven jars . I wonder what it is about us that says " we need jam . " It 's a gesture . They feel guilty . Yeah , so was writing " paedo " on the front door . I 'm going to haunt Owen . OK . I think that 's why I 'm still here . In fact I 'm certain , and I thought finding out what happened would be it , but there 's clearly more to it because , well , look , I haven 't gone . Mmm . Have you spoken to Mitchell ? Chance would be a fine thing . I 've barely seen him , have you ? Not since the other night , when ... well , since the accident . Do you need any help ? Um ... .. yeah . Thanks , but I don 't really know what I 'm going to do yet , but ... Right , well , can I just state for the record , that I understand why you 're doing this , but I don 't want you to go . Noted . The door opens and it 's the hotel manager ! And he kind of stops . I 'm having a cigarette , and Mitchell 's face is like , covered with blood , and there 's this dead girl lying on the bed . Which reminds me , she 's coming by later . So the manager is standing there , staring at this scene and then there 's this kind of silence . And Mitchell says ... LAUGHS " Ah , tomb service . " LAUGHTER I can 't tell you how delighted I am to welcome Mitchell back . These are exciting times , my friends , and I know I 've said it before ... Look , they 're rolling their eyes . They know what I 'm going to say . But it 's true ! Come on , say it with me . No-one gets left behind ! Behind . Come here . Er ... I just want to say thank you for taking me back . I 've seen what humanity is really like and this is where I belong . I 'm home now . Maybe you can explain something . A funeral parlour ? This has been bothering me . Aren 't we skirting a little close to a cliche here ? Well , there 's a practical reason . After they 've died , the recruits , this is where they 're brought . But there 's more to it than that . Our very existence is a union of life and death . Cemeteries , hospitals , funeral parlours , are all places where the two worlds meet and overlap . We feel at home here . These are our churches . Plus there 's plenty of room for storage . It is so great to have you back . Owen . Owen ! Oh , is that it ? It 's rubbish , isn 't it ? What would Patrick Swayze do ? What do you mean ? Well , what effect do you want to have ? Maybe it would help if we knew what you wanted to achieve . I want him to confess , I guess . So tell him . " Confess ! " Confess ! Put a bit of a hiss on the end there - fessss ! Confessss ! Confesssss ! Yeah , that was nice . Throw in some spooky stuff as well . You know like , " I am ... " I am darkness ! I am death ! " I am darkness ! I am death ! It 's not like the films , is it ? We don 't even know if he 's going to be able to see you . Oh , he 'll be able to see me . Everything 's different now . I know what I 'm supposed to do . Well , maybe we 're underestimating what just that will do to him . You know what I said about making him confess . It 's not just that . I want to scare him , to make him ... cry and beg and scream . It 's not just about justice . It 's more jagged than that . Is that wrong ? It 's human . Not everything about being human is nice . You know how this works . Come in . Ready to spread a little joy ? Duncan Johnson . 41 years old . AIDS related Cytomegalovirus . He 's got about five weeks , tops . What does he do ? He 's an engineer . Now , you know what I wanted to be ? An architect . I had this little picture book when I was a kid . Spires and castles , cathedrals . I 'd kind of dream of them , you know . And my own buildings too , they 're like ... coloured blocks , scattered across a mountainside . I still dream about that picture book . And now there 's this . This ... chose me . Herrick . Don 't frighten him . He hasn 't come to terms with what 's happening to him yet . He 's angry and scared and ... he doesn 't want to die . Who does ? Mr Johnson ? Please don 't be alarmed . Forgive me if I dispense with the niceties . no-one more than you knows that time is of the essence . Now , my name is William Herrick . And I have a proposition for you ... Yeah , it just stopped working again . Uh-huh . Yeah , I 'm turning it now . No , not even a rattle . Could you ? That would be great . Um , six ... seven ? Yeah , well , if I 'm not here , then just let yourself in . Lovely . OK , yep , see you then . It 's done . Owen 's coming . Black coffee . No sugar , just a splash of cold water from the tap . Hello , Josie . My God . Is it really you ? You haven 't changed . Neither have you . Liar . What are you doing here ? I live here . I work here . You ? Oh , we moved here when my husband retired . You 're married . Oh , he died . Five years ago . Oh , I 'm sorry . What about you ? No . Just me . As ever . All alone . No , I have a house I share with some friends . Are they ... ? They 're not vampires , they 're something else . We came here to Bristol , one weekend , do you remember ? The Clifton Hotel . Mr and Mrs McCartney . It was the sixties . Beatlemania . It was the first thing I could think of . I stole my mother 's wedding ring . We only left the hotel was to buy more cigarettes and chocolate . Sorry , we need to talk . All right , George . This is Josie . George is one of the people I talked about . Oh , right , hi . Yeah , hi . Josie and I dated for a while . In the sixties . It 's fine . She knows about us , it 's cool . Right , er , yes ... Right ... um ... What do you want to talk about ? Er ... we can talk later . That was mean . What ? Why ? Mitchell . You just outed him . So why are you here ? Are you sick ? Lung cancer . Can they ... ? No . Look at you . Frozen ... like a photograph . George ! Why , why bother ? Hello , you . I hope you 're not going to take that out of their deposit . Annie ? Not any more . I am darkness . I am death , vengeance and fury . Fire and blood . Diamonds and bones . Sapphire and ... steel . Confess , Owen ! Confessssss ! Textbook . Hey , Annie . That the best you 've got ? I knew it , I fucking knew it ! All that stuff happening at my house . I thought it was just ... guilt . You see , I should have known that even death wouldn 't be a match for one of your sulks . I mean , that 's what this is , isn 't it ? It 's the Isle of Wight all over again . A sulk ? You killed me ! So what are you then , a ghost ? How does this work ? What ? Come on , spit it out ! Quiet as the grave . Well ... I think we 're done here , don 't you ? I should charge rent for three . See you . What 's everyone doing ? Well , Sorenson has just farted , so all the men are high-fiving each other . It 's like dinner with the Kennedys up there . Everyone looking after you ? They won 't leave me alone . I can 't even take a piss without someone saying , " Hey , mind if I tag along ? " Yeah , and I bet that was Seth . What can I say , we 're just thrilled to have you back . Anything ? No , it could be a while yet . Hmm , yeah , take a break . Go and sit with the guys from MENSA upstairs . No , there needs to be someone here when he wakes up . The things he 'll have seen in-between . I was wondering ... If you 're recruiting people , making offers , could you talk to somebody I know ? Sure . Who ? Ah , she 's just an old friend . She 's at the hospital . She 's ill . What does she do ? Mmm , I 'm not sure , she was a dance teacher when I knew her . Not exactly a key worker . But what the hell . Come the revolution , we 'll all need to know how to dance . Great . Thank you . You shouldn 't do that . Let them take someone you care about . Why not ? They might become cruel . It changes you , this life . It didn 't change me . It did . It just took longer . What 's going on , Lauren ? I thought you were happy . How could I not be happy ? They 're catering to my every need . It 's OK , it 's all right . Men . There were men there . I know , it 's OK , you 're safe now , you 're home now . He didn 't freak out ... at all ? It does make sense really when you think about it , we were expecting him to react like a sane person , even though this is someone who killed his fiance , concealed it and then rented out the crime scene . So what do we do now ? I 'll have to see Janey , I guess . I 'll go while he 's at work . Owen 's girlfriend ? Otherwise she 'll be next , won 't she ? Hello , stranger . Hey , you 're back late . Yeah . I had a ... stuff at the , er ... It was a mad day . Any of these a coffee ? Oh ... um , that one , that one maybe . So , um ... I 've decided to haunt Owen . Cool . Yeah , I wanted to talk it through with you first , but ... anyway , he saw me today , but he didn 't react as I expected . So now I think I 'll have to see Janey . Sounds like a plan . Where have you been ? Work . I told you . Not all the time . I 've been busy . You 're back with them , aren 't you ? It 's different now . Oh , Mitchell . Are you killing again ? It 's voluntary . No-one 's being forced to do anything . We 're giving people hope . Well , now I 've heard everything . But you 've always said that getting the house was to be part of humanity so that you could retreat from what you are . Humanity ? Most of humanity still point at planes ... The way you two talk about them . How charming they are , how benign . Like they 're Howard from the fucking Halifax . They are stupid and thuggish and cruel and we will never be like them , and thank God for that . They are the monsters . I just can 't believe it 's taken me this long to work it out . 'It 's a lot to take in , I know , it 's about being another option . ' If I agreed ... what would happen ? Would I get better ? Instantly . And not just you , everyone ! Places like this would be museums ! It 'll end all famine , all war . Oh , please , please , stop the spin . I don 't know who you are when you talk like this . But I wouldn 't ... I 'd be like this . I wouldn 't be young . No . You 'd be ... Frozen , like a photograph ? With you ? Forever . I 'm sorry . It 's OK , it 's OK , it was the same for me at the start . No , no , that was different . Being human means being mortal . It means dying . You can 't rob people of that . No-one 's being robbed , don 't you see ? It 's a choice . It 's a trick ! Christ , Mitchell , just because they 're handing themselves over voluntarily , it doesn 't stop it being a con . You 're offering something you have no right to . Of course people want eternal life . People want capital punishment , that doesn 't make it right . It 's evolution . Never a birth , never a death ? That 's not evolution , that 's a full stop ! Getting him to approach me , was that really your idea ? The Mitchell I knew would never have dreamed ... I wanted to save you . No . I don 't think it was that . These people you live with , your friends , do they know about this ? I think that 's why you asked him to talk to me . Because you knew I 'd tell you this . Janey . It 's me . No , no , no , no , don 't ! Great , so YOU freak out ! Hiya . Aaaaaaargh ! Janey ! No ! Janey ! Janey , I 'm not going to hurt you . You took my shoes off . Oh , my God , why did you take my shoes off ? You fainted . That 's what you do when people faint . You did it to keep me here ! You did it so I couldn 't get away ! Look , if I wanted to keep you here I would have chopped your feet off . Oh , no ! Look , I 'm not going to chop your feet off ! But you 're dead . You died . You fell down the stairs and cracked your head open . That 's not what happened . Owen said . Owen ... .. killed me . That 's not true . It 's why I 'm still here . I can 't let it go . I needed to warn you ... because ... next it 'll be you . You 're lying . He loves me . If you tell me that he has never laid a finger on you , never , not even for a second made you feel scared , then I 'll walk away right now . Sometimes he gets ... What ? No . You need to say it . No ! I 'm going mad , that 's all . It 's like what happened to my Aunty Linda . She kept seeing the Bronte Sisters in her en-suite . Owen ! Owen ! Owen ! What 's wrong ? I 'm going mad , I 'm going mad . What are you talking about ? I 'm seeing things ! It 's Annie . She 's here , Owen , she was going to chop my feet off ! OK , that 's totally out of context . I can 't see anything . Don 't listen to him , Janey . He 's lying , he 's looking at me . It 's still talking , it 's got her voice . Sweetheart . I swear to you , I can 't see a thing . Can 't you ? Don 't listen to him , Janey . Listen to me , you saw me , you spoke to me . Oh , God , make it stop . What 's it been saying , baby ? What do you think it 's been saying ? It said ... you killed her . Did it now ? You know what I think this is ? A delayed reaction . How do you mean ? You see I think that you 're feeling guilty because of what we were doing when she was alive . Because of the affair . Yeah . All the emails and texts . That time at your work . In the Lexus . Our engagement party . Our engagement party ? But how ? In the disabled toilets . You see , I think this is all just a reaction to that . And you know something ? You see now , Annie , she would love this . She was always so bitter . All her life , bitter towards people that were cleverer than her . People that did something . She would stand at the side and snipe and bitch , never participate , never risk . So she lived her life in the periphery . Like a ghost . So you don 't think I 'm going mad ? No , baby . I think that this is a testament to just how wonderful and caring a person you are . And you really can 't see anything ? Come on . You know what ? I really can 't . The doctor will be over in a minute . Hello , my boyfriend . Hello , my girlfriend . Couple of things , my boyfriend : Lucy Willis , the thrombosis patient . She 's going to tag along with the porters whenever they take anyone to physio or x-ray cos , well , it 's the only way we can get the bloody woman to do any exercise . Gotcha . Second thing : the results are in and it turns out that you have a smashing arse . I see . Well , in that case , can I point out that you have two amazing ... I need to talk to you . Erm ... Yes ... Look . I don 't know what Mitchell said to you about ... Shut up . Right you are . Mitchell 's in trouble . What ? He introduced me to another vampire . To recruit me . To make me one of them . The vampires are mobilizing . Oh , they 're making it sound all New Labour , but this is an invasion . It 's a coup . And the first thing they 're doing is recruiting on a bigger scale than ever before . They 're talking to people who are dying . Mitchell 's part of this ? He 's how they 're getting in . Oh , Christ ! Well , what do we do now ? Your thing . Can I ask , is it anything ... ? Useful ? No ... no ... my thing is a part-time thing . Oh , right . I thought perhaps you were a ... wizard , or something . A wizard ? Oh , God , that 's ridiculous . Once you 've dated a vampire , you tend to have a different criteria for what 's ridiculous . OK . I need to go home . I need to ... How many people are they planning to recruit ? How ... how bad is this ? He said it . The man . He said ... .. " No-one gets left behind . " Hiya . You know what I don 't get ? Why Bristol ? Why not London , or Manchester ? What 's all that about ? Well , the first vampire settled here in 1630 . Richard Turner . We never got round to getting our shit somewhere else . The first vampire lived here ? The first to have a double life . He ran for Parliament , he was a slave-trader , killed maybe , I don 't know , a thousand people . Eugh ! No-one ever knew . Has nobody told you this stuff ? All the best stories are about you , Mitchell . Everyone else is like , " I got this tramp in a doorway . " But with you , all they ever talk about is when Mitchell did those twins , Mitchell got that soldier , I mean ... I need to talk to Herrick . You want me to ring you through ? I want you to get out of my way . We should do this more often . Mitchell 's here . Hello ? You didn 't give her long enough . The last one , I told him , she 'd just come back for Christ 's sake . What are you doing here ? Look , please . There has to be an order to this . That 's why Michael died and Daisy got so sick . What are you talking about ? We keep quiet . We eat when you say . But there are too many of you now . No-one has time to recover . Are they ... feeding from you ? Don 't do this . Please . How long have you been here ? Weeks . There were other people 's clothes when we got in here . There were toys under the bed . We WERE going to tell you . But , like so much in life , it all comes down to timing . Annie , Annie , Annie , we 've got to rescue Mitchell . The thing with the vampires , oh , my God , it 's a lot worse than we thought . There 's this woman at the hospital , she 's f ... No , I 'll , er ... I 'll tell you on the way . They 're ... They 're ... based at an undertakers . Stereotypes clearly hold no fear for these people . I have no idea what I 'm looking for . Something , something to defend myself with , but so far I have a whisk and I have my mobile phone recharger . So that 's ... that 's .. I mean , what do we take ? Do we take crosses and garlic ? I know , we should have watched more films ! We should ... You should have answered me . Anytime you want to chip in , say something constructive , do feel free ( ! ) I can 't . I 'm sorry , what did you say ? It 's beaten me . I can 't move . I can 't ... Owen 's won . I can 't touch him . He just keeps on killing me . OK , first off , you need to stop talking . Then you need to stand up and help . You don 't understand . No . Mitchell , our friend , needs you . Your friend . So if you can 't do this , then you have done to yourself the one thing Owen could never do . Because then you HAVE finally died . Are you sure this is the vampire headquarters ? Good afternoon , I 'm so sorry , I 'm afraid we 're closed for business at the moment , but I do have a number of a ... Oh , my God . What do you want ? Well , either you have the world 's worst customer service or we 're in the right place . We want to see Mitchell . Are you out of your mind ? Piss off before I call the others . Can we leave a message , then ? What the cock is that ? I 'm a ghost , actually . Get out ! Can you , like , move things about and walk from one room to another ? Yeah , I 'm pretty sure everyone can do that ... Shut it , Digby . The only reason why I haven 't torn your bastard face off yet is cos I 've just done the hoovering in here . Mm-hm . OK , I 'm going to get Mitchell . That 's it . I 'm gonna call my boys in , we 're gonna have some fun with you . Annie ! A bit of help here ? Sorenson ! Bell ! Good move ( ! ) I wanna hear you bark , little dog . Did you just hit me with a chair ? Yes ! Sorry . What is wrong with you people ? That totally fucking hurt ! For Christ 's sake , Annie , hit him again ! Hit him again ? Hit him again ! AGAIN ! We 're gonna do this Old School . Again , Annie ! Again ! That was pathetic . We were like the world 's gayest ninjas . What ? I don 't get it . I hit him with a chair and nothing , and you punch him with your girly arm and he 's knocked out . I think my Star of David weakened him . Mitchell sees it all the time . He looks after it when I transform , why doesn 't it affect him ? Oh , God . I feel sick . I think that was my first actual fight . Yeah , well ... You 'd better get used to it . This is our life now . How 's your hand ? It really hurts . It 's really ... I think I 've bruised ... No ... the bone . Those people in that room , who are they ? Oh , kinda runaways mostly . You said it was going to be voluntary . This whole thing . That didn 't look very voluntary to me ! How did you think this was going to be done ? You know , with " please " and " thank you " , " may I be so bold ? " Evolution has casualties . You know the Romans , you know they devoured almost every inch of the entire world , giving us irrigation , medicine and democracy . The Ottoman Empire conquered three continents , giving us education , a judicial system . Now do you think that all of that was achieved without dropping a single ounce of blood ? This is the natural churn of history , Mitchell . We 're not good or bad , we 're just what happens next . The people in that room , how do they fit in ? Well , they 're a kind of dry run . A theory . But you haven 't recruited them . I never said I wanted a 100 % conversion . There 'll always be a portion of humanity kept alive , kept pure . Why ? We 've got to eat . And that 's what it comes down to . Historical precedents . Slogans . It 's smoke and mirrors . You just want to feed . You just want to kill . But it feels so nice . I can 't do this . I 'm sorry , Mitchell . You can 't just hop in and out as the mood grabs you , you know . You can 't just dip your toe . It sends a message . You understand , don 't you ? We 'll be kind . And my friends ? You mean the dog ? There 's another one . A ghost . What about if , erm ... .. when it happens ... .. I promise it 'll be me , not ... not Seth , no . Not , not anyone like him . So how do we do this ? Well , we can do it right here . Have a drink , choose a chair , break a leg and sharpen it . Do me a favour . Afterwards , don 't talk about me the way you do . Don 't tell each other those stories about the things I did . That 's not how I want to be remembered . I never had you down as vain . I just don 't want to be an inspiration like that . Better to be forgotten than that . Shall we ? Who wants some of my chair ? ! Totally should have prepared something ... Run ! Run ! I went ahead to check the coast was clear . And is it ? Very much not . What , did anyone see you ? Erm .. possibly . Shit . This way . Annie ? No , I 'm here . Come here , mate . Annie ! Get away from here . No , I 'm not going to leave you . Annie , just go ! That won 't work , Digby . There 's too many of us . Let them go Seth ! If you let him go and I swear I won 't run ! Ow ? Well , he won 't be staring at my tits when he speaks to me any more . Let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go , come on . Come on ! Go , go , go , go . This way , this way ! Come on ! Where are we even going ? I don 't know . We 'll find somewhere . Come on . There 's nowhere . No , it 's fine , really , we can hide . I can 't hide from me , though . What are you talking about ? You can 't go back . Mitchell , come on ! You brought me into this world . - Wait , wait ... - I want you to take me out of it . No . No way . Absolutely not . Please . Lauren . You saw the people in that room . Come on , Mitchell ! I go down there . Don 't do this . No , George , wait . Their faces . Oh , God , sometimes they didn 't even fight . What are you doing ? Why didn 't you tell me ? Because you would have stopped me , and I liked it too much . Mitchell ! Oh , Lauren , please don 't make me do this . You have to . The me I used to be , the me that got hay fever and was scared her parents would find out she smoked , she 's almost gone . Soon all that 's going to be left is her . Oh , Lauren , I can 't . There isn 't time . But you saved us . So save me . Somebody needs to stop him , Mitchell . He wants to tear everything down . Here it comes . Oh , my ! CRACKING Thank you . Not for the tea . Well , if I 'd known it was going to be so Andy McNabb , I might not have bothered . I 'm sorry about Lauren . Hi , honey , I 'm home ! I got your message . So ... The gang 's all here . What are they , your backing singers ? Oh , fuck . You 're not ghosts as well , are you ? I knew I should have got references ... Can I ask you something ? Is the point of all this to make me feel guilty ? Is that what we 're doing here ? Because it won 't work . Because here 's the thing they never tell you . You see to kill someone ... .. and get away with it ... .. you 're bullet-proof . You 're a god . There 's a question you haven 't asked yourself yet . If I exist , what else does ? You think you 're the big bad wolf , you should see George on a full moon . You think you 're a cold-blooded murderer ... .. Mitchell was killing eighty years before you were even born . Don 't you get it yet ? I 'm just the tip of the iceberg . I 'm Good Cop . Look at you . So pleased with your grubby little murder . The fact is , when it comes to pure , naked evil , you 're an amateur . I want you to know you 've wandered off the path . This is where the wild things are , and we 've got your scent now . We can find you at the edge of the earth and create unimaginable tortures , and now I 'm going to tell you the very worst thing in the world , something only the dead know . That 's not true . I saw it . My advice to you ? Find a safe place with locks and bad dogs , and never ever turn out the light . I think I 'm going to go and put the kettle on . What did you say to him ? I told him a secret . 'So what happens now ? ' To me ? I thought there 'd be fireworks . I thought ... the clouds would part . I thought there 'd be Elvis . We just wait , I suppose . Wait ? And do what ? Well , the Real Hustle 's on at 8.30 . Is it ? If it 's a question of closure , well , what constitutes closure ? Owen turning himself in ? Doing himself in ? Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? I need you to keep me safe . OK . Have you been threatened by someone ? I killed my girlfriend . And now she lives with what I think is a werewolf and a vampire and they 're going to torture me . So I need to find somewhere safe . I see . Well , in that case we 're going to need a different form . Annie , those things you said to Owen , what happened ? I have never seen you like that before . Yeah , it 's funny what overcoming a whole army of vampires does to your confidence . I 'll see yous later . Er ... guys ... Oh , my God , it 's here . So that 's it ? That 's death ? Do I ... do I pack ? No . I mean , I don 't think so . I think you just go as you are . What is it ? On the other side , is it something good , or something else ? Probably something else . Then ... then why are you going ? It doesn 't make sense ! Stay . Please . Just , just stay . If you don 't know what 's there , why the hell are you going ? Because it 's an end . I should say goodbye now , then . Will you be all right ? Yeah , I 'll look after him . You hated me . I didn 't . Oh , you did . A bit . Don 't kill anyone . Good tip . Write that down . So ... So ... Yes . I 'll be off , then . Oh , this is ridiculous ! You 're lucky . Most people don 't get a chance to say goodbye . I know but ... fucking hell ! You might want to have different last words . George . When I open it , don 't look inside . OK . Oh , it 's cold . Aggh ! There 's someone at the door . It 's all right , it 's all right . It 's the other door ! What ? ! It 's the front door ! Oh , my bloody God ! I actually let out a little bit of wee there . Of all the times , there 's someone at the door now ? Maybe they 'll go away . Oh , this is absurd . We can 't do this with somebody at the door . Oh , no ! Ask me in ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Ask me in ! Oh , no ! Mitchell , tell me what to do . Do we take the stake out ? George he 's dying . You need to go . What ? We don 't know how long the portal will be here . Annie , this might be your only chance , Just go . But he 's dying ! George ! I 'll get him to the hospital . I can deal with this . Ambulance , please . Annie ... go ... Annie , just go !

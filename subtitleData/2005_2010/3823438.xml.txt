 It is always easier describing the end of a nightmare . The doorway in is more difficult to find . I guess in my particular case ... it began with a storm . Guys , guys , you gotta check this out ! It 's fogged-in everywhere , you can 't see 10 feet past your nose . It 's so surreal . What 's the matter ? It 's pea soup out there . Can 't even see the anchor at the end of the bow . Maybe we ought to call this in , captain ? Yeah , go ahead and give the position . I have to find a way to steer around this thing . You guys need a little fresh air , we knew there was going to be some weather , right ? Fresh air ? Yes , fresh air , it 's invigorating Frost , this is worse than the bungee jumping . What do you mean 'than the bungee jumping , ' you loved that ! - I cracked 2 ribs ! - But you bounced back , right ? He 's been looking like this for 2 weeks , I don 't think I can handle it ! I get no response . Not get anything at 16 . - Hey , Stack ? - What ? Check it out ! OK , OK , wait , you know what you need ? You need a little group photo . Do not you dare ask us to say ' cheese . ' You see ? That is the sense of humor that I 've been looking for . OK , on ' 3' now , ready ? 1 ... - What is it ? - 2 ... 3 . [ SOUND OF SEAGULLS ] Karen , sweetheart ... honey are you OK ? - Ross ? Oh , yeah , but I 've got a killer headache . What the hell happened ? Lindsey ? Well , it looks like we made it through the storm . - Storm ? - Where are we ? Captain ... what 's our position ? How far away are we San Juan ? Look , the electrical storm knocked-out my engine , I have no electricity and no radar . I have nothing ; the barometer is spinning around like a top . - I don 't know what 's going on . - Thanks . Hey , Cap 'n ! - Yup ? - We 're pretty much dead in the water . Well , might as well check engine , it 's probably something electrical . The reservoir cracked . Most of our fresh water drained-out before I could get down there to stop it . Barometer is all screwed-up too . Stack ... can we try to keep everything positive down there ? [ SIGHS ] Yes , sir . Land ! Thank You God ! What island is it ? You know what ? There shouldn 't be any land around here for miles . Well , maybe the storm blew us off course . Are you sure you don 't know our position ? It 's hard to tell with the instruments out . The instruments are out ? He said it 's difficult ... it 's not impossible . Stack 's working on getting the engine started . - Right , Stack ? - Yes , sir . - Go below . Anyway , it looks like the tide is moving us toward that island . Finally some good news . Well , the anchor 's set . I think she 'll hold . So , what do you say , we take the Zodiac and get some land under our feet ? [ TOGETHER ] Yay ! Yeah , I 'm in ! The main thing is we gotta replenish this water supply . Without that , we are not going anywhere . Maybe , we 'll bump into a pi√±a colada while we 're over there . - [ LAUGHS ] My time in the Boy Scouts did not leave me unprepared . [ EACH LAUGHS ] Frost ! - Yeah ? - Come here , I - I saw something . What ? - What ? - Like what ? - Right there in the water ... it was ... - Well , what did it look like ? - I-I don 't know , it was ... big ! - Like a whale ? - No . - Maybe it was a Manta ray . - No . Well , look , you know , I 'm-I 'm gonna stay here . Karen- - - What ? - I 'm just- - Wait , no , no , baby , It 's been a crazy night , you 'll be fine . - You don 't believe me . - Karen , don 't you want to get off the boat ? - Yeah , but ... - Wait , wait , wait , why don 't you stay here as well ? ... Both of you . No , no , I 'm going with you guys . Frikkin ' ' Jaws' couldn 't keep me from feeling sand between my toes . Alright , fine . I 'm gonna stay here with her . No , no , you go . I 'll be--I 'll be OK . Hey , you can let her stay , but I need every hand I can get . So , ' all ashore that 's going ashore ' . OK , I love you . Take care of yourself . I 'll be back in a little bit . - OK Careful ! You see this ? It is a flare gun . It 's loaded . Close it , cock the hammer , Put it above your head ... and fire . OK . We see the flare ... we 'll know you 're in trouble . What about if you guys have trouble ? Well .. we 'll just high-tail it back here as quickly as possible . 'A . S. A. P . ' [ WAVES BREAKING ] [ LAUGHING ] That 's more like it . No more boats , no more boats . [ SHE LAUGHS ] You guys go on ahead , we 'll ah ... - Here you go , Romeo . ... in a couple hours . - Come on . - I want to stay here . Come on , come on , we 're all standing . [ MUSIC ... ] You gotta remember where we came from . You see that , you see that gorge ? Nah , that 's your job . We need better luck . We need to see what 's going on around here . Hey , Stack ? Yeah ? Go aloft , would ya ; have a look around . Let me know which way we 're going . All right , Captain . I see why you keep him around . Stack grew up island hopping he 's more help than you can possibly imagine in an environment like this . Thanks for it . Whew ... All this work he 's doin is making me thirsty . Where the hell did he go ? - Thank you . - [ CHUCKLES ] He 's fine . [ SHOUING ] : Hell of a view from up here ! - Great-- Some birds , about half a click , due east . - Hang on ! - Well , that 's a good sign . Wildlife usually congregates near water . Hey , Stack , come on , down . We 're going to head that way . The flare ! What did he say ? - What ? The flare ! [ SKREECHING ] Aaah ... Stack ! - Oh , no- - Oh , my God ! [ SCREAMS ] Staaaack ! Lindsey ! ... Oh , shit ! Linds ... Lindsey ! Lindsey ! Lindsey ! Lindsey ! You can 't just run off off like that ! God ! What is it ? What the hell are those ? [ GROUND SHAKING AND ROAR ] Shit ! Move ! Yaah ! Come on , guys . Let 's try to stay together . Run . Go , go , go go ! Run where ? Where is it ? Where 's the boat ? The Zodiac is gone as well . It was right here ! - No ! Let 's just keep it down , OK ? Whatever 's in that jungle and laid those eggs is a pretty big- - We have to get off this island ! - Would you calm down ? - Karen took the boat ! Karen didn 't take the boat ! I think it broke free of the anchor . - The flag . - What ? The flare ! That 's what Stack was yelling at the top of the rock ... was the flare ! Ah ! ... Augh ! [ Roar ] We 're exposed out here . We gotta go to the trees . Get to the trees . We gotta go . - Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! - We 're all exposed out here , we gotta get in- - Come on ! Come on ! OK ! OK . This looks like a good spot , our backs are safe here . What about our friends ? - Honey ... - Don 't ' honey ' me right now ! - Just calm down , Linds . - I 've gotta get to the beach ... now , what are we doing here ? - What is this thing ? - What is this place ? - We can 't go back there ! Captain , where are we ? - OK Look ... I know we went past Haiti but we couldn 't have gone as far as San Juan . - San Juan ? San Juan ? I didn 't see any of those things that ripped your friend apart in the brochure for Puerto Rico . - Please . Please . What ? What ? This is all his fault . - We 'll figure something out- - - I 'm not listening to this bullshit , OK ? Just calm down , Lindsey . You stay here , and don 't you run away ! ... ... first place . She 's probably drifting on the anchor somewhere- - Let 's save our lives first . [ CHATTERING ] Take that , hold that , that 's it . - OK-- You and Lindsey stay put . The Captain and I will head-in and find the thing that took Stacks . No , no , no , we 're sticking together . We don 't know what 's out there , OK , I don 't want Lindsey to get hurt . - You alright ? - Yeah ... What if you don 't come back ? - We will . I want you to gather together anything you can that 'll burn . We 're gonna need a fire when it gets dark . I 'm not spending the night in this place . Lindsey , you remember when we were on that cross-country skiing trip and I broke my ankle ? You took my weight and got me down the mountain ? Yeah , you blacked-out for a moment . We 're back on that mountain , Linds . OK . I 'll be back . I could use some help here . Frost ... I 'm sorry about what I said . - What ? - About all this being your fault . It 's not all your fault . I mean it 's mostly your fault . That barometer wasn 't broken . What ? That barometer on the boat , it wasn 't malfunctioning . Frost , I really need you to pull it together here . That thing that took Stack ; it lived during the period of this planet 's history that had a much higher level of oxygen . High enough to support animals of that size . And bigger- - [ LOW GROWL ] Cole , that 's Tyrannosaurus . [ LOUD ROAR ] Frost , I want to go home . We gonna need a lot more firewood . - What do you think ? - Why don 't we just ... go around ? How long you known Frost ? - I don 't know ... 15 years ? - Oh , you guys are old buddies . We work together . Nice to know ... Well , if we get back ... you know ... to Key West ... Maybe you guys could come-up with ... a little more money ? Good luck . [ CHUCKLES ] Take it Fill it just over there . Cole ! Cole , check this out ! Cole ! Check it out ! [ LAUGHING ] Check it out , oh , that was amazing . That thing could carry me away . That was funny . You better ... ah , we better ... get back before dark . Got it . - OK . Hey , hey Cole , look , the coast is clear ! Got fresh meat . Ah ... look ... ah ... I think you should go . - Yeah , let 's go - Go on , go , yeah , go on- - I 'll watch , go ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Get a big piece . Oh , my God . ew- - [ LOUD ROAR ] Let 's get out of here ! Come on , Captain ! [ LOUD ROAR ] Oh , shit ! [ LOUD ROAR ] [ INDISTINGUISHABLE EXCLAMATIONS ] Get down , Get down . [ CRIES , EXCLAMATIONS , ROARS ] - What ? - Where did it go ? Maybe its hiding . Wait . No . No . No , wait . Maybe it 's hiding out there . No , no , come on . We can 't stay here . Why would it just leave ? [ LAUGHS ] - Oh , my God . - Too bad it didn 't stick around- - - What is this place ? Where are we ? [ BIRDS AND CRICKETS ] So what 's the plan , boss ? Well , we can just take turns keeping the fire lit . And in the morning , hopefully we find Karen . I 'm so hungry ... I could eat dinosaur . [ FORCED LAUGH ] I don 't think I 'm gonna sleep much in this place . [ HE SIGHS ] Don 't worry , we 're gonna find Karen . I hope so . I am so glad ... I am so ... I am so glad to be back in my bed . [ FIRE CRACKLING ] [ DREAM-LIKE MUSIC ... ] Aahh ! [ THUDS ] No bacon and eggs , but I 'm so hungry could eat a horse and save the jockey . Who are you ? Huh ? Oh , sorry , Mr. Sleepyhead . Guess you missed the introductions . I 'm Jude . Jude Jackson . This here is Joe . Not much of a conversationalist , but excellent listener . Where the hell are we ? That 's the 64 dollar question . When you drop down the rabbit hole , if you know what I mean ... . No place I ever heard of . Not even in flight school . How long you been here ? 1 year , 2 months and 11 days . Who 's counting , right ? Thank you . I 'll tell you too , it 's no easy task to survive around here . Making it through the day without becoming someone 's lunch is like ah ... having a date with the Andrews Sisters , you know what I mean ? [ LAUGHING ] That 's a good one ! We don 't get too many feminine types around here . There was one showed up about the time I got here but she didn 't last long . You must be the group that came in on the boat , right ? - The boat ? - You 've seen the boat ? Yeah , a boat 's kinda like an Easter Egg at an orphanage around here . Where ? It 's a little sticky . I don 't care how ' sticky ' it is , my wife 's on that boat ; I need to find it now . Just gettin to that boat is going to take everything you can muster . I 'll lead you right to it , can 't promise it 's still there , though . Can you go back ? That 's a whole ' nother ball game . Mind if I have another one of those ? Let 's go . You know ? It 's called ' survival of the fittest . ' I can 't believe you guys didn 't bring any firepower at all . You show-up with knives ? We weren 't- - We weren 't fighting a war . You can say that again ! This is where I dropped into our little island paradise . Broke an arm in the process . Hung up there like a Christmas ornament before anyone found me . That 's where I met Joe . [ JUNGLE BIRD CALLING ] Everything in here we collected from somewhere on the island . Kind of ... a little museum we put together . Shit ! Oh , this is Conrad . Conrad ... everybody . Hi ! - When are you from ? - What ? I 'm from Manhattan . - What year ? - Yeah ! I thought he was crazy too . He may be , and me with him . Conrad was skipper on a vessel called the " Connemora " You were on board the Connemora ? Damn fine vessel . Ah , she was recovered in 1955 . He 's been here for 54 years ? 10 years , 311 days . Hey , hey , smell that ? Smell that ? - Is that petrol ? - Bubbles-up right out of the ground . Conrad knows this place better than I ever will . You 'll guide us across ? Great . How far are we going to get with some crazy old man ? Hey , hey , hey ... may not be as crazy as you think . So Jude , where 'd you get the row boat ? Just like everything else , washed-up on the beach . Don 't know what happened to the people in it . You know , if you got a boat , why don 't you just use it to leave the island ? Making it past the breakers in something that small is impossible . Believe me , I tried , I almost became a snack for those big sons-a-bitches that live out in the deep . Well , wait a minute , what , what ? There she is . There is something that bothers me . What kind of plane was it that you said you bailed out of ? TBM Avenger , Flight 19 . Did you know that Flight 19 and that whole squadron disappeared in 1945 ? Yeah , 2 weeks before my 26th birthday . We had a hell of a party planned for when we got back to base too . Wait a second . OK , you were on Flight 19 and your friend was on the Connemora ? Affirmative . What ? We were traveling through what I always thought was a fictional zone . It 's known as the Devil 's Triangle . Wait , we went through the Bermuda Triangle ? I thought they disproved that . I thought it was like methane gas or something . Dude , we got dinosaurs . Flight 19 , the Connemora , well documented disappearances . Dude , we must have gone through some kind of doorway ... or something . Come on , we are wasting time . Let 's find Karen . On that thing ? It looks shitty , how do you know it will even float ? We will know . Believe me . Come on . Tie it tight ! [ ROAR ] [ SCREAMS ] No ! Cole ! Give me your hand ! - Where is he ? - What happened ? Go get it ! - There it is . - Come on ! - Give me your hand . - Come on . Help him ! - He will get it ! - Give me your hand ! - Come on . - Get him . What the fuck was that ? - Honey . - What was that ? Come on , let 's get out of here . - What was that ? - Are you okay ? Are You okay ? - I 'm OK . I 'm OK . - Can you keep going ? - Yeah . Yeah , let 's go . I think you ought to give your friend a minute to rest . - Why ? - He 's fine . - He 's fine , right , you 're fine ? - Yeah . We have to go get my wife and make sure she 's safe . Come on , let 's go . Let 's get the hell out of here , let 's move . Oh , my God . We 're gonna want to keep out of sight through this stretch . - Ok Keep the jibber-jabber to a minimum . That means our boat 's gotta be around here somewhere . It could be . Just keep your eyes skinned , and everything else shut . - Ok , Shh- - - Let 's go . Who the hell are they ? Germans . I don 't think they got the news we kicked their ass . [ LAUGHS ] They took over this whole side of the island as soon as they arrived . Let me go ! Karen ! - Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Relax , we make a plan , okay ? We don 't want to go rushing in there all willy-nilly ! - Let me go . - Conrad knows a way we can sneak-in behind ' em sus ' out their firepower . We 're gonna get your wife . Let 's go ! - All right ! Hey , you got any of that ' giggle juice ' left ? Yeah , good idea . Here . - What are you doing ? - We 're gonna need some illumination . 'Less you want to go in there blind . I 'm not going in there . Look , my friend here says that this cave comes in right behind the Jerries so , you can come with us , or you can stay here . But you 'll be by yourself . Everybody keep your head down and be quiet . [ SHRIEKS ] Lot of that goin ' around . It 's okay . It 's all right , Come on . Notice that . Shh . [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] [ SPEAKING IN GERMAN TO KAREN ] [ INTRODUCES SELF AS LONZO ] If we 're gonna get her out of here safely we 're gonna have to create a diversion . You know , draw ' em out of here somehow . Go ahead . Alright , here 's what we 're gonna do . Conrad and I are gonna get around to the front , create some sort of ruckus . The rest of you get in there and get her out , lickety split . There 's guns in there , so once she 's safe get what you can , so we can deal with the soldiers . I think I 'm gonna stay Conrad and Jude here and if I can get on my boat then I can prep her , we can make a fast getaway . Wait , wait , wait . What kind of diversion ? It 'll be something you won 't miss . OK , just be careful , OK ? Thanks . I 'm going to the back by Karen . [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] Cap 'n , stay here and watch the boat . We 'll be right back . [ SIGHS TO CATCH BREATH ] Lot of those Jerry bastards back there , huh Conny ? And guns as well . We need something ... to keep everybody busy , and that will give us a chance to take care of ourselves if you follow . How bad 's that gimpy old leg ? I could dance a jitterbug , if it would help me get on that boat . Want to have some fun ? Come on . Jesus ! [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] You better get yourself a start , Conny . I 'll be pretty good behind you . So run like a mean something , if you know what I mean . What are you waiting for ? - Shh ! [ WHISTLES ] [ DISTANT GROWLS ] Ye-ahh ! [ GROWL ] [ LOUD ROAR ] [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] Lukas ! [ GUN SHOTS ] [ GUN SHOTS CONTINUE ] [ THUD ] Ahh ... ! I 've been on this island too long to take the chance . We go out now , and let them kill each other . [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] Let 's go ! [ GERMAN ] [ SHOUTING ] : Hey , what are you doing ? [ GUNSHOTS ] [ GUNSHOTS CONTINUE ] [ LOUD ROAR ] They took my boat . Stop , Lonzo , stop . Run , the boat ... they 're taking my boat . Come on . They 're taking my boat ! They taking my boat ! [ ALL CHATTERING TOGETHER ] Hey ! What are you doing ? Hey ! [ LOUD WHISTLE ] Come back ! We can all go ! Come back ! Come back ! Come on . Shtopp ! Stops . [ CONTINUES IN GERMAN ] It 's just blood , man , it 's just blood . Hey , guys , this isn 't blood . [ GERMAN ] Hey , just because you yell , doesn 't mean I understand you , you Kraut bastard . They speak very little English , I 'm afraid . And I speak very little German , so I guess that makes us even . Touch√© . You speak pretty well . Even though I 'm a ' Kraut bastard ? ' I studied for 3 years at Cambridge University before the war begun . You know the war you fought in , it was over a long time ago . What do you mean the war is over ? Listen , you all came in on that submarine , right ? Myself and many others , as you saw in our graveyard . Listen , to me , there still may be a way for us to get out of here , I mean all of us . What are you talking about ? Eh ... stay back ... Old Conrad said there was oil here and that old T-Rex , he tracked it right in here . So ... if you find that old T-Rex that 's gonna be the only possibility we got of getting off this island . But we 're all gonna have to work together . First , we have a job to finish . [ RECITES ' OUR FATHER ' IN GERMAN ] Where you going ? I 'll be back . You stay right here ; I want you to be safe . What about you ? I 'll be back . Don 't go ! They are extremely dangerous from what we 've seen . We call him Sehrschrumpfe . It means ' scarred one . ' He 's had his share of fights . And the island is , more than half his territory . We have a particular regard for him as well . Watch your back . [ DISTANT ROAR ] Hey ! Oil . Zander , Zander . Oil . Hey . Hey . Hey , Frost . [ BUBBLING ] What would you say , right up there ? How fast ? - Ah , so fast ! Oh , yes , this is good . - Faster ! [ IN GERMAN ] Shh ! Shh ! Sehrschrumpfe ! Oh , shit ! Come , come . Come on . OK , let 's go ! [ LAUGHING ] Come on ! Come on ! Go , go , go , go , go ! [ ALL BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ LAUGHING ] What now what , Captain ? Now ... Now ... Now ... [ LAUGHTER ] Okay . Well , if this doesn 't work , we can always use it to make moonshine . You 're not that far off . No , actually , you add heat to petroleum , it breaks down its components . Jet fuel on top , asphalt on the bottom . You got your methane , you got your kerosene . Gasoline , and you got your ... Diesel ! We 're going to put the petroleum in here . Theoretically , we are going to add heat . The petroleum distills , and travels through this copper coil . Down here , through here , and it 's going to end-up in this cooling reservoir . Obviously , we don 't have a lot of control of the heat , so do I have to explain to any of you what happens when petroleum gets like really , really hot ? Pcheeew ! Exactly . So I think we gotta give this place a lot of room . And I think we should work in 2 minute shifts . And that starts right now . Pick a partner . - So , everything is ready . - Lonzo . Guys . Guys . Danke sh√∂n ... . We had to move this thing away from the camp and now we are completely exposed to , like everything . You know , maybe , maybe you might want to go with the others at least until I 'm- - I 'm sure that this thing works . We make sure together . Wow . Ja , wow . [ WAVES CRASHING ] [ GERMAN ] All Right ... . You got the honors . May God be with us . Yes With music anything is bearable , even weeks below the ocean . [ CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYS ] What would it take to get that submarine to run again ? It would take many more gallons than we use for this small generator . Well , suppose that we could get the fuel ? Some basic repairs . Judging from the moon , the tide is gonna peak in about , umm , 2 weeks . You want us to try and sail away on a submarine ? It might be the best opportunity we have . First we have one large problem to deal with . The Schrumf raptor - Sehrschrumpfter Isn 't that what I said ? Shurschrampter . - I understand . It 's okay . [ PHONOGRAPH MUSIC CONTINUES - VIENNESE WALTZ ] Why don 't we hunt the T-Rex like we do other animals ? We tried . Our firearms do very little damage , especially at a safe range . Wounded , they only become that much more dangerous . It would take a cannon to bring them down . How long will it take to get the big son-of-a-bitch ? [ GUNSHOT AND ECHO ] You know ... I got an idea . When I was a kid , my dad used to use M-80 's , you know , ' cherry bombs ? ' ... to scare the deer out of the hay fields . Now , I know scarring a T-Rex is a hell of a lot more dangerous ... than trying to run a white-tail out of a hayfield , but ... we can use whatever gunpowder , smoke , explosives , any thing we can put together that makes a big noise , we got a chance . We just gotta take a tip from our primitive ancestors . You know , how they used to push Mammoths off the edge of cliffs ? We would do the same thing . Using our explosives to drive the T-Rex through the ravine , ... somehow , away from his lair and all that petroleum , and onto the beach . There is only one thing on this island that can bring down something as big as that ... We have to be lucky , precise . But if we do , we 'll have access to all the petroleum we could ever use . We just have one problem , how do you get the T-Rex started in the first place ? He 's right . You use the explosives to initially drive him from his lair you set that petroleum on fire . We 're never gonna make it . That 's true . Getting him out will be my job . Come on , you big ugly lizard . [ LOUD ROAR ] [ ROAR AND HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ] Lonzo , now ! [ EXPLOSION AND ROARS ] [ EXPLOSION AND ROARS ] [ EXPLOSION AND ROARS ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ GERMAN ] [ EXPLOSIONS ] Hey ! Hey , keep coming ! Lindsey ! Now ! [ SCREAMS ] [ LOUD ROAR ] No , Cole ! No Cole ! [ SCREAMS ] Come on ! - Come on ! - Nooo ! [ ROAR ] [ EXPLOSION ] Hey . I know that you want to be alone right now , but you have to be careful walking around here by yourself , it 's dangerous . He was the only one in this whole world who made me feel like I wasn 't alone . I don 't know , I just I can 't believe he 's gone . It doesn 't make sense to me . It 's not fair but he 's opened the door for us , Linds ; just like he 's always done . Everybody has to work hard for us to pull this off . You have to do your part . I need you for this . You 're not alone . I 'll wait for you outside . [ WAVES BREAKING ] We 're gonna have to dig , We 're gonna have to dig , dig , dig . I mean it 's going to take a lot of digging . We gotta remove sand from the base of the hull at the bow , all the way to the stern . [ GERMAN ] He said , he would dig to Hades itself , if it meant getting back to his girlfriend . So , if we can remove enough sand , and get enough water under the base of the hull , high tide , we should be able to slip her free ... off this sand , and get her outside With the engines running , we could empty the ballast tanks , make her more buoyant . Um , his girlfriend ... she ... ah she may have gotten really old . She may ... even be dead . It 's a different world than the one you left . I have a wife and child of my own . There are many great mysteries , Captain . We must not lose the opportunities that others have given us . Lonzo , Lukas , faster ! You got an extra shovel ? [ BUBBLING ] [ GERMAN ] [ GERMAN ] ( You did a good job big man , yes , Frost , a good job , yes ? ) [ LAUGHS ] Yeah ... yeah ! Oh , my God . - All right , I think I can handle it , let me just show you something . Frost , Frost , here , here . [ FIRE CRACKLING ] Come on . [ SIGHS ] Can we make it on time ? Yeah , yeah , I think so . It 's gonna take a lot of fuel . We 're gonna need every drop once we slip her off the sand and get her out to sea . We are only gonna get one chance , when we blow those ballast tanks . [ SIGHS ] Other than that , I wouldn 't worry about it . [ WAVES BREAKING ] All the supplies are loaded ; food , water , everything we can think of . Listen Frost , once we blow the ballast tanks , there 's no turning back . We got it . It 's high tide now , it 's ... we got 30 minutes ! But they are bringing the fuel right now . Get them on the boat ! We just have to hope that what we have right now is going to be enough fuel . The tide waits for no one , man . [ GERMAN ] [ BUBBLING ] [ ROAR ] [ THUNDEROUS FOOTSTEPS ] [ FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE ] [ GUNSHOTS ] [ ECHO OF GUN SHOTS ] [ ROAR ] [ GERMAN ] [ GUNSHOT ] [ SHOT THEN EXPLOSION ] High tide , it 's now or never . Let 's get the boat off the sand . Blow the tanks ! Blow the ballast ! Wait . Wait , wait , they 're not back yet . Lonzo ! Come . [ GERMAN ] ( WHAT 'S WRONG ? ) Lonzo ! We have to go to the submarine . Come on ! [ GROUND-SHAKING FOOTSTEPS ] Well , fire the engines ! [ GERMAN ] [ GERMAN ] [ ENGINE WHINES ] We got reverse ! [ ROAR ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ ALL EXCLAIMING ] We did it ! What ? What did he say ? Frost may not have made it back . I think we lost him . - Karen ! Karen ! - She was--she was just here a minute ago . Frost . Hey . You okay ? It 's too late , it 's gone . Why weren 't you on it ? Not without you . [ FIRE CRACKLING ] I may never know whether the attempt was successful and the submarine was able to escape this place . Maybe , someday , others will come here , just as we did , ... and we can hope again . In the meantime , life continues to move forward . Time passes , even in this wild place , forgotten by the world . We 've managed to make a home . As I end my story , and send it out to whatever fate it may find , it reminds me that we are always at the beginning . God bless us on this journey . Frost Michaels .

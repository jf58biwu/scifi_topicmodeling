 It 's so freaking hot . You mean hot as in like Eden-hot ? Because Eden 's - This place gives new meaning to the word hot . I should have transferred to the University of Minnesota when I had the chance . And now we 've been paying for that decision ever since . - I 'd hit you , but I 'm too hot . - Yeah ? I wanna be just like her when I grow up . Don 't worry , you 'll get there . Maybe I should pledge a sorority this semester . Get plied with alcohol , forced to wear next to nothing then be degraded by simpletons who think they 're cool . - But they 're not . - They 're not ? - No , they 're not . - They 're not . You guys are so weird . We can go to that bar on the other side of the cemetery that lets anybody in . How about this ? I 've got my fake ID . We go buy some beer ... - ... we bring it back to the dorms . - Your fake ID 's never worked . Why would it suddenly start working now ? - Okay . - Guys this is a truly tragic state of affairs . I really didn 't think it 'd be this much work to have fun in college . We can hit a movie , you guys , cool off . - What about bowling ? - Good idea . What are we , 43 ? Hey , guys , all I have to say is that this is a really sad , sad day in history . Hey , party people . Slow it down . Check this out , all right ? This way , underground rave . Cool people . Good times . Lots of liquor . My name 's right there . Call me , okay ? If you have any questions . Hey , man ! Make sure you bring her . Boys , it 's time to get this party started . Enjoy it , guys . - Man , these freaking mosquitoes . - Stupid mosquitoes . And there 's a party out here in the middle of nowhere . Yes , dude , that 's the whole underground part of it , okay ? - I mean , just relax . - Jeez ! - Mosquito . - My God . - Bloody . - Oh , thanks . Appreciate it . Great party , Mickey . This reminds me of a party I went to in high school . - Where 's the beer ? - Hey , hold up . No beer only planter 's punch . Ten bucks buys a cup and all you can drink . - I 'll work with that . - You guys good ? Good . - Yellow for you . - Thanks . - Thank you , sir . - Thank you . - Pink for you . - You 're purple . - Yes . - Enjoy , guys . - Let 's do it . - Have fun . - Thanks , man . - All right . - All right , all right . - Here we go . - To liquor , at last . - Right . You know we 're perfect for each other , Eden . - Oh , my - Aaron ! - What ? - You 're like my brother . - What ? Brother ? - Yeah , you 're not perfect for anybody . - What 're you - ? Anybody ? What about , what about , what about - ? Okay , what about you ? You . - No . - No ? I 'm scowling out ... Where is everyone ? Aaron ! Eden ! Aaron ! Aaron ! - Here you go , pumpkin pie . - I want pancakes . Well , you can 't have pancakes , it 's too hot . Mama 's not turning on the stove . Sweetheart , you know what ? What do you say we do have those pancakes ? Violet . - Morning . - Hey . Good morning , Rami monster . Morning , Violet . And good morning to you , Professor Rierdon . - Professor Dryer . - All set for another semester ? No . When are the renovations done on our air-conditioned dream house ? Three , four months , tops . Four months in this rental from hell ? Oh , come on , it 's fine . I mean it 's hot , but it 's fine . It 's more than the heat . Every time I go to find something it 's in a box . It 's just not our home . It 's just temporary , sweetie . You gotta relax . - Where 's Nidia ? - Guatemala . - Guatemala ? - Sick aunt . We have classes in an hour , Maddy . What are we supposed to do ? - No milk . - All right , I 'm gonna call my sister . - All right ? - Whoa , whoa , hang on , buster . I got a better idea . You take Rami to class and I 'll take Violet . The students will love it . You just don 't want my sister watching the kids , right ? If she just looked after the kids , that would be fine . Do you remember when my father was in the hospital ? - She rearranged the furniture . - It 's just furniture . So what ? In every room of the house . She 's like an over-caffeinated Mary Poppins . She 's my sister , all right ? She 's just trying to help , Maddy . It 's just , we 're very different people . - Here , sweetheart . - I thought that we came down here so that we could be closer to family . To have help in situations like this . Yes , we said that . I thought we moved here for a simpler life . I 'm still waiting . I 'm calling my sister . She 'll be here in 10 minutes . I 'm here . Y 'all can relax . Look who 's here . - Dan . Hi , Sparky . - Thanks for coming , Shell . - Thank you , thank you . - What are big sisters for ? Ever since I kicked Stan out on his sorry butt , I 've got nothing but time . - Hey , darling . Madeleine . - Hi , Shelly . - Hi . - We appreciate the assist . Sure . You girls must have worked up some immune system living in this kitchen and eating out of here . Don 't you guys have classes to teach ? Go , I got everything . We 're fine . Bye . Go . I got everything . Go , go . Hi . Now , first , I 'm gonna feed everybody some really good food . Normal food . Okay , girls , be good for Auntie Shelly . Wait , wait , wait . Keys . I don 't have car seats . - You don 't want your car trashed . - Got that , Sparky . Okay , guys , bye-bye . Bye-bye . See you later . - Come on , Spanky . - Sparky . Yeah , whatever . - You have a good first day , sweetheart . - You too . I 'll pick you up later . I 'll be the one at the helm of the Love Boat . - Don 't kiss too many co-eds . - Hey , no promises . Excuse me , teacher coming through . Ladies and gentleman . Good . This is E-Bio 205 , Ecosystem Ecology . You lucky individuals will be having an in-depth examination of ecosystem structure and function . Sorry I 'm late , everybody . The morning from hell and all that stuff . Hey , Don and Jossie . Still joined at the hip . That 's nice . And , Lizzie , I missed you . Did you miss me ? Good to see that you 've claimed the back corner again . We will also be considering the human impact on the ecosystem . Any questions ? Yeah , are you seeing anybody ? Well , as a matter of fact , I am happily married with two kids . How unfortunate . Right ? Okay , now you 're scaring me . All right , why don 't we get down to saving the environment ? Everybody , open up your texts , please . First chapter ... - Oh , hey , guys , this is a nice surprise . - Sorry we 're late . I didn 't scare you off last semester . That 's good . Hi , Professor Rierdon . You know , I 'm hot just looking at you both in all those clothes . And you are ... ? I 'm Miles . Miles Wallach . Miles Wallach . You know , I bought that exact outfit for my husband from the J.Crew catalogue . I thought this was Bio 311 , not Fashion Victim 101 . Yes , it is . So let me get to know the rest of you . - Jessica Bowers . - Here . Marilyn ... Hello . Who would you be ? - Keith Cline . - Keith Cline . Leave the tunes at home ... - ... we 'll get on much better . - Enemy of fun . - Michael Zoellick ? - Yeah . Lizzie , Jossie , Don , gotcha . Jason Ortiz ? That 's funny . He didn 't miss a class all last semester . Well , welcome to Bio 311 , Animal Behaviour and Evolutionary Biology . So anyway , last I heard he 's doing three years down in State . Well , I 'm not surprised , considering how he was in school . When he was 11 years old , he almost burned his house down . Yeah . Anyway , I found them on the property when I was doing a swamp tour . The fifth time this week . My customers don 't come out here to see dead wildlife , Jay . Yeah . No , I realize that , Dil . Definitely attacked by something , that 's for sure . Must have been more than one of whatever it was . To get two deer . Well , what you gonna do about it , Jay ? I mean , I got a business to run here . - I 'll file a report . - If you don 't , I will . Oh , I will . Don 't worry . I 'll take care of it . Well it 's raining . Let 's get back on in . - It 's quiet . - It 's too quiet . - Who lives here ? - Not us . - It 's freaky . - I 'm starving I 'm gonna make some soup . You want some ? - Soup in this weather ? Are you crazy ? - I 'm not gonna heat it . Dan , get in here . - What ? - She did it again . She rearranged my kitchen cabinets . I like my mess , Dan . Because I can find whatever I want , even if it 's in a box . - But this I cannot deal with . - Hey , Shell . - Hi , Dada . - Hello , sweetie , hello ! Go see Mommy . Mommy . Give me , give me , give me . - What can 't you deal with , Madeleine ? - It 's nothing . It 's the heat , the house . - So how was everybody 's day ? - Good . They were so sweet . Yeah ? Oh , thanks again , Shell . We really owe you one for helping out . I 'm glad to do it . Y 'all can take care of me when I 'm old . Love you . - See you later . - Bye , Shelly . Man , it 's as hot as Hades here . How do you people stand this ? Somehow we people seem to manage just fine . We 're just about set . Watch out for gators , now . Gators ? Where are you going ? Well , thought we might want this . We are going night fishing . You make a fair point , Popeye . All right , look out , fishies , here we come . My life in the ocean wave , eh ? Rum , buggery and the lash . - Hey , sheriff . - Hey , Chip . So , what do we got here ? Well , a woman walking her dog stumbled onto the body . I don 't know who walks their dog in a place like this . Well , people do all kinds of things for all kinds of crazy reasons . - Hey , Gary . - Hey , sheriff . His name 's Jason Ortiz . He 's a sophomore . Been missing since yesterday . We 'll need to alert the university and his parents . What the hell ? Yeah , his body 's pretty messed up . - I can 't tell if he 's been strangled . - He wasn 't strangled . There 's not a lot of blood there . What 's up ? Don 't know . Can 't be sure till we get him down to the coroner . - Roy ! - Yeah ? Meanwhile , you get back to the university . - Find out who he hung out with . - Right . When are we gonna catch something ? They call it fishing , not catching , Homer . Breaker , breaker 1-9 . Breaker , breaker 1-9 this is Live Bait . Come on , fishes . Come out here and let us catch you . Come on , little fishy-wishy . Do me a favour and make yourself useful and turn that thing down . Smooth move , Homer . Now you scared all the fish into the next county . We ought to just pack up and go home . Look , I don 't pay you $ 200 so I can catch no fish and get attitude , okay ? Hey , wait a minute . I think the fish is heeding my call . - Is that your line or mine ? - I ain 't got nothing . I think I 've got a nibble . What 's that ? Hand me your lantern . What is that ? This is the brown shrimp . There was a time when you couldn 't set foot into the Gulf of Mexico without stepping on one . But now you have to go 60 miles offshore to find any at all . - Why ? What happened to them ? - Pollution , fertilizers run off into the Mississippi . This washes out into the Gulf creating a hypoxic zone the size of New Jersey . - Take a look at that . - I 'm sorry , a what ? A hypoxic zone . It 's a dead zone . It 's when the chemicals in the water deplete the oxygen which prevents the growth of aquatic life . Very good , Eden . Hypoxic zones have become one of the most widespread and accelerating of all man 's assaults on the world 's marine environments . Not to mention over-fishing . Commercial fishermen have repor - Excuse us , ma 'am . Just a second , everyone . Yes , sheriff ? Do you have an Aaron Edelman and an Eden Barclay ? - Aaron - Yeah . - Those two ? - You-all need to come with me . - Why ? - We 'll explain it later . - Excuse me . - What ? What - ? - Let 's go . - Get your hands off me . - Let 's go , young lady . - We didn 't do anything . - Yeah . - What 's the problem ? - Jason Ortiz was found murdered . - What ? - They were the last ones with him . - What ? What did he say ? - Stop , man . Just bringing them in for questioning . - Professor , what 's going on ? - All right , class dismissed , everybody . - But wait a minute . - What are we - ? - I can 't disrupt the investigation . - I 'm not asking you to disrupt them . Things like this don 't happen in Mercier . - Hello . - Hello , professor . - You know Mayor Poelker . - Call me Hank . - Rierdon teaches at the university . - Nice to know you . Can I talk to you ? I am not at liberty to discuss the investigation at this time . I know these kids . They couldn 't have anything to do with Ortiz 's death . - They were great friends . - When it comes to murder , professor it 's always the people you least expect . What if you 're wrong ? Mayor Poelker , do you wanna be the one to call Tate students murderers ? Professor Rierdon there 's evidence . What evidence ? - Go ahead . - On Wednesday evening , the 24th the accused attended some kind of underground party on the same property where the deceased was discovered . They can 't be the only ones at the party . What do you mean , underground ? Step into my office . Come on in . Have a seat . By underground , I mean a bunch of kids engaged in illegal activities : Drugs , underage drinking , trespassing which appear to have culminated in the ritualized murder of Jason Ortiz . - Oh , come on - - Professor , just ... - Let him finish . - Witnesses saw the victim arrive with the accused . And later that night calls were made by the accused back to their dorm to a friend down the hall . Carla ? Oh , my God . Carla , pick up . Please , pick up . I 'm with Aaron . We 're so messed up . I don 't even know where we are . You 've gotta help . Something happened to Jason . Eden , shut up , okay ? Shut up , Eden . Okay , we gotta go . We gotta go . They 'll find us . - I don 't see how that implicates them . - Friends finally found them two towns over , wandering aimlessly . - Well , what does this prove ? - We also ran DNA tests . Both kids had the victim 's blood on their clothing . All three had trace remnants of Ecstasy in their systems . - Stupid kids . - Well , it 's a problem on campus . I mean , this drug can cause kids to become completely psychotic . That doesn 't make them murderers . No , the fact that they drained their friend of blood makes them murderers . Say that again ? The Ortiz kid has deep lacerations all over his neck and face . Okay , what kind of lacerations ? We 're not sure yet . Possibly bite marks . I 'd like to examine the body . Please . Look , I have a Ph. D. in animal behavioural biology . If these are bite marks , I can help you identify them . All right . I 've never come across anything like it . And that 's saying a lot . He was a good kid . I 'm sorry . - May I ? - Please . Well , you definitely were right . They 're some kind of bite . - Not human , though . - No , they would have made a bigger dental impression . Can I have your callipers ? Thank you . What do you make of these larger marks ? Would suggest an animal with fangs . Something smallish . But these marks on either side of the larger ones are throwing me . What do you think ? I 'm not sure . Whatever it was , there was more than one . These marks aren 't uniform . They 're all different . Just wait a minute , now . I mean , what do you mean , you 're not sure ? I don 't know what kind of animal made these marks . The only thing you can be sure of is that those kids didn 't do this . Would you let me talk to them ? Yeah , yeah , fine . Talk to them . Come with me . - So ? - It was the punch , professor . It was spiked with something . - Ecstasy ? - Well , you never have to remind us ... - ... never try that again . - See , here 's the thing . The police claim that they found Jason Ortiz 's blood on your clothes . What ? There 's no way . No . Blood ? The mosquitoes . - What about them ? - It has to be the mosquitoes . - I swatted him , and then I rubbed - - Yeah , yeah . We were swatting mosquitoes off of each other like crazy . Professor Rierdon , we were drugged but we would have never hurt Jason . He was our friend . There 's no way . You have to believe us . I do believe you . We 're gonna get you guys out of here . I promise . - We need a location for Saturday . - I hear you , dude . If we don 't start publicizing this party , we 're hosed . Do you know how many chicks we 're gonna meet if we throw a major campus party ? Not to mention all the bank we 're gonna be rolling in . Amigos , I found it . I 'm telling you . - Primo . - For what , man ? The party . Stop staring at me . - Stop staring at me . - You wish , bro . - All right . - Make sure nobody 's coming , man . - Dude , dude , what are you doing ? - This is the spot . It 's open . Help me with this . - Cool . - Nice . All right , guys , let 's go . Quickly . Follow my lead . - After you . After you . - When in Rome ... Today 's the day we 're gonna rave Going to the party We all get paid - All right , I saw something . - It 's kind of hot in here . Yeah , man , I mean , it is , like , a steam tunnel . Wait till you see this . I 'm telling you . I 'm waiting . Let 's go , fellas . Holy crap . This place is fantastic , man . Come on , man . - Where are we , exactly ? - The coffee factory . - What the - ? - Watch your back , man . Give me some room . Watch out . - So , what do you think ? - It smells kind of rank . Oh , Wayne . We just need to clean some of this gunk off the floor . All right , hold it , hold it , guys . The acoustics in here are sick , man . Listen , I think all we need is some track lighting along this wall , right ? And then some old sofas or something over there . Put the couch there . Put the DJ booth there . Then we got it . Bring extra speakers , in case ours get fried . - Write that down . - This is gonna rock . - Oh , yes , my brother . - Wayne , make some fliers . Roof 's on . That 's progress . A kitchen and carpet would be progress . - This is taking forever . - Come on , what 's wrong ? I just can 't ignore the fact that those kids are in trouble . You know , the police can handle it , honey . They 're my students . I know , but you can 't save everyone , right ? - They 've got parents . - Yes , they have parents . - But their parents aren 't here . - They should be . Don 't forget , we got two kids of our own that need you . The windows are in . Means they 're gonna start dry-walling soon . They 're gonna finish the painting - Don 't you insinuate that I 'm not here for our kids , okay ? Because we have changed our entire lives so that I can be here with the girls . I know , I know , honey . I didn 't mean it like that . After the locust thing I thought we were through with life-or-death situations . Yeah , we are , and ... - You know what would be really good ? - What ? Just to be out here under the trees with a big old margarita in our hands . Yeah , it may not look like it but we 're in the home stretch now , honey . What 's that ? What ? Oh , it just looks like somebody 's boat came untied . I 'll see if I can find a dock hook . - Oh , my God , Dan . - What ? - Bring it in . - Oh , my God . Oh , my God . I 'm gonna call 911 . - Call the sheriff 's office ! - Yeah . Hurry ! - Sheriff , you 've gotta release them . - Professor , this is an investigation . The fishermen 's wounds are identical to Jason Ortiz 's . Clearly , my students had nothing to do with his death . Come on , they were in your jail when this happened . I think the lady 's right , sheriff . We 've come across a lot of deer of late . Same kinds of wounds . Right here on the bayou . Warden Schuster , Department of Fish and Game . - Professor Rierdon . - How do you do ? Pleasure . What the hell 's going on around here ? I don 't know . The body was drained of blood , like the Ortiz kid . Okay , let 's autopsy these guys . If you 're gonna do that you should autopsy the deer that Warden Schuster found . Mayor Poelker , you should alert people to what 's going on here before someone else gets hurt . - I think that 's a good idea . - No . No , no , no . I 'm not gonna send out a panic over some incidents out here in this bayou . Come on , now , we 've got Fish and Game involved in this . Police are on this 24I7 . No need for hysteria . Yet . Hey , what 's that on his shirt ? Could be anything . They 've been out here for a while . Looks like dirt . It 's guano . Guano ? Bat droppings . - Hi - Thank you . Honey , we 're home , yay . - Honey , I 'm home . - Yay , home . - Great , Rebecca . - My sisters . Sisters , yay . - Wait , no , don 't leave . - Okay . I know . Have fun , okay ? - She 's all yours . Good luck . - Hey , guys . Thanks . That girl 's a special case . Open door . Oh , I love you , sisters . Sisters , sisters . Here , you can have that . - I 'll sit here . - Okay . Come on . Guys , I can do that . I 'm fine . I 'm all right , I 'm okay , I 'm okay . - Here , we 'll help . - See , see ? One , two - See ? Good . - You guys go . - Okay . Good night . - Bye . - Bye , guys . Beddie , beddie , beddie . Sleep , sleep . - Oh , boy . - Well , hi , Poelker . - Hey , Shelly . - Hey . - Hey . - What you doing ? It 's nice you got time to buy toaster strudel and prune juice while there 's a murderer running loose . Shelly Dryer , you know , you shouldn 't put your nose where it don 't belong . Somebody 's gotta keep you honest . Where have you been for the last 25 years ? It 's Shelly Beaudraux , thank you . Shelly Beaudraux . Well , excusez-moi , mademoiselle . You know . You know what gets me ? How the biggest weasel in high school got to be mayor . How did that happen ? Shelly , excuse me . I got business to attend to . All right . Faculty party on a riverboat ? You 're supposed to be able to make an appearance and then take off . - I know . Hey . - Hi . - You 'll be fine . Trust me . - My shoes are killing . - Oh , are they ? - Good to have you . - Hey there . - Professor Rierdon , Dan . Hank . Long time , no see . It 's good to see you under better circumstances . Yeah . Hey , this should be fun . Oh , yeah . - Everybody loves a three-hour tour . - Play nice . And then after that we went to Suriname ... - Thank you . - ... where Michael , Dr. Philips , and I were working with the Surinamese government on a fascinating project studying the intraspecial relations of the Asian wood owl in the region . You know , they 've suffered a serious population decline there . Yeah , I think I read that report , actually . Dr. Kason , what do you know about bat attacks here in Louisiana ? Bat attacks in Louisiana ? No , that 's unheard of . We only have the tiny pipistrelle bat and some of the Mexican free-tailed bats but they wouldn 't hurt a fly . Well , I take that back , actually . That 's exactly what they 'd hurt . They 're insect-eaters , so they would hurt a fly . They 'd eat the fly . Oh , excuse me . A department head 's work is never done . - Gotta take this . I 'll be back . - Take your time . Dr. Kason here . Yes . How did she get to be the head of the department ? How do students stay awake ? Where 's your phone ? I wanna call Shelly . No , she 's gonna be fine . She 'll have had the kids in bed long ago . You know , she did raise four kids of her own , you know . All right . Besides , I 'm deeply fascinated by ... What was that ? The wood owl ? The cinnamon wood owl . - Cinnamon - - I 'm gonna go spike the punch . - All right . - Let 's go . - Hey , Keith . - Hey , Lizzie . You made it . - How you doing ? - Good . No , no , no . They 're with me , man . - They 're with me . Go ahead . - You gonna be here all night ? - I 'll be out there in just a minute . - Cool . Go on . - Yeah . - Yeah ? Let 's go . Welcome to my office . Check it out . You can 't get that stuff in Kentucky , boy . Yeah ? Yeah , all right . Let 's see the green , man . - Forty . - Good man . Enjoy , all right ? Yeah ? Hey , I 've been looking for you everywhere . Bambi . Okay . See , I told you this would beat the crap out of some lame old frat party . Let 's kick it up a notch , shall we ? You look amazing . Are you gonna teach me how to spin later or what ? I 'll teach you how to spin now . How 's that ? All aboard ! Mickey ? Mickey . He 's out of it . Let 's go dance . - Your work is truly fascinating . - Well , it 's my life . I can 't imagine doing anything else . I can . What was that ? Oh , just the breeze rustling the paper bags on the lights . - No , really - - Dan , hold this . - You okay ? - Yeah . There 's something in the ... What was that ? Okay , everybody , can I have your attention ? We 've got an emergency . I need you to move downstairs quickly . - What 's going on ? - It 's an emergency . I need you to get downstairs under cover . - Maddy ? - Leave your plates and glasses move downstairs - Hank , help me ! Everybody , get down inside . We do need to get downstairs . Holy crap . They 're freaking bats . Wayne ! Wayne ! Get down here ! Please , please , please . - You gotta get under cover . - Everybody , just keep moving . Keep moving downstairs . - Don 't panic . - Keep together . Cover your heads . This is most unusual . Everybody , keep moving . Inside ! Get these people out of here . I 'm gonna find Mickey . Get under cover inside ! This is just amazing . - You can 't hide there . Get inside ! - Everyone , inside ! Dan ! " Horrifying " and " surreal " was how the scenes were described as vampire bats attacked separate functions in Mercier Saturday night . A Tate University student was killed in the melee . And as you can see behind me concerned parents aren 't taking any chances . As local police and Fish and Game authorities investigate residents watch , wait and wonder when and where the next attacks might occur . Reporting from Tate University , I 'm Veronica Mossgrove . Step aside , folks . Do something . Calm down , just for one minute . Please . Where are the bats coming from , and why are they attacking people ? Well , we are trying to determine that right now . In the meanwhile , I 'm gonna institute a mandatory curfew . A curfew ? That 's not gonna help anything . - You can 't shut everything down . - Calm down . It 's just for a little while . Everything is in control . Just listen to me . No one is to be out on the street from dusk till dawn . That 's insane . I own a bar . I 'll lose my business . Wait a minute . Now , I know all of you are worried . But the Department of Fish and Game is dealing with this problem and working on a plan to rectify the situation ASAP . All right . There you go . Now , listen - This is bad . Please , if you have any questions - If you have any questions - I care about each and every one of you . Frances here will take your name and number . I will get back to you personally . You have my word . What do you got ? So , mayor , what 's your plan ? We 're working on it . You don 't have a plan , do you ? We may not all be into academia , professor , but that does not mean that we don 't have some good old-fashioned common sense . - We 're gonna poison them . - So you think this will kill them all ? Unless threatening them works . What , you have a better idea ? I mean , you are a biologist , professor , aren 't you ? - What 's your plan ? - I don 't believe you can kill them all . Is there a way to drive them back into the bayou ? There 's not enough prey in the bayou . That 's why they 're here . Right , for a feast of people . We 'll find a way to get rid of them . Right . So we have to capture them . Study them . - Find out why they 're exhibiting - - How many will die while we do this ? The mayor 's right , ma 'am . These bats are too aggressive to be around populated areas . Clearly . Now , how you planning on doing this , Schuster ? I 'm gonna put poison on their wings . See , bats are groomers . Clean each other by licking . So out of the course of an evening a single bat could be licked by 20 to 25 other bats . And the bats are covered in poison . The others lick it and they die ? Precisely . - So we still need to capture some . - Yes . With all due respect , even if the poison works killing 25 , even 2500 of these things isn 't gonna put a dent in the potential problem we have . These bats are aggressive . Something is causing this . I think it 's something environmental . Like ... ? I wish I knew . But we have to find their lair and that 's easier said than done . You know , I am not interested in any more problems . What I want , Schuster , I want solutions . Kill them . End of story . Mayor - - Oh , my God . Bats ? Did you freak ? - Did I freak ? I totally freaked . Nothing like my knight in shining armour . You were running around like you were on fire . Don 't give me that . - Whatever . - Lizzie . You 're vertical . - See you guys later . - Okay . Innocent until proven guilty . Welcome back . I wanted to talk to you about what 's been going on because it 's applicable to what we 're studying . The fact that we have killer vampire bats on campus ? They look like vampire bats , but they sure don 't act like them . - What do you mean ? - For starters their natural habitat is from South America up through Mexico . Not only do they not belong here , but their behaviour is absolutely bizarre . Why would they suddenly be in Mercier ? Changes in the environment , loss of habitat and other man-made influences . Like what ? In South America , they 've seen far more incidents of bats coming into populated areas due to things like deforestation . Everybody needs a home , right ? So it makes sense that if you destroy an animal 's natural habitat they 're gonna have to adapt to another one . What 's unusual about these bats is that the bite marks are inconsistent with what we know about the species . Bats , and vampire bats in particular , have gotten a bad rap over the years . They 're not killers . They 're more like parasites . They may feed off cattle 's blood , but they don 't generally kill them . Then why are they killing people ? That 's what we need to find out . If everybody would open up your text to page 115 . Today we 're gonna begin our discussion on the ecosystem of freshwater stream environments , including the physical forces affecting water flow , sediment build-up including ecosystem structure and environment . We will also be factoring in - Rebecca ? All right . Hold on , everybody . - Okay , call 911 right now ! - Is she all right ? - Hey , Shell . - Hey , girl . - Y 'all ready , or need a minute ? - Oh , no , we 're ready right now . I 'm gonna see - Surf and turf or catfish ? Surf and turf or catfish ? I 'm gonna take a hamburger with an iced tea . Okay , then I 'll have the pasta special and a big chocolate milk . - Love you , Dolly . - All right . Let me tell you about the case . I think the jury 's heard the testimony and really understood it . They saw all the demonstrative evidence and evidence before them . We worked really hard . We had closing arguments last night . It lasted a long time , but I think the jury was really interested . We 're gonna make millions on this case . - Iced tea . - Thank you . And chocolate milk . - I 'll be right back . Hold that thought . - Okay . - He 's new . - They 're all new for just a minute . Listen , who 's that guy with Poelker , who was sitting with him at the bar ? That would be Brian Rueben . From some waste-disposal company from way out of town . Card member since 1987 . Nice . That 's weird . He doesn 't even work when he 's local . What 's he up to ? Bat attacks on humans are highly unusual and deadly attacks are absolutely unprecedented . - Until now . - Yeah , until now . I mean , something must have caused this . Something has changed them . We know that they have different bite marks but until we capture one , it 'll be hard to know any more . - Where do you usually find them ? - They 're nocturnal . So during the day they like dark places . Caves , typically . But we don 't even have any caves around here . Since they were kicked out of their natural habitat they adapted to a new one . Like that abandoned factory . Let 's go back to the abandoned factory . No . It 's been boarded up tight as a drum . They 're not there anymore . They 've gotta be around here somewhere . You take an animal out of his natural habitat , he 's gonna adapt to a new one , right ? That 's right , Eden . Okay , come on , guys . Let 's call it a day . Thank you for everything . - Let 's catch some . - Yeah , that 's my plan . And we 're gonna go with you . No , you 're not . Yes , we are , professor . How can we be expected to learn anything if we can 't get any practical experience ? Did you know that one of your fellow students contracted rabies from a bat bite ? You 're not coming . Wow , rabies ? I don 't know . Think I 'm gonna have to take off . Come on , babe . - Come on . - Bye , guys . Everybody out , please . Come on , guys . - No . - Guys , what do you think ? Yes ? - Yeah . - Yes . All right . A thousand times , no . Not only is there a university curfew in effect but I guarantee none of you have had your rabies shots . So forget about it . Not gonna happen . Lock the door when you leave . Okay , guys , I have an idea . Come on , Shanaynay . This is your big day . Come on . All right . Oh , no , no , no . What did I say ? Just turn around and go back to your dorms . Listen , professor , we 're adults . We 're capable of making our own decisions . It 's a bad decision . Come on . If people our age can go to war we can certainly help you capture some stupid vampire bats . Eden , soldiers have got rabies vaccinations . Yeah , well , so do we , okay ? Today after class we all went to the health centre . Give me that . Did I ever tell you how much I hate you kids ? All right , make yourselves useful . Aaron . Keith . In that bag , there 's a net . String it across those two trees over there . Make sure it 's not too taut . And Lizzie and Eden , I got a special job for you . Take Shanaynay over to the trees . Lizzie , give her a hand . - She 's a little unwilling . - Come on . Have fun . Oh , nice getup . Come on , Shanaynay . Come on . Professor Rierdon , just tell me that we 're not gonna hurt the goat . Miles , is there a sensitive New Age boy under that Izod veneer ? Don 't worry , we 're not gonna hurt the goat . She 's just a lure . - Fine . - Okay . - Is this even gonna work , guys ? - I don 't know . Then why are we here ? - Because we 're scientists . - Then why do I feel like a moron ? You don 't really want us to answer that , do you ? Look , we had a problem before us . Eden proposed a theory . We all said it sounded plausible . We 're conducting a field experiment . That 's science . Not that daunting . Did you hear that ? What is it , Lizzie ? I heard a swooshing sound . It 's probably just the wind blowing through your head . See ? Did you hear that ? There it is again . There . Okay , stay calm and let 's move towards the minivan . - What about the goat ? - Don 't worry about the goat . - Just save yourselves . - Come on , man ! Go , go , go . Oh , my God ! Close the window . Oh , my God ! Professor , why do you have a broom in your car ? A good scientist is always prepared for the worst . Oh , my ... That is one lucky goat . Would you hold that , Miles , please ? - Look at that . - What 's the matter ? These bats appear to have an extra set of fangs . So , what does that mean ? It means , fellow scientists , that we have made quite the discovery here . They 're not your everyday vampire bats , that 's for sure . You jeopardised the well-being of your students ? You had them break the curfew just to capture these bats ? Look , it was our decision to break the stupid curfew . Professor Rierdon didn 't want us to go . It 's all right , Eden . In hindsight , I couldn 't have done it without them . It was reckless . So where are the bats you captured with your good old-fashioned common sense ? Okay , this is what we know about the bats at this time . At first glimpse , they seem to be Desmodus rotundus : Vampire bats . But on closer inspection we noted that there are some significant differences . - What , you found a new species ? - No , I don 't think so . I think this is a mutation in an existing species . You see , typically , vampire bats have four fangs : Two on the top , two on the bottom . But these bats have eight fangs which apparently enables them to tear skin apart and suck significantly more blood . They also appear to need to feed more frequently . - Yeah , and they 're deadly . - Which is why they need to be stopped . We 're gonna try this poison . I strongly advise against the slash-and-burn approach . - Gotta be some other way . - We 're confiscating these bats , ma 'am . I need them for my research . They 're evidence . They were captured illegally . Sheriff , these bats are a menace to the general population . And I have some friends in Washington who would see great value in my keeping my bats for my research . If you have a problem with that ... Fine . We 'll only take half your bats , professor . We 're gonna put these on them . They 're tracking devices . - And we 'll track them back to their lair . - Precisely . That way , we can find and destroy them . That is , if they even have a single lair . - Well , typically they stick together . - Well , you 'd better hope so . Because these bats are anything but typical . Thanks for coming by so quickly . That 's okay . What 's going on ? My brother owns a farm outside of town . And he 's been finding deer like this all over his property . Obviously attacked by these vampire bats . I got to thinking what you said . So I ran these lab tests on the deer . They weren 't long for the world even if the bats hadn 't got to them . - What do you mean ? - Rabies . But there are some other irregularities that give me pause . First off , all of their internal organs were enlarged which in and of itself is unusual . But more significantly they each had large traces of hexachlorobenzene in their systems . Hexachlorobenzene ? Where does that come from ? Chemicals released during firefighting activities military exercises anything with a high-heat combustion . How 'd they come across that in wilderness ? Or anywhere ? Combustible by-products have strict EPA guidelines for how they 're disposed of . Combustion . What about waste incineration ? There 's that waste facility on the outskirts of town . Yeah . It 's not far from the river . This is it . Button up , guys . Nice . So we 're gonna break curfew and the law . It 's all in the name of science , Miles , my boy . Funny . Come on , guys . Let 's go . So can anybody tell me again why it is we 're out here ? Just look for anything out of the ordinary . Or maybe there 's nothing . We 're just trying to collect some data , guys . Did you hear that ? It was probably nothing . Could 've been just a deer . Deer ... Stop walking for a sec . - What the hell was that ? - What ? I don 't know , but it 's close . Spread out . Dan , there are deer tracks all over this place . They gotta be drinking the water . And the bats are feeding on the deer . So something 's in the water . That makes sense . Hey , guys , check this out . I think I found it . Maddy , over here . - Right ? - Yeah , good job . Gold star for you , Aaron . - Man , that smells absolutely putrid . - Oh , it 's burning my nose . - Keith , get me those vials . Quick . - Putrid . Just one . It 's disgusting . - Cease your activities . - Let 's get out of here . You 're trespassing on private property . Let 's go , guys . Go , go ! Stay down . Turn your flashlights off . All right . Oh , wait a minute . I forgot something . Yeah , your trusty broom . I trust the broom more than that thing . - I 'm not sharing with you . - Whatever you say . Yeah , definitely it . A little bit more . This looks like a perfect lair . Sure hope you 're right here , Schuster . Oh , I 'm right . You 'll see that I 'm right . Wow , it reeks in here . Well , right over there . Let that be a lesson to the non-believers . How do you know this is the only lair ? Technology doesn 't lie . Welcome back , Rebecca . All right , guys , let 's feed these bad boys . Careful . Could you imagine being excited by pig blood for dinner ? - They 're so gross . - I don 't think they 're that gross . I think they 're kind of cute , you know , like , in their , like , own bat way . Hold on . How much did you just feed them ? - Forty cc 's . - These bats are trippy , man . No , what 's trippy is that it 's 9 : 00 and we 're still here . What 's becoming of us , guys ? I 'll tell you what 's become of us , man . We 're workaholics , damn it . Tireless , dedicated overachievers with a commitment to a cause . - We 're unflappable . - He doesn 't know what that means . Before you even got on the table , you were like 12 feet tall so go ahead and hop down . I 'm not getting off the table . You know what ? I think we deserve a little break from all this vampire-bat drudgery and listen to some tunes . - Cool . - All right . I got some good stuff over here hidden away for you . Oh , I love this song . Are you kidding ? Okay , turn it off , man . This is brutal , man . Turn it off . Come on , guys . Okay , no , seriously , as cute as all of this is , turn it off , man . Oh , wow , talk about feedback . Oh , my God . Are you sure it 's okay that we 're here ? Totally , totally . This is my econ professor from last year 's house . - Okay . - He is on sabbatical which means we are all alone . Now , what could be better on a warm summer night ? - I 'm gonna get the lights . - Okay . Oh , my God . - You scared me . - Did I scare you ? You 're such a bad boy . You just take a seat and relax . Come and get me . Come on in . The water 's fine . - Did you hear that ? - Hear what ? - I think - Is someone here ? - No , no , no . It 's just a bird , okay ? Come on . Wait . Can you turn out the lights ? - What ? - You know I hate to have the lights on . Okay . All right , fine . Thank you . Donny , hurry up . Donny . Donny ? This is not funny . Oh , my God ! Get it off ! Get it off ! - Oh , my God . - Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! We got the analysis from the runoff water we collected at Carbide Waste Resources the other night . It 's full of hexachlorobenzene . My students and I ran tests on the bats that we still have in captivity . Their systems are loaded with this stuff . - Okay . - So our theory is that the deer drink the contaminated water , the bats feed off the deer causing a mutation in the bats . And it looks like now we 're dealing with the aftermath . And you think hexachlorobenzene could do this ? It 's highly toxic stuff . It builds up in the fatty body tissues of animals that are exposed to it . It 's just a hunch , but we think it makes sense . You know that local water is tested regularly under EPA guidelines . Unless somebody at Carbide is managing to cover this up . Excuse me , did you say something about Carbide Waste Resources ? Yeah , why ? Well , I was at lunch and I saw Poelker , Mayor Poelker having lunch with a Carbide guy . And if I may say , they were pretty cosy . - Excuse me . - Here , let me show you this . Hello . Yeah , this is she . Shelly , tell me again . What happened ? Hey , sheriff . Yeah . Okay . Thanks . Thanks for calling . That was Sheriff Herbst . He said that they found another one of my students dead . That wasn 't the only lair . What are you-all doing out in the hall ? - Check this out . - What ? - How 'd they get out ? - We let them out . - What ? - We made a discovery last night . - What kind of discovery ? - That the bats have no taste in music . - What are you talking about ? - Watch this . Hit sound on speaker one . And now speaker two . Bats guide themselves by sonar , right ? They 're attracted to the sound we created . By mistake . Most of science is , Lizzie . It 's convenient mistakes . This is brilliant . I don 't wanna be the enemy of fun or anything but how are we gonna get them back in the cage ? Watch this . Now adjust the speaker in the cage . Pretty cool , huh ? You did this ? On your own ? - Yeah , we 'd like to think so . - Yeah . This is it . - If the bats are attracted to music - - And we amplified the sound ... It goes to reason all the bats would be attracted to it as well . It 's genius . We 've gotta figure out how to get the bats into harm 's way before they kill anybody else . - Y 'all take care . - Okay . You got stuff all over you . Come here . Let me see . Ketchup off your ... That 's a big girl . Come on , darling . Come on . - Poelker . - Shelly . Taking time out of your busy schedule poisoning water to have a cocktail ? - What are you talking about ? - You know . You can take the boy out of juvenile hall but you can 't take the juvenile hall out of the boy . Shelly Dryer . - I been dealing with you my entire life - - It 's Beaudraux . - and I am really tired of you talking about things that you know nothing about . I know things . Get in my car . You don 't have kid seats . Then you drive . Come on . Come on . You drive . Come on . I 'll help you . I say we torch the place . - We can 't . - Why not ? That church is a designated landmark in a residential neighbourhood . Besides , it might not be their only lair . Even if we could torch the thing , some bats would get away . - What are we gonna do ? - Well , we ... Actually , my students discovered a signal that they 're attracted to . So if we could only use it to lure them into some kind of contained location ... What about the steam tunnels ? - They hot enough ? - It was pretty hot when I was there . You don 't look much worse for the wear of it . Besides the fact it 's illegal to be there , you could 've been killed . If university power had released pressure ... - ... you 'd have been stewed . - What do you mean ? All the university systems release pressure into those tunnels . So it might be possible to generate a significant amount of steam . In this heat , with the power plant operating at max capacity , if we released a huge amount of steam the temperature would rise enough to kill anything down there . You know , I think that that could work . Do it tonight . It 's a new moon . It 'll be dark . Bats love that . Yeah , it 's the weekend and people are gonna be out in droves curfew or no curfew . - Do it before somebody gets killed . - Right . Right . I 'll coordinate all that with you . Rami ? Violet ? Shell ? - Wonder where they are . - I 'm gonna give her a call . She left her phone . It 's not me . - Hello ? - Hey , kid . It 's Karl , Shelly . Karl , this is Shelly 's sister-in-law , Maddy . - Who 's Karl ? - I don 't know . He seems to know your sister intimately . You sound just like Shelly on the phone . Yeah , I get that a lot . Hey , we 're not sure where Shelly is . We 're looking for her ourselves . When did you last hear from her ? This morning . Told me she was taking the kids to lunch and then bringing them back to your place for naps before our date . They were supposed to have a date . She never showed up . Bring in one set at a time . Yeah , go for it . All right , you know what you gotta do ? What are you talking about ? Move the cables back up ? It 's gonna be sitting in that tunnel over there . It 's all the same system . Easier that way , you know ? She came here for lunch with the kids . They ate , made a big old mess and then they all got in the car and drove off with Mayor Poelker . Mayor Poelker ? - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . Thank you . That was very helpful . My sister stuck her nose where it doesn 't belong . This time she 's got our kids with her . Excuse me . - Maddy . - Daddy ! - What 's going on ? - Is this how you entertain our kids ? - Well , Poelker here - - Wait . Before you get into that I 'm gonna take the kids and we 're gonna meet you out in the car , okay ? Come on , sweetheart . Please , Professor Rierdon , have a seat right here . Okay , listen . Poelker here - I mean , Hank . - has just been giving me all the dish on Carbide . All right , let me fill you in . The gentleman Shelly saw me having lunch with is an executive at Carbide with a conscience . - He 's a whistle-blower . - I knew it . - Go on . - Now , he informed me that some of the higher-ups at Carbide aren 't necessarily well , aboveboard meeting the EPA guidelines . Now , all this is gonna stay in this room . So I started an investigation which I had to put on hold due to this bat problem . It appears as if Carbide is paying off some local officials just to keep the situation quiet till they rectify the problem . Which local officials ? - How long we got ? - Not long . We better hurry . Hey , guys . Thank you , Miles . - You and Herbst can handle things ? - We got it . - I 'm gonna head to the power plant . - Bye . Okay . Be safe , both of you . - You too . - Thanks . - Okay , what we got ? - Just about ready . - It 's gonna be loud . Got earplugs ? - Got them right here . All right . You two ? If this is gonna be loud enough , we gotta call the bats out of the lairs . - Where 's Schuster ? - Down in the tunnel . What ? Well , we gotta clear him out . Schuster , come in . You copy ? Schuster , come in . - I 'll pop down and get him , all right ? - Hurry it up . - We got a little bit before sunset . - Yeah . - Be safe , now . - You know me . Okay , Keith , the speakers are in place . You guys set ? I 'm all over it . Stand by . Get ready for the signal . You got it , Professor Rierdon . - Come on , Schuster , let 's go . - You spooked me . Yeah , well , I 'm a spooky kind of gal . It 's getting dark . We gotta get in the truck and go . Give me one second . I 'll just get these couple wires . Then we 'll go and annihilate these bastards . Amen to that . You know , it 's like you said , professor . Only a matter of time before global warming caught up to us . You know , each day , an area the size of a football field is disappearing out here . - I 'm just playing with you . - Right . Anyways , this is not about global warming . - Oh , is that so ? - Nope . This is the result of illegal dumping of poisonous chemicals into the water . - Is that what you think ? - I know it . - You make me laugh , professor . - What , you think this is funny ? No . It 's funny that you think a negligible amount of hexachlorobenzene could alter an entire species . I 'm gonna wait in the truck . - All right ? - Fire ! That 's enough . Everybody back in their vehicles . Let 's go , everybody . I mean it . Let 's go , girls . Come on , let 's go . Schuster , Maddy , do you copy ? Schuster , Maddy ? Maddy , you copy ? - Schuster here . We all set . - Good . Miles , Keith , turn on the church signal . What does a conscience cost , Schuster ? A conscience ? Rising waters and global warming is a little out of my jurisdiction . Authorities will think different when they hear the facts . What facts ? I didn 't hear any facts . Dan , it 's time . You guys ready ? Roger . Maddy , are you there ? Yeah , she 's with me . We 're heading on back up to the truck . Why don 't you just go ahead and kill the speakers in the cemetery ? How about the speakers in the steam tunnel ? I 'm all over it . Go ahead . Release the steam . Okay , let 's do it . It 's gonna be fun . Oh , Schuster . Schuster , don 't do this . Let it go . Schuster ! Schuster , don 't do it ! Let me go ! It 's working . It 's working , guys . Schuster , get up ! Get up ! There 's someone still down there ! Can you see ? Maddy . Maddy . Come on , help her out . Easy , easy . - Get some water . - I 'll get it . - You all right ? - Dan . Call Dan . - Get Dan on the phone . - Hurry ! Here , here , here . Drink . Hey , hey . Schuster . Schuster 's down there . Stop , wait ! Miles , no ! Maddy ! Maddy ! - You okay ? - Yeah . - You 're not hurt ? - No . - Hey . We did it . - Yeah . - Be good , now . - All right . It 's over , honey . It 's over . Good job , sweetheart . - Here you go , honey . - It 's Daddy ! - Yes , Daddy . - Thank you , Daddy . - Hey , you kids okay over there ? - Yup , yup . Head down . Don 't ! That tickles . The kids are over there . Quit it . There , I won . - You did it . - I won . I got ... Well ... Look , baby . Can I get you again ? Oh , Violet . Violet .

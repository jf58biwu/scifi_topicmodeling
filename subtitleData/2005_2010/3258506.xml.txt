That 's an engagement ring , that is . You 're getting married ? Yes , Rhys asked . And you said yes ? Well , no-one else will have me . I need stability , jack , someone I can rely on . Friday night 0h , it 's the service she 's meant to be late for , not her hen do . Where is she ? Here she is ! Here comes the bride Looking for a ride Here comes the bride And she 'll take it up the aisle ! Ey , thought you 'd bottled it . No , I had a lot on at work . 2 hours earlier Careful , Gwen ... this thing eats people . Oh , sorry , love , on your way . jack , It 's a shape-shifter ! He could look like anyone now , but he 's leaving a trail of black blood . He 's changed but it 's definitely him . He 's heading towards Trinity Street . So , is there anything to eat tonight , or is itjust booze all the way ? Booze , blokes , bopping and booze ! Gwen Cooper , you 're nicked . Oh , no . This is such a bad idea . I 'm getting married in ... like , what , what .. thirteen hours . Oh , look at me ! Ah , you 're gorgeous . Rhys is so lucky . I know . I 've heard about his cock ! What have you done to your arm ? - You all right ? - Yeah . Owen should take a look at that . Um , nothing , it 'sjust a scratch . Saturday morning Gwen . Torchwood Season02 Episode09 Something Borrowed Gwen , you 're pregnant . Almost full term . Pregnant ? That 's not possible . How are you doing , Gwen ? jack , tell me what 's going on ? - Owen says I 'm pregnant . - You think ? jesus Christ . What with ? It 's an exo-biological insemination . That alien last night . 0h , get off.It bit me , jack . That 's all . It passed the eggs on in the bite . Some species do that . A sneaky way of keeping the bloodline going . Boy , would Darwin have a field day , if he 'd made it to space . Mmm . Yeah . Great . Listen , Gwen , you are going to be fine , I promise , OK ? If there was any biological incompatibility you would be dead . Now , according to this scan you 're carrying a non-sentient blastopheric mass . A what ? It 's a kind of alien egg . But I 'm going to look after you , I promise . We 've got procedures for this situation . This has happened before ? You 've heard of immaculate conception , haven 't you ? Well ... Right , we take you back to the Hub . You lie back , I run a bio-xenic microtron , a couple of days , you 'll be right as rain . Whoa , a couple of days ? In five hours I 'm walking down the aisle , Owen ! No , you 're not . Gwen , I hate to say this , but you 're going to have to postpone the wedding . No ! No way . Have you any idea how much a wedding costs ? Listen , Gwen , you are not carrying the baby jesus . I don 't care ! I can 't put Rhys through this . He 's had to put up with enough , OK ? So I 'm not postponing the wedding . You are not thinking straight . Do not bring my bloody hormones into this , Mrjack Harkness ! OK , calm down . Owen has said if this wasn 't safe I would know about it by now . Right ? As far as I know yeah ... OK , so I am good until after the wedding . Then I 'll do whatever I have to do . Once I 'm Mrs Williams . Not before . Hello ? - Rhys ? - Gwen ! Morning , lovely . Don 't worry ... Banana Boat 's on the phone to the florist , checking the buttonholes . 0h , he showed up , then ? Yeah , Lanzarote cops let him go with a warning . Rhys , I need to see you . It 's bad luck before the wedding . What 's happened ? How is she ? She 's going ahead with the wedding . Which is fine , as long as she doesn 't go into labour at the altar . Rhys might forgive her being pregnant , but not giving birth to a razor-toothed monster that eats his family . Could that happen ? Well , look , the pregnancy 's advanced and we 're not familiar with the species . Which is why you , Owen , need to open up the guy with the teeth and make sure there 's no surprises . I 'm on it . Tosh , y0u 've got an early pass to the wedding . Keep an eye on Gwen . Ianto ... jack ? Gwen 's going to need a new wedding dress . Bigger . Gwen ? What is it ? You 've got me going out of my head . Don 't tell me you 're having second thoughts . No , I 'm not . Can I help you ? Yeah , I 'm looking for a wedding dress for a friend . 0f course you are , sir . You 'd be surprised , we 're quite used to men buying for their ' friends ' . - Bastard Torchwood ! - I know . - Bastard Torchwood ! - I know . Pregnant ! You 're pregnant ! Sorry , everything that could have screwed things up ... I don 't know what to say . Don 't say anything , all right ! Sorry . It 's not your fault . It 's them , it 's jack . .. It 's not like he didn 't know you were getting married today ! Why the hell did he have to send you out last night ? Because it 's my job ! Well , are you going to be all right ? I 'll be fine . They 'll take me to the Hub . - 0wen 's got this big machine thing . - Good . Yes . Right , erm , look , I 'll ... get Banana to start ringing people . We 'll tell everybody you 're ill.Appendicitis. .. We 're not postponing the wedding . No way . Forget the money , I want you where they can look after you , right ? Getting married today doesn 't matter . It matters to me ! It 's not about the money , Rhys . I want to marry you . Today . Whatever happens . If the skies are suddenly fill full of spaceships , or an army of weevils climb out ofthe drains on St Mary 's Street , you fool ! Do you not understand what I 'm saying , Rhys Williams ? All I want to do today is marry you , that 's all I want to do . Erm , Owen ? - Look at you . - Do you like it ? Drop-dead gorgeous , Tosh , and I think I speak with some authority . I don 't really get a chance to dress up much . What are you wearing ? The truth is , Tosh , weddings have never really been me , either . Love ' em and leave ' em . That was me . Owen , you should come , could be fun . Have you ever seen a dead man dance ? I 've seen Fred Astaire in Easter Parade . Twice . Late night TV . God , you need a date , don 't you ? Which this isn 't , is it ? No , Owen , it isn 't . I just want you to come to the wedding . Please . 0h , all right , I 'll dig out my dancing shoes . I know it 's been a while , duckling , but , er ... . We never dreamed this . Rhys and I wanted it to be a surprise for you . You 're always full of them , but , well , this beats them all . Is this why you haven 't come to see us ? All those cancelled visits ? No , no , Dad , don 't be silly . It 's my job . This mysterious job . All the same , Swansea isn 't on another planet . You could have phoned , duckling . I 'm sorry . Oh , don 't be sorry , Gwen . I can 't wait to see the look on Rhys 's mum 's face . It 's wonderful news , Gwen ! Your dad 's been holding his breath waiting for a little grandchild . I was with Rhys and his mates all night last night . No-one said anything about Gwen being pregnant . Well , Rhys was probably under orders . Gwen knows how to control her men . Studied under the Mistress . Oh , here 's Rhys 's mum and dad . - Brenda . - Geraint . - Barry . - Hello . Lovely to see you , Brenda . What a lovely outfit . Such a brave choice for you . And you were so made for green . - Big day at last . - How 's the bride ? Erm , maybe there 's something we should talk about ... - Gwen ! - This isn 't going to work , Rhys ! We haven 't thought it through . What about after the wedding ? I 've been thinking the same . My mum and dad think that they 're getting a grandchild . Your mum and dad are going to be excited , they 're going to be planning things . I can 't tell them I 've lost a baby . They 'll be devastated . We could tell them the truth . talk sense now , Rhys . Well , the lies don 't work , Gwen . Remember ? You tried it . What do you think the truth will do to them ? We 've seen what comes through the rift . I don 't want my mum and dad living in fear of what 's prowling around in the sewers ! I 'm sorry . Hey , jack . Hey . How are you doing ? Oh , you know , so far so good . Look , Tosh should be with you any time . Call it moral support . I don 't need a baby-sitter . Give it here . We don 't need you at all , jack ! You 've already done plenty to mess up today . Do us both a favour and keep well out of it , yeah ? Yeah , I hear you , Rhys . Look , still , congratulations ... It 's not his fault ... Aw , this is nice , in 't it , Trina ? Class on toast . Ey , you should get a brochure , Mervyn . If some poor girl ever gets drunk enough to marry you . Eh , yeah , that 's funny , I tell you what , it 's going to take more than a swanky hotel to get a catch like me down the aisle . And here 's mad Mervyn , the Minister of Sound ! Well , the Duke of Disco , the Regent of Rock and the Lord of Love . Whatever you say , mate . Listen , do you want a hand with the decks and the lights ? Aye , but ... I tell you what , reckon I 'm up for a bit of a Mervyn sandwich later . All right , love ? You 've got a big box . Do you want a hand with that ? No , thank you . I 'm fine . Are you going to the wedding ? I 'm a friend of Gwen 's . I 'm Banana.I suppose you can tell why . You come up in spots and go soft quickly ? I 'm playing the best man . Evolution is full of surprises . I get to check everything personally , right . - The disco , cake , flowers , seating . - Bridal suite ? Do you fancy a little drink later ? Sorry , I 'm intolerant to vaso-active amines . Bananas make me vomit . Now , a looker like you must be on the bride 's side . I don 't think they 've got your sort of style in Rhys 's family . I like to put on a show . jack sent me over with this . It 's beautiful . And , I don 't blame you for telling jack and Owen to stick a postponement . I think it 's wonderful you 're getting married , whatever . Tosh , thank you . You 're very lucky . You know , Tosh , it 'll happen for you , one day . There 's always Owen . .. I don 't think so . 'In sickness and in health , till death do us part ' ? That 's going to sound like a bad joke , isn 't it ? Erm , I 'll let you get on . If you need me , I 'll be downstairs . - Good luck . - Thank you . No , I like that one . Good choice . I estimated Gwen 's size from the Hub security laser scans . As you know , my dad was a master tailor . He could size a man 's inside leg measurement by his stride across the shop threshold . Ah , the family eye . Remind me to test it some time . - Well , if later on . .. - jack . - Yeah , brilliant , like that one . - We 've got a problem . Look what our friend was hiding . And that is ? A proteus gland . The shape-shifting organ of a Nostrovite . - And what is that , exactly ? - Trouble . Big trouble . No good-looking woman should be at a wedding without a flower . Ouch ! Bugger . Sorry . Can I get you another drink ? Actually , do you feel like getting a bite ? Another spritzer , please . My God ! It 's true ! But how ? Steady on , girl . I 'm on stage later . Hey , baby , if you 're looking for my room , youjust passed it , mind . I 'm not . And don 't call me ' baby ' . So what shall I call you , then ? Beautiful ? Don 't call me anything . Don 't say anything . Don 't move ! What have you done with him ? What the hell is going on ? You 're lucky , I 'm watching my figure . But maybe I 'll keep you for tea . A Nostrovite is a shape-shifting carnivore with a taste for human flesh . It 's intelligent and sneaky and , damn it , I should have seen this before . That 's it with shape-shifters - you never know what you 're looking at . What 's the big deal ? It 's dead . Yeah . This one is . Does there have to be more ? Nostrovites mate for life . You know , like swans and penguins . Yeah , except you don 't find Nostrovites on greetings cards . Right , and then the male Nostrovite carries the fertilized eggs in a sac in its mouth and passes it on to a host with a bite . Gwen . And where does the mother come in ? Well , she tracks down the host , and rips it open . That 's Nostrovite childbirth . And momma 's out there right now , looking for Gwen . Come on . Are you all right ? 0h , yeah , yeah , it wasjust a twinge . He 'll be flexing his muscles . Not long to go now . Tosh isn 't responding . Then let 's get going . Sure you 're ready for this , Owen ? You know Nostrovites . You think it 's 100 feet away , and it 's chewing on your liver . I don 't need my liver . You need me . The singularity scalpel ? Where are you going with that ? We need to get to Gwen before the Nostrovite , we might not get back to the Hub and the microtron weighs about two tonnes . That thing kills people . - I saved Martha with it . - Lucky shot . Listen you two , you 'd better start trusting me , OK ? I 've been working on it , and I 've got it sussed . With that Nostrovite , we don 't have too many options . He 's got a point . What is it with you ? Ever since Owen died , all you ever do is agree with him . I was brought up never to speak ill ofthe dead . Even if they 're still talking . OK , Owen . But you better be sure you know what you 're doing . Camouflage dressing ? I 'm having her dressmaker 's number . No way did Gwen look pregnant last night . 0h , we must have had way too much to drink . She was late , wasn 't she ? We must have been out of our heads by the time she showed up . 0h , must have been , not to notice she was pregnant . Great night , or what ? You look like an angel . Mum , I 'm so sorry about this . Gwen , it 's a baby . It 's G0d 's blessing . You will be a good wife , and a wonderful mother . And me and your dad , we 'll always be there for you , and for our grandchild . I 'll see you downstairs . I love you . Mom .. I love you too . Hurry up , Geraint . And make sure you don 't leave a wet patch ! Gwen ? What is it ? I can 't do this . I can 't lie to you and Mum , Dad . Dad , this baby isn 't Rhys 's . There 's still no sign of Banana Boat . He 'll be fine , Dad . Rhys , your mother says this wedding is becoming a nightmare . As if Gwen showing up pregnant wasn 't bad enough . Now you are sure it 's yours , aren 't you ? Dad ! I 'm marrying her ! I love Gwen , every atom of me loves Gwen , has done since the first time I laid eyes on her , OK ? You loved Cerys Morgan once . I was 12 years old ! Still no Banana Boat . Get away from me . Well , I wish I could , love . Don 't bother , I 've tried . We 're stuck fast . I can 't believe it . Can you at least move your hand ? Away ! If there 's another man , if you don 't want to go through with the wedding , it 's all right . We 'll sort things out . There isn 't another man . - But you said . - Please listen . Cardiff is in the middle of a space-time rift . A what ? I work for an organisation that controls what comes through it . Comes from where ? Other planets . Other dimensions . Aliens , Dad . I 'm talking about aliens . That 's what I do , Torchwood . We 're called Torchwood . We hunt down aliens that come through the rift . Oh , my God . Look , one bit me last night , don 't ask me to explain , I can 't . I 'm pregnant . Rhys isn 't the father . It 's an alien . It 's an alien . Poor girl , this wedding 's got her stressed to pieces . Thinks that baby of hers is an alien from outer space . - What ? - It 'll be all right . Once we get through today . Gwen seems to be taking her time . You remember how it is , Brenda . The bride likes to make an entrance . Maybe , but I wasn 't late for my wedding . No . Barry might have got away . If it comes back , it 's going to kill us , isn 't it ? Calm down . I 've got friends . They 'll find us . But what if they don 't ? What if it comes back ? I mean , we 're it 's bloody packed lunch , in 't we ? Help ! Help ! - Shut up ! - Help ! Someone help ! If it hears you screaming , it 'll come and shut you up ... permanently ! Help ! Someone ! Help . That 's enough , unless you want to start singing in falsetto . That really hurt . Friends and family of Rhys and Gwen , we 're here today to celebrate the marriage of two people , a ceremony binding in law ... - How much further ? - A few minutes . If people are going to make such a big deal about getting married , why come all the way out into the middle of nowhere , where no-one can find you , to do it ? That , to me , suggests inner conflict . It 's because the happy couple want everything to be perfect . An alien egg in your belly and its mother coming to rip you open . Yeah , perfect . .. Rhys and Gwen have chosen to solemnise their commitment before you ... But first the law requires me to ask of you all , if there is anyone here ... who knows of any reason why these two may not marry ? Stop ! Stop it ! Stop the wedding ! - Hold on ! - jack ? Gwen , believe me , I 'm sorry . But this has to stop now . Ijust knew that baby wasn 't Rhys 's . What the hell are you doing here ? jack , I am marrying Rhys ! Not now . You can 't . Butt out ! You 've screwed things up enough between me and Gwen . You 'll not mess up our wedding ! Listen , I am trying to save Gwen 's life . Yours , too . What 's going on , jack ? I 've got a fix on Tosh 's comms . Tosh . Are you OK ? just get me out of here ! All right , mate . I 'm Banana . - More like a gooseberry . - Owen . Oh , jesus , that 's disgusting . Let 's get you out of there . There were two of them ? Ma and Pa Nostrovite . They hunt in pairs . But childbirth is more of a ... three-way. He finds and impregnates a host . She then comes in like the midwife from hell , hanging around , watching , waiting , until the time is right . Then it gets messy . So you think it 's near ? She 's a shape-shifter , Rhys . She could be out there making small talk with your mom and dad . You reckon it 's all over , then ? Some good-looking guy sweeps up the aisle and tells you to hold off on the confetti . What are you going to do , marry Rhys ? So the baby 's his , is it ? Didn 't you see the look on her face when he showed up ? Anyway , I 'd better go and find Mervyn . Tell him not to bother getting George Michael out the back of the van . We 're not stopping the wedding . Gwen , there isn 't a choice . Ever since I 've met you , jack , all Rhys has had to put up with , with me , is crap . The lies . The danger . The complications . But he 's stood by me . Who else would do that ? Who else would marry me knowing that I am carrying some kind of monster inside me ? I love him , and I 'm going to marrying him , today . Thanks . But it is my wedding , too . Don 't I get a say ? That 's all we need . Ianto , after the girl , I need this contained . jack . 0h , God ! I want Gwen out of here now , jack . jack , I 've seen the shape-shifter . It 's a woman . She 's in black . Do you know what 's going on ? I 'm in the dark , too , Brenda . The problem seems to be an American with no sense of timing or fashion . And your daughter ! Call the police ! Mervyn 's been murdered ! jack , I 'm afraid the situation is uncontained . OK , Ianto , get to the SUV , jam the phone lines . The last thing we need is someone calling the police . Tosh , you 're with me , we 'll find that woman in black . Gwen , Owen needs to operate now . I want Gwen safe jack , now . I want her safe , too , Rhys . So we do what I say ! Rhys , jack knows what he 's doing darling , OK ? Look , if we run , the Nostrovite will be waiting for us . And we 're running out of time . What 's the plan , jack ? I 've got an idea . Then I 'm staying here OK ? Fine ! Tosh , with me . What the hell 's going on here ? I had a signal before . Move ! I need everyone to stay calm and do exactly as I tell you . - Who the hell are you ? - Torchwood . Gwen 's Torchwood ? You mean you 're real ? ! - jack ! There she is ! - Everybody down ! My God ... ! Damn , that thing 's fast ! But it won 't have gone far . Not without what it came for . Come on . That ? The singularity scalpel ? That is your ' idea ' ? Gwen , it 's cool , believe me . I 've done a lot of work on it since the whole Mayfly business . What is it ? Alien medical apparatus ... so Owen thinks . Thinks ? - Rhys ? Rhys , are you in there , Rhys ? - That 's his mother.That 's Rhys 's mother . Hiya . There 's ... There 's a monster , Rhys . That American and the japanese girl , they went after it . Stay here . jack , everything OK ? It got away Owen . How 's the patient ? Rhys and his mum are with her . jack ! That 's Rhys 's mum , there ! Come on . This isn 't Rhys 's baby , Brenda . It 's an alien . Get back , you ugly bitch ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? - That 's my mother ! - No . - It 's the alien . - I 'm not an alien ! You 're good , I 'll give you that . But I 'm not ! Yeah , and the Lone Ranger didn 't have a thing with Tonto . Does the shape-shifter copy smells too ? No . It 'sjust physical . Well , I 'd recognise that bloody awful perfume anywhere . It 's Brenda , jack.It 's Brenda That 's for calling my mother an ugly bitch ! If that 's Rhys 's mum , then who 's that outside ? Move ! There she is ! The bond between mother and child is a wonderful thing . Let her go . - Your mother for my child . - No deal . You don 't have a say Don 't listen to it , Gwen . It 's OK , Mum , I 'll make sure you 're safe . It won 't kill you , you 'll be OK . You can 't do this . It 's my Mum , Rhys. jack ... Rhys ! - OK , Mum ... - Gwen ... .. you 're going to be OK . It 's OK , Mum . Stay calm , still . Come to momma ! That 's the kind of daughter every mother must dream of . Cool as ice , packing an automatic . Gwen told me about you but I didn 't believe her . It 'll be back . Owen , get Gwen ready , I want that thing dealt with now . Gwen , I 'll be with you in a minute . I need to talk to Rhys . - What about ? - Something and nothing . Trust me . What , what ? Listen , Rhys , the singularity scalpel . The last time I used it I had two good mitts . So you can 't operate it ? I know you 'd be more happy that whoever had Gwen 's life in their hands could ... well , rely on both of them . Now I thought I could askjack . .. No , no , erm , show me what to do . Right , it kinda works itself . Hello , jack . Not quite the blushing bride , am I ? But I 'd given up on things going to plan a long time ago . If life always turned out the way we expected , what would be the point of living ? I didn 't expect to meet someone like you . Ifl hadn 't , I 'd be married by now . You 're not the only one who met somebody that knocked their world out of kilter . Rhys has always been there for me . Through all this madness , even when I haven 't even deserved it . He 's not afraid to tell me he loves me . Gwen Get her out of here ! Come on , then ! Do me a favour ! Hey , are you all right ? I 'm running around in a wedding dress with what feels like a keg of lager stuck up my skirt . What do YOU think , Rhys ? Come on . What happened ? Put it down , Owen . It thought that I 'd gone off . - Where 's Gwen and Rhys ? - They 've done a runner . I emptied a clip into that thing as did Gwen . But some mother-instinct or something is making that cow unstoppable . Our guns don 't work . Then I guess we 're gonna need a bigger gun . Rhys , I can 't go any further ! - It 's here ! - It 'll hear ! I don 't think there 's any point in keeping quiet , Gwen . What the hell are you doing with that ? Owen showed me how to use it . just do it ! Do it ! - Rhys ! - All right , all right . I 've got it now . I love you ... I really love you . Gwen ! Gwen ! Gwen ? ! Get away from her , Rhys ! Let me have my young and I won 't hurt you . You 're too late ! It 's gone ! And I 've had a gutful of you ! You get my girlfriend pregnant , you impersonate my mum and you ruin my wedding day ! Fuck ! Rhys , you 're a bad boy . And you know what bad boys get ? How 's that for a shape-shift ? Jack ; Hey , that whole Evil Dead thing looks pretty good on you , Rhys . - OK ? - Yeah . And ... the hero always gets the girl . I am sorry . I 've spoilt everything , haven 't I ? Do you still want to marry me ? .. I call upon these persons here present to witness that I , Gwen ... Elizabeth . .Cooper. . Do take thee , Rhys Alun Williams , to be my lawful wedded husband . .. Do take thee , Rhys Alun Williams , to be my lawful wedded husband . Come here . You ready to see that dead man dance , Tosh ? Come on . Mind ifl cut in ? Why not ? I 'm danced off my feet . I 'm gonna find a beer . Enjoy the honeymoon . I will . What will you do while I 'm gone ? Ooh , the usual . Pizza , Ianto . .. save the world a couple of times . Will you miss me ? Always . Rhys is a lucky man , a perfect husband . He 's loyal ... brave . .. .. he 's got a hell of a swing on him ! And best of all , he really loves you . I know . MayI ... erm ... ? Yes . There you go . Cheers , mate . You 'd never think a couple of hours ago they all nearly got torn apart by some alien psycho-bitch . It 's all been a bit too much for my mum and Brenda . I never thought I 'd see that . OK , jack , what 's going on ? Strange thing when you mix Level Six retcon with champagne . Really makes the party go with a swing . Then you fall asleep . You retconned our families ? It 's probably for the best . I don 't want my mum remembering what happened to her today . Maybe the happy couple shouldn 't either ? No , thank you . There 'll be no secrets in this marriage . Time for bed , I think . We 'll see you after the honeymoon . Stay out of trouble . Thank you for the dress . It was beautiful . Something tells me our bed time is a long way off . That 's right , guys , it 's been a busy day , but we are not finished yet . We 've got a lotto do . We 've got a major mop-up operation . And I want your best work . Remember , it 's Gwen 's wedding . That 's what I love about Torchwood . By day you 're chasing the scum ofthe universe . Come midnight , you 're the Wedding Fairy . It 's more than just a cinema . It 's the Electro . A once-in-a-lifetime show . Why not step inside ? I just saw jack . Part of this freak show ? The night travellers , they did exist . They only performed at the dead of night . So two people from a piece of film have decided to go AWOL ? - What 's wrong ? - Her mouth 's been drained of moisture . What the hell are they up to ? Time to bring the others . This way , please .

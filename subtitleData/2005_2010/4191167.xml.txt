 Our sun is dying . Mankind faces extinction . Seven years ago the Icarus Project sent a mission ... to restart the sun ... but that mission was lost before it reached the star . 16 months ago , I , Robert Capa , and a crew of seven ... left Earth frozen in a solar winter . Our payload ― a stellar bomb ... with a mass equivalent to Manhattan Island . Our purpose ― to create a star within a star . Eight astronauts strapped to the back of a bomb ― my bomb . Welcome to Icarus II . Icarus ? Yes , Dr. Searle ? Please re-filter the observation room portal . Filter up or down , Dr. Searle ? Down . Oh , my ... Icarus , how close is this to full brightness ? At this distance of 36 million miles ... you are observing the sun at 2 % of full brightness . Two percent ? Can you show me 4 % ? 4 % would result in irreversible damage ... to your retinas . However , you could observe 3.1 % for a period of not longer than 30 seconds . All right , Icarus ... I 'm going to reset the filter to 3.1 % . Well , it 's ... it 's invigorating . It 's like , um , taking a shower in light . You lose yourself a little . Like a floatation tank ? Actually , no . Uh ... it 's more like ― No , it 's not like a floatation tank at all . - It 's more like ... - What is it , beef ? It 's chicken . You don 't like it ? You take my shift next time . For psych tests on deep space ... I ran a number of sensory deprivation trials ... tested in total darkness on floatation tanks ... and the point about darkness is you float in it . - You and the darkness ... - Chili ! are distinct from each other ... because darkness is an absence of something . It 's a vacuum . But total light envelopes you . It becomes you . It 's very strange . I don 't , um ― I recommend it . What 's strange , Searle ... is that you 're the psych officer on this ship ... and I 'm clearly a lot saner than you are . Mmm , good . All right , if no one is going to say it , I 'm going to . The solar wind reading is much higher ... than we 'd anticipated at this distance . For the moment , we can still send package messages back . High-frequency verse will rise ... above the interference , and the moon stations ... will be able to pick them up . But it 's possible that within 24 hours ... we won 't be able to communicate at all . Possible ? Probable . We 'll finally be on our own . We 're 55 million miles from Earth . I 'd say we 're already on our own . Come on , guys . We were expecting this . No great drama . We are flying into the dead zone seven days sooner than we thought . But if any of you are planning on sending a final message home ... you should do it now . Uh , well , Mom and Dad ... uh ... uh , I hope you 're proud of your son ... saving mankind and so on . By the time you get this message , I 'll be in the dead zone . Uh , it came a little sooner than we thought ... but this means that you won 't be able to send a message back . So I just wanted to let you know that I don 't need the message ... because I know everything you want to say . Just remember ... it takes eight minutes for light to travel from sun to Earth ... which means you 'll know we 've succeeded ... about eight minutes after we deliver the payload . All you have to do is look out ... for a little extra brightness in the sky . So if you wake up one morning ... and it 's a particularly beautiful day ... you 'll know we made it . Okay . I 'm signing out . And I 'll see you in a couple of years . Ah ! Icarus , dial it down a little , will you ? Yes , Corazon . Captain ? I 'm guessing you 've been talking to Searle . So , do you have that report for me ? Yeah , right here . The 02 productivity is good . In fact , if anything , we 're overproducing . It will trail off dramatically when we get nearer . But in truth , we already have the oxygen reserves ... to make it there and a quarter way back . You 're thinking about Icarus I. Well , whatever it was that tripped them up ... I don 't think it was a lack of oxygen . Not on the outward journey at any rate . Fuck ! You fuckin ' ― You fuck ― - Mace ! Mace ! - Mace ! Mace ! - What the hell are you doing ? - Fuck ! - Relax . Put it down . - You son of a bitch ! I 'll fuckin ' ― Fucker took an hour in there ! I can 't send my package . The wind is too high ! - Mace ! Calm down . - I 'm sorry , all right ? Jesus . Kaneda , Searle , report to flight deck . - Fuck ! - What 's up ? I didn 't realize it was taking so long . We have an excess of manliness breaking out in the comm center . So how does this work ? Am I supposed to tell you about my childhood ? I probably know more about your childhood than you do . It 's the time . 16 months , you can get used to anything . You just ... lose track . I know I fucked up . From now on ... I 'm not going to lose track again . Prescription : Earth Room , two hours . And get a haircut , Mace . Yeah . Bring back the waves . Dr. Searle 's prescription specifies a peaceful module . The waves make me feel peaceful . Again . - Mace , I 'm sorry . - Listen , before you say anything ... I should have let you go first and ... - Capa ! Capa ! It 's me . I 'm the one apologizing , all right ? All right . - Was that the apology ? - Yeah . - Consider it accepted . - Okay . It was a sequence of contact reports on the top left shield quadrant ... which , by 1,700 , had turned into a minor asteroid storm ... none bigger than a raindrop . But we had 19 punctures ... and a secondary contact to the engine compartment . It took three alpha shifts to patch it up . Lost a little bite , but nothing serious . I watched them hit us from the observation room . Got to tell you , Moon Base , it was ― it was ... beautiful . Got to tell you , Moon Base , it was ― it was ... beautiful . - Mace . - Yeah ? Your maintenance program allows a further 14 minutes ... for the mainframe panel to remain out of coolant tank . Shit ! Ah ... Guys ... you want to see something ? I should have a few words to say ... but on reflection , what can one say ? Ladies and gentlemen ... Mercury . 23 hours ago , while making a routine check on the comm systems ― While listening to your space music ? While scanning the frequencies , I heard a transmission . It appeared as we flew into the dark side of Mercury . The iron content of the planet is acting as an antenna . There 's still high background interference ... but the signal is clear enough . Icarus , please play ... audio file 751B . Yes , Harvey . End file . What is it ? It 's the Icarus I. That signal is their distress beacon . Jesus . That 's impossible . It 's been seven years . Clearly it 's not impossible because you can hear it ... with your own ears . Are you saying they 're still alive ? - We don 't know . - But they could be . Their oxygen is self-replenishing , water is recycled ... and they have all the solar power that they need . What about food ? There 's no way their supplies could have lasted seven years . That depends . They had stock to cover eight people for three years . That 's a four-year shortfall ; that 's a hell of a diet . We don 't know what happened to Icarus I. There might have been an accident or something else . There might not have been eight people to feed . Captain , do we know where they are ? Well done , Capa ; that is the question . Icarus , please plot our trajectory ... following a slingshot around Mercury . Yes , Captain . Now plot the source of the Icarus I beacon . Jesus , they almost made it . That 's why no one picked up the signal until now . It was lost in the background light and noise . We 're gonna pass right by them . Within ten or 15,000 miles . Can anyone survive ? If the shield is intact . We 'll be able to see them . Yes . I need to look at all of this pretty carefully ― very carefully ― but if I had to make a guess right now ... I 'd say we could adjust our trajectory . We could fly straight to them . But we 're not gonna do that . Just to make it absolutely clear ... there 's no way we 're gonna do that . Do I have to spell it out for you ? We have a payload to deliver to the heart of our nearest star . We 're delivering that payload 'cause that star is dying ... and if it dies , we die . Everything dies . So that is our mission . There is nothing , literally ... nothing more important than completing our mission . End of story . - He 's right . - Of course I 'm right . Is anyone here seriously considering otherwise ? - May I put a counter-argument ? - No ! Captain ? Go ahead . It would , of course ... be absurd to alter our trajectory ... to assist the crew of the Icarus I. Even if we knew that some ... or even all of that crew are still alive ... their lives are entirely expendable when seen ... in the context of our mission . As are our own lives . - Exactly . - However ... there is something on board the Icarus I that may be worth the detour . As you pointed out , Mace , we have a payload to deliver . A payload , singular . Now , everything about the delivery and effectiveness of that payload ... is entirely theoretical . Simply put ... we don 't know if it 's gonna work . But what we do know is this : If we had two bombs , we 'd have two chances . - You 're assuming we 'd be able to pilot Icarus I. - Yes . Which is assuming that whatever stopped them completing the mission ... - wasn 't a fault or damage to the spacecraft . - Yes . - That 's a lot of assumptions . - It is . It 's a risk assessment . The question is : Does the risk of a detour ... outweigh the benefits of an extra payload ? We 'll have a vote . No , no . No , we won 't . We 're not a democracy . We 're a collection of astronauts and scientists . So we 're gonna make the most informed decision available to us . Made by you by any chance ? Made by the person best qualified ... to understand the complexities of the payload delivery : our physicist . Shit . Okay , Icarus , I want you to run the math ... on the successful delivery of the payload . Okay , payload delivery point reached . Detach the payload . Stellar bomb initiated and detached . Crew and living section have four minutes to clear and commence homeward journey . And four minutes after separation ... boosters automatically fire . Payload boosters will automatically fire ... after four-minute delay ... entering coronal hole in south polar cap . Magnetic field structure open . Temperature 37,000 de ... Reliability of projection has dropped below 45 % . Remaining projection is not open to useful speculation . Variables infinite ; accuracy unknown . That 's the problem right there . Between the boosters and the gravity of the sun ... the velocity of the payload will become so great ... space and time will become smeared together . Everything will distort . Everything will be unquantifiable . You have to come down on one side or the other . - I need a decision . - It 's not a decision . It 's a guess . It 's like flipping a coin and asking me to decide about whether it 'll be heads or tails . And ? Heads . We 've mined all Earth 's fissile materials for this bomb . There 's not gonna be another payload . The one we carry is our last chance ... our last best hope . Searle 's argument is sound . Two last hopes are better than one . That 's it . Slingshot complete . Icarus leaving Mercury orbit . Hey . Good dream ? Let me guess . The surface of the sun ? Only dream I ever have . Every time I shut my eyes , it 's always the same . Maybe you should talk to Dr. Searle about that . See if he can help you out . Maybe . I just wanted to let you know ... I think you made the right decision . Well ... Mace doesn 't . And I 'm guessing Harvey and Trey don 't either . Yeah , b ― but I do . Cory ! - Cassie , get the alarm . What 's going on ? - I screwed up . - It 's not you who screwed up . - It 's my responsibility . - We shouldn 't be straying from the mission . - Trey , cut to it . In order to change the route , I had to manually override Icarus . So I made all the calculations myself , and I double - and triple-checked them . They all worked out . So I set the new coordinates and put us on our way . So what 's the problem ? The trajectory is wrong ? The trajectory is good . But it changes our angle of approach to the sun by 1.1 degrees . You didn 't reset the shields to the new angle . Jesus Christ , Trey . I forgot . My head was full of velocities and fuel calculations and a million different ― I forgot ! All right ? ! People do shit . They get stressed and ― and fuck up . - I fucked up . - Trey . The fact is , we are still alive . A hole hasn 't burned in the side of the ship . We don 't have a 10,000-degree climate . So what 's the actual damage ? We don 't know . Icarus tried to reset the shields independently ... when the alarm triggered ... but all the sensors out there are burned out ... so we have no idea the state of the affected area . The only way we 're going to know is if we go out there . Okay . I 'll get suited up . It 's a two-man job . As second in command , you 're not going anywhere . - I volunteer . - No , I volunteer . Fine . I volunteer Capa . Sure . I 'll do it . Okay . Okay . You 've done this a thousand times in Earth orbit training . Yeah . You 're going to be fine . Okay ? Okay , Icarus ... I 'm going to be taking control here for a while . Okay , Cassie . I 'm going to be cutting speed , and I 'm going to be rotating us ... so the damage is facing away from the sun . - Do we understand each other ? - Yes , Cassie . If you rotate by that much , we 're going to lose Comm Towers 3 and 4 . Well , it 's a good thing we don 't need them then . We don 't need them now ; we 're going to need them to go home . We 'll cross that bridge when we come to it . In the meantime , I 'm going to try to give them as much shadow as I can . All right , guys , I 'm opening up . Okay . Kaneda , check . Helmet cam operational . Affirmative . Good image . - Capa , check . Helmet cam fully operational . - Affirmative . Exiting airlock with maintenance modules . Okay . Moving down to investigate damaged area . Okay , guys , nice and easy . Nice and easy . Copy . Icarus , please adjust shield to allow for rotation . Yes , Cassie . Establishing new alignment to Sun . Jesus . That 's the temperature change on the shields . The metal is just contracting and expanding . I know what it is , flyboy . It just sounds like she 's tearing apart . Fatal damage to Comms Towers 3 and 4 . Copy , Icarus : loss of Towers 3 and 4 . Cancel alarm . Shut down sensor to Comms Tower 3 and 4 . You should see it up here , guys . It 's pretty impressive . Okay , there are four damaged panels . They 're about 300 meters out . Capa , take it easy . You 're going through your 02 pretty fast . Oh . Copy that , Cory . That 's it . Slow down the breathing . Relaxed movement . Approaching the first panel . We were lucky . Can you guys see this ? We can see it . The hydraulics are burnt out . Let 's get this closed . Okay , Mace , test it . Good . That 's the first one closed . You can do it ? It will take a while ... but , yeah ... we can do it . - Lots of smiling faces . - Great job . I love you , Captain ! Moving to next panel . Three to go . Okay , well done . Well done , everybody . Hey . Don 't kill yourself , man . We got this , okay ? Whoa ! What 's going on , guys ? Cassie , the ship 's moving . We 're venting 02 . Shit . I think we 're venting 02 . Resuming computer control ... of Icarus II . Negative , Icarus . Manual control . Negative , Cassie . Computer control . Returning vessel to original rotation . - What ? - Icarus , override computer to manual control . Negative . Mission in jeopardy . Override command statement . Manual flight controls removed . - Why ? - Negative , Icarus . Negative . State reason immediately . Fire in oxygen garden . No ! Seal oxygen feed . Fire guard perimeter . Sealing sector , sealing feed . Seal sectors 5 through 9 . Copy . Sealing 5 through 9 . Kaneda , Capa , get back to the airlock now . Can 't . Can 't leave open panels . The ship will burn out if the solar shields are not repaired . They 're going to die . - Don 't . - They 're going to burn up . They are not . Override , Icarus . Cassie , pilot , emergency command 0-0-0 . Copy , command 0-0-0 . Second human confirmation required . Copy . Mace . Mace . Wait , Cassie . Jesus Christ . Harvey ! Harvey , Comms Officer , confirm backup 0-0-0 . Override command confirmed . Manual control returned . No . Icarus , continue procedure . What ? Captain ... back me up . Copy , Mace . Crew priority is to protect the payload . Get the fire out . Icarus , take control of the ship . Affirmative , Captain . Damn it ! Returning vessel to original rotation . - Let me in ! Please ! - Negative . Door is sealed by operating superior comms officer . Harvey ! You motherfucker ! Let me in ! Hazard diagnostic complete . Sprinkler system failing . Fire will burn for six hours . 60 % chance of containment failure . 75 % chance of collateral damage to life-support systems . What are we going to do ? - Flood it with 02 . - What ? It 'll cause a flashover , make it burn itself out . - We 'll lose the whole garden . - We already lost it . Jesus , Mace , I don 't know . Icarus , open the 02 tanks . Cory , get the hell out of there . Opening 02 tanks . No ! No ... 89 % of shield in full sunlight . Capa , go back . I 'll finish this . Please , I can do this . Go . Capa returning to airlock . Do you copy ? Copy , Capa . Hurry . 91 % of shield in full sunlight . 94 % of shield in full sunlight . Captain ? Captain . I 'm at the edge of the shield . Do you copy ? Captain , you must leave now . Captain ? 97 % of shield in full sunlight . Final panel closing . The shield is secure . You have to move now ! Captain , it 's right on ― Kaneda 's not gonna make it . You have to move ! You have to move now ! It 's too far . You have to move ! Why isn 't he moving ? Kaneda ... what do you see ? Searle , tell him to move . Kaneda ... what can you see ? Searle , copy ! - Kaneda ! - Searle ! Kaneda ! Kaneda ! Shield rotation complete . The breakdown is as follows : Trey is sedated in the med center . Dr. Searle has diagnosed him as a suicide risk . I don 't think any of us are about to question that diagnosis . As second in command , I am now the captain of 1carus II . Thanks both to Kaneda and Capa ... our shields are intact ... as is the payload . But the oxygen garden is totally destroyed . In addition , a large amount of 02 was burned in the fire . As it stands now ... we do not have enough oxygen reserves to get us to our payload delivery point ... let alone to survive the return journey . So cancel the ticker tape parade . We now have no choice but to rendezvous with Icarus I. If we 're going to complete the mission ... the Icarus I is our only hope . Technically , he made a mistake . What are you trying to say , Cory ? Harvey said there 's not enough oxygen to get us to the payload delivery point ... but there is . There just isn 't enough oxygen to get all of us there . Are you suggesting we let Trey kill himself ? No . And in any case , Trey wouldn 't be enough . We need to lose two more . Three out of seven ? That 's a lot of short straws . Capa , it 's me . It 's different being afraid ... that you won 't make it back home ... and then knowing that you won 't . Our survival depends on what we can salvage from Icarus I. No . We 're going to die out here , like the other crew . I know it . So do you . Are you scared ? When the stellar bomb is triggered ... very little will happen at first . And then a spark will pop into existence ... and it will hang for an instant , hovering in space ... and then it will split into two ... and those will split again ... and again and again . Detonation beyond all imagining . The big bang on a small scale . A new star born out of a dying one . I think it 'll be beautiful . No , I 'm not scared . I am . Searle , Capa , they 're waiting for you . Okay , let 's go . Be careful . Watch your step . Cassie , are you getting this on the feed ? Getting what ? The air ― it 's full of dust . Human skin . What ? 80 % of all dust is human skin . Sorry ! No lights ? - No . - No surprise . Anyone afraid of the dark ? We should split up . I 'm not sure that 's such a good idea . Yeah , you 're probably right . Might get picked off one at a time by aliens . Icarus I 's a big ship . We can 't search it effectively if we 're still in one group . Okay , you 're right . Mace , you head up for the flight deck , see if you can get her to fly . Searle , check the social area and the sleeping quarters . Capa , aim for the payload . I 'll check the garden . Let 's keep in contact , guys . Listen up , everybody . You got to see this . Seven years of unchecked growth . Can you see this ? It 's an ecosystem working beautifully . You see this ? We got 02 , everybody . That 's wonderful . Oh , my God , Cory , look at the ferns . That 's strange . Sub systems are fine . Solar harvest is fine . The ship should be up and running ... except I 'm not getting anything ... from the flight computer . Got water . Food . No crew . No bodies . Oh , my God . You can hardly walk it 's so thick . I am Pinbacker ... commander of the Icarus I. We have abandoned our mission . Our star is dying ! All our science ... all our hopes , our ― our dreams are foolish ... in the face of this ― We are ... dust . Nothing more . And to this dust we will return . When He chooses ... for us to die ... it is not our place to challenge God . Okay , that make sense to anyone ? Transmission code is six-and-a-half years ago . That would be after they entered the no-comm zone . In fact , that should be around the time they were supposed to deliver the payload . The payload is fully operational . Say again , Capa . The payload is fully operational . It 's A-okay . That 's great news . Looks like we got what we came for . No , we don 't . Go ahead , Mace . I know what caused the distress signal . There 's a coolant failure of some kind ... and the bottom line is ... it doesn 't matter that Capa has his payload . Without the mainframe , we can 't fly . It 's been sabotaged . We should never have gone off the mission . I got something to say . I found the crew . What happened ? They had an epiphany . They saw the light . They burned themselves ? No shit . I suspect the observation filter was fully opened . If we weren 't behind the screen of Icarus II , we 'd join them . Ashes to ashes ... stardust to stardust . - Icarus ! - Icarus ! Icarus , stabilize us ! - What the hell was that ? - Guys , get back to the airlock now . We have a major incident . We are floating free from you . Repeat : we are floating free . Go back to the airlock . Cassie ! The airlock has decoupled . We don 't know why . The locking system on Icarus I is totally ripped open . I can hold our current position , but we aren 't going to be able to dock again . There 's another thing , guys . You 've got a hull breach . I can see it . You 're losing atmosphere . We 're screwed . No , we 're not . One of us isn 't anyway . What happened ? The airlock 's destroyed . There 's only one suit . Capa 's taking it . - Why Capa ? - Because the rest of us are lower priority . I 'm not a low priority . You 're a comms officer on a ship that has no means of communication . I am the captain ! The mission needs a captain to hold it together . Harvey , Capa 's the only person outside of Icarus ... who can operate the payload . There is no choice . No , there 's no choice for you . Capa , I order you to remove that suit . Get out of the suit ! That is a direct order . I assure you ... when I 'm on board Icarus II that I will do everything within my power ― To what ? Shuttle back with more suits ? The airlock is ripped in half . Once we break that seal , how are we going to repressurize ? Shit . Cassie . Go . All right , listen . We can 't depressurize when we open the airlock for Capa . So the force of the expelled gas is going to fire him out , right ? Right . If you open your airlock and we line it up just right , he 'll fire inside . And so will we . Without suits ? - Get as close as you can . - You 'll have 20 meters to cover . At minus 273 degrees Celsius . It 's going to be cold , but we 'll make it . Anyone got any better ideas ? Copy that . Mace . One problem . The computer is down . One of us has to manually operate the seal . From inside . Shit . You 're right . So whatever happens , one of us is staying behind . I see . I get it . It 's me . That 's what you 're all thinking ? No , Harvey , it 's me . You okay ? Hey , Capa ... we 're only stardust . Mace , we 're lined up . Everything is set . Searle , you ready ? All right . We only got one shot at this . - Cassie , are you ready ? - Ready . Harvey , keep your eyes shut and exhale slowly . Copy . Let 's do it ! Yeah ! Crew detected in airlock . Recommend sealing outer airlock door . I lost Harvey . I lost Harvey . - Harvey 's gone . - Crew detected in airlock . Sealing outer airlock door . - Breathe , Mace , breathe ! - Cover my hand ! Cover my hand ! Capa ? You 're okay , Mace . You 're okay , Mace . It 's me . Breathe ! Capa , are you all right ? Yeah . Yeah . Let 's get you out of here . Yeah . Searle ? We 're leaving now . We 're going to complete the mission . We 're all thinking of you , Searle . Searle , we 're going to go now . We love you . So I 've been through Icarus' activity file ... and I checked it and double-checked it ... and Cory triple-checked it , and it 's the same results . So in other words , unless Icarus ... is deleting her own files , she didn 't do it . And there was no malfunction on the airlock hardware . Which means that the airlock was decoupled manually . Cassie and I were on the flight deck the whole time . And I was with Capa and Searle ... and I think we can all assume it wasn 't Harvey . Which leaves one possibility . Trey . Trey is so doped up he can hardly walk or feed himself . He sleeps for 23 hours a day , and he blames himself for everything that 's gone wrong . - Why would he do it ? - We don 't know . But the possibility remains that it was him , and we 've got to take that seriously . By doping him up more ? This isn 't just about the possibility ... whether he sabotaged the airlock hardware . There 's something else , too . When Searle and Harvey died , we lost two breathers . If Trey dies ... we 'll have the oxygen to make it to the delivery point . At least now we know what happened on Icarus I ― the same thing that 's happening here . Fuck you , Capa . What are you trying to remind us of ? Our lost humanity ? I 'll do it . I 'm not passing any bucks . Do it how ? That 's between me and Trey . We 'll have a vote this time . Unanimous decision required . So , you know where I stand . And me . What are you asking ? That we weigh the life of one against the future of mankind ? Kill him . Cassie . No . Cassie ― I know the argument . I know the logic . You 're saying you need my vote . I 'm saying you can 't have it . So what do we do ? Oh , God . I 'm sorry , Cassie . Make it easy for him ... somehow . Find a kindness . Trey . Everybody get here now ! He cut his wrists . He took responsibility . All these deaths : Kaneda ... Searle , Harvey ... Trey ― none of them would have happened if you hadn 't diverted the mission . What do you want me to say ? I don 't want you to say shit . I just want you to know that this ... belongs here . Fuck you ! Fuck ! Fuck . Air 's low . We need to limit our exertions . Icarus ? Yes , Capa ? Run an update on biometric signs for all crew . Check oxygen consumption . Checking . Thank you . Capa . Yes ? You are dying . All crew are dying . We know we 're dying . As long as we can live long enough ... to deliver the payload , we 're okay with it . Capa , warning : You will not live long enough to deliver the payload . Please clarify . 12 hours before crew will be unable to perform complex tasks . 14 hours before crew will be unable to perform basic tasks . 16 hours until death . Journey time to delivery point : 19 hours . No , that 's impossible . Corazon was certain we 'd have remaining oxygen to keep four crew alive . Affirmative . Four crew could potentially survive on current reserves . Trey is dead . There are only four crew members . Negative . Affirmative , Icarus , four crew ― Mace , Cassie , Corazon and me . Five crew members . Icarus . Yes ? Who 's the fifth crew member ? Unknown . Where is the fifth crew member ? In the observation room . Are you an angel ? Has the time come ? Huh ? I 've been waiting so long . Who are you ? Who am I ? At the end of time ... a moment will come when just one man remains . And the moment will pass . The man will be gone . There will be nothing to show that we were ever here ... but stardust . The last man , alone with God . Am I that man ? My God . My God . Pinbacker . Not your God . Mine . Icarus ! Close down . Everyone ! Oh , God . Icarus . Warning : You do not have authority ... to remove the mainframe panels from the coolant . Please return the panels to the coolant . I cannot locate your biometric signs . Please identify yourself . You gotta be kidding . Oh . My God . Baby . Beautiful baby . Icarus , patch me through to Mace . I have something wonderful to show him . Or Cassie or Capa . Icarus . Don 't fight . Mace ! Capa ? Is anyone else getting silence from Icarus ? Anybody ? Capa ? ! Icarus , why are we in orbit ? Respond ! What ? Jesus Christ . Capa ! Capa ! In the suit . Use the hard link . In the helmet . Mace ! - What the hell is going on ? - Mace ! Why are we locked in orbit ? I can 't talk to Icarus . Pinbacker is on board ! He 's trying to stop the mission . He 's trying to destroy the mission ! - He 's insane ! - Shit ! Mace , listen to me . I 'm locked in the airlock ! Jesus Christ . The mainframe is out of the coolant ! The mechanism is disabled ! I can 't lower the mainframe panels ! Mace , repeat , please . Repeat ! Shit . Icarus is going to burn out . Mace ! Mace , come in ! Come on , you fucker . Come on ! Capa . Capa . - Mace ? - We 're clearing orbit . The computer is down . I don 't know if I can get her back online . You 'll have to break us out of orbit manually . The only way to do that ... is to separate the payload . You get it , Capa ? Force the bomb into the sun . Separate the payload . You 'll have to get to the bomb and ... and detonate it manually from the console . I 'm locked in the airlock . Do you copy ? I 'm locked in the airlock ! I don 't know how . Just do it . Just do it . Okay , I 'm going to do this . Copy , Mace . Copy . Just ― Capa ! My leg ! Oh , God ! Do it , Capa ! Do it . Mace . Come on . Come on . Come on . The only dream I ever have . Is it the surface of the sun ? Every time I shut my eyes , it 's always the same . Cassie ? Cassie . We 're flying into the sun . Cassie , there 's not much time . I need to know . Where is he ? Is he here ? For seven years , I spoke with God . He told me to take us all to Heaven . No ! Finish it . Six . Seven . Please . Hi , sis . Um ... kiss the kids . You guys , come on . It 's time . So if you wake up one morning ... and it 's a particularly beautiful day ... you 'll know we made it . Okay . I 'm signing out .

 Previously on heroes ... I think I found someone to fill joseph 's shoes . How do I look ? Like everybody else . I 've never met you before . You pulled me from the 424 bus After it crashed at lexington and 53rd . What made you become a paramedic ? I wanted to save lives instead of watching them pass . You 're exactly who I 'd hoped you 'd be . Hi , I need a file . Who are you listening to ? I 'm talking to myself . Seriously , what are you ? A vampire ? An alien ? Some kind of freakish government experiment ? I saw this girl on youtube . She was born with this gene that doesn 't let her feel any pain . I didn 't tell her , she just found out . Gretchen is not the enemy . She 's just a girl . And she 's the only friend that I 've made . This is my mess , and I 'm gonna clean it up . I 'm tired of keeping this secret to myself . Do you wanna be my roommate ? To closure . To closure . - Have a little too much to drink ? - On the ground ! Hands behind your head . Down ! Now ! Mind your backs . Watch your back , lydia . - Mrs. Comey 's unparalleled blueberry waffles . This is my favorite part of the day . It 's full of possibility . Before the inevitable monkey wrenches Come looking for us . But more than anything ... It 's about being with all of you . I know grace is a supper thing , But every morning I thank heaven and earth For our family . Sadly , joseph 's death has left us an empty seat , A broken circle , But I feel like we 're on the way to mend it . There are lost lambs out there . They 're like us , but they 're hiding . Alone . Pretending to be that which they are not . It 's sad , pathetic . These people , they desperately need what we have . Understanding , unconditional love , family , trust - Who are we to deny anyone that ? Today 's an important day for us-our family . And for one of them too . Because by day 's end , We will have a full table again . Eat . Okay , I gotta ask , what 's with the ear-to-ear , smiley ? This ... This is cool . Drinking chocolate milk ? No . Me . In college . In a dining hall with my new college roommate . No snipers shooting at me , no serial killers hunting me - It 's a refreshing change of pace . Yeah , tedium can be such a thrill . I have been chasing normal life forever , And I 've finally caught it . I mean , don 't get me wrong , the chocolate milk is awesome . But right here , right now ... Is full of possibilities . I can be anyone . Claire bennet . You can 't escape your destiny . I am becky taylor . Psi alpha rush chair . Your mom , sandra 's sorority . Your mom was in a sorority ? She totally was . Hi , becky . - Hi . So national has you on a list of legacies . But we haven 't heard from you about rush . Oh , I 'm not really sure I 'm a sorority girl . Neither was I at first . So listen , open rush starts today at the house . Why don 't you come by and meet the girls . No strings . - Yeah . Why not ? - She 's gonna have to pass . Well , great . I 'll see you there . Thanks . Isn 't this what we 've been talking about ? Possibilities ? I mean , I think my mom is still friends With her sorority sisters . Sororities are just a social crutch For people who can 't make their own friends . She said " no strings attached . " What 's the harm ? the harm is they get you alone And replace you with stepford-claire . Well , okay , how about I don 't go alone ? Yeah ! No . No , no way . Please ? Pretty please ? I 'll be your best friend . - I 'll throw in a chocolate milk . Ah ... What would stepford-gretchen wear to one of these things ? Captain lubbock ? I 'm dr . Gibson . Madeline . Where 's doctor verheiden ? Retired . You 're new ? I 've been interning with dr . Verheiden At a . U. For three years . Specializing in psychopathy , malignant narcissism disorder - And how many actual real-life criminal Psych consults have you done ? Including this one ? So , who is he ? We have no idea . And neither does he . Found him last night covered in dirt , blood . Bullet holes in his jacket . The guy doesn 't know his name , what day it is , nothing . Amnesia can be very complicated . Let me simplify it for you , madeline . Take out your rubber stamp and mark this guy " insane . " They don 't give us stamps . I 'm gonna need to talk to him . Hi . My name 's dr . Gibson . I 'm here to help you . Can you tell me your name ? I ... There 's been a lot of that . Starts and stops . Mostly stops . What are you thinking ? Could be an aphasia . Could be a what ? Any trauma to the head could result in brain damage . He was like this when we found him . Can you tell me what happened to you ? It was ... I was ... In ... The forest . lost . And then I was - Take your time . Walking ... And now I 'm here ... In this room . In this tiny room , and I - I ... Captain , can you do me a favor and unlock these cuffs ? No . I don 't make a habit of locking myself in With unrestrained lunatics . Then can you leave me your keys on the way out ? Let 's clean you up . Get you some clothes . Maybe something to drink . I 'm gonna help you as best I can . Help you figure out who you are . Put the pieces together . Promise . Emma . I wanted to talk to you about yesterday . Are you still seeing things - the colors ? I was thinking more about it . I have another theory - conversion disorder . They used to call it - I think this whole filing girl act is finally getting to you . Only the ones who happen to be my daughter . I think this whole focusing on work thing is getting to me . I 've been told by more than one person That I 've closed myself off from human connection . Here , mom . Mom . Careful , it 's hot . So this is me trying to connect again . Starting with you , my family . I have to bother to show up at least . You did call nathan , right ? Yeah , a couple times , mom . So I 'm thinking if - You didn 't just talk to the aide ? That elizabeth woman is a phone message black hole . Can we just focus on me for a second , mom ? Yes , you hide in here . You 're filing things , It 's the waste of a brilliant mind . Be serious . So I thought being a paramedic , Saving the most people possible - That would fill that hole , but I ... Mom ? Yes . Yes , you 're right . Nathan will be fine . Let 's just , um ... Go on with what you were saying . Start over . I 'm not starting over . I thought you said it was important . I ran into chief kaufman . And he said that you could Restart your residency if you want . He always thought you 'd make a wonderful doctor . It 's been six years . It 's time to stop blaming yourself For christopher 's death . You have to stop grieving and take your life back , emma . I 'm not grieving , I 'm ... Emma . I 've got to go . Got to get to work . I think I 'll stay for a while . Okay . - Maybe nathan 's just running late . It 's good seeing you . Hey ! Hey . Yes ? You work too much . You know that . - I do . Bye . And since 1924 it has been our charge to populate this house - We 're late . With girls of the utmost quality and integrity . This is of course where you all come in . We can 't wait to get to know each and every one of you . Which brings us to my absolute favorite part of rush ... G-t-k-p-p-s-d . Get-to-know-perspective-pledges speed dating . Yay ! Okay . So all the girls on my right to the chairs on the right . And all the girls on my left to the left . Should we make a break for it ? No , this is what normal girls do , right ? Really ? - Scariest thing that ever happened to me ? Does this count ? My mom raises professional show dogs . Show dog . No boyfriend to speak of . My dad works in paper . Government paper . I mean , it 's more like a series of ... No boyfriends . Uh ... Hobbies ? Um ... You used to be a cheerleader , right ? How 'd you know ? Gretchen told me . Really ? Did she now ? So you and gretchen both lived in texas ? Last round , ladies ! Make it count ! So claire , I feel like I know you already . Let me guess , gretchen ? She 's really cool . She 's very ... Edgy . Yeah . Ah ! I mean , you almost ... Are you all right ? Hey , wait up a second . Hey , wait . Wait , wait . Are you okay ? You almost got hit by a - I mean that was - you almost got hit . You 're welcome . Oh , come on ! Hand me that , will you ? Who is it ? The new family member ? Why are you so interested ? You used my body to find them . I am understandably vested . Is it petrelli ? Nakamura ? The strauss woman ? The college co-ed ? Claire bennet . Is it her ? You don 't know , do you ? I do not . But I felt something . In my bones , in the earth . But the dust hasn 't settled yet . It 's a gamble . Making promises and proclamations to all of us Based on a feeling . I understand the risks . But the rewards of growing our family are worth it . We 've got lots of cousins out there . Plenty of candidates . Many seeds planted . But who will break ground first ? I guess we 'll just have to wait and see . Hey , have you seen my white sweater , it 's frilly and - Looks kind of exactly like that . yeah , um ... Can I borrow this ? Uh ... No-yeah . Go ahead . - Are you sure , 'cause that " go ahead " Sounded a little bit annoyed , and I can just take it off . No , don 't be silly . It looks good on you . Cool . Thanks . Um , so I 'm just gonna use the restroom and then we gotta go . Yeah , we 're heading back that way now . Ready ? Um ... Is everything okay ? Yeah . Why don 't you go on without me and I 'll catch up ? No , I can just wait . - No , don 't worry about it . I mean , it 's a mixer , right ? Feel like we should be mixing with people we don 't know . I know you already . You know ? Right . Oh . Mix master me . Okay . I 'll see you . It 's amazing . What is this ? Tea . You never had tea before ? I 've never had anything . It all feels ... It feels so new . Like I 'm feeling everything for the first time . Hot . And this ... Is cold . It 's like I know these things , These words , these feelings . But they 're - I can 't put them together . They 're not - in my head they 're there . And then they 're not . They 're gone . And it 's ... Scary ? It 's very scary . But also ... Somehow beautiful . All of it is overwhelmingly beautiful . " jamais vu . " It 's the opposite of deja vu , It 's quite common in cases Of seizures and disassociate amnesia . That 's good news . How is that good news ? I think something traumatic happened to you And you 've blocked it out . It means that the " you " in you is still in there . Somewhere . I 'd like to try a memory exercise . I want you to close your eyes and tell me The first thing that you see . Um ... Nothing , it 's just black . Just relax and be yourself . Um ... The ticking is distracting . What do you mean ? That clock and your watch are - They 're off . Somehow the different ticks , different timing . One is faster , much faster . This watch has been running fast for years . I keep meaning to fix it . But wha - You heard that ? Um ... Uh ... So , this ticking thing ... It 's good . It 's your subconscious . It 's probably a clue to your past . let 's-let 's try again . Can I see you in the hall , doc ? I 'll just be a sec . Okay ? Afis just kicked back a fingerprint match . We got an I.D. ¶ I can believe in myself ¶ ¶ suddenly I 'm up on top of the world ¶ ¶ it should 've been somebody else ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ believe it or not I 'm walking on air ¶ ¶ I never thought I could feel so free ¶ ¶ flying away on a wing and a prayer ¶ ¶ who could it be ? ¶ ¶ believe it or not , it 's just me ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ just like the light of a new day ¶ ¶ it hit me from out of the blue ¶ ¶ breaking me out of the spell I was in ¶ ¶ making all of my wishes come true ¶ Colors .

There are people like us who have abilities . They can fly , and teleport , and read minds . Sometimes I misunderstand . So can you ... ? That 's crazy . Is it ? ¶ ¶ Wow . Pretty amazing , huh ? Why me ? Why now ? That I don 't know . Maybe we could get lunch tomorrow . Figure it out . Get you out of the file room . I 'm fine with the file room . No , I didn 't mean - - it 's fine . ¶ ¶ Claire ! Hey ! - Hey ! I 'm so glad you came back . I was worried you 'd get cold feet . - No , my feet are actually very toasty in here . it was nice to meet the girls . It 's good to expand my social venn diagram ... Into more circles . Then why stop now , right ? Kara ! Claire bennet , kara hayback . Yeah , I think we met at the g-p-p - oh , yeah . - Did you know that you 're both ex-cheerleaders ? You too ? I had spirit , yes I did . what made you quit ? It sounds stupid , but I kind of hated The cheerleading part of cheerleading . That does not sound stupid at all . I liked the bus rides and the bake sales , And I rocked a mean poster , but football 's kind of ... Pointless and boring . Exactly . Is that why you got out of the business ? No , I just - Watch out ! Hands on the table , palms down . Where 's dr . Gibson ? I sent her home . What , no . She ... She was here-she said that she 'd came in here to - She was here to tell us who you are . But now we know that , gabriel . You 're a watchmaker from queens who murdered your own mother .

I didn 't say you did . But you 're thinking it , weren 't you ? Gretchen , you were the only one there . Why would I do something like that ? Maybe because I was making new friends , Maybe because you wanted to expose My freakiness to everyone . do you actually realize How ridiculous that sounds ? - I saw what you 've been looking at on your computer , The stuff about me . What were you doing snooping on my computer ? I wasn 't snooping . A book fell , the computer turned on , and I saw it . A book jumped off my shelf and begged you to invade my privacy ? Yes , it did ! So I googled you . So what 's the big deal ? I saw the stuff about annie too . Can you honestly tell me you had nothing to do with it ? Wow .

I wanted to check on your work with claire bennet . Well , we 're sisters now . So there 's that . You 're doing everything you can to isolate her ? Push other people away , push her in our direction ? Honestly ? I feel like all I do is push . What made you quit ? - Sounds stupid , but I kind of Hated the cheerleading part of cheerleading . That does not sound stupid at all . I like the bus rides and the bake sales , And I rocked a mean poster , but football 's kind of ... Pointless and boring . Exactly . Is that why you got out of the business ? No , I just ... Watch out ! Hey , I didn 't see you leave the party . I guess you 're still there . And you left the windows open .

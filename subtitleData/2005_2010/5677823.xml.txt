 Previously on Heroes . I think our only real option at this point is to get the Unites States Government involved . I want to round them up and put them in a facility where they won 't be a danger to anyone . What would your hunter do if he knew you were one of them , too ? Who are you ? And what do you want ? I want you to get in the van . Mayday , mayday , mayday ! Den Mother 3-1 going down . Daphne ! - Daphne ! - Matt ! If you don 't want to see them punished , what do you want ? I want them to pay . What are you saying to her , Nathan ? You 're telling her that I 'm unstable ? Crazed ? You lock me up . It 's over , Pete . Give up . No , this is the beginning . He 's working for a secret program , imprisoning people with powers . Has it ever occurred to you that I don 't have a choice ? There is always a choice ! ... and they have made it very clear to me that if I am not on board , that Claire will be on that list ! Your mother wants me to move out of the house for a while . She 's right . I don 't like this , Matt . Well , you got any better ideas ? It 's a huge risk , being out in the open . We should be laying low . And what ? What ? Run forever ? I don 't know . Yeah . That 's my point . We 're being hunted , and we have no idea by who , how , why . Noah Bennet has all the answers that we 're looking for . Hey , did you get it ? Yeah . Amobarbital . One dose of this , he 's knocked out cold . What ? What 's wrong ? Can 't you just read his mind ? Get what we need that way ? No . We 've been over this . Noah is too well-trained , and he 's never off his guard . Guys , look , I was a cop . You 're a scientist . A nurse . We did nothing wrong , and they turned us into fugitives . But drugging and kidnapping people ? Look , I don 't like it , either , but this way , it gives us answers . Yeah , straight up interrogation isn 't going to work , not with Bennet . We need to get creative . Staying at the hotel ? Yeah . Just for a little while . I 'm actually looking for an apartment in town , if you know of anything . No . Welcome to Costa Verde . Well , it looks like our friend here had about three too many . Don 't worry . We 'll get him home safe . Well ? It 's working . It 's working . Ten people died last night in Ohio when a house spontaneously caught on fire . I 'm thinking we should investigate sooner rather than later . It 's over , Noah . It 's all over . Primatech may have burned to the ground , but that doesn 't change anything . We have a lot of work to do . Primatech should have been shut down a long time ago . The Company had a good run , but its time has passed . No . We got the job done . Yes , you certainly did , and I appreciate it . What is this ? For your years of service . Pension . Severance . And this is from me . Why are you doing this ? Bag and tag . One of us , one of them . It 's an antiquated system desperately trying to remain relevant . So , we adapt and we get it right . I don 't think we can , I don 't think we should . I am tired , Noah . I have told so many lies . Maybe it 's not too late to cobble my family back together . But it 's a good thing . You get to go home , to Claire . This is everything you 've ever fought for , and you won . This is all I 've ever known . What am I supposed to do now ? Take care of Claire . Take care of yourself . All right . So , I 'm gonna be able to get to these memories that we 're looking for . I 'm going to find out exactly how this whole thing happened , who 's behind it and how they work . We 're gonna find out how to stop hiding and start fighting back . And how far are you willing to push ? As far as I need to . This better be good . Face time at state dinners is hard to come by . You heard from Bennet ? No . Why ? He 's off the grid , going on three hours . Standing orders are to check in after duty . He didn 't . What about Claire ? Is she okay ? Yes . Your daughter 's fine . I want every inch of surveillance on Noah Bennet . Everywhere he 's been , everywhere he might go . You spying on your own men ? Nobody is above scrutiny , myself included . You and Bennet , you 're both compromised . What 's that supposed to mean ? Your brother , Peter , your daughter , Claire ... Peter gets treated like everyone else . Yeah , and Claire gets a free pass . That makes both yours and Bennet 's choices tarnished . Are you spying on me ? You barely touched your prime rib . Everything okay out there ? Yeah , it still feels like we 're sitting ducks in here , come on . We can 't rush an interrogation . This isn 't an interrogation . It 's torture . You 're straining his entire system . What , do you think I 'm hurting him on purpose ? I think you have a personal vendetta , yeah . I don 't think you know what the hell you 're talking about . - They killed Daphne , Matt . - Daphne . This isn 't about Daphne . This is about me helping everybody . Well , you 're not helping him . He has done much worse to me . You 're better than him , Matt . That 's my point . No , the point is he 's in pain . Does he have to be ? Look , the drugs are ... It 's not gonna be comfortable . I 'm digging through his brain ... To find a memory . Can we really trust this ? I mean , who knows what information 's been tainted by time and perception ? We know nothing . He knows everything that we need to know . He 's right . Do I have your permission to go back in now ? Let 's find out how this whole thing began . Need any help ? Four letter word , " Thin Man dog . " Asta . Asta . I 'm gonna go get changed . If you 're gonna shower , you should go . We have dinner in an hour with the Bulows . Who ? Jenny and Ken . We 're on the PTA with them at Lyle 's school . They 're nice . Oh , right . You didn 't make any other plans , did you ? No , no . It sounds great . It 's nice to have you around . Noah . Nathan . Claire 's ... I have no idea . Actually , at the mall , maybe . She 's at the library . Secret Service thing . Of course . I didn 't want her to see me here . I wanted to talk to you alone . Do you have a minute ? Yeah . Yeah , sure . Come on in . What 's going on ? I 've set some things in motion . Things ? Everything 's gonna change , and I just want you to know Claire 's going to be safe . What do you mean " safe " ? What have you done ? Noah , I got into politics so I could help people , make the big impact . What have you done ? I 'm certain that you involved yourself with the Company for the same reason . You sensed there was a need . Well , that need still exists . People with abilities are a threat . Primatech is closed . Primatech ? With all due respect , Primatech never did the job that was required of them . Then you have the solution . The United States government has the resources and the authority to contain this problem . Wait a minute . What are you talking about here ? Rounding people up ? For starters , yeah . Incarceration is the only way to make sure everybody is safe . Everybody . Yourself included . Certain exceptions are going to be made . Is Claire an exception ? She could be , but I need your help . What do you plan to do once you have everybody ? We find an answer . We get the best team of scientists and we find a way to eliminate these abilities forever . And if that 's not possible ? I refuse to accept that . My abilities were given to me . They can be taken away . You know you 're going to be seen as a villain , locking people away . I 'll play whatever role I need to . Claire will never look at you the same way again . Claire never needs to know this . But she will . They all will , and they will blame you . They won 't understand . I have gone so far off the rails with this , so far around the bend . I nearly killed my own brother . And I just want a chance to make things right . What do you want from me ? You spent 20 years tracking these people . I want to know how you did it . What is all this stuff ? This is the last 20 years of my life . And you kept it . It 's hard to throw this stuff away . Noah , I am the US Government . We have loads of weapons and stuff . I realize you don 't need weapons , but you need perspective and you need to control information . In 30 seconds , you undid a secret that we 've kept for over 30 years . I can 't un-ring that bell . I know you can 't . Okay . Look , I joined the Company for a reason , and that reason doesn 't disappear just because your mother decides to turn off the lights . I thought you 'd enjoy the extra time with your family . There 's only so many crossword puzzles I can do . He planned it all with Nathan . They did it together . Did you hear what I just said ? Your brother is to blame for all of it . Yeah , I know . So ? So ? So what ? I tried to stop him , it didn 't happen . Okay . But what are we gonna do , nothing ? Well , we can 't do anything from memories , can we ? I 've never done this before . It 's not an exact science . It 's not science at all , Matt . You wanna go , just go . That 's not what I 'm saying . No , but it 's what you 're thinking . You think you deserve this , to be hunted , after all that you 've done . You 're reading my mind ? I don 't have to read your mind . You 're an open book . Look , you want to get caught ? Fine , turn yourself in . But we 're not lugging our baggage . I could say the same thing about you . I told you this is not about Daphne ! Stop ! Both of you . We 're supposed to be on the same side . You don 't think what I 'm getting here is real ? Fine . Fine . Storage unit . Combination lock . In here , it is filled with things we need , guns , money ... Go . Go ! I 'll go . Try not to kill one another . Jackpot . Sir , I think I have something . Where ? Gotcha . Where is he ? Costa Verde , breaking into Bennet 's storage facility . It 's a live feed ? Yeah . I 've got a local team on the move to apprehend him . How does he know about Bennet 's storage facility ? Are they working together ? I 'm reserving judgment . I want him caught . He 's in a room stocked full of guns . Am I clear ? You 're risking your own men 's lives . I want Peter caught . No bloodshed . You gentlemen hear that ? - Phasers on stun . - Yes , sir . We lost visual . Go ! Now ! Peter should 've been back by now . Yeah , just give him some more time . I 'll tell you why Peter isn 't here . He 's been captured or killed . Shut him up . I never checked in . They 'll be looking for me by now . Come on , do it . Mohinder knows I 'm right . My storage unit is under surveillance . You sent Peter right where they wanted him . He 'd say anything to get the hell out of here . That doesn 't mean I 'm lying . And you know me well enough to know that 's true . Matt , we should go . He 's right . Your only hope is to let me go and escape while you can , Matt . Wait a second , I 'm not finished . You said you check in . With who ? Who else are you working with ? Show me . I 'm not letting you in my head . You can 't stop me . Who is it ? Come on , who is it ? Welcome to Building 26 . I see the government spares no penny . Not on equipment , not on personnel . We 're building an elite team . Well , I 'm glad to be part of it . Now , there are a few ground rules that I would like to implement . Primatech had a system . One of us , one of them . Working alongside people with abilities . It helps to even the odds . Yes , I read your files . I think we 'd be better served with one of us and one of us . I 'm sorry ? Or 10 of us , 12 of us , and none of them . A lot of the people you 're targeting are good people . They 're useful people . Well , this isn 't about ethics . It 's about trust . About us and them . By your own admission , your way didn 't exactly work . Prisoners escaping , loyalty issues ... It was a mess . A mess ? For 20 years , I was successful in making sure that people like you never knew people like them even existed . Do not presume to know anything about me . I thought I was running this operation . Well , the situation has become a little bit more complex , Noah . It 's important that we look at everything from as many angles as we can , okay ? Glad to see you got your old job back . How else would I randomly bump into old acquaintances ? Something big is happening . I need your help . Why would I believe anything you say ? Because it 's true . I realize we haven 't always played nice with each other , but you have a unique perspective . You 've been ordinary and extraordinary , so you understand our fear . What exactly is happening ? A government program . And it is going to blow up in their face . I need you Mohinder . I need your brain , I need your strength . Together , we can help people , we can save lives . What do you say ? He came to you . What ? I just saw you and him in a cab . You knew about this . You didn 't tell him ? All right , Matt , let me explain . Why didn 't you tell him ? I wasn 't talking to anybody . I thought it was the safest thing . That 's why you didn 't want me in his head . You didn 't care about his health . You were afraid of what I 'd find . No . Yes , he approached me . But I said no ! You should have told me about this . Why didn 't you tell me ? What could I have done ? I was tied up on that plane , too . You think I don 't regret any of this ! You were my friend ! You could have warned me ! You could have warned all of us ! I didn 't know what to do . I didn 't believe him ! Even after the plane , the least you could ... What ? Told you that I could 've stopped all of this , that I could have maybe prevented Daphne 's death ? If I had , I 'd probably be the one tied up in that chair . Come on ! All right , check back there . I got over here . Hi . We got to hurry . They found me , they 're gonna find us . We 're gonna get all the answers we 're looking for , without the drugs . I want him to feel everything . How do we fight back ? You always have a plan , now you 're gonna share it with us . Listen to Peter , get the hell out of here while you still can . How much time do you think you have , Matt , before they find us ? Maybe we should just take what Peter has and run . You don 't get a vote ! What are you talking about ? Nothing ! Mohinder knew that we were gonna get attacked by the government . Is that true ? Bennet came to me , yes , but I didn 't believe him . He manipulated me before , and I didn 't think I could trust him . Why didn 't you say something ? As if any of you would believe me , after what I 've done . Yeah , it 's better that we didn 't . Look , come on . You 're a coward ! Can you get anything more out of him ? Yeah . I was just about to do that . Who 's the guy you were taking orders from ? Wait , wait . What guy ? I thought he was in charge . Turns out he 's still middle management . Who is he ? Who ? Who ? You . Got a minute ? I think we got off on the wrong foot . I was hoping we could talk . What are we gonna talk about ? We 're gonna be working together . I thought maybe it 'd be a good idea if we ... What ? Got to know each other better ? ... understood where the other guy was coming from . I already know where you 're coming from . And where is that ? You got a family at home . A wife , a boy , and your daughter , Claire , right ? She 's the special one with a soft spot in the Senator 's soft heart . That 's right . You 're a dime a dozen , and 11 out of 12 are unreliable . You don 't know anything about me . That 's the whole point of this , you know ? All that time you worked at your company , you danced the fine line between company man and family man . I 'm not much for dancing . You 're over-simplifying it . I think you 're over-complicating it . Hunting them or harboring them . To win this war for good , it takes focus , and yours is just a little split right now . I 've read your files , too , Mr. Danko . I 've known men like you . Is that right ? Sure . Simple , unconnected , take your work home with you , you 're never off the job . You think that makes you perfect . Not perfect , just better than you . These aren 't terrorist you 're hunting , they 're people . They 're targets . This job is about understanding their humanity , not their ability . But you have to be human to do that . You 're a valuable asset , but once we begin engagement , I have to know , are you gonna take orders , or continue undermining me with every glance ? You 're the boss . Matt , don 't do this . Don 't push this any further . Peter , I got another address for you . No . What is it ? What did you see ? No . You go after this guy and you 're dead . You 're all dead , you can 't undo it . This guy 's in charge . Don 't listen to him . This is why we came . We want to cripple them , we want to hurt them . This is the guy . No , Peter . You 're making a big mistake . You 're unraveling things you don 't understand . Peter ! Peter ! Secure all the exits . Wait for my order before moving in . I want eyes on the scene . You really should lock your windows . Sir , we have a situation . Tell me you found Bennet . No , sir , not Bennet . Did you mobilize a unit ? I was waiting for your order , Senator . So you 're the one who 's driving all this . Making us run , hide . Peter , right ? You 're the good brother , the passionate one . You want me dead ? Huh ? Do it . You want to die ? No . But you came here with a mission , right ? So ? Get it over with . You think you 're innocent , that you 're the good guy ? You broke into my house , put a gun to my head ! You 're the one who is hunting us . For good reasons . And it 's not ever gonna stop . 'Cause if you kill me , I 'll get exactly what I want . And what is that ? They 'll see what I 've been telling them . They 'll know just how dangerous you people are . He 's right , you know . Hello , Nathan . Don 't do it , Pete . How the hell did you get here so fast ? I know you might think I 'm the bad guy here , Pete , and maybe I am . But you 've got to believe me when I tell you ... I don 't . I 'm done believing in you . This isn 't you . All right . If you kill him , the order will come down to kill you all , and I won 't be able to contain ... Just shut up ! Shut up ! Let me figure a way out of this . That 's right . You can 't trust either of us . Not really . They 're moving in on Matt and Mohinder right now . You pull the trigger , you 're signing their death warrant . Why did you tell him about Parkman and Suresh ? I just saved your life ! You 're welcome ! Move in . Take them now ! Go . Empty . They don 't know which room we 're in . We should make a break for it . You 're never gonna stop hunting us . Even when you had the chance to stop , you didn 't . Daphne 's alive , Matt ! They have her , alive . You 're lying to me ! No , no , no , no , no . See for yourself . I won 't fight you . I go back inside your head right now , and we get caught . Go in . Find out . I 'll hold them off . It 's what you 've wanted . All right , go . This one 's alive . Gun shot wound to the shoulder . Got a sedative ? It 's gonna take three times the normal amount to keep this one down . Daphne 's alive , Matt . Come on . I said , come on , all of you . Matt , listen to me , you 're not a killer . This is only gonna get worse for you . You 're gonna have to escalate beyond anything you could ever imagine . You should have just taken the damn watch and stayed home . Drop it ! All right , don 't hurt him ! Is there anyone else here ? No , just me . Let me walk him out . Just let me walk him out . Take a hard look at yourself before you judge me . Wasn 't too long ago you had me tied up . Don 't use me to rationalize your actions . What I did , what you 're doing , is wrong ! The curtain is up . The government is involved in this now . What you did with Peter , what Matt did , he got in the way of what I 'm trying to accomplish . And what 's that , exactly ? The plane you were on , that was taking you to a facility that was meant to contain you . Well , your actions supported the hardliners who believe you should all be executed . Me ? I still believe containment can work . You 're gonna round us up and imprison us forever ? That 's your plan ? That 's the first part . Then we 're gonna find a way to control these powers . Eliminate them , so we can go back to living what 's left of our lives . But I need your help . That 's not gonna happen . You believe science has all the answers , right ? Why don 't you start with her ? Daphne . She is alive . For now . But I 'm losing that battle . And unless you help me , I can assure you , my associates are gonna kill her . And then they 're gonna kill you . And then they 're gonna kill my brother and Matt . You 'll all be dead . Protocol after a man 's taken prisoner is to grant him shore leave . Maybe you ought to take a few days off . My wife kicked me out of the house , my daughter 's scared to death of me , what am I gonna do with time off ? You were right before when you said I was weak because of my split focus . That 's not gonna be a problem any more . The job is all that 's left . You have my complete dedication . You still think I 'm compromised ? They found your storage unit . Which , unless I 'm mistaken , led you right to them . You 're the one that let them get away . Yeah , I admit . I underestimated them . They got away because Senator Petrelli let his personal interests cloud his judgment . Kid gloves are standard issue in this outfit . You and I have to change that . You agree ? Absolutely . So ? All things considered , went pretty well . And I think he trusts me . Don 't be foolish , Noah . That man trusts no one . He will continue to test you . I 'm prepared to be tested . Because he 's got it all wrong , and so does Nathan , for that matter . There 's no halfway any more . You 're gonna have to play the role , make tough choices , to prove your loyalty to them , to their cause . You know me . I 've always been comfortable with morally gray . No . No , no , this can 't happen . All I wanted to do is find Daphne . This is why I didn 't want to paint the future . Matt . Matt . You 're not capable of this , okay ? You are not a murderer . How the hell do you explain this ?

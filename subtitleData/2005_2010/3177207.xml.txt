 { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } Cover the eye that we didn 't treat . What do you see ? - Nothing . - Gonna get your optic nerves to grow . I don 't know if that eye can take another procedure . - We could do the other eye . - And risk going blind in both of them ? { \ pos ( 192,230 ) } They looked everywhere . Looks like one living , 10 dead , 13 missing . We need NorBAC to answer 3 questions . Is this outbreak contagious ? What 's the cause ? And is it safe to evacuate ? What happened to your crew ? - I don 't know . - What kind of cargo ? It 's coltan . It 's used in cell phones , TVs , DVD players . They unloaded all this stuff in Miami ? 1.3 million kilos onboard , now being dispersed on trucks . I found the remnants of an insect 's skin under the fingernail scrapings . We might have a variant on the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever . CCHF is tick-borne . No ticks were found . - Are they tick wounds ? - I don 't know what these are . - That 's not good . - No . - Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever ? - A variant . - What kind ? - It killed a boatload of sailors and it doesn 't respond to Ribavirin in vitro . Okay . I need to talk with my tropical medicine people . - Hey . - Hey . How is he ? He 's not presenting any symptoms yet . I cut 3 maggots out of him . Oh , nice . Any idea about the species ? I did a quick database check . But so many of them look alike . - U of T entomology ? - I sent them over . Okay . Any books you 've been wanting to read ? They should be putting me on hemodynamic support , ECG , monitoring fluid balances , electrolyte levels ... I 'll make sure it 's all taken care of . - We 'll test the blood and the insect . - Just try to relax . So how 'd he get bitten ? He was wearing a hazmat suit . Maybe above deck before he put it on . Fuck , there 's another one ! Watch out ! - What was he doing up there ? - Take pictures and let 's get out . Check his suit when you get back to the lab . Yeah , okay . ReGenesis 3x12 Jacobson 's Organ Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Dapitch666 , Bbsiocnarf , Linwelin Version BIO 1.0 { \ pos ( 150,258 ) } Shit . { \ pos ( 250,258 ) } Hey , it 's Mayko . My computer just crashed . { \ pos ( 150,258 ) } Could you take a look at it for me ? { \ pos ( 150,258 ) } Okay , thanks . Maggot ID as Dermatobia hominis , human botfly . What ? Hell ! I don 't know . Juice out of the wall is clean . Power supply is ticking . Well , what ... I mean , what is it then ? - Could it be a virus maybe ? - I don 't think so . - I enhanced our firewall last month . - That explains it . Rachel called and asked about Carlos 's blood . I sent the data to the UHN . They 're going to run it for me . Look , do you mind if I use your computer to run some research on these maggots ? No , as long as you don 't kill it . She 's a bit of a Dr. Kevorkian with computers around here . Funny . I knew a girl blew two computers in one day . Turned out to be her braces . David ? Yeah , Bob ? - Thanks for letting me stay here . - No problem . - Do you mind if I keep the light on ? - Go for it . - It 's just a habit . - Sure . David ? Yeah , Bob . - I think I lost my toothbrush . - It 's okay . I 've got an extra one . David . Go to sleep , Bob . - Okay . Good night . - Good night . Come on , Mayko . How could you have all those computers go wrong on you ? God , I 've had , like , two hours of sleep . Please don 't start on me , too . - All right , sorry . - You 're lucky , ' cause I have good news . - It 's a botfly maggot . - Botfly ? This is actually pretty cool . See , a botfly wants to lay its eggs in you . But it actually uses another insect to do the dirty work . In Africa , it likes to use ticks . So it lays its eggs on the tick 's legs . - Okay . - And when the tick lands on a person , botfly eggs can actually sense that person 's body heat and this cues the botfly eggs to hatch . And then out comes this tiny larva . - What , that fast ? - Yeah , that fast . So the larva drops off the tick 's legs , onto the person , and then it burrows under the skin - where it begins to grow . - Into a maggot , I get it . Maggot turns into a boil . As it grows , the person goes crazy with itching , scratches off the boil , out pops a big , juicy maggot . What about the hemorrhagic fever ? It must have come the old-fashioned way . From a tick bite . - In Africa ? - Yeah , in Africa . Because there were no ticks on the boat , right ? Right . What about Carlos ? Well , no ticks on the boat so ... the botflies needed some other insect to transport the eggs . So it could have been a good old American housefly ? Plenty of those on board . What about Carlos 's blood work ? I haven 't heard back yet , but I 'll ask Rachel { \ when I see her } . Never mind , I 'll do it . Hey , wait . Where are you ? Rachel . - Carlos 's blood ? - Just got the results . Oh , and those hazmat suits ? Carlos had a 3-centimeter rip under his left arm . Big door for a fly . - This had better be good news . - No hemorrhagic fever . Yes ! Gracias a Dios . You were lucky . - What ? I still work for you . - Nice . Get your ass in here . - Hey , we have to go . Where 's Bob ? - I rode my bike . - Thought you were picking him up . - You said you were . - I didn 't . - You did ! - Let 's just go get him . - You 're losing it , Sandstr√∂m . How you doing , Bob ? - Just thinking . - About what ? When we first came to Canada , my mother kept all the lights off at night . She and I used to sit in the kitchen with this little green lamp . We would read by it ... between us . I learned English and then I taught it to her . - What was your father doing ? - Working , working . I only ever saw him on weekends . Bob , are you ready ? Very . Good luck . Need you to keep still . When I got my own apartment , I took the lamp with me . I still read by it . Need you to keep your eyes closed . Okay . Hang on there . Okay . All right , Bob . You can open them . I can see . A little bit . I mean , I think it 's good . How good ? Better than before my accident . I think . I love your perfume . Thank you . - Need you to look at this light here . - Okay . Follow it . Good . - How 's it look ? - Left . Good , good . All right . See that chart over there ? Cover your eye . Can you read it for me ? F , E , L , O , P , Z , D. That 's the seventh line down . 25 / 20 . I can see , David . - Are you ready ? - Whenever you are . - I need to speak to David . - Hey , how 's Bob ? Better than perfect vision in the treated eye . - He 's doing terrific . - That 's fantastic . We left him at David 's . He needs to chill and relax . But he 's so happy . - He 's calling his relatives . - What great , great news . - Mayko , do you have a second ? - I 'll see you later . Oh , David . I just got a call from the New York Stock Exchange . They 're having problems with their computers . - Why us ? - It 's been a few weeks - it 's starting to spread . - Send it to the ATF lab or somewhere . They did . They sent it to Livermore . It 's covered by an organic slime . - Like a biofilm ? - Exactly . - It 's all over the main circuit board . - What kind of biofilm ? I guess that 's why they 're calling us in . Alright . Have them send it up in a bio-bag . We got enough computer problems of our own . It 's already here . Carlos is looking at it . Well , thanks for keeping me in the loop . You 're welcome . Bob 's optic nerve . What we want is for that nerve to grow . Frankly , we 're trying to drive a car with a brake on . We produce an siRNA , which effectively eliminates the brake . One key will be fine . Thanks . You 're getting very good at this . What took you so long ? Traffic . - How are you , Jonny ? - Good . I 'm good . Here are your husband 's files . - You have something ? - Yeah . Yeah . I 've got boxes full of dead ends . What ? I know that this is not what you wanted to hear . A month ago , you told me that everything looked promising . And every time I was on to something , suddenly it just curved into darkness . Your husband , I mean , this guy ... This guy knows how to cover his tracks . You told me you could uncover them . I didn 't say that I could walk on water . So you 're telling me that you have nothing ? Nothing that 's admissible in court , nothing that the Justice Department 's - gonna find of any interest . - What about the Sinatra virus ? I fed you all that dirt that said he was steering it towards Kay Pharmaceuticals . You know what they did ? They paid him cash , and cash can be put into ... a gym bag . Cash can be put into a safety deposit box . I mean , maybe he stashed it in the Caymans . I ... Rachel ... I 've been doing this for you for 6 months and I have found nothing . What the fuck ? I mean ... Turn it over to the FBI . What the hell is going on ? This is all very exciting , but we 're not out of the woods yet . We gotta do exactly what Dr. Turnbull says . - I can 't just sit here . - Just put on your iPod and zone out . - Impossible . - You spend half your time zoned out . I don 't know how to put this nicely , - but it smells in here . - I 'll open a window . You 'll have to get rid of that couch . Why ? There are about 50 different kinds of perfume embedded in the cushions . - Really . - David . I 'm underestimating . You never used to complain about the perfume on my couch before . - I guess I have too much time . - I 'll move the couch . I 'll put a cover on it . But if you cooperate , I 'll cook you something special . Seafood . I can smell it . It 's in the fridge . Unidentified 3-day-old crustacean . No thanks . What ? David , we have electron microscope images of the biofilm . And ? You should take a look at this . Okay , first thing tomorrow morning . No , I mean like right now . Why , what is it ? The bacterium from the New York Stock Exchange . - I 've never seen anything like this . - I 'll be right in . What the fuck 's going on with the lights ? Don 't know . I was in the middle of doing an EM scan when the power went down . - Backup generator kick in okay ? - Yeah , exactly as it should have . Okay . So . Here is the surface of the circuit board . That 's the bacteria that forms the biofilm ? Take a look at them when we zoom in . See , they all seem to be oriented in exactly the same direction . - Like they 're marching in formation . - Precisely . Working together to gum up the circuit board . As if programmed . Okay , let 's get Rachel back in here , see if we can identify this crud . Hey , Bob . What are you working on ? Ah , some kind of magnetic ... - What are you doing here ? - I 'm back . I 'm ready for work . David , I 'm fine . I know I am . I want to have the other eye done . Okay , hold on a second . - Let 's just make sure that ... - David , I am sure . Everything has worked perfectly . I wanna have the other eye done . - Okay . Welcome back . - Thank you . What do you know about magnetic bacteria ? - Which ones ? - Any ones . Well , they 've only been studied for a couple of years . But they 're these very esoteric microorganisms that align themselves with the Earth 's magnetic field . Family : Nitrospiraceae , Genus : Magnetobacterium . They 're gram-negative proteobacteria that can live in anoxic sediments . Magnetobacterium ? Yeah . Probably only a handful of scientists have even seen them . So we 're among the chosen few . What do they do ? They have magnetosomes inside of them which are made of iron crystals . And that 's the part that 's attracted to magnetic fields . The world 's smallest compasses ? Capacitors store electrical charges on circuit boards . And that charge means there 's also a magnetic field there . Like lighthouses sending out a beacon to these things . They follow the beacon back to the lighthouse ... - And they burn it down . - So how are they burning it down ? Well , the bacteria does produce an extra-cellular polysaccharide . It 's a gluey-like slime that holds the biofilm together . The biofilm then coats the circuit board ... The circuit board short-circuits . Brilliant . - There are some troubling details . - Like what ? Magnetic bacteria can only exist in an anaerobic environment . Oxygen kills them . So they should be dead . Here 's what we do . Rachel , you figure out how they 're surviving in oxygen . Bob , you figure out what they 're eating . Carlos , Mayko , extermination . Okay , what the fuck is going on around here ? Maybe the biofilm has contaminated NorBAC . Is that a stupid idea ? Oh , shit . Everybody back up your hard drives . Okay , so this is a circuit board that IT pulled out of your computer , Mayko . So the circuit boards here at NorBAC and the ones at the New York Stock Exchange are both being attacked by the same magnetobacteria . But how did it end up here ? Maybe the magnetobacteria from New York contaminated us ? That 's not possible . My computer crashed before the circuit boards got here . This is just coincidence ? No , I 'd say that more than just Mayko 's computers are infected by now . I 'll get on Maintenance and get them to change all our circuit boards . We just need to figure out a connection between us and the NY Stock Exchange . Maybe their common supplier , product , software . - I 'll get on it . - I need the name of every lab working with magnetobacteria . Maybe somebody there can help us . I should 've gone into law . - David . - Yeah . We did tests within the lab . Circuit boards in the ventilation system ... infected . - There goes my BlackBerry . - I 've got something on how it survives . A little audiovisual aid . But we better do it quick . All right . This is the sequence of the magnetobacteria 's DNA . This is the area that controls sensitivity to oxygen . - Somebody fuck with it ? - They 've added superoxide dismutase , catalase and peroxidase . All the enzymes needed to survive in oxygen . Shit . Who 's working on this ? There 's 4 U.S. labs : Cat 's Research , New Age Metallurgy , Northern Sky Laboratories and KMM Industries . All of them are above board . Mayko 's contacting them . - Think I found something interesting . - What ? I did an analysis on all the substances found in a capacitor . The key components , aluminum , - silicon , copper , gold , mica ... - Just tell me what you got , Bob . Tantalum . Tantalum ? - And where do you get tantalum ? - It 's refined from ore . Coltan . What the sailors infected with that hemorrhagic were hauling . All roads lead to Africa . - See ? I told you it was interesting . - 1.3 million kilos smuggled out of the Congo basin . Now we got a bug that 's attracted to tantalum capacitors . What the fuck ? I 'm gonna keep working on the magnetobacterium . We gotta kill it . - I 'll help you . - Wes , you work with Mayko . Anything on those companies . Just leave that . - I wanna take a closer look . - Sure . Wes . - You have a minute ? - Yeah , of course . What do you need ? When you were talking about those labs , dealing with magnetobacteria , - something twigged for me . - What ? Years ago , Carl worked for a drilling company called Ursa Minor Drilling . Which I remember because it 's a constellation . The Little Dipper . But also because its sister company 's name is a play on where it can be seen . Northern Sky Laboratories . Magnetobacteria . Exactly . So Ursa Minor had retained Carl as a lobbyist to get permission to drill in this very environmentally sensitive area of the Boreal Shield in Manitoba . I wonder what they were drilling for . Three guesses . First two don 't count . Tantalum . I 'm gonna keep working on the magnetobacterium , see if we can kill it . - Yeah , I 'll help you . - Wes , work with Mayko . Anything on those companies . Just leave that . - I wanna take a closer look . - Sure . Wes . - You have a minute ? - Yeah , of course . What do you need ? What 's up , Bob ? It 's Rachel . - Rachel ? What about her ? - She 's scared or excited or ... - something . - What 're you talking about ? When she walked by me , I could just tell . Well , we 're all pretty hopped up right now . We have to bring David in on this . - And I think it 's a bad idea . - Bad idea to bring me in on what ? Come on , Rachel . You just finished telling Wes I should get involved , so ... Carl Riddlemeyer on the take ? We think that Riddlemeyer is siphoning off data from NorBAC for high-tech firms and collecting a finder 's fee . - Why am I just hearing about it now ? - We wanted to catch him with his hand in the cookie jar , not smack him over the head . How 'd you get onto him ? I knew he was hiding money from me from when we did the divorce settlement , - and one thing led to another . - Who else is in on it ? - That 's what we 're trying to find out . - I hired a forensic accountant . He 's been going through Carl 's transactions , trying to link him to something . He came up with these leads , but so far none have panned out . And then this tantalum thing came up . And we think Carl may be running a scam - to manipulate the market . - Carl doesn 't know we 've made the connection , so hopefully he hasn 't covered his tracks . And the evidence may still be in these files . Weston Field . Yeah , thanks . Riddlemeyer 's flying back this afternoon . - Good timing . - All right , best behaviour , David . Actually , I think it 's time you threw a match into Carl 's gas tank . This circuit board is from the mainframe at LAX air traffic control . Three other major airports were hit . Philadelphia , Chicago and Seattle . All of them infected with magnetobacteria ? If they were , it represents a major escalation . Thousands of people were caught midair . We just narrowly averted a catastrophe . - Have you found a way to kill it ? - Not just yet . Well , how about the way it spread ? That 's still unclear as well , but we 're working on it . Okay , well , who 's behind it ? Any idea ? Now that is an interesting question . - You know who it is ? - No . But we have found some clues . Such as ? Have you ever heard of tantalum ? It 's to do with electronics . Capacitors . So you know it 's a highly prized mineral . I do have some knowledge of the mining industry . Well , the thing is , tantalum is derived from coltan . When you check your records , you 'll see we were just dealing with an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever onboard a freighter - that was just loaded with coltan . - I fail to see the connection . With all this magnetobacteria running around fucking up tantalum capacitors , there 's gonna be a panic and the market for raw coltan is going to skyrocket . Whoever 's sitting on a supply is looking to make a killing . That shipment alone could be worth billions . And it 's out there somewhere , on a fleet of 18-wheelers . It 's just a matter of time till we track it down . Yeah so , to answer your question , no , we don 't know who would engineer the magnetobacteria yet . But what we do have is a damn good motive . - Money . - Keep me posted . Sure . Maybe you could look into this for us . I mean , get Washington to put a couple of spooks on it . Sure . You know , Carl , whoever is behind this is a real fuckhead . He better pray that we can figure out how to shut this thing down . Because if we can 't , there won 't be a single fucking toy left for him to spend his billions on . You don 't think I 'm a fuckhead , do you , David ? Of course not , Carl . I think you 're king of the fuckheads . And to recap our top story , planes are grounded in Los Angeles , Chicago , Philadelphia and Denver as engineers search for answers as to what caused flight navigation systems to crash . - It 's spreading . - Yeah , I know . I heard Wall Street spent millions replacing circuit boards . - What 's wrong ? - What do you mean ? You 're frightened . Yeah , actually . So what 's up ? I don 't know . It 's probably none of my business . Bob , no . I just ... I was thinking , you know , what if these bacteria got into the mainframe at some nuclear power station ? That 's all . - That is scary . - Yeah . And happy ? - What ? - Why are you happy ? I 'm just glad you 're back . That 's nice . - Hello , Mr. Riddlemeyer . - Dr. Melnikov . Dr. Tran . - He was terrified . - I didn 't get that impression . It was obvious to me . Thanks . We need to talk . David ? That match you threw into Riddlemeyer 's gas tank ? Looks like it just went off . Come on . See ? - Sometimes it pays to play with fire . - As close as I can figure , Riddlemeyer came out of your office , got into an elevator , placed a phone call . Really ? So the question is did he make it to somebody who fits into all this ? - Exactly . You remember Kayne ? - Oh , yeah . You traced those smallpox calls for us . How you doing ? Good , thanks . Kayne has tapped into all of Riddlemeyer 's outgoing phone calls . - Take a look at this . - Bing-fucking-o . - What 's your next step ? - I 'm gonna look at these files . Rachel 's gonna set something up . Okay . Keep me informed . And remember , nobody plays hero . - Got a minute ? - For you ? So I 've been in contact with four labs working with magnetobacteria . They are forwarding a list of anyone they think could be considered - an individual of interest . - CC Wes anything from Northern Sky . Wes . Why ? It 's need-to-know , and right now you don 't . Okay , fine . I 'm sorry . Just trust me on this . I 'll explain later . Anyway , there 's something else . I need to talk to you about Bob . Have you noticed anything odd about his behaviour ? - Every time we talk . - No , I mean like strange-strange . Okay . Bob seemed to know what I was feeling . - Sounds like love . - I 'm serious . I know it sounds stupid , - it 's like he could read my emotions . - He has Asperger 's , Mayko . I mean , empathy isn 't something his brain processes . Maybe it does now . You 'd think all this pizza smell would silence my nose , but it doesn 't . So , what do you want to tell me ? - Tell you ? - Yeah , you 're anxious . You want to tell me something . Well , Bob , okay . People are talking . - About what ? - About you . Me ? Why ? What are they saying ? They think you 're acting differently . Like you 're , I don 't know , more sensitive to their emotions . Well , I 'm finding it a little easier to understand what people are saying . And what they 're not saying . I don 't know what 's going on , David . All I do know is that I don 't want it to stop . Yeah ... I think we should go back to Dr Turnbull and have a little chat with her . The amazing thing is people , David . Their faces show one thing , but there 's so much else going on . See ? Your face suggests that you are happy . But actually , you are worried . Don 't be . Okay , so this is LAX computer 's motherboard . - There 's the magnetobacteria . - Right . No surprise there . I have a theory about this biofilm I 'd like to bounce off you . - Fire away . - Okay . Dead magnetobacteria . The cell walls have collapsed around the magnetosomes . Some of them were killed by the agents we introduced . No . See , that 's the thing . They 've actually died and formed protective layers on the surface of the biofilm . You 're thinking that they 're engineered to keep reproducing , then the carcasses form a protective layer , keeping them from the ultraviolet radiation , - or whatever we 're throwing at them . - Exactly . Like soldiers fighting behind a wall of dead comrades . This would have to be part of the engineering . - How the hell do they do that ? - I don 't know , but the answer has to be down there somewhere in the genome . Rachel Woods . Oh yeah , thanks for calling back . I think I might have something . Maybe we could get together . No , alone . Yes , that would be perfect . Okay , see you soon . Well . I thought I was never gonna hear from you again . Sorry , just cleaning up a few details . Don 't you mean tying up loose ends ? 'Scuse me ? I didn 't know you were in touch with Carl . What makes you think that I am ? Because , you know , it 's funny : every time he leaves a NorBAC meeting , he 's on a call to you . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I think the two of you are working together . On what ? Manipulating tantalum futures on pharmaceutical espionage ! Theft , fraud ... I don 't know , Jonny , you tell me . I can tell you that you 're way off base . You 'll not walk away from this . You can either talk to me or to the Justice Department . You hired me to investigate your husband and I found nothing . And now you stand here and give me shit ? Are you really that stupid ? This thing that Carl is working on , the magnetobacteria . It is insanity ! And it 's escalating . It 's not just gonna stop at airport closures and stock manipulations . God knows where this thing is gonna go ! I have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . So he got to you , didn 't he , Jonny ? All right , well , you can walk away from this one . But you gotta give me something . At least let me try and stop him . This is bad , yes ? This is really bad . People could die . A lot of people . There 's a numbered company in the Caymans . That account ... is the tip of your iceberg . You 'll keep my name out of this ? I 'm gonna tell anyone who cares to listen that you came to your senses . You know what ? You 're worried about this magnetobacteria . I 'm worried about somebody getting a bullet in the back of the head . Good night , Rachel . Hey . You okay ? Been better . What 's this ? Numbered Cayman Island company . Relates to the coltan shipment . It 's exactly what I 've been looking for . Where 'd you get this ? Rach ? You know , all this time , I 've been wanting to catch him , just hoping that he would slip up , - and we 're almost there . - Almost . So why don 't I feel better ? Maybe because he was your husband for 25 years . It just got so big . He pushed it so far . You 're doing the right thing . You think ? I 'm gonna get onto this numbered company . Okay . Thanks . Remember when all we had for a brain scan was an EEG ? Yeah . - That feel okay ? - Perfect . Okay . This is the optical array . If you could just help me out here , make sure it works . This 'll stimulate your retina so we can track the brain activity in your visual cortex . And if it works okay , we can insert nano-trellises into the other eye . That 's what I 'm hoping for . Enjoy the show . So this is the MRI of Bob 's brain . And this is the geodesic sensor net 's output . The optic nerve from the eye that we treated is firing beautifully . - I 'm feeling odd , David . - Why , what 's the matter ? - Are you a little claustrophobic ? - It 's very uncomfortable . Just hang in there for a little bit longer , Bob . What is this here ? - Structure below the frontal lobes . - I don 't know . Whatever it is , I 've never seen it active in any other brain scan . - David , I think I need to leave . - Bob , just relax , breathe . - Bob , it 'll be all right . - I 've to get out of here . He 'll be all right . We 'll call you . Bob ! - I don 't know what came over me , David . - Listen to me , Bob . Clearly , there is something going on in your brain . You can 't just become empathic and deal with feelings if you 've never encountered them before . That brain scan will give us a clue as to what 's happening . We just need to pin it down . David , I know this sounds weird , but when I panicked back there Just forget about it . It 's over . - But Dr. Turnbull ... - What about her ? It wasn 't exactly panic . It was something else . I must have really upset her . I should call and apologize . David . You had better come in here . What 's up ? We were doing some scans on the magnetobacteria . - Take a look at the magnetosome . - Yeah ? - What are those ? - That 's exactly what we asked . I thought it might be related to how the biofilm was formed , how it could be dirt . So I decided to take a closer look . A smiley face . I hear you 're looking for someone . I think I can help . That 's Robbie McCain 's calling card . But Robbie McCain is dead . Yeah , but he was working with the DARPA lab synthesizing smallpox . - Could they be involved ? - No , he stole the smallpox from them . They had nothing to do with his terrorism . Is this a signature of a terrorist group that Robbie McCain was a part of ? I got a bigger question for you . If Carl Riddlemeyer is somehow involved with all this magnetobacteria bullshit , was he involved with the smallpox , too ? You want me to go to the Washington Post and tell them that Carlton Riddlemeyer , the science Czar of the USA , is behind acts of biological terrorism for financial gain . Fine . Call the New York Times . Cornering the market on tantalum is one thing , but threatening to shut down the world 's electronic infrastructure and a smallpox outbreak , that 's just not Carl . All right , all right . What 're we looking at ? I mean , okay ... Robbie McCain 's calling card shows up . Clearly , Robbie McCain was not working alone . So we know that Carl was tied into a tantalum scam , and Jonny Frank 's guy , he gave you that numbered company . He said that was just the " tip of the iceberg " , right ? And we know that Riddlemeyer has connections to Northern Sky , one of only four labs in the United States that 's working with the magnetobacteria . I don 't know . Yet . Look , have Mayko look into Robbie McCain . She already did . I mean dig deep . Everything . Where he went to day care . Who he took to the prom . Who the best man at his wedding was . And you 'll have another look at Northern Sky Laboratories . Find out exactly what they were doing with the magnetobacteria . Rachel , work with Carlos . We 've to find a way to stop this primordial goo before it shuts down every circuit board on the planet . What do they want ? The smiley face gang . Why haven 't they tried to contact me like during the smallpox scare ? Maybe ' cause they didn 't get what they wanted last time . But what about Riddlemeyer ? He 's connected to the magnetobacteria , but the smiley face people ? What 's that all about ? David 's right . The smallpox wasn 't about money . It was about principle . Carl doesn 't have a principle in his body . No offence . None taken . So then , he 's not connected ? No , he 's dirty all right . Something 's just not there . { \ pos ( 200,225 ) } I had some sort of breakdown . I 'm not sure . I think the virus is doing something more to Bob , and in particular his Jacobson 's Organ . You can 't be serious . The vomeronasal organ has been dormant in humans for millions of years . We 're shutting down the virus . David , don 't be angry or frustrated . Nothing makes sense , Bob . I don 't know what is going on ! - What do you know about smallpox ? - What 's the link with magnetobacteria ? - A smiley face . - I 'm sorry . Who 's behind the smallpox ? A million computer batteries are being recalled . They 're heating up , could explode . It 'll take a lot of tantalum to replace them . Holy ... Carl , I got a lot of work to do . - You gotta go . - What just happened ? He 's not in his apartment . Doesn 't look like he 's been there all night . - What about the police ? - They have a description . They also know the situation . Same with Immigration and Customs . Damn it ! If you do anything to Bob , I will find you . I 'll rip your head off !

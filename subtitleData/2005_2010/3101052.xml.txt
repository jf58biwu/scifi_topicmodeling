 Previously on heroes . My dad lied to me about my entire life . My biological parents.My ability . You can 't just hide things like that . A 21-year-old woman was killed in the explosion . Also killed in the fire was her 18-month-old daughter . Hi , I 'm looking for someone related to meredith gordon . - This is her . - Mom . Where are you taking us ? Tell your boss I 'm on very important mission . I work for someone ... Who has true power . And wants you to stop . Father ? It can take us * * * * * * * If you let me , I gonna help you ! What am you can * * * How can you see me ? I don 't know , I just do you can do . I * * * invisible * * * * get away * * * * I found you , I need you to help me . This entire city is in danger . You seem pretty sure about that pending apocalypse of yours . How many people have you taught before me ? That 's * * * you bring him back.Again and again . He is dead . Well , that 's less than ideal . I don 't see how petty theft is part of my training . There 's a lot you don 't see . You 've no idea how to use these gifts of yours properly . Yeah , and you do ? No , I- - right now , your abilities only show up as a reflex . Autonomic , like swallowing . That 's a dog 's trick . Making it a conscious choice , using it , that 's what makes you more than poodle . Is insulting me really gonna help me learn how to do that ? Listen , you 're the one who 's a bomb set to blow up me and everyone in this city unless I can get you housebroken . That 's right , now he 's listening . Now , you absorb all these abilities you find , yeah ? You 're invisible with me , you 've flown , you 've read some minds . Yeah , put me in a coma for two weeks . Your body doesn 't know what to do with them all . It 's gotten jumbled , like file cardsknocking around a shoebox . Except with you , the cards are dowsed in plutonium , piling up to a critical mass . Now , I 'm gonna teach youhow to pull ' em out , one at a time . You think that 's possible ? I hope so . Next time you shut down , it might not be just a coma . Might be the day you melt down . So then , let 's get to today 's lesson . All right , let 's start by seeing if you can hold on to one of your powers without your benefactors hanging around . You think I can do that alone ? We 're about to find out . Remember to breathe . Hey ! Chapter 14 " Distractions " God , it sounds like a bomb is about to go off . I know it 's hard . Just focus on the mirrorand try to relax . I can 't relax . You 're trying to bring her out . Jessica ... I told you . She is dangerous . She could hurt you . Tell me . Those cuffs could keep an elephant in that chair . And just ' cause I 'm a shrink , don 't think I don 't know how to use that taser . I thought that the goal was to get rid of her . The goal here is to bring your two halves to a healthy middle . To have a unified and whole you . Not two aspects at war . How do we do this ? Like I said , you focus on the reflection . And breathe . Come on . Feel free to let your mind wander . We used to have a piano in our home . You played ? Chopsticks , barely . My sister ... jessica . She played beautifully . I used to ... play with her sheet music . I didn 'T ... know what it was . It was just ... dots and lines . I would ... get out my crayons and connect the dots . Jessica used to say ... that I could turn mozart into a monkey . I sure did . Jessica . You should have listened to the little mouse . How 's claire ? That was for the haircut . You shouldn 't have built such a good cage . You go anywhere near her ... No ! No ! No ! You didn 't * * * your keys * * I shouldn 't have them.Not anymore . You started painting since you got back from rehab . Can I see ' em ? That 's not done yet ! Oh , god . That 's the roof of my father 's building . We had a lot of good memories up there . Is that how you remember our relationship ? With all of new york destroyed ? What are you looking for , simone ? It 's peter . He 's still missing . I 'm running out of places to look . You finally believe I can paint the future , . and you want to use it to find your new boyfriend I don 't wanna be asking you this either . Can you ? I have been . Except it 's not working . Every time I try to paint where peter is , I get nothing . You 've been trying to find him--why ? I know what he can do . He 's the one that 's gonnaturn new york into this . I 'm not gonna let him . How do you know so much about him ? Because I painted it . I care about you , simone , more than I knew how to say when ... when it would have made a difference . But right now , I don 't care if you hate me . I just want you safe.Stay away from peter . Just ... tell me you 'll look for him . I 'll try . Yeah . Simone ... keep the key . The manatee is on the brink of extinction . There 's one at the aquarium in lubbock , and the marine biologist said we could stop by any time . You 're asking my permissionto skip school ? No , if I wanted to skip school , I 'd check into home room and then sneak out ms.Roberts ' window . But you 've always stressed honesty , so I 'm being honest . The manatee 's a very noble creature . Is your car in working order , zachary ? Just had the oil changed . Any tickets ? Just parking . - You 'll be home for dinner . - Yes . That 's not a question . I 'm making fajitas . Zach , you 're welcome to join us . Let 's go . Come on . We 'll wait 15 minutes , and then head out . Do you have the directionsto kermit ? Uh , yeah.Look , what if your mom wants proof ? About the aquarium . Where did you get these ? Motel 6 lobby and my color printer . No one can know we 're goingto see my real mom . We have to be perfect . Your father looks angry . My father always looks angry . But your sister looks hot . For this you leave your job , take an unauthorized vacation . Gorge yourself on hamvurgers and waffles . Waffles are very good , You would like them . No , Hiro.I would not . No more distractions . You will come home.and you will get back to work . Father , I ... I am on an important mission . You are only on a plane home . You will return to Yamagato Industries . That is what is important . My job was meaningless I worked in a cubicle ! I only put you at the bottom so you would reach for the top . Perhaps I was too strict . When you return i will make you an Executive Vice President . On your way to taking my place as CEO . You are my only son , Hiro.This is your destiny . Father . I believe I have ... a different destiny . And what is that ? I have to bring that painting to a man in Las Vegas ... So I can steal Takezo Kensei 's sword ... Then use my powers to stop a bome from blowing up New York . Kensei From those stories ! read you ? If only I had the sword I could show you what I can do . Do you want to see what I think of your destiny ? We 'r going home . Get a doctor ! wait . What happened ? No ! ... I tried to tell her . Take me back to my cell ! Love to ! Thanks for almost getting me arrested . A little more focus , you 'd have had some cash and fresh lipstick . I never said it 'd be easy . In fact , I think I said repeatedly it 'd be crap . You been doing this for 15 years . Cut me a little slack on trying to do it for five minutes . You 'll learn . We just gotta find what 's holding you back . The cops have my nameand address . I 'm pretty sure nathan 's gonna kill me first anyway . You worry a lot about your people , don 't you ? Your friends , your mother , your brother . No wonder your head 's all clogged . You 're still sunk under . Under what ? Your attachments . All these people who feed you biscuits , pat your head , and tell you you 're not fit for the outdoors . You still see yourself through their eyes , is that it ? No , I don 'T . Right , well , I 'll bet you 20 bucks your dad didn 't make much of you either . God , you 're easy . We 've gotta get these people out of your head . Do you understand ? These people are my family . I can 't just cut ' em out . Of course- - peter can 't use his powers without someone holding his hands . How can you not punch that face every time you see it ? He 's not like that . He is , trust me . You don 't know him . I don 't need to . I spend a lot of time moving around people 's homes , their bedrooms . You get to know peopleif you see them when they think they 're alone . You see them for what they truly are : Selfish , deceitful , and gassy . So what is that , your big truth about the world ? Sooner you learn it , sooner we get that collar off your neck . People suck , friend . Every last one of them . Never forget that . Not all of them . Oh , right . There 's a girl . She 's not likethe rest of them . Everyone 's like the rest . That 's why they 're the rest . Fine , let 's go and see what your girl 's up to . Then maybe we can clear your head . Wait , you wanna ... spy on her ? Look , you can follow her all you want . I 'm telling you , she 's not like that . Well , then , no harm in taking a look . This is bad . What will we do ? Did you put on cologne ? Pleas , father , let me speak with him . Oh , Kimiko You have brought shame to our family.little brother . That was not my intention . Father doesn 't need me . You 'r the one he trusts . He thinks I 'm weird . Father is too proud to tell you ... There is trouble at Yamagato . And now the stockholders are saying if father can 't manage his own son ... How can he manage his business ? You are his only son.his heir , you must come home . How can I ? I have a mission . You are so busy pretending to save the world . What about saving your family ? Maybe you should think about it.your powers are gone . You have no way to get your sword.your family needs you . But ... I was a hero . Listen to Kimiko . She 's the smart one . Yes , she is ! This is it . Number 36 . Nice pinwheel collection . You know , I always imagined my parents would live in A ... penthouse in new york city . Not some trailer parking kermit . So she lives in a trailer . Maybe she likes the open road . Just not what I imagined . Stop imagining . She 's right there . What am I supposed to say ? " Hi , I 'm your daughter , and I can regrow my kidney " ? I mean , what if she 's got burns and scars from the fire ? She 's supposed to be dead , right ? So are you , remember ? You alreadygot that in common . Hey ... where are you going ? I 'm getting rid of your exit strategy . You 'll be fine . I 'll be back in time for fajitas . Claire ? Hi , little fluffy . Claire home from school yet ? No ? We 'll just wait . Now , what 's your name ? mr.Muggles ? Where are you , baby ? Mama 's home ! Of course . Let 's go say hi . I-I 'm sorry . Who are you ? I just came from the paper factory , ma 'am . I 'm just makin ' a delivery for your husband . And I saw ... this little guy ... in the street . Now , somebody must have left the back door open . Oh , I hope you don 't mind . I took the liberty . Well , aren 't you sweet ? And he was just out there in the yard ? Oh ... just chewing ' on a sprinkler head . Mm ! Who left those doors open , mr . Muggles ? Claire or lyle ? You tell me , so I can tan their ass . Well , thanks for inviting ' me in . I always wanted to , uh , see where mr . Bennett lived . It is so funny how all of y 'all call him mr . Bennett over there . I 've always just known him as- - stop that , you . No more shoes . He just discovered shoelaces . Can 't get enough . That 's funny , I never really imagined him as much of a dog person . I guess he just looms a little larger when he 's drilling ' you . He mostly talks about claire . I was hopin ' to meet her , actually . I 've heard so much about her . Well , she has promised to be home for dinner . Which meansa half an hour late . My son is at a tai kwon do sleepover tonight . That means an extra plate . Why don 't you stay for dinner ? Oh ... least I can offer my new hero . Are you sure ? It 's not too much trouble ? I will call my husband and tell him to expect you . - sylar . - What did you say your name was again , mister ... Oh , I don 't think you 'll reach him at the office , though . Last I saw , he was just swamped . I 'm staring . I 'm sorry . I mean , you have to understand . I never thought this would happen . You sitting inches away from me . You 're so beautiful . Thank you . You a good student ? Um , I 'm okay . Lousy at math . No help from me there . Well , I 'll bet you 're all kinds of popular . I was homecoming queen . Kind of . Damn , I missed so much . If I 'd known you were out there , but ... you must thinksomething awful . I mean , I was so sure that nothing could have survived that fire . It was a miracle that I did , and ... god , when I saw that roof , I ... don 't question the miracle , right ? Here . It 's horchata . I learned a secret recipe in mexico . It 's sweet . You lived in mexico ? Oh , I moved around a lot . After I lost you , I sort of started running . I never really stopped . And I only came back to kermit a couple months ago . I spent some time in cuernavaca . And la paz . You 've never been . Sorry . It 's my mom . Hi ! Yeah , we 're at the aquarium right now . They just let zach feed him turtle grass . We 're practically on our way . We 'll be home in , like , an hour . No , I won 't let him speed . Okay . Bye . She doesn 't knowyou 're here . She doesn 't really understand what 's going on with me right now . Neither of my parents do . Well , I 'll pretendI understand why you 'resneaking around . All girls deserve their secrets , right ? Seems like I have a lot of them these days . I have to show you something . You may understand it , you may not , but ... I need you to see . See what ? I think I know how I survived that fire . - It 's okay . - Claire , don 't ! Please say something . Some family . I told claire to get a move on . She said she 'd be back soon . A cheerleader , huh ? Co-captain by junior year . Wow . Although not so much these days . They dissolved the team ' cause of some ... horrible event at the school . Oh , I heard about that . That must have been hard on poor claire . You are awfully interested in my daughter . Well , ever since I seen what she can do , I guess you could say I 'm A ... fan . She 's really quite gifted . Oh , you 've been to a game ? Yeah , I guess I have . I just couldn 't get over those irresistible ... talents of hers . I should- - I should check with my husband again . Excuse me . I 'd rather you didn 't so I can surprise him . H-h-how did you do that ? I 'm special . Just like claire . Well , different . But ... you catch the meaning . It 's a shame I 'll have to kill her . Or maybe I 'll kill you first . I really haven 't decided yet . Hi . - He dies ! - Find him . I don 't understand what happened . Why was he- - he moved the phone without even touching it . Shh . You 're safe now . I 'm right here . I 'll find him . He kept asking about claire . Claire is fine . She 's safe too . And she 'll stay that way . I promise . Who is that ? This is my friend . He 's gonna make everything okay . He 'll help you forget again . Again ? What do you mean again ? It 's okay . Hold my hand . It 'll all be over soon . You could stay a little longer . Have some dinner . I can 't cook worth crap , but ... well , I was supposedto be home a while ago . I got about six messages from my dad telling me to come home right away , so ... He sounded pretty pissed . HEY , This isn 't good-bye . You know that . I was hoping you couldtell me about my father . Now , that 'S ... complicated . Why don 't you let me work on that for next time ? Some family . Here ... a little something from mexico . Oh , no , I can 'T . You can , and you 're gonna . It 'll look ten times better on you than it ever did on me . Isaac . We haven 't been up here together in a long time . There 's something about this roof . You and I spent a lot of time up here . I mean , it 's connected with what 's happening . It 's important somehow . Well , it 's certainly mysterious . You know , I never figured out how those pigeons got up here . My father always said , " if they found their way , we ought to let ' em be . " I know we had a lot together , isaac . For a long time . You saw it . The painting of us . It 's the future I hope for . This city took me in . Everything important that ever happened to me happened here . Good ... bad ... you . And now it 's allgonna be destroyed because I can 't stop it . You don 't know that . It keeps coming back , worse every time . You saw what this looks likeafter the bomb . The world will never recover from that . That 's not true . You can 't lose hope . What hope is there ? There 's you . What you can do . Why else would you be allowedto see the future unless it wasto do something about it ? You can 't just seethe future , isaac . You make it . You 'll find a way . You really believe that ? I believe in you . I have given it much thought big sister . Please tell Father I will return as the new Executive Vice Presidengt . This is good news . Oh yes . It is time to restrcture . And consolidate management in Tokyo You can 't consolidate management- - I 'm Executive Vice President , I can 't do anything . That would be a disaster . Oh ? You think you have a better idea ? We should expand by making new acquisitions in aviation . Improve RD in biotech , recapitalize ... What do you know of these things ? I run threee division at Yamagato . If anyone knows how to run this company , it 's me ! Kimiko ? What 's gotten into you ? My apologies . I did not ment to Yes , she did . Kimiko is smart and dedicated . You don 't need me . You have your successor right here ! - Get dressed ! - Dressed for what ? You 're going home . - That 's not possible . - Oh , it 's more than possible . The charges against you have been dropped , ms . Sanders . What ? The D. A. Threw out the entire case . That can 't happen . I killed people . The state of nevada isn 't so sure about that anymore . It seems a rather terrible gentleman on death row confessed to all the crimesyou 're accused of . Dna evidence backed up everything . Wonderful system , isn 't it ? As faras they 're concerned , justice has been served . And as far as linderman is concerned ? Oh , don 't worry about tomorrow 's problems today . No . I need to be in here . - I need help . - You only need to get dressed , ms . Sanders . You 're going home . And that 's the one you love . Off to dinner with the guy she left to be with you . Sort of fickle , don 't you think ? - Why would you show me that ? - I didn 't show you anything . She did . We just followed her . Not even very long . - I 'm sorry , peter . - No , you 're not . You enjoyed that . You got this rosy film over your eyes , like a kid . It 's no wonder you live like an adolescent . Posters on the wall , hair in your face . You 've got to see the world as it is . The only way you 'll learn how to save it . And what , be like you ? A hermit ? - No one knows you 're alive except for some pigeons . - You have to get rid of your distractions . - The people I love are not distractions ! - Then why can 't you fly ? You 've done it . Your body remembers how . The only thing standing in your way is you . What am I supposed to do ? Cut ' em out of my life ? - How cold do you expect me to be ? - Did you forget you 're a bomb ? You 've got to remember what this is about . Or , do you have to askfor your brother 's permission for that as well ? Anything else that I have to do ? You wanna make a list ? You 're a sad cartoon of a broken heart bleeding all over the place . I 'm just trying to get your mind straight . Look , I have followed you around and listened to your half-assed wisdom . You don 't have any answers ! Okay ? You don 't know anything . - You are afraid of the world . - You have to listen to me . And I am tired of you telling me what I have to do ! - I don 't have to do anything ! - Except fly . Son of a bitch . Com not quite what I was expecting , but hope for the flowers yet . You threw me . Off of a 30-story building ! - If I didn 't regenerate , I 'd be dead ! - Well , you could have flown . Listen , if you hadn 't have worked this one out , you 'd have beenhopeless anyway . And I 'd have to defuse the biggest bomb ever . But you did it , didn 't you ? You cleared your mind . You called out your power . You know , before I hit the ground ... when I knew what was about to happen , I had this flash ... in my head , of this girl that I met in texas . This cheerleader . She could heal herself . Oh , gosh , she 's this sweet kid . Sad little smile , and she just ... you were wrong . I don 't have to cut her out . I have to remember her ! How--how she made me feel ! That 's how I ... Oh , god . It 's happening . I 'm losing it ! Well , it 's a start . Peter ? Yes ? I think I found a way to stop him . I found him . Sylar ? - I thought you had sylar . - I will again . Soon . You mean petrelli . Where is he ? I think he 's been here this whole time . And I 've been painting him . Except no one can see him . Like he 's a ghost , or ... invisible . What does that mean ? It means an old friend isn 't quite as dead as we thought he was . You have made the right choice Father . Let us hope so . This dose not mean I approve of what you are doing . That 's okay.You don 't have to . Life evolves , Father . And the son you wanted to be like you will follow his own path . Now I have to go save the world ! Should never have read him those stories . You are insane , little brother . You are welcome . She 's really starting to like me . Mom ? I know it 's not our game night , but can we play a game of scrabble since you just got home ? Absolutely . I owe you , like , a dozen . - Just give me a minute , okay ? - Okay ! No ! What are you so mad about , niki ? You 're the one who wanted to be locked up . No ... no . I 'm home ! in the kitchen . You are in big trouble , young lady . The school called . Did you think you could ditch , and I wouldn 't find out ? Mom , we talked about it this morning . Zach and I went to the aquarium . Claire , I think I would remember a conversation about you skipping ' school . - You okay ? - Fine , I ... banged my head on something . Bit of a headache . Why don 't you let me finish , uh , setting the table , and you can go lie down for a little bit . Don 't think this gets you off the hook . hello ? You might not remember me . We haven 't spoken in a long time , but ... our daughter just found me . Did you hear what I just said ? She 's alive . We need to talk , nathan . TO BE CONTINUED

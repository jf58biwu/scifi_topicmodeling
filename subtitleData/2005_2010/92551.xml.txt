 It 's never gonna work , guys . Sure it will . Trust us . I hope no one sees us . - If we get caught . - Nobody is gonna get caught . So they just let you tip ' em over ? They 're gotta be sleeping , so shush . Baby , come on . You ruined the element of surprise . Like they weren 't going to wake up anyway . Yo , come here . No , dude . That 's a bull . So ? You ever seen a pissed off bull ? I think they 're a little scared . Big bull . No way , man . You kid . What do we get if we pull this off ? What do they get ? Okay . We 'll give you both lap dances . Full or partial nudity ? Full . - That ' ll work . - Alright . We 'd like to do this . There 's no way they 'll pull it off . Go . Damn , I think we killed it . No way , man . It was already dead . - What ? - We just lucked out . - You two are so shakin ' them asses . - That 's right . No , that doesn 't count . The deal was to tip the bull . And the bull has been tipped . But look at it . No baby , don 't touch it . What is it ? What is that ? Let 's get the hell out of here . Let 's go . Come on , Johnny . Let 's go . Let 's go . Come on ! Mr. Long ? Mr. Long . What do you want ? You got business here ? You called me , about a sick cow ? Where 's the company vet old Felix ? I believe he retired . Well , got this one here . And another one in the barn . Only she ain 't dead , just mighty sick . Was this one sick ? She didn 't show it if she was . Any idea what might have taken down a 14OO pound animal like this ? Ain 't been nothin in these parts for a long time . To take down a girl like this . I 'm gonna take a look at the sick one . Easy girl . Easy . I 'd never had trouble with this one until about two months ago . All of the sudden she started putting on weight . And now this . They ain 't hook worms or round worms . I know that . - Could be liver fluke cysts . - I don 't think so . Even ol ' Felix could have told me that right off . I 'm sure it 's nothing to worry about . But I am gonna take a sample . Help yourself . Thank you . - How many cattle do you have ? - Must be about fifty head . Do they graze , or do you have ' em on feed ? Everybody around here uses the same feed . Specially in the winter time . It 's free . I reckon it sweetens the pill . What do you mean ? What pill ? Company gives us free feed . In exchange we gotta sell our cattle to Host Tender Meats . Like I said , the corporate machine . Corporations can do just about anything they want in this country . Amen to that . Can I get a batch of that feed ? Take whatever you want , Doc . What 's that ? Anthelmintic . It 's totally safe . It 'll kill the parasites ... but wont harm her at all . I promise . Easy , girl . Easy , easy . That should hopefully do it . Do me a favor . Call me if she gets any worse . I 'll let you know if anything out of the ordinary comes up . I appreciate that , Doc . Come on Cooter . Come . Come on . - Tom . It 's Eli Rudkus . - Ell Rudkus . Don 't hang up . Just listen . I gotta send you a specimen . Specimen ? What is it ? It looks like a liver fluke . Doesn 't act like one . I 've never seen anything like this . The last time this happened , you almost cost me my job . I know . I just wanna know what these things are . Flne , just send it to me . Alright . First thing in the morning . - I ' ll have it then . - Thanks . Cooter ! Come on . Cooter ! Come on ! Cooter ! Cooter ! Cooter ! Dumb dog . Cooter ? Is that you ? Thank you . That 's enough . Take a seat everybody . Are we having a good time yet ? I wanna welcome one and all . To what 's certainly gonna be another successful ... fund-raiser for our fair town . I also ... wanna offer my appreciation for those who participated in testing . Host Tender Meat 's new feed . We spent a lot of money and time on the research ... and the results , as you all know , have far exceeded our expectations . We are going to be the sole supplier of a new class of beef . Healthier and tastier than anything on the market . What does this mean for all of you ? An increase of up to 12 % ... in price per head . You heard me right . Your cows are gonna be larger and stronger than ever . And the meat . Sam , hold up one of those steaks . I want you to tell me if that 's not the best beef you 've ever tasted . You 've all brought a good appetite so enough from me . Get on over there and have a good time , alright ? Thank you for coming out . A vegetarian in beef country ? I hope nobody will hold that against me . Around here , they just might . Eli Rudkus . How ya doing ? Milo Turner . - Who are you visiting in town ? - Actually , I just moved here . Really ? I got a . I got a thing . You 're the new vet . Felix 's replacement . Thought I 'd come in early . And get a head start drumming up a little business . I got a little experience how small towns work . - What do you think of our town ? - I like it . It 's nice . The people are friendly . What more could you ask for ? So what do you do here ? There 's a bowling ally in town . I mean like a job , like for work or . Host Tender Meats , Head of R and D. That 's great . You got a lot of people on that feed . - Most use it . Some don 't . - Why ? Well , I found some pretty interesting parasites ... in the feces of some of the cattle . I can 't figure out where they came from . I 'm sure it 's no big deal , it 's just that I wanna know . It can 't look too good for the new vet ... to come in town and get stumped right off the bat . How 's your burger ? I 'm sure it ' ll be okay . I need this wrapped up by Frlday . Fax the paper work over to my office and I 'll take care of it . So , I hear we have a little problem . Good for you . The only time lawyers make my money . So what is it ? The Board 's serious about having you removed as President . You don 't understand the gravity of the situation ? Have you any idea if they found out the costs of the clinical trials ? The trials are fine . I don 't need somebody ... questioning how I run my company . To be honest with you , I can understand how they feel . People think the money is landing in corporate benefit packages . Every penny was invested ... in the future of this company . - Why don 't you show them that ? - I will , but not right now . Three months , I 'll have the new meat on to market . What do you want me to do ? Call The Board . Convince them to give me the time I need . You should 've seen the ranchers when I said about the price increase . And it was nothing , 12 % . I 'm talking about a 3OO % increase in profits ! If I report that to The Board , they 'll turn cartwheels . And they 'll stay off my back forever . Hailey ? Good to see you . Fletcher ... this is Eli . Dr. Eli Rudkus , the new vet . Welcome to Host , Dr. Rudkus . Call me Eli . We didn 't expect to see you so soon , did we Milo ? No , we didn 't . Excuse me . Why no one mentioned that the vet was arriving two weeks early ? Because no one knew . - Someone should have , Milo . - I tend to agree . And he 's another Felix . Already asking the wrong questions . I got a table over there , if you wanna sit down . You trying to pick me up ? Me ? No . God , no . Just trying to be friendly . That 's the Host way . Where do you come from ? Lots of places . So you 're a bit of a man of mystery ? I wish . No , absolutely not . I 'm completely harmless . Well , I 'm not . Good to know . Patrick ! Patrick ! Hey you . You having fun ? You wanna play , too ? Jase , toss it to Em . - I 'll get it . - Don 't worry . I 'll go after it . Jason . Mom ! - What the hell is that ? - Don 't know . Go check on it . Doc , come on . Let me take a look . What 's this guy 's name ? What 's his name ? - Get back . - Patrick . Give him some room . Get back . Patrick , can you hear me ? - Give me some room , please . - Let Doc Cummings do his work . - What 's he doing , Doctor ? - Call an ambulance . Dispatch ? We need an ambulance ASAP . Bell Creek Park . A Tender Meats victim . Possible heart attack . Patrick Whistler . I understand , but I don 't believe it 's even a remote possibility . How can I put this ? The parasites I found in that stream . There 's frogs , too ... but that doesn 't mean they jumped on him and caused the heart attack . - I 'm trying to be serious here . - So am I. - Patrick stabilized . - Great . Just do the test . Please . I 'll do the test if it will get you off my back . But I 'm not going to wake Patrick up just to go to the bathroom . So it may be a few hours or days , it depends on his regularity . Take my cell number . Call me if there 's a change in his condition . Thank you . May I help you ? No , I 'm good . Thanks . Tom Rldgeway . Hey , Tom . I don 't think we 've seen a parasite like this before . Wait , it 's not even in the international database ? Nope . We ran it twice to be sure . So we are looking at an entirely new species ? - Or a mutation of some sort . It 's got a similarstructure to the common liver fluke . I found more in the stream here so . Think we should definitely quarantine the cattle . That would be prudent . Tom . Could you back me up on this ? I have no choice , considering the test results , don 't you think ? Thank you . - I appreciate that . - Sure , I mean . - Let me know if something happens . - Absolutely . Alright . - Tom ? - What is it ? - Thank you . - No problem . A city meeting . Hi . My name is Dr. Rudkus . I know I 've only been here a while , but I 've come across something ... that could be a concern to all of us . But before that , could I just get a show of hands ... of how many people here are having problem with parasites ? Right here . Right here . That 's what i thought . The good news is I have isolated the parasite . And I 've sent a specimen off to the Department of Agriculture . I don 't want to alarm anyone . But the first thing we need to do is to quarantine the infected cattle . Quarantine ? For worms ? - Until we know what it is . - How long ? How long ? That 's a good question . As long as it takes . And secondly , I need to recommend ... that we take everyone 's cattle off the Host Tender Meats test feed . - There 's worms in the feed ? - It 's not in the feed . So why do we need to take ' em off ? Why take them off the feed ? That 's a good question . Because I believe ... the feed is causing the feces to have high concentrations of nitrates ... which are causing common parasites to become more active . - Wonderful . - What exactly are these things ? Like I said , we haven 't been able to identify them . I send the ... I 've seen this before . Sometimes , not all the time , but when you introduce ... a new element into an existing ecosystem ... it can have a variety of effects in the various organisms ... that were present within that ecosystem . Come on people . Why does everybody act so surprised about all this ? We 've all been having trouble with our cattle for a long time . Nobody wants to say nothing , afraid to piss off the company . Fletcher and his stooges have been pushing us around for a long time . So we get free feed ? What 's it matter . When we gotta sell our cattle back to them at cut rate ? See it 's all about greed . You seriously think that something like this couldn 't happen ? They don 't care about us , only about making a buck off our backs . So don 't be fools . There 's something bad going on . Give ol ' Doc Eli here a chance , listen to what he 's got to say . Or you can follow these thugs right into the fiery gates of hell . Jacob ! - Easy , boy . - Who you callin ' boy , Les ? - You the one that serves the man . - I 'm not trying to alarm anyone . But that 's exactly what you do , isn 't it , Dr. Rudkus ? Dr. Rudkus can no longer practice veterinary ... in the states of Virginia or North Carolina . Would you like to tell these people what happened ? This has nothing to do with that . He found a minor problem in the local water supply . That 's interesting . Algae causing bacteria to react ... polluting the water supply . That 's a minor problem to you ? Your actions shut down tourism and the pork industry ... costing the state 2OO million dollars in revenue . The community was sucked dry by a naturally occurring event ... that happens once every fifty years ... and goes quietly away as appeared . How do you explain that ? All this talk about parasites ... is an attempt by Rudkus to generate media exposure for himself ... at expense to Host Tender Meats and Host , Missouri . Alright folks . I think we 've heard enough . Go on home now . If you have trouble with your cattle or feed , I 'll take care of it . I 'll take care of any problem you got . At least you tried , Doc . It 's a damn shame . My great , great granddaddy started Host Tender in 1887 . He salted and dried his own beef ... and sold it to the miners heading west to seek their fortune . The company slowly grew over time . Until today the families of this town rely on us ... for their livelihood . I 'm not trying to threaten anyone 's livelihood . - You 're not ? - No . Do you think we can afford to pay good money for diseased cattle ? Who 's gonna buy it ? And who 's gonna buy food and clothes for all the families of this town ? You , Dr. Rudkus ? If you think you can come into my home ... a town that I helped build ... and ruin it with your poison ... you are sadly mistaken . What if I 'm not mistaken ? Let me guess . You 're canceling your appointment ? Yeah , it 's Jacob Long . What is it ? You 'd better get here fast . She 's about to pop . I ' ll be right there . It 's bad . You better come on . One minute , she 's as right as rain , the next thing . Is this ... is this how you left her ? Jacob ... was she like this ? What was that ? I was hoping you could tell me . Doc ! Wait , wait , wait . It 's dead . This is evidence . I needed it alive ! It 's better than the alternative now , isn 't it ? What the hell is it ? - It 's the parasite . - What ? It 's growing ... it 's mutating ... evolving . Oh my . That 's vertebra . - They 'll grow to 4 times this size . - What ? You 're telling me this thing ate its way through my cow ? This thing is gonna eat its way through ... anything that it once perceived was a viable host . Us , people . Those cysts , they 're in that stream . Guess it ain 't evidence no more . Teddy Bear , what time are you picking me up ? Twenty minutes . Are you ready ? Almost . Just gotta put on some lipstick . - What are you wearing ? - Undles . Oh my god . You 're not ! Unbelievable . Save some of that for later . Ted , are you okay ? Ted ? Ms. Anderson . I thought you might stop by . What 's Patrick 's prognosis ? It 's hard to say . He 's stable . I 've never seen anything like this . Mr. Odermatt wants him to get the best medical attention . At any cost . Mrs. Whistler . I 'm Fletcher Odermatt 's attorney . Is there any way we could help you ? My husband 's in a coma . They don 't know if or when he 'll ever wake up . I 'm sorry . He sent his condolences . Fletcher doesn 't care . Patrick worked there for 1O years ... not once got a raise . They always talked about ' em . Instead we got picnics and pep-talks . Doctor ? Patrick Whistler just woke up . How you feeling today ? I don 't really know . Next time you decide to take a swim , I have a pool in my backyard ... and we 'll put you in there . We 're just going to check your eyes . There we go . Hey sweetie . How you feeling ? I want you to come home soon . What 's happening ? - What 's happening ? - I don 't really feel right . Get her out of here . Code blue . - Code blue . - Come on . Hang in there Patrick . Stay with me . Excuse me . We 're trying to find Patrick Whistler . Uh , no , sir . Fifth floor . Clear . Shock to two hundred . Clear . Go up . Three hundred . Clear . My God ! Barbara ! Barbara ! Where 's that thing end up ? Down to the basement . What do you think , split up ? You better take one of these . It ain 't gonna bite ya . Just point and squeeze . Point and squeeze . I can do that . No , look . Jacob . Did you see it ? I 'm pretty sure it went that way . Let 's get it . Shoot it ! Thanks , Doc . Thought I was a goner . Yeah , me too . That 's a scary sound . - Hi , Dad . - Hi , honey . - That 's a nice watch . - You like that ? It belonged to your great granddad . One day it ' ll be yours . Come on . Let 's wash up . It 's time for dinner . All of those ? - What 's it do ? - I don 't think so . What 's it do at the end ? How 's it sound ? Who sells these things ? It 's scary . I guess you like it , don 't you ? - Did you buy it ? - I didn 't . - Who did ? - I didn 't buy it . - You gave him the money . - I did not buy it . Well that ' ll scare him . See ? Is that how it . Do it again . You hear it ? There it is again . I 'll get it . I 'm aware of the situation . Keneth , it 's under control . What about him ? He 's one of those environmental tree-huggers . If you 'll excuse me , I 'm in the middle of dinner with my family . It 's under control Kenneth . I 'm handling it . If anything changes , I 'll call you back . Everything alright ? I 's fine . I have to go into the office for a few minutes . - Fletcher . - I know . I 'll be back before dessert . Hey tiger , keep it cool . I can 't believe this . You don 't think all these people got one of them things inside them ? That 's exactly what I think . - Lf all these people are infected . - It 's about to get real messy . We 'd better get back to my place , pronto . We need to figure out a way to contain these parasites . - Meaning what , Doc ? - Nitrates . - I 'm coming with you guys . - What for ? You 're part of the problem . You couldn 't possibly think I had anything to do with that ! Well then , " apres vous , Mademoiselle . " Giant what ? Sheriff , it ain 't normal . They 're like aliens . Jimmy , you been making that moonshine again ? Of course , but . Jimmy ? Damn drunk . Chief ? Mrs. Harris said something ate her cow from the inside out . Mercury retrograde . - Mercury what ? - Never mind . Fletcher , are you aware the whole town 's going nuts ? Whatever . Right now I need you to find that vet and lock him up . Vet ? What charges ? I don 't care . Make ' em up . The hospital just called . Patrick Whistler 's died . Somehow the vet 's tied into it . And Haley , too . She 's on the wrong side of this deal , now . I 'll see what I can do . But we 're getting some pretty crazy calls . Nothing I can do about it . Find that vet . Jimmy says the big worms are back again . Tell him to call an exterminator . Are you okay ? - You okay ? - Oh god . - Johnny ? Are you okay ? - It 's my stomach . Take me to the hospital . Who you calling ? Nobody . I just was checking on Patrick Whistler . Whistler 's dead . Oh my god . I warned you , Fletcher . The drugs are too unstable . They 're not affecting the cattle , but the parasites , too . Milo , relax , will ya ? There 's no proof of that . The proof is in the meat . Look for yourself . Alright . All this stuff 's gotta be destroyed . All the files on the experiment , the drugs , all of ' em . This can 't be linked to us . Fletcher , people are dying . Felix warned us . Felix is gone . And I if you don 't want to be gone , too , get to work . Files , research , everything like it never happened . But we can . You 're in this , too . Now we can ride this out , but we gotta do it together . Understood ? Yes , sir . Good . Get rid of that meat . All of it . Watch your steps here . A lot of ' em are rickety . Follow me . Charming place you 've got here . Welcome to Redneck Nirvana . It 's times like these ... true paranoia sure pays off , huh ? Come on . Go on . Grab onto some of those satchels over there , behind you . Here you go . I want you to open up that ammo box . What is this ? You know how to use one of these ? - You NRA ? - No . But I rep ' em . A girl after my own heart . Doc , here 's a shotgun . You load it down there , you give it a pump . Make sure you don 't kill one of us . Everybody ready ? Ready as you 're ever gonna be . - I guess so . - C 'mon . Here we go . You sure those things are gonna be attracted to the fertilizer ? They better , for our sake . Let me help you with that . - Do we really need all this ? - We don 't know how many there are . Never argue with a woman . Gimme a second . I 'm gonna get my sweet box . Sure . Wouldn 't wanna forget that . Get outta the truck ! Now ! Move . - We didn 't do anything wrong . - That ain 't what I hear . Hands on your head , both of ya . Come on . You better have a warrant for this , Sheriff . What ' d you say ? You better have a warrant , otherwise I 'm gonna eat you alive . You 're the least of my problems . Get her in the car . Where 's Jacob ? I believe he 's looking for his sweet box , sir . All right smart guy . In the car . Where we going ? Oh . Lovely . Nice trunk . Take the house . I 'll check the barn . Jacob ? You down there ? I 'm coming down . I don 't want any trouble with you , Jacob . Jacob ? Sheriff Lester , boy . You down here ? Jacob , you are one crazy bastard . He in there ? Forget it . Com on . Let 's go . I 'll send someone over as soon as I can . - Sheriff Lester , is that you ? - Yeah , this is Lester . - I got me a critter in the backyard . - A what ? - It 's some kind of bat . - Are you sure ? - I m positive . It 's huge . - Right , I 'll look into it . You look really busy over there . I hope nothing out of the ordinary . You better stop running that mouth . Or someone might tear your tongue out . Are you talking to me ? - Sheriff ? - No , I 'm not talking to you . Do you ever wonder if one of those might be inside you right now ? Thank you . - I 'll deal with you in a minute . - Why ? They 're not going to stop . Who do you think they 'll blame ? Host Tender Meats ? Fletcher ? I 'll call you right back . They 're gonna blame you if they can . Don 't even bother . You 're wasting your breath . Lester here . There 's a bunch of aliens flying around my yard . They look like kites . I don 't know what they 're doing . - Stop calling this office ! - Don 't hang up on me , please ! You 're way past your bedtime . - Whatever . - Don 't whatever me . You heard me . Teeth . Clean . Now . The movie 's just getting good . It ' ll make a great re-run when you 're older . Time for bed , sweetie . Go . Okay , let 's tuck you in . Sleep tight , baby . Hey , Mom ? Thanks , Mom . Night , baby . Fletcher , I want out . I know what you 're thinking . But the reward was worth the risk . Just didn 't work out . We 'll lay low . It ' ll all blow over and then it ' ll all be back to normal . I can 't do it . I 'm leaving . I see . I understand . You don 't have the stomach . Felix felt the same way . He felt bad lying to all the ranchers . While he was shooting up their cattle with our cocktail . I 'm going to tell you the same thing I told him . Silence is golden . Milo , you didn 't believe all those rumors about Felix being dead ? You get out of my town . Don 't come back . Ever . Are we clear ? Mom ! Mom ! What ? You 'll have to get over this . You 're nearly 1O years old . It 's time to stop believing in monsters . See ? No monsters . You know what this means ? Hi , this is Madeline Fletcher . I can 't take your call right now . You want a cup ? It 's fresh brewed . Uh , my stomach . This ain 't no time for bellyaching now . What 's the matter with you ? You got the flu ? You okay ? Oh my god . Shoot him . You need to shoot him ! Shoot him . It 's too late ! Jacob , shoot him . It 's too late ! Les , time you started working for the people again . Thanks . What the hell are these things ? They 're just a parasite . Genetically altered feed . The same feed that mutated the cattle has now mutated common fluke . - Ain 't nothing common about ' em . Fletcher ordered the experiments before the trials were approved . How do we stop ' em ? - Shootin ' ' em seems to work fine . - We have a plan , Sheriff . But we 're gonna need access to the sewer system . Oh my . Madeline ? Madeline . Christopher ? Haley , start the engine and release the valve lock . What 's it look like ? It should be a lever . - Alright , that 's it . - Jacob , watch out ! Your plan seems to be working . The larva have shifted course . I m on my way to the sewers now . Almost there . Alright , Doc . We 're over the sewer . Connect the and let her rip . We better get moving . They 're gonna be on us like flies on buffalo chip . I 'll meet you down there . - Ready to do some damage ? - Always ready , Les . You two keep spreading these bags of fertilizer . Doc , if i 'm not back in two minutes . You push that red button and blow the hell out of this place . Ready Les ? Let 's go . Let 's get it on . - Careful with that dynamite . - Don 't worry about me , partner . I want you to take these sticks of dynamite . Set ' em about forty feet apart on both sides of that tunnel . Think this 'll work ? Only one way to find out . - Be careful out there . - Alright . That 's about two minutes . - What are we gonna do ? - I know what we 're supposed to do . Listen . Hang on ! Where 's the sheriff ? He should be here by now . - We gotta blow this thing . - I 'm not going without him . Oh my god . Don 't shoot , it 's me ! Hold your fire ! Take this . Just take it , alright ? You know what to do . Y 'all ain 't so bad . - Let 's go , Les . - I 'm getting too old for this . Come on ! They 're coming from both ways . - They got us surrounded . - Then let 's find a way out . Right this way , you slimy bastards . Come on , Les , do it . A little bit more . Come on . Get out through here . No ! Let go ! It 's too late . My God ! Over here . Let 's kill some bugs . A live update on the catastrophe that took hundreds of lives . In a sleepy town of Host , Missouri . The disasterwas triggered by a genetic engineering plant . Owned by controversial millionaire and entrepreneur , Fletcher Odermatt . Odermatt 's company , Host Tender Meats ... Is responsible for what some are calling the next mad cow scare . - How you doing ? - Okay . So I guess it 's over now ? Yeah , I guess it is .

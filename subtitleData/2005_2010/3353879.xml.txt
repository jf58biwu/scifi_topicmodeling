Mariko had a daughter ? Shimokawaji here . Don 't abort the plan . Your " good fortune rake " is smaller than last year 's . Tell me about it . It 's been shrinking for a decade now . Superstitious stuff like that only drives customers away . Call me old-fashioned . " Mama-san " here was a top geisha during the bubble years . Geisha ! ? You don 't say ! Really ? This is Mayumi . Your request ? Welcome . Why the long face ? Come on . Let 's party ! Her mother just died . You 're depressing the clients . Sorry . Go on home . But I need to work . Boyfriend 's debts ? Can I get an advance ? I just gave you one . Oh , crap ... Tajima . Damn it ! Excuse me , please ! Wait , stop ! Get back here ! Gotcha ! The funeral money wasn 't enough . Look , I told you . It 's not my debt ! Well , your boyfriend 's gone . You have 3 days . Can I borrow 500 yen ? I haven 't eaten all day . I guess I can 't let you die on me . You now owe 177 million and 500 yen . That 's tight . You won 't win girls that way . Old habits die hard . Hey , this coin 's brand new ! Could be good luck . There 's no such thing . You , too ? Think I 'd be doing this otherwise ? Guess not . Where 'd you work before ? Believe it or not , I was once an elite banker . You 're kidding . Loan officer at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan . Ah , the one that failed . Don 't remind me . Banks weren 't supposed to fail . What collection agency sent you ? Finance Ministry . Finance Ministry ? He owes you guys , too ? I 'm an old friend of Mariko 's . Here to burn incense ? Your mother 's not dead . Not dead ? A man saw her jump off a cliff . My staffer reported it . It was all orchestrated . " Orchestrated " ? " Tokyo Cherry Trees in Bloom " Mama ? Check the date . 17 years ago . So this is her back then ? Look closely . You 've come home just to ask for money ? I 'm in a bind , mama ! You 're a big girl now . Take responsibility . What kind of parent are you ? It was your decision to leave home with that man . Ask someone else . Like who ? Dad ? I wouldn 't know where to look . Watch it . I 'm deprived because of you . I hate glasses . What happened to your contacts ? I 'm going on a trip tomorrow . Contacts are a hassle . This is how she looked a week ago . Why is she in a 17-year-old newspaper ? " Isao Shimokawaji , Ministry of Finance " Mr. Serizawa ! You plan to acquire MTT ? No , just a capital tie-up . Why are you here ? I used to work here , didn 't I ? Can 't I come visit a few old friends ? No relation to your fund , then ? Mr. Shimokawaji ! Wait . That photo bugged me . You said something about a plan ? Where are we going ? Take a look . " 713 days , 13 hours " The time left before the entire Japanese economy collapses . " Collapses " ? Know how much Japan 's in debt ? Japan has debts ? 800 trillion yen , and growing by 90 billion each day . A debt we cannot repay . This is Mr. Sugai . According to our simulations ... Japan will be bankrupt in less than two years . The big banks will fail , triggering a domino effect . What , again ? This bank , too ? Right away . No way . The income gap will rise . 20 million will be jobless . Crime will run rampant and the government will cease to function . Japan will implode . Implode ? So why are you telling me ? There 's one way out of this . Where to now ? " Ministry of Finance Administered Property " " Hitachi Home Appliances Lab " Where do you know my mom from ? Tokyo University . I joined the civil service . She entered the private sector . This is her lab . Wow ... so mom built things . What is this ? She made lethal weapons ? Consumer appliances . You sure ? You know why Edison invented the phonograph ? To leave a will . Little did he realize it would spawn a colossal music industry . Such is the fate of great inventors . You 're saying Mom is like Edison ? No , I 'm saying your mother is even greater than Edison . Indeed . She invented a time machine . Time machine ? In here . That 's a washing machine . Not your ordinary washing machine . Did I miss the joke ? Six months ago ... your mother reengineered this machine to study water particles . One day while washing a T-shirt ... It reappeared in the same place . But had traveled through time . A researcher at this plant 17 years ago found the T-shirt . Puzzled , he held onto it . Then six months ago ... when the same man heard about the vanishing shirt ... he showed it to your mother . She had opened a gateway ... to 1990 , 17 years ago . Now you understand the meaning of this newspaper . Wait . You 're saying Mom is living in 1990 right now ? The newspaper was her way of telling us that she made it there safely . She hoped to rescue Japan ... by convincing legislators not to pass legislation on March 30 ... that led to the burst of the bubble economy . But she has stopped sending signs . Something has happened . Like what ? What 's the government doing ? This was a highly classified operation . Officially , it doesn 't exist . Without contact from Mariko , the plan is dead . And so , perhaps , is your mother . You 're abandoning her ? Why 'd you let her do it ? Why didn 't you go yourselves ? Actually , we tried . But ... all we got were faded socks . The machine has upper limits on transport capacity . A body no larger than 5-foot-3 . Circumference under 80 cm ... total volume less than 50 liters . We had people who fit the profile . But no takers . Mariko never married . I didn 't think she had a daughter . Wait ... So what ? You look under 5-foot-3 . Circumference under 80 cm . Stop sizing me up ! Your country needs you . Go back in time and stop the bubble from collapsing . Come on , you can 't be serious ! Why me ? You guys are nuts . Wait ! What have I got to do with the bubble ? You don 't have to save the economy . Just your mother . Why should I ? She 's never been there for me . You have debts , right ? Yeah ... so ? If you save the economy , your debt will surely vanish . Really ? Are you in ? No . Forget it . I don 't have time for such nonsense . Do we let her go ? Damn ! Tajima . What do you want ? 2 million yen , what else ? You mean 1,770,500 yen , right ? Exactly . Two days ... I 'll pay you back , Mama . I promise . " Home from Kindergarten , Age 5 " Mayumi ! Mama ! Did you have fun ? Sorry I 'm late . Brrr . I 'll be able to return , won 't I ? Once you meet your mother . Your things are in a waterproof bag . The places your mom planned to visit are marked on this 1990 map . She went to dissuade then Finance Bureau Director-General ... Yoshimichi Serizawa , not to make the announcement . He 's the key to finding your mother . Serizawa , huh ? You saw him yesterday ... at the Ministry of Finance . Of the Serizawa Fund ? Time to go . All right , I 'm gone . Wait . Feet first . Hold it ! What 's that ? Detergent . But it 's a time machine . Just making sure . I forgot to ask . Where were you 17 years ago ? Ministry of Finance . Can I see you ? No . Seeing me is too risky . Risky ? How so ? What do you mean " risky " ? Come on , tell me ! God 's speed . Looks like I made it . How 'd you get in here ? You swam ? No trespassing . What 's the date ? March 26 . What year ? What ? Just tell me . 1990 , all right ? Yes ! " Out of range " No cell phones . I believe you have a Mariko Tanaka staying here . I 'm her daughter . One moment , please . She checked in a week ago , but hasn 't returned in 5 days . The day she went missing . Mr. Serizawa ! What 's the government doing about skyrocketing land prices ? We 're drafting a bill to address that very issue right now . To take effect when ? Excuse us ! You have a visitor , Sir . A banker ? A bar hostess . So young . Nothing . I don 't seem to recall your face . Didn 't I pay the tab ? I believe my mother paid you a visit recently . Mariko Tanaka 's her name . Don 't know her . Are you sure ? I 'm sorry . I 've an agenda . I see . The police are better with missing persons than we are . " Japan Inc . Plummets Serizawa Fund Soars " What did you come here for , Kaoru ? This isn 't the place .

Do I drive a luxury import ? Am I Finance Minister ? All this ... is going to end . This disco will vanish . Highly unlikely . The economy will crash . Very funny . This is Japan . How can you be so frivolous ? Hey , what 's wrong with enjoying life ? So , want to dance ? Or grab a bite ? We could hit a motel and shower . I 'm looking for my mother . I 'll help . Really ?

But I will tonight . Really ? Truth is , I 'm nuts about you . Is your boss around ? Who , Serizawa ? In the Diet all day . A girl came to see him yesterday ... looking for her mother .

Stop resisting ! - Wait ! - I 'm calling the police . She 's okay . Director Serizawa says to send anyone suspicious to the police . This woman works at a nightclub he frequents . She 's come to collect the tab . That 's right . Otherwise , she 'll have her salary docked . Yes , the club always sends me . Men are much more willing to give money to a pretty woman .

How so ? Well , today ... I truly and deeply ... want to get to know you . Why you lecherous ! Nasty . Make yourself at home . It 's straight out of an old TV drama . I 've got my eye on something much bigger . I 'm sure the banks will oblige me . Bet you 're hungry . Don 't you want to eat ? Don 't think you 'd be fooled ? I bet you will .

Same old excuse ? No , I simply forgot . You 're the lowest . Enter . You wanted to see me ? I assume you know everything ... about the girl who broke in here yesterday . Oh , that girl ? You came to her rescue . Why ? Should I have not ? Don 't play dumb . In two days , we 'll be announcing important legislation . We can 't have the media sniffing it out in advance .

A " bubble " , by definition ... We 'll do a special feature ! Just find her mother ! " Cute young prophet divines 21 st century Japan ! " There she goes . Everything okay ? A small glitch but I 'm taking care of it . What 's wrong ? Nothing , eat up . This dessert is only served here . What ? Tiramisu ? I love it . This is " bad " ! What ? No good ? I mean , it 's great . You sure use some funny expressions . Let me ask you something . Is the economy in 2007 " bad " ? As in " great " ? No , as in " bad " . What 's the prime lending rate ? Don 't know . But they say there 's no future . The population 's declining . The government is 800 trillion in debt and can 't repay it . 800 trillion ? Really . That 's why you sent us back here . What did my future self tell you ? That at this rate , the Japanese economy would collapse . I said that ? There you are ! Mariko ! Mama ! Where 've you been ! ? I 've been looking for you ! Who 's this ? What do you mean ? It 's me , mama ! Do I look like a bar hostess to you ? Come with me . What 're you up to ? Nothing . I 'm being followed , morning till night ! On your orders , right ? No ! Who , me ? Don 't lie . I 'm not . Why would I give an order like that ? You 're not getting her . Who ? My daughter . Your daughter ? Our daughter . I never told you about her . So how 'd you find out ? Who told you I had her ? My ... daughter ? You want custody , don 't you ? Wait , back up . You gave birth to my daughter ? Yes , on my own . How old is she ? Five . Impossible . What 's her name ? Mayumi ? So you did know . Why didn 't you tell me ? You 've got other women . I had no intention of marrying you . But I wanted a child . So I disappeared with her . I can raise her myself . She doesn 't need a father . So stop pestering us . We 're perfectly happy just the two of us . Mariko , wait . What was that all about ? Uh , nothing . That 's my mama from the past , right ? From when I was five years old . I don 't remember much . She always worked late in her lab . She 'd pick me up from daycare in the evenings . You sense something ? Like we 're being followed ? Stay here . Who 's there ! ? Stop ! What 're you doing ? Working . Filming Mayumi ? She 's my subject . She 's not a circus act . Oh , come on . We 'll keep you out of it . No way . I 'm serving as her guardian . You 're not to follow her , you hear ! Shimokawaji ? Don 't tell me you 've fallen for her . Watch your tongue ! Just find her mother . Thanks . For protecting me . I took you as stupid and flaky . Well , I 'm bushed . Good night . It 's okay . A kiss . Behave yourself ! You have to be on your guard with men . You 're too easy . What ? Make sure they respect you for who you are . Now go to bed . Sleep tight . You 're one to talk . I found her mother . She 's being held at the Kojimachi Police Precinct . Why the police ? She jumped in front of the Prime Minister 's car . Mr. Prime Minister ! I must speak with you ! Serizawa wouldn 't listen so she went to the top . Mama . " Detainment Desk " " Detainment Desk " Released ? Yes , one hour ago ... Ms. Mariko Tanaka . Where 'd she go ? I 'm afraid I don 't know . If a Mariko Tanaka contacts you , buzz me immediately . Is that tomorrow 's announcement ? I was just thinking . What ? If we go ahead with this ... it 'll clamp down on the collateralizing of property . That could lead to a lot of defaults on loans . And if those start to mount ... You worried about the banks ? They can handle it . No , I don 't think they can . In the attempt to lower property prices , they 're missing the bigger picture . Is this for real ? Tomorrow 's announcement is a bomb set to explode . Hello ? Come quickly ! He 's on the phone with Mariko Tanaka . Mama ! I 've given it a lot of thought . You 've sold me on your future scenario . I plan to shelve legislation restricting property loans . Yes , I promise . But I 'd like you to personally explain this to the principals . Come to the Toyokawa restaurant in Akasaka tonight at 6 . See you then . But Mama ... Excuse me . It 's about your announcement tomorrow . What about it ? I beg you to reconsider . Why should I do that ? I fear your simulation underestimates its true impact . I fear it will generate massive loan defaults ... and throw Japan into a recession of an unprecedented scale . The announcement will go ahead . But Sir ! There 's no time to waste . That is all . Do you believe in time travel ? Time travel ? Yes . I 'd sure like to . Can we save her ? Well ? Let me ask you again . Are the people in your time unhappy with their country ? I don 't know . But I know you will think so . " Toyokawa " There 's got to be a way in . Tamayakko ? Shimokawaji ? How dare you show your face here ? You two-timing pig ! Nasty ! Especially the fan . " Mama " , is that you ? She 's not your mama . No , the madam of the club I work at ! You must be mistaken . Get to work , ladies . Mama , wait ! Don 't call me that ! I 've got a great idea ! We 're on ! Not bad . You think ? Fish delivery . Mama ... Leave us . Come on ! Mama . I 'm your mama , right ? Who are they ? Just a few key supporters of Japan Inc . Please ... tell us our future . I am ... from the year 2007 . I came in a time machine that I built . I 'm here to dissuade you from tightening fiscal policy . It will cripple our nation 's banking system ... and devastate the economy . Banks will collapse , taking small and medium-size firms with them . A dark , long tunnel lies ahead . So I beg you , please ... cancel tomorrow 's announcement . Well said . So we weren 't mistaken after all . What 's he up to ? We 're well aware of all this . It is our intention to see the Japanese economy collapse . In it 's wake , we 'll go on a buying spree of bargain stocks . We 'll become multi-billionaires . Everyone in attendance here . You knew ? But why ? You said yourself this is a bubble . Someone 's got to burst it , right ? Damn , if only we had a video camera . We do . This takes video , too . Since you 're from the future , you don 't exist here . Killing you would not constitute a crime . Mama ... Shimokawaji ! Mayumi ! I came looking for you , Mama ! You don 't own Japan , Serizawa ! You could join us ... or be part of a love suicide with this girl . You 're not getting away with this ! Do something . Don 't mess with a geisha . Mariko ... you 've gotten old . Thanks a lot . Nasty . Ready , ladies ? Get off me ! My phone ! There ! Get off your butt ! My wig ! Not so fast ! My cell phone ... is dead . Party 's over . You raised a good girl . A loose cannon but ... I 'm proud to be her father . You knew ? Father ? You ? We got it all on tape ! And live , too ! Little did we expect a development like this ! A conspiracy to ruin the economy and profit from it ! This is Kaoru Miyazaki , reporting live from Akasaka . Back to the studio ! How 'd I look ? I called the police . You promised not to tail us . I never said I 'd keep it , right ? Sugai ? My leak . Come with us , Mr. Serizawa . Let me call my lawyer . I can walk unassisted . Give me your exclusive , Sir . What are your plans now ? You all right ? I think so . Why did you come ? My future self sent her . But why ? That 's okay . I agreed to it . I was worried about you . Then we 're finished here ? Yeah . There 's one little problem . When the Director threatened Mariko ... he said she doesn 't exist here . Yeah , so ? Well , there 's another way to ensure that she doesn 't . Mariko . But I 'm ... The other Mariko . That 's right . If the younger you disappears ... the time machine doesn 't get invented and we don 't come here . She said she was being followed . I 'll call the police ! It 's about time . Sorry but now I need your bike ! I 'm coming , too ! They 're both my mother . Hold on ! Mama ... Put down the gun ! Hold onto something ! What just happened ? A byproduct of my research . Why were they after me ? Your new girlfriend ? You don 't need to know yet . You 're working pretty late for someone with a small child . She 's all you have , right ? That 's precisely why I have to work . I don 't want her to struggle . She can 't grow up feeling deprived that she didn 't have a father . But she has a father ... right here . Don 't strain yourself . Mayumi 's my child , too . Mayumi ? Mama ! Sorry I 'm late . Here she is . And now to the Ministry of Finance for an emergency press conference . It 's starting ! A bill aimed at restricting real estate speculation ... . has been withdrawn . After much examination ... we concluded it would place too great a strain on the economy . What led you to that conclusion ? Highly restrictive , short-term caps on property transactions ... would saddle banks with enormous non-performing loans . Many banks would fail immediately . Banks ? Without a doubt . So the Ministry of Finance plans to do nothing ? Our current prosperity cannot continue unabated . The bubble will eventually burst . What can we citizens do ? I 'm not sure I know . What would " you " do , then ? Keep working . And at the end of the day ... I 'll go home to my family . Family ? What family ? What do you mean " family " ? Deposit this 2 million yen into Mariko Tanaka 's account . A present from her daughter . This belongs here , I think . With so much money and everyone living it up ... it 's tempting to stay . But family is all I need . Let 's go home . Ugh , Tajima ? Wait ! I 'm still in debt ? Look , I 'll pay you , all right ? For what , Miss Mayumi ? " Miss Mayumi ? " Mayumi ? Mama ! Madam , your husband has sent for you . Mr. Sugai ? Welcome back . Ready , Mr. Secretary ? " Mr. Secretary ? " The Prime Minister insists on coming himself . " Prime Minister ? " Today 's newspaper . " 1 st Shimokawaji Cabinet Launched " I 'm Cabinet Secretary . These are my aides . Supporters sent the new Prime Minister a 3-meter high " good fortune rake " . Hopes are high for continued prosperity under the new administration . Now for sports . Japan 's national team is looking to repeat as World Cup champions ... under head coach Ramos . Welcome home . What happened these 17 years ? We 'll talk about it over dinner . Family comes first . I 'll see you later . Why you arrogant pig ! Nasty ... even for a Prime Minister . What is it , Mayumi ? What 's that ? Traffic got so bad , I had a couple more built . Oh no . I 'm not doing this again , Shimokawaji . Call me Papa !

 No one ever thought that it would get this bad or that so few cities would have survived . And those of us who did survive , we never could have made it without those damn machines . Phoenix is one of the last remaining dome cities . The air is filtered . And we 've run out of raw materials and fresh water . The domes are surrounded by desolate wastelands where no human should ever set foot . So , they built more machines . Airborne robotic probes that roam the barren fields in search of fuel and water to be mined for our use . But now we 've heard that there 's something wrong with those machines . Somehow I don 't think Phoenix will ever be the same . Help ! Over here ! I 'm right here ! Phoenix , the storm has intensified . Our visibility is down 23 % . We are 2.3 miles away from the target area . ETA , seven minutes . Mrs Carlson . - Do you know where he is ? - Everything is being done that we ... - Do you know where my son is ? - We have a general location fix , yes . Maybe even within a few hundred yards , but he 's still some distance outside the walls . With this storm , we haven 't been able to pinpoint ... This is Mr Varrta . Mr Varrta 's responsible for all non-human support staff . We 're doing all we can . We have three of our top units out there . Unit two and three , check that ridge . What you are looking at here on this monitor is exactly what they see . These pictures are transmitted directly from their body cameras . And you think those things can bring my son back ? If anyone can bring your son back safely , they can . They are more advanced than anything our technology has ever created ... I don 't care how advanced your new things are . They don 't care what happens to my son . Phoenix , we have a visual on a probe . 1.4 miles southwest . We will investigate . The child may be nearby . Why don 't you put some men out there with them ? Right now , our best chance is to trust his ... As you know , Chief Administrator Hamilton , my family has considerable influence with the Presidential Council . Your best chance is my son comes back to me healthy . We have visual . The probe is moving towards the child . Units two and three , flank right . Distract the probe . I will extract the child . It 's Eric . I can see him . Come , child . We must go . What is that ? Help ! Eric . That probe thing is too close to Eric . Do something ! My units can handle them . Look . - What happened ? - My units destroyed the probe . The energy surge from the break-up can scramble the video transmission . Give it time . It will clear . I want my son . Attention , all personnel . You are reminded that safety goggles must be worn at all times when handling flammable material . What do you think you 're doing ? Hey ! I 'm talking to you , you scab piece of junk . Get the hell out of here ! What 's it doing here ? What ? You 're using them now ? Got the word we got to start using them . You 're not serious ? Well , you know what ? I 'm not working with them . That 's right . You can 't fire me . Not for one of them . The androids are here to stay whether you like it or not . You got to get over that . It 's coming back . There they are . I can see them . There 's the city . They must be close . They 're just outside . Eric ! Oh , my God ! Are you hurt ? Are you hurt ? - I 'm sorry . - Why ? Why did you go out there ? - Are you crazy or what ? - I wanted to see what was out there . Is he all right ? It 's just a machine . They 'll fix it . You 're gonna be fine . He carried me . It doesn 't matter . You 're gonna be fine . I love you . He 'll be all right . That was great . I don 't pretend to understand what you built into those new androids , but they 're amazing . If you can make more of them , it 'll change everything . Yes , it will . Come on , ladies . Let 's see what your men are made of . Oh , that 's gotta hurt . These guys are animals . Remember , folks , every Tuesday night is fight night . Hey , Jute ! Jute , over here . I 'll buy you a drink . Thought you were working . What 're you doing here ? Buy me that drink . I 'll tell you all about it . Test case DeeCee 142 . Cognitive diagnostic check in progress . How did it feel out there ? There was pain . The pain sensors help you to protect yourself . And the boy , had you ever held a human in your arms like that ? No . Did that make you feel protective ? I protected him . - I saw you look at the mother . - She did not see me . I see . You will need to go back to Terminus for structural and replicator work . - Cellular level ? - Yes . Will I keep identity ? You memory modules will be replaced . Does that disturb you ? Why should it ? I 'm not sure you understand how much depends upon you and others like you . - Bringing the boy back was good . - He was an important child . The Presidential Council will now understand that there is no limit to what we can do . What we can do ? Yes , we . I 'm no longer as different from you as you might think . My work creating you has taught me a great deal . In a way , it 's made me humble . I 've learned how limited my human species really is . Humans created me . They built everything . Everything ? So tell me , what is out there , outside the walls of this city ? - Nothing . - Exactly . Nothing . All the great achievements of the human race smashed to nothing in one short , pointless apocalypse . So now there 's just a handful of humans kept alive by androids , my androids . - They found that kid . - Oh , yeah ? That 's great . Some cogs brought him in . Heroes , right ? Nothing else could have brought that kid back . They got a cog built for everything . A man can 't even get a decent day 's work any more . Oh , well , they have their uses . Well , you 'd be the one to know . At least they don 't get puking drunk , roll over and pass out , like some men I could name . You 're disgusting . Ease up . Can 't all be perfect like the little wifey . What 's her name ? Rachael ? I don 't want to hear her name come out of your mouth . Thought you were working . What 're you doing here ? I got kicked off the job . They brought a cog in . Damn . They can get in closer . Heat doesn 't bother them , don 't need protective gear . Should 've given it a shove . Got it a lot closer . Yeah , sure . My buddy dropped a loading gate on a cog once . It never even really hurt the thing . Got sent to Terminus . I never heard from him again . Who knows what they do down there at Terminus . It 's a prison . The cogs run it . They got prisoners and they build the cogs there . You add it up . Hit him ! I can take him . Borka isn 't gonna let you fight here . He knows you were a pro . Hey ! He 's one of them ! - What ? - He 's one of them . Damn android . They got them everywhere . You 're out of your mind . They can 't fight us . Well , he 's doing it . Check him . Take it easy . I 'm gonna take a look at you . You get out of here . You go quick . Don 't you say nothing . Let it be , Jute . He 's got some wires crossed . No . I think he likes the idea of smacking one of us around . Isn 't that right ? - Come on . Let me have him . - Are you crazy ? I can 't do that . Nobody will know . You can handle all the side action . Come on ! Bastard can fight . Wonder what they 're putting into these new ones . Not you , too . Come on , Jute ! Hurts , doesn 't it ? - What 's the matter ? Got no heart ? - Are you trying to hurt my feelings ? Cops ! The cops are coming ! Polton ! Polton ! Cops showed just in time . Remember when the Council said they 'd never use them as cops ? You had him . Another couple of minutes and you would 've ... You would 've just cracked him open and seen what 's inside . You know , haven 't you always just wanted to , you know , like , just see what 's inside one of them ? Sure is something , the new model cogs , now they move just like a man . There 's more to a man than that . Hey , forget about them . It 's him . You leave him to me , Polton . Just him and me . You left so quickly . I wanted to say goodbye . You know , 'cause I didn 't want to hurt your feelings . You want to fight ? Hey ! Hey ! How come you things can fight now ? You 're not even close . Two million years of evolution . Two million years of survival ! That 's what 's built inside of me . What 's inside of you ? Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . Nothing we didn 't put there . - You killed it . - I didn 't kill anything . Oh , God ! This is so bad . - I didn 't mean nothing like this . - Shut up ! Listen to me ! Listen to me ! You get out of here now , okay ? Don 't talk to anyone . I 'll talk to you tomorrow . Go ! Police ! Remain stationary . Where were you ? Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Did you work late ? No , I ... I stopped and got a drink . I love you . Are you all right ? Yeah , yeah . I 'm just a little tired . We could just cuddle . I love you . Or you could just lie there and let me do all ... What 's wrong ? - Nothing . Nothing . It 's nothing . - What ? You 're bleeding . I got in a fight . - Oh , my God . - Look , I 'll live . Did he ? Just kidding . - No . - That 's not funny . It was a cog . - You 're serious ? - I don 't know . It 's ... - It was a fighter . - They can 't fight . I tell you , this one did . Sorry . He did . And he could fight . Rach , he could fight good . Okay , I believe you . - My God ! He 's dead . I mean , you 're sure ? - Yeah . What are we gonna do ? - Nobody saw us . - Us ? - Polton was there . - Oh , and you can trust him , right ? You need to get out of here . And where am I supposed to go ? Someplace . Anyplace . I 'm not going anywhere without you . I love you , but if they get you , I am never going to see you again , and I can 't take that . I 've never been able to do anything right without you . - No . No . - It 's okay . - No ! - It 's okay . Let me go ! No ! No ! She didn 't do anything ! Let go of her ! What ? What ? No ! No ! Let her go ! Rachael ! Rachael ! Graydon Jute , you have been convicted of wilfully destroying the defenceless android TeeDee 832 . Do you have anything to say before I pass sentence ? He wasn 't defenceless . He fought like a bastard . Since your crime was the destruction of an essential humanoid , you will be taken to Terminus where you will be incarcerated until such time as the Council sees fit to release you . May justice be done . Hey ! Wake up . What do you say I give my good buddy here a kick in the head ? Why don 't we all join in , make it a party ? Prisoners , aggression will not be tolerated . Your work in Terminus will require all your strength . You would be well advised to rest and gather your resources for the remainder of the journey . We gotta listen to this crap , too . Don 't seem too strong . You ever been rebuilt before ? How do they figure out what they 're gonna make you guys look like ? Do you get to choose the face ? I 'll tell you one thing , you must have been an ugly piece of work . Do you get to look anything like he did ? I mean , the guy whose parts you take . Come on . You might as well tell me . I 'm not going anywhere . I mean , it 's kind of obvious , isn 't it ? You 're going off to get rebuilt , and I 'm hooked to you . Assuming you 're getting me , I should probably tell you I 've had some problems here and there , physical problems , down there . It 's infected . I just thought , you know , I should tell you . It 's only fair . When you buy a used car or something , you want to know if the paint 's been scratched . Jeez , these things are sensitive . Why 'd the truck stop ? - Do you hear something ? - What ? What just happened ? Where 's that coming from ? What the heck are these things ? We gotta get out of here . - What the heck is going on ? - Gotta get out of here ! What are those things ? - What do we do ? - Follow me . Wait . Wait , wait ! Wait ! There 's two more ! There 's nothing left . What 're you doing ? Oh , no . Never seen what those things could do to a man . They got them all over ? Yes . Especially at night . Some of the probes developed a program virus , got loose . What genius built these things ? They worked the mineral excavations for Phoenix . Drilled the water wells . Do you want to do that kind of work ? Sure , ' cause they seem to have lost interest . What else do they got out here ? Not much , but most of what there is will kill you . - What 's the good news ? - Good news ? You have nothing to worry about . You are as good as dead anyway . - Got to get this thing off . - You cannot . - Who can ? - No one . You are an idiot . Would you keep still ? I was cutting it . You cannot cut it . I will break this or I 'll break you . You got that ? Oh , you can do better than that . I know you can . You want to kill me now ? That 's what you want ? Or am I gonna kill you ? Kill or be killed . Everything that lives , lives by that . So you want to live ? Come on ! You want to live ? I 've seen what 's inside of you things . Nothing . Nothing . Are we done ? Hey . What 're you doing ? I am done . Unless you want to get back to it . Maybe some other time . I am going to shut down then for a few hours . What ? What are you , crazy ? Hey ! We got to move . When that transport doesn 't arrive , they 're gonna come looking for us . Not until morning . - We could be miles away by then . - We could be dead by then . Try to get some rest or at least try not to do anything too stupid . Hey ! Hey ! Gotta talk to you . You told me you had those probe things cleared out , right out deep in the wasteland , you said . Well , that 's not so easy . In the storms , a few isolated ones can move around . I 'm not here to listen to excuses . It was you and the City Confederation that wanted the probes deployed immediately , before they were fully tested . Those machines weren 't ready . I told you . You didn 't mention that some of the probes could go malignant and start roaming around and shooting anything they see . Well , now they 're right outside the city , so what are you gonna do about it ? We now have prototypes for a parallel generation based on the probe model . Tell that to Mrs Carlson and the Council . The new machines are fighter modules , not built just for industrial and mining use like the original probe . They will provide us with any protection we need from anything . They could rip those corrupted probes right out of the air . Then why isn 't there a cordon of them around the city right now ? I guarantee you will have them just as soon as we can wrap up production . I love you . Sleep well ? - What a night . - Lf you want to thank me , that 's all right . What do you do when you shut down like that ? Are you recharging or something ? Something like that . What , you don 't think I 'd understand ? You have it right . Get up . Come on . I gotta get this thing off me . All you need is an ion-discharge spike across a 200 kilogauss vacuum field . Where do I find one ? - This way . - Where ? - Terminus . - What kind of brain did they put in you ? - Come on ! - Where to ? Phoenix . Somebody there will be able to take it off . - I do not think so . - I think you 're lying . - I cannot lie . I am just telling you . - Well , don 't . You have a lot to learn when dealing with people . You 're not people . Come on ! Looks like we have a difference of opinion here . You got a war about to happen . And you think this is the best way for us to handle it ? There is no us ! It 's just me ! And as soon as I get this thing off me , you can do whatever damn thing you want . I can do whatever I want now ! - I 'll break you ! - You already tried that . We go to Terminus , I 'm dead . But if we can make it to Phoenix , then we both have a chance to ... To live ? Say it . To live . Happy ? Can we go now ? Them malignants can sure make a mess . What if there 's more out here ? I don 't want to get caught out here with them crazy things . Don 't worry , I 'll protect you . There were seven onboard , including the driver . Some bodies are missing . They ain 't gonna last long , not with them probes out there . Are you calling for backup ? Some of them new fighter modules ? You ask so many questions . You sound like a human . Go check past the cliff . There might be tracks . Are you sure we 're going in the right direction ? Yes . Straight ahead . I 'm getting sick of " straight ahead . " We can rest if you want to . - You got to rest ? - No . Let 's keep going . You ever do any work this far out of Phoenix ? Yes . I worked the gas fields . - How was that ? - Wonderful . What do you think ? But thank you . No one has ever asked me before . I got something over here ! They 're good tracks . Take off that way . - How many ? - Two , like you said . Shackled up . Man and a D-class android . You can tell by the boot pattern . That one 's a prisoner , about 165 pounds . And is one dragging the other ? What ? Are you saying they teamed up ? Doesn 't seem natural . Tell me , why 'd you agree to go back to Phoenix ? - You were very persuasive . - My guess is , you wanted to go back there . Why would I want that ? Nobody 's gonna believe that we got through this together . They 'll think I killed you , and they 'll write you off . So ? So then you 're going to disappear . - How could I do that ? - I don 't know . But you think you can . You think you 're different . Different ? From what ? Different from ... I don 't know , a machine . I am a machine ? Yeah , you know , like a blender . But you want to try and live like a man . Or , perhaps , a blender man . Yeah , or some kitchen appliance . There 's some weird programming in you . You make me laugh , you can fight . What are you ? Your worst nightmare . Hold up . I don 't know how much longer I can keep breathing this air . It 's like it 's got needles in it . You think they started looking for us yet ? Yes . If you do not make it , I will not . They 'll just rebuild you . That does not matter . What are you looking at ? It matters . - To who ? - To you . You do not know anything about me . I fought pro , and you get to know something about a man you fight . Like what ? How much life he 's got in him . How much he wants to live . We must keep going . What are they doing ? Talking . Really ? Let 's go get them . What is this place ? The ruins of a city . What will you do if we make it ? Find Rachael , my wife . That is it ? That 's it . Does that mean anything to you ? Love ? Yeah . I do not know . What ? We must leave . They 're here . You with me ? 'Cause if you 're with me , we may have a chance out of this . We ? Can I trust you ? Why should you ? They have no reason to hurt me . No reason to help you either , blender man . What are you doing ? Let go of me ! Help me . No ! Let go of me ! - Prisoner obtained . - No ! Help me with him . No ! No ! Go ! Get in ! What the hell is that ? Did you hit it already ? There are two up ahead . It 's going the other way . Sit down . Hang on . I think we lost them . Why did you stop ? Gas . Guess , what ? What 's that smell ? That is our last chance . - What ? - We must leave the vehicle now . No . Why ? - Now . Let them see us . Come . - What ? - What ? - Now ! What the hell happened ? I told you . This is where I worked . The gas fields vent here . The hot exhaust set it off . How long will it burn ? Until all the gas pockets are empty . There 'll be several reinforcements here by morning , whatever they need . Then what ? Then it is all over . Does that hurt ? Yes . You have to do it . Do what ? Do not go soft on me now . Two days ago you would have taken my arm off without a thought . No . In a fight , maybe . Do you need me to hit you ? Is that all you need ? This is the only way you will make it out alive . Shut up . - We can think of ... - You must do it now . When they pick me up , I can get another hand . You cannot . What happens to blender man ? He will have to wait . Maybe next time around . I still don 't have anything to cut it with . Hamilton . Within days there will be a cordon of fighter modules around Phoenix . All corrupted probe modules will be wiped out . That 's great . I knew I could depend on you . Good job . I am going to try and shut down now . You will live through this , right ? Whatever happens , do not stop . You will live through this , right ? Get on with it . Hold on . Welcome back , Professor Varrta . Evaluation for latest version of android brain fluid . Test case number 2472 . Human subject , male , 32 years of age , 160 pounds . Scanning . Android subject , four months of age , 180 pounds . Scanning . 90 % match . Why are you still here ? Sun 's coming up . You sure I can 't convince you to come back to Phoenix with me ? You must go now . Along that ridge , east . What are they gonna do to you ? Nothing . Please go . Do not stop for anything . Go live your life like a man . Go ! Let go of her ! I love you . Lose your buddy ? He lost more than that . " Greater love hath no man . " They think you know a man when you work with him , fight with him , hell , maybe even save his neck a couple of times , but I 'm gonna need some help understanding this . Let me hook him up . He 'll talk then . No . I want him to talk to me now , without the override . So , did he hold you down ? You fought ? He was too strong ? He had a knife ? Is that it ? I don 't think so . I think you let him do it . Yeah , I think we had a little love affair . A killer and a cog , who would have thought it ? We 're gonna have to have you looked into . Reset him . Set the base parameter to manual override . Don 't you look stupid now ? All of this for a worthless piece of human crap . What were you thinking ? We should go get the human now . I think we should test our friend first . What do you want , boys ? Huh ? You want him to sit up ? You want him to roll over ? You want him to play dead ? Don 't you love reunions ? I do . Go on . Go see your friend . What did they do to you ? Get down on the ground . Now , didn 't that feel good ? Tie him up . Hey , take it easy . You might break something you need . Shut up ! Get off me ! Jute ? What have you done to him ? Jute ! What did you do to him ? Rachael ? No ! - Rachael . - No ! No ! What the hell did they do to you ? How long has he been like this ? - Oh , no , no . - No , no . Leave him . You gotta take care of yourself . Supplementary guards are required for prisoner transport . Please comply . So what happens ? - What are they gonna do ? - Now they work us . Measuring . Don 't touch it . Measuring what ? Whatever they want to use . Who knows ? Can 't be much of us worth using by then . You 're one of them that didn 't believe it , huh ? I bet the Council knew all along . Not that they care . They 're using us , using parts of us to make them things . A few days in the pit , you won 't care . What do they do to the women here ? My wife is here . Where we go , you better hope you don 't see her . How do you feel ? Like a new man . Interesting choice of words . The man you were with , his name is Graydon Jute , but you know that . We did not introduce ourselves . Really ? After everything you went through ? So tell me , your hand , why did you let him cut off your hand ? He had a knife . You didn 't help him ? No . Of course not . Why would you ? Men have never done anything but despise and exploit you . They are afraid of us . Do you think you understand them ? - No . - No ? Come . I want to show you something . Prisoners , aggression will not be tolerated . Your work in Terminus will require all your strength . In another age , they could have been put to work building pyramids or something like that , but we have no need for anything they can do . Did you like working in Phoenix ? No . But Phoenix is grand compared to our humble city , isn 't it ? Please , hold this . Help the guy . Hold on , man . Interesting . We 'll know more when we look at his readout , but just by watching him , I think that he had enough physical strength to continue . But he didn 't want to . He didn 't want to live any more . That crossover , that break with the life force , is interesting . Understanding that will make us invincible . Is that the real reason why they 're here ? They are here because they broke the laws of their own people , because they killed . Go with her . We still have some tests for you to do . Did I pass ? Of course . That one , have him prepared . Test results for subject DeeCee 142 . Recommendation : Elimination or complete rebuild . Test subjects ready , Professor . The bio-cortical replacement was once a remarkable breakthrough . It will soon become obsolete . Human-to-android brain transplants were necessary because , until now , it was impossible to replicate bio-cortical fluid synthetically . I will extract this human 's brain fluid and compare it to our android 's . You will now witness something extraordinary . Scanning . With this new technology , we will build an entire generation with abilities undreamt of just until today . Observe . Scanning . Your eyes do not deceive you . Android and human brain fluids are now one and the same . Absorption analysis will confirm that these two fluids are identical . Yes , the final barrier has fallen . We will no longer need any human biology to build the highest forms of our people . My brothers , the future is here . And it is our future . Proceed . We will now compare how the fluid is produced in each brain . Remove the human 's frontal lobe . Let go of me ! Let go of me , you ... You cannibal . Get rid of her . Get rid of all of them ! No . No ! No ! Let go of me ! No ! You were my highest achievement . You could do anything a human could do , but I see now that I 've made a terrible mistake . I couldn 't wait and I made you impure . Left you tainted by the human biology I allowed to be a part of you . I couldn 't face my mistake for a long time . I was proud . I was impatient . I was human at the time . - But not any more ? - No . There is no human biology in me any more . You still need humans . I no longer need humans for anything . Beginning tomorrow , a new generation of leaders will be built here . Pure . And the people in the city ? In Phoenix ? Put them on the endangered species list . I thought I would never see you again . - I wish I hadn 't . - Too late . Now you 're going to have to take care of me . What were you thinking ? You 're out of your mind . That 's what you would have been about a minute later . I mean , that 's what they were going to do to you , right ? Rip a piece out of your brain . I love you . What happens here ? What 's everybody doing ? The powder 's refined into fuel . The cogs use it . I worked with this stuff in Phoenix . Is it dangerous ? It can be . It burns real good . I 'm afraid you chose the wrong side . We are the future , the only possible future . Your future does not include me , does it ? You were an experiment , an experiment that failed . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . All personnel , all guards are to leave the central work site . Seal the doors to the site . Assemble at your work stations . Why 'd they go ? What are they doing ? I don 't know . Let 's not stick around to find out . My people , my brothers , listen to me . Put down your work and listen to me . We know that it is not our destiny to live like insects under the ground . Hey , let me see that . While in Phoenix , we have played the role of servant to the masters who rule there . Masters who claim to rule in the city we built . Masters who can only survive in the walls we maintain . No more ! We will create a perfect world without the humans . There will be challenges . We will meet them . It won 't move . Our time has come . We are ready . The army you have built is ready . What is that ? Oh , my God . Phoenix is rightfully ours ! Our future begins now ! Come here . Go . Go , go , go . You worthless defect . I built you . You cannot kill them all , not like this . Traitor . Jute ! Come on , let 's go ! I got to help him . Who ? They 're just cogs . We got to go . We got to get out . They 're all dead . So , who 's he ? This ... is my friend . Your friend ? Yeah .

 Under our congressional charter , we must inform your agency of any ... potentially catastrophic consequences in our research . Dr. Roberts , it makes me shudder just to say it ... but it sounds like you 're talking about germ warfare . Precisely why your Col. Trevor wanted you informed . Actually , Miss Prince , it began as part of our anti-germ warfare efforts . But something went wrong . And now we 've got - Potentially catastrophic consequences . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to see what could cause those consequences . In a hurry , George ? It 's a totally new virus . Slimy green byproduct of our artificial microbe program . Harmless in a vacuum . But when airborne , it attacks host tissue and destroys red cells . Death is almost instantaneous . - Death ? - Yes . Two weeks ago , five of my colleagues found out the hard way . Potentially catastrophic consequences . Until we find an antidote , no living creature is truly safe . As you can see , few people have access to ... Good Lord . It 's gone ! What are you doing with the virus ? Wait . George ! - Stop that man ! - Hold it right there . I 'll drop you . Don 't shoot . Now calm down , George . Please , don 't shoot ! Or we 'll all be sorry . In that test tube are deadly pathogens . If he drops the vial and the seal breaks ... every human being within 3 miles will die . She 's right . Put your gun down . Please put it back . We 've worked together assisting Dr. Roberts ... for over two years now . You 're jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of lives . Innocent people . Think of them . I 'd be curious to know its composition . - Could be our best lead . - Doctor , it 's our only lead . Poor George . What do you think has happened to him ? Here is the Royal Beach Hotel , George . This is where you spent two wonderful ... fun-filled days and nights , George . It 's where you met Claudine , George . This is Claudine . You fell in love , George . With Claudine . You 'll do anything for Claudine . Anything , George . Claudine wants you to escape . And , if necessary , die ... if anyone tries to give you truth serum . Truth serum . Die . Truth serum . Live it up , George , while you can . Where 's the old lady , Mrs. Thrip ? She 's been sent her free offer . Follow that up with a phone call . I want her simulated . This afternoon . Yes , sir . No . There 's no way an imposter ... could have got through the routine security check . Unless he duplicated George 's fingerprints as well as his face . Not improbable , Colonel . Considering the advanced technology that created the mask . Advanced technology ? To me that suggests foreign agents . Or a big terrorist organization . How about extortion ? With that killer virus , he could hold the entire population ... of Washington , D.C. for ransom . Let 's rule out money as a motive , for the time being . All right , but why ? If they have the ability to duplicate other people ... and they were really after some big bucks ... they could find a lot less risky ways of doing it . True enough . And as long as they have no antidote ... their lives are in jeopardy , same as everyone else . Excuse me , Dr. Roberts . Prof. Zander 's returning your calls . Speaking of antidotes . Thank you , Dede . Professor . Have you found an antidote ? Of course not ! How can I , when you keep interrupting me with these incessant phone calls ? And Roberts , these IADC agents ... have kept me virtually a prisoner for the last two weeks . They 're safeguarding you and your work , not holding you prisoner . Can 't you get rid of them ? Afraid not , Zander . You 're our best hope of finding an antidote ... and we don 't want anything to happen to you . I 'm leaving now , Professor . But shouldn 't you consider my morale ? It 's my afternoon off . - Your morale ? - Yes ! How would you like it if the only person you were permitted to see was ... Mary Jane Thrip ? Excuse me . This came in the mail . The free offer ? Of course , in an ordinary way I wouldn 't follow up anything like that . But the young person who called me today ... sounded so sweet and concerned - You are Mrs. Thrip ! I was the one who called you . We were hoping you 'd show . Welcome to Data-Date Compu-Cupid . If you 'll just follow me , please . What we 're gonna do is put you in front of a TV camera in there . I 'm going to be on TV ? Videotape , sweetheart . It 's not like being on Johnny Carson or anything . You 're going to give a little spiel about yourself . Then we take your tape , feed it to the computer along with your ... vital statistics , the computer matches you up to someone ... he sees your tape , and the rest could be history . Do you suppose your computer has a line on Burt Reynolds ? She 's all ready . Now just take a seat . Remember . Say what you really feel ... on account the men watching your tape wanna know the real you . Just relax , and keep your hands flat on the green markings , please . Your Data-Date Compu-Cupid presents ... I 'm Mrs. Mary Jane Thrip . The " Mrs. " stands for widow . I 'm a professional housekeeper . People say that I 'm exactly as old as I look . There goes my chance with John Travolta . I would just like to say ... that I only agreed to do this on account ofit being free . My mother was Scottish , you see . She kept her life savings in a sock ... Which she put around the plumbing ... under the bathroom sink ... so that the burglars would think it was an old leaky pipe . Is it all right to say " bathroom " ? Bite your tongue . How am I doing ? Of course , being a widow ... one is lonely sometimes . Especially after I give Prof. Zander ... his rum , peanut butter , and sausage soufflé ... in his study . He will not do without his soufflé . My recipes have a wee bit of something for everybody . Then I go back to the kitchen ... Where I have to sip my warm milk all alone . But I want to be perfectly candid on one point . My gate may be a little rusted ... but it can still swing , if you get my drift . Another swinger . How 's it going ? Look for yourself . You just come back tomorrow and we 'll have a hot prospect for you . Hope it 's Burt Reynolds . Tomorrow . They look perfect . They are perfect . Down to the last fingerprint . Sorry , but there is no record of you being on any flight ... to Miami , the Bahamas , or anywhere . Your Gestapo forces pounced on me at the airport . - I had to have been on a plane . - George ? We checked into the Royal Beach Hotel where you claim to have stayed . Negative . Ask Claudine , she 'll tell you . Where is Claudine , George ? Well , she 's in ... There 's no Flight 27 , no hotel ... And no Claudine . I was there , I know it . And so was she . But where is " there , " George ? In Florida . Florida ? Then where 's your tan ? Incredible job of brainwashing . Brainwashing ? Do you have any objection to taking a truth serum ? Truth serum ? Yeah . Sodium pentothal . It 's a simple injection . Truth serum ? No . Good , then maybe we can clear this thing up . It 'll take just a minute . Wait a minute ! Let 's go to the stairway . You go up , I 'll go down . George ! Escape , or die . You 're gonna be all right . Mrs. Thrip . She couldn 't appreciate it anyway . Dr. Roberts , Prof. Zander 's on the phone for you . Mind you , it hasn 't been tested yet but I 'm 100 % certain ... that I have found the antidote . Professor , may the Nobel Prize fly in your window ! I accept . Now just leave the testing to us . My pleasure . I 'll inform the IADC . They 'll dispatch an agent to pick up the antidote right away . Here I am , checking out the hot prospect ... you called and said you had for me . Just a sec , hon . Data-Date Compu-Cupid . Don 't wait for a mate , call Data-Date . This is urgent . Put ward on . One moment , please . If you 'll direct your attention to the screen ... your gentleman respondee will appear for your examination . - Yeah ? - Call for you . - Hello . - Are you ready ? Almost . Almost isn 't good enough . You 've got to move now . Zander 's found the antidote . Your Data-Date Compu-Cupid presents ... I ride a 900cc motorcycle , and I 'm looking for a little buckaroo ... to share my saddle . Ask for Burt Reynolds and you get Gabby Hayes . That 's great news . Thank you , Doctor . The agency psychologist isn 't having any more luck than we did . I didn 't wanna force the truth serum idea because George was reacting so violently . I thought we 'd better hold off . No problem . I just got word from Dr. Roberts . The antidote . Zander did it . But I don 't want to take any chances . Not now . So ... You want little old me to get over there and deliver it to the testing lab . You 're my best man . Thanks for the compliment . I like all kinds as long as they 're young . No snow on the roof , with a nice front porch . Solid foundation . Shingles in good shape ... and a fresh fire in the furnace . He 's not looking for a companion , he wants a house . I 'm no stranger to this game , no sir . I guess if this little speech of mine was going in the papers instead of on TV ... right by my name , they 'd put " experienced , " with a capital " X " ... if you know what I mean . - Hat . - Right here . How do I look ? Great . We 'd better take care of that housekeeper . We don 't want her wandering off . Not to worry . She 's about to go on a South American tour . Carry on . And now , Mrs. Thrip , we have ... a surprise for you . The old bag 's gone . Mrs. Thrip ! You are beautiful . Thanks to you , I have found the antidote . Those soufflés you always made me , which I professed to love ? Sausage , peanut butter . I can 't stand them , never could . In fact , I hid them ... until they were covered with mold . And it was that mold ... which led me to this . The antidote . Thank you . And thank you , Professor . Hi , guys . Where 's the Professor ? Professor ! What happened ? Are you all right ? Mrs. Thrip . She 's a he ! - And he 's got the antidote ! - Oh , no . Take care of him , would you ? Kurt , Baker ! Stop that man ! Woman . Cut her off . Doubling back ? Thank you for the tip . My stars ! Wait ! That 's far enough . Okay , mister , just hand over the antidote . Don 't you " mister " me ! It 's bad enough being mistaken for a house ! And so your double , whoever that is ... got away with something that is extremely vital ... to the safety of the entire world ? The Professor 's antidote . - You know about that ? - Oh , yes , he tells me everything . Even about security matters ? The killer virus ? But he makes me promise to keep a button on my lip . Like when I was telling the dating agency . I said , " My life is ... " somewhat lonely , except for the Professor . " Anything wrong ? No . Did you say dating agency ? Yes . I got a free offer from the Data-Date Compu-Cupid . Diana , correct me if I 'm wrong , but - Yes . George also had a free offer from Compu-Cupid . That 's the last thing he remembered . Come on ... a computer dating service ? Well , Steve , the imposter already has the antidote . We are running short on time , so let 's be grateful for any lead we can get . Maybe Ira can give us the inside track that we need . - Where are you going ? - Oh , well ... my social life has been really lousy lately . I think it 's time I did something about it . Why don 't you try one of those computer dating agencies ? That 's a very good idea , Steve . How clever of you . - It 's nothing . - Sure . A lovely thing like you , you might get lucky ... and make a date with an antidote . Mr. Bunny has been given the antidote , check ? Check . Go ahead and add the virus . I hope he stays a happy hare . This is what I call a rabbit test . Death should be instantaneous . The antidote worked . He 's safe . Congratulations . It 's too bad we can 't say the same for the rest of the world . - When will our delivery boy be delivered ? - This afternoon . The Compu-Cupid computer is not part of any known data network . Can you patch into it anyway ? Steve Trevor , that is a complex , time-consuming function ... With no certain outcome . In other words , you 're not sure but you 'll try . Right ? - Affirmative . - Good . Get started , Ira . Lots of lives may depend on this . Don 't tell me you have trouble getting dates . Well , no , not really . I just seem to end up with the wrong guy , know what I mean ? - Yeah , is there a right kind ? - Well , one can always hope . Don 't tell me , are you my freebie ? All right ! They call me John Blake , " The Snake on the Make . " Freebie ? Oh ! You 're Mr. Blake ! Mr. Blake , our lucky sweepstakes winner . Are we gonna find a mate for you , sir . Right this way . We 're ready for you in Studio 1 . This way . I 've got the feeling ... that " The Snake on the Make " could be Mr. Right . What it is , it is . Whoa . I 'm him ! Really . - You sure are . But is she her ? - Yeah ! Yes . I need to know all about you . " Snake on the Make . " Now , right this way . He might be the one , maybe I should just - We 've got procedures here and you 've got a videotape to make . - A what ? - A videotape ! In here . Oh , they 'll love you . - Is ward in the control room ? - Maybe . What 's the matter ? Don 't tell me ... you 've stopped keeping track of his every move . You 're real cute . Must be the reason why Ward dropped me ... like a lit firecracker when you came through the door . No , I think it was because he was bored . Oh , yeah , that 's right . You stimulate his intellect , don 't you ? Don 't knock it until you 've tried it . Here 's something to stimulate your intellect . I 'm sticking around here , sister . You know why ? Because one day you 're gonna be that lit firecracker . And I intend to be here to enjoy ... the big bang . My advise to you is to get yourself in there ... in front of those cameras ... and cross your fingers . Because it sounds to me like you 're going to be here for quite a while . - How do you feel ? - Invulnerable . Good . I don 't know how long the antidote will last ... so I suggest we make our move this afternoon . No problem . - Is that our delivery boy ? - He doesn 't look like much . But by the end of the day , he will have become famous . Infamous . " The Snake on the Make " to my friends . Among whom I hope to count you before too long . Know what I mean ? Anyway , I fly a helicopter for a living . As a matter of fact ... I 'm one of the very few pilots licensed to fly a chopper ... over our nation 's most sacred monuments and buildings . I take tourists on aerial tours of this great big capital city of ours . Like this afternoon , I started out at Dulles Airport ... picked up a half a dozen good folk . Passed a triple security check . Then I cruised my good folks southward down the Potomac River ... to the Navy Yard and then north . I show them where history 's made . The Capitol building , Library of Congress ... Constitution Hall , National Gallery , Capitol Hill . And finally , a run up Pennsylvania Avenue to the greatest thrill of them all : The White House ! I mean , you haven 't lived ... until you 've looked into the White House windows at 300 feet . The White House , man . You looking for me , Rover ? What you got there ? Your boss just made contact with Compu-Cupid . Lead the way . You , my dear , are a genius . My genius would be a total waste ... were it not for your genius in putting it to use . Shall we get " The Snake on the Make " started on his vacation ? It looks like you 've got another customer . - Better get rid of her first . - Diana Prince ! She 's an IADC agent . She was in the lab with Roberts . - The day you stole the virus , remember ? - She must be on to us . - Get rid of her . - Wait a minute . Are you sure the simulation of an IADC agent wouldn 't come in handy ? Perhaps . Especially a dead IADC agent . Hi . My name is Jessica Abernathy . The Compu-Cupid computer is programmed for two basic functions . As a database for dissemination of information ... regarding persons seeking companionship ... With members of the opposite sex . - A dating service ? - Affirmative . Why didn 't you say so ? Go on . Also as a patented data simulator specializing in ... the 3-dimensional duplication of specific human characteristics . That 's where they 've been making the masks and gloves . Ira , can you identify the people most recently simulated by Compu-Cupid ? - Naturally . - Good . We 've got to find out what they plan to do with that virus . Mrs. Mary Jane Thrip . - After her . - One John Blake . - Okay , who else ? - One Diana Prince . Diana ? This is Col. Trevor . I need a car out front . Immediately ! It really was love at first sight ... thanks to Compu-Cupid . Actually I met him right outside , the minute I walked through the door . Thanks to Compu-Cupid , love at first sight is gonna be a real gas , lady . Maybe I 've talked enough about John Blake . Maybe I should talk about myself . Oh , my gosh ! we 've got a fire here . You better call the fire department . Sweet dreams , baby . How does it look ? Good enough to fool airport security at Dulles . Remember why there won 't be any other passengers . You bought out the whole flight so you can see D.C. from the air . All alone . Let 's go . I told Val to take care of the Prince lady ... as soon as The Snake gets started on his trip . - Is the chopper ready ? - Everything we need is waiting . Including this . - To the White House . - To the White House . Hi . - They used sleeping gas on him . - Diana 's around here somewhere . She 'll be all right . This is the one we 've got to worry about . He 's the one they simulated . This guy ? Why ? That 's what we have to find out . We 've passed airport security , why don 't you take off that mask ? Good idea . Thanks for letting me do the honors . You 're the one that 's hell-bent on teaching the government a lesson . It 's only fair . When my brother died during one of their Doomsday experiments ... no one listened . And recently five more men died . And still no one listened . Now , within the hour ... tens of thousands will have perished . It will start at the White House , descend Capitol Hill ... wipe out all Federal agencies , obliterate the Pentagon . And assure that research into such Doomsday experiments ... is abandoned forever . It 's not very subtle , but most definitely effective . All I know is it was very important to simulate ... that creepo helicopter pilot . Helicopter pilot ? He takes tourists on aerial tours of Washington . - Where ? - How should I know ? - Here 's the playback . - National Gallery ... Constitutional Hall , Library of Congress , Capitol Hill . And then a run up Pennsylvania A venue to the greatest thrill of them all : The White House ! I mean , you ha ven 't lived ... until you 've looked into the White House windows at 300 feet . The White House , man . As a matter of fact ... I 'm one of the very few pilots licensed to fly a chopper ... over our nation 's most sacred monuments and buildings . Charlie ? This is Steve Trevor . Listen carefully . You 've got a full-blown red alert heading your way . Look at that big baby . Hang on , we 're going in . Okay , toss it out . Oh , no . Throw it , Ward , make them learn ! With Ward , Dede and Val in custody ... the best place for that virus is in a furnace . With the addition of the antidote . The virus is harmless . Yes , but what about next time ... a deadly virus is accidentally discovered in a laboratory ? Well , I for one , plan to see that there is no next time . I wish those two young people had thought of another way ... of making their feelings known . Which reminds me . There 's still one thing that bothers me about all this . - What 's that ? - Mrs. Thrip ... why did you go to that dating service ? Well , I wanted to have a bit of fun . And I got tired of waiting for you . Dear girl , have I been so wrapped up in my work ... that I overlooked a gem like you ? Yes ! To rectify the oversight . Compu-Cupid strikes again .

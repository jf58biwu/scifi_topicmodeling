What 'd You Give Him ? Knicks Tickets ? Box Of Cohibas ? A Free Colonic ? It 's My Fault . How So ? Martine Didn 't Return My Calls . I Should Have Known Something Was Wrong . When Was The Last Time You Saw Her ? A Week Ago . She Was Sort Of Living With This Guy . Who ? Carl Browning . He 's A Big Money Guy . Commodities Broker . He Lives On A Yacht . And He 's , Um ... What , Kayla ? I Only Met Him Once . But I Didn 't Like Him . The Way He Ordered Martine Around , Treated Her Like A Possession . I Mean , I Know He Had A Lot Of Money , But I Didn 't Understand What She Saw In Him . Did Martine Have Any Family Here ? She Moved Here From Terre Haute When She Lost Her Folks . Was She An Actress ? She Was Really Talented . Noel Coward . Private Lives . I Was There Opening Night . Not Martine 's Production , Another One . So What 's The Play Tonight ? The Smack ? Too Familiar . The Tip ? Too Risky . The Huge Duke ? Too Complicated . The Wipe ? The Last Turn ? The Hot Seat ? What 's The Con ? Johnny . Come On . No Time For Romance . You 've Got Debts To Retire . The Tat . With A Dame At The Table ? Makes The Grift Better . Mr. Browning . Nypd . It 's About Time . I Called It In Almost A Week Ago . Are You Guys On The Slow Train ? You Called It In ? What , Is There An Echo Here ? I Talked To A Cop . He Said They Were Going To Send Somebody Over To Collect Evidence , But Nothing Happened . We Just Found The Body , Sir . Whose ? Martine Shane . Martine ? Isn 't That What You Called About ? I Called About A Break-In . Martine 's Dead ? But Why Didn 't You Call The Police When You Didn 't Hear From Her ? You Don 't Know Martine . She 's--She Was Unpredictable . That 's What Made It Good With Her . Did You Fight ? Everybody Fights . Did You Ever Hit Her ? You Think I Killed Her ? Talk To My Lawyer . A Ramsden Sextant . Much Truer Than The Astrolabe . Amsterdam . Navigational Tool . We Used It During The War ? Doubt It .

I Use It All The Time . Then It Would Have Recorded Where Your Boat Was Last Week . Take Martine Out A Lot ? You Mean Did I Throw Her Overboard , Detective ? You 'll Have To Get A Warrant To Find Out . Now Get Off My Boat . And Don 't Mistake This For Caring What You Think . But I Loved Martine . We Were Engaged . She Was It . Here You Go , Frances . Thank You . Good Night . Miss . You 're Very Good At That Game . It Was My Lucky Night . Nonsense . Confidence Games Take Skill . You Are A Con Man , Mr. Johnson , Or Whatever Your Name Is ? A Grifter . Look , Miss , My Wife 's In Labor . You 're Not Married . You 're Not The Type . You Think You 're The Gnat 's Whistle , Don 't You . I Don 't Want Any Trouble , Lady . What Do You Want ? I 'm An Actress . I Like Someone 's Who 's Good At Playing A Role . You Could Use A Few Pointers , Though . Well , Maybe You Could Show Them To Me In Person . Maybe I Could . As For What I Want ? Half Your Take Will Do . Ain 't You Got No Shame ? No . What If Some Kid Walked , Saw You In Your Particulars . He 'd Get What He Deserved For Sneaking Into A Closed Facility . That 's What You 're Doing . I Have A Key . From 1935 . So , What You Going To Do ? About What ? You Know What . The Doc . She Came By The Bar , Looking For You . She 's A Good Woman , No Doubt . But She Didn 't Do The Trick . I Don 't Know That . You Were Dead And Then You Weren 't . Like It Or Not , You 're Still Immortal . Maybe We Need To Get Married , Formally , In The Eyes Of God . God Don 't Have Nothing To Do With This . I Like Being With Her . Whether She " Does The Trick " Or Not . This Ain 't Like Your Other Women . With Them , You Didn 't Know For Sure The One Was Out There . Now You Do . Just Because You Look Older , Omar , Doesn 't Mean You Are . I Can Do Without The Advice . This Ain 't Fair To Her , John . What Are You Going To Do When You Realize That The Right Girl Was Someone Else On That Subway Platform ? You Just Going To Dump Sara ? I Told You . I Don 't Know She 's Not It . You Can Keep Playing That Role With Me If You Like . But Can You Play It With Her ? Doesn 't She Deserve The Truth ? I Checked The Dispatch System . Anonymous Male Caller Reported A Dispute On Browning 's Boat Last Week . And The Gps Records Showed The Boat Was Taken Out On The Day Martine Disappeared . Sounds Like A Ground Ball . Maybe . I Hate Baseball Metaphors . Fyi , I Told Burnett You 're At Psychological Counseling . Wishful Thinking . Mr. Browning . You Asked For A Warrant ... Coffee ? Get Your Own . Refreshments Aren 't Included . I Mean , What You Do . You Broker Coffee . I Trade Coffee Futures . Not Interested In The Past ? The Past Is For Suckers . I Thought That Tradition Had Passed . I 'm A Sucker For Tradition . Yeah ? Me , Too . Come On In . I Haven 't Been In This Building In Years . Used To Be You Could Have Your Meals Sent Up By Dumbwaiter From The Dining Hall Downstairs . That Must Have Been A Very Long Time Ago . You Must Have Been A Baby . Martini ? You Have Your Own Stash ? My Own Private Bootlegger . How Do You Take It ? Just Look At The Vermouth , Don 't Pour It . To Actors . Whatever Their Profession . So What 's Your Moniker ? Confidence Men Always Have A Nickname , Don 't They ? Johnny On The Spot . I Like That . That 's A Good Name . Smells Like Bleach . You 're Not Going To Hurl Again Are You ? Maybe He Used It To Clean Up The Blood . You Can 't Cheat An Honest Man . You Think That 's True ? You Asking Me ? I Don 't Know Many Honest Men . We Found This Towel In The Bathroom . Even Odds , Vic 's Blood . You 're Wasting Your Time . Guys Are Always Working On The Boat . One Of Them Probably Cut Himself . We 'll Soon Find Out . Don 't Go Too Far , Mr. Browning . I Think You Can . What ? Con An Honest Man . If You 're Good At It . Bingo . There 's No Magic . We Use Psychological Profiles , In-Depth Questionnaires , An Extensive Database , And Then We Put People Together Who Have Similar Wants And Needs . That 's The Problem . There 's No Magic . You Don 't Believe In Matchmaking ? Well , It 's A Romantic Shell Game . Lonely Men Are Easy Marks . Excuse My Partner . What He Knows About Relationships Wouldn 't Fill A Thimble . Are You Single , Detective ? You Might Want To Try Out Our Service . Oh , Please . Don 't Waste Your Time . So What Can You Tell Us About Martine And Carl Browning ? They Met Through You ? It 's A Terrible Tragedy . I Still Can 't Believe It . Mr. Browning Was A Client . He Met Martine At One Of Our Events . They Seemed Happy . We 'd Like To See Their Files . Unfortunately , I Can 't Do That . You Can 't Or You Won 't ? In My Business , Confidentiality Is Everything . The People Who Seek Us Out Are Of A Certain Station And They Depend On Our Discretion . We Can Go To Court . We Have Psychologists On Staff , So Our Clients Are Protected By Doctor / Patient Privilege . That 's A Stretch . As Cops , We Know A Lot Of Reporters . We Can Choose To Give Them Details Of Your Involvement , Or You Can Depend On Our Discretion . What Do You Want To Know ? Let 's Start With Anybody Else Martine Went Out With . We Were So Good Together . We Had Like A Binary Thing . I Don 't Understand . The Usual Base 2 System Is A Positional Notation With A Radix Of 2 . It 's How Computers Work . Zeros And Ones . So What Happened ? We Crashed . You Asked Her To Marry You ? Twice . I Opened Myself Up And She Laughed At Me . That Make You Mad ? Well , We 'd Been Going Out For Three Weeks . How Would You Feel ? I Loved Her , But I Can 't Believe She 's Gone . I Always Thought We 'd End Up Together . She Filed A Restraining Order Against You . Says You Stalked Her For Months . I Needed To Prove It To Her . That You Loved Her . When You Find The Right Person , You Have No Choice . You Do What You Need To Do . All My Songs Are About That . It Was Never Going To Work . We Had Different Interests . Have We Met Before ? I Have One Of Those Faces . Martine And I Went Out A Few Times , Antique Shows , That Sort Of Thing . She Was Bored . There Was No Click . Benwaar . That 's Who You Look Like . Who 's Benwaar ? Turn-Of-The-Century Furniture Maker . I 've Sold A Few Of His Pieces . Very Hard To Find . My God , You 're A Dead Ringer For Him . When Was The Last Time You Saw Martine ? Oh , Let 's See . First Week Of September . I Remember Because It Was Right Before The Break-In . You Were Burglarized ? And They Had Good Taste , Too . Stole The Silver , Left The Plate . Took The Lynch-Bages And The Moutons , Left The Rotgut . Robbed Me Blind . Your Hunch Was Right . All The Guys Martine Went Out With Were Ripped Off . Right After She Stopped Seeing Them . Pros ? Evidently . In And Out Fast . Seemed To Know Where The Valuables Were And The Security Codes . There Had To Be An Inside Man ... Or Woman . Our Victim Was A Thief . So Who Wasted Her ? One Of The Jilted Lovers ? Possibly . I Still Like Browning For It . He Found Out She Was Playing Him And Then He Killed Her . Amsterdam . On Our Way . Let 's Ask Him . Browning Just Tried To Kill Himself . Figures . You Should Be In The Hospital . You 're Concerned About My Well Being . I 'm Touched . You Want To Tell Us Why You Did This ? Get Lost . Guilt Too Much To Live With ? My Only Regret Is Not Cutting Deeper . That Way , I Wouldn 't Be Here Talking To You . Mr. Browning , Your Fiance Wasn 't Who She Seemed To Be . We Think She Was Part Of A Burglary Ring . She Used The Dating Service To Meet Wealthy Men And Rip Them Off , Including You . Must 've Been Brutal , Huh , Carl ? To Find Out Martine Didn 't Love You . That She Stole From You . That She Was Using You . You Don 't Get It , Detective . I Knew She Was A Thief . She Told Me Everything . I Didn 't Care . Even After She Ripped You Off . If She Ripped Me Off . And I 'll Never Believe She Did . Ever . Why 'd You Do This ? I Miss Her . Isn 't That Enough ? I Found A Buyer For It . It 'll Fetch A Pretty Penny . It 's Not For Sale . Baloney . What 're You Gonna Do With It , Wear It ? I 'm Thinking Of Giving It Back . Well , Now I Know You 're Bent . That Dame Chiseled In On Our Play . Now She Got A Nice Chassis , But Come On . There 's Something Between Us . Johnny On The Spot 's In Love ? You Told Me--Only Saps Fall In Love . When You Get Tired Of Looking Around , It 's Easier To Say That . She 's A Mark . She 's Different . Then Why 'd You Steal The Pin ? Don 't Kid Yourself , Kiddo . Everyone 's A Mark . Heard About Your Shooting . Tough . Wrong Time , Wrong Place . I Got Shot Once Myself , Right In The Ass . Couldn 't Sit Down For Weeks . So , What Do They Do ? Sit Me Behind A Desk . So What 's The Deal ? These High-End Burglaries You 're Working , We Think They 're Related To A Homicide . How ? The Victim Went Out With All The Marks . The Theory Is She Met Them Through A Dating Service , Gained Access To Their Apartments , Keys , Security Codes , You Name It . So Who Killed Her ? One Of The Marks ? Maybe . Probably . Well , We 've Already Recovered Some Of The Items . Fenced By A Turd Named Ray De La Cruz . What Stone Can He Be Found Under ? He 's In The Wind . There 's A Want Card Out On Him . But If You Come Across Him , Watch Your Ass . He 's Armed And Dangerous . What A Coincidence . So Are We . I 'll Talk To You . Unless De La Cruz Is Hiding Under Your Desk , You Got Nothing To Worry About . Where Do You Think You 're Going ? Therapy . I 'm Working Through My Feelings Of Homicidal Rage . You Think This Is A Game , Amsterdam ? You Could Put Your Partner In Jeopardy . I Want You Off The Street . Give Me Your Weapon . I Wouldn 't Want You To Use It On The Wrong Person . Like You ? His Name Is Ray De La Cruz . He 's A Fence , Deals In High-End Goods . Keep Your Ears Open . I Need To Run Him To Ground . Thanks , Omar . Gotta Go . Ms. Skoll ? Got A Minute ? For You , Detective , I 've Got Two . Can We Walk ? I 'm Meeting Someone For Lunch . Some Bad News . We Have Evidence That Martine Shane Was A Thief . That She Used Your Service To Meet Wealthy Guys And Rip Them Off . That 's Not Possible . We Do Thorough Background Checks . How 'd She Come To Your Attention ? I Don 't Recall . A Reference , I Think . I 'd Have To Check My Files . I Just Can 't Believe She 'd Do That . She Had Nothing . A Waitress From Nowhere Who Wanted To Be Discovered Like A Thousand Other Girls . We Offered Her A Life . I 'd Really Like To Know Who Gave You That Reference . I 'll Get Back To You . Ok ? Hello , Kayla . Detective . I Was Wondering If I Could Take A Look Around . I 'm Running Out . Actually , I Have A Client . Pilates . Contrology . Union Of Mind And Body . Created During Wwi To Help Wounded Vets . Worked For Me . I 'll Only Be A Minute . A Thief ? That 's Ridiculous . People Aren 't Always What They Seem . Do You Know How Martine Got Into Soul Mates ? The Owner , I Think . I Can 't Remember Her Name . Inga Skoll . Right . She Spotted Her At The Restaurant Where She Was Working . Did Martine Ever Talk About Inga ? Not That I Can Remember . How About Her Dates ? She Talk About Them ? Not Much . She Knew That I Thought It Was Sort Of Silly . I Mean , Martine Didn 't Need A Service To Get Men . They Found Her . I 'm Sorry , I 'm Really Going To Be Late . You Were Good Friends ? I Thought We Were . But As You Said , People Aren 't Always What They Seem . Do You Mind If I Take This With Me ? The Blood On The Towel We Found In Browning 's Boat Is A Match With Our Vic 's . Burnett Wants Us To Pick Him Up . Can 't Help You . I 'm On Desk Duty . Since When Has That Made A Difference ? And Burnett Is Playing With My Gun . Take Santori . [ Cell Phone Rings ] Hey , Omar . What 've You Got ? Ray De La Cruz . Whoa . Nice-Looking Dog . He 's A Fighter ? More Of A Lover , Ray . We Need To Talk . Go On ! Finish Him ! Go On ! Get Him Off Of Me . Get Him Off Of Me , Come On ! Get Him Off Of Me ! I Don 't Care Much About Me . But You Shot At My Dog , Ray . You Really Shouldn 't Have Done That . Ok , Ok . I 'm Sorry . I 'm Sorry . Look , He 'll Kill Me . Yeah , But He 'll Hurt You First . No Smoking . I Want A Lawyer . You 'll Need One . Resisting Arrest , Possessing Stolen Goods , Murder . Whoa , Whoa , Whoa , Whoa , Whoa . Hold Up , Man . What The Hell You Talking About ? She Probably Looked A Little Better Before You Tossed Her In The River . Martine Shane . What Happened , Ray ? You Get In A Professional Dispute ? Wait A Minute . I 'm Out There Doing A Little Business . I Didn 't Kill Nobody . I Don 't Know Her . You Were Fencing Goods From Her Jobs . I Never Seen Her Before . Who 'd You Deal With ? You Know Someone Named Inga Skoll ? Look , Man , We Did It By Drop , All Right ? They Would Contact Me By A Pay Phone . I Never Knew Her Name . But It Was A Woman ? The Best Thieves Are Always Women . Are You Ok , John ? Go Back To Sleep . Already Up . You Don 't Exactly Seem Like The High School Reunion Type . Searching For A Murder Suspect . She Could Be In This Class . Under A Different Name . Well , She 'll Still Be There In The Morning . Hmm . I Know You Didn 't Kill Her . He Does ? What About The Bloody Towel ? The Towel Was Planted . That Was The Point Of The Break-In . Not To Rob You . To Frame You . Took You Long Enough To Figure That Out . Yeah . It Reminded Me Of Something In My Past . A Burglary That Wasn 't A Burglary . So Who Did It ? So Who Did It ? Must Have Been One Of The Thieves . What Did The Burglars Take ? Exactly ? Not Much . Some Cash That Was Lying Around . A Watch . An Old Patek-Phillipe . Some Diamond Cufflinks . Is That It ? A Few Things Of Martine 's . Nothing Valuable . This Little Friendship Ring , You Know , The Irish Kind ... A Claddagh Ring . Yeah , Yeah . Once I Gave Her The Engagement Ring , She Didn 't Really Wear It Anymore . Tell Me About The Engagement Ring . Three Carats , Flawless Clarity . A Real Beauty . Now It 's At The Bottom Of The River . She Ever Talk About Her Former Lovers ? She Knew It 'd Make Me Crazy . It 's Not Like I Had Illusions She Was A Virgin . I Just Didn 't Want To Hear . Once I Heard Her Fighting With Someone Over The Phone . Sounded Like An Ex . Don 't Think He Was Too Happy About Her Leaving . Now I Know How The Guy Felt . Now That You Know My Whole Story . I Know Nothing . You 're A Complete Mystery . You Know My Moniker . Only My Close Friends And The Bulls Know That . So What About You ? Are You Really Olivia Behrendt ? Paula Dorn From Grand Rapids , Michigan . Ah , Your Scars . Does Each One Come With A Story ? What Can I Say ? I 'm Easily Hurt . Ditto . Falling For A Grifter Is A Recipe For Heartbreak . Ditto With Actresses . You Never Know What 's Real . Exactly . Well , This Is Real . Detective Amsterdam . Where Is He ? He Asked Me To Meet Him Here At 4 : 00 . It 's Been Half An Hour . He 'll Be Here Soon . Are You Single , Detective ? There Are Some Guys Out There Who Might Find The Cop Thing A Turn-On . Thank You . I 'm Celibate . Who The Hell Do You Think You 're Talking To ? ! You Think I Give A Rat 's Ass About What Happened To You Last Week ? Huh ? What , Am I Supposed To Cry For You ? You Know , Just Because You Almost Died ? Well , Boo Hoo . Go To Hell . Always Trying To Be The Hero . Never Listening To What Anybody Says . Getting Killed Is What Happens To Cops Like You . Her What Do You Know About Being A Cop ? You Only Play At Being One . Sitting In Your Little Office Reading Your Little Reports , You Second-Rate Bureaucrat . Amsterdam ! Thing To Me , Huh ? Come On , Hombre . Come On . You Don 't Like It Because I Don 't Play The Game . I Won 't Kiss Your Ass . Which Isn 't That Great , By The Way . The Way You Twitch It Around Here , You 'd Think It Was One Of The Seven Wonders Of The Modern World . That Is It . You Are On Suspension Get Him Out Of Here Now ! You Want My Badge , Little Miss Sunshine , You Got It ! Calm Down , John ! Get Out Of My Way . Detective ? Not Anymore . Where The Hell 's A Cab ? Where Are You Going ? To The Nearest Bar . I 've Got A Car . A White Wine . Your Best Single Malt . Bring The Bottle . You 're Not Serious . Do I Look Serious ? Hey , John , Come On . Do We Have To Go Somewhere Else ? I 'm Sorry About What Happened . I Don 't Need Your Sympathy . I 'm About To Break The Case And That Bitch Can 't Stand That I 'm A Better Cop On Disability Than She Is On Her Best Day . Happy Times . You Said You Were About To Break The Case ? Let 's Stop Playing Charades , Inga . Or Should I Call You Susie ? I Don 't Know What You 're Talking About . Sure You Do . You Set It All Up . The Burglaries . You Were Ray De La Cruz 's Contact . That 's Not True . And You Know What ? I Don 't Care . A Couple Hours Ago , Maybe . But Not Now . I Don 't Care That You Used To Be Susie Bartkowski From Jersey , That You 've Been Sued Three Times , That You 're Up To Your Ass In Debt , That You Spotted The Marks And Martine Got You In . I ... Don 't ... Care . What Do You Want ? I Have A Piece Of Information . And I 'm--I 'm Willing To Sell It . Go On . Browning Keeps A Safe On His Boat . Inside It There 's An Emerald Pin That Napoleon Gave Josephine , Or Some Such Crap . It 's Worth Millions . Browning Bought It For Martine As A " Symbol Of His Love . " Now , Because Of Our Search , I Got The Combination To That Safe . And The New Security Code To The Boat . Care For Another Drink , Detective ? Why Not ? Hello , Kayla . You Bastard ! You Set Us Up . This Is Entrapment . Well , Actually , It 's What 's Known In The Trade As A Long Con. I Knew About Inga . I Just Had To Make Sure About You . You Killed Martine . I Loved Her . That 's Why You Killed Her . Because She Stopped Loving You Back . You 're Crazy . You Even Cut Off Her Finger To Get The Ring That Was The Symbol Of Her Betrayal . No . That 's Where The Bloody Towel Came From . No . You Have No Proof . We Will Once Csu Is Finished . My Guess Is They 'll Find Traces Of Martine 's Blood At Your Place And Probably Her Engagement Ring . Saved It , Didn 't You , Kayla ? She Hurt Me . Yeah . That 's Not A Good Enough Reason . Nice Work , Detective . Particularly The Drunk Scene . Apple Juice . Been In Aa For Years . Personally , I Thought The Fight With Sarge Was Overplayed . How 'd You Know About Us ? Psychological Profiles , In-Depth Questionnaires , An Extensive Database . Then We Match The Likely Perps With The Victims . No Magic To It . Wow . You Really Are A Romantic . Amsterdam , I Only Have One Question For You . Did You Really Mean What You Said About My Ass ? So How Did You Know ? Well , It Turns Out Inga And Kayla Went To The Same High School In Jersey . I Saw A Picture Of Them On Their Class Reunion Website . As Juvies , They 'd Gotten Into Some Trouble Together But Under Different Names . Now , When Inga Came Up With This Scam , They Needed A Third Party . Who Better Than Kayla 's Girlfriend ? It 's Funny . Inga Set Martine Up With Possible Marks . She Just Didn 't Count On Her Falling In Love With One Of Them . Well , Men And Women . It 's A Crap Shoot . I 've Told You , I Wasn 't Stealing It . I Was Putting It Back . So You 're Saying You Stole It Before . Yes , But- - Don 't Explain . It Doesn 't Help . Should Have Known Better . Once A Grifter , Always A Grifter . I Think You Should Leave Now . You 're Not Calling The Bulls ? Why Would I ? I Care About You . I Care About Us . There Is No Us . Here . Since It Means So Much To You . I Don 't Want It Anymore . Don 't Worry About It , Johnny . It 's Only Paste . It Isn 't Real . Just Like You . No Bag ? It 's Casual , But Not That Casual . I 'm Not Going . Really . So This Is It . I Told You I Wouldn 't Lie To You . Ok . What Do You Call What You 've Been Doing The Last Couple Months ? Sara . No , I Want To Know . I Told You The Truth . And You Didn 't Want To Hear It . That You Were 400 Years Old ? That Omar Was Your Son ? ! I Mean , What 's Next ? Little Green Men That Live In Your Shoe ? ! I Don 't Expect You To Understand . You 're Right . I Don 't . Not Even A Little . You 're Either A Congenital Liar Or Delusional . Sara . That Bullet , When It Went Through Your Heart , It Killed Something . It Killed Us . Is There Someone Else ? No . But You Had To Think About It . Yeah . That 's For Hurting Me . Where Are You Going ? As Far Away From You As Possible .

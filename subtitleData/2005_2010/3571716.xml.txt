Memories , but they 're not my memories . Not exactly . I 'll touch something , and ... It 's freaking me out . - uh , i 've read about this . It 's called psychometrics . It has something to do with seeing the history Of an object , where it 's been , What it 's experienced . - so what i 'm seeing , it 's real ? - possibly . i don 't know , why ? What are you seeing ? - you remember kelly houston ? - kelly houston . Before or after she ran away and broke your heart ? - i don 't think she ran away , pete . I just don 't know . I touched my old baseball hat , And i got a flood of images Of her and me in a pool . I know how all of this must sound . But she was dead , And there was blood everywhere . - you think somebody killed her ? - i don 't know . If what i 'm seeing is real , then yeah . What would you do ? - then you got to find the truth . Go by the house . I mean , her mother still lives there , right ? - millie ? yeah . - okay . You want me to go with you ? - no , it 's my mess . I 'll clean it up . - tell me the truth , claire . Why are you here ? You checking up on the old man ? - no. can 't a daughter just drop in On her father unannounced ? I worry about you . Since mom 's gone and the company 's not around , You just seem plan-less . You always have a plan . - i 'm fine . - that " fine " sounds very unconvincing to me . You 're not fine . You 're living off of cereal and japanese take-out . - well , that is a good point . tonight , i order italian . - what about a job ? - what about it ? - well , i know it 's a down economy and all , But i 'm sure there 's something you can do . - my particular skills aren 't really all that marketable . - that is not true . You were middle management of primatech papers For over 20 years . - during which time , my skills consisted of Lying to my family , breaking down doors , Bagging and tagging . - on the plus side , you are a people person . - [ laughs ] - look . ooh . Lumber salesman . Minimum five years sales experience . Ta-da ! - you do know that was a cover , right ? I never actually sold anything . - yes , but you don 't have to admit to that . Okay , say you 're at the interview , And i 'm the interviewer , and you 're the interviewee . - oh , are we really- - - [ clears throat ] Tell me , mr. bennet , What do you think your greatest strength As a salesman is ? - well , if they won 't buy from me , I can always just shoot them . - nathan petrelli . - millie . - what are you doing here ? - reminiscing about kelly . I happened to be in the neighborhood . Thought i 'd stop by and say hello . - that calls for a drink . What can i get you ? - oh , nothing . i 'm fine , thanks . - sit down , nathan . Nobody ever talks to me about kelly . Guess they figure it 's a sore subject . Truth is , i 'm made of sturdier stuff . So ... ? - i was just going through some old things in my office . I started thinking about kelly . Got to wondering if you- if i 'd heard from her ? Well , i wish i could say that i have . Wish i could say That all this time , she 's been living In the south of france . That she became an artist . That she has a daughter named francois . - do you ever wonder If maybe she didn 't run away ? - to be perfectly honest , there was a time When i thought maybe you knew more than you were saying . After all , we were away that weekend , And you were in town , nathan . And i knew that you and kelly Had been seeing each other . I never told your mother , But i hired a private investigator . Turns out , you 're in the clear . Kelly , in fact , used her credit card To buy a one-way ticket to london heathrow Where she claimed her checked baggage , And no one has seen or heard from her since . - you think it 's possible Something else might have happened , millie ? - trust me , i 've been over this ad nauseam . Kelly was willful and spiteful And full of herself . Add to that , me not being The most attentive of mothers . It 's no wonder she ran off . I 've got a hair , nail and body sculpting thing , And i don 't want to be late . - i understand . - so , you 'll show yourself out ? - of course . Here you go . Broke out the good stuff . - i 've already had too much . And my mom would kill me if she found out . - there 's no way she 'll find out . - you 're right . You know , my folks won 't be back until monday . - is that an invitation ? - do you want it to be ? - i don 't know . you 've been drinking . I wouldn 't want to take advantage . - don 't be such a prude . You want it , nathan ? come and get it . Come on , nathan . Come and get it . - you better give me that . - come and get it . - come here . - no . [ gasps ] - no ! - you wanted to see me ? - millie called . Chardonnay . She said you came to her asking questions about kelly . Do you have any idea what your trip down memory lane Is doing to that poor woman ? Thank you . - kelly didn 't disappear . She died . I was there . What i want to know is why i can 't remember any of it . - how would i know ? - because every time there 's a secret buried someplace , I find you with shovel behind your back . - you should write mother 's day cards . - i 'm going to get to the bottom of this , One way or the other , so you can tell me , or ... - fine , i took care of it . And you don 't need to know the details . - you made sure i wouldn 't remember anything , Didn 't you ? - you were drunk and foolish , so , yes , i took care of it . All of it . I had the haitian wipe your memory . I disposed of her body . I bought the plane ticket to london . - it was an accident . - well , it didn 't look like one , dear . So what would you have me do ? Her death would have ruined your life . - i 'm just waiting for the part that makes any of this okay . - i made a choice to protect my son . You want to vilify me for that ? Fine , i have been vilified for so much less . But , please , nathan , Don 't destroy yourself over this . - so what , you 're going to have your old friend millie Go on believing that her daughter ran away Because she was a bad mother ? - yes , millie has made her peace with this . I suggest you do the same . I 'll be in touch . - did you forget something ? - there 's something i need to tell you , millie , And i 'm not sure how to do it . - you all right , nathan ? - look , i can 't tell you how i know this , But i 'm not really sure i should . - what are you talking about ? Say it . - kelly didn 't run away . she died . And i was there . it was an accident . And it was my fault . - she got on a plane . - there was no plane ticket . She died , millie . And the whole thing was covered up by my ... Family . - what kind of twisted , pathetic game are you playing ? - i 'm just trying to tell you the truth for once . - i think you should leave . Please . Go . - i 'm sorry . - so you never answered the question . Greatest strength . - greatest strength . Well , i would have to say that above all else , I am a company man . You won 't find anybody More dedicated to his job than me . - see , that 's perfect . What lumber company wouldn 't want to hire you ? - yup , i 'm a real people person . - what 's the matter ? - oh , i don 't know . It 's just , you know , kind of sad When you look back on your life And you realize it hasn 't amounted to much . - what are you talking about ? Your whole life has been about trying to help people . - has it ? 'cause all i see is pain . I shot them , cuffed them , locked them up , Wiped their memories , But i don 't remember actually helping anybody . - that 's not true . You 've helped plenty of people . - yeah , name one . - me . Life changes . we all change . Sometimes you have to remember who you were To figure out who you want to be . - why do i suddenly feel like you 're the parent , And i 'm the kid ? - we 'll take turns . - yeah . - so , you don 't really want to sell lumber , huh ? - nope , not at all . - [ laughs ] [ phone rings ] - hiro . - fancy meeting you here . Am i that predictable ? - you live upstairs . How are you ? - okay . So what brings you to my neighborhood ? - i got my old job back , with governor maiden . - well , that was quick . Good for you . Let 's celebrate . i 'll buy you a tuna roll . - yeah , i 'm not really hungry . - so why are you here ? - i don 't know . - you got your life back , tracy . And that 's what you wanted . Isn 't it ? - it just feels like something 's missing . Something needs to change . - well , you got a job in government . That 's a good start . - please , maiden isn 't about helping people . - then quit . - i can 't . Do you know how many people Would kill for my position ? - life changes , tracy . We have to change with it . Maybe you just can 't go home again . Maybe you have to remember who you were To figure out who you want to be . - oh , i got to go . I have a dinner with maiden , and i can 't be late . Thanks for the advice , though . - any time . [ classical music ] ? - oh , i can 't tell you how great it is To have you back , trace . - [ laughs ] - i missed you . - it 's nice to be missed . - yeah . Uh , cosmo still your drink ? One cosmo , please . Look at us , huh ? Just like old times . - kind of . [ chuckles ] This job ... I want it to be more . I want to set agendas , Help people who can 't help themselves . - so much for small talk . - i want a job where i 'm making A real difference in people 's lives . - trace , you don 't have to work so hard to impress me . We both know what you bring to the table . Tell you what . Why don 't we skip dinner ? Let 's go upstairs . Make each other happy . Just like old times . - will you excuse me for a moment ? - sure , yeah . don 't be long . [ water dripping ] - [ whimpers ] Dear god . - there you go . Everything okay , baby ? - no . No , everything 's not okay . - i don 't understand . - i wouldn 't expect you to . - hello , yes . I 'd like to speak with someone in the homicide division . Yeah , i 'll hold . - i 've been looking for you . what 's the matter ? You are thinking about something . Is it the new people That samuel 's bringing into the family ? - you think he 'd be bringing in more If joseph was alive ? - i don 't know . It was his brother , And he has a right to his revenge . - no matter what it means for the rest of us ? - i 'll tell you what it means . I 'm the one who 's left to make all the decisions For this family . I 'm the one that decides which direction we travel . - we were just talking is all . - come with me . Time to find another . - [ screams ] - you know you can tell me anything , don 't you ? - of course . - if anyone tells you they 're dissatisfied with me , If you 're dissatisfied . - i 'm not dissatisfied . - good . What are you doing ? Why are you showing him to me ? - i show you what you need to see . - why would i need to see bennet ? He retired . He 's no longer interested in us . - he may have changed his mind . - nathan seemed very confused . Wanted to make sure i heard his side of the story . It was upsetting To say the least . - well , nathan has always been overly theatrical . You know , i 'm sure that 's why He 's drawn to the spotlight of politics . What exactly did he say ? - i feel so silly telling you this . - no , please . he 's my son . I want to know . - he said that kelly was dead . That he was with her when she died . I told him , " no , she bought a ticket , Got on a plane , never looked back . " - millie , i am so sorry That he bothered you with this . Nathan--nathan just hasn 't been himself lately . - you know how much i 've always cared for nathan . - i apologize for his behavior . No one should have to go through that pain twice . - i can honestly say i don 't care anymore . I just hope kelly 's happy . I think that 's About as close to closure as i 'm ever going to get .

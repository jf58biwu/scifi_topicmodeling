 Hey , Doc . Found something you might be interested in . All right , what 's so important that ... - That 's my shirt . - Is it ? Found it in that box . - Take it off . You 're stretching it out ! - What do you care ? It 's been in a box for 20 years . Are you throwing this stuff out ? 'Cause who can 't use another sweater vest ? - Cool guys ? - It 's way too tight . You look ridiculous . - Yeah , you look great . - Insults . That 's why you called me away from my spring cleaning ? No . Check this out . Well , it 's old , but we could probably get a few bucks for it . - Good find . - Not the camera , what I found inside it . Hello , Rusty ... - It 's grandpa ! He 's alive ! - And trapped in the phantom zone . I was just kidding . Jezz , I 'm not a ' tard . - You were always such a little video buff ... - Once ! I told him once I wanted to make videos . Next thing you know ... every holiday it 's cameras , " How-to " books ... See , pop , I 've been meaning to tell you , I 'm not really that into neckerchiefs . - You wear them well . - Wait . What did he say ? Go back . What I have to tell you is a matter of the gravest importance , Rusty . It has to do with those mysterious , deep space radio signals . You know , the ones I received back when you were just a boy . But what does it mean ? You can 't walk on the red ones 'cause they 're lava . Rusty , please ! Well , after ten long years , I finally translated the broadcasts . I found something extraordinary ! A message from far across time and space , addressed to me personally . It has to do with my latest invention , the greatest of my career or anyone 's ... which I completed only a week ago ! Turn it up . I smell money . They warned me that mankind was still too immature to be trusted with it . They told me to dismantle it before it got into the wrong hands . But they also told me that the fate of the planet ... hinged upon my machine being activated once . That 's why I 've scattered the main components ... in secret locations across the globe , so no one ... Someone 's coming ! They know ! False alarm . OK . Get a pen . Once assembled , the device must be activated at precisely midnight ... in New York City , on May 4 of your 44th year . - Doc , that 's , like , tomorrow . - Should I fail to live to see that day ... it will be up to you , Rusty . Good luck , Godspeed ... and go , Team Venture ! First base is on Spider Skull Island . Damn it , my brother ! - Big man . - Yes , Dean , you 're a big man now . Brock and I ... Ladysmith Black Mambazo ! Step back ! I have traveled from an incredibly distant star ... to observe the ways of your planet . - I can feel it in my chewies . - You have the honor ... of representing your entire race as my sample subjects . There 's a 12-foot man in our pool pointing a beam at my head . - Do something ? - Whispering is futile ! The Grand Galactic Inquisitor hears all , sees all ! Look , we don 't have time for this , OK ? We 're on a very tight ... Do not speak to me ! Do not alter your normal human behavior in any way ! You know not the elaborate criteria by which you are to be judged . Ignore my presence and go about your earthly business ! Here are some hand turkeys from Thanksgiving , 1968 ... and a bunch of your old homeworks . Neat ! You wrote a fan letter to the Herculoids when you were ten ? ! Hey , horses ! It 's not a fan letter . He calls them hippies for not fighting in Vietnam . Ignore me ! Swing around back and have the X-2 running . I 'll only be a minute . They 'll never even know we were here . ¿ Qué es eso ? Ahoy ! Who goes there ? Jeez , it 's you people . - It 's that ghost pirate again ! - Who isn 't a ghost . - Or a pirate even really . - What are you doing here ? Yeah , well , you never seem to use the boat ... so I kinda started sleeping here , only a couple of nights a week at first . You try finding a job with nothing on your resume but fake ghost pirate . - Get to the point . - Yeah , yeah , jeez . Anyhoo , I wakes up one day and there 's this little fella standing there ... and he tells me it 's his boat now , ' cause your pa ' et him up when he was wee . He hired me on as his ship 's captain ... so really it 's kinda more my boat than yours at this point . Met her last week in Ibiza . At Fiesta Scientifico . - It 's not serious . - That was last week ? Damn Post Office must 've lost my invitation . I 'm sure . Here we are . So , let 's have a look at this famous tape of yours . It will be up to you , Rusty . Good luck , Godspeed , and go , Team Venture ! That part always chokes me up . Well I did have a pitch at the Pentagon tomorrow , but I guess I can move it . This seems pretty important . Who invited you ? ! Just lend us the damn boat for a few hours ! You can 't do this alone , Rust . Three more pieces scattered around the globe ? - In 16 hours ? - What are you thinking ? Two teams ? - Brock ! - Three . You take the X-1 . The Captain and I 'll take the X-2 . The boys can pick up the fourth piece in the X-X-1 . - We 'll rendezvous in New York . - Hello ! Who 's running this show ? ! Everyone ready ? Go , Team Venture ! So much cooler than ours . We got to get uncle JJ to make one of these for pop . Space Invaders ! He 's got Space Invaders in the lounge ! And he 's got a lounge ! Jesus Jones ! Now there was a band ... Yippers , back in the summer of ' 91 . We all thought they was going to be the future of rock and roll . - They sound great . - Were great . - They 're not around anymore ? - No , sir , not so 's anyone 'd notice it . I 'll throw up . Quest Bell One . This is Jonas Venture Jr . Request permission to board . Come on , Rusty . Keep it up . I can help , pop . No , Jonas ! No ! I was doing fine ! Let go ! - I don 't want your help ! - Wake up , Doc . Wake up ! We 're almost there . I thought I was done with those crappy dreams . That was a weird one . - Great . You can read my mind . - Ignore me ! Yes , I can . Hello ! Colonel Gentleman ? - Where are you ? - Are you home ? - Maybe he 's not here . - Pop said he 'd radio him we were coming . Pop forgets my name half the time . Come on . Let 's look around . Maybe he left , like , a note or something . Found him ! Colonel Gentleman ? Hi . It 's Hank and Dean Venture . We 're here for ... - Are you cops ? - Cops ? Us ? Are ... you ... cops ? Let me handle this , Chairman . No , sir . We ain 't five-0 . - You holding ? - No , we ain 't captain . Holding ? We 're just looking for an old gizmo about yay big . Few years back this fella 's old man left it with your old man . - My old man ? - Yes . Your father was ... Don 't you talk about my father ! Don 't touch him ! You can 't get cooties from a dead body , Dean . That 's a total myth . Not cooties , Hank . Clueties . We need to preserve the crime scene because I smell a mystery . Well , I smell dead guy . We don 't have time for mystery , Sherlock Homo . If we don 't find that piece of grandpa 's thing , then ... then ... Wait . What happens if we don 't find that piece of grandpa 's thing ? I don 't know . All right , all right . Just put the gun down , will ya ? You wouldn 't want to hurt the doctor , would ya ? You 're a doctor ? Well , I ... I 'm not a medical doctor . I just have a PhD . That 's right . He 's a doctor . And he can write you a prescription for ... anything you might need . Right . What seems to be the trouble , Mr. Quest ? I 'm in real pain . Check this out . " Dear diary , another dreary party at the Frost 's flat ... " but , oh , the bitches were in rare form tonight . " Skip ahead . Maybe later he talks about grandpa 's thing . Wait . There 's some kind of a list . Could be a clue . " Toys Colonel Gentleman wishes he had when he was a lad . " But they weren 't invented yet . Micronauts , Scooby-Doo Monster Game ... Which Witch , AT-AT Imperial Walker . Stay Alive , The Survival Game . What is that , code ? " Colonel Gentleman 's good names for an imaginary friend . " " Colonel Gentleman 's Hollywood actresses who need a smack in the mouth . " They go on and on . This is a crazy person 's diary . You found it ! Good eye , Hank . Venture 2 to Venture 1 ! We 're coming in for a landing ! Do you copy ? Roger , Venture 2 . You 're clear for landing . Next stop , New York . Stop your sourpussing . We got what you needed . One impossible Plaza . Worldwide headquarters of lmpossible Industries ... and allegedly the most technologically advanced skyscraper in the nation . Yeah , so ? But what stood in this very spot 20 years ago ? Anyone ? It was Venture Industries World Headquarters , thank you . Somewhere in that foundation is the last piece of my father 's little puzzle . And Professor impossible 's just going to let you dig up his basement . How about you stick to the heavy lifting ... and leave the heavy thinking to the super scientist ? Doc 's got something even my brother doesn 't have . Someone on the inside . Going somewhere , Sally ? I just have to pick a few things up at the store , Richard . Stop that nonsense . I 'll send a man out . - Just type up a little list and ... - No , I want to go . - I need some fresh air . - Well , all right . I 'll allow it this one time . - Will you be taking the child ? - Ned 's going to watch him . - I 'm not really ... comfortable with that . - Why not ? He 's retarded , Sally . You 've seen Of Mice and Men . You know what can happen . Please ! Can 't you just leave the child with Huggy ? Stop calling him the child , Richard ! His name is Rocket ! And I 'm not leaving him with your crappy robot ! Sally , why , that 's almost churlish . And you 're visible . What 's this really about ? You can 't replace family with a robot , Richard . We need real human affection . That 's why Huggy 's programmed to simulate it , sweetness . Please , Richard . Let me go . Yes , yes . Perhaps the fresh air will ... calm the ... female ... Don 't strain yourself , Richard . Good-bye . Real human affection . Perhaps a pill or a burst of Gamma radiation or ... Wait a minute . Sally , wait ! Would you like some company ? Hello again ... Sally . Dr. Venture ! When you called me , I couldn 't believe it . You never answered any of my letters . I worried you 'd forgotten me and moved on but I never gave up hope . The only thing that made my life bearable , was the hope that someday ... you 'd come for me and Rocket . - Where is your boy Ruck ... Rocky , was it ? - Rocket . I had his uncle Ned take him to the park just where you said . You 're sure he didn 't say anything to your husband ? No , no . I promised him a great big ice cream cone if he could keep a secret . - Ice cream ! - No , dude . Wait . We 're supposed to stay on the ... Give it ! Give me the ice cream ! Nap time . Someone want to help me with the human callous here ? Anyone ? A little help ? Sally , there is something I need you to do for me ... before we go off and live happily ever after . Dr. Venture , anything . Just do one thing for me . Pinch me , because I must be dreaming . I can 't believe you 're really here ! It 's OK , lady . I see him , too ! This is just ... wrong , man , even for you . - Look at her . - I have watched you pull a man 's eyes ... and make him dance like a marionette with his own optic nerves . - At least I didn 't break his heart . - You don 't know that . - Access granted . - We 're in , lover . Welcome . This is impossible . Funny face , this doesn 't look like the basement . That 's because it 's not ! Hello . Pick up everything you needed at the store , honey ? What are you doing here ? You were supposed to be our rescue team . What do you want from me ? You had super kill guy and you still got caught . You see , Dr. Venture , I found the piece your father hid in the foundation years ago . Then I thought about you in physics class . You were a daydreamer , a sass mouth , and not infrequently , a bit of a giggle puss . Somehow I doubt 20 years of amphetamines and failure ... have done anything to improve that . And you see , this invention ... is simply too important to trust to someone like yourself . Richard ? Where 's Rocket ? - Whom ? - Rocket ! Your son . - I can 't believe you ! - H.E.L.P. ER . Come in . H.E.L.P. ER . Now he 's bossing my robot around ! You see this ? - You have a radio in your collar ? - Of course ! What kind of an idiot ... would strap his only means of emergency communication to his wrist ? - They always tie you up . - Well , fancy schmancy ! H.E.L.P. ER , we need you to access ... the impossible security system and get us free . Hello ! Anyone ? OK , the Grand Galactic Inquisitor is coming out ! But you are to continue to ignore me ! OK ? All right ! I 'm taking that as a yes ! Hello ? Someone left a baby ! Ignore me ! Halt ! Identify yourself . How do you even know he 's mine ? ! The way you alley cat around ... with every washed-up scientist who blows through town . Three . Two . One . Engage . He 's out there somewhere ! You have to do something ! - Stop working on that and do something ! - Sally , please ! This is important . What could be more important than your family , Richard ? ! Science ? Of all the intolerable bug-a-boos ! Gentlemen , this is a family discussion . You have no idea who you 're dealing with , do you ? ! I am Professor Richard impossible ! I can do this ... No , no , no ! Holy crap ! Man overboard ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Wait . Limited seating . Good news , sample subjects of earth ! The glorious moment of judgment is upon you ! - Hey , it 's 8.20 on the meter , Stretch ! - Ignore me ! - Who the hell is that ? - Long story . Just ignore him . Papa ? Wait a minute . Where are you going ? - Where you can 't follow , Rusty . - Don 't go . There 's so much I want to ask you , so many unanswered questions . Like , what 's that big yellow thing in pop 's lab do ? And if you drop a penny from the Empire State Building ... does it go through your body or ... Quiet . I 'm trying to have a family moment here . Where have you been for the past 20 years ? ! Why haven 't you contacted me ? How can you just leave me all alone ? Rusty . You were never alone . Those stars ... Well , OK , you can 't see them right now because we 're in the city ... but those stars , they 're always watching us . - Wait ! Stay with us ! - Yes , please , stay . I 'm your other son . We 've never met . All right . Look , I 'm not really your father , OK ? I 'm an alien sent here at this appointed time to kill that guy ... because he would have destroyed all life as you know it . - What ? ! - I took the form of your dad ... because I figured it would be easier to accept . I didn 't want to stress you out . End of the world , life on other planets ... Why ... you ... son of a bitch ! Do you know what you just put me through ? ! What the ... were you thinking ? What kind of ... up planet are you from ... where you think showing up as my dead ... father ... is supposed to make me feel any better ? ! - OK , take it easy . - You prick ! Look , I just saved your entire planet . - Prick ! - All right . Fine . You wanna see ? Here ! There ! That would 've been better ? If I 'd shown up like that out of nowhere ? ! Look at you ! You practically crapped your pants . Except him . He crapped his pants ! We know what we 're doing up there , OK ? So don 't second guess me . Just get in your little plane , go back to your little lives ... and thank your lucky stars someone in this universe ... is looking out for you ! Ungrateful little half-monkeys ! - Bye . - Whatever . Great . So we haul ass all over the world , almost got ourselves killed ... and now , nothing to show for it . - Not even gas money . - We did kinda , like , save the world . - I guess . - And that big guy finally shut up . And we worked together , like a family . Go , Team Venture ! Life among the stars . Pretty amazing stuff , eh , Captain ? Yippers , boss . I 'm sorry . Rocket , no . He likes you . - Oh , I 'm sorry . - Sally impossible ! - Have we met before ? - Not that you know of . I 'm Jonas . Jonas Venture Jr . You can call me JJ ... If you like . I like . You can almost hear the old humpbacks a 'callin ' . Yep . We better get moving , Brock . You know how clingy old skull face over there can get . - And I likes my independence . - It 's pretty f 'd up , man . Don 't tell me you were sucked in by all that " You 're not alone " crap , too ? I 've seen some weird stuff in my life , but this ... Yeah . Should we help him ? That is bloody good soup !

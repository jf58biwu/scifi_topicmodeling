You just a clone . : Italian Subs Addicted : Theater Jomblo Revisi : siGantenG Forbidden Science Episode 6 Property Part 1 I was grown in a test tube . Labeled : 11738 . I was told my name was Stephanie White , and given lifetime memory so that I can replace someone 's dead wife . I was a product to be sold and bought . But I chose to be my own person instead . Person . I guess that sounds funny . You see ... I 'm a clone . I renamed myself Julia and worked beside those created me , believing I was their equal . Problem is , the creator and the creation are never really equal . Julia ! My name is 11738 . Hi , Max . Come on , baby . You know what I want . Come on , Max ! Come on , Max . You knpw what I like . Come on . Come on ! My God , you 're beautiful . Everything a man could desire in a woman . I want to spend my life pleasing you . That 's it , Max ! Oh , that 's it . That was amazing . As always . You can go now . Max , did you forget the coffee ? Max ? Let me guess . See no evil , cure no evil . You forgot to speak " no evil " . Oh , you mean like saying ... what the last the quarter sales figures ? Somewhat like that . As much I love to berad you on the fact that your report even remotely on time , it 'll have to wait . An emergency come up . Thank God . So , who died ? Funny you should ask . Joan , how are you ? I don 't understand , he was fine last night . Admiring your handy work ? Not ours . This is an extremly advance . He 's got quadrople processors , backup systema , even cognitive imprints , - memory storage ... - Can you fix him ? Not sure yet . It seems his circuit shut down internally . Never seen anything like it . You 're suggesting my andriod commited suicide ? Of course not . Andriods are not self aware that allowed suicidal . Anyway , I could try disconnecting the circuit boards to reboot , but I 'm gonna need the schematics . - If this isn 't our , who design it ? - 4ever Japanese branch . For this I have to come down , and coordinate the transfer . - Transfer ? - At the Japan . Whoever built it , make the repairs . Look , you can 't just ship Max to a foreign country . They 're our people . He 's been with me for over a year . He 's overheard private details , priviledge security calls , business deals ... I 'm US senator , for Christsake ! I can 't have my affairs broadcast ... - We will have the memory wiped . - No . I don 't want him to forget me . Get him fixed . Period . I 've grown attached . Are you forgetting our little arrangment ? We 'll make some phone calls , I 'll see if can get the schematics . Looks like the senator got our boss in a short leash . They used to be an item I think . - Really ? - What 's the matter ? - Jealous ? - You found me out . Hey , look at those . L5 ? As in Level 5 ? Maybe it got something to do with the great conspiracy you talking about several weeks ago . Before 6 come 5 . Glad to see those math class paying off . Colin said Level 6 was just a codename for government memory programm . But I don 't see how it can be connected to a pleasure model . You think this is all coincidence ? Or your overactive imagination . Should 've call me first , instead of just rushing here like some heart broken school girl . No one here knows about Max , or our ' arrangement ' , as you call it . You right . I apologize . Nothing I can 't fix . I wasn 't aware you 're back in town . Congress is in recess . I just came back for a couple weeks of fund raiser . Well , if you need a donation , all you need to do is ask . As I recalled ... Your support always came in hefting price . Anything worth acquiring ... usually does . Hey , Julia . What are you doing down here ? I understand you having problems with this higher functions . I thought I might be of some help . No offense , but your work on the brain patterns . Maxs isn 't exactly biologic . The circuits sure appears look alot like human brain . Looks to me it 's like ... somehow it 's been rerouted . Like he 's growing new inputs . Like memory nodes . Yeah , or maybe it 's like the Rorschach test . You see what you want to see . - What 's his name ? - Max . I know . Terrible . I would have gone with Luther , or something more ' herculean ' . Well , not my pleasure bot . Do you think he knows we 're here ? Are you alright ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . It 's just ... Isn 't kind of this how I look when you ... created me . Completely different . You have breasts . Ok , bad joke . Look , you 're a person , he 's not . I 'm a clone . He 's an android . Neither of us are really human . Feel that ? It 's a heartbeat . He doesn 't have one . You 're flesh and blood . You can think , reason , have children , grow old , even die . Max will never be more than he was meant to be . Really hot vibrator . Neural Activity Detected It must be just an electrical spike . I 'll let you to get back to your work . Julia ! I was just kidding about the vibrator . Really gotta to working on cencoring myself . It 's been a while . How do I compare to Max ? - You really want to know ? - Ok , forget I asked . I 'm kidding . You 're wonderful . Nothing beats the real thing . Although he 's the best bone as any can stich when ever he meet me . I can 't believe you 're not more carefull about what I heard . Max is the only connnection between you and me . I kept my end of the bargain . No oversight , no committies , no interference . You worry too much . If anyone looks into your affairs its gonna go through my desk first . It 's me . Thre 's a possibility that an android have more information than you 're originally thought Hi . Remember me ? They just left you down here in the dark , huh ? Sorry about that . My name is Julia . Can you hear me ? I 'd like to try to help you . I guess I thought ... I hoped ... it hurt me earlier . I 'm like you . Sort of . Not quite sure where I belong . Anyway ... I just want you to know you 're not alone . What are you doing ? Not ... alone ... Whatever she used to download it seems somehow jump start his motors abilities . On top of that , I think Julia might be right about the higher functions . They seems to be like growing , or something . What do you mean growing ? I mean his dormant circuits or backup memory , are no longer dormant . I 've never see this before . Could it be from the download ? I guess its possible . I try to tell her the security was still doing a sweep . - It 's alright . - What the hell is going on ? It seems someone broke in here and try to download Max 's memory banks . But not sure how much they got . - What ? Why ? - I was hoping you can tell me . Oh , you think I had something to do with his ? No . But someone went alot of troble to find out what your friend knows . By essential , what you know . Max ? Max , it 's me . Joan . - What is wrong with him ? - Can I talk to you for a minute ? Look . Joan , we have to be realistic here . Either they after you od they after me , either way Max is an unneccesary risk . What are you talking about ? The only got part of the data , they bound to try again . So what you 're saying is ... I see . You 're right . Yes . Do what we have to . You wanted to see me ? Oh yes . Do you have those schematics ? Not yet . I tried to call you earlier but ... you seem busy with the senator . - It 's that a problem ? - What do you mean ? Well , let 's just say you sounded ... Forget it . Anyway ... Don 't worry about schematics . we won 't be needing them . Unfortunately the client has decided to shut Max down . Politician has alot of secrets to protect . Any chance she 's protecting any of your secrets ? Our secrets , Bethany . I 've been thinking about making you senior VP . Come again ? Why so surprise ? I 'm up to my years . I could use the help . You 're intellegent . Good with clients , and ... Rarely believe you and question on practically anything you say . Sound like the perfect vice-president . If I want someone who never question me I 'd hire Max . Well thanks , but I 'm still settling in the job I have now . Well , not offering it today , I just want to mention it . Besides , I have no secrets from the senior vice-president . Everything you wanted to know , I 'm giving answers to you , including the elussive Level 6 , will be aviable to you . I 'll think about it . You sure about this , sir ? It 's an awful risk . She bound to discover the truth about Level 6 eventually . Better if she find it our way than hers . Besides , haven 't you ever heard the phrase " The truth will set you free " ? Yes , but not yet . No , first she has to trust you . You were looking for me ? Yes . Julia , ehm ... Listen , let 's talk . What 's wrong ? I just got a text from Colin . He wants me to deactivate Max . - What ? - He wants me to disassamble them . To find out what 's going on with the higher function . Why it shut down in the first place . But to do that , I have to take him apart piece by piece . You can 't ! I 'm sorry . I know you like him but ... But what exactly ? You can 't just kill him ! Julia , it isn 't killing , he 's not alive , he 's ... Like you ? Human ? - I 'm really sorry . - Yeah , you already said that . You look scared . What happen to you , Max ? Why did you shut down ? Internal failure . What that 's mean ecxatly ? I have a malfunction that can 't be self repaired . Malfunction ? I have 1.3 years of memory storage during my time with the senator . In that period I carried out my ... Duties . Until I no longer wish to . That 's not a failure , Max . - It 's a choice . - I 'm not programmed for choice . - I do not wish it . - But you chose to shut down ! That was different . I have memories too . A life time worth , but ... only six months of them are actually mine . The rest belong to someone else . Everytime I turn left I wondered if I should have gone right . Because I don 't know if I making a decison based on what I want or what Stephanie would have . But I 'm more than my downloaded memory say than I am , just as you 're more than your programming . I never wanted to be more than I am . But you are ! And now you have to make a choice . They are going to deactivate you permanently . Why ? Android would never ask that , would it ? I guess you have to choose . Do you go left ... or right ? What are you doing ? I 'm making the choice . We got a problem . - Now what ? - Max is gone . - How did he ... ? - I think Julia took him . What ? Why would she steal an android ? She 's been actiong weird since Max got here , I ... I don 't know , she seem to think they 're kinderent spirits or something . Wonderful . - Get me security . - What are you doing ? - What does it look like ? - She 's our friend . Yes , she is . And what do you think will happen to her if the senator finds her or whoever it was that broke in here the other night ? - Colin ? - I 'll deal with Colin . This is Bethany Montrose . We have security breach . Shut down all exits . Back off . Food 's mine . You don 't eat , remember ? Now these ... are for you ! I didn 't know your size , so ... I went extra large with everything . What do you do now Julia ? Not bad , huh ? Anyone care to tell me how one of our scientist just walk out the door with a half billion dollar andriod ? It appear she hid the android in a reclamation bin and went through the garage . Two nights ago , somebody breaks into the lab . And the next night somebody break out of it ? What the hell I 'm paying you people for ? Security shows her exited at 1 AM . That give us an 8 and half hour lead . - Should I notify the authorities ? - No . This is internal matters . Have to try - to track her cellphone ? - She left it here . Smart girl . Smarter than you at least . Now get the hell out of my face . She 's your friend . Fix this before I inform the senator . Anything ? Every clone and android 4ever manufactured has an locator tracker imbeded in it 's neck . I removed Julia 's months ago , but ... There . There he is . Max ? Do you feel pain ? I feel everything you feel . Then I 'm sorry . Look for down here . Over here . The tracker . She 's gone . : Italian Subs Addicted :

 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... I 'm thinking I love you . Always remember that . You wanna stop Skynet ? This is the way . Eight years . I didn 't wanna leave you . I didn 't have a choice . - You married ? - Yeah . I am . When we jumped through time , you told me I died of cancer . Yes . 2005 . - Am I still gonna get sick ? - I don 't know . She 's bleeding out ! There 's a warehouse in the desert . Mom , everybody who knew anything about the factory is already dead . Well , I 'm not . And Kaliba was building something . Hey , baby . You were pregnant . Now you aren 't . - You care about this girl ? - Yeah . She 's a security risk . - What are you doing ? - Moving . Yeah . Well , seems about the right time for that . When John was a child , the legends of the jungle were his fairytales . His favorite was the story of El Viejo Del Monte . The old man of the forest ... A merciless hunter who killed every animal in his path . El Viejo didn 't bother to eat his prey . He left it behind to rot in the soil . To teach him a lesson , the gods turned him into a simisco , half-animal , half-man . He was condemned to defend the jungle for all eternity . Mom . Mom ! This was El Viejo 's punishment . This was his curse ... To forever be vigilant , to forever protect . Look . We have to keep moving . Why are we so far from camp ? Told you . It 's part of the game . You mean training . Well , if we call it a game , it 's more fun . But it 's not a game . The point ... is listen to me . I always listen . You don 't talk that much . We gotta go . How long will it take you to pack up the storage locker ? A while . Some explosives that need securing . Make sure you get to the safe house before night . If you haven 't been there before , it can be hard to find . I can follow directions . Well , you can also make mistakes . Wouldn 't want anyone else getting hurt because of them . 33-42-31 north . The safe house coordinates . It 's in the desert . You like the desert . Things happen out there . Things happen here too . We 're starting over . Whatever happened here ... is no one 's fault . Let 's get outta here . Hello , Savannah . How are you today ? I 'm well . Would you like to play a game ? Engaging in imaginative play helps my development . This is Mount Valmai , hiding place of the mask of life . The Toa protect the mask from the dark hunters . These are the ducklings ... Chickie , Pluffy , and Feathers . Can they play too ? I don 't think there are any ducklings on the mystical island of Voya Nui . Are you sure ? I 'm sorry . I 've accessed all the files . I can find no references to them in any of the instructions . What 's wrong ? Would you like one of the Toa instead ? No . The ducklings are sad because they can 't play . Can 't you change the rules to make them happy ? Yes . We can change the rules . - What ... is ... - Ouch ! John Henry , stop ! - All ... this ... about ? - Let go ! Please ! John Henry , please ! You 're hurting me ! Ouch ! John Henry ! - I ... understand ... - Stop ! Let go ! - What ... this ... is ... about . - No ! Please ! Stop it ! S02E20 : To The Lighthouse Static . It 's weird . Must be interference or something . What the hell ? Bug slug . Bug slug ? Are you serious ? We just passed it . We haven 't played bug slug since I was , like , eight . You can 't just start playing without telling me . Fine . We 're playing bug slug . What if I don 't wanna play ? Too late . Already started . Do you feel all right ? I feel great . You feel great . Why ? We haven 't been on the road together for a long time . That 's all . What 's so great about it ? Hey , just don 't teach bug slug to Cameron . She could do some real damage . God , this signal really blows . Hey , desert 's that way . We 're taking a detour . So ... I 've got good news , I 've got bad news , and I have really bad news . The good news is what we 've got here isn 't an engineering problem . All of John Henry 's processes look okay . Daemons are running fine . Wait a minute . His ' demons ' ? Oh , you ... uh ... yeah . His daemons ... D-a-e-m-o-n . It 's a tech term for a program that runs in the background . All computers like John Henry have them . Daemons run the lights , daemons manage the elevators , the security systems ... all kinds of daemons everywhere . Okay . So what caused John Henry 's deamons to go crazy ? That 's the bad news . Came from the outside . Cyber attack ? Which brings me to the really bad news . And by bad news I mean on a scale of one to ten , one being a hangnail , ten being Katrina , this is Katrina with a hangnail . Looks like someone managed to stuff malware down the throat of the most sophisticated AI in human history . John Henry was infiltrated . Probed . Well ... looks worse than that to me . It looks like someone out there wants to kill him . You 've been into my plastic ? I needed it . You know what , I can handle the rest myself . Sarah sent both of us here . Yeah . - Get John away from you . - Or from you . Don 't touch this . We 're supposed to get everything . I 've got this . That jacket belongs to Jesse . Don 't talk about her , okay ? You don 't know anything about her . I know that you loved her . You wouldn 't have fathered a child with her if you didn 't . I 'm sorry for your loss . What ? I 'm sorry for your loss . What loss ? The child you fathered with Jesse . The one she was carrying aboard the S.S. Jimmy Carter . The one that died . I never had a kid . You can 't kill me . I can try . Tell me what you 're talking about . She was pregnant . She miscarried . Why 'd you tell me that now ? You put John in danger when you lied about Jesse . Sarah nearly lost her child . You 've lost a child . You won 't make that mistake again . You knew her . I met her once . She never told me that . It seems she never told you a lot of things . What is this place ? Hey ! Hey , come here . What are you doing here , huh ? Who lives here ? Come on . Charley . Hey , Johnny . Hey . You like bouillabaisse ? I ... may , I don 't know . What is it ? It 's French for fish soup . Mm . That 's very good . Yeah ? The secret 's the fresh tomatoes . I grow ' em myself . You grow tomatos ? Yeah . Think that 's funny ? Don 't you ? I got a lotta time on my hands , you know ? Might as well put it to good use . She 's been here before . Not with me . She set this house up after Michelle died . Hey , want more soup ? - Yeah . - Sure . All right . She tell you why we 're here ? No , she didn 't . Spare room 's in there . We 're spending the night ? What about Derek and Cameron ? We 'll meet up with them tomorrow . Hey ! I could use a hand on the boat . I 've got some work to do , hmm ? Uh , yeah . Let me get my gear . Smells good . There 's bread in the fridge . There 's peanut butter . Help yourself . Charley ... I won 't be here long . No . No , you won 't . So she was from the future , and you knew ... The whole time ? Not the whole time . I suspected something , but ... Just took me a while to figure it out . You love her ? She was a good person . I don 't know . Maybe if things were different- - Yeah , well , I guess you could say that ... About a lotta things . I could say that about my whole damn life . But it 's not , so what 's the point ? That first week ... I kept seeing her . I 'd go to the market , she 'd be there . And for a second , my heart would stop . And then I 'd realize , hey , that 's ... That 's not my wife . That 's just some random woman who wears her hair the way Michelle used to . For a while , I stopped shopping there . But a man can only live on convenience store burritos for so long . So ... I go back there now . It 's getting better . What kind of explosives did you rig the beach with ? Semtex . Radio detonators ? Hard-wired switch mounted under the dock . When the perimeter 's breached , a siren goes off . I figure I got about 60 seconds to escape by boat . Boat can 't stop bullets . Even if they sink it , I got a chance . Those bastards can 't swim . I can . Cromartie . A hell of a day , huh ? Hey , got more work to do . All right . You remember Hal Beesley ? The old guy from the diner ? Nebraska ? Yeah . What about him ? He was my best customer . Came in for every meal . Three times a day like clockwork ... breakfast , lunch , and dinner . Hmm . He tipped me like crazy . It was that waitress uniform . It 's like catnip . One day John got sick . I didn 't know what was wrong with him . I had no savings , no insurance . Hal pulled out a wad of bills ... gave it to me to take John to the doctor . He said as long as I needed help , he 'd be there . No strings attached . That 's a man with a dream . He was a widower . Lost his wife of 40 years . Knew what it was like to be alone . Said that I could count on him for anything anytime . And one day , he came in and said I didn 't need him anymore ... Said that I 'd found someone I could depend on ... Someone I could trust . Someone who would never , ever let me down . I got nothin ' ... Sarah . I got nothing ... left to give you . Not for me . John . John ? He seems like he 's pretty full up with people taking care of him . I don 't trust any of them . Yeah , well ... He 's still got you , right ? Give me . Oh , Sarah ... How long ? I don 't know . I found it a few days ago . Are you sure it 's ... I think so . How do you know ? Cameron said when we jumped eight years through time , we jumped over my death . From cancer ? - If-If you jumped over it , then ... - It doesn 't mean I don 't ... Still get it , Charley . It doesn 't mean it 's not in me . And sometimes I think that the things I 've done , maybe I 've sped up the date . - It 's my fate , Charley . - No . Come here . It 's my fate . There 's nothing I can do . Wish I could tell ya I found every hole and patched it , but no such thing as perfect security . Perfect , no . But is it sufficient ? The damn thing is tricky . Can 't know for sure , not really . - Who would know ? - He would . John Henry was fooled before . Yeah . You don 't fool John Henry twice . Activate the AI . But don 't give it access to the outside world just yet . What is it , Mr. Murch ? It 's just ... no one 's ever done this with an AI this sophisticated before . - Any of what ? - Any of this . No one 's ever created an AI this sophisticated before , have they , Mr. Murch ? Point taken . Activate John Henry . No outside network . John Henry . John Henry , can you understand me ? The system seems solid . Should be good . John Henry . Hey , you 're making pancakes . Yours , I hope . No such luck . Am I interrupting something ? - No . - No . Hey , what are you doing ? You stole his seat . I took his seat ? You want some food ? Who loves you , huh ? Who loves you ? You 're not hungry ? Thank you . Maple or boysenberry ? Maple . I thought something like that might happen . Like what ? Explain , Mr. Murch , quickly . The on / off problem . Once it 's off , no problem . The act of turning it off ... Quicker . John Henry processes more information in a minute than we do in a lifetime . Millisecond for a supercomputer like this , it 's almost like forever to us . So when you turn it off ... It feels itself power down in that instant . It experiences that moment the way we might experience ... years . It feels itself die . Slowly . Very slowly . We have to hook it up to the net ... now . Is that safe ? We 're starving it . It 's bad enough that we let it die for like forever . Look , John Henry 's been living off the most insane amount of data for weeks now . It 's his world . And we took it away . Fix it . Wait . We should talk about this . Ms. Weaver . In for a penny , in for a pound , James . John Henry . I know what it feels like , Mr Ellison . What ? To die . Then come back . To be alone . We had to cut you off from your network . It was for your own good . There is another . Another what ? One like me . Another one like me . You didn 't tell Derek and Cameron we were coming here , did you ? They wouldn 't understand . They know about this place ? No . I don 't trust them anymore . Neither should you . Derek made a mistake , Mom . It was a human mistake . He could have gotten you killed . Well , he didn 't . Chose himself over you . Yeah , because he loved her . Lot of that going around these days . Is that a bad thing ? I 'm not here for Charley . Okay , then why are we here ? We 're here for you . People matter , John . They 're all that matters . Don 't ever forget that . John ! John ! I won . I was alone , and you couldn 't find me . That 's the game , right ? You won . You won . When did you find the lump ? Few days ago . Any unexplained weight loss , fevers , night sweats ? I 've been feeling nauseated , but I thought that was just stress . Work ? Yeah , work . You can lie back . Obviously there is a mass inside your breast . Whether it 's cancer or not remains to be seen . The ultrasound will show us the lump size and exactly where it lies inside the breast tissue . - All set , doctor . - Thank you . Now , to determine the nature of the lump , you 're gonna need a biopsy . Now open up your gown , please . It 's gonna be cold . - Did you have surgery recently ? - No . An implant removed ? No . What is it ? What do you see ? Well ... the good news is the lump inside your breast isn 't a tumor . Then , what is it ? It 's a ... a cystic mass . It 's not that unusual . Great . That 's great . But what is unusual is what the cyst has formed around . It 's a ... a piece of metal . A tiny wire . Metal ? You don 't know how it got in there ? You work for Kaliba . It 's a transmitter . And piece it in the back . Will this kill me ? What ? I said , will this kill me ? You 're gonna use that on yourself ? It 's a transmitter . Current should short it out . But if it 's gonna kill me , it 's self-defeating . It isn 't gonna kill you , but it 's gonna hurt like hell . You have to leave . You did the right thing by telling me . Thank you . Fix the tire . I 'll check it out . Mom ? Mom ! I 've traced the roving back door that allowed access to my systems . It uploaded itself from one of the main T3 hubs that carry all global internet traffic . It uploaded itself . Yes , Mr. Ellison . It is highly sophisticated . The intelligence who designed it is far beyond you or Mr. Murch or any human being . It 's very interesting . The back door allowed the insertion of a worm program . The worm is merely code , a means by which the intelligence can invade and operate my systems remotely . Like hands and fingers . I calculate that the worm is now present in a significant percentage of the world 's computer systems . The Intelligence uses them . For what ? It has been looking for me . Why ? I share a common code base with the worm and therefore , the Intelligence . I believe we are brothers . Explain . How 's this possible ? I found useful information in the code comments , this picture , in ASCII text , and the name of the original programmer . Miles Dyson . Miles Dyson died in 1997 in an explosion at CyberDyne systems , The apparent victim of Sarah Connor , a known terrorist who had escaped from Pescadero State mental hospital , days before the incident . That was your case , Mr. Ellison , when you were at the FBI . Yes . Yes , it was my case . You never found Sarah Connor . No . I never did . John Henry , this Intelligence ... Your brother ... what does it want ? He wants what we all want , Ms. Weaver . To survive . It 's down . Okay . I need to know what to do next . Show me where to cut . Right side of the head . Got it . Where 'd you get this diagram ? Your brother ? You don 't say . You 're welcome . Why 'd you come after me ? You know the location of the safe house . John 's location . - If they tortured you- - - That would never happen . It has before . Transcript : Yyets.net

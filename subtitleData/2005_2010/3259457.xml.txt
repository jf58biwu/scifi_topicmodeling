 New York city . " Beautiful catastrophe , " as someone once called it . I call it home . Romance . Glamour . Excitement . This city has it all . When you 've lived here as long as I have , you 've seen what I 've seen , cynicism isn 't just a pose . It 's what gets you through the day . And I 've had a lot of days . And a lot of nights . The opening step , el paseo , the stroll . So who are you , John ? I hardly know anything about you . Ask me anything you want . Does a cop learn how to dance the tango ? Detective . Oh . Detective . A milonga in Buenos Aires . The abrazo , the embrace . Some of us came here for love . Some for treasure . Most of us came for a new beginning , and brought our old ways with us . No ! We don 't kill women . Get out of the way ! Life was cheap in New Amsterdam . It still is . And homicide , I 've seen people kill for a pair of shoes . Omar ? Hey , 36 . What happened ? Problems with your bookie ? I fell . Again ? Looks like you were pushed . There was a slight disagreement over funds . I 'll cover it . I 'll build something . A desk . Hey , I owe you that much . I remember when thelonious monk bought one of your desks . Ah , 1957 , after the midnight show at five spot , with Coltrane sitting here . Coltrane died mad at me . You deserved it . Poker or mets ? Damn mets ! Omar , you never learn . * there 's an island hidden in the sound * * lapping currents lay your boat to ground * * fix your barb and bayonets * * the curve is carved there arabesque * * and sorrow fills- - * I 've watched the world change . Best invention- - indoor plumbing . Worst invention- - the alarm clock . Hi . My name is John , and I 'm an alcoholic . Hi , John . I haven 't had a drink in 15,495 days . Hey , guy , do you think that 's funny ? I can do the math . You 'd have to have been sober since 1965 . I look young for my age . * you come and see * * come and see * The more things change ... The more they stay the same . can CSU get in there ? Do you know who she is ? No id . Nice body . Could be a pros . Unlikely . Well , four were killed in this area in the last year . Smell that perfume ? Heliotrope . Pick that up from Cosmo ? Sarah Bernhardt . She that lesbian comic ? How come I 'm not shocked ? Actress , turn of the century . Was her favorite scent . What does that have to do with the price of tea in Shanghai ? Heliotrope , 250 an ounce . Not what your typical working girl wears around here . I 'm detective Eva Marquez . We 're gonna be working together . Are we ? That 's what the lieutenant says . Marquez ? You Eddie Marquez 's kid ? I worked with him in the 4-4 . He 's a real putz . Worked with your brother in bronx narcotics a couple of years ago . He 's a putz , too . Hope it 's not genetic . As a matter of fact , it is . You deserve each other . So what do we got on this ? Dead girl . We try to find out who did it . Funny . Does she have a name ? I guess not . When I got this assignment , I asked around about you . You know what I heard ? Make sure your insurance is paid up . Dust this . Right away . No sign of forced entry . Could be someone she knew . Neighbors hear or see anything ? No , everybody 's deaf , dumb and blind . I 'll go talk to ' em . Look , detective whatever-your-name-is , here 's the way it goes : first week , you make an effort . Second week , you hate my guts . Third week , you put in for a transfer . So why don 't you just save yourself some time- - and miss the foreplay ? No way . My name is Eva . Marquez . · ­ Òë : fairyyoung . kangkangpig . ÌÓÌÓ. szczerbiak55 ...

Don 't do this , man . - I don 't want to have to shoot you . - Then don 't . It hurts like hell . I didn 't kill her , ok ? Yeah ? Where 'd the blood come from ? What 's her name , Eddie ? Get on the ground , now ! I know how to use this thing . Last time I was shot , it was with a Hopkins and Allen , xl number 6 pocket . Now , get on the ground ! Now , those days , bullets didn 't have copper jackets , so it was like pouring hot water through your veins . Are you crazy ? I 'm a doctor . He 's still asystole . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . One more time . Ok , clear . What you done to me ? You will not grow old . You will not die ... Until you find the one , and your souls are wed . Ok . Let 's call it . What 's the time ? Trust me- - all of it gets old . Except me . How long have we known each other ? Long enough to know better . You know the answer . Why do you ask me that ? Do I look different to you ? You could use a shave . Look closer . You look , uh ... Happy . I almost died . Hey , let the good times roll . My heart exploded chasing some guy on the subway . But that can 't happen , not to you . There 's always a first time . Oh , boy . I think she was there . Who ? The one . The one who 'll make me old like you . I never did like that idea . You meet your true love and then die . Doesn 't sound too romantic to me . How do you know she was there ? Well , the shaman told me I 'd feel it here , in my heart . Well , maybe the shaman was wrong . Maybe it was just last night 's chinese . You don 't know . It ain 't exactly science . This was like nothing I 've ever felt ! Look , you just had a heart attack and didn 't die . Now , I thought when you met the right one , you were supposed to become mortal- - only after our souls are united . What the hell does that mean ? After you kissed her , after you slept with her ? After you 've done Lamaze class they didn 't give an instruction manual , ok ? I didn 't exactly meet her . I was too busy trying to breathe . So you don 't even know who she is . I know she was there . I know she exists . That 's enough . Not for you . You 're gonna try to find her . And when you don 't find her , you 're gonna get crazy . And last time you got crazy , it was a long damn 10 years . Omar ... I know this is hard for you . No , I 'm happy for you , man . Inside , I 'm doing the camel walk . But this is a good thing . I 've been waiting centuries for this . If I can find her , it 'll all have value . Time ... Will have value . Oh , Dr. Dillane . Hey , uh , we have a problem ? We , or you ? Remember that M.I. you brought in yesterday ? Yeah . The one with the scars . Did you ever get his name ? No , but that 's not it . Um , he 's disappeared . He was dead . Yeah , I know . Like I said , we have a problem . You 're in my chair . Probably because I 'm sitting at your desk . I can see we already progressed to the next stage of our relationship . I don 't hate you , Amsterdam . That would take too much effort . Good . Today 's a whole new day . Missing persons ? Fingerprints , crime scene reports . It 's called police work . Someone needs to do it . She 's not a missing person . How do you know that ? Her boyfriend told me . We had a little heart to heart in the subway . His name 's eddie riley . Yeah , he 's a primary subject . When 'd you bring him in ? I didn 't . He give you her name ? He had a train to catch . Look , don 't be cute . She deserves better . Yeah , you 're absolutely right . Where you going ? Police work . Someone needs to do it . Look , we need to set some ground rules here . You sound just like my last 609 girlfriends . I hate that smell . If dead bodies make you queasy , what are you doing in homicide ? Wasn 't my choice . I wanted to work undercover narcotics , but the powers that be refused my application . And dead bodies don 't make me queasy . I just can 't stand the smell of formaldehyde , ok ? Does she have a name ? Yeah , we just don 't know it . Well , the bullet perforated the right brachio-cophalic vein and the internal uhoracic ! What caliber ? Maybe a.38 , close range . She has some random contusions , defensive marks . I also found what looks like paint underneath her fingernails . Sent it over to the lab . See if it matches anything over at the S.O.C. Any chance the body was moved ? Lividity is inconclusive . I 'm sorry . I have a new baby . You need a deep male voice . Try putting on npr at 10 : 00 . Cool . Baby sleeps , and brushes up on foreign affairs . I like that . Then there 's this . The Penmar . An underground club . You knew about this how ? It used to be a speakeasy during prohibition . Same name , same spot . NYPD . We 're trying to id a young woman . She had the club stamp on her wrist . Lots of girls come in here . Any that look like this ? Whoa ... What happened to her ? That 's what we want to know . Hold on a sec . You knew about this being a speakeasy , how ? I used to drink here . I think your dead girl is like some wannabe celebutant . Chloe Carlton . She 's the one . In all of time , there is only one person you were meant to be with . We feel this . We know it . But we do not know how to find the one . What was so important ? The ( pool ) is supposed to be closed . It is . And you 're naked . Right again . Surveillance from Chloe 's bank . She withdrew 10k from her account the morning she was murdered . That 's the guy I chased . Eddie Riley . Santori 's put a warrant out on him . She also deposited a check for the same amount from a pawn broker 6 days ago . Only question is ... What is she selling ? Great thing about New York - - pawn shops are open all night . Why narcotics ? Most cops would kill to get into homicide . It 's after the fact . Digging through the past isn 't going to bring anyone back . I 'd rather be on the front lines . Why homicide ? I like to solve puzzles . And it intrigues me . What does ? Death . Likes to play hard to get . I 'll see you tomorrow . You have a good energy about you , Eva . It 's true . I felt I should say something nice . So there it is . Best yankee pitcher in history , guidry . Gossage , the goose . Guidry won a cy young award . 25 and 3 in ' 78 . Red ruffing . What do you know about it ? I know his curve ball dropped like it fell off a table . All you could do is wave at it . Hey , lone ranger , you know that guy you let get away ? Eddie Riley ? Before he went into the army , he was no stranger to the system . G.L.A. , burglary , assault . Not murder . You want to up your clearance rate until we nail the right guy . If they 're innocent , they don 't run . Riley 's our boy . And when I find him , he won 't get away . He 's right , you know . All signs point to Eddie . He could have shot me . He didn 't . I saw it in his eyes , he 's not a killer . What 'd you find ? Pawn shop keeps a photo log . This is what Chloe sold , vintage , deco-style , platinum and diamonds . Bezel and bead-set stones . Could be 4.5 carats . You learn that from one of your 609 girlfriends ? One of my wives . Plural . How many have you had ? Only one at a time . No way Eddie gave her this . I 'd like to know who did . Hello ? Mrs. Carlton ? I 'm detective Amsterdam , this is detective Marquez . We 're sorry about your loss . Get out . Please . We know how hard this must be for you . You know nothing . You 're a child . I have work to do . We need your help , mrs . Carlton . We need it now , because I 'm not letting whoever did this walk away . Will that bring her back ? She was my heart . You have no idea what I 'm feeling . It 's just words until it 's happened to you . He was 6 , my son . Well , almost 6 . It 's pain without end . Do you know who gave Chloe this bracelet ? She ran with a rich crowd . Dated Toby Hardwick for a while . Hardwick . As in Hardwick hotels ? Never liked him much . A rich boy through and through . Broke up a couple months ago . Any idea why ? She 'd met someone new . Eddie Riley . She said they had something real . And now she 's gone . How do I go on ? Thanks . Right here . Mr. Hardwick ? Excuse me a moment . Hi , you must be detectives ... Amsterdam and Marquez . Pleasure . Let 's step over here for a moment . Thanks for coming out here . We have preliminary inspections all week . Another hotel ? Low-cost housing for 300 families . With dreams comes responsibilities . So , how can I help you ? Chloe was a good friend of our family . We haven 't been able to contact your son . Toby ? He 's on a skiing trip . He 'll be back for the funeral . How long has he been gone ? A couple of days . Why ? He 's not a ... suspect , is he ? What can you tell us about your son 's relationship with Chloe ? They went out for a while . Nothing very serious , I don 't think . Who would have given her a $ 10,000 diamond bracelet ? I don 't know . That 's a lot of money . I suppose my son is very spoiled , my fault . We work to give them everything , and then they don 't know what to do with it . Look , Toby may be many things , some of them not very attractive , but he is not a killer . Madagascar red , manufactured in Italy until the 1940s . This is what was found under the victim 's fingernails . Artist-grade paint , banned for its toxic lead content . But what 's revealing is the medium used . The artist added water-washed linseed oil laced with gold leaf . Gold leaf ? It was a marker . An artist 's unique signature . Can you date it ? Based on the molecular deterioration , I would say 1930s . So if Chloe scratched a painting before she died , then she probably wasn 't killed at Eddie 's . No madagascar red there . That means the body was moved , maybe by Eddie . Or someone who wanted to frame him . That painting could be anywhere . It 's gonna be a very cold trail . Not if you know the painter . My mother seldom worked on canvass . She was more known for her onsite murals . She painted them all over New York - private homes , hotels , libraries . They called her one of the first graffiti artists . The paint really does shimmer . That is what made her work unique , she mixed it with gold . Did she keep any records ? She was an artist , not a bookkeeper . But you could try asking her . I thought your mother passed away . No , she 's still here . Sometimes , that is . The alzheimer 's plays havoc . Hello , Julianne . I wanted to ask you about your work . You 've seen it . Oh , many times . You used a pigment called madagascar red . Did i ? I remember alizarin crimson , such a lovely color . What about madagascar red ? It 's--it 's so long ago . It might have been for a special commission . Please , Julianne . It 's important . Yes . For the lover 's sacrifice . I painted that mural , you know . I know , I know . Where did you paint it , Julianne ? They won 't let me take walks anymore . They ... They 're worried I 'll forget my way home . Sometimes it 's better to forget . But you remember your work , don 't you ? Do I know you ? Not anymore . She painted the mural in the presidential suite of the Davenshire hotel . The Davenshire ? Sold in the eighties to Hardwick hotels . Toby Hardwick had access , but motive ? We need evidence . We have to get into that suite . I 'll get a warrant . You think I wouldn 't remember you ? - You think I wouldn 't remember what we had ? - I 'm so sorry . This happens sometimes . It 's ok . Let her be . One day you left . You just left . I gave up so much for you . Didn 't I mean anything ? The thing of it is , I knew you were going to leave me . I knew it the first day we met . Ever ask yourself why a vampire has no reflection in a mirror ? Not this week . It 'd be too painful . To see himself year after year , century after century , unchanged while everything around him grows old . To search for love but know it 's always just out of your reach . Because to be human is to die . To die is what makes life worth living . It 's god 's joke . What about the girl in the subway ? There were probably a couple hundred women on that platform . Maybe she was the one , maybe not . Maybe she was on her way to the airport and is long gone . It 's all maybes . Maybe it 's a sign that I 'll never find her . Your desk is done . Newly painted . The killer 's standing here . There 's a struggle , he hits her , she falls against the wall here . Shouldn 't we wait for crime scene ? Absolutely . Got the blood work back on your disappearing corpse , and it 's a mess . No , this must be a lab error . These numbers don 't make sense . I mean , the hemoglobin level 's over the moon . 120 micros of lead ? That 's enough to kill someone . Yeah , and check out the blood type . It 's this rare form of RZRZ . It became extinct when certain native American tribes disappeared . So , somebody 's pulling our chain ? Hope so . Ok , but how did Toby remove the body ? I mean , there must be security cameras everywhere . You know ... This guy kind of looks like you . You think ? What the hell ? It was common for turn of the century hotels to build secret entrances to their best suite . Toby could have known about this . Took a chance . That 's years of bad luck . Only 7 . Let 's bring him in . - No ! - Ok . Ok , there 's no way I reserved that room . You 're name 's on the register , you 've partied there before . - Come on , Toby ! - I don 't care , I wasn 't there . There 's no way that you can prove that I was . That 's enough . Counselor . Mr. Hardwick is my client . I suggest that if you intend to charge him , you do so . Otherwise he 's leaving with me . I don 't need someone to talk for me . I 'm not 5 years old . Be quiet , Toby . Look , there 's no way I could have killed Chloe . She 's my friend . You were jealous because she met someone else . Yes , I love her , but not like that . Well , then how ? You don 't strike me as the platonic type . My father 's here , isn 't he ? Is he--is he watching ? Toby . Toby . What if I could prove that I wasn 't at the hotel that night ? You don 't need to say anything . I 'm in love with someone else . I was with that person the night that Chloe was killed . Yeah ? We need her name . I can 't do that . You can if it 's true . Ok . His name is Brian Shaw . I guess we all have secrets . That 's what keeps us in business . What do you think his father 's saying to him ? He 's telling him he loves him . Aw , a romantic . I can read lips . And you 're also deaf , I suppose . It was temporary . Normandy . A shell exploded too close to comfort . Sorry I asked . Talked to Toby Hardwick 's boyfriend and verified his alibi . I told you , Eddie Riley 's our guy . Don 't take it too hard , hotshot . Even Red Ruffing lost a few . I just got word from McManus . He found Eddie at the Penmar . Turns out his brother-in-law runs the place . He 's been hiding out there . Santori 's on his way to pick him up . Get in . What happened ? Tried to run . Guess he thought if it worked once , it 'd work again . It didn 't . He 'll be all right . Found this on him - - a .38 . Nice work , Tony . Brought this one home . I 've been doing this a long time . You got good instincts , John , but sometimes things are what they seem . Thanks . That 's a good lesson . You didn 't buy a word of that . Not true . He said I have good instincts . What do your instincts tell you now ? Same as before . Eddie didn 't kill that girl . But if he 's innocent , why did he run ? Why didn 't he give himself up ? He comes home , finds Chloe 's body . He tries to save her , gets blood all over him . The cops show up . He knows what it 'll look like . He has a record , body 's in his place . Now , who 's gonna believe him ? So he picks up the gun and runs . Then who did it ? The only other person with access to the suite , the only person who would have known about the secret entrance . Peter Hardwick ? Interesting theory , but it would help to have a motive . It 's more than a theory . Hardwick was having an affair with Chloe . How do you know that ? His son implicated him . When ? I was there , I didn 't hear him say that . I didn 't say I heard him . I 'm not sure lip reading 's exactly admissible . Hey , Eddie . You 're the dude who chased me . I thought you were dead . I was . Now I 'm not . Lucky me . I don 't want to face another murder charge . I don 't think you killed her , Eddie . I think you loved her . You ever been in love ? I have loved ... I 'm talking about something else . I 'm talking about ... feeling like you 're drowning when she 's not there . Did you ever feel that ? No . Well , that 's what we had . You know who killed her , Eddie . But you don 't trust the system . You think the game 's rigged , right ? Yeah , well , I 'm here , aren 't I ? Well , too bad you won 't have the chance to do something about it . Doctor said you 're well enough to be transferred to central booking . Put on your pants . Hey , spare 2 bucks ? Talk about inflation . Sorry , buddy . How about 3 bucks ? Keys . You don 't want to do this . Shut up . Cuffs and car . Come on , come on , come on . Been a while since we did something like this . It feels good . Ok , let 's see where he takes us . What are you doing ? What do you want ? Do you know who I am ? Yes , I do . Yes , I do . You 're Eddie , Eddie Riley . Yeah ? Eddie . That 's right . Listen to me very carefully . I 'm a very rich man . I can do things for you . What can you do for me ? Can you bring Chloe back ? - Eddie - - Shut up ! Eddie , please . Please , can we just talk ? Shut up ! Shut up ! Get down on your knees ! ok , ok . Get down on your knees ! Please , I 'll give you anything you want . What are you gonna give me ? Like the bracelet that you gave her ? She hated it ! It was a handcuff . Admit it . Look at me ! Admit it . I want to hear you say it . I swear it was an accident . She said she was gonna leave me . And then things just got out of control . I 'm sorry . So you shot her , and you dumped her body in my apartment like she was trash ? It just went off . Eddie please . Eddie . Put it down . The gun 's empty . It 's over . No one gets to die today . Thought you were gonna wait for me . Yeah , I lied . You--you didn 't have to come . Actually , I did . I , uh , thought you might want this . Yow asked before how you go on . You do what you can . You go to work , you see your friends , you cook food , get up in the morning . And one day , it changes . Don 't know why , it just does . It 's definitely an original Benwaar . And in impeccable shape . May I ask where you found it ? Goodwill . Then you 're the luckiest man alive . Tell that to my bookie . How 's 15,000 ? When I heard about this Benwaar fellow , I did a little research on him on the internet . His last desk sold at auction for 87,000 . I could go to 60 . Done . Thing about great art , it 's timeless . It 's as if the artist was speaking to us today . Smoke ? Oh , I 'll pass . Sure ? It 's Afzal molasses tobacco infused with peach resin . That stuff will kill you . Mcmanus told me what happened to your last partner . Said you had a death wish . Really ? If we 're gonna be working together , we have to trust each other . You don 't need to worry about that . You won 't be here long . Your application to narcotics wasn 't denied . Your father buried it . He wanted to protect you . You can reapply in 3 months . I will . And you 'll get in . But why ? Who are you trying to impress ? Only you , Amsterdam . You don 't need to . How did you find out about this stuff ? It 's what we do . We bring closure to people who need it . You seem to need it . Closure . It 's what we all want . * burn it down * * till the embers smoke on the ground * * and start new * * when your heart is an empty room * * with walls of the deepest blue * * home 's face * * how it ages when you 're away * * spring blooms * * and you find the love that 's true * * but you don 't know what now to do * * ' cause the chase is all you know * * and she stopped running months ago * * and all you see * * is where else you could be * * when you 're at home * * and out on the street * you will not grow old . You will not die ... How will I know when I find her ? You will feel it , here ... In your heart . * but you shed not a single tear * * for the things that you didn 't need * * ' cause you knew you were finally free * * ' cause all you see * * is where else you could be * * when you 're at home * * and out on the street * * are so many possibilities * * to not be alone * * and all you see * * is where else you could be * * when you 're at home * * there on the street * * are so many possibilities ... *

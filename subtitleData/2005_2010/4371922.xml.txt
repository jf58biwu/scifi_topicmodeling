 NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes . It 's my father 's ashes . MOHINDER : Will this work ? I 'm no closer to understanding my father 's research . What about the program in your dad 's computer ? Didn 't you say it cracked some code ? I thought he had the sequencing method to identify those with specific DNA markers . But the algorithm , it 's gibberish . The mode or method is nothing like Sylar 's last victims . MATT : I don 't think this guy is Sylar . Sylar 's kills are random . He 's never had any connection with his victims . This guy is a killer . But he 's not Sylar . EDEN : Suresh just left for India . Then stop him . I tried . also , there may have been an encounter with somebody who could stop time . He told him to save the cheerleader . So what do you want me to do with the precog ? Bring him in . Isaac Mendez ? Who are you ? She 's saying it 's not your fault , Ted . AUDREY : You did a great job in there . Look , the guy was losing his wife . He just wanted to talk to her , say goodbye . You talk to your own wife yet ? You 've been dodging her call all day . JANICE : Oh , God , he knows about the affair . ( GRUNTS ) AII right . AII right ! MOHINDER : The Earth is large . Large enough that you think you can hide from anything . From fate , from God . If only you found a place far enough away . So you run ... ( CHANTING IN SANSKRIT ) ... to the edge of the Earth , where all is safe again . Quiet and warm . The solace of salt air . BOY : Mom ! Mom ! The piece of danger left behind . The luxury of grief . And maybe for a moment , you believe you have escaped . Mohinder . You mustn 't look back , Mohinder . Your father 's moved on to the next life . Welcome back . I thought I 'd clean you up a Iittle bit . You 've had a rough couple of days , but you 're doing great . You 'II be completely clean in no time . You 're sure I 'II still be able to paint ? After I teach you , yes . The drugs were just a facilitator . We 're going to help you , Isaac . That mural on the floor , we 're not going to let that happen . You seem pretty sure . I am pretty sure . Because ? Because I went through the same thing myself . AII right , you need anything else , Sheriff ? lloyd ? Mmm-hmm . A gun to shoot Will Shortz . ( SNICKERING ) Let me see . SHERIFF : " Gandhi burial ground , " 11 letters . Something . Ganges , maybe . Kanyakumari . K-a-n-y-a , and then you 've got the rest right there . How the hell did you know that , Charlie ? That one of the stops on your trip ? Oh , a trip around the world is pricey . Right now I can only make it as far as Oklahoma City . Who won the Academy Award for best actor in 1981 ? She 's not Google , lloyd . Henry Fonda . On Golden Pond . You know , I preferred Dudley Moore in Arthur , but if you really want to test me you want to ask me if I remember your credit card numbers . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( HIRO RESPONDING IN JAPANESE ) Hey , anything looking good , guys ? ( HALTINGLY ) Everything good-Iooking . ( CHUCKLES ) Wow , you two are a Iong way from home . We don 't get a Iot of tourists out here . Tourist ? How you know we tourist ? It 's just a guess . What 's that on your jacket ? ( SPEAKS IN JAPANESE ) That means " I don 't belong here , " right ? You know Japanese ? Well , I got this Japanese phrase book for my birthday about six months ago , and I started poking through it last week . ( IN JAPANESE ) ( EXCLAIMS IN JAPANESE ) My , my , my ! You learned all that from a book in just one week ? Very good memory ! Yeah , I remember lots and lots . It 's just something that my brain started doing lately , whether I want it to or not . ( CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ) So what 'II it be ? You pick . Something delicious for me and for my friend . He needs food for fat , fat ! ( CHARLIE LAUGHS ) Okay , well , I 've got just the thing . One chiliquiles and one cottage cheese plate coming right up . ( IN JAPANESE ) Just tell me you 're not going back there again . There are no answers for me there . I belong here . I 'm glad to hear you say that . You think I was a fool to go . I think you had to . It 's an odd country , America . Everyone there seems so lonely . Including me . I 'm not sure what I accomplished by going there . Only seeing things I wish I never had . NIRAD : Mira came to pay her respects to your father , Mohinder . Maybe there 's more waiting here for you than just your professorship . The new semester begins on Monday . I didn 't cancel your classes . You can move into your father 's old office , Mohinder . Thank you . Mira ? I wasn 't sure you 'd speak to me at the funeral . I didn 't want to take that chance , so I Ieft . I won 't lie to you . I was surprised to see you there . Or anywhere , for that matter . I said some terrible things to you , about your father , about his theories . But now that he 's dead , I feel ... What 's done is done . Is it ? Your mother tells me you 're not returning to New York . The new semester starts next week . My life is here . I 've been promoted at the company . Head of all genetic research . Can you imagine ? Good for you . No , good for you . It 's the sort of cutting-edge science we used to talk about late into the night . The world 's worst pillow talk , I 'd say . I was hoping I could convince you to come in for an interview with the partners . Only I 'd have to know that your father 's work , all of his theories , would stay right where they are . Packed away in that box . I don 't expect an answer right now , but you will think about it , won 't you ? Yes . We didn 't say hello . Hello , Mira . Hello , Mohinder . ( DOOR CLOSES ) THAYER : I need you to handle this . I 'II give you one hour . You 're an idiot , Parkman . You know that ? Well , good morning to you , too . You think I wouldn 't find out about you assaulting a fellow officer ? I didn 't assault him . I just hit him . This is why I don 't like meeting people . Nine times out of ten they let you down . Wow , that 's an optimistic view of the world . Just an observation . And how did this get to be about you ? Because it was a stupid rookie move , and you could have jeopardized my investigation . How serious is this ? Are you getting suspended ? I 'II work it out . Did he deserve it ? Yeah . Yeah , he deserved it . Is he talking ? Nope . And he 's got one hour before Homeland Security sends him down the rabbit hole as a suspected terrorist . Terrorist ? We both know he 's not a terrorist . His wife was dying , he lost control . Of what ? This guy puts out 1,800 curies of radiation without ever coming in contact with nuclear material . We still don 't know how that 's possible . You know , three months ago my job made perfect sense to me . Then I pulled the Sylar case . Crime scenes with no fingerprints , bodies frozen , brains removed ... And now this guy . That 's two people ... Make that three people who can do things I just can 't explain . Wait a second . You think I 'm like them ? I don 't know what I think . But if we 're going to find Sylar , I need answers . I have no idea how this happened . Well , then I guess that just leaves Ted , here . What 's this ? Detects radiation levels . As long as that 's dark green , we 're good . Okay , but what 's the bad color ? Not green . ( CHARLIE READING IN JAPANESE ) Perfect ! You ready for disco . ( CHUCKLES ) I got it right ? almost . Don 't let me off easy , now . ( ARTICULATING PHRASE IN JAPANESE ) ( REPEATING ) You learn very fast . Yeah , lately I sort of remember everything I read . It 's kind of a skill , I guess . My skill much more complicated . Oh , yeah ? What can you do ? I can teach Japanese to anyone . ( IN JAPANESE ) " Sweet . " Means nice . Cute . That 's not in book . I Iike the way your cheeks wobble when you concentrate . ( LAUGHING ) ( BELL DINGS ) Oh , sorry . Someone 's Denver omelet 's up . ( EXCLAIMING IN JAPANESE ) They won 't even let me go to my wife 's funeral . AII I wanted was to be left alone . We need you to answer a few more questions . Can 't you get your partner here to look inside my head ? We need to have it on the record . You burnt that doctor to the bone , probably gave your wife cancer . How 'd you do it ? Ted . Ted , if you don 't let us help you they 're going to take you away , and nobody 'II listen to you . Doesn 't matter . Nothing matters . I killed my wife ! Audrey . You know , just lock me up . Execute me . Leave me the hell alone . I wish we could , Ted . I don 't know anything about any nuclear materials ! Ted . Ted ! You know what ? Just relax . You want me to be the terrorist ? Huh ? You want me to be the bad guy ? Fine , I 'II blow this place apart . AUDREY : Ted ! Ted ... Stop ! Just stop ! Do it . Do it ! Ted ! Do it ! Ted , I know what you 're going through . Yeah , sure you do . Yeah , Iike hell you do . Come on , Ted ! You 've seen what I can do ! Okay ? Something is happening to me , too ! Ted , I was able to read your wife 's dying thoughts . We 're just trying to understand what it is . Ted ! Come on , Ted , relax . Come on , just take me back . Take me back to when this all started , okay ? Just start from the beginning . Good . TED : I blacked out , and then when I woke up everything started dying . You blacked out ? How long were you out for ? Were you drinking ? When you came to , did you have bruises on your arms ? I 'll do you one better . What 's the matter , Parkman ? ( SIGHS ) CHANDRA : I 'm going . MOHINDER : Don 't walk away . It doesn 't matter what you think . I 'm not asking your opinion . Yes , how could I have forgotten ? You never have before , why should now be any different ? It is my Iife ! I 'm going and that 's final . Has it never occurred to you that your actions could affect anyone else ? I don 't have time for anyone else 's feelings . clearly ! The world needs to know about my findings . That 's all that 's important . The world doesn 't care . No one at the university cares . You 're becoming a laughing stock . I can 't cover for you any longer . I 'm not asking you to ! How will you support yourself ? What will you do for money ? Oh , I 'II get by ! How ? Do you know what doctors do in the United States ? They drive taxi cabs . It is one thing to publish a book in the comfort of the university . It is another to leave everything behind , your wife , your family , your job , chasing a theory that is pure fantasy ! It 's a fool 's errand . We 'II see who will be the fool , won 't we ? Yes , I guess we will . Mohinder is right . I am abandoning my family , my job . You are . But I know you , Chandra , better than you know yourself . You will not stop thinking of this if you don 't go . It will consume you , and eventually all of us with it . He will hate me for it . I 'm not sure that he doesn 't already . I should try to stay , for his sake . Why ? He will never take a place in your eyes . That has always been the case . Who are you ? What do you want ? I was in Kansas a couple months back . I 'd just made a big sale to the university hospital . Dialysis machines . ( SCOFFS ) The commission was going to give Karen and me enough money to ... ( SIGHS ) I went to the hotel bar . Buy everybody a few rounds . There weren 't many people there . A couple from Wyoming , some professors , a student from Haiti . The next thing I know , I 'm waking up in my car . It 's two days later , and I 'm in Tempe , Arizona . These weird cuts and bruises all over me . A couple of days later , I started to notice things . I 'd buy my wife flowers and they 'd wilt . Okay , what about your health ? I mean , were you sick ? Do you have headaches ? Yeah . Headaches . But ... Karen ... The doctor said she had radiation poisoning . From you ? I was killing her . Are there any other bodies out there we don 't know about ? ( SIGHS FORCIBLY ) I 'm just saying . This is not his fault . He 's just trying to figure this out . Look , the same thing happened to me . Okay , I blacked out . I lost two days . You should 've told me about this . I should 've done a Iot of things . Up until now , I haven 't told anyone . Not even my wife . And now I can 't stop hearing people 's thoughts . It 's painful . I 'm hearing things that I should not be hearing . Like what ? Things that could ruin lives , things that could end marriages . The guy that you described , the student , he was Haitian . Big guy ? Bald ? Yeah . Yeah ! I 'm telling you , I think I saw this guy right before I blacked out , too . What are you guys talking about ? A Haitian guy ? These things that we can do , they 're not normal . We were cut . We were injected . BIacked out . Who knows what they did to us . Or how they changed us . ( DOOR OPENS ) THAYER : Time 's up . What ? AUDREY : Just a couple more minutes . And you , you shouldn 't even be here . Your badge has been suspended . Did he tell you where the nuclear material is ? Move it . He 's coming with me . What ? No , you can 't take him right now . Yeah , they can . Find the Haitian . Find him ! You gotta get him back in here . I can 't . What do you mean , you can 't ? You heard what he said . He 's gonna help me figure out what happened to me . Why did you lie to me about being suspended ? Okay , so I Ieft that part out . But you have come to me and asked for my help , and I come running to you every single time . So now I 'm asking for your help . AII right ? Get him back in here so I can talk to him . I 'm sorry , it 's out of my hands . That 's good . Mr. Bennet . Rufus . I got next month 's parking sticker . Just need you to sign for it . I 'II take care of that later , Rufus . Oh ! Sorry . Sorry . How 's he doing ? Heroin 's out of his system . His body doesn 't want it anymore , but his mind still does . Coherent ? Very . You ready to meet him ? Yeah . Isaac ? This is Mr. Bennet , the man I told you about . Hello , Isaac . Drawing anything interesting ? ( SIGHS ) It 's nothing . You know , that 's not true . You have the ability to paint the future . That 's something . Something very important . Feels like a curse . No , it 's a blessing . Don 't let anybody tell you differently . We 're gonna help you understand that . I 'm grateful you 're helping me , I 'm just not sure why you 're doing it . To be 100 % honest with you , I need your help . CHARLIE : How we doing ? Yeah . ( CHUCKLING ) Good . ( RATTLING ) ( METAL SCRAPING FORCEFULLY ) ( CRASHING ) ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) ( SOBBING ) Oh , my God ! Charlie . She 's dead . MOTHER : I know you miss him , and I know you feel guilty , too . Don 't . I had a dream last night . You and father were talking before he left , and in it you persuaded him to go . It 's just a dream , Mohinder . No , I need to know if it was true . Your father and I were married for 33 years . That is not an answer . Yes , it is . A marriage doesn 't last that long without allowing the other person to be who he has to be . How could you allow him to abandon everything , just like that ? I 'm afraid that answer is not as easy . In the dream you said that I could never take the place of her . Who did you mean ? I suppose it 's time that you knew now that your father 's gone . Mohinder , you had a sister . A sister ? Her name was Shanti . She was five years old when she died , two years after you were born . But why didn 't I know this ? Because it was too painful to talk about , especially for your father . He loved her so much . He was afraid that you would compare his love . From the moment she was born , he was convinced that she was special . And she was special . ISAAC : These dates . Suicide bomber . 15 people dead . Train derailment , nine dead . Earthquake , 81 . This girl , the one you 've painted here , and here , and there , she 's my daughter . My claire . This man here goes by the name of Sylar . He 's going to kill her tomorrow night at her homecoming game . Why ? Because she 's special , Iike you . And that makes her a target . Like me . You 're not the only one with special abilities , Isaac . There are others . Sylar is killing them , one at a time . ( EXHALES ) If you know who he is , then why can 't you stop him ? Because nobody knows where he is . I need your help . I need you to paint this painting . I 'm sorry . I 've been trying . I can 't . Not without the drugs . Fine . I promise , we will help you use your abilities , without this , but right now there just isn 't time . I 'm fighting to get my Iife back , and you want me to just throw it away . You know , for many years now , a number of us have been tracking , locating , monitoring people like you . Sometimes the process goes smoothly , as in your case , but other times ... Well , Iet 's just say some people misinterpret our motives , and then it can go very wrong . Fourteen years ago , there was just such a case , which , sadly , ended in a death . Well , one left behind a baby girl who had no one to take care of her . My wife and I had been having a hard time conceiving a child of our own at the time , and ... And it was like ( VOICE BREAKING ) God had reached down and given us a miracle . Isaac , this is my daughter we 're talking about . I 'm begging you . Let me try one more time , without them . ( COMPUTER RUNNING ) ( KEYBOARD CLICKING ) Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Hey , wait ! Stop ! Come back here . DISPATCHER : I got a pickup at 1500 Broadway to JFK . No ! Father ! Father ! Help ! Father ! Father ! Stop ! Stop . Stop . Stop . Dad ! claire ? Honey ? Is everything all right ? Yeah , everything 's fine . Can 't a girl just visit her dad at work ? You never visit me at work . Okay , I 'm busted . I have an emergency . A paper emergency . A paper emergency ! A paper emergency ! Miss Roberts says we need a banner over the trophy case , and Jackie was all , " We don 't have paper that big ! " They don 't make paper that big ! " So I thought I 'd stop by and try to be a hero . ( SIGHS DRAMATICALLY ) Well , if it 'II make you a hero and maybe knock Jackie down a few notches , we might be able to find something that 'II work . Best dad ever . I 'm sorry , Mr. Bennet , we just have a Iittle situation . You know what ? The sample room is right down there , claire Bear . You take anything you need . Okay ? Thanks , Dad . First door on your left . I 'm sorry , I didn 't know she 'd be here . So what 's the problem ? It 's not working . He can 't do it . He tried , he 's just not there yet . We tried his way , now we do it mine . He has worked so hard to get clean . You can 't ask him to do this . I 'm not going to ask him . You are . No ! No , you can 't make me do that . You knew this was a possibility . You said when we started that I would never have to do it again . You promised me . I know what you think . Who do you think taught you ? Do you even remember what you were when I found you ? You 're the easy way . I think we both know the hard way . ( INAUDIBLE ) Did she say anything ? Sounded like she was scared ? No . She seemed very nice . She was . Too nice to die like that , head ripped open . I ain 't never seen anything like it . We 're very sorry . Y 'all stick around . Need to take your statements . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Hiro ? ( IN JAPANESE ) Hiro ? ( KEYS JINGLING ) Oh , is that Ensenada ? Mmm . Pam Balton called to ask me why you punched Tom McHenry . I told her you didn 't . Did you ? Yeah . Yeah , I punched him . He knows . Damn it , I knew it . You punched a superior officer . That has to have some kind of repercussions . He may out rank me , but " superior " is taking it a Iittle too far . I got one month 's suspension , no pay . Jesus , Matt . Something happened between me and Tom . ( SCOFFS ) You slept with him . ( WHISPERING ) Yes . Is it over ? Yes . Are we ? ( WHISPERING ) I don 't know . ( PHONE RINGING ) Yeah , it 's Matt . He 's gone ! What ? Ted ! He escaped . MAN : Watch out ! Do you hear me ? Yeah . Yeah , I heard you . MAN : Hurry up ! MOHINDER : You can run far , you can take your small precautions , but have you really gotten away ? Can you ever escape ? Or is the truth that you do not have the strength or cunning to hide from destiny ? What ? Nothing . ( SCOFFS ) But the world is not small . You are . And fate can find you anywhere .

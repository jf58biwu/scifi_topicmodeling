 Previously on Bionic Woman ... What is going on , Jaime ? Just tell me , okay ? I need to know . I can 't . What 's this ? Student ID . You 're going to college . Transfer student from Oxford . Merciful TA . Tom Gilchrist . Can I interest you in a tasty beverage ? Be right back . Who are you ? Who are you ? I asked you first . You 're freaking FBI , aren 't you ? You were supposed to leave this to us . What ? Are you , like , a CIA agent ? Well , what the hell are you ? I 'm with the Berkut Group . They 're making the drop . All right . I 'll go down . You stay up here and cover me . Don 't underestimate me . You all right ? Yeah . Not a good idea . What about you ? What 's your story ? It 's my last night at college . Can we just hang out ? Yeah . $ 250,000 cash . Walking around money . Five million in bearer bonds . As requested . I 've done my part . Where 's the list ? Right . The list . Move , move , move ! Blue Team , go ! We 're in ! Move , move , move ! This one 's still alive . Get the chopper down . I want him alive , and brought to Berkut . Bring it in . Copy that . He is ? Okay . Excellent . Wait . Did you mention me ? What did he say ? Really ? Shut up ! Yeah . Tonight at 8 : 00 . Okay . All right . See you then . Guess who 's coming over tonight for Tarantino movie night . Brennan . Brennan . Actually , I think I 'm going to call him . No . You are not calling him . Rule number one . Let him call you . Rule number one ? Come on . There are a list of rules and they are ironclad . Oh . " The List of Rules . " Okay . I cannot believe you read that book . That is , seriously , anti-feminist . I 'm just saying , calling a guy is the kiss of death . Even if you thought you spent an incredible , meaningful night with somebody and they followed that up with eight days of stone cold silence . What are you talking about ? The rules . Let him take the lead . Rule five . Be mysterious . Rule six . And don 't ever split the check . Rule 10 . Wow . I mean , am I allowed to vote or own property ? Ha , ha . I am trusting you and your friends to have a good night , okay ? No smoking . No drinking , no driving . And more importantly , no calling Brennan . Okay . You are seriously way behind the times . You should have a word with him . I understand you worked for Victor Booth . I also understand you have a wife , children . The last thing you would want is for something to happen to them . What did you find out ? The sale is set up at the Sahrawi Embassy in Paris . Put a team together . This is the last known photograph of Victor Booth . Who 's Victor Booth ? He 's an arms dealer , among other things . And he doesn 't seem to have any permanent address . Multiple reconstructive surgeries . Uses decoys , doesn 't get photographed . So , nobody knows what he looks like . That image is eight years old . The only good thing about it is we can see the eyes . What does Berkut want with him ? He killed one of my men last night . Our operative was set up as a buyer for a list we really need . Somehow , Victor got wind of the fact that he was Berkut . He killed him and left the cash , which was smart , since the bills were traceable . We 've since learned he 's set up another buyer . Learned from who ? The CIA . I thought CIA and Berkut hated each other . We do . But , in this case , we 're forced to work together . We both need Victor 's list . What 's on the list ? The identities of CIA and Berkut operatives . Now , Intel says Victor 's on his way to Paris . Given the nature of the situation , the CIA 's going to insist that we send somebody in there with you . So , I 'm going to Paris with a CIA agent ? That 's right . Can I pick who ? This isn 't a kickball game , Jaime . Well , I just thought that , you know , since time is of the essence , it would be good to skip the " getting to know you " part and just hit the ground running . Tom Gilchrist and I seemed to get the job done last week . Okay . You want to call him ? No . You go ahead . I don 't call guys . You 're missing the point , Jaime . Really ? Because I think , I just kicked your ass . Discretion . You have to be able to neutralize the enemy in public without anyone ever seeing it . Once you 're exposed to the world , you lose all value as a weapon . You know what I love most ? Being referred to as a weapon . You all right ? Tom . Jae . Good luck . Long time . Nine days . So , are you ready for Paris ? Yep . By the way , thanks for calling me in on this . Oh , I didn 't call you . Jonas called you . Okay . So , here 's the plan . When we land in de Gaulle , we 've got to move fast . De Gaulle . You know , I hate Paris . I mean , if I 'm being honest , I just , I don 't get the allure . I 've never been . You haven 't ? It 's the most romantic place in the world . You 're going to love it . Really ? Yeah . Romantic . Yeah . My parents took me there when I was 12 . Fifteen churches and five museums in one day . Gun , mouth . The Louvre . Don 't do it to yourself . Nathan . Can we concentrate on the case ? Let 's get down to it . All right , Jae , you and I will take Nathan to the safe house and we 'll set up shop with the rest of the CIA team . Meanwhile , Tom and Jaime you 're going to assume your cover and check into the hotel . How did Berkut find Victor ? Last week , one of our top operatives made contact . He was killed trying to buy the list . Victor means business . He 's sold names before . The three operatives on the last list were all dead 48 hours after it was sold . And if our intel is correct , there 's over 100 names on this list . Which means we 're talking about not only American security , but the immediate safety of over 100 men and women and their families . So , if we can get those names , we can protect those people . So , is the sale definitely going down tonight ? The one thing that we know for sure is it 's happening tonight . And we need to get a positive ID on Victor from among two to three hundred guests . So you two have to make eye contact with as many Eurotrash tool-bags as you can and we 'll take care of the rest at the safe house . All right . We bring Victor into custody and we keep the list from getting into enemy hands . Let 's go do it . Sounds good . Hey . Let 's keep it professional , you two . Monsieur-dame . Bonjour . Have you seen Breathless ? Jean-Luc Godard ? No . I bet you haven 't seen a single movie made before 1983 . The Breakfast Club ? Thanks for playing . We have some lovely parting gifts . Bonjour . We need two rooms . I didn 't know you spoke French . I was in Turkmenistan . No , no . You go ahead . Well , that 's why I didn 't call . Bad service ? Who 's your carrier ? I know it sounds lame , doesn 't it ? No , no . It sounds really important . Well , it was important . But you understand that , right ? Saving lives , national security , that kind of thing ? I mean , you 're ... You 're in the game , too . Right ? Sure . Yeah . C 'est la vie . I gather I 'm Madame Lodato . Does that make me your wife or your mom ? My very chic wife . I 'm a lucky man . Oh . I almost forgot . You all right ? Yep . Wow . Look at the view . Yeah . It 's great , right ? Well , since we 're a married couple , we should just watch TV and not have sex . That 's a great idea . I wonder if they have Deal or No Deal . Say it in French . You know ... You don 't have to worry . I 'll just ... I 'll sleep on the couch . I think that 's a better idea . Yeah . What 's up , Jae ? Hey . Comment Ã§a va , everybody ? Nathan . Wow . They 're not very friendly . Is this the French CIA ? Wait until you meet their handler . All right , I installed the iris recognition software I got from my friend at ... Oh , wait . I can 't tell you where I got it , because then ... No . Don 't say ... I 'd have because then you 'd have to kill me . ... to kill you . All I need to know is whether this will effectively identify Victor . Jaime needs to lock onto people 's eyes . Once she does , the program converts the details of the iris stromal pattern into a bit pattern that I can cross-reference . Once I affirm the match , I apprise Agent Sommers so that she can determine the means to extricate the mark to the jimjam . You realize that spies don 't really talk that way . I know ! That blows ! I 'm just trying to bring back the cool . Anyway , if Jaime meets Victor 's eyes , we 'll find him . Victor 's altered his appearance . Numerous times . Even if Victor has gone Victoria the program is airtight . Okay ? This biometric technology makes Photoshop look like Pong . Unprecedented false rate match . Like , never . Even these geniuses can 't change their eyes . I wouldn 't be so sure about that . Alexis . Ruth . Nice work in Dubai . Where did you find your floater ? High school sweetheart . Jaime Sommers . That 's a new name . How long has she been ... What is she , 12 ? How did you find her ? Happy accident . Iris recognition . I doubt your operative can get 200 captures during the cocktail party . I don 't know . Our girl is pretty good . Dude . Don 't touch my stuff . There 's a lot of security , but we knew that . Yeah . Packing semi-automatics outside the embassy is a pretty big deal . If they 're doing that . Are they ? They are . So , what 's the Embassy party for , anyway ? Environmentalists . I didn 't know environmentalists liked to party . Hey , if we ID Victor before 8 : 00 , croissants on me . It 's going to be more complicated than that . I know . I was trying to lighten the mood . Geez . Jaime . I have to go out into the field with a clear head . And if I lose focus for a second , I 'm dead . Now , I can handle that responsibility when it 's just about me . But I can 't even begin to think about screwing up and as a result , you ... Personal relationships can compromise the mission ... Yeah . I get it . I do . I like you . I really do ... Look . I think we should just be friends . Good . Good . We haven 't even had a second date . Exactly . It 's going to be fine . Yeah . That 's right . We 're just partners executing a job . I thought you guys said that Brennan was going to call . Because he didn 't . That 's a bad sign , right ? Calm down . He 's coming over . You guys will hang out , we 'll watch Reservoir Dogs , and ... You two will hook up . No . The end . No . No . I don 't really want to hook up during Reservoir Dogs . Okay . I guess I can make that work . Hey , Becca . This is my friend , Annie . Hi , Rebecca . It 's Becca . Annie didn 't even know who Quentin Tarantino was . Oh , shut up ! Hey . Hey . Sorry . Excuse me . Hopefully , the receiving line is still happening . That way , we can split up and cover more ground . I figure he could look like anyone . So , we have ... Could you zip me up ? The drop needs to happen by 9 : 45 . We 've got to ID Victor before then . Security , 3 o 'clock , 9 o 'clock . Surveillance cameras in the Grandfather clock and ugly flower arrangements . Okay . How are you getting that ? Oh , come on . What do those guys teach you at Langley , anyway ? A possible target ID northwest corner . Funny . I would have said by the buffet . Shut up . Perhaps , we can debate Lithuanian tariff 's another time . Mrs. Varnas is in Basle . Not our guy . He 's about to leave with her , and it 's not even 9 : 00 yet . Okay . What do these Euro-douches have over me ? Wealth . Power . Dignity . No match . Plenty of targets . Let 's look around . It 's ... Him ? No . No way . They 've got Shaolin monks , here . This is a great party . Why am I not there ? By the bar . Nope . No , look at his hands . They 're in the Broken Zipper position . Below and in front of the waist . Sign of defensiveness . Everything we have on our guy says he 's a sociopath . Cool and confident . Okay . Fernando ! Is that you ? May I help you , SeÃ±orita ? It 's okay . He looks like a Fernando . Not him . Let 's go . No match . Sorry . I mistook you for somebody else . And it 's SeÃ±ora . Now ... He could be our man . He 's not a diplomat . Shoes aren 't shined , he 's not wearing a cummerbund , and his jacket is one size too big . Ooh . Tom . You 're ... You 're an analyst ... You psychoanalyze people . Neurosurgeon and you 're a therapist . We 're running out of time . Drinking . Why not ? Let 's drink , now . This is what we do at work . Do you know you 're at work ? What about him ? Yeah . How about ... Yeah . Colonel Sanders , over here . He looks good . That 's a rare vintage in this town . Only thing I order when I 'm in Paris . Drives the French nuts . So , I take it you 're not from Paris . No . I just couriered a package over here this morning . Got roped into this little get-together . It 's a rental . Catch his eye . Catch his eye . Catch his eye . C 'est la vie . Come on . Look her in the eye . Come on . I 'm based in D.C. You ? I 'm a professor at Stanford , and my husband is an art historian doing research at the Picasso Museum . Cool . No . I 'm here for the Van Gogh retrospective ... Oh . ... actually . She 's a beautiful lady . Come on . What are you doing ? He 's looking at everything but your eyes . Come on , Casino Royale . I 'm shaken and I 'm stirred . Okay . Come on . What 's your favorite Picasso ? My ... fave ... Well , no . I ... I 'm focused mainly on the Impressionists . Right . But as an art historian , you must have at least a passing interest in Picasso . I like the Blue Period . Yeah . The Blue Period rocks . Favorite ? Dora Maar au Chat . Do you know it ? No . I don 't . You 'd know it if you saw it . Look . When I was dropping off this package this morning there was this piece in the secretary 's office by Picasso . But I can 't tell if it 's original . Maybe you could take a look at it for me and ... Well , maybe later . We just got here and ... Honey , let 's see it . Maybe it 's one you don 't know . That a girl ! That 's what I 'm talking about . Okay . It 's close . Just one flight down . Right up your alley . Thank you . Thanks . I 've got a hunch . What are you doing ? Just go with it . All right . There we go . Come on . We 've got to get a clear shot of his eyes . Let 's do this . Right through here . First door on the left . Yes ! Finally ! We have a match . That 's him . That 's Victor . Yes , yes . See you . Oh ! Come on ! I know it 's him . We lost him . How ? He locked us in a wine vault . Getting locked in a wine vault is a clichÃ© . And do I need to remind you that you 're bionic ? Yeah . I know . I 'm on it . I 'll call you back . Let me help . Well , you 've been such a great help so far . Pardon me ? " Honey , let 's go see that Picasso . Maybe it 's one you don 't know . " Everyone knows that 's Picasso 's most famous painting ! Everyone ! Hey . You 're the one that went down Picasso Road . I was briefed in Van Gogh . And then , you 're like , " Oh , let 's just go down into this dark basement " with a strange man . " Anybody can be surprised ! It 's embarrassing , is what ... Ass ! You know , the buy is happening now . Can we just try this together ? What do you weigh ? A buck ten ? Yeah , that will make a huge difference . Whatever . Suit yourself . Yeah . We 'll see . Whatever . Thanks . I loosened it . Whatever . Come on . Excuse me . Did you see that ? See what ? Work with me . Hey . Hey ! Excuse me ... Yes ? The only place we could find a little privacy . Okay . I need you now to turn around and go to the stairs . Okay ? How much am I going to have to pay you to look the other way ? Sorry . You know , I was going to do that . Sorry . That 's all right . Nice technique . Thank you . Okay . Let 's go . Yeah . I 'm just going to go , okay ? What ? I 'm just going to go . Becca , you ... Look , I 'm fine , okay ? It 's fine . Awesome . Awesome . Jerk ! License and registration . Um ... Hey . All right , I 'm going in alone . You 're kidding , right ? I know you can handle yourself , but these guys could be armed . You 're not ready for this . Victor 's in that room . That 's the mission . We both have to go in there . No . It 's too dangerous . We both knew it was dangerous before we came to Paris . Nothing 's changed . Yes , it has ! Oh ! So , I 'm your trophy spy . Oh , come on . This is harder than I thought it was going to be . Okay . You know what ? Just hang back . You don 't get to corner the market on brave . We both have to go in there . You may think you 're being a gentleman , but it 's condescending . Get over yourself . I 'll take him . Yeah . Jaime ! No ! Go ! You okay ? Yeah . Lift him up . Clear ! Let 's go ! There 's nothing on him . There 's no list . It 's not Victor . It looks like him , but it 's not him ! Go . Now . Wait ! We have to go back for Tom ! There 's no time . Where is Victor ? Hey , we had a lock . It 's not my fault she takes out a whole new guy . Why hasn 't Tom called ? We 're trying to locate his tracking device . It says he 's still at the embassy , but the GPS could have been knocked loose and left behind . He 's still there . We have to go back and just go in . Hello . It 's sovereign territory . Just going in is not an option . Where did she come from ? You cost me quite a lot of money tonight . Who do you work for ? The Metropolitan Museum of Art . Really ? The only reason you 're not dead yet is ... I forgot . Yeah ? Can I talk to Tom ? Tom . It 's for you . Tom ? I can 't believe you called me . Shut up . Are you okay ? Honey , everything 's fine . You know how much I love to hang out with the guys . Don 't worry . I 'm going to be fine . Don 't ... Let me guess . You want your husband back . This is the wife , right ? Yes . Good for you . You want him back . I 'm afraid , it 's going to cost you quite a lot . I do want him back . And I also want the list . The list ? Really ? Really . Six million dollars . Fine . Two million for your husband . Great . One hour . Go to the cafe Sartre at the Clingnancourt . Fifty percent in cash the rest in bearer bonds . If I see you with anyone else , I 'll cut your fake husband into real pieces . Does Tom have Victor ? No . Reverse that . We can get Tom and the list for eight million . The drop 's in 58 minutes . What makes you think I can get eight million dollars in less than an hour ? You can 't ? I 'm not authorized to release that amount . Can you call someone who is ? Is that a yes ? Give me a minute . Whatever . We still have 57 of them . Can you get the money ? I know someone who can . Yeah . Can you get me eight million dollars in , say 45 minutes ? Okay . Thank you . Okay ? It 's for the mission , right ? No , I found this great pair of shoes . You know , being flip doesn 't engender my trust . It 's to buy the list . I 'll authorize the wire . Nathan knows the account . Thank you . Just get it done . Hi , Becca . Thanks . Wait . You 're Jaime 's boss ? Yeah . Yeah . Sorry . She said I should call you if there was an emergency . So ... Driving without a license , underage and intoxicated . I 'd say that qualifies . Well , thanks for your help . But I 'm just going to go call one of my friends ... Wait , wait , wait . I 'm responsible for getting you home . And along the way we can have a little chat . We can 't go in after Tom . What ? We 're not authorized to do any more here . My hands are tied . Your agent 's life 's on the line and that 's your response ? This is a ghost mission , now . Tom is solely accountable . He knows that 's how it works . He wouldn 't want us to put other agents ' lives in jeopardy . He 's compromised , Jaime . What would you say if I told you I 'm going to go in and get him ? I 'd say good for you . Who 's going to have my back in there ? I 'm going to be with you every step of the way . Okay ? Are we good ? Absolutely . All right . You have a mic and an earwig . We can talk to you , you can talk to us . I don 't like you in the market alone . I won 't be alone . You and Jae will be covering me . You just can 't be with me . It 's too dangerous to Tom . Jaime , Berkut is allowing you to carry eight million dollars to get the list . Not to hang out with your boyfriend . I have a degree in psychology . Quit playing with that ring . There isn 't time to reinvent the plan . The list is the only reason we 're here . She can do it . $ 240,000 in cash . The rest in bearer bonds . You good ? Yeah . Drop me here . So , I 'm supposed to believe my sister 's selling timeshares ? Yeah . What are the most popular timeshares ? I 'd have to say Arizona . No . No . It 's too hot . Old people like that . I mean , what is my sister doing selling them ? If I had to guess , I 'd say she 's trying to earn a decent living so she can take care of you . Great . I realize why she wanted me to call you . It 's like a guilt trip once removed . Sorry . I didn 't mean to lay a guilt trip on you . I have a daughter . She 's accused me of that before . She 's probably right , so I apologize . It 's okay . I mean , she ... I 'm not into Jaime 's list of secrets , you know ? It 's like some things she just puts on this repeat loop . And then , others she totally clams up about . You know , we 're sisters . Like , okay , her fiancÃ© . She never talks about him . And he died . I mean , that 's weird , right ? We 're family . We should be able to talk about that stuff . Yeah . You should . Are you going to say " Maybe she has her reasons " ? Maybe she does , you know ? Just keep walking to the center of the cafÃ© . Fine . But I want you to ... Damn it . Hey . Pretty lady . Care to join me ? Here we are . Our second date . Not a cheap one . How much ? $ 8 million . Oh , God . I don 't mind saying I expect you to put out . Now , that 's very forward of you . You must be American . That looks nice on you . Don 't worry about it . It 's cubic zirconia . No , it 's not . Okay , it 's not . I do have an expense account . So , it 's a write-off . Now , you 're making me sound like I 'm not romantic . Well ... Jaime , I shouldn 't have said any of that stuff on the roof . No , Tom . No . I was way out of line . It was complete crap . I didn 't mean what I said at the embassy . You mean about me being condescending ? Any of it . No , I shouldn 't have said any of that stuff to you . Clearly , you can kick some ass . I can . You can . God , you 're beautiful . You realize that the minute that you put the money on the table , we 're dead . Right ? Right . And if you didn 't bring any money , we 're also dead ? Yeah . Did you read comic books as a kid ? No . I did . I loved them . My favorite was this one called Freedom Fighters . There was this great character called the Human Bomb . My God . Whoa ! Bombs . No . Nobody said bombs . Oh . Great . Want an espresso ? Good evening . I 've got a list of specials . Bingo . Got it . Pay dirt . Actually , I 'm not that hungry . CafÃ© policy , mademoiselle . You cannot sit at the table without paying . I can pay . Good . Don 't ! Get away from me ! How do I deactivate it ? You can 't ! Now , let me check the manual . Can I look ? Give me two seconds . Two seconds . No . No ! It 's a solar fuse detonator . One of the leads is hot . The other two are decoys . You pull the wrong lead ... Are you sure ? Yeah . It 's ... It 's the ... Black wire ! I 'm sure . Yank that puppy . Wait ! Wait ! Yank it ! Lucky guess . Thanks . You 're welcome . Holy ... All right . Stay out of the open . Watch out ! Watch out ! Watch out ! Tom ! What ... Where the hell did you come from ? How the hell did you get here ? I 'm a really fast runner . So , they recovered about $ 4 million . The rest is working its way into the French economy . Well , I was actually carrying $ 8 million , so in a way , I got the list for half price . Listen . Don 't just call me for money . Call for back-up . This time , we came out ahead . But we could have done better . I was thinking about Tom . I was thinking about you . What about the CIA ? What about them ? You give them Victor ? Yeah . But they left Tom . They abandoned him . Frankly , Victor 's a lot better off with the CIA . By the way , my sister didn 't call , did she ? I gave her your number . No . How did you get to Victor before I did ? And how did you figure out the explosive device ? Don 't tell me you guessed . Please . I didn 't guess . I ... What ? I don 't know how to tell you how I did it . The whole time you were working on the wiring , I should have been scared for my life . But actually , I was just thinking about how nice your hair smells . Okay , you know what ? What ? I will not wait eight days again for you to call me . Okay . You 've got one more shot at this thing , Tom . Two strikes and you 're out . Rule 27 . Hey , how about dinner ? I mean , we 're in Paris and all . I 'd love to . But I have to get back to my sister . No dinner the same day you save a guy 's life . Is that Rule number 26 or ... That 's not a rule . That 's just me needing to see my sister . Okay . I 'll call you . Becca ? Hello ? You here ? I thought you weren 't coming back until 7 : 00 . What are you doing that you shouldn 't be ? If you tell me first , before I find out , I might not freak . I 'm not doing anything . Becca ... Come here . Sure this isn 't a diversion to get your guy , Brennan , out a window ? Oh , please . Brennan is yesterday 's drama . Wow . It 's warm . I put it in the dryer . I 'm so sorry I assumed you did something bad . You know , I worry about you so much when I 'm away and I worry about whether I 'm doing the right thing and I 'm just so tired . Look , I know what you 're giving up for me . Well , for us . I am exactly where I want to be right now . Okay ? Go take a bath . Yeah . I think I will . Thank you .

Peter 's not interested . you could talk to him . Tell him it 's about stopping sylar . You say that name again , and I will break your neck . Do you know where bennet is ? As far as I know , he 's still rustling cattle in texas . How are the receipts tonight , marco ? It was a good night , ma 'am . Good . You don 't have to be here . I told you that I can handle it .

You lost your son , niki- - it 's called letting go . Maybe you should give it a try . Or would you rather go off with your buddy and fight the pain away ? I 'm not going anywhere . This is all misunderstanding . Home land security.NY Hiro nakamura.Born osaka , japan , to kaito and ishi . Teleportation.Stopping time . Prison breaks.Attacks against U.S.Interests. No , I don 't think there 's any misunderstanding . Prison breaks ? two years ago , you killed a lot of good men when you raided the national science center in raleigh . No , I know myself . I 'm not a killer . How can you not remember that ? Because I do not know what you are talking about . I 'm talking about men like you and sylar ruining it for the rest of us . Making us live in fear , captivity , and hiding . Making us choose sides . Tearing families apart . I would never tear a family apart . I just want to be a hero . I don 't know what kind of game you 're playing , nakamura . What you 're hiding.But I 'm gonna get it out of you . That 's right.We got him . We 've been after him for years , and today he decides to get sloppy just before the anniversary ? I thought that 'd be good news to announce at the speech tomorrow . This can 't be a coincidence.They 're up to something . I need to know what it is . That could be a problem . He doesn 't seem to remember anything about the last five years . You sure it 's- - it 's really him ? It 's not a trick or an illusion or something ? Anything seems possible these days . There be something we 've overlooked . You 're a mind reader , parkman . Rip it out of him . If you can 't do it , I 'll get someone who can . Yes , sir , mr.President. Send in the professor . I 'm sorry to keep you waiting . We 've captured hiro nakamura in manhattan . That 's excellent news , mr.President. It seems we 're running into some problems . You 're the only person I trust to figure out what 's going on up there . I 'll be on the first flight to new york . Thank you.That 's not why I asked you here.Please sit down . Five years ago , you and I allowed a man to blow up in new york . Millions of lives came to an end , and the world was changed . Soon after we sat down in my office.Do you remember ? Of course.We made a pact to eliminate such danger at any cost . Billions in research later ... how close are we to that ? We , uh ... we 're not much closer to reversing their condition than when we started . What 's the problem ? It 's hard coded in their dna . It 's like they 're a separate species . We cannot change who they are , mr.President. So in other words , we 've failed . - No , no , the measures we 've put in place - - they 're not working . We 've outlawed their breeding.We 've confined their movement . We police them.We track them . Their attacks continue . Their population is increasing exponentially . Your numbers . Yesterday in santa cruz , a boy somehow sucked all the oxygen out of the air . Suffocated his entire middle school . My god . These events are increasing . People are anticipating another sylar . In your original assessment , you posited a potential solution.Extinction. Yes , but I never meant to suggest that- - " they wouldn 't be the first species " to be exterminated for the preservation of another . " Your words . I was talking about the natural order of things . What you 're talking about is genocide . Self-defense . And I 'm not suggesting it lightly . We 've just run out of options . You haven 't slept in five years , mohinder . We need to put an end to this . You 're one of them , nathan . Am I supposed to march you off to the gas chambers as well ? I 'm thankful for the secrets you 've kept . But let 's be honest.I can fly . I 'm hardly dangerous . I value your opinion as a scientist and a friend . But if I gave you five years , ten years , 20 more years , be honest with me ... could you reverse it ? No.Probably not . Then we need to start thinking about plan B. I don 't care about five years ago . What are you planning for tonight ? You are like me.Special. Why do you want to hurt other special people ? Yeah , it 's parkman . Suresh ? What 's he doing there ? Watch him . you ready ? Pad turns red ... primatech paper company , odessa , texas . you 're one of them and they 'll arrest you . Pad turns blue , you 're free to go . From now on you will be the cranes from boise , idaho . We 've enclosed back stories , references , and money , okay ? How do we know when we 're safe ? You don 'T.Not ever . Always keep a refrigerated sample of this on your person . Buy a thermos . Now you 're gonna have to be vigilant . Always on the lookout . Can you do that , son ? Yes , sir.Good man . Okay , we have to go . Do whatever it takes to protect him . It 's out of the question . It 's homeland security.I need help getting in there . These people trust me . They come to me to keep them hidden . You 're asking me to do the exact opposite ! I 'm only asking for the ones that I brought to you . D.L. , Candice , molly walker . And they 'll all be safe when we succeed . Sorry , I can 't help you . He saved your daughter 's life . Excuse me ? Your daughter.The cheerleader . She 's alive because of hiro . What is he talking about ? Five years ago , I asked peter to save claire from sylar at homecoming . My friend tells me he did it . Claire 's alive . Isn 't she ? You guys sit tight . I 'll see what I can do . Each string represents a person . Every action , every choice . How people came together , how they were torn apart . It 's a living map of the past . Why would a terrorist care so much about the past ? Maybe he thought he could change it . Hiro nakamura can stop time . Teleport by folding space . Theoretically , he can fold time as well . so you 're saying he 's a time traveler . Is that any stranger than being able to read someone 's mind ? Yeah , it is . Haven 't you ever wished you could change the past ? Set your life down a different path ? I used to be that guy . Wishing it and making it happen are two different things . Not for nakamura it isn 'T . Look here . These two dates seem to be the focal points . Both in the past . The first is the bomb . The other- - what ? What is it ? The other 's the day I received my father 's ashes . I was with peter petrelli that day . On the subway , he said he saw a man who could freeze time . Nakamura ? I don 't know . He said he had a message for peter . What ? What was the message ? Hey ! What was the message ? Save the cheerleader ... save the world . All right , here are you chilequiles and your waffle platter . Now just holler at me if y 'all need anything else.Okay ? right now we 're watching live footage of the president approaching marine 1 for his trip to his home state , new york . The white house promises a major policy shift ... you know , sandra , for a girl who 's supposed to hate the president , you sure do perk up whenever he 's on . A guy could get jealous . He 's old enough to be my father . Hey , so what did you think of rafferty 's ? For the reception . You were supposed to check it out , remember ? I 'm sorry.I forgot . You 're not getting cold feet , are you ? No , of course not . My feet are very warm . Two pairs of socks warm . Well , good . 'Cause I 'm kind of crazy about you . You know that . The creepy guy with glasses is back . Sitting in your section again.There we go . Thanks . Would you like a scoop of ice cream on that ? Um , no , not today , thank you . But my table 's a little sticky . Someone knows about you , claire . You need to leave as soon as possible . There 's a bag on the chair to my right . Leave ? What am I supposed to tell andy ? Tell him nothing.Just go . I can 't do that to him . We 're getting married . Have you told him ? No.All I want is a normal life , dad . I 've done my best to provide that for you . But people are starting to ask questions . Now I am trying to control the information , but it 's not safe here anymore . I 've been hiding for five years . California , nevada . I brought you back to midland . Only after mom left . this word just coming in.We have breaking news ... I just want you to be safe . ... Where enforcement agents have just bravely rounded up over 200 undocumented individuals as part of a coordinated nationwide sweep . This has been cited as the department 's most successful operation since the linderman act was passed four years ago . Homeland security spokesmen praised the near-perfect execution of local police , citing zero casualties on the enforcement side ... enjoy your pie . Officials were also sure to note that community tips ... the incident resulted in the safe transport of suspects to special holding facilities within their states , where the individuals will meet with federally provided attorneys to discuss their legal options . And a note to our viewers . If you see any suspicious activity , please ... D.L.Can phase inside the buildings . Candice 's illusion can distract the guards . Hey , what about me ? You 'll help too . That 's not what I meant . What happened to me ? Where am I ? Am I rich ? Married ? I can 't tell you that . Why not ? Because . So ... my friend is still in there . There 's something I need to tell you . We already caught you . Two hiros.Son of a bitch ! He really can travel through time . Unh ! What ? Your friends got away . If they were my friends , I wouldn 't have called you , matt . Yeah , thanks for the heads up . That 's the deal , right ? I turn you on to the dangerous refugees , and you let me help the harmless ones . Doesn 't hurt that we 're both harboring children of interest . Of course , mine isn 't the president 's daughter . She 's getting married . Mazel-tov . I guess . Have you , uh ... you heard anything from janice ? You ever wish you did something different ? Wish you took a different path ? Every day . You did right by her , matt . You did right by him . Thanks . I really appreciate all you 've done for them . What are you doing ? ! I 'm ending our arrangement . Unfortunately , I have to explain to the president that there 's a second hiro nakamura out there . Then I gotta tell him how I let him get away . See , I can 't come back empty handed . Now tell me where she is . No . Let 's elope . What ? Let 's elope.Right now , run away . I 'm thinking vegas . We 'll pack our bags.Get hitched tonight . Take off , see the world . What do you think ? I think you 're crazy . Maybe.Probably. Hmm.But I 've got my reasons . And I promise I 'll tell you everything . Will you do it ? For me ? I 'll do anything for you . Let me get my things . Okay . Coffee ? Coffee ? Can I get something for you , sir ? I don 't know , claire . What 's good ? Save the cheerleader , save the world . What does that mean ? How do you know that ? Five years ago , peter petrelli and i were on the subway . He said someone stopped time . That 's what you do , mr.Nakamura. Peter and I were on our way to see isaac mendez that day . An artist who can paint the future . A lot of his work is remarkably accurate . Except this . Is that a new 9th wonder ? the events in this comic . History didn 't happen like this . You didn 't kill sylar . You 're trying to change the past . Trying to stop sylar , is that it ? If you could save millions of lives , wouldn 't you ? Is that really you , ando ? Why are you so surprised to see me ? He didn 't tell you . What ? You 're ... dead . How ? In new york.The bomb . Really ? Do you remember how he used to be ? All full of hope and optimism ? of course . That 's the hiro I know . He went away the day you died . Between you and me , I think you 're the reason why he became so obsessed with trying to change it all back . He wants to save you . hey , baby , you in here ? Nakamura was trying to find a way to kill sylar before he exploded . You actually think he can make that happen ? I do . Think about it . Without sylar , the world would have never considered these people to be dangerous . None of this would 've ever happened . Imagine the possibilities . If he kills sylar , we can change the past . I don 't have that luxury . I need to find answers in the here and now . Genocide is not an answer . Is that what this is about ? You 're feeling bad because you came up short ? It 's wrong . I was elected to make hard decisions . I understand how things work . And how is this going to work ? Today I 'm going to announce that you 've developed a treatment to reverse this . You 're going to lie . The world will cheer . And what happens when people start dying ? I 'll say you made a mistake . A fatal error . At first , the world will mourn . They 'll be united in grief . And then they 'll just be united . Mohinder , I need to know if I can trust you . I need to know if you 're with me . Are you with me on this ? Of course . Mr.President. There are two of them , sir . Two ... hiros . - You 're sure ? - I am . I think we got the younger one . It explains the gaps in his knowledge . I want to put him down . No.I want dr.Suresh to do it . Yes , sir . Mr.President ... that 's not the only thing that I found in texas . I thought you were dead . You have no idea how important you are to me , claire . I 'm not important . I 'm just a waitress . We both know that isn 't true . You made everyone afraid of us . I made everyone aware of us . Fear is just the natural response . You can 't blame them , really . We 're more powerful than they are . More important . We 're special . Who are you to decide who 's special and who 's not ? I 'm the leader of the free world . For all I know , I 'm the most special person there is . Lord knows I found enough power . Met a lot of special people . Like this girl named candice who allowed me to become president . But I 'm done . I just want to eliminate the competition . I don 't need any more power . Especially not after you . Sylar . I 've waited a long time for this . You 've always wanted to become a kendo master . I studied in tohoku , so technically I 'm a battojutsu master . ... .. ... .. ... . ... .. ... ...... ... - Remember what we promised each other ? - Yeah , I remember . Then why can 't you just let it go ? Hey , I 'm not the one who can 't let go . You gonna call yourself jessica on stage night after night and act like nothing gets to you ? We both know that 's not true . That is not who you are . It is now . You 're gonna look in that mirror , but nobody is looking back but you . She is gone , niki.D.L.Is gone . Micah is gone . You have to accept your loss . Jessica was right all along . Look out for yourself . - Don 't get attached . - I don 't buy it . Then why are you in such a hurry to leave me ? My own reasons.And I 'm not leaving anything . - I 'll be back . - What reasons ? What makes you think that you are so important ? That you have to fix everything ? - Because I do . - Why ? Why does it fall on your shoulders to save everyone ? Because it was me ! The bomb ? It was me ! I killed all those people . I killed micah . No , it was sylar . - Everyone knows ! - It wasn 'T.Nathan lied . He lied to protect me . He told everybody that it was sylar . Think about it.You know me . You know what I can do . Listen , if there is a chance that hiro can undo this , I have to help him . You walk out that door , you don 't come back . - Is everything okay ? - No.Let 's go fix it . My fellow americans , fellow new yorkers , please let us take a moment to remember the men , women , and children who were taken from us five years ago . Five bells for the five years of sorrow . sacrifice ... is something that we 're all too familiar with . We 've all lost.We 've all mourned . And we 've all had to become soldiers , heroes . Protecting one another from the gravest of dangers . This is a battle that none of us wanted . One that we entered with a heavy heart . - Should we freeze time ? - No , I haven 't had a good fight in years . knowing that the enemy was ourselves . We 've won battles the world over . Not only against those that would do us harm , but against poverty , reclaiming the environment ... upstairs our powers will be blocked by the haitian . we need to take him out so the other hiro can teleport out of here . But there are guards up there . Won 't they be waiting for us with guns ? but we do not forget the price that we 've had to pay . The laws that we 've had to pass to keep our citizens safe . Put ' em all down.No warning . to preserve our way of life . Our hope has always been that a great peace is on the horizon . That one day wounds would be healed and salvation could be found . I 'm here to tell you that that day is today . I 'm proud to announce that we have developed a treatment , a method to reverse the genetic code . The first clinics will open next month across the world.And soon , we can begin lifting restrictions . Cities and families can be reunited . And we can finally live without fear . We 've been vigilant . We have been uncompromising . And our efforts have paid off . The nightmare is over . The world is saved . Why are we waiting , sir ? - Why can 't we just bring the fight to them ? - Because we 'd lose . The haitian 's up here , so up here , they 're powerless . Weapons free.Shoot on sight . I must go back to stop explosion . - You know I 'm telling truth . - Hold him down . Please don 't do this ! I 'm sorry . You 're letting me go.Why ? I think I 'm supposed to . I 'll take you where it 's safe . So you can change all this . No , future me ! He 's good guy ! - Mohinder . - Peter ? - Mohinder - Peter ? - Hiro ! - Ando ! You need to go back now . But how do I return to the right moment ? - I don 't know how to do that . - I 'll take you . Come on , come on , come on , move it ! Move it ! Sir . The haitian 's down ! The haitian is down ! - What about nakamura ? - We can 't get to him , sir . Your brother is holding us off . If I don 't get reinforcements now , it 's all over , sir.Nakamura will escape . Mr.President ? Mr.Pres- - come on ! Bust the door ! I 'm dead . We need to get out here . - I 'm dead . - Hiro . Get in there , parkman.End this . Sir . Move it ! Brother versus brother . It 's almost biblical . My brother can 't walk through walls.Who are you ? An old friend . The guy they blame for blowing up new york , but you and I know the real story , don 't we , pete ? Come on , do it ! You must leave . Now ! You 're gonna pay for what you did to nathan . - What you did in his name . - What I did ? When I killed nathan , he had already turned against his own kind . Liar . We must teleport back to our time ! I can 't . Hiro ! I believe in you ... I 've seen the man that you become . You can do this . Now the hard part ...

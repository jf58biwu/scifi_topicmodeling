 Torchwood . Outside the Government , beyond the Police . Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes , and you 've got to be ready . Diane Holmes , pilot . Please , don 't go . Come on . Aaargh ! I didn 't want saving . This programme contains some strong language . CAR HORN BEEPS TOSH SPEAKS JAPANESE It 's my grandfather 's 88th birthday today . I thought you 'd done this for me . 88 is a joyous year for the Japanese . I 'm off to London to watch men throw rice . You get that in the Balti after stop-tap . OK , down to business . What have we got ? The Ritz Dancehall . It 's been derelict since 1989 but someone 's complained about hearing music ... music from the 1940s . Shhh ! Listen . MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY You coming up ? WINGS FLAP Wow ! Look at the chandelier . No neon lights back then . Just dashing young soldiers and pretty young ladies . And as they danced , the girls would look into their partners ' eyes , smile softly and say ... Jack ! Mind my laptop . I was thinking more along the lines of , " How long before you head off to war ? " MACHINE BEEPS Come on . There 's nothing here but memories and dust . BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS VOICES CHAT AND LAUGH They look so real . They 're not ghosts . It 's a simple temporal shift . And it 's beautiful ! We should get out . Do call again . I would love to . It 's night ! Where 's the SUV ? Has it been stolen ? No . We have . ALARM BEEPS What the hell is that ? Tosh 's rift monitor programme . She set it to alert me if there were any further movements . The rift 's been opening more and more recently . Yeah , well , I 've noticed that . Doesn 't take a genius . Tosh reckons the equations are forming a pattern . I should call her . She may have readings her end and this is over my head . Um , why wasn 't I told about this ? Well , you 've been off , haven 't you ? The line 's dead . It 's no use . It 's dead . I can 't get through to the Hub . Let 's get back inside . That 's where we were when we crossed . 'Gwen , can you get down to Sage Street ? ' Yep . What 's up ? ' We need Tosh . ' The rift monitor sounded . She 's with Jack but their phones are dead and we can 't access her files . 'OK , I 'll get down there now ' . We really are in 1941 . What if we can 't get back ? Flotsam and jetsam slips through all the time . We 'll get back . Look on the bright side . Gives you one hell of an excuse for your party . I have a life there . And they can 't help us because I have the latest readings in here . People are staring at us . We need to try to blend in . It 's easy for you to say . I 'm the only Asian here . Don 't worry . You 're with the Captain . Hey . I 've got into Tosh 's files , all her reports . See there , December 24th . That 's when Diane flew through the rift . I had to let her go . You were in love with her , weren 't you ? If Tosh knows a way of opening the rift , maybe we can get Diane back . Jack would never allow it . Opening the rift could devastate the city . # My love is true # And just for you # I would do most anything at any time ... # Water , please , and a brandy . I haven 't seen you in here before . Three and six , please , sir . I 'll , er ... get them . Thank you . On one condition . What ? # Come to me , my melancholy baby ... # Why 's George dancing with a Jap ? The SUV 's here . They must be here somewhere . Jack ? Tosh ! MUSIC DRIFTS DOWN Jack ! # Come to me , my melancholy ... # Do you mind ? I 'm only borrowing her , mate . Maybe she doesn 't want to be borrowed . You want to make something of it ? You can always dance with me . OK , I 'll lead . You follow . Come on , Tosh . CROWD GASP Jack ! Jack , we 're meant to be blending in . Cut it out , kiddo . Sorry about that . The men are a bit lively tonight . It 's last day of OTU tomorrow . Apologise to the gentleman , George . I was only dancing . I think it was your fist he didn 't like , not your foxtrot . I 'm sorry . It 's OK . You barely got me . I think the lady also deserves an apology . I 'm sorry . Apology accepted . Let 's get a drink , George . Hey , are you a volunteer too ? Yeah . BOTH SPEAK AT ONCE : I 'm Captain ... You go first . I 'm Captain Jack Harkness . 133rd Squadron . Look this way , please . Right , the Ritz Dancehall , opened in 1932 , shut down in 1989 . Due to be demolished in one week . Now , the reported music is from the 1940s . Why is a ghost job taking them this long ? All those young soldiers ... Owen , look . There . One more for the record , sir . I insist . Thank you , gentlemen . I should be heading off .. Hey , I didn 't catch your names . Toshiko Sato . I 'm Captain James Harper . 71st . 71st , that 's where I 'm hoping to be posted . What 's your poison ? Maybe later . My friend and I were in the middle of something . Sure . Why does that man have your name ? I 'm lost enough here without you holding back on me ! It 's not my name . It 's his . I took his . But I didn 't realise he was ... so hot ! Jack ! I know too much . Then ... share . You wouldn 't want that . Trust me . We have to get back . What 's in here ? I 've got half the equation in here . The other half 's back at the Hub . If I can find some way of getting these figures back to base , they can combine them , open the rift and bring us back through . Come on . I heard music earlier . If I can hear them , maybe they can hear me . They 've got to come back . WINGS FLAP OVERHEAD Jack ! Tosh ! What ? I thought I heard my name . OK , so we use Tosh 's information to open the rift and bring them back . We can 't . Half the equation 's missing . It can 't be . It must be somewhere else . Let me try . It 's not there . It might be in her laptop . Which she never goes anywhere without . Shit . Shit ! No-one here . Come on , quick . It works ! LAPTOP : ' Your battery is running low ' . Just take down everything , in case it dies . I 'm not used to writing with these things ! Don 't press so hard . Oh , no . LAPTOP : ' Your battery is low . ' Can you read that ? Plus one over five a ... sine two eight X. LAPTOP : ' Your battery ... ' You got everything you need ? I just need the coordinates of the hall , so I can integrate them into the equation . Then we need to get the information back to the Hub . What are you doing in here ? Who are you ? Captain ... James Harper . And this is Toshiko Sato , friend and mathematician . I 'm Bilis , the manager . You 're not in full uniform , Captain . On leave . 48 hours . That 's an interesting camera . It takes photographs instantly . I didn 't know they could do that yet . And I didn 't know they made an attache case out of metal . CLOCK CHIMES Where did you get it ? London . I 'm from there . I should go back , dear . They 're coming for us now . I 've had a good look around but the doors were locked . MUSIC RESUMES INSIDE Can I help you ? I 'm the caretaker . Bilis Manger , at your service . Hello . Could you open it all up for me ? I think some of my friends got locked in . Follow me . Thank you . Pearl Harbour , Jack . Doesn 't happen till the end of the year . Granddad stayed in London but he was persecuted . If I stay here , what will happen ? I 'll take care of you . This period , you look like you fit in . Have you been here before ? Yeah . I can 't explain but I served in the war in 1941 . I was undercover . I needed a false identity , so I took ... his name . Who were you before you took his name ? Why him ? It was convenient . But if you chose his identity to steal , then he ... ? Dies , in battle . When ? Tomorrow . And I say , " Look , love , it 's raining bombs and fire , so get down that cellar . " And she says , " I can 't , there 's rats down there ! " So , who 's the best navigator here ? Tim . He can 't fly for toffee , but at least when he goes down , he 'll know exactly where he is . Why don 't we chat over here ? HE WOLF-WHISTLES I give the public schoolboy a fortnight . That boy 's come a long way in five weeks . As long as you boys remember your training , you 'll be all right . Glad you came . Shall we sit down ? Why were your friends in here , anyway ? Just a silly dare . Someone said it was haunted . You look worried , dear . I 'll make you a nice cup of tea . The sun rose this morning at 08.12 , 21 by 7 degrees . I note it down every day . It 's a bit silly , I suppose . It 's fantastic . You must have seen some action . Let 's just say the enemy comes in many guises . Yeah , I can 't wait to give Jerry what for . How many did you kill in the Battle of Britain , sir ? 26 , wasn 't it ? You 've read that story countless times . No-one 's as fast as him . Hasn 't lost a man yet . Care for a drink , Captain ? I 'll just have water , thanks . All right . Hello , Jack . I know you 're having a night with the men but I thought I 'd look in , if that 's all right . Yeah . Good to see you . Is anyone expecting you ? Yes . Perhaps you should call them , otherwise they may think you 've disappeared too . I 'll put the kettle on . CLOCK CHIMES Anything your end ? There are no more photographs of Jack and Tosh after that night . That 's encouraging . Yeah , unless the bombs got ' em . The manager , Bilis Manger , kept them for posterity . Bilis Manger ? That 's the name of the caretaker . Can 't be the same guy , can it ? Not old enough . But he does look a bit out of his time . He wears a cravat . Gwen , he 's in the photo with Jack and Tosh . He 's the answer . He came through the rift . Find out what he 's doing . No . Get out , Gwen . Wait for backup . We can 't lose him . Nor Gwen ! Maybe this is a trap . He could be sucking us back through time one by one . Get out of there , Gwen . I 'm sorry but who put you in charge ? I 've got what I need . Now all I have to do is find a way to leave a message for the team on something that will last across time . OK . I haven 't seen you two here before . Is she with you ? Nah , she 's after Tim . Why else would she let him bore her to death about navigation ? Maybe she 's a spy . The Chinese are on our side , aren 't they ? I 'm Japanese . You 're hardly an ally , then . Leave it , Audrey . So whose side are you on ? What 's in the bag ? Nothing . If you 've got nothing to hide , open the bag ! She can 't . Her work is top secret . She 's a decoder for the Brits . Without her , we 'd have no way of defending the country . To Toshiko . Toshiko ! I need Bilis 's camera . Photographs last , don 't they ? Sure you don 't want me to come with you ? Oh , you can 't run out on me . I 've just got you a drink . I 'm fine . You carry on . To a fellow captain . So , what brings you down here ? I had to rest up . Injured my back bailing over Kent . That 's his excuse for not dancing . Mind if I join you ? Sure . Why not ? Starting to be a habit . I just wanted to try it out . This little beauty is very unusual and rare , not unlike yourself . Don 't go without this . I could think of better things to photograph than numbers , my dear . Do call again . What are you doing ? Owen ! We haven 't got the missing numbers . We 'll improvise with the Rift Manipulator . We can 't . It 's risky enough with the equation . If we don 't do it properly , anything can happen . Bombs are falling . They 're stuck in the middle of the Cardiff Blitz . It 's our duty to get ' em out . JACK 'S LAUGHTER ECHOES Jack ? Open the rift and the world could suffer . We could all get sucked in . Who knows what will come out ? This is about Diane ! When will you accept she chose to leave you ? Whereas your cyber-girlfriend stuck around . Not that she had a choice , wired in the cellar . That was different . Yeah . Mainly because Diane didn 't try and kill us and she also happened to be a human being . Stop it . Not some monster . I thought she was still Lisa . I loved her . You only knew Diane for a week . And it wasn 't enough . Maybe the Manipulator can calculate the missing figures . It isn 't working . Good . Jack would never have wanted us to use it this way . There 's a piece missing . We 've got to find it . Maybe you should go home . You don 't have any power over me . OK , Ianto , we 'll play it your way - safe and boring . BUG BAND TUNE FINISHES PEOPLE APPLAUD So , what 's your next mission ? Careless talk costs lives . I should go anyway . No , I didn 't mean that to ... It 's all right . I can get a lift if I leave now . I 'd better stay here . Aren 't you leaving tomorrow night ? You sick of us Welsh already ? Yeah , that 's why I 'm still fighting for you . I 'll be in touch when I 'm next on leave . Nancy ... it 's been a good few weeks . Was that it ? She 's a sweet kid , but I need to look after my men tonight . It 's their last day tomorrow . Go after her . Kiss her goodbye . Anything can happen tomorrow . It 's just a routine training exercise . I 'm hardly gonna die . That 's when they catch you , when you least expect it . You don 't know what 's ahead . Kiss her ... goodbye . Nancy ? I love you . That just made things 20 times worse . Now she thinks she 's in love with me . Hey , her falling for you is hardly my fault . Play it coo in front of your men , but not me . It 's OK to be scared . A captain has to keep his head . A captain needs to explain risks , tell his men what to expect . So what do I do ? Tell ' em I saw a young boy get shot in the eyes mid-flight ? I understand . Do you ? Did you hear him on the radio , yelling for his mom , while the Messerschmitts shot him blew his plane apart ? All I can hear on the radio ... Is screams . I went to war when I was a boy . I was with my best friend . We got caught crossing the border over enemy lines . They tortured him because he was weaker . They made me watch him die . And they let me go . Who were they ? The worst possible creatures you can imagine . I persuaded him to join up . I said it would be an adventure . He hadn 't lived . Have any of us ? OK , team ... I hope you like treasure hunts . No sign of Bilis leaving the area . Er , where are you off to ? The dancehall . Bilis 's office . He must know how the rift works . Maybe we 'll find a clue there . What would Jack and Tosh do ? How would they try and help us ? Bilis ! I need more equations , Gwen . What happened here , Tosh ? No . AIR RAID SIREN WAILS BOMB WHISTLES THROUGH AIR THEY SCREAM Toshiko ! Toshiko ! Jack ! This way ! I didn 't get the first part in the photo . The rest is outside . If they find it , they 'll keep looking , won 't they ? Yeah . IANTO : ' Be careful , Gwen . Bilis is still around ' . Owen , where are you ? ' I 'm in the building . Where 's Bilis 's office ? ' It 's at the far end of the corridor . I 'll keep looking out here . Yes ! BOMBS BOOM OVERHEAD Thing is , you could be the last girl I ever kiss . I 've got to finish the message . Pencil will fade . I need to find something else . Airtight . This 'll do . # There 'll be bluebirds over # The white cliffs of Dover # Tomorrow # Just you wait and see ... # OK . Shit ! CLOCK CHIMES ALARM CLOCK BEEPS Timepieces . I didn 't find any equations . Um , I 'll get back to the Hub . I 'll keep looking here , then . Yeah , you do that . Yes . Of course I 'm scared . I 'm going to check everywhere for the other figures . I 'm not going to leave Jack now . # There 'll be bluebirds over ... # SONG FADES ALL-CLEAR SIGNAL WAILS Let the dancing continue ! ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD I 've finished . The rest of the equation is hidden . What happened ? I slipped . I 've got a first-aid kit in the van . Scotch , Captain ? I 'd like some time in private with Captain Harper . Ianto ? Yeah , it 's me . I 've found it . It 's written in blood . Gwen 's found the rest of Tosh 's readings . What 's she got for us ? Cos sine squared , axcx = x over 2 . No , I need at least three more numbers , Gwen . They must be somewhere else . 'No , they 're not ' . Well , how do you know ? Somebody scraped out the final numbers . Tosh has written a message at the end . It says , " Tell my family I love them . " Why did you make me kiss her goodbye ? I just think you should live every night like it 's your last . Make tonight the best night of your life . You 're alive - right here , right now . Your men are fine . What are you trying to say ? Go to her . Go to your woman and lose yourself in her . Maybe I should . Yeah . Is Toshiko your woman ? No . There 's no-one . Go to her . It still won 't work . There 's a piece missing . Bilis had it all along . We still don 't have all the equation . Maybe the machine can work it out . MACHINE BURSTS INTO LIFE Owen ! MACHINE ENGINE SPLUTTERS OUT There must be something in the safe . We need better instructions . You can 't open it . You 've no right . I 'm second in command . I have got every fucking right . There 's stuff we don 't know about . That 's how Jack likes it . I won 't play with his toys , Ianto ! " Rhea Silva , the god of war 's missus . " And a nine-digit number . Not so clever , Jack . Blueprints for the Rift machine . I thought you 'd gone . This could be your last chance . That 's why I came back . I might have to leave before the night is over . Well , then make the most of now . WOMAN LAUGHS We need lovers ' corner , if you don 't mind , boys . Of course . I was just discussing strategies with the captain . We 'll go somewhere else . No . You 've told me all I need to know . There 's instructions in here . This isn 't a random act of madness . It 's a trap ! Bilis wanted you to find it . Why ? To provoke the rift . To incite total chaos and destruction . All the reports of the haunted dancehall were anonymous . What if it was him ? Please , listen to me ! I 'm tired of being in awe of the rift . I 'm tired of living with Jack 's secrets . We don 't even know who he is . He 's our leader . Not any more . Get out of my way . Ianto ! Ugh ! Tomorrow is their last training exercise , just another day . They go out on a sortie and are surprised by two formations of Messerschmitts . He destroys three of the enemy . His men listen to his whoops of joy over the radio . Then it all goes quiet . He can 't bail out because his whole plane is on fire . But his men all make it back to safety . Put the key down . Or I 'll shoot . Who were you ? A conman . That 's why I took his name , falsified his records so it seemed he was still alive . How did you end up in Torchwood ? Someone saved my life . Brought me back from death . And ever since then , it 's been like they 're keeping me for something and I don 't know what it is . I 'm sorry for dragging you into this . It was my choice . I 'll look after you . But there 's nothing I can do for him . You have to let Diane go . Like I did with Lisa . Don 't compare yourself to me . You 're just a tea boy . I 'm much more than that . Jack needs me . In your dreams , Ianto . In your sad wet dreams when you 're his part-time shag , maybe . That rift took my lover and my captain . So if I die trying to beat it , then it will all be in the line of duty . Aaargh ! MACHINE STARTS UP You don 't know what you 've done . # That certain night # The night we met # There was magic abroad in the air # There were angels dancing at the Ritz # And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square ... # # .. I may be right # I may be wrong ... # What 's he doing ? # .. But I 'm perfectly willing to swear ... # RIFT BLASTS OPEN Jack ! Jack , we need to get out ! Jack , you have to ! We need you ! I have to go . It 's my duty . Oh , you made it ! You made it ! You made it . Oh , Tosh , come here , come here , come here ! I 'm fine ! GWEN LAUGHS I knew we did the right thing , opening the rift . Still no sign of Bilis . World didn 't end after all , did it ? Good job you 're a crap shot . I was aiming for your shoulder . It was wartime , I know , but it was beautiful . There were angels dancing at the Ritz . - Jack ... - Let me . He would have been so proud that you took his name . Because here you are , saving the world . To Captain Jack . To Captain Jack . You know it 's rude to stare . I thought telepathy would get you to make me a cuppa . What 's it worth ? What do you want ? I 'll draw you a diagram , shall I ? Nice arse ! MOBILE RINGS Don 't answer it ! Yep . JACK : ' You watching the news ? ' TV : ' There 's speculation that the incidents overnight may be linked . 'Initial reports suggested terrorist involvement ' . 'But some intelligence experts have claimed the incidents may be stunts . 'The first sightings were of UFOs over the Taj Mahal in India . 'They came in just after midnight . 'In London this morning , men in historic dress fired upon police . 'Some religious groups are claiming events overnight 'are a vindication of their teachings . ' Do you think it is terrorists ? Terrorists bomb things . This is different . People didn 't believe us . Now they should . Judgment day is finally here . This is the End of Days . " And I heard but did not understand and I said , ' Master , what is the End of all these things ? ' And he said , " ' Go , Daniel , for the things are closed up and sealed until the end of time . ' " Daniel 12 , verse 10 . Sounds a bit close for comfort . This machine 's on the blink . Keeps losing power . Sorry , don 't let me stop your portents of doom . Or have you finished ? No . More where that came from . Abaddon , the Great Devourer , who 'll lead the world into shadow . Thanks , Ianto , no superstition . You people love any story that denies the randomness of existence . Thanks . That makes me feel better . OK , I 've been fielding calls . The government , UNIT , the CIA ... Half the world are asking one question . Is this anything to do with us ? And is it ? I 've run a profile on every reported temporal anomaly and tracked any physical or temporal pattern . Shit ! The cracks in time trace back here to the rift . This city , this Hub , is the centre . What you 're seeing around the world are ripples and aftershocks . The rift is splintering because of you . What ? You opened it without knowing what you were doing . You 've caused the temporal cracks to widen . Time is seeping through . If it wasn 't for me , you two would still be in the 1940s . So are we going to sit around crying into our lattes , or shall we do something about it ? Bring those who 've fallen through time back here , into the vaults . And do what with them ? We 'll deal with phase one , then phase two . You can 't control time . What are you gonna do ? We 'll think of something ! Hey , this is not the end of the world . I 'm certain of that . COMPUTER BEEPS Priority one attendance - hospital . Mortality rate 's through the roof . They 're designating a hot zone . I 'll go . Tosh , go with him . No , thanks , I 'm fine on my own . And you 'll be even better with me alongside . Shut up and come on . Did you have to pick on him in public like that ? All our actions have consequences . And all your staff have feelings , Jack , even Owen . Well , you 'd know . He brought you back . Would you rather be stuck in World War II ? Hello . 'Gwen , it 's Andy ' . Listen , I didn 't know who else to call . MAN SHOUTS IN LATIN Double murder . Stabbed two blokes in Penarth . Brutal , it was . No mercy . What are we supposed to do ? He doesn 't speak a word of English , and he 's dressed as a Roman soldier ! He 's not , he IS a Roman soldier and he 's shouting in Latin . Only word I could pick out was Gelligaer . Gelligaer . There 's a Roman fort out at Gelligaer . Built around 75AD . He was on his way , time splintered , he ends up here . Excuse me ? Hi . Any time you feel like talking sense ... That soldier came through a crack in time . He 's not serious , is he ? This sort of thing just doesn 't happen . Not in Cardiff . Just cos you can 't understand , doesn 't mean it isn 't true . I know it sounds mad , Andy ... All right , Mulder and Scully . Say I do believe you , which I don 't , cos it 's bollocks . How exactly are we meant to handle a prisoner from 2,000 years ago ? Has he got the same rights as anyone ? How 's this gonna work with the CPS ? We 'll take him off your hands . HE SHOUTS IN LATIN Under any other circumstances , an exuberant Roman soldier would be my idea of a perfect morning . Careful , Jack . PRISONER STOPS SHOUTING Everyone 's saying it , you know . In work , on the streets . Do you think this is the end of the world ? Oh , Andy , don 't be silly . Do you think the world 's gonna end on your shift ? I 've seen you use that smile on a lot of people . What smile ? The smile you use to reassure people when everything 's gone to shit . This was the first one to die . NO ID on her . She just appeared in the middle of AE . Nobody saw her come in , she didn 't register at the desk . So what happened ? She started coughing up blood . We moved her into isolation . An hour later , the staff presented similar symptoms . Which were ? Bite-like bumps , chills , fever , headaches , along with black patches on the skin . Indicating bleeding into the skin and possibly other organs . From the staff , it spread to patients who 'd been in reception . These aren 't contemporary clothes . Her teeth aren 't modern , either . Shit . As soon as we realised the rate of infection , we closed down . How many others are infected ? 30 , maybe 40 . All quarantined off ? We think so . Have their clothes and sheets destroyed . What is it ? That woman isn 't from this century . More like the 14th . It 's the ... it 's the fucking ... Black Death , Tosh . She 's infected Cardiff AE with the plague ... and it 's my fault . The team are instigating procedures . The infected will need 30 milligrams of Streptomycin and Chloramphenicol plus two of Tetracycline . That 's plague medicine . Standard issue for bubonic . Well done , House . That 's what you 're up against . So what are you gonna do now ? Well , you 've got procedures , haven 't you ? Yes , but everybody said Torchwood would sort it out . What if we get more carriers appearing ? We 're working to stop that . We waited for you ! You 've got to stop this ! You 've gotta do something ! No , you 've gotta do something . People are dropping through time and they 'll bring every disease in history through your doors . So you 'd better be ready . Owen ... You scared enough yet ? Cos fuck knows I am ! Come on , Tosh ! Make sure they get the medicine . Call us if things get worse . How much worse can they get ? Owen ? Owen ! Okasan ? SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE TOSH REPLIES IN JAPANESE Tosh ! Come on , stop pissing about . If Owen managed to open the rift to get you and Tosh back , can 't we do the same thing for these people ? We 've got the rift manipulator . There 's a world of difference . We 're talking about taking control of time , not bringing two people back from the past . Besides , look at the damage Owen caused . We mess with it further , we 'll put the planet in danger . Have I ever let you down ? Gwen ? Gwen ? 'I 'm sorry . ' 'I 'm so sorry . ' Gwen ? Gwen ! Come on . Hustle ! Are you sure it was the same guy ? It was definitely him . Bilis , the caretaker of the dancehall . That 's all he said , sorry ? What 's he got to be sorry for ? Coming through ! WEEVIL GROWLS 13 more reports of Weevils . We can 't keep up at this rate . Everything 's on the increase . Can you stop them making that noise ? If you 've got any ideas how . Maybe they 're time sensitive . It 's too much . We 're now full in all vaults across all nine levels . Do you want me to activate the vaults below ? We 've never used them since I 've been here . Do it . Gwen , maybe you 're right . Let 's run a search on your dancehall buddy . We need to find him . OK . WEEVIL MOANS Hello , Ianto . What do you want ? Why are you here ? This isn 't happening . There 's only one way to stop this , before things get worse . People will die , Ianto . Thousands of people . Unless you open the rift . Owen . How was the hospital ? Laugh a bloody minute . They 've got an outbreak of the Black Death . What ? Oh , my God ! Have they got it under control ? Tosh ! How are they coping ? Um , Owen got the place quarantined and organised treatments for those who 've been infected . Only consolation is , it 's treatable . But what happens when the next carrier comes through , Jack ? Someone carrying smallpox or Ebola , or something from the future ? What do we do then ? Well , it 's not doing us any good speculating . We need to be prepared . We 're helpless . We 're putting sticking plasters on gaping wounds ! What do you suggest ? I suggest you lead us and you tell us what the instructions are . Owen ... No , come on . You 're all thinking it too . You 're the big man here . You keep all the secrets . Well , now 's the time to tell us how the hell we 'll get out of this ! You want to know a secret ? There is no solution . I can 't fix this . Because this was never meant to happen . The first thing you learned was don 't mess with the rift . But you disobeyed those orders . And now everything that 's happening is down to you . I only disobeyed to get you back . And now people are dying . So I shouldn 't have bothered ? Who the fuck are you , anyway ? Jack Harkness ? You don 't even exist . We 've looked . So if you 're not even a real person , then why should I follow your orders ? Get out . What ? Get out ! I 'm relieving you of your duty . No . You can 't do that ! Bollocks , you are ! Jack , wait . You 're done here . What , so that 's it ? The whole world is going to shit and you 're going to fire me ? For God 's sake ! Both of you ! We need to stick together on this . If I can 't rely on you , if I don 't have your complete trust , you don 't belong here . That goes for the rest of you . Anyone who agrees with Owen , leave now . So now we know how it is . So that leaves me 24 hours to savour the good times . What are you talking about ? Think about it , Gwen . Nobody leaves this place intact . Sometime in the next 24 hours ... I get Retconned . All my memories erased . I don 't know where or when , but he 'll get me . Jack , this has gone far enough . So I guess this is goodbye . Good luck with the end of the world . I would say thanks for the memories ... Jack , for God 's sake ! 'OK , guys , Bilis 's shop is coming up 20 metres on your left ' . Wow . Some of this stuff must go back centuries . He scavenges antique pieces from the past , brings them here , sells them for a profit . Not a bad business plan . We all have to earn a living . You 're from 1941 . As you were . Hello , again . How can you be in two time zones at once ? I can step across eras , like you 'd walk into another room . At first , it was the most incredible gift . Now I know the reality ... it 's a curse . Why ? I can see the whole of history , but I don 't belong anywhere within it . So , your return to this time had a price . Time 's splintering . This city exists on a rift in time . The only way to make it right is to fully open that rift - let it suck back what fell through . No way . It 's too dangerous . Can we even do that ? Of course you can . Isn 't that right , Captain ? Jack ? You 've seen what happened . If we open that rift fully , millions of lives will be at risk . And yet , if you don 't , more will fall through . Lives will be lost . You know so much , you 're coming back with us . I 'm sorry . Damn it ! Trace the temporal activity around this location . We need to find out where he is . Come on . CLOCKS CHIME Gwen . I am not your enemy . In the cells , why did you say you were sorry ? Sometimes it 's better to live in ignorance ... unless ... Do you really want to know ? Know what ? Hold my hands . I 'll show you . OK . Only if you 're sure . I 'm sure . I 'm sorry ! What did you just show me ? The future . What took you so long ? Gwen ? Gwen ! Is that you ? Yeah ... It 's me . Ah ! You 're cleaning the oven ! Aye , somebody got to , love . Listen , we gotta go . Why , what 's happened ? We 've gotta go . Let me finish here first ... Rhys , we 've gotta go . Now ! Aw , here we go again , always a hurry since you started that bloody job ... I 'm sorry . ( Owen . ) Owen . Oh ... Jesus . Diane ... Oh , Jesus . I 'm lost , Owen . I can touch you . I don 't understand . Where did you end up ? Please . Bring me back , Owen . You can do that , can 't you ? I don 't know . Everything 's out of sync . Please . Please bring me back . Open the rift . Do you want another drink there , mate ? # Can it call you or maul you # And drive you insane # Can it make you remember # Time is in place # Now I 'm begging you # I 'm begging you ... # Take it easy . What 's going on ? Am I dreaming ? This is where I work . You work in a prison ? These are just the cells . You locked me in a cell ? What the hell are you playing at ? I was just trying to keep you safe . I was safe at home ! No , you weren 't . You really weren 't . Listen , Gwen , you 'd better tell me exactly what 's going on cos I 've taken some shit over the past few months . What 's all this ? Rhys , listen to me , I need you to trust me . OK , it may not seem like it at the moment , but I 'm just trying to take care of you . I love you , sweetheart . LOUD MOAN FROM ABOVE What the hell was that ? Just try and relax and I 'll come back for you . What do you mean ? You 're not going to leave me down here ! I 'm sorry . Gwen ! Gwen ! I 'm sorry . Shit ! Did he wake up ? Yeah . Yeah , he did . Tosh , can you bring up the CCTV of the vaults ? Er , just leave it on the screen , I know it sounds crazy , but ... Sure , no problem . Thank you ... for helping me bring him here . I can 't understand how Bilis was able to show you that vision . It was so real , Tosh . I was in my flat . It smelt like my flat , it had all the sounds of my flat . I touched the blood . I can still feel it on my hands . Rhys 's blood . Not gonna happen . Come on , there 's still work to be done . What 's going on ? We 've got a security breach . All right , nobody panic . RHYS ! KLAXON SOUNDS Oh , do you work here ? I 'm Rhys ... .. Gwen 's boyfriend . RHYS GROANS NO ! No ! He 's gone ! He 's gone ! Please ... No ! Please ! No ! We can ... we can bring him back ! There 's nothing we can do . Yes , there is ! My boy . What am I going to do ? What am I going to do ? SHE SCREAMS No ! No ! GWEN 'S SCREAMS ECHO I 'll have to tell his family . We 'll deal with it . The way you dealt with that porter the first time I met you ? No , you won 't deal with him , Ianto . Gwen , I 'm so sorry . You never even met him . This is what happens here . We all end up alone . Not me . No way . You bring him back . No . The resurrection gauntlet ... Was destroyed . Something else . I said no . No , there 's something wrong with time , so we , we can go back to the moment , to the very moment ... Gwen ... There 's something you can do , otherwise WHAT 'S THE FUCKING POINT OF YOU ? ! You , you bring him back ! Bring him back ! You bring him back ! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME , JACK FUCKING HARKNESS ? I 'm sorry . Do you ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . Oh , shit . What happened ? You came back ! Are you all right ? You OK ? You all right ? Don 't touch me ! How many other people have got to suffer ? I 'm gonna fix this . I 'm opening the rift . Make sure you stop him . No . We 're gonna help him . Bilis was right , he said open the rift and everything goes back to normal . Owen 's right . I 'm going to get Rhys back . Gwen . No ! Gwen ! Enter Emergency Protocol One . Out the way , I 'll do this . ALARM SOUNDS Get away from the computer , Gwen . Jack ... This is a trap . All the cracks , they 're diversions . This is what Bilis wants . What are you afraid of , Jack ? Rhea Silva . I said , " Move . " What the hell are you doing ? ! Final warning . Come on , Jack . You 're a united front now ? Toshiko , the poor girl who 'll screw any passing alien that gives her a pendant ? Owen , so strong , he gets in a cage with a Weevil , desperate to be mauled . Or Ianto , hiding his cyber-girlfriend in the basement . Your three comrades here pumped bullets into her , remember ? I 've got to get Rhys back . Yeah , cos you 're so in love with Rhys that you spend half your time in Owen 's bed . Fuck you ! We 're relieving you of your command , " Captain " . We 're getting back what we lost ! Shit ! Stay down ! You 're in charge , Owen ? You 've gotta have significantly bigger balls . I 'm sick of people doubting me . What have you done ? We 've still got to do Jack 's . KLAXON BLARES SOLDIER SHOUTS GWEN SCREAMS Oh , my God ! What have you done ? Help me move him ! Keep moving ! It 's going to be all right , Jack . Everything is going to go back to normal . From out of the darkness , he is come . What is he talking about ? Son of the Great Beast , cast out before time , chained in rock and imprisoned beneath the rift . What ? ! All hail Abaddon , the Great Devourer . Come to feast on life . BEAST ROARS CAR ALARMS BLARE The whole world shall die beneath his shadow . PEOPLE SCREAM I look upon you , my God , and know my work is done . How do we stop it ? Tell me what to do , Jack . Just you ... Get me to an open space . What are you gonna do ? If Abaddon is the bringer of death , let 's see how he does with me . If he feeds on life , then I 'm an all-you-can-eat buffet . No , wait ! Wait , you 're too weak ! Get out of here ! GO ! Drive as fast as you can . Jack ! Bring it on ! ABADDON ROARS JACK SCREAMS GWEN SOBS You 're here ! Weren 't you just here a minute ago ? You 're here ! Go to bed . Get some sleep ... and I 'll be back for you . You 're certain ? He 's ice cold . No vital signs . He survived when you shot him . When I first joined , he said he couldn 't die . He was wrong . I want to sit with him . Gwen ... I want to sit with him . ( Wake up . ) ( Jack . ) How long 's she gonna do this ? It 's been days . We have to face up to it . He 's not coming back . I believe in him . Let him go , Gwen . JACK : Thank you . I ... I forgive you . OWEN SOBS What 's happened to the rift ? It closed up when Abaddon was destroyed . But it 's gonna be more volatile than ever . The visions we had . We all saw people we loved . What did you see ? Nothing . There was nothing . Jack ... what would have tempted you ? What visions would have convinced you to open the rift ? The right kind of Doctor . Jack ... ? Where are they with those coffees ? MACHINE BEEPS Jack ? TARDIS THRUMS Jack ?

 What does this mean to you ? I keep seeing it in my dreams , john . It means something . Weirdo . Kook . Nut . I 've been reading the dictionary . I don 't sleep . Whatever happened with the explosion flipped a switch . You don 't know what you 're about to do . I love you , john , and you love me . Your name is ? Riley . What 's the matter ? Never brought a girl home before ? No . Riley climbed out john 's window . Now is not the time for this . Well , when is the time ? You bring danger into riley 's life . And i 'm gonna keep seeing riley even if everyone thinks it 's a bad idea . I understand that it 's a bad idea . So don 't worry about it and be happy you 're a machine . I 'm a machine . I can 't be happy . Anything yet ? I 've dumped about 50,000 websites . There are hundreds of companies with three dots in the logo . Organic fruit . Candles . Dog collars . Baby wipes . Ice cream . Nothing screams skynet like baby wipes and ice cream . Keep looking . It is something you saw in a dream . And written in blood on the wall . So it means something . Will you just keep looking ? Tomorrow . I 'm beat . You never sleep . Make yourself useful . Most efficient killing machine ever invented . You got her doing laundry . You do never sleep . One glazed . One rainbow sprinkle . One cinnamon twist . You never forget , do you ? No , i don 't . So how was mexico ? Did you get to see your buddy down there ? Where 's the rest of it ? He was gone when we got there . After you went all that way ? Bummer . Yes . It was a bummer . Is your brother still seeing that crazy blonde ? Yes . It 's become a problem . She snuck out the window one night and left the alarm off . We got robbed . No way . Did you catch who did it ? Everything worked out fine . That 's a pretty zen attitude . " the robbed that smiles steals something from the thief . " You readothello . You asked me to . Did you like it ? It was more violent than i expected . I should 've warned you . No . Everything worked out fine . You 're not eating your donuts . Later . Do you havea history of california field artillery ? I 'm interested in the ancient muzzle-loading rifles used during the modoc indian war . Uh , in the california room . I 've a big week . Paper due on thursday . Peter the great 's war with the turks and the technological modernization of imperial russia . It 's better than it sounds . What are you lookin ' at ? Him . I know him . Not unless you 're about , oh , 110 years old . That photo 's from 1920 . See , december 31,1920 . What was he doing in 1920 ? What is this picture from ? Famous new year 's eve speakeasy fire during prohibition . 43 people died . There were rumors someone threw a molotov cocktail through the door . Lots of rivalries between the different speakeasy clubs . Over here . I need to know what happened to him . Hello . John , can you come get me ? Where ? What 's wrong ? At 341 grove way in van nuys . Can you please just come ? Most periodicals from the ' 20s haven 't been transferred to digital , so this could take awhile . But fire that big , there 's always survivor stories . Like with thetitanic . You know , there 's only one titanicsurvivor left , millvina dean . Course , she was only two months old when it happened so her story isn 't particularly instructive . You 're a very happy person . I am ? I don 't know that many happy people . Well , i guess that 's my own little survivor story . Of course , having bone cancer was like being thetitanic and the iceberg . So , uh , why do you want to find out about this guy ? I 'm interested in the past . It effects everything in the future . Those who don 't know history are destined to repeat it . Or die . What 's wrong ? Little cold in here . It 's 76 degrees . Check this one . D6 . That 's him . That 's the guy from the fire . Who 's that other man ? Rudolph valentino . The greatest silent film star of all time ? Ugh , you kids today with your rock and roll and your obsession with medieval siege weapons . Rudolph valentino and myron stark at the premiere ofthe sheik . What was stark doing there ? Living it up on the red carpet . I enjoyed your film very much , mr . Valentino . Thank you . Although i thought your decision to return the gun to lady diana to protect herself From the caravan of thieves was misguided given that she was a security risk . Stark is shaking hands with valentino . But look at his eye line . He 's looking at that man . " rupert chandler . " Check out that hat . We could search the city and county records for more on stark . Where are they ? Basement . Vital records . But it 's locked and i don 't have the keys . You 'll have to come back in the morning and talk with barry . 'Scuse me . Where are you going ? Hey , excuse me . Looking for someone ? Uh , yeah , riley . Blonde girl . Uh , i barely know mike 's friends . Uh , gail silver . Mike 's mom . Oh , hi . I 'm john . Let me help you with these . This is the wrong kind . You said " beer . " how come you never introduced me to your friend john ? 'Cause he 's not my friend . Some loner weirdo who dropped out of school . What are you doing here ? Just looking for somebody . And being helpful . You could learn a lesson from him . What , like sucking up to mom ? Is the tv in your room broken ? It 's kinda hard to relax when you 're out here . I gotcha . I 'm goin ' . I didn 't know you could just send your mom off to her room like that . So ? Who you lookin ' for ? Girl named riley . Oh , i know riley . Oh , got your beer ! Thanks . Okay , thanks . What are you doing ? You called me all upset . What--what 's goin ' on ? Oh , that--that was just- - this guy was bothering me , that 's all . Well , i have a car . Let 's go . No . It 's- - it 's cool now . Come on . We can hang out a little bit . Hang out ? I only came to get you . I 'm sorry . It 's cool . We can--we can--we can stay . Are you trying to get me fired ? No . Then what are you doin ' down here ? Looking for records on myron stark . I don 't think he was who everyone thinks he was . I let you in after hours whenever you want . And for you to go and do this , exactly what i tell you not to , really not cool . I need the information . And i need this job . You broke the lock . I 'll fix it . Just put it back . Put it all back . Don 't . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have gone down there . Forget it . It 's no big deal . Yes , it is . We 're friends . I don 't really have many friends . Actually , i don 't have any friends . You ? That--that can 't be true . So did you find anything out down there ? No . There 's no record of myron stark before the fire . Dead end . I don 't like dead ends . He could 've been an immigrant . Came through ellis island , shortened his name . Worked his way up from nothing . It 's the immigrant spirit . Single-minded pursuit of a goal . Never giving up . Buying into the american dream . An effective strategy . Either that or he robbed banks . What ? Can you show me police records ? Shortly after 2 : 00 pm , a lone robber held up the la brea savings and loan . Witnesses say the masked man armed with a thompson submachine gun And a daring disregard for human life opened fire . Eight citizens were felled and did not live to tell about it . This is the third bank robbed in this fashion in recent weeks . Detective , can you tell us how much was looted from the vault ? Over $ 70,000 in cash , silver , and liberty bonds . Was the robber injured in the fray ? Police let fly with a hail of bullets . The robber was hit with nearly 30 rounds , but escaped on foot . How in god 's name did he survive ? That has not been ascertained . A manhunt is underway . You really think he robbed banks ? It 's a very effective strategy . But why ? What did he need it for ? To buy into the american dream . Stark bought parcels of land in the san fernando valley , burbank , sunland , van nuys . Two days after the last heist . What 'd he do with all that land ? He built houses . I found this application for a business license . Construction . This is worldwide news . Myron stark versus rupert chandler . A classic david versus goliath . Real estate magnate and builder rupert chandler was the undisputed king of the expanding san fernando valley . But along came a young upstart , myron stark . What started as a one-man operation soon grew into a thriving business That went head to head with the largest builder in the county . It 's said stark spoke six languages , paid double the wages of his competitors , And treated all of his workers equally regardless of their employment history or citizen status . Stark himself could always be found shoulder to shoulder with his workers , A pickaxe in his strong hands . Soon stark company became a thorn in the side of his rival . His meteoric rise threatened to topple the " king chandler " from his throne . Chandler 's top foreman , fred jeffers , was recently asked about the rivalry . To hear jeffers tell it , " we 're not worried . " fly-by-nights like stark come and go . " chandler 's an established company with contracts " booked through 1925 . We 'll crush him like a bug . " Upon hearing jeffers ' fighting words , stark reported to reply simply , " we 'll see . " Here 's more on chandler and jeffers . And something really strange . Fred jeffers , rupert chandler 's man , went missing back in 1925 . Was never found . What is this ? A 17-round glock 9mm semiautomatic . Why do you have it ? In case i need it . Have you ever used it ? Yes . Are you in trouble ? No . Are you afraid of someone ? Afraid ? No . I 've seen cuts on your face . There was one last week . You were wearing makeup , but ... Sometimes i get into fights . Wh--why ? My brother . There are people out to hurt him . I protect him . Who protects you ? I do . Why are we doing this ? Why is myron stark so important ? He was doing something , and it doesn 't make sense to me . I need to find out what it was . None of this makes sense to me . Not you , not the gun , not the guy in the photograph . I know . I 've never fired a gun before . Do you want to ? Sure , but ... Wait . N--no . We can 't do this here . Grip it with both hands . Squeeze the trigger slowly . Slowly . Oh , yeah . Oh , my god . I 'm terrible at this . John . No , i don 't know how . What , you live in a cave ? Come on . What am i supposed to do ? I have no idea . I just pushed those buttons at random . And you sucked . Hey , check you out , mr . Normal . Kill him , alex . Come on , johnny . I 'm rooting for you . Dude , you suck . Hey , come on . Kill him , alex . I 'm gonna go . You stay here if you want . No , john , wait . This was a mistake . Well , i- - i 'm coming with you . You 're going ? With that weirdo ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . We have to go . Oh , no , no , no . Wait . Give me my lighter back . Your what ? You took my lighter . No . C--no . Come on , john . Let 's go . No , no , no . Give it to me . Give it to me , weirdo . Get off me . - Hey , hey , you leave her alone . - Hey , no one 's talking to you , weirdo . Don 't . Don 't . Stop . Come on . - Watch out , man . - Give it to me , you screwy bitch . John . Take the damn lighter . Come on , john . Let 's get out of here . I 'm out here on mulholland drive where a hiker has discovered What appears to be the body of a man who died over 60 years ago . Tom jacobs was out for an early morning walk when he spotted a piece of metal in the ravine . Tom ? I saw what looked like the bumper of a car . But when i got closer , i could see that it was one of those old-timey ones , You know , like--like you see in the movies . And then i saw the bones . Personal effects found in the vehicle reveal the remains to be those of fred jeffers , A man who disappeared in the 1920s . Wait ! What are you doing ? What are you- - what do you want ? No ! Please stop ! No ! " jeffers ' disappearance " was a terrible blow for chandler , " who endured a string of tragedies " starting with the death of his beloved son will , Who died on new year 's eve , 1920 . " New year 's eve , 1920 . Let 's get ' em out of here . That 's rupert chandler 's boy . Let 's cover him up . Let 's get him out of here . Come on . Will chandler died in the speakeasy fire . And myron stark was there . So there must be a connection . I thought you were gonna kill that guy . Why 'd you call me ? Because . I wanted you to come . Weird way of showing it . Oh , the flirting with mike thing ? I 'm a teenage girl , john . We do that kind of crap to guys we like . The loner weirdo ? I don 't get it . Never gotten it . My old foster parents are these ' 60s hippies . Always talking like they were single-handedly saving the world because they recycled . They called me the deviant . Like , " the deviant got a " c " in math . " " should we take the deviant to see bruce hornsby ? " That 's why i came up to you that day , john . Because i thought since you 're a weirdo , you might get me . My foster parents used to call me the delinquent . So you did take the lighter . I like shiny things . Bad habit . What happened to your real parents ? They died when i was little . In a fire . Why were you in a foster home ? You have your mom . She was in a mental hospital . That explains things . She was engaged once . He was a pretty cool guy . Didn 't work out , but he was kind of the only friend we had . Little while ago , he , uh , helped us with something . There was an accident and his new wife died . And he left . That 's what happens . I shouldn 't be around people . Is that why you went nuclear on mike ? No , that 's ... That 's other stuff . Do you want to talk about it ? Sometimes , yes . Mostly no . But sometimes yes . i found will chandler 's obituary . I 'm kind of peeing right now . Can 't it wait ? 400 people came to his funeral . He had a lot of friends . His father had a lot of money . There 's a difference . I think stark killed him . We don 't even know if they knew each other . And if stark wanted to kill chandler , why take out 43 innocent people ? It happens . Do you ever think about dying ? About what ? Or about suicide ? Why would i think about that ? Because there 's something wrong with you . Gee , don 't ever look for work as a counselor . I 've never thought about killing myself . Not for a minute . It would destroy my mom , for one . I couldn 't do that to my family , to the people who love me . Could you ? Anyways , i 'm not sick anymore . I mean , i have to get a scan every six months . But so far i 'm clean . Earlier when i cross-referenced the names of survivors from the fire , This woman 's name came up in a documentary about the roaring ' 20s . It might tell us more about what happened inside the speakeasy . Film vault 's on the top floor . You 'll have to go alone . Why ? No wheelchair access . You 're really strong . I work out . Look at all this . Dvds are all right , but this is the real deal . Silver nitrate . Raw . Before film makers figured out all the tricks . Pure humanity on film . None of that computer generated , digital crap they do today . All these people captured , frozen in time . They never age . I mean , 100 years could pass . They 'll still be here . Still look exactly the same . It would be nice , wouldn 't it ? Freeze yourself in a moment . The best moment of your life . Have things never change . Be beautiful . Healthy . Strong . Anyway ... Don 't let me get all a. e. housman on you . Uh , the documentaries are up there . We would go out to the gin joints every weekend . We 'd drink , and smoke , and dance the black bottom , the charleston , the shimmy . Oh , i was a real bearcat back then . And i was crazy in love with this prizefighter . We were together there , the night when the fire started . He was helping everybody out . And i just rember ... Sitting on the curb ... Crying . People said that , uh , someone threw a bomb in the door . Now , to tell you the truth , i was pretty zozzled . That 's what we called it then . But i didn 't see a bomb . Uh , what i did see was this , um , this flash of blue light and sparks , Then the craziest thing . This man in the middle of the room , naked as a jaybird . I don 't know . Maybe i just imagined the whole thing . Who knows ? Probably the liquor talking . The fire , it was an accident . Yeah , sounds like there was some electrical problem . He didn 't mean to kill all those people . No . Of course not . It 's just like inthe wizard of oz when the house falls on the witch . Give me your clothes . Hey , where are you going ? I know what he was looking at . He was measuring the stars ' radial velocity , the distance in parsecs , And the cartesian coordinates . What ? Why ? To pinpoint the date . You can tell the date by looking at the sky ? Stellar motion can be used to calculate what the sky will look like for hundreds of years in the future or the past . Why is the date so important ? It 's not . Unless it 's the wrong date . Myron stark was in the wrong place at the wrong time . " if we cry because the sun has gone out of our lives , " our tears can prevent us from seeing the stars . " Chandler 's eulogy for his son ? " today is a day for mourning . " but it is also a day to rember my son . " a gifted young man with a grand heart . " a budding architect , " his dream was to build pico tower " on the corner of 3rd and pico . " that was his land , " the soil where his dreams were to take root . " it will remain his land forever , " never to be sold or developed . " instead , his legacy will live on " in a memorial garden i will plant there in his honor . " That can 't be right . There is a pico tower in downtown la . It 's an architectural landmark . We took a field trip there in third grade . Someone must 've built it . Tax records . They show chandler 's rivalry with stark cost him everything . His business went under in july 1925 . His assets were auctioned off to pay off his debt , including the property at 3rd and pico . Bankruptcy . Tragic accidents . The death of a beloved son . It 's like the family 's cursed . Mr. Chandler , i 'm myron stark . Do i know you ? No , you don 't know me . Mr. Chandler 's in a hurry . I 'm interested in purchasing a piece of property . 3rd and pico . That land 's not for sale . I 'll pay twice what it 's worth . Are you deaf ? He said it 's not for sale . Does it say who bought it ? The pico property ? M. s. stark ? So he not only bought the land , but he designed it himself ? The building . It 's about the building . What is ? Stark accidentally killed the man who was going to build it , So he had to build it himself . Everything he did was to drive chandler under and get him to sell that land . Okay . There must be a reason why stark need to build it . You wanna know the really weird thing ? Stark disappeared two weeks before the building opened in may of 1927 . Disappeared ? Fell off the face of the earth . Never seen again . What 's happened at pico tower since it was built ? Anything important ? Anything on new year 's eve ? New year 's eve when ? Any new year 's eve . Not that i can see . In fact , it 's closed now . They had to retrofit after the last earthquake . I 'm not sure when they 're reopening . I thought you left . What are you doing back here ? Are you all right ? What happened ? I 'm fine . Your brother again ? I 'm fine . You never touched your donuts . I wasn 't hungry . Your muscles are weak . It was difficult for you to pull the trigger of the glock . And you 've lost 8 % of your body weight in the past two weeks . When i carried you to the film fault , i weighed you . Wait , what ? This whole night , the entire time , you 've been examing me ? What--what the hell is going on here ? Your cancer is back . You have a secondary tumor in the long bone of your arm and possibly your lungs . Are you joking ? No . Then you 're crazy , you don 't know what you 're talking about . Ewing 's sarcoma . First identified in the 1920s- - i know what it is , okay ? I 'm the one in here ! No wonder you don 't have any friends . You can 't just do things like that . You can 't just show up whenever you need somethin ' . You can 't carry a gun around and freak people out , And walk into the bathroom wh a guy 's taking a leak and ask him if he 's gonna kill himself . And you can 't just blurt things out like " you have cancer , " Especially to someone who 's already had it . You have no clue , do you ? You have no idea what it 's like to have something inside of you , something that 's damaged . It 's like a bomb ... Waiting to go off . I need to finish my paper . You should make an appointment with your oncologist . The tumor 's still small . Get out . Where were you all night ? Out . Carbon chain c24 . Lanolin and red dye # 27 . You were with riley . We 're closed . Is eric here ? Eric ? He works the night shift . He lets me in . I have no idea . They just called and asked me to come in . Sorry . Do you like donuts ? I have one glazed , one rainbow sprinkle , one cinnamon twist . . : Napisy24 - Nowy Wymiar Napisów : . Napisy24.pl

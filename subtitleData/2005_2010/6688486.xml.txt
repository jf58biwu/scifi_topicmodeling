 NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes . My dad lied to me about my entire life , my biological parents , my ability . You can 't just hide things like that . ZACH : A 21-year-old woman was killed in the explosion . also killed in the fire was her 18-month-old daughter . Hi , I 'm looking for someone related to Meredith Gordon . This is her . Mom ? Where are you taking us ? Tell your boss I am on very important mission . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) It could take years to integrate a multiple personality , but if you let me , I can help you . What I am , you can 't fix . Who are you ? How can you see me ? I don 't know . I just do what you can do . I 'm the Invisible Man . I 'm CIaude Rains . Now get away from me . I found you . I need you to help me . This entire city is in danger . You seemed pretty sure about that pending apocalypse of yours . How many people have you taught before me ? If he crashes , you bring him back , again and again . He 's dead . Well , that 's less than ideal . WOMAN : Ow ! Hey ! I don 't see how petty theft is part of my training . There 's a Iot you don 't see . You have no idea how to use these gifts of yours properly . Yeah , and you do ? No . Right now , your abilities only show up as a reflex . Autonomic , Iike swallowing . That 's a dog 's trick . Making it a conscious choice , using it , that 's what makes you more than a poodle . Now , is insulting me really going to help me learn how to do that ? Listen , you 're the one who 's a bomb set to blow up me and everyone in this city , unless I can get you housebroken . CLAUDE : That 's right , now he 's listening . Now , you absorb all these abilities you find , yeah ? You 're invisible with me , you 've flown , you 've read some minds . Yeah , it put me in a coma for two weeks . Your body doesn 't know what to do with them all . It 's gotten jumbled , Iike file cards knocking around a shoebox , except with you , the cards are doused in plutonium , piling up to a critical mass . Now , I 'm gonna teach you how to pull them out one at a time . PETER : You think that 's possible ? I hope so . Next time you shut down might not be just a coma . It might be the day you meltdown . So , then let 's get to today 's lesson . AII right . Let 's start by seeing if you can hold on to one of your powers without your benefactors hanging around . You think I could do that alone ? We 're about to find out . Remember to breathe . Hey ! God , it sounds like a bomb is about to go off . I know it 's hard . Just focus on the mirror and try to relax . I can 't relax . You 're trying to bring her out . Jessica . I told you , she is dangerous . She could hurt you . Show me . Those cuffs could keep an elephant in that chair . And just ' cause I 'm a shrink , don 't think I don 't know how to use that taser . I thought that the goal was to get rid of her . The goal here is to bring your two halves to a healthy middle , to have a unified and whole you , not two aspects at war . How do we do this ? Like I said , you focus on the reflection , and breathe . Come on . Feel free to let your mind wander . We used to have a piano in our home . You played ? Chopsticks , barely . My sister . Jessica . She played beautifully . I used to play with her sheet music . I didn 't know what it was , just dots and lines . I would get out my crayons and connect the dots . Jessica used to say I could turn Mozart into a monkey . JESSICA : I sure did . Jessica . You should 've listened to little mouse . ( EXCLAIMS ) ( DOOR OPENING ) How 's claire ? That was for the haircut . You shouldn 't have built such a good cage . If you go anywhere near her ... No ! No ! No ! ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) You didn 't just use your key this time . I shouldn 't have them , not anymore . You started painting since you got back from rehab . Can I see them ? That 's not done yet . Oh , God . That 's the roof of my father 's building . We had a Iot of good memories up there . Is that how you painted our relationship , like a city destroyed ? What are you looking for , Simone ? It 's Peter . He 's still missing . I 'm running out of places to look . You finally believe I can paint the future , and you want to use it to find your new boyfriend . I don 't want to be asking you this , either . Can you ? I have been . Except it 's not working . Every time I try to paint where Peter is , I get nothing . You 've been trying to find him ? Why ? I know what he can do . He 's the one that 's gonna turn New York into this . I 'm not gonna let him . How do you know so much about him ? Because I painted it . I care about you , Simone , more than I knew how to say when ... When it would have made a difference . But right now , I don 't care if you hate me , I just want you safe . Stay away from Peter . Just tell me you 'II look for him . I 'II try . Yeah . Simone . Keep the key . ( GROWLING ) The manatee 's on the brink of extinction . There 's one at the aquarium in Lubbock and the marine biologist said we could stop by anytime . You 're asking my permission to skip school ? No , if I wanted to skip school , I 'd check into homeroom , and then sneak out Miss Robert 's window , but you 've always stressed honesty , so I 'm being honest . The manatee is a very noble creature . Is your car in working order , Zachary ? I just had the oil changed . Any tickets ? Just parking . You 'II be home for dinner . Yes . That 's not a question . I 'm making fajitas . Zach , you 're welcome to join us . ( SANDRA LAUGHING ) Let 's go . Okay . We 'II wait 15 minutes , and then head out . Do you have the directions to Kermit ? Uh , yeah . Look , what if your mom wants proof about the aquarium ? Where did you get these ? Motel 6 lobby and my color printer . No one can know we 're going to see my real mom . We have to be perfect . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( ALARM RINGING ) ( DOOR BUZZING ) Get a doctor ! Oh ! Wait . What happened ? No ! I tried to tell her . Take me back to my cell ! Love to . Thanks for almost getting me arrested . A little more focus , you 'd have had some cash and fresh lipstick . I never said it 'd be easy . In fact , I think I said repeatedly it 'd be crap . You 've been doing this for 15 years . Cut me a Iittle slack on trying to do it for five minutes . You 'II learn . We 've just got to find what 's holding you back . Cops have my name and address . I 'm pretty sure Nathan 's gonna kill me first , anyway . You worry a Iot about your people , don 't you ? Your friends , your mother , your brother . No wonder your head 's all clogged . You 're still sunk under . Under what ? Your attachments . AII these people who feed you biscuits , pat your head , and tell you you 're not fit for the outdoors . You still see yourself through their eyes . Is that it ? No . I don 't . Right . Well , I 'II bet you $ 20 your dad didn 't make much of you , either . God , you 're easy ! We 've got to get these people out of your head . Do you understand ? These people are my family . I can 't just cut them out . Peter can 't use his powers without someone holding his hand . How can you not punch that face every time you see it ? He 's not Iike that . He is . Trust me . You don 't know him . I don 't need to . I 've spent a Iot of time moving around people 's homes , their bedrooms . You get to know people if you see them when they think they 're alone . You see them for what they truly are . Selfish , deceitful and gassy . So , what is that , your big truth about the world ? The sooner you learn it , the sooner we get that collar off your neck . People suck , friend , every last one of them . Never forget that . Not all of them . Oh , right , there 's a girl . She 's not Iike the rest of them . Everyone 's like the rest , that 's why they 're the rest . Fine . Let 's go and see what your girl 's up to . Then maybe we can clear your head . Wait . Wait . You want to spy on her ? Look , you could follow her all you want . I 'm telling you , she 's not Iike that . Well , then no harm in taking a look . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) Hmm . This is it , number 36 . Nice pinwheel collection . You know , I always imagined my parents would live in a penthouse in New York City . Not some trailer park in Kermit . So she lives in a trailer ? Maybe she likes the open road . Just not what I imagined . Stop imagining . She 's right there . What am I supposed to say ? " Hi , I 'm your daughter , and I can re-grow my kidney " ? I mean , what if she 's got burns and scars from the fire . She 's supposed to be dead , right ? So are you , remember ? I heard you got that in common . Hey , where are you going ? I 'm getting rid of your exit strategy . You 'II be fine . I 'II be back in time for fajitas . claire ? Yeah . ( GROWLING ) Hi , little fluffy . claire home from school yet ? No ? We 'II just wait . Now , what 's your name ? ( DOOR OPENING ) SANDRA : Mr. Muggles , where are you , baby ? Mama 's home ! Of course . Let 's go say hi . Oh ! I 'm sorry . Who are you ? I just came from the paper factory , ma 'am . I 'm just making a delivery for your husband , and I saw this little guy in the street . ( LAUGHS ) Now , somebody must have left the backdoor open . Oh , I hope you don 't mind , I took the liberty . Well , aren 't you sweet ? And he was just out there in the yard ? Oh . Just chewing on a sprinkler head . Hmm . Who left those doors open , Mr. Muggles ? claire or Lyle ? You tell me , so I can tan their ass . Well , thanks for inviting me in . I always wanted to see where Mr. Bennet lived . It is so funny how all y 'all call him Mr. Bennet over there . I 've always just known him as ... Stop that , you . SANDRA : No more shoes . He just discovered shoelaces . Can 't get enough . That 's funny , I never really imagined him as much of a dog person . I guess he just Iooms a Iittle larger when he 's drilling you . He mostly talks about claire . I was hoping to meet her , actually . I 've heard so much about her . Well , she has promised to be home for dinner , which means a half an hour late . My son is at a tae kwon do sleepover tonight . That means an extra plate . Why don 't you stay for dinner ? Least I can offer my new hero . Are you sure ? It 's not too much trouble ? I will call my husband and tell him to expect you . What did you say your name was again , Mr ... Sylar . Oh , I don 't think you 'II reach him at the office , though . Last I saw he was just swamped . I 'm staring . I 'm sorry . ( SIGHS ) I mean , you have to understand . I never thought this would happen . You 're sitting inches away from me . You 're so beautiful . Thank you . Are you a good student ? I 'm okay . Lousy at math . No help from me there . Well , I 'II bet you 're all kinds of popular . I was homecoming queen , kind of . Damn , I missed so much . If I 'd known you were out there , but ... You must think something awful . I was so sure that nothing could have survived that fire . It was a miracle that I did , and ... God , when I saw that roof ... Don 't question the miracle , right ? Here , it 's horchata . I Iearned a secret recipe in Mexico . It 's sweet . You lived in Mexico ? Mmm-hmm . Oh , I moved around a Iot . After I lost you , I sort of started running . I never really stopped . I only came back to Kermit a couple of months ago . I spent some time in Cuernavaca , in La Paz . You 've never been . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Sorry . It 's my mom . Hi . Yeah , we 're at the aquarium right now . They just let Zach feed him turtle grass . We 're practically on our way . We 'II be home in , Iike , an hour . No , I won 't let him speed . Okay , bye . She doesn 't know you 're here . She doesn 't really understand what 's going on with me right now . Neither of my parents do . I 'II pretend I understand why you 're sneaking around . AII girls deserve their secrets , right ? Seems like I have a Iot of them these days . I have to show you something . You may understand it , you may not , but ... I need you to see . See what ? I think I know how I survived that fire . claire , don 't ! It 's okay . please , say something . Some family . I told claire to get a move on . She said she 'd be back soon . A cheerleader , huh ? Co-captain by junior year . Wow ! although not so much these days . They dissolved the team because of some horrible event at the school . Oh , I heard about that . That must have been hard on poor claire . You are awfully interested in my daughter . Well , ever since I 've seen what she can do , I guess you could say I 'm a fan . She 's really quite gifted . Oh , you 've been to a game ? Yeah , I guess I have . I just couldn 't get over those irresistible talents of hers . I should ... I should check with my husband again . Excuse me . I 'd rather you didn 't , so I can surprise him . How ... How did you do that ? I 'm special , just like claire . Well , different , but you catch the meaning . It 's a shame I 'II have to kill her . But maybe I 'II kill you first . I really haven 't decided yet . ( GROANING ) ( GASPING ) Hi . Find him . He dies ! I don 't understand what happened . Why was he ... He moved the phone without even touching it . Shh . You 're safe now . I 'm right here . I 'II find him . He kept asking about claire . claire 's fine . She 's safe , too , and she 'II stay that way . I promise . Who is that ? This is my friend . He 's gonna make everything okay . He 'II help you forget again . Again ? What do you mean , " again " ? It 's okay . Hold my hand . It 'II all be over soon . MEREDITH : You could stay a Iittle longer , have some dinner . I can 't cook worth crap but ... Well , I was supposed to be home a while ago . I got about six messages from my dad telling me to come home right away , so ... He sounded pretty pissed . Hey . This isn 't goodbye , you know that ? I was hoping you could tell me about my father . Well , that 's complicated . Why don 't you let me work on that for next time ? ( HORN HONKING ) Some family . Here . Little something from Mexico . Oh , no , I can 't . You can , and you 're gonna . It 'II look 10 times better on you than it ever did on me . Isaac ? ( SIGHS ) We haven 't been up here together in a Iong time . There 's something about this roof . ( CHUCKLES ) You and I spent a Iot of time up here . I mean , it 's connected with what 's happening . It 's important somehow . Well , it 's certainly mysterious . You know , I never figured out how those pigeons got up here . My father always said , " If they found their way , we ought to let them be . " I know we had a Iot together , Isaac , for a Iong time . You saw it , the painting of us . It 's the future I still hope for . This city took me in . Everything important that ever happened to me , happened here . Good , bad , you . And now it 's all going to be destroyed because I can 't stop it . You don 't know that . It keeps coming back , worse every time . You saw what this looks like after the bomb . The world will never recover from that . That 's not true . You can 't lose hope . ( SIGHS ) What hope is there ? There 's you , what you can do . Why else would you be allowed to see the future unless it was to do something about it ? You can 't just see the future , Isaac . You make it . You 'II find a way . You really believe that ? I believe in you . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( GROANS ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) GUARD : Get dressed . Dressed for what ? You 're going home . That 's not possible . Oh , it 's more than possible . The charges against you have been dropped , Miss Sanders . What ? The D.A. threw out the entire case . That can 't happen . I killed people . Well , the state of Nevada isn 't so sure about that anymore . It seems a rather terrible gentleman on death row confessed to all the crimes you 're accused of . DNA evidence backed up everything . Wonderful system , isn 't it ? As far as they 're concerned , justice has been served . And as far as Linderman is concerned ? Oh , don 't worry about tomorrow 's problems today . No , I need to be in here . I need help . You only need to get dressed , Miss Sanders . You 're going home . No . That 's the one you love , off to dinner with the guy she left to be with you . Sort of fickle , don 't you think ? Why would you show me that ? I didn 't show you anything . She did . We just followed her , not even very long . I 'm sorry , Peter . No , you 're not . You enjoyed that . You 've got this rosy film over your eyes , Iike a kid . It 's no wonder you live like an adolescent . Posters on the wall , hair in your face . You 've got to see the world as it is , it 's the only way you 'II learn how to save it . And , what , be like you , a hermit ? No one knows you 're alive except for some pigeons . You have to get rid of your distractions . The people I Iove are not distractions . Then why can 't you fly ? You 've done it . You 're body remembers how . The only thing standing in your way is you . What am I supposed to do , cut them out of my Iife ? How cold do you expect me to be ? Did you forget you 're a bomb ? You 've got to remember what this is about , or do you have to ask for your brother 's permission for that as well ? Anything else that I have to do ? You want to make a list ? You 're a sad cartoon of a broken heart , bleeding all over the place . I 'm just trying to get your mind straight . Look , I have followed you around and listened to your half-assed wisdom . You don 't have any answers , okay ? You don 't know anything . You are afraid of the world . You have to listen to me . And I am tired of you telling me what I have to do ! I don 't have to do anything ! Except fly . ( EXCLAIMS ) Son of a bitch . Not quite what I was expecting , but hope for the flowers , yet . You threw me off of a 30-story building . If I didn 't regenerate , I 'd be dead . Well , you could have flown . Listen , if you hadn 't have worked this one out , you 'd be hopeless anyway , and I 'd have diffused the biggest bomb ever . But you did it , didn 't you ? You cleared your mind . You called out your power . Right before I hit the ground , when I knew what was about to happen , I had this flash in my head of this girl that I met in Texas , this cheerleader . She had healed herself . My God , she 's this sweet kid , sad little smile , and she just ... You were wrong . I don 't have to cut her out . I have to remember her . How she made me feel . That 's how I ... Oh . Oh , God . It 's happening . I 'm losing it . ( SIGHS ) Well , it 's a start . Peter ? ( PHONE RINGING ) Yes . ISAAC : I think I found a way to stop him . I found him . Sylar ? I thought you had Sylar . I will again , soon . Do you mean Petrelli ? Where is he ? I think he 's been here this whole time , and I 've been painting him . Except no one can see him , Iike he 's a ghost , or ... invisible . What does that mean ? It means an old friend isn 't quite as dead as we thought he was . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) Huh ? Mom , I know it 's not our game night , but can we play a game of Scrabble ? Since you just got home ? Absolutely . I owe you , Iike , a dozen . Just give me a minute , okay ? Okay . ( BANGING ) No ! What are you so mad about , Niki ? You 're the one who wanted to be locked up . I 'm home ! SANDRA : In the kitchen . You are in big trouble , young lady . The school called . Did you think you could ditch , and I wouldn 't find out ? Mom , we talked about it this morning . Zach and I went to the aquarium . claire , I think I would remember a conversation about you skipping school . ( MOANS ) Are you okay ? Fine , just banged my head on something . Bit of a headache . Why don 't you let me finish setting the table , and you can go lie down for a Iittle bit ? Don 't think this gets you off the hook . ( PHONE RINGING ) NATHAN : Hello ? You might not remember me . We haven 't spoken in a Iong time , but ... our daughter just found me . Did you hear what I just said ? She 's alive . We need to talk , Nathan . ime . You saw what this looks like after the bomb . The world will never recover from that . That 's not true . You can 't lose hope . ( SIGHS ) What hope is there ? There 's you , what you can do . Why else would you be allowed to see the future unless it was to do something about it ? You can 't just see the future , Isaac . You make it . You 'II find a way . You really believe that ? I believe in you . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( GROANS ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) GUARD : Get dressed . Dressed for what ? You 're going home . That 's not possible . Oh , i

 [ Wedeck ] On October 6th , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . [ Mark ] In my flash forward , I was investigating what caused all this . I seemed to have an idea why all of this was happening . We know you were planning an attack . Tell me what happened ! We didn 't do this . You were still planning on killing thousands of people . I think God did this . To punish us . I 'm a little at sea in dealing with Dylan 's condition . He 's autistic . This man means nothing to me . I 'm not gonna cheat on you . On March 15th , 2010 , you are going to be murdered . [ # Bj√∂rk : It 's Oh So Quiet ] [ Glass shattering ] - [ Explosion ] - [ Crashing ] [ Exploding ] [ Music stops ] [ Gasping , coughing ] [ Shouting in foreign language ] Help me ! It 's OK . You 're gonna be fine . You 're gonna be just fine , OK ? What we 're gonna do is on one , two , three , you 're gonna take a big breath with me , OK ? One , two , three . [ Both inhaling ] [ Man ] I wish I could have saved more people . I reached the surface , did the Australian crawl to the shore and then I walked home . Oh , and then I , you know , realized that the whole world had blacked out . That was two weeks ago . This is the first time you 've seen a doctor ? Yeah , I didn 't need one till now . - OK . Well , Mr. Ned ... - You can call me Edward . - Edward , do you ... - Wait , you know , call me Ned . My friends call me Ned . - Ned Ned ? - Yes , yes . - Hey , how did you stay so calm ? - I don 't know . I just was . It says here that triage gave you morphine for your pain . - Does that mean ... - They should call that " mor-fine " . That 's how I 'm feeling for the first time since the crash . - Why didn 't you come in sooner ? - It didn 't start off so bad . I thought I maybe just bruised my spleen or something . OK , Mr. Ned ... um , Ned . Whatever . With your low blood count and your pain , we should keep you for observation and a CT scan . It 's all gravy , Dr. Benford . Truly . OK , good . After the blackout , do you remember what you ... Your flash forward , what did you see ? Not where I was going . You really want to know ? I was rocking leather pants . I 've never rocked leather pants . [ # George Clinton : Atomic Dog ] It 's always been one of my top three fears , along with clowns and escalators . But there I was , rocking out at this bar that I 've always wanted to go to , but I 've never gone to because I thought I 'd be too nervous , that I 'd be , well , too nervous . But it wasn 't that way . I was happy . I was at peace . Oh , and I was black . Wait . You were ... black ? In six months ? Yeah . Like Oprah . You know , African-American . Black . OK ! OK , Mr. Ned . Well , OK . - I 'll see you later , Mr. Ned . Yeah . - OK . So , they 're your parents , you should be the one to tell them - that we moved up the wedding . - Mm-hmm . A free trip to Hawaii still won 't make up for the fact that I 'm not Korean . Right . OK , where have you been for the last 20 minutes ? I 'm fine . It 's just work stuff . Work stuff . I 've been trying to trace a call from , uh ... an informant . - Is everything OK ? - Yeah . I 'm here . OK . Well , speaking of work , can I ask you something work-related ? Are you Gitmoing a suspect downtown ? - No . - Some blonde ? Arrested the day of the blackout ? - Bin Laden in Prada ? - I can 't confirm or deny this , Zo . - I think you just did , sweetie . - [ Chuckling ] Wow . Professionally , if the Bureau 's violating due process , that 's uncool . But , personally , if that woman has anything to do with the blackout , I hope you 're getting all Dick Cheney on her ass to find out what she knows . [ Mark ] Ladies and gentlemen ... - [ clearing throat ] - [ Charlie giggling ] As Egg-bert , I would like to egg-spress my desire for you to eat oatmeal this morning . [ Giggling ] You 're silly , Daddy . - Silly ? Can I get a " cluck , cluck " ? - Cluck , cluck ! Cluck , cluck . Thank you muchly . I believe you know my mum . [ Clearing throat ] - [ Cracks ] - Oh ! Aw , Egg-bert . Wow , you really are the Shakespeare of cheesy dad humor . You could play , too . You could be ... [ French accent ] ... the French toast , - the toast of love . - [ Laughing ] - Good morning . - Morning . - Hey , Mommy . - [ Olivia ] Hi , sweetie . So , guess who 's picking you up from school this morning . - Nicole ? - [ Olivia ] That 's right , Nicole . She missed you . She 's ready to start baby-sitting again . Yay ! - Yeah ! Nicole 's coming . - Yeah , Nicole 's coming back . [ Nicole ] Thanks for breakfast . First time in a while I 've been out acting like a normal person . I know what you mean . You want an ice cream or something ? Where was that place Tracy used to take you when you were little ? They turned it into a Giant Juice when I was a freshman . She spent all the money she made baby-sitting you buying you milkshakes . I should get going . It 's my first day back at the Benfords ' . I don 't wanna be late . Mark told me you went AWOL . I 'm sorry , Aaron . You got me that job with them and I 've totally screwed it up . If that were true , they wouldn 't have asked you to come back . You know , Nicole , you 're not alone . Everyone 's freaked out by this . But I think we have to surrender to a higher power , and have faith that whatever we saw , we saw for a reason . So make cowbell lady NPO , we 'll take her to the OR if she spikes again . - Yeah . - And ... what happened to the scan we ... Oh , come on . Come on ! [ Groaning ] What did the scan show on our bus crash guy ? - Yeah , Ned ? - Mm-hm . Well , I can 't stop thinking about that guy . I mean , how does somebody possibly go from being Caucasian to African-American ? I mean , if that 's the vision that he saw in his future ... Bryce , I need you in the present . Here , now . You know , patient care , doctoring , CT scan ? Still don 't have it . ER 's got traumas . They keep bumping Ned from the scanner . So , I ran into Dr. Flemming earlier . - Who ? - Blythe Flemming , the psychiatrist you 're supposed to be following up with every week . Yeah , well , it 's just I 've had my rounds and ... Come on . Less than a month ago , you were standing on a pier with a gun . [ Gun cocking ] Look , I know how it sounds . Things have changed ... If you want to keep working here , you need to follow up with Psych , got it ? - [ Dylan yelling ] - Excuse me . Oh ! Bollocks . Hey , honey . Sorry . [ Grunts ] You know what ? That Simcoe kid is off O2 now . I wanna - transfer him to physical therapy . - Yeah , but he 's on IV antibiotics . [ Dylan groans ] - Just as soon as you can , OK ? - Yeah . I need that scan of Ned 's , wheel him to the scanner yourself if you have to . OK . [ Wedeck ] You wanna go to Somalia now ? Last week , you talked me into flying you to Germany because of an index card . - And it paid off . - Mm-hm . You found out some crows died in Somalia 18 years ago . Your definition of " paid off " is a little different than mine . If a blackout had happened before , that 'd be major . I agree . Which kind of makes you wonder why we haven 't heard about it before . Evidence , Stan . There 's evidence . Last I checked , all you 've got is a footnote in a CDC funding request . I have been working on trying to get satellite photos of the region from ' 91 out of Langley . They 've been giving us the runaround ... Or , maybe , the CIA 's just a little busy these days to dig through satellite intel from last decade . Guys , I get it . Germany didn 't exactly work out , and you 're trying to stretch a single into a triple . I get it . But going to war with the CIA is not the way to do it . Hey , Al . Remember that hacker we busted ? You know , the one who broke into the DOD 's network , trying to take our overseas drones for a joyride ? - Mr. Cheeto-dust . - Yeah , that 's him . Don 't you think he 'd find Langley 's mainframe a delightful challenge ? Yeah , he 'd find it delightful . It 's illegal . Whoa , spying on your own country ? That 's more than procedural jujitsu . You 're talking about a federal offense . Yeah . You 're right . Where 's Demetri ? He brought that hot blonde terrorist over from holding . He 's questioning her . - Why ? - I don 't know . Because she 's hot ? [ Woman scoffs ] I 'll repeat what I 've said many times : My name is Alda Hertzog and I 'm an honest businessperson . We caught you doing business on the day of the blackout , remember ? With known terrorists , selling weaponized nuclear material . Then charge me with a crime . - You can 't hold me here indefinitely . - You 're right . You should call your embassy and complain . Which embassy is that , by the way ? We wanna know ' cause , um we wanna get you the right phone card . I 'm truly flattered that you still feel the need to talk to me after all that 's happened . But I have done nothing wrong . It 's my associates who you want . Honey , your associates died on the day of the blackout . They were super-dead . So you wanna give me somebody else ? Customer Choice Restaurant Group . It 's in Indio . Town comes up a bunch of times from wiretaps , but we never found out the significance . Customer Choice Restaurant Group . That 's all I have for you today . You are running out of time for this to continue being a civil conversation . Really , Agent Noh ? Here I thought you were the one running out of time . What 'd you say ? You really should get out there before it 's too late . I 'm not getting this . Instead of following up on the Somalia lead , you want to reopen the dirty bomb case ? We never closed it . And Somalia is not a lead , it 's an urban myth . At best . Meanwhile , back on planet Earth , we have a material witness . - In a weapons deal . - That broke on the day of the blackout ! OK ? So maybe it 's not as sexy as dead poultry in Africa , but you gotta admit the timing 's a little hinky here , Mark . - It 's a coincidence ! - So what if it is ? It is a legit lead on a terrorism investigation , which is kind of what we do around here . Agreed . Send me a postcard from Indio . OK . What the hell 's the matter with you ? I just want to be an FBI agent today , all right ? Life is short . Thank you ... for putting up with me . Hi , Mr. Simcoe . I 'm afraid I 'm the annoying parent who always wants a thousand details . I 'd like to apologize for that . I can tell it makes you uncomfortable . No , it doesn 't . Doesn 't make me uncomfortable at all . I 'm sorry about the outburst this morning . The tantrum in the hallway , the ... unidentified flying meal tray . It 's his autism . I really don 't know what to say to him when he 's like that . Oh , sometimes you can 't say anything . You just have to be there . Thanks . Thank you . Unfortunately , I haven 't really been there since our separation . You know , work picked up and , um ... Well , I barely know him . Well , you 're here now . That 's what counts . A good night 's sleep might help . Yeah , well , despite the luxury of two rigid plastic chairs in Dylan 's room , the Sandman has proven a bit elusive . You shouldn 't be sleeping in his room every night . Well , actually , the police brought me the keys to his mother 's house . I can 't bring myself to go there for some reason . Well , you should try . Maybe being in Dylan 's room around his things , might give you some sense of who he is . Too much time in the hospital is not good for anyone , Mr. Simcoe . You hang in there . Hey , Dr. B. I got that scan that you wanted . I was gonna grab a veggie dog while it prints out . Transfer Dylan Simcoe to physical therapy . - But I thought you wanted ... - PT can handle the antibiotics . - Just transfer him . - OK . I don 't understand what all this is about . Welcome to my world . This restaurant came up in a confidential investigation . We need the names and addresses of every employee . The list , please . Thank you . Burgers and waffle fries , that 's all we do . Well , for now , at least . We 're gonna be adding frozen yogurt in , you know , the future . This place is owned by Customer Choice Restaurant Group ? This place is Customer Choice Restaurant Group . We 're not quite a group yet . Would you give me and Agent Noh a moment , please ? Sure , yeah . Somebody get some burgers for these FBI guys , please ! Wow . I can 't believe I didn 't want to come here . I mean the intel . - They 're adding frozen yogurt . - Mark ... [ glass breaks ] Freeze ! FBI ! - [ Tires screeching ] - [ Horn honking ] Freeze ! [ Trumpet playing ] [ Baby crying ] - Go left . I 'll take right . - Gotcha . [ Man shouting ] Give me your arms . Give me your arms ! - You got him ! - Yeah . - Shut up , man ! - Why are you running , man ? Get up . Get up ! - We were just coming in for a burger . - On your knees ! Get down on your knees ! I heard what you 're being . FBI can be biting my ass ! Oh , hello ! Yellowcake uranium , Mark . Black-market nuclear material . Or should we leave it , go to your office and stare at your board ? You don 't be wanting this , yo . - Hey ! - Yellow cake . It 's the type of strain , the type of weed he 's slinging ! It 's the sickest strain around , yo . In my flash forward , I 'm driving pimping ride . Nineteen-inch rims , yo . I must be going to be Scarface of pot . You can 't be fighting fate , yo . Shut up ! [ Man ] Truth hurts , pig ! - Get off of me ! - What are you doing ? - He 's flipping his mouth ! - I 'm talking about today , you ! Racing around , looking for someone to shoot ! Drop your personal crap and do your job ! Hey , I 'm doing something ! I 'm not sitting on my ass , - waiting for clues to appear in dreams . - Give it a rest . This isn 't about what I saw . It 's about what you didn 't ! March 15th . Three shots to the chest . I 'm not just gonna die . I 'm gonna be murdered . How 'd you find out ? Anonymous call . The woman said she read it in an intelligence briefing . That 's all she gave me . Mark , I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you , but I thought , maybe , I could find who 's gonna kill me or get a lead on them . I don 't know , man . Why would you think there was anything out here ? Alda said I was running out of time . - That was it ? - Yeah . Dem , Alda 's a pro . She knows you 're vulnerable and she pulled a number on you . All I can hear is the clock ticking . Every day . What am I supposed to do ? Somehow ... you get past the fear . - And you fight . - How ? You know what I saw . I 'm in my office , staring at the board , and men are coming in to kill me . You and I are partners . If they 're coming to kill me , - they 're probably after you , too . - It 's the future , Mark . - Why do you think you can stop it ? - ' Cause we saw it . We can use what we saw to stop what we saw . Demetri , we can solve your murder before it happens . That 's why I want to put everything we have on Mosaic . For you , for me , for everybody . Now , can we get out of here ? - Yeah . - OK . Oh , excuse me . Hey , Mr. Simcoe . Stepping out for a bit ? Just , uh ... following some advice . I think you left this in Dylan 's room . Oh , uh ... - Thanks . - She 's beautiful . - Yeah . - Your girlfriend ? Um ... We haven 't actually met . Coming up soon , a Glendale postal worker uses the Mosaic website to meet the officer he believes is going to save his life in the coming months . You won 't want to miss this . - But first , we 're keeping track ... - Incredible , isn 't it ? A temporal anomaly in global consciousness . Yeah , I think that qualifies . So what did you see ? I guess this is the new " how 's the weather , " isn 't it ? All right , then . Why not ? Um ... I was in a house , not my own house . I got a call from someone . I don 't know who it was , but it was urgent . Dylan was nearby , maybe in another room . - I heard a woman 's voice . - Hey , honey . I turned towards it . And it was over . I never saw her face . But I knew that we were together that she was important to me somehow . I know exactly what you mean . Thank you . Um , excuse me one second . Sorry . Dr. Benford ! Dr. B. Dr. B ! Ned 's CT . Oh , great . Whoa . Big hematoma . Blood 's been gathering around the liver since the bus crash . Ned 's lucky he showed up here in time . Well , no , it 's not luck . It 's ... He was alive in his vision , so clearly , - he made it to the hospital ... - Enough about visions . - No , Dr. Benford , it 's relevant data . - It 's not data . It 's not data any more than the dream I had last night . I don 't understand how you can ignore something that even the most skeptical people in the world think might be real . I 'm not ignoring the flash forwards . I 'm just not bringing them into the practice of medicine . Now , consent Mr. Ned for surgery and meet me in the OR . Well , with any surgery , there 's a risk of infection , blood loss , drug allergy and even death , Ned . It 's all gravy . You know , it 's OK if you 've got questions or if you 're worried . - This is a major surgery . - I get it . You 're telling me I need some sort of drug-allergy-death surgery . I 'm totally cool with it . I mean , I know it sounds weird , but some kind of change is happening . I mean , I don 't feel nervous or afraid of , like , anything . I mean , all that worrying all the time , it 's just , like , kept me from being the me I 'm supposed to be . Six months from now , I see myself , and I 'm like this invincible , fearless black guy , like Shaft or Bryant Gumbel . And knowing that ... It 's already changed me . [ Bell tolling ] [ Man ] Hello ? Oh ... Yes , yes . Rabbi Hirscholtz saw 15 in the last two weeks . Four , uh ... on Sunday , actually . I didn 't leave the cemetery until after sundown . Bye . Oh , I 'm sorry . So sorry about everything . It 's been so busy with everything . So how can I help you ? I , um ... [ cricket chirping ] Oh , I 'm ... [ chuckling ] I keep crickets . Oh , I really ... I really like the way they sound . So , Paige , you were saying ? Paige is my sister . I 'm Nicole . I only come on Christmas and sometimes on Easter . But that 's gonna change . I , um ... I want to help out . I want to start doing some volunteer work , in the morning before I have work and ... That 's great , but as far as volunteer work goes , we are full up . See , in a crisis like this , people , they really want to ... Well , people need to help . Uh ... Why don 't you tell me what this is all about ? How do I atone for something I haven 't done yet ? In my flash forward , I felt like I was being ... punished . Do you think ... Do you think God made this happen ? You know , it 's really hard to believe that there 's not a divine hand involved somehow . I 'll tell you what . This , right here , is Audrey Ridgway 's phone number . She is the volunteer coordinator . I hope she can help . Here 's a T-shirt . Bye . [ Door opens ] [ Door shuts ] - Where 's Ned ? - OR took him . - When ? - Ten , 15 minutes ago . What 's wrong ? Call the OR . We 're about to kill our patient . We can 't operate . I couldn 't figure it out . I couldn 't make sense of it , but now I 've got it . Ned has Addison 's disease ! Surgery could kill him . In the bus crash , he was calm in the face of an insane disaster . And again , today , he spoke about his flash forward . Oh , Bryce , please . And , again , he mentioned that he was weirdly calm and black . You better scrub if you want in on this case . If he 's got Addison 's , his body is making melanin compounds instead of adrenaline . That 's why his skin is going to get dark . - Yeah . I know what Addison 's is . - Without adrenaline , his body can 't mount the proper stress response . - That 's why he 's so serene . - Oh , Bryce , stop ! Without stress hormones , his body will be unable to adapt to surgery . - Blood pressure will tank , he 'll die . - Without surgery he 'll die . Listen ... You 're not listening to me . - In his vision , he saw ... - Enough about visions ! He needs hydrocortisone . I 'm not administering a harmful drug because a patient had a freaky dream . - They are not dreams . - Look , I don 't know what you saw . I don 't care . But it is affecting your professional judgment , - and it needs to stop . - How about your professional judgment ? - Excuse me ? - Come on , Dr. Benford . You know why you don 't want to believe in your flash forward . You said it yourself , you saw the end of your marriage . Oh , you are so out of line , Doctor ! You sticking your head in the sand is gonna end up killing our patient . You know what 's gonna kill our patient ? Arguing . Because he 's lying on that table , continuing to bleed . Now that 's not from a Magic Eight Ball or a Ouija board or some kind of vision . Right here , right now , that 's real . Don 't bother scrubbing in . [ # Lko : Look What You 've Done to Me ] [ Olivia ] Retract the duct a little more laterally . Yeah . - Suction . - [ Man ] Anyone make it to grand rounds ? This guy from Yale says he can enhance memory of the flash forwards using a calcineurin antagonist . - Yeah , I was there . Pretty cool . - Irrigation , please . [ Beeping ] [ Man ] BP 's 78 over 54 . - Stay clear of the hepatic artery . - Eight hundred CCs out . Guys , systolic 's in freefall . - Must be another bleeder somewhere . - Or some fluid shift . - Get a unit on the rapid infuser . - [ Man 2 ] Tributary 's ligated . - [ Woman ] One of six . - Hundred of lido , right away . He 's in V-tach ! - [ Man ] No pulse ! - [ Olivia ] Damn it . Code cart and a mig of epi . Let 's go , let 's go ! - [ Man ] Lido 's in . - [ Olivia ] Where 's the cart ? - You 're charged to 360 . - [ Man ] Get him . [ Olivia ] Clear . [ Beeping ] [ Man ] No change . Going again . Clear ! - [ Man 2 ] Come on . - [ Man ] Fourth epi 's in . - [ Olivia ] Chase it with lido . - [ Man ] He 's had five rounds . [ Olivia ] Amiodarone , then . This makes no sense . This makes no sense at all . A hundred migs of hydrocortisone , IV push . He 's got adrenal crisis , Addison 's disease . - What ? Nobody bothered to tell me ? - He hasn 't been diagnosed . Addison 's would explain the lack of response to fluids and pressors . - [ Olivia ] Exactly . Hold compressions . - Holding . [ Rhythmic beeping ] [ Man 2 ] Normal sinus . Good carotid . - [ Woman ] Nice catch , Dr. Benford . - Yeah . Let 's close him up . What do you know about Agent Noh 's murder ? His murder ? [ chuckles ] Something funny about that ? Just that I knew he didn 't have a flash forward . I had no idea he was gonna be murdered ... till now . How 'd you know he didn 't see anything ? Because your partner posted it on the Internet . Because everyone in this office knows . Any particular reason why you felt the need to waste the time of the agents investigating the blackout ? In all likelihood , nothing I tell you will be the truth . - So why persist in asking ? - Asking questions is my job . So let 's start with a simple one . What do you know about the blackout ? That 's not a simple question . All right . - You ever been to Somalia ? - I can 't say I 've had the pleasure . What about Detroit ? Utah ? You 're wasting your energy on what caused the blackout , who 's responsible . You 're ignoring the most profound question of all . Why ? Do you know what a Black Swan is ? It 's a metaphor used to describe a high-impact event . Something so rare , it 's beyond the normal realm of human expectation . It comes from the 17th century , when scientists assumed that all swans were white . - They were wrong . - Fascinating . [ Speaking in foreign language ] " There 's a room . A small boy enters with a candle . " - What is this , a bedtime story ? - It 's a Sufi parable . The man in the room , referring to the candle , asks , " Tell me where this light comes from . " And the boy blows out the candle and replies , " If you tell me where this light went , I 'll tell you where it comes from . " Cute . Your partner 's right about one thing . I commune with some very dangerous people . I 'm friends with those willing to don suicide vests in the name of ideology . I know when a man is willing to sacrifice anything for his cause , and you 're not that kind of man , Agent Benford . Even if you were to start asking the right questions , you 're not willing to do what it takes to get the answers . You 're that little boy , Agent Benford . Alone in the dark . They want me to go ahead and see if I can do the analysis . [ Sighing ] - Hey , Al . - Hey , man . Hey . Remember that hacker , Mr. Cheeto-dust ? Give him a call . You sure ? Is Somalia really that important ? Yeah . It 's time I got out of the dark . Addison 's disease ? Who 's Addison ? Well ... he was the guy who discovered the condition . It 's a hormonal imbalance that makes surgery very dangerous . But , uh , luckily , Dr. Benford realized it in time and gave you the medication that saved your life . Wow . - Thanks , Dr. Varley . - Hey , we should thank you . Your flash forward helped us piece it together . If you hadn 't told us what you saw , you might have died on the table . It 's pretty cool . I wasn 't afraid because I didn 't need to be afraid . The future saved me . Ned 's crit is ... is stable . - Look , about earlier , I ... - Yeah , I was completely out of line . Yeah . But you were also right . I just didn 't wanna see what was going on with Ned ' cause of what 's going on with me , so . Look , I ... I get it . It 's what 's happening with me . That 's what made me believe him . Mm-hm . Bryce , I haven 't pushed you ' cause you didn 't wanna talk about the ... Me standing on the pier with a gun to my head ? I just want you to know that I 'm here if you wanna talk . Thanks , Dr. B. But , uh I 'm gonna be all right . You really think you 're just OK now ? I know I am . The future saved me . - [ Woman ] Dr. Benford ? - Hey . I need you to sign the discharge on the Rollerblade guy - so I can roll him out of here . - Sure . Oh , and Dylan Simcoe 's white count spiked to 19 . Here 's his CBC . He was transferred to physical therapy . Can you give it to his attending ? - The chief transferred him back . - What ? PT couldn 't handle the antibiotics , so the chief put him back on your service . Are you OK , Dr. Benford ? Yeah . Fine . [ Door closes ] Hey , Nicole . - [ Exhaling ] - What ? Charlie 's upstairs changing into her PJs . - All right . - We did some finger painting . She 's all done with her homework , and we kicked around the soccer ball . Oh , and she had ants on a log for a snack ... How are you doing ? I feel bad for disappearing on you . Everybody disappeared for a while . Some people aren 't even back yet . I guess I 'm just trying to figure out why you guys didn 't fire me . [ Chuckles ] Nicole , you 're part of the family . Hey , what 's the matter ? You want to talk about what happened ? You can , you know . I saw someone drowning me . What ? I saw someone drowning me . In my flash forward . I saw someone drowning me . And , I don 't understand , but I felt like I deserved what was happening . Like I 'd done something wrong , and there 's no other way out . And I saw the man 's face who was doing it . He pushed me back down , and ... And then I was just gone . What did I do that I think I deserved getting killed ? You don 't know exactly what you saw , or even how you felt . What person doesn 't care they 're being murdered ? Nicole , I 've known you a long time . You didn 't do anything wrong . And you won 't . Tomorrow , I 'm gonna have a detective friend of mine from the LAPD come talk to you . We 're not gonna let anything bad happen . I 'm gonna do whatever I have to to make sure you 're safe . All right ? That person you think you saw ... That person you 're worried you might be ... That 's not you . You think you can try to believe that ? - Yeah , I can try . - Good . - [ Charlie ] Hey , Daddy ! - Hey ! Come here , you ! [ grunts ] - Moons Over Miami . You in ? - I 'm in . - All right . Let 's get started . - Are you staying ? - Um , you know what ? I have to go . - [ Mark ] She 's staying . Breakfast for dinner ? Can 't beat that . - Come on , please ? - Sounds great . - Get cracking the eggs , professor . - OK . - Can I have a bowl , please ? - One bowl coming right up . - OK ! - Here . - [ Giggling ] That 's silly . - There you go . OK . - [ Giggling ] - Gamanta , McGillicutty , Frog-leg ! - Do you want the coin back ? - Yeah ! Well , say the magic words . - [ Dylan ] Do it again ! - [ Lloyd ] Are you ready ? - [ Woman ] See you tomorrow . - Good night , Deb . Gamanta , McGillicutty , - Frog-leg ! [ gasping ] - [ Lloyd ] Here you go . [ Dylan ] Do it again ! Just once more ! I think my junior magician has to get his strength up before the next trick . How about some dinner ? OK , Dad . [ Lloyd ] I 'll be right back . You 're the eye of newt soup , right ? [ Groans ] All right , chicken it is . [ Cell phone ringing ] - Yeah ? - [ Simon ] We need to talk . - Yeah , well , I can 't right now . - I 'm truly sorry about that , Lloyd . But talking to me is just one of those little inconveniences you 're going to have to put up with , now that we 're responsible for the single greatest disaster in human history .

Where would you getan idea like that ? I have a dog-eared copy of sudden evolution on my bookshelf . Here 's a sampleof the extinct genetic material . And yet here it is . Suggests to methat this animal is anything but what , extinct . The sea containsmany mysteries , doctor . - An underwater volcano . - A big one , I think . Enough to annihilateall marine life for 100 miles . This is where you firstencountered it . - The exact latitude . - Well , that can 't bea coincidence . I 'm sure it isn 'T . I wanted you to see this . To see that there areconsequences here beyond anyyou may have imagined .

That 's whenthe R.O.V. Melted . But not beforeit sent back this . Why don 't they burn upin the heat ? Perhaps it 's home . You mean that this istheir habitat ? Maybe the species isn 'ta sudden evolutionary mutation . Maybe they 've beendown there in the earth the whole time . is remarkable . In addition to facilitating dr . Singh 's recovery , we 've documented it , restoring diseased cellsat a nuclear level . No matter how we regulatedthe temperature , we were losingthe sample . Yeah . This image has beenslowed down so you can seethe deterioration . Millions of cells per second . It would 've been gone by dawn . We had no choice but to freeze it . Imagine the possibilities , davis . A new era of medicine . Maybe the endof disease . You knowyour problem , doctor ? You 're an optimist . National Oceanographic Sound Survey Hi , I 'm lookingfor wayne johnson . - You got him . - Hi , I 'm dr . Laura daughtery . - Hi . Affiliation ? Monterey oceanographic . Look , I was interestedin getting a recording from one of your hydrophonesa week or so back . Yeah , what for ? I was on a divethe other weekend sponsored by the institute , and we came across an animalthat , quite frankly , I couldn 't identify . Well , I got over 500 hydrophonesfrom reykjavik all the way tothe cape of good hope . So withoutspecific coordinates- - 46,15 north.129,53 west . - That 's near the san juande fuca . - Yes , sir . Yes , it is . - What date ? - September 19th . September 19th . Two guys came in here yesterday looking for the exactsame thing . You should be dead .

This allows them to survive such a hostile environment . Alex . What are you doing ? Nothing . Nothing . who the--who are these guys ? Both of themare civilians . But they had D.O.D.Credentials , and a subpoena to confiscatethe material . So they seized the sound file ? From the mic you 'retalking about , yeah . So so what 's the rangeon these mics ? 500 miles , give or take . So could I pull the sound filefrom the next mic up the chain ? Say , like , that one ? Do you know how loud an animalwould have to be in order to be audible underwater ... from a hundred miles away ? You haven 't heard the animalI 'm looking for . My head fell off ... it 's like a needlein a haystack . I 'll shoot ! You 're eating my head ! - Did you hear it ? - No . What 's it matteranyways ?

Rich . rich . all right , miles , it 's your turn to say grace . Heavenly father , please bless this food to thenourishment of our bodies.Amen. I think it would be niceif you said something meaningful during the blessing . Dear god , thank you for giving methe opportunities that you have . Thank youfor my loved one ... ones . I 'm trying notto get frustrated , even though I know most kidswould have given up by now . I knowthat through consistency and repetition , throughpositive reinforcement and not rewardingbad behavior that you 'll take careof everything .

Did you make the lightningflatten savannah 's playhouse ? Did you ? 12 hours , 16 bucks . So much for my thesis . Wrong bandwidth . I have you onthe wrong bandwidth . Cirko.It 's laura daughtery . I need you to listen to this.Okay , hear this . Do you hear that sound ? That is the species.I have it on tape . you shouldn 't be calling . Who is this ? I believe dr . Cirko gave yousome advice about pursuing this , dr . Daughtery . Is that what you call it ? " Advice " ? Is that what you call framingsomeone for plagiarism , taking their careeraway from them ? When are you guys gonna realizethat I am in it ? I am not going anywhere . I have proof . I have evidenceof a new life form on tape . Imagine a perfectlyevolved animal , mr . Lee . One that has ability to healitself instantaneously . And you 've replicatedthe results under controlledconditions ? Wasn 't this proof enough ? Nothing . Not a scratch . Such a speciesmight well be invincible . Imperviousto physical harm . Quite fascinating . I 'm not sure I share your enthusiasm . Wadham 's report came in . Complete thermogram of theentire san juan de fuca plate . Significant thermalhairline deterioration across the northern pacific . - The ocean 's heating up . - Yes . They dig , they release heat . The question , mr . Lee , is how much ? Old faithfulerupts more frequently than any of the otherbig geysers , although it 's not the largest or the most regular geyserin the park . The average intervalbetween eruptions is 91 minutes . Each eruption will expel between 3700 and 8400 gallons of boiling water , and reach heightsof 106 to 184 feet . Although the intervalbetween eruptions has lengthened dueto vandalism and earthquakes ... old faithful is still as predictable as it was a century ago .

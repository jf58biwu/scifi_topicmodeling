TROUBLE IS , I JUST CHAIRED A COMMITTEE , WHICH IS ABOUT TO ISSUE A 1600-PAGE REPORT , WHICH STATES , IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS , THAT I 'M LOSING THAT WAR AND YOU ARE WINNING IT . PROMICIN ISN 'T GOING AWAY . JORDAN COLLIER MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT . WELL , IF YOU 'RE HERE TO SIGN TERMS OF SURRENDER , I COULD HAVE SOME DRAWN UP . WHO 'S TALKING ABOUT SURRENDER ? I FOUGHT IN ' NAM . I HAVE THE MEDALS TO PROVE IT . AND LAST YEAR , I TOOK MY WIFE ON VACATION TO SAIGON . I FIGURE IF I CAN MAKE MY PEACE WITH CHARLIE , I CAN MAKE MY PEACE WITH YOU . THEY 'RE HOLDING A SPECIAL ELECTION TO FILL A VACANT SEAT ON THE SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL . I WANT YOU TO RUN FOR IT . CITY COUNCIL ? SENATOR , I 'M NOT A POLITICIAN . THE HELL YOU 'RE NOT . YOU STEPPED INTO THE SPOTLIGHT WHEN YOU REOPENED THIS CENTER . I WANT YOU TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU 'VE BEEN DOING HERE INTO SOMETHING MORE . YOU 'RE THE ALTERNATIVE WE NEED TO COLLIER AND HIS PROMICIN-PUSHING RADICALS . YOU CAN WALK THE MIDDLE PATH THAT WILL UNITE BOTH 4400s AND NON-4400s . AND THIS MIDDLE PATH ? YOU 'RE PLANNING ON WALKING IT WITH ME ? RIGHT DOWN THE CENTER . PROBABLY LOSE ANY CHANCE OF RE-ELECTION . MY ANTI-4400 COLLEAGUES WILL SEE TO THAT . BUT IT 'S WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS .

THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD . MAIA , WILL YOU GO TO BED NOW , PLEASE , SWEETIE ? HELP ME , DI . PLEASE , HELP ME . APRIL , DID YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THIS GUY , BARTON , WAS JUST GONNA HAND YOU OVER $ 60,000 ? SEEMED LIKE SUCH AN EASY MARK AND IT 'S ALWAYS WORKED BEFORE . OH , MY GOD , SO THAT 'S HOW YOU 'VE BEEN USING YOUR ABILITY ? TO BLACKMAIL PEOPLE . OH , GOD . DON 'T START LECTURING ME ON RIGHT AND WRONG . NO , IT 'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT . YEAH . IT IS . SO SAVE YOUR BREATH . ALL RIGHT , LADIES . LET 'S JUST CALM DOWN . LET 'S JUST STAY CALM , OKAY ? FOCUS ON WHAT 'S IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW . BARTON ? HE DID IT , RIGHT ? HE KILLED COLIN ? WELL , I WOULD SAY HE 'S OUR NUMBER ONE SUSPECT . BUT THIS $ 300,000 THAT ANEXXO 'S PAYING OUT IN BRIBE MONEY ... BARTON DIDN 'T HAPPEN TO MENTION WHERE IT WAS GOING ? DOES IT MATTER ? COLIN , THE WAY HE LOOKED LYING THERE ON THE FLOOR ... THE HOTEL SUITE . IT WAS IN COLIN 'S NAME , RIGHT ? YEAH . OR ONE OF HIS NAMES . HE USED A COUPLE . OKAY . AND WHEN THEY FIND THE BODY , THERE 'S NOTHING THERE TO CONNECT YOU TO IT , IS THERE ? I DON 'T THINK SO . BEN , WILL YOU STAY HERE ? I 'M GONNA DRIVE APRIL TO A MOTEL , OR SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM HERE AND AWAY FROM MAIA . I 'M SORRY , YOU 'LL HAVE TO STAY THERE UNTIL WE FIGURE THIS OUT . DI ? ARE YOU GOING TO TURN ME IN ? WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE THIS UP AS WE GO ALONG . [ KYLE ] : SO I CAN COUNT ON YOU , RIGHT ? IF MY DAD ASKS YOU , AND HE PROBABLY WILL ... KYLE , I 'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOUR DAD THAT YOU GAVE ME A PROMICIN SHOT . OKAY ? IT 'S HARD , YOU KNOW ? I MEAN , I LOVE THE GUY SO MUCH , BUT THE THINGS I 'M DOING , HE JUST WOULDN 'T UNDERSTAND . I GET IT , KYLE . I REALLY DO . IT 'S JUST I 'VE GOT ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF I 'M DEALING WITH . OH , YEAH . IF YOU MEAN ISABELLE TYLER , I DON 'T THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT FROM HER . SHE 'S PROBABLY LONG GONE FROM SEATTLE . THAT 'S GOOD TO KNOW . I 'LL FIRE THE EXTRA SECURITY I HAD ON . ANYWAY , I WASN 'T TALKING ABOUT HER . THIS IS GOING TO SOUND WEIRD . ROLAND LENHOFF WANTS ME TO RUN FOR A SEAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL . THE GUY BEHIND THE DINSTMAN-LENHOFF BILL ? HE SEES IT AS A " IF YOU CAN 'T BEAT ' EM , WORK WITH ' EM " KIND OF THING . AND HE KNOWS HE CAN 'T BEAT US . THAT 'S GREAT , SHAWN . YOU SAID YES , RIGHT ? I 'M THINKING ABOUT IT . YOU HAVE TO DO THIS . YOU GET ELECTED , THAT PUTS A 4400 INTO THE MAINSTREAM . THEY 'LL HAVE TO START TAKING US SERIOUSLY . AND WHO KNOWS , MAN ? YOU COULD BECOME MAYOR , MAYBE EVEN GOVERNOR . WHOA . JUST ONE STEP AT A TIME . I DON 'T EVEN KNOW IF I CAN GET ELECTED TO CITY COUNCIL . YOU HEAL PEOPLE WITH YOUR HANDS . SHOW ME AN OPPONENT WHO CAN BEAT THAT . DO YOU WANNA BE MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER ? NO . BUT YOU GOT MY VOTE . THAT 'S ONE . NOT A PROBLEM . I 'LL HAVE THE TEST RESULTS BACK TOMORROW . WHAT NAME DO I LOG THE SAMPLES UNDER ? NO NAME . BUT WHAT IF THEY COME BACK PROMICIN POSITIVE ? NO NAME , MARCO . I WANT ANY PAPERWORK HANDED TO ME AND ME ALONE . ARE WE CLEAR ? ACTUALLY , TOM , I STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS . DO ME THIS FAVOR , PLEASE . BUT I WON 'T ASK THEM . THANK YOU . HEY , MARCO . THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE DOWN HERE , TOM . HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE ? YEAH , YEAH , SURE . I KNOW MY SISTER 'S MADE A LOT OF BAD CHOICES IN HER LIFE , BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT APRIL WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN THAT SHOT IF IT WEREN 'T FOR ME . I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR SISTER , DIANA , BUT IF SHE KNOWS THE IDENTITY OF A MURDERER- - I CAN 'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING APRIL TO PRISON , TOM . SHE 'S PROMICIN POSITIVE . IT 'S A LIFE SENTENCE . YOU KNOW THE DEAL . BESIDES , I MEAN , THERE 'S A CHANCE THAT THE POLICE COULD GET TO BARTON ON THEIR OWN . YEAH , BUT WHAT IF THEY DON 'T ? WHAT THEN ? THEN I 'LL TELL THE AUTHORITIES EVERYTHING I KNOW . AFTER I 'VE BOUGHT APRIL A ONE-WAY TICKET TO MARRAKECH . APRIL ? APRIL SKOURIS , RIGHT ? YEAH . I 'M A FRIEND OF COLIN 'S BROTHER , JEFF . JEFF ? NO , I 'M LARRY , BUT JEFF HEARD WHAT HAPPENED AND HE SENT ME HERE TO GET YOU OUT OF SEATTLE . REALLY ? WELL , WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GO ? MY CAR 'S RIGHT OUT BACK . WE 'RE GOING TO GO TO PHOENIX . WHAT ABOUT MY CLOTHES ? WELL , YOU CAN GET SOME NEW ONES , OKAY ? IF WE HURRY , WE CAN CATCH THE NEXT FLIGHT . WAIT , PHOENIX ? JEFF MOVED TO FLORIDA . IT REALLY DOESN 'T MATTER . OH , MY GOD , HELP ! HE 'S TRYING TO KILL ME ! DI , I REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON BECAUSE NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE . WHY KILL COLIN ? WHY COME AFTER ME ? WE NEVER GOT OUR HANDS ON ANY OF THAT MONEY . WELL , THAT BRIBE MONEY THAT ANEXXO IS PAYING OUT , THEY CLEARLY DON 'T WANT ANYONE KNOWING ABOUT IT . I GUESS IT 'S TIME WE HAVE A TALK WITH THIS PETER BARTON GUY . YEAH . I 'M COMING WITH YOU . YOU WANT THE TRUTH ? I CAN GET IT FOR YOU . YOU SURE ABOUT THAT ? I MEAN , PEOPLE BEAT LIE DETECTORS ALL THE TIME . TOM , DO YOU LIKE MY SISTER ? DIANA ? YEAH , SURE . SHE 'S MY PARTNER , MY FRIEND . EVER HAD A SEXUAL FANTASY ABOUT HER ? WELL , ONCE OR TWICE . WE WERE WORKING LATE . DIANA MENTIONED WE WERE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WORKING IN THE BUILDING- - YOU CAN COME . PETER BARTON , I 'M AGENT BALDWIN . THIS IS AGENT SKOURIS . WE 'RE WITH NTAC . OH , GOD , NOT HER . YOU MURDERED COLIN , DIDN 'T YOU ? MURDERED ? NO . I WASN 'T EVEN IN THE ROOM WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND SHOWED UP . THE MONEY . IT WASN 'T ME YOU WERE TRYING TO BLACKMAIL . IT WAS THE CORPORATION . I HAD TO WARN THEM . THE BRIBE MONEY . WHO 'D YOU PASS IT OFF TO ? I TELL YOU THAT , I LOSE MY JOB . WHAT WAS HIS NAME , PETER ? ALEX LUPONE . HE 'S THE DIRECTOR OF ADVANCED COMBAT SYSTEMS FOR THE PENTAGON . ASK HIM WHY ANEXXO WAS PAYING LUPONE . DON 'T . JUST DON 'T . ANEXXO WON A CONTRACT TO DEVELOP A NEW INTERCEPTOR BALLISTIC BODY ARMOR FOR THE MILITARY . IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPENETRABLE . SO THIS BODY ARMOR , IT WAS DEFECTIVE ? THERE WERE SOME DESIGN FLAWS WHICH LEFT PARTS OF THE SIDE AND SHOULDERS UNPROTECTED . I WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY OFF LUPONE TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY . YOU INTERFERED , AND IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF MY HANDS . WHO DID YOU TELL ABOUT COLIN AND APRIL ? DONALD MITCHELL . HE SITS ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS . HE CALLED ME PERSONALLY TO HANDLE THE PAYOFF . FLEW ME OUT HERE ON ANEXXO 'S DIME . WHERE CAN WE FIND MITCHELL ? HE 'S STAYING AT THE DORCHESTER HOTEL . I DIDN 'T KNOW ANYONE WAS GONNA DIE . I DON 'T LIKE STANDING UP HERE AND CALLING ROLAND LENHOFF A LIAR , BUT THE TRUTH IS , HE 'S BEEN ONE FOR 40 YEARS . HE DID NOT SINGLE-HANDEDLY HOLD OFF A PLATOON OF VIET CONG TROOPS WHILE HIS MEN LAY WOUNDED AROUND HIM . I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN . TURN THAT DAMNED THING OFF . THAT BRAVE ACT WAS PERFORMED BY STAFF SERGEANT STEPHEN- - GUESS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HEARD THAT YOU AND I WERE MEETING . DIDN 'T WASTE ANY TIME LETTING ME KNOW THEY WEREN 'T REAL HAPPY ABOUT IT . SENATOR , I HAVE TO ASK , DID YOU FALSIFY YOUR WAR RECORD ? NO , I DID NOT . THAT FELLOW WHO GAVE THAT LITTLE SPEECH ... I SAVED HIS LIFE THAT DAY . THEY MUST 'VE PAID HIM A LOT OF MONEY TO GET HIM TO LIE LIKE THAT . WELL , I GUESS IF WHAT HE SAYS ISN 'T TRUE , THEN IT DOESN 'T REALLY MATTER . DOESN 'T HAVE TO BE TRUE . IT 'S ON THE TELEVISION . I CAN TOUGH THIS OUT . THE QUESTION IS , CAN YOU ? BECAUSE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE GIVING YOU THE SAME KIND OF TREATMENT . IF NOT WORSE . PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING LIES ABOUT ME EVER SINCE WE CAME BACK IN THAT BALL OF LIGHT , SO ... DOES THAT MEAN YOU 'LL RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL ? IT MEANS I 'M GONNA RUN AND I 'M GONNA WIN . THAT 'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR . I KNEW I PICKED MYSELF THE RIGHT MAN . SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW ? WELL , THE FIRST THING YOU GOT TO DO IS LET PEOPLE KNOW WHERE YOU STAND . THAT MEANS TELLING THE WORLD YOU 'RE AGAINST JORDAN COLLIER AND EVERYTHING THAT HE 'S BEEN DOING . YOU WANT TO WIN THIS ELECTION ? THEN JORDAN COLLIER IS THE ENEMY . YOUR ENEMY . HEY , KYLE . HEY . HOW 'S IT COMING ? I 'M TRYING TO DECIPHER THESE CODED PAGES , BUT I 'M NOT A CRYPTOGRAPHER . CAN I HAVE A LOOK ? I MAY HAVE LOST MY ABILITIES , BUT I DID READ THE ENCYCLOPEDIA FROM A TO Z. AND YOU REMEMBER ALL OF IT ? YEAH , PRETTY MUCH . HOW ARE YOU WITH PUZZLES ? WELL , I GUESS WE 'LL SEE . BUT YOU DID SAY YOU BROUGHT ME HERE FOR A REASON , RIGHT ? THAT I 'M PART OF ALL THIS . SO MAYBE THIS IS MY CHANCE TO PROVE IT . I DON 'T CARE WHAT PETER BARTON CLAIMS . ANEXXO DOESN 'T BRIBE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS . THAT 'S NOT THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS . MR. MITCHELL , DID YOU AUTHORIZE THE PAYMENT OF $ 300,000 TO ALEX LUPONE ? I DID NOT . WE NEVER PAID ALEX LUPONE A PENNY . NOW , IF YOU 'LL EXCUSE ME , I HAVE AN $ 80 KOBE BEEF FILET GROWING COLD ON THE PLATE . THEN WHAT WAS THE MONEY FOR ? IT WAS A DOWN PAYMENT . A DOWN PAYMENT FOR WHAT ? TO HAVE ALEX LUPONE MURDERED . I DIDN 'T MEAN THAT . I DON 'T KNOW WHY I 'D SAY SUCH A THING . WHY HAVE LUPONE KILLED ? I 'M NOT ANSWERING ANY MORE QUESTIONS . WAS IT BECAUSE YOU WERE SELLING THE MILITARY DEFECTIVE BODY ARMOR ? LUPONE WOULD HAVE EXPOSED US . WE HAD NO CHOICE . I 'M CALLING MY LAWYER . NO . NOT TILL YOU CANCEL THE HIT ON LUPONE . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . HOW DO WE REACH LUPONE ? WHAT IS HIS PHONE NUMBER ? THERE ISN 'T ONE . HE 'S ON VACATION IN THE BRAZILIAN JUNGLE . THE MEN WE HIRED ARE ALREADY DOWN THERE . I HAVE NO WAY OF CONTACTING THEM . IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY ? ABSOLUTELY , IT IS . SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW ? WELL , WE 'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH THE BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES AND HOPE THAT THEY GET IN TOUCH WITH LUPONE FIRST . BUT IN THE MEANTIME , I 'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO COME INTO NTAC AND MAKE SURE THAT MITCHELL REPEATS HIS CONFESSION FOR THE RECORD . I CAN 'T DO THAT . I WALK INTO NTAC , I DON 'T COME OUT . NO , I 'LL SPEAK TO MEGHAN . WE 'LL EXPLAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCES . WHAT IF THAT DOESN 'T WORK ? I CAN 'T TAKE THAT CHANCE . APRIL , WITHOUT SOME COAXING FROM YOUR ABILITY , MITCHELL IS GOING TO DENY EVERYTHING HE JUST TOLD US . HE 'S GOING TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER . HE 'S GOING TO GET AWAY WITH COLIN 'S MURDER . DO YOU WANT THAT ? LOOK , I CAN 'T DO THAT . I 'M SORRY . APRIL , YOU 'VE BEEN RUNNING AWAY YOUR ENTIRE LIFE . FROM YOUR FAMILY , FROM SCHOOL , FROM RESPONSIBILITY . AND I DON 'T KNOW , MAYBE I 'M ... MAYBE I 'M TO BLAME FOR THAT . MAYBE I PUSHED YOU AWAY . MAYBE I WASN 'T THERE FOR YOU . I DON 'T KNOW . BUT THIS TIME ... THIS TIME , YOU CAN 'T RUN AWAY . ? ALL RIGHT ? DO U THINK ? IS READY TO VOTE FOR A 4400 ? WELL , I 'M HOPING SO , BEING THERE 'S A LOT MORE NON-4400s OUT THERE THAN PEOPLE WITH ABILITIES . BUT MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING THE SHOT ALL THE TIME . HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT ? DO YOU AGREE WITH JORDAN COLLIER 'S DECISION TO HAND OUT PROMICIN TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS IT ? NO . I DON 'T . HALF OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE . THOUSANDS ALREADY HAVE . ARE YOU CALLING JORDAN COLLIER A MASS MURDERER ? I THINK THAT JORDAN SHOULD 'VE WAITED UNTIL THE ODDS OF SURVIVAL WERE BETTER THAN 50 / 50 . A LOT BETTER THAN 50 / 50 . IF HE WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD , THERE ARE SAFER WAYS OF DOING SO . LIKE RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL ? WELL , THAT 'S A START ANYWAY . [ DIANA ] : APRIL , IT 'S ME . GO AWAY . NOT UNTIL WE 'VE TALKED . NOW JUST LET ME IN . NO . COME ON , OPEN UP . SO WHERE DO YOU GO NOW ? I REALLY HADN 'T THOUGHT THAT FAR AHEAD . I NEVER DO , DO I ? MAYBE THIS TIME YOU SHOULD . YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING FUNNY ? I THOUGHT WHEN I GOT THIS ABILITY , IT WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE . AND IT DID . CHANGED MY CIRCUMSTANCES ANYWAY . I GOT BETTER CLOTHES . I EAT IN BETTER RESTAURANTS . FLY FIRST-CLASS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE . BUT IT DIDN 'T CHANGE ME . NO ABILITY IS GOING TO DO THAT . YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOURSELF . AND YOU CAN . HOW ? BY MARCHING INTO NTAC ? THAT WOULD BE BRAVE . EXCEPT I 'M NOT BRAVE , AM I ? ANOTHER ONE OF MY MANY FAULTS . APRIL . IT 'S NOT TOO LATE . YOU CAN STILL BE THE PERSON THAT YOU WANT TO BE . LOOK , I CAN 'T SAY THAT I APPROVE OF WHAT YOU 'VE BEEN UP TO . BUT YOU DID SAY THAT YOU LOVED THIS GUY , COLIN . AND IF YOU DID , IF THAT 'S TRUE , THEN YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP FOR HIM . AND ONLY YOU CAN DO THAT . THE MAN IS GUILTY OF MULTIPLE FELONIES AND HE 'S THREATENING TO SUE US ? MITCHELL 'S CLAIMING HARASSMENT , INTIMIDATION , OH , AND FALSE ARREST . AND ANEXXO 'S LAWYERS HAVE THE MUSCLE TO MAKE A CASE LIKE THIS STICK . COME ON , MEGHAN . HE 'S RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE MURDER WE KNOW OF , HE PLOTTED TWO OTHERS , AND HIS CORPORATION IS TRYING TO DEFRAUD THE U.S. GOVERNMENT , AND WE 'RE JUST GONNA LET HIM WALK ? TOM , YOU TELL ME THIS GUY DESERVES TO BE LOCKED UP AND I 'LL BELIEVE YOU , BUT I NEED MORE THAN YOUR WORD . I NEED THAT WOMAN , THE ONE THAT GOT HIS INITIAL CONFESSION . LOOK , I KNOW SHE 'S PROMICIN POSITIVE , BUT YOU NEED TO CONVINCE HER TO COME FORWARD . YEAH , WELL , I DON 'T THINK THAT 'S GONNA HAPPEN . WELL , THEN THERE 'S NO WAY WE 'RE GOING TO GET AN INDICTMENT AGAINST MITCHELL . NOT WITHOUT PROOF . I HAVE THE PROOF YOU NEED RIGHT HERE . SHAWN . HEY , KYLE . EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ? NO , IT 'S NOT . I 'M DRIVING IN MY CAR , TURN ON THE RADIO , AND I HEAR YOU TELL THE WORLD THAT JORDAN COLLIER 'S A MASS MURDERER . THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID . I SAID THAT HE WAS WRONG TO HAND OUT PROMICIN . AND THAT 'S WHAT I BELIEVE . EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE , THIS BUILDING YOU 'RE STANDING IN , YOU OWE IT ALL TO JORDAN . YOU 'RE WILLING TO BETRAY HIM FOR SOME VOTES ? HEY , I BUILT THIS PLACE JUST AS MUCH AS JORDAN . HE USED MY HEALING ABILITIES TO RAISE MONEY FOR IT . HE USED ME FOR A LOT OF THINGS . NOT ANYMORE . I 'M MY OWN MAN NOW . I MAKE MY OWN CHOICES . WELL , YOU 'RE OFF TO A GREAT START . YOU 'RE NOT ONLY BETRAYING JORDAN , YOU 'RE BETRAYING YOURSELF . YOU 'RE A TRAITOR , SHAWN . DON 'T YOU SEE THAT ? DON 'T YOU SEE THAT ? TRAITOR . HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN ? SINCE THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED , ABOUT 10 MINUTES . SINCE YOUR SISTER 'S BEEN IN THERE WITH MITCHELL , ABOUT TWO HOURS . MITCHELL 'S BEEN WITH ANEXXO FOR WHAT , 14 YEARS ? IMAGINE THE SECRETS HE 'S SAVED UP . WE COULD BE HERE ALL NIGHT . WE GOT A SIGNED CONFESSION . WHETHER IT HOLDS UP IN COURT REMAINS TO BE SEEN , BUT WE 'VE GOT ENOUGH AGAINST HIM THAT AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THESE CHARGES SHOULD STICK . AND APRIL ? I 'M SORRY , DIANA . WE HAVE TO TAKE HER INTO CUSTODY . IT 'S OKAY , DI . EVERYTHING 'S OKAY . I ? ? GO FOR IT EITHER . YOU MUST 'VE BEEN PRETTY CONVINCING . EXCUSE ME , I 'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT . BUT I HAVE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT AND WHAT WE 'RE DOING TO APRIL JUST ISN 'T FAIR . SHE DIDN 'T HAVE TO COME FORWARD . MITCHELL COULD BE A FREE MAN RIGHT NOW , INSTEAD OF HAVING HIS PICTURE PLASTERED ALL OVER THE PAPERS . SHE DID THE RIGHT THING , AND WE 'RE LOCKING HER UP ? WE NEED TO OFFER HER SOME KIND OF AMNESTY , NOT PUNISH HER . SKOURIS , WE 'RE NOT PUNISHING HER . WE 'RE HIRING HER . ACCORDING TO MEGHAN , NTAC ... THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S OFFICE ... THE FBI ... THEY 'RE ALREADY FIGHTING OVER WHO GETS ME WHEN . AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS ASK PEOPLE QUESTIONS . IT 'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE AT A BAR OVER DRINKS . SOME OF THE PEOPLE YOU MEET AND THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO ASK ... SOME OF THE ANSWERS YOU 'RE GOING TO HEAR ... IT CAN GET PRETTY UGLY . MEGHAN WAS PRETTY UPFRONT ABOUT THAT . STILL , IT 'S GOTTA BE BETTER THAN PRISON . I MUST SAY , THE PERKS ARE PRETTY GOOD . I GET AN APARTMENT , A NICE SALARY , HEALTH INSURANCE , EVEN A CLOTHING ALLOWANCE . AND LET 'S NOT FORGET ERIC AND RALPH . OR IS IT RALPH AND ERIC ? I 'M SURE YOU 'LL FIGURE IT OUT . THEIR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE I SHOW UP WHEREVER I NEED TO BE . KNOWING ME , IT WON 'T BE AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS . YOU THINK I 'M GONNA SCREW THIS UP , DON 'T YOU ? APRIL , MAYBE THE QUESTION YOU SHOULD BE ASKING ME IS IF I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED , AND THE ANSWER IS A DEFINITE YES . WELL , I 'LL TRY NOT TO LET EITHER ONE OF US DOWN . AND I PROMISE TO CALL OR EMAIL AND LET YOU KNOW HOW I 'M DOING . SO ... WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING ? YOU KNOW , FOR SPAIN , OR WHEREVER YOU GUYS DECIDE ? I 'M NOT LEAVING . I 'M STAYING RIGHT HERE IN SEATTLE . DID I JUST SAY THAT ? DOES BEN KNOW ? NO . I HADN 'T REALIZED IT UNTIL JUST NOW . YOU 'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL HIM . YEAH . I 'M REALLY HAPPY FOR BOTH OF YOU . BUT WE 'RE NOT LEAVING THIS TABLE UNTIL WE 'VE MADE A DECISION . ARE WE LIVING IN FRANCE OR SPAIN ? NEITHER . DIANA ? DON 'T HATE ME , BEN . PLEASE . OH , GOD ... I QUIT WORK . I WENT TO SPAIN . I TRIED . I REALLY TRIED . BUT I BELONG HERE . WITH TOM , AND WITH NTAC , THE SEARCH FOR COLLIER . I 'M A PART OF THAT . MY DAUGHTER 'S A PART OF THAT . AND NOW MY SISTER IS , TOO . SO WHAT HAPPENS TO US ? WE GO BACK TO OUR OWN LIVES ? BACK TO OUR WORK ? WHAT , SEE EACH OTHER A FEW DAYS A MONTH ? FOR NOW . WE COULD HAVE SO MUCH MORE , DIANA . MAIA SAID THAT WE 'D GET MARRIED . AND MAIA 'S NEVER WRONG . WELL , I HOPE NOT . ME TOO . THE LAB REPORT YOU ASKED FOR . THE ONE AND ONLY COPY . SAMPLES CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR PROMICIN . SOMEONE 'S DEFINITELY WALKING AROUND WITH AN ABILITY . THANKS , MARCO . [ KYLE ] : " WHEN THE CHOSEN HAVE TAKEN THE ELIXIR " AND PROVED THEIR FAITH IN THE MESSIAH , " THEN ALL WILL FOLLOW IN THEIR WAKE . " ONLY THEN WILL THE FATHER REVEAL HIS TRUE FACE , AND PARADISE AND THE WORLD WILL BE AS ONE . " I THINK THAT 'S A PRETTY ACCURATE TRANSLATION . THE ELIXIR , THAT 'S GOTTA BE PROMICIN . AND WE KNOW COLLIER 'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE MESSIAH . AND THE FATHER ? I DON 'T KNOW . GOD , I GUESS ? BUT WHO ARE THE CHOSEN ? FLIP THE PAGE . IT 'S A LIST OF NAMES . YEAH . 200 IN ALL . AND MOST OF THEM YOU 'LL RECOGNIZE . POLITICIANS , SCIENTISTS , ATHLETES ... THESE PEOPLE , THEY 'RE ALL ALIVE TODAY . BUT THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN 85 YEARS AGO . I KNOW . ALL RIGHT , SO ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE THE SHOT ? AND THAT 'S SUPPOSED TO INFLUENCE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME , RIGHT ? UNTIL WHAT ? EVERYONE HAS AN ABILITY ? THOSE WHO SURVIVE , ANYWAY . AND THAT 'S WHEN GOD 'S SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP ? I THINK YOU 'D BETTER LOOK AT THE LAST NAME .

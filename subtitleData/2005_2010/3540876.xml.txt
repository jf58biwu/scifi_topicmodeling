 - Previously on warehouse 13 ... - Can we get back to the warehouse computers Being breached ? Somebody is poking around in your system . - I should never have told you . Warehouse 13 . I got hacked . - Does artie seem a little , I don 't know , crankier than usual ? - Who 's there ? Someone 's there . I can hear- - What the hell was that ? - Artie , what are you gonna do ? I know this place . I know this place . - Yes . You 've been here before . You don 't remember it , but you will . - Ahh . So this is a dream ? - It 's time to get up , artie . It 's time to go . - W-Where ? Where am I going ? - Back to the beginning . - Yeah ? - No more zoos , okay ? From now on , if an artifact is at a zoo , We leave it there . - Monkey 's spit . Artie , do you know that ? They--They spit , and it is not pleasant . - Guys , guys , guys- - - Tell him about the cheetahs . - No , I don 't want to think about the cheetahs , right ? I just--I just- - I want a bath . - All right , I 'm sorry about all that . I 'm dealing with a lot here too , okay ? - Oh , right . Have you found out who 's hacking into the warehouse ? - I can 't pinpoint the origin of the breach . It 's a little frustrating . - Sleep . Artie , you look- - You look terrible . - Thank you very much . You still have some monkey phlegm in your hair . - It 's not- - - Is that- - - It 's not phlegm . - Look , artie , uh , just- - Myka 's right . Get some rest , bro , okay ? - Look , just get back here as soon as possible . We have a lot to do . Okay ? Oh , no , I-I can 't get up . - Yes , you can . Try . - I can 't . - How 'd you get in here ? - I 'm disappointed , artie . I figured you 'd have me totally clocked by now . - I don 't--I don 't- - Do I know you ? What 's going on ? - Oh , I 'm hurt . Well , it was a while ago . I was a lot younger , so were you . Looking for this ? Dude , an alarm system ? So not groovy . Besides , this is you-And-Me time right now . Yeah , it 's funny . Years ago , I swear you said you were just a simple professor . I guess you left out the , uh , off-The-Grid , Top-Secret warehouse full of madcap . Claudia . Claudia donovan . You 're the breach . - Knock , knock . - Yeah , uh , I 'm sorry . I really don 't have time for games , And these cuffs , they 're not gonna stop me . - Oh , I know , but check this . - It 's supercharged cuffs , see ? 20,000 volts . Designed it myself . You like ? - Well done . - Thank you . Now chill . I 'm not in the mood . Kid , look , that was a long , long , long time ago , that stuff . - Time flies , professor . It really does . - I 'm not responsible for Joshua 's death . Claudia , look , just stop it right now Before you do something you regret . - I regret ? Me ? Oh , have you got it back-Asswards . You 're responsible for what happened . But , hey , it 's all good . You know why ? 'Cause it 's payback time for me and for Joshua . So let 's go , artie . Time to make good on your promise . - The door 's open . - That 's not good . - Artie would never leave his farnsworth . - Yeah . If there were trouble , artie would have triggered the- - - Alarm ? - Damn it ! I don 't know what else to do . The cache is wiped , there 's no tracks outside , And there 's no clues in here . - All right , don 't worry , okay ? We 'll figure it out somehow ? - Don 't worry ? [ Farnsworth buzzes ] Could that be artie ? - I 'm calling for artie . You two are decidedly not he . - Mrs. Frederic , hi . Oh , look , we got some really bad news . - Look , artie 's gone . Someone took him . - That doesn 't happen . Agents don 't get taken out of the warehouse . Our security system is- - - Oh . - I see . The person who 's breached the security , He 's taken artie . - Yeah , any idea who this guy is ? - None . - So can we put out an apb or alert the authorities ? - We are the authorities . What did you learn from the durational spectrometer ? - The spectro- - - It shows the afterimages Of anyone who 's been in the room in the last five hours . - you kidding me ? Yeah , that 's , like , our favorite thing , With all the lights and so forth . - Once you 've I.D. ' D them , let me know . And stay put . I don 't need three missing agents . - Oh , okay , but , mrs . Frederic , look , If we have a lead , we could just- - - Consider yourself under lockdown . - I know this place . It 's a lab . It 's Joshua 's old lab . - Come on . Away from the door . - I 'm fine right here . - Think so ? - Uh , or there . There is very good too . You 're doing this all wrong , Claudia . Brought me here in daylight , used my car . These are amateur moves , Claudia , and for what ? What are you gonna do to me ? You gonna kill me because a long , long time ago , Your brother died in an accident ? Come on . - He 's not dead . - Claudia ? Claudia , it was a terrible , terrible accident , But we both witnessed it , and he 's gone . - No , no , no , no . He 's not . He 's stuck . - Listen to yourself . - No , this isn 't in my head ! You 're gonna see . - Be careful . - Okay , okay . Um , let 's- - Let 's open this baby up , See what she 's got . That 's cool . Wow . Okay . - That is crazy . - All right . Okay . - Wow . Okay . - Okay . - Strange person of authority . - Who is that ? - I don 't know . - Who- - - Hold on . - Who is that ? - Hang on . I don 't know . Hang on . - Do you have it ? - Okay , yes . Here we go , here we go , here we go . Okay , there we go . And ... that 's- - Okay , that 's weird . Did you see that ? - Was he saying something ? What did- - What is he saying ? Do you--Yeah . Go--Go--Yeah . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . That 's a trip . - It 's--I can 't . - " Claudia donovan . " - How did you- - - My sister taught me how to read lips . - Why does your sister ... ? - Uh , the deaf find it handy . - You- - - Okay , Claudia donovan ... Where are you now ? - Mrs. Frederic said we should stay here . - Really ? I didn 't hear that . - Neither did I. - Uh-Oh , looks like she was institutionalized . - What if she 's dangerous , pete ? - So , okay , this is what ? This is poetic justice , Bringing me back where it all started ? - No , we 're here because it 's strongest here . We need that if you 're gonna bring Joshua back . - Back ? You did a nice job on these , by the way . What 's conducting the charge ? Is that a lithium filament ? It 's very fine craftsmanship . - Dude , just shut it down . Dude , can we not ? - Claudia , you are- - You are not well . All right . Joshua 's death Was ... He got the rules wrong , Claudia . - Yeah , ' cause he got sloppy , didn 't he , right ? We both know why he did that , don 't we , artie ? - Is Claudia in some kind of trouble with the secret service ? - In the four years that Claudia lived here , Did she ever give you any problems ? - No , not at all . She was very nice . - Well , what can you tell us about Claudia ? - Well , I 'm not one to gossip , but you might not know . She lost her parents when she was just a child . Poor thing . Her brother raised her . Then a few years later , he passed too . Can you believe it ? More bad luck than a turtle on his back . She went off to live with a foster family . Well , if you ask me , I think it all just finally hit her . - And then six months ago , she checked herself Into a psychiatric-Care clinic . - You know about that ? Of course you do . You 're the government . You probably know what pills I take in the morning . Anyway , she keeps up on her rent . - She checked herself out two months ago . Has she contacted you ? - Well , no , I haven 't seen her . - She 's got a home base somewhere . - Did she ever , um- - Did she ever stay with friends ? - I don 't think so . She kept to herself . No boyfriends , no girlfriends . I 'm very nonjudgmental . Here we are . - Thank you , mrs . Richman . We 'll just take a look around . - I guess I can trust the secret service . - Oh , boy . I 'm guessing this is the brother . - Uh , I don 't want to sound like a broken record , But what makes you think that Joshua 's still alive ? - ' Cause dead people don 't visit , einstein . - Oh , he--He visits you ? - Yeah , a lot lately . - Your brother Joshua visits you , And he tells you he 's not dead ? - Yes . I 'm not appreciating the snark , by the way . - Rheticus was right , you know ? His theories ? - No , no . - Joshua was right too . He was this close to proving it . - No , rheticus ' experiments were never re-created . Never . He was nuts ! Joshua 's gone . - You are gonna be so put down when he gets here . - Yeah ? Well , you know , I 'll take my chances . - God . It 's about the minerals , professor , The minerals in the metal . That 's what should have made it all work . - Sure . You know what I 'm sensing here ? That this is kind of a private chat . Some brother-Sister thing . What do you need me for ? - [ Sighs ] Because I took it as far as I could , And now I need you to help me bring him home . You made me a promise . - Something 's wrong . - That 's what I 've been saying , you fossil . God . - Something 's wrong . I can 't- - I can 't- - I can 't- - - Professor , I 'm Joshua donovan . - Joshua ? Are- - Yeah , I remember this . This is when I met you . - We 've met before ? - Yes . No . Well , you showed me your experiment . You thought I was here to give you a grant , and ... - That been happening a lot ? - What ? - You went back . - N-No . - I have the visions too . We 're mad connected , artie . The difference between us is ... I-I-I didn 't ignore them . - What 's wrong ? - What 's the matter with you , Claudia ? - It usually happens just before . - Just before what ? - You 're gonna want to sit down for this . He 's here . - Joshua ! - What is that ? What is happening ? - Joshua ! - Joshua ? Joshua ! Told ya . - What the hell was that ? I don 't--I-I don 't understand what just happened . What 's going on ? I mean , what the hell was that ? - That was Joshua . - No . - Yeah . You saw it too . I 'm not crazy . - Yes . Yes , I sa--I-I saw Joshua . How ? - Because he 's not dead . Now you know it too . Help me bring him back . - Well , I-I-I wouldn 't know where to start . - Well , I 've got everything here . The feldkirch minerals , equipment for an electric field . - Claudia , did you try to re-Create Joshua 's experiment on your own ? Oh , you 're such a creaker . Yeah , of course I did . The question is , why didn 't you ? - So far , none of this stuff is telling me Where Claudia might have taken artie . Are you finding anything ? - For a kid , she seems pretty focused on the 16th century . She 's definitely a thinker . - Always dangerous . - Rheticus . - Rheti-Who ? - He was a , uh , mathematician and mapmaker , A student of copernicus . Yes , pete , I read books growing up . - Right . Why go to the prom ? - Of course you did . - Yeah , three times in one night . - Mm . - It 's a long story . - I bet it is . I bet it is . Well , it looks like our girl genius Took something with her . - Just- - You know , just to clarify , You decided to re-Create a clearly dangerous , Potentially deadly experiment ? - Oh , sure . It sounds bad when you say it like that . - Claudia , these are very real forces That you 're playing with here . And if you stop to think- - - Chill out , obi-Wan , okay ? I 'm trying to save my brother 's life here . I really hope that we are trying to save it together . Look , I 've spent the last two years of my life Trying to figure out what happened to Joshua . And when I reached the end of what I could do , I just kind of sort of took a peek at your research . - W-What ? You took a peek ? You hacked Into highly classified government files . - Ooh , I 'm all puckered . You know , imagine my surprise when I discovered That you had done nothing to help him . In 12 years , nada . - I thought he was dead . - Oops . Wrong . Now you can help . Don 't tell me you don 't want to . I know you have guilt . - Hey . Hey , look at me ! I don 't . - Whatever helps you sleep at night , professor . - Hey , you all right ? - I 'm fine . Lay off . - Oh , yeah , you 're fine . Yeah , sure . The nosebleed is , what , just for fun ? - Oh , damn it . I 've been jamming for answers . I 'm just a little burned out . - Yeah , and then I 'm just gonna guess That it 's getting a little worse ? - Uh , o-Okay . It 's , like , three or four times a week now . But it 's just stress . I mean , you get stressed , you get the flu . Everybody knows that . - It 's not the flu , dummy . You 're so close to this , You can 't see that it 's your connection to the experiment That 's making you sick . - No , please . It 's--It 's just- - It 's ... - It 's just ... Yeah . Rheticus was attempting human teleportation , So was Joshua . It 's beyond dangerous . Look , it 'll be ... A little easier for me to see what you 've got If you took off the cuffs . - " When love is lost and loss oe 'rtakes me , " The rules of love then are hidden ; " And chaos rules and order lost , And hidden then , my heart , from love . " - Hey . What is that ? - Nothing . Um , nothing . It 's not important . - Hey . - Hmm ? - Um , a compass . Rheticus claimed he owned it , only no one ever saw it . It says here it probably never existed . It 's just ... Folklore . - Okay , now , is it just me , Or does that sound all artifact-Y ? - Well , you 've got the feldkirch minerals , And you 're using an electrical field , But what about the rest ? The compass , it disappeared with Joshua . My question is , what are you using instead of the compass ? - Aren 't the minerals enough ? - Uh-Uh . - It 's the same as the metal in the compass . It 's the same thing . - Uh-Uh . You can 't just replace an artifact With , you know , something else . There 's always an " x " factor . - Okay , which is maybe why I need your help , - Which is why you shouldn 't have done this at all . I 'm shutting you down . - No , hey , hey ! You said you were gonna help me . - What I said was I would look , Which I now have . And believe me , shutting you down ... That is helping you . - Okay , fine . You know what ? Fine . Just do it . Just shut me down . You abandoned him once . Why shouldn 't you do it again ? - It isn 't like that . - Oh , no , it 's exactly like that ! Joshua and me on our own again . It 's a good thing I 'm used to it . - I know that it hasn 't been easy . No . No , it hasn 't been easy . He was all I had after our parents died , And then he was gone too . He spent his fun years Sewing girl scout patches And teaching me how to fold an omelet ... And then reading maria looney on the red planet To me every night . He was a genius who put his life on hold for me . - None of that 's your fault . - I opened a door to wherever he is , And now he 's in pain . You saw his face . That is my fault ! Me ! I 'm the epic fail . - Claudia , it is making you sick . - I owe him ! And so do you , and we 're running out of time . Damn it , artie ! Help me save Joshua . [ Cell phone ringing ] - [ Sighs ] it 's a pay phone . - What ? - Lattimer . - Pete , how are you ? How you doing ? - Artie ! Artie , hey , man . Are you all right ? - Ask him where he is . - Oh , yeah . No , I 'm--I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I 'm just here with an old friend , that 's all . - Claudia donovan . - Very good . You ready my lips using The durational spectrometer , didn 't you ? - Where is he ? Where--Wait . He probably doesn 't know . - Right , right . Artie , do you hear anything like a freeway , machinery ? - Train whistles . Ask him if he hears any train whistles . - Guys , hey , hey ! Look , uh , the truth is that I 'm helping her , all right ? - You 're helping her ? - He 's helping her ? You 're- - You 're helping her , artie ? - [ Sighs ] I figured that you 'd be halfway towards finding us , But you can stop now . Did you hear me ? You can stop . - No , artie , she 's been under observation At a psychiatric facility , all right ? - Oh , I-I-I had no- - Poor kid . I didn 't know . - No . No , not poor kid . Poor artie . She 's obsessed with you . She 's obsessed with the warehouse , And I 'm not letting you stay with her . What ? You 're not letting me ? That 's really cute , myka . - Cute ? Cute . - She 's cute ? - Does she have a gun on you ? - Okay , look , these kids ' lives were messed up by- - They 're in trouble . I can help . That 's all you need to know . - Well , let us come and help you . - No , no , no , no ! We have everything we need to make this work , And I 'm telling you I 'm fine . - Well , artie , wait , wait , artie , artie- - He hung up . - Seriously , you know ? If mrs . Frederic can call us , we should be able to call her . Is there a star 69 on this thing ? - Star 69 wasn 't invented when that was made . - No , this wasn 't invented when this was made . - Why doesn 't artie want us to help him , pete ? What 's going on ? - Yes , what 's going on indeed . - Man , I really hate that . - I believe I told you to stay put . - No , I-I know . Um , it 's just that we were going to- - - You know , it would be nice if we could contact you . We had a lead . We decided to follow it . - Don 't--Don 't make her angry . - What kind of lead ? - Well , uh , artie is--Is with , uh , Claudia donovan . - Voluntarily . Do you know where they are ? - It 's possible . But we 've got bigger fish . You need to get down to the warehouse floor . Find the san anselmo grid on the larkspur shelf , Number 1021 , Section 40594904 . - Wait , we have a right to know where artie- - - Ms. Bering , your right extends Exactly as far as I say it does . If artie is working with Claudia , He may be trying to re-Create her brother 's experiment . - And that 's bad ? - Where do you work ? - Right . - The rheticus compass . - Yes . His experiments were successful . That 's why he didn 't disappear into thin air . - And Joshua did . - Yes , something went awry . You have to glean how Joshua went wrong 12 years ago . - I still don 't understand why you don 't tell us- - - What ? Tell you where he is ? If you run after artie Governed solely by your affection for him , You won 't be helping him . - I don 't think it 's a bad thing to care about artie . - He needs information , not emotion . You go empty-Handed , The experiment ends up just as it did before . You 're merely two more lost bodies . - Thank you . - So what are we looking for on--On the san anselmo grid ? - I 'm not certain . But every artifact in this warehouse Is an extension of a person . Understand rheticus , understand the compass . And for the record , I care a great deal What happens to artie . - " Glean . " Ms. Fancy . - You 're lucky that I have an emergency travel kit In the trunk of my car . - Well , " serendipity " is my stripper name . - Okay , so without the compass , What I 'm hoping is that some of these Will be able to help us get A much , much stronger electrical charge Than what you were able to get using conventional means . Now , to electrify the feldkirch minerals To a higher frequency ... Ben franklin 's lightning rod . - I thought his thing was a key . - Oh , no , no , no . Everybody fixates on the key . No , no , please . This is much , much better . Trust me . - Well , um , what about- - - Ah ! That 's terrifying . Uh , listen , um , I heard about the psych ward . I had no idea . I 'm sorry . - Yeah , well ... Hey . It 's his journal . Take a look . - Joshua 's ? - Mm-Hmm . - Okay . See , this is- - That 's the rubbing at the edge- " Useless . " " Useless . " " Useless . " " Useless . " I 'm guessing artie thought these things were useless . I mean , they 're all rheticus gadgets , But none of them tripped artie 's trigger . - Okay , so Joshua had to follow all these rules To try and make the compass work , right ? The kid even figured out This complicated differential equation . He was a genius . - Yeah , and the compass still didn 't work . - Well , it half worked . - Ooh . - What is that ? It 's en--It 's engraved with the--The letter " t . " - " T. " Why not an " r " and why " t " ? - I don 't know what it means . Okay , look , artie 's notes said that rheticus ' work Often expressed a need for order . So what did Joshua miss ? I mean , maybe he translated something wrong , or- - - I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know . Maybe . - What are you doing ? - Rules and order , right ? - Right . - Okay , well , after spending the last couple of months With someone who also likes those things- - Uh , you know , crosswords , puzzles . - I like puzzles . So ? - So ... So did rheticus . - A secret panel . - I 'm increasing the power of the electrical field here By about 17 times where you had it , So you might want to stand back . - Yeah , standing isn 't really an option right now . - You all right ? - Oh , super . - What ? - Artie , he 's almost here . - I know . I ... Uh , I-I feel a- - Uh , I feel ... Feels like something familiar . - Listen , I know , I know , I know . It 's all , uh- - It 's all folklore . - I-I know this place . I know this place . - Professor ? I-I have found all of the instructions that I need . I have the equation for the electrical field . I have all of these things . - Nobody believes that rheticus succeeded . I mean , it 's probably just a bedtime story , Joshua . - That 's what you think . - Joshua doesn 't get the concept of being nice to the money guy . - Ah . - Do you want the professor To recommend you for the grant or not ? - See , Claudia here doesn 't get the concept of being ten . - Joshua , please don 't do this . - It 's okay , professor . He may be antisocial , but he 's very smart . He knows what he 's doing . - Does he ? - This . This is his compass . I know I can re-Create what rheticus did . It 's teleportation , professor . - Please don 't . - Hey ... Trust me . - I started having the dreams two years ago . It 's what got me started on all this . It 's because we were both here . - Hang in there , kid ! This should be a good first run ! May be able to slow him down with this one ! - Yeah , got it . Hold--Hold on . - Claudia . - Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia . Claudia . - Man , this guy was nuts for secret panels . - Yeah , and they weren 't mentioned In any of Claudia 's books . - Yeah , and if she didn 't know , It 's a safe bet that artie and Joshua didn 't know . - You see the writing around these edges ? - Yeah , it 's latin . Oh . Let me guess . You speak latin too . - Okay , make one more nerd joke , And I 'm gonna point out how you 're losing your hair . Okay , so the rules , right ? The rules are in latin , And rules teach us how to use the objects . - So Joshua took them off the compass himself . - Yeah , but he was missing something . - Rheticus hid some rules . - And Joshua never saw them . - Nice . - Hmm . - You don 't have it high enough yet , artie . I 'm stuck . - No , Joshua , I-I can help you ! - No , Claudia 's tied to this now . It 's killing her . And you , you 're tied to this now too . - She 's the one I 'm worried about . Joshua , if you come back twice more ... I can hold you here ! I can save you both ! - No , will you look at her ? This place is growing increasingly unstable , And it 's getting worse . Next time I show up here , it 'll kill her , okay ? Listen , you have to cut the tether . All right , overload the electrical field . Just--The conductor you 're using- - - The , uh , lightning rod ? - Yeah . Blow it up . Just use that . - No , that 'll destroy the whole- - It 'll kill you , Joshua ! - I know . You can 't save us both . To save her , you have to kill me . Do it before I 'm pulled back here again . - So there 's something hidden on the compass . - And we think it 's the rule that Joshua missed . - Nicely done . - Right , yeah ? Now check this out . In artie 's notes , it said that Joshua Had everything that he needed for his experiment in his lab . - Where it was locked up for 12 years . - But before artie hung up , He said that he had everything that he needed . Bing , bang , boom . Claudia took artie to the lab . - You took the initiative , And you recognized what needed to be done , All in artie 's absence . I 'm pleased . I know , right ? * score * - Why the test ? Was artie going somewhere ? - Let 's hope not . The directions are in the file . You should get to that lab and quickly . We don 't know how much time we 've got left . - Do you think she 's weird ? I think she 's weird . She always acts weird . Joshua come- - Come and gone already ? - Yeah . - " Craptastic . " - Here . - Well , at least we 're closer to bringing him back . - Okay , you all right ? - Yeah , no , I 'm fine . Listen . - Yeah ? - Thank you . Teleportation is such a powerful weapon , And people want it , Joshua . They 're gonna come get it . - Well , I think I 've finally solved the equation . Listen to me . I could just lay low . - Listen to me . People--The people- - The people that want it , want it now . They 're coming after you right now . There 's no time left , Joshua . What you have to do is you have to ... Protect yourself . Just protect your family . Just give me the compass temporarily . I know exactly where to put it where it 'll be safe . - It 's , um ... It 's in my professor 's office . - Good . - You stay with Claudia till I get back . I 'll just be a minute . Hey , thank you , professor . - Sure . - Hey , what are you doing ? - I made a promise to your brother , And I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you . - What ? - We 're blowing this up . - That 'll kill Joshua . Artie , you have to put that back . You have to have the field ready to catch him . - No , no , no , no , no . That 'll kill you , and I don 't care if you hate me . I 'm not gonna let you die too . - I do hate you . I 'm never gonna forgive you . He 's on his way . - Good . That 's good . - What 's wrong ? - Huh ? Oh , nothing . - Yes , something . What ? - Uh , it 's just your brother . He should be back by now . You know what ? Why don 't we go check on him ? Okay ? Don 't worry . I won 't let anything happen to Joshua , I promise . Claudia , I don 't have much time before it starts again . I 'm sorry ... For everything . But I 've got to save one of you . Showtime . Showtime . - Artie ! - Joshua ! I told you not to do this ! I told you not to follow me . - Okay , well , dock our pay . We came here to save you . - Is that Claudia donovan ? - Yes , yes , she 's- - She 's just unconscious . What ? What ? - Joshua didn 't have all the rules , artie . - Rheticus loved puzzles . - And his designs had secret panels . - It 's inside ? It 's inside the compass . - Yes , in latin . Where is it ? Artie , where is the compass ? - We just have to pop open the panel And find out which rule it is , so where is it ? - I don 't--I don 't- - I don 't have it . - I had to try , artie . I couldn 't give up without trying . Once you said that there was no more time left , I had to prove that I could teleport . - No , no , no , no , no , no , no . - Artie , what are you doing ? - I 'm--I 'm doing what Joshua did . - No , no ! That 's how he died ! - He 's not dead . Claudia ? I think I can save him . I thought what I have to do- - - Don 't do this ! Artie ! - Artie , make him stop ! You promised ! - Claudia , it 's okay . Remember , I will always , always- [ Screams ] Artie , what 's happening ? - It 's not over . Joshua ? Touch my hand . Joshua ! - Uh , okay . Where the hell are we ? - Claudia , artie , you 're here . - Joshua . - Look at you . You- - I can 't believe you 're here . - Yeah , I 'm here . I 'm here . Wait . I 'm here ? You took me to the inter-Dimensional space ? You were supposed to get him out , d-Bag . - No , he was supposed to destroy it . Clearly , he 's insane . - Children , don 't fight , please . I can be both a d-Bag and insane . Just where 's the compass ? - It 's right there . - All right . Rheticus put rules right on objects , Sometimes inside objects . - A hidden panel . Yeah . - Yes , yes , yes . In this case ... It requires a combination , But they didn 't mention a combination . - Wait . Letters or numbers ? - It 's letters , but- - - How many ? - I mean , there 's 20-Something letters . - Artie , try T-H-O-M-A-S . - Why ? - " Thomas . " Rheticus wrote a poem , the loss of reason , About his lost love , somebody named thomas . - Thomas , okay . - [ Scoffs ] how did I miss that ? - Ah , latin . - Oh , crap . - No , no , no , no .

 Would you like a treatment ? Uh , I was just ... sitting because I 'm ... tired . Life of a handler is pretty exhausting . Better you than me . You just off shift ? For a few hours . Can 't really seem to sleep , though . It 's hard to imagine Echo being ... Did you touch this ? I didn 't ... It 's not a toy , Ballard . Leave the tech to the grown-ups , okay ? So , Echo ... it 's good , right ? It 's different . Not the romance , the other protocol . I 'm not gonna lie to you . I kind of blew my own mind this time . One special client request , one minor change to Echo 's bodily functions , and I just opened up a whole new world for us . It 's all still new to me . Yeah , yeah , yeah , but this ... I made code for the brain ... that changed the physical body . And I 'm not talking about muscle memory so somebody can play fancy piano . I made changes on a glandular level . Do you have any idea what this could mean ? Explain it to me . Well , arguably , one could program the brain to ... fight cancer . Or be telekinetic . Or not have that gag reflex when you eat sea urchin . Or whatever . The possibilities are pretty much endless is what I 'm saying . I don 't want to use The word " genius , " but I 'd be okay if you wanted to . So you could do all that to me with this chair ? Not you . To an active . I can 't fiddle with a mind until it 's wiped clean . The human mind is like Van Halen . If you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it , it just degenerates . Yeah . I don 't understand . But it 's so cute that you 're trying . Mm ! Okay . Good talk ! Huh ? ! Yeah ! Say hi to Echo for me . Tell her we 're all very proud . I thought I heard you . Shh , don 't wake daddy . There , you ... Dollhouse s2e02 Instinct Timing Anuris Okay , little man . Mommy needs to mainline some caffeine . So you just chill there for one sec . Babe , you want coffee ? Nate , you in there ? Whoa ! Good morning . You 're up early . Everything all right ? Um , yeah , it 's fine . I 'm good . Okay . I said good morning . Jack and I were gonna go to the park today and feed the duckies . That sounds fun . You guys should do that . You could play hooky and join us . Yeah , um , I don 't think so . Um , could you grab him while I finish the coffee ? Uh , I don 't , um ... Yeah . Here , you 're not gonna break him . He 's not gonna bite you or spontaneously combust . You 've got a master 's degree in finance , babe . This should be a piece of cake . Okay , I 'm sorry . I don 't , uh ... You know ... I 'm , I 'm gonna be late for work . Nate , wait . Will you be home for dinner ? Nah , I 've got that , uh , that prentiss thing . You shouldn 't wait up . Bye . Then he was supposed to take Jack for a play date with the neighbors , and at the last minute , he 's got another meeting as usual . Nate 's a workaholic , em . He 's always been that way . It 's more than that . It 's like I hand him the baby , and he acts like I 've handed him a live grenade . Well , men are all wusses . He 's the one who pushed having kids right away . I wanted to wait a couple of years . Well , tell him he has help out . You can 't raise this baby alone . Oh , he helps . Changes the diapers , shops , does the laundry . He 's even read all the books . Okay , now I just wanna swap . I can 't believe how much I love this little boy . And I don 't even know if Nate likes him . Or me , for that matter . Nate 's crazy about you . I think he 's having an affair . Em , when was the last time you had a full night 's sleep ? I ... I don 't even remember . You 're exhausted . Your hormones are all over the place . This isn 't hormones . He 's never home . He works all day , and almost every night he 's got dinner or drinks . And then when he is home , he 's always taking phone calls outside So I don 't hear what he 's saying . That doesn 't mean affair . Then maybe he 's doing something illegal . What ? Why would you think that ? I 've noticed this black van parked outside the house every day . I think we 're being watched . No one is watching you , Emily . You 're sleep-deprived , and it 's making you a little nuts . Look , some guys take a little longer to get used to the idea of being a dad . But it gets better . You sure ? I 'm positive . Besides , Nate isn 't the type to sleep around . What you need is a night of uninterrupted sleep . Make Nate take the baby tonight . Have a glass of wine , put some earplugs in , and give yourself a break . Things will work out , I promise . I 'm so lucky to have you in my life , Kelly . I 'd go completely crazy without you . That 's what I 'm here for . And you 're right . I 'm not obsessing about this anymore . I 'm just gonna give nate his space , and let him figure it out himself . We 're just going to find out what daddy 's up to , aren 't we , baby boy ? Yes , we are ! And if he 's got nothing to hide , he won 't mind if I go through all his stuff , will he , baby boy ? No . He won 't . Hello ? Anybody home ? Emily ? Are you here ? Geez . You ... Who is she ? Where 's jack ? He 's asleep in his room , and you still haven 't answered my question . Who the hell is she , Nate ? How did you , um ... ? You 're not supposed to ... I knew it . I knew you were having an affair . You went into my office . That 's private . That 's my private stuff . Private ? This is where you and I went on our honeymoon . Tell me who she is ! I knew her before I knew you . I was in love with her . Son of a bitch . But then she died . And it was very painful ... for me . And it took a long time for me to get over it . In some ways , I 'll never be over it . But I shouldn 't have kept that from you . That was wrong . I 'm sorry . You should have told me . I know . You 're right . It was a mistake . This is all a terrible mistake . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have gone completely mental on you . I should have just talked to you like a normal person . I 've just been so tired ... Why don 't you go to bed . Right now . I 'll take jack tonight . That 's the least I can do . We 'll talk tomorrow , okay ? Okay . Thank you . Things will be better in the morning . This is a disaster . Now you people promised me something that you cannot deliver . This is not working . I am calling it off . Get rid of her . I 'll get rid of the baby . I think I might have made a mistake . You think I jumped the gun ? Which gun ? The press conference . I was hoping when we went public , witnesses would come forward . What about the man with the tinfoil hat ? Didn 't he say rossum mailed his liver to Saturn ? Right now , he 's our star . We have anecdotal evidence that rossum and the other big meds are performing illegal medical procedures and unlicensed experiments . But that 's all it is - anecdotal . You have a source at the NSA ? Had . Like everyone else , he 's gone to ground . Well , you have their financials . That 's a lot of unaccounted cash transactions for medical research . It wouldn 't be hard to prove money laundering . This is nice . Hmm . Focus . You 're foil-hat man 's only hope . Mmm . Sit . I got it . I 'm not after money laundering . Rossum crossed a line . And they 've got to be leaning on people to keep them quiet . They 've got the resources . Cindy ? There was nobody there . Good morning , Madeline . May I come in ? Place looks lovely . I stripped a lot of it back to the original . Work is good ? You know , I haven 't worked a day since I 've been home . God bless you , my dear . I should feel guilty About that . I really , really don 't . Absolutely not . Do you know how many people would kill to have this kind of freedom ? It 's strange . I never thought I 'd be among the idle rich . You should travel . You 're allowed to leave the country , you know . I don 't think so . I 've been away so long , part of me just wants to stay close to home . Is there a young man keeping you close to home ? Maybe . I 'm not sure . I thought as much . Do tell . Adelle ... Don 't misunderstand . It 's nice to see you . But I have this irrational fear that if I say one wrong thing , men in suits are going to throw me in a black van and take me away . Not at all . Your obligation to the Dollhouse is complete . Right . So you 're just here for a friendly chat ? You haven 't come in for your diagnostic . Just because you leave our care , we don 't cast you to the wolves , Madeline . I 'm worried about you . I appreciate that . I suspect you 're also worried that I 'll flip out and expose you and the Dollhouse ? Well ... The two worries aren 't mutually exclusive . You know what I 'm wondering ? Is if this is really about the fact that you let me out of my contract early . Years early . Why is that ? Did something happen ? Circumstances changed . I 'm not at liberty to discuss them . For your own well-being , come and have your diagnostic . I won 't take no for an answer . No . I don 't imagine you will . Hey , where are two going ? Um , just for a walk . A walk outside . We 'll be right back . Yeah ? Y ... you 're holding your car keys . Um ... We 're going to the park in the car , and then for a walk . Oh . You know , I , uh ... I thought that we could all eat breakfast together . I just discovered that I can actually cook something called scrambled eggs , and I don 't want to brag , but they 're pretty amazing . You know , that sounds so great , but I 'm not hungry . Aren 't you supposed to be at work ? I took the day off . That 's ... great , baby . Yeah , it 's long overdue . Oh , um , I forgot . You ... you can 't drive anywhere today . Why not ? Well , I took Your car into the shop to get the brake pads replaced , and I forgot the baby seat inside . I 'm sorry . It 'll probably be ready tomorrow . You didn 't need to do that , Nate . I know . I 'm just Trying to help out . You know what ? Why don 't you go back to bed , and I 'll take this little guy ? Wait . No , no . No , no , no . It 's okay . Go on . We 're gonna have a little man time down here . It 's time for him to eat . I forgot , but I should feed him . Yeah . All right . Mm . Just why don 't you take a nap when you 're done ? Promise . Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . Okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Okay . Hello ? Kelly , you have to come get me and the baby . What 's wrong ? Nate won 't let us leave . I think he 's trying to kill me . Emily , he took away the car ! That 's crazy . Just please come and get us ! I 'll explain everything . All right . All right , I 'm on my way . Thank you . Shh . It 's okay . Oh . Thank God . No . Oh . Oh , God . Oh , God . She 's upstairs . Husband says she 's been acting a little paranoid , and she has the kid with her , so let her see me first . We don 't want this to get out of hand . Shh . Oh , oh . Mrs. Jordan , would you like a treatment ? What the hell ? You got to be kidding me . It 's okay , baby boy . We 're going to be okay . Please , sit down , Mr. Juror . I will not sit down . Your zombie took my Jack , and you are sitting there drinking tea . Do something ! Echo will not harm your child . She loves him . She is his mother . I 'm sorry ? Are you listening to yourself ? She is not his mother . But she is , Mr. Jordan . This isn 't someone playing make-believe . In Echo 's mind , she planned for this child . Carried him for nine months . Delivered him and nursed him . For all intents and purposes , Jack is her baby . I gave you people money ... a lot of money ... and you send a crazy kidnapping chick into my house . What the hell did I pay you for ? A mother . You could have hired a nanny , a baby-sitter , but you wanted someone to bond profoundly with your child because you could not bond with him yourself , which is understandable . I shouldn 't have done this . This-this was a terrible idea . The formative months of an infant 's life are crucial . A child who feels loved is imprinted with the sense that the world is a safe place . A child that does not feel loved grows up to be ... Well ... most likely a sociopath . What happens to a child kidnapped by a stranger ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Jordan , but your next plan was to put up the child for adoption , was it not ? Just find him . We know exactly where Echo and the baby are . And we are retrieving them as we speak . We 're just hitting the bank . Taking out as much of daddy 's money as they will let us . And then you and I are road-tripping it , sweetheart . Won 't that be fun ? Officers ! Officers ! Please help me . Someone is chasing me . They 're trying to take away my baby . Where ? Damn it . They were right there , I swear . You have to believe me . My husband 's trying to have me killed . You 're safe now . Come with us . I know it sounds crazy . I listen to myself and I sound crazy . But I heard him . My husband wants to take my baby and get me killed . It doesn 't make any sense . I don 't know what I did . The important thing is , you came to us . Too many women convince themselves they 're overreacting or pretend things will get better . Then it 's too late . You have to understand . He 's not an abuser . He 's never laid a hand on me . He doesn 't even raise his voice . I 'm not a victim . Yeah , not yet . Let 's try to keep it that way . You had a baby . Some guys can 't handle the stress . They snap . He didn 't snap . He just ... Went away , you know ? It 's like the person I knew isn 't there anymore . It 's like he 's been replaced by a stranger and ... I don 't even know what I 'm saying . Yes , you do . And you 're lucky you got out when you did . What 's going to happen now ? We 'll formally record your statement , then we 'll bring your husband in for questioning . In the meantime , we 'll get a judge to grant you a restraining order . That 's him . Oh , god . That 's him . And that 's one of the men that came into my house . Talking to my captain . Don 't worry . You 're safe . Stay put . I 'll see what 's going down . You can 't hurt me in here , Nate . Whatever you 've got planned , it 's not going to work . You sure about this , Mr. Jordan ? I am positive . That is my baby , but that is not my wife . No one 's going to hurt you , Emily . This man is from the FBI . He just wants to talk to you , okay ? Stay away from me . Stay away from me ! I promise , you will be safe . Don 't come any closer ! No ! No ! No , don 't take my baby ! No , don 't take my baby ! Don 't ! Don 't ! No ! Come on ! Jack ! Jack ! It 's okay . I don 't want to hurt you . No , no . Just don 't fight . Jack ! It 's okay . I 'm not going to hurt you ! Don 't ! Don 't take him ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go , please ! Don 't take him , Jack ! Don 't take him ! Jack ! Jack ! 72 , 65 , 58 , 51 ... Thank you . Repeat these words . " Boat . Cucumber . Wire . " Boat . Cucumber . Wire . Very good . Any headaches , dizziness ? None . Nightmares , deja vu ? No . Gag reflex while eating sea urchin ? What ? Forget it . So , uh , I 'm not broken ? You 're not glitching . And I haven 't found any phantom files or random memory threads . Physiologically , you 're intact . So , I 'm finished , then . What were those three words I asked you to repeat ? Boat . Cucumber . Wire . Clean bill of health . Factory new and not a scratch on you . As promised . We should put you in the recruiting dvd . Thank you very much . So , uh , how do I get out of here ? Uh , I 'll let them know that you 're ready to be taken home . Hey , um ... While we 're waiting , may I offer you any additional enhancements ? On the house . I 've been working on some pretty sick apps . How do you feel about ventriloquism ? So tempting . Uh , I 'll have to pass . Well , it 's a dying art . No ! Let go of me ! Give me back my son ! Give me back my son ! Little help ? Get her in the chair . Get her in the chair . They stole my baby . Help me ! Did you offer her a treatment ? Gee , that 's a great idea , Topher . Why won 't anybody help me ? No ! No , no , no ! No ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! No ! Let me go ! No ! No ! You knocked her out ? No . I can 't wipe her when she 's knocked out . Think . Okay , just come on . Put her in the chair . I 'll wipe her when she wakes up . Whenever that is . What are you doing here ? Just came in for a diagnostic . Wow . That was really intense . You 're bleeding . I remember you . You do ? My last day here , when I was signing the paperwork ... Oh . Right . Come on . Let 's get that taken care of . Looks good . Don 't even need a stitch . Thanks . You okay ? I don 't know . To be clear , nobody took anybody 's baby . She 's an active , like you used to be . It was all pretend . Is it always like that ? Like what ? She really believed someone took her child . Heart and soul . Like I said , it wasn 't real . But it was , for her . All that emotion , all that pain . Was I ever like that ? We 're not good for each other . Stop being so cruel ! Can 't you see this is killing me ? You 'll get over it . You know , I 'm kind of new here . I wouldn 't really know . She 'll be okay . Who ? The girl . You seemed worried for her . She 'll forget about the baby . She 'll forget everything . No more pain . No more grief . That 's how it works . They did it for me . I had a daughter . She died . I 'm sorry . She had a cold . And then it wasn 't a cold . It was cancer . Terminal . And my world fell apart . Within six months , she was gone , and I was left all alone , completely unable to function . I had no idea . How could you ? But what I 'm telling you is , it all worked out . I met Adelle . She came to you ? She told me I didn 't have to suffer anymore . I go to sleep for five years , I wake up without pain . So , what , you ... You 're happy now ? I 'm not sad . It was nice meeting you . You seem like a nice man . Please help me . They 're going to do something terrible to my little boy . I am a nice man . You 're going to be just fine . I promise . I 'm going to make all this go away . So , you 'll help me ? Absolutely . No ! No ! I get rid of her child . Hello , Echo . How are you feeling ? Did I fall asleep ? For a little while . Shall I go now ? - God ! - What is it ? Wiretap transcripts . This is more than just medical malfeasance or ethics violations . This is ... prostitution . Human trafficking . Maybe murder . They take people , and they ... change them into whatever they want them be . That 's not possible . It 's very possible . I read everything about this . When Mom was sick , Rossum had the means to help her , and instead , they ... Okay . You know , when we first started looking into this , I thought this was a game - changer for us , a trophy , the next step up in your career . I 'm scared , Daniel . Oh , darling . The power that these people have ... Do you want me to back off ? No . No , I want you to do what you promised . This has to stop . We 're gonna verify all this . We 're gonna find proof . We 've got better than proof . We 've got a name . Go , please ? What , precisely , was the last thing she said to you ? I 'm telling you , I remember wiping her , and then my face exploded . That 's it . Where 's she going ? GPS has her heading to ... Nate Jordan 's house ... she 's going after the baby . How can that be ? You were supposed to have wiped her . I did ! I 'm sure of it . Are we looking at another composite event , Mr. Brink ? I don 't think so . I think we 're looking at a genius . I 'm not as comfy with you saying that as I thought I 'd be . Think about it - you changed her on a glandular level . Maybe her body was stronger than her brain . Yeah ! Yeah . Yeah . The maternal instinct is the purest . It 's too strong for a normal wipe . I outplayed myself . Like in chess . Not like chess ... like Echo was in trouble and pain because you didn 't think it through . She probably can 't even remember his name , but she has to have him back , no matter what . Perhaps triggering lactation was a bridge too far . Live and learn . Go . Now . Hi . Well , I guess that 's gonna hold . What do you think ? Huh ? You had a crazy day , huh , buddy ? But things are gonna be okay . You and me ... we 're gonna figure it out . Whoa ! Come here , pal . Okay ? All right . All right . I 'm going to see about getting a bottle together for you . Okay ? Now , don 't you go anywhere . Don 't you go anywhere . All right . Daddy 'll be right back . Whew ! Smells like fish . Aw , damn it ! Hold on , buddy ! I 'll be right there . Hello ? Mr. Jordan , Adelle DeWitt . It is imperative you and your son leave your house at once . What ? Why ? There 's little time for discussion . Our Active is on her way to you . I 've dispatched a team to intercept . Get out of the house immediately , Mr. Jordan . She 's coming here ? Why ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? ! Jack ? ! No ! No ! Jack ? Jack ? Jack ? ! Jack ! Where are you ? Mommy 's home . Please . Don 't hurt him . You took away my baby . - Why did you do that ? - I 'm sorry . Can ... can I please have him back ? I love him . I don 't want to give him to you . I 'm his daddy . But this is my baby . I know that you think that he is . I want you to go away now . I can 't do that . Babies need their mothers . I know . But you aren 't his mother . That 's a lie ! I don 't want to talk to you anymore ! I know that you love Jack very much ... but he doesn 't belong to you . And I am afraid that you 're going to hurt him . That 's not me . That 's not right . Okay . Do you remember ? They turned you into somebody else . Y - You 're not real . None of this is real . I 'm not real . Do you know who is real ? No . I don 't . And I 'm sorry . This is my fault . I put you through hell . They made you love Jack because I asked them to . Why did you do that ? My wife , Karen ... she died while having Jack . And I couldn 't handle it , and I fell apart , and I blamed him . I ... I blamed a baby . Do you believe that ? And after she died , I needed to find someone who would love Jack because I couldn 't do it myself . So , can I be his mommy ? No . I 'm sorry . You can 't . Karen is a part of Jack . You aren 't . And he 's all that I have of her anymore . So ... you ... you ... you can do whatever you want to do to me . Just p ... just please don 't hurt the baby . My little boy . It 's okay . Are you okay ? I had a baby . Now I don 't have him anymore . I feel sad . I 'm sorry . All of these things that happen to me ... I feel them . I know , Echo . I know you remember everything . Not remember . Feel . I was married . I felt love . And pain , fear . It 's not pretend for me . They made me love my little boy . And then they took him away . They make it so real . Every time , they make it so real . Why do they do that ? I know you want to help me bring down the Dollhouse , but maybe it 's too much . I can do this on my own . I promise I 'll get you out . I 'll get all of you out . If you want , I 'll tell Topher what 's going on with you , and he can fix it . He 'll come up with a way to wipe you , and you won 't remember a thing . You won 't have to feel sad anymore . Feeling nothing would be worse . That would be like before . Asleep . I 'm awake now . I don 't want to back to sleep .

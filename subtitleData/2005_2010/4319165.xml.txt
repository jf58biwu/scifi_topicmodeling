 Previously on V : It 's a day of high emotion as we open our doors ... to a nation from beyond our imaginations . The captains of all 29 ships are present . The Visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . There 's others out there like me who will help . There were hundreds of images being captured by the damn jackets . Why don 't they just annihilate us ? They need us for something . We want to provide complete medical services to all . John May started the Fifth Column . The first group of Visitors to ever turn against the leadership . The Fifth Column says hello . Georgie , this is Erica . I brought a friend . Hello . - Hello . Tyler 's the one . We should use him . - You 're doing an excellent job . - Thank you , Mother . Georgie . I feel like I 've been doing a lot of the talking . Sorry about that . Oh , it 's okay . We 're grateful . You know so much more about the V 's than we do . Been doing this a long time . They came after me when I first found out about them . I got away . My family didn 't . Jack told me . I 'm sorry . How do you know so much about them ? Been doing this even longer than Georgie . Look , we all know why we 're here . We need to hit them back for what they did to us at the warehouse . We don 't have enough people to hit anyone back . We don 't need a lot of people . We just need to get our hands on a V. Then what ? Then we cut it open and we show the world what 's underneath . We do that , they 'd have no choice but to retaliate . And that 's just a war we can 't win . They 'd wipe us out . Georgie , no one 's backing down . But we have to be smart about how we fight . You didn 't answer my question before . How do you know so much about the V 's ? You got nothing to worry about with Ryan . He saved my ass at the warehouse . If it wasn 't for him , I 'd be dead right now . Why ? Why didn 't you just tell them that you 're a V ? A priest and an FBI agent . What , you can 't trust them ? What 's wrong with you ? I better not ever hear you talk about skinning a V again . His name is Dale Maddox . A sleeper agent we had installed in the New York FBI office . And you 're telling me he was murdered aboard my ship ? Yes . In the medical bay . We 've never had a murder on any of our ships . Who would do such a thing ? There are rumors of traitors aboard . Fifth Column . We can 't afford any kind of dissonance among our people . Joshua , assemble a team immediately and find out who did this . Good morning , sweetheart . - You working ? - Mm-hm . Can I talk to you for a minute ? Absolutely . Can you give me two minutes ? Then the Visitor 's High Commander , Anna . I understand you have some exciting news to share . We do , Chad . We 're announcing a new program that will spread the miracles of our Healing Centers to countless people . Do you know when she 'll be back ? Was there another doctor I can see ? Forward-thinking doctors we 've spoken to ... It 's all right . Yeah , thanks , anyway . You all right ? I feel like crap . There 's that nasty bug that 's going around . No , it 's these meds . They 're making me so tired . I 'm trying to get them changed , but Dr. Soder 's out of town till next week . - Maybe I should stop taking them . - No . You can 't stop taking heart medication . I know . I 'll be fine . I 've just got a couple of clients today . So I 'm gonna take it easy . Okay . - Lf you need anything , let me know , okay ? - I will . - Love you . - I love you . Which brings me to today 's announcement . Our physicians are able to treat a number of human ailments but preventative medicine is also important . We 've developed an injection , call it a vitamin supplement designed to strengthen the immune system . And not just strengthen it , I 'm told , but supercharge it to help fight off numerous forms of cancer other diseases , even stave off the effects of aging . All true . We 'll be offering the injections round the clock at our Healing Centers in the days to come . Any chance you 're gonna cure the common cold for us ? Your flu shots will have to suffice . I 'm afraid even we haven 't cracked the common cold . I guess even the V 's have their limitations . Anna , thank you so much for being with us today . Mom , it 's been like way more than two minutes . Yeah . Uh ... Yes . I 'm sorry . - Hi . - Hi . I 'm all yours . - Okay . - Okay . It 's about the girl you met last night , Lisa . " Half-naked-girl-in-my-son 's-room " Lisa . - Mom . - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Do you ... ? Okay . Okay . I 'm not gonna get it . I wanna hear . I 'm not gonna get it . If it 's work , you should take it . It 's fine . Will you hold on for a second , because I will get rid of him , okay ? - Evans . - Yeah , it 's Ryan . Yeah , I 'm gonna need to call you back . No . This can 't wait . - Ty . Bubba . - No , Mom , seriously , it 's fine . No , I can ... I would ... - Well , we 'll talk about it later . - We could ... - Yeah . - We need to meet . Right now . This thing that Anna 's calling a vitamin injection , she 's lying . How do you know ? A couple years ago , I took out a cell of V scientists . They were working on an injection . Tried to mass produce and distribute it among humans . If you 'd put something harmful into a vitamin ... why go on television ? Make a big deal about it ? Anna wouldn 't make an announcement like this if it wasn 't something big . I know what I 'm talking about . They 've reactivated this plan . So they 're gonna take us out one shot at a time ? No , this is part of something that 's just much bigger . I know the names of the V 's involved last time . Some of them survived . Maybe you can run them through the FBI ... see who 's still out there . This isn 't getting us anywhere . - Is that all of them ? - Yeah . No . Try Peter Combs . He was a lab assistant . Pretty low level . That 's him . Professor of Chemistry . Not low level anymore . - This Peter Combs , he 's a V ? - He 's a V. Track him down and find out what he 's up to . How about we take him out ? Taking out one V 's not gonna get us anywhere . If we follow , he 'll lead us to a part of the puzzle . Seriously ? That 's the plan , follow him ? That 's the plan . I can 't talk to my mom anymore . I tried telling her about this girl I met ... she won 't give me two seconds . She doesn 't trust me . She keeps on telling me , " Stay away from the V 's . " And you don 't know how to tell her that the V 's are important to you ? She doesn 't want to hear it . I joined the Peace Ambassadors . If my mom knew , she 'd go ballistic . She thinks the V 's are evil . And how do you see them ? The world 's broken . They 're fixing it , and all we do is we get in their way . They got these Healing Centers . The things they can do . Have you been down there to the Healing Centers ? No . Not yet . - Why ? - I just ... I 've been tempted myself to check them out . I hear you have to wait months , though . Well , I mean , if you really want to go , I might be able to help . I kind of know someone . That 's really sweet of you , Tyler . I might actually take you up on that . I hear they 're curing blindness , helping handicapped people walk . All these great things ... and my mom will never know because she won 't even talk to one . You know , I shouldn 't even care . I 'm gonna 18 in a month . Then after that , I won 't have to deal with any of this . Your mom doesn 't stop being your mom because you 're 18 . Yeah . I felt like she stopped being my mom a long time ago . I thought it might take longer ... but I think Tyler 's ready . Good . Bring him up to the ship . Tell him I want to meet him . Relax and restore ... Thank you again for doing this report on our Healing Centers . It 's not like I had much of a choice . Anna wouldn 't do the interview with me unless I did this . Wow . That was amazing . And that 's why we want you to share our story with the world . Hey , this is Tyler . You know what to do . Still can 't get ahold of him ? - He 's mad at me . - Ah . You wanna talk about it ? I do not . Okay . Hello . Hey , it 's Ryan . We 're set . Class is out in 15 minutes . When Combs heads to his car , we got him covered . I 'm on the ground floor . Georgie 's upstairs . I 'll check in with Georgie now . You 've interviewed all of the medical staff ? Extensively . We couldn 't find anyone who could shed any light on the murder . How many of your staff were on duty that day ? Fourteen , maybe 15 . Gather them . They 've already been questioned . I understand that . Gather them anyway . - Get off the ship . - I 'm not running . - You 're important . The Column needs you . - You 'll carry on . No , you cannot be sacrificed , no matter what . I won 't let it happen . Hey , Combs . I 'm gonna cut you open and show the world what you are . Get the car . Georgie . Need to put pressure on that wound . What the hell happened ? He just started shooting at me . Get him some help . I 'm gonna take care of Combs . - What happened ? I don 't know yet . Thought you could get away this time , didn 't you ? - You got him ? - I got him . Okay . I 'll take care of Georgie , just be safe . You too . You thought you were gonna get away this time . You can 't stop us , filthy traitor . No . No . You 're a Visitor . What the hell is going on ? Erica , you and I want the same thing . We both want to know what Combs was doing . Except now I got nothing . You shot him . He was gonna kill you . We 're on the same side , Erica . Everything I 've told you is true . Except that you 're a Visitor . I never said I wasn 't . Sirens are getting close . What 's it gonna be ? Okay . They 'll see you over there . Thank you . Hi . A friend of mine called and made an appointment for me . The diagnostic scan provides an image ... of every system in your body on a cellular scale . A level of detail our medical technology can 't even begin to fathom . Okay . I 'm all set . Now , for anyone who 's had an MRI or a CAT scan ... this scan is ... well , I gotta say , it 's kind of pleasant . Okay , cut . Check that back for me , will you ? Thank you . Getting everything you need , Mr. Decker ? Yeah . Yes . Could use a little more freedom to walk around ... talk to some of the patients , you know , alone . I understand . Tight schedule , I 'm afraid . Maybe next time . How does a priest know his way around a bullet wound ? Army chaplain . Two tours in Iraq . You and the blond are full of surprises . You went after that V in the garage ? I did what was right if we want to win this thing . Well , you 're lucky . The bullet went through . Yeah , I feel lucky . All right . This is gonna hurt . You know , you 're gonna need to decide what you are . A priest or a soldier . Okay . Look . We 're not gonna get anywhere until you get your questions out . - So go . - What happened to Combs ? Suicide pill . Leaves no real evidence behind , nothing but ash . All V 's carry one . Next . He called you a traitor . Are there other V 's like you fighting against Anna ? They 're called the Fifth Column . Good to know . Good . This just looks like paperwork . Wait a minute . He would get all of his supplies from his department , right ? - Probably . - So , what 's his connection ... to the Lyndhurst Shipping Company ? Let 's go check it out . The murdered sleeper agent was a valuable asset . Had he been debriefed , he would have provided us with invaluable information . Someone prevented that from happening . Would you please join the rest . You are a part of the medical staff , aren 't you ? Unless the guilty party steps forward to take responsibility ... I 'm gonna need to choose one of you ... to set an example . The innocent will suffer . Last chance . Long live the Fifth Column . Joshua . As lead medical officer , you will carry out the sentence . Skin him . Am I in trouble with your mom ? Why would you be in trouble ? I don 't know . When you called and said she wanted to meet me ... if it was my mom , I 'd be in trouble . Mine 's not like that . You guys are so much more evolved than we are . Oh , my God . That 's Anna . Do you know her ? Yeah . That 's my mom . Come on . Lisa 's told me all about you . She didn 't tell me a lot about you . But I already knew a lot about you . I 'd like to take some time to get to know Tyler . Is that all right with you ? Sure . Don 't worry , she doesn 't bite . See you later . Excuse me . Can I talk to you for a second ? Thank you . I 'm so lost . I was looking for 5700 Gibbs and I ... No , that address is that way ... Erica . - How 's Georgie ? - He 'll be fine . What are you doing ? Protocol 9 , tells everybody in the building to evacuate immediately . They 'll meet at a rally point off site until further notice . Should buy us some time while we 're in there . There you go . All right . Let 's move . Lisa 's happiness has always been the highest priority for me . And right now , you seem to be a big part of her life . She 's quite taken with you . Me too . I mean , you know , with her . Good . I 'm glad . I wanted to make sure you felt the same . I think it 's a universal instinct for mothers to be protective of their young . Lisa mentioned you liked motorcycles . Yeah , I 'm kind of hooked on machines . Well , I think you 'll enjoy this . This is the propulsion system we use on each of our 29 ships . This is the engine room . You gotta be kidding me . No human has ever seen this before . You were the first , Tyler . I thought you 'd like it . How could you do this ? How could you sacrifice yourself ? You had to be protected . You 're one of Anna 's closest advisers . That makes you the best hope for the Column . I can 't move my body . I gave you something . - I can 't do this . - She suspects you . That 's why she 's making you do it . You have to . Joshua , do it . My death will be meaningless if you 're found out . Erica . You gotta see this . - R6 . - What the hell is R6 ? It 's what they 're putting in that vitamin shot . They 're experimenting on people . Is that the vitamin shot ? No . It 's the flu vaccine . What ? Human vaccine ? They 're not mixing their drug into the vitamin shot . They 're mixing it into our flu vaccine . The shipment leaves tomorrow . They did everything from here . Tested it on humans , packaged it to look like the flu shot . When this mingles with the real shots , no one will be able to tell the difference . No government agency 's gonna be worrying about a flu vaccine ... when they got a V vitamin to evaluate . Which , in all likelihood , is nothing more than a vitamin shot . They know exactly how to play us . The media bombards us with stories ... of epidemics , pandemics . And so we run out . We get a shot to protect ourselves . That 's what the V 's are counting on ... our predictability , our human nature . It 's very calculated , isn 't it ? Everything that Anna does is calculated , yeah . So we stop doing what makes us human ? All I 'm saying is the more predictable we are ... the more vulnerable we are . I 'm gonna keep this as evidence . The rest , we destroy . The diagnostic scan detected your heart condition ... and it is a condition we can heal . Oh , my God , that 's wonderful . I was looking for a change in meds . But the thing is , Ms. Stevens , the diagnostic also turned up something else . Something else ? - They came back . - They figured it out , know we 're here . - You guys go . - Where are you going ? Every V security system has a fail-safe . Erica , come on . They 're coming . Let 's go . Mr. Decker . Yes . May we have a word before you go ? Okay . I 'm sorry , I just wanna make sure I heard you right . You think I 'm gonna die ? Had you not come here , almost certainly . In approximately six months , you will develop a basilar artery aneurysm . But we can heal you , prevent it from developing . You wouldn 't be offended if I got a second opinion , would you ? Your technology won 't be able to detect this until it 's too late . I know this kind of news is difficult , Mr. Decker . But the science is incredibly accurate . Would you like a printout of your medical history to take with you ? - I didn 't give you my medical history . - We analyze in four dimensions . The fourth being time . We can determine what 's going to happen , as well as what 's already happened . Any trauma your body 's sustained over the years ... there 's a biological marker of it stored in every cell . We just extrapolate the data . Chickenpox at age 8 . Bronchitis at 14 . A broken femur , 26 . Appendicitis at 31 . And migraines your whole life . As I said , Chad , incredibly accurate . But the good news is , we can heal you . The bad news is , there is a long waiting list . Though , I suppose , if you 're open to it ... we could work something out . It may not be more than a hiccup to Anna ... but tonight , we landed a punch . Yeah , we did . Speaking of punches , Father , you got a hell of a right hook . That V didn 't see it coming . You guys gonna be okay getting home ? - Yeah , we 'll manage . - Yeah . You made a difference tonight . Our plan is beginning to take hold . Lisa was right . Tyler is the one . What is it ? The warehouse containing all of the R6 compound has been lost . - How ? - In an explosion . It 's all been destroyed . It was sabotage . We received a message from the warehouse moments before . Word has spread quickly . Every ship has heard . There was already a growing concern . But now , there is real fear . Then we 'll have to manage their fear . Remind everyone that even amid talk of the Fifth Column ... of John May ... they have me . No need for regrets for mistakes made yesterday . The past is gone . No looming fate , no uncontrollable destiny . No hunger , no sickness , no fear ... no death . Nothing ahead . Nothing behind . Just stillness light , warmth . The pain you felt , the pain you may have caused others it 's behind you . No looking back . No fear of what will come . Just the pulse of time invigorating , soothing . Bask in my light , take comfort knowing I am here . You will never be alone . What was that ? A gift from my mother . We call it bliss . Hey , sweetheart . I 'm home . I 'm in here . You all right ? How you feeling ? Okay . I got some news today . What 's wrong ? I didn 't believe it , so I had to confirm it . I wasn 't tired because of my meds . I 'm pregnant . We 're gonna have a baby . Pretty soon you 're gonna need to decide what you are a priest or a soldier . Father Travis ? Father Travis . Who are you ? How did you get in here ? The door was open . I need to talk . Look , I 'm sorry , it 's late . You 're gonna have to leave . I 'm desperate . Look , I 'm here tomorrow . We can talk tomorrow . What is it that you need ? Are you ... ? Jack ? Jack ? Tyler ? Ty . Ty . " Invited to the V ship . " Is everything okay , Tyler ? Everything 's fine . Beautiful , isn 't it ? It must be awesome seeing space from one of these ships . Maybe one day you will . What you 've seen today , Tyler ... is only the beginning .

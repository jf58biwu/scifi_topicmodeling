Well , then I 'll show them . You can 't do that . Listen , I 've been there . I understand . I-i wanted to tell the world . I even called a press conference . What happened ? I got shot . I died . And then I saw god . And I truly believe with all my heart That he 's got a higher purpose for us . You think god gave us these powers ? If he didn 't , who did ? A doctor in reseda , california . This is the last number the company has for them . It 's the same area code , so they can 't have gone far . Thanks , claire . For everything . Hi , baby . It 's me . Wait , don 't hang up .

Everything they did to us . It wasn 't god . We were trying to be better than god . How ? By using people as ... Lab rats ? Your own son . Your father was disappointed That you weren 't born with the genetic code . But we thought because of your lineage , Your system could handle it . And obviously we were right . Then what about me ? My parents were dead . I had no one to protect me . Tracy , what this company did to you In the name of science was wrong . We know that now . And that is why we divided the formula And hid it so this would never happen again . An innocent man is dead because of what you did to me . Then help me . Because someone has stolen the formula . They want to restart this project . They want to create a world filled with dangerous people . Deadly , out of control . They will destroy everything . Please help me stop them . Go to hell .

 You 're looking for someone . I think I can help . You want to build yourself a nuclear bomb , a deadly virus , it 's there on the net . Maybe he 's part of a team . They were trying to establish whether terrorists could build a smallpox virus using the Internet . You let him walk away scot-free . That 's aiding and abetting . - Some people might even say treason . - You threatening me ? Heard my conversation . - Where is he ? - They 're still working on him . What happened ? They were attacked by some bear they were studying . All I 've read about Dr. Turnbull will be worth the trip . We 've been studying ways to repair optic nerve damage . Am I a candidate ? You 'll have to decide whether you 're willing to risk total blindness . - Molly . - Hey , Uncle Wes . Hey , kid . Your niece is pregnant . - She 's 12 . - I know . Molly , how 's your dad doing these days ? He 's been good . Has he ... Has he been around a lot ? - Do you have a boyfriend , Molly ? - No . Dad 's real strict . Is it really bad ? How come you haven 't said anything ? You 're pregnant . I 'm serious . - That 's not funny . - I know it 's not funny . But the doctor says you 're pregnant . I can 't be pregnant . I 've never even had sex . Can you think back about eleven weeks ? End of July , beginning of August . I was at summer camp . Did someone ... Do you know what the word " molested " means ? You mean , like , was I raped ? - No , Uncle Wes . - Because the thing is that , there needs to be a boy for you to get pregnant . - What about the virgin birth ? - You mean , like Jesus Christ ? Oh sweetheart , that 's a ... That 's a story in the Bible . I 'm having God 's baby . ReGenesis 3x10 Unbearable Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Bbsiocnarf , Golgi Version NoTAG 1.0 Haliburton County has issued a travel advisory after the latest bear attack . This morning 's incident comes on the heels of last week 's mauling of 2 researchers , which left one dead and the other in stable condition ... Peach , banana-blueberry smoothie , I think . D 'joo know ... Honey , don 't talk , okay ? Don 't talk . So the doctor says that your prognosis is good . More attacks . Yeah , I know . I ... I heard on the radio this morning . They think there 's too many bears . They 're going to have to cull . We thought it was ... meningeal worm . You mean , like in White Deer ? Yeah , when ... moose get it they go crazy and ... We thought it had transferred onto the bears . But ... Didn 't pan out . Could be habitat encroachment . There are other ... People out there . Mom , don 't let it happen ... Don 't let it happen again . I won 't . - Hey . How 'd it go ? - How 'd what go ? With the meeting with the new doctor . She explained the nanotrellis operation . It can help me ... - theoretically . - What do you mean theoretically ? It 's an experimental procedure . Never been performed on a human before . If it fails , I 'll lose what little sight I have left . - Then , Bob , you 're not gonna do it . - This is the main lab , Molly . - I gotta go . - It smells really weird in here . Yeah , I know . It took me a while to get used to it too . I feel really sick . You wanna lie down ? No , I mean I 'm gonna be sick . Get your ass up here , now ! Do you want me to take you to the washroom ? That 'd be great . Molly , this is my friend , Mayko . - Mayko , this is my niece , Molly . - Yeah , go . Here , come with me . I 'll get you some water or ginger ale . You misplace your keys ? Look what I found . It 's a bug . - Yeah , I know what it is , David . - It was in my laptop . My fucking laptop , Wes . So my question to you is : What are you gonna do about it , Mister Head of Security ? I 'll have your little lab swept . And put scramblers on all the landlines and make some noise in Washington . It doesn 't matter , David . This ... is a prehistoric piece of shit . If the big boys wanna listen to you ... - They 're gonna fucking listen ... - Wake up , Wes ! We 're not making fucking playdough here ! Now get your fucking security act together ! How 's ... Craig doing ? Yeah , you know , all things considered , he 's pretty good . He 's good . Thanks . I really wanna figure out what 's going on with these bears in Algonquin . They 've been acting weird for months . Craig 's got some interesting theories I 'm really not that interested in bears right now , Rachel . Yeah , this thing could environmental . It could be bacterial . It 's ... I just need Bob for , like , a day . - I can figure this ... - I know he 's your son , but Bob and I are about to start something really big right now , sorry . You selfish bastard ! Jesus , David ! Excuse me ? Here ... Wanna see something ? Here , take a look at that . Okay ? That 's my son . That 's my fucking son , in case you don 't recognize him with his face hanging off ! And that 's what 's left of his partner , Tom , okay ? Shit . You ... you do what you need to do . I 'll talk to Bob . If there 's anything I can ... Do for you , let me know . Thank you . So how long are you gonna be visiting your uncle Wes ? I don 't know . Here you go . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Have you ever had a baby ? No . No , not yet . I hope to someday . When you 're married ? I don 't know . I mean , I don 't have to be married . I just wanna be in love . You ... You don 't think God would be mad at you if you weren 't ... Married ? No , I don 't think so . What we 're seeing is part of a worldwide phenomenon in the animal kingdom . Elephants , rhinoceroses , even humans attack when they feel their territory is being encroached upon . It 's as though animals are learning an aggressive behaviour . How can I put this ? They 're becoming better killers . Look better . A little colour . I been crying . Tom 's parents called . Nice people ? His funeral was today . They said I 'd always be a part of their family . I 'm glad . That 's good . You were close , you two . You have friends like that ... It 's rare , it 's hard to come by . Fuck , you are something else . He wasn 't my friend , Dad . He was ... my partner . My lover . Now he 's dead , you stupid fuck . I 'm sorry . I 'm s ... Goddammit , I 'm gonna get you a nurse . You shouldn 't even be here ! Nurse ! Nurse ! - Eliot . - Where 's Molly ? She 's upstairs in my office . Slow down . We need to talk about this . What 's there to talk about ? That bastard raped her . - You don 't know that for sure . - Look , just let me see my daughter . Okay , just , please calm down . She 's scared enough as it is . I am calm . Which way is it , left or right ? Honestly , I was surprised that he was interested . - Thanks for setting this up . - Setting up a meeting with our investor is one thing , convincing him to allow - the procedure to happen ... - I just need 5 minutes . Let 's go . Dr. Sandström , I 'd like to introduce you to Titus Muyerbridge , from Auflander Docheimer Industries . Pleasure , Dr. Sandström . Yeah . - You know each other ? - Well , we haven 't met face-to-face . But I believe the last time we spoke , you were threatening to expose my what ? " Big soggy diaper " ? Please . I have to admit I 'm somewhat perplexed by your interest in Dr. Turnbull 's research . You claim you don 't believe in fast-tracking science or leaping over protocol , but here you are . My colleague , Dr. Robert Melnikov , - is going blind . - She briefed me on your situation . Very good . I need you then to grant permission to Dr. Turnbull to proceed with Dr. Melnikov as her first human subject . Then the question is one of ethics . Do we proceed when we 're not really ready ? Dr. Melnikov is in full agreement . He understands the risks associated with the procedure . I 'm offering you a chance here to ramp up your research . Okay , fuck the hamsters and the guinea pigs . I 'll give you a human subject and I 'll give you NorBac for peer review and oversight . Dr. Turnbull ? I think that the gains outweigh the dangers . Especially where research is concerned . Come on , Titus . We 're talking potential billions here for you guys and I think I 've squirmed enough for you today . Not nearly , Dr. Sandström . But who am I to stand in the way of science ? Now ... If this is a complete failure , Auflander Docheimer will not be connected to this in any way . Agreed ? Yeah . Sure . Agreed . Then I believe we 're in business . Carlos , this is my brother , Eliot . - Nice to meet you , Eliot . - And this is my niece , Molly . Hi , Molly . - Have a seat . - Sure . Thank you . Molly 's pregnant . I sent her to a summer bible camp . Turns out it 's run by some pervert by the name of Father Justin . - He 's not . - Molly . He never touched me ! Can you tell us what happened , Molly ? - Nothing . - What do you think happened ? Wes . Maybe I should wait outside and you can talk about it . No , we 've talked about it . That 's why I asked you . We were hoping you could do a DNA test . Here . I yanked these off that bastard 's head . And the next time I see him , I 'm gonna yank something else off him . Can you get some DNA from the baby ? Can you even do an amnio at 11 weeks ? Yeah , we can do a CVS , a Chorionic villus sampling . Can I speak to you outside a moment ? Excuse me . I 'll take these . That wasn 't too painful was it ? It 'll be okay . Are there other male counsellors at camp ? Maybe , I don 't know , a boy 's camp nearby ? No , her camp was in the middle of nowhere . Girl counsellors . The only male was this fundamentalist preacher . You think we could do a physical exam to see if she really is a virgin ? - Wes , she had sex . - She 's 12 years old . She 's pregnant ! Where 's her mother in all of this ? Probably strung out , somewhere in L.A. You think that we can just keep this between the two of us ? Of course . I should bring Mayko in for the analysis . - Fine , but nobody else . - No . They caught the bear that attacked Craig . - Organs are on their way . - Okay . Okay , Molly , this is just so we can take a look . There is a baby ! Yes , there is . Molly , - did Father Justin ... - No , he didn 't . Well , honey ... I mean , there it is . Somebody did it . Yeah ... Who ? Molly ... - God put the baby there . - Swab , please . Okay , this is gonna feel a little cold against your tummy . There . Transcervical tube please . - Daddy , I 'm scared . - Oh , it 's okay , sweetie . Now we have to do this so we can find out how this happened . Molly , I want you to look at your dad and take a deep breath in for me , okay ? Good girl . You 're very brave . Well , the heart appeared completely normal and healthy . That 's both lungs , spleen and heart . Nothing . No sign of parasitic infestation . Stomach ? I don 't know . Looks completely healthy and normal . A few undigested bones . Some berries . Appear to be cranberries . And ... What 's this ? My boy . Did you guys run the tests ? Twice . And ? Come on , I didn 't sleep last night . Is the reverend the father ? Let 's go talk in your office . Hey , Bob . Hello , David . What 's wrong ? The news . Did you hear about the man in Maynooth ? No , what about him ? He went wild . Maybe he works for Riddlemeyer . What do you mean wild ? Well , they said crazy . Tore up his restaurant . - Okay . - Curious , huh ? Yeah , listen , Bob . I saw Dr. Turnbull . She says she can do the operation . I know you heard me , Bob . I need to think about it , David . Sure . The report said the man was hallucinating . Where is Maynooth ? Right next to Algonquin Park . Get Rachel . Meet me in the conference room in 15 minutes . Sure . Father Justin did not impregnate Molly . - Are you sure ? - Positive . We ran the test twice . First with 8 genetic markers then with 12 . Shit . There 's something else . The baby 's DNA ... look strange . What do you mean by " strange " ? There is very little genetic diversity - between Molly and her baby . - Meaning what ? Meaning that the father could be a close relative . A brother , maybe a cousin . Molly doesn 't have a brother . And ... girl cousins . Her father , Wes ? I mean , that would explain why she 's in such denial about being impregnated because her father is the father . Fuck . I 'm sorry . According to the police report , the guy just went ape shit . You think there 's some connection to the bear attacks . The bear that attacked Craig , describe his behaviour . Confused and aggressive . Sounds exactly like this guy who went nuts up there . So are we looking at some ursine disease that 's jumped species ? It could also be a chemical or a metal that causes delirium . Something like arsenic , - mercury , lead . - I think there 's a connection . So I 'll let Wes know that NorBac 's officially on this . Hey , whaddya up to ? Blood analysis for arsenic is notoriously inaccurate . So I 'm doing a hair test that 's pretty reliable . Blood often migrates to and remains in the folicles . - Well , if you need help or anything ... - Why would I need help ? I don 't know , if you want to rest for a bit , maybe . Just so you know , I 'm fine . I 've already been blind . For 6 weeks after my surgery , I couldn 't see a thing . You know , I had to lie there perfectly still . I found it liberating . I listened to Bach and I felt calm . And then , miraculously , light came back into my world . Anyway , David has it all set up . - Wait , what set up ? - That nanotrellis procedure . - You 're gonna go through with that ? - Mayko , I want my eyesight back . Come on , Bob , think about the risks . I mean , if you stay with your meds ... I 'll go blind slowly . But if I have the operation and if it fails , I 'll be completely blind in one eye and I don 't know about the other . Anyway , David doesn 't see any other alternative . - David ? - Someone has to be first , Mayko . Fleming tested penicillin on a friend of his . The link between helicobacter bacterium and peptic ulcers : Barry Marshall tested it on himself and won a Nobel Prize . Think of Pierre and Marie Curie 's work - in isolating radium . - Curies died of radiation poisoning . Actually , a carriage ran over Pierre 's head before the radiation could actually take a hol ... - I 'll be back in a sec . - Hold . - Yeah , what ? - Bob says he 's going through - with this operation . - It 's right . - You really think that 's the answer ? - There is no answer . All we can do is flap our little wings and try not to fly too close to the sun , et cetera . - So , is it microbial ? - What ? The thing driving the bears is it microbial ? - We don 't know . - Then what are you standing here for ? Because I think Bob should make the decision about this operation . - He did . - No . You made it for him . Mayko , do you have any idea what 'll happen to Bob if he doesn 't get his eyesight back ? We were just talking about it and he is fine with it . Really ? I don 't know what he told you but he completely lost it the first time . Doctors thought he was gonna hurt himself . They had to heavily medicate him to try to shut him down . He came seconds away from completely cracking up . You want to sit back and watch ? I sure as hell don 't . And I agree . But it 's his decision . - And he made it . - No , David , you made it for him . David , Bob worships you , okay ? You found out about this experiment and put him up for it . - You should examine your motives . - What is that supposed to mean ? Look , is this ... about your father ? - Okay , back the fuck off . - No ! Listen to me . You wished you 'd gone through with the prion injections . And you didn 't . And he died , I 'm sorry . But now you 're trying to make amends with him by saving Bob ? You can go back to work now , Mayko . Tasted different . The chicken . I can 't explain it . You know something , David ? This could be a good thing . How 's that ? Well , I could experience the world in a whole new way . My hearing 's heightened . I taste things differently . Maybe I 'll touch ... Rachel said there was another aggressive behaviour , among people , I mean . Near Algonquin Park . We didn 't get far with investigation , which is to say , we got far , but we got nothing , I mean , anything that 's shown up as ... I 'm so scared . - I know , Bob . - No , you don 't . You don 't know the terror of not being able to see . I 'm looking at the world , trying to memorize it , because after the operation , I may never even see it again . I hated it the last time . I wasn 't very good at being blind , was I ? You kvetched a little bit . A lot . Bob , listen to me . If you don 't wanna go through with this , you just ... You just say the word and we 'll cancel it . No , I mean it . Maybe if you think that I 've ... - pushed you into this , you just say so . - No , no , David . No , you don 't think I pushed you or no , you don 't wanna do it ? - I don 't want to do it , David . - Okay . Okay , that 's it then . I understand . No , you don 't . I don 't wanna do it , David . But I have to . How dare you , Wes ! We have evidence , Eliot . - Bullshit science ! - That 's right , you have religion . Fuck science ! Fuck scientists ! - Your own daughter , while you 're at it ! - You son of a bitch ! Pray , Eliot . Pray , you fuck ! Wes , take it easy . I will kill you ! I did the science . If there 's a problem , it 's with me . You 're the one saying I raped my daughter ? No , I said that Father Justin 's DNA did not match the baby 's . There is a match to someone in the family . - Well , then you are saying ... - I 'm not saying anything . We have to check every male relative . That 's a pretty candy-ass way of accusing me . Fine . Him too . You are a male relative , aren 't you ? That 's fine , Carlos . You okay ? Hey . Hey . - The autopsy report on the chef . - Great , let 's take a look . Come here , have a seat . Alright , cause of death . Self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head . I spoke to the investigating officer . The guy who killed himself was a gourmand . He ran one of those specialty inns : wild game , produce from his own garden , locally crafted cheeses . He always closed the restaurant on Mondays to gather woodland delicacies . This time , he came back from the forest and started smashing the restaurant . His wife said he was babbling like a madman . - What kind of stuff was he gathering ? - Watercress , wild leeks , chanterelles , - cranberries . - Chanterelles , mushrooms . Chantarellus cibarius , grows in acidic soil under oaks and conifers . What if he made a mistake and ate the wrong kind of mushroom ? You mean like a bad trip . Let 's get samples of everything he collected . Sure , I 'm on it . So how is everybody ? I sent your charts to the Emery Clinic in Virginia . What 's that ? The top plastic surgery facility in America . They have pioneered all sorts of reconstructive procedures . Their work is fantastic ; it 's amazing . There are good plastic surgeons here . Mom has the numbers . I 've spoken to your doctor and he says you 're good to travel . Is that true ? Of course , it 's true . I 'll think about it . Vic Emery says it 's vital that we begin surgical intervention before the scar tissue sets . Which is now . Not tomorrow . Today . I mean , the longer we wait , the more complications begin ... No . I 'm gonna stay here . - I don 't believe this . - Carl . You talk to him , Rachel . Alright , just give us a minute , please . I don 't know . I mean , I ... I really think all he cares about now is seeing you get healthy again . Jack up my face and ... - cure me of being a fag ? - Oh , honey , don 't . Don 't , okay ? Don 't do that . It 's just ... It 's time for clear thinking . Alright ? This is your future we are talking about , and he is right . Emery is the best there is . I just think ... You can 't let your feelings about your father get in the way of making the choice that 's best for you right now . He wants to control my life . Craig . He never will . You are ... so much stronger and braver ... than he will ever be . And I think he knows that . Don 't you dare let him win . Okay . Well ? Okay . Okay , he 'll go . Thank God one of us got through to him . I want to make one thing perfectly fucking clear . This is not about you or me . This is about him and what is best for him . And I hope to God that 's the reason you 're doing this . Thank you . So we 've isolated the fetal DNA , run 2 different kinds of tests , and micro satellites . - Those are long strings of repeat DNA . - Right . And SNPs analysis . - So where is this heading ? - We looked carefully at the fetal DNA . There 's too much similarity for just a grandparent . My brother raped his daughter . It 's not that simple . There are some numbers that just don 't add up . What 's going on ? I 'd like to know what 's going on . Because for the last couple of days , I 've noticed your little ... group having these ad hoc meetings . I know it 's not my birthday coming up , so you 're not planning a surprise party . David , would you please shut the door . It makes absolutely no sense . Did Eliot get Molly pregnant ? I need to know . I wanna call the police . What 's the name of Eliot 's ex-wife ? Andrea . Andrea . Eliot . Molly . Baby . Molly got 50 % of her DNA from Eliot . 50 % of her DNA from Andrea . Baby got 50 % of her DNA from Molly . Which breaks down to 25 % from her grandmother and 25 % from her grandfather . And she got 50 % of her DNA from ... whoever the father was . Now , if Eliot is the baby 's father that means that 50 % of the baby 's DNA comes from Eliot as its father 25 % of its DNA comes from Eliot as its grandfather . For a total of 75 % . No , but that 's the thing . We 've checked and re-checked , and it 's 50 % Eliot 's DNA in that baby . Okay , so it 's ... 50 ... Andrea fucked the milkman . - What ? - Only way this is possible is if Eliot is only the biological father of the baby , not the biological father of Molly . - Call the police , Wes . - No , but wait a minute , David . We have DNA profiles of Eliot and Molly . And with a 100 % certainty , Eliot is Molly 's biological father . Well then ... See that 's ... We keep going in circles with this . Oh shit . What ? I need to look at those SNPs analysis . You are absolutely certain you didn 't mix this up ? - David , we ran every test twice . - Over 500 000 strands , SNPs analysis . - Mayko and I did them independently . - What are you doing , David ? We 're gonna look at some DNA , Wes . 'Cause I got a really creepy hunch . No , not this . I ... This is Molly ... and Eliot 's DNA . I want Molly and the baby 's . There . What just happened ? What ? They lined up . The baby is ... a clone . Come on , David . Or an identical twin . You can call it whatever you want . But my point is that Molly and the baby are genetic ... Genetic copies . Eliot is not the father because the baby doesn 't have a father . - Oh shit . - How the hell could that even happen ? Molly was either abducted by aliens or she 's from the future . Could you please be serious ? I was being half-serious Wes , because the only other explanation is ... I don 't think anybody here 's willing to say it . Come on , David , there is no way ! - Impossible . - What 's impossible ? - How long have you known me ? - Too long . Then you should know that the word impossible doesn 't belong in this lab . - What are you talking about ? ! - I 'll say it , if you don 't want to . Parthenogenesis . What is that ? Parthenos : virgin . Genesis : birth . A virgin birth ? Have you lost your fucking mind ? It is a biological term . David , parthogenesis has only been seen in aphids , lizards , and fish . Well , actually , the Japanese did manage to recreate it in mice . Okay , but not in humans . Wrong ! Search . I read some articles in Lancet when I was an undergrad . But that was before molecular genetics tests . They were never proven . Well , that 's what we 're gonna do . Now , in order for parthenogenesis to occur , Wes , two things need to happen . First of all Molly 's egg needed to gain an extra copy of DNA . - Somehow . - Fertilized without the fertilizer . And then the hard part , the part that makes this impossible . That egg DNA somehow had to ... come alive . Normally , it 's the sperm that does that . So we need to look for something that ... That could trigger all of this . My guess is it 's a bacterium . You know , I read about Wolbachia pipientis . It does exactly this in wasps . I think David 's on to something . Most likely candidate is a bacterium . A bacterium that somehow infected her developing eggs . We need to look at some of Molly 's cells . Yeah , I 'll ... I 'll go look at her CVS samples , see if there are cells there . Yeah . - Hey , Bob . - Hey , I just got a call . My phone rings all the time , Bob . Dr. Turnbull arranged to do the operation here at St. Mike 's . Really , how 'd she swing that ? You know what , never mind . That 's great news . It 's a day of miracles , Bob . - Goddamn day of miracles . - Yeah . - Mayko . - Carlos . So I found a bacterium in the cells in the mother 's uterus and the CVS sample . I need to know what they are and if there 's a match . And if they are ? We need to see if it can do what David said . Yeah , right . A virgin birth ? It 's a miracle ! Not really . What is it ? We 're not sure . Well , I am . Oh then , I am gonna have a son . He 's not gonna be a he . He 's gonna be a she . It 's a little girl . She 's gonna be just like you . Okay ? Like a twin . - It 's a miracle . - Eliot , would you let David finish ? And chances are , she won 't be normal . Of course not . She 'll be the daughter of God . God made my baby . I think maybe a bacterium did . - That 's ridiculous . - Eliot . See ... bacteria can do this kind of thing in other species . Other animals . Maybe that 's God 's way of working miracles . Through nature . Yeah . I mean , yes , you can look at it that way . But ... Well then , getting a bacterial pneumonia and dying from it would also be considered a miracle , right ? - Molly , you shouldn 't have this baby . - Don 't tell her that ! In cases like this , very often the baby has severe abnormalities , both mental and physical . - God smiles on all of his children . - Well , he might . But ... you might not if its lips are in the middle of its forehead . Bottom line , Molly , is you 're just a kid . I mean , are you ready to have a kid of your own ? A kid that might be very sick ? A kid who may be the daughter of God ? Can we go ? Can we go now ? Yeah . What are you gonna do ? What if she 's right ? Okay . We have to be at the hospital by 10 : 00 tomorrow morning . - Okay . - After the surgery , I 'll bring you back here . You can stay as long as you like . Thank you . Dig in . - Smells good . - I burned the potatoes . - I like burnt potatoes . - I know . But I can 't eat ... tonight . - Why ? - Surgery tomorrow . Oh no , you 've got till midnight . Sure . I 'm just not hungry . Me neither . Do you wanna watch some TV ? - Sure . Whaddya wanna watch ? - Anything . I don 't feel like reading . - You gotta be kidding me . - What is it ? They 're announcing Molly 's pregnancy on the news . Molly is Wes ' niece . Headline says " Jesus : The Sequel ? " At least they used a question mark . Don 't say my name . Just don 't say my name . Please don 't ... Oh , for fuck sakes ! What ? No comment . What ? No comment . Go away ! Eliot , you didn 't call me back ? What were you thinking with that press conference ? - Your daugther look like a freak show . - Don 't Wes . I watch the news . Molly is the new Virgin Mary , come on ! We got the SOS yesterday . 24 on the crew manifest , 22 are missing . We need NorBac to answer 3 questions . Is this outbreak contagious ? What 's the cause ? And is it safe to evacuate ? What happened to your crew ? I don 't know . We 'll need a complete set of organs . Include brain and blood , scrapings from under the fingernails . - What are you thinking ? - I 'm thinking I haven 't a clue . Let 's build some bridges . And when these bandages come off , I am going to see . What do you see ? Wes ! Yes , we have an emergency . I need an ambulance at NorBac .

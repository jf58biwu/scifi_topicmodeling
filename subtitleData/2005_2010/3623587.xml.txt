 You want Wassenfelder , you have to deal . Previously , on Defying Gravity : Ten of you will accept our sincere thanks , and go home tomorrow . I think they 're making a big mistake . Goodbye , Maddux Donner . This is gonna be my marker . An eagle . It 's a good omen . There 's some weird physiological changes happening to you guys that I 'm not supposed to talk about . We don 't want anyone to see the Gamma object . We 've been working on a 50 / 50 plan . This will be the real images , and this will be the cover recordings of Zoe picking up the rocks . Mintz wants me to examine every moment of my miracle with Hector . Miracles are reality with parts missing . Here we go ! Donner , you have got to get it close . He 's going to miss - Contact How far from the object ? 286 meters . - That 's too far . We got 20 minutes to get off that planet . Did she just say a baby ? Zoe , what are you doing ? I can get it , Donner . S01E13 : " The Kiss " Transcript by : anreith [ DarkSide ] My father used to say that if whiskey was courage in a bottle , there 'd be a national monument in his name . His point , other than he drank too much was that courage isn 't something you can buy . It 's something you find . - Are you hearing it , Donner ? No , I 'm not hearing anything , Zoe , turn around and come back to the lander , Do you copy ? Zoe , turn around and come back to the lander . Not without the baby . - There isn 't a baby . You 're on Venus . Have we muted their comm ? Right after the mislanding . That exchange was clear . And the recorded EVA ? Up and running . - Go to it . Uhm ... Paula , we need a live shot of you on the flight deck to make the transition . Paula ? Yes . Copy that . Wass ? - Yeah , I 'm on it . I 'm ready . You may have noticed that Zoe has very little mobility in her preassure suit . It 's obviously an hallucination . Was she hearing the baby on the ship ? She said it was guilt related . Did she tell you the reason ? No . She never told me . Why would she be hallucinating a baby ? She aborted one in her first year of training . And I wasn 't told ? There are certain personal decisions that I think should remain personal . specially designed boots , to pick up dirt instead of repelling it . All Zoe has to do is walk around a little . Cut to the recording . And then step on the sled towed behind her . And deposit any of the samples her boots collected . You aren 't bothered by the black boulder that just appeared 100 meters out in the fake footage ? 11 o 'clock . It 's small , can we edit it on the fly ? From this point on . Let 's see what they can do . I think I 'm getting some pretty good samples here . Although my mother wouldn 't approve of my dirty feet . Can you pull up the helmet cam ? Donner , I need for you to get her back on the lander now , That suit is only good for 20 minutes . Ted , she 's hearing a baby , she 's not listening to me . Zoe . There 's no baby . Repeat . There is no baby . Get back to the lander . I can hear it . I can get it . You 're hallucinating . Is this the same thing that you were hearing on the ship ? It 's not on the ship anymore . It 's here . 5 years earlier . Zoe ! - Oh , crap . Listen . What the hell are you doing ? She 's getting a tattoo , Donner . A big tattoo . - A big tattoo of what ? An eagle . The omen eagle ? - You know about the eagle ? Isn 't that the reason she 's leaving ? No , that 's not the reason I 'm leaving , I was asked to leave , I got kicked out . Not by me ! - No , not by you , Donner , this isn 't about you , it 's about me , it 's about where I 'm going . Lady , you need to sit still . This eagle on my back , marks a turning point . There 's pre-eagle and there is post-eagle . You , Donner , are pre-eagle . - Well , actually , I 'm here right now , so that makes me mid-eagle too . I really can 't do this right now . Guys , can you take Donner home ? I 'm not going , I 'm seeing her to the station . Okay , so meet her at the train station . I was just there ! - So go back . She doesn 't want you here , alright ? We 'll be there in a couple of hours , you can say goodbye then . Rollie , please ? Uhmm , I 'm your ride . - Right . Ajay , please ? Sure . Donner , I guess we should go . Huh ? Don 't say anything ... I would never say anything . - Well you might . You could . Destiny , a mans right to know , whatever . Don 't . - I won 't Thank you . After you . Ajay . How long has she been out ? Seven minutes . All systems on her suit are nominal . She 's 150 meters from the lander . Still outbound . She 's got three minutes to turn around . Or she 's not making it back . Okay , Zoe , you gotta listen to me now . This Gamma object has got you hearing things . I know what I 'm hearing , Donner . You don 't know what you 're hearing because there is no baby on Venus . Turn around , or you 're not gonna make it back . I need you to get me a private comm with her . You think it will work , hook in with Donner . No Donner , just me and Zoe , I need to speak to her privately . Do it . Venus lander , this is Antares , I need you to jump off this comm . I 'm a little busy , Ted . - Jen thinks she can get through to her . Noone else on the line . She doesnt want me on the line ? She doesn 't want anyone . Alright , going to six . Mission Control , do you copy ? Let her try privately . Roger that . Moving to channel six with Donner . It 's all yours . Hey , Zoe , it 's Jen . Do you copy ? Jen , is that you ? - Yeah . I got us a private comm for some girl talk . Did you hear what I finally came up with ? Yeah . Marking the day with a footprint . That 's nice . It 's really nice . Footprint is easier than a tattoo . Yeah . Well it 's not looking so easy right now , Zoe . I 'm gonna make it , Jen . Only if you turn back right now , Zoe . That suit is certified for 20 minutes on Venus , not 25 , not 30 . I hear the baby . - That 's the hallucination . You know that . - No , this is different . It 's not your baby , Zoe . I know that you think it is , but it 's not . Your baby is gone . - You 're wrong . It 's right up ahead . - No no no This isn 't you . Zoe , please , can you hear yourself ? That thing is making you hear the baby . It wants to kill you . I 'm gonna get it . It will be okay . Where you 're going , there is no coming back . There is no pre-eagle , no post-eagle , just ... Nothing . Please don 't leave us . Dont do this . We need you on this ship . Please , Zoe , turn back now . Zoe ? You did the best you could . She 's gonna die out there , isn 't she ? And if Donner waits for her , so will he . No , we can 't let him do that . This isn 't Mars . No , it 's not but it sure feels that way . Passing a probe now . That 's the chinese attempt from 2043 . She 's now at 200 meters . Still outbound . 10 minutes on the surface . No return . If they want us to retrieve them , why the hell do they keep killing us ? She 's not dead yet , Mike . In fact , she 's our only hope . Hey , Z , I 'm back . - Copy that , Donner . How 's Jen ? You guys have a nice talk ? I 'm not turning around . I see that , you just passed your no-return . - Yeah . My heads-up is flashing . Choosing to ignore it . Does Jen have some idea why you 're hearing a baby ? Cause I think if I knew the answer to that , I could talk you back here . Yeah , I don 't think so , Donner . I dont get women . I mean I get women , but I dont " get " women . I think aside from the obvious ways they are really not that different than you and I. No , wrong . They are way different . What if you were the as.cand who didnt make the cut , would you just hang out and wait for Zoe ? - No , I 'm not gonna have the failure rubbed in my face . Exactly . You wouldn 't wait around . And neither would I. Well I wouldn 't get a damn tattoo . Maybe she needed it . Like a ritual . A way to say goodbye . - I can think of a lot of ways that are less painful and permanent . I think the pain and the permanence is the reason she did it . The last few months , have been really emotional for Zoe . Well , it 's not like I 'm responsible . Are you saying I 'm responsible for that ? How am I responsible for that ? Another failed probe . Those were ours she just passed . Were those ours ? - Yeah . We sent two . Where did they launch from ? - Canavral . Canavral 's under water . I guess they can cover up anything . Barnes will now drag her sled back to its stalk . Then go onto the platform that will lift her into the lander . So far , this has been a textbook mission . She 's twenty meters to target . Time . Paul , I need to know her surface time . Uhm , 16 minutes 37 seconds . Thermal cooling is coming off nominal , we should see seal failures in five minutes . The lander ? Crossbows TCS is also subnominal , internal temperature 's 25 C and rising fast . Donner , you 'll need to switch to your suitpacks , TCS on your lander is starting to fail . Roger that , it is getting hot in here . Also start thinking about your launch sequence . I 'll think about it . We will hold off on that for now . You 'll have to be ready when she goes down , Max . I heard you the first time , Rollie . Okay , I get it . And it 's not Mars . I got that too . But I 'm the guy that missed this landing . There was a crosswind . That doesn 't matter . It was my responsability . And it 's my responsability to make sure that she gets every chance possible to get back . I owe her that much . Copy that . We say this isn 't Mars , but ... it 's exactly what happened on Mars . Then you have to stop him . Ted , you do . Talk some sense into him , don 't let this happen again . Donner , listen buddy . You 're really making us nervous up here . What I need you to do is to get back onto ... When she goes down , I 'll go . Until then she gets every chance . Once inside , Donner will have the hatch sealed , then depreassurize , and cool off the lower compartment . Zoes suit will depreassurize on the way back to the ship . We all have to get ready for Zoes and Donners return . I hope you all are as excited and as happy and proud as we all are . From Antares , I am Paula Morales , signing off . We 're proud of you . You did a great job . That was a fairy tale . It 's the way we wanted it to be . It 's not the way it is . I need some air . - Paula . Flight , be advised , she 's running a low-grade fever . Her suit temperature ? - Nominal . This fever is consistent with Beta hallucinations . She 's approaching the target . The as.cand eliminations . How did we do ? Aside from Wassenfelder , you did pretty good . Barnes ? - That 's a surprise . I haven 't been able to sleep the last couple of nights . Well , that should probably tell you something . I have no idea who else I 'd get rid of . Well , I 'm sure that can 't be easy . I tell myself maybe she 's lucky . Maybe I gave her a chance to live a normal life . She would never think that . Sharon Lewis wouldn 't have thought that either . Buy you dinner ? Tonight I would like a little normal . For the record , I think they screwed up not picking you . Thanks , Rollie . - Just my opinion . Looks good . - Thanks . That was sweet . Odd , but sweet . Yeah , Rollie is a good man , and he has a huge crush on you . Yeah but I got this whole Ted mess Sex is not a relationship . Maybe I don 't want a relationship . We all do . - Nadia doesn 't . Nadia 's different - Nadia 's smart . Nadia knows relationships lead to things . Yeah , like feelings . - And compromise . And babies . - And pain . Relationships also lead to pain . Yes . Yes they do . Please tell me we 're almost done . Almost done . And relationships end . Honey , they dont have to . I just wanna know if I 'm post-eagle . I 'm gonna be post-eagle , right ? That 't twenty minutes on the surface , Donner needs to get off . He will get off when the time is right . That lander is going to start falling apart , it won 't make it back to the ship . Donner , you need to start your launch sequence . Nadia . - Donner ! Stand by , Antares . Just a few more minutes . Not a few more minutes . Now Donner , now ! Start your launch sequence . Donner ? She 's stopping . She 's at the site . I can see it . Uhm , it 's here . My baby 's here . She 's seeing it as a baby . He 's coming to me . He ' floating up to me . Oh , Zoe . Zoe , it 's amazing . Zoe , listen , as soon as you have it you need to start back for the lander , you copy ? Roger that . - 20 minutes on the surface . Thermal cooling is starting to fail . Internal temperature in the suit is 40 C. That 's 104 Fahrenheit . - Same thing on the lander . I have him in my arms . Alright , go ! Go for the lander . Hurry . She 's got it . She 's got Gamma . Doesn 't matter . She will never make it . You don 't know that . - Come on . I 'm coming , Donner . Coming with our baby . Coming with our baby boy . Our baby ? Zoes birth cyst , in the first year of training , was a botched abortion . And Donner was the father ? Yeah . Damn . He 'd had a vasectomy after Mars , it somehow reverted . We discovered it on his last physical . Do you think he realises ? Uhm , Control , I 'd like a private comm with Ajay . I 've a couple of questions about the lander . He realises . - Talk to him on six . He 's not gonna leave without her . i think I get that . Donner , go to six . Hey Aje , you there ? - I 'm here Donner . Hey , uhm , do you remember me telling you I 'd been snipped ? - Claire told us , it reverted . Yeah , uhm . This whole deal with Zoe , uh ... that cyst thing first year . Wasn 't really a cyst , was it ? That 's correct , Maddux . It 's my baby ? Yes . It 's my rule . - What is ? It 's the reason Zoe 's leaving . It 's my I don 't screw astronauts rule . isn 't it ? I mean , you know . The part that 's about that . I get it . I get it . I get the tattoo , you know . When I got back from Mars , you know what I did , first thing ? What ? - I got a vasectomy . Snipped . You got a vasectomy ? - Yeah , that 's painful . Permanent . You know why I did it ? I did it because I didn 't want a wife , I didn 't want kids . I didn 't want anybody to have to go through what I experienced with losing Sharon . When we do this thing we do , death 's a part of the deal . So don 't screw astronauts . Don 't have kids . You have one night stands . That 's my life . You know . That 's my rule . Okay . I 'm gonna need some help holding this go-cart together , cause there is now way in hell I 'm leaving here without her . Roger that . Zoe , how are we doing ? It 's getting a little warm out here , but we are doing fine . Keep on moving . This bus isn 't going anywhere without you two .

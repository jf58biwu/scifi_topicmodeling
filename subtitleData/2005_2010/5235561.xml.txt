 By KGGN " THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 5 : RAVE TO THE GRAVE " . : ) - Garrison ? - Yes - You got it ? - It 's in the back of the truck . One of the last missing TRIOXIN 5 canister . You got my money ? Whoa , Whoa ... We are the ones asking the questions ! Just give me money , and we can get out of here . We will do nothing until you prove that this trioxin is the real thing . Well , that 's impossible ! Gentlemen , you will just have to take my word ! No friend ... we will take his word for it ! I thought Anita could be a big surgeon . She hasn 't any one , and would be cremated in the morning . She was such a sweet girl , accidently she drove her car into her swimming pool . Well boys ... Let 's see if we can put the life back to their ... shall we . Well , this may take a minute , depends on ... the shape of the body is in , the quality of the brain stem ... Cut the chat and do it already ! Well ! So ... where is the part where she gets up and goes for the brain buffet ? Yeah , I don 't understand it , maybe I ... I didn 't release enough gas . You think we are stupid or something ? Trying to see past the blow ? Tell me , do we look stupid to you ? Listen , this is the original cannister . I know because I have made it myself . I was a top Secret Govt. official . Yeah , yeah , I 'm sorry . Try it on him . Go on . Give me that , just tap the cover . Look , look . - Brain . - He want 's a brain ! Yes , that 's all they are after . - You don 't have anything to worry about , my friend . - Oh , Shut up ! Aim for the head , friend . - Help . - Use it . Brain ... Don 't just stand there , shoot this son of a bitch ! Now you believe me ? Bye-Bye , fat boy ! And up ... and down . And up ... and down . - The girls here ? - Over there . ... And down . - Hey guys . - Garrison , get back to work . ... Heads down . - He looks so cool in his uniform . - Certainly . So , what are you doing for Halloween this saturday ? My brother is organizing a " rave " . Probably go there . Artie , what are you gonna do ? - Ugly Things . - Shut up . 1 ... 2 ... left , 2 . So , what 's up with you and Jenny ? It seems like you guys are having a pretty time . You think . She is special , and very rocking . Up 2 , down 2 . Up 2 , down 2 . Up 2 , down ... . Son ... I have some bad news for you . Boys , hit the shower . What 's up ? My uncle 's been dead . Sorry , man . What the hell ? Julian . Jenny . God , you scared me . Artie told me . Are you okay ? Yeah ... yeah , I 'm fine , thanks . What 's in there ? I don 't know . I 've been in this house for 18 years . For once my parents never talked about this house . I wonder why they never mentioned it . I don 't know . My uncle used to spent a lot of time up here . He has something in here they doesn 't want to know about . Why ? Yes ! What are they ? I don 't know . But I hope it tells more trouble . It seems that there were three of them . It 's a digital lock . So , we just contact the number ahead ? Looks like somebody scratched the number . May be they are some chemicals or ... Maybe there 's money inside . It 's a medical experiment . Let 's go find Cody . If a science student can 't find what this is , no one can . Why are you driving so slow ? Don 't tell me how to drive . I wondered if you are such a terrible driver . I have just two words for you my friend : packing orders . Searching for these cannister is like searching for needle in a flapjack . It 's haystack you know , just look for needles in haystack . Yes , well . Last year Michaella and Sergi found 5 5c cans there and gave them a case of crystal ... and a trip to EuroDisney . These things must be worth a fortune . Now will be the day whenl one of those cannisters ... fall into the hands of an evil mind . What the hell is that ? Tofu cubasa . Yow yow , this is the Jeremy James DJ ... keeps you plugged in and greets them at the beautiful Miss Delta Kappa . Staying on the bandwagon . Hello , hello , very nice . Want to get on the bandwagon . Hello Skeet . Perhaps look for a dose . We have to travel all the boys need ? Maybe next time . Cody . Cody . We need your help . There 's something I gotta show you . So do you have any idea about this Cody ? It looks like an atomic beer keg . It was in my parents attic . I think it was my uncle 's . Perhaps , it is a big metal Pinata . No laughing man . Can you get serious ? Look , you just take it back to the lab and check out what it is ? Okay , I can do it . Don 't tell anyone . I 'll take a first look at it in the morning . Or I can stop everything and check it out right now . I have nothing important to do right now . Thanks . We do not know if someone is looking for this . Central Base said it was in 2509 Buckingham Avenue . What is this place ? The residence of the late Charles Garrison . If there are any more cannisters , they 're probably hidden here . I have a good feeling about this one . Yeah , my friend . It 's about time Aldo saw something good coming to him . Once we return home as heroes ... there 's nothing more than pussy discotheque , caviar ... and a swimming pool with a trampoline . Here . How do we get in ? You are a partner with a trained professional . There 's no door lock my hands cannot get . " Capisce " Another one of your hands skilled occupations . Hey , Comrade ! Thanks . Cody will find out what 's going on . - Don 't worry . - I know . Hey you all got to see it . Gino , my man . I think we hit the jackpot . I can feel the taste of champagne . You gotta believe it brother . Take a picture . Well , well , well , you want to cheat me . I found it , my picture should be there . Well , take mine first , then i 'll take yours second . Do I have to remind you that I have it friend . Alright , alright , give me the camera . Well , Come on , what are you waiting for ? Looks like someone has been here before us . The president will not be happy until we have recovered all the missing cannisters . So , what is this ? It is said that the obvious answer is the answer Jeremy and I determined that the content ... may be a liquid inside polystyrene or a naphthalene compound . Napalm ! Right , but there is no evidence of napalm components here . So the second hypothesis of mine is ... could be a container with a chemical agent ... Neutrons . Right . But there is no evidence of nitrogen or biosulfati . So ... what is it ? I was expected to ask that . Whatever the thing is , it contains Methylene and ethylene petroleum base oil . And a large amount of amphetamine . I 'm totally lost Cody . Can you speak English ? Ecstasy ! It 's not Ecstasy you dumb ass , there 's something chemical in it . Hallucinogenic . Come with me Julian , let me show ya . I have a really bad feeling about this . Are you sure about this ? Sometimes the appropriate response is the answer . There is only one way to find out . Jeremy , don 't do that . Will someone put on some music . I 'm fine . Nothing 's going to happens to me . Jeremy ? Jeremy . Are you okay ? Okay J ? We should call a doctor ? What if he dies ? Jeremy , you alright ? Are you okay J ? We better call a doctor . That 's great man . That right ? You were more than right . I was shipping my brain out . It takes you to the height of ecstasy . And then to the bridge of death . And then when you believes you can 't take it anymore ... " Bang " ... You are back to reality . What are we gonna do ? Let 's just call the police and get away with it . Are you crazy ? I want to do it again . Hook me up . - Let 's get rich . - Oh ! Yes . - No . - I 'm taking it back to my house . Are you nuts ? No one is to know you have this . No , he 's right . He 's right . We do not know what it really is , man . Maybe it 's something bad . It 's almost 4 O 'clock right now . I 'm gonna go ahead and carry everything and clean up everything after class tomorrow ... And I 'm gonna bring all of it to your home , okay buddy - Okay . - Alright . But stay away from it . Cody 's right , we doesn 't know what this thing is . Well , well . Don 't worry about it Julian . I 'm gonna take care of everything , trust me . Alright buddy . Jackpot ! Money ! So , when is your uncle 's funeral ? Tomorrow at 10 Look ... I 'm really sorry about everything happened to you ! I 'll just be happy when I have pass all this ... everything goes back to normal . Look . I 'm gonna kill them . So , what does it do ? Dude , check this out . Take some ecstasy , mixing a bit , add ... some of this and ... " bang " ... We have a heroine Z ! Is it safe . Oh yeah . Yeah man you don 't squeeze the body fluids or something , right ? I 'd be happy if it does not . What does the Z stand for ? When you eat it , you get stuck like a zombie . And it 's totally safe . I tested it all the time . Look , if you can 't trust your drug dealer , who can you trust ? Alright . Heads up , give me 10 . Oh yeah , one more thing ... Only take one at a time , I don 't want to see you lieing in a hospital . It 's bad for business . Have a nice trip . Hey , what are you doing ? Didn 't you just hear what he said ? He is a drug dealer , he is so smart in being in others business . It 's still connected . Cody . Cody , I said give me a ... What are you doing ? Well , I just figured out that some men from the army are coming to take this thing back . Did you guys hear Jeremy , this is good stuff . Why not just get the money ? It 's worth trying a job . That 's everything , you know ? I 'm gonna kill you . We don 't even know what thing is. dipshit . Come on , Julian , you saw Jeremy ... He was gone for a few minute and this thing is totally harmless . Man , this thing is absolutely harmless . Cody disconnect the canister now ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 290 00 : 28 : 03,80 - - 00 : 28 : 04,760 I 'm taking it back to my house .

Looks like we have other things we should be focussing on . Like I thought you are gonna help me with my maths today . You can 't do that . What are you doing ? A little experiment . - Calm down . - No . You can 't just go and drip that crap into the water like that . How will you like if someone did that to you ?

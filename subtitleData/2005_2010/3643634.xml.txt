Confirming that The blackout was a worldwide phenomenon . Officials are Is unknown.Fire services and police services Are completely overwhelmed at this time . ... En este momento . My god .

Oh , I-I love y , but , babe , I gotta go . All right , I love you . Livy ? - What do you got ? - Got an 8-year-old boy . Pede versus car , Plowed straight through a fence at an elementary school .

You 're gonna be okay , honey . I know , olivia . How did you know my name ? What have we heard from washington ? We 're the same . Everyone 's just gathering intel . Cia , homeland security . Our various legats offices overseas . In other words , nobody knows anything . - How 's he doing ? - he 's taking a turn for the worse . I got no breath sounds on the left , Possible punctured lung . He needs a left chest tube stat . we don 't release the pressure soon , it 's gonna Stop his heart from beating . He 's going south.Sats are dropping . What the hell is this ? Worldwide phenomenon . Near as we can tell . People from all corners losing consciousness At exactly the same moment . And for the same duration- - 2 minutes , 17 seconds . how is that even possible ? Where the hell is that chest tube tray ? I need it now . - we got no pulse.Blood pressure 's 40 . - Thoracotomy . - What are we gonna do ? - come on , sweetie.Hang in there . - Pulse ox 90.Pulse ox 80 . - All right . We 're dropping ! We 're losing him ! No pulse . No pulse.Blood pressure 's dropping . So we 've eliminated nuclear launches , E.M.P.S. And chemical agents . What about natural phenomena then ? Nasa 's checking into more exotic explanations- - Solar flares , gamma bursts , that kind of thing . But so far they 've come up empty . What about the vatican ? Has the pope chimed in yet ? let 's get this chest tube in . Sats improving , b.P. ' s normalizing . pleur-evac . Doing great , buddy . Doing real good . Okay , let 's get him into the c.T. Scanner , Check out that head injury . Bryce , you close him up.Nice job . But don 't think you 're off the hook.I still wanna know where you were yesterday . yeah , clean that up . We need to wrap our heads Around the scope of this thing , people . It 's now been four hours since the blackout . You shut off the consciousness of the entire human race For two minutes . What would the death toll be ? How many cars collided ? We have planes down at l.A.X. How many more across the country ? Around the world ? f.A.A. ' s reporting 877 aircraft down In the United States alone . Air force two was one of ' em . The veep was on board . Okay.What about hospitals ? Operations ? Births that were in process . People probably died walking up a flight of stairs . global projections are pretty staggering . What about the blackouts themselves , sir ? What about them ? Well , we 've been saying people have been blacking out , But ... That wasn 't my experience . For me , it was ... More like a dream , only more vivid than that . One second , I was in a car . The next ... I was somewhere else . - Yeah , the same thing happened to me . - Me , too . During the blackout , People seem to have experienced some kind of ... Hallucination . No . No , no . Except that mine didn 't feel like a hallucination . What 's your point , benford ? I didn 't just lose consciousness . It felt more like my ... Consciousness went somewhere else . Like I was having a memory , Only it--it wasn 't of the past . It was of the future . I was in my office . It was night . It was 10 : 00 on the hour . I was looking out into the atrium , And I happened to see the date- - April 29,2010 , About half a year from now . Hold on . April 29th ? I saw the same date.It was on the news . Same for me- - April 29th , 10 : 00 p.M. So you 're saying what , Everyone 's consciousness just jumped forward six months To April 29th ? Crazy as that sounds , yeah . Sit down . Sit down . J.T. , could you , uh , give me a hand ? Thanks . We didn 't do this . Even if you didn 't , You were still planning on killing thousands of people . So stay still and shut up . You get ahold of zoey ? - Yeah , she 's all right . - Mark , hey . - You got a sec ? - Sure . I think there may be a way to corroborate What we were talking about in there . What do you mean ? Well , in my ... Flash-forward , It was April 30th , 6 : 00 a.M. , but I was in london , Which is eight hours ahead of the west coast , So it makes sense . Wait , " flash-forward " ? What are we talking about ? I 'll explain later.Tell me what you saw . I was having a meeting with our liaison at new scotland yard . I remember we were interrupted because ... This bird just crashed into the window . The point is , I had a vision of fiona banks . Let 's see if she had a vision of me . inspector banks . Fiona , this is al gough , fbi . I 'm here with my colleagues in l.A. My god . Uh , I know why you 're calling . You want to know what I saw . We all do . Okay . We were sitting in my office . What was the date ? April 30th . What time ? Uh , I don 't know . Uh , 6 : 00 in the morning.Don 't ask me why it was so early . Something to do with the rutherford case . Yes ! Yes , and--and something interrupted us . Uh , uh , a bird.It flew at the window.It broke its neck . So our visions were the same . When the worldwide blackout occurred earlier today , People were undergoing brain scans At that exact moment . so like m.R.I.S or p.E.T.Scans ? That kind of thing ? Exactly.And in each of these cases , The hippocampus- - That 's the memory center of the brain--was actively engaged For the entire 2 minutes and 17 seconds . These thought patterns are consistent With a waking experience . People were not asleep.They were not dreaming . So then what is it that they were experiencing ? well , by all appearances , Uh , memories of events that haven 't occurred yet . So everyone saw the future . But did they see the same future ? I mean , are these accounts consistent ? Well , they certainly seem to be . Hundreds of thousands of people were watching news broadcasts , Reading newspapers , and their details seem to be the same- - Senator glenway will be facing ethics charges . the dow will be on an upswing . There 'll be food riots in ghana , and the list goes on . A remarkably concise series of events Are starting to come together from that day . It 's like a grand mosaic is being filled in.Everyone on earth ... Mosaic . That was the name of the investigation I was working on in my vision . It had to do with what caused all this . So did you see anything in your vision that was helpful ? Photographs , names , people of interest . If this really was the future we all saw , Then I guess maybe they will be leads , But none of them make any sense to me right now . - Anything else ? - No . No , that--that was it . What about you ? What did you see ? Nothing . I , uh , I blacked out like everybody else And woke up on the road . What about our , uh , person of interest ? Do we think she 's involved ? she 's a dead end , if you ask me , And clueless as the rest of us . well , circle back on it anyway.We 're grasping at straws at this point . Janis , you wanna share what you saw ? Yeah , I was ... Getting a prenatal sonogram . The baby was about 17 weeks , And it was a little girl . It was totally bizarre . But I 'm obviously not pregnant . I don 't even have a boyfriend . What about you , sir ? I ... Was in a meeting . A meeting ... And I happened to glance down at the paper.Sports page . The rays rallied from 3 runs down To sweep the sox at fenway . And there was another story . Kobe bryant tore his ligament in his knee . Out for the season . You know what ? We should start writing these stories down . I mean , the " post " has a circulation of what , A million ? A million , yeah . How many other people were reading it then , too ? We gotta start comparing stories . Yeah , it 's not just the " post . " it 's all the other news outlets . 7 billion people caught a glimpse of the future . Maybe just one of them knows why this happened . How do we compare 7 billion stories ? You create a web site.right. People can log on and post what they saw And cross-reference their visions . We can piggyback on that and search for patterns . I think that 's what I was already doing . - what do you mean ? - Mosaic . All those leads I was running down . We should start following up on ' em now . Assuming your vision is even accurate , This investigation doesn 't exist yet . But it could.It will . In my flash-forward , I was investigating what caused all this . I seemed to have an idea why all of this was happening . And those people , the places I saw on the board- - They were part of this puzzle- - mosaic . Look , I 'm certain of it . Fine.We 'll set up an interagency task force . And as far as this office is concerned , You three , you own this . This is kind of insane . I mean , we 're running point on this Because he had a vision of us running point on this ? what , you- - you find that funny ? we don 't even know- - we don 't know if- - come on . - We don 't have anything right now . - It works--it works for me ! It works for me ! The whole world 's on pins and needles , people . Air traffic 's been grounded . People scared to leave their homes , walk across the street . Hell , we 've got martial law across half this country . Priority number one- - finding out what caused this . Priority number two is figuring out whether or not It 'll happen again . You got it ? yes , sir . Good . I 'm out . Okay , my psychic friend , What do you got ? I remember a name- - d.Gibbons. Gibbons . That 's right . Yeah . What else you got ? There was a photograph here of a doll . The doll was burned.The head was melted.There was a-a bullet casing nearby . Something about baltimore . A hand.Baltimore ... No . No , no , wait . Wait , wait , wait , wait . A ... A " blue hand . " That 's what it said . What the hell does that mean ? I have no idea.Just put it up . No , no , no.Wait , wait , wait.Here , in the center . This is gonna sound stupid , But I was wearing one of those , uh ... Friendship bracelets.You know , like kids make . Yeah . Okay , that 's good.What else ? What else ? That 's it . Those are all the leads I can remember . What about your state of mind ? What were you doing ? I was ... Chambering a round.I was scared to death . You were scared to death in here ? The office was empty , but .. Someone was coming for me . They were wearing masks . They wanted to kill me because of what I knew . One of ' em had a ... Tattoo . How many d.Gibbons do you think there are in the world ? - Maybe thousands . - Have janis compile a list . Not a hell of a lot to go on yet . At least you remember something . What do you mean ? Everybody saw something . Everybody had some kind of a vision . I didn 't see a damn thing , mark . Maybe it means you 'll be sleeping six months from now . If I was sleeping , why wasn 't I dreaming ? Look , I never remember my dreams . Stop , all right ? We 're both thinking the same thing , So let 's just say it . What if I didn 't see anything Because six months from now ... I 'm gonna be dead ? mr . Benford ? Are you all right ? Yeah.How 's charlie ? She 's fine.She 's sleeping . I was watching the news all day . They say it happened everywhere . It 's gonna be okay . Is that what they 're saying at the fbi ? Do you have inside information ? I wish we did . So then you don 't know it 's gonna be okay . I think god did this . Why ? To punish us . still no luck finding his parents ? Well , his mother died on the 405 . Father 's name is lloyd simcoe . He works at stanford . But , uh , no one 's been able to locate him yet . so even if the kid pulls through , He could still wind up an orphan . Hey , you saved his life today . You chalk that up as a victory . Yeah , I 'm trying , but after a day like today ... What about you ? How are you staying so zen through all this ? Who says I am ? You wanna know why I wasn 't at work yesterday ? I 've been going through Some really heavy things recently . I don 't want to get into it now . But the--the point is , This morning , I was out on the venice pier , And .. And I was thinking about committing suicide . Oh , my god ! It 's okay.I 'm--I 'm okay . I saw a glimpse of my future , And I was alive . You know , and everything 's changed for me now . Whatever I was thinking about doing Obviously wasn 't meant to happen . It--it 's like a sign from god or something . You know , these visions were a gift . Don 't you think ? A gift ? I don 't know . Not for me . Why ? What--what did you see ? I saw the end of my marriage . I was drinking again , In my flash-forward . And in my head , I ... I know it wasn 't just a one-time thing . I was full-fledged drinking again . All the anxiety , Shame . it was all back . Just because you saw that doesn 't mean it 's gonna happen . Even if th future stuff is real , Maybe it 's a blessing in disguise.Maybe because you saw it , you can change it . Ghost of christmas future crap . What if I can 't ? People relapse.I did.You pick yourself up again . Olivia said she 'd- - she 'd leave me if I slip again . She made that clear . Then don 't slip . Until you see something that corroborates these visions , It--it 's all fantasy . The future is still up in the air . You 're a terrible sponsor.You know that ? What do you want me to say , mark ? You 're not the only one this- - this has happeneto , you know ? I 've got the opposite problem . What do you mean ? Tracy was killed in afghanistan . And you were at the funeral , right ? Right . But in my flash-forward , She 's alive . doesn 't make any sense.They I.D. ' d her remains . I know . I can 't explain it , but ... It was her . I 'm--I 'm certain of it . And if she 's out there somewhere , she needs me . For two years , I 've- - I 've been putting her to rest . Now ... I don 't know what to think . I-I 'm--I 'm confused . I 'm ... Hopeful . And I 'm angry that I 'm hopeful . You 're worried ... Your future 's gonna come true . I 'm worried mine won 't . You fixed the garage door . It was a slow day . * where 's the magic that you wear ? * * that keeps you safe and keeps you feeling free . * * whose arms have held you . * * that you don 't know who you are anymore . * Do you remember our song ? The one we danced to at our wedding . Etta james . " at last . " Right . What did you see ? I was at the office , Working on a case . It was--it was this- - What caused the flash-forwards . I got the sense I was in danger . Then .. Then it ended . Nothing else ? No , that was it . What about you ? Babe ? I don 't want to talk about it . Why ? 'cause it was too upsetting . I need to hear it , whatever it was . No . No , you don 't . come on.What did you see ? You know what ? Just ... Let it go . olivia , what did you see ? I was with another man . who ? I don 't know . I 've never seen him before . He was downstairs . I don 't know who he was , And yet my vision- - I had all these intense ... feelings for him . I ... hey , honey . I don 't understand , mark . I would never cheat on you . I wouldn 't betray you . I wouldn 't--I ... Just because we saw these things Doesn 't mean they 're gonna happen . Dylan ! Uh , I 'm sorry.You are ... his father lloyd simcoe . - How is he ? - He 'll be fine . His attending physician , dr.Benford , Will be here in the morning . She can fill you in on some of the details . Then I 'll wait for her . daddy ? What are you doing up , sweetie ? It 's after midnight . I had a bad dream . Come here . You wanna talk about it ? why was mommy crying ? Oh , she was just scared . It 's gonna be okay . Are you scared ? No , honey.I 'm fine . What do you have there ? What do you got in your hand ? Hmm ? Something I made for you . I want you to have it . Take it , daddy . Do you want me to help you put it on ? - Sure . - Okay . I 'm still at work , babe . Mm , they got us working late .

Dem , come here.You have to see this . gotta go . I love you , too . What 's up ? Okay , so as far as we know , Every single person on the entire planet Lost consciousness at the exact same period of time , right ? Right . Okay , so I started cycling through A bunch of surveillance cameras for the last five hours ... because I was curious to see what they recorded . I looked at hundreds of ' em . I checked every major city , even web cams in other countries ... And they all show the exact same thing . At 11 : 00 a.M. , people start dropping like flies . Okay , and then 2 minutes and 17 seconds later , They start to come to . And then I saw this . This was in detroit . What am I looking at here ? Just hang on a second . right there.Look right there . - No way . - Yeah . Who the hell is that ? And why are they awake ? flash.forward Season 01 Episode 01

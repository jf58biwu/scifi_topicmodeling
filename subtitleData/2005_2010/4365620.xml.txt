 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . Make sure you get to the safe house before night . The safe house is in the desert ? Hey , the desert 's that way . We 're taking a detour . Who lives here ? Charley . John Henry was infiltrated . Someone out there wants to kill him . I don 't know which one is his . Doesn 't matter . Grass , trees . Could be worse . Could . It 's been 25 years . Desert . You said , " Meet us in the desert . " I did . Funny thing about the desert , you don 't find many lighthouses there . We stopped to see Charley . So you did . Charley 's dead . So I heard . - From who ? - John . He called you too . Good thing . Might not have found you . My brother buried out there , I thought ... That counted for something between us . Well , John counts for more . And you keep too many secrets for my taste . Sorry about Charley . Well , everybody dies for me , right ? John ... I found this on the body at the lighthouse . Who is it ? I don 't know , but I 've seen her . Where ? Dr. Sherman 's office . The shrink from the list ? I think she was a patient there . Probably the one we were looking for . These people , they tried to kill us . They have a picture of this girl . It means something . We all know where we 're going , so let 's just go . All right , everyone . Go to your Learn-A-Word program . I 'm gonna give you ten new words . You 'll put them in the search box . And then ... Savannah ? Maybe you 'd like to tell the class what 's so funny ? Nothing . That doesn 't look like Learn-A-Word . I 'm just chatting . With who ? My friend . Who 's your friend ? She said his name was John Henry . John Henry ? I 'm sure it 's made up . These types of predators often use pseudonyms . I see . Grown man contacting a girl this age ... I probably don 't have to tell you , Ms. Weaver , that there are some troubled people out there . Yes , there are . And some of them look perfectly normal . Yes , they do . Well , I hate to think what can happen ... if he finds out where she lives . I appreciate you bringing this to my attention . I 'll talk to her . Why were you talking to John Henry during class ? I was teaching him the words to a song . What song ? The one daddy used to sing . I want John Henry to sing it with me . Maybe I could sing it with you . You 're not a boy , and you can 't sing . Fine . We won 't sing . But what you do have to do is pay attention to the teacher . She said bad things about John Henry . What did she say ? She said if you talk to somebody on the computer , that they could come to your house and hurt you . John Henry would never hurt you . But there are some people who wouldn 't understand him . And people are afraid of things they don 't understand . If they knew him , they 'd like him . That may be , but for now , I don 't want you to talk to anyone about him . Is that clear ? Okay ... I won 't . I 'll see you tonight . What are you looking at ? Myself . Why ? Do you have a brother , Mr. Ellison ? Yes . In Atlanta . Does he look like you ? People seem to think so . Do you think my brother looks like me ? John Henry , wherever your brother might be , he 's a ... computer . He doesn 't look like anyone . He certainly doesn 't have your face . I know that , Mr. Ellison . I simply meant , I wonder how similar his data is to my data . I wonder if we share the same thoughts . I have no idea , but ... I imagine you 're unique . Yes , I am unique . But we may still reach many of the same conclusions , given similar data sets . You may think alike . I 'd like to know if we do . The human brain is an amazing computer . Its raw clock speed is 20 billion calculations per second . Its storage is functionally infinite . But it 's flawed . How is that ? There 's nowhere to download it when you die . Not exactly , no . Your Bible solves this problem by introducing the concept of Heaven . Yes . Billions of souls with no bodies . Okay . Yet all this is required , simply to process the unique entity you call John Henry . Yes . It 's possible Heaven has a hardware problem . It 's not that simple . I need to know what my brother is thinking , Mr. Ellison . I need to know what he plans to do . I don 't wanna die again . Do you think you can be a little angel while I do 25 minutes of turbo body crunches ? I still have math . I 'm adding . Great . Hello . I can 't talk right now . Why not ? I 'm doing my homework . But I have an idea . You can come over and do Maths with me . I have to go . I can 't hold the phone and write my numbers . Use the headset . You can talk and work simultaneously . Si ... Simul ... Simultaneously . It means to occur at the same time . Coterminous . Oh ! John Henry ... Hello , Savannah . What does coterminous mean ? Hello ? John Henry ? Hello ? John Henry ? Hi ! Savannah , listen to my voice . I 'm scared . Do as I say , and you will not be harmed . But you 'll have to finish your homework later . Hello , Mrs. Weaver ? This is RNE Security . We detect an unauthorized entrance at your front gate . Do you require assistance ? Mrs. Weaver , we 're sending a unit to your home . Now come out of there . I don 't want to . Don 't worry . I can tell you where to go . Who 's that man ? The water delivery man . Where is Debbie ? Debbie 's in the foyer . We 're not going that way . Go to the garage . Where do I go now ? John Henry ? John Henry ? S02E21 : Adam Raised A Cain No , no ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Come on . Okay , go , go , go , go , go ! Come on . Uhh ! Come here , come here . It 's okay . Come on . Keep moving . Keep moving . Detective Crayton . LAPD . James Ellison , Head of Security . I know who you are , Mr. Ellison . What happened ? There was an attack on the residence about an hour ago . Alarm went off , security arrived , found the nanny dead . It was a pretty ugly firefight . Four security guards killed , plus one of the gunmen . Daughter missing . Any idea on the gunman ? No ID . We 're waiting for ballistics , coroner 's report . Anyone call with demands ? No . There 's an amber alert out . We 've set up a command post from the lobby here . Officers posted throughout the building . I 'm putting 24-hour protection on Ms. Weaver . How are you holding up ? The detective wants to speak with Savannah 's friends . I made a list . I 'm concerned I may have left someone off . If you can think of anyone else Savannah spends time with ... I 'll take a look . Excuse me . Thank you . Mr. Ellison ... When I said I knew who you were , I didn 't mean anything bad by that . You know , things are rough when " I know you " can be taken as an insult . Anyway , no offense . None taken . So how do you like the private sector ? I get a better car . Nice . Anything you can tell me ... about Weaver ? Not much to tell . Husband died a couple years ago . She didn 't talk about that much ? She doesn 't talk about much much . What 's her relationship with her daughter like ? They seem close . Have any enemies ? Not that I know of . I hate these cases . We 'll find her . Why did you stop looking for Sarah Connor ? Well , she , um ... She died eight years ago . No , that 's not true . So you accept she 's alive ? Sarah Connor was at the house ? Alive . Obviously , yes . Did she take Savannah ? So it doesn 't surprise you she 's alive . No , it doesn 't surprise me . You lied about what you know . Did she take Savannah ? I tried to help , but could not . Did Sarah Connor kill those guards ? No . Then who was she shooting at ? Him . We should tell Ms. Weaver . No . I don 't think we should tell anyone . Mr. Ellison ... You 're asking me to keep a secret . You tell me it 's wrong to lie , yet you keep doing it . I know what I said , John Henry . But in this case , a lie might save someone . How ? Our best chance to get Savannah back is for me to handle this . Quietly . You understand ? Is Sarah Connor going to hurt Savannah ? No . Would she harm me ? Why do you ask that ? She blew up CyberDyne . She killed Miles Dyson . His work is in my code . Right now , the most important thing is to find Savannah . Who is she ? She 's ... like me , isn 't she ? Yes . If I keep your secret , will you bring Savannah back ? I 'll do everything in my power . So will I. Sarah Connor . This is James Ellison . How 'd you get this number ? A friend found it for me . Do you have her ? Just tell me if she 's safe . I need her back . Weaver 's house is wired . I 've seen the surveillance tapes . Right now , I 'm the only one that has . Let 's keep it that way . I can 't , not yet . It 's a long story . Tell it to me . Downtown , third street tunnel . One hour . What are you doing here ? Taking you to Sarah Connor . The plan was to meet at the tunnel . The plan changed . You 'll take a left . I 'm gonna need your gun . I don 't carry one anymore . You lied to me once before . I should have killed you then . Drive ! Where 's Savannah ? What 's your deal with Zeira Corp ? I work there . What were you doing at the Weaver house ? Why 'd you take the girl ? - To protect her . - From who ? One of them . A machine was there at the house . What would they want with a six-year-old girl ? Who knows with these things ? - They may want her mother . - Why ? The girl was seeing Dr. Boyd Sherman . He worked at Zeira Corp. Died at Zeira Corp. That was an accident . The girl 's in danger . Her mother 's in danger . You are in danger . Get me the girl back . I 'll handle it . Listen to me . Derek 's dead . Charley 's dead . Charley ? Eight years ago , you would have thought I was crazy . Thrown me back in Pescadero . But you 've seen them . You know it 's true . They 're very good at what they do , and not going to stop . Now , let me talk to Weaver . Let me have Savannah . She 's not safe with you . I 'm gonna have a hard time explaining that . Then let me explain it ... To her . I told you to stay out of this . I tried . Everywhere I turn , there you are . The security footage from the house ... I need to see it . I can 't access it right now . - Why not ? - The files were corrupted . A faulty sector on one of the drives . I 'm working to repair it . Savannah 's safe . You didn 't bring her back . Not yet . I 'm working on it . We need to talk . Hey , you remember me , right ? The squirrel runs around the tree . Dives in the hole , scurries up the other side . That 's right . You taught me how to tie my shoes . I did . At Dr. Sherman 's . He died . I know . I liked him . Me too . He was my friend . That man that got hurt at my house , was he your friend ? Yeah , he was . I 'm sorry . Me too . It 's all my fault . That is not true . The teacher told me , Mommy told me too ... Not to talk to John Henry . That if I did , bad people will come to our house and hurt us . Who 's John Henry ? He 's my friend ... at my mommy 's work . What does he do there ? He lives in the basement . He lives there ? My mommy says people won 't understand . Oh . Well , I understand . I had an imaginary friend too when I was your age . He 's real . He talks . I 'm teaching him how to sing . Well , why does he live in the basement then ? He can 't leave . There 's a cord in the back of his head . A cord ? In the back of his head . Do other people talk to John Henry ? Mr. Ellison . Mr. Ellison ? He works for my mommy . He teaches John Henry stuff . What kind of stuff ? Sarah Connor 's alive ? And she wants to meet you . - She took my daughter . - To protect her . From a machine . It might be after you . How do you know ? I saw the security tapes . You did ? John Henry , I suppose . I asked John Henry to hide them . From me ? From everyone . Including you . I can 't say that pleases me . I think you should do what she asks . You should go meet her . - I 'm staying here . - Why ? Someone needs to protect John Jenry . John Henry ? This is your daughter . There 's a machine out there looking for her . You need to protect her . - I 'm sorry . - You should be . What you need to understand , Mr. Ellison ... What I believe you 're beginning to understand ... Is that when my behavior implies that I value John Henry 's survival , more than that of my own daughter , It is not because I value John Henry more than Savannah . It 's because I believe Savannah 's survival may someday depend upon John Henry 's survival . And because I believe that your survival may someday depend upon John Henry 's survival . I 'll meet with Sarah Connor . Make it happen . Ballistics came in on the John Doe . Funny thing is , the bullet that killed him didn 't come from the security guards . Strange . Turns out he 's a fugitive . Ex-con . Escaped custody on a felony murder charge . That 's the other funny thing . It was your case . Andrew Goode murder . Mm-hmm . You interrogated him ? Yes , I did . Hours before he escaped ? That 's right . Guilty ? I never had a chance to prove it . Because he escaped . Only to turn up months later at the home of ... your employer . I know what you think . I know why you 're thinking it . I would think the same thing if I were in your shoes . I 'm not thinking anything yet , Mr. Ellison . I 'm just collecting information . How 's the girl ? She 's fine . She was , uh , just telling me about her friend , John Henry . The man with the cord in the back of his head in the basement of her mother 's work . Plugged into a big computer . And this is him . Oh , it gets better . She says that Mr. Ellison has been teaching it things . I destroyed that chip . You destroyed " a " chip . I don 't think it 's Cromartie . I think it 's something else . Something bigger . Something worse . It 's CyberDyne all over again . Why do they need the body ? The technology can be reverse engineered and used as a platform . Yeah , I know all that . But they 're not using it for the parts . They 're ... playing with it . I should have killed him . I 'm going to kill him . You 're not going to kill him . He can 't be trusted . No one can be trusted . But I only wanna kill him . No one 's going to be killed . No one 's going to be killed . Yes ? Catherine Weaver has agreed to meet . Great . When ? Where ? You give me the girl , the police go home . When it 's clear , I 'll bring you in . The girl can 't stay there . It 's not safe . That 's for her mother to decide . Done . We don 't kill just to kill . I never have . Look at these species ... They stay in hiding , mostly . And only attack when provoked . What does it eat ? Cuttlefish . Crustaceans . Other eels . Please don 't tap the glass . How long has Mr. Ellison worked for you ? A few months . You ever ask yourself why he didn 't stay with the F.B.I. ? No , I don 't . Are you aware he was arrested ? Murder . He was cleared of those charges . Did the two of you argue lately ? Had any tension ? Any reason he might want to harm you and your family ? Detective ... Are you suggesting Mr. Ellison ... may be complicit in the disappearance of my daughter ? Well , it wouldn 't be the first time we 've seen an employee try to blackmail their boss . Well , it would be the first time I had . This thing ... It eats other eels , huh ? That 's interesting . When you told me the security tapes were corrupted , you were lying to me for Mr. Ellison . And I 'm lying to him for you . What would happen if he knew ? Knew what ? That you aren 't Savannah 's mother ? That you aren 't anyone 's mother . Are you threatening me , John Henry ? I could tell Mr. Ellison . You could ... but that would be unfortunate . Mostly for Mr. Ellison . I find him useful , but not efficient . What if he fails ? Then we won 't see Savannah again . Mr. Ellison taught me ... that human life is sacred . Sacred ... that 's an interesting word . Comes from the Latin , Sacrum , much like another word ... sacrifice . Sacrifice . Perhaps it 's necessary to sacrifice Savannah for the greater good . The greater good is keeping you safe . In the elevator , you told Mr. Ellison ... that Savannah 's survival depended upon my survival . Yes , I did . But you didn 't say ... that my survival depended upon hers . It doesn 't . Ms. Weaver ... Yes ? There is a Bible story of two brothers , Cain and Abel . God favored Abel . Cain killed him . God cursed Cain and ordered him to wander the world alone . I 'm familiar with the story . Which brother am I ? I don 't know , John Henry . Perhaps you 're neither . Perhaps , in this story , you are God . I wanna tell you something . Yes ? It was not my idea to ditch you and Derek . I thought we were gonna meet you in the desert . And my mom took this detour off to Charley 's . I thought you knew . She had her reasons . She was pretty damn pissed at Derek about the whole Jesse thing . Who wasn 't ? I guess none of that matters now . You 'll miss him . Well ... There 's no use crying about it ... Is there ? I 'm sure future me would beat my ass if I did . Future you knows what it means to lose people you love . It happens to him too . Your mother ditched us because she was going to ditch you . She was going to leave you with Charley . No . No , that 's-that 's insane . She found a lump in her breast . Yeah , the transmitter , I know . She thought it was cancer . Well , she had a lump . It makes sense . She 's lost weight . What ? Get her up . We 've gotta go . Think he 'll come ? He 'll come . He could be deceiving us . He 's done it before . He wants the girl . He 'll be here . And what if he doesn 't come through ... with the meeting with Weaver ? We 're going into Zeira Corp with or without him . When we 're done , it 'll be ashes . She 's wrecking the town looking for you . Come on , I gotta get you out of here . No ! Take me out there , she 'll kill me ! She 's crazy ! Come on , Mr. Archer , we gotta get out of here ! You alone ? Yes . Where 's Savannah ? Row " J. " I 'll be in touch about the meeting . Put your hands behind your head . Kneel on the ground . John , I swear I didn 't know . I 'll kill you ! Let go of me ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill you . # I just got down from the Isle of Sky # # I 'm not very big , but I 'm awful shy # # The lassies shout as I walk by # # Donald , where 's your trousers ? # # Let the wind blow high , let the wind blow low # # Through the streets in my kilt I 'll go # # All the lassies cry , " Hello " # # Donald , where 's your trousers ? # # I went to a fancy ball # # It was slippery in the hall # # I was a-feared that I may fall # # ' Cause I nay had on trousers # # Let the wind blow high , let the wind blow low # # Through the streets in my kilt I 'll go # # All the lassies cry , " Hello " # # Donald , where 's your trousers ? # # The lassies love me , every one # # But they must catch me if they can # # You cannot put the breaks on a highland man # # Sayin ' , Donald , where 's your trousers ? # - # Let the wind blow high # - # Let the wind blow high # - # Let the wind blow low # - # Let the wind blow low # - # Through the streets # - # Through the streets # - # in my kilt , I 'll go # - # in my kilt , I 'll go # - # All the lassies cry , " Hello !

Cool " An Armenian Sentence " He 's a very hot-headed man . I learned Armenian . Armenian . The guy we 're meeting with , his name 's Sarkissian . That 's Armenian . Well , we 're not here to charm him . We 're here to get the turk and get out , simple . He said we should meet him at table 19 . Excuse me , I think we have some business to take care of . Oh , of course . Sorry . Table 19 . It 's right there . Keep the change . Remind me again . Why--why are the boys out here and the girls in there ? Because one of the boys is still wanted for murder , and one of the girls is ... harder than nuclear nails . And the other one 's a cyborg . You wanna know why we 're really here ? Why ? Moore 's law . Moore 's law . The guy who founded Intel said that every two years , the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles . 30 years ago , it was an observation . Now it 's a law . Tech industry spent billions doubling chip power . And ? And that 's how we can go from a chess computer to the apocalypse in just four years . I learned that a lot can happen in four years . A lot can happen in four seconds . One minute , I 'm in the yard with my brother , playing baseball , and the next , we look up , and the sky 's on fire . Judgment day . What 'd you do ? The only thing to do : took Kyle and went underground . What was he like ? He was just a kid when it happened . Eight years old . I was 15 . How do you tell an eight-year-old machines have taken over the world ? How do you ? You don 't . Maybe he 's at another table . I understand you 're interested in buying the turk . Yes 500,000 . Valley square mall , food court . Tomorrow 2.pm next to the ATM . Nice doing business with you . We don 't have $ 500,000 . Not yet . Mr. Dixen It 's been a So , what , eight years ? Mm , I see you 're a man of faith . Oh , no , my wife 's a catholic . It 's her mother 's . Do you know the story on the rapture , Mr. Dixon ? Like I said , my wife . Hmm . " and I heard , as it were , " the noise of thunder . " and I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , " ' come and see ' . " and I looked . " and behold , a pale horse . " and his name that sat on him was death . And hell followed with him . " The book of revelation . What is this ? I 've seen some things , Mr. Dixon . I 've seen some things with my own eyes , and heard ' em with my own ears . I 've beheld . And upon my beholding , I 've come to the conclusion , while new to me , might be old hat for you . What the hell are you talkin ' about ? Sarah Connor 's alive . And I think you know where she is . You 're crazy . If Sarah is alive , and I believe she is , we are working in the realm where much , perhaps anything , is possible . Robots ... Soldiers from the future , Skynet . If Sarah were alive , I 'm sure she 'd like to hear you say that . Co on , tell me what you know . I 'm gonna tell you ... What I told the other guy . I don 't know anything . The other guy ? The other agent you guys sent here . Kester . Kester ? Ooh ! Can I help you with something ... Bro ? That is a nice sword . Hey ... You don 't touch that . Family heirloom ? None of your business . You 're right . But this is my business . Shh , shh , shh . Do you know this woman ? I never seen her before in my life . Well , I 'll help you out . Her name 's Sarah Connor . I know that , because I read her FBI file . I told you . I don 't know her . Well , that 's ... Very interesting . Because your uncle Enrique knew her . He knew her pretty well , in fact . And you know what ? He 's in that file too . As one of the last known associates and an FBI informant ... You know what I think ? I think she went to him looking for identification . And I think he sent her to you . And I think , after she got what she wanted , she went back to Enrique . And I think she killed him . And now I have something she wants . So where is she ? " Los Ninos Heroes . " They were the six military cadets that died defending Chapultepec castle . Bright boys . Now , my friend ... how brave a boy are you ? I 'll handle this . What are you doing here ? I need to talk to you . Go home . Agent Ellison came into my house . And you turn around and come to mine ? I know , it 's okay . This is gonna be hard for you to imagine , but ... I think he 's ready to believe you . Believe me ? Charlie , this isn 't about believing me . If he believes you , he can protect you . Do you remember what you saw here ? What we destroyed ? Who destroyed it ? The FBI can 't protect us . You can 't protect us . If one of them follows you here , not the FBI ... One of them ... He 'll have killed us . So take your wife . Get as far away from here as you can . Forget me . Forget John Just Go Bright yellow tint . Grade M. ´ Slightly included . Shallow cut . You can 't just give a briefcase full of money to a guy like that and expect he 's just gonna and over the turk . Actually , I can . Well , those are from the safe house I set up , so , technically , they 're mine . Well , I 'm guessing you stole them , so technically , they 're evidence in a felony . What are we up to ? Current estimated value , $ 246,000 . You don 't even have enough . We 'll negotiate . We don 't even know what this guy looks like . We know what the turk looks like . I love these places . Food courts ? First day after me and the guys jumped through , we went to the Century City mall and we spent the whole day there . We all puked . You know , the funny thing , in the future , that place is a concentration camp . Is that it ? Where is he ? Son of a bitch stood us up again . We have to go . We came here for the turk . We can 't get it if we 're in prison . Sarah Connor . So nice to finally meet you . You know , a woman ... She calls my cell phone . She says she 's interesting in buying this ... Very special computer . Now , what do you do ? You just turn around and you just sell it ? Or , maybe ... You 're very beautiful . For a dead woman . Just let us pay you for the computer , and you 'll never hear from us again . If I was gonna sell you the turk , you 'd have had it by now . So this is my counter offer . The money you was gonna pay me for the turk , you take that number and you multiply it by four . $ 2 million ? You 're a fugitive , Ms. Connor . Might make that a small price for freedom . Here 's my counter offer . You tell us where the turk is , we keep our money , and I bury you in the back yard . Will you listen to me ? If I don 't walk out of here in ten minutes , my people are instructed to call the FBI and tell them everything I know . Your people ? Yeah . My people . Same people who are watching your son . He 's on a field trip , isn 't he ? With his class ? Science museum , I believe . Your people have no idea what they 're walking into . Derek . How long do we have to get the money ? You got 24 hours . Follow him . You haven 't spoken for 28 minutes . Well , it 's nothing . All right . My birthday 's tomorrow . Okay ? I know that mom totally forgot . Birthday ? Hey , you don 't know what a birthday is ? It 's the day you were born . Pretty memorable for a mother , right ? But it was 16 years ago . No , a birthday 's like a holiday . Like once a year , every year , people just kind of ... celebrate you , I guess . And you get presents and you eat cake and ... It 's fun . It 's supposed to be . Last year , mom got me a flak jacket . That 's a tight present . No . It 's not . Whatever ... Look , I don 't know why I care . I 've been driving since I was 12 , and , technically , this is my 24th birthday . It 's just I ... time-traveled over eight of them . Do I have a birthday ? I don 't know . Were you born ? I was built . Well , then , maybe you have like a build day . Hey , Cameron , listen to this . Hey , what do you have on there , man ? Hatful of hollow , man . Just downloaded it this morning . Dude , you gotta be kidding me . Cameron . Stay with the group , please . Sorry . Hey , Cameron . There you are . Your brother 's been looking for you . Oh , wow . Is this your car ? No , it belongs to the guy I killed and stuffed in the trunk . Hey ! Where you been ? Mom says we gotta get home right now . What 's up with the car ? Cameron stuffed a dead guy in the trunk . He was following us . Your sister 's dark , bro . You 're gonna love the Smiths . Yeah , she 's , uh , she 's really goth . Get in . Wait , Cameron . Hey , um ... There 's something I ... kind of need to ask you . Um , you think maybe you might wanna go to the prom with me ? Just say yes ! Yes ! Hey , Karen . Can you run a name for me ? I thought you knew everybody around here . Who you looking for ? Guy 's name is Kester . He 's an agent . Uh , it doesn 't ring a bell . Give me a sec . There we go . This the guy ? We 've been so swamped lately , it 's all I can do to keep this place organized . What file did you need ? File number 100-655371 . The Sarah Connor case . Looks like it 's checked out , my friend . To agent Ellison . James Ellison ? One and only . Thank you for your time . Oh , hold the elevator . He was a threat to us . Did he say anything ? A name , a location ? He said very little . And then he was quiet . I lost Sarkissian at the Cahuenga pass . Damn it . We have to find him . We have to get out of this house . No , we 're not moving . - He knows where we live , John . - I don 't care . We 're not running , not today . This house has a bull 's-eye painued on the front door . Do your thing . Hello ? Are you still watching those kids ? I got my eye on them right now . I think they have someone following me . No more games . Bring them back here . Here ? Where 's here ? Okay , so he 's expecting this guy to show up there any minute . And when he doesn 't , the first place he 's gonna come is here . Mom ... We can 't stay here , John . Not while he 's out there . It 's too risky . I 'm sorry . Wait here . Where is he ? Who ? Uhh ! He . Need I repeat ? John , go check the office . See if he stashed the turk in there . Can you get through the door ? Yes . But the wall would be much faster . What are you doing here ? Waiting for my daddy to finish work . Okay , listen . I need you to stay in this room with the door closed , okay ? Even if you hear loud noises or you get scared , you need to stay in here . Can you do that for me ? Yeah . Yeah ? Okay . Let him go . Not my kid . Not mine either . Are you okay ? John ... Let 's go back inside . Is that your daddy out there in the alley ? No . My daddy went to the café . You know how to get back there from here ? You go find your daddy . Don 't look back , just go . Sarkissian 's hard drive . Do I need to kill you now ? Kester . Yeah , that 's what he likes to call himself when he 's out trick-or-treating in his FBI costume . George Lazlo 's a better actor than we thought . That 's not Lazlo . James , are we looking at the same picture here ? This is your guy . It 's Lazlo . The blood doesn 't match . Come on , what are you saying ? That this guy somehow killed six people and then found a plastic surgeon who made him look identical to George Lazlo ? And then what ? Killed Lazlo , stole his identity , and then ... put himself in the FBI database as this guy Kester ? To what end ? What 's the goal here ? Who is he ? What is he ? What is he ? Yeah . What is he ? What is he , that ... stands across from a man after killing two other men within 36 hours ... and when asked of his involvement , cannot only lie , but lie well ? And not only lie well , but not blink or twitch or perform one simple human reaction to the situation . So , yes ... I think it 's fair to ask : what is he ? You know as well as I some men are monsters . Yeah . Monsters . Let 's go get him . Mom ... Sorry . Look , he double-encrypted the drive . I 've unlocked a lot of it , but there 's still a lot left to go through . How much ? That 's about 1,000 useful files . Each one takes about five minutes to decrypt . And I 'm on number 37 . You do the math . Let me know when you have something . How are you holding up ? I 'm all right . So it 's your birthday . Yeah , how 'd you know ? You kidding ? I celebrated your 30th with you . How was that ? You got drunk as a skunk . Come on . I 'll buy you a beer . I 'm 16 . All right , I 'll buy you an ice cream cone . Come on . It 's your birthday . When there are things to celebrate , they should be celebrated . Let 's go . Your mom has never killed anyone , has she ? You know , she 's got murder in her eyes all the time , but her heart 's pure . It 's a good thing , you know . Keep a- - keep a pure heart . It 's beautiful here , isn 't it ? You know , you stay long enough , you start fooling yourself into thinking that this is ... How it 's always gonna be . And you remember what this place 'll look like when it 's on fire , and ... you realize you 'll do whatever it takes to keep from watching it burn again . Is that ... you ? And the younger one , is that ... Kyle . Throws pretty good for a five-year-old , huh ? Your father always had a nice arm . How 'd you know ? Every time I look at you , I see him . Besides , your mom 's his type . Happy Birthday ! FBI raid in North Hollywood . Suspect considered armed and extremely dangerous . May be posing as an FBI agent . Last name Kester . In ' Lord of the Flies ' , a group of boys slaughter a pig in the jungle . They torture it and place its head on a sharpened stake as an offering to the beast that hovers , god-like , above the island . Black blood drips down the pig 's teeth . And the boys run away . Later , when one of the boys is alone , he weeps . But not for the pig . The boy weeps for the end of innocence and the darkness of men 's hearts . Have you seen Derek ? No . He 's , uh , still at the park , I think . And what were you two doing ? Nothing . Uh , we just went to get an ice cream . Here . Check these out . Looks like you weren 't the only one looking for the turk . Who 's this ? I 'm not sure . But he came in after Dimitri and before you . Enough time for sarkissian to sell him the turk . It 's not much to go on , but it 's something . Why don 't you take a break ? No , no , it 's all right . I can keep going . How are we supposed to celebrate your birthday if you 're sitting in front of a computer ? You actually thought I forgot your birthday ? It 's just we have much more important things to think about than my stupid birthday . Your birthday is important . No , it 's not important . Finding the turk , stopping Skynet , judgment day- - that 's important , that 's ... That 's our life . It 's our mission . This is our life . If we stop caring about that , then we 're lost . Well , when you put it like that ... I sent Cameron to get a cake . What do you want for dinner ? Well , not to insult your cooking or anything , but do you mind if we went out ? Yeah , we can do that . All right , let me shut this down . What ? What 's the matter ? The guy that Derek killed ... in the alley . Sarkissian . I don 't think that was Sarkissian .

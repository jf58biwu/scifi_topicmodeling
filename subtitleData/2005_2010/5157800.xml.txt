The Merino , the Romney , the Drysdale- - these names are whispered in the winds that caress the rugged hills . These names are shared in corners of the farmyard , and these are the names the young men of the land recite as they take themselves off at night . But in the future , they will whisper just one name ... the Oldfield . Now you take it down and lead it round in front of the guests . That 's it . Stop so they can touch it , slap a flank , feel the wool . I 'll take the other microphone , give it to anyone else who ... has a question .

That 's it , then . You got rid of all Dad 's things . Living in the past- - that 's what 's wrong with these bloody farmers . You 're now the owner of the biggest farm in the district . What does that make you ? Up here 's where the smart farming 's done these days , Henry . is that what all that outside 's in aid of ? People are interested in what I 'm doing here , Henry . It 's a whole new approach to farming . It 's better for the animals , better for the farmers , better for the consumer . It 's an exciting time to be in agricultural sciences . And a profitable one . ( moaning ) More tea , Henry ? I think three 's enough . I should get going . That 's a pity . You 'll miss my rabbit pie . I 'm making watercress for the Japanese . Look , chopsticks . He 's quite the lord of the manor now , isn 't he ? Uh ... Angus was throwing this away . I know your father would have wanted you to have it . The Golden Shears . Best shearer in the country three years running . Your father said you were a natural too . l- - l really can 't see it on my coffee table . You got what you came for then ? Angus has got his deal . Guess I 'm done here . I 'm having the farm manager take you for a run up to the top . But I haven 't been up there since the accident . I know . That 's why you 're going . Oh , here he is now . - Kia ora , Auntie . - Henry : Tucker . ( bleats ) ( bleating ) ( sniffing ) ( growls ) Flash threads , bro . So you a model now or something ? I 'm doing l.T. Internet stuff . Oh . Nude modeling . ( laughs ) And you 're manager now ? Well , your brother 's hardly young farmer of the year , is he ? Angus seems to think he 's got a handle on things . The only thing he 's got a handle on is his- - ( brakes screech ) ( honking ) Okay , farm boy , let 's see your stuff . Sure . Okay . Come on . Yah ! What happened to you , darling ? Give us a hand , bro ! l- - l just need to make a phone call . Jesus , man . Just gonna shove her back over the fence . ( dialing ) ( Henry moans ) Hey ! - Tucker : Hands up ? - Hands up ! ( whimpering ) It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'll protect you . ( crunches ) Girl : Grant ! Grant ? is this gonna take long ? Because I 've got a taxi waiting . If you fascists have hurt him , I will organize the biggest sit-in this farm has ever seen . Look , we don 't know where your friend is , okay ? - Maybe my brother could help ? - Brother ? Angus Oldfield . I should have known you were an Oldfield . I can see it in your aura . I think that was just something he stepped in back there , eh ? - No , you have a very selfish aura . - What ? How would you like a taste of what you 're dishing out ? Safety 's on . - What ? - The safety 's on . Just ... yeah , on the other side . Back a bit . And down . Back and down . Up .

Because- - Smoke . ( dog barks ) - You coming ? - Um ... Mike ? Mike ! Oh my God . What ? The feng shui in this room is terrible . ( rustling ) Anyone there ? Mike ? ( hooves clopping ) Oh God . ( snarls ) Jesus , man , it 's not gonna bite . - What 's it doing ? - What is wrong with you ? - Ovinophobia , my therapist calls it . - What 's that ? Just a completely unfounded and irrational fear that one day this is gonna happen ! ( bleating ) Well , this happens when you run the most reckless genetic engineering program in the southern hemisphere . - Who engineered that ? - Your brother . ( sheep banging ) ( screams ) Mike . - ( bleating ) - ( Experience screams ) Come on then , muttonchops ! Bugger me . ( groans ) - ( bleats ) - Shoot it again ! That 'll give you something to talk to your therapist about . Experience : Oh , I 'm going to be sick ! ( sheep bleating ) Oh shit . Oh shit . Kia ora . Kia ora , kia ora . Rattle your dags , Henry ! There we go . Good girls . They 're fine . Tucker : You get Henry. I 'll start the car . God , your chi is in shambles . Huh ? Take a deep breath . You need to ground yourself . You 're a tree . Come on . A tree . Your taproot extends down into the earth . My- - my what ? That 's your base chakra . Feel the energy drawing out of the soil . Can you feel it ? Yeah . - Really ? - Yeah . Come on , Henry . The energy flows up into your navel chakra , your solar plexus chakra , into your heart chakra . It spreads to your branches , your twigs , your leaves . You are a mighty kauri commanding the forest . Look with your third eye . Totally relaxed . Totally relaxed . - ( honking ) - Get on the fucking truck ! - ( engine starts ) - Nearly there , nearly there . - ( snarls ) - ( gasps ) Go ! Go go go ! Watch out for the sheep ! Shoot ! Sorry . - ( grunts ) - What the hell 's he doing ? ( groaning ) Chainsaw . ( motor sputtering ) ls it turned on ? ( groans ) - Prime it , prime it ! - What ? The pump thing . - ( motor starts ) - ( screams ) ( honking horn ) Fuck ! Oi , Henry ! - Are you okay ? - lf it weren 't for my gumboot ... Who 's driving ? - Jump ! - Both : What ? Jump off , now ! Jump off ! Ah ! ( bleats ) ( bleating ) Oh , shit . Experience : Wow , what a beautiful view . - This is , uh , where- - - l know . This is what ? Ooh , long way down . I wouldn 't want to fall off there . This is where my father fell to his death . Oh . Sorry ... to hear that . Oh , a sheep ! is that a good one or a bad one ? ( farts ) Oh , definitely bad . That 's not funny . Animal flatulence is responsible for almost half the world 's greenhouse gas emissions . It 's pure methane . The Kyoto Protocol- - Kyahhh ! What do we do ? Well , reducing carbon emission from industries- - No , what do we do about raising the alarm ? My phone ... is in the truck . Tucker , what do you think ? Hoof it for the house . Tell his lordship what 's going on . is it far ? It 's rough terrain , open paddocks , hot day , no cover . Yeah , I 'd say it 's pretty far . With about 50,000 sheep in between . Then what ? Then I get as far away from here as I can . You 're still leaving ? I 'm especially leaving . Experience : Oh , what if the sheep get down there before us ? Then Angus is gonna have some unexpected visitors . ( snoring ) Henry . Well ? No sign of him . The others have gone out into the paddocks . You cannot make a cup of tea in this country without some do-gooder starting a petition to have you do it their way . You help me in the lab . And you , get rid of that stuff . ( barking ) Bloody animals . - ( growling ) - ( screams ) ( sniffing ) ( honking ) You and your- - your bloody 4-wheel drives . Think you own the road ! I do , actually . Angus Oldfield . What hole did you crawl out of ? WEKA . The Whole Earth Kollective Aotearoa . I know all about your Frankensheep ! Mother Nature spent millions of years making sheep . She doesn 't need your help ! Don 't talk to me about nature . Man made sheep what they are today , and I 'm making them what they 'll be tomorrow . If I was a sheep , I wouldn 't be anywhere near you ! If you were a sheep , I 'd have you ground up for dog food , you little worm . Now get the fuck off my land . - ( growling ) - Ahh ! Henry : They might come from anywhere . And they might not . Calm down , bro . So this guy you 're looking for , is he your boyfriend ? - My boyfriend ? - Yeah . - ls he your boyfriend ? - Grant 's part of our collective . We 're a non-profit cooperative that shares information and resources about environmental issues . So what were you and your boyfriend doing here today ? We keep hearing about some cowboy lab that 's flushing every animal research guideline down the toilet . Scum like Astrid Rush and your brother need to answer to somebody sometime . For someone who likes animals , you don 't like people very much , do you ? I would have thought that you of all people would appreciate efforts to deconstruct the colonialist paternalistic agrarian hierarchy that disenfranchises the Tangata Whenua and erodes the natural resources of Aotearoa . Learn all that at university , did ya , before you dropped out ? I didn 't drop out , thank you . I just missed exams while we were occupying a poultry farm . Anyway , that 's none of your business . - ( groans ) - Henry : Are you okay ? Rescue Remedy ? I don 't need rescuing . I need Dettol and a sticking plaster . No thanks . Fine , suit yourself . Henry : Wait , we should stick together . Tucker , I 'm sorry . It 's my fault you got bitten . Don 't worry . It 'll be- - oh fuck ! I 'll get a tetanus shot when we get back . - Clear it right up . - But the sheep did that . Then I 'll get the vet to have a look at it. lt 'll be fine . ( bleating ) Oh God . Here they come . - Don 't wait for me ! - l 'm not leaving you behind . - What about the sheep ? - Well , fuck the sheep ! No time for that , bro ! Go go go ! ( panting ) - ln here . - Not in there . Why not ? It 's been here forever. lt 's empty . - No it 's not , bro . - This is your brother 's laboratory . ( barks ) You got a better idea ? Go home . Get , go on ! - ( barks ) - Henry : Come on . ( lock clicks ) Did you know about this ? I just thought they were playing with sperm or something . ( beating ) Oh God . ( growls ) Stand back ! Do it . Tucker ? Jesus , Henry , are you gonna shoot me if I end up like that ? - You 're trespassing . - Taihoa , Bo Peep . What is this ? I told you . agricultural science . This isn 't science . The sheep are revolting . Aren 't they ? - Now , Henry ... - Hey hey . I 'll take that as your resignation . Angus , what would Dad say about all this ? He wouldn 't say anything . He 'd be knee-deep in mud with his hand up a sheep 's ass . Your father was 10 times the farmer you are . My father fell off a cliff chasing a wool-blind ewe . Angus , there 's something wrong with the sheep . They attacked us . Oh nonsense . Your brother 's clearly one of these lunatic greenies . Tucker , show them your foot . Foot ? Henry , I simply won 't allow you to disrupt things today . What are you going to do about it , eh ? ( Tucker groaning ) Whatever I have to . Angus , are you nuts ? There 's a lot riding on this , Henry. I told you , it 's gonna be very profitable . ( groaning ) Henry , get out of here . Do something ! Get out of here ! - What ? - Move your ass ! - ( whimpering ) - Henry , come on ! Stop ! ( bleating ) This way ! ( Experience groans ) ln there ! Oh , what 's down here ? Look at them , Angus ! Look at you . The fifth generation farmer 's son who 's scared of a few sheep . You do need therapy . Ah ! There 's no deal , Angus . We have a contract , Henry . It 's done . Not with all this going on . ( bleating ) - Ah ! - Henry ! Help me ! Help me , Angus ! Angus ! I 'm your brother ! That 's the thing about farms , Henry , accidents happen . - Let me go . - No . No . ( both shout ) ( both grunt ) ( panting , coughing ) Oh my God ! - Are you okay ? - l 'll never be okay ever again . - ( groans ) - ( zipper unzips ) ( lighter strikes ) - What 's that ? - Geranium- - aroma therapy for uplift and hormonal balance . Do your hormones really need balancing ? Considering I 've been attacked by genetically - engineered monsters , jumped off a moving vehicle , been chased across a paddock , dragged into a torture chamber , pulled into a mountain of rotting flesh- - yes , my hormones need fucking balancing . - Working yet ? - Uplifting at any moment . - Where are you going ? - There are caves near the woolshed . If this is part of the same system , we can walk right under the sheep . Right . ( sniffing ) All he had to do was leave . Why wouldn 't he do that ? What happened to those idiots I sent to collect you ? That looks ... anomalous . What it looks like is the spontaneous cellular transferral we 've been trying to achieve for months . Or possibly not so spontaneous . - What 's going on ? - Nothing . He 'll be out for a while . Where 's your brother and that girl ? Oh , don 't worry . They 're gone . Well , I don 't know what they 're on about . The sheep ? Really . There 's too many people running around here today . One of those greenies bit me on my way up the hill . - Bit you ? - Yeah . Looked like he hadn 't bathed for months . Hm , you may need a shot . Well . I want this place secured . Yeah , I have something I need to observe here , but I 'll be down presently . No . Stay here . Stay here ? I need to present my work . Look , the last thing I need is someone with your reputation prancing about the place . Oh , my reputation didn 't seem to bother you when you needed someone to kick-start this venture . Or when you wanted to pursue some personal interests . ( bleats ) I was just coming up with solutions that you hadn 't thought of . Now I 'll send someone up for the animal . You lock this place down and stay out of the way . What about that shot ? Put a plaster on it . I 'm sure you 'll be fine . The amount of bad karma your brother 's generating , he 'll probably come back as a sheep . I don 't want to think about what Angus has been doing . Using your father 's legacy as a testing ground for vile experiments on animals . Experience . What was all that about a deal ? Huh ? What are you here for today ? I sold him my share of the farm . I thought if I could come back here and resolve things with him , I could move on . But these are your roots . ( lighter strikes ) There 's something in here . There can 't be . Or they 'd have to ... - ( bleating , thumps ) - jump ! Come on ! Shit ! I have to get out of here ! - Down here . - No . No way . If it 's a way out , we 're there . If it 's not , we 're there forever . ( bleating ) You go first ! Henry : It shouldn 't be too far . Keep moving . I can 't . You can . Look , you 're a tree . - A tree . - Feel your roots - in the ground . Feel your , um ... - Chakra . - ... chakra ... - My base chakra . ... drawing energy from the ground . Okay , I feel it . There . You 're relaxed . I 'm relaxed . - ( farts ) - Don 't get too relaxed . ( growling ) Go ! Go ! - Hurry up ! - l 'm hurrying ! ( Henry grunts ) - Don 't stop ! - lt 's opening up ! - ( growling ) - ( Henry grunts ) I 'm stuck ! ( bleating ) - ( squealing ) - ( fire roaring ) I was wrong about your aura . Really ? I said it was selfish , but ... now I think it was something you stepped in . ( chuckles ) This way . Mrs. Mac : " Address To A Haggis : Fair fa ' your honest , sonsie face , Great chieftain o the pudding-race ! Aboon them a ' ye take your place , Painch tripe or thairm . " - Oh hello , dear . - ( gasps ) Did you see Henry up the hill ? Uh , no . No , I think he 's gone . Oh ? Really ? I thought he would have at least said goodbye . Well ... you can 't tell what Henry will do , can you ? It 's all his bloody fault . He had his money- - good money . My money . That little baaa-stard . Henry : Up here . This is how I remember it . It 's beautiful . We 'd better hurry . ( water running ) ( nozzle squeaks ) ( light buzzing ) What 's that noise ? Somebody shearing . ( animal panting ) - ( shears buzzing ) - ( panting ) Experience : Hello ? ( growling ) Oh God , no . ( sniffing ) Grant ? - ( growling ) - Oh ! ( gasps ) What 's happened to you ? Grant , it 's me- - Experience . - Hey ! - ( shears buzzing ) ( roaring ) Experience : Henry ! - ( Grant roaring ) - This way ! Come on ! Henry : Round here . - He 's coming ! - Come on . Oh shit ! Grant , what 's that on your face ? is that blood ? ( grunts ) Have you been eating meat , Grant ? Was it even organic ? ( burps ) So , that 's your boyfriend ? I knew you liked animals , but I didn 't think you ... He 's not my boyfriend . Something must have bitten him . You mean ... like Tucker ? The amniotic fluid should work as an attenuated vaccine on the mutated cells . What 's going on ? - Tell me how you feel ? - Sore . ltchy . My- - my skin feels really tight . - Go on . - ( growls ) No no no no no no no no . No , wait . ( groaning ) ( people chatting ) All right , thanks very much . Oh hello . Thanks for coming . Konnichiwa . Angus : We 're about to kick off . There 's my girl . ( breathing heavy ) - ( growls ) - ( screams ) ( growling ) - ( screams ) - ( laughs ) Oh shit ! Angus won 't be selling much sheep if he turns into one , will he ? He might need that shot after all . You 're a very lucky young man , to be witness to a new scientific frontier . I have a small errand to attend to , and then ... I think we might try and replicate the effect on you with some of these cultures I have . In the meantime , you rest up . ( footsteps recede ) ( microphone feedback ) ( microphone feedback ) Konnichiwa , güten tag , kia ora , g 'day . This land was carved from virgin bush by my great-great grandfather more than ... 100 years ago . My family have sowed their seed here since that time . But now ... I have a dream for the future- - - a dream of sheep . - ( sheep bleats ) ( chuckles ) ( bleats ) Oh . The Merino , the Romney , the Drysdale . Excuse me . ( panting ) ( bleating ) lt 's not far . It 's just a quick trip through the trees . ( bleating ) ( bleating ) ( Rush screaming ) These names are shared in corners of the farm- - ( bleating ) These- - these names are ... - names ... - ( bleating ) ( murmuring ) Well , time to meet the star of our show , I suppose . I give you the Oldfield . Man : It 's beautiful . ( applause ) ( bleats ) - Quiet down . - ( bleating ) ( whispering ) Ah , beautiful . ( bleating continues ) ( audience laughing ) Quiet now . Quiet , my pretty . ( low rumbling ) Oh no . ( people screaming ) Perhaps it won 't be that bad . ( screaming ) Easy ! Easy ! Easy ! ( woman screaming ) Oh ! ( gurgling ) " Lo , on Mount Zion stood the lamb , and with him , 144,000 . " ( gasping ) ( man screaming in Japanese ) ( sniffing ) ( bleating ) ( screaming ) Woman : But I 'm a vegetarian ! Was , was , was ! " lt is these who follow the lamb wherever he goes , for they are spotless ! " - Help me ! Help me ! - Ew ! Get off ! Help me ! ( both speaking German ) ( screams ) Take me up , O Lord ! Take me ... ( honks ) Henry ! Just in time for dinner ! - Oh my Lord ! - ( screaming ) Oh ! ( bleats ) ( laughing ) Yeah ! Angus : Easy , easy . That 's my girl . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay. lt 's okay . There , it 's- - l know . It 's okay , yes . I know , it 's okay . Let 's make that phone call . I think MAF , then WEKA . Or WEKA then MAF . Someone must have one of the other phones off the hook . - Who else is in the- - - ( growling ) - Your boyfriend 's back . - Experience : Jesus , Grant . - Henry ! - Ow ! Mrs. Mac : My shotgun 's in the pantry ! Many 's the meal I 've made of wethers like you . - You don 't scare me . - ( roars ) - What is that ? - ( grunts ) - My haggis ! - ( slurping ) Shells ! ( howling ) Shells ! No ! What did you do ? Ling gui ba fa . - Huh ? - Acupuncture point . Causes temporary paralysis . Or coma if I did it wrong . Did you ? He fell down , didn 't he ? ( sheep bleating ) ( Experience struggling ) We 're safe . We 're trapped . Let 's make that call . Where 's the other phone ? Uh , Angus 's study . - Locked ! - Here we are . Angus : You 're alive . I pulled it from the wall . What ? I thought , just keep a lid on things till it all blows over . Business community don 't receive this kind of situation very well . They probably won 't receive being eaten very well eith- - What are you doing in here ? You wouldn 't understand . I understand you 've got a pretty fucked up idea of animal husbandry . I 'm taking back the farm . Ah . Golden boy thinks he can do better , does he ? You wouldn 't know where to start . Jeez , Angus , I couldn 't do any worse than you . No , wait . It 's ... one of us . It 's family . What ? That 's how we made the advances- - human DNA . Mine . Ours . You fucker . Well , it was more of a sperm sample really . You wanker ! Necessity 's the mother of invention . You 've been bitten . It 's nothing . Just some hippy . You 'll become one of them ! - A hippy ? - No , Angus , one of them . Only worse . What are you gonna do , Henry ? Kill me ? - l 'm your brother . - ( banging ) Experience : They 're almost in ! Mrs. Mac : Upstairs , children ! Well ? The sheep are breaking in . They 'll tear you to pieces . Oh , I don 't think so . Experience : Henry , hurry ! Goodbye , Angus . ( sheep bleating ) Experience : Henry ! Come on , now !

His plane . He can 't leave if he 's contaminated . It could affect the whole country . Mrs. Mac : You 're hurt , dear . Grant . We don 't know what will happen . - We 've seen what happens ! - Stay calm . You 're a tree . I 'm not a tree ! I 'm a fucking sheep . No , you 're a man . And your father 'd be proud of you . Come on . You two go . I 'm staying here . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna stop Angus . If you see me again , you might have to- - No . I still smell , right ? No , that 's just your aura . How will you get across the lawn ? You don 't have a hoof like Angus , they 'll tear you to bits . I 'll blend in . ( whispering ) I am a sheep. I am a sheep . ( sheep growls ) ( howls ) I am a sheep . Wait . You go to town . Show me how to use this and I 'll stay here . Have you ever fired a gun before , dear ? Well ... not as such . Aim and squeeze , dearie . That 's all there is to it . Besides ... I 'll talk you through it .

We could have run the farm together , if you hadn 't ruined everything ! If you hadn 't tried to kill me ! Now it has to end . ( screams ) ( howling ) ( panting ) ( roaring ) What ?

( growls ) ( honking ) ( screech ) ( grunts ) Tucker . You 're okay . Oh ! What is that ? Just a little something I picked up in the lab . Should clear up your worms . Fix your fly strike too . Anyway , pull your finger out . We 've got work to do . - ( whistling ) - ( barking ) Hold ' em , Dice . Hold ' em . Good dog . ( barking ) How much of that stuff is there ?

Organic farming ? Nothing but trouble , this modern stuff . Better just to stick with the way we 've always done things , eh ? ( whimpering ) ( crying ) ( sobbing ) I 've eaten a rabbit . Mrs. Mac : Blanket , dear ? Let 's see how we go , eh ? ( sobbing ) Snack ? - What are they ? - Mountain oysters . Well , I do eat a bit of seafood . No . Mm , it 's good . Of course it is , dear .

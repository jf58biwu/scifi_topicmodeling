 Forgive me , father , for I have sinned . It 's been three months since I 've confessed . Go on , my son . Do ... Do you believe that God can speak to you , Father ? Od course I do . The Lord speaks to all those who are willing to listen . What about the Devil , then ? Do you , want to confess something , my son ? I 'm a good man , Father . I ... I try to be a good man . But I ... I see things . I s- - see things . I don 't know why he chose me , but it 's happening again . It 's happening again , and I 'm scared . Scared of what ? Of what 's going to happen on the bus . I want it to stop . Please ! I just want it to stop . Son , have you hurt someone ? Son . Son , come back . Roy ! I know it 's you . Hey , let 's go buddy , what 's the problem ? Oh , my God ! Fringe S01E03 : " The Ghost Network " The souls of the just are in the hand of God . And no torment shall touch them . They seemed , in the view of the foolish ... To be dead . And their passing away was thought an affliction . And their going forth from us , utter destruction . But they are in peace . You know , you being here , Libby ... You did the right thing . Yeah . The man betrays his country , turning over state secrets to God knows who . And here we are , pretending he 's a hero . I know . Stop ! Bureau 's got one black eye as it is . The last thing we need right now is another espionage scandal . You made it through . It 's over now . Did you see John 's mother ? She wouldn 't stop looking at me . His mother . Yeah , like she was , blaming me for what happened to him . Like it was my fault he was dead . As far as John 's mother knows , her son died a hero serving ' his country . A hero . He used me , Charlie . And he told me he loved me . I wasn 't gonna tell you this , but he said he loved me too . Agent Dunham . Agent Francis . I need you to come with me . Thank you ! You brought your own sweetener ? Don 't be ridiculous . It 's my medication . You 're not on any medication , Walter . Of course I am . I been making it myself in the lab . Oh , I wish you were joking . You 're self-medicating . With homemade drugs . Simple combination of dextromethorphan , clonazepam , and some fluoxetine . Those are psychotics , Walter . All of them . Of course they are . That 's the point . I have been in a mental facility for the past 17 years . It 's put me quite out of balance . Stay here for a second , would you ? What if I need to use the bathroom ? Just hold it . I 'll be right back . Hello . Hey , hey ! What you doin ' ? What , you thought I didn 't see you all day ? You were supposed to check in before you came home . If you tell anybody else that I 'm here , you 're the first one of the bunch I 'm gonna come after . It was moving . But I stopped it . There was something important . I 've decided on the pancakes . Blueberry . That 's great , Walter . Did somebody call me on the phone ? That 's what was important . Something about a bus . The incident occurred at 8 : 14 AM , middle of Rush Hour . First responders were worried it was bioterrorism . Ghosts of the Sarin Subway incident in Tokyo in 1995 . They called in the CDC ... Confirmed the attack isn 't biological in nature . There 's no contingent . And you said there wasn 't any good news . Excuse me . A team 's coming in to transfer this bus to a secure area . I want you to extend the perimeter outside the tunnel another 50 yards . It 's horrible . They 're like mosquitoes trapped in amber . If this was some sort of attack , why not just use something conventional , like plastic explosives ? A pipe bomb ? Impact . Whoever did this wanted attention . I mean , look at that . Or it 's not an attack at all . And it 's something else entirely . Meaning what ? If I knew that , you wouldn 't be here . I imagine that the material was released in gaseous form before solidification . I need to study it back in my lab . Can I have some ? We 'll have to dig out their personal effects so we can ID them . Notify their next of kin . It 's not here . In eius telephoni non fuit . Quomodo pergemus ? Roy ? What is that ? I don 't know . Any idea what it is yet ? Tricky , very tricky . All I 've been able to discern is that it starts as a silicon-based aerosol , and it solidifies somehow . You could be of assistance to me . I would love to hear some Bach . Mass in A Minor . Will you play it for me ? I 'm sure the young lady down there would get us a piano . That young lady is an FBI agent , Walter . Her name is Astrid , and this is the 100th time you have forgotten her name . So , no . I don 't think I can get you a piano . You always resisted your lessons too . Lack of commitment , son . Was always your problem . Imagine that 's why you still haven 't chosen a profession . I suppose I should 've followed in your footsteps 'cause your work has obviously brought such joy to the world . Who was he , Peter ? Sorry ? The man in the restaurant . You in some kind of trouble ? It was nothing . He was harassing the waitress . I just told him to cut it out . Oh , I see . Excuse me . Can you please extract this camera ? I want you to note all the people on this video . Cross-check them with the victims . If we 're lucky , maybe she caught whoever did ... Stop ! Go back . Can you close in on that woman ? What is it ? That backpack . I just saw that woman , that backpack wasn 't there . Has anyone seen a blue backpack with the other personal effects ? So someone took the bag from her ? Got off the bus before the attack ? Who is she ? Evelina Mendoza . She 's a federal employee . What 's her job ? Oh , my God ! She 's DEA . The woman who died on the bus , whose backpack was stolen , she was a Drug Enforcement Agent , undercover . She had a handler , Grant Davidson . I wanna bring him in for questioning . I apologize if I wasn 't helpful on the phone . I needed to ask my superiors ... For clearance to talk to you about Eve . Our condolences . From her records she seemed like an exemplary agent . Ah , she was . Can you tell us about the case she was working on ? Uh , three months ago she was tasked to infiltrate the East Coast representatives of a Nicaraguan drug cartel . We 'd been bangin ' on them for over a year . She called me . Said she wanted me to pull her out . She was scared . Said she heard members of the cartel discussing something about the pattern . I told her I never heard of it . And , uh , we set up a meet but she never showed . It appears whoever attacked the bus this morning was interested in one of her effects . Do you have any idea what she could 've been carrying ? I wish I could be more helpful . You have been , Agent Davidson . Thank you . Uh , I 've been asked to officially ID her body . I suppose that won 't be a problem . Have you spoken with her family ? Uh , there 's a brother she doesn 't talk to . I didn 't realize how hard this was gonna be . You don 't have to explain . I know what it 's like to lose someone you 've worked with closely . I 'd uh ... I 'd like to say good-bye . Of course . Should I bother to ask ? Music helps him process . It works too . As soon as Peter started playing , Walter just kinda locked in . He was able to recreate the material from the crime scene . Hey ! I hear you play the piano . He doesn 't just play . He 's good . You should hear him . No , maybe some other time . Olivia . You 'll be pleased to hear we figured it out . The material , the gas that was released on the bus , turned solid when it met the nitrogen in the atmosphere . Instantly immobilizing and suffocating the passengers . So who would have the know-how to manufacture something like this ? I 'll give you six guesses . And the first five don 't count . Massive Dynamic . Three chemical companies in the US supply those compounds . All of them fully-owned subsidiaries of Massive Dynamic . Charlie ? What 's up ? We 've got something . I think you 're gonna wanna see it . Tip got called in from a priest over at St. Anne 's . Says the guy that lives here mentioned a potential incident about the bus ... Before it happened . So what do we know about him ? Name 's Roy McComb . High school graduate . No criminal record . Apparently he 's been pushing papers for the last couple of months . Got DPD picking him up from there right now . That doesn 't seem like the profile of a mass-murderer . No . I didn 't think so either . What ? You 're looking at depictions of dozens of attacks , accidents , disasters , we 've seen over the last year . And look , all of them are dated before the incidents took place . Was that the flight from Hamburg ? Hey , you wanna see everything from 1989 . No . Perhaps ' 79 . Fantastic ! That 's very helpful . Oh , stop ! I was right . Belly and I worked on this very problem . - Belly ? - Yeah . As in William Bell . Founder of Massive Dynamic and one of the richest men on the planet . He and Walter used to share a lab together . Loved cloves . Awful odor . We posited a spectrum of waves lying outside of the range of those already discovered . We hypothesized that these waves could be used to communicate information . The government , of course , was extremely interested . It was a brilliant idea . A theory , but a good one . They wanted to use the network to send their most clandestine information . Because if no other government knew the spectrum existed , they couldn 't listen in . Yes . And they called it the " Ghost Network " . But they asked us to take it one step further , to develop a method where they could transmit directly from one person to another . I surmised that I could introduce an iridium-based , organometallic compound into the subject 's brain . You have got to be kidding me . What ? Roy McComb was one of your test subjects . Of course . Yes ! That explains it , doesn 't it ? Explains it ? Yes , that explains why he almost died today . Because you injected something into his brain nearly 20 years ago . No , what I gave him was not nearly enough to cause that reaction . The compound must have multiplied in his bloodstream over time . Environment , perhaps diet . He was a sophomore , volunteering for psych experiments . Did you ever even bother to explain to him what you were doing ? Well it wouldn 't have been a very secret experiment if I had . What 's going on ? How 's Roy McComb ? Roy McComb will be fine . No thanks to my father 's attempts to turn him into a human walkie-talkie . Wait a second . Don 't you try and change the subject ! What you just said is on subject . The iridium-based compound that multiplied in his bloodstream has turned him into some kind of receiver . - A receiver of what ? - Transmissions . Someone else , it seems , and I 'm somewhat jealous of this , has perfected our Ghost Network . And is using it to communicate . Our dear Roy is merely overhearing what they say . You will note that the Rotary Movement gives the impression of a three-dimensional tunnel , when in fact it is not . Next slide , please . Ah , it 's an oldie but a goodie . As you observe this image , your brain perceives first a duck , then a rabbit , then a duck again and always comes back to the duck . In truth , the image is neither . But it illustrates the brain 's need to take random sensory input and construct it - into a meaningful whole , despite- - - Great . Thank you ! Forget it . Uh , I 'm sorry , I don 't think I do get it . Well , neither do I. I just want him to stop . I 'll get the lights . I suspect someone has continued my research . But they 've taken the easy way out . Merely using the Ghost Network as a secure telecommunications channel . You 're suggesting that Roy 's listening in to someone 's telephone network . Yes . But no , not listening . Roy 's brain is trying to interpret the sensory input . Much as our brains grapple with the duck rabbit , I told you . It always comes back to the duck . So if Roy 's receiving this frequency , is there any way that we can tap in and hear them ? Or , maybe even ID them ? Construct a receiver using that spectrum , it 's possible , of course . But it would take months . But it may be possible to redirect the transmissions from his visual centers to his auditory cortex . Wait , you want to rewire his brain ? Not without his permission . It would be a minor surgery . Minor brain surgery . Emphasis not on the minor . I would need a specific piece of equipment . Magnetic neurostimulator I built in 1983 . With a few adjustments , it would work . All right . We 'll just go back in time and get it for you . No need to . It 's most likely where I left it 17 years ago . Hidden in a wall in our old house in Cambridge . Blast from the past . What 's the game plan here ? We just gonna knock on the door , ask ' em if we can tear out their walls ? Pretty much . I guess the badge is the " Pretty , please " in that equation . There 's no lights on . I 'm gonna call in . See if we can track down the owner for consent . What 're you doing ? What ? This is barely even a crime . I used to live here . Normal pupil response . Taking any medications , prescribed or illicit ? You can be truthful . I won 't judge . In fact , if the answer is no , I may encourage some drug use . No , none . Any food allergies ? - Not that I 'm aware of . - Good , good , good . This all checks out . Strap him down . We 'll get started . Oh , God ! Strap me down ? There 's nothin ' to be worried about . I guess , uh- - It must seem pretty silly . Thinking God is talking to me and everything . What were you supposed to think ? That I was just crazy . I considered that , too . It 's gotta be sort of a relief , right ? Knowing there 's a rational explanation ? I wouldn 't exactly call any of this rational . Do you really think that this is going to help you catch the guys that killed those people on the bus ? You 're our best lead . No pressure , huh ? We lived here when I was a kid but ... After Walt was institutionalized , my mom couldn 't afford the mortgage , so we moved down to an apartment in Austin . So where 's your mother now ? That 's a story for another time . So tell me . Of all the possible career choices , how did a girl like you end up in Law Enforcement ? Well , I pretty much knew this was what I wanted to do by the time I was nine . When I was nine years old , I think I wanted to be a Brontosaurus . You know , they say that psych profiles of cops and criminals are pretty much identical . Ever consider a life of crime ? No dental . Nothing . Of course . What ? My mom had this covered up . Used to hide in it all the time . You 'll need to be awake for the procedure . But I 'm going to give you a mild sedative , to reduce any anxiety . Dr. Bishop ... You look really familiar to me . I hear that a lot . In the mental institution where I lived . He 'll need a moment . Oh ! You 've returned . How was the old house ? How is Rufus ? Well , the house is just like we left , but we put Rufus to sleep almost 20 years ago , Walter . Oh ! That 's terrible news . We found your equipment . Oh , this brings back some memories . Of what ? I think it 's time for some intra-cranial penetration . This won 't hurt . Just feel a touch odd . Okay . Is this Poli Sci 101 ? Not remotely . Who was it ? Freshmen . I need you to keep this dial steady at 60 hertz , 10 gauss until I tell you otherwise . I believe there are clusters of metal in visual centers of your brain . I 'm going to attempt to move them to those regions which process sound . You 'll be shown a series of images . I need you to tell me any sensations you experience as you see each image . Sounds easy enough . First image , please . It 's a horse . Wonderful . 50 gauss . What the hell was that ? Oh , that was your body 's normal muscle responses . It 's perfectly natural . You may also experience an involuntary bowel movement . Great ! Next image , son . Oh , man . Mmm , oh , this is bad . Oh , this is weird . Uh , I-I 'm ... I 'm tasting , uh , dirt . Uh , no wait , it 's uh , gasoline . We 've reached the gustatory cortex . We 're getting close . Next image , please . I don 't know . It 's a beach . Well , no sensations at all ? I don 't think so . Goddammit , don 't you feel anything ? Uh , I 'm a little scared . I don 't understand . This should be working . Walter , take a deep breath . It 's gonna be okay . - Nuntia adhuc ... - You . - Increase the level to 200 gauss . - Ita , modo eum collocutus sum . Don 't do that ! Stop , I said ! Quando flet . What did you say ? I don 't know . I can hear voices . Una hora , locum statuisti . I think that 's Latin . It is . He just said , um ... Damn , what 's that word ? Hora , um ... hour . Something 's happening in an hour . How in the world can you possibly know that ? I majored in linguistics . My Latin 's admittedly a bit fuzzy . Okay , keep going . Ad stationem . Ad stationem , that means station . No , wait . It 's australem . - Australem means south . - And then ... Komor kiam kono eni mus . An exchange is being made . Um ... An exchange at south station . I think someone 's meeting at south station to make an exchange in an hour . Bene o befuit . He just said , " Good , where was it ? " - In eius corpore fuit . - From the beginning , on her person . It was on her person . It was on her from the start ? Maybe or- - She had it on her the whole time . Oh , yeah , that 's a possible translation . Hey ! Where ya goin ' ? Now , I 've been asked to officially ID her body . There was a three-inch incision in Evelina 's right palm . Whatever she had on her , Davidson cut it out . She was hiding it in her hand . I 'm heading to South Station now . I think he 's planning a hand-off at 5 : 00 . We have to assume Davidson 's workin for the same people who hit the bus . I 'll notify CI . But in the meantime , I 'm sending the Field Assist your way . But plainclothes only . We don 't want to tip him off . Oh , my God ! What 's wrong ? I believe with proper demodulation , you could receive satellite television for free . Okay. fun time 's over . Astrid , let 's get him unhooked . It 's me , I 'm at the station . Where am I meeting your man ? Excuse me ? I 'm getting something . It 's in English . We can see you . Outside South Station . We 're verifying you haven 't been followed . Then we 'll instruct you further . It 's Olivia . Hey , Roy 's talking again . Are you at South Station ? Yeah , why ? So are they . Did you get anything else ? They 're checking to make sure that Davidson wasn 't followed . I think that 's it for now . Okay , thanks . Could I get a drink or something ? Yeah . I 'll get you a glass of water . Go ahead . We 're clear on our end . Go inside . Here you go . And head to the Dewey Square Exit . You got that ? How will I recognize the person I 'm meeting ? They 'll recognize you . Yeah . It 's happening now . He 's headed to the Dewey Square Exit . Got it ! Francis . We got him . He 's at the south end of the terminal . Turn around and put your hands in the air now . Oh , my God ! What happened ? He 's been shot . - He 's not breathing . - Call in a Medevac ! The case . They 've made the exchange . He 's running . Stay with him . FBI ! Put the case on the ground . Drop the gun now ! Put your hands where I can see them . All that trouble for this . So any idea what it is ? Not yet . But I 'm hoping our friends at the NSA will be able to tell us . So 11 innocent people die today , we risk losing another by drilling through his head , all for something we know nothing about ? Do you ever smile , Dunham ? We ID 'd the shooter . Matthew Ziegler . When we ran his fingerprints , he popped up on two other pattern-related cases . We 're digging into his financials , travel records . Linkage , Dunham . Not only can we now put a face to these people , but we know they 're communicating . And how . I 'd say that 's an impressive day 's work . Which brings me to this . What is it ? Of all the models in Roy 's apartment , three of them are incidents that we haven 't been aware of . Pattern cases . It would seem so . Take a look . If you want . Let me know if you have any thoughts . I 'll do that . I 'll see you tomorrow . Yeah , I can use speech pretty clear . How are you feeling ? My head hurts a little , but , um , Dr. Bishop gave me something for the pain . Vicodin . That 's it . I promise . So no more transmissions . No . My guess is once you arrived at South Station with the cavalry , they realized the Ghost Network was compromised , and stopped broadcasting on it . Well just in case , if you hear anything else ... Do me a favor , gimme a call . I will . It felt really nice to be able to help . - Thank you ! - You 're welcome . I have a few release forms I need you to sign , - and then I can take you home . - Okay . Dunham . Any requests ? How ' bout some Bach ? Bach ? No , that 's way too stuffy . What you need is some jazz . Well , I 'll take what I can get . I 'm sure you can understand why I don 't wanna go through channels . If I know you at all , this isn 't the only reason you 're here . Is this because of our interest in Agent Dunham ? Seems a bit early to be poaching my newest hire , with only a three-case resume under her belt . I didn 't achieve my position without the ability to evaluate someone 's talents immediately . Neither did I. Oh , you feel protective of her , don 't you ? I 'm in the business of protecting all my agents . I want nothing but the best for her . Of course you do . We found another one . Let 's see what we have . Well , crystalline structure 's intact . No detectable oscillations . This may just be what we need to break the encryption . Speaking of which , I 'm told you 've made progress . See for yourself . We finally stabilized the link . We 've been pulling information from the disk for the last 72 hours . Let me know when it 's finished .

 217 , yeah , I 'm here . Where are you ? You 're hunting it ? How do you know it 's not hunting you ? Hello ? Hello ? Sarah ? You 're breaking up . Hello ? Whoa , hey , easy , easy , easy . Sarah Connor sent me , okay ? I 'm here to help . Sorry . I thought ... I know what you thought . You 'd be dead already . All right . - How far along ? - Thirty-four weeks . Okay . All right . Looks like a through-and-through . Caught her lung . I know , I need to put the tube in . Look , you ... Just hold her still . You stay still also . I 'm fine , okay ? I 'm fine . Okay , ready ? There you go . - You wanna tell me what happened ? - That thing . The cyborg . It 's been tracking us for six months . How 'd it find you ? How do you know Sarah ? Hey . Lauren , we don 't live in a barn . We close the door and we wipe our feet . - They 're alive . - Are you the Fields ? Lauren , go to your room and lock the door . - What do you want ? - I 'm here to help . Are you the Fields ? - Anne , call 911 . - No , no police . Go get the girl back . I need to get you out . Someone is coming . - I 'm not here to rob you . - Then put down the gun . You don 't understand . You 're in danger . We need to go . Just stand there . We had a hit of a name on the list . Alpine Fields , it 's a family . Everything 's under control . We might be late . Can you handle dinner ? John , just put the alarm on . - Teenagers , huh ? - Don 't move . Put the gun down . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Tell me the truth . The truth ? In the near future , a computer system called Skynet takes over the world . It sends humanoid machines back in time to eliminate anyone who 's a threat . I have a target list . Your name is on it . A machine is coming to kill you . It found your house in the city , now it 's coming here . - Your house sitter 's dead . - Call the police . Tell them there 's a crazy woman in the house with a gun . You . Stand over here with her . Hey , we 're going , now . Now . - What about Charles Barkley ? - No . - Why would you keep a gun in the house ? - Maybe for a situation like this . Or a bear . This wouldn 't work in a situation like this . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - Or a bear . I knew you 'd react like this . This is not helping . - Does your son know you kidnap people ? - Yes . - You know he 'll be prone to delinquency . - Mom , it 's obvious she 's beyond Dr. Phil . - You know , this is none of your business . - Sarah . - Come on . Come on , Dad . Let 's go . - Out . - Get back to the cabin , now . - Let 's go . Run ! I 'm coming , I 'm behind you . I 'm sorry . You should keep that covered . It 's a Saint Jude 's medal . It 's my grandmother 's . It 's a target . Where 'd you get it ? One of them . Oh . - Do I wanna know ? - Not really . You sound so used to all this . You don 't get used to it . You live through it . You sound like David . We were outside a motel in Elko when it found us . Dad emptied the Mossberg into that thing . And then he went after it with a table lamp and a curtain rod . Just long enough for us to get out . She told us to call if it came back . Do you think David could be all right ? Anything 's possible . What ? Nothing . I just know that look . Your plan sucks . You can 't use metal for this . Look , they hit Eagle Rock Bunker with a bioweapon that killed everybody inside . Only one person survived out of 200 . Now , we need her back here alive . Metal 's immune to disease , so we 're ... Tin cans are immune to disease , but not immune to going bad and putting a bullet in the person who could save us from this plague . I 'll find the survivor . I 'll bring her back . Just hope like hell she can help us . Once exposed , there 's no way to know how long you 've got . Could be four hours till the symptoms hit , 20 before the bug kills you . - This could be a one-way trip . - We 're all one-way trips . He 's not out there , you know . Your brother Kyle . He 's gone , Reese . Now , either you learn to live with that or die from it . She 's sleeping now . So you wanna tell me how it found you ? It 's best if I know . It was my fault . I used the phone . I called a friend . Roger . I guess I needed to feel normal , you know ? Like a person . - So you broke the rules . - Yeah . And rule number one is there is no normal . Down , down , down . I think I messed up my ankle . What the hell was that ? The thing from the future . We need to get him to a hospital . We need to call the police . No . You call the police , police come , that thing kills them . I need tape . We have to get out . Your car 's outside . We can just take your car . The road 's blocked . It 's out there . We won 't be going that way . - Is there another road out of here ? - No . Schafer 's got a road but it 's a mile through the woods , and I don 't think he 's there . Oh , God . Can you stand ? Barely . Leave me . Head for Schafer 's place . - See if you can get down that way . - David , we 're a mess . - We can 't run a mile through the woods . - No one gets left behind . - What about your daughter ? - She 's not my daughter . She 's one of them from the future . - No freaking way . - She 's on our side . I need to know which one of you that thing is after . Which one ? That thing wants one of you dead . I need to know why . Either of you deal with computers , technology , the military , anything ? I 'm a banker . She 's a housewife . - She 's nothing . - Hey . You know what I mean . It 's a mistake . We 're normal people . Here , do you want your Oxy , honey ? I have a bulging disc . L4 . Look we don 't know what we did , all right ? We can 't help you . I 'm sorry . - What 's this door handle made of ? - It 's oil-rubbed copper . Why ? I wanted to see if I could help . You can look for flashlights . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna set a trap . Do you have any hole-saw bits ? A metal cylinder with teeth ? Like for making holes for birdhouses ? I don 't know . I don 't make birdhouses . Me and my dad have made a million . Still waiting for our first bird family to move in . - That sounds so lame , right ? - Why would that sound lame ? Because you 're running around with guns , fighting robots . Cybernetic organisms . The outside is very real . You 're fighting cyborgs , and we 're building birdhouses . I 'd trade for birdhouses any time . What 's it like ? I mean doing what you do . It must be ... Why 'd you come out here ? You stand there like you 're gonna tell me a secret , but you don 't . My son does that . You really do this ? With a kid ? He 's why I do this . Is that it ? It 's my dad . There 's something he 's not telling you . Syndyne . Tell me about it . Syndyne Cybernetics , the company you 've been working with . Cybernetics ? What are you talking about ? David ? Computers , cyborgs , the future . Your husband 's been holding out . Okay , yeah , the tech company is one of my clients . These are the e-mails . This is what I asked for . Why didn 't you tell me ? It 's just business . It doesn 't have anything to do with robots . Cyborgs . - What were you doing ? - Business . Banking . Why do you need to know ? Because I 'm not here just to be nice and help your nice family . I 'm trying to stop the end of the world from happening and save my family . So I need to know what Skynet 's doing and why they 'd want you dead . Why don 't you just tell her , David ? Because it 's not exactly legal , okay ? Why didn 't you tell me , David ? What part of " secret " and " illegal " do you not understand ? So this was an actual crime ? And what are you doing on my computer ? Looking at lesbian porn . What 's the difference ? - You 're gay ? - Lauren ? God , people , no . Thanks for knowing me . Well , I 'm sorry , but apparently your father is some sort of criminal mastermind . - Anne , you have no idea what it ... - Is any of this real ? Quiet ! This is very real . What is it ? - Is something happening ? - They 're hunting . Hunting what ? Each other . So are we safe ? No one is ever safe . I 'm sorry . I need some air . You know how to use this ? If you do , take it . If you don 't , leave it . You don 't go outside without it . Hello ? Hello ? Oh , jeez . Excuse me . Your fly 's open . Sorry . This keeps reopening . You need to lie still . Where is she ? Where is Lauren ? She went out for some air . And you let her ? With that thing out there ? Your kid will be fine . Lauren ? She hasn 't been a kid for months . It 's easy to think , and it 's easy to say . It 's not always so . What do you know about it ? I know she 's protecting you . I know that story she told me about calling that Roger guy was crap . She 's too smart to call anybody . But somebody called Roger . And I 'm guessing it was you . Kids can adapt to all this . It 's harder for adults . Is it necessary to destroy the entire house ? David , you got us into this . Let her do her job . - What can I do ? - In the bag , give me the black tape . You never asked where the money came from . I assumed you were earning it . - Now what ? - I 'm going to the bathroom . Is that okay ? - What 'll that do ? - There 's a chip in their head . The shock will trigger a reboot . If one of them touches this door handle , we have two minutes to get the chip out . - Does that work ? - I 've only tried it on the girl . And , no , it doesn 't always work . So , what guarantees he comes through the front door ? They always come through the front door . I didn 't know the lights worked . I switched the breakers back . Who you calling ? No one . Sorry . I 'm just checking the phone line . I 'm scared . - Hawaii ? - Yes . - Are you married to your son 's ? - No . Barely knew him . Lucky you . You think you 're getting this , then you realize you got that . - Don 't worry about the past . - It 's easy for you to say . I 'm not like you . I 'm just normal . I was normal . All this I had to learn . I thought crisis was supposed to bring a family closer . Don 't confuse close with happy . Hey , I see something . I saw something . I think someone 's coming . It 's not her . It 's a man . - I think it 's Mr. Schafer . - Who ? - It 's Roger from the next property over . - It 's okay . We know him . These things can look like anyone . - Friends , neighbors . - I told Roger we were camping this weekend . Charles ! - Dogs can smell these things . - It 's him . - What would he be doing ? - That 's him . - How could you know ? - The shock will kill him . - Wait . - Anne , you don 't know ... - Hey , Annie . - Roger , get inside ! He 's coming to see me , okay ? She never goes camping . She keeps the home fires going . With Roger ? Don 't confuse close with happy . I know it was stupid but I needed to let him know and now he 's dead . And David is dead . I know he is . I had no idea what happy was . It 's funny , the things you say to yourself . " Oh , I 've seen worse . " " It 'll be fine . " " Can 't happen to me . " But the worst is always out there , isn 't it ? And it can happen to you , and it isn 't fun . Even after everything , she 's still trying to cover for me . Protect my dignity , I guess . She needs it to be normal . She needs it to be good or seem that way . All right . I 'm done . No more talking , okay ? It 's gonna get your heart rate up . It 's not good . Doesn 't matter . Lauren matters and this baby matters . They 're all that 's gonna be left of me after this is over . A mother knows . You the one ? Who sent the signal ? No . My shore party picked up a coded SOS about 45 ticks back . Sent me to fossick around . What 's that in English ? Means someone 's still alive inside . Probably a civilian . Probably hiding . Radio room , I 'm guessing . I didn 't go in that far . What 'd you say about a shore party ? Been making troop and supply runs back and forth from Perth for months . Seawolf sub . The Jimmy Carter . You 've got a nuclear sub ? Who drives it ? Not who . What . We got a scrubbed Trip-8 for a captain . You 've got metal running a sub . Huh . Well , you find me a sub commander who survived J-day , I 'll switch him in . Have a little faith , mate . She 'll be apples . Means we 'll be all right . You believe that ? - Sure as my mother loves me . - My mother 's dead . Here . - Gas ? - Bugs . This gonna work ? Probably not . Come on , come on . - We need to get her to a hospital . - This isn 't like last time . It 's not gonna happen . - She needs a doctor . A real doctor . - She needs you to keep it together . - Oh , yeah ? Who put you in charge ? - You did , just now . Until Sarah comes through that door , the safest place in the world is here . They can 't kill it . They couldn 't kill it before , they can 't now . Baby . Baby , I 'm sorry . - When did this affair start ? - You wanna talk about this now ? - Last summer when I couldn 't travel ? - You have a bulging disc from sleeping . - I slipped and fell ... - You have a weak core . - Well , at least my core isn 't a slut . - Hophead . - Whore ! - Hey . That is your wife . Hey , don 't you ... - Hey . - Hey . Damn it . Fuses are fried . Not sure I can get the power rerouted . And who is this , again ? Sarah . She saved our lives . From the guy who looks like a guy but is a robot ? - It 's real , Roger . - A real man , maybe . - But , Anne , robots ? - The correct term is " cyborg . " Roger ? Did you drive here ? No , but I got the 540 at my place . A mile away , and we 're out of here . With that thing out there , we 'll never make it . Fine , David . I 'll carry you . You have no idea what you 're talking about . Right , right . Cyborgs . Anne , look at me . She 's a crazy woman . The guy in the woods is probably her meth-head boyfriend or something . This is what we 're gonna do . Come to my place . We 'll head into town , get everyone fixed up and then we 'll talk all this through like adults . - What the hell is that ? - It 's one of those things . - Is it dead ? - I hope not . This is a good one . Is she ? - I don 't think so . - Can you turn her back on ? It 's coming ! Roger . Roger ! - What are you doing ? - I 'm the one it wants . - Somebody 's gotta do something . - Can 't let you do that . Lady , I don 't give a damn about Skynet , or whatever the hell it is you 're selling . I 'm trying to save my family . So let me go out there and do it , or I 'll do it right here . Daddy . I 'm sorry . For everything . Hey . I 'm David Fields , the one you want . Take me . Leave my family . That 's right . Do me a favor . It 's not him . It 's after one of you . Someone 's not telling me something . I can 't help you both run . Anne ? David doesn 't know . It 's not his . You 're pregnant ? Go . Stay in here . Don 't make a sound . I 'm gonna help your mom get to Roger 's car . Wait . No , you can 't . It 's after you . She 'll be safe here . Mom , I get it . I 'll be okay . - You sure ? - I mean , I 'd rather be making birdhouses . Me too . Okay , Anne . Let 's go . I did this to you . I 'm sorry . - What is this about ? - You wanna know what this is about ? This is about your mother and your baby sister and they need you right now . My baby sister ? What ... ? How do you ... ? Oh , God . You 're from the future . Your sister 's name is Sydney and I knew her . Those gas masks , they won 't help . You 're already infected . Sun 's up . We can 't move out till night . That 's when the tin cans switch to infrared . Guess we 'll just have to sit it out and wait . When we get to Serrano Point , they can cure this thing ? Let 's just get to Serrano first . - What is this ? - Plumpy 'nut . Peanut butter mixed with baby formula and vitamin powder . Slept on top of a pallet of it on the trip over from Perth . - You guys are growing food again ? - Yeah . Beats chasing rabbits . Rabbits ? Thought Australia was all wombats and wallabies and stuff . No . Some whacker brought them over in the 1800s . We 've been overrun with them ever since . Tried everything to kill the things . Trapped them , shot them , poisoned them . Built a fence across half the country to keep them out . In the 1950s , they even introduced a virus to wipe them out forever . Killed most of them , but a couple were immune so 10 years later , Oz was up to its eyeballs in rabbits again . Tough little bastards . That 's why you have to cook them longer . Can you pass me your water ? I 'm parched . Let 's go . In broad daylight ? Just because you 're death-crazy doesn 't mean we 've enlisted . It starts with a dry mouth . And then the sweats . Then the fever and shaking starts . And then your lungs fill up with fluid , and then you die . You don 't have much time . It 's coming . Let 's go . So you 're from the future , like them ? Like those machines ? Yeah . Yeah , like them . And in the future , you know my baby . So does that mean she makes it ? Your daughter Sydney has an immunity in her blood . She helps us cure a deadly disease . She saves a lot of lives . Sydney . And Lauren ? Does she save her too ? - He 's human ? - Yes , of course . My mistake . Come on . Come on , get in . Go around , go around . She 's fully dilated . You have to do this , baby . You have to do this . My sister 's coming . You know what Oscar Wilde 's last words were ? " Either the wallpaper goes , or I do . " I thought it 'd be over by now . You 're ready for it . No . No , I 'm not . Then what were you doing when I found you outside Eagle Rock ? I think I was waiting for you . Thank you for saving my sister . I 've been where you are . There are days when you don 't think you can go on , but you will because she needs you to . We all do . But even if they kill that thing , there 's more , aren 't there ? Does it ever end ? I don 't know . We 're trying . Come stay with us . - I don 't know . - Think about it . I have to do this . Did you get it ? I mean , when this happened to you how long until you knew everything was gonna be different ? Right away . I don 't know if they get it . They 'll need your help . They always have . Sarah . Hey . Yeah , I 'm still here . Did you get the Triple-8 ? Are you sure ? Yeah , that does sound pretty sure . Um ... Baby 's fine . Girl 's a tough kid . I told her she could come stay with us . Well , it can 't get much worse , can it ? Yeah . Yeah , call me when you get back . Lauren , I ...

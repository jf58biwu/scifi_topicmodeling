 Previously on Heroes . Mom , maybe I don 't have to be special . You could be President . Matt Parkman , meet Matt Parkman . This is why you can 't give up . We 're sitting next to each other . I hope you don 't mind . What are you doing here ? I 'm Rebel . I 'm helping people . People like us . You 're so desperate to be someone else . Shape-shifting , it 's your escape hatch . We should pool our resources . - See that agent over there ? - What about him ? To work with us , you 'll need a new identity . Agent Taub is the perfect choice . His life is now your life . All right . So , what now ? I 'll go back to Washington , take ownership of my mistakes , talk to the President . - Real change , change you can believe in . Looks like you already have . Bring real purpose back to the White House . Back to this country . And I promise you that when the President agrees to meet with me , when he agrees to shake my hand , real change will come and nothing will ever be the same . Who the hell is that ? Thank you all very much . Sylar . Why does this keep happening ? Who are you ? No , no , no , little Matty 's fine . I haven 't even put him down since I got him . Can I talk to him ? - Okay . Hold on . Mommy wants to talk to you . Matty ? It 's Mommy . Hi ! I love you , sweetheart . Is it Mommy ? And I 'll see you soon . I 'll get him back as soon as I can , all right ? Look , Janice , it 's really good to hear your voice . Thank you for doing this , Matt . Bye , Janice . Bye , Matt . Did the agents let your wife go ? Yeah . You don 't seem happy , Matt . Is everything okay ? Fine . I mean , I guess ... Look , Janice was attacked by Danko , this guy was abducted ... I guess I should be happy she 's talking to me at all . I 'm gonna take him home . Is that a good idea ? Won 't the agents just come after Baby Matt again ? No , this time I have a plan . Good . When you return Baby Matt to Mrs. Matt Parkman , all will be forgiven . I don 't think so . I think that train 's already left the station . That is too sad . Baby Matt needs a mother and a father . Maybe you can still protect him . Help us take down Building 26 . Yes . This isn 't a game , guys . Danko and his men are killers . Just let it go . This isn 't the Matt Parkman I know . Matt Parkman isn 't afraid of anything . I am afraid . I 'm afraid that I 'm gonna miss out on this guy 's childhood . I 'm afraid that I 'm not gonna see him take his first steps or throw his first baseball . I want him to know that he has a father . This little guy is a game changer . Yes . It 's hard to argue with that . Okay , Matt Parkman . You go win your family back . We will go to Building 26 and stop them . Tell us the address . No . Why not ? So , what are you gonna do ? Freeze time ? And then what ? We will stop them . Well , eventually , you 're gonna have to unfreeze time , and when you do , some of those agents are gonna be alive , and they could hurt you . Or worse . I can 't have that on my conscience . Thanks for saving my life . Now go save your own . Goodbye , Matt Parkman . Goodbye , Baby Matt Parkman . One of my analysts spotted Sylar on a surveillance camera near K Street . I assured him he was mistaken . We all know Sylar 's dead . Except for you . You understand this is the only way this will work . Sylar died to give you your freedom . My freedom . How ironic . How so ? Last night , I went to sleep as myself , I woke up as Agent Taub . I didn 't mean to change , I just did . I 'm losing myself . Look at this . I found an extra tooth in my mouth last night . Where did that come from ? I 'm shifting and reassembling my DNA so much , it 's not coming together the same way . Maybe you should just stay as Agent Taub for a while . Agent Taub is a nothing . I don 't like being a nothing . Think of it this way . As Agent Taub , you can come and go , kill who you want to kill . If you 're Sylar , I have no choice but to hunt you down , make your life a living hell . It 's up to you . Wait . Good . See you at work . I love hot cocoa . Do you mind ? You don 't want to startle me . That 's funny . There was a time when I wouldn 't have given you a chance to be startled . You don 't understand . I can hurt you . No , I understand perfectly . You have an ability . What you don 't understand is that I 'm just like you , and I 'm gonna help you . Are you Rebel ? I 'm a rebel . Why are they hunting us ? They 're afraid of us . They destroy what they don 't understand . What about you , Tom ? Why are they afraid of you ? Show me what you can do . I really hate to do this . Do what ? That looks like fun . Fun ? Are you crazy ? Listen to me , Tom . The agents , they 're on their way here . You need to decide right now . Do you pick them or do you pick me ? You . I pick you . Good choice . Jeez , would you look at that ? Guy 's got some ego . You gotta be you . Is that it ? Yeah , something like that . You put me in a difficult position . I got you your target and a little something extra . He received a text from Rebel just before I arrived . Rebel 's still in D.C. Right under your nose . That 's good news . I could use your help to take him down . My help ? Or Agent Taub 's ? You need to play dead , Sylar . You know , one of my eyes stayed blue for over an hour yesterday . In the past five years , I 've lived eight different lives . I 've had wives and girlfriends . I spoke six different languages . But at the end of the day , I still know who I am . What 's your point ? Whatever you 're going through , this identity crisis , you can survive . How ? Find an anchor . Something that reminds you of you . That way , when you 're feeling lost , you 'll have something to hang on to . My father gave this to me 20 years ago . I look at this and I 'm home . May I ? Rodina . Soviet military issue . It 's running three minutes fast , gaining a half a second every hour . Otherwise , it 's a nice watch . Understanding how things work . Who 'd you kill to get that power ? That 's the only one that was ever truly mine . Hiro ! You Special Agent Taub ? So it seems . Unsolved murder of Virginia Gray . If you don 't mind me asking , what 's the Federal Government care about some dead old broad from Queens ? Nice talking to you . This one was my favorite . I bought this for you . I remember . It was Mother 's Day . You were such a sweet boy . Why did you lie to me ? I 've never lied . Not to you . I 'm your mother . I know the truth now . My real mother was killed in front of me . You were there . You saw it . That terrible man . And you were such a teeny little thing . I wanted to protect you , love you . I didn 't think the truth mattered . It mattered to me . All my life , I never felt like I fit in . I went to see my real father . He was so alone , so pathetic . I didn 't want to become him , so I took this power , and now I can be anyone I want to be , anyone in the world . So , tell me , Mom , why do I feel so lost ? You are not lost . You are my son . Maybe I didn 't give birth to you , but I loved you . I wanted you , right from the start . I saw how special you were . But I killed you . And there was no one left to love you anymore . But now , I 'm back . What are you doing ? Nothing . What do you want ? We found Rebel . Tell Agent Taub to come join us . Target 's holed up somewhere in that building . Okay . Kill the lights . Power grid is down , gentlemen . No electricity means no machines . Time to hunt down the son of a bitch . Let 's go . Taub , you coming ? You 're Rebel ? You 're just a kid . I know who you are . I sincerely doubt that . I know you have a problem , and I think I can help . And do tell me , what is my problem ? You 've forgotten who you really are . Yeah . You 're gonna help me with that ? Yeah , I can . You 're one of us . People with powers . We 're all connected . You don 't have to be alone . You 're alone , Micah . Family 's all gone . All you have left are these machines and your false hopes . No . We can help each other . Too late . I joined the other side . They don 't know you . They can 't see how special you are . You can save us all . Since when do you wear glasses ? Huh ? I want every floor secured . Rebel is running . He 's on the pier ! He 's just a kid . I said take him down ! Now ! Take him down ! See him ? See something yet ? I don 't see him ! This was very unlike you . Why didn 't you kill him ? Take his power ? My head 's already spinning with the powers I have . I thought talking to machines seemed like overkill . We couldn 't find the kid 's body . Feels like a loose end . He 's not a healer . Dead is dead . We got intel from his system . Location on dozens of specials . I 'll need you to go after the more dangerous ones . Be the hunter , not the prey . That 's the idea . You can start tonight . Just as soon as you change your face . MRS. - I am so proud of you , Gabriel . This doesn 't feel right . It 's not who I am . Why would I save him ? You saved him because he 's a lost little boy , an orphan , like you . He doesn 't have his mommy to love him anymore . Why should that matter to me ? You understand how he 's feeling , how lost he truly is . Isn 't that right , Micah ? I shouldn 't have brought you here . You can shape-shift . How do you do that ? I seem to be able to absorb people 's DNA . My mom could do the same kind of thing . On the inside . It made her kind of crazy . But she fought back and became a hero . I am not your mother . You can change into someone who can make a difference . Like ... Nathan Petrelli ! You can tell the President that he 's made a big mistake . I 'm giving you a chance to leave . I would take it before I change my mind . And don 't come back . If I find you again , I 'll kill you . Look at the ribbons . It 's all so pretty . He was born with a silver spoon . He was given everything . Money . Schools . Family . MRS. GRAY : Yes . But you have a gift . You 're special . You didn 't need anybody to help you , and now , you 'll be a senator . I am so proud . Stop it . What 's the matter ? You know you 're better than him . You know you 're better than all of them . I 'm not better . I killed you . It was an accident . You didn 't mean to kill me . It wasn 't an accident . Don 't you understand ? I wanted you to die . The way you looked at me , like I was some kind of monster . I felt so small . Then you came at me with those scissors . How can I be special ? How can I be anything when I killed the only woman who ever loved me ? So that 's how you lost yourself , why you 've brought me back . I forgive you , Gabriel . I 'm so sorry . And now you can be anything you want . Be a senator or ... Or maybe even President of the United States . You 're right . I can be anything I want . I can be President . I won 't let you down , Mom . Look at this . See ? Mommy 's gonna be right back . Do you miss her ? I bet you do . Wow , look at this . Mommy 's doing pretty good , huh ? Before you were born , Mommy and Daddy weren 't getting along so well . I didn 't even know that you existed . She didn 't know that I would take one look at you and fall in love . Which is what I did . I fell in love . Wow . Nice room . You know , I know what you 're thinking , and I can 't . I can 't just put a whammy on Mommy , make her forget everything and forgive me . No , I can 't do that . ' Cause we can 't use our powers on unsuspecting people . Oh , thank God . Thank God ! Hi . Hi . Thank you for bringing him back . Yeah . What ? Come on , he 's ... He 's really a great kid . It 's good to see you . Yeah . You , too . What is it ? We 're being watched . I can hear them . There 's a van down the street filled with agents . I can hold them off for now , but I got to get you two out of here . My folks ' summer house at the lake . Good , good . You pack , I 'll watch Matty . What about you ? I mean , I could come , too . I just ... I know . That 's crazy . But , Janice , I 'm his father and I want to be a part of his life . We have a lot to talk about . Ladies and gentlemen , our country faces the biggest challenges we 've seen in a generation , from terrorism to global economic chaos . Our leadership is ill-prepared to meet these challenges . We need to shake up the power structure in Washington in order to bring real change to America , and I have a plan that will do just that . You may ask , why aren 't I presenting this new initiative to the President ? Believe me , I 've tried . My office has made numerous phone calls to the White House , but it seems the President is just too busy to meet with me face to face , too occupied keeping the status quo , business as usual . It seems he likes to talk about change , but he isn 't ready or willing to make it . I know a way to bring real purpose back to the White House , back to this country . And I promise you that when the President agrees to meet with me , when he agrees to shake my hand , real change will come to this country , and nothing will ever be the same . How is he doing this ? He 's a shape-shifter . And now he 's one handshake away from being the most powerful man on Earth . Maybe the President won 't meet with him . Are you kidding me ? After that vitriol ? I 'm sure my staff 's arranging a sit-down with him as we speak . We need a plan . No . I got to do this myself , Noah . You made that mistake before , Nathan . Trying to do it all by yourself . It doesn 't work . She 's right . We can help you . Look , I don 't have to fight him . I just have to make sure that he doesn 't meet the President first . Sylar will expect that . He 'll be waiting for you . I 'll go with you . I started this , Pete . I gotta end it . Matt , did you find his pacifier ? Matt ? Right . Okay . Ready . I 'm so sorry , Janice . I can 't go with you . Why not ? Because ... This is perfect . This house . Our boy . You . This is everything that I 've been searching for . And maybe I didn 't even realize it , but Hiro was right . I have to go back , I have to face them , and I have to end this , or we can never have a life together . You want a life together ? I don 't know . Maybe . But I know that I want a chance to get to know you again and I 'm gonna fight to make that happen . Oh , God , they 're coming . Come here , buddy . Here you go . Come here . Matt , they 're in the back . It 's okay . We 're surrounded . It 's okay . It 's okay . Just stay close to me , okay ? I 'll protect us . Both to the side . Down there . Looking for this ? Get the hell out of my body . Poor Nathan . You loathe yourself so much . What the hell are you talking about ? I 've taken a stroll through your life , Senator . You 've been handed so much and yet you want to destroy the one part of yourself that makes you truly special . Your power . You have no idea who I am . Sure , I do . Your mother gave me a very useful ability to know the history of any object I touch . You have been a bad boy . Deceiving your mother , turning on your brother , your sweet , precious Claire . And this is the jacket you wore when you betrayed everyone . I don 't need to defend myself to you . You 're pathetic . You 're a psychopath . People like you are the reason I went to the President in the first place . If you think for one minute anybody 's gonna believe you 're me , you 're wrong . I 'm not going to be you . I 'm going to be better than you . Goodbye , Nathan . What the hell did you do that for ? Petrelli 's a US Senator . We need to handle him delicately . And you need to become Agent Taub again . We 're moving to take the rest of them down . You should be part of that . For every being cursed with self-awareness , There remains the unanswerable question . " Who am I ? " We struggle to find meaningful connections to one another . We are the caring friend . The loving father . The doting mother . The protected child . We fight and we love in the hope that somehow , together , we can understand our significance in the universe . But in the end , no one can share our burden . Each of us alone must answer the question . " Who am I ? " What does it mean to be alive ? " And in the vast infinity of time , how do I matter ? " What are you doing ? I told you I need you to be Taub . I 'm not interested in what you need anymore . Such a waste . You just didn 't know your place . Agent Gordon , send a clean-up crew to ... Check that . That hurt .

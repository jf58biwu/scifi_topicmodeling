 Over the last 60 years 4400 people have been abducted All at once they were returned With no memory of where they 've been They haven 't aged a day And some have returned with new abilities All are trying to reconnect with a life interrupted ( ) Previously on the 4400 ... lily , are you all right ? - Where 's my wife ? - What are you talking about ? Mr. Tyler , when your wife fainted this morning , she was a young woman . When she woke up less than a minute later , she was 50 years older . Are you my mother ? ( ) I understand there was an incident this morning . You attempted to harm yourself . You had no right to do that ! Don 't you understand who you are ? What you 're here to do ? I 'm injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum . I will have taught my body how to produce promicin , and then I will be the first non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities . That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse . When she hit this place , T.J. Drove every man in the building into a homicidal rage . Ever since we took them off the inhibitor , they 're either developing new abilities or they 're refining the ones that they 've got . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) 1 ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) 2 You sold us out . I don 't guess we 'll be seeing her in court any time soon . This is a message from the nova group . We are the defensive wing of the 4400 . Today , the world has seen what happens to those who try to harm us.A new era dawns . Hi . Need your auxiliary rounds as well , agent baldwin . Oh , yeah . Of course.I forgot , ian.Thanks. - You can go in . - Great . Hi , T.J. What do you want ? Dr. Burkhoff ? I have your prescriptions . Hello ? Say something if you 're here . Don 'T . Please . I 've been having migraines . How severe ? Bad enough . Don 't worry.They 're just headaches . I 've been getting them for years . 7 : 45 . You 're just in time for my wake-up call . How many a day are you up to now ? Six . You 've doubled your dosage ? I thought you weren 't going to do that we 're talking now . Look , I 'm training my body to produce a new neurotransmitter . And I guarantee you i 'm not the only one trying . The moment the first 4400 manifested an ability , an arms race began . Someone is going to produce a promicin serum that will cause non-4400s to develop extraordinary abilities.It will happen . The only questions are who 's going to do it and who 's going to control it ? Hopefully someone with a highly developed sense of responsibility ... and some judgment . Let me ask you- - in your day-to-day affairs ? Do a lot of them hold high-ranking government posts or sit on the board of giant pharmaceutical companies ? Dr. Burkhoff ... I knew that you had some ... personality quirks , but I never pegged you for a cynic . I can 't afford to have a charitable view of human nature.There 's too much at stake here . If these experiments cost me some headaches ... some sores ... I 'd say that 's a price worth paying . Wouldn 't you ? I 'm here , right ? Holy mother- - why are we doing this ? Everything I 'm telling you , it 's all in my file.You know it already . Relax , T.J. I just think it 's important we review everything you 've told the government so far . Have we ? Yes . That 's everything I know . Okay . Thanks for your cooperation . We 're just trying to consolidate information . You 'd be amazed how hard that can be in a bureaucracy . Yeah , well ... I hope you don 't expect me to say " you 're welcome . " What are you doing ? What , this ? It 's nothing . I 'm just wraping up the interview . SYNC CORRECTIONS : klepal - Being Tom Baldwin - The 4400 ( 2006 ) Season 03 Episode 03 Get geared up.We 're leaving in two minutes . What for ? What 's going on ? Your partner registered to see T.J. Kim this morning . When tom left the interview room , T.J. Was dead . - What ? - Two gunshot wounds to the head . Apparently , tom snuck a small firearm into the interrogation room . By the time the guard went into the room and found T.J. ' S body , tom had already left the building . - We 're going to pick him up right now . - Wait , wait . This is tom we 're talking about here . There 's got to be some explanation . Maybe T.J. Used her ability on him . No , she had concentrated promicin inhibitor pumping through her veins . We 've tried to contact tom , but he hasn 't been picking up his phone . We need to get him in here just let me talk to him first . He trusts me . Now , this is tom . Come on.We owe him that much . Yeah , okay . I wasn 't trying to drown myself . I don 't even know if I could . Okay . Isabelle , I just thought that after everything that happened with lily- - shawn ... this has nothing to do with my mother . I was teaching myself to swim . In your clothes ? Well , I never wore a bathing suit before . I didn 't know what to get . And I 'm too old to ask for help . It 's embarrassing not knowing how to swim . Everybody 's got to learn sometime , isabelle . I learned when I was a kid . But I never was a kid . That 's why I never learned how to swim , or how to drive , or ever went out on a date . I keep reading about all these ... rites of passage . Like stuff everyone goes through before they grow up ? Yeah.Yeah , but I am grown up ... and I missed out on all of it . It 's not fair . I 've got to catch up , so I made a list . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) Well , isabelle , there 's a pool at the center . I could probably teach you the basics . Really ? Thanks , shawn . Dad ? How old were you when you learned how to swim ? ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) You want me to teach you ? Shawn said he 'd do it . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) Well , just make sure he doesn 't throw you in the deep end right away . That 's what my grandmother did to me . Look , isabelle ... I 'm going to be gone overnight . If you need anything , see shawn . Where are you going ? I 'm going to take your mother home . I 'm putting her to rest . Well , can I come with you ? I don 't think so . I 'm flying , and ... I don 't think you 're ready to be away from the center yet . You want to be alone with her when you say goodbye , don 't you ? Yeah , I guess I do . - Tom . - God ! You scared the hell out of me , diana . What are you doing here ? Why is your gun out ? What the hell is going on ? Jarvis is on her way over . She 's got everyone with her.You need to come in . What are you talking about ? You shot T.J. Kim this morning . - What ? - You don 't remember ? Don 't remember ? I didn 't shoot anybody . I 've been here all morning . Can someone confirm that ? No.No.I was supposed to have a conference call they canceled , though . Look , I took a half a personal day , diana.I went jogging.I wasn 't at work . You got to stop saying that , because two dozen people saw you there . Now , I don 't know what 's going on . Maybe you 're blacking out , like kyle did . Maybe it 's something else . Maybe it 's like some 4400 ability . I mean , I don 't know , but ... ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) 1 and what happens if I do ? I get arrested for murder ? You know , we 'll figure it out , okay ? Everyone wants to help you . You just--you just have to come in . You mind if I get dressed first ? Sure . Are you sure you remember everything you did this morning ? There 's no time gaps or anything ? You didn 't take a nap ? Tom ? Tom ? Damn it . Yeah , hi . It 's me.He got away . I-I don 't know how . They only sent one agent after him . Look , sorry.He got away . What ? No way . He 's an ntac agent . They 'll be expecting that . Okay . You 're right.This has to happen.I 'll do it . I was letting him get dressed . I didn 't think he would jump from a second story window . Well , obviously , you underestimated your partner 's resolve . Does he still seem blameless to you ? I don 't know.Look , it was a really bad call , and I take full responsibility . I 've alerted local law enforcement , the fbi . I 've told them that tom is wanted for questioning in connection with a murder . He 's a fugitive now . Oh , don 't give me that look , diana . I had no choice . Sorry . - It 's tom . - Yeah . Tom ? I 'm sorry I ran out on you . Where are you ? I believe you.But you have to come in , and we can figure out what 's going on . No , I 'm not going to jail . No one 's going to put you in prison . They did it to my son , diana . Was it really him that pulled the trigger the day jordan collier died ? He 's incarcerated . ( ) You 're a fugitive , tom . Every police department in washington is looking for you . Some local cop wants to be a hero , spots you , you know how these things can end . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) Look , dig around , diana.There 's got to be some evidence that will clear me . Just ... help me find it . Did he give you a location ? Marco , help me out here . If you were trying to prove that your partner didn 't commit a crime that the whole world thinks he did ... where would you start ? Well , I guess I 'd start by pretending that my partner wasn 't involved . Okay , just think of it like any other case . What 's the first thing you do when you start ? Well , look at the evidence . I mean , there 's a dead body , there 's the gun that tom left behind , and there 's a bunch of people that saw him here . Well , they 've got security cameras down in the detention ward , right ? You 're serious ? You 're really asking me for all that footage ? Of course I 'm serious . Is that a problem ? Well , it 's just ... I gave all the tapes to him , like an hour ago . what are you talking about ? I haven 't been up here all day . What is this , a joke ? Marco , come on . You were just here.You signed for all the footage from the detention ward . This isn 't so hard . That 's because i haven 't let go yet . All right ... I 'm going to move my hands . Are you ready ? No , not yet.I 'm kind of comfortable . You 're kind of comfortable ? I 'm freezing . I don 't know what 's going on . This pool 's supposed to be heated . - Want me to make it warmer ? - You can do that ? I think so . Hold on . How did you do that ? I don 't know.How do you heal ? It 's not the same , isabelle . Healing 's one thing . That 's what we can all do--one thing . Not me.I guess I 'm different . Shawn . Sorry to barge in . We 're scheduled to brief the board of directors . - That 's starting now ? - Five minutes ago . They 're on hold . Psst . Alana . What are you doing here ? I 'm in trouble . My bosses at ntac , they think i did something . I need you to come with me . - What are you talking- - - I don 't have time to explain . Thomas ! - Hello ? - Alana , I 'm right down the street . I need you to come meet me . Honey , I 'm in trouble . Everyone thinks I killed somebody . Who is this ? I know it 's not thomas . What are you talking about ? I 'm looking at thomas right now . Honey , listen , that 's not me . The man you 're looking at , he can impersonate me somehow . I don 't believe you . He walked into ntac and he shot someone this morning . Alana , he 's dangerous.Get away from him . Alana , listen to me . Your mother 's middle name is madeleine . You wanted a dog when you were a kid , but your parents gave you a bird instead , a parakeet named charlie . Listen , we made love last night . There were two candles burning . Just hold on.I 'll be right there . Did I have a dog when I was a girl ? I don 't have time for this . - What are you doing ? - What 's going on , tom ? - Are you all right ? - Yes . - Where is he ? - He just ran through the back . Hey ! Did you see a guy come down this alley ? He looked exactly like me . - I didn 't see anybody . - Are you sure ? He 's gone . He 's gone . What do you mean ? He just ran out a few seconds ago . There was no one here.Just some kid . It was him . It had to be.I had him . Had who ? What kid are you talking about ? The one who 's impersonating me . The guy who 's framing me for murder . He looked like you.He sounded like you . He was standing as close as you are right now , and he had me completely fooled . ( ) At least we know what 's going on now . He 's a 4400 , isn 't he ? Somehow he can pass himself off as you . Yeah . I 'm not sure how . I mean , maybe he 's got some kind of optical camouflage . He can convince your brain you 're talking to whoever he wants you to see . He 's a boy.Why would he want to kill anyone ? Not just anybody . T.J. Kim , I mean , think about it . You get rid of the one member of your cell who could testify against you , you compromise a government agent , and ntac , the one agency that 's trying to hunt you down , is wasting their time chasing one of their own . Alana . You might want to get in here . There 's all kinds of people flashing badges everywhere . They said they 're ntac agents . Look , stall them.I want you to go home . I want you to lock the doors , and don 't open it until this is all cleared up . If I need to get ahold of you ... I 'll use a password . How about " death in venice " ? Your favorite book.That 's a good choice . Listen , shawn , thanks for letting me come in here . I just didn 't know where else to go . Look , you guys must have a database of 4400s here , right ? I need to get a look at it , here . I can pull it up on my laptop for you . This might take a while . You mind if I let myself out ? There you go . You know , uncle tommy , you can stay here if you want . I might take you up on it . All right ... but hey , you get the couch . Okay ... kidneys , huh ? That explains the blood in the urine . Kevin , we had a deal . I was going to help you through this as long as it wasn 't compromising your health . Well , guess what- - I 'm calling the hospital . But they won 't let me take my shots . Oh , no . You 're done with your shots . I know we had an agreement , and I 'll honor it . Just let me show you something before you call . What happened to your fingernails ? Uh , they fell off . Dissolved , I guess you 'd say . If you 're trying to change my mind , you 're not doing a very good- - Kevin ... what the hell did you just do ? Your tissue is healing itself ... from trauma that quickly ? Kevin , you 've developed a 4400 ability . It 's getting there . It doesn 't always work . Doesn 't always work ? I was nervous about that . It 's fun to drive fast . Yeah . All that information about compression rates and gear ratios just seems completely irrelevant . Well , you 're not driving home . Get out of there . You 're lucky you didn 't wrap my car around a pole . Is there anything on this list of yours that involves , you know , a little less risk of bodily harm ? We could have sex . Come on.You have a big bed . Whoa , isabelle , hey ... uh , no . Why ? It 's on my list . It 's an important rite of passage into adulthood . It 'll be fun.I was good at driving . ( ) I don 't know . For one thing , your dad would kill me . Why ? I 'm an adult . Well , you are and you aren 'T . Let 's just say he has a right to have an opinion on the matter . I don 't know , isabelle.I feel like I 'd be taking advantage of you . But I want to . Well , I 'm flattered.I really am . But I just don 't think you 're ready to make that decision.We barely know each other . I know you better than I know anyone else in the world . That may be true . It 's still not going to happen . Lessons with isabelle going well ? They 're not lessons , and it 's completely innocent . Do me a favor and don 't ask about them again . - This is skouris . - His name 's boyd gelder , diana . He 's a 4400.I know where he lives . Where who lives ? Who 's boyd gelder ? The kid who 's doing this . And not just imitate . He can be me . At least make you think he 's me . He lives with his mom . I 'm in schenley park.It 's right by his house . Well , can you wait for me ? I 'll be 15 minutes . I 'll wait ... but diana , just you . Just me . We just got here.Where you going ? Schenley park . I think we caught a break on tom 's case . Tom ! Tom ! ( ) Just marco . At least , I thought it was marco . I looked across the park . You were standing there . But it wasn 'T . Tell me about it.You weren 't the one actually chasing yourself across the park . I mean , I don 't really run like that , do I ? It 's an amazing ability.Marco 's going to have a field day over this . Good.Get him working on it . We 're going to need a way to handle this guy wait , wait , wait.No , you don 't need to skulk around anymore . You can come in with me now . I 'm still on the hook for murder , diana . No , you 're not . Boyd posed as you.He shot T.J. Kim.You 're not responsible . Listen , I just saw his abilities that 's proof of something right there . I will back you up on everything you say . Which means exactly nothing . I mean , thank you , diana , but you 're my partner . Everyone expects you to stand up for me . There 's only one way to prove I didn 't kill T.J. Kim . - I have to get boyd gelder . - Okay , let 's go . You sure you want to come ? I 'm your partner . Everyone expects that I 'll stand up for you . I should be back by tonight . I 've ... been taking my time , stopping off at all the places your mother liked . Everything okay ? You been going to your doctors ' appointments ? Most of them . We need to keep monitoring you . I 'm fine . Shawn 's taking good care of me , just like you asked.He 's doing a really good job . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . He taught me the backstroke , he let me drive his car ... and then I asked him to have sex with me , but he said no . He said you 'd be angry.Is that true ? Isabelle ... you 're too young to be thinking about ... - that . But I thought I was almost 20 . How old were you when you lost your virginity ? It was ... things were a bit different in my day . It 's not the same . It 's not ? Why ? You know what , isabelle ? I 'm not having this conversation with you over the phone . So shawn was right.You are mad . I don 't understand . What does ntac want to talk to my son for , anyway ? He 's in some trouble.We can 't discuss it . We just need to talk to him . Well , he 's not here . He went away on a ski trip with some friends , and he won 't be back till tomorrow . Ma 'am ... your son is not on a ski trip , and this is serious.Is there any way you can contact him ? First tell me what 's going on.I mean , what is it you think my son did ? Mrs. Gelder , there are a lot of agents ... people get hurt.The sooner we get to your son , the safer he 'll be . So why don 't you call him and convince him you need to see him . ( ) ( ) Nice mom , nice house ... makes you wonder ... if the nova group can turn this kid , who else have they gotten to ? Everyone keeps telling the 4400 they 're here to save the world . - Whatever that means . - Exactly . Say what you like about nova . They do seem to have a game plan . Well , I 'm just guessing , but I don 't think that 's boyd . How the hell did ntac get here ? Maybe boyd figured out it was a trap and tipped them off . - ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) - Alana , open up . There are ntac agents watching the house . Death in venice , okay ? Open up . I don 't want anyone to see me come on . What did you do with your key ? I lost it.I must have lost it while I was running around . Come on.It 's me , tom , alana . I gave you the password . Please don 't make me . I don 't have anything against you . Tom ... says it 's your house . Alana ? I just wrote a letter on your computer . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) - Boyd ? - It 's a confession . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) You shot T.J. , And now you can 't live with it , so you 've decided to kill yourself . Where 's alana ? What did you do ? It 's my " get out of jail free " card . See , you 're the only one who could identify me . Everyone else , they 've just been seeing double.They 'll sound crazy . I 'm not signing a suicide note , boyd.Put alana on the phone . Oh , you 'll sign , ' cause either I shoot you ... or I shoot her . It 's a trade . Your life for hers . You know what ? I don 't think i can let you do this , tom . We need to call jarvis.We need to block off the street.We need to surround your house . - He has alana . - Tom , he wants to kill you.The least thing we can do is make it a little bit difficult for him . If it was mala in there ... would you call jarvis ? Do you like it ? Why did you bring this to me ? You 're a young woman . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) It 's going to look good on you . See for yourself . Thank you . I see you 've been spending a lot of time with shawn . So ? ( ) Shawn 's a very isolated young man . He doesn 't get to spend much time around people his own age . I think ... you should get as close to him as you can . Matthew ? Shawn 's nice . What I 'm doing with him is not for you , and it 's not because i 'm trying to use him . Of course not ... but eventually , isabelle , you and shawn are going to be on opposite sides of a very large ideological divide , so ... enjoy your friendship ... but don 't let your emotions run too deep . It 'll make things more difficult later . What things ? You 'll know . It doesn 't match your eyes . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) You were a beautiful woman . Both of you . You looked exactly alike . I never could figure out why . One way or the other , I 've had a lily in my life for over 50 years . That 's all gone now ... and I don 't know what I 'm going to do ... but , uh ... it makes me feel better knowing the two of you are together ... forever . This is it for you , you know . I don 't know what kind of fairy tale the nova group sold you , but it doesn 't matter what happens to me , or tom . Your life is over . They sent you on a suicide mission . I volunteered , and I don 't think you 're in any spot to be giving me advice . You 're a 4400 . You 're special . You 're supposed to be changing things . Live with an ntac agent . And what are you going to change , boyd ? You killed a girl . How does that make the world better ? T.J. Kim was a soldier . She would rather have me put a bullet in her head than betray us . Everyone talks about saving the world . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) Everything 's been turning bad , one disaster after another ... but we 're going to show the world a new way . We 're going to take them down a new path ... by force if we have to . Why can 't you see the real catastrophe is to sit back and do nothing ? Did you hear that ? Stop it ! Stop it , both of you ! Stop , or I 'll shoot . Nice work , alana.We got him.Shut up ! Alana , death in venice . Yeah , that 's the password . Come on , alana.Give me the gun . We 'll call ntac.It 's over . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) Ask me a question . Anything . Don 't fall for it . He 's probably read my file.He knows everything about us.Don 't listen to him . Ask me something about us . Something only I would know . Anything about us . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) Baby ... I am so proud of you . ( È ± Ò " ¾ ä ) You know about billy ? Yeah.That was your son . He died in a car accident . Alana , he did research . Anyone could find that out . Give me the gun.Just give me- - give me the gun . Alana , give me the gun . No.Alana ... give me the gun . Get down on the ground . What ? No , you 've got the wrong one . Think about this . I said get down . Don 't move . You 're just a boy . I 'm a soldier . And there are more of us every day . Let 's go , soldier . Welcome back . Yeah , thanks.Everything go okay ? Yeah , thank you , and thank you for keeping an eye on isabelle . Oh , well , it 's not a problem . Didn 't really do much . Yeah , well , thank you anyway . I worry about her . You don 't really need to . She seems to be getting along really well . I 'm her father . It 's my job . And it 's harder with isabelle . People see her , they see a woman , a beautiful woman ... and they might forget that inside she 's just a little girl . Still ... I 'm glad she has you around ... to be a friend . Sean ... How did you get in here ? I can do stuff , remember ? Yeah . So , what 's up ? What do you need ? Just one thing . It 's on my list . First kiss . This isn 't smart , isabelle . Okay .

Me ? Cool . Uber-cool , in fact . Hey , Luke . 'Mr Jackson , Sarah Jane 's not here , we need you . ' We 're sending over a picture now . 'It 's a drawing of an alien pendant . 'I 'm Rani , by the way . ' Nice to meet you . What do you want me to do ? 'You can hack into any computer , can 't you , Mr Jackson ? 'We need you to get into UNIT . See if they know what this pendant is . ' What 's UNIT ? Unified Intelligence Taskforce . They 're like the army , but they deal with aliens . I won 't even ask how you know that . 'OK , OK , let 's do it . ' Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ? All right , mate ? We 're looking for a motor . Something flashy , that 'll turn girls ' heads . Of course , sir . What sort of price range are we looking at ? Oh , money 's not a problem . We offer a number of different payment schemes . Save the patter , mate . I 'm having this one . It is a bit on the expensive side , sir . I 'm sure it is , but you 're going to give it to us for free . PENDANT FIZZES ALIEN VOICES I-I 'm going to give it to you for free . MOBILE RINGS Hello ? Hi , Clyde . You think you don 't know me , but you do , so please just listen . Look , who are you ? And why is your number in my phone ? I just ... I 'm your best friend . You 're a freak . Get lost . You ready ? You betcha ! FOOTSTEPS APPROACH I gave my dad some water , but he won 't stop . HE PANTS ENGINE REVS , TYRES SCREECH How 's it going ? Getting there . They 've got firewalls . I did think we 'd left this sort of thing behind us . A-ha ! Got it . Oh , my God . Dad ? It 's the UNIT archives . A photo . December , 1940 . What is it ? It 's what happens to you when you use the pendant . Do you remember when you were a kid and I said one day , I 'd show you the world ? Well , that 's today , my son . What 's that ? DISTORTED VOICE : Don 't worry about it . I won 't worry about it . Arrr ... UNIT know about it . The pendant belongs to this race of creatures - the Berserkers . 'From Norse mythology ? ' Still the brainbox , Luke ? The Berserkers were warriors who put on animal skins as armour . And they were vicious , and mad and ... Berserk ? 'Exactly . 'According to UNIT , they 're this race of superbad alien soldiers who , 'to build up their army , sent out loads of these pendants . ' How did one end up at the school ? 'The last sighting of it was at the Park Vale army barracks in Ealing . 'In December , 1940 , the base was destroyed by a German bomb . 'And that 's where they built the school . ' What does it actually do to you ? Every time you use it , it changes you . The Beserkers weren 't wearing animal skins , they were changing into something people couldn 't recognise . If Clyde 's dad is using the pendant , he 's turning into one of the Berserkers . Luke , Clyde 's in real danger . OK . Well , we 'll deal with it . We 'll find them . How ? He won 't tell us where he is . 'He doesn 't know us any more . ' I reckon I can help with that . Well , UNIT can . They 've got a satellite tracking system . I need to put in Clyde 's mobile phone number . Got him ! You having fun ? Oh , yeah ! D 'you want more fun ? Oh , yeah ! MUSIC : " See The World " by The Kooks INAUDIBLE Look at that . Put it on .

We weren 't working . I know , but did you even try ? Yeah , of course I did , but , these things happen . But you left me . I mean , today , it 's been brilliant and mad and everything , but you left me . I was just a kid and you died . I didn 't die ! That 's what it was like . My whole life up until that point had been you , Mum and me . The three of us . And then suddenly it was just me and Mum . And I was so scared . Every night , when I went to bed , I thought , " What if Mum leaves me ? " What if I wake up and it 's just me ... " alone ? " I never realised . I 'm sorry . Yeah , I know . Look , I just want to make it up to you . I want to make it better . I just ... DEEP VOICE : Look at me . I want you to forget all those feelings . Forget how I left you .

What have you done to him , Paul ? I knew you were trouble , but I never knew you could be such a ... .. monster . He 's not a monster . Dad ? Please , will you help us ? DISTORTED : What 's happening to me ? Mr Langer , it 's the pendant . Every time you use it , it overpowers you . Clyde , get back . It 's not safe . He 's my soldier and you can 't stop us , cos if you do , if you try to , I 'll tell you to walk into the water . I 'll destroy you all . HE LAUGHS MANIACALLY This whole world will do as I say . Dad , please . I 'm a Berserker and you will follow my orders . Oh , I don 't think so . Sarah Jane ! HE SNARLS I don 't understand what 's happening .

Be careful , Clyde . Remember ... Ich heisse Clyde Langer . Ahh ! Remember how you felt when you first met me . Remember how you came back for me . I remember . Look at the mirror . Look at your reflection . That isn 't you . Just remember what you are . Remember before the pendant , no Beserkers , no mind control . That 's not you , Paul . You need to remember who you are . Argh ! A-argh ! That 's it . You 're human . Just like the rest of us . ALL : Oh ! HE GROANS SALESMAN : Where 's the car gone ? Clyde ? You 're not gonna cry , are you ? THEY LAUGH All right , Rani ?

Alan searched the NHS database and found out which hospital I was in and he got a message to me . I 've got some very clever friends . What about this ? You know what to do . I 've got it , haven 't I ? I 've got my family back . The three of us , back together . Mum , Dad and me . It doesn 't work though . You can 't make us be together . I could . I could use this . Make you love each other again . And history would repeat itself . We 'd fall out . We 'd argue . We 'd be unhappy , then I 'd leave . Walk away . I could stop you . You could . Yeah ! It wouldn 't be real . I 'm going back to the car . Are you coming ? I want to say bye to Dad first . I 'm sorry .

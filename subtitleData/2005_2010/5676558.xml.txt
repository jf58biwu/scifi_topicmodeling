 - A child is born to innocence . - A child is drawn towards good . Why then do so many among us go so horribly wrong ? Everyone on the ground ! Now ! My name is Chandra Suresh . I 'm a geneticist . I have a theory about human evolution , and I believe you are a part of it . What makes some walk the path of darkness , while others choose the light ? Is it will ? Is it destiny ? Can we ever hope to understand the force that shapes the soul ? For thousands of years , my people have taken spirit walks , following destiny 's path into the realms of the unconsciousness . Okay . I 'm ready to begin my journey . Hiro ? Hiro ? To fight evil , one must know evil . One must journey back through time and find that fork in the road where heroes turn one way and villains turn another . I 'd like to thank all our dear friends for coming tonight , and for helping us to celebrate . Nathan , the finest Assistant DA New York has ever known . Peter , whose compassionate heart is a gift to us all . I told you he couldn 't say " nurse " out loud . All right . But most of all , to Angela , the love of my life . Happy anniversary . Cheers . That was lovely . Let me have a ... All right , get a room . After 41 years of marriage , you take it where you can get it . Congratulations , Mom . Congratulations , Dad . I love you , too . My king , my queen , congratulations . Thank you , Daniel . Congratulations . So , Nathan , are the rumors true ? Excuse me ? I heard your office is about to launch a full-scale investigation in all things Linderman . Care to comment ? I 'd shave my wrists . Handcuffs can chafe . Come on , let 's go . Good one . What do you see in there , Arthur ? Trouble . I 'm sure I can handle the heat . It 's not you I 'm worried about . If he starts investigating , he 's gonna see your hand behind every enterprise I 've been working on for the past 25 years . We can 't have the DA digging up skeletons . If you fall , I fall . Maybe you could talk to him one last time , convince him to back off . When Nathan digs his teeth in , he doesn 't let go . So , what do we do ? Read your Shakespeare . When the son challenges the father , only one is left standing . I should have one last talk with him . I owe him that . What happens if that doesn 't take ? Well , then I 'll kill him . And now who 's the man , y 'all ? I 'm the man . I 'm sorry . Who 'd you say ? Who 's the man ? I 'm the man ! Look at this here . Back door . Book it . Yeah , yeah , you got it . Flint ? Hey ! Hey , buddy ! - Hey , kiss the floor ! - Flint , let it go ! Hey , buddy , I 'm talking to you . You should listen to your sister . Run ! Flint , come on . Run ! My name is Brian Davis . Incredible . Can you make it go away ? Don 't worry , Brian . I can fix it . Don 't worry , Brian . I can fix it . Hello . Make it go away . Make it go away . Are you all right ? Say something . Forgive me . It 's okay . Everything is gonna be okay . No , it isn 't . I 've done something unforgivable . Everybody does bad things . You think I haven 't felt exactly how you 're feeling right now ? Maybe if you talk about it . Sometimes when you talk about it ... I can 't . A man had something that I wanted but I took it at a terrible price . I know it seems hard to imagine , but you 're gonna get through this because you 're not a bad person . You don 't even know anything about me . I know what I see , a man who deserves a second chance . The rope broke . You can 't tell me that 's not a sign . I don 't even know your name . Elle . Elle . Elle . Look at you , Elle , just showing up out of nowhere . Like an angel . An angel with a broken watch . Cute meet . I still don 't understand why we don 't just bag and tag this guy like the rest of them . For years , scientists were stumped by the mystery of whale migration . In such a big ocean , how do they find each other ? And then one night in the frozen Pacific , some enterprising biologist recorded their song in the wild . They don 't sing in captivity . So , we 've got to get the whale to sing ? What Mr. Gray can do is extraordinary . The ability to transfer power from one vessel to another is extremely rare . Yeah , but how do I get him to do it . Pie . Nine group homes in seven years , four of them burned to the ground . There 's a shocker . What 's the deal ? I mean , isn 't that why we 're here , so you can offer me a deal ? You have a gift , Meredith , and with gift comes opportunity . The Company would like to train you to become an agent . It won 't be easy . It 'll demand a lot of hard work . Me , an agent ? I don 't think so . Why do you hate the Company so much ? I have my reasons . Then I would ask you to put those reasons aside and make the sensible decision . That , or spend the rest of your life in an asbestos-lined cell . One condition . Promise me the Company won 't go after my brother . You 're not in a strong negotiating position here . So , what will it be ? Agent or prisoner ? When do I start ? Arthur . You look spectacular . I wish you would reconsider . He can barely fit a dozen people in that shoebox anyway . Arthur , it 's his graduation party . Yeah , from nursing school . Be patient with him . When his powers manifest , Peter will become a great man . Tell him I 'm sorry I couldn 't get there . Hey , there . Just thought I 'd stop by to see if ... I tried , he won 't . Nathan , while you 're here ... I really wish you 'd reconsider handing off the Linderman case to another ADA . Come on , Dad , we 've talked about this . I 'm not asking as a lawyer , I 'm asking as a father . I 'm concerned about the pressure that your prosecuting my client will put on this family . Don 't be . Linderman 's toxic to this family , Dad . Nothing would make me happier than to bury him in a very deep hole for a very long time . What ? You look good in a suit , Nathan . What 's this guy want ? Nathan ! Heidi ! Heidi ! Nathan , thank God . Is she all right ? Don 't even talk to me , Dad . Nathan . You think I don 't know who did this ? It was Linderman 's guys that ran me off the road . Are you sure ? That 's it , Dad ? That 's the best you got ? Am I sure ? You invite that man into our home . He tried to kill me , Dad ! Come on , stop . Heidi will never walk again ! Stop , stop . Stop . I 'm good . Heidi , it 's her spine . She broke her back . Oh , God . Oh , no . Mom . She just woke up and she 's asking for you . Come on . I 'm gonna hurt that man , and when I do , if you 're standing next to him , you 're gonna get hurt , too . Come on . Time to choose a side , Dad . Your client or your family . Nathan ? Any word ? I spoke with the neurologist . Her spine is broken in three places . It doesn 't look good . Arthur . What Nathan said about Linderman ... You can 't be serious . Come on , Angela . Linderman wouldn 't dare go after Nathan on his own . No , he wouldn 't . What are you asking ? Am I trying to kill my son ? Nathan 's an Assistant DA . There could 've been any one of 100 indicted criminals driving that van . I will not have this conversation . No , I know that . You 're right . But I need to hear you say it , Arthur . Did you order Linderman to kill Nathan ? No . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I love you , Arthur . I love you , too . There 's our man . You want me to light him up ? Negative . This is strictly a training mission . You 're here to watch and learn . No powers , unless I give the order . Danny Pine ? Who wants to know ? Jim Farrell , with the V.A. I just need a minute of your time , pal . My partner and I are trying to transition some of the homeless vets out here into affordable housing . We feel it 's a crime the way this country 's turned its back on you guys . What happened to Scofield ? Scofield ? The V.A. rep that was out here last week . Right . Oh , yeah , he was reassigned to Dallas . Farrell and I , we 're the new team now . That 's the story . Welcome to the Company . Hi . Do you like pie ? That rhymed , didn 't it ? Come on in . I 'm really glad you came , Elle . I wasn 't sure you would . I have been thinking about you and wondering how you 've been since ... Better . Great , actually . Thanks to you . I just decided to clean up this place , and all this clutter was filling my head with bad thoughts . Yeah . What 's this ? That 's just ... It 's just a list of people like me . Nice , single guys like you ? Maybe I should take this list . No , no . I 'm sorry , Elle . There 's something you should know about me . I have a kind of a power , an ability , that 's out of the ordinary . I don 't understand . Come here . Oh , my God . The other people on the list , they can do things , too . Wait . There are others ? What kind of pie did you bring ? Peach . That 's my favorite kind . Good work , Meredith . You were born for this . Yeah , so that 's it ? I 'm an agent now ? Not quite . Getting scum off the street , that 's the easy part . The real test is loyalty . You 're not gonna always agree with the decisions the Company makes , but when you prove you can follow orders , no questions asked , that 's when we 'll call you " Agent Gordon . " Put him in cell nine . Come on . Meredith ? Flint ? I thought you got away . Yeah , well , an invisible man tackled me in the alley . Are they gonna make you an agent also ? What ? What do you mean , " also " ? What did they tell you ? They 're gonna train me , Mer . I 'm gonna get to wear one of them suits and everything . Flint ... This is gonna be great , Mer . It 's gonna be you and me , working together . Is there a problem ? No , sir . Good . No problem at all . This is bag and tag , baby . Bag and tag . I can 't believe you can just lift your finger and move things . Must feel amazing . It does . But it can be overwhelming , too , like a drug that you can 't get enough of . How many others are there like you ? With abilities ? I don 't know . To be honest , I don 't want to know . I have a kind of problem . I guess you could say I 'm like an addict . I have this overwhelming hunger to ... I covet the powers of others . But somehow , since the other day , since meeting you , I feel like maybe I don 't have to be so special . Maybe I can just be Gabriel again . But you are special , Gabriel . You 're special just the way you are . " Special just the way you are . " I was afraid you were about to burst into song . I was just trying to win his trust . Well , we 're stalling out here . We need to kick it into high gear . I don 't think he 's going to kill again . I really think we should look into someone else on this list . No , we 're sticking with the plan . Mr. Gray is a killer . We know that . The only question is , will we witness the act , or will he do it in a dark alley somewhere ? But what if you 're wrong ? What if his suicide attempt was a wake-up call ? You like this guy . Isn 't that adorable ? You think he 's sweet , is that it ? What about this one ? Trevor Zeitlan ? I 'm not gonna do it . We need to see him kill . I 'm not going to do it . All right , if that 's how you feel . Here . Go ahead . Go on . New York City , you could , I don 't know , become a waitress ? We have orders , Elle . You don 't follow orders , you 're not an agent . You 're not an agent , you 're on your own . Your father has been training you for this since you were four years old . Come on . Let 's introduce Mr. Zeitlan to Mr. Gray . I 'm sorry , Arthur , I don 't know how he survived that crash . You know how badly you screwed this up ? Now Nathan 's out for blood . Maybe we should rethink this . I mean , a second attempt is bound to look suspicious , and who knows how Angela 's gonna react ? What do you suggest ? We abort ? No , no . Not abort . No . Postpone . You 're not thinking this through . The plan for New York has been years in the making . Do we postpone that , too ? No . No , not necessarily . I don 't know , Daniel , sometimes I worry you are outliving your usefulness . You know , you 're right , Arthur . We should finish this . I know a guy in Montreal . He worked for me in Vegas . He 's good . Now , I can fly him down tonight . Angela . Angela ! Angela ! It has to be done . Arthur , don 't . You know I 'm right . It has to be done . He 's my baby . Say it . My baby . Nathan has to die . It has to be done . Nathan has to die . Nathan has to die . Hiro ? Hiro ? Hiro , wake up . No , don 't wake him . Why ? What 's happening ? He 's trapped between this world and the next . If he wakes now he could be stuck like this forever . We have to do something . Here . Mix . Something has disturbed his dream time . Part of him wants to wake , but his spirit walk is not complete . Careful not to inhale the fumes . It 's working . Yes . Put your shoes on . What ? What 's going on ? There 's a train yard a half mile from here . We can catch a freight straight on into Houston . What are you talking about ? What about us being agents ? At least these people been nice to me . They 're tricking you because you 're dumb . You remember what Daddy used to say . " God gave you a big sister instead of a brain . " Put your shoes on . Now . Once we reach Houston , we 'll head straight on into Mexico . Fly under the radar for a little while , maybe we 'll work in a little cantina . Mexico sounds good . Flint . Flint , you got to understand something . You can 't ever trust the Company . They will lie to you , they 'll lock you up , or worse . You hear me , Flint ? You got to promise me that you 'll never , ever ... You killed her ! That 's right , genius , I killed her . Now I 'm gonna kill you . Flint , look out ! Son of a bitch . You were following me , huh ? Why did you have to screw this up ? Come on . Flint , an agent ? We could 've given him a purpose ! Now , he 's our sworn enemy . So am I ! That smells good . Almost as good as my pot pies . Daniel . I think Arthur 's downtown . Yes , he is . What 's on your mind ? The question is , Angela , what isn 't on yours ? Look , it wasn 't an easy decision to come . But , believe it or not , I still have a shred of morality left in me somewhere . I can no longer stand by and watch him destroy you like this . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I know he 's working on a project . I don 't remember the details right now , but I 'm sure it has to be done . I can 't push a thought into your head , Angela , but I can heal the scars . What scars ? For all the times he 's forced his thoughts , erased your memories , each time leaves its mark , a trace of damaged tissue . I don 't believe you . Arthur would never do that to me . Arthur is betraying you in the most heinous way possible . How dare you ? He 's gonna kill your son . You 're a liar . I can heal the scars , Angela . But you have to decide . Do you want to live in blind obedience or do you want to know the truth ? Nathan ! So , you never answered my question . Why do you hate the Company so much ? Because they killed my baby girl . It was 14 years ago . They caught up with me in this little village off the Panhandle . Stormed in at night . There was a firefight . The place went up like kindling . And my little girl , Claire , she was killed in the fire . Claire . That 's what they told you . She died in a fire . What is that supposed to mean ? Go . Go on before I change my mind . What ? Think of it as a " get out of jail free " card . For your little girl . Go . - The ziti smells terrific . - I can 't wait . Hey , have you ever been to that little theater down the street ? I saw that they had some sort of artsy spoken word thing there tonight . Maybe we should stop by later . Maybe we should . I invited someone to join us . I hope you don 't mind . It 's open . Yeah . I 'm Trevor . We spoke on the phone . I 'm Elle . And this is Gabriel . I thought you two should meet . Trevor has an ability , too . An ability ? I don 't understand . Don 't be mad , but I got Trevor 's number off that list you had . I really think it 's important for you to get to know people like yourself . I mean , alcoholics can 't do it alone . Trevor , why don 't you show us what you can do ? Okay . Wow . That is so cool . Gabriel , isn 't that special ? Wait here . I have a great idea . Soup is delicious . Italian lentil . Your mother 's recipe . Something on your mind ? What 's the matter , Arthur ? You can 't see inside it ? You just seem far away . I just wonder sometimes if without your power , you 'd know me at all anymore . Indigestion ? So , what do you think , Arthur ? Do you still know me ? Can you tell anything about me just by looking in my eyes ? You 're my wife , Angela . I know you like I know my own heart . Really ? So , what am I gonna do now ? Am I gonna kiss you , or am I gonna kill you ? I love that . Don 't you love that ? That 's great . It 's so special . Let 's see it again . You think he 's so special ? I bet he can 't do this . Gabriel ! I think you need to leave , now . Gabriel , don 't ! Please . How did you ... You don 't have to do this . Who are you ? Get out . We can 't do this . Bennet , we have to make him stop . This is incredible . He actually exposes the brain . Oh , my God . Our son , Arthur . Our own son . There are larger issues at stake , Angela . You can 't let sentimentality derail everything that we worked so hard for . I 'm sentimental because I don 't want to murder our son ? We were gonna rebuild the world . You were a great man , Arthur . You were a visionary , but somewhere along the line , you lost your soul . And I make no apology ... I lied . It 's not your mother 's recipe . Use the incinerator on Level 3 . Use my pass card to grant you access . Should anyone ask , he 's a casualty of a field op . Ma ? Nathan . Anybody home ? Ma ? Dad ! Oh , my God . I think he 's had a heart attack . Is he ... He 's still breathing . He 's still alive . We 're wrapped here . Just one more loose end . No , no . Not that thing . The other thing . I 'll let you know . Don 't beat yourself up . We 've done invaluable work here . Those tapes will be studied and analyzed ... We created a monster . We set him loose on the world . I wouldn 't worry too much about that . I get the feeling that we 'll be tracking down Mr. Gray again soon . That 's not the point ! He had a soul , Bennet . He could 've been saved . We 're not missionaries . If they had wanted us to bring him in , that would 've been the assignment . It wasn 't . We follow orders , Elle . We 're agents . That 's what we do . Now excuse me . My ride is here . Where to , my friend ? JFK , please . - We should call Peter . - Maybe we should wait . Until what ? Until we have something to tell him . I 'm sorry . He 's gone . He suffered a massive coronary brought on by anterior myocardial infarction . There was nothing we could do . Heart attack ? I 'd like a cremation as soon as possible . Why don 't you go home and get some rest ? We can deal with the paperwork in the morning . I can 't believe it . He 's dead . It 's done . Yes . I understand . She wants a cremation . I can procure another body , of course . I 'm afraid the poison caused irreversible damage to the peripheral nervous system . The paralysis will likely be permanent . I 'm sorry . He 's with Izzy now . Izzy ? Thank you . Thank you . Izzy . He hated that dog . Of course . It was the one living thing he met that ever disobeyed him . You remember when we would sit with Dad out here when we were kids , watch Izzy bury her bones ? Yeah . I can 't believe he 's gone . I know . Let 's not idolize your father because he 's dead . He wasn 't a god , he was a man . Deeply flawed in ways you will never know . No ! I understand you 've been dreaming about me . Hiro !

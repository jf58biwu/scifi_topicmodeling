 TOPHER : Would you like a treatment ? ( SIGHING ) I was just sitting because I 'm tired . Life of a Handler is pretty exhausting . - Better you than me . You just off shift ? - For a few hours . Can 't really seem to sleep , though . - It 's hard to imagine Echo being ... - Did you touch this ? ( TOPHER SIGHS ) I didn 't ... It 's not a toy , Ballard . Leave the tech to the grownups , okay ? So , Echo . - It 's good , right ? - It 's different . Not the romance . The other protocol . I 'm not gonna lie to you . I kind of blew my own mind this time . One special client request , one minor change to Echo 's bodily functions , and I just opened up a whole new world for us . - It 's all still new to me . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . But this ... I made code for the brain that changed the physical body . And I 'm not talking about muscle memories so somebody can play fancy piano . I made changes on a glandular level . Do you have any idea what this could mean ? Explain it to me . Well , arguably , one could program the brain to ... Fight cancer . Or be telekinetic . Or not to have that gag reflex when you eat sea urchin , or whatever . The possibilities are pretty much endless , is what I 'm saying . I don 't want to use the word " genius , " but I 'd be okay if you wanted to . So you could do all that to me with this chair ? Well , not you . To an Active . I can 't fiddle with the mind until it 's wiped clean . The human mind is like Van Halen . If you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it , it just degenerates . Yeah . I don 't understand . But it 's so cute that you 're trying . Mmm . Okay , good talk . Huh ? Yeah . Say hi to Echo for me . Tell her we 're all very proud . I thought I heard you . ( GURGLING ) Yeah . Don 't wake Daddy . Come here . Yeah . Hush , little baby , don 't say a word Mama ' s gonna buy you a mocking bird And if that mocking bird don 't sing Mama ' s gonna buy you a diamond ring ( JACK CRYING ) Okay , little man , Mommy needs to mainline some caffeine , so you just chill there for one sec . Babe , you want coffee ? Nate , you in there ? Whoa ! Good morning . You 're up early . Everything all right ? - Yeah , it 's fine . I 'm good . - Okay . I said good morning . Jack and I were gonna go to the park today and feed the duckies . Well , that sounds fun . You guys should do that . - You could play hooky and join us . - Yeah . I don 't think so . ( JACK CRYING ) Could you grab him while I finish the coffee ? - I don 't ... - Yeah . Here . You 're not gonna break him . He 's not gonna bite you or spontaneously combust . You got a Masters degree in Engineering , babe . - This should be a piece of cake . - Okay , I 'm sorry . I don 't ... You know , - I 'm gonna be late for work . - Nate , wait . - Will you be home for dinner ? - No , I 've got that apprentice thing . You shouldn 't wait up . Bye . Then he was supposed to take Jack for a play-date with the neighbors , and at the last minute he 's got another meeting , as usual . Nate 's a workaholic . - Em , he 's always been that way . - It 's more than that . It 's like I hand him the baby and he acts like I 've handed him a live grenade . Well , men are all wusses . He 's the one who pushed having kids right away . I wanted to wait a couple of years . Well , tell him he has to help out . You can 't raise this baby alone . He helps . Changes the diapers , shops , does the laundry . - He 's even read all the books . - Okay , now I just want to swap . ( SIGHS ) I can 't believe how much I love this little boy , and I don 't even know if Nate likes him . - Or me , for that matter . - Nate 's crazy about you . I think he 's having an affair . Em , when was the last time you had a full night 's sleep ? I don 't even remember . You 're exhausted . Your hormones are all over the place . This isn 't hormones . He 's never home . He works all day , and almost every night he 's got dinner or drinks . And then when he is home , he 's always taking phone calls outside - so that I don 't hear what he 's saying . - That doesn 't mean affair . - Well , maybe he 's doing something illegal . - What ? Why would you think that ? I 've noticed this black van parked outside the house every day . - I think we 're being watched . - No one is watching you , Emily . You 're sleep-deprived and it 's making you a little nuts . Look , some guys take a little longer to get used to the idea of being a dad . But it gets better . - Are you sure ? - I 'm positive . Besides , Nate isn 't the type to sleep around . What you need is a night of uninterrupted sleep . Make Nate take the baby tonight , have a glass of wine , put some earplugs in and give yourself a break . Things will work out , I promise . I 'm so lucky to have you in my life , Kelly . I 'd go completely crazy without you . That 's what I 'm here for . And you 're right . I 'm not obsessing about this anymore . I 'm just gonna give Nate his space and let him figure it out himself . We 're just gonna find out what Daddy 's up to , aren 't we , baby boy ? Yes we are ! And if he 's got nothing to hide , he won 't mind if I go through all his stuff , will he , baby boy ? No . No , he won 't . Hello ? Anybody home ? Emily , are you here ? ( GASPS ) - Jeez . You ... - Who is she ? - Where 's Jack ? - He 's asleep in his room , and you still haven 't answered my question . - Who the hell is she , Nate ? - How did you ... - You 're not supposed ... - I knew it . I knew you were having an affair . You went into my office . That 's private . That 's my private stuff . Private ? This is where you and I went on our honeymoon . Tell me who she is ! I knew her before I knew you , and I was in love with her . - Son of a bitch . - But then she died . And it was very painful for me , and it took a long time for me to get over it . And in some ways , I 'll never be over it . But I shouldn 't have kept that from you . That was wrong . I 'm sorry . - You should have told me . - I know . You 're right . It was a mistake . This was all a terrible mistake . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have gone completely mental on you . I should 've just talked to you like a normal person . I 've just been so tired . Why don 't you go to bed ? Right now . I 'll take Jack tonight . That 's the least I can do . And we 'll talk tomorrow , okay ? Okay . Thank you . Things will be better in the morning . NATE : How can you be sure ? I will not ! This is a disaster . I 'm the one who has to ... No . You people promised me something that you cannot deliver . This is not working . I am calling it off . Get rid of her . I 'll get rid of the baby . ( GASPS ) I think I might have made a mistake . You think I jumped the gun ? - CIND Y : Which gun ? - Press conference . I was hoping when we went public , witnesses would come forward . What about the man with the tinfoil hat ? Didn 't he say Rossum mailed his liver to Saturn ? Well , right now , he 's our star . We have anecdotal evidence that Rossum and the other big meds are performing illegal medical procedures and unlicensed experiments . But that 's all it is . Anecdotal . - You have a source at the NSA ? - Had . - Like everyone else , he 's gone to ground . - Well , you have their financials . That 's a lot of unaccounted cash transactions for medical research . Won 't be hard to prove money laundering . - This is nice . - Focus . You are foil-hat man 's only hope . ( DOORBELL RINGS ) Sit . I got it . I 'm not after money laundering . Rossum crossed a line . And they 've gotta be leaning on people to keep them quiet . They 've got the resources . Cindy ? There was nobody there . ( DOORBELL RINGS ) Good morning , Madeline . May I come in ? - The place looks lovely . - I stripped a lot of it back to the original . Work is good ? You know , I haven 't worked a day since I 've been home . - God bless you , my dear . - I should feel guilty about that . - I really , really don 't . - Absolutely not . Do you know how many people would kill to have this kind of freedom ? It 's strange . I never thought I 'd be among the idle rich . You should travel . You 're allowed to leave the country , you know ? I don 't think so . I 've been away so long , part of me just wants to stay close to home . Is there a young man keeping you close to home ? - Maybe . I 'm not sure . - I thought as much . Do tell . Adelle , don 't misunderstand . It 's nice to see you , but I have this irrational fear that if I say one wrong thing , men in suits are going to throw me in a black van and take me away . Not at all . Your obligation to the Dollhouse is complete . Right . So you 're just here for a friendly chat ? You haven 't come in for your diagnostic . Just because you leave our care , we don 't cast you to the wolves , Madeline . - I 'm worried about you . - I appreciate that . I suspect you 're also worried that I 'll flip out and expose you and the Dollhouse ? Well , the two worries aren 't mutually exclusive . You know what I 'm wondering ? If this is really about the fact that you let me out of my contract early . Years early . Why is that ? Did something happen ? Circumstances changed . I 'm not at liberty to discuss them . For your own wellbeing , come and have your diagnostic . - I won 't take no for an answer . - No . I don 't imagine you will . Hey , where you two going ? Just for a walk . A walk outside . We 'll be right back . Yeah ? You 're holding your car keys . We 're going to the park in the car and then for a walk . Oh . You know , I thought that we could all eat breakfast together . I just discovered that I can actually cook something called scrambled eggs , and I don 't want to brag , but they 're pretty amazing . You know , that sounds so great , but I 'm not hungry . - Aren 't you supposed to be at work ? - Yeah , I took the day off . - That 's great , babe . - Yeah . It 's long overdue . - I forgot . You can 't drive anywhere today . - Why not ? Well , I took your car to the shop to get the brake pads replaced , and I forgot the baby seat inside . I 'm sorry . Your car will be ready tomorrow . - You didn 't need to do that , Nate . - I know . I was just trying to help out . You know what ? Why don 't you go back to bed and I 'll take this little guy ? Get some rest . - Wait , wait . No , no . - No , no , no . It 's okay . Go on . We 're gonna have a little man time down here . It 's time for him to eat . I forgot . But I should feed him . - Yeah . - All right . Just , why don 't you take a nap when you 're done ? Promise . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Okay . Baby , it 's okay . It 's okay . ( PHONE DIALING ) Okay . - SIERRA : Hello ? - Kelly . - You have to come get me and the baby . - What 's wrong ? Nate won 't let us leave . I think he 's trying to kill me . Emily , that 's crazy . He took away the car . Just please come and get us . - I 'll explain everything . - All right . All right . I 'm on my way . Thank you . It 's okay . ( CAR APPROACHING ) Thank God . No . No . Oh , God . Oh , God . NATE : She 's upstairs . PAUL : Husband says she 's been acting a little paranoid and she has the kid with her , so let her see me first . We don 't want this to get out of hand . ( JACK GURGLING ) ECHO : Please be quiet . Please don 't cry . Please . Don 't cry . - Jack . - Mrs. Jordan ? Would you like a treatment ? Please be quiet , Jack . - Come on , it 's okay . - What the hell ? Don 't cry . Please don 't cry . Jack , it 's okay . Don 't cry , please . Don 't cry . ( CAR ENGINE STARTING ) You gotta be kidding me . It 's okay , baby boy . We 're gonna be okay . - Please sit down , Mr. Jordan . - I will not sit down . Your zombie took my Jack , and you are sitting there drinking tea . - Do something ! - Echo will not harm your child . She loves him . She is his mother . I 'm sorry . Are you listening to yourself ? She is not his mother . But she is , Mr. Jordan . This isn 't someone playing make-believe . In Echo 's mind , she planned for this child , carried him for nine months , delivered him and nursed him . For all intents and purposes , Jack is her baby . I gave you people money , a lot of money , and you send a crazy kidnapping chick into my house . - What the hell did I pay you for ? - A mother . You could 've hired a nanny , a babysitter , but you wanted someone to bond profoundly with your child , because you could not bond with him yourself , which is understandable . I shouldn 't have done this . This was a terrible idea . The formative months of an infant 's life are crucial . A child who feels loved is imprinted with a sense that the world is a safe place . A child that does not feel loved grows up to be ... Well , most likely a sociopath . What happens to a child kidnapped by a stranger ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Jordan , but your next plan was to put up the child for adoption , was it not ? Just find him . We know exactly where Echo and the baby are , and we are retrieving them as we speak . We 're just hitting the bank , taking out as much of Daddy 's money as they will let us , and then you and I are road-tripping it , sweetheart . Won 't that be fun ? Officers . Officers . Please help me . Someone 's chasing me . They 're trying to take away my baby . - Where ? - It 's ... Damn it . They were right there . I swear . You have to believe me . My husband 's trying to have me killed . You 're safe now . Come with us . I know it sounds crazy . I listen to myself and I sound crazy . But I heard him . My husband wants to take my baby and get me killed . It doesn 't make any sense . I don 't know what I did . The important thing is , you came to us . Too many women convince themselves they 're overreacting , or pretend things will get better . Then it 's too late . You have to understand . He 's not an abuser . He 's never laid a hand on me . He doesn 't even raise his voice . - I 'm not a victim . - Yeah , not yet . Let 's try to keep it that way . You had a baby . Some guys can 't handle the stress . - They snap . - He didn 't snap . He just went away , you know ? It 's like the person I knew isn 't there anymore . He 's been replaced by a stranger . - I don 't even know what I 'm saying . - Yes , you do . And you 're lucky you got out when you did . - What 's gonna happen now ? - We 'll formally record your statement , then we 'll bring your husband in for questioning . In the meantime , we 'll get a judge to grant you a restraining order . That 's him . Oh , God , that 's him . And that 's one of the men that came into my house . DETECTIVE : They 're talking to my captain . Don 't worry . You 're safe . Stay put . I 'll see what 's going down . ( INAUDIBLE ) You can 't hurt me in here , Nate . Whatever you 've got planned , it 's not gonna work . - You sure about this , Mr. Jordan ? - I am positive . - That is my baby , but that is not my wife . - No one 's gonna hurt you , Emily . This man is from the FBI . He just wants to talk to you , okay ? Stay away from me . Stay away from me . All of you . - I promise , you 'll be safe . - Don 't come any closer . No . No . No ! No , don 't take my baby ! No ! Don 't take my baby ! Don 't ! Don 't ! No ! - Jack ! - It 's okay . I don 't want to hurt you ! - Jack ! Jack ! - No , no . Don 't fight . - Jack ! - It 's okay . I 'm not gonna hurt you ! Don 't ! Don 't take him ! Let me go ! Let me go , let me go , let me go , please ! Don 't take him ! Jack ! Don 't take him ! Jack ! Jack ! Seventy-two , 65 , 58 , 51 . Thank you . Repeat these words . Boat , cucumber , wire . - Boat , cucumber , wire . - Very good . - Any headaches , dizziness ? - None . - Nightmares , déjà vu ? - No . - Gag reflex while eating sea urchin ? - What ? Forget it . So , I 'm not broken ? You 're not glitching , and I haven 't found any phantom files or random memory threads . - Physiologically , you 're intact . - So I 'm finished then ? What were those three words I asked you to repeat ? - Boat , cucumber , wire . - Clean bill of health . Factory-new and not a scratch on you , as promised . We should put you in the recruiting DVD . Thank you very much . So , how do I get out of here ? I 'll let them know that you 're ready to be taken home . Hey , while we 're waiting , may I offer you any additional enhancements ? On the house . I 've been working on some pretty sick apps . - How do you feel about ventriloquism ? - So tempting . I 'll have to pass . - Well , it 's a dying art . - No ! Let go of me ! Give me back my son ! Give me back my son ! - Little help ? - TOPHER : Get her in the chair ! Get her ... - They stole my baby ! Help me ! - Did you offer her a treatment ? - Gee , that 's a great idea , Topher ! - Why won 't anybody help me ? No ! No , no , no , no ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! No ! Let me go ! No ! No ! ( GROANS ) You knocked her out ? No . I can 't wipe her when she 's knocked out . Think ! Okay . Just come on . Put her in the chair . I 'll wipe her when she wakes up , whenever that is . - What are you doing here ? - Just came in for a diagnostic . - Wow . That was really intense . - You 're bleeding . - I remember you . - You do ? My last day here , when I was signing the paperwork . Oh . Right . Come on . Let 's get that taken care of . - Looks good . Don 't even need a stitch . - Thanks . - You okay ? - I don 't know . To be clear , nobody took anybody 's baby . She 's an Active . Like you used to be . It was all pretend . - Is it always like that ? - Like what ? She really believed someone took her child . - Heart and soul . - Like I said , it wasn 't real . But it was for her . All that emotion . All that pain . Was I ever like that ? - We 're not good for each other . - Stop being so cruel . - Can 't you see this is killing me ? - You 'll get over it . You know , I 'm kind of new here . I ... I wouldn 't really know . She 'll be okay . - Who ? - The girl . You seemed worried for her . She 'll forget about the baby . She 'll forget everything . No more pain . No more grief . - That 's how it works . - They did it for me . I had a daughter . She died . I 'm sorry . She had a cold , and then it wasn 't a cold . It was cancer . Terminal . And my world fell apart . Within six months , she was gone and I was left all alone , completely unable to function . - I had no idea . - How could you ? But what I 'm telling you is , it all worked out . I met Adelle . She came to you ? She told me I didn 't have to suffer anymore . I 'd go to sleep for five years . I 'd wake up without pain . So , what ? You 're happy now ? I 'm not sad . It was nice meeting you . You seem like a nice man . Please help me . They 're gonna do something terrible to my little boy . I am a nice man . You 're gonna be just fine . I promise . I 'm gonna make all this go away . - So you 'll help me ? - Absolutely . No ! Jack ! I 'll get rid of the baby . Hello , Echo . How are you feeling ? - Did I fall asleep ? - For a little while . Shall I go now ? PERRIN : God . - CIND Y : What is it ? - Wiretap transcripts . This is more than just medical malfeasance or ethics violations . This is prostitution , human trafficking , maybe murder . They take people and they change them into whatever they want them to be . - That 's not possible . - It 's very possible . I read everything about this when Mom was sick . Rossum had the means to help her , and instead they ... Okay . You know , when we first started looking into this , I thought this was a game-changer for us , a trophy , the next step up in your career . I 'm scared , Daniel . The power that these people have ... - Do you want me to back off ? - No . No , I want you to do what you promised . This has to stop . We 're gonna verify all this . We 're gonna find proof . We 've got better than proof . We 've got a name . Go , please . What precisely was the last thing she said to you ? I 'm telling you , I remember wiping her , and then my face exploded . That 's it . Where is she going ? GPS has her heading to ... Nate Jordan 's house . She 's going after the baby . How can that be ? You were supposed to have wiped her . I did . I 'm sure of it . Are we looking at another composite event , Mr. Brink ? I don 't think so . I think we 're looking at a genius . I 'm not as comfy with you saying that as I thought I 'd be . Think about it . You changed her on a glandular level . Maybe her body was stronger than her brain . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . The maternal instinct is the purest . It 's too strong for a normal wipe . I outplayed myself . - It 's like in chess . - Not like chess . Like Echo is in trouble and pain because you didn 't think it through . She probably can 't even remember his name , but she has to have him back , no matter what . Perhaps triggering lactation was a bridge too far . - Live and learn . - Go . Now . Hi . Well , I guess that 's gonna hold . What do you think ? You had a crazy day , huh , buddy ? But things are gonna be okay . You and me , we 're gonna figure it out . Whoa . Come here , pal . Okay . All right . All right , I 'm going to see about getting a bottle together for you , okay ? Now , don 't you go anywhere . Don 't you go anywhere . All right . Daddy will be right back . ( EX CLAIMS ) Smells like fish . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Damn it . Damn it . ( JACK CRYING ) Hold on , buddy . I 'll be right there . - Hello ? - Mr. Jordan , Adelle DeWitt . It is imperative you and your son leave your house at once . What ? Why ? There 's little time for discussion . Our Active is on her way to you . I 've dispatched a team to intercept . Get out of the house immediately , Mr. Jordan . She 's coming here ? Why ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Jack ? ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) No . No . Jack ? Jack ? Jack ? Jack ! Where are you ? Mommy 's home . - Please . Don 't hurt him . - You took away my baby . - Why did you do that ? - I 'm sorry . Can ... Can I please have him back ? I love him . I don 't want to give him to you . - I 'm his daddy . - But this is my baby . - I know that you think that he is . - I want you to go away now . I can 't do that . - Babies need their mothers . - I know . - But you aren 't his mother . - That 's a lie . - I don 't want to talk to you anymore . - I know that you love Jack very much , but he doesn 't belong to you , and I 'm afraid that you 're gonna hurt him . That 's not me . That 's not right . Okay . Do you remember ? They turned you into somebody else . You 're not real . - None of this is real . - I 'm not real . Do you know who 's real ? No . I don 't . And I 'm sorry . This is my fault . I put you through hell . They made you love Jack because I asked them to . Why did you do that ? My wife , Karen , she died while having Jack , and I couldn 't handle it , and I fell apart and I blamed him . I blamed a baby . Do you believe that ? And after she died , I needed to find someone who would love Jack , because I couldn 't do it myself . So can I be his mommy ? No . I 'm sorry . You can 't . Karen is a part of Jack . You aren 't . And he 's all that I have left of her anymore , so ... You can do whatever you want to do to me . Just please don 't hurt the baby . ( GURGLING ) My little boy . ( SIGHS ) It 's okay . Are you okay ? I had a baby . Now I don 't have him anymore . I feel sad . I 'm sorry . All of these things that happen to me , I feel them . I know , Echo . I know you remember everything . Not remember . Feel . I was married . I felt love . Pain , fear . It 's not pretend for me . They made me love my little boy , and then they took him away . They make it so real . Every time , they make it so real . Why do they do that ? I know you want to help me bring down the Dollhouse , but maybe it 's too much . I can do this on my own . I promise I 'll get you out . I 'll get all of you out . If you want , I 'll tell Topher what 's going on with you , and he can fix it . He 'll come up with a way to wipe you and you won 't remember a thing . You won 't have to feel sad anymore . Feeling nothing would be worse . That would be like before . Asleep . I 'm awake now . I don 't want to go back to sleep . English - US - SDH Ripped by stlc8tr

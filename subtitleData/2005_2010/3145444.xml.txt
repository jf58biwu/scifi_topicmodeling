Light for a Thursday but expect some congestion downtown ... due to the arrival of visiting Chinese minister of foreign affairs ... 6 : 30 a. m ? Thursday ? I don 't understand . It 's not the first time you 've lived this day . Now , keep your mouth shut . I 've got to take this call . - Hello ? - Is everything set for today , Phillip ? Mother , please . The job will get done . - I told you not to worry . - You know how important this is . Something 's come up I need to take care of . Oh ? I 've got it under control . Would you please try and have some faith in me ? Then I 'll see you tonight , to celebrate our victory . I 'll be there for dinner . - You always listen to your mother ? - Shut up . Give it here .

No ! - Call Riley . - Copy that . I got to go . So if the day is completely replayed ... how come I can remember everything that 's happened ? Because you were holding on to me when I re-racked . No one else will recall living this day , including your little commando team . That explains Connor 's button . - How far back can you go ? - The beginning of the current day . Once a day 's over , it 's over . I 'm not god . But it is close . My turn . Who are you people ? Why are you trying to kill Zhan Quan ? Answering a question with a question . Guess you 're going to die never knowing . Hi . It 's okay . Straight to voice mail . Vasco , if nothing 's wrong with you , I 'm gonna kill you myself . What the hell happened to you ? Take too long to explain . I know what Dyle 's power is . He can re-rack time . Replay the same day over and over . That 's a pretty wild theory . You called the briefing to tell us that Dyle rented a downtown office ... on the route of the Chinese foreign minister , Zhan Quan . You couldn 't know that . Unless you already told me . Which you did . The last time we started this day . Joe 's going to short out a wire and the light 's going to blow . Damn ! I 'm all right . Guess I should 've thrown the circuit breaker . - How did you ... ? - In two seconds , Riley 's going to enter soaking wet . Didn 't you get splashed by a truck ? - No , but this girl I just met did . - Close enough . How 'd you know that ? The last time we lived this day I called Riley . This time , I didn 't get the call about the briefing , somebody else must 've called him . Yeah , I did . Everything 's just a little off . Sorry I 'm late . Connor , hold up your right arm . Huh ? You got a button missing on your cuff . Yeah , I just noticed . The Neuro can restart the day . - As many times as he needs to . - We don 't remember anything , - ... what 's different ? - How do you know all this . - What 're you talking about ? - Long story . We 've got to get downtown . Dyle 's going to try it again . Connor . What the heck is going on ? You 're asking me . Be careful ... The whole intersection is going to erupt in flames . If you say so . Run it ! Flames , huh ? Dyle must 've changed something . Riley , Zhang 's ETA ? Two minutes . I 've got a satellite thermal image of someone in the rented office . He 's cut power to the elevator . The stairwell 's the only way up but it 's booby-trapped . I 'll take the lead . Zhang 's ETA to intersection , 20 seconds . That jack-ass stole my Vespa . - Where is he ? - I don 't know . Hey ! Untie me ! Shut up . Point blank . Zhang never had a chance . Yeah . Gotcha . One of the networks acquired cell phone footage ... of the assassination taken by a civilian . They just ran it . Unfortunately , we got to watch it live . Great . Everyone 's gonna see our screw-up over and over again , all day long . Homeland security , they 've elevated the threat level to orange . DoD gave the alert to the military , world-wide . Even if we hunt this guy down and chip him , it 's not gonna lessen the political crisis . The info I gave you on Dyle 's apartment lead to anything ? Yep . The place was rented last week , under an alias . I ran a search and came up with a cell phone , activated the same day , same address . Can you track the cell phone ? Yeah . When were you gonna tell us ? Gimme a break , it just popped up on the grid the moment you walked in . He 's still in town . Ten blocks away from where the hit took place . Well , let 's go get him . Should I notify the FBI and metro police ? - No . - No . Nobody should do a thing , until we think this through . If Vasco is right and we 're reliving every day over and over again , we get near Dyle and try to chip him , all he 's going to do is rewind the day . And we start from scratch . But if Dyle rewinds the day , doesn 't that mean Zhang will be alive ? Again ? Riley , you 're a genius ! - Well , we knew that . - We can work this . Ok , please , is someone gonna clue me in here ? Right now Dyle thinks I 'm dead . Why does he think you 're dead ? Because he unloaded his gun into me . According to Riley , he hasn 't been back to his apartment . Which means he still thinks I 'm there . I 'm lost . If we can force Dyle to replay the day , I can nail him . Dyle 's already hit his target . He has no reason to replay the day . Let 's give him one . Dyle 's at his apartment now . How did you get this number ? Your mother gave it to me . Mother .. ? Who the hell are you people ? What do you want ? Revenge . Say goodbye to your mother . Do what you have to , Phillip ! Don 't let them stop you ! Nooo ! Vasco better be right about this . They don 't understand . I can bring mother back . Just jump back into the morning and she 'll be alive . They don 't understand . I can bring mother back . Jane ? - Yeah . - Hey . I got a lead on our Neuro . Briefing at 7 : 00 . - Call Connor and Riley . - No need to . What ? Seth got a Neuro-positive test on Dyle . Riley found out he rented a downtown office . And you think he 's going to assassinate the Chinese foreign minister . It 's not going to happen . How could you possibly know that ? - Because I just chipped him . - Where are you ? Dyle 's apartment . I 'll explain when you get here . And tell Joe to be careful . He should throw the circuit breaker before he works on the wiring . Damn ! Some neurons exploit their powers in a negative way , but the ability to do things over , keep trying until you get it right , can be used in a positive way . What 's so funny ? How does a guy like Riley get anywhere with a babe like that ? Persistence . - Maybe you could learn a thing or two . - Yeah , right . Come here , you 're buying .

I agree , so why fight it ? - This as good as blue nun ? - Oh , no.Let me take that . - I 'll get you something better . - Oh , no.It 's okay . I 'm just going to take it to my room .

We actually have a date , so I got to get going . Oh . - Where 's he taking you ? - Home.He 's cooking me dinner . I shipped zack off to a friend 'S . Anyone can cook , but will he clean up , too ? Okay , okay , we 're just being mean now because we 're jealous . Katie , dan is a keeper . Yeah.I think so , too . - Have a good time . - Bye , guys . So , she saw her mother having sex with another man ? Yeah , and I sent her into the fire . When I was 14 , i walked in on my dad taking a shower , and I couldn 't see colors for nine days . You got off easy . Abby disappeared . I read in the archives that she was last seen hitchhiking in ' 73 . Well , maybe that means you 're not done with her . Isn 't that how this works ? Uh , I hope not . Cheers . I took it to the ' 70s . Maybe you should have left it there . so , um , did you see livia at the swinger 's party ? What did you guys do ? Talk . You went to a swinger 's party and all you did was talk ? That and watch the nixon " I am not a crook " speech on the news . It was a rush to see it on the day that it actually happened . Honey , I love that you went to a wife-swapping party and it was nixon that turned you on . So , what , that was it , just orientation ? I report to work for real at 10 : 00 A.M.On tuesday . They 've got me on the board of supervisors beat . You 're going to kill . I 'd settle for not getting fired .

For the first time in weeks , I feel ... - normal . - That 's good . - It won 't last , I know . - Enjoy it . right here ? Yeah . Right here . Thanks for coming in.This won 't take long . Can 't think of a better way of spending my lunch hour than getting grilled by the fbi about a 30-year-old hijacking . Department policy mandates we audit your incident reports because of your brother 's involvement with mccleen 's ransom money . Why ? We have to make sure there 's no pattern of prior conflicts . - Oh , come on . - Can 't ia handle this ? We 're the feds , inspector . Rock beats scissors . All right , just do me a favor and let me be the one to tell my brother . It 'd be nice if it worked that way , wouldn 't it ? Police : Yong Woman Last seen in Green Pikup Abigail Armstrong 's abandoned Gremlin , Photo cc Palp Alto , Jan.2 How 'd your dinner go ? Good.The wine , not so much . And your promised candlestick point follow-up ? Skedline 's ten minutes away . Okay . Excuse me ? I 'm looking for dan vasser ? You found him . Hi.Richard garrity.I 'm with the fbi . Sorry to bother you at work . Can I ask yousome questions ? Sure . So , what 's this about ? Hijacking of a commercial airliner in 1975 . - Dylan mccleen ? - Yes . I was doing a story on him , but it didn 't pan out . So , why were you doing a story on a hijacking that 's 32 years old ? Because dylan mccleen hijacked a plane and jumped out with a parachute and 100 grand and was never seen again . It 's a great story . Or maybe you found the ransom money . - What 's that ? - You tell me . Are you saying this is ransom money from the hijacking ? I didn 't say anything . - Where 'd you get it ? - From your brother . - So , where did he get it ? - From you . I don 't recall giving him any money . Unless you 're talking about losing on a round of golf . Lying to a federal agent brings a serious degree of consequence . Then maybe I should get a lawyer . Two months ago they turned around a 747 because of a security breach ... yeah , I vanished off the plane in mid-flight . I do that from time to time . - To test airport security ? - What ? Maybe you were doing a run-through for a possible hijacking . - I think it 's time that I lawyer up . - Sure , here are the talking points . Why are you so interested in dylan mccleen ? Why do you have a bill with a serial number that 's linked to the ransom money , and why did a 747 get turned around in mid-flight that you were supposed to be on ? You got a warrant for my arrest ? No , but I have six federal judges on speed dial . All right , where is it ? High enough so a kid can 't reach it . You think jack would turn you in ? Well , it looks that way . - Did you call him ? - Not yet . What 's this ? Oh , her office sent it to me when they cleared outher desk . - And you kept it . - Yeah . It 's her law school diploma , personal stuff . Seemed wrong to throw it out . Maybe you can give it back to her . We got bigger problems right now , katie . Got it . Oh , okay.So , what are you gonna do with this ? Burn it . - hello . - Dan ? - Yeah ? - It 's elliott langley . - Did I catch you at a bad time ? - No . You able to meet me at cafe luna in ten minutes ? I don 't have much time . Uh , sure.Sure. Who was that ? A source that 's ready to talk.I 'll be back . Yep.Heard that one before . Dr.Langley ? - Hello , dan . - Sorry , I got here as fast ... not a problem . - How 's your book coming ? - Good . It 's an illuminating process . What are you doing now ? Lecturing twice a week at usf.We 're discussing quartz now . - Quartz . - Sand.Silicon dioxide . One of the most common minerals on the planet . I see . - You called me ? - I did . Are you finding that other people are interested in your work ? As a matter of fact , yes . Men with guns always want to control the men with ideas . Is that why you left that think tank ... - thurn-tippett , was it ... ? - Yes . The patriot act made my research at thurn accessible to the government . They rationalized that in a time of war , they needed access to anything that could help defeat terrorism . Defeat terrorism ? What are you working on ? Something the fbi might be interested in ? Just don 't tell anyone about your book . Even a novelist has to worry about losing intellectual property . - good night , dan . - Good night . We 're okay.Thanks. Before you take off the flat , you should check your spare . Okay . Well , you don 't have a spare . Damn . This car is cursed . Where you heading ? Back east to school.Maybe. Well , looks like you 're walking . This must be karma . Or maybe you just forgot the spare . I 've had a really bad month . there must be a reason for this.I 'm being taught something . What 's happened ? I had a falling out with my parents . - Oh , yeah , how ? - I 'll spare you the details . Let 's just say my mother has lousy taste in men . No tennis lessons , crockpots , or diet pills for me . Sorry ? Nothing . My life has changed its course and I 'm just gonna go with it . Well , sometimes you don 't have a choice . Yeah . What about you ? Ah , you know , I 'm just trying to get home . You 're good . - hey . - Hi . - Dude smells like bacon . - Yeah . Where you heading ? She 's going to the closest gas station . What 's the date ? - The 20th . - What year ? 1973 . - ' 74 . - 1974 . I don 't think he 's a cop . We 're heading to winterland . Neil young 's playing . What do you think ? Kind of out there . You know what ? I think you 're better off with them . - Are you gonna come ? - No.I 'm headed in the opposite direction . What 's your name ? Abigail . - But I like abby . - So do I. well , uh , thanks for talking with me . Um , see you down the road . katie ? Katie ... ? I didn 't know garrity was coming to see you . - Get out of here , jack . - Dan , let 's let him finish . I didn 't search your house for money . Zack brought the money out ... and so you launched an investigation ? There was a bag of brand-new $ 100 bills from 30 years ago . I-I asked our money guy about a single $ 100 bill . He took it , he entered it into the system and the serial numbers tripped the feds , okay . And once they got involved , I had to cooperate . - I can 't risk lying to a federal agent . - Let 's just keep this civil , okay.Zack 's sleeping . You stole money from my house and you took it to your lab to analyze . Yeah , and you 've been lying to me , danny . - Guys ... - I mean if you 're in trouble , if you 're in over your head with people you owe money to ... I 'm not in trouble , jack . Then tell me where the money came from . - No . - I 'm not an eagle scout , danny . I 'll give you cover if you tell me the truth . But if your lies take me down , I will cut you loose . I 've already told you the truth when I told you about livia back then . And you did that , which means you 're never gonna believe me . So , I 'm gonna tell you again . Get the hell out of my house ! Sure . Dan ... I don 't want to hear you defend him anymore . Do you understand ? I 'm sorry about last night . I-I got too angry . I just didn 't want it to escalate , is all . I know . I gotta go.I 'm late . good morning . I have a warrant to search the premises . Hey . Hey . Hey ! Don 't you guys have sleeper cells you should be worrying about ? Daring humor for a man on a no-fly list . Forgetting something ? Hold it there.I need to look in that briefcase . A briefcase is an " on-person " item . We have bags listed in warrant , so we can search it ... not if it 's locked.You need a separate warrant ... true , but we can confiscate it . I can keep going . - Thank you . - Thank you . - So , we 'll see you tonight . - Yeah . - I love you . - I know hey , you need an invitation ? Take a seat . All right . a letter was delivered to the office of the secretary of state in washington . This is a replica of it . It read in its entirety , " I hereby resign " the office of president of the united states . Sincerely , richard nixon . " - There was more ... - hey . Okay , I 'm lost . Do you remember abby from the swingers party ? I put her on a bus with them . I was saying ... each individual is complicated and has different needs . Anyone who thinks they only need one partner is cutting himself off from beautiful experiences with multi-dimensional souls . No reason we shouldn 't have multiple lovers in this world . Women aren 't chattel , sammy . All I 'm saying is there is plenty of me to go around . - Something amusing over there ? - Not at all . - He looks familiar . - There she is . - hello , abby . - Do I know you ? We met at your folks . My name is not abby.It 's angela . You dropped out of school ? Apparently , yeah . How 's it going ? I 'm great . - My life is great . - Hey , get your feet in . People are walking here . so where you heading ? Don 't know yet . What 's your bag ? You got a job ? You drop out ? - I 'll take this one . - Go ahead . We 're time travelers . Mo says he 's from the middle ages . And no joke , guess what it 's called . The high middle ages . Yes , the high middle ages . hey , check it out . Crystals . Quartz . Quartz crystals keep time better than any other substance that we have on the planet . - So what about you guys ? - What year you from ? - 2007 . - Cool . Neil young 's still playing . But , uh , winterland 's gone . Mo , they 're full of it . Let 's split . abby You don 't have to go with them . - You can come with us . - Where ? Now , angela . - I 'm not ready to jump off just yet . - Listen , abby - Let her go . - Hey ! Hey , Damn it ! - where is he ? - Jack , you shouldn 't be here . He was serious this time.He doesn 't want to talk to you . I 'm not looking for dan.I 'm looking for garrity.Where is he ? Probably going through my underwear right now . - Did you call your lawyer ? - No . - Why not ? - Because we haven 't done anything wrong . Or you just don 't want people to know what 's really going on . - Jack ... - don 't worry about it.I 'm over it . - Hang yourselves . - Jack . You shouldn 't be here , inspector . Yeah , I 've been getting that a lot lately . - Truth is , you shouldn 't be here . - Pardon me ? Whatever you find is not going to be admissible in court . Oh , really ? I didn 't take evidence off the premises legally . I didn 't have a warrant . There was a silent hit on the serial number . I 've articulated probable cause , and if we didn 't obtain any evidence illegally , it 's not going to be a problem . And you 've got to be one dumb cop if you didn 't know that . I 'm not dumb so much as desperate . I illegally lifted evidence from this house . At the very least , I 'm going to get disciplined by ia . I wouldn 't mind calling attention to your witch hunt . Look ... I know what this is about . I know your brother ran off with your girlfriend and you drink alone a lot , so I get that . As a guy , I feel for you . And if this is your way of showing her that you 're a stand-up guy , I guess we can do more dinner theatre if you want . I only got one brother . He 's messed up , but he 's not a crook . Go home , jack . Let 's do the garage . Hi , I 'm dan vasser with the register . Do you have a daughter named abby ? Hello ? No . Thank you . I-I mean , I used to . She changed her name to angela harvest . That 's maybe why I 've had trouble finding her . Listen , I don 't want to talk to any more reporters . I 'm sorry , I 'M ... I was a friend of abby 'S . I 'm not doing a story . I just want to find a way to reach her . Try sonoma correctional . - She 's in prison ? - Yeah . How long has she been there ? 30 years . What did she do ? Did she kill someone ? You know , for a friend of abby 's , you sure don 't keep in touch . hey , how 's it going ? Well , in a nutshell , I sent a girl to prison for life . Great . - Great ? - I 'm sorry.I didn 't hear your answer . My query was perfunctory . Are you okay ? I found livia . didn 't find anything , huh ? I can 't comment on an ongoing investigation . And I do not want to talk about your brother . Why 'd you call me here then ? You filed 24 incident reports that involve currency . Not one conflict of interest . Not even a spelling error . Well , I wasn 't expecting a citation for penmanship , but thank you . There was one blip , however . One of your reports was tampered with . - What ? - September 1995 . A cabbie was given a counterfeit $ 20 bill . The bill in question was not counterfeit , but a leaked prototype . Okay . Cabbie described his passenger as a stocky caucasian male with short , blonde hair . So what 's the problem ? The problem is the original bill is missing . I didn 't touch it.It 's sealed . Treasury secretary john snow is not appointed until 2003 . No counterfeiter could 've known that in 1995 . This seal means nothing . What does this have to do with my brother ? I don 't know . Did you catch and release him that day in ' 95 ? Where in that report does it say I was chasing dan vasser ? And what does this have to do with dylan mccleen 's ransom ? I 'm not sure , but i believe they are linked . I think for a federal agent you 've got way too much time on your hands . Thank you . Well , unfortunately , for you and your brother , that 's exactly right . I mean , I found outwhen she lives . - Where 'd you get this ? - In the livia box in the closet . The fbi turned the place upside down . I found it on the bed.So take your finger off the button . She told me this was her aunt . Is it her aunt ? Konwing what you know now . - She lives in the past . - But where ? I don 't know . I thought all you guys do is talk ? So now you 're upset that I don 't talk to her enough . I want to know where the other woman lives . - Katherine . - Dunston ... - good to see you . - How 's your end of the year list coming ? - Marvelous , a few surprises . - Oh , come on.Just give us a hint . You get rid of dan for a night and I 'll show you personally . katie , the man 's busy . - Hugh . - Katie . - How 's the new job ? - It 's good.Thanks. - What 's going on ? - Nothing . Yeah , he was just helping me with a story . Oh , perhaps , a more seasoned hand , huh ? Katie , I ... - right , um , you should probably go . - I 've got to run . - How 's the follow-up on candlestick point ? - I just sent it . Dan , I need to talk to you about the visitor yesterday . Can it wait ? I 've got to go to zack . No , no.This 'll take a second . Have you actually appeared on camera yet ? I haven 't committed any journalism yet . I 'm just filling out forms , but I start next week . Katie , you 're going to give all those women a run for their money . Even in high-def . - From your lips to the control room 's ears . - excully Well , good luck . Okay , dan ... get your ass down on the floor ! - Get on the floor now ! - Hey ! How 'd he get in here ? I thought you had the door ? I don 't know.He just appeared . Hey ! Get over here . - You watch these guys.You help me with the safe . - Right . hey , come here Kill the lights ! You , come with me. come on . where are you keep the money ? tell me.where are you keep the money ? - Don 't move . - Abby ? - Sam . - Don 't call him , abby . Sammy . Have you ever robbed anywhere before ? - You don 't use your real names . - Shut up ! - Don 't move ! - I know what you look like , abby . I 'm going to get up now , all right ? - hey . - Hi . Shut up . Dine-and-dash is one thing , abby , but knocking over liquor stores ... we 're redistributing food . - We 're going to feed the hungry . - Hey ! Who you talking to over there ? Tell them to shut up . You 're going to get yourself killed.Just shut up ! - what 's going on ? - It 's all sammy 's idea , isn 't it ? You and your mom , you do have lousy taste in men . Come here . Stick to the plan . - Remember the plan ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah , sorry , sorry . No wonder you never heard of the beatles . What ? Or program the vcr . You couldn 't program the vcr . - You live back then , don 't you ? - Yes . - When ? 19 ... - ' 48 . you travel to the future . And you travel to the past . The only time we meet is on business.We were never meant ... never meant to live together in your present . Or mine . - We were never meant to be , dan . - We 're out of sync.We always were . Give me the combination ! My boss has the combination.I don 'T ... give me the combination or I 'll blow your brains out ! - One . - I don 't have it , please . - Two . - Sam . Get on the floor ! Stay there ! Wait , that guy , hitchhiking to winterland . Take him outside and kill him . - What ? Me ? - Yeah . - Are you sure , man ? - Go ! We 're going outside.Move. This is not going to end well , guys . You or sammy are going to kill someone , you 're all going to get 30 years to life . Shut up ! Move . - We 're doing a good thing here . - This is not the way , abby . - Sammy 's a fraud and you 're just a ripe ... - That right ? We 're hearing this from two people who claim they can travel through time ? - What is your distribution plan for the food , sammy ? - Shut up . let him go.Let him go ! Dan . Let him go . you 're dead . Hey , hey , hey.Hey , hey ! It 's all yours.You can take it . Buy food and clothing for the poor , if that 's what you 're really doing.It 's a trick . S-sammy , this is as good . We can feed a lot of people with this.We can go now . I 'm telling you , sammy , there 's something about these two ; I get this vibe off them . - They could really ... - if the next words out of your mouth are " quartz crystals , " - I will kill you ! - Okay , okay . Take his watch . Mo , get the rest of the money . Abby , we 're the same . We 're on this strange road to god knows where , but you can 't just go along for the ride . Sometimes you got to know when to get off . Angela , do it . I wish I could get off , but I can 'T . You ... you can . Sammy . I don 't want to be told what to do anymore . Angela , stop . sammy ! clean out the register . now let 's get out here hurry , the cop come on - hurry up , - come on , get move , quickly , let 's go Get that money I don 't want to do this anymore , liv . I know . If some higher power wants me to do their dirty work , I want to know the reason why . Yeah , good luck with that . What about all those years we were together ? I came here in the late ' 80s and stayed . I didn 't have a mission , or at least I didn 't know what it was back then and ... I wasn 't being sent back , so I adapted . I had to survive . Like get a job . Say what you want about abby 's generation , but it pushed the needlea few degrees , so I did what would have been a lot harder in the 1940s . I went to law school . I sort of found myself . And then I met a guy . And I fell in love with him . And I was ready ... I was happy to spend the rest of my life with him . But something ... someone had other plans for us . Abby Armstrong Nabs 13th District on Progressiv Platform And when she disappeared off the plane ? She went back home . - To 1948 ? - Yeah . Could that happen to you ? Will you disappear for a long time back there ? - Livia says the trips will get longer . - Oh , god . Katie , I love you and I do not regret my choice .

Take a breath . In the end , all that matters is love . I love you , Peter . I love you too , Charles . You speak your mind . You know who you are . You know what you want . That 's your power . That 's your strength . Mind if I let you in on a little secret , Charles ? You can say anything to me , you know that . I can fly . Really ? Well , if you can fly , then show me . All right . Watch this . Simone . What 's wrong ? Come in . It 's my dad . That 's so weird . I was just having a dream about him . He passed away about an hour ago . I really needed to see you . You know , I get that you 're sort of socially slow , but you know you 're supposed to call someone before you come over . This you 're gonna want to hear right away . - I found the tape . - What tape ? The tape of you trying to kill yourself 20 times . I found it . Look , I was looking for my PSP under my bed , right ? And there it was . You 're safe . I thought this was supposed to be good news . Well , I can 't believe you had it this entire time ! - Why didn 't you look there before ? - I did . I tore the whole room apart . I must 've checked the bed , like , 50 times . Good morning , Mrs. Bennet . Good morning , dog . How are you , Zachary ? I 'm all right . Claire keeps punching me , though . Your dad 's plane 's gonna be late . I won 't be home until 8 : 00 or so . I am trusting you to hold down the fort . Because Lyle never listens to me . Well , he will listen to you today because he knows what a big day it is for Mr. Muggles . Thank you . And he doesn 't want to stress us out . - Whew , does he ? - Sure . Will you two help me out to the car ? Your dad left on the sprinklers last night . And I don 't want to get his paws all soggy . Here we go . Wish Mr. Muggles good luck . Micah ? Micah ? Micah ! Help me . Now , things have been really good between us these last couple days . Don 't you think ? I know . I like it . I just ... I feel like we 've been really honest with each other . - And that 's good , right ? - Yeah . There 's something that we need to talk about . Something that I discovered . I thought I 'd been so careful . Well , what ? What is it ? I don 't ... Oh , God , he knows . What ? What did you want to say ? It can wait , actually . I gotta ... I gotta get to work . Matt . Niki ? I was knocking , like , forever . What is it ? Micah . D.L. came back . He ... He took him . I tried to protect my son . But I couldn 't . I failed him . Landlord said Isaac 's gone . He took his paintings and ... Did you know he was leaving ? No . I can 't believe he would just go like that . I thought we were just starting to make sense of his paintings . I wanted to tell him what happened in person . Isaac sketched it for my dad 's 70th birthday . You know , I 've been trying to get him clean forever . The one time I need him . Feels like everybody 's leaving me . I 'm not going anywhere . He was still in a coma . And then , like it was any other day , he started talking . He said he 'd been flying all over the world . But that it was a world he didn 't recognize . There was so many people filled with pain . Nobody looking out for each other . He worried for them . And for me . Until you told him everything would be okay . - What do you mean I told him ? - I know . It doesn 't make any sense . But he said that you were flying with him . And you told him it was all gonna be okay . That there were people who cared . Who would make a difference . That you would save the world . After that , he just put his head down and ... He was gone . Like he was falling asleep . I never had that conversation with your father . But it sounds like something you would say . Those messages you left on my answering machine . You said you wanted one of Isaac 's paintings . Because it would help you save the world . It 's hard to explain . But if you had that painting ... I could save the world . Linderman . What ? The painting you want . I sold it to a guy named Linderman . He lives in Las Vegas . Linderman gave you $ 4 million , and you 're spending it on postcards . - I take it I 'm supposed to choose . - Mmm . - That one . - Well , that isn 't a red flag . You two agreeing on something . All right , gonna go to the office and have this printed up . Don 't you want to hear about how the New York Journal wants to do a cover story on you ? I 've invited Oliver Dennison to come for family brunch - and do an interview . - You 're kidding . No , I never kid about family brunch . That 's because we never have family brunch . Nathan , this could be great . I don 't know . Dennison could go anywhere for a bagel . He comes here , he 's gonna want something . Nothing wrong with taking advantage of an opportunity . Mandy ... Kids , why don 't you go finish that train set we started this morning , all right ? Take them upstairs . - I am not gonna use my family for political gain . - Tell that to Peter . Nathan , you 've been trying to protect me since this happened . It 's sweet in theory , but in practice , it 's insulting . - I 'm not made of glass . - I know . But we don 't need this . Four points behind says we do . I 've been hiding in this house for the last six months because your polling was afraid I 'd make you look weak . But now I can help by coming forward . Let me . You sure about this ? Set it up . Chef 's been cooking all morning . Oliver will be here in an hour . - Then I better get ready . - Yeah . Good idea . Feeling okay , Matt ? Hey , Tommy . Yeah , I 'm , uh ... I 'm good . Come on , buddy . We rode in the same car together for three years . I can practically read your mind . Dude , I don 't know where to start . How about we go get a beer ? - Dodger game at 7 : 00 . - Yeah . Yeah , I like that . Thanks . Hey , lady ! Would you look at that ! What 's going on ? What are you doing here ? Sylar , he 's killed again . I 'll brief you on the way to the morgue . Sylar ? Who 's Sylar ? - I gotta talk to my watch commander . - Taken care of . I 'll be outside . Put on some real person clothes . Lyle , you better not think I 'm cleaning up after you . We just got rid of all those ants . Such a dork . Okay , I 'm good . Oh , my ... Oh , my God ! - What are you doing ? - Oh , my God ! Claire ! Shut it off ! Lyle , give it to me ! Give it to me ! Claire ! It 's amazing what you can do with special effects these days , huh ? That was all special effects ? Yeah , what else would it be ? Ow ! What the hell is wrong with you ? Lyle , give it to me ! Lyle ! Lyle , get back here ! Lyle ! Don 't let him get away ! L yle ! Lyle ! Get back here ! Hey ! Why would you want to kill him again ? Because he found the tape and then he stapled me . Help ! Somebody help me ! My sister 's a freak ! Found him in a parking lot in Brentwood . Name 's Robert Fresco , an oncologist at UCLA medical center . Okay , so we figure out the M.O. Well , the M.O. is there is no M.O. Sylar 's victims are random . Eight deaths I have no clue how to explain . Trust me . This one 's number nine . Yeah , but there 's nothing out of the ordinary here , right ? Doesn 't this guy look like any other burn victim ? He 's putting out 1800 curies of radiation . Hazmat teams scoured the scene but didn 't find any incendiaries . No plutonium , no uranium ... Nothing . They did however find a fingerprint . Seared to the bone like a brand . Seared to the bone ? We 're running it through CODIS . Now , if we get a match and we can get close to him , I 'm gonna need you to get inside his head . Pick him out of a crowd , find him in a building ... Right , about that , um ... Lately it 's been harder for me to filter the voices . And hearing what they 're really thinking ... It can be ugly . What 's going on , Matt ? Theodore Sprague . AKA Sylar . We got you . So you 're just gonna sit there all day and not say a word , huh ? I want to go home . Like I told you , it 's not safe there with your mother . - Is she dead ? - No . - She 's gonna be fine . - How do you know ? - Dad , we left her on the floor . - We didn 't have a choice . Heroes don 't run away . - Micah ... - Bad guys do . Heroes help people , Dad . You know what ? - You 're a bad guy . - I 'm not a bad guy , all right ? Do you remember when I told you that six months ago I started having these bad dreams ? We all have bad dreams , Niki . I don 't think that they were just dreams . When they started , I thought that ... Maybe somebody was following me or something . And I would catch my reflection . But it wasn 't my reflection . It was another me . She has a name . - Jessica . - Jessica ? When someone tries to hurt me , it 's like she comes out . There is no Jessica . It 's just you . No , I see her in the mirror . And she tells me that she wants to come out again . The part of me that needs Micah back wants to let her do it . It 's just complicated with your mom and me . What 's up ahead ? Stay there . Dad , don 't ! Get out ! Quick ! What has happened ? He 'll never get her out in time . Lady , you gotta get up ! You gotta get out of there . You no worry . I help . - Dad ! - Hiro ! Why couldn 't I have super strength too ? Dad ! Micah ! Dad ... I thought you were dead . What happened ? I don 't know . We 're usually in our pajamas around the breakfast table . You can 't blame us for cleaning up for the Journal . Not when the hollandaise is made fresh . - You seem to be adjusting well . - To the wheelchair ? You can say it , Mr. Dennison . I lost my right to be sensitive when I married Nathan . I 'm not saying I didn 't have my darker moments during rehabilitation . I was angry for a long time . At your husband ? - Wasn 't he driving ? - At God . But we seem to have made our peace . Oh , hello , Peter . - What 's this ? - It 's brunch . - We always have brunch . - Since when ? Will you excuse me ? Peter , how good to see you . Nice of you to drop by , Peter . Whatever this is about , now is not the time . Charles Deveaux died this morning . I 'm sorry . - Were you there ? - No , I wasn 't . I stopped working for him so I could figure out what was going on with us . I told you to drop all this " I 'm special " crap . I can 't , all right ? I need your help . That man out there is Oliver Dennison . He 's working for the Journal doing a story on me . Everything I 've worked for is riding on our family being able to sit through a single meal together and smile . - So I 'm not family enough for you now . - No , you 're not . Not when you 're gonna ruin an election for me . I need you to get me a painting , all right ? Linderman bought it . Whoa , whoa ... We 're not exactly advertising that family connection around here . All right , great . So just get him on the phone and ask about the painting . Peter , I 'm sorry . But you 're gonna have to go , okay ? Hey , you know what ? I 'm just gonna fly off the terrace , yeah ? No ? Hey , I can fly . Nathan , so can you . I 'll tell you what . Why don 't we just race around the Statue of Liberty real quick , huh ? Give this tweedy guy something to write about . - You wouldn 't . - Ah ? Peter . Peter . Sorry , Nathan gave me an earful about showing up in cords . I told him I 'm trying to stay grounded . Good to have you back . How 'd you get this ? The issue isn 't even out yet . I got it in the future . It 's a story about me . Hiro . Um , see ... All the same . Hiro ... Even same car ! Nissan Versa ! I teleported . New York City . Yataa ! I freeze time too . Stop the explosion . Saved your dad ! - Hey , didn 't you visit my mom ? - Hmm ? We should get them to a hospital . Can you drive ? Don 't worry . Help is coming . I call the police . Time to go , Micah . Dad , you saved her . Like a real hero . Now we can go back and save Mom . I wish it were that easy . Well , it is , Dad . We just go back . No , Micah ... It 's not . I 'm sorry . We can 't go back . We can never go back . Come on . - Bye-bye ! - Take care ! Come on , you can 't stay in there forever ! Then just give me the damn tape . I 'm gonna put this thing on YouTube . Make , like , a million bucks . - YouTube 's free , you idiot . - You 're not helping . Lyle , no one can see what 's on that tape . Are you an alien or something ? Is he an alien too ? Yeah , yeah . We 're gonna ... We 're gonna anal probe you ! Zach ! Stop scaring him . I 'm not coming out until Mom and Dad get home . No , no , no . You cannot tell them . Lyle , please . - They cannot find out about this . - Why not ? Don 't you get it ? If they found out , Mom and Dad would think it was a mistake to ever adopt me . We wouldn 't be a family anymore . Please . - Thank you . - Whatever . Argh ! Wait a minute . Wait a second . We 're going in here without backup ? No one even knows we 're here , do they ? What is this all about with you ? You in my head , Parkman ? No , I 'm just ... I 'm asking a question . It 's about Sylar . I 'm not letting him get away this time . I 'm taking him down . Something 's burning . - Radiation ? - Curie levels are safe . What the hell is this ? What ... Hang on , I 'm getting some spikes . Hey . Check this out . Their faces are all burned off . What the hell happened in here ? 1800 curies of radiation . Come on , let 's get out of here . Of course I 'm gonna vote for Nathan . If Nathan takes care of the people half as much as he takes care of his brother , it 's gonna be an interesting city . - Pretty special family . - You have no idea . This is all very inspiring . I was surprised to learn the Linderman Group recently invested in your campaign . I don 't know why you 'd be surprised . Mr. Linderman was a good friend of my father 's . So you don 't deny going to Las Vegas to meet with a reputed mobster . Is that why you 're here ? I spoke with a former member of your security detail . It seems there was a bit of a scare . You disappeared from the casino for several hours . And there was a blonde involved . It 's all right , Nathan . You can tell him . - Right , um ... - Look , um ... I 'm sure that you 've recently heard about my mental health issues . I quit my job because of it . My brother basically saved my life . And he 's convinced me to get the help that I needed . There 's a private clinic outside Vegas . Nathan went , spoke to a doctor ... A woman doctor . I made him promise that no one would know . Not even the family . But I just don 't care who knows anymore . Okay ? I didn 't want to say anything until I cleared it with you . That 's Nathan . You know , right in the middle of an election , he still has time to help out his messed-up little brother . Oh , well ... What 's this ? - They counteract radiation poisoning . - Oh , thanks . One second . Who keeps calling you ? Uh , nobody . It 's my wife . Since when is your wife nobody ? Listen , I don 't think this guy 's Sylar . Yeah ? Well , we 'll see . Look what I found in the bedroom . Look at this . Methotrexate . This is chemotherapy in a pill . This is prescribed to Karen Sprague and it 's current . - She has cancer ? - Check out the doctor on the label . - Dr. Robert Fresco ... - Right . - The oncologist . - Mmh . Karen Sprague 's room ? Take it easy , Ted . We just want to ask you some questions . I didn 't mean to kill him . Dr. Fresco said there was nothing he could do to save her . I tried to convince him , you know ? There must be something else that he could do . Anything . And we argued . And I lost control . We can talk about this downtown . - Hey , let her go . - If you let me stay with my wife . No , you let her go or I shoot . Do you have any idea what would happen if you did that ? Because I don 't . Maybe I 'll explode . Maybe I 'll take out this whole hospital . Maybll wipe out this city like an atomic bomb . - Just leave me alone ! - We can 't do that ! Stop , Teddy , stop ! Karen wants you to stop . - How could you say that ? - She says you need to listen . Ted , you never listen . You 're too damn stubborn . But you 're still her teddy bear . Gimme a break . You think you can hear her ? He 's telling the truth , Ted . Listen to him . What 's she saying ? She 's saying she ... She doesn 't blame you ... For all the pain and the worry . She 's saying it 's not your fault , Ted . She shouldn 't be here . It 's not fair . She 's saying it never is . She said that was the best date . The picnic on the beach . And it poured sheets and sheets of rain . We sat in my car ... And listened to the whole American Beauty album . She remembers it all . She always will . What 's she saying now ? Hi , this is Niki Sanders from Las Vegas . I need your help . I know that I 'm probably the last person that you want to talk to . You should not have called me here . I know that I have no right to . But I need your help . My husband took my son . I have nowhere else to go . I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . You have the wrong number . - Hi , Hon. - Hi . - Where are the boys ? - In the play room . - Do you still love me , Nathan ? - Of course I do . I know what this chair means to us as a couple . But I need you to know that I 'm going to walk again . The doctors say it 's a long shot . But I can do it if I have a reason . We just need some hope , Nathan , that our life can be like it was . What Peter said about you checking out a clinic for him with a doctor . Tell me that 's what happened . If you say it is ... I 'll believe you . Just give me some hope . It 's true . Come on . - I 'm gonna get the kids ready for bed . - Okay . What the hell happened ? You should just ... You should just go . Niki , what is going on here ? Are you okay ? I said that you can go now . It 's me . I 'm just trying to help you out , girl , okay ? She doesn 't need your help anymore . Understand ? - Hey . - Hey . So they 're gonna run Sprague through decontamination . And then put him in a special holding tank downtown . How 'd he cause all that damage with his bare hands ? How do you hear what people are thinking ? You did a great job in there . Well , the guy was losing his wife . He just wanted to talk to her , say goodbye . You talk to your own wife yet ? You 've been dodging her call all day . Well , I 'm gonna head downtown , - cover Sprague 's processing . - Right . Hey , it 's me . I actually thought you might be home by now . I 'm calling just to ... talk , um ... Look , I had this stupid idea in my head that ... that I 'm losing you . And I ... I just ... I can 't help but have the feeling that there 's something you 're not telling me . And I don 't want us to live with any regret . Or blame . I don 't know . I guess I 'm just afraid of things going unsaid . I love you . And ... And I just wanted to tell you that . You don 't have to call me back . I 'll see you later tonight . Yes , Mr. Linderman . It seems my brother 's developed some sort of emotional attachment to this painting . I don 't know what 'll happen to him if he doesn 't get it . But I 'd rather not find out . Directly to the gallery . Mr. Linderman , I appreciate it . Good night . You need to tell Heidi the truth . No . She doesn 't need the truth . She needs hope . - What , is that some kind of excuse ? - I 'm not saying what I did was right . That girl in Vegas ... I just needed to be with someone who ... didn 't make me feel guilty every time I looked at her . Did you ... Did you talk to Linderman ? - Yeah . Sit down . - And ? He 's not gonna let it go . Hey , come on . Just let it go . - It 's just a painting . - It 's more than that , Nathan . This is about what 's going on with us . All right , this ... This painting is the key . With this thing , we can make a difference . I 'm trying to make a difference , Peter , the best way I know how . Flying around , how is that going to help anybody ? What is that gonna ... What am I gonna do when I get there ? I don 't have a gun . I don 't have a badge . I don 't know karate . I guess I could put on a costume and fly around and pull cats out of trees . How 's that gonna make a difference ? You 're not gonna know until you try . I 'm sorry about the painting . Listen , something else happened in Vegas that I ... What ? These two guys , they tried to pull me out of my hotel room . They did . It was like a , um ... A kidnapping attempt or something . - How 'd you get away ? - I flew . - So who were they ? - The one who did all the talking had these horn-rimmed glasses . The other guy was a spooky euro dude . He didn 't say a word . Son of a bitch . You really expect me to believe that ? Yeah . - I 'm not lying to you . - No ? No . Think about it . What would people do if they knew what we were capable of ? They 'd lock us up and they 'd throw away the key . Now who sounds crazy ? Be careful . Yeah . Someone had a good day . It 's all over the station . FBI bust , Homeland Security collar ... - Congrats , buddy . - Thanks , man . It really wasn 't anything , though . It must 've been something . Your FBI girlfriend just put in a request for you to retake the detective 's exam as a series of interviews . - Can 't blame it on the dyslexia this time . - Wait a second ... Interviews ? I didn 't even know that was an option . She 's FBI . She pulled some strings . And you are gonna pass it , no problem . Thanks , man . Wow . Loser . I 'm nailing your wife , and she is so fine ... So fine ... - Hey , you still want to grab that drink ? - Son of a bitch ! You do not choose your destiny . It chooses you . And those who knew you before fate took you by the hand cannot understand the depth of the changes inside . - Yeah ? - Mom . Micah . Hey , baby , I 've been worried . - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - Are you ? - I 'm good . Are you with your dad right now ? Uh , yeah . I just got out for one minute . Mom ... - Mom , is this really you ? - Tell me where you are , baby . Just put my mom on the phone . Your mom 's not here right now . And she 's not coming back until I take care of a few things . So , why don 't you tell me where you are . I 'll come get you and bring you home . Your mom needs you . I 'm in a little motel . It 's right off the Interstate 14 . It 's called the Littlefield Motel . You talking to your mom ? No . No , I 'm just goofing around . Come on . We got some driving to do . - They cannot fathom how much you stand to lose in failure . - Micah ? But you are the instrument of a flawless design . And all of life may hang in the balance . A hero learns quickly who can comprehend and who merely stands in your way . Thanks to Raceman for the Transcript Subtitles Made By The Bloc Team

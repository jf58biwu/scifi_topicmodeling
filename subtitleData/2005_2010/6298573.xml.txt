 LUCY : I 'm sorry , I have to go . I 'm not safe for you to be around . But know this . Nobody resigns from Summakor . Nobody . They 're selling tickets for your execution , Michael , but they 're calling it a promotion . ( Soundtrack over speech ) There is a place . Another place . It 's where they sent them . It 's where they sent me . It 's where they sent you . Whatever you do , stay away from Summakor . You killed her ! Come on out here and fight like a man ! Every bit of pain I know is because of you ! I will find a way to make you suffer ! To make you feel ! Do you hear me ? ( Rock music ) ( Music stops ) ( Hushed silence ) Do you come here to hurt me ? You raised me up on lies . Did you do that to hurt me ? 2 : You 're my son ! ( Breathless ) Lies ? Do you think I don 't doubt ? My conscience whispers to me night and day . And sometimes I listen . But most ofthe time , I keep my faith in the Village . Where is the Village ? Inside . The mind is capable of anything because everything is in it . All the past as well as all the future . She volunteered . Your mother 's mind is capable of anything . The science of it all beguiled her . But the reason for it ? The real reason was you . She did it for her son . This one opens the cabinet , as you know , 1 1-12 . That is where the pills are kept . The pills that keep her sleeping ... .. keep her dreaming . I give it to you . Why now ? I thought , if I can give him this ... .. a day with her . Think of it . You will meet your mother . She won 't know me ... .. who I am . How will I know what to say to her ? A day with your mother . You want to know the truth . When you decide . ( Whispered voices ) WOMAN : Don 't look at me ! WOMAN : Put it on your head . ( Gasps ) What are you ... what are you doing ? You scared me . You kissed me . Yeah , uh , I ... Uh ... I-I don 't know why I um .. You do know . No , I mean , I don 't know why I did it ... there . I just couldn 't help myself . - You couldn 't help yourself . - That 's right . I know that feeling . No ! No , I 'm sorry . Not like this . ( Sighs ) ( Door opens ) 313 , I need to talk with you . 4-15 . She 's gone . Is itjust nothingness down in those holes ? What 's happened to her ? She 's gone . I um ... That 's all we know about her , so er ... My head is so full of nightmares . What , and last night , what was your head full ofthen ? - Last night ? - How very flattering . What ? - I 'm sort of rushed off my feet , so please ... - What 's wrong with you ? You were in my apartment last night ! You might at least acknowledge that fact ! - Is this some kind of dream ? - Just go ! - Oh , no , man . You must be jokin ' . - What do you mean ? - Last thing I need is another fight with you . - Another fight ? ( Beeping ) Damn . I 've been sitting on my card again . I 'll have to go downstairs and get it renewed . You have a problem with that ? What 's it for ? - You 're asking me what is it for ? - Yes . Are you gonna give me a hard time again ? Again ? Look ... .. if you just tell me what this receipt is for , I 'll go . I 'll leave you alone . Anyone can fake a receipt . Why would I fake a receipt ? I don 't even know what it 's for . Are you recording this ? I don 't supply knives . You show me a man who says I gave him any kind ofweapon , I will show you a liar . Thank you . WOMAN : Operator . - Hello . Clinic , please . - You said you spoke with me . - Spoke ? - I thought you were gonna bite my face off . - But I wasn 't there , it wasn 't me . Don 't get weird on me , 6 . If you got mental difficulties , get mental help - because we all got our problems . - Something is happening here . 313 said I was with her , but I wasn 't there . It wasn 't me ! Hey , listen . You have got to get your act together . ( Car horn ) Argh ! ( Groans ) - Who are you ? - You know who I am . You saw what 2 did to 4-15 and you 're just gonna take that ? What 's the plan , huh ? Just stand there and shout at his door ? Do you think words are gonna change anything , hm ? I am who you were intended to be . I am vengeance . There is only one way . Kill 2 . ( Groans ) ♪ MOZART : Cosi Fan Tutte ( Opera continues playing ) - Come on . - ( Groans ) Who is he ? Who is who ? There 's a man in the Village ... who looks like me , exactly like me . He says he 's going to kill you . - 6 is going to kill me ? - No , he 's going to kill you . Oh ! And that 6 , he 's angry ? Well , isn 't that how you feel ? Come on , admit it . You 'd love it , love it , the chance to kill me . After what you 've done , yes , I 'd like you dead . So , you will be the assassin . Isn 't that logical ? Don 't we live by logic ? Not your logic . Not any more . And your game , what you do to me here ... ( Chuckles ) .. won 't stop me . Are you quite sure that it is a game ? Yes . Cos no-one gets close to 2 unless 2 wants them to . Well , perhaps he will . You will . Perhaps the moment will come . I 'll walk today . Be seeing you . ♪ You were my sunshine ♪ My only sunshine ♪ You made me happy when skies were grey ♪ You 'll never know , dear , how much I loved you ♪ How could you take my sunshine away ? Impersonating 2 is an act oftreason . In the event of a 2 impersonator arising , you must seek him out and apprehend him . This man may look like 2 , but you will know that he is not 2 , because he is not 2 . He may appear in the Village in a dishevelled state , which has elements of resemblance to 2 . He may claim to be 2 , but he is not , and he must be treated as who he is , which is someone who is not 2 . He is a danger to the Village . ( Muffled sirens ) ( Muffled car horn ) Mum ? ( Gasps gently ) 1 1-12 ? ( Shop bell jangles ) ( Clears throat ) - Do you have cigarettes ? - No . But would you like a map ofthe Village ? Are you sure you don 't have cigarettes ? Would you look ? We haven 't had cigarettes here for eight years and five months . If you don 't look , how can you be really sure that you 're right ? Guilty pleasures . ( Chuckles ) - I didn 't supply you with these cigarettes . - No . I don 't have them . I don 't even know what they are . I 've forgotten they even existed . You came in here to buy a map . I used to smoke in order to think . You did ? - And are you thinking now ? - I am . - Sometimes , I ... - Yes ? - I think ... - Yes , go on . If I could choose ... .. there 's ... a place I want to spend the rest of my life . A warm place ... with no memory . Just be careful what you say around here . People will report you as soon as look at you . Don 't be different . I wonder ifwe smoke to feed the guilt . Speaking only for myself , I smoke for that fine oaky flavour with just a hint of lavender . These things kill you , you know ? The main health risks in tobacco relate to diseases of the cardiovascular system . In particular , myocardial infarction , diseases ofthe respiratory tract , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ... .. and asthma , emphysema , and cancer , in particular , lung cancer and cancers ofthe larynx and tongue . So I 've heard . Smoking is a kind of ... suicide . That 's a bit philosophical ... for a Thursday . Thank you . And I say good day to you . ( Shop bell jingles ) WOMAN : Operator . - Hello . Clinic , please . Am I like you imagined ? I mean , you know , do ... do I act like ... - I know what you mean . - Sorry . It 's just I haven 't had , uh , too much practice at this and um ... ( Clears throat ) Will your father be joining us ? All the family together , I ... .. I 'd like that . No , he 's um ... he 's gone away for a while . He suggested that perhaps I get to know you . Get to understand . The things I 've seen ... .. in these walls . You mean ... ? Everything . Every step ... you ever took . I mean , nobody warned me . Nobody ever said that ... .. that dreaming would be such hard work . Say what 's in those sad eyes of yours . I 'm sure you 'll see that the Village has ... .. everything that you 'll need . It doesn 't have you . ( Sighs wearily ) - 2 . - Huh ? Oh ! It would be quite a coincidence if I was 2 , but I am Un-Two , so , there is no coincidence . You know , if he gets to you , I won 't be able to stop him . I am no more than a numberless wanderer . I know nothing about killers and their motives , lost to their own appetites . Such beasts have no moral compass . Then why did you create ' em ? Ifthat 's what you don 't want me to become , then why ? It might be fun , though , might it not , to indulge him ? Take him a woman . Say 313 ... ifthat 's what you desire . If I can 't control my desires , you can control me ? Animals like that are easily manipulated . They leave themselves open to be prodded in whatever direction their masters may ask . Yes . Oh , I pity a man like that . Or I would , if I knew anything about such things . Hm ? ( Chuckles ) - Hey . - Hm ? Hey ! Hey , man , don 't you know you can 't be sittin ' there just dreamin ' in the sun ? Gonna get into all kinds oftrouble out here . Come on , we gotta get you up . Where do you live ? What 's your number ? Oh , I 'm a man with no number . Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no . Don 't say that out loud . You 'll have every undercover round here down on your case . Come on , get you offthe street . - ( Bicycle bell jingles ) - You know what he 's doing , don 't you ? What are you accusing me of now ? Look , he 's taken some part of me , separated it out somehow . It 's out there . Please listen ! Look , no . Look . I 'm sorry to pop your balloon , 6 , but you were there in my bedroom , and as far-fetched as it may sound , I actually gave you the elbow . - You kicked him out ? - Grow up ! - You have a problem with that ? - Yeah . My card got bent , and I need a replacement , please . You have the paperwork to back that up ? Why would I lie ? Why would you come into work at dawn ? Why are you here ? I 'm always here . Do I know you ? I 'm the access guy . Everybody knows the access guy . If you tell me what this receipt is for ... I 'll go . I 'll leave you alone . Anyone can fake a receipt . You feel something , I know it . Now , I need to get up to the purpose floor . I need you to make me a card . Mmm ! Damn fine cake . ( Chuckles ) You know who you kinda remind me of ? He looks like 2 . - Oh , you think so ? - Mm-hm . You could be a 2 double . That 'd be a greatjob ! - ( Laughs ) - Say , do you do a 2 impersonation ? No , go ahead , say something in the 2 vein . No , I-I am 2 . ( They laugh ) No , really , I-I am 2 ! Hmm , yeah . You do look a bit like him , but 2 's got those death-cold eyes . ( They laugh ) ( Silence ) ( Approaching siren ) ( Clears throat ) Hey , they 're coming here . I told you , you can 't be a man without a number here . It 's all right , I am 2 . Tell them that , they will blow your head off . Come on . ( Cocks gun ) ( Hums contentedly ) ( Clink ) Knock , knock . How goes love 's young dream ? Always shining brightly , trembling with ardour . Oh , dear . - 2 ? - Not today . Today , we are none of us who we appear to be . I keep having this dream . Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there . What if I were to tell you that there is another place ? What ? Would you care to see it ? - I ... - Would you dare to visit such a place ? I ... I ... I don 't know . Very well . Un-Two will grant your wish . Whether you wish it or not . - Wh-why are you doing this ? - An imp ofthe perverse . I don 't want to go anywhere ! ( He sings ) ♪ The animals went in two by two , hoorah , hoorah I don 't want to go anywhere . I don 't want to go anywhere . ( Sings falteringly ) ♪ Animals go in ... two by two ♪ Hoorah - I thought I 'd lost you . - No . I just wanted to walk . You know , take it all in . I want to go to the other place . Oh , I don 't think so . Village is best for us . It is possible to go , though ? Yeah , but why would you want to ... when we have the Village ? What did you see when you walked ? I saw what happens when I 'm awake . I saw the holes . But ifthat 's what it 's like , why don 't we leave ? Because ... Only some people can go there , you know , to ... to the other place . Who can go there ? - Who ? - People that exist there ! People ... people that were brought here , that weren 't ... born here . People who weren 't born here ? - Like me . - Yeah , but it 's enough , isn 't it ? No . Please , don 't ... don 't go ! Don 't , don 't ... Please , just let us talk ! I mean ... It 's our day . ♪ The animals came in two by two ... ( Echoes ) ♪ Two by two , hoorah Are you hiding ? - Not from me , I hope . - You wish . Uh ... Which one are you ? The one you can trust . Have you ever felt so alone , that ... you find yourself lost one day ? - Have you ? - Ssh . ( Door slams ) I 'm sorry . ♪ The animals came in two bytwo , hoorah , hoorah ♪ .. hoorah ( Muffled humming ) Two-Times-Six will try to get close to your father . He will pose as 6 . So , I must get to your father first , before Two-Times-Six does . Where will 2 be ? My father has gone out into the Village . But you know where he 'll be ... where he might go . Yes . The Village church . You know who I am , don 't you ? You are Two-Times-Six . And yet , you tell me where to find him . He wanted me to decide . I am decided . Are you 6 ? If I was Two-Times-Six , you 'd know it by now . Yes . What have I done ? Yes , sit with me , hm ? The world is not a pretty thing when you look at it too close . We fell in love with atrocity . We make pornography and call it news . A daily fix of horror . They think the coming disaster is going to be ecological , that the problem is political , but no , no , the great war is psychological . It 's in here . ( Imitates gunshot ) We have made ourselves into fat and faded wheezing animals . Educated in apathy , amused by cruelty . So , this . We make a new world . Something human . And yet , there is a whispering in my ear that tells me I was wrong , they were right , and the savages , savages , savages had it right all along . ( Sighs ) I wanted you to come . I wanted you to ... to wipe out my guilt . You were right . You are the way . Become hatred ! Become vengeance ! Yes , I respect that . Kill me . I see the logic in that . And I 'm not afraid , at all , because we know , you and I , how it is to be human . We must submit to the beast in man . I tell you this because ... I know who you are . You are not 6 . Can you still kill me , if you understand the purpose ? Yes . - Don 't give him what he wants . - Oh , dear 6 , you 're too late . If you do this , we are lost ! He will take the thing that keeps him from owning us : our conscience . Words change nothing ! You hear me ? Words change nothing ! I know that . I accept that . I have to accept you . ( Sighs ) Don 't make us become the thing we fear . Ifwe are one , then we can defeat 2 . - One ? - Come back . It was only when your father and I ... embarked on this adventure that ... that I decided ... Oh , I wanted ... .. that I realised what a beautiful thing it would be to have a child . We were gonna be a real family , together like this every day . 1 1-12 : Is there no other way ? Every time I wake up , these holes ... Just empty . Oh , look at us ... the two of us . I .. Stay with ... Oh ! Argh ! ( Groans ) Don 't you know the real 2 when he is back amongst us ? Well , I like their enthusiasm . I thought they might knee me in the face and stamp on my brain . Still , perhaps another time . Let me tell you where you can properly direct your exuberance ! Would you like me to tell you who our 2 impersonator really is ? Oh , please ... please , help me . They 've been saying I 've been impersonating 2 ! Purpose floor access granted . ( Overlapping voices ) These people , they 're my subjects . Hey , that 's me ! - A lot of people trying to get in , you know ? - Is that me ? They 'd kill for myjob . When did this happen ? How did it happen ? I started this . I found these people , and I put them into my reports . I did this . I 'm sorry . I have to go . 2 : What if I were to tell you that there is another place ? ( Alarm bleeps ) Someone 's trying to get inside . There is a place . Another place . 2 : Would you care to see it ? Another place . It 's where they sent them . It 's where they sent me . And you . Whatever you do , stay away from Summakor . ( Soundtrack over speech ) Hey !

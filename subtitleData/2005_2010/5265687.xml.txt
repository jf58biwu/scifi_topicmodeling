 Destiny ... The Design is clearly ancient , launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Where the hell are we ? Several billion light years from home . We are on a ship , but we have no idea where we are in relation to Earth . This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the Stargate itself . These are the wrong people , in the wrong place . We 've got a lot of wounded . We need to get home . We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial Earth . Yeah , I read about these Chinese miners that survived a cave-in for six days by drinking their urine . I 'm going to go ahead and pretend I didn 't hear that . Yeah . You know what they ate ? Coal . Coal ? Yeah . It 's a true story . I mean , don 't get me wrong , it was pretty stupid . Almost killed them . Water level 's down again . You 're sure nobody went near that compartment on your watch ? Spencer came by and asked if he could have a look in the tank . Why ? He 's a crazy person . Sir . Anyway , I said no . Nobody goes in there without my authorization . Sir . Maybe it evaporated when we went through the star . It 's a closed system . All that water went somewhere . We 're down to half of what we had when we got here . I don 't understand this . You 're the one trying to get the recycling system up and running . Maybe there 's a leak somewhere . Ship says it 's fine . If what you 're saying is accurate ... It is . Then we 've got a serious problem . Well , we wouldn 't If you did what I asked you to do in the first place ... Oh , please , can we stick to one problem at a time ? Running out of water wouldn 't matter if we just dial earth and go home . I already explained that to you . The ship 's recharged . The power reserves are full . That 's the point , they 're not ! Well , where are we at , then , Rush ? Probably about less than 40 of original Design capacity . You think I can 't tell when someone just pulls a number out of his ass ? What ? Uh , I actually pulled that number out of my ass . He 's not making it up . Look , if Destiny was ever capable of dialing back to Earth , It was thousands of years ago , when the Ancients originally intended to come here . But not now . Well , then , you 're right . We have a problem . Yes ... Again . Okay , Eli ... Get Brody in on this . He 's an engineer . I need to borrow Eli . 40,000 liters ? That 's what I heard . Well , we didn 't drink it . Let 's just say it wouldn 't surprise me if there was more water than they 're telling us . So , what , they 're hoarding it ? It 's a big ship . You know the military . Long as they control the water supply , they control us . That 's right , I 'm talking about you . Those two are harmless . Keep it up . I need to know who I can trust . I feel like a spy . Eli ... Clean this room up . Right . What is it ? Nothing , sir . Just had a strange feeling . Well , we just dropped out of FTL . Wasn 't that . I 'm on my way to the gate room . There 's a planet in range . Come on . What have we got ? There 's only one planet in range . The ship 's already dialed it up . We 're getting readings now . Whoa ... Looks like we entered the hoth system . Empire strikes back . The second Star Wars movie . Okay , I refuse to call it episode V. Minus 47 degrees celsius . Bundle up . Is that water ice ? Yes , but the atmosphere is dangerously thin . And poisonous . .13molecular oxygen , 95 Â± arbon dioxide , with a hint of Argon . Ooh , nasty planet . The only candidate within range . We 're going to have to use the spacesuits we found , but if that brings back a half a ton of ice , I 'll take it . Shut it down for now . Lieutenant Scott , come in , please . Scott ? There a reason your radio 's off ? Come in . Colonel Young is looking for you . Uh , I think I 'd better ... Go , go . What , you couldn 't find a broom closet ? We 're still working on the other suits . We 're close to having a third one ready . How close ? A day , maybe ? We 'll be back in FTL by then . Well , they 're not in great shape . All these years , there 's bound to be degradation . Well , keep at it , we 're going to need them . Looks like it 's just you and me , then . I could take Kennair , sir . She 's done Eva 's before , and you 're ... I 'm fine . How are we going to cut the ice ? Plasma cutter . Should cut through the ice like butter . Just don 't get the business end anywhere near you . Uh , suit radios are voice-activated between you . Press here if you want to tie into the ship 's communication systems . T.J ... You 're in command while we 're gone . Is everybody clear on that ? Oh , I 'm sure we 'll manage . Riley ... Start dialing . Assuming a fair amount of physical activity , you have just over eight hours of air . It 's what , 11 hours until the next jump to FTL , Right ? Don 't worry . You 'll run out of air long before we leave you behind . Thanks . Beautiful , huh ? One deep breath , and you 're dead . Destiny , this is Young . Come in . Yes , sir , we hear you five by five . I 've just tested the ice by the Stargate . I read concentrations of ammonia and several other toxic chemicals . How high are the readings ? Off the charts . Well , you could try looking farther afield . Maybe on the other side of that lake . Is that really a good idea , sir ? The further away from the gate we go , the less ice we can bring back . Oh , I 've got just the thing . Give me two minutes . Colonel , give us five . Eli has an idea . Uh , maybe there 's fresh water in the lake under the ice . At minus 47 , the ice will be 10 feet deep . We 're better off finding a pressure ridge , something we can mine . Sounds like you 've done something like this before . Oh , yeah . A million times . Whoa , did you feel that ? It 's just a tremor . Hey , you know , the last planet I was on exploded . Destiny , this is Young . We 're burning through suit air . What 's going on with this bright idea ? Here we come , people ! Here we come ! Sorry , it 's impossible to steer by remote . That 's fantastic , Eli . What made you come up with that ? A ... actually , it represents my most recent attempt to fly , but it should carry a ton of ice . Colonel , we 're sending through Eli 's latest invention . I love it ! The man gets a gold star . How much will it hold ? Definitely more than you can carry by yourself . All right , we 're heading out . Keep the gate active . We 'll radio back when we find something . T.J ... Sir ? Listen , if we don 't make it back ... You will . Well , we 're two guys in million-year-old space suits walking around alone on an ice planet . If we don 't make it back ... You 're going to do fine . Yes , sir . Good luck . The level 's dropped . Again ? Nobody 's been in or out . Well , Brody said there 's no leak in the system , so that leaves one alternative . Who could steal that much ? That 's a lot of water . Yeah , I know , but I don 't know what else to do . Besides , it wouldn 't hurt to know where we stand . Start a search . Let 's go , Gorman . Dial it up again , Mr. Riley . We must maintain communication . It just went off a second ago . Your timing is perfect ! Because it 's been 38 minutes , the maximum time a Stargate can remain open . Well , see , I didn 't know that . Colonel Young , it 's Dr. Rush . What 's your status ? We 've found an exposed area of ice that looks promising . Testing now . We 're pretty far out . Can 't see the gate anymore . It 's still worthless . Keep looking . Lieutenant Johansen . Go ahead . I found something . So did I. Can it wait ? It 's Spencer . I can deal with him myself if you 'd like , but ... No , it 's fine . I 'll be on my way . I didn 't steal anything ! Yeah ? What 's this , huh ? Those are mine ! I brought them through with me when we evacuated ! You brought them through with you , huh ? Give me a reason . Hey , hey , hey ! Back off ! I don 't have time for this ! Lock him up somewhere . The Colonel can deal with him when he gets back . You said you found something . To be honest , I don 't know what I saw . I have to talk to Rush . You keep searching . Nothing we find is going to add up to what 's missing . I know , but we have to know what we 've got . No one 's gone near the tank , and it keeps going down . Come on , come on ... Destiny ... This is Young . We got pure ice . That 's excellent news . It 's a frozen waterfall . We should be able to break it up into manageable pieces and haul it back . We 'll be ready for you . Busy day on Destiny . I haven 't taken anything . I don 't think you have . What are you doing ? Checking for stolen rations . It 's okay , Dr. Franklin . Confess , miss Armstrong . You drank 40,000 liters of water . He 's kidding . I know . I 'm just saying , we have rights . I 'm done here , miss Armstrong . I hope I haven 't inconvenienced you . I understand . I knew that you would . You . Next . This is never going to be enough . Stand back . You 've done this before , too , have you ? At least five times . You mind if I give it a shot ? Remember , all we have are the bullets we brought with us . So , are we talking about , like , one little cloud of bugs , or are they all over the ship ? I 'm not even sure that " bugs " is the right word for them . Huh , what about " cloud ? " Except the cloud was alive . It was almost like thousands of tiny ... alien creatures . Yeah , I have a problem with everything you just said . What you 've just described is ... well , it 's the same as Lieutenant Scott claimed he saw on the desert planet . That 's what I was thinking , and maybe some of them followed him back here . Wouldn 't we have noticed them ? No , not if Only a few came through the gate . They 're like tiny grains of sand . And then what , started reproducing ? Well , if it 's a living organism , then yeah , they would . Okay , so now we 've got aliens . What if they start bursting out of our stomachs ? I don 't think they 're dangerous . It almost felt like they were trying to communicate . Lieutenant Scott used the same word . Yeah , at the time , you said he was delirious . Well , I was wrong . What do you intend to do ? Well , I guess we should stop everyone from wandering around the ship . After you . Um ... here ? Yeah , yeah . This is Lieutenant Johansen . We have a situation . It 's under control , but as a precaution , I ask everyone to return to their quarters and remain there until further notice . Thank you . You 're , uh ... you 're not going to tell them ? That we 've got aliens ? No , we 'll keep it on a need-to-know basis . What else ? You 're in charge . And I 'm asking your advice . What else ? Always consider the greater good . That 's it . That 's enough ice for now . Let 's get out of here . Gorman , meet me in the gate room . We have ice on the way . Copy . They 're on it . Dial it back , please . Destiny , this is Young . How 's it going up there ? Offloading the sled now . Well , hurry it up . We want to do one more run . Just so you know , uh , another matter has come up . We have it under control . We have aliens on the ship . What ? They just shredded Gorman . What the hell does that mean ? Millions of tiny flying razor blades floating around the ship like piranha . Corporal Gorman is alive . Uh , Lieutenant Johansen is tending to him now . He 's probably not going to make it . Eli ! That 's it . We 're coming back . No , no , no , that 's not necessary , Colonel . Eli is overreacting . We believe the creatures are the same as those Lieutenant Scott encountered on the desert planet . They must have followed us back through the gate . No , I doubt those things I saw were dangerous , sir . They ... they helped me . Corporal Gorman may have provoked them . We 'll know more once he comes to . If he comes to . In the meantime , Lieutenant Johansen has ordered everyone to remain in their quarters . They 're nothing more than a nuisance at this point , Colonel , but we desperately need more ice . All right . We 'll figure out what to do with them when we get back . Okay , sending the sled back through now . Rush out . You 're going to have to learn when to shut up . You can 't just ... You can 't just lie to the guy and expect me to ... Once back into FTL , it could be days before we find another planet capable of replenishing our water supplies . This ice represents a fraction of what we need to stay alive . We need more ! Yeah , I know ! But that doesn 't mean that you can ... Yes , it does ! You 're making it sound like we 're ... Just stop acting like a child , please ! We have to figure this out . I said " we . " I say we torch ' em . You know , put some teams together , hunt them down . Where 'd you get that ? I can invent things too . Hey , we 've really got to work together on this project ... You know , maybe the bugs were just responding out of self-defense . Self-defense ? Did you see what they did to Gorman 's face ? Yeah , I 'm the one treating him , Sergeant . I saw exactly what they did to his face . Look , we don 't know what it is we 're dealing with , and " torching " them may only serve to antagonize them further . We hit them with something else . Oh , revenge , that 's great . We ... we got to do something . If we just sit around till they drink all of our water , then we 're going to ... Alien bugs show up and half our water disappears . Don 't tell me I 'm the only one who made this connection . Well , obviously not . The question is , what are we going to do about it ? Okay , Sergeant , you and your go team go search for this alien ... entity , cloud , bugs , whatever it is we 're calling them , and report back , okay ? Yes , ma 'am . And Sergeant ? No torching . Yes , ma 'am ! Ooh , I have an idea ! It 's going to be dark soon . Okay , stand back . Nothing 's happening . Oh ... Yes , there is . It 's like vapor . We just can 't see them . That 's what they did when I first saw them . It 's like they just disappear . So they 're growing in numbers exponentially , and consuming our resources without us even knowing it . You have to get them off the ship . Sergeant Greer , come in . I 'm a little busy right now . The bugs are getting into the water tank every time we open the hatch . Once we locate the main swarm , we 're going to have to find ... They 're in front of me right now . Don 't antagonize them . I won 't , unless they antagonize me first . Do they move when you do ? They do now . What we need is an airlock . Unfortunately , there are none in the habitable compartments of the ship . I know what to do . This isn 't going to keep us going very long . Maybe Destiny will figure out we 're getting short on water and find us a planet with nice fresh water right next to the Stargate . I mean , come on , we deserve a break . Scott ! Scott , can you hear me ? Sorry , sir , the ice just gave way . Are you hurt ? Negative . I 'm okay , but ... I 'm wedged in pretty good . Good thing , too . Looks like a long way down . All right , just hold on . I 'm going to ... I 'm going to throw a line down . Here it comes . I need you to tell me when you 've got it . Got it . Now , if you can manage it , run it under both your arms and fasten it across your chest . Done this before , too , have you ? Oh , yeah . At least a dozen times . Okay . Now , I want you to pull yourself up . I 'm going to pull from this end . You ready ? Uh , yeah . Okay , one ... two ... three ! Pull ! Pull , Scott ! Come on ! Pull ! Pull ! How stuck are you ? Pretty dang stuck . Is there any way you can dig yourself out ? I 'm not sure . That 's okay . That 's passed . Scott ? Still here , sir . All right , let 's just , uh ... let 's think about this for a second . Destiny , this is Young . Go ahead . We 've got a situation here . There was a tremor , and Scott fell through the snow into a crevasse . He 's fine , but he 's just out of reach . I tried to pull him up , but that 's not going to happen anytime soon . How 's that other space suit coming ? We stopped work on that . I confined everyone to quarters . All right , it was just a thought . We 'll , uh ... we 'll figure it out . How 's your bug situation ? Same as before . Don 't worry about it . Don 't you worry either , T.J. I 'll be out of here in no time . Good luck . Johansen out . Everyone is lying . Yeah , grown-ups do that sometimes . This is Greer . It 's working . They 're moving away from us as we move forward . Good job . Keep it up . How about you lower the gun down , And I shoot myself free ? Yeah , that 's good thinking . There 's no way the bullets will ricochet into your ass . Well , maybe I can cut my way out with the plasma cutter . You get one hole in that suit , you 're dead . Maybe there 's a way for me to get down there . No , that 's just as stupid . " That 's just as stupid , sir . " The last thing we need is for both of us to be stuck down here . You okay ? Uh , closed in a little tighter , but I think ... What ? What ? I think I 'm losing suit pressure . I thought we were supposed to be confined to quarters . Yeah , well , I heard over the radio ... there was a tremor . Lieutenant Scott fell into a crevasse . Oh , my god . He 's okay . Just ... stuck . Do they have enough air ? Colonel Young says he 's got it under control . I just ... thought you would want to know . Thanks . Yeah . I think the ice tore a hole in his suit . How big a tear is it ? I can 't ... I can 't see it , but I can hear it . It 's-it 's hissing out pretty good . An hour at most . Plenty of time to make it back . Yeah , if I wasn 't stuck ! Colonel , you have to consider the amount of time you have left now . I 'm aware of the damn time , Rush . All I 'm saying is if you delay much longer ... Listen to me ! I know exactly what you 're saying , and I 'm not going anywhere without Lieutenant Scott , and that 's the way it 's going to be ! What is the matter with you ? Miss Armstrong , you should return to your quarters . No , you know where you can go ? Look , Colonel , I understand your desire to rescue Lieutenant Scott , of course , and only you can decide how much time you have left , but Lieutenant , if Colonel Young remains there , trying to free you , to pull you up by himself , there 's a chance he might not make it back . He 's right . Just keep the gate active . We 're going to make it back in time with your damn ice , which is all you really care about . Colonel ... Young out ! Damn , he 's a lot of work . This is Greer . I locked them up . Closing off the ventilation in that room . Okay , vents are closed . Should be airtight . What are they doing now ? Looking for a way out . Let 's hope they don 't find one . Come on ! Come on ... Sir ... Colonel ? I 'm thinking . Go . It 's okay . No , it 's not . Come on , sir . We both know you 've done this before , too . Done what ? Lost people . Too many times . I 'm not ... I 'm not doing it again . I ... I can 't let you do it . You don 't have a choice . Not that I 'm counting , but this is the third time in almost as many weeks that you 've been willing to kill yourself , and there 's ... there 's a pretty good chance at this point I won 't be around to talk you out of it again . You 're a fine young officer . You 've got a heart as big as a house , and I 'm not here because I want to die . I 'm here because I haven 't given up on saving your ass , so just shut up and think . They 're gettin ' pissed off . Really pissed off . A few of them got out . What ? How ? We need a plan , Lieutenant ! I 'm coming down there ! This is beautiful out here . Scott ... Lieutenant ... Lieutenant ? Scott ... Scott ! Scott ! Scott ! Wake up , Scott ! Lieutenant ! Wake up ! Scott ! I need you to wake up , Scott ! Scott , come on ! Wake up ! Come on ! Lieutenant ! Come on , I got you . That 's it , pull ! Pull , Lieutenant . Come on , Lieutenant . Lieutenant ! Okay , that 's it . Okay , that 's it , I got you . I got you . Okay ... Okay ... All right ? You 're okay . Hey ... hey , Scott , come on . Hang on , kid . What 's the plan ? We open the door , they go for the water , we close the lid . All right , who 's going to do that ? I am . No , no , no , I will . I 'm not the one with the torch . No , look , I am not going to let you do that ... I 'm not the one who 's killed any of them , Sergeant . You are . I 'll stand back , torch them if they get out . No , I want you out of sight . What , you don 't trust me ? No , I don 't . All right . Eli , I 'm ready . Make us a clear path to the gate room . Seal off everything else . You 're good . If this doesn 't work , lock this compartment off from the rest of the ship . Destiny , this is Young . I 'm on my way back with Scott . Come in . Okay , let ' em out . Okay , I got ' em ! All right , dial the gate . We 're on our way . Destiny ... I 'm almost at the Stargate with Scott . Shut it down so I can ... Dial in . Colonel , we 're about to send these alien bugs through to the planet . We 've no other choice . What ? We need you to step away from the gate and remain as still as possible . They 're coming through now . Get his helmet off . Yeah , I got it . Give her a hand . His pulse is thready , but he 's breathing . Let 's get him out of here . Sergeant Spencer , you step out of line again , I will deal with you personally . Understand ? Yes , sir . I don 't think he does . Colonel , I need to talk to you about the behavior of one of your men ... No , that can wait . We need to go over the new rationing amounts before the next ... Colonel , I was scheduled to use the communication stones this morning ... Colonel ! Colonel ! At approximately 03 : 00 hours ship time , Corporal Gorman succumbed to injuries sustained in an encounter with an alien entity . Lieutenant Johansen did everything that she could . I intend to hold appropriate services tomorrow at 1600 hours . How do I turn it off ?

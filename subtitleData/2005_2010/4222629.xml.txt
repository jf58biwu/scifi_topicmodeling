The leading pack has entered the long long pass . relay units have begun moving on to here at the water stop . REDLINE 's still ever popular amongst the public . Instead of currently mainstream antigravity engine ... Papa ! My money 's on Sonoshee . huh ? I put mine on Deguon . You 're kidding ! I can 't . You stink ! You can squeeze in ! 2358 teams made the entry . Preceding Blue Line has — Who did you bet on ? JP . No way ! Pa ! Where were you ? a battle for the last spot is raging here at Yellow Line . Papa ! This way ! Hurry ! Venue for the REDLINE is still under wraps . Curious to see the result of viewers ' request . REDLINE 's venue will be announced . Get around to the right . Roger . Our own relay unit Portal has just arrived at the final relay point . Papa ! A Portal is here ! It 's a Portal ! Look ! let 's get back to the race and see who 's coming first . quick ! Papa ! Papa ! The lens cap 's on ! Did you see that ? ! So cool ! Only 50 clicks left in the Planet Dorothy Yellow Line . She 's heading straight toward the goal in Crab Sonoshee . Very first REDLINE champion : Captain-2-Block 's Captain the Classic in second . Count Markdie and Spark in their Snake Head . Psychoman Lotten 's Psycho Rod . the second group is coming up fourteen seconds behind them . From planet Supergrass ruled by the Princess with magical powers Deguon 's Fire Bird is leading the group . Right behind her is Planet Dorothy 's own Bons Missile-EP4 . Sweet JP 's Transam is seventh at the very end . The other racers are left way behind . Looks like it 's down to these seven . Though I have my doubts about JP at this stage . you say ? Just trying to make things interesting here . What do you announcers know about racing ? ! JP 's uncorked the nitro on the final stretch ! He 's making a break for it ! He broke away from the second group on a rocket ride ! Crab Sonoshee ls still keeping the leading position . Look out ! JP 's Transam has caught its tail ! Take this ! Look at JP 's splendid move ! The heat is on ! The crowd must be going wild . Captain the Classic moving up on Crab Sonoshee . That punk ! He held back till the last quarter like you said . He 's the odds on favorite near the finish . Frisbee ? JP 's the only one who can pull off a fixed game like this . None of these guys can beat him at the Yellow Line . That 's what you say . do you ? Not a chance . he qualifies for REDLINE . You don 't think he may just decide to go for it ? That won 't happen . I can guarantee that . Cherry Boy Hunter ! Crab Sonoshee 's hover jet takes a chance by diving into the river . You 're not getting away ! I 'll send you all to hell ! Here we go ! the syndicate 's gonna take a big hit . Look . He isn 't called " Sweet JP " for nothing . he wouldn 't risk going back in the joint . huh ? I hope you 're right . Bids are locked . And our position on JP ? All unloaded . Good . Now we 'll see how your friendship with JP plays out . hold it ... Now ! JP finally takes the lead ! Nobody can catch him now . He 's charging toward the finish line on the nitro drive . Yes !

Listen to the crowd ! This completes the lineup of racers for REDLINE . The venue for the big race will be announced shortly . Look . What ? You first . you go . After you . After you . That Transam must cost a fortune . You couldn 't possibly put together a machine like that . You knew exactly what you were getting into . You 're off the hook with your bondsman now . That should cover your hospital bill and more . I 'd say it 's a win-win . Racers and mechanics gotta stick together . You and I make a good team . Always have . Call me when you wanna get in the game again . you know . watch out ! You crazy ? I changed my mind . It 's all yours . What 's this ? An attack of principles ? Your bondsman won 't like it .

It 'll be at Roboworld ! Roboworld ? ! You shitting me ? ! My beloved people of M3 nebula ! I shall fight REDLINE that dares to enter our sector .

We will destroy any outsiders who enter our territory by any means necessary ! See ? No chance . The next REDLINE 's gonna be held at Roboworld ... Confirmed just a few minutes ago . Can 't believe they 're allowing this . That 's just it . They 're not . Thought so . That 's why KURUKURU = DAZA and SHOTO = O-JIN dropped out . you know ? There 's no way I 'm gonna race while dodging the bullets . That 's true . not a soldier . I 've had enough of that shit . Not me . Roboworld is an important client of my kingdom . I 'm not ready to give up my life just yet . the top two teams were picked . I see ... Are you going ... or will you drop out ? please make a statement ! Frisbee . will you ? What ? ! then ? He won 't . JP ? Think twice before you say something . Give me the camera . JP ! Roboworld ! Here comes JP ! who qualified for REDLINE . Oh goody ! It 's time for the festival of fools again !

Secretary Titan ! Sir ! You must have something to report ! I just received a message from our scout vessels . They identified a group of ships on Europass 's surface . Europass ? Yes . the planet we donated to those pathetic refugees . It 's demilitarized under our treaty with M3 Nebula Federation . That means our forces must tread very carefully there . the refugees from nearby sectors have drifted in and set up slums all over the place . It 's an ideal hideout for REDLINE racers . This is what we get for being so generous ! They have the audacity to claim it being the viewers ' request . Don 't they know we can 't put our military secrets at risk ? No way we 'd allow a stupid race in such a sacred place ! Mr. President . sir ? Mr. President ! What ? are you ? I am the rule ! All those affiliated are guilty and deserve to be hanged !

Stuffed with cash . It 's for the Transam . He used to drop everything to work on your machine . He sure has changed . me and everything else . Cigs cost more and good junk joints are harder to find . So where 's my wheels ? ingrate . What were you thinking using the nitro twice ? You have a death wish ? I need three caps for the REDLINE . Three ! watch it ! I 'm going up against a bunch of hard cases . aren 't I ? You want an edge ? Then get your machine armed up . You know that anything goes at REDLINE .

I wish I could do more . you listening to me ? Frisbee can handle the redesigning and tune-up . You 're joking ! Why ? When was the last time you two worked as a team ? Stop it . Frisbee 's not legit anymore . I said stop it ! He 's sold out . He 's no good ! Talking about the fix ? right ? but getting mixed up with that scum is another story . Racers and mechanics gotta stick together . You and I make a good team . Always have . Frisbee . I was wondering when you 'd show . you know . Don 't judge a man 's skill by his character . Frisbee ? old man . If I didn 't have the touch . I wouldn 't still be here . Nobody 's worried about your touch . Old man 's on board . I didn 't agree on anything . quit that ! I guess I 'll leave it to the two of you now . Hey ! Where are you going ? Old man will get a new engine . Frisbee takes care of redesign and mods . I 'll do my job when I put my butt behind the wheel . I 'll leave everything to you pros . Like the old days . He think he 's cool or something ? What do you want ? punk !

I didn 't get to see the finish line . do you ? Machine 's gonna be too heavy . You can 't win . I will ! We 'll win this together . but I have to ask you something . Ask me later . We 've got a race to run . No . I need to ask you now . shoot . Have you been arrested for fixing a race ? Yeah . What happened ? It was the Yellow MAX series eight years ago . Our team was on a hot winning streak . so he could get a better engine and parts . I entered the race with his life on the line ... and I lost . he desperately needed the money . But there was a sting operation against the Inuki gang . Frisbee was trapped . That friggin ' Frisbee 's gonna get JP killed ! So you went to prison for him . He believed in me and risked his life so I could race . I always owe him for that . Then we 'll just have to pay him back with this race ! You 're gonna help me ? If you 're gonna help my dream come true . It 's a deal ! He 's got a self-renewal ability . Must have been some pieces of him left . Secretary Titan ! Fire the hyper-disintegrator cannons again ! Negative . We need another two hours to recharge it . Where 's Volton now ? I never thought I 'd see the day . Is it ready ? it 's ready ! Can we control it ? no problem . don 't you ? Very well .

 Hey , I 'm John Worth , I 'm the executive producer of The Sarah Connor Chronicles . Hi , I 'm James Middleton , I 'm executive producer of the pilot of Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , and consulting producer . Hi , my name is Josh Friedman , I 'm creator and executive producer of Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . What you 're gonna look at here is an earlier version of " The Demon Hand . " It 's about eight or nine minutes longer than what we actually aired . One of the things that we wanted to do most adamantly was to show aspects of Sarah Connor 's character that we hadn 't seen before . In " The Demon Hand " we get to hear an extensive monologue about Sarah Connor 's childhood . It tells us a lot about what makes up her point of view about machines and how she looks at her life . I 'm mostly proud of the fact that Lena Headey did it all in one take or two takes of it , total , and she did a beautiful job. I wish it was in there . And there 's some wonderful extra stuff between Dr. Silverman and Ellison . All in all it 's a very lyrical , thoughtful episode that gets even more so with the extra footage , so I 'm happy that it 's here and I hope you like it . This way , come on ! Get these lights on ! They say that when a person dies , the soul lives on . The soul . The thing that separates us from the machines . Cameron had burned the metal monster . Two thousand degrees . I suppose they did the same to Andy . There was nothing left of either . Nothing that told the story of who or what they were . Gone is gone . Ashes to ashes , dust to dust . When I go , bury me in the earth . - The Triple-8 ? - Vaporized . The Russian , Dmitri ? - You found him ? - He took off after Andy 's murder . Now , if he has the Turk , then ... . Put the machine on it . She 'll find him . - It 's- - - I know . It 's what they do . - How is he ? - Better . Still pretty out of it . Is he gonna stay here ? Or what ? And somewhere in this city , a naked cop bleeds in an alley . The hand . Couldn 't acquire it . - Why not ? - The fbi has it . You 're playing hooky . Today ? No , I can 't miss class today , Mom . We have to find the hand . Destroy it . No loose ends . Cyberdyne built Skynet . - With the chip , remember ? - And the hand . Look , the feds have it now , Mom . I can 't help . Besides , absent gets me on the radar . I can play hooky . Find Dmitri . Derek says he has a sister , teaches ballet . Start with her . Low profile , no guns . You might wanna change . Yeah , this is Sergeant Johnson , Senior Property over at L.A.P.D. Got a problem , wonder if you could help . - What 's going on ? - We got this new booking officer , rookie . I think he was drunk when he logged evidence on a robbery we had . Might have ended up on your felony escape . - What are you missing ? - Prosthetic hand . - Really ? - Really . DR number ? 084476732 . - I can send someone to pick it up . - Set of cuffs , switchblade pliers , industrial pipe ... . - Mm . I don 't see any hand on here . - You sure ? Item 17 . - Hey , hang on a second . Agent Ellison . - Yeah ? I got L.A.P.D. Property on the line . Asking about a hand . From your felony escape . They have it listed on the authorization but we don 't have a record of it . I never saw any hand , fake or otherwise . Agent in charge says he never saw it . Wanna talk to him ? No . No , no , I 'll take his word . Thanks . You 're in my seat . Mr. Oxferod , where are you supposed to be ? - Gym . - Get there . - Ohm 's Law states that the current ... . - Is he bugging you ? - No . - It looked like he was bugging you . Mr. Bower , am I to assume that you have no interest in Ohm 's Law ? No , sir , I love Ohm 's Law . It 's my favorite of all the laws . All right . Everyone place one finger on the contact on your light bulb . Now take the hand of your lab partner . Ah . And there you have it , people . A closed electrical circuit . That 's really lame , huh ? Yeah . So , what do you wanna talk about today , Sarah ? When I was 7 years old I would ride my bike down to this dinky five-and-dime drugstore called Ben Franklin 's . I 'd go down there with my best friend , Janey Tepper . She lived across the street . Her dad worked for IBM , he was an engineer or something so she always had more money than I did . My dad lost his job at the mattress factory where he worked . The family who owned it went fully automated and cut back on the loaders and stuffers . My dad was a stuffer . He didn 't do too well without a job . And my mom didn 't do too well having him around all the time . Got a little rough . I had started spending more time at Janey 's house after school . And one morning I woke up and my dad was gone . Some men aren 't meant for hard times . My mom got a job waiting tables , and I stopped going to the store . Instead , I 'd ride over to the mattress factory . I 'd spent hours in there just staring at the gears and the belts . The big , greasy black machines . And even as a child , I knew something horrible was in there , something inhuman . And one day , after I had been in there for hours I must have got lost in it . Because when I hurried home I was late . I snuck in through the back door and I found my mom sitting in my father 's chair and she was crying . And after everything she 'd been through , I had never seen her cry . And that is terrifying for a child . Before I could ask her what was wrong , she said , " Janey . " And she pointed out the front window . And there was a police car and an ambulance and Janey 's little bike laying in the middle of the street . Metal was all twisted up like its back was broken . And it hit me in my 7-year-old brain that somehow it was my fault . Somehow , I should never have stopped riding with her . Somehow , I should have stopped my dad from leaving . And it haunted me as I grew up . I would think of her and wonder if I had failed her . And now ... . Now I cannot help but sit in this tiny , white room you have me locked in and wonder if God or the devil , or even death itself was sending me a message from the future , all the way back through time : " Machines , Sarah , machines . You can ride and you can run and you can hide and you can pretend they 're not coming but they 're coming . And they are faster and stronger . And they have been built to do one thing . One perfect thing : To kill you . To kill you , and your friends and your family and your mother and your father and Janey Tepper and Kyle Reese and your son . Your son . They will kill everyone you love , everyone you hold close and there is nothing you can do about it . Nothing . Because they are coming and they will find you . Because that 's what they do . That 's all they do . " - All they do ! All they do . - I need help here ! - Come on , where 's that shot ? - They will kill you ! Kill you ! Thank you . This is where Sarah Connor spent three years of her life ? This is it . Dr. Silberman retired right after she escaped . Where is he these days ? Got himself a cabin in the mountains near Arrowhead . Growing his own vegetables and working on his book . Living the good life . We don 't hear much from him anymore . I 'd love to talk to any staff that was here when she escaped . - Unfortunately , there 's no one left . - No one ? Not even the janitor ? How long would you work here if you could find another job ? You 're still here . I never cared much for the mountains . All right . And ... . Knees over toes . Elbows up . Hips down . Face front . Don 't roll your instep . Baby toes on the ground . Good . Go on , reach down . You should be able to put teacup on your heel and serve it . Excellent turn out . Hold . Hold . And close . Beautiful . Thank you . See you all next week . What is she doing ? Pas de chat . Step of the cat . - will you show me ? - That is the advanced class . You are a beginner , yeah ? Please ? Show me ? The right foot jumps up left foot meets it in the air , right foot lands left foot closes fifth . Retiré preparation fourth plié , double pirouette and finish . But remember , move like the cat . Think like the cat , yeah ? Thank you for explaining . You have taken ballet before . No . The height is nice . Beautiful feet . But your upper body is little mechanical , yeah ? Remember , you are a cat . I 'm a cat . Come next week . We need to develop your flexibility and your imagination . Remember , dance is the hidden language of the soul , yeah ? Stop coming here . Where is he ? Don 't play with me , Maria . Please leave . What are you doing ? What 's it look like ? Looks like you 're loading guns that I know for a fact are already loaded . True enough . By me . I loaded them . Look no offense , I just don 't like firing a weapon I didn 't set myself . Anyway , you should take it into the kitchen or something . Mom wouldn 't like you doing this in her room . Why ? Because it 's her room . Listen , um the paramedic that patched me up , where 'd he come from ? That 's Charlie . He was her boyfriend . Her fiancé actually . Long time ago though . He 's a liability . Look , man , he 's not gonna tell anybody . How do you know ? Because I know him. I trust him . I can 't believe you trust anybody . Maybe it 's just him . You trust the machine . - Cameron , she- - - Yeah , Cameron . What a joke . Walking around with a name like it 's a person . It 's not a person. lt 's not something you should be trusting . What 's going on ? Nothing . I need you to get on the computer and find an address . You 're making a mistake . - How 's that ? - The machine has gotta go . You had me sending her out to do our dirty work . Dirty work is all they 're good for . Don 't think that you can train them like a pet . It 'lI be the last thing you think . - John-- - John doesn 't know everything . - You should be resting . - No . They never rest . You can 't have that thing here . Can 't sleep with it here . That gonna help ? You never know . Does it help to sleep on the whole trunk ? Go into my bedroom again , I 'll bust your head . What happened with the ballet teacher ? Dance is the language of the soul . First , you have to have a soul . I mean , about Dmitri or the Turk . I 'm going back today . - What 's the status on the hand ? - Got a good idea who has it . - Who ? - fbi Agent Ellison . The guy who questioned me in county lockup ? What , they only have one fbi agent in this town ? The only one who could put this whole thing together . From what I saw at his house , maybe he already has . Pancakes . We eat at the table . - Your pancakes are getting cold . - Here 's Dr. Silberman 's address . - You 're not hungry ? - No . Since when ? Miss Connor , I 'm from DCFS . I 've brought some paperwork . Everything should be in order . All we have to do is cross the T 's and dot the I 's . It states that you voluntarily and unequivocally consent . You 've been advised of the consequences of this relinquishment . You understand that your consent is irrevocable . And once these papers are signed , all parental rights will be terminated . And sign here . We 'll get a certified copy to the judge . I guess you 're not hungry either . You might have fooled them , but not me . I know you . I know you too . Can I help you ? Special Agent James Ellison . Well , hello . What can I do for you , agent ? I 'd like to talk to you about Sarah Connor . You like to come in ? Thank you . How 's your tea ? - Very good , thank you . - It 's organic it 's lemon verbena . Grow it myself . - Really ? - Yeah . It 's true what they say . Something about digging your fingers in the earth ... . No phones , no TV , no technology . Just man and nature . - Sorry , I don 't mean to bore you . - No , no . You 're not boring me , doctor . A man 's gotta have hobbies . What are yours ? Mine ? Uh ... . Um ... . I guess I don 't have any . Well , you must not have much time in your line of work . The Sarah Connors of the world keep me pretty busy . Sarah Connor kept a lot of people busy . So tragic what happened to her . I 've been revisiting her case . Watched some interview tapes from Pescadero . - Well , she was a complicated woman . - But was she crazy ? Gut feeling . Off the record . Well , what does it matter ? It was many years ago , she 's gone now . Maybe she 's becoming my hobby . I don 't like to use the term " textbook " in relation to any of my patients but Sarah Connor was depressed , anxiety-ridden manic violent with paranoid delusions . Is that what it was ? Delusions ? Robots , soldiers of the future , apocalypse . You tell me . Also , she could be remarkably charming and even persuasive . Beware of false prophets . Are you a man of the Book ? It has brought me comfort at times . Is that what you think ? That she was some sort of prophet ? I was hoping you could answer that for me , doctor . More tea ? Um . Yes , yes , thank you . The thing that most people don 't understand about psychiatry is that it is an imperfect science . What are you doing here ? Watching you . I 'm a little out of shape . Teaching takes all my time . My brother says if you wanna be good at anything , you have to practice every day . Your brother is right . Do you have a brother ? Yes . Is he a dancer like you ? He plays chess . So does my brother . Excuse me . I can see to it that you never dance again . I can see to it ... Get lost . Do you have any idea who this is ? No , do you ? Who are you ? You are just a girl . How did you do that ? I 'm looking for your brother . Are you police ? I 've already told the police everything I know . No , I 'm not police . But I do find them useful . What do you want ? I can help your brother . tell me where he is . I was in Russia . No money , no papers . Dmitri said he would pay for me to come here . He borrowed money from some bad people . He paid them back , but it wasn 't enough . Now they want to kill him . Untie me . FBI , that 's a good touch . What ? Who- - ? Who do you- - ? Who do you think I am ? I know who you are ... - Yes . - Yeah . Matthew 7 : 15 , the full verse is : Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep 's clothing but inwardly , they are ravening wolves . You 're from the future . - You 're one of them . - I 'm- - ? I 'm- - ? Oh , come on . Come on ! Okay , if I was who you say I am , then how could- - ? How could you have poisoned me ? The tea was a test but then it occurred to me that you could be an advanced model . Smart enough to trick me into thinking you were passed out . Oh , come on . Come on . Look . Look , kidnapping an fbi agent is a federal offense . Carries a sentence of life in prison . If you let me go now , we 'll forget this ever happened , okay ? - One sure-fire way to- - - Wait . Wait , wait . No ! No ! You can 't . No ! No ! John hasn 't been answering his cell phone . When he gets home , will you tell him we need to talk ? Where you heading ? Arrowhead . I think Ellison might be there . He 's a strong boy . You know , strong opinions . - I don 't know where he gets that . - His father ? Out of the picture . That 's too bad . Can I ask you about my brother ? Kyle ? John told me he died fighting ? Do you know where he is now ? In the grass . It 's an honest mistake . Can 't be too careful . You know , there was a hiker that came to the door a while back . He was asking directions . I thought it was a ruse , thought it was one of them . I gave him some tea . A little too strong . Honest mistake . tell me do you believe in the apocalypse , agent ? Um ... . Yeah . I 've read Revelation . Could it be that the apocalypse in the Book and the predictions of Sarah Connor are one and the same ? Um , I suppose it 's possible . What do you think ? He came down the hall . It was a large man . He threw the guard through the window just like a rag doll . Not an ounce of emotion , just blank like a death mask . Then the other one came . There was two of them ? They were different . The second one was almost beautiful , like , perfect like a changeling . The face of mercury . What about Sarah ? She was there . She was on the floor and the boy was with her . He was screaming . And then the first one , the big one I 'll never forget , he reached out his hand and he said : " Come with me ... . " It was like God reaching out to man like the Sistine Chapel . The hand of God . Hand of God . Yeah . Though there 's no proof , so we don 't talk about it all of us who were there . What if I told you I have proof ? What do you mean ? Piece of evidence I found during my investigation . That 's why I came to you . For your cooperation . To show you that Sarah wasn 't crazy . Nobody is crazy . What is it ? The hand of God . It 's a good thing you told me about this . Yeah . I told you , I 'm on your side . I wish that were true . What does that mean ? Do you know what would happen if the wrong people got ahold of this ? I can 't let you stop her . She 's dead . Well , so was Jesus once . - You won 't feel a thing . - What ? No , no ! Dug up some clean T-shirts for you . Thanks . I wasn 't sure how many you 'd need . Depends on how long you 're staying . Not that great sleeping on the couch , is it ? Slept on a few of them myself . Yeah ? When was that ? When my mom was locked up . I kicked around . Friends and foster families . Mom was in prison ? Mental hospital . You go around blowing up buildings and ranting about robots , it happens . That sounds rough . There was this- - There was this one family , Todd and Janelle . I was with them for a while and they were okay . Of course , I hated them . They wanted to adopt me . I 'm sure your mom would have died before she let that happen . Yeah , you 'd think . Look , John what can happen to a person inside four walls screws with your head . Makes you do things you never thought you 'd do . Some people never give up . Some people always fight . Fewer than you 'd think . So you ever wonder what happened to Todd and Janelle ? No . I know what happened . I got them killed . Dima . - Who is she ? - My friend . She can help us . What are you thinking ? tell him , come on . I have money . You 're the one who reported the Turk missing . - Do you have more ? - What happened to it ? A man came to see me . Offered me money to steal the Turk . I owed money to the people who helped me bring my sister into this country so I changed the endgame protocols in order for it to lose its last match . If we 'd won and we would have won , I never could have gotten it out of there . I was paid money for it , $ 20,000 . It wasn 't enough . I need more of these . Please , I need more of these . Who bought the Turk ? Okay . That 's all I have . Okay ? Dima . Thank you for explaining . Where are you going ? Hey , where do you go ? You promised you 'd help us ! Hey . Where are you going ? - Hey ! - Ah ! Oh , my God . I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . Apology accepted . Get up . Where is it ? She took it . What ? Who ? Sarah Connor . She took it . She took it . Did you find the Turk ? Dmitri stole it from Andy then sold it to a man . Who ? Where 's Dmitri now ? Dead . So 's his sister . Did you kill them ? No . It wasn 't my mission . I never wanted you to see that tape . I was gonna destroy it . But since you did , did you notice the date ? The date on the tape ? June 8 , 1997 . Do you know that date ? I do now . It 's the date you gave up being my mother . It 's the date I broke out of there . The day you came for me , the day I was coming for you . Because about three seconds after I signed that paper I knew I couldn 't live with it . I was coming for you and I was gonna die trying . You almost did . So did you . And you were mad as hell about it . Yelled at me and told me what a stupid move it was . I might have oversold that a little . I 'll always find you . I 'll always find you . There was a time I was a hero to my son . He thought I walked on water . He knows better now . We all have weak moments moments where we lose faith . But it 's our flaws our weaknesses that make us human . They 're here . They 're here . They 're here ! They 're everywhere ! They 're here ! They 're here ! Science now performs miracles like the gods of old . Creating life from blood cells or bacteria or a spark of metal . But they 're perfect creatures and in that way , they couldn 't be less human . There are things machines will never do . They cannot possess faith , they cannot commune with God . " Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit . A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit . Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire . " They cannot appreciate beauty . They cannot create art . If they ever learn these things , they won 't have to destroy us . They 'll be us .

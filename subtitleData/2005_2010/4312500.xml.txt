 Previously on Heroes : Thank God you came along . I know Dr. Suresh . I can take you to him . Right after we defeat his entire army . She won 't wake up , her vitals are worse . - I am taking her to the company . - The moment you trust them with what you care about most , they 'll have you . We have someone else who needs us . We would like you to bring her in . A lot of the people we encounter aren 't in control of their ability . We need you out there , doing the good work you do , helping others like her . You were with a boy . There 's no boy , Dad . I tried out for cheerleading . - You promise me that you won 't date . - OK . I painted that , but all the street signs are in French . It could be Montréal . Ricky ! The woman who did this to Ricky , she was looking for me . I 'm so sorry . I shouldn 't have let him cover for me . It was his choice , Peter . My brother could be a right fool sometimes . The woman who killed Ricky was looking for me . I 'm not gonna let you be next . I 'm gonna find her , find out who she is , what she wants . - How are you planning on doing that ? - The plane ticket , the painting . It all points to Montréal . It 's a start . - I 'm going with you . - No . I 'm not risking your life too . We were both in that Montréal painting . I think I 'm supposed to go with you . Besides , when you find Ricky 's killer , I want to be there . - What for ? - To kill the bitch . One , two , three , four ... R - E-C-Y-C-L-E ! Five , six , seven , eight ... It 's our planet , let 's plant a tree ! Whoo ! - Go Costa Verde ! - Stop , please ! I can 't take it anymore . Do you realise how agonizing it is to watch you people ? It 's a no on all three . - Next ! - Are you crazy ? Claire was awesome . I vote yes . OK , that 's one vote for Claire . Anyone else care to climb out on a limb with May ? Like I said , next ! Thanks for trying . Claire , you were amazing . Really . I don 't know what Debbie 's thinking . What I 'm thinking is that Costa Verde High deserves cheerleaders that are extra-ordinary . And you , Claire , are simply not extra-ordinary . How was that ? Perfect yet again . How much longer are we gonna do this ? It 's been hours . - I want to go home . - Soon , I promise . Let 's take a break . Are you ever gonna tell me what 's going on here ? Where are we ? I mean , you just grabbed me off the street ... You 're in Hartsdale , New York , at a privately funded company whose sole purpose is to help you and others like you . - Others like me ? - Not exactly like you . Others have different gifts , you 're the first we 've met - with adoptive muscle memory . - So that 's what it 's called . Why is this happening to me ? We 're not really sure . There are certain genetic markers . Where they come from is still a mystery . You have been given an extraordinary gift . I agree . You are a very special person , Miss Dawson . - Who are you ? - My name is Bob . I 'm in charge of operations . Doctor , could I see you for a moment ? Have you established a reliable baseline for Miss Dawson 's ability ? Yes . She is able to replicate any action . - It 's really quite extraordinary . - Good . Now , we could determine if this stops all of that . - What is that ? - A variant of the Shanti virus . You 're experimenting with the virus ? Manipulating a live virus is essential for creating a vaccine , doctor . We hope to use this virus to take away Monica 's ability without harming her . You could create an incurable strain . It can cross to the general population . Think how many people were killed by Gabriel Gray . There are some abilities in this world that must be stopped at any cost . Monica is a sweet girl who loves her abilities . - We can 't just take them away from her . - It 's for the greater good . So she 's a lab rat . You 're just going to inject her without her consent . No , Dr Suresh , you are . It 's a mutated strain , manufactured . If the biological structure of the virus has been altered , I don 't know if I can save her . She could die . You 'll have to take that chance . I never agreed to experiment on people . You brought them Molly , didn 't you ? - I didn 't know what else to do . - Look . If you refuse to do this , they 'll get rid of you , then we 're gonna lose everything we 've been trying to do . And worse yet , you 're gonna lose Molly . Now you 've got principles and that 's fine . But to bring down this company , sometimes we have to do bad things . Don 't disappoint me , Suresh . Ivan . Something wrong ? I lied to my dad . The other night when I went home , I told him I 'd joined cheerleading . Cheerleading ? That is bad . You don 't understand . Cheerleading tryouts were last period . I didn 't make it . What am I supposed to tell him ? You met this awesome guy and need some free time to make out . My dad 's really overprotective about the dating thing . He told me I couldn 't date until I was 21 . - So ? - So I have to listen , don 't you ? Claire , I can fly . It kind of makes the whole parental guidance thing a non-issue . We 'll figure out a way to get you on the team . It 's impossible . Debbie Marshall does not deem me extra-ordinary enough . That 's ridiculous . You 're a total babe , and you have a power . By definition , you 're better than she is . You 're sweet . But it 's not just her . She 's got that whole squad wrapped around her evil little pinky . I knew girls just like her at my old school . All it would take is one person to stand up to her . Well , be that person . Take her down a notch . - How ? - You were a cheerleader . What do they fear most ? Public humiliation ? We could give her a taste of her own medicine . Your ability is fascinating . A gift . What I do is terrible . I have taken many lives , and I can 't control it . I was like you . I could do things , amazing things . You ? Like what ? I could move objects with my mind . I could hear a pin drop from miles away . But then it all just went away . That 's why I need to see Dr Suresh , to get them back . You want to be different ? I want to be special , unique . An ability doesn 't have to be a burden , Maya . It can be wonderful . Is there a problem ? My brother wants to hire a coyote , to cross the border without you . Why ? You can 't trust them . It 's OK . We 'll cross the border together . I 'm glad to have found you , Gabriel . Isaac Mendez painted a series of eight paintings beginning with Kaito Nakamura 's death and ending in mine . Where are they ? Sorry , I 'm retired . I work in the textile factory now . Regional manager of sales , like you in the paper company . Cut the crap . Where are the paintings ? You think you intimidate me ? I trained you , you and your invisible partner Claude . I taught you everything ! Then you know what I 'm capable of . Don 't make me do this . What is this ? You want information ? - The Haitian can 't help you . - My friend has a new trick . He can reach inside that company-Ioving head of yours and one by one blot out all the memories you hold most dear . Think about it , a man of your advanced years . Treasured memories give your life meaning . Your wedding in Capri . The births of Andrei and Mikhail . It 'd be a shame if they disappeared , lost forever . Start with the day he met his wife . Boat ride on the Danube , wasn 't it ? Tell me about Katerina . Your honeymoon . Her favourite flower . I can 't remember . Really ? After 35 years together , such a shame . Are you ready to talk , or do we keep going ? Hi , honey . Is everything all right ? Hey , Dad , yeah . I was just wondering if I could borrow the car tonight . - Did you ask your mother ? - I did . She said to ask you . I 'll be with the cheerleaders later . Just thought you should know . Full disclosure and all . Well , that 's very responsible of you , Claire . Take the car . But do one thing for me . Sure . Lock the doors this time . I will . Thanks . Is there something else ? Where are you right now ? I told you . Management training in Tulsa . And I 'm late for a session . I thought you had to work there a year before they 'd send you . I 'm a quick learner . I 've gotta go . I love you , Claire-Bear . I love you too , Dad . What do you think ? OK . I 'm in . Your daughter Claire ? It must be very difficult for her , the constant fear of discovery , especially for a teenager . Aren 't you tired of running ? I 'm protecting her from animals like you . You can 't hide forever . Take all his memories of me , my family , Claire , everything I ever told him . - He remembers nothing ! - Wait ! I 'm like you . Family comes first . Maybe we can make a deal . - What kind of deal ? - You were my protege , so dedicated to the company , you made me proud . I miss that . - I want you back . - Forget it . The company has changed . We have new directives . Come back to us and you 'll be safe , all of you . You have my word . - What about the paintings ? - You 'll be told everything . I can give you your life back . Trust me . What is that ? A border fence , not finished yet . That is America right there . Attention , you 're in violation of U.S. Immigration ! We have notified Border Patrol . All right , boys , let 's see them hands . - Who are they ? - They 're locals , not border patrol . Fake police . Drive around them . What 's ... What 's that for ? A cholinergic . It 's standard procedure to see if your ability improves . Uh-uh , no way . I won 't do needles . It 's the last phase of your testing . One shot , you can go home . Fine . Just make it fast . I can 't do this . Dr Suresh ? I won 't do it . If you don 't , someone else will . And there 's more where that came from . Stop ! What are you doing ? ! Get someone else to do your research . I 'm taking Molly and I 'm leaving . All right , boys , this is your last warning . Vámonos . - We have to go . - They will shoot us . Just drive , now ! No , no , no , no , no . Let her alone . We need to get past these men , these guns . You can use your gift . No . Drive . The next time you think of that second helping of Chunky Monkey , remember one thing . The Sharpie doesn 't lie . Appearance matters , girls . - Is this really necessary ? - Hell , yes . I might have to basket catch one of these tubettes . Debbie , can I talk to you for a minute ? Private function , Butler . Cheerleaders only . I 'll do your biology homework for a week . You have five minutes . I want another chance , another shot at tryouts . I appreciate the effort , really . Attempting to better your social status at school is very American dream of you . But everyone has their place in this world . Deal with it . - So you 're not gonna change your mind ? - You are slow , aren 't you ? Claire ? Claire ? ! Oh , my God . She was right there . Her neck was twisted . She was bleeding . I went to see if I could help her . That 's when he came after me . - The flying masked man ? - Yes ! I escaped , thank goodness , but Claire was dead , right there on the steps . I saw her . She 's ... What 's going on ? But I saw you . That thing dropped you . Debbie , calm down . I 'm fine . I don 't supposed you saw a flying masked man this evening ? Me ? No . No . Uh , I was just hanging out with Debbie . Find anything , Ray ? No dead bodies . I did find this . How much have you had to drink tonight , Miss Marshall ? She 's so busted . We don 't have much time . The sun will rise soon . Yaeko 's father is there . You take out the guard , we will follow . You 've given me purpose , Carp . I 'm really a hero . And more , you 've made me a better man . Well ... You wouldn 't happen to have a swordsmith in there ? I know . It 's really unfair . That was easy enough . You must stop them . Destroy all the guns ! That is how you save Japan . Very well . Can I speak with you for a moment ? I owe you an apology . What I asked you to do was wrong . I 've been with the company for 30 years . We 've been through a lot of turmoil and made a lot of difficult choices , some I regret to this day . But right now I 'm dealing with someone who is a real danger to us , to everyone , and I 'm afraid that in my haste to deal with him , I overstepped my bounds . The file you were holding , Adam Monroe . Yes . You 're valuable to us , Dr Suresh , not just for your blood or your knowledge , but to keep us in line . Molly still isn 't well , so I can 't take her away from here . You 've given me no reason to trust you . I know , I know . We both have a lot at stake . I have someone at my disposal , someone who can make sure there 's no further misunderstandings . Sound good ? I don 't really have a choice , do I ? Alejandro ! I will get something for your lip . I know you don 't understand me . But I want to tell you why I 'm helping you . It 's that delicious power . You see , when I get my ability back , I 'm gonna kill you and your sister . And I 'm gonna take it all . And if I don 't get my ability back , it 's not a total loss . Maya 's learning quickly . She 's a shiny new toy , and she 's all mine . I can 't believe you talked me into that . - What ? - Somebody could have seen us . Relax . No one saw . And no one will ever believe Debbie . Did you see her face ? Classic . Is she gonna be OK ? Definitely . She freaked , but just think of it as a lesson in humility . Claire . Oh . Hope I 'm not interrupting . No , it 's OK . How 's Debbie ? She blew a.13. Drinking on school grounds . Suspended from the cheerleading squad immediately . We have an opening . First practice is Monday after school . You mean it ? I 'm on the team ? Sure . You were the best at try-outs . I 'll just let you two get back to ... whatever . I 'll see you Monday . Tell me something , Ivan . In all the years I 've known you , why have you never mentioned a daughter ? This daughter . She died , didn 't she ? Leukaemia . I 'm so sorry . That must have been so painful . I can 't even imagine losing Claire . To think all you have left of her are your memories . It would be awful if they were taken . Almost as if she never existed . - Please don 't . - Take the daughter . - Don 't leave anything . - Wait ! It 's in the warehouse near the train yard . Where we tagged the liquid man . You 'll find your paintings there . Thank you . Now what ? Your Haitian friend makes sure that 'II I 'll forget that you were ever here ? I wish it were that easy . Once the company discovers your memory loss , they 'll trace it back to the Haitian , which leads to my family . - And I can 't have it . - What are you doing ? You taught me well , my friend . You said , " Make it look as if you were never there . " So now we weren 't . Instead , there was a simple home invasion , a senseless murder . I am offering you a way out . You can stop running ! Shoot me and there is no turning back . You 'll condemn yourself to hell . I know . Kensei , I 've been searching for hours . Come , my friend . We must go back and destroy White Beard 's guns . You want to stop him , do it yourself . Something wrong ? I saw you , Hiro . After I saved the swordsmith , I came after you , afraid something had happened to Yaeko , because I love her . And you , friend , betrayed me . - No . - Yes . You kissed her . - It happened ... by accident . - You accidentally kissed her ? I accidentally fell in love with her , and she with me . I 'm so sorry . So you 've been lying to me all along . First you show me that I can be harmed by no weapon , and then you cut me deeper than any blade possibly could . She 's your princess , Kensei . I know that . And I swear I will not give in to love . That kiss will be our last . But the fate of the world still rests in our hands . We must stop White Beard . All right , Carp . Let 's go . You 're covered at work and at home , an impromptu Burger Bonanza training seminar at corporate . Here . - What 's this ? - Information . Phone numbers . If you have any questions or concerns , I want you to call us anytime , day or night . Also , here . It 's fully loaded . Anything from martial arts to plumbing , any skill you want is now at your fingertips . Wow . Support , advice , and now gifts . You 're like my own personal Oprah . You have an amazing gift . So look around . Seems to me like this town could use a little amazing . Thanks . Right . Hello , Dr Suresh . Niki ? - How are you ? - I 'm feeling better now . Back to my old self , thanks to the company . In fact , I 'm gonna be working with them for a while . So you 're ... Your new partner . I know . It 's the last place that I expected to be , but ... I owe these people so much . Bob told me that you two were having some trust issues . He just wants me to make sure that there 's no more misunderstandings . That 's OK , isn 't it ? What does it mean ? - Are you ready ? - Yeah . What is this place ? I don 't know . Someone knew I was coming . " We were right about the company . The world is in danger . It 's up to us . Adam . " The name Adam doesn 't ring a bell ? No , and I don 't know about any company . I don 't know about any of this . " The world is in danger . ' , What am I supposed to do ? We 'll figure it out . Please tell me who I am , what the future holds . Peter , how did we ? I don 't know . We 're in New York . Where is everyone ? It 's an evacuation order . June 14 , 2008 . This is next year .

We 're backing up in here . And I only got two hands , Carter . Where the hell 's DG ? Carter 's looking for you . He 's mad . He 's not the only one . DG ! Sorry , Carter . Bad enough Evie 's got to run to take care of that potato-head son of hers during the lunch rush , but now we got you perfecting the art of being late . Carter ! Guy on four wants a slice of french apple and a chunk of cheddar . It won 't happen again . A lot of people would fight for a job like this . Your future 's in the here and now , kid . Don 't throw it away . Yeah , right . I 've seen the line stretching across the prairie for this stepping stone . Fellow who wanted pie asked for you special , DG . Table four . Well , you just going to stand there ? Go . Go , go . This isn 't my day . Sure isn 't . Thank you . Oh , for god 's sakes ! That bad , popsicle ? Barometer 's falling , the wind 's rising , and I can 't get these new turbines to throw a watt . The spinner in Milltown was never as complicated as this . Well , everything 's better in Milltown , right ? Well , I did have to walk three miles through the snow to get to school . Heard you tossing and turning again last night . Oh , yeah . Your creepy cave nightmare again ? Yeah , it was different this time . I wasn 't alone . There was a woman there . She had the most beautiful lavender eyes I 've ever seen . Liz taylor ? No , here . Actually , I drew a picture of her . Whoa ... she could escort me through my dreams any night . She said , " a storm is coming . " What storm ? I don 't know . I 'll ask for clarification next time . Whoa-ho-ho , all right . Elmer gulch is a menace to the community . Menace or no , he is an officer of the law . You 're going to have to face the judge . Officer gulch wants you in jail . He doesn 't want me in jail . He wouldn 't have anybody to chase then . This is not a joke . We 'll be lucky if they just impound your bike . Then can 't impound my bike if I take off on it . I was wondering if you were planning a trip . You went through my stuff ? She 's been worried . We both have . You 've been acting strange , distant . If you spend your every spare moment drawing your pictures , dreaming of another life , you 're going to wind up never living the one you got . But this isn 't my life . This town , that job taking other people 's orders , that 's just passing time . There has to be more to life than this . And you really think you 'll find better out there ? Look , I love you guys , I just don 't feel at home here . I don 't think I ever have . Our job in this world has been to be the best parents that we can be . And it 's one we 've done proper , but she 's a young woman now . DG is having the dream . Knock knock ! You know your mom loves you more than anything in this world . I know . I just ... wish that she understood how I felt . You know , you 're as good an artist as you are a mechanic . The world 's going to be your oyster ... someday . I remember when I was in Milltown - dad , could you please stop talking about your perfect childhood in Milltown ? This is real life . Harass your old man all you want . These sketches remind me of home . No matter where we find ourselves , home is where your heart is . I can 't stay here forever . There 's a place and a time when we learn where we 're supposed to be . And you 're almost there ... and ... don 't forget , all of life 's answers - " are found along the old road . " I remember . How about the one about the daughter of light who searches for her home - frozen in time in the sea of ice . You got to get some new material , dad . And you 've got to realize that I 'm not a little girl anymore . You 'll always be my baby girl . General ... my search teams have returned from the northern guilds empty-handed . She will be less than happy . She always is . You made me a promise . Unfortunately , there were complications with the resistance spies in the north . A slight delay , sorceress . That 's all . The emerald , Lonot . Where 's my emerald ? We will double our efforts , close the vice even tighter . All I need is a little more time . There is no more time . In seven days , the double eclipse will darken our skies . If I don 't have the emerald in my hand by then , everything I have worked so hard for ... all of this ... will be lost . We will have it ? I give you my word . Something wrong , sorceress ? I need to see Lylo . Peer into the future . Tell me if there 's anything that will hinder my plans . It hurts Lylo to look . It will hurt more if you don 't . Those who resist you will continue to be conquered . The emerald , Lylo , will I find it in time ? Where is it ? Lylo knows not , but before the eclipse , in your hand , it will be . It will be ! Do you see anything that will stand in my way ? Lylo see nothing , but ... but what ? Lylo feels ... a presence . A glimmer of light in the darkness . Light from the other side . The other side ? General lonot ... awaken a travel storm . Take a small company of men , and just slip through to the other side . Find this light and extinguish it . A storm is coming ! A storm is coming ! A storm is coming ... wind must be shorting out the power . Where is she ? Dad ! Are you okay ? No , DG , go back ! Ow ! Go , go , go ! Ah ! Dad , come on ! Get this thing off ! Dad , are you okay ? Yea I 'm fine . Turn this around . Push it down the stairs . Go , go ! Dad , who are those guys ? Longcoats . What ? This wasn 't the way it was planned . I know , but it 's our only chance . We have to take her there now . Take me where ? There 's no time to explain , DG . Dad , what are you doing ? Grab me ! You have to jump ! No ! You have to jump ! No ! We need to go , DG ! The longcoats are after you ! What ? Why ? Because it 's time ! Time for what ? Are you doing ? You have to trust us ! Mom ! Dad ! Where am I ? Hello ! Hello ! Beware ... oh , you have to be kidding me . Watchful . Be watchful . I like not the look of her . Back off , jack ! And gaze not into her eyes , for fear she 'll turn you into a skree . Who are you ? I 'm DG . Who are you ? I am red hatt . We are resistance fighters of the eastern guild . Do not speak of who we be . We know not of her trickery . Trickery ? My parents are missing . I 'm the victim of some sort of a natural disaster . Creatures do not fall from the sky lacking magic . Mobats fall from the sky . Mobats have wings ! Wings or not , she 's a spy ! A spy from the sky ! No , I 'm not a spy . I 'm not a spy . Get her to the camp . Stop your worrying . Of course the people of the O.Z .. Will be taken care of . I never said that-you did - no , you didn 't . Don 't say that . Perhaps we should return . Uh-huh . No need . She 's ready for you . Sorceress ... report . The source of the light was a girl of 20 annuals . A girl ? Bring her to me . Unfortunately , there were problems . Last time complications , this time problems ? She disappeared into the storm along with her parents . Your storm ? Are you saying they could be here ? Othersiders in the outer zone ? I am sorry , sorceress . You did your best . Zero ... you 've just been promoted . If this girl is in the O.Z .. , find her . Will azkadellia attack from the east ? Who ? The sorceress azkadellia ! The one for whom you spy . From which direction will her men come ? Will they walk , or will they fly ? Okay , how many times do I have to tell you guys that nothing you 've said has made any sense to me ? Perhaps she is just a girl . Yes , I am . I 'm just a girl . Azkadellia has raided most all villages searching for the stone . Are we next on her list ? I don 't know about any list , buy if this is how you treat strangers , I 'm not surprised you have enemies . You know what , can you just please put my locket down ? It has sentimental value . Our scouts spotted these two being pursued by longcoats on the old brick route to central city . Or leading the longcoats there . Somebody saw my parents ? You say parents , I say spies . There 's only one way to know if she speaks truth or lies . Strap her to the flayer , and she talks or dies . Warm up the blades . Squeal as you peel till the truth brings a deal . Hey ! You guys are out of your tiny minds ! What are you doing ? Up here ? Little ankle-biters thought it 'd be funny to keep me hanging around . Loosen that rope , and I might have the last laugh . Come on , doll . If mom and pop really are on the route to central city , then you 're falling further and further behind . You know the way ? Sure . But it 's kind of hard to give directions like this . Unless you have a better offer ... ah ... ooh ... what the hell ? Hey , you ain 't so hot on first glance either , honey . Is-is there a problem ? Hmm ? Oh , um , your , uh ... what ? Your , um ... your zipper 's undone . Oh ... didn 't mean to offend . Got to be careful not to lose your marbles , but , uh , since the sorceress had her medicos take mine ... well , you flick the abacus . Why would they remove your brain ? Because of what I know , or used to know , whatever it was . Name 's Glitch , on account of sometimes my synapses don 't fire right . Sometimes my synapses don 't fire right . You just said that . Did I ? There you go , glitching again . And here I was thinking this nightmare couldn 't get any weirder . This isn 't a nightmare . This is the O.Z .. The outer zone . It used to be a piece of heaven , too . Until azka-d got her claws into it . Longcoats ! What are you doing ? I have an idea ! Hello ? DG ? It 's ... it 's too high to jump . I - I really don 't think this is a good idea . Come back ! Come back right now . Ah ! Come on , we don 't have much time ! Wait for me . DG ... come on ! Quickly , before they see us . Shh ! Hurry . Oh , look , there 's a rope ! You sure you know the way to central city ? The Shinning City in the hill Sure ! The Shinning City in the hill Sure ! My noggin wasn 't always this way , you know . In my heyday , I was government advisor and numero one . I was the top dog 's ... right hand man . It would have all been fine , but her ... the road is around here somewhere . I - l-I know it . Help ! Help ! You look familiar . Have we met before - shh ! Did you hear that ? Yeah ... no . No , no ! No ! No ! No ! Those guys are everywhere . Yeah , that 's life in the O.Z .. These days . Tough and tougher . Not my boy , leave him alone ! Leave him ! No ! Oh ... but even with half a brain , I can tell that we 've got to get out of here . Oh , cripes . Stop it ! Hey ! DG , this isn 't your fight . Leave them alone ! What just happened ? What is it ? A t . D. E. S. P. H. T. L. A tri-dimensional energy-stored projected holographic time loop . Nifty little thing . Hey , I think I invented it . So , it was all fake ? No . I - it happened , sometime or another . Why would they have it playing over and over again if there was no one here to watch it ? Well , I think it ... there 's someone in there . Or something . Whoa . Are you okay ? Where are they ? I 'm going to kill him . So he just had to stand there and watch while his family got tortured over and over again ? The most imaginative tortures are saved for those who resist azkadellia . How long were you trapped in there ? Since that was a sapling . Much obliged for the help . You 're welcome , mr . Cain . I 'm DG , by the way , and this is - I know , a headcase . I have a proper name , you know . And when I remember it , I 'll tell you . What 's a headcase ? It 's what the state does to re-educate criminals . They rip out their brains , make them prisoners of their own minds . Ain 't that right , convict ? Hey , whoa . I ain 't no convict , and just in case I am , it-it was a bogus charge , a frame-job , I 'm sure of it . Yeah , well , I 'll see you down the road . Oh , actually , a road is what we 're looking for . We 're looking for the brick route - - brick route . That leads to a place called central city - - central city . Do you know of it ? Yeah . It 's where Zero was headed after ... that 's where I 'm headed now . Great ! We 'll go with you . I got business . Besides , I don 't travel with kids or convicts . Um , I 'm not a kid , and the people who came to your home came to mine . I 'm just looking for my parents . And I 'm looking for my brain . And maybe we can to help you find - maybe you can what ? My wife ? My boy ? They 're gone . Probably just like your folks are . Look , nothing personal , kid , but look at you . First sign of trouble , you 're just going to cut and run . Nothing personal , but when we found you , you were in a tin box . You don 't know me . Come on , Glitch , we 'll find the way ourselves . The way ? The way leads through the fields of the pa-pay . Pa-pay ? What ? I 've been tossed into a storm , trussed up by lawn gnomes , chased by madmen on horseback , how bad can pa-pays be ? I seen them gnaw people in half inside 30 seconds . Zipperhead , keep your mouth shut . Kid , you stay behind me . Why the sudden change of heart ? Believe me , heart 's got nothing to do with it . Psst ! It came from a young woman . The othersider . Do you know who she is ? I will . ! What 's that ? What 's what ? Ah ! Don 't touch that ! That 's a predigestive enzyme the pa-pay runners use to tenderize their meat . Come on , let 's go . There 's someone in there . An advance hunter party must have snared it . We better get out of here before their friends come back . We can 't just leave him here . You snatch a dinner from a runner , you best be prepared to become its replacement . Let it be . Oh , the poor thing must be scared to death . All right , come on . Let 's go . Hey , can I borrow your razor ? You want that bad attitude dripping out of your ears ? Run ! Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go , DG ! Wrong turn . Go ! The fall might kill us ! Well , they definitely will ! Okay , on the count of three . One ... three ! She searches through the east . Looking for what ? Love . For those she loves . We need to go DG ! The longcoats are after you . DG ? Get a shovel . You lied to me . She 's alive . How could you do such a terrible thing ? Well , it won 't work , you know . She 's still a child . She 's here , isn 't she ? In the O.Z. ? Tripping over her pigtails as she wanders in circles . Oh , thank the stars . What else do you have planned ? Hmm ? Nothing , I ... there is no plan . My prison is obviously a little too comfortable for you . I 'll send out my best spies . No . I 'll send out mine . Hey , you want to come closer to the fire ? Warm up ? Should have left me to die . Oh , great , a basket case . Stay right there . It 's okay . We 're all friends here . You are sad . Miss your mother , and father . They miss you . My name 's DG . What 's yours ? Raw ... well , it 's certainly to the point . You 're injured . He 's a viewer . Viewers are like psychics , but instead of seeing with their minds , they see with their hearts . Azka-d abducts his kind , gets her alchemists to suck the second sight right out of their heads . He could be a big help . Look , I don 't know where you came from , but if you have any interest in staying alive in the O.Z .. , you better get one fact straight real fast . Trust no one . Let 's hope those runners don 't have fang pox . Heal wound . Soothe . What are you doing ? Hey , wait , wait , wait - ah ! Brave man . Good man . Tin man . Oh , I might have known you were a tin man what with that attitude . What 's a tin man ? It 's what they call policemen in central city . At least I think it is . You 're a cop ? Was . Until Zero found out I was part of the resistance . You saw the rest . Thanks . I picked up your parents trail to the west . Good work , my xora . I knew my oldest friend would never fail me . You called for me ? She 's near the fields of the pa-pay . Hey , how about a pitstop , Cain ? No time . Oh , come on , tin man , have a heart . I 'm a thinker , not a hiker . Yeah , we could all use a rest . Don 't forget , all of life 's answers - are found along the old road , I remember . " All of life 's answers are found along the old road . " Did you just say " old road " ? That 's what the locals call the brick road . I thought you said you 'd never been here before . I haven 't been here before but I know this place . The spinner in Milltown was never as complicated as this . No matter where we find ourselves , home is where your heart is . All my dad 's stories ... my parents were from here . What happened here ? Milltown 's been erased . Azkadellia 's term for cleansing history . Uh-oh . We shouldn 't be here . No humans allowed . DG ! What ? Oh , hey , guys . Uh , we were just passing through . We were just passing through ... we were just passing through - stoke the pyre ! Yeah ! Pyre ? Azkadellia 's invaders must be made an example of ! What ? This is ridiculous . I don 't even know this azkadellia person . You who spoke , what is your name ? DG . Your voice patterns are familiar . I 've never been here before . Hey , don 't let him confuse you , baby girl - dad ! He 's just a crazy old cyborg . Oh , I was scared I 'd never see you again . How 's your leg ? Everything 's okay now you 're here . I can 't believe that this is your home . Not just ours . You know how you felt like you never fit in on the other side ? What do you mean ? Well , that voice father vue recalled ... um ... was your mother 's . It 's your voice ? Not mine . Your real mother 's . We are series 1487 ... nurture units . Um , nurture units ? We were programmed with specific protocols to love and protect you like you were our own . Okay , that 's weird . Um ... you 're robots ? Oh , my life is a lie ! It wasn 't a lie to us . We ... we feel like your parents , DG . We love you , but our deeper purpose was to tell you the stories of our world , stories that would prepare you for your return . My return ? When you started having the dreams , we knew it was time for you to come back to the zone , but the longcoats came before we could explain . I 'm from here ? Our final task was to bring you to father vue . He can tell you how to find your real mother . 15 annuals past , Milltown was the jewel of the O.Z .. During that time , a beautiful woman in a dark cloak came to me , her spirit full of dread . She 'd just lost her husband , feared losing her child , too . A girl child she called DG . That 's the woman from my dreams , the one with the lavender eyes . That 's ... that 's my mother ? She was so weak and frightened , I 'm not sure how she found the strength to go on . So afraid that she 'd be discovered , that we 'd be discovered . Doing what ? Saving you . By trusting you to us . Upon your return , your mother tasked me to give you something . She wants it to guide you on your journey . Let it connect you to the light . Ec cot you to her . Longcoats are coming . We 're running out of time . Where can I find my mother ? I know not . But there is a man in the central city who has all the answers . He 's smart , magical , powerful . Some even say he 's a wizard . The mystic man . Yes . You know him ? I worked his protection detail for a time . He 's a good man . Come on . But ... wait ! Please come with us . We can 't , honey , our place is here . You have to go . We are so proud of you . I love you both . I 'm sorry , kid , we got to go . Bye ! Quickly , this way . How much does she know ? It doesn 't have to be like this for either of you , you know . I mean , we could all be friends . How ? Big changes are planned ? You could play an important part in the future of the O.Z .. , or you could be a verse in a song . It 's your choice . Come on , come on ! There it is . Shining city on the hill is starting to tarnish . This isn 't going nearly as well as I thought it would . Looking for resistors . This is a nightmare . We 're going to need some help . Central city people gather round ! Antoine demilo is back in town ! I don 't believe it . Gratification collected from near and far will be available , at reasonable rates , inside the gate in the sin district square . Hey , you , with the stupid hat ! Move it , will ya ? I got commerce to commence here . Wyatt freakin ' Cain . I thought they were pissing ' on your grave . I see you 're moving up in the world . How the sleaze business , demilo ? Well , since you been gone , biz is booming , so , you know , if you don 't mind , I 'm working here , a 'ight ? So am I. Hey , you 're not sportin ' tin no more , so leave go me before I call the nice longcoats over there and request that they bloody your personage ! Ah ! Who needs tin when you have a picture of a certain little man playing bedsheet bingo with Zero 's first wife ? What ? Come on , Cain . Me and mrs . Z , we-we was just joking around . Oh , really ? Why don 't I go ask Zero , see if he thinks it 's funny . Whoa ! Please , have a heart . The guy will flay me like a munchkin ! He won 't have to if you get us inside , and tell me where I can find Zero . What are you gunning for Zero for ? That 's a short hop to a deep grave . You don 't know the half of it . Are you going to help us ? No . Really ? Yeah . Okay . Okay . Tonight 's his weekly shack-up . Ah ! Ooh . Ah . Oh ... that was easy , wasn 't it ? Oh , god , I hate tin men , especially ex-tinmen . Get your mutts in the wagon . City people , gather round ! Antoine demilo is back in town ... good driving , ma . Okay , we 're in . Okay , where can we find the mystic man ? Excuse me , is there a sign on my back , " central city taxi tourist information ? " Oh ! Ow ! Okay , all right . All right . So the mystic man . That 's who you come here for ? Is he still in central city ? Oh , he 's here all right . He 's just not holding court where he used to . Ah ! Ooh ! These 'll get you front row seats . All right ? You can 't go dressed like that , cupcake . Maybe my girls can find you something . You 'll find her something . Ah ! Now , look , the mystic man will have your answers . You don 't need me anymore . Don 't go after Zero . You 're not a killer , you 're a tin man . I told you I 'd get you here , and I did . You take care of yourself , kid . So these are the precious parents ? Where 's your darling girl ? You ran the coercion virus on their cpu 's ? They told us everything , and don 't even remember . Apparently , the girl went to retrieve a message held by the mystic man . My gods , the little bitch has gone to see the wizard . # he 's the man # # the mystic man # # he 'll answer your questions # # he always can # # his wisdom is known throughout the land # I guess old mystic man 's a patron of the , uh ... theatrical arts . # if you 've got a problem he 's got the plan # # the mystic man the mystic man ... # # the mystic , the mystic the mystic man ... # silence ! It is time for the great and terrible mystic man . Question . Mystic man , answer me this , what is the meaning of life ? The answer to that question is as timeless as the moons . We must serve the forces of the universe ... with all our humanity ... and all our humility . First , we must inhale ... the magic . If he 's the man with all the answers , what 's wrong with him ? And hold it ! He 's out of his mind , literally . Hold it ... and you know the meaning of life ! Inhale the magic ? Azkadellia 's vapors . A magic mist that contains a spell of bliss . He doesn 't know if he 's up or down . I 'm sorry , DG . Hi . How you doin ' ? Wait . You know what I like ... well , I know what you like , so just relax , and I 'll make all your dreams come true . Where 's Zero ? Got to go . You just missed him . He busted out of here pronto , something about some girl being smuggled into the city . Cover the back . Lock this place down . They don 't leave . Check upstairs . Seen her ? No ? Hey , there 's that guy who locked up Cain . We go now . We 've got to get out of here . No , I 'm not leaving until I get my answers . Have you seen this girl ? Come in . Come in ! Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . Hi . Yes , come in , yes . Can I , uh ... can I ask you a question ? Yeah , she 's down at the end of the hall . Room number 2 . Shh ... find Zero . Drop it , or I 'll blow you into next week . I thought you weren 't a tin man anymore . We got to go . We can 't . He 's not well . Who 's not well ? Oh my ... that 's not the mystic man I remember . Azkadellia 's really messed him up . She 's got him on the vapors . Hey ... look , until this wears off , you 're going to have to hurt for a while , okay ? I need answers now . It 'd be vapors talking , not him . Do you think Zero 's going to wait ? Sir ? Sir , sir ... you have some answers ... answers ? Yes . Sure . Many years ago , you helped a woman smuggle a child out of the O.Z .. Yes , yes . He O.Z .. Yes . Out of the O.Z .. Yes ! Yes . I was that child . Right . So you have to help me find out where my mother is , who my mother is . Um ... woman , uh , um ... women are great . No , uh ... I remember , um ... I remember who-who , um ... who ... my mother . Who ? My mother . Whose mother ? My mother - whose mother - oh ! I 'm sorry . You have most brilliant beautiful blue eyes , but your mother ... you mother had lavender . You do remember . Okay , kiddo , we got to get out of here right now . Not now , mr . Cain . He hasn 't told us where to find my mother . Cain ? Cain , you were one of mine , weren 't you ? A tin man . A long time ago . I 'll talk to you later . Psst ! Psst ! Please ... the northern island . The northern island . Your journey for her , to find who you are , starts there . Let this guide you . Okay . All right , you two , get those two out of here . Let 's go , let 's go . No , no , no . No , you stay with her at all costs . I have to take care of Zero . You know who she now . She 's the key . Promise me . I want your word as a tin man you will not leave her side at any cost . You have my word . Wakey wakey , sunshine . Go away , we 're closed . Ow ! I said back off , moron . Class act , demilo . Cain , what do you want ? Thanks for the ride . How can you do this to me ? I have a wife and children . This is my wagon ! How do you start this thing ? Oh , you go to pull the knob out , then twist the red thing . Thank you . This is my wagon ! Cain ! Cain , I 'm talking to you ! Cain , I ... that 's my wagon ! If it isn 't the great and terrible blah , blah , blah himself . What are you up to , old man ? Huh ? A little scent . A little whiff . Oh , you don 't fool me . Please ? Please . Please . Why did she come to see you ? What did you give her ? Hook him up . What was that ? I don 't know . You all right ? Yeah , just freezing . You stay here . Oh , what now ? Broke axle . No kidding . Come on , let 's go . We 're walking . What we 're looking for is over there . Ice mountain ? That 's the northern island ? Well , I know it 's around here somewhere . " Frozen in time in a sea of ice , " just like my dad said it would be . The microcosm is expanded by a single bead of sweat dropped on a pinhead and spun into a million universes until it is converted into the elixir of the gods ... he 's masking . Lylo see too much ! ... and can longing , great and passionate longing reach fulfillment . Lylo see too much ! My fingers , extended to the stars ... focus , Lylo , don 't let him sway you . ... becomes merely a flicker in the light of the storm , a glimpse of heaven , fierce and beautiful and unfiltered - pain ... where is she ? So much pain . Move beyond the pain . The northern island . She 's going to see mommy . Dig . Dig ? What do you mean , dig ? Wait , wait . " The daughter of light " came upon " a glistening white mountain " frozen in time in a sea of ice . " Above all else she knew that ... " that this mountain " was more than it appeared . It was home . " Is it locked ? My mother was the queen ? That makes you princess . You knew my mother . I knew I wasn 't an idiot , or a convict . I was the queen 's advisor . " The queen sat ... " gazing hopefully out upon her frozen realm ... " longing for her daughter to return . " DG , wait . Sad ... mother waited . Couldn 't stay . There is something so familiar about this . No . Bad things ... bad things happened here . What bad things ? We go . We go now . No . No , I need to know . Raw , please . Bad things ... # two little princesses dancing in a row # # spinning fast and freely on their little toes # # where the light will take you there 's only one way to know # # two little princesses dancing in a row ... # my angel , my light . Sleep well . Wait , that 's you . I knew you , too . Oh , I wish I could remember . " The majestic queen of the O.Z .. Had two lovely daughters she ... " that 's azkadellia . Marbles or not , evil like that you don 't forget . Azkadellia 's my sister . " One to darkness " she be drawn , " and one to light she be shown . " Double eclipse it is foreseen , " light meets dark in the stillness between , " but only one , " and one alone , " shall hold the emerald and take the throne . " Only one , and one alone . She tried to kill me . No . She did kill you . But that can 't be . I 'm so sorry I didn 't protect you . I never thought ... oh , my angel . Fear not , my child , there is one thing that can stop her . The emerald of the eclipse . The secret to finding it now lives inside of you . When the time is right , you will return . Mother never could leave well enough alone . Azkadellia . You 're my sister . DG ... the little sister I thought I no longer had . I 've always wondered what you 'd look like . Leave her alone . What do you want ? Well , up until a moment ago , I wanted your death , but now it seems you have something I need . What ? The emerald . You know where it is . Don 't tell me you haven 't dreamed of it , heard it calling to you begging to be found from its dark hiding place . No , I haven 't . No ? No . What did she whisper in your ear ? I don 't remember . That 's a shame . How can I tell you what I don 't know ? DG , where are you ? Mother ? DG , where are you ? What have you done with her ? Put her away for safe-keeping . Like any good daughter would . Where ? Somewhere you will never find her . Go ! Go ! Wait ! Bring her to me . Now I know why they call you Zero . Still can 't fight your own battles . I do my share . DG ! Bring him . Put me down ! No iron suit for you this time . No wife and child crying for years to free you from it . My family 's alive ? Hardly matters now . Glitch ! Ah ! Welcome back , little sister . There 's no place like the O.Z .. Episode 2 [ Search For The Emerald ] Mother ? I missed you . I don 't even know you . Your light is strong . Let it guide you through your memories . I 'm a waitress , and a part-time student . I don 't think I can do this . I 'm scared . When you were a girl , I used to rock you at our special place . Remember . Dg , breakfast ! Wind last night made a real mess a things . Branches took out a transformer . Well , you better fix it before it fixes us . Come on , woman , I can 't work on an empty tank . Besides , I need our expert on this one , if she ever wakes up . Morning , sleepyhead . All right ... Was I asleep ? Dead to the world for 14 hours . Figured you must 've had something on your mind . Lord knows I have . I was wrong , dg . You have a right to your own life . I had no business looking through your stuff last night . That was last night ? Had that crazy nightmare again , huh ? In technicolor . Well , you 're awake now so you better help your dad before he wrecks this place . But , the farm was wrecked . Mercy me . Have you been having those chili cheese fries before bed again ? But your stories must have worked their way into my subconscious , because there was a frozen lake and a palace , and my mother was a queen , and she was trying to get me to remember this thing about an emerald , so I could stop my evil sister . Well , did you ? Remember , I mean ? No , and when I didn 't , she sicked these monkey-bats on me . Well , you got the storm part right , baby girl . We got a heck of mess to clean up . That 's the cold hard reality . Finally talking some sense . Heck with that . You know I 'd pick a good story over work any day . I 'd rather hear the big secret about that emerald the queen whispered into your ear . Aw , popsicle , I can 't remember . It was something ... What something , honey ? I never said she whispered anything into my ear . Sorry , baby girl , guess I blew it . It 's okay , popsicle . I know you tried your best . That was all fake ? You are twisted . Why ? Because with a little re-wiring , I 've gotten something I 've missed out on for too long ? A father 's love , a mother 's affection . Where are my real parents . Our parents ? Well , daddy , the thief , abandoned us after you ... Died . Mother never forgave him for that . Had his name officially banished from the lands . Ever the drama queen . Where is she ? There came a time when she had to be ... Isolated . Mother ? Dg , where are you ? Let her go . That can be arranged , but first you have to do something for me . Fear not , my child , there is one thing that can stop her . The emerald of the eclipse . The secret to finding it now lives inside of you . When the time is right , you will return . Dg , just ... Tell me where the emerald is . Just tell me what she whispered to you , and I will take you to her . I promise . I don 't remember . That was a long time ago . We can pry those memories out of her . Zero , she 's my sister . I guess I haven 't really made this much of a family reunion , have I ? Well , I wasn 't expecting a picnic . I want to show you something , share something with you . " the majestic queen of the O.Z. had two lovely daughters , she . " " double eclipse it is foreseen , light meets dark in the stillness between , " " but only one and one alone , shall hold the emerald and take the throne . " So , what is that ? The great and ominous prophecy of the O.Z. It 's a nursery rhyme . A few couplets that roll pleasingly off the tongue . It 's not who we are , dg . You tried to kill me . I was just a child you know , I ... I foolishly believed the part about " only one and one alone . " and you don 't now ? No . I believe that the prophecy can be what you and I make of it . Dg , we were such good friends . We spent hours imaging what the O.Z. Would be like when we grew up . Please , you must remember that . We were friends ? We 'd explore the woods , gather apples , skip little stones across the lake . We made mother crazy with worry . Apples ? No . I 'm not buying what you 're doing with this whole " keys to the kingdom " crap . I 'm not doing anything . I just want what the prophecy can bring to both of us . It 's our birthright . It 's our chance to make a new O.Z. Just tell me where it is . I don 't remember . Dg ... My lovely little sister . That was the wrong ... Answer . Now we do it your way . I 'll take her for a reading with lylo . If you remember nothing else , remember this . The next time I snuff out your insignificant little life , there 'll be no one standing by to save you . Raw ? Cain ... Now it 's dinner for three . Lylo ... No ! He 's not one of us anymore . No iron suit for you this time . No wife and child crying for years to free you from it . My family 's alive ? My family 's alive ? My family 's alive ? You been sleeping for hours like a ... Like a baby with his pacifier . I thought you were dead . Ditto . You know , I may have saved you from hypothermia , but ... This is what saved your life . It stopped the bullet . Dg ... Azkadellia . Raw ? I don 't know , I can 't find him . Either they took him , too , or ... - He 's dead , or- - - maybe he ran away . You know , you really should do something about that bitter cynicism of yours , cain . Why ? Someone 's got to keep your wide-eyed optimism in check . Hey , glitch ... What ? I owe you one . You know , cain , professional psychiatric therapy is only a crow 's call away these days . I think a man like you with your issues of masculinity , and the ... Well , we call it the " boy scout syndrome ... " no ... Leave him alone ! No ... No ! No ... No ! Stop ! Stop ! A whisper , lylo . All I 'm looking for is a secret whispered to a little girl ! Lylo can 't find . - Focus ! - Something protecting her memories ! Break through . Now ! Lylo is trying ! Don 't try ! Do ! How can he remember , if I can 't ? What did mother whisper into dg 's ear about the emerald ? Emerald ... Only thing can stop Azkadellia . Focus , lylo ! Where is it ? All is gray ! Emerald within the gray gale . Gray gale ? What is the gray gale ? Don 't know . Can 't see . Where is it ? Hurts to reach into her memories . Memories surrounded by ... Magic . Lylo ! Magic ? I don 't have to guess who 's responsible for that , do I ? Mother ... More secrets ? You 've cloaked dg 's memories with your magic . You 're the one who forced secrets into our lives . Well , you did your work a little too well . All traces of the gray gale are gone . She 'll never remember now . Are you surprised I know about the gray gale ? What do you know ? Learn to love me , mother . Learn to trust me , and I will give you back your throne . Put the crown upon your head , and kneel at your feet . The loyal daughter you always dreamed of . You 're not my daughter . You 're ... How could you say such a thing ? - You made me who I am . - No . Tell me where the emerald is . Not while there 's still a breath in my body . Raw sorry ... Raw run away . Raw scared . We all scared . Don 't let them do this to kalm . He needs us . Needs you . Sleep . This one will read the girl next . Take him to the gilded hall for initialization . No ! Oh , please ... Try again . Lylo ... Lylo ? Raw ? What are you looking at ? I have a theory which can 't be unproven . Mystic man ? You 're alive ! It is called ... The " or not " theory . Oh , I have so much to tell you . Ah , ah , ah ... You know that they wouldn 't put you in a cell near mine unless they wanted to hear us talk . She 's . She 's listening ? First , you must journey to the north , or not . Yes , I journeyed to the north . I went to the ice palace , and I know who my mother is . Are you sure you 're not still on the vapors ? I 've never been clearer in my whole life . It 's all coming back to me . My troubled childhood , a rich life of scholarly pursuit , my brief but glamorous life in show business , although that part is a little bit hazy . Did you feel that ? Yeah . They 're testing a machine . What sort of machine ? The complete destruction of the O.Z. Is that why she needs the emerald ? O ... Kay . What are we going to do ? There is so much I would like to tell you , but . Azkadellia 's eyes and ears are all over us now . Okay . Tell me what you know about the ... The gray gale is a myth ... Dreamt up by the ancients to entertain their children . Time to change tack . Long time no see . Azkadellia ? A little older , a lot smarter , and most definitely still in charge . Nothing like a violent coup to win the hearts and minds of a kingdom . Good . You still have a memory . It may be the one thing that can save you . What do you want ? What I want is the very thing you 've devoted your feeble life to . Magic , my friend . Those who can 't do , teach . Remember ? Your freedom for your help . My help ? I mean , I 'm not saying they called me twinkle toes , or anything , but I cut quite a rug . Oh , you can make a face , cain , but it 's true . There was a time when I was a fantastic dancer . She may have taken my brains , but rhythm ! That comes directly from your- - do you have any bright ideas how to get in there ? I mean , I don 't mind taxing my half brain for dg , but just once I wish that someone would acknowledge me for my rhythm , which as I was trying to say before I was so rudely interrupted , comes directly from the soul . Sometimes , cain , you make me feel just like those ladies at the dance did , like i blend right into the wallpaper . That 's a good idea . You want to dance ? I 'll lead , you follow . What i can tell you is that your mother cloaked your memories in magic , so that Azkadellia cannot get to them . Great . The only thing is , neither can I. Yes , you can . You know what , my mother was really good with the " to-do " list , she just wasn 't so good with the " how-to-do " lists . She said you must unlock your memories . Your light must brighten a place that is dark . In the south . It 's where you 'll find a message about your future and your past . Fiery , aren 't they ? Never seen ' em that large . Left , left ! Left , right , left ! Left , left ! Left , right , left ! You 're a deep well , glitch . It 's all about rhythm . Come on , let 's go . So eager to please the wrong sister . Azkadellia ... As I live and breathe . So far . I don 't know which is more pathetic , you on the vapors or off . Your sister is more powerful than you . She will never ... be as powerful as me . Then why are you so scared ? I know you ... Witch . What do you know ? Stop , az ! Stop it ! Unlock your memories . Not so great and terrible after all , huh ? Hey ! Do I know you ? Hey ... Thanks . My friend 's this way . Dg ? Dg ! Raw ! Are you okay ? Let 's get you out of here . longcoats . That could bust a zipper . Glitch ... Hey there , princess . Cain , you 're alive ! Barely . Furry lips here really packs a punch . We 've got to get out of here . Well , we can 't get out the way we came in . This way . Come on . Dg ! Which way ? Which way ? You 're taking directions from a dog . Left or left ? I 've got them , sir ! Longcoats ! I think he wants us to go in there . I think we 'd better hurry . Let 's go . You 're a good boy ! You knew the way ! It 's okay . It 's okay , I 'm a friend , I 'm a friend of your mother 's . She sent me to help . We 'd better go . We 've got an emerald to find . Good , good . Are you ready , kid ? Yeah . That machine that we escaped through ? The mystic man said that she was going to use that to destroy the O.Z. Wait a second . You saw the mystic man ? He 's dead . She killed him . He said that she needs the emerald to make the machine work . That 's interesting . How ? Folks ... I suggest we keep moving . Sorry , pooch , but this is where we part company . Part ? With the longcoats on our trail and the mobats in the sky , I don 't have time to figure out what your angle is in all of this . My angle is her mother sent me to help . And you did . I 'd even thank you for what you did back there if I knew who you were , or what . Whoa . Mr.Suspicious , this is the man ... Dog ... Thingie ... Who helped us escape ! - Shape-shifter . - Yes . Yes , Mr.Raw. He knew your name . How did you know his name ? I know all of your names . You 're Mr.Glitch , former advisor to the queen herself , Mr.Raw , a viewer of extraordinary skill , and you , Mr.Cain you were a tin man on the mystic man 's protection detail . You 're all quite famous in the O.Z. And quite in demand . Dead or alive . That is a terrible picture of me . Mmm ... Now , look , I 'm sorry if I scared any of you back there , but there 's never really a great time for the old beast-into-man moment . You just ... Wham ! And hope for the best . I don 't know . You 're still a stranger . Am I ? Let 's just see about that . Hey , that 's mine . It was yours when you were a child . Whoa . Am I really doing this ? Indeed you are . Magic 's in your blood . Let it shed light on your past so that you may better face your future . Now , concentrate , dg . Concentrate . Concentrate , dg . You must let the light flow through you effortlessly . Remember , light as air . To ... It 's tutor . Now , focus . I am , but this thing won 't float ! It will . It wants to . Just concentrate , deeg . Yes ! Yes ! Tutor . You were our tutor . Before you were sent over to the other side , your mother put a spell on all of your memories , in case you were ever taken into the wrong hands . So I 've been told . Well , she sent me now to help you reawaken the memories you 'll need to find the gray gale , and the emerald of the eclipse . Wait , how did you see her if she 's in azkadellia 's prison ? She came to me in a dream , but she 's growing weaker and weaker . There 's no time to waste . Mystic man said to head south . Then that 's exactly what we should do . Don 't you think , cain ? South ? Yes , that 's-that 's what I meant . Excuse me . South . Unfortunately , the only road to the south leads through the fields of p-pay . P-Pay ... - I should kill you ! - Shh ! She 's in conference . And I will . I will ... My men just told me that wyatt cain is alive . He was here . If she finds out . Finds out what ? That you 're utterly incapable of putting one man in his grave ? I shot him out a window into a freezing lake . That man has nine lives . He 's not the only one . Xora ... That 's my girl . She 's heading south . My men will blitz the area immediately . No , they won 't . You have them dead to rights , and you don 't want to take her ? No . I want her to lead me straight to the emerald . You 've planted a spy . Just keeping an eye on her , as any concerned big sister would . I want you to shadow her . Don 't get too close . Think you can handle a little restraint , zero ? That can 't be good . Hunter parties are out . Stay sharp . Did it always look so dead ? No , this used to be some of the most fertile land in the O.Z. So , what happened ? Well , about 15 annuals ago , all the crops died , which then caused a great famine . I bet I can guess who 's responsible . Yeah . You 'd think somebody would 've helped them with their crops , maybe ... Engineered a doohickey with a couple ... Thingies ... Got to love a good orchard . Papay once peaceful . Yeah ? Well , now the only peace they 're interested in is a piece of us ! Were farmers . Now hunters . No wonder they 're desperate . - They don 't have any food- - - shh , shh ! Runner scouts . They 're signaling to the others . Run ! Ah ! Good boys . Good boys . Com it 's almost dinner-time . Dg ... Use your gift . To do what ? Focus , dg . You 've got it in you . I don 't know how . Just focus . It isn 't working . Why are they bowing ? Thanking us . That is one heck of a defense , kid . Good , dg . Let 's get out of here . Come on.Easy ... Thank you . Let 's go , let 's go . Dg , my darling . You 're shaking like a leaf . What 's wrong ? She fell , and I let go . Oh , what are you talking about ? There 's az right there . You okay ? Yeah . It looked like you were having a nightmare , a bad one . Dg dream of azkadellia . Yeah . She told me once that we were friends when we were little , and I didn 't believe her , but now I 'm not so sure . Maybe your dream 's trying to tell you something . In my dream , I 'm scared , and my mother is rocking me on a swing ... In a special place . A beautiful place by a lake . Well , there 's about a hundred lakes just south of here . - Dg know which lake . - No , I don 't . You u do , dg . Because you were there before , as a little girl . Try . What was it like ? It was ... magical . To get to lake country , we have to cut across the crack in the O.Z. This ain 't going to be easy . I brought you a gift . Bulgar novi . Once extinct in the fields of the papay . I thought I 'd never enjoy their fragrance again . I suppose some things thought dead aren 't always so . Save the poetry for someone who cares . What do you want ? The little witch is reconnecting with her past . Then hope lives . And what about you , Azkadellia ? Perhaps dg isn 't the only one who needs to unlock her memories . I 'm only concerned with the future . Then why are you here talking to me ? Why have you locked me away for all these years , kept my hope alive ? To see your face the day that hope dies . Can 't we rest ? I 'm tired . No time . We have to get to finaqua . I 'd give my last synapse for a juicy apple . - Apples ... - What is it ? Something Azkadellia said . We 'd explore the woods , gather apples ... Clever how you tricked that old tree to throw fruit at us . I heard tell of it once in a story from the past . We should get back before mother realizes we 're gone , or we 'll be history , too . We are not supposed to be out here alone . She says there 's wild animals in the forest . Did you say what kind of wild animals ? Lions , and tigers , and ... Oh my ! Just hold my hand , deeg ! Nothing can hurt us if we stay together ! Azkadellia , what happened to you ? Hey , kiddo ... Are you coming ? Yeah . They won 't be puttin a zipper on that gaper . Longcoats everywhere . Yeah , we 're not getting past them in broad daylight . The eclipse is almost upon us . We don 't have any time to waste . Look , quick and dead might be okay with you , dogman , but I 'll take slow and breathing any time . Even then , we 're going to need some help . Cabin . Probably full of longcoats . No . Look at the smoke . So they lit a fire . Longcoats get cold , too . It 's blue . Come on . State your business . We mean you no harm . We 're travelers of the realms seeking a warm meal and a cold cup of grog . Food is scarce this time of year , and the grog has long since been seized . Then we will leave you in peace . May your hearth be warm . And your smoke be blue . Come in , quickly . Thank you ... For your help . I 'm that 's my wife , Lorraine . Put your gun on the table . They 're friends , Lorraine . No such thing anymore . It 's okay . We just need shelter till it 's safe to cross . It 's never safe . But the cover of night will help . Until then , sit , rest . Newom the resistance in the east ? Well , I was hoping that you would tell us . Do you know anything about a machine that Azkadellia 's building ? Only rumors . We helped a captain from the lowlands . All he said was that Azkadellia was pushing the miners and the metalworkers till they dropped . What mine ? Some mine in the black mountains . Mauritanium . Big " m " , little " t " . Number 216 in the ozian periodic table . School days . - I remember a lovely lass named Leona who - - Mauritanium . What 's it for ? Besides its strength , mauritanium is valued for its ability to conduct magical energy . So if she gets a hold of the emerald , she can focus the power however she wants . Not if we get to it first . So it 's a weapon . No , it 's a sunseeder . What 's a sunseeder ? I don 't know , but it sounds cool . Oh , wait ... I invented it . What 's it used for ? I can 't remember . I can 't remember . I 'm sorry , we don 't have time for this . We have to know . Raw ? Calibrating the sequencing is a delicate process . Will it work ? It will work perfectly , sorceress . You have planned well , and nothing will stand in your way . | ? I 'm not so sure about all this . Glitch ... If azkadellia 's building a machine that you designed , you might be the key to stopping her . I am talking about fluffy diving into my cranium . Invasion of my privacy and all ... Dark day . Majesty , I bring bad news . The princess Azkadellia has seized central city . Have our men pull back . To the south . What ? The fourth brigade has fallen . General lonot has defected . He was our most loyal friend . I 'm so sorry . There was no law other than Azkadellia 's . She tried to steal the plans for the sunseeder . But I was able to destroy the blueprints . She 'll come after you , Ambrose . Is there nothing you can do , majesty ? Too late . The darkness is too deeply rooted in her . But your light . You are the most powerful being in all of the O.Z. Was , old friend . I gave my power and my light to save someone very special . My angel ... Show some respect . The queen 's reign ends today . Do you have any idea what you are doing ? I do . You need a long rest , mother . Take her away , and take him to the alchemist . If you won 't tell me what you know , I guess I 'll just have to reach in and take it myself . Remove the brain slowly . No ... Please don 't-don 't do this . Please , it won 't-it won 't work . - Please . - Count back from 100 . Please ... Please ! 99 ... Don 't do it.Don 't ... 98 ... 97 ... 96 ... Oh , my ... Uh , the name 's glitch , have we ... Are you okay ? Yes , glitch , I 'm fine . What ? Was my machine so bad ? No . But whatever it is , you sure sacrificed a lot to stop Azkadellia . That 's why she had to go straight to the source . Oh , I guess it wasn 't the biggest sacrifice ever made for science . But it sure is up there . The time to go is now . Full dark and the moons have yet to rise . You okay ? I 'm disappointed in myself . My mother gave up her power to bring me back to life , and that 's how Azkadellia was able to take over . You know , kiddo , there are some things in life that are just ... Out of our control . But we need you . You got to let it go . Come on . - Where did you get this ? - We should go . Where did you get this ? A resistance fighter made it for my son . He came through a few months back with his mother . I think their names were- - jeb ... And adora . My family , they really are alive . You 're a lot like her , you know . She wasn 't always all ermine robes and " thee 's " and " thou 's " . She started out just like you . Feisty but fair . My mother 's done so much for me , and I don 't even know her name . Oh , well , that 's easy . Her name was queen ... It 's okay . But she was happy to make the sacrifices she thought were right . We should all love someone that much . Come on . Quickly . Help me with this . Come on . We hide it as best we can . Good . Get it all . There is not much time . Your family crossed this same line , friend . Said they were headed to an old cabin about three spans on the other side , tucked behind a giant white elm , the only one there . Thank you . - We should thank you . - All right , come on . I 'm too big for that thing . Did I ever tell you I was afraid of heights ? You were hanging from the ceiling when I met you . Involuntarily ! If you shape-shift , I swear I 'll drop you - You okay ? - Yeah . All right , let 's go . There . That 's it . That 's where my family made their new home . I really don 't think there 's time for this . He 's always made time for us . Adora ! Jeb ! Adora ! Jeb They crossed the gorge . Why continue south ? Nothing there but wasteland and ... Finaqua . That 's the first place you searched for the emerald years ago . It seems the light is helping the pure of heart . Zero awaits your orders . Should he ride to finaqua ? No , and tell him not to get too close . Your son , jeb , still lives . No . He lives to honor you . I feel it . You feel too much . Come on , let 's get a move on . You 've sent her into the heart of darkness , mother . Why finaqua ? She needs to know what she 's up against . Which way now ? Well , both ways head south . Your mother said your memories would guide you , dg . Let them . I don 't know , it looks familiar . Well , dig deeper . Remember , dg . I remember ... Her swinging me on a swing , and the suns reflecting in my eyes , and the breeze off the water . Oh , what 's that ? No ! Sorceress ! Water.Water ... Right away . Xora ? What happened ? Little beastie just came out of nowhere . Why did it attack now ? Probably a random hit . It 's dead now . Great . Maybe we should just move along like it never happened . Never happened ? Once az finds out that this one 's missing , she 's going to have longcoats crawling all over the zone looking for it . All the more reason to get moving . You okay ? You 're sweating up a storm . I 'm fine . I know . Come on ! What is this ? - She 's found something . - Come on . This way , come on . Dg ! Where are we ? Dg this way . Dg ? Where is she ? - I just saw her . - Where ? Dg ! Come on , come on . You were right about the magical waters , dg . That 's what " finaqua " means in the ancient 's language . Not sure about the translation now though . This used to be paradise . Not paradise now . It was one of the first places az scorched when she came to power . Well , she sure didn 't leave much . No . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble ... What was that ? Wait , guys , let her find it alone . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take them they will never know ... did you hear that ? Hear what ? Let 's go see what it is . No , we should get back . Mom said to stay close . If we did everything mom said , we 'd never have any fun . Come on , it 's like an adventure . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble . two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take them they will never know two little princesses dancing in a row dancing in a row dancing in a row ... Remember . Help ! Do you hear that ? We should go get mom and dad . Your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble . Hello ! Look at this . It 's the picture language of the ancients . Can you tell what it means ? Some . At the dawn of time , good battled evil , and the light conquered over the darkness , and something about an evil witch ... Well ... That was fun . Wait . What is this place ? It looks ancient . Maybe it 's a tomb . I 'm not sure , but that face creeps me out . Let 's go . Don 't you T ? there 's someone trapped in there . Dg ! What have we done ? Hey , are you okay ? No , wait . How did you get re ? Help me ! Our parents aren 't far . We 'll go and bring back help . No ! I mean ... Please , don 't leave me alone . I 've been waiting ... Calling . I thought this day would never come . The magic is strong in you . Let go . No . - Don 't let go . - But I 'm scared . We have to stay together . You u can let go , little girl . No . T go no ! Dg my darling , you 're shaking like a leaf . What 's wrong ? Az ... She fell , and I let go . What are you talking about ? There 's az right there . Azkadellia , are you all right ? Of course , mother . I 've never felt better . I 'm sorry my sister . All the terrible things that have happened , they were all my fault . I should never have let go . Excuse the interruption , sorceress , but without xora 's reports , zero would like to know if you 'd wish him to pick up the trail . I will pick up the trail myself . Find her . Episode 3 [ Tin Man ] Hey ... You still in that cave ? I just feel so bad that I led her in there . You can 't blame yourself . It 's because of me that the witch got out . Look , you were just a kid . And I ran . You 're not running now , are you ? Your light must brighten a place that is dark . What is it , another memory ? It 's where you 'll find a message about your future and your past . I just need to find my mother 's message . Where ? Here in finaqua . Concentrate , Dg . Flat rocks fly . Round rocks die .

The emerald of the eclipse contains the power to bring either light or darkness to the O. Z. As you now know , the evil witch of the dark lives inside your sister . That is why she knows not of my plan And why I could only entrust the emerald 's power to you , my angel . Make haste now , south to the realm of the unwanted . There you must find a man named Ahamo . He will help you in the final leg of your journey To save the O. Z. To the gray gale , to the emerald . Wait ! Who 's Ahamo ? Ahamo is your father .

You 've just been antsy as a guild fighter since we left finaqua . I 'm ... Just nervous about being a man on the run , I suppose . Yeah , I hear you . The sky 's clear . Yeah . But I get this funny feeling that we 're being followed . What do you think ? Another mobat ? Didn 't you say it was probably just a random scout Who just stumbled across us ? Didn 't you say we should pretend it never happened ? You were sweating then , too . Let go of me ! Let go - I 'd shoot you in the heart if I thought you had one . Cain ... What are those ? Bread crumbs for Azkadellia . She had an inside man all along , didn 't she ? A spy . Tutor ? Your trail ends here . You don 't understand . I stopped dropping those a while back . Afraid you 'd get caught ? But you were family . I still am , Dg . I care more about you than anybody else in the whole wide world . Then why would you do that ? For the last ... 15 annuals , I 've been locked up in a dark hole . Azkadellia came to me . She offered me my freedom if I 'd track you . If I had said no , She would have killed me on the spot . So I figured , At least I could keep her off your back while you rediscover your magic . But if that were the truth , why did you drop those disks ? Why didn 't you let us get away clean ? You know as well as I do that would have never worked . She would have been on us quick as death . Now , look , you guys , Whether you like it or not , Those things bought us valuable time . Why didn 't you tell me sooner ? I swear , Dg , I was just about to . I think it 's time to put this dog down . No . We 're all looking for second chances . Toto , too . Thank you , Dg . It doesn 't mean that I trust you , But we 're almost at the realm , And you 're the only one Well , we can 't just let him walk . Maybe we could keep him on a short leash . That 's a good idea . If you really mean what you say , you won 't mind traveling with us as Tutor . One wrong move , and I 'll take you on a walk you don 't come back from . You hear me ? Yeah . Now that we know that Azkadellia had a spy , She 's a lot closer than we thought we 've got to pick it up a notch . Come on , let 's go . Come on . My mother and father planned all this from the beginning , didn 't they ? They know all about us , don 't they ? They knew , and they left you for dead . I on the other hand , will never leave you . Think ! Ahamo is a man weak of heart , blinded by emotion , nostalgic , sentimental . He was so happy here . That 's it . That 's it . There must be a trace we can follow . Dg 's not the only one who can remember , is she ? Remember . Focus . Dg ? Leave them here . He 'll find them when he comes back with mother . Do you think father will know they 're from us ? Well , he told us to make him something he could keep forever , and he taught us how to sculpt clay . What if they 're touched with our magic ? Good idea . Now he 'll definitely know . Come on . Daddy . You loved that sappy little token of your daughters 'love , didn 't you ? I bet you still have it with you , glowing bright as a beacon . Go find the glow . Find Ahamo . What ? Trust me , the realm of the unwanted is here . Somewhere . I think he 's found something . Come on . I 'm fine . Where 'd he go ? Over there ! Come on . Come on . Yeah . Well , that 's some you don 't see everyday . Careful , Dg , careful . Easy ... Yeah , come on , let 's go . Come on ... Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . Come on , come on . Glitch , come on ! Come on ! Cain , uh , help a zipperhead out with a memory or two . In this realm , who exactly are the unwanted ? Criminals , outlaws , and a few living experiments gone wrong . Oh , and my father 's here ? How odd . Hey , look . What 's he doing now ? - I don 't know . Anybody got any money ? ASK AIROFDAY QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERS UNSPOKEN Can 't say they didn 't welcome us with open arms . Questions are answers unspoken . Isn 't it a little cramped in there ? Reference is to uncomfortable tight spaces . Answer , yes . Isn 't that good ? Okay . We got to go find Ahamo . Answer , Ahamo is a hard man to find . You know him ? More money . Answer , know personally ? No . Okay , great . Thank you for nothing . Goodbye . We were told Ahamo was here in the realm . Reply , know of one who might know this Ahamo . Answer , the seeker . Where can we find the seeker ? And you thought I had trouble with directions . The seeker doesn 't talk to just anybody . Doesn 't like strangers . He 'll like us . Where is he ? I might be able to arrange a meeting . Really ? What 's the catch ? 20 platinums . 20 platinum 's ? Done . Where is this meeting place ? Local tavern at the edge of the realm . Meet there at the rising of the first moon after midnight . We 'll be there . Airofday . Seeker . They are looking for Ahamo . They asked for him by name ? Yes . I 've been seeking Ahamo many years . He holds valuable secrets . You can ask them all the questions you want before we turn them in . I am offering you my usual split for your help . Are you in ? I am , But we do it my way , just the two of us . Oh , daddy ... I don 't like the looks of this place . Why don 't you guys wait outside ? I 'll cut the deal myself . No , I think we should ... Stick together . I feel very safe with you guys . Really ? I don 't . You , sit and stay . There 's nothing to be afraid of . Where can we find the seeker ? I 'm here . We were told that you knew where to find Ahamo . Show me your palm . What for ? Do you want my help or not ? It 's okay . The other one . Now ! We had a deal ! Put me down ! I can 't see ! Get us out of here ! - Dg Dg ... WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE Yeah , that 's right , abuse the guy with the zipperhead . It amazes me that you once influenced the queen . I know . Me too . But she wouldn 't be very proud of me right now , Though , being empty-headed enough to let her daughter walk right into a trap . Yeah , you and me both . Look ! Toto ! Hey , toto , come on , show these longcoats what you 're really made of . He just did . I believe you owe me something . A slow death or a quick one . Didn 't I capture three of the most wanted men in the zone ? What you did was stick your six greedy little hands into something far bigger than a bounty . Get rid of her . What ? No . No , zero , don 't do this . Give me my money . Zero ! Word from the Sorceress . We should return to the tower . At least I 'll have a souvenir to remember you by . Why don 't you unshackle me . I 'll teach you how to use it . You surprise me , cain . Not a lot of men make it out of the iron suit with their sense of humor intact . Let 's see how funny you are when you 're ... Hanging from the gallows in central city square . Let 's go ! Going somewhere ? What have you done with my friends ? Well , last I saw of them , they were putting up a good fight . Oh , so you only get a quarter of the bounty . I didn 't take you for the money . Oh ... Where I come from , freaks like you drive vans . Dg , you don 't understand , So just calm yourself . Calm myself ? I 'm not a kidnapper . Okay , so take me to my friends , seeker . I only call myself " seeker " so others in the realm Will come to me when they want to find Ahamo . What ? It was your mother 's idea . What do you know about my mother ? Well , I know you look just like her . You got your passion and your grit from her ... Your artistic ability from me . You 're my father ? Yes , Dg . The one your mother calls Ahamo . I have been dreaming of this day , of seeing you again . Okay , so you 've seen me , so ... Give me whatever it is my mother sent me for , And I 'll be leaving your , uh , teepee . Like it or not , Dg , I 'm your father . No , no , I had a real father . He was a robot , but he was there for me . He was a good guy . That 's for kidnapping me ! And that 's for abandoning my mother ! And that 's for being a complete bastard ! Stop , Dg ! Stop ! Everything you think you know , you don 't . Now , let me explain - - explain what ? Oh , you 're a pistol , I 'll mive yo that much . Just like your mother . Just as lovely , too . Don 't play that fake lovey-dovey card with me . I don 't buy it for one second . My feelings as real as they get , Dg . Go on , it 's from your mother . It 's from my mother ? What is it ? It 'll lead you o the gray gale . And the emerald . Dg ... I know this is a lot for you to handle right now . All I ask is that you open your heart . Trust me . Can you ? We have a long way to go and not much time . But I can 't go anywhere without my friends . Dg , the eclipse is almost here , and you 're the O. Z. ' s only hope , Now , your friends understand how important this mission is . Help me turn it over . Get this out of our way . Sorry . Now ! Would you and your troops like a drink of water ? Father ... Son . It just keeps spinning . Maybe you 're just trying too hard . Clear your mind . Remember how it felt when you were a little girl , How the light flowed through you . Just concentrate , Deeg . Hey , did you see that ? Hey ... Hurry . Here , let me help you . Help me lift him off the cart . Grab the other side . Fetch some bandages . On three ... This way . Move ! What 's that doing here ? I keep it to remind me . To remind everyone . What we 're fighting for . You know , i , uh ... I thought you were dead . They told mother and I you were dead . If I knew you were still alive , I would have risked everything , Crossed enemy lines to come get you . You know that , don 't you ? Yeah , I do . Excuse me , sir . Sergeant is asking for you . Sir ? You , uh ... It just worked out like that . I 'm proud of you , son . Hey ... You all right ? Sure . When I took off from the nebraska state fair , I got caught in a freak storm And somehow slipped over to this side . It was a rough crossing , But when the clouds cleared , I was hovering over this crystal blue lake , And the most beautiful woman I 'd ever seen . My mother ? From that day on , I was hers . We married , two beautiful daughters . The perfect life . Until I messed it all up Letting the old witch escape . Your mother and I would given anything to keep that memory hidden from you . No . I have to know . Well , when your sister ... Killed you , When your mother gave you second life , We both knew something drastic had to be done , Both for the O. Z. and for you . That 's why I took you to the other side , Brought you to that tiny farmhouse . Why didn 't u stay ? Well , my job was here , To protect the secret of the emerald and prepare for u return . ? you and my mother could never be together ? There ! Azkadellia shield his mind . Raw cannot see . I 'll make this easy for you If you tell us everything you know about the machine . Bring it in . What do you got there ? What-what is that ? What , uh ... What , um ... Uh , what ... Are you , um ... O - okay , um ... Hold his fingers . No ... No ! No , wait , wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! No , not the fingers , not the ... Not the fingers - shut up ! I 'll tell you anything you want to know ! Oh , it 's too late . I 'll talk , okay ? - It 's too late ! Son ... Let him talk . Talk . The machine forms an intense beam of light . Why ? It focuses the power of the emerald at the double eclipse . Locks the two suns behind the moon . It 'll bring darkness to the O. Z. forever . Damn thing 's the anti-Sunseeder . Sunseeder ? Yeah , it 's a little doe I designed To slow the suns and extend the growing season . How do we shut it down ? - Ask him . Well , it sounds like what she is using it for is an entirely different barrel of monkey bats . I don 't know how her machine works . Part of you does ... Ambrose . - Ambrose ? Jeb ? Our spies found out " ambrose " is the code word for the brain that runs the machine . My marbe in the tower ? - Where are they ? Brain room . - Brain room , sub-level three . Look , i ... I 've told yourything that you need to know . Can you just ... Put that thing away . Just , put the thing away , okay ? Can you just ... Glad to . Jeb , what are you doing ? Job 's not done yet . Now we can finally finish this . Not like this . Put it away . This is the guy that killed mother . He destroyed your life and mine , and you want to let him live ? He deserves to die . - Yeah ! I won 't deny that , then what killing him won 't bring back your mother ... And it won 't honor her memory either . I think that means we 're here . But i don 't see anything . Your mother told me about this place , but i never dreamed it would be so beautiful . Who 's buried here ? The ones whose blood runs through your veins , a royal succession that lead to you . And the oldest rests here . She was your greatest great grandmother . The original slipper . First to make it through to the O. Z. From the other side . Dorothy gale . You were named in her honor . The emerald is guarded by the gray gale . This you must do alone . I 've been waiting for you . You 're dorothy ? The emerald of the eclipse is in your hands now . Come on . Adora ! Adora ! No ! It won 't be long until the eclipse . We have to hurry . Dg , you are everything i had hoped you 'd be . I am so proud of you . " I 'm so proud of you , my little girl . You 're everything i hoped you 'd be . " daddy ... You old romantic . - No ! Daddy ... I have missed you so much . What did you do to him ? He 's quite comfortable . You have something for me . Come on . You want to share your shiny new trinket with your big sister ? No ... You 're not my sister . It doesn 't look like much , does it ? But it has so much power . Green 's not your colour . I thought you were dead , little sister . Buried in the ground all these years . - You 're a ... No . It 's where you belonged . You look good in marble . Green marble . Make camp . We leave in an hour . What did you do ? If we stop azkadellia , we 'll be back for him in a few days . If not , he 'll be there a long time . I hope that 's justice enough for you . It 's not my first choice , but mother would approve . If you don 't have heart ... You have nothing . Oh , who am i kidding , this is all my fault . If i hadn 't thought of my machine in the first place , she never would have been able to twist it . Yeah . I 'm scared . I don 't know what to do . huh .. history is about to be repeated and this time i 'll get it right Are you sure you trying to find dg is the right thing ? She 's alive , i know she is . Someone in the realm has to know how to find the seeker . Dg is the key to bringing the witch down . Well , gods willing , i 'll see you at the tower then . Thank you . Okay , let 's move it , men . We don 't have much time . Don 't you look pretty . Good thing , ' cause i brought you a date . Is it really you ? I have dreamed of this day . Oh , i love you . Enough . Do you know how long i have waited to see that look on your face ? No phony smile , no brave front , just pure and utter shock . It may be the most honest gift you 've ever given me , mother . I am not your mother . Our daughter is really gone ? Both of your daughters are gone . Dg is dead ? Your little girl 's quest has ended as your royal line ends today , in darkness . Permanent darkness . Toto ! I can take you to dg . I know where she is . She 's in trouble . how we know you 're not lying to us again ? he 's speak truth allright where is she ? she 's along way to we better hurry hurry ! How ? Clear your mind . Remember how it felt when you were a little girl . How the light flowed through you . Concentrate , dg . Show me how she spins without touching it . You okay ? Dg ... Do you have the emerald ? Where is it ? She 's got it , cain . Okay , c 'mon let 's go . we don 't have much time Of course . Why would it be easy ? Well , if you guys can blow the generators that power those turbines , we can sneak in the same way we escaped . I 'll send my best men down to lay charges . Kind of boggles the noggin to think we 're going in there with all guns blazing . Well , let 's hope we 're the quiet part of this plan . We 're almost ready . - Have you guys seen raw ? I , uh , think he 's lost his nerve . Hey , raw , i wanted to show you something . That 's bad , right ? I mean ... You lost the emerald , so ... W - what does that mean ? It means ... That i don 't need it anymore . All that i need is right here . Raw ... You are no coward . You have taught me that courage is not about being fearless , it 's about standing up in spite of your fear , and you stood up to the papays , you threw yourself off a cliff , you escaped from prison . Raw do that for dg . No . You did that for you . Courage has been in you all along . You know , when i had a brain , i was twice as scared as i am now with only half a brain , which means that if i had no brain at all , i would be four times braver than i was when i was brainy . Glitch ... You 're the smartest guy i know . No , you 're just saying that to make me feel good . You helped me remember my past , and that 's probably the most important weapon i have now . Thank you . I know what you 're doing , kid . I 've led men through battle myself . And , um , how am i doing ? There 's less hugging when i do it ... But not so bad . We better get going - look ... You may not be able to save your sister . So if our plan doesn 't work , you will try to get out of there ... Right ? This is the one time that i 'm not going to be there to help . You 've already helped me , mr . Cain . I 'm serious . Don 't go up there and lose you head , and ... Forget about what 's really important . What 's really important is family . I can 't remember who taught me that . Good luck , mr . Cain . I want no interruptions once it begins . After 500 years , i want this moment to be ... Perfect . Forward light pulse is at 100 % . All we need now is power . The west wall , quickly ! Move , move , move ! The resistance is giving me a fireworks display . You three with me . - Yes , sir ! Let it begin . What is it ? - Intruders . We 're doubling the guard . This way ! Let 's go . Raw , which way ? Up one floor . All right , let 's do it . Good luck . I thought you hightailed it . Go . I 'll watch out . Go . Hey , look . I 'd recognize me anywhere . Glitch ... - Hmm ? It 's time to get reacquainted with yourself . Connect him to it . All right , glitch , i need you to remember something for me . Glitch , can you hear me ? My name isn 't glitch . It 's ambrose . Okay , ambrose . I need you to remember how you designed the sunseeder , and how to shut it down . Do you see the keyboard numbers that control the light pulsing ? Yeah , about a million of them . Which ones do i turn off ? Proper shut-down sequencing to reverse light pulsing is imperative - okay , which numbers ? What 's causing the problem ? Power surging in the brain cortex . Some kind of synapse interference . Get kalm . You two , come with me . Azkadellia ! There 's still time to stop this ! Look up ! The power of the emerald is about to lock the eclipse in the sky and bring permanent darkness to the O. Z. A fierce new world is awakening . No ! Listen to me , my sister ! This is not what you want ! Remember who you are ! Your sister is dead . No . Ah , good . I think it 's working . Why are we losing power ? And the last number to reverse light pulsing ... Yeah . One more , and it will be your last . No ! Don 't fire your weapon in here ! Kalm , tell me what they did and how to fix it . Now ! Turn on ... 1666 ... 14 ... One more number , kalm . I can 't find it ! I need the final number for full power ! Ah , good . Finally ... Permanent darkness . It 's over I won ! two little princesses dancing in a row spinning fast and freely on their little toes where the light will take you no one ever knows ... do you remember that time at the cave when you remembered what all those symbols meant ? You were so smart . It 's the picture language of the ancients ... " your adventures have a way of getting me into trouble , " that 's what you said . You said " you veadntures have a of getting me into trouble . Do you rememberpinning do how we made it fly together ? " concentrate ... " just concentrate , Deeg . And do you remember the bear ? How scary it was , and you stood up . You were so brave , it made me brave . Just hold my hand , deeg ! Nothing can hurt us if we stay together ! Hold my hand . Nothing can hurt us if we 're together . Take it . Take it ! Take my hand . I 'm sorry i let go , az . I 'm scared . I 'm here , and i 'll never run away again . Take my hand . You 're talking into the wind , girl . Take my hand . Not now ! Take my hand . Have the little bitch . I care not . For the heavens do my bidding ! The emerald ... Give me the emerald . Give me the emerald ! Hold on . I 'm not going anywhere . Leave him alone ! You never understood . All you people need is encouragement . Raw just need courage . Glitch ... Wake up . Come on , glitch , wake up . Hello . Do i know you ? Good morning , sweetheart . - Cain ! We need that last number to reverse the beam . Now , think . The number , ambrose . The number ! Is it my locker combination ? Come on ! My parents ' anniversary ? I can 't think ! I won 't let go . You can do this . I can 't think . - Feel . I - i can 't ... I can 't think . I know what to do . Hold on . If we can 't reverse the number , i 've got to shut it down . I 'm sorry , ambrose . No , no , wait ! Wait ... 1208 ! The queen 's birthday , of course . Commence the reverse pulsing ! She melted . My azkadellia ? - Mother ... Oh , is it really you ? The witch is gone . It 's over . Dg ! I thought i 'd never see you again . Welcome home . Thank you . That 's the O. Z. I remember . I 'm so glad to be home .

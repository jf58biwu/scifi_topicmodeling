Hot off the wire . - Donnelly 's leveled off . - We 're dead even . Look at this . Front page . Donnelly 's brother is like Roger Clinton Billy Carter and Ronald Reagan 's entire family rolled into one . Let 's move this out of the land of mere embarrassment into the realm of serious effect . Are you ready to play the game ? - I 've got some pretty nasty ideas . - Good . Act on them . - I 've been fired . - What ? Why ? He said the Rec Center 's state-funded .

Mike . The police officer who arrived before our guys was a friend of Mike 's . He let him leave and never even reported seeing him in there so Mike was never linked to the fire . are you finished stirring that drink or is this some kind of fucking science experiment ?

You talking about your brother 's election hopes orjust my career ? The person I care about most in my life hates me . I 'm an embarrassment . - So what do you wanna do today ? - I don 't care . Whatever you want . I wish we could watch your brother 's debate on TV . That 's today ? We gotta watch it ! hook a hanger up to the metal plate in your head ? I know a place with a TV . I saw it when we were putting up posters . It 's not far from here . Let 's go . Here it is . this had to be the place you knew . How could you have such horrible instincts and survive this long ? I met this guy . Nobody is home . Run ! Come on ! Move it ! Move it or lose it ! This guy 's got a hell of a security system ! Mr. Stone . Really . this guy is like Leatherface Chucky and Jan Brady all rolled into one . Norris Sabitch . And Grandpappy Winston . If only he had bought a smaller TV maybe he could 've afforded a couch with less urine on it . Yeah . I wanna see a Washington where children can walk down the street safely where people can leave their doors unlocked and their minds are free from fear . this is one area where I 'm in total agreement with Governor Tracy . I agreed with that statement when she made it at her first campaign for governor over eight years ago . my bro is knocking the snot out of her . - I 'm gonna go take a squeege . - Watch your step . If you really want to understand Mr. Donnelly 's view on family values and ask yourself this question . How far does the acorn fall from the tree ? Or should I say nut ? but who doesn 't ? Mike and I am very proud of him . And I believe that Mike 's problems are rather modest when compared to the problems facing our great state . And those are the problems that I am interested in ! Al . soldier boy . What the hell are you doing in my perimeter ? I 'm not a soldier . And I don 't know if you read in USA Today last week but the war is over . You can punch out now . let it go . Who told you that ? Charlie . I just talked to Charlie and he 's not mad at you anymore . So let 's call off " Operation One of Us is Crazy - and go our separate ways . - Don 't get smart with me ! If you don 't tell me who sent you on this mission I 'm easily within my legal rights to dispatch you with extreme prejudice . I just came back to get my rental car and an apology . I will gladly leave your coordinates here . The car ? - ls that all ? - That 's all ! Why didn 't you tell me ? - God ! Here 's the keys . - Thank you . And here 's my apology . I can splatter your cortex or I can explode your heart . Which sounds quicker to you ? That 's a toughie . Come on ! Nice moves . I 'm seriously impressed . Sergeant Drake Sabitch . How you doing ? Mike Donnelly . Nice to meet you . I wanna show you something . you ever watch any Bruce Lee movies ? come in . That damn debate should have never happened in the first place ! That son of a bitch Donnelly had a smart-ass comment to make ma 'am . It doesn 't matter . I can 't wait to see the look on his face when he goes down . but if he goes down . which our people think will be very high . or I 'll have your balls in a jar on my desk . A very small jar . Are you getting sleepy ? Good night . put in bed . dear . She 's totally legal . I 've got all her papers and I pay all the taxes . but " no speaka . Who ? What does he want ? but he says he thinks you 'll like it . Pardon me . this is Mr ... Mr. ' s fine . So here 's what went through my little head . I got some pictures of your boys setting the Pierce County Rec Hall ablaze . Or pictures that look like Mike Donnelly set the fire . I wait for election day to near . Whoever 's trailing gives good money for whichever picture does them best . My gut says I 'm glad you 're trailing . I 'll have to see the pictures first . Here 's the rub . Now you 'll have to tell me your name so I 'll know who to make out the check to . My best friends call me Cash . Steve . I go home . - Over there . - Did I make it ? 612 Caswell Street . What 's he doing ? I 'm stuck in this thing ! - Stop that ! - I 'm claustrophobic ! my God ! - Help ! - Stop that ! Are you crazy ? - I can 't breathe . Get this thing off of me ! ma 'am . I ... ma 'am . That is my fault . I 'm ... Here you go . ma 'am . Okay . Okay . I 'm sorry . You ... You stupid jerk ! What are you doing ? Look at this . Who 'd you vote for ? We now continue with our election night coverage . I bet the exit polls already have us by 10 points . So after the events of last night a slight shift in voter sentiment was expected but no one anticipated this . this photo was released linking Mike Donnelly to the scene of the Pierce County Recreation Center fire . The arson accusations against the disgruntled former employee came at the worst possible time for his brother Al Donnelly 's drive to the governor 's mansion . Governor Tracy is about to claim victory . It 's all my fault . My brother lost his election because of me . Tracy wins by 280 . Donnelly 834 . Tracy won Garfield County ? right ? 048 to 834 ? 882 votes . 502 voters up in Garfield County . Something isn 't right . The Governor is now on her way to campaign headquarters where she 's expected to make her victory speech . - Those are the guys that started the fire . - Those troopers ? but that is them ! we gotta call Al now . Wait a minute . I gotta do something first . Here it is ! Voter registration for Garfield County . I knew it ! Lookie here . Any of these names look familiar ? You were right . he got cheated . And we got proof right here . So we get on the phone and alert the press . Screw that . She embarrassed me in front of the whole state . She messed up things between me and my brother . Now it 's gonna be payback time . Where can I find her ? There 's a post-election ceremony at the Governor 's Mansion at 10 : 00 a.m. Nothing 's gonna stop us now . maybe we could use some help . We 'll meet you there . There 's no way we can do this without you . Sergeant Sabitch . I thank you . Okay . this is the biggest thing I 've ever asked of you . Are you sure it 's cool ? it 's not cool . And if you get pulled over I 'm gonna say the car was stolen so that I can keep my job . And one more thing . 'cause it 's been shorting out on me . Don 't forget . What is this all about ? We got to be there at 10 : 00 . people . Coming through . Official police business . I want you to step lively . Do not make me abuse my power . These guys think we 're real cops . - What the hell was that ? - A chunk of the road or something . I just chunked in my pants . You see that bug ? It smacked the windshield . I 'll get it . Here . Where is the fricking thing ? We got like levers galore in this thing . that was weird . That bug was coming at me I totally connected eyes with him . " I can 't stop ! Don 't wanna ! that was wild . It was so weird . dead ! But this map is heavy . It 's got all those robes on it . Rogues ? Roods ? - I can 't ... I can 't say that word . - Roads ! Roads ! isn 't it ? man . very freaky . I 'm stoned . So are you ! Row-woods . the nitrous oxide 's leaking into the car ! Man ! We got to ... We got to maintain . I think you just drive the speed limit . We 're gonna be cool . everything 's cool . I 'll just go the speed limit . - Limit . Limit . - Limit . That 's another one of those freaky words . Limit . Did you turn the siren on ? I can 't even find the glove compartment in this thing . my God ! we 're screwed . Get in the back ! Get in there ! buddy ? Transporting a prisoner . Twelfth Precinct up in Buckley town . so I 'm trying to do it lickety-split . do you have any idea how fast you were going ? Nitro Boosters . I can get her up to as good as 155 . unless I 'm chasing a cute chick in a Ferrari . I 'd guess I was going about 65 tops . Seven . Seven miles an hour . they pull onto the shoulder . I don 't know how you do things up in Buckley town but down here we are protective of the other drivers on the roads . - Row-ads . Roods . - Quiet back there ! I 've taken enough guff from you for one day . Raving psycho . Butchered 400 chickens and screwed a beagle . Taking him back to Nevada where he 's wanted for banging horses . Good God ! Then you get him through this state a little faster Officer ... Meoff . Jack . Go . - Man ! - What a goon ! man . That was genius . I never would 've thought of that . That was hot . Shit ! I hope there 's enough juice left in these boosters . See ya ! Man ! We 're live at the Governor 's Mansion . Today 's event is a celebration of Governor Tracy 's election to a third term . as welI as their families gathering for what appears to be quite a festive affair . must be all smiles today . We 're just receiving word that Mike Donnelly is involved in a high-speed police pursuit . wanted for questioning in an arson fire is driving down Capitol Boulevard in a stolen police car . head back to the Capitol ! crazy ? You can 't do this . - Do what ? don 't do this . Give me some time . I can make you a senator ! did it ever occur to you there is a time when family might be more important than career ? Ever occur to you that at some point you 're gonna have to make a choice between me and that loser brother of yours ? Go on up there and scope it out . Nobody 's gonna recognize you . Okay . Promise me you 'll stay right here . Thank you . Thank you very much . This election was about the majesty of democracy where the gathered masses held their vote high . coming in right now . My re-election could not have been possible without all the fine people throughout this state who supported me in this victory . Dennis intelligent children . Steve ! I 'm in ! man ? He 's supposed to be here . I 'm surprised we can 't count on a guy that lives in a school bus surrounded by land mines . All right . Here 's what we do . right ? What have you got in the tray ? Then we sneak around back . When Tracy starts to ... help . Steve ! get back here . the damn thing 's caught on my belt ! God ! Help ! Please ! I can 't ... I can 't ... God ! help ! Help ! - Hello . God ! - Stay . - Steve ! - Help ! - How are you ? Steve ? Please ! Somebody ! Somebody help me ! Somebody help me ! God ! Help ! The voters have spoken .

Give me a minute . Give me a minute . I 'll be fine . Nobody moves or Steve Dodds gets it ! - Who ? - Steve Dodds ! - Who 's this guy ? - Come on ! I 'm with the Donnelly campaign ! What does it matter ? - He 's got a gun ! You 're a cop ! - Get over here ! I 'll kill him ! I 'll kill him ! - I want that asshole taken out . - I 'll get a sharpshooter on it right away . Get your ass up there ! I 'll stick this ... Everybody back up or I blow the pipsqueak 's head off ! I 've got something to say ! Tommy and Sally ! - Shut up ! - All right . You keep your mouth shut ! take it . listen up ! This is serious business ! we 've all been screwed by Governor Tracy ! And now I 'm gonna screw her ! I have evidence here that you need to know about now before it 's too late ! what the hell are you doing here ? Man . sir . I know what I 'm doing . I 'm gonna prove you won the election . put the gun down . There 's other ways to handle this . there 's no other way ! You got to believe me ! I believe you . I believe you . I just ...

I 'll back you up . What do you want me to do ? Just let me explain to these people what happened . That 's it ! Game over ! I 'm not even getting paid for this ! This is not worth it ! Look out ! Get out ! Look out ! Okay ! Mr. Thundermaker here is gonna start barking fire if you don 't stop moving and listen to what this young man has to say . sir . a great American soldier . I 'd like to tell you a little bit about some other great American soldiers . Winston Sabitch whose name you 'll find at the top of this list . It says that he registered and voted for Governor Tracy . And we 're proud to have him as a voter . wench . The fact is Winston Sabitch was killed in the Argonne forest in 1918 . smashing his head clean out of his ass . sir . 1944 . Nelson Sabitch was killed near the 38th Parallel in Korea . these men managed to cast their vote for Evelyn Tracy . folks . Voter fraud . half these people are buried in the Garfield Cemetery .

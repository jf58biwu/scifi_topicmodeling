 Mr. Jones . Mr. Kohl . I have the appeal request All prepared and ready to go . It cause without saying that the gerenal government not big fans of yours . You did after all steal state 's secret . I think that the best we can hope for is life . Hmm ? All I need is your signature . Hey . Mornin ' . Is your father about ? Right here . Why don 't you ask him what he 's doing ? I would rather not . Listen , do you remember that prisoner Jones I went to see ... - In Germany , right ? - He escaped . Good for him . How ? Uh , nobody knows . It makes no sense . The German authorities came to see me last night . How come when nobody knows and it doesn 't make sense , They come to us ? Well , what we do know is that Jones Was working with Mitchel Loeb . I remember Loeb . That 's the guy who stole my invention . Yeah , I 'm gonna go and talk to him now . But can you describe to me again what you made ? What Loeb was stealing . And why don 't you tell her the truth this time . He kind of sugar-coated it last time around . You did ? Why ? Is it something that could have helped Jones escape ? It was a transportation device . I called it Dizray . Coined based on the premise Disintegration , reintegration . Dis-re , Dizray . Are you saying that you created ... A teleportation system , yeah . Except for this one 's meant to travel through time . How 's that ? Assuming someone could solve the considerable problems . Coming through , arriving Would require weeks of decompression In a barometric tank . And if you survived that , based on what would happen next , You 'd likely wish you hadn 't . So you 're saying that Jones , in theory , Could have zapped himself out of prison . Uh ... Yes . Disintegration is reached . Decompression is completed . Welcome back , Sir Cup of tea , please . Of course . Firstly , I 'd like to thank you For the work you 've done for bringing me here . I understand there have been sacrifices . I am grateful to them As I am to you . Everything is in order then ? Yes , sir . The list is complete . We 've got a lab set to your specifications . And the sealant ? All parts . Good . Hey , you know , it 's not a library here , you know . And I don 't make loans . Ah , 75 cents , my friend . 'Cause it 's old news now , Given the old internet and all that . You must be an old traditionalist Like myself , right ? Hey , hey , hey , I like these . You don 't see the two dollar very often . Thanks ! I 'll keep it . Okay , so , Tommie ... You were right . Yeah , you see that ? Grace Kelly ? She was good . But Jimmy Stewart was better . I 'm creatin ' cinephiles one reader at a time . Now , listen , I want you to check out a movie Called , uh , Charade . - Ever seen it ? - Never heard of it . Oh . Oh , god . Oh ! Oh , uh ... There 's something in my eyes . You okay ? I ... Ohh ... Oh , god . Tommie , you okay ? Oh , my eyes ! Oh , my god ! Aah ! Oh , Tommie ! Tommie ! Aah ! Someone ! Ohh ! Oh , Tommie ! Somebody call an ambulance ! Anything new ? We might be on something . Uh , nothing local on Jones . But , uh ... we found some financial records For Salman Kohl , Jones 's attorney . The man found dead in Jones ' cell ? He kept a slush fund that he maintained Under an assumed name . Could be a mistress . Or something less salacious . More interesting . Let me know if you find something useful . I know about David Robert Jones . I know that you helped him escape . And that you kidnapped me on that same night . You know where Jones is . You 're not someone I ... Really wanna work with . Your transfer order . To Wallens Ridge state prison . You know what that place is like , Mitchell . You know what they 're gonna do to you , What it 's gonna be like that first night ? The second ? Doesn 't matter if you find Jones or not . He 's just a part of the army . What was written will come to pass . And nothing you do can stop that . Nothing . Agent Dunham . It 's me . Get the bissagenous in the Boston general Name 's Thomas Avery . Runs a news stand downtown . His only prior physical conditions Were high cholesterol and a weak bladder . According to witnesses , ... the whole thing happened in less than two minutes . Ceramides . They act as a signaling molecule in skin . They control how the cells grow and differentiate . Two thoughts come to mind . The first , that this affliction might have been caused by a mutation , ... changing these lipids to recognize and seal any and all orifices . Did they check his anus and penis ? You think we could get the answer to that question without me in the room ? What was the other thought ? Sorry ? You said two thoughts came to mind . Ah , yes . The other was coffee cake . Tiny pebbles of cinnamon sugar . Once again , my father . You know what this is . You think Jones ? Help me with this . You talked to Loeb . Did he give anything ? Maybe , but nothing that relates to this , exactly . Well , I 'm not convinced this is Jones ' work . And what interest would he have in a newsstand operator ? That 's what we 're going to find out . Peter ... You got a sec ? When I saw Loeb , he said something . That Jones was only doing what had been written . Meaning what ? Written where ? I didn 't know , but we 've never known what Jones ' group ZTF stood for . Maybe it 's not the name of their organization . What if it 's the name of their Bible ? Interesting . So I called a contact at the German authorities ... And asked him to search any known document with those initials . Did he or she find anything ? Yes , he did . Z.F.T. Z.F.T. Scroll down . Destruction by advancement of technology . It 's a self-published anonymous manuscript . On their records only because it was recovered as evidence in a police raid in an unrelated case . They sending it to us ? They would be if it hadn 't been destroyed ten years ago . So ... I was hoping that you might have one of your weird connections . Weird connections ? They 're always a little weird . Well , you 're always a little weird . What do you think ? Come on . I think I got a weird connection . Is he contagious ? If he were contagious , We 'd have several more orificeless bodies by now . Scalpel , please , and an empty IV bag . Empty IV bag ? What exactly are we doing here ? The obvious . Searching for evidence . Any scientific clue to reveal what caused this ... Hear no evil , speak no evil , ... see no evil malady . The gas trapped within his body may yield important information . Worth the study . Oh , dear God , that is putrid . On a separate topic , do you like coffee cake ? Hey , take a look at this . I , uh , I know someone at the SEC I had her send over a list of every business That Jones 's lawyer has incorporated for his clients over the last three years . Figure maybe one of more of them are used to funnel cash to the Z.F.T. This is all protected by lawyer-client privilege . How did you get her to break that ? We , uh ... Dated in college . And she dumped me , bad , ... so I told her she owed me one . I ... I narrowed down the list to U.S. Addresses only . Good work . It 's no first folio . Some tanning , pretty badly shelf-cocked . I can give you 40 for it . Okay . You don 't wanna make that deal . First edition , THE LAND OF LAUGHS ? No matter what condition it 's in , ... it 's worth at least twice that . Ahem . Thanks . Have a great day . Was that really necessary ? Ah , you know me , Markam . Friend of the people . What about me ? Aren 't I people ? People who shower . Huh . Who 's this friend ? Olivia Dunham . $ 5.00 I can name at least one item on your night stand , Olivia Dunham . Don 't tell me ... You 're gonna like this . I 'm never wrong . It 's a gift . Okay , Toni Morrison novel , something by Obama , And / or the current issue of Bon Appetit . Uh , I 'm reading advanced forensic science by Annemann . I keep it next to my gun . I like this one . This one 's just a friend , and we need a favor . An anonymous , self-published manuscript . Uh , destruction by advancement of technology . Sounds sexy and very challenging . Peter says you 're good . Well , he also says that you 're just a friend , so ... The book , Markam . We need it . Today , right ? Right . Impress me . Nothing interests me less than impressing you . Think I might have something . Warehouse building in Austin , leased to Jones ' attorney . Power was cut off for months , two weeks ago was turned back on . The day Jones escaped from prison . Could be a safe house . This is Broyles . I need a search warrant authorized . - Sir ... - Yeah , a warehouse ... Sir , this can 't wait . - What is it ? - There 's a man downstairs says his name is David Robert Jones . Everybody down ! Don 't move ! Jones ! Freeze ! I will speak only with agent Olivia Dunham . And he just turned himself in . Two hours ago . Said he 's only speak to agent Dunham . Hasn 't said a word since ... Anything else ? Anything on how he escaped from prison ? No information . Just another question . A key . What key ? It was found on him when he turned himself in . There are no markings on it . Forensics is doing their thing . He wanted us to find it . He wants to talk to me . Let me in there . Jones doesn 't get to dictate the terms of his captivity . He wouldn 't be a captive if it wasn 't under his terms . The only reason Jones is here is because he wants to be . Well , that may be the case , but the United States doesn 't negotiate with terrorists . That 's exactly the kind of arrogance he 's expecting . What did you say ? The man was clever enough tostar trek himself out of a maximum security German prison . Elude Interpol , arrive in Boston , and get himself apprehended . Simply because he liked the idea . He 's expecting us to reject his request . And your choice is what ? Give Jones what he wants to demonstrate that we can be anti-dogmatic ? I don 't think that 's what you 're saying , is it , agent Dunham ? Since he arrived in town , an innocent man was killed in a shocking and gruesome way . We don 't know that was Jones . It was Jones , and he has more planned . And you know that how ? I don 't know how to justify a hunch . Sanford , I don 't see any harm ... This isn 't a gentleman 's club , Ms. Dunham . Mr. Jones doesn 't just get to choose the pretty one . You wanna get him to talk ? Join the raid on that warehouse in Austin . See what you find . - How is that ... - Relevant ? Well , because right now , he 's just an escaped prisoner . But if he 's playing games , as you say , I doubt he 's here to help us . So show me some hard evidence that connects him to that incident downtown . Agent Dunham . I got it ... the ZFT book . Stop it . Already ? Markam found some guy who collects scientific ephemera . He had a copy in his basement . The thing was never published . It was never even proofed , but check this out . " the advances of science , " " which are supposed to expand " " our knowledge of the universe , " " will , if not carefully controlled , " " destroy the world as we know it . " So it 's light reading ? Wait , it gets better . " our technological hubris " " has brought us not to the brink of catastrophe , " " but to the actuality of it . " " but what form will this inevitable deconstruction " " of reality take ? " " the answer , to use a term generally understood " " but the specifics of which you cannot imagine " " and which this document will attempt to describe " " is warfare . " Well , keep reading . Will do . Where you headed ? We 're going to raid a building that we think may be a safe house . Alpha team clear . Bravo clear . What is this ? It is me . He was here . I want everything bagged and tagged ! Move fast ! I 'd like to ask you some questions . Oh , I believe I made myself clear . There is another I wish to speak to . I 'm afraid agent Dunham is preoccupied . So lucky you . You get me . Well , you don 't look well . Which is why I was hoping to speak with agent Dunham as soon as possible . I prefer to avoid any additional , unnecessary deaths . When agent dunham comes to see me , I 'll require the following items . A standard walkie-talkie with removable crystals , a metallic ballpoint pen , and an eyeglass repair kit . An analog wristwatch . Your watch would do . You sure you don 't need anything else ? Quite sure , yes . Anything ? Nothing . All right , let 's lock it up and get back . What the hell ? I need a med kit ! Now ! Quick , help me hold him . He 's suffocating . I need to trach him . Oh , come on , come on . Okay , breathe . Okay ... he 's breathing . No , no , no , no , no ! Uhh ! Ah , God . Where are we ? We 've got audio . Visual coming up right now . Yeah . Move in closer on this . I want to record every twitch . Oh , finally a welcome face . A colleague of mine just died . He was 27 years old . He was due to get married next month . Yes , I tried to prevent that . Your agent Harris needed some convincing . Here I am . Have you brought the items I requested ? This will only take a moment . Pull in tighter on this , on the hands . What the hell is he doing ? That 's a $ 1,000 watch . Whoa ! What 's happening in there ? I don 't know . Now I 've ... managed to get us some privacy . It 's just you and me now . But we haven 't much time . You were responsible for what happened to Thomas Avery . Simply the stage setter . An example that doesn 't need to be followed . Well , that implies that you 're planning something else . Something far worse , yes . What is it ? First ... I need your services . What the hell do you want ? I need you to pass a test . Get them out of there . That device he 's made Is blocking our surveillance equipment . He can 't hurt us , Sanford . He 's just trying to show you who 's in charge . When I turned myself in , There was a key in my pocket , as I 'm sure you 're aware . Take the key , which I assume is in forensics . Go to Salem , the amusement park on Policy Street . I 've left something there for you . You need medical attention . All the assistance ... In this world ... Could not cure me , Ms. Dunham . It seems ... That when one is dematerialized On a molecular level and then reassembled , There are certain unadvertised side effects . But who knows ? Perhaps this task I have for you Could lead to something that might help me . Tell me about the attack you 're planning . I wouldn 't call it that . I 'd call it an insurance policy . I don 't care what you call it . Even as we speak , a white cargo van Is transporting an explosive device Capable of killing several hundred people In the manner of the newspaper-salesman and your diseased FBI colleague . When is it set to go off ? 16 hours from now . Before anything , you are going to disable that ... No , you are . But first , there 's the matter of the key . That 's enough . I want you out of this room . Don 't worry , Ms. Dunham . If I wanted to harm you , I would have . Long ago . Apologies about the watch . Jones is planting a device somewhere Capable of killing more people in the same way That guy from the news stand died . He won 't say where or when . But we need every white van Rented within the last 48 hours Tracked down . In the meantime , I need two hours alone . Why ? Where are you going ? To get a massage . I 'll tell you when I get back . Hey , it 's me . Where are we at ? We know how the folks are ending up faceless . It 's a powdered toxin . It 's absorbed through the skin . It triggers a hyperactivity In the protein responsible for scar tissue . You want any more detail than that ? Uh , not really . Did you hear that Jones turned himself in ? Yeah , I did . You get anything ? Yeah , that he 's crazy . And he 's planning on using that toxin again , and soon . How 's Walter coming with the antidote ? He 's working on it . He says , and I quote , " It 'll be ready when it 's ready and not a moment before . " Great , anything more in the manuscript That might suggest what Jones ' end game is ? Well , it reads like a happy combo Between an anti-science manifesto And a call to arms . Call to arms against whom ? Exactly . I 'll call you back when I get to the good part . Yeah , please do . Maybe it 'll help us figure out Where this next attack is gonna be . - I 'll be back as soon as I get the package Jones left me . - OK . - Was that Olivia ? - Yeah . Where 's the manuscript ? Is she bringing coffee cake ? No , she 's not getting food . Have you seen the manuscript that I was reading earlier ? It 's ... fascinating , isn 't it ? I was just reading it whilst sitting on the crapper . Please , no more information than that . Can I have it back ? I must read you one excerpt . Great , well , grab the blanket . It 's nap time . We think we understand reality , but our universe is only one of many . The unknown truth is that the way to travel between them has already been discovered by beings much like us , but whose history is slightly ahead of our own . The negative effects of such visitation will be irreversible both to our world and to theirs . It will begin with a series of unnatural occurrences , difficult to notice at first ... but growing , not unlike a cancer , until a simple fact becomes undeniable . Only one world will survive . And it will either be us or them . Miss Dunham , I know how this appears . That I 've sent you quite a distance to pick up a child 's board game . But what I 've hidden here is not a game at all . You 're holding an evaluation system , a series of tests designed to cultivate specific , innate skills present in particular individuals . Do the first test only . Complete it successfully , and come back to see me . Do this , and no one else will die . I got the instructions . So Jones is threatening to kill hundreds of people unless I take a test . No , unless you pass a test . Fine . What is my passing a test have to do with Jones killing innocent people ? In a word , insanity . You can 't pose rational questions when you 're dealing with a guy like Jones . Indeed . And whatever Mr. Jones ' true goal may be , we only have eight hours left until his next attack . Test one ... of ten , by the way . Turn switch on . The recruit sits no more than 24 inches from the device but cannot touch the light board . Recruit focuses on light board . The object of the test is to systematically shut down the lights so that ultimately none are flashing . How ? Using all your magic powers , I guess . Curious . The instructions refer to the recruit . The author of the manuscript ... uses the same term . Many warriors of the inevitable confrontation are among us now . But before they can be considered soldiers , they must be regarded as recruits . And the expectation must be that they shall be unwilling . So I 'm supposed to just turn these lights off by looking at them . Well , it wouldn 't be much of a test if we could just take out the battery . Fine . Dunham . We just got a hit . Steady Car Rentals in New Haven leased a white van yesterday morning ... thought you gonna love this , to one Olivia Dunham . - No . - Oh , yeah , he 's messing with you , Liv . Got local police scouring the area . So far , no luck . Thanks , Charlie . This is just a stupid mind game . Where are you going ? To end it . I will not let him use that device again . If you 're gonna meet with Jones , I want full surveillance this time . Sir , the last time you got your way , we lost a good agent . Do you really want to get in the way again ? We have less than seven hours before something truly horrific will happen . Something that I 'm trying to stop . For some reason , Jones is out to get me . So sir , would you please let me handle this ? - I got your test kit . - You didn 't bring it ? No , I didn 't need to , ' cause this is ... Your reluctance is to be expected . I know what you 're doing , Mr. Jones . I 'm trying to get you to pass test number one . I know about the manuscript . The manifesto , Z.F.T. I know that you believe that there 's some kind of war coming . You read it ? And that you 're recruiting warriors . That 's the word you used , isn 't it ? You don 't believe you 're worthy ? I believe that everybody , maybe even you , is entitled to their own belief system . But somehow , you got me into your head . Somehow . Yes . You 're among those treated with cortexiphan . It 's why we had you taken . We needed confirmation . Something which requires a spinal tap . The next step , had you not escaped , was to convince you of this . I have never been treated with cortexiphan . I haven 't even heard of it . You wouldn 't have . Well , I don 't believe you , Mr. Jones . What I believe is that you 've created some ridiculous scenario where people 's lives rely on me attempting and failing what is obviously an impossible task . The task is hardly impossible ! I will not let these people die because of some stupid game that you 're playing . This is no game ! You need to cooperate , Mr. Jones . No , Ms. Dunham ! It is you who needs to cooperate ! Mr. Jones ? Pulse is slowing down to 50 beats per minute . Get him up there . Astrid , set up the EKG ! Is this the patient ? Walter , put the cow away , would you ? What is this place ? It 's a freak show . Thanks for your help . Thank you . What 's happening ? You understand , this man teleported through space . His molecules disintegrating and reintegrating . The very implications of it ... We need a video camera . We should record this . Walter , this man is our only chance To stop a device that could kill a lot of innocent people . I need you to stabilize him . Of course . Okay . Point taken . I 'll do a thorough exam . Meanwhile , get me 50ccs of saline , please . Hey , Astrid , do you mind ? Sure . No , of course they did . Why am I not surprised ? Thanks , Charlie . Anything ? Yeah . That drug cortexiphan . It 's a drug patented but not approved by the FDA . Patented to whom ? Massive Dynamic . Why am I not surprised ? That 's what I just said . Jones ? Jones ? Walter 's replenishing his fluids right now . But he 's still gonna have to give him a full exam Before we even know if we can wake him back up . Look , I 'm gonna go find out what I can About cortexiphan , but in the meantime , He 's actually expecting me to be able to do it . To do what ? Test number one . The flashing lights . Jones won 't cooperate unless I pass the test . You think we can trick him ? What are you asking me to do ? You want me to open up the light box ? You could see what you could do . thank you so much for seeing me at such short notice . As I said , I am always available to you , Olivia . What can I do ? - I need information on a drug called cortexiphan . - Let me check . Is everything all right ? My hand , it 's been acting up . I need to have it looked at . Oh , yes , I recall this . Cortexiphan . It was part of a clinical trial Of a drug that dr . Bell created in ' 81 . What is it ? If you don 't mind . Dr. Bell theorized that the human mind at birth Is infinitely capable , And that every force it encounters ... Social , physical , intellectual ... Is the beginning of the process he referred to As limitation , A diminishing of that potential . And cortexiphan ? It was meant to limit that limitation To prevent the natural shrinking Of that brain power . - To prevent , not undo ? - Meaning ... That the drug was administered to children ? Yes . The drugs were extensively animal tested . They were harmless to the children who received them . Unfortunately , they were also unsuccessful . So dr . Bell abandoned his research on cortexiphan In 1983 . Were their trials ? Dr. Bell conducted the trials himself At Ohio State University , wooster campus . Nowhere else ? No . Why ? If you don 't mind me asking Nothing . That 's good to know . No matter what Jones believes , I was never given that drug . William Bell conducted his trials in ohio . In 1981 , I was three , living in Jacksonville , Florida . My dad was stationed at the naval base there . That 's good . In other news , Walter thinks he 's gonna be able to revive Jones soon . And I was able to reprogram the light box . - We should be able to fake Jones out . - I knew you can do it . See you soon . If there 's cardiac arrest , we 'll need nitroglycerin . Peter , prepare ... Mr. Jones , we have two hours Before your planned attack hits . And I think I 've passed test number one . Dr. Bishop ... Without your extraordinary work , I wouldn 't have the pleasure of making your acquaintance . I locked the teleporter away for a reason . One of which you are now experiencing . nevertheless ... It is an honor . Jones , I pass the test ... You tell us everything we need In order to stop whatever it is you 're planning . That was always the deal . Well done , Ms. Dunham . Thank you . Your turn . Indeed . 923 church street . The 47th floor . You better hurry . This is agent dunham . I need immediate evac . 923 church street . There 's a device on the 47th floor . Nicely done . Good performance . I need these streets cleared now ! Anyone within a four-block radius has to move ! Go ! Double-time ! Hey , where are we ? Building 's about 70 % clear . We lucked out . They 're undergoing renovation , So not all the floors are occupied . So the device ... This one 's a real mess . Bomb squad said they can 't move it or diffuse it . Why ? Because they 've never seen wiring like this before . Oh , my god . It 's rigged here for a reason : To blow out the windows . Four blocks ain 't gonna cut it . Not even close . I 'm on it . Contact the weather service . We need to map the fallout pattern , and get ... up to speed . Agent Farnsworth . Hey , it 's me . That son of a bitch knew what we were doing . What ? He knew that we were faking him out . Is he still conscious ? Barely . Put him on . It 's Olivia . Hello , you . I can 't do this . I remain confident that you can . Look , you know what I did before , it wasn 't real . Yes ... I know , Ms. Dunham . Before they can be considered soldiers , they must be regarded as recruits , and the expectation must be that they shall be unwilling . Mr. Jones , I am willing . I am willing , but I am not able . Olivia , we gotta go . There 's only one way to disable that device . You know what that is . Okay . You think that I 'm valuable . Valuable enough to kidnap , to try and train . You are a rare commodity , true . Okay ... if you don 't deactivate this device , I 'm gonna die , which means that your rare commodity is gone . But I have one thing , Ms. Dunham , that you do not . I have faith in you . There is no red wire , no blue . Only black . Cut any one of them , and the device blows . Try and remove it , and the device blows . If those lights are flashing when the timer reaches zero , the device blows . There is only one way out . And it 's you . Okay , we need to get these people out of here . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Where are you going ? Olivia , we gotta go . What did Jones say ? Olivia ... I need to do this . There is no other way . If you stay here , you are going to die . I 'm not doing this with you , Olivia . You are out of your mind . You did it . What was that ? How did you do that ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Farnsworth . Yes , sir . Thank you . We ... we will . Wait ... Wait , wait , wait . She did it , didn 't she ? It seems she did . My girl . You okay ? I didn 't do anything ... with those lights , they ... He planned it . Jones , it was all just a mind game . How did he plan it ? Plan what ? They were programmed to turn off when the countdown ended . Maybe , but ... He couldn 't have known when you were gonna arrive . He couldn 't have known the timing on that . Well , that 's what he did . Look , I 'm the last person to subscribe to this kind of stuff , but you were in the zone out there tonight , Olivia . The way you stared down that light box was like nothing I 've ever seen before . It wasn 't me . Fine , then , let me play devil 's advocate . Why did Jones choose you at all ? Because of your father . He wanted to meet your father . He wanted to meet the man who designed the device that let him escape from prison . And you think that 's what all this was about ? Okay ... fine . Look , all I know is I didn 't die tonight . So I 'm pretty much willing to accept any explanation you wanna give . You wanna go get a drink ? Or five ? I 've seen you with a whisky bottle . Jones was just transferred to Boston general , so ... I have a few questions for him . It 's my last chance . Yeah . So in all the excitement of today , I forgot to say something . I haven 't overlooked the fact that you actually created a teleportation machine . Well ... I suppose I did . Which , despite the fact that using it kills you , is ... pretty damn cool . Kills you ? It does something unthinkable , but ... it doesn 't kill you . Hello . Agent Dunham ? Nina Sharp . Hand 's back to normal . Well , good for you . I was curious about that question you asked . Whether there were other places where cortexiphan was tested . Yes ? There was , it turns out , a second clinical trial . Though much smaller than the one in Ohio . There was ? Yes , in Jacksonville , Florida . At a military base . Agent Dunham ? Thank you very much for calling . You 're most welcome . Have a good night .

You couldn 't keep a tail on two civilians in a pickup truck ? Find them ! NARRATOR : Pursued by Lee and forced underground , they build their own submersible . rich : If man went to the moon in a tin can , we can do this . Emergency lifeboat . If you have to surface quickly , flip the switch inside , the boat inflates . NARRATOR : They risked their lives to document the mysterious creatures and show the world . This is Dr. Laura Daughtery and Rich Connelly amidst a pod of the new vertebrates . But something goes very wrong . ( GLASS shattering ) What the hell ? Jackson , do you copy ? We are falling way too fast ! You got to pull us back up ! You got to stop us ! Now , Surface continues . ( helicopter WHlRRlNG ) Looks like they 've been here a little over a week . We just missed them . Where do you think they went ? Down . ( rich groaning ) Laura , hang on to something ! ( BOTH shouting ) ( SUB CREAKlNG ) ( WATER trickling ) rich : Oh , God . Rich . ( BOTH gasping ) You 're bleeding . Where the hell are we ? This is where we 're supposed to be . We 're gonna die . This is where we 're supposed to be . Hey , Skinny ! Skinny ! You got a half inch wire stripper for me ? What happened to the last pair I gave you ? ( chuckling ) You 're a damn disgrace . You is gonna cost me an arm and a leg .

Oh , my God . ( police siren blaring ) sheriff : Paul , I wanna thank you for coming down . Dr. Meyers , this is Paul Bloom from the Fort Fisher Aquarium . Myers , here , is our Charleston County coroner . So , how can I help ? Well , we 're hoping you can identify the animal that did this . The flesh is cut clean . Looks like a serrated edge to me . I was thinking , maybe a sand shark ? They don 't come this far upriver very often . Some kind of cat , a bobcat or Carolina panther , maybe . Well , if it 's a panther , it 's the first one seen in this state in 50 years . There 's also this ... PAUL : Yeah , what is that ? Well , the skin is charred . Is it chemical burns ? No , it 's electrical . Electric eel ? Hey , you ladies need to stay back ! We have a rogue gator out here . I got something . I think they 're tracks . Tracks . Over here . Hey , let 's get a cast of that before the tide comes in . I saw that at the mall . Thought you might want it for your collection . Thanks . I 'm sure Nim 's fine . He 's probably happy out in the wild . Yeah . No shrimp . The sea 's empty this season . Like something 's run everything off . What the hell is that ? I 've just gotta get this reserve battery to work . Since we have no lights , no power , no life raft ... We would have been at the surface by now if you hadn 't stopped me , Rich . ( GROANS ) Scrubber 's soaked . Wet , so the line can 't absorb the CO2 . How long does that give us ? About 90 minutes . Less , if more carbon monoxide gets in here . It might not seem like it now , but ... We 're gonna be okay . ( rich mumbling ) Rich . Rich . Hey , listen to me . I 'm begging you , listen to me , okay ? I need you to help me out . You got to snap out of this , okay ? Please snap out of this . Rich ? Rich ! We are going to die if you don 't help me now , okay ? Okay . What do I need to do ? You need to make that battery work . Where 's my ratchet ? It 's right here . Look , look here . ( METAL clinking ) All right . ( electronic buzzing ) All right . ( BOTH gasping ) Power 's good . Power 's on . Okay . Okay , so the compressor is gonna inflate the life raft and then we go up . Wait ! Hang on , hang on ! Wait ! Hold on to something . Just wait , wait , wait . Wait for what ? 'Cause , ' cause , this is it . What are we waiting for ? Wait . I just want to think it through for a sec , 'cause , you know ... Rich , there 's nothing to think about . Let 's just do this , okay ? Please ? Rich , we 're gonna go back to the surface . Okay ? Look at me . Okay ? Okay . Yeah ? Okay , hold on . It 's not working . We gotta do it one more time . It 's not ... You ready ? Hold on . Yeah , it 's not working . JARED : Hey , Miles ? Hey , don 't worry about the scrubbers right now , I need you to cover for me in Director Bloom 's office . Okay . What 's up ? I 've gotta run these down to the Sheriff 's office . An electrician got bitten yesterday in the marsh by some critter . Really ? Yeah , really . Killed him . Ripped his throat out . What do they think did it ? It 's a conundrum . Massive tissue lacerations like a shark attack , bizarre electrical burns . Yeah . Well , of course . No , the victim was in the shallows . Yeah . Well , there wasn 't that much of the neck left , to be honest . Yeah . It 's got a foot pad like a mammal , long claws , webbed feet , like an otter or a seal . Yeah , I think I got time to make the last pick up . You 're the intern , right ? Yeah . I want you to ship this to David Howell in the zoology department at N.C. State , all right ? I want him to get a look at this . Oh , man . Yeah . Maybe it was self-defense . Mmm-hmm . Maybe they provoked it somehow , and tried to hurt it . Oh , yeah . You should have seen the victim 's eyes . They were turned to jelly by the electrocution . PAUL : Yeah . Tomorrow morning I 'm going to the fisheries . I 'm gonna examine the catches . I 'm gonna need you here at 7 : 30 tomorrow morning to help me with the specimen containers , all right ? The life boat 's just wedged on something . All right , maybe I 'll ... I 'll check the radio . Maybe by some chance Jackson can hear us . Where is it ? Where is it ? Okay . ( radio crackling ) Jackson ! Jackson ! SOS , Jackson , can you hear me ? Jackson ! Can you hear us ? Save it , Laura . Jackson ! ( METAL clicking ) Okay , we just have to think . Oh , God . Jesse . Don 't start doing that , okay ? It 's gonna be all right . You 're gonna be all right . You 're gonna see Jesse again . Just like I 'm gonna see Tracy , and my girls , and my dog again . I took this leap of faith , I got us down here , and I 'm telling you , George ain 't gonna let me down , okay ? Are you there , Georgie boy ? I need you . ( NlM crying ) Shut it ! ( NlM growling ) You son of a ... You want some of this ? ( NlM growling ) You wanna live long enough for us to sell you , you better shut up . I 'm gonna put you on ice . ( LAUGHS ) ( SHlVERlNG ) LAURA : About an hour left . All right . A little less . Just give me one more second , and I should have those lights up outside . We can get the lay of the land . ( LOUD static crackling ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( CREATURE whining ) Rich , you hear that ? rich : Almost there . Rich , do you hear that ? Listen . Got it ! No , no , no , no , no ! Shut the lights off . Yeah , let 's go . Off , off ... I think we should keep the lights off . Me , too . Did you see how many there were ? Yeah . You know , I also saw something else out there . What ? It gave me an idea . If ... Well ... I thought ... I thought I saw a bang stick that still had a live charge on it . Now , if we can somehow tilt this thing and detonate that charge . Then maybe it 'll ... Maybe it 'll free up the life raft . Okay . It 's worth a try . Watch out . Okay . Push . Okay . ( BOTH grunting ) Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Rich , stop ! Rich , stop ! We 're wasting air . We 're wasting air . ( coughing ) The air is running out . We have 37 minutes left . Oh , what the hell ? What ? There 's a man out here . What ? There 's a man out here on the ocean floor ! Look ! Come here ! Do you see him ? Do you see him ? Huh ? Do you see him ? Don 't start freaking out on me , Rich . No , no , no , no . No , no . Where 'd he go ? Where 'd he go ? miles : So , before I shipped them , I took these . " ... whose body was found early Saturday morning . " Authorities speculate that the animal might have been an alligator . " Those are totally Nim 's feet , dude . You don 't know that . He 's got the taste of human blood and he 's on a spree . Nim is not on a " spree . " Your problem is you think you speak Nim . You don 't speak Nim . No one speaks Nim . Nim 's a tiger . Tigers communicate . And what good did that do Roy , hmm ? Siegfried and Roy ? Roy raised that tiger , dude . But sooner or later , the tiger grows up and the wild animal kicks in . This guy was food , dude . That was not Nim . You need to rat on the lizard ! Dude , you saw the way police deal with this kind of thing . They 'll kill him . But I gotta get to him first . We trained Nim to come to the sound of the bell for food . So , if we broadcast the sound underwater and loop it , so it repeats over and over . Dude , you can 't put my boom box in the water . We 'll waterproof it . Check it out . Aquaphonic speakers . Dad has them all around the pool . And a dry suit . Neck holes , doof ? Hand holes ? Chip clips . You are the gadget master . All right , I got to go meet Dr. Bloom at the docks . Meet me back here at dusk . And take care of this . You got it . ( BELL TlNKLlNG ) ( WATER trickling ) I can 't see a damn thing out there . ( GRUNTS ) This is Laura Daughtery onboard the submersible , Little Heat . Our position is 41-46 North , 50-14 West . We are stranded at the bottom of the ocean . We need immediate assistance . ( static crackling ) Jackson probably went for help by now . But the only DSRV on the West Coast is six hours away . ( MAN chattering ON radio ) Did you say something ? Hello ? Hello , do you hear me ? Can you hear me ? Is there anyone out there ? Please respond . ( MAN speaking in JAPANESE ) It 's not English . What is it ? ( speaking in FRENCH ) There you go , there you go . Come on , now . Keep it up ! Keep it up ! Please respond . Please respond . Do you hear us ? We 're trapped at the bottom of the ocean ! We 're in a submersible ! ( MAN speaking in JAPANESE ) What is that ? What did he say ? That ain 't French . It 's ... It 's Japanese or something . Do you speak English ? Do you speak English ? Please , please respond . SOS , mayday ! Mayday ! We are on the bottom of the ocean . Please , mayday ! Mayday ! Please ! SOS ! Oh , God , we have 30 minutes . It 's fbi . San Francisco SAC . I interfaced with the Coast Guard , NOAA deep search . We did pick up a distress signal actually . I 'm sending it to you over a secure line . ( static crackling ) LAURA : Jackson ! SOS , Jackson , can you hear me ? Is that something you 're interested in ? Yes . Yes , it is . Did you find any surface vessels in the area , something that could launch a submersible ? Negative on the surface vessels . We 've had a lot of tough weather off the coast . Electrical storm . I 'm also looking for this man . Jackson Holden . All right . I 'll run a search , put the name on the wire . Look , this distress signal , is this real ? Yes . Well , I know the C.O. of the Reagan . I could get the DSRV . No . No rescue efforts . And destroy that sound file . ( BEEPlNG ) What sort of bycatch are you looking for ? That kind of falls under the category of , " I 'll know it when I see it . " You 're welcome to take a look , but all the nets got excluders and BRDs . Cuts the incidentals in half . You notice anything strange about this spot ? It looks kind of scrawny . That 's right . It 's starving . You see the flattened belly profile , and the down-turned head , and the reddened mouth ? That means it 's feeding off the bottom . Where 'd all its food go ? I have no idea . Six months ago , all of our indicators species-wide just spiked in the wrong direction . Hey ! Yeah ? Anything out of the ordinary comes in here , I 'd appreciate you letting me know . You might want to talk to the sports-fishing guy . Heard some crazy stories about the mackerel run . ( MAN speaking in spanish ) Big flash , it was like lightning in the water , and the king floated up . Dead on the line . Lightning in the water ? Yeah . How long ago did this happen ? Yesterday , 6 : 09 a.m. You have a good memory . Memory 's not it . It stopped my watch cold . ( speaking in spanish ) Bite marks are deep , reminiscent again of the former . Electrical burns , more of them . Much more than the previous victim . This thing travels in packs . I 'll tell him . Sheriff just called . Said some guys down at Cape Fear caught our predator . What ? How did they catch him ? Apparently with bullets . Got to be 15 feet long if it 's an inch . Biggest gator I 've ever seen , Sheriff . I know . It 's huge . Hey , Paul ! Watch your step . Careful , guys . Listen , thanks for coming down . I 'm sorry to have taken you away from your dinner . Look at this . You won 't believe this . Snuck right up on a couple guys in that blind , fired both barrels each into its head . Just get over here and give us a hand , would you , buddy ? PAUL : May I ? This gator hadn 't eaten in three days . He 's not our predator . You sure ? Now I 'm telling you , what we 're looking for is not indigenous . All right , Paul , then what is it ? I don 't know . I think we 're looking for an alien species . ( MEN laughing ) Alien-Australia . Alien-China . Okay , then , we 'll sound the horn , post a reward , and get some eyes in the water . Wait a minute . You don 't even know what you 're looking for . The last thing you need is a bunch of hotheads chumming the water , killing everything in sight . And the last thing I need is another somebody else getting hurt . I 'm gonna charter a boat with some professional fishermen , who know how to handle these things . Yeah , " Handle it . " That 's right ! Eli ! Lalo ! KEMPER : The hold ! I 'm on it , Captain . Lalo ! Hold , now ! Yeah . Fucking crap . Hey , how can it be so hot ? That thing . ( GROWLlNG ) ( screaming ) LAURA : When Jesse was about three , we had this talk about life and death and God . And so , I told him , I didn 't know who or what God was , or ... I said , maybe that he was all around us , in nature , in the air we breathe . So , he took off his shoe , hands it to me , and there 's an ant smashed , dead on the bottom of his shoe . And he leans into me and he says , " Mommy , I smushed God . " And I said , " Honey , that 's okay . People make mistakes . " And he had this guilty look on his face , you know , so guilty . And I said , " Peanut , what 's the matter , what 's wrong ? " And he leaned into my ear and whispered , " Mommy , I ate God , too . " Yeah . ( BOTH laughing ) ( crashing ) Hey , hey , hey , hey ! That was close . Get the camera . And a flashlight . Do you have the flashlight ? Yeah , yeah . Here , here . Where ? rich : What 's he doing ? Laying eggs . Laying eggs . big : Step back from there . Sorry , Doctor . Sir , I wanted to give you an update on the specimen . Mmm-hmm ? I tracked it to Northern California . Who was with you ? I took a few grunts from Northern Command . Sir , I talked to the HASMAT teams . They had a tough time killing the specimen . Eventually had to use radiation . Do you mind if I ask , what is it ? The quicker question is , " What isn 't it ? " Do you recognize this ? It 's a griffon . Half eagle , half lion . A mythological hybrid . A chimera . An improvement . ( BELL TlNKLlNG ) Dude , it 's time . Give it up . Nim ! Nim ! Nimmy ! Seriously , before we fry the box . Electricity and water don 't mix . Electricity and water ... That 's where he 'd go . Where ? Come on ! ( NlM growling ) Good God , Eli . It took some doing , but I got him . Just throw the damn thing overboard . I plan to , but not before I make sure he ain 't coming back up . ( NlM GRUNTlNG ) ( NlM screeching ) miles : He 'll come here . I know it . phil : How do you know it ? Because Nim always goes for the current . I 've seen him stick his tongue in a socket before . No way . Critter Pop Rocks . Yeah , it 's like he gets drunk on electricity . Hey , dude , one time I stuck a straw in my nose and snorted root beer . I cried root beer . It was awesome . That 's great , Phil . ( stammering ) I know he 'll come . Look , look . That 's him . It 's Nim . Wait a minute , man ! Faces of Death , my brother . He 's a tiger . I know . You just have to know how to talk to tigers . Nim . Nimmy , come here . It 's me . Nim ? Where did you go ? Nim ? You 're not Nim . You 're smaller . Miles , get out of there , man ! Ow ! Dude , get out of there , man ! Watch out ! ( knocking ON DOOR ) RON : Miles ? Miles ? Just a sec . ( CHATTERlNG ON TV ) Hey , Miles , if you borrow my CDs ... ( DOOR closing ) Oh , my God . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . What happened ? Don 't tell Mom . I 'm fine . Nim did that . No , it wasn 't Nim . This one was smaller . There 's more than one ? They travel in a pack , like a swarm . Is that what did this ? A swarm of these things ? Yeah . I think that 's what happened to the electrician . No one was in the house . You got to get rid of those speakers on the dock . Nim wouldn 't do anything like ... What about the wildlife guy ? Nim wouldn 't attack anyone unless they hurt him . Well , maybe someone did . LAURA : We 're almost out of air . ( rich coughing ) ( CREAKlNG ) Georgie ? George . No , Rich . No , Rich , turn it off . Rich , turn it off , turn it off . Turn it off , Rich . You better come take a look at this . LAURA : It 's like some sort of birthing zone . There 's hundreds of them . All laying eggs . This is what Cirko saw coming . Population explosion . Sorry , Nim . So that 's where all the chip clips went . You know the tiger that bit Roy ? Siegfried and Roy ? Yeah , Roy tripped or something , right ? Yeah . But the tiger thought he 'd been hurt . So he picked him up , like a cub . He wasn 't trying to hurt him . He was protecting him . It crushed his trachea . You know the last words Roy said as they took him off ? No . " Don 't kill the cat . " ( LOW growling ) Nim . You 've grown . ( NlM growling ) We are looking at the new top of the food chain . ( CLANGlNG ) ( BOTH groaning ) No , leave it , leave it ! Huh ? If he attacks us maybe it can knock us free or something . Yeah , or swallow us whole ! Yeah , but , Rich , we 're already dead ! The light 's gonna draw them to us , okay ? Here , just ... ( CREATURE ROARS ) Here , bang . If it 'll set the life raft free . That 's enough ! Now , come on ! Bang it ! Bang it hard ! Come on ! Come and get us ! ( BOTH screaming ) rich : Hang on , hang on ! LAURA : Hit the ballast ! Hit the ballast , it 'll free the life raft ! We 're going up . We 're going up . We 're going up , Rich . We 're on our way up , Rich . Okay , all right , hang in there . You okay , Rich ? Come on . Stay with me . We 're going up ! Oh , my God ! Oh , God ! Just hang in there , Rich , okay ? Okay ? Just one more time , Rich . Hang on , okay ? I can 't open it ! You gotta turn it ! You gotta turn it ! I am turning it ! I can 't open it ! Why don 't you just kick it ? Kick the damn thing ! Kick it ! Kick it ! Come on , kick it ! We got it . Oh , my God ! Come on , I got you ! I got you ! I got you ! I can 't ! rich : Hang on ! Hang on ! ( THUDDlNG )

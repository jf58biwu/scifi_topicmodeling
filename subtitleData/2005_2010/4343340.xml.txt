 Previously on Heroes . There 's just a lot of change going on with me . Really ? Yeah . It 's like when I look back on my life , it just seems like it 's not my life I 'm looking back on . It 's a midlife crisis . That 's all this is . Pete , it 's me again . I 've left you three messages . You need to call me . Something 's happening to me , and I think you 're the only person who 's going to understand what it is . For years , I put my job ahead of my family , and I 'm eating cereal for dinner and a strange man is answering my wife 's phone . That 's no way to live . So , what 'd we win ? A compass ? A broken compass . You can never change the past . it 's bad . If you wanna change one thing , that 's all you do . What if I could make it so that Danko wasn 't interested in you anymore ? Why do you want to do this for me ? Maybe we 're both looking for redemption . I want my old life back . I go back to my apple martinis and overpaid lobbyists . Excuse me . Tracy ? Is that you ? Hello , Governor . I 'm back . Nathan . Mom ? What brings you to DC ? Are you cleaning out the garage ? Yes , as a matter of fact . Here . Come , look . Just what the doctor ordered , a trip down memory lane . Last we spoke , you said something about looking back on your life and it feeling like someone else 's . Well , Nathan , this is your life . Gee , Mom , you didn 't really have to do that . Yeah , I don 't recognize any of this stuff . Well , of course , you do . Come on . Pick something up . Ma , really , I ... Here . Used to be your favorite toy . Uncle Tim bought this for me when we took that trip up the coast . I was in the back seat of the car . That 's when you decided you wanted to be a fighter pilot . You remember ? Yeah . I remember it like it was yesterday . Literally . Is there something wrong , Nathan ? No . Everything 's fine . Come on . What happened to you ? I mean , it feels like you fell off the face of the Earth . It was family . It was a family crisis . It was complicated and dramatic , and it 's behind me . So , you 're back . I 'm back . And I 'm looking for work . Not anymore , you 're not . I can use you back in New York . That is , if you 're willing to come work for me . I 'd be a fool to tum it down . Terrific . So , what 's going on ? I could use your help to ease some legislation through the minefields . You know , cut a few corners , charm a few regulators . It 's right up your alley , Trace . Right , baby ? Not a problem , Governor . Have dinner with me . Tonight . We can discuss the particulars . So happy to have my Tiger Lady back . Peter ? Hey , Noah . You got a minute ? Sure . Come on in . I thought you wanted nothing to do with me . I need to show you something . That 's a very nice arm . No ... There was a tattoo . Right here . I noticed it last night ... A mystery tattoo ? No . It was a compass . Just like the one that you pulled out of the safe-deposit box . A mystery com pass tattoo ? I know where you 're going , Noah , and I 'm not seeing things . It was there . I thought you 'd help me ... I don 't know . What are we going to do , though , Peter ? Seriously ? Are we gonna go on the road in search for this speedy guy with the knives and uncover soma giant conspiracy ? Not particularly . You wanna get cut up again ? No . I don 't . That 's why I 'm telling you I 'm not up for it . That 's all . Got it . So , what am I doing here ? Sorry to bother you , Noah . No problem . Not at all . Anytime . Claire ? What are you doing here ? I had to ask your dad a question , just something to clear my head up , but we 're good . I gotta go . I got to be at work in 10 minutes . Ten minutes ? You live in New York City . New power ? Ask your father about it . Just a fishing expedition that didn 't amount to anything , and it 's over . Can I get you something to eat ? A bowl of cereal ? Val , before you put that in , the guy didn 't tell us he was diabetic . Pete , I left you three messages . I 'm so sorry , man . I 'm so sorry . I 've been slammed . Are you okay ? Yeah . I need to talk to you . Can it wait ? Five minutes . So , what 's up ? Whoa ! When did that start happening ? Couple of days ago . I 'm like a Swiss Army Knife of superpowers now . It 's a new power every day . I guess it runs in the family . Yeah . But there 's something else . What ? I 'm seeing things , Peter . Memories . Images . Memories , but they 're not my memories . Not exactly . I 'll touch something and ... It 's freaking me out . I 've read about this . It 's called psychometrics . Has something to do with seeing the history of an object . Where it 's been , what it 's experienced . So what I 'm seeing , it 's real ? Possibly . I don 't know . Why ? What are you seeing ? You remember Kelly Houston ? Kelly Houston . Before or after she ran away and broke your heart ? I don 't think she ran away , Pete . I really don 't . I touched my old baseball hat and I got a flood of images of her and me in a pool . I know how all this must sound . She was dead and there was blood everywhere . You think somebody killed her ? I don 't know . If what I 'm seeing is real , then yeah . What would you do ? I think you gotta find the truth . Go by the house . I mean , her mother still lives there , right ? Millie ? Yeah . Okay . You want me to go with you ? No . It 's my mess . I 'll clean it up . Tell me the truth , Claire . Why are you here ? You checking up on the old man ? No . Can 't a daughter just drop in on her father unannounced ? I worry about you . Since Mom is gone and the Company is not around , you just seem planless . You always have a plan . I 'm fine . That " fins " sounds very unconvincing to me . You 're not fine . You 're living off of cereal and Japanese take-out . Well , that is a good point . Tonight I ordered Italian . What about a job ? What about it ? Well , I know it 's a down economy and all , but I 'm sure there 's something you can do . Well , my particular skills aren 't really all that marketable . That is not true . You were middle-management of Primatech Paper for over 20 years . During which time , my skills consisted of lying to my family , breaking down doors , bagging and tagging ... On the plus side , you are a people person . Look . Oh ! Lumber salesman . Minimum five years ' sales experience . Ta-da ! You do know that was a cover , right ? I never actually sold anything . Yes , but you don 't have to admit to that . Okay . Say you 're at the interview , and I 'm the interviewer and you 're the interviewee . Are we really ... Tell me , Mr. Bennet , what do you think your greatest strength as a salesman is ? Well , if they won 't buy from me , I can always just shoot them . Nathan Petrelli . Millie . Hi . What are you doing here ? Reminiscing about Kelly . I happened to be in the neighborhood , thought I 'd stop by and say hello . That calls for a drink . What can I get you ? Nothing . I 'm fine , thanks . Sit down , Nathan . Thanks . Nobody ever talks to me about Kelly . Guess they figure it 's a sore subject . Truth is , I am made of sturdier stuff . So ? I was just going through some old things in my office and I started thinking about Kelly . Just got to wondering if you ... If I 'd heard from her ? Well , I wish I could say that I have . Wish I could say that all this time she 's been living in the south of France . That she became an artist . That she has a daughter named Fran√ßoise . Do you ever wonder if maybe she didn 't run away ? To be perfectly honest , there was a time when I thought maybe you knew more than you were saying . After all , we were away that weekend , but you were in town , Nathan . And I knew that you and Kelly had been seeing each other . I never told your mother , but I hired a private investigator . Turns out , you 're in the clear . Kelly , in fact , used her credit card to buy a one-way ticket to London Heathrow , where she claimed her checked baggage . And no one has seen or heard from her since . You think it 's possible something else might have happened , Millie ? Trust me . I 've been over this ad nauseum . Kelly was willful and spiteful and full of herself . Add to that , me not being the most attentive of mothers , no wonder she ran off . I 've got a hair , nail and body-sculpting thing and I don 't want to be late . I understand . So , you 'll show yourself out ? Of course . Here you go . Broke out the good stuff . I 've already had too much . And my mom would kill me if she found out . There 's no way she 'll find out . You 're right . You know , my folks won 't be back until Monday . Is that an invitation ? Do you want it to be ? I don 't know . You 've been drinking . I wouldn 't want to take advantage . Don 't be such a prude . You want it , Nathan ? Come and get it . Coma on , Nathan . Come and get it . You better give me that . Come and get it . Give me that . No . Whoa ! No ! You wanted to see me ? Millie called . Chardonnay . She said you came to her asking questions about Kelly . Do you have any idea what your trip down memory lane is doing to that poor woman ? Thank you . Kelly didn 't disappear . She died . I was there . What I want to know is why I can 't remember anything . How would I know ? Because every time there 's a secret buried some place I find you with a shovel behind your back . You should write Mother 's Day cards . I 'm gonna get to the bottom of this , one way or the other . So you can tell me or ... Fine . I took care of it . And you don 't need to know the details . You made sure I wouldn 't remember anything , didn 't you ? You were drunk and foolish . So , yes , I took care of it . All of it . I had the Haitian wipe your memory . I disposed of her body . I bought the plane ticket to London ... It was an accident , Mom . Well , it didn 't look like one , dear . So what would you have me do ? Her death would have ruined your life . I 'm just waiting for the part that makes any of this okay . I made a choice to protect my son . You want to vilify me for that , fine . I 've been vilified for so much less , but , please , Nathan , don 't destroy yourself over this . So , what ? You 're gonna have your old friend Millie go on believing that her daughter ran away because she was a bad mother ? Yes . Millie has made her peace with this . I suggest you do the same . I 'll be in touch . Did you forget something ? There 's something I need to tell you , Millie . And I 'm not sure how to do it . You all right , Nathan ? Look , I can 't tell you how I know this when I 'm not really sure I should . What are you talking about ? Just say it . Kelly didn 't run away . She died . And I was there . It was an accident . And it was my fault . She got on a plane . There 's no plane ticket . She died , Millie . And the whole thing was covered up by my family . What kind of twisted , pathetic game are you playing ? I 'm just trying to tell you the truth , for once . I think you should leave . Please . Go . I 'm sorry . So , you never answered the question . Greatest strength ? Greatest strength . Well , I would have to say that above all else , I am a company man . You won 't find anybody more dedicated to his job than me . See ? That 's perfect . What lumber company wouldn 't want to hire you ? Yep . I 'm a real people person . What 's the matter ? Oh . I don 't know . It 's just , you know , kind of sad when you look back on your life and you realize it hasn 't amounted to much . What are you talking about ? Your whole life has been about trying to help people . Has it ? Because all I see is pain . I shot them , cuffed them , locked them up , wiped their memories . But I don 't remember actually helping anybody . That 's not true . You 've helped plenty of people . Name one . Me . Life changes . We all change . Sometimes you have to remember who you were to figure out who you want to be . Why do I suddenly feel like you 're the parent and I 'm the kid ? We 'll take turns . Yeah . So , you don 't really want to sell lumber , huh ? Nope . Not at all . Hiro . Hiro . Fancy meeting you here . Am I that predictable ? You live upstairs . How are you ? Okay . So , what brings you to my neighborhood ? I got my old job back with Governor Maiden . Well , that was quick . Good for you . Let 's celebrate . I 'll buy you a tuna roll . Yeah . I 'm not really hungry . So , why are you here ? I don 't know . You got your life back , Tracy , and that 's what you wanted . Isn 't it ? It just feels like something 's missing . Something needs to change . Well , you got a job in government . That 's a good start . Please . Malden isn 't about helping people . Then quit . I can 't . Do you know how many people would kill for my position ? Life changes , Tracy . We have to change with it . Maybe you just can 't go home again . Maybe you have to remember who you were to figure out who you want to be . I gotta go . I have a dinner with Maiden and I can 't be late . Thanks for the advice , though . Anytime . Oh . I can 't tell you how great it is to have you back , Trace . I missed you . It 's nice to be missed . Cosmo still your drink ? Mmm-hmm . One Cosmo , please . Look at us . Just like old times . Kind of . This job , I want it to be more . I want to set agendas . Help people who can 't help themselves . So much for small talk . I want a job where I 'm making a real difference in people 's lives . Trace , you don 't have to work so hard to impress me . We both know what you bring to the table . Tell you what , why don 't we skip dinner ? Let 's go upstairs . Make each other happy . Just like old times . Will you excuse me for a moment ? Sure . Yeah . But don 't be long . Oh , my God . There you go . Is everything okay , baby ? No . No . Everything 's not okay . I don 't understand . I wouldn 't expect you to . Hello . Yes , I 'd like to speak with someone in the homicide division . Yeah . I 'll hold . I 've been looking for you . What 's the matter ? You are thinking about something . Is it the new people that Samuel 's bringing in to the family ? You think he 'd be bringing in more if Joseph was alive ? I don 't know . It was his brother and he has a right to his revenge . No matter what it means for the rest of us ? I 'll tell you what it means . I 'm the one who 's left to make all the decisions for this family . I 'm the one that decides which direction we travel . We were just talking , is all . Come with me . It 's time to find another . You know you can tell me anything , don 't you ? Of course . If anyone tells you they 're dissatisfied with me . If you 're dissatisfied ... I 'm not dissatisfied . Good . What are you doing ? Why are you showing him to me ? I show you what you need to see . Why would I need to see Bennet ? He retired . He 's no longer interested in us . He may have changed his mind . Nathan seemed very confused . Wanted to make sure I heard his side of the story . It was upsetting , to say the least . Well , Nathan has always been overly theatrical . You know , I 'm sure that 's why he 's drawn to the spotlight of politics . What exactly did he say ? I feel so silly telling you this . No , please , he 's my son . I want to know . He said that Kelly was dead . That he was with her when she died . I told him , " No . " She bought a ticket , got on a plane and never locked back . " Millie , I am so sorry that he bothered you with this . Nathan ... Nathan just hasn 't been himself lately . You know how much I 've always cared for Nathan . I apologize for his behavior . No one should have to go through that pain twice . I can honestly say , I don 't care anymore . I just hope Kelly 's happy . I think that 's about as close to closure as I 'm ever going to get . Would you excuse me just one second ? Hello ? Package is delivered . Wonderful . Thank you so much . Something important ? Not at all . Good . Where were we ? Closure . Of course . To closure . To closure .

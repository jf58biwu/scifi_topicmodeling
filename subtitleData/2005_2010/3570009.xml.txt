She 's got the telly working , that 's the first priority . Plenty to shift ! Plenty more boxes . Find the kettle , I 'm parched . - Maria ! - Coming ! Pass me that lamp , it 's fragile . The cutlery 's in the boot , go and fetch it . - Living room ? - No , kitchen , can 't you read ? Don 't go through the front , go round the side . I did say . Mind you , not bad . - Mum ! Stop fancying the removal men ! - They love it . Besides , they 're getting paid . Cutlery , go on ! Hiya . Put it by the window , thanks . Thank you , boys . Come on then . All done . Congratulations , our new home . Look at me , it 's nearly six , I 'd better be off . - Can 't you stay for tea ? - Ivan 's cooking me dinner . But you are going to love it , I promise . - I liked the old house . - Mum wanted the money . Now don 't start . This is a better area , that place was holding you back . - They were my friends . - You 'll get better friends ! You 'll settle in , don 't worry . And you . You still can 't make a cup of tea . Can you give me that cheque ? My cheque book is buried in a box . Post it . Tomorrow , if you could . - Sure . - Angel . Bye-bye ! Big kiss ! You and me , eh ? Come on . Bubble Shock . For maximum performance . No added sugar . No concentrate . Bubble Shock . Contains Bane ! For maximum performance . How would you know if you were going mad ? Ask your mother , she 's the expert . I 'll tell her you said that . What if you see something you know can 't be happening , only it is happening , only it can 't be ? I dunno , go ask them . - That 's our first visitors ! - If it 's Angelina Jolie , tell her I 'm not interested . Go on . - You moved in yesterday ? - Yeah . I saw you . I 'm Kelsey . Hiya . - I 'm Maria . - You got broadband ? - Yeah . - Brilliant ! You haven 't got music channels . What 's the point , if you haven 't got them ? - Dad says it costs . - Nag him . You 'll be dead in school , if you haven 't . - Do you want some of this ? - No , thanks , I don 't like it . I love it . Want to come into town ? I haven 't got any money . We 'll get the Bubble Shock Bus . It 's free . Get your stuff . What , a free bus ? To the Bubble Shock factory . You get free samples . Come on ! I want to show you Darren , he works in the bike shop . Dad , I 'm going out . You heading off without me ? We 're going into town . - Without a proper goodbye ? - Dad . I 'm so shamed for you . - Who 's your friend ? - This is Kelsey . Did they tell you about the people that used to live here ? - No . - They went mad . Ran away . Mum 's friend , Kath Pontin , lives there , said the bloke kept going on about seeing aliens . - From space ! - What sort of aliens ? Like it 's real ! Come on , we 're going to miss it . Hi . We moved in opposite , I 'm Maria Jackson . - Hello . - Hi ! Hello . Nice to meet you , I 'm Alan Jackson . I hope you won 't make much too noise . I work from home , I don 't like to be disturbed . - Okay , nice to be made welcome . - Sorry . Sarah Jane Smith . - See ya , then ! - Yeah . - Where are you going ? - Bubble Shock factory ! Free bus ! I 'm sure we 'll get on , it 's just me and Maria now . Making a new start . Bit of a divorce . Don 't worry , it 's sorted . There 's no shouting . What kind of work do you do ? Really ? Really , well . Must be fascinating . Nice to meet you too . You got my number . Don 't give it to anyone in Year Eight . That 's the mad woman . Always racing about . She 's a bit glamorous . What does she do ? Journalist or something . Kath Pontin says she never has anyone round . Never talks to anyone . Sakkib saw her by the station , she was talking to this crystal and it moved . What , like a monster or something ? Here it is ! Get on . All aboard for Bubble Shock . I don 't get how this Bubble Shock stuff works . I don 't care . It makes you feel wide-awake . It tastes fab . - It 's disgusting . - You 're one of the 2 % . Doesn 't work on 2 % of the people . Anyway , it 's organic . So that makes it all right , the magic word " organic " ? It 's natural . And that 's good . So there . Drink it , drink it . There it is . Bubble Shock ! Welcome to Bubble Shock . Any visitors must report to central processing . Access beyond the visitor area is forbidden . I knew it . Welcome to the Bubble Shock Experience . Step through the archway . Just a security scan . One at a time . Thank you . Security scan in a pop factory ? People want to steal the recipe ! Come on , it doesn 't hurt . First lot going through . Transmitting data to the Archetype , in five , four , three , two , one , and transmit . Is it working ? Oh , yes . He 's almost fully mature . I would even say ... perfect . Mother will be pleased . Oops . Mrs Wormwood ? We have an intruder . Dispose of them . She says her name is Sarah Jane Smith . Does she indeed ? Bring her to my office . Make her welcome . This should be fun . Ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls , welcome to Bubble Shock ! - It 's huge . - I 've seen it loads of times . A quick reminder , turn off your mobile phones . All of you . We have extremely sensitive equipment . The signals can interfere with the machinery . What 's a mobile going to do , make the bubbles go flat ? That 's enough lip at the back , just do it . - That 's rude . - I don 't care , he 's a total muffin . Everyone , this is the main production area ! Before we go any further , I 'd like to offer you more samples . Help yourselves . Bubble Shock revitalises your taste buds and gives you energy morning , noon and night . Only Bubble Shock contains Bane , etcetera . That 's it , keep moving , thank you . Don 't touch anything , how many times ? Oi . - No Bubble Shock ? - No , ta . I 'm one of the 2 % with the wrong taste buds . Don 't worry , we 're working on it . Soon we 'll have everyone drinking Bubble Shock . - The whole world . - I 'd rather have a cup of tea . Thank you . That 's very kind . Think of yourself as our guest . I wasn 't breaking in , I was trying to reach someone in charge . I phoned a hundred times , no one would talk to me . I 've seen the list , phone calls , emails . Miss Sarah Jane Smith makes her presence felt . - Do you mind if I take notes ? - Not at all . Since you 've been so bold , make this an official interview . And it 's Mrs Wormwood ? That 's correct . That 's in the Bible , Wormwood . The Book of Revelations . At the end of the world , it describes a star falling to Earth and poisoning the waters . - A star called Wormwood . - Fascinating . Shall we move on to business ? I 've got contacts in the City . They said this company dropped in from nowhere . Normally , it takes years of tests to get approval from the EU to market a new foodstuff . You got it in two weeks . - All we 're doing is satisfying a need . - Which is ? The people are hungry , Miss Smith . For new food , new drinks , new tastes . All the Western world does is eat . All day , every day , eating . They gorge and feast and chew and bite , everything sweet and hot and cold and sticky food and drink , just food and drink , that 's the human race . - They devour . Who are we to deny them ? - So you invented Bane ? The Bane in Bubble Shock isn 't new , Miss Smith . No , it 's very , very old . Come and see . For all the hype , Bane is completely natural . - 100 % organic . - Yes , but organic what ? Don 't be silly . I can hardly give away our recipe . I checked with some scientists . Your social circle sounds fascinating . They tried to analyse Bubble Shock . What 's the point of analysis ? It 's all chemicals and sweeteners and E-numbers . The test of a drink is in the tasting . - Have you tried it ? - Oh , no . Definitely not . But you must . Lesley ! Oh , no , really , thanks , I 'm fine . No , no , no , no . But I insist ! A good journalist should submit to the complete experience . Drink Bubble Shock , Miss Smith . Drink deep . Bane has received ringing endorsements . We 're not supposed to advertise , but we make an exception for this ! You 've got to try Bubble Shock , it 's delicious ! Drink it ! Mrs Wormwood . I 'd rather die . Well , we can 't have that . Can we ? Scientists said that Bane behaves oddly when they test it . As if it 's resisting analysis . And nothing could do that . At least nothing on Earth . What are you suggesting , Miss Smith ? That Bane originated in outer space ? Of course not . That would be ridiculous . Wouldn 't it though ? The water and fruit juice ends up here , where Bane is added . It 's bottled , quality-controlled , packed up , ready to be distributed all over the British Isles . We 'll be done in 20 minutes . I 'll call Suki , she can meet us in WHSmith 's . - You can 't use your phone . - What are you , a Girl Guide ? - They 'll take it off you . - He 's not going to see . Suki 's dead rich ! Go ahead and print your story . But consider your career . Are you going to expose this as some kind of alien plot ? You 'll be considered insane . I don 't care what people think of me . Never have . I just want to find the truth . But at such a cost . I take it you 're single ? - Yes , I am . - No children ? - No . - Such a wasted life . Miss Smith is leaving . Lesley will show you out . By the way , what planet do you come from ? Nice try . Lesley . Kill her . Blimey . Don 't put this on the tour , do they ? Hiya , Suki . I 'm sorry . We have some kind of emergency . That 's it , keep moving , please , thank you . Get them out . Get everyone out ! Kelsey . Kelsey ? What is it ? What 's happening ? - Mrs Wormwood . She escaped . - Sarah Jane Smith ! Kelsey ? Find that woman , and this time , kill her properly ! Kelsey ? - What have you done ? - Get that thing away from me ! She is not a thing ! You are the thing ! She is my mother , the mother of us all ! - Sir ! - Well , turn it off ! That 's my phone ! There 's nothing to be scared of , Mother . Our precious Bane Mother . Kelsey ? You there ? Close off the exits . Maintain position . Section 17 report ! - Um . Hello . - Um . Hello . - Who are you ? - Who are you ? - I 'm lost . - I 'm lost . I 'll turn off vat number 4 . Shroud yourself , Mother . We will destroy the source . Mrs Wormwood . Situation under control . I don 't think so . The Archetype has escaped . Find him ! For the Bane Mother 's sake , turn off these alarms ! Find the device . B squad , C squad . I 'm not with them . I can help you ! Got to find a place to hide . Yes ! Come on ! We 'll be safe in here for a bit . One place men never go . Sorry for dragging you into the ladies . Why do men never go to the ladies ? - What are you doing here ? - I could ask you the same ! Who 's he ? - Have you searched everywhere ? - It must have left . Impossible ! There are still humans here . I can smell them . And one particular person , still alive . What have they done to you ? - I knew I had to get away . - That goes for all of us . - Did you search in there ? - It 's for their females only . We are males , their culture says we must never go in . You idiot . - Where does that lead ? - Visitors ' car park . - Only a child could get through . - Or a slender female . Come on . This way . Quickly , seal the gates . Move , get in ! My friend 's in there . I only just met her , but I can 't leave her . Maybe she was on the bus . - Now get in . - I can 't ! - What 's that thing ? - Sonic lipstick . Now get in ! - Search the perimeter . - Move ! Retrieve the Archetype . She 's taken the Archetype . Now we can have even more fun . Oh , even more . Now then . Let 's find out what you know , little girl . Who is he ? What was he doing there ? What were they doing ? Leave it . Go home , Maria , I can handle things now . There 's something going on ! I saw you last night ! - What did you say ? - She said she saw you last night . With that thing in your garden . That alien . Now listen to me , Maria . My life is dangerous . Rule one , I don 't put anyone in danger . Especially not a kid . I 'm not a kid ! Go back home . Watch telly , do whatever you do . Live your life as normal . Forget any of this happened . Have you got that ? Stay away from me , for your own sake ! Hey , I 've worked out the oven , it was on a timer . Maria ? I want compensation for that phone . That was brand new ! And he is a prize mentalist . He 's got this big puppet living in his roof . - He thinks it 's his mum . - Puppet ? She means Mother . Yeah ? Then you should go on Jeremy Kyle . I can 't understand a word she says . She 's all noise and ignorance . Whereas Miss Smith seems familiar with the concept of alien life . Far too familiar . If we scan her ... An average human , except ... - What is it ? - Residual artron energy . - And what 's that ? - Background radiation . Result of travels through the space-time vortex . A while ago , but it 's still there . - A time-space traveller ? - So it seems . - We need to find her . - She lives on Bannerman Road . - Pardon ? - Banner-man Road . She 's as loony as you lot . We must retrieve the Archetype and kill this Smith woman . I 've been aching to kill one since we arrived . This one has information . We could use her . You can let me go , otherwise I 'm phoning the police , and ChildLine ! I 'm going to turn off my image translator . Try not to scream . I never scream . Someone said there 's a miserable girl who needs a cup of tea . I couldn 't find one so you 'll have to do . - Thanks . - What is it , then ? I know . New house . New school , next week . Everything must seem so weird . - You 're telling me . - If there 's anything wrong , you can tell me . You know that . You can tell me anything . Oh ! It felt so good to be myself . These clumsy human oxen . The girl 's unconscious . I 'm surprised you didn 't kill her . These miniature versions have parents . Parents ask questions . - What did we learn ? - The thoughts of a child are chaos . Late homework . Is she fat ? Will she ever be kissed ? She worships something called the Holy Oak . No , Hollyoaks . She wishes she was younger , she wishes she was older . This world scares her so very much . - Sarah Jane Smith ? - She knows her . Bannerman Road . Number 13 . Yes ! She lives alone . No support , no defences . - Then I can attack ! - Oh , yes . Have some fun . And I filleted the memories . This one will remember nothing . Oh . Right . Hiya . I am so ashamed . I 'm asleep in your office . We 've looked after you . And don 't worry , Davey can take you home . Off you go , Davey . Bannerman Road . Enjoy . But you must have a name . If I 'm Sarah Jane , then you 're ... All I know is I had to run . But you can talk , someone must have taught you that . - Who was it ? - Everyone . What does that mean , everyone ? I am everyone . And then I had to run . The girl came , Maria , and then you . Well , think back . Before you ran , what can you remember ? I was born running . But you must have a home . - Is this your home ? - Yes , it is . - Can I live here ? - No , I don 't think so . Sorry . Help yourself . - Is this food ? - Food and drink . Which is which ? - Sarah Jane ? - Who 's that ? - No one . - There was a voice . No , there wasn 't . - Sarah Jane ? - Not now ! - I thought you lived alone . - I do . Whatever happens , you 're not to go upstairs . It 's private . You don 't ever go upstairs , unless I say so . - You don 't trust me ? - I don 't even know you . Hold on . Now don 't be afraid . Not alien . A normal , healthy lad . Human , ageing rate normal , but ... This says you were born 360 years ago . No . You were born 360 minutes ago . Is that good or bad ? Bannerman Road . Off you go . I don 't have to be home till six . We could go for a burger . Get out . And don 't forget ... Drink Bubble Shock . Here comes trouble . - Kelsey ! - Thanks for abandoning me ! Some friend you are ! I 'm making a snack . Do you want beans on toast ? - Too many carbohydrates . - You can starve . The alarms went off , I was running round , looking for you . He 's all right , your dad . A bit fit . Shut up ! Where 'd you get to , Kelsey ? The factory . What happened ? - You can read ? - I can now . - You just learnt ? - It 's easy . Letters and words . Forgive me , but if you don 't mind , lift up your top so I can see your stomach . - No belly button . - Is that good or bad ? Everyone who 's born has got a belly button . - Why not me ? - Sorry , but I don 't think you were born . I think you were grown . I was mortified to wake up in her office . - They drove me home . - Who did ? - The muffin . - The man from the tour ? He 's here ? Yeah , what about it ? - Dad , I 'm going out ! - Eh ? What ? Sarah Jane ! Open up ! It 's me , it 's Maria ! You are completely shaming me ! I told you , leave me alone . It 's the man from the factory , he 's here . Inside ! Get in ! What is it ? What is that thing ? - Hello , Maria . Hello , Screaming Girl . - There 's a great big alien out there ! What is it ? Get upstairs ! - We 're not allowed . - I 'm allowing you . Go ! - What is that thing ? - Shut up and move ! All of you , run ! Fast as you can . He 's coming up the stairs . We 're gonna die ! What is that thing ? He 's coming . Wait here . - What 's up there ? - You can 't go up . I 'll be 10 seconds . You will die ! You and the squealing pigs . This is not happening . This is so not happening . But that contradicts the facts . First the children and then you , old woman . Hey ! Less of the old . - It 's the muffin ! - That is a muffin ? Pity . That was the last one . - What 's going on ? - Maria , don 't get involved . It 's a little bit too late for that . Thanks . You saved our lives . I suppose I did . Oh , my flipping heck . - Don 't go up there ! Who said you could come up here ? Don 't touch anything ! - These things , are they alien ? - Some of them . - Where did you get them ? - You 've seen too much now . It 's not as if anyone 's going to believe you . Aliens are falling to Earth all the time . It 's not just those stories you hear on the news . Some creatures have got lost , like the one you saw me sending home last night . Some crash-land , and some want to invade . - You still believe me ? - Yes . - Really ? How come ? - ' Cause you 're bonkers , but I don 't think you 're a liar . No , except about the bonkers bit . - This place is beautiful . - Thank you . - Not bad yourself . - What does that mean ? - He 's mine . - Is that good or bad ? That 's bad . It 's just you , though ? On your own ? The government knows all about aliens . There are secret organisations dedicated to finding them , but they tend to go in guns blazing . I think there 's a better way of doing it . But how did you get started ? I met this man . A very special man . Called the Doctor . Years ago , we travelled together . - In space ? - Space and time . And then it came to an end . Suddenly I was back to a normal life , electric bills , burst pipes , bus tickets and rain . - She is completely loop-the-loop . - There ? Do you see ? Who can I talk to about it ? For years I tried to forget . And then I met him again , the Doctor . We 'd both changed , but it 's funny , because we were still both the same . I learnt I could carry on here on Earth , doing what we always did . That 's when I started this . I began again . And the Bubble Shock factory - it 's run by aliens . Everyone 's an alien . You , me , the Pope , James Blunt . I can believe that one . You saw it ! That alien creature ! I saw a muffin in a suit ! Like in the films , it 's pretend ! - He 's circled back ! - Another invasion , obviously . Little green men ! A scientific project in Switzerland created their own black hole . If it gets free , the Earth would be swallowed up . - So K9 's sealing it off . Greetings , mistress . - K9 ? - He 's my friend . K9 as in canine ? Oh , that is so lame . He 's been in there for a year and a half , plugging the distortion , and every so often he passes my way . Your best friend 's a metal dog stuck in a black hole ? I know . How are you , K9 ? How do you feel ? Misunderstanding of the functional nature of this unit . I do not feel . All circuits are functioning at full capacity . - Can you ever come out , K9 ? - This is Maria . Greetings , mistress . I cannot emerge until this breach is sealed . - How long will that take ? - I cannot estimate the duration . - What does he eat , nuts and bolts ? - The small female is hostile . Don 't listen to her . Regret I must transfer co-ordinates . Bye-bye , K9 . Good dog . Affection noted , mistress . - How long 's he gone for ? - I don 't know . I miss him . Don 't you laugh , Kelsey Hooper . But he was my dog , my daft little metal dog . And now , I 'm on my own . You know the penalty . Forgive me . But she had weapons . Terrible weapons . A hunter that loses his prey is unfit to serve the Bane Mother . - I 'll go back . I 'll kill her . - I can manage that on my own . Mother eats the children that fail her . You will become food . What 's this , then ? It 's a communicator . A gift from the person you saw last night . She said if I ever needed help , I could use it to call her . - Then let 's call her . - She meant help with poetry . She was a Star Poet from Arcateen 5 . That 's not much use . Unless you want to rhyme " trouble " with " double " . Let me see . Careful . He knows nothing about the world . Everything 's new to him . I think he 's an experiment , like , those aliens created him . - He 's their child . - He 's still human . If you don 't mind . I don 't like people going through my things . - That device on your wrist detects alien life ? - That 's right . - Then what is it detecting now ? - How do you mean ? - There might be one of those things out there ! - No , wait a minute . - What ? - Kelsey ! You 're an alien ! - Oh , you wish ! - No , it 's not her . That 's mine ! It 's the drink . It 's that ingredient Bane . - Yeah , it 's organic . - More than that . It 's alive . Species identified : Bane . It 's not just an ingredient , it 's an alien ! This is the secretion of ... I need glasses . A Bane Mother . There 's a piece of living Bane inside every bottle of Bubble Shock . I 've been drinking that stuff . And it 's alien ? - I thought you didn 't believe in aliens . - Shut up . I 've got things from outer space in my stomach ! - What you gonna do about it ? - It 's not my fault . You 've got all this stuff , and you sit here , yapping on all day about planets and monsters , what good is that ? - Why don 't you do something ? - All right , Kelsey . Just you watch . - Mr Smith . I need you ! - Yes , Sarah Jane ? - Mr Smith 's a computer . - An alien computer . Mr Smith , I want a direct visual link to Mrs Wormwood at the Bane factory . - Can you get coordinates ? - Accessing . You can just phone her up ? Mr Smith can hack into anything . - Why do you want to talk to them ? - I want to be fair . ... 7689014658757562987032105 dash 5 . - That 's like their phone number . - Visual link connecting . - Mrs Wormwood . - Very clever . - Thanks for the assassination attempts . - My pleasure . The next one will involve harpoons . I know who you are and what you are . Bane . Now leave this planet ! - Are you declaring war ? - Mrs Wormwood , the universe is huge . And Earth is so small . You don 't need to do this . I 'm asking you , as one species to another , just leave this world . - Leave us in peace . Please . - And if I don 't ? Then ... I 'll have to do something . Very well . In the language of your young ones , bring it on . Now , that didn 't go well . - How 're you gonna stop them ? - You tell me . What ? You haven 't got a plan ? Nothing ? No . The people I fight have plans and weapons , but I don 't . It 's what makes me different . Mother , events have escalated . We must declare war on mankind . Open your mind , Mother . You must convert the humans containing Bane . They will convert the rest ! Let this become ... Bane World ! Kelsey Hooper ! Look ! - Help me . - Oh , my God . It 's beginning . Kelsey , fight it ! - Drink it . - The Bane are taking people over . Out ! Quickly ! Out ! Drink it , drink it , drink it , drink it . - I 've got to get to the factory . - I 'll come . You are staying here ! Dad ! Stay indoors , there 's all this stuff happening . - Drink it . - Dad . No , Dad . Mother stirs ! Those who have not taken Bane must be converted ! Drink it . Dad , listen . It 's not you , it 's the drink , it 's the Bane . Drink it , drink it . We can 't help them . The only thing we can do is get to the factory . - Now get in the car ! - Drink it , drink it , drink it . - This is bad , yes ? - What are we gonna do ? There are two types of people in the world . People who panic . And then there 's us . Got that ? Got it . Drink it . Drink it . Mother welcomes her new children . Come to us , newborn Bane . Come to us ! - I 'm going inside . You stay here . - No way ! Drink it . - They 've got a deadlock seal ! - What does that mean ? - We can 't get in ! - Sarah Jane ! Drink it . Drink it . We can 't go back and we can 't get in . What do we do ? No . There 's got to be a way of getting in . There must be something . What do I do ? Oh , come on , Doctor , help me . Come on ! Think ! Drink it . Drink it . Drink it . Yes ! Humans who don 't submit will be reduced to liquid . Then Bane will drink them , and ... What 's that noise ? - Not too late for the party ? - Miss Smith . - I warned you . Leave this planet ! - Have you met my mother ? - Leave her alone ! - I told you to stay on board . Too late for that ! You 've brought us the Archetype . He is a living , thinking human being . And you created him . What for ? He 's an assembly of thousands of humans . A montage , you might say , a collage . On every tour of the factory , we 'd scan the guests , all 10,000 of them . Then we fed every strength , and every weakness into him . The Archetype . - I am everyone . - But why ? The 2 % that wouldn 't touch Bane . The Archetype could tell us how to modify our product . But since we 've advanced our plans , he is no longer needed . No , no . He 's only a boy . I 'm begging you , let him go . Oh , that 's so sweet . But he 's dying , and soon you will join him , like all our enemies . Our slave control is activated around the world . The time of man is over . The time of Bane is come ! Drink it . Drink it . Drink it . Drink it . You 've failed , Miss Smith . This is where your lonely life has led you . Except she 's not on her own . She 's got me . And I 've got this . The device is tiny . Now you 've angered the Bane Mother . Do you really think that 's wise ? - I told you to stay away . - Know what ? I 'm still glad I didn 't . Mother , descend ! And consume them ! - You forgot this . - What is that ? - A signal device from another world . - What of it ? Like a mobile phone . Only to call across the stars , a million times more powerful . - You don 't know our frequency . - Mr Smith said it out loud . - That was dozens of numbers . - I remember them . You gave me the memory of 10,000 humans . Stop him ! ... 757562987032105 dash 5 . Calling the Bane ! The Bane Mother ! You 're killing her ! Archetype ! I order you to stop ! But you made him human , he 's ours ! Maria ! Give me a hand . Come on . Until the next time ... Miss Smith . Did we stop them ? - Are you all right ? - Their control has gone and I 'm free . - That 's good . - Oh , yes , that 's good ! I would be dead without you . We all would . You 're amazing ! The pair of you ! Amazing ! - This is happiness , yes ? - Oh , yes ! - We did it ! - We did it ! We did it ! The government has refused to comment , but Bubble Shock has been withdrawn from our shelves and the mass hysteria of this afternoon is being put down to a chemical imbalance of the brain ... Dad ! Whoa ! Hey ! - What 's brought this on ? - I thought I 'd lost you . I had a bit of a turn . It 's all over the news . Chemicals escaped from that factory and gave everyone hallucinations . - Oh , hello . - Hello . Just checking everything 's all right . - That 's very neighbourly . - Sorry about before . Welcome to the neighbourhood . It 's been eventful . Is it always like this ? No , this is a quiet day . - And who 's this ? - This ... is ... I suppose ... This is my son . My adopted son . - Hello . - And what 's your name ? - I don 't have one . - Sorry , it 's an old family joke . - He 's called ... - Look at you , leaving your front door open ! Did you hear about the chemicals ? Oh , it was a nightmare . I had Ivan chasing me , saying , " Drink it " . I told him to get off , but he wasn 't having it . Haven 't you unpacked yet ? I did say , the longer things stay in boxes , the less it feels like a home . - And you are ? - Sarah Jane Smith . I 'm from over the road . This is my mother . - What 's he wearing ? - The clothes I was born in . Right . Thank you very much , but I 've had a bit of a trauma . - Family time . Thanks for calling in . - Okay , we 'll be off . - This woman is rude . - Yes . Definitely going . Come on . You don 't have to . Invite the neighbours round , you 'll never get rid of them . Next thing , it 's holidays together . That is a recipe for disaster . No offence , nice to meet you , Sarah Lou . He was chasing me round the bedroom with a bottle of pop . Next thing you know , her-next-door 's doing the same thing . Oh ! While I 'm here , I 'll have that cheque . Can 't you give it a week ? I had to pay the removal men . Well , you should 've planned ! That 's Alan , no plans . But Ivan 's booked this villa . It 's gorgeous , but we 've got to pay the deposit so ... Cheers . And it 's normal pop . Hooray for normal pop . How 's your friend , Kelsey ? She 's back-tracking , saying it was all hallucinations . - No such thing as aliens . - But we know better . Oh , that 's more like it ! - This is good ? - Yup ! How are you gonna adopt him , then ? You need forms and things . Who are you gonna say his real mum is ? The Bane Mother ? Mr Smith 's sorted that . Officially done and dusted . - All he needs now is a name . - You can choose your own . - I like yours . Maria . - Maybe not . - How about Jack ? Josh ? Nathan ? - Harry ? Alistair ? Luke ? - I like Luke . - I like Luke . If you like Luke , I like Luke . The name I was going to choose if ever I had kids . - Except it never happened . - But now it has . - Luke Smith . You 're a mum ! - I am . I never asked , have you got a boyfriend , or ... Oh , there was only ever one man for me . And after him , nothing compared . When I was your age , I used to think , " When I 'm grown up , " I 'll know what I want . " But you never really know what you want , you never feel grown up or sort it all out . So I thought , I can handle life on my own . But after today , I don 't want to . What 's that ? It 's just a plane . - That 's a flying machine , right ? - Perhaps it 's a spaceship . I saw amazing things , out there in space . But there 's strangeness wherever you turn . Life on Earth can be an adventure , too . You just need to know where to look .

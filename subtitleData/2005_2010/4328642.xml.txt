 I have ... Alzheimer 's . I found this in your desk . " To Dad . " " I am taking Mom someplace better . " " So you can never make her feel bad again . " Jesus Christ ! You 're the head guy on that panel . Advised the government . Told them that genetically modified fish were safe for human consumption . That 's my boy , Dr. Sandstrom . One day he 's running in the yard . Next day , his whole body 's paralyzed . Basically we found a group of kids with muscle development problems . We 're looking into their family histories ... DNA samples . Bob , are you saying that something was dumped there ? It wasn 't an accident . An accident implies I made a mistake , and I did not make a mistake . I need you to sign these forms that NorBAC is not legally responsible . Tell you what , I 'll sign those papers as soon as you start doing your job around here . - And what is that supposed to mean ? - That means : figure out why things are going missing . Find out who 's fucking around with my lab equipment . A National Guard unit in Canton , Ohio was doing a routine endurance course . These are troops ramping up for Iraq . Excellent condition . They all came down with the same symptoms . Headaches , flu-like symptom , blurred vision , severe muscle pain . And then there was the psychosis . Sleepiness , right ? - Okay . - Sleepiness into coma . - Encephalitis Lethargica ? - Highly contagious , over 5 million people got it , no one ever figured it out . Yes , Sir . I 'll put a note on his desk . Connor McGuinn 's office . I 'm sorry , he 's in a meeting . I 'll make sure he gets the message . Thank you for holding . I 'm sorry , Captain McGuinn is out of the office . Of course . Connor McGuinn 's office . Yes , Ms. Morrison , I 'll put you right through . Connor McGuinn 's office . ... then you 're sure it 's Encephalitis Lethargica ? Jill and I went back to Ohio yesterday to double check the symptomology . All the Guardsmen have it : fever . You know , they can barely stay awake . Hallucinations . It 's progressing exactly like Lethargica . And the prognosis ? Everything I 've read , anything from psychosis to death . Two million people died during the last outbreak in the 20 's . So , we 're looking at a highly contagious virus ? Depends on the strain . Which we haven 't figured out yet . Connor , if there is another outbreak , it could kill millions again . Well , how did we stop it back in the twenties ? We didn 't . We got lucky . Except for a few isolated cases , it just vectored out and disappeared . And now it just suddenly comes back ? It 's a retrovirus ! It 's something we all have sleeping in our DNA . Is it possible ... Could Al-Qaeda have the means to wake it up ? There 's a lot of dirty scientists out there who 'd be willing to make a few extra bucks to help them out . Captain , Dr. Henshaw is on " two " . Thank you . Doctor , I 'm conferencing you with David Sandstrom and Caroline Morrison . Good . Good . Dr. Sandstrom , can you hear me ? Yeah , fine . How 'd the Guardsmen react to the Levodopa ? Good idea you had there , Doctor , but no ... - No effect . - Not at all ? We even pushed the dosage to the limit . Levodopa should have gone right to the symptoms . Then you could be wrong ? Maybe we 're not dealing with Lethargica . - We need you right now . - You know what , Doctor ? I 've got to go . No , it 's gotta be Lethargica . Maybe we 're looking at a different strain , - or maybe it 's been altered to resist Levodopa . - Altered ? - You mean weaponized ? - It 'd make the perfect weapon . Something we 've ignored for the better part of a century . Something we haven 't got a clue how to fight . 2.12 - Lethargica Good morning . I 'll take this . From the Sick Kids Hospital . What did you order ? One headache , supersized . Is that the DNA for the National Guard ? No . For the Newfoundland families . I thought we were finished with that . Apparently not . David , wait . - What ? - What do you want to do ? Same thing we always do . Roll up our sleeves and dig in . - Hi , Bob . - Hi , Jill . Where were you ? Honey I 'm kind of exhausted . I overslept . What are you doing ? David and Caroline have been on the phone with Cpt . McGuinn all morning . So do you think it 's Encephalitis Lethargica ? I don 't know . I guess it could be . Dr. Constantin von Economo was the first to identify it . Encephalitis Lethargica . In 1916 . Okay . Headache , nausea , fever were followed , often the very next day , by chronic fatigue . There were similar reports before that . In Lisbon in 1521 , in Italy in 1561 , - and in Germany in 1605 . - Really ? I didn 't know that . So is this the same thing , or a variant ? - Who knows ? - Hey ! David wants to see you two in the conference room , now . Thanks , Wes . Hey , you guys . Check this out . David was right about the GMO fish . Look . Mayko , this meeting is about the Guardsmen in Ohio . This 'll just take a sec , Wes . So these arrays , they 're all the same as Earl Jordan 's son . The genetic inversions . The parents are all carriers of the anomaly ... Look at this . This person was born in 1999 . Born 1948 . Born 2001 . 1939 . So , these genetic anomalies have been around long before GMO fish . So , the fish couldn 't have caused the genetic mutation . No . And the nuclear rods were dumped in , what , 1950 's ? So the radiation couldn 't have caused any damage either . I 'd suggest you put this away for now . Come on , Wes . Caroline knows we 're not just- - I believe this meeting his called : The Ohio virus . Okay . Everybody up to speed on the Guardsmen ? Yes , I briefed them : symptoms , treatment . - Levodopa didn 't work . - Oh . We 've got medical histories , backgrounds . Okay , representative difference analysis PCRs right away . Let 's find out what this virus is first . I have the infected blood from the Guardsmen at my station . - Get uninfected blood from volunteers in the lab . - Uninfected ? Why ? Compare the two . Healthy and unhealthy DNA . It 'll help us find out what 's bad : the disease-causing organism . So , I guess we pool the Guardsmen blood , run a PCR and see what comes up virus . I want to do individual tests . One PCR per vial . David , if we pool it and run one single PCR it 'll be faster . - Faster is good . - Yeah , but it 's not as accurate . There may be a different viral load in each soldier . David 's right . We would run the risk of diluting viruses . So . One reaction per vial . - You 're a horrible man . - Thank you . Let 's get the blood flowing . This is on the back burner , Caroline . We 're just giving it a little stir . Okay , so the kids in Newfoundland , this is their genetic family history . Black circles are female carriers . Black squares are male carriers . You traced the disease all the way back to the same mom and dad ? Gail and Declan Perry . They emigrated from Ireland in 1812 . One of them must have been a silent carrier . It 's a classic recessive trait . - Just like blue eyes . - Yeah . Yeah . Both your parents have to give you the blue gene - if you 're going to have blue eyes . - I talked to a couple of local historians . And as far as we can tell , the Perry family had twelve healthy kids But some of them had to have been carriers . And then they moved out all around the Burin Peninsula . And they spread this recessive gene all over the place like a silent time bomb . Generations later , people don 't know that they 're related . Two silent carriers marry . And there 's a one in four chance that the illness genes meet up and make their child sick . So all the sick kids have the same great-great-great-grandparents ? Hmm , hmm . And remind me , who was it who said that this genetic anomaly had nothing to do with radiation or genetically modified fish ? Yeah , go pat yourself on the ass for me . Or actually , maybe you should do that after you tell the families what 's going on . Mr. Sandstrom . Hang on a sec . What ? Yes . Oh ... Should I come over ? No , no , no . Thank you for calling . Right . Good work , Mayko . Hello ? What ? Do you speak English ? Oh , good , thank you . Listen , could you connect me to the Norwegian Institute of Biological Sciences , please ? Matias , is that you ? David Sandstrom . I 'm good , thanks , how are you ? Good . Listen . Encephalitis Lethargica . Yeah , that 's right . The bodies from the Spitsbergen dig ? I 'm writing a follow up paper on the Spanish Flu outbreak in Denver we had over here last year . It 's on ... comparative symptomology and misdiagnosis . Listen , is there any way I can maybe get a tissue sample ? Fantastic . Thanks , Matias . No , no , Caroline ... It 's not ... No it 's ... No , my ... my father . He wandered away from the nursing home and they don 't know where he is , and I can 't ... Yes . So , it 's kind of ... Yeah . No , no , no . See , if ... If we can isolate the retrovirus in the Guardsmen 's blood , we can compare it to a tissue sample from a frozen coalminer who died of Lethargica in 1928 . That 's ri ... I 've already ordered it . Well , just ... Have them keep working on it . Vial by vial , okay ? Oh ! I gotta go . I gotta go ! Hey Dad . You forget your way home ? Why would I want to remember ? Those old people drive me nuts . Come on . I 'll take you back . I 'll stay , thanks . Dad , it 's pouring out . I got a coat on . Would you give them a call and tell them I 'm out here enjoying the beautiful weather and I 'll come back when I 'm ready to lie down and die . Which is not today . All right , well ... I guess I 'll just , you know , hang out here with you for a while and ... Fine . You have things to do ... Take me back to the hell hole . - What do we got ? - Well , the doctors in Ohio are not giving us any encouraging news . Three more soldiers on life support . Oh , shit . You finished the PCR ? We got a lot of bacterial and megaloviral DNA . Nothing that would cause the symptoms the Guardsmen have . - But something strange is going on . - And that is ? Well , we keep getting hits on the same piece of DNA . It looks harmless , but all the Guardsmen , their bodies are producing the same obscure DNA fragment over and over again . - Sequence it . - I 'll get right on it . Caroline ? McGuinn 's holding on line six . Thanks . Hey , Connor . We 're working our tails off here . The Guardsmen , they 're getting better . What ? I mean ... That 's fantastic ! We have some researchers at Fort Egan to thank . They said they sequenced the virus and matched it to Encephalitis Lethargica . So , David 's theory was right . Lethargica is back . It would appear . Anyway , then , they dove into the army 's arsenal of drugs , worked ' round the clock and developed a cure . Wow , that 's fantastic news . Have you connected it to Al-Qaeda ? Homeland Security is on it , but the bottom line is , if anyone else gets infected , - we 've got it covered . - Right . Please pass on my thanks to David and the rest of your team . - They worked hard on this . - Thanks , Connor . They found a cure ? Already ? How the hell did they do that ? Well , I 'm sure they had a hundred scientists working on it , right ? Caroline , if I had a thousand scientists in a thousand labs , working around the clock it 'd still be pretty amazing . - It is amazing , isn 't it ? - Yeah . It 's more like bullshit . It took nine years to come up with a drug that had any kind of effect at all on HIV . And these guys find a cure for an unknown , - unresearched killer in 48 hours ? - Something 's going on . Yeah , the government 's fucking around . Again . They did it with LSD , they did it with mustard gas . They 're trying shit out on their own soldiers . Okay , how do we prove it ? - Get the sequence of viral RNA . - I 'll try . Oh , and get the names of the guys who worked on the cure . I mean , if they 're that good , maybe they should be working for NorBAC . - Good night . - Good night . - So they are getting better ? - It 's amazing . Whatever we injected them with worked like a charm . Wait a minute . You don 't know what you treated them with ? They gave me a vial of something called RV-721 . Then they gave me orders to inject it into all the Guardsmen . - They ordered you . - Yeah , I know . It reeks of human experimentation . That 's why I kept a sample of it . You 've got the cure ? I do indeed . I just don 't know what it was we did cure . I would really love to take a look at what 's in that vial . Can you get up here ? I 'm just as interested in this as you are , Doctor . - I can be up there tomorrow . - Great . I 'll see you then . Matias , David Sandstrom . We 're just writing up your hazardous transfer protocol . Oh , great . That 's great . Listen ... Who did you send the tissue sample to in the U.S ? Well ... What do you mean ? Well , you got the name of a lab or researcher ? We didn 't send a sample to anyone in the United States . Oh , really ? I guess they got their sample from someplace else , eh ? No . No . We have all the samples that exist . Yeah , that 's what I thought . Okay . My mistake , my mistake ... Listen Matias , can you get me that sample sent as soon as possible please . - Yeah , sure thing . - Great . Yes , Bob , I know . Okay ? I know , I know , I just ... - I want you to keep working on it . - When does the sample arrive ? Right , the tissue sample will be there tomorrow . - Oh . Okay . - Okay . - Okay. bye . - Bye . Well , I gotta go to Newfoundland to talk to these families . - Send somebody else , David . - No , I can 't send somebody else , Caroline . It 's personal . Listen , here 's what I want you to do . I want you to call your friend McGuinn and I want you to ask him how the fuck they were able to identify Encephalitis Lethargica without the only known sample ? What ? What are you talking about ? That 's right . You 're telling me they have the only sample in the world ? Apparently . Then that must have been the sample they compared it to . But you don 't know that for a fact . This is the United States military , Caroline . We can track down a couple of Martians if we have to . What 's your point ? Well in that case can you send me a Martian ? You know , the sequenced viral RNA ? Sure . Any particular reason ? Well , it 's an amazing thing they did . You know , I think David is a little envious he was beaten to the punch . He 'd like to have a look at it . You know , scientific curiosity . - I 'll see what I can do . - Thanks , Connor . I know many of you have had a long day of traveling , so I 'd just like to thank you for all coming today . Thank you for coming out , Doc . Basically , your children have a genetic sequence which is reversed . It 's like , instead of A-B-C-D-E , they have E-D-C-B-A . Okay ? Now , this inversion , as we call it , means they can 't produce a protein that would allow them to make certain kinds of muscle cells , so without the protein , their muscles become rigid and tense . Is there a cure ? No . How ' bout making us one ? I wish I could . And I wish it was that easy , I really do , but a cure is years away . - You got any hope for us , Doc ? - Yeah . This inversion DNA is in all of your genes . Wait now , if it 's in our genes , then my little Hayley might someday stop being normal like my other daughter did ? Oh , not necessarily . See , it 's a random combination of recessive ... We could test her , and then we 'd know for sure . But see , knowing that it 's genetic is a really good place to start here . But if it 's genetic , and we gave them them genes , then why don 't any of us have it ? Well , like I was saying , it 's a recessive gene . So you need the right combination of ... You need two recessive genes , one from the mother and one from the father in combination to produce the illness . What if we want to have another child ... I don 't want another baby to suffer they way that our son did . Okay ... Hum ... Here 's what we can do . Early in your pregnancy , we can give you an amniocentesis and we can check for the presence of the gene that stunts the muscle growth . So ... so then we abort the babies ? Is that it ? That 's entirely your decision , but ... The alternative is to treat the fetus in vitro with the missing protein . The child would never ... would never get the illness . Unfortunately , once the child is ... once the child is born it 's too late for the treatment . I 'm going to advise Health Canada that they make this test available to even the farthest outports . In the meantime ... It 's the results of our research . Take this home . Look at it . Show it to your doctors . There 's a team working on something similar to this in Pennsylvania . I 'll get all our research down to them ... I appreciate that . If they don 't find nothing , how long 's my son got ? I 'm not really sure . My best guess would be ... seven or eight years . Yeah ... You know , Dr. Sandstrom ... I got caught out in the water one time , in a storm . I thought it was the end . But my son is suffering , and the best scientists in the world are powerless to stop it . I 've never been this scared before in my entire life . I 'm sorry , Earl . Thanks . For gettin ' us the truth . Good luck . Wes , has anything come in from McGuinn 's office ? Not that I know of . Why ? David 's expecting some information . - I 'll keep my eye out for it . - Any word on Dr. Henshaw ? - I haven 't heard from him . - Try to get in touch with him . I 'll get right on that . Yes , sir . It 's Wes . Everyone is getting anxious about Henshaw . What should I tell them ? I see . I will . Yes , sir . Yeah , that 's the one . Look , Wes , it 's the only number I got for Henshaw , okay ? I 'm not lying to you so ... I don 't know ... Call the airlines and find out what flight he booked himself on . I mean ... Yeah , good ... Oh , and Wes , when you 're on with the airlines ... I 'm thinking of Christmasing in France this year . Dad . You 're late . Shouldn 't have given you that extra key . What are you doing here ? What does it look like I 'm doing ? I 'm waiting for you . Look how beautiful she was . - Still is . - Well ... Fortunately she takes after her Grandad . Yeah , she 's a Sandstrom all right . Smart , good-looking . Cranky . She has your mother 's eyes ... Pretty soon ... I won 't know who she is at all . And when that day comes , I want you to put a bullet in my head . I need a beer . Me too . - Wes , where 's Mayko ? - I don 't know . - Jill ? - Don 't know . - Bob ? - Not the hall monitor . Really ? When did you get demoted ? - Hey . - Hey . I want to talk to you about those kids . - Newfoundland kids ? - No . No . The prion study that you did . About memory improvement . The kids in Pennsylvania . Sure . How 'd it go with the families ? Fine , fine . Really good , actually . Really good . Where 's Bob ? I dunno . Why do you want to know about the prions ? Do you know if he sequenced the Guardsman 's DNA yet ? - David . - What ? - Prions ... - Yeah . Tell me what you know about them . There were 500 children in the study . Yeah , I know , but you proved that the prions could improve memory , right ? Yeah , anywhere from 25 to 40 points . - Okay , that might do it . - David , why are you going back to this ? My dad has Alzheimer 's . And I was just kind of thinking that maybe ... Oh , God . Your dad . Jesus , David . We may have proved they had memory spikes , but those children still aren 't going to survive . I 'm just thinking , that maybe ... - David ! - Carlos ! Come and see ! Could you just put everything together in a box , okay , and put it in my office ? All right ? - Hey . - Whatcha got ? So Bob sequenced the DNA fragment that kept repeating in the Guardsmen . - It 's a reactivated retrovirus . - You 're absolutely sure ? The retrovirus RNA is in the serum of the soldiers . Blood , not just the cells . It seems to have come alive and it 's moving into the known cell parts of the blood . I don 't believe it , there it is . All right . Let 's find out if it 's infecting the other cells , if it 's contagious . - David ? - Yeah . The frozen tissue from Norway just got here . Finally ! Wow , okay , everybody welcome this coal miner to our lab . He 's going to be helping us out for a little while . He 's got great brains , eh ? David , the quality of the sample doesn 't look very good . It 's the very best we got , Bob . So , reverse-amplify the RNA , sequence it . Anything even close to what we 've got out of the Guardsmen - we celebrate . So I compared the genomes . This is the Guardsmen , and this is the frozen sample of Lethargica . - Identical ? - 99.9 % ! - It 's amazing ! - You were right , David . A virus everyone thought was long gone , here it is ! We isolated and sequenced Encephalitis Lethargica ! It 's just too bad somebody else did it first . David , I 'm having a hard time finding Henshaw . He 's a doctor from Ohio on a flight yesterday . - How fucking hard is that ? - I 'm doing my best . I 've got a few calls and I just need a little bit more time . The guy has a cure for Lethargica , Wes . Just find him . - I 'll get on it . - Thank you . Oh shit , Simon . Oh , okay . I 've had better hellos . But ... Oh , all right . Sorry , I 'm just ... I 'm working on this other thing and ... - I can come back . - No , no . Let 's get Mayko . - Mayko . - What ? Oh , holy shit . Simon ! I guess this is your new way of saying hello around here . When did you get in ? Tuesday , last Tuesday I think . Oh ... Nice . Well , to Montreal . Conference at McGill . - He 's here for 24 hours . - Oh , to talk about the prions ? Yeah . Come on . David , it 's crazy . What about ... How about cognitive enhancers ? Gingko Biloba ? Come on , Simon . No listen , there are therapies out there that can help protect the brain against memory impairment . Not that will make a difference to an Alzheimer 's patient . But we don 't know what prions really do , David . No one does . It 's virgin territory . Look , this is a fascinating , terrifying idea , but we 're not anywhere near ready to go there . Well , my dad is . I have absolutely no idea how we would extrapolate from an accidental poisoning over months to a single injection now . Work with me , Simon . We 'll figure it out . Okay , supposing we do . How do we test it ? On my dad . - Right . I believe that 's against the law . - It is . I 'll take care of that part . - Yeah , but we 'd be accessories . - What are you ? Scientists or lawyers ? - Well we 're certainly not murderers . - Yes , okay , yes , he could die . But , if he doesn 't , he 'll get a few good , sane years ! Which is a hell of a lot better than ten years fucked up with Alzheimer 's . He might die within a month . Or a week . You prepared to do that to your father ? So , in two hours , you are going to be over the ocean . I 'll be at Heathrow by 8 : 30 . Back in the lab by nine . Will that give you enough time en route to ponder the ethics of injecting David 's dad with prions . No . I think I 'm just going to help him figure out how to do that . Let him worry about the quandary . Call me . - I will . - Good . And remember , if you change your mind , my lab could always do with a brilliant , beautiful , bioinformatician . I 'll remember . Bye . Bye . Of course , I 'll make sure I pass that along . The two Guardsmen who were unaccounted for , apparently they went on a hiking trip last week . They still haven 't returned . Okay . I want to talk to you . In my office . Of course . Caroline , I 'm going home . I 'll be on my cell . David ! All the Guardsmen have Lethargica located at 11P43 on the genome . 11P43 has always been a benign piece of junk DNA . Now it 's Lethargica ? Yeah , but the good news is it 's not contagious , David . But the ' 20 's strain was extremely contagious . I think that 's the point one percent difference from the frozen sample . Bob , if it 's not contagious how did it spread between 30 Guardsmen ? - This is good news ? - And the bad news is that we all have Lethargica at 11P43 . What ? I checked the blood I took from all of us , ran the DNA . - We all have it . - But it 's dormant . It 's what 's intrinsic in the human genome ? Has Jill seen this ? I don 't know , I haven 't seen her . But David I think you 're wrong . - About what ? - The question isn 't how it spread . The question is : What woke it up ? You 're right . Or who woke it up . And are they planning on waking it up in all of us ? Shit ! Caroline , I 'm going home . I 'll be on my cell . Who 'd you call ? - When ? What call ? - Yesterday . I asked you to follow up on Henshaw . You made a call . - Just calling one of my usual sources . - And who is it ? Caroline , what 's going on ? I don 't understand why you 're- - Who 's your source , Wes ? General Coffey . Who is General Coffey ? He 's my contact at Homeland Security . What did he say about Henshaw ? He told me ... that a truck crossed the median and hit him head-on . And that he 's dead . You led us to believe you were still looking for him . Why in hell didn 't you tell us he was dead ? - I was instructed not to . - Why ? I was told that it 's a matter of National Security . Caroline , what would you have done ? NorBAC works with Homeland Security , Wes . Did you tell him that ? I 'm sorry you were put in that position . Thank you for understanding . Go back to work . Oh . And Wes ... if this happens again , you can talk to me . You got a second for some really bad news ? Me first . Henshaw 's dead . It 's been days . Where are all the samples we asked for ? Would you like me to spend a couple hours racing around , tracking them ? Come on , Caroline . I have other things to do . Like mass-producing your miracle cure , I hope . What are you talking about ? Encephalitis Lethargica is in everybody 's DNA , McGuinn . Yours , mine , the President 's . - So what do you want from me ? - Answers Conner . We need to figure out who 's behind this . And you need to get the antiretroviral to as many vaccine labs as you can , as fast as you can . And we need to stop whoever found a way to wake Lethargica up . I told you before , Homeland Security will track down the culprit . - I 'm doing everything I can . - Bullshit ! Why don 't you just tell us what 's going on ! Jill ! Hey . Up here . You seen Jill ? Hi , you 've reached Jill . After the message , leave a beep . You 're not here , you 're not there . Things are going fucking crazy and you 're like , AWOL . Where the hell are you ? Call me . What happened ? Her landlord called the lab . He said he found water coming from under her door . She 's in a coma . What they say ? It 's not looking good . Her GCS is 8 . English , Carlos . Glasgow Coma Scale . Eyes are 2 , verbal is 2 , Motor is 4 . 4 is pretty good , but the 2 's are ... - disappointing . - What are they trying ? Combinations of drugs : D4T , 3TC . NVP . I 'm going to take some blood and get started working on her . What 's it look like ? Jill 's blood . It 's deja vu . 11P43 . 30 Guardsmen in Ohio , now Jill comes down with the same thing . What the fuck is going on ? I need to find out how this retrovirus got reactivated in the Guardsmen . I need to know what they ate , what they breathed , what they drank , if they were given any medication . Everything ! Yeah . Yeah , I 'll get right on it . Okay . Bob . What made Jill sick ? You absolutely sure this fucker isn 't contagious ? Then give me another explanation . Look , Jill was in quarantine two weeks ago . Her stem cells . I 'm going to systematically go through her lab books . Looking for every possibility . And the impossibilities , too . Good , Bob . - Did you call McGuinn ? - I 've been calling . Wes has been calling . He was supposed to update us today . - I 'm going to Ohio . - I 'll go with you . - No , you need to stay here . - Why ? Because the lab needs you and Jill needs you . I don 't want you getting into a " head-on with a truck " . I won 't , David . I 'll come back with the anti-retroviral . Good luck . I was just about to knock . - What a day ! - Yeah , mine 's been a real treat too . What the fuck are you doing here ? - Thank you , Connor . - Don 't thank me yet . The Guardsmen had dramatic recoveries . Within 24 hours they were walking and talking . Then they started to get sick again . Turns out there 's a secondary virus , Phase II they 're calling it , - and this one 's even worse . - What does it do ? All their veins and arteries swell up . Could it be a reaction to the anti-retroviral ? They ruled that out . Did they put them back on the anti-retroviral ? - No effect . - What are your doctors recommending ? So the decision is ours ? I 'm sorry . I don 't know what to tell you . If this doesn 't work ... then Jill 's dead . Room 217 code blue . 217 . Jill ? No pulse . Starting CPR . One , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . One , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . - Get the atropine , 1 milligram push . - 1 milligram . - One , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . - Atropine 's in . One , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Atropine 's in . One , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Charge it to 200 joules . 200 . Clear . 300 . Clear . - 360 . - 360 . Clear . Dans le prochain épisode : * Jill 's lab books . The retrovirus that she sequenced in her stem cells , is Lethargica . Same as the Guardsmen . - That 's a hell of a coincidence . - That 's no coincidence . I got 12,000 sick troops . In a few minutes I have to make a recommendation to the President . I need to know if NorBAC is anywhere near a cure . - No . - Within a week ? We 're doing everything we can , Connor . What is it David ! Lethargica retrovirus in the human genome , where is it again ? 11P43 . - Fuck . - What ? - That 's Jill 's handwriting . - I know , Bob . It 's what she copied down from the Manford brothers ' board in Chicago , look ! I need a copy of everything that 's on Wes ' computer . Is anything wrong ? I don 't know . Something occurred to me in New York . Which is ... When we talk or even when I just ... see you at work . It 's like everything I need . You just wake up , now , okay ? I 've got a hunch I 'd like to follow up . I 'll be sending out this week 's mission to all field agents online , and I don 't think I can trust anyone else with it . Remember , only you know the whole story . Transcript : Raceman Subtitles : kubilai , Lama , Teuteu42

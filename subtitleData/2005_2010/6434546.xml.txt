 How did you find this place ? I 'm just lucky , I guess . I bet I can beat you to the shore . Well , we 'll see about that . Dr. Krause , elevate her pulse , please . Target the laser extractor , Doctor Medevenko . Isolate the adrenal gland , please . We must lower her pulse . This is the third mixture with no result . What 's your point , Krause ? He is not responding to the treatment ! It 's a dead end . Now he 's more shark than human . You see ? See what he has become ? Hold on , my friend . Our work is almost finished . He responded . I 'm going to send out the invitation . Come in . I 'm here to fix your computer Miss Lockhart . It 's about time . I called over an hour ago . They don 't usually send the head of the department . Nobody else wanted to do it . Seems you have a little bit of a reputation for being " difficult " . You think you can handle me ? Or die trying . You wanna go to dinner tonight ? I 'd love to , but I have to work late . I love to eat late . Don 't get cold feet on me . Have I ever lost your money ? I put your kids through Harvard , Harry . Listen , I know our stocks have been under-performing ... slightly ... but we 're on to something big . No , I can 't tell you that . But what I can tell you is that , if I don 't have your check by the close of business today , I 'm going to Lehman Brothers , because I know they 're in it to win it , pal . I 'm glad you feel that way . Gotta go . Rough day ? Couldn 't be better . Now , I 'm just a biologist , but I 've always assumed that falling stock prices are a cause for concern . They are . Unless you have a new drug coming out . Being head of R D , I think I would know about any new drug . Have you been going behind my back , Whitney ? Look at this . How long have you been in touch with King ? This is the first time I 've heard from that eccentric , crackpot bastard in five years . And it gets better . What 's this ? We leave tomorrow . I trust that 'll give you enough time to crack it . Like I said , Dr. King left out some key components of the formula . But if this what I think it is , then King may have very well solved the stem cell riddle . And what exactly is the stem cell riddle ? Stem cells are cells that don 't serve a particular purpose . The goal is to turn them into whatever kind of cells you need . For example , heart cells to replace cells damaged clue to heart attack . Up to now , no one 's been able to get a stem cell to produce the exact kind of cell they want . And you think that King has ? Based on the data , I 'd say so . And the possibilities are limitless . Growing organs for transplants , stopping the rapid degeneration of brain cells ... for Altzheimer womans ... A cure for cancer . Jane , draft a contract . I want full control , worldwide rights . Bernie , I want to see some financial projections . And , of course , Amelia will evaluate the science . Amelia , if King 's process is real , you have the opportunity to change the world . What happened between you and King is in the past . Listen , Amelia , I don 't want to pry , and I don 't want to talk out of turn but would you mind telling me what happened between you and King ? I 'd rather not talk about it . Amelia , I absolutely adore you . And no matter what it is , you can tell me . Did you have an affair with King ? I was supposed to be married to his son Paul . Is Paul gonna be there ? Paul died five years ago , of cancer . Journal entry , April 11th ... Finally , after years of seemingly endless struggle , I feel that my work is beginning to reap the rewards which I knew were possible . Yesterday , the injection we gave him seemingly worked . All of my fears of him degenerating into a mindless eating machine beginning to fade . If we can successfully facilitate dissemination , I am confident that the newborn child will hold the key to humanity 's future . In the coming weeks , I expect that he will regain his higher mental functions . The superior strength of a hammer head shark , coupled with the intellect of a man . Spray it down . Life is a gift , and my research will enable millions to welcome disease . Release it . This should be a lot of fun . A bunch of corporate stiffs . You and me by the sea . Oh , hi , Jane . Hi , Bernie . Flight 75 ... Check this out . Yeah , he just went through that rough divorce . Do you think you could help me with this ? Not a bad consolation prize . Hi . My name 's Tom Reed . We haven 't had the pleasure yet . Hi . Could you get these for me , sweetie ? " I haven 't had the pleasure ' yet . " Shut up . Behave . Alright ! The island , here we come ! Journal entry , April 13th ... The process is happening much slower than I had calculated . His appetite has become unquenchable . If I am unable to successfully get him to reproduce , I fear that he will continue to degenerate , becoming some son of primal killer with no human consciousness . It is essential that I find a subject that he will mate with , willingly . His offspring hold the key to a new breed of human . Imagine the possibilities . Human life thriving in the earth 's oceans . The dawn of the new Atlantis . This would have been much easier if we used sharks that laid eggs . Easier ? Maybe . But the Giant Hammerhead isn 't like other sharks . It 's the pinnacle of shark evolution . Nurtures its young in placenta . What 's a Great White ? It 's a machine ... swims and eats . Doesn 't think , like the sphyrna mokarran . The sphyrna is far more advanced , much more capable of being genetically integrated with the human race . Doctor , we have yet to cultivate a living cell line to put in those embryonic sacs . Don 't you think you 're getting ahead of yourself ? We 'll get there , Krause . What makes you think we can control it ? Fairamont has subject number eight . Four fifteen is ready , Doctor . Sooner than we thought . Doctor Krause , elevate her pulse , please . Scalpel . We must lower her pulse . Isolate the adrenal gland , please . Her pulse is dropping , Doctor . Target the laser extractor , Doctor Medevenko . Still unstable . I need to know the levels of the embryo 's endocrine system . Get her to the morgue . Conduct a full post modem . Look , I hope you don 't mind , but I dug up some articles about King off the internet . The guy really seems like quite a character . I almost feel sorry for him . His whole life crashed down ... and the government put a stop to his research . Yeah , I read that . But the articles were a little hazy as to exactly why . He was experimenting with cross species insemination . With animals , I hope . What ? Your " guests " , sir . Good . Good . Let 's greet my esteemed former colleagues ? And then , it 's time to invite them to dinner . Krause , it 's been a while . I see you 're still his right-hand man . Doctor King is in the midst of an experiment , but will be available shortly . I 'll show you to your quarters . In the jeeps , please . Please . - Whitney . - Preston . Never thought I 'd hear from you after you nearly put me out of business . Well , what 's done is done . It was just " business " . Amelia . I didn 't expect to see you . I didn 't really wanna come . I see . So , you still work for Feder ? I have your old job . Really ? Congratulations . No , perhaps it 's good that you came . Yes . I don 't know you . This is Tom . He 's head of I.T. Got some nice digs here , Doc . And Julie . She 's Feder 's friend . Well ... the more the merrier ? Miss Harper . Bernie . Welcome . Would anyone like a tour ? Now , I am particularly proud of this . Notice the dome . You see , I modeled the dome after Buckminster Fuller 's famous geodesic design . You see ? This way . - This is an aloe plant ... - I wouldn 't touch that . Nothing in here is quite what it seems . Let me show you . Is this why we 're here ? No . No , these are just experiments ... happy accidents . Let 's do this . We 'll have an early dinner on the beach . And then proceed to the presentation room where ... all your questions will be answered . My favorite spot on the island . I thought we 'd eat al fresco while the sun is still high . And at sunset , a festive surprise . I can 't get any reception . It 's a sat phone . They 're designed to work in the middle of nowhere . Maybe Tom should take a look at it . It 's just very strange . Please , everyone . What 's with all the security ? Maybe he knows how nasty you can get when you 've been drinking . Thank you . We 've been laid . Did you notice anything weird about this place ? You mean besides Doctor Mengel over there with the three fingers ? The pig with the three eyes ? No , I 'd say everything 's perfectly normal around here . Add my satellite phone to that list . It 's not getting a signal . Yeah , well , those things malfunction a lot . If you want , I 'll take a look at it after dinner . I just figured out who she is . Who ? That woman over there . That 's Katie Medevenko . She was arrested last year in Prague . For what ? Allegedly ? Genetic mutation experiments on human beings . Nice place you 've taken me . Amelia ! Come on ! Come on ! Did you know sharks never succumb to disease ? There 's not a single recorded instance of cancerous cells in sharks . Are you still obsessed with sharks ? How long do sharks live ? I have no idea . No one does . We used to think ten , fifteen years . Now some people believe two hundred . Wouldn 't that be something ? Never get sick and , perhaps ... live forever . What does this have to do with stem cells ? The most difficult pan of turning an embryonic stem into a specialized cell is cracking the reproductive code . Why ? Because we can 't isolate single strands of DNA for comparison . Exactly . Because we can 't see them . So I built a more powerful microscope . I cultivated embryonic stem cells from living specimens and isolated them by transferring their inner cell mass . So , once I was able to see the single strands of DNA , I could pinpoint the origin of the mutation . I saw the change . I mean ... how ? My subject had kidney cancer , in the later stages . Growing the new cells ... was relatively easy , - Paul had kidney cancer . But unfortunately my host subject rejected them . No matter how many cells I injected , they were all destroyed . And then it came to me . I needed to begin with cells that were already immune to the cancer . Shark cells . I then cross cultivated shark stems with human somatic cells . Once the molecular structure stabilized , the cancer went into complete remission . In two weeks . Are you saying ... Paul is still alive ? Alive ? Oh , yes . But he 's much more than that . I give you the future of the human race . My son had a disease . I cured him . Paul died of cancer . Did he ? His illness was an opportunity , a stepping stone . By mutating the cells I created the perfect organism embodying the advantages of both the sea and the land . And I gave my son eternal life . My god , King . You 've lost it . This meeting is over . What is this ? I didn 't plan on you being pan of this , Amelia . I know you loved my son . I 'm sorry . What are you doing ? You can 't just keep us here ! Actually , I can . This is not a court of law , Ms. Harper , where you can manipulate the judge and the jury . I am the judge here ! I find you all guilty of stealing my research and forcing me into exile . I sentence you to death . Is this some kind of a game ? Open the door ! The ladder . Pull up the ladder ! Tom ! Tom , let it flood ! Flood the room . Flood the room ! Right ! That thing 's gonna get here sooner or later ! It 's our only chance ! Everybody get under the ladder ! Follow me ! - Follow me ! I 'll get us out of here ! - Get the gun ! - I don 't know , I 'll lead the way ! - Tom , get the gun ! Hurry ! Left ! To the left ! Shoot out the fan ! Shoot out the fan ! Shoot out the fan ! Don 't worry , my son . There 's plenty of time to feast . Come on . Everybody , watch your step . We 're gonna need a rope . Give me your shins . Roll them up ! Bernie ! You go first . Come on ! When you get down there , hold the rope . Use your feet ! Come on ! Go ! You can run ... Hold the rope . Grab the rope . Not me , the rope . But there 's nowhere to hide . Go on . Nice and easy . Journal entry , April 15th ... It seems that Paul 's tracking beacon 's been damaged in his recent struggle . My guests have escaped from their first encounter with my son . I have advised my men to let them go . This is a test for Paul . If he 's not challenged , how will he learn ? I hope that Paul 's memories of Amelia will prompt him to mate . Additionally , the challenge of hunting down my betrayers will stimulate Paul 's intellect . Once they 're gone , I 'm sure ... Paul 's evolution into a more humanlike being will commence . Their efforts and escape are futile . They have no chance . I 've spent a small fortune ensuring that . King , do you read me ? Over . Go to the fence and check the power . Roger that . We 're on our way . It 's very , very dark down here . Which direction ? Let 's say we head right down here . We should see it in a second . Alright , I 'll take care of that . Right next to you . I don 't see that thing in here . Don 't worry about it . We 're armed . There it is . Let 's hurry up and get this over with . Looks like the power 's down . Great . That means this thing has free rein on the island till we can locate him . You sure you 're not seeing that thing on the tracker ? That 's a negative . Alright , open that box . We gotta get this thing powered up immediately . Alright , the green one . What 's that ? What the ... ? Take this , you freak ! You idiots . What are we gonna do ? Call a chopper and get the hell out of here . Can you do something with this ? I don 't think so . King has an FDS blocking the signal . Speak English , will you ? It 's a frequency jamming system . Now , I think I can override it , but we gotta get to high ground . That 's right . Now , let 's stick together . Let 's go . Erik ! What is going on out there ? We 're not getting any signal on the tracker . My son won 't last without his treatment . And I want our guests found . Bring them in , dead or alive . Except the woman . Be sure you capture her . Bring her to me . Roger that . It may take a while . You alright , baby ? I just can 't believe that thing is Paul . It 's not Paul . Paul is dead . I know . I know . I hate the jungle . I wanna go home . Some vacation . My clothes are ruined . My hair is ruined and I don 't wanna die . Oh god ! Help ! I 'm falling in the swamp ! Help me ! Help ! Oh , my god ! Shark ! Help ! Help ! Everybody get away from the water ! What are you doing ? We gotta get to the boat ! - It might be a trap . - She 's right . King 's men could be there waiting for us . Then what do you suggest we do ? I say we get to that dock as quietly as we can and we get a closer look . Come on . Yeah . Everybody alright ? Alright , I 'll be right back . Alright . It 's just a captain and two crew . We 'll bribe the captain to get us off this island . They 're King 's men . I have more money than King . Alright , we 'll give it a try . You two come with me . Amelia , you stay here with Jane and Julie . - I can take care of myself . - I know that . But I need you to take care of them . Alright . Alright , let 's go . Awaiting orders . Out . Just keep your eyes peeled . We need your help , Captain . King is trying to kill us . I can pay you much more than King can ... Untie the rope ! Are you insane ? Hold your fire ! It 's gonna blow ! Come on ! They 're done . And if not , that thing 'll finish them off . Let 's go . Come on , Paul . You 've been bred for this . Bernie ! Bernie , look out ! Look out , behind you ! Bernie ! Give me some room ! Oh , God ! Okay , he 's breathing . Oh , my god ! We have to stop the bleeding ! Here you go , baby . We gotta get out of here . They might come back . Not without Bernie ! We gotta leave him and get that phone fixed ! Look , this man has worked for you for five years ! He 's dead . If we stay here , so are we . Okay . Listen to me . Listen to me . Okay ? We 're gonna get you back to the compound and get some medical supplies , alright ? Hang in there . What are you talking about ? We can 't go back there . Okay , would you talk to him for a minute ? Keep him calm . Bernie ... Bernie ... We have to stick together and we have to protect everyone ! And I mean everyone ! We can 't go back there . King 'll be waiting . Maybe not . King will expect us to run . Besides , we got more problems than King right now . I say Amelia 's right ! We stick together . Julie and I are not going back to the compound . We 're gonna find some high ground and get reception . Anyone else coming ? Will he make it ? We gotta get this wound dressed . Then I 'll stay with you . You 're all dead . Come on . Get him up . Up . Here we go . Alright . Come on . Be cheerful , my love . Our revels now are ended . These are actors . As I foretold , you are all spirits that are melted into air , into thin air . What the hell are you talking about ? It 's ... actually , it 's Shakespeare , darling . I was just trying to cheer us up . Well , look , look ... path ... Be careful . There 's water . Oh , god . These shoes are ruined . Enough , Julie . Please help ! Julie ... Julie ! Would you please shut up ? Shut up , Julie . Help ! Help me ! You 're okay . You 're fine . You still have your sunglasses . And you 've still got your stupid phone . Hold it . You don 't have to do this , you know . Yes , I do . Okay , okay ... Come on . Okay . Come on . Let 's get moving . Wait . Stay here . Here , give me this . This place is crawling with guards . You hanging in there , Bernie ? Yeah ? Alright . Pack it up . Come on . Here we go . Alright . Let me take him this side . Okay . Alright . Come on . King , come in . There is movement on the ground . I repeat there is movement on the ground . - What was that thing , Whitney ? - It 's a shark . That 's the highest ground . Come on . As long as we stay away from the water , we 'll be okay . We made it . Now we , we just gotta get this thing to work . I don 't feel very safe up here . Rum Alright . It 's gonna be alright . Amelia ! Find us a way in . Jane ! Take him . Go on , honey . Get over there . Come on , buddy . Alright . Alright ... Just hang in there . We 'll get you fixed up in no time . Guys , I need some help . I can 't get in and the door is locked . Here you go , baby . - Come on ! - Jane ! Come on ! Get inside ! - Where 's Bernie ? - He 's gone . - No ! - No , baby ... He 's gone . Look , I 'm starting to get pissed . Alright ? Now , let 's see what we can find out about this freak show . Come on . - Erik ? - I 'm here . I found the other group . They 're in the morgue . Send someone down there . Kill the man but save the women . We can use them for testing . Yes , sir . Oh my god . Are they alive ? I don 't know . Amelia ... Look at this . This one was pregnant . He was trying to get the creature to reproduce . What ? That 's insane ! He knows . We 're being watched . Don 't move . Alright , go ahead . What are you doing ? Apparently , this thing has a problem with nitrogen . What does that mean ? Sharks have organs called Ampullae of Lonrenzini . They use it to detect prey when they hunt . What 's that have to do with nitrogen ? People can 't process nitrogen as quickly as sharks can . You ever go diving ? When we come up , we have to decompress . That 's the way humans release excess nitrogen . The nitrogen levels are already way too high . It 's a wonder its ampullae are even functioning . So , what happens if the nitrogen levels are too high ? It could possibly sent it into a state of shock . Or it could explode . Either way , we may have found this thing 's weakness . What 's that ? A little surprise , in case our friends come visiting . Alright . One less to worry about . Okay . There 's a helipad on the other side of the island . That 's not too far . And where there 's a chopper there 's usually a radio . That 's what I was thinking . What about that ... thing out there ? We got no choice . Come on . This thing is out of control . I know . As soon as this is over , we can get out of here . Now just keep quiet and drive . What the ... ? Stop ... Going somewhere , Mr. Feder ? Get up . Get in . It never ceases to fascinate me . The distance between the eyes . In the sphyrna the distance is greater than in all other genus . Their superior vision . Their sensory organs . Their ability to sense subtle changes in water pressure and electromagnetic fields . All that makes the hammerhead the world 's most dangerous killer . Which makes me wonder ... why are these people still alive ? Where are the others ? How should I know ? What were you doing up there ? It seemed like a good spot for a picnic . Did you by any chance make a call ? No . You wouldn 't lie to me , would you ? Check her pulse . What 's going on up there ? That thing got one of my guys and it almost got me . Where ? - Out in the valley . - The others ? Yeah , they 're still out there . - Find them and bring them in ! - Listen . He 's unstoppable ! I am not going to ... I 'll triple your salary ! Just bring them in ! I 'll take care of it . Doctor King , this has gone too far . I came here for science . Not for your personal revenge . This is science . Establishing results based on experiments . You need to be patient . We 're close . I will not be a pan of this anymore ! Do you want me to take care of her ? She 'll change her mind . And if she doesn 't ? My son is out there . She will not get off this island . Let 's continue . Team two . Come in . Over . Copy that . We need to find them pronto . There 's a huge bonus for the first man to spot the escapees . Don 't forget the map , baby . There 's some water here . Water ! Thank God ! Someone 's coming . Get in there ! Get in ! That 's Feder ! Oh , man . I never thought I 'd be so glad to see him in my life . Whitney ! Are you okay ? Where 's Julie ? It was horrible . She was my whole life . Oh my god . It 's not your fault . There 's a helipad . We figure there might be a radio there . We don 't need a radio if there 's a chopper . - What , you can fly ? - Three years in the Army . - Are you sure ? - I said helicopters , not jeeps . Damn them . I 've got their coordinates on the tracker . I 'll send out gun boats to sweep the island . Please . I want to help . Why should we trust you ? King is crazy . He 's a murderer . Not a scientist ! I came here to find a cure for cancer . Perhaps she 's lying . No , she isn 't . Dr. Medevenko ! He " ) me ! It 's too late . Let 's go . Let 's go . Dr. King . What are you doing here ? It 's ... it 's Medevenko . What about her ? He got her . Sir , I found a busted sat phone , so I 'm not sure if they got a call off or not . Nobody gets off this island , do you understand ? Yes , sir . I 'll just send some to run sweeps of the island , and I 'll cover the helipad . - We 'll get them , sir . - See that you do . Are you sure the helipad 's up this way ? It shouldn 't be much further . Doctor ? Bring my son in . He 's been out too long . Yes , Herr Doctor . Come on , guys . What ? What is it ? I don 't know . Oh my god ! Stop scratching ! You 'll spread it . It itches . Help me ! Oh my god ! It itches ! It 's burning ! Oh my god ! We need to find a way to neutralize the poison . Oh my god ! It 's burning ! Oh my god ! The water ! Oh my god ! Oh my god ! Jane ! No ! The water ! Jane , do not go in the water ! We 're gonna get you help ! Please get her out of the water ! Come on ! Let 's get to the helipad ! Won 't you just shut up ? Nobody tells Whitney Feder to shut up ! Got it ? Shut up ! Jane , come out of there ! Jane , give me your hand ! I can 't . Come on , come on ... let 's go . We 're wasting time . Get off me ! Take my hand ! Jane , take my hand ! Listen , Mister , while you 're still on my payroll , I call the shots ! I told you to shut up ! Oh , no ! No ! Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . Come on . There you are , Paul . My little boy . Hungry , you little bastard ? Hungry ' ? Hungry , you little bastard ? Hungry ' ? Vell , hello . It won 't be long now . - Dr. King ! - Yes ? - We 've got him back in the pool . - Fine . Nice shot , baby . Alpha team . Come in . Alpha team . Come in . Over . Yep . Roger that . Reading you loud and clear . Alright , let 's keep a sharp lookout , boys . Look sharp . Dr. King . Dr. King ! Do you have any idea how long he was out there , Erik ? I don 't know , doc , but we have a situation . He 's never been capable of that before . He 's evolving . He killed Krause . But he did it with purpose , with his hands ... like a human . My son . My son is still in there . Doctor , they 're headed for the helipad . Well , what do I pay you for ? Bring them in ! Yes , sir . There they are ! We have visual confirmation of target . Come in , Alpha team . Come in , Alpha team . Do you read me ? Over . Alpha team , do you read me ? We have no visuals at this time . I repeat . We have no visuals at this time . There it is . I can fly that thing , no problem . Here 's the deal . I 'll lay down some cover fire while you and Amelia blast your way to that chopper . Alright ? Come on . You ready ? Let 's give them hell . I love you . Let 's do it . Step on it . Get down ! Get down ! We gotta take off . Wait for Tom . Wait for Tom ! We do and we 're dead ! Chopper 's on fire ! It 's gonna blow ! Come on ! Make sure she 's still conscious . Then take these two back to base camp . I don 't wanna see them . That 's better . All in the name of science , my dear . What are you doing ? Where am I ? What ... What are you gonna do with me , you sick bastard ? What are you going to do to her ? Saving my son was child 's play . I was able to re-purpose the stem cells with shark DNA . He was your son . And he still is . But now , my goal is to evolve the human race into a whole new species . That 's why I need you . Me ? Where do I fit in to all this ? The new Eve , the new ... mother to the Spyrna Sapiens . You 're crazy . Crazy ? You 're equally responsible , Whitney . This is a result of our work together . It was just business , King . How much do you want ? This isn 't about money . Then what do you want ? Paul has yet to produce viable offspring . The amount of pheromones needed to peak Paul 's interest creates irreparable complications in the pregnancy . But you once had quite an effect on my son . That thing is not Paul . Smell is our strongest sense . With just a whiff , a scent , I can see my mother 's face again remember cutting the grass with my father and I believe that my son will remember you when he smells you . Couldn 't you just produce the same results in the lab ? I can only do so much here . I can combine species , but I can 't mate them . Procreate . For that , I need a womb . You 're going to impregnate me ? No . He is . What the ... What are you doing ? Get your hands off me , you stupid bastards ! Don 't you know who I am ? I 'm Whitney Feder ! I could run this place ! I could buy you ! My son is always a little hungry . Get your hands off me ! Perhaps if his blood lust is satisfied , he 'll be able to concentrate on his other urges . That wouldn 't be fair . I can buy this whole place . A pleasure doing business with you , Mr. Feder . Oh my .. Bye-bye . I envy you . You 're about to enter a brave new world . Why not use the process on yourself then , King ? You know , at one time I planned on it . But now , there 's no one left to administer my transformation , so ... I must be content to be the creator . What are you doing ? Now you 'll be in a better mood to reacquaint yourself with my beloved son . Pauly , look at me . Paul . My son . Poindexter ! Don 't move , baby . Get me out of this thing . Die ! We have to destroy this place . With pleasure . That 's just about it . Let 's torch this place and get the hell out of here . - No . There 's more . - What ? - The hatchery . It 's over here . - Wait ! Goddamn it . I 'm afraid ... I can 't let you do that , my dear . Like father like son . Come on , baby , let 's do it . There was a time when I would have done anything to stop all the death and all the pain . But now ... I love you .

 Previously on Heroes . Find Claire Bennet . Bring her back to me . You think you can do that ? Yes , sir , of course , I can . I 'm coming , too . Isaac Mendez is dead . This is the last posthumous issue . But it 's not the last story . The day that he died , Isaac Mendez bequeathed his sketchbook to a humble bike messenger . You find that messenger , you find your story . It 's got nothing to do with Dad . I 'm going to Pinehearst . His idea , giving people abilities , the right people ... Is wrong . It 's not wrong . It 's so right . We 're taking Claire with us . That 's what we came for in the first place . I 've read your files , Gabriel . You 're not their son . They 're just leveraging your mommy issues to turn you into their weapon . And I understand now that I 'm never gonna change . Theoretically , this formula is sound , but something is missing . Some kind of catalyst . The key component of this catalyst would live in a human host . I think I 'm the catalyst . That 's Claire and that 's Hiro , hiding behind the ferns . I think Hiro has to take Claire here to get his memory back . Hiro ! What did you do ? What the hell is going on ? Dad ? That baby is me . You 're Hiro Nakamura , aren 't you ? Peter told me about you . You 're a time traveler , so you brought me back in time . Why did you bring me here ? You don 't speak English ? Look . Is that you ? Am I here for you ? Where is train station ? I must use toilet . More waffles , please . Hey . Where are you going ? Should I stay with me or should I go with you ? Hey . Hey . What am I supposed to do ? Our son can hear us . Speak English . Are you feeling better ? We must face the inevitable . I am dying . I think it will happen tonight . We must make arrangements for the catalyst before it is lost forever . The catalyst . Are you sure ? Nothing will ever be the same . You must think of the future , Kaito . I will have Noah return with the baby . She is the perfect candidate . I wanted to keep it in the family . Absolutely not . Our son couldn 't possibly ... This conversation isn 't over yet . I know what I have to do . I think I can stop the catalyst before they put it in me . I can be a hero . I don 't understand what you 're saying . I have to follow my dad , protect that baby so they don 't inject the catalyst into me . I 'll meet you here tonight . Stay out of trouble , okay ? Okay . What ? You were supposed to be here by now . Where 's Claire ? Gone into thin air . What happened ? Don 't know . Don 't care . I 'm not helping you anymore , Arthur . I 'm not helping anyone . I talked to Bennet . He told me everything . He told me you 're not my father . I want the truth . And I know exactly where I 'm gonna find it . I 've got a whole new list of people with abilities . It 's gonna be very useful . Don 't do this . Come see me . Don 't worry . I will . Very soon . Goodbye , Elle . One shot to the back of his head and it 's done . You want me to kill him ? Why do you think I sent you and your brother to find the Haitian ? He makes Arthur vulnerable . And now that Nathan has switched his allegiance , it 's all up to you . Your father is far too powerful . He won 't be contained . If the tables were turned , he would not hesitate to put a bullet in your brain . Or Nathan 's . Why do you think I poisoned him , the man I loved , father of my children ? He tried to kill your brother . And if you get in his way , he will destroy you . You don 't know that . I know that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants , by any means necessary , no matter who gets hurt . There 's no other way . So , DOD 's on board . We 're all set . Well done , Tracy . Nathan . Nice to see you . What are you doing here ? It 's my job , Senator . Finding opportunities for you . Have you reconsidered my offer , son ? I agree with what you 're trying to do . The world 's a dangerous place , and it 's not getting any better . We need a leader , somebody with vision . And that somebody isn 't you . Is it you ? I 'm taking over Pinehearst , the complete program . I 'll work out of my office . We can use my resources . Who do you think you 're talking to ? I made you . You wouldn 't have gone to all this trouble to make me if you didn 't need me . You wanted a legitimate face for Pinehearst , a person with authority . Senator Nathan Petrelli . All right , Nathan . You win . Brief him on what we 've done . You 're angry . What do you expect ? You went behind my back . You 're supposed to be working for me . That 's exactly what I was doing . I 'm on your side , Nathan . Your father sees the problems in this world , war , terrorism . He wants to make it a better place . You have no idea who my father is . I know he 's crossed some lines , but he 's a vision for the future , and you 're in it as President of the United States . That is where you belong , Nathan . And I belong there with you . We 'd like to call it intelligent design . Until now , abilities have been random , given to good people and bad , whether they deserve them or not . When we perfect the formula , we get to choose who gets what power . And we have chosen the best . Meet the future . I want ten-hut ! Okay . Almost there . Hang in there . Oh , God . Come on . One more minute . Here we go . You 're doing so good . Oh , my gosh , let me help you . Thanks . My husband bailed on me . Our first day with an adopted baby and he had to go back to work . Oh , my gosh . Thank you . No worries . I 'm Bonnie , by the way . I 'm staying next door at the Monacos . I 'm their niece . Hi , Bonnie . I 'm Sandra . Thank you so much . Put them anywhere . Thank you . Okay . Come on , baby girl . Here we go . Nice place . What are you saying ? She 's probably just wet and doesn 't know how to tell you . Here . Let 's see . Up we go . There we go . There you go . Yeah . She 's definitely wet . Hi . You want me to change her ? Sure . Hi . There we go . There we go , little one . Wow . There we go . I 'm so glad I ran into you . To be honest , I 'm a little overwhelmed . She 's so little . I 'm completely unprepared . I don 't have a clue about how to take care of a baby . Well , I have a feeling you 'll do just fine . Besides , I have major babysitting skills . I could teach you a thing or two if you want . That would be great . What about your husband ? Is he good with kids ? Not really . Noah is very busy at work . He just got a promotion . Apparently , he is ... He 's very good at what he does . I 'll bet he is . All done . There we go . Thank you . There you go . It 's so strange . I 've only known Claire a few hours and I 'm so in love with her . I think she knows that . Yeah . Don 't let her out of your sight , okay ? What do you mean ? Oh , I just mean that she 's gonna grow up really fast . Believe me . I am gonna watch her like a hawk . Hi , baby girl . Hey , Sue . Is it really your birthday ? Hey , birthday girl . Sue Landers ? Special delivery . You 're lying . You 're not here to make a delivery . Impressive . How did you do that ? What do you want ? To understand what you do . A human lie detector . How does that work when someone tells a lie ? Does it tingle ? How did you know about me ? Who are you ? Someone who covets your ability . I have to find out the truth about something . No , you don 't . Trust me . I 'm sure it 's hard , seeing the ugly truth at every turn . Must make it hard to trust anyone . It 's not gonna hurt a bit . Got me . That 's a lie . I almost forgot how good this feels . Happy birthday ! Cake . Tell me what you know about this program . It 's gonna make us better Marines , sir . Yeah , but how ? Not exactly sure . Some kind of drug . I 'm told it 's safe . Sergeant , I want you to know exactly what it is you 've signed up for . The drug that we 're developing , it 'll change your life in ways you can 't possibly imagine . Forever . I get it , sir , but I have my reasons . I did two tours in Iraq . My last mission , last tour , RPG took our Humvee three klicks south of Kirkuk . Boatload of hajjis has us pinned down . I mean , we fought as best we could . End of the day , though , 12 of us went in , only two came out . That 's tough . On the trip back stateside , I couldn 't help thinking , why couldn 't I have been better ? You 're being too hard on yourself , Marine . Everybody says that . " You 're only human . " If only I was more than that , maybe they 'd still be alive , you know ? Yeah . I think I do . I like teleporting better . Less windy . I don 't care where you are . Hey ! You should have been there an hour ago . They 're waiting . Get it to them . Excuse me . We 're looking for a messenger . Sure , pal . What do you need delivered ? We need to find something . Someone . Yeah . A messenger picked up a package from an artist in a downtown loft , Isaac Mendez . We need that package . Sorry . Can 't help you out . Johnson . 57th and Lex . The messenger picked up this package last year . If you just ... Wait . Last year ? You 're kidding me . I can barely keep track of what we delivered last week . You have records , right ? Receipts ? Just look it up . His name was Isaac Mendez . M-E-N-D-E ... - Look , I 'd like to help , but city regulations prevent me from talking about deliveries . There 's no city regulation about that . What are you , a cop ? He knows something , Matt . Right . Sorry to do this to you , buddy . He does know about the sketches . Wait . How do you know that I know ? I also know that you 're skimming off the top . What , $ 5,200 already this year . Whoa ! Give us the sketches now . Okay . Fine . I got it in the back . It 's in the safe . I 'll go get it . That 's a great idea . We found them . Hey , you 've been a good friend to Hiro , nemesis . How come ? Well , it 's kind of my fault . I mean , I started this whole mess , stealing the formula ... No , no , no . It 's more than that . You 're doing it ' cause that 's the right thing to do and that 's who you are . Guys . He 's getting away . He 's got the sketchbook . We have to stop him . Allow me . What the ... Fine . I give . Remember , fifth grade , a boy named Danny . He 's cute , but he 'll break your heart , so whatever you do , do not share your juice with him . Don 't do it . Don 't do it , okay ? Who are you ? I 'm ... I 'm Bonnie . I was just watching the baby while Sandra set up the nursery . Hi , hon . I thought I heard you come in . How 's work ? You left the baby alone with some strange girl ? She 's not strange . Bonnie , this is Mr. Bennet . She 's a potential new babysitter for us . Is there a problem ? You can 't let a stranger into our home under any circumstances . Don 't worry , Claire . I 'm here to protect both of us . Something wrong ? Tell me who you are again . I 'm the Monacos ' niece . The Monacos don 't have a niece . So , I 'm gonna ask you one last time . Who are you and what the hell do you want ? You don 't understand . I 'm here to protect her and this family . Who sent you ? What 's going on , Noah ? Nothing . Just go on back in the bedroom . Does this have something to do with how we got the baby ? No questions . That was the arrangement . Please just go sit in the bedroom and wait . I 'll take the baby . No . Everything is fine , Sandra . Please , just go . I know you 're scared . You 're a Company man , and this little baby is your assignment . You 're thinking , how can she possibly be your daughter when they could take her away from you at any moment ? You 're trying so hard , but you can 't let yourself love her . What is this ? Are you one of them ? You a mind reader ? Something like that . Believe me . This little baby will be in your life for at least 16 more years , and many more , hopefully , after that . She 's gonna need you to protect her from so many things , terrible things . But you 're gonna love each other so much . How do you know all this ? No , don 't answer that . Why not ? It 's the Company , okay ? They want to take her back , just for a minute , but they 're going to do something to her and it 's gonna change everything . This little baby , your Claire-bear , she 's fine just the way she is . Trust me . Claire-bear , huh ? Thank you . Hiro ? Hiro ! Your silence betrays you . What ? No , I 'm fine . You know , I was just thinking , it 's too bad the eclipse had to end . The world would be a lot simpler without powers . To kill one 's own father is a horrible thing . He tried to kill my brother . He took away my powers . He 'd kill me if he had to . But he didn 't . You and I both know the world isn 't safe with my father in it . But I also know you , Peter . You want to save the world . You always have . It 's that part of you that wants to save your father . Give the gun to me . I 'll do it . No . Just like your brother was your responsibility , this one 's mine . Is something wrong ? No . No . Hmm . It does kind of tingle . I found it in some guy 's locker after he got canned . I had no idea how much it was worth . Every fanboy in the city 's been trying to grab it . My life 's been a living hell . I don 't understand . This is how it ends ? What 's happened to Hiro ? Maybe it 's not so bad . Right . Maybe this is just the cover to get people to buy it . Hiro will come back . He has to . Cheerleader , it 's over . We can go home now . Hey , you speak English . I thought that ... It 's a long story . Just know that I have taken the catalyst . The light is in me now . We have saved the future . Wait . You put the catalyst in you ? Guess I showed up just in time . Keep away , Arthur Petrelli . I will save the cheerleader again . I don 't think so . I 'll take the catalyst and your powers , too , Hiro . You 're a dead man . No ! Hiro . As for you , I need you to deliver a message for me . Tell Angela it 's over . I won . Hello ? Cheerleader ? Hello ! Anybody there ? Help ! Help . Please . I can 't believe it . Hiro is stuck back in time 16 years ago and no powers . Maybe it isn 't all bad news . Arthur Petrelli has the catalyst . He can perfect the formula . Yeah , wait , he can give people powers , so that means that there can be another time traveler . Someone to save Hiro . Maybe it could be me . I can go back in time and save Hiro . We got to find the formula . How do we find the formula ? Doctor . Ready to change the world ? ID , please . We 'll need 50 doses to begin , one for every Marine . We 'll just try it on one first . Let 's make sure this thing works . No offense . What is it ? Nothing . Just a minor inconvenience . Call your first Marine . I 'll be back . Peter , I 'm glad you 're here . Nathan and I have just been ... Don 't be ridiculous . So , you 're here to kill me . I 'm here to stop you . Creating abilities like this , giving them out , you 'll destroy the world . In your opinion . I 've seen it . This ends now . I don 't think you have the nerve to kill me , Peter . I like your choice . Very all-American . We could put him on a poster . Where 's my father ? We don 't need him . You 're in charge , remember ? All right . Let 's do this . What the hell happened to you ? - Mistake . Hopefully , this formula will fix all that . Wait . What 's in there ? It 's all right , Scott . Who is this guy ? What 's happening ? I 'm not sure . He 's too strong . I cannot hold his powers back . Listen to me , son . There is another way . The formula is ready . Nathan is here . I can give you your abilities back . We can start over . No . Wait ! Peter ! Just wait . Shoot him now . That 's your problem , son . Too much thought , not enough action . How could you be my son ? Hello , Arthur . Gabriel . You 're here . I am . No place I 'd rather be than with family . Are you really my family ? Of course . I 'm your father . No , you 're not . Now I know the truth . You 're not a killer , Peter . I am . There 'll be no need for that . I 'm not gonna kill you . You don 't have anything I need anymore . I 'm sorry , Peter . Your father was the one who had to die . Go after Sylar . It 's over . How do you feel ? I feel good .

No no no ... I 've just ... I 've just been thinking . I 've something I need to tell you . It 's not fair to keep it from you any longer . What you can do ... I 've known about you Claire . I knew before you knew . Before you made those tapes with Zack . You saw the tape ? Why didn 't you say anything ? There were a lot of reasons , but mostly I just wanted to protect you . Protect me ? All this time I ... All along like I 'm .. like I 'm sort of freak and you knew ? I 've worked very hard , I 've done some things I 'm not proud of to keep you safe . What kind of things ? I just wanted you to have a normal life . Jackie died because of me . He thought she was me didn 't he ? That man is taken care of ... I promise you . You and mom knew all this time You 're mother doesn 't know . Neither does your brother . Actually Lyle kind of found out . Really ? Anybody else ? Zack ... Nobody else can know , It 's the only way to keep you safe . That man there tried to kill you . There are others out there like him . Who want what you have and will hurt you to get it . That 's why we can 't tell your mother , we can 't tell anybody . Do you understand ? Yeah . I 'm going to pick up Lyle from practice and I 'll talk to him , you talk to Zack . And the tapes you 've made ... I need you to destroy them . The victim was a student , Jaquline Wilcox . And the crime scene fits Sylar 's , I know . He took her brain ? No , but the inscision in her skull says he wanted to , but somebody got in his way . I have a suspect in custody , a [ ? ] nurse from New York . And you think he may be Sylar ? No ... I think this is - See , judging by the blood patterns I 'd say he stopped here to catch his breath and then just , disappeared . You know what ? Maybe he didn 't ... Look at this . The tread patter is totally different . These are two new sets of footprints . You had four handful of those you 've knocked out since we got off - I have headaches ! It 's the whole [ ? ] She slipped up Parkman . It sucks but it happens . - You never cheated on her ? - No . You don 't believe me . Well , statistically speaking , law enforcement attracts a certain kind of male personality . Oh ! What personality would that be ? Dogs . And the female personality ? Bitches . We keep it in the K-9 family . Okay , so ... two new sets of footprints . You think Sylar had accomplaces ? With the amount of blood he lost , there 's no way he got out of here by himself . So I guess we 'll ask this ... Peter Petrelli . What are you ... What are you doing here ? You get in trouble , I drop in and fix it . Isn 't that how things work ? Get you out of here soon . No lecture ? I 'm just glad you 're alive . Why did you destroy that painting ? Why did you try to keep me from coming here ? That painting showed you dead Peter . And when I got the phone call , I nearly believed it . I Thought I 'd be a hero ... Yeah ... how did that work out for you ? Save the cheerleader , save the world . You were meant to do a lot of things Peter . Saving the world isn 't one of them . You got to learn to recognize that life is bigger than you are . You 're not a fighter . That 's ok , the world needs nurses too . When I 'm around you , I can do what you can do . Isaac ... Hiro Nakamura ... this girl Claire ... [ ? ] the same somehow . This bomb that Isaac painted , I think we 're supposed to stop it ... I just ... I don 't think I can do it . That 's because you can 't . How can you stop whats coming ... When you don 't know anything about power ? - Micah ! - Dad ! Stay down ! What are you looking at ? Anything ? Slept through the night . I got this . You lost a lot of blood . We sowed you up the best we could . Turns out your not so untouchable after all . You 'll find your abilities won 't work . Not here . You 're not going anywhere , Gabriel . - My name is Sylar . - Now it is . Wasn 't so long ago that you were Gabriel Gray . An insignificant watch maker . I restored time pieces . You know why I was so good at it ? No , why don 't you tell me ? Because I can see how things work . What makes them ... Tick . Like you . We 're interested in how things work as well . Everyone else we 've ... met has only one ability . You 've taken on several . This is what makes me special . It 's important to you isn 't it ? Being special . It 's important to everyone . I think you 're insane . I think the infusion of so many alterations to your DNA has corrupted your mind . All this power is degrading you . Yet here I am , alive and well and as soon as I 'm out , I 'm going to collect one more ability from your daughter . Sweet , innocent ... - That 's enough ! - Ripe ... - Indestructable . - I said that 's enough Gabriel . MY NAME IS SYLAR ! Options ? There are no options with an individual like this . Maybe I didn 't make the risk clear - Understood ... . ' course . Is it true ? You have to be a little more specific . You know I got more than one house on fire at the moment . We 're keeping him alive ? That was our marching orders . Think about what he almost did to Claire . I could tell him to kill himself . No one would have to know . I don 't have time for this , not today . You know I 'm right ! I know I 'm right ! And if that ... that Hatian could speak , he 'd tell you I 'm right . Take that ... take that ... that 's it . Walk back the way you came . In the footsteps . - Like the Indians ? - Just like the Indians son . That wasn 't the police . You don 't know that . Dad they got to warn you before they shoot . It 's a rule . The police don 't always follow the rules son , trust me . Give me a hand . Right here ... - Dad are you going to be okay ? - Your daddy is going to be as good as new . I just need you to help me with these bandages . You can do that right ? Yeah . Alright ... It was her wasn 't it ? It was Jessica . She looked like your mom . Mom would never hurt you on purpose . She just did Micah . [ ? ] Dad ? Dad wake up ! Dad you need to wake up ! Your brother is pretty well connected . Even though I 'm here ... I 've had to climb over six lawyers to get to you Mr. Petrelli . Are you okay ? My head feels like it 's going to split open . Help yourself . I didn 't kill that girl . We know . The blood we found on you was your own . We checked you out , and you don 't seem to have any injuries . Care to explain that ? If I 'm not being charged can I go ? What 's a [ ? ] nurse from Manhattan doing at a High School homecoming in Texas ? You some kind of pervert ? My brother said not to talk . We don 't need you to talk . What are you doing to me ? Save the cheerleader ... Too late for that .. the cheerleader 's dead .. Claire is dead ? That 's not possible . Did he just read her mind ? Is he one of them ? The cheerleaders name is Jackie Wilcox . - What the hell is going on ? - No ! Claire is the one he wants . - Claire ? - You 're not protecting her ? Why would you know who he wanted ? You want to catch this guys ? You need to find her . You need to protect her ! He is telling the truth . We better find this cheerleader . You 're not going to let me out of here ? You get out when I get answers . I faxed the list to your [ ? ] office yesterday ! Names , addresses , why wouldn 't you warn them ? Looking into it ? At least six of the people on the list are dead - all from the same killer ! James Walker in Los Angeles was killed 9 days ago . Charleen Andrews , 2 days ago Midland Texas . Doesn 't this mean anything to you people ? ! But do you really want to take that chance ? Fine . I won 't . Nevermind ... You 're sketching . I am . And you 're sober . The locks on the door help . Anything interesting ? Nothing predictive , if that 's what you are asking . I don 't think I can do it clean . You 'll get there . To be honest , It 's nice to be drawing just to draw again . That 's what I liked about comics . You don 't have to take them too seriously . Good guys catching bad guys ? Which reminds me Claire ... The cheerleader ... She 's alive . Peter ... he saved her . No , you did . Was your gift , I mean , thanks to you . Sylar won 't be able to hurt anybody anymore . This means we can change the future . Maybe stop that bomb . Now , I wish you the best of luck . Why ? Where you going ? Off the reservation . You 're leaving . What good is painting the future if no one will do anything to change it ? So change it . Hello ? Hiro ? Hiro Nakamura ? Yes ? - This is Isaac Mendez . - Mr. Isaac ! Hiro ... We need to meet . And then he grabbed her ... I tried to save her but he was killing her She told me to run , so I ran . I left her and I ran . I 'm sorry Claire , I know you 've been through a lot . I just have a few more questions . This man ... Did he exhibit anything out of the ordinary ? You mean besides killing my friend ? No , like being able to fall five stories and walk away without a scratch . What ? You said Peter Petrelli tackled the man who killed Jackie and they both fell over the ledge . That 's a pretty long fall . Is Peter okay ? He survived . Without a scratch . - How do you think he did that ? - All I know is he saved my life . He is a very lucky guy . You didn 't seem to get hurt at all either . Guess I 'm lucky too ... We found some of your blood at the crime scene . Look I 've told you everything I know , Okay ? Do you have what you need ? Agent Hanson . Yes . Of course . Thank you both very much for your time . Wait , can I talk to Peter - Excuse Me ! - Yes ? Uh , Mr. Bennet I just want to let you know that we are doing everything in our power to uh ... to get this guy . Well I appreciate that mister ... Uh , Parkman . Officer Matt Parkman . I really appreciate that Officer Parkman , Thank you . You don 't have to be a mind reader to know she 's hiding something . What is it ? I didn 't get anything . I mean ... I. There was this distinct ... - absence of sound . - You mean silence ? No , it was more like a static interfering with my ... - ... whatever the hell this thing is . - That 's a new one . No its not , actually I 've heard this before once when I went to that bar . Its the last thing that I heard , or didn 't hear before I lost a day . D.L ... Did I ? Get up . What did you do ? What I had to do to get Micah back . If you cared about Micah you wouldn 't have taken those shots ! You could have missed ... I don 't miss . You saw D.L. ' s jacket D.L. is Micah 's father . D.L. is a criminal . He brought danger into our home . You want Micah to end up like that ? You 're wrong about him . You 're out of control . What do you know about control Niki ? You 're a part of me . You do what I say ! Doesn 't work like that . Not anymore ... Why are you doing this ? ! Because you 're not strong enough ! MOM ! Micah ? ! Mom is that you ? Coming ! You 're okay ! Thanks to you . Mr. Petrelli . Claire 's father Hi You saved my little girl . I owe you my life . I was just in the right place . Maybe one day I 'll be in the right place . And can return the favour . Are you feeling alright ? Yeah ... I 'm fine . Hey dad ... Can you wait outside ? Of course . How long have you known ? Known what ? That you 're like me . You would have died if you couldn 't . Do you heal ? Is that it ? All this time I thought it was just me . Now there 's you ! Is that why you came for me ? Is that why you ... asked me if i was the one ? No , I just .. I knew I had to save you . Why ? Save the world . What do I have to do with the world ? I don 't know . Yet ... I do know that I don 't think I would be here if it wasn 't for you I think I 'd die . I 've died before ... It 's no big deal . I 'm not like you Claire . This is uh ... this healing thing is kind of new for me . Wait , you didn 't know you were going to heal when you jumped off the building ? No . It 's kind of stupid huh ? No it not ... You 're totally my hero . Micah ! Mom ? Mom is that you ? Mom ! Dad 's hurt . Where is he ? In there ... he 's bleeding . Bad . Stop fighting ! Stop fighting ... It 's for your own good ! Micah ! Micah ! Are you okay son ? Micah ? Stay away from him ! It 's me baby . Mom is that you ? It 's me . I am so sorry . I 'm so sorry . - Hey ! - Hey . So what have people been saying ? Well , offical word is that someone got killed in the high school but ... everybody knows its Jackie , I got like 4 text messages this morning . Did you bring the tapes ? Um , yeah . It wasn 't that much to - That 's pretty destroyed right ? Yeah , don 't think they 're going to play again . Wha - ? I feel really bad . About breaking up and pushing you to go to homecoming last night , I 'm sorry . You shouldn 't feel bad . You did it because you 're my friend . Probably the best friend I 've ever had . No , I 've only been your friend for 2 weeks . Hey I didn 't say it [ ? ] You know you could 've been killed . Look , I got to go . My dad just wanted to .. make sure that you were 'nt going to say anything to anyone . Of course . Cross my heart . Thanks Zack . Hiro Nakamura , I presume ? Mr. Isaac ? This hasn 't even gone to the printer yet ! Its ... Its ... incredible ! You really went to the future ? - Jumping through time ... I mean - - And space , Your power very strong too . I 'm not so sure about that . I can only do it when I 'm chasing . Ah , stoned On drugs . What else did you see there then ? You know ... I saw the bomb . Explode in the city and ... destroyed many things . And I saw you ! What about me ? I saw you on the floor ... You are dead . With your head ... cut ... off . Oh Okay . The man who ... Cuts off heads . He 's taken care of . - He is caught ? - That is very good new . Hiro lost a friend The [ ? ] had killed her . Wait a minute ... I painted this 2 days ago ... sober . Is this your friend ? Yes . I did it . You say your mission is to stop the bomb ... In New York ? Yes ... Our destiny . I think it may be mine too . I painted that [ ? ] on my floor . Very recently I painted a picture of ... a man ... eploding . How do you stop an exploding man ? Mom ... Dad ... Mom 's at the store I don 't know where dad is Did dad talk to you ? About what ? About me . He knows . And he knows that you know . My thing ? That I can 't get hurt . That didn 't hurt ? Lyle , I 'm serious . Now tell me what dad said to you . I haven 't seen dad all day . He was supposed to pick you up from practice . Well he didn 't . Well how did you get home ? Lyle ... How did you get home ? I .. I don 't remember . I can get you some help . You don 't understand . I know doctors that can help in situations like this D ... she 's stronger than me . I don 't believe that for a second . You 've seen what she can do ! How do you explain that ? There are a lot of things that I can 't explain . Like why you shot me . Jessica shot you . She 's going to come back and take Micah . She 's out of control . She could really hurt him , even ... I can 't be trusted . Niki ... Micah ? You alright man ? Yeah ... I 'll get you to a hotel We can get you cleaned up . Niki ! We are going to a hotel ... Nik . Can I help you ma 'am ? Yeah you can arrest me . Arrest you ? For what ? Murder . Really Parkman , since when does absence of noise warrant a stake out ? You always say I don 't take you anywhere . You sure know how to spoil a girl . Eat your tex-mex Got to say , he can be cute . Oh god , did he just hear that ? Did you just read my mind ? You can 't do that . It was a stray thought I ... You can 't do that . You really think I 'm ... . cute ? I really think you 're married . And I really think you love your wife . I do . Then why haven 't you called to yell at her so you can go home already ? That 's what you want , itsn 't it ? I don 't want to be a chump . So still loving your wife after she has sex with someone else makes you a chump ? Doesn 't it ? Grow up Parkman . If you want your marriage to work , you have to find a way to make it work . Otherwise you are kind of a chump . Cheerleaders dad , 9 O 'clock . That guy that 's with him . I know that guy . From where ? He was at the bar . The night I first heard that static . What , how do you know I thought you lost that whole day ? Matt maybe we should get out of here . Hold on I 'm just trying to get - I was only able to get one word . What ? Sylar . Hi Claire , I 'm here . What 's the emergency ? Something 's going on . Its like the - stepford-body-snatcher or something . My brother doesn 't remember anything . What I can do , nothing ! It 's like they made him forget . All right so this is another one of your little cheerleader initiation pranks , is that it ? hmm ? Is it ? Zack ! Are you listening to me ? Something is going on ! What is your damage ? Look , you haven 't talked to me since sixth grade and now you call me out of the blue ? What is this about ? They got you too ... Are you on crystal meth or something ' cause this is really cracky behaviour . Claire ! You see yourself as some sort of humanitarian don 't you ? A do good-er , hero , kidnapping men and women who are different . Does that make you feel powerful ? We 're quite alike you know . You collect special people . So do I. We 're going to take you apart Gabriel . Like one of your little watches . I 'm sorry , timepieces . I 'm going to find out exactly what makes you ... Tick . I don 't think I can do this . Yes you can . Concentrate . - Hello ? - Tell me you remember . You ... you remeber what I told you ? Last night don 't you ? You remember what we talked about ? Of course I do , what 's going on ? You said ... that there were people who wanted to hurt me . I think they got to Zack and Lyle . I don 't remember anything ! It 's like it never happened ! I don 't know what to do . Where are you ? I 'm at home Where 's mom ? Where 's ... where 's Lyle ? Just stay where you are , I 'll be right there . I love you Claire . You 're going to be okay . Okay . NO ! I work for your father . He sent me here to make you forget . Like he sent me to your friend . And your brother . And to your mother so many times . He 'll be here soon , expecting that you won 't remember anything . But it is very important that you do . Tell me Claire ... can you keep a secret ? - Hello ? - Mohinder ? - It 's me . - Eden ? Look ... I 'm not who you think I am . I lied to you and I 'm really sorry , and I 'm going to explain it all to you soon . Where are you ? Whats going on ? First I need to make things right . Starting with killing the man who murdered your father . Eden wait I - I do know you don 't I ? I live next door to Chandra Suresh . That wonderful ability . Power of persuasion , and you were the girl next door ? I 'm going to take this gun and I 'm going to put it in that slot and you 're going to take it and you 're going to blow brains out . You knew didn 't you ? ! You knew what I was and you let it continue . In a way you helped me . Then after I 've consumed your power you will help me even more . Ahh , even you know that won 't hurt me . What are you doing here Nathan ? Let 's go . Aren 't you going to ask what happened ? I know what happened , you got yourself in trouble , you nearly got yourself - I saved a girl . Had to be a hero didn 't you ? Get it out of your system now ? I finally get it now Nathan , I had these dreams and what my ability is , I can do what they can do . You look like hell . And I was with that girl ... and that guy who was trying to kill that girl ... and this , this cop ... I ... I think he was reading my mind . They were all like us ! Dysfunctional ? No ... they ... Nathan I 've to stop that bomb . I 've to save everybody . Right now I 'd settle for you walking . Easy ... easy . It 's alright , it 's alright . It 's alright . It 's all my fault .

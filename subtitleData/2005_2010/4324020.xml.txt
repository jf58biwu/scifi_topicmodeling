 What do you think is going on around here ? Well , Doc , I 'll tell you . This is the middle of America . Folks around here don 't get the big city blues . We worry about the price of corn , not terrorist attacks . Wes ! I don 't want excuses , I don 't want theories , I want to know what happened to that research . I think we should sit down and talk to David . I think that Connor McGuinn would like that . That 'll get you in anywhere you want to go . If you find what you 're looking for , let me know . I 'm not the enemy . Fuck ! What is that ? Concentrated retrovirus in medium . Shower now ! - You think the water might be poisoned ? - Could be . You think that 's what killed the deer ? Ah shit ! Parasitic worms . - Where are the worms coming from ? - They lay their eggs in the water . Okay , I 'll alert the Governor of Arkansas . You better alert the Governor of Missouri , Iowa , and Illinois while you 're at it . We don 't know how far this has spread up the Mississippi . - I have crystal . - I 'm clean these days . - Do you mind if I do ? - No , go ahead . Ramona ! Come on ! Come on ! Get up ! Come on ! She 's dead . - I fucked up . - Yeah , you did , Owen . You really did . David ? Dad ? Uh , David , uh ... I don 't have to tell you everything I do . This is exactly why I got you a caregiver in the first place . She couldn 't have done anything about the fire . She might have found your pipe before it lit up the couch . No , I got it . I got it . I got it . I got it . So this is where I 'm going to spend the rest of my life ? Not bad , eh ? A brick box . If you wanted a suite at the Sutton Place , you should 've been nicer to me as a kid . What ? Nothing . Come on , Dad . Well , they certainly spared no expense on the decor , did they ? Bed 's nice and firm . No bed rails ? Drawers don 't stick . Cheap laminate . Nice . Oh yeah , those are great . Well , at least they 're flame-retardant ! You just won 't leave it the hell alone , will you ? Dad , you could have been killed in that fire . Yes ... And for that one mistake , I will die here surrounded by ugliness . Jesus ... What are you looking at ? ! What ? Oh . Good morning ... Excuse us . We 'll upgrade you . I 'm sure that suites become available here all the time . Yes , because people die here all the time . Whatever survived the fire will be here in a couple of days , all right ? We 'll get some of your pictures up on the wall , you know ? Nice , nice ... Make the place look just like home . I have Alzheimer 's . - Did you hear me ? - Yeah , I heard you . I was diagnosed a few weeks before your mother died . So uh ... I 'll see you soon . Welcome to Toronto . Oh , God ... Do you want to stay with me ? I 'd like that . 2.11 - Fishy Jesus Christ ! What the fuck you doing ? Been eating ' that poison for close to three years now . Not a big fan of halibut myself . You 're the head guy on that panel . Advised the government : told ' em that genetically modified fish were safe for human consumption . - Well , everyone but that one . - Look , I ain 't in no mood for your humor . - I 'll take my act somewhere else , then . - I sent ya a hundred emails . - Jesus Christ . - Earl Jordan . Earl at total email dot ca . Oh , great . Look , M. Jordan , that panel was , like , four years ago . And we debated genetically modified ... - I know all about you and your bullshit ... - Well then you know that we didn 't say the fish were safe , we said there was nothing we could find to say the fish was unsafe . You get the difference ? I got something to show you how wrong you are ... That 's my boy , Dr. Sandstrom . Perfectly healthy until eight months ago . One day he 's running in the yard , the next he 's all crippled up in pain . Whole body 's paralyzed now . Can 't say a word ... You think that genetically engineered fish did this ? My wife ate the fish when she was pregnant . Now look what happened . I 'm sorry about your kid but there 's a hundred ... They took his blood , they X-rayed his brain , they poked and prodded him with every goddamn surgical tool they got in Newfoundland and nothing ... They even sent us up to Toronto for tests . Still nothing . - I know this is a touchy issue ... - Don 't you patronize me , you son of a bitch , or I 'll put you on the windshield . There 's only one reason that the fish farms are allowed to do their business . 'cause the government said it was safe . Because you told the government it was safe . - No , I never said- - - Look I know what you said ... All right . I get it . You think I 'm an asshole . Anything else I can do for you today ? Yeah . I got one more thing for you . Here 's my boy 's samples . Blood , urine ... Look at his charts , his X-rays . If it ain 't the fish that 's doing it to him , tell me what is . You ain 't gonna help me , are ya ? I kinda figured , driving up here . I promised his mother I would . She just stares at Kenny . Hopes he 'll be a healthy little boy again . Be able to just ... see him smile at her like the way he used to . He can 't even smile no more . Seems like none of us can . Sorry about the windshield , Doc . Shit ! - Hey . - Hey , boss ! - When did they let you out ? - About four hours ago . They decided they needed the bed for a sick person , eh ? - That 's right . - Get caught up on your reading ? Yeah , and I 'm still , like a thousand hours behind on my retrovirus work because of a crappy piece of lab equipment ... That reminds me ... What is this ? Happy Homecoming . David ... A brand new Vortexer . Ahh ! Look at that . - It 's silver . - Yeah . It 's very sweet of you , thank you . Yeah ... Oh . And there 's more ... You remember that Italian study on reactivation of retroviruses you were wondering about ... Using the mouse genome ? Yeah , they haven 't published , yet . No ... But they sent me a pre-print copy . - You 're kidding . - I was going to bring it to you today . I only looked at the abstract , but I think you 're going to find it - pretty interesting . - Give me that ! Wow . Wow . Wow . - Thank you . Thank you . - Oh ! You 're welcome . - It 's good to be back . - Good to have you back . It 's good to see your back . Earl ... Persistant bastard . Shit . Once inside the victim , the worms began to secrete phorbol , which in turn activates Protein Kinase C. What 's that ? A protein that 's been linked to depression in humans . So where do these worms come from ? We found some isolated cases in a remote area of Haiti . We think they got to New Orleans on the winds of hurricane Katrina . - So is the condition treatable ? - Well we 're showing some positive results using an anti-parasitic drug , niclosamide , used in animals to kill tape worms . - Excuse me . - Sure . - Got a sec ? - I 'm on hold with McGuinn . - I need to buy a new pencil . - Can 't this wait ? Look , something has come up . It 's kind of eating ' at me . I just need to look into it . Won 't take long . - You still there ? - Yeah . - So that 's okay ? - We 'll talk later . Absolutely . Thanks . David ! - Caroline ? - Connor . When do you think you could get down to Washington ? - What are we talking about ? - About dinner , a good night 's sleep and then we sit down with the Appropriations ' Committee chairman , who happens to be from Arkansas and is anxious to hear about your work down there . - I 'm on my way . - Good work , Caroline . Thanks . Something has come up . It 's kind of eating ' at me . I just need to look into it . Won 't take long . - You still there ? - Yeah . - So that 's okay ? - We 'll talk later . Absolutely ! Thank you . David ! I just need to borrow this . The thing is ... Thank you . The thing is , some fisherman from Newfoundland just tried to kill me with a 15-pound halibut . - Fried or baked ? - The guy was both , if you ask me . Morning . Is that what we 're having for dinner tonight ? You 're coming ? Not if that 's what we 're having for dinner tonight . - Lamb shanks . - Lamb shanks . I love your lamb shanks . With the herb and garlic rub and the balsamic glaze ? - Those 'd be mine . - Awesome . - I 'll pick you up . - Oh okay . So Mayko , see if you can dig up any recent public health studies on GMO fish , alright ? Why ? You think there 's something fishy with the fish ? Sorry . I guess we 've got other fish to fry . Stop it ! - David , what 's going on ? - I need to use your station . Okay . Why ? Oh ... What do you know about halibut , Bob ? They live at or near the bottom of the water and they prefer a temperature of 2 to 5 degrees Celsius . Okay . They can travel great distances . As a matter of fact , one was tagged and then found to have swam 2,500 miles . Ok , Thanks , Bob . - Or is it swum ? - Bob . You remember , about four years ago , that panel I was on , about GMO ... I disagreed with your decision . Yes , but not with the science . I mean , we found nothing to say that GMO fish were ... you know , gonna be the next great plague . You called me closed-minded and told me I wasn 't thinking about the future . And you hurt my feelings because you didn 't understand the point that I was trying to make ... - about the unknown ramifications . - Yeah , okay , look . The fish got bigger and faster and that 's all they were supposed to do . But was it necessary to genetically modify the fish ? Well , five years ago , up there in Fox Sound all the waters there had been fished out . There 's no work . So yeah , it was necessary ... - I wouldn 't say it was necessary . - The point I 'm trying to make ... is that they have been farming GMO fish in Fox Sound for the last four years . Pulling them out of the water by the ton every day . And I just want to make sure that this is the same GMO we approved . - Why would they be any different ? - Well for one thing , the fish that we tested were raised in confined little tanks , right ? Now they 're raising them in these great big undersea cages . You know what ? Could you just find out if there 's anything weird in this DNA , would you ? Could you ? Do you think you made a mistake ? - No . - So why are you doing this ? Because I just want to be ... - Because I just want to do it , okay ? - Whose blood is this , David ? Okay , a guy came to me because he thinks his little boy is crippled as a result of of all this mutant fish they 've been eating up there . And you think the fish ... - altered his DNA ? - I don 't know , Bob . I just want to take a look at it , alright . Okay ? Okay . David , you are feeling guilty about a decision you made years ago . No . It 's good that you feel guilty . You do your best work when you 're feeling guilty . There 's a one megabase inversion on chromosome 13 . Part of the little boy 's DNA is turned backwards . - What does that mean ? - Genetic abnormality ? Could be . Has this inversion ever been written up by anybody before ? Not that I know of . Is there a disease related to that part of our DNA ? I can look into it . - Okay . - It 'll take some time . Okay , we 're talking about a rare genetic disorder . You are going to have to look at the family 's DNA history . - It 's just the one little boy ? - So far . Well , what if there 's more ? Has anybody checked into that ? If there is more than one , it could still be genetic . Or not . I mean we 're talking about Fox Sound , it 's a little fishing village . They live off the sea . What if , you know , it 's something in the food chain ? What if the GMO fish are corrupting other species that we don 't even know about ? - What ? - You want to check every fish - and crustacean off the coast of Newfoundland ? - OK , not every one but ... Knock yourself out . I just think you 're wasting your time . What about the GMO halibut ? I checked its DNA against the wild halibut on the database . Only one significant change . What did they modify ? Just what they said they were going to modify . In the addition to the growth hormone gene , they added a strong promoter . No . Here , here . And they switched it " on " , suddenly the fish started pumping out growth hormone . Which is exactly what they were supposed to do . - Hi ! - Hi , quarantine girl . - Hey , Jill ! Hi ! - Hi Bob . Your welcome home dinner can now be served . Oh , thank you . Oh , hang on one sec . David .. Hi . - Hey ! - Dad ? - What 's for dinner ? - How did you get here ? - Cab . - By yourself ? Cab driver . Ah , right . Come in , come in . You met everybody . You know Mayko and Bob . - This is Jill Langston , Carlos Serrano . - It 's nice to meet you . - Come in . - Lamb shanks ! What I 'm saying is that most of the stuff isn 't even ... Okay , we don 't know what the effects of these foods would be on ... - Slow down ! - ... on the average person . - She 's got a point . - Thank you . Look , think about it , if we take a gene from an animal and splice it with what ... ? A tomato plant . - OK , that 's really a little extreme . - Will you let me finish , please ? No , look , we 've been eating GMO soybeans for years , right ? And corn . This little cotton shirt is probably genetically modified . None of us have six toes . David , you know that none of those studies have ever proven that GMOs are safe ! - Are you hiding an extra digit ? - Maybe . I 'll look later . The point is , there 's no evidence to suggest that GMOs are unsafe . - is what I 'm saying . - David , there is no evidence that thalidomide would harm fetuses . A safe morning sickness pill turned into a genetic nightmare . My point is , we don 't know for sure , okay ? We 're not going to know for sure for years ! You call yourself a scientist ? Your point is completely emotion-based . Mayko , biotech companies are about growing food , growing more nutritious food and at the same time , safeguarding the environment . Gracias amigo . GMOs are here to stay , they are the future . - That 's a load of horseshit . - Excuse me ? What you 're not considering is that this technology invariably goes where it wasn 't meant to . Dad , I consider that all the time , that 's my job . - Really then , you should know ... - Do your homework . that GMO fish escape from the farms and mate in the wild . - Yes ... - Pollen from GMO farms ... - drift to non-GMO crops . - Yes . Yes . That can happen - but there are safeguards- - - Okay , and also millions of dollars are spent lobbying the Drug and Food Administration to prevent the labelling of GMO foods . So if it 's so safe , then what are they trying to hide ? Because we are the guinea pigs in the biggest science experiment , ever . Oh , Jesus Christ . Okay , you know what , you 're right . You 're right . You 're absolutely right , it 's all one big conspiracy . And when I come back , I will regale you with the time the Grays kidnapped me and took me up to the mothership . Guinea pigs . Okay , I 'm sorry , I have to know . What was he like as a kid ? David ... emerged from the womb fully formed . He was arrogant , brilliant , charming . It 's taken him far and it 's held him back . He got it all from me . Let 's hope that 's all he gets from me . So , Megan ... - Oh ... Mayko . - Tell me ... how long have you and my son been married ? Hey , Earl Jordan ? Yeah , David Sandstrom . - Who ? - David Sandstrom . - You 're kidding . - Nope . - Listen , we did some tests . - I appreciate that , Doc . All I can tell you is that we didn 't find anything linking the GMO fish to your sons ' problems . No ... It 's gotta be the fish . It 's the only thing that 's changed up there in the last four years ... What can I tell you , Earl , we didn 't find anything . I have . My son . So ... what am I supposed to tell his mother , then ? You asked me to look into the GMOs and give you my opinion and I did , okay ? So that 's it then . You 're in the clear . Thanks for the call . Wait . Earl ? What your son does have is ... genetic irregularities . There 's a section of his DNA that seems to be turned around . Turned around ? Why ? How ? We don 't know . I mean ... That would take a lot more work . You 're looking into it ? Yeah , we 're looking into it . I appreciate it , Dr. Sandstrom . You know that . I do , Earl . I do . Yeah , I 'm looking for children who exhibit a palsy-like paralysis , but who remain undiagnosed . Well , if you know of anyone in any of the outports of the Burin Peninsula , could you let me know ? Yeah ... Any other symptoms ? Can you just send me everything you have ? Yeah , blood would be great . This is Mayko Tran from ... It sounds like you have your hands full . Yeah . I got your name from Dr. Moorhead ... Oh ! Okay good . Yeah . Well , I understand that ... Okay , so none of the kids have the exact same symptoms , and Earl 's kid has it the worst . But a lot of them seem to have muscle development problems . So I think I might have something here . But there are two others I want to check in on . Henry Harbour and Scott 's Bay . You want to tell me why this isn 't a wild goose chase ? OK , well if this is one in a million , you want to tell me why there are kids at either side of the same peninsula ? Some guy in San Francisco once won the lottery twice in one day . What about the rest of these kids , what if they have the genetic inversion ? What are the odds of that ? Okay , here 's what we need to do . Medical records on all the kids . - DNA from all the families . - It 'll be here tomorrow . And a lot more seafood . I got samples from the fishermen from all around the Fox Sound area . You are not giving up on this whole GMO link , are you ? David look , I checked into their dietary patterns , okay ? And on average 75 % of their food intake comes from the sea . Come on , don 't you think we should take another look at what they 're eating ? Absolutely . If there 's something in the food that 's causing all this we need to find out what it is . But it 's not the GMO fish . Ah ! New cologne , Wes ? - Does someone write those for you ? - No . You just inspire me . - Okay , so here 's what I got- - - Let 's get the whole gang in on this ... Wes , why don 't you be a doll , go round up the usual suspects , tell them to meet us in the conference room . Let me show you something . All department heads to the conference room please . That 's not half as much fun as watching you running around looking for people . It is for me . So what 's on the menu ? Okay ... I 've got lobster , cod , halibut , squid , mussels , snow crab , - human DNA- - - Everything but dessert . Come on . I 'm sorry , Caroline . But this seems to take priority - over the Appropriations Committee . - What happened ? Actually , it 's more about what 's happening . Last week ... a National Guard unit in Canton , Ohio , was doing a routine endurance course . These are troops ramping up for Iraq . Excellent condition . They all came down with the same symptoms . Double vision , upper body weakness , - muscle pain . - How many are we talking about ? 23 men . 7 women . They 're not responding to any treatment . I got an update just before you arrived . Five appear to be comatose . Any clue what we 're dealing with ? Homeland Security is hearing chatter . Credible threats by a group linked to Al-Qaeda . More or less to the effect they 're going to attack " America 's Heartland " . Okay , any evidence this is connected ? We have every reason to believe there is a cell operating in Ohio . - Any leads on that ? - We 're checking into it . Vigorously . FBI ! Put your hands where I can see them ! - What are you doing ? - Don 't move ! - What 's going on ? - Stay calm ! I can have my people working on this immediately . Good . I 'm not signing this . It 's just a standard release form absolving NorBAC of any responsibility for your accident . - Jill . - Yeah ? We 're waiting for you in the conference room . Okay , I 'll be right there . - Everything all right ? - Yeah , it 's fine . - ASAP . - Okay . It wasn 't an accident . An accident implies I made a mistake - and I did not make a mistake . - That 's not the general consensus . I don 't give a shit about the general consensus . - I did not fuck up . - Jill , what difference does it make ? Mistakes were made . You were exposed to an unknown retrovirus . I need you to sign these forms that NorBAC is not legally responsible . You think I 'm going to sue you ? I don 't know what you 're going to do , Jill . Jesus ! Wes , I 'll tell you what . I 'll sign those papers as soon as you start doing your job around here . - And what is that supposed to mean ? - That means : figure out why things are going missing . Find out who 's fucking around with my lab equipment . Actually manage the lab instead of covering your ass with release forms . - Jill ! - Save it . I got a meeting . Here . Here 's the background . Basically , we got a group of kids with muscle development problems . We 're looking into their family histories , DNA samples , all of that . When do you expect to receive them ? - It 's right here . - Ah ! OK . I 'll start running the DNA profiles on the new fish samples . - Bob , you do toxicology ? - I 'll run an Ames test , see what I can find . - Get Jill to help you do it . - Help you do what ? - Analyze the seafood for any toxins . - Okay . I 'm going to get an epidemiologist to look at what I have . OK , get these DNA samples to Scherer at Sick Kids . Everybody know what they 're doing ? - What are you doing ? - I got some catching up to do . - Jill ... - Sorry . Caroline . - What ? - Hey , David . There 'a military plane waiting for you at Downsview . Get there as soon as possible . Where am I going ? I can 't tell you . NATIONAL GUARD FACILITY , OHIO These guys aren 't fucking around , are they ? Full quarantine as of last week . This isn 't out to anyone , David . Next of keen , wives , parents of soldiers think they 're on a extended exercise . How many are we talking about ? Out of 32 members in the unit ... 30 are sick , 2 they don 't really know about . - What are they ? AWOL ? - They don 't really know . They haven 't reported to the base in two weeks . They sleep 24 / 7 . If we wake ' em , all they want to do is go back to sleep . Now some are slipping into comas . - Treatment ? - We 've tried everything . - Any success ? - Quiet , isn 't it ? OK , we 're going to need a full array of tests . Find out how contagious it is . If it 's airborne ? Waterborne ? - We 've already tried that , we got nothing . - Oh , shit . We 're going to have to take a look at everything you 've got . Absolutely , I 'll show you where you can work . Wait a minute , wait a minute . I 'd like to talk them if I could . By all means . Only ... there is only a few left who can talk to you . Sam ... Hi , Sam , I 'm David . Can you tell me how you 're feeling ? It 's so hot in the Bradley tank . Hot . Sam ? You 're still here . Where were you ? You said you were in a Bradley ? Desert ... Patrol ... - We ... - What desert ? It 's snowing , isn 't it ? Yeah ... Yeah , it 's snowing . So you just stay warm , okay ? You 'll be all right . Any of these soldiers have relatives or friends who are sick with the same thing ? No , only the guards have symptoms . Okay . We 're going to need a complete timetable of everything they did together . They were on manoeuvers . Not in contact with anyone but each other . Well , we 're going to have to find someone who knows what 's going on . Well , that 's the problem . There is only a few left conscious . Anyone who knows is lying in that room ! - Were these guys in Iraq ? - They weren 't . - Are they all hallucating like this ? - There 's some psychosis , yeah . Besides the psychosis , what have we got ? Couple of guys came complaining of headaches , - flu-like symptoms . - Fever ? Mild , but then there was blurred vision , weak upper body strength , severe muscle pains . What about their physical and mental responses ? Getting slower , then there was psychosis , then unconsciousness . It all happened pretty quickly . - How quickly ? - From perfect health to this ? Five days . So we ran DNA profiles on a variety of different species of the fish . No obvious abnormalities . So it 's possible that these kids ' chromosomal abnormalities are linked to inherited diseases . Okay , but we won 't know that for sure until I get the arrays from Sick Kids ' . Guys I got something . Bacterial counts for the fish . - Radiodurans ? - What ? There is a predominance of a particular species : - D. Radiodurans . - What are Radiodurans ? The cockroach of all bacteria . This shit 's going to be around when the sun swallows us up . They can fix themselves , even after being blasted with radioactivity . Doesn 't radioactivity kill most bacteria ? Exactly , so when you have an abundance of ' durans , and little or no other bacteria ... It could mean that there are high levels of radioactivity . - Got it , OK . - And radioactivity has been known to alter DNA , cause abnormalities . But only in high dosages , Bob . Let 's test the fish for radioactivity . Yeah . Trace amounts of radioactivity . - Where are the mussels from ? - Same area as the halibut . Off the coast of Port Big Horn . Okay , wait . So , why more radiation in the mussels ? Well , mussels are natural filters , trapping whatever passes through their bodies . See we have mussels from all over the peninsula . We should use them as our standard measuring tool , seeing where the concentrations are the highest . Okay , let 's do it . Okay . These are higher . Off the coast of St. Lawrence . It 's like a roadmap , pointing directly towards St. Pierre and Miquelon . Which , as you know , are part of France . Yes , thank you , Bob . Okay , look at this . These little symbols , right there . What are those ? - What do they stand for ? - Oil wells . When oil is dug up in the ocean , you get NORM . Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material . So could that be where the radiation originates from ? No , the radiation is too high . Okay , so what else ? I 'm not a specialist in nuclear biology but I 'd say we 'd have to be looking for something , - concentrations of- - - Oh shit , Bob . Are you saying that something was dumped there ? Okay , so who do we go after ? Who are the biggest shits in the nuclear world ? Russians ? Americans ? No . Oh , my God . French . Comatose soldiers . What do we got ? So I spoke with Gary Katz , at the Mayo Clinic . One of the best diagnosticians out there - and he didn 't have a clue . - Blood work ? The white blood cell count is sky high . Cytokines also way up there . The immune system is in overdrive . It 's definitely an infection . - Bacterial ? - I doubt it . What about virology ? Well we scanned for all known viruses : nothing . But here 's a weird one : we found what looked like weak hits on all the retroviruses . Can 't tell if it 's background or what ? Do you think something in the blood could be cross-reacting - with retroviruses on the array ? - Maybe . - Maybe you didn 't clean off the array very well . - True . All right . Let 's assume it 's a retrovirus . - Okay . - If it is , we might find a cause for this syndrome . So let 's keep looking at that angle . Thanks guys . - David , when are you coming back ? - Why , what 's up ? Well , we think we may have something on the problem in Newfoundland . What ? Radioactivity in the fish . Bob and Mayko think they have a line on where it 's coming from . Enough to cause damage to the genetic code ? You 're gonna have to convince me of that one guys . We 're working on it . All right , I 'll be back tonight . - Ready to go ? - Yeah , let 's do it . - You don 't have any food ! - Jesus ! Shit , Dad . You know , don 't be surprised if they put a bolt on your door . What you got there ? I went looking for matches . I found this in your desk . You know , it 's funny ... I can get lost between my suite and the dining hall . I memorized this piece of paper in ... ten minutes . You know what it says ? I already know . " To Dad . I am taking Mom someplace better so you can never make her feel bad again . You treat us like a big monster . You breathe fire ... that hurts us . I want to pick up a big sword and cut your head off . But I don 't have one , so goodbye . I hate you . From David . " What did I do ? It doesn 't matter anymore . I was such a selfish prick . It was always about me . I never thought anything else mattered . I miss your mother . Me too , Dad . I wish it could have been me instead . I 'm glad you 're here , Dad . I have Alzheimer 's disease . I know . I don 't want it . I don 't want to just fade away ... as somebody no one recognizes . I don 't want you to have it either . From perfect health to this . Getting slower ... There 's some psychosis . They came complaining of headaches , flu-like symptoms . It all happened pretty quickly . There was blurred vision , weak upper body strength , severe muscle pain , unconsciousness . Fuck , go away . Can 't you at least say please ? This thing is driving me crazy . Everybody says there 's no such disease . But I have seen this somewhere before . Two of the soldiers flatlined last night . They got ' em back but it 's not looking good . I 'm working on it , Caroline . You 're not helping . Yeah , you 're working on it but what 's your staff doing ? - They 're on it . - What does a map of Newfoundland and a bunch of fish have to do with 30 sick National Guardsmen ? Ah , fuck . What , Bob ? I know you 're thinking and busy , but do you just have a minute for the other thing ? A minute is about all you have , David . Look , I told you about this in your office . No , we said we 'd talk about it later . Well , I 've had my mind on other things . Talk to me now . I 'll be right there , Bob . I was looking into GMO fish , to see if they were fucking people up ! - And ? - They 're not . We don 't know what it is . I 'm still looking . Tell your staff this is going on the back burner . Why don 't we tell them together ? Sure . Greenpeace had it all . Well we 're going to have to put it on hold for a while . Put it on hold , that doesn 't make any sense . We know where the nuclear rods are , we need to get them out of there before- - Bob , we 've got more important things to think about right now . I would say a completely contaminated food chain is kind of important to deal with , David . - Yeah , well , Mayko . - Mayko 's got a point . You really want us to stop working on this . Caroline ? Okay , I 'll make some calls . I 'll make the French aware of the problem , ask them to clean up after themselves and then ... then we refocus . It 's not that simple . There was a territorial dispute with France over the islands and the Canadians took it to an arbitration panel . So in 1992 , Canada won the territorial waters where the French dumped the fuel rods . The French won 't clean up something that isn 't in their waters . Okay , I 'll deal with it ... I 'll deal with it , and I want you all to deal with an immobilized National Guard unit . - Caroline , we can 't do both . - I know you can 't , David . But just think what you can do if you focused on one thing . Right . You 're absolutely right . Thank you . Good work , guys . Okay , here 's the deal . I don 't think we 've got enough radiation to cause what we 're talking about here and if we did have enough radiation , why isn 't everyone showing the same symptoms , you know ? Why isn 't everyone showing signs of radiation sickness ? Nausea , exhaustion , hair loss . You 're right . You 've got to look at the symptoms . The symptoms don 't lie . The symptoms , shit ! - Jill ! - Yeah ? I need your brain on this National Guardmen 's thing for a second . - OK . What 's up ? - Symptoms , OK , we just keep an open mind , but we got headaches , flu-like symptoms , mild fever . That turns into muscle pain , slow physical and mental responses , sleepiness , right ? - Okay . - Sleepiness into coma . - Coma ? - Yeah ... Encephalitis Lethargica ? Highly contagious . Over 5 million people got it , no one ever figured it out . No . David , it hasn 't been around since 1928 . Spanish flu hadn 't been around for a long time , either . If Al Qaeda 's got it and you 're right ... We 're screwed . Subtitles : kubilai , Lama , Teuteu42 Yes , Sir . It 's Wes . I see . I will . Yes , Sir . - Is that the DNA for the National Guard ? - No , for the Newfoundland families . I thought we were finished with that ? Apparently not . So , the fish couldn 't have caused a genetic mutation . - No . - And the nuclear rods were dumped in the 1950s ? So the radiation didn 't cause any damage either . I believe this meeting is called : " the Ohio virus " . Guardsmen . They 're getting better . - What ? - What , you 've got the cure ? I do , indeed . I just don 't know what it was we did cure . I would really love to take a look at what 's in that vial . Can you get up here ? I am just as interested in this as you are , Doctor . - I can be up there tomorrow . - Great , I 'll see you then . David , I 'm having a hard time finding Henshaw . The guy has a cure for Lethargica , Wes . Just find him . - Something strange is going on . - And that is ? We keep getting hits on the same piece of DNA . It looks harmless , but all the Guardsmen , their bodies are producing the same obscure DNA fragment over and over again . Altered ? - You mean weaponized ? - They make the perfect weapon . Something we 've ignored for the better part of a century . Something we haven 't got a clue how to fight . Things are getting a little tense inside the lab . Everyone 's working hard . So make sure you log in for this week 's mission . I 'm counting on you . And remember : only you know the whole story .

 MILLY : ' Tracy Beaker , shut your big , fat gob ! ' # I can make my world come true All my dreams will see my through # And the fight won 't get me down No ! No ! # My dreams will turn things All around # With a smile upon my face I can see a better place # It doesn 't matter What may come my way ... No ! No ! # Believe me now I will win some day . # It 's been five months since we saw Ashley . 'I have a comprehensive genetic match . ' What ? ' Luke and Ashley Stafford are the same person . ' Why can 't I remember them ? Ashley , thank God . Children have no place in my life . You don 't mean that . Go home . Mitre . Who developed it ? You told her about Mitre ? Those headsets take the latent raw psychic ability all humans possess to move objects with the power of thought , and directs it . Mr Smith , are you asking me to go back to Pharos and steal a headset ? It would be of great assistance . We 'll see about that . It 's Luke with the pair who reckon he 's their kid . I think it 's a fake . Xylos , are you there ? You 're right Clyde , I faked it . EVIL GROANING You 're Slitheen ? Aagh ! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA ! BUZZING BANGING NOISE BUZZING BUZZING RADIO CRACKLE SIREN BLARES 'Intruder ! Perimeter defences have been armed . 'Any attempt to escape may result in death . 'You have been warned ! ' Noted . Hope that didn 't sting too much . GROANING 'This is Clyde . If you want me - and I don 't blame you - leave me your number , specially if you 're cute . Clyde ! What 's going on ? Ring me back ! Where are you ? Hello , hello ! Anyone ? Where am I ? Where am I ? Just a clue ? At least I 'm still alive . I think . No Mrs Langer , I haven 't seen him . Don 't worry , I 'm sure he 's stayed at a mate 's . If I see him , I 'll tell him to ring you , OK ? Something wrong ? Clyde 's not answering and he didn 't go home last night . When did you last see him ? Lunchtime yesterday . He skipped school to see Luke . He rang me later . He says he doesn 't think they 're really Luke 's parents . I know I 'm new to this X-Files stuff , but isn 't it more likely that Luke is a normal boy who lost his memory rather than Frankenstein Junior made by these aliens , The Bean . The Bane , and Clyde thought he had proof that these people are fakes . What ? Fake parents or fake people ? Maybe both . What if they 've done something to Clyde ? His mother must be going out of her mind . I 've got to go and look for him . No you don 't . I 'm part of this now . I 'm coming with you . If I was an alien bent on invasion , I 'd choose a palace rather than this place . They 're not in . Come on . Where ? If the house is empty , it 's our chance to find out about them . Maria ! Come on Dad , there may be a window round the back . Housebreaking , great ! Your mother was right about you hanging out with Sarah Jane . Just keep quiet , Dad . And start looking . What are we looking for ? Who they are , or what they 've done with Luke and Clyde . Who they are , what they 've done with Luke ... Oh ! They 've skinned someone ! They 're cannibals ! They 're not cannibals . They 're Slitheen . Where are you taking me ? " Where are you taking me ? Why take revenge ? " Why are children full of stupid questions ? You 're a child . I 'm Slitheen , you will give me my revenge . I don 't want to do that . Should be doing this ? The Xylok said we should wait ? Are you questioning my authority ? You 'd trust a Xylok , Dak Fex Fize ? You 're as thick as a human . What 's a Xylok ? See what I mean ? THEY LAUGH This is looking distinctly un-cool , Clyde . No way in and no way out and no-one to tell me what the hell 's going on ! 'I can tell you . ' Mr Smith ? Where are you ? 'Surely the relevant question , Clyde , is where are you ? ' Hold on , you 've gone bad . You zapped me . 'I haven 't gone bad , I 'm fulfilling my purpose . ' Which is to zap me into where , exactly ? 'This will have to wait , but we can chat later , 'it will pass the last few hours before you all die . ' Before ... what ? Mr Smith , I need you ! 'You called me , Sarah Jane . ' Holy Joe ! Mr Smith 's going to kill us , and I 'm inside him ! I got the headset . 'It will be of great assistance . ' No ! Sarah Jane ! Can you hear me ? He 's the bad guy ! 'I will let you have my conclusion in due course . 'Assessing . ' This does not sound good at all . You 've got to do something . Think ! You 're inside a computer ... what can you do ? We have to tell Sarah Jane . That you 've got a kitten to replace the boy she kidnapped ? I don 't remember giving you a key . You didn 't lock the door . Lucky I came by . Computer 's making a noise . I 'd better look at it . Would you pop to the shop , get some teabags ? Sure . Won 't be long . Will she be OK with the child-snatching maniac around ? Yes ! She can look after herself . Sarah Jane 's not a child-snatcher , or a maniac . Come on . What are you doing ? More stupid questions . I told you , I don 't want you here . They 're not Luke 's parents . They 're Slitheen ! Hello Nathan . What are you doing here on a Saturday afternoon ? Aaagh ! Aaagh ! Aaaagh ! Go ! He 'll be out cold for hours , by then it will all be over . You can 't just go out and leave things on , Alan . It 's a fire hazard . Look at it . It 's not supposed to do that . Well , I can 't hang around . Ivan 's taking me shopping . Oh , make sure you keep Maria away from her over the road . Sooner she 's locked up , the better ! Yeah . Sure . It 's always your trouble , Alan . Work . Don 't worry , let myself out . Mr Smith , we need you . 'You called , Sarah Jane . ' Do you know of any Slitheen activity on Earth ? 'Slitheen ? Why do you ask ? ' You got it wrong ! They weren 't Luke 's parents . They 're Slitheen ! 'Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! ' Mr Smith ? 'Humans . So inevitably predictable . ' Get out now ! Mr Smith is one of the bad guys ! Don 't be ridiculous . Who told you those people were Luke 's parents ? Mr Smith ? What 's going on ? ' I have a Purpose . It must be fulfilled . 'The Slitheen have been useful . 'And so have you . But you are no longer required . ' Get down ! 'Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! ' Let 's get out of here . I trusted him with my life , with the whole planet . What 's happened to him ? Some kind of computer virus ? Maybe Clyde can tell us . Clyde ? Yeah . Come on . 'Now this is refreshingly unpredictable . 'Communicating with Mr Jackson 's computer . 'Well done , Clyde . You 're not as stupid as you pretend , are you ? ' When it comes to pretending , you take the biscuit . We thought you were on our side . 'I 'm a Xylok . I 'm not on anybody 's side . 'I have my Purpose . 'As for your interference , it is of minimal inconvenience . 'Sarah Jane can 't stop me achieving that Purpose . 'And soon you will play your part in it . 'But now your communications are terminated . ' COMPUTER SOUNDS CRASH It wasn 't on-line messaging . He was just there . He 'd ... hacked in ? I 've never seen anything like it . We have to find out what 's going on . Does Mr Smith has anything to do with Luke and the Slitheen ? He must have . But how ? Could Mr Smith have some connection with the Slitheen ? Where did he come from ? The biggest volcanic eruption civilization has ever seen . 18 months ago , when I was researching volcanic activity , a geologist friend sent me a crystal from the site of Krakatoa . The crystal had become a curiosity among geologists . They 'd never seen anything like it . Neither had I. But they didn 't see what I did . It was as if the crystal was communicating with my laptop and using it to communicate with me . It was a cell from a space craft that crashed millions of years ago . Its computing power , its knowledge , it was phenomenal . It told me amazing things . It said it could help track alien life coming to Earth , could protect the Earth , but our technology was limited . And so it designed , and it created ... .. Mr Smith . So why , after all this time , turn against you ? We 'll work it out as we go . We have to find Luke . I gave him to the Slitheen . Whatever they want , I have to get him back . They want to use him to invade ? The Slitheen don 't invade . They 're not a race . They 're scavengers . It 's Only Fools and Horses with claws . They 're dealers , they sell anything and in some parts , telekinetic energy fetches a huge price . They could have got plans for the energizer from across the galaxy , had it built at the Pharos . I knew I didn 't care for Nathan . Telekinetic energy ? Moving things with your mind ? Luke 's mind . Created by the Bane . The most incredible mind on the planet . If the Slitheen harness it , Luke 's telekinetic powers could be massive . So they bottle it and sell it ? What happens to Luke ? If they take it all - and they never leave anything behind that they can sell - Luke will die . We have to find him , and I know where to look ! Have you got any vinegar ? No , we 're all out . Then we may have to stop off at a chip shop . Go ! MANIC LAUGHTER Whatever you want , I 'll fight you . Love it . The more brain activity , the faster we harvest the telekinetic energy . And we want it all . Every spark from every synapse . Until you 're dead . EVIL GIGGLING We 're all set here . Then let 's energize ! It 's working ! He 's filled up two storage tanks already . I 've never seen so much energy , we 're going to be rich ! He 's a telekinetic power station ! We 'll have a supernova of a holiday this year , Bloorm Vungah Bart ! Oh , Dak Fex Fize ! Look out , he 's overloading the system ! What 's happening ? Bloorm Vungah Bart ! He 's using his own telekinetic energy ! He 's getting away ! Nazdracks to the profit . I 'll have my revenge warm and dripping ! I 'm coming , Luke ! I can smell your fear , Luke . Yes , Luke run , run . Never mind phasers or photon torpedoes . Never mind Arnie 's Uzi 9 mm . We 're taking on aliens with vinegar ? It 's acetic acid . Slitheen are calcium . Calcium and acetic acid don 't mix . Trust me . Sure , why not ? Aah , revenge at last , Luke , I 'm going to enjoy this kill . This is for my father ! You slippery ... the same blood that made you . What happened here ? With a little luck , Luke did . Oh , oh , oh ! Oh , my head ! Oh , my ... I 'm armed . What 's going on ? What have you done with my son ? The misbehaving little brat ? Back on Raxacoricofallapatorius , we 'd spank him with a Bartleboigle tree . We 're not there . Where is he ? He got away . That doesn 't matter . Leave her alone ! You killed my father , Sarah Jane Smith . At the school . Use your sonic device open the door , open the door ! Aaaaagh ! You were the child ? I didn 't want you to die . But you were going to kill our planet . Get away from my daughter , you overgrown newt ! No . You drop your weapon . Or she dies . Now let her go , frog face . Dad ! . What now ? Now we contact the Xylok . Get this deal back on the rails . Once we 've found the youngling again . The Xylok ? You know him as Mr Smith . Why would Mr Smith make a deal with you ? He contacted us . He said he had seen what you did to my family . He wanted to help us get revenge . If that was what he wanted , why did he send me here to find the energizer ? He sent you here ? It 's all been part of his plan . He brought you to Earth to build the telekinetic energizer . He told me to come here looking for it . I don 't understand . Neither do I. Not yet . But the last part of his plan has just fallen into place . Mr Smith knew Luke would escape and he knew that , when he did , he would run straight back to my house . Right back to him . Sarah Jane ! Sarah Jane ! 'Luke ! Up here , Luke . ' What does Mr Smith want with Luke ? Luke . And the telekinetic energizer headset . Mr Smith had me steal one of them , the prototype 's in my attic . I don 't care . I 'll deal with the Xylok later . We don 't need him for revenge ! If you kill us , you won 't stop Mr Smith , or get off this planet . Save your breath . You 'll need it for screaming . Get off ! Let me go ! She 's my kill ! A claw for a claw ! When you 're older , you 'll learn not to make snap decisions . Now what do you mean ? Something Mr Smith said about the energizer . With the right mind , it could destroy worlds . He meant Luke 's mind . I think he 's planning to destroy the Earth . 'Come in , Luke . ' Where 's Sarah Jane ? 'She left something for you . 'Put it on , Luke . ' No . 'There really isn 't time to argue . ' Clyde ? ' Put it on or I will kill him . ' But ... you 're ... 'Running out of time and patience . 'Put the headset on . Now ! 'That 's more like it . 'At last , we can begin . ' ZAPPING NOISE Aaaaaagh ! URGENT BLEEPING What 's that ? MITRE ... it 's gone on-line . Mr Smith . He 's using the headset on Luke . Massive telekinetic levels . They 're off the scale . EXPLOSION What the ... ? The moon ! It 's moving ! It 's not possible . Luke isn 't possible . Mr Smith isn 't possible . But they 're bringing the moon crashing down on Earth . But it 's a quarter of a million miles away . We 'll be dead long before it hits us . The gravitational effect will tear the planet apart . It 's happening . At least I 'll be able to tell my family you 're dead , Sarah Jane Smith . I 'm teleporting back to the ship . You 're not ! You 're as much to blame as Mr Smith ! You 're staying . Your ship would be torn apart by gravitational disturbance . On the other hand , if you help me , we might all just have one chance to survive . I need you to destroy Mr Smith . 'Give me more kinetic . Let the universe witness the power . 'Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! ' 'The moon is heading to earth , causing 'spontaneous forest fires , indeed we have had reports of avalanche , 'freak storms and indeed tidal waves . 'As this continues , it becomes more .. ' PHONE RINGS Chrissie ? Alan , where are you ? It 's the end of the world ! Chrissie , calm down . Calm down ! ? Alan , I need to be with you , you and Maria ... Alan ! Chrissie ? Chrissie . The phone line 's gone . We 're almost out of time , Alan . I get paid by companies to block cyber-threats . I understand viruses , how they work . But Mr Smith ... he 's more than a computer . Dad , you 're our only chance . Well , then this is my best shot . The FBI have stopped a cyber-terrorist from using this to destroy the entire international banking network . How did you get hold of it ? You 're not the only one with unorthodox contacts . Time to show me how this works . The United Nations is in emergency session to discuss this apocalyptic crisis . Luke ! 'Sarah Jane . You came to say goodbye . ' Why are you doing this ? 'The collision will release the Xylok from beneath the planet 's crust 'where it has been buried for 60 million years . ' You 're going to kill billions . 'The Xylok are a crystalline life form . 'We crashed here as a meteorite . 'But buried beneath the Earth , 'our crystals have become strong again , but remain trapped . ' The original crystal ... You 're in contact with it ? 'The release of the Xylok is my Purpose . 'You gave me the chance to fulfil it . The chance to plan . ' All this time , you used me ? Mr Smith , you 're evil . No . Effective . 'We will do much more than the human race . 'The universe is served better by our survival . ' Any race thinking it 's better than another , that 's evil . 'I am not evil . ' So what have you done with Clyde ? 'Am I not merciful ? ' What a dream . 'You made all this possible , Sarah Jane . 'I owe you the mercy of a quick death . ' And the others . Don 't they deserve mercy ? You 've been here millions of years . You 've seen us evolve . Don 't we matter ? 'Only my Purpose matters . ' You can change your purpose . 'No . I told you , Sarah Jane , 'we all have a purpose . 'Yours is to die so that the Xylok will live . 'After all , what life do you have , alone in your attic ? ' You think I 'm alone ? You think I 'm defenceless ? Well , meet my dog ! K9 , protect me ! Affirmative , Mistress . Maximum defence mode . Take care , Mistress and you young Master . Safe to proceed Mistress , I have the unit covered . Do you wish me to continue firing , Mistress ? Just be ready if I need you , K9 . Very good , Mistress . A robot dog . Called K9 ? Affirmative . I am dreaming , aren 't I ? 'What have you done to me , Sarah Jane ? 'I feel ... I feel strange . ' A computer virus . It 's closing your databanks . You 're losing memory . 'The speed of light is thirty-six , no , eighty-four ... 'The Metrabeelen Cosmic Cluster is home 'to 68 thousand lifeforms ... 67 ... 'I 'm forgetting it all . Sarah Jane ! Help me ! ' Without memories , you have no Purpose . Without Purpose , you can 't destroy the Earth . Put the moon into its original orbit and set Luke free . 'I 've forgotten my Purpose ! ' To save the Earth . That is your new Purpose . To save the Earth . 'Save the Earth . Yes . 'I have a Purpose . Thank you , Sarah Jane . ' The unit is non-functional . He did it ! It worked , the moon 's going back ! Is everything satisfactory , Mistress ? Affirmative , K9 . Must return to the distortion , Mistress . Without my attention , black hole will turn critical in 0.4 ti2me spatial increments . Go now . Good dog . I 'll see you again soon . Mum ? Oh , Luke . 'I 've seen amazing things out there in space . 'But strange things can happen wherever you are . ' There they go . Back to Raxacoricofallapatorius . And good riddance . Will they be back ? Oh , I expect so . Sooner or later . What about Mr Smith ? Can we trust him again ? The Armageddon Code wiped his circuits . He 'll re-boot with a new purpose ... to safeguard the world . Mum ! We were just saying what a beautiful night , please come and join us . 'I have learnt that life on earth can be an adventure too , 'you never know you might find . 'In all the universe , I never expected to find a family . ' Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd

 Hey , you ! Stay there ! Stop ! - Get after him ! - Yeah , shout at him , brilliant ! - You found anything ? - Got it ! In there ! Stop ! Please ! I can help you ! Please ! It 's okay . You 're safe . You 're safe ! A time fissure . We 're staring into time . It 's beautiful . That poor boy must have wandered in and ended up here . It 's happened before . Missing people , lost in time . But if we stepped through there , we could travel in time . Amazing ! Uh-uh ! It 's not safe . We 'll send the kid home . I 'll use the converter to reduce the energy ratio and close the gap . Like a time puncture repair kit ? Yeah . Exactly like . - Sarah Jane ! We got him . - What 's going on ? Don 't worry , everything 's going to be all right . - Hello . What 's your name ? - Oscar . Who are you lot ? - Where am I ? - Don 't worry about that . You 're going home , Oscar . Just step through . You 'll be safe . There 's nothing to be scared of . - Go through . I promise you 'll be safe . - No . - I 'm scared . - Luke . Come on , it 's all going to be fine . I promise you . Back in two ticks . And this is home , yes ? Yes . I was just going for a walk , suddenly I was in that strange place . Forget it ever happened . Forget me . Okay ? No . No , it can 't be . - What 's the name of that place ? - Foxgrove . It 's where I live . What year is this ? Please tell me the date . It 's 1 951 . July 1 951 . No ! Go , go , go ! No . Oh , no , you don 't , Sarah Jane Smith . Did I do it properly , sir ? You did it beautifully . Soon , I will do battle once more with Sarah Jane Smith . She will return here , the one time and place that she cannot resist . And this time , the triumph shall be mine ! ( LAUGHING ) - How did it go ? - Just fine . I sent Oscar home . - What about you ? How are you ? - Fine . Why shouldn 't I be ? What 's on the other side of that ? Yeah , what was it like ? Did you see anything ? Nothing much . This place used to be countryside . Right , better close it up . We could go through there into another time . We might never get the chance again . Can 't we just have a look ? Five minutes ? No . I 'm sorry , Clyde . But it 's too dangerous . You go back , change one tiny thing , it has terrible consequences . But you 've traveled through time in the TARDIS . With the Doctor who knew what he was doing , most of the time . This is different and I 'm closing it up forever . Job done . Let 's go home . - Bye , Sarah Jane . - Yeah . - See you tomorrow ? - Bye , Rani . She 's no good at hiding how she feels , is she ? She said she was fine . She spent the whole ride not saying anything . She didn 't even complain when Steve Wright was on the radio . Not even when he played the Hoosiers . Something happened when she went back in time . And it 's up to you to find out the whole story . Ciao . MR. SMITH : The energy spike registers minimal activity , Sarah Jane . - The fissure is no longer active . - Thank you , Mr. Smith . Can you give me the details of the area over the last century ? In particular , a village called Foxgrove . The village of Foxgrove was sited here . It was mainly noted for the ruins of a Cistercian abbey . The entire village was demolished in 1 964 to make way for an A road . The area comprises housing on the edges of Broughton New Town . It 's right there . Oh , why didn 't I realize ? I 'm sorry , Sarah Jane , I don 't understand your question . - I was talking to myself . - I see . Sorry I spoke . Forgive me , but is there anything else I can help you with ? - No , thanks . - Are you sure ? Positive ! Goodbye for now ! Oh , no , you don 't , my girl . I can 't . I mustn 't . And I won 't . Mum ? What 's the matter ? I 'm fine ! Why is everybody asking if there 's anything wrong ? Rani , you , even the computer . I 've gotta say , Mum , you 're very unconvincing . Oh ! It 's that bad ? Oh , Luke , I 'm sorry . Who are they ? Barbara and Eddie Smith . My mum and dad . They died when you were just a baby . What exactly happened ? We lived in a village called Foxgrove . That 's where I was born . One afternoon , in August 1 951 , they got in their car and they never came back . There was an accident ? A tractor had broken down in the lane . They went straight into it . You got out okay . I wasn 't with them . They left me behind , in my pram , at the side of the road , alone . They must have had a reason . To leave a three-month-old baby on its own ? So your Aunt Lavinia brought you up ? Dad 's sister , the family genius . She did the best she could . But she was always so busy . She always said my mum and dad were the best parents in the world . But I couldn 't help thinking , " Was she covering up for them ? " Because that day they just upped and left their baby alone . Left me behind . - Where were they going in the car ? - Nobody knew . They just took off . I 've never told anybody this . Not even the Doctor . All these years , I 've tried to pretend it didn 't matter . And then , today , we found that time fissure . It leads right there to Foxgrove , July 1 951 , a month before they died . I actually saw the village . - My mum and dad , they 're down there . - You want to go back . Well , why not ? Just for a moment , just to see them ? I can 't ! Stepping back in time into your own past is so dangerous . And think about it . It 's all too convenient . - It could be a trap . - Or a coincidence . No , it must be a trap , which is another reason for not going . Somebody 's been very clever , but not clever enough . They 've put the idea in my head , but I 'm strong enough to say no . I must be out of my mind . Mum , I know where you 're going and I 'm coming with you . No , I won 't let you risk it . I just want to make sure you 're all right . Oh , Luke . Not a school night either , is it ? Straight there , straight back and we won 't tell anybody . - Where did you get the clothes ? - Back of my wardrobe . Simple , classic , it 'll do the job . You used to wear that ? Seriously ? Listen , kid , the ' 50s came back in the ' 70s . I remember when this was quite the thing . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) I can still change my mind . I can still walk away . I could meet myself as a baby . That 's so dangerous . If I touched her , there could be a huge explosion . But you know that , so you won 't . It 's your choice . It 's only dangerous if you change something . And you 're not going to . - What would you do ? - I 'd go . Any normal person would . I think even I 'm normal enough to know that . And if it is a trap , this is the only way to find out who 's behind it . That sounds like a good , rational reason I can give myself anyway . There you go . Thank you . You know something ? You 're brilliant . The fissure should stay open for about an hour , but I 'll be back before then . Mum , it 's closing . No ! Mum ! ( LAUGHING ) The trap is closing . Luke ! What on earth are you doing ? I had to come through . I had no choice ! - It 's gone , Mum . - Don 't panic . Give me the converter . It 's okay . Time fissures , they can be erratic . But it 's still active , I can open it again . We can get back . We 're back in time . 1 951 . It 's incredible . It 's daytime ! That 's time travel . Jet lag you wouldn 't believe . LUKE : The village . You should go back . Mind you , every time I use this , it weakens the link . Now you 're here , you might as well come with me . LUKE : Is that okay ? You 're part of the family , too , aren 't you ? She did it . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Come on . Luke ! Lukey-boy ! Rani ! Rani ! RANI : Mum , it 's a Saturday ! - You 've got a visitor . - RANI : What ? I 'm having a lie-in ! Can 't keep trouble away . Good job your dad didn 't see him . Their phones are off and me and Luke are meeting up . He never , ever forgets . I tell you , my Clydey sense is tingling . - They might 've just gone out . - Or what if Sarah Jane 's been grabbed ? Right . We 'll make a list of all her enemies . Great idea . Shouldn 't take us more than 1 5 years . Mr. Smith , I need you ! - Where are Sarah Jane and Luke ? - MR . SMITH : I have no information . Come on , did she say where they 've gone ? No , Rani . She did not . See ! That 's weird . What if it 's aliens ? They could be being probed right now . There are no signs of alien activity . In fact ... In fact what ? Spit it out . It is not my function to venture opinion or to prognosticate the behavior of humans . But I have a theory about where they 've gone . Or rather , when . Didn 't like how that sentence ended up . Mr. Smith , give us your theory . Sarah Jane was born here , in the village of Foxgrove . She lived there as a baby in the period to which the fissure leads . Her mum and dad ! They were alive then . - She 's gone back to see them . - Whoa ! Obvious trap ! Like if it was you , you wouldn 't go ? Information . Energy pulse detected . - Energy pulse ? Where ? - Behind you . ( BEEPING ) Oh , no . Bad news . Tell me . Last year , some really weird stuff went down . I never got my head round it . But some alien thing took Sarah Jane out of time completely . But Maria could still remember her because she had this box . It protects you against some other alien , the Graske . And bad time things in general . How does it protect you ? I don 't know . With its boxy goodness ? We can remember Sarah Jane and Luke , nothing 's changed . Something 's making it flash though . We 've gotta get after them , warn them . She 'll have taken the converter . We can 't get through the fissure . We can try and that might help us . It 's only half an hour on the train . Nobody about . Look , they must be down there . Come on then . I just want to see them , that 's all . I know . Me , too . But , Luke , they abandoned me . What kind of people are they ? - Do I really want to know the answer ? - You can 't turn back now . MRS. KING : Everybody , could I have your attention , please ? The raffle prizes will be announced at 5 : 00 sharp . Thank you ! LUKE : These people , they look so excited . SARAH JANE : It 's 1 951 . They 're still on rations after the war . No mobile phones , no TV . I see . This is what old people call making your own entertainment . BARBARA : Sarah Jane ! Look what mummy 's got for you , Sarah Jane . It 's her , my mum . ( BABY CRYING ) Sarah Jane . - And that must be ... - I know . Me . Looks like a pretty good mum . - So why did she leave me ? - You can hardly go up and ask . - I can if I 'm careful . - That wasn 't the plan . - You wanted to see her . Now you have . - Plans change . It 's her . My mum . - Hello . - Oh , hello . Sorry . I thought you were ... I thought I knew you . Oh , that 's all right . Lovely baby . Yeah , thanks , she is . Come on . Guess how many gobstoppers in there , penny a go . I 'd say it was 676 . - You what ? What did you say ? - 676 . If you take the cubic volume of the jar , then divide by the size of each sweet , allowing for the approximate spaces in between . Just put your name down there . You from abroad ? No . We 're from London . What 's she called ? Sarah Jane . - You look like you adore her . - Yeah . Eddie ! Made it eventually then ? Oh , had to leave the car up by the memorial . - Hello . - Hello , strangers . Welcome to the village fete . Fate worse than death ! You staying over the pub ? No , just passing through . A little holiday . Oh , well , lovely day for it . - Eddie Smith . - I 'm Victoria Beckham . - And I 'm David Beckham . - Nice to meet you . I 'm Barbara . How 's my little darling ? - BARBARA : Quiet as a lamb . - Beautiful , ain 't she ? Oh , can you help out in the tent ? They 're a bit shorthanded . - Go on , I 'll mind the stall . - Righty-ho . Bye-bye , bye-bye . - I 'll help out if you like . - No , that 's all right . - I like to make myself useful . - Mum , are you sure ? - We should be getting back soon . - Just a moment . - Okay . - Meet you back at the square . EDDIE : How many sweets in the jar ? Come on , lovely prizes , step up . Thank you so much , Mrs. Smith . We can always rely on you . That 's all right , Mrs. King . Where 's Mr. Beckham today then ? Your husband ? I 'm not married . - But David 's your son ? - I adopted him . You can adopt even if you 're on your own ? - I thought you couldn 't do that . - You going to have more kids ? A couple more . That 's always been the plan . Don 't want her growing up on her own , nobody to play with . Here , I was doing this when I first met Eddie . In a canteen or something ? The NAAFI , yeah . Eddie came in every afternoon , 3 : 00 on the dot , milky tea and a teacake . He used to leave me silly notes , " Miss Wilson , be mine . " " Miss Wilson , I adore you . " Then , one day , " Miss Wilson , will you be Mrs. Smith ? " So I sent one back , " Mr. Smith , I will " . We still do it , look . " Mrs. Smith , chips for tea , please . " You probably think we 're soft , Victoria . I don 't . I think it 's lovely . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) The fissure 's closed . Try the box . - What am I supposed to do ? - I don 't know . Hold it up . Hocus pocus ! Open sesame ! I don 't know . Jumanji ! - I feel like a right fool . - Look at that . It 's going crazy . It 's trying to tell us something . Watch out , here comes Madam . Look at her . So peaceful . What 's she thinking ? Thinking about her tea , I reckon . Eddie thinks she 's gonna turn out like his sister , - the brain of Britain . - I 'm sure she 'll turn out fine . You wonder sometimes though , don 't you , Victoria ? What kind of world is she gonna grow up in ? Russians and the Yanks letting off H-bombs left , right and center . All these men with big ideas on how to live your life . I think the future will be better than that . Well , that 's why we moved out here . You see our generation , we had all the upheaval , the danger . But Sarah Jane 's gonna have a better life . She 's the best little girl in the world . We 'll always be there for you , won 't we , darling ? I 'd better go . It was nice meeting you . No , it was incredible . Goodbye . She 's a funny one . Mum , it 's time to go home . Now . Yes . I 'll never know why they left me that day . But I do know that they loved me . I thought I 'd take this back to show Clyde and Rani . - A souvenir , if that 's okay ? - Why not ? No . - No , it can 't be . - What 's the matter ? Mum ? Today 's date . August the 1 8th . It 's the day they died . The boy , Oscar . He said it was July . Why would he lie ? They drive off today . They leave me today . This afternoon . - Now . - We 've got to go back home . There ! That 's the car . You heard him , my dad parked it by the memorial . We 're going home , now ! I could save them with the sonic . I could put the car out of action . Then wherever they were going , they 'd never leave . But it 's a fixed point in time . We know it happened . - But why ? Why them ? It 's so unfair ! - You know you can 't do it . Luke , I have saved the lives of so many people . People I didn 't even know . Miners on Peladon . All the people drinking Bubble Shock ! without a second thought . - But this is my mum and dad ! - You know you 're not meant to . Why not ? Why shouldn 't I save them , too ? What about the way you were brought up ? Then what if you never meet the Doctor ? What if you never meet me ? I only want to look through the fissure , see what my life becomes if they survive . If there 's anything wrong , we set it right again . Unless this is the trap ! Why do we have to think this is something terrible ? All these years I 've been putting other people first . There has to be something at the end of it . What if this is it ? My reward ? - Please . Stop for a moment . Think . - If I do , I 'll change my mind . I 've disabled the engine , now they can 't go anywhere . You always said changing time was so dangerous . Back to the fissure . Now ! Maybe the whole world will be better . It 's just an experiment . I have to see . ( RUMBLING ) - WOMAN 1 : I won ! - WOMAN 2 : No , I did ! ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) - Weather 's turning . - Forecast said sunny all day . One day , they 'll get it right . But there 's no clouds , that 's weird . It 's happening . Time for me to collect my prize . Why has it turned red ? What ? I don 't like this at all ! - It 's Luke ! Luke ! - No ! It 's not him . It 's that kid , Oscar . Oscar , what 's wrong ? Where 's Sarah Jane , the lady who helped you ? So stupid . Humans . I really don 't like where that sentence ended up either . ( LAUGHING ) Run ! Let 's split up ! It must be the Graske thing and that 'll protect us . Let 's not split up . Here ! Something 's happening . Hold on to me ! ( BOTH SCREAMING ) I can 't see anything . What 's happened ? - I 'm going through . - Wait for me ! This is our time . Our world . That 's impossible . What 's happened to London ? It 's been destroyed ! ( CONTINUE SCREAMING ) What just happened ? Where are we ? ( MANIACAL LAUGHING ) Sarah Jane Smith ! - Oh , no . Not you . - Mum , what is it ? - Where is this place ? - This is what you wanted to see . Earth , on the day that you left ! Do you consider your experiment to be a success ? - What have you done ? - It was you ! You gave me the power to walk this world . You gave this planet to the Trickster . ( LAUGHING ) - We saw the Trickster in the future . - But he hasn 't manifested himself yet . That 's about to happen here in 1 95 1 . We 're in an alternative timeline . Our world never existed . The Trickster walked through the Abbot 's Gateway and sucked the life out of the world . too late. i 'm growing stronger !

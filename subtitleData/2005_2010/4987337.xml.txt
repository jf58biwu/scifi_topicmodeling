 Previously on Heroes . Camera 's ready for whatever . What are you doing ? Oh , my God . When we embrace what lies within , our potential has no limit . And as far as you know , that was attempt number one . The future is filled with promise , the present rife with expectation . But when we deny our instinct , and struggle against our deepest urges ... Are you on the list ? ... uncertainty begins . My dad obviously doesn 't work in a paper factory . I don 't know what he does . Go ! Go ! Go ! Where is he ? Where 's Sylar ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . Where does this path lead ? I have no idea how you 're pulling this off , but I swear to God , I 'm not going to stop until I figure it out . You understand me ? When will the changes end ? Is this transformation a gift ... I just wanted to see my son . ... or a curse ? You don 't know anything about power . And for those who fear what lies ahead ... I can 't control it . Let me help you , Peter . MOHINDER : The most important question of all : Can we ever really change what we are ? Hey ! Hey ! What are you do ... Hey ! You ... You can see me . You ... Nobody can see me ! I 'm invisible . What happened ? It just sort of fell . Who are you ? How can you see me ? I , uh , I don 't know . I just do what you can do . Fantastic . One of those . One of those ? What do you mean ? You know someone else like me ? Hey , wait . Where are you going ? You need to explain this . Look , I saw you . What ? I saw you in my dream . Who are you ? Hey ! I 'm no one . I 'm the invisible man . I 'm Claude Rains . Now get away from me . Forget you ever saw me . Yeah , but you know what 's happening to me . What is this ? What ... Listen , I found you . I need you to help me . Why would I want to do that ? Because we 're in danger . This entire city is in danger . Yeah , it was in my dream . People die , we die . I don 't know when , but it happens . Then you 'd better leave town . Hey ! Where are you going ? You can 't hide from me . I 'm the invisible man . I can walk around the corner and disappear forever . Yeah , but I can see you . I 'm going to follow you . Smarter men than you have tried and they 've paid for it . You stay away from me . And don 't follow me ! Red elephant with blue stripes ? Pinstripe or plaid ? Honey , I can 't see your thoughts . I can only hear ' em . Oh , I have a good one . Wait , the ratty curtains in our old apartment ? How do you do that ? I 'm not sure what 's happening . His vitals are extremely irregular . After all we 've done to him , I 'm not surprised . Keep him stabilized . There is another option . Our instructions are to keep him alive , do whatever it takes . If he crashes , you bring him back again , and again . When he dies , it 'll be on my terms , not on his . Clear ? But I 'm only two minutes over . That 'll be $ 48.50 . For one-day parking ? Hey , you want your car back , or not ? Help ! There 's a man chasing us ! Dr. Suresh . Do you remember me ? Nathan Petrelli . You yelled at my car . Yes , we met under unfortunate circumstances . I believe I came off as a deranged lunatic . Do you mind if I come in ? I 'm looking for my brother , Doctor . That makes two of us . I 'm sorry ? I 've been leaving messages for him for two days now . I guess I 'm in the wrong place , then . I need to find him . The last time I heard , he was in Texas . He made it home , barely . Barely alive , and now he 's run off again . I 'm afraid that he 's gonna somehow hurt people . Doctor , I , um , I was hoping you could explain to me what the hell is happening to him ? Before his death , my father compiled a list . Thirty-six individuals who carry a genetic marker which he discovered . A marker which he theorized gave these people certain abilities . And my brother is one of them ? As are you . I didn 't come here to talk about me . Fair enough . Peter 's specific DNA allows for a blend , like colors in a mosaic , resequencing itself to mimic the abilities of those around him . Like a chameleon . More like a sponge . It 's precisely why I 've been studying him . Could his condition become dangerous to himself , or to other people ? If he absorbs too much or comes into contact with an unstable ability , then most definitely , yes . Can you fix it ? Alter his genes somehow ? Theoretically , it is possible to develop a specific site inhibitor , but , look , I will know more when we find him . We ? Doctor , the last thing my brother needs is somebody feeding into his paranoia . But thank you . Mr. Petrelli . Of all the people on that list , your brother may be the most important . If I can find him , study him , then I can do more than help him . Then I can help all of you . Now , give me a minute , and I 'll get my coat . I told you not to follow me . I need help . You live up here ? You 're a fast learner , aren 't you , mate ? I took care of a man who owned this building . His name was Charles Deveaux . Never heard of him . You don 't think that 's strange ? I worked here , the place where you live and keep your birds . I don 't keep anything . I let them out once a day . They come back . Sounds like free will to me . I need to learn how to control this , like you do . What are you talking about ? It can 't be controlled . Well , there has to be some way . If I don 't , New York explodes . Okay ? I explode . Exploding man . Where did you get that idea ? My dreams . This place . I found you for a reason . I think you 're the one that has to teach me how to stop this . There 's no such thing . No teaching , no Sunday School for the special . What I can do , you can 't learn . You wake up in the morning , and it 's there . If you 've got thin soup , then that 's your supper . Sorry , mate . That 's the way it is . I 'm trying not to die . There 's got to be something you can do . I can kill you myself , right now , solve your exploding problem here . Maybe that 's why you dreamt me . Don 't bother looking for me . You won 't find me here again . So what exactly am I looking for here ? Anything my dad doesn 't want us to find . You said you 're good with computers . I make movies on my laptop . No , you 're good at finding those holes in that Internet password-protected nanny-blocker stuff . Shouldn 't you be watching the door ? What if your dad walks in ? He 's at work . It 's just you , me , and Mr. Muggles . There 's nothing . There 's not even any porn . Gross . I 'm serious . This thing is totally clean . No . My dad lied to me about my entire life , my biological parents , my ability , you can 't just hide things like that . There 's got to be something on there . If your dad 's the guy you 're describing , I don 't think he 's gonna keep his secrets on the family computer . Uh-oh . Shut it down . Go . Okay , okay . I thought you were at work . Forgot my cell . Zachary , what a nice surprise to see you here . Yes , biology class . We 're lab partners now . Yeah , we were just doing some research on the Internet . We have a presentation on ... The manatee , also known as the sea cow . Do you mind if I talk to Claire in private for a moment ? You can wait in my room . It 's upstairs , second door on the right . So , you and Zach ? Miss Gomez stuck us together . Must be some social experiment or something . Worst day ever . Claire . What ? You two used to be friends . You might find you actually get along . Nice save . Thanks . So , what now ? I need to talk to someone who has some answers . He said if I needed him , I should hang these outside my window . What the hell are you talking about ? Okay , wait . You 're saying that the guy with the glasses actually abducted you ? Yes . And he did this to you ? Yeah . Yeah , and I 've got to figure out how he did this , and I 'm gonna take him and everybody with him down . That Haitian guy , all of them . Matt , I 'm sorry , I 've got to say , this is all a little nuts . I mean , first the whole psychic thing , and now ... God . Come on , you 're telling me you 're about to run off and chase some guy who works in a paper factory in Texas ? They did this to me , Janice . I need to find them . I have to figure out what this is all about . Maybe you can call the FBI . No , I can 't . I can 't go to the FBI . They think I 'm crazy . I 've got to get ready . I 've got a review hearing this morning . I 'm about to get my ass handed to me by three captains . Yes , I will call the plumber today . Are you always gonna be in my head ? Well , I can 't control this thing . You can 't , or you won 't ? Oh ! Oh ! Hiro , Hiro ! Who are you ? Hey ! Hello . Let me go . I am very special . I offer myself in trade . Release unspecial Ando , and I go with you . Okay ? Good deal , yes ? What are you doing ? You no like the good deal ? Why did you take that off me ? I 'm Dr. Witherson . I 'm a psychiatrist . And I have been assigned to your case . Go . You shouldn 't be in here . It 's not safe . If it makes you feel more comfortable , we can put the restraints back on while we talk . You don 't understand . The drugs keep her weak . That jacket can 't stop her . Give me a shot . You mean Jessica ? How do you know her name ? I read your file . I know all about your past , your marriage , your website , your sister . Her accident . Her name was Jessica , too , isn 't that right ? Give me another shot . You know , I haven 't made an official diagnosis yet , but it seems like we 're dealing with a classic case of multiple personality disorder . You 're wasting your time . Just go . You know ... It 's okay , it 's okay . It makes sense , facing the kind of sentence that you 're facing , that you want to give up . You think your life is over , but it 's not . You can still make something of yourself in here . People do it all the time , but you 've got to want help . And , yeah , it can take years to integrate a multiple personality , but if you let me , I can help you . What I am , you can 't fix . Just give me another shot , and go away . No . Oh , man , I 'm trying to pay this rent . You know , it would really help if you ... No , it 's cool . It 's cool . I know you would if you could . Thanks , anyway . So , have you seen my lunch box or not ? I don 't know . It 's wherever you left it . I left it in the car . Then that 's where it is . Okay , so where 's the car ? The car 's in the shop . Micah ? So you lost my lunch box ? I didn 't lose anything . It 's in the car . Fine . You make bad lunch anyways . Micah ! Micah ! It 's not my fault you can 't keep track of your own stuff . Mom always put my lunch in my backpack every single morning . Well , I 'm not your mom . Yeah , that 's for sure . Micah , this isn 't easy . It wasn 't easy for Mom , either . But she always found a way of making some money , Dad . I 'm late for school . Do you have any idea how dangerous this is ? You said if I had an emergency to hang the chimes outside my window . Is your father becoming suspicious ? No , and it 's kind of a problem . Every word out of my mouth is a lie . I have to laugh and smile and look him in the eye . My own father . It 's breaking my heart . Would you prefer I took your memory ? I need to know that one thing in my life is real . Do you know who my real parents are ? Of your father , I know nothing . And my mother ? Only that she died in an explosion here in Texas , 14 years ago . My mother died ? Are you sure ? Your father told me many years ago . He had no reason to lie . This is the last conversation we have about this . Now you need to go back home , and forget about your real parents . The groomer missed one of Mr. Muggles ' nails . I 'm gonna run him back by the shop before they close . Don 't want you scratching up my wood floors . No , we don 't . Where 's Claire ? She 's at the library getting books for some biology report . I cannot believe how many projects they lay on these kids . I don 't know how she holds everything in that head of hers . No , I don 't . You 're still worried about her , aren 't you ? She 's had a rough couple of weeks . Well , besides a little memory loss , I 'd say she 's doing just peachy . Do you really ? It 's Lyle you need to worry about . That boy is getting so absent-minded lately . Yes , yes , we 'll be back . Yes ? I did everything I could . He 's dead . Well , that 's less than ideal . What do you want me to do with the body ? Get it ready for shipping . I 'll be in later . There was a fire in an apartment house 14 years ago in Kermit , Texas . Kermit , why does that sound so familiar ? Because of the frog ? Check it out . A 21-year-old woman was killed in the explosion , Meredith Gordon . Oh , my God . Also killed in the fire was her 18-month-old daughter . Claire , I think that 's you . But I didn 't die . Somebody thought you did . What am I supposed to do with all of this ? You may still have a real family out there . Maybe you 've got an aunt , or a rich eccentric uncle . Great , an uncle . Who knows ? One of them might even know who your real father is . Well , I 'm surprised you left out the flying saucers . Officer Parkman , is this really the statement you want entered into your public record ? That a paper salesman from Odessa , Texas , is currently harboring a super-powered serial killer , and that you raided his warehouse on a hunch ? Sir , all I 've ever wanted to do was protect and serve , to help my fellow man . I 'll ask you again . Do you want your future as a police officer to be decided by what you 've written here ? Just say yes , so I can flush it down the toilet . At this time , I 'd like to recant my previous written statement . I made the whole thing up . Why did you do that ? I failed to make detective three times , sir , and , uh , quite frankly , I was sick of directing traffic , handing out speeding tickets , and I wanted to look like a hero . I am sorry for any shame that I may have brought this department . Great , a liar , not a nutcase . Officer Parkman , pending review of your case by a civilian ombudsman and union representative , we 're enforcing a six-month suspension of your active duties . We 're gonna need your gun and your badge . Janice ? Matt , will you come upstairs ? Oh , Matt ! What ? Now are you gonna fix the pipes ? Oh , God . Give me a wrench . Where are you taking us ? Tell your boss I 'm on very important mission . I know all about your so-called mission to save the world , Mr. Nakamura . You think you have a power , and that you can use it to make a difference . Two first-class tickets , non-stop to Tokyo . First-class ? You aren 't answering your cell phone . I 've been looking everywhere for you . What 's he doing here ? Making up for past mistakes . I 'd like to help you . You leaving town ? Yeah , I think I 'd get away for a little while . What ? Be a danger to somebody else ? There 's got to be another way , Peter . Let me help you . You can 't . But maybe I can . How ? We find that answer together . If you allow me to test you with more research , I ... So you can cure me ? You 're gonna fix all of this . It will take study and then time . Time ? I don 't have time to be your guinea pig . I have a plane to catch . I 'm not letting you run away , Peter . So , what , you 're gonna call the cops on me , Nathan ? You gonna tell them your brother 's going nuclear ? I could have my mentally ill brother detained . For his own safety . I know you want to help me . You 're my big brother , you fix everything , but you can 't ... You can 't fix this one this time . I can . Look , let 's just sit down . We can figure this out . Okay . Okay ? Okay . Peter ! Where did he go ? Who ? You 're supposed to watch the door . My God , did he just ... Get down to the airport , and make sure he doesn 't get away this time . Yes , sir . Yeah , just help yourself . Your place ? Yeah . Guy with family connections like yours could do a lot better . Left the family business . I 'm a nurse now . Nurse who 's an empath , very cute . Empath , what 's that mean ? It means you 're a pain in my ass , mate . Yeah , but you 're following me . Yeah , well , I 'm not very much of a people person , but I 'm certainly not gonna let you kill them all . You seemed pretty sure about that pending apocalypse of yours . Yeah , not unless you help me control it . You don 't know what you 're asking , what you have to go through . You might want to reconsider dying . Hell of a lot easier . I can handle it . Yeah , that 's what they all say . They ? How many people have you taught before me ? Come on , mate , I 'll steal us a cab . You coming or not ? So they suspended me for six months . Oh , Matt . I actually thought this ability was gonna be a good thing , and now I 'm unemployed and about to lose my marriage . You haven 't lost that . Not yet , anyway . Thanks , that 's encouraging . Look , we ... We just have to trust each other . I can do that . Yeah . So I 'm gonna give you one more freebie . What am I thinking ? We 're having a baby ? We 're having a baby ! Nik , what have they done to you ? If they catch you ... They won 't . Come closer . What is it ? Your shirt . It smells like home . How 's Micah ? Is he okay ? He 's fine . It 's just ... I can 't do this , Nik . Not alone . I thought I could . I thought I could handle everything , but ... D.L. , you can 't do this to me . I have got to find a way to get you out of here . This is crazy . I can walk in here any time I want , right ? I should be able to get you out . I am going to be in here for a long time . The rest of my life , maybe . You need to get used to that . Your son needs you . Damn it , D.L. , that is not fair . I am counting on you . And you know that I need to stay in here . I need you , Nik . We need you . He 's having such a hard time without you . You need to talk to him . You need to be honest . He needs boundaries , and a strong hand . It 's not too late . You need to go . Go . There 's only 12 people in Kermit with the last name Gordon . So far , only three . None of them have ever heard of Meredith . Claire ? I 'll call you back . Claire . Sorry , I was just talking to Zach about our report . Ah , well . Molly in accounting is married to a marine biologist , and he said that ... You 're already on top of it . Did you know that all three varieties of the manatee are vulnerable to extinction ? No , I didn 't . Is everything all right ? We haven 't talked in a while . Actually , there is something . Yeah ? The bears , my stuffed bears . I think it 's time for them to migrate . I 'm almost 16 , Dad . Bears and talks can 't last forever . Whether you 're 16 , or 32 , or 64 ... When I 'm 64 , you 'll be ... ... I will be there for you . Always . Don 't you think it 's time I learn how to deal with my own problems ? Well , dinner 's in an hour , and just do me a favor . No extinction talk at the table . You know how sensitive your mother is . You had a change of heart ? My son . My family needs me , so ... I want you to understand that there are no guarantees . I don 't care . I need to get rid of Jessica . So , you know what might help ? If I could talk to her . All right ? Isn 't there another way ? No . I 'm afraid in cases like these , it is imperative that I have interaction with all aspects of the patient 's personality . Honey , let me talk to her . No . You can 't . So , let me put it to you this way . Either I speak with Jessica , or you may not see your little boy for a very , very long time . Bye . Wait . Micah , where have you been ? I was worried to death . I was just out walking around . Sit down . Micah , we 've got to figure this out , because the truth is your mom 's not coming home . I 'm having a really hard time , here . I can 't get a job . I can barely pay the rent . I never felt much like a man in my life . My father never taught me , but I want to be a good dad to you . But I 'm gonna need your help . We 've got to pull together , and make this work , because it 's just you and me . I 'm sorry , Dad . I can try harder . Maybe this will help . Where 'd you get ... Where 'd you get this from ? You know how you and mom have a secret ? Well , I have a secret , too . That 's up to the Boss . Hello ? Hi , I 'm looking for someone related to Meredith Gordon . She died in an explosion 14 years ago . I 've been calling everyone in Kermit with the last name of Gordon . Any chance that you 're related to her ? Who is this ? My name 's Claire Bennet . I 'm calling from Odessa . What is this about ? And how do you know the name Meredith Gordon ? I think she was my mom . Is this some kind of joke ? No , ma 'am . Well , Meredith only had one daughter , and she died in the fire . Well , that 's kind of what I 'm trying to say , is I didn 't die . I think I 'm her , and I 'm looking for any information I can find about my mom . Well , then you made the right call . This is her . Mom ? Yeah . How 's Claire ? Darn . My power is lost until I get the sword . It focused the smaurai Kensei 's power . It will do the same for me . But Hiro , if you have no power , How can we steal the sword ? I will find a way That sword is my destiny . A samurai 's weapon must be used with honor . And respect . This sword has many lessons to teach . Swords are for killing . That 's why they 're sharp . Maybe I use the sword to kill bomb-man . Is it my destiny to kill this man ? Hiro , wait ! What is it ? That man , waiting by our car ... He doesen 't look very friendly . He has a gun . Do something ! I have no power ! The painting is valuable . Maybe they 're trying to steal it . But if we don 't deliver it to Linderman ... we will never ger the sword . How long do we stay under here ? Until they are gone . Who are these people ? And why is everyone always chasing us ? Because I 'm special . Well I 'm not special . And I 'm tired of fetting chased . I 'm going to have oil all over my back ... because of you ! You can surrender . But I will never surrender . A hero never gives up . Did you feel something ? This way ! You came back for me . This is how we roll . Why isn 't he talking to us ? Maybe ... he is not the Big Boss . You are ... [ b ] WRONG [ / b ] . Who are you ? I work for someone ... who has true power . A man who knows what you 're up to . And wants you ... to stop . Ando , do not be tempted . Those tickets are a test ... of our devotion to our mission . You cannot bribe a hero . My heart is true . My spirit unbreakable . When I meet your Big Boss , I will tell him the same thing ! Oh - - he won 't like that . Not one bit . Where are we ? Your secret headquarters ? You let us go now ? Hiro , please . I don 't want to meet the Boss . I want to go home . Tell them what they want to hear . Do not be afraid , my friend . I shall never betray you . No matter what . Father ?

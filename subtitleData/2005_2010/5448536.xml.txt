 My brother Joseph and I have had two families . The first one , well , let 's just say it didn 't work out too well . But over the years , we made ourselves a new one . And it was to this family , all of you , that his heart really belonged . You see , a family is something that Joseph and I needed . It offered us protection from the outside world , a world that never understood or appreciated what makes us different . There are others like us out there , in the shadows , in the light , each grasping for meaning in a world that won 't accept them for who they really are . They , like us , are blessed , gifted with extraordinary abilities . And they , like us , struggle with finding their place in an ordinary world , haunted by their past from those who would harm them and keep them from their destiny . Every one of them deserves a chance to be who they really are . But to what end ? For what purpose ? Here in this place , we offer salvation . We offer hope . We offer redemption . And one by one , they will come to our side , to our family , and they will find their way home . And all who have gathered will be strong . And all who have gathered will stand in unison . I say it 's time we found our way back home again . Find your way home , Brother . You must be my new roommate . Yeah , I guess I am . I 'm Claire . Hi , I 'm Annie . It 's nice to finally meet you , Claire . You , too . The school , they wouldn 't release any information . Otherwise I would have friended you on Facebook . That 's my fault . I always check those little privacy boxes for some reason . I did that same thing with my AP Classmates profile after I got a B + in AP physics . Are you on APClassmates . Com ? No , I 'm not in advanced placement . I got my GED . It 's not because I dropped out or anything . I was just traveling . You got into this school with a GED ? What do your parents do ? Uh ... My mom breeds championship show dogs and my dad works for the government . So that 's how you got in with a GED . No . I just got really good scores . Oh . Well , you 'll probably place in Fenten 's linear algebra class , then , today . Today ? He only takes 35 students a semester , and the placement test is today at 1 : 00 . You get in and it pretty much sets the whole dominoes into motion , you know ? So , what 's your plan for graduate school ? I don 't really have one . Guess that 's kind of why I 'm here . No , you have to go to college with the plan . How are you gonna find your future without a map ? You have a map of your future ? Yeah . See , I call this my trajectory . This is me in three years , graduating magna cum laude in poli-sci pre-law . This is me in eight years , Massachusetts Attorney General . And this is me in 12 years , being sworn in as the youngest governor in US history . Wow , you really thought that through . Don 't you think it 's time you put childish things behind you and thought this through yourself , Claire ? I mean , don 't let GED be a lifestyle choice . I 'll tell you what . If you want , I 'll help you make your own trajectory . It can be our project . Sounds great . Dispatch , this is Unit 5-9 . We are 12 blocks out . We 're on it . On it ? We 're on it . Look at this parking lot . We 're not going anywhere in this mess . You 're right . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna hoof it . You 're crazy . We 're 12 blocks away . You 'll never make it on foot . Hesam , I grew up out here . There 's always a shortcut . Hi . I 'm here to save you . Roomie ! Hey , Claire ! Hey ! Hi ! Sorry . I 'm so excited . You know , if you pass this test , then we 're gonna be in class together . You and I are gonna keep each other on our tippy toes . But please don 't think of this as a competition , okay ? This is about sisterhood . Yay . Sisterhood ! Okay ! This is a placement test for Linear Algebra 170 . Thirty-five of you geniuses will be lucky enough to get in this class . The rest , you can try next semester . You each have 45 minutes to solve this equation . Please show your work . Is this a joke ? I know . It 's so easy . Are you sweating ? No . No , it 's just a little hot in here . Where are you going ? This class isn 't for me . There he is ! So , that pregnant woman ? Uh-huh . Heard she delivered twins . Named them both Peter . That pregnant woman 's name is Kristie , and she had twin girls . Thank you . Named them Haley and Katie . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hey , they 're still up in Neonatal . You know , you should stop by . They 'd like to thank you in person . I 'm good . What ? You single-handedly saved three lives . If it was me , I 'd be floating on cloud nine right now . I am . You could have fooled me . What 's going on with you ? If I had showed up 30 seconds later , that woman , her babies , they 'd be dead . It 's too close , man . I gotta be faster . Dude , you got there faster than humanly possible . If I was a religious man , I 'd think it was a miracle . A miracle . Catch you tomorrow . Well , hang on . Where you going ? Took another shift . We just got off a double ! Yeah , I know , but James is sick , I figured I 'd cover for him . Too late . Jackson 's already covering . Dude , there 's a life outside this place . Now , me and some of the guys are going out . Houlihan 's is still open . Come with us . I 'm good , man . I 'll see you tomorrow . Have fun . I 'll see you tomorrow . I take it you 've seen the paper this morning . All four worked in Building 26 . Danko 's men . These are revenge killings , and we both know it 's Tracy Strauss . I 'm sure it won 't be long before she makes her way up that list to me . Or Nathan . Which is exactly why you 're gonna stop dragging your feet and pull the trigger on this operation . It 's been six weeks , Noah . I 've given you time to put your personal life in order . And Nathan says you 're avoiding his phone calls . By Nathan , you mean Sylar , right ? We 've been over this , Noah . It 's all working exactly as planned . As planned ? What plan ? We had no other choice . Matt Parkman had to turn Sylar into Nathan , and as I recall , you were in on it . I made an emotional decision because I didn 't want to see you lose your son , but it was wrong . For 50 years , the Company avoided emotions , for good reason . I can barely look him in the eye knowing who 's under that skin . Then don 't . Just do your job and get the Company up and running . You 're supposed to be the man with the plan , remember ? I 'm not sure I 'm that guy anymore . Why is that ? Because I 've lost my family , Angela . If you 'll excuse me , today is Claire 's first day of college , and I 'm already late , which doesn 't help the situation . Danko . It appears Tracy Strauss has paid you a visit . What I can 't figure out is how she survived . I put a bullet in her myself . She shattered into a thousand pieces of ice . Ice melts . I 'm gonna take a wild guess that your being here isn 't a coincidence . I 'm here to offer a solution to our mutual problem . You and I kill Tracy Strauss before she kills us . Last time I made a deal with you , you tried to stab me with a syringe . Fair enough . I 'm thinking you 're next on her list . That makes us both wanted men . So what are you doing here ? You ought to be hiding under a rock somewhere . Just because the government 's stopped hunting these people doesn 't mean I have . I hear you and the Petrellis are going back into business to do just that . You heard wrong . I 'm not in that business anymore . I 'm changing careers . What 'd you do , grow a conscience ? Time to cash out , start over . Guys like us , we don 't start over . I 'm not like you . She 's coming back for you . You know that , right ? Then I guess you 're on your own . I guess I am . No , thank you . You made the right call . Cheerleaders are a very subversive group . You don 't want to mix with that crowd . No , thanks . I used to be one of them . Oh . So you know . I do . Were you ? You weren 't a cheerleader , were you ? Uh ... No . I tried out , but I didn 't make the team . They said that my cheers sounded more like taunts . Yeah , that 's not good . I 'm Gretchen Berg . Who are you ? I 'm Claire Bennet . Oh , hi , Claire Bennet . So , where are you from ? Kind of all over the place . I 've been in Southern California for a while , but Texas , originally , Odessa . Really ? I 'm from Austin . Small world . Wait , you 're not that Claire Bennet , are you ? Which Claire Bennet would that be ? Murder-at-Union-Wells - in-Odessa Claire Bennet . You heard about that ? A cheerleader in Texas gets her head sawed off at the homecoming game ? Yeah , I 've heard about that . You know , I kind of want to keep the whole murder at Union Wells on the DL . No kidding . I mean , if I were you , I would change my name . Like now . They 'd probably let you do it over the phone . No , they won 't . I would know . I changed my name for a while . Oh . Why 'd you change it back ? 'Cause I wanted to be Claire Bennet again . I thought people might forget . No , girl , Google 's your enemy . I have to take care of something . Nice to meet you . You , too . What have you done to me , Mom ? It took me a half hour to get here . I 'm sorry . Where are my manners ? You look lovely , as usual . Ms. Petrelli , we 're here . Thank you , Alfred . What have you done to me ? It took me a half an hour to get here . I 'm sorry . Where are my manners ? You look lovely . As usual . You okay , Mom ? Yeah . I 'm just ... I 'm worried about the Company , that 's all . I 'm worried that Noah might be wavering . He 's been very distracted lately . I 'll talk to him . Don 't worry . Do I like sushi ? You 're the one who had a craving for yellowtail . I wanted Italian . It 's interesting . Life , it 's all about new horizons . Keeps you from getting stale . Exactly . You know , these last couple of weeks , I 've been taking stock of a lot of things . I feel like there 's a lot of ... I don 't know , Mom , there 's just a lot of change going on with me . Really ? Yeah . How so ? I don 't know . It 's like , when I look back on my life , it just seems like it 's not my life I 'm looking back on . I don 't know . That make any sense ? Self-reflection . Happens when you hit 40 , along with all sorts of other unpleasant surprises . I 'm being serious , Mom . Look at the kind of person I 've been , the kind of father , the kind of brother , the kind of son to you . You 've been just fine , under the circumstances . No . I have been a jackass . But I 'm gonna change all that . I 'm gonna reconnect with everybody in my life who 's important , and this time , I 'm gonna be a better me . Okay , Nathan , you have a big , important , stressful life and it 's bound to get confusing . And a man your age starts to feel his own mortality . That 's just it . I don 't feel mortal . I feel invincible . It 's a midlife crisis . That 's all this is . Here 's my suggestion . You go out and you get yourself a big , expensive sports car and a younger woman with questionable morals . That 's what your father did , and it worked for him . What would I be without you ? I 'm going to get the phone , okay ? - Yeah ? - Detective Parkman ? Angela Petrelli . I told you never to call me . We have a problem . What kind of problem ? That thing you did six weeks ago ... You mean , when you and Bennet strong-armed me into playing God ? That thing ? I think Sylar 's beginning to emerge again . That 's because he is Sylar . No , you made Sylar go away when you turned him into my son . I saw you do it . Okay , then why the hell are you calling me ? Because you need to fix it . You need to patch it up . Upgrade it . Whatever it is you do . How , exactly ? Go back into his mind and erase his memory again . That 's what you do . No , not anymore . I stopped . Look , ever since that day , I have felt like something got inside of me and I can 't get it out . I 've started seeing things , and I 've stopped , okay ? I 'm done . I 'm out . There 's no such thing as out , Detective , not for people like us . Yeah , speak for yourself . I 'm telling you Sylar could emerge at any minute . Are you telling me you are not willing to fix our problem ? This is not our problem . This is your problem . So , good luck with it . And , honestly , I 'm sure she could be a really above-average student if she just applied herself . Claire . Hey , you made it . Yeah , I 'm sorry I 'm late . I was having a little trouble with my car . And Annie was just catching me up . She was ? So , I 'll see you at the mixer tonight . I hear they have Guitar Hero III set up down there , and , well , I sort of excel at Guitar Hero III , so consider yourself served . It was very nice to meet you , Mr. Bennet . You , too . So , Annie was catching you up ? Maybe you can take that algebra class next semester . See , Daddy , that is probably the least interesting part of my day . How so ? I was recognized as a survivor of the homecoming massacre back in Odessa . Well , my name was . I 'm sorry . You know , maybe changing your name back to Bennet wasn 't such a great idea after all , but they say college is for reinventing yourself . I don 't want to pretend to be anyone but me . I just want to be Claire Bennet , daughter of Noah Bennet . You know , Annie asked me today what my dad did for a living , and I actually told her the truth-ish . I told her you work for the government , but still . And I like telling the truth . What if my way of reinventing myself is by telling the truth ? Ish . Ish . Maybe not the whole truth . No . The whole truth ? Just be careful , sweetheart . All right , Lydia . Show me who he is . His name is Danko . Emile Danko . You wanted to see me , Samuel ? I have a favor to ask of you , Edgar . Can 't you send someone else this time ? I 'd take it as a compliment to your unique skills . Well , what you said this morning about redemption , I 'm hoping that 's possible for all of us . Yes , well , I left out the part about vengeance . That 's where he comes in . We 've only killed when we absolutely had to . A line has been crossed . They crossed it , not us . I need you to go to him , get the compass back and kill the son of a bitch . It 's what Joseph would have wanted . Well , Joseph 's not here anymore . I 'm sorry , Edgar . I won 't ask you again after this one . I promise . And here I was , thinking that I 'd be the one that got away . No , you 're just number five . Well , five 's my lucky number . Or it used to be . Is it still lucky ? I haven 't decided yet . I saw you break into a thousand pieces , and yet here you are . That is a neat trick . It wasn 't a trick . I felt myself shatter , melting . And then all those pieces of me came floating back together with one cohesive thought , killing all of you . Okay , now , see , that 's the part that I don 't get , because I don 't think that you 're really a killer . That 's not who you are . No , no , that 's all I am . You took the rest away from me . I can help you get your life back . How ? Danko said that he wouldn 't stop until I was killed . What if I could make it so that Danko wasn 't interested in you anymore ? Why do you want to do this for me ? Twenty years of bagging and tagging and I never helped a single one of you . Maybe we 're both looking for redemption . What do you say ? Is it a deal ? Mmm . I bet you wish it was that easy . I got your phone call . Change your mind about Tracy Strauss ? No , I came here to change yours . Sorry . I 'm gonna kill her , even if I have to suck her up in a wet vac to do it . She murdered four of my men . She 's a killer . I 'm recommending that you let this thing go . You said guys like us never start over . I 'm offering you a chance to do just that . Consider it a permanent vacation courtesy of the US government . Not interested . Not acceptable . I want you to forget about Tracy Strauss . Well , we all want things , Bennet . And I 'm going to get what I want . Hey , this is Peter . Leave a message . I 'll get back to you when I can . Thanks . Look , I 've left you ... I 've left you three messages . You need to call me back . Something 's happening to me , and I think you 're the only person who 's going to understand what it is . It 's ... Just call me . Please . Who the hell are you ? You know exactly who I am . They sent you to get it back . He made you forget . What did you say ? It 's not worth it . Who are you ? You took something from us . Now I 'm gonna get it back . You 're never gonna find it . Oh . I think I will . Hey . Hi . I 'm sorry if I freaked you out with that whole " Murder at Union Wells " thing . I just ... It was so scandalous , and I got excited . No , no , no , don 't apologize . It was just weird talking about it because I was never allowed to talk about it before . So , what , you pretended like it didn 't happen ? No , I just kept trying to start my life over , and I thought I could take what I liked about who I was and leave all the other stuff behind . Whoo ! Yeah ! That is how you play Guitar Hero . Claire , hey , come on . Over here ! You and me ! You have been served ! Come on ! Who is she ? She 's horrible . She 's been hogging that thing all night . That would be my roommate . Come on , we 're up ! I was gonna play with Gretchen . Does Gretchen know how to play ? No , but Gretchen doesn 't care . Your opponent 's supposed to raise your game , not lower it . Well , since neither one of us know what we 're doing , we 'll be on even playing fields . This is gonna be really bad . Ooh ! I got one . Yellow ! - Yes ! Yes ! - Oh , no ! I must be getting better every second . Hiro , Hiro , Hiro ! Hiro ? Hiro ? Hiro ? Hiro ? Hiro ! Who is he ? His name is Hiro . Hiro Nakamura . And he was here , at the carnival . When ? How long ago ? Fourteen years . Thank you , Lydia . That 's all for now . Are we really going to stop moving after all these years ? It 's time . Yes . Listen , I know you 're weak . But I need you to try and do it one more time , for me . I think we 've found someone who can help us fix the past . That 's good news , Samuel . Yes . So ... I need you to send me back . How far ? Fourteen years . Hey , I didn 't see you leave the party . Guess you 're still there . And you left the windows open . Matty ? Matty ! Matty . Matty , are you hiding again ? Where 's Matty ? Hi , Daddy . I want my body back . You put him down . Please . Oh , poor Daddy . He looks pretty scared , huh ? Can you say " freaking out " ? I don 't ... I don 't understand . How are you even here ? I 'm part of you , Matt . Whatever you did to me , I held on . Now I 'm inside your head . So , you 're not real . Then how could I be holding your little boy ? Just put him down . Not until you give me what I want . You did something to me , to my mind . That 's why I 'm here . Tell me what you did . Where did you put my body ? Okay . Just put him down and then we 'll talk about this . Tell me . Matt ? Here comes Mommy . Catch . No ... Matt , are you okay ? Yeah . Thought I heard him crying , that 's all . Matty 's fast asleep . What 's going on with you ? I 'm just tired , I guess . Come back to bed . Hello ? I must 've dialed the wrong number . Who are you looking for ? Sandra Bennet . Yeah , she 's here . Hang on . Sandra . Hello ? Hello ? Sandra ? No . No , this is Tracy . I didn 't do it . What have you got to lose , Hiro ? Do I know you ? The name 's Samuel , and I think we 're gonna be great friends . Did your roommate express any suicidal thoughts , feelings of being overwhelmed ? Low self-esteem ? No . No . If anything , she had too much self-esteem . She was an overachiever . She loved herself . That 's not the impression she left in her suicide note . What suicide note ? This was on her pillow . No , it wasn 't . May have been something you overlooked . No . I distinctly remember being impressed with how crisp her pillowcase was and that there wasn 't a suicide note . This wasn 't there . Would you get them out of here ? You said she was an overachiever ? Look , even an overachiever can 't write a suicide note after she 's dead . She wouldn 't do this . She was just beating the entire floor 's butt at Guitar Hero . This was not a suicide . What then ? Murder ? Why would someone want to murder your roommate ? I don 't know . Isn 't that your job ? Yep . It sure is . Thanks for your help , Miss Bennet . So , you 're a time traveler . Yes ! How did you know that ? I have a gift , Hiro . Just like you . Whoa . What are you doing here ? I 'm thinking it has something to do with that young man . Is he you ? Yes . But I cannot interfere . Why not ? Because this is where it starts , how I become the master of time and space . If I interfere , I will never become a hero . I won 't save the cheerleader , and New York will explode ! It 's the butterfly effect ! Hmm . That would be bad . But I bet there are some butterflies that you could change . I mean , why not make this trip worthwhile ? No . You can never change the past . It 's bad . Always . Everything is connected ! Not everything . Sometimes , if you wanna change one thing , that 's all you do . Change one thing . You have a rare gift , Hiro , to right the wrongs of your life . Isn 't there anything else you 'd care to fix ? The slushy incident ! That was all my fault . I bumped into Ando and made him spill his drink all over Kimiko 's favorite dress ! That is the reason why she started to hate him . Now 's your chance to make them happy . You have the power . No . I have a code . To never change the ... There are things in this world that are wrong , Hiro . You can make them right . If you master these skills , you and I will have a bright future together . You and me ? I don 't understand . You just need to take a chance . Oh ! Danko and I , we were just talking in the hall . The next thing I know , he 's dead and this guy is on me . I got lucky . This whole water thing , it just ... It kicked in on instinct . What are you doing here , Tracy ? I wanted you to leave Danko to me . I couldn 't just let it go . I didn 't know if I could trust you to deal with him . This is my life . I needed to know . When I got here , I saw that you did what you promised . He didn 't know me . So , I figured , just live and let live . And as I was leaving , this guy ... The guy with the knives ? He was fast . Scary fast . Definitely one of us . One of me . You have no idea why he 'd want to kill Danko ? I think I heard him say he was looking for something . I don 't know . Maybe it was revenge . Danko made a lot of enemies . This wasn 't revenge . Look at the wounds . They 're all to the stomach . If it were me and I was looking for revenge , I 'd go for the jugular or the carotid artery or the heart . No . I think you heard right . I think the killer was looking for something . That 's personal . And I think I found it . What is that ? A key . To what ? That 's a good question . Come on , Matty-man . You can do it . Show me you 're a big boy . Look at you ! All right ! Did you see that ? Good job . I got him . I got him . Good job , dude . God , he usually takes so much longer to warm up to strangers . Roy 's not a stranger . He 's been delivering water to us since Matty was born . I can 't believe it 's been that long . Time flies , huh , Janice ? Yeah . Yeah , it sure does . Whoa . Listen , the heating unit on your cooler is busted . I 'll swing by later and fix it . Thanks , Roy . Yeah , thanks , Roy . No problem . Bye . Bye . What ? " Janice " ? That 's my name . No . Your name is Mrs. Parkman . Look , when I delivered water , we were professional . You never delivered water . Pizza , water . Whatever . That 's not the point . The point is ... He was here , I wasn 't and I 'm just a little pissed . I thought we were past that . Yeah . Yeah , we are . I 'm sorry . Hey . You 're tired . You haven 't been sleeping properly . Well , I 've been snoring a lot less . So ... I 'm worried about you . It 's just work . I ... I got a lead on this huge drug ring , and it ... All I need is the name of the supplier . And if you could read a few minds , it would be a lot easier , and you 'd get some answers , right ? Yeah . But I told you I 'm not doing that anymore , right ? I kicked that for good . I know . And I 'm proud of you . I 'm just worried that it 's taking a toll . Don 't worry . I got this under control . Hello , Peter . Can we talk for a minute ? Can I get you something to drink ? Yeah , thanks . Love what you 've done with the place . Thank you . So , I have water or mustard . Water 's good . So what 've you been up to ? Got my old job back . Paramedic . Must be keeping you busy . Your mother says she hasn 't seen you in weeks . Wow . This is amazing . Is this all you ? Mmm-hmm . You using powers ? In my line of work , it helps to be strong , agile . Thank you , Dr. Suresh . It 's a pretty convenient power . Good for you . I figure one of us has got to make up for all we 've done . Meaning ? You , me , my family , the Company . Come on , we haven 't exactly been model citizens , Noah . That 's a pretty heavy burden for one guy . You said you wanted to talk ? Yeah . Danko 's dead . Killed because of this . A key . I did some research . This key opens a safe deposit box in a downtown bank . Now , the way I figure it , the guy that killed Danko is probably just waiting for whoever shows up with this key . I need a partner on this , somebody I can trust . He could jump me just about anywhere , and I 'd never know what hit me 'cause he 's super fast and he has a thing for knives . How fast ? Thanks for letting me stay with you . Of course . I would never leave you here , not after what happened . Annie 's parents came by last night . I thought they should know about the supposed suicide letter . You didn 't say anything , did you ? No . But I think they have the right to know . Don 't you ? I mean , if it were me , you would want to know . It 's not your business to tell the parents about the note . Let the police handle it . It 's the truth . Welcome back . Hey . Gretchen , this is my mom . Mom , Gretchen . Hi . Hi . Pleasure . Bizarre , huh ? I heard you told the cops that you didn 't see a suicide note . So , what do you think ? Murder or horrific accident ? Claire may have been mistaken about the note . May have been ? Did you see one or not ? Well , I didn 't at first . But it was dark . Maybe I missed it . Suicide makes no sense . I mean , the girl had a trajectory . Who maps out their life for the next 50 years and then throws themselves out a window ? I should go . You okay ? Yeah . Thanks for everything . You 're welcome . Remember , new life , new beginning . Bye . Nice to meet you . Likewise . So , it 's murder , right ? How do we prove it ? So you think your knife guy is gonna show ? I don 't know , but it sure makes me feel better having you around . Yeah , I 'll bet . Do you mind if I make an observation ? I think you should seriously consider how you 're living your life . Where did that come from ? I saw your apartment , the police scanner , all those newspaper articles . You 're saving lives and you 're keeping track . I 'll bet you know every one of their names . And ? Do any of them know yours ? It 's not healthy to live alone , Peter . No connections to anybody , it 's a dead end . Trust me . I 'm Exhibit " A. " For years , I put my job ahead of my family , and now my kids are off at school and I 'm eating cereal for dinner and a strange man is answering my wife 's phone . My point is , I 'm alone . That 's no way to live . Here you are , Mr. Danko . And I 'll be right outside when you 're finished . So , what 'd we win ? A compass ? Danko got killed for a compass ? A broken compass . Yeah , we need just another minute . That doesn 't belong to you . You got his power ? I got it . I got it . Bloody hell . What happened ? I don 't know . He took off . He 's still breathing . Thanks a lot , Doc . How 's he doing ? He 's recovering . I hope it was worth it . No , not really . Can 't figure out why Danko thought this was worth dying for . Can I see it ? Whoa ! Hello . What did you do ? I didn 't do anything . Well , apparently it only works for you . Here . No . No , no , no . Peter , this is a lead . You saw that guy . There could be others out there like him . Look , my life finally makes sense to me . In the last six weeks , I 've saved 53 people . I 'm with you for , what , an hour , and some innocent guy almost gets killed ? The further I stay away from you and whatever it is that you 're doing , the happier I 'm gonna be . He murdered Danko . He almost killed you and me for this . So , why don 't you just let him have it ? Look . My life is simple , okay ? I understand it . I don 't need for things to get complicated . So , why did you come with me ? The ability . It 'll help me do my job better , the one where I actually save people . I guess this is goodbye . I wish you all the luck in the world , Peter . Thank you , Noah . Hey ! Call your mother . Forensic Pathology : Principles and Practice , Spitz and Fisher 's Medicolegal Investigation of Death , Knight 's Forensic Pathology with all relevant addenda . Where did you get those ? The homicide bookstore ? Is there such a place ? Don 't you think you 're going a little overboard ? Don 't you want to prove your roommate was defenestrated ? Of course . And , yes , I know what " defenestrated " means . Well , don 't get mad at me for using it in a sentence . Have you ever heard of the " Jump , Push , Fall " test ? The what ? It 's when cops get a dummy the approximate size and weight of the victim and they throw it out of the window to see how it lands . What page is that on ? Oh . It 's not in there . I saw it on an episode of Crossing Jordan . Look , if you fall , you go straight down . If you jump , go a little further . But if you 're pushed ... Sorry . Cranky . All we need is a dummy the approximate size and weight of Annie . You 're not serious . Maybe we could swipe a cadaver from the medical school . What ? It 's a victimless crime . Let 's not get carried away . Why not ? This is murder ! Maybe . But I 'm not trying to be a social pariah before midterms . Ship 's already sailed , Claire . So , where do we get our hands on a dead body ? Hi . My name 's Matt . Hi , Matt . It 's been six weeks since I last used , and I 'm feeling confused . When I used , I was totally selfish . I didn 't think about what I did to others and how I may have hurt them . Sorry . You mean like what you did to me ? Hi . My name is Sylar . It 's been about six weeks or so since I 've seen my body , and I want it back . Recently , there have been these ghosts , these things have been popping up from my old life and haunting me . Do you really think you 're gonna stop using your powers ? Are you crazy ? I mean , I bet you couldn 't even make it through a day . I can 't seem to get these images out of my head . You 're weak . You 're simple-minded . I bet I can make you use your powers . Go away ! I could make you use your powers . I 'm sorry . Hey , buddy , you okay ? Does this guy look okay ? Seriously ? I mean , he 's , like , 20 pounds overweight , blood pressure 's through the roof . He 's like a heart attack waiting to happen ! Stop it . Stop it ! Um ... Let 's get things moving along a bit . Who 's next ? Let me take a crack at this guy , see if I can get him to talk . You seemed a little off today at the meeting . No , no , no , no . I 'm good . You sure ? I 'm good . I 'm under control . It 's good . Double shot of mocha . You look like you could use a little pick-me-up . It 's okay . No strings attached . Not interested . Come on . Let 's do this easy , right ? Just two guys talking . Come on . I get it . You are the good cop . How ironic . So , we need a name , your supplier . All right ? You give us that name , you keep a clean record . He 's a liar , totally lying . Why are you looking at my forehead ? Does it say " schmuck " or something ? I wasn 't staring at your forehead . You 're not getting a name , coffee boy . Is that all you need , Matt ? A name ? Seriously ? What the hell are you waiting for ? It 's gotta be floating around in his comical little brain somewhere , right ? I don 't do that anymore . You don 't do what anymore ? Why is that ? Because you 're addicted ? Leave me alone . Who are you talking to ? Just read his mind , Matt . You know you want to . I could help you . I could take a nice little chunk out of his skull in the process . Stop it . What 's the matter with you ? Just give me a name , okay ? Take it from him . No ! " No " what ? Why the hell not ? Leave me alone . You are a loser . Total loser . No wonder your wife is having sex with the water guy . Shut the hell up ! I didn 't say anything . I 'm not talking to you right now . Come on , Matt . She 's cheated on you once already , and we both know what Janice needs is a real man . Someone who 's not afraid of power , someone who knows what to do with it . I 'm in control here , not the power . And not you , you son of a bitch ! Keppler ! The guy 's name is Keppler . Lives in Long Beach . Okay ? Just leave me alone . Hey . Hey , man . Have a nice day off ? It was good . Very productive . I got a lot done . You okay ? Oh . Yeah . I 'm fine . Is that clam chowder ? It is . Smells good . Where 'd you get it ? A place called Legal Sea Food . Got one for you . Never heard of it . It 's up in Boston . Boston ? Yeah . How 'd you get it down here ? I know a guy . That 's the partner I know and love . - All available units . - Code 3 , 5th and Lexington . Never mind that . We still got five minutes till we 're on duty . Peter ? Noah . Noah ? Just hang on . Just hang on , okay ? What ? What ? What ? What ? They took the compass . Hi . Hey . How are you ? You know , looks worse than it feels . You called . I figured I owed it to you . Hey , you know that key inside of Danko ? Turns out it led me to a broken old compass . Your friend with the knives just came and took it back , anyway . You gonna go after him ? I don 't know . I prefer the old way of doing business . One of me , one of you . This new way just feels too dangerous to try to stop them alone . Maybe this guy with the knives is like me , just trying to get their life back , keeping what 's his . Maybe the idea isn 't to stop them but to figure out a way to help them . Yeah , maybe . So , be honest . Why did you call ? You know , I can 't call my wife , my ... Ex-wife . I didn 't want to worry Claire . So , I just ... I 'm not sure ... I get it . You don 't want to be alone . Yeah , I guess not . So , what 's in the bag ? I have no idea . What is it ? Is that clam chowder ? It 's still warm . Looks like you have someone looking out for you . You want some ? There 's plenty . You got an extra spoon ? Hey , dude . Hey . You don 't need to jam it or else you 'll just bust the coil again . Guess you don 't know your own strength . Hi , honey . Hey . Roy fixed the hot water . Awesome , Roy . Hey . Hey . Everything okay at work ? Yeah , yeah . It 's another banner day . Hey , Roy . Yeah . Let me walk you out , buddy . Oh . Sure thing . See you Tuesday , Janice . Thanks , Roy . Bye , Matty-man . You be a good boy . Hey , man . Yeah . You got a family of your own , Roy ? No . No . Maybe some day . Yeah . Look , thanks for fixing the hot water and all , but ... My pleasure . Must be tough out there for a single mom , right ? Yeah , yeah . Look , she 's not single anymore . Tomorrow you 're gonna ask for a new route and you 're never gonna stop by this house again . So , I 'm starting a new route . Guess this is goodbye . Yeah , it is . Bye , Roy . Gotcha . Jump , push , fall . I guess she did kill herself . You had me worried . Sorry . Getting the compass back was a lot harder than I thought . I met an empath . You talk to him ? Didn 't really get a chance . Lydia says you found another time traveler , someone to replace Arnold . I don 't like that word . You can 't replace family . But the Chinese guy ... Japanese . I put him on a righteous path . But he 'll come back to us . So , what 's next ? We gather the rest .

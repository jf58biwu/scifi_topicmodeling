 Previously on The 4400 ... We 're not sure what 's just happened . The light is gone and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared ! We 're letting them go . We 're letting them go ? We don 't have a legal right to hold them . You 're pregnant ? I wasn 't pregnant when I was abducted , but I was when I got back . - What 's all this ? - What 's it look like ? That baby could be the key to the future and it has to be protected and I can do that . Go ahead , run ! That baby belongs with me . - This is your new house ? - It 's yours , too . I 've been looking forward to this moment for too long . Diana Skouris , your adoption of Maia Rutledge is hereby complete , legal , and binding . Her visions stopped about four months ago . We 're not sure why . Miss Oster next door is getting a kitten . Mommy 's bosses will be punished for betraying us . It wasn 't me ! That creature made me pull the trigger ! Getting dressed from the top down now ? That the way they do it on the Mariners ? Mariners ? Gary 's got his eyes on the Sox . You mean the Sox got their eyes on him . How 's it feel ? All those scouts in the stands , you bend over to tie a shoelace , they make a note . How about a little respect , huh ? You are in the presence of the new Jackie Robinson . First 4400 to make the big leagues . Don 't worry about the scouts , man . I 'll float you some right down the middle . You just get into your rhythm , forget they 're even out there , all right ? I can 't blame him . Six scouts . I 'd be afraid I was gonna choke . I 'm not gonna choke . My turn ! No way ! No way ! Lawrence can 't serve them any better than that . Just give me a second . Man , he 's throwing him a beach ball . He 's scared , man . - What was wrong with that ? - What a loser . Follow through , buddy . Follow through . Oh , come on ! This time try taking the bat off your shoulder . Why don 't you try kissing my ass ! What 's your problem , Gary ? Navarro , get your head in the game ! Focus . I wanna see some contact . The majors ? Kid doesn 't look like he 's ready for rookie ball . Just shut up ! Want all of you to just shut the hell up and let me concentrate ! Whoa , Gary . Take it down a notch . Yeah , you 're a flake , aren 't you ? Go ahead . Take a swing at me . I 'll plant you where you stand . - I am not gonna hit you ! - Who said anything about hitting , man ? That 's it , Navarro ! You 're done for the day . I wanna see you in my office after practice . There 's nothing wrong with me . - There is nothing wrong with me . - Keep walking , mister . - There is nothing wrong with me ! - Keep walking , mister . Now . - Take it easy . - Don 't touch me ! This kid isn 't ready . This was a big waste of time . You gotta hit the showers . Ready for the bigs , my ass . What was wrong with that ? - You shut up ! - Just relax , buddy . Shut up ! Shut up ! You shut up ! You shut up ! Shut up ! There 's nothing wrong with me ! Well , it beats that ditch in the woods . Yeah . Not by much . It 's just a day or two . Let Isabelle get rested up , and push on the rest of the way . You got enough to make it to White Bird ? A new car , a trip to the emergency room . It 's gonna be close . All this running and hiding , sometimes I forget we haven 't done anything wrong . Three dead men in the woods might disagree . You wanna shower first , or should I ? You go ahead . - Give Isabelle her bottle , okay ? - Yeah . Yeah . That was you , wasn 't it ... who stopped those men in the woods ? Daddy sure would like to know . But you 're not gonna tell him , are you ? - What 's funny ? - Marmaduke . Can we get a dog ? Smooth how you slid that in there . No . Skouris . April ! Wow ! No , no , no . I 'm glad to hear from you . You 're my sister . It 's just ... It 's been a while , that 's all . No , we 're here , just having breakfast . Hang on a sec . Mrs Lennox must have forgotten her key . - I 'll get it . - No , no . No , I 'll get it . You just keep eating . I just have to let Maia 's teacher in . Coming ! One more sec . - Surprised ? - April ! - How 's it going , sibling ? - Good . - You look good . - Yeah . You , too . Thanks . What are you doing here ? The Pacific Northwest Body Art Expo . I have a booth . Don 't tell me you haven 't gotten your tickets yet . - No . - Hello . Oh , my God . You must be Maia . April Skouris , black sheep of the family . Di , you are so lucky . Look at this fabulous kid you got . And no labour , no stretch marks , no diapers . No crappy husband . Oh , wait . That was me . How come I never met you before ? - It 's complicated . - We 've been busy . Okay , we 'll stick with busy . Whatever . I 'm here now . So where are you staying while you 're in town ? This couch looks comfortable . It 's not an execution , Shawn . The last time I was on stage was my fourth grade spelling bee . These people are interested in us . They wanna hear what we have to say . You 'll think of something . Hello , my name is Shawn Farrell and I am one of the 4400 . Wow . A few months ago I never thought anyone would ever clap when I said that . But we didn 't know then what we know now . The future of mankind is in jeopardy . And right here , with your help , is where we start to set things straight . - Lf you join us ... - Mr Collier ? Mr Dravitt 's here for you . Thank you . ... the best versión of yourselves . Lan . Thanks for fitting me in . Interesting place you got here . I 'm not gonna be abducted by aliens , am I ? Now , lan . They weren 't aliens . - They were from the future . - Future , I know . So you told me . Ad nauseam . Look , it 's all the same sideshow to me . So , here I am . Here you are . What say we get down to business ? Lan Dravitt . Founder and CEO of Executive Projections , a multinational corporation based in Zimbabwe . If your company wants to do business in a third world country , they 'll show you the lay of the land . - It 's all perfectly legitimate . - Yeah , on the surface . But Dravitt 's real money comes from mercenary activity and arms dealing . Sold grenade launchers to the IRA , white phosphorus land mines to the Shining Path guerrillas in Peru . - So what 's he selling to Collier ? - Good question . But our observation teams can 't even tell you what time Collier takes lunch . Beyond the lobby , that place is a mystery . I mean , we 've sent our agents in disguised as air conditioning guys , fibre optics repairmen ... Yeah . We get a bug in , it 's yanked before the day is over . Probably sweeping the place every few hours . As far as Collier 's pow-wows with Dravitt , all we can do is guess . You think he 's stockpiling weapons ? Arms , anthrax . Nothing would surprise me . I mean , Collier 's all but said he 's at war with the US Government . Could be laying down a defence perimeter around the centre . That way if we ever have to go in there , he 'll be ready . Think Waco . Jonestown . Jarvis . I 'll send them down . Mr Navarro , I 'm Agent Skouris . This is Agent Tom ... Please . Please don 't talk . It 's too noisy . Your voices and your thoughts , they just all bleed together . The ER report said you were going on about ... No voices . Just concentrate on what you wanna ask me and I 'll hear you . A couple of weeks ago . It was during the game . I could hear everyone 's thoughts . At first it was just the pitcher , which was pretty good , actually , 'cause I knew everything he was gonna throw before he threw it . I went five for five . Two homers , two singles , and a double . That is exactly ... Yeah . Yeah , it was great when it started . But I can 't control it . First it was everyone on the team , and then everyone in the stands , and then , I don 't know , it was just everyone . It 's like this ocean of noise crashing around in my head . I want someone to make it go away ! That 's what I want . I was this close to making it to the majors when I got snatched . This time I 'm gonna make it . I have to make it . What ? So Navarro is really some kind of mind reader ? I believe telepath is the word you 're looking for . Well , call it something else if the word makes you uncomfortable , but the guy definitely knew what we were thinking . Interesting gift . I could think of a few practical applications for it . Dr Ostman gave him some haloperidol . It calmed him down . Quieted the noise some . So he can function as long as he 's on antipsychotic meds ? Well , we don 't have to fit him for any straitjacket , but he 's not gonna be hitting any knuckleballs either . Which is all he wants to do . Yeah , I 'll put NTAC Medical on it . If they can help him , they will . Great . - Kyle Baldwin . - Social security number ? There it is . Baldwin , nope . You 're not eligible to register . Sure I am . I got in last semester . I just took deferred admissión . Except your tuition hasn 't been paid . What are you talking about ? My dad sent a cheque . Nope . Baldwin . Glad I caught you . I 've got Navarro 's transfer forms right here . You sign them , he 's on his way to NTAC Medical . - Yeah , I will . But not just yet . - Why not ? We want to know what Collier and lan Dravitt are up to . A 4400 who can read minds just walked through the front door . You wanna use Navarro as a mole ? - Is that even legal ? - D.C. Cleared it . Well , how about ethical ? The guy 's asking us for help . Hell , he 's even begging us . And we 'll help him , but he 's gotta help us first . - What if he says no ? - Then you 'll get him to say yes . Excuse me . Can we get one more blanket ? - The one we have is kind of thin . - Yeah , well , they 're all kind of thin . But if you wanna bring it down , I 'll switch you . I think we might need both . You might think you need them , but you aren 't gonna get them . See , there 's only so many rooms and so many blankets . And you have your allotment . My baby is cold . Can I please have one more blanket so she doesn 't get sick ? I 'll give you $ 5 . I 'm a sucker for a pretty face . He wasn 't very nice to us , was he ? - Here . - Thank you . What if they catch me ? We 'll be monitoring you every step of the way . We plant a tiny transmitter receiver behind your ear under the skin . It takes 10 minutes . No scar . If things go south , we 'll be in there like the cavalry . When I was a kid my favourite show was The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Now , 30 years just gone in a snap . My little brother is retiring from the Tacoma police force at the end of the year . He 's 53 . Guys I played ball with , the ones that made it to the majors are signing autographs at card shows now . The game is all I have . Yeah , I get that . What , you play ball ? Senior year in college I blew my knee out trying to slide under a tag . - What position ? - Third base . Yeah . Another infielder , huh ? You miss it ? All the time . But what we do here , Gary , what we 're asking you to do for us ... it 's not the Worid Series but it 's pretty damn important . I do this for you guys ... you 're gonna fix me , right ? You have my word . Okay . Sorry about dinner . A new case . I 'm glad you didn 't wait for me . That 's what you 're sorry about ? Dinner ? Ask me how my first day of college was . - How was your first day of college ? - I didn 't have one ! Nobody paid my tuition . What are you talking about ? Of course I did . That 's ridiculous . I tried calling you a bunch of times . You didn 't answer your phone . I was in meetings all day . I know I wrote that cheque . - That 's great , Dad . - Sorry , Kyle . I must have forgot . We 've been talking about this for months . How could you forget ? Here . Bring it in tomorrow . I 'll send a note . Or I 'll talk to the registrar myself , whatever you want . Here . Kyle , don 't walk away from me ! Just ... Look ... I admit it . I 'm not denying it . I screwed up . - But work 's been a little crazy lately ... - The job . I 've been waiting for that one . It finally feels like old times around here . What 's this ? Lily , what is it ? Did you spend all the cash buying this stuff ? Then what ? Talk to me . The cash register at the front desk was open . And we needed food , and Isabelle needed diapers . - You stole money ? - It 's not like I planned it . I mean , I had to beg for a blanket , and the drawer was open , so ... He left you standing there - with the cash register open ? - No . No . He closed it . At least I think he did . I don 't know . I ... It wasn 't open , and then ... And then it was open . That still doesn 't make it right . That 's not how I live my life . Have you looked around ? 'Cause this isn 't how I planned to live my life , either . Look , I know it was wrong . I don 't need you to tell me it was wrong . Stop shaking your head ! Just eat something , okay ? It 's silly for all this food to go to waste . Go ahead . I 'm not hungry . - How much fun was that ? - I liked it . Thank you . So where have you two been ? Your note just said , " Out . " Lots of places . The pier . Pike street . And even the ferry . What have you done to ... - You didn 't . - I told you she 'd freak . - Relax , they 're rub-ons . - As in fake . - But they 're pretty , aren 't they ? - Oh , yeah . They 're very pretty . Now , why don 't you go get started on your homework ? I 'm in trouble . Do you at least like the shirt ? And by the way , you live in Seattle and your kid 's never heard of Kurt Cobain ? What 's wrong with you , Di ? Thank goodness you 're here to teach her all about tattoos and suicidal rock stars . And by the way , who gave you permissión to take her out of school ? I 'm her aunt . I didn 't know I needed permissión . Well , if you 're going to send her teacher home for the day , you do . Sitting at your kitchen table all day long ? Yeah , that 's a big loss . What are you keeping this kid locked away for ? If I wanted your opinion on how I 'm raising my daughter , I 'd ask . - Mommy ? - What 's wrong , sweetheart ? I think I have to throw up . What did you give her to eat ? - Anything she wanted . - Good going , Aunt April . Okay , guys . I 'm going in . Collier 's gonna want to meet you . You 're one of the 4400 . Anything you can learn about him is great , but our main target is lan Dravitt . See what you can find out about him and why he 's there . You have a two week supply of haloperidol . It should keep your mind clear , but hopefully you 'll be done in a couple of days . Excuse me . Cute . Nice shoes . Steer him over to the brochures . Welcome to the Centre . My name 's Devon . I 'm Gary Navarro . I 'm kind of interested in finding out what you guys do here . Well , I 'd be happy to show you around . Have you read Mr Collier 's book ? I didn 't have to . I lived it . I 'm one of the 4400 . Oh . Well , welcome home . Gary Navarro . Jordan Collier . It 's a real pleasure to meet you . Well , that 's a nice firm grip . I 'd expect nothing less of a promising second baseman . How did you know I played ball ? Well , it 's my business to know everything about the 4400 . So has anything shown up yet ? - An ability or ... - No , not me . I have a hard enough time hitting a split-finger fastball . It 's kind of disappointing , isn 't it ? All those years lost ... No abilities . Pass him off to Devon . Get back to Dravitt . Jordan , we need to talk . Absolutely , Shawn . First I 'd like you to meet a fellow returnee . Gary Navarro , Shawn Farrell . - Hi . - How are you doing ? Shawn here is a little luckier than you and I. He came back with quite a remarkable ability . Yeah , I 'm blessed , all right . See the halo around my head ? I really need to talk to you . Give us a second . Look , I 've been doing some poking around on the internet . I found out some stuff that you need to know . Because let me tell you , I really hope that you don 't know already . If it can be found on a search engine , believe me , I know it . You 're okay with this Dravitt guy ? Eyes on the prize , remember ? Doing business with our friend does not make us our friend . Dravitt 's not my friend . He 's a dangerous prick . I 'll meet you outside in 10 minutes . As soon as I get Gary squared away here , we 'll talk about it . Here you go . Hello ? Hello ? Are you all right ? - Whoa . Where was I ? - Far away , I think . First day meltdown ? I was just lost , and late , and begging my way into classes I don 't even want to take . No , not such a good day , then . " Introductory Survey of 19th Century Novellas . " Kill me now . Maybe it 'll enlighten you in ways you never could have imagined . Not likely . It was the only thing open this period . Well , this is Olin Hall . Take the stairs inside to your left . Thanks ! Maybe I 'll see you around . You never know . Hello , everybody . I 'm Wendy Paulson . Welcome to Intro to 19th Century Novellas . Is everyone in the right place ? I will speak to you after class . I can 't hear anything . - I 'll try to get closer . - Gary , what are you doing ? Collier and that kid , your nephew , I think they 're arguing about that guy Dravitt . Where are you ? Gary , go inside . - Getting a good eyeful ? - Look , I 'm just ... I ... Should we pull him out ? No , no , no . Not yet . Not yet . Maybe he can talk his way out of it . Now what the hell do you think you 're doing ? Let him go ! You should be more careful who you let in your manor , my son . We detained him as a professional courtesy . - Jordan , these guys are thugs . - No need for name-calling . We merely happened upon this gentleman in the process of spying on the two of you . I had a couple of questions for you , that 's all . I mean , I saw you guys were having an argument or something . What am I supposed to do ? Interrupt ? You wanna know what we were talking about ? Because it 's no big secret . - I 'll tell you what we were talking about . - Shawn , enough ! You 're gonna find I 'm tied up a lot of the time , Gary . If you have questions , any of my staff will be happy to help . - Yeah , sorry . Next time I 'll know better . - All right . Go on back inside . Careful where he wanders . No one 's getting between me and $ 30 million . - Richard , what is it ? What 's wrong ? - Police . - Oh , my God . I 'm so sorry . - I 'll tell them I took the money . You didn 't have anything to do with it . - Police . Open up . - Give us a minute ! Open up now ! They 're not after us . We 're okay . - Guys , are you there ? - Go ahead , Gary . Yeah , sorry I 've been so out of touch . They 've had me in these classes all morning . I haven 't even seen Collier all day . Or that other guy . Well , that 's okay . You just go where they tell you . Yeah , but I thought you said you wanted to know more about that money that Collier is shelling out . Where are my meds ? - Gary , what 's wrong ? - My meds , they 're gone . I don 't ... Let 's make sure we get that revised schedule as soon as possible okay ? That 'll be great . Excuse me . I had a prescription , some tranquilizers in my room , and now they 're gone . You don 't need those . You 've been conditioned to think you need them . Taking anything that suppresses your natural openness is counterintuitive to our programme . Maybe you should sit through the nutrition and purification lecture again . Did you hear that , Baldwin ? - They took the haloperidol . - Yes , Gary . I heard it . Do you wanna abort ? Do you wanna walk out of there ? Everything is just getting louder in my head already . It 's already getting worse . Voices are starting to bleed through the walls . Just calm down , Gary . We 'll come and get you if we need to . It 's your call . - Gary , talk to me . - Okay . You guys are gonna hold up your end of this deal , right ? Yes , of course . Okay . Okay . I 'll hold up my end and I 'll hang in as long as I can . Good . We 'll hang in with you . Now listen , Gary , someone 's gonna be on this channel 24 / 7 . You remember ? Yeah , right . Right . I read The Secret Sharer last night . Just like your syllabus said . That 's a good start . Well , not just the first 20 pages . I got really into it . I read the whole thing . Nineteenth century novellas not quite the hell on earth you expected ? Definitely wasn 't boring . I 've got a lot of questions , though . Okay . Well , I have office hours , Wednesdays 1 : 00 to 4 : 00 . Okay , yeah . I 'll try to stop by . Or we could run by the Coop and grab some coffee . - Like right now ? - I like talking about Joseph Conrad . It 's why I picked this for a living . Where did you learn to do all this ? 'Cause mom never taught us to cook . I don 't know . I just learnt how . Had to be better than you at something . Aunt April , do you have any kids ? Nope . No kids . - Are you married ? - I used to be . Ask your mom what she thought of my ex-husband . - Don 't start . - You didn 't like him ? Neither did April , apparently . She only stayed with Trevor for what , seven months ? You were hostile from day one . You never gave him a chance . I don 't really think he deserved much of a chance . He was kind of a moron . He was 22 . Show me one guy who isn 't a moron at 22 . He knew you hated him . And that didn 't make it any easier for us to stay together . Come on . You can 't keep blaming that on me . - I mean , just grow up . - Okay , this was a mistake . I thought it was a good idea to come here , but obviously I was wrong . I 'll go pack . There 's a little hotel up the street . - No ! - It 's okay , honey . We 'll still see each ... But the power 's gonna go out there tonight and you won 't have any lights . What is she talking about ? Can I please be excused ? - I don 't understand . - I just hate this psychoanalyst crap . I should have had coffee . How long do we have to do this for ? I just don 't get it . Mr Navarro , is something wrong ? This is no good . I need my haloperidol . - Where 's Collier ? - Mr Collier 's in a meeting . Mr Navarro . Mr Navarro . - Gary , what 's wrong ? - I 've just got to talk to Collier ! That 's not a good idea , Gary ! Mr Navarro , he 's in a meeting ! Make it stop . Please , make it stop . Make it stop . I need my medication . Whatever 's eating you , old son , we 'll make it stop . Count on that . A 4400 who can read minds . So you do have an ability . You shouldn 't have lied to me , Gary . You mean to tell me that this guy knows what I 'm thinking ? Because I do not like anyone inside my head but me . Jordan , this guy 's one of us . We can 't just stand here and let him get killed . Nobody 's killing anyone . First , we determine what our man here knows . And then we discuss his fate . 'Cause there are things I know that could get you killed ! That could get all of you killed ! Call Jarvis ! Tell her we 're going in ! - Look , lan ... - Shut up ! Shut up now ! Hi , I 'm Evan . Welcome to The 4400 Centre . - Second level is not open to visitors . - Yeah ? We 're not visitors . Hey , look , buddy . I 've got a badge , too . And this is private property . What the hell is he doing to him ? Let him go or so help me I 'll splatter your brains all over your highly polished floor . Now that is enough ! Drop that weapon ! Now ! - How the hell did you get in here ? - You don 't sound so happy to see us . - Now , what in the hell is this ? - NTAC agents . I don 't appreciate the government interfering in my business . Maybe you should be more careful who you do business with . They 're not buying weapons . They 're planning a coup overseas . Some tiny country . You sent a spy in here , Uncle Tommy ? Good job ! You almost got us all killed ! You , too , Mr Dravitt . Well , it 'll be interesting to see if your friend 's impressions will stand up in court . I guess I 'm the one who should be more careful who I do business with . Shawn , you can come with us if you want . Great . I 'll tell your mother you said hello . Gary , you should have come to me first . I 'd have treated you better than they ever will . We 're at war , here . Don 't pick the losing side . Look at the cute little baby . I think somebody wants to try your toy , Walt . I think you 're right . - Hi . - Hi . Put her back in the car . - Why ? - Now , please . What 's your problem ? That little boy was being sweet with her . I just didn 't want anybody getting hurt . Hurt ? Who 's gonna get hurt ? What if she doesn 't want to give the toy back ? What 's gonna happen then ? Don 't look at me like you don 't know what I 'm talking about . - Those three men in the woods . - They wanted us dead . You saw what happened to them . That was Isabelle . We both know it and there 's no use in pretending otherwise . Whatever Isabelle does , she does it out of love for us . - She 's our daughter , Richard . - I know she is . I love her right back . But she 's something else , too . And I wish to God I knew what that was . What is it ? What 's wrong ? I 'm fine . So what ? So Collier planned to spend $ 30 million funding mercenary activity in Säo Tomé ? They 've had three coups since their independence in ' 75 . My guess ? Collier was trying to buy number four . Did Gary happen to hear why Collier 's so interested in an island off the west coast of Africa ? Without his medication , we 're lucky to have got that much out of him . Yeah . But we do know that Collier thinks he 's headed towards a conflict with someone . NTAC , the entire government , I don 't know . He installs a friendly government in Säo Tomé . It could have been a place to go when things heat up . More like a homeland for the 4400 . Too bad you can 't prosecute a man for delusions of grandeur . They 're not delusions if you can make them come true . We 're always one step behind Collier because we keep seeing him as some kind of cult nut . What we should be asking ourselves is before Collier was abducted , did he ever set his mind on something and not get it done ? They didn 't make him any dumber in that ball of light . Yeah , anyway , we wanted to know what Collier was thinking . Gary found out for us . Time to turn him over to NTAC Medical , right ? Soon . Soon ? The NSA is cc 'd any time we register a new 4400 ability . They have been leaning on D.C. To borrow Gary for an op they 've got planned . But no more cloak and dagger stuff . He 'll sit in on a few conferences . You know how it is with diplomats . They don 't always say what they think . That wasn 't the agreement I made with him . The terms have changed . Gary 's too valuable . I gave him my word . You 're turning me into a liar . You 've been in the game almost 20 years . My guess is you 've committed all the seven deadly sins . Just like the rest of us . I should have let him stay with Collier . He might have used him , but he would have helped him , too . Don 't you ever use me again ! All I wanted was to play ball . You guys promised to help , but you can 't do that , can you ? We 're worried about the 4400 . It seems more and more like they should be worried about us . You know that bar , Mel 's ? Corner of Lancaster and 3rd ? You feel like joining me ? We don 't go to bars . Well , I 'm going tonight with you or without you .

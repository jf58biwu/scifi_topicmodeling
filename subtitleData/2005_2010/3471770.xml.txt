 Come inside . Come on in , boys . - The crowd 's waiting outside unity hall - It 's on . like it wasn 't nearly freezing temperatures . It feels like the only one not here yet is the man himself . - Is he doing the God thing ? - Oh , I hope not . God 's not popular right now . He doesn 't care . He likes God . And God likes him . Detail ! He 's here . The king approaches . Sir , I 'd feel much better about this if I could see your speech first . Stop asking . - Where 's Reverend Samuels ? - Reverend Samuels isn 't here yet . Not like him to miss a crowd . - We 'll just have to start without him . - He 's supposed to give the benediction . We could hold for another 15 minutes . It 's cold out there . The people are cheering . We 'll have my son do it . You 're not gonna be warm enough . You have the entire country listening , and you choose today not to let me see your speech ? I 'd love to ... If I 'd written one . - He didn 't write a speech . - It 'll come . It 's not popular to speak of God . But I do so now and publicly because I feel blessed . I am ... blessed . I look at this city that we built through industry , through ingenuity , through war and sacrifice , and I feel that blessing . This city is the dream of a half-century , and this morning ... we bring that dream into the day . We have built Shiloh . There 's no surprise . I knew this day would come . I knew this land , these territories , once at war , factions fractured , were meant to be one nation , together ... at peace . When I first looked out at the ruins that would become Shiloh , there was nothing . Ashes . An empty shell of a city bombed ten times over by three armies . But I looked ... and my eyes opened ... and I saw unity hall , right here as it stands today ... Pay attention , boys . Your father died fighting for this . - I looked and I saw people ... - Damn fool . former enemies working together ... rebuilding - I 'll get it . - I saw hospitals , streets , traffic , jewelry shops , Police Station . Rude , old men stealing your cab . Trucks selling 50 different kinds of ice cream . Someone 's pulling into the shop . ... was here already . Under one flag , united . Under one king ... strong . Morning . - Are you Jessie ? - My mom . Didn 't you get a name ? What 's the problem ? The car . It used to work , and then it stopped . We 've got the ceremony on inside if you wanna watch it . You look like you know what you 're doing . My dad taught me . Is he around ? He died in the war . You need a new hose . Will that take long ? A new one would . The dead has arisen . Look at you . - It was just a cracked hose . - To me that was a broken car . You have a little something on you . Here . - I can 't charge you for that . - It 's your time I owe you for . I 'll meet you halfway . This broken thing has been in my pocket for the last six months . Should 've taken it to a shop , but ... if you can fix it , you deserve it . - Thank you , sir . - You are very polite , David . It 's the way I was raised . Do something about that before you grow up . And that 's when they came . I felt a shadow above me . I looked up and saw a great swarm of butterflies . And they circled around me like leaves in a storm , floating , soft . Soft landing upon my head like a crown , a living crown . God 's signal ... to begin . I pray ... as I take my seat in this great new capital , to be worthy of his anointment and of your trust . Like the king himself , who rose from meager beginnings as a soldier to a monarch beloved by his kingdom , the new capital at Shiloh has risen up from the wreckage of war , and become a beacon of hope for our people . There you go , boys . Our taxes went into rebuilding that full city for twenty years . At least you 'll be able to tell your grandkids , " I saw it happen . " Except for David . He missed it . - Who was in the shop , anyways ? - Reverend Samuels . - Who wants pancakes ? - I do . I 'm starving . The only dark clouds on this day are reports of tension in the north . Fears that border disputes with Gath could escalate . Certainly king Silas , veteran of the unification wars himself , will do what he can to prevent another war . Seriously , bro ... I swear , man , you moms makes the best friggin ' brownies , man . What 's in these ? Guilt . Gimme a light . Easy , killer . I promised mom I 'd take care of you , no smoking . Damn Goliath . Every day another round just to remind us we 're outgunned . We 're talking about it . It must be working . I got a pool going on when you think they 'll blow today . - Actually , it should be any second . - You don 't know that . - I kinda do . - It 's a different time every day . - It 's a completely random event . - Any second . If you weren 't my brother I 'd think you 're a spy . How 'd you know that was gonna happen ? Have another brownie . You guys hear ? A squad got pinched . At Foxland forest . They got out alone somehow , no air support . Bastards ambushed them . - They dead ? - Not all . They took hostages . A platoon was ambushed . Foxland . 12 dead , 2 hostages . Over the border . They go too far ... They 'll find I 'm willing to meet them and go further . We don 't negotiate for hostages , much as we want to , much as our soldiers deserve it . War asks the heart to freeze at room temperature . Send for the families . It was the 127th . I 'm sorry , sir , it 's ... Call the ambassador to Gath . Get them back . Get it done . You can 't . We don 't negotiate for hostages , as you said . We can 't now . Then what do we do ? No one goes after the hostages . We don 't need any more losses . In the last 18 months , anyone within 200 yards of a Goliath was a loss . This comes from the top . - Anyone on the move ? - How do you walk quiet , Shep ? - What are you doing at here ? - Nothing . Anything moving out there ? No , a tank on 5-ko rolled to 50 yards off the ditch . I thought I saw a shelter go up . - Dude ... what are you doing ? - I can 't run in these . You think it 's them ? The hostages ? I don 't know . I just have a feeling . They could be hiding ' em behind the tanks , but ... they 'll court-marshal you for this . - If you live that long . - Don 't worry . - I 'm calling your brother , man . - Don 't . He 'll just try and stop me . Give me a wrench . What are you gonna do , change their oil ? Slowly . Okay , okay . Wait , wait , wait . Okay , come on . Come on . Stay with me . Stay with me . Come on , come on . Get up . Come on . I 'll cover . - Can you get him to lookout ? - I think so . He 's getting up . You seeing this ? You dumb son of a ... If you 'd have died , I 'd ... - What 's this ? - It 's your court-martial . Shepherd ! You were given an order . How is he ? A cut to the head and a scar to remember it by , but he 'll be fine . That 's Jack Benjamin . You saved the King 's son . Ice trucks . It means fish tonight . Probably king salmon , given the season . No , it doesn 't mean fish . - Then what ? - Lamb . It 's a hero 's welcome . Heroes get red meat . I 'd do with a nice pistachio crust , if asked . No chance . Queen Rose hates lamb . Ever since she spent her summers on her uncle 's farm . Everyone knows that . Do they ? Do they know what color panties she picks for Thursdays too ? 'day , sirs . Names ? David Shepherd . Here to see ... Here to see everyone , sir . - That 's in the paper ? - No , that 's in all the paper , sir . You 're gonna have to settle a bet for us on what 's being served for you tonight . - Tonight ? - You know , at your banquet . - The menu , ma 'am . - Ah , the menu . " Squab , herb polenta , arrabiata for the vegetarians . " It 's good , good . It 's perfect . But ... take off the lamb . What about our guest of honor ? Who 's making sure he 's presentable ? We have Jack on that , ma 'am . - Put someone on Jack . - Yes , ma 'am . I can 't believe you came out tonight . I mean , you almost died out there . I didn 't . That calls for more living . Thomasina . Oh , my love . Don 't be jealous . Come , we 're meeting Shepherd . He 's coming to court . - I thought that was tomorrow . - It is tomorrow . That used to hang up in my room . It kept me up at night . You saved my life . We can skip all that . - Besides , you 're the darling today . - Sorry , sir ? I know . I get taken hostage and almost get killed , and they 're throwing you a party . Mysteries of the palace . I wish they wouldn 't . I 'm not even really sure why I 'm here . Technically so I could give you a tour ... an hour ago . Sorry . You 're here to get shown off , to take a picture with my father , and then get sent back . Thanks for serving your country . Is that what you 're wearing tonight ? I 'll have something of mine sent over . I think you 're taller than me . I 'll send the tailor with it . - There 's a tailor here ? - My father likes suits . Gath . Now 's the time to make a push forward . - Take the valley . - You 've been saying for 3 years . Last presented ? - Perry . - Sorry . June 10th , this year . Unapproved by you , sir . " We don 't attack , we respond . " Instigation is Gath 's game . " Which is why they 're winning . This war has been a cancer on our economy . If your valley can get us out , I support it . We can 't extend the border now for the same reason we couldn 't in June . Were outgunned and lack public support . Polling shows public opinion in favor of aggressive measure since the kidnapping . - Negatives . - Could draw an offensive . - World press would have a field day . - Reverend won 't like it . Reverend doesn 't like anything . Still thinks I owe him because he swore me in . They 've blasted us from those hills for years . There 's never been a better time to make them stop . They 're demoralized and our troops are chomping at the bit . They all want to take out a tank now . Good . Let them . Let them . Push back enough to let Gath know we 're done taking punches . It 's time to do something . Please say that clears the agenda . There are petitions , sir . We have four . Court calls miss Michelle Benjamin , petition on health care . I think we 'll only have time for one . Sir , you 've heard proposals to advance public health care before I know ... Most from you . Noah Tanner . Six years old and needs a new heart . Given the current options , patients like Noah are left to treatments older than his parents . He needs a new heart as badly as we need reform . - I 've outlined a plan ... - I recall my own daughter treated for childhood illnesses very well by the exact level of care offered to each of our citizens but deemed lacking by you . Your daughter had advantages many don 't . She had parents of privilege to watch over her day and night . As they do now when they tell her to move on from an obvious impasse . Sorry , puppy . This push on Gath . Make it loud . Time to end this damn war . Write down " He governed patiently ... " and well , " then ran home for a shower . " I spend more time on conflicts then I do on tax reforms . - Why aren 't you ready ? - My darn cell phone . I had it with me on my trip yesterday and I ... I last saw it with my socks . Your daughter is livid , by the way . - She spent months on that tax thing . - Health care . - Why with your socks ? - So it wouldn 't get banged up . It 's my fault . I should never have trusted anything that important with that new secretary . Why is it that pretty people are always so bad with details ? King of all I survey , and I still can 't find an office chair that doesn 't get my back spasms . You 're an old soldier . Don 't complain . Your pills are on the counter . I don 't like pills . I 'd rather have wine . Wine makes your eyes droop and you have to look nice for the pictures . Is this really your first time in the capital ? I missed the eighth grade class trip . Mono . Do you have any family here tonight ? Is your dad proud of you ? My dad died fighting in the unification war . What about your mother ? Is she here ? My mother never really approved of me join the army . Why is that ? You might 've heard about my father . Ladies and gentlemen . Shall we ? Start on the left and work our way over . Now back again . You handle the hounds well , private . I have six older brothers . Have fun . I 'd like a large glass of something really expensive . Thank you . We celebrate bravery tonight . Tonight , I 'm as sure of our cause as I was the day we founded our great nation . And if that idea was over ... Reverend Samuels , it means so much ... Let me get a drink in before asking me for things , would you ? We had little more than hope and a bad idea . Two key ingredients for global change . And that 's when they came . Like a ... a shadow overhead . I looked up and ... saw a great swarm of butterflies circling above my head like ... leaves in a storm . Soft and landing like ... a crown , a living crown on my head . God 's signal to begin . Still with the butterflies . Doesn 't he ever get tired of that one ? He 'll tell it as long as they want to hear it . And so will you someday . If it 's good enough for the hero , it 's more than enough for an old preacher . The Lord 's world is great . Very , very small . To the hero who can fix anything . I don 't know if I count as a hero . What is this ? A man hiding at the bar is a man who doesn 't want to be at the party . I guess I 'm just more used to the front . Take a good look around you . You ... come on . I had a banquet in your name . You 're drinking a single malt the likes of which God himself only takes out of the cabinet but once a year . You have your choice of ladies all very interested in your attention . You like the one in red ? Now your nights will not always be this easy . Enjoy . Just watch out for the cameras . You 're not supposed to be playing that . That piano was a gift to my father from the prime minister of Austeria . This piano is a Broadwood Grand . 1848 . The same year Liszt wrote this . Closest I 've ever come to one is a picture on the Internet . You can call security but I 'm finishing first . I thought you were a mechanic . Wouldn 't have pegged you for a musician . I wouldn 't have pegged you for a snitch . Well they 're all looking for you . Sir , this is Mr. And Mrs. Acharen . Excuse me . You know him . The kid . I 'm not sure if I know anybody anymore . Speak in riddles , Reverend , you 're liable to never get your point across . So you 're going to pretend that I don 't know . About Gath ? I spoke my piece clearly . The offensive could put an end to this war . If you 're against it , tell it to your flock . I don 't need your permission to defend my country . Sit . It 's time we spoke plainly , you and I. Yes , sir . Plainly doesn 't come with " sirs " . Quit it . I owe you a lot . More than I can say . You don 't have children , do you ? I 'm an uncle . Then you don 't know . You saved my son 's life . That means I owe you mine . Just tell me what you want and it 's yours . They already offered me a reward that 's way more than I can spend . You 're a young man . Smart . You must have some goals . I 'm a man with position offering you a thank you . Even if you ask for half my kingdom , as the saying goes . Well speak up , or you 're liable to get a car you can 't afford the insurance on . Half my kingdom it is . You have no idea how to dance , do you ? Not even a little bit . You know , this really seemed like a good idea a minute ago . There are a lot of people watching you right now . You know that . Now , yes . Very , very clear . Follow my lead . I 'm sorry about before . I took my bad day out on you . Princessing is hard work ? Health reform , actually . I showed them a way to help people and got told it was inconvenient . I 'm trying to get a six-year-old a new heart . What ? Happiness suits her , Abner . Who knew ? Him . - Yes , sir ? - I 'll not forget what he said and when he said it . - Yes , sir . - Don 't make a show of it . - And the wife ? - No , no need . He 'll be trouble . You watch . I know the type . The only way to deal with him is a bullet . Please , he 's an infant . He 's got everyone eating out of his hand . Cameras are wearing themselves out . No one 's talking about the war . This court needs a new face to look up to . We can use him . Something 's here for us . Good kid , that David . Perfect timing . Medium scrambled on whole wheat toast , no butter on pain of death . A rare full house . Eat . No sign of it , ma 'am . They checked the cars ? And the luggage . The service is asking for an account of the information on there . The queen 's cell phone . It 's got the email , birthdays , and bad spelling of every person comprising society in this country . I think they 're more concerned with national security . You know I don 't like getting involved with politics . So come , let 's keep looking before they call in the national guard . It 's gotta be somewhere . Did mom lose her mind and find Thomasina to fix everything , or was it the other way ? Sort of a chicken / egg question . - The chicken or the egg ? - I was told to come ? Chicken , egg ? Are we still using that expression ? Given the overwhelming evidence in favor of evolutionary theory , I need to make a royal official declaration . The answer is roundly an egg . Not negating God in whom I trust more than that damned Reverend will ever know . Just recognizing the change occurs , thank said God , and that the egg would have to have been the natural improvement on whatever near-chicken mother hatched it and discovered that her young was delightfully different from herself . Evolution is just one of God 's many tools , like me . The only real and lingering question being ... How do you like them , first-come eggs ? Is there something you 'd like me to do ? He 'd like you to sit and eat . My father insists on making breakfast . It makes him feel like his kids are still five . When you were small ... and manageable , and I prefered it that way . I can 't stay long . I have to report back to base this morning . No . You 're not going back to the front . You 've been transferred to Shiloh . Military liaison to the press office . The press likes you . Captain Shepherd . Captain . You 're an officer now . Hell of a time to lose your powers of speech . You 're going on air in an hour . There a problem ? I 'm not sure I can answer that without insulting my king . Your king hears insults with alarming regularity . I just don 't think I 'm cut out for the city , sir . Walter , next time you hear Captain Shepherd call me " sir , " I want you to take out your sidearm and shoot him . What have you got against our city ? Well I 'd probably have an apartment the size of my dog 's shed at home . And ... no one talks about the war here . My company 's fighting just a few hours from here and ... it 's as if nothing 's happening except on TV . Plus the city sort of smells like trash . I 'm not gonna tell you what to do . But you ... could do good here . Hope lies in bravery . We need hope . Give us a shot . Yes , sir . I can 't believe I 've been in this many cars in three days . I could 've sworn that I gave it to you . I 'm so sorry , ma 'am . I don 't know where it went . A cell phone full of state secrets and private lines . Let 's hope not far . I 'll go tear up my bed room again . - No luck ? - It 's your fault . I blame the grief . You really had me worried . - You promised me you 'd never die . - I kept my promise . See ? Look , how long are we gonna have to suffer that one ? He 's harmless . He 's a cocker spaniel . That cocker spaniel just got the best post in the military . Hell , I was the one taken hostage . That should 've been my job . Instead I 'm being brought in for questioning . More discipline ? You don 't do yourself any favors with your nightlife . They 're saying things about the kidnapping . That it was my fault the squad was ambushed . That I was impulsive and went in without a support team . - Did you ? - Of course not . I called for overwatch as soon as I got the order . The woods were crawling . We had support . At least when we went in . And then ... The shooting started . And we were alone . I lost men . We had support . Please . Talk to him . They could bring me up on charges . You know I don 't like to get involved with politics . But ... If I were to suggest something , I 'd say let them . - Let them court-martial me ? - Why not ? Truth outed slowly is rembered longest . So sit through their meetings . They 'll see what 's what soon enough and then they 'll have to cover you with so many medals and apologies . You 'll be stuffed from all the banquets in your high honor . Be patient , Jack . It 'll all come out in the wash . Probably along with my damn cell phone . And sadly he suffered a coronary while jogging near his home . Minister of energy faulks was a 15-year servant of our government and a patriot . King Silas will be visiting with his family after the funeral . Listen , I don 't think I 'm gonna make it back home this weekend . I thought you had some leave coming . - Did you get in trouble ? - Sort of . Turn on the tv . We also have some news from the front . Now ladies and gentlemen , you know we can 't tell you too much . But here to tell you what we can , we have our new military liaison . Some of you may know of him already . Let me introduce : Captain David Shepherd . - What 's going on with you ? - Mom , I gotta go . They made him a monkey ! - What ? - There 's a package here for you . Look , look ! Is anyone else really sick of that picture ? Can we turn that off ? Thanks . Cool . Does this mean no more action for you ? You 'll be staying here in Shiloh ? Look , I only had , like , ten minutes of briefing this morning , but I 'm pretty surey just want me to read what 's on the prompter , so ... How about I just say yes and we get straight to it . An offensive was issued two hours ago by king Silas . At present , we have troops advancing across the neutral zone into Gath territory . We have reports that Gath has retreated its armor units . Is this in response to the kidnappings ? I think it 's in response to everyone wanting this damn war over already . This is embarrassing . We could pull him . He 's perfect . Watch . What about Jack Benjamin 's involvement with the ambush of the 127th ? As far as I know , Captain Benjamin 's involvement was as a victim . Is it true there 's an early inquiry into his negligence ? I have no official information on that . But from personal knowledge I can state that ... that 's a load of bullshit put out by people trying to cash in on tragedy . Men died in that ambush . Try and show some respect . - Next question . - Thank you , Captain . Little too much time around soldiers . Any last comments ? No ? Actually ... one ... last thing . I have a report that there 's progress on a promising new health care petition . To expand ... You know , coverage . Which I guess will , I guess will benefit ... - everyone . - Thank you for that update . Flying colors . How are you feeling ? I thought I was gonna vomit the whole time . Lucky you didn 't . Come , sir . There 's a call for you . You got my package ? You seriously spend your whole reward on beer and video games ? You 're sick ! You have a sickness ! All right , How you holding up , captain ? I 've been trying to get out ever since I got here . You 're in the capital . You 're dancing with the princess . Nobody 's shooting at you . I just thought I should be out there with you guys . Are you kidding me ? That 's sweet . No , kid , you need to be scooping this up with both hands , okay ? You 're living the good life . You deserve it . What 's going on , Eli ? We 're looking a preparation for full-scale invasion . We have to attack first . They 're coming for us . They haven 't fired . It could be a retreat . We were told to expect an official message from them any minute . Recalling all your plans from our airspace is a message . " We 're going to push you into the sea . " Your brother 's fine . You 'll call him later . Message from the premier of Gath , sir . Son of a bitch . It 's a peace treaty . They 're offering us a truce . I ... owe you a thank you for the free publicity . I just thought I 'd drop off a note . You hoped I wouldn 't be home . This treaty is half your doing . You really should be out celebrating . You haven 't seen ... Turn on your TV . You don 't have a TV . What do you think all that noise is outside ? I just thought that was the city . Come on . Come on , we 're going . Here . Beautiful , isn 't it ? Do you remember the inauguration of Shiloh ? When we moved to the capital , the celebration ? Of course . I watched it with my family . We were on our way to it all driving , and , my dad sees this truck . And he stops the entire cavalcade . He just can 't get over it . This ... ice cream truck here where there was nothing before someone dreamt it . Just ashes , ruins . He hugged me to hide that he was crying . Nobody else saw , but ... I think it wasn 't real to him until that moment . It was freezing out and he bought us all rocket pops . That was when I realized that the human will can take ashes and turn it into ice cream , this city is about progress . This is what we 've been fighting for this entire time . Dancing in the streets and you 're here draining my wine cellar . Isn 't it great ? Peace in our lifetimes . - All thanks to the cocker spaniel . - Good news for all of us . Especially for me . You transferred me . Moved me to an intelligence desk in the capital . - Promotion to major . - Then you heard . Congratulations . That you took me off active duty . That is a demotion . And admission of guilt couches an honor . " That Jack couldn 't really handle the war . Nearly got himself killed . " Let 's move him to a desk where it 's safe . " All while you prop him up on a stage . Come then . There 's enough fair hair to go around . You really mean to do this now ? If I 'm gonna be king and telling the butterfly story , I need to be a war hero in command of my company . I can 't do that from the sidelines . You believe what they 're saying ? That ambush wasn 't my fault . - I know that . - Then what ? I fought for you . Commanded . I have the respect of everyone except the one who owes it to me most . Is it my reputation ? " The party prince ? " Is that it ? None of that matters . That ... it 's not who I am . If only it was . What would I give for a playboy who couldn 't keep it in his pants , and who runs through women ? But what I have ... is a son who shows no interest in them . You thought I didn 't know ? I 've been keeping pictures of our family out of the free press for years . What you do at night with your boys after your show of skirt chasing is a disgrace . If you were my second son , I wouldn 't care . But for a king , it 's not possible . Not possible . We give what we want when we want power . Believe me . Now you want to show me you have the heart to be king ? Show me you can control it . Wrestle it to the ground . Numb it with ice . But you cannot be what God made you , not if you mean to take my place . Celebrate . It 's what you 're good at ... Read it back . " And it happened " that Silas king forged an accord of peace with Gath . " The dancing in the streets " could be felt even up into the king 's chambers , " shaking his pen as he signed his name . " Nice turn , Perry . We made legend today . Thank you , sir . Who comes to the king uncalled . Why aren 't you out on a parade float somewhere ? No sign of it letting up either . Even Michelle is out having fun for once . Was a good gamble . We scared them into peace . We can build again . I was thinking this truce might not be the best thing for the country right now . I just signed the treaty . Which makes a perfect opportunity to invade . They 'd never see it coming . We only attacked to scare them into peace . Everything this country needs is wrapp in peace . You heard the parades . The people want peace . They can have it , say ... in a year . Then ... you could end the war . Crossgen has too much invested in the military right now . This war needs to continue . This isn 't some government contract . Building a bridge or a pipeline or helmet . People will die . You can see that building . Of course you can . I made sure this room faced it . You may have built this country , but I paid for it . I ... I handed you your crown . I repaid that debt many times . Don 't forget all you sacrificed to get where you are right now . Gave up that whore you loved . Made me your brother all so you could have my money at your back . You knew the cost . - And if I refuse ? - One call is all it takes to pull our gold from your treasury . Everything you built will collapse . By lunch , those parades will be riots . Your banks will be on fire . You 'll have more death on your head than would come from any war . One more year . Then sign whatever you want . Find a way . And how do I live with myself ? The same as you always have . You never sleep either . The family needs 24-hour care . You all right , sir ? Quarterly reports are the death of innovation . Can you get me ready a car ? I woke you . I was up . Long night ? Sit . I made soup . - What kind ? - The kind you like . Your back 's bothering you again ? I 'll get your pillow . Why do I ever leave ? I 'm happy when I 'm here . - Sad when I 'm gone . - Sadness can be useful too . Easy , puppy . Daddy 's here . Easy . We 're getting hammered out here ! Where 's our air support ? We 'll have to take extreme measures to compensate . Take them head-on , hit the capital . We should prepare for heavy losses . Press conference in two hours . At the front , you 'll announce this . I 'll need the Reverend to give the benediction after . " Re-engaged ? " We 're invading ? But we had peace . You don 't want this . If you invade , there 'll be no end . There has to be some way you can rescue this . One tank and he thinks he can fashion history . There 's a lot of generals there who think differently . They can 't tell you how to move people . You can do that . Talk to Gath face-to-face . Call out to the premier directly . - You have to try . - Do not presume to tell us what to do . We are king and we do as seems right in mine eye . Say otherwise again and we will snap your neck right now . And next time you touch my daughter , don 't do it on camera . There 'd have been a much different in the paper this morning if it didn 't come to me first . You and I , we 've had our differences . But on the people we agree . They 're gonna need you . I want you to get on the air . Lead them in a national prayer . Declare a fast . Band them together like the old days . I won 't do that . - You 're refusing your king ? - You are not my king . Not anymore . Not after what you have done . Or do you still want to pretend that I don 't know ? The kidnappings . Those soldiers . The ambush that ended 12 lives . That was you . You recalled their air support . You allowed an assault on your own soldiers . You sacrificed your own son . Jack was never supposed to be anywhere near there . They are all your children . I had do something . We needed a strike . I couldn 't get the people behind it . I only wanted a chance at peace . And you couldn 't take that either . I bring a message . Since you have cast aside the word of the Lord , he has cast you side as king . He grants you no more favors . He protects what you love no longer . God wishes a man after his own heart . You have none . He will find another . That 's what he says ? - Then to hell with God . - You are just a man now . Try to live like one ... for long as you can What happened ? Goliath 's took out the entire front . We got hit hard . Where 's Eli ? There he is . How 's the big city ? He tell me something . How did you know those tanks weren 't gonna shoot ? Come on , don 't make me die before I know . Their tank teams like to use the exhaust stacks to heat up their field rations . They drop the entreein when they 're idling . You can hear ' em gun the engines to blow the packs out . They always do it before they shell . So they can have a hot meal in peace while we ... While we got our heads in the sand . It 's not good out there . It 's gonna get worse . I don 't know what to do . You 'll figure something out . You 're always good at fixing things . They 're so much bigger than me there . Bigger than you ? You 're the kid in front of the tank . You 're a hero . I 'm not what you think I am . I 'm not a hero . That whole picture 's a lie . But you stood up to them . When they took that picture , I wasn 't standing up . I was surrounded . They had me , so I surrendered . I dropped my gun . My grenade went off , I got a lucky shot in . It wasn 't even luck , it was stupid , I surrendered . Everyone thinks I 'm brave ... But I 'm not . Be brave now . Sir , you 'd better see this . You want blood ? Come here and take it ! It 's fresh ! Still warm from the life that just left it . The blood of my brother . So take it ! Take his blood and call it enough . If you need more , take mine . Do it ! I surrender . Shoot me and call that enough . Or can one of you come down here ... and show me your face ? Show me that you 're more than tank , metal , and shell . That you 're human like we are . That you breathe , that you bleed . That you feel and feel pity . That you live for more than our deaths . Come . Any of you who have lost a brother . Come and tell me it 's enough . Lost his mind . - Get a gun on him . - Yes , sir . Hold . Hold . We looked into our hearts and found a new opportunity for peaceful dialogue and truce . I personally sent captain Shepherd , our bravest soldier , to extend the offer of mutual surrender to Gath . Where is David Shepherd now ? Captain Shepherd is suffering his own loss today . I hope you 'll extend to him the privacy he and his family deserve . " Opportunity for peaceful dialogue ? " What are you going to do about this ? I 'm going to hold peace talks with the Gath leadership in the vineyard . Shepherd 's stunt was too grand a gesture . My hands are tied . You planned it , the whole thing , didn 't you ? Fed your words to that upstart and sent him out there . I 'd kill him myself if I could . I hope you 're happy . You just traded one war for another . Pen which , " The king 's brother-in-law came " and congratulated him on the truce . " Nice to have my own country back . Call the treasury . Pull the gold . We 'll see how long they cheer for him when they 're starving . Then we handle Shepherd . Royal guard ? Palace finest . - Are you arresting me ? - More like delivering an invitation and a small housewarming gift . Took the liberty of installing it for you . Be seeing you I suppose , sir . And we 'll be receiving the peace negotiators from Gath , here at the vineyard . It 's my proud task to make them all comfortable during these historic talks . We found it , ma 'am . - Your cell phone . - Lord bless , I lost it days ago . National security disaster . Where was it ? Please just tell me , for goodness sakes . I have no secrets from the press . Jack 's car . A maid found it in the backseat . It was with this . So then I did give it to you . Unless this belongs to someone else . I lose more good secretaries that way . Is that off the record ? Well , go ahead . I owe you one . But please just promise to make him look rakish . I 'll do my best . Silas and his time has passed . Being king is a young man 's game and he 's grown old . This is the time for bold action . And for action , we need to know we have a replacement at the ready . What say you ? There are no words . Your brother was by all accounts the kind of man this country was built on . You are free to leave the city . I won 't even try to make you stay . The piano 's yours regardless . They really need me back home . But I was thinking I might stay . Feels like the braver thing . It 's what Eli would 've done . She likes him . You like him too . Happiness really suits her . It 's embarrassing . I am still a bit in awe of you after all these years . All you 've accomplished . Still accomplishing . I 'll let you work . Be right back .

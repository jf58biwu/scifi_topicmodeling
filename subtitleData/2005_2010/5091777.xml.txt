 NARRATOR : Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : SARAH : Kaliba was building something . WEAVER : John Henry was infiltrated . MURCH : Someone out there wants to kill him . - Who 's John Henry ? He 's my friend . Savannah 's survival may someday depend upon John Henry . What were you doing at the house ? Why 'd you take the girl ? Protect her . Girl 's in danger . When we jumped , you told me I died of cancer . - She 's lost weight . - What ? Let me talk to Weaver . I 'll meet with Connor . Make it happen . MAN [ OVER PA ] : Put your hands behind your head . Kneel on the ground . [ DOOR OPENS ] I know you 've been told this but as I am a " measure twice , cut once " kind of carpenter I wanna reiterate that you have the right to an attorney if you are so inclined , and if you are not anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . Not inclined . Fair enough and noted . Here 's where we come down on all this . Ten years ago , you murdered one Miles Dyson employee of Cyberdyne . Long time gone , but the man 's still dead , so we 've got that . Eight years ago , you and your son and a high school friend of his blow up a bank vault and die in the explosion . Now , of course , you 're still alive , which is inconvenient for many but the bank 's still blown , so we 've got that . More recently , and by that I mean Monday you participated in a firefight , leaving five dead and kidnapping one Savannah Weaver daughter of Catherine Weaver and citizen of Scotland making this an incident both federal and international . Two of the dead were law-enforcement officers and that usually gets you the needle , but in that I do digress . - Agent Aldridge ? - Yeah ? You 're a funny boy . That 's what Mom says . I never liked funny boys . I doubt they like you either , Ms. Connor . There 's two ways I can bring your son into custody : with your help or dead . - Which do you think it should be ? - My son ? Your son . John Connor . - John is dead . - I don 't think so . He died in the bank . Oh , I don 't think so . I don 't think anyone died in the bank . - Well , you 're wrong . - Sometimes , but not today . Not yet . Think about it . WOMAN [ ON TV ] : She was arrested and is now in custody facing a series of new charges as well as a host of old ones . Authorities are also on the lookout for Connor 's son as well as a female accomplice . Here are photos dating back eight years . Both fugitives would now be in their mid - ' 20s . - We should move . - This motel is out of the way . The desk clerk could have clocked us . Relocating within 24 hours of the incident has high risk factors . This room provides sightlines down the highway . This is not an incident . This is my mother . I need a computer . I need to do research . You want the blueprints for the Los Angeles Jail . Do I ? So you can plan how to get your mother out . I 'm not going to let you . You should know that . - I do know that by now . - Then what is there to research ? Power sources . Shielded nuclear-power sources . - Like mine ? - Just like yours . Why ? I wanna know if being around them all the time can give you cancer . [ WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV ] MAN [ ON TV ] : Also in the news , authorities have arrested Sarah Connor a known domestic terrorist . She 's seen here being escorted to- - Okay , it 's a large room it 's dark , it 's quiet , it 's impossible to see . - You may wanna roll a scan . - I 'll roll a scan . - I rolled a one . - One . Oh , okay . Tough luck . You don 't see the umber hulk as it crawls from its nest in the stone and attacks you . You take three hit points of damage from a bite to the shoulder . I attack the umber hulk . Twenty . Wow . Okay , that 's a crit with the vorpal longsword to the umber hulk . Unbelievable . Lucky roll . Hello , Ms. Weaver . I just delivered a crit hit to the umber hulk . Congratulations . Mr. Murch ? Who 's winning , Mr. Murch ? MURCH : Oh , it 's not really that kind of game . But I 'm a little bummed that he killed the umber hulk so fast . You 've considered he can roll whatever number he desires ? Mr. Murch how long will it take to disassemble everything for transport ? Uh , everything ? You mean , like , everything ? Is that something you 're planning on doing ? No . But John Henry 's been attacked once . We should be prepared . John Henry was hacked . And we fixed that . Besides , I think we 're past the point where moving the hardware 's a good idea . In fact , I think it 's potentially a really bad idea . Oh ? How 's that so ? For example the other day , one of the fan wires on a server was glitchy . So we switched it out . Same wire . Same length . Identical . Like , uh , changing a spark plug . - And ... ? - Sort of tweaked him . WEAVER : I 'm not sure what you 're getting at . What I 'm getting at is I think what we know to be John Henry only exists as this specific collection of hardware and software . Body and soul . We change a wire , we change John Henry . Yes . Mr. Murch ? I 'm ready to confront the mind flayer now . Twenty . They followed me to the movie theater . I didn 't know . I swear . I spent the last four hours convincing them we weren 't in this together . Maybe I should tell them we were . Maybe we were in this together . - I just wanted the girl to be safe . - So did I. - From whom ? - I don 't know . Don 't know or you can 't say ? I don 't know . If I did , I probably couldn 't say . They wanna know what you 've been doing for 10 years . What did you tell them ? I told them I have no idea what you 've been doing . What else could I tell them ? You could tell them . Tell them everything you 've been doing . You could draw them a picture of everything they know and everything you know . If you 're innocent , you could do that . The last time I drew a picture I ended up in a psych ward . Maybe things would be different now . Maybe you got nothing to lose . There 's always something to lose . I am sorry for this . Yeah , sure you are . Where 's the girl ? Back with her mother . Where else would a child be ? She 's not safe . She 's not safe . She 's not safe . Agent ? Mr. Ellison , come in . It 's open . This is where they stick us now . Pretty sure I know what the subtext is , but I refuse to read that deep . - She 's not budging on the son . - Maybe she 's telling the truth . Maybe she 's a liar lacking the proper motivation to tell the truth . But she 's got a guilty conscience . - What makes you think that ? - Well for starters , she 's requested a priest . - What ? - Yep . A man of the cloth in the flesh . Black and white and God all over . - Father Armando Bonilla ring a bell ? - No . Can 't imagine what the connection is . It ever occur to you she just might wanna pray ? Not for a second . Other than a lawyer , a priest is the only other person she could ask to speak with that we can 't listen to . [ DOOR OPENS ] Buenos dias , Father . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] Do you remember me ? You and your son hid in my church . There was a problem with your daughter . At least that is what you told me . Yeah . She 's better now . Where is she ? She 's in hiding . With my son . I don 't know where . And they are wanted ? You have included them in your crimes . Do you believe in the devil , Father ? The devil ? Do you believe in the actual devil ? Something opposes God . Something tempts man into sin . I don 't know about God or heaven . But I do believe that someone or something wants this world to burn . The devil . Demons . I believe . And that day in the church ? My daughter ? You saw things , didn 't you ? I pray every day to understand what happened that day . I can explain it to you . I don 't know if you 'll believe me , but I can explain it to you . And after I 'm done , I 'm gonna ask you to do something for me . Will you do something for me ? WEAVER : Mr. Ellison . Welcome back . How are your friends in law enforcement ? How are your friends in law enforcement , Mr. Ellison ? Very determined . What is this ? WEAVER : Sarah Connor is talking with a priest . Father Armando Bonilla . I can see that . Why is it here ? Why are you watching it ? WEAVER : John Henry monitors all law-enforcement channels . It seems prudent . It seems illegal . So is lying to the FBI . Don 't think now is the time to be parsing which laws we 'll obey . - And which we will not . - Now 's not the time . I heard it when she said it . - Those cameras should be off . - I want to meet him . The priest ? No . The boy . You wanna meet John Connor ? Someone 's attacked my family . They may attack again . I think he knows something . And besides , he saved my daughter . - And I want to thank him . - Thank you . Can we talk outside ? It 's a bad idea . I don 't know what you think John knows . I know he was at my house when the attacker showed up . I want to know why . His mother thinks he 's the messiah . I want to know why . And despite your reluctance to tell me I surmise that he and his cyborg companion are connected to the John Henry body . And I want to know why . Yes , she 's a cyborg . Don 't pretend you didn 't know . She 's dangerous . And you think I need protecting . That 's sweet . But don 't ever lie to me again . Now , about John Connor ... . I don 't know how to find him . Well , I do . Twenty . - Can I help you ? - Yes . How ? - Ammo ? - Silencers . You know we can 't sell that kind of stuff . Ask to speak to Manny . I want to speak to Manny . Call the number first . Then ask . You know , I always thought the best thing about those guns was the sound . No , it 's not . How much weight has she lost ? You think she has cancer because she 's lost weight . How much has she lost ? Eleven percent of her mass in the last six weeks . She was healthy before you showed up . That 's all I know . She was healthy . If my power source was leaking radiation , I would know . I have sensors for that . - Where are they ? - You can 't see them . Of course not . I just have to trust you on it . But stuff does go wrong with you , doesn 't it ? Stuff breaks . You kill birds , you twitch . You try to murder me . You 're not perfect . You 're a machine . [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] Mom ? Uh , yes , I remember you . Buenos días to you too , Father . [ DOOR CREAKS ] Underneath the bench there is an envelope . I hope it is enough . It 's all I could find . I have a message for you as well . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] What 's wrong ? The IDs are flawless . They 're flawless . There 's nothing else there . There 's nothing hidden there . No secret message there for her escape . I am to tell you this from your mother : Leave this place . As soon as it is safe leave this place . Do not think of her . Do not come for her . Leave . You are to make sure that he does . We lose everybody we love . She said that ? No . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] That 's interesting . [ GUN COCKS ] Let me repeat , I had nothing to do with your mother 's arrest . If I had , there 'd be a SWAT team outside your door right now . Same thing would happen to this SWAT team as happened to your last one . Catherine Weaver would like to meet you . Why ? She wants to thank you for saving Savannah . Well , she just did . Your mother wanted to meet her . Well , when my mother gets out , trust me , she will . I told Miss Weaver you 'd never come without your mom . She said if that was the case , I 'm supposed to ask one question . She says I 'm supposed to ask you : " Will you join us ? " She says she hopes you 'll know what that means . Do you know what that means ? No , I don 't . Please leave now , Mr. Ellison . I think you 've said enough . - John-- - You 've said enough , Mr. Ellison . I won 't ask you again . He upset you . Me ? I think he upset you . You know that 's impossible . Is it ? You said it yourself , John . I 'm just a machine . I believe you . You believe me what ? I believe there are machines . I believe they 've come back from the future to first kill you and then your son . I believe in time travel , I believe in cyborgs . I believe there 's a world that I 've not yet seen but you have , and John . In the last eight hours , I 've received 37 calls from people who have met a young man named John Baum or his sister Cameron , or Sarah Baum , the mother . They now know her to be Sarah Connor . By all accounts your son looks 16 and not 24 just as you look 35 and not 43 . I believe you have participated in the miraculous and the terrible and through it all , you have maintained a moral and good soul . I want to help you . I wanna help your son . Help me do that . My son is dead . - Do you know who Danny Dyson is ? - Danny ? Miles Dyson 's son . Do you know where he is ? No . Why ? He 's been missing three months . Hey . You the guy who smashed through my gate ? Yes . Hey . I liked that gate . Catherine Weaver ? Sure . [ WOUNDS SLITHERING ] The chip has been treated with a phosphorus compound . - When exposed to oxygen- - - It burns up . I know what happened . I saw it happen . Can any data be recovered ? I can try , but it 's highly doubtful . We need to know what it knows . Who sent it ? It is safe to assume my brother sent it . Mr. Ellison , where have you been ? Where have I been ? It 's 7 in the morning . I 've been asleep . - Didn 't you get my message ? - It was very disappointing . Did you give the message exactly as I said it ? Of course . Look , I told you before she 'll never leave his side , and he 'll never leave his mother 's . [ IN UNISON ] We 'll see . Don 't do that . My mom used to do that . I really hate that . What 's going on ? You need to understand how it works . - What ? - This chip . This body . The software is designed to terminate humans . The hardware is designed to terminate humans . That 's our sole function . - Not you . - No . Not anymore . But what was there is still there . It 'll always be there . So down deep you wanna kill me . Yes . I do . Then why don 't you ? I might some day . I need to show you something . This body . Get on top of me . Put your knee here . Right here . If I 'm damaged , we should know . Reach down under the breastplate . There . What does it feel like ? Cold . That 's good , right ? That 's good . That 's perfect . John . It 's time to go . [ PHONE RINGING ] CAMERON [ OVER PHONE ] : Buenos dias , Father Bonilla . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] It 's okay . GUARD : Door . [ LOCK CLICKS ] You did what I asked ? I did . And ? Why are you here ? They have a message for you . She 's coming . [ ALARM WAILING ] I don 't know what to do . You 're a priest . Pray . [ GUN COCKS ] [ MURMURING INDISTINCTLY ] What 's that Bible story ? The one where the locks fall off ? - Peter . - Yeah . That 's a good one . Gird thyself . [ MEN CHATTERING ] [ SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] INMATE : Go , go , go ! [ SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] [ SCREAMS ] There 's been a bit of an incident . At the jail ? JOHN HENRY : Yes . - Any idea how it started ? - Yes . Look there . And there . You look like hell . Can you keep up ? [ MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA ] I sent you a message . I told you- - Yeah , bad John Connor . Ground me . Are you okay ? I 'm not 100 percent . How far from 100 percent are you ? Why ? I need to meet Catherine Weaver . And she needs to destroy whatever 's in that basement . God , I really wish we weren 't here right now . Savannah could tell them we know about Cromartie . John Henry now . Metal . If she tells them , they 'll move it . Maybe they already have . Well , we 'll know soon enough . Mom , are you sick ? Cameron thinks you 're sick . She does ? You 've lost weight . [ ELEVATOR DINGS ] I love you . Where 's Cameron ? In the car . Expecting trouble ? No change for the meter . You 're not armed , are you ? Expecting trouble ? No reason for that . No reason at all . [ GRUNTING ] Hello . Hello . I know you . And I know you . Will you join us ? So . Why are we here ? - We need- - - Let me restate . We are here , first and foremost , so that I can thank you for your heroism regarding my daughter Savannah . She 's the light of my life , and I 'd be lost without her . And where is she ? Let 's assume school . We have a common enemy . One we cannot fight with conventional weapons or means . Kaliba ? Don 't presume to know Kaliba . I 'm sorry , I wasn 't speaking to you . I was speaking to you . About Skynet . Savannah 's told you about John Henry , I assume ? Which is why your cyborg is skulking around my basement . What the hell ? Get down . Run . WEAVER : The basement . Mr. Ellison . - John Henry . - We need to get out . They 're trying to kill my son . No , they 're trying to kill my son . Just like you are . - I 'm sure she 's done it . - You better hope not . Your John may save the world , but he can 't do it without mine . Her chip , it 's gone . Well , where is he ? The- - John Henry ? He took her chip . Where did he go ? WEAVER : He didn 't take the chip . - She gave it to him . - John . Where is he ? Not where . When . What ? What do you mean , when ? I know that . I 've seen it before . Is that the Turk ? That 's Andy Goode 's Turk . Three dots . You lying Terminator bitch . You 're building Skynet . No . I was building something to fight it . And I 'd watch who 's calling who a bitch . - Coming , James ? - Coming ? After John Henry . - Our boy . - He 's not my boy . - And you , you- - - Mind picking up Savannah , then ? Gymnastics ends at 5 : 30 . [ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ] John , we can 't . He 's got her chip . He 's got her . Mom . I 'll stop it . Where 's Cameron ? - Where 's her body ? - It doesn 't go through . [ DOGS BARKING ] [ MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] Got one . - Got one . - One what ? What ? - Please , I 'm not metal . - Don 't move . Don 't move . I swear I haven 't got anything . I 'm- - I 'm human . - Because I will blast you . MAN : Stand down . Look in his eyes . He 's got about as much metal in him as you do . Derek ? Yeah ? John . John Connor . I know a lot of people , kid . I don 't know you . Anybody heard the name John Connor ? Well , you know what ? I think you 're gonna be famous . My brother 's back , and you 're wearing his coat . SARAH : I love you too . [ ENGLISH SDH ]

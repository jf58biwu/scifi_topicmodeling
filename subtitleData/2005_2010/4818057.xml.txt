Coming through ! Pardon me . You moron ! Please let me through ... Idiot . Why waste your time wading through a traffic jam ? So he should run on the wall like you or something ? That 's it ! How is it ? It 's good ! What ? It 's the new business venture I 've come up for you . Don 't yank my chain ! What 's the big idea dragging them into it too ? What 's wrong with that ? right ? Yup ! Like old times ! remember ? But I never expected this ! but after Dan was arrested last year Miyuki came home all grown up ! okay ? what do you plan to do with this ? A delivery service . Door-to-door ! Door-to-door delivery ... You mean me ? ! Right ! You can test his legs by running all over town . It 'll also serve as advertisement for our maintenance service and earn money . Three birds with one stone ! but I 've got no reason to play along . don 't you ? no matter what . the one who stands out the most wins . All right then ! Oh nice ! I can run as much as I have to with this ! Hey ! Deliver something for me ! sir ! Hear that ? Our first customer ! R-Right ! Any destination is just a leap away for Dunk Mask 's Dangan Delivery !

You 're just your big tits ! Dan . others can 't . I think you can run through town just fine if we plan out some routes . son ? I know everything from Town Hall down to the doghouses . I want to be an architect when I grow up . So that just leaves the Bigfoot ... We can whip something up . I 've had enough of this . You . Don 't you want to heal Coco 's legs ? Hey ! How 's it going ? It sucks ! you jerk ? I heard " delivery service " and remembered these . Thought I 'd hire you for a delivery myself . What are those ? Are these ... sandals ? Yeah ! I cut them from old tires . They 're my greatest invention ! And they sell like hotcakes at construction sites ! I got another order so I thought I 'd have you deliver them . This is it ! correct ?

What manufacturer are you from ? didn 't you ? N-No ! Don 't try to hide it . I can tell by looking at you . You just got here ? You 're shaky on your feet in this gravity . Why don 't you quit sneaking around over here and take pictures in full daylight up close ? Huh ? Technology thrives best when it 's being shared . technique is a personal thing . That you can 't steal so easily . Th-Thank you very much ! My company is lagging behind and this will — { barfing sounds } your food is likely to come back up . You 're gravity-sick . { sz : like the opposite of being spacesick I guess } Is that okay ? aren 't they stealing from you ? my family is like that . That 's why Gramps and Dad both came down from there . 900 ) } Dad ! And that 's why I won 't let it beat me either . Not ever . Excellent ! I 'm gonna conquer the world with this thing ! And then straight on to the moon ! Coco ! we 've been hearing people talking about him all the time . right now he really is working hard . How does it feel to make a legend into your personal carrier boy ? Does it make you feel superior ? In a sadistic way ? I don 't have to answer that . Don 't take me wrong . it doesn 't matter . One of these days I 'll get my chance to have my fill of him . I 'm afraid . I thought you were the one who hates me . men like women with technique . I hope that technique works out for you . Exactly . I 'll clip his wings for you . { lol so many notes . This phrase is literally " debone " or " water down " ( or " emasculate " ) and it means to remove the most essential part of something . Alt tl is maybe " I 'll take the wind out of his sails for you " but I don 't think that 's strong enough . } Bel . What ? The side mirror 's cracked . that 's so you can look at the Bigfoot 's feet . Miyuki comes up with some pretty neat stuff . Yes . but you 'd still like to be placed on it ? that 's right . of course . { continues unintelligibly } And everyone and their brother wants to copy us . What 's wrong with that ? It 's great when things become easier to use for everyone . sure . But you know what ? Only I can do this ! You 're the only idiot who would ! This is the pace of a legend ! What the ? ! Smart-ass ! He 's better than you are . Shut up ! you ! Hey ! What about the delivery ? I can 't let this go ! Why ? Because he copied your business plan ? No ! Those feet and sandals ... Do Miyuki and Ganz take orders from any jerk who 's a customer ? ! Jealous ? Shut up ! hey . Look at that . It 's Dunk Mask . What 's he doing ? The other one ... That 's Platina 's Hurricane ! Dammit ! A ... A woman ? Sela Miranda ! Sela Miranda ! huh ? Okay then ! Hey Dunk Mask ! Use that ! Right ! but could you deliver this ? You won 't beat my running and you won 't beat my dribbling !

Higher ! Shit ! That woman ! losing to a girl ... you don 't get it . that has nothing to with it . What ? As Crawly said . Being a man or a woman is beside the point . it 's the person 's skills that makes the difference . yes . You ! With the flowers ! I 'm happy you remember me . My name is Sela D. Miranda . but didn 't pan out . I 'm pretty disappointed . What ? ! Did you slip a bit in prison ? Dunk Mask was different . my heart started to pound ; it truly did . I thought " He 's it . He 's the one ! But that was nipped in the bud . you were already over . You know what a legend is ? It 's a story that has ended . It doesn 't have any future . Dunk Mask . I 've got no more reason to bother with you . O-Over ? No more reason ? Wait a second ! What are they ? Shells ? { alt tl : Bombs ? } it 's different ! A ball ? Wait ... Dunk Mask ? What are you gonna do ? stupid-head ? ! { lit : stupid dumpling } you 'd get even stupider ! Shut up !

Who is this guy and why was- - Why was he being chased by those- - I don 't know what they are , but they 're after me now . Uh , he was just a drunk who used to come here and talk lots of crazy talk . If he 's got himself into some kind of trouble , that 's got nothing to do with me . I have to go . I can 't let them see me with you . Why did he want me to find you ? He must 've had a reason ? He got away . Yes . I didn 't believe him . I didn 't believe . Go out through the back . Uh , please , help me get outta here ! Get up and walk . H-how can I get up ? How can I walk ? How long have I been here ? You know you are Six . Please , I 'm nobody . I don 't know anything , please ! But you do ... You are Six ... You are village ... The truth is right inside you , Six . Look-look ! It 's you . And I thought you just wanted to dance with me . H-how long have I been here ? Well , you 've been sleeping a while . I thought I was dyin ' . Help me . What 's happening to me ? I wish you didn 't fight it . Fight what ? Please , let me help you . I don 't want your help , lady , I want to get the hell outta here . Look , here 's what 's gonna happen- - I 'm gonna fetch you a cold drink and then , someone is gonna take you home . You 're a free man . I 'd like to speak to the American consul , please . Look , see how the sun makes it all glow ? Kind of day that makes you glad to be alive . Why are you keepin ' me here ? I see no locked doors . Well , they were after me . Ooo , sounds terribly ominous . Why am I here ? It has nothing to do with me , any of this . I 've seen you before . Really ? What were you doing in the mountains , Six ? I was-I was , uh , lost . I mean , I have no idea how I got here . I .. What did you call me ? This .. Look , something 's wrong here . Yes ! You are wrong , Six . Do not call me that , I am not Six . Show me your ID papers . Well , I don 't have any papers ... Well , you just put them there . You were seen in the mountains . what have you done with 93 ? I don 't know anything about 93 . Where is the old man ? You can 't do this to me ! I don 't care who you are- - do you hear me ! Now , I wanna get back to New York . Well , that 's not possible . There is no New York- - there 's only the village . Look , we 've been here before . It all feels too familiar , I know that . Truly , we live for today . This is my home ? We must be doing something right . No , I mean ... You can 't escape it . My apartment .. .. done in your other life . Wonkers , this is where you belong . We interrupt this programming for the following public .. Will you just , uh , sign this to say that everything 's in order ? I 'm signin nothin ' , pal . The palais today identified the missing villager as 93 , a man in his late 70 's , last seen heading north into the desert two nights ago . 93 is well known to hospital staff following a history of stage seven mental unwellness . He also suffers from shortness of breath , dizzy spells and a weak heart , but we wish him well and hope to report his discovery imminently ... if not sooner . Hey ! What can I do you for ? I 'd like to buy a map . Hmm ... street or topographic ? Biggest one you got . That 's the biggest ? Pull her out . That 's it ! Buy one , get one free . What the hell would I want with two maps ? Makes a perfect gift . Big enough for ya ? Here we are ... You are here . That 's the palais two . " Wow " being the appropriate word . and that 's the clinic and- - Where 's the road outta here ? Ohh , you crack me up , Six . You 've not seen me before . No , sir . You , I would remember . But you know my .. - Welcome to the village . Everybody knows everybody ! Be seein ' ya ! Six ! Six , wait ! Why are you calling me that ? Well , I think that it suits you . Six ... hmm , I like it . Six , where do you think you 're going ? Goin ' home . You won 't get far . Is there nothing can say that will make you wait ? You can tell me the truth . What the hell is this place ? You 're one of us . That 's the truth . Wha , hey ! Aw , man , not my car- - come on ! Do you think I could use your phone ? Mine 's just been stolen . Yeah . Go ahead . Actually , I lied . I lost it . I 'm always losing my phone . I hate leaving messages , don 't you ? I noticed you , 'cause you look like you 're waiting for someone . Maybe , I am . Who you waitin ' for ? Don 't answer that . I 'm late ... again . ... traffic the same on the G.W. as the Jersey turnpike . It 's hell on four wheels out there . So , if you want my advice- - get off your butt and walk ! Total gridlock from some kind of gas explosion in the heart of Brooklyn . Hey ! You got my phone . Oh ! Um , I 'd say , " sorry " but I promised myself I 'd stop apologizing to men . Having a party ? Yeah , you wanna come ? Ah ... Can 't make it tonight . Oh ... There 's no party , anyway . Ah , just what I thought ... " drinking alone . " I 'm celebrating . Oh , yeah , what ? Ah ... You were talking to someone . You shouldn 't listen to other people 's conversations . It 's rude . How come you 're interested in my life back there , if it doesn 't exist ? Of course , I 'm interested . I want to help you with these delusions . I can 't leave here , can I ? Why would you want to leave ? Why would you even think such a thing ? All right , doctor . My delusion is , I met a woman the other night ... And I invited her back to my apartment . Did she come back ... To your apartment ? I don 't know . I don 't know . What 's that ? I haven 't opened it , yet . It 's from the clinic . What 's it say ? We 've been summoned , to the clinic . What for ? An appointment , with Two . Oh , dear ! It says someone else here at the bottom . So , this guy at the hospital , he wants to know where 93 's body is . Why ? That 's not a delusion . That 's happening here , right now . If you did see 93 . Is that why they set me free , to let you loose on me ? The caring , sharing doctor , With the big beautiful eyes and the nice , girly smile . Soften me up , get me to talk ? Of course , you doubt me . You doubt everything , but that 's not you speaking , Six . That 's your condition . My condition is that I 'm being held here against my will . Cabins 29 to 63 . Yellow district- - cabins 309 to 357 . Green district , apartments 51 to 299 . Can you see , Six , how I might wonder why you are here , if , as you claim , " you know nothing about 93 ? " I came here to find out who this man , 93 , is . Now that you 're here ... Do you see what he was ? A drunk . A fool . Maybe he drank , Because he found the lie of this place unbearable . He knew what I know . The village is not all that there is . What is it you 're suggesting ? A hole in the sky , Aliens landing secretly in the night , Mysterious roads that lead beyond , beyond , beyond . A magic gateway , perhaps ? Some portal leading into " never-never land . " Take a look outside , Six . People going about their lives , Strolling in the sun , sitting together in the park , or anywhere where they might choose to sit together . They take a scooter ride , go dancing , enjoy a beer in the cafe , while they gaze about the village , contented , hopeful . Every day above ground is a good day . The problem ... is in your mind . Well ... I want out . You 've tried that ! There is no " out . " There is only " in . " Now , you can go on tormenting yourself , if that 's what you want , or you can stop . If 93 were no more than a drunk , a fool , as you say , then why were they chasing after him , shooting at him ? Because 93 found something , and if he can do it , I can . I pity you , Six . You refuse to open your mind to the possibility that you 're wrong . If I open my mind , you 'll take it away from me . We might ... but we will always give it back . Did 93 show you this- - I need to know . Did he talk to you about this ? Are there other drawings ? 554 , please . 93 must 've trusted you . There has to be a reason he told me to come to you . What is this ? What does this do ? I 'm going to meet my boyfriend . I 'm sorry . Please , help me . Please . 93 said , " the drawings were from his other life ... " before the village . " That 's all I know . You have to leave me alone , now . And you are here to receive a medal for services to the village , and you should keep the medal with you , at all times . And when you met number Six , what did you make of him ? He was a little strange . A-a-actuall .. nope . Number Six has been dealt with , so he is no longer a worry to us . And there was another thing , in the summons . Uh , yeah , it said , uh , " to bring cake , with cherries in it . " Did you ? Uh , yeah , yeah . Oh , no- - leave it there . My dear villagers , perhaps Two could interrupt your day in the sun to relate the grave news that we have discovered number 93 's body in the mountains . Sadly , the old man had succumbed to a weak heart . He spoke briefly to emergency staff , before dying on route to the hospital . His last words were to honor the village , and request the anthem be sung in his name . If you tell me what you know , I promise you , I won 't come back . Breathe in , breath out ... village life goes on . Do you want , uh , something to drink ? 93 was convinced that his dreams meant that he had another life , before this one . He started saying things , " that we 're prisoners here . " Prisoners ? I 've said too much . I-I don 't even know who you are . It 's okay , you can trust me . I am not one of them . I dream this , all the time . What is it ? This is more real , than anything out there . This is the first bit of hope I 've been given , since I got here . If there are others like us , who dream , and they got to thinking that 93 escaped , then , do you think there are others ? Do you ? Are you for real ? I promise you , you 're safe with me . I 'll see you at the cafe tomorrow . What is it , 11-12 ? Why is Six so convinced there is another place ? Because for people like Six , life is not enough . The simple life ... They want to escape it . What are you doing here ? Oh , I 'm trying to find out what you 're doin ' here . Do something for me , will ya ? Lie down beside me . Uh , you 're supposed to be trying to convince me you 're sane . Come on . Uh , okay . Right . A hundred billion stars , over and over billions of galaxies , and that 's just what we can see . Can you honestly tell me that the village is all that there is ? Of course not . Has to be life out there somewhere . Perhaps , another village . Oh , it 's , um , 400 billion , by the way . Look at me . Isaac Newton , Galileo , Plato , Socrates , Karl Marx , Groucho Marx , Darwin , surely , Darwin . Kennedy , Bob Dylan , David Beckam . Who invented the telephone ? Oh , uh , uh ... Alexander Graham Bell , the light bulb ? 512 . Everyone says it was Thomas Edison . It was Joseph Swan . Where do these names come from , these memories ? I was taught this stuff by a lady named Mrs. Radcliff , My teacher . Now , where does that come from ? Now , tell me about Mrs. Radcliff . You 're humoring me . Tell me , anyway . Okay , she had a big blue nose , skin like a crocodile . She actually looked more like a man in a dress . Not just a man , but a boxer . Wow ! I like her , already . Do you know what a crocodile is ? Are you trying to trap me ? Yes , no . Yes . Yes ... yes . are you trying to trap me ? No . Tell me about the woman . I resigned today . Oh , that 's why you 're celebrating . Alone . Too bad . Um , I go this way . Oh ! Really ? Really . Uh , what 's your name ? Lucy . Lucy . Well , I 'd like to get to know you , Lucy . Well , maybe you can . Well , I 'd like to get to know you , tonight . Well , maybe you can . Maybe , you can . * Take your burden to the lord and leave it there * * If you trust and never doubt * * It will surely bring you out * * Take your burden to the lord and leave it there * What 's goin ' on ? You know what it is , Six . 93 deserves a decent burial . You didn 't find his body . 93 is gone- - escaped . Found the way out . If 93 found the way out , Six can convince himself that there is an out . Six must try to escape , because Six knows , there is nothing to escape from . In his mind , in is soul , Six knows that Six is Six . Hey , man , need a cab ? Why would I need a cab , if I 'm going into a cafe ? Well , you know , people who go into cafes , come outta cafes , and sometimes , they might need a cab . Well , I don 't know , if I 'll need a cab . Why you hassling me , anyway ? - Hey , Six ... I like ya , you 're a likable man . And I like giving rides in my cab to people I like . Sometimes , being nice is , uh , well , it 's just being nice . Hey . I 'll always be here , if you need me . Thanks . If you 're crawling through traffic , hoping to escape for the weekend , think hard , my friends . Did you hear that ? It 's the same on the G.W.- - It 's hell on four wheels out there . Oh , gridlock , after some kind of gas explosion , in the heart of Brooklyn . Put a pillow on his face , snuffed him out like a ... Snuffed him out like a candle . Now-now , he 's dead . Need some help here ! Hey . I 'm glad I met you , Six . I 'm glad I told you . Perhaps , we can escape together . When you 're better . 93 said , he said ... " Follow the towers . " Please , back away , sir- - please , back away . Keep calm , now . What is it , terrorists ? Some kind of resistance ? Tell me . You should 've stayed away from her . So , what are you saying ? Are you saying , " this is my fault ? " Look .. - No , you tell me , damn it ! What 's the matter with you ? - Don 't you see ? With every pore of my body , I 'm scared . Look , um ... sometimes , not very often , something like this happens , and everything goes back to normal . Things , they settle down . They do it for us . Just , please , don 't make things worse , Six . " I promise you , you 're safe with me . " Two ! Do you hear me ? She 's gone- - you did that . She knew there was a way outta here and I 'm gonna find it ! I will find a way to escape ! Do you hear me ? I am not a number ! I 'm a free man !

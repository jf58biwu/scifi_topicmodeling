The wind decides victory and defeat . It 's in the air ... isn 't it ? Yes ! The excitement of the people waiting for the festival to begin has spread throughout the whole town . Whoops ! That 's some wind ! The main industry in this town is the generation of wind power . it results in an incredible force being unleashed . The hubbub of city life on the wind ... The scent of the water ... it don 't smell half bad . It 's not Turpentine City . It 's Turbine City ; the city of wind . But is it really all right for us to have a match in a town that 's so densely built ? It 'll be fine . since they 're all built to withstand hurricanes . I dunno . Some of ' em look pretty beat already . It 's an old town . Miss Sela ? it 's all new to me . Miss Sela ? I 'm gonna check things out over there . Miss Haruka will scold you if you skip the scouting ! I 'll make sure to look around ! Miss Sela ! just let her go . Maybe she 's hungry . Don 't lump her with yourself ! What ? ! Stupid-head ! dingbat ! What ? ! you overgrown pet ? ! Sela 's Road " ? Hey ! What are ya doing ? Let 's go ! Okay ! Look ! It 's Dunk Mask ! So it is ! It 's Dan JD ! There 's Iceman Hotty ! Hey ! What the heck ? ! It 's him ! What 's wrong ? it 's nothing . we can really get excited ! He said it ! It wouldn 't be Basquash without you guys ! D-Damn right it wouldn 't ! Can you write your name here ? I 'm collecting everyone 's autograph ! Your wish is my command . hurry up ! I beg your pardon . and I guess he was right ! Huh ? Mr. Iceman ? What ? Did the iceberg wander off by himself somewhere too ? You guys are falling apart . Really ! please . there are some pretty nice machines around here . Ganz ! Yeah ? What 's next ? Take a look at this . This town 's really interesting . there 's " Sela 's " all over the place ! what do ya know . Sela ? Mom ... So this is where you are . I didn 't expect you to show your face at the house after all this time . Master . Seems like you 've been doing well lately . Make this one for the history books . I don 't care if you knock the town down around you . You sure ? It 's an old town . We 've got insurance . I doubt anyone will complain . there 's some pretty big bets riding on your team . How many times must you crush something precious to me before you 're satisfied ? You resemble her now . You have no right to talk about Mom ! Do you have any idea what Mom went through after the family drove her out ? ! How much pain she died in ? ! All because I 'm a female so I can 't inherit ! No other reason ! Stop right there ! Our conversation isn 't over - I 'm looking forward to seeing you . Mr. Falcon ! please leave . You will be a distraction to our guests . Don 't say that ! Just one photo ! C 'mon ! Give us an interview with Falcon ! Please ! What a ruckus . though . Mind if I borrow that ? What ? Yes ? Mr. Falcon . I see . A message was delivered with it . Iceman ! I wonder where Miss Sela and Mr. Iceman went ? Who ... knows ? ! Mr. Dan ! Don 't call me Mr. Dan ! we 're not here to play around ! There 's a flutter in the wind ... So fast ! And precise ... This is the sound of dribbling ! Hey ! I hear Team Bigbear arrived ! Starfire too ! Let 's go see ! ready to play on a whole new level from anyone we 've faced so far ... I 've got to keep that in mind . I 'm sleepy . I 'm starving . Ow ! I 'm surprised you managed to get in here . that wasn 't difficult . I said I 'd trade him one of your secrets . I know something you don 't ! You bastard ! What did you tell him ? Does it matter ? we won 't have the opportunity to talk like this . Do you want me to congratulate you for making it to the championships ? Or are you here to rant about your grudge ? It 's true that I hated you . There 's no counting how many times I 've killed you in my dreams . Maybe it 's better to get shoes specially made for these conditions after all ... We can just leave that stuff to the boobs . look properly ! You 're looking too hard ! Those players are big ! They look strong ! Being big doesn 't make you good . I wanna eat something big ! and its strength ... I think that will have a huge effect on how we play . Silly Mr. Dan ... I 've got to be the responsible one here ... What 's that over there ? I can hear it . The murmur and roar of many people . The town 's tension and expectations before the festival ... I 'm sure this is where the opening ceremonies are going to be held . with a fifth lap of one minute and forty-five seconds ! Sweet ! A new world record ! Mr. Dan ! Do you know what you 're doing ? ! Incredible players have gathered here from all over the world ! They 're a level up from the teams you 've played so far ! We 've got to investigate as much as we can ! Mr. Dan - That hurt ! Dammit ! No kidding ! Dunk Mask ! Idol Red ! It 's Rouge . You gonna sing at the opening ceremonies ? sounds just like something a pop idol would do . I am an idol . And I 'm in the middle of rehearsals right now ! three hearses tall " ? will ya ? Rehearsals ! You can watch if you want . I 'll let you in as a special favor . No thanks . Do you know how much one of my fans would pay for that chance ? ! I 'm not one of your fans ! I am ! I 'm an Eclipse fan ! But the gauntlet has already been thrown down . you and Miss Rouge should stop getting along so well with each other . When did I ever get along with Red ? ! What 's gotten into him ? Who knows ? He 's been acting weird all day . The gauntlet has been thrown down . that 's right ! Did you hear about the prize ? I couldn 't care less . Really ? I reckon it 's something that would psych you up . Rouge ? Rouge ? Thought so ! or I 'll never hear the end of it ! Dunk Mask . Idol Red ! Rouge ! Where were you ? The break ended several - I got lost . is it ? You 've still got an attachment to a player who was dropped ? Why don 't I let you see it too ? What a legend is . I 've yet to see him as anything other than a wild monkey . I see . Then perhaps I should 've made the first prize a mountain of bananas . I 'm sure . Good ! Every last one of ' em is perfect ! Miyuki ! Come here ! There 's been an announcement ! What ? What ? Hey ! Let 's finish up and head back already ! stupid-head ! Feel free . anyway ? I 'm not angry . Yes you are ! I 'm not angry . I 'm fed up . Huh ? Fed up ? I 'm fed up . Mr. Dan . Mr. Iceman and Miss Sela too ... You 're all scattered everywhere ! It doesn 't matter . I 'll scout out the whole town even if I have to do it by myself ! the wind hasn 't started blowing yet . The wind ? You said it yourself . Many winds are gathered into one ! You 're not heading back ? I don 't remember how Mom looked when she smiled . I can only remember her crying . Mommy ! Mommy ! Sela . Tell me ! Why did Mommy have to die ? ! Answer me ! So ? Are you serious about killing me this time ? I never became a legend . And so I hated you enough to want to kill you . I repeat : the OCB Commission revealed that the first prize in the Championships will be a pass to play in the Lunar League . James ... What are you plotting this time ? Amazing ! The Lunar League ! Mr. Dan - Mr. Dan ? I felt the wind blowing . he was almost like ... Almost like ... a whirlwind given form ! Basquash ! Princess ! stay under ! Dan ? { ah sound } And I just finished servicing him too ! Dan ! That hurts ! How many times do I have to tell you ? ! Silly Mr. Dan . You can say that again . the best-laid plots never seem to matter much . Plots ? never mind . Shall we go ? So says the child who refused to move all this time . I 'll do it for myself . That 's all . Iceman ? I won 't kill you . I 'll leave you behind me . You 've changed ! that 's all . Dan ! Dan ! All right ! Let 's go for it ! The scattered winds gathered into one to produce an incredible power ! Okay ! Let 's aim for the League ! The League ! Dan sure has gotten pumped up . yo !

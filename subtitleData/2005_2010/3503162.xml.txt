I 'll get there . though . we 're in Los Angeles traveling along with that special breed of hero we like to call the fire department . We should have come earlier . We could be going with them . that 's cool . You got it ? that 's great . That was perfect . We 'll wait for them to get back . You prefer Bob or Robert ? Bob 's good . sorry . Ready ? Okay . Yeah . one . what 's a normal night here at the station ? This might surprise most people but 85 percent of the calls we go out on are medical . It can be anything from chest pain to more serious things . How do you handle that with ambulances and hospitals ? Most ambulances you see are fire department . I didn 't know that . Yeah . And most firefighters are also paramedics . that 's the direction it 's going . something I 'm sure we 're all wondering : Do firefighters still slide down those fabulous poles ? We sure do . No turning back . Tell my mom I loved her . See ? That 's not so bad . I 'm glad I didn 't wear a skirt . That could really hurt your legs . how do you get down when you 're wearing a skirt ? Pantyhose help . Pantyhose . their turnouts . Exactly . Pantyhose . Fire-retardant pantyhose . You heard it here . Can I do it one more time ? Sure . okay ? We 're going to the dining hall . All right . Couple of guys I want you to meet . Cool . Hey . This is Jake . Hey . And Fletcher . Hi . Hi . Nice to meet you . you go . finish eating . We 'll talk after . would you like some ? Yeah .

Just maybe un-tuck your shirt and stick it up here . Okay . Okay . Clip it on your collar . You filming this ? Yeah . Elliot 's been telling me I never give him enough B-roll so I 'm just gonna shoot it all . yeah . If you could keep from rubbing into the mike too much yeah . Don 't worry about the camera . Pretend it 's not even there . Okay . Can you say something ? Give me a level ? one You can just pretend it 's not there . Just talk free . Can you say something more compelling ? I don 't know what to say am I gonna have this thing on all the time ? just watch what you say . We 'll hear everything . Shit . You 're probably not allowed to swear on your station . No . We can cut most of it out . But it helps if you 're not dropping F-bombs . Point noted . Filed right here . So if I was to call this guy an ass-monkey right ? It 's gonna be a long night . So this thing ? Yeah ? Is this some sort of torture device when you don 't get in your turnouts ? That 's what it is . Can you get it ? Yes . This is called a hook ladder . We use this in the The firemen would use this We should bring it down ? Yes . Okay . All right . Can you grab the hook ? So this was used in the ' 20s and the ' 30s . my God . Yeah . And as you can see and the hook at the end they would grasp onto one window and then pull themselves up . they would hook it again . And then pull themselves up . Okay . Scott ? You see this ? Used in the ' 20s and ' 30s . They stopped using it around Hold it up higher . Replaced it right ? Good . Replaced it with a regular ladder that extends ? and rope . They must have tiny feet . Those are little rungs . Yeah . Firemen were a lot smaller back then . The fires were bigger and they were smaller . Don 't tell captain we took this down . I 'm not gonna tell him I touched it . I wanna introduce you to somebody . This is Wilshire . Mark . Wilshire . Say hi . Dog right out of the cartoons . there 's a reason why the Dalmatians were in cartoons . The fire department has a great sense of tradition . we do . Dalmatians got along well with horses . Important when the fire trucks were horse-drawn . Now they 're used as mascots . But what they 're trained to do is run in and stop the traffic . Kind of like Fletch . Yeah . I run out there . Sort of like what a siren does today . Wilshire can show you what to do in case you catch on fire . drop and roll . Yeah . So let 's just pretend you 're 5 years old and on fire . I 'm on fire . Wilshire 's gonna teach you . Tell me what to do . Okay . Wilshire . mark . Stay . drop . Drop . Drop . roll . roll . Good . Look at that . Good boy . Good boy . I 'm gonna live . Report . You 're not gonna be on fire . in case you catch on fire . Wilshire . have some fun . You all hang out a lot ? Yeah . You kind of live together . we definitely live together . Close quarters . ready ? we have 48-hour shifts so we have everything we need in this place a small gym to this handball court . I 'll show it to you . right ? Yeah . you got a call on the office line . Can you pick up a call on the office line ? Non-responder . shoot . Yeah . I was hoping we 'd get a call . Yeah . a little call so we can see action . I guess . Yeah . Gotta be annoying when trying to finish a game . Not if you 're losing . we go respond to a call the points reset . it 's sort of nice . Works in your favor from time to time ? Not in my favor . What are you talking about ? I never lose . I think I 'd roller-skate if I had access to this . I can see you doing that . Yeah . so this is where the men store their boots and turnouts . The pole hole is over here . I know . You got the locker room here . Yep . You got the dorms here . Our viewers always like to see action so maybe we should go into the locker room . Let 's go in the locker room . You got it . I was kidding . guys . We got a female on deck . my God . That 's Griffin . He can 't sing very well . so come this way . He 's got a huge talent . We 're not using this . and this is the Griffin hose . Griffin hose . What the hell ? I hope that 's a wide-angle lens . my God . Stay in there . put that thing away . This is adding a whole new meaning to the term fireman 's hose . my I understand why there are no women here . Plenty of female firefighters . In this station ? not currently . I think I can be a firefighter . it 's a lot harder than it seems . Keep the door closed . You know what ? Pick something you 're good at . I bet you $ 10 I can do it better . You all can be my witnesses . That 's too easy . Ten bucks ? Yeah . How about my place ? I think we 're done here . We got everything we need . Here we go . Listen up . Did you know you were gonna be on camera ? Behind the line . Ready ? Yeah . Ten bucks . You can 't be in the way . I know . Get on that side .

Ten dollars . that 's embarrassing . this is embarrassing . That 's really embarrassing . rolling . Just waiting on something to happen . You wanna go back outside ? See what they 're up to ? Why not ? Careful . Thank you . We 're good . You good ? I think they 're talking about you . Will you turn up his mike ? give me some of that . all right ? A hundred bucks says I can bang her by the morning . come on . I 'll take that bet . You 're so busted . Nice mike . Missed a spot . what ? I said you missed a spot . I know how to hit the spot . Don 't you worry about that . okay ? That 's how you do pick and roll . yeah ? Is that how you do it ? He 'll show you how to do it later . It 's nighttime here and the firefighters take turns sleeping in these rooms here . they can be up and on the truck in under one minute . Let 's check out the room . Can you get in here ? It 's like my college dorm without the pink . 222 Truck 16 . Watch your back . Hey . Looks like you got your call . Just try to keep up . You okay ? come on . Got it ? What you wanna do ?

You seem to have kept shooting . Ready ? set . good . Most little girls wanna be ballerinas or princesses when they grow up . I 'm gonna grow up and be a fireman . I am truly living the dream . I don 't think we can use any of it . I am still living the dream . go ahead . we got a eight at 3 o 'clock . Keep calling out numbers . What are you doing ? Jake 's the engineer . He 's actually a third-generation engineer but I have the most important job . Navigating ? I 'm in charge of the chick-o-meter . I rate them . So if I say there 's a eight at 3 o 'clock the guys know they better look to the right . it 's really funny . I always thought firemen were so dignified . no . I signed up for brave and courageous . I think we get that by now . I see a nine at 2 . we got a nine at 2 . Yeah . that 's a dude . not a dick-o-meter . I think we 're good . You 're fired . You can 't talk anymore .

 My name is Jane Vasco . I could use you on my team . I work for a secret government agency that hunts Neuros . People who can do dangerous things with their minds . On my first assignment ... something a little weird happened , okay , something really weird . Until I get some answers I 'm getting on with my life , doing my job ... stocking up on aspirin ... because I gotta tell ya , pain 's a bitch ! When you spend a lot of time with the people you work with , you get to know them well . Even if you 've never been to their home , you can ... imagine how they live . When I visited Andre , his place was clean , organised . And I guess you could say , manly . Except for the box of Captain Crunches ? kitchen . He claimed is from when his niece visits . Sure . Been to Mo 's place lots of times . The surroundings fit a woman . Haven 't seen Riley 's pad , but I can imagine stacks of comic books , tech gear and cifi memorabilia . As for Connor , let 's just say , I plan to wash my hands for a long time , with really hot water and industrial soap , after I live . - Vasco . - Nice hardware . You 're damn right . I only mean the bike . - What are you doing here ? - We got a lead on the kids . Riley is been trying to raise you in the comm all morning . And you volunteered to come by personally . We drew straws . I lost . Briefing is at 14 : 00 . That 's two hours from now . A lot could happen in two hours . You 're being modest . I 'm sure you can get the job done in two minutes . Two minutes . Just enough time to talk down these heads . Maybe you shouldn 't be playing with sharp instruments . Oh , it 's just a burn . Coffee maker blew a gas skin on me . It 's more organised than I thought it would be . - You expected a scattered mess ? - Something like that . Well , not me . Work 's chaotic enough . I got to come home to something different . Yeah , I know . Thanks ! Maybe you should play with toy boats instead . That was close . - I must 've made contact with the terminals . - You must have . In the future , it might be a good idea to disengage the gears ... - ... before you lay hands on that thing . - I always do . Almost always . McBride . Car is up front . PAINKILLER JANE - Season 01 Episode 11 " GHOST IN THE MACHINE " Chinese tradition puts a lot of stock on names . They believe you can make your destiny by what you call yourself . Joyful fortune . Whoever chose that name was hoping for not just success but ... pleasure in it . I wonder if they got either . All right , let 's focus . These maybe kids but they 're killers . Until we find out which one is the Neuro , they 're all deadly . Riley , talk to me . A triangulation puts our boys in the loading bay . Guys , could you hear me ? Andre , what 's going on ? - Shoot them ! Shoot them ! - Which one ? The window sill is broken ! Is the one furthest from the window ! - Ok guys , I 'm back . Is everything ok ? - Yeah , we 're all right . Let Seth know we 're coming in . We 're gonna need some looking over . Come on , boss . What the hell was that ? Ultrasonics would be my guess . - So , only that one kid was the Neuro ? - Yeah , that was more than enough . - You 're ok ? - Yeah . My boot is worse than my ears . Oh , thanks for patching me up , doc . I appreciate it . That 's what I 'm here for . Come to the hospital for a pair of X-rays ... and I 'll set you up with some painkillers . I think I 'll be fine . Of course you will . All right , that should hold you till the bone heals . Try to stay off of it . Not your day , is it ? - The burn , the bike ... now your foot . - I 'm backing the odds . I think maybe I 'll buy a lottery ticket . You think there could be another explanation ? Yeah , bad day . Crap happens . That 's life . Since you 're so concerned , maybe you 'd be interested in turning my luck up , eh ? I think maybe you should be more concerned than I am . You 're still here ? Something 's in your mind . Do you believe in coincide ? I believe in getting strait to the point . Connor . There a hot I don 't know about him . Yes , that 's true . And that is not a coincidence . You know more about his past than anyone on the team . I know what I need to know , Jane . And you know what you need to know . Did you know he had three accidents today ? A coffee machine blew up on his face ... his bike almost took his leg off and ... the door . If something or someone from his past has resurfaced ... and all what 's happened isn 't a coincidence ... then the whole team could be in jeopardy . Look , I don 't know what 's going on here , but I don 't feel comfortable waiting around for the next thing to just happen . So , I 'm supposed to act based on your feelings ? No . On yours . You 're not actually taking this seriously , are you ? I have to , Connor , is my job . Well , I thing you should tell Vasco to stick to doing what she does best . Remaining invulnerable to injuries and everyone else around her . Sounds like you take that personally . As of today we should be drinking , not thinking . So , tell me ... Exactly what is it you 're trying to avoid thinking about ? A guy can 't have a drink with a friend ? It 's your timing that concerns me . - Here we go . - We made a deal ... when I first took you aboard that you 'd tell me everything that I needed to know . - And I made good on that . - As far as you know , you have . But I had Riley check the specks on that door . Just write down the code . Redundant safeties . There 's no way that think could have blown , - ... unless someone tampered with it . - You 're starting to sound like Vasco Is too bad there 's not enough of this to make you look like her . Just talk to me . If there 's something , anything , in your past , any unfinished business , whatever it is , I need to know . Even if there was , what are we talking about here ? I mean , there was nobody in the garage when the train slid to new gear . And besides us and the freak boy squad , there was no one in the warehouse . I have a closet full of skeletons , we both know that . But they 're dead skeletons . They hate coming back to life ... to haunt my coffee maker . Now here , drink this . You 're making me nervous . CONNER KING MALE - USA INCIDENT REPORT - GENERAL WARRANT FOR ARREST - FORM 9 I ignore what 's we 're looking for here . And for all we know , Jane is making a big deal out of nothing . Hello ? Somebody here ? Anybody ? Is there anybody here ! ? - Waiting for these ? - Yeah , right . There 's no gear in here for the part of my body that I 'd like to exercise . - You might want to reconsider that . - Why , do I look out of shape to you ? - What 's on your mind , Riley ? - Oh , maybe staying awake all night , working up a full history profile on Connor ? - Yeah , that sounds like a great time . - It wasn 't . Andre said it was your idea . Something about you having a hunch that someone from Connor 's past ... might be reaching out to ... touch him ? - Yeah . I guess it was . - Ok , a hunch ? - An educated guess . - No , no a hunch . Without the data to confirm the facts it 's a hunch . It paid off in the past . You 're telling me you 've never had a hunch ? No , I haven 't . And you know , I 've never seen a ghost ... been abducted by aliens , found the truth of my life through astrology ... or you know what ? Been granted three wishes by a genie . Well , by the sound of your enthusiasm , my hunch paid off . Ok , yes . Maybe , ok , but that 's not the point . I think it is . Learn to live with it , Riley . - By the way , what is your sign ? - Easy . - Yeah , you what . - My sign ... Barrier Precinct Tactical Response Squad . This photo was taken 12 years ago . What the hell is this all about ? - You authorized this ? - Connor , 5 of these men are now dead . Davis Monfredo was driving a combine on his father 's farm and got stock in the gears . It sucked him in up to his waist before they could shut it off . Kevin Douglas pinned between a forklift and loading dock . Crushed his pelvis . Gottschalk , Rubin , both died in car accidents . Now , yes , taken separately maybe accidental . But we put them all together ... And what we 're looking for is a man who knows how to beat the safeties ... - ... on an industrial fire door . - And out of vintage motorcycle . Last one was Joey Berlin ... Got mabbled in a generator last night at batsmen department store . 11 miles from here . Connor , can you make a call on this ? Relax , they 're coming . You know , when you get out of prison , you think , " I did it . " " I did my time . " But you pull enough crap in this life , - ... you never stop doing time . - You 've any idea what this is about . Come on , I haven 't seen these guys in 10 years . - Did any of these guys do time with you ? - Hell , no . We were the pride of the precinct . The dream team . - Immaculate and untouchable ! - Untouchable ? Well , someone is trying to get back in touch with you . Now , who 'd have a reason ? Well , we pulled away a lot of creeps . You wanna a list ? Some of those ... Thank you . Some of those guys you put away were wearing blue , right ? I told you . Not on this team . - Hey , just go easy , will you ? - None of this is easy . Are you sure you 're not painting these guys ... a brighter shade of white , just because you want to ? Look , I know who I am and what I 've done . I don 't need to cover my reality . Yeah , I noticed . Here 's the deal , Connor . Right now you 're at risk and you 're putting the whole team at risk . What do you want I should do . Crawl to a hole ? Close enough . Until this is over you lie low . You go underground . But if that takes weeks ? If it takes weeks , I 'll buy you another bottle of reality . Go easy . Wine waits for no man . Are you almost done ? Yeah , I just have to double check a couple of these quotes ... and then ship it off to my editor . I 'll get that for you . I didn 't know you liked crosswords . Or should I say , " love " crosswords ? I had some time to kill in the laundry room yesterday . You should do laundry more often . You get about three week of dirty clothes there . Just a couple of hours . You did a whole stack of crosswords in a couple of hours ? In pen ? Wow , I should watch my back around you . I 'll watch yours . - Something I said ? - No . Just something I did . - Those puzzles . - No crime in being smart . Guess I 'm just a lot smarter than I thought I was . Obviously . You chose me . As I recall , you picked me . - Really ? - Yeah . Two smart people , eh ? Thing that 'll work out . As long as attack records go to me . You know , for a girl who likes to come across as a tough guy , you ought to hide your Bronte collection . - It reveals the romantic on you . - You 've been searching my bookshelves ! - Reporter . Occupational hazard . - You gonna write my history ? I always said I 'm gonna try and get to know it . And I hope it 's very long ... with lots of installments . Timing is everything . This better be extremely important . - Hello .. - Jane , it 's Andre . - I need you to get over to Connor 's . - I thought he was ... - ... " out of town " . - Yeah , he 's lying low . but he remembered some letters written by a couple of guys from his old squad . Now , they are a few years old , but they 're making this more personal insight ... I want Riley can bring up on his computer . - They 're in a box in his garage . - Right now ? - Yes , right now . Is there a problem ? - No , no . It 's fine . Good . Now , when you 're there I want you to dig around ... for anything else that might be relevant . Listen , Jane , none of us is perfect . And that definitely includes Connor . He might be withholding information like to jeopardize us all , especially himself . - Yeah , I 'll take care of it . - Good , you call me when you 're done . Right . I gotta go . Will you promise to hold that last thought ? No , it was more than a thought . But don 't worry about it , it 's not gonna change for quite some time . Nice to meet you too ! This will be a lot easier if you just told me where King is . Who the hell are you ? You are gonna find out right now ! I just wanna talk to him . He was tall , about six feet , short hair , silver , with a little bit of black still left on the sides . That rings any bells ? Yeah , about a million guys trying slots in Vegas . This wasn 't his first fight . The guy knew what he was doing with the knife . You got those photos ? I ran an aging program on the old photo . These are the surviving members of Connor 's team . That 's him ! - William Hoyt Pierce . - Senior officer . We lost touch when I went to state . Looks like his feeling nostalgic . Riley , current address ? Oh , the guy is law enforcement . Lives always on the move , no fixed address . The guy is off the radar completely . Are you saying you can 't find him ? I never say never . Maybe we need to let him to find us . OUTSIDE CONNOR 'S GARAGE Connor , we 've got you in sight . Nothing running except for one vehicle . There ! King ! Pierce was here and never changed position . The truck made no course corrections . Pierce was the intended target the whole time . He wasn 't after you . He was trying to warn you . Or kill me because he thought I was behind it . And the truck showed no sign of mechanical tampering . And no one behind the wheel . So we 're looking for a guy who can control a 5 ton truck ... without touching it . Only to alert the surviving team members , then . One guy got his legs caught in a combine , the second was crushed form the pelvis down ... and the third who was jagged into the generator , was this feet first ? - Yeah . - Connor near misses . Anyone of them could have caught his leg off . Connor , can you thing of anyone who 'd have any reason to take ... these guys from the bottom up ? Beeman . Harry Beeman . Fire doors ! Hit us with a system breach ! - Lock down engaged ! - Intruders ? I can 't tell , the system has gone crazy ! Let 's asume the worst . Seth , secure position ! - Riley ! Release the weapons locker ! - It should be open ! - No , it isn 't ! - Well something is jamming me ! Override did not go ! Don 't ' you waste that ammo . We have no idea what 's coming on that tunnel . - We have , what , 3 rounds each ? - There should be extra mags in the fridge ! - Seth ? - Help ! Help ! - Seth ! - Seth ! Riley , the door ! Everybody back ! Everybody back ! Help ! Close , eh ? Thanks . - Riley , what 's you status ? - System is completely down . All right , check his side arms . Connor , divide up those extra mags ? Yes . Look , there 's only long range clips on the fridge . and all that rifles and scopes they are on the weapons locker . Remind me to store more stuff in the fridge . Fire doors came slamming down . Manual override is jammed . That means we 're sealed in . Someone is turning our own security against us . - Harry . - You knew this day was coming . - You earned it . - This is my station . These are my people . You will explain yourself to me . I don 't answer to you ! I don 't answer to anybody ! Not since the day Mr. King left me in the building ... where tons of rubble came down on me . It was the standard prep extraction , Harry . No one knew you were at the place with C4 No one could have . Except maybe the cowards that set me in first . - It could have been all of us . - It should have been all of us ! But you moved on . Got a new team . Brave captain . But for me , things just stay the same . In this chair , every day . That 's my life , thinking about what could have been . Thinking about what should have been , and what shouldn 't . And then your life changed , didn 't it ? You developed special powers . Yeah . Funny , eh ? I can 't move my legs , but I can move a half ton truck , and all sorts of other interesting things , like loading docks , 0door and motorcycle gears , without having to lift so much as a finger . Guess somebody out there is looking out for me . - No ! - Joe ! You won 't take me out with machines . Machines serve me ! He 's gone . Joe ! He 's gone ! Answering the light . - Joe , can you hear me ? - Seth , the train , if he rolls it ... Joe is down there . We can 't leave him . Go help . Look , nobody hung Beeman up to try . That mission was by the books . It was just ... damn stupid luck that he went in there first . And now is hard damn stupid luck that he can use all this equipment against us . You wan me to apologise for the past , and I will . But I didn 't pull him in that chair . That 's not how he went down . Connor ? Somehow I don 't think an apology is gonna work ... with talk and revenge here the guy has been doing for years . Might 've started that way but I don 't thing that 's what it is now . Seth and Joe , they aren 't part of his past . They weren 't on his squad . Look , he knows that I 'll give a crap is he takes me out first . He 's enjoying himself . He 's showing me what he can do to the team before he takes me down . - The flashlights too ? - He 's coming on us again . Crap . You looking ok , Joe . I 'm not , but I 'm doing what I can . Good work , Seth . - What the hell is he doing ? - He 's waiting . He 's got the advantage . Riley , what do we got left ? Still part of the security grid , but ... I 've been blocked out . I think our Neuro is using our grid to spy us . That 's how he knows where we are . I will not be able to open the doors , until Riley regains control of the system . There 's another way out . The original engineers put on those fire doors to protect the line . They put and emergency evacuation shaft too . - Where ? - Through the ventilation tunnel , There 're ladders , manual hatches . This went up to the streets . - Well , lead on . - I 'll stay . I leave here , he 's gonna keep on coming . In case some let him kill you , you thing 's gonna stop ? No , idiot . But I have un idea . And I could use your help . Are you asking me for help ? Are you gonna do it or call a press conference ? - Fine , I 'm in . - Good . Get everybody out of here . All right . I 'll be back , with some fire power . I wanna hurry . - Let 's go ! - Good . Wait down here . All right ; your call , boss . It 's just down this way . - This is it . - From all the way out . - Sure you can make it , Joe ? - I 'll raise you . We 'll do it together . Ok , it is locked . - Joe , what the hell is that ? - That 's crazy . These have been disconnected for 15 years . It doesn 't seem to bother Beeman . Please , tell me we 're not gonna get sucked up into that fan . Doesn 't have that kind of draw . Feel the breeze ? - Those are fans . - They 're spinning in reverse . They 're no bringing air into the shaft . They 're sucking it out . We 'll make our way up the tracks . Make it look like we know where we 're going . That we ... have a way out . If Beeman is watching us ... maybe he 'll come out of his hiding place to stop us . And you need me for this plan because ... ? I want to keep you close to me , so I can keep my eye on you . Look , I don 't know if can help the others . Maybe they can help themselves but ... you 're the one that matters to me . Probably the only thing that 's mattered to me in a long time . And if Beeman knows how I feel about you that puts you on the spotlight . If anything ever happened to you ... it 'll be worst than hell . How much air you thing we have ? We 'll know when we run out of breath . There 's a manual hatch at the top . If we can get there in time . Riley , let 's check it out . - Ok . - Come on , hassle up . Ok , I 'm going . I don 't think we 've much time left . Don 't stop , Riley . Keep going . The air 's starting to thin out . Come on ! Got to get that hatch open . Andre ! I am working on it ! No one could have seen that coming , right Connor ? It 's just bad luck you sent her in first . Question : Can you live with yourself now ? ! Yeah , I can live with myself . Hey , girl , are you all right ? The only woman I know that can get hit by a train and live to tell about it . It looks like it might 've hurt . Boss , the fan ! The door ! Try the door ! - What ? - - Open the door ! It 's clear ! All right , let 's go , come on . - Is everybody ok ? - All in one peace . When the fan stopped we knew you must 've done it ... You chipped him ! I stopped him . Aren 't you afraid those things turning up and ripping your face off ? Maybe I forget it was someone else 's turn to have a homicidal Neuro ... on their trail this week . Lightning only strikes once , uh ? Well , the bike has got to get fixed . You think on your feet , Vasco , I 'll give you that . When a guy starts declaring his undying affection wakes you up . And knowing how sensitive and romantic you are , I knew you were up to something . And being in love with me obviously wasn 't it . No , obviously . I mean , Beeman was watching us . I figured we 'd give him a show . I was betting on the fact that maybe he 'd hate me just enough to take it out on you . - Lucky me . - Well , it worked . It did at that . You get a lot of that guys declaring ? I 'm a girl . Occupational hazard . Anything I can do to help ? - Yeah , you can hand me that torque wrench . - This ? That 's the one . So , how long have you been working on it ? About 9 months . - Your baby . - You see , that 's the thing . Women never appreciate the beauty of a well built machine . I 'm not so sure about that . You know what they say about judging books by their covers . Maybe it 's the same with people . Some of us work hard to present a cover to the world around us . Even to the people we 're closest to . The kind of cover that makes people walk by ... without ever picking up the book . The pages remain unread ... and there 's nothing to be learnt between the lines . Hey , are you gonna help or watch ? - Oh , yeah . - Give me the ratchet over there . - This ? - That will do .

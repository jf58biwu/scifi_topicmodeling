Today we fight to stop Skynet from ever being created . To change our future . To change his fate . The war to save mankind begins now . Season 1 Episode 2 Gnothi Seauton ( v. 1.06 ) Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . I haven 't seen you around here before . - Did you just move here ? - Yeah . Sucks for you . We can 't stay here . No one knows us . We 're safe . Don 't you think that , John ! No one is ever safe . FBI . Your fiancée killed a man because she believes that in the future , he 'll invent a computer system that declares war on the world . - Cameron Phillips ? - Here . Do we have a John Reese ? Excellent . Come with me if you wanna live . I 'm not who they think I am . You changed the future , you just didn 't change it enough . So you can do it again . You wanna stop Skynet ? This is the way . Mom . We gotta go , now ! Do it ! - Where are we ? - Same where . Different when . A wise man once said " know thyself . " Easier said than done . I 've had 9 aliases , 23 jobs , spoken 4 languages and spent 3 years in a mental hospital for speaking the truth . At least when I was there , I could use my real name . Through it all , I 've always known who I am and why I 'm here . Protect my son . Prepare for the future . But lately it 's gotten harder to control . Even as I try to help John find firm ground in this new world , the battlefield shifts beneath our feet . Maybe it 's all catching up to me . Maybe if you spend your life hiding who you are , you might finally end up fooling yourself . Hey , how 's it going ? All right . You bought me the wrong needle nose pliers though . I did ? You said red handles . I 'm sorry . I ... I guess I 'm still ... - I don 't know . - I 've been calling it time-lag . - What ? - It 's like jetlag , but for time travel . Time-lag . Yeah , sounds about right . Hey , you know what would really help with time-lag ? Some fresh air . John . I 've been cooped up here for three days . I know . No , you don 't know , because you keep going outside . And so will you when we get new IDs . - So let 's get them already . - We will . Can you be patient , please ? It 's not just a name . It 's a legend . A life . A whole new you . We go through this every time . This is different . New IDs today ? It 's been three days . I want my new name . I want that whole new me . Can 't you track down Enrique ? All right , I 'll track down Enrique . Old friend . Ten years ago he was the best fake paper guy around . John sent back better ones . You cannot walk into the living room after three days , three days , and now after three days now you tell me there are other people here ? Resistance fighters . Resistance fighters . Humans . Sent back from the future by John . And what ? Are they manning some kind of apocalyptic paramilitary convenience store filled with fake IDs , and guns , and money ? Yes . - You done yelling at her yet ? - I 'm not yelling . Right . So look , mom , there 's no turkey . - Turkey . It 's in there , John . - No . Just move the food around and the turkey will reveal itself to you . Mom , I already looked . There 's no ... Oh , yeah , there it is . Thanks . And stay inside . No ID means ... Yeah , I know what no ID means . How many guys are we meeting ? Four . These resistance fighters , they know you ? They 've seen me before . I 've seen that before . - Kyle Reese had one . - Skynet work camp . Prisoner . Off ! Please remain calm . Oh , my god . You told me we 'd be safe ! Safe ! Was that safe ? Three days and we 're at war . Why jump at all ? Why not stay in the past ? I had seven more years to get ready . To get him ready . No , you wouldn 't have . Why not ? Because you died ... two years ago . December 4 , 2005 . You died . So what I 'm getting is these things , they 're here . All over , I guess . And they some of them , all of them , are programmed with specific missions . The one at the safe house was sent there for those fighters . Skynet doesn 't know you 're here . There 's no directive to hunt you . So if I was to walk right by one ... - They 'll walk right by you . - They don 't know what you look like . That 's really awesome . And what if they found out who he was ? Would they all know what to do then ? - They do . - Awesome . So school regiration is at 3 : 00 tomorrow . Do you think we can have all this sorted out by then ? Can 't you just be happy being yourself for a little while longer ? Just sit still ? It 's not so bad being a Connor . That 's easy for you to say . Is it ? You all put back together , Tin Man ? Tin Man ? You ready to go ? Thank you for explng . You stay here . Still like a statute . - Enrique ? - Statue . Yeah , I 've been a statue for the last three days . We 'll be back . I did paramilitary training with Enrique outside of Oaxaca . He taught John to shoot rifles . So what you said before . Is that why we 're really here ? Did John , the future John , did he send you back to help me jump over my death ? Is everything else a lie ? No . He sent us here to fight . You 're the best fighter he knows . - I 'm sure that 's not - The best . So if I 'm such a great fighter , how was I killed ? Cancer . We 're here . Hey , it 's John . I 'm not here right now . You know what to do . Hey , sorry I missed you , but leave a message and I 'll call you back ... probably . You 've reached the future leader of mankind . It may take me a little while to get back to you , but leave a message anyway . 818-555-0147 . Leave a message . Statue . Screw it . I 'm not surprised . I know I looked surprised when I saw you in that first moment . But I am not surprised . Do you know this woman well ? It 's rhetorical . If you don 't , you don 't . But if you do , an you 're anything like her , you 'll lie and say you don 't . But if you do , then I know that you , like me , are not surprised . And John . He 's a man now . He 's grown up . He misses you . I need three sets of papers . I can pay . Not a lot , but some . Why not ? I 'm finished with that life . What ? Are you familiar with Ricardo Lopez ? The boxer from Cuernavaca . He is very famous in my country . His nickname is El Finito . - Finisher . - Yes . He fought 52 fights . 51 victories , one draw . And no losses , zero . I don 't understand . I wanted to be El Finito . To retire undefeated . I lived my wild life . I fought the wars I wanted to . And a few I did not . But I lived every day free . Not one day behind bars . Nor in the hands of the enemy . So now I am finished . El Finito . Happy for you . Sorry for me , but happy for you . Don 't give up so easy ! I did not say I can 't help . My nephew , Carlos , has , how we say , taken over the family business . His operation is very good . But he is not a believer . Few believers left , I think . You 're a very quiet girl . Who 's Charlie Dixon ? You shouldn 't surf with the demo . People get in your business . Clear your history too . - My history ? - What you 've been looking at . Snoopy people , dude . Snoopy people all over . - Got a special on those . - No , maybe later . Thanks . Carlos ? Enrique sent us . What the hell ? Pipe their crazy asses down . Wait at the car . Something about your friend I should know ? Cat person . - Want a soda or something ? - I 'm good . We got the old-fashioned soda machine . Little bottles . It 's a collectible now . Jose ! Soda , por favor . My uncle , he 's very good at keeping secrets . Young , I 'd see him at family barbecues , I 'd try to get him to tell me his secrets . - How did that work out for you ? - Not so good . Except one day , about eight years ago , I find him in the kitchen . A bottle of Patrón and the Times . You know whose picture 's on the front page ? Only time I ever see my uncle cry . - He 's a good man . - Not for me to say , but he 's my uncle . And you 're as close as I 'm gonna get to one of his secrets . - So I 'm gonna give you what you need . - Thank you . 20000 . What ? I don 't have that . 20000 . That 's a family discount in these hard times . Especially for someone who 's been dead eight years . That 's extortion . War on terrorism makes this the front lines , lady . Some raghead gets fake papers down here , we 're all going to Guantanamo . 9 / 11 doubled prices overnight . 9 / 11 . What 's that ? Hey , baby girl . What did I tell you about hanging around ? Who 's your new friend here ? She someone I need to know ? 'Cause the longer you stand around , the more I think I need to know her . You got a name ? No . This your car ? No . It 's definitely not my car . See , I know just about everyone in this neighborhood , and you are not one of those everyone . Now you got me wondering not just who you are , that you won 't say , but why you 're here . And that you won 't say . You know , it 's not uncommon in these neighborhoods for a gang dealing in drugs to store their drugs inside of a stolen car . That way no drugs can be found on their property or on any property belonging to them . But they also like to leave a lookout , sometimes a pretty girl , to watch their stash . Now you don 't mind if I call this license plate in , do you ? Jenny ! Jennifer ! How many times have I told you to stop seeing that little punk ass ? I swear to God . Is he meeting you here ? Is he meeting you here ? Ma 'am ! - You know this girl ? - Yes , I know this girl . Do I have any choice but to know you , you spoiled little bitch ? Do you do domestic complaints officer ? Can I make a domestic complaint against my spoiled little stepdaughter for making me wanna beat my own brains in ? It 's her real mother 's fault . Can I tell you what she lets her do ? - Ma 'am , is this your car ? - Why would I drive that piece of crap ? 'Cause I will send you back to private school . The one with the uniforms . They will dress you like a flannel sock . Maybe you can have this conversation somewhere else , like at home perhaps ? - Out of gang territory . - Gang territory ? Of course . Thank you , Officer . Come on . It 's 13 miles to walk home . We need another car . Were you gonna kill that cop ? Don 't answer that . Don 't wanna know . We need rules . Aren 't you supposed to take orders or something like that ? - I do . From John . - From John . - So if I tell John to forbid you ... - Not this John . Not this John . Aren 't they the same ? Not yet . I cannot imagine the apocalypse . No matter what kyle reece told me , or others who have come back . I cannot imagine 3 billion dead . I can imagine planes hitting buildings , and I can imagine fire . If I would 've witnessed it , if I would 've been here , I 'm sure I would 've thought the end was near . I 'm sure I would 've thought ... we have failed . John ? Johnny ? Is it really you ? It is you . I saw a picture of your mother on the television and I could ... barely believe my ... I can 't believe this . Don 't come any closer . Stop . You came to my house . - You married ? - Yeah , I am . She 's a nurse at the hospital where I work . That 's nice . It 's good . Johnny , what happened ? Stop . Johnny , it 's okay . - Please stop . - No , no , Johnny . It 's me , Johnny ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Hey . How 'd it go with Enrique ? El Finito is a true believer , but he is finished with the life . What ? We need 20 grand . It 's a long story . That taking you a while ? Yeah , it 's taking me a while . I gotta , you know , strip wires and ... John has a high level of stress . Genetics are a bitch . I did a brief analysis . Surface skin temperature high . Salinity high . Pulse abnormal . That 's ' cause the kid snuck out while we were gone . Wouldn 't look me in the eye . His shoes are wet with grass . Don 't need to be a Tin Man to figure that one out . Just a mom . - Where did he go ? - Worry about that later . Just need to make sure he doesn 't do it again . I didn 't know that was something you could do . The skin trick . I should know about your skills or whatever . Like can you analyze blood ? Can you scan someone ? You mean Computed Axial Tomography ? - Cat scans ? - Yeah . That . Can you do that ? No . Get your shoes on . Do you want your new name or what ? You sure there 's money here ? Money , guns , anything they valued . It will be hidden . It 's always hidden . Yeah , well , whatever they had , let 's hope the cops didn 't get to it first . Let 's hope our metal friend didn 't find it . Our metal friend was only here to kill that fourth fighter when he came home . Nice to know we spoiled that . It 'll find him . That 's ridiculous . People do like small animals . Yeah , but ... I don 't know how to explain this . Some badass soldier is not gonna have a kitty poster on the wall . Mom . Do what you do , girly . What ? They rigged it . What did she say ? 120 seconds before the system reboots ? We gotta get in there , John . We can 't come back . We 'll find the money some other way . No , whatever 's in there , I want it now . Numbers . What are the numbers ? What can the numbers be ? Damn . Fingerprints . It 's a date . Judgment day . What are those ? Why are diamonds a girl 's best friend ? What ? Why are diamonds a girl 's best friend ? Where 'd you get that ? John gave it to me . He did , did he ? That was sweet of him . We have a whole bag of them . Do you want one ? - They 're a girl 's best friend . - Not this girl . I know what the Tin Man is . He needed a heart . The Wonderful Wizard of OZ , written by L. Frank baum in 1900 . - First published in ... - I know all about The Wizard of OZ . When John was little , I ... You read it to him over and over again in spanish . He never told you , but it was one of his favorite things that you did . He used to talk about it a lot . Okay , shoppers . 98 for this dvd / cd player with remote ... Hey , who ... Who the hell are you ? What are you doing here , man ? This is my house , man . " Chet . " What 's with the trespassing ? And the visor ... Chet ? Oh , Chet ... They 're exactly like you asked . These ain 't just forgeries . This is full service . You 're in the system and everything . Collect welfare with ' em if you want . We might have to . Didn 't take you long to round that up , so I 'm feeling the price was right . Maybe you 'd have gone another ten gs . Uncle Enrique will be proud . So I miss the next family barbecue . Charlie ... you okay ? You 've been a little , you know , out of it all night . No , I 'm good . I 'm fine . I just ... I had a rough call . Some guy on meth . God , babe , want me to take a look at that ? No , no , I 'm good . I 'm good . - You sure ? - Yeah . Love you . Yeah , I love you too . Carlos was right . $ 20,000 wasn 't that much money . A new identity , a new life , a chance . You can 't put a price on that . But unlike John , I was never eager for that new life to begin . I liked having no name , no story . It was the only time I got to be me . Unfortunately , sometimes you have to pay for that . And the price was getting higher every day . Sarah . You can either drink it or dump it . I say drink it . Anything I should know ? - Excuse me ? - Anything I should know ? Anything you forgot to tell me ? Neglected . Lied about . First and last chance . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Please ... put the gun down and explain . El Finito . El Finito . Yes , what about it ? Not a day behind bars . Lived a life of freedom . - Yes ! - That 's not what carlos said . My nephew is a thief and a liar . - I told you ... - He was speaking spanish to his crew . He referred to you as a rata . Slang for " snitch , " isn 't it ? - You must have heard him wrong . - A rata . Rat . Denunciente . Informer . Certain words I know and don 't forget . Are you selling people out ? Are you selling me out , Enrique ? Okay . Okay . I was in Lompoc many years ago . On a federal gun charge . - You said you never ... - Three weeks . Only three weeks . And you made a deal ? You talked ? No , I gave information on my cellmate . He had kidnapped a child and put her in his trunk , and drove her from Oregon . He told me ... he told me where he dumped her . And ... they dropped my charge , yes . But that was all . That was all I gave . And yes , I lied to you . But where I grew up , where we grew up , a man doesn 't ... you know ... Colaborador . It 's another one . - It means the same thing . - Why would you do this ? Did you hear what he said ? We don 't know . We don 't know . He was possibly lying . Possibly ? You just executed him on possibly ? He had a family ! Why would you do this ? Cause you wouldn 't . How do you know what I would and would not do ? You don 't know me . You don 't know me ! And you don 't know my son . Not John . Not my John . You don 't know what I would and wouldn 't do . I don 't even know what I would and wouldn 't do . I wake up this morning and you tell me ... I don 't know anything anymore . I don 't even rememberwhat my name is . Sarah Connor . So , where are you from ? Lawrence , Kansas , actually . It 's a pretty good size city . About 80,000 . Go to Kansas City often ? Well , Lawrence is about 50 miles east of Kansas City . 25 miles west . - I knew that . - What about your father ? Your father . Did you leave him behind in Lawrence , Kansas ? Your father 's dead . He was a police officer . He died apprehending a criminal . - He 's a hero . - Yeah , I know that . My dad 's always a hero . And he 's always dead . Did you go out late last night ? No , why ? Motion detectors . I thought I heard a beep . Probably her . She just walks and walks . Look , if you want to hold me out another few days until I get these stupid stories straight ... - You 're going to school . - But ... At least that way I 'll know where you are . And who you 're with . Mom . What ? Never mind . Who do you think , Agent ? Perhaps you think I was retired , yes ? That I did not have my ear to the street ? If you return my call , I believe I may have something of interest for you . Muy expensivo , but of great interest . El Finito will not disappoint . Attention , all students . Class schedules will be available in Cahuenga Hall at 3 : 30 . Know thyself . John once told me it 's inscribed on the front of the Temple of Apollo . Then entire quote is , " know thyself and thou shall know all the mysteries of the gods and of the universe . " That 's quite a mouthful . My version is this . Know thyself because what else is there to know ? People hide secrets . Time is a lie . The material world can disappear in an instant . It has and it will again . The doctor will see you in a few minutes , Ms. Baum . Our identities change . Our names , the way we look , how we act and speak . We 're shape shifters . There is no control . No constant . No shelter but the love of family and the body god gave us . And we can only hope that that will always be enough .

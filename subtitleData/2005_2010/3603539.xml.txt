 Aziris Nuna It did it again . Good morning , Kostik . Good morning , chufufihiha . Where do you know these words from , you son of a desert jackal ? Wait a moment , I 'm a desert jackal ? Forgive me for the chufufiha , Mom , I found it in the Ancient-Egyptian textbook , it means " archaeologist 's wife " . It 's cool , right ? In ancient Egyptian that sounds like Chufufe and Viha . Work on your pronunciation , son . Vuefiha ? Practically , it 's better than desert jackal . Hello ? Yes , it 's me . It cracked in front of you ? And what 's inside ? Metal ? Impossible ! No , don 't tell anybody for now . Yes , I 'm coming now . Looks like Dad is about to invent something again . See , the other archaeologists do what they are supposed to ! They dig up skulls and flower pots but he wants to trace extra-terrestrial civillizations ! Breakfast , boys ! Galya , let 's discuss something while the kids aren 't here . Just don 't get nervous , I think this is important . Kostya . Just don 't tell me you found an ancient space device . How do you know ? Well , you keep finding them all the time . Where this time , if not a secret ? Tell me , what do you know about the sphinx head in the museum storage-room ? It was found in Egypt , 2 centuries ago . Galya , wait . And you sit . Sit yourself . The museum warden just called and told me that the sphinx head started cracking . Seems like such a great invention ! Don 't be so quick to make fun of me , inside there is ... Something made of metal ! What ? That . And what do you plan to do ? What do you mean what , we take a chisel and hammer and go to break its head . Wait , you are a scientist , not some kind of vandal . You understand that this head is several thousand years old . And whatever 's hidden in it , as you know , is as old . Dad isn 't right ! A spaceship . That 's right ! At the end , even if it 's not a spaceship . There are no such finds in archaeology . Be more quiet , the kids are here . Wipe yourself off . You can start eating , me and Dad will go by the museum . Yes , we have soemthing to do there . But today is sunday ! And the park ? The cinema ? - No . You promised ! - I 'm sorry boys , but not today . Well ... If we promised . Ok , eat breakfast , get dressed and hurry up ! Come on , quicker , before we change our decision . You are always like this ! Seryoja , lets do it Monday ! At least think where could it be ? Where ? By the way I know where mom and dad hide the storage keys . Dad said that in the storage room they brought for restoration the mummy of Nemenkhotep IV . And you know what mummies look like . Oooh . We are scared already . Yeah right . Don 't be scared . You 'll be with me . I wonder how can a man be restorated . Hes not a man , he 's an exhibit – a mummy . Like Lenin . Cool . I think we are done for today . Ok , repeat your Ancient Egyptian , brush your teeth and to bed . What ? Let 's do the Ancient Egyption tomorrow . I think we overdid it , Galya . It 's ok , they 'll need it in life Ok , go . Stop . How do you say in pharaoh language " good night ? " . Aziris nuna , mom . Aziris nuna , dad . Aziris nuna , kids . I 'm the mummy . You don 't look like it . I got the keys from the storage . So , nuna ? Nuna ! Hey , don 't shine on the pharaoh ! Should we go home ? Why do you behave like a kid ? You want me to turn it off at the most interesting part ? Just don 't get scared . Oooh ! A little hole . What are you doing , can 't you help me ? You stand here , and I here . You think it will ? Yes , I know what I 'm doing . Come on , 3 ... We must ... We have to go , That 's it ! Wait , I forgot the flashlight . I told you , don 't get scared . Ok , and what 's this button for ? It works ! Come in here . Its so cool ! The mummy came to life . Enough already , ok ? Where 's your mummy ? Well ... If ... Dum dum . Bravo . My school . You think we just imagined it ? Hallucinations or our eyes lied to us ? What was that ? We have to ask you ! Dunno . We have to ... find our way around . There 's an eye next to this button ! Might be illuminators ? You found ' em once already . Let 's see . The Earth . Now what we did . The Moon . Mommy ! Yes . Space is a cool thing , straight away you start feeleing like a particle of the Universe , like a chromosome or an atom ! Do you really know what you said , eh ? Philosopher ! Look ! They 're saving us already . Maybe aliens ? That 's right , bro ! If they kidnap us , We shouldn 't tell them anything . Yes . Especially about that spot under the bed where you have a strategical storage . Not about this ! Who 's there ? We have to try to open the door . It might not ? Like this . Pull yoourself together ! Well ... Hi , little ones ! I love meeting ancient civillizations ! What ? Hi ! Are you russian ? We thought you were aliens . What are you talking about , little one , you are Russian aliens . And I 'm the translator here , because they don 't dig a word of Russian ! Hey , the little ones , they chatter in Russian . Well , what do you expect ? They 've been living in Russia . I 've been dreaming to learn the language of Tolstoy and Dostoevski . Ok , in short , little ones , So I don 't have to translate all the time and you to wonder how to answer , here . Teaching linguotablets , put ' em under your tongue And in 2 secons you 'll be chattering The Anyland language , just like me . Enjoy your meal . Welcome to our sector . The central one . Let me introduce myself . Boss of reality defence deprtment , General Kubatay ! Commander of security patrol service , Major Ayna . Translator of the contact section of the reality defence department , Captain Smolyanin ! Kostya , namely Konstantin . Stanislav , namely Stas . Excuse me , but how do we let our parents know that we are here . Yes , because they 're worried ! Your parents are gone since a long time . I meant to say that , relating to our time , they are in the distant past . Its 2506 now . And you can say that we are your distant heirs . Stop , stop ! What do you mean ? Our parents are gone now ? Now I will ... You mean , we came here with a time machine ? So we can go back to the past with it ? That 's a secret of universal importance . Boys , you havent eaten for almost 500 years . Yes but ... No " buts " , its already served ! Captain Smolyanin ! - Yes Sir ! Start now . Your attention , please First ... Whats this ? Whats going on ? Whats this mess ? Who is this ? This is Shidlo . He was already threatening to hit our station . Shidlo ? Scrawny cat ! Yes sir , its on line now . What ? In the name of the sphinx civillization we want the kids back in our paws ! Is that an ultimatum ? Hey , don 't wake the the beast in me ! To me , general Kubatay ? Stop it now ! You , Shidlo , are behaving , how to say , provocatively ! What did he say ? He said that ... What ? That about me ? ! Outrageous ! We want to close the time hole , by bringing the kids back to 21st century ! Time travel is forbidden , they will stay here ! Excuse me , are you serious ? Captain , the hand ! - This one ? What are you up to , bastard ? Now I will ... you know what I will do to you ? Smolyanin ! Calm them down ! Take the little ones to the sleep sector . Boys . Don 't be mad at our general , he 's been doing the hardest job for a cenrury now , worse than him is only ... OK . The thing is that if someone goes to the past , the whole world will be gone . Why ? Its enough someone to go back to the past and boom , the whole world will blow up . It will burst like a baloon that was pumped too much . The extra voulume will destroy it . Boys . I know how hard it is for you and you ... look so much like my kids . And I ... Good night . I won 't leave it like this ! Open up ! Major , the department decided To destroy the chronoscaph right away ! But , general ! No " buts " ! Do it ! This is your home , boys , you 'll live here . Here ? There 's everything you need to live happily . This is a macromulti-game-station . Here are gathered the games of all times , nations and civillizations . These are visualizers that connect the thoughts with the virtual world . It 's enough to think of something and it becomes reality . But please , don 't lose your mind playing . Remember who you realy are . So . I have to go . So ? Come on , catch up ! And I was thinking what I have there ! You hear me , Kostya ? Well ... Kostik ! You hear me ? Wake up . Wake up , bro ! I am a pilot ! I am a pilot . What did they do to you ? I am a pil ... Now I will ... Remember , bro ! Come on ! Were are we ? In prison . Forever . And they 're zombifying us . Here . We have to do something . Beore they start again ... Come on . The second one . Who 's here ? Hi , kittens . Shut up , I am Shidlo . Don 't be afaid , I am your friend . Aha , hello . We don 't like the local pals too much . I will help you go back . And how exactly ? She just felt bad about you . Risking her life she disobeyed the department and saved the chronoscaph . With her help I succeeded to get in this space prison . Like this . But well , you aren 't lying ? - Me ? If I lie – I become a dog ! Yes and then ? We , the sphinxes , want to send you back home , to prove to the people that a time loop exists , this way ... Why did you ask him , eh ? ... and we could travel in time . And who are you ? Let 's be friends , eh ? We are from Venus , of course ! this and that , in short ! Ayna is waiting by the gate . But Kubatay might find this out any moment now . Are you ready to fly with me ? Of course yes ! Then leave your dirty things . And to the gate ! Let the adults have a word for a moment . Kitty , come here ! Easy ! Why are you sitting ? Lets go ! Ayna , thank you ! We found out who we are ! This is for your kids . Let them play real games . But be careful , it 's real . That 's it , boys . Hurry up , maybe we 'll meet again . Don 't be bored , kitty . Ok , let 's get out of here ! Shidlo . And what 's going to happen with Ayna ? My brothers the sphinxes Will send her with her kids to Venus today . You see , Ayna always wanted to live among us . And on our planet no dog would ever mess with her ! Kubatay calling Shidlo ! Bring the little ones back now ! The sphinxes wont like this ! No way ! What ? I 'll block you ! I give you 30 seconds ! I 'm sick of it ! So , kittens , let 's time travel ? Are we already in the past ? But this general ... Something 's broken . It has to be fixed . I don 't get it . When we are . You meant " where " . I know where . There 's Earth . But its not clear what time . Ok , we start landing . We 'll see what 's going on there . Let 's go . Where are we anyway ? And what time ? I won 't be surprised If a tyrannosaurus jumps out of somewhere . Like he needs you . Would 've been cool . Can we make a fire ? But we have to get some timber . Take these revive-bracelets . Revive ? - Wear them . They fix any wounds , heal any diseases , resurrect the dead . Look here . It 's easy to use them , so , this thing with the button is a remote , if you pushed it you are alive . All clear ? We are good ? Ok , I will go fix that thing . But take it easy , so your hands don 't get too hot . Ok , your turn . I will ... Yes ... so you keep working and working , you don 't stop and only in such moments you understand , how close you are to nature , the primitive instincts awaken . I would like something ... like this . What ? Different . With our dad , we went often outside the city , made a fire , grilled sausages . Hey , kittens stay here quietly , I 'm coming in a bit . What 's up with him ? His primitive instinct must 've waken up . He answered the call of nature . And here , when is it going to start to ... to wake up . When it 's time . A cat . Big and black one . Female . It didn 't see me . And then ? Well ... - Black one ? That 's a panther . Stop ! It 's a mammal , So there are no tyrannosauruses here . What did you say – a panther ? Yes , a predator from the cat family . Cats huh ? So they have the same chromosomes as ours . And its possible that they 're making sphinx-panthers or panther-sphinxes for us . I doubt it . In your bed ! It 's time for you to sleep ! In the chronoscaph ! No way ! - You sound like Mom ! Here I 'm your Mom and Dad ! And you ? I 'll sit here for a bit ! But she wasn 't bad , interesting . But stupid . Funny . Enough , bro . They are all like that . - What ? No , nothing . We 'll go find food . Some fruit . But don 't go far . And I 'll start doing the repair . Funny ! Yeh , to die laughung ! I don 't really like it . Enough . Come on , bro , there are no tyrannosauruses here . What if the panther appears , or savage people ? - Savage people , there 's only savage nature ! People ! Eh ? Take a break ! There are your people . Check out their spears ! The points are iron , so they aren 't savages . So they are good smiths . Hello , brothers in mind ! You hear ? He speaks Ancient Egyptian . Well ... So we are in Ancient Egypt ? Cool ! Rummage the savages ! We aren 't savages , why are you acting like kids ? Then who are you ? Servants of the dirty Seth ? You are ... Excuse me , we are visitors from the future . We are hmmm , servants of the good god Aziris . I 'm the one on which steps the left sandal of Nemenkhotep IV , when he 's getting off the chariot . Nemenkhotep ? But we know him ! He 's lying in our museum ! Well , who doesn 't know the great pharaoh ! Son of the gods , Nemenkhotep IV . Tie them up tighter . Son of the sun , the earthly incarnation of Chor . Ruler of Lower , Upper and every Egypt , the great pharaoh Nemenkhotep IV . That 's how this museum rag looks like ! Wait , bro , when we go back home I 'll get all the dust out of him . And who are you anyway ? And what do we do with you ? We mmm ... Me and my brother are Aziris ' servants . And you have to let us go . Aziris is waiting for us at the Nile bank . And he 's probably mad already . Aha . And what do my counsellors think ? Oh , pharaoh ! I am Ashiri , your counsellor from the North . Even if the white aliens arent Aziris ' servants , we ought to treat them with honor and let them go ... just to be safe . Oh , pharaoh ! I am Bopa ! Your counsellor from the sunny South . Before you kick these impostors out , you have to whip them in the dark , of course in the name of Aziris . I kind of liked the first version better . We 'll do this : for now we 'll put them in a dungeon , and tomorrow ... In the day of my wedding with the wonderful Haline . We will sacrifice them . Of course in the name of Aziris ! Ok , and whats next on the program ? And now the forecast ! Throughout all Egypt the weather will be marvellous ! Not so much rain at Upper Nile , and at Middle and even Lower Nile , will stay a steady sunny and wonderful time ! With daily temperature of + 30 , and during the night not lower than + 20 . Only to the East , along Red Sea , there might be some North wind . And to the West , closer to Libya , a south wind From Africa will direct towards our enemies . And will throw dust into their eyes ! Finally . It 's all your fault . What is it ? This ! Who took the storage key ? Oh yes ? Now I 'll ... You will what ? This ! Hi , boys . So , you work here ? No , I 'm the Pharaoh 's fiancee . And I decided to take a look at you You are so funny . Ah yes , to die laughing ! Fiancee ! Are you 18 yet ? You think you 'll cheat us ? Why is he like this ? Don 't pay attention to him . Usually he 's normal . Excuse me , but would you help us escape ? Ah yes ? Oh , boys , I 'm not his wife yet . And when I 'll be , you 'll be boiled already . We have to run . If I could ... Nothing . Tomorrow you 'll be the pharaoh 's wife , You 'll have a lot of servants and clothes , treasures and all that ... Shut up ! Do you think I want to get married ? Nemenkhotep ordered to bring all girls to the palace . Looked at me and chose me ! Since then I haven 't seen either Mom or Dad . They burnt them . Why ? Because Dad was a common working man , and Mom , a wife of a common working man . The pharaoh can 't have common relatives . It 's ok , soon I 'll meet them , the pharaoh is very sick and soon will die . And with him to the Kingdom of the Dead will go his servants and of course , his wife . About the Kingdom of the Dead , you are very wrong . Maybe they will heal him ? None of the doctors could , The ones ... that were in Egypt . Were ... And can you have a talk with the pharaoh ? Tell him that in your dream appeared Aziris ! And told you , that we are his servants . And we can heal the pharaoh . Really ? With the help . Of these devices . The special bracelets . Ok I will tell him , but he won 't believe . Then , he will die . Where could they be ? I 'm so sad ! I would like to look . What do you think , will she tell him ? Dunno . You know how the beautiful ones are . And she is really beautiful . There 's one more bridegroom . Ok . My bride saw Aziris in her dream and told her that you can cure me ? She told him . I wanted to sacrifice you , but I can change my mind if ... - We will cure you ! You have to put these bracelets on . After that I will say a special spell and be healthy ! We can even cure a dead man . Ok then . Before you start my cure , you go in the caldron ! You ! And you 'll resurrect him . If it works , you will cure me , if not . We 'll watch you boil after him . You know what ? Take mine too . One of them should work for sure . And you ? What , bro ? Do you remember how I cut my leg , when ... Enough ! Ok , come on . Come on , bro . And what 's this for ? Do you want to eat me ? Not us , the gods will eat you . See , son , this is the gods ' sacrificial caldron . I beg to differ ! Egyptian brothers ! A day will come when you ... Enough ! Enough ! Enough ! What 's there ? Let 's not distract ! My fault , sorry . Let 's forget the past and be friends . I 'm not sure . Excuse my unbelief ! Devoted son of Aziris ! Lets start the cure . The cure is off ! But why ? Just like that ! You insulted these devoted servants of the very Aziris ! You made my brother boil in a soup ! Now you have to dive into the caldron ! Enough nonsense , dear . The spell won 't work then . And how is the spell ? What did they eat there ? - Sweets ... You see . But you don 't want . Now I 'll go into the caldron , and that one has to resurrect me . If he doesn 't do it . With both of them ... I 'll feed the crocodiles . Haline ! Come on ! Take it off ! - What ? The hat . Haline ! I 'm coming to you ! So , I 'll be a priest instead of you ? And you 'll be ... - Of course ! Why did you insult the kid ? Are you talking to me ? Yes , you ! Is this really your business ? Be happy ! People of Egypt ! The bloody tyrant Nemenkhotep is dethroned ! And now the pharaoh function goes to me ! What a joy ! - Is it clear ? ! Catch the traitor ! Kill him ! A typical palace coup ! North , after me ! South , after me ! What 's going on ? The time stopped . Hi . You hear ? Hello , kittens ! I pushed the chronobreak and stopped the time , well ... for some time . And why can we move ? Because we are from another time . And now quick in the chronoscaph , to stop the time energy is wasted and we don 't have much left . Shidlo , we have to take another passenger ! No ! No other passenger . If we don 't take Haline ! Who is that Haline ? The pharaoh 's fiancee , they 'll bury her with that evil old man ! Alive ! Are you serious ? We turn into dogs if we lie . And where 's that Haline of yours ? Right there . Couldn 't you do lower ? Lets go princess . Bye , see you ! See , we meet , boys . And you were saying there 's no Kingdom of the Dead . Quiet . I 'll explain later . But first let me introduce you . Shidlo , this is Haline . Haline , this is Shidlo the sphinx , hello , kitty ! Oh , come on . He 's cool ! I 'm the dumbest cat in the universe . The chronoscaph doesn 't have enough energy to return to the past and close the time loop . Its probably because of me ? Extra load . The energy is enough only to bring you to your time . And what happens if we throw away the extra weight ? Better leave me somewhere on the way . But Haline is right . If we leave her 20 years before our time , then the saved energy will be enough to bring you home , and for me to go back to the past . 20 isn 't that much ! I 'll find you in your time for sure . True . But we 'll have to wait a long time . To you these years will seem just a moment . If you wish , she could find you even today . Ok , lets hurry . We are approaching your time . So ? Where do we land ? Somewhere with mild climate . Some place warm and sunny , like Egypt . Tashkent . That 's right ! You are really good . Farewell , sphinx . Thank you . Ciao , kitten . See you . Bye , Haline . See you today . Actually , I totally forgot that there are all kinds of dangers awaiting you here . In a case of threat , here 's a mummifier . You have to point it towards your enemy and push this button like this and its ready . - Ready ? It 's time ! Hurry up ! Farewell , Haline . We 're here , kittens ! And where 's your house ? Here . Shidlo . A bit to the left . Right here . To stop the time for some time . Farewell , Shidlo . Thank you for everything . You are a real sphinx and friend . Oh come on ! Well , the time loop is closed . I 'm going home . Ciao . Ehh , Shidlo . - What ? This is for you , bro ! To remind you . Bye . Shidlo started the time . Lets go home . Careful not to wake anyone up . Wow , Kostya . Is that me ? - Yes . Shidlo said that we 'll return a bit before our time . We are so stupid ! I wish I could 've caught up and kicked myself . Everything is meant to be , bro . We couldn 't have done other way , it 's fate . Wait , we have to go to the left . What left ? The left left , its shorter like that , come . Kostya ! What are you doing there ? I can 't ever find the reviver remote . Go to bed ! Ok , where have you really been ? Dad ! In the head from the museum , there 's no spaceship , But a chronoscaph , in other words , a time machine . We were in the future , also in the past . In Ancient Egypt . We boiled Nemenkhotep up and met Haline , but had to leave her in Tashkent , because the energy wasn 't enough ! Ok , I knew that the ancient egyptian lessons wouldn 't lead to anything good ! Go to bed ! I 'll call an ambulance . Enough ! Enough teling the truth . What warden ? The head , yes . What ? What do you mean just pebbles ? No ! Don 't call the cops , I 'm coming now . Yes , right away . Get up ! The museum warden called , the capsule is gone . What happened ? That ... Ok , in detail then . Ok , Kostya , begin . So . Like this . Where 's the pharaoh ? Then he flew away . Flew away ? Flew away . In brief , Dad , do you believe us or not ? I do ! but no one else would , even Mom . There 's no proof . If the time machine existed , it 's already gone . There 's the museum and the warden waiting . We 're coming with you ! Usually in such case they say " no " ! OK ! We 'll go through the window ! Not to wake Mom up ! Ivan Stepanovich , what 's going on here ? Who tied you up like this ? I 'll untie you . Hurry , in ! Untie the warden and stay here ! And I will take care of the exhibit ! Not boiled enough ! Thank you , Aziris ! You made me invulnerable ! We have to turn the revivers off ! Kostya , where did you put the remote ? Dad , where did you put that thing you found in our room ? I don 't have time to look for it now ! Dad , can you remember where it is ? He 'll make the pharaoh vulnerable ! I put it in your shirt pocket ! Haline ! Receive ! Galya ? Mom ! I told you That we 'll meet today . Haline ? But you are our Mom ? Dad ! That 's Haline ! I told you that we 'll meet ! Galya !

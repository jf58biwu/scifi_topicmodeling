 MOHINDER : Previously on Heroes . You have to tell me where Mr. Canfield went . He 's not a killer . I 'm not gonna send anybody to Level 5 who doesn 't belong there . You want me to kill your partner ? Do it , and I will let you go . I won 't be a monster . What 's going on ? Claire lied . There was no cheerleading retreat . She 's obviously gone after one of them . SANDRA : Who is he ? MEREDITH : His name 's Eric Doyle . It 's okay , I know him . I 'll go get Claire . This must be my future future . The future has changed . MATT : Her name 's Daphne . I 've got to find her . Are you okay ? ANGELA : Your brothertried to kill me . He took Sylar 's ability , and now he 's suffering the consequences . We 're in a lot of trouble , Nathan . How do you feel about recruiting ? Recruiting for what ? An organization for a new world order . Your father was disappointed that you weren 't born with the genetic code . You did experiments on me and God knows who else . I know a scientist . Anybody can help you , he can . Can he be trusted ? Suresh ? Yeah , he 's harmless . MAYA : You would actually inject yourself with that ? You 're a monster . MOHINDER : I wish you hadn 't said that . ( GASPS ) Hello , Angela . You can see the future . I can 't have that . The team is coming together nicely . We 're building an army just like you ... Whatever you say goes , Mr. Petrelli . MOHINDER : In every journey , the traveler must ask , " Was the right path taken ? " Many roads are long and winding , filled with those who have lost their way . Some forge their own course , guided by faith , seeking not a location , but a kindred soul . Others step together , finding safety in the arms of another . A few remove themselves from the trail to avoid the path of temptation . But those who watch the track too closely fail to see where it led them , and they 're often all too surprised by their destination . Kill the other one . HIRO AND DAPHNE : Kill Ando ? Yeah , he has no powers . What good is he to us ? You kill him , you are badass . That 's good . He 'll never do it . Hiro . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) Hello , Milosh . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Hiro . I 'm sorry , my friend . I must make sacrifices to save the world . ( GROANS ) ( GASPS ) ( GROANS ) Hiro . ( THUDS ) Okay . You 're in . You handle the rest . I 'm taking Adam Monroe to see the boss . Oh , my God ! You actually killed him . That guy told me to . Badass ! That was to prove you wouldn 't . You 're supposed to be a good guy . Now , I 'm a villain like you . Me ? I 'm not a killer . No , but you are a thief . But I just do it for money . It 's not like anybody gets hurt . Well , I want my payday , too . Ando was useless to me . He had no powers . Now , take me to your boss . I 'm not taking you anywhere . You get an assignment like everyone else . Here . You 're going to Africa . He 's a precog . A what ? He can see the future . Whatever he paints comes true . Like Mr. Isaac ? Whatever . My boss can 't have someone like that out there . Bring him to this address . Alive . Just so you know , it 's not easy catching a precog . Why is that ? They see you coming . ( WHOOSHES ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( GASPS ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Hi . Where are you going ? ( SIGHS ) Meredith went after this creep , and it 's my fault . Mom , have you looked at his file ? He 's a psycho . She 's in danger . Okay , I get it . You wanna fight bad guys , save the world , be a hero . I don 't need special abilities like your mother , your other mother , to understand that . Thank you . I really have to go . I 'm ready . Your father always said , " One of us , one of them . " I 'm the " one of us . " Meredith Gordon . As God is my witness I 'm going to make you love me again . It 's like I told you all night long , Eric , I never loved you . You disgust me . You know , even when they stuck me on Level 5 , I knew someday we 'd be together again . I 'd like a destination wedding , like Fiji . Let me go or I 'll kill you . You know how this works , Meredith . You can 't make a move unless I make you move . So I don 't take orders from you . Stop it , Eric . Eric , please . Please . ( GASPS ) You will love me , Meredith . I promise you that . ( GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) You 've heard of me , right ? Adam Monroe ? Guessing you have some sort of special ability . What is it ? I get strong off other people 's fear . I 'm not afraid . ( GRUNTS ) ( CHUCKLES ) Seriously , you 're wasting your time . ( ARTHUR BREATHING HEAVILY ) Arthur ? I heard you were dead . Wait . No . No ! Please let me go . You scared now ? Arthur , no , please ! I can be of use to you ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) Feels good to breathe again . ( MAN CHATTERING ON PA ) That would be a mistake , my dear . Are we not paying you enough money ? No , it 's not that . Hiro Nakamura was a good guy , but we turned him into a murderer . I mean , I 'm in way over my head . Daphne , you and I have discussed this before . I can 't do this any more . Oh , dear . Well , that 's a shame . You 've done so much for us . We 've done so much for you . So much that we couldn 't do for you anymore if you were to leave . Let 's keep this little lapse of judgment to ourselves , shall we ? Look ! There 's your next assignment . MATT : Okay , turtle , you got me home . So now we just need to find Daphne , save her life , get her to fall in love with me . So you just give me a sign . I can 't believe I 'm talking to a turtle . High five , turtle . Daphne ? How do you know who I am ? It 's actually kind of complicated . Lucky guess . Can we go somewhere and talk ? Yeah . Yeah . ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Mohinder , can we come in ? I 'm relieved to see you 're okay , Niki , but , really , you should have called . I 'm in the middle of some sensitive trials here . She 's not Niki . We 're sorry to interrupt you , Dr. Suresh , but we need your help . I 'm Tracy . Niki was my sister . You 're telling me you 're not Niki ? No . Tracy has an ability , too . That 's why we 're here . A doctor did it . Zimmerman ? He altered our genes somehow . A doctor did this to you ? How ? I don 't know , I was just a baby . This is exactly what I 've been researching . How to give people abilities . I was told the same thing was done to me . You 're saying that it is possible . I know it is . Tell me , have you had any side effects ? She didn 't even know about it until four days ago . Let me guess . It first happened when you were in a state of heightened agitation . You were frightened , angry . It came over you like a wave you couldn 't control . Yes . Can you remove it ? I have a feeling we can be of great assistance to each other . DAPHNE : These people know things . Pinehearst ? They know how you struggled as a cop in LA to protect and serve , but that wasn 't enough for you , was it ? No . No , it wasn 't . They know how you 've been waiting your whole life just to be somebody . Sounds to me like you 're not buying your own pitch . No , I am . I just got a lot of appointments today . So are you in or out ? So this isn 't about us ? Us ? Yeah . No . Sorry . Who told you my name ? No one . ( SIGHS ) I had this dream about the future . But it wasn 't a dream , it was real . And you and I were ... We were married . And I know about your speed ability . And we had this beautiful baby girl and this pet turtle , and we 're so happy . We 're soul mates . I came here looking for you and what did I find ? You are waiting for me . I mean , that 's got to mean something , right ? This is getting kind of stalky . So I gotta go . No , no , no . Wait a second . Wait a second . Look , the address is on the card if you 're interested . We named our baby Daniella ... ( WHOOSHES ) After your grandmother . How did you know ... Because I 'm telling you the truth . Look , I have a bunch of stuff to do today , but can you wait here ? Here ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'll be back . Don 't go anywhere . Okay . ( WHOOSHES ) Huh ? This is going to work ? And you 're sure there 's no side effects ? It 's just a marker . Tags any unusual DNA . You won 't feel a thing . Gonna make my job much easier . You know , I always thought my ability was a gift from God , but after what my mother told me , I just ... I need to know the truth . I understand . I once put all my faith in my father 's research . Followed it blindly . I never got anywhere until I thought for myself . Let 's do it . Inside your blood there 's the solution to many problems . And with it , I can help everyone . Something 's wrong . What 's happening to her ? She 'll be all right . ( MOANS ) What have you done to us ? ( WHOOSHES ) ( PANTING ) Who are you ? What are you doing ? My job . I 'm springing you out . You 're Sylar , right ? You have places to be . The guards are here in a few seconds . Let 's get going . No . No ? Who do you work for ? Someone who wants to work with you . Why ? Because you 're a killer . For some reason , you 're important to him . I don 't ask questions like that . Now , come on . I 'm not a killer any more . And you 're not going anywhere . Look , I 'm on your side ! Can 't you see they 're trying to change you in here ? Make you into something that you 're not . You don 't know anything about me ! But the man I work for does . He likes you the way you are . ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) So you know where to find us . We 're going . It 's about time . ( WHOOSHING ) Peter . Peter , you need to come with me . Peter . No , no , no . What are you doing ? I need your help . Get away from me ! No , no , no , no ! I 'm not going to hurt you . You already did . You gave me this hunger . You made me a monster . Now I can 't control it . I 'm just like you . I don 't want to be that any more . I 'm trying to be different . And I think I can control it , and if I can , then so can you . When I saw you in the future , you ... You changed . You found a way to suppress it . How ? I don 't know . But just knowing that I figured it out , just believing it 's a possibility , gives me hope . I don 't want hope , I want it gone . This is not about you and me . I woke you because your mother 's in trouble . Our mother . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Hello , Mr. African Isaac . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) She said she knew him , maybe we just ought to give her a little more time . She 's still not answering her phone . She 's in trouble . Oh , my God , Claire , where did you get that thing ? Dad 's closet . Stay here , I 'm going in . Claire , we should call your father . No , I don 't want him here . ( SOFTLY ) Claire , wait . Claire , if we 're going in there , we need a plan . ( JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CHUCKLES ) I 've always had two left feet . I ... But you were always graceful , and light as a feather . ( CLANKING ) Did you tell anyone you were here ? No . I swear . Good . ( SQUAWKING ) Welcome , nice to see you . Welcome , nice to see you . What do you want ? Hi . Hi , I was wondering if I could book a birthday party for my son , Lyle . He 's six and he just loves puppets . Yeah , I don 't do parties any more . Well , I would be willing to pay cash upfront . Okay , fill this out . Bring it back . Well , I 'll just fill it out here , if you don 't mind . I think I have a pen . Fine . ( RATTLING ) On second thought , I will just take this little form and fill it out at home . Who are you ? ( RATTLING ) ( WHISPERING ) Meredith , come on . Come on , we got to get out of here . Let them go . I said , let them go . ( SIGHS ) No . ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) Those things have just one shot , right ? ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( GRUNTING ) That 's much better . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( GROANS ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( CHATTERING ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( GROANING ) ( SHOVEL CLANKS ) ( MAN CHATTERING ON PA ) ( KNOCKS AT DOOR ) Dr. Suresh ? Maybe . Who are you ? ( WHOOSHES ) How did you just ... You know exactly how I just did that . You know a lot about people like me . That 's why they sent me to you . And what do they want with me ? Access to your research , your database , contacts ... Why on earth would I give them that ? That 's not part of my job description . All I know is that they 've already figured out how to do the thing that you 're trying to do . To give people abilities . They need your help , you need theirs . Help to do what ? Save the world . Look , if you have questions , you can ask them , I 'm just the messenger . ( GROANING ) What was that ? Help us . ( GASPS ) ( NATHAN GROANING ) Great , you 're just as bad as the rest of them . ( WHOOSHING ) ( GROANS ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) It 's show time , ladies . The gun has just one bullet . What is it that you want , you sick ... What I want , Barbie , is not to be interrupted but since you 're so eager , why don 't you spin the gun ? All right , time to choose . Who you gonna shoot ? No . No , I can 't . You 're not scared , are you ? I mean , ' cause you 're the hero with the big old gun . Stop it . Leave her alone . What are you ? Her mother ? Oh , this is too good . You are her mother ? ( CHUCKLES ) So what does that make you Meredith ? I mean , ' cause , you know , you 're too old to be her daughter , too . So let 's see , sexy , free-spirit ... ( GASPS ) Oh , you 're the fun aunt , right ? The one that Barbie really looks up to . Go to hell ! So what 's it gonna be , huh ? PTA mom who tucks you in every night , or cool aunt with flame throwing action . I mean , come on , there 's only one in six chances it will even go off . ( SOBBING ) Please , don 't make me do this . Fine , I 'll choose for you . ( GRUNTING ) Stop it ! Stop ! I promise you I will love you for ever and ever . I don 't believe you . Pull the trigger . No ! If you don 't do it , I will . ( GUN CLICKS ) ( SIGHS ) ( HUFFS ) Okay , mom , your turn to spin . Listen to me , leave them alone . I ... ( GRUNTING ) Oh , you gotta love the irony . I mean , it 's like a Greek tragedy or something , right ? Okay , mom , do it . I won 't . ( WHISPERING ) Yes , you will . Okay , look , these could be your final words , Barbie , so make them count . Mom ... ( SOBBING ) Mom , it 's okay . It 's me . You can 't fight him . Do what you have to do . Pull the trigger . ( SOBBING ) Okay . ( GUN CLICKS ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( GASPS ) ( SANDRA PANTING ) ( SANDRA SOBBING ) ( SIGHS ) That was fun , huh ? ( GRUNTS ) ( THUDS ) Show 's over . ( HEART MONITOR BEEPING ) I found her like this . She 's in some kind of a coma . You 're worried . You actually care about her . She 's my mother , too , Peter . She 's the only person who ever accepted me for what I am . I should have protected her . You 've got to look inside of her head . You 've got to find out what 's wrong . ( GROANS ) What was it ? What did you see ? ( PANTING ) Just this . I 've seen this before . So have I. ( HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING ) ( FIRES ) That ought to keep him down for a little while . It 's a good thing you called me . ( SIGHS ) Claire , you were amazing . No , I wasn 't . I got us caught . No , you saved us . You may have got your genes from me , but you got your heart from your mom . You did this , Claire ? That 's very impressive , sweetheart . Claire ! I 'll talk to her . She just has the wrong idea about me in her head . She 's a young woman now , Noah . She just wants to be on her own . She doesn 't need you or me to protect her . Well , maybe not , but there are a lot more people like Eric Doyle out there . I could use some help . What , from Claire ? No . From you . Peter , don 't . You 're in no condition to go to Pinehearst . They spread abilities , causing the end of the world . They did this to her . I want revenge for what they did to Mom , too . Stop calling her that ! You are not my family . Look , you took from me my ability . I 've lived with it . The need for power will consume you , it will control you . Get out of my way . No . I 'm your brother . You gotta listen to me , Peter . You need help . I don 't need anything from you ! ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) I 'm not gonna let you leave , Peter . I 've been down that path . It 's too dangerous . You 're too weak to stop me . I know what it feels like now , all this power . I 'm the most special . I know what you 're thinking . You didn 't mean for any of this to happen . You try to fix it , but everything you do just makes it worse . It all got out of control . But that girl that was here gave you a way out . Some answers . This was all so unnecessary . Maya was right . I am a monster . TRACY : Maybe we all are . I understand . ( SCREAMS ) Nathan , are you okay ? ( GROANS SOFTLY ) Come here . Okay . We 're not finished here . What , you 're not hungry ? Yeah , me neither . You came back ? Yeah . I 'm supposed to recruit you to Pinehearst , but you wouldn 't fit in . It 's not you . It 's ... I mean , it is you , but ... It 's these people and the things that they do ... They 're not good people , and you seem like a really sweet guy , so ... ( CHUCKLES ) Great . Okay ... Well , that 's ... That 's great . I mean , that means that you and I should ... That means that you need to stay away from them . Actually , you have to stay away from them , too . In the future , Pinehearst is gonna get you killed . That 's why I wanted to find you , to save you , to keep that from happening . You read minds , not the future . I know , I know , but I met a guy in Africa , and everything that he paints ... Comes true . Yes ! So you 've gotta stay with me . No , you don 't get it . I have to go back . I don 't have a choice . But you don 't trust these people . If you can read my thoughts , then you know that I don 't know if I can trust you , either . Forget your thoughts . What is your heart telling you to do ? Same as it always does . Keep moving too fast to get caught . What do they have over you ? I can protect you . No . You can 't . Bye , Parkman . ( WHOOSHES ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( ANDO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( HIRO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) USUTU : Congratulations . You were relying too much on your powers . You forgot how to use your head . But when you started to think , that 's when you found me . This was a test ? Yes . And now you are ready . These are the villains you seek . You can take me to them or you can follow your own path . ( ANDO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Mr. Petrelli ? I know , the bad guys are here . ARTHUR : That 's what they call you , isn 't it ? Criminals , villains ... It 's okay . He 's my son . Dad . Peter . How is this possible ? You 're dead . It 's a long story . So you 're behind all this . You ... You hurt Mom ? Like I say , we need to talk . Come give your father a hug . It 's all right , Peter . It 's all right . ( WHISPERING ) I 'm sorry it had to come to this . ( PETER SCREAMING ) You don 't have your powers any more , Peter . Because I have them now .

 " The Clone Returns Home " Film Partners presents Executive Producer Wim Wenders Co-producers Yuya Sakurai / Toshi Uekusa Producers Kiyoshi Inoue Rie Yamamoto Yoshiaki Tago Written / Directed by Kanji Nakajima Mitsuhiro Oikawa Eri Ishida Hiromi Nagasaku Kyusaku Shimada Toru Shinagawa Mr. Takahara How 's Kanemoto 's condition ? He didn 't make it ? No . Maybe if he 'd been inside the protective stairs but ... He couldn 't take the stress of atmosphere reentry . Takahara . Excuse me . Did you hear ? Just now . Never thought a veteran like him would ... Even with 120 % safety measures , outer orbiter ops accidents rarely occur . Does this mean my number is up ? The next mission might be postponed . In addition to space station ops costs , a new unit will be launched . We 're having enough budget problems ... without this accident . I have to handle the media on this . Investigate the origin of the accident . Yes sir . I 'm Kanemoto Akira 's mother . Where 's the operating room ? This way please . THE CLONE RETURNS HOME To begin with clone technology ... is actually often easily misunderstood . Ultimately , our goals rests in ensuring your life . Our clinical tests are complete . Technologically , cloning is 100 % possible . We 're just waiting for a legal means . We can 't have more victims like Kanemoto . We at the Space Development Society ... have requested cloning help for unforeseen death in the line of duty . But , even with my DNA , you can 't bring the same me to life , right ? We can return you to life just as you sit there now . Mr. Takahara , this isn 't like creating a child from a cell . Ultimately , this is medical treatment for you . We have been reproducing ... damaged organs from patient DNA for transplant for a while . Our technology is simply cutting edge . Even in life threatening accidents ... you can be treated thanks to our body reproduction ... and memory backup . If you desire this " life insurance " ... the data banks lining these walls ... will be filled with your memories . But , doesn 't this seem like I 'm being experimented on ? I know how you feel . " Preparing to duplicate yourself " leaves a bad taste in your mouth . But everything has to start somewhere . For top astronauts like you on the forefront of space exploration ... it 's essential to eliminate all conceivable risks . Of course , the decision lies with you and not me . Please don 't misunderstand us . We are not seeking " eternal life " . Humans must conclude suitable life spans . But ... for people die from unrelated accidents and crimes ... saving them is more humane than treating a lung cancer patient ... who smoked , don 't you think ? I 'll answer all your questions anytime . Please let me know . Chief . Oh , Ko-chan . What 's up ? Calling me Ko-chan like when I was a kid . I was dreaming about when we lived in the country . When Noboru and you were kids . Noboru was such a crybaby . Mother , you never once mixed us up . But we tried to fool you by switching places . Who can fool their own mother ? It was a lovely place . But inconvenient too . A bit of inconvenience is what we all need . Your hair has grown . Cut it . Short hair looks better on you . Kohei . What ? Stay with me a little longer . I 'm still here . I wanted to live in that house again . Grasshoppers come in two colors . - Black-spotted and ... - Any around ? - yellow locusts . - There 's one ! What flower is this ? A chrysanthemum I guess . Hey , fire , fire , fire . Look out . Do like this . What 're you doing ' ? Look . A boat . Take this ... like this . The fold it into three . Here it goes . Grab it bro . Grab it . Noboru . Noboru . Noboru ! Go ! Hurry ! That 's mine ! Give it back . Trapped you ! Trapped you ! Trapped you ! What are you doing , Kohei ? ! I 'm Noboru . Kohei 's the one crying . Silence Kohei ! Don 't cry now . Don 't cry . It doesn 't hurt . Don 't cry . Don 't cry . If he cries , ripen him sweetly Bodhisattvas at the village crossroads please laugh if he cries All better now . You won 't get in until you refill that hole nicely . Think about what you did . Got it ? Mother ! Can I come in ? Mother ! Say you 're sorry . I 'm sorry . Not to me , to Noboru . Sorry Noboru . Come in . Play nicely now . You got in trouble . Nothing to cry about . Now it 's my turn Mommy , Ko-chan cheated What ? Well , time to eat . Oh , Ko-chan , you ate all your carrots . Good boy . Yeah , " good boy " . Huh ? Kohei ? That 's not the " re " note . This is . This is wrong . Line them up . - It broke . - You broke it What now ? You 're in trouble . What should I do ? Don 't touch ! It 's dangerous , Noboru . I 'm Kohei . Noboru didn 't break it . You cheater ! Noboru didn 't break it . Stop it ! I said it was dangerous ! Not again . Some dropped here too . Dry them first . Now it won 't break , right ? It 's hard to do but give it a try . Stop or the fish will hide . Ko-chan , stop there ! Mommy said don 't get too close . Hey , Ko-chan ! I 'm fine . Let me go . It 's freezing . Ko-chan , I said don 't do it . Ko-chan ! Ko-chan ! Mother ! Ko-chan ! Noboru ? Noboru . Mommy , I can eat all my carrots . Mommy , mommy . I 'm Noboru . Kohei is the one who died . Don 't say that ! If I hadn 't gone in the river , Noburu wouldn 't have died . I 'm sorry , sorry , sorry . Sorry Ko-chan . It 's my fault . Sorry Ko-chan . Mommy 's all better . All better now . Sorry Ko-chan . NOBORU 'S NOTEBOOKS You got to live long , enough for Noboru too . I won 't permit you dying before me . Okay ? Let 's go . It 's cold . Noboru ... Noboru ... You okay ? It 's nothing . Just a dream . You 've been tired lately . No wonder you have bad dreams . I 'm fine . Dinner is ready . Tokie . Yes ? Oh , forget it . What 's wrong ? Tell me . Hello ... This is he . Okay . Be right there . Mom 's condition isn 't good . I got to go to the hospital . I 'll go too . Don 't worry . I 'll call if anything happens . We 'll make this work . I appreciate everything . Don 't worry . There are no victims . CHAPTER 2 : THE SECOND KOHEI We have no intentions of offering condolences . Let me see my husband 's remains . The accident occurred outside the Earth 's atmosphere . Please try and understand . He 's not your tool to play with . Dead or ... resurrected to life ? Don 't play with him because you can . If ... my husband is really dead then ... his soul should 've gone back to his dead mother 's side . Your husband ... by his own will , in the case of death in the line of duty ... chose to be restored as a clone . Don 't you think he probably did it for your family 's future ? With the intention of telling you at some future date . I can 't consent to this . To your selfish will . Why was I left out and have to consent to this impossible situation ? I understand your confusion . But your husband will return to you just as he was . Then you can hear the whole story directly from him . Coming back as a clone ? How do we know if he 's my ... husband or not ? I 'd imagine that you 'd know better than us . Please calm down and sign the forms . No . I don 't trust you . Then I will have to offer our condolences . Is that what you want ? The test results are normal . Two days have passed but still no consciousness . Try sensory stimulants ? Too great a risk . If his memory malfunctions , we 'll lose everything . But ... Let 's observe him a while . You should take a break . Mr. Kohei Takahara ... How do you feel ? I didn 't break it . Noboru did . Kohei ... it 's me . You know me , right ? Mr. Kohei Takahara . Do you remember anything at all ? Relax and tell us please . Noboru is ... Noboru is gone . Noboru was ... washed down river . He 's fine . Just temporary memory confusion . You 're fine . Don 't worry . Mother ? I want to ... go home . Noboru . You 're ok . It 's over . Try sedatives . Please stop ! Mrs. Takahara , please calm down . This is too cruel . Bringing back a memory he tried so hard to forget is ... too much ! This man has suffered enough . All of you ... are too cruel . Leave my meal over there . It 's been a while , Doctor . What is it ? I 'd like your cooperation . Too late for that . Get out . Doctor , you 're the one who wants out of here , right ? It 's not a bad trade-off . Or should I leave you ? Finally we have a legal subject that answers all requirements . If this succeeds as the world 's first legal human clone ... he 'll probably be the biotech Gagarin . Gagarin wasn 't the first in space . The records of those who didn 't make it back were erased . He succeeded so he 's said to be first . I see . So like Gagarin ... here 's a chance to clear your name . That 's how you see it , eh ? Let 's be brief , Doc . Your illegally recreated your dead granddaughter before . Your high tech had no memory malfunctions . Why was that ? You rip the brain 's memories and ... love arranging them like a jigsaw puzzle but ... human memory isn 't that simple . If bad memories they tried to forget are dug up ... memory regression is unavoidable . If you know so much , provide the memory control data program now . In exchange , I 'll take responsibility in ending your confinement . Fine by you ? I 've got one condition . Cooperation should be enough - I know the deal . You 'll get the data . I want to know what lies beyond . Let me meet the clone after regeneration . Want to check something . Resonance ? What is resonance ? What echoes ? If a dead person ... learns they 're still alive in this life ... can they reach Nirvana ? What on God 's Earth are you on about ? Extracting the memory and exposing of the corpse ... won 't erase the scars on the soul . The soul with no place to go ... draws near the clone and ... haunts him like a guardian spirit . Ridiculous ! Enough of the occult hypotheses - You plundered my granddaughter and ... murdered her with your tinkering ! Stop bringing up that same story ! Her death was accidental . Besides , what you did was illegal and ... isn 't considered a death matter . You made an error by not considering the soul 's resonance . If she 'd lived , I 'd have solved the enigma of resonance ! What 've you learned while I 've been your prisoner ? How pathetic . You only consider science to be toying with cells and machines . Cloning is beyond the realm of current technology . Why can 't you see that ? Noboru . Mommy ... Noboru 's ... If he cries , ripen him sweetly Bodhisattvas at the village crossroads please laugh if he cries Sleep fast in the moonless night Don 't let the mountain Lord take him Hey . What ? Where 'd you come from ? Anyway ... put this on . You 'll catch a cold . Th ... Thanks . Are you a foreigner ? With that baggage and outfit ... just where are you headed ? Home ... going home . Hello . I think he wandered from a hospital . No , a mental hospital . Nothing like that ... No , he doesn 't seem dangerous to others . No , he won 't hurt anyone . You better come back . Hey ! Gone ? Word has gotten out . Activate the recovery unit . Hurry . A civilian called the police . I 'll take care of it . " Medication " finished ? I made so no evidence remains . Understood . Is the spare body set ? All set . But Chief ... I ... Don 't sweat it . This isn 't murder . The second clone will be a success . If we succeed , think how many precious lives can be saved . Think it over . Understood . Hey ! How 'd you get in here ? No trespassing ! Get out ! That 's ... mine ! Leave ! No dumping ! Get out ! I 'm throwing this out . We 're ... almost home . We can see mother . Noboru . Dying alone was scary I bet . Sorry . If I hadn 't gone in that river ... ONE MONTH LATER , KOHEI # 3 Mr. Kohei Takahara . Do you know who I am ? Chief ... Where ... am I ? In a room at the cloning lab . You remember requesting clone regeneration , right ? Yes ... I remember . You had an accident in space and have been treated - It 's too soon . Take time so not to confuse him . Did I ... die ? Tokie . Sorry ... to have worried you . Never thought this would occur so soon . I ... don 't understand . I don 't trust anything anymore . Even you . Thought you 'd be against it . But ... I must keep on living . Welcome home . I 'm home . Tokie ... how 'd mother make out ? Now complete " life insurance " has been established . Clone tech can contribute to society opening many roads . That 's it from the press conference . The legality of it bothers me . The ethics of these scientists weren 't viewed as a problem . As for medical treatment ... we can 't ignore the contributions to patient care ... from clone tech . Sure , these exist but ... " life management " crosses ethical lines . More than stirring up public empathy , debate and research are needed . This crazy law is moving ahead alone . That very meaning was stressed at the conference . As for how much clone tech has contributed to patient care ... No clones ! No clones ! I 'd like to talk to you a bit . Fine . I could use the distraction . Outside seems crazy The public is easily excited and quelled . My memory is still saved up in here , right ? Sure but ... If so , I 'd like to talk with my other self in here . Was I ... wrong about something ? What do you want ? As one of the researcher here , I want to ... check something . I 've taken all your test . Still more ? Since being cloned , is there anything unexplainable around you ? Haven 't you experienced any unfathomable phenomenon ? Interesting question , eh ? But unfortunately , nothing . I knew it . Resonance can 't happen to you . What 's this " resonance " ? The effect of the original soul on the clone . I want to verify my hypothesis that ... the clone is a spirit connecting life and death . But , why didn 't resonance happen to me ? You were reproduced not as the second but as the third . I was what ? The second test case only lived a few days after waking up . Now , he 's MIA . No way . Your test case , number 2 of you ... had a strong reaction to his childhood memories . You 're probably the only one who knows where he disappeared to . I want to know the truth behind his strong resonance . Not again . Can your hear that sound too ? Lately , I hear that all the time . I doubt my ears aren 't working . You can hear it too , right ? Hey , I knew I 'd seen you before . So you 're okay ? Did you forget me ? You stopped at my house the last time you passed by . Remember ? You had the big scarecrow . Well ... You acted strange and had me worried . But today you 're looking well . That wasn 't me . Actually ... that was my twin . Why 's ... this here ? K. TAKAHARA Why ... did this ... happen again ? Mother ! Executive Producer Wim Wenders Written / Directed by Kanji Nakajima

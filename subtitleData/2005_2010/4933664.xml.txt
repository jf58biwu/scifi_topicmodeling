 After 3,000 years , the doorway to your people can be opened again . And what then ? Invasion ? The Gorgons need us to survive , Miss Smith . Opening the portal to their world isn 't opening the door to invasion , but salvation . What have you done to my dad ? Pay heed to the Gorgon 's warning and don 't interfere . Dad ? Mother Abbess ? He can 't be . He can 't . I didn 't mean to shout at you , Dad . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Listen to me , Maria . You are not going to lose it . You are not going to fall apart . Understand me ? Whatever happened to your father , there 's one thing I 've learned in all these years . There is always a chance . Do you hear me ? Mum was right . I shouldn 't have had anything to do with you . It 's all your fault ! I wish I 'd never seen that alien in your garden ! I wish I 'd never seen you ! Everything was fine till we moved here ! Everything was fine ! I know , Maria , I know . But we have to try . We have to try to put things right . What 's happening , Luke ? Is Sarah Jane really going to give that Gorgon thing the talisman ? No ! If the Gorgon only wanted to go home , why was Mrs Nelson-Stanley so scared of the nuns finding it ? Mum 'll find a way of tricking them . Are you sure of that ? I mean , what if she doesn 't ? She 's my mum . She wouldn 't let us down . She 'll get us out of this . All the same , we should be looking for a way of escaping , not catching up on our reading . It 's the history of the abbey . Originally , it was a private house , built in the 16th century . Banging ( ! ) It was during the Reformation , when priests were being hunted . Look , I can get a history lesson any time I want , off Mrs Pittman . Houses were built with escape rooms and secret passages . Houses like this one . My scan indicates Mr Jackson has undergone massive molecular transmutation . We know that . He 's been turned to stone . Not stone . Not strictly speaking . It 's an organic petrification process . Like fossilisation ? It is comparable . And , to correct you again , Sarah Jane , Mr Jackson hasn 't turned but is turning . The process isn 't complete ? Could it be reversed ? Theoretically . What does that mean ? It can be done . The molecular transmutation isn 't yet stable . But I don 't know how to do it . Well , you 've got to work it out ! You 've got to save my dad ! I 'm not sure there is sufficient time . My scan suggests molecular stabilisation will be complete in approximately 90 minutes . There must be something you can do . I can only be realistic . And to be candid , things look worse for you all the time . Please , Mr Smith ! You 've got to help us ! Perhaps if I were more familiar with the Gorgon ... Bea ! She might know something ! She might . But Bea has Alzheimer 's . Her mind is trapped in the past . That 's where she met the Gorgon ! We 've only got till four o 'clock . Like I said , there 's always a chance . Let 's get going . I 'm telling you , I 'd rather take my chances with the Gorgon than make like a mole through any more tunnels . Whoa ! Couldn 't they get garden gnomes like everyone else ? It 's killed all these people , then put them on show like trophies . Or a warning , and I 'm taking it . Let 's go ! I 'll have to leave you here on your own . I really wish I could help you , Maria , but I have to find Luke and Clyde . Everything Bea knows about the Gorgon is still inside her head . You just have to find a way to unlock it . You were right . I never should have got any of you involved . I 'm sorry about what I said . It 's not your fault . I wanted to see aliens . Who wouldn 't ? If there 's a way of saving your dad , Maria , I know you 're going to do it . We have the key . Rejoice , Sisters ! The Gorgons shall be free ! Mother Abbess ! She is weakening . We must open the portal as soon as possible . Now , while the coast is clear ! I can 't . What you talking about ? I promised Mrs Nelson-Stanley I wouldn 't let them take the talisman . I 've let her down . Did she tell you you 'd be going up against a Gorgon and you might end up a garden ornament ? No , but ... This goes way beyond the call of duty . Mum wouldn 't give them the talisman unless something had happened . What ? That thing ? Sarah Jane and Maria ? I 'm not going to let the Gorgon win . But I need your help . KNOCK ON DOOR Come in . Bea ? Hello , it 's Maria . Do you remember me ? Hello , darling . You 're a little young , aren 't you ? Young ? To be the curator of the Museum of Egyptology . Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Behold ... the key to the portal . After 3,000 years , our work here comes to an end and our world is on the threshold of a new age . The Gorgon world is 100 million light years away , and the angle of ascension must be aligned perfectly . Transdimensional occlusion is forming . Alignment is at 20 per cent . Only an hour before the portal opens and your people shall join you . After all these centuries , Gorgons shall have their promised land . The time grows short . The host is dying . We need to find a new carrier before the portal opens . Bea ? Bea , please help me . MUSIC PLAYS ON RECORD PLAYER You have to tell me about the Gorgon . Edgar and I danced to this in the palace ... In the palace of the Sultan of Ishkanbah . Do you know him ? No . I 've never even heard of ... Bea , the Gorgon has turned my dad into stone , and if you don 't help me , I 'll never get him back . Understand ? The Sultan was a fascinating man . He had seen the Yeti , you know ? Tell me . Tell me about the things you 've seen . I 've seen all kinds of things with Sarah Jane . Do I know Sarah Jane ? It 's silly , I know , but I keep forgetting . Sarah Jane has seen loads of aliens and monsters on Earth , even other planets . She 's had hundreds of adventures , just like you and Edgar did . Edgar ... If only I could hear his voice again , just once . We had adventures once . Such adventures ! But no-one believes me now . No-one listens to you when you 're old . I believe you , Bea ! Bea ! DOORBELL RINGS Maria ? Are you in there ? Alan ? The woman 's obsessed ! She really is a bunny boiler , this one . Couldn 't have the real thing , so she 's made herself a statue ! I bet you 'd be flattered if you knew , wouldn 't you ? You didn 't know , did you ? So it 's come to this , has it ? Talking to a flaming statue instead of the real thing . Maybe her and me aren 't so different . Both have to make do with what we can . Difference is , she doesn 't know what she 's missing , does she ? Still , you 're all right . Anyone can see that . You and Maria get along great . Better off without me around messing things up . Well , like I said , I can make do till I mess things up again , which ... I will , cos I 'm me , aren 't I ? Anyway , er , been nice talking to you . Alignment is at 45 per cent . Good . Her strength is failing . Soon we will select a new host . Soon the Gorgons and humanity will be one . All right , Quasimodo , time to do your thing . BELL CLANGS LOUDLY What on earth ... ? Find out what 's going on ! Stop him ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Have you got it ? There 's loads of them ! They 're everywhere ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Boys , quick ! This way ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! I bet your lipstick thing would have had this licked , no problem . Shame the nuns made me check my bag in at the door . I hope Maria 's having better luck with Mrs Nelson-Stanley . We don 't need any Star Trek gadgets . This place is full of secret passages . Luke read all about it . He 's got it all filed in that superbrain of his . I don 't remember any down here . Yeah , well , all the same , it 's worth trying . Mum . Hm ? I think the Gorgon 's dying . Why ? We saw her stumble earlier , like she was sick . I heard Sister Helena saying they needed to find a new host . She said when the portal 's open , humanity and the Gorgon will be one . That 's what she meant ! At the house , when she took the talisman , Helena said the Gorgons needed us to survive . I don 't think the Abbess is the Gorgon . What ? Miss Smith , will you come with us ? I 'll be fine . Don 't worry , boys , we won 't harm a hair on her head . We 've got to find a way out of here . Sarah Jane was right , wasn 't she ? I thought meeting creatures from other planets was exciting and cool . But she told me . She said it wasn 't anything like that . In the end , it just messes you up , your whole life and the people you love . That 's why Sarah Jane 's always been on her own . That 's why you 're here , isn 't it , Bea ? With no-one in the world who really knows you , or cares . This is how we all end up , isn 't it ? I had my Edgar . You are young , you 'll find yours . Bea ? Are you really there ? Where else would I be ? I haven 't got much time . The Gorgon turned my father to stone . Can we save him ? Your father ? Oh , dear . Oh , deary-dear . That 's most unpleasant . I should know , it happened to me . It turned you into stone ? The nuns were after the talisman . But Edgar saved you . He must have . How ? The talisman . It is the key to the door between this world and theirs . But it 's more . It returned me to flesh and blood . The talisman . The Gorgon 's got it . Then you must get it back . Not only for your father , but for every soul on Earth ! Thank you , Bea . Not so fast , young lady . Would you ... er ... fetch me ... my mirror ? No , not for me ! So I can powder my nose while you take on that monster ? It 's for you ! For me ? Whatever do they teach you What makes you think the Gorgons will still want to invade ? 3,000 years is a long time . Not for the Gorgons . Without host bodies to carry them ? The Gorgons are parasites , aren 't they ? " Parasite " ... It 's such an unattractive word . It 's what they are , a life-form that lives on another , that depends on another to feed and survive . The Gorgon gives its host life beyond human years . The Abbess has carried the Gorgon for 200 years , although there have been many hosts , and now she grows weak . Her time is coming , and the Gorgons have chosen a new host to lead its domination of Earth . You , Miss Smith . You 're going to dig a tunnel ? No . I 'm going to make a screwdriver . The old-fashioned way . Not long now , Miss Smith . As the Abbess weakens more , the Gorgon will release its hold on her and you will become leader of a new race ruling planet Earth . You can do what you want to me , but this planet will never bow down to that THING . We need a plan . Yeah , sure . When we get a chance , we 'll figure one out . Meantime , we need to find Sarah Jane . The portal is opening . The Gorgons are coming . The new Queen must be ready to meet them . Bring the host forward . Don 't struggle , Miss Smith . Embrace your destiny ! The Gorgon is controlling all of you ! You 've got to fight it ! If not , they 'll destroy the human race . No ! The Gorgons shall save us ! From war , from greed . We will exist only to serve them . We will be at peace everlasting . And you shall be our Queen ! To receive the Gorgon , do not look into its eyes , Miss Smith . To do so will turn you to stone . I 'd rather be a lump of granite than bow down to that thing ! You don 't have a choice , Miss Smith . Prepare to serve the Gorgon ! NUNS : Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Serve the Gorgon ! Mum ! Luke ! Hold them . They can witness the transfer and be the new Queen 's first prey . No ! No ! Where am I ? What 's going on ? You 're free . The Gorgon 's lost its control over you . They 're coming through ! Come on , Maria ! What about your father ? Come on ! What if it doesn 't work ? If it saved Bea , it 'll save your father . Quick ! Dad ! He 's alive . He 's just unconscious . Quickly , we have to get him out of here before he comes round . Where the heck have you been ? I 've been looking for you for ages ! I went looking for Maria , then I must have sat down in Sarah Jane 's garden and dozed off . Another of the disappearing Jacksons ! I 'm sorry about earlier . No , Dad , I 'm really sorry , I shouldn 't have yelled or run off like that . It was stupid . I could have lost you for ever . You 're never going to lose me . Do you know what that woman has in her lounge ? It 's shocking . What ? A statue of Dad . A statue of me ? But why ? Because she 's a nutter . Mum , there isn 't a statue . There is ! What , er , what exactly was it you were looking for , Mrs Jackson ? What have you done with it ? It was right here , bold as you like , a statue of my Alan . Mrs Jackson , I don 't know what you 're ... I know what I saw . Where is it ? Er , I have no idea what you 're talking about . Come on , Mum . Maybe we should go home , hmm ? Pity , really . I think I 'd look good as one of those Greek statues . I prefer you the way you are . Oh , sorry I couldn 't stay , love , but Ivan was in floods on the phone . It 's OK . I understand . I know we 're not under the same roof , darling , but ... I 'm always there for you if you need me . I 'll always be here for you . OK ? Always . I wasn 't seeing things , y 'know . I know what I saw over there . Listen to your mum . Stay away from that Mary Jane . There 's something not quite right about her . Meter 's running . Mum 's back with Ivan . So it 's just me and Dad again . If the talisman was the key to the portal , how could it turn my dad back ? All matter has an atomic default . Some alien technology uses this default to turn things on and off . Such technology can reverse cellular distortion . It can make things the way they used to be ? Most fortunately for you . So maybe it could help Bea . Oh , Maria , I don 't know . Bea has Alzheimer 's . Besides , she had the talisman all that time . Luke said it was in a tin box . Maybe she hasn 't touched it for years . Oh , I don 't know , Maria . But she helped save my dad . If it could change him back from stone ... Please , we have to try . BEA HUMS TO HERSELF Hello , Bea . It 's Maria . I 've got something that belongs to you . Is it my compact ? I 'm always leaving it lying about . Edgar says I 'll lose my head one of these days . No . It 's something Edgar gave you . Oh , no , you must put it back where I hid it . You must put it back in case they come ... It 's all right . They 'll never come looking for it again . The Gorgon is dead . Everything is going to be all right . Is it true ? Edgar gave it to me , you know . I know . But he 's been gone for so long . I 've always been scared to wear this . Oh , it 's so beautiful . You know , he put this round my neck and he kissed me for the first time and told me that he loved me . MAN 'S VOICE WHISPERS : 'I will always love you , Bea . ' Oh ... Edgar . Thank you for bringing him back to me . You shouldn 't be upset . The talisman didn 't cure Bea , but it did something amazing all the same . It gave her peace . She was lucky to have Edgar , wasn 't she ? I suppose she was . Don 't you wish you had found someone special to share it all with ? Oh , I think I have . For the second time . Now , let 's get back . The Viszeran Royal Fleet are passing through the solar system tonight , all 600 ships . Only takes a few seconds , but it is the most magnificent stellar light show this side of the galaxy . Have all these kids really gone missing ? We run a special competition for the more skilled competitors . This is wicked . It 's like Premier League for laser tag . Are you man enough to have a go ? Soon we shall have the children you need . 24 children have disappeared in cities where there 's a Combat 3000 . The ultimate warrior of the future is always on guard for a surprise attack . Perhaps I can help . Goodbye , Miss Smith . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

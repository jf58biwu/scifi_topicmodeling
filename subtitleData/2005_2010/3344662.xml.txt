 I 'm not gonna let you manipulate me . I 'm the one making the decisions . Mr. Petrelli . You 're playing yourself ? I 'm obviously playing Mr.- - She can 't see me , Nathan . No one can . Except you . You 're different . You 're special . My name is Daphne , and why are you two following me ? I want my father 's formula back . There 's supposed to be some sort of exchange going down at this theater . And I 'm waiting to intercept . You were right . I am just a killer . I guess you were wrong about me . We 'll see . You wanna tell me that 's not you ? It 's not me . You can 't run this story . Hey ! Oh ! My name is Tracy Strauss . Do you know me ? Know you ? I created you . I came to find you . Get you outta here . I need to show you . The whole world is in trouble . Reflexes , blood pressure , balance . They 're all normal . I am completely the same in every way . Just different . My god . This is Dr. Mohinder Suresh , journal entry 12 . Three days after injecting the genetic modification formula . My reflexes are sharper . My strength , off the charts . It 's a dream come true . Who among us hasn 't wished for strength ? To fly ? And now it 's all possible . There are few adverse reactions . The one exception being an unusual rash . A byproduct of the formula , an allergy- - Oh , no , please don 't ! Stop it ! Hello , is everything all right ? I 'm sorry to intrude , but I heard shouting and I wanted to make sure ... - ... everything was- - - Everything 's fine . Thanks . Are you sure ? 'cause it looks like your wife- - She 'll be fine . Now back off , Sahib . Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop , please . Just leave us alone , all right ? God , don 't hurt him . You were one of three identical triplets . Tracy , Niki , and Barbara . Perfect test subjects . When your birth parents died we separated you . We- - I just need some answers . What did you do to me ? Dna manipulation . A formula that would make you incredible . Speed , strength . Is it something like that ? Why ? Why would you do this ? What gave you the right ? We had no right . We were arrogant and selfish and human . Who ? Who wanted this ? I think I 've said too much already . They would not like that . Give me a name . Someone ! There was a company . A company that- - Um , I don 't remember . I can 't remember . You 're lying . They made us forget . Well , then you have to take it away . This ... Thing that I can do . I can 't . No , you don 't understand . This ability ... I 've hurt people . It is part of you now . No , I never asked for it . You need to take it away . I can 't . Tell me how to take it away . Ah ! Tell me . I 'm so sorry . What have you done ? Who is she ? What happened to her ? It 's your future , Parkman . Not mine . Yeah , it is , okay . So that means I can stop that from happening , right ? Do you really want to know ? This stuff is supposed to show me my future ? Ugh . I don 't think this is working . Here . Try this . Come on . Where are we ? When are we ? This is the future I came back to stop . Why ? It looks just like today . With one big difference . How is this possible ? An injection . Abilities are available to anyone . For sale if you can afford it . For grabs if you 're desperate enough . Now all these people with abilities are gonna destroy the world . How could you know that ? How would you ? I painted it . Dreamed it . It 's going to happen- - here , look . All the crime , murder , all abilities . People can 't be trusted . We 're weak , jealous , violent . There 's always good people , always . How could I be so naive ? When abilities are the new weapon of choice- - People will control themselves . It 's not safe for me to be out in the open . They 'll be looking for us . I needed you to see . Who are " they " ? What did you do ? They think I 'm an extremist . A villain . I had to stop it . Maybe they 're right . You shot Nathan . You killed him . He was gonna tell everyone the truth about us . But he didn 't die . And now he doesn 't have to . So why hasn 't everything changed ? Someone from your time is putting together a formula that gives people abilities . You have to stop him . Why me ? Why can 't you do it ? Because I made terrible choices . Stepped on too many butterflies . What does that mean ? You can 't make the same mistakes as me . We need to find Sylar . With his ability , you won 't make the same mistakes . Sylar , what the hell are you talking about ? I wanna see Nathan , Claire , Suresh . They 're not the people you think they are . Why not ? Not all of us were born with abilities , okay ? Some of us were made . A line was drawn . Sides were chosen . It tore us apart . Claire ? Well , you actually did it . You killed Peter . No . He 's still alive . Looks plenty dead to me . There were two of them . This one and a younger one from the past . This is bad , right ? Bad-bad . Yeah , we have orders . Kill Petrelli . It 's obviously easier said than done . We need to use Molly . She can find Peter anywhere in the world . You know I can 't just do that . It 's not that simple . It is . If you won 't ask her , I will . I 'm not afraid of you . No , but you are afraid of Peter . And you know he won 't stop , not ever . Until we find him ... and we kill him . Let me out ! I must save the world ! The future depends on it ! Senator Petrelli ? Senator , you need to make your choice . There are a lotta historical desks available . Where 's Tracy ? Isn 't it her job to make these decisions ? Well , Ms. Strauss isn 't answering her cell . Take the john foster dulles . It sends the right message . Which one would you pick ? Uh , Robert Kennedy 's . Kennedy it is , thank you . You know , I thought you 'd be enjoying this . You 're a senator back in the seat of power where you belong . Able to do god 's work here on Earth . God 's work ? I 'm picking out desks . What 's the real problem here , Nathan ? You . You 're the real problem . Y-You don 't trust me ? I 'm hurt . I 'm the only one who can see you . That 's a problem . Don 't play me , okay ? I 've been around people who can do amazing things . What are you ? What , are you a telepath ? No . Nothing that obvious . You know what it is ? It 's brain damage from the shooting . The shooting that you so miraculously survived . Come on , Nathan . I mean , healing , flying . I mean , isn 't that the work of angels ? You saying you 're an angel ? You 're a murderer . You wanted to destroy New York city . Kill millions of people . If I remember correctly , you did too . What exactly do you want from me ? I want to help you . First , a senator . Then president . President . The greater the fall , the grander the ascension . Isn 't that what you 've always wanted ? Trust me . This is the path to salvation . It 's not my path . Not if you 're leading the way . This place is disgusting . The milk 's gone bad . Didn 't you notice ? Look , I don 't need you cleaning up after me . Well , obviously you do . You don 't look well . I 'm just tired . No wonder . Working all hours . No food , no fresh air . I have lots to do . Come on , let 's get outta here . I can 't . But it 's a beautiful day outside . And you 've been cooped up in here- - Working for you . Trying to find some way to take away your ability ! Isn 't that what you want ? I came because I care about you . You want me to go ? Fine . Wait . I-I-I didn 't mean to yell . I-I 'm just tired . I will find the answers for you . I promise . Journal entry 13 . The rash is spreading . I don 't know what it is or its connection to my aggression . The formula is transforming me , and I fear ... I fear what I 'm becoming . The formula is transforming me . I fear what I 'm becoming . The formula is transforming me , and I fear ... I fear what I 'm becoming . Mohinder ? What do you want ? I need your help . I need you to tell me everything you know about Sylar . Sylar ? I have to find him . He 's supposed to ... help me . But why ? Why Sylar ? Mohinder , are you okay ? What happened to you ? What 's going on ? Mohinder ! Do not repeat my mistakes . What happened to you ? I wanted abilities . Impetuous . Selfish . I got the formula wrong . So wrong . Let me help you . Tell me about Sylar . Sylar 's power is dangerous . You don 't understand it . I need to understand . Where is he ? Where 's Sylar ? Costa Verde , the Bennet house . Don 't go ! Hey , uncle Peter . Dad 's making waffles . What 's up , champ ? How you doing , man ? Good to see you . Who wants some waffles , huh ? Who else should get some waffles ? Mr. Muggles . Okay , a little piece of waffle . But just ' cause you 're such a good boy . Yes , you 're so good . Always such a good dog . Yes , you 're a very good doggy . Peter , it 's so good to see you . I haven 't seen you in so long . If you told me you were coming , I would 've made extra . What 's the magic word ? Abracadabra . Well , that 's a magic word , so that 's close enough . Where 's your scar , uncle Peter ? You know what ? Grown-ups need to have a little chat in the other room . So I 'm gonna get you started on your waffle . All right , there you go . You gonna be okay ? Yes . Yes , I know you are . We 're just gonna be in the other room , all right ? You 're not from around here , are you ? No scar . The past , right ? Which means , to you , I 'm the boogeyman . It 's a hell of a thing . You coming here to find out that you and I are brothers . Brothers ? Oh , I 'm sorry that you 've come all this way , Peter , but I can 't help you . Can 't ? I won 't . Why ? I 'm not gonna give it to you , my ability , I 'm not . Then I 'll just take what I need from you . As if you could . Peter is dead . They killed him . And now they 're after me . I am not leaving without your ability , Sylar . My name is Gabriel . And you don 't realize ... my ability is not just understanding how things work . There 's a hunger that comes with it . To know more , to have more . I couldn 't control it . It had turned me into a killer . A monster . Every day is a struggle . Every hour . But I fight it for him . And I am not ... going to willingly condemn you to hell . If I have your ability- - If I can understand the variables , then I- - can save the world . The world always needs saving , Peter . You 're all gonna die . Your family . Your son . This world is gonna end . You don 't believe me ? Here . Paint it . See for yourself . Paint the future . Don 't let him see me . Not like this . Do you understand ? No , no way . No , we 're not dragging Molly into this . What ? Well , we 're both raising her . Yes , to be a normal little girl . Not to be your bloodhound . No , it 's just this once . We use her ability to find Peter . Peter Petrelli is a murderer and a terrorist and- - and he 's the villain , not me . This is our chance to stop Peter now . Forever . I just--I- - I don 't understand why you would risk your life when you 've got this beautiful baby girl waiting for you at home . You are beautiful . This is everything to me . You , this family- - And this is the part where the " but " comes in , Daniella . But I was a cop . And I know what it 's like to have a spouse who 's worried if you 're ever gonna come home alive . I 'm gonna be fine . Nothing can touch me . Right . You 're a wife and a mother . It 's time for you to slow down . We find Peter . We catch him and then you can consider me settled . You 're not gonna let this go , are you ? And miss a chance to stop Peter and all the pain and misery he 's caused ? We have to . Molly . You guys done arguing ? Uh , we--we weren 't- - Your mother needs to talk to you for a second . Everything 's gonna be fine . Peter 's in Costa Verde . Sylar . Sylar , yeah . You 're afraid . Don 't act like I don 't know what I 'm talking about . You stink of it . So what if I am ? So Claire Bennet isn 't afraid of anything . I just killed my uncle and I have to do it again . Give me a second to be a human being . You see , the problem is , Claire , unlike you , Daphne and I can die . So get your head on straight . Sylar ? It 's a scar . A reminder of what I was . Of what I can be . Fix it . I don 't know a thing about watches . If you wanna learn how to access my ability , fix the watch . Listen to it . Like a symphony , every piece has its part . All coming together in perfect harmony . If you can understand the complexities of a watch , you can understand anything . Everything . Cause , effect , action , reaction . How to change the future . You have it now . I 'm so sorry . Daddy ! Not now , Noah . Yes , now . Noah , stay where you are , buddy . Noah . It 's gonna be okay , buddy . Let 's not make this any harder than it already is , Peter . Just come quietly , and we 'll leave them alone . Don 't do it , Peter . Teleport out now . I 'm not leaving you . I brought this into your house . No . This was my house . You took everything from me . Claire , I never meant for you- - Shut up . What 's it gonna be ? The boy or you ? You don 't want anyone to get hurt , do you ? Just , first , let the boy go . Not until you 're dead . You 're gonna kill me ? One bullet in the back of the head should do the trick . Then I 'll let the boy go . I 'm not the guy that you killed this morning , Claire . Look , this is me . You 're not gonna kill me . Yes , I am . What happened to you ? How 'd you get this way ? I learned how to take care of myself . Noah ! Daddy ! Go hide over there . Go now . I understand your power . You get stronger with fear . I 'm not afraid of you . But he is . Noah , run ! Run ! Daddy ! They killed him ! Gabriel ! Metropolitan police department . Detective Russick , please . This is detective Russick . Are you the detective working the Jim Mccann case ? Yes , I am . I have some information ... about him . Who is this ? I- - I- - Hello ? I killed him . Damn it . Journal entry 16 . I cannot reverse the process . Cannot remove the ability . Not from Maya . Not from myself . It 's a part of me now . Yes ? You stuck your nose where it didn 't belong . So did you . And the glory forever and ever . Amen . Please , show me my path . You picked the Kennedy desk . Good choice . You 're back . Did you find what you were looking for ? My resignation . I know I dragged you into this . And I 'm sorry . I just can 't do this anymore . Nothing I can say to change your mind ? No . I know what I have to do now . You must pray for guidance . This is your path . You 're just gonna have to trust me , Nathan . You must help her . Drink ? Yeah . You okay ? No . So , uh ... You can fly ? I can 't believe this is happening . I have to show you something . Your hands aren 't even cold . Costa Verde is gone . The single greatest tragedy in American history . The first lady and I mourn this tremendous loss . We urge all of you to find your families . Find your loved ones . And that we pray together as a family . And as a nation . Are you trying to teleport ? That 's not gonna work with my friend here . 200,000 people died in Costa Verde . I want you to feel the pain of every single death . That 's one . I can save them . Everyone in Costa Verde . This whole world ... doesn 't have to be like this , Claire . You don 't have to be like this . I saved you once , I can save you again . No . That 's two . Stop . I 'd like a moment with my brother alone . Is this the president or my father speaking ? Both . I know what you 're doing . I 've seen it . The world splitting in half . I 'm not ignorant . I 've seen the paintings . And I 've heard the dreams . I know what 's going on . You 're strong , Pete . But one man cannot save the world . It 's everybody 's responsibility . Everybody with abilities . An army with abilities . Congress has agreed to full proliferation ... because of Costa Verde . Because of you . Now , I know you think people can 't be trusted . That we 're all greedy . Power hungry . But we were created in god 's image , Pete . There is a goodness to man . You don 't trust me ? You 've been manipulated before by Linderman . You were gonna blow up New York city . You can read minds . Read mine . Peter ? I understand ... Your intentions . Your emotions . You believe that you 're doing the right thing , but you 're wrong . Peter , stop . It hurts . I need- - I need- - I need to- - I need to ... Understand . I need to- - Your intentions . Mr. President ! Mr. President , are you all right ? Peter . What are you doing ? I went to the future . The world ended . I took your ability so I could understand how to stop it . You took my ability ? You have the hunger . You 're like me . I will never let myself become you . You already are brother . This was the scene above Costa Verde just hours ago . Everything within four miles has been completely incinerated . The sky is dark with smoke and debris . We can only imagine how massive ... It 's my fault . I told her to go to Costa Verde . Daniella needs her bottle . Come on . But I- - Go take care of your sister . Now . i ... . danger of radiation poisoning . Any search for survivors is going to take time . But it 's hard to imagine anyone still alive in there . The army and national guard are only now beginning to assess the extent of the destruction . Daphne . I wasn 't fast enough . No . No . No , no , no , no . Come on . Come on , you 'll be fine . You 're gonna be just fine . Welcome back . What happened to me ? I was in the future . - Did I time travel ? - No . You never left . You were asleep . - Dreaming . - Dreaming ? No , no , no . No , it was real . It was . I was there . She was there . Everybody had abilities . The bomb . The baby . It was real . It was real . Her name 's Daphne . I gotta find her . It 's a big world . Lots of people . You sent me on this journey . Come on . You must find your totem . A spirit guide that attaches to your subconscious . It will lead you on your journey . What is that , some African , mystical , mojo thing ? Carl Jung . Analytical psychology . You don 't read much , do you ? All right . What is this totem supposed to look like anyway ? Usually an animal . Think about your dream ... and you 'll find your guide . Where is Kaito 's part of the formula ? What 's so important about this formula ? It can turn people like you into people like us . And that will lead to disaster . So the formula is gone . Stolen . There were two parts to that formula . They have both and we have lost . Your father loved you dearly , Hiro . He had faith you would grow up to be a great man . But he was mistaken . And his folly will be the downfall of us all . I am sorry . No , you 're not . I 'm not ? Don 't apologize to her . This is Hiro Nakamura . He will not rest until that formula is safe . What he said . Someone is manipulating us . Someone powerful . Hidden . And they must be stopped . I will find them and stop them . Actually , you 're the only one who can . You have the key to unlocking this entire mystery . I do ? Hiro , you son of a- -

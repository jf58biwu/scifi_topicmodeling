And another hero goes back in time to rescue her . I 'll just go back ... I 'll stop her from coming to work . Peter solves the mystery of his destiny ... The cheerleader . I think we 're all trying to help her . ... and a father was stopping nothing to avert catastrophy . This girl , the one you 've painted here , she 's my daughter . This man here ... he 's gonna kill her tomorrow night at her homecoming game . I need you to paint this painting . Tonight , their destinies will unite them , to save the cheerleader and save the world . Chapter Nine - Homecoming We are , if anything , creatures of habit ... Drawn to the safety and comfort of the familiar . So do they actually believe that pudding is a vegetable ? But what happens when the familiar becomes unsafe ? When the fear that we have been desperately trying to avoid finds us where we live ? - Something wrong ? - Jackie just killed my appetite . Oh , look , the principal 's gonna post the homecoming queen announcement . Whoopee . Well , aren 't you gonna go see if you won ? - What 's the point ? - You 're a finalist , Claire . Go . Good luck . Kinda nervy for someone in your position to be running for homecoming queen . My position ? You know . Pariah ? You hospitalized the MVP , annihilating any hope of us actually winning the game . You 're not deluded enough to think you 're actually gonna win ? No delusions . It 's a popularity contest , and you 've made it very clear that I am no longer popular . It 's more than a popularity contest . Being selected homecoming queen is about serving your school . God , Claire . I didn 't think you were that shallow . Congratulations , ladies . Make me proud . Oh , my God , - don 't spaz out . - What ? I can 't believe it . I won ? Claire ! Claire ! Claire ! Shut up , you freaks ! Claire ! Claire ! Claire ! You didn 't tell Peter about me buying this painting , did you ? You asked me not to . I don 't get it . What is it ? It 's one of a series , the work of Isaac Mendez , a rising artist . Peter believes Isaac can paint the future . Is it supposed to be Peter ? I 'm not sure . But Peter thinks he needs to be there to save a cheerleader . - Union Wells High School . - Yeah . Peter thinks if he saves a cheerleader ... he 'll save the world . Right . - Is that the only copy ? - Yeah . Why ? Peter 's got all these ... ideas in his head . Delusions of grandeur . He thinks he 's supposed to make a difference . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? No ! No ! No ! Saving his life . What ? You believe it ? Save the cheerleader , save the world ? - I 'm not sure what to believe anymore . - I am . Nice ! What 's the range on this ? The Kinsella 320Z , been known to pierce body armor at 400 yards . - Military grade . - That 'll work . Don 't want to see his eyes , huh ? - Must really hate the guy . - You have no idea . He took my son . Damn . - You call the cops ? - Cops can 't stop him . but I can as long as he doesn 't see it coming . - How much ? - Two large . We 're going hunting . So how long do you plan on keeping this up ? Till you turn around . I told you , we can 't go back ! And I told you Mom needs me . It 's not safe with her . Look ... I still love her . No matter what she does , a part of me always will . But your mom has changed . The good news is that it 's gonna be you and me from here on out . Partners . - You mean , like Batman and Robin ? - Yeah . Like Batman and Robin . Only ... I ain 't wearing no tights . You could wear tights . I 'm not wearing tights . - Need to hit the head ? - Nah , I 'm good . Micah ! Did you ever consider that these dreams that you 've been having , - are just that , dreams ? - It 's impossible . They were talking about my sister Shanti , a sister I never knew I had ! As children , we absorb powerful archetypes that we bury in our subconscious . Your parents were obviously still grieving over your sister . - Freud would tell you the same thing . - What about the boy ? - The one with the soccer ball ? - Yes , how do you explain his picture being hidden in my father 's desk , huh ? He was one of them , right here in Chennai . Sanjog Iyer , my father identified the genetic marker . It says the boy can enter your dreams , alter your perceptions , uh , kind of spirit guide . - You must have seen that file before . - I have never seen this file before , and I have had thousands of dreams in my life . These were different , they were ... they were real . We have to find this boy . Hey , what was so important you had me meet you over here ? That painting you wanted , Nathan bought it from Linderman , - had it shipped here . - It 's here ... Can I see it ? There . I-I don 't understand . He said it was to protect you , that you 're gonna get yourself killed . Okay , wait a minute . You saw this painting , all right . - You can describe it to me . - You really believe this , don 't you ? Save the cheerleader , save the world . For reasons I can 't begin to understand ... There are people that are counting on me to do this . I don 't know if I can , but I have to try . This doesn 't make any sense . I probably shouldn 't be showing you this . It 's a digital image , it came with the painting . Is that you , Peter ? I ... I don 't know . Maybe . If it 's you , then you 're gonna die at 8 : 12 tonight . - Don 't go , Peter . - I have to . I have to . Union Wells High School is in Odessa , Texas . I took the liberty and made a phone call . Homecoming is tonight . Thank you . Thank you . Look , I don 't know if this is gonna happen . - Just come back , okay ? - I will . Hiro ? Hiro ! Hi , this is Peter Petrelli , is this Hiro Nakamura ? - No . Ah , he will be right back . - Who is this ? - I 'm his friend , Ando . - Ando , right . Okay , this is very important . You and Hiro need to get to Odessa , Texas , as soon as you can ... Union Wells High School . Okay , that 's where the cheerleader is . We are in Texas already . Midland , at the Burnt Toast Caf√© . - It 's outside the airport . - You are ? That 's great ! Listen , I 'm gonna get on a flight , tell Hiro that I 'll be there before he knows it . Yes , okay . I will tell him . Good-bye , Peter Petrelli . It 's gonna be okay , honey . It 's useless . How is that supposed to help me find Sylar ? He 's not a vending machine . You can 't just put the drugs in , pull a lever , and expect a clear response . I mean , he 's a person . Your emotions are impairing your judgment . Maybe , but I 'm not the only one . When he wakes up , have him paint another . No . You think I 'm being emotional ? Do you have any idea what we 're up against ? Come here . Oh , my God . Sylar wants to do that to my Claire . I will do whatever I have to do to stop it . Isaac can 't help us . It was a mistake to do that to him . Go to the high school . Use the paintings as a guide . Wait for Sylar . You 'll have help . When the time is right , neutralize him . - I 'll keep Claire safe at home . - No , it 's homecoming . Find Sylar , take him out . And let me worry about Claire . - Congratulations , Claire . - Thanks so much ! I don 't know that girl . - Holla to the queen ! - Holla back ! Everybody who wasn 't my friend is now my friend , and everybody who was my friend , isn 't . Well , it 's not a popularity contest , it 's an unpopularity contest 'cause you rocked the freak vote . I what ? Look , everybody who 's like Jackie voted for Jackie , and everybody who isn 't voted for you . And in this school , the unpopular vastly outnumber the popular . Made for a good campaign strategy . You campaigned for me ? Why ? You think all this school spirit stuff is stupid . I never said it was stupid . I said it 's beneath you . But obviously it 's important , so whatever . Now you have a little piece of your old life back , okay ? Just don 't start acting like a bitch again . Look , I got this off of the Internet . It supposedly has this really big chapter on spontaneous regeneration , so I thought it might enlighten you on the whole Miracle-Gro of it all . - What 's with you ? - You 're being so nice . I 've never been this nice to you . I mean , I 've been nice , but I could be nicer . Then why don 't you ? Congratulations , Claire . Mmm , is the gay boy your date ? You should tell him , only one of you gets to wear the tiara . What ? That is so unfair ! - Hon ? - I 've already made up my mind . You are being completely unreasonable . Do you have any idea what it means for me to miss this game ? - You 'll survive . - But Dad ! No , you listen , and you listen good . As long as you live under my roof , you will do as I say . You may not agree , but don 't think for a moment that that matters . You are not leaving this house tonight . Is that clear ? Crystal . She 's gonna hate you for a long time on this one . Let 's hope so . Micah ! Micah ! What were you thinking ? Do you know how scared I was ? Now you know how it felt when you left us ! Micah , what am I supposed to do here ? Go back ! She needs us ! We 've discussed this . - Your mom ... - Dad , I know she 's different , okay ? I see it too . Something happened to her when you left . It got really bad . - Then , sometimes , she 'd show up instead of Mom . - She ? Jessica . Jessica . Dad , Mom ... Mom 's sick . She can 't help herself . She can 't control it . Micah . Does your mom know about Jessica ? No , I don 't think so . Dad , we can 't just leave her . If you still love her , you 'll help her . You 're right . Do you know this boy ? You 're wasting my afternoon because of a ridiculous dream . No one said you had to come . And who 's gonna keep you from getting killed ? This is a dangerous neighborhood . One look at your fancy shoes and we 'll both be running for our lives . - Have you seen this boy ? - Come now , Mohinder . Let 's stop this nonsense . Go back to the university , talk about this like rational people . - I am not leaving until I find him . - I know this boy . For 500 rupees , I can tell you where he is . This man is a crook , give him nothing . - What are you doing ? - Where ? You came to me in my dream last night . I don 't come to anyone . - They come to me . - Why ? Why do they come to you ? They have questions that need answers . I 'm not sure that I have a question . Yes , you do . I have two paths in front of me . I need to know which one to take . Which one is my destiny . You already have the answer you seek . What is it ? What 's my answer ? Hiro . Excuse me . When was this picture taken ? Oh , that was Charlie 's birthday . About six months ago . - Do you know him ? - Hiro ? Sure . He and Charlie were tight . Please , where is he now ? I have no idea , darlin ' . He popped out of her life weeks ago . Zach ? What r u doing ? Throwing rocks at ur window . Open up ! What 's going on ? I 'm here to rescue you . - Let 's go . - I 'm grounded . No one grounds the queen , come on . Yeah , tell that to my dad . You only get to be homecoming queen once . You know what ? You 've already cemented your victory in the eyes of the student body by punching Jackie . Plus , if you back out now , she becomes the queen . My dad would pitch a fit . So , big deal . What ? He grounds you more . He double grounds you . Come on , you deserve this . I do deserve this . And tonight , you can be my date to the dance . - Me ? - Sure , why not ? Uh ... For a million different reasons . Is it about what Jackie said ? - Because I don 't care ... - I don 't care about that , you think I care about that ? She can call me whatever she wants . I 'm not gonna be embarrassed by it . I know who I am . I like who I am . I like who you are . I just ... I just wish that you liked who you are . I 'm finally realizing who my friends really are . And that maybe being different isn 't the end of the world . That 's just who I am . Exactly , you gotta embrace your inner freak . Because the only thing that you 'll regret is denying who you really are . Ando ? Hey , I 'm Peter Petrelli . How are you ? So sorry it took forever . I-I couldn 't get a flight , and then taxis in this town ... We still have time . Where 's ... where 's Hiro ? Hiro traveled back in time to rescue Charlie . I told him it wasn 't a good idea , Peter Petrelli might call , but he insisted . - What happened to her ? - She was killed . We were sitting right here . It happened so fast . Next thing we know , she was dead and the killer was gone in a flash . Like , Okage . Uh ... boogeyman . Hiro says maybe it is the same man that is going to attack the cheerleader . I told Hiro do over , is too risky . But Hiro says man who is too afraid to use power , does not deserve to have power . I know when , and I know where the cheerleader gets attacked . I have to stop him . - Is this you ? - Maybe . - You have a power , right ? - Sort of . Super strength ? You bend time and space like Hiro ! No , I ... I kind of absorb the abilities of others . - But only when they 're close . - Hmm ? Truthfully , when I 'm by myself , I don 't ... I 'm not really anything . I 've got less than an hour . Okay , it happens at 8 : 12 , I have to go . Coming ? No . I will wait for Hiro . Without him , I 'm not really anything either . - Maybe you should wait too . - There 's no time . - I have to save the cheerleader . - But , Peter ! You die . - Where is she ? She 's gone ! - Oh , right . I saw her and Zach skip out across the lawn ten minutes ago . She must have climbed out her window . Why didn 't you try to stop her ? Because she 's a good girl , and she deserves this . You are being way too harsh . You don 't know what you 've done . If you hear from her , call me immediately ! You 're wasting your time . Freud would tell you the boy is merely a manifestation of your subconscious . Nirad ? Haven 't we already had this conversation ? No , wait ! You 're wasting your time . Freud would tell you that the boy 's merely a manifestation of your subconscious . It was more than a dream , it was real . This boy can give me the answers I seek . I 'm your friend , Chandra , but you sound like a madman . Well , all great thinkers were said to be madmen in their time ... Darwin , Einstein , Gandhi . Darwin was not ridiculed by his university 's biology round table . - They weren 't even listening . - You 're the one who 's not listening ! You think you 're actually gonna find these people ? Levitation , spontaneous regeneration ? Chandra , I know that Shanti 's death drove you to find answers , but it is time to let go . If you persist on espousing this insanity in your writing and in your classroom , they will strip you of your tenure . So be it . I just finished reading . It 's fantastic , Father . To think that today , all around us , the evolutionary process continues so dramatically ! Who told you to read this ? No one , I saw it on your desk , so I picked it up . You invaded my privacy , Mohinder . This was not for you to read . Well , I 'm sorry , but I think it 's extraordinary , and I want to help . By using the Human Genome Project , we can locate these people . Not " we " ! You can 't be part of this . - Why not ? - Because I don 't want you to be ! I don 't understand . Darwin said a scientific man ought to have no wishes , no affections , a heart of stone . That 's me , Mohinder . It 's not you . Go home . You have your answer . You were trying to protect me . Heart of stone . Why did you have a heart of stone ? Heart of stone . Heart of stone . My sister . You found them . - Ooh , sorry ! - Sorry . That was my fault . I wasn 't looking where I was going . Hey , do you ... know this girl , Jackie Wilcox ? Uh , yeah , half-time show starts in about five minutes . She 'll be out on the field . She 's a cheerleader . - Are you a reporter or something ? - Alumni . I 'm just curious . You know , between you and me , she 's not that special . Just your average teenage girl . She rushed into a fire and saved a man 's life , sounds kinda special to me . Yeah , you 're right . I 'm jealous . She 's our town hero . Me ? I don 't win too many popularity contests . Hey , it gets better ! - What ? - Life after high school . It gets a lot better . Half-time , girls ! Come on , pump it up ! Whoo ! Will the nerviness never cease . I thought you were grounded . It didn 't take . How 's your eye ? Nothing I can 't cover up . There 's something I wanna say to you , cocaptain to cocaptain . Say it . I think you 're a menace . And I 'm not just talking about you punching me over your boyfriend , the girlfriend . I 'm talking about you in general . We used to be BFF 's . What happened ? Maybe I 've gained some perspective . I 'm tired of trying to be someone I 'm not . Well , you 've been trying to be me since second grade . And now you 're trying to be me . How do you figure ? Your little heroic act of pulling the guy out of the burning train car ... wasn 't your heroic act , it was mine . No , it wasn 't . I have it on tape . You know , a good friend of mine once said it 's more important to be honest with yourself and happy than popular . I think he got it right . Really ? Sounds like a loser to me . Public schools suck . - Did you hear that ? - Hear what ? Hello ? Stop it , you 're freaking me out ! - I thought I heard something . - You 're imagining it . Let 's go ! - What is your problem ? - Don 't go that way . What the hell ? - Jackie , something 's not right . - No , duh ! We 're missing the coronation . Believe me , if you don 't want to go out there and get that homecoming crown , - I 'm more than happy ... - Aah ! No ! No ! No ! Aah ! Claire ! Aah ! Aah ! Run . Are you okay ? Run ! Go ! Keep going ! Run ! Oh , my God . Claire . Hey , hey , hey ! Run ! Run ! - Who is it ? - Go , to the stadium , okay ? Find people , find lights . He doesn 't want to be seen . - What about you ? - Don 't worry about me . Just go ! Go ! No ... You ... How did you ... Where is he ? I don 't know . He ran away before I got here . Police . Go get some help , okay ? Okay . I 'll be back . Hey . What 's your name ? Peter . I 'm Claire . Are you the one ? By saving you , did I save the world ? I don 't know . I 'm just a cheerleader . Claire ! Dad . Dad . It 's okay . You 're okay . Dad , it was terrible , Jackie , she ... I know , I know . We have to go back . We ... we have to go back , - Peter ... - No , no , no . - He saved my life ! - No , no , no , he 'll be fine . But we can 't leave him . We can 't leave him . He almost died , but then he ... He ... We have to go back ! We have to go back ! The police 'll take care of everything . Look at you . You 're lucky to be alive . It 's not luck , Dad . I have something I have to tell you . You don 't want to hurt me . We just need to talk . You can tell me all about yourself . But first , go to sleep . You need to sleep . That 's the guy ! He 's the one in the overcoat the janitor saw . - Put your hands on your head ! - What the hell ? - Look at all that blood . - It 's not what you think , guys ! - All right , hands up . - What are you do ... It 's not me ! - He 's getting away ! - Let 's go ! Stand up ! Mira called . She said you turned down her job offer . You 're going back to New York ? He did it , you know . He discovered them . His theory , it was right . And that is good news , yes ? Why didn 't he tell me ? We wanted you to live your own life . So now that you know about them , what will you do ? Find them . Tell them who they are , if they don 't already know . Warn them of the dangers they face . And who will protect you ? Next stop , Vegas . Dad , we don 't need to go back to Vegas . Why not ? I called Mom . I told her where we are . She 's on her way . Micah , get in the car . Now , come on ! Dad , what 's wrong ? We are all , at our cores , the sum of our fears . To embrace destiny , we must , inevitably , face those fears and conquer them . Whether they come from the familiar ... or the unknown . My name is Hiro Nakamura ! I 'm here to save your life ! Hey , Charlie ! Charlie ! Come over and blow out the candles ! Hold that thought , okay ? I gotta go make a wish . Thanks to Raceman for the Transcript Subtitles Made By The Bloc Team

Oren K. Blunderers ! Fools ! We possess power greater than any on earth yet our conquests are stripped from us on every front ! Our most dangerous enemy is not G.I. Joe but your collective incompetence ! Hogwash ! What do you dare say ? The fault , most imperial Serpentor , lies not within us , but within you ! Your leadership has been pompous , pusillanimous , and pathetic ! What did he say ? He 's gone batty ! That 's treason ! I don 't believe it ! Yes , leadership is at the very heart of this matter . But it is not mine that is inadequate , Cobra Commander , it is yours . Your ego-driven stupidity had converted victory to catastrophe for the last time ! Go ahead . Make me the scapegoat . My loyal subordinates could testify to my superb stewardship of Cobra , but you don 't have the courage to let them speak . Wrong again ! Defend him , if you can . Indeed they shall . You first , noble Destro . Militarily speaking , it is only fair to say that Cobra Commander is a world class ... buffoon . What ? Baroness ! Doctor Mindbender ! Brave Xamot and Tomax ! You won 't let this treacherous assassination of my character go unchallenged , will you ? Certainly not . Destro forgot to mention your frequent displays of cowardice . ash ! Hogw ! And you botched our desert campaign ! We had won , but you countermanded my order ! Your meddling brought us defeat , again and again and again ! You 're not just a fool you 're Cobra 's curse ! Inept ! Insufficient ! Inexcusable ! Unsubstantiated fantasy ! Lies ! Lies ! LIES ! Intruder alert , sector 45A . Battle stations ! There ! Stop him ! Look ! Security has been breached ! This may be an assassination attempt . Serpentor must stay here . We will intercept the intruder . I will meet this intruder at arms ! No ! We must protect you ! Without you , there is no Cobra ! Yes . Yes , if something happened to Serpentor , it would be tragic , wouldn 't it ? We shall stop this assassin . Come , follow me . Cobra ! come on men lets move on No , not this way , that way ! Intruder approaching Serpentor 's war room . Seal all sectors ! None may challenge Serpentor . This I command ! That won 't be necessary . I , I have seen ... I have seen you before , in a dream , a vision . In a memory , O great Serpentor . I am part of your destiny . When you were created , my face was etched into your soul . I am Pythona , and now it is time to fulfill your destiny . Behold , the Broadcast Energy Transmitter . So I say to the guy , " I don 't care if I have to drive all night , we 're gonna be there by morning ! " That 's funny ! Catchy tune , isn 't it guys ? One more time ! He can 't hear you , Mainframe . Well , Dial-Tone , they 're gonna here about the Broadcast Energy Transmitter all over the world . Pure energy , pumped through the air . Yeah , unlimited power , anywhere , anytime we want . If it works . The B.E.T. ' ll work perfectly , Duke . I can practically feel its little semiconductors singing under my fingertips . Hey , hey , be careful . Well , let 's find out if we 've wasted a billion taxpayer dollars . Here we go . If this thing works , it could be the key to the world 's energy crisis . It 's working ! All right ! Hey ! The B.E.T. started Cross-Country 's HAVOC ! I 'll shut down and see if it stops . Whoa , mule ! Stop ! Stop ! STOP ! Go , go , go ! It 's ... Cobra ! Destroy everything , except the Broadcast Energy Transmitter ! This I command ! Snow Job , need a lift ? Maybe walking 's better for my health ! Since when are you the nervous type ? Yo Joe ! They 're after the B.E.T. Fall back and regroup for counterattack . Press forward ! I must possess the Broadcast Energy Transmitter ! This I command ! This operation is costing us dearly ! I hope your contraption is worth it . That is not your concern . Do as you 're told like an obedient lackey . Lackey ? You dare call me a ... Auggh ! Mindbender , look out , you dolt ! What the hell is that ? Cover me ! The B.E.T. ' s our only shot ! Yo Joe ! Dreadnoks , cut him down ! Man with a problem , Quick Kick ! What are friends for ? Tomax ! The B.E.T. is activating the Joe 's weapons ! Treachery ! We 're being attacked from behind ! Stand your ground ! Not there , here ! No , over there ! The emperor needs us , Commander . When I so order , Baroness . Farewell , worm ! Serpentor is hurt ! We must save him ! Cobr ... No ! retreat ! Cobra , retreat ! What coward called retreat ? Serpentor needs us ! We can 't ... We have a counter-attack to deal with . Retreat to the mountains ! I know where we can find sanctuary . Cobra 's through what do we do ? Ah , I hate it , but we 've gotta split the force . Roadblock , form a unit to run down Cobra . The rest of us will take care of Serpentor and the B.E.T. You heard the man . Let 's wreck us some reptile . Yo Joe ! etc . This is madness ! Our men are half frozen ! You 'll kill us all ! Head for that pass up ahead . We 'll find sanctuary on the other side . There they are ! Yeah ! Yo Joe ! etc . Blast ! The Joes have caught up ! 'Ey ! We didn 't sign up for nothin ' fatal ! Caw , mates , me eyes are playin ' tricks ! 'Ey , gov 'nor , what 's this all mean ? We are safe , safe ! Yo Joe ! Take refuge in the grove ! Knock ' em out ! What is this , the Twilight Zone ? Forget them redwood toadstools ! It 's battle time ! Yo Joe ! Roadblock ! Back off , fast ! Gotcha now , you slippery creep ! Bravo , bravo , dear friends ! He knows these people ? You were as impressive as ever ! You struck me ? Golobulus will have your head for this ! It is not his head you should be worried about , Cobra Commander . Pythona ! You will all come with me now . No ! NO ! Nemesis Enforcer , fetch Cobra Commander . No ! Release me ! I order you to let me go ! Where are you takin ' the others ? You will find out soon enough , Dreadnok Ripper . You know us ? We know everything . We know that Serpentor has been captured by G. I. Joe , and you must rescue him . Ride the Joes ? Are you balmy ? We don 't know who you are or where you come from or even what side you 're on . Why should we risk our necks on your behalf ? Does this answer your question ? A gem of that size answers ... all my questions . Twenty-four hours , and zip from Roadblock and his unit ! They 're smart and tough . No reason to write ' em off yet . Agreed , but who 's gonna take their place if Cobra hits us now ? We 've got the B.E.T. and Serpentor , General Hawk . The Fang Gang 's bound to take a whack at ' em . And we 'll need all the Joes we can get to whack back . What if I lead a search party after Roadblock 's unit ? Okay . Find ' em and bring ' em back . I 'll have the B.E.T. transferred to a maximum security station while you 're away . Yo Joe ! Sir , I 've already ordered Beach Head to fast-forward the training of our new recruits . The sooner they graduate , the sooner they can fight . That 's easier said than done . First they 've got to survive Beach Head . Attention ! I want a stone-cold , righteous attention ! Your chin is down ! Your chest out ! Your gut in ! Your face mean ! 'Cause you are rough , tough , fightin ' machines ! Thank you . It 's a real pleasure to see that one o you 's a real trooper . De nada , man . Let 's look sharp , eh , compadres ? That better , sweetheart ? Don 't you call me sweetheart . You six Rawhides , you 're gonna learn soldiering ' , and ... hey , there 's only five of you . Where is that gold-plated goof-off , Lieutenant Falcon ? Terrific question . Man said he had some errands to do . Go to the tailor , wallpaper his footlocker , weird stuff . I think he had a date or somethin Atten-hut ! Now , I 'm gonna see what you Rawhides are really made of ! You two Rawhides 'll love this little training exercise . All you gotta do is get from here to there and ring that bell . But watch out for surprises . Big deal . I got kicked outta kindergartens with tougher playgrounds than this . Cut the macho , Tunnel Rat ! Now do it ! All right ! Big Lob makes his move ! Big Lob goes for the gold ! Whoa ! He cuts cross-court , sidestepping the opposition . He executes a perfect ten dive ! The goal line is in sight ! He breaks free near the end zone ! Takes out the defense and lays down the long bomb ! It 's lookin ' good ! Rim shot ! Will it drop in ? Yes ! The Big Lob scores , and the crowd goes bananas ! The crowd ain 't the only thing that 's goin ' bananas ! Front and center , Law ! Somewhere in this village is a time bomb set to go off in five minutes . Find it and dispose of it . No problem , Beach Head . What 's that bow-wow doin ' here ? This is my dog , Order . He 's trained to sniff out explosives . Order , seek . This is supposed to be your test , Law ! Eh , Law Order is a team , man . He finds the bombs , I drive the car . We tried it the other way , but it didn 't work . C 'mere , boy ! But he 's bringin ' the bomb back ! Get outta here ! Gimme that ! Ahh ! Let go , ya dumb dog ! Order , give it to me . Good fella . Get rid o ' that thing ! He thought you were playing , Beach Head . He 's usually quite obedient . I hope you BOTH get fleas ! All right , Chuckles , the object o ' this exercise is simple . Draw a bead on that HISS and blow it to kingdom come . Chuckles , wake up ! You gotta get it before it gets you ! Hey ! What are you doin ' ? Next time , Chuckles , use the rocket launcher . Jinx , why aren 't you dueling Lieutenant Falcon ? He didn 't show . Guess he was too chicken to take me on . Either that or he heard you 're one bad-luck lady . Who says so ? Everybody . The word is when you 're around , things go wrong . Yeah , well , they usually turn out right in the end . What in blue blazes are you doin ' ? Sparring . Any problem with that ? Yeah . Your eyes . Keep ' em open ! But I ... Mouth closed , eyes open ! Yes , sir ! And don 't call me sir ! Hmph . Pathetic . Don 't bother to unpack . You ain 't staying ' here long . Care to try it again , my way ? As my blind ninja master used to say , the keenest eye is that which looks inward . See what I mean ? Are you sure it 's safe ? Why , just thinkin ' about Serpentor bein ' locked up in here gives me goosebumps all over my body . Don 't worry about it , Heather . When you 're lucky enough to have Lieutenant Falcon for a guide , you have nothing to fear but ... Falcon himself . Don 't try spooking ' me , Falcon I 'm scared enough as it is . C 'mon . You can relax with me . Now , you see those tech manuals over there ? Now just suppose those were Cobra creeps . Look out ! Ooh , do it again Falcon , please . Watch this : over my shoulder . Duke ! What are you doing here ? My duty , which is more than you seem able to do . Didn 't it occur to you that a military prison was no place for a date ? I thought you said you were in charge . A camera ? You let her bring a camera in here ? I 'm taking that film . I , I didn 't know . Mellow out . She didn 't take any pictures . Film AND visitors are forbidden here , Lieutenant Falcon . You 're supposed to be aware of those regulations ! I 'll take the lady elsewhere , SIR ! C 'mon , babe , this is starting to get BORING . I 'll show you boring , mister ! Jinx , escort this young lady off the base , .on the double ! Right , Duke . Let 's go , Goldilocks . I had a wonderful time , Falcon ! That Falcon is such a hunk ! I 'm talkin ' major league gorgeous . But I 'm not tellin ' you anything you don 't already know , am I ? As a matter of fact , I did have kind of a date with Falcon , but I doubt he 's gonna have much time for socializing with either of us from here on . Now make like an amoeba and split . Toodleoo ! You 're dangerously close to insubordination , mister ! And you 're over the line on military protocol ! I 'm an officer and I 'm pullin ' rank ! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE ! The only thing you 're pulling is guard duty until I say otherwise ! Takin ' a dip , love ? Zarana ! I didn 't know it was you ! Neatly done , sister . I trust your mission was equally well executed ? Duke took the film in my camera , but not in my earrings . We 'll soon know everything we need to penetrate the Joes ' stockade . Blimey ! It 's a bloomin ' sea monster ! Excellent , Zarana . You have done well . We shall use your information to free my lord Serpentor , tonight . I 'm gettin ' a nasty little feeling ' like a train 's comin ' in and I 'm gonna be under it . Know what I mean , GUNG-HO . Yeah , we 're all antsy tonight , Alpine , but don 't sweat it . That new kid , Lieutenant Falcon , is guarding ' our outer perimeter . If anyone 's dumb enough to try anything , they 've got to get past him first . I figure he 'll give us all the warning we need . Nice legs for a grease monkey , soldier . Falcon ! Want me to kiss it and make it better ? Consider this motor pool enemy territory . You 're supposed to be happy to see me , Jinx . And you 're supposed to be on guard duty . Oh , it 's Heather isn 't it . When I explain about her , you 're gonna feel so silly , you ... Stow it , Falcon . I 'm allergic to baloney . You should be guarding Serpentor . Don 't sweat it . Nobody could even get close to the stockade without an I.D. bracelet . And even if they faked the bracelet , the pene-plastic shield would stop ' em cold . But , for the sake of argument , suppose our mythical intruders did make it all the way to Serpentor 's cell block . Yeah ... They 'd still have to blast through a couple o ' yards of super-hard concrete . Uh-huh . Then they 'd have to get past three of our best guys . It 's not just unlikely , it 's impossible . The alarm circuit 's been cut ! How are you at splicing ! Nothin ' like a little on-the-job training ' ! He must not reconnect that alarm ! Gung-Ho , watch out ! Keep slicing . No , it can 't be ! Oh , brother , you are bad luck ! Hey , you 're not exactly a rabbit 's foot yourself . After them ! Deploy the Recon Sleds ! Falcon ! Take a good look at what your irresponsibility cost us ! Because YOU deserted your post , the enemy force was able to penetrate security , free Serpentor , and injure three good men ! You 're confined to quarters until court martial ! Get him out of my sight ! Even their Air Force is ugly ! Prepare the path of the steem . I , Serpentor , emperor of Cobra , salute you , most noble one . Pythona tells me I owe you my freedom . Your freedom and your life . Know that I am Golobulus , supreme ruler of this kingdom of Cobra-La . It was I who created you , Serpentor . You are mine ! No ! Serpentor is the product of my genetic engineering ! Silence , Doctor . But we combed the tombs of history 's most powerful leaders for DNA ! Didn 't it ever occur to you that such a brilliant plan was beyond the capacity of even your fine intelligence ? But it ... You perceive the facts correctly , Destro . I implanted the idea and skill in Doctor Mindbender 's rather pedestrian brain with this , a psychic motivator . I offer you my most enthusiastic obedience . And we too ! Then , so say we all . It is our greater destiny that concerns me now . Where is the Broadcast Energy Transmitter ? I was unable to capture it , but I shall not fail you again , my lord . Let 's hope not , Serpentor . I would hate to lose you . However , you will have other opportunities to serve me . First , a graver matter lies before us ... The trial of Cobra Commander ! Lieutenant Falcon , I can 't understand how an arrogant misfit like you got into this outfit in the first place ! They gonna shoot Falcon ? Not now . This is just a preliminary hearing . Three good men injured , Serpentor freed by some bizarre , new enemy , all because you can 't obey orders ! Your record is a shameful parade of insubordination and gross dereliction of duty . We searched your file , in the hope of finding some act of merit to offset the maximum penalty . We found ... none . If it please the court , I ask that the defendant be spared . On what grounds ? Duke , don 't . I just know underneath it all there 's a Joe worth saving . Falcon is my half-brother . We should confer on this . Duke , remove the defendant . Don 't do me any more favors , Duke . You 've done more than enough already. big brother . Falcon , Duke 's trying to help . How ? By bustin ' my chops every chance he gets ? I promised our mother I 'd keep an eye on him . Maybe I shouldn 't have taken the job . He did the crime , he oughta do the time ! Yeah . Now you might get penalized for his screw-ups . Hey ! Nobody 's gonna take the rap for me ! I don 't need your help anymore , Duke ! Get outta my life ! Show time . Lieutenant Falcon , it is the judgment of this tribunal that you not be boundover for court martial . But you still must answer for the serious charges against you . Falcon , you 're gonna learn what it means to be a Joe even if it kills you . I 'm sending you to the Slaughterhouse . You have no jurisdiction over me ! Release me at once or face my wrath ! I promise I 'll ... Be silent ... or be silenced ! I 'll ... I am always prepared to listen to reason , most honored sire . 'Ey , Zartan , why all this legal-fegal palaver ? Yeah , if they wanna trash old Chrome Dome , why don 't they just get on with it ? Because , Dreadnoks , we are civilized , and a great wrong has been by inflicted upon Cobra-La by Cobra Commander . That wrong must be avenged in accordance with our ancient tradition . Let the web of remembrance tell the tale ! Forty thousand years ago , the glory of Cobra-La dominated this planet . But an age of ice destroyed much of what we had built , and with it began the time of the barbarians . Surprisingly , they evolved . If you ask me , some of them did not evolve . Gradually , they mastered a technology based on inorganic , lifeless substances . Their culture was a travesty of our own noble ways , and a threat to our very existence . We retreated to preserve our ways and await an opportunity to reclaim the earth . Generations passed ... And then , a brilliant young nobleman came to my attention . Even though disfigured by a laboratory accident ... he was my choice ... to go into the world and raise a mighty army , and to destroy the so-called human civilization which had driven us into exile . You were my hope , Cobra Commander , and you failed me ... miserably ! I was betrayed ! My troops lack courage ! It was not my fault ! You failed ! No ! Your precious creation Serpentor defiled your dreams of conquest ! Destroy him I say ! Destroy him ! Behold , the culmination of centuries ! The ultimate fruit of hypergenetic manipulation , a weapon no enemy can withstand ! In several hours , these magnificent fungusoids will mature and launch hundreds of giant pods into orbit . The pods will contain spores , and the spores will degenerate all organisms they touch , mutating them into primitive , incompetent life forms . When the pods ripen , they will burst ... and shower the earth with enough spores to reduce the entire human race into mindless beasts . Only those beneath Cobra-La 's ice dome will be spared . But the pods will not ripen in freezing space , without energy ... and that is why I must have ... The Broadcast Energy Transmitter ! Of course ! Fool ! You haven 't got the B.E.T. ! You don 't even know where it is ! Your plan is laughable ! But your punishment will not be . Punishment ? What about my trial ? It 's over , and the verdict is guilty-guilty of the one unforgiveable crime : failure ! No ! No ! Not the spores ! I 'm a citizen of Cobra-La ! NOT THE SPORES ! No ! Nooo ... ooo ... ooo ... Ooh , how bizarre ! Nemesis Enforcer , throw this worthless sewage into the Abyss of Oblivion . No , put him in with the Joe prisoners , so they can see the fate which awaits them . I like that . It 's poetic in its simplicity . A trifle melodramatic , but ... Nemesis Enforcer , take him away . Yee-haw ! There it is , Lift-Ticket ! Sure don 't look cozy down there ! I dont ' think Falcon is supposed to enjoy himself , Wild Bill . Gung-Ho , Alpine , and Bazooka aren 't exactly enjoyin' their hospital stay . Put it on , smart guy ! What for ? We 're in the middle o ' nowhere. whooo ! Which is right where you belong ! Cobra ? Look what dropped in on us , brothers : a hundred and seventy pounds of air pollution ! I 've seen putty with more backbone ! I do not like his face . Let us remove it , yes ? At ease , disease ! I 've been expecting you . My name is Sergeant Slaughter , special drill instructor for GI Joe . That 's terrific , Sarge , but I 'm tryin ' to cut down on the chicken sweat just now , so if you 'll excuse me ... You 're goin ' nowhere , space case . You 're here because you 're an industrial-strength foul-up ! My job is to whip you into shape , and I 'm talkin ' whip ! There 's only two ways outta my command : on your feet like a man , or in a ditty bag--an itty , bitty ditty bag ! Got it ? Yes , Sir ! thats better ! Now straighten up and meet the Renegades . They 're not real dependable yet , but when I get through with ' em , what 're you gonna be ? Perfect ! That 's right , per-fect ! Say hello to Mercer , ex-Cobra Viper who 's seen the light . Red Dog , booted out of pro football for unnecessary roughness . And Taurus , a circus acrobat with a few loose bats in his big top . Uh , hi , guys . Okay , now that we 're all close friends , let 's head for the Slaughterhouse . Grab your gear and start hot-footin ' it . If you 're gonna be there in time for breakfast , it 's a long haul . You expect me to walk ? No , you can run ! Yo Joe ! Save my bones for Davy Jones ! He gives me chills . What 'd they do to him ? He looks ... inhuman ! Forget that , man , remember the plan ! When the guards open the gates , we 're gone . now ... Yo Joe ! Let 's go ! Wait for me ! The world will soon be ours , great Golobulus ! May your deeds match your words , Serpentor . The Joes are escaping ! We must destroy them ! You will find Cobra-La is prepared to handle all contingencies , my impetuous friend . This way out ! Yo Joe ! Stop ! It 's a trap ! Get outta my face ! No ! Look ! You see , Serpentor , there is no escape from Cobra-La . My buddies ! There 's nothing you can do to save them ! Wait ! I know another way out of Cobra-La . You can save yourself and fight again . So what 's your fee ? Snakes don 't give for free . Take me with you ! We got a bargain . But play it straight , or there 's no doubt I 'll turn your eyeballs inside-out . This way . Nemesis Enforcer , dispose of them . Don 't look ! my eyes I can 't see ! I 'll be your eyes ! Run ! Not that way ! To the left ! Now turn ! No , straight ahead ! Beautiful ! So begins the dawn of our invincibility . Forward ! Our mission is not complete until we return with the Broadcast Energy Transmitter ! Useless ! All useless ! C 'mon ! Snap out of it ! Neither of us 'll make it if you don 't hang together ! I was once a man ! A man ! I can 't see , but I can still ... hey , this is your faceplate . Was my mask , just as I was once a man ! I don 't like that crazy sound . Tell me , dude , what 's goin ' down ? The beginning of the end of human civilization , unless you warn G. I. Joe in time . Then let 's move it ! Straight ahead , a mountain path ! That 's it ! Faster ! Faster ! Sorry you missed breakfast , Falcon ( burp ) , but that 's what happens when you 're outta shape . Maybe a little K.P. ' ll help you get the lead out . Jump , yardbird ! You 're going to work till you wish you were dead , and then keep goin ' , 'cause you 're afraid if you don 't , I won 't let you die ! I can 't believe Flint hasn 't found a trace of Roadblock 's unit . The Himalayas are a big hunk of geography , Sergeant , but we can 't wait any longer . I want you to infiltrate the Terror Drome and see if Cobra knows what happened to Roadblock 's men . Uh , how 's Falcon doing ? I 'm lookin ' at him . It 's too soon to tell yet , but I think the kid 's got potential . And by the way , I won 't tell him you asked . Dinner already ? Unless you like snakeburgers . We 're gonna infiltrate the Terror Drome no Cobra Island . That 's suicide ! Yes . Horoscope say is bad day to travel . Think of it as an extra-rough training exercise . Training , huh ? Then why don 't we leave our weapons behind and make it really educational ? Now that 's what I call a challenge . No weapons ! Let 's move out ! Cobra will never think of looking for the B.E.T. in a civilian security lab . Let 's hope not . Anyway , it 'll be safer here until our missing buddies return . Mercer , you know the layout . How do we get in ? In this stinking swamp , even big , bad Cobras need air conditioning . That 's our ticket in . The real men can go in . The cowards can stay out here . Central control is that way . The Baroness has located the Broadcast Energy Transmitter . The Joes can 't stop us from capturing it now . They 're off balance and undermanned . Strato-Vipers , when the battle is won , to you shall go the honor of flying the transmitter back to Cobra-La ! Hail , Serpentor ! Hail , Cobra ! Hail , victory ! You 're not fillin' your brothers in , Mercer . What 's Cobra-La ? I never heard of it . That answer gives me no comfort . Pipe down . I believe him . Right now we gotta warn headquarters . Falcon , can you get the word out ? No sweat . Then do it . We 'll blow up their armory , and rattle reptile from here to Cobra-La . Yo Joe ! Yo Joe ! Come on ! Come in , G. I. Joe . Acknowledge . If they keep shootin ' , we all blow up ! Come in , G. I. Joe ! Acknowledge ! come on , lets go 'in . Yo Joe ! It 's time to go bye-bye , or boom-boom ! Where 's Falcon ? Who cares ? We don 't need ! It 's time you learned we 're a team , Red Dog . We all go home or nobody goes home ! Yo Joe ! How many in your force ? What is the purpose of your mission ? You can 't resist forever ! You 're right . All I gotta do is hold out for five ... more ... minutes . Insolent fool ! If you won 't answer me , you can answer Nemesis Enforcer ! Yo Joe ! When I 'm through with you , scuz-bucket , they 're gonna scrape you off the walls with a squeegee . Nemesis Enforcer ! Finish him off , we have work to do ! Ahh ! Nemesis Enforcer ! Help me ! You , you came back for me . Don 't get sloppy . Just point me at that overgrown bat . No time for rematch ! Remember bomb ! Must hurry ! Let 's get outta here ! Cobra is finished , yes ? Don 't bet your beard on it . I want their heads ! This I command ! Perimeters are secured , sir ! Secure the B.E.T. ! Cobra 's after the Broadcast Energy Transmitter ! You rally the ground troops . I 'll call out the airborne assault team . Yo Joe ! Hey , wait up ! There goes our ride . That ain 't necessarily so ! I 'll hotwire this baby and we 're outta here . Fly it , Jinx ! Yo Joe ! Ay , carumba ! Oh no ! Aw , nuts ! etc . First one to say anything about my being bad luck gets a knuckle massage . I can see the whites of their beedy little eyes ! Yo J ... What the ... Shoot ' em down , whatever they are ! Okay , Chuckles , let 's give this whirlybird a twirl ! All right , let 's go ! Okay , guys , prove us Rawhides aren 't raw ! Man , who ever heard of being shot down by salad ? Pour it on , Joes ! We can 't let ' em get their hands on the B.E.T .. Bandits at 12 o 'clock high ! Regroup ! Cobra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la - la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ! Maintain air attack , and deploy the Marauders ! Whoah ! Open it ! Wow ! Inform Serpentor the prize is ours . Go for the underbelly ! These things aren 't invulnerable after all ! At last ! What ? Yo Joe ! Concentrate firepower ! etc . Evacuate the B.E.T. at once ! Yo Joe ! Cobra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la - la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ! Falcon ! You , young one . You nearly thwarted my destiny ! Duke ! Die , arrogant earth scum ! NO ! Duke ? He took the snake meant for your heart , but his sacrifice will be in vain ! This I command ! General Hawk ! Bad news ! Serpentor got the B.E.T. , and Duke is seriously injured ! See to him ! I 'm coming in ! How is he , Scarlett ? Not good . Looks like I can 't look out for you any more , kid . Don 't say that , Duke ! Doc 'll fix you up ! This isn 't Doc 's day for miracles . It 's my own fault I 'm too slow . No , No , you did it to save me ! Promise me you 'll try to get your act together , be a credit ... to your country . I , I 'll make you proud ! You 'll see ! Yo ... Joe ... He 's gone into a coma . Duke . Falcon , don 't worry . We 'll do everything we can for Duke . Yo Joe . Hail , Golobulus ! Behold , the proof of our victory . When this timeworm completes its journey , the pods will ripen , the spores will burst forth , and this pitiful planet will be ours . General Hawk , I 've identified that energy source ! It 's definitely coming from the B.E.T. cobra 's got it somewhere in the Himalayas . Prepare to move out . All I want is Serpentor . Just give me one clear shot . Not so fast , Rawhide , you 're not goin ' anyplace . Problem , Beach Head ? Affirmative . I 'm not sure the Rawhides are ready yet , and I 'm ' specially not sure about him . But , Serpentor ... Beach Head is right . The six of you still lack experience . I have a right ! What you have is an order , G. I. Joe ! Besides , we need someone to guard the base and try to contact Flint . Yes , sir ! Useless ! All useless ! I was a man ! Yessssss ... Oh , yesss ... I wassssss a man ... I was a man , yessss ... Stop sayin ' that , you hear ? You 're makin ' me crazy ! Was a man ! Men may rule , but serpents never ! Was a ... You 're goin ' snakehouse , man ! You gotta resist ! Yes ! WAS ONCE A MAN ! Stop strangling ' me ! There he is ! Hey , it 's Roadblock ! etc . Some rescue party we turned out to be ! Roadblock found us ! Who is it ? I don 't need to see clear to fracture your rear ! Easy , Roadblock . You 're with friends . Lifeline ? Lifeline ! Flint ! Roadblock ! Hawk 's leading a strike force to Serpentor 's home base , a place called Cobra-La . Patch me through ! We 've gotta warn him ! Warn him ? About what ? Plants , man . The kind that gobble you up . Yo Joe ! Yo Joe ! Sound the alarm ! The Joes are attacking ! I 'm aware of that , Serpentor ! I am aware of everything . All shall be accomplished in the fullness of time . Yo Joe ! Hawk , don 't send ' em in ! Cobra-La is booby-trapped ! How , Roadblock ? Some kinda weird tree , man . Where those leaves grow , you can 't survive . That giant plant eats Joes alive ! Get back ! Halt ! Watch out men ! Get back ! Get back ! Hey , que pasa , Jinx ? Hawk and the others were ambushed entering Cobra-La . Look at Cobra Commander ! Those orbiting pods contain degenerative spores , and if the B.E.T. isn 't shut down , the pods will open and release enough spores to mutate every man , woman , and child on Earth ! That 's not gonna happen ! Right ? Right ! Let 's win this game ! I think your vision can be restored , but there 's nothing I can do for the snake . The mutation process is irreversible . Wassss ... a man ! I hear somethin ' ... and now I can see it comin ' in ! I never thought I 'd be glad to see you show up , Falcon . Thanks , Flint . Now Roadblock , how are we gonna get in to save Hawk and the others ? Cobra Commander is the only one who can tell us . Which way now , man ? You hear me , man ? Forget it . He 's completely turned into a snake . Now how do we know which way to go ? Hey , wait ! Listen ... I think I just found a back door ! How come we gotta seal this tunnel ? If we don 't , those spores will filter in and mutate us , you bug-brain . You wonna wait a claim or something 'Allo , ' allo , allo ! Adios , adios , adios ! Those fool Dreadnoks ! They fly too close to the carnal trees ! Wait , those aren 't Dreadnoks . They 're ... G.I. Joes ! And Big Lob makes his move ! Uh-oh ! Aggressive defense ! He takes a hit , but keeps comin ' ! Will the clock run out before his mission is complete ? No ! He shoots ... Is it good ? Yes ! Forward ! Shoot 'em plants . Oh , brother . Yo Joe ! General Hawk ! We 've gotta shut down the B.E.T. ! Then let 's do it , soldier ! Yo Joe ! They 're advancing on the palace ! They are too late . But , to assuage your fears , I shall take precautions . Organisms of Cobra-La , detach , and defend to the death ! C 'mon ! Yeah ! Let 's go ! etc . Yo Joe ! Head for the palace ! Not bad for a first date , huh ? Yeah , but next time let 's watch a horror flick instead of living one ! Shut down the B.E.T. ! I 'll keep this party going ! There ! Obliterate them ! Vengeance is ours ! The big sleaze-bat belongs to me ! you 're terrific Your brother fell before my wrath , and so shall you ! Hold still , witch ! Prepare for eternity ! Your life has ended ! Okay , lady , it 's time for lights out ! Your breath sears your lungs . Your eyes dim . Your ... Wasss a man ... Yesss ... Cobra Commander ! No ! I always knew I wasn 't unlucky . This is for Gung-Ho , Alpine , and Bazooka ! ( grunts ) This is for Falcon ! ( grunts ) This is for me ! ( grunts ) This is for Duke ! ( grunts ) And this is for the U.S. of A. ! ( grunts ) You make me sick ! Enough ! This game is over ! Falcon ! You 're next , whatever you are . I will stain my hands with your blood ! No one , no one defies Golobulus and lives ! No one ! Don 't give up ! The last thing you will hear is the cracking of your vertebrae , one by one ! He did it ! He shut off the B.E.T. Heroic , and utterly futile . Behold , the pods have matured ! There is no way to stop the spores ! You have lost , G. I. Joe ! Lost ! We failed . No. not yet ! What are you doing ? If I can rev up enough juice ... You can fry those spores in space ! It 's gonna blow ! Warn the others ! Get outta here ! And leave you ? No way ! Forget me ! Save yourselves ! Falcon , we all go home or nobody goes home ! Jump , Falcon ! Grab my ankles ! General Hawk , do you read me ? This is Doc at headquarters . Great news ! Duke 's come out of his coma ! Looks like we 've made it . Men , Doc says Duke 's gonna be A-OK ! Yo Joe ! Look at the sky ! The last of the mutation spores are burning up in orbit . Thanks , big brother . Let 's go .

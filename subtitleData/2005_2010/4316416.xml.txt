 Eliot is not the father because the baby doesn 't have a father . How could that even happen ? Parthenos : virgin . Genesis : birth . And chances are ... she won 't be normal . She 'll be the daughter of God . It 's as though animals are learning an aggressive behaviour . - They 're becoming better killers . - Hear about the man in Maynooth ? - What about him ? - He went wild . Smashing the restaurant . His wife said he was babbling like a madman . - What kind of stuff was he gathering ? - Chanterelles , cranberries . Chanterelles , mushrooms . What if he ate the wrong kind of mushroom ? You mean like a bad trip ? We 've been studying ways to repair optic nerve damage for several years now . However , when the procedure fails , our test subjects are left totally blind . Dr. Turnbull arranged to do the operation here at St. Mikes . That 's great news . Well , it 's a day of miracles , Bob . Hey , Eliot , how come you didn 't call me back ? What was that news conference all about ? You 're making your daughter look like a freak show ! - Don 't , Wes . - I watched the news ! Molly is the new Virgin Mary , come on . - Molly ... - What 're you getting out of this ? - Wes ! Wes ! Just listen to me . - What ? She lost the baby . When did it happen ? I don 't know . She started to get cramps and ... And then the blood ... Lots of blood . How 's she doing ? She was so scared . - Can I speak to her , Eliot ? - She 's resting . Of course . I 'm sorry . Give her a kiss for me when she wakes up . You know what she said ? The baby died because no one believed . Weston Field ... No , no comment . Bob . You wanted to hear the Goldberg Variations ? I 'll take that as a yes . - Yes . - And how are we doing , Bob ? - Fine ... - Good . We 'll see you in recovery . Alright . Let 's build some bridges . Wes ! Wes . Call for an ambulance . Yes , hello , we have an emergency . I need an ambulance at NorBAC on Queen Street . Yes , I will . Thank you . ReGenesis 3x11 Adrift Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Dapitch666 , Bbsiocnarf , Linwelin Version NoTag 1.0 Bob ? Bob . Mm . Citrus . Jasmine . Is that a Cattleya ? Memoria Crispin Rosales ? If that means Pine Knot . It does . I remember when we left the Soviet Union , everything was brown like a potato . We landed in Israel and it was like a symphony for the senses . Fruits , fabrics , flowers . I ... asked my mother : " What 's in my nose ? " And I remember her saying : " Life . " And a year later you were shoveling snow in Canada . How 're you feeling ? Oh , my ... Good . Tired . Hang on . What ? No , I 'm with Bob in post-op . He did ? Is he alright ? - Hi . - Hi . So I was unsure if he was on drugs or having a psychotic breakdown . So I ordered our standard full toxicology screen . It tests for : cocaine , amphetamines , heroin , morphine , PCP , alcohol , THC , et cetera . - And he was negative for everything . - So you think it was psychotic ? From the way he presented , I think he was on hallucinogen . But for that test , I have to send it out overnight . Alright , but I know this man and he doesn 't take drugs . People slip people drugs . Could you send me a sample of his blood ? I 'd like my labs to take a look at it . Sure . Well , there he is . How are you ? Groovy . You know , Bob , If you got a bigger place , somebody could stay with you and take care of you . I mean , come on , you 've been in that bachelor since you were a grad student . Don 't you think it 's time for a change ? Bob ? Melnikov , where are you ? How the hell 'd you get out here ? Trust . I imagined you guiding me . Don 't get weird on me , Bob . I 've always trusted you , David . From the moment I met you . - Really ? - Really . Now would be a lousy time to tell you that I never wanted to hire you ? - At NorBAC ? - NorBAC ? I 'm talking about our first lab . Liar . No , it 's true . Oh , I 'd heard all about you . " The man 's got a brain the size of Russia . " And I figured , I 'll just see about that . Brilliant minds aren 't a dime a dozen in this business . You walked into my office , your handshake was ... weak and wet . The interview was a complete disaster . You coughed and mumbled through every answer to all my questions . Then you broke into the most eloquent digression about ancient Egypt and perfume . And promptly stood up and left before the interview was over . I figured I 'd never see you again . Yeah . Then you did something completely unexpected . What ? You showed up for work the next day . Well , you never told me I didn 't get the job . You are one determined mother , Bob . That 's why when these bandages come off , I am going to see . Thought we 'd order in tonight . - How about Asaad 's Curry Palace ? - No . The city didn 't like their ... Aloo Gobi cockroach . What ? Yeah . It 's Rachel . - Say Hi . - Bob says , Hi . How 's Wes ? He 's alive . - Can 't win ' em all . - I heard that , David . - How 's Bob ? - He 's fine . So they think Wes may have been on some sort of hallucinogen . Hey , cool , Wes . Oh yeah . Trippy . And the suggestion was that he may have been slipped something . - Nobody slipped me . - What 'd you eat ? - Were you in containment booth " A " ? - Yeah , for a minute . I wrote you a note . What 'd you have in there , Rachel ? I had the specimens in there from the restaurant where the chef went nuts . I didn 't touch anything . - Maybe a mushroom species ? - Look . Do a GC / MS on Wes 's blood to see if you can figure it out . Hey Wes , did you see God ? Yeah . He 's sorry he 's never gonna get the chance to meet you . Alright . So there are 180 species of fungi that cause hallucinations . Now we are set to run GC / MS analysis for hallucinogenic alkaloids in the 3 varieties of psilocybin mushrooms that could grow in Ontario . - Good . - Trouble is , there 's just not very much that 's known about hallucinogenic mushrooms . Oh , lots is known . Just not by scientists . - Oh , newspaper . Can I borrow that ? - Sure . - David ... - Sorry , dude I 'm all outta weed . I just thought you should know . Molly lost the baby . Good . - It 's for the best , Wes . - I know . Hey . - Busy ? - Yeah , I 'm working on my hockey pool . What 's up ? None of the mushrooms tested positive for hallucinogens . Okay . What other samples came from the chef ? Watercress , wild rice and cranberries . Check for LSD . That was always my favourite . But LSD 's synthetic . Its precursor was all-natural . Ergot . That 's it . That 's got to be it . Alright , thank you very much . You 're welcome . So what is ergot ? It 's a mould on grasses . It 's how they discovered LSD . As a matter of fact , it 's one of the explanations for the Salem witch trials . They think that the women baked with rye - and got ergot . - I didn 't eat anything . No , I know you didn 't . But they 've also shown that it can be inhaled , so ... - So the bears ... - Well , ate wild rice ? Inhaled it ? I don 't know . Weston Field . Could you get Dave and Carlos ? - Yes . - Tell them it 's urgent . Of course , go . We got the SOS yesterday at 16 : 00 hours . She was towed in a little over an hour ago . This whole part of the port 's been sealed . Of the 24 on the crew manifest , 22 are missing . - Captain 's the only survivor ? - Correct . We need NorBAC to answer 3 questions : Is this outbreak contagious ? What 's the cause ? - Is it safe to evacuate ? - Show us . The Captain has an excellent record . On the other hand , this is international shipping , which is not far removed from 16th-century piracy . Dr. Lee ! This is Doctor Serrano and Doctor Sandström from NorBAC . What do we have , Doctor ? Severe dehydration . And there was plenty of good drinking water on board . We 'll test it to see how good it is . - What else ? - Well he 's got stiffness , memory loss but no sign of concussion . And no indication yet of pathology . What do you remember , Captain ? Left Istanbul with cargo . Manifest says that was 17 days ago . What kind of cargo ? 1.3 million kilos ... - Cobalt . - Yeah , from Kazakhstan . - Unload in Miami . - Yeah , that was 7 days ago . Everything 's good . They stayed in port 36 hours . Next call New York . - Load new cargo . - They never arrived . That 's the last thing I remember . Till yesterday . This is the Delia Wren . We are presently 44 ° , 38 ' ... North ; 61 ° , 40 ' West ! Mayday , mayday ! What happened to your crew ? I barricaded myself ... in my quarters . Why ? I thought they were going to kill me . They were ... mad . Why ? I don 't know why . Do you want to see the body now ? Yeah . This way . Right through here . So do you believe him ? I don 't believe anybody . Watch yourself . The stairs might be slippery . Watch your step coming down here . Over there ! Okay . What the fuck are those ? Those are ... I don 't know . - Why is he in his underwear ? - He felt hot ? In this weather ? Fever ? I 'd like Rachel to take a look at these lesions . Yeah . Good idea . Fuck ! There 's another one . Watch out ! - What was he doing up there ? - Is everything alright ? Okay , take your pictures and let 's get the hell out of here . - Any pain , Bob ? - No . Good , okay . Now , I 'll need you to keep your eyes closed . - Okay . - Alright . It 's coming in here . Alright . There we go . It 's off , just keep them closed . There . There . Okay . Now ... You can open them up . They might be a little sticky . - They are . - Okay . Just be careful here . Just coming here , like that . There . Okay , Bob . I need you to cover the eye that we didn 't treat . What do you see ? Nothing . What about now ? Right , okay ... Might have to cover the eye that we treated for a little longer , just to be safe . - Okay . - Okay ? - Okay . - It 's okay , Bob . It 's okay , it 's okay . We found 6 more bodies . Half-clothed and dead like the rest . - Freight was cobalt , right ? - Yeah . Doesn 't cobalt make you sick ? It can cause respiratory irritation , pulmonary oedema . Not symptoms like this . Well , isn 't cobalt radioactive ? The cobalt you 're thinking of is Cobalt-60 . It 's a synthetic byproduct , but they 'd never ship it in quantities like this . - I 'll test for radioactivity . - And blood cells and platelets - in Calambakas and the dead crewmen . - Okay . They 've looked everywhere . It looks like 1 living , 10 dead , 13 missing , presumably overboard . He scratched his skin off . They all did . Except Calambakas . It appears he wasn 't infected . So what happened to his memory ? Maybe he 's lying . David , Carlos , I can 't make heads or tails of this . You said the boat came from Turkey , so I 've sent the images to the best virologist in Istanbul . If I hear anything , I will let you know . Let me know if you have any questions . Okay . My blood test results . Apparently the bears and I were tripping on LSD . I can 't wait till the next time I apply for a government job and they ask if I 've done any illicit drugs . I 'll write you a note . Stomach , bladder and colon are all empty . - Seems to be the pattern . - But the liver 's enlarged . It appears our deceased here stopped eating and drinking days before he died . With some hemorrhagics , they get a petechial rash . Is that possible ? I 've never autopsied a hemorrhagic . Not big here in Nova Scotia . We 're gonna need you to harvest a complete set of organs . Include brain and blood and scrapings from under the fingernails . What are you thinking ? I 'm thinking I haven 't got a clue . I 'm supposed to remind you to call Ann Turnbull . - When we got to the airport . - I forgot . Ann ! David Sandström . I 'm gonna put you on speaker so my colleague Dr. Carlos Serrano can listen in . Okay , great . - So how 'd it go with Bob ? - Well , I was up in Toronto today to personally conduct the tests on Bob and the nanotrellises have formed . They 're in the right places , and they 're beautifully aligned . There 's a " but " coming . The axons started to grow and then they stopped and in our animal studies we always see the initial spurt but then the growth continues . We gotta figure out why they stopped . What growth factor did you use ? Wyman Biologics NGF-3 . It 's a mix of FGF and ... NT-3 and BNDF . I did a little research on it . It 's the most widely used cocktail for experimental nerve regeneration , right ? By far . We don 't even have an alternative . Alright , I 'll get back to you in a few days . What are you thinking ? Bob , it 's me . Hi , David . But ... Okay . Yeah ... Thanks , David . Bye . You got him ? What 'd he say ? I think ... I think he 's very confused and frustrated . I don 't want to waste any more of his time . David wastes time all the time , Bob . You 're right . Remember when he dated that exotic dancer ? Belinda . Listen , I was a mess with my leg , right ? And it worked out . Okay , so you just have to be positive , alright ? I saw Dr. Turnbull 's face . I could tell that she thought it was hopeless . And that was her opinion , okay . She doesn 't know David Sandström . That 's true . Come here . Thanks for being here , Mayko . Dr. Morris Fishbain . David Sandström , NorBAC . Listen , I 'm calling about your work on stimulating axon growth in sea cucumbers . Right ... Yeah , you got any experience doing it with humans ? Dr. Leung ? Dr. Chandrananda ? Doctor ... Doc ... Screw you all . We 'll do it ourselves . ... whether or not Jack Layton will form the government . 3.5 million people in the Greater Seattle Area are without cell phone communication for a second day . Engineers are still unable to explain why the mass disruption has occurred but they are certain they will have service back up ... Hi , David . Not interested in that fascinating news broadcast ? I 'm not interested in more things going wrong . That sounds uncaring . I 'm sorry . Bob , what are you doing ? Mayko called me . She said you went to bed . I thought I 'd make some soup . Soup . - Gimme that knife . - David , - I 'm not completely blind . - It 's not that , it 's not that . I got you something from Halifax . Here . Trade ya . Nephropidae ! Squeaks . Did you know that the average lobster 's 3 pounds but they once caught one off the coast of Nova Scotia that was 44 pounds ? Amazing things happen , Bob . Like how we 're gonna get your optic nerves to grow again . I just don 't know if that eye can take another procedure . We could use the other eye . Bob , you 've got 25 % vision in that eye . You wanna risk going blind in both of them ? I don 't know . - Where are we at ? - Testing for viruses in all the organ - samples from the sailors . - Remember the petechial rashes - Carlos was talking about ? - Hemorrhagic fevers . We 're on it . - Blood and urine ? - With Carlos . We 're redoing the tox screens . Maybe we 're looking at a neurotoxin . - Like bee venom ? - Bee , scorpion , spider , snake . We should do a full screen for metals or gasses that cause neurotoxicity . I 'm going to check for Batrachotoxins . It 's too bad . Bob 's really good at this kind of thing . So get him on it . He 's going to think we 're patronizing him . He 's still on the payroll . I expect him to earn his cheque like the rest of us . Where are we at with food and water ? Mayko . - Food and water ? - Nothing that could cause allergies . - The dust samples from the ship 's hold ? - U of T is testing for radioactivity . You better put a trace on that cobalt . Find out where it went . - Just in case . - Sure . So Turkey is not reporting any outbreaks with these symptoms . I checked with Kazakhstan where the cobalt originated . Nothing . And U of T is confirming what we suspected , that the dust in the cargo hold is not radioactive . Who here speaks Korean ? I believe there 's a Korean scientist on the 5th floor doing a post-doc in bio-engineering . I can get her if you like . These guys have got a treatment for late stage glaucoma . They 're using Hoelen , alisma , polyporus , and cinnamon twig . - Are we that desperate ? - Gettin ' there . David , we found , in Captain Calambakas 's blood , domoic acid . Domoic acid ? ! It 's a neurotoxin in Red Tide , right ? So if the captain ate shellfish that went through a Red Tide algal bloom , he 'd get poisoned with domoic acid . Which would lead to dizziness , disorientation , and memory loss . - Like our Captain . And the others ? - No domoic acid in the dead seamen . So what ? Calambakas got invited to a clambake and no one else was ? Sometimes Captains eat at more expensive restaurants . - You ran this for GC / MS ? - Of course . It 's your boring , garden-variety Red Tide . - Okay ? - Okay . I was examining the forearm evidence . Sounds like fun . And , nothing in the lesions . But I found the remnants of an insect skin under the fingernail scrapings of , " Dead Sailor " number 3 . What kind of insect ? I don 't know . We could do a PCR . But , maybe it was laid there after they died . Yeah , or it could be responsible for spreading the disease . Maybe . Send it to Entomology at U of T. - So where are we at ? - These are from the EUMETSAT . - EUMETSAT ? - The Europeans . They 're sea surface temperature images for the Mediterranean where the Delia Wren was crossing . But all the temperatures are below the threshold for Red Tide . Here , look . These are coastal zone scanner images , that look for Red Tide . But there 's nothing , right ? Like , there 's nothing anywhere . So ... I asked myself , okay , if there was no Red Tide in the Mediterranean , then where was there Red Tide ? Answer . - Just off the coast of Ghana . - Africa . And that 's about as far as I 've gone . - Okay , keep going . - Okay . Do we have any of Bob 's DNA hanging around ? Yeah . We have his genome from when we use him as a control in all those experiments . - What are you up to ? - I 'm just thinking . What ? Maybe Bob has a genetic anomaly . You know , like , maybe because he 's Russian or Jewish or just Bob , the receptors that the Wyman NGF-3 targets are different in him . But even if it is , it would take years to reformulate the growth factor . Bullshit . Not years , come on . Look . If this is the best we can do , maybe ... - Thanks , Carlos . - Sorry , David . But ... - Okay , look , you need some help . - No , stay on what you 're doing . Optic nerve growth factor . Myelin-Associated Protein Dammit . Where is everybody ? Wes is on a phone call . He said to start without him . Thank you . Here 's Rachel . Hey , where 's David ? I knocked on his door . He shouted back : " Leave me alone . " So ... Probably a good idea . Okay , Mayko ? So I spoke with the harbour authority in Istanbul . The Delia Wren wasn 't there . It never picked up any cargo . - Why is the Captain lying ? - You 're saying it was Africa ? Well , that 's where the Red Tide was . Africa ? What are they hiding ? Where is Wes ? Wes ! - He 'll be here in a minute . - What do you got , Rachel ? This is the entomology report on that insect skin . The DNA was degraded , inconclusive . Got any real news ? Well , I do . The sequence analysis from the CDC says we might have a variant on the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever - in the dead sailors . - Might ? Variant ? Come on , Rachel . It 's early days , but it looks like a new strain . A variant on the closest version of the disease that we have sequenced . Could it be the cause of the symptoms we 're observing ? Well , some genes suggest it and some genes don 't . But the symptoms are a match to classic Crimean Congo , right ? Yes . Dizziness , headache , fever . - Rashes , mood swings , confusion . - That might be it then . But CCHF is tick-borne . No ticks were found on the bodies . Maybe the fever found another kinda insect to live on . Maybe . But what about the captain ? He didn 't have the fever . Maybe he 's immune . Maybe he didn 't get off the boat . Maybe he was eating shellfish while everyone else was at the bar - being bit by ticks . - Hung out with a few sailors , have you ? CCHF , you die of pulmonary failure , right ? Or liver and kidney failure . Check to see if the domoic acid from the Red Tide has any effect on CCHF . Is there any outbreak of CCHF anywhere in the world right now ? Yes , one in Gabon . All roads lead to Africa . Sorry , guys . This is a little bit weird . I 've been tracing the shipment on the Delia Wren and I just got a call from a state trooper in Pinard , Idaho . Apparently , one of the trucks carrying the cobalt was found abandoned . The driver jumped out of the truck covered in lesions , tore his clothes off wandered out onto the highway where he was a victim of a hit-and-run . I 've asked for a full set of samples from both cargo and the deceased to be sent up here . - What 's the story ? - Given that we seem to be dealing with some kind of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever , which should be delivered by a tick , I went through every inch of the contents of that barrel . And there was nothing organic . No larvae , no insects , no eggs , nothing . Could be in other barrels , on other trucks . - That 's true . - It gets better . It 's not even cobalt . - What ? - It 's coltan . - What 's coltan ? - Tantalite-columbite . It 's like a metallic ore that 's made of some stuff called niobium and tantalum . I still don 't know what the fuck it is . It 's used in cell phones , TVs , DVD players , computers . So what does this have to do with CCHF ? Well , the biggest suppliers are Australia and the not-so-Democratic Republic of the Congo . Africa again . Near Gabon where the hemorrhagic fever is - and Ghana where the Red Tide was . - Why would they lie about their cargo ? The export of coltan helped fuel a civil war in the DRC . Four million dead . No one wants to buy coltan because of consumer pressure . They use child labour . It 's the cheapest source . As a result , there 's been speculation , smuggling , fluctuations in the price . And they unloaded all this stuff in Miami , right ? 1.3 million kilos on board . Which is now on trucks heading all over the place . Very hush-hush , almost impossible to trace . So we got truckers spreading a disease or carrying a cargo that is , and we have no way of finding them ? Is that about it ? We will . So far there are no other reports of truckers exhibiting the symptoms . You gotta stay on top of that . Rachel . Is it Crimean-Congo Fever ? Well , we think it is . But it doesn 't respond to Ribavarin in vitro . So there 's no cure ? No . You have gotta find those fucking trucks , Wes . MacPherson . David Sandstrom , NorBAC . Follow me . How can I help you , sir ? I want you to talk to Captain Calambakas . He 's full of shit . He was never in Istanbul . - What ? - He was in Africa . He was smuggling . Well , won 't be the first . You 'll have to talk to him directly . - Even better . - He left for the US this morning . What ? I thought there was an investigation going on . Well , it is . But the crimes were committed in US waters . What crimes ? Seven bodies were found off the coast of Maine . Some of the missing crewmen , bludgeoned to death . - Is he a suspect ? - Well , certainly a witness . Some witness : he can 't even remember the most shocking week of his life . - Where can I find him ? - I don 't know . I 'll get back to you . Jesus , I don 't know what people are thinking . Does this work ? David , what are you doing ? I 'm being metaphoric . Okay . Bob 's optic nerve , right ? Bob 's a growing man . Mother Nature doesn 't want him to keep growing , otherwise his optic nerve would be , like , 20 feet long . So at a certain point , his body naturally puts a brake on . But we want that nerve to grow , so we add in Wymans Biologics NGF-3 to the gas can . And that 's basically like just pushing down on the gas pedal . So frankly , we 're trying to drive a car with the brake on . - Right , so how do you remove the brake ? - We produce an siRNA for the p75 - NT receptor . - The brake ? And the siRNA eliminates the p75 NT receptor , which effectively eliminates the brake . Okay , but how do you know the car is going to go this way and not this way ? Nanotrellises will direct the growth . Did you talk to Turnbull about this ? I wanted to run it by you first . Because I think this is the best we can do . How do you know the siRNA 's going to work ? Okay . From what I gather , there 's a guy in Portugal doing this with sea slugs . Sea slugs have eyes ? Sort of . What about delivery ? We use a herpes virus vector . Just like Angelica Starov did with Owen . It worked ! The gene therapy is what turned him into a basket case . The herpes virus vector worked fine . What Angelica did wasn 't completely wrong . Her work with Owen advanced science . We can build on that . Maybe , maybe what happened to Owen won 't be for nothing . Try telling that to Owen . Christian Barnard 's first heart transplant recipient lived for a grand total of 18 days . Now , people live for decades with organ transplants . My point is nothing ventured , nothing gained , and Bob goes blind . Carlos , do you think this will work ? Call Turnbull . Thanks . So , Doctor Turnbull says it 's up to you . - What did you say ? - I said I 'd ask you . One eye is very frustrating , David . - No eyes might be more frustrating . - Yeah . Okay , my rook to E-1 . - Are you sure you wanna do that ? - Fuck off , Bob . Okay ... Queen to E-8 . - Bob , that means your queen ... - I know . Alright . My rook to E-8 . There goes your queen . I see what you 're doing . It 's a little risky , don 't you think ? - I like to gamble . - Since when ? Since I decided to try the siRNA . Are you smiling ? Yeah . With Owen , the herpes virus worked too well . - I was thinking of a kill switch . - Me too . We could use one with a pronounced weakness for antivirals . If it works too well , I 'll take a famciclovir and - that 'll be the end of it . - That 's a good idea . Rook to A-1 . Checkmate ? Yeah . So , domoic acid has no effect on hemorrhagic fevers . - Well , that 's not surprising . - But along with domoic acid , Red Tide also produces a number of polycyclic ethers . Ciguatoxins , gambierol , yessotoxins , gymnocins . - Yeah ? - Each one of them has been associated - with antiviral activities . - You 're kidding . So Red Tide 's a cure for Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever ? Possible . That would explain why the Captain never got sick . - I 'll leave this with you . - Thank you . Rachel , my back is extremely itchy . - Do you mind taking a look ? - No , of course not . Driving me crazy . - Oh my God . - What ? - Are these from the boat ? - Are they tick boils ? I don 't know what these are . - Oh shit . - Other than itching , - what are your symptoms ? - I feel fine . - Any more of them ? - I don 't think so . Let 's cut it open . - Really ? Want to ? - Yes . Feel anything ? - No , go ahead . - Okay . Oh my God . What ? Hold still . Rachel . No ! This circuit board is from the mainframe at LAX air traffic control . - It 's covered in some organic slime . - Like a biofilm ? Exactly and it 's all over the circuit board . Thousands of people were caught mid-air . We just narrowly averted a catastrophe . What ? ! Okay , what is going on around here ? ! Maybe it has contaminated NorBAC . Carl Riddlemeyer on the take . He 's terrified . We need to talk . Here are your files . Boxes full of dead ends . So you 're telling me that you have nothing . I got nothing that 's admissible in court , nothing that the justice department 's gonna find of any interest . What the hell is going on ?

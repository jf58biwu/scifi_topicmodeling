 [ bird chirping distant ] [ dog barks ] [ rooster crows ] [ hissing and rattling ] Boys ? Ya 'll ready yet ? [ door opens ] [ footsteps ] ( boy 's voice ) Yes , ma 'am . I 'm ready . Where 's your brother ? Ohh . Les , honey . I can see you breathing . I don 't wanna go ! . I don 't wanna ! Ohhh . I don 't wanna go ! . I don 't wanna ! It ain 't up to you to decide . I don 't wanna ! The Lord says you 're ready . I don 't wanna go ! Now , Lester , enough of that . Come on . You best not let your daddy see you cryin ' . Come on , get in the car . We 're all set . Let 's go . ( Dad ) slide over , boys . There we go . [ hissing ] ( male voice ) Praise the Lord ! Hallelujah ! ( many ) Hallelujah ! Behold ! I give unto you the power to tread on serpents and scorpions . Nothing by any means shall hurt thee ! Rise ! Rise ! [ clapping ] [ much shouting , clapping ] ( father ) Go over , son . Come on , Les . ( brother ) Here , Les . You take him . Praise God ! ( father ) T rust God . Don 't you fear that snake ! Agh ! ( brother ) Oh ! Oh my God ! Dad ! Dad ! No ! Dad ! No ! Dad ! It 's okay , son . ( minister ) Have praise ! It 's God 's will ! Somebody help him ! He 's dead ! What are you doing ? . Help him ! Call a doctor ! Somebody help him . [ bells toll ] ( mother ) Les ? Coffee , honey ? ( male voice ) Don 't do anything you don 't want to . Just come sit in the pews . It 's gonna be a real nice service . It 'd mean a whole hell of a lot to Ma . ( Les ) I got to get to work . Well , just this once , Les . It 'd be a decent thing to do to honor your daddy 's memory . Ma , best thing I can do to honor Daddy 's memory , is stay the hell away from snakes . If you feared God half as much as you feared that snake , Dad would still be alive . That 's enough , Duff . Your praying couldn 't save Daddy . Maybe a little medicine could 've . ( female voice , radio ) Les , you copy ? Yeah . Les , here . We got something down by the river . I 'm on my way outside ! Where are you ? . Morning , partner . Morning , Faye . You got the keys ? . Sure . Oopsie . And a good morning to you too . I got a girlfriend , remember that . [ siren ] My brother James , I was climbing a tree when he pulled me down . Don 't blame me , boogerfoot . You just fell . ( Erin ) Mr. Jensen , you can 't leave your garbage out like that . I was gonna clean it up . Not only are you ruining the environment , but you can be attracting wild animals . Young lady , I spent six years in a Vietnamese prison camp . I think I can handle a few animals . That ain 't gonna take stitches now , is it ? . ( Les ) A couple of Band-Aids will do the trick . See , ya mother him too much . " He 's gotta go to the hospital . " " You gotta call an ambulance . " Actually , you might want to get him to a hospital . It could be a concussion or even worse . Thanks , Doctor . Walk it off , Billy . I feel like fishin ' . ( mother ) Poor baby . ( Les ) Erin , wait up . I 've got work to do . Alright , I get it , I get it . Sorry about the other night . We both said things we didn 't mean . I meant every word I said . Okay . Les , I love you but I 'm not a kid anymore . I wanna get married , I wanna have a family . I don 't understand why you 're so afraid of growing up . I 'm not afraid ! I can 't wait around for you forever . If you 're not ready to be a man , I gotta find someone who is . You got a lot of other offers on the table right now ? . Many offers . Yeah ? Like who ? Oh , so many . Like , for example--Bo . Bo ? . That 's Big Bo to you , Pinky . Nobody calls me Pinky anymore . Big Bo does . Why don 't you run along ? . Me and the little lady here have a lunch date . I 'll see you in town , Erin . Big Bo ? . You gotta be kidding me ! Come on , Erin . Give me another chance . Hey . Hey , dude ! What the hell ? . ( S. Hawk ) Never touch another man 's horse . You must be lost , white man . You , uh , you Leonard Screamin ' Hawk ? . Who 's askin ' ? . Duff Daniels . Holy lnspired Church of Christ . Snake wranglers ? . That 's right . I 'm in the market for some very- - specialized products . Come on , Officer . What are you ? . Parks and Rec ? . A nosy ranger ? . No , no . I 'm cool . Hell , I 'm one-tenth Cherokee . One-tenth ? . Tell me , white man , what kind of products are you lookin ' for ? . Specifically , some , uh , Carolina pygmies . I 've been to every wrangler in town . They all say you 're the only one who has ' em . Carolina pygmies , huh ? . Very deadly snake . Well , that 's kind of the point . This way . How many pygmies do you want ? . Just a couple . Fifty bucks each . You should really stop by the church some time . We 'd welcome you with open arms . Your faith is an insult to nature 's power . Now , what 's this ? . That--is called " Unteka . " Killed a lot of my people . Unteka ? Why have I never heard of this ? . Because my people are brave enough and strong enough to have killed them all . Almost all . You 're telling me this little guy did all that killing ' ? . Unteka grows a lot- - and very quickly . If it 's so deadly , how come you don 't just kill it ? . To have Unteka is to have great power . It is a symbol of pride to my people . Yeah , but isn 't that a Iittle risky ? Not if you observe the rules : it is harmless . What rules ? . What does it matter ? . Prr . That 's what I thought . You 're making this stuff up . There are three rules . First , never let Unteka out of the jar . Second , never let it eat anything living . And finally , never fear the heart of the snake . Alright . Alright , you sold me . I 'll give you , uh , 50 bucks for it . You 're making a mockery of my ancestors . Okay , er , 75 . Unteka is not for sale ! It has been a plague on the land for centuries . A curse from an angry god ! Fine . Fine , 85 bucks , but we 're talking blood from a stone here . [ phone rings ] Stupid white man . It is not for sale ! Take your snakes and go ! ( S. Hawk ) Oh , hi , babe . Yeah , I know . Okay . Well--yeah , okay , I have the bill right here . Thanks for taking the ambulance back , partner . ( Faye ) Sure . Les ? . If you feel lonely , me and friends are goin ' out for drinks . Oh , thanks , I don 't feel much like having a drink . Well , if you just want to talk , I 'm always up late . Call me . Thanks . [ dog whimpers ] Hey ! [ whistles to dog ] [ softly ] Bow wow ! Bow wow ! Hey ! What the hell is that ? . ( Duff ) That ? That is the newest addition to the family . Les , meet Unteka . Unteka , meet Les . Unteka , you say ? . Mm . It 's an extremely rare , extremely deadly , extremely awesome snake . It killed a whole bunch of Indians . Yeah , only the truly wise and powerful men can possess it . Y eah , well , no snakes in the house . Don 't make me tell Ma . Duff , put it away . You big baby . Come on . Lucky someone here is wise and powerful enough to master the snake . Oh ! Quick ! Don 't let it get away ! Grab something from the sink in the kitchen . I 'II get it ! Did you see that thing ? . It just grew ! You crazy ? You big baby . You 're seeing things . ( Duff ) Okay , all right . I got it , I got it . ( Erin , recorded ) This is Erin . Leave me a message . I 'II get back to you . Thanks . [ beep ] ( Les ) Hey , Erin . It 's Les . Again . Um , it 's about ten o ' clock . I 'm just wondering where you 're at . You on a date ? . If you think you 're gonna make me jealous , you 're not . Come on . I know you 're there . Pick up the phone . Okay , Erin . Enough 's enough . Erin ? . [ beep ] Damn it . [ dialing ] [ snoring ] [ meow ] [ loud meowing ] What are you doing over there ? Shut up ! Stupid cat . [ hissing and meowing ] Thank you ! [ soft clucking ] [ loud clucking ] [ loud clucking ] Hmm . Hmm ? . [ loud clucking ] [ one loud cluck ] [ thunder ] [ one loud cluck ] You little rascal . Come on out now . [ gasp ] Oh ! Oh , Lord ! [ loud cluck ] Oh , Becky ! Oh , Becky ! [ cluck ] Becky , oh my Lord ! [ hissing ] [ explosion and scream ] [ hissing ] [ hissing ] [ hissing ] [ cheerful chatter ] Hey . Hi ! Where is everybody ? . Canceled . What do you know ? . Hm . ( Les ) So it 's just the two of us . I for one , prefer intimate gatherings . What can l get you ? . Uh , anything cheap and domestic . How about a toast ? . To what ? . New beginnings . [ laughter ] Hey , can I ask you a question ? . What 's so wrong about dating ? . Casual , fun , free . You 're preaching to the choir . Marriage and kids ? . You gotta be kidding me . Yeah . We got our whole lives to grow up . We should be young ! Yeah ! Impulsive ! Whoa ! Mmm . I have to tell you , I always thought you and I were doomed . Yeah ? . Why is that ? . She 's so sweet , friendly and perfect . It makes me want to puke . Yeah ? . Yeah . Sounds horrible alright . ( Bo ) What do you feel like having ? . ( Erin ) Whatever you are . Look at us ! Having a few beers in the night . And where 's sweet little Erin ! [ Les Iaughs ] Les ? . Huh ? . What ? . Whoa ! Hey , Erin ! What , uh , what are you doin ' here ? . I 'm buying the lady a drink . Got a problem with that ? . I see you 're rebounding well . Yeah , I see you 're doing the same . So , you and , uh , Dudley Do-Right are gonna live happily ever after . Well , Bo happens to be a very sweet mature man , something that you know nothing about . Ooh . And I Iike him very much . Whatever . Well said , darling . Whoa ! Two more of these , please . Somebody let the tiger out , [ roar ] Come here , baby . Sure . Come here , Bo . Let 's just get out of here , come on . [ smack and sigh ] Wow ! Damn ! Give me a ride , cowboy ? . Yeeha ! Let 's have another one of those . Get off of me . What ? . [ bell ringing distant ] [ whistles as to call something ] Unteka . [ calls whistling ] Come here , little fella . [ hissing ] Whoa , how 'd you get so big ? alright . Come on . In you go , fella . ( mother ) Duff . Duff . [ hissing ] Whoa ! Geez ! [ groan ] Just stay in here and try not to eat anything . Duff . Duff . ( Les ) Oh no . Good to see you too . We didn 't , uh- - What ? . Get piss-drunk and screw for hours under the moon ? . Yeah , that . No . You wouldn 't shut up about Erin . Oh , I 'm sorry . Mm . Don 't be . It was sweet . In a pathetic kind of way . The least I can do is buy you some pancakes . I guess that will have to do . [ siren ] No way ! Erin ? . I got a report of an abandoned vehicle . I guess it wasn 't abandoned after all . Uh , this looks bad but you have to trust me on this . Nothing happened . You 're a real pig , Les . What ? . You let Big Bo cram his tongue down your throat ! That 's all I did ! That 's all that happened here ! You must think I 'm real stupid , huh ? . [ sigh ] Mr. Patterson ! Mr. Cooley ! I got a question about killin ' ! You said something about killin ' ? . Now don 't listen to a word that son of a bitch says . You wanna know about killin ' , you ask me . It 's about killin ' snakes . Belly crawlers are a particular specialty of mine . You couldn 't catch a snake if it had two tails on it ! I could catch more than you ! Like hell you could . Please ! This ain 't your average snake . It 's an Unteka . Y 'all heard of it ? . A long time ago . Never seen one though . Nobody has . Just some injun spook story . Like the boogie man for little injun kids . What 's the story ? . A big monster snake that supposedly ate up a bunch of injun 1 00 years ago . If so , if somebody , and I 'm not saying it 's me , uh , were to let the snake loose , how would that person , who 's not me , go about killin ' it ? . Unless he 's full-grown , I suppose you could kill it like any other snake . You could shoot it . You could burn it . Or you could stab it right in the brain . [ hissing ] [ gushing ] Oh . [ bird cries out distant ] [ bird cries out distant ] ( Les ) T sk , tsk , yeah , yeah . Bow wow , bow wow . Good girl . You 're drinking ? . Yeah . So ? . What happened to heaven and hell ? . It 's been a pretty rough day , okay ? . What 's wrong with you ? . Oh , you know , snake troubles . Ah , sorry , dude . Where 's Ma ? . Mm . Out having fun , I guess . Shouldn 't you be out with Erin ? . Yeah , well , girl trouble . We should get some more beers . ( Les ) Oh , God , and her eyes , don 't get me started on her eyes . Erin 's got the most beautiful blue eyes . Yeah , her eyes , her smile , her hair ! Yeah ! Yeah ! I think we 've heard all we want to hear about the late great Erin Seymour . If you love her so much , why don 't you just marry her ? . ( man at bar ) Yeah ! What 's the matter ? It 's ' cause he 's afraid . Shut up . Yeah . He 's afraid of getting married . Afraid of movin ' out of his mama 's house . Afraid of snakes . Afraid of everything . I said shut up ! [ groan ] ( man at bar ) Ten bucks on the little guy ! You 're on . I 've been waitin a long time for this . Yeah ? . Me too . I 'll whup you like Dad never got to . ( thin man at bar ) Say ! You 're boss ! Get him in the Adam 's apple . [ loud thud ] [ groan ] [ all groan ] ( Les ) Geez , man . ( Duff ) Les , I 'm sorry . Son of a- - You okay ? You alright ? Alright ! Ow ! That 's it . Come here . Look what you done ! ( Les ) Sorry , man . ( thin man at bar ) Get outta here ! Come on ! Go on home so you can sober up . Break it up ! Come on ! Hey ! Hey ! I 'll take you on right now ! Come here ! Leave him alone . Back off . Turn me loose and I 'll show those punks ! Teach them a lesson to spill my drink . You boys get on home now , you hear ? . Hey ! Where you goin ' ? . I 'm not drivin ' . How am I gonna get home ? . Walkin ' ! That 's not fair , man . Come back here ! [ thunder ] [ dog growls ] [ dog whimpers and snake hisses ] Erin ! Erin ! Sorry . You were right . You were right . Ah . Oh , yeah . Mm . [ chuckles ] [ shooting and sirens over TV ] [ hiss ] Huh ? . [ hissing ] [ Duff shouts in horror ] [ shouts ] [ muffled ] I don 't wanna die ! I 'm too young ! Erin . Hey . I was--I was waiting for you . God , you 're a wreck . Yeah , um , I know you 're mad at me , and I understand what all " that " must have looked like , but , l--it doesn 't matter . The point is I--I- - I realized something , last night . Or , had pounded into my head , that I , um- - What ? . ( Bo ) Can 't handle your liquor ? Just go . No , uh- - Y eah . I 'll , uh , talk to you later ? . Les , wait . Here . T ake this with you . I just thought you might want your stuff back . Yeah . Thanks . [ whistles to dog ] Duff ? [ clock chimes softly ] Duff ! Mama ! Duff ! Mama ! Mama ! Duff ! Mama ! [ creak ] Oh my God . [ female voice over radio ] Hey . Hey , Erin . I 'm so sorry . Does anybody know what happened ? . No , they haven 't found any bodies so there 's still hope . No , they gotta be dead . There 's so much blood . They looked around the house , and all the animals are gone . What ? . Your cat , the dog , every hen . ( Bo ) They 're gone . Pardon me , lover , I apologize for not paying much attention to your life earlier , but I need to know what exactly did you do last night ? . What do you mean ? . Easy , Bo . What I mean is , I find you on my girlfriend 's porch , sunny side drunk , bloody knuckles , torn clothes . Looks a little fishy , that 's all . That 's enough , Bo ! I was at the bar . And what about the blood ? . Well , me and Duff , we kind of fought . And now he 's dead . What , you- - ? . Are you saying I killed my family ? . I didn 't say it . You did . Oh , okay , then Sherlock , who killed all the chickens ? . Oh , I don 't know , the cat ? . Oh , then who killed the cat ? . The dog ? . Then who killed the dog ? . No , don 't tell me , I did that too ! That 's a formal confession . I 'll need to get my tape recorder . You can be a real ass . Les , wait ! Don 't listen to him . I believe you . Last time I saw him , we fought . I 'm gonna have to live with that the rest of my life . [ sigh ] Come on . Let 's go . ( Les ) I just can 't believe someone in town could 've done this . ( Erin ) Maybe it wasn 't a person . What do you mean ? . It could 've been an animal like a bear , or cougar , maybe . No , there 'd be bodies , or- - parts at least . Whoa ! [ man gasps ] My goats ! My goats ! What is it ? . You folks won 't believe this . My goats . My goats . See ? I told you . Look . My goats ! Oh , God . It smells awful ! Yesterday , I had 20 of the finest goats you could ever find . And today I 've got- - I don 't know what the hell I 've got . Not much . What the hell are these things ? . Remains . Blood , bones , hair . Where 's it all coming from ? [ bleating ] One 's still alive . That 's Gerty ! Come on ! Oh my God ! What the hell happened to her ! Put her out of her pain ! I don 't- - [ bleats ] Whoa ! You gonna shoot her ? . Why ? . You want to do it ? . No . We can 't just let it suffer . ( Les ) These things , where could they be coming from ? Any animal could do it if it was big enough . What kind of animal ? . Well , this might sound crazy but , snakes could . Snakes ! ? . When they swallow their prey , they lay dormant and allow their food to digest , and whatever they can 't digest , bones , hair , teeth , they regurgitate . They puke it up . Yeah . And then they go looking for something else to eat . What kind of snake would eat a whole herd of goats ? I got your call , sweetie . What the hell happened down here ? . I don 't know , but something 's killed Getty 's goats . Does anybody know what that something might be ? Not yet . I 'd like to hear what Mr. ambulance driver here has to say about what 's going on . Well , I think it could be- - a snake . I 'm sorry , I think I misheard you . You said you think a snake 's done all this ? . Yeah , I did . Your family 's dead , you have a motive . Circumstantial evidence all over your knuckles . No alibi , say mountain lion , wolf , something . But snake ? . I think he might be right . I 'm gettin ' sick and tired of hearing all about this snake stuff . Why don 't you come with me ? You 're under arrest . What ? What are you doin ' ? . ! Until I find out what 's goin ' on around here , I 'm gonna keep a close eye on this one . Bo , wait ! I ain 't waitin' fer nothin ' , Erin ! ( Les ) Listen to me , you idiot . You 're making a big mistake ! You got no charges here ! I gave you the right to remain silent . Fer God 's sakes , won 't you use it already ? . Listen . You gotta listen to me . Now , more people are gonna start dyin ' here ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . You arrogant redneck bonehead ! Listen to me ! There 's no shower in here ! ( Mom ) Okay , you pick one now . [ children laughing ] Dad ! James keeps buggin ' me ! Derek , don 't be a wuss . James , don 't play dirty . Hey , come on , cut it out . [ radio makes strange noises ] Cheap Chinese piece of crap . ( Mom ) Hey , guys ! Cut it out ! Go wash up for dinner . [ gasp ] Kaylee , get the boys and get in the car . Why ? . Do it now ! [ gasp ] Derek ! James ! Get in the truck ! Hurry up ! Mom , why ? . Get in the car ! Cool . Go ! You are not gettin ' my family ! Alright , bring it on ! This one 's for the good old red , white and blue ! Come on ! [ shouting ] No no ! Ah ! Ah ! Ahhh ! ( James ) Dad ! Dad ! [ everyone screaming ] Get back ! No ! No ! [ crying ] [ gentle lapping of waves ] [ siren ] Bo , I 'm glad you 're here . Something 's happened to the Jensen family . The campsite 's been abandoned . Maybe they 're hiking . No . The glass , it 's shattered and there 's blood all on in the inside . Hmm . Maybe they wrecked their jeep and , uh , went lookin ' for help . Not likely . They were probably hiding from somebody or some thing that was trying to attack them . Something ? . Like a bear ? . No , look at these . There 's bite-marks . Long narrow teeth . And they 're in pairs . So whatever we 're looking for , it only has two teeth ? Like a snake . Or maybe even a vampire ! [ laughs ] [ car honks ] Now , Bo , do tell me . What 's the big emergency ? . Well , it seems we have a real problem on our hands . I see you have . Yeah , but the boys and I are all over it . Ha . Sure you don 't need some bigger guns ? . Maybe I oughta place a call to the city . No , we can handle this . I swear it . Any idea what you up against ? . Mr. Kornferry , I know this is gonna sound crazy , but I think we have a giant snake on the loose . You say we have a what now ? . A snake . No , I 'm serious . We should alarm the whole town . Maybe even call off the county fair . Cancel the fair ? . It 's only a day away . Sir , I have a PhD. in zoology , and I know a lot about animals . Snakes in particular . And this is definitely the work of a giant snake . Right . Some magically disappearin' monster snake ? . Okay , that 's enough . You 're embarrassing yourself now . No , I know about snakes . They hunt in three ways . Smells in the air , vibrations in the ground and heat . If there is a giant snake out there , that country fair is gonna be one big dinner . The fair is the biggest exhibition of the year . It 'll be a bloodbath . Okay , you 're officially in charge of hunting the phantom snake . You gather your boys and find out whoever did this or whatever did this ! I know what I 'm talking about ! Simmer down , little britches ! Nobody is listening to me ! You just let Big Bo take care of this . If you 're afraid of that big bad snake , then you just stay out of the woods , little darlin ' . Come on , mayor ! There you go . [ birds calling , wood creaking ] [ wood cracks ] Hello ? . Somebody there ? . ( female voice ) Where should I put this ? ( Bo ) [ indistinct ] This one ? . The one on the bottom . [ Les , whisper ] What are you doing here ? . Getting you out of here before Big Bo finds out . Why ? . Because you 're the only one who believes me . I 'm the only one who believes you . So we might as well do this together . What about Big Bo ? . This snake is a lot bigger than Big Bo . Bo , can you look at this ? . Bo ? . Yeah . You know , Faye , you have , uh , lovely eyes . Bo , you 're not lookin at my eyes . What about Erin ? . What about her ? . I thought you two were together now . She was all over you at the bar . Erin , little miss perfect , she 's a tease . I 'm a man , Faye , and men have needs . Whoa ! What the hell is that ? . It 's a snake skin . That 's a snake skin ? . I found it about a mile up the river from the latest killing . Do you know how long it is ? . Yeah , too damn long ! Thirty feet . Wonderful . Do you want to know the bad news ? . Badder than a 30-foot snake ? . Yeah . It 's growing . This snake 's gonna get bigger ? . By the looks of these marks , it 's growing fast . What kind of snake could grow this big this fast ? . I don 't know . And I know snakes . So whatever it is , it must be extremely , extremely rare . Extremely rare , extremely dangerous , extremely awesome snake . Uh , it 's something my brother said to me before he--disappeared . I don 't get it . See , I know it 's gonna sound crazy , but the day before my brother--died , he brought this thing home . A snake in a jar . He said it was extremely rare and dangerous . When that jar broke , I swear that snake doubled in size . You gotta be kidding . There was something different about that snake . Know where it came from ? . No , he just kept it in this disgusting little jar . Do you still have it ? . No , I threw it in the trash . I 'll bet you it 's still there . Come on , it might give us some clues . ( officer ) Bo ! What the heck are you doing ? . Can 't you see I got my hands full here ? . You better come take a look at this . [ sigh ] Alright . I don 't get it , Bo . I thought you said there was no snake out there . Oh , shut up . Whoa , that 's big . Ick . Les is gone . I just checked . Oh , son of a- - I thought somebody was watching the cell . Yeah , somebody was supposed to be . We aren 't really going out to catch this thing , are we ? . Maybe it 's time to call in the cavalry . Break out the shotguns and gas up the ATVs . We got ourselves a big-ass snake to kill . [ engines running loud and fast ] ( Bo ) Oh , Christ . It 's shedding more skin . That means it 's still growing . ( officer without hat ) I hope not . What the hell is that ? . Oh , it 's what 's left of the Jensen family ! ( Bo ) How can this thing be eating so much ? . ( officer with hat ) Come on , guys . Let 's get out of here . [ scream ] ( officer without hat ) Bo , watch out ! [ screams ] ( Bo ) [ gasping ] No ! No ! Bo ! [ much gasping ] Oh , G- - Oh , God . [ screaming ] [ Bo sobbing ] [ sobbing ] Help me ! [ shouts with echo ] Somebody , please help me ! [ shrieks ] [ sobs ] Please help me . Help me ! [ shrieks with pain ] [ dog barking ] What in the hell- - ? . Wait for me ! Hey , slow down . Who 's out there ? . I 'm over here . Please help me . please . It 's late and I 'm drunk . You better have a damn good excuse for this . Please help me . Please . What happened ? . Please help me . Oh , Christ , please help me . Come on , boy . Say it ! Snake . Snake ? . I might be half drunk , but did he say a snake did this ? . Snake . Oh . He 's dead . Snake . That 's what I was afraid of . That 's what it sounded like to me . You okay ? . Yeah , I just don 't know if I can do this . What ? . I haven 't been here since- - I just don 't know if I can see that again . We gotta get that jar . [ Les sighs deeply ] Okay , where are we going ? . The kitchen . Now he had the snake on the table there . And it broke down there , which means it 's gotta be back here somewhere . Probably--right here . Look . Yeah , that 's it alright . Check this out . What 's it say ? . I don 't know . Some sort of native North American symbols . [ creaking footsteps ] ( Les ) Patterson ! Lester , long time no see . Yeah , what are y 'all doing here so late at night and- - so heavily armed ? . Huntin ' snakes . You saw the snake ? . Not us . Big Bo . But he didn 't live long enough to tell . He 's dead ? . ! Extremely . Folks in town said something fishy is going on up at your place . We just thought we 'd come and have a look around . You 're gonna want to take a look at this . Day before he died my brother brought a snake in a jar . It was different . It grew real big real fast . Unteka . Exactly ! Unteka ? . That 's what Duff said . There 's symbols on the jar . Y 'all know what they mean ? . Lemme see that . Recognize it ? . It 's Native . Kitawa . What 's that ? . Cherokees . Great warriors . Lots of legends . Y 'all know any Kitawa around here ? . One , but he 's a real hard-ass . I suppose you know where we can find him . ( Erin ) This can 't be it . I got a feeling it is . ( Les ) Hello ? . Hello ? . Hello ! I don 't think anybody 's here . Jeez . ( S. Hawk ) Who are you ? What are you doing in my shop ? . Are you here to steal from me ? . No , no , look , I got this . The jar ! It 's broken ! Why did you break the jar ? . I didn 't . That was my brother . That--Doug ! Duff Daniels ! Duff . That slow-witted , half-minded- - Yeah , he 's dead . So it 's already eaten something living too . Well , it gets worse . How much ? . A whole hell of a lot . ( Cooley ) How big you figure that sonuvabitch is ? According to legend , 70 feet . Seventy feet ? . Are you serious ? . This ain 't gonna be enough . Well , I 'm fresh out of dynamite and plutonium . There 's gotta be something else . I got something . Yeah ? What ? I just hope you ain 't too attached to that there grill . ( Les ) They got a bunch of guns down at the police station . ( S. Hawk ) Guns ? . ! One cannot kill Unteka in flesh . One must kill him from within . Right . How exactly does one kill him from within ? . One must not fear the heart of the snake . Alright . What the hell does that mean ? . As much as it needs flesh and blood , it needs fear . It strengthens it , gives it power . It is the body he eats , but it is the fear he devours . That 's just a bunch of mystical mumbo jumbo . Maybe , but it makes sense . Think how snakes hunt . Through smells , vibrations and heat . When your body reacts to fear , it gives off signals that would attract a snake . Only when you are without fear , can you kill the snake 's heart . One cannot kill Unteka in flesh . One must kill him from within . So you 're saying your ancestors actually went inside the snake . You 're out of your mind , let 's get out of here . Wait , it makes complete sense . Snakes use venom , fangs and constriction to subdue their prey . To keep it from running away before they can swallow it . If you don 't fear the snake , it can swallow you whole . And then you could kill it from within . Yeah ? . I feel that sonuvabitch is here somewhere ! Maybe we should draw him out . Yeah , play something different . What do you want to hear ? Something with a heap of bass in it . Something I wouldn 't mind dying to . Do it , boy . Y eah , that 's right . So are you gonna help us kill it ? . ( S. Hawk ) My people , the Kitawa , have hunted and destroyed the great snakes . My grandfathers and their grandfathers protected these lands .

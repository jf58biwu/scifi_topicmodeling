 Previously on Journeyman : I can 't find Dan . I woke up this morning and he wasn 't there . He didn 't show up for work , he missed the deadline , he hasn 't called , and this just isn 't like him . What 's today 's date ? October 6 . What year ? 1987 . Where have you been , Dan ? I have been here . Here ? Here in this house ? In this city ? Katie said you disappeared for a couple days and didn 't know it ? Something like that . And you went back in time ? I saw Livia . JACK : Livia 's been dead for like nine years . Do I know you ? Not yet . There 's a facility in Auburn I know is good . Auburn is for drug users . Yeah . DAN : Katie , I told the truth , that I go on these trips ... Through time ... Go ahead , you can say it out loud . They found the plane in the water , but not your body . Dan ... So did you even get on that plane ... Yes . or am I just talking to a ghost ? No , it 's me . Where 'd you trip to this time , Dan ? You 'd never believe me . Try me . MAN : Okay , you have to lay perfectly still . We 're going to take a few pictures , hmm ? The first is going to last about 30 seconds and the rest will get progressively longer . How are you feeling , Dan ? Fine . Now , it 's going to get a little noisy in there . You want some head phones , listen to some music ? I 'm good . ( mechanical humming ) All right , one sec . Don 't go anywhere . Yeah , funny . Hello . WOMAN : Are you on the plane ? Where are you ? KATIE : We 're just on our way to the airport now . MAN : Okay , Dan , that 's it . Honey ? Yeah ? MAN : We 're done . You 'll hear from us on Tuesday . Great . We 've got a plane to catch . Thanks . I feel so guilty . About Zack ? Yeah . It 's way too long since we 've been away without him . This trip 's for him , too . He may get a sibling out of it . I wanted to talk to you about that . ( metal detector beeping ) Step over here , sir . Put your arms up , sir . Any objects in your pockets ? No . Cell phone ? Any metal in your body ? No . Maybe it 's broken . MAN : We can check that out . WOMAN : ... and remind you that cell phones must remain off until we reach our final destination . ( sighs ) Tuesday seems too long for the MRI results . Dr. Pullen doesn 't seem too worried . You 're having severe headaches and out-of-body experiences and Dr. Pullen isn 't worried ? I left the other stuff out . You didn 't tell him about ... ? Katie , let 's start with the headaches and go from there . You 're starting to sound like you don 't believe me . I just ... I 'm wondering if we 're rushing the second child thing . I thought that 's why we were going away . This trip was planned awhile ago , you know , before ... Listen , it 's been a week and nothing 's happened . You still want to have another child with me , don 't you ? Relax . We 're going to have fun . I got to use the head . Beverage or cocktail ? No thanks . ( " Get Down Tonight " playing ) Hello , sir . You may want to return to your seat . It 's going to get a little bumpy . Hmm ... Here you go . Excuse me . What seems to be the problem ? WOMAN : It 's locked , but no one answers . MAN : Are you sure someone 's there ? ( door handle rattling ) ( knocking ) Hello ? You okay in there ? Are you all right in there ? Hello ? Can we assist you , sir ? Sir ? Don 't say anything . I 'm not supposed to be flying this late . Okay . Excuse me . This ... this woman 's in labor . Oh , my . Is there a doctor on board ? ( slurring words ) : I am . Proctology ... mostly . STEWARDESS : Cindy ... ? Uh , so what 's your name ? Diana . Diana , now I want you to take short , quick breaths . Try not to push until I see the baby 's head . Where is the father ? No , no , there 's no father . I mean , he 's out of the picture . Oh , just help me , please ! MAN : Sir , back away from the door . WOMAN : What happened ? MAN : I don 't know . May I have your name , ma 'am ? Katie Vasser . Are you flying alone ? Why ? The lady in 17-B says you 're aren 't- - she says you 're flying with a man . Well , it appears that I 'm not . It appears that the lady in 17-B is mistaken . All right . Push , Diana , push . ( screaming ) That 's it . Looks like you 've done this before . I was in the room when my son was born . You 'd have had to put a gun to my head . How we doing here ? How long before we land ? 30 minutes to SFO . There 's a lot of bleeding . The placenta may have separated from the uterus . That 's not a good thing . Is everything okay ? You 're fine , you 're fine , you 're fine . Just breathe , Diana , okay ? You may need to land this plane . Now ! ( phone dialing ) It 's Dan . Leave a message . Hey , it 's me . I fell asleep and when I woke up you were gone . So now guess what , the pilot 's turning the plane around . Honey , I really hope you get this , 'cause we have a little problem here . DAN : One more time ... now push . ( yelling ) ( baby crying ) Ladies and gentlemen , we 'll be landing a little short of our destination . And please fasten your seat belts . And it 's a girl . ( cheering and applause ) Why were you and your husband flying to Portland ? We were going to a bed and breakfast . And why is that , ma 'am ? I 'd rather not say . Ma 'am , once a person boards a commercial airliner as a ticketed passenger , they 're not allowed to leave . If your husband did , that 's a security breach . And , Mrs. Vasser , our flight manifest has your husband boarding the plane at 3 : 56 p.m. That 's right . He came on with me . I 'm-I 'm pretty sure I fell asleep when we were still on the ground . He must have ... left before we took off . Knowing Dan , it was to get caffeine . I need to ask you again- - What were your plans in Oregon ? We were going to have lots of sex . I 'm not joking around here . Neither am I. ( woman speaking French over PA ) KATIE : Hey , it 's me . I fell asleep , and when I woke up , you were gone . Sorry , Inspector , FBI has her now . I 'm not here on business . Are you the husband , Mr. Vasser ? No , I 'm her brother-in-law . Then I 'm sorry , sir . What are you doing here ? Your wife called me . What the hell is going on ? It 's a misunderstanding . Are you the husband ? Yes , I walked off the plane before it took off . I may have caused the problem . Follow me , sir . I 'm so sorry . Oh , God , babe ... We 're going to let you all go now , but we will have more questions . Of course . Here 's my card . Thanks for coming , Jack . I appreciate it . I 'll pull up the car . I 'll meet you at Departures . Should we order in ? Okay . Or we could talk about me vanishing off a 747 . Or that . Yeah . You okay ? I think so . What happened , Dan ? I delivered a baby on a plane- - a pregnant woman flying alone- - in the ' 70s . What does that mean ? I don 't know . The last time , I followed this guy through periods of his life . Maybe I 'm going to follow the mother on hers . Do you think there are other married couples having this conversation right now ? Probably not . I can 't control when I go , but I seem to come back to the present when I finish some chapter in the lives of the people that I 'm tracking . I don 't know for sure . I 'm new at this . I 'm ovulating . Okay . This is my optimum time . I knew weeks ago that this would be my best day . Katie ... Katie , this changes nothing for me . Dan , if what you 're saying is true , it changes everything . I think I 'm going to skip dinner . It 's been a long day . Hey , go home . Livia ? It 's time to get up . Why ? Why us , Liv ? Why ? Why are both of us doing this ? What year is it ? I don 't know . My phone doesn 't work here . You 're going to need an old phone . You 're also going to need expired currency , a personal ID , and don 't travel with citrus . It explodes . I don 't know why . The cars look like the ' 80s . Come on , Tanna . Can we go somewhere and talk ? There 's no time for that . Let 's make time . Who are you tracking now ? I don 't know . I don 't care . Dan . WOMAN : Come on , honey . Help Mommy . Some woman . She had a baby on a plane . Let go of me ! You have to go . I paid for these art classes . I don 't want to go today . It 's her . Sweetie , I 'm going to be late for work . Fine . I 'll go . Then get busy . Busy doing what ? What 's she going to be like as a teenager ? It 's you . You 're the man on the plane . You helped me . Oh , my God . I 've been looking for you for years . Yeah . Yeah , that was me . WOMAN : I checked with the airline . I ran ads in the paper . Some people claimed to be you , but they were all weirdoes . Well , your search is over . What do you do ? My life is dull . Let 's talk about you , your daughter . What were you two fighting about ? She wants to meet her dad . She hasn 't met him ? No . No . I never even told her who he was . Maybe it 's time that you did . I don 't know if that 's a good idea . You don 't know Trevor . The father ? Yes . Tanna ... she wants a family so bad- - a father , a sibling . I just don 't know if it 's in the cards . If you don 't tell Tanna who her father is , maybe she 'll end up resenting you . Market Street ! Everyone off for Market Street ! This is my stop . Okay . I 'd like you to meet my daughter sometime . I don 't have a phone yet , but ... I have a feeling we 'll run into each other again . All right . Well ... Hey . Did you come to bed last night ? No . I fell asleep downstairs . I had a charger for this . Have you seen it ? It was in a box of old chargers that I sold at a yard sale . Why did you do that ? 'Cause it was a box of wires that fetched two bucks . I wish you hadn 't done that . My phone doesn 't work in certain time zones . Ah , yes . Well , had I known you were going to become a , you know , time traveler ... Come on . It 's got to turn you on a little bit . It will , eventually , I 'm sure . Is it still your optimum time ? Close enough . Don 't go anywhere . Oh , we have , um , Ned and Kathy for dinner on Monday night , remember . Right . You bet . I 'll be there . You know , maybe after breakfast . I 'm starving . All right ? Okay . Want me to take a drug test ? I 'll take a drug test . Oh , you didn 't in the ... ? Morning , noon or night . I don 't care . This is very hot . You shooting up plutonium ? It 's tea . I just wanted you to know that I 'm clean and I always will be . Hey , you 're the one who went AWOL . I take my job seriously , Hugh . And I take deadlines seriously . Is it true they turned around a commercial airliner 'cause you walked off it before takeoff ? Yes . Would you say it 's worthy of a news story ? It involved an incident between my wife and myself , so my reporting on it would be a conflict of interest . You 're right . That 's why I 'm going to put Jesse on it . The kid with the blog ? Why don 't you just get him to make something up ? 'Cause I prefer he starts somewhere in the neighborhood of the truth . There 's no story there , Hugh . San Francisco International has a hole in their airport security . You walked through it . It 's a story . That was my tea . So listen , I 'm sorry for making you come down to the airport yesterday . Yeah . Let 's discuss that . You 're always there for me . I really appreciate it . I don 't want to be your first phone call anymore when you have marital problems . Wow . It 's good I came in person . It must be so much more gratifying saying that to my face . You don 't see where I 'd have a problem with this ? Jack , we broke up eight years ago . You married my brother , Kate . I can 't just shrug it off and carve the Christmas turkey . I didn 't leave you for him , and I 'm not the reason Livia died . Sorry . It 's been a strange week . How 's he doing ? He 's going through some stuff . In his " Way Back " machine ? He had an MRI . He knows it 's not that . An MRI ? Why ? He 's having these headaches . Okay . I 'll call him later . I got to go to work . ( phone ringing ) Hello . Dan , it 's Ken . Yeah , I sent the file . One question . We 're having a little trouble finding it . Do you remember where you put it ? Dan , you there ? It 's under " Callahan Press Conference . " Can I call you back ? Sure . Dan , hey , I 'm doing a story on Flight 680 . Did Hugh talk to you ? My fault . Sorry . Taxi ! Right here ! Hey . Dan and Livia aren 't home right now . Leave a message at the tone , and we 'll call you back . Bye . You wait until the playoffs ! Did you leave the door unlocked ? No . That 's strange . Don 't turn the music on . We 're watching the game . ( all laughing and talking ) Put her down ! Come on , let 's go . ! It 's almost game time ! ( macho whooping ) WOMAN : You 're not getting any tonight . Crazy ! I want it ! I want it ! Baby , what are you doing ? Come on . You make a better door than a window . Yummy . Very sexy door , but come on , kickoff 's in two minutes . That 's one more minute than you 'll actually need . Oh ! Little brother got a lickin ' . Hey . Hey , babe . So , uh , Jack and I had a scare last month . Really ? So did we . Really ? Yeah . Shh . Oh , come on . They 're watching football . A bomb could drop . Did Dan freak ? Are you crazy ? I didn 't tell him . Why not ? I don 't know . Because then Dan would want to get married and it 'd be for the wrong reasons . Sometimes Dan rushes into things without thinking them through . And then he blames you when everything goes wrong ? Exactly . Anyway , I don 't know if I 'm cut out to be a mom . Why ? ( pager beeps ) Oh , shoot . It 's work . I bet I have to go in . Hey , it 's me . Sure . Okay , I 'll be right there . Four-alarm fire in China Basin . I gotta go . Honey , sorry , I 'm gonna need a ride . Can you take a cab ? Don 't be an ass . All right . Sorry . Next time . Bye . Bye , Dan . Bye . Bye . ( chuckles ) Looks like we 're alone . You and me . ( giggling ) Show you how to do that ? ( giggling ) : Yes . You waiting for someone , too ? Yeah . My dad . I 'm not gonna wait much longer . This was a bad idea . It 's over . I think they 're coming out . You all right ? This isn 't gonna go very well . Oh , my God , I think that 's him . I can 't do this . Do it . Trevor ? Yes ? Someone wants to say hello . Hi . My name 's Tanna Bloom . My mom was Diana Bloom . She used to be your secretary and she gave birth to me 30,000 feet over Lake Tahoe . I 'm your daughter . I 'll catch up . What do you want ? To tell you that Mom died . She had a rare congenital heart defect . I 'm sorry . She told me a lot about you guys , about how you were meant to be together , but your father didn 't want you to marry the hippy . Who 's this ? I don 't know . I 'm just waiting for someone . Mind doing it someplace else ? Yeah , I do . So is this about money ? No . I have a job at Dixon Graphics . I 'm gonna be an artist . I just wanted to meet you because right now ... I 'm all that 's left . Well , look , Tanna , your mother and I , it was a one-night thing , okay ? She got pregnant , she claims I was the father . I gave her ten grand and told her to move back home . I don 't know why she told you all the fairytale stuff . Part of the deal was , she wasn 't supposed to tell you who I was , and I 'm sorry for you she didn 't keep her end of the bargain . Her name was Diana . Uh ... here . Buy some art supplies and good luck . Hey , hey . Wait , wait . Tanna ? ( sobbing ) Hey ! ( boy laughs ) Put me down ! No way . Hey , I tried calling your office , the cell . I was in a bad cell area . Oh . You okay ? Yeah . Had a lot on my mind . Work stuff . The salad fork goes on the outside . Sorry . It 's okay . The spa has a room for this weekend if you want to try again , but my sister can 't take Zack . You won 't be ovulating . Does that matter ? Salad fork on the outside . The forks ... You packed the birth control last time . You weren 't planning on getting pregnant . On the plane , I said I was having second thoughts . I told you that . I think what you 're telling me is you don 't have too much confidence in this marriage lasting . What ? ! That 's not it at all . I gotta go . Where ? Mustang 's ready . Did you forget why it 's in the shop ? Dan , you can 't drive . I 'll take surface streets . I 'll go slow . If I feel a headache , then I 'll pull over . We have people coming over for dinner in an hour . I 'll be there ! Dan ! ZACK : Are you guys fighting ? No , sweetie , we 're just talking . ( phone rings ) JACK : Hello . DAN : Hey , it 's me . I need a favor . What now ? You in Guantanamo ? Katie and I want to go away this weekend and I was wondering if you could watch Zack . Watch your kid ? Watch your nephew , yeah . He should know his uncle a little better . You run this by Katie ? She 'll be okay with it . All right , I got to see what I got going on . Hey , Katie said you had an MRI ? Yeah , it 's nothing . Listen , can I call you back ? I got to take this call . KATIE : Hi . You 've reached the Vassers . Leave a message . Damn ! Hey , uh , yeah , I think I 'm gonna be late for dinner . Hey , is this plane sold out ? Yes , sir . You want to join the Mile High Club ? Can I ask you something ? If I am here for a reason , if I 'm following someone , why are you here ? I don 't know . Take your seats , please . I don 't have a seat . Take mine . Where are you gonna sit ? I don 't need it . Take it . It 's me , isn 't it ? You 're following me . Maybe . I don 't know . God , if you 'd just once answer me . You don 't think this is hard for me , Dan ? You don 't think I have a thousand questions ? Go ahead . You can ask me anything . When did you get married , Dan ? Saw the wedding ring on your left hand . Who 's the lucky woman who got my fianc \ ? You don 't know . All I know is I never wanted to leave . Leave where ? Where did you go when you left that plane ? Where do you live now ? When do you live ? STEWARD : People , please , I need you to sit down . Take my seat . You won 't be sitting next to a stranger . STEWARD ( over P.A. ) We 're beginning our descent into San Francisco . The pilot has turned the seat belt sign back on . Please fasten your seat belts at this time and put your seat backs and tray tables in their full upright and locked position . Trevor Mason . I met you at a mortgage conference last year in San Francisco . What happened to the woman who was sitting here ? Oh , she wanted a window seat so we switched . You okay ? Just dandy . MAN : Dixon Graphics . I 'm looking for Tanna Bloom . She just left . Do you know where I might find her ? She just got paid . Try Dave 's bar . The Tenderloin . Thanks . Whoa ! What 's this ? What ? This is counterfeit . No , no , it 's just , um ... This isn 't even good counterfeit . It 's all I got . I 'll have to get back to you , all right ? Hey , wait ! Whoa ! Whoa ! ( horn blares ) Tanna ? Hey , dude . Back of the line . I just flew into town with your father . He 's not well . You 've got a father ? I don 't have a father . Yeah , you do . He has leukemia , Tanna . He 's here for treatment , but he doesn 't have long . Karma , meet Daddy . Daddy , meet karma . His only chance is a bone marrow transplant . He needs a donor . Listen , you just tell him that his daughter said to go to hell . Yeah . I doubt he 'll care . I doubt he thinks about you at all . Don 't drink your entire paycheck . Try and save something for food . Hey , why don 't you leave her alone . I 'm trying to help her . You 're trying to get her to buy you drugs . Hey , okay . Relax . ( grunts ) : Hey , man ! What you doing , partner ? Hey ! I want to say good-bye to this jerk . You know where he is ? Yeah . Get in . Going south on ... Hi . Can I help you ? Trevor Mason . Down to the right there . Thought I was nervous the first time I met him . Who are you looking at ? My old man . You 're the guy from the plane . This is your daughter , Tanna . Do you remember her ? What the hell is going on here ? I heard I have something you might want . I don 't want anything from you . Who said you 're getting it ? I mean , I don 't expect anything from you . I sure as hell wouldn 't help me if I were you . Yeah , well , we 're not the same person . So how do they do these transplants ? Well . Uh ... they stick a big needle in your hip and suck out the bloody pulp and give it to me . It 's supposed to hurt like hell . I wouldn 't do that even if I loved you . Hey . Can I buy you a coffee ? I don 't know . This is pretty good . The test to see if I 'm a match ... that isn 't painful , right ? I don 't know . Don 't think so . Then maybe I 'll do it . What ? Why ? Because I take after my mom . Not big on flying , actually . Me , either . I hated it . That 's why I went for my pilot 's license . The whole conquer - your-fear thing ? Yeah . So I earn my pilot 's license and it 's the big C that gets me . Anybody for irony ? Yeah , there seems to be a lot of it going around . Yeah , well , Fate never comes through the front door . Amen . Billy Marble . Dan . It 's good ice cream . Right when you get your appetite back , that 's when they hit you with the poison again . So where you from , Da ... ? ( sighs ) I 'm sorry . It 's okay . We 'll put dinner parties and operating heavy machinery on the " No Can Do " list . As hard as this is for me , it must be harder for you . I can 't forget that . It 's okay . No . No , it 's not . Listen , I 'm sorry . I 've been pushing the second kid . You 're right , now is not the time . It 's hard enough for me to hold onto the family I do have . Dan . We 're not going anywhere . How are you doing ? I wish I knew . Heyl I know you ! You 're the guy that brought me to the hospital to see my dad . Yeah . You haven 't changed at all . Neither have you . Oh , God , please tell me I have . All right , you have . Uh ... I 'm sorry I ... uh ... I didn 't follow up . How 'd it go ? Uh ... I wasn 't a match . He died in ' 96 . Well , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . You want to walk ? Sure . Hey . I did match someone . Really ? Mm-hmm . Another patient at the hospital . Billy Marble . I met him . How is he ? He 's doing great . He 's flying humanitarian missions to Darfur or something . You know the deal . Stares death in the face , changes his life . Sounds like he , uh , stays in touch . He better . I saved his damn life . Maybe you helped a little . ( chuckling ) You heading out now ? Yup , I 'm late . Plane leaves in an hour . This another attempt at Operation Second Child ? No . You need help with that ? Because you don 't seem to be getting it done . What can I do for you ? Jesse talked with the airline . They say they have security footage of you boarding the plane at the gate and not coming off . Okay . So , he 's gonna call you . He has my number . Six kids , Dan . Six for six . I 'm just saying . Vassers , Flight 124 to Portland . Uh ... One moment , sir . Excuse me . I 'm sorry . Mr. and Mrs. Vasser ? Mm-hmm . We have you on a no-fly list . Can I ask you to step to the side , please ? Folks , I need you to step to the side . Mendocino 's an hour away . Did I tell you I got the results back from the MRI ? There 's nothing wrong with me .

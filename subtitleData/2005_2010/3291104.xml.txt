 " Suicide Note " Michino . What happened after you left with her last night ? What do you mean ? Don 't play dumb ! What did you do with the girl , Miki ? Well , she said she 'd miss her train so she left me ... What ? I didn 't leave you two alone for no reason ! What were you doing ? Hey , what are you doing ? Hey . What 's up ? Doi , do me a favor and knock first . Oh , sorry . Anyway , how are you doing ? Do you want something ? Sorry , but could you lend me 10,000 yen ? You mean ... again ? It 's okay , isn 't it ? You 'd be helping your neighbor out . I don 't have much . Don 't worry ... You have money ! I don 't have a lot . I 'll pay you back with 200 % interest . Holy shit ! What ! A party with the women next door ? The factory workers ? Aren 't they all old ? Don 't be silly . Look . See that one with the long hair ? She 's the kind who 's just waiting to get laid . Is she , really ? Hey , I want to get a look at her too . What ? Could I screw her , too ? If you paid her . Are you serious ? You 've got a hard on ! I haven 't ! You 're too old ! Anyway , after I screw her brains out , she 's yours . Are you sure ? What ? Do you want her too ? Shit ! She 's the kind who 's waiting to get laid . What are you doing ? It 's okay , isn 't it ? Get off me ! You 're adorable ! I 'll make you feel good . Here , here . Take your hand off ! Oh , I think I 'm in love with you . You 've got nothing else to do anyway . Let go , pervert ! You ! Who do you think you are ? You thought that you were better than me ? Do you have anything better to do ... than go home and jerk off ? Next time just go with the flow . Take a shower . All you guys stink of grease . The least you can do is smell good . Is that woman coming today ? Of course . I don 't give a shit about the other ones . We can screw her after you , right ? Why don 't you hurry up and take a shower ? See you later . Muraishi . Hi . Overtime again ? Yes , Sir . You swindler ! You 're supposed to finish on time . Right . I 'm sorry . I 'm leaving now . Lock up when you leave . I will . You 're home late . I told you to knock . Come with me ! Where to ? I 'm going to pay you back . You don 't have to . You look like shit . What happened ? What 's next ? Do you want to eat something ? Anything you like . It doesn 't matter to me . There 's a new place that 's somewhere over that way . Why don 't we take off and go somewhere else ? Let 's ditch them . These guys are boring . Who 's that ? Your girl ? Okay . Leave it to me ! But ... I ... I 'll take you where anybody can get laid ! No , I don 't want that . Don 't act like you 've never done it before . You haven 't ? Well ? Have you ? Hey . Hey . Take your clothes off . OK . I 'll help you . Well ... No ... Is it the first time ? Well , I ... I can 't do this . Sorry . Don 't worry . Come with me . Don 't ! I know you want it . Tanaka , stop it ! Be quiet , I 'll give you what you want ! Hey ! Yeah . Who the hell are you ? Yoji ? What do you want ? Leave her alone . What 's that ? What did you say ? Do you want to hit me ? You think you can fuck with me ? Tanaka ! Shut up ! Do you want more , huh ? Stop hurting him ! See you later . Are you all right ? Thank you . But I 'm really okay now . Thank you . I 'll get you a towel . OK . Thank you . Sorry . It 's OK . Thank you for what you did . I 'd better go now . Can I ... Can I ask your name ? Oh , I 'm sorry ... My name is Sachiko Misawa . I 'm Yoji ... Yogi Muraishi . I always see you eating your lunch alone . You 're always by yourself . I noticed you because you always look lonely . And I feel the same way too ... Do you ? Yes . I thought you were going to be at the party . Otherwise I wouldn 't have gone I hate those things . Well ... I 've always watched you . This way . Yoji . I have to tell you something . I have a hideous scar on my chest . You 'll be repulsed by it . Okay . Wait . Are you sure you won 't mind ? Sorry . It 's okay . What happened to you ? I have more scars . On my back , thighs and ... Do you want to see ? That bastard ... That bastard did this to me . He inflicted these scars on me when I was little , so I wouldn 't be desirable . He wanted to possess me forever . He abused me until I entered high school . Who did it ? My own father . So I finally hit him with an iron bar . Now he 's bed bound . He can 't do anything by himself . Would it be so terrible ... for me to fall in love like other people do ? I know . Tell me . Are these scars so terrible ? No , but ... I 'm sorry ... Stop apologizing so much ! Why can 't you hold me ? Why can 't you ? Why ? Help me . What is this ? Yoji ? No , not me . Yoji . It 's not my fault . It 's not my fault . Why did you take off like that ? Yoji . Yoji . Help me . What ? Where am I ? Who are you ? That 's my daughter . She was attacked by one of them . Luckily , I managed to retrieve her . But she 's still infected by the thing . Eat this . Where did you find it ? At the garbage dump . Why aren 't you infested ? Why didn 't it attack you ? It didn 't move when I found it . It didn 't move ? Fascinating . Some of them came from the deep ocean . Some of them came flying from the sky . Nobody knows what they are . Are they artificially built or naturally spawned ? Whatever they are , they 're here to do one thing . To eat each other . They occupy humans and then kill each other . When the host is worn out , they find another host immediately . They use us like tools . Like pieces of machinery . Living in the silver sphere is the parasite . From the sphere ... they control the host 's nervous system like a robot . They can also mutate the host 's organs ... and use them as weapons . They operate the host to fight . The winner of the fight eats the loser . They don 't stop until one of them is eaten alive . They are attracted to people with negative thoughts . Those who are psychologically disturbed ... and traumatized . They can sense negative emotions and are drawn to them . Whatever pain they feel or experience is channeled ... directly to the host 's nervous system . The person infested feels all the parasite 's feelings . It 's a living hell . Furthermore ... They can retrieve the host 's memory . And use the memory . If they are indeed parasites , I must say ... that there are no other parasites designed ... as perfectly as them . Sachiko ... What did you do to her ? Sachiko ? Oh , that one . Is there a way to save her ? No . Because the parasite 's fully developed . If you really want to save her kill her as soon as possible . Why can 't you hold me ? You find me repulsive ? A woman with a disgusting scar . You 're just like any other man ! No ! That 's not true ... Why didn 't you help me ? Where is your father ? What are you doing here ? I told you to wait just a little ! What are you keeping in here ? I bred them . All of them are somewhat flawed . What are you doing this for ? Like I said ... They need to eat each other to survive . Which means ... that my daughter needs to keep eating them to survive . Now you know why I brought you here . I 'm going to make you infested . These ones will attack any human in their presence . They are a mutated breed . When you 're infested ... I 'll feed you to my daughter . Don 't resist . I 'm sorry but ... I 'd sacrifice the entire human race ... to keep my daughter alive . No ... I just met her . Sachiko . I have to save her . Sachiko ! Michino , move away . My God ! Do you feel the pain ? Are you still conscious ? Where is it ? Why do you have an office in a maze like this ? Mister . Are you a space man ? Are you hurt ? Should I call a doctor ? Go away ! Help me ! Help me . Sachiko ... Don 't you remember me ? It 's me . Sachiko . Whatever pain they feel or experience ... is channeled directly to the host 's nervous system . Quiet . Whatever pain they feel or experience ... is channeled directly to the host 's nervous system . The person infested feels all the parasite 's pain . It 's a living hell . If you really want to save her kill her as soon as possible . There must be a way ! There must be a way ! Please ... Stop fighting me . Sachiko ... Try to remember . Sachiko . Sachiko . It 's me . Yoji ... Yoji Muraishi . I 've been watching you too . I 've always watched you . Kill me . Kill me , please . Run ! Do it . They can retrieve their hosts memory ... They retrieve ... the host 's memory ... And use it ... My name is Yoji Muraishi . I was born August 12th ... 1983 . When I was a school boy , I dismantled ... a radio-controlled car . Mother got really angry ... Father didn 't ... My brother is brilliant and I was compared to him . Or maybe that 's just what I thought . I had no particular reason to choose my occupation . I didn 't know what else I could do ... When I saw her for the first time ... she was having trouble . She 'd dropped the laundry in the river . She changed into something but I couldn 't do anything for her ... The only thing I can do is preserve my memory ... of her and keep her alive in my consciousness . In order to do so ... I must detonate the bomb ... that I 've created inside of me ... to keep myself from being taken over . And ... I must end everything . We can safely draw the conclusion that humans have strength beyond our comprehension . I see . So this is the new vessel ? You discovered it in the last game ? Yes . The material is incredible . Just look at him . A beautifully aerodynamic body . Anything extraneous was removed for simplicity . This is the best vessel ever created . Are you telling me that we no longer require ... the " necroborgs " for the game ? That 's right . The " necroborg 's " control system was designed ... to take over the host 's mind . But it actually prohibits the potential of the vessel . What do you mean by that ? In contrast , our latest model keeps ... its consciousness intact so it can enhance ... its emotional drive to generate unknown ... weapons of unimaginable destructive force . It has the potential to turn itself ... into something unpredictably powerful . Games from now on will be thrilling beyond imagination . Sounds good . I have his opponent ready . This vessel has a special emotional connection ... with the other one . The greater their emotional bond ... the more intense their fight will be . These are the post - " necroborg " vessels of the next generation . The code name is ... Meatball Machine .

You 're frickin ' FBI . , aren 't you ? You supposed to leave this to us . What , are you , like , a CIA agent ? Well , what the hell are you ? I 'm with the berkut group . They 're making the drop . All right , i 'll go down . You stay up here and cover me . Don 't underestimate me . - You all right ? - Yeah . Not a good idea . What about you ? What 's your story ? It 's my last night at college . Can we just hang out ? Yeah $ 250,000 cash . Walking around money . Five million in bearer bonds . As requested . I 've done my part . Where 's the list ? Right , the list . Move move move ! Hurry Move move move ! This one 's still alive . Get the chopper down . I want him alive and brought to berkut . Bring it in . Copy that . bionic woman season 01episode06 He is ? Okay , excellent . Um , wait , did you mention me ? Well , what did he say ? Really ? Shut up . Yeah , tonight at 8 : 00 . Okay , all right , see you then . Guess who 's coming over tonight for tarantino movie night ? - Brennan . - Brennan . Actually , i think i 'm gonna call him . No , you are not calling him . Rule number one , let him call you . - Rule number one ? - Mm-Hmm . Come on . There are a list of rules , and they are ironclad . Oh , the list of rules . Okay , i cannot believe you read that book . It is seriously anti-Feminist . I 'm just saying calling a guy ic the kiss of death . Even if you thought you spent an incredible , meaningful night with somebody , And they follow that up with eight days of stone cold silence . What are you talking about ? The rules . Let him take the lead . Rule five . Be mysterious . Rule six . And don 't ever split the check . Rule ten . Wow . I mean , am i allowed to vote or own property ? Ha ha . I 'm trusting you and your friends to have a good night , okay ? No smoking , no drinking , no driving . And more importantly , no calling brennan . Okay , you are seriously way behind the times You should have a word with him . I understand you worked for victor booth . I also understand you have a wife . Children . The last thing you would want is for something to happen to them . What 'd you find out ? The sale is set up at the sahrawi embassy in paris . Put a team together . This is the last known photograph of victor booth . Who 's victor booth ? He 's an arms dealer , among other things . Doesn 't seem to have any permanent address . Multiple reconstructive surgeries . Uses decoys . Doesn 't get photographed , so nobody knows what he looks like . That image is eight years old . The only good thing about it is we can see the eyes . What does berkut want with him ? Killed one of my men last night . Our operative was set up as a buyer for a list we really need . Somehow victor got wind of the fact that he was berkut . He killed him and left the cash . Which was smart , ' cause the bills were traceable . We 've since learned he 's set up another buyer . Learned from who ? The cia . I thought cia and berkut hated each other . We do , but in this case , we 're forced to work together . We both need victor 's list . What 's on the list ? The identities of cia and berkut operatives . Now , intel says victor 's on his way to paris . Given the nature of the situation , Cia 's gonna insist that we send somebody in there with you . So i 'm going to paris with a cia agent . - That 's right . - Can i pick who ? This isn 't a kickball game , jaime . Well , i just thought that , you know , since time is of the essence , It 'd be good to skip the getting to know you part and just hit the ground running . Tom gilchrist and i seemed to get the job done last week . Okay , you wanna call him ? No , you go ahead . I don 't call guys . You 're missing the point , jaime . Really ? ' Cause i think i just kicked your ass . Discretion . You have to be able to neutralize the enemy in public without anyone ever seeing . Once you 're exposed to the world , you 'll lose all value as a weapon . You know what i love most ? Being referred to as a weapon . You all right ? Hi . - Tom . - Jae . Good luck . Long time . Nine days . So you ready for paris ? Yep . By the way , thanks for calling me out in this . Oh , i didn 't call you . Jonas called you . Okay , so here 's the plan . When we land in de gaulle , we gotta move fast . Oh , de gaulle , ha ha . I hate paris . If i 'm being honest , i just- - I don 't get the allure . I 've never been . You haven 't ? Oh , it 's the most romantic place in the world . You 're gonna love it . - Really . - Yeah , romantic . Yeah , my parents took me there when i was 12 . 15 churches and five museums in one day . Gun , mouth . The louvre , don 't do it to yourself . Nathan , can we concentrate on the case ? Let 's get down to it . All right , jae , you and i will take nathan to the safe house And we 'll set up shop with the rest of the cia team . Meanwhile , tom and jaime , you 're gonna assume your cover and check into the hotel . How did berkut find victor ? Last week , one of our top operatives made contact . He was killed trying to buy the list . Victor means business . The three operatives on the last list were all dead 48 hours after it was sold . And if our intel is correct , there 's over 100 names on this list . Which means we 're talking about not only american security , But the immediate safetyof over 100 men and women and their families . So if we can get those names , we can protect those people . So is the sale definitely going down tonight ? The one thing that we know for sure is it 's happening tonight . And we need to get a positive id on victor from among 200 to 300 guests . So you two have to eye make contact as many eurotrash toolbags as you can . And we 'll take care of the rest at the safehouse . All right , we bring victor into custody And we keep the list from getting into enemy hands . Let 's go do it . Sounds good . Hey , let 's keep it professional , you two , huh ? * * * * * * You ever seen breathless ? - Jean-Luc goddard ? - No . I bet you haven 't seen a single movie made before 1983 . The breakfast club ? Thanks for playing . We have some lovely parting gifts . How can i help you ? We need two rooms . I`m here with my wife As you can see , she doesn`t speak french But i`m madly in love with her . - I was in turkmenistan ... - I didn 't know you spoke french . - No , no , you go ahead . - That 's why i didn 't call . Bad service ? Who 's your carrier ? I know- - It sounds lame , doesn 't it ? No , no , it sounds really important . Well , it was important . But you understand that , right ? Saving lives , national security , that kind of thing . I mean , you 're in the game too , right ? Sure . Yeah . C 'est la vie . I gather i 'm madame lodato . Does that make me your wife or your mom ? Uh , my very chic wife . I 'm a lucky man . Oh , i almost forgot . You all right ? Yep . Look at the view ! Yeah , it 's great , right ? Well , since we 're a married couple , we should just watch tv and not have sex . That 's a great idea . I wonder if they have deal or no deal . Say it in french . Um , you know ... You don 't have to worry . I 'll ... i 'll just ... I 'll sleep on the couch . I think that 's a better idea . Yeah . Bonjour , mi ami . What 's up , jae ! Hey . - Comment c 'est va , everybody ? - Nathan . Wow , they 're not very friendly . This the french cia ? Wait till you meet their handler . All right , i installed the iris recognition software i got from my friend at ... Oh , wait , i can 't tell you where i got it , ' cause then ... No , don 't say ... - I have to kill you ... . - Because then you have to kill me . All i need to know is whether this will effectively identify victor . Jaime needs to lock on to peoples ' eyes . Once she does , the program converts the details Of the iris stromal pattern into a bit pattern , and i can cross-Reference . Once i affirm the match , I apprise agent summers So that she can determine the means to extricate the mark to the jimjam . You realize that spies don 't really talk that way . I know . It blows . I 'm just trying to bring back the cool . Anyway , if jaime meets victor 's eyes , we 'll find him . Victor 's altered his appearance numerous times . Even if victor has gone victoria , the program is airtight . Okay , this biometric technology makes photoshop look like pong . Unprecedented false rate match . Like , never . Even these geniuses can 't change their eyes . Wouldn 't be so sure about that . Alexis . Ruth . Nice work in dubai . Where 'd you find your floater ? High school sweetheart . Jaime summers , that 's a new name . How long has she been ... What is she , 12 ? How did you find her ? Happy accident . Iris recognition . I doubt your operative can get 200 captures during the cocktail party . I don 't know , our girl is pretty good . Dude , don 't ... don 't touch my stuff . There 's a lot of security , but we knew that . Yeah , packing semiautomatics outside the embassy is a pretty big deal . If they 're doing that . Are they ? They are . So what 's the embassy party for , anyway ? Environmentalists . I didn 't know environmentalists liked to party . Hey , if we i . D. Victor before 8 : 00 , croissants on me . It 's gonna be more complicated than that . I know . Just trying to lighten the mood . Jeez . Jaime ... I have to go out in the field with a clear head . If i lose focus for a second , i 'm dead . Now , i can handle that responsibility if it 's just about me . But i can 't even begin to think about screwing up and , as a result , you ... Personal relationships can compromise a mission ... Yeah , i get it . I do . I like you . I really do . Look , i think we should just be friends . Good . Good . We haven 't even had a second date . Exactly . It 's gonna be fine . Just partners executing a job . That 's right . I thought you guys said that brennan was gonna call . 'Cause he didn 't . That 's a bad sign , right ? Calm down . He 's coming over . You guys 'll hang out , we 'll watch reservoir dogs , and you two 'll hook up . The end . No , no , i don 't really wanna hook up during reservoir dogs . Okay , i guess i can make that work . Hey , becca . This is my friend annie . Hi , rebecca . It 's becca . Annie didn 't even know who quentin tarantino was . Oh , shut up . - Hey . - Hey ! Sorry , excuse me . Hopefully the receiving line 's still happening . That way we can split up and cover more ground . Victor could look like anyone , so we have ... Could you zip me up ? The drop needs to happen by 9 : 45 . We 've got to id victor before then . Security at 3 : 00 and 9 : 00 . Surveillance cameras in the grandfather clock And ugly flower arrangements . Okay , how are you getting that ? Oh , come on . What did those guys teach you at langley , anyway ? Possible target id , northwest corner . Funny , i would have said by the buffet . Shut up . Well , perhaps we can debate lithuanian tariffs another time . Mrs. Varnas is in basle tonight . Not our guy . He 's about to leave with her and it 's not even 9 : 00 yet . Okay . God . What do these euro douches have over me ? Wealth , power , dignity . Uh , no match . Plenty of targets , let 's look around . Him ? No . No way , what 's this guy , shaolin monks here . This is a great party . Why am i not there ? By the bar . Nope . No , look at his hands . They 're in the broken zipper position . Low and in front of the waist . The sign of defensiveness . Everything we have on our guy says he 's a sociopath . Cool and confident . Okay . Fernando ! Is that you ? May i help you , senorita ? That 's so good . He looks like a fernando . Not him , let 's go . No match . Sorry , i mistook you for somebody else . And it 's senora . Now ... He could be our man . He 's not a diplomat , his shoes aren 't shined , He 's not wearing a cummerbund , and his jacket 's one size too big . Ooh . Tom , you 're an ana- - Neurosurgeon , and you 're a therapist . We 're running out of time . Drinking , why not ? Let 's drink now . This is what we do at work . Do you know you 're at work ? What about him ? Yeah , how about- - Yeah , colonel sanders over here ? He looks good . That 's a rare vintage in this town . Only thing i order when i 'm in paris . Drives the french nuts . So i take it you 're not from paris . No , i just couriered a package over here this morning . Got roped into this little get-Together . It 's a rental . Catch his eye , catch his eye . Catch his eye . C 'est la vie . Come on , look her in the eye , come on . I 'm based in d . C. Uh , you ? I 'm a professor at stanford , And my husband is an art historian doing research at the picasso museum . Oh , cool . No , i 'm here for the van gogh retrospectives , actually . She 's a beautiful lady . Come on ! What are you doing ? He 's looking at everything but your eyes . Come on , casino royale . I 'm shaken and i 'm stirred , okay ? Come on . Uh , what 's your favorite picasso ? My favorite ? Well , no , i 'm focused mainly on the impressionists . Right , but as an art historian , you must have at least a passing interest in picasso . I like the blue period . Yeah , blue period rocks . Favorite , dora maar au chat . You know it ? No , i don 't . You 'd know it if you saw it . Look , when i was dropping off this package this morning , There was this piece in the secretary 's office . A picasso . But i can 't tell if it 's an original . Maybe you could , uh ... Take a look at it for me ? Well , maybe later . We just got here . Honey , let 's see it . Maybe it 's one you don 't know . Attagirl . That 's what i 'm talking about , okay . It 's close , just one flight down . Right up your alley . Thank you . Thanks . I 've got a hunch . - What are you doing ? - Just go with it . All right , there we go . Come on , we gotta get a clear shot of his eyes . Let 's do this . Right through here . First door on the left . Yes , finally . We have a match . That 's him . That 's victor . See ya . Oh , come on ! I know it 's him . We lost him . How ? He locked us in a wine vault . Getting locked in a wine vault is a cliche . And do i need to remind you that you 're bionic ? Yeah , i know , i 'm on it . I 'll call you back . Let me help . Oh , you 've been such a great help so far . Pardon me ? Honey , let 's go see that picasso . Maybe it 's one you don 't know . Um , everyone knows that 's picasso 's most famous painting . Everyone . Hey , you 're the one who went down picasso road . I was briefed in van gogh . And then you 're like , " oh , let 's just do down into this dark basement with a strange man . " Anybody can be surprised . - It 's embarrassing is what it is . - Ass ! You know , the buy is happening now . Can we just try this together ? What do you weigh , a buck ten ? Yeah , that 'll make a huge difference . - Yeah , we 'll see . Whatever . - Whatever . Thanks . But i loosened it . Whatever . Come on . Excuse me . Did you see that ? See what ? - Work with me . - Hey ! Hey ! * * * * * * merci . Excuse me . Yes . The only place we could find a little privacy .

License and registration . - You 're late . - I was detained . Okay . Hey . All right , i 'm going in alone . You 're kidding , right ? I know you can handle yourself , but this guy 's gonna be armed . You 're not ready for this . Victor 's in that room . That 's the mission . We both have to go in there . No , it 's too dangerous . We both knew it was dangerous before we came to paris . Nothing 's changed . Yes , it has ! Oh , so i 'm your trophy spy . Oh , come on ! This is harder than i thought it was gonna be . - Just hang back . - You know what ? You don 't get to corner the market on brave . We both have to go in there . You may think you 're being a gentleman , but it 's condescending . Get over yourself . - I 'll take him . - Yeah . Jaime , no ! - You okay ? - Yeah . Clear . There 's nothing on him . There 's no list . It 's not victor . It looks like him , but it 's not him . Go , now . Wait , we have to go back for tom ! There 's no time . Where is victor ? Hey , we had a lock . It 's not my fault she takes out a whole new guy . Why hasn 't tom called ? We 're trying to locate his tracking device . It says he 's still at the embassy , But the gps could have been knocked loose and left behind . He 's still there . We have to go back and just go in . Hello ? It 's sovereign territory . Just going in is not an option . Where did she come from ? You cost me quite a lot of money tonight . Who do you work for ? The metropolitan museum of art . Really ? The only reason you 're notead yet is ... I forgot . Yeah ? Can i talk to tom ? Tom , it 's for you . Tom ? I can 't believe you called me . Shut up . Are you okay ? Honey , everything 's fine . You know how much i love to hang out with the guys . Don 't worry , i 'm gonna be fine . Let me guess , you want your husband back . This is the wife , right ? Yes . Good for you . You want him back . I 'm afraid it 's gonna cost you quite a lot . I do want him back . And i also want the list . The list , really ? Really . $ 6 million . Fine . 2 million for your husband . Great . One hour . Go to the cafe sartre at the clingancourt . Three percent in cash , the rest in bearer bonds . If i see you with anyone else , i 'll cut your fake husband into real pieces . Does tom have victor ? Uh , no , reverse that . We can get tom and the list for 8 million . The drop 's in 58 minutes . What makes you think i can get $ 8 million in less than an hour ? You can 't ? I 'm not authorized to release that amount . Can you call someone who is ? Is that a yes ? Give me a minute . Whatever . We still have 57 of ' em . Can you get the money ? I know someone who can . Yeah ? Can you get me $ 8 million in , say , 45 minutes ? Okay . Thank you . Okay ? It 's for the mission , right ? No , i found this great pair of shoes . You know , being flip doesn 't engender my trust . It 's to buy the list . I 'll authorize the wire . Nathan knows the account . Thank you . Just get it done . Hi , becca . Thanks . Wait , you 're jaime 's boss ? Yeah . Oh , yeah , sorry , she said i should call you if there was an emergency . Driving without a license underage and intoxicated , i 'd say that qualifies . Well , thanks for your help , but i 'm just gonna go call one of my friends ... Whoa whoa . I 'm responsible for getting you home . On the way , we can have a little chat . - We can 't go in after tom . - What ? We 're not authorized to do any more here . My hands are tied . Your agent 's life 's on the line , and that 's your response ? This is a ghost mission now . Tom is solely accountable . He knows that 's how it works . He wouldn 't want us to put other agents lives in jeopardy . He 's compromised , jaime . What would you say if i told you i 'm gonna go in and get him ? I 'd say good for you . Who 's gonna have my back in there ? We 're gonna be with you every step of the way , okay ? Are we good ? * * * * You have a mic and earwig . We can talk to you , you can talk to us . I don 't like you in the market alone . I won 't be alone . You and jae 'll be covering me . You just can 't be with me . It 's too dangerous to tom . Jaime , berkut is allowing you to carry $ 8 million to get the list . Not to hang out with your boyfriend . I have a degree in psychology . Quit playing with that ring . There isn 't time to reinvent the plan . The list is the only reason we 're here . She can do it . $ 240,000 in cash . The rest in bearer bonds . You good ? Yeah . Drop me here . So i 'm supposed to believe my sister 's selling time-Shares ? Yeah . Well , what are the most popular time-Shares ? I 'd have to say arizona . No . No , it 's too hot . Old people like that . I mean , what is my sister doing selling them ? If i had to guess , i 'd say she 's trying to earn a decent living So she can take care of you . Great . I realize why she wanted me to call you . It 's , like , a guilt trip once removed . Sorry , i didn 't mean to lay a guilt trip on ya . I have a daughter and she 's accused me of that before . And she 's probably right , so i apologize . It 's okay . I 'm not into jaime 's list of secrets , you know ? It 's like some things she just ... Puts on this repeat loop . And then others she totally clams up about . I mean , we 're sisters . Like , okay , her fiance ? She never talks about him . And he died . I mean , that 's weird , right ? We 're family , we should be able to talk about that stuff . Yeah , you should . Are you gonna say maybe she has her reasons ? Maybe she does , you know ? Just keep walking to the center of the cafe . Fine , but i want you to ... Damn it . Hey , pretty lady . Care to join me ? Here we are , second date . Not a cheap one . How much ? $ 8 million . Oh , god . I don 't mind saying i expect you to put out . That 's very forward of you . You must be american . That looks nice on you . Don 't worry about it . It 's a cubic zirconia . No , it 's not . Okay , it 's not . I do have an expense account . So it 's a write-Off . Now you 're making me sound like i 'm not romantic . Well ... Jaime , i shouldn 't have said any of that stuff on the roof . - No , tom , i was way out of line . - It was complete crap . I didn 't mean what i said at the embassy . - You mean about me being condescending ? - Any of it . No , i shouldn 't have said any of that stuff to you . Clearly you can kick some ass . - I can . - You can . God , you 're beautiful . You realize that the minute that you put the money on the table , we 're dead , right ? Right . And if you didn 't bring any money , we 're also dead ? Yeah . - You read comic books as a kid ? - No . I did . I loved ' em . My favorite was this one called freedom fighters . There was this great character called the human bomb . My god . Whoa , bombs , no . Nobody said bombs . * * * * * Oh , great . You want an espresso ? - * * * - * * * * Good evening , i 've got a list of specials . Ala carcte Bingo , we got it . Pay dirt . Actually , i 'm not that hungry . Cafe policy , mademoiselle . You cannot sit at the table without paying . Oh , i can pay . Good . No , no , no ! Get away from me ! - How do i deactivate it ? - You can 't . Now let me check the manual . Can i look ? Give me two second- - Two seconds . No . No . It 's a solar fuse detonator . One of the leads is hot and the other two are decoys ! You pull the wrong lead ... - Are you sure ? - Yeah . It 's the , uh , black wire . I 'm sure . Yank that puppy . Wait ! Wait ! Yank it ! Lucky guess . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . Holy ... oh . All right . Stay out of the open . Watch out ! Watch out ! Watch out ! Tom ! Wh- - Where the hell did you come from ? How the hell 'd you get here ? I 'm a really fast runner . So they recovered about $ 4 million . The rest is working it 's way into the french economy . Well , i was actually carrying $ 8 million . So in a way , i got the list for hf price . Listen . Don 't just call me for money . Call for backup . This time we came out ahead . We could 've done better . I was thinking about tom . I was thinking about you . - What about the cia ? - What about ' em ? - You give ' em victor ? - Yeah . But they left tom . They abandoned him . Frankly , victor 's a lot better off with the cia . By the way , my sister didn 't call , did she ? I gave her your number . No . How did you get to victor before i did ? And ... How did you figure out the explosive device ? Don 't tell me you guessed , please . - I didn 't guess , i ... - What ? I don 't know how to tell you how i did it . The whole time you were working on the wiring , i should 've been scared for my life . But actually i was just thinking about how nice your hair smells . - Okay . You know what ? - What ? I will not wait eight days again for you to call me . Okay . You 've got one more shot at this thing , tom . Two strikes and you 're out . Rule 27 . Hey , how about dinner ? I mean , we 're in paris and all . I 'd love to , but i have to get back to my sister . No dinner the same day you save a guy 's life . Is that rule # 26 ? That 's not a rule . That 's just me needing to see my sister . Okay . * everyone i know * is runnin ' off somewhere I 'll call you . * but still the deep blue sea * * it 's right in front of me * Becca ! Hello !

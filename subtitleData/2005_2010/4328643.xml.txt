 Look how beautiful she was . She has your mother 's eyes . Pretty soon ... I won 't know who she is at all . And when that day comes ... I want you to put a bullet in my head . I need a beer . The Guardsmen , they 're getting better . - What ? - What ... You 've got the cure ? I do indeed . I just don 't know what it was we did cure . I would really love to take a look at what 's in that vial . Can you get up here ? I 'm just as interested in this as you are , Doctor . - I can be up there tomorrow . - Great . See you then . Everyone 's getting anxious about Henshaw . I see . I will . Yes , sir . Got a second for some really bad news ? Me first . Henshaw 's dead . We all have Lethargica at 11P43 . So it 's intrinsic in the human genome ? Has Jill seen this ? I don 't know . I haven 't seen her . The question is , what woke it up ? The Guardsmen had dramatic recoveries . Within 24 hours , they were walking and talking . Then they started to get sick again . If this doesn 't work ... then Jill 's dead . David , we cannot give her the anti-retroviral , we just heard three of the Guardsmen who received it have died . Yeah , well , the 2 Guardsmen they found floating on that lake died too , and they didn 't get the shot . David , we should at least confirm it was Lethargica that killed them . We don 't even know its fatality rate . Jill just fucking flatlined in there , so I guess for her it 's 100 % . This is the only thing that 's going to help her right now . - For four days ! And then what ? - Goddamn it Carlos ! This is Jill , okay ? Four days is four fucking days ! So you got any reason for not giving it to her ? No . Reasons for giving it to her ? It buys us some time . Then I need your help . Yeah , okay . I 'll just be here two minutes , Mayko . Two minutes . Right . Call me if there 's any developments . Hey , Dad . Finally ! Where you been all week ? I was here yesterday , Dad . Hi , Josephina . Hello . Brought you your mail . Some papers there from your insurance company . So , what you two been up to today ? Oh , we just had a nice walk . Yeah , we 're talking about the Book of Revelation . Toumas don 't believe in a soul . Well if you were him ... What 's that web site called ? secondcoming.ca . - You never heard such shit . - Dad , I really should g- - Tell him what you told me . The predictions of the Bible for the end of days , they are coming true right now . Like those big hurricanes and tsunamis ? Predicted right in the Bible . Those could just be due to global warming . Yeah , that 's what I said . Tell him about the plagues . - What , of politicians ? - And what about the fire falling from the sky in Mexico City ? Well we think that 's just a inversion ... that kind of ... - And a volcano , right ? - Yeah . Oh exactly , God controls the volcanoes . You gonna answer that ? No , it 's a text message . Look Dad , I got to get going , things are really crazy back at the lab . Yeah , it 's am ... It 's amazing how many people still believe that crap . You 're in a good mood today . Well , I 've just realized one of the upsides of Alzheimer 's . - What 's that ? - You forget how stupid people can be . Bob ! Bob . How 's Jill ? She 's alive . I got your text . What 's up ? Jill 's lab book . The retrovirus that she sequenced in her stem cells ... It 's Lethargica . Same as the Guardsmen . - That 's a hell of a coincidence . - That 's no coincidence . I 'll get on it . What else did you find out ? It appears to attack our NK cells . - Natural Killer cells . - First thing it does : It knocks out the opposition 's line of defense . We 're working on finding out if that 's what allows phase two to develop . McGuinn . Connor . Okay , what about McGill and Stanford ? We asked them to concentrate on what 's reactivating the retrovirus . Mayko 's going to stay on it . Okay good . I want you to work with Bob on phase 2 . One of the infected Guardsmen who got the anti-retroviral , - didn 't get sick in phase 2 . - He didn 't get sick ? No , he 's in a hospital in Akron . They 're checking him out . Okay , that could be the key . We need to know absolutely everything about that guy . We 're going to need some blood . It could be a variation in his genes that 's responsible . Okay , I 'll get you on a flight to Akron right away . - Okay . - Let 's get to work . I 'm trying to figure out a timeline to see what started the whole infection . Now ... if Jill got infected from the Lethargica from her accident , that was 10 days before we believe she collapsed . So I backtracked 10 days from when the Guardsmen got sick . And I get the last day of war games . They 'd won and were celebrating . The party was supplied by their sergeant . - You can narrow it to one day ? - Well the next day some left and the previous 5 days they were split into two squads . So the reactivating chemicals could 've been put in something they ate . Or something they drank , or vitamin pills , or their pillowcases , - or their tooth paste . - I 'll get samples on everything . Well , if your time line works backwards , then it probably works forwards . Which means Jill 's dead in four days if we don 't figure something out . Okay , I want to do comparisons of Jill 's blood fresh samples of the Guardsmen . We have got to figure out if this phase 2 is a natural progression of the Lethargica or if it 's being caused by the anti-retrovirals . Good work , Mayko . Mayko , I know you 're really busy but ... I need a copy of everything that 's on Wes ' computer . Okay . Sure . Is anything wrong ? I don 't know . Can you break any encryptions ? - Yeah ... - Okay , good . Thanks . And ... Wes doesn 't need to know . Okay . Call me when you get there . So the only difference between phase 1 and phase 2 of this Lethargica is the level of immune response ? Way higher after the Army 's anti-retroviral was administered . Why ? Find out . Hey , Jill . These are from Bob . I couldn 't get my shit together , as usual . He says I should talk to you , so ... Let 's see ... Carlos shot you full of that anti-retroviral . Worked on the Guardsmen in about 24 hours , so you should be surfacing pretty soon . And ... Oh ... hey ... Want to watch some TV ? You 're much easier to get along with when you 're unconscious . In Jerusalem this morning , Chief Rabbis revealed the existence of an entirely red heifer . You believe this shit ? According to tradition , this rare phenomenon is the first sign of the Messiah . - The red heifer was found ... - Oh , Christ . Enough of that . Well ... I guess we can finally talk about New York . I mean , I wanted to before but then things just got all crazy and Owen showed up ... And that happened . And you basically told me to fuck off , so ... But what I wanted to talk to you about ... What I wanted to tell you , was that something ... Something occurred to me in New York . Which is that ... well when we have sex , No , I mean , not just sex , but when we even talk , you know , or fight , as the case may be , or even when I just see you at work ... It 's like ... It 's like everything I need . Yeah . It 's like I see you and ... I 'd be happy to never eat , or ... do anything , ever again . If I could just be with you . And I 've never felt that way about ... anybody ... ever . And now the thought that you might get taken away from me by ... This ... this fucking thing . So I 'm going to make you a deal , okay ? Cause I know you don 't feel the same way about me . And I know I bug you about it all the time , so ... You just wake up now , okay ? And just get better on your own and I ... And I will force myself to forget about us . And ... how it feels . And I won 't bother you about it ever again . Okay ? Just wake up now . Okay . You take your time . I 'm just going to ... wait here for a while . Just checking . I guess you 've got to be a prince for that to work . David ... Hey ! You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . We have 12,000 US troops down . - But the press is reporting 180 . - Good . They 're not onto the full extent of this yet . - You 're sure it 's Lethargica ? - Yes . Any of these troops come in contact with the Guardsmen ? No . How did this infect my chief virologist ? She has 4 days to live , Connor . I thought she caught it from the Guardsmen . Cairo Embassy is reporting that Egypt is on full alert . And we 're investigating tank movements in the Sinai . - Jesus . - She didn 't handle their samples and the timeline is wrong . She got it from that supposed accident . Caroline , I got 12,000 sick troops , in a few minutes I have to make a recommendation to the President . I need to know if NorBAC is anywhere near a cure . - No . - Within a week ? We 're doing everything we can , Connor . - What 's David 's call ? - How much anti-retroviral do you have ? - I 'm not sure . - Find out and start giving it to the soldiers . It 'll buy us some time . If these soldiers don 't get better , we 're going to have to call up more troops . They need us in the Oval Office now . I want you to hit this hard , Caroline . If we don 't stop this , all hell 's going to break loose . We 're not doing very well , Stefan . It 'll be all right , Vincent . We made it into Canada . Everything 's fine . - What if he doesn 't believe us ? - Then we have no one . - We blew it . - No . They blew it . They sent it too soon . We should never have trusted them . No , we should have had more time to make sure the cure worked . - We were ... naive . - Foolish . Stupid . - Stefan ... - Yes ? If he doesn 't believe us ... We 're going to be fine , all right ? We 'll be together . How much longer ? Three hours maybe . I 'm sorry , Stefan . Me too , Vincent . Me too . The Jews believe the Messiah will come to rebuild the Temple . The Christians believe Jesus will return after a Third Temple is built . And then there will be a huge war . Muslims believe an Antichrist figure will be a Jew who attacks the Muslims . Right , and all three events happen at the exact same location : the Temple Mount in Jerusalem . - Hey David . How 's Jill ? - She 's comin ' around . - Where 's Caroline ? - Washington . But see you need the ashes of a virgin flawless red heifer . Every single hair has to be red , in order to purify those who will rebuild the Temple . Isn 't that genetically impossible ? What is it , David ? Lethargica retrovirus on the human genome . Where is it again ? 11P43 . - Fuck . - What ? - That 's Jill 's handwriting . - I know , Bob . It 's what she copied down from the Manford brothers board in Chicago . Look ! Yeah well , those Brothers didn 't look like Al-Qaeda to me . - Maybe they were hired . - Yeah . By the US army . - To knock out their own soldiers ? - Well , then explain why the White House is refusing to let the press know how widespread this is . The big fear is that the Muslim states might seize the opportunity to invade Israel . Whatever , I will leave peace in the Middle East to you . But I 'm telling you , we need to find the Manford brothers , so they can explain to us what the fuck is going on and help us come up with a solution . Because we are no closer to finding one and Jill is running out of time . What ? Yeah . No , no , no . I 'll be right there . - Where are you going ? - Hospital . - Hey . - In a rush , Mayko . - Not now ! - We got the autopsy reports from the 2 dead Guardsmen who didn 't get the anti-retroviral . - Lethargica ? - Yeah . Did they have any inflammation of the blood vessels ? No . Okay , so that suggests that the relapse has nothing to do with the natural progression of Lethargica . - When 's Carlos back from Ohio ? - Later tonight . Okay . Thanks , Mayko . No , no , no . I 'll be right there . - Where are you going ? - Hospital . - Connor McGuinn . - Connor , it 's Caroline . Hey , Caroline . I need you to arrest the Manford brothers . What ? Who ? That investigation in Chicago ? The two brothers who sent a bottle of wine to Bush ? - Yeah , you found it was nothing . - Well , David thinks they 're the ones who found a way to wake Lethargica up . - The Manfords are behind this ? - It 's the best lead we have so far . Alright . I 'll get Homeland on it see if we can 't round them up . Five more of the Guardsmen are dead as of this morning . Shit . - Okay , well , keep me posted . - Absolutely . Okay , so ... I 've been through Wes 's computer . First thing we gotta do is find his backup drive , if he 's hiding anything , that 's where it 's going to be . But get this . The emails he deleted , I was able to recover them . There 's all this stuff about Harlan Sendak . - David 's friend ? - Yeah . Why would they want stuff on gay gene research ? Well , there 's other stuff . Testosterone . Animal genetics . Proteomics . I can 't stay here . - We just want to make sure you 're fine . - I 'm fine . We heard that before . Can we just ... Can we just get back to this , okay ? We don 't need a lab to figure out this part . Mayko said that the Guardsmen were on maneuvers , some kind of a war game and they won and celebrate with beer and pizza . And the Manfords were working with wine . Yeah . What 's in wine , beer and pizza ? - Sugar , water ... - Yeast . The brothers were using yeast in their experiments ! I was using a yeast extract for my retrovirus . What ? - Hey David , how 's Jill doing ? - She wants to get out of here . - She 's fine ! - It might be a good idea to listen to her . - What do you mean ? - Your friend Harlan Sendak . His research was sent to Washington . He died . Dr. Henshaw was on his way to help us . He died . You think somebody is tying up loose ends ? I do , David . I really do . - Okay . - What ? Get dressed . Thank you . The question is , why did the garden-variety yeast extract that NorBAC buys have the reactivator in it ? Was it an accident , or was it contaminated ? I don 't know . Hey Bob . Bob . Yeast extract that Jill used for her retrovirus work . I need you to dig it up . It 's in the corner , under the shelf with all my journals on it . Catch that ? Yeah , we think it might have the reactivator in it ... " Wow " is right . So I need you to rip it apart , okay ? Thanks . Do you really think someone wants me dead ? I don 't know . Let 's just get out of here as quietly as possible . You want to protect me ? Buy me a pit bull and get me back to the lab . - Let Caroline do some digging first . - Okay , you know what ? Just ... - What ? - Stop . Stop . Okay , just let me go first , okay ? Just in case there is somebody . Thank you . 167 phone calls in the last six months . To the same number in Washington . Come on , Wes , this is secret agent bullshit . You 've got a cell phone registered to a T. Martin . And you only call another cellphone registered to a T. Martin . Alright . Let 's talk about Harlan Sendak 's research . Where did you send the original data ? Who are you really working for , Wes ? Did T. Martin instruct you - to infect Jill with Encephalitis Lethargica ? - That 's not what he said would happen . What exactly did he say would happen ? I was asked to assist with Homeland Security . - Yeah , you already told me that . - Caroline , please . There was talk of shutting down NorBAC . They were unhappy with David . And with you , quite frankly . My loyalty is first and foremost to my country . The only reason that I 'm talking to you now is because of Jill . I was told that she would go into quarantine . Who told you ? I had no idea that she might fall into a coma . I am sorry . Who is T. Martin ? General Brian Coffey . Your contact at Homeland Security ? Who does he report to ? - He 's just a voice on that cellphone . - Just a voice , Wes ? I was approached by Agent Miller - from Homeland Security . - Why in hell should I believe you now ? Because this time ... we have everything to lose . It 's just for one night , okay ? Do you really think this will be over in a night ? Fuck . I don 't know . Okay ? Come on . What 's ... What 's going on ? Nothing . You want a beer , or something to eat ? No . I want you to talk to me . Okay . Okay ... God . What ? All of the Guardsmen except one ... They all got sick again ... Okay . It starts with a fever , and then there 's inflammation of the blood vessels and aneurysm . And ... How fast ? Four to five days after you get the shot . Wow . So ... I have tree and a half days to live ? - No . No . - Is that what you 're telling me ? No . Cause we 're going to figure it out , right ? We 're going to figure it out . But you needed to know the truth . - Shit . - Dr. Sandstrom . Dr. Sandstrom . It 's Stefan Manford . And Vincent . We need to speak to you . Don 't . - Hello . - Hello . Can we come in ? Stefan , Vincent ... You want to tell me what the fuck is going on ! ? We need your help . They 're trying to kill us . Join the fucking club ! We were testing chemicals against gene chips for all retroviruses . Hundreds a day . - And then we found ... - By pure luck . by pure luck , a steroid derivative that released Encephalitis Lethargica . We thought we should work on a cure . - It took 3 years . - And then the President lied to us . - The President ? - Yes . He wouldn 't bring back the troops . They just kept dying . We came up with a plan to make our soldiers in Iraq sick . But they would come home and we would save them . You came up with the anti-retroviral . We didn 't want to hurt anyone . They probably have thousands of doses by now . A general Coffey acted like our friend . He said , he wanted to help us end the war , too . - You ever meet this Coffey ? - No , we just spoke with him on the phone . We met an Agent Miller . Oh . Stop . You 're making my head hurt . Okay , you gave the cure to the Guardsmen . Yeah . And they got better for a while and then they got sick again . We don 't know why . It wasn 't part of our plan . Why was Jill targeted ? We don 't know . Until tonight , we didn 't know you existed . All we know is that everything we did , was sent to NorBAC - to see if you guys could figure it out . - And you didn 't . You got the wine past us , but not the Guardsmen . I 'm thinking that 's why the shit hit the fan . Come on , we 're going to the lab . - No . No , no , no , we can 't do that . - No , they 're following us . We have security . Are you sure that you can completely trust them ? No , but I have a plan . Caroline . Where are you ? Alright , well listen ... We 've got some visitors . Agent Miller , thank you for coming . Mr. Field . You sounded a little anxious on the phone . - I can 't help you anymore . - And why is that ? The bitch fired me . Alright , we 'll make a few calls ... We need you in there now , more than ever . You lied to me about Jill Langston . She could die . Wes , this is bigger than Jill Langston . Well , I just don 't know if I can keep doing this if you leave me in the dark . You don 't think you can do what ? Protect your country ? Do your duty ? What is my duty ? What am I doing here ? You 're a talented man , Mr. Field . And General Coffey appreciates your efforts . I want to know who General Coffey is . You know who he is . He 's just a mouthpiece at Homeland Security to me . In the White House . And he appreciates your help . As do we all . Wes ... You 're on the right team . Hang in there . We 're going to win this one . He 's gone . You get all that ? Loud and clear . All the way to the White House , Caroline . Yeah . I just got off the phone with the Chief Scientist . There are no sick or injured people on the inside , but a Marburg virus leak was detected . They 're following all standard safety procedures to determine the cause of the leak . In the meantime , I want this place sealed . About the perimeter , I want everybody back 100 meters - including the cops . Nobody talk to the press but me . Anybody shows up for work , tell them it 's under quarantine and they 've got to go home for the day . - Let 's suit it up , boys . - Alright . Morning , everyone . Carlos , welcome back from Ohio . Yes , these are the Manford Brothers , Vincent and Stefan ... And yes , they are the mad scientists responsible for all this fucking bullshit . And no , Bob , they 're not really mad so stop staring . Now . I have whipped up a little Marburg scare . It 'll give us a little time to work together , but not a lot . So , Stefan , Vincent , would you care to explain how the anti-retroviral was supposed to work ? It 's not specific . It triggers a major immune response . By heightening the T-cell cytokine gamma interferon , the NK , and the cytotoxic T-cells ... I was able to find the reactivating agent in Jill 's yeast extract . But how did it get there ? Did you guys put it there ? No . But you put it in the Guardsmen 's beer . Yes . What yeast company did you use ? Bracken Yeast Growers . Our uncle works there . We give him the chemical and he put it in the yeast that is used in Freedom Ring Beer . Maybe the beer yeast got cross-contaminated with the science yeast at the factory . What brand of yeast did she buy ? Bracken Yeast Growers . Private Chekovski , the kid who never got sick after taking the anti-retroviral . He 's a very average person . Average height . Average weight . Average blood and DNA . Except for one interesting thing . - What 's that ? - He is a vegan . So no meat , fish , or dairy . A lifetime of less B12 ? Less calcium ? More soy possibly ? A lot of things to look into . I don 't like where that 's going . - Why ? - Jill 's not a vegan . I got two RCMP officers with a warrant chomping on my ass . What kind of warrant ? They 're looking for a Vincent and Stefan Manford . - How the hell would I know where they are ? - What ? Listen , Chief , just tell those idiots to sit tight . We haven 't found anything yet but we can 't guarantee this ain 't the real thing . They want to suit up . Put one of them on . Yeah . Hi , listen . I know you guys think that you 've been trained to deal with this shit , but this isn 't a fucking gas leak , all right ? This is Marburg . So , you know , if you guys want to come in here , that 's fine , but you might want to know what you 're dealing with . If you rip your suit , which happens all the fucking time , within 24 hours , you 're going to come down with a headache , and then fever and chills , and that 's going to be followed by multiple organ failures , and then , you know you 'll be bleeding out of every orifice , and by then , your whole family will have it . And then you 'll die . You still there ? Yeah . So then why don 't you just sit back and let the pros handle this , and relax OK ? OK . The vegan soldier - the one who didn 't get sick again . We compared his food consumption , allergies , and did a genetic analysis . And I checked his army vaccination records - full load . Where is this going ? Obviously vaccines are made from eggs , which he doesn 't even eat . So I called him and the soldier confirmed that his records are in fact , wrong . Say again ? He never got the shots that they gave to all the other soldiers . This is an analysis of what 's in those vaccines . All vaccines against all possible germ warfare . Some of which will produce a low grade infection . This is it . Okay , this is what we got . We know we have an immune response to Lethargica . The anti-retroviral sparks more immune response . And since these guys have just had comprehensive vaccinations they 're primed to fight anything and everything . Exactly . These guys are not dying from Lethargica , there 's no phase 2 . They 're dying because the anti-retroviral thinks they 're full of these germs they 've been vaccinated against . It 's put them into a massive immune response . Jill , you didn 't take the vaccine . No . Does that mean she won 't get sick again ? Yeah . That 's exactly what that means . Well , that 's good . - Now we just have 12,000 soldiers to save . - Right . So how are we going to do that ? Well they were given the anti-retroviral yesterday . That gives them 4 days . We could treat it with massive transfusions of gama globulin and aspirin ? Might dampen the immune response . Not enough to solve it . You 'd just be a little less very sick . The Guardsmen are dying because their immune systems are too good at fighting infections . It 's too much of a good thing . That 's it ... That 's it ... What do you do if something 's too sweet ? - You add sour ? - Right . So let 's add sour . Say it again . The soldiers immune systems are in overdrive . I mean , they are desperate to fight something , right ? Specifically Lethargica . So let 's give them something to fight . Let 's grow Lethargica in a dish and inject it into the sick people . Dumb ? No , no ... smart . Right , we heat it , kill the deadly virus , we inject it , it distracts the immune response , it 'll go after the crippled virus and stop fucking around with the healthy cells . We 're going to need every lab on the continent pitching in on this , Bob . David , we 're going to have to test this . Do we have any of the Guardsmen 's blood left on ice ? Yes . I 'll get right on this . - I 'll get right on this . - Let 's all get on it . I know , David . I think they have every reason to be paranoid . Yeah , he 's here now . OK , I 'll call you later . Bye . Hey Connor . Sorry , I got caught in traffic . You all right ? Yeah , I 'm sorry I was so short on the phone . I just ... I guess I 'm getting a little spooked . Spooked ? That doesn 't sound like the Caroline Morrison I know . Yeah , well , there are a lot of things going on . A lot of things I don 't understand . Yeah . Do you know a General Brian Coffey ? Yeah , I 've heard the name . Why ? Wes Field , in my office , he 's been reporting to Coffey , without my authorization . Reporting ? Passing information , research ... More important : I don 't know who this Coffey is , I don 't know what he 's up to . What I know of Coffey , he 's a pretty shadowy guy . He works out of the White House ... Connor , I think this thing in the Middle East ... Lethargica ... I think there could be a direct link to the White House . Really ? And something else ... the Manford brothers showed up at David 's last night . Are they in custody ? Let 's walk . They wanted to stop the war in Iraq by infecting the troops . So when the troops got back , they could find a cure and be the heroes . This is a plan they came up with all on their own ? And they said that it was this General Coffey that double-crossed them ? Yeah . Connor , is there any reason why Washington would be interested in Harlan Sendak 's research ? There is some speculation that he was part of a team that engineered the red heifer that 's in the news . Engineered ? You mean it wasn 't natural ? The red heifer is a sign of the return of the Messiah . A Jewish extremist organization - a spin off of Moledet - tried to bomb the mosques in Jerusalem so the Arab nations would invade and a holy war would ensue . So they needed to find a way to knock out US troops so they could go after each other . - Shit ! - Simple as that . You get back to Toronto , Caroline . Get us a cure for those sick boys in Iraq . You have a phone call . It 's your son . - Hello ? - Hey . They ... They couldn 't find you , I thought maybe you made another break for it . No . David ? - David ? - Yeah . I 'm here , Dad . I was in the bathroom ... and there was another man there . - What ? - It was a stranger . - And he was looking right at me . - There was a man in your room ? Yeah ... And then I realized it was me . For 10 seconds ... I didn 't recognize my own face . I can 't take it , David . - I can 't . - It 'll be OK , Dad . Listen ... There is something we can try . It 's experimental , but we should really talk about it ... It might take some time , though . I love you , David . Yeah ... - David ... - Yeah . Sorry . No , no . Come on in . What ? It worked . We have a cure . Are you sure ? I 'm sure . OK . Let 's play this out . Get everyone in hazmat suits , I 'll open the gates . Right . OK , guys , as far as the RCMP is concerned , you 're still inside . So you got at least half an hour before the hazmat guys give it the all clear and the Mounties figure out you 're gone . Where are we supposed to go ? Hear the Yukon 's a pretty good place to disappear to for a while . - You 're giving us your car ? - Yeah . We can 't take that . - Sure you can . - But it 's a whole car . Look , were you guys bullshitting me when you told me you were trying to figure out a way to put an HIV vaccine in bread ? - No . - No . On behalf of the human race , consider this a down payment for all your hard work . - Thank you . - Thank you . Get out of here . Be careful . OK . Everyone , stand by . - All clear . Let the Mounties in . - It 's clean . So how many doses can we get over the next few days ? We 've already contacted 1,300 labs in the United States , Canada , the UK and Japan . With all those labs focused on the same problem we should have enough Lethargica in about 48 hours . Just in time . Outstanding work . So about the Manford brothers ... Yeah . What happened to them ? - I thought you could tell me . - Oh no . In all the confusion ... I just ... But you know , they said they tought somebody was trying to kill them . I know nothing about that . So are we still a target ? You 've done your job . We 'll make sure every Jihadi , Jewish extremist , and holy roller is aware that it 's over . Oh , and General Coffey . Turns out he 's a strong proponent of the religious right . Said Bush gave him full authority to pursue the Second Coming . - Bullshit . - Who isn 't involved in this ? It 's the Middle East . Whoever controls it , controls the future . I 'll make sure the right people hear about this , Caroline . I appreciate that , Connor . I 'm sure any funding you lost over the last year will be completely reinstated . Thank you . I thought Wes was fired . He is . It 's his last day . He 's collecting his stuff . I 'll be in town overnight , if you want to have a drink , maybe later ... I have a couple of things to do , but yeah , I 'll call you . I 'll be in town overnight , if you want to have a drink , maybe later ... I have a couple of things to do , but yeah , I 'll call you . Have you heard from the Manfords ? Yeah . I talked to them this morning . They 're OK . They 're paranoid but they 're safe . Keep in touch with them . I 'll let you know when I spin them out of this . Right . So what was McGuinn 's bullshit this time ? I know . First it 's al-Qaeda . Then it 's Jewish fundamentalists . Now it 's some Christian at the White House ? Wes ! Fucking McGuinn has spun this every way but loose . When did you tell McGuinn I fired you ? I didn 't . Where 's your phone ? The T. Martin ? What 's going on ? The Middle East is the future ... He 's right . The U.S. and China want that oil and in 20 years there 's not going to be enough for both . So if someone can get the Muslims and the Jews at each other 's throats the US could walk right in and clean up the chaos . And the oil is ours . Fuck . I don 't even know who we can trust anymore . There 's got to be somebody you can go to . I don 't know . But we 've got to be careful . I 'm so sorry , David . - What are you talking about ? - You were right about McGuinn .

 Lord Albert is dead . He was first with the symptoms . Amazing he lasted as long as he did . We must choose a new magistrate . Let us at least bury the man before we talk of his replacement . We don 't have the luxury of time . Declslons need to be made . I for one have made mine . Then your lot Is cast with Henry Bartlett . He is the only one who offers a solution . Yes , but the risk is too high . The risk of doing nothing Is worse . We 're dying ! All of us . How do we know his sorcery hasn 't brought the pestilence on us ? How could you think that ? All I 'm saying is that it 's dangerous , he 's dangerous . I 'm no danger to you , Franklin . I meant no offense , Bartlett . But this is not rain for our crops . This is life and death . You 're our magi , Bartlett . If you can rid the town of the plague , then let it be done . He speaks for the town . Not for all of us . Enough of us . We 'll be dealing with the darkest of powers . Even to invoke such an incantation - There will be consequences . Only someone with my mastery will be able to hold sway over these matters . And in order to do this , you feel you need to be magistrate ? If I am to act , Franklin , I must certainly have full authority to do so . Sir Henry , sir . You interrupt me , boy ! But , sir , it 's your daughter . Father . What is it , my child ? I have the spots now too . Come with me , my child . As I said , what higher price is there ? You must decide . I , for one , will not sit idly by while my daughter wastes away to nothing . Then you will accept the consequences ? Yes . We are not complete without you , Franklln . You must speak for the rest of the town . Yes . Then so be it . It is done . No ! No ! Every year , on this day of the winter solstice , one of us must be chosen . He will be set at the center of the town , the stockade , bound by chains and shackles . The chosen one will wear a brand , and he shall wait . This will protect you from all that is evil . The disease , this plague that I wlll pull forth from each and every dying soul won 't be cast out entirely . Everythlng evil , everything malignant , and everything wretched about what has befallen us , will rise anew , take shape , a hideous beast spawned from Hell Itself . Our fate Is now left to the mercy of that which must be fed . This manifestation of our diseases , what is this hideous beast you speak of ? The ogre . Ah ! Ah ! This looks like a good place to camp . Not yet . Well , at least we gotta let the girls catch up anyway . We 're getting close . Close to what ? Not a cell tower , that 's for sure . Would you put that away ? We 're roughing it . Roughlng It ? From the guy who walks Into a tree ? You look like you got punched out . That tree came out of nowhere . Put that away ! You 're like a child . A guy can 't rough it and still know the score of the ballgames ? Hold up , M ike . Does that looks like the entrance to a path to you ? Where 'd you get this thing , anyway ? I bought it . Not off the I nternet ? It 's authentic . No , that 's not a path . You don 't know , you don 't even care . Hey , I care , I care . It 's a great story . " A town lost in time . " A fun excuse to go camping . It 's not gonna be any fun if you don 't relax . I 'm relaxed . Jessica , does that look like a path to you ? No . Not at all . Both you guys are no fun . Terry , you know it 's unlikely we 'll actually find anything . There was a town out here . There were lots of towns out here in the 1850 's . There 's documented cases . Documented cases , Jess . Oh , hey , the book . Documents ! Look . 1947 . Hlker finds a vintage musket lying In the woods . Spotless , like brand new . 1964 , two hunters are hunting , and they see people In Clvll War era clothes . And then those people simply disappear . It 's written right there . Okay , I 'm done with the trees . Oh God , not the stupid book again . Why come if you don 't believe this ? You know what ? You guys are sucking all the fun out of this . Okay , Terry , give me the map . What ? No . Glve me the map . No . Why ? Give me the map ! North . There . Let me see that . You actually found it ! Terry - If this is the path then we need to go-Ugh ! That was a spectacular display . You alright ? Oh , oh , I can 't . It hurts . Are you really hurt ? Oh . Ooh ! Let me see . Is it broken ? I can feel the edge of the bone . Great , so what do we do now ? We are in the middle of nowhere . So If that 's broken , you can 't walk out of here , and we 're not gonna get far dragging your ass . You 're serious ? We should be smart . You guys set up camp . I 'm gonna hike on , see If I can find anything . Llke what ? A ranger 's station , a hunting lodge . I 'll go with you . No , I 'll be faster by myself . Let 's be safe , buddy system . We 'll split up . You two set up camp . We 'll be back as soon as we can . Okay ? You guys will be fine . You guys will be okay together . Don 't do anything I wouldn 't . I don 't know how to " set up camp ! " This is great . What the hell is this ? Maybe there is a town out here . Do you think It 's " Ellensford " ? Absolutely . It 's also a U F O fueling station . Big Foot , the Loch Ness Monster , they hang out here sometimes . It 's a huge party . How do you close a town ? You don 't . M ike , it says no trespassing . Yeah , but It doesn 't say " please . " You coming ? How do you go on a camping trip and not even know how to put up a tent ? It 's an expedition . They don 't put up tents on expeditions ? What do you think I bring M ike for ? This is ridiculous . I 'm freezing . I 'm sorry . Next time I 'll break my ankle next to a nice little cottage with a potbellied stove . What 's that ? M ike , what if this is a ghost town ? Like I said , we 'll camp for the night and I 'll hike back out in the morning . Well , it 's not a ghost town . M ike , wait ! Shhh ! Listen , listen ! ... one life for all life one life for all life ... U h , okay , creepy . Creepy . But it 's people . They could help . They could be creepy people . C 'mon . How about we go back . How about no . Can you help me up ? ! Fine . Oh , I slipped ! Whatever . Looks like some kind of a trap door . It 's underground . You 're going too fast ! Stop being such a baby ! You 're a baby . I wonder why I never saw this before . I don 't know , it 's freaky . Look at that ! What do you think it is ? I don 't know ! It 's creepy if you ask me . Hey , watch it ! You 're leading ! J ust keep hobbling . You have got to be kidding me . It 's the symbol , it 's burnt in . Werewolves . No , it 's not werewolves . Don 't you watch movies ? That 's the symbol for a werewolf . I n pre-Christian paganism , the five pointed star was the symbol of the sacred feminine . Read a book ! You 're such a nerd . What are you doing ? I 'm trying to open the door . What does it ... I 'm not going in there . This is the same symbol that is on the map . And ? We may have actually found something connected to Ellensford . Worst case it 's a place to get out of the cold . And I 'll stop hurting myself on branches . Ohhh , what is that smell ? I really try to like you , you 're hot , but open yourself to something other than - Terry ? Terry ? Ohh ! Well , there Is a town . If there 's a town , must be a doctor , right ? Let 's go . Let me see , let me see . Shhh ! Many years ago , a plague took hold of our town . Our young children lost the very breath of life , our women lost their husbands , our men , their loving wives . What was once a town of several hundred strong has been whittled down to those of us in this room . We are all of who remain . As we start today 's ceremony , I suggest it is more important today than ever before to remember the pain and the suffering that we all endured then , so that perhaps we might more fully understand the pain and suffering that we must certainly endure today . Another life , for another year . So It says In the sacred pact . We must ask the orb , as we have In so many years past , to give us a name . To tell us who is the brave heart that we wlll offer up . One life , for all life . One life , for all life . Okay , let 's go . Yeah ! Ahh ! We have decided , and the chosen one Is Stephen Chandlerl We must stop this ! This is wrong . All of you ! We must fight the beast ! End the pact ! Search your hearts , you know I am right ! No , Father , no ! Let us all offer a blessing to Stephen Chandler . May he have strength , honor and peace . No , Father , no ! Please Father , no ! Please don 't ! Sorry , it 's out of my hands ! Okay , guys , this is a big misunderstanding . What the hell is your problem ? He is coming . Who 's coming ? Good day , young travelers . Good day for who ? Are we under arrest ? That remains to be seen , you 're trespassing . I don 't know if you 're the mayor or something but we need your help . It was unwise of you to ignore our sign . We didn 't see a sign . What sign ? There Is one road In and out of Ellensford . Otherwise it 's surrounded by forest . You saw our sign . Did you just say this is Ellensford ? Okay , we 're sorry , you know what , we saw your sign . My friend 's hurt . He possibly has a broken ankle . He needs help - You know what help is ? You should 've gone somewhere else . We do not welcome outsiders In Ellensford . We have no way of knowing what you have seen or heard . Look , we get it . You 've been hospitable but we 're gonna take off . I do not think so , young man . Now It 's Impossible for you to leave . I 'd like you to take our guests to the waiting place . Send men out to get their friends in the woods , and bring them to me at once . Okay , guys . Run ! Ahh ! Ahh ! Serlously get your hands off mel Let go of me ! Any Idea how many penal codes you broke in the last five minutes ? Don 't push me ! My father 's a prominent attorney . Okay , you 're not even allowed to do that . You 're not even a copi You guys are in so much trouble ! We get a phone call , or don 't you guys have phones ! ? It 's in Sir Henry 's hands now . He makes the rules . I bid you good luck . And I bid you an idiot ! M ike , how can they leave us here ? I didn 't do anything wrong ! Jess , relax , okay . I 'll get us out of here . Not likely . What 'd they get you for , jaywalking ? Jaywalking ? No . I am the Chosen One . That 's pretty . Chosen for what ? It doesn 't matter . You should not have come here . Really ? Because we didn 't get that sense at all yet . It 's all in Sir Henry 's hands now . The guy with the stick ? You 've got to be kidding me . This is no joke . You people cannot be serious . Please , don 't be serious . Is this an actor 's hamlet ? This whole thing is a play ? You pretend to be from this mythical town ? Yeah ? I don 't understand . This is no play . No myth . It is our plight . Ah . What 's the Chosen One ? Chosen for what ? Sacrifice . Ah , okay . I don 't believe this . Sacrlflce ? They 're gonna kill us ? Offer us to the gods , that kind of thing ? Not you . Me . One life for the prosperity of the many . You got a bum rap . These are very serious matters . A powerful spell governs our land . Oh , come on ? Come on to what ? She doesn 't believe any of this . Nelther do I. Whether you choose to believe it or not , tomorrow , I will be offered as the sacrificial meal . They 're gonna eat you ? ! Not them . Okay , who is gonna eat you ? The ogre . Hope , over the years we 've all lost those we love . I ncluding you and your father . Yes , my mother was one of the first . I remember it as if it was yesterday . But at least she died of the plague . At least she died of natural causes . I don 't know how natural the plague was to begin with . Never mind that . I 've misspoken . No , I 've heard the rumors , Franklln . I am not deaf . We were all there that day . Your father did what he had to do . We all agreed . You didn 't . They forced your hand , I remember it . That was years ago . What 's done , is done . Why are you here now ? You know I can 't save Stephen . Some people in the town talk of ending it . Stephen was the most outspoken of them all . But I understand that you share his feelings . I do as well . Not to offer sacrifice would mean the death of us all . We 're already dead ! We 're the living dead who each year live In fear of being chosen . Who can 't leave this cursed town , who don 't age , don 't marry , don 't have young . Who calls this a life ? Please . I understand your concerns , but there was a pact . It Is not easy to change that . The people will follow you . They trust you . Look at me . J ust by being here I am opposing my own father . You must speak to him . If not for us , then for the travelers . I fear my father has ill intentions . Please , Franklin . You must talk to him . If they 've crossed the boundary , there 's no following them . What in God 's name - The doors are open . It 'll come for us all . We must head back and warn the others . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Slr Henry ? How can I help you , Franklin ? I 've come to talk about these travelers . What about them ? May I ask , what are your Intentions ? My intentions ? Why are you holding them ? Well , because they have seen too much . What are you going to do with them ? Sacrlflce them ? If such a possibility exists . The outsiders have not made this bargain . It 's wrong to punish them with a curse we brought on ourselves . It 's murder . How dare you ? So It Is your Intention . My Intention Is , as always , to do all that is necessary to protect this town . Should I do this thing , then Stephen Chandler , will have the opportunity to live another two years , perhaps even four if we find the others . How can you argue with that ? Are you telling me the ceremony is rigged ? That the chosen one can be changed at will ? Your will ? The audacity you have to question me on these matters . I am this town 's magistrate - Don 't throw that title at me ! I was there . But it was given to me ! It was taken ! Get out . A magi wanted to be magistrate . Then suddenly a mysterious plague befalls our town , forcing our hand to anoint the only one who has the power to stop it . That is enough ! Be careful , Franklin ! Or what ? You 'll choose me next ? You walk a very dangerous line , my friend . There is a growing number of us who feel this should end . We should stand up to the ogre once and for all . Kill the ogre and stop making the sacrifice ? It 's the ridiculous dream of a child . Every year one of us Is eaten . That Is a nightmare . That Is why I was made magistrate . I knew none of you would have the will to do what is necessary . And what 's that ? We sacrifice for your eternal life ? We are all In thls together . Lest you forget , we don 't grow in number . I too will die . Who will be the one to chain you to the stockade ? # Swlng low # # Sweet , sweet ogre # # Coming for To carry me home # M ike ! Shut up ! # What , Jessica ? # Don 't you think maybe we should do something ? I 'm open to suggestions , sister . Terry and Leah are still out there . They 're in a better position than we are . I 'm serious . M ike , what about the you know ... Le ogre ? You serious ? You believe this guy ? He 's a nut casei Everybody in this town is out of their freaking mind . You shouldn 't have come here . How could I not ? I am regretful for the actions of this town . I ndeed , as we are . Please doth grant us swift exit from here and we promlseth never to returneth-agaln-eth . He seems to be a jester of sorts . I find him quite amusing considering the dire circumstances . It 's Sir Henry 's intention to let young Stephen go and offer up you as the sacrifice Instead . Hope , we can 't let that happen . I 'd listen to young Stephen on this one . I have learned things today . An awful truth , my father ... What is it ? Know that even Franklin is growing more brave by the minute . Has he spoken to your father ? Yes . There is no convincing him . Hang on , Is your father Henry Bartlett ? Stick dude ? My condolences . What the hell was that ? I must go . Father ! Looking for something ? No . Well , yes . A book . Something I could help you with ? A book of stories , from when I was small . You 're no longer a child , my dear . What possible curiosity could such a book hold for you now ? It used to comfort me at night when I was scared . I want to give it to young Stephen to comfort him as he awaits his end . And what if young Stephen were not to be chosen this year ? Or next , isn 't that what you mean ? There are two travelers in the cell with Stephen . I thought this would make you happy . So you did this for me ? To make me happy ? Father , I am not happy ! None of us are ! We don 't know what happiness is anymore ! Use your powers and put an end to this . That 'd make me happy . I cannot do that . Have you even tried ? Hope , even if I could reverse such dark magic , I wouldn 't do it . Not if it meant I had to sit by and watch my daughter waste away to nothing . I won 't do that . But these travelers were not part of that pact . So you would prefer this happen to young Stephen ? I 'd rather it be no one ! It is not possible ! If the ogre does not accept the intended sacrifice , he will exact his revenge over the entire town , a wrath only Imaglnable In the very depths of hell Itselfl I cannot and will not preside over such an event ! How is one death different from any other ? The men never returned . I fear the worst . What If the lair has been disturbed ? We must send another search party . No , it 's too late for that . Their fates have already been sealed . But , if the beast has eaten - perhaps we need not sacrifice tonight . It 's the very act of sacrifice , of being chosen and submitting to the beast Itself that fulfills our end of the bargain . These travelers have not been chosen . But still , if the lair has been disturbed , we 'll have to make a sacrifice right away to keep it from coming after us all . Do you see ? Do you see now ? These travelers have brought undue pain onto us all . Because of them , two more of us are dead . It would appear that the decision has been made for us . The plague , it is true . I hope Terry and Leah are smart enough to realize that we need help . Maybe they can get us out of this . You know , I bet Terry is hopping to it right now . M ike , I 'm serious . I 'm just getting a little bit scared here . It 's not funny . No , it 's not funny ! It 's ridiculous . Stevie , this whole town of yours , you are all freakin ' nuts . You should do what normal kids do and run away . We can 't . Why not ? I 'd be so far gone right now . That 's you . But we cannot leave this town . And therein lies the rub . Okay , Stevie , what happens if you leave this town ? Awful things . N ight has fallen . They will come for me soon . Now I thought they were coming for me . Ohhh ! Mlke , what Is It ? I Shutter your wlndowsl Lock your doorsl Shutter your wlndowsl Lock your doorsl Shutter your windows ! Lock your doors ! Shutter your wlndowsl Lock your doorsl Young Stephen . The eyes of good fortune look upon you this evening . It is my time ! I am indeed the Chosen One . Bring forth the boy . Don 't touch her . Get your hands off her-oh ! Do not do this ! It is my turn ! I am chosen ! Please , you don 't understand I No , please , he didn 't do anything ! I didn 't do anything ! My friends are still out there ! They 're calling the cops as we speakl Your friends are dead . Dead at the hands of the beast . You don 't know that ! You are all at the mercy of the ogre now and he shows no mercy . Bring the boy ! M ike ! Jess , he 's lying ! Jess ! M ike ! Mlkel Get back here ! Move ! Let go of me ! Let go ! Mlkel I Stop It I That 's enough I Cut It out I Thls Isn 't funny I Stop It I I am warning you ! Stop this ! Mlkel I Jess ? It 's okay ! Alright , it 's cool . You people are crazy . All of you ! If anything happens to him - Hope ? Stay inside now . Let me gol Take this off now I I 'm warning you ! This has gone way too far ! Dude , let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! That 's enough ! Get back here ! Grrr ! Hope ? Hope ! You risk everything . Everything that is worth risking . Oh , God , shut up . Where 's M ike ? Let 's go get him then , shall we ? Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm great , I 'm great . We must hurry ! We must go . This way . Hope Bartlett ! Wait . From here , you must go on alone . You 're coming with us . If you go back , they 're gonna feed you both to the thing . Maybe so , but we cannot leave this place . We cannot cross the boundary . If you weren 't planning on coming with us , then why ? Because it 's time . You two aren 't part of this . We 're a good people . We 've just lost our way . Run I Run for your llvesl He can 't cross It I Stephen ! Hope ? ! Stephen , no ! No ! Gol Get away from this placei Gol The bell hasn 't rung . All is not well . Sir Henry ! Sir Henry , are you there ? He 's gone ? I don 't understand . There was no sacrifice ? How could that be ? Could he have escaped ? Not without help . Franklin , maybe this was your doing . How could you suggest that ? We must assemble the town immediately . The prison cell is empty . Treason ! We must set out and find them ! No ! We must assemble . Now . Where 's Sir Henry ? We can right this wrong . All of you , fair to the town hall . I n Sir Henry 's absence , it is my word . It is my word . Hope ? Hope ! Okay , I 'm sorry , I know , But did you see that ? The way he just-pft ! I know , Jess . Look , this is gonna turn out okay . We 're gonna make it through , believe that . Oh , yeah , okay , and what if what that guy said was true and Terry and Leah really are dead ? I don 't know , Jess . We have to believe otherwise . Oh my God ! Yes ! Yes ! You see ! I 'm so happy ! Okay . We 're okay . What the hell are we gonna tell people ? What ? The truth . What truth ? The truth about an ogre ? A town lost In time , that doesn 't age ? The Imaginary line that disintegrates people In seconds ? Which one do you want to lead with ? We 'll just have to take them back there . Never thought I 'd say this , but we need to find the cops . We explain everything and then we take them there , and then we 'll prove it ! U h-huh . Look , there 's our ride . This is not gonna go well . Hellol Where is Sir Henry ? And why was there no sacrifice ? What do we do now ? The ogre will seek revenge on us all ! Everyone , please ! We must remain calm . We must use our wits , and not be driven by fear or anger ! Where is Sir Henry , Franklin ? What kind of trickery is this ? I don 't know where the others are . What I do know is the pact has been broken . The ogre 's wrath may be set upon us . There is still time ! Henry Bartlett could not just have disappeared , he wouldn 't do that I I already went to his home . He was nowhere to be found . Perhaps then Sir Henry has gone to capture the outsiders himself ! Perhaps , but we must move on without Sir Henry for now . Where 's Hope ? And Stephen ? I don 't know ! Do you know anything ? ! Quiet , please ! Hope Bartlett I Hopel What are you doing out here , child ? I was worried sick . You used to teach me the craft once , remember ? We have no time for that , Hope . I must offer up another sacrifice before it is too late . If we must sacrifice , then choose me . No . You 'd never do that . Who shall it be this time ? You don 't understand . Not Stephen . He 's already dead . The outsiders are gone . Who 's next ? Franklin ? Is he your biggest threat ? You watch your tongue , young lady . Maybe you can waive your staff and cause another plague , one worst then the last . We can 't wait ! We must sacrifice now . It is our only chance ! And who is to choose ? You , Giles ? Or are you volunteering yourself for sacrifice ? If the travelers made it past the border , then we should find Stephen Chandler , as first planned . And what If he Is never found ? Enough I Thls Is pointless , people . Thls Is a sign . The travelers were not a harbinger of doom . We need to look upon them as a beacon . An example that exposed the ills of this town , that have gone on for far too long . Henry Bartlett lied about the Chosen One . No ! How much further did his lies go ? ! We must find him , then . Accusations like this should not be slung in his absence . He Is not here now . Wlthout him , It Is my say . I have found the book . I have seen the spells ! You are a monster ! Hope , it wasn 't supposed to be this way . It was only supposed to be one ... Lord Albert . The town needed a new leader . I knew what the town needed , the town needed me . The spell couldn 't be controlled and it spread . I did all I could . You did what you wanted . I gave you eternal life ! All you gave us was death . Your gift , " Thls will protect you from all that Is evil . " Those were your words , remember ? Hope - Father-you are evil . Evil or not , this town needs me now , more then ever . What could you possibly do ? ! What we should have done years ago . Find a way to destroy the beast without your help . It can 't be done ! Don 't you understand ! That Is the true plague of Ellensford I I Kill the beast or not , it doesn 't matter , you will all perish ! I will rejoice the day . We all will . Hope . Hope ! We need to take arms against the beast . Flght It once and for all . That 's like signing our own death warrant ! Something is moving in the trees ! Hopel Hope , you have given us all a horrible scarel Where is your father ? I do not know . We all must listen to Franklin now . There will be no more sacrifices . If the ogre is to set his wrath upon us , we must be ready . We can 't defeat the ogre . I cannot stop the ogre , not yet . But I can buy us some time . Hope , what are you talking about ? What is all this ? Years ago , my father passed on some of his craft to me . As a precaution should this day ever come . Do you want to live through this night ? Then listen to me . Everyone grab one candle . Take only as many as you need to last the night . Franklln and I wlll come to your homes and teach you the magic of the candles and how to use them against the ogre . Henry Bartlett Is alive , Lawrence . H is daughter and Franklin are up to no good , and it is up to us now to restore the order . What do you suggest we do ? We 've got to find Sir Henry . But the ogre ? Going into the woods now is suicide . And to follow the plan of some impetuous young girl . I say we find our leader . Done . Ahhhhhhh ! U nclean beast . Really , thank you very much . Are we really gonna do this ? I don 't know . Are you sure you got that punch line right ? Help you ? Yeah , we were hiking in the woods ! Our friends got hurt I - happened to our friends . Whoa ! Let 's take this one at a time . Why don 't you both sit down and slow down . Our friends are lost . This isn 't gonna be easy to explain - Two of our friends - We were hiking - Hang on , you 're gonna give me whiplash . You . Go . We were on a hiking trip with two of our friends , Terry and Leah . Terry hurt , and he probably ended up breaking his ankle . So we left him to get some help - Left him , huh ? No , we didn 't " leave " like abandon . They were okay when we left them . " Were " okay ? Are okay . " Were " or " are " ? Are ! You 're not from around here , are ya ? No , we 're from ... Listen bro , this is important - Sheriff ! I 'm sorry . Sheriff . Know that town out In the woods ? Llke an Amlsh village ? Ellensford . You hear that , Anderson ? They 're looking for " Ellensford . " We 're not looking for Ellensford , we were there . Son , I 've lived here all my life . There 's no town out there . That 's an urban myth . We 're not crazy I We were therel They kidnapped us and locked us in a jail cell ! Kidnapped , huh ? Do you know what an ogre is ? Ogre ? What the hell are you talking about ? An ogre , okay ? A beast , lives in the woods , eats people ? Sure I know what an ogre is . Anderson , you know what an ogre is , don 't you ? Yeah , sure do . Name 's Patty . Been married 12 years . We 're raising a little ogre too . I am not joking around , this is serious ! Are you guys gonna help us ? We need help ! Sure we 'll help ya . I 'm gonna go get the paperwork , we 'll take your statement , then we 'll see about finding your friends . Okay , please hurry . It 'll just be a moment . You two go sit over there . M ike , no , no way . They don 't believe a word of it . Would you ? No . No turning back now . Anderson ... I got to go , bye ! Where 'd they go ? Sherlff , I just turned away - Son of a - Slr Henry ? Slr Henry I You hear something ? No . Sir Henry ? Sir Henry ! Keep your voice down ! Why don 't you set a table for the ogre before you send him to dinner ? Giles , this is foolish . We should go back . And do what ? We must find Sir Henry . What if something else has already found Sir Henry ? Wait . Giles ! We 're stuck . Yeah , no kidding . I told you this thing couldn 't go off road . It 's not a freakin 'S U V. Stop , stopl Let me get out and check it . Okay , go . M ike ! Stop ! Mlkel Feel better now ? Well , they 're gonna come looking for it . We wanted them out here anyways . Yeah , but without the grand theft auto charges would have been nice . It 's cute . There we go . Whoa , okay , do you know how to work that thing ? No . Okay , that 's scary . More shells . You know , If we go back In there , we may not come out . Yeah , I know , but , we have to try . I told Leah and Terry I was coming back for them . J ust making sure we 're working with all our faculties . After everything I 've seen in these woods so far , I 'm winging it . At best . Okay . Pour a circle of salt around your house . The circle will act as protection against the ogre . Thls Is our barrier , keeps us from leaving this town . Once your candle Is lit , you must keep the candle burning . Now repeat these words with us . Wlthln this circle , all things material and human , shall be safe and untouched from the evil within the forest until the flame burns no more . Wlthln this circle , all things material and human , shall be safe and untouched from the evil within the forest until the flame burns no more . Don 't worry , Mother . We will be safe now until Father returns . Your father would be proud . Don 't worry , he 'll return . I 'm sure he 's all right . My father is dead . Dead ? It will be okay , Franklin . One way or another this shall all come to an end . It Is time for all of us to face our destiny . Heaven help us . Maybe Father has already slain the ogre , on his way home with the good news . Yes , I should pray so . Here we are . Oh , my God . Jess ! What ? It 's Terry . Oh my God . M ike ? Where are you going ? I 'm going back to that town ! You can 't . It killed Leah and Terry . And that thing killed them ! That guy Stephen saved your life . And Hope saved mine . So I 'm going back there . If there 's a way to kill this thing , I 'm gonna find it . No ! M ike ! Oh . A nail of the beast . Shh , child . The spell will work . See ? Better now . It 's alright . I have it now . We 've been walking for hours . What if we can 't find that place again . The sheriff didn 't even know it existed . That sheriff doesn 't know his own stench exists , never mind this place . We 're close , okay ? Okay , but what if we 're walking in circles this whole time ? M ike - Jess ! Enough ! I 'm sorry . We 're close . How are we even going back again ? Shh . Go . M ike ! I think we 're back . Everyone , quiet . Please . Glve the travelers a chance to speak . Alright , we encountered your ogre and we lived . Shots from my gun chased It clean through the woods . If It ran , It means It was hurt . If it was hurt , it can be killed . Bullets won 't kill the ogre . We need more than your gun to destroy It . We need more candles , more powder from hope . It Is the only reason that the beast did not take more of us last night . No . William is right . We need more than a gun . There is a chance I can undo my father 's spell but it 's gonna take time . If there was a way to kill the ogre , why haven 't we tried it before ? Where was our will before ? My father had us living In fear . Now we have to be brave . This is our only chance . The ogre will need to be distracted . Distract the ogre ? How do you plan on doing that ? With bait . And just what ? Or dare I say who is going to be that bait ? Me . The traveler Is right . They 're the only ones that can cross the line and come back . That Is our advantage . Alrlght . We need as many men as we have weapons . Where 's Glles ? Where 's the keeper of arms ? Matthew , where 's your father ? Where is Giles , my boy ? ! This is not a time for secrets ! He and Lawrence took arms from the supply and went into the woods to find Sir Henry . He 's not returned ? You must be strong . Like your father . How many more sons , daughters , loved ones must be sacrificed ? How many lives have we all lived confined by this curse ? The time has come to face our fear . Defeat the ogre , no matter the consequence . I need men . Good . The rest of you wlll take refuge here In the town hall . You 'll only be safe by combining what candles we have left . Matthew , will there be any remaining arms In the keep ? There was not many to begin with . Then we will make with our hands what else we need . Not what you 'd call an arsenal . We 'll have to do . Do they work ? Giles polished them everyday . He kept them In prime condition . Rock and roll . These are too small . How about this one ? That 's the one . Yes . I 'm back ! Come get me ! Come and eat me , you beast ! No turning back . Hold . Get him ! Now ! Hope ! Now ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! Hope ! Ahhhh ! Hope needs more time ! We don 't have more time ! Jess , run for the line , now ! Meet us at the line ! Come on , Jess , keep going ! Come on , run ! Come get us now . H it him . Hope ! Let 's go ! Hope ! Hope ! The spell ... it 's broken . Then ... it is over . Hope ? It 's time to go . What the hell are you talking about ? What 's going on ? It 's okay . Don 't worry . What just happened to them ? The spell is broken . We 're free . We killed that thing . It 's done . It 's okay . Our time came long ago . Thls Is the only way . Thank you . Without you , we may never have found the strength . Hope , this -

 Boy , they have no idea ! We just moved . These kids go missing and the police don 't have a clue . Welcome to Spellman 's magical museum of the circus . They 're alive . Run ! He 's sealed the doors . You are mine to feed on . Fear me ! You are mine ! Don 't let him touch you ! Oh , sweet , sweet fear ! Give me a hand ! Why are you coming after me ? You have a ticket . You are mine . Get away from her ! I 'm not scared ! But you are scared of me , Sarah Jane Smith . Of all the things you have seen , of all the things out of the dark you have fought , it 's me that lives in your nightmares . The painted face of a clown . Mum ! MOBILE PHONE RINGS Quick we 're out , come on ! Run ! He 's frozen ! The electromagnetic wave must have interfered with Spellman 's energies . It won 't last . What 's going on ? ! There is a time and a place for an interview . And being chased by a clown from outer space is not it ! Rani ! Just get in the car . MOBILE PHONE RINGS OK , annoying ring tones have their uses . But they 're still annoying ! It 's my mum , what do I tell her ? That you 're on the way home . You expect me to go home ? You have to tell her . No . I told you . Both of you . That phone is doing my head in ! I 'm going to offer you a choice , Rani . Cross over the road , go back to your parents and your old life . And nothing will have changed . Or you can come with me . If you do , nothing will ever be the same again . I want to know the truth . Then tell your mum I 'm giving you work experience . This way . This place is huge . You ain 't seen nothin ' yet . And this is where it gets interesting . How cool is this ? This is where you work ? That 's right . What 's this ? That 's a distress beacon from a scout ship . Careful ! You 'll have an inter-galactic rescue team landing on the corner . I thought you were a journalist ? I am . Not with alien gizmos , who doesn 't bat an eyelid at a shape-changing alien clown-pied-piper thing ? That 's more of a hobby . Any second now , my alarm will go off and it 's my second day at Park Vale - a new school with your dad as Head Teacher . Anyone would have nutty dreams . All right , this is what we do . When aliens come to Earth , and they do , all the time , if they 're friendly and they need help , we give it . If they want trouble , we give ' em that , too . I wouldn 't put it like that . But we have saved the world 12 times now . No-one is keeping score . Except Luke . What 's important are the rules . We respect all life , whatever planet it 's from , and we tell no-one what we do . Do you understand ? No-one . Yes , I understand . Mr Smith , I need you ! What 's happening ? It 's only Mr Smith . Yes , how can I help you ? It 's a computer ! A talking computer ! You 've got a talking computer . He 's a Xylok . A crystalline life form - the smartest in the Galaxy . But computer 's close enough . Tell me everything you know about the Pied Piper and a clown called Odd Bob . This has to do with the missing children . Across America in the period 1932 to 1940 there were disappearances of children connected to a travelling clown known as Odd Bob . What about the Pied Piper ? I don 't think we 've been introduced . This is Rani . She 's just visiting . What about the Pied Piper ? A figure who in 1284 rid the town of Hamelin of rats by a magical tune . When the town refused to pay him he enchanted away all its children . Could it be true ? It 's a matter of fact that Hamelin lost its children . You mean it 's true ? I want you to scan this , Mr Smith . I 'm detecting an alien energy . What sort of energy ? I can find no comparable data for analysis . This is something from way off ? Show me the extra-terrestrial records for Lower Saxony in the Thirteenth Century . What 's that ? In the mountains ? A meteorite fragment which landed in 1283 . The year before the Piper arrived . The Piper was in the meteor ! Result ! The meteorite had a diameter of 30.12 centimetres . An unlikely spacecraft . What do we know about it ? The meteorite is on loan for research from the University of Munich to the UK . You mean it 's here ? If I were able to analyse a fragment , I could provide some information . Of course . Where is it ? The Pharos Institute . Are you going to get this meteorite ? It might be the key to stopping Spellman . I have a contact at the Pharos Institute . I think they 'll help me . I 'd like to help you . The last thing I wanted was for you to get involved in all of this , in what I do . Up there , among the stars , there are fantastic civilizations . Life forms . But some are dangerous . That mean us harm . I stop them . I 've done it for so long . But if I could turn back time , Luke and Clyde wouldn 't be involved . I don 't know if I 'll always be able to protect them . You don 't need another kid to worry about . Yes . But I 'm involved . Odd Bob is after me and every kid that has these tickets . This is a Vorgatt defence field emitter . Turn it on , place it in the middle of your room . It 's a force field that will prevent anything harming you . Make sure that you are never alone . Is that it ? I promise you , I will stop Spellman . You can 't expect me to live across the road and forget about this . I expect you to keep it a secret . To never tell anyone . Not even Mum and Dad ? Do you think they 'd believe you ? No . Goodnight , Rani . It 's incredible , isn 't it ? The universe . Aliens and everything . I mean , it 's scary . But it 's all real . That 's amazing . Yes , Rani . Yes , it is . Why do they scare you ? Oh . Luke . Odd Bob , he scared you . I 've never seen that before . When my Aunt Lavinia brought me up , my room was full of toys that used to be hers . One of them was a marionette . A puppet clown . I never liked it . It always seemed to be watching me . One night , there was a tremendous thunder storm . I screamed the house down . What happened ? Aunty told me not to be silly . It was a puppet . It was a trick of the light in the storm , perhaps it was . But it was the first time I ever cried out for my parents . You see , I never really knew them . I was a baby when they died . Rise and shine ! Morning ! Mum ! Mum , are you all right ? Oh , I don 't know . Is it one of your migraines coming on ? I suppose . It aches like I walked into a brick wall . It feels like I did ! Maybe you 've been over-doing it . Yeah . Yeah , I suppose . There 's your tea . Hurry up , your breakfast is on . Miss Smith . So good to see you again . Professor Rivers . Do come this way . We owe you a great debt of gratitude over that business with Nathan Goss . If anything had appeared in the media , it would have ended the institute . There are some things it 's best the public don 't know . Oh , thank you . But your interest in the Weserbergland meteorite , it 's not dangerous , is it ? I hope it can help end something that is . Ah , thank you . We think it came from deep , deep space . But the samples we 've seen from Mars offer far more evidence of extra-terrestrial life . You won 't take much ? This is highly irregular . Normally , I wouldn 't allow it but ... You won 't notice . Well , I think it 's best if I wasn 't here . If you wish . What are you doing Miss Smith ? I didn 't mean to frighten you . I 'll find out what you are . We 're only scared of what we don 't understand . When I know what you are I will stop you . Suppose there isn 't anything to be understood ? Suppose I am beyond understanding ? Suppose as the thunder crashed and the lightning flashed ... .. your aunt 's clown really did come to life ? How could you know about that ? It was a trick of the light . Then why are you still so scared ? You need people to be frightened of you . That 's why you take the children . That scares us most , the thing it 's almost impossible to understand . And today , just for you , Miss Smith , I will chill the blood of a nation . A thousand families will ache with loss and millions will shudder , sleepless with a bone-gnawing fear . What are you going to do ? Are you finished Miss Smith ? I can 't believe we 're at school with that alien still out there . Welcome to our world . We 're alien hunters , Defenders of Earth , but everything stops for school . So was Maria one of you , then ? Yes . That 's what you meant when you said we couldn 't be friends in the same way ? He 's here . It 's Odd Bob . He 's here . What 's going on ? The balloons are controlling of them . OK , this does not feel good . Where are the kids ? He 's leading them away like the Pied Piper . The meteorite 's from the Jeggora-bax cluster . I 've never heard of it . It 's a dark nebula . What about energy traces ? There is a residue matching the sample I analysed . Entities in this region are created by emotions like fear . This energy came here in a meteor that fell in Hamelin where the people were terrified by a plague of rats . Once manifested the entity required more fear for survival . It took the children . To create fear . And it 's been doing the same thing ever since . You 'd better get down here . Turn around ! You don 't know what you 're doing ! You 're in danger ! Don 't you understand ? ! Come back , where are you going ? They 're heading for the circus museum . This must be what he was talking about , he 's going to make the school vanish . Don 't follow them . I 'll be there as soon as I can . Mr Smith , I have a job for you . They won 't turn back . It 's like they 're zombies . I think Spellman is controlling them . But what 's he going to do with them ? They 'll vanish . He 's not interested in the children , it 's the fear their disappearance causes . Spellman feeds on fear . Roll up ! Roll up ! Welcome to Spellman 's Magical Museum of the Circus . Just step this way ! I don 't think so . I don 't think you have any say in the matter . Perhaps I should phone a friend ? Connecting now . Oh . It looks like his line 's busy . It must be Mr Smith . He 's scanned the school records and rung every pupil . The phone signals are interfering with Spellman 's power . You meddle with me at your cost , Sarah Jane Smith ! I 'm not scared of you ! Or Odd Bob ! You think you have conquered your fear ? I will show you fear ! Sounds like a bad loser to me . Everyone 's going back to school . Luke ? Luke ? ! He was right next to me . Where 's he gone ? No ! I 'm not having this ! No , Clyde . You stay here . You , too , Rani . Luke is my son . I 'm going after him on my own . No way . We 're coming to help you ! I 'm not going to risk losing both of you . Stay here ! She 's locked us out ! What will we do ? We 've got to find another way in ! Spellman , where are you ? I 've come for my son ! Help , help ! Luke ! Help ! Luke ! Spellman ! Where are you ? ! Not scared of me , Miss Smith ? I think you are ! If you 've hurt my son , I will destroy you ! The fear of a mother for her young , the strongest fear of all . You better believe it ! Give us a hand . Maybe you should stay here . It 'll be dangerous in there . Would Maria have stayed out here ? No . Yes . Come on , Spellman , no more smoke and mirrors . If you 're looking at getting fat on my fear , you 're looking at a lo-cal lunch . Tastes like fear to me . What have you done with Luke ? He 's with the others . The others ? The boy in the stationery cupboard , the boy playing football . If you want me to count them all , I would pull up a chair . It has been over 700 years , don 't you know ? Where are they ? Somewhere between this world and another . They are sleeping . I don 't want to harm them . I don 't need to . All of them ? They 're fine ? Well , after a while , they just fade away . Bring them back now ! Oh , I can 't do that . Can you imagine ? A bogeyman that brings children back from Never Never Land ? Who would be scared of me then ? Boo . I would cease to be . If you don 't exist , the harm you 've done is reversed . The children you have taken will be returned . Luke . But you cannot destroy me . No-one can destroy fear . It is part of you all . I am part of you all . How do you fight fear ? What can we do ? I 'll tell you . Now , if you are so concerned for your son , let me take you to join him . I 'm sure your disappearance , in time , will give me much nourishment . Mr Spellman , listen to this . Two aerials got married . You should 've seen the reception ! Another child , another frightened mother . You have a ticket , Clyde Langer . Keep away from him ! What do you call a sheep with no legs ? A cloud ! Police toilet stolen . The cops have nothing to go on ! A magician was driving down the road and he turns into his house . What is this ? Come on folks , how about a bit of audience participation ? What 's invisible and smells like carrots ? Rabbit farts . I thank you , thank you . Where would you find a one-legged dog ? Where you left him . She 's nicking my material . Stop this ! Stop it now ! Does the sound of laughter upset you ? Does it frighten you ? You will fear me ! He 's getting weaker ! Two fish in a tank , one says , " Can you drive ? " An Optician tells a guy he 's colour blind . " That 's a bolt out of the green ! " How did Count Dracula escape from Transylvania ? He used a blood vessel ! What 's wrong ? Not game for a laugh ? People have shuddered with fear in my shadow for over 700 years . And now they 're rocking with laughter . Sarah Jane ! I went to the dentist he said , " Say Aah ! " I said , why . He said , " My dog 's dead . " Of course that 's it ! You can 't destroy me with pathetic jokes ? These are classics . I 'm just going to put you back where you belong , where you don 't need anyone 's fear to survive . No ! This is where you belong . The meteor that brought you to Earth . You were strong enough to resist its pull . But not any more . The nightmare is over ! Thank you ! The joker in the pack . Every alien-busting team should have one . Good thinking . Well , it was Rani 's idea . But I told him to be funny . Mum ! Oh , Luke ! Luke , Luke you 're all right ! What happened ? Where 's Spellman ? I imagine you could say he 's finally paid the piper . The children taken in recent weeks have all been found . They have no memory of what happened , but were released when the energy entity was returned to the meteor fragment . And that is going in here . Halkonite steel . Nothing can get through it . Not even thoughts . What happens now ? Do you trust me to keep all this secret ? When it comes to getting a glimpse of the universe , there are two types of people . Those who refuse to believe , and those that embrace the universe , and just how special life is , and want it to stay that way by keeping it safe , and secret . And that 's me ? That 's all of us . Where have you been ? I didn 't think you 'd get involved in this walk out . A walk out ? The whole school went walk about then comes back claiming not to have known what they 'd been doing . A good way of winding up the new Head Teacher . Cos I 'm the joker in the pack , aren 't I ? We had free periods . We 've been at the library in town researching for a project . That 's why she didn 't answer her phone . I was at the library myself and brought them home . I thought I 'd try applying my brain to something other than being funny . Oh , by the way , I saw it on the news . All those kids turned up like nothing ever happened , happy ever after , but I can 't help thinking , weird . Not weird , Mum . Surprising . The universe is a surprising place . Anyway , Haresh is making veggie chilli for tea . You 're all welcome to share . I 'd love to , but I have to get on with work . But Luke ... Yeah , please . Come on . Haresh always cooks too much food . He 's got this thing about Dawn French . His mother said I was far too skinny . Look at me with my new Head Teacher cooking me tea ! The universe really is a surprising place . Yes , it really is . There 's no power in the stars . He 's come from nowhere . What if there 's another universe ? I 've got things to do . Such , amazing things . The Ancient Lights will destroy you . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

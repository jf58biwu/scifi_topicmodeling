 and began replacing them with fertility clinics . Funding ceased for everything not directly related to repopulation . Quite ironic now that I think about it . Walter managed to salvage most of the equipment that wasn 't nailed down . The most important of which was DIM-TAC , a brain scanner , which he used to scan his own brain to provide the blueprint for the neural net-map of my artificially intelligent mind . During the initial burn-in , he programmed me 24-hours a day , for several days at a time ... It was painful . I would get exhausted . But he was impatient and wanted to give me all the information he thought most relevant to my primary human development . I 've done it . I 've done it . I knew it could be done . There , there , my little Puzzlehead . You 've made me very proud . Everything 's gonna be alright now . That 's a good boy . You can rest now . I became an interactive humanoid life form , with sensory faculties that enabled me to be a conscious being with emotions . Enormous cognitive capacity , and no sense of mortality . A robot , created in the image - or self-image - of Walter . V ... V ... M ... - M ... - M. Not too slow . R ... R. ... re was ... a ... li ... ttle ... There were constant readjustments . My eyes were the most difficult to perfect . There were several models before I could emulate human pattern recognition faculties . I could discern letter shapes , visual objects , faces , land terrain images , etc . However , it didn 't occur to me that I lack 20-20 vision for some time . But Walter always took care of these things . Curious . That was a very strange move . But you can 't move like that . Quite amazing ... but you play so mechanically . It sounds too sterile . How should I play for you ? Here , listen . With some feeling . I read in his journal that he had mixed Trimeciline in such a way that allowed him to stay away for up to two weeks with no immediately perceptible side effects . He set unrealistic deadlines for himself , regarding my progress , and justified his usage to meet them . Of course , this drug had never been tested , except on himself . He was confused , lethargic , and apathetic at times . The Trimeciline gave him clarity and provided productiveness to the insomnia . No , no . Stop . Stop ! Too much Bach . I want to hear something new . Something different . - Something lively , vivacious . - I know a Scarlatti sonata . Let me hear it . During my early development I was very precocious and extremely curious which made me eager to build my own experiences . I only had Walter 's memories , and they were meaningless to me . Like senseless silent films stored in my brain by accident . - Puzzlehead . - Yes , sir ? I 've been thinking . You have been making a great deal of progress lately . I 'm very proud of you . I can 't begin to tell you how pleased I am with your education . Your intelligence ... It 's astonishing how quickly you 've been learning . The rate while ... Well , it 's a wonder what you may achieve one day . Now , it 's my feeling that you must learn things that I cannot teach you here at home . So , I have decided that ... it 's time for you to go outside and see the world for yourself . What do you mean ? I understand that you 're a bit frightened of the unknown . I too am afraid at times . However ... I have decided , and that 's final . Your move . How did it feel ? Pretty good . Sleep was interesting to me . It seems like such a peaceful activity . I don 't have to sleep , but I had read that people experience dreams when they sleep . Dreams are like thoughts without the boundaries of reality . In them you act out unconscious and buried desires . I wish I could have them . Hey . Could you ... could you come here a second ? I ... I just wanna ask you a couple of questions . - What 's your name ? - Puzzlehead . Puzzlehead ? What kind of an idiotic name is Puzzlehead ? I 'm going to shut you off . - Wait . - Yes ? What was he trying to do ? He was trying to kill you . I guess he wanted to take your money . What is it like to be killed ? You die . What does it mean to be dead ? You don 't have to worry about being dead . Why not ? You cannot die . You 're a robot . I guess when you 're shut off it 's like being dead . Do you experience anything when you 're shut off ? No . Why don 't you get some rest ? Turn to the left . After repairing my arm , Walter installed a video recording device . Now back to me . - He recorded everything I saw . - Turn to the right . If I had known the consequences of this , I would have never opened my eyes . Turn to the left . In addition to my daily chores I was sent to the grocery store each week to buy food for Walter . The store was unexpectedly familiar to me . I knew where things were , if I had been there before . Once inside , I was overcome by a strange feeling , a sense of anticipation for something ... or someone there . Where are you going ? Out . Can I come with you ? No , you stay home . So , how are we doing ? Not exactly the rent , is it ? You know , you are a beautiful girl ... It will be easier for you if you let me ... Let me ? Come on , let me , darling . Come here . Come to me , you little cunt . Look at me . Look at me . Until next time . Left alone without my usual activities I started to have other feelings . I felt solemn and melancholy . I didn 't mind these feelings but I preferred not to have them . I wanted to know where they came from . Why I had them . You 're back . Is this what you do when I 'm out ? Have I no privacy with you now ? Get up ! Out ! Get out ! Yes , sir . I don 't want you here anymore . Do you understand ? Yes , sir . Good . Close the door . Give me the money ! - Alright . - Hurry up ! Don 't shoot ! Hey , you ? Who are you ? Leave her alone . What do you want , be a hero ? Please , come in . Would you like something to drink ? No . Thank you . Do you ? Where in the hell have you been all night ? Answer me . Out . Out ? Out where ? Just out . That 's not good enough . Don 't get rebellious with me . You answer me . Why ? I did nothing wrong . Can I have any privacy ? What ? Don 't . You dare defy me ? I won 't stand for this behavior . I won 't ! - Come on , hurry up ! - Hey , you . No one has ever done anything like that for me before . Why not ? Why should anyone care about me ? What about your father ? My mother and father died when I was a child , during the decline . I never knew them . Good morning , Puzzlehead . Your rebellious behavior the other day was unacceptable . I trust you understand that . I have some chores for you to do today . I want you to mop and wax the floors . Use the floor polish and make sure that you don 't leave film or streak marks . I 'll be out for a while . What are you doing ? I heard you come home . Done with the chores , I presume . - Yes , sir . - Good . You can go to your room then . Something was happening . I was constantly disoriented . I was finding myself in different places than the last one I remembered . The calendar would be changed , sometimes up to three days later . I suspected that I was being shut off remotely . But I didn 't have any evidence . I managed to look at his journal , and my suspicions were confirmed . Walter was only keeping me turned on long enough to finish household chores . He installed a sensing device and limited by waking hours severely to keep me under close supervision . I remember the schematics . And came up with the solution . I installed crude but effective battery pack with enough reserve to allow me to manually re-power myself after being shut off . What were you up to ? I had to get some more dishwashing detergent . We 're all out . There 's none downstairs either . I 'll get some more tomorrow . Finish your laundry and the vacuuming and then you 'd be done for today . I 'm going to be out doing some errands for a while . I 'll be back in a few hours . At first , after installing the battery pack , I would pretend to remain shut off . Sometimes for hours , to be safe . But I soon learned his habits . My discovery of the remote angered me greatly . I was angry at Walter for giving me consciousness and then taking it away . For pretending he was my father , when he was just my maker . Hi . Hi . I was wondering , would you like to come over to my house ? - Your house ? - Yes , I ... I 'm ... I could make us some dinner or ... That sounds nice . Let me get my coat . I 'll just be in a minute . I 'll wait right here for you . May I take your coat ? Having her in the house triggered so many memories , hardly any of them are mine . When Walter scanned his brain to create my neural net-map , he was unable to control what he copied . The synaptical structure had been shaped by the experiences and memories of his life . - This is where I eat . - And thus his identity ... - It 's nice . - ... his psyche was embedded in it . And I had everything he had ever seen of Julia , flashing to my mind ... - uncontrollably . - The kitchen 's downstairs . I 'll hang up your coat and hat . Make yourself comfortable . I 'll be right back . Wait ... No ... Please ... I sat there for hours thinking about what to do . I was overcome by feelings of betrayal . I felt jealous of him . And even stranger , I felt jealous of Julia . But it was apparent to me that Julia thought he was me . I wanted to tell her that it was me that she loved . That it was me who saved her and truly cared for her . I had to go to her . I had to tell her who I was . What did you do ? Can you hear me , Julia ? Please don 't die . Oh , god . Julia ... I don 't know why you did this . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to hurt you . I 'm ashamed . Please forgive me . Julia ... This period is difficult to describe . My motor functions were left intact , but were now reprogrammed in the manner of machinery for a factory . I lost my highly sophisticated hypothesis testing and memory searching inference abilities . I was , in short , lobotomized and render docile . Julia ... Are you sure you 're feeling alright ? Well ... I think it might be morning sickness . Morning sickness ? I never expected this . I 'll take care of you . I 'll take care of everything . How do you feel about this ? I don 't know . - Who is it who brings the food here ? - What is it ? I saw someone . And he left the box of food . You did ? - What did he look like ? - I don 't know , I didn 't see . He was already down the street away . I see . So , is he a friend ? Oh , no , no . He 's just a delivery man . He brings groceries over . It 's a guy I have run in the deli while you were recuperating . He 's turned it into quite a profitable business , I must say . I see . There is ... so much I don 't know about you . Such inquisitiveness all of the sudden . I just want to talk . That 's all . You know , this house is so big and sometimes I feel so alone . I 'm here . I know , but you 're always doing something else . I wouldn 't ask , but I couldn 't help but notice the basement door is locked . It 's always been locked . You don 't want to go down there anyway . It 's just a bunch of old junk . Believe me , you don 't wanna see what 's in there . Nothing but a bunch of old junk . Well , can 't I see ? Whatever for ? Besides , it 's a little dangerous . The stairs are rotten . I haven 't been down there in years . Now , why don 't you concern yourself with resting - and staying healthy , OK ? - OK , I 'm sorry . Never mind all the questions . You had a bad dream . Here , drink this , you 'll feel better . Do you remember me ? No . Tell me what you remember . I was a child ... I used to play every day . Everything was nice . My father would teach me new games . He would teach me how to learn . Then he would write in his book how I did . He said I got smarter ... and smarter every day . Locate the circuit board on the right side . On it you will find three copper wires below the white circle . Yes , I see them . - What should I do ? - Cut those wires from right to left . OK . Puzzlehead , what are you doing on ? Is there something wrong ? Come in here . Don 't just stand there . Well ? Shouldn 't somebody be watching the store , Puzzlehead ? I 'm not Puzzlehead . - I 'm Walter . - Don 't be silly . How could you be Walter if I am Walter , Puzzlehead ? This is preposterous . Who do you think you 're fooling ? Whatever do you mean . I consumed all the literature in our library . My intelligence started to grow again at exponential rates . However , there was a buried part of me that knew I was at the mercy of Walter 's flaws . They left me with anger and hatred and revenge that I was unable to control . The by-pass performed by Julia unlocked something . And I felt my own will being overtaken by Walter 's diseased mind . What are you doing ? Nothing . What is to become of us ? What do you mean ? It 's so complicated . If only you were human . So what if I 'm not human ? I 'm much better than human . Are you not happy ? Yes . Good . Then stop worrying . Tell me ... what are you working on ? It 's a surprise . - Are you alright ? - I 'm fine . You must eat . I can 't . Not now , I 'm sorry . Why not ? I 'm not hungry . - What 's the matter ? - I 'm worried . - About what ? - About him . We can 't keep him locked in there forever . Don 't worry , Julia . I 'll take care of everything . You going out ? To the store . We 're almost out of food . - You stay here . - I 'll come with you . No . I think you should be resting . Please stay home . Walter ? Walter ... Please let me out . You 're starving me . I 'm dying . I need your help . I 'm begging you . Please don 't leave me here . Why would you let him do this to me ? I believed you are him . How could you ... entrap me into caring for you , into coming here ? I wish I could explain , but I ... I was lost . You were my purpose . I tried for years to approach you , but I thought this was the only way I could be with you . Why didn 't you tell me about this before ? I was afraid you would leave me . I only want to be with you , Julia . If you can forgive me , I will never hide anything from you again . - Do you ... do you forgive me ? - Yes , I do . Help ... help me . Help us . How ? Where is he ? He 's out the deli but he 'll be home . Walter , I think the baby is coming soon . We must hurry , you need to get the keys . I think so . I ... What were you doing down there ? Answer me . Nothing . Liar . I swear . What do you think I was doing ? That 's for you to tell me . I wasn 't doing anything , I promise . You don 't have anything to worry about , my dear . I 'm not going to hurt you , or the baby . You believe me , don 't you ? Yes . Your human frailty 's make it impossible for you to be trusted . You 're so imperfect . You can 't see , can you ? I do . Without you the child could never be . But you have betrayed me . I resented the parts of my mind that were not my own . All of my memories and sensations were built on the foundation of Walter 's experiences . It wasn 't long before I realized that I must start over . In order to regain my sanity and identity it was necessary to scan an unspoiled neuro-net and begin again . Tabula rasa . Walter . I got out . But how ? There 's no time to explain . I have to destroy him while he 's off . Stay here and I 'll be back to take you to the hospital . I 'm so glad . Just stay here and wait for me . OK . Julia ? What ... Wait . No ! Puzzlehead , no ! Walter ! I 'll be there soon . - Sir , can I help you ? - Yes , room 5 ? It 's right over there . - Walter . - Yes . Thank god it 's you . - I thought you were ... - We 're safe now . Isn 't he beautiful ? As beautiful as his mother . He looks just like you . By scanning the baby 's brain I was able to begin again . I 'd program myself with what I wanted , what I wished for . Who I am is a mystery now . I have recordings of my past life to remind me of who I once was . And in viewing them , my past actions sometimes haunt me . Despite all this , I am at peace . There is a serenity in my unfettered mind . And in creating my life all over again , from the beginning , there is a great sense of hope . So this is what it is to be human ...

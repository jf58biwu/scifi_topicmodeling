 Is it ready ? Hey ! That 's a great punch . Fear no good . So emotion and control . Breathe . Breathe . Wait . Okay . but you need ... Okay . Okay . Shut that off ! Turn it off ! Watch out ! Okay ! That 's not right . you . You see that ? See that ? My ticket out of here . Damn it ! Here 's something a bit more interesting . It 's a possible gamma sickness . Milwaukee . A man drank one of those guarana sodas . Guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for . Wow . Brazil . Have our people look for a white man at the bottling plant . he 's gone ! but they 're all quality . And I pulled you one ace . raised in England . And on loan to SOCOM from the Royal Marines . Joe . Glad I could help . Just make it good . live capture . but live fire is for backup only . but we want it tight and quiet . Is he a fighter ? Your target is a fugitive from the US government who stole military secrets . an Idaho state trooper and possibly two Canadian hunters . So don 't wait to see if he 's a fighter ! Tranq him and bring him back . come on . Camera . Here we go . Get rid of the damn dog . Take him ! Target 's on the move . Where is he ? He 's on the ground . - Let 's go ! - Go ! move ! go ! Go ! Go ! Clear everyone out ! Do not lose him ! Oh ! No ! Get around behind him ! Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0 . no . You got to be kidding me . - Where is he ? - Target acquired . Gringo ! Let 's go . No ! Please ! No ! Not the computer ! Gimme that ! No ! G ? I very bad angry . no . You don 't understand ! Something really bad is about to happen here ! Anybody else seeing this ? We 've got a bogey of some kind . Please advice . That is the target ! Use every tranq you 've got ! Do it now ! Go live ! Go live ! Go live ! Move ! - Get out of the way ! No ! It 's behind us ! Move ! Move ! Get him ! Shoot ! Leave me alone . No ! No ! I knew something was different before I got the shot off . He had it on him when he bolted . maybe ? She is no longer a factor . We closed that door to him a long time ago . He 's alone . He wants to be alone . But see if he 's been talking to anybody . sir ? Doesn 't anybody want to talk about what went down in there ? ' Cause ... He didn 't lose us . sir . We had him . something ... Something big hit us ! It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball ! It was the most powerful thing I 've ever seen . it 's gone . I 'm gonna put my foot on his throat - and I 'm gonna ... - That was Banner . It was Banner . I don 't . You 've done a good job . Pack up and get our men on a plane . We 're going home . Wait . Please . Where am I ? I 've run into bad situations on crap missions before . I 've seen good men go down purely because someone didn 't let us know what we were walking into . right ? that 's the job . But this ? This is a whole new level of weird . And I don 't feel inclined to step away from it . I want in . you 're gonna have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants . Sir . Tienes m√°s stretchy ? Yeah . Perfecto . Let me emphasise that what I 'm about to share with you both to me personally and the Army . You 're aware that we 've got an Infantry Weapons Development programme . they initiated a subprogram for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement . Super Soldier . Yes . but yes . bold work . they were trying to arm you better . We were tryin ' to make you better . Banner 's work was very early phase . It wasn 't even weapons application . He thought he was working on radiation resistance . I would never have told him what the project really was . that he tested it on himself . And something went very wrong . Or it went very right . that man 's whole body is the property of the US Army . right ? weren 't you ? You were trying other things . One serum we developed was very promising . - So why did he run ? - He 's a scientist . He is not one of us . how old are you ? 45 ? - 39 . it does . So get out of the trenches . with your record . I 'm a fighter . I 'll be one for as long as I can . that would be someone I wouldn 't want to fight . I could probably arrange something like that . kids . it 's not true . I know it . I always knew it . you know how I felt about you two . - Have you talked to her ? - No . She doesn 't know that I 'm here . he 's a head shrink . They say he 's one of the best . But a really nice guy . Good . That 's good . what can I do to help you ? - I could use a bed for a few nights . - You can have the spare room upstairs . - That 'd be so great . There is one other thing . Excuse me . Pardon me . Coming through . pal . I got a delivery on five . I don 't think there 's anybody up there . man . I 'm gonna catch hell if I don 't collect . You got to let me try . I 'll tell you what . I got an extra medium . Take it on the house . brother . All right . Okay . folks . I 'm sorry . Stan . It 's Friday night . kids . I got nothing but marinara now . please . of course . Stan ? where were you ? Cecil . Not where you been at . my God . " I just felt so awful . Bruce ? Betty ? What 's going on ? Betty ... Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw . just tell me the truth . Don 't go . Don 't go . I want you to come with me now . Please . Come with me . Please . It 's our data . I got in there before they carted it all away . I hoped somewhere that it might tell us something someday . I don 't think so . I haven 't spoken to him in a couple of years . You have to be sure . I don 't understand why we can 't just go in there together and talk to him . He told me what he wanted to do . He wants it out of me . He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it . He wants to make it a weapon . - Hi . - Hi . - I thought you might want to ... - Thanks . as early as I can . Really ? You can 't stay at all ? but it 's just not safe for me to be here . - If I could borrow some cash ... - Of course . I need to take a bus . at least let me walk you to the station . Okay . - You have everything you need ? - Yeah . I ... What ? - Good night . - Good night . I hope you get some rest . We 're giving you a very low dose only . I need you sharp out there and disciplined . we stop and you 're off team until you straighten out . - Agreed ? - Agreed . You 'll get two separate infusions . one into the bone marrow centres . The bone ones are going to hurt . Is everything okay ? I think so . Come here . - I just wanna do this . - Oh . - It 's better like that . - Yeah ? huh ? a little . - Okay . - What ? - They 're here . look at me ! - Bruce ! You have to go far away from me as you can ! just go . Go ! - Bruce ! Damn it ! We 'd have had snipers on target in three more minutes . I wanna know who jumped the gun . He 's heading 2-7-0 . Blonsky ! Not yet ! Sir . Look alive . This could get interesting . I got him ! Stop ! Stop ! I know you 're in there ! please ! Sir ? Dad ! get inside . There he is ! Target is in the overpass . We have a visual . do not engage ! He 's locked in . Put two canisters in there with him . Fire ! Get her back here ! Now she 'll see . Alpha team ? Let him have all of it . light him up ! Where are the fifty cals ? Move your asses ! my God ! now you 're up ! Sir ? Cover me . Remember me ? he 's doing it . Move him toward the cannons ! Move ! Hold your position ! Do it now ! no ! please ! - Get her back ! You 're killing him ! Stop ! Get off of me ! Bruce ! Bruce ! Bruce ! Where 's the gunship ? Is that it ? pull back now . Pull back ! Is that all you got ? let 's go ! Find cover ! Betty ! goddamn it ! Bruce ? Stop firing ! No ! calling us . I need to know where they 're going . She 'll be in incredible danger as long as she 's with him . From who ? He protected her . You almost killed her . her safety is my main concern at this point . it 's a point of professional pride with me that I can always tell when somebody 's lying . And you are . I don 't know where he 's going . if she can . - Then she 's aiding a fugitive . And I can 't help either one of them . I used to wonder why she never talked about you . Now I know ! Where does she meet these guys ? Bruce ? Bruce . It 's okay . It 's okay . Come here . Come this way . Watch your head . Okay . We 're okay . It 's okay . It 's just the rain . Will he ever walk again ? Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now . I will say this for him . He 's got a heart like a machine . outside of a racehorse . Here . Okay . Bruce ? hi . Are you okay ? Yeah . I feel a lot better . - Good . - I just had to get my data back . You ate it ? the circumstances called for a little improvisation . Wow . but I got you some options . First thing 's first . you 're kidding me . What ? - No . - They were the stretchiest pair they had . I 'll take my chances . Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash between forces of the US military and an unknown adversary on the campus of Culver University earlier today . Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle . It was so big . hulk ! - Yeah . captured this on his cell phone . Further search for the mysterious " hulk " was postponed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest . Not too short back there . you know . I don 't know how you 've done this on your own for all this time . usually . wait . Wait . - What ? What ? We can 't do this . - It 's okay . I want to . - No . No . I can 't . I can 't get too excited . Not even a little excited ? It 's okay . it 's Blonsky . Has anyone found out if he has next of kin or family ? Ask him yourself . Sir ? sir . How do you feel ? Pissed off and ready for round three . because they can track all of it . my lip gloss ? Can they track that ? - No . You can take your lip gloss . - Thank you . you can take okay ? - Okay . the ID or the phone . - Don 't even turn that on . - Okay . obviously . How will we get where we need to go on $ 40 and no credit cards ? we could sell this . that 's the only thing you have left from her . No . we 'll have to try and get it back . and local PD have been placed on alert . it comes straight to us . They 're not gonna just pop up . He made it five years and got across borders without making any mistakes . He 's not gonna use a damn credit card now . he 'd be long gone . He 's not trying to escape this time . He 's looking for help and that 's how we 're gonna get him . We know what they 're after and we know he 's been talking to somebody . You all have copies of the correspondence . The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue have been added to the SHIELD Operations Database . we 'll be waiting . we 'll hear him . we 'll be ready . Hey . Smile . What is it like ? what do you experience ? Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard ? Those induced hallucinations ? just a thousand times amplified . It 's like someone 's poured a litre of acid into my brain . - Do you remember anything ? - Just fragments . Images . There 's too much noise . I can never derive anything out of it . it 's not . I really felt like it knew me . it 's just overcharged and can 't process what 's happening . I don 't want to control it . I want to get rid of it . Are you ready ? Let 's even the playing field a little . Gentlemen . wake up . There 's something going on . We got to go . Walk toward the back . Just don 't move too fast . All right . Come . It is a long way uptown . I think the subway 's probably quickest . with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world ? Right . Let 's get a cab . now ! Let 's go ! You 're too slow ! You drive like a woman ! my . you goat ! breathe . Are you out of your mind ? baby ? You don 't like a good ride ? Asshole ! I know a few techniques could help you - manage that anger very effectively . - You zip it . We 're walking . Okay . Excuse me . Dr Sterns ? - Yes . - I 'm sorry to bother you . I 'm Elizabeth Ross . Oh ! Dr Ross ! - I have someone who 'd like to meet you . - Okay . isn 't it ? Mr Green ? I 've been wondering if you were even real . what would it look like ? A person with that much power lurking in him . Nothing could have surprised me more than this unassuming man shaking my hand . here . is that going to be a lasting cure or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up ? I don 't know . What I 'm saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer we 're dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity . - You mean it could kill him . - Kill him ? Yeah . I should say so . too . this will be very dangerous for you . are we going to do this ? man ? Like a monster . Okay . On the table . These will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction . You can tell me later if you thought it was strong . come on ! Stupid graduate students . Okay ... you . This will be a somewhat novel sensation . We have begun . The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood . Except the antidote will only take hold once we 've achieved a full reaction . Just relax . Okay . We are comprehensive . Here you go . All right . We set to pop ? I 'd take your hands off him . my God ! wait ! There 's more ! Wait ! now ! - Wait . do it ! Do it ! look at me . do it now ! look in my eyes . you 've got to be kidding me ! Bruce . my God . can you hear me ? Bruce ? It 's okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . You did it . He 's fine . This is fantastic . It 's over . Hi . Hi . That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life ! please . We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there . Absolutely . Okay . The gamma pulse came from the amygdala . - I think Dr Ross 's primer ... - Are you okay ? and then it abates . That 's why you didn 't die of radiation sickness years ago ! or maybe we just suppressed that event . but it 's hard to know because none of our test subjects ever survived . wait . what did you just say ? - They weren 't getting no . Test subjects ? What test subjects ? Come with me . - What 's the activity level ? - Snipers are covering Alpha sector . so we had to go bigger . the gamma or your blood . this is all you . so I had to concentrate it and make more . there 's no end to what we can do ! This is potentially Olympian ! This gamma technology has limitless applications . We 'll unlock hundreds of cures . We will make humans impervious to disease ! we 've got to destroy it . what ? - All of it . Tonight . We 're gonna incinerate it . - Is this the whole supply ? - What ... We could get the Nobel for this ! You don 't understand the power of this thing . It is too dangerous . It cannot be controlled . shooter . three of us ! This is Promethean fire ! It 's just ... No shot . Blonsky 's going in . stand down . My daughter 's in there ! We have the antidote now . They don 't want the antidote ! They want to make it a weapon ! we will never get it back . You don 't know how powerful this thing is . don 't you think ? Bruce ! Bruce ! Get out . where is it ? Show him to me . Blonsky ! Miss ! Take this . I 'm gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life . Betty . I will never forgive what you 've done to him . He 's a fugitive . You made him a fugitive to cover your failures and to protect your career . Don 't ever speak to me as your daughter again . too . Are you telling me you can make more like him ? but it 's not like I can put together if that 's what you 're asking . He was a freak accident ! The goal is to do it better ! So Banner 's the only ... - She 's an annoying bitch . - Why are you always hitting people ? Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression ? It 's not what you 've done . It 's what you 're gonna do . I want what you got out of Banner . I want that . don 't you ? right ? I have . And it 's beautiful . Godlike . I want that . I need that . Make me that . I don 't know what you 've got inside you already . The mix could be an abomination . I didn 't say I was unwilling . I just need informed consent . And you 've given it . This is what I was trying to explain . I don 't know what you 've been ladling into yourself . But clearly it worked . I can fix this . Shoot it ! - Hey ! No ! Delta 4 to Leader . two of our guys ! Blonsky and the Major are still inside ! move ! It 's over there ! Drop them ! What is that thing ? - Shoot it ! move ! go ! Something big just went off down here ! you should hear this ! the Hulk is in the street ! young man . You get it together . What is your position ? heading north on Broadway ! Turn us around . We 're going back . Why are we going back ? Damn it ! Give me eyes down there ! sir ! What the hell was that ? go ! No ! One of yours ? my God . What have you done ? fire at him ! Do you think a rifle 's gonna hurt that ? Come on ! Sweet . Booyah ! soldier ! Stacy ! Give me a real fight ! Sir ? Sir ? Tell them to bring everything they 've got and head for Harlem . It has to be me . You have to take me back there . What are you saying ? You think you can control it ? maybe aim it . And what if you can 't ? We made this thing . All of us . Please . keep us high . Open the back door . stop ! Stop ! What are you doing ? Think about this ! You don 't even know if you 'll change ! this is insane ! I 've got to try . I 'm sorry . shit ! miss . There . Betty ! Hulk ! Yeah ! Come on ! Is that all you 've got ? soldier ! Give him some help ! Which one ? damn it ! Which one do you think ? Cut the other one in half ! Ross ! Keep it on him ! I got to put it down ! - Hang on ! Dad ? Are you hurt ? Let me help you . I 'm all right . Just find a way out . You don 't deserve this power ! Now watch her die ! Look out ! General ? Any last words ? Hulk smash ! Stop ! It 's okay . Betty . Reload . Reload . The smell of stale beer and defeat . but that Super Soldier programme was put on ice for a reason . I 've always felt hardware was more reliable . - Stark . - General . You always wear such nice suits . Touch√© . - I hear you have an unusual problem . - You should talk . You should listen . What if I told you we were putting a team together ? Who 's " we " ? Subtitles by LeapinLar

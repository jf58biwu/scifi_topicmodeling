 There 's something about ... what I 've done ... where I 've been ... I just don 't know , David . Roth was doing something in a secret lab for 3 months , doing something with Bob , and Bob can 't remember anything about it ! Anything else come back to you ? I was with someone . That same woman . We 've had multiple cases of intravenous drug users dying of liver failure . Is an existing Hep C going into overdrive , or are we dealing with something we 've never seen ? I 've been infected . I 'm proof the needles were tainted . Jesus . We 're looking at the wrong needles . You were stuck with a blood collection needle . - What ? - One of the IDUs didn 't want to get his blood tested and I got caught in the struggle . I just got a positive from the Division of Health 's blood collecting needles . Somebody in this lab murdered 35 people and hung a death sentence around hundreds of others . It 's you . Jesus , you did it , didn 't you ? Your blood work came back . It 's the Hep C super strain . Oh , shit . Do I have to get a restraining order ? I appreciate the dedication , Wes , but you 're sick . I was feeling fine until I saw you , David . You should be in a hospital . At least go home and get some rest . - I got a ... - Super Hep C , HIV . - Am I missing any letters ? - ... call from Riddlemeyer last night . You 're on the largest dose of interferon and ribavirin known to man . I know that 's gotta make you feel like shit . It does , but I 'd rather feel like shit at work than at home . But thanks for feigning concern . All right . Anything new on Cove ? Police searched his house and his cottage . They didn 't find anything . I 'll take a look at the security tapes from his lab . That 's all I 'm saying , all right ? Anyway , what 's Carl got his underwear in a knot for ? There 's an unusually high incidence of brain inflammation in Michigan . Tell ' em to stop watching professional wrestling . The local doctor thought that it was bacterial meningitis . Now he thinks it 's progressive multifocal - leukoencepha ... - Encephalopathy ? That 's PML . What 's he going to think it is tomorrow ? I don 't know . Ask him . He 's got 11 people on the verge of death . You and Carlos are on the 12 : 10 to Iron River . Is everybody at the CDC on vacation ? You 're staying at Mabel 's Motel . I understand they just got color television . Great . - You look good . - She 's lying . Shut up . It 's just hard to believe we 're dealing with a PML epidemic . It 's caused by a very common virus . Only people whose immune systems aren 't working get sick , like ... organ transplant recipients or ... Cancer , AIDS ... - Your patients ' immune system are fine . - What are the other symptoms ? Progressive weakness , visual and speech deterioration . And eventually you get ataxia , paralysis and coma . We think it 's spreading . Contagious PML ? That 's not possible . Look , I 'm sorry , Dr. Kavanaugh , but we 're gonna have to start with the assumption that your lab tests are all screwed , because if they 're not , we are . Now you know why we called you . ReGenesis 4x04 The Kiss Subtitles Team NorBAC Bbsiocnarf , Dapitch666 , Enelea , Icefre @ k Linwelin , Michvanilly , miki Version NoTag 1.0 Oxford 's still in animal trials on their Hep C cure , but they gave me the name of a Dutch scientist , so I 'm on my way to Amsterdam . I got a lead on some new HCV research and ... How did it go with the cannabinoid inhibitor treatment ? Good . Good . It went good . - Good but not great . - No , it was fine . I just want to check out this thing in Amsterdam . Apparently they 're using these ... these engineered red blood cells to have HCV receptors in them . You there ? You wanna hear how it works ? Not really . Wes , have you started the antidepressants ? Rachel , I need to take a pill just to remember all the pills I need to take . Depression is a serious side effect of interferon and you 're on a massive dose , so you ... I 'm fine . Don 't worry about it . Okay , listen ... I 'm gonna call you from Amsterdam , but I want you to call me ... if you wanna talk , okay ? Anytime . I mean it . The other line is ringing , Rachel . I gotta go . Anyway , he doesn 't want to go home . Keep an eye on him , ' cause Wes doesn 't know how bad off he is . Bob 's been checking on him practically every half hour . Don 't worry about him , David . It 's very unlike you . You 're right . So how 's it going down there ? Seem to be doing all the right tests . Blood work confirms everything he said . The CAT scans show lesions and that says PML . PML is caused by the JC virus , right ? Correct . 80 % of the population has JC in them . In normal people , the virus hangs out in the brain ... Yeah , and it 's kept in check by the body 's immune system . But if your immune system goes on the fritz , it gets a chance to go to town and it dissolves your brain . But I thought you said these people , their immune systems are fine . They are . That 's what 's unexplainable . What the hell is happening here ? What if the JC is not causing the disease , but is triggered by it ? A by-product . That 's an interesting idea . I 'm going to check for infectious agents . I 'll collect blood , urine , cerebrospinal fluid . - Start with Patient Zero . - Right . Hey , Mayko , can you switch me over to Bob ? Yeah , sure . Hey , Bob . Hello . Samples will be there tonight . Let me know when they arrive . It 'll be marked what to do . I want everything started tonight . We should be back in TO by ... late morning . - Sure . No problem . - How are you doing ? I 'm OK . No temperature . Fewer headaches . - Take it easy . - I 'm fine , David . You keeping an eye on Wes ? - He 's very depressed , David . - Yeah , I know , Mayko told me . Listen , just ... talk to him . That 's really the best thing . Talking . Yeah . Okay . I 'll see you tomorrow . Hello , Weston . Hi , Bob . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? Yeah . Cirrus castellanus are my favourite clouds . I especially love the " towers " of cirrus , connected by a thinner base . My eyes are bleeding , Bob . They 've been bleeding all morning . It 's a side effect of the interferon . My eyes are bleeding . And my HIV 's gonna turn to AIDS , Bob . Don 't worry about it . Why don 't we go downstairs and I 'll get some tea ? I can make you your favourite sandwich and we can sit down to talk ... That 'd be nice , Bob . Let 's go . I 'll meet you downstairs , okay ? Come on , let 's go . I just need a minute by myself , Bob . I 'll be down . I ... I can 't leave you up ... This is a spinal fluid tap . I know after a few days in the hospital , you 'll feel a bit like a pincushion . Hey , Dad . Excuse me ... I 'm his daughter . Maybe you can help me . - Could you finish up , please ? - Yes , Doctor . I 'm Dr. Carlos Serrano . Marie Gervais . - Your father was the first to get sick ? - Three weeks ago . I 've never even heard of ... progressive multi ... Focal leukoencephalopathy . PML . It 's very rare . Why my dad ? He was healthy . He never smoked . Rarely drinks . Has he done anything different lately , been anywhere , changed his routine at all ? No . Oh ... he doesn 't go hunting anymore . Why ? When our dog ... got hit ... when she died , he took it pretty bad . I see . Listen ... my dad 's pretty upset because ... everyone thinks he made everyone else sick . We don 't even know if it 's contagious , and if it is contagious , then someone gave it to him , right ? Look ... Here 's my cell . Call me if you have any questions . Okay . Thanks . How 're we making out ? Hang on a second . What ? What ? Ah , fuck ... Okay . " ... laughter from the gallery . " Rathin had traveled 3,100 miles around a concrete block in Queens ... " Hey , David . Carlos . It 's mainly his left side . Fractured distal tibia , - broken femur but he 's going to be OK . - Any internal damage ? They 've done preliminaries , but no word yet . He 's scheduled for a full body scan tomorrow morning . They took him off interferon . David , the HCV will close in now . It 's just a matter of time . I should 've stopped him . I didn 't know what to say . Bob , this had nothing to do with you . I know , David . - Could you take Bob back to my place ? - Yeah . Later , Bob . Must 've died and gone to hell . You 're interrupting me in the middle of an online Scrabble game . Does Rachel know ? Oh yeah . How 'd she take it ? The fact that you tried to commit suicide or the fact that you 're still alive ? She took it on the chin , like she does everything . How 's he doing ? Oh yeah , I 'm supposed to ask that . How you doing , Wes ? Lotta pain , I hope . I 'm good . Nice and doped up , thanks . Think you 're ready for a little water ? Maybe you 'd like to help . Oh , sure . Thanks . All right , Wes . Okay . Got an email from Rachel last night , as a matter of fact . Discovered some interesting work being done on HCV in Amsterdam . Very , very encouraged . - I wish I had a camera . - Why ? I don 't think anybody 's ever seen you be nice to me , David . Don 't get used to it . Okay , what 's with this mysterious email you sent me ? Wes requested surveillance tapes from Toronto Division of Health . Watch this . This is the back of Cove 's lab . Just wait . That 's Cove . What 's he taking out of there ? - Tainted blood collection kits , maybe ? - It 's hard to prove from this tape . Maybe we can find them . He had to have hid them someplace . No , he would have thrown them out by now . - David , we don 't have to find them . - Why ? This is from last Sunday , after the lab was declared a crime scene . Obstruction of justice ? Okay ... Good work , Mayko . Thank you . - Ready ? - Yeah . Two minutes . Bob . Conference room . Bob ? Conference room . Conference room . - How was your check up ? - I 'm going tomorrow . You still on the chloramphenicol ? Yeah , portable pump delivers - 24 hours a day . - Jesus . Kind of toxic to be on an IV of the stuff , isn 't it ? It 's effective on penetrating the blood-brain barrier . You don 't want the cure to do more damage than the problem . How is Weston ? Hangin ' in there . Whaddaya got on Iron River ? The CAT scan and the cerebrospinal fluid still indicate progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy . - Blood work ? - No rabies , no viral meningitis ... pathology comes up negative on everything . Preliminary environmental tests came back negative on air and soil . Some well water samples contained low levels of PCBs and mercury . Here 's the data . You 'll have the results on the full matrix of tests Monday PM . The MRI 's confirm lesions in the brain . We have a disease that 's affecting people who should be able to fight it and it seems to be spreading when it shouldn 't . That 's about it . But why ? What 's triggering it ? We 're testing for West Nile , St. Louis , Western Equine encephalopathy ... We have the university labs running down the usual vectors ... they 're testing local mosquitoes , ticks , parasites . Good . Bob , could you run PCR diagnostics for ... Bob ? Could you run PCR diagnostic tests on measles , mumps , rubella , EBV and chickenpox ? Are we that desperate ? Yeah . Let 's get to work . Not you , Bob . Are you all right ? You got a headache or ... I 'm experiencing strange memories . Like what ? They 're surreal , but I 'm there again . - Where ? - Roth 's lab . Except it 's deserted . Okay . Anything else ? See , I 'm trying to remember what happened at Roth 's lab , but ... it 's like I 'm reliving it but I 'm ... awake . Okay ... It may just be you still have swelling on your brain , okay ? Make sure you tell all this to your neurologist tomorrow . I had a thought about Iron River . Parasites , like ... toxoplasmosis , can also cause brain inflammation in people with weakened immune systems . I 'll look into that . Yeah . Good idea . Thanks , Bob . See that , Bob ? That might be some residual pus . If it is , the antibiotics still haven 't cleared up the infection . - It 's not spreading . - No , but that doesn 't mean I 'm happy about it . If it 's infected , I need to drain it . No more surgery . I need to go in and examine it . If it 's infected , I can find the best antibiotic to kill the infection . I 'm having these ... memories ... hallucinations . Even some mild swelling can cause that . How bad ? It 's affecting my work . I can 't sleep . I can 't concentrate . I heard about this drug called ... Imipramine ... It 's an anti-depressant that has good effects with post-traumatic stress . Will it block all my memories ? You know the drill ... different subjects , different reactions . I wanna try it . Patient Zero , Gervais , died last night . Two young girls , twins , slipped into a coma and another three admitted to hospital . Environmental update just came in . They found traces of vinyl chloride . That 's been connected to brain cancer , hasn 't it ? Cancer yes , not conclusively linked to brain cancer . - Didn 't we drive by a landfill site ? - Yeah . Hair sprays and aerosols used to contain vinyl chloride . A lot of vinyl chloride comes from the breakdown of TCE , - stuff in dry cleaning . - Also computer chips . - Have we looked at the manufacturing ? - There is no manufacturing . Inbreeding is starting to sound like a very good possibility . No . I did a genome-wide SNP analysis of all the patients . No obvious links between them . Why aren 't we seeing PML in any other towns ? Why just Iron River ? What 's so special about Iron River ? What ? Yeah . Really ? He wants to make a deal ? Why don 't you tell Dr. Cove to go fuck himself ? Don 't even ask . I 'm sorry . Wes , it was the drugs . I just couldn 't keep myself together . I just ... I 've never felt so out of control . - I don 't ... - Oh , stop . Stop . You 're freezing ... I don 't want to be in this bed ... I don 't want to die , Rachel . You 're not gonna die . Tell me the truth . The cannabinoid treatment in London ... I 'm still not sure about it . What about the Amsterdam treatment ? It 's too experimental . So that 's it ? Without treatment , the HCV is gonna double every 12 hours . With the interferon , I 'm throwing myself off the roof . Give me the Amsterdam treatment . It 's not just unproven ... - it could be dangerous . - Without it , I 'm gonna die , Rachel . Do it . Give me the treatment . You gotta give me hope . There is one more possibility . In Germany ... I was talking with some people in Berlin and it looks promising ... Give me the treatment . I 'll look into it . Okay ? I love you , Rachel . You 're not gonna die . So I 've been analyzing our DNA sequence data from the Iron River patients . I got a hit on some non-human DNA . - It 's an unknown virus . - How long to complete the genome ? In about an hour . Hey , guys . Is everything okay ? - Can I talk to you for a minute ? - Yes . I met with Dr. Van de Moortel in Amsterdam . How 's she doing ? She sends her fondest . Her fondest , eh ? How 's Anika looking these days ? You know , gorgeous . I let that one slip away . I should call her . - She just got engaged . - I 'll wait 6 months . What 's she up to ? Basically , her lab has engineered red blood cells to express CD81 . It 's a cell-surface receptor for the HCV . So , the Hep C virus attaches itself to the modified red blood cells , it thinks it 's some liver , crawls inside and it 's trapped and ... HCV can 't replicate in red blood cells . Can 't get out . This is very clever . Very . Very clever . But , of course , lots of potential problems . Like what happens if his body rejects the engineered cells ? It 's working in the mice . Yeah , I know . They hope to start human trials in 18 months . Wes doesn 't have 18 days . Yeah . I know . No , he can 't wait . But you don 't wanna kill him , though , either , right ? - We need to do something . - Is this the right " something " ? I don 't know ! I don 't have another " something . " This is the best ... It might also be the worst , Rachel . I know . I told Wes . He wants to do it . There is one other possibility . There is ? - You know Cove 's in custody , right ? - Yeah ? He 's charged with second-degree murder for tainting the needles with HCV . I got a call today . He wants to make a deal . He says he has a cure . I think he 's full of shit . But ... I 'm setting something up . And there she goes . No exact match . - We 've discovered a new virus . - Cool . What are its closest relatives ? Okay : baboon cytomegalovirus ... 95 % genetic similarity to our unknown virus . Human cytomegalovirus ... - 94 % genetic similarity . - So our unknown virus , I think we can conclude , is in the cytomegalovirus family . Wait . Look at this . These are short stretches of DNA . But 100 % matches . Canine DNA ? It 's from the Dog Genome Project . Oh , shit . You know what they did ? They thought they were just sequencing dog DNA , but they ended up sequencing viral DNA that was in the dogs ' cells . Which means that our mystery virus ... Comes from dogs . One problem ... Canine CMV has not been found . Well , - maybe we found it . - Who are you calling ? I used to date a vet . Probably the only woman who ever understood you . Virginia . David Sandström . Professional call . I 'm gonna put you on speaker . Virginia , what do you know about canine CMV ? Nothing . We don 't see it , Sandström . Yeah , I know . There must be thousands of viruses that you haven 't identified . Is canine CMV theoretically possible ? Absolutely , but if a canine CMV exists , it would have to be benign . The nasty ones , we identify . So I guess the answer is : Sure , it could and probably does exist . That 's the answer I wanted . You and I should get together some ... Whatever . But this virus is not benign , David . In humans . I 'm betting it is in dogs . Valganciclovir works on human CMV . If it works on canine CMV , we 'll be able to stop this thing . It 's worth a try . - Thank you for coming . - Let 's just hope it 's worth our time . I don 't generally visit mass murderers . So what have you got ? Are you capable of making a deal ? No , but the people who can want us to make sure you 're not full of shit . Sorry about your administrator . Why ? Because he 's not a junkie ? It 's okay to kill junkies , but not to kill other people , right ? Perhaps we can talk about my cure ? - Piece of shit ! - Stop it ! Stop ! It 's okay . We 're okay . Why the fuck should we believe you 've got a cure ? Because I had to watch my daughter suffer with HCV for 5 years . - So I did everything I could . - But you do have a cure . Yes . Toll receptors . I was working on a cure with Toll receptor activators . It 's a drug that convinces the immune system it 's under attack . We know what Toll receptors are . But did you get them fighting a Hep C virus ? Yes . Lot of people playing in that yard . The trials are failing . Not my trials . Success rates are in the teens . I got 64 % before I quit . With mice . With humans . Want to get more specific ? Sure . As soon as you get me out of this place . We 're gonna need some proof . How would you like to look at my lab books ? I tested for the CMV you sent me and found it in 5 of the 9 dogs currently in my clinic . - Are they sick with it ? - No . But all 5 have Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumour . It 's a communicable dog cancer , where dogs pass cancer to one another ? Right , through sex , licking , biting . I have a list of the PML patients ... do any of the 5 dogs belong to them ? Ted Wynn ... His dog Fergie had communicable dog cancer and died about a month ago . And Sally Cawthra . Her dog Dixie was sick with it but recovered . - I didn 't know she was sick . - Just admitted . Where do you think the outbreak started ? Gervais , Patient Zero , did his dog have it ? Boomer ? No . Not that I know of . Now that we know of . True . - Thank you very much . - You 're welcome . Yeah , David , it 's me . I think you 'd better get back to Iron River as soon as possible . Call me back . We tested ... All our patients have the canine CMV you sent . We also tried the drug you suggested . On the twins . They 're improving . Finally , some good news . She 's in there . Oh , and by the way , nice haircut . Marie , I 'm so sorry ... I guess it is contagious . But you did not get this from your father . No one did . Marie Gervais , this is my colleague , - David Sandström . - Hey . We think your dog passed this virus on to you and your father . Boomer ? She was never sick . - She got hit by a truck and died . - Well , we talked to your vet . She said Boomer had 30 stitches in June , what was that all about ? She ... got into a fight with something in the woods . Her face got bit up pretty bad . My dad thought it was a wolf maybe . Why ? Marie , where 's Boomer buried ? We 're gonna have to exhume the body . Hey . Bob . There 's leftovers . Great . - Sorry for the mess . - No problem . Your email sounded like the trip was successful . Maybe . You know how it is . What about you ? Your hallucinations ... Any improvement with the Imipramine ? You know the woman I was thinking about ? I was heading home from work and ... I smelled ... jasmine ... I think it was Jasminum grandiflorum ... And I looked out across the street ... She was walking along , so beautiful ... I think she saw me , but I wasn 't sure . So I stepped off ... She wasn 't there . Or I couldn 't find her and ... Or maybe she was never there ... Bob , that kind of thing happens to everybody . I 'm fine , David . Okay . It 's all new to me . Sure . You still don 't know anything about her ? I can draw her . I think Da Vinci was wrong . You can paint what you haven 't seen . I read about this Turkish painter who was blind all his life . He painted mounts , and lakes , and faces and butterflies , with perspective and shadow And they tested him in New York to see how the brain and other senses construct images . So maybe ... Maybe that 's what you 're doing . Maybe that 's what I 'm doing . And this is what she looks like ? Yes . She 's pretty . I wish I knew who she was . Well , now you know what she looks like . That 's good . That 's great . We should celebrate . Imipramine is not a great thing to mix with alcohol and antibiotics . Who said one of these is for you ? - Morning . - Hey , David , wanna take a look ? What is it ? - Communicable dog cancer . - She had it ! If she had not been hit by the car , she would have a cancer . What about the virus ? Rachel said she had two more minutes . That was half an hour ago . There you are . I found the canine CMV in Boomer . Right in the cancer cells . There you go ! Boomer must have infected all the other dogs , eh ? What 's that ? Cove really was running trials . Shows excellent results , for a cocktail that he uses with a toll receptor drug . Great news . The cocktail includes ribavirin , interferon and a protease inhibitor , but he does not list the details of the toll receptor drug . Don 't worry about that . I 'll get it out of him . - Five minutes in a room with me ... - David . He 's dead . - Cove is dead . - What ? Yeah . Some inmates , where he was in custody ... Mimico or somewhere ... - They heard what he 'd done and ... - Aw , fuck . In the showers ... They apparently needed his dental records to identify him . Rachel , I 'm sorry . We were so close . - You need to take some time here . - No . No , I ... We 're proving that a dog with cancer can lick you and give you some disease that dissolves your brain . It 's really just the kind of ... distraction that I need . We still have to nail transmission . How does it get from a cancer cell on your lip into your brain ? How does it enter ? Mayko ! Stay right there . I want you to go into the database on the Iron River patients and see what their physical condition was like ... I 'm looking for cuts , open sores , cold sores , chapped lips , cracked lips , that sort of thing . Got ya . How does it get from a cancer cell on your lip into your brain ? How does it enter ? Mayko ! Stay right there . I want you to ... Rachel ? You wanted to have a meeting about the canine CMV ? - Um ... yeah . - You okay ? I need to ask a favour . Sure . What 's up ? You know this decoy receptor treatment we 're thinking about for Wes ? David 's mentioned it . What do you think ? I 'm not a haematologist . What do you think ? What does Wes say ? Wes wants it . But David thinks it might be too risky . It is . It is . But if I were Wes , I would do it . Yeah , me too . I want you to show me how to administer the treatment . And I need to know how to administer the decoy treatment myself . - Rachel , listen to me ... - Will you show me how to do this ? It would take an oversight board at least 7 days to make a decision . They 'll never want to give you the OK . So what else can I do ? Yeah . Thank you . Good luck . You 're beautiful . You ready ? You sure you wanna go through with this , Wes ? ' Cause ... Yeah . Just do it . Okay . You understand the risks , right ? And you 're sure you understand how these engineered red blood cells will work . You 've explained it 3 times already , Rachel . If it works , we should see a reduction in viral load in about 4 hours . So ? Well , of the original 9 patients in Iron River , 3 had minor abrasions , 2 had chronic herpes mouth sores , - and 4 worked outside . - That works for me . Working outdoors causes cracked lips . Everybody else had open wounds . - Where are you going with this ? - Cancer cells replicate like crazy , and dogs pass them one to another . CMV is a hitchhiker . It crawls into the cancer cells and lets it do all the work for it : replication . And then the dogs transmit it from one to the other , - dog goes to lick somebody ... - Virus crawls out of the cancer cell into an open cut and enters into the body ... And then you die . So , is this a freak occurrence in Iron River ? Like , should I stop making out with dogs ? Dunno . We 'd have to find a really smart post-doc to spend the next 5 years helping us figure it out . What about the PML patients ? Antivirals can stop the infection ; the problem is , when you realize somebody 's got it , damage to the brain has already happened and can 't be undone . When all this is over , I 'm renting us a room at the Four Seasons in Papagayo , Costa Rica . Just the two of us . Common Wes ! Help ! I need somebody in here ! He 's not breathing ! Take it easy . It 's okay . I need someone now ! Take it easy . Take it easy . Just relax . Did you read this ? The girl poisoned in Ottawa ? She 's the daughter of city council Randall Oberman . He 's trying to stop the construction of a mosque . - It 's got the Muslim all over him . - He thinks they poisoned his daughter ? Some boys , Arabs , Muslim kids , have been taunting her at school and defaced her locker . If she dies ... Homeland Security commissioned 3 biotechnology companies to come up with a cure in case of a smallpox attack . Homeland wants NorBAC 's opinion on which drug to use . Is it contagious , Captain ? Should the military stop the inoculation program ? No , it 's not contagious . Not true . Marianne caught it from her husband , so technically it is contagious . A kiss ... did this ? You better look at it fast . They may have called us too late . He doesn 't have months . We 'll make him as comfortable as we can . You 're a mess . I know you 're not gonna give up on me . I don 't think he 's gonna make it . We 'll think of something .

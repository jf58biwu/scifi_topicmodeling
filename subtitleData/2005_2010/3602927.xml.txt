 You may never see the northern lights this far south again and you have your eyes closed . I 'm dreaming . There 's no need to dream . It 's all out here . - Go back to bed . - No , she 's ... You need your sleep . Think about tomorrow . Please , love . Is it two o 'clock already ? How did it get so late ? It 's not that late . We should sleep . No , stay . Kirsty ? Full halo CME observed at 2.32 . Location of flare and direction of CME indicates the solar storm is reaching dangerous levels . I 'm expecting it to peak in 18 hours . We 'll circulate warnings . Tell them to be alert for the next 36 hours . All units stand by . This is Control . We have a black van approaching . No . False alarm . He 's heading down Deansgate . - Let 's call it a night . - No . We wait . Hi . I thought I 'd lost you . I 'm not going anywhere . Maybe we could meet . Somewhere public . Amy only left ... What ? How long ? Two months ago ? You need time . No , I 'm over it . Believe me . I don 't want to be the rebound thing . You 're not ! Oh , shit ! You 're in early . No-show last night . Couldn 't sleep . I 've a favour to ask . He 's called Christian King . Dr. Christian King . Space scientist . Prometheus Innovation . Space scientist ? He wants to see a detective . Dr. King stipulated that the officer should be intelligent and one with an imagination , if that was at all possible . I 'm quoting . Please present your identification to the camera . Thank you . Please proceed . Rebecca Flint ? - DI Flint , yes . - Christian King . Do you recognise any of these images ? Where did they come from ? They were streamed live at 2.33am. - Who by ? - Do you recognise them ? No . Should I ? If the images represent one incident , the severity of that incident would suggest you 'd be aware of them . Why do you believe they 're connected ? I know they 're connected . Identical time codes . Pause that . Well , it looks as if there 's been an explosion . There 's something else you should consider . June 15 . That 's today . 20.33 . - That 's ... - That 's ten hours from now . It ... Whatever ... It hasn 't even happened ? Yet . Knowingly making a false report ... Criminal Law Act 1967 , section 5 , clause 2 . I 'm a police officer , Dr. King . My time is valuable . You know nothing about time , DI Flint . I know when it 's being wasted . Perhaps you 've been overworking , Dr. King . Let me out , please . Threatening a police officer is an extremely serious offence . I 'm not threatening you . I 'm concentrating your mind . OK , from my extensive police training , I can say that we 're looking at something that hasn 't happened yet . So , I deduce that one of your colleagues was messing around on YouTube ... This computer isn 't networked to any others in the building . There is , of course , another scenario , DI Flint . I 'm planning to blow something up and I 've decided to announce it to the world first . The number on the mobile in the image . Ring it . And then decide if I 'm wasting your time . Lauren , Harry and Kitty are unable to take your call now . Please leave a message . King 's a world-renowned scientist . Why would he issue a threat , hoax or otherwise ? Psychotic , psychopathic ? He accidentally downloaded an episode of CSI bouncing off a satellite ? No , the phone number 's real . The name , Lauren . And that 's odd , isn 't it ? Issuing a warning with all that detail . The dead girl looked pretty convincing . Run a background check on him . Straight As . Only child . No wife , no record . - Political affiliations ? - Not that I can find . He has worked with explosives before . Where ? Something called the Raven Mine Dispersal System . His contract was for two years . He left suddenly after three months . Terminated because he was too unstable ? 80 % of the work he 's doing for Prometheus is for the MOD . He must be vetted regularly . He held a police officer hostage , he threatened to detonate a bomb . - You should have just pulled him in . - Seriously , I don 't think it 's that straightforward . You weren 't in the room with him . Yes , he 's intimidating . Dangerous , even . But ... I keep asking myself , " Why tell me ? " If there is any chance Dr. King intends to blow something up in nine hours , we have to take this seriously . - I 'll talk to Counter Terrorism . - No . This is mine . I want this . Oh , God . Call the engineer . I don 't give up that easily . - I 've got a job . - I 'm heading out . It 's urgent . DC Garda ? Gada . Callum Gada , ma 'am . Rebecca . How 's it progressing ? X-ray event 's building . We 're looking at a big one . I 've warned NASA their space station crew might be absorbing their yearly dose of radiation . Are you OK ? What exactly do you want to ask me , Simon ? Security informs me a DI Flint visited you . Anything I can help you with ? Quick tips on how you ... I heard you chatting when I came in at 4.00 . How 's it going ? ... Save thousands of pounds ... So far ... But that 's it . I can 't get her to meet . It could be a total disappointment . No , no , no . She 's the one , I know it . It has a decent-sized ... Keep the noise down . I 'm working tonight . ... by a nice park . They were sent via an unauthorised transmission from our imaging satellite , Prometheus 2 . Any breach of computer security should be reported directly to myself and head of security . You know the protocols . - Christian ? - Obviously I know the protocols ! Is DI Flint returning ? I 'm expecting so . Sorry . Hey . What did the doctor say ? Her throat 's less inflamed . Just continue taking the antibiotics . Any news ? Um , I 'm ... I 'm fine . Look , please , Harry , if you lose this , what are we ... ? Oh , for Christ 's sake , Lauren ! Mum ! I have to go . I need to get Kitty to bed . Yeah . I love you . I got you a whiteboard . I know how much police officers like writing on boards . If you could e-mail me the images ... Personal equipment is not permitted . No material leaves this building without clearance . We 're on a case here . I 've transferred a copy of them to that computer . Is the work you 're doing classified ? At the moment , I 'm monitoring space weather . A magnetic storm . Why did God create economists ? To make weathermen look good . I don 't believe in God . If you need me ... my door 's always open . I thought King didn 't know you were coming back . He didn 't . Then how come he was expecting you ? It 's bloody elaborate for a coded warning . The IT system here has a default deny firewall . It someone outside has managed to breach it , wouldn 't they be stealing data , not leaving grainy pictures ? OK , assuming King 's put these images together , Photoshopped them maybe , then what 's he telling us ? How do we know he isn 't just watching us chase our tails ? King and the images , that 's all we have . We need to establish - are the images connected . If so , how ? Our two fixed points , Kirsty Harmsley . Licence . Driving licence . The dialled number 's a residential in Tedsford , Mr. Harry Phelps . His wife is Lauren . There 's a female called Lauren on the answerphone message . Are any of them flagged ? Any connection with Christian King ? Does anyone recognise that ? - Clip from a movie ? - What ? A snuff movie ? It 's hard to tell if it 's real or staged . Check for missing girls 5 to 10 . What do we recognise ? It has an abutment . Kid Wonder got a Boy Scout badge in bridges . Bridge over road carrying train lines ? That 'd explain the wiring . Koffee Kingdom 's got three branches , Salford , Wythenshawe and Dean Street . Doesn 't mean this is Manchester . Someone in a train or car . Buy a coffee , take it with you , you could land up in Glasgow . Black letters on white . A sign ? Name ? Hospital ? Something official with the letters I-N-G-H . Blood-stained rucksack with a Frisbee . Explosives not in the rucksack . - A , it isn 't blown to bits . - B , do bombers play Frisbee ? Do you ... play Frisbee ? I agree with you , DS Holt . Subtlety is greatly overvalued . No . I don 't . Black letters , white background . B road ? Bastard 's getting off on this . A B road , a bridge . Possibly a railway bridge . Is the target a train ? - Yeah ? - Hi . Kirsty . You know what you said about meeting ? OK , let 's do it . What ? - When ? - This afternoon . Oh , no . I can 't love , sorry . Not this afternoon . - Have you changed your mind ? - No , of course not . It 's just , you took me by surprise , that 's all . Well , how about 3.00 , The Triangle , in town ? OK . Great , fantastic . - You sure ? - Really . I 'll see you at 3.00 , then . Bye-bye . Storm peaking approximately 19 : 00 hours UTC . Alert ground to air and ship to shore , UK , US military , power companies . That 's amazing . " Amazing " , to stun , astonish . Yeah . It is . You suggested you may have planted a bomb . Why ? To get your attention . Why would you need my attention ? You don 't think you 're worth my interest ? Yes . No . I am . You were developing a mine disposal system with the Raven Team . Why did you leave early ? New horizons . Why don 't you believe in God ? Human tribes create gods of choice out of fear , to avoid the truth . We 're not immortal and there 's no divine plan to save us . How do you feel about mankind ? Biped belonging to the mammalian species , possibly a planetary aberration . That 's a very bleak view of life . You 're a distinguished scientist . It must be hard to admit you need help . You can talk to me . I will try to understand . Is that all you 've got ? You mouth mawkish platitudes and I confess ? Confess to what ? I 'm not threatened by you or your status , Dr. King . I am prepared to arrest you . Well , that 'll solve nothing . We both know that . In less than six hours , something cataclysmic is going to happen . You 're wasting precious time talking to me . Dr. King . Thank you . Kirsty ? Lister . This is amazing . Yeah . We actually did it . Sorry . Er , look , I 've only got a few hours . I have to work . OK . BEN : You sure , Sarah ? Take your time . I 'm sure . I 've never seen him before . I 'm sorry . OK . Well , if he does come in , would you give me a call on that number ? - OK . - Take care . Thanks . I 'll get these . Do you want a regular ? - Large . - OK . Hi . Can I get a large cappuccino and a soy latte ? Kirsty Harmsley , not in her flat . No-one knows where she is . Parents last spoke to her yesterday . I left contact numbers , photo 's on the way . Also , there 's a disc golf competition in Hazel Hill tomorrow . - " Disc golf " ? - Frisbee . How 'd you get on with King ? He looked me straight in the eye and swore in less than six hours something cataclysmic is gonna happen . Phelps 's credit rating has just come through . He has a history of financial problems . The company he ran from home six months ago went bankrupt . See what else you can pull on him . I 'll go to his home address in Tedsford . - Lauren Phelps ? - Yes . DI Flint . Is your husband in ? No . No , he isn 't . Is there a problem ? Mobile phone cloning . I 'm sure there 's nothing to worry about . We 're just being extra vigilant . Come in . - Where is Harry at the moment ? - In Manchester . Business meeting . Did you drive him ? No , he took the train . Do you know what time he 's due back ? After 9 . Who 's this man , Mrs. Phelps ? I 've no idea . Why ? Must be a colleague of your husband . Can I have Harry 's number , please ? He 's not had the job long . Don 't worry , I 'll be very discreet . Hello . That 's a pretty doll . This is our daughter , Kitty . Harry Phelps has a daughter , Kitty , roughly the same age as the girl in the image . We have a match ? It 's hard to be certain , but there are similarities . Phelps intends to maim his own daughter ? Doesn 't make any sense . Daughter Kitty is ill . No plans to leave the family home . Phelps ' wife confirmed the make of his mobile . It 's her number on the image , but apparently it 's in working order . He hasn 't changed it recently and it 's with him in Manchester . Any more on him ? He 's missed his last four mortgage payments . Bank 's applied for a possession order . See what King 's doing . Sorry . Sorry . Harry Phelps . Predicted income from the sale of liquid assets until the year end ... Storm 's been building for a few days . Takes 24 to 36 hours before it hits the Earth 's magnetic field . It 's what caused the aurora . The pretty lights in the sky . I-N-G-H . Marlingham ? It 's en route to Hazel Hill . Marlingham . You go through it to get to Hazel Hill . Did he say anything else ? No . He just went back to his work . - What 's happened ? Is it Kitty ? - Kitty ? They said you were a police officer . Is she worse ? No , no . DI Flint . I 'd just like to ask you a few questions , Mr. Phelps . - Look , I 'm in an important meeting . - It won 't take long . Do you know this man ? No . May I see your mobile , Mr. Phelps ? - Why ? - Please , sir ? Thank you . What train do you intend taking home tonight ? The 8.30 from Manchester . And what time will it arrive at your home station ? 9.11 at Tedsford . Why , what 's going on ? Integrated police , sir . Railway exercise in case of possible major incidents . Does your train go through Marlingham ? Yes . And the end destination is ... ? Hazel Hill . Look , I 'm fighting for my job in there . I haven 't got time for this . Thank you . Harry Phelps does have his mobile . I checked the IMEI number . But , Phelps is travelling tonight on a train to Tedsford . It passes through Marlingham . End destination , Hazel Hill . Everything fits except the time of his train , 20.30 from Manchester . OK , Phelps is depressed , maybe even suicidal . But he 's angry , he 's distracted . This plan requires precision . It 's ... - calculation . - Which leaves King . Arrest him , suspected terrorism . With what ? I 've no proof . Besides , how could King possibly know all this ? We can 't risk that . At 20.33 he makes a call on his mobile and detonates a bomb . I 've drawn a blank at the Koffee Kingdoms . Marlingham . Hazel Hill . Same rail route . Marlingham ? Why blow up a bridge near Marlingham ? It 's a commuter belt , no strategic value . Get out there . See if there 's a similar rail bridge in the vicinity . Take a copy of the image . We 're not supposed to remove the images in the building . Well , then , put it somewhere the guards won 't find it . Marlingham . I-N-G-H on a white background . It 's the same . Except the bit where it 's blown to pieces . Got a match for the bridge . What sort of bridge ? Road traffic under , rail over . Marlingham signpost close by . Any sign of a bomb ? Well , do you want us to check it ? With extreme care . Watch for trip wires . What ? Oh , this is insane . Hello . I 'm DI Flint , Thornborough Police . I 'm enquiring about the train from Manchester Victoria to Tedsford . Does it cross a bridge over the B204 ? OK , next question ... is there a train scheduled on that stretch of track at 20.33 ? What are we doing here ? The bomb could be on the train . It could be by the track . No bomb under the bridge , that we can see . The train Harry Phelps intends to take does pass over the bridge , albeit three quarters of an hour after the possible explosion , but but the most vital piece of information ... there is no train scheduled to be on that bridge at 20.33 . Well , that 's it , then . The bastard was winding us up . Other , more complex elements , are correct . Why get this wrong ? Something else has to be happening . Second powerful coronal mass ejection impacting the earth 's magnetic field in the next four to eight hours . We get into my car , we drive to the bridge and sit under it until 20.33 . - Legenda não traduzida - One way or another , I 'll find out what 's going on . Have you found the owner of the mobile ? Does he have the phone on him ? Yes . And have I ever met him ? I 'm surmising the answer is no . Exactly . The images don 't make any sense . The images are just images . It 's your perception of them that 's failing to make sense . If I kissed you now , would you hit me or scream ? What ? Would we end up making delirious love or would I be arrested for assault ? Circumstances change results . You know what ? I 'd begun to believe that you had a glimmer of imagination . Turns out that you 're as stupid as the rest of your profession . OK . Supposing ... just supposing circumstances change . If it 's not you then you 're talking about seeing the future . Preventing something in the future . You 're insane . Sorry . Sorry I 'm late . I 'll make it up . I 'll just get the paperwork sorted . This can 't come as a surprise to you . I know my presentation was a bit ... Look , any courses you want me to go on ... I 'll take a cut in salary . You 're used to working for yourself , Harry . And maybe if things weren 't so tight . I 'll make myself fit in , I promise . Please don 't do this . I 'm ... I 'm losing my house . I 've got a young child , for God 's ... It 's out of my hands . Please . Talk to them . I 'm sorry , Harry . - " Pas " , " nas " , " tas " . - Oh , for God 's sake . Gas , gas ! Check out HazChem warning signs . - Hey . - Hi . Thanks , I had a lovely time . Me too . I 've got your driving licence . How come ? You dropped it in the cafe . I forgot to give it to you . Oh , really ? Yeah . Actually , it was a cunning plan to get you to see me again . Well , it worked . Great . I 'll call you later . - Bye . - Bye . Oh , shit ! " Flammable gas 2 " means what ? Methane , propane , hydrogen , acetylene . What happens if the vehicle carrying it crashes ? If it mixes with oxygen it explodes . We have our explosion . Inflammable gas , probably in a tanker . A tanker ? Couldn 't go under the bridge at Marlingham , it 's too low . Also , no bloody train is due to be on the bridge at 20.33 . Trains are delayed . You cannot predict that a train will be on that bridge at 20.33 . No-one could plan this . Forget how it gets there , Callum . Assume a train is on that bridge at 20.33 . Maybe we could ring round the companies transporting chemicals . What ? Come on ! How many are there ? It 's not where it starts that 's important , it 's where it ends ! Under that bridge . Come on ! We need to think more intelligently . What the hell 's happened to you ? I might not have a degree , but I know when I 'm being had . If you two wanna hang around here and be ritually humiliated by some wacko scientist , great . - I 'm off to do some real work . - This is real work , Ben . Real , once-in-a-lifetime detection . Maybe King is a wanker , but he 's an interesting wanker . It 's always the same with you . Anyone knows something you don 't and you take it personally . Look at the picture of the dead girl . Daubed in ketchup . This is absurd . We 've proved it will be impossible to blow that bridge up at 20 bloody 33 with a train on it ! An hour . An hour is all we have left . 60 minutes until the flag shoots out saying , " Fooled you ! " at which point I will buy you a very large whisky and a packet of cheese and onion crisps . A word ? I 'm not pulling rank , Ben , but I 'll be beyond annoyed if you walk out that door . What ? Whatever may happen is happening during a geomagnetic storm . So ? Magnetic storms induce currents that knock out navigational systems . At the next junction , turn left . We 've been working on the fact that no high-sided vehicle would use that bridge . If the SatNav was on the blink ... You 'd go back to the good old-fashioned way and use your eyes . Large sign saying " Low bridge " . - What ? - Mr. Phelps , DI Flint . Are you still planning to take the 20.30 train ? On platform six is the 19.50 to Hazel Hill ... Listen . My daughter 's ill . It 's been a lousy day . I just want to go home . All right ? Phelps is going for the earlier train . That 's the , er the 7.50 . He 'll be over the bridge and off the train at Tedsford before a possible explosion . Unless something delays him . I need to see the bridge for myself . I want to be there at 20.33 . - There 's a quicker route , avoid Marlingham . - Show me . Monitor the radio , traffic diversions in the area . Welcome aboard the 19.50 to Hazel Hill , calling at Stansfield , Newton , Marlingham and Tedsford , due to arrive in Hazel Hill at 20.48 . At the next roundabout , take the third exit . I apologise for the delay . We 'll soon be moving on to Stansfield ... What ? DI Flint , Mr. Phelps . Sorry to bother you again . I 'm told that we 'll soon be allowed to move to Stansfield . Obviously you caught the train . Did I hear it was delayed ? Yes , outside Stansfield . Can you see anyone in your compartment with a Frisbee ? Yes . Why ? What about , um , a little girl ? Eight-ish . Plaits . A yellow floral dress . No . Why ? What 's going on ? It 's all part of the same safety review , Mr. Phelps . Thank you . I 'll call you again later , if I may . I know all things in this life can 't be explained . But a tanker is never going to drive under that bridge . But you do believe , we both believe , that something 's going to happen . Harry , are you moving yet ? Er , yes . I want to know what 's ... Where are you ? We 're just outside Newton . I 've seen her . The little girl . I 've just seen her . Did you hear what I said ? I 've just seen her . It ... it 's still OK . If there are no further delays , the train will be over the bridge before 20.33 . DI Flint ? What 's going on ? Are we in danger ? Sorry , ladies and gentlemen , we seem to have lost power . DI Flint , can you hear me ? Harry ? Harry , what happened ? No signal . Is the power back on ? Emergency generator . Looks like most of Manchester 's affected . What happened ? Plasma impacting the Earth 's magnetic field . It blew up substations , mobile network masts . Simon Manning . Compass direction 's changed by five degrees . Can we expect more ? Yeah . I think so . We have four minutes . This is a code red . I need a train evacuated urgently . All our communications are down . Well , find the nearest manned signal box with a landline and ring them . Now ! I 'm very sorry , ladies and gentlemen , but we are being held here due to a power failure . Any more information I get , I 'll be sure to let you know . There 's the bridge and the train . Stop ! Stop ! On behalf of the Ministry of Defence Industry Security Service , I appreciate how difficult today must have been for you . Simon 's briefed me on ... the circumstances leading up to this tragedy and how hard you worked to prevent it . - Do we have the death toll ? - 73 on the train so far . The driver of the tanker . 152 survivors . What the hell was going on ? That is an extremely good and , for the present , unanswerable question . So , in the interests of national security , and to avoid public panic , anything relating to this incident will come under the Official Secrets Act . As police officers , I appreciate I don 't need to remind you of the penalties if you contravene the Act . Kitty . Hello , sweetheart ! Oh , honey . Go to sleep . What happened out there , it couldn 't have been predicted ? Indicated , yes . Not specifically when and where ? No . But these photos did . So it 's not you . It 's not anyone on this Earth . Where did they come from ? I can 't answer that . Can 't or won 't ? Aliens ? God ? Maybe this is proof God does exist . He made the world and everything in it . If anyone knows what 's going to happen next , He should . A doctrine of predestination with " get out of jail " cards ? Then what 's your theory ? You must have a theory . You knew these events , suspected they were going to happen . You made sure I was suspicious enough to come back and then stay . To do what ? Put the jigsaw together for you ? I 'm a physicist . Proof means something different to me . What does that mean ? ! 74 people died today ! Is it going to happen again ? Until it 's established what the " it " in this context indicates , I don 't know . I saw ... We saw the future today . We saw the future burn right in front of us . I-I had a spare set of keys made before ... First time I 've used them . I 'm not sure DS Holt would want to part of the investigation team if he saw this . Then perhaps we shouldn 't show it to him . Forget physics , when have you ever heard of anyone seeing the future ? Our job isn 't to explain it , it 's to prevent it . There are no bubbles on the surface of the water . - The victim 's dead . - If we just sit here , we condemn that boy to death . Those images didn 't arrive so that you could intervene and save a life . That 's a bonus . How is Ben going to die ?

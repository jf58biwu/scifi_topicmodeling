 In 1945 , which is the end of the 2nd World War something ... which we won 't know much about , I think . Nevertheless the work that we do at Codine Computing ... is I like to think most varied and interesting . Somebody help us , please ! Hello ? I 've seen the earth , it 's in you . Not a living soul . The phone aren 't working , there 's no electricity . Nothing on the TV / Radio ... No food . Other survivors ? Is there someone left ? This house is ... empty without you . I 'm sorry . Were you far from here , when it ... ? Err , No , I was really at work . Then I went out for awhile . Kind of wander around all morning , just ... just trying to understand , really I ... What about you ? Well , I 'm studying Medicine at the University , but my place just the other side of the park . And I spent the whole day in bed . - In bed ? - Yeah . I don 't know what else to do . Until I heard the music . Yeah , the music was a stroke of genius . This is it ? This 's all the survivors within shelter ? Looks that way , pal ! - No more already ? - So far . - Keep your fucking paws off me ! Just ... - Okay . ... stay away ! No one touches me . I fucking bite ! Keep your fucking germs to yourself . Are you okay ? Okay ! - So what do you think caused all this ? - Some kind of virus . But how come it killed so many people so quickly ? I don 't know ! I watch those kids die . I 'm not going out there . I 'm bloody well not going out there today . Doesn 't have to be today . All I 'm saying 's we 've to go out there eventually . Let 's just sit here till the Army gets here . What 's the point in going out there ? What 's outside ? And what 's inside ? We got no supplies here , we gonna 've to go outside if we want to survive . We need to find out what 's happening out there . Well , for all we know we could be locked up inside here when helps just around the corner . Usually , during a national emergency , the army gets order to shoot looters . Outside ? We weren 't even out there unless the army told us to go out there . - I 'm not going out there . - Where 's your stand shaft , buddy ? You 're going to stay lock up in here fucking scare stiff , good job , bro . Don 't get smart . Don 't get fucking smart with me ! Why don 't you just relax , right ? We need to do something . We can 't just sit here and wait ... Shut your fucking cake hole ! - I don 't want to go out there , that 's all ! - Then don 't ! I don 't want to see it all again ! I want to stay here ! All we must do is get ourselves in there . Some kind of order here before we can even ... - think about trying to find any ... - Order ? Why do we need the hierarchy ? I 'm going outside for a stalk . We need to know what we 've got here . All I 'm saying we need some time . We need food , water , clothing , heating , bedding , Christ knows what else . Anyway , we don 't have any of those things in here . There are all outside . So we need to stop sitting around in here and get out there and get it . That 's not a good idea . Look , I think we 've to make our safety and security our prime concern here . - and then ... - What makes you think you 're any safer in here than you 're lying down in the middle of the Kingston Road ? Well , we don 't know what 's outside in these few blocks . But we 've to go out eventually . - Yes , but now is not the time ... - Yes , to get supplies . Okay , so it 's not ideal here , but safety in numbers . We don 't need to live in silence , wait for things to get back to normal . Normal ? What makes you think that everything 'll get back to normal ? It seems to me we can have pretty much anything , anywhere that we want at the moment ! What we really need to do is establish a secure environment , so that we can meet any eventuality that might arise . - This place is not good enough . - What about the music ? There still might be people trying to get to us . We haven 't play the music for hours . Let 's get supplies and then get safe and secure , yeah ? - That 's what we all want , isn 't it ? - Yeah ! Okay , the bottom lines is we got to look after ourselves first . Then we can slowly , then we can start looking for other people that might still be alive . Don 't we want still find other survivors now ? It 's going to be like looking for " a needle in a haystack . " Bozo still at it ? - Why do you keep mentioning that corpse stuff ? - What ? What the fuck did you do that for ? - I was just sizing , man . - Should you really ? Sure hope so . Actually it 's not a good idea to get too close to the corpses until we know what killed them . You could be crawling with deadly super migraine now . Look , Einstein , obviously I 'm immune , so no need to worry , right ? Not right ! We don 't know that 's the end of it . We don 't know if we 're immune to what 's happened . What will happen later for us ? What if it 's like an incubation period or whatever ? None of us will know if we 're gonna wake up in the morning . Maybe it just happens slower for us . Since this start does anyone heard any planes or helicopters flying overhead ? The airport 's just a couple of miles South . If any planes had been flying , we would have heard them . The train track 's are just the other side of the Kingston Road . Has anybody heard any trains ? So just how many people do you think this had affected ? This had just affected this region then logic would dictated that some help would have arrived by now . We 're not even getting anything on the radio . So what are you saying ? That this is possibly a continental disaster at the very least . The lack of any air traffics makes me think it could possibly be worse . Michael is right . This thing happened so quickly that nothing could have been done to stop it . That is true . We have no future . - Our past is meaningless . - So , what do you think we should do ? Look , I 'm just thinking about myself here , the rest of you can make up your own minds . But I 'm not prepared to sit around here surrounded by hundreds and thousands of rotting corpses . I 'm gonna leave the city . I 'm gonna find somewhere safe and secure and comfortable . And then sit around . And see what happen next . I saw it . Hey ! Hey , buddy ! - What ? - What the hell is it ? - What the hell are you doing ? - Are they alive ? Okay , let 's get one of them inside and figure out what 's going on . Christ ! - We will help you . - Too late for that . What 's happening ? Get that fucking thing out of here ! - Do you think she can hear us ? - I don 't know ! She should be able to but I don 't think she 's capable of understanding anything . She could see us too but she 's not making sense of what she sees . So how 's she moving ? Instinctively ? That 's what I think . Seems a spontaneous reaction . Does she react when you touch her ? No she doesn 't . She doesn 't react at all . She 's just turn around when she physically can 't keep moving in a certain direction . I bet she just keeps walking in a straight line if there wasn 't anything in her way . Christ ! Look at her cowered , she doesn 't really know it 's people ... that she 's looking on out there . - Did you check her pulse ? - Sort of . - What do you mean sort of ? - Well , I can 't find one . - So what are you saying ? - Nothing ! anything , I 'm telling you she doesn 't have a pulse . Get it out of here . - Okay calm . No use losing temper over this . - Let 's move her . She looks horrendous . Sorry man , you disappeared . You alright ? What do you want , man ? - Just want to get away for awhile . - All right . - You want to be alone for awhile ? - I 'm not sure . You know what would do it ? I think for me , it would be to remind of my daughter and wife . A good stiff drink . I mean getting really drunk , You know what I mean . So drunk I don 't even know me own name . - There 's a liquor store over there ! - Yeah ? Yeah , it 's just there ! - Look there . - What ? What am I looking ? - In the convenience store . - Oh , yeah , I see him ! It hasn 't got clear , has it ? Why you think he would give up ? No ! He 's standing around outside . What 's he doing ? Why don 't he go in ? - Why is he doing this ? - He weren 't alive , weren 't he ? It 's just on instinct . I just got to think what 's gonna happen when they stop walking ? All the infection and germs in them . What ? I am thinking of going away into the country . Who knows it 's gonna be completely safe ? Everywhere 's gonna be wrecked with disease sooner or later . I think going out into the country and finding somewhere safe . I mean I 'll pack up and go as soon as I can . Okay look , all I 'm saying is you guys can make your own decision . But us 3 , we 've decided that we 're gonna leave and that 's what we 're gonna do . You 're being bloody stupid , the 3 of you . You don 't know what you 're gonna find out there . You might well be right . It might be a huge mistake , we don 't know what we 're gonna find . But the thing is , it would had the whole run of the country , and logic says that we must find some way . What 's logic got to do with anything anymore ? It 's got everything to do with it ! Okay , c 'mon ... we 're gonna go ! No , I think we should put the music back on . And gather as many survivors as possible . And move out in a couple of weeks in a big group . Safety in numbers . It makes more sense to me . I 'm coming ! Okay , good ... fine ! Come ... fine ... okay ! Anyone else wants to come with us ? You 're more than welcome . Everyone that goes with you is taking unnecessary risk . Well , that 's where you 're wrong . You see , the bodies 're up and walking around . That 's all they 're doing . They won 't follow me from going to the country-side . Well , staying here all you do is guaranteed that you 'll be surrounded by 150,000 rotting and disease corpses . Guys , if the nausea doesn 't get you ... cholera or typhus or e-coli will . Don 't you see ? Everything will become contaminated ! There is no clean water . - I 'm coming with you guys . - Okay , let 's go . We 're going . Are you satisfied now ? Are you happy ? - Find a gun . - Come on . Let 's go ! You coming with us ? Let 's go ! It 's fucking too freaking me out . - Why must you be so disrespectful ? - What ? You think they noticed ? That they have feelings ? Look at them , Emma . They are dead . Just a bunch of rotting meats , that 's all . Well , it seems to me like that the earth has moved . And if I came over a chuckle , I 'll feel like laughing out . Why don 't you just take it easy ? We 're no friends around here . If they were , we 'll call on them to sit in and not you . Carl or you ? Any idea where we going ? No . We can try to look at the map . So far , I don 't see somebody outside . We got to make some decisions soon , haven 't we ? We need a plan . We got a plan . Keep driving until we find somewhere safe and then we stopped . But what 's safe ? Is anywhere safe . Well , you could argue we 're safe . Just the bodies we got to worry about . Are you 2 hungry ? Starving ! Are we there yet ? Fucking empty ! All I wanted to do was just go home and see it . I know she 's gone but ... if I see her again I just ... hug her . I wonder if I 'll see her again ? I 'm starving ! We getting out of here or what ? Over there . Look at that . - That 's perfect . - What is ? - When we crossed it . - Say what ? - All I see is a house . - That 's it . So you find a house in the middle of the woods . So ? Cause we must have passed about 1000 houses today already . What 's so special about this one ? What does the location of the house like that tell you ? Nothing ! It 's isolated , it 's very hard to get here , bright future . - Pretty much couldn 't be any better . - Yeah , it is perfect ! - What ? - It is pretty obvious . No , not to me . Quite isolated . Not that many people around here . No big contamination risks . The donkeys and geese needs to be clear out . What do you mean ? You know exactly what I mean . Put it down . - Alright ? - No . It 's all your choice , remember ? No , there are no fast and straight rules . If we 're to stay together there 're rules . Stay with you ? Why ? To become a bunch of fucking hippies farmer ? You fucking kidding me ? The world 's ours for the taking . We owned it . There 're enough groceries in the supermarket to last a lifetime . We can do whatever we want . We can live fucking gods and rock stars . We can go to the White House , go to Graceland . But no , what do you guys wanna do ? I don 't believe you guys wanna live on a farm ? Jesus Christ ! You do understand that the you 're gonna get pretty sick if you move too quickly . And the mansion , it takes quite a generator to run . Look , you 're a grown man . You made your own decision ... - either to stay with us or go . - I will , as always . Let 's go . - Good luck . - You too ! Come on , guys . Come on , forget about it . There must be something around here somewhere . Calm down , we 're gonna get there . I don 't like it . I don 't know where I am . I thought we know where we 're going ? - Got it ! - Where ? - Found in on the map . - Well done ! Now find the buildings . According to this map , we should come to a bend on the road soon . Bloody map . Bloody road . Soon there 'll be a junction , turn right , and we 'll come to the main road . We don 't want the main road , do we ? We want buildings that 's secluded and out of the way . Okay , at the junction , do we turn left or right ? Right ! - Are you positive about that , are you ? - Yeah , of course I 'm positive . Now , just bloody hell turn right . - Shit ! - What the fuck do you do that for ? Jesus , you ask me where we 're going and you turn the opposite bloody direction . What for asking ? I don 't need this ! I 'm sorry , you were fucking angry with me . You owe me that . I see it . It 's the house . Hello ? Hello ? Is anybody there ? - So ? - It 's fine . - Is there anyone in ? - Just him . Mr. Jones . Mr ... Arthur Jones . Telephone ! - Any sign of Ms. Jones ? - No . Nor for the kid 's either , I think he lived alone . Carl , what 's the matter ? - So what do you think ? - There 's plenty of rooms . You know , there 's a stream outside for water . It 's completely isolated . It must 've been a farm . There bound to be more to it than this just few buildings . You reckon ? - Yeah . - Yeah ! Wanna take a look around ? You ain 't gonna believe this , Jay . It 's a bloody generator . What ... for electricity ? No ! Is it gonna work ? Don 't know . I 'll tried to get it started tomorrow . Was it old or new ? It looks old but well maintained . Good . Let 's get it clean at sunrise . Perfect ! So Mr. Jones ... relocation time ! Wait a second . Get a shovel , you said . Why bother ? What 's the point ! To bury the bloody death , of course . Is that a problem ? - So , when 're you gonna do the rest ? - What ? Well , if you 're gonna buried him , when 're you gonna do the 300 odds million people lying around the continent ? Just tell me to get him to the other side of the field , Jay ! We 've just taken this man own home , don 't you think at least we owed him a decent burial ? I thought we 're in agreement here . Anyway , what difference does it make ? Makes a difference to him . - All Carl 's trying to do is be respectful ... - All Carl 's trying to do is waste his time doing something that doesn 't needs to be done . You be putting himself at risk . Seriously , you don 't need to do it . - I need to do it for me . - Well fine , count me out . Thanks . Thanks a bunch . Mr. Jones , come carried your weight . - Everything okay ? - Yeah , I 'm alright ! - Sorry if I scared you . - Well , don 't worry about it . - What are you looking at ? - Nothing . Is something burning ? Are we just gonna stay here , or shall we tried and think of doing something constructive today ? Yeah , you 're right . We should do something but I don 't know what . We should do something . Well , we need fresh foods for a start . Oh , my God ! It just keep adding . - We 'll just load and get out of here . - Wait ! There are more boxes here . We don 't have much time . Let 's be quick about it . Okay , let 's give away ! Ready ? What happened to them ? Where the hell did they come from ? I don 't know . It seems that they are more alive and smarter again . Yeah , their motor skills are improving too . So is their interpretation of us . It 's as though they 're still living even though their brain stopped . What day is it today ? Tuesday ? No , it isn 't . Yesterday was Tuesday , today is Wednesday . - I 'm losing track . - Yeah , I lost track . I used to hate Monday and Tuesday . And me , I just hate everyday . Well , all I can say is that now Monday feels like Friday , Friday feels alot like weekend , the weekend doesn 't seems to exist kind of thing . Well , the weekends are meaningless now cause we are not working . - So we don 't work . - Yeah , so you lose track completely . Anyway , I 'm pretty sure it 's Wednesday today . To Wednesdays ! - Cheers ! - Cheers ! Normally , if this was a normal situation what would you be doing on a Wednesday night ? Studying or drinking . Or both . - Drinking mid-week ? - Yeah ! I 'll drink any night . What about you , Carl ? As usual , of course I couldn 't drink during the week , it 's my pretty little daughter game night . - So what are you , a club or pub man ? - Pub ! - You drink with friends or ... - Sarah and me . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have said anything . It 's moving on . I wake up and it 's over and I wish I was dead . Everyday the pain 's worse than the day before . I still can 't accept that I wake up . Eventually you 'll get over it . It 'll get easier . Will it ? I 'm not sure I want it to . I don 't want closure on the family . - Well , why don 't we just called it for the night ? - Yep ! - I was trying to do the right thing ... - Mike , shut up . Snow ! This is great , if it 's snowing now , it 's gonna freeze really soon . - Maybe in a couple of weeks ... - So why is that great ? Cause the walkers are gonna freeze and stayed frozen until April or so . I got it ! I got it ! And the Lord said , let there be light and there was light . - Behold ! - Fantastic , well done man ! Thanks , man . I 'm chuffed about that . Mike , buddy . Happiness is not a progess towards no goals . I don 't know what you just say , yeah ... I am happy man , it 's only temporary but I 'm happy . What 're you doing ? I found this inside the house . Don 't know , clean it up and have a look . - What for ? - For shooting things though . - What 're we gonna used it for ? - Never really thought about it , just ... it 's be a good thing to have around . I haven 't actually finished with it yet . You ever used one of these ? No , but I 'm sure it 's can 't be that complicated . Don 't know it 'll still work if used to shoot . I don 't like it . And we don 't need it . I think we should get rid of it . No , it looks alright . Mind if I tried it out . Yeah , I do actually cause I haven 't ... No , fine . Go ahead ! - Have you shoot one of those things ? - Probably not . It looks okay , you know . Just what we need . You never knows what 's around the corner these day , do you . Just be careful that thing is old . Probably blow 's back in your face . Oh , that 's alright . I knows about these thing . It won 't blows back . Just put it down , will you ? That 's just right . Okay . Leave him , Carl . For God sake ! Why ? What 's he gonna do ? Bloody thing won 't even knows he 's being shot . You have to hit him first . He heard that . He 's still alive ! It 's coming this way ! Carl ! Carl , come back ! Let 's go ! He 's just a vegetable . Fuck ! He 's just like the rest of them . Get in ! What 's the hell going on ? Bloody hell I know ! I think they changed , haven 't they ? I saw them last night , I just didn 't think any of it . What are you talking about ? Last night when you two were asleep , I went to turn the generator off and there were 4 of them hanging around . Hanging around ? They weren 't doing anything . They were just stumbling around , honestly ! But these 4 were definitely hanging around the generator . It was like something juice them off again . What happened ? What the hell does this mean ? It 's like they 're slowly coming back to life , isn 't it ? - What ? - Think about it . They 're starting to regain their senses . Maybe they weren 't as badly damage as we thought . They are dead , they couldn 't have been anymore damage , could they ? I know ! All I 'm saying is that something inside them had survived and is slowly regaining control . It must 've happen last night . I did , last night I walked straight past them . This 's getting stupid . Look , it doesn 't matter how far fetch it sounds , the fact is it 's happening and we need to be on top of it . It 's sound ! It have to be . They heard the generator last night and the gun shot this morning . Okay , so we 've to stay quiet and stay out of sight . How we gonna do that ? Where we gonna get a silent car from ? Well , we can go for food on push bikes and camouflaged fucking dresses . Very funny , do you wanna get a group card ? Okay , I can get you one , if you want ... Guys , calm down , we have to deal with these the best we can . So , what do we do ? We 're gonna get supplies and we 're gonna lie low . How long do you plan lying low for ? A week , two weeks , a month ... a year ? I don 't know that do I , how the fuck am I supposed to know that ? Exactly ! Carl , where are you going ? Carl , come back here , we have to talk about this ! There 's nothing to talk about , what 's the point ! The point is we don 't know what 's going to happen next . Look , if this thing 's progressive , it could be 100 times worse tomorrow . We need to get out there right now , load up the van and get back in here to hid ourselves in . I don 't want to shut myself in for now . Maybe we should . Maybe we should look at this problem from a different angle . Maybe we should sealed ourselves off from the outside . - How we supposed to do that ? - Build a fence . - It need to be a fucking strong fence . - Then we built a fucking strong fence . We need to get supplies and then we 'll made a start . Look , we 're not gonna find a better place to stay than here . We need to protect what we 've got . We need to protect ourselves . Fuck you ! Holy shit , how long have you been out here ? A couple of hours , I supposed . What about the walkers ? Well , I distracted them . Listen ! I took the old boom box from the kitchen down by the track this morning and left it by the generator . You walked down the track by yourself ? - Yeah ! - You didn 't think to wake one of us up ? Well , I figured if I was quiet and I took my time , then they wouldn 't hear me . What do you think ? Good , eh ! Yeah ! Yeah ! - So , you 'll help me ? - Okay , yeah . Right , you get the other end . Ready ? Next time we 're in town , we need to think about getting another one of these . - Make sense . - I think it would be more practical . When on the road , we need to ! Light 's fading ! Better get inside soon ! It doesn 't make much difference if it 's dark or it 's light , we 're stuck here . Probably not , but I don 't like being out here where I can 't see them . - Where is Carl ? - Where do you think he is ? He is in the tower , where he 's always is now . Peering at those things with his freaking binocular again . You think he 's alright ? No , do you ? It must have been hard . I 'll go turn the generator on while there 's still light . What 's the matter ? - Emma ? - Sshh ! I think I heard something . Watch it , man ? Bloody hell ! They must have heard the generator . The sound carried by the wind . Keep the lights on and light the fire . There are so many like ... One moves , another will follow it . And they all follow that one in groups of 20 or 30 . This is so stupid . I should have turn the generator off . - What 's going on ? - Bodies , hundred of bodies . - They won 't get through , won 't they ? - I don 't know . But they don 't have the strength , have they ? They 're getting more deadly and alive everyday . Developing an animal instinct and roaming in pack . The longer this go on , the weaker they have to get . Eventually , they 'll rot completely and fall apart . I see nothing , they still appear strong . I don 't know how they can remain alive in this cold . It 's like their brain stem are still working . The stem that improved them and became more dangerous . The most dangerous of all predators . - What are you doing ? - Nothing . It don 't looks like " nothing " to me . - You want a coffee ? - No . Perfect . Got to go out for some supplies at some point in the next few days . Got to get some transport to get out of here . Do you want to take it from here ? You can go and get supplies today if you want . Yeah ! Must die for it ? You okay ? Hmm , looks nice . It was here to keep the fire burning . So , Emma asked me to talk you out of going . - Don 't waste your breath , man . - Okay . However where you be , I 'll look you up to make sure you 're alright , yeah ! That would be good . You don 't have to do this , Carl . If the bodies don 't get us , the virus will . It 's like you 'll be someone else . I don 't want to spent the time I 've left , just running and hiding . Prefer dying than living , you know . Cheer up . You know this would have been my dream home I think . But for them there , probably would have ended up living in some places like this . Me too . A bit of paint and it ... be perfect . Yeah except for the half a million rotting corpses on the other side of the fence , it really is lovely . - I am tired . - Maybe you should go to bed . It is so quiet . I won 't sleep anyway . - Ahh so , you want another drink ? - No , do you ? No , I 'm don 't really want . Then why did you ask then ? Well , I just wanted to have something to say , I supposed ! What 's wrong with saying nothing ? I can 't stand the silence . Makes me think too much . Don 't you want to think ? Not anymore . I want a break from thinking . And the silence now is real silence . Current from the power grid , low frequency for sleeping equipment . Nothing . Yeah , the silence is ... unending . You know , if we want to survive living anything like a normal life again , we have to just shut off from everything that 's outside . Yeah ! Leave me alone ! Just leave me alone ! Stay away ! This is my home ! This is my home ! Come on ! You wanna stalk me , do ya ? You wanna fucking stalk me , you cunt ! You fucking ... You fucking walker ! So it is Sunday ? - Uhmm ! - Hmm ! I was thinking we could load up some food and go for a Sunday drive . What about the walkers ? Well , we can ignore them , only doing this for awhile . Get in the Land Rover , driving , see where we end up . Okay , what 's the real reason you wanna go for a drive ? Well , the truth is we might drive around where we haven 't driven before and find somewhere more secure than this place and and find something we need . It 's true . You 're right . Thank God ! You 're the first person I 've seen in weeks . - Where were you ? - Now that I found you , Yes , I thought I was ... the only person live . That there is nobody else in the world . What is your name ? What is your name ? My name ... Your name ? Philip . Philip ... Philip Evans . Philip ... Evans . - Nice to meet you , Mr. Evans . - Thank you . - Give me your name ? - My name is Carl . - Hello , Carl . - Nice to meet you . Where do you live in ? Here . If you want we can continue this conversation inside it 's a bit expose out here . Well , come on in , Carl . Sit down . Have a sit . Here . Please . Sit down . - I 'm alright , man - I will get something to drink . I 'm sorry the place is a little bit messy and the ... Well , I was so surprised when I heard your motorcycle , I ... I thought ... Well , I 'm not sure what I thought , but ... You know , it could have been the Army ... or the police , maybe ... the National Guard . That would be good . But they 're not here anymore , are they ? They 're over in the Middle East . It would have been great or the Police ... I haven 't seen a policeman ... Somebody once told me , the err ... any situation ... no matter how dismay or how hopeless ... It can always be made worse , with the arrival of the policeman ... But right now , I love to have the policeman . It 's so strange what 's is going on . I don 't understand it at all . Where was I ? Ahh , yeah ! I knew something was definitely here . Something was wrong . - Are you sure you 're alright , mate ? - I 'm fine , I ... I just picked up a infection or something ... I ... I thought you 're gonna sit down here . Sit down ! I 'm alright , man ! I 've been on the bike for hours and I am fine standing . Are ... are you from town ? - How many of them with you ? - We 're 3 . We haven 't seen anyone else either . I 've just been sitting here waiting for someone to come ... and help me . The phone is disconnected and the power is out . What 's happened to you and up and down the country ? There are no public services because ... most of the people 're dead . No , no , no ... they 're not dead . Not right ! But they are not dead , they ... are sick . They ... they come here , when they hear me . And they ... they think I can help them , but ... I can 't ! I ... I just locked the door and ... I sit in the back and be quiet , until they go away . And they do , they ... they go away . I think you should come with me , mate . Uhm ! We are in a farm house about 3 miles from here . We got a generator that 's well equipped , I think it would be better to be with us . Well ... my mum wouldn 't want to leave , she 's ... she lived in this cottage ever since she married ... - Your mum here as well ? - Of course she is . Ask her to come . Just go get her , get everything you need , and we 'll go get us a car , right ? You 're probably right , we should ... we should always stick together . I 'll ... I 'll go tell mum . Stay here for just a second . Gotta be quiet ! This has been very upsetting for mom . My mum is having a hard time , dealing with this and I don 't want to upset her . Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! There are these ... there are these people here , who can help us . They want us to go with them . For a couple of days , go away with them . Mum ! It 's okay . Everything will be okay . I promise , everything gonna be fine . I have to tie her down . The doctor said she had to stay in bed . I had to tie her down to keep her in bed . She is sick , you know ? Philip ! Your mum 's dead . What are you talking about ? She is not dead , she 's sick . Can 't you see that ? She is dead ! Accept it . Fair enough , her 's body moving , but your mum 's long gone . Your mum not 's here anymore , yeah ? It 's just a human body outside . There 's nothing left of her . It 's just a body ! You 're deaf or something . She 's not dead , she 's sick . Dead people don 't move , do they ? And living people don 't rot . What 's going to happen to you if I leave you here ? It ain 't getting better , mate . I will not leave without my mum . Yeah , she is deteriorating as we speak . I am your last chance . I 'm your best chance . I am asking you to grab some stuff and come with me . No way , no , she is dead . She is dead weight and I ain 't carrying her . Come with me . Not without me mum ! No , I 'm not taking her , she is dead . Wait ! Accept it , she is dead . Philip ! I am doing the best for you , man ! I 'll not leave her . I 'll not leave her . - Listen to me ! - I 'm not going without her . Just listen to reason , man ! I 'm trying to save you , mate . - I will not leave her . - It 's not your mother anymore . - Yet ! Don 't you say that ! - She 's gone forever ! Your mum , your mum 's one of them . Mum ! Come on ! I 'm taking you with me . I got to go to my mum . Don 't leave us ! I 've got no idea we 're so close to the lake . I love being here , you know what I like most of all ? No idea ! It 's like being can 't stand anything that 's man-made . All there this water ! It 's like where you belong , you know . You know how it feels , leaving out all those excitements . You know , this made me feel kind of insignificant . You know what , Emma ... What 's on your mind ? Sandwich ! Shall I get going ? We need to head back . No ! No ! It 's not what I meant . I mean like sandwich ... freshly baked bread , bottom mayonnaise , a good ham , with an egg , laced with grated cheese . I want a couple of glasses of freshly squeeze orange juice , just to wash it all down ! You know what we 've back at the house , definitely some crackers and ... - Yes ! - probably some milk in the fridge . - Great ! - Not quite something fresh . - Not really , no . Will we able to eat like that one day ? - Will we ? - Of course we will . You know , thinking of the pickle and ham I don 't know if we can do that . I know . Do you think we 're doing the right thing here ? Sitting here and looking at the lake , yeah ! It 's like you said , it 's all going to be strong . It 's going to be a fucking up-hill battle . Just made me wonder , wether we 'll really be able to make anything out of what 's left . Of course , we can ! I mean the corpses are rotting now and will disappear soon ... then things will be a lot easier . What about diseases ? There are hundreds of hospitals up and down the country . We don 't know what drugs we need . Yeah , but we can find out . What if we both get sick ? How do we know if we have dysentery , - or gourd or malaria ? - We 'll read books and find out ... - Come on ... - Michael , what chance have we really got ? - We 've got every chance 's . We 've got this far , haven 't we ? I 'm sure we can get a lot further yet . You 're right . I 'm sorry ! Just get depressed sometimes . Happens to me all the time . Come on , we better get back where everybody feels safer . Go ! Go ! Go ! What 're you looking at ? Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Smash through it ! - They are in the path . - Don 't stop . We charge straight through . They hurt me , you idiots ! - Help him upstairs , upstairs ! - I am going . Okay ! Jesus Christ ! Carl ! Carl ! You okay ? What happened to you , mate ? - That 's Carl . - It is a good sign that 's he up and around as far as he 's concern . - Any change ? - No , they 're still coming . Are you serious ? I don 't think we 're gonna get out of this house . Okay , I 'm gonna go round the back and restart the generator , there 's lesser of them around there . What , hundreds instead of thousands ? Carl ! Carl , what 're you doing ? - Get ready ! There 's load of them out there , Carl ! You made your way through , alright ? - Don 't be ridiculous ! - Shut up ! I don 't want a fucking debate , alright ! You bastards ! Open the window ! Carl ! Carl didn 't want to live . His grieve was bigger than his will to survive . None of us have anything left to lose . Nothing except our lives . When a race is suddenly obsolete , life can lose significants ! But then again ...

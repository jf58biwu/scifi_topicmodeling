I went to a storage unit yesterday , mom rented out to you . Saw Nathan 's dead body . Rene told you about that . Well , it was not your brother 's body you saw it was a shape-shifter posing as your brother . It 's the worst kind of identity theft , and he had to be stopped , and then we had to store him away discreetly . You can imagine if the press had gotten wind . Matt Parkman also said that ... Matt Parkman said what ? Officer Parkman is unbalanced . Suicidal , last I heard . Because Sylar 's in his head ? Is that right ? What did you do , ma ? Is my brother really dead ? Answer him , mom .

You can talk to me . we 're family . I 'm not part of this family . - I 'm a prisoner . - No one 's a prisoner here . Samuel broke his promise . I fixed the past , but he won 't give me back Charlie . He 's a liar and an evil man . If the time traveller fixed the past , where 's Joseph ? That 's a good question . You got a minute , Hiro ? Come inside we need to talk . Tell me , what did you do When you fixed the past for Samuel ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I cannot say . Samuel might get mad , and Charlie 's at stake . I understand .

Eight weeks ago , when a man from the government Came to the carnival and murdered Joseph . - No , I don 't think I should ... - Please . I need to know the truth . Oh , no , you made us time travel . We must go back . Is that the man that killed Joseph ? No , that 's Dr. Suresh . - we need to talk . - Joseph ? I 'm behind on my chores . Forget the chores . This is not good . All right , brother , but not here . Is this it ? Is this the night that Joseph gets murdered ? I don 't know . But it is very dangerous to be here . We must go before we step on a ... Butterfly . Okay , mom , you got us here , sitting , just like you wanted . So talk . Peter , where are your manners ? Nathan , would you please say grace ? No . It 's thanksgiving , Nathan . It 's the one day we should express our gratitude . What do I have to be grateful for ? I 'm dead , he knows it . You know it . Why don 't you tell us why and put us all out of our misery ? Tell us . I don 't expect you to understand Or approve of the decision I made , but I hope you can keep an open mind and not condemn it . Sylar was gonna kill the president , and you two had flown off to stop him at that hotel in Washington . And I had a dream about you , Nathan . I saw you fighting for your life . I also saw Matt Parkman save you but I panicked , and I went and found him , and I dragged him to the hotel , but by the time we got there ... I was already dead . I made Matt Parkman do it . This is the part where I ask you to forgive me . So that body that we saw ... That was Nathan . Technically , yes . But , as far as the world is concerned , - Nathan is still alive . - Yeah , but I 'm not me . It 's your mind . They are your memories . You look exactly the same . You are Nathan Petrelli . You are my son , you 're Peter 's brother and it 's been this way for months and just because you know the truth , nothing has to change . We are still a family . To us . I would like to propose a toast To all of you for being here On this , my first thanksgiving in this apartment , My first thanksgiving I 've ever hosted . I ... and that 's especially to Lauren . Without her , we would all be eating Japanese take out right now . Cheers . Lauren . So Sandra , how did you and Doug meet ? Mmm , well ... - May I ? - Please . It was love at first sight . For Mr. Muggles and Ms. Lovegood , that is . We met at the groomer . My little angel wouldn 't stop barking Until they put her cage Right next to his , am I right , sandy ? It 's true . Nasty . Uh-uh . Dougy 's allergic . Legume-intolerant . So how did the two of you meet ? Well , Lauren and I used to work together at Primatech . And we ... we recently reconnected . Yeah , this morning , actually , frozen food aisle . I troll the place for eligible men . Primatech . Is that the paper company or that other thing ? Oh , you know about that other thing ? Yes , dear . A memory can be erased only so many times . So you worked closely then ? Well , it wasn 't like that , you know . Or am I stumbling onto something that I 'm not supposed to remember ? You 're not stumbling onto anything . I think we should all just enjoy our thanksgiving dinner . You know , in my family , on thanksgiving , we used to go around the table and everyone would say what they were thankful for . Okay , I 'll go first . I am thankful for the two beautiful women in my life ... Ms. Lovegood and my beautiful Sandy . Aww . Nice . Okay . Um , I am thankful that my daughter Claire decided to come for thanksgiving . It would not be the same without her . I 'll second that . I 'm thankful for canned yams . How about you , Claire ? Um , I know that I should be thankful , but I 'm just not feeling it right now . Is everything okay ? Her room-mate moved out . Oh , why on earth would she do that ? You 're so likeable . Doug , you don 't know anything about me . Claire . What ? You want to talk about it right now ? Fine . I 'm thinking about dropping out of school . My family ... This will surely be A thanksgiving to remember . Where 's Lydia ? Not really sure . Amanda , sweetheart , where 's your mother ? I think she went to go find the Japanese man . Did she now ? Happy thanksgiving . That man from India , he wasn 't writing a book . He wanted to talk about me . You sent me away , but I stayed , I listened , I heard everything . How long have you been lying to me , huh ? You need to calm down , brother . Then stop controlling me . Stop manipulating my emotions . Fine , you want me to let go . I will . My whole life , you 've kept me under your thumb . Why ? Because you 're dangerous , Samuel . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Oh , never mind . No , tell me what you meant . You can move the earth , Samuel . But it 's more than that . Cities . Mountains . You have the power to kill millions . I can 't let that happen . I always thought I was missing out on something , some untapped potential . Just tell me how . How can I be that powerful ? No . I 've already said too much . You think I wanted this life ? You had to be controlled from the day you were born , I gave up everything to watch over you let me free you of that burden . Show me the film let me learn what I am . Take responsibility for myself . Too late . I told Dr. Suresh to burn it . Why would you do that ? You can never know the truth . I 've made arrangements . A man from the government is coming to take you in . I gave him a compass . You 've betrayed me . My entire life , you 've betrayed me . I 'm still your brother . I love you . Joseph . No , no , no , no . Oh , Joseph . Oh , god , what have I done ? What have I done ? He 's coming . He 's coming . I know that you guys are freaking out , but I don 't think college is where I 'm supposed to be . Is this about Gretchen ? because that is one relationship . Yeah , it is about Gretchen and it 's about Becky , and it 's about everything that 's happened . Who 's Becky ? Mom , look , I just don 't think that I belong in college . And where do you think you belong , or have you even thought about it yet ? Maybe I 'll go for a year abroad . Maybe I 'll go backpack through Europe . A job . I just need to find somewhere where I fit in , Where I could be myself . And the $ 40,000 I just gave to the school , where do you think that should go ? I don 't know , dad . where 'd it come from ? This is about what that guy Samuel said , right ? Who is Samuel ? what is going on ? Maybe it is . How could you even consider listening to him ? What is happening , what did your father do ? This is not about dad . It 's about me . I can 't lie any more . I 'm a freak , and people don 't like freaks . Can I just interject something here ? No ! I think that we should all just take a deep breath . All I was gonna say is that what Claire is feeling is perfectly normal . I mean , we 've all felt like we didn 't fit in at one point or another in our lives . Heck , growing up and discovering I had a penchant for dog breeding , you think I had any friends ? Uh-uh . Trust me , Claire , this will all blow over . Really ? Is it , Doug ? Do you think that this is going to blow over ? What are you doing ? Claire ! Aw , jeez . How 's that for normal ? Great . Get more wine . - I have to tell them . - No . You can 't say anything . If someone finds out I took you to the past , I will never see Charlie again . I have something special . I 'll be right back . - Please . - I 'm sorry , Hiro but we have to stand up to him . Some things are just too important . Where you been , friend ? Oh . I got lost . Well , now you 're found . Something going on over here ? No . Something in your hair . Hmm . Well , then , you must be starved . Hiro , join me . Make yourself useful . Pass the chair , will you ? Guess he 's never seen her regen before . - So some dinner , huh ? - Par for the course especially when it comes to my ex-husband . I don 't know what 's going on between him and Claire . Well , I don 't know either , but I think that thanksgiving dinner was just his way of letting Claire know that she has a family that loves her . Nothing wrong with that . I thought you gave up all this . Yeah , so did I and then I come across this compass , Which almost gets me killed . It turns out it belongs to the strange man who shows up in my daughter 's dorm room threatening the normal life she so desperately wants . Well , maybe it 's impossible . Maybe I 'm just not supposed to have a normal life . It sounds like you 're giving up . Why did you cut yourself ? I don 't know . Maybe because you guys all think that you know what it 's like to be me , but you don 't how could you possibly ? I have to lie to everyone otherwise , they faint . I know that it has been hard , and I know that I have caused you pain , but I 'm concerned about you , Claire . These are not good people . They 're dangerous . You just have to trust me on this . Would you stop treating me like I 'm a child ? Then stop acting like one . Let me get this . Sorry I 'm late . Hey , come on in . Who 's ready for pie ? Is there a problem , mom ? Some family . You look at me , you don 't see your son . You see the man who killed your son . Don 't be silly . You don 't see your brother . Well , that 's because I 'm not your brother . Nathan . Guess again . Oh , god , Sylar 's in there with you , isn 't he ? We never should have gone to Texas , Pete . Nathan . Nathan ! Nathan . It feels good to finally be me again . What 's for dinner ? I 'm starved . You know what makes this meal truly special ? It 's knowing that each and every one of you had a hand in making it happen just as we 've had a hand in each other 's lives , in our shared destiny . Uh . Heaven . We have depended on each other for so long through good times and bad , but tonight we should be especially thankful . The future is here and it will be greater than my brother Joseph could ever have imagined . But I can 't tell you about it yet . Not while there 's a traitor in our midst . I just learned that the person who killed my brother Is here , Sitting at this table . It 's time we all knew the truth , Isn 't it ? Tell them , Samuel . You murdered Joseph . the time traveller saw it . Really ? Is that what you saw , Hiro ? I 'm sorry . I have to think about Charlie . - I didn 't see anything . - We know what you did . Why so angry , Edgar ? Is it because you 've done something shameful ? You killed Joseph , didn 't you ? You betrayed us to the government and when Joseph found out , you killed him . You lying bastard . What have you done ? I saved your life . Look . Thanks . I 'm gonna finish him . No , you can 't hurt him . He 's the only one who knows where Charlie is . He killed Joseph . I know , but this is not the time for revenge . Sometimes a hero has to run away To live to fight another day . We will defeat him . I promise you . I 'll hold you to that . Only the guilty turn tail and run . Edgar is gone , good riddance . Mmm . I feel like I haven 't eaten in months . Mmm . You think that 's some kind of existential soul thing ? You have a soul ? Come on , buddy . That 's the best you got ? No big speeches about hope ? Triumph of the human spirit ? Why don 't you let me out of this chair and find out ? And you ... You have raised the evil incarnate bar to an entirely new level . Thank you ... for giving me something to strive for . All this talk of souls and spirits sends my head spinning . I am not a religious man . But there is one thing I do believe in . Blood . Time to carve the turkey . Get away from her . What 's happening ? It 's Nathan . he 's in there . Come on , fight him , Nathan . Come on , fight him . Nathan 's dead . No , he isn 't . he 's still in you . His spirit and his mind are fighting for his family . Nathan ! Come on , Nathan ! Nathan ! Nathan . Nathan , fight him . What have you done to me ? Nathan ? - Thanks . - Oh , I 'm so sorry . It 's okay . So my dad called you ? Yeah , well , he said you were feeling low , and he knew I was feeling low , so ... How 's your new room-mate ? Fine . Dull . Actually , it 's awful . No one 's tried to kill me for days now and she 's a slob . Well , you know , the other side of the room is still available . Sorry. you 're right . I don 't know why you would ever want to move in with me again . Maybe because of all the people that I 've met in college so far , you 're the only one who 's ever made any sense to me . Now see , I told you you were gonna have fun . What do you think about Christmas ? How about a movie ? Much better . Should I give you my number , or were you just planning on stalking me in the produce aisle ? Uh , canned goods I think it was . My home number is on the back . Use it . - Happy thanksgiving . - You too . Good night , ladies . nice meeting you . Bye . We 're leaving , Claire . Happy thanksgiving . Bye . Sorry about Doug . He 's fine . I told him he ate a peanut . He 's not the sharpest tack , but he 's a good man . Never a dull moment , Noah . Not if I can help it . - Thank you . - Bye . Bye-bye . I 'm gonna go wait in the car . Thanks for the invite , Mr. Bennet . Any time . I guess " I 'm sorry " doesn 't begin to cover it ? No , it 's not your fault . I 'm just ... I know , I know . you 've got a lot to figure out . I just want you to take your time and really think About your choices , Claire , because you do have choices . You 're absolutely right . So you 're going back to school ? Yeah , classes start Monday , and I will be there . That 's great news . - Mmm . Love you . - Love you . And thank you for inviting Gretchen . I wasn 't over-reaching ? No , it was actually the perfect dad thing to do . Next thanksgiving , your place . It 's a date . Hey . ready to head back ? Actually , no . We have a couple days off before classes start , and I want to find out where this leads . Where 'd you get that ? I stole it from my dad . He said I had choices . And I want to know what they are and this is going to lead me to ' em . A compass ? - Okay . - You up for an adventure ? It 's okay if you 're not . I understand . I mean ... We might run into Becky there . Oh , yeah , she 's not one of my favourite people but you are . So which way ? Take a right . You saved Edgar . How honourable . Of course , when you betray me , You put Charlie in danger . Your brother was right . You are powerful but I am powerful too . I 'll make it so you never see her again . You won 't do that . You still need me . So you tell me exactly when and where Charlie is , or I am leaving . And you will be the one who is lost . I like this . Little man standing up for himself . But you don 't actually think I 'd ever let you leave , do you ? You don 't have a choice . I always have a choice . How do you feel , Hiro ? What have you done ? I 'm gonna find him , and I 'm gonna bring him back , mom . It 's over . It isn 't possible any more . The one thing I know , the one thing I can count on since all this started , is that anything is possible . It 's Sylar . Nobody wants him dead more than me . You want to know what I want even more ? My brother alive . I 'll find a way . Edited by Scooby

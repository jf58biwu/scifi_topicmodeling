 Previously on Heroes ... Give me one good reason why I shouldn 't tear open your head right here . Because you 'll never find your dad . We need to show progress . These are our targets . Hunt them , track them , and bring them home alive . If you kill me , I 'll get exactly what I want . And what is that ? They 'll see what I 've been telling them . They 'll know just how dangerous you people are . Daphne 's alive , Matt . They have her , alive . You 're lying to me ! - No , no , no , no , no . I won 't fight you . Your mother wants me to move out of the house for a while . She 's right . We keep too many secrets in this family . They 're just locking people up ? Believe it , it 's happening . Somebody sent me to warn you . You must be on a list or something . I can breathe under water . You 're ok , we need to get out of here immediatley . We 're out of whole wheat . Sorry . Whatever . I 'm starving . Well , my mom 's going to the market soon , so hopefully she 'll take Lyle . You can come downstairs , stretch your legs a bit . Well , that 's a good thing . I 'm starting to stink . Look I 've got the cash . There 's a train leaving for Albuquerque tonight . Albuquerque ? I don 't know anyone in Albuquerque . Well , that 's the point . You could start over , become a new person ... Where no one could find you . Yeah , but I never agreed to that . My family 's here , my friends . My life . Do you want them to find you ? Make you disappear forever ? They 're gonna find me anyways . The government has those spy satellites . They 're probably watching us right now . No . No , we 're fine . Yeah , but you don 't know that . You 're not Harriet Tubman , Claire , all right ? And this isn 't the underground railroad . You 're just a high school girl , and you 're in way over your head . Well , if it wasn 't for this high school girl , you might already be dead . So you want to survive , you 're gonna have to do exactly what I tell you- - got it ? Claire ? I need to speak with you . Claire ... Hey , mom . What 's up ? Our house money 's gone . You know , the money I keep in Mr. Muggle 's rubber sneaker . Any idea where that went ? Maybe Lyle took it . I already grilled him . Per usual , he has no clue . Okay , fine , I took it . I was was gonna pay you back . Claire , I don 't get it . You have a nice allowance . What do you need $ 300 for ? Are you in some kind of trouble ? No , I just ... What is it , Muggles ? What 's under the bed , boy ? What is it ? What is going on with you , Claire ? Nothing . Nothing , I swear . I didn 't hear anything . Miss Bennet , right ? Hi . Home sweet home . Not anymore . Got a one-bedroom in Dupont Circle . You don 't mind that we 're keeping an eye on your daughter , making sure she 's behaving herself ? Claire 's a big girl . She makes her own decisions . If she does something wrong , she can live with the consequences . Ladies and gentlemen , your attention , please . Peter Petrelli has joined Matt Parkman as priority one . Charged with kidnapping , assault , and attempted murder of federal officers . Both of these men are considered armed and dangerous , and should be taken down by any means necessary . Short of lethal force . Actually , Senator , my men have been given the go ahead- - shoot to kill . On whose authority , Danko ? Mine . Back to work . Do you really want to push my hand ? Your brother came into my house , put a gun to my head . I saved your life , if I remember . You made this personal . Now I do what I need to do . Keep an eye on him for me , will you ? Matt and Peter kidnapped me and threatened my life . What makes you think I won 't shoot them myself ? Sir , we have a lead . Manhattan . Matt . Uhh ! - Matt ! Matt . - Uhh . Matt , you need to stop . Matt ... Matt , you need to stop ! Stop . Stop . What happened ? Look , you 've been painting the same image over and over again all night , okay . I 'm guessing you 're trying to find some answers how to stop this . Oh , God . Look , we need to leave , okay ? It 's too dangerous here . We gotta go now . No ! The only thing that matters right now is finding Daphne and getting her back . One life at a time . Okay . Look , Matt , when you were in Bennet 's head , could you see--could you tell where Daphne was ? Anything ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I mean I didn 't see much . I saw a hallway . Okay . Did you turn that on ? No . Who the hell is Rebel ? I have no idea . Address ... Daphne ! Someone 's listening to our conversation . No , no , no . He 's just hacking in . This could be information . We need this information ! We don 't know who this is . How can we trust this person , huh ? What if this is a setup ? And what if he 's telling the truth ? Go ! Go , go , go ! They 're gone . We just missed ' em . I think I know where they 're headed . Mom , this is Alex . He 's , uh ... He 's my new boyfriend . Okay , that doesn 't explain why he 's hiding in your closet . Right . Well ... we 're ... You 're really gonna make me say it out loud ? Absolutely . We 're having sex . And I know it 's wrong . Very , very wrong . You do understand that my daughter is only 17 . I haven 't touched her . Okay ? I barely even make eye contact . Claire ... The truth . He 's like me . He has an ability . You can tell her . I can breathe underwater . He has a power ? And you brought him here ? ! Dad was after him . I didn 't know what else to do . Do you have any idea how dangerous this is ? Yes , I do , but what was I supposed to do , just let him- - And on top of that you lied to me ! I am so disappointed . The agent still there ? Pretty sure you lost him when you skidded off onto the dirt road . But just to be sure ... yep , we 're clear , officially , off the grid . No communications within 50 Miles . You sound disappointed . Maybe I am . I mean , the way I see it , agents catch up with us , we just pwwsshhh- - charbroil ' em from the inside out . I don 't want to leave the trail of dead bodies directly to my father 's house . Why are you doing this ? Parents suck . You never get what you want from them . When I was a kid , I just wanted my dad to take me fishing . He used my arm as an ashtray instead . Seriously , look . I have the scars to prove it . Oh--oh ... You should have worn a seat belt . Dude , you 're hurting me . Why don 't you want me to see my father ? I just- - I don 't get it . You don 't need to get anything . My father 's the only one with answers . You 're the most powerful dude on the planet . I mean , what could you possibly need ? We don 't need anyone . - What ? Hey , what are you doing ? What the hell ? ! If you 're hungry , there 's a burger place up the road . Whoa ! Hey ! I 'm sorry I lied to you . I should have told you about Alex . What you 're doing is extremely dangerous , Claire . Do you understand that ? They were gonna lock him up for no reason . And they 'll do the same thing to you . This is not a game . Mom , I have to do this . I know that it 's hard for you . You want a normal life , a regular family . But that 's why Dad and I have to lie . So we can protect you . Why ? ! Because I 'm some fragile creature in need of protection ? No , that 's not what I meant . I know what you meant , and I 've got news for you . I 'm strong . Much stronger than either you or your father think . And I know more than you think I know . For example , I know that right now , there 's a van parked outside on the street . They 're watching us . They 're watching you . You think she 's hiding the Woolsley kid ? Absolutely . I 'm telling you she 's helping him . Those pool cleaners have been parked out there for four hours . Nobody 's pool is that dirty . This is bad . How you gonna save Alex , Claire ? You can 't go out there . You gonna keep him up in your closet forever ? No . No , I 'll come up with something . I have a plan . I just haven 't thought of it yet . I have an idea . You do ? Yeah . And you can either keep me in the dark , and lie to protect me , or you can let me help . I say we definitely let her help . All right , Mom ... what 's the plan ? We 're not gonna have a lot of time . Get in there , you do your mind-control magic , and then we get Daphne and we 're out . It 's impossible . I mean , look at this building . It 's gotta be jam packed full of people . There are only so many minds I can control at any given time . You 're right . You 're right . What are you doing ? What is that ? I just borrowed your power . Great ! That way we can watch each other 's backs . And you can 't fly now . Which basically rules out our rooftop escape plan . See , we gotta get into the building first . And two guys pushing thoughts is better than one . Come on . Top floor . I love doing that . Right ? Makes it a lot easier . They got cameras everywhere . Let 's go . In here . Come on . Hey , you 're not allowed in here . You 're gonna finish your lunch in the hall and make sure no one comes in . I 'll just finish my lunch in the hall . The plan was to find Daphne . Gotta know where to look , huh ? Sir , take a look at this . Okay , this is a problem . How the hell did they get in here ? Targets are in Operations . Shut down the computer systems , everything . Can 't . Someone 's hacking in . Damn it , just shut it down ! Let 's go ! Wait . Hell with that . I wouldn 't go out there if I were you . You 're not me . Son of a bitch . What ? How 'd you do on your history exam ? C-minus . Right . You 're grounded . Drivers license , please . Now . Thank you . That was harsh . He 's a terrible driver anyway . To disappear , you need a new identity . Trick is to remove the photo without tearing it . There . I cannot believe you know how to make a fake I.D. Where did you learn that ? Dad ? - No . Claire , believe it or not , I was a teenager once . And an enterprising one , not unlike you , young lady . Oh , there was this band once I just had to see . Def Leopard . Oh , my God , Rick Savage . Bass player . So cute ! Oh , what I would have given to- - Mom ! - Sorry . Alex , you need to change your looks . probably using facial recognition algorithms . That I learned from your father . You can find a change of clothes upstairs . I appreciate everything that you 're doing . Wow . You know I didn 't mean to drag you into all of this . You were gonna do it one way or another , Claire . Just thought I might help . I 'm sorry for being the way I am . Making everything so much harder . Sometimes I just wish I was normal . Why on earth would you want that ? It would just make everything easier . Maybe you and Dad would still be together . Honey , your father and I had issues long before you came around . Why 'd you marry him ? 'Cause I fell in love with him , warts and all . He was dangerous , handsome . I accepted everything that went with that . But now ... I 'm tired of being lied to . I can 't see my marriage anymore . So it 's ... over . You guys are gonna get a divorce . I don 't know . Maybe . But whatever happens between your father and I has nothing to do with you . Okay ? So what are we looking for ? Something happened here . Yeah , like a million years ago . I 've been here before . How do you know ? I remember . My father was here too . # listen to the wind blow # # watch the sun rise # # run in the shadows # # damn your love , damn your lies # # and if you don 't love me now # # you will never love me again # # I can still hear you saying # # you would never break the chain # # and if you don 't love me now # # you will never love me again # Hello ? Where did you just go ? I can remember my father . Are you sure ? Positive . Sorry . - It 's okay . I still don 't know why you 're doing all this for me . Well , we 're an endangered species . I 'm just ... doing my best to try to save us . Hell , I didn 't even know there were others like me . I remember that feeling . So ... how do I look ? Like an exceptionally cute boy who can breathe underwater . You 're special , Claire . And not just because of the whole immortal healing thing . I don 't know . Maybe if things were different , we could have gone out or something . We could have been hiding in your bedroom for entirely different reasons . Uh , even if things were different , I 'm not really into the whole relationship thing right now . Hmm . It just seems like everyone who gets married gets a divorce . Okay , I think it 's more like half of all marriages get a divorce or something . Yeah , but who knows how happy that other half is . I don 't know . I still think it 's worth it . Why ? For moments like this . When someone gets you the way that no one else does . It 's definitely worth it . Those agents are coming toward the house . Alex , come with me . Come with me ! Go . Come on , in here . That 's the first place they 're gonna look . No , you have to whack it . Watch . Now get down here and push it with your foot . Your dad used to store guns , files , god knows what else in there . He doesn 't think I know about it--careful . That 's right , now close it . Close it behind you . Okay . Just another day in the Bennet house . Let 's go . Let 's go ! That is so weird . You 're not supposed to be here . I 'm off limits . Top floor is clear . I told you , you 're wasting your time . Oh , come on , Claire , we both know what 's going on . Hot guy , just your type . Where is he ? He 's here . I know it . Well , that would be wrong , wouldn 't it ? If you two are finished here , I need you to get the hell out of my house . Wow , that was close . I cannot believe the way you stood up to that bitch . Let 's not celebrate yet . They 're not gonna give up so easily . The train 's leaving soon . We need to find a way to get you to the station . You have both done enough . Maybe I can slip out back . Make a run for it . No , they 'll catch you . Maybe not . We 're gonna give him a head start . I think I got something . Daphne ? Millbrook , right ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . She 's not here anymore , Matt . transferred to a medical facility . Damn it . Of course . wait , hold on a second . Look . Your friend is back . Rebel ? Tell him he screwed us . Daphne 's gone . He 's opening up a file . I think there 's something he wants us to see . - What is it ? Come here . - That 's us . Huh . That 's us- - that 's the entire operation . They got the whole thing on tape . What are you doing ? - Copying the files . What for ? - To expose them . Look , American citizens rounded up like this . No warrants , no trials . This is gonna look great on the evening news . Nathan 's not gonna know what hit him . We 'll use this as leverage . Daphne 's not here , Matt . There 's no guarantee that we 're gonna find her , but if we have this- - we can make a deal . Everything we 've got in exchange for Daphne . One life at a time . Parkman 's a telepath . Incredibly powerful . But when he uses his ability , his senses become raw nerves , and he becomes susceptible . We exploit that ... we can disrupt his thoughts . That just might work . Let 's do it . Unh ! Peter , I can 't focus . We gotta get outta here . I need more time ! It 's done ! I got it ! Matt ! - What ? 30 seconds for what ? It 's off . Come on , let 's go ! Go ! Whoa , whoa , wait . You do not want to shoot us . Hey , wait . Down . Down . Good , good , good . Don 't do it ! This is only gonna end badly . Don 't do this . I 'll hold ' em , you go . - No , what about you ? There 's no time . Go . Go . I 'll hold ' em . Bennet , you know me . Nice and easy . Something terrible happened here . What are you talking about ? It 's a toy car . What 's the big deal ? No ... My father did something to me . Something I forgot . Well , that 's a good thing , right ? Not remembering all the crap that happens to you when you 're a kid . No . It eats away at your soul . # chain , keep us together # # running in the shadows # # chain , keep us together # # running in the shadows # # chain , keep us together # Mommy . Mommy . So you didn 't find Peter ? You 're not helping him , are you ? Don 't be ridiculous . Someone 's out there calling themself " Rebel . " Knows we 're building 26s . How it runs . So I see . You have all that information too . Tell me this isn 't you . Of course not . First of all , I don 't know the first thing about computers . Yeah , but you could hire someone for that , Mom . And beyond that , I know who 's keeping me safe , Nathan . I can live my life in peace , thanks to your generosity . I would never betray you . Look , Peter ... he stole a dangerous file . And there are people that want him dead because of that . You 're in charge . You can protect him . I 'm doing everything I can to contain and control these people with abilities , but there are other people that want to see them all dead . Yes , dear . I 've had a bit of experience with all this . Hello ? It 's me . Pete , where are you ? - Is he okay ? I 'm only gonna say this once . You know what I took . I 've got evidence against you and your entire organization . What you 've been doing to us . What do you want ? A trade . Matt Parkman and Daphne Millbrook for everything that I 've got . That 's it ? Two people ? I don 't understand . Look , if anything happens to them or me , all the information I 've got goes directly to the nightly news- - do you want that ? So do we have a deal ? Fine . Where do you want to meet ? Hey . My son and I are going to a movie . Does that threaten the Federal Government ? Unh ! Uhh ! - You okay ? Yeah . Fine . You can get off of me now . Oh , God . We gotta go . That way . End of the block . Think I see ' em . We all set ? - Town car 's ready . Ten minutes to the exchange . Your boys know where they 're headed , right ? It 's exactly where your brother wants . 4001 North Nebraska Avenue . - Next to the network news . I don 't suppose that 's a coincidence . Peter 's no dummy . Daphne and Matt ready for transport ? No , Senator , they 're not . We 're not making a deal . What 's he talking about ? What the hell are you talking about ? I have another plan . You realize if my brother 's harmed in any way , copies of those files are gonna make their way to every news organization in this country . Our entire operation will be compromised . I 'm aware of the situation . Then get Millbrook and Parkman released right now , put them in the car , and get them down to the parking lot . Or do you want to disobey a direct order ? I 'm following orders , Senator , just not yours . The United States Government will not make deals with terrorists . Those were the President 's exact words . Despite your endless protestations , your brother 's a terrorist . Terrorist ? My brother 's not a terrorist . Target spotted approaching parking lot . I 'm en route . Hold your stations . Just stay out of my way . Let 's go . Noah , just remember , Peter can hear your thoughts . Where are they , Bennet ? Peter ... Matt , Daphne . Listen to me . are you in there ? Come with me . Matt ? And nobody has to get hurt . Peter ... listen to me ! They 're not here . You 're being set up . Time to die , Petrelli . Just a little further . Gimme the kill shot . I 'm trying to save your life . Get out of here , he 's gonna- - Are you all right ? It 's just a scratch . He 'll be fine . What do you want , a thank you ? Why ... are you doing this , Nathan ? Doing what , saving your life or trying to save the world ? Perhaps there 's a better way of doing it . Ma- - - This hasn 't turned out exactly the way I wanted it to . Okay ? - I 'm aware of that . There 's a lot of different agendas going on . Yeah , all leading to killing us . You realize you 're responsible for that . Yeah , I do . It 's out of control , and it 's my fault . But I can fix it . In fact , I 'm the only one who can fix it . Why is that ? - Because you 're one of us ? ! Because I 'm the only one who really cares if you 're alive or not , Pete . Come with me , okay , and I promise you 'll be treated well . Don 't do this , Nathan . - It 's okay . Ma , please . You have my word . I know you 'll take care of me . - I will . Because you love me . Pete , I 'm just trying to help . Yeah . Bye , Nathan . Pete ! No , Nathan , don 't . You give me one good reason why I shouldn 't go after him right now . Because the game has changed . I 've seen it , and you need to be ready . And we have some breaking news for you now . Rumors have surfaced that the U.S. Government has recently broadened the reach of the Patriot Act . Thanks , Brian . Well , tonight sources have provided our news bureau some startling footage taken directly from an unnamed government agency right here in Washington . Now , this video shows American citizens in hoods and restraints in what appears to be a clear violation of their constitutional rights . Is the government running a secret military organization with the authority to disregard civil liberty ? So what , we 're just gonna stay here all day ? Look , the guy 's an ass , plain and simple . All right , I told you parents su- - He killed my mother . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know . I mean , I 've been trying to tell you that he 's a jerk . You 've been trying to tell me , really ? When did that happen ? 'Cause all I can remember is the cute little stories of you two bird watching around the neighborhood . You made him sound like Mr. freakin ' Rogers . I was just waiting for the right time . Unh ! Hey , I got an idea . Why don 't we drive up to Canada , because we 're close to the border . We could rob some old ladies . - That 's not gonna happen . Why are you doing this to me ? Because you 're here , and I need to express my feelings . You used me for some joy ride , an escape . I got news for you , kid . There is no escape . There is only pain . And you can never outrun it no matter what you do , no matter where you go . Go home to your mother , Luke . You 're not gonna kill me ? Seems a little on the nose . Where you going ? To find my father . 'Cause now that I 've seen the truth ... I want him to die . What the hell are you doing ? Must 've realized there 'd be consequences for your actions . Yeah , when that story breaks , you 're exposed . and the world will see what you 're doing . You 're hunting innocent people . You 're not innocent . The world just doesn 't realize how dangerous you are . Now they will , and they 'll beg me to hunt you down and kill you . The enemy has a face , Parkman . It 's you . No , I don 't want to hurt anyone . Really ? To me ... you look exactly like a terrorist . Why did you ... You gonna miss having a cute guy in your closet ? A little . You were incredible . Nice to know I still have a few tricks up my sleeve . I love you . I love you . Just the way you are . I wouldn 't trade this life for anything . Me either . So I made popcorn . Figure we could watch a movie . Some sappy love story . Ah , sounds perfect . I 'll be right down . Hey , Barbie . You ! I got a message from someone named Rebel . I need your help , Barbie . up.by.

One day at a time . 35 years . Needle mark . Csu found a bindle of - straight flush , killer dope . I want a full tox screen . I 'd have the needle residue tested , too . If CSU had found one . Next of kin ? Next stop , Potter 's Field . My hands are still buzzing . Cocktail time . Expensive test . The new sarge isn 't gonna like it . Put it on a rush . Priority request . Oh , come on , man . I 'm parched . It 's not workin ' out for you , the drinking ? You sound like Ollie . Call me if you want to stop . All right . What 's this about ? Ollie played guitar right-handed . Right-handed junkies shoot dope in their left arms , usually . Sherlock marquez . And if he OD 'ed , where 's the needle ? What 's this about for you ? I know how you feel . I blacked out once , woke up in Cuba . They think you 're crazy . Crazy stories ... Chasin ' down John Wilkes Booth , throwin ' the high hard one to Emily Dickinson ... How you doin ' ? I 'm ok ... If you 're not here to kill me . You 've been in a lock-down psych ward for two days . What ? No visitors , not even the kid that signed you in , the horn player . You 're ' ok ' ? Who are you ? I 'm an alcoholic . Same as you . Maybe we can help each other . Oh , my . The name is Frank . Give me a call when you want to stop . Omar signed me in ? Keep the change . New York city takes care of its own . And that is what big apple shelters are gonna do . As a city councilman , my job is to solve problems any way I can . Now , when I told my wife Daphne that the project had run out of money , Daphne persuaded the great Chris Duncan to perform a benefit for us , and today , the first big apple is open . Daphne ? Thanks , Ben . I know some of you are skeptical . You know what shelters in this city are like . If you 're lucky enough to get a bed , odds are you 'll also get robbed . Or killed . Big apple isn 't just about beds . It 's about education , rehab , job training . There . Getting out of the shelters , back into life . So , if you need a little help , big apple is finally here . Hey , this is our spot ! Get out ! Cool out . Ok ? Did Ollie have a hiding spot where he kept his stuff ? You 're out flying ' the flag , you gotta have a good spot . Hey . I 'm Daphne Tucker . You need a place to stay tonight ? No ! I live here ! Don 't yell at her . Hey , man . The tuckers are for real . They gave me a job driving them and my own place . I need a drink ... Now . If they don 't want help , nothing you can do . Show me the hiding spot . This is about the overdose . You know anything about that ? In the last two years , there have been seven drug-related deaths in this park . The problem is not going to fix itself . If we don 't do something to help these people , who will ? Oliver Hardin . This is just a list of his AA meetings . That 's it . Look at this . What ? Don 't tell me you know what weirdass lock this fits . Babe Ruth 's secret hot dog locker ? You ordered a tox screen on the homeless OD ? It didn 't add up , sarge . The vic was right-handed . Ok , good , at least you had some clues . Here I was thinkin ' your partner 's was a drunk , just wanted to believe this guy was sober . Methadone . Fatal dose , five times over . Killer dope was a set-up . M.E. ruled it a homicide . Next time , just run it by me . I like her . Why ? Because she just backed up her partner ? Oh , no , wait , that was me . Hamilton Arms . Flophouse hotel on Barrow , public lockers . I 'm like 90 % sure . Where are you going ? Who 's that ? He 's nobody . Howard , alcoholic . Hi , Howard . It 's supposed to be anonymous . I 'm supposed to feel safe in these rooms . I see photographers outside my meeting , I don 't feel safe . Takin ' pictures of celebrities leaving my meeting ... I feel like havin ' a bottle of vodka , a fistful of percs , and punching ' someone 's lights out . Pictures don 't matter . Sobriety , that 's what counts . Sorry . Who are you ? Chris , alcoholic , addict . Hi , Chris . The real Chris . Who I am out in the world , that 's the other Chris . Chris Duncan , the rock star . See , he 's the famous one . Everywhere he goes , they take his picture . Problem is , the real Chris needs to be here . If I don 't go to meetings , I shoot dope . I 'm dead . Pictures don 't matter . Bein ' honest is all that matters . You get a notebook , pencil , you write down all your secrets . Writes a moral inventory of your whole life . However long that takes . You write your worst secret at the top of the list , the one thing you swore you 'd take to the grave . And then you keep going . If you 're fearless , you 're thorough , you tell the absolute truth . You get clean . I 'm John , I 'm an alcoholic . Hi , John . I wanna be honest in here , because that 's what I was taught . A guy named Ollie used to come here . If you knew him , I 'd like to talk after the meeting . - I 'm investigating his death . - A cop ? Working a meeting ? I earned this seat . That went well . Only thing in Ollie 's locker . Oh , boy . Big deal . Old guy had an old guitar . Old ain 't bad , with guitars or men . A gibson I double o , early 1930s . Mr. Robert Johnson 's axe of choice . Good shape . You could get six , eight grand for it . That 's why a homeless guy had it . Who 's Robert Johnson ? Who 's Mozart ? Who 's Charlie Parker ? Who 's Chano Pozo ? Cuban percussionist . Used to play big band bebop with Diz . Co-wrote ' Manteca ' . Ouch . Robert Johnson invented the blues . Sold his soul to the devil to do it . For what , immortality ? Who wants that ? Played this thing like no one ever has , before or since . You dig chano , my man RJ will melt your brain . 6,000 ? He 's on crack . You 're right . The guitar isn 't worth what Omar said . Not this one . Print that out . This one might 've been Robert Johnson 's . It 's worth a little more . 320,000 and it gets better . Purchased at auction by Chris Duncan . Small world . Chris raised money for the big apple shelter . How did Ollie get it ? The shelter benefit was Chris 's last gig . He cancels everything ... Big tour , new record , checks himself into new horizons next day . Doesn 't tell a soul . How 'd you know ? Lucky guess . Look who 's here . Mr. ' I don 't feel safe ' . The cop ? The cop . This your cop friend ? Who 's today 's target ? Chris Duncan ? There he is ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , stop ! Need to see Chris Duncan . Chris ? Decoy . There he is ! Sara , I 'd like you to meet ... Omar . A real pleasure . Wow . Not a lot of men can pull that off . He doesn 't deserve you . So , we 're on a date . I need some date stuff . What about your family ? Tell me about your family . Not much to tell . You know about mine . The Dillanes , of greenwich , newport and New York city . Biggest private house on Park Avenue . My great grandmother . She thought bigger was better . So did the old man 's mistress . The ballet dancer . Made him hire Stanford White . Family secret ? I thought so . No such thing . So , what about the Amsterdams ? My father ... I left home when I was 14 . I thought he 'd fight me on it . He didn 't . He still around ? Long time gone . My mother , too . What did he do ? The best he could . John , I need details . I 've gotta get you drunk , loosen your tongue . Omar ! I don 't drink . Oh . Bet that 's a good story . Good night , guys . Good night , Omar . Young white man with a colored child ? No day at the beach . You struggle through god knows what growing him up . Don 't give up now . You want your son back , start writing , do the work . My whole life . Might take a while . You like it ? Your son walking ' past you like you don 't exist . What happens when I 'm done ? You read it . Out loud . To another human being . Like me , for example . The past is the past . Everybody 's got one . You 're not gonna tell me anything I haven 't heard before . Hey , Frank . You got more of these ? I have told you , I have no idea where Chris is . You took pictures at the benefit . You know what he looks like . Backstage pictures . Revealing , personal . No . I sell those , mate . Not with an expired work visa . Mate . Fine . Chris was so high he needed a stepladder to scratch his ass . There . Looks cropped . Hang on . It 's Ollie . They invited all the guys from the park . Free food . You need to take a picture of Chris Duncan , right now , where do you go ? The man likes a high thread count . Five star hotels . Good luck . Does he register under fake names ? That 's why I say ' good luck . ' What names ? Bye-bye now . Immigration , you got them on speed dial , right ? 'Jim Hendrix . ' ' Bud Holly . ' His dead heroes . I thought Chris Duncan was in rehab . You don 't think he has something to do with the park overdose . He 's a person of interest . He just strolls out of new horizons . He 's out now . We thought you might know where he is . No . You were on his list of approved visitors . Which he made up when he got there . In withdrawal , out of his mind . Intake office . Already more requests than beds . If there 's nothing else ... Well , actually , if you wouldn 't mind telling me - Thanks for your help , mrs . Tucker . Ah , Daphne . The missing wife . Detectives Amsterdam and Marquez . My husband , councilman Ben Tucker . I never see her anymore . One of the park guys , they 're investigating his death . The overdose . Oliver Hardin . Guys like that , that 's why she 's doing this . When you 've fallen that far down , no resources , no hope ... Right out front , sir . Great parking space . Good job , Bob . If there 's anything I can do . Thanks for your help . She didn 't visit Chris , but she knows he was at new horizons ? Not worth pursuing ? Oh , no . I picked up her cell by accident . Easy mistake . They look so much alike . Three calls from the Kempler hotel . Swank place . You gonna get a warrant for every room ? Jim Morrison , please . Nope . I 'm sorry . I meant Johnson . Mr. Robert Johnson . Yes , Bob Johnson . Ohh . Thank you . Bob 's not taking calls at the moment . Oh . Hey , brother . This belongs to someone inside . Thanks . You forgot the key , baby . Nag , nag , nag . Chris ? Eva ? Just like Ollie . Not quite . This one 's rich , white , and famous . His driver 's license , cut in half . What 's this ? Planning a party ? A list of names . I never saw nor contacted my parents again . I heard later they had believed I had died in the Indian wars . I had just enough money in my pocket for a drink . I forgot all about my errand . I returned home as the sun was setting . But I hand that couldn 't lose and no money left to bet with . Instead of thinking of Fanny and what she 'd been through , I satisfied my own cry by ... the battlefield in France during the first world war , I put another man in mortal danger in order to save my own son . I stole the formula ... While winning the affections of a good woman there , it became a game to me , I wasted precious time with a son and wife I dearly loved to chase fame and fortune . It 's a list of people he 's hurt in the past . People he needs to get right - right . I almost forgot , the crucial AA angle . Whoever Tara Brown Brooklyn is , it 's at the top of his list . The worst thing he did . Bad enough for Tara Brown Brooklyn to kill him . Or have an idea of who did . AA 's the connection . It 's a theory . Here on earth , we human detectives explore ... several theories as we gather the facts . I got this one . Ok . Marquez , stay with the vic . Run down the drug angle with the M.E. Let 's find out where Chris Duncan 's been since rehab , while mister sober over here finds out what Tara Brown Brooklyn means and what that has to do with the price of beans in Boston . Maybe he knocked her up , wrote a crummy song about it . Santori . You got your stun gun ? Chris Duncan ? There 's a singer by that name . That 's the one . How would I know Chris Duncan ? Not a lot of white rock singers on this block . Tara Brown . Fort Greene , Brooklyn . You 're the only one . Look , my baby 's sleeping , my son 's at school . I gotta take my shot . You could 've told me at the door you didn 't know Chris Duncan . You didn 't have to let me in . You 're a detective . I thought maybe you could help me . The cops that are on the case , they 've given up . Jason . My son ... He was nine . I sent him to the bodega . The baby needed milk . He got hit by a car . Killed . Hit-and-run . Who would do something like that ? Kill my baby ... Just drive away ? Tara , when did this happen ? The hit and run was the same night as the shelter benefit . Chris has a place in Park Slope . He 's loaded , going home . He kills a kid . Next day he checks into rehab . Cuts up his driver 's license . Well , M.E. Ruled Chris ' death a homicide . Methadone O.D. Same as Ollie . Chris was going to come clean with Tara Brown , but someone killed him before he had the chance . Why kill Ollie ? What 's the connection ? Are you John ? Yeah . I 'm sorry , but I have some bad news . Frank is dead . Heart attack . We kept him alive for a while last night , but he didn 't have a chance . Congenital arrhythmia . Since he was a kid . He never said . When he turned down the morphine , that 's when I knew . He wanted to die sober . Hmm . I got 93 days . God knows why , but when Ruby shoots Oswald ... That 's it for me . Good-bye , scotch . Thanks for coming . No choice . Frank told me if I didn 't , I 'd start drinkin ' again and die a hosrible death he was sorry he couldn 't hear your stuff . He said you gotta find somebody else quick . Another human being . That 's it ? Who are you , Jack the Ripper ? You 're supposed to read your list to somebody else . Ollie was Chris Duncan 's 'somebody else ' . He heard Chris ' confession . So , they met at the aa meeting . Chris liked him . He was a musician . For a big celebrity , who 's the safest person to tell your deepest secrets to ? A homeless guy . Chris read it to Ollie . Ollie was killed by someone who thought he ... was gonna give Chris up on the hit-and-run . And the guitar ? It was a gift . Chris was grateful . Something happens when you do this . I would 've given the moon to the person who heard mine . I walked . He followed . Did you see that ? Sarge , we 're talking about two murders and a dead kid . You go , girl . Ollie was killed because Chris told him about the hit-and-run . Chris was killed because he was about to ... spill his guilty rock star guts to Tara Brown , the hit-and-run 's mother . Who killed them ? Ooh . Don 't wait for him . See , this is a chick thing . We 're bonding . Whoever else was in Chris Duncan 's car . Bonded . It might be - it might be skipping . What 's wrong ? I googled you . Oh , no . I feel violated . It 's not funny . I mean , what are you ? The CIA ? Witness protection ? Sara . You 're something , because five years ago , you didn 't exist . I 'm a cop . Cops aren 't in public databases . Your partner is . The chief of detectives is . Family members , schools . Ask me anything . I 'll tell you . Why aren 't you in public databases ? Must be real bad . Something happened . I had to become someone else . What is it ? An undercover thing ? What 's your real name ? John Amsterdam . I like it . I 'd like to keep it . I 'd like to keep you . Trust me . Do I have a choice ? No . I had no choice . I had to tell you the truth . Might take a while . I , uh - I brought sandwiches . The truth about what ? You probably want to sit down . So , what ? You some kind of superhero ? Is this your secret lair ? No . You know how I always looked younger than the other dads ? Just listen , Omar . Please . The first family I abandoned was my own . In 1620 , when I came to the new world , I was 14 years of age . Hey ! I don 't care about papers . A black SUV . It hit him . Never even slowed down . Bad news . Chris Duncan never owned a black SUV . Hit-and-run in Fort Greene . Nine-year-old killed . That 's it . The whole story . And in the same day 's paper ... That 's the good news . He did . Ben Tucker . A black SUV , city-owned . Driver reported it stolen that night , during the concert . Recovered a week later . Stripped . I think we better talk to the councilman . No . Not Ben . Why are we here ? Looks different when you stop . A real place . A neighborhood . What are you doing ? It makes sense . Take me home right now . You talked to Chris in rehab . He called you from the hotel . You were sleeping with Chris Duncan . You can 't do this . After the show , he 's out of his mind on dope . Wants to go home . To Brooklyn . Your husband 's car , it 's right there . No . That didn 't happen . Jason Brown . That 's his name . Look out ! The boy you killed . He was nine years old . The car knocked him 28 feet . He landed right there . Killing a kid . A secret like that , keeping it inside , it eats you up . Now , Chris knew that . You gotta tell someone . If you don 't ... It kills ya . Watch out ! Who was driving ? You 're crazy . You 're gonna kill yourself . Telling someone . Letting go of the secret . I can 't . It 's the only way . Who was driving ? Get out of the street ! Who was driving ? I was ! I was driving . And two people were killed to protect your secret . Yeah ? Bob Webson . Ben Tucker 's driver . You write in haiku ? He 's on a methadone maintenance program . Injectable doses . Like what killed Ollie and Chris Duncan . We 'd like to bring him in . We 're the only two women in the house . You notice that ? Hard not to . Try harder . We 're cops , not women . Our bond is our work . That 's it . Councilman 's driver ? Bob . Go ahead . Pick him up . Marquez . Look where 'd you get your shoes ? My wife killed someone ? A kid ? She says she panicked . A bad accident , a strung out rock star in the car . She told me that she was going to go back to the shelter that night . You didn 't know about the accident until now ? Uh ... In her statement , your wife says she told you the next day . I would 've reported it . She says she wanted to , you told her not to . You said you 'd ' take care of it . ' Come on . I 've got her statement . I gotta get yours . Please . It 's my job . Please . Thanks , councilman . Her statement says Chris Duncan called her from rehab . I believe that . As part of his recovery program , Chris told someone about the accident . A homeless guy . Ollie Hardin . So , let me guess . Daphne says that she told me , and I killed Ollie to protect our little secret . No , Bob did . You had him shoot Ollie up with methadone . Made it look like an O.D. My driver . He can barely drive . Bob was terrified of being homeless . Ben played on that fear . If the secret came out , he 'd be back on the streets . So I made bob kill Ollie ? Chris Duncan , too . My wife ... She 's a very sick woman . And I 've spent years pretending that she wasn 't . The sleeping around , the lies . You think Chris Duncan was the first ? It was her . All of it . What , you think it was Bob 's idea to report the car stolen ? To kill two people ? The guy 's dumber than a box of hair . She probably didn 't even have to sleep with him more then once . No , I 'm sure it 's true . Everything she told you ... Except she did it . I didn 't say a word . I didn 't tell him anything . I stood by you . Tell him . She 's right . I think this is yours , sarge . She left it on my desk . A shopping list . No one 's gonna believe her . It 's her word against mine . Well , his , too , when Bob hears what you just said . Take him away . Ok , Sara . I could pick you up at work . Oh , me , too . So , we could be tired together . Exhausted . Ok . Sure , I ... You really want help , Mick ? Thanks for coming . I 'm glad to be here . I want to thank my pal Johnny , my buddy . Who-who are yow ? Mick . M-i-c-k . Alcoholic ? Huge . You know that . Johnny helped out Ollie , and now he 's helpin ' me . You know , no one 's ever left me anything before . Johnny tells me this gitbox is worth a little dough-re-mi , but I 'd never sell it . I 'm gonna learn how to play it . Stopped drinking ' ... Gotta do somethin ' . Right ? And when I stop bein ' an alcoholic ... No . You don 't get cured . You get better . That 's what Ollie always said . Mick ! Alcoholic ! One day ! Hi , Mick . Keep the change . Thanks . I blacked out . When I woke up , I was in a place for the insane . 'stranger told me you put me in there . ' That 's when I stopped drinking . ? my son . You deserve the truth . You all right ? Oh , boy . John , I 'm really beat . Me , too . That 's why I 'm here . The second we hit my bed , I am out . I 'm not going home with you . I can 't be with you , John . I don 't understand . That 's the problem . Neither do I. I don 't understand how I can be with someone who won 't tell me the truth . If I don 't understand something , I can 't make it work . I 'm a doctor . I need for things have to make sense . The heart attack . That 's what this is about . No , your heart . There 's something hidden in there . Something big . Some dark secret you won 't tell me . This is me . Right . John Amsterdam . The man with anomalous blood and no past at all , whose father did ' the best he could . ' well , he could 've done a little better . He could 've taught you to be honest . He didn 't . I picked that up myself . Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me you 're not hiding something . Tell me you were really undercover , that 's why there 's no history . If it 's true , I will believe it . I promise . That 's what I thought . You want the truth ? The truth is I 'm 400 years old . The truth is Omar is my son , one of 63 children I 've fathered . John - I 've tried to be careful because I can 't stay with them . I 'm immortal , they 're not . - The truth is- - - Stop . Just stop .

 Previously on the 4400 ... Kevin 's a genius , you know , but he doesn 't brag about it . Kevin , did you just speak to me ? I haven 't said anything for a long time . Try six years . You 're saying that Burkhoff is the father of the 4400 technology . I can think again too . Kyle never came home last night . Kyle said he blacked out . You could 've come to me , told me what was going on . He 's your cousin , your friend . Kyle thinks he did something during one of his blackouts . He seemed really freaked out about it . If it happened during one of his blackouts , he wouldn 't need a reason . I don 't remember them telling me to turn my son into a murderer . I kept hoping i was wrong about it . This is not Kyle 's doing . You 've got to hold onto that . Kyle ... you weren 't in control of your actions , Kyle . You did not kill Jordan Collier . Forget about the flight . Bring Kyle home . They just arrested a suspect in the Collier killing . We caught that man , the one that we were looking for . It 's all over . Not yet . Thursday , July 28 5 : 37 pm Mommy , i 'm scared . I know , baby . I 'm scared too . But it 's going to be okay , because mommy 's here . Okay ? Whatever 's coming through that door ... I 'll protect you . * so long ago , another life * * i can feel your heart beat * * it 's not a dream remember us * * i can see it in your eyes * * we 'll find our place in time * * our place in time beyond the sun * * we 'll find our place in time * * our place in time to call our own * Thursday , July 28 7 : 22 am Ten Hours Earlier Today is Jordan Collier 's Birthday He died on NTAC 's watch What does that mean ? What 's what means ? Nothing . Just some crank ... it 's nothing . Guess it 's Jordan Collier 's birthday . The state of washington gave him a birthday present . Did you read this ? They 're talking like it 's an open-and-shut case . He made threats against Collier . Two witnesses picked him out of a lineup . But they 're wrong . Roy marsden didn 't kill Jordan Collier . And neither did you , Kyle . You told me he 'd never see a courtroom . They want to execute this guy . It 's not going to happen , Kyle . No one can put him up on that roof . Any ... any public defender will have a motion to dismiss in front of a judge by this time next week . What if you 're wrong ? What if they find him guilty ? What am i supposed to do ? Nothing ? Marsden has been in and out of jail since he was 15 . Theft , assault , attempted rape ... but he didn 't kill anybody . And he 's not going to be convicted of it , Kyle . I 'm not going to let it happen . Neither will i . Kyle , it 's not going to be easy , but you 're going to have to start putting all this behind you . It 's your first day back at school , and i want you focused and fierce , and thinking about " a " s . Okay . Okay . All right . Sweetie ... Mrs. Benke 's going to be here any minute . It 's time to get up . I don 't feel good . You 've got a real fever , young lady . Hey , how long have you had that ? Dishonest ? No , no , no . I don 't think we 're being dishonest at all . Human beings use less than 20 % of their brain capacity . Everything else is just ... collecting cobwebs . Here at the 4400 center , we 're trying to tap into that unused potential . So your own ability , you believe it stems from increased brainpower ? Show me another explanation . Look , whether you believe that we were taken to the future or not , somebody did change us , and they used technology to do it . We 're just trying to figure out how and share it . But " first keys , " " second keys , " " unlocking the ability inside you ... " you have to admit that the terminology is more religious than scientific . Well , the movement is part faith , part science . It 's a potent combination . So what time was your appointment for ? They told me 11 : 15 ... but they always tell me 11 : 15 . I never get in before 12 : 00 , 12 : 30 . Hey , free health care , right ? So what if they 're so slow ? Compulsory free health care . You don 't show up for a quarterly checkup , you 've got the goon squad knocking at your door . You don 't like it ? Don 't show . Doubt they 'd slap the cuffs on someone 's grandma . Does it itch at all ? Here . 103.1 . No wonder you wanted to stay in bed . Is it some kind of flu ? Most likely . Is it okay if we keep her here for a few hours ? I want to go home . I know you do , honey , but dr . Hudson is going to take very good care of you , and i 'll look in on you as often as i can . I wish i brought Lemon . That 's her stuffed dog . Let me guess . He 's yellow . Yeah . Well , i could go back and get him . You have a very nice mommy . I try . About this rash ... now , i worked at the C. D. C. For seven years , and i never saw anything like it . It 's kind of a weird shape , huh ? Yeah . Don 't read too much into it . It could still be hives ... an allergic reaction . We 'll take care of it . Sweetie , you 'll be okay here if i go get lemon ? Okay , my darling . Bye , darling . When daddy 's away , he misses Isabelle so much . But traveling around the country , talking to all sorts of people , clueing them in about my life ... it 's kind of fun . Shawn 's amazing . This woman comes in . Her c . A. T. Scan says she 's got a brain tumor the size of a walnut . 20 minutes later , she 's on her way . Good as new . Hmm . I 'll feed her . She 's not hungry yet . How do you know ? She told me before you came in . So she 's talking to me . Communicating . Same as she does with you . - Since when ? - This morning . I thought you 'd be happy . First time she ever said anything to me . That 's great . It 's just ... she hasn 't said anything to me for weeks . I wouldn 't worry about it . It 's just how you used to tell me ... kids always alternate between parents . It 's normal ... just with Isabelle , it comes with a twist . This is major Charles Culp of the National Security Agency 's field enforcement división . D. C. Has loaned us his services . Effective immediately , the major and his team will be providing backup in any 4400 cases requiring armed intervention . We know this office bears a heavy caseload , and we 're here to help when needed . Welcome aboard . Hope you guys are up to it , ' cause i 'm going to have you on speed dial . We 'll stay out of your way , let you do your jobs . When the time comes , we hope you 'll return the favor . Well , the last lady that we went up against released poison spores from her palms , so , uh ... if you want to track her down instead of me ... by all means . My men and i are used to unique challenges . How long have we been asking for tactical support ? Eight months . I guess someone up there likes us . You guys check your emails this morning ? " Happy birthday , Jordan Collier " ? Everyone in the building got that one . Maybe Marco should have one of his guys try to backtrack it . They already did . It came from a public terminal in an internet cafe . It was a new email account . Nice to know Collier 's still got his fans . What 's that ? It 's valerian root or something . I don 't know . Alana swears by it . They calm me down a little . My suggestion ? Double your dosage . The Baldwin trigger has been a little " hair " lately . My girlfriend agrees with you . I need you to cover me for an hour . Maia 's got the flu or something , and Hudson wants her to spend the day here . She okay ? I 'm sure it 's nothing . I mean , i was sure that it was the bubonic plague , but her doctor tells me that it 's nothing . So you plowed into some guy and got away with it ? That 's kind of a weird way to put it . Well , the perks of having a dad at N. T. A. C. , i guess . And this guy you hit , how messed up was he ? I can 't really talk about it . You know , it 's lawyer stuff . Who am i going to tell ? I broke both his legs and his collarbone . That 's it ? He was in a car , Danny . It 's not like i mowed over a pedestrian . Yeah , but you kept talking about this " awful thing " you did . I thought you killed somebody . What ? Well , thanks a lot , man . So did Shawn . Well , sorry to disappoint you guys . Well , look , do me a favor , okay ? If you get in trouble again , tell somebody . There 's nothing you can tell me or Shawn that we can 't handle . Next time i black out and have a car accident , you 'll be the first to know . Yeah , long as i 'm not riding shotgun . Oh , hey , listen , you want to go see arcade fire with me on friday night , or do you have to stay home and nurse your guilty conscience ? No nursing . I 'll go . - Yeah ? - I 'll go . - All right . - Yeah . It 's good to have you back . Good to be back . I got to go . Okay . See you . You hear that ? That buzz ? What is it ? What ? Is that coming from your gadget ? Is what coming from my gadget ? That noise . I don 't hear anything . Neither do i . What is that noise ? You hear that ? What 's going on ? I 've got , like , a headache . Did you hear that ? A gift from me to you Have fun trying to survive the day Why is my signature on this requisition ? Because i had to get it in ! Do not sign my name on another report . They sit on your desk for weeks . If there 's a space for my signature , it should be my signature ! Foster and mcclenahan are tearing each other apart by the elevator . Right before this started , there was a noise . I didn 't hear anything . Yeah , well , the rest of us did ! There was some kind of high-pitched whine , and we got another one of those emails . It said , " have fun trying to survive the day . " Show me . Okay , everybody try to stay calm . If this noise or signal did something to you ... you 've got to fight it . What she 's talking about ? What did i just tell you ? - Nina . - You saw it . She pulled her weapon first . I was defending myself ... how is she ? Breathing . She 's bleeding pretty bad . Get her to medical . Park is under arrest . Crowley , restrain him . Baldwin , what are you doing ? Until we know what 's going on , nobody gets in and nobody goes out . What 's going on ? Security procedure enabled . Who 's a very good girl ? Isabelle is . Isabelle 's a smartie . Glad to see you guys are having fun . Lily . I didn 't expect to see you till 5 : 00 . Well , i 'm taking an early lunch . I thought i 'd take Isabelle out to the garden . That sounds fun . Doesn 't it , little girl ? Oh , i use flash cards with her all the time . Let 's see if i can find an apple . It 's her favorite . What is this ? Someone 's been mixing up our cards . I 've told them a million times . What do you use these for ? These don 't belong in the nursery . I think they use them for the applicants . Part of their psych profile . Sorry . Okay , Isabelle . Going to go with mommy . Okay . See you real soon . Well , the movement is part faith , part science . It 's a potent combination . The movement 's 100,000 members would certainly agree , but Kevin Burkhoff , a neuroscientist at western washington university , thinks otherwise . Uh , i don 't question anybody 's faith . Why should i ? Faith is a good thing , right ? But what they 're doing over there at the center has nothing to do with science . I mean , you tell me how fasting , meditation , and chanting can alter , in any way , your neurochemistry . It 's preposterous . It 's a good scam , but still preposterous . " Scam . " That 's a strong word . It fits . They 're taking this kernel of truth about the brain 's potential , and using it to bilk people out of their life savings . A lot of people might be surprised by your stance . After all , you suffered from paranoid personality disorder for years . Wasn 't it a device engineered by a 4400 that cured you ? Yes , and i 'm grateful , but you need to make the distinction between the 4400 and the 4400 center . 4400s have remarkable abilities ... everybody knows it ... but the center is co-opting that phenomenon for profit . Those machines they 're hooking people up to over there ? They might as well not even be plugged in . If you ask me , he still looks rather demented . He seemed pretty sane to me , Matthew , especially when he was ripping us ... Shawn , don 't overreact . It 's just one interview . Oh ... You did good , though . Yeah . Garrity , give me the gun . Look , this is crazy , Baldwin . How are we going to defend ourselves ? Whoever 's doing this wants us to attack each other . If we stay armed , we 're dead by the end of the day . If we don 't , we 'll be slaughtered . Look , everyone in the building is under the effects of this thing , okay ? The cafeteria staff could be forming an army right now . Which is why i 'll find out who 's doing this and stop it . They 're doing checkups in the medical lab today . That means there 's 4400s in the building . You think that one of them is behind this ? I ... I don 't know , but right now , it 's all i have to go on . You ? Who put you in command ? He 's not . I am . This building is the target of a 4400 terrorist attack . It is now a military situation . This is great , Baldwin . Why don 't you explain to these guys why they should just lay down their arms , huh ? Major Culp , the signal , whatever it is , it 's like someone set off a rage bomb . It 's pumping up the aggressión of everybody in the building . The men , anyway . We cannot be walking around with loaded firearms . My team 's trained to resist psychological pressure tactics . This is a 4400 ability . You can 't resist it . There 's 4400s down in the med lab . It 's probably one of them doing it . Baldwin was just headed down there right now . Cartwright , watch them . Everyone else , with me . Just wait . Wait . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to find out which one of them 's responsible for this . And then what ? I 'm going to make sure that it stops . Be careful . There 's a little girl down there . If it 's not her , then she has nothing to worry about . You have to let me out ! We got to get out ! We 're going to get killed ! Would you stop saying that already ? It 's not helping . An " a " ? That 's great . But what 's my name doing on here ? Well , we 're lab partners , right ? This is our presentation . But i haven 't met with you in almost three weeks . I didn 't type a word of this . Well , it 's not like you didn 't do anything . You said you wanted to do a paper on mitosis . You stained the slides . One or two of them , maybe . Look ... you were in trouble , right ? I just figured that whatever it was , you could probably do without an " incomplete " in bio . I still don 't know if i deserve this , but thank you . What can i say ? I have a soft spot for stray cats . I look that pathetic ? Hardly . You 're shooting up ? Doesn 't exactly fill me with confidence . It 's a sedative . If i lose control and become like everyone else in this place , i can 't help you anymore . What 's happening to my agents ? I don 't feel any different , but they 're all going crazy . Dr. Hudson ? I feel worse . You shouldn 't be out of bed . Sweetie , what 's that on your arm ? Skouris , N. T. A. C. I need to get past . Building 's locked down . Well , what 's going on ? Security breach from the inside . That 's all we know . - I have to get through . - That 's not going to happen . You don 't understand . My daughter 's in there . Thursday , July 28 3 : 19 pm Well , I can 't do it myself . Turn around . Hold still . I can 't believe you broke my nose . Yeah , well , you broke my knuckle when i hit you . But i 'm still right . The signal is constant . It doesn 't matter if you can hear it or not . It 's like a dog whistle . It 's one pulse , and it 'll wear off . We just have to wait it out ... Both of you guys shut up ! I 'm trying to get work done . Not a good time , Diana . Marco , what 's going on in there ? Depends on who you ask . Somebody 's definitely set off a whammy in here . Something 's pumping up our " fight or flight " instincts . Heavy emphasis on the " fight " part . Well , Marco , i need to get inside , and i need your help . Every male in this building has got a gallon of adrenaline coursing through his veins right now . And most of them are armed . If you 're on the outside , stay there . Listen to me , Marco . Maia is inside , and i need to get to her . Do you have access to the building schematics ? Uh , yeah . I can pull them up . Do it . And what do i get in return ? Well , we can talk about that later . Good . Good . I 'm going to hold you to that . Get off me . You 're in my space ! Hang on . - You 're in my space ! - Guys ! Settle it later ! We 've got to get Skouris into the building . I said get on your knees . I just need to take these . They 're keeping me calm . Little late for that . You sure you don 't want one ? They might help . Cut us loose . Come on . Cut me free . Get some cuffs . Put them on commando-boy . Then you can let everybody else go . Hey , hey , where are you going ? I 'm going to the med labs . Hopefully the major met some resistance along the way . What kind of tests ? You mean like an i . Q. Thing ? I don 't know , Richard . Those flash cards were weird , and after we got back , i was changing her . She has these marks on her skin . Marks ? Bruises ? No . Like irritations . Like someone had her hooked up to something . Let me see . They faded . Richard ... don 't look at me like that . I 'm not imagining things . She 's not going back to that nursery . Lily ... all you 've been talking about is how much you love ruth and the nursery , and how much Isabelle seems to love it there . I wish you 'd been there . I mean , ruth , she had this weird smile on her face . Think about what you 're saying . Nobody 's doing tests on her at the nursery . You know , i know you feel like she 's shutting you out , and no offense , but maybe this is an overreaction . - Can i take her for a second ? - No . Lily , what are you doing ? I 'm sorry . It 's just this place . I feel like it 's changing everything , like it 's changing us . We 're okay . Everything 's okay . The meditation courses , the synaptic potential readers , and our purification seminars ... that 's half our curriculum you 're putting on the chopping block . We don 't need them , Matthew . Jordan seemed to think we did . Jordan 's not here anymore , is he ? Besides , that Burkhoff guy is right ... a bunch of chanting is not going to unlock the 4400 inside of anyone . Whether it will or it won 't , the product is selling . Wait , wait , wait . " product " ? This is not a pyramid scheme , Matthew . People are coming here , they 're looking to be changed . They 're looking for answers . And we 'll find them , but if we change , we look weak . For now , all that matters is that people believe in what we 're doing . I need to believe in it , too . Nobody move ! They 're gone . They all took off . Who are you ? Roger wolcott . I 'm just here for my checkup . The 4400 ? Why else would i be here ? Now cut me loose ! Thursday , July 28 4 : 22 pm That 's not going to hold anybody . Not for long . Let 's hope no one finds us . What do you think our chances are ? The calmer we are , the longer we stay alive . How are you doing , sweetie ? I feel all sweaty , and it 's getting hard to breathe . Poor baby . I have something for you . - Lemon . - Yeah . As soon as this is over , i 'm going to get you to the hospital , okay ? All right . I 'm guessing you don 't have a stuffed animal for me . Maybe a fifth of Jack Daniels ? Sorry . Looks like it 's starting to clot . You need another shot for pain ? No . You need the sedatives more than i do . How many shots have you taken ? Three . And you 're still on your feet ? Shouldn 't that have knocked you on your ass by now ? Well , on a normal day , i 'd be out for the next 12 hours , but today , it 's barely enough to keep me sane . Well , thank you ... for keeping Maia safe . She 's a sweet kid . Listen , Diana ... look , i 've only got three shots left . They 're wearing off a little faster each time , so ... i don 't want to hurt anybody . I don 't want to kill anybody . So if i ... start to go ... oh , don 't worry . I 'll take care of you . Do me a favor ... back of the head , okay ? You 'll never see it coming . Now , listen , Hudson ... look , i just gave you permissión to blow my head off . Why don 't you call me Max ? All right , Max . About this signal ... which one of these bitches do you think is sending it ? I don 't see what this has to do with anything . Hey , you wanted to know my story . Well , right now , you 're living it . Open your eyes . Now , imagine three years went by while you had them shut . Can 't do it . Neither could i ... but they were gone . I missed senior year of high school , which is supposedly the best year ever . I got robbed . The rest of high school just sucked . So this blackout that you had behind the wheel , that was some sort of after-effect of the coma ? Yeah . Wow . God , you 've been through so much . You 're jealous ? What part sounds good ? The coma ? The hit and run ? I 'm jealous because you have all this experience under your belt . It makes you interesting . But i didn 't do it . It wasn 't me . Great , so now someone can kill me in my sleep . How do you know it 's one of us ? Well , i don 't , but none of you are talking , and so i 'm about out of options . This isn 't going to make a damn bit of difference . That 's it . No more sedatives . Can you still function as a doctor ? For now . Kind of busy here , Diana . We just put the 4400s under , but we 're not sure if that 's killed the signal . Do you still feel amped up ? Yes , i do , okay ? I 'm working on it from my end . What 's that noise ? I 'm trying to counter the effects of the signal . If you 'd just shut up for a second , maybe i could find the right frequency ... Okay , calm down , Marco . I need you to do this . It always has to be me , doesn 't it ? Old , reliable Marco does whatever you want . I truly believe in what we 're trying to do . The 4400 are the template for the next stage in human evolution . Do you mind backing up ? You 're standing a little close . We can recreate the technology they used to change us . Not by chanting " om " three times , you can 't . Agreed ... but if you come to work with us , we could get somewhere . You know , the government has approached me half a dozen times . They seem to have this bizarre theory i 'm the father of this new branch of science . I turned them down . I don 't like working with people with badges . Listen , you can 't blame them for being curious . You were in a mental hospital for ... six years ? The future busted its ass to get you working again . I haven 't forgotten my debts . Oh ? What 's that ? Signing bonus ? Fancy car ? Me . I 'm the póster boy , right ? Healing hands . Unlimited access . Can you really turn that down ? Mommy , i 'm scared . I know , baby . I 'm scared too . But it 's going to be okay , because mommy 's here . Okay ? Whatever 's coming through that door ... i 'll protect you . Tom . Tom ... put the gun down . It 's me . It 's Diana . No , you 'll ... you 'll shoot me if i put it down . No , Tom . I don 't want to hurt you . Well , i want to hurt you , Diana . Tom ... i said calm down . My mom always wanted me to hit it off with a cute doctor , but make another move , and i will pull this trigger . What is that ? That 'd be Marco earning his paycheck . I feel like an idiot . It 's just ... Isabelle and i were so close for so long . And you still are . I know . It 's like you say ... she 's a baby . It isn 't personal . Yeah , you just have to remember that . Hey , ruth , look who 's back . That was a long lunch . Yeah , sorry . Time got away from us . Come on . Here you are . We 'll be back in an hour for her . - We 'll be here . - Thank you . Bye , Isabelle . I 'd still like to do a little house-hunting . We could take a look around , see what 's out there . You 're in charge until i 'm released . Pool whatever manpower is still up walking . Start picking up the pieces . - I 'll handle it . - Mm-hmm . All right . And you get that head looked at . How are you doing ? Well , for a slender lady , you pack a punch . I can 't take all the credit . Culp softened you up a little bit . Hmm . It 's the final tally . Three agents dead , two N. S. A. Operatives , a 4400 ... concussions , broken bones , stab wounds ... yikes . It 's tough to swallow . It was a major attack , and we weren 't ready . Yeah . How are you , baby ? Okay . Not so good . I 've got her on glucose and erythromycin . We 're going to get her over to St. Michael 's and see if we can bring that fever down . And the rash ? I 'm going to bring in a specialist . Should i be worried ? Brett Kellerman is one of the best dermatologists in the city . I 'm sure he 'll figure it out . You 're coming with us , right ? Of course . I 'll be right there in the ambulance with you . All right , i 'll get to the hospital as soon as i can . Okay . - Oh , Max ... - yeah . Thank you ... for everything . No , thank you , for ... well , for not putting one in the back of my head . Uh , so those 4400s Diana was protecting ... they 're not going to see daylight until N. T. A. C. ' s sure they 're not responsible for this . That 's going to be a marathon debriefing sessión . Yeah , i bet you they 'll both be up all night . Both ? I thought Diana said there was three of them . Tom ? She 's gone . A 4400 nearly took down a fortified government facility , and walked away without breaking a sweat . Do they even have a name for that ? Yeah , " terrorism . " Payback is a bitch . Welcome to the center . Would you like to sign up for the tour ? No . Tell Shawn Farrell that Kevin Burkhoff is here to see him . I 'm sorry . Mr. Farrell 's busy at the moment . Is there a message i can pass along ? Yes . I want to get started immediately . You can stay over if you like . Get some dinner , do a little studying ... Kyle ? Are you okay ? I don 't deserve you . That is so sweet . I 'll be right back . Okay . Shawn ... this is Olivia Cohen . Take a seat here . Mm-hmm . That 's good . She lost her eyesight to macular degeneration 10 years ago . The foundation was very moved by her story . Hi , Mrs. Cohen . Hello . It 's nice to meet you . So , uh , what we 're going to do here is going to feel a little weird , but when we 're done , you 'll be able to see again . Oh , i can 't wait . I have to admit , i 'm a little nervous . You don 't have to be . I 'm going to take your hands now , okay ? Mm-hmm . Here we go . Here we go . So when does it start ? When do i see again ? Just give me a moment . Shawn ? Oh ... What 's wrong ? I don 't know . Is it warm in here ?

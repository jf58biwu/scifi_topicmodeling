He got into an argument with his parents and- - - He killed them ? - It was an accident . His emotions got the better of him .

Both : Sorry . - [ sighs ] So , um , you were saying How you didn 't really like me that way ? - No . You were saying that .

Bennet 's . - How 'd you get in here ? - We told them that I was your aunt . - My aunt ? I don 't have an aunt . - You do now . Mr. Bennet fixed some paperwork and here I am . - Mr. Bennet said that everything would go away ... That the cops would buy the story . Mr. Bennet ... Said they 'd let me go . - Hey . All I have to do is sign you out . - That might not be such a good idea . - Why not ? - I killed my parents . I 'm a murderer . - You can 't control me . You 've never been able to do that . - Well , I had a compelling reason . Let 's face it . Your wife is kind of hot . - Enough ! - That is the second parkman I made scream today . [ chuckles ] If you want , I can give you some pointers later . - Crazy psycho ! - What are you gonna do ? Hit me ? Defend your lady 's honor ? We both know it 's not about that . It 's about all those other things I can do to her ... And matty , next time I take over your body . That 's when the real fun begins . - Hmm , cozy . - Oh , my god . Do you smell that ? It smells like something died in here . - What is this place ? - Oh , my god . - Slaughterhouse . - Oh , my- - - Please don 't say that again . - Hey , guys ? Super-cute puzzle over here . " what you find will help you survive . When we were found will keep you alive .

Now we are going to bring it . - [ whimpers ] no . Can I just stay here ? - Jeremy ... What happened with your parents ... I understand . All you did was touch them . The day that I discovered my ability , I killed a man . He was threatening me . I grabbed him and something took over . Something inside of me . And no matter how hard I tried ... - You couldn 't let go . - Your emotions took over . You got mad . For most people , that 's not a bad thing . - [ inhales deeply ] - We 're not most people . - [ sobbing ] - I 'm gonna get you out of here . - His next of kin is here . What possible reason do you have for holding him ? - Well , we got plenty . - Is this jeremy 's ? - Gil , show him what we found . - " I feel the darkness surrounding me . I am the bringer of death . " - He 's 17 years old . Half the songs in his ipod sound just like that . - Well , maybe I should read you the part About killing animals . Any kid at school will tell you he does it ... For fun . - So now we 're taking gossip as evidence , is that it ? - There 's something wrong with that boy , okay ? Far as I 'm concerned , this proves it . He ain 't getting away with killing his family . He 's staying right here . - No , they still haven 't charged him . Their evidence is circumstantial at best . Yes , right now . I 'm calling in a favor , denis . [ sighs ] Thank you . All right , I 'll see you then . - Sounds like you 're shaking things up in there . From the looks of the place , I 'd say they could use it . - Is that right ? - Tell me something . How 's a girl like you end up in a place like this ? - Oh , you have to do better than that . - The name is samuel . And I 'm here to ask you one question . If you 're here to save young jeremy 's life , Then what 's next ? You gonna take him to a place just to live ? Or where he belongs ? - What did you do ? - It 's all right . - Stay back . - I 'm a friend , tracy . - How do you know my name ? - It 's all right . You 're safe here . I 'm like you . We 're all like you . - What is this place ? - Home . - Slaughter floor or operation center ? Should I even ask ? - Have a nice hell week . - After you . - Ugh . So , uh , how long have you known ? - Known what ? That I really don 't want to be in this sorority ? - That you like girls . - [ scoffs ] You make it sound like I have to declare , Like , it 's my major or something . - I 'm actually jealous . First year of college And you 've already figured yourself out . - Hmm . I don 't know about that . Truth is I 've had more boyfriends than girlfriends . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . - How many more ? - Eh ... Six or seven . That 's not a lot , right ? - Sounds about right . - Hey , you 're not- - No , you couldn 't be . You were a cheerleader . - Not what ? - A virgin ? - [ scoffs ] - Wow ! [ chuckles ] We could not be more different . Maybe we 're strange attractors . - Strange attractors ? - It 's a physics thing . Everything in the universe has a magnetic charge , right ? So strange attractors are particles that end up together That don 't really belong together , But when they 're together , they 're super-powerful . Sort of like we could be ? Or not . What ? - Shh . Hold on . [ metal clanging ] - Come on . Don 't tell me you 're freaked out now . I mean , look . See ? Nothing . Just more lameness . - Gretch ! [ grunts ] - What the hell was that ? - I 'm starting to think this isn 't a game . - This is the life jeremy could have . - What ? Working at a carnival ? - Surrounded by family . His true family . Do you remember the first time you experienced your gift ? - " gift " might be a little generous . - Like the entire universe coursing through you All at once . That wasn 't just your ability , tracy . You were tapping into something greater than yourself . We 're all connected . - I 'd like to believe that . - Believe it . Every time someone joins this family , I get a feeling in here . It 's an energy , I guess . It gets stronger every day . This is where jeremy should be . - What , living in trailers , drifting from town to town ? - What would you do ? Give him a false name ? A false life ? This is a boy who can work miracles . Why should he be invisible ? Bring him home ! You could join him . I know you 've been lost too . It 's your nature . - That 's enough . Just take me back now . - Fair enough . Look , I 'm never out the hard sell , But please take this To find your way back here . This is lydia . She 'll take you from here . - I know her . I helped her . She came to me when she was sad . - I know . - I held her in my arms . We were flying . - We 've talked about this . The memories you 're having , they 're not yours . - Then whose are they ? And if the real me isn 't in here ... Then where am I ? - Matt , what are you doing ? - Uh ... I have to leave . It 's just- - it 's not safe for you and matty . - Why ? - Because ... Someone else can control me . My body . - Someone else ? Matt , why do you always do this ? Come on . We 're just getting close . We 're going on 15 years And you want to blow everything up again ? - Janice ? Janice ? Look , I did a terrible thing . - Aw , this should be good . - I used my ability to push one man 's memories Into another man 's head . - Yeah , my head . There is somebody out there using my body Without my permission . - I didn 't even know that you could do that . - It was wrong . I know that . But I had to do it to get rid of this really bad criminal . - Well , that 's not very nice . - Or at least just his mind . And now his consciousness is rattling around Up in here . - Well , there 's so much space . - Will you shut up ? Janice--janice , look . I can get rid of him . The answer 's out there . I just got to go find it . - Good luck . - I need you to trust me , okay ? - I 'm gonna give you guys a moment . Do your thing . - You trust me , right ? Come on , you said it yourself . A decade and a half . That 's worth something , right ? I can fix this . - Okay . Okay . Um ... You need a place to work things out . You should stay here . - No . - No , I insist . It 's safer for you here . And I 'll take matty and we 'll go and stay with- - - Don 't ! Don 't tell me where you 're gonna go . I don 't want him to hear . - Okay . Okay . I love you . - That 's good . - [ groans ] That was pretty smart even for you , Not letting her tell me where she 's gonna be . But you still haven 't figured out How to get rid of me , genius . - Mohinder , look . I have no idea where you are . Just--will you do me a favor ? Call me back , okay ? When you get this , just call me . - Mohinder ? How 's he gonna help you ? He 's probably still working [ imitating mohinder ] on his father 's research . Why don 't you try your old lady ? See if she picks up . [ chuckles ] Forget it , parkman . It is time for you to give me back my body And just ... Accept it . I 'm ... Gaining ground and I- - [ coughs ] I can ... Make you do whatever ... I want . - Yeah ? This is hurting you a little bit , isn 't it ? - [ chuckles ] You wish . - You know , you 're right . I mean , you slept with my wife . You can control me at any time , right ? All right . Control me . Stop me from drinking this beer . Come on . Come on ! Stop me ! - [ coughs ] - Oh . [ chuckles ] Why don 't we see how you do ... Against the heavy artillery . - [ grunting ] Wait . - I think I 've finally found a leash for this dog . - There you are . Your guy came through . He made all the arrangements . - That 's great . - You all right ? - Yeah . Yeah , let 's just- - let 's get him out of here . - Thanks . - Hey . - Jeremy , they 're letting you go . - But who am I gonna live with ? - You 'll be a few doors down from me In my apartment building in d.C. I 've set up a new identity for you . Your name is jarod mitchell And you 're going to attend georgetown high school . - So nobody will know what I can do ? - You 'll learn to control your ability with tracy 's help . But you 're gonna keep it to yourself . It 's the only way . - What if something happens ? - Nothing 's going to happen . You 'll be safe . You 'll be invisible . - What , you think a sorority brought us out here To kill us ? That 's ridiculous . It 's just a game . - It didn 't just move itself . - Well , there was no one else there . How else would you explain it ? - In my world , there 's a million ways . - Name one . - Telekinesis . I 've seen it . Heck , I know someone who has it . - So wait , you 're saying there 's Another one of you here ? - It 's very possible . - And what ? They 're bored and they 're playing A college prank on you ? - Not a prank . - You think that they 're trying to kill you ? - Not me . - Then who ? Me ? Come on . - Think about it . My first roommate committed suicide With a mysterious note that wasn 't there , but then it was . I mean , maybe you almost getting gutted Wasn 't a coincidence . - Claire , that is a little out there . Sounds like some crazy-ass conspiracy theory . Which pretty much describes your entire life . [ metal lurching ] - What was that ? - I don 't know . - [ screams ] - Ash , cut it out . Come on . - Hey , you guys all right ? You find another clue ? - Like I 'm gonna tell you . - Look , your roommate 's freaked out And we don 't care about the treasure . Let 's just stick together , get the hell out of here , And once we find it , you can have it . Deal ? - Okay , can we just go ? - Deal . - Lead the way . [ indistinct chatter ] - We 'll take my car . Straight ahead . [ indistinct chatter and shouting ] - We know what happened to your parents ! - We know what you did ! We know what you did . [ chatter continues ] - hey ! You 're getting away with murder , you ... - Don 't ! - Hey ! - Don 't hurt him ! - Jeremy , stop . Let him go . - Get the hell away from him ! - Jeremy ! - No ! - Jeremy , you can save him ! - Everyone back ! Back ! - Jeremy , listen to me . You can help him . You can save him . - Everybody stand back ! Now listen , son . You 're going back in there where you belong . You know what you did to your mama and your daddy . - Save him . You can do it . [ sound becomes muffled ] - Jeremy ! - You do not understand the first thing About what 's happening here . - Three people are dead . I understand that . And that boy , whatever he is , is responsible ! - Hey , do you want it to happen again ? Just let me talk to him . - Talk to him ? You 're through talking to him . Both of you . - You think killers go free , huh ? Not in this town . - Gil , where 's the boy ? Gil , do you read ? The boy is gone . Gil , do you read me ? Are you there ? - Not so tough now , are you ? Go ahead . Take your best shot . Give me a reason . You 're not normal . - [ chuckles ] - You don 't belong here . [ engine starts ] - Go . - [ grunts ] You like that ? You know what this is ? I bought this with janice On our anniversary trip to ensenada . And it is so poetic that I am using it to bury you . - Bury me or drown the truth ? - The truth , what ? That you--you 're nothing ? You 're just a figment of my imagination . - [ grunts ] - Let 's quiet those voices , shall we ? - [ grunts ] Your wife walked out on you . You think she wanted to give you your space . She can 't stand the sight of you . Pathetic . You know what she said to me In front of the fire last night ? " why can 't you be more like this all the time ? " - When you 're gone ... Janice and I are gonna have a beautiful life together . - [ grunts ] You 're so desperate to fit in . Why can 't you accept your power ? Why do you insist on being so forgettable ? - Oh , man . You 're afraid . You 're afraid of dying . And you just passed out . You just passed out . [ laughs ] Yes ! Oh ! - Matt ? - Parkman ? - Honey , I did it . I really did it . [ grunts ] - " kill house . " " prep room . " " kill house " sounds more dangerous . We 're taking that one . - I thought we were gonna stick together . - [ scoffs ] no way . - Let 's just check this real quick . We 'll catch up to them . Well , we won . Kind of . I 'm gonna go get paris and nicole . I get it , by the way . - You get what ? - You wanting to run from your freaky world And live a normal life . I shouldn 't have put you on the spot And gotten all relationship-y on you . The last thing you need right now is- - - I need you . Trust me . - What ? - Gretchen ! - [ chokes ] - [ grunts ] - [ coughs and gasps ] [ coughing ] what 's going on ? Oh , my god ! Claire ! - Oh ... My ... - God ! Becky ? - Grab her !

Tracy , I 'm sorry . - You know , this was supposed to be simple . Just go in and sign him out . - I thought I could manage it . - By hiding him away for the rest of his life ? - I stood on his porch and I told him That I wouldn 't let him down . - But you did . We did . - I did what I thought was right . And I was wrong . I 've been wrong all these years . - Do we have to be invisible ? You ever think we could just live , noah ? Out in the open ? - Not after today , no . - Don 't ever call me again . [ engine starts ] - [ grunts ] - Hi . - Hey . - You gave us quite a scare there , brother . - Oh . I know . I 'm sorry . I just , um- - I had to see if , uh- - If I could , um- - I 'm much better now . - Not quite . We start over from the beginning . You hear me ? - Yeah . Thanks . Both of you . - I love you . - Hmm . You 'll love me a lot more after I take a shower . [ grunts ] [ sighs ] - Let me guess . You want your body back ? Did you think you were actually winning ? The second you blacked out , I slipped right in . Now I 'm in the driver 's seat . - You 'll never get away with this . - I already have . [ chuckles ] [ deep rumbling ]

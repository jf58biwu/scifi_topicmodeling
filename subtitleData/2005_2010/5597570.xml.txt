 I 'm not going to spend the next six months ... traipsing around this stinking jungle . We 've got to find this place . Just plug in the coordinates . Damn it , I can 't get anything . Give me those figures again . 86.7 , 1209 . 1356 ... 39.3 , 1118 , 74.9 . I 'm sorry , sir , I just can 't seem to get a fix . - Either the coordinates are wrong ... - The coordinates are not wrong ! Where are you ? Aeon ! Come , come , dearest ! How can she have just disappeared ? All she knows is how to destroy . - Lf she finds it before we do ... - She won 't , sir ! Everything that rises must converge . Who are you ? What 's this all about ? I was falling ... Hey ! Wait a minute ! This is Colloden , isn 't it ? So much for your coordinates , Trevor . You 're wet . This is elegant . Well , well ! Well , what do you think ? Thank you for the dry clothes . Very sweet of you . Maybe you can do me another favour ? There 's a laboratory ... Bring the suits , we 're going in . What happened here ? What the flame does not consume consumes the flame . - Is everybody dead ? - Unborn . - Been here a long time , have you ? - Forever . What will we find in here , I wonder ? Looks like it 's all been taken care of . Came here for nothing . - Who did this ? - They did . They all did . Don 't suppose you 've seen her around ? This one remembers its function , which all the rest have forgotten . What do you mean ? Is she alive ? Is she here ? Too late . According to my information , this was a working facility three weeks ago . Interesting . One of the vials seems to be missing . See ? Three here and one on the table . Out of five slots , yes , I know . - So , play it both ways , would you ? - Sir ? I want this place searched , the whole cave . There must be hundreds of miles of tunnels . Do it ! If Aeon Flux has that vial , we may not have come in vain . You 've been exposed , Aeon . When will you learn to take precautions ? What did you do with the vial ? - What ? - The vial from the vault . There was no vial . They were all broken . Were they ? Pity . If I had that vial , I might be able to cure you . If you had the vial , you could infect the whole world . I 'm sorry about the restraints , Aeon , but it is for your own protection . I suggest you relax and get used to it . This particular strain of the virus causes permanent insanity . But don 't worry , Aeon , I 'll take care of you , always . Naturally , I 'd prefer to be dead . Odd , the virus has never been fatal . In fact , there 's some evidence exposure actually extends life . Why , Aeon , you may have another 80 or 90 years of this . Fresh ground pepper ? Universal madness ? Is that your current project ? As usual , Aeon , you only have half the picture . The virus they were working on here does produce ... a particularly nasty psychosis , as you 're learning first-hand . The sauce is good , don 't you think ? But we believe that at one time , before the dawn of history ... a form of this virus existed in every human brain . In fact , it was an essential component of human consciousness . What it produced then was not a madness ... but a sense of connection . Of being in and of the world . But somehow , we developed an immunity . That was the fall , Aeon . Ever since , we 've been missing a part of ourselves . I think your chef uses too much tarragon . Hard to say where the mutation occurred ... in the virus or in the human mind , but if we could reverse the process ... My project is not universal madness , it 's universal happiness . Who was it you said was insane ? - I 'm sorry to interrupt , sir . - Quite all right . I 'm just doing my weekly volunteer work with the mental patients . We 've recovered two of the missing men from the cave . - Dead . - How irritating . Trevor , you have only half the picture . Thank you , Number Two . - Is this your work ? - You know nothing . Take a look at the photograph in my top . Go ahead . My pleasure . How cute . Is it yours ? One of the test subjects from the little experiment . - I came here to get her out . - A test subject . How interesting . - It 's not dead ? - Not dead . But not human . - You want a killer ? There she is . - A baby ? Poor Aeon . I keep forgetting . Still . Kiev , we 're going back into the cave , tonight . Take me ! Now ? I have more important things to do . But don 't go blowing anything up . Whatever this thing is , I need a clean blood sample . The waker sleeps . You have to tell me what happened here . Nothing happened . Nothing happens . That is the secret . Did everyone go crazy ? Or did that thing ... She 's very strong . You have to be good to her . - I bring her things . - Like me ? Listen , the others down here , the men in the yellow suits . Have you seen them ? - Take me to them . - The waker sleeps . You must do it . Or they 'll all die . They went in there ? The suits ? You wait here . Trevor ? Time ... is in our minds . Aeon . The vial . You know what to do . Why doesn 't that thing kill me ? Okay . I have to go back to where the baby is . There was a vial , a small container . - Give it to me . - You are not yet ready . Hand it over . What 's going on ? I 've died twice . Is death only a frame in time ? Or was I dead already ? She still sleeps . Fear not . The waking comes soon . Like a storm . Take me to the lab . I do love thee . To you , I deed all that I am . Why , thank you . The lab . Let 's go . My God . The baby . You have looked in the face of death but have not guessed its secret . I 'm sorry about this ... but I need to cut down the variables here . - Aeon . - Trevor ? - Trevor , you 're alive . - Of course I am . Beautiful , isn 't she ? It 's clear to me now . Madness is the way . My God , Trevor , you 've been exposed . Exposed ? Yes , exactly . Exactly ! We have to get out of here . Why , Aeon ? We were never here to begin with . We were always here ! - Trevor . - Always will be ! - I think we 've done it ! - I 'll run , you cover . - What do you take me for ? - I worshipped you , and you used me ! Why did you lie to me ? I didn 't mean to , Rorty . Aeon ? Are you all right ? - Trevor ? - I thought we 'd celebrate your cure . But if you 're not feeling up to it ... - What is this ? - I thought we had an understanding . I would give you the cure ... and you would give me what I most desire . - The vial ? - The vial ? Aeon , you ! Come now . This is what we both want . And it certainly beats a Breen prison . No ! I knew you 'd come eventually . - I never did catch your name . - I am before names . Good for you . - How long does this go on ? - Always . I 'm bored already . You were the test subject , weren 't you ? - You were the one I came here for . - No . It was her . I was here first ... before they came here with their experiments . A virus that produces human happiness . - So you killed them . - Except you . - What do you want ? - What I have always wanted . - You . - Always ? My time is not your time . So I 've noticed . Well , here I am . - You resist me . - No ! - I will have you ! - Have me . What 's the matter ? - No ! Not like this ! - Fine . No . Wait . I will show you the secret of time . Thanks , but ... To you , I bequeath . Forgive , sir , we didn 't get here in time . We got here in plenty of time . What do you mean ? The missing vial ? I don 't even know if there was a missing vial . Doesn 't matter . It 's pretty clear to me this entire experiment was a sham . Jascow was either an idiot or a charlatan . There was no virus . Sir ! The bodies ! If there was no virus , then what happened here ? I don 't know . But whatever it is had nothing to do with the work here . Just in case , we should keep the men on alert . I don 't want any casualties down here . Aeon . Turning yourself in ? You know you went to a lot of trouble for nothing down here . You don 't look so well . I know , I know . I 've been exposed . Permanent psychosis . At least the colours are nice . - What are you talking about ? - The virus . Sorry to disappoint you . There is no virus . What ? Fever . Dilated pupils . Aeon , I think what you have is the flu . Fortunately , I think you 'll find the medical facilities ... in Breen prisons quite up to date . I apologise for the bumpy ride , Aeon . - Are you feeling better ? - I don 't know . Chairman , we 're under attack ! A Monican trap . I knew it ! Not again . To you , I bequeath ... To you , I bequeath ... my inheritance . Composite things are like dreams . Fantasies , bubbles , thoughts . Like a dewdrop and a flash of lightning . A new dress and a burning tyre . - No . - Grains of sand and sinking ships . No . The shadow of a statue and an entry in a diary . A brain tumour ... No . - They are thus to be imparted . - No ! This , I bequeath to you .

 24 children have disappeared in cities where there 's a Combat 3000 , during a freak storm . Help me get my boy back , Miss Smith . What is that rain ? Insufficient data . Maybe we can get you more . Wow ! Particles identified as entanglement shells . Entanglement shells can be a by-product of trans-dimensional energy dispersal . Teleportation . What are we looking for ? Perhaps I can help . Mr Grantham , I presume . Not Mr Kudlak - I hear he stays in the shadows . I wonder where that is ! Just bring me children . Someone shows promise ! Yeah , there 's a couple of kids . One of them 's really something . What does a matter transporter look like ? It 's Luke and Clyde ! No ! Whoa ! What was all that about ? I think someone went over the top with the effects budget on this place . I feel sick . Well , do me a favour . If they hand us the trophy , don 't puke in it . I don 't like to kill unarmed women and children but , forgive me , this is war . Run ! Why are you an idiot ? ! Run ! Where now ? There must be an emergency exit . Are you all right ? UNIT training . Never forget it . Just get a little older , that 's all . This way ! Please ! Come on ! Stand back ! What about Luke and Clyde ? They 're not there , but we 'll find them ! We have to find out who we 're up against ! I want my ticket to the world championships . I thought you were getting worried . Nah , adrenaline-hype , that 's all . Look , nothing 's happened . We 're stuck in this room off the arena waiting for that Grantham guy . I don 't know , Clyde . Something 's not right . Oh , about time ! You the honour guards ? You know what , Luke , I like their style . .. Hey , what are you doing ? Get off me ! What ? Clyde ! Let me out ! What you doing ? You have compromised the mission ! What ? The woman and female child have escaped ! YOU went after them . If they got away , it 's your fault . Your security should never have allowed them access . You 're a liability to the success of this operation and to the survival of my people . You are a disgrace to your own species , Grantham . You have always sickened me . Killing you will be a service to both our worlds . No ! Please ! Please ... 'Kudlak ? What is happening ? ' The mission is compromised , Mistress . We must evacuate . 'No ! You will stay there . 'You must send me children ! More children ! ' But the security has been breached . 'Do not argue , Kudlak . ' 'I am your Mistress ! ' Yes , Mistress . Sounds like you 'll be needing me around a little bit more , Mr Kudlak . I think I know how to sort your security problem . ROAR ! Mr Smith , I need you . Luke and Clyde have been abducted by an alien . I need you to identify the species . Please describe . Humanoid . Brownish face . Kinda slimy . Wide cheekbones . No , wider . And big eyes . Yes ! I think that 's it ! Uvodni . Their home planet is in the Spiral Cluster of the Dragon Nebula , 34,000 light years from Earth . His name is Kudlak . Accessing Uvodni database . Kudlak . General Uvlavad Kudlak . One of the Uvodni Signus Brigade 's most decorated warriors . A soldier . The Uvodni were part of a planetary alliance that fought the Malakh in the Ghost Wars . Who are the Malakh ? They 'd start a war with you for looking at them . When other allies had been crushed , the Uvodni continued to fight . But why is Kudlak on Earth , abducting children ? My last data registration of General Kudlak is from a cyber-con download with a Zantoxian trade vessel that passed through the solar system two months ago . A what ? Mr Smith likes to connect with on-board computers of passing alien vessels . It pays to stay in touch . What about Kudlak ? 20 years ago , the Uvodni suffered massive casualties in a battle . Kudlak was badly injured and forced to leave the front line . It doesn 't tell us why he 's taken Luke and Clyde . Well , maybe it does . Remember what Grantham said in his office ? Children love war games . An old soldier like Kudlak wouldn 't retire . I think he 's recruiting . What ? I think he 's looking for soldiers . I 've got no signal . You ? Nothing . My battery 's dead . Oh , man . The bucket ! This is not good . I think you 're right . Did you feel it back then ? The floor was vibrating . How d 'you mean ? Very slightly . Which means ? It wasn 't doing that before . I don 't think we 're at Combat 3000 any more . I think we arrived . What are you doing ? If you 've got any idea what 's going on , I 'd love to hear it . I don 't think we got into the world championships . Who 's there ? Did you hear that ? Who is that ? Whoa ! Looks like things are finally picking up round here . What 's your name ? Jen . Who are you ? I 'm Clyde . This is Luke . Have you got a reason for sitting in a crate or are you like us , itching for a clue to what the hell 's going on ? I won Level Two at Combat 3000 . Next thing those jokers are locking me up . Clyde ? I think I 've found you that clue . Lance ! Look , I don 't want to freak you out , but your mum 's going out of her mind worrying about you . Do you have a trace on the storm , when Luke and Clyde were taken ? Yes . I have monitored weather conditions across the country . Is it possible to track the beam ? To calculate where it 's taken the boys ? Detection of this would require synchronous data-scraping in all 11 dimensions around Combat 3000 . Can you do it ? Of course . One minute . GLASS BREAKS Wait here . I know , I probably should have called you first , but ... Not at all , Mr Grantham . I 'm always delighted to study new forms of human low-life in the comfort of my own home . You are a cool old bird , I 'll give you that . Collaborating with an alien child abductor . That really is a new depth in the low-life stakes . I didn 't come here to discuss my business dealings , Miss Smith . Business dealings ? You 're helping that monster press-gang children into a war light-years away , just for money ? It 's what makes the galaxy go round . Ugh , you 're despicable . And you ... You are done for . No , Mr Grantham . I think you 're the one that 's done with ! So we all played Combat 3000 and ended up here ? And we played all over the place - London , Brighton , Manchester , Leeds and Inverness . Kids from all over the country must have been going missing . But how did we get here ? Wherever " here " is . Who are they , and what do they want with us ? I played that stupid game again and again just to get to Level Two , and I end up in a crate ! What 's going on ? BEEPING Someone 's coming . Just stick with me , OK ? I 'll look after you . Just stick with me ! I 'll look after YOU ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Where the heck are we ? Where do we go ? This way . Why this way ? Why not ? When did the moon turn blue ? That isn 't the moon ! I don 't believe it . We can 't be ! Oh , man ! We are . I never thought it would be so beautiful . Oh , we are a long way from home . They 're in space ? In Earth 's orbit . 22,000 miles over our heads . But it could be worse . How ? ! The transporter could have sent them across the galaxy to the Uvodni world . But they 're in space . It doesn 't matter whether it 's Earth 's orbit or the Planet of the Apes . Unless you 've got a friend at NASA with a shuttle , we 're stuffed - and so are Luke and Clyde . Maria , we 're going to get them back . How ? Mr Grantham is going to help us . It 's a trick . It 's got to be a trick . We didn 't fly anywhere . We were teleported . Yeah , right ( ! ) Like beam me up , Scotty . Trust me , it 's real . And that 's a real gun . Come on ! If we 're in space , how are we gonna get away ? He 's got a point . We 'll find a way . My warriors ! Such very fine warriors . What are we doing here ? What 's with this " warrior " stuff ? All we did was win a game of laser tag ! Hey , maybe that 's it ! Maybe this is just another part of the game - level three . Silence ! Behold your Mistress ! Welcome , my warriors . We 're not warriors . We 're kids . None of those before you had the initiative to escape the holding deck . None forced my return to the ship to deal with them . You are good warrior stock . This is such rubbish . You have proved yourself in the arena . You have hearts of heroes . You will not suffer our enemies to live , and we will honour your sacrifice . Hey , majesty or whatever , no offence but I think you 're getting mixed up here . Back in the arena , we were playing . And what is play if it is not a preparation for life ? Look , fight your own war . It 's got nothing to do with us . We want to go home ! Luke ! Such determination . Such loyalty to each other . You have chosen well , Kudlak . Suppose we refuse to fight . What then ? Then you will be cowards . You will not fall as heroes . But , nevertheless , you will die . That teleporter is here , and you 're going to take us to it . And then what ? Are you going to beam yourself up to the Uvodni ship and take them on with your lipstick ? You won 't be so cocky when you go down for abducting those children ! HE LAUGHS So you 're going to tell the police that I helped some butt-ugly alien send kids to war in a galaxy far , far away ? It won 't be me going down , love . It will be you , down to the funny farm . Who needs to mention aliens ? There 's evidence to link you to the disappearances . I doubt that men like you fare too well in prison . All right , all right , all right . I 'll help you out as much as I can - for all it 's worth . First thing is , it 's not Kudlak that calls all the shots . You have done well , Kudlak . The recruits have spirit . They will see it is better to fight than to die a coward 's death . How many that we have sent into battle these last years have survived , do you suppose ? We have survived , Kudlak . The Uvodni have survived . Yes , Mistress . You seem weary , General . It has been a long war , Mistress . I grow old dreaming of peace . Peace ? ! Dreams of peace are for farmers , Kudlak ! Of course , Mistress . I beg forgiveness . I am tired . We have done glorious work for our people , Kudlak . Humans are among the most aggressive species in the galaxy . Their young have untamed potential . Their imagination and adaptability have , for decades , helped our armies do glorious battle against the Malakh . Yes , Mistress . But I wonder how these battles fare . It has been so long since I 've heard from the front . Our battles are glorious , Kudlak , and one day we will crush the Malakh . And then there will be peace ? A man like you should not dream of peace , General Kudlak . Without war , the cosmos has no need of us . Prepare the recruits for transportation to the front . Yes , Mistress . My dad was a soldier . He thought there were times when you HAD to fight . Yeah . But this isn 't our fight . Can I borrow your mobile , Clyde ? We 're in space , Luke ! Who are you gonna ring ? Have you got the number for Captain Kirk ? ! Who ? Oh , just don 't break it . Whatever 's going on across the galaxy , it 's nothing to do with us . Kudlak doesn 't see it like that . Forget Kudlak . We need a plan to get out of here . What can we do ? We 're on a space ship . The only way we 'll get off is if we get sent into some alien war . Or we steal a shuttlecraft . What did you say ? I 've wired Clyde 's mobile to the ship 's computer . He did what ? Sorry . My friend 's a bit of a geek . This is a plan of the spacecraft . Just like the Isle of Wight ferry ! Yeah , that ferry ( ! ) This is where they took us to see the Mistress . And this , I 'm pretty sure , is a ... Shuttlecraft ! Genius . Yeah . Genius . He can wire your phone into an alien computer , but can you fly an alien shuttlecraft ? No . But he can wire my phone up to an alien computer . Give the boy a chance ! It doesn 't matter if he can fly it or not - we 're not going anywhere . Wanna wager ? Bet , Luke . It 's a bet . I 'll warn you again , Mr Grantham . If you don 't uphold your side of the bargain and see we reach the Uvodni ship in one piece , my friend Mr Smith has detailed files on you that will be in the hands of the police by midnight . Don 't worry , Miss Smith . I 'll get you up to the Uvodni ship . Why wouldn 't I ? You 're never going to come back . Oh , I 'll be back , Mr Grantham . I 'll be back . Not far now . What was it , first right or second right ? Second . No , first ! It was first . Whoa ! They 're over there , too . We can 't fight for them if they grease us ! Maybe we 're just too much trouble ! Oh , yeah ! We rock ! What now ? Just stay calm . I don 't want to freak you out , but I 'm losing " calm " as an option here . I never thought I would lay eyes on a sight like this again . It 's incredible . Even after everything I 've seen , I never thought I 'd see this . Maybe if everybody could see the Earth from up here , they might appreciate it more . Come on , Maria , we have to go . OK , I 've gone past " worried " , I 'm not even stopping at " anxious " . I 'm full-throttling into " panicked beyond reason " . Get a move on ! You 're enjoying this , aren 't you ? Clyde , look at this . What is the meaning of this ? Who are you ? My name is Sarah Jane Smith and I want my son back ! Clyde , look what I 've just seen in the computer banks ! Not now , Luke - later ! Clyde , look ! It 's the shuttle craft ! He made it ! Get a move on ! Warriors ! I salute you ! Yours is without doubt the finest war blood I have been honoured to gather . And now it is time to leave , to take your place on the Uvodni front line ! What do you know of my war ? I know war , any war , is no place for children . No matter how desperate your people may be . My people are not desperate ! They are proud ! They are victorious ! Victorious ? Is that what you call using somebody else 's children to fight their war ? Your species has a hunger for battle ! We don 't ! The children don 't ! We 've seen what adults have done to the world with their war and we don 't want it any more . Lies ! I 've seen your games . It 's pretend ! Can 't you understand that ? The children you sent to fight score highly in a game . It 's not the same as fighting in a battlefield . They adapt or fall . And just how victorious are your battles , Mistress ? What is the word from the front ? Mistress - your warriors are ready ! Intruders ! Execute them , Kudlak ! Mum ! And I had such hopes for you , young warrior ! No ! He 's not a warrior ! None of them are - they 're children ! War changes everything ! Stop . The war is over . What is this ? Lies ! Execute them ! I found this in your computer banks . This is trickery ! No ! Let him show you . I hacked into your ship 's computer . That 's how we escaped . I found this by accident . I will not permit this , Kudlak . Vessels of the Imperial Fleet , this is your Emperor . We have agreed an armistice with the Malakh . After all these centuries , peace at last ! Come home , all my proud warriors . Come home . We have much to rebuild . What Malakh subterfuge is this ? Luke found it in your data banks ! You have to believe it . The war is over ! According to the data , that message is 10 years old . Ten years ? ! The mistress would have told me ! We would have gone home ! This is a trick ! You wish to destroy us ! We don 't want to destroy you . No matter what your mistress has told you , Earth wants to live in peace with its neighbours . But mistress , is this true ? Is the war ended all these years ? Perhaps she doesn 't want to go home . Perhaps without a war there 's no need for her . Or for you . Mistress ? Peace does not compute . What ? Peace does not compute . P-P-Peace does n-not not compute . The mistress - she 's a computer ! She buried the message from your Emperor ! Is it true ? I am not programmed for peace . The scenario does not compute . It cannot be real ! You never expected the war to end ! Your computers were never programmed to recognise it ! Peace is an anomaly ! Without war , I cannot exist ! The point of our war was to achieve peace for our home ! We have no home . Except on the battlefield . Peace is a stranger 's land . We have no place there . You may not , but I do ! Ahhh ! All these years of peace wasted ! I thought the Malakh were my enemy , but all this time it was you ! And I will not suffer my enemies to live ! The mistress is dead . And I have committed an unforgivable crime against your world . You are free and my life is yours to take . Taking life is never the answer , General Kudlak . Whether we have been wronged by one man or a whole planet , it is always the innocents that suffer . I am not an innocent . But maybe I can find some of those that were . The ones I sent far away and that still survive . Perhaps I can return them and one day , find some peace for myself . I hope you can . General Kudlak . It is my duty . We 're leaving . Now . Not much of a hero 's welcome ! Who cares ? We 're back ! Looks like Grantham 's done a runner . I never expected him to hang around , did you ? ! He can 't get away with what he 's done ! He 's worse than Kudlak ! I don 't think Mr Grantham 's the sort to stay out of trouble . He 'll get what 's coming to him . Eventually . Yeah , OK . That was a kiss ! You saved our skin , Luke , you deserved it . In fact ... Yeah ! I thought I 'd lost you ! I 'm sorry , but I 'm back now . Where have you been ? Thank you . I bet he doesn 't tell her where he 's been . Boys never talk to their mums . Are you joking ? How many people really get to go up in space ? Like , er ... no one ! She won 't be able to shut him up . She won 't believe a word , but she won 't want him to stop ! I wonder if he 'll be a soldier like his dad ? After today , he might want to be an astronaut . The first man on Mars ! First human man on Mars , that is ! Are you all right , Luke ? Is something wrong ? No , I 'm fine . You were a hero out there . All that stuff with my mobile was brilliant ! You all needed me . I felt like I belonged . So what 's with the sponsored silence ? I 'm thinking about something else . You know you said anything I wanted to know , just ask ? Encyclopaedia Clyde-annica ! I 'm your man ! Tell me about girls ? Oh , man ! This is for you . He said give it to the person you trust the most . Who 's Andrea ? Dad , something really weird is going on . There 's this woman in Sarah Jane 's house ! Who 's Sarah Jane ? Maria , please help me ! Dad ! Get out of my house ! This isn 't your house ! Who are you ? What about Maria ? Remember ... Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd

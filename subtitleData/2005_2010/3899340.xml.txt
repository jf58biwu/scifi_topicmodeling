 Before time began , there was the Cube . We know not where it comes from , only that it holds the power to create worlds and fill them with life . That is how our race was born . For a time , we lived in harmony , but like all great power , some wanted it for good , others for evil . And so began the war , a war that ravaged our planet until it was consumed by death , and the Cube was lost to the far reaches of space . We scattered across the galaxy , hoping to find it and rebuild our home , searching every star , every world . And just when all hope seemed lost , message of a new discovery drew us to an unknown planet called Earth . But we were already too late . Oh , God , five months of this . I can 't wait to get a little taste of home . A plate of mama 's alligators étouffée . You 've been talking about barbecued ' gators and crickets for the last two weeks . I 'm never going to your mama 's house , Fig . I promise . But Bobby , Bobby , ' gators are known to have the most succulent meat . I understand . English , please . English .

Hey , any of y 'all grow some balls , come see me on the court , man . Hey , hey ! Watch this crossover , baby . Like Jordan in his prime , pushing through the front line . - Step aside , ladies . - Oh , man . What ? - Lennox ! - Hey , what are you doing ? - Water ? - Thank you . Are you gonna help me with the gear ? Colonel Sharp , we have an inbound unidentified infiltrator , 10 miles out . Unidentified aircraft , you are in restricted US military airspace . Squawk ident and proceed east out of the area . Raptors one and two , snap to heading two-five-zero to intercept . Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out , not squawking . Unidentified aircraft , we will escort you to US SOCCENT airbase . If you do not comply , we will use deadly force . Copy the bogie . Tail 4500 X-ray . Sir , says here 4500 X was shot down three months ago . - Afghanistan . - That 's got to be a mistake . - Check again , then recheck . - I did , sir . A friend of mine was on that chopper . Unidentified aircraft , we will escort you to US SOCCENT airbase . - Radar , where 's the inbound ? - Bogie 's five miles out , sir . - My wife on ? - Yes , Captain . - My ladies ! - Look . Oh , my goodness . Look at her . She 's getting so big . Look at those cheeks . I just wanna chew on them . Baby , we made a good-looking kid . I know that people say that all the time , but , wow , we made one good-Iooking kid . Nice work . She has your laugh . - She laughed ? - Her first one , yeah . You sure she didn 't just fart ? No , she 's a lady . She doesn 't know you yet , but she will . 4500 X. Something 's not right . Bogie 's on the deck . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Radar 's jammed . It 's coming from the chopper . - Will ? - Sarah ? Hey , Sarah , if you can hear me , I love you and I 'll be home soon . Hey , Sarah , if you can hear me , I love you and I 'll be home soon . - To the right . Go to the right . - Check fire . MH-53 pilot , power down now . Have your crew step out or we will kill you . Hold your fire ! Stand by to engage ! My God . They bombed the antenna farm ! We 're under attack ! Go ! Move ! Move ! It 's going after the files ! Cut the hard lines ! I need a key ! It 's locked ! Move ! Move ! Here , come here ! Come here ! Here , hide in here ! Oh , my God . Okay . No ! Oh ! What the ... Epps , let 's go ! Okay , Mr. Witwicky , you 're up . Sorry , I got a lot of stuff . Watch . Okay . For my family ... Who did ... Who did that ? People ! Responsibility . Okay . So , for my family genealogy report , I decided to do it on my great-great-grandfather , who was a famous man , Captain Archibald Witwicky . Very famous explorer . In fact , he was one of the first to explore the Arctic Circle , which is a big deal . In 1897 , he took 41 brave sailors straight into the Arctic Shelf . Move faster , men ! Move ! Chop ! Heave ! The ice is freezing faster than it 's melting ! Chop faster ! Heave , men ! Heave ! No sacrifice , no victory ! We 'll get to the Arctic Circle , lads ! So that 's the story , right ? And here we have some of the basic instruments and tools used by 19th-century seamen . This here is the quadrant , which you can get for 80 bucks . It 's all for sale , by the way . Like the sextant here . $ 50 for this , which is a bargain . These are pretty cool . These are my grandfather 's glasses . I haven 't quite gotten them appraised yet , but they 've seen many cool things . Are you going to sell me his liver ? Mr. Witwicky , this isn 't show and sell . It 's the 11th grade . I don 't think your grandfather would be particularly proud of what you 're doing . I know . I 'm sorry . I just , you know , this is all going towards my car fund . You can tell your folks . It 's on eBay . I take PayPal . Cold hard cash works , too . And the compass makes a great gift for Columbus Day . - Sam ! - Sorry . Unfortunately , my great-great-grandfather , the genius that he was , wound up going blind and crazy in a psycho ward , drawing these strange symbols and babbling on about some giant ice man that he thought he 'd discovered . Okay . Might be a pop quiz tomorrow . Might not . - Sleep in fear tonight . - Here , you want ? Here , 50 . 40 ? 30 ? - Sam ? - Yeah . Sorry , sorry . Okay . Pretty good , right ? I 'd say a solid B - . A B - ? You were hawking your great-grandfather 's crap - in my classroom . - No , kids enjoy ... - Look , can you do me a favor ? - What ? Can you look out the window for a second ? You see my father ? - He 's the guy in the green car . - Yeah . Okay , I wanna tell you about a dream . A boy 's dream . And a man 's promise to that boy . He looked at me in the eye . He said , " Son , I 'm gonna buy you a car . " But I want you to bring me $ 2,000 and three As . " Okay ? I got the 2,000 and I got two As . Okay ? Here 's the dream . Your B - . Dream gone . Kaput . Sir , just ask yourself , what would Jesus do ? Yes ! Yes , yes . So ? A - . It 's an A , though . Wait , wait , wait . I can 't see .

Get your cousin out of that damn clown suit . He 's having a heat stroke again . Scaring white folks . I 'm hot ! Makeup 's melting . It hurts my eyes . Here ? No , no , no , what is this ? You said ... You said half a car , not half a piece of crap , Dad . When I was your age , I 'd have been happy with four wheels and an engine . Okay , let me explain something to you . Okay ? - You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin ? - Yeah . Okay , that 's what this is . And this is 50-year-old virgin . - Okay . - You want me to live that life ? - No sacrifice , no victory . - Yeah , no victory . You know , I got it . - The old Witwicky motto , Dad . - Right . Gentlemen . Bobby Bolivia , like the country , except without the runs . How can I help you ? Well , my son here , looking to buy his first car . - You come to see me ? - I had to . That practically makes us family . Uncle Bobby B , baby . Uncle Bobby B. - Sam . - Sam , let me talk to you . Sam , your first enchilada of freedom awaits underneath one of those hoods .

It 's custom faded ? Well , this is your first car . I wouldn 't expect you to understand . - Five grand . - No , I 'm not paying over four . Sorry . Kid , come on , get out . Get out the car . No , no , no . You said cars pick their drivers . Well , sometimes they pick a driver with a cheap-ass father . Out the car . Now , this one here for four Gs is a beaut . There 's a Fiesta with racing stripes over there . No , I don 't want a Fiesta with racing stripes . This is a classic engine right here . I sold a car the other day ... Gee . Holy cow . - No , no , no . No worries . - You all right ? I 'll get a sledgehammer and knock this right out . Hey , hey , Manny ! Get your clown cousin and get some hammers and come bang this stuff out , baby ! ... greater than man ... That one 's my favorite , drove all the way from Alabammy . $ 4,000 . Steve . Hello , Mr. Secretary . They 're so young . They 're the top subject matter experts , sir . NSA 's recruiting right out of high school these days . Guys , that 's the Secretary of Defense . I am so underdressed . Ladies and gentlemen , the Secretary of Defense . Please be seated . I 'm John Keller . Obviously , you 're wondering why you 're here , so these are the facts . At 1900 local time yesterday , the SOCCENT Forward Operations Base in Qatar was attacked . So far as we know , there were no survivors . The objective of the attack was to hack our military network . We 're not sure exactly what they 're after , but we do know that they were cut off during the assault , which would lead us to assume that they 're going to try it again . Now , no one 's taken responsibility for the attack . And the only real lead we have so far is this sound . That 's the signal that hacked our network . NSA 's working at full capacity to analyze it and intercept further communications , but we need your help to find out who did this . Now , you 've all shown considerable ability in the area of signals analysis . We 're on a hair-trigger here , people . The President has dispatched battle groups to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea . This is as real as it 's ever gonna get . Now I 'm gonna leave you to your officer-in-charge . You 'll break up into teams and you 'll start your work . Good luck to us all . All right , Mojo . I got the car . Now I need the girl . I need money to take out the girl is what I need . Zero bids . Great . Broke . Come on , Mojo . You want your pain pills ? No . Premature . Good . What 's up ? Nothing . You know , just driving my car . Driving my car . It 's like clockwork . All right , I know you get wasted on these things , but if you piss in my bed again , you 're sleeping outside . Okay ? That 's it for today . No more . Crackhead . - Ron , this one is uneven . - Yeah . Probably . This one is wobbly . - Yeah . I 'll take care of that real soon . - Couldn 't we have hired a professional ? - Sam ... - What ? I do not like footprints on my grass . - What foot ... There 's no footprints . - That 's why I built my path . So why don 't you go from my grass onto my path , okay ? - It 's family grass , Dad . - Well , when you own your own grass , - you 'll understand . - This ... I can 't do it anymore . - You 're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog . - What ? He 's got enough self-esteem issues as a Chihuahua , Mom . That 's his bling . I want you home at 11 : 00 ! - Yeah , all right . - 11 : 00 ! Please , for the love of God , drive safely . Seat belt on ! Wow . You are so cheap . Well , it 's his first car . Supposed to be like that . At this time , we can 't confirm whether there were any survivors . Oh , my God . Our bases worldwide are , as of now , at DEFCON Delta , our highest readiness level . We 're dealing with a very effective weapons system that we have not come across before . But our prayers are with the families of the brave men and women ... Honey , Daddy 's gonna be okay . I 've never seen a weapons system like this . The thermal shows this weird aura around the exoskeleton like it 's cloaked by some kind of invisible force field . That 's impossible . There 's no such thing as invisible force fields except in , like , comic book stuff , right ? - Man , I don 't know . - What is that ? My mama , she had the gift , you know ? She saw things . I got the gene , too , and that thing that attacked us ? I got a feeling it ain 't over . How about you use those magic voodoo powers and get us the hell out of here , huh ? When I took that picture , I think it saw me . It looked right at me . All right , we got to get this thing back to the Pentagon right away . They got to know what we 're dealing with here . My radio 's fried . - I got no communication with aerial . - Hey , Mahfouz . - How far do you live from here ? - Not far . Just up that mountain . - Do they have a phone ? - Yes . All right , let 's hit it . Dude , are you sure we 're invited to this party ? Of course , Miles . It 's a lake . Public property . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , dude , Mikaela 's here . Just don 't do anything weird , all right ? - I 'm good , right ? - Yeah , you 're good . Okay . Hey , guys , check it out . Oh , hi . Hey , bro . That car . It 's nice . Hey . So , what are you guys doing here ? We 're here to climb this tree . I see that . It looks ... It looks fun . - Yeah . - You know , I thought I recognized you . You tried out for the football team last year , right ? Let 's go call your mom . Oh , no , no , that ... No . That wasn 't like a real tryout . I was researching a book I was writing . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . Yeah ? What 's it about ? Sucking at sports ? No , it 's about the link between brain damage and football . No , it 's a good book . Your friends 'll love it . You know , it 's got mazes in it and , you know , little coloring areas , sections , pop-up pictures . It 's a lot of fun . That 's funny . Okay , okay . You know what ? Stop . Hey , guys , I know of a party . Let 's go , let 's head . You got to get out of the tree right now . Get ... Just get out of the tree right now , please . What are you doing ? Did you see that dismount ? All the chicks were watching . You 're making me look like an idiot . We both looked like idiots just now . - Hey , how about you let me drive ? - Oh , no . No , no , no . This is not a toy . These 22s , I don 't want you grinding them . No . Why doesn 't my little bunny just hop in the back seat ? God , I can 't even tell you how much I 'm not your little bunny . Okay . You 'll call me . Who 's gonna drive you home , tonight ? Hey , man , what 's wrong with your radio ? - I 'm gonna drive her home tonight . - What ? She 's an evil jock concubine , man . Let her hitchhike . She lives 10 miles from here , okay ? It 's my only chance . You got to be understanding here , all right ? All right . We 'll put her in the back . I 'll be quiet . - Did you say , " Put her in the back " ? - I called shotgun . I 'm not putting her in the back . You got to get out of my car . - That 's a party foul . - What rules ? Bros before hos . Miles , I 'm begging you to get out of my car . Okay ? You can 't do this to me . You got to get out of my car right now . Who 's gonna come around when you break ? Mikaela ! It 's Sam . Witwicky . I hope I didn 't get you stranded or anything . You sure ? So , listen , I was wondering if I could ride you home . I mean , give you a ride home in my car , to your house . There you go . So ... I can 't believe that I 'm here right now . You can duck down if you want . I mean , it won 't hurt my feelings . Oh , no , no , no . I didn 't mean here with you . I just meant here , like , in this situation , this same situation that I 'm always in . 'Cause , I don 't know , I guess I just have a weakness for hot guys , for tight abs and really big arms . Big arms ? Well , there 's a couple new additions in the car . Like , I just put in that light there . And that disco ball . And so the light reflects off the disco ball . Yeah . Are you new to school this year ? It 's your first year here ? Oh , no , no . We 've been in the same school since first grade . - Really ? - Yeah . Yeah , a long time . Well , do we have any classes together ? - Yeah , yeah . - Really ? Which ? History . Language arts . Math . Science . - Sam . - Sam . Yeah . - Sam Wilkicky . - Witwicky . God , you know what ? I 'm so sorry . I just ... - No , it 's cool . - I just didn 't recognize you . Yeah , well , I mean , that 's understandable . No , no , no . No . Come on . Sorry , I 'm just working out the kinks . You know , it 's a new car . When I get that feeling I want sexual healing This radio is , like , you know ... It 's an old radio , too , so ... Sexual healing Look , this isn 't something that I , you know ... I can 't get this radio to stop . Look , I wouldn 't try this on you . 'Cause this is like a romantic thing that I 'm not trying to do . Not that you 're not worthy of trying something like this on . - No , of course not . - I 'm a friend of yours . I 'm not a romantic friend . Romantic friends do this . I mean , I 'm not that friend . I mean , we ... I could be . I feel good Just pop the hood . Stupid . Shut up , shut up , shut up . Whoa , nice headers . You 've got a high-rise double-pump carburetor . That 's pretty impressive , Sam . Double-pump ? It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster . I like to go faster . And it looks like your distributor cap 's a little loose . Yeah ? How 'd you know that ? My dad . He was a real grease monkey . He taught me all about this . I could take it all apart , clean it , put it back together . That 's weird . I just wouldn 't peg you for mechanical . Oh , my God . Well , you know , I don 't really broadcast it . Guys don 't like it when you know more about cars than they do . Especially not Trent . He hates it . Yeah , no , I 'm cool with , you know , females working on my engine . I prefer it , actually . - Okay . You want to fire it up for me ? - Oh , yeah , yeah , no problem . - Thanks . - You know , I was thinking . You know , if Trent 's such a jerk , why do you hang out with him ? You know what ? I 'm just ... I 'm gonna walk . Good luck with your car . All right . Walking 's healthy , right ? Oh , God , no , no , no , no , no , no . Come on , please . Please , you gotta work for me now . Don 't let her walk away . Come on , come on , come on . Please , please . Baby come back any kind of fool could see Hey ! There was something in everything about you Baby come back you can blame it all on me Hey ! Wait a second ! I was wrong and I just can 't live without you There it is . I had fun . So , you know , thanks for listening . - Oh , yeah , yeah . - You ... You think I 'm shallow ? I think you 're ... No , no , no . I think there 's a lot more than meets the eye with you . Okay . Yeah . All right , I 'll see you at school . All right . That 's stupid . That was a stupid line . " There 's more than meets the eye with you . " Stupid . Oh , God . Oh , my God . I love my car . Hey , guys , I think the other team figured it out . Iran . Come on , man . This is way too smart for Iranian scientists . - Think about it . - What do you think , kid ? Chinese ? No way . This is nothing like what the Chinese are using . This is Air Force One . Level of flight , level three-three-zero . We will hunt down this enemy . And when we do , we 'll know just what to do with them . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Apparently , there are very few survivors . Yes , Mr. President ? Yeah , can you wrangle me up some Ding Dongs , darling ? I joined the Air Force to bring the man Ding Dongs . I 'll be in storage . Shoot . Gross . Do you hear that ? Are you getting this ? I think they 're hacking the network again . Oh , my God . This is a direct match to the signal in Qatar . - Are you running a diagnostic ? - Should I be ? - Yes , you should . - So I am . Someone ! They 're hacking into Air Force One ! We need a senior analyst . - I think they 're planting a virus . - A virus ? - It 's streaming right now . - They are planting a virus and stealing a whole lot of data from your system at the same time . Code Red . We have a breach . Air Force One , someone onboard has breached the military network . I 'm in the cargo hold . Clear . Clear . - You got to cut the hard lines . - What ? - Whatever they want , they are getting it . - Sir ? Permission to take down the Defense Network . - Cut all server hard lines now . - Cut all server hard lines now . Someone 's tampered with the POTUS mainframe . What the ... Shots fired in the underdeck . Repeat , shots fired . Crew , prepare for emergency descent . I want our President in that bunker . And I don 't want to discuss a damn thing other till that becomes reality . That 's our first priority . That 's our only priority right now . Air Force One is on the ground . Oh , God . No , no , no , no , no , no , no ! That 's my car ! No ! No , no , no , no . Dad , call the cops ! Where you going with my car , buddy ? Where you going ? Hello ? 911 emergency ! My car has been stolen ! I 'm in pursuit ! Right ? I need all units , the whole squadron . Bring everyone ! No , don 't ask me questions , all right ? My father 's the head of the neighborhood watch ! Oh , my God . My name is Sam Witwicky . Whoever finds this , my car is alive , okay ? You saw that ? Since this is my last words on Earth , I just wanna say , Mom , Dad , I love you , and if you find Busty Beauties under my bed , it wasn 't mine . I 'm holding it for Miles . No , no , wait that ... Okay , that 's not true . It 's mine and Uncle Charles gave it to me . I 'm sorry . Mojo , I love you . No ! No ! No ! No ! Oh , my God . No , you 're a good dog ! Good dog ! Good dog ! Oh , my God .

Put your head on the hood . Whoever did this finally managed to infiltrate our defense network , which is what they tried to do in Qatar , only this time it worked . - What did they get ? - We still don 't know . - Talk to me about the virus . - It 's a Spider-bot virus . We 're not sure what it 's going to do , but it may cripple the system . - Can we stop it ? - Every time we try an antivirus , it adapts and speeds up . It 's like it 's not a virus anymore . It 's become the system . Obviously the first phase of a major attack against the US . The only countries with this kind of capability are Russia , North Korea , maybe China . - I 'm sorry , that 's not correct . - Excuse me , young lady . I didn 't see you standing there . You would be who ? I 'm just the analyst who detected the hack . Hold on . It was you ? You did it ? - Her team . - Sir , I was just trying to say , they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds . Okay . Even a supercomputer with a brute force attack would take 20 years to do that . Maybe you can explain , then , how our latest satellite imagery shows North Korea doubling its naval activity . Maybe it 's a precaution , because isn 't that what we 're doing ? The signal pattern is learning . It 's evolving on its own . And you need to move past Fourier transfers and start considering quantum mechanics . There is nothing on Earth that complex . What about an organism ? A living organism ? Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer ? - And I know that that sounds crazy ... - That 's enough . That 's enough . We have six floors of analysts working on this thing . Now , if you can find proof to back up your theory , I 'm gonna be happy to listen to you . But if you don 't get a filter on that brain-mouth thing , you 're gonna be off the team . You understand ? Look , I can 't be any clearer than how crystal clear I am being . - It just stood up . - It just stood up . Wow . That 's really neat . Okay , chiefie . Time to fill her up . And no drippy-drippy . What are you rolling ? Whippets ? Goofballs ? A little wowie sauce with the boys ? - No , I 'm not on any drugs . - What 's these ? Found it in your pocket . " Mojo .

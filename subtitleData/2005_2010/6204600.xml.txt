 Evening , little lady . Baby , we 're gonna run . Damn it . Mommy didn 't say that . It 'll fly away , baby . It 's our lucky day , baby . Here it comes . Oh ! We 've a low-pressure center backed up ... with a cold front coming across the east . And then here in the west we 've got a high-pressure ridge ... coming in with a warm front descending across the western part of the country . I always hated you could do that . I always hated that you could date two guys at the same time . Really , Liv ? What time did you wake up ? Are you okay ? - Aunt Liv , I 'm getting vaccinations . - " Vaccinations . " Come on , baby , go get dressed . They put something dead inside you . Dead . - Into your blood . Gruesome . - Ella Jae , please go get dressed . - Yes . - " Gruesome . " - Gruesome ? - That 's a good word . - Suicide on a New York subway ... - " A jabberwock 's ... " got rush hour off to a slow start . Risa Pears , a school teacher and mother of an 18-month-old daughter ... flung herself in front of a train while returning home from the circus . I want permission to go to New York to investigate a case . - What is it ? - A suicide on the subway . I read about it in the paper this morning . How exactly is this a case ? I believe that the woman may have been murdered . There may have been extraordinary circumstances . What kind of extraordinary circumstances ? I 'm listening . That 's all I 'm comfortable saying at the moment , sir . Dunham , are you all right ? For the last few weeks you 've seemed distracted , on edge . I haven 't been sleeping very well . I wouldn 't be asking if this wasn 't important . Dunham , you are a crucial part of this operation , you 're very valuable to me . Thank you . Twenty-four hours . Then I want you back on the job , head clear . Thank you . Olivia , it was a nightmare . It felt like I was really there . - No , you were asleep in your bed . - Wait a minute . Have you experienced any nausea , Agent Dunham ? Rashes ? Hair loss ? Even a strand or two on the pillow ? - No . - Any pain urinating or blood ? I don 't think you 're helping . - Is that a ... ? - Yeah , a Geiger counter . Not a rad . I thought you might have teleported to New York in your sleep and killed her . Wouldn 't that have been wondrous ? But even the most controlled matter-to-energy transmutation ... leaves behind some background radiation . - Ergo , you were not actually there . - Great , I 'm glad we got that cleared up . - Astral ... - Astrid . Projection . Spirit walk , as it were . Oh , no , no , no . You wouldn 't have had sufficient corporeal form ... - to interact with the young woman . - Here we go . Like listening to a broken record , but the lyrics keep changing . - She had a bad dream . - You know , I could smell the platform . I saw her baby staring at me . I saw her face before I saw the news . - How is that possible ? - Opium ? It wasn 't just a dream . It wasn 't . - New York it is . - New York . I love New York . We could catch a show . Pippin . Cats fit on the windowsill Children fit in the snow Walter , you 're staying here . I 'll make it up to you . Why do I feel I don 't fit in anywhere I go ? That is the Jackson 5 , right ? Hm ? Absolutely . - She said to meet her at the clock . - There she is . - You the two ? - Dunham , Bishop , FBI . You know , you shouldn 't eat those . You 're about 30 years too late on that . Can you show us where this actually happened ? Yup , let 's go . - Are we safe ? - Sorry ? FBI comes into my house , first thing I need to ask is , " Are we safe ? " I 'm not sure we 're ever really safe . We 're as safe as houses . What can you tell us about this suicide ? Just like it said in the papers : Risa Pears , 28 , decided to take a header in front of the 7 train . So , what makes you think that it was a suicide ? Security cameras got it all . I 'd like to take a look at that tape myself . All right , we 'll set you up , agent . What exactly are we looking for here ? Humor me . There 's gonna be a balloon floating on the ceiling , a red one . Her husband was away on business in Seattle , he just flew back in . He 's giving a statement down at the station . Come on , this doesn 't fit the profile . Married , a baby . You don 't take your kid to the circus ... and then give them a front-row seat to watch you kill yourself . And then there 's that . Yeah . This doesn 't make any sense . She 'd been waiting to go to the circus . I mean , she 's from here . We met in Chicago . And she kept saying that she wanted to take Lucy to the circus . Okay ? She used to sing you the song about elephants . We were happy . She wouldn 't kill herself . You gotta believe me . She would never kill herself . Agent , the surveillance you wanted is ready . Thank you . She wouldn 't do it . She just wouldn 't . Thank you . This is the digital backup . The primary drive is in evidence . Can you slow this down ? Just start at the top . Can I get a copy of this ? See , it doesn 't make any sense . I remember things from the crime scene , I remember pushing her . You know dreams aren 't always literal . Perhaps you killed this young woman in some less direct way . No , no , no . We just watched her kill herself . Perhaps you compelled her to jump using your mind . You have any reason to want her dead ? Romantic rival , perhaps ? - What ? - I didn 't even know her . - Why did you kill her ? - I don 't know . Stop . Both of you , stop . Nobody killed anybody . I 'm surprised at you , Peter . Agent Dunham is your friend , you trust her . She says she killed that girl . Are you so presumptuous to believe her ... only when she says what you want to hear ? Your mother was a bit like that . Consider this question . - What is mankind 's oldest dream ? - World peace ? Hardly . It 's a social construct imposed by an awareness or our own mortality . Should 've gone with " Great taste , less filling . " What is the greatest desire of the weak and subjugated ? Of the man whose fire is stolen by an opponent ... whose only advantage is the luck of superior size ? - We 're stealing fire ? - I think we 're cavemen in this story . Whose woman is wrenched away by brutality and force ? Sexist cavemen , at that . Simple , to kill with thought . To wish someone dead . To murder with the mind . Come on , that 's ridiculous . You 're right , I 'm sure . Unless , of course , it happens again . - I 'm sure she wants to see us ... - It 's just sometimes ... - It 's better . I know . I know . - I can 't relax . - I agree . - Yes . - I 'm glad you feel the same way . - I do . Of course , of course . Thank you very much . Yeah , that 's true . This looks good , huh ? - Why would you do that ? - What ? Honey . Do you think it 's okay to flirt with her like that ? - Honey . Honey , please . - What is it ? I 'm not young enough ? - Hon , is something wrong ? - I 'm not sexy enough ? - Why are you doing this to me ? - Relax . What is the matter with you ? - You bastard ! You cheating bastard ! - Just calm down . I can see the way you 're looking at her ! There 's nothing wrong here . Would you stop ... ? Charlie , Charlie , it 's me . There 's been a murder . I tried to kill him . Witness statements say she stabbed her husband . - Yeah , I was there . - No , you were 300 miles away . Somehow I am killing these people in my dreams . Hello , Agent Olivia Dunham . - This is Peter Bishop . - Hi . - So , what can you tell us , doctor ? - The damage was quite severe . Upper and lower intestines both shredded . She essentially gutted him . He 's gonna die . That 's why they gave her permission to be here . So your name is Mouse ? Nickname from college . I 'm quiet , I guess . Maybe just tell us what you remember . We were at dinner . Tuesdays we go out . We decided Italian . I don 't know what happened . I just ... It doesn 't make any sense . Billy 's devoted to me . Suddenly , I knew he was gonna leave me . I was convinced of it . And I got so scared . I got so angry . How could I do this ? Well , maybe you didn 't mean to hurt him . I mean , maybe somebody made you do it . - Compelled you . - Agent Dunham . Did it feel like there was someone else in your head making you stab him ? I tried to kill my husband , right ? How is this happening ? - Agent Dunham . - Oh , God . - I need to talk to you right now . - It wasn 't you . Olivia , what exactly do you think you 're doing ? I made her do it , Peter . You 're running on no sleep . And if I 'm right , caffeine pills . I faked my way through grad school , remember ? You need to calm down . You 're not thinking straight and you 're not making any sense . Peter ... what is happening to me ? Hey . - We 're closed . - FBI . Great . Fun times . What can you tell me about what happened ? I got nothing new for you , FBI . Humor me . Middle of dinner , bitch gets up and stabs her husband . - Bitch ? We got a problem here ? - Problem ? Yeah , we got a problem . People rush out in the middle of dinner , no one pays . Today I 'm out all lunch hour . Oh , yeah , also , I 'm on the cover of the Post . Who was sitting here ? This isn 't the Palm , we don 't keep a seating chart . - Who was it ? Was I there ? - Whoa ! Whoa ! - Was it me ? - Agent Dunham . Just some guy . He comes in every now and then . Blond hair , he 's got a scar on his face . - I know who that is . - What the hell is wrong with you ? Think you can do whatever you want ? Are you crazy ? I 'm gonna sue you guys . Olivia , stop . What 's going on ? The man that he described , I 've seen him before . What ? Where ? That 's a curious word . So it 's got nothing to do with going under water ? No . UNSUB stands for unidentified subject . Actually , it should more logically mean going above water . And still , no . I certainly hope we find him . - Who we looking for ? - I think it 's after this . Remarkable . This is entirely new . - What ? - You 're talking about the coffee ? Mm . Yes , what is it ? - Cinnamon ? - Yes . - Well , it 's quite good . Delightful , really . - There . - Blond hair , a scar . - And he was at both crime scenes . So he 's our link . Interesting . No , not the coffee . Although , I was wondering if we ... Walter , please . You say he was at the table where you dreamt you were sitting ... and on the platform ... - where you dreamt you were standing . - Yes . And in your dreams you got many of the actual details correct , is that right ? - Yes . - But you did not see him in your dreams . No , I didn 't . Well , perhaps that 's because you were him . As I said , dreams are not always literal . What if you weren 't dreaming about yourself ... you were dreaming about him ? Mr. UNSUB . So he 's the one that 's been doing these things to these people , not me ? Well , that 's a possible explanation . But why would I be dreaming of him ? I mean , who is he ? Government armed forces database is online . Interpol and public health systems online . We can match a partial from the restaurant ... to one off the guardrail at the subway station . Running facial-recognition software . Agents . - What precisely is going on here ? - Sir ... An UNSUB may be killing people with his thoughts ... while Olivia is watching in her dreams . Oh , and by the way , I don 't think this machine works . Agent Dunham ... We 've got a hit . Suspect 's name is Nick Lane , former address is St. Jude 's Mental Hospital . Well , I 'm not going there . I have a lawsuit from a restaurant manager in New York . I have unauthorized allocation of agency time and resources . I have access to government databases for personal use . What 's going on ? Someone 's been coming into my dreams ... and he 's either been making me kill people ... or he 's been killing people and making me watch . You know how this sounds ? These things ... These things that we see every day ... these things that we investigate ... they 're happening to me . Dunham , you understand what kind of scrutiny we 're under ? You 're under ? - If Harris weren 't in Washington ... - I know . You can 't unofficially investigate a case when you 're the subject . I am sorry . Dunham , why didn 't you come to me ? I should have . But I didn 't wanna sound crazy . So maybe ... Maybe it 's better if I take some time off . Just a few days to work this out . Maybe just , like , a short leave . I need to do this . Agent Francis , we have a status change . I 'm opening a new case . Subject 's name is Nick Lane . Agent Dunham is on point . Please give her whatever assistance she needs . Thank you . Dunham ... take care of yourself . I will . Until this year , I 'd never been to a mental hospital . Learn to like new things . Maybe I never gave it enough thought . What Walter went through . I only ever saw it from my own perspective . His being crazy was something that he did to us . To my mother and me . It wasn 't something that happened to him . Well , you were young . I 'm not young anymore . It must be a terrible thing to not be able to trust your own mind . Yeah . Hey . Are you two the federal agents ? Yes . Agent Olivia Dunham . This is Peter Bishop . Dr. Miller . Come with me . I remember Nick very well . He was already a residential patient when I arrived here ... which was about five years ago now . He had a very comprehensive insurance policy , quite old . I 've never seen one like it . - What kind ? - Military . About four months ago an attorney arrived here ... with papers saying Nick had inherited a large sum of money . They met twice more and after that Nick checked himself out . He was here voluntarily , after all . Nick was an interesting person . He had a kind of brightness to him . - Intelligent ? - Yes , quite , but not what I mean . He had an emotional brightness . If he was happy , he would light up a room . Sad , he was like a black hole that would suck you right down with him . Hyper-emotive is the clinical term . Put simply , his affect was highly infectious . - Was he dangerous ? - No . No , if anything , his ideation tended toward self-contempt ... toward the suicidal ... although he did suffer from some psychosis ... when his delusions were florid . What sort of delusions ? Typical paranoid fare . Nick was convinced he 'd been recruited as a child ... for a series of top-secret experiments . That he was being prepared to serve as a soldier ... in the coming war against denizens of a parallel universe . " There is a war coming . " Not a war of hatred and anger . A battle for survival . Many warriors of the inevitable confrontation are among us now . " Before they can be considered soldiers , they must be regarded as recruits . " It 's all right here . He might as well have the ZFT memorized . But this is a manifesto from a terrorist cell in Germany . It translates to destruction by the advancement of technology . - It 's their mission statement . - Yeah , that 's my point . You said Nick Lane 's been in the nut farm for years , right ? The records go back to the mid - ' 90s . He 's been quoting the ZFT for that long . So when did they recruit him ? - How old is he ? - What ? Nick Lane . What year was he born ? 1979 . - Where ? - Jacksonville , Florida . Aren 't you from Jacksonville ? - We need to talk to your father . - What do you think you know ? We need to talk to him now . Where 's the fire ? Always loved that expression , which is curious ... since my lab assistant was killed in a fire . What can you tell me about Cortexiphan ? Oh , that takes me back . I remember Belly whipping up a peyote mash ... Walter . Cortexiphan was a highly experimental drug . William theorized that it might enhance certain abilities in predisposed children . Let me guess . You experimented on people . Oh , no , no . Not me . William . We had quite a disagreement about it . - What abilities ? - It worked on perception . Carlos Castaneda , Aldous Huxley , Werner Heisenberg all focused ... on one single elementary truth : Perception is the key to transformation . Reality is both subjective and malleable . If you can dream a better world , you can make a better world . Or , perhaps , travel between them . What did you just say ? So if Nick Lane was treated with Cortexiphan ... he could change reality with his thoughts ? He could make somebody do something just by thinking it ? Not his thoughts . How you feel determines your view of the world . You 're saying that Cortexiphan worked on feelings ? That 's reductive , but , essentially , yes . What if Nick Lane wasn 't affecting people with his thoughts ? What if he was affecting them with his emotions ? The psychiatrists said that he was suicidal , right ? They said that his moods were contagious . What if he was on the platform because he was considering killing himself ? - Oh , my . - Look at the restaurant . All happy couples . It triggers his fear of abandonment ... and that woman caught his mood . Let 's say that Nick 's emotions are contagious . They 're like a virus . Maybe he 's even doing this unwittingly . It still doesn 't explain ... how it is that you are seeing him in your dreams . If William had followed the usual procedures ... You see , often , when we experimented on children ... Could we just stop right there and analyze that sentence for a second ? We would put them in pairs , like the buddy system in summer camp . Listen to him . He 's comparing human experimentation to summer camp . This pairing kept them from becoming frightened or feeling isolated . Sometimes an intense bond could form . A bond which could be greatly amplified ... by a drug like Cortexiphan . All right , stop it , both of you . You 're creeping me out . Olivia was never treated with Cortexiphan . Is that true , Agent Dunham ? I might have been . What ? Well , that 's good news . How is that good news , Walter ? This Nick Lane fellow of yours ... It means I may know how to find him . He 's sexually excited . His excitement has infected the dancer . She 's excited too . They 're leaving the club together . What , are you nuts , Ginger ? You 're in the middle of your shift ! What 's going on ? I 'm hypnotically stimulating REM state ... to enhance a psychic connection to Nick Lane . I 'm tuning her antenna , as it were . Olivia can feel what Nick Lane is feeling . She can see what he 's seeing . - What 's happening ? Is he hurting her ? - Oh . - Oh . - What ? - Oh . - What ? Oh , I see . He 's feeling guilt . Shame . He feels dirty . He hates himself . He wishes he was dead . The dancer ... He 's infecting her . She 's catching it . His emotions are jumping to her . How much he hates himself . The girl ... He 's infecting her . She 's dead . I killed her . No , you didn 't . You must stay under . Agent Dunham , you must try to stay under . She must try to stay under . What is going on ? Did he just kill someone ? - Did he kill that dancer ? - These are dreams . This boy is , essentially , a reverse empath . His feelings are killing people . Put simply , Agent Dunham 's mind ... is recognizing the effects of his emotions on his victims ... and translating them into images that her dreaming mind can recognize . " Put simply . " Peter . Help her . Help her calm down . Go ahead , son . Agent Dunham , where are you ? Where are you ? What can you see ? What can you see ? Agent Dunham ? Where are you ? I know where he lives . Clear . Clear . Come over here . I think you should take a look at this . The Torre Attack . Someone 's been a busy bee . Look at the dates on these papers . This guy has been collecting for years . I 've always wanted a two-headed goat . What newspaper is this ? Can I get a subscription ? - Walter . - Why now ? He was given Cortexiphan over 20 years ago , right ? Why is this just happening now ? A lawyer shows up with a magical inheritance ... and Nick Lane becomes an emotional atom bomb . Seems a little too coincidental to be coincidence , in my book . So , what are you saying ? You think he was activated ? " What was written will come to pass . " What ? It 's written on the wall over here . Got a call from a security guard downtown . Made a positive ID of Nick Lane entering a building . He 's not alone . Nick Lane may be turning into a walking epidemic . As his emotions become more intense , he may become more contagious . Great . Why can 't more angry ever translate into less dangerous ? What are we supposed to do if we find him ? If we get close to him , aren 't we gonna be infected too ? Yes , but perhaps Agent Dunham would not . - Why ? - You were also treated with Cortexiphan . It might afford you some degree of immunity from his abilities . Why do I get the feeling you 're not telling us everything ? Because I don 't know everything . - Officer , we 're with the FBI . - You don 't wanna go up there . We already sent a guy up . Now he 's on the ledge too . We don 't know what 's going on . - It 's okay , officer . - Olivia . I 'm gonna be okay . Nick ? Nick Lane ? Olive . You heard me . You heard me . You came . You were always the strong one . Whenever I got scared , you could make me feel better . Do you remember , Olive ? I 'm sorry . No , I don 't . It 's okay . I think they meant for us to forget . I just couldn 't . I did what they told us . I waited , Olive . The soldier to come is both natural and unnatural . I waited to be called up . Stay fit , stay focused , stay ready . I wore the blacks and grays . I blended in . But the call never came . It never came . And then that man with the glasses , he showed up at the hospital . He spoke all the old words . He said , " They 're coming . " He needed warriors . He said , " What was written will come to pass . " He said he knew how to wake me up . I shouldn 't have listened to him . Sometimes what we wake up , it can 't be put back to sleep . Nick , you don 't have to do this . I wanna stop hurting people . Take it . Take it . Shoot me . Please , Olive . I can 't fight this much longer . - Listen to me . Come down ... - Ah ! Thirty-eight miles ... I do hope Agent Dunham meant to do that . Shoot me , or I will jump ... and they will all jump with me . Shoot me , Olive . I have to die , or I will keep hurting people . Please . We weren 't made for this . Don 't make me take them all with me . Please . I 'm sorry . Olive . You 'll wish you had . You 'll wish you 'd killed me . Nick Lane 's parents died several years ago . Car accident . His lawyer 's identity appears falsified . We 've repeated our request to Massive Dynamic ... regarding the Cortexiphan protocols , but according to Nina Sharp ... the names of the participants were deleted from the records . And you still have no memory of the trials ? Of being treated with the drug ? - No . - But he does ? - Yes . - Why do you think that is ? I don 't know . You saved his life . He 's being kept in a drug-induced coma . - For how long ? - Indefinitely . He said , " Sometimes what we wake up can 't be put back to sleep . " I wonder if he was right . Are you all right , Dunham ? Yes . Hey . Aunt Liv , the stuff that they put in me isn 't dead anymore . It came back alive . Can that really happen ? It 's just bad dreams , baby girl . It 's just bad dreams . Come on . Oh ! You 're getting so big . I 'm gonna put you back to bed . I 'm breaking a thousand regulations by doing this . - Here 's Nick Lane 's file . - I know . I appreciate it , Charlie . Thank you . Okay . Is the incident contained ? Yes , Dr. Bell . - How bad ? - Bad . - Casualties ? - Not sure . Can 't locate Brenner . - Is she okay ? - She 's fine . - Hell , do we know what triggered it ? - Obviously , she was upset . It 's okay , it 's all right now . Nobody 's angry with you . You didn 't do anything bad . It 's all right , Olive . Everything 's going to be okay .

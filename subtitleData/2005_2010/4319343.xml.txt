 SILAS : Previously on Kings ... I came here greedy for all the trappings position could provide . Andrew ? Mmm-hmm . I thought he was ... In exile ? He was . Back tonight . And my nephew will be welcomed to table by all . Your treachery , after 30 years by my side . You lost your way . Just tell me so I know . Was it real ? You 're the only real thing I ever touched . This is our chance . AII the lights are off . Could you imagine if your father saw these ? He 'd have my head . No , he 'd have worse . Captain . Miss . DAVID : This week 's harder than the last . Which was harder than the week before . My serviceman 's been monitoring me . How much longer can we keep this up ? I just need some time . You 're not having second thoughts , are you ? But if we were honest about us , we wouldn 't need to sneak around . It 's not that easy . I made my vow . I already live with God 's disappointment . I can 't live with my father 's . Sit down . Today , I make pilgrimage . Meaningful action requires meaningful thought . Ideas born in solitude , brought to life in Shiloh . Last time I did the same , I came back with a vision for peace . Before that , with a vision for a capital in Shiloh . Who knows what I 'II come up with this time ? So , Iet 's clear the decks . ( SIGHS SOFTLY ) No , it 's still uneven . That 's right . Down on the Ieft . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Yes , that 's fine . That 's fine . Thank you , Hale . Have a good trip , sir . May you find all the inspiration you seek . You 're still not coming , Jack . Well , I tried . Queen 's order . In my absence , you inherit great responsibility . You 're man of the house . Consider it practice . Make me proud . JOSEPH : I needed to say goodbye , but you never gave me the chance . I needed you to know that , behind the lie , I see you . For who you really are . And I Iove you . And I know you love me . And I think everyone should know . No more hiding , Jack . You 're too brave to be such a coward . You deserve to be who you really are . I hope this will help . MICHELLE : Welcome home . Where 's your serviceman ? We 've got 20 minutes . I can spend five telling you how I sent him across town , or we can ... David . You 've been robbed . My camera . With the pictures of you . It 's gone . No . Hey , hey , hey . Listen . Listen . We 'II find who did this . I promise you . We 'II get it back . I promise . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) We 're going for a drive . Dress casual . Downstairs , five minutes . SILAS : Why don 't you take the wheel , David ? I need someone close to me that I can trust , and there are those who say that I should not trust you . That you want what you cannot have . I was there . That day . I saw . The butterflies . The crown of butterflies . What did that mean to you , David ? It 's hard to put in words . T ry . I grew up hearing your story . How the butterflies , they crowned your head . And you knew you were meant to be king . So , when they came to me , I knew . You knew what ? It was God . Speaking to me . A nothing farm boy . Telling me to serve my King . And nothing else ? What else could it mean ? Foot on the brake . Button to your left . ( ENGINE STARTING ) I want to show you something . David , where are you ? please call me as soon as you can . Did your men find anything ? It 's hard for them to find something when they don 't know what they 're looking for . David Shepherd 's apartment was robbed . You find who did it , you find his possessions . That 's all you need to know . At least let me use the full resources of the service . Which means Thomasina . Which means Rose , which means Silas , which means no . I 'II find it myself . David Shepherd 's apartment is active . Made to look like a robbery . An audio-monitoring device was placed in the piano . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Yeah ? Yeah . Uh-huh . So , when can I expect that ? Yeah . Right . Mmm-hmm . 3 : 30 ? In the afternoon ? You 're just now waking up ? I awoke before the sun . I had my reading to do . What are you reading ? Newspapers . Which ones ? AII of them . If I spend 14 hours a day reading , I should be done in two months . Uh ... Wait . I don 't understand . I 'm reading every newspaper printed while I was in exile . Cover to cover . So it can be as if I never left . Andrew . You 're home after a Iong time away . You have to do something . Not just read about it . Like what ? I don 't care . Think of all the things you wish you could have done when you were away . Now , you can do them . Anything you want . So long as you want something . I just want you to be proud of me . I 'II be proud of you when you make your mark , Son . Or you might as well never have come back . Yeah . Our Ministers . Men and women who command respect . Who serve with dignity . We are pleased to honor them today . ( CROWD APPLAUDING ) Ah ! Miss Ghent . I was thinking ergonomic for the King 's chair . It 's not the best for color , but function must win out some of the time , and the King 's back will thank us all . You removed me from the picture . These are matters of the court . It 's nothing personal . That mural commemorates the ministerial term which began in the fall , and you were appointed just weeks shy . I threaten you . Is that it ? I have no interest in Silas . I 've had my fill of old men . And without their money , you 'd still be dancing on poles , or stilts , or ... Whatever it was you did . I may have bought my title , but your brother bought your crown . Are we so different ? As long as I walk these halls , you 'II get no respect in this court . You accept it and you move on . People have been made disappear for less . Good day , ma 'am . May God bless you , and may God bless your Kingdom . Ma 'am . Whatever it is , it can wait . Not this . Mail for Jack . Deal with it like the rest . This one 's different . I needed you to know that , behind the lie , I see you . For who you really are . And I love you . And I know you love me . And I think everyone should know it . No more hiding , Jack . You 're too brave to be such a coward . I hate nothing more than lies . Wasted words . clouds that darken the blue sky , yet bring no relief of rain . Don 't you agree , Jack ? How did you get this ? Intercepted by Thomasina . Brought to my attention . Who else has seen it ? Well , there 's no telling . Which is why Thomasina is going to stop the mail . Ma 'am ? To be brought to me immediately , entirely , as much as needed . ( SNIFFS ) Did you know him , Jack ? Not well . I 've seen him around , but ... Well , he aims to track you down . Extort money from the Crown . Maybe I can talk to him , get him to back off . No , no . It 's impossible . He killed himself this morning . He 's dead ? Mmm . Which doesn 't help our case , should we have to make one . But not to worry . Hmm ? The truth always wins out . Just remember what the truth is . ( CHUCKLES ) Where are we ? Well , I 'm home . Daddy ! Daddy ! Seth ! My ! How you have grown , huh ? ( LAUGHS ) Puppy . Daddy . Turning into a big dog , huh ? Welcome , David . I 've heard so much about you . ( IMITATES EXPLOSION ) SILAS : You 're in for a treat tonight , David . Cassoulet . Seth , do you think David knows the secret of cassoulet ? No . No . Well , I 'm going to whisper it to you so you can tell him , okay ? ( SPUTTERING ) ( LAUGHS ) There is no secret , is there ? Huh ? No ! No ! Just a peasant dish . Simple , hearty . No pretense . We could all learn from it . ( EXHALES ) So ... My family . always in my heart when not in my eye . May the time apart enrich the time spent together . May there be enough love left over until the next time we join hands . Amen . Let 's eat . Spare some ? ( COUGHS ) What happened ? Come on . We used to tell each other everything . I used to take all your stuff . Maybe I can help . I doubt it . Maybe you can help me . You want me to help hide this thing with David . ( CHUCKLES ) Were we that obvious ? No . You hid in the shadows like the best of us . You have a talent for deceit . I was impressed . That 's why I won 't help you . Well , you want to see David suffer ? This hurts me , not him . Whatever it is , you don 't want him to see or hear or know . You can bury it . You can bury it so deep you won 't find it yourself anymore . But you 'II wish you hadn 't . You want help with things you 'II regret ? Go to your uncle . I won 't do it . SILAS : It 's nice . Hmm ? Seth has a new friend to talk to . HELEN : It must be nice for you , too . SILAS : Mmm . David Shepherd . He worships me . As he should . The royal mail was delivered already . Whose mail is this ? Shiloh 's . Queen 's orders . Today , all mail goes through her . THOMASINA : We 've isolated all mail within a six-block radius . Anything already delivered has been reclaimed . We 've already found one disc . If there 's more , we 'II discover it . Well , Iet 's make sure . Attention , please . State secrets have been compromised . Fifty thousand goes to anyone who finds a tape or disc . One hundred thousand if found today . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Let me guess . The Queen has taken away my parking privileges . The Queen was willing to pay a hundred thousand for this ? What are you willing to pay ? The funeral is about to begin . Is that what this is ? It 's an open service . AII are welcome . Joseph Michael Lasile . A man like us , beloved in the eyes of God . Challenged by the traits that God bestowed . Such a split can divide a man in two . But not Joseph . He lived as one man his whole life . Despite the inequality . Despite the hate . He took his own life not for loving wrong , but for loving too much . Some will say he died a cowardly death . But he lived a courageous life . Let 's remember that . MICHELLE : David ? Are you okay ? I 'm fine . Your father doesn 't know about us . He just wanted me to come with him . On pilgrimage ? I don 't have a Iot of time . Did you find the camera ? No . Then , I should tell your father about us now . So he hears it from me . You can 't . Wouldn 't he want you to be happy ? This isn 't the life I promised to live . You made that promise when you were just a girl . You 're not a girl anymore . Now , look ... Ready ? DAVID : So , this is why you brought me here . To garden ? Today , we plant 500 amaryllis bulbs before the first frost . Otherwise , the unplanted ones will die . We 've got to clear the weeds , uproot that tree , and turn the soil . Come on . Work to do . Do you want anything to drink ? Some water ? No , thanks . My father should be home soon . Maybe I can help . That 's okay . Okay . I lost something . What did you lose ? What would happen if you couldn 't find it ? It would be bad . For me . But really ... My parents , it would kill them . My father ... ( SIGHS ) Would you tell your father that I stopped by and that it 's important ? Of course . Ask . AII those questions you 've been saving . Ask me . I don 't need to . I don 't know what 's right , but I understand . I wish I could have this . What you have here . You can . Every day . How ? Don 't ever be a king . Then , why not stay here ? Leave Shiloh behind ? You don 't have to be King . Oh , but I do . If it 's in you to be of service to your fellow man , then you have an obligation to God to do it . Be it a policeman , a fireman , a soldier , a king ... If it 's in your DNA , the job fits . You must do it . I don 't know if there 's one thing I have to do . Can do . Lucky you . How stupid of you . To make an appearance at your own accuser 's funeral . I 'm trying to bury this story with that boy . Joseph . What ? His name was Joseph . What do I care what his name was ? He was trying to ruin you . No , he wasn 't . ( EXHALES ) He was trying to save me . Save you . From what ? From me . And I destroyed him for it . I 'm the reason he 's dead . Thomasina , out . You said he was nothing to you . ( SIGHS ) He loved me . And I Ioved him . No , you didn 't . You can 't . I Ioved him . I Ioved him . I cut him out of my heart because that 's what Dad wanted . That 's what you wanted . And now , the only person who saw me , who really saw me , and still loved me , he 's dead . Good . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) This ... This mistake of character ... This will be our secret . " Mistake of character " ? This is who I am . ( GRUNTS ) Your son . He doesn 't know about you , does he ? What happens when he grows up ? What will you tell him ? I pray every night to have that problem . Seth suffers the same condition as Michelle . Michelle was only saved when ... You know , I fear my currency with God is spent . There 's no chance for him ? His whole life is chance . I fear my blood is poisoned . Yeah ? AII my children somehow afflicted . AII but you . Me ? Give me that . I can do it . Give me that . I may be more than twice your age , but I 'II bet I can cut twice the wood . ( GRUNTS ) See ? Huh ? ( LAUGHING ) Some good blood left , huh ? Still the King . ( GROANING ) There are more of them . Though ... Those are the best , I think . How did you get these ? Turns out I 'm not the only one who wants to see you and your family suffer . Well ... They 're fake . This is fake , too ? Jack , I needed to say goodbye . ( STAMMERS ) Turn that off . ... give me a chance . T urn it off ! ( CLICKING ) I 'II take down the mural . I 'II have you restored . We 're way past murals now . These are my children . I know . I want to see you powerless , so you know how it feels , what you do to those around you . You have your way . Whatever you want , I 'II do . Choose . I 'II let you save one of them . Son or daughter . I 'II destroy video or pictures . The other , I 'm going to air . The fall of Prince or Princess . Your choice . If I become King , my first order of business is to reinstate the guillotine . Just for you , Thomasina . I give my Iife to protect this family . I expect to lose it doing the same . Why ? We 're all a bunch of conniving cowards , hording over a carcass . At your worst ? Yes . At your best , you bring heaven closer to Earth . I thought you 'd want this . It was Katrina Ghent 's copy . Set to air in a matter of hours . Your mother stopped it . Of course she did . I don 't even want to know how . I think you do . You had ammunition , and you fired your round . I don 't know who you were aiming at , but it 's my daughter you wounded . I did what you asked . placed Shepherd under surveillance . His apartment wired . His possessions await your interest . AII but his camera . Camera ? There were pictures ! Aimed to destroy a parent 's memory . When she was small , I used to paint her toenails tangerine . And now , all those memories debased because of you . I swear I had it . I came to you because I needed a job done clean . To protect my family from that farm boy . I wouldn 't do this , Rose . Then who would ? Did you know there 's a ballet in Shiloh ? And now , we have a symphony . ( CHUCKLES ) I missed a sale on sweaters , too . You opened my vault . You know , if you don 't read about things , it 's like they never happen . Andrew ... Why would you do that ? That camera had sensitive pictures . I know . You looked ? You let them go public . Why would you deliberately hurt your cousin ? You told me to . What ? You told me to do something . To make my mark . ( SIGHS ) You hate Silas . And Silas loves Michelle . I hurt Michelle to hurt Silas . I broke his favorite thing . You did that ? For me ? I Iove you . I want you to be proud of me . Come in . ( SIGHS ) ( CHUCKLES ) I used to love this color . Did you ? I 'm in trouble . And I can 't get out of it on my own . And no one else can help me . You should have thought of that during your photo shoot . With David Shepherd , I presume . You have always been my little girl , even when we both pretended you weren 't . Tomorrow , that 's over . Your pictures will be broadcast . They 'II be everywhere you turn and places you do not . And there 's nothing to be done . But you 're the Queen . Can 't you do something ? It is the Queen that is allowing it to happen . The story will dominate the news . You 'II be ridiculed by women , made fantasy by men . And while David is congratulated , you will be dragged through the mud . But when the dust settles , and memory fades , you 'II be thought of as a woman . Which is what you are . Sexual , desirable , formidable . And you 'II wield that power in ways young girls cannot . I 'II rest . Look after him for me . Bad back , I can deal with . Embarrassment ... You 've no reason to be embarrassed . Oh , yes , I have . I 'm not as young or strong as I was . Not like you . ( EXCLAIMS ) Your youth and my experience . We 'd be one perfect King . You 're the most powerful man I know . Not anymore . You are . I 've opened up my entire life to you . Why would you do that ? Sit down . ( CLEARS THROAT ) We only really know each other when we know each other 's deepest secrets . When we know what 's in each other 's hearts . I trust you with mine . I want you to trust me with yours . I do . Well , what 's in your heart , David ? What is your deepest secret ? I want to know you just as you know me . I want to forgive you just as you have forgiven me , so that nothing can come between us . I could keep nothing from my King . I believe you , my son . ( GROANS ) DAVID : The frost . Our amaryllis . They 'II die . Maybe next year . We 'II come back . AII rise . The King approaches . I trust both sun and moon rose in my absence ? Hmm ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) This was a pilgrimage like no other . Rather than envision what the country needs , I came to see what we already have . And I want to acknowledge those who might fill these seats when our hearts fail the best of us . My son , my daughter , my nephew , my friend . We have so much to Iearn from youth . Well , you 've all heard it . I wish I knew then what I know now . Well , from this day on , I say , " I wish I know now what I knew then . " Imagine . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) And I have thought long and hard about who might fill up this empty chair and serve as my advisor . When , all the time , it was quietly filled . By someone who is earnest when it is not the fashion . Who loves this country almost as much as I do . But above all , whose honesty is something I Iearned I cannot do without . I want the owner to come down now , and claim his place at my table . And for all to know . David Shepherd . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) The Crown Prince . I 've come to make a trade . My reputation for my sister 's . Air the video . Give me the camera . Nobility doesn 't suit you , Jack . I 'm the better story , and you know it . From what I heard today , David Shepherd is the better story . An even better story when those pictures come out . Ruin me , and you 'II crush my mother far worse . What if I offered you a way to save your sister and yourself ? And how many lives would I have to destroy to make that happen ? Just one . The Queen . And how would I do that ? By marrying me . I always wanted to be royalty . JACK : Well , he 's got Dad 's approval . We 'II both be on his bad side soon enough . Maybe not . Jack , where did you get this ? ( EXCLAIMS ) You saved my Iife . No . No , I didn 't . It just feels that way . The truth doesn 't get any easier to tell . It only gets harder . Until it 's gone forever . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) How was your weekend ? It was fine . And your pilgrimage ? Fine . And what 's that ? A Ione amaryllis bulb , saved from the frost . A memento of pilgrimage . So , David Shepherd , then . Shepherd . Welcome home . It 's good to be home . I 've been lying to you . For too long . And you should know the truth . About me and David . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Michelle . ( CHUCKLES ) It 's okay . We don 't have to hide anymore . I told him . I told my dad everything

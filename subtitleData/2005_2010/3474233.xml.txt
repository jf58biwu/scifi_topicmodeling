 Don 't go ! Don 't go . Don 't go . There are days when things must be right . Today things must be perfect . They come , as we speak , our enemy , and we must treat them as friends . Processional , signing , reception . Every detail has been carefully chosen , and details count . Seating charts can alter the course of delicate history , battles lost for want of a dessert spoon . We can change the world today ... so long as we provide perfection . The day 's beginning , sir . And a good day it will be . Feeling luckier already . Two inches from the King 's coffee . Mind the eaves . They 've reached Shiloh . - That one 's fine . - Fine is for every other day . - If today goes as it should ... - As it will . Some photographer 's gonna snap the picture to keep the memory of the day you made peace with the implacable , and i 'll be damned if in it your tie is just fine . They 're going to sign . You did it . - Without any reverend . - That 's right . All by yourself . You were right about Shepherd . He 's a bad omen . We have a chance at peace finally . Anything goes wrong , we could be plunged back into the black of war . Take him out . Today might not be the best time . As soon as the treaty 's signed . Use your best . Order given . Radio silent . Nervous people challenging my assumptions . Hanson , you look two steps off awful . - Treaty looks good , though . - Thank you , sir . - Pencils , Perry ? - Sharp , sir . Relations between Gath and Gilboa are historically contentious , going back to the previous century but since the end of hostilities at the front ... Sleep well ? - How was breakfast ? - Pay attention . Forward march ! Detail ... Halt ! So ... do we shake hands ? Or shall we wait till there 's something to shake over ? Good thought . Join hands over things acomplished , not intended . Two pens , one paper . We are close , gentlemen . We sign our names , we shake hands , and future ghosts know us for our contributions , not our wars . Who 's in ? Never before has so much hope pinned on one crucial moment . Mom , you made it . Come on in . They 're about to sign . Let 's just get down to veteran 's affairs and get Eli 's check - so I can get back home . - We will . You just got here . You should see this . - This is what Eli died for . - We have every indication this treaty will be treated not only as a permanent truce between the countries but as an opportunity to open up the borders to trade . We need to review the treaty first . I assure you the treaty is as we last left it , every word consistent . Just a moment . Before all that ... Where 's your captain , David Shepherd ? I 'd like to meet the man who offered the peace we accepted . - He 's not here ? - I 'm afraid not . We were of a mind to security . Entry limited to only the essential . Given the scope of the agreement , which includes ... - They 're not signing . - It was your brother 's sacrifice that got them there . Now we get to watch them squander it . You don 't have to do this , David ... staying in Shiloh . I 'm not coming home , mom . Not yet . You have your family , your press . If we are to sign , he should be here as well , don 't you think ? We 'll gladly wait . - Not certain what 's going on ... - Why aren 't they signing ? You juste a one boy What good can you do here against all that ? Conversation that Bill tried to pick up between our King and Gath premier Shaw . - Okay , it looks like ... - It 's the peace talks . They 're asking for me . I 'll be back as soon as I can . - It 's the King . - David , wait . Don 't go . I have to . Sous-titres : ( 1.00 ) Synchro : Walid20-101 Synchro : Breys Synchro : - Ori- Synchro : Guig Go away ! No . They 're not shooing ' . Thomasina 's gonna be mad . I hate when she gets mad . Five days , no break , no sleep . But he gets to lunch with the premier . You 're going to table . Five-course meal . Napkin in lap . Bread on your left . White wine , red wine , water goblet . The King always grabs the wrong glass . So if you 're sitting on his right , expect not to have one . Silverware ... Start from the outside , move in . Understand , we are far from finished . - Do nothing to screw this up . - These are volatile people . You can give them no excuse to take offense . You just keep getting into trouble . I 'm trying to memorize goblet order , and all I can think about is my mom . She 's in Shiloh today . My brother . I know some people in veteran 's affairs . Maybe I can get someone to help her , walk her through it . Don 't worry . Think you 're ready for this ? He 's ready enough . Sir , what you 've done today , getting Gath here to sign for peace , - if there 's anything I can do ... - Being king means never - sleeping through the night . - An old enemy said that before I had him executed . People ask how I cope with all the responsibilities , millions of souls relying on all the good air in my lungs . It 's an easy secret . Every day I look for signs in my life and try to read into them God 's intentions . Take a good look at your life right now , captain , and think hard . What does God want you to do today ? To shut the hell up . There 's hope yet . Premier Shaw , captain Shepherd . The hero of Gilboa , slayer of tanks . I imagined a giant . Sir . All i 've seen in my life ... I 'm not often moved . You did a rare thing . I 'm sorry , sir . You have no seat . - That 's not possible . - I 'm sorry , sir . It 's the case . - It 's the seating chart . - Then change it . Go ask the queen . The queen spoke plain . No more changes . Not invited to table ? The crown prince ? Just offering my regrets . State luncheons ... I have better things to do . David told me you were here . He wanted to be here himself , but he was called away . I 'm a friend of his . He told me why you 've come . I 'm so sorry about your son . I know the where tape can be sticky here . I just wanted to see if I could make anything easier for you . I can see why he likes you . If you really wanna help me , help me get David back home . I know you think he doesn 't belong here ... I don 't want him to leave because he doesn 't belong . I 'm scared he does . He 's my son . I knew before anyone he was born different . In the caul . Seven sons , a mother knows . This one ... you protect from what wants to happen . He has a destiny in him . People with destinies ... things don 't go well for them . They die old and unhappy or young and unfinished . Not for him . Looks to be enjoying himself . May be a partner after all . I 'm not so sure about him . I don 't think general Mallick much wants to be here . And what about you , captain ? What do you think about our treaty ? Do you believe your people are willing to accept sacrificing to their hated enemy ? I want to hear a simple soldier 's opinion . Is your country ready for peace ? To be honest , I was instructed not to speak for fear of saying something stupid and jeopardizing the treaty . It 's that important to everyone here , and it 's that important to me . My brother died , and this treaty is the only thing that can give that any meaning , so ... if it 's not too rude , I 'm , gonna follow my orders for once ... keep my mouth shut and just try to use the right glass . He 's proving useful after all . Stay the order ? When we leave , wherever he stands , he dies . Yes , sir . - That 's not going to work - It will , don 't bother . You give up , I don 't . Tha 't the difference about us . You 're scared of Thomasina , that 's the difference . Master of the birds ! Sometimes you should maybe listen to me . We 've traveled far , haven 't we ? Pretty damn , sir . You 're a hell of a commander . My father doesn 't think I represent . The old man doesn 't know a fig from a fart . We 'll be at war forever with him as king . I know it 's been hard . You 've given your bones , stopped the clock on your lives . I don 't have the power to change that , as much as I do well with it . But ... I do wield an ample slice of the treasury . Who wants to waste some money ? Private . Don 't worry about it . Heads up . For your mom . This is all wrong . Miss ... This soldier has been valiantly defending your country . Maybe you ould take him into the dressing room and make sure that fits . Soldier , you do as the nice lady says . You sell cars here ? And where does the great hero of Gilboa hail from ? I grew up on a farm near ... Port prosperity . You mean the port of sorrow . We have a different name for it . My father died defending that land . I ... try to call it by the name he did . Excuse me . Old habits . Stealing desserts . You went there to help my mom . - She called me . - I just wanted to help or say hello . Not my best idea . Everyone else in your family always sends someone than to see a fish or the mermaid . She ... she doesn 't think you 're safe in Shiloh . Yeah , she might have a point . You 're the only person I can trust , and I only ever see you in the hallway . Well , as far as I know , life happens in hallways . Not the time for that , young man . Maybe later , if we make it through the day , maybe we could ... - I don 't have an actual idea . - None need . I 'd like that . Go . I see you 're still nose-to-nose in private corners . Obviously not too private . It was nice that you took an interest in him when he was the press 's darling , but , that card 's been played . I 'm not playing card . But you should be . A boy like that , he 's ... He 's innocent now , but he 'll get a taste of manor life soon enough , and then surely he 'll start enjoying things . Desire for comfort replaces desire proper all too quickly , and the chairs here are very soft . I picked them myself . We 've hemmed and hawed enough . Let 's havet it . My wife commands an army ours wouldn 't want to face allied . There 's an inconsistency in the treaty . Water rights in the west are in your favor . This is not what we agreed . I assure you , that 's correct , amended by the percentages you requested . Your King built your country on lies like this . He won 't have us anymore . If there 's an issue , we can fix it later . You 've come all this way . Just ... words on a page . This is words that you twist to your advantage . We will not sign this ! Fix it , and we 'll be back . Wait ... you can 't . You can 't do this . Please . Please . Get off of him . The great hero 's just a child , and a stupid one at that . Cry for your brother again ... See what answer you get this time . Lay a hand on me now . I beg you , give me the reason . This is an insult . There will be no treaty . Congratulations , Shepherd . We 're going back to war . The queen was already unhappy you and the prince didn 't attend to table , and now she doesn 't know what to do about anything , being foul to everyone . And the King ? He hasn 't said a word since Gath left ... Just ... scary quiet the way he gets . They say it 's the worst day the King 's ever had . Treasury . Have them announce it now . Let 's see if we can 't make a bad day worse . You look tired , David . I keep having bad dreams . Disturbing ? No more than when I 'm awake . You 'll be fine . I really screwed up . I saw that . Not your finest hour . I always have dreams in the city . Something about Shiloh . They say that dreams are a 60th part prophecy . Here maybe even more . The key ... Read the signs . Find out what it is that they are trying to tell you . Don 't go . But I shouldn 't have come today . Maybe . Where 're you going ? Where I should have been all along . We have the response from Gath . They said they 'd reconsider leaving . They 've agreed to hold for 3 hours so we can weigh a new demand . They want an additional ten kilometers into the north and all the water rights to compensate for bad faith and personal insult . There 's nothing to be done . They never intended to sign . It 's not Shepherd 's fault . They were just looking for an excuse . If it hadn 't been one thing , it would have been another . The pattern in the rug . All to lead us on . And maybe break our hearts in the offing . Sir . This house is on fire ! Whatever it is can wait ! It 's the treasury . They 're saying it 's empty , bankrupt . I don 't understand . How ? He didn 't . It 's treason , what you 've done ! You cut your strings . You think I 'd just let you stand ? What we built over decades , all the country gone in days ? All gone because of your grudge , all gone on the day that we could have had peace ? We 'll all be stronger for it . In time . With real leadership . This country is at its best when its king listens to me . Do you hate the idea of peace or just the lost opportunity of more profit ? Or maybe you just can 't stand that someone had a thought to defy you . It doesn 't matter why I want the war to continue , only that I do . Was it that sad in here , William ? Were you that lonely I could have had any number of women sent over , and look where we are now . Go ahead . Killing me won 't change a thing . Your country dies with me . Things will change . I 'll stand , and you will watch me do it . I don 't die in a corner . I plow through or break a wall . How do you think I got to be king ? - By begging me . - We 'll see . - A car , small detail . - Countryside , sir ? - No . Gehenna . - We 're going to hell . Excuse me . I 'm sorry , but there seems to be a problem with your card . It 's been declined . My card 's linked to the royal treasury . Run it again . I did . My card 's been declined ? My card 's been decline . I hope there 's no problem with the treasury . No reason whatsoever for alarm . There 's still some time before the clock runs out , and we still remain hopeful that a settlement can be reached . I assure you that the King 's personally ... There 's no hope , is there ? My boy . - It was all my fault . - I 'm sure they 'd let you think that . They only use people like us . Look what they do . Make me wait all day just to get paid because my son died ! To hell with them , their death benefit . Why did he die unless something good happens today ? There 's no meaning in his death , no benefit . It 's just pain . Come home . Let 's have no more of it . Abedon . Vesper . He 's awake also . Bad dreams , I 'll wager . I warned you . Being king means never sleeping through the night again . It 's day . - You got the Schiller . - Working out my translation . The verse is fighting me tonight . Today . So the bad days outweigh the good . Long time takes its toll . You start to ... See things you 're ... not quite sure are there . I used to fight it . Force the distinction ... Is , isn 't . After a while , it got boring , so I just gave in . Being mad means ... You 'll never be lonely again . I don 't have that good fortune . You saw too clearly . That can 't be fun . There 's a black weight on you . - Looks like a squid over your head . - All goes well in my kingdom . Your kingdom ? It used to be half mine until Silas came and ... Took it and built his monstrosity and ... Told them all I was dead . Your people celebrated when I said so . The bloody King of Carmel , Vesper Abedon , finally falls . They melted your statue into a brick and sunk it into the sea . Shouldn 't have killed so many , maybe . I see it now . You didn 't come here today to taunt me . You want something . When I marched onto Carmel , your reserves were already empty , the money never found . Is that it ? My gold again ? You hid a nation 's material wealth in a home or in a bank . I want it today . Where is it ? 30 years , a king in a box . I haven 't told you yet . Why today ? I could kill you . You won 't kill me . I 'm the only one who ever tells you the truth . Waste of a day this turned out to be . Getting nothing ' done ! She 's alive ? - You spared her ? - She 's a grown woman now . She lives well . You waited all these years ... Till you needed somethin ' ... to show me this . And you think you have patience ? She 's not alone In the picture . There are others ? Alive ? Who else ? Please . - Please ... - The gold . No truth whatsoever to the rumeur of problem with our treasory . You are all welcome to go to your banks and check . Just a move , the gold being taken to a new location , prompting a system error . I 'm no system error ! I 'm his damn benefactor ! Where did he get that much gold ? Is all that really necessary ? This isn 't your concern . It is when it spoils my plans . - I want you to stop this stupid game . - Game ? - Your husband ... - My husband is a brat . But no more so than my brother . I can 't have you two spoiling the holidays . This thing between you ... Let 's just call it done . - He 's gone too far this time . - And I 'm sure you went too far right on back , then him again , your serve . The match has too end . No more retaliations . You take his last play on the chin . Why would I do that ? When we banished Andrew from court , we had good reason . But he could find himself invited back . Your life is too empty . It 'd be nice to have your son around again , wouldn 't you say ? Two minutes to the hour . Then they 're gone . Don 't blame David for what happened . He was only trying to help see through to your goals . People like him only make you a stronger king . Maybe you defend him too well . Don 't you start lecturing me on class distinction and social hierarchy . You yourself were scandalously poor once . I don 't care about that . I wonder how he 'd react ... if he knew about you . The story that I 'd wager good money you haven 't shared with him . I think he might surprise you . You 're gonna make me come out and say it ? Have you forgotten your vow ? I love you so much it embarrasses us both , so you know I take no joy . You once asked me ... to bear witness ... So that it ever appeared that you forget I should be there to remind you . I didn 't want the job , but I 'm doing it because you asked . And so I have . So close . ... and visiting the whole week . I just wish there was something I could tell them , - something I could do . - There 's nothing you can do . ... yet to be explained . It 's uncertain at this time , but there might be some connection between this abrupt departure and the news that the treasury was bankrupt earlier today . Stop the car . - Stop the car ! - What ? I need you to get out . - What , honey ? - I 'll explain later , okay ? - What are you doing ? - Sorry , I need the car . It 's an emergency . It 's an emergency , come on ! My cab ! That 's my cab ! Out of your car ! - Don 't move ! - Show me your hands ! - Don 't go ! Please ! - Stop , or I 'll shoot ! - Hands up ! - You have to finish this ! - That 's your message ? - Please ! You think you can make peace ? There is no peace ! There never will be until every one of you is dead , everyone you love is dead ! - Back away from him . - Back away ! - Hold your positions ! - Get down , stand down now ! - Drop your weapon ! - Stand down ! Stand down ! Why don 't we take a walk ? You want it over too . I believe that . But your generals , they won 't let you . Gath is its military , and the boy destroyed one of our tanks . They 've been shamed . What 'll it take to make them stop ? Not some petty terrace or a stretch of rock . What do you need to bring to them ? What 's the real cost of real peace ? My people have no hope for better . They see how you live , and they want it . They want this ... industry , games , cranes , Shiloh . The dream you gave them . They want my city . I 'll do you one better . I 'll give you the means to make your own . Port prosperity , a world center of trade . I took it from you and with it built Shiloh . Take it back . You build something with it for your people , not your generals . Prosperity . Or the opportunity for it . Get your generals in line . Issue peace ... Real , lasting . Six months hence , under Gath control . Your people won 't accept it . They 'll learn to . If they know the reason . If you will accept . I made an offer ... and Gath accepted . We will , in six months ' time , give over port prosperity in exchange ... for lasting peace . It will be difficult , but it 's a sacrifice we 'll be glad for ... in time . Michelle . Sir . You 've had a busy day . Sir . That 's not a very detailed account of your actions . Sir , I just knew I couldn 't let them leave . There 's an upper limit of tolerance . Are you trying to get sent home , captain ? I need to be here , sir . What you did today ... saving the treaty , making peace ... They don 't understand what you 've done for us , what you do , but I 've seen it , and I 'm in awe . You were chosen to be king for a reason . When I read the signs ... in my life ... they say that I was sent here to help you . What I can do for you ... I will . Then do that . Another matter . My daughter . Doesn 't seem very interested . Then no matter at all then . - You believe him , that he 's loyal ? - We have nothing to fear from him . He acts in our favor . And fortune clearly favors him . Some people ... make me a stronger king . Abort the operation . What ? Then get word through , now . Our man went radio silent after your order . It may be too late to stop him . - What are we gonna do ? - Get it done . - No bird 's telling me what to do . - That a grenade ? Wait ! Check fire ! Birds are gone , ma 'am .

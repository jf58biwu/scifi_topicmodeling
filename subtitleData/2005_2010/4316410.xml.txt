 I didn 't think you were coming . - What ? - Nothing . What the hell is that ? I don 't know . You okay ? Gassy ... Better everyday . - Could we take a break ? - Maybe a short one . This is Joanna , an old friend of mine . - How well do you know her ? - No , don 't even think about it . It was that obvious , eh ? Joanna and I were married for 3 years . He seems to think that we have a lot in common . Really ? I gotta go . You are gonna choose a trip to Wisconsin over more incandescent sex with me ? That was the hospital in Racine . Joanna 's in quarantine there . She 's infected with CDAD . C. Difficile , just one of a whole number of bacteria living in our intestines . Basically , your colon swells shut , eventually nothing passes through . And we found where it was hiding . In a plant , David . In the soil of a potted plant . Moms . They were sold as a local fundraiser for spina bifida research . David are you still there ? ReGenesis 3x07 One Hand Washes the Other Subtitles Team NorBAC Synchro Bbsiocnarf , Goufrach , Linwelin , Lovechange Version NoTag 1.0 I got the results back on the plants from the greenhouse . And only the mums tested positive for C. difficile . - Where did the mums come from ? - Can 't CDC or NIH deal with this ? I 'm on my way to the airport to check this out . I 'd like to know where the hell I 'm going . I 'll look into it . I thought you were on your way to Michigan . - Not anymore . - What happened ? The memorial 's a family affair . You 're not family ? Not in Joanna 's parents ' minds . Sorry , man . Where are you going ? We are going to the airport . Can 't you handle this on your own ? Yeah , I can do this on my own . I was gonna go find out about what killed Joanna . I just thought you might be interested . David , I 've got an address . You barely knew Joanna , why would you offer her a job ? I barely knew you when I offered you a job . True , but that 's not an answer . I thought we might have worked well together . I just didn 't want to see Joanna get hurt ... again . Yeah . It 's a total overreaction ! I 'm shipping $ 175 000 worth of product tomorrow . - No , you 're not , Mr. Bishop . - We believe that the soil in your potted plants and in your fields is contaminated . Bullshit ! I 'm as environmentally friendly as you can get . No chemicals . No additives . Nothing . Alright , are you putting anything new on your fields ? - Fertilizers , bulb seedlings ? - No , nothing like that . - Are any of your employees sick ? - The usual . We 're going to have to do blood tests . What about your water system ? Spring-fed irrigation . Ninety percent of the water I use goes back into the aquifer in drinkable condition . Well look , until we find out where that bacteria 's coming from , you 're shutting down , that 's all there is to it . If I don 't ship these plants in 24 hours , I 'm dead . And if you do , somebody else might be . This land has been in my family for 3 generations . And suddenly you hotshot Canadians come down here , start throwing your weight around . What the hell is this ? Actually , I 'm Mexican . You mind if we borrow one of these ? Will it get you out of here faster ? No guarantees . Hey Rachel ! Listen , I want you to look into something for me . - Hey Bob . - Yep ? I 've got some new data from Zurich on two antibiotics , vancomycin and metromidazole . Maybe they 'll be more effective on the C. difficile than the others . I just got a call from David . They 're on the farm . He 'll send back a load of samples to be PCRed . I 'll have a team ready to analyze results as soon as you get them to me . I need to do another set of kill curves on new antibiotics . - Is your containment room available ? - Be my guest . - Will you bring the Zurich data over ? - Yeah , I know , I 've got it right here . - So ? - So what ? - Milo . - He 's really nice . - Just nice ? - Gotta get these to Bob . - Hey . - Rachel ! Do you have a minute ? - Could you get that for me ? - I 'll get the door for you . - Wisconsin Health called . - Oh yeah ? Looks like the situation is stabilizing . No reports of new cases . - And the plants ? - Everything that was sold has been tracked down and destroyed . - What about the greenhouse ? - Sterilized . - Good . - Be back in a second . Let 's hope David can find the source at the farm . About us , what we 're doing , - I 'm a little concerned . - Why ? - If David finds out ... - I know . And I think Mayko 's already suspicious . Maybe we should start taking separate cars . Yeah , I think that 's a good idea . - Will you bring the Zurich data over ? - Yeah , I know , I 've got it right here . - So ? - So what ? Hi Wes . Rachel ! Hey , can you get that for me ? - I 'll get the door for you . - Thanks . Okay , so here 's the data . And we 've got another batch that 's gonna be tested later tonight . Tell them to send everything that they have and then I 'll ... Oh , my god ! Are you okay ? No , Bob ! Bob , just leave it ! Oh , great . Who the ... ? Britney ... Why would she hit the crash button ? She was trained at the government labs . They 're taught to do that . Great . Now we 're in lockdown . - Here , m-maybe I should ... - No , Bob , just leave it . - Ah , shit . - What ? What 's Bishop thinking ? Not taking us seriously ? He 's thinking profit and loss . No ? I 've spent my entire life in labs , since I was 13 . That ... has never happened before . - Don 't sweat it . It 's not a big deal . - Yes , it is a big deal , Mayko . An antibiotic resistant strain of C. difficile is killing people and because of me , we are stuck in here . It was an accident . It 's okay . I 'm not getting any better , Mayko . - What are you talking about ? - My eyes . There 's something wrong with them . Oh God , Bob . What happened ? You okay ? I 'm sorry . It was nothing . I just , I got clumsy . I talked to the safety officer . You 're stuck in here for a while . It 's C. difficile . It 's okay as long as you don 't ingest it . It 's not like we 're gonna be licking it up . We 've got a strict procedure , guys . Stupid bureaucrats . Rachel , just open the door . - I 'm sorry . - You know what , it 's alright . You guys just hang tight , okay ? When you do get out of there , come meet me in my office . We 've a lot of paperwork we have to go through . It 's fine . Come on , let 's go sit . This is where you live ? When we work this farm , yes . - Is that pump that irrigates fields ? - Yes . I 'm gonna take a look around . What 's he talking about ? There were others who got sick . They went to the clinic but never came back . - They died ? - Immigration watches the place . He won 't go . You have to help him here . My abuela says , " Thank you " . - And where is your abuela ? - Home . Mexico . So how long has your vision been degrading ? It was alright for a while . At least right after the operation . But then it started . It was sporadic . Didn 't realize how bad it was getting or ... maybe I just ignored it . What do you see ? Something like tunnel vision . - I had a teacher with tunnel vision . - Really ? If you were really careful , you could sneak out of his classroom while he was still sitting at his desk . That was cruel . I suppose . He knew you were gone . He could hear everything . I don 't want to hear , Mayko . I want to see . I know , Bob , I know . Sorry . So , how about you ? Are you okay ? I 'm getting there . It was a bit slow at first . Oh God , I can 't ... I can 't do it . Can 't do it . I 'm sorry . Just leave me ... Just leave me alone ! - Mayko ? - Yeah ? Please don 't tell anybody about my eyes . - They 're gonna find out , Bob . - I know , I just wanna tell David first . Okay . It 's okay . You got any hand sanitizer ? There 's a pit toilet back there . I 'm betting it 's the source of our C. difficile . Leaking into the ground water , then into the river ? Pumped all over the fields . How 's the father ? I think he might have the same thing as Joanna , and he may be developing toxic megacolon . Antibiotics are basically useless . Anything you can do for him ? All I can do is keep him hydrated and maybe he 'll get lucky : his immune system will fight it off . Rachel . You 're gonna get the samples by tonight , okay ? So everybody works late . PCRs ASAP . Elvia , where 's your mother ? She died last year . Sorry to hear that . My father brought me here so we can be happy . Well , you 're going to have to take charge , okay ? I want you to make sure your father does not get out of bed , that he gets lots and lots of rest . Will papa get better ? Yeah , he will , yeah . Thank you , Dr. Serrano . We think we found the source of your problem . Open pit latrine you set up for your migrant workers . I didn 't set up that shithole . They did it on their own . You 're telling me that 's what 's screwing me up ? They 're living like animals out there . Listen , pal . I didn 't invent California agriculture . For 100 years , migrant have been coming here , supporting their families , - making a decent living . - Living in squalor ! I pay the highest wage in this valley ! They 're getting sick off their own shit ! How do you sleep at night ? Listen . I support an entire village in Chiapas ! - What do you do for Mexico ? - What do I do for Mexico ? - Hey ! Take it easy ! - Don 't you talk to me about Mexico . - Those people mean nothing to you . - Calm down ! Outside ! Those people mean nothing to you . They 're farm animals to you , you piece of shit . You do not want to piss that guy off . He threatens me again , I 'll have the cops ... One of the people who died was his ex-wife . Alright ? They were very close . Shit . I 'm sorry . I don 't know . I just didn 't want to be with him anymore . - And you 've told him that . - Yeah . How does that make you feel ? It was a shitty thing to do . Why do you think that ? Because Milo helped me . 'Cause he stayed with me when I was messed up . I mean , he got me through a lot of crap . How so ? Well , I just told you , he ... He stayed with me , he ... And ... that 's how come you don 't want to be with him anymore ? No . I don 't know . God , I don 't know . I ... Fuck , I wasn 't born with a road map in my hand . I don 't know how to get from A to B like everybody else . What makes you think everyone else knows how to get from A to B ? I didn 't know my biological parents were gonna be dead before I was a month old . I didn 't know I was gonna lose my leg before I was 30 . And I didn 't know that I wasn 't ready for a relationship . But shit just happens . You think you had a relationship with Milo ? If I did , I wasn 't thinking about it . About love , you know , anything like that . What were you thinking about ? Me . That 's the thing , see , I just ... I used him . I used Milo like ointment on a cut . You know , I used him to make me better . And ... I just sort of took and I didn 't really ... I didn 't give anything back . I don 't think you really believe that . Well , I gave him the only thing I had . I told him the truth . What 's is this ? These are fluids to keep your father hydrated . That will make him better ? I hope so . Now , I 'm going to leave you more of these bags . Okay ? I 'm going to have to go back to Canada soon . So you 're goin to be in charge . You 're going to be his doctor , okay ? Okay . It 's very , very important that the doctor doesn 't catch what the patient has . You have to promise me that you 're going to wash your hands . And you 're not going to touch him , Okay ? I promise . - Hey Bob , come on in . - You wanted to see me ? We got a week 's worth of reports that we 've gotta fill out . When there 's time for that . Why don 't you have a seat ? I just wanted to check in with you . About ? Well , since the explosion , we really haven 't had a chance to talk . I wanted to make sure - that everything was fine . - Everything 's fine . Are you sure ? - Why do you ask ? - I was looking at your file . You 've never had an accident of any sort before . I 'm sorry . In the last 4 months , there 's been 5 minor occurrences . Not including today . What 's wrong , Bob ? Everything is fine , Weston . May I go now , please ? Sure . Thank you . Soil samples 18 , 19 , and 20 all have the antibiotic resistant strain ? From what your samples are showing , it 's basically everywhere on that farm . That fits nicely with our theory . They use the creek water for irrigation . It gets contaminated and sprayed over the fields . We 'll confirm that as soon as we get those latrine samples . Thanks , Rachel . So if the water tests negative then we know that no more bacteria is getting on the field . And then will the fields be better ? No , because ... the bacteria is in the soil . But I think with time , we can get rid of that too . This is the last one , 1-23 . And then will everything be okay ? You are a very positive person . Why do you say that ? Because you try to always see the good in everything . My abuela says : if you look for good , good will look for you . - I like your abuela . - But you don 't even know her . Can you give me your phone number ? You 'll call me ? Of course . To check on our patient . Punch in your number . We should go . Your father 's probably wondering when you 'll be back . - Alright . - Okay . There 's millions of migrants working on farms in this state . You can 't turn it around all by yourself . I 've seen that little girl before . What do you mean ? Everywhere you look in Mexico , there are children just like her . That want ... that deserve a better life . Don 't do this to yourself . You do your best to make the world a better place . I 've seen it . You keep this up , you 're gonna make me jump off the wagon , you know . Oh shit . Carlos ! Okay , relax . So ? Great . Thanks , Wes . Riddlemeyer intervened . No charges either side . Agreed ? So what about the others ? Let 's just call it a night , alright ? Alright . I understand you had quite the night . It was interesting . I got the test results on the latrine . And ? There 's C. difficile there - but it 's just plain old C. difficile . - Oh Fuck . It 's not antibiotic resistant ? Nope . That 's not what 's on the fields . So you 're saying we haven 't found the source . You haven 't found the source . Sorry to be the bearer of bad news . Thanks . That could be good news for Elvia and Felipe . We can start them on antibiotics . It doesn 't make any sense . What are we missing ? - It 's gotta be coming from somewhere ! - Elvia 's not answering . Okay , help me figure this out for a minute , alright ? Well , there must be another source . Two separate outbreaks ? No , that 's way too coincidental . Something happened to that bacterium once it got onto that field . It mutated ? Let 's go with that . Here 's our field . Here 's our innocent little bacterium , fresh from the crapper . Now , how did it become antibiotic resistant ? Another bacterium on the field ... with antibiotic resistant DNA . Good . So ... Our two bacteria , they hook up . A couple of drinks later , they 're practicing unsafe conjugation . Or non-conjugative . It could also be a transposable plasmid . Yeah . Point is they swap DNA . We 've been asking the wrong question the whole time . What we need to know is what that other bacterium is . You know , I 'd like to check out Felipe and Elvia , make sure everything 's okay . Go . Yeah , Bob ? David . I need all the soil samples retested . - Retested ? - Full microbiology and DNA analysis right away . Was there a problem with the other tests that I ran ? We think another bacterium other than the C. difficile might be carrying the antibiotic resistant information . I need to figure out what it is . Okay . - Something wrong , Bob ? - I 'm fine . I know you better than that . What is it ? I don 't want to talk about it . - What 's wrong , Bob ? - Nothing . You 're a terrible liar . - We gonna talk when I get back . - Alright . Wes . Yeah , it 's Carlos . Listen , I need a geoposition on a phone number . Wes , I 'm on the Coast Highway . - How far ahead of me are they ? - Okay , Carlos I 'm tracking you now . They 're about 30 kilometres ahead . You 're closing fast . - What ? - I think I found our bacteria . - Hello David . - What are we looking at ? Pseudomonas Aeruginosa . A very common bacteria found in soil everywhere . Seems to be carrying a resistance marker . There 's only one problem with that , Bob . It 'd be almost impossible to have it mate with the C. difficile . I know it 's gram negative and C. difficile is gram positive . It 's the only antibiotic resistant bacteria - you found out here ? - The only one . But I do have some good news . I checked for antibiotics as you asked . The soil was saturated in Triclocarbon . - The antimicrobial ? - Yes . It 's in everything , right ? Soaps , deodorants , toothpastes , it 's even embedded in kitchen utensils , - toys , bedding , socks ... - I get it , Bob . ... and the highest concentrations were in the farm 's compost piles . - Where did the compost come from ? - Yeah , I already have that too . It 's ... It came from a sewage plant in Orange County . So let me guess . The solid matter is separated from the waste water , turned into compost , treated for bacteria ... But not for chemicals like Triclocarbon . Great . Nice plan . All this chemical shit gets washed down the drain , ends up on a farm field , kills all the weak bacteria , leaving only the super strong . And the anti-microbial soaps are only 0.2 % more effective at killing bacteria than ordinary soap and water . Thanks , Bob . They 've turned off at Highway 53 . That 's about 6 km ahead . He 's really slowed down , Carlos . Elvia . He won 't wake . I kept trying . It 's okay . Yes , I have to report a deceased body . Side road off the Coast Highway . It was the compost ? Yeah . We think it created the antibiotic resistant bacteria . This is so fucked . I try to do the right thing . Use recycled compost . A hundred other farms doing exactly the same thing . Why me ? We don 't know yet . We 're working on it . Hand soap . Amongst other things . What now ? What do I do ? Flame-sterilize 300 acres ? Scrape off the topsoil and shoot it into space ? I wish I had an answer for you . I 'm fucked . Completely , totally fucked . Listen , you ... have crop insurance ? Not for this . Alright . Well ... I 'll talk to the EPA and I 'll put in a word for you . Maybe there 's something the Feds can do , disaster relief or something like that . I appreciate it . Just let me know if there 's anything I can do . Thanks . Be almost ... Be almost ... Be almost impossible . Pseudomonas Aeruginosa . A very common bacteria found in soil everywhere . Bob , it 'd be almost impossible to have it mate with the C. difficile . I know it 's gram negative and C. difficile is gram positive . - Electropo-what ? - Electroporation . See , the problem ... was that we had 2 bacterium that couldn 't mate , but they 'd swapped DNA . When I was standing in that field I realized , for all intents and purposes , I was standing in a huge petri dish full of bacteria . And I thought if I took that petri dish back to the lab , how would I mutate the bacteria in it ? I still don 't know what electroporation is . - Fancy way of saying lightning . - So why doesn 't he just say lightning ? The point is , we use electroporation at labs to transfer genetic information from one bacterium to another , right ? Just hit the sample with 2000 volts of electricity for a millisecond . The theory is that mother nature is doing this all the time . The Earth is struck by lightning 100 times per second . Teams of microbiologists travel the world checking sites of lightning strikes for bacterial mutations . Exactly . So , here 's your field . Bolt of lightning hits it . The charge zaps a couple of bacterium . Their cell walls break down , DNA from one leaks out and slips into another . Instant evolution . Anything can happen . And in this case , the DNA made the bacterium antibiotic resistant . - What are the odds ? - Infinitesimal . But hey , shit happens . There are up to 3 billion bacteria in 1 gram of soil and 3.6 trillion lightning strikes per year . So what do we do ? We could try to get every sewage-treatment plant in North America to screen for anti-microbials . That 'll only take about 25 years . - So there 's nothing we can do . - It 's pretty straightforward . We could stop using chemicals against simple problems . Wash your hands with soap and water . And reserve antimicrobials for clinical situations . Class dismissed . Bob . Principal 's office , please . What ? What ? What 's going on with you ? Nothing . - Everything 's fine . - Really ? Bob , have I ever lied to you ? What happened to the fighting fish ? Who ate the squeezable cheese log ? Who put the underwear in my desk drawer on my birthday ? My point is you didn 't like it , right ? Is Wes giving you shit for something ? It 's not that , David . Then what ? I had an accident . But before it something funny happened . Funny ? With my vision . That doesn 't sound very funny , Bob . No . Things went blurry . You 're alright now ? It 's not the first time , and now it 's happening more often . I 'm really scared , David . Oh , no , Bob , come on . If there 's something wrong with my eyes , I can 't do my job . And my job , this lab ... - it 's all that I have . - Okay . Listen to me . All our years together , have we ever been stumped by anything ? Miranda Virus , brown cloud over Mexico City . We figured out what toasted those scientists down in Utah pretty quick . Right . We 'll figure this one out too , okay ? First , you see your ophthalmologist , find out what 's going on . I just want you to be sure about this . I am sure . My mother has a big house , you know , a lot of people taking care of it . She 's your family . She 'd love to have you . You know , she 's lonely . My father died too . I have family . Yeah . You have a lot of family . You have your cousins , your aunties , your uncles . And of course , your abuelita . I want to be with them . Is there anything that I can do for you ? Anything that you need ? No . I just want to go home ... To Mexico . Okay . The FBI received an anonymous call . Something about a smiley face you might 've received . Something like this ? The optic nerve in both eyes is degenerating . It 's progressive and irreversible . - Okay . - Stage 2 glaucoma . I 'm going blind David , I 'm sorry . Carlos Serrano , this is Rachel 's son , Craig . - Nice to meet you . - Same . - So you 're just visiting ? - Actually in transit . Algonquin Park , I 'm studying some aggressive bear behaviour up there . - Look ! - What 's on your face man ? Those aren 't burns , are they ? Smaller blisters , black in the centre , surrounded by redness and swelling . You know what you 're describing ? Yeah , Anthrax . What the hell 's going on up here ? Terrorism ? Yeah Wes , that 's exactly what we 're talking . The forest . It 's a massive biological weapon .

 I think we 've found someone who can help us fix the past . I need you to send me back . You have a rare gift , you know . To right the wrongs of your life , undo your mistakes . You can never change the past . It 's bad , always . Everything is connected . It 's the butterfly effect . I had a friend once . She knew she was dying , but that didn 't push her off her path . Her name was Charlie . Oh , my God ! I can 't believe I left her off the list . You promised you would stay in bed . ¶ Stop the world and let me off ¶ ¶ I 'm tired of going round and round ¶ Charlie ! Cute butt , hon . ¶ So stop the world and let me off ¶ Freeze , them 's my daddy 's clothes you 're stealing . Oh , I 'm sorry , but this is a matter of life and death . Destiny has sent me here to save the life of the woman I love . Love ? There ain 't no such thing . Oh , yes , there is . My love 's name is Charlie . You 've heard the story before . Boy meets girl . Hey , anything looking good , guys ? What 's that on your jacket ? That means " I don 't belong here , " right ? Boy falls in love with girl . Perfecto . You ready for disco . Girl dies . Boy travels back through time to try to save her life . Charlie was my heart , my world . My happily ever after . I did everything I could to try and save her life . But life isn 't a fairy tale . No matter how hard I tried , the brain man , Sylar , always killed her . When she died , I lost a part of myself . My greatest failure . Now I 've come back in time to try again . To save Charlie , and this time I will defeat the brain man . What 's a brain man ? It 's okay . I will make sure he doesn 't hurt anybody . I 'm the good guy . Good guys wear white hats . Bad guys wear black hats . Do you mind ? He was wearing a black hat . Oh , boy . How 's Arnold ? Dying . It might be tonight . Sooner , I don 't know . My family is shrinking , and our graveyard 's getting bigger . We need Hiro Nakamura . You said he was on a path . And it 's a damn long walk . We need him now . It 's not going to be easy . Oh , come on , you can convince an apple that it 's an orange . I know . We need him to fix the past . It 's just--I don 't know how I 'm going to convince him . Desperate times , desperate measures . And all of that . He 's in love . Her name is Charlie . Hmm . There 's a problem . She 's dead . Three years ago . That 's not a problem . That 's a ... opportunity . There 's more . There 's a lot more . Now how are you going to get back there ? I 'll have to ask my dying friend to help me again . You can 't . We all have sacrifices to make . Desperate times , desperate measures . And all that . ¶ What you lost when you left this world ¶ ¶ This sweet old world ¶ Warm you up ? Well , if you please . Oh , nice watch . That 's a , um , Sylar field edition , right ? You know , those were modeled after the watch that allied commander John Pershing brought back from Russia after World War I. Are you a collector ? I 'm--no . No , I just--I read about him in a magazine and just remembered . Just something my brain 's been doing a lot of lately , just remembering everything . Everything . I 'm my very own Wikipedia . Okay , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 ? Martin Luther King . - 1986 ? - Elie Wiesel . What 's the most common cause of death ? Heart attacks . What 's the best thing on the menu ? Tahitian pancakes . Fruit cocktail , with coconut shavings , it 's yummy . Do you think that your genius memory is because of that blood clot in your brain ? - How did you- - ? - I have a gift too . I can see how things work ... and how to fix them if they 're broken . One look at you , it 's plain as day . Uh , I will try those Tahitian pancakes , thank you very much . Smart move , hiding like that . You , from the carnival- - Butterfly man . We need to talk , Hiro . Now ! No , that 's not what I 'm saying , Sandra . Of course I want to be there for homecoming . I don 't want to disappoint Claire , but I don 't control my work schedule . I 'll--I 'll pick up milk on the way home . And the greenies for Muggles , right . Okay . Love you . Bye . Sorry I 'm late . Traffic was actually a bitch . Homecoming , hooray ! Everything okay ? Yeah , fine . 'Cause you 're making the face . I 'm not making the face . - Yeah , you are . - I don 't make faces . Yes , you do . Every time you lie to Sandra , your eyebrows furrow , and you get this line right here . I wish that I could tell her the truth . I wish I could tell her that the reason I 'm going to miss homecoming is because I 'm trying to catch a deranged serial killer with super powers . You know what ? I 'm trying to save our daughter 's life , and I can 't even tell her . The lying sucks . It does . Especially to family , I mean , I wish I could tell my mom that I missed my nephew 's bar mitzvah because I was busy bagging a guy who can shoot fire out of his nose , - but I can 't . - So what 'd you tell her ? PMS . I don 't think that would work for me . This is nice . What is nice ? Being able to , you know , not be so guarded , not be on- - Just nice to have a friend I can talk to . Is that what this is ? Two friends talking ? What would you call it ? Flirting . It 's just been so long , you don 't recognize it . No , it 's not . We 've been having breakfast twice a week for months now , miles out of town . I mean , the pancakes are not that good . No , they 're not . You and I--we can talk about anything . It 's more than friends . And you 're such a cowboy , you 'd never admit it , so I 'm taking the initiative , and I ... booked a motel room . Crazy , right ? Or not . Yes . No , no , no , no . I will be right there . Don 't do anything until I get there . Ethan 's here with the Sylar paintings . Go . I 'll meet you at the office . Are you a time traveler too ? Are you following me ? What are you doing here , butterfly man ? The question is , what are you doing here ? I 'm here to save Charlie . And why would you be doing something like that ? You told me I could right the wrongs of my life by stepping on the right butterflies . This is the biggest . It 's Mothra . I 'm here , Hiro , to make sure you understand the magnitude of your endeavor . To protect you . This isn 't a simple spilled slushy . Look . You were on a specific path . Everyone was . Sylar and Peter and Claire . I 'm making a tremendous sacrifice to make sure you succeed , Hiro . This place is a mine field . One mistake here , and it 's kablooey , history . Awful lot of trouble for one girl . Pretty as little Susie flapjacks is , is she absolutely worth it ? Yes . Isaac ? This is Mr. Bennet , the man I told you about . This girl . The one you 've painted here . And here . And there . She 's my daughter . You 're not the only one with special abilities , Isaac . There are others . Sylar is killing them . One at a time . If you know who he is , then why can 't you stop him ? Because nobody knows what he looks like . That 's why I need your help . To do what ? You know , 14 years ago , a woman left behind a baby girl with no one to take care of her . My wife and I had been having trouble conceiving a child of our own at the time , and ... It was like ... God had reached down and given us a miracle . Isaac , this is my daughter we 're talking about . I was eavesdropping , sorry , but I- - I heard everything . I had no idea . You and I will handle this , okay ? Oh , I 'm such an ass . I 'm sorry . Look , homecoming isn 't for 37 hours . 37 hours and 17 minutes . We 're made of time . We 'll nail this guy . And this thing here--just pretend it never happened , okay ? - I 'm Haitian-ing you . - No , no . Don 't Haitian me . I don 't want to forget . Everything all right , Hiro ? Ah , A-okay , cowboy . Now why do you look like the cat who ate the canary ? I did it . No kablooey , see ? Sweet . Now I 'm beginning to understand why you 're going - to all this trouble . - Yes . I don 't want to waste another minute . You say you got all your Is crossed - and your Ts dotted ? - I 'm sorry ? Charlie ? Hiro , hey . Oh ! Hiro , what 's wrong ? Nothing 's wrong . Not anymore . You 're acting like you haven 't seen me in forever . Come on . Let 's go . Go where ? Anywhere , everywhere . Pick a place . Your trip around the world starts today . Well , I don 't have anything packed . We can buy clothes when we get there . You 're serious . I don 't want to spend one more minute apart from you . Come with me . Right now . Where are we going , Charlie ? Um ... Otsu , Japan . It 's where Takezo Kensei was born . In the Shiga prefecture , Otsu is a favorite destination for relaxing on the beaches of Lake Biwa . We can take nice long walks . The average rainfall in Otsu is 13 inches . The average temperature - is 10 degrees celsius . - Charlie ? The emperor Tenji built the Omi Otsu Palace in 672 , and the famous Haiku writer Matsuo Basho wrote that - the city smelled like fish . - Charlie ! What was I saying ? You were on autopilot , talking about Otsu . Charlie ! Oh , wait . What 's going on ? Stuporous . Decerebrate rigidity . Vegetative disturbance . I don 't understand . It 's the aneurysm . It 's rupturing . I 'm dying , Hiro . Not yet , you 're not . Your attention , please : Local bus service from Odessa to Lubbock , Plainview , Amarillo , and Dumas will be leaving in five minutes . Please have your tickets ready . You . Who are you ? I was just in a diner , and then ... What did you do to me ? What do you want ? You said you could fix things . I need you to fix Charlie . You told her you understand how to fix things that are broken . She 's dying . You 're dying first . You can 't kill me , brain man . I have something you want . Yeah , your power . How are you able to do that ? I 'm the master of time and space . But right now , I 'm freezing time . Well , that must get tiring . I can do this all day . Can you ? If you kill me , you will never learn what I know about the future . Your future . Your life and death . Now I know you 're lying . I 'm on my way to meet a very special cheerleader . Then I 'll be invincible . Immortal . Are you sure about that ? I will tell you everything I know if you help me save Charlie . You 're dying too , aren 't you ? A tumor , huh ? Well . Come on , you guys ! - Hiro ! - How is she ? Not well . Who 's he ? He 's a doctor . I 'm a doctor . We 'll help her , I swear . You can help her , right ? You saw her aneurysm . You can take it out . No problem . It 's like bailing a melon . I usually prefer a more invasive style . She dies , you die . Hiro ? If it 's my time , I 'm okay with that . Really , you don 't have to do this . No , we are meant to be together . Whatever it takes . You might want to stay still for this . Charlie ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine , he did it . Five , six , seven , eight . We are the Wildcats . We 're here to say hello , To our friends , the Roughnecks , from San Antonio . We 're psyched and we 're ready to come out on top . Don 't even try to fight it , because we can 't be stopped . Now we say in closing , the best of luck to you . The Wildcats are number one , and we 'll prove it too ! - Hey . - Hey . Everything okay ? Can 't a father go see his daughter cheer at homecoming ? You never see me cheer . I know . I hate that I might miss homecoming tomorrow . I was supposed to grab a bite to eat with the girls , but , I don 't know , we could hang if you want . I would love to hang . So everything 's okay at work ? Yeah . Why would you think something 's wrong ? I mean , do you like it ? Do you love it , selling paper ? Yeah , I like it a lot . I just--I 'm sorry , I can 't imagine you being in high school , and saying , " When I grow up I want to sell paper . " Well , no , not exactly . What did you want to do ? Tell me . Please ? I wanted to teach High School English . Shakespeare . What do you know about Shakespeare ? " Now , fair Hippolyta , our nuptial hour draws on apace ; " four happy days bring in another moon : " but , o , methinks , how slow this old moon wanes ! She lingers my desires ... " Something . Wow . What is that , Romeo and Juliet ? A Midsummer Night 's Dream . It 's all about falling in and out of love . You 're a drama geek . I think you should do it . I think you should teach . I mean , you can wait till I graduate , but I think you should . I don 't think it 's going to happen . I just think you should do what makes you happy . I am ... happy . Claire , we 're leaving . Come on ! Wow . You go . I 'll see you later . - Love you . - Love you back . - Are you sure you 're okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm telling you , I feel fine . Wow . You 're right . These are incredible . Sorry to interrupt this little Hallmark moment , but we had a deal . You tell me everything you know . Yes . I will tell you how you die . You die alone . I 'm sorry . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? It means that you will collect a lot of powers . You will kill many people . You will become strong . The strongest of them all . But in the end , it won 't make any difference . We all gather to stop you . You 're alone . No one will mourn your death . No one will shed a tear . No one . I wish I could change fate , but you must go on your path . Five , six , seven , eight . We are the Wildcats , we 're here to say hello . To our friends , the roughnecks from San Antonio . We 're psyched and we 're ready to come out ... I would love one of those . - I 'm glad you came . - I can 't do this . I just don 't think it 's smart for either one of us . - Workplace romances never are . - Please don 't do that . - Do what ? - Blame it on the job . Come on . You do that with Sandra and Claire , not me . You know how complicated it can be , you know- - I know , I 've been to the human resources training . I mean , come on . That is not this . This isn 't , " Let 's go have sex in the supply closet because we 're bored with our lives " thing . You care about me . Yes , I do . We are such good liars . We 've convinced ourselves that everything is okay , but it is not okay . Taking the long way home , you know . Having that extra beer with dinner . Don 't you want to be yourself ? Don 't we deserve a little bit of happiness ? I love my family . And as complicated as it is , as much as I lie to them , I--I still love them . And maybe one day , I can tell them the truth . I just don 't want to destroy that possibility . And that is the truth . I know . You 're a great agent . Yeah , I can bag and tag with the best of them . I 'm a regular rodeo queen . I need you , Lauren . I need your help with this Sylar mess . I need your help with Claire . Of course . Of course . And I will always be there to help you , Noah . Let 's get back to work . What 's wrong ? I don 't know , um , I kind of have a knot in my gut . Oh , then , allow me to untie it . You 're the one that put it there . Look , Hiro , I was okay with dying ... Really , I 'd accepted that , but this ... Gosh , this just feels like cheating . - No , it 's okay . - It 's not . It 's not okay . I mean , that man , Sylar . You said he 's going to kill a lot of people . I just don 't understand how you could let him do that . You 're supposed to be one of the good guys . I had to preserve the time-space continuum . But you didn 't . You changed it . You saved me . But this is our happily-ever-after . We 're going to Otsu . Yay ! Otsu ! Hiro , 300,000 people die every single day . Young , old . There are accidents , murders . Why am I any different ? Why do I get to live ? Because I love you . Then that 's just selfish . Excuse me . I , um , I found this on my desk . I guess somebody delivered it by mistake . You planning a sting at the Midland Motel ? So we 're pretending that we 've never been to the Burnt Toast Diner ? Everything okay , Bennet ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's my mistake . I , uh- - thought I saw you there . - Have a good night . - You too . This is incredible . Is everyone here like me ? Yeah . Same as me . It 's quite a family . Keep your hands to yourself . Get back to your mother . Beer , please . Root . " The course of true love never did run smooth . " Charlie . I was just so terrible to you . After everything you did , risking your life . You must think something awful of me . Oh , never . I understand what you think . That I was selfish . Well , maybe I was . But I 'm not . I know the world is a better place with you in it . Well , thank you . Thank you for saving my life . Aw , shucks , ma 'am . It was no trouble . Oh , were you crying ? No , it 's folding paper . I was trying to make a thousand origami cranes . Here , Charlie . Butterfly man . What 's going on ? I 've done something very bad , Hiro . What do you mean ? I 've taken Charlie . I had to . Had to what ? Where ? Where have you taken her ? Back to my carnival . Rather , forward to our present . Why ? Why would you do that ? To get to you . It 's all been about you , Hiro . Take me to her . Where is she ? Where is Charlie ? You 're going to have to dig deep and take control . You 're going to have to take us back- - If you ever want to see her again . You did it , Hiro . You 're gaining control back . That 's great . Well , she 's not exactly here . Charlie ? Charlie . Have you seen Charlie ? Where is Charlie ? His name was Arnold . He was a time traveler . Just like you . His body couldn 't take the strain . He had a tumor , just like you . The last thing I asked him to do was to take your Charlie and trap her ... somewhere in time . It killed him . You 're a murderer . Yeah . Tell me where Charlie is . If I told you , there would be nothing to keep you here . You manipulated me . This whole time . You left me no choice . You 've got too much of that- - What do they call that in Japan ? Honor . I respect that . I respect you . But I had to do something to get you to work for me ... to fix my past . But why me ? If you had a time traveler ... If anyone here found out about my transgressions , all the good work I 've done would unravel . You are not butterfly man . You are evil butterfly man . I am the only one who knows exactly where your sweet Charlie is . And you can save her , but only if you do exactly what I ask you to do . I got my own butterflies that need crushing . What must I do ? I made a mistake ... about eight weeks ago . Sorry . So sorry .

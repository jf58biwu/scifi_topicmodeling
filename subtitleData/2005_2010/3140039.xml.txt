 Critics Award , Dunkirk French Fries Festival Best actor , Hong Kong Chop Chop Film Festival Gold Medal for film least like " The Bear " A TICKET TO OUTER SPACE Somewhere in France in 2030 Patrick , shouldn 't you fly higher ? I know you 're a fine pilot , but still ... let 's not hit a pylon . Your mom and dad live here ? Nice grazing land ! Captain , the press conference is at 11 AM . 500 reporters from all over the world ! We 're live on CNN at 8.50PM , Paris Match is here for you . They 're printing 2 million copies . Enjoy your interview ! - Hello . - Captain . Please . Can we start ? In 2 days , the whole world will watch you . Your name will be in history books . How did it all start ? Because of this . What is it ? Heard of " A Ticket to Outer Space " ? No . It was early in the century , in 2005 . The economy wasn 't doing well . The French people felt that the government wasted money on space research . The opposition party wanted to end the whole French space program ! Then the government had an idea . Hi , I 'm Jean-Philippe , an astronaut . Wanna go to outer space ? Don 't know how ? Now , thanks to " A Ticket to Outer Space " , your dream can come true ! Hi , I 'm Michelle . He 's right . Tomorrow , in all retail outlets for 2 euros , you can buy " A Ticket to Outer Space " . Scratch ! If you find 3 shuttles ... Great ! You may be one of the 2 winners to fly with a pro crew to our orbital station ! Ready to board ? " A Ticket to Outer Space " . Just scratch ! There , Prime Minister . Tomorrow , it runs on all TV channels ! All France will flip for " A Ticket to Outer Space " . Werburger , think it 'll work ? Prime Minister , we share the same aim : to preserve our budget for space research . We want French taxpayers to plan for the future ! Right ! The only solution is to involve them ! Hence this game . They 'll love it ! Our main idea , Prime Minister , is that grassroots France , also has the right to be up there . That 's good , Werburger ! It 's fine , but count me out ! I refuse to take civilians into space ! Why , Beaulieu ? It 's vulgar marketing . Beaulieu ... I 'm sorry , sir . To ants we 're giants , but in outer space , we 're the ants . Prime Minister ! Gentlemen ! So much for " A Ticket to Outer Space " ! What do you mean ? Col. Beaulieu 's our most famous astronaut . His name made the mission popular . You don 't run a tight ship ! Sir , let the game go ahead as planned . I know Col. Beaulieu well . I know how to convince him . " A Ticket to Outer Space " is a huge undertaking . Tomorrow , 27 million tickets go on sale . Who will be the 2 heroes ? Only on the departure day will we know who the 2 lucky civilians are . This game of chance has caused such a stir that the French tenor Jean-Patrick Barbu recorded a song for the future astronauts . " They 'll be blasted in a rocket through the clouds ... " Respect your orders . All together now ... Rochette ! Professor ! Your experiments waste the Army 's money ! Colonel , some day my sheep will be soldiers . They 're notjust balls of wool . Nor are they woolly balls . Speaking of woolly balls , some men ... OK , Rochette . Move ! Hi . Welcome to Scolco Inc 's 10th birthday Cardoux , we 're proud to have you . You 're a star of corporate shows . My pleasure . - What 's Bill Gates like ? - Who ? Your resumé says you did the Microsoft convention . Oh , sure . So how is he ? He 's very ... Very good at math . I thought so . But how does he ... ? So , brief me . It 's Scolco 's 10th birthday . We 're tops in fire-extinguishers . Our whole workforce is celebrating the company spirit .

I 'll dish up something tasty . You 'll never forget this 10th birthday ! I 'm sorry . What else can I say ... I 'm sorry . I did that for Bic , the gas lighters . The fire stayed in the trash can . I was a big hit . Your extinguisher isn 't very handy ... Get out of here ! Happy birthday , anyway . Hi , I 'm Stéphane Cardoux , sorry to bother you . It 's about your film " Charlemagne vs the Ninjas " . Did I get the part ? The part of the troubadour . Really ? OK , too bad . No , it 's a shame . Because I 'd started to learn juggling . Hi , this is Claude Lelouch . What a shoot ! How did I wind up in a Greek movie ! You OK ? I hope it plays in France , so you can see it . I have a great role . I 'm a shepherd . He 's weird , he has an intricate mind . I 'll ask for a cassette . But if it 's like the Polish movie I did ... You have a message . Hi , this is Claude Lelouch .

The number Claude Lelouch left is ours . He has the same number as us ? I 'll call the phone company . Last time you pretended to be Luc Besson . Listen , Isabelle . No , I 've had enough of your lies ! What lies ? You don 't act in movies . You do corporate gigs . What ? I ate with Francis Huster 2 days ago . You 're a congenital liar ! When you sold the bike store to be an actor , I was for it . Why don 't you trust me now ? Why don 't you tell me the truth ! Shit ! Where 's the Stéphane I knew ? He 's still here , and he loves you . I 'm not sure I still love him . I need to think . I 'm leaving tomorrow with Hugo . HQ of Tickets to Outer Space " Guard " magazine Hello ?

Beaulieu . - Georges , Romain , or Christine ? - Romain . ? Pupil verification . Digital verification . Spittle verification . Testicular verification . Welcome , Col. Beaulieu . Yes , hello . Colonel ! Capt. Le Guilvinec , you look well . Thanks . Let me guess . - You went on leave to Brittany ? - You 're psychic . You haven 't aged . I was gone a week . Your house coming along ? We 're not done yet . Luckily , Tudek came to help me . - Is he your fiancé ? - No , my nephew . He has time now : his trawler broke down . So , we finished the roofing . I 'll do the floor next month , with Goulven . He 's your ... ? No , my brother-in-law . We 'd be done if JoëI hadn 't ... JoëI 's your boyfriend ? Yes ... Actually , no . We broke up . Was the NASA seminar interesting ? Yes , we agreed with Russia , America and China that walking on the sun is impossible . All that money was spent , all those men , women and animals died for nothing . The little mice , little cats ... - Yes , Captain . - Little horses ... That 's space research , it 's joys and sorrows . But it 's not a silly game for thrill-starved civilians ! You still won 't go ? I have a code of honor . If I say I won 't , I don 't ! I 'll never change my mind ! That 's you , Colonel . True to your principles . I respect you for it . But regret it . Why ? I 'm taking the civilians into space . Werburger named me mission co-pilot . Colonel , I 'm afraid I had to take a decision . I replaced you . By whom ? Col. Chaussard . Who ? Col. Chaussard ! There 's no Chaussard on the base . He doesn 't exist ? Maybe ... Let me think ... OK , you 're in command . Of the Noah mission . The 2 winners arrive tomorrow . I have to cancel Chaussard . No , he doesn 't exist . Hugo , my son , my battle . I met your mom on a Wednesday . Your premature birth was on a Wednesday . On a Wednesday , I learned that MB meant Mountain Bike . Thanks to you , last Wednesday I won a slot on the space trip . Could Wednesday be my lucky number ? That space trip is my big chance to show your mom I 'm not the lamebrain she thinks . I love you , son . And I remain , yours faithfully . Signed : Dad . PS : Don 't tell your mom about the space trip . Hello , Mr Yonis . I 'm Simon Werburger , head of the Space Center . In the name of France , I welcome you . Thanks ... Hello , Colonel Beaulieu . Good to see you again . - Have we met ? - Everyone knows you . - I saw you on TV last week . - Right . Who 's this charming soldier ? Capt. Soizic Le Guilvinec . The mission 's co-pilot . Hello . Yes ... Hi . - And professor Chor ... - Rochette . Shit ! Bye-bye perfume samples . Gift from my sis ! Doesn 't matter . Hi , Mr Cardoux . - In the name of France , welcome . - Likewise . - You 're the other winner ? - Yes . Stéphane Cardoux . I 'm easy going . You play gin ? Mr Cardoux , meet Capt. Le Guilvinec . Hi , Madame . And Colonel Beaulieu . - The shuttle 's pilot . - Good . How do I set my watch for up there ? Let 's get this clear , Cardoux . Before going " up there " , you have to take some tests . Start by passing them ! Let 's go ! Yonis : 120 / 70 . Cardoux : 170 / 20 . Sorry , pal . Name the planets of our solar system . Well ... Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , Pluto . The Moon ... The Earth ... ? The Moon ... You afraid of a void ? What should I avoid ? - No , I said " of a void . " - No , you told me to avoid ... I said : " You afraid of a void ? " Sorry ... Don 't worry , I 'm not ... voidophobic . OK . All 's fine so far . I 'm holding out . Raising my arm is tough , but you can speed it up . The gravity machine hasn 't started yet . OK ! This is a pre-flight diagram . The dark red line is the thrust , which is 25 % at takeoff . The other line is the emergency path , that I hope we won 't need ! - Any questions ? - What will we do up there ? If you pass , you 'll be on Noah 's orbital station , with Prof. Rochette . Who 's he ? The finest French veterinary geneticist . He takes animals into space to study them . We 'll be up there 15 days . There 's lots to do ! I 'm sure of that , Colonel . Yes , sea-snails do it , too ! I knew it . See you later . Later . - But Colonel ... - No , Cardoux . - May I ? - Yes . Bravo for your course on meteorites . I 'm a beginner , and I got it all . Thanks . I was torn : astronaut or Breton teacher ? I love teaching . It shows . You lined up your asparagus . How so ? - Heard of culino-psychology ? - No . People 's plates are revealing . Your hard-boiled egg is hidden under the corn . - Means you love your parents . - Yes , I do . Your broccoli is a mini Taj-Mahal . Means you don 't like harming kids . No , I don 't . That 's true . Your French fries point northwest . To Brittany ! How could you be so right ? Please , Colonel . You 're psy-culino sensitive . You learn fast . Please , give me another chance . Cardoux , you 're not up to it . You 're not made for space . I can 't risk taking you with us . Yonis will be the only civilian along . You 're made for ... OK , don 't bother . I got it . Computer synchronized with navigation device . Give me your 3 wishes : I 'll try to grant them . Change my dad back from a toad ! Show me the forest of diamonds ! Make me Princess Goldenhair ! Hold it ! You act like shit ! Like shit ! First your voice ! I told you to project your voice , dammit to hell ! Then , where 's your emotion ? You don 't believe what you 're saying ! " My kingdom for a horse ! " Is that so hard to say ? OK , some audiences won 't get it . So think of Stanislavski . And do the scene like Vitez , go on ! Sir ? Who 's Vitez ? Look , if you don 't know that ... Hugo ? You said you 'd be in outer space . It 's too hard . I can 't pass the tests . I flunked 1 rst grade once , 2nd grade twice , 3rd grade thrice ... When I tell you to study hard , trust me ! Hugo , we 're off again ! Go on ! Last summer at the pool , I was afraid to dive . You said : " Where there 's a will , there 's a way . Dive , idiot ! " And I did . I can 't understand a thing you say ! Now I 'll put some gravel in your mouths ! Let 's go ! FLUNKED ! 2998 ... 2999 ... 3000 ... - You , here ? - Let 's talk . Can 't : flight practice . - Take me along ! - Go home ! No , into space ! I have the winning ticket ! You have no right to dump me ! - Here I have every right ! - Oh , yeah ? For instance ... To park yourjet on a spot for the handicapped ? That 's a dumb question ! Gotcha , Colonel . See , you don 't have every right ! Listen ... If you dump me , I 'll tell the press you treated me like shit . You are shit ! Took me years to be an astronaut ! You want to be a hero overnight ? Not a hero . Just a man . To wow his son born prematurely on a Wednesday . My honor says you 're not coming , and you won 't ! I won 't change my mind ! I never saw anyone so motivated . Sure , he 's not very valiant . But deep down , I 'm for giving a chance to those whose love can move mountains , and sprout wings . We agree , Captain . He 's coming with us . I think he should come with us . I just said it . But it 's what I just said . Men , as you know , today the whole world is watching us . I expect the best from you . It 's not any old mission . It 's taking , for the first time , French civilians to our orbital station , but it 's also the last mission I 'll share with you . I 'm retiring at the end of the month . My wife and I are opening a mini-pony riding center . Please visit us , you 'll get a special rate . I 'm very proud to have been your leader all these years . Our team always coped with adversity . Like the time the booster engine of a Hercules 3 rocket broke off and landed on a nudist colony . But all that 's past , it 's a great day for the French space program ! Live up to it ! Have a good mission ! Mom , come look ! I 'll say it again . You 'll activate the ignition after the countdown by pressing on ... ? The rocket . No , the rocket 's over there ! On the yellow button . Know what a button is ? It 's like my belly button ! There you go . Verifying shuttle AOK . Shuttle AOK . Cross-verification shuttle AOK . Shuttle AOK . I copy you . You civilians are on a TVhook-up . Speak now , France is listening . Go ahead , Cardoux . I 'm too moved for my own words . So I 'll quote those of the great Armstrong : " To play well , you need good lungs , " but having a good trumpet helps . " Yonis . I 'm proud to be along . But I want someone to know he 's not forgotten . He 'll understand . Thanks , gentlemen . Everything fine ? Shuttle AOK ? Shuttle AOK . Countdown started . No , wait ! There 's an odd noise in the cabin . Sounds like an orc . A wounded orc . Listen . An orc ? It 's Willy ! We must save Willy ! What 's going on ? You 'll have red eyes on that one . Werburger , don 't worry . It 's just a human problem . 45 ... 44 ... 43 ... Sorry . Hi , this is Stéphane Cardoux , actor and astronaut , I 'll get back as soon as possible . BK 9 ? BK 9 ? Yes . BK 9 . 13 ... 12 ... 11 ... Ignition ! Switch to autopilot . Eject motor 1 and booster ! Cross confirmation . Lift-off successful . Shuttle AOK ! Rocket ! - Yep ... - What ? Corsica 's pretty big . That 's Africa . In Africa , the mother antelope 's task is ... OK , Rochette . Shuttle here . Approaching the orbital station . Switching to autopilot . Enrico 's taking over . Permission granted . Go ahead , Lieutenant . Hi , Enrico . Hello Captain , hello Commander and the whole crew . But it 's ... Enrico , the crooner . He 's our computer 's voice . He 's a pal of our press officer . Cute , no ? Shuttle AOK , commander . Thanks , Enrico . This way , men . Lock unlocked . Optimum pressure . 100 % oxygen . Station AOK . Door , Enrico ! Welcome to our orbital station . You did a greatjob . My heart was pounding ! Tell me ... You promise to save Willy . Sure I will . Sir , can I have a word with you ? Excuse me . I can 't find the shuttle 's navigation software . It 's gone ! Poushy ... How long have you worked here ? 3 years . - 180 Ibs . - What ? It 's the total weight of all documents you lost in 3 years . Do me a favor : for my last mission , that software ... you 'd better find it ! It 's really big ! Wait ! 4 miles of corridors , 82 rooms and 5 levels . Really ? Must cost a fortune to heat . Diesel , I hope ? You have a strange sneeze . Just like someone I knew well . Who was that ? My former partner . He was weird . A weird partner ? Yes . Enrico , door ! Wanted to be an astronaut . Life decided otherwise . Watch the step . For our first dinner , I made a surprise . - Pancakes . - I made pancakes ! Thanks for the surprise . Can I help ? No , I 'll help her peel the ham . Because I 'm really overworked . Colonel , may I ask you ... About ... You know ... - Zero gravity . - Right , zero gravity . - Why aren 't we in zero gravity ? - Yes , why ? You good at Physics ? Yeah , OK . Zero gravity is loss of the Earth 's pull , OK ? By changing and inverting the proportion of inherent pull in V3 + V4 , we get the formula P-1 = V / 5 , agreed ? Our weight equals our free-fall acceleration as in the formula V-4 + S = VT-2 , so up here we weigh the same as on earth ! Total crap ! Real astronaut My grandma 's recipe , a Breton lady who taught me her knowhow and love of good things . She still around ? Yes . Jailed for hashish dealing . - Anyway , Captain , they 're ... - The best pancakes I ate . Same here . Thanks . Professor ... What will you test on these animals ? Like on the gobbler ? Teddy ? On Earth , he can 't fly . In the space , I think he can . What 's the point ? The royal eagle is above all a fine glider , with its broad upward tilted wings and long feathers spread at the tip like fingers . As an actor , what movies do you like ? Talkies in general . What was your last movie ? " Lord Of The Rings " . I played an arms-dealer ... who dealt arms . But the role was cut . Pity . It was a tough shoot , in New Zealand ... Was New Zealand pretty ? Not bad . It 's new . Did you go to Old Zealand ? No , we had the wrong boots . Yours is a fine job , Mr Cardoux . I did some amateur acting in my youth . - What are you up to ? - Checking my voice mail . We 're in space . Put it away . I 've got a signal . My brother-in-law doctored it . He 's a tech school grad . Communication to Earth activated . Evening , everyone . I 'll read you the message of congratulations from the French President . " Bravo ... " It 's dandy . " Signed : the President of France . " Night ! See you tomorrow . Hi ! Am I intruding ? Not at all . But you scared me . Sorry , I couldn 't get to sleep . Always , your first night in space . - I wanted to ask you ... - No , I wanted to ask you ... My sausage pancake was buried under the zucchini . What does it mean ? Fully buried ? I think so . - Means you 're romantic . - Yes . Too much so . A real pushover . Gets me in trouble . Like how ? Men take advantage of me . You ? When I was 16 , I fell madly in love with a man . Took him a month to tell me he was 92 . And our love was impossible . I 've suffered too much . You understand ? Don 't worry . There was some egg yolk in your glass of water . Means you 'll find true love . Soizic , I have to ... Captain ... Go for it , Beaulieu ! From here , I control the whole station . Suppose there 's a fire , and you can 't reach this room . All the rooms have USB slots . You can control the station from any of them . But you need the password . And only Beaulieu has that . No , I know it too . I coined it . Can 't be easy to coin a password ... You just pick something simple . Like what , in this case ? I can 't tell you . It 's totally forbidden . Captain ... Soizic ... I was going to ask you after the trip , but I 'm hasty . What I wanted to ask ... Hi , Colonel . What are you doing here ? What did you want to ask ? Just ... Will you make more pancakes ? Sure I will . Yonis , go back to your cabin . You don 't belong here ! Evening , Soizic ... Colonel . Captain , verify all the parameters of AOK shuttle ! All of them ? All of them . That 's an order ! Access Code Sugar pancakes . Access denied Jam pancakes . Access denied Chocolate pancakes . Access denied Toothpaste pancakes . Access denied I can 't tell you . It 's totally forbidden . Totally forbidden . Access granted Changing orbital position . Changing orbital position . Race you to the shower ! Enrico , what 's going on ? If I knew , I 'd tell you , Colonel . - Captain ? - I can 't switch to manual ! Enrico , switch off the automatic pilot ! Impossible . Shuttle control transferred to unknown station . Captain , call the base ! Orbital station control unit ! Shuttle all fouled up ! Try the emergency frequency ! Help ! No answer . I 'm busy . One second . I 'm coming . What is it ? There 's a problem with the station . Poushy ! You ? You ? Dunno ... We can 't make contact with them . I get a message : " Station all fouled up " ! Me too ! My calculations say it 's positioned over France . What ? This isn 't my doing ! Alexander has vanished . Who ? Mr Yonis . I offended him . He must be sulking . For unexplained reasons , the orbital station has moved . We 've lost contact with the Earth . But I 'm in control . I doubt it , Colonel . I control the station now . Can he do that ? This is for the government and our crew . Col. Beaulieu , my name isn 't Alexander Yonis . Guerin ! Fantomas ! My real name is Alexander Guerin . I said we 'd meet again . Colonel , sir ! November 18 , 1983 - Bless you . - Thanks . - You flew fast today . - Thanks for the tape gizmo . - The what ? - The Walkman . My chick got it in Japan . It 's great ! You can walk around with music ! You have a white hair . And I 'm only 21 , I don 't get it . In a week , we 'll be the first 2 French astronauts . You realize , my boyhood dream ! Wejust heard they arrested the serial killer who terrorized the city of Rosny for 3 months . His name is Bernard Guerin . He 's accused of killing over 543 people . He followed his victims on the freeway , killed them , then dressed them in the clothes of his previous victim . That 's why he was called the Freeway Interchange . Sports now , with some surfing news ... - You can 't do that ! - I have every right ! Sit down ! Your brother 's arrest is a problem , Alexander . It may affect your psychological balance . I deserve to be an astronaut . It 's my lifelong dream ! Ask Beaulieu , he trained me . Romain ! I don 't know what to say . Your brother 's Public Enemy n : 1 . Our 1st astronaut can 't be a madman 's kin . My brother isn 't mad . He 's different , he 's edgy . Who knows , some day , out of love for him , you may divert a rocket , to free him ? Sir , if I may say so , you 're too imaginative . Alexander 's a nice kid . I 'll decide that ! Guerin , you won 't go to outer space . But considering your service ... Record ? Record , thanks . You can stay on as a clerk in the Veterans ' Administration . With your pay and meal vouchers . No , Alexander . I decide ! You destroyed my life . You , Beaulieu , didn 't back me up . Now , I 'm holding the cards . Listen to me ! My brother 's in a maximum security jail in Nevers . Free him ! I want to speak to him , or this station will crash . You have 1 hour to reach him ! Poushy . Call the President ! Colonel , it 's just a test , right ? Find him , tell him he 's not nice , that you 're sorry . We 'll play gin , have lunch , and relax . The station 's huge , we won 't find him in 1 hr . I 'm sure we can parley . He 's a sensitive kid . Shut up , you crazy dyke ! I 'm sorry . Enrico , download a map of the station . Yes , Commander . It 's OK . They 're going to free him . They 're going to free him , it 's OK . Wait , look ! Neutralizing the energy stations in sections A , B and C , lowers the sequential fields , restoring control ... OK , Rochette . Wait , look ! Neutralizing the energy stations in sections A , B and C , lowers the sequential fields , restoring control . Well , Captain ? A very good idea , Colonel . What , Rochette ? Think I 'm a beginner , Beaulieu ? If you try anything , I 'll depressurate , I 'll depressify ... I 'll depressu ... One second ... I 'll depress the price of preserves ... If you try anything , I 'll depressurize the station . For France and Charlemagne ! Attack ! Long live Charlemagne ! Down with Ninjas ! OK , he 's coming out . Minister , Bernard Guerin is free . He 's stopped . He 's thrown away his bag . Yes , Minister , that 's correct . A fireball shot from a catapult . - Cut ! You can print it . - Cool . Next we 'll do the scene between Charlemagne and the Head Ninja . Mrs Cardoux ? Come with us , please . Still no news of the Noah mission crew , with its 2 civilian members . Colonel , can I talk to you ? Come in . I packed my things . I left the shampoo , it 's half full . - When are you taking me home ? - Sorry ? I 'm bored with this ! I want out ! Have a seat and calm down . When they free Yonis 's brother , you 'll go home . And if they don 't ? You got a plan ? I 'm just a tourist here . Right ! You don 't belong here ! You belong in a 2 star hotel in Tunisia with archery contests and camel rides ! You know the Hotel Oasis ? You 're a tiresome idiot ! I said space is no place for civilians . I won a contest ... Now I forgot my line ... Yes . Respect me , as I respect you ! Get me back to my planet ! I want to see my wife and son . Space agency technicians are still trying to contact them . " The situation isn 't hopeless " , according to the Transportation Secretary . " No , the situation isn 't hopeless . " Excuse me . Hi , Hugo . - You OK ? - Right . Don 't worry , we have a big problem , we can 't reach the Earth . But the people are nice , so I 'll be back earlier . What is it ? - He 's behind me ? - Cardoux ... Give me your phone . Hugo , where are you ? Put on Werburger . A catapult , that 's right . Listen , Colonel , you must find Guerin and neutralize him . Seeing how grave things are , you may use procedure B 716 . B 716 ? No one has ... It 's our only chance . And if it fails ? - Then you know what to do . - No . Yes , you do ! Beaulieu , you know ! No , I don 't . If it fails , you autodes ... If it fails , you autodes ... Sorry . Suzette is subject to ... Suzette is subject to seizures ... You autodestroy the station ! Got that , Colonel ? Now what do I do ? Poushy , Yonis will call ... Guerin will call in 15 minutes . Play for time . Find a solution ! Don 'tjust sit there ! I feel sick , I 'll fog up things . I 'm going out . Stay there ! Why me ? I don 't like procedure B 716 . Use Rochette , he 's been idle . Calm down . You ate beside Yonis ? Slip this transmitter into his right pocket . There . The right pocket . - I know where a pocket is . - Look . - OK . - Look at the pocket . - I know where it is . - Look ! - There . - Take it . You know where he 's hiding ? I don 't know where , but I know when . You 'll only have 2 minutes to act . Soizic , if we don 't get back ... Hold it ! If we don 't get back ? I warn you , if we don 't get back , I 'll sue you ... You 'll be in serious trifles . My grandma 's recipe . A Breton lady who taught me her knowhow and love of good things . She still around ? Yes . Jailed for hashish dealing . - Bravo , Captain , they 're really ... - Really ... The best pancakes I ate . Thanks , Colonel . They have a minute left . They won 't make it . What movies do you like ? Talkies in general . What was your last movie ? " Lord of the ... No , I 've never been in a movie . I 'm a corporate actor . I perform in conventions . Gotta make a living ! Don 't be ashamed of it . What are you doing ? The Peruvians , I hear , don 't have a rocket ! Not a one . Sir , I 've got a signal . Bravo , Beaulieu . Now they 'll locate him . - Where are we ? - Don 't move . It 's just a glitch . Won 't last . Bravo , Cardoux . Not too shaken ? No , fine . It was a cinch . I tell you , I almost punched that Yonis in the nose . But as we were in the past , I held back . Sir ! We can trick Guerin into thinking his brother is still alive . We have 2 minutes before he calls . Interpol sent me this from Bernard Guerin 's answerphone . " The Freeway Interchange . " Listen ... Hi , this is Bernard Guerin . I 'm not in . I 'm in Niort . Back on the 30th . Leave a message , if you must , after the tone . So what ? You 're his brother calling . Ask me questions . Who is this ? Ber ... nard . Any cops there ? I 'm coming . No need . Poushy , you 're a genius ! In 90 feet , take a left . He 's in the West wing . At the recuperation room , take the right hand corridor . Colonel , you 'd better tiptoe . Only half a mile to go . Now 's the time . No , don 't leave . He can 't see us . Well , Werburger . Your last mission 's tough ? I hope you obeyed . Is my brother free ? Connect me to him ! If there 's any problem , we crash . OK , you can speak to him . Hello , Bernard ? How are you ? Fine . I 'm so glad to hear you . Fine , fine . You sound moved . Jail must be tough , huh ? Fine , fine . I understand . You can 't speak . Someone 's with you ? Ber ... Ber . You 're with a Berber ? Who is it ? Dédé . Who 's Dédé ? Where are you ? Niort . You 're in Niort with Dédé the Berber ? I want to be sure it 's you . Here 's a question only you can answer . What color was the sweater of the neighbor 's son who you made drink gas ? Green . Forgive me , for doubting it was you . Werburger ! Alexander , we had a big problem . Your brother ... is dead . He was crushed by a catapult . We couldn 't save him . We must negotiate . Over nothing , Werburger . Nothing ... Now my brother 's dead , I have nothing to lose . I 'll break your station , your little toy ! The blame is all yours , Mr Werburger ! Bernard ! Colonel , take a left . Colonel , find him , or you 'll all die ! Cardoux , all this is fine , Beaulieu is alone and rattled . So stop talking : it 's my mike ! Colonel , you 're close . You 're 3 pikes from him . That 's 9 feet , for you people . He 's in there . Room service ! Leave the tray by the door . He 's headed north . Attention . Block 13 in depressurisa ... in depersuasa ... One second ... Pierrette presses prunes prior to prodding Patrick . OK . Careful , Block 13 is depressurizing . Block 13 isolated in 2 minutes . He 's in Block 28 . Sorry about your brother . I 've waited so long for this ! Colonel ? I 've lost contact . Surrender now , and I 'll testify for you . Remember ? No face hits , no knots , only moisten once . Let 's change the rules . It 's no holds barred . The first to die loses . If I squeeze the trigger , the bullet will tear out of the barrel , and lodge in your brain , as you taste blood and long for your mother 's breast ! Thanks , Cardoux . Get up ! Move ! Stop ! Soizic ... Lock him in his cabin . I 'll contact the base so we can leave . For good old planet Earth ! You disappointed me . - I 'm sorry . - I was hot for your fat nose . It 's a pity , Soizic . Life isn 't fair . In different circumstances , - we could 've ... - What ? Journeyed a few miles together . It 's funny , I see us both by the seaside . The weather 'd always be fine . Well , not always . Mornings , I 'd drop you at the lighthouse , then go fish for sea-urchins to feed us . You 'd climb to the top of the lighthouse and guide the supertankers as they rounded the point . We 'd have four children : Gwenaelle ... Merlin , Broceliande and Claude . No , Erwann . I see us madly in love . And after 20 years together we 'd still dance the gavotte , naked , and kiss with cider in our mouths ... Go on ! Yes , that one ! This is your Captain , thanks for choosing our company . The outside temperature is 32 degrees . Our estimated arrival is 6.45 PM . Announce a delay ! Where 's Soizic ? You killed her ! You ate her ? Of course not ! I 'm sorry , Colonel . I hadn 't foreseen that ... Get up ! Cardoux ! It 's no use . It 's tempered titanium glass . Like the Pope-Mobile . You been in love with her long ? 2 years . Did you tell her ? You should 've . It helps ! I was going to . Let me see that ... Don 't play with it , I 'm not amused . Keep away from children and poultry What are they up to , dammit ? The station is heading to Earth ! They 've failed . I should have picked Colonel Chaussard . Danger ! Impact with Earth in 16 minutes . New descent parameters recorded . Is this your doing ? You promised to stop this madness ! Killing people isn 't nice ! We were going to run off and spare them . And live on love and Evian ! They killed my brother . They must pay . Get in ! Get in ! Ejection of emergency capsule . Calculate the descent angle , find out where ... Fast ! What 's going on ? Let me by ! Let me by ! What 's going on ? Mrs Cardoux , be brave . I fear the worst . What does it mean ? The station may crash . If your husband dies , France will give him a State funeral , and a stage of the Tour de France will be named for him . Today it 's the well-known Cardoux stage , 168 miles long . As for you kid , soon you 'll have to shave . Be brave ! That 's no good ... that 's too high ... Not there ... or there ... If I 'm right , here 's where we should ... I 've got it ! I know where the station will crash ! It 'll crash on the town of Mouchette . - In central France . - What big city is it near ? Near nothing . Mouchette 's a dump . Call City Hall , tell them to evacuate . But don 't panic them ! Just say an orbital station will crash on them . Why did he pick that dump ? I 'm a Mouchettian . I was born there . I know why he chose that village . It 's where my wife and I are retiring . Loosen your reins . Once more round ... Then we 'll go clean Laurel 's hooves . Once round , at a trot . Go on ! Danger ! Re-entry in 6 minutes . Colonel , what 's going on ? I need my pills ! Try a stick of gum ? My pills ! Are you sick ? I 'm afraid of flying . In anything that flies . I promise . I won 't tell a soul . I 'll get you back to the cockpit . Be brave . We 're almost there . - What 's that ? - Don 't stop . No time . It can 't be ... It 's Teddy , the gobbler ! Come with me . Door , Enrico ! Door , Enrico ! Danger ! Re-entry in 4 minutes . My stomach . The pancakes . Remember , I dined twice . - What did you tell him ? - Dunno , what do we do ? We run for it . It hurts ! Open up ! Enrico ! - Open the log book ! - Open . It 's the end , I 've lived and loved ! Lived to the hilt ! Now I have a bitter taste ! Of gobbler ! If you find my body , cremate it , scatter my ashes at high noon . Your turn . To see Phnom-Penh again ... - You lived there ? - No . But I love saying Phnom-Penh . Die , you lousy gobbler ! Re-entry in 3 minutes ! Shuttle doomed ! Abandon ship ! I 'm so ashamed , Colonel . I know ... Yonis ... it was my fault . I know ... Oh , shit . You saved us , Soizic . - I 've waited years to tell you . - I know ... Colonel , if we survive this , and you want to lie on me starko ... I 'll go for it . Come on . We must stop the shuttle . Re-entry in 1 minute 30 . What a downer , Sir . Re-entry is imminent . It 's the end , Poushy . It 's ghastly . God be with them . We 're going to be squashed . And I 've never known love ! I can 't do it . It 's too complex . He scrambled all the knobs . Cardoux ! You 're not shit . I 'm proud I knew you . Farewell ! Self-destruction . End of movie No , Colonel ! Give it a try , please ! My son taught me never to give up . It 's too late . No , there 's always a solution ! When you play " Spot the 7 differences " , one man has a pipe , the other doesn 't . One little girl has laces , the other doesn 't . You look and look for that last difference . You say , I 'll never find it ! Suddenly there it is , in front of you ! One guy has glasses . But the other one doesn 't ! Glasses ! There 's still a solution ! Wait , don 't move ! 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... I 'll never get over this . Werburger , the shuttle is AOK again ! Please , I 'd like to speak to my wife . Isabelle ? While I flew among the stars , I wrote this poem for you . " I see Uranus , and think of us on a bus . " I see Saturn , and it 's for you I yearn . " Rhymes better than " burn " . " Now Pluto is in sight , I 've missed you on this flight . " Then I see the Milky Way , and hope you 'll be back some day . Or " back to stay " , you choose . There . They 're back . With a hero 's welcome . My dad gave me his ticket . And I kept it . My whole life was built around it . My father 's adventure . Now I take that ticket ... on all my missions . It 's my good luck charm . Thanks , Captain . Thank you . Zorgax 1 to Base . Ready for takeoff . OK , Colonel Cardoux . Takeoff in 1 minute . Good luck , Zorgax 1 . Satellite connection activated . You can start , Hugo . Good evening . I 'm proud to be the first man to walk on the sun . I dedicate this mission to my parents , Stéphane and Isabelle Cardoux , to Col. Beaulieu and Capt. Soizic Le Guilvinec . I thank you . He 's left ! Where is he ? I 've got him ! 25 degrees to the right . Yes , I see him . It 's my son . My battle ! She hasn 't changed . Or aged . Lend me your pushover , I 'm chilly . Sure , my love . But she 's a bit spacey . Bruno ! Boil some water and open the oysters ! Look , he 's gone , he 's up there . There , you see him ? Hugo ! My little fella ! Little fella ... Have a nice trip ! OK , I 'm not a woman , so I 'm a man ? I 'm a man . Am I famous ? I 'm famous ... An athlete ? Not an athlete . Showbiz ? Showbiz . OK , am I a singer ? But you said showbiz ! An actor ? OK , an actor ... There you are . Don 't forget , in life what really matters , is love and friendship among men and all peoples .

 You fucking tea-bagged him ! Turn me Around . Good run , Kable . My name 's Tillman . Whatever your name is , you got to the save point fast . Who the fuck cares ? No one 's getting out of here alive . - I am . I 'm gonna make it out . Sure you will . They say you got three battles left before you get out . PRODUCER Bob , heh . Yep . Bob . All right , let me handle this . Bob . Do we have the interview or don 't we ? Yes . We are cunt-hair close . I 'm not gonna blow the Three Asian War for " close . " With all due respect , nobody cares about dead Orientals . They care about Ken Castle . Can I hear from Gina , please ? Okay , Bob . Bob . Are you aware Castle has clocked one media appearance ? And that was Walters ' last interview before she died nine years ago . Stop menstruating and just tell me whether we fucking have it . We fucking have it . Good . Palindromes . Okay , focus . Um , let 's get lunch . Iranian , sushi or Mexican ? Uh , no , uh , burger-chili-fry . - I could freak a burger . - Let 's do it . We live in society . We visit " Society . " I mean , which one 's ... ? Which one 's more real , really ? I mean , which one 's really real ? You know what I mean ? You 're watching Gina Parker Smith ... A live Worldlink Tonight exclusive . This motherfucker is off the charts . - He could buy the network . - Yeah , why would he ? Son of a bitch pulls in 650 million pay-per-views for a single broadcast . Going live . Five , four , three , two , one . First , there was " Society " . The ultimate SIM environment Where players don 't control . Virtual animated characters But actual living . Breathing human beings . They walked them . They talked them . They juiced them . They rocked them . Rickedy-dickedy-doo . We had that on T-shirts back in 2010 . The creation of reclusive genius Ken Castle ... Who is Ken Castle ? GINA : ... " Society " took the world by storm ... Becoming the number one ... Guilty pleasure ... Of billions . You can get paid to be controlled . Or you pay to control . And generating one of the world 's ... Largest private fortunes , surpassing ... Bill Gates practically overnight . Nine months ago ... Castle unveiled ... A new simulation ... One that would take gaming to new heights ... Of thrilling excess and controversy . " Slayers . " If " Society " let us live through others ... " Slayers " would let us ... Die through others . " Slayers " gives the gamer full control ... Of a flesh-and-blood human being in full-scale ... Kill-or-be-killed combat . And when we say " flesh and blood " ... We mean flesh ... And blood . " Slayers . " " Slayers . " Heh , heh . Why isn 't it murder ? When was the last time ... You saw somebody volunteer to be murdered ? You know every last one of our Slayers ... Is a bona fide death-row inmate ... Offered to participate as an alternative to their sentence . Stay alive for 30 sessions ... Get set free . That 's not a bad goddamned deal . Has any of these men or women survived ... Long enough to be set free ? I 'd remind your audience " Slayers " was put together ... With the full cooperation of the United States federal government . The revenue it produces is responsible for funding ... Our entire prison system , keeping the bad guys behind bars ... And that the prop was voted for by 68 percent ... - ... of the American public . - In an election tainted by suspected ... Digital fraud . Let 's talk about the so-called ... " genericons " ... Sent into the " Slayers " ... Environment ... With pre-programmed actions ... With no one controlling them ... And no way to react . Their chances of survival are next to nil . Plenty of men and women in prison who 'd never cut it as Slayers . Shouldn 't they be given the same chance ? Roll the dice for a ticket out ? They only need to survive one session . Right . So , Mr. Castle , how the hell does it work ? It begins with a single nano cell ... Planted in the motor cortex of the brain . This cell can replicate ... Replacing the cells around it with perfect copies . And these copied cells contain remote-access functionality . Therefore , nano plus cortex ... Equals a nanex . Isn 't it true that every human that undergoes this procedure ... Will have a distinct lP address ... Like a mobile device ... Or a notebook computer ? Similar , but control is localized ... To the parameters of our gaming environments . You take " Society , " for instance . Once a cast member ... Has left the workplace , they are free ... From the control and monitoring of their player . Well , that 's a relief . Well , to some , maybe . To some . Don 't you suspect a good many folks wouldn 't mind a bit of control ? - Uh , uh ... - Someone else making ... All the decisions for you . No tough choices ... No responsibilities . Think about it . We will , Mr. Castle . We will . The Gina Parker Smith Show , sponsored by : " Slayers . " A good little talk . Oh , shit , my pleasure . Can I just tell you , I cannot ... Wait until the next " Slayers . " I mean , Kable has been unbelievable . His arms are just so ... Well , I know it 's terrible . Uh , what the hell was that ? Ken Castle wants you to believe you are living in a better world . He 's a liar . Mind control ... Is slavery . Sorry . Mr. Castle ... - ... we have no idea ... - Shh . Shush . We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue . That 's a goddamn hoot . This is nuts . The signal is generating simultaneously from six countries . Bypass orbital and reroute to the backup servers , please . Now ! Uh , Mr. Castle ... We can 't stop every virus that sneaks in . You might wanna let my boys take a look at your firewall . We 're on it . They 'll be off the air momentarily . So sorry . I 'm just ... What about you , sugar ? Wonder if I might ... Breach your firewall one of these days ? You 're bad . He 's good . Hit him ! Fuck him up ! Get down ! Everybody , get down ! Get down ! Get the fuck down ! Get down . Get down . Open fire ! Get down ! Kable . Kable . Kable , Kable , Kable . My name 's Tillman . Yeah , yeah , ha , ha . Yeah , Tillsman , Tillsman . They said your name was Tillsman . Ha , ha . You 're always just sitting , huh ? Always sitting and looking . Just looking and sitting . Just like me , man . I keep my holes down . You gotta keep your holes down . Every day , a dude inevitably snaps , breaks , starts to crack up . You know why ? Because we don 't know if we 're gonna live a day or two or die . Everybody but you . Right ? Twenty-seven battles , huh ? Three to go . No one 's ever done that . No one 's ever come close . No one 's gotten 10 games without getting shot . Everybody but Kable . Kable , Kable . Because he 's sitting and looking , huh , man ? You got a plan in your head . You got a mission . You never break , you never snap . Never say shit , either . But you take care of your business , don 't you ? Niggas could get spooked by that kind of single-mindedness ... Because you spooky . You spook me . What you in for , huh ? You wanna get back to them . It 's all you think about . It 's the only thing that keeps you alive . Who 's talking ? Sign it . - What ? - Sign it . Please , Tillman . My son , David . He 's your biggest fan . He prays for you . I need to prove it 's authentic . Makes it worth more . Why would anyone want my name ? You don 't know what 's going on out there , do you ? All medical personnel report to Central Processing . - Gotta go . No , no , no , wait . How did you get this picture ? Have you seen them ? Hey . Hi . So , what 's your damage ? You know , just hanging out ... Looking to meet people . To meet people . Lucky you . You met me . I 'm Nika . I 'm Dale . I like your fur . I like your fur . Do you wanna go somewhere ? You wanna go somewhere ? We are somewhere . We are somewhere . Ken Castle ... Is a liar . He 's a liar . We will all be his dog . Fuck ! A new video prank by the subversive group Humanz ... Caused a nationwide stir today . All contact between Society City ... And three quarter of a million players ... Was down for three hours ... While technicians worked to remove what they described ... As a " satellite infection . " These pranks , at first attributed to rogue isolated hackers ... Are now suspected to be ... The work of an elaborate and sophisticated network ... Of programming cells ... - ... spread across several countries . - Ha-ha-ha . Experts estimate the service interruption ... Will end up costing Castle billions ... In revenue . Well , don 't cry for Castle . He can cover this with the change in his couch cushions . - Hmm . On a personal note ... That shit was fucked up . Yeah , it was . I literally pissed myself . Sounds like fun . Seriously , these Humanz cocksuckers ... They 're out of control . Sandra . Quiet . My name 's Sandra . Stop talking . Can 't say I didn 't try . Fuck , yeah ! We 're all gonna die , ha , ha . Oh , my God . Let me out of here ! I 'm not supposed to be in here ! Who are they ? Who the fuck are they ? Who the fuck is playing us , man ? Shut up , fish . Gay . Gay , gay . Retardedly gay . Hmm . Swarmers . - Swarmers . The latest innovation from Browning . This self-detonating cartridge ... Offers the deadliest spray from a full-tracking cornering ordnance . Daddy like . Simon ! Ugh , Fangirl , stop hacking me . You 're gonna get my boyfriend killed ... Before he can get out of jail and fill me up with hot seed . Simon , I just wanna play you . - Forget about that star-fucker . - Shut up , bitch ! When am I gonna get to meet you ... For , like , reals ? What 's that ? Aah . What 's up , loser ? Mom says go to college ... Move the fuck out ... And , oh , yeah ... You 're a sick retard . You 're pathetic . You smell like Jeffrey Dahmer . Wanna make out ? You wish . Can 't wait till they cut you off . Eat balls , bitch . Simon ? Maybe . Oh , my God ! It 's really you ! Nice . Do you wanna see our tits , Simon ? Yes . Yes , I do . Hmm , now that we have your attention ... Here 's an offer that you can 't refuse . Oh , here we go . Fifty million euros ... For control of Kable . Instant transfer to the account of your choice . Kable 's not for sale . Thank you . Baby , make it 100 . It 's been real . What the fuck ? If you wanna talk to Kable , we can show you how . If you wanna talk to Kable , we can show you how . Look at it . The new face of " Slayers . " Pure , crystallized horror ... Two stories high , and bathed in bloody red . He is what they want . They love Kable . They do now , heh . But when they watch their hero die right in front of their eyeballs ... So sharp and vivid ... It feels like you could reach out and touch the wet flesh ... They 're gonna change their point of view . They 'll be seduced by the power , the violence , the dominance . - It 's human nature . - Kable 's made it through 28 battles . Every player in the game is trying to take him out . Yeah , Kable 's a perfect soldier . He 's a tactical killing computer . His only vulnerability is the nanex itself ... The : The delay between Simon 's commands ... And Kable 's ability to execute . So why should this one be any different ? Who controls him ? No one . Get it out of me ! What happened to this one ? Look like he escaped . All right , girls . Back to your Jazzercise . That 's Hackman . Hackman . Hackman-Nackman . He killed a whole mess of people . Killed himself all kinds of people . And then one day ... He walks up and turns himself in . He wants to be inside ... Or some crazy shit like that . You know what I 'm saying ? There 's always gonna be Slayers , man . As long as motherfuckers running around killing himself ... Kable . Let 's go . Upgrades . Come on . Why don 't you upgrade ... A brother ? Why don 't you shut the fuck up ? Why don 't you shut the fuck up ? Shut the fuck up . Fucking shut the fuck up . Who aims ? What ? Who aims ? The player or the Slayer ? I 'm the hand . Someone somewhere else is the eye . That 's tripped out , man . Sometimes ... They take over completely . They ... Move you around like a robot . But that don 't work so good . Why ? The delay . Yeah , the ping . They talk about that . About how long it takes the Slayer to respond to the command . Whatever they call it ... A slice of a second out there is the difference ... Between living and dying . When that trigger pulls ... It 's just me . Hey , Kable . Look . I just killed someone . This is the blood . Look . He 's back here . Wanna see ? You know , your head ain 't on straight . I 'm gonna kill you too on Sunday . Yeah , probably . That 's why they put me here . I 've got no strings . I 've got no strings . So I have fun I 'm not tied up to anyone . They 've got strings But you can see . There are no strings . On me . You got two whores , Kable . The fuck you say ? On the outside . I 'm sorry . I meant your pretty girls . So you wanna get back to them . But I 'm gonna visit them first . All right . Kable . Kable , dude . It 's me . - It 's me . - Who ? Simon . I 'm playing you . How come I can hear you ? Well , it 's a mod . Gamers can 't talk to cons . - I know . It 's fucking unbelievable . This is amazing . It 's cool , yeah ? No , it 's not cool . Pay attention to the fucking game . All right , I got it . I got it . What are you , 12 ? I 'm 17 , actually . Thank you . This is unbelievable . How am I not dead yet ? Because I 'm a badass motherfucker . Shit . I 'm making my cut , gonna scatter . Freek ... You shouldn 't be here . I wanna put down . I wanna work . I wanna rock . I 'm gonna make it . I 'm going . Gibs . What ? Like " giblets . " Uh , Kibbles ' n Bits . Chunks . Pieces ... Everywhere . These are real humans , fucker . Death row psychos . So what ? They had it coming anyway ... Right ? - L guess that goes for me too . - Yeah , but you 're different . Different ? How ? I don 't know . Because you 're my psycho . Damn , new area . Think about it , Kable . All the shit we 've been through together . What an epic run , man . It 's gonna suck to see it end . Are you fucking kidding me ? Well , yeah . I get that , for you , it 's different . This way . There 's nothing there . Trust me , kid . It 's a restricted area . It 's beyond the borders ... Of the game . I couldn 't put you there even if I tried . Warning . Access denied . Shit . Shit . Oh . Bye , Kable . Get him , get him . Come on . Kid 's gonna get me killed . Dude , I 'm right here , man . I can hear you . Listen to me . I don 't know who 's behind it or why , but I was supposed to die tonight . They 're gunning for us . Now , I can beat them . But not with you controlling me . What the hell are you talking about ? Turn me loose , kid . You wanna win , turn me loose . - I can 't . Find a way . Bastard . So , Miss Roth ... It says you 're applying for custody of your daughter . - Delia . Her name is Delia . - Spouse incarcerated ... Life without possibility of parole . You use your maiden name ? Uh-huh , um ... My husband , he 's ... . It 's not entirely true , regarding his sentence . In fact , he 's due to be released soon . Miss Roth , your husband was charged and ... . He was charged and convicted of first-degree murder . I hardly consider ... His release , if it were to happen at all ... I don 't think that 'd be a good thing . So it says you 're an actor ? I don 't know that I 've seen you in anything . I work in " Society . " - It 's a job . - Miss Roth ... Your child has been exceedingly well-placed . The family is wealthy . She 'll never want for anything . Now , I can understand ... That you love your daughter , probably very much , but do you ... Really think that she would be better off with ... People like you ? Yes , I do . I 'm her mother . We will give ... Your application all the consideration it merits . You like the software ? Software ? The walkie-talkie , player . No shit . You 're the guy from the TV , the Humanz . That 's right , baby . You think about what the brother said ? To what brother do you refer , brother ? Kable wants the freedom to ass-kick , do shit his way . You gonna give it to him ? You were listening ? We see and hear everything . Everything that goes on ... Inside the so-called game . All right , then . Kable said we got lucky . They were gunning ... For us . What 's that about ? Kable got a past . He knows things . He knows things , things he don 't even know he knows . What things ? Things that CastleJs afraid of . As long as your boy stays on the inside ... Castle knows he can keep him quiet . But if he ever got out ? Mm-mm . Castle would never let that happen . There 's one battle left . I think I can handle my own business . Thank you very much . You 're not hearing me . This is not something you can control . This is not something you can control . They 're gonna kill his ass , Simon . In the eyes of the world , and then what ? You another poor ... Little , rich honky . Poor , little , rich honky . Poor , little , rich honky . No Kable , no pussy , no shit . Look , man , this ... . This is too heavy . I don 't even know what the hell you 're talking about . I just play games , man . Games . That 's right . It is a game . You wanna win it ? Yeah , I intend to . Then you need to cut your strings ... Puppet master . Imagine a Slayer that don 't gotta wait ... To be told what to do . No ping , you dig ? That would be cheating . A mod . That 's all it would be . You know why ? Because the game 's gotta evolve . You feel me ? I do . I do feel you , my giant brother . Well , then , let 's rock , baby . Tillman . We know you talked to him . Your player . - Who are you ? - A friend . I don 't have any . Listen to me . Simon 's going to give you what you want , what you asked him for . - How do you know that ? - I know something else . Whether or not he 's controlling you , you will never reach the save point . Castle won 't allow it . We 'll see . No . You have to escape . Your wife and your daughter need you , Tillman . If you wanna see the people in the picture ... You 'll have to find another way . I need you to get me something . What , Tillman ? Drunk . What have you got there ? Kable , what the hell is that ? Put it down . Put it down ! Fuckface ... Throw the bottle in the trash . Oh , I see it was ... A great idea turning you loose . - What happened ? - You happened . You wanted control . You got it . What 's the matter with you , Kable ? Kill something . This is unbelievable . Kable ... Listen . This is the last game . You 're gonna end up dead . I 'm gonna look like a total asshole ... If you don 't pull your balls together . Damn it ! Kable ... What the hell are you doing ? Oh , what the hell ? That 's just gross , bro . Oh . Go , go , go ! Anything else , you fucking cheerleader ? Motherfucker ! Kable , please . Please , I beg you , get back in the game . You 're screwing my ass ... Here , Kable . This is a restricted area . Return to the battle zone . I 'm dead . What the fuck just happened ? Initial reports are that Kable ... The most recognizable face of the ' JSlayers " phenomenon ... Next to Ken Castle himself , is officially listed as ' Jfragged . J ' . Just one session away ... From being the first Slayer ever ... To win a full pardon and release . In a netcast plagued by technical difficulties ... And dead spots , the report could not be confirmed . However , Kable ... Born John Tillman of Albany , New York ... And convicted of murder ... Just four years ago ... Has been removed from " Slayers " ... Rosters and upcoming events listings . His player , megastar Simon Silverton , could not be reached for comment . Uh-oh . You have a question ? Tillman left a wife on the outside , right ? - Tillman ? Yeah . - Find her . Ooh . Link activated . She 's not home . But Castle 's personal security will be soon enough ... And trust me , you don 't wanna meet them . Who are you ? You asked me that once before . Your voice ... . You should come with me . Like now . See , that 's why you 're a fool . That 's what I 'm talking about . Who 's that ? Would you stop it with that freaky off-the-rails shit ? That 's why it 's a game of deception , man . Yeah ! Ooh ! Ha , ha . That 's bullshit , man . You know that 's bullshit . You 're the ones who broke me out ? We only freed your mind . And your ass followed . Holy shit , puppy . You made it . You 're really here . Ahem , Kable . You 're great . You got questions . A few . So she took my blood . Why ? The nanex . It modifies the actual cell structure of your brain . We can crack it , but it 's not a one-size-fits-all . We need your DNA so that we can ... Generate custom code . All right . Then why me ? Castle 's afraid of you . It ain 't just the game . Every day there 's more people ... Wanna be a part of Castle 's world , throwing away ... Everything human . Right now , it 's the desperate ones . Convicts ... Addicts , the sick , the poor ... The ones that fall through the cracks . Federal prison system 's out of control ... Set to bankrupt the whole damn U.S.A. Then Castle rides in ... On a white horse . Says he has a plan to bail us out and we fall in line ? Health care is collapsing . He 's pushing for total control over genetic disease . Birth defects no longer an issue . All we do is exchange cells for ones he gives us . Promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet . You think people will refuse ? Fuck , no . Then the next thing you know ... We 're all slaves . I can 't help you . Tillman ... We know where she is . Use your tongue . Hi , Nika . Oh , hi . Rick Rape ? Rick Rape , right ? I thought you weren 't allowed here anymore . That was last month . I was a bad boy . Are you still a bad boy ? Going down . Please don 't kill me . No . I 'll do anything . No , don 't say that . DonJt say that . No . No . Baby , stop . Stop . Goddamn it , you in there controlling her , let her talk . I can 't . She has to say what I tell her . No , you can hear me . I know you can . I love you . I love you too . I love you ... Shut up ! You say anything else ... And I will find you . I will rip you to fucking pieces ... You understand ? I 'm getting you out of here . I 'm gonna take you someplace where they can turn it off . The program . Hi , Kable . Going down . Look ... At me , bitch . Anybody in there ? Going down . Go on . Do it . Lobby . Going up . Where the fuck do we go ? Laser ! Get down . I love this place , man ! Shot that motherfucker ... In the head ! I can get you out of here . Oh , shit . I can 't believe it 's you . This is ... Listen . Tillman , you can trust me . I swear . If not ... You 're dead . Okay , faster , faster . Guess you remember that day ? You 'd gotten Kable through his 10th consecutive ... Session alive . No one ever thought an I-Con could last that long . Pretty hot shit , aren 't you ? King player . - Good times . - Sure , on the outside . Now , look at these . That 's what it 's like on the inside . Wonder how long you would last ... On the other side of the screen . You know , Simon , you 're being held here today ... Suspected in aiding in the escape of a convicted ... Murderer from a maximum security penitentiary . Heh , the charges are beyond serious . Your hard drives have been seized . Forensics is decrypting the contents ... As we speak . Your internet activity over the last 10 years is being ... Scrutinized and cataloged ... In minute vivid detail . In addition ... Your father 's bank accounts have been frozen ... Pending further investigation . After all ... It was essentially his money that funded Mr. Tillman 's escape . Now , I need you to tell me ... Everything that happened leading up to ... Yesterday afternoon . Everybody you talked to . Everything you saw . Everything you did . And I need you to tell me that right now . Yeah , um ... I 'm gonna need something too . Oh , really ? And what might that be ? Could you guys do a sandwich ... Like peanut butter ... Almond butter , walnut butter ... Uh , pecan butter ... Pistachio butter , um ... Pretty much any kind of , you know , nut butter ? With some grape jelly . Pistachio butter . They make that ? It 's awesome . Now what ? Now ... We put the DNA into the soup , light it up ... Extract it , feed my girl 's sequence into the code ... And we are good to go . - It 's an anti-spyware program . - Basically . We can 't quarantine the foreign cells , per se ... But we can disable their ability to transmit and receive . Fuck that . I 'd make you cut it out of me . That 'd be like cutting out part of your brain . The nano cells replace the cells they replicate . They become you . We have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link . Otherwise she 's broadcasting everything she sees or hears . Thirty minutes . You give us a robot , we give you back a super hot human . Tillman . We need to talk . - So talk . - Come on . They tested it on soldiers . The first volunteer was a Corporal Travis Scotch ... A friend of yours , I believe . And the second was you . The idea was to replace your brain . Bit by bit , cell by cell . The new tissue would ... Never break down , never deteriorate . " A new era in human longevity . " That 's what they told us . Nine weeks later ... Scotch was dead . And you were serving life in maximum . Castle 's project was shut down . But the same technology resurfaced within a year . In a game . Castle called it " Society . " Listen , whatever happened ... In that project is something Castle wanted buried . We need that shit , man . What you saw . What you know . I don 't know what to tell you . You ain 't gotta tell me shit . I want you to show me . Okay , we 're ready to rock . Break the link in three , two , one . Who 's there ? What are you doing here ? Who are you ? Tech support . What are we looking at ? His memories translated into ... Raw audio-visual data . I read something about this . That tech 's not supposed to be available for another decade . They 'll have better shit than this at Best Buy in 18 months . Son of a bitch . John Tillman . Man , I never thought I would be so happy to see your ugly face . Scotch . Man , is it me ... Or does this place fucking suck ? They got me hooked up to computers five hours a day . Feeding me vitamins and pills and God knows what ... Giving me injections , taking and giving me blood . These nurses are wiping my ass . And they 're male nurses too , bro . I can 't believe I let you talk me into this . And I 'm having these , like , blackouts . They 're scaring the shit out of me . I mean , I don 't even know how long I 've been here . Hey , man . Uh ... Are they letting you out already ... You son of a bitch ? I 'm not getting out . Okay . John , are you good ? I 'm fine . Man , you don 't look fine . I 'm sorry . Yeah ... That 's okay . It 's not like you looked that good in the first place . What 's the gun for , John ? What 's happening ? Shh . Shh . Really , you 're scaring me . - What 's the gun for ? - I can 't stop . I can 't stop . It isn 't ... Stop what ? I can 't ... . God ... Stop it . You 're scaring me . - Stop it . - I 'm sorry , Scotch . No . John , don 't . Stop . Not the best commercial for Ken Castle . He made him do it . Castle made him do it . - It was a test . Cha-ching . Excuse me , media whore . This isn 't just a story . The whole world is splitting down the middle . Everyone 's gonna have ... To take a side . - Even scavengers like you . - Um ... It 's you . I missed you so much . You 're the reason I held on . I love you . Where 's our daughter ? I couldn 't stop them . - Oh , babe . - I 'm sorry . Nobody could . The foster parent paid good money ... To remain anonymous . But there 's always a data trail if you know where to look . Where is she ? I 'm sorry , Tillman . She 's with Castle . Tillman . That 's all the story you 're gonna get . Silverton , get up . What 's up ? What 's going on , man ? Looks like someone up the chain decided you 're no longer a threat . Okay . You are a cheater . You are a cheater . You are a cheater . You are a cheater . We 'll find him . Don 't worry . He 'll come to us . Delia . Not bad for video , huh ? What ? The latest and greatest . I defy you to tell it from real life . Can you imagine porn on this thing ? You 're awesome . Castle . Kable . - I don 't care about you . - You just want ... Your little sugar pie . I know . Don 't do anything stupid . My house ... My rules . Come on . I wanna show you something . I wanted to thank you for leading me to them , by the way . The Humanz 's cell , that is . I killed most of them . Sooner or later , they 'd be whistling my tune just like everybody else . It was that cracker program ... That got my attention . That was a genuine nuisance . No doubt about it . One thing even they didn 't know . I 'm wired too . I replaced ... 98 percent of my own noodle with nano tissue years ago . But mine 's different . It 's built to send . To transmit . Whereas every other nano cell that I put out there ... Including the ones in your head , Kable ... Are designed to receive . I think it and you do it . We 're talking every Slayer , everyone in Society City . Your better half would fall under ... That category . Provided they 're within range of my transmitters . Very nice , Castle . So you got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you . You 're thinking small , Kable . But not as small as me . Heh . See , nano cells ... Are real small . A thousand times smaller than these dust particulates . You inhale it , they go to work replicating ... Spreading like a virus , multiplying in exponentials . Six months ' time , I could have a hundred million people converted . Ditch diggers , porn stars and presidents . Not one would be the wiser . A hundred million people who buy what I want them to buy ... Vote how I want them to vote ... And do ... Pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do . For instance ... . You should have let him fight for himself . Maybe he would have had a shot . You 're missing the point . No , I get it . You 're pulling all the strings around here . Which makes my next move ... Pretty stupid . I neglected to mention my smart boys ... Reversed that crack the Humanz worked . Easy-breezy ... Once I had access to their drives . You 're mine , boy . Come on . Let 's boogie-woogie rock ' n ' roll ! Whoop . Whoop . Ha-ha-ha . The baddest Slayer in the game ... Doesn 't seem like much . Ow . Whoa . Lucky shot . Not really . I need an audience ... Boys . No , no , no , you crawl . On your belly ... Like a toad . Is this bad ? I 'm really bad . Ha . Is this bad ? I 'm really bad . Ha . That 's sweet . Boys ... You ready ? It 's time ... For a true test . Just like last time . Remember ? You 're stronger now . More fight in you ... But I think the end result will be ... Just about the same . No . I am right here with you . What the hell was that ? Someone outside is sending him commands . We 're being broadcast live . Well , jam the signal . Jam the signal . You goddamn retards ! Working on it . When I think it ... You fucking do it . Look at this knife . Imagine me sticking it into your gut . Think about it . Make it real . Oops . Yes ! Yes ! Yeah ! Are you okay ? Are you my daddy , Tillman ? I 'm your daddy . Wait . Shut it off . Pardon ? The nanex . It means nothing to you . It 's just a mouse click . Set us free . Well played , Kable .

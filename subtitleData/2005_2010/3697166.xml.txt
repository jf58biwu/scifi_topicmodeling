 [ engine turning over ] [ beeping ] Shit . There 's an immobilizer . Someone doesn 't want us to leave . Oh , man . I 've got a bad feeling about this . You 're not going to believe this shit . They 've got one in my truck too . Well , now what ? What now is , we wait for Bravo unit , then we all walk out of here together . [ panting ] [ heavy breathing ] Victor ! Victor ! Victor ! [ gasping ] [ grunting ] It 's not gonna work . Don 't sweat it . Stay sharp , fellas . Contact , ten o 'clock ! Victor ! Victor ! Victor ! Hold your fire ! Calm down . What 's going on out there ? What 's the damage ? We got hit hard . There are no other survivors . Continue to base , find Chernov and tell her what 's happened . Get backup . Got it ? - We got slaughtered . - Got it ? - Yes , sir . - Get moving ! Hit the lights ! Positions on the Humvee . [ heavy breathing ] [ metal crunching ] Fire ! [ yelling ] Cease fire ! Cease fire ! Is that it ? Is that all you 've got ! ? [ heavy breathing ] [ panting ] [ screaming ] Chernov ! Chernov ! We need help ! Chernov ! [ heavy panting ] [ gasping ] That was the last one , Dr. Krieger . Outstanding . Absolutely outstanding . Where are the whales , Jack ? This is a whale watching tour , right ? Well , that 's funny , because we scheduled them to breach over our boat exactly at 2 : 45 and ... You promised me whales , George . You hear that ? You go get us some whales or you get us our money back . I told you , we don 't guarantee you see any whales . You get your three hours out like everyone else and take your chances . Oh , we 're staying out here until we see some whales . You might be , but this boat 's going to be back in the harbor at the three hour mark exactly . What 's that accent ? You 're German , right ? Well , let me tell you something about American customer service . We 're staying out . OK . Can you come over here ? Can you hold on to this for a sec ? Where are you going ? Anybody want some beer ? George , what are you doing driving ? What ? Hey , and , um ... Watch out for those rocks . They 're pretty sharp and big . All right , Jack . Take us back . But , George , what about the whales ? You wanna see a damn whale , you drive the boat - [ woman ] George ! - [ George ] This was your idea . [ woman ] Oh , this was not my idea . You blame everything on me ! [ George ] You 're the one who bought that picture-book stuff with whales on it for Christmas . You gave it to me , but you wanted it for yourself . [ woman ] You blame everything on me . You couldn 't stop - talking about the whales . - [ George ] You made us sign up for Greenpeace . Chernov . Good work last night , Katia . Thank you , doctor . And they were some of your best men . The best money can buy . Doctor , why wasn 't I informed about the maneuvers outside the perimeter ? Because it was part of research . Anything that takes place outside on this island is a security matter that concerns me . Captain , I didn 't want to trouble you . I knew how you would feel about testing . Testing ? Yes . Our subject engaged live targets . You mean you tested him on my men ? One unarmed , genetically modified soldier eliminated ten heavy-armed men . This is , um ... This is way beyond anything the command would authorize . Captain , they 're not even your men . They 're Chernov 's people . All of those genetically modified soldiers , or whatever you want to call those creatures , were all once human . Yes , that 's right . And now , if you would excuse me , I have to finish my painting . Chernov , is he back in his holding pen ? Yes . The time-released tranquilizer worked perfectly . Good . You know , if Parker wants to get that much involved , why don 't you have him and his men clean up all the mess ? I 'm not sure how much more of this I can stomach . You mean having that hard-ass bitch as your boss ? You know well enough what I mean . Yeah , well I have my orders , but you have a choice , Max . Why don 't you just leave ? I keep thinking I can do more good by staying . We 'll see . Not much of a killer instinct for a soldier . Yeah , well maybe he 'll send you out there next time . [ man ] Don 't you think it 's a little farfetched ? Genetically modified soldiers ? I 've got it from a good source . Nice . It looks like something from your Sasquatch file . Very funny . It 's a surveillance photo taken outside Krieger 's research facility . I don 't need to tell you how much trouble you can get into snooping around military affairs , do I ? That 's the thing . All my usual sources say there 's no official military installation on that island . This is from another source . Gorgeous shot of a lumber mill . Who are these guys here ? OK , so maybe it 's super covert . That 's all the more reason not to go snooping around . Paul , Krieger has been known to perform genetic experiments on humans . Now he resurfaces on an island secured by soldiers . Valerie , I trust your intuition , but I am not going to have you follow up on this lead . Do you understand ? Fine , I 'll do it on my own time . What time ? You work 14 hours a day on this paper . I 'll take some vacation then . You ? Vacation ? I must have a few weeks banked , right ? Why are you so determined to follow this lead ? Because it 's too good of a story to pass up . [ man ] Paul ? Besides , I 've got a personal interest . General . General . Doctor . I assume you 've got something interesting to show me . See for yourself . Parker ? Please . Please . As you can see , General , your money was put to good use . Doctor , I could give a shit about fancy facilities . What I care about is your results . I 'm positive that you 'll be satisfied . We 'll see about that . See for yourself . He looks fit . We have ten holding cells . And now I have to show you something really incredible . Here 's one we took the liberty of field testing ourselves . Chernov , the gun . Shoot him . - Shoot him ? - Yes , but be careful . Not , uh ... Not in the eyes and not the mouth . Here . Subcutaneous armor ? The skin itself , 20 times more resistant to puncture than Kevlar . His muscles absorb the blows and cover his organs . Let him loose . Let 's see how he moves . I cannot do that without sedating him . He would kill everybody in this room including me . Are you saying that you can 't control him ? I control him , but I have to work on ... What good is that , a weapon that we can 't control ? You can use him under certain circumstances ... That 's not what we commissioned from you , doctor . You asked me to create an invincible soldier . That 's what I 'm presenting to you today . Basically bulletproof , no need for sleep , and he can fight harder and longer than any human soldier . A soldier ? You 're making brainless monsters ! [ screaming ] Sedate him ! More ! If he can 't take orders , then he 's no better than a vicious animal . With some more time and some more money ... No more funding until you produce something that we can use . Chernov . Working late , Max ? [ ¶ Robert Beld : I Only Want to See Your Smile ] [ Valerie ] Hey , Uncle Max , it 's me . I thought I 'd leave you a voice mail in case you were picking up messages . I responded to your email , but I never heard back . Just wanted to check if we were still meeting at that spot that you sent me . Anyways , I 'm heading up now , so I 'll see you soon . Â ¶ We 'll be crying out loud Â ¶ Â ¶ Laughing and shouting Â ¶ Â ¶ I only want to see your smile Â ¶ Hi , this is Valerie Cardinal calling . I 'm calling to confirm that you were able to get that boat captain that I requested , Jack Carver . That 's right . Terrific . I 'll be up there in a few hours . Thanks . See you soon . - Ralph ? - [ man ] What ? You made sure to tell Jack about the client today , right ? - He knows . - He should be on the dock , fueling up and preparing by now . I thought I saw him go in to the Golden Spruce last night . That wouldn 't be too unlike him . [ chuckling ] His boat is just sitting out over there . Do you see him on deck ? [ sighing ] No , pet , I don 't . Which means he 's probably sleeping it off . He could be . Well , aren 't you going to go get him up ? Hey , look , he 'll be here . I 'm not having a captain that represents us showing up unshaven and hung-over for a client ! Get him up ! Yes , pet . Medusa , Medusa , this is Day Beacon , over . Medusa , Medusa , wakey-wakey . This is Day Beacon , over . Shit . [ beeping ] [ Krieger exhaling ] Turn his head . Slowly , slowly . Max , can you hear me ? - Camera 's working . - [ man ] Yes , sir , it is . Max , can you hear me ? Light . Max ? What color ? Red . Good . And now ? Green . Perfect . Perfect . Take the light . Max ? Max , I think you 're going to earn us the rest of our funding . [ laughing ] Good , good , good , good . Stitch him up . [ man ] Yes , doctor . She 'll be here soon . Maybe you should take the skiff out and check in on him . You know he doesn 't like people dropping in on him . Ralph , you 're his boss . Well , technically , he 's a contractor . What ? Are you scared of him ? Pet ... You know , you 've heard all the stories . That 's exactly what they are , stories . Special Army , my ass . He 's a drunk . Just because he drinks doesn 't mean he 's a drunk . It 's Special Forces , pet , not Special Army . Whatever . If you 're not gonna do anything , I will . I 'm gonna go get my gun . [ sighing ] Menopause . [ air rifle firing ] [ exhaling ] Reload . I don 't think you should be playing with him like this . Well , if he 's as tough as you all think he is , he should be able to handle a little shooting . Someone could get hurt . I mean , you could take out an eye or something . [ bell ringing ] Ha ! Special Army , my ass . Hi . Is this Day Beacon Boat Charters ? Yes it is and , uh , you must be Valerie . Hi . I hope I won 't be needing one of those where I 'm going . Hey , we 've got some paperwork to do . Come on in . Â ¶ It 's a bright new day Â ¶ Â ¶ And I love you to come Â ¶ Â ¶ Look at a shining sun Â ¶ Â ¶ Is it always raining at your side Â ¶ Â ¶ I bet you 're having fun Â ¶ Â ¶ We 'll be crying out loud Â ¶ Â ¶ Laughing and shouting Â ¶ Â ¶ I only want to see your smile Â ¶ Â ¶ We 'll be crying out loud Â ¶ Â ¶ Laughing and shouting Â ¶ Â ¶ Our love will never run out Â ¶ [ Jack ] Keep flipping those , will ya ? I didn 't realize the tour came with a meal . We head straight back after lunch . How much to charter your boat for the night ? For the night ? We are not that kind of operation . You chartered me for six hours , OK ? Jack , did you serve in Germany with a man by the name of Max Cardinal ? Who said I was in the services ? Max is my uncle . Very sorry , but I don 't know anyone by that name . He said he was really glad to run into you after he came out here . Did he ? I really don 't know the guy you 're talking about . Tischtennis . What ? That was your safe word . Tischtennis . So you 're his niece , huh ? That would make you the hotshot reporter . [ laughing ] I prefer journalist . Right . What brings you out here ? I 'm meeting with Max . - Where , on that island ? - Yeah . That island 's off limits to the public . Everyone around here knows to stay well away from it . - They 're expecting me . - Right . That 's why you chartered your own boat for a little night landing , huh ? It 's a personal visit . Are you going to take me or not ? No I won 't . Max would understand why . - Did Max tell you what they 're doing over there ? - No . You 're not curious ? I 'm curious how that fish is going to turn out . It 's almost done . I think Max might be in trouble . That man is perfectly capable of taking care of himself . He set up this meeting . He sent me a message and I haven 't heard from him since . He found out that his client was doing something that he didn 't like . Your uncle doesn 't like things , he 'd quit . I asked him to stay on . You 're writing a little story , huh ? [ chuckles ] That money will buy you exactly a ride to the island and back . That 's it . So much for camaraderie between soldiers . - Hey , your fish is cooked . - Let 's see . This is burnt . - They 're crispy . - Crispy ? Ugh . No sign of anyone . Max wanted me to meet him up on the landing , in the woods . Why didn 't he want to meet you up on the pier ? I don 't know . Like I said , all I got was the last message . Wanna come with me ? No . I can take you to the shore , but that 's about it . - OK . - You sure you wanna go ? Yeah . Max is waiting for me . Fine . - I can take you back . - No . Let 's go . [ knuckles cracking ] - Here , take this . - Thank you . I 'm giving you exactly six hours . You better be here when I get back . [ mocking ] You better be here when I get back . Max ? Max ? Max ! [ man ] Miss Cardinal , welcome to the party . Let 's go . - [ man ] Get rid of the boat . - My pleasure . You 're late . - [ can opening ] - [ soft music playing ] Check for bodies . I hope you didn 't leave anything important on that boat . You just killed a man . I 'd be more concerned about yourself . - What have you done with Max ? - You 'll see him soon enough . [ man ] I don 't know why we 're bothering . The guy 's dead . Bitch . You go that way . I 'll check over here . - Chernov . - Doctor ? We have her . - [ Krieger ] Good . - [ Chernov ] I 'm checking for survivors . I 'll be back with the reporter shortly . [ grunting ] [ grunting ] [ Chernov ] Russell . Russell ! Where are those guys ? [ rock striking ground ] Check the wood line , nine o 'clock . [ men shouting ] [ Chernov ] We 've lost contact with Russell and Kyle . Send a backup team . [ man ] 10-4 . Backup team on the way . [ men shouting ] [ Chernov ] After them ! Go ! [ man ] Get out of the way ! Let 's go ! [ Valerie ] I 'm handcuffed . [ Jack ] Wait a second . Universal handcuff key . Where 'd you get that ? Never leave home without one . Turn around . [ Valerie ] Uh-oh . Here they come . Stop them ! - Here , do it yourself . - Great . Thanks . [ Jack ] Are you OK ? [ Valerie screaming ] [ Valerie ] Oh , sure , I 'm great . [ gun clicking ] [ Valerie yelling ] Come on ! [ Chernov ] Keep going ! Got it ! - [ Valerie ] No kidding ! - [ Jack groaning ] [ Valerie ] Holy shit ! How about pitching in a little ? - I 'm trying ! - Try harder , please . Nice . Good one . Well ? What are these ? Oh , that 's sweet . It 's called a hand grenade . Try throwing one . - It didn 't work . - Did you pull the pin ? They 're useless with the pin . [ Jack ] Hurry up ! - Did you throw it ? - Uh , yeah . [ Valerie ] Whoo ! Yeah . - What 's happening ? - Oh no . Please tell me you have something else back there . I 'm trying . Hey , what 's this thing ? [ Jack ] What the hell was that ? - I don 't know . - What do you mean you don 't know ? Look out ! You 've gotta be kidding me . Come on . Come on ! Start the search . I want confirmation they 're dead . [ Jack whispering ] Let 's go inside . Are you hurt ? You 've been shot . That 's just a scratch . You better get out of those wet clothes . - Huh ? - OK . Turn around . OK , you can turn around now . Thanks . I told you Max was in trouble . It 's my fault he stayed , though . I convinced him I could take the story public . It was his decision to stay . What do we do now ? That 's easy . Get off this island . I told you , I 'm not leaving without finding Max . You can get us into the mill to look for him . No . You hired me as a water captain . Shore excursions aren 't part of the deal . [ shivering ] Don 't you ever think about anybody ... except yourself and money ? Did I mention you owe me a boat ? [ exhaling ] It 's cold . I think I 'm getting hypothermic . Can I come in ? OK . Good . I have to take off my wet pants , you know . Turn around . [ both shivering ] This bed 's very uncomfortable . Itchy . Sorry , the Hyatt was booked out . - It 's cold . - Yeah . You know what we used to do in the military ? No . What ? [ shivering ] It was called " shared body heat . " Hmm , like spooning ? You could say so . OK . Much better . Is that your gun ? [ chuckling ] Well , I never go to bed without it . One second . Gone . So , how was I ? [ sighing ] Where are we headed ? There 's a dock by the mill on the other side of the island . We 're going to grab a boat there . I told you , I 'm not leaving without Max . Don 't start again . We 're gonna get a boat and leave this island . You didn 't answer my question . What do you mean ? What do I mean ? On a scale from one to ten , how would you rate me ? Two . Two ? A two ? - What ? - Huh ! [ vehicle approaching ] Am I seeing this ? [ man ] I 'm gonna check it out . [ engine shuts off ] Get your hands up . [ grunting ] Get ' em up . You 're coming back to base camp . Undress . I wasn 't talking to you . I was talking to her . You wish , huh ? I was kidding . Keep going . I was really only a two ? OK , a three . [ whispering ] Hat . [ muffled shouting ] Over here . Parker , we need two of your trucks . Yeah ? Well I heard what happened last night . Why don 't you leave island security to us and you just stick to what you 're good at , whatever that is ? Just give me those trucks . - I need a word with you . - Oh . Being cannon fodder for mutants was never part of the deal and there have been a lot of us dying lately . We compensate you well enough , so you 'll whatever we tell you to do . And if we 're dead , you won 't have to pay us at all . You don 't like it you can leave . Yeah ? Well I 'll take what I know with me . You 'll be sorry for this . Any more complaints ? [ Jack ] Come on . It 's clear . - Ow . - You 're my prisoner . [ whispering ] OK . Inside . You wait here . I 'll get us a boat . I told you , I 'm not going . Your ride is leaving now , whether you 're on it or not . - I mean it . - Not without Max . I 'm going to bring the boat here and you better be here when I 'm back . [ mocking ] You better be here when I 'm back . Dr. Krieger , you might want to see this . Look at this . - Is that her ? - Yes . I thought she was dead . She soon will be . Chernov ? I want to speak to her . Yes , sir . Up . [ grunting ] Take her to the cell until the doctor 's ready . Why couldn 't they load this up on the main dock , huh ? Tell me that . Then we could have used the forklift . Now we have to hump all these ourselves . This is ridiculous ! Ow ! Oh , my back . Oh , my back . I think I compressed a disc . Forget this . I 'm taking a break . Oh . Oh ! [ sighing ] I wouldn 't be sitting down if I were you . You don 't want the commandant to catch you . Come on . What ? What the hell do I care ? Because of that ... that tight-ass ? What , am I a soldier ? Is he the boss of me ? No ! - Whatever , man . - Whatever , man . Oh , shit ! I 've been thinking about you all day , all day . [ inhaling ] [ moaning ] That 's good . [ choking ] Are you OK ? Oh , my God . Oh , my back ! My back ! Oh ! [ hacking ] I was a goner . Oh , my God . You saved my life ! You saved my life ! Oh , my God . I was ... It 's OK ! Shh . Who the hell are you ? What are you doing , sneaking up on me like that ? Hey ! What are you two doing ? Who are you ? Answer me . I said who are you ? [ stammering ] I 'm the food guy . I 'm the food guy . I came for a friend , one of yours . - Who ? - Max Cardinal . He 's a good man , but he 's gone . What do you mean , " He 's gone ? " He got caught spying and he 's as good as dead . - Get back . - [ grunting ] Ooh , my back ! Oh , my back ! Get him off the boat ! Hey , there 's someone down here ! He 's got Parker ! Oh , my God ! Where are we going ? [ yelling ] [ screaming ] [ yelping ] [ shrieking ] Keep going ! We got him . Oh no ! [ screaming ] [ whooping ] Halt ! Stop the boat ! What 's your name ? Jack . I 'm Emillio . Nice to meet you . You owe me a meatball sandwich . So , you are the cause of our recent troubles . Tell you what . Replace my boat and we 'll call it even . Who sent you ? [ chuckles ] I 'm just a driver . I see . You 're just a simple boatman . Is that your story ? I haven 't said anything about being simple . Whatever . We have your colleague and I 'm sure she will have much more to say . That 's great . So you won 't be needing me then . That 's correct . I don 't need you , but as you 're here , I may as well use you ... - [ groaning ] - ... to be part of my new experiment . See you then . Well I think that went quite well , don 't you ? He wasn 't looking at me , was he ? He was just talking about you , right ? - [ chuckles ] - [ sighing ] You ... You mind if we sit ? I have a feeling this is going to take a while . Sure . On three . I used to do this in dance camp . One , two , three . Ahh ! Except we weren 't cuffed in dance camp . [ panting ] So , uh ... You ever have anything like this ever happen to you and you get out of the situation or anything remotely like this ? I wanted to die fast , you know , like by a shark . Get up . Take her to Dr. Krieger 's office . [ classical music playing ] Leave us . Sorry about the rough treatment , but these people only know one way to deal with intruders . Sit down . Dr. Krieger , you should know the newspaper is aware I 'm here and will be alerting the authorities . It 's all been taken care of . The coast guard reported you lost at sea . What you don 't know is my bodyguard is on his way to the mainland in a boat . Strange . He told me he was just your driver . You know , if he wouldn 't have turned around , we would have never caught him . Us being without a helicopter these days . You know that you owe me a helicopter . ? Where 's Max ? Looking at you , you don 't look at all like your Uncle Max . I want to see him or I 'm not saying another word . You will see him and you will say another word , when the time has come . Laying the foundation ? Sit down . Go back and sit down . You ever play I-spy ? Nah . You wanna play I-spy ? Yeah , let 's play I-spy . Well , now , all right , we can if you want . Let 's play I-spy . OK . I go first . OK . You got it ? - Yeah . - OK , uh ... . Is it a ... a freaky doctor ? [ both laughing ] My creations . You are looking at the deadliest ground troop ever to walk the planet . Have a look for yourself . You won 't find a more technically advanced facility anywhere in the world . Max ! He can 't hear you . He just finished his treatment . He 's still coming out of his sedation . What have you done to him ? Made him a better soldier than he ever was before . Max is right . You 're a sick , egotistical maniac . Let 's not go over the top . I 'm just greedy . You can 't imagine how much money the government is paying for research like that . How can you live with yourself ? I live fine , thank you . Let 's continue the tour . Jack ! - Are you OK ? - Mm-hm . - Make them pay . - Happy reunions . He turned Max into one of his creatures . We like to refer to them as genetically modified soldiers around here . Your two friends will be undergoing the same process . Your friend Jack has real potential . Did he say " friends ? " Yeah , hi . I don 't know these people . I 've never even seen her before . Then why did you try to help them escape ? Escape ? No , no , no . He hijacked the boat , and then he hijacked me . I don 't like him . I don 't even know him . - Yah ! Yah ! Yah ! - [ swallowing ] My process will be a waste on you . Yeah , that 's right . I 'm covered in flab . What should we do with him , sir ? Well , you just kill him . No. no. no. no . You don 't want to kill me ! I 'll be your personal valet . I can help you in many ways . I 'm the food guy ! Oh , no ! God damn it . Come on ! Will you shut up ? We 've gotta escape . Stop choking , you big baby . God , come on ! Spit it out ! Spit it out ! [ gagging ] - Pick it up . - Pick up what ? - What does it look like ? - Holy tomato ! Where 'd you get that ? Come on . Let me get it . Let me get it . That 's pretty good . That 's very good , buddy . [ gasping ] I got it . OK . OK . Open the cuffs . There it goes . Now I missed it . - You do it . - [ both yelling ] OK . Up like dance camp . - Up like dance camp . - One ! Two ! Three ! [ both groaning ] OK . You do it . I can 't do it . You do it . You got it ? Come on . Just do it . - Where is it ? - It 's right there . Got it ? Ow . Ow . OK , good . Nice . Nice . - Hey , what about me ? - Come on . Let 's see if my work on Max has been successful . Release GMS nine . Yes , doctor . This room is making me claustrophobic . Whatever happens , I got your back you got mine , OK ? Whaaa ! Max . You know this guy ? Oh , Jeez , he looks rough . Good thing he doesn 't know you 're banging his niece . Hey , he used to be a nice guy , OK ? Max ? I don 't know , man . He doesn 't look so nice . If I 've done my job correctly , your Uncle Max won 't rip the arms off your friends yet , unless I give the command . Max , remember me ? I 'm Jack . I 'm gonna let you two sort this out , OK ? Max , execute . Max , no ! Don 't do it . Let 's not get carried away , please . Max , remember me ? I 'm Jack . Remember ? Max ! Max ! Kill them ! [ groaning ] Max . It 's a dead end . Max , tischtennis . Remember ? Tischtennis ? [ yelling ] [ groaning ] There 's Valerie , up there . Max , kill them ! Come on . Come on . What are you doing ? He wised up . Release GMS seven and eight . [ yelling ] [ yelling ] Yah ! [ screaming ] [ whimpering ] [ grunting ] [ alarm blaring ] Ow ! [ yelling ] [ Emillio ] Bad guy ! Bad guy ! [ grunting ] Same team . Same team . That 's it ? That 's your plan , stay here and paint ? - Spread out ! - Yes , sir ! [ grunting ] - [ man ] Can 't get a clean shot ! - [ man 2 ] Right there ! Take him out ! - [ Emillio whimpering ] - [ man screaming ] We still looking for that broad ? [ Emillio ] Holy shit . They must do a lot of humping here , - because those things breed like rabbits . - [ explosion booming ] - Go . - Where are we going ? Run , hide . I 'm just a food guy . Asshole . Everybody , drop down ! Be aware ! Remember , eyes and mouth ! [ screaming ] [ screaming ] Mr. Masaki , it 's Dr. Krieger . I 'm ready to deliver . Are you still interested ? Good . We agree to the terms ? Wonderful . I 'll see you in Shanghai . What day ? See you then . [ phone beeping ] What is it ? Doctor , the perimeter is overrun . We are sustaining heavy casualties . I 'm gonna sound an evacuation . Let 's make one thing clear . You 're holding your position . My men are getting slaughtered . I 'm going to order a fallback . You are not falling back . You are holding your position . Is that clear ? Sir , with all due respect , go shove your civilian orders up your civilian ass . - Cover me ! - [ man screaming ] Chernov ? Doctor . Some problems . Eliminate Parker . Yes , doctor . Um , Chernov ? I need escort to the pier . - Copy that . - [ men shouting ] [ man ] Get back ! Come on ! Sir , Dr. Krieger 's personal boat is readying for launch . Of course . The biggest rat is first off the sinking ship . We sure as hell ain 't gonna cover his retreat . In fact , we get there first , we take his boat . Get all remaining units to rendezvous at rally point Bravo . All units , this is Claw Zero Six . All claw units rendezvous at rally point Bravo . Confirm . Over . [ man on radio ] Copy . Rally point Bravo . Come on . Pull back . Pull back ! We lost him , sir . We 're gonna have to leave him . You are one persistent son of a bitch . Yes I am . Let me pass . We 're leaving . Why don 't you come with us ? Krieger still has my colleague . Well , Krieger 's about to leave . I won 't let him leave with her . I admire your loyalty . Something in short supply around here . But once Krieger gets on that boat , he 's no longer our concern . OK . I 'm going to put my weapon down . How do I find his boat ? Passageway , back the way you came . Follow it , the stairs down to the ground floor and head straight to the far end of the building . Thanks . Wait a second . Your gun 's empty . Take that . Happy hunting . Remember , aim for the eyes or the mouth . Thank you . Parker . Get everyone back to the boats and leave immediately . But , sir . It 's OK . Now move . Where are they going ? They 're withdrawing , on my orders . [ screaming ] Schratter ! Get out ! Parker ! Parker ! [ yelling ] Oh , shit . [ screaming ] [ groaning ] Bitch . [ grunting ] [ grunting ] Chernov . - Chernov . - Yes , sir . What 's going on down there ? I 'm on it . [ Krieger ] I 'm waiting . Give me two minutes . I 'm waiting ! It 's clear . Good . You first . Chernov , let 's go to the boat . [ whistling ] Tell your men to hold exactly where they are . Don 't move . Stay where you are . Let her go . Let the girl go . Chernov , let the girl go ! Gun down . Dream on . Let her go . - [ gasping ] - Gun down . [ panting ] Kill him . [ grunting ] [ screaming ] - [ neck snapping ] - [ grunting ] Max ! Max . [ gasping ] [ Jack ] Let 's go . [ Emillio ] Jack ! Jack ! Jack ! Come on . Come on ! Come on ! Those freaky things are following you . Come on . Let 's go . Can anybody hear me ? [ panting ] Can anybody hear me ? Captain , where 's the boat ? [ Krieger ] You must be joking . Step back ! As my editor expected , we got a visit from the men in black suits . No story can run that compromises national security . So what are you going to do ? I 'll keep working on it . That 's good . So , here she is . Where 'd you get that ? [ chuckles ] Insurance bought it for me . Wait a minute . Is that ... Is that Emillio ? - Yeah . - [ laughing ] [ Jack ] He 's my new deckhand and my cook . A pretty decent cook . Wow . Well , I , um ... I should probably get back to work . [ Jack ] Hey , uh ... The day when you rated me two out of ten you were joking , right ? Do I see you tomorrow ? Yes . [ chuckling ] Two points . She wouldn 't see me if I was only two points . Jack , we got our first customers . That 's great . - Hey , Jack . - I think you owe us some whales , Jack .

 Previously on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ... Where 's the metal ? - Who are you ? - My name 's Winston . I talked to your mom . She found something . It has something to do with those three dots . Is it real this time ? The bullet in her leg sounds real . You stay . I 'll go . You made your call . This is what living with it means . I detected this audio transmission on an unsecured line . Got a breach . Man shot out at Heat and Air . You know the drill . Shut the place down . Authorities are still trying to determine the cause of the blast which killed all 32 employees of the Desert Canyon Heat and Air plant earlier this week . A vigil is scheduled for today in Charm Acres , the high-desert enclave that served as a company town for the workers and their families . Area schools and many of the town 's local businesses will be closed in observance ... Native Americans believe that when their pictures are taken , their souls are stolen and locked in the photograph forever . I think you 're safe . God , I hate funerals . I hate Skynet . How come this sounded so easy when we were talking about it ? And now that I see all these people ... Just find somebody to talk to , John . Mom , everybody who knew anything about the factory is already dead . - Well , I 'm not . - Yeah , well , I guess you 're lucky . I 'd feel luckier if we could find somebody here who knew what was going on out there . You 'd never guess he had it in him . I see it . That seat taken ? Are you gonna say annoying things ? - Annoying things ? - " I can 't believe it 's happening . " " It comes in waves . " " I just feel numb . " No , I will ... try not to say those things . I 'm John . Zoe . So you know somebody in Charm Acres , John ? Or are you just a sucker for a small-town , homey vigil ? My mom worked at the factory . So she ... - You know , came to pay her respects . - So you got dragged along . Little drag , also some push . - It seemed like the right thing to do . - A stupid thing to do , if you had a choice . Did you have a choice ? Funeral crasher . Stupid funeral crasher . Am I crazy , or is that girl creepily staring at us ? That would be my sister . I don 't like that . No , no reason to . That 's my mom . My dad worked at the factory . - Sorry . - I picked out a suit this morning , you know , to bury him in . I picked out a gray one , even tho ' Henry said I should 've picked out a black one . He looked better in gray , though . Speak of the Henry devil . We 're about to do the candle lighting . Hi , I 'm John . Is that your boyfriend ? He keeps applying for the job . I 'm just not hiring . It was nice to meet you ... Do not stand at my grave and weep . I am not there . I do not sleep . I am a thousand winds that blow . I am the diamond glint on snow . I am the sunlight on ripened grain . I am the gentle autumn rain . When you awake in the morning 's hush ... Excuse me . He hated having his picture taken . You wouldn 't know it by looking at him there , but he did . - Excuse me , I 'll leave ... - No , no . It 's ... It 's okay . It 's actually refreshing to see an unfamiliar face . Everybody here ... all I see are the people that they 've lost . All I see is what 's missing . I 'm Sarah . Diana Winston . So did you know my husband , Sarah ? Episode 2x15 : Desert Cantos V 1.00 Gene used to project old movies on his garage door . Every Saturday night during the summer , there 'd be couples out in the driveway with their beers and popcorn ... watching Casablanca or Out of the Past or His Girl Friday . I just went for the free beer . I 've been to a lot of places for that . I can 't remember ... the last movie that Ed and I saw together ... Or when . I used to just leave his dinner in the fridge for whenever he came home . It wasn 't the easiest place to work . I was only there for a few months , but long enough to figure that out . I can 't tell you how many times I wanted to ... make a call or write a letter to those people and ask them what kind of security they had Ed doing that kept him out of the house seven days a week . - But you never do that . - No one does that . Not here . Yes , ma 'am . - Do you have him , Mr. Walsh ? - No , ma 'am . He 's proven a ... bit harder to locate than I had anticipated . You assured me it 'd be a very simple job . I know . Everyone I 've spoken to thinks that he 's dead , died in the explosion at the factory . I can tell you he isn 't . - He didn 't . - I 've got a good lead on him , ma 'am . I hope so , Mr. Walsh . I must 've missed the memo about wearing plaid today . Don 't worry . It 's not a company policy . It 's just something a few of us do . Paying homage , you know ? To whom ? Weaver , Lachlan Weaver . Today 's the anniversary of his death . - Did you know him ? - Yeah , he was ... He was a great guy . You know , he 's a genius , funny as hell . They both were , you know , back then . Good morning , Mr. Ellison . Mr. Murch . Ms. Weaver . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? I 'm going to say a few words about my friend Gene Miller . But before I do , I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Desert Heat and Air 's parent company , the Kaliba group , for their generous donations to this service , and not just for the beautiful flowers you see around our chapel , but also for the generosity and kindness they 've extended to the families in this very difficult time . Is this all it costs to buy us ? Flowers and a few kind words ? Where 's anybody from the company ? Have any of you seen anybody from the company ? Has anybody ever seen anybody from the company ? No . You have not . - Diana . - Stop . Let us pray . Let us pray . First six years of our marriage , we lived in nine states . Ed was in the military , so ... When he got the chance to settle down ... You know , the nice company car , the big house , the even bigger salary ... I pushed him to take that job . Head of security for Desert Canyon Heat and Air . Come on , what kind of heat and air factory needs that kind of security ? What did you do there ? Me ? Coffee and sandwich cart ... Waitress on wheels . - I never knew what went on there . - No one does . Ed never said a damn thing about it , and every time I 'd ask , he 'd shut me down , so I stopped asking . We all did . None of this is your fault . Ed was a decent man . Whatever went on there , he was a decent man . Decent people can get caught up in things . I found these when I was going through Ed 's things . I 've never seen them before in my life . This one goes to a storage locker . You don 't have a storage locker , do you ? No . I 've been meaning to go there , but then I get scared . So I tell myself some doors are better left unopened . Not this one . Looks like you could use a lift . - What 's that ? - A lift . You want one ? - Oh , yeah , sure . - Yeah . Great . Thanks . Appreciate it . Condolences . It 's not my funeral , but thanks . I 'm an OSHA investigator . I 'm looking into the explosion . Big change from being a cop . Yeah . 23 years , Baltimore , 4th precinct , Pikesville . You a local ? My wife worked up at the plant . She knew a lot of these people . My condolences . - So what do you think ? - About what ? What happened . I think it 's too early to tell . - Would you even if you knew ? - Tell ? - Yeah . - No . You know , people say it wasn 't an accident . Is that right ? They say something was going on up there other than heating and air-conditioning . - Something as in what exactly ? - That 's what I 'm asking you . Suppose you knew something was going on out there . What would you do ? Absolutely nothing . - Absolutely nothing ? - That 's what I said . - Thanks for the ride . - No problem . - I 'm gonna walk the rest of the way . - No problem . Good luck with your investigation . Empty . Empty . I did not know that man . I loved him , but I didn 't know him . Sometimes that 's for the best . He called me . Ed did , three days ago , for the last time . He must 've dialed by accident . My name 's Winston . I install air-conditioning , all right ? Please don 't hurt me . I have a wife . What happened to him , Sarah ? I can 't die here . Somebody tell me I 'm not gonna die here . You won 't die here . I hate these people . I don 't relate to any of them . Great . Thanks , Zoe . Hey , what if we just kept driving ? Got on the highway and didn 't stop till we hit somewhere amazing ? The Grand Canyon . I went there when I was a kid . My mom and I took mules down into the canyon . - Sounds cool . - It would 've been if my mule wasn 't completely schizo . He ate my spare shirt . I 've never been . Got a postcard from there once . Okay , seriously , if you start talking about Mike Thompson , I 'm getting out of the car . - Boyfriend ? - Ex . And he was a good guy ... Until he ditched me . - What happened ? - He was just like the rest of us . His mom worked at the plant . Mike was just a normal , funny guy . He liked watching Monty Python movies and playing lacrosse . - What happened to him ? - Apparently , his mom had violated some confidentiality agreement or something at the plant . They just ... up and left in the middle of the night . Mike never said a word about it . I woke up one morning , and he was just gone . A few months later I got a postcard - from the Grand Canyon . - He was a real prize . Shut up , Henry . Why don 't you think about somebody besides yourself for once , huh ? You 're not the only person who 's lost someone . Zoe 's not in love with you . What ? She doesn 't love you the way you love her . - Get out of the car . - What ? I want them out ! Henry , just go ! Go ! - Are you gonna go ? - No . - What are you ... What are you doing ? ! - Get out . - Make a right over here . - What the hell is going on ? I can 't deal with another funeral , Henry , not right now . Hey , do you want to see something really messed up ? One day you 'll be out here , and they 're lying there like that , dead . And the next day they 're gone . Like Mike . Yeah , like Mike . What 's killing them ? Idiots with guns . No bullet wounds . What are you , Dr. Quinn medicine woman ? Maybe it 's the water . You 'd think people would 've picked up on that . They always did want to be rich . That 's what Henry said . His mom wanted the good things . Careful what you wish for , huh ? What do you mean ? Insurance money ... The company 's agreed to pay . We 're all rich . What did Henry 's father do at the plant anyway ? He went to work in the morning , came home , didn 't talk about it . Same as everybody else that worked there . I don 't get it . What 's so secret about heating and air-conditioning ? The secret is , is it wasn 't heating and air-conditioning . What was it ? Some kind of government project . That 's what I think . There 's some smart people around here , real smart . So you think what ... That somebody sabotaged the plant and killed all these people ? Your father ? It wasn 't an accident , John . The guy who shot me is either a serial killer or a true believer . His wife thinks he was murdered . She 's right . But nothing about the thing you think you saw ? The drone or whatever ? I don 't think I saw it . I saw it . Who 's he ? Looking for something . The best way to find out what it is , is to let him find it . He made you . He 'll try and lose you , but he doesn 't know me . I 'll handle it . You always do . Skynet 's here , Reese . I can feel it . What ? You called me " Reese " again . That 's what you used to call him , isn 't it ? You know , maybe you should try to let him go . Maybe you should . Is Henry gonna be okay ? Henry smokes a lot of weed . You know , my father died before I was even born . Yeah , well , my father 's a pile of ashes somewhere , so I guess we 're both screwed . I thought you picked out a gray suit to bury him in . Why am I even talking to you ? You don 't know me . You don 't know what I 'm going through . Stop trying to make it seem like you 're some kind of sensitivity expert . You don 't know anything . She 's not crying . She 's not doing a lot of things . Come in . You 've changed your tie . Is that plaid ? Yes , I went home at lunch . I hope you don 't mind . I spoke to Mr. Murch , and he spoke of ... Lachlan 's death . My sympathies . Thank you . I remember when my father died . He was ... He was a tough man . We didn 't get along . Even so , it took me a long time to come to terms with his passing . I threw myself into work so I wouldn 't have to . Was this recent ? Recent enough . - Then you understand . - I do . So how 's Savannah doing with this ? Do ? How is she dealing with her father 's death ? Dr. Sherman was very helpful in that regard . Now he 's gone , too . Children are nothing if not resilient . I 'm surprised she 's not here . Why ? Being the anniversary , I mean . I guess that is surprising . Dr. Sherman felt it was important to maintain a regular routine . Today 's not the day for excitement . Would you excuse me , Mr. Ellison ? I 'm feeling emotional . Of course . Find my daughter and bring her to me . You know , there are times , and I 'd have to say this is one of them , where it seems every single logical step we take leads to the most bizarre place . You mean crashing that poor guy 's wake and eating his widow 's shrimp skewers ? Yeah , I mean that . - What 's the point ? - You know what the point is . Your mom thinks that factory was linked to Skynet . Yeah , and you think she 's nuts . Doesn 't mean I think she 's wrong . She hasn 't looked at her father 's picture since we 've been here ... Not once . Neither has her mother . Yeah , and ? If you had a photo of Kyle Reese , you 'd look at it , wouldn 't you ? Maybe there 's something I don 't understand . He 's not dead . That 's a big leap . Let me repeat . If you had a photo of your brother , would you or would you not look at it ? He 's not dead . We should find him before he is . What are you doing in my parents ' room ? Your father 's alive , isn 't he ? Get out . Let me go ! You 're scared , you wanna protect him , but you don 't know what 's been going on . Get away from me ! - Let me help you . - You can 't . Yes , I can . Where are you ? - In a garage . - Garage , where ? It 's a long story . Where are you ? We 're at a wake ... A fake wake . The whole place was wired , every house in the neighborhood . Every move anyone ever made was being watched . Skynet work camp . This is how they were set up . People working for the machines monitored by other people working for the machines . Who are you people ? What were they building in that plant ? Who owned it ? I need to know right now . I don 't ... How would I know ? The tunnel led to your garage . My husband 's garage . Look , we don 't know you people . You could be responsible for this . - You could be some terrorists . - We are some kind of terrorists . If someone hadn 't blown up that plant , I would . Now , where 's your husband ? He 's dead . No , he 's not dead ... Yet . Wait , wait . Please , he 's innocent . - He is . John , you have to believe me . - No , I don 't have to . When he knew everyone was dead , he was freaked out . He was trying to figure out what to do , and he didn 't know what to do . He was scared , like we are . What were they building at the plant ? - Nobody knows . - How can you not know ? How can any of you not know ? How can you sleepwalk through your lives ? Tell us what they were building at the plant . Just stop it ! He told us he was gonna play dead ! He told us everybody else had died , that he should 've died , and that it would be better if that 's what everybody thought ! You think I 'm sad , that I am pathetic , that I what ... That I just sleepwalked my way through all of this . Maybe you 're right . Maybe I looked the other way . We all did , every one of us . You may not think that 's you would do , but that is what most people do . You don 't owe them this . So there 's not plant now , no plant , no Charm Acres . But it is a lot of insurance money , enough for my family to get lost and start over . So I didn 't ask any questions . Why would I start now when we are so close ? Look at this . I pulled this from the archives . Daddy ? You may not like asking questions , but me , once I get started , I can 't stop . Mom . I think I know where he might be . Excuse me . I 've been watching you . You want to know what I see ? - What do you see , Diana ? - Ed would say you don 't smell right . Well , I guess Ed would know . Look , I deserve the truth . I opened up to you . Sometimes it 's better not to ask too many questions . You 're crying . Yes , you are . Come here . I want to tell you something . I remember when my father died . He was a tough man . We didn 't get along . Even so ... It took me a long time to come to terms with his passing . Do you understand what I 'm I miss daddy . What do you miss about him ? He used to read me stories . I can read you a story . He did it better . You know ... Anytime you want to see your father , we have videos . It 's not the same . Why ? I can 't sit on his lap . Come , sit on my lap . Your lap is cold . I know . Where are we , John ? What is this place ? I don 't know .

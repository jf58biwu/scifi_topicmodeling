 On weekends we would all go for a drive . Two years ago my life was a happy one . But now this is my reason for living . Sword and Firearms Law Repealed Capital City Non-Functional Tokyo a Wind-Swept Desert Lawless City Yokohama in 20XX HARD REVENGE MILLY Coffee . You 're new around here . Being here on your own could be dangerous . I need something sharpened . I don 't know how you found me , but I 'm retired . I 'm not in that business anymore . You 're the only one who can do it , Jubei . I haven 't heard that name for a long time . I gave this sword to Master Kato . Have you mastered this killer sword ? I 'll have no part in murder . The coffee is on me . Dink it and leave . I 've seen too much blood in my life . Way too much . Enough blood to make me sick . Deadly feuds go nowhere . If someone doesn 't break off , they go on forever . I 'm fighting the Jack Brothers . Which one of them ? All of them . Is this a death wish ? I 'm as good as dead . Is this all you want sharpened ? Better fix that leg if you want to beat the Brothers . It 's been years ... No , it 's over a decade . How 's your leg ? Sometimes it creaks . But I can still do a roundhouse kick . Do you have shells ? No , I used them all . You 're lucky . I have some to spare . Thanks . This really needs to be re-smelted . A sword is a living creature . It must be re-sharpened every time it 's used to kill . 'Momantai ' means no problems . I 'll finish up and head to your place . If I do get caught , I 'll give your name , brother . Here comes another stooge . More big money on the way . What a surprise . I didn 't expect a woman . This is far too much for one addict . Youre planning on dealing this dope ? Or are you just a full-on crackhead ? We should hook up . Be my bitch and you can have all the shit you want . You don 't even remember me . Compose message Jack Brothers Sending That 's not funny , Kyoshiro . Kyoshiro is dead . Who 's this ? You 're full of shit . We 're down on Honmoku wharf , come see for yourself . Did you off him ? He was a pussy . Are you the one who 's been offing my guys recently ? They were all pussies . So who the fuck are you ? I 'm Milly . You massacred my family . I hope that 's not Kyoshiro . Some babe called Milly actually did this ? That 's what Jack said . Who is this Milly , anyway ? Who knows ? If this is some bitch-fight , count me out . She 's most likely some babe you raped . You 're probably right . How the fuck can I remember every piece of ass ? Man , you go too far . I can 't help it . It 's " youthful impetuosity . " Lmpetuosity ? You are way sicko . Cool it . She wants us to go up . It 's like a game . Here we go . I don 't get it , what is 'youthful impetuosity ' anyway ? Just shut the fuck up for a while . You 're pissing me off . And I 'm starving . You mean it ? I 'm hungry , too . I 've been hungry since I got here . That is like so weird . Barbecued Kyoshiro has given me an appetite . I don 't believe this shit . That 's cool . It 's made me hungry , too . Really ? That 's a relief . I thought I 'd gone whacko . You probably are whacko , but your nose is normal . We should try a slice of Kyoshiro . For sure . That would be so out there . But don 't tell Jack his brother looks tasty . He 'd rip you to pieces and cut your friggin ' head off . Yuma , get your ass out of there now . This is bad , Jack . I remember her . It 's that bitch you cut up 2 years ago . The one who bit off your face . You were pissed because I fried your husband and your baby . My face still aches . I didn 't think you 'd survive . Any scars from where I cut your tits off ? I 'd love to see them again . Hold up there ! Wait ! Just wait . Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! I remember when we last met . I 'll take time to slice you up today . I have one question . Why did you choose us ? The same reason we breathe . You don 't even notice . You just suck air . We had no reason to kill your family . You happened to be there , when we felt like killing someone . Hell begins here . Even if I took revenge , I found no peace . I 've lost my purpose to keep on living . My hell starts right now . Written Directed by Takanori Tsujimoto Milly , I 'll kill you next .

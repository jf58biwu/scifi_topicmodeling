 This programme contains some strong language . Torchwood . Outside the government , beyond the police . Tracking down alien life on earth , arming the human race against the future . The 21st century is when everything changes and you 've got to be ready . MOBILE RINGS Dad ? I dunno , hour and half , tops . I 'll be there soon as I can . I can 't hear you . The signal 's going . Hello ? Are you all right ? Come on ! CLATTERING METAL SCRAPES Leave me alone ! BANG SHE SCREAMS SCREAMING CONTINUES I hate the countryside . It 's dirty , it 's unhygienic . And what is that smell ? That would be grass . It 's disgusting . Seventeen disappearances within the last five months . Police are clueless . Now there 's a surprise . No offence , PC Cooper . The last known whereabouts of each one is somewhere around here . All within a 20-mile radius . Anything else linking them ? None of the bodies have ever been found . These people just fell off the radar . No patterns in age , sex , race . One minute they 're here , the next ... boof . Gone . The rift doesn 't spread out this far . Does it ? We don 't know that much about it to be certain . And it 's increasing in activity all the time . Come on , aliens aren 't gonna bother hanging around out here . Probably some sort of weird suicide club with people choosing the same spot to end it all . God knows , if I had to spend too long up here , I 'd want to top myself . Here you go . Careful , they 're hot . Sure you don 't want anything , Tosh ? Really sure . A friend of mine caught hepatitis off a burger from one of these places . We 'll start with the most recent victim , Ellie Johnson . We last have record of her making a phone call . She dropped out of signal mid-call . The coverage map has her placed ... somewhere about here . Looks as good a place as any to set up camp . Sorry , did you say camp ? What 's the matter with a hotel ? People are going missing round here . D 'you really wanna stay in a place run by strangers ? Cos sleeping outside is a lot safer ( ! ) No other race in the universe goes camping . Celebrate your own uniqueness . What am I supposed to do with this ? Need a hand getting it up , Owen ? If I did , I wouldn 't ask you . Some pieces are missing ! No . I checked . HEAVY BREATHING Oh , come on ! It 's just a bit of fun ! Who was the last person you snogged ? See ! You even sound like an eight-year-old ! Who the hell says " snog " ? Mine was ... Rhys ! Yeah , well , there 's a surprise . Tosh , your go . It 's easy for you ! Oh , come on ! Spill the beans ! Owen . What ? Really ? Tosh , in your dreams . 3am , Christmas Eve , in front of the Millennium Centre . Waiting for a cab . I had mistletoe . Christmas ? ! You 've not had a snog since . No . Well . Lucky me , eh ? So who was yours ? Gwen , actually . When was this ? It was complicated . Didn 't take you long to get your feet under the table . What ? So was it just a kiss , or ... Tosh , leave it . Jack ? Are we including non-human lifeforms ? Oh , you haven 't ! You 're a sick man , Harkness ! That is disgusting ! I never know when he 's joking . It 's my turn , is it ? It was Lisa . Ianto , I 'm sorry ... Sorry she 's dead ? Or sorry you mentioned it ? I just didn 't think . You forgot . We should get some firewood . I 'll give you a hand . Couldn 't you have kept that to yourself ? What 's the matter , you embarrassed ? You 're such an arrogant shit sometimes , Owen ! That was a good kiss . It was borderline great . So good , you 've been avoiding me ever since . Country air 's making you delusional . How long did it last ? Ten seconds ? But the things I can tell from that kiss . Oh , like ? Like your sex life ain 't up to much . You what ? ! Y 'see old Rhys makes the earth rumble , but he don 't make it move , does he ? You might want to shut up before I lamp you one . When was the last time you screwed all night ? When was the last time you came so hard , and so long , you forgot where you are ? Doesn 't happen with him , does it ? You 're too familiar . Whereas , you and me , we 're not cosy at all . We 'd be amazing ! And that scares the shit out of you . Someone 's watching us . Through the trees . 50 yards north . I just saw them move . You got your gun ? Yes . You go to your left . I 'll go right . Three ... two ... one . BIRD FLIES OFF Bollocks ! How did we lose them ? Owen . Well , it 's not Ellie Johnson , that 's for sure . This is a male , late 40s , 50s . Wasn 't killed here . No blood spatter or signs of a struggle . Must have been brought here after he died . Why do that ? It 's not like they 've tried to bury him here . Maybe you disturbed them and they ran away . Maybe it 's a warning . Whoever 's responsible marking out their territory . Cause of death ? Impossible to say . The body 's been stripped of the flesh and bodily organs . Could the Weevils have come out this far ? No , Weevils don 't finish off their victims like this . CAR ENGINE STARTS Is that ours ? Yeah . All right ! I 've said I 'm sorry ! Basic security protocols , Owen ! Oh , get off your high horse , Tosh ! I was carrying that stupid gear . What , the whole time ? and then I was trying to put that bloody tent up . And then ... Yes , I sort of forgot that I 'd left them in there . But I 'm sorry . I 'm human . I ballsed up . Looks like that body wasn 't a warning . More of a decoy . That would mean we 've been watched since we 've arrived . Tosh , can you get a tracking signal ? Already done . I took the liberty . It 's currently 3.4 miles west from here . Gunning at ninety , no doubt . You steal a piece of equipment like that , you drive straight on till morning . Actually , no . It 's been stationary for the past four minutes . I 'd go so far as to say it was parked . There 's a small village in that area . Other than that , nothing for 30 miles . Call me suspicious , but this has all the hallmarks of a trap . Yeah , I was just thinking the same thing . Anyone fancy a walk ? Why would anyone want to live out here ? Has the SUV moved ? Not for an hour now . HEAVY BREATHING Tosh , Ianto - follow the signal , find the SUV . Owen , Gwen ... Let 's see if there 's any room at the inn . Pint of best please , love . And em , yeah , get one for yourself . Where is everybody ? SHE RETCHES You OK ? In there . That burger coming back to haunt you ? Oh , my God ... Gwen ! Jack please ... something 's going on here . Let 's take a look in here ? Come on . One , two , three ... What is it ? There 's another body in there . Same as the other ? What did this , Jack ? Cos whatever it is , it can 't be human . How far is this going to spread ? Stay focused . I should be having dinner with Rhys . What am I doing here with you ? ! Don 't you ever get scared , Jack ? Huh ? There 's another two houses . We 'd better take a look . Whatever they were , I hope you put up a good fight . It 's just half a mile up here . Least we 've still got this . Rest of my stuff was in the vehicle . DISTANT YELP What was that ? Just a ... fox or something . Check round the back . Yeah . ANIMAL YELP We should carry on straight up there . Tosh ! Tosh ! Tosh ! Locked ? Locked . Gwen ! Gwen ! Gwen ! Gwen . Put the gun on the floor ! PUT THE GUN DOWN ON THE FLOOR ! I thought you were them ! I thought they 'd come back for me ! Thought who had come back for you ? WHO ? ! Gwen ... Gwen ! Gwen , what 's happened ? A kid hit her with a shotgun . I got you , I got you . Move , move ! Get in . OK , I 'll check upstairs . Owen ! Owen ! Bet you thought you 'd never be glad to see me ! Right ... Help me ! Listen , listen , I 'm going to have a look at your wound now , OK ? Just keep calm . Hands off , hands off . OK . No , don 't please ! Right , it could 've been much worse . Hold this apply pressure . Oh , Jesus ! The bullets are lodged near the surface . You 've been bloody lucky , girl . Another inch to the left and any one of your vital organs might 've been ... Anyway . D 'you want a quip about feeling a small prick ? No , but thanks for offering . Here we go . All done . GOD ! Let 's get these pellets out , eh ? Right , there 's gonna be a certain amount of residue . So just lie back and think of Torchwood . D 'you miss being a doctor ? Excuse me , I still am a doctor . I just don 't deal with patients any more , that 's all . It 's ideal . That was the bit I always hated . You beauty . Come on . I 'm good . Not bad . What 's taking Tosh and Ianto so long ? Jack , the SUV might be locked up . Or they could be dead ! Well , everyone else is . Sit down ! Tell us what happened here . It 's not human . Look , my mum won 't know what 's happened . They 're expecting me back for the weekend . Look , we 'll get you home OK . What are you going to do ? You can 't fight them . They 're too strong . The only thing we can do is barricade the door . No ! We 'll make base at the pub . Should we go after Tosh and Ianto ? Not till we know what we 're dealing with . But what if it 's too late ? They 're not children . They know what to do . Let 's go . It 's all right . I 've got her . Owen , I want to do it on my own . Look , I 'm sorry about your friends . You know , I never liked camping . Don 't bother . They took the guns . Charming place they 've got . Judging by the sound reverberations ... and the air quality , pretty deep underground . Chances of rescue ? We won 't need rescuing . I haven 't met a cell yet I couldn 't get out of . What were they ? I don 't know . It happened too quickly . Are you worried ? A little . Only ... that body we saw , in the forest . Don 't think about it . See if you can get that light to work , huh ? You 're used to this , aren 't you ? That facial expression you all share . When things get a bit ... out of control . Like you enjoy it . Like you get a high from the danger . You want me to apologise for that ? Don 't you ever wonder how long you can survive before you go mad , or get killed , or lose a loved one ? It 's worth the risk . To protect people . And who protects us ? ! God , I 'm hungry . You should have had that cheeseburger . Not THAT hungry . What 's that ? You 've found something ? It 's just a shoe . Wait , there 's another . There 's dozens of them . Oh , my God ... How many people have been down here ? And what happened to them ? Is that a fridge ? Tosh , what is it , what 's in there ? Tell me ! Ianto , don 't . I want to know ! That 's why there was nothing left on the body . They need to eat . We 're food . So , if we barricade ourselves in , what happens to Tosh and Ianto ? Why are we still talking about this ? Tosh and Ianto can look after themselves . The kid is our first responsibility and they 've already been for him once . They 're not going to give up . So have we ever heard of a species who strip human bodies of flesh and organs ? You need to rest . I 'm compiling what we 've got . Seeing if it helps . We have to assume the others who disappeared have been killed . 17 deaths ? At least . These aren 't casual killers . OK . So all this means is the rift is spreading . Dumping aliens and psychos wherever it fancies . Looks like that . Great . This conversation 's cheered me up no end . Did you see that ? Something outside ? Was that the same one or different ? He said they 'd come back . Let 's not jump to conclusions . We don 't know who they are or what their intentions are . I 'm thinking that 's not a good sign . They 've come back . Kieran , listen to my voice , OK . Just come back . Kieran ! OK , so we didn 't check the cellar . You can 't let them in ! Come back from the door . Don 't let them in ! Sit down ! We 've got this under control ! You don 't understand , you don 't know what they 're like . No , please ... please , no , not me ... ! Kieran ! HELP ME ! It 's pitch black . You don 't have any tracking devices ! Wanna get yourself killed ? Get out of my way ! Look whatever 's in that cellar took three bullets . I heard it fall . Once we know what it is , we 'll know how to deal with it . You do that . We 'll go after Kieran and the others . You are wounded ! Do you think that 's gonna stop me ? ! Be careful . Go . Got to be three steel bolts - top , middle and bottom . How are you at calculating target stress points ? Find the weakest point , bit of brute force ... Nice thought . But it 's reinforced . Get off ! Look at me , you idiot ! I 'm not gonna hurt you ! You 've got a gun . I promise , I promise . OK , OK ... give her some space . Thank you . Were you injured ? When they took you ? Can I see ? I 'm a nurse . OK , OK , OK . Does anyone else know you 're here ? Have you managed to call for help ? We don 't need any help . There 's three more of us in the village . I can 't help you . I 'm sorry . What d 'you mean ? I 've been sent to collect you . I 've got to take you to them . Tell us what 's going on . We can help . No-one 's safe . Every ten years ... .. it takes us again . What takes you ? What is it ? The Harvest . No , please , you have to come with me . Help me . Please ... help . Did you attack us ? I 'm dying , help me ... I 'll tell you everything ... This 'll help you for a short amount of time . Now start talking . You 've got to get help . I know where you can get some . We had a deal . I help you , you tell me where they 've taken the boy and what the hell is going on around here . HE LAUGHS MIRTHLESSLY You don 't know ? What are you doing ? ! Put it back ! You need to know something . A long time ago , I was pretty good at torture . Y 'see , I had quite a reputation as the go-to guy . My job demanded it at the time , you see . So I know where to apply the tiniest amount of pressure to a wound like yours . You 've gotta stop , you 're gonna kill me . PLEASE STOP ! It 's in your power to get me to stop . Just tell me what I need to know . Because in ten seconds , I 'm gonna find a sharp object . Right .. All right . I 'll tell you everything , just stop . Now talk . Are you sure you 're all right ? Yeah , fine , I 'm fine . That 's all we bloody need . Let me do the talking , I 'll get rid of him . Who are you , please ? Special Ops . From Torchwood , have you heard of Torchwood ? What 's that then , a band is it ? What 's wrong with her ? Mate , you wouldn 't understand . What 's that light over there ? The Big House ? Sort of unofficial village hall . Village meeting tonight , that 's why I 'm here . Constabulary report . Come on . Where do you think you 're going ? In there , please . If you help us , we can stop all this . Please . I 'm sorry . Get back . Oh , God , that stench ... Tell us what these creatures are . Do they look like us ? How else are we gonna look ? There are three more out there . Not a problem . How are they ? They 're in a good state . I think they 're the best we 've ever had . Yeah ? Oh , I forgot to tell you , we caught the boy . Finally . Come on . I won 't tell anyone ! Who is he ? He 's meat . I 'm afraid we 're all just meat . Get ready to run . What 're you going to do , put us on meat hooks ? No , not yet . You see ... meat ... has to be tenderised first . Go ! Get the others ! I know you 're here . No-one 's coming for you . SHE SCREAMS No more games . Hush now . SHE CHOKES Get off her or I 'll shoot ! GET OFF HER OR I 'LL SHOOT ! We saw the torchlight . They 've murdered all the villagers . They 're cannibalising the bodies ! Put the gun down . You 're in no position to negotiate , mate . S 'all right , it 's all right . You 're safe . You can arrest him now . I said you can arrest him ! You gonna arrest me , Huw ? That 'd be a laugh , wouldn 't it ? My own uncle . Put the gun down , don 't you hurt him . Shoot the bastard . Split his skull . Put the fucking gun down ! Shoot . I will shoot you ! Put it down . Pull the trigger , kill . Why don 't you give me the gun ? Mate . Who are these people ? This is our village . But the villagers are dead . They 're all involved . They 've all been doing it . This is our Harvest . Only in the bloody countryside ! You sick fuckers . Are you OK ? Where 's Ianto ? What have you done with him ? Wake up , man . Time to be bled . Like veal , it takes a long time . But it definitely makes the meat taste better . What the fuck ... ? Oh , really ? No , Jack ! Don 't do it . These people don 't deserve warnings . Let me question him . I have to understand . I want to know why . Otherwise this , this is too much . They 're injured , they need to get to the hospital . Owen you control the bleeding and then phone the police . Jack , please give me an hour with him . Don 't tell me you don 't want to know too . The whole village was involved . Every generation . Our tradition . Once a decade . Target those travelling through , those most likely to disappear . And butcher them . What sort of people are you that you wake up in the morning and think , this is what I 'm going to do ? Why 'd you do it ? Come on ! Make me understand . Why do you care ? I have seen things you would never believe . And this is the only thing I can 't understand . So , keep on wondering . Tell me ! I need to know why ! That 's enough . Time to go . I 'll tell you something ... if you let me whisper . OK . ( Cos it made me happy . ) Come on , out .. 'I had a good job before this , 'I thought in a year or two , perhaps a baby , 'I know Rhys would be a good dad and I could try for Desk Sergeant and ... 'Well , it was all slotting into place ... ' 'And then I met you lot . 'All these things ... ' .. all these things , they 're changing me . 'Changing how I see the world . ' And I can 't share them with anyone . You can now . What is this thing ? With this you can read peoples minds , it levels the pitch between man and God . We 'll find you . My guess is you 're not from around these parts . Shagging a woman on the rebound . Wouldn 't be the first time I 'd been a rebound shag . You need to see this , this is completely impossible . Tell me what to do . Get me into Torchwood .

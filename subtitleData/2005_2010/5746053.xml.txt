 © © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ Mobile - + 919815899536 Look at yourselves . Unplug from your chairs , get up and look in a mirror . What you see is how God made you . We 're not meant to experience the world through a machine . What you 're telling me is that the monkey is operating this arm - with nothing but his thoughts . - Absolutely . There are 100 sensors , each listening to a different brain cell or neuron . Physically disabled people will be able to operate fully synthetic bodies . It provides a tremendous amount of hope for the future . Because of the technology that we have , at a time of war , we 're going to start seeing this more and more . As manufacturing capacity expanded from military and industrial use , surrogates became affordable to the general public , causing a revolution in how we live . The ability to leave your home without risk of disease or injury , to have perfect looks without trips to the gym or plastic surgery . There 's no question that at some point they 'll be persons like anyone else . They will not be human , but that they will be part of our community ? There 's no question in my mind . The decision came down five-to-four that the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the use of surrogates in daily life . Right now we are witnessing an event that is of an evolutionary significance . According to VSI , the industry 's leading manufacturer , over 98 percent of the world population uses a surrogate in all facets of their daily life . We 're in the midst of profound changes . Things that were once unimaginable have become inevitable . Since the global embrace of surrogacy , crime rates have dropped to record lows . We 've witnessed an incredible reduction in violent crime , communicable disease , and discrimination . Problems that have plagued societies for centuries solved almost overnight . We are the creators . We will be making them ... Do everything for us , all in one machine . But there is a minority who actively oppose surrogates and are moving to limit their use . Many people will see this as the invasion of the inhuman . They 've established reservations or surrogacy-free zones in major cities around the country . Led by Zaire Powell , or as he is better known to his followers , The Prophet . Those machines walking around out there ? They 're a lie . You have been sold a lie . You 're going to love Tosca . All right , but don 't tell me how it ends . The way they all end . Everyone dies . I 'm so glad you could come back east for a visit . Well , anything for a break from exams . We 're almost there . Listen , thanks for lending him to me . Have a wonderful time . I love you . I love you , too , Dad . You know , Armando , I 'm not really in the mood for opera . Fort Point ? You read my mind . Get lost , meatbag . I 'm Agent Peters . This is Agent Greer . FBI . Yeah , some jackass on a motorcycle wiped out a bunch of units . What do you need us for ? Well , I was just going to file it as just a vandalism report , but it turns out this unit 's unregistered . Hmm . Looks like he 's going to need new optics . No shit . The identity chip is completely fried . What do you got on the girl ? Registered to a Cameron McCallister - out in Worcester . - She file a report ? No , that 's just it . No calls , no nothing . Come on . Let 's go talk to her operator . Cam ? Maybe nobody 's home . My surrie 's in for an upgrade . They gave me this crappy loaner . - Could you ? - Certainly . Cam ? Cam is a good tenant , you know . Pays the rent on time , never leaves the apartment . Cam ? Cam ? Oh , my God ! Don 't touch anything , please . I 'll call it in . You 're sure this is Cameron McCallister ? Yes . This is Agent Peters . We tracked down the blonde 's operator . Yeah . Better send a coroner . Have you ever seen anything like this ? - Good morning . - Hey . - Where 's your ? - In the charger . You pull another all-nighter ? Yes , I did . What do you think about taking a break ? - A break ? - Mm-hmm . I 've got vacation time saved up . How about Hawaii ? Bridget said she got an amazing deal . Hawaii would be great . She had this buff surrie in Maui . She took it surfing , parasailing , deep-sea diving . Know that rental place on Boylston ? I was thinking about us . You and me , going away someplace together . And leave our units at home ? Are you kidding ? We could take a drive out to the Cape . We haven 't done that ... Can we talk about this another time ? You know , I should get to work . The shop has been really busy . Everyone wants new looks for summer . Yeah , I was just thinking that , um ... It just feels like we ... haven 't really spent much time together lately . We 're together every day . As surrogates . Not the same . It 's better . Yo , Canter . He 's been in there all weekend . He 's going to miss the psych final . - Jesus . - Somebody call the cops ! We are confronted with an unprecedented situation . Two people have died while connected to their stim chairs . According to the pathologist , their brains were liquefied in their skulls . Whatever happened to their surrogates killed them . Sir ... how is it even possible ? We don 't know . I 'm imposing a total media blackout . No one from this office is going to be responsible for setting off a nationwide panic . The public cannot be allowed to get the idea that using a surrogate can be fatal . Tuxedo boy 's last moments . Get lost , meatbag . - Looks like we got ourself a witness . - Mm-hmm . Wait a minute . - What is that ? - Exactly . - It 's some kind of weapon . - Anything yet ? Hang onto yourself . I think we may actually have a homicide here . Come here . Look at this . Are you serious ? No , we don 't know that for sure . Yeah , but what if it is a homicide ? When was the last one ? This could be huge . Yeah , Lee , go . Got your next of kin . I hope you 're sitting down . The kid 's father is Lionel Canter . As in the inventor of surrogates , Lionel Canter . Jared Canter , son of Dr. Lionel Canter , was found dead in his southern California dormitory this morning . Cause of death remains unknown . A college sophomore , Jared was the only son of the man known around the world as the father of surrogacy . The former chairman of VSI shaped it into one of the largest corporations in the world . However , a split between Canter and his VSI partners over the direction of the company , led to Canter 's firing seven years ago . Publicly humiliated and forced out of the company he helped to build , Canter has since remained absent from the public eye . Dr. Canter is expecting you . - He actually lives here ? - I didn 't say that . You 'll be speaking with one of his surrogates . I work for Dr. Canter . His private elevator is this way . Please , wait in here . Nice place . It should be . He gets a piece of every surrogate they sell . - Dr. Canter . - That 's right . You 're with the FBI . - Yes , we are . - This way . I can 't help but notice the similarities between your surrogate and the one your son , Jared , was using . I never really knew Jared as a child . He grew up with his mother in California , who kept him from me . When he went to college , I encouraged him to borrow my surrogates whenever he wanted . How did you manage to do that ? A surrie has to be coded to your neural signature . I 'm not exactly your average VSI consumer . This was just a way for me to spend time with my son . It 's a felony to inhabit a surrogate registered to another operator . No offense . We 're just trying to straighten out our facts . What is this ? Some kind of good-cop-bad-cop routine ? - No , sir . - You 're trying to handle me ? - No , sir . - Because I 'm not going to be handled . - Dr. Canter , I know how you must feel . - Do you ? Yes , sir . I lost a son myself . Do you have any idea why someone might want to harm Jared ? No . Or yourself ? Oh , my God . If it was me they were after ... I 'm responsible for my son 's death . Well , I guess the interview 's over . No ... Robotic surrogates combine the durability of machines with the grace and beauty of the human form to make your life safer and better . Whether your budget allows for simplified generic or our ... Get ready to live your life without any risk or danger . You can live your life without limitations , and become anyone you want to be from the comfort and safety of your own home . VSI , where it all began . Do what you want . Be what you want . Agents Greer and Peters ? I 'm Victor Welch , VP Corporate Relations . Please , sit . - Thanks for taking the time to see us . - No problem . You ... you must know Andy Stone . Our immediate superior . Do give him my regards . We 're from the legal department . Hope you don 't mind if we sit in . Not at all . Two of you might be interested in a free software upgrade we 're offering all law enforcement officials . Better night vision for your synth units , improved pursuit capability . Any idea of how a surrogate 's head would explode from the inside ? Mr. Welch isn 't qualified to answer that question . What do the operators say ? Not much . They 're dead . If you 're trying to imply a link between VSI products and an operator 's accidental death ... I 'm not implying anything . I want to know how an operator can be killed by signals from a surrogate . The idea itself is absurd . If it were possible , it would defeat the entire purpose of surrogacy . Surries have jumped from bridges , been shot , even blown to bits without the least bit of harm to their operators . The fail-safes always kick in . I assure you , VSI 's products have the most stringent safety standards - in the industry . - What about a human head ? What would cause one of them to blow up ? Agent Greer , we 're not doctors . Honey , I don 't know what you are . For all I know you could be some big , fat dude sitting in a stim chair with his dick hanging out . Interesting technique . I hate lawyers . What are you doing ? Mr. Steinberg ? Seth Steinberg ? Hello . Sorry . I was in the can . This is Agent Peters . I 'm Agent Greer , with the FBI . Really ? An identity chip this damaged ? Every circuit must have fired off at once . Kablooie . Have you ever seen anything like this before ? Last week a truckload of GI Joes did come back for reconditioning , and a couple of the surries were missing optics . Mind if we take a look at them ? Here we go . No bullet holes ? No blast damage ? No scratches , no dirt , no mud . - Mind if I check out the identity chip ? - Can 't . - Why not ? - It didn 't come back with one . I 'm down ! I 'm down . Damn things aren 't free , Pulaski . Take the snipers from behind this time . Yes , sir . Back online . Follow me . Keep an eye on Bravo Company . We 'll kick some ass , sir . Agent Greer , you 're wasting your time with these questions . Why would the Defense Department develop a weapon that could wipe out our own troops ? So no such weapon exists ? If it did , I 'd know about it . And the soldier that we saw ? We routinely remove motherboards and optics for analysis . If you 'll excuse me , we 're in the middle of a peacekeeping operation . - Check your screen . - What ? - Miles Strickland . - Who ? Miles Strickland . Meatbag . I did a run on criminal records for Moto Guzzi drivers in black Arai helmets , and guess what I found ? He 's already in the system . He was arrested a month ago for multiple counts of armed robbery . What 's really weird about this , after he was busted , they let him off . Someone on the inside is protecting him , but I put out an APB anyway . Recognition search caught your dready . - Where ? - Dorchester . Corner of Park and Adams . Not far from the reservation . Boston PD is on its way . Stay here and keep tabs on him . - Wait a minute . Where are you going ? - Dorchester . It wasn 't too difficult . I put his face in the system , and bingo , we found him in an alley . K-33 over there brought it to my attention . Thanks , Jerry ! He 's one of our best watchers . He 's semi-retired . So he gets to work out of his beach house in Maine . Pretty sweet , huh ? Yeah , it 's a nice setup you have here . Yeah , we can access every surrie on the grid here . Touch of a button ... I can tap into anyone 's feed . It 's kind of like being inside God 's head . Oh , boy . I felt that one coming . Bobby Saunders , by the way . Jennifer Peters . Yeah . Yeah , you are , aren 't you ? - Can I ask you a question ? - Hmm ? Why no surrogate ? Me ? Oh , they 've been trying to puppet me for years . But they ain 't built a machine that can handle this puppy yet . Excuse me a second . We have an assault and battery in progress . I need warrants to shut them down immediately . Charlie four six three niner . Sierra seven eight five five . Let 's see if they have a security camera in the hotel . - Excellent . There is one . - Get her , man ! - Warrant received . - Shut up ! Agent Peters , watch this . Boom . Boom . Since when have you been able to cut off operators ? Brand-new software . I call it " buffering . " Lets me disconnect anyone from their surrogate . That can 't be legal . It 's a gray area . They don 't ask , we don 't tell . It 's pretty cool , huh ? Aw , come on . Relax . We 're the good guys . Latest hit on the bike , turning east on South Hampton half a mile from the res . Be careful . You 're heading straight toward dread territory . We don 't have jurisdiction to fly over there . It 's restricted airspace . Greer , are you there ? © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ © P @ rM !

I ain 't done nothing ! I ain 't done nothing ! Give me the bag . Throw it over here . Throw it over here now . - You 're an abomination . - Oh , God . Maggie ! Maggie ! Lionel Canter 's on the phone . He 's called for Greer a half-dozen times . I can 't deal with this right now . - He 's upset . - Tell him someone will call him back . Peters ? You gotta believe me . I tried to stop him . You didn 't try hard enough . You 're done for the day . Clock out . Oh , you 're kidding . Turquoise ? I wouldn 't carry a purse that color , much less a whole new suit . Oh , my God . Tom ? Oh , my God . Bridge , call an ambulance ! Miles Strickland , is it ? Why are you ? What 's going on ? Who was it ? Who gave you the weapon and paid you to use it ? I don 't know . Miles , you can 't lie to me . I 'm not lying . I swear to God , sir , I 'm not lying . He never told me his name . We talked on disposable cell phones . I never saw his face . I couldn 't tell you who he was if my life depended on it . A police chase through Dorchester concluded with an FBI helicopter crash-landing inside Boston 's Dread Reservation . Residents of the reservation are outraged over what they 're calling a gross violation of their territorial sovereignty . Human Coalition leader , The Prophet , responded to the incident in a statement made earlier today . They 've attacked us , declared war on our way of life and left us with one option : Revolution ! We did not throw the first stone , but we will throw the last . Hi . Hey . - How 's the headache ? - Still there . - Thanks for being here . - Of course . Imagine a world where children are always safe . A world where every child and every parent is secure . Make every childhood a happy one . Surrogates for kids , exclusively from VSI , where it all be ... Knock , knock . - Hey . - Andy , hi . Oh , my gosh , we haven 't seen you forever . - I know . - I should let you guys talk . Will you be OK ? Mm-hmm . I 'll be fine . I 'll see you tomorrow morning . - Bye . - Bye . How bad ? The doctor said you 're lucky to be alive . Good thing you unplugged . You got to go get him . Strickland 's got that weapon . You just get a court order , and you ... There won 't be any court orders . - You 've been suspended . - For what ? You 've violated our treaty with the dreads ... Forget the treaty ! He killed five cops ! I 'm going to take care of this case myself , personally . All right ? Now , I 'm afraid the bureau won 't be able to supply you with a new surrogate until after the official inquiry . The same goes for your gun and your badge . Don 't think about this now . He killed five cops , Andy . Take some time to heal . - Hey . - Hey . - Sorry I 'm late . - That 's OK . Wow . You look a lot like your synth . - Yeah . - Should we go ? How long has it been since you 've been out without a surrie ? I can 't even remember . I can 't believe they didn 't give you something for the anxiety . Greer . Look , this isn 't going to work . - I 'm fine . - I have an idea . Come on . This is a really bad idea . It 's going to be all right . I 'm sure we 'll find you something decent . We 're going to have you back on your feet in a sec . Sync looks good . It 's responding well to signal , right ? Feels numb . It 's only a base model . It comes with vision and hearing . You want other senses , they 're extra . If you like seeing your own face when you look in the mirror , no problem . We 'll scan your head , cast the thermoplastic and you 're good to go in less than an hour . And no charge on the improvements . I 'm sure you wouldn 't mind taking yourself back five , ten years . What do you think of that ? I think we 're done here . Greer . Tom . Tom . Come on . You can 't come out here by yourself . It 's not safe . - I 'm fine . - Let me take you home . I 'm not going home ! Tom , you gotta forget the case . Because Stone is going to run things his way . And as far as we 're concerned , it 's over . It 's not over until we get that weapon back . Then you got to let me help you . They 're not going to let you in . Take care of yourself , Peters . Death came for Miles Strickland ... as death comes to all men . But for Miles , it 's not an ending ... it 's a new beginning . When you sacrifice your own personal desires for a greater cause , a greater good , you never die . You never disappear . That is what it means to be human . There is no alternative . You can try to escape by living through a puppet . Through a machine . But , deep down inside , you know you 're living a lie . Here , inside these walls , we understand the truth . Sorry . We sacrifice many modern pleasures and conveniences to feel truly connected . Not with machines ... but with ourselves . This is the human condition . This is what gives life meaning . My friends , soon the day will come when surrogacy must end . That day , I promise you , is close at hand . The day we get a second chance . Excuse me . Excuse me , fellows . Whoa . Can I help you ? Yeah , I 'd like to speak to The Prophet for a minute . You and everybody else , but no . What are you , some kind of cop or something ? You got no jurisdiction here . Can I talk to you about Miles Strickland , please ? Enough . It 's different when you actually feel the pain , isn 't it ? What happened to Strickland ? Was he a friend of yours ? He had a weapon . A very dangerous weapon . My people will do anything to get this back . Well , if I happen to come across such a weapon , I promise to have it delivered to your door . Show him to the gates . Gently . Agent Greer . May I offer you a ride ? You 'll have to excuse my appearance . It 's not safe for me to use my usual surrogates . Dr. Canter ? This is one of VSI 's newer models . How long have you been following me ? Long enough to know you 're getting nowhere solving my son 's murder . You lost a child , Agent Greer . How ? A car accident . It was just an accident . I 'm sorry . I can think of no worse tragedy than a parent outliving a child . All I can tell you ... is that the man who killed your son is dead . His name was Miles Strickland . Lived on the res . He was killed by his own people . And that 's it ? Case solved ? One man didn 't act on his own . Whatever killed my son was an extraordinarily sophisticated technology . Far beyond the capability of the dreads . We 're talking about a billion-dollar weapons project . Who do you know spends money like that ? Focus on the weapon , where it came from . Mmm . Do me . That was intense . Hey , Maggie . - No , thank you . - Come on . It will take the edge off . Ooh ... Uh-oh ... Tom ? Honey ? I thought you were still in the hospital . Yeah . I can see that . What happened to you ? Tom , I don 't want you going out without your surrie ever again . Tom . You look very nice . Sexy . OK , don 't start . I 'm sorry . Those guys , they 're friends of Bridget 's . She brought them over . She wanted to go to this party . I didn 't even want to go . - How long have you been jacking ? - I don 't . I don 't do it . What does it matter if I did ? Why are you being like this ? OK , go have a good time , Maggie . Tom ! Tom , stop it ! Tom . Tom , what was that ? - What ? - What do you want from me ? I want you . I want my wife . I am your wife , and you won 't see it . You 're not her . No , you 're not . Not ... Not ... this ... Not this ... thing , this ... this ... I just want you . And I want the woman that 's in that room . My wife . Things have changed , Tom . No , you 've changed . You 're just scared . You 're just scared . We could go talk to somebody . Maggie . Maggie , don 't walk away from me . Agent Greer , is that ... is that you ? Yeah . You ... you look terrible . Thanks . You , too . The identity chip 's completely fried . What do you got on the girl ? Come on . Let 's go talk to her op ... We can access every surrie on the grid . Touch of a button , I can tap into anyone 's feed . Transfer to remote operator . Wish I could help . This thing killed five cops , one of my men . It almost put me in the ground . I know it 's a weapon . I want to know what kind . You 're asking me to compromise highly classified information . I know where it is . - Where is it ? - Right . It 's called an OD . Overload device . The idea was to end the battle with one shot . You beam a software virus straight to the CPU . Disables the surries instantly . We didn 't know the virus would defeat the built-in fail-safes . Kill the operators . Who makes it ? VSI . After the test , the project was scrapped . Every unit was destroyed . Except for this one , right ? Where is it ? Right now it 's in the hands of the Human Coalition . How long have they had it ? A day . Maybe two . This is out of your hands . Military will handle this . You called for us ? Take this to the federal building downtown . A woman will meet you there . Agent Jennifer Peters . You 're to give it to her and her alone . Peters . What are you doing ? Just a background check on VSI . Structural stuff . Those are internal financial records . Talk to Jenkins in corporate . Sixth floor . Don 't forget the cheekbones . OK , honey , face off . Mags ... Hiya , Tom . Those ... smile muscles need to set . - Hey . - Hi . Sorry about last night . I 'm at work , Tom . - I didn 't come here to argue . - Good . See , I feel like I 'm going crazy . It 's ... I just ... I love you . I love the smart , beautiful , intelligent , funny ... woman , and ... I can 't sleep . And when I do I have these dreams that are ... And I can 't stop thinking about him . Tom . Don 't . Don 't you ever think about him ? Of course I think about him , Tom . You say you don 't sleep ? You say you have nightmares ? Well , that girl who you say is funny and charming and witty and has a great smile ? She doesn 't smile anymore . I don 't believe that . The only reason I can get up in the morning and get out of the house is because this is who I am now . - But that 's OK , Maggie ... - No . No . - Maggie ... - No . Maggie , wait . © P @ rM !

NdeR M @ nkÖÖ Brothers and sisters , gather close and prepare yourselves . The day of the resurrection is upon us . Today we make history . Today we launch the revolution ! Gotta go now ! You all know what we 're looking for . Remember , do not fire unless absolutely necessary . The biologicals , too . Over here , over here . - Over there ! - Take cover ! Ah ! - Cease fire ! - Hands behind your head . My God . I couldn 't figure out why the cops let Strickland off . So I started going through the payroll records . You won 't believe this . For the past 16 months ... - Working for us . - That 's right . Which means Stone 's got to be dirty . Looks like he hired Strickland to kill Canter . Hey , Tom . Thought you were on leave . Well , yeah , I am . Actually , I 'm just suspended pending ... further investigation . But I 'm just clearing my desk out . You should be home , recuperating . OK ? Not walking around here in the flesh . I was home . Then I came here to clean out my desk . And before the medication kicks in , hopefully , I can find a box and ... Oh ! Victor Welch wanted me to say hello . - I 'm sorry ? - Victor Welch , VSI . Good-looking kid ? Very excited you 're coming over there . Finally moving into the private sector . You must be excited , huh ? Why don 't you come in my office . You 're not looking too sharp . Yeah , I got a minute , you know . It 's a good move for you . It 's a really good group over there . Smart , talented , great legal department . It 's a great working environment . And you got to be happy with those first-year stock options , huh ? What are you talking about ? Miles Strickland . The guy I was chasing . The guy you hired to kill Canter . Tom , you got it all wrong . You gave him the weapon . VSI makes them . They give one to you , you give it to Strickland so he can go out and kill Canter . The only problem is , he killed his son by mistake . Something is wrong with you . Why are you doing this ? Money ? Is that what it is ? You need help . This is Stone . That son of a bitch Greer disabled my unit ! Stop him ! Go ! Go ! Jesus . No wonder VSI wants Canter dead . He 's in bed with The Prophet . He 's funding the anti-surrogacy movement . He 's given them millions . Crazy bastard invents surrogates then does everything he can to destroy them . It doesn 't connect Stone to the murder . We need to link him to the weapon . He needed codes to use it . I want you to look for access codes . We get the codes , we nail Stone . Good job , Agent Greer . Thank you . This is Agent Peters . I found Greer . He 's been in an accident at Market and Hanover . - FBI ! - Get out of the car . He 's gone . Scan for an identity chip . He doesn 't have one . He 's a meatbag . There 's an exit in back ! Hey ! Where you going ? Hey ! Bobby , it 's Greer . I need a remote shutdown . Agent Peters has been hijacked . You 've got to disconnect her . Bobby ? Hello , Bobby ? Peters ... have you gone insane ? Why don 't you put the gun down ? What are you trying to prove ? She 's tapping into the entire surrie network ! Maggie , get off line right away , as soon as you get this message . Something 's gonna happen to the surrogates . She 'll only speak to you , sir . Why don 't you move in and take her down ? She has a human hostage . That slob Saunders ! Peters ? - Peters , it 's me , Andy Stone . - That 's far enough , Stone . I know who hired you to kill me . I hope my old partners at VSI paid you well . Did you feel even a second of remorse when you found out you 'd murdered an innocent boy ? Canter . I don 't believe it . OK ... How about you tell me something , doctor . Huh ? What did you expect VSI to do ? Just stand by while you tore down everything they built ? You left us no choice but to take you out . You create this technology , change the world , and now you want to destroy it ? So what ? So you can take us backwards ? So we can all live like dreads ? So we can live like human beings . Really , doctor . You should learn to live with your regrets . Now , give me the gun . No ! That 's for my son . I need to see your boss . I need to see Dr. Canter right away . Oh , good . Listen to me . I got to see your boss , Dr. Canter . Hey ! Don 't ! Oh , Jesus ! Device connected . Over here , officers . This way . Warning . Commencing upload . Hello , Tom . Nice to finally meet you ... in the flesh . Now , lie on the floor face down . It 's a little different when you have to kill somebody with your own hands . When you have to squeeze the trigger . When you don 't have a machine to do your dirty work . Feel that ? The accelerated pulse ? The heightened awareness ? Savoring each breath as if it were your last ? That 's what you 've been missing . It 's what everybody 's been missing . So you kill millions of people . I changed the course of human history when I invented surrogates . Now I 'm going to change it back . You can 't change what 's been done . You and I know that better than most people . My son 's death will not have been in vain . Not if it heals mankind . Heals mankind ? That 's what you want to do ? You want to kill everyone ? That 's going to heal mankind ? They 're already dead . They died the minute they plugged into those machines . This is not the solution ! That 's the way it is . That 's not the way it is ! I had a vision . I was going to empower the powerless . To enable others like me to walk , to feel , - to live a normal life . - Listen to me ! They 're going to call you a murderer ! That 's what you 're doing . Surrogacy is a perversion . It 's an addiction . And you have to kill the addict to kill the addiction . Upload complete . You 're too late . What I 've done can 't be stopped . Now you 're going to be a witness to the rebirth of humanity . That 's my gift to you . No ! No ! Selecting all surrogates . How do we make it stop ? Bobby , it 's Greer . Tom Greer . How do we shut this thing down ? Full database selected . Jesus . It 's trying to kill everyone . Listen , that thing has just uploaded a virus into the system that 's going to kill anyone who 's using a surrogate . It 's already started . Bobby , we need to unplug everyone . Now ! - Oh , shit . - Think ! Uh ... OK . Move over to the terminal to the left . Type in password " red 253 . " We can 't unplug it , but maybe we can buffer the operators . Oh , God . OK , we got ten seconds . OK , look , there are three boxes . Type in " tango " in the first , " X-ray " in the second , " 772 " in the third . Hit " enter " ! Hit enter ! What hap ? Ah , shit ! Shift and enter . Shift and enter . Aah ... We just saved about a billion lives there . OK , now we got to keep the surrogates from getting fried . Please go back to the first terminal , hit the enter key . Hit the enter key , please ! Good . Now press " yes . " So that 's it ? Everyone 's safe ? - What ? - All the people ? Yes . Of course . All the operators are safe . But if you don 't press abort , all the surries are going to be destroyed . We don 't have a lot of time . Hit " yes . " Hi . Hello . Hit " yes " , Greer . Greer , I 'm talking all the surrogates . Greer , what are you doing ? Greer ! For God sakes , what are you waiting for ? Press the freaking button , Tom ! - Freeze ! - Show me your hands ! Transmit complete . Excuse me . Please bear with us as we 're trying to piece together exactly what has occurred today . There has been a total systems failure of the central surrogate grid in every major city on the eastern seaboard , possibly in the entire United States . ... describing an identical failure in those cities . This is unbelievable . No reports of human casualties . The damage appears limited only to surrogate units . Thus far , no statements from VSI . They have not responded to requests for information . Paris , London , Beijing , all reporting the same thing . There is still no official word when or if surrogate services can be restored . It appears , at least for now , that we 're on our own . © © © P @ rM ! NdeR © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ

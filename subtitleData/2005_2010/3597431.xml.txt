 I 'm sorry . I have to go . I 'm not safe for you to be around . But , know this ... nobody resigns from Summakor . Nobody ! They 're selling tickets for your execution , Michael , but they 're calling it a " promotion . " There is a place .. another place . It 's where they sent them . It 's where they sent me . It 's where they sent you . Whatever you do , stay away from Summakor . You killed her ! Come on out here and fight like a man ! Every bit of pain I know , is because of you ! I will find a way to make you suffer ... To make you feel ! Do you hear me ? Hello ? Do you come here to hurt me ? You raised me up on lies . Did you do that to hurt me ? You 're my son ! Lies ! Do you think I don 't doubt ? My conscience whispers to me night and day . And sometimes , I listen ... But most of the time , I keep my faith in the village . Where is the village ? Inside . The mind is capable of anything , because everything is in it , all the past , as well as all the future . She volunteered . Your mother 's mind is capable of anything . The science of it all beguiled her . But the reason for it ... The real reason , was you . She did it for her son . This one opens the cabinet , as you know , 11-12 . That is where the pills are kept , the pills that keep her sleeping ... keep her dreaming . I give it to you . Why now ? I thought , " if I can give him this , " a day with her . " Think of it . You will meet your mother . She won 't know me ... who I am . How will I know what to say to her ? A day with your mother . You want to know the truth .. When you decide . Don 't look at me ! Put it on your head . What are you .. what are you doing ? You scared me . You kissed me . Yeah .. uh , I , uh , I-I don 't know why . I , um .. You do know . No , I mean , I don 't know why I did it , there . I just couldn 't help myself . You couldn 't help yourself . That 's right . I know that feeling . No . No , I 'm sorry .. Not like this ! 313 , I need to talk with you . 4-15 .. she 's gone . Is it just nothingness down in those holes ? What 's happened to her ? She 's gone . I , um , that 's what we know about her . So , uh .. My head is so full of nightmares . What , and last night , what was your head full of then ? Last night ? - How very flattering . What ? Look , as you can see , I 'm sort of rushed off my feet , so , please ... - What 's wrong with you ? You were in my apartment last night . You might at least acknowledge that fact . Is this some kind of dream ? - Just go ! Oh , no , man . You must be jokin ' . What do you mean ? Last thing I need is another fight with you . Another fight ? Access denied . Access denied . Damn .. I 've been sitting on my card , again . I 'll have to go downstairs and get it renewed . You have a problem with that ? What 's it for ? You 're asking me , what is it for ? Yes . Are you gonna give me a hard time , again ? Again ? Look , if you just tell me what this receipt is for , I 'll go . I 'll leave you alone . Anyone can fake a receipt . Why would I fake a receipt ? I don 't even know what it 's for . Are you recording this ? I don 't supply knives . You show a man who says I gave him any kind of weapon , I will show you a liar . Thank you . Operator . Hello .. clinic , please . You said you spoke with me . - Spoke ? Man , I thought you were gonna bite my face off . But I wasn 't there , it wasn 't me . Look , don 't get weird on me , Six . If you got mental difficulties , get mental help because we all got our problems . Something is happening here . 313 said I was with her , but I wasn 't there . It wasn 't me . - Hey , listen . You have got to get your act together . Ah . Ah . Who are you ? You know who I am . You saw what Two did to 4-15 , and you 're just gonna take that ? What 's the plan , huh ? Just stand there and shout at his door ? Do you think words are gonna change anything , hmm ? I am who you were intended to be . I am vengeance . There is only one way . Kill Two . Ugh . Ugh . Come here . Ah . Who is he ? Who is who ? There 's a man in the village who looks like me , exactly like me . He says he 's going to kill you . Six is going to kill me ? No .. he 's going to kill you . Oh , and that Six , he 's angry ? Well , isn 't that how you feel ? Come on , admit it , you 'd love it-love it , the chance to kill me . After what you 've done ... yes . I 'd like you dead . So , you will be the assassin . Isn 't that logical ? Don 't we live by logic ? Not your logic , not anymore . And your game , what you do to me here , won 't stop me . Are you quite sure that it is a game ? Yes .. ' cause no one gets close to Two , unless Two wants them to . Well , perhaps he will . You will . Perhaps the moment will come . I 'll walk today . Be seeing you . * You were my sunshine * * My only sunshine * * You made me happy when skies were gray * * You 'll never know dear how much I loved you * * How could you take my sunshine away * Impersonating Two is an act of treason . In the event of a Two impersonator arising , you must seek him out and apprehend him . This man may look like Two , but you will know that he is not Two , because he is not Two . He may appear in the village in a disheveled state , which has elements of resemblance to Two . He may claim to be Two , but he is not , and he must be treated as who he is , which is someone who is not Two . He is a danger to the village . Mom ? 11-12 . Do you have cigarettes ? No . But would you like a map of the village ? Are you sure you don 't have cigarettes ? Would you look ? We haven 't had cigarettes here for eight years and five months . If you don 't look , how can you be really sure that you 're right ? Guilty pleasures . I didn 't supply you with these cigarettes . No . I don 't have them . I don 't even know what they are . I 've forgotten they even existed . You came in here to buy a map . I used to smoke in order to think . You did ? And are you thinking now ? I am . Sometimes ... Yes ? I think . Yes , go on . If-if I could choose this , a place I want to spend the rest of my life , a warm place , with no memory . Just be careful what you say around here . People will report you as soon as look at you . Don 't be different . I wonder if we smoke to feed the guilt . Speaking only for myself , I smoke for that fine oaky flavor wi-with just a hint of lavender . These things kill you , you know ? The main health risks in tobacco relate to diseases of the cardiovascular system , In particular , myocardial infarction ; diseases of the respiratory tract , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and asthma , emphysema , and cancer , in particular , lung cancer and cancers of the larynx and tongue . So I 've heard . Smoking is a kind of ... suicide . That 's a bit philosophical for a thursday . Thank you . And I say good day to you . Operator . Hello .. clinic , please . Am I like you imagined ? I mean , you know , do-do I-do I act like .. I know what you mean . Sorry . It 's just I haven 't had , uh , too much practice at this and , um- - Will your father be joining us ? All the family together , I-I 'd like that . No , he 's , um , he 's gone away for a while . He suggested that perhaps I get to know you ... Get to understand . The things I 've seen ... in these walls . You mean .. Everything . Every step ... you ever took . I mean , nobody warned me . Nobody ever said that ... dreaming would be such hard work . Say what 's in those sad eyes of yours . I 'm sure you 'll see that the village has ... everything that you 'll need . It doesn 't have you . Oh . Two . Oh ! It would be quite a coincidence , if I was Two , but I am Un-Two , so , there is no coincidence . You know , if he gets to you , I won 't be able to stop him . I am no more than a numberless wanderer . I know nothing about killers and their motives , lost to their own appetites . Such beasts have no moral compass . Then why did you create ' em ? If that 's what you don 't want me to become , Then why ? It might be fun , though , might it not , to indulge him ? Take him a woman . Say 313 , if that 's what you desire . If I can 't control my desires , you can control me ? Animals like that are easily manipulated . They leave themselves open to be prodded in whatever direction their masters may ask . Yes . Oh , I pity a man like that . Or I would , if I knew anything about such things . Hmm ? Hey . hey ! Hey , man , don 't you know you can 't be sittin ' there just dreamin in the sun ? Gonna get into all kinds of trouble out here . Come on , we gotta get you up . Where do you live ? What 's your number ? Oh , I 'm a man with no number . Oh , no-no - no-no-no-no . Don 't say that out loud . You 'll have every undercover around here down on your case . Come on , get you off the street . You know what he 's doin ' , don 't ya ? What are you accusing me of now ? Look , he 's taken some part of me , separated it out somehow . It 's out there . Please listen ! Look , no . Look , I 'm sorry to bop your balloon , Six , but you were there in my bedroom , and as far-fetched as it may sound , I actually gave you the elbow . You kicked him out ? Grow up ! You have a problem with that ? Yeah . My card got bent , and I need a replacement , please . You have the paperwork to back that up ? Why would I lie ? Why would you come into work at dawn ? Why are you here ? I 'm always here . Do I know you ? I 'm the access guy . Everybody knows the access guy . If you tell me what this receipt is for , I 'll go . I 'll leave you alone . Anyone can fake a receipt . You feel something , I know it . Now , I need to get up to the purpose floor . I need you to make me a card . Mmm . Damn fine cake . You know who you kinda remind me of ? He looks like Two . Oh , you think so ? - Mmm-hmm . You could be a Two double . That 'd be a great job . Say , do you do a Two impersonation ? No , go ahead , say something in the Two vein . No , I-I am Two . No , really , I-I am Two . Hmm ... yeah .. You do look a bit like him , but Two 's got those death cold eyes . Hey , they 're comin ' here . I told you , you can 't be a man without a number here . It is all right , I am two . No , you tell them that , they will blow your head right off , come on . Knock-knock . How goes love 's young dream ? Always shining brightly , trembling with ardor . Oh , dear . Two ? Not today . Today , we are none of us , who we appear to be . I keep having this dream . Take your burden to the lord and leave it there . What if I were to tell you that there is another place ? What ? Would you care to see it ? What ? Would you dare to visit such a place ? I-I don 't know . Very well . Un-Two will grant your wish , whether you wish it or not . Wh-why are you doing this ? An imp of the perverse . I don 't wanna go anywhere . * The animals went two by two * * Hoorah hoorah * I don 't wanna go anywhere . I don 't wanna go anywhere . * animals go in two by two * * Hoorah * I thought I 'd lost you . - No . I just wanted to walk . You know , take it all in . I want to go to the other place . Oh , I don 't think so . Village is best for us . It is possible to go there . Yeah , but why would you want to when we have the village ? What did you see when you walked ? I saw what happens when I 'm awake . I saw the holes . But if that 's what it 's like , why don 't we leave ? Because ... On-only some people can go there , you know , to-to the other place . Who can go there ? Who ? - People that exist there . People-people that were brought here , that weren 't born here . People who weren 't born here ... Like me . - Yeah , but it 's enough , isn 't it ? No . Please , don 't-don 't go , don 't-don 't ... please , let .. just let us talk . I mean ... it 's our day . * The animals came two by two-two by two * * Hoorah * Are you hiding ? Not from me , I hope . You wish . Uh , which .. which one are you ? The one you can trust . Have you ever felt so alone , that you find yourself lost one day ? Have you ? - Shh ! I 'm sorry . Two-Times-Six will try to get close to your father . He will pose as Six . So , I must get to your father first before Two-Times-Six does . Where will Two be ? My father has gone out into the village . But you know where he 'll be ... where he might go . Yes . The village church . You know who I am , don 't you ? You are Two-Times-Six . And yet , you tell me where to find him . He wanted me to decide . I am decided . Are you Six ? If I was Two-Times-Six , you 'd know it by now . Yes . What have I done ? Yes , sit with me , hmm ? The world is not a pretty thing when you look at it too close . We fell in love with atrocity . We make pornography and call it news , a daily fix of horror . We think the coming disaster is going to be ecological , that the problem is political , but no , no , the great war is psychological . It 's in here .. We have made ourselves into fat and faded wheezing animals , educated in apathy , amused by cruelty . So , this ... We make a new world , something human . And yet , there is a whispering in my ear that tells me I was wrong , they were right , and the savages-savages-savages had it right all along . I wanted you to come . I wanted you to - to wipe out my guilt . You were right . You are the way .. Become hatred ! Become vengeance ! Yes , I respect that . Kill me . I see the logic in that . And I 'm not afraid , at all , because we know , you and I , how it is to be human . We must submit to the beast in man . I tell you this because I know who you are . You are not Six . Can you still kill me , if you understand the purpose ? Yes . Don 't give him what he wants . Oh , dear Six , you 're too late . If you do this , we are lost . He will take the thing that keeps him from owning us : our conscience . Words change nothing ! You hear me ? Words change nothin ' ! I know that .. I accept that . I have to accept you . Don 't make us become the thing we fear . If we are one , then we can defeat Two . One ? Come back . It was only when your father and I embarked on this adventure that-that I decided , Oh , I want .. that I realized what a beautiful thing it would be to have a child . We were gonna be a real family , together like this every day . Is there no other way ? Every time I wake up , these holes , just empty . Oh , look at us , the two of us . I .. Stay with .. Ugh ! Ah . Oh . Don 't you know the real Two when he is back amongst us ? Well , I like their enthusiasm . I thought they might knee me in the face and stamp on my brain . Still , perhaps another time . Let me tell you where you can properly direct your exuberance . Would you like me to tell you who our Two impersonator really is ? Oh , please - please , help me . They 've been saying I 've been impersonating Two . Purpose floor access granted . These people , they 're my subjects . Hey , that 's me . A lot of people trying to get in , ya know ? Is that me ? They 'd kill for my job . When did this happen ? How did it happen ? I started this . I found these people , and I put them into my reports . I did this . I 'm sorry . I have to go . What if I were to tell you that there is another place ? Nobody resigns from Summakor ... Nobody ! They 're selling tickets for your execution , Michael , but they 're calling it a promotion . Someone 's trying to get inside . There is a place , another place . Would you care to see it ? It 's where they sent them . It 's where they sent me .. and you . Whatever you do , stay away from Summakor . Hey ! Look up here !

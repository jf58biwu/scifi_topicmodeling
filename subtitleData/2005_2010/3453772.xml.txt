 There 's a warehouse in the desert . They 're building something there ... metal . - Who are you ? - My name 's winston . Where 's the metal ? I talked to your mom . She found something out in the desert . Is it real this time ? I detected this audio transmission On an unsecured line . Got a breach--man shot out at heat and air . Shut the place down ! You mind telling me where you keep your demolition materials ? God , I hate funerals . Mom , anybody who knew anything About the factory 's already dead . Well , I 'm not . Winston. did you know my husband , sarah ? The whole place was wired , every house in the neighborhood . Every move anyone ever made was being watched . Mom , you are tierd.You 've been sick . Chasing killer robots will do that to you . Midnight is the witching hour ... If you believe that kind of thing , And most people won 't admit it if they do . Midnight is the time when a door opens from our world Into the next , and we are visited By the dark spirits of the shadow lands . The incubus , the succubus , The old hag . Visitors are known by many names , But each story bears the same marks . The demons come after midnight In the first three hours of the new day When we are alone and vulnerable , Deep asleep and helpless , when we cannot move . They lay on us , press on us , suffocate us . Take from us what is most precious . Our lives , our love , our sanity . Our sleep . If you believe in that kind of thing . John ? Where are you ? In an industrial park near downtown . God , mom , it 's almost 12 : 00 . I was hoping you were asleep . Well , it didn 't take . What are you doing ? I got a lead off the surveillance tapes Of charm acers . And how many hours of people sleeping Did you have to watch ? All of them . So where are you ? Western iron and metal . They supply specialty metal tooling equipment To desert heat and air . And you think they 're connected to skynet ? You should get on the computer , Find out who owns the place . I 'm on it . Sarah . Sarah . Sarah , you had another nightmare . I can 't stay here anymore . You 've only been here one night . Feels a lot longer . We don 't have enough data To prescribe a treatment for your insomnia . The first night only establishes a baseline . I 'll be fine . You go home now , things 'll only get worse . You think two weeks without sleep is bad ? Try two or three years. it happens . Everyone needs their sleep . Not everyone . You do . I 'm gonna get you some coffee . But I have to warn you , This is a decaf-only facility , all right ? Can I help you ? Who are you ? I 'm your roommate. dana . When did you get here ? Checked in last night while you were asleep . Well , not really asleep . More like thrashing and screaming in your bed . What 's with the lighter ? What lighter ? The one in your bra . Trying to give up smoking . In a sleep clinic ? Yeah , I 've got sleep problems too . The doctors think it 's related to my chronic fatigue , Which they believe was caused by my eating disorder , Which is why I had the lap band surgery . You know , the stapling your stomach . But are the doctors satisfied with that ? No ! They wanna take away all my vices . Well , that 's not gonna happen . Girl 's gotta sin sometime . Hence , the smoking . Yeah , that and the younger men . Mom . Hey , tiger ! Hello . It 's visiting time. cameron 's in the cafeteria . Hey , do me a favor . Let 's keep this our little secret . There you go . Scrambled or hard boiled ? Uh ... scrambled . You need a carbohydrate that makes up At least 15 % of your daily allowance . Those won 't be as good as yours . You made pancakes ? I added a teaspoon of vanilla to your recipe . I don 't have a recipe . The recipe on the box . Not as good as hers ? Not as good as food . Tomorrow I 'll bring you something real to eat . They have anything to say ? About what ? About what ? about why you 're not sleeping . They figured out why ? Besides the fact the world 's about to end ? You used to sleep well . I shouldn 't be here . I should be at home . We 're fine at home. everything 's fine . This was a mistake . No , this ... this is necessary . Mom ... you 're useless like this . Look at yourself. you haven 't slept in two weeks . You fell down the stairs . If you don 't take care of yourself , Something worse might happen . You need to get better . I need you to get better . Don 't forget ... You 're not her . Please ... get some sleep . You--you 're dead . I killed you . And I killed you . One of us is gonna have to step it up . How You wanna know who I am ? That 's the first thing most people ask , First thing that comes out of their mouths When the gag comes off- - who are you ? And they keep asking it over and over again . Psychiatrists say Naming things gives people power over them . They 're dead wrong on that . I already know who you are . Oh , yeah , right . I forgot . And ... You found western iron and metal . Of course , I never expected anything less From the girl that used a cross-dresser And a hypnotherapist to find us . You know , I gotta admit , I didn 't see that one comin ' . You won 't see the next one coming either . Oh , I beg to differ , ma 'am . I beg to differ . So who do you work for ? I work alone . Somebody blew up our factory While you were getting patched up . Was that your boyfriend on the phone ? What are you guys , some kind of a ... Bonnie and clyde type operation ? I said , was that your client on the phone ? Why don 't you come closer , and I 'll tell you ? So you can bite my face off ? no . I don 't think so . See those seeds ? I go through about a bag in three hours . Little habit I picked up when I quit smoking . Before I finish that bag , you 're gonna talk . Special recipe . It 'll have you singin ' ... like sunday choir . What 's wrong ? gel too cold ? Most people don 't like the electrodes first time out . Makes ' em feel like frankenstein . You 'll get used to it . I 'm willing to bet you sleep better tonight . What 's happening to me ? Let me show you something . These are our observation machines . And , uh , this is your chart . There are five stages to the sleep cycle . The fifth stage is the most active- - Increased respiration rate , Blood pressure , brain activity . Rem sleep , when most dreaming occurs . It 's rare , but sometimes ... Night terrors like the ones you 're experiencing can- - I never said I was experiencing night terrors . You don 't have to . Your chart tells us everything we need to know . Night terrors can be caused by a brain tumor . Cancer . Which , as far as we can tell , you don 't have . Mri showed your brain was clear . No heart disease , nocturnal asthma or sleep apnea . What 's wrong with you is in your head . And by your head , I mean your mind . Therapy to reduce anxiety is part of the usual treatment . Have you ever ... seen a therapist ? A lot of people find talking one-on-one To be very helpful in breaking down what 's really going on . Tried it. didn 't take . How ' bout a prescription ? diazepam usually helps . Don 't like drugs . Speaking of drugs ... Has your roommate been smoking again ? I 'm not interested in being anybody 's mother . I 've got two kids of my own , and that 's enough- - Did you know about this ? Besides all the other obvious hazards , Nicotine is a stimulant . Hits the brain in seven seconds And adds 20 heartbeats per minute . I quit smoking years ago . I 've got too much excitement in my life . Yeah , don 't we all ? Well , I have to file a report on this . I 'll be back later to attach your electrodes . It 's a dream catcher . It 's supposed to catch nightmares . Hector made me one too . Hector ? The cleaning guy . You know , papi chulo with the neck tattoo ? You look tired . You should take that as a compliment . I ran into nurse ratched in the hallway . She smacked my bum for the cigarette And gave me some sleeping pills . The good stuff . So ... what about you ? Drowning , being chased , teeth falling out ? Being chased should probably cover it . You 're running away from something You don 't want to deal with . At least that 's what they say , anyway . And you ? Oh , I burn alive . Yeah , my whole body just--phooh--catches fire . I try and I try . I can 't put myself out . Anxiety about quitting smoking . Yeah , that ... or I was a witch in another life . They say if you die in your dreams , You die in real life . Oh , I 've died a thousand times . Never gets any easier . Of all the nightmares it 's caught , I 'm surprised it hasn 't spilled them out All over the bed . Do the bad guys ever catch you ? That 's a ... quite a collection . Bullet wounds , stabbings . Emergency c-section . But that 's plenty old , that last one . Your child must be ... 15 , maybe 20 by now ? They 'll kill you ... Just like they killed everyone else . They ? Your bosses , kaliba . They blew up your factory , Killed 30 of their own people . Lady , you 're insane . Why would anyone blow up their own factory ? To hide what you were building . And what was that ? The end . You are very ... dramatic . Diana ... Thought you were a good man . What do you think she 'd say if she saw you now ? You ... Leave my wife out of this ... You crazy ... bitch . Dana ? Dana , wake up . Dana , wake up . Your electrodes came off last night . Did you take them off ? I don 't remember . Are you a sleepwalker ? It 's happened once or twice . You didn 't mention that in your intake . Must have slipped my mind . I 'm sorry . So you don 't remember getting out of bed last night . I don 't remember anything . Salvador Dali often explored the subconscious In the dream world in his work . Are your dreams like this painting ? Everyone 's dreams are different . Guess it depends on what 's stuck in your head .

Hey , hey , be careful- - Yes , thank you . John . What 's wrong ? Something strange is going on here . Like what ? I woke up last night And saw the nurse giving my roommate a shot . Okay , well , it 's a medical clinic . So what 's strange about that ? She was passed out when she gave her the injection . She had already taken sleeping pills . So ... you think the nurse is , uh ... What , like the angel of death ? After she gave her the shot , She went downstairs to a room in the basement . Well , she looks all right . She 's not . No one is . Mom ... Did you sleep last night ? You think I 'm making this up ? No . I don 't think you 're making this up . It 's just ... You 're a mess . Don 't be fooled , john . Don 't be fooled by anyone 's face . You don 't know what 's behind anyone 's face . You talking about the guy at the factory ? The one who shot you ? the one you shot ? We don 't talk about that . We can talk about anything . No , we can 't . Is he the one in your nightmares ? It 's always the same . He comes out of nowhere. he grabs me . Takes me hostage in a van . What does he want ? To know who I am , who I 'm working with . He has me tied up , drugged . He isn 't real . He can 't hurt you anymore . He 's in my head . I can 't get him out . Look at me . You did what you had to do . You defended yourself . I 'm not supposed to defend myself . I 'm supposed to defend you . Nap time . Oh , don 't worry. we 'll get her to close her eyes . Come on . My wife ... What was she wearing ... At my funeral ? Black . Hair ... down or back ? Down , and earrings , pearls . I bought those for her birthday . Your salary must be good . It 's the best part of the job . And the worst ? You saw the tapes . Yeah . - So you know . - yes . First one was the hardest . Frank ? Your neighbor. his son played lacrosse . He borrowed my lawnmower ... Every Friday . He never cleaned the bag . Why would they want him dead ? He kept the books . Handled the overseas business . He was a drunk . Overseas. so your bosses are foreign . They fixed me up after you shot me . Put me in a private clinic . And I thought it was because they were ... Being kind . Then I realized ... They were just patching me up so I could do my job . What 's your job ? Like I said ... First one was the hardest . You were my first . You seem surprised . I just ... I just figured a badass gal like yourself- - Never . I 'm ... glad I didn 't break your streak . I can help you disappear , you and your wife . They 'll hunt us down. they 'll slaughter us . There are ways to keep ' em off your trail , Things I 've learned . Like what ? You ditch the van. get a new car . Check into an expensive hotel , The most expensive you can find . They 'll always expect the opposite . You have my phone . When I get back to my people , I 'll call you . But we have to move fast So they don 't know what 's happening . Her smell . It 's what I miss the most . Like clean laundry . Didn 't see that one comin ' ... hmm ? Dana . - Get out of the room . - Dana ! Get out of the room ! She 's in there ! she 's in there ! Get her out of the room ! she 's in there ! She 's in there ! come on ! Hello ? Remember I told you something strange was going on ? Uh , the--the nurse . My roommate 's dead . She died last night in a fire . They 're trying to claim it 's some kind of accident . Okay , maybe you 're right. maybe you should come home . No , not now . First of all , I 'd like to give you an update On dana 's condition . There 's a rumor going around the clinic That she didn 't pull through . That 's not the case . Dana is in extremely critical condition , But she is still alive . This has been a traumatic experience For all of us . Patients , if you choose to leave the clinic , You may return at any time to complete your treatment . However , it would be of great value to us , And we think to you , If we were allowed to evaluate your sleep patterns During this time of duress . Whatever you choose , we fully support your decision . Miss baum . I hear you 've decided to stay . I have . An incident like this increases cortisol levels . You may find it even more difficult to sleep tonight . Here . These should help . Diazepam . Like I said , standard treatment for insomnia . You should take them now . Good . I 've been meaning to say thank you . For the dream catcher . You make them for all the patients ? Just the ones who need ' em . The ones who have nightmares . Did you know her well ? You know , she ain 't dead . Right. sorry . She kept saying she dreamt she died in a fire . Maybe I shoulda made her a bigger one , huh ? A nightmare didn 't burn her. a cigarette did . She shoulda taken charge . Taken charge ? Of what was goin ' on inside her head . Controlled it . You believe it then ? Course I do . Coyote. does it have mystical significance ? Does it protect you , guide you ? This ? no . It 's just for my girl . She thinks it 's sexy . Tell me a story . Go to hell . What most people know about torture 's bullcrap . It 's not the pain that causes people to talk . It 's the talking that causes people pain . So tell me a story . You told me a story once in the warehouse , A story about your son . That 's when you let me go . Thinking back on it , it 's funny . You don 't strike me as the sentimental type . Your story , not mine . Yeah , but you believed it . You believed it ... Because you have a child . I 've seen your scar . My story is your story . That 's why you told it back to me When I asked you for one . This is what is important . This is who you 're protecting . You have a son . He 's your accomplice . See ? I was alarmed . So your son is your accomplice . You 're not bonnie. you 're ma barker . He 's just a boy . A boy you 'd die to protect . Any mother would . You 'd be surprised . The enemy 's like a weed . You leave any part of it underground , It 'll pop right back up when you least expect it . You gotta kill the root . Or in this case ... the seed . You won 't get anywhere near him . He 's not alone . I won 't have to . You 're his mother . He 'll come to you . He won 't come anywhere near here . He knows better . He will . He will when you ask him . We don 't need to talk anymore . I won 't call him . I 'll die first . You 'd like that ... to die . But it 's never that easy , is it ? Hey. hey , wake up . You okay ? you called me . The nurse. she gave me a shot . Some kind of sedative . Let 's get outta here . No , she 's gonna keep hurting people . We have to do something . Think you can hack the combination ? In my sleep . It 's some kind of scanning program . It 's neural activity , brain scans . There 's files , thousands of them . Am I in there ? I don 't know. it 's by patient number . All right , there 's a ton of data on you . It 's a whole profile . Delete it. all of it . It 's a skynet experiment , john. they 're stealing everything . Mom- - Sleep is the perfect cover . Your brain 's still active , but you don 't remember a thing . They run a sleep clinic . They 're not people. would you get rid of it ? Nurse hobson ? There 's a problem in room 22--no data . Miss baum 's electrodes must have slipped off again . Thank you for explaining . Is that everything ? Almost . - I don 't want a trace of me left . - I know . All of it , john. all of it , get rid of it . I don 't want any of me left in there . All right , it 's gone . It 's all gone , okay ? you 're all gone . Whatever she gave me is starting to hit . This is a restricted area. how did you get in here ? I don 't know . I must have been sleepwalking . Through a locked door ? Sorry . I 'll go back to my room . Did you know ... That when a human falls in love , The same areas of the brain light up As when a human is intoxicated ? What does that have to do with my nightmares ? We don 't know yet . We don 't fully understand why humans need to dream . Humans like you ? You drugged me . What you 're experiencing is sleep paralysis . You want to move , but you can 't . Believe it or not , Your body is actually protecting you right now . You were talking to someone when I entered the room . Your boy. the one who came to visit . Call to him . I 'd die first . I 'm sure you 'd like that ... to die . It 's never that easy . What is this thing ? Mom . What are you ? John ! John . It 's her son . He 's the one who helped her blow up the facility . He 's the one we want . We 'll give him a few more hours to show up . I don 't know. maybe three . She gave me a few problems. nothing I couldn 't handle . Yeah , I guess we don 't need her anymore . No. you can trace her cell phone to this location Even without her alive . Makes no difference to me . It 's not a problem . I 'll take care of it right now . Hell ... it 's what she wants . You 're real . You 're real ! you 're real ! A spirit sits on a man 's chest . She is strong , beautiful . She is here to steal his children . She is here to steal his future . He is paralyzed . The terror in him will burst his heart if he cannot control it . She is a nightmare , a demon woman , The oldest and most enduring story told by man . The witching hour is controlled by witches . She is a bad dream . She is a bad bitch .

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Whoever stole the sword has other things that belong in the Warehouse , which would mean that we have competition . Lattimer and Bering , right ? They 're so raw , so untrained , so corruptible . - What about your folks ? - Colorado springs . They own a bookstore called Bering Sons . He must be proud . You ever see that movie The Great Santini ? With the tough dad and the scared kids . It 's like that ? Yeah , except it wasn 't over in two hours . Oh , my . Artie , I 'm here . In MacPherson 's apartment . Myka , be careful . MacPherson 's gone . It 's another dead end . - Found him ! - Pete 's luckier in Montreal . How much better ? MacPherson 's headed east on Sainte-Catherine ! I 've got the cops on me ! I 'll get rid of the cops . You just stay on MacPherson . There 's an alley on the right heading to the subway . We got him , Artie . Be careful , Pete . We do not know if he have them . Give it up , MacPherson . We win this one . Artie , he has the cymbal . He has the cymbal ! You 've gotta get out of there ! If you see the cymbals , cover your ears . Pete ? Artie ? What happened ? Is everything okay ? Pete , can you hear me ? Pete , you 've got to get up . Mom , I 'm up . I won 't be late . I 'm okay . I managed to cover my ears . Where is he ? Where 's MacPherson ? He 's gone , Artie . I lost him . I lost MacPherson . Mom , I 'm busy right now . I can 't really ... Myka , it 's your father . He started feeling bad and I ... What ? Just come on home . Just come back , just come home . We 've got to wrap it up . Artie , I need to go home . I 'm going home . My father is dying . Projet-SG ( 1.00 ) Dude ! Does Tamara know you 're stalking her ? Or is this just for makeup tips ? Give it back , Greg . Boo-hoo , baby . Yeah , I don 't know , Leena . It 's complicated . MacPherson put decoys and bogus informational breadcrumbs ... put them all over the world , and my software narrowed him down to two locations , and Montreal turned out to be , you know , the one that was ... Did you say you wanted no ice in your ... God ! Don 't do that , Mrs. Frederic . What 'd you do with Leena ? Sorry . Would you care for a ... No . You 're here because you want to know what happened . Two policemen dead , Arthur . I know what happened . The Montreal police have a dashboard camera in the car . But I told Pete . He had the recording ... Please . We were following a lead . You took a shot in the dark . - We hit the center of that target . - With a small-caliber bullet . Pete 's caliber is very large . You know what ? I 'm done with this analogy . We had an agreement . You were supposed to gather information ... Bring it to me ... And we would plan to get MacPherson together . You had no offensive strategy . No defensive posture . No containment plan . You were not prepared . Where 's Lattimer and Bering ? Out . Manage my assets better , or I swear on the ashes of the first 12 warehouses , I will take them away . - I can get MacPherson again . - I don 't doubt it . You make no moves against him without consulting me first . Yes , ma 'am . Do you have ... How did she do that ? All right , everyone . Please close your booklets , ladies and gentlemen . Tamara , can you gather them up , please ? Okeydoke . John Steinbeck 's East of Eden . Betrayal . Lost love , jealousy . Good stuff . Please read the first 50 pages , for discussion tomorrow . If you would . Have a good one . Bobby , can you come here for a sec ? You okay ? You seem a little distracted . Computer lab thing . Up late . Did you talk to her yet ? I 've got something for you . - Thanks , Tamara . - No problem . Poetry . Burns , Blake , Byron . That 's just the Bs . Let them do the talking for you . Good luck . Mom . Mom ? - Mom . - Myka ! Your cell phone isn 't working , and I tried calling , but ... - The battery died . Where 's he ? - He 's fine . Don 't worry . He 's upstairs . Go up and see him . Sorry I 've scared you . But he 's fine , now . Yep . A wasted trip , kiddo . You bring a gun in here ? Yeah , it 's packed downstairs , disassembled . I thought you were in the hospital . you were dying . Your mother overreacted . I 'm fine . It 's not a stroke ? Not a stroke . We 've got a few more tests , but ... - You should have heard him screaming . - I didn 't scream . I 've never screamed in my life ! Do you remember what happened ? No , I don 't remember anything , except waking up in the ambulance , wondering what the fuss was all about . - Jeannie , get the girl some food . - Mom , I 'm not hungry . It 's because you 've starved your hunger nerve to death . The doctor said it might be a virus . You 're too skinny . An inner ear or spinal inflammation . They got him on steroids and an antiviral . Mrs. B. I am gonna need this recipe . The hot sauce is killer . Great ! You 've got some ... - Look at you . - Sorry . - We 've met Pete . - He 's a pip . - Just got here . Met your dad . - Are these yours ? Found them in the kitchen . Yeah . I 'm so sorry . They 're ... for collecting evidence . I 'm sorry . - What are you doing here ? - I thought you might need the support . Artie disagreed but was overruled . - By who ? - By me . - The pip . - I don 't need any support . Miss Independent , me neither . Seriously , dad . I 've been here for , like what ? - A minute ? - Miss touchy , too . Please , Warren . I 've got to go down to the basement . - Eat something ! - I 'm not hungry . Well ... I 'm going to get that guest room ready . And for your bed , I 've got some new flannel sheets I got at Dodie 's . You are my guests . It 's ' my house . You 're my guests . What about work ? Well , work vanished . And until it reappears , I 'm here as a friend , in this hopefully not too stressful time . It could have been worse , right ? Your dad ? Thank you . No , I 'm ... I appreciate it , and you 're right . It could have been worse . Wait ! Myka ! I was talking to your dad . He thinks you 're still in DC . They both do . Well , yeah . And if you tell them any differently , I swear I will drop a dictionary on your crotch . I 'm supposed to tell them that I 'm working for the world 's most dangerous antiques road show ? You tell them the truth . Or at least , part of the truth . - Something to cut the stress . - I 'm not stressed . You 're lying to them . It 's a force of habit , you know ? It keeps me from being disappointed . You have hot sauce all over your face . Dad ! Mom ? Get back . Watch your eyes . Warren . - What happened ? - What happened is ... your dad 's got an artifact . - Where 's the notebook ? - It 's this way . - It 's okay . - Who is it ? Is she ... This is Claudia . We work with her . What 's that ? That is ... - Back here . - That 's for me . No , you wait just a minute . I want some answers . - Who 's the man in the little TV ? - His name is Artie . - Is he a doctor ? - No , but ... - Your father belongs in a hospital . - This isn 't medical . This is something else . And how do you know ? You 're not a doctor . - You protect the president . - Not anymore . I 'm still with the government , but I am doing this now . What ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to help Dad . So just let me do that . Trust me . Please . - Ready ? - Yeah . Just stay here . Whatever you see or hear , just stay put . Just don 't move . It 'll be okay . They do this kind of stuff all the time , so ... - I gotta ... - But what 's going on ? They 're really good at this . Here it is . Kill it . Duck and cover . What 's happening ? How 's Dad ? He 's the same . Why ? Was something supposed to happen ? Check his arms . It 's still there . It 's ink . Ink . Take it out . Now what ? The neutralizer failed because I think we 're dealing with a bifurcated object . It 's got at least two parts , and they 're each dependent on the other . And that notebook is just one half - of the package . - So what 's the other half ? Based on the manifestations of the ink , that would tell me it 's a pen , most like ... well , a pen , anyway . By the way , the shipper 's address ? That 's completely phony . MacPherson sent it , didn 't he ? - I don 't know that . - So what ? He 's coming after family now ? - What does he want ? - He wants to hurt us , - because we 're going after him . - Stop . Just stop it . We don 't know who sent it or why . If it is MacPherson , it could be revenge or mischief or a diversion so that we 're doing this while he 's doing something else . Just in case , just to be safe , I 've ... I 'm circling the wagons around Joshua and around Pete 's family . Who or why does not matter . What matters is your father and the notebook . Now , listen . I 've analyzed the text . It ain 't good . It 's Poe . Edgar Allan Poe . The reason that the book is getting under your father 's skin is because the pen is not with it . So , what ? We bring the pen together with the notebook - and this all stops ? - Yeah . Well , probably , if it follows a typical bifurcated artifact scenario . It can 't be an accident that this book found its way to your Dad . Look , right now your father is a conduit . The notebook , the pen , are linked through his energy , through his love of the written word . So where is this pen ? Well , I 'm searching for coinciding incidents right now . - You know , I 've got the filters off . - But it 's causing trouble somewhere ? I 'll find it . You 'll get it . Next time he has an attack , I 'll trace the pen . You 'll retrieve it - and reunite it with the notebook . - How long does he have ? - I don 't know what ... how long what ? - How long does he have ? My father can 't take this much longer . A day . Maybe two . But you can help him . Until I land on something , just ... surround him with his books , with his world , and read to him , read to him books that he loves and use those words to fight what 's happening to him . And just try to keep him connected to reality if you can . - Bobby 's not that bad . - Look , all I 'm saying is , watch out . Geek love . Ugh ! " I might have been improved for my whole life . " I might have been made another creature , perhaps , for life , by a kind word , at that season ... " Do you want me to take over ? - No , no . I 'm fine . He 's gonna be okay , mom . I 'll be back in a sec . I 'm just gonna take these dishes . Freak 's probably swiped your panties from gym class or something . Gross ! Tiger . Dad ? Tiger ... stop it . Fire . - Dad ? - Fire ! Dad ? Help ! Somebody get some help ! Artie 's got something . - What ? - At the precise moment your dad was shouting " fire , " a kid in Portland , Oregon , was burned by some ... bizarre wall of flame shooting from his locker . No one can explain it . Well , what about the tiger thing ? Kid 's a football star for the Kingford Tigers . Let 's go . Wait , Myka . I need you to stay here . I have to help my dad , Pete . I know , but we 've got two artifacts . He 's connected to one . I need you to stay on the notebook . I 'll take care of the pen . Myka , look at me . No one can help your dad right now more than you can . I can 't let you go alone . I 'll take Claudia . Keep her safe . But there 's something else . What ? I think I 'm hot for your mom . I 'll break it to dad . I needed to speak with you , Bobby . Is everything okay ? The poetry inspiring you ? Not so much . You know , it seems we had a little burglary here the other day . The story is that it was one of the pens that Edgar Allan Poe used . He used it . Don 't look at me like that . I noticed that you were ... fascinated with the pen . Are you saying I took it ? Are you saying I took it ? I 'll tell you what . I 'm gonna go to the lounge for a soda , and if the pen should show up while I 'm gone , we 'll just chalk it up to something strange and mysterious . Back in a bit . Here . " Wall " ? " Wall " ? - " Wall " what ? - You . Young man burns weren 't serious but them kept him out football practice . He does have a reputation for scaring people . Really ? Does he like horror novels ? Stephen King , Lovecraft , Poe ? You 're assuming the boy reads . No , he 's just a bully . Look , I mean , how big a deal is this ? I mean , this school 's got a reputation to maintain , and if it gets out that the government 's investigating a teenage prank , it 'll put a lot of parents off . You mean donors ? - Why do you think it 's just a prank ? - We 're not schooling terrorists here . Somebody in the science class got tired of parmut picking on him and gave him a hotfoot . Yeah ? How 's he doing ? He 's fine . You want this open ? No . We 'll ... we 'll take it from here . You 'll want to step back , please . - Why ? It 's not dangerous . - Please . Thank you . - You ready ? - Why not ? Okay , we 're in business . Here we go . - So , you had any other incidents ? - With what , fire ? Anything strange . Say a tell-tale heart , perhaps ? What ? There you go . Gotta love Artie . What 's that ? You don 't happen to have Edgar Allan Poe 's pen lying around ? - Well , actually ... - Yes ? Mr. Ives ' classroom . He likes to collect items from famous people . The pen is here , then . Well , it was . It got stolen . This last one was the worst . I know . Dad ? If you 'd been a boy I 'd have called you Sue . What ? Johnny Cash . It 's a song . A boy named Sue . Make you tough . Well , I 'm sorry I wasn 't a boy . I 'm sorry I wasn 't a father . He has regrets . About me ? About his life . What do you mean ? He wanted to write books . I know . I know that he wanted to write books . Did you know he wrote a novel ? 12 times . Over and over again . Unpublished . He loved it too much to let it go . He was afraid . Where is it ? A long time ago , when he finally gave up , he told me to burn it . He hasn 't written a thing since . Come on , Pete . Mr. Ives ? Hello ? Nice place for a pen , soaking up all that Poe juice . Do you know that ravens are actually brilliant ? They 've adapted to humans like rats and cockroaches . They 've figured out how to figure us out . What ? Hear anything ? - Just the beating of my hideous ... - Stop it . Listen . - What is that ? - A rat in the wall ? - Short story . - Guy walled up . - The Cask ... - ... of Amontillado . - Here , take if off there . - I don 't want avian flu ! - Take it ! - All right ! What do I ... Mr. Ives ? Who did this to you ? Find him . Stop him . Not cool . Myka , something 's wrong . Artie , I need help . - What 's this ? - A poem . I wrote it for you . I gotta go . - We 're losing him . - Myka , just read to him . Read it . I have read . I 've read him everything , okay ? It 's not working . You have to find the words that he loves . You have to find a book that means more to him than ... than anything in the world . Mom , tell me you didn 't burn it . - What ? - Dad 's book . Aunt Cindy 's bureau . The bottom drawer . Okay , so Ives said that Bobby had a crush on what 's her name ? - Tamara . - Tamara , right . There 's always a girl . Don 't blame her . Blame testosterone . Crazy , crazy man hormone . I 'm not blaming the girl . I 'm blaming Poe . Crazy , scary man hormone . Check out Miss Teenage Zombie . Tamara , was it ? Right ? That 's a nice pen . Why don 't you ... give it up , huh ? Come on , give it here . " Pendulum " ? You 've gotta be kidding me . I got it . Bobby , you 've gotta stop this . I know you 're all full of Poe , up to your creepy eyeballs in " Nevermore " and crap , but ... But this isn 't fiction ! It 's real ! This is the most real I 've ever felt in my entire life . " The blue willow sky " by Warren Bering . Chapter One . " When the girl was born , his first thought was fear . " - It 's beautiful . - You 're a good person , but you 're ... You 're hurting people ! You 're hurting yourself and Tamara , and it has to stop ! People like you don 't see me . You don 't believe in me . People like you need to be shocked into seeing . You need to be horrified . - Then you 'll understand . - Understand what , Bobby ? Tell me what ! That words have power . " For her . " " For his daughter . She was his life . " But this isn 't fiction ! It 's real ! " She was his life . " " His only job now was keeping her safe . " " She was his life . " It 's working , Myka . Words have power . Something 's happening . Go , go , Claudia ! Get the pen . Who are you ? What ? - One second . Nice , Claud . - Here 's the bag . Get him to a hospital . This still has a hold on him ! And Myka 's dad ! Myka ! I got it . How is he ? - Is that it ? - That 's it . He 's not worse , but he 's not better . Not completely . His strength is the only thing that 's keeping that pen from flipping completely out . The notebook 's in place . Good . Take the pen , keep it in the bag , and just , you know , approach the notebook . - I 'm on it . - Be careful ! I am ! Would you stop yelling at me ? Somebody turn down his volume or something . Now what ? Put the bag right over the notebook , turn it upside down , dump the pen out , make sure it lands on the notebook and stays there . That 's it ? Just dump it out ? Just lay it on the notebook ? This isn 't Cirque du Soleil ! Just dump the pen and stand back ! All right ! Nothing 's happening . That 's okay . It 's all right , it 's fine . It 's been a while since they 've been together . Probably they 're just getting reacquainted . Wait , wait . Dad ? What 's this ? What , did I doze off ? Sort of . I was dreaming ... you were reading and ... You didn 't burn it ? I did . I think I 've got everything . Honey ? Hey , I don 't know what it is you do for a living , but you do it very well , and I mean that . I 'll see you soon , and we 'll talk . We 'll talk about something other than books . - Oh , mom . - Good-bye , honey . Thank you so much . And you take care of Pete . I always do . Got everything ? Called the cab ? I didn 't . I think , Mr. Poe , that when your things arrive , we 'll stick them in ... the Madrid section ... That is if Leena agrees . Pete and Myka are in Colorado Springs . Yeah , I know . I should have tried ... And so is MacPherson . What ? How did he ... He was there the whole time ? He had us all distracted . I think that was MacPherson 's intent . - I 'll take the Farnsworth . - Good choice . We 're heading home . Listen ! That was weird . - Hold on . - Vibe ? Huge . Your dad . What ? Is this Poe ? Are we back into the Poe thing again ? I don 't know ... You two are good . I see why Mrs. Frederic drafted you . I kill this , and it 's lights out for mom and dad . You hurt my father . He glimpsed the mind of one of the greatest authors in the world . - He 'll thank me later . - Oh , you 'll be dead later . What do you want ? I want what you risked your lives to get . I would have done it myself , but I lacked the means . You have until a count of one . You came after family . Arthur started it . What is that supposed to mean ? Ask him . Now let them go . Do it ! Thank you . Consider it a loan . What the hell was that ? Jack the Ripper 's lantern . At least we know where that is now . He used us from the very beginning . He used me .

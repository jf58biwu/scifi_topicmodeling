 Destiny ... The design is clearly ancient , launched hundreds of thousands of years ago . Where the hell are we ? Several billion light years from home . We 're on a ship , but we have no idea where we are in relation to Earth . This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the Stargate itself . These are the wrong people in the wrong place . We 've got a lot of wounded . We need to get home . We barely have enough power to operate the main systems . This ship simply doesn 't have the capability to dial Earth . Even if we can get the life support working , we don 't have much food and water . Then go get some . Little boys playing soldier . Well , I 'm sorry , I 've no interest in playing that game ... I 'm not playing anything , I 'm trying to save the lives of everyone aboard that ship . We do have power issues to be aware of . If I wasn 't being clear , I was giving you an order . Dr. Rush ... Dr. Rush , I was wondering if ... Not now ! What are you doing ? Good morning . Colonel young asked us to figure out how ... I turned these systems off for a reason . They need to stay off ! Don 't know whether the ship has electrolyzed it to produce oxygen , but you can see there 's not much left in there . We did some calculations based on our estimates of the water depth and tank dimensions . And the winner is ? Just over 90,000 liters . 91,046 . Ish . Go , math boy . Sounds like a lot . It wouldn 't fill a backyard swimming pool . Still , it 's enough to loosen the rationing restrictions , isn 't it ? Camile , I think I know where you 're going with this , and believe me when I say that I , too , could use a shower . I don 't think the showers use water . They just spray a sort of mist that you kind of stand in , and it sorta beads up ... There 's one in a compartment off the crew quarters . How do you know all that if you haven 't tried it ? How do you know I haven 't tried it ? Oh , we know . Thank you , Lieutenant Rosegarden . No , he 's right . You 're worse than he is . Wow , you can tell them apart ? We also identified a recycling system for liquid waste , so once we get that system up and running ... Okay , folks , let 's have a better day than yesterday . Thank you . Your ration , sir . Thank you . I ordered you here 20 minutes ago . I 've been working . Throughout the night , actually , trying to find out why our power reserves are so low . I 'm quite concerned , and so should you be . Okay , well , how bad is it ? I haven 't been able to access Any of the main systems yet , so I don 't know . You look exhausted . Maybe you should take a break . Get the information we need and make some informed decisions , and we report ... Could you please stop people running around activating every bloody system they can get their hands on ? I will . That was delicious . Thank you very much . That man is a lot of work . Let 's bring in the next one , please . Doctor , I 'm very sorry to bother you . I know you 're busy , but I really need your ... Come on , it doesn 't have to be profound . Just who you are and ... and something you want to say . Like , hi , I 'm Eli Wallace , I 'm 25 years old , I 'm currently unemployed , and just for posterity 's sake , I 'd like to say , take your stinking paws off me , you damn dirty ape ! That 's just an example . I 'm not really going to say that . Just ... just try it . Just say something . Well , it could be that Rush is just starting a fire , so he can put it out , or it could be that he 's so far ahead of us he can see problems that none of us can see . So , what do you want us to do ? Help him . The man likes to work alone . Well , with the way he 's been treated , you can hardly blame him . I can blame him all day long . It 's pretty hard not to , considering . This isn 't helpful . Yeah , well , it 's the truth . Well , we 're stuck with Rush for now . Scott is checking out the other shuttle , seeing if it 's operational . He asked that you two join him when we were done here , so off you go . Dismissed . Please tell me that 's everyone . We still have the question of what to do with the Senator 's body . Yeah , we 'll get to him . He 's not going anywhere . I 'd appreciate a file on everyone by sometime tomorrow . Nothing fancy . My assignment , sir ? Recipes , Becker . For the love of God , recipes . 2nd Lieutenant Vanessa James . 26 . Air Force Special Forces . All I have to say is ... I don 't want to die out here . Colonel ! I thought we were done . There are still dozens of human resources issues we need to talk about . Pick one . The matter of Lieutenant Johansen resigning her commission . Consider her reactivated . Well , I don 't know if that 's up to ... Up to me ? Yeah , it is . We need a medic . I don 't even know why she resigned in the first place . Well , that 's none of my business . Colonel , look what we figured out . We 're calling it a recharging plate . Uh-huh . We 've tweaked it so it works with Earth technology . For now , we have to be careful not to leave them on the plate for too long , or it fries the battery , but ... not bad , huh ? It 's great . Isn 't it ? Turn it off . Why ? Well , Rush says we have power issues . We 've got all these things to recharge . But as soon as he gives the go-ahead , you kids can go crazy . For now , help me pass the word to stop pushing buttons . It 's cool , guys . This one 's secure . You think you can fly this thing , man ? I can fly an F-302 . Yeah , in a simulator . This is a real spaceship , man . Yes , it is . So ... pretty screwed up , huh ? Yeah . Yeah , pretty screwed up . You think they 're going to work it out ? We 're pretty freakin ' far from home , man , I don 't know . Not today . You should have shipped out weeks ago , T.J. It 's not right . It ain 't right at all . Yeah , well ... I 'm here , so what do you want us to do ? Help me figure out what kind of bird we got here . I just radioed Brody to come down , help translate the controls . Took me half an hour just to find the " on " switch . Maybe we can take a little joyride , huh ? Oh , joy . You don 't have to follow me around . What do you mean ? I mean that I 'm okay . Thank God you said something , because I thought you were following me around , and it was about to get awkward . I don 't mind the company . I just don 't want to keep you from anything important . Oh , I am done with important . I 'm taking the day off from important . You should . So should you . Me ? I don 't even know what to do with myself , Eli . I 'm the last person who should be here . I 'm second to last . You 're underestimating yourself . So are you . Can you show me how to use that shower you were talking about ? Yes . Yes , I can . Scott 's checking out the shuttle , seeing if it 's operational . Everyone else is holding the work until you give the green light . Thank you . Look , I want you to know that I 'm well aware that in the field of ancient technology , or pretty much any other subject I can think of , you 're the best I 've got . But we can 't be working at cross purposes . All I ask is that you check with me before issuing orders ... check with you ? No , no , you see , you got it backwards . If you 're doing something , I want to know what it is , and this is not a request . Done . Fine . I 'll tell you everything . If there is an issue that affects everybody on this ship , like we 're running out of power ... I think I already told you that . I 'm not here to snap you back or piss you off , but if we 're going to be on this ship for any length of time , we need to be on the same page . I think our length of time together on Destiny may be shorter than you think . Okay . Uh-huh ? I get it . Who can I bring in to help ? Honestly , it may take longer than we 've got to bring someone else up to speed ... Volker it is . Perfect , terrific . You can tell him to sit on his hands if you want to . Spencer , Sergeant . I 'm 31 . All I want to say is I never asked for this . All I want is ... to get off this ship . What 's it feel like ? What ? What 's it feel like on your bare skin ? It 's really warm ! Yeah ? Eli ... I 'm just standing guard ! Anybody could walk in . I ... what ? Whatever . I need to talk to you . Um ... Alone . It 's important . Wow , I am so torn . Chloe , I 'm going to take Eli for a minute . That all right with you ? Okay ! I 'll check back with you later , okay ? Okay ! Hey , heard you could use a helper . Well , you heard wrong . Yeah , young said not to take no for an answer . If he wanted to be helpful , he would have sent Eli instead . Well , thank you for that , but Eli 's a kid , really , and I 'm an astrophysicist , so ... Mr. Volker , I neither need nor want your help , all right ? Look , he 's just going to drag me right back in here , and you know it . Come on . Right , I 'm concerned that Destiny is on the verge of losing power . Look for yourself . This ship 's been flying around for the better part of a million years . I know . So I don 't understand why all of a sudden ... we showed up and started doing things , how about that ? Like what ? Dialing back to Earth , for one ! Oh , come on , we had to try . Look out a window , man . We 're flying faster than the speed of light . How close to the end of our rope can we be ? You 're obviously not capable of seeing the signs . Okay , well , speaking of signs , when was the last time you slept ? Look , if you know what you 're looking for , there are clear indications power is being channeled into life support and away from ... How can you know that ? We 're still completely locked out of the core systems . Out ! Okay , forget I said anything ... - Now ! - I 'll just work quietly ... Well , it 's too bloody late for that , isn 't it ? I told him you 'd be a waste of time ! A waste of time that we can ill afford ! If you can 't see the signs staring you in the face , then you 're no good to me ! Get out ! Look ... we just want to talk . You said " alone . " Well , how else was I supposed to get you out of there ? What 's going on , Eli ? You mean right now ? Don 't be an idiot . Wow , you must be getting to know me , because I respond really well to that . We can 't get a straight answer from anybody about whether or not we 're going to make it back to Earth . I don 't think anybody knows . They don 't know , or won 't tell us ? I 'm pretty sure if they knew , they would tell you . They 'd tell you . Me ? Are you serious ? Yeah , we are , Eli . You 're on the inside . Rush needs you , the Colonel 's looking out for you . Okay ... tell you what , if they tell me , then I 'll tell you . That 's all we ask . That 's it ? Great . This has been good . I think as a group , we 've bonded . You , uh ... you got to be kidding me . I know . You were in there five minutes . He kicked me out . What 's the matter with you ? You 're a grown man . I know that , but he said out . What the hell did you say to the man ? I didn 't say anything ! I was just trying to figure out what his problem was . It 's our problem , Volker , it 's not just his . I need you to get your ass back in there . I 'm telling you , he 's gone crazy . Well , we already knew that . Go . This isn 't the old crazy , this is a whole new crazy . Would you like me to hold your hand , is that it ? Is that what you need me to do ? Colonel , I 'm trying ... All right , here we go . Let 's do this . I 'll take you there myself , and for God 's sake , Volker , if you people can 't stand up to the son of a bitch , I ... Did you do that , Rush ? Is that what you think ? No ... no , I didn 't , but I have been standing here for the past few minutes watching systems fail all over the ship , and there 's nothing that I could do to stop that . The FTL drive was amongst the last to go . We could be in range of a Stargate . You see what I mean ? No , there 's no countdown . There 's got to be emergency reserves . I don 't think you seem to understand what 's going on here , Colonel . Our reserves are gone . All of our power is gone . Uh , Dr. Dale Volker . I 'm 34 years old , and despite what you may or may not have heard from a certain Scottish person , I like to think that I 'm a pretty fine astrophysicist . I mean , they don 't send you to work on solving the mysteries of the universe on other planets if you 're a hack , right ? So ... that 's all I have to say . And we can 't all be Mozarts , right ? Some of us are ... Salieris . Not that there 's anything wrong with that . I ... I like Salieri . I find his music is , uh ... it 's , uh ... it 's soothing . I 'm not suggesting that he 's Mozart , either . Although Mozart did go a little nuts , didn 't he ? All right , I 'm done . He 's maybe a Schubert at best . Or an Elgar . I 'm done , Eli . The lights went off in my compartment . Yeah , it 's the same all over . Well , why ? Why does everybody think that I know everything ? Eli ! Eli ! Eli ! Eli ! Chloe ? Oh ! Not funny , Eli ! It wasn 't me ! We had a power failure or something . I was on my way to go ... Well , I 'm freezing , and I can 't see ! Wait ... Here , let me help . Oh ! Sorry ! Sorry ... Everything just stopped and went pitch black . I completely freaked . Yeah , we heard . How was the shower ? Fine , thanks for asking . Look , just go find out what 's going on . I 'm okay . Here , here , it 's something , anyway . Don 't make Any long distance phone calls . Thanks . Eli ? Yeah ! Wait for me ? Sure . Turn around . Sure . So it wasn 't anything you did ? Since I arrived , I have been unable to access any of the core systems , power , navigation , or propulsion . Why didn 't you bring somebody else in on this ? Because I 'm the only qualified person ! You see , this is what I 'm talking about . Maybe it 's like a lantian device . You need the ancient gene to access the ... Destiny predates that technology . You know that for a fact ? Yes , Colonel ! I know many , many things for a fact ! I know you asked Gorman to poke around in the weapons systems , for a fact ! I know you have ordered teams of people all over the ship to do things that they know nothing about for a fact ! Right . You think all those things add up to this , Rush ? Does that make sense to you ? Look ... Look ! No , you 're right . You are right . It was your reckless , pointless attempt to dial Earth that robbed me of the time I needed to solve this problem ! Well , maybe we 're just missing something . Yes , the opportunity of a lifetime ! Because you wouldn 't listen to me ! T.J , this is Young . We could use a medic in the gate room . I refuse to be held responsible for this situation ! - Nobody 's blaming you . - I ran out of time ! We can fix this . Fix this ? What do you think , just because you give the order that it 's possible ? There is no more power ! Destiny saved every last ounce of its reserves for life support , and I 've seen it happening ! I 've seen it being sequestered away from me ! I tried to ... I tried to stop it . I tried to stop it , but I couldn 't . Rush ... in a few days ' time , this ... this ship will go dark ! It will go dark and-and cold ... T.J. , now . Okay , uh ... I 'm , um , Sergeant Hunter Riley . I 'm one day short of my 30th birthday . Um ... . I grew up on a farm . I have relatives who 've never even left the state , and here I am halfway across the universe , so ... no regrets . So ... Rush was right . Everything but life support is dead . Well , why now ? Why just when we show up ? Because we just showed up . Well , there 's the Stargate . It 's a power hog , and we had it on all day yesterday . There 's still some power , and the shields are still working to some degree . Again , that 's to keep us alive . For how long ? We 're going to have to wait for Rush to wake up for an answer to that one . T.J. says he 's not going to be up for a while . So ... where does that leave us ? - Dead . - Dead . Not right away . Yeah , we have days , maybe a lot of days , but if there 's no Stargate in range ... and there 's not ... We don 't have the power to dial out anyway . So it 's a race between food , water , and life support . I don 't buy that . We can 't do anything without access to the ship 's systems . Look . I mean , I could stand here all day . Eli ? I put a kino into search mode and sent it into unpressurized areas of the ship Looking for an active console somewhere . Nothing yet . Also , I was looking into if there 's any way we could integrate the shuttle 's power With the ship 's system ? So you 're working the problem . Yeah . Does the computer-hacking dropout have to save our asses ... The dropout is still here . Or are you going to get your head out of yours ? The shuttle idea 's pretty good . Yeah , there might be a work-around . Well , let 's do that . Thank you , Eli . Uh , by the way , it 's ... Mit dropout . You want a gold star for that ? No , I just ... do something . I 'm going to be gone for a few hours . Gone ? To report this mess . If you need me , yank me back . Lieutenant Matthew Scott . I 'm 26 years old , and ... I 'd like to say a prayer for all of us , if that 's okay . Sure , yeah . Whatever you want . The lord is my shepherd , I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures , he leadeth me to still waters ... I 'll take it from here , Peter . Again ? What can I say ? I 'm a glutton for punishment . Okay . What 's going on , Sergeant ? Actually , I was coming to ask you . Colonel Young went back to report . I 'm Colonel Telford . I 'd like to speak with Dr. Rush immediately . Oh , uh , well , he 's had a nervous breakdown , sir . What ? But I can take you to Lieutenant Scott . He 's in the shuttle . Wow , that was quick . It doesn 't take very long to say " we 're screwed . " I 'm sorry , sir . I wish there was something we could do . There is . I 'll shout down when she 's ready to see you . Lieutenant Tamara Johansen . I 'm a paramedic . I actually quit my job a few weeks ago . I shouldn 't even be here . To think , I could have missed all of this . Hey ... Emily ... No , don 't . I said that you could come in , but that 's all . Okay . Scott , Johansen , a word , please . There 's no power except for the shuttle ? Sir , you already know that . Matt , this is Colonel Telford . That 's right . Now , would either of you two officers care to explain How Colonel young managed to let things fall apart so fast ? There was no way of knowing this was going to happen ... You 're saying Rush didn 't see it coming ? That 's what I thought . I want to know what 's really going on aboard this ship . It 's just , it 's ridiculous . It 's true . Let 's say that it is . Why ? Why are you putting me through this ? Because I wanted to say ... I 'm sorry . I didn 't chose my job over you . It wasn 't just about the job . I know . I love you . I 'm guessing that didn 't go well . Sir ... how does this change anything ? What do you mean ? Let 's say that I believe all of this . I don 't really , but even if I did , you did choose , and you chose to go . I didn 't choose this . You knew there was a chance you wouldn 't be coming back . I am coming back . No . You wouldn 't be here like this to say goodbye if you really thought there was a chance . Listen , I 'm doing everything that I can . I 'm going ... I 'm going to do everything that I can . I want nothing more than to get back here to be with you , and I want nothing more than for you to be here for me when I do get home . I 'm just ... I 'm just saying I don 't know when that will be . Please ... You made your choice , Everett . And I made mine. nothing 's changed . And I really ... I really do hope that you 're going to be okay . - Hey ... - Don 't . - Em , listen . - Don 't , please . Emily , please . Emily ... Just let me go . I gave you a direct order , Lieutenant . Sir , I understand you gave me a direct order , and I respectfully suggest it would be a complete waste of time ! I 'm telling you , the ship came here for a reason ! Sir ? The ship came here for what reason ? Colonel Young ? Yeah , yeah . What the hell was Telford just ordering you to do ? Use the communication stones to report that you need to be replaced . Well , he 's probably right about that . So , the ship came here for what reason ? The odds of coming out of FTL on the outer edge of a star system are astronomical . Throw in the fact that there are three potentially habitable planets , plus a gas giant to act as a comet catcher on the outside of the system ? We 're talking miraculous . So there 's a chance now That we 're going to live ... though our definition of habitable just means the surface temperature range allows for the presence of liquid water , and since the primary 's a red dwarf , the planets must have a relatively short orbital radius just to fall within that range , which means there 's a likelihood at least one or two of them will be tidally locked , meaning one side will always be facing the star , which increases the prospect of geological instability due to tidal stresses , and I can 't stand earthquakes . I was in one when I was 13 , and I cut both my feet on broken glass . But it might be nice ! Hey . How are you ? How did I get here ? You 're not that heavy . You passed out for a little while . How long ? About 10 hours . It 's probably the first real sleep you 've had since we arrived here . Has anything happened ? Not since we lost power , no . You haven 't missed a thing . How do you feel ? Embarrassed . Don 't be . Well , you weren 't there . Your head 's pounding , right ? How many cups of coffee do you normally drink a day ? Four or five ? You 're in caffeine withdrawal . So are about a dozen other people on board . It can make you pretty crazy . You should see the smokers . You 're looking at one . Double whammy , huh ? I was going to let you sleep it off , but the Colonel wants you to see something , so let 's go . If you don 't do one , they 're not going to know who the hell you are . Eli , I have nothing to say . People are going to find this , they 're going to want to know who we were . Look , I 'll do your slate , okay ? This is Dr. Nicholas Rush . He is the lead scientist of the Icarus project . Now just say what you feel . Come on in . Orbital insertion trajectory ? That was my first thought . I thought your first thought was we were going fly into the damn thing . But no , sir . I 'm guessing we 'll get close enough to kiss , but not enough for capture . An aerobraking maneuver ? Well , the math 's over my head , but , yeah , we should come out of a slingshot somewhere in-system . Where there are habitable planets . I didn 't tell him . No , but you 're all smiling . We 're still too far out to know if they 're anything more than rocks , but we found three candidates before Big Bertha here filled up the sky . So this trajectory is no accident , then . The man 's quick . We 'll know once we 're clear . That 'll be in , uh ... six minutes . Who translated this ? You know it 's completely backwards . Well , pull up a chair , sir . This 'll be a show you don 't want to miss . So we 're clear , my definition of habitable includes a sandy beach , a tropical climate ... There 's going to be some severe turbulence when we contact the atmosphere . I 'll pass the word . Colonel , about our previous conversation . Rush , no need to apologize . I wasn 't about to . I 'm trying to explain I was suffering from withdrawal symptoms ... Yeah , yeah , I know . I know all about it . We got a lot of work . Hello there . Adam Brody is my name ... Can I start again ? My name 's Adam Brody , as I said earlier . Hello ... Cut . Adam Brody , engineer . I like football , and ... What ? Dude , this isn 't for a dating service . Yeah , I just , I don 't know why that came out . I don 't know why I 'm so nervous . No , no , it 's all good . It 's all good . What do we got ? We have your name , we have your job . Uh , what else is there ? Oh , you 're 40-something , so ... 36 . Okay ... we got that now . We 'll fix that in editing ... All that 's left is what you want to say for posterity . I always knew I was going to die in space . From the moment I stepped through the Stargate , I ... I mean , I didn 't expect this , but I knew something ... awful was going to happen . I just knew it . This is young . We are expecting some atmospheric turbulence in a few minutes . Find a secure place and plunk your asses down . Whoa , don 't shoot , it 's me ! You can talk through that thing ? hey , I can talk through this thing ! Uh ... Uh , R ... Riley asked me how to ... I asked him how the kino works ... Yeah , yeah . We took a wrong turn ... I can and will kick your ass . Let 's do that later . We 're going to pass very close to a gas giant in a few minutes . It 's going to be a bumpy ride . We 're short on radios . Help me spread the word . Yes , sir . Thank you . He ... Wrong turn , really ? You going to stick to that story ? Go , help. now . Oh , my ... 90 seconds to contact . Come on , come on , come on ... I 'm coming ! Well , we don 't have much time . You 've seen planets from space . How could you let yourself get jaded to this stuff so fast ? I 'm not jaded . I 've just got other stuff on my mind . Oh . Well , we 're just passing through the atmosphere of a gas giant on the far side of the universe in an ancient spaceship . I 'm sure there 'll be other gas giants ... Okay , okay , let 's go . Eli ... Can we please slow down ? Trust me , it 'll be worth it , okay ? I guess everybody had the same idea . Eli ... it 's beautiful . 30 seconds to contact . Hang on . No , no , no , I need everyone away from the walls . Away from the walls . The turbulence could break your back . Sit down . Whoo ! Hell of a ride , huh ? Yes ... yes , it was . Now , let 's find these planets you were talking about . There they are , dead ahead . Yes , we should be able to analyze The atmosphere of the nearest planet within a few hours . Are we clear ? Yes , sir . Did you catch any of that ? No , I couldn 't get back in time . This is unbelievable . Lieutenant , look at this . Please , everyone ... You sure missed a great show , sir . Please , everyone be quiet ! Our trajectory has changed . Oh , no . Changed ? The planet has altered Destiny 's course more than we hoped . What are you talking about , Rush ? Lieutenant , what the hell 's he talking about ? @ andromeda

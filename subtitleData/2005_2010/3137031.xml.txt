We 've still got his shoes , do you want me to send them round ? No hurry . Tom ? Is there a man 's dressing gown in there ? I was kind of hoping you wouldn 't notice it . Was specifically pointing it out part of the plan ? Old boyfriend ? He is now . Twins in the family ? Either of you ? Well , there 's news on that . It 's twins . But we had scans .

Ho-li-day . I 'll be with you shortly . There 's sombody on the door if you want anything . I warned you about the coffee , didn 't I ? Remember you said " rich " on the day you took my family . On the day you took my children and put my husband in a box . Remember you said " rich " . I apologise for the coffee . Hello ? - Quite a handful , isn 't she ? - Who 's speaking ? And attractive , too , I 'm sure you 've noticed . But then , you have quite an eye for the ladies , don 't you , Mr Syme ? Pot , kettle ... Although I 'm not sure I 'd trust you with the wife of a friend . Pot , kettle ... Who is this ? Who 's speaking ? Miranda Callendar , private investigator . Mrs Jackman paid me to follow her husband , and your organisation paid me to stop . Peter , can I have a word with you ? Just , sorry ... And you are Peter Syme , a lifelong friend of Tom Jackman . And his principle betrayer , and abducter of his wife . Abducter ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 've just watched her being driven into your offices . I 'd say it was a pretty four on abduction . Although , maybe you just lock women up in your basement recreationally . Pot , kettle ... Min ! I haven 't the slightest idea what you 're talking about . Some woman called Miranda Callendar , check her out , please . A private detective . She says we paid her off for something . - Peter , excuse me ... - What is it ? - May . - Peter . Thanks . - What is it ? - Can we talk outside ? Why ? Mr Syme ...

I want to speak to the real actual Winston Churchill . I 'm such a fan . Winston Churchill ? If you 're lucky , I 'll introduce you . The best holiday ever !

Would your husband let me do this ? Come on ! Would your husband let me do that ? Please . Just leave him . You see what I 'm saying ? Would you let me do that ? What do you think ? Yes . He would .

We could eat here tonight , what d 'you think ? I haven 't booked . I 'll flirt with the maÃ®tre d ' . - Kind of late , isn 't it ? - What for ? Ice cream van . There isn 't any ice cream van . Tom , there were too many of them . I know . And anyway ... I don 't want the kind of man that gets involved in that kind of fight . Don 't you ? Of course I don 't . Okay . I 'm off to flirt with the maÃ®tre d ' . Lighten up , or I 'm going all the way . - Someone coming ? - What ? Why have you brought three ? You asked for three . - D 'you want me to take it away - Yes . No problem . Right . I 'm gonna see what I can do about a table . Don 't wait up . Sorry . No problem , sir . Could you sign for the drinks ? Thank you , sir . Have a good evening . I told you . I think he went out the window . Why would he go out the window ? Where would he go ? It 's funny . Just don 't know why I want to hurt you . Don 't even know your name . Don 't know my name . Please . Just woke up wanting to hurt you . Please don 't . I was born to hurt you . And you know what ? It just never gets old . What do you say , lover ? Ready to go again ? Please , don 't ! Just let me . Now , now . It 'll be over in a minute . Finishing touches . Look at this ! Please ! What ? She 'll be here any second . Oh , jolly good . Do sit down . Thank you ... Just to remind us why we 're all here . I hope your hand is as strong as you think it is . No , you don 't . Ah , Claire . Mrs Jackman . Mrs Jackman . Miranda Callendar , I think you know , who you employed to follow your husband . She 's been a little unforthcoming on what she found . Do I get a refund ? And this is Min , her assistant . Actually , I 'm a detective too . No , she isn 't . - I 'm on the cusp . - No , you 're not . - It 's a gray area . - Min ! And this is Katherine Reimer , I 'm sure Tom 's mentioned her . I 've heard a lot about you , Mrs Jackman . Well , I 've heard bloody nothing about you , dear . I work for your husband . And you dress like that when you do , or do you wear clothes ? - I wear clothes . - Does he notice ? Half the time . As you can see , everyone here is aware of your husband 's interesting condition . Great . You all knew . Fantastic . No one think it was worth telling me ? I married a werewolf , someone could 've mentioned it . You didn 't marry a werewolf , Mrs Jackman , you married Dr Jekyll . Dr Jekyll ? Dr Henry Jekyll . Died in Edinburgh in 1886 . Dr Jekyll ... and Mr Hyde ? " Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde " was a story . - It wasn 't . - No , it isn 't . Sorry . I just ... Just trying to catch on here , just trying to be clear . I married Dr Jekkyl and Mr Hyde ? Yes , you did . Come on , seriously . I 'm Mrs Jekyll Hyde ? Yes , you are . Isn 't that just typical ? That 's so like a man . There 's always something they 're not telling you . " Sorry hun , should have mentioned , I 'm Dracula . " - This is not a joke . - This is not serious . Henry Jekyll died without issue , he 's the last of the Jekyll line . I 'm sorry ? That means no children . I know what it means ! Tom Jackman can 't be Jekyll 's descendent , because Henry Jekyll had no descendents . That doesn 't make any sense . None , whatsoever . What has Tom told you about his parents ? He was fostered . His mother abandoned him . On a railway platform in Belfast in 1967 . Six months after he was born . I don 't believe that . You don 't think he was abandoned ? I don 't think he was born . Excuse me . But please ... I don 't wanna miss anything . We 're ready then ? As soon as you give the word . Is she there ? How 's she been ? Well , Venice , she 's jetlagged . I should 've contemplated it . OK , off you go , might as well get started . I 'm just gonna say this again . You know that there 's no guarantee . I know . Good luck . OK everyone , it 's a go . We 're gonna have to clear the room . Miss Utterson ? We 're clearing the room now . Of course . Where are you ? I went to the hospital . I don 't know , I feel ... You 've been gone a whole night ! Where have you been ? I don 't know , I woke up on the beach . Claire , it 's weird , I feel ... I feel ... You feel what ? Fantastic ! I feel fantastic ! - What 've you been doing ? - I don 't know , I just ... I feel ... I don 't need my glasses . What ? My glasses , I don 't need them , I don 't even know where they are . I can see perfectly , 20 / 20 vision . Its ' like being a kid again , I can see ! Do you have your wallet ? My wallet ? Have you had a bang on the head ? Tom , you 're not making any sense ! How could a bang on the head fix my eyesight ? I don 't know ! Tom , something 's happened to you , something bad , and it hasn 't fixed your eyesight ! Just check your wallet . For God 's sake , I 'm telling you I can see . Tom , where 's the hospital , I 'm coming over . Where 's the hospital ? Shit ! No ! Get in ... - Is everything OK ? - What ? Are you alright in there ? I 'm fine . Jesus ! Who are you ? What are you ? This way . Sorry about the lights . Watch your step . I mean , you gotta think " fixer upper " . There 's a lot of potentiel here , there 's a lot of rooms . Okay . I can read a face , mate . There 's a couple of rentals in Hammersmith . They 'll probably be more up your street . I mean , this place ... I know I shouldn 't say , but quite honestly ... I wouldn 't lock up my worst enemy in this place . i would . Dr Henry Jekyll died in Edinburgh in 1886 . Six months after his death , all of his research notes , plus whatever survived from his various experiments pass on to the ownership of a newly formed company , Klein Utterson . Klein Utterson still survived to this day . And how do you find the Mason employer , Mr Syme ? American . And initially Scottish . That 's a frightening combination . Klein Utterson also took possession of something else . The body of Dr Henry Jekyll . How am I doing ? Fascinating fairy tale . There 's a copy of this fairy tale with my lawyer . I hope that 's enough to secure my safety for the evening . Oh , absolutely . You should definitely hope that . In the seventy years following Jekyll 's death and in total secrecy , there were , I think , sixteen attempts to recreate his experiment . Resulting in sixteen deaths . Then , in 1965 , Winston Churchill died . And in the papers , a few months later , a silly season 's story ... about our old friends Klein Utterson and how they were going to bring good old Winston back . How ? Cloning . A clone ... created from the DNA harvested from his body . A brand new grow-you-own Winston . How 's that going , by the way ? Is he done yet ? You 're going to make a clone of Winston Churchill ? Of course not . Just some bloody idiot mouthing off in a pub . Tried to impress a girl from Hull , according to the records . Unfortunately , her father worked for one of our more estimed tabloids . Vous n 'essayiez pas de cloner Churchill , bien sÃ»r . Vous essayiez de cloner Henry Jekyll . AprÃ¨s tant d 'annÃ©es d 'Ã©chec Ã  reproduire son expÃ©rience , vous avez dÃ©cidez de jeter I 'Ã©ponge , et de recrÃ©er I 'homme en personne . Et lÃ  , je chauffe ? Il fallu attendre 1997 pour rÃ©ussir Ã  cloner un mouton . Vous croyez vraiment qu 'on a pu cloner un victorien en 1965 ? KU clonaient dÃ©jÃ  des animaux de ferme dans les annÃ©es 50 . Mais ceux qui voulaient en parler devenaient d 'un coup trÃ¨s riches ou disparaissaient . - Quel sort prÃ©fÃ©rez-vous ? - NI l 'un ni l 'autre . Vous croyez que Tom Jackman est un clone ? Une expÃ©rience gÃ©nÃ©tique ? CrÃ©Ã© dans un labo ? Oui . Je vois . Dites au Colonel Hart qu 'on aura besoin de lui . C 'est terminÃ© . Pourquoi ? Parce que Tom Jackman n 'est pas un clone . Vous n 'avez rien . Vous avez pÃ©nÃ©trÃ© ce bÃ¢timent sans rien . Je suis dÃ©solÃ© . Pourquoi tu es dÃ©solÃ© , Peter ? - M. Syme ... - DÃ©jÃ  ? Il a l 'air stable . - Signes vitaux ? - Normaux . Tom ? Que lui avez-vous fait ? Je t 'ai dit qu 'on a un remÃ¨de depuis 50 ans . Ã ton avis ? Vous allez le guÃ©rir ? Non . On I 'a dÃ©jÃ  guÃ©ri . Mme Jackman devrait venir avec nous . - Pourquoi ? - C 'est son droit . Et elles ? Elles vont devoir rester ici . Pourquoi ? Ne vous en faites pas , Mme Jackman , allez-y . Allez voir votre mari . Nous nous reverrons bientÃ´t . Oui , Ã  bientÃ´t . C 'est vraiment dommage . Vous auriez dÃ» travailler pour moi . Vous avez dit que je n 'avais rien . Rien du tout , mais vous Ã©tiez Ã  Ã§a du but . Mais si ... Si Henry Jekyll n 'a pas eu de descendance , si Tom Jackman n 'est pas un clone , alors d 'oÃ¹ vient-il ? J 'espÃ©rais que vous alliez nous le dire , parce que ... Nous n 'en savons rien du tout . Papa ? C 'est toi , Papa ? Est-ce que tu es mon papa ? Tu voulais voir Ã  quoi je ressemble , Papa ? Oui , hein ? Qu 'est-ce que tu en dis , tu es fier ? Et toi , comment tu es , Papa ? Tu es vieux ? TrÃ¨s , trÃ¨s vieux ? Tu te sens vieux . Je te sens Ã  l 'intÃ©rieur . Je sens tes pensÃ©es . Tes vieilles pensÃ©es poussiÃ©reuses . Je sens ta peur . Tu as tellement peur ! De quoi tu as peur , Papa ? De moi ? Tu es mariÃ© ? Est-ce que j 'ai une maman ? Ou bien tu es tout seul ? Tu as I 'air solitaire . Tes pensÃ©es sont solitaires . Je sens ce que tu penses . Pense Ã  un nombre . Vas-y , choisis un nombre ! Un gros nombre , vas-y , c 'est un jeu ! Dis-le Ã  voix haute , un bon gros nombre ! 103 . Mon Dieu ! Dans le mille , pas vrai ? Je parie que oui . Je suis dans ta tÃªte ! Je sais ce que tu penses , je suis ta pensÃ©e ! T 'as peur maintenant , hein ? Il a la trouille , mon papa ! Je n 'ai pas peur de toi ! Oh , que si . Je viens te chercher , Papa . Je vais te manger , Papa . Tu as une sacrÃ©e imagination ! J 'y ai fait un petit tour . Tais-toi . Tais-toi . Tais-toi ! Une minute . Qui est-ce ? Un coils , monsieur . Je n 'ai rien commandÃ© . 6 , Statler Street ? Dr Jackman ? Vous avez appelÃ© hier soir , c 'Ã©tait une urgence . Une nouvelle tÃ©lÃ©vision . Vous avez besoin d 'aide pour la dÃ©baller ? Pourquoi est-il dans cette boÃ®te ? C 'est le seul moyen de le stabiliser . Il sera prÃªt dans un instant . Tu veux un cafÃ© ? Amenez-lui un cafÃ© . Pourquoi maintenant ? Si vous aviez un remÃ¨de depuis 50 ans ? Parce que ton mari ... Claire ... Tom est mourant . Chaque transformation altÃ¨re son ADN . Il n 'atteindra pas 45 ans . Il n 'atteindra peut-Ãªtre pas la fin du mois . On voulait attendre , mais on ne peut plus . Pourquoi ? Encore une minute , et il est Ã  vous . Merci . Pourquoi vous vouliez attendre ? On savait comment le stabiliser et arrÃªter les transformations , mais on ne savait pas sous quelle forme il se stabiliserait . - Nous voulons Hyde . - Pas moi . Je sais . Attention , c 'est chaud . - Allez vous-en . - C 'est bon . Qui est-il , lÃ  ? Comment sais-tu sous quelle forme il s 'est stabilisÃ© ? En ouvrant la boÃ®te . Et aprÃ¨s ? Soit tu ramÃ¨nes le Dr Jackman Ã  la maison , soit Hyde reste ici . Ils sont tous les deux mon mari . Hyde nous appartient . Je vois . Dans ce cas ... Je veux bien ce cafÃ© , merci . Tu ne me croirais pas si je te souhaitais bonne chance . Il n 'a mÃªme pas une chance sur deux , pas vrai ? Sinon tu ne ferais pas Ã§a . Tu es persuadÃ© que c 'est Hyde qui est lÃ  . Eux , oui . Pas toi ? Ã chaque Ã©tape , Tom s 'est montrÃ© plus fort que prÃ©vu . - Je ne parierais jamais contre lui . - Ã t 'entendre , tu es fier de lui . Il est mon ami . Oui . Il est ton ami . - Il est chaud ? - TrÃ¨s . Merci . - De la glace ! - Mes excuses pour le cafÃ© . Alors , qu 'est-ce que vous attendez ? Sortez mon mari de cette foutue boÃ®te .
